Okay, can that be your new name tonight?

18
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,360
Crunchy the Bagel Queen?

19
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,360
No.

20
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,360
Please?

21
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,360
No.

22
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,360
Okay.

23
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,360
Also joining us, say hello to Tech Master Loki.

24
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,360
Hello.

25
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,360
How are you doing Tech Master Loki?

26
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,360
I'm doing fine.

27
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,360
Good.

28
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,480
See, I remembered your guys' names even though Crunchy the Bagel Queen wants to go buy something

29
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,480
else tonight.

30
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:24,400
Alright, also, I just got the finger, alright.

31
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,520
Also say hello to special guests we have in the studio tonight.

32
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,940
In fact, they had so much fun last week, they're back for more, suckers.

33
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:40,240
Say hello to the Doctor and, okay, and Rice Princess.

34
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:45,140
I like that you're psychic to the point where you can't remember your own name.

35
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,140
That's wonderful.

36
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:50,440
Okay, she's referencing a phone call we just, okay, every week on the, just for those that

37
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:54,360
only download the podcast and don't listen live, every week we do a phone call before

38
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:58,700
the show is live with Bobby Blackwolf, the gentleman who does the show before us.

39
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:03,920
And I don't know, I claim to have ESP or something, but Loki was actually reading Bobby's mind,

40
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,920
not mine.

41
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,920
I don't know.

42
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,920
It was dumb.

43
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,920
Like even repeating the story is really dumb.

44
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,920
Wouldn't that mean I have ESP?

45
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,480
That's because you're psycho and have ESPN.

46
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,040
This is really, really dumb.

47
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,040
For real.

48
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,040
For real, real.

49
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,040
For real.

50
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,040
Alright.

51
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,160
Rob, it's for reals, okay.

52
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:25,720
Chat.orangelaunchrater.com if you want to join us live and chat with us tonight.

53
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:30,120
You got a fan in chat, Darkisque's in chat saying, Rice Princess, we loves you.

54
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,120
Aw, thanks.

55
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,680
I love you too, whoever you are.

56
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,680
You don't even know him.

57
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,680
No, I really don't.

58
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,680
But thank you.

59
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,680
I like you too.

60
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,880
Rama says, I thought tonight was a repeat as many times as Jamie said crunchy lol.

61
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:49,200
No, it's, we're live here on this lovely September evening of 2008, no, I'm kidding.

62
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,200
Alright.

63
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:55,760
It's 2010 of course, we're live and we're going to talk about all the latest and greatest

64
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,120
in video games and all that.

65
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,880
But of course we're going to start off the show as we always do with a little bit of

66
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,800
how was your gaming week?

67
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,800
Dark Sakura?

68
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,800
Crunchy the bagel queen?

69
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,500
How was your, how was your gaming week?

70
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,080
I love Plants vs. Zombies a lot.

71
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,320
Like I was supposed to go to bed at midnight a couple nights ago, so I was going to Apple

72
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,320
Hill on the weekend.

73
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,320
Okay, your mic is full of fail.

74
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,320
You gotta grab it.

75
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,320
Okay.

76
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,320
I got it.

77
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,320
Alright.

78
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,320
Nothing ever.

79
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:24,200
I had to go to bed early one night and cause we were going to Apple Hill the next day,

80
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,880
which is awesome and has lots of apple juice.

81
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,760
Apple Hill's awesome.

82
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,760
Yes.

83
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:37,940
Anyway, um, but instead of going to bed on time when I was supposed to, I was up for

84
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:41,440
three hours playing Plants vs. Zombies and didn't even realize how late I was up playing

85
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,840
Plants vs. Zombies and did it again yesterday.

86
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,900
And I love that game.

87
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:51,720
Plants vs. Zombies is freaking rad and then I played some Final Fantasy 13.

88
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,380
How many times can this dude say hero?

89
00:03:54,380 --> 00:04:00,080
For those of, you know, our listeners that aren't local to the Sacramento area, Apple

90
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:06,920
Hill is a place a little bit up, um, I guess a little Eastern from us, um, it's Camino

91
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:12,720
California up the hill, I guess if you will, um, where they have a lot of apples and crafts

92
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:18,960
and stuff and, um, I mean the apple cider's awesome, but apple cider's, you know, awesome

93
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:22,240
all the time, but it's crafts.

94
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,680
No, they have lots of good organic markets there.

95
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,680
And a corn maze.

96
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,280
But, but, they don't have a corn maze.

97
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,280
They're just no corn.

98
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,320
Is that a maze maze?

99
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,440
They had a corn maze when I went there like years ago, like 10 years ago.

100
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,560
Well I had never been, okay?

101
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,480
I'm from Alabama where we have stuff like swamps.

102
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:49,760
Um, swamp hill, but they've got craft, the blueberry swamp is, there was a place there

103
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:54,400
that had a really good lamb burger of which I got lamb burger juice all over my hands

104
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,000
and wiped it off on a lamb.

105
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,760
Is there, is there a lamb?

106
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,040
That is sick.

107
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,800
PETA is going to be calling any minute now.

108
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,880
Here's your sister.

109
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,880
Come here.

110
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,880
That's gross.

111
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:11,920
And for the record, I went shopping at the organic market up there and I picked heirloom

112
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:15,680
tomatoes, fell down the hill.

113
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,920
My knee looks better than it did.

114
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,200
You took a tumble down apple hill.

115
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:23,640
Well, it was funny is that this is the awesome part.

116
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:28,080
This was the awesome part was that I, uh, when I fell on my knees, I really bruised

117
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,600
up my knee really bad, but I did not tear my jeans.

118
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,600
So you were a bruised apple hill.

119
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,600
She peels.

120
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,600
I'll be here all night, everybody.

121
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,600
But a bump.

122
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,600
Don't forget to tip your waitress.

123
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,600
Okay.

124
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,600
Indeed.

125
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,980
So I love how your gaming week is like, yeah, I play plan for zombies and a little more

126
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:53,040
fun fancy 13 and Oh my God, apples, apples, apples, apples, apples, and I'm not talking

127
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,040
max.

128
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,040
I got fudge.

129
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,040
Oh, congrats.

130
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,380
They do have an apple cider milkshake.

131
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:00,380
That's pretty good though.

132
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:07,680
We had lunch at the place has had the apple milkshakes and it's so good video games are

133
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,680
pretty cool.

134
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,800
Let's go to apple hill and pack some fudge.

135
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,880
Just like crunchy, the bagel queen.

136
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,000
We don't need to go to apple hill to do that.

137
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
All right.

138
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
All right.

139
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
You guys have earned it.

140
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,880
Hold on.

141
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,400
What I love is that your mic is so crappy.

142
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,400
It won't pick that thing up.

143
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,400
Anyway.

144
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,400
All right.

145
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,400
My mic is not crappy.

146
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,920
It's the swear bear in you have a swear bear.

147
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,600
What is a swear bear?

148
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:37,880
It's a bear that makes really obscene comments and it has two different settings on the back

149
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:42,140
of it has a switch, which I thought was an on off switch and for the longest time kept

150
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:47,120
saying kiss my ass instead of like all the, instead of all the wonderful things he normally

151
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:52,600
says, but like he will say of course kiss my ass and he'll say, um, eat shit and die

152
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:57,200
motherfucker, you know, but I have it on my desk and it just, it's a really cute looking

153
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:02,000
bear that says, hug me or press press me and like it's chest and some people are like,

154
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Oh, it's a bear.

155
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,480
What the fuck did they just say to me?

156
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,480
I know.

157
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,480
Seriously.

158
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,480
Why do we not have a swear bear here in the studio?

159
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,480
I will bring it in next week.

160
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,480
You know what?

161
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,480
I'm not going to be here next week.

162
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,480
So I think that's too bad.

163
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,480
Why don't you have the swear?

164
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,920
Why don't you have the swear bear sit in for me next week?

165
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,920
I'm sorry.

166
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,920
I ate it.

167
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,920
Okay.

168
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,920
So.

169
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,920
Sure.

170
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,920
Loki.

171
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,920
How was your gaming week?

172
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:28,880
Um, it was pretty brief cause I don't have a lot of time and place of at home, but, um,

173
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,960
you know, I've been playing a lot of iPod games and stuff.

174
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,400
Uh, well, okay.

175
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,080
Really only one iPod game and playing plants versus zombies.

176
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,000
Uh, I can't help it.

177
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
It's so addicting.

178
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,200
Um, but yeah, it's, it's an awesome game, so you should get it really on any platform

179
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,840
that you can.

180
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:51,840
Um, then also of course more grand theft auto and that was pretty much it.

181
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,240
It's, I don't know.

182
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,240
It's fun.

183
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,720
We went back, like I said, to, uh, the Lost and Damned expansion and, um, I kinda, I kinda

184
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:04,000
missed the old, uh, open world actual death matches and stuff instead of being confined

185
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,960
to a really small portion of the map.

186
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:09,920
So it's kinda nice to do that and we're gonna be modding it again soon.

187
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:13,760
So we'll be back to the incredible games that we used to play.

188
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:18,960
Um, and then since she brought up something completely unrelated to the games, I thought

189
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,320
I'd bring something up that, you know, totally missed the boat on, like, years ago when it

190
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,320
came out.

191
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:27,320
But, um, this morning I actually watched that movie, uh, Shoot Em Up.

192
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,080
That movie is fucking crazy.

193
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,080
Oh, I don't know.

194
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:36,920
Um, I've never seen a person kill more people with a carrot than, you know, in that movie.

195
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:41,720
He, he murdered literally, like, 12 to 15 people with a carrot.

196
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,840
It didn't, like, break at any point?

197
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,840
No, different carrots.

198
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,840
Oh.

199
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,320
He, like, you know, shoved one through a guy's throat.

200
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,600
He stabbed a person in the eye with a carrot.

201
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,600
It was just, it was so, the movie, it, from the beginning, was just so over the top.

202
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,520
What the fuck movie is this?

203
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:00,840
It's with, um, oh, what the fuck is his name, uh.

204
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,720
That actor that nobody knows.

205
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,720
I don't know.

206
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,720
Yeah, I can't think of any.

207
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,240
That guy who did that thing in that place.

208
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,640
Yeah.

209
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:13,920
But no, it's a really, um, really just over the top movie.

210
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,240
If they spend, like, two minutes where it's just kinda, okay, normal, and then it's just,

211
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,120
like, boom, all action, just all the time.

212
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,120
Like, over the top.

213
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,120
Over the top action.

214
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,120
Just gratuitous.

215
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,080
They're having sex in a gunfight at the same time.

216
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:32,840
I mean, there's, oh, there, there's parts where he is, um, he was doing something with

217
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,840
a baby.

218
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,840
Oh.

219
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,840
Oh my.

220
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:39,880
Shoot Em Up is a 2007 action film starring Clive Owen, Clive Owen, Paul Giamatti, and

221
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,880
Monica Bellucci.

222
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,240
She was the hot chick in The Matrix, huh?

223
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,600
And she was the hot chick in that movie, too.

224
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:50,120
She was a, she was a lactating prostitute that he brought the baby to, to feed.

225
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,120
Wow.

226
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,560
Sounds like a real family fun film.

227
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,240
No, it's awesome, though.

228
00:09:54,240 --> 00:10:00,200
Seriously, it is, like, such an awesome movie, and I do idolize the fact that he killed people

229
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,200
that annoyed him.

230
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,600
Like, he's all, you know, my pet pet, like, there's, like, one part, after a gunfight,

231
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:08,000
they're, like, getting away from these bad guys, and this guy cuts them off without,

232
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,680
you know, he's merged lanes without signaling.

233
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:14,960
So he chased the guy down, slammed him off the road, and then, you know, made him get

234
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,960
in a car accident.

235
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:19,880
There was some other guy that was slurping a, you know, milkshake, he shot the milkshake.

236
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:24,560
Another guy that had, like, really nasty-looking toenails, so he blew off his toes.

237
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,000
Of course, they were holding up.

238
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,200
I could have swore that Loki said, let's talk about actual video games this week.

239
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,200
Yeah, but then he said.

240
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,200
I did!

241
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,200
For, like, five seconds.

242
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,200
This is his Apple Hill moment.

243
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,200
Just give it to him, Rob.

244
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,200
Geez.

245
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,600
No, seriously, I mean, I totally missed this when it came out in theaters, but, you know,

246
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:45,840
it was, like, on DVD and Blu-ray and stuff like that, until it was on, you know, cable

247
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,840
TV.

248
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,640
No, seriously, it's such an awesome movie.

249
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,640
Just way over the top.

250
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,840
I don't understand why it didn't do better than it did in the box office, because it

251
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,840
was just such a crazy movie.

252
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:03,720
If I'm understanding this correctly, he's killing anyone that even slightly annoys him?

253
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:09,400
Like, there's no anger issues at all in this movie.

254
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:16,440
Not everybody, but, like, usually it's like, you know, just, I don't know, it's just lots

255
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:21,540
of funny one-liners in there, and just really ridiculous stuff, you know, at one point he

256
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:25,680
gets both of his thumbs broken, and he's, like, firing the gun in really weird ways.

257
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:30,220
He uses the carrot a lot, like, he uses the carrot to fire the gun, he jams a carrot into

258
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:35,920
the trigger of an Uzi and throws the Uzi, like, at the bad guys, and it's just, it's

259
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,920
so ridiculous.

260
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:40,920
Oh, there's one scene in the warehouse where he rigs this elaborate pulley system with

261
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:44,400
all these guns, and, like, they're coming after him, he's watching them on security

262
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:49,160
cameras and firing different guns in remote places, it's just ridiculous, but it would

263
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,120
make such an awesome video game.

264
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,120
Yeah, and this is called when?

265
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,760
And that's how we bring it back.

266
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,160
And this is called again?

267
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,160
Shoot Em Up.

268
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,160
Shoot Em Up.

269
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,160
That sounds like a lot of video games, actually.

270
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:04,040
No, seriously, I think it was, like, one of the most incredible movies I've ever seen.

271
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:08,240
I mean, I think it even surpasses, like, Wanted for me, you know, because Wanted I thought

272
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,760
was a pretty awesome action movie, but this is just ridiculous.

273
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,200
This is, like, big hit ridiculous and then some.

274
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,040
I love the big hit.

275
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,040
Oh, that movie is ridiculous.

276
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,040
All right, wow.

277
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,920
Back to Shoot Em Up Radio.

278
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,720
I have a torrent ready.

279
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,720
Okay.

280
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:27,640
I mean, I have a YouTube clips of it ready.

281
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,760
Of course.

282
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,760
My Gaming Week.

283
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,920
Today, I actually played Plants vs. Zombies.

284
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,920
I'm not even kidding.

285
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,200
I played for, like, five minutes.

286
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,200
Oh, wow, is there an echo in the room?

287
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,200
Um, yeah.

288
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,200
Other games I played this week.

289
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,760
I played a little more of Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light because I hadn't really

290
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,360
played it since the week it came out and I was like, oh, I want to beat more of it because

291
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,360
it's such a cool game.

292
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,360
So I want to play more of that.

293
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,360
So I did.

294
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,360
What?

295
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,360
What's that?

296
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,360
Sorry.

297
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,360
I remembered another game I played.

298
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,920
Is she just going to cut me off for your game?

299
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,920
I see how it is.

300
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:55,920
Sorry.

301
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,920
Well, you mentioned you made me think about it.

302
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:57,920
Fine.

303
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,920
What?

304
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,920
Droplets.

305
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,920
The hell's that?

306
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:01,920
It's a little puzzle game on Steam.

307
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:02,920
$2.

308
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,240
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

309
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,240
You know what?

310
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,480
I've got to go play that, too, because I got gifted a copy of that.

311
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,480
Yeah.

312
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,480
So I got to check that out.

313
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,480
I just didn't this week.

314
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,480
You should think about-

315
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,480
It's actually fun.

316
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,480
I'll check it out.

317
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,320
I've heard good things about it.

318
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:19,120
You should think about fitting Earthbound into there somewhere, Rob.

319
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,120
At some point.

320
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,120
Yes.

321
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,120
I know.

322
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,120
Yes.

323
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,120
You're a little behind, like, many years.

324
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,120
Stop.

325
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,600
And, let's see, I played World of Warcraft a lot because it's awesome.

326
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,600
Dork.

327
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,600
Shut up.

328
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,600
You played, too.

329
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,600
Shut up.

330
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,600
I played something new.

331
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:36,760
I played Need for Speed World, which is the free MMO, because it's free.

332
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,840
It's an MMO?

333
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,640
It's a free Need for Speed MMO.

334
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,400
It came up on the show a couple of weeks ago.

335
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,400
I have to know.

336
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,400
What do you do?

337
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,400
Do you just race against people?

338
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:48,960
To be honest, it really isn't much different from a Need for Speed game on, like, Xbox

339
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,960
360.

340
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,880
At least that's how it felt to me, is just that, you know, other people would show up

341
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:52,880
in races.

342
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,560
It was like, okay, you remember Test Drive on the 360?

343
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,120
I don't know if you ever played it, but you would just see other people as you're driving

344
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,900
by in the world.

345
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:03,480
Like you'd just kind of drive by them and there'd be, like, actual people on their 360s

346
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,960
out on the road that you'd be driving by.

347
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:08,580
Except none of them were me, because if they were me, I'd be driving off-road because that's

348
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:09,580
all I did with those cars.

349
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:11,640
Well, you sometimes see people doing that, too.

350
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:15,760
It's pretty much like that, but, like, it's kind of such a clusterfuck that, like, in

351
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:20,400
the first couple, like, I guess around a race or something, there's no collision detection

352
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:24,820
because, like, seriously, there'll be, like, 20 cars piled up where all the cars happen

353
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:28,780
to start, so it looks kind of funny with all these names.

354
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:31,320
So I didn't really get the MMO part of it, but...

355
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,000
And the cops are very dumb in that game.

356
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,560
Well, but as a free need...

357
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,920
They can't figure out how to get you off-road.

358
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,240
It's like, where'd he go?

359
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,520
Hold on, though, because I don't want to sound like I'm talking negative about the game,

360
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:44,800
because let's not neglect the fact it is a free need-for-speed game.

361
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:49,920
I didn't pay anything for it, and it's totally free, so hey, you know, it's really hard for

362
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:54,640
me to sit here and say, you know, talk bad about a free game, because it actually was

363
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,640
pretty decent.

364
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:59,520
And the only free games I can think of that I can talk bad about are Yaris, of course,

365
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,520
Totem Ball.

366
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,520
That was really bad.

367
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,420
I mean, there's only a handful, so...

368
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:06,720
But this is worth your time to look, especially if you're, like, a fan of racing games or

369
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,240
you like need-for-speed.

370
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,400
It plays a lot like one of the Xbox games that I've played in the past, so...

371
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,400
Oh.

372
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,400
Yeah, why not?

373
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,400
All right.

374
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,400
Check that out.

375
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,400
Cool.

376
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,400
Other than that, not a whole lot.

377
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,600
I was playing some new iPhone games, because who doesn't love iPhone games?

378
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,600
The Game Center games.

379
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:27,240
There's a game in there called Word Challenge, and I was a little scared at first because

380
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,840
it's by Zynga.

381
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,720
Because there's words in it, and I was really scared.

382
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,720
I know.

383
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,760
I was like, oh, but I'm illiterate.

384
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,560
But I actually thought it's...

385
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,640
It's basically Boggle.

386
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,080
You know the old game with Dias Boggle?

387
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,080
I do.

388
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,840
But it's free, and you can play online, and there's challenges, and it's...

389
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,840
Did I mention free?

390
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,840
The free part's good.

391
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:47,120
So is that why it's called Word Challenge?

392
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,120
Word Challenge?

393
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,120
Yes, because it involves words.

394
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,120
And it's challenging.

395
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,120
Okay.

396
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,720
It's challenging, because some of these words, I'm like, I never knew that was a word.

397
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,720
Like the?

398
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,720
Like what?

399
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,720
I don't know.

400
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,720
What does that mean?

401
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,720
You want to play around on here?

402
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,720
You made that word up.

403
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,680
Every obscure three-letter word.

404
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,680
You know.

405
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,680
That's like playing Scrabble Solitaire.

406
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,680
What does it all mean?

407
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,680
I guess.

408
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,680
I don't know.

409
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,680
I could go in and look up some obscure words.

410
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,320
They have that one game that's on the App Store now.

411
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,400
It's like some pirate version of Scrabble, where all the words are like R.

412
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:21,440
There's only so many words you can do in pirate-speak.

413
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,700
R, and then Rrrrrrrrrrr?

414
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,080
No, but that's literally what it was.

415
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,640
Yeah, it was literally that.

416
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:30,900
It was kind of a joke for Talk Like a Pirate Day or whatever.

417
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,340
Oh, I see.

418
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,360
Ooooh, why do you know that?

419
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,920
Let's see, I'm actually launching the game right now so I can read some of the obscure

420
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,920
words.

421
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:42,860
I'm going into the challenges, because X-Link dared to send me some challenges.

422
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,460
And I whooped him.

423
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,460
But...

424
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:54,040
let's see what are some of the wagers eager look at some of the like like

425
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:57,240
these aren't words you think of like as you're playing these days let me look at

426
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:03,160
some of like okay you're eager that's not a word it is a word according it's

427
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:12,240
bad English it's like you're eager t-w-a-e-t way I've never I was what

428
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:19,460
wait w-a-e-t way like I did you say I see tire and I see twas and I get those like

429
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:23,540
twas the night before Christmas but way I've never heard of that and I almost

430
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:31,580
said twig but I know how to toy gives um what's a Vega V IGA Vega I don't know

431
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:38,860
that sounds dirty a Vega I think it's like it sounds like part of a word like

432
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:43,740
vegetable vagina okay the definition of Vega one of the heavy rafters and

433
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:47,060
especially a log supporting the roof of an American Indian or Spanish

434
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:52,220
architecture of the southwest cuz I fucking know Spanish architect Jesus

435
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:58,300
don't you feel sheepish now I do don't know that word all right you're more

436
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:07,260
eager and what is the Scottish variant of two oh so fucking Scottish words are

437
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:12,100
in the game I guess word would be banned and scrabble just saying alright so

438
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:15,660
anyway that's my playing that's my one problem with this game is that just like

439
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:18,620
totally you could just drag your finger around the board and connect three

440
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:23,660
letters as long as there's a value probably have a word so if you might be

441
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:33,060
able to make a word out of nothing but vowels actually alright how about the

442
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:37,820
our guests how was your gaming week the doctor well much like rice princess I

443
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:42,900
only own a Nintendo Wii so Nintendo of America I haven't playing video games at

444
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:52,300
all what do you been doing in real life did you Apple Hill I went I did and I

445
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:57,340
and I hate Captain Picard what it's first princess is showing me Captain

446
00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:03,900
Picard Captain Picard and I went to Apple Hill apparently and we ate lots of

447
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:07,540
apples and had sex all right don't make things up all right you should make a

448
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:15,900
drink named after you know Star Trek and call it Bacardi salacious salacious pop

449
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:21,140
in our chat room says Aviga is a little vajay from Italy that hipsters right

450
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:29,620
around on all right rice princess I don't know if you have anything you want

451
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:33,060
to share about your gaming week but I thought I'd try anyway I played

452
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:42,460
homework for the PC did you and insomnia for the bed and that's about it that's

453
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:48,060
my gaming week in action you need to get a little like one of those like books to

454
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:52,420
read in bed I need to get one of those little books you know that's what

455
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:57,060
they're called right but well I think that any reader device or something like

456
00:19:57,060 --> 00:20:00,580
an iPhone or a Kindle or something and then I'm like one of those things with

457
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:06,980
paper and words but then I'm like I'm like look at this game and see if books

458
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:09,740
is you didn't let me finish my thought but no I was like oh rice princesses

459
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:13,980
poor so I price just leave it for you fucker

460
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:19,060
rub it in my face loves you well you can just take junk mail staple it together

461
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:26,020
and pretend it's a book books I have to buy like $500 books for school I should

462
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:32,140
probably read them but no I won't book should be $500 I mean I realize that you

463
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:36,100
realize that yeah publishing companies are like well we can't make money on the

464
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:40,300
books we have to keep re-releasing the same crap in church $500 well and plus

465
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:43,420
they're not giving a discount on the iBooks and stuff now which I think is

466
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:50,340
ridiculous for schools well I prefer like paper books anyway so it seems to

467
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:52,860
me though that they should be given since they're not distributing the paper

468
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:56,380
they should give a discount some of the books end up being cheaper anyway though

469
00:20:56,380 --> 00:21:03,380
I've gotten a few through Amazon that are just end up being something like

470
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:07,820
maybe $30 cheaper than my old textbook for the Kindle well I use the Kindle app

471
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:14,140
on my phone hmm so then like it's a lot better than bringing a whole big book

472
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:20,220
with me I actually bought a book in iBooks this week iPhone no it's like a

473
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:25,700
real is this the first time you bought a book in like 30 years probably no I buy

474
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:30,220
books here and there but Judy Bloom it was not a shitty balloon book screen it

475
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:33,940
was actually a political book which one I know weird I don't want to get into it

476
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:40,500
because okay politics is controversial like a Playboy app on there and the

477
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:44,340
problem is it's like everything in Playboy other than the nudity and it's

478
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:48,700
like no one wants to read that nobody it's like wait a minute post

479
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:55,580
advertisement man where are the titties but no it's just articles so that was my

480

princess no okay all right let's get into some gaming news Loki you want to

490
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:45,620
start us off tonight apparently I GM claims to have received technical specs

491
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:53,140
for the Nintendo DS 3ds Nintendo DS we know what's in it now years after it's

492
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:59,260
come out stickers and puppies in myspace.com ah let's see apparently the

493
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:06,700
handheld system will be using the DMP pick a 200 GPU wow that's impressive

494
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:12,100
except I don't know what it is um running as slowed down 166 megahertz

495
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:18,340
along with two arm 11 CPUs running at 266 megahertz and that's a lot of

496
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:23,740
megahertz right no of course not which of course it doesn't seem to back the

497
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:29,700
rumor that it was running the Nvidia Tegra chips and it says according to IGN

498
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:35,460
as well they will also have a looks like a gig and a half of flash memory for

499
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:41,460
storage much like the DS eyes do now except you know a little bit more

500
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:45,060
apparently numerous developers are working on software for the platform

501
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:51,060
obviously since they showed a bunch of stuff at e3 anyways and said that

502
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:54,420
they've likened the graphical capabilities to current generation

503
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:59,500
consoles like Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 albeit on smaller lower resolution

504
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:07,020
screens that's Connie and apparently I guess it's only gonna have 64 megs of

505
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:12,300
RAM which doesn't really compare you know favorably to like you know the

506
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:17,500
iPhones half a gig see that's what I don't understand is why they can't put

507
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:21,780
more RAM in these things I mean because RAM isn't that expensive and you know

508
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:28,660
kind of sucks when you don't have enough of it it's just my thought so yeah do

509
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:34,460
the cartridges not have it on there um no they don't but see that's the other

510
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:37,540
thing is so I don't understand why you couldn't do that say for example have

511
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:45,820
more RAM on the cartridge or something I don't know it's kind of dumb like even

512
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:49,220
when the Xbox 360 came out they have like what like 256 megs of RAM or

513
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:54,060
something in there I'm like you're releasing a system now that has like 256

514
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:59,420
megs of RAM when computers have well over that I mean we're not talking like

515
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:03,940
a computer from say the year 2000 or something I mean we're talking about an

516
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:09,180
Xbox 360 that's coming out years later and technology has just gotten way

517
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:14,780
better I mean you have a cutting-edge you know CPU GPU and you know all this

518
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:18,340
other stuff but oh we're only gonna stick like four megs of RAM in there you

519
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:23,700
know and we're gonna run DOS or something it's like don't skimp on

520
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:29,460
important stuff like that but I guess their reasoning behind is that first off

521
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:36,780
the 3ds doesn't have an iOS or some sort of operating system the hog resources

522
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:43,620
and also because it's low resolution it's not going to use as much RAM does

523
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:48,740
it explain how the 3d without glasses works though no 3d without glasses it's

524
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:57,340
basically like we talked about that like six months ago no it works very much

525
00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:03,540
like those oh and I of course can't remember what they're called now you

526
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:08,740
have you seen those like for example kind of a hologram things that they have

527
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:15,780
lenticular it's like a lenticular page or something like that where basically

528
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:19,720
there's lenses in there that force half the image into one eye and half the

529
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:23,020
image into the other eye and it makes it seem like it's popping out or not

530
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:27,940
necessarily popping out but going back in it gives it depth so that's how it

531
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:33,820
works oh there's actually a person standing behind the DS and like holding

532
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:40,340
stuff in front of your face tiny tiny digital midget is how it's done mm-hmm

533
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:47,660
so there will be plenty of sex games on the 3ds then what I would assume so yes

534
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:56,660
it's powered by the force all right I don't know what powers this game but

535
00:26:56,660 --> 00:27:00,940
there's gonna be a apparently a reboot rumored of Tomb Raider this you know

536
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:04,500
this has been rumored for some time and it's kind of a duh because you know

537
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:08,260
Tomb Raider it's been making those games for times now I don't know seriously

538
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:13,220
well the last one a reboot and then the last one before that a reboot I guess I

539
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:16,620
don't know but well and then this Laura Croft game was also kind of a reboot but

540
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:20,300
it was more like let's go this way with it let's make kind of a different game

541
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:23,780
with the same character it's it's it's kind of different yes it's worked well

542
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:28,900
all those times well actually some of them weren't bad and this most recent

543
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:31,620
one the Laura Croft game is the most interesting one I think I've played

544
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:36,220
since the first two on the PC years ago but they got it right then they wouldn't

545
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:39,460
be rebooting it every few years well I think there's supposed to be different

546
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:43,020
different franchises like I think there's gonna be new Laura Croft games

547
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:47,820
for the arcade download and then the DVD blu-ray games will be these this this

548
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:52,380
reboot or whatever that's been rumored for some time and in an interview with

549
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:56,940
I'm sorry not an interview but a report from Eurogamer apparently says that the

550
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:01,620
latest issue a PC gamer I guess I get their eyes on it first says that the new

551
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:05,900
Tomb Raider is indeed happening it's supposed to be set on a Japanese island

552
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:10,820
and it will offer Laura in an open world it's a quote cohesive level with

553
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:15,740
multiple ways around the puzzles so it's one giant level I guess is how this game

554
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:19,820
is supposed to work Croft 64 something like that they're gonna say that Laura

555
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:25,060
is quote younger and inexperienced in the ways of raiding tombs I love that

556
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:29,940
quote she's inexperienced in raiding tombs she just needs a strong man to

557
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:37,220
share the way they're guessing holiday 2011 for Xbox 360 PlayStation 3 and PC

558
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:41,500
notice how I left out the Wii as long as you can lock everybody in the freezer

559
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:47,940
I'll be happy she looks so mad in that picture but a little picture yeah I you

560
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:52,900
know obviously I really like the game that was on Xbox so it's kind of the

561
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:56,860
download that's coming out on the other platforms really soon so if that's kind

562
00:28:56,860 --> 00:29:00,460
of the direction they're going with it I'm I'm all for it although it's not

563
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:03,220
supposed to be that they've said it's gonna be a completely different kind of

564
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:07,900
game I guess more like the original but I don't know like the latest game on the

565
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:13,060
arcade kind of has me excited about Lara Croft again so this could be good I

566
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:16,500
liked back when the early rumors were suggesting it was more of a survival

567
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:19,900
horror game like if that's true and I think that's awesome that doesn't even

568
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:25,420
make sense though how is there a segue between Tomb Raider and then oh did you

569
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:28,900
ever see the descent the movie the descent did see the where it's all the

570
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,700
chicks in the cave and it's like one of the scariest movies I've ever seen

571
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:56,220
oh come on I don't think I've ever seen a scarier movie than the descent but it

572
00:29:56,220 --> 00:30:05,020
wasn't that the whole time like I've seen much scarier movies than that like

573
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:16,300
the Care Bears movie shit was scary man Pokemon three assholes like you know

574
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:22,860
caverns or something like that fraggle rock the movie give you nightmares it

575
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:26,740
didn't really give me nightmares it actually like I bet I'm so I'm kind of

576
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:30,180
sick like it actually made me want to go like explore a cave just so I could get

577
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:35,900
scared more I want well hold on and now you know though what every gay guy in

578
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:41,620
Ammon our County does rob rice princess I wanted to go spelunking were you gonna

579
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:47,700
go I asked spelunking you'll laugh if I tell you the only movie that gave me

580
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:52,300
nightmares huh poltergeist 3 some of the poltergeist movies were kind of scary it

581
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:57,660
was the mirrors freaked out over mirrors for like a week I'm not even kidding

582
00:30:57,660 --> 00:31:01,140
about the Care Bears movie like there's this one part where they go into the fun

583
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:05,660
house and it's like the guy's chasing him and he looks like you know crazy and

584
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:09,460
I'm just like ah I love it oh no we watched labyrinth last night and I always

585
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:12,860
get freaked out with the creatures that take their heads off I know they're no

586
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:15,480
that when I was a little kid I would fast forward through that scene like no

587
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:21,100
joke scared the crap out of me and you guys are fucking trivializing my

588
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:26,940
this is have to do a Tomb Raider scary forest and then rice princess and I

589
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:34,300
earlier we were talking about you know return to Oz and I'm sorry like I don't

590
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:38,340
know how like any of you that are in like your late 20s early 30s that saw

591
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:44,420
return to Austin it was in theaters that movie scarred me like it was she had the

592
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:49,020
fucking head glasses it was scary it was based off the directly off the books

593
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:53,980
yeah like all you know watered down like the other movie and I think that they

594
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:58,380
should do more of those types of movies okay I gotta get watered down I gotta go

595
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:02,180

621
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:42,360
who Atari launched this thing called Atari go and they want to make classic

622
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:47,100
games good for social gaming ooh

623
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:54,620
basically Tom Kozak who is the executive VP of online and mobile gaming said that

624
00:34:54,620 --> 00:35:03,100
they're gonna use Atari's catalog and independent developers to I guess provide

625
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:08,060
more casual and online social gaming basically it's here's our old shit you

626
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:13,900
don't have an Atari play this and I could go no sir you're wrong I have

627
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:18,540
several I don't need your online blaming we've played their games on like every

628
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:23,740
system that's been released ever yay I can play Missile Command again and then

629
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:27,660
like I could put mr. awesome on my friends list on Facebook and then just

630
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:31,140
you know get all these little like pokes and graphics about how much better he is

631
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:35,180
at Missile Command to me why can't we just like have Atari go sit in their

632
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:41,620
corner and stop putting out their old shit how about Atari no well they're

633
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:45,460
also though are doing more things for the core games as well like they have a

634
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:51,300
Facebook tie-in that's going to unlock extra con or might unlock extra content

635
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:56,180
for test drive unlimited 2 and then asteroids online and deer hunter deer

636
00:35:56,180 --> 00:36:01,420
hunter online are they're gonna be reimaginings of those in a socialized

637
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:09,700
context and I quoted that how does one socialize and asteroids hey rock dude I

638
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:14,420
shot your rock oh yeah well my rocks now three that's what's gonna be on Facebook

639
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:18,460
like it'll come up and it'll be all Jamie shot your rock and asteroids click

640
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:31,940
here to shoot her back this is all free though right I hope if it's Facebook it's

641
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:37,060
got to be right I don't know they use they use the word that I hate oh my

642
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:44,220
microtransactions fun so yeah I will make the most microtransactions

643
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:48,540
transaction is a trend zero trends but I've been on that site recently I think

644
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:51,580
after this whole thing launched and like I was able to play Missile Command for

645
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:56,260
free that some of the newer ones were gonna have the whole microtransaction I

646
00:36:56,260 --> 00:37:00,820
literally played one level and I was like Oh Missile Command back to porn I

647
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:07,180
wonder if those different kind of Missile Command that's basically everyone's night

648
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:14,380
on the internet every day Rob oh look something cool porn well wait a second

649
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:20,660
why don't they do that I mean if you think about it it makes perfect sense to

650
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:25,980
me everybody is looking for casual gaming and porn so why not make like a

651
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:31,300
Facebook that's like you know full of porn and like you asked book and just

652
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:35,260
have like you know tons of casual games you know they could be like Missile

653
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:39,340

658
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:08,140
bought years and years ago for Rob and it was like summer boys something like

659
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:13,100
that in the back said like watch these boys beat the heat and their meat in

660
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:18,460
this crazy sex drive bringing this up on our video game talk show that's the best

661
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:24,860
line I've ever seen on the back of a DVD ever it's why we bought it for you Rob

662
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:37,180
Wow cuz you like to watch gay porn but Rob so does Jamie but Rob has the

663
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:44,700
ability to sleep through very noisy gay porn Wow at Disneyland oh yeah I

664
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:49,180
remember the clincher right there at Disneyland we were we all we all went to

665
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:55,660
Disneyland on the trip with with the giggling lesbians of orange on radio

666
00:38:56,380 --> 00:39:01,980
story the giggling lesbians of orange it was Kristen and Meg's ego to play Atari

667
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:10,140
game and then we're all like awake and Rob's like all the girls we had a suite

668
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:13,980
and it was like the living room with a fold with the height of bed and then

669
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:17,180
there was a closed-off room with two double beds in it and so Kristin Meg's

670
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:24,420
he had one and I ignored their slurp you know he says oh my and I was and I was I

671
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:27,900
was you know so we all wore awake before Rob and Rob's just like dead to the

672
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:35,140
world and very interesting like with this pillow half over said it was funny

673
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:39,420
hold on watch if you listen carefully can you hear it yeah you hear all that

674
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:44,660
clicking yeah that's all the people unsubscribing from all our right now so

675
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:52,260
so Kristen takes out her laptop this is I brought gay porn and so it's really

676
00:39:52,260 --> 00:40:01,900
loud and she turns up her computer all the way and Rob's just like we let it

677
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:06,180
play through like the biggest you know this aquatic scene that would make show

678
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:15,020
girls I don't really be shamed I have one more idea for a game this is

679
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:19,780
actually not it's not too bad I mean it's all right you know know how they

680
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:24,980
have that kind of hobby that's geocaching or you know I guess GPS

681
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:30,260
hunting that type of stuff you call it fine porn or found porn and basically

682
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:34,620
hide porn around there and mark it on your GPS you know location people can go

683
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:39,580
find the porn or there could be a naked slut yeah that's way too much work I'm

684
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:44,140
gonna do that on my computer oh I found porn and I'm gonna watch it that's

685
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:48,340
that's the new Google Earth a little click you can do like just randomly you

686
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:52,260
have to search the Google Earth for like random porn place and rent please one

687
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:55,300
time at work I was trying to type in Google and I typed in goggle and it

688
00:40:55,300 --> 00:41:02,580
brought up porn years ago it was a typo good job that's like when you tell

689
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:05,540
people at work like oh yeah if you want to see the latest so what's going on you

690
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:10,020
you go to whitehouse.com with the president because whitehouse.com I don't

691
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:14,260
know if it still is we used to be a porno site hmm cuz whitehouse.gov is the

692
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:22,420
correct oh clever how about video game news did you know we do that you're on

693
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:25,460
orange on radio once in a while why would we do that I don't know

694
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:30,900
Loki do you have some are you busy looking for making sure it up it's not a

695
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:36,420
real website anymore it used to be used to be yeah anyways big brother was

696
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:42,900
watching they were and they were amused so super street fighter 4 is not coming

697
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:47,620
out on PC I know people are probably surprised considering it's been months

698
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:53,060
since it's been released but uh it's not coming on PC because apparently games

699
00:41:53,060 --> 00:42:00,740
are pirated and stuff on the PC so yeah they didn't want to release it on PC I

700
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:07,940
guess what does that mean I think that their first Street Fighter 4 game got

701
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:13,740
pirated a lot now I think apparently they said in a recent interview with

702
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:22,580
fourgamer.net that Yoshin Nori Oh No confirmed that while the PC version of

703
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:27,900
Street Fighter 4 was a big seller worldwide wait a second that sold a lot

704
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:33,740
and wasn't really pirated that much then okay whatever the publisher has no plans

705
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:38,500
to put the new and improved super Street Street Fighter 4 iteration on home

706
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:43,100
computers new platforms high rate of piracy they said that the port is still

707
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:50,060
possible if Capcom can find reasonable DRM solution for the title you honestly

708
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:55,380
just forget it I mean cuz you're gonna waste all this damn time spend all this

709
00:42:55,380 --> 00:43:03,140
money on DRM solution and be cracked in a day I mean just put it out really it's

710
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:08,140
you're not gonna get pirated any less than if you have DRM on it then not

711
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:11,820
having DRM on it do you think there's gonna come a time when the companies

712
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:15,580
just start saying you know what too bad so sad for the people that can't handle

713
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:18,980
this but the DRM now is that you must connect to the internet and you have to

714
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:21,980
put in a unique serial number just like you do for a lot of MMOs like World of

715
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:26,020
Warcraft and stuff do you think the day is coming where you know what that too

716
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:29,780
bad so sad if that DRM doesn't work for you but piracy has gotten so bad that we

717
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:33,620
have no other choice cuz I keep thinking in my mind I kind of I'm surprised the

718
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:37,460
companies haven't got to this point you know as much as I don't like it as a

719
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:41,900
consumer it would surprise me at all if they started going there it's possible

720
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:45,860
that they do that but even sometimes there's ways around that around getting

721
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:50,620
the phone home and types you know that kind of thing you could for example have

722
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:54,980
a program running in the background that mimics their authentication server and

723
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:59,580
you just change the forwards on like a certain IP address on your computer so

724
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:04,780
that it forwards to that they've done that for a few things you know like some

725
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:08,540
of the Adobe programs and stuff like that you phone home and you can disable

726
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:15,340
that I would know so I mean don't get me wrong I don't I don't want folks to hear

727
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:18,380
me the wrong way I'm not like saying like I support this DRM to start

728
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:22,220
happening but I wouldn't be surprised if companies kind of felt like there was no

729
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:25,380
other choice and by this way of like big companies like Microsoft and stuff that

730
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:30,100
put out these operating systems and they supposedly have these ways that you know

731
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:35,660
the system you know calls home that you know authenticate Windows and that kind

732
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:39,540
of thing and yet there's still pirated versions out there despite the fact

733
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:45,740
there oh Windows 7 no we're gonna have stronger security and part it it's like

734
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:51,380
okay so that took three seconds instead of two seconds okay well in the

735
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:57,940
interest of the companies I mean DRM is not always gonna work I mean it some

736
00:44:57,940 --> 00:45:01,020
people may not want to spend the effort to try to get past it usually it just

737
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:04,780
ends up hurting the people that bought the game legitimately and all it really

738
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:10,900
does is delay when people pirate the game so that does drive some sales for

739
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:14,740
people but they have to also realize a lot of people that we're gonna you know

740
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:19,980
pirate the game probably we're gonna buy it originally so you technically not

741
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:23,380
losing sales because if they can't pirate the game they're just not gonna

742
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:26,260
download it and they're not gonna play it they're not gonna you know unless

743
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:33,140
it's a really really good game they're not gonna go out and buy it all right

744
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:36,780
hmm you guys remember the old like pathetic ways that they used to like try

745
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:40,500
to stop pirating like we're gonna put a crazy word in the instruction booklet

746
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:43,980
that you have to know like to get past the thing it's like yeah well then you

747
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:48,220
just told all your friends what's the second word on page four of the manual

748
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:51,260
yeah I'm yeah and what's the crazy you know third day of the week the way we

749
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:53,100
said you know it was like and then you just tell all your friends and it

750
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:57,620
doesn't matter the wheels I don't know the wheels yeah they for the Lucasarts

751
00:45:57,620 --> 00:46:01,060
games they had wheels that you had to rotate around at different things and

752
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:06,860
then you'd have to read a code number out of one of the slots or something

753
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:12,380
what wah wah and those even didn't work either because you could either

754
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:16,540
photocopy the manual or you can rip apart that disk and photocopy the disk

755
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:22,380
so once again it doesn't matter what DRM solutions they put out there even if

756
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:26,860
it's a USB dongle or something like that some really expensive programs like

757
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:30,900
graphic programs so like that that are you know thousands of dollars will

758
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:33,860
actually have a physical device that needs to be plugged into the computer to

759
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:37,340
work those still can be pirated though because people find ways to mimic

760
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:41,860
whatever that device is and there's no way around everything everybody's gonna

761
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:45,220
find a way around something given them out you know a significant amount of

762
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:48,900
time there will always be a way around something because if you can make it

763
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:53,860
someone else can make it again all right well speaking of a game that was

764
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:58,740
somewhat hurt by piracy allegedly halo reach I came out of course a couple

765
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:03,380
weeks ago and if you already have beat the game and you're already bored of it

766
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:07,140
maybe there should be a mini game that you should go play that is actually

767
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:12,380
hidden in halo reach it's called reach racer and it's a warthog racing game

768
00:47:12,380 --> 00:47:17,020
that is inside reach what happens is that if two people get to a spot in the

769
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:24,660
oni sword base you can actually play this little mini game reach racer oh you

770
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:28,860
all right over there you made me drop my mic sorry about that trauma I hey I

771
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:31,500
think I think that's kind of cool I like when there's fun little things like that

772
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:38,380
in a game so I just know all morning I was hearing boom yay boom yay boom yay

773
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:44,340
all morning why was Dan playing halo reach yes is that what he actually says

774
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:48,740
yeah no it has a little party mode thing in there where you get a headshot kids

775
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:58,220
go and then they put on the duck boots from Castlevania go right sorry bones

776
00:47:58,220 --> 00:48:01,820
double o6 and share bonds double o6 and chat says okay that almost made me want

777
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:06,740
to get reach that's kind of cool well the the forge editor and the reach

778
00:48:06,740 --> 00:48:12,540
anyways it's just really incredible anyways so maybe that's your thing going

779
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:15,500
back up a little bit in chat Robert M is talking about the copy protection thing

780
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:19,420
it says the pages with red paper to keep it from being copied I remember those

781
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:24,540
two there were manuals that would have like the red paper so ridiculous but it

782
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:28,340
kind of worked for a little bit like until the internet came out where it's

783
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:41,260
color scanners and they're like foil again color copies not available to copy

784
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:47,300
these CDs alright release dates coming up in a minute but first dark Sakura

785
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:54,180
well there has been something that has been spotted a new Wii controller

786
00:48:54,180 --> 00:49:02,140
oh it's actually the Wii remote plus that seems to be a combination of the

787
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:08,820
Wii motion plus and the Wii remote and it's gonna be coming with a game called

788
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:19,380
fling smash that well it looks like tennis but with a crazy-ass ball so you

789
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:25,660
have to use this ball guy named zip and you use your controller I guess to smack

790
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:30,620
them around the different places I'd I'd have to see more than just this this

791
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:38,820
picture and now there is no date out for the UK the game is listed but not the

792
00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:45,420
special controller so I don't know when they're gonna get it overseas I can't

793
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:49,620
help but feel this is like kind of like a Wii play type thing it is throw in a

794
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:53,260
controller with a subpar game there was there is no interest in this game

795
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:56,380
whatsoever not that I'm judging this game without playing it but I'm just

796
00:49:56,380 --> 00:50:00,900
gonna take a wild guess and guess didn't say it's not very good it will be the

797
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:04,220
best game of the there'll be the best-selling game of the year because it

798
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:07,820
comes with a stupid remote well if you think about the games 50 bucks and you

799
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:11,820
get a remote that's probably worth at least 50 bucks because I'm sure it's

800
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:15,540
gonna be more than just the normal remote and people should get pissed off

801
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:18,580
because now they bought a remote and super emotional plus and now they come

802
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:24,060
out with something that's all-in-one despite the fact that perhaps they

803
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:28,060
should have I don't know put it all in one to begin with so that they could do

804
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:32,900
all the stuff that they said they were gonna be able to do it prints money

805
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:39,460
dark use K and chat says whatever we is dead you guys agree no what what do you

806
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:48,540
think rice princess we have a week now I use it for Netflix it's

807
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:53,660
poop it's doing all right it's just there's I mean the games coming out that

808
00:50:53,660 --> 00:51:00,660
were our big releases for Nintendo I just don't really care too much about

809
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:05,300
like ooh it's Donkey Kong Country again wow that's awesome I remember playing

810
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:08,860
that back on super Nintendo let's not forget how amazed and in all we all were

811
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:14,300
after e3 at you know their lineup and yes I was impressed with Metroid other

812
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:19,220
M and then it sucked wow that's awesome thank you I'm glad that team ninja

813
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:26,420
really pulled it off oh but it sucked and then you know new Zelda game whoop

814
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:30,900
these shit it's just a brighter more colorful cheerful Twilight Princess with

815
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:40,140
new gadgets and shit I mean I don't know it's it was it was sounds like fun it

816
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:46,140
was it was a difference between like you know what it looks like on paper what it

817
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:54,540
actually comes out to be and I don't know the 3ds 3ds will be kind of cool

818
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:58,140
you'll have to check out what the games look like and stuff like that but as far

819
00:51:58,140 --> 00:52:01,260
as like the console releases for this year from Nintendo I could care less

820
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:05,940
yeah Kirby's epic yarn I guess looks all right it's kind of a neat design for the

821
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:11,300
game but you know like Donkey Kong I could care less or couldn't care less I

822
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:17,780
guess because care less that makes no sense and then fling smash well no one

823
00:52:17,780 --> 00:52:21,820
cares about fling smash except now that has a you know stupid controller thing

824
00:52:21,820 --> 00:52:27,700
in it all right well let's travel around the world and look at some release dates

825
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:32,300
of things that are coming out to a store near you real soon this week actually

826
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:37,420
some pretty cool stuff coming out of course dead rising 2 will be out on

827
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:43,660

828
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:48,020
guitar hero warriors of rock you know it's kind of funny is a lot of the music

829
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:53,860
games coming out nowadays people don't care so but guitar hero where he's a

830
00:52:53,860 --> 00:53:00,420
rock is coming out on PlayStation 3 Xbox 360 and we never forget they're all $60

831
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:05,740
because Activision is fucking lame and so they decided to charge $60 for all

832
00:53:05,740 --> 00:53:11,860
three games because I don't know you're suckers and you'll buy it so wonderful

833
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:15,260
let them get away with that and then they're gonna be charging $60 for all

834
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:18,180
their Wii games oh but it doesn't matter because people don't buy games in the

835
00:53:18,180 --> 00:53:24,180
week also of course guitar hero warriors of rock will be coming out in different

836
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:27,660
bundles they have one with like the full band set up which is really just the

837
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:30,700
instruments from last year so don't expect the new guitar in that you can

838
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:34,220
only get that in the guitar kit and they aren't selling the guitar separately so

839
00:53:34,220 --> 00:53:38,100
if you want the lame new guitar that's out there you're gonna buy in that

840
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:42,860
stupid bundle other fun stuff coming up this week a re-release of the sims 3

841
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:46,940

842
00:53:46,940 --> 00:53:51,980
content are in the download content but the expansions that were in there

843
00:53:53,220 --> 00:54:00,140

00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:18,820
necessarily the tactical strategy game as before but it is a armored core clone

847
00:54:18,820 --> 00:54:23,980

Greg Hastings paintball to a really crappy first-person shooter game I mean

866
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:23,660
really who would want to play a game that mimics something that mimics combat

867
00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:27,180
when you can just play a game that mimics combat but whatever that's on a

874
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:06,660
question what kind of prank pranks can we pull let's see here it's uh apparently

875
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:09,700
it's incredibly fun as smart mix of a hundred brain-teasing puzzle-solving

876
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:12,940
and reflex testing games wait a second that's not a prank at all

877

Spice Girls in a video game though I just can't help it here in my mind let's

906

put another girl through her pieces if you've ever played the Spice Girls game

907
00:59:48,580 --> 00:59:53,500

910
01:00:02,380 --> 01:00:06,220
crap that comes out in between our Call of Duty games I make it snappy script

911
01:00:06,220 --> 01:00:10,980
spelling bee it's a spelling bee game on the DS that'll be exciting death smiles

912
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:15,420

913
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:20,900
so I release their Final Fantasy 14 the I had to wait another week edition that

914

915
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:34,900
about it is it's probably not good and then I don't think this dates right but

916
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:38,100
they're saying the sly collections coming on PlayStation 3 I think it's

917
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:43,740
later in the later in the year and then finally this is high-quality Wii games

918
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:47,020
for you this is one of those first party games for Nintendo that's really gonna

919
01:00:47,020 --> 01:00:53,720
innovate and change the whole landscape of the Wii we party coming to us on the

920
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:57,540
Wii that's also from Hudson that made the Mario Party games I played it at e3

921
01:00:57,540 --> 01:01:02,580
it was cute but it's another party game cute that's just like with them

922
01:01:02,580 --> 01:01:07,460
complaining on why the GameCube people only buy it for kids stuff it's only got

923
01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:12,180
kids game why can't we get people to actually you know develop mature games

924
01:01:12,180 --> 01:01:19,140
on our system I don't know why you know I have a question for anyone no okay

925
01:01:19,140 --> 01:01:24,340
when you've heard of this game that's gonna come out and it's really hyped and

926
01:01:24,340 --> 01:01:26,820
it sounds really good and you really want to play it and then you actually

927
01:01:26,820 --> 01:01:33,180
get it lately has it lived up to the hype for you you mean like Final Fantasy

928
01:01:33,180 --> 01:01:39,300
14 when I played the beta yeah I wanted to cry it was so tears of joy no tears

929
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:42,420
of pain yeah don't worry they're limiting the amount of suffering you

930
01:01:42,420 --> 01:01:46,380
actually have to endure because you can't play long hours on this game

931
01:01:46,380 --> 01:01:50,900
because they will start dropping your XP really yeah I haven't played the full

932
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:55,260
game yet and like here's here's the sick thing y'all I'm really sick oh you're

933
01:01:55,260 --> 01:02:00,260
sick here's the thing um even though like I really hated the beta I still

934
01:02:00,260 --> 01:02:05,540
feel like I need to buy the retail game because I spent so much time on 11 and

935
01:02:05,540 --> 01:02:15,460
it's a Final Fantasy games oh that's exactly yes I know the industry you do

936
01:02:15,460 --> 01:02:20,660
have a problem it's called wasting your money on shit don't do it how about you

937
01:02:20,660 --> 01:02:24,140
just wait for the reviews to come out yeah I'm gonna try and see if some of

938
01:02:24,140 --> 01:02:29,620
the reviews what they say but I mean like okay remember back in the day like

939
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:33,460
say with Symphony of the Night or like Metal Gear Solid or something there was

940
01:02:33,460 --> 01:02:37,620
this big hype about it and you play it and it's a great game it's innovative

941
01:02:37,620 --> 01:02:41,300
it's just wonderful nowadays it doesn't seem like there are games like that

942
01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:47,980
anymore what do you think Rob um I don't know I thought Final Fantasy 13 was

943
01:02:47,980 --> 01:02:51,380
pretty awesome and it had a lot of hype behind it I mean not 14 but 13 was

944
01:02:51,380 --> 01:02:56,580
pretty good I don't know sometimes the hype machine can kind of ruin games like

945
01:02:56,580 --> 01:02:59,580
I think part of the reason I didn't want to buy Halo Reach is that like you just

946
01:02:59,580 --> 01:03:03,300
can't get away from it and I'm just like like I was playing Lara Croft online and

947
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:06,180
I actually got an Xbox Live message somebody that was like well you're not

948
01:03:06,180 --> 01:03:10,860
playing Halo Reach and I'm just like screw you I'll play what I want I'm like

949
01:03:10,860 --> 01:03:16,020
I'm gonna put in freaking cameo or one of like the Xbox 360 launch games just

950
01:03:16,020 --> 01:03:20,020
to irritate you but then I realized I'd actually have to play cameo and that I

951
01:03:20,020 --> 01:03:26,260
don't know I someone saw someone this week playing on my friends list and you

952
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:31,020
know who you are I think cuz I don't remember who you are someone's actually

953
01:03:31,020 --> 01:03:42,020
playing lost via domus the lost console wow it was terrible absolutely terrible

954

955
01:03:47,060 --> 01:03:50,860
have time for that world and all he was doing was yelling well the whole time

956
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:56,700
like I remember that game it was awful all right let's go to Japanese release

957
01:03:56,700 --> 01:04:01,380
dates of Loki's known with the US coming out in Japan this week we have monster

958
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:06,300
hunter frontier online season 9.0 on the Xbox 360 from Capcom is the monster

959
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:09,500
hunter series is pretty epic over there although they don't really do anything

960
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:14,300
with it here on the 360 interesting dead rising 2 gets its Japanese release this

961
01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:18,660
this week as well to kind of coincide with the stateside one over here Madden

962
01:04:18,660 --> 01:04:22,100
NFL 11 gets its release in Japan it's been out here for a little bit but it

963
01:04:22,100 --> 01:04:25,340
gets localized for Japan so it actually even though it's still all the same

964
01:04:25,340 --> 01:04:29,500
American football teams it's all in Japanese a game called quantum theory

965
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:33,260
comes out on the Xbox 360 this week in Japan there's a regular and limited

966
01:04:33,260 --> 01:04:38,420
edition it's kind of a looks like kind of like a bayonetta II type of game I

967
01:04:38,420 --> 01:04:42,580
don't know lots of like epic looking cutscenes and guns and you know swords

968
01:04:42,580 --> 01:04:46,620
and limbs falling off and all that fun stuff that's from Tecmo I wonder if it's

969
01:04:46,620 --> 01:04:51,860
a team ninja game I don't think it is though going over to the PlayStation 3

970
01:04:51,860 --> 01:04:55,820
probably quite a few of those same games coming out of there yep dead rising 2

971
01:04:55,820 --> 01:04:59,620
comes out in Japan as well on the PlayStation 3 and quantum theory and

972
01:04:59,620 --> 01:05:03,180
Madden NFL so all those same games coming out on the PlayStation 3 as well

973
01:05:03,180 --> 01:05:08,100
but no monster hunter because that is exclusive I guess to the 360 going over

that's it for this week on the end of that

1016
01:09:15,340 --> 01:09:26,180
fiend so something that hopefully you didn't purchase a PB well of course as

1017
01:09:26,180 --> 01:09:31,180
we mentioned last week a PB is no more it has been canceled after just three

1018
01:09:31,180 --> 01:09:37,200
months and well fans aren't exactly happy about that they are a little

1019
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:41,100
upset because they invested you know 50 bucks on the game that they can no

1020
01:09:41,100 --> 01:09:48,240
longer play well apparently I guess people have been trying to get refunds

1021
01:09:48,240 --> 01:09:54,780
via steam and haven't really met you know with any success on that but EA

1022
01:09:54,780 --> 01:09:59,640
apparently is gonna try to help people out it says the user has been posting

1023
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:04,680
about their experience talking to EA support regarding this issue several

1024
01:10:04,680 --> 01:10:10,300
users have been able to receive a $20 discount code for their inconvenience

1025
01:10:10,300 --> 01:10:15,140
while others have I guess managed to convince support representatives to give

1026
01:10:15,140 --> 01:10:20,940
them a game of equivalent value the I guess the person that posted the threat

1027
01:10:20,940 --> 01:10:24,840
originally included a chat log that shows that they were able to get a copy

1028
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:33,940
of Dragon Age 2 upon the tiles release so I guess if you bought a PB you may

1029
01:10:33,940 --> 01:10:39,780
want to go chat with EA support which is of course support.ea.com and see if they

1030
01:10:39,780 --> 01:10:43,260
can help you out and get you some of your money back that you spent on it

1031
01:10:43,260 --> 01:10:52,860
you're gross Rob sorry sorry totally listening to Loki right now I promise

1032
01:10:52,860 --> 01:10:58,500
mm-hmm yes well I'm not talking anymore so that's not really helpful we're still

1033
01:10:58,500 --> 01:11:03,700
listening to you okay I was offering rice princess and black licorice and she

1034
01:11:03,700 --> 01:11:08,540
was like oh no get that out of my face looks like dog crap I don't want your

1035
01:11:08,540 --> 01:11:13,220
licorice it's really good you want some dark soccer I can't have licorice

1036
01:11:13,220 --> 01:11:18,940
and Dan insists on eating it around me in his car and I'm like gag it's really

1037
01:11:18,940 --> 01:11:22,380
good so what I had to do since rice princess loves it so much I waved the

1038
01:11:22,380 --> 01:11:25,500
bag in front of her face so she could get the smell and then she's like sure I

1039
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:29,940
want one and that means she just wants to take one to throw it at me so I let

1040
01:11:29,940 --> 01:11:36,540
her put her hand in the bag to grab when she's all like you put them up your butt

1041
01:11:36,540 --> 01:11:43,080
before you put them in the bag knock it off all right oh yeah bummer about APB

1042
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:48,380
and all that but I feel bad for those customer service reps that I have to

1043
01:11:48,380 --> 01:11:51,020
deal with all the angst because you know it's gonna open the floodgate once you

1044
01:11:51,020 --> 01:11:55,180
hear the one person got something free now you know no thanks in part to this

1045
01:11:55,180 --> 01:11:59,420
show there's gonna be tons of people that go on there and they're like I want

1046
01:11:59,420 --> 01:12:04,780
my free stuff I bought APB where's my free stuff just like that I found a

1047
01:12:04,780 --> 01:12:10,380
Christmas card that was hello random no I school it was sent to me by one of our

1048
01:12:10,380 --> 01:12:16,140
listeners by by Rob overseas mm-hmm and it says fuck office parties fuck jingle

1049
01:12:16,140 --> 01:12:20,340
bells fuck mince pies fuck Rudolph like Santa fuck Christmas how appropriate

1050
01:12:20,340 --> 01:12:25,820
since you're Jewish now yes I'm gonna put it up on my desk right now good idea

1051
01:12:25,820 --> 01:12:31,140
all right hey let's say 100 Matt wants to know us so what's the difference is

1052
01:12:31,140 --> 01:12:37,040
the black licorice bigger and longer just tastier actually yeah if you like

1053
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:44,820
the taste of shit like which is amazing all right bro you're gross your face is

1054
01:12:44,820 --> 01:12:48,920
gross hey this game is awesome though it's not gross at all you don't know

1055
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:53,420
Jack remember this game this is like the best video game ever I loved this game

1056
01:12:53,420 --> 01:12:57,260
it's hardly a video game but yeah that's like a game show you type of game well

1057
01:12:57,260 --> 01:13:03,820
anyway it's been rated by the ESRB for the 360 the Wii and the PlayStation 3

1058
01:13:03,820 --> 01:13:07,780
and you know what that means it's coming out soon because the ESRB always ruins

1059
01:13:07,780 --> 01:13:13,140
and spoils releases so it looks like it is really happening THQ is revamping it

1060
01:13:13,140 --> 01:13:19,540
all we know is that the game got rated on crude humor quote the ending credits

1061
01:13:19,540 --> 01:13:24,620
contain audio commercials of fictitious TV reality programs for example farting

1062
01:13:24,620 --> 01:13:30,380
with the stars which is accompanied by lard loud flatulent sound effects yay

1063
01:13:30,380 --> 01:13:36,740
more dick and fart jokes my favorite yay I never talk about those not at all so

1064
01:13:36,740 --> 01:13:45,340
I'm your card you should put a picture up of rice princess holding black

1065
01:13:45,340 --> 01:13:51,220
licorice I'm never touching it ever again shut up all right I think this

1066
01:13:51,220 --> 01:13:55,980
means now that our show is starting to completely derail it's time to bring it

1067
01:13:55,980 --> 01:14:01,800
back to some classics for the segment we call here on orange lounge radio the

1068
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:05,500
classic game of the week it's a chance for dark soccer to dive into the video

1069
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:10,780
game vault and find a game that she thinks hey you kids and your spinach

1070
01:14:10,780 --> 01:14:15,620
trucks stop chasing the spinach truck and play this video game for a little

1071
01:14:15,620 --> 01:14:21,820
bit dark soccer what's the classic game of the week elevator action whoa

1072
01:14:21,820 --> 01:14:29,540
Ella later go down good end a whole elevator action is first of all this is

1073
01:14:29,540 --> 01:14:46,540
Dan suggestion okay elevator action came out in 1983 by Taito you know what else

1074
01:14:46,540 --> 01:14:55,380
Taito gave us bubble bobble and puzzle bobble yay I love Taito games and it

1075
01:14:55,380 --> 01:15:02,940
actually had a sequel elevator action 2 also called elevator action returns the

1076
01:15:02,940 --> 01:15:10,580
game is great it's the music was done by Yoshino Imamura so let's go on with how

1077
01:15:10,580 --> 01:15:15,700
the game is played you play a spy and you go down an elevator you actually

1078
01:15:15,700 --> 01:15:21,100
are in a building that has lots of elevators and you have to can get secret

1079
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:25,860
documents and go through 30 levels and then do all these puzzles involving

1080
01:15:25,860 --> 01:15:30,300
different elevators and you've got enemy agents they're trying to shoot you no

1081
01:15:30,300 --> 01:15:37,740
face so you either have to shoot them back or run away or hide and you get all

1082
01:15:37,740 --> 01:15:44,260
your documents and you go from the top of the building to the bottom and the

1083
01:15:44,260 --> 01:15:48,740
lower that you get you actually have to solve more puzzles to get around it the

1084
01:15:48,740 --> 01:15:53,620
control was a four-way joystick two buttons one for shooting the other for

1085
01:15:53,620 --> 01:15:58,300
jumping and kicking because I always jump and kick at the same time so very

1086
01:15:58,300 --> 01:16:02,940
very simple easy game two players you'd alternate times you play as agent 17

1087
01:16:02,940 --> 01:16:13,020
codenamed Otto so you don't have a timer but you do have a time limit it goes

1088
01:16:13,020 --> 01:16:18,820
into a hurry-up mode so the music will change and tell you to hurry up pretty

1089
01:16:18,820 --> 01:16:25,980
much yeah um you see you have different you get a different score for

1090
01:16:25,980 --> 01:16:30,900
retrieving documents knocking on agent by dropping a light on them crush an

1091
01:16:30,900 --> 01:16:35,620
agent using the elevator gory yeah you can get crushed to the elevator too if

1092
01:16:35,620 --> 01:16:40,200
you're not careful knock out an agent by jumping or kicking eliminate an agent by

1093
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:44,820
gun and you get bonus points completing each round and you also get an extra

1094
01:16:44,820 --> 01:16:52,940
life we hit 10,000 points as far as versions of it there is actually a

1095
01:16:52,940 --> 01:17:00,900
parody called Ella paper action which is a that sounds stupid yeah um they had a

1096
01:17:00,900 --> 01:17:06,660
two of them on palm OS agency and agency two it's based on elevator action

1097
01:17:06,660 --> 01:17:10,540

01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:42,300
changing scenes so there you go as far as earlier ports there was the ZX

1103
01:17:42,300 --> 01:17:48,600
spectrum and shred CPC MSX Commodore 64 Nintendo Entertainment System and Game

1104
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:54,060
Boy there was one plan for the Atari 2600 but there is it never was released

1105
01:17:54,060 --> 01:18:00,240
however the prototype exists and was sold at classic gaming Expo 2001 it was

1106
01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:05,400
only 95% complete though and then Sony had a mobile version of it as far as

1107
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:09,100
compilations we have elevator action EX for Game Boy Color elevator action old

1108
01:18:09,100 --> 01:18:12,780
new Game Boy Advance elevator action returns on Sega Saturn which I think I

1109
01:18:12,780 --> 01:18:20,300
have title legends set in the title legends power up and yeah that's it so

1110
01:18:20,300 --> 01:18:23,760
can I be honest about something what I think this game sucks like it's one of

1111
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:28,340
those things I remember much more fondly as a child but I actually bought that

1112
01:18:28,340 --> 01:18:33,060
title collection when it was out on the regular Xbox and kind of revisited this

1113
01:18:33,060 --> 01:18:36,260
game and I was like this game is horrible like I think part of that's

1114
01:18:36,260 --> 01:18:39,580
just cuz it's really hard and always get crushed by elevators I've seen Dan play

1115
01:18:39,580 --> 01:18:43,740
through this game just like all the time really and when I said hey Dan help me

1116
01:18:43,740 --> 01:18:49,380
think of a classic game he's like elevator action okay no I mean it is a

1117
01:18:49,380 --> 01:18:52,460
classic in some regards I just I didn't I thought it was one of those games

1118
01:18:52,460 --> 01:18:55,580
always kind of looked better than it played now you know what came in in this

1119
01:18:55,580 --> 01:19:04,700
vein that I actually like a whole lot better hmm mappy maybe mappy will be on

1120
01:19:04,700 --> 01:19:09,380

1123
01:19:17,100 --> 01:19:20,980

01:20:28,660 --> 01:20:32,060
us tonight as you can hear a rice princess and the doctor and we were

1139
01:20:32,060 --> 01:20:35,260
talking a little bit about the break music which I know you podcaster folks

1140
01:20:35,260 --> 01:20:39,460
can't hear it sadly it's copyright stuff I'm sorry you can't play it but we can

1141
01:20:39,460 --> 01:20:43,600
do it live and we played a variety of songs during that break and the last one

1142
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:47,180
we played was from Secret of Mana the flight into the unknown and that made

1143
01:20:47,180 --> 01:20:50,460
Jamie go let's have a secret of mana party and I'm like wow yes that's a

1144
01:20:50,460 --> 01:20:54,500
great idea for sirs cuz I haven't played secret how long does that game take to

1145
01:20:54,500 --> 01:20:58,340
beat though it's a really long time isn't it it's a yeah I think you can be

1146
01:20:58,340 --> 01:21:07,460
in one sitting oh unless we marathon did switched out who would be crazy the

1147
01:21:07,460 --> 01:21:11,180
doctors taking pictures in studio I don't know why I'm just kidding so but

1148
01:21:11,180 --> 01:21:16,420
um yeah the secret about a marathon would be fun I actually got really far

1149
01:21:16,420 --> 01:21:19,500
and secret to evermore I got really close to beating it I never did though I

1150
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:25,220
don't think evermore is nearly as bad as some people think it was yeah oh yeah

1151
01:21:25,220 --> 01:21:31,820
Wow you know you know we should do we should do RPG a month seriously good

1152
01:21:31,820 --> 01:21:37,860
luck tearing me away from Wow but here's Rob's RPG of life maybe on oh

1153
01:21:37,860 --> 01:21:41,060
something else about secret evermore cuz another song we played in that break

1154
01:21:41,060 --> 01:21:45,900
was the theme to Guild Wars which I think that composer that does the the

1155
01:21:45,900 --> 01:21:50,020
soundtrack to Guild Wars Jeremy soule I think is how you say his last name is

1156
01:21:50,020 --> 01:21:54,220
really talented and he composed that when he was like a practically teenager

1157
01:21:54,220 --> 01:21:58,380
like 19 or 20 I think he did secret evermore like when he was a teenager he

1158
01:21:58,380 --> 01:22:03,460
actually I think composed that soundtrack so cray-cray crazy right so I

1159
01:22:03,460 --> 01:22:05,980
think actually no I think it take the bat he was 19 when he did I think the

1160
01:22:05,980 --> 01:22:08,880
secret evermore stuff and then later on probably in his 20s he did the Gil war

1161
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:11,780
stuff but he was very young when he did a lot of that and he did the music to

1162
01:22:11,780 --> 01:22:15,620
oblivion which I know you're not a big fan of that game but the soundtrack is a

1163
01:22:15,620 --> 01:22:21,560
amazing yeah he's a talented guy so he did the music to pray which even though

1164
01:22:21,560 --> 01:22:24,900
it was kind of a and for actually it's one of the few first-person shooters I

1165
01:22:24,900 --> 01:22:28,920
really really really liked and you know why because it was made for people who

1166
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:32,060
are terrible at first-person shooters because you never die you cannot die and

1167
01:22:32,060 --> 01:22:37,100
pray it's easy mode when you die you go into the spirit world where you have to

1168
01:22:37,100 --> 01:22:41,280
shoot these like ghost looking things to regain your health and stuff and then

1169
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:45,440
you go back right where you left off so pray is like total easy mode but it had

1170
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:49,540
really good music so anyway cool there you go

1171
01:22:49,540 --> 01:22:54,420
chat that orange lounge radio.com you're playing plants versus zombies salacious

1172

the meantime some fast rapid-fire news starting with Loki yes there is an

1185
01:23:56,260 --> 01:24:00,740
update done to 3d game heroes this week you may remember that game the one that's

1186
01:24:00,740 --> 01:24:06,060

1193
01:24:38,340 --> 01:24:44,220
again it is the Legend of Zelda on ps3 and I am surprised Nintendo has not

1194
01:24:44,220 --> 01:24:48,740
sued yet like it is that close to the original Legend of Zelda it's you'd like

1195

01:26:02,460 --> 01:26:10,900
Sputoni and he's actually I believe he works for Weta so he has one damn sexy

1207
01:26:10,900 --> 01:26:15,300
trailer out there that could very well turn into a real movie I mean it looks

1208
01:26:15,300 --> 01:26:20,320
pretty awesome so that's available out there right now check out and then of

1209
01:26:20,320 --> 01:26:25,340
course a trailer for a game that I I've been looking forward to for quite a long

1210
01:26:25,340 --> 01:26:31,660
time and this week during I believe is left over from last week at Tokyo game

1211
01:26:31,660 --> 01:26:35,900
show Earth Defense Force insect Armageddon has its first trailer out

1212
01:26:35,900 --> 01:26:40,540
there and it looks awesome it's a got this giant spider mech thing that's

1213
01:26:40,540 --> 01:26:44,860
attacking New Detroit which is the city that the game is gonna take place in and

1214
01:26:44,860 --> 01:26:50,180
also looks like it carries over some of the stuff from Earth Defense Force to

1215
01:26:50,180 --> 01:26:54,300
including a jetpack and I believe there's four different upgrade armors

1216
01:26:54,300 --> 01:26:58,780
you're gonna be able to get I'm assuming one of them is this jetpack thing so I

1217
01:26:58,780 --> 01:27:03,540
can't wait it's supposed to be coming out this fall or not this fall uh that'd

1218
01:27:03,540 --> 01:27:07,860
be cool no this spring speaking of trailers and she brought up that

1219
01:27:07,860 --> 01:27:13,780
Half-Life 2 trailer did you see that freaking Pokemon real life Pokemon

1220
01:27:13,780 --> 01:27:18,780
Armageddon or whatever it was dumb what in the heck was that it's like for those

1221
01:27:18,780 --> 01:27:23,380
that didn't see it it's like real have you guys seen the rice princess started

1222
01:27:23,380 --> 01:27:26,940
watching it but then I realized it was Pokemon and I was just like it's like

1223
01:27:26,940 --> 01:27:30,020
somebody took Pokemon and made it real life and it's like obviously like a

1224
01:27:30,020 --> 01:27:33,140
student project or something was like a big-budget student project like it's

1225
01:27:33,140 --> 01:27:38,980
it's crazy how kind of the team rocket things are all you know the sci-fi of or

1226
01:27:38,980 --> 01:27:42,340
the the the effects were good enough for sci-fi television because that's what

1227
01:27:42,340 --> 01:27:45,220
the special effects look like was like the really bad like shark to post kind

1228
01:27:45,220 --> 01:27:52,220
of effects so that's awesome yeah just saying so I got this got me thinking

1229
01:27:52,220 --> 01:27:55,220
here because again you know there's folks in chat talking about like

1230
01:27:55,220 --> 01:27:57,940
role-playing games and stuff a salacious pop is saying you know what I really

1231
01:27:57,940 --> 01:28:00,980
enjoyed Final Fantasy mystic quest because I played it knowing it was kitty

1232
01:28:00,980 --> 01:28:03,540
you know that game wasn't as terrible as everybody out made it to be it just

1233
01:28:03,540 --> 01:28:08,140
wasn't Final Fantasy just like 11 but actually I think dark soccer might be

1234
01:28:08,140 --> 01:28:11,180
onto something with the role-playing game of the month you know I have an

1235
01:28:11,180 --> 01:28:15,660
idea what do you think like we pick like a role-playing game like a classic of

1236
01:28:15,660 --> 01:28:21,540
some sort that we would see who can get the furthest in like a month and then we

1237
01:28:21,540 --> 01:28:27,100
could have like a blog of how we're doing in the game and submit screenshots

1238
01:28:27,100 --> 01:28:30,020
and stuff like that why are you laughing rice princess because I think the first

1239
01:28:30,020 --> 01:28:34,420
game should be earthbound well maybe even lose maybe the first game can't be

1240
01:28:34,420 --> 01:28:37,060
earthbound I don't know what do you think dark side do you like this idea

1241
01:28:37,060 --> 01:28:40,860
should we should we have like a classic role-playing game that we all have to

1242
01:28:40,860 --> 01:28:44,540
play I can already tell you I would I would freaking lose because I have

1243
01:28:44,540 --> 01:28:52,700
school we'll have work yeah but work doesn't give you homework sometimes they

1244
01:28:52,700 --> 01:29:00,940
do actually so maybe maybe we should just pick like one night where we've got

1245
01:29:00,940 --> 01:29:07,740
nothing going on and do do this do the Zelda fest what what no I saw a

1246
01:29:07,740 --> 01:29:11,140
role-playing on a Zelda fest quit trying to change something no it's like the

1247
01:29:11,140 --> 01:29:16,740
Zelda fest we see who can get the furthest ah okay okay by like a certain

1248
01:29:16,740 --> 01:29:20,940
time limit we could do something like that could be interesting fun or be like

1249
01:29:20,940 --> 01:29:24,420
still playing damn plants versus zombies because I recognize the music because it

1250
01:29:24,420 --> 01:29:29,500
plays in my sleep now and SSG 100 Matt says this will happen when Rob and Jamie

1251
01:29:29,500 --> 01:29:34,780
actually play their magic card battle yeah that was like a year ago right no I

1252
01:29:34,780 --> 01:29:39,700
found them recently magic all right I have to let me get back into some quick

1253
01:29:39,700 --> 01:29:43,420
news here this is news that makes me very happy and I know to make Loki very

1254
01:29:43,420 --> 01:29:48,060
very happy rumors abound once again that Capcom is indeed working on a new

1255
01:29:48,060 --> 01:29:53,420
Mega Man Legends game this is as they should be this is a source telling

1256
01:29:53,420 --> 01:29:58,660
Mega Man fansite Rockman Corner that apparently a new game in this series

1257
01:29:58,660 --> 01:30:02,980
that started on the PlayStation 1 is in development they're not confirming that

1258
01:30:02,980 --> 01:30:07,020
it's called Mega Man Legends 3 but they are saying it's the next entry in the

1259
01:30:07,020 --> 01:30:09,580
series which makes it would make sense to me that it's not gonna be like

1260
01:30:09,580 --> 01:30:13,460
Mega Man Legends 3 it'll be like Mega Man Legends with some subtitle that acts

1261
01:30:13,460 --> 01:30:17,820
as like a reboot because you know it's been a good what eight years at least

1262
01:30:17,820 --> 01:30:22,620
since we've seen the last game in the series so yeah this project right now is

1263
01:30:22,620 --> 01:30:26,300
very very secretive and not a lot of information is available now you might

1264
01:30:26,300 --> 01:30:29,380
just say well okay anybody could pull out of their ass that they're working on

1265
01:30:29,380 --> 01:30:34,540
a new Mega Man Legends game what brings this some clout to it the tipster that

1266
01:30:34,540 --> 01:30:39,620
is bringing this to the attention of Rockman Corner is called the shadow and

1267
01:30:39,620 --> 01:30:42,820
you have to trust the shadow because Alec Baldwin played him no but the

1268
01:30:42,820 --> 01:30:47,500
shadow also pegged the release date of Mega Man 9 and some of the very specific

1269
01:30:47,500 --> 01:30:51,900
details in the game so it's somebody who has kind of done this before so who

1270
01:30:51,900 --> 01:30:57,720
knows could be very cool I'm excited I would love to see kind of something we

1271
01:30:57,720 --> 01:31:00,580
didn't get to tonight but I know had been floating around out there was a

1272
01:31:00,580 --> 01:31:05,900
Mega Man Doom mod that made Doom look like Mega Man Legends kind of it was it

1273
01:31:05,900 --> 01:31:10,940
was actually kind of awesome I have to admit so we have let's see when the

1274
01:31:10,940 --> 01:31:14,140
Kinect comes out we're going to have dance masters from Konami we're gonna

1275
01:31:14,140 --> 01:31:18,620
have dance central from harmonix well guess what overseas they're getting a

1276
01:31:18,620 --> 01:31:23,100
game called dance paradise in Europe it's coming from mindscape and you're

1277
01:31:23,100 --> 01:31:27,100
universal music it's gonna be coming out when the Kinect comes out no word on a

1278
01:31:27,100 --> 01:31:31,900
release over here but just to give you a kind of a heads up on what to expect in

1279
01:31:31,900 --> 01:31:35,420
this game since it is a partnership with Universal Music you do have some pretty

1280
01:31:35,420 --> 01:31:39,300
big names in this for instance David Guetta and Kelly Rowland when love takes

1281
01:31:39,300 --> 01:31:44,060
over Gwen Stefani what you waiting for Lady Gaga bad romance LaRue

1282
01:31:44,060 --> 01:31:48,700
bulletproof MC Hammer can't touch this no doubt hey baby

1283
01:31:48,700 --> 01:31:52,620
Sophie Ellis I just I love that all of those songs were in the last few months

1284
01:31:52,620 --> 01:31:57,340
and then MC Hammer with Kentucky from 30 years ago so feel it but it's a classic

1285
01:31:57,340 --> 01:32:02,420
Sophie Ellis Beckster with murder on the dance floor and the doctor's favorite

1286
01:32:02,420 --> 01:32:08,180
song Jerry Halliwell with its raining men remember MC Hammer needs money well

1287
01:32:08,180 --> 01:32:11,540
you know as you know but then I'm looking at screenshots of the game and

1288
01:32:11,540 --> 01:32:14,500
I'm kind of like oh this looks like it's gonna be like kind of a cheap hack of a

1289
01:32:14,500 --> 01:32:18,580
game I don't know I don't know if it looks really that good but the song list

1290
01:32:18,580 --> 01:32:25,420
is is pretty darn good because they did team up with Universal Music so hmm so

1291
01:32:25,420 --> 01:32:31,420
20 of the 40 songs have been announced so far so yeah I don't know interested

1292
01:32:31,420 --> 01:32:35,900
to see more in that also one other story there's rumors going around this week

1293
01:32:35,900 --> 01:32:41,140
that project Milo was canceled this week 19 contractors that were working on the

1294
01:32:41,140 --> 01:32:44,460
project were let go some of the other people that were on the project are

1295
01:32:44,460 --> 01:32:48,460
going to be using the technology in a new fable themed connect game when your

1296
01:32:48,460 --> 01:32:54,620
game doesn't have a title it's probably not going to come out yet I agree with

1297
01:32:54,620 --> 01:32:58,260
last week's statement from that it was basically the creepy pedo in the yard

1298
01:32:58,260 --> 01:33:03,380
game like just watching those videos was scary so lion head isn't gonna comment

1299
01:33:03,380 --> 01:33:08,940
on rumors or speculation but it's looking like yeah might not happen by

1300
01:33:08,940 --> 01:33:12,380
the way Peter Molyneux was quoted in the past few months saying that Milo is

1301
01:33:12,380 --> 01:33:16,340
basically a very very big tech demo so maybe that was the hint that the

1302
01:33:16,340 --> 01:33:21,420
beginning of the end was coming so that's all I've got dark Sakura I got

1303
01:33:21,420 --> 01:33:27,620
some stuff how about rock band we have the download content coming out that

1304
01:33:27,620 --> 01:33:33,580
will be a lot of anthrax woohoo I love anthrax so the anthrax pack will be

1305
01:33:33,580 --> 01:33:39,740
among the living I'm the man Indians mad house which I love that song and metal

1306
01:33:39,740 --> 01:33:45,060
thrashing mad actually the later two are live versions and the whole pack will be

1307
01:33:45,060 --> 01:33:50,460
680 Microsoft points for individual tracks coming out stuff again that I

1308
01:33:50,460 --> 01:33:55,500
have to get my chemical romance I'm not okay and welcome to the black parade

1309
01:33:55,500 --> 01:33:59,940
totally totally want both of those 30 seconds to Mars closer to the edge a

1310
01:33:59,940 --> 01:34:04,460
tray of coffin nails buck cherry out of line and two doobie brothers tracks

1311
01:34:04,460 --> 01:34:07,660
listen to the music and long train running I still can't believe there's a

1312
01:34:07,660 --> 01:34:13,700
band called Atreyu there's a band saying there's a band called ludo all right

1313
01:34:13,700 --> 01:34:19,380
that's awesome yes and they're pretty cool so as far as other stuff how about

1314
01:34:19,380 --> 01:34:27,780
cave story there is going to be a DSI where and what I heard a gasp I just I

1315
01:34:27,780 --> 01:34:30,660
like cave story now looks really cool if there's that a screenshot that we're

1316
01:34:30,660 --> 01:34:33,420
looking at here that's cool like updated version of the cave story graphics on

1317
01:34:33,420 --> 01:34:41,700
the screen well and basically yeah and actually yeah it's um commission if this

1318
01:34:41,700 --> 01:34:47,100
picture was commissioned in honor of the announcement so I guess it's a maybe an

1319
01:34:47,100 --> 01:34:52,860
idea of what it might be could be like but at any rate it's going to be a DSI

1320
01:34:52,860 --> 01:34:58,460
where a version of the game and it will they say it's done they're just testing

1321
01:34:58,460 --> 01:35:09,180
it and it's apparently going to I have a classic one and an update and then last

1322
01:35:09,180 --> 01:35:14,660
but not least Donkey Kong Country for Wii it's called Donkey Kong Country

1323
01:35:14,660 --> 01:35:20,540
Returns and it comes with a banana pocket for your it's like a condom for

1324
01:35:20,540 --> 01:35:26,820
your condom for your Wii it kept anyway it comes with this banana thing that you

1325
01:35:26,820 --> 01:35:35,060
can put your wiimote into so double banana it's a banana pouch I just keep

1326
01:35:35,060 --> 01:35:46,660
thinking maybe I'm just banana it's a penis joke at any rate if you pre-order

1327
01:35:46,660 --> 01:35:52,500
it you get beta access and downloadable skins and the bananas are probably

1328
01:35:52,500 --> 01:35:57,820

01:35:57,820 --> 01:36:03,060

you're shooting at them you're rescuing them from not having an orgasm oh you

2 she has kitty missiles and links us to a little YouTube here I guess we can see

1399
01:42:41,540 --> 01:42:44,260
this character in action

1400
01:42:47,540 --> 01:42:51,860
trying to see come on let's see the kitty missiles

1401
01:42:53,620 --> 01:42:56,340
might be

1402
01:42:56,340 --> 01:43:05,940
wait did she just throw a cow I think she did I totally just saw a cow get

1403
01:43:05,940 --> 01:43:09,340
thrown what is this Monty Python I guess so all right that's gonna do it for

1404
01:43:09,340 --> 01:43:12,300

1408
01:43:23,020 --> 01:43:27,300
stuff random things we will send out on the Twitter as well like pictures and

1409
01:43:27,300 --> 01:43:30,620
all that cool stuff all right back into some more news Loki what do you got for

1410
01:43:30,620 --> 01:43:40,180
us I've got plants versus always not I've got some cool stuff including you

1411
01:43:40,180 --> 01:43:45,180
may remember some of the things that Sony does to you know curb piracy and

1412
01:43:45,180 --> 01:43:54,340
stuff well now they've disabled it's funny because everybody's joking oh now

1413
01:43:54,340 --> 01:43:58,780
they have those USB mod chips they're gonna disable the USB ports I only

1414
01:43:58,780 --> 01:44:05,460
weren't that far off they've disabled some USB peripherals I guess according

1415
01:44:05,460 --> 01:44:11,580
to a report that was on their website the issue I guess they were disabling

1416
01:44:11,580 --> 01:44:18,620
counterfeit ps3 controllers but it was actually disabling third our unlicensed

1417
01:44:18,620 --> 01:44:25,020
third-party controllers in some of these devices affected by this actually were

1418
01:44:25,020 --> 01:44:31,940
the yobo ps3 joybox which I believe is an arcade stick the XCM cross battle

1419
01:44:31,940 --> 01:44:38,220
plus adapter which was kind of a adapter lie you use an Xbox 360 controller on

1420
01:44:38,220 --> 01:44:43,700
the PlayStation 3 and the split the split fish frag FX which is kind of a

1421
01:44:43,700 --> 01:44:50,780
hybrid controller and mouse and that's kind of lame that that's part of firmware

1422
01:44:50,780 --> 01:44:56,260
3.5 other things though that it kind of broke as well some old mad cats

1423
01:44:56,260 --> 01:45:01,660
controllers even though they are fully licensed apparently they are now broken

1424
01:45:01,660 --> 01:45:09,860
so if you only 2008 wireless ps3 gamepad or the 2008 wired ps3 gamepad or the

1425
01:45:09,860 --> 01:45:14,700
ps3 wireless micro con which is now discontinued they do not work anymore

1426
01:45:14,700 --> 01:45:22,900
so man if I were mad cats I would be pissed like especially if they're

1427
01:45:22,900 --> 01:45:27,260
licensed if they're unlicensed well then too bad so sad right but if they're

1428
01:45:27,260 --> 01:45:34,260
licensed that's grounds to like sue and stuff yes soon well and I don't know if

1429
01:45:34,260 --> 01:45:41,660
this is like meant to stop people from using the USB mod chips but that last

1430
01:45:41,660 --> 01:45:46,900
firmware update was to stop people from using the USB mod chips so I can only

1431
01:45:46,900 --> 01:45:52,340
assume this is either an extra precaution or they're just being dicks

1432
01:45:52,340 --> 01:45:56,140
I'm gonna go with the latter I think they're being dicks because really I

1433
01:45:56,140 --> 01:45:59,700
don't know about you but I haven't heard of some big ol mass problem with

1434
01:45:59,700 --> 01:46:04,020
counterfeit controllers I don't know people out there going oh man all those

1435
01:46:04,020 --> 01:46:09,100
counterfeit controllers out there I just can't find a good ps3 controller well

1436
01:46:09,100 --> 01:46:12,660
there are a lot of shitty controllers out there actually yeah but these are

1437
01:46:12,660 --> 01:46:16,380
actually counterfeit controllers there's a YouTube that was on Kotaku as well

1438
01:46:16,380 --> 01:46:21,500
where someone actually bought a cheap DualShock 3 controller that was a

1439
01:46:21,500 --> 01:46:29,860
counterfeit so you know that's kind of lame that those are out there but I mean

1440
01:46:29,860 --> 01:46:34,940
I can't imagine this is a huge problem that one that warrants a software update

1441
01:46:34,940 --> 01:46:38,980
I mean hell I can think of a lot of problems that this console has it

1442
01:46:38,980 --> 01:46:45,940
haven't been fixed with a software update like home being lame nice all

1443
01:46:45,940 --> 01:46:50,420
right well how would you like to get free Microsoft points that's right free

1444
01:46:50,420 --> 01:46:53,860
Microsoft points well guess what there's a website that will bribe you with free

1445
01:46:53,860 --> 01:46:58,220
Microsoft points they're keeping it in the family because that website is Bing

1446
01:46:58,220 --> 01:47:03,700
that's right Microsoft search engine the rival to Google Bing is running this new

1447
01:47:03,700 --> 01:47:09,500
little like Bing toolbar that you can install on your browser by the way well

1448
01:47:09,500 --> 01:47:12,440
at the first announcement said that it was only compatible with Internet

1449
01:47:12,440 --> 01:47:15,580
Explorer but some things I've been reading in forum chats and stuff say

1450
01:47:15,580 --> 01:47:18,860
that it actually works with Firefox so I don't know you I mean it would make

1451
01:47:18,860 --> 01:47:21,860
sense it would only work with Internet Explorer right that whole like

1452
01:47:21,860 --> 01:47:27,500
Microsoft only stuff but anyhow if you use it to take part in daily promotions

1453
01:47:27,500 --> 01:47:32,120
or do searching you will earn reward points that you can then turn into

1454
01:47:32,120 --> 01:47:36,200
Microsoft points so here's the thing though you can only get the Microsoft

1455
01:47:36,200 --> 01:47:40,460
points in 100 point denominations but just installing the toolbar gets you

1456
01:47:40,460 --> 01:47:45,460
250 points so that's kind of cool I guess so what I'm also hearing though

1457
01:47:45,460 --> 01:47:48,700
again the reading through comments and things is apparently they will only like

1458
01:47:48,700 --> 01:47:58,220
send you the the points in like cards in the mail like what a waste of cardboard

1459
01:47:58,220 --> 01:48:00,940
and all that stuff like when they could be sending it to you digitally cuz like

1460
01:48:00,940 --> 01:48:07,100
you know a hundred Microsoft points is like a buck 25 seriously yeah I'm gonna

1461
01:48:07,100 --> 01:48:11,180
try it with Firefox have fun give me your Microsoft points and Microsoft is

1462
01:48:11,180 --> 01:48:15,860
desperate to get Bing off the ground like they're trying all kinds of stuff

1463
01:48:15,860 --> 01:48:19,540
well you know what's interesting it's not a bad site actually their maps is

1464
01:48:19,540 --> 01:48:23,160
actually really cool and in some ways it's even better than Google like it's

1465
01:48:23,160 --> 01:48:26,500
actually caused Google to have to kind of like up some of the aunties on some

1466
01:48:26,500 --> 01:48:30,220
of their things like the satellite pictures and stuff so you know Bing it

1467
01:48:30,220 --> 01:48:33,220
has some pretty neat stuff going for it I mean it's not terrible just because

1468
01:48:33,220 --> 01:48:39,620
it's Microsoft I keep seeing advertisements and like being this and

1469
01:48:39,620 --> 01:48:43,540
being automatically like download itself on my toolbar and bing bing bing bing

1470
01:48:43,540 --> 01:48:47,820
and it's just like bada-bing and yeah exactly exactly I like that they have

1471
01:48:47,820 --> 01:48:54,260
like a neat little picture every day and they're their application on did it oh

1472
01:48:54,260 --> 01:49:00,100
no did it maybe I was trying to click cancel and I click the other thing so

1473
01:49:00,100 --> 01:49:03,300
now it closed all my windows great and it means you closed your next story

1474
01:49:03,300 --> 01:49:12,180
didn't it yay awesome oh well that's what I have an iPhone for you're gonna

1475
01:49:12,180 --> 01:49:15,860
bring up stories on the iPhone why not all right well I got a stretch for time

1476
01:49:15,860 --> 01:49:19,340
here I was ready to go on to the next story you know what Rob sometimes things

1477
01:49:19,340 --> 01:49:22,980
just don't go the way you expect them to hey don't be rude I wasn't being rude

1478
01:49:22,980 --> 01:49:27,620
being a realist Bing has pretty pictures on it that's not like about being when

1479
01:49:27,620 --> 01:49:31,180
you go to their website and the iPhone app is actually kind of neat I don't

1480
01:49:31,180 --> 01:49:35,620
have an iPhone really would you like to touch mine no it's got your finger juice

1481
01:49:35,620 --> 01:49:45,300
on it yes you may okay have my story yay all right because this is the joy of the

1482
01:49:45,300 --> 01:49:51,940
iPhone oh great now it's not loading sucker me at Miyamoto it basically what

1483
01:49:51,940 --> 01:49:55,620
the story is about is that Miyamoto has always considered the maker of the

1484
01:49:55,620 --> 01:50:01,620
Rubik's Cube mr. Rubik himself to be his rival so he wants to make something

1485
01:50:01,620 --> 01:50:06,980
along the lines of a Rubik's Cube as his big pet project so like selling a

1486
01:50:06,980 --> 01:50:11,780
bazillion wheeze isn't good enough no

1487
01:50:12,500 --> 01:50:18,780
basically he said and I'm gonna quote for quite some time I have viewed

1488
01:50:18,780 --> 01:50:22,700
professor Rubik who created the Rubik's Cube as a sort of rival I've always

1489
01:50:22,700 --> 01:50:25,900
thought it would be cool to create something like a Rubik's Cube I've told

1490
01:50:25,900 --> 01:50:29,380
lots of people about that for 20 years of us thought that the Rubik's cubes are

1491
01:50:29,380 --> 01:50:32,140
great they've all left him and I wanted to make something like that but I still

1492
01:50:32,140 --> 01:50:39,100
haven't tried to do so I must be taking it easy Wow and then he said he wanted

1493
01:50:39,100 --> 01:50:44,460
to be a manga artist oh he just wants to do everything doesn't he you know what

1494
01:50:44,460 --> 01:50:48,660
he's created some of the most memorable video game characters ever like that

1495
01:50:48,660 --> 01:50:53,780
history will never forget some of these video game characters and yet it's just

1496
01:50:53,780 --> 01:51:01,220
not good enough for him no and well he was said that he did some comic strips

1497
01:51:01,220 --> 01:51:06,700
for um Tezuka who's the Nintendo ad general manager wait wait what which

1498
01:51:06,700 --> 01:51:09,940
characters are you talking about that he created you know the ones that we would

1499
01:51:09,940 --> 01:51:14,540
never forget was that like Captain Rainbow or something do you remember

1500
01:51:14,540 --> 01:51:19,820
Captain Rainbow good point from a dark Tetsuya in chat room didn't Nintendo

1501
01:51:19,820 --> 01:51:23,660
used to make toys and stuff back in the 70s actually Nintendo started off as a

1502
01:51:23,660 --> 01:51:28,660
Hanafuda card yeah they did it playing cards right yeah hmm and then they did

1503
01:51:28,660 --> 01:51:35,420
Game & Watch I love Game & Watch it works with Firefox well thank you now I

1504
01:51:35,420 --> 01:51:39,580
enjoy your Microsoft points I will good time what are you gonna buy with those

1505
01:51:39,580 --> 01:51:45,660
Microsoft points probably the rest of the steampunk outfit on my avatar all

1506
01:51:45,660 --> 01:51:50,060
right Loki it's your turn you gonna put down plants versus zombies and actually

1507
01:51:50,060 --> 01:51:56,980
sorry I can do this so there's other Sony news and this would kind of tie in

1508
01:51:56,980 --> 01:52:01,220
with the stuff that happened before when they were moving things to stop hacking

1509
01:52:01,220 --> 01:52:06,740
remember they removed the other OS feature on the PlayStation 3 to stop the

1510
01:52:06,740 --> 01:52:13,180
hacking of the system via Linux well apparently there was a class-action

1511
01:52:13,180 --> 01:52:19,220
lawsuit filed against Sony because of that and Sony has now filed a motion to

1512
01:52:19,220 --> 01:52:23,220
dismiss that class-action lawsuit brought against the company and sadly

1513
01:52:23,220 --> 01:52:29,220
enough I kind of agree with them because well you'll see for example they say

1514
01:52:29,220 --> 01:52:38,380
that I guess apparently some of the seven I guess similar suits they were

1515
01:52:38,380 --> 01:52:42,900
all consolidated their file last thing it says fails to present evidence that

1516
01:52:42,900 --> 01:52:47,140
the company overtly advertise the other OS and its marketing campaigns on the

1517
01:52:47,140 --> 01:52:51,700
p4 on the ps3 packaging which I don't remember them doing either one of those

1518
01:52:51,700 --> 01:52:56,380
but I do remember them talking about it at e3 so or z3 or game developers

1519
01:52:56,380 --> 01:53:01,500
conference camera which one this is Sony also claims that the ps3 warranty

1520
01:53:01,500 --> 01:53:05,460
license agreement in the PlayStation Network terms of service specifically

1521
01:53:05,460 --> 01:53:12,480
provide ps3 purchasers with a license non ownership interest in the software

1522
01:53:12,480 --> 01:53:17,500
and use of the PlayStation Network provided that Sony has the right to

1523
01:53:17,500 --> 01:53:21,900
disable or alter your software features or terminate or limit the access to the

1524
01:53:21,900 --> 01:53:26,820
PlayStation Network it by issuing firmware updates and also I guess that

1525
01:53:26,820 --> 01:53:33,780
apparently people do have the option to keep the other OS by declining the

1526
01:53:33,780 --> 01:53:37,140
update and they just can't access the PlayStation Network

1527
01:53:37,140 --> 01:53:43,220
so in other words in other words they're saying you can access this feature by

1528
01:53:43,220 --> 01:53:49,460
disabling a different feature instead yes also they're saying that because

1529
01:53:49,460 --> 01:53:55,540
some of the the they should you know dismiss the suit because some of the

1530
01:53:55,540 --> 01:54:04,580
plaintiffs did not use the other OS feature in fact there is you have it

1531
01:54:04,580 --> 01:54:08,900
didn't use it in the same way I guess and or just didn't use it all because

1532
01:54:08,900 --> 01:54:15,140
you know they have ways of checking that and so I guess they wouldn't really have

1533
01:54:15,140 --> 01:54:19,580
been affected by it it's some people I think doing a money grab if you ask me

1534
01:54:19,580 --> 01:54:24,940
so I'm sure some people are just like that earlier story we had about APB and

1535
01:54:24,940 --> 01:54:27,460
all the people complaining the yeah but there's some people that are gonna go

1536
01:54:27,460 --> 01:54:30,980
try to get money that really didn't even play APB they just bought it well that's

1537
01:54:30,980 --> 01:54:34,620
different though I mean they'd have proof of purchase of you know APB they

1538
01:54:34,620 --> 01:54:38,660
give them the serial number or something like that that this is a little

1539
01:54:38,660 --> 01:54:45,060
different than saying oh you know I I don't know like for example a

1540
01:54:45,060 --> 01:54:49,900
class-action lawsuit that I was part of just because I hate 24-hour fitness I

1541
01:54:49,900 --> 01:54:53,460
canceled my 24-hour fitness membership and there was a class-action lawsuit

1542
01:54:53,460 --> 01:54:57,020
saying that there was people affected by the fact that when you cancel your

1543
01:54:57,020 --> 01:55:01,780
membership they bill you a couple more times just really yeah did that happen

1544
01:55:01,780 --> 01:55:06,380
to you no it didn't happen to me that's what I still got I got a $5 check I got

1545
01:55:06,380 --> 01:55:11,780
a three month pass to 24-hour fitness I'm like oh garbage thank you it's like

1546
01:55:11,780 --> 01:55:18,060
wonderful I can't wait to go back to the gym I don't like going to thank you this

1547
01:55:18,060 --> 01:55:20,900
is way better than any other compensation you could possibly provide

1548
01:55:20,900 --> 01:55:25,260
me nice very nice Lisa should be able to kick them in the pants or something yeah

1549
01:55:25,260 --> 01:55:29,460
going to our chat room at chat orange laundry calm for such eloquent comments

1550
01:55:29,460 --> 01:55:33,300
such as the one from Toa gak who says Sony can suck a dick what they did was

1551
01:55:33,300 --> 01:55:39,580
wrong do you agree rice princess can Sony suck a dick they probably could

1552
01:55:39,580 --> 01:55:45,460
collectively yeah let's see why not Derek H in our chair room says that's

1553
01:55:45,460 --> 01:55:49,740
like a car company removing your seat belts because you didn't use them that's

1554
01:55:49,740 --> 01:55:52,900
actually a pretty good comparison except for the fact that I don't think the

1555
01:55:52,900 --> 01:55:56,740
other OS is gonna like you know save your life at any point I guess maybe it

1556
01:55:56,740 --> 01:56:05,540
could I guess anything's possible don't make assumptions wrong all right going

1557
01:56:05,540 --> 01:56:11,260
on to more stories in our show here another rumor going around and this is

1558
01:56:11,260 --> 01:56:19,460
about more 3d games I know right I'm already over it but apparently there are

1559
01:56:19,460 --> 01:56:25,060
yet more rumored ports of PlayStation 2 games being remade for the PlayStation

1560
01:56:25,060 --> 01:56:29,240
3 and in 3d one of them I've got to admit sounds really interesting it's the

1561
01:56:29,240 --> 01:56:35,020
Mortal Kombat HD arcade collection and if you're looking at a sample box art

1562
01:56:35,020 --> 01:56:39,820
that's out there it's Mortal Kombat 1 2 and ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 kind of

1563
01:56:39,820 --> 01:56:44,620
redone in HD I gotta admit that being that I love the cheesy Mortal Kombat

1564
01:56:44,620 --> 01:56:47,460
games from back in the day that actually sounds kind of awesome I'm not gonna lie

1565
01:56:47,460 --> 01:56:51,580
being able to you know play that in three in well I wouldn't play in 3d but

1566
01:56:51,580 --> 01:56:57,780
HD and all that jazz not interested rice princess you don't like Mortal Kombat

1567
01:56:57,780 --> 01:57:04,900
it's alright I can play it in its normal form I guess that's true apparently it's

1568
01:57:04,900 --> 01:57:09,580
gonna have stereoscopic 3d support and this is being reported by a French

1569
01:57:09,580 --> 01:57:13,140
gaming website but they have box art to go with it and I don't know it's coming

1570
01:57:13,140 --> 01:57:19,420
out oh well then I believe it what about the Prince of Persia trilogy 3d that's

1571
01:57:19,420 --> 01:57:22,580
the other one that's being remember about that one yet only if it has video

1572
01:57:22,580 --> 01:57:26,580
of Jake Gyllenhaal me I can imagine that they would because everybody's kind of

1573
01:57:26,580 --> 01:57:29,900
jumping on that bandwagon of re-releasing stuff hey I'm okay with

1574
01:57:29,900 --> 01:57:32,740
that Prince of Persia games are pretty awesome it's the sands of time or you're

1575
01:57:32,740 --> 01:57:35,800
within and the two thrones all coming out sounds like they'd be a perfect tie

1576
01:57:35,800 --> 01:57:39,740
in with the DVD release of the movie now wouldn't it wouldn't it and the Mortal

1577
01:57:39,740 --> 01:57:42,780
Kombat HD collection might make the perfect companion piece to the new

1578
01:57:42,780 --> 01:57:47,300
Mortal Kombat game wouldn't it how about Jake Gyllenhaal and the oncoming

1579
01:57:47,300 --> 01:57:53,180
something I don't know never mind I try to make sex jokes around you Robin I

1580
01:57:53,180 --> 01:57:57,460
just can't because I'm distracted by you it's I'm not sure how to take that but I

1581
01:57:57,460 --> 01:58:04,100
think compliment interesting Derek H says they should remake every game with

1582
01:58:04,100 --> 01:58:08,500
parallax backgrounds in 3d that might actually happen on the 3ds actually if

1583
01:58:08,500 --> 01:58:14,260
what we saw at a most a classic gaming Expo I'd even fucking go to that what am

1584
01:58:14,260 --> 01:58:19,980
I thinking at e3 is any indication cuz you know they had like the Xevious this

1585
01:58:19,980 --> 01:58:25,340
old old old Namco game from like the 80s was redone in 3d pac-man yeah they had

1586
01:58:25,340 --> 01:58:30,300
Star Fox was redone they were talking about like redoing ocarina of time

1587
01:58:30,300 --> 01:58:37,060
they're gonna go back and redo all these games in 3d you know why it's because

1588
01:58:37,060 --> 01:58:41,540
they can just take the code they already have tack on 3d and re-release a damn

1589
01:58:41,540 --> 01:58:47,700
game again just like we can take some GameCube games tack on we remote waggle

1590
01:58:47,700 --> 01:58:51,060
and re-release it hey look we're supporting the fans because we released

1591
01:58:51,060 --> 01:58:56,780
lots of games this year new games uh oh I'm sorry that would actually be just

1592
01:58:56,780 --> 01:59:00,900
game you've got to admit a game like pilot wings would be kind of awesome in

1593
01:59:00,900 --> 01:59:04,780
3d like I have to me okay here's the thing though rice friends let's keep

1594
01:59:04,780 --> 01:59:07,900
this in mind I don't like 3d either like I don't like hearing about all these

1595
01:59:07,900 --> 01:59:13,220
movies and things that are in 3d but the 3ds is for some reason is different like

1596
01:59:13,220 --> 01:59:17,060
a you can turn off the 3d when it bugs you because it has a slider that lets

1597
01:59:17,060 --> 01:59:20,620
you adjust the intensity so it's easier on your eyes and it is kind of a neat

1598
01:59:20,620 --> 01:59:24,220
effect I gotta say being able to see the 3d without glasses is kind of cool I

1599
01:59:24,220 --> 01:59:28,420
don't know how long that'll last but here's something that kind of has me

1600
01:59:28,420 --> 01:59:31,300
thinking you know for the longest time we've been wondering where our virtual

1601
01:59:31,300 --> 01:59:34,100
console games on the DSI where our virtual console games and virtual

1602
01:59:34,100 --> 01:59:38,700
consoles kind of slowed up lately what if a lot of these re-releases with 3d

1603
01:59:38,700 --> 01:59:43,860
end up being downloadable games for the DSI like they're gonna re-release these

1604
01:59:43,860 --> 01:59:47,540
games all over again but this time they're in 3d I mean if the price is

1605
01:59:47,540 --> 01:59:52,660
right like five ten dollars could be worth it for some of these games only

1606
01:59:52,660 --> 01:59:56,140
the only the real real classics like I wouldn't buy games like princess tomato

1607
01:59:56,140 --> 01:59:59,980
and salad Kingdom or whatever are what are you talking about my favorite game

1608
01:59:59,980 --> 02:00:05,220
ever shut up no I wouldn't want to play clash and demon head in 3d no you're

1609
02:00:05,220 --> 02:00:09,300
fixing something that's not broken I don't know it it's not worth it to me

1610
02:00:09,300 --> 02:00:14,180
why would I pay for it again you know it was fine how it was before and you know

1611
02:00:14,180 --> 02:00:21,780
if I want 3d I'll just go into real I hear they have 3d in real they

1612
02:00:21,780 --> 02:00:27,460
apparently yes they do so I mean I don't know I'm just not down with the 3d I

1613
02:00:27,460 --> 02:00:31,180
still want a 3ds though you got it you got to check one out when they you know

1614
02:00:31,180 --> 02:00:34,860
I'll watch you play with now does it actually look like the stuffs coming out

1615
02:00:34,860 --> 02:00:38,980
of the screen no it's going into the going in the screen it's like looking

1616
02:00:38,980 --> 02:00:44,100
through a through a window into a three dimension imagine not like they're

1617
02:00:44,100 --> 02:00:51,740
looking for a real window at the naked woman in the window your description

1618
02:00:51,740 --> 02:00:57,580
of it makes me think of like the old head tracking thing with a wiimote hack

1619
02:00:57,580 --> 02:01:00,620
that's what it makes me think of well if you think about how the 3ds really works

1620
02:01:00,620 --> 02:01:04,260
with all the prisms and stuff basically sending a different image to each eye it

1621
02:01:04,260 --> 02:01:10,620
kind of makes sense how it looks when you see it I know but some of it here's

1622
02:01:10,620 --> 02:01:14,300
the thing but then some of the 3d effects what they do is they put the

1623
02:01:14,300 --> 02:01:20,060
main image on the very very back plane so that way when there's 3d effects it

1624
02:01:20,060 --> 02:01:23,420
does look like things are coming forward because they'll put the static image on

1625
02:01:23,420 --> 02:01:26,580
the very last plane in the very back and then things are shooting out like there

1626
02:01:26,580 --> 02:01:29,220
was one little demo they were showing out on the floor that was somebody

1627
02:01:29,220 --> 02:01:32,620
opening a champagne bottle in slow motion and the champagne goes everywhere

1628
02:01:32,620 --> 02:01:36,820
well it's just to show off the technology yeah like all I think of when

1629
02:01:36,820 --> 02:01:42,820
I think of that is just Nintendo saying we're Nintendo give me your money give

1630
02:01:42,820 --> 02:01:47,620
me your money people give them their money I know there's still one console

1631
02:01:47,620 --> 02:01:51,460
and I'm just worried that this one this gimmick fades like it will that the 3ds

1632
02:01:51,460 --> 02:01:54,540
I mean what's you know we you know you hope that would be around for a few

1633
02:01:54,540 --> 02:01:58,100
years but it's just gonna die every seven-year-old is going to want one

1634
02:01:58,100 --> 02:02:01,940
every single seven-year-old here's the thing though it doesn't matter that if

1635
02:02:01,940 --> 02:02:06,140
it if the 3d stuff fails because the other thing they can do is they can have

1636
02:02:06,140 --> 02:02:09,460
a nice because the top screen is like twice the resolution is the bottom

1637
02:02:09,460 --> 02:02:14,340
screen they can have a nice HD screen or they can also just use the extra

1638
02:02:14,340 --> 02:02:21,460
processing power to make really nice games well we'll see again a system is

1639
02:02:21,460 --> 02:02:24,020
only as good as the games that are on it and there are a lot of very promising

1640
02:02:24,020 --> 02:02:28,580
developers hopping in on it although again it's portable gaming and I'm not

1641
02:02:28,580 --> 02:02:32,460
always the biggest fan of portable games but if it can give me something that the

1642
02:02:32,460 --> 02:02:38,660
television games can't 3d in this case might be worth a look I don't know as if

1643
02:02:38,660 --> 02:02:41,820
it has really really really great games that necessitated I'm gonna have to go

1644
02:02:41,820 --> 02:02:47,260
well you can go ahead and spend your money I'm poor I'm just gonna have to go

1645
02:02:47,260 --> 02:02:56,100
buy a virtual boy you can only steal one oh my god that's a great idea no bad

1646
02:02:56,100 --> 02:03:01,100
idea never mind forget I said that all right let's go to the mailbag every week

1647
02:03:01,100 --> 02:03:05,260
you guys send us emails mailbag at orange lounge radio.com dark soccer is

1648
02:03:05,260 --> 02:03:09,460
gonna open up the email bag dive in headfirst try not to drowned under the

1649
02:03:09,460 --> 02:03:13,700
massive emails that are in there try not to inhale into the anthrax that comes

1650
02:03:13,700 --> 02:03:22,060
with the messages you read a few all right this one is from lab rat y2k I

1651
02:03:22,060 --> 02:03:25,580
just finished a journey into my own gaming vault this trip had me play

1652
02:03:25,580 --> 02:03:30,300
earthbound mother in Japan for the SNES for the first time it's like they read

1653
02:03:30,300 --> 02:03:34,840
rice princesses mind I know I can't speak highly enough of this game it had

1654
02:03:34,840 --> 02:03:38,740
a great story and I found that I actually cared about the NPCs additionally

1655
02:03:38,740 --> 02:03:42,380
I truly enjoyed the humor this is something that's been missing from most

1656
02:03:42,380 --> 02:03:46,580
of the recent JRPGs if you haven't covered this on your retro gaming

1657
02:03:46,580 --> 02:03:52,140
segment it would definitely be worth consideration lab rat y2k I concur

1658
02:03:52,140 --> 02:03:56,500
greeting well now if you don't play it all the way to the very very end where

1659
02:03:56,500 --> 02:03:59,500
you actually beat it then be careful because rice princess will make fun of

1660
02:03:59,500 --> 02:04:02,200
you for the rest of your life so you better play it to completion it's true

1661
02:04:02,200 --> 02:04:08,580
don't just play the first town like Rob did I played at least four towns are you

1662
02:04:08,580 --> 02:04:13,100
sure about that I had a full party of people like you don't get that until

1663
02:04:13,100 --> 02:04:19,700
like practically halfway through the game stop laughing at me bitch

1664
02:04:19,700 --> 02:04:25,620
greetings again from Rob above hi I have been hoping and waiting for Verizon to

1665
02:04:25,620 --> 02:04:29,100
get an iPhone contract because I'm shopping for a phone keep on waiting

1666
02:04:29,100 --> 02:04:33,420
let's imagine that if it became reality I have some pretty good reasons to

1667
02:04:33,420 --> 02:04:37,380
believe that apps that use the network for gaming or social networking will not

1668
02:04:37,380 --> 02:04:42,700
work between AT&T and Verizon the only ones that will are the ones that push

1669
02:04:42,700 --> 02:04:46,260
and pull things via the internet like Facebook or Twitter app I think this

1670
02:04:46,260 --> 02:04:48,820
will be an eye-opening disappointment I hope I'm wrong

1671
02:04:48,820 --> 02:04:55,140
imagine iPhones with babies from Rob above I know I'm not sure I follow the

1672
02:04:55,140 --> 02:05:00,740
logic there why they wouldn't work because of them using the networks the

1673
02:05:00,740 --> 02:05:05,140
time for networks I mean if the bandwidth is different than some network

1674
02:05:05,140 --> 02:05:08,700
or some apps might have problems like things like Netflix and so forth but I

1675
02:05:08,700 --> 02:05:12,020
would think that if a Verizon iPhone goes out of the marketplace the band was

1676
02:05:12,020 --> 02:05:15,180
only gonna get better because there's you know gonna be more of it available

1677
02:05:15,180 --> 02:05:18,540
there'll be a bunch of people that get off of AT&T's network that'll make it

1678
02:05:18,540 --> 02:05:21,420
easier for them and then there'll be people on Verizon's now where it's kind

1679
02:05:21,420 --> 02:05:26,940
of like you know spreading it out a little bit I don't know next email hey

1680
02:05:26,940 --> 02:05:32,100
hey with the plans versus zombies talk on last show it brings to focus my

1681
02:05:32,100 --> 02:05:35,820
addiction to the game on Steam looking over my playtime is almost depressing

1682
02:05:35,820 --> 02:05:41,140
portal two hours half-life 2 one of the best first-person shooters made 44

1683
02:05:41,140 --> 02:05:45,580
minutes team fortress 2 2 hours torchlight 8 hours plants versus zombies

1684
02:05:45,580 --> 02:05:50,340
game of the year edition 40 hours Wow hopefully I'll have the chance to give

1685
02:05:50,340 --> 02:05:53,880
the other games the playtime they deserve in the meantime I'm really

1686
02:05:53,880 --> 02:05:57,580
hoping that next year's plants versus zombies DS game will feature the

1687
02:05:57,580 --> 02:06:03,620
multiplayer elements of the 360 release keep us big keep podcasting and stay

1688
02:06:03,620 --> 02:06:07,740
something Robert M it's like the listeners are reading our minds this

1689
02:06:07,740 --> 02:06:10,700
week with the whole like plants versus zombies like everybody's talking about

1690
02:06:10,700 --> 02:06:13,100
how they've been playing that even though that game is a good year or two

1691
02:06:13,100 --> 02:06:19,420
old at this point it's cuz you're psychic Rob shut up no no no okay

1692
02:06:19,420 --> 02:06:23,380
greetings all our it's your favorite your friendly neighborhood turtle here I

1693
02:06:23,380 --> 02:06:26,980
just wanted to thank you so much for the marathon show actually listen to the

1694
02:06:26,980 --> 02:06:32,700
entire podcast in one long day of work I was worn out after that anywho I think

1695
02:06:32,700 --> 02:06:37,660
the idea of Blizzcon is stupid but is anyone besides me pulling out their hair

1696
02:06:37,660 --> 02:06:42,300
while waiting for any news about Diablo 3 back in the day of Diablo 2 I never

1697
02:06:42,300 --> 02:06:47,700
used any form of voiceover IP and still spent hundreds of hours playing it I

1698
02:06:47,700 --> 02:06:52,740
can't imagine the addiction this time around keep up the great work on the

1699
02:06:52,740 --> 02:06:56,820
best structured most informational and best podcast running on the internet to

1700
02:06:56,820 --> 02:07:04,260
your local your loyal turtle in Philly serious turtle a serious turtle yes

1701
02:07:04,260 --> 02:07:07,500
serious turtle I have been pulling my hair out over Diablo 3 in fact I've

1702
02:07:07,500 --> 02:07:12,860
pulled out a whole little clump in the back in a nice little circle but I am

1703
02:07:12,860 --> 02:07:17,820
I'm actually really excited about Diablo 3 all things considered it's it's been

1704
02:07:17,820 --> 02:07:22,100
way too long since the first game World of Warcraft honestly feels like more

1705
02:07:22,100 --> 02:07:25,660
like World of Diablo to me in the way it plays it's just in the Warcraft

1706
02:07:25,660 --> 02:07:30,980
mythology so I'm I'm I'm very excited about Diablo 3 and I think I brought

1707
02:07:30,980 --> 02:07:33,020
this up on the show before I think there's definitely when it comes to

1708
02:07:33,020 --> 02:07:36,260
Blizzard two different camps there's the Starcraft people and there's a Diablo

1709
02:07:36,260 --> 02:07:40,940
people and not a lot of crossover I appreciate Starcraft I bought it it's

1710
02:07:40,940 --> 02:07:44,820
fun I see why people like it but I didn't really play it to completion

1711
02:07:44,820 --> 02:07:48,700
because I never play games completion anymore let's face it but Diablo 3 oh

1712
02:07:48,700 --> 02:07:59,060
it's on because you're not Korean yes it's because I'm not Korean no I'm

1713
02:07:59,060 --> 02:08:04,420
reading anyway dear olr I was listening to Loki's failtastic Apple metaphor and

1714
02:08:04,420 --> 02:08:08,620
thought I'd take a crack at it so I want to take me and a bunch of my friends out

1715
02:08:08,620 --> 02:08:12,380
to a restaurant I could just get takeout and have a party at home but I like the

1716
02:08:12,380 --> 02:08:15,860
experience that comes with dining out also I don't want my house getting

1717
02:08:15,860 --> 02:08:19,860
trashed so I treat my friends to dinner at a semi-fine restaurant paying for the

1718
02:08:19,860 --> 02:08:23,340
entire meal because I'm a nerd with a full-time job the restaurant presumably

1719
02:08:23,340 --> 02:08:26,900
includes the cost of the dining experience waiters dishes silverware bad

1720
02:08:26,900 --> 02:08:31,500
music random crap on the walls etc in with the cost of the meal because if

1721
02:08:31,500 --> 02:08:34,780
people saw what this actually cost they might not choose to enjoy the dining

1722
02:08:34,780 --> 02:08:39,820
experience this cost comes to me because I'm the one paying however if the

1723
02:08:39,820 --> 02:08:42,780
restaurant is an establishment that makes each individual person pay for

1724
02:08:42,780 --> 02:08:46,620
their own dining experience and I'm not going to stand out in front of a

1725
02:08:46,620 --> 02:08:51,260
restaurant yell fuck you and fuck your fucking dining fee instead I will give

1726
02:08:51,260 --> 02:08:54,140
my business to different restaurant that doesn't charge outrageous dining fees

1727
02:08:54,140 --> 02:08:58,340
that ladies and gentlemen is how to craft a metaphor stay black

1728
02:08:58,340 --> 02:09:02,980
entertainment this message is brought to you by 2x plus 2y minus 8 equals 4y

1729
02:09:02,980 --> 02:09:11,300
solve for X the answer by the way is X equals 4y minus y plus 4 sorry you

1730
02:09:11,300 --> 02:09:15,940
weren't here when that happened Danja we had a caller on the show and Dan was

open at 1877 game olr or our username on skype is orange launcher do but not yet

1767
02:13:05,780 --> 02:13:10,180
because we have two more stories to go look yeah yes um I told people to get

1768
02:13:10,180 --> 02:13:13,800
their dialing fingers ready they're dialing fingers it's like playing flame

1769
02:13:13,800 --> 02:13:25,100
and finger I'm waiting Microsoft getting a taste of money because of halo reach

1770
02:13:25,100 --> 02:13:30,020
has decided you know what maybe one halo game every three years not frequent

1771
02:13:30,020 --> 02:13:36,060
enough we need to be putting out more halo games and they're saying you know

1772
02:13:36,060 --> 02:13:42,900
probably I guess Phil Spencer this is Microsoft's VP they're saying it's a

1773
02:13:42,900 --> 02:13:47,140
matter of keeping players engaged and not going dark for two years at a time

1774
02:13:47,140 --> 02:13:51,980
they want to do what Activision has done with Call of Duty which is whore that

1775
02:13:51,980 --> 02:13:58,880
bitch out like no other and they said I used to look at annual releases of non

1776
02:13:58,880 --> 02:14:04,460
sports games as people just like just trying to milk me I figured nobody had

1777
02:14:04,460 --> 02:14:07,940
enough time to do a good job and all the negatives that would associate with

1778
02:14:07,940 --> 02:14:11,780
those kinds of scenarios kudos Activision because they've done a good

1779
02:14:11,780 --> 02:14:17,740
job putting good game continuing to release each year I think the fans like

1780
02:14:17,740 --> 02:14:23,620
it and it's a good thing that they do it that way that's because they had two

1781
02:14:23,620 --> 02:14:28,700
different developers working on it I don't know if that's gonna work with

1782
02:14:28,700 --> 02:14:34,380
halo do you think that halo is just gonna go really downhill now that a

1783
02:14:34,380 --> 02:14:38,500
different studios gonna be developing it oh yeah I mean especially if it sounds

1784
02:14:38,500 --> 02:14:41,060
like they're gonna try to crank them out as fast as possible that sounds

1785
02:14:41,060 --> 02:14:45,860
dangerous just do not put roughing games on halo because they really fucked up

1786
02:14:45,860 --> 02:14:52,820
crackdown too um do you think they're gonna try and crank out a halo game

1787
02:14:52,820 --> 02:14:56,900
again as early as next year that because if that's the case and somebody's

1788
02:14:56,900 --> 02:15:02,700
already working on it I don't know we'll have to see I it's just gonna get to the

1789
02:15:02,700 --> 02:15:07,180
point though see with Call of Duty even you know the modern warfare was really

1790
02:15:07,180 --> 02:15:12,460
awesome and then modern warfare 2 was still very awesome and world at war that

1791
02:15:12,460 --> 02:15:16,420
came out in between that was just kind of like it's alright but still people

1792
02:15:16,420 --> 02:15:20,660
went and played the one game so people aren't necessarily buying every year's

1793
02:15:20,660 --> 02:15:24,820
you know iteration of the game and that's also another thing that's really

1794
02:15:24,820 --> 02:15:27,660
hard to do it when you're putting a really good multiplayer game is like

1795
02:15:27,660 --> 02:15:32,300
halo reach for example people will be playing halo region till the next halo

1796
02:15:32,300 --> 02:15:36,980
game comes out but if it keeps coming out each year and if like some of them

1797
02:15:36,980 --> 02:15:43,500
happen to suck or maybe are made by Treyarch then people might not give a

1798
02:15:43,500 --> 02:15:50,220
shit anymore I just you know I hope they don't take a respectable name and really

1799
02:15:50,220 --> 02:15:55,860
drive it into the ground but then again fresh blood isn't always a bad thing it

1800
02:15:55,860 --> 02:15:59,660
could be cool just most of the time it could be cool but the thing is like

1801
02:15:59,660 --> 02:16:06,460
Microsoft they need more franchises seein you know fables a great game I

1802
02:16:06,460 --> 02:16:16,420
guess I fucking hate peeler Molinos so much why he's such a prick seriously our

1803
02:16:16,420 --> 02:16:19,980
game is so awesome it does all these things other games don't do you're gonna

1804
02:16:19,980 --> 02:16:24,860
really care for this dog really I cared so much I stopped playing months ago

1805
02:16:24,860 --> 02:16:30,540
this dog's gonna come your life no he's annoying he's like hey dig here there's

1806
02:16:30,540 --> 02:16:34,860
treasure here dig here dig here dig here there's treasure here you can raise your

1807
02:16:34,860 --> 02:16:39,700
family and it's so wonderful this time you're gonna be able to be the king or

1808
02:16:39,700 --> 02:16:43,340
queen of your kingdom you have to run it and things are gonna happen you're gonna

1809
02:16:43,340 --> 02:16:48,380
have your dog still because everybody loves dog and and it's really amazing

1810
02:16:48,380 --> 02:16:53,540
and we're gonna do this project Milo shit that's gonna be so wonderful you're

1811
02:16:53,540 --> 02:16:57,500
gonna interact with this kid like you're interacting with a real kid don't play

1812
02:16:57,500 --> 02:17:00,460
with your kids your kids can interact with this kid just like you're

1813
02:17:00,460 --> 02:17:07,900
interacting with real friends because they don't have real friends oh he's

1814
02:17:07,900 --> 02:17:14,580
just so annoying with his leg new technology and shit and I'm sorry like

1815
02:17:14,580 --> 02:17:18,580
here's the thing he comes out saying that these games are gonna be so much

1816
02:17:18,580 --> 02:17:23,500
more incredible than the last game because of all these reasons and they're

1817
02:17:23,500 --> 02:17:27,980
like nearly identical to the last year's release it's like what happened all this

1818
02:17:27,980 --> 02:17:30,580
innovation that you're gonna put in there because this game is kind of

1819
02:17:30,580 --> 02:17:34,700
terrible well no and why don't we go back to the original scrap Milo because

1820
02:17:34,700 --> 02:17:39,140
yeah that's stupid and creepy and we can do we can do the we'll get an adult guy

1821
02:17:39,140 --> 02:17:43,780
an adult woman and then integrate porn into the games I'm glad that they were

1822
02:17:43,780 --> 02:17:46,900
able to show off this wonderful tech demo where they can interact with a

1823
02:17:46,900 --> 02:17:51,540
child and stuff but like if you actually heard about what the game was supposed

1824
02:17:51,540 --> 02:17:56,060
to be about it was stupid it was just like oh you interact with this child and

1825
02:17:56,060 --> 02:18:00,340
if you help them find snails because he's moved here from it from isn't that

1826
02:18:00,340 --> 02:18:05,260
connect animals no no no they make my little okay it's not connect to humans

1827
02:18:05,260 --> 02:18:10,980
okay it's a child it's a real boy like Pinocchio he wants to be a real boy but

1828
02:18:10,980 --> 02:18:16,260
he's just digital and you interact with him he helped by snails because he's

1829
02:18:16,260 --> 02:18:20,900
just so depressed from flying here from I think he was coming from Britain or

1830
02:18:20,900 --> 02:18:24,140
something like that and somewhere in England flying from England doesn't know

1831
02:18:24,140 --> 02:18:29,660
anybody and his parents are going through some hard times maybe divorce or

1832
02:18:29,660 --> 02:18:35,500
something and that's this is way more anger than I was anticipating your Jeff

1833
02:18:35,500 --> 02:18:39,580
Goldblum voice is just no it's is it's the Peter molyneaux voice that's how he

1834
02:18:39,580 --> 02:18:43,340

1836
02:18:48,020 --> 02:18:52,020
project it's a Peter molyneaux accident oh he talked dark Tetsuya says well I

1837
02:18:52,020 --> 02:18:56,100
think Loki's British accent beats Rob's I'm not trying to sound British I'm

1838

alright can I do one more story that we can open up the skyline sure alright

1859
02:21:14,980 --> 02:21:19,820
Nintendo will sue at least that's what they've been doing this week threatening

1860
02:21:19,820 --> 02:21:24,100
to do they've been threatening Pokemon fan sites who have been posting Pokemon

1861
02:21:24,100 --> 02:21:27,940
black and white screenshots the game came out in Japan and of course you

1862
02:21:27,940 --> 02:21:31,060
know folks have been importing it and have been posting screenshots of it on

1863
02:21:31,060 --> 02:21:35,540
their fan sites but Nintendo has brought down the legal hammer of justice with a

1864
02:21:35,540 --> 02:21:38,860
cease and desist saying quote while Nintendo appreciates your interest in

1865
02:21:38,860 --> 02:21:41,940
and support of the Pokemon game series your publication of this content

1866
02:21:41,940 --> 02:21:45,500
infringes Nintendo's copyrights in violation of federal law your activity

1867
02:21:45,500 --> 02:21:48,780
also and has the potential caught to cause substantial damage to Nintendo and

1868
02:21:48,780 --> 02:21:51,980
leaves Nintendo with no choice but to take steps to protect its intellectual

1869
02:21:51,980 --> 02:21:57,220
property rights some of the sites that were hit poker beach pokey beach I don't

1870
02:21:57,220 --> 02:22:03,660
know and your beach poker be check up your Pokemon sorry be I don't know if

1871
02:22:03,660 --> 02:22:06,940
that's one of the names of the Pokemon is Siri be or something and of course

1872
02:22:06,940 --> 02:22:11,060
they're very upset no and this is awesome because Nintendo is so epically

1873
02:22:11,060 --> 02:22:14,900
horrible at advertising their own stuff now yes they're going to get pissed off

1874
02:22:14,900 --> 02:22:18,180
apparently when other people actually try to advertise for them like that's

1875
02:22:18,180 --> 02:22:21,580
that's amazing it's also kind of disturbing to me that it's like well the

1876
02:22:21,580 --> 02:22:25,420
game's out somewhere but hold on because there was an update that came out to

1877
02:22:25,420 --> 02:22:29,380
this that might kind of shed a little light on it and it was you know some

1878
02:22:29,380 --> 02:22:33,100
various commenters on websites were kind of noticing that the sites that got shut

1879
02:22:33,100 --> 02:22:40,340
down were admitting to using ROMs to get the screens so maybe the problem wasn't

1880
02:22:40,340 --> 02:22:43,820
that they were posting screenshots but it's admitting how they did it by

1881
02:22:43,820 --> 02:22:48,620
getting ROMs of an import game I mean still screenshots are just screenshots

1882
02:22:48,620 --> 02:22:51,820
and the game is already out but you know if you're gonna go around openly saying

1883
02:22:51,820 --> 02:22:56,740
I stole the game what if I said you know I wished upon a magic lamp and the gene

1884
02:22:56,740 --> 02:23:00,980
granted me this copy of the game are they gonna shut down my Pokemon site

1885
02:23:00,980 --> 02:23:05,740
now well then maybe I don't know I mean I could say that it fell from the sky

1886
02:23:05,740 --> 02:23:10,380
in a blaze of glory or you just don't say how you got the screenshots at all

1887
02:23:10,380 --> 02:23:13,900
you just post them I mean isn't that what most websites do but Rob that would

1888
02:23:13,900 --> 02:23:18,780
be like they get their exclusive report we got the exclusive photoshop those

1889
02:23:18,780 --> 02:23:22,940
those are photoshop I don't believe that Pokemon has that in there also keep in

02:32:34,380 --> 02:32:40,380
okay good stuff I think this is gonna have to happen what do you think Rama

1992
02:32:40,380 --> 02:32:43,500
you have to get on stage to see in front of hundreds of people know it what's

1993
02:32:43,500 --> 02:32:48,180
that I said I'm all for it awesome awesome I have to get over my stage

1994
02:32:48,180 --> 02:32:52,860
right now you'll be fine just put a paper bag on your head and cut out little

1995
02:32:52,860 --> 02:32:58,380
like like like in um um guitar hero you can do on guitar freakin um put a

1996
02:32:58,380 --> 02:33:04,300
bucket of chicken thing on your head it's hard like bucket head there you go

1997
02:33:04,300 --> 02:33:09,700
no I'm talking I was you know like the little icon guys from guitar freaks

1998
02:33:09,700 --> 02:33:14,740
you know that game that was made by that could be our band name guitar freaks was

1999
02:33:14,740 --> 02:33:20,380
first well if you want I give you permission to use my band name what's

2000
02:33:20,380 --> 02:33:36,540
that rhythm in Jews Rama Jews have no rhythm come on come on I tease because

2001
02:33:36,540 --> 02:33:41,940
I suggested that I could play with one arm like the drummer for a definitely

2002
02:33:41,940 --> 02:33:44,940
actually that's an amazing idea because what you should do you should do that

2003
02:33:44,940 --> 02:33:46,900
whole thing where you put your hand through your shirt so it looks like you

2004
02:33:46,900 --> 02:33:52,020
don't have an arm awesome because he has a floor pad maybe we can put it on the

2005
02:33:52,020 --> 02:33:55,340
floor and I can hit it with my feet only if you only if you kick your legs back

2006
02:33:55,340 --> 02:33:58,540
in a wheelchair it's not like your lieutenant Dan it's it's Halloween time

2007
02:33:58,540 --> 02:34:02,540
so he she could we go to a Halloween store and get you one of those fake

2008
02:34:02,540 --> 02:34:11,660
arms always been lobbed off I'll be awesome that's okay it was a good idea

2009
02:34:11,660 --> 02:34:15,780
at the time I know right we'll just get dark soccer good and drunk before she

2010
02:34:15,780 --> 02:34:19,820
goes on stage alright drunk I won't be able to say why do I get a drug just

2011
02:34:19,820 --> 02:34:23,660
bribe her with Guinness that here's the best part guys this doesn't get me they

2012
02:34:23,660 --> 02:34:30,660
stream loud on the internet so all of you could watch never mind I'll get the

2013
02:34:30,660 --> 02:34:36,340
recorder ready and it'll be good act F suggests instrument freaks or band

2014
02:34:36,340 --> 02:34:42,100
freaks which is facts maniacs which is great because there's people from

2015
02:34:42,100 --> 02:34:45,860
harmonics that actually go to the event and it would be extremely offensive if

2016
02:34:45,860 --> 02:34:48,020
we named although I don't know if any people are harmonious is they're

2017
02:34:48,020 --> 02:34:53,140
wonderful people but it would be funny could be freaky guitarists we could be

2018
02:34:53,140 --> 02:35:03,060
the five seven threes we know we could be the Spice Girls we could dress up as

2019
02:35:03,060 --> 02:35:07,620
Spice Girls more like the shy girls I get to be Jerry that's all all right

vamos hablar el verbo kami nar kami nar kami nar to walk yo kami no tu kami nace

2049
02:37:34,860 --> 02:37:39,220
el kami nay it was dead Tom B and I still remember this song to this day is

2050
02:37:39,220 --> 02:37:44,940
pathetic French horrible what did you think didn't have any song what did you

2051
02:37:44,940 --> 02:37:51,060
think of the verb conjugation song wasn't it awesome oh yeah all right so

2052
02:37:51,060 --> 02:37:55,820
speaking of video games what's up in video game world yeah video games so

2053
02:37:55,820 --> 02:38:01,860
interesting oh I wanted to talk about a story to talk about last week about a

2054
02:38:01,860 --> 02:38:09,140
certain video game side that sells all games ah yes that site that went up and

2055
02:38:09,140 --> 02:38:13,340
down and then up again oh I think they're still down though because we're

2056
02:38:13,340 --> 02:38:20,180
definitely not covering the story that they came back I'm aware that they're

2057
02:38:20,180 --> 02:38:24,740
still down there went my final story of the night oh what would you want to say

2058
02:38:24,740 --> 02:38:29,900
about the site that shall not be named well not necessarily about the site but

2059
02:38:29,900 --> 02:38:37,620
about like steam and other sites like I don't remember the other right direct to

2060
02:38:37,620 --> 02:38:47,780
drive also that sell games the digital distribution distribution well I'm you

2061
02:38:47,780 --> 02:38:50,380
know it has a lot of people kind of thinking about digital distribution with

2062
02:38:50,380 --> 02:38:53,540
the website going down it's kind of like a lot of people were giving it second

2063
02:38:53,540 --> 02:38:57,340
thought like gee is one day all my games just going to suddenly stop working now

2064
02:38:57,340 --> 02:39:03,540
to be fair I believe the games that the website got me with a pitchfork was

2065
02:39:03,540 --> 02:39:09,700
selling they were DRM free right and then steam has always said if they ever

2066
02:39:09,700 --> 02:39:14,060
go down they do have this magic key that will unlock the DRM and all the games

2067
02:39:14,060 --> 02:39:17,740
and they have like a panic button they can hit they'll automatically make all

2068
02:39:17,740 --> 02:39:20,620
the games DRM free and I'm surprised hackers haven't found it yet but it must

2069
02:39:20,620 --> 02:39:24,620
be I think they might have it must be a patch or something I don't know but you

2070
02:39:24,620 --> 02:39:32,460
know they there is a way out but yeah it's kind of worrying because I have a

2071
02:39:32,460 --> 02:39:39,140
lot of games I have bought and given to me on steam so I kind of I kind of worry

2072
02:39:39,140 --> 02:39:44,780
about that where I think it's going to be down someday I think you'll be okay

2073
02:39:44,780 --> 02:39:48,620
if you read the terms of service for steam it sounds like you'll be okay now

2074
02:39:48,620 --> 02:39:51,500
here's the one you would worry about honestly if I were you was be that on

2075
02:39:51,500 --> 02:39:55,580
live as neat as that service is and this scale cool as it looks at the whole

2076
02:39:55,580 --> 02:39:58,900
streaming game through the internet or whatever when you buy those games you're

2077
02:39:58,900 --> 02:40:01,900
basically buying the game on someone else's computer and if that service ever

2078
02:40:01,900 --> 02:40:07,100
goes down you're gonna lose that game now I think they've excuse me they've

2079
02:40:07,100 --> 02:40:12,340
guaranteed it for what like three years I think but that's you know after that

2080
02:40:12,340 --> 02:40:15,060
three years you may not have the game anymore which you know after three years

2081
02:40:15,060 --> 02:40:17,700
you may not want to play the game anymore but I don't know there's some

2082
02:40:17,700 --> 02:40:20,980
games I want to go back and visit after a long time like the very first

2083
02:40:20,980 --> 02:40:25,300
civilization I could still play that game it's great and no I didn't place it

2084
02:40:25,300 --> 02:40:33,780
five this week I'm a bad sieve fan anyhow well good thing on live it's it's

2085
02:40:33,780 --> 02:40:37,980

2086
02:40:37,980 --> 02:40:44,940
hopefully someday as always get last in line I'm sorry yeah all right well any

online with the doctor what's up hey this is entertainment hey what's up

2101
02:41:45,100 --> 02:41:50,540
what's on your mind I want to bitch about PSN for a second okay right on

2102
02:41:50,540 --> 02:41:56,460
well I got move and I downloaded a couple demos because I didn't get the

2103
02:41:56,460 --> 02:42:05,540
$99 package with the demo disk in it okay so I I set this up to download

2104
02:42:05,540 --> 02:42:10,700
overnight and usually I can go to work or set stuff to download overnight on

2105
02:42:10,700 --> 02:42:18,260
live and it'll be done when I wake up or get home so I wake up and the thing is

2106
02:42:18,260 --> 02:42:26,340
and my PlayStation 3 is still on I'm serious it's still trying to download well

2107
02:42:26,340 --> 02:42:31,940
no it downloaded overnight but it took at least eight hours because I went to

2108
02:42:31,940 --> 02:42:37,540
sleep about 2 a.m. and left to go see a movie at about 11 and it was still on oh

2109
02:42:37,540 --> 02:42:42,540
wait what was it you were trying to download just the the patch or seven

2110
02:42:42,540 --> 02:42:48,020
seven demos for move Wow and none of them were any bigger than about three

2111
02:42:48,020 --> 02:42:52,300
hundred fifty max it wasn't the same no it wasn't the same day the network went

2112
02:42:52,300 --> 02:42:55,700
down right it's just it maybe they were just getting hammered I don't know that's

2113
02:42:55,700 --> 02:43:00,860
so it's kind of freaky you know you can buy full games on PSN can she has like

2114
02:43:00,860 --> 02:43:04,620
gigs and gigs of data that would just take you hours like you could just go

2115
02:43:04,620 --> 02:43:09,460
out the door drive to the mall downtown and back in less time than it would take

2116
02:43:09,460 --> 02:43:13,660
for the stupid game to download digital distribution might not really be the

2117
02:43:13,660 --> 02:43:17,680
wave of the future just yet it works for the smaller games like on Xbox Live

2118
02:43:17,680 --> 02:43:22,180
Arcade and you know some of the smaller PSN games but that's crazy I imagine

2119
02:43:22,180 --> 02:43:25,380
just a bunch of people were hitting it all at once but it's kind of surprising

2120
02:43:25,380 --> 02:43:29,420
they don't have a better backup system you know for that well a lot of people

2121
02:43:29,420 --> 02:43:34,780
must be trying to download the heavy rain move patch now because I triggered

2122
02:43:34,780 --> 02:43:41,940
it to download at about 9 o'clock which is 8 Pacific and it's been about an hour

2123
02:43:41,940 --> 02:43:49,860
and it says it's 16% complete and it will take 324 minutes left oh that's

2124
02:43:49,860 --> 02:43:53,900
ridiculous do you have points running I mean maybe your porn torrents are

2125
02:43:53,900 --> 02:43:57,460
clogging everything that could be the job no the only thing I'm doing right

2126
02:43:57,460 --> 02:44:03,780
now is I'm calling you on my iPad huh and that's it this is pretty good

2127
02:44:03,780 --> 02:44:11,220
quality for an iPad I must say huh well I I don't know sir I you could call Sony

2128
02:44:11,220 --> 02:44:13,900
and complain or you could just bitch about it on internet forums like you're

2129
02:44:13,900 --> 02:44:19,420
doing now yeah most people are going to be doing I mean what can you do the

2130
02:44:19,420 --> 02:44:23,380
internet is for yeah exactly it's for bitching anonymously on internet forums

2131
02:44:23,380 --> 02:44:27,780
about your products yeah anything else you want to complain about while you're

2132
02:44:27,780 --> 02:44:34,500
on no I was I did finally play some of the demos and they're really good the

2133
02:44:34,500 --> 02:44:40,540
tumble demo is really nice mm-hmm and so is ruse which is kind of what I've

2134
02:44:40,540 --> 02:44:47,140
always wanted from wiimote from out of the week do you think it's do you think

2135
02:44:47,140 --> 02:44:53,380
that this the PlayStation might have a serious competitor here to the Wii I

2136
02:44:53,380 --> 02:44:58,900
don't know it all depends on the games right right but it sounds like you were

2137

on like a Dave Matthews band CD and put on a visor sideways like a great visual

2154
02:46:24,780 --> 02:46:30,200
yeah keep talking keep talking I was calling about Ronda's comment that mad

2155
02:46:30,200 --> 02:46:34,420
cats really just needs to stop making controllers okay I have a little story

2156
02:46:34,420 --> 02:46:39,380
about that awesome I used I bought one of their like eight

2157
02:46:39,380 --> 02:46:44,780
and one memory sticks for the Dreamcast where it has a switch on it it died

2158
02:46:44,780 --> 02:46:48,780
after like a month it deleted all my saves no I love that it not only died

2159
02:46:48,780 --> 02:46:53,220
but it deleted them that's that's amazing yeah and then since he was

2160
02:46:53,220 --> 02:47:00,180
talking about controllers I bought a Blanca six button the fighting pad for

2161
02:47:00,180 --> 02:47:05,580
the 360 when Street Fighter 4 came out and I got it off I think eBay it was

2162
02:47:05,580 --> 02:47:08,740
brand new it was in like the horrible clamshell where you need like a box

2163
02:47:08,740 --> 02:47:13,660
cutter and a living sacrifice to get the fuck it's open and meanwhile you break

2164
02:47:13,660 --> 02:47:17,540
the product is you're opening yeah yeah it didn't work like it was just dead out

2165
02:47:17,540 --> 02:47:21,320
of the box the 360 was like I don't know what the fuck you just connected to me

2166
02:47:21,320 --> 02:47:25,860
but this is doubt it get that get this away from me so I said like 40 bucks on

2167
02:47:25,860 --> 02:47:30,220
a mad cat's controller that was just dead like that's awesome so they need to

2168
02:47:30,220 --> 02:47:36,100
stop very good yeah I agree with all those stories I would probably buy one

2169
02:47:36,100 --> 02:47:42,920
just to you know step on it and kick the grass room I can hear Rob giggling hi hi

2170
02:47:42,920 --> 02:47:49,020
feel better fine also since you guys are talking about the Tomb Raider reboot I

2171
02:47:49,020 --> 02:47:52,980
really think that no one Kerr about Lara Croft anymore and that they need to put

2172
02:47:52,980 --> 02:47:56,700
that franchise to bed because there are so many bad games associated with that

2173
02:47:56,700 --> 02:48:00,940
hold on you enjoyed that Lara Croft in the guardian light game as much as I did

2174
02:48:00,940 --> 02:48:05,180
unless you were lying for my benefit no see that's the thing that's an awesome

2175
02:48:05,180 --> 02:48:10,180
game no it is but because it has Lara Croft and Tomb Raider attached to it

2176
02:48:10,180 --> 02:48:14,100
like that's the brand people are gonna go oh you know what's this shit and

2177
02:48:14,100 --> 02:48:18,500
they're not gonna buy it I think that's what if if that co-op game was put under

2178
02:48:18,500 --> 02:48:22,180
a new IP with new characters people would go oh this is a great game because

2179
02:48:22,180 --> 02:48:27,900
it is but just the Tomb Raider games for the ps2 were awful three four five for

2180
02:48:27,900 --> 02:48:34,100
the ps1 were awful so I just feel that this kind of box office poison like I

2181
02:48:34,100 --> 02:48:37,980
don't know she's Lara Croft is Lara Croft is the M night Shyamalan of video

2182
02:48:37,980 --> 02:48:42,060
games you pretty much like they just they don't care you know she was genre

2183
02:48:42,060 --> 02:48:47,420
breaking in 96 with her you know platforming and her bad pyramid tips but

2184
02:48:47,420 --> 02:48:53,700
now no one cares no wonder no one care about Lara Croft which is which is a

2185
02:48:53,700 --> 02:48:57,260
shame because I think that you know I'd often still put out good games with her

2186
02:48:57,260 --> 02:49:01,660
it's just that she as an icon is bringing their ideas down I don't know

2187
02:49:01,660 --> 02:49:06,740
do you think maybe they got one more chance like maybe this reboot if it's

2188
02:49:06,740 --> 02:49:11,140
really good maybe people can look past it and forgive or no it's over put it

2189
02:49:11,140 --> 02:49:15,140
pasture didn't I thought the game the adventure game that they put out for her

2190
02:49:15,140 --> 02:49:19,500
last year or the year before I think it's for the ps3 was also supposed to

2191
02:49:19,500 --> 02:49:23,900
be really good but like again I've never really heard of that like once it came

2192
02:49:23,900 --> 02:49:29,000
out no one cared and it never really broke any sales charts so I think it may

2193
02:49:29,000 --> 02:49:32,220
just be a done deal I guess with the reboot if they'd have to put a lot of

2194
02:49:32,220 --> 02:49:36,060
money into marketing it to say like no really guys this was actually good or

2195
02:49:36,060 --> 02:49:40,540
just put the topless patch in honestly and then boys everywhere want to play

2196
02:49:40,540 --> 02:49:44,340
right just just release it on PC in the skidding community will take care of

2197
02:49:44,340 --> 02:49:48,060
that for them there you go all right anything else you want to share with the

2198
02:49:48,060 --> 02:49:53,700
listeners nope that's it I managed to stave off having a coffee fit for a good

2199
02:49:53,700 --> 02:49:57,540
two minutes so I think now's a good time to leave okay feel better better get

2212
02:50:58,660 --> 02:51:06,140
hey what's up suppose what's that I'm on with the doctor you're on with the

2213
02:51:06,140 --> 02:51:09,940
doctor I'm the doctor is there any aliens I need to be worrying about them

2214
02:51:09,940 --> 02:51:13,540
ah there's tons of aliens dude I got my son a screwdriver and I'm ready to go

2215
02:51:13,540 --> 02:51:19,940
oh shit I gotta run we better because there is an awful lot of running so we

2216
02:51:19,940 --> 02:51:27,100
definitely need to do that so besides the aliens what's going on tonight with

2217
02:51:27,100 --> 02:51:32,020
you wait who is that hi who is this this is zappy hi zappy how are you

2218
02:51:32,020 --> 02:51:36,740
I'm pretty good okay I'll let's talk to doctor yet okay well the reason was

2219
02:51:36,740 --> 02:51:40,260
talking good call in was because it's sort of related to what rare team was

2220
02:51:40,260 --> 02:51:46,140
talking about before is because I have a copy of ruse but for the Xbox 360 and

2221
02:51:46,140 --> 02:51:53,580
let me tell you that controller is in isn't cutting it like it's I can see

2222
02:51:53,580 --> 02:51:58,140
it's a really good game but you're just being held back by the horrible horrible

2223
02:51:58,140 --> 02:52:06,460
controls like I select my units and always picking the wrong ones and it's

2224
02:52:06,460 --> 02:52:10,340
just not working I could see that because that's a lot of games in game

2225
02:52:10,340 --> 02:52:15,260
room are kind of like that a lot of Street Fighter 4 on the Xbox 360 kind of

2226
02:52:15,260 --> 02:52:19,980
made me think that because it was just so awful to try and control but it's

2227
02:52:19,980 --> 02:52:24,820
kind of a bummer that that controller really ruins some games and what pisses

2228
02:52:24,820 --> 02:52:28,300
me off is because I didn't know that they're gonna have a PlayStation move

2229
02:52:28,300 --> 02:52:32,220
and that would probably work a lot better than trying to you know it's

2230
02:52:32,220 --> 02:52:37,100
basically like having a big anchor and being thrown off the side of the boat

2231
02:52:37,100 --> 02:52:41,860
you're kind of being dragged down to the bottom the ocean there well now what do

2232
02:52:41,860 --> 02:52:44,180
you think though about this new Xbox 360 controller they're supposed to be

2233
02:52:44,180 --> 02:52:47,380
putting out that has the whole like yeah you just twist it and then it's like a

2234
02:52:47,380 --> 02:52:53,020
different d-pad it looks like a big gimmick to charge me $65 isn't that

2235
02:52:53,020 --> 02:52:56,220
terrible that they're only bound bundling it with that dumb play in

2236
02:52:56,220 --> 02:53:00,860
charge or whatever it is like oh it's so annoying how they do this just like it's

2237
02:53:00,860 --> 02:53:06,000
just like Nintendo doing that new Nintendo remote with Wii Plus or

2238
02:53:06,000 --> 02:53:11,500
whatever with a crappy tennis knockoff game I mean really that's yeah but at

2239
02:53:11,500 --> 02:53:17,500
least the Wii Sports Resort was at least you know fun that's true I don't know I

2240
02:53:17,500 --> 02:53:20,060
didn't play a lot of that very seriously because I kind of gave up on the way I

2241
02:53:20,060 --> 02:53:23,540
haven't had my Wii plugged in and like over a year which is really sad because

2242
02:53:23,540 --> 02:53:27,180
I wanted to play Metroid but I just I can't bring myself to hook up the new

2243
02:53:27,180 --> 02:53:33,620
Nintendo Wii. God dammit you're lazy. Somewhere deep in Nintendo America's headquarters, Reggie is amazed crying himself to sleep after that.

2244
02:53:33,620 --> 02:53:37,420
but the problem is like I have heard nothing but bad things about the new

2245
02:53:37,420 --> 02:53:40,100
Metroid and it's making me a little weird well I've heard a few good things

2246
02:53:40,100 --> 02:53:43,660
here and there but I'm a little scared because like Super Metroid is like the

2247
02:53:43,660 --> 02:53:48,460
Holy Grail of video games to me and oh yeah I love Super Metroid and if they

2248
02:53:48,460 --> 02:53:54,100
botched it like I'm I'm really really sad like my experience with new Metroid

2249
02:53:54,100 --> 02:54:00,040
was about five minutes at Best Buy and it seemed okay but I have five minutes I

2250
02:54:00,040 --> 02:54:05,180
can't really say here or there could be good just wouldn't kind of made me

2251
02:54:05,180 --> 02:54:09,420
honest yeah you can't base an entire review of a game off of just five

2252
02:54:09,420 --> 02:54:13,460
minutes you know cuz I'm sure everybody at E3 loved it you know the lines to play

2253
02:54:13,460 --> 02:54:18,140
that game at E3 were like hours long it was almost as long as the 3ds line at

2254
02:54:18,140 --> 02:54:21,460
some points because it was moving a little slower really it's not like I

2255
02:54:21,460 --> 02:54:24,820
guess the people who couldn't get into the 3ds line said okay I'll sell from

2256
02:54:24,820 --> 02:54:29,900
Metroid yes yes maybe not hours but like at least an hour it's crazy how long

2257
02:54:29,900 --> 02:54:32,980
lines get there that reminds me I'm getting my wallet ready this week to

2258
02:54:32,980 --> 02:54:38,940
find out how much they'll be raping me out of my wallet for the 3ds oh is that

2259
02:54:38,940 --> 02:54:43,420
are they announcing a date this week well I'm hearing there and finally

2260
02:54:43,420 --> 02:54:46,500
announced it like in the middle of this week I think was Wednesday that's right

2261
02:54:46,500 --> 02:54:50,460
because Nintendo doesn't do Tokyo game show right but they always do their own

2262
02:54:50,460 --> 02:54:55,460
little kind of like spin-off right they do their own little fan event around the

2263
02:54:55,460 --> 02:54:59,460
same time so that makes sense so I'm kind of like basically unless they're

2264
02:54:59,460 --> 02:55:02,300
like charging a thousand bucks they basically got me locked down for that

2265
02:55:02,300 --> 02:55:09,100
thing I gonna say it's probably gonna be 249 and it's gonna come with a like

2266
02:55:09,100 --> 02:55:13,020
either I think it'll be like kind of like a tech demo II type of game that's

2267
02:55:13,020 --> 02:55:15,660
just a bunch of like the movie trailers and some of the tech demos they were

2268
02:55:15,660 --> 02:55:22,060
showing it on 3ds and then like ocarina of time in 3d or some old-ass Nintendo

2269
02:55:22,060 --> 02:55:26,420
IP that they can just easily do as the pack in the game well they got me at

2270
02:55:26,420 --> 02:55:30,620
launch for DS and I bought the PSP within three months of launch so I'm

2271
02:55:30,620 --> 02:55:33,140
pretty sure I'm gonna pick this up do you regret buying either of those

2272
02:55:33,140 --> 02:55:40,680
systems maybe the PSP a little bit you know the DS I had been having like as a

2273
02:55:40,680 --> 02:55:44,420
paperweight for the last six months there really hasn't been anything coming

2274
02:55:44,420 --> 02:55:48,540
out this year for it no yeah they didn't really show a lot of d3 either because

2275
02:55:48,540 --> 02:55:51,620
there it's all about the 3ds now you know and except for the little girl

2276
02:55:51,620 --> 02:55:54,620
games like fancy Nancy yeah that's like the only thing that seems interesting

2277
02:55:54,620 --> 02:55:58,420
coming out is maybe Pokemon in black and white well that's true that's gonna be a

2278
02:55:58,420 --> 02:56:05,860
big deal when it comes out well otherwise I just don't see my fancy all

2279
02:56:05,860 --> 02:56:09,140
right well zappy any other thoughts for the listeners before I let you go

2280
02:56:09,140 --> 02:56:15,660
tonight um don't buy ruse on the 360 the PC is probably the best choice and maybe

2281
02:56:15,660 --> 02:56:20,660
the PlayStation move version all right word of warning of caution to the

2282
02:56:20,660 --> 02:56:24,260
listeners all right you have a good one zappy thanks for the call later later
