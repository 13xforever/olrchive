18
00:02:05,678 --> 00:02:06,138
[SPEAKER_11]: It was dumb.

19
00:02:06,178 --> 00:02:07,699
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, even repeating the story is really dumb.

20
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:09,019
[SPEAKER_11]: Wouldn't that mean I have ESPN?

21
00:02:09,059 --> 00:02:11,040
[SPEAKER_02]: That's because you're psycho and have ESPN.

22
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,801
[SPEAKER_11]: This is really, really dumb.

23
00:02:13,001 --> 00:02:13,541
[SPEAKER_11]: For real.

00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:14,761

00:03:03,704 --> 00:03:05,266
[SPEAKER_11]: How was your gaming week?

43
00:03:05,586 --> 00:03:18,575
[SPEAKER_14]: I love Plants vs. Zombies a lot Like, I was supposed to go to bed at midnight a couple nights ago I was going to Apple Hill on the weekend Okay, your mic is full of fail, you gotta grab it Okay, I got it Alright, starting over

44
00:03:19,963 --> 00:03:23,405
[SPEAKER_14]: I had to go to bed early one night because we were going to Apple Hill the next day.

45
00:03:24,126 --> 00:03:25,047
[SPEAKER_14]: Which is awesome.

46
00:03:25,807 --> 00:03:26,888
[SPEAKER_14]: It has lots of apple juice.

47
00:03:27,789 --> 00:03:28,869
[SPEAKER_09]: Apple Hill's awesome?

48
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:29,770
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

49
00:03:33,012 --> 00:03:33,372
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway.

50
00:03:35,274 --> 00:03:42,439
[SPEAKER_14]: But instead of going to bed on time when I was supposed to, I was up for three hours playing Plants vs. Zombies and didn't even realize how late I was up playing Plants vs. Zombies.

51
00:03:43,119 --> 00:03:44,140
[SPEAKER_14]: And I did it again yesterday.

52
00:03:44,841 --> 00:03:45,441
[SPEAKER_14]: And I love that game.

53
00:03:45,781 --> 00:03:47,783
[SPEAKER_14]: Plants vs. Zombies is freaking rad.

54
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:49,424
[SPEAKER_14]: And then I played some Final Fantasy XIII.

55
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:53,354
[SPEAKER_14]: How many times can this dude say hero?

56
00:03:54,380 --> 00:04:05,485
[SPEAKER_09]: For those of our listeners that aren't local to the Sacramento area, Apple Hill is a place a little bit up, I guess, a little eastern from us.

57
00:04:06,386 --> 00:04:07,426
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Camino, California.

58
00:04:07,486 --> 00:04:13,569
[SPEAKER_09]: Up the hill, I guess, if you will, where they have a lot of apples and crafts and stuff.

59
00:04:14,349 --> 00:04:21,753
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, the apple cider is awesome, but apple cider is awesome all the time, but it's crafts.

60
00:04:22,597 --> 00:04:23,418
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for watching!

61
00:04:42,608 --> 00:04:43,369
[SPEAKER_14]: Swamp Hill.

62
00:04:44,029 --> 00:04:44,729
[SPEAKER_14]: They've got crap.

63
00:04:44,769 --> 00:04:55,792
[SPEAKER_09]: One thing that Apple does have going for it is there was a place there that had a really good lamb burger of which I got lamb burger juice all over my hands and wiped it off on a lamb.

64
00:04:55,992 --> 00:04:58,073
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a lamb burglar there?

65
00:04:58,093 --> 00:04:58,653
[SPEAKER_09]: That is sick.

66
00:04:59,013 --> 00:05:00,933

00:05:57,807 --> 00:06:00,068
[SPEAKER_09]: They do have an apple cider milkshake that's pretty good though.

83
00:06:00,709 --> 00:06:02,550
[SPEAKER_14]: That's where we have lunch.

84
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:05,112
[SPEAKER_14]: We had lunch at the place that had the apple milkshakes.

85
00:06:05,172 --> 00:06:05,752
[SPEAKER_14]: It was so good.

86
00:06:05,792 --> 00:06:07,893
[SPEAKER_14]: Video games are pretty good.

87
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:11,056
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's go to Apple Hill and pack some fudge just like Crunchy the Bagel Queen.

88
00:06:11,076 --> 00:06:11,376
[SPEAKER_14]: Whoa.

89
00:06:11,816 --> 00:06:13,797
[SPEAKER_15]: We don't need to go to Apple Hill to do that.

90
00:06:14,277 --> 00:06:14,657
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

91
00:06:14,777 --> 00:06:15,137
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

92
00:06:15,197 --> 00:06:15,998
[SPEAKER_14]: You guys have earned it.

93
00:06:16,058 --> 00:06:16,378
[SPEAKER_14]: Hold on.

94
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:22,340
[SPEAKER_11]: What I love is that your mic is so crappy it won't pick that thing up anymore.

95
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:22,880
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what?

96
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:23,541
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

97
00:06:23,781 --> 00:06:24,841
[SPEAKER_14]: My mic is not crappy.

98
00:06:24,881 --> 00:06:25,521
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the cord that's crappy.

99
00:06:25,581 --> 00:06:26,502
[SPEAKER_09]: I should bring the swear bear in.

100
00:06:27,902 --> 00:06:28,823
[SPEAKER_09]: You have a swear bear?

101
00:06:28,843 --> 00:06:29,663
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a swear bear.

102
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:30,343
[SPEAKER_09]: At my desk.

103
00:06:30,363 --> 00:06:31,584
[SPEAKER_09]: What is a swear bear?

104
00:06:31,604 --> 00:06:34,985
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a bear that makes really obscene comments.

105
00:06:35,245 --> 00:06:36,366
[SPEAKER_09]: It's what it sounds like, Rob.

106
00:06:36,486 --> 00:06:38,107
[SPEAKER_09]: It has two different settings on the back of it.

107
00:06:38,127 --> 00:06:47,291
[SPEAKER_09]: It has a switch, which I thought was an on-off switch, and for the longest time kept saying, kiss my ass, instead of all the wonderful things he normally says.

108
00:06:47,612 --> 00:06:53,275
[SPEAKER_09]: But he'll say, of course, kiss my ass, and he'll say, eat shit and die, motherfucker.

109
00:06:54,615 --> 00:06:57,457
[SPEAKER_09]: But I have it on my desk, and it's a really cute-looking bear.

110
00:06:57,517 --> 00:07:02,599
[SPEAKER_09]: It says, hug me, or press me in its chest, and some people are like, oh, it's a bear!

111
00:07:02,619 --> 00:07:03,120
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

112
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,922
[SPEAKER_09]: What the fuck did they just say to me?

113
00:07:06,643 --> 00:07:09,105
[SPEAKER_11]: I know, seriously, why do we not have a swear bear here in the studio?

114
00:07:09,225 --> 00:07:10,446
[SPEAKER_11]: I will bring it in next week.

115
00:07:10,526 --> 00:07:13,448
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I'm not going to be here next week, so I think that's too bad.

116
00:07:13,468 --> 00:07:15,770
[SPEAKER_11]: Why don't you have the swear bear sit in for me next week?

117
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:16,831
[SPEAKER_02]: I miss the ferret, Rob.

118
00:07:17,232 --> 00:07:17,672
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry.

119
00:07:18,353 --> 00:07:18,713
[SPEAKER_11]: I ate it.

120
00:07:18,993 --> 00:07:21,516
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

121
00:07:37,313 --> 00:07:38,795
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't help it, it's so addicting.

122
00:07:41,217 --> 00:07:44,661
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, it's an awesome game, so you should get it really on any platform that you can.

123
00:07:46,604 --> 00:07:48,886
[SPEAKER_09]: Then also, of course, more Grand Theft Auto.

124
00:07:49,587 --> 00:07:51,709
[SPEAKER_09]: And that was pretty much it.

125
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:53,571
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, it's fun.

126
00:07:53,611 --> 00:07:57,195
[SPEAKER_09]: We went back, like I said, to the Lost and Damned expansion.

127
00:07:58,937 --> 00:08:05,459
[SPEAKER_09]: I kind of missed the old open world actual death matches and stuff instead of being confined to a really small portion of the map.

128
00:08:05,899 --> 00:08:06,899
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's kind of nice to do that.

129
00:08:08,259 --> 00:08:12,640
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to be modding it again soon, so I'll be back to the incredible games that we used to play.

130
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:20,082
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, since she brought up something completely unrelated to games, I thought I'd bring something up that...

131
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,521
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

132
00:08:41,713 --> 00:08:43,755
[SPEAKER_15]: It didn't break at any point?

133
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:44,796
[SPEAKER_09]: No, different carrots.

134
00:08:45,016 --> 00:08:47,218
[SPEAKER_09]: He shoved one through a guy's throat.

135
00:08:47,298 --> 00:08:49,139
[SPEAKER_09]: He stabbed a person in the eye with a carrot.

136
00:08:49,619 --> 00:08:54,844
[SPEAKER_09]: It was just... The movie, from the beginning, was just so over the top.

137
00:08:54,864 --> 00:08:55,784
[SPEAKER_11]: What the fuck movie is this?

138
00:08:56,465 --> 00:08:59,568
[SPEAKER_09]: It's with... Oh, what the fuck is his name?

139
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:02,750
[SPEAKER_15]: That actor that nobody knows.

140
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:04,211
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

141
00:09:04,452 --> 00:09:05,292
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I can't think of any.

142
00:09:05,312 --> 00:09:07,234
[SPEAKER_15]: That guy who did that thing in that place.

143
00:09:08,641 --> 00:09:13,663
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but no, it's a really, really just over-the-top movie.

144
00:09:13,723 --> 00:09:20,027
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, they spend, like, two minutes where it's just kind of okay, normal, and then it's just like, boom, all action, just all the time.

145
00:09:20,047 --> 00:09:22,168
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, over-the-top, gratuitous.

146
00:09:22,688 --> 00:09:25,929
[SPEAKER_09]: They're having sex in a gunfight at the same time.

147
00:09:26,169 --> 00:09:26,690
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, there's...

148
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:33,532
[SPEAKER_09]: There's parts where he is... He was doing something with a baby.

149
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:40,835
[SPEAKER_11]: Shoot Em Up is a 2007 action film starring Clive Owen, Paul Giamatti, and Monica Bellucci.

150
00:09:40,855 --> 00:09:42,155
[SPEAKER_11]: She was the hot chick in The Matrix, huh?

151
00:09:42,395 --> 00:09:44,076
[SPEAKER_11]: And she was the hot chick in that movie, too.

152
00:09:45,637 --> 00:09:48,818
[SPEAKER_09]: She was a lactating prostitute that he brought the baby to feed.

153
00:09:50,198 --> 00:09:52,419
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow, sounds like a real family fun film.

154
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:53,820
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's awesome, though.

155
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,463
[SPEAKER_09]: Seriously, it is, like, such an awesome movie.

156
00:09:56,783 --> 00:10:00,968
[SPEAKER_09]: And I do idolize the fact that he killed people that annoyed him.

157
00:10:01,068 --> 00:10:02,429
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, he's all, you know my pet peeve?

158
00:10:02,449 --> 00:10:10,338
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, there's, like, one part after a gunfight, they're, like, getting away from these bad guys, and this guy cuts them off without, you know, he merged lanes without signaling.

159
00:10:10,638 --> 00:10:13,401
[SPEAKER_09]: So he chased the guy down, slammed him off the road, and then, you know,

160
00:10:14,482 --> 00:10:16,505
[SPEAKER_09]: I could have swore that Loki said let's talk about actual video games this week.

161
00:10:32,206 --> 00:10:32,766
[SPEAKER_11]: I did!

162
00:10:32,786 --> 00:10:57,548
[SPEAKER_09]: This is his Apple Hill moment, just give it to him, Rob No, seriously, I mean, I totally missed this when it came out in theaters but, you know, on DVD and Blu-ray and stuff like that until it was on cable TV No, seriously, it's such an awesome movie, just way over the top I don't understand why it didn't do better than it did in the box office because it was just such a crazy movie

163
00:10:57,808 --> 00:11:02,936
[SPEAKER_15]: If I'm understanding this correctly, he's killing anyone that even slightly annoys him.

164
00:11:04,619 --> 00:11:07,985
[SPEAKER_15]: There's no anger issues at all in this movie.

165
00:11:09,276 --> 00:11:20,558
[SPEAKER_09]: Not everybody, but usually it's like, I don't know, lots of funny one-liners in there and just really ridiculous stuff.

166
00:11:20,918 --> 00:11:25,419
[SPEAKER_09]: At one point he gets both of his thumbs broken and he's firing the gun in really weird ways.

167
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:27,100
[SPEAKER_09]: He uses the carrot a lot.

168
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,700
[SPEAKER_09]: He uses the carrot to fire the gun.

169
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:34,121
[SPEAKER_09]: He jams a carrot into the trigger of an Uzi and throws the Uzi at the bad guys and

170
00:11:35,317 --> 00:11:36,659
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just so ridiculous.

171
00:11:36,739 --> 00:11:46,989
[SPEAKER_09]: There's one scene in the warehouse where he rigs this elaborate pulley system with all these guns and they're coming after him and he's watching them on security cameras and firing different guns in remote places.

172
00:11:47,089 --> 00:11:48,631
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just ridiculous.

173
00:11:48,671 --> 00:11:50,813
[SPEAKER_09]: But it would make such an awesome video game.

174
00:11:51,714 --> 00:11:52,955
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's how we bring it back.

175
00:11:53,696 --> 00:11:54,536
[SPEAKER_15]: And this is called again?

176
00:11:55,057 --> 00:11:55,417
[SPEAKER_09]: Shoot Em Up.

177
00:11:55,437 --> 00:11:55,758
[SPEAKER_15]: Shoot Em Up.

178
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:58,780
[SPEAKER_15]: That sounds like a lot of video games.

179
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:04,065
[SPEAKER_09]: No, seriously, I think it was one of the most incredible movies I've ever seen.

180
00:12:04,105 --> 00:12:11,671
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I think it even surpasses Wanted for me, because Wanted I thought was a pretty awesome action movie, but this is just ridiculous.

181
00:12:11,711 --> 00:12:13,993
[SPEAKER_09]: This is like big hit ridiculous and then some.

182
00:12:14,513 --> 00:12:15,835
[SPEAKER_15]: I love the big hit.

183
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:18,036
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, that movie is ridiculous.

184
00:12:18,056 --> 00:12:18,137
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

185
00:12:18,877 --> 00:12:19,358
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, wow.

186
00:12:19,378 --> 00:12:20,339
[SPEAKER_09]: Back to shoot-em-up radio.

187
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,521
[SPEAKER_14]: I have a torrent ready.

188
00:12:22,901 --> 00:12:23,121
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

189
00:12:23,181 --> 00:12:27,365
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I have a YouTube clips of it ready.

190
00:12:27,385 --> 00:12:27,766
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course.

191
00:12:28,746 --> 00:12:29,908
[SPEAKER_11]: My gaming week.

192
00:12:30,008 --> 00:12:32,110
[SPEAKER_11]: Today I actually played Plants vs. Zombies.

193
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:33,151
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not even kidding.

194
00:12:33,191 --> 00:12:34,172
[SPEAKER_11]: I played for like five minutes.

195
00:12:34,192 --> 00:12:35,072
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there an echo in the room?

196
00:12:35,573 --> 00:12:35,753
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

197
00:12:36,794 --> 00:12:37,835
[SPEAKER_11]: Other games I played this week.

198
00:12:37,895 --> 00:12:44,021
[SPEAKER_11]: I played a little more of Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light because I hadn't really played it since the week it came out and I was like, oh, I want to

199
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:46,284
[SPEAKER_11]: and beat more of it because it's such a cool game.

200
00:12:46,304 --> 00:12:47,446
[SPEAKER_11]: So I wanted to play more of that, so I did.

201
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:50,451
[SPEAKER_11]: What's that, DarkSakura?

202
00:12:50,471 --> 00:12:51,753
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I remembered another game I played.

203
00:12:52,254 --> 00:12:54,017
[SPEAKER_11]: Is she just going to cut me off for your game?

204
00:12:54,077 --> 00:12:54,698
[SPEAKER_02]: I see how it is.

205
00:12:54,718 --> 00:12:56,080
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you made me think about it wrong.

206
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:56,561
[SPEAKER_11]: Fine, what?

207
00:12:56,761 --> 00:12:57,162
[SPEAKER_02]: Droplets.

208
00:12:57,883 --> 00:12:58,324
[SPEAKER_11]: The hell's that?

209
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,822
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

210
00:13:15,296 --> 00:13:19,057
[SPEAKER_15]: You should think about fitting Earthbound into there somewhere, Rob.

211
00:13:19,137 --> 00:13:19,777
[SPEAKER_11]: At some point.

212
00:13:20,098 --> 00:13:20,258
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

213
00:13:20,298 --> 00:13:20,538
[SPEAKER_11]: I know.

214
00:13:20,738 --> 00:13:23,199
[SPEAKER_15]: You're a little behind like many years.

215
00:13:24,599 --> 00:13:25,099
[SPEAKER_11]: And let's see.

216
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:27,660
[SPEAKER_11]: I played World of Warcraft a lot because it's awesome.

217
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:27,980
[SPEAKER_11]: Shut up.

218
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:28,580
[SPEAKER_11]: You played too.

219
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:28,981
[SPEAKER_15]: Shut up.

220
00:13:29,021 --> 00:13:29,381
[SPEAKER_15]: You too.

221
00:13:30,281 --> 00:13:31,901
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I did play something new.

222
00:13:32,001 --> 00:13:36,643
[SPEAKER_11]: I played Need for Speed World, which is the free MMO because it's free.

223
00:13:36,703 --> 00:13:37,603
[SPEAKER_15]: It's an MMO?

224
00:13:37,763 --> 00:13:40,284
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a free Need for Speed MMO.

225
00:13:40,624 --> 00:13:42,305
[SPEAKER_11]: It came out on the show a couple of weeks ago.

226
00:13:42,505 --> 00:13:42,685
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

227
00:13:42,705 --> 00:13:43,546
[SPEAKER_15]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

228
00:14:11,585 --> 00:14:25,459
[SPEAKER_11]: It's pretty much like that, but it's kind of such a clusterfuck that I guess around a race or something, there's no collision detection because seriously, there'll be like 20 cars piled up where all the cars happen to start.

229
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,381
[SPEAKER_11]: So it looks kind of funny with all these names.

230
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:31,144
[SPEAKER_11]: So I didn't really get the MMO part of it.

231
00:14:31,404 --> 00:14:32,786
[SPEAKER_14]: The cops are very dumb in that game.

232
00:14:33,186 --> 00:14:33,907
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

233
00:14:52,103 --> 00:14:55,425
[SPEAKER_11]: Talk bad about a free game because it actually was pretty decent.

234
00:14:55,445 --> 00:15:00,107
[SPEAKER_11]: The only free games I can think of that I can talk bad about are Yaris, of course, Totem Ball.

235
00:15:00,207 --> 00:15:00,908
[SPEAKER_11]: That was really bad.

236
00:15:01,288 --> 00:15:02,428
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, there's only a handful.

237
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:07,471
[SPEAKER_11]: But this is worth your time to look, especially if you're a fan of racing games or you need free speed.

238
00:15:07,551 --> 00:15:11,513
[SPEAKER_11]: It plays a lot like one of the Xbox games that I've played in the past.

239
00:15:12,013 --> 00:15:12,634
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh.

240
00:15:13,054 --> 00:15:13,194
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

241
00:15:13,334 --> 00:15:13,634
[SPEAKER_11]: Why not?

242
00:15:14,315 --> 00:15:14,815
[SPEAKER_11]: Check that out.

243
00:15:16,116 --> 00:15:17,678
[SPEAKER_11]: Other than that, not a whole lot.

244
00:15:17,698 --> 00:15:20,740
[SPEAKER_11]: I was playing some new iPhone games because who doesn't love iPhone games?

245
00:15:21,601 --> 00:15:22,482
[SPEAKER_11]: The Game Center games.

246
00:15:22,502 --> 00:15:28,127
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a game in there called Word Challenge and I was a little scared at first because it's by Zynga.

247
00:15:28,766 --> 00:15:30,528
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

248
00:15:46,932 --> 00:15:47,813
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

249
00:16:07,327 --> 00:16:07,787
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess.

250
00:16:07,988 --> 00:16:08,348
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

251
00:16:08,668 --> 00:16:09,969
[SPEAKER_11]: I could go in and look up some obscure words.

252
00:16:10,009 --> 00:16:12,151
[SPEAKER_09]: They have that one game that's on the App Store now.

253
00:16:12,251 --> 00:16:21,318
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like some pirate version of Scrabble where all the words are like R. Okay, there's only so many words you can do in pirate speak.

254
00:16:21,518 --> 00:16:23,880
[SPEAKER_15]: Like R and then R.

255
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,961
[SPEAKER_09]: No, but that's literally what it was.

256
00:16:26,221 --> 00:16:27,382
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it was literally that.

257
00:16:27,463 --> 00:16:30,385
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it was kind of a joke for Talk Like a Pirate Day or whatever.

258
00:16:30,525 --> 00:16:31,706
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I see.

259
00:16:31,866 --> 00:16:34,308
[SPEAKER_11]: How do you know that?

260
00:16:34,328 --> 00:16:34,589
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see.

261
00:16:34,629 --> 00:16:38,051
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm actually launching the game right now so I can read some of the obscure words.

262
00:16:38,071 --> 00:16:42,215
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going into the challenges because X-Link dared to send me some challenges.

263
00:16:43,016 --> 00:16:43,796
[SPEAKER_11]: And I whooped them.

264
00:16:44,697 --> 00:16:45,978
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, because it's X-Link.

265
00:16:45,998 --> 00:16:46,338
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see.

266
00:16:46,398 --> 00:16:50,682
[SPEAKER_11]: What are some of the... Wagerers, Eagerer...

267
00:16:52,564 --> 00:16:56,630
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me look at some of the, like, these aren't words you think of, like, as you're playing these games.

268
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,112
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me look at some of the, like... Did they say eager?

269
00:16:58,192 --> 00:16:58,592
[SPEAKER_11]: Eager.

270
00:17:00,834 --> 00:17:01,815
[SPEAKER_11]: That's not a word!

271
00:17:01,915 --> 00:17:03,356
[SPEAKER_11]: It is a word, according to this game.

272
00:17:03,376 --> 00:17:04,077
[SPEAKER_09]: It's bad English.

273
00:17:04,157 --> 00:17:05,518
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, more eager.

274
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:07,220
[SPEAKER_11]: T-W-A-E.

275
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,101
[SPEAKER_11]: Tway.

276
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:09,682
[SPEAKER_11]: I've never heard that word before.

277
00:17:09,722 --> 00:17:11,024
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought you were going to spell twat.

278
00:17:11,424 --> 00:17:12,305
[SPEAKER_11]: I was going to spell twat.

279
00:17:12,505 --> 00:17:13,426
[SPEAKER_11]: T-W-A-E.

280
00:17:13,486 --> 00:17:13,826
[SPEAKER_11]: Tway?

281
00:17:13,846 --> 00:17:15,968
[SPEAKER_11]: Tway, did you say?

282
00:17:16,188 --> 00:17:20,913
[SPEAKER_11]: I see tire, and I see twas, and I get those, like twas the night before Christmas, but tway?

283
00:17:21,213 --> 00:17:21,814
[SPEAKER_11]: I've never heard of that.

284
00:17:22,134 --> 00:17:25,297
[SPEAKER_11]: And I almost said twig, but I know what a twig is.

285
00:17:26,818 --> 00:17:27,479
What's that?

286
00:17:27,779 --> 00:17:28,641
[SPEAKER_11]: What's a VIGA?

287
00:17:28,802 --> 00:17:29,764
[SPEAKER_11]: V-I-G-A.

288
00:17:30,064 --> 00:17:30,485
[SPEAKER_11]: VIGA.

289
00:17:30,686 --> 00:17:31,147
[SPEAKER_15]: VIGA?

290
00:17:31,267 --> 00:17:31,708
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

291
00:17:32,049 --> 00:17:33,673
[SPEAKER_11]: That sounds dirty.

292
00:17:34,955 --> 00:17:35,437
[SPEAKER_11]: A VIGA.

293
00:17:35,871 --> 00:17:39,593
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's like, it sounds like part of a word, like vegetable.

294
00:17:39,634 --> 00:17:40,494
[SPEAKER_14]: VEGA, like vagina?

295
00:17:40,634 --> 00:17:42,075
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, the definition of VEGA.

296
00:17:42,635 --> 00:17:48,479
[SPEAKER_14]: One of the heavy rafters and especially a log supporting the roof of an American Indian or Spanish architecture of the Southwest.

297
00:17:48,499 --> 00:17:51,701
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I fucking know Spanish architecture in the Midwest.

298
00:17:51,782 --> 00:17:52,302
[SPEAKER_11]: Jesus.

299
00:17:52,322 --> 00:17:53,963
[SPEAKER_15]: Don't you feel sheepish now?

300
00:17:54,223 --> 00:17:54,523
[SPEAKER_09]: I do.

301
00:17:54,543 --> 00:17:55,564
[SPEAKER_15]: You don't know that word.

302
00:17:55,904 --> 00:17:56,284
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

303
00:17:56,305 --> 00:17:58,966
[SPEAKER_09]: If only you were more eager.

304
00:18:01,648 --> 00:18:04,070
[SPEAKER_14]: And TWA is the Scottish variant of TOO.

305
00:18:05,201 --> 00:18:07,862
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, some fucking Scottish words are in the game?

306
00:18:08,142 --> 00:18:08,762
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess.

307
00:18:08,782 --> 00:18:10,943
[SPEAKER_11]: That word would be banned in Scrabble, just saying.

308
00:18:11,703 --> 00:18:21,025
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, so anyway, that's my one problem with this game is that you could just drag your finger around the board and connect three letters and as long as there's a vowel, you'll probably have a word.

309
00:18:22,746 --> 00:18:25,807
[SPEAKER_11]: In fact, you might be able to make a word out of nothing but vowels, actually.

310
00:18:31,162 --> 00:18:33,545
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, how about our guests?

311
00:18:33,585 --> 00:18:34,447
[SPEAKER_11]: How was your gaming week?

312
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:35,608
[SPEAKER_11]: The Doctor?

313
00:18:35,808 --> 00:18:43,219
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, much like Rice Princess, I only own a Nintendo Wii So Nintendo of America, I haven't been playing video games at all

314
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,621
[SPEAKER_11]: What have you been doing in real life?

315
00:18:47,661 --> 00:18:48,962
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you go to Apple Hill or anything?

316
00:18:48,982 --> 00:18:54,144
[SPEAKER_06]: I went... I did, and I ate Captain Picard.

317
00:18:54,184 --> 00:18:54,564
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

318
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:57,786
[SPEAKER_06]: Bryce Prince is just showing me Captain Picard.

319
00:18:59,547 --> 00:19:01,448
[SPEAKER_06]: Captain Picard and I went to Apple Hill, apparently.

320
00:19:02,728 --> 00:19:04,929
[SPEAKER_06]: And we ate lots of apples and had sex.

321
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:06,690
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, don't make things up.

322
00:19:07,071 --> 00:19:11,513
[SPEAKER_09]: You should make a drink that's themed after, you know, Star Trek and call it Picard-y.

323
00:19:11,813 --> 00:19:11,993
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

324
00:19:13,766 --> 00:19:14,868
[SPEAKER_11]: That's not ridiculous.

325
00:19:15,248 --> 00:19:21,696
[SPEAKER_11]: Salacious Pop in our chat room says, Aviga is a little vajay from Italy that hipsters ride around on.

326
00:19:22,297 --> 00:19:24,841
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, God.

327
00:19:24,901 --> 00:19:26,763
[SPEAKER_15]: It's sad that I understand that joke.

328
00:19:26,923 --> 00:19:27,244
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

329
00:19:27,905 --> 00:19:31,970
[SPEAKER_11]: Rice Princess, I don't know if you have anything you want to share about your gaming week, but I thought I'd try anyway.

330
00:19:32,682 --> 00:19:35,203
[SPEAKER_15]: I played homework for the PC.

331
00:19:36,024 --> 00:19:36,524
[SPEAKER_15]: Did you?

332
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:38,445
[SPEAKER_15]: And insomnia for the bed.

333
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:41,887
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's about it.

334
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:43,488
[SPEAKER_15]: That's my game in week.

335
00:19:43,928 --> 00:19:44,609
[SPEAKER_15]: Full of action.

336
00:19:44,689 --> 00:19:48,851
[SPEAKER_11]: You need to get a little like one of those like books to read in bed.

337
00:19:49,211 --> 00:19:50,052
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

338
00:20:14,654 --> 00:20:15,895
[SPEAKER_15]: Rub it in my face.

339
00:20:16,336 --> 00:20:17,016
[SPEAKER_09]: Aw, loves you.

340
00:20:17,056 --> 00:20:20,519
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you can just take junk mail, staple it together, and pretend it's a book.

341
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:22,461
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, I have books.

342
00:20:22,501 --> 00:20:25,543
[SPEAKER_15]: I have to buy, like, $500 books for school.

343
00:20:25,603 --> 00:20:26,704
[SPEAKER_15]: I should probably read them.

344
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:30,748
[SPEAKER_09]: No book should be $500 nowadays.

345
00:20:30,988 --> 00:20:31,908
[SPEAKER_15]: I realize that.

346
00:20:32,029 --> 00:20:33,009
[SPEAKER_15]: You realize that.

347
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:38,694
[SPEAKER_15]: But publishing companies are like, well, we can't make money on the books, so we have to keep re-releasing the same crap and charge $500.

348
00:20:39,815 --> 00:20:44,879
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, and plus they're not giving a discount on the iBooks and stuff now, which I think is ridiculous for schools.

349
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,982
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I prefer like paper books anyway, so.

350
00:20:49,987 --> 00:20:54,531
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems to me, though, that they should be giving, since they're not distributing the paper, they should give a discount on iBooks and stuff.

351
00:20:54,651 --> 00:20:56,492
[SPEAKER_14]: Some of the books end up being cheaper anyway, though.

352
00:20:57,093 --> 00:21:05,619
[SPEAKER_14]: I've gotten a few through Amazon that are, just end up being something like maybe $30 cheaper than buying a full textbook.

353
00:21:05,719 --> 00:21:06,820
[SPEAKER_06]: For the Kindle or whatever?

354
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,441
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I use the Kindle app on my iPhone.

355
00:21:09,782 --> 00:21:14,446
[SPEAKER_14]: So, then it's a lot better than bringing a whole big book with me.

356
00:21:15,487 --> 00:21:19,250
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually bought a book in iBooks this week on the iPhone.

357
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:20,952
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

358
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:35,711
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, okay.

359
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:57,432
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

360
00:22:20,291 --> 00:22:21,171
[SPEAKER_11]: So, good luck.

361
00:22:21,191 --> 00:22:22,212
[SPEAKER_11]: Suckers.

362
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:23,452
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

363
00:22:24,232 --> 00:22:25,753
[SPEAKER_11]: So enjoy next week's show while I'm not here.

364
00:22:26,913 --> 00:22:27,953
[SPEAKER_11]: Also join us on Facebook.

365
00:22:27,973 --> 00:22:32,795
[SPEAKER_11]: Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio and Twitter.com slash OLR is where you can find us on Twitter.

366
00:22:33,255 --> 00:22:33,675
[SPEAKER_11]: Lots of fun.

367
00:22:34,795 --> 00:22:36,656
[SPEAKER_15]: Any housekeeping you want to add?

368
00:22:37,016 --> 00:22:37,296
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

369
00:22:37,616 --> 00:22:40,036
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, let's get into some gaming news.

370
00:22:40,217 --> 00:22:41,637
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki, why don't you start us off tonight?

371
00:22:42,057 --> 00:22:46,964
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, IGM claims to have received technical specs for the Nintendo 3DS.

372
00:22:47,145 --> 00:22:49,228
[SPEAKER_09]: The Nintendo DS.

373
00:22:49,268 --> 00:22:50,289
[SPEAKER_09]: We know what's in it now.

374
00:22:52,452 --> 00:22:53,594
[SPEAKER_09]: Years after it's come out.

375
00:22:57,393 --> 00:22:57,873
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

376
00:22:57,953 --> 00:23:05,116
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, the handheld system will be using the DMP PICA 200 GPU.

377
00:23:05,837 --> 00:23:06,937
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow, that's impressive.

378
00:23:07,237 --> 00:23:08,038
[SPEAKER_09]: Except I don't know what it is.

379
00:23:09,258 --> 00:23:11,960
[SPEAKER_09]: Running at a slowed down 166 MHz along with two ARM11 CPUs running at 266 MHz.

380
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:12,920
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a lot of MHz, right?

381
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:12,980
[SPEAKER_09]: No?

382
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:13,400
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course not.

383
00:23:21,645 --> 00:23:39,683
[SPEAKER_09]: which of course it doesn't seem to back the rumor that it was running the Nvidia Tegra chips and it says according to IGN as well they will also have a looks like a gig and a half of flash memory for storage much like the DSi's do now except a little bit more

384
00:23:42,084 --> 00:23:48,606
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, numerous developers are working on software for the platform, obviously, since they showed out a bunch of stuff at E3 anyways.

385
00:23:50,187 --> 00:24:00,191
[SPEAKER_09]: And said that they've likened the graphical capabilities to current generation consoles like Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, albeit on smaller, lower resolution screens.

386
00:24:01,691 --> 00:24:03,232
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's kind of neat.

387
00:24:03,852 --> 00:24:06,833
[SPEAKER_09]: And apparently, I guess, it's only going to have 64 megs of RAM.

388
00:24:08,891 --> 00:24:09,512
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

389
00:24:28,598 --> 00:24:29,940
[SPEAKER_09]: Do the cartridges not have it on there?

390
00:24:32,564 --> 00:24:33,104
[SPEAKER_09]: No, they don't.

391
00:24:33,365 --> 00:24:34,667
[SPEAKER_09]: But, see, that's the other thing.

392
00:24:34,727 --> 00:24:36,510
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't understand why you couldn't do that.

393
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:39,394
[SPEAKER_09]: Say, for example, have more RAM on the cartridge or something.

394
00:24:42,338 --> 00:24:42,699
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

395
00:24:43,019 --> 00:24:43,120
[SPEAKER_09]: It's...

396
00:24:44,701 --> 00:24:45,181
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

397
00:25:01,613 --> 00:25:02,333
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

398
00:25:22,923 --> 00:25:25,244
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't skimp on important stuff like that.

399
00:25:25,324 --> 00:25:36,870
[SPEAKER_09]: But I guess their reasoning behind it is that, first off, the 3DS doesn't have an iOS or some sort of operating system to hog resources.

400
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:41,852
[SPEAKER_09]: And also because it's low resolution, it's not going to use as much RAM.

401
00:25:43,553 --> 00:25:46,154
[SPEAKER_06]: Does it explain how the 3D without glasses works, though?

402
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:53,110
[SPEAKER_09]: 3D Without Glasses, it's basically like... We talked about that like six months ago.

403
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:55,151
[SPEAKER_11]: Somebody should have been listening.

404
00:25:55,852 --> 00:26:02,736
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it works very much like those... Of course, I can't remember what they're called now.

405
00:26:03,637 --> 00:26:08,820
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you seen those, for example, kind of little hologram things that they have?

406
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:09,441
[SPEAKER_09]: Lenticular.

407
00:26:09,461 --> 00:26:14,564
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like a lenticular page or something like that.

408
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:22,125
[SPEAKER_09]: where basically there's lenses in there that force half the image into one eye and half the image into the other eye and it makes it seem like it's popping out.

409
00:26:22,646 --> 00:26:25,628
[SPEAKER_09]: Or not necessarily popping out, but going back in.

410
00:26:25,728 --> 00:26:26,468
[SPEAKER_09]: It gives it depth.

411
00:26:27,449 --> 00:26:28,170
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's how it works.

412
00:26:30,231 --> 00:26:35,275
[SPEAKER_15]: There's actually a person standing behind the DS and holding stuff in front of your face.

413
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:38,737
[SPEAKER_09]: Tiny, tiny digital midget is how it's done.

414
00:26:41,179 --> 00:26:43,761
[SPEAKER_06]: So there will be plenty of sex games on the 3DS then.

415
00:26:45,017 --> 00:26:45,398
[SPEAKER_15]: What?

416
00:26:46,959 --> 00:26:47,720
[SPEAKER_15]: I would assume so, yes.

417
00:26:48,161 --> 00:26:49,302
[SPEAKER_11]: It's powered by the Force.

418
00:26:50,804 --> 00:26:51,125
[SPEAKER_15]: Whoa.

419
00:26:55,021 --> 00:27:00,105
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, I don't know what powers this game, but there's going to be apparently a reboot rumored of Tomb Raider.

420
00:27:00,505 --> 00:27:07,469
[SPEAKER_11]: This has been rumored for some time, and it's kind of a duh, because Tomb Raider... It's been rebooted how many times now?

421
00:27:07,529 --> 00:27:08,310
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

422
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:12,553
[SPEAKER_09]: Wasn't the last one a reboot, and then the last one before that a reboot?

423
00:27:12,673 --> 00:27:13,594
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess, I don't know.

424
00:27:14,114 --> 00:27:19,057
[SPEAKER_11]: And then this Lara Croft game was also kind of a reboot, but it was more like, let's go this way with it.

425
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:21,239
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's make kind of a different game with the same character.

426
00:27:22,099 --> 00:27:22,680
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of different.

427
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,721
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's worked well all those times.

428
00:27:25,421 --> 00:27:27,442
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, actually, some of them weren't bad.

429
00:27:28,102 --> 00:27:34,324
[SPEAKER_11]: And this most recent one, the Lara Croft game, is the most interesting one I think I've played since the first two on the PC years ago.

430
00:27:34,424 --> 00:27:38,105
[SPEAKER_11]: But if they got it right, then they wouldn't be rebooting it every few years.

431
00:27:38,285 --> 00:27:40,606
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I think there's supposed to be different franchises.

432
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:50,169
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, I think there's going to be new Lara Croft games for arcade download, and then the DVD Blu-ray games will be these, this reboot or whatever that's been rumored for some time.

433
00:27:51,249 --> 00:28:16,782
[SPEAKER_11]: and in an interview with I'm sorry not an interview but a report from Eurogamer apparently says the latest issue of PC Gamer I guess I get their eyes on it first says that the new Tomb Raider is indeed happening it's supposed to be set on a Japanese island and it will offer Laura in an open world it's a quote cohesive level with multiple ways around the puzzles so it's one giant level I guess is how this game is supposed to work Supercroft 64

434
00:28:17,662 --> 00:28:18,283
[SPEAKER_11]: Something like that.

435
00:28:19,023 --> 00:28:23,247
[SPEAKER_11]: They're going to say that Laura is, quote, younger and inexperienced in the ways of raiding tombs.

436
00:28:24,649 --> 00:28:25,349
[SPEAKER_11]: I love that quote.

437
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:27,712
[SPEAKER_11]: She's inexperienced in raiding tombs.

438
00:28:28,732 --> 00:28:30,614
[SPEAKER_11]: She just needs a strong man to share the ways.

439
00:28:30,694 --> 00:28:37,321
[SPEAKER_11]: They're guessing holiday 2011 for Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and PC.

440
00:28:37,421 --> 00:28:38,642
[SPEAKER_11]: Notice how I left out the we.

441
00:28:39,042 --> 00:28:40,243
[SPEAKER_14]: As long as you can lock everybody.

442
00:28:40,263 --> 00:28:42,284
[SPEAKER_14]: Butler in the freezer, I'll be happy.

443
00:28:43,365 --> 00:28:45,306
[SPEAKER_14]: She looks so mad in that picture, by the way.

444
00:28:45,346 --> 00:28:46,587
[SPEAKER_11]: That little picture, yeah.

445
00:28:47,908 --> 00:29:01,478
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, obviously, I really like the game that was on Xbox, the download that's coming out on the other platforms really soon, so if that's kind of the direction they're going with it, I'm all for it, although it's not supposed to be that.

446
00:29:01,498 --> 00:29:04,800
[SPEAKER_11]: They've said it's going to be a completely different kind of game, I guess more like the original, but...

447
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:05,580
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

448
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:12,881
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, the latest game on the arcade kind of has me excited about Lara Croft again, so this could be good.

449
00:29:13,522 --> 00:29:17,022
[SPEAKER_11]: I liked back when the early rumors were suggesting it was more of a survival horror game.

450
00:29:17,062 --> 00:29:19,263
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, if that's true, I think that's awesome.

451
00:29:19,363 --> 00:29:20,823
[SPEAKER_15]: That doesn't even make sense, though.

452
00:29:20,863 --> 00:29:25,124
[SPEAKER_15]: How is there a segue between Tomb Raider and then Haunted Tomb?

453
00:29:25,204 --> 00:29:26,304
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you ever see The Descent?

454
00:29:26,944 --> 00:29:27,724
[SPEAKER_11]: The movie The Descent?

455
00:29:27,804 --> 00:29:28,364
[SPEAKER_11]: I did see The Descent.

456
00:29:28,384 --> 00:29:31,525
[SPEAKER_11]: Where it's all the chicks in the cave, and it's like one of the scariest movies I've ever seen.

457
00:29:31,545 --> 00:29:31,785
[SPEAKER_11]: Really?

458
00:29:32,565 --> 00:29:34,786
[SPEAKER_15]: That would be so corny.

459
00:29:34,946 --> 00:29:35,647
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, come on.

460
00:29:35,667 --> 00:29:39,249
[SPEAKER_15]: That would be so forced.

461
00:29:39,389 --> 00:29:39,949
[SPEAKER_11]: Come on.

462
00:29:40,229 --> 00:29:42,290
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think I've ever seen a scarier movie than The Descent.

463
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:43,471
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you kidding me?

464
00:29:44,151 --> 00:29:44,892
[SPEAKER_11]: You're a pussy.

465
00:29:44,952 --> 00:29:46,653
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry, but The Descent was not that.

466
00:29:46,673 --> 00:29:47,193
[SPEAKER_15]: No, you!

467
00:29:47,533 --> 00:29:48,133
[SPEAKER_15]: No, you!

468
00:29:48,153 --> 00:29:50,735
[SPEAKER_15]: It was not...

469
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,722
[SPEAKER_15]: Why are you mad though?

470
00:29:52,742 --> 00:29:53,643
[SPEAKER_15]: I ain't mad.

471
00:29:53,663 --> 00:29:54,984
[SPEAKER_15]: I ain't mad at you girl.

472
00:29:55,805 --> 00:29:58,548
[SPEAKER_15]: But it wasn't that scary.

473
00:29:58,588 --> 00:29:59,769
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes it was.

474
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:01,391
[SPEAKER_11]: I sat there the whole time.

475
00:30:01,611 --> 00:30:04,575
[SPEAKER_15]: I've seen much scarier movies than that.

476
00:30:04,915 --> 00:30:06,577
[SPEAKER_15]: Like the Care Bears movie.

477
00:30:07,057 --> 00:30:08,759
[SPEAKER_15]: That shit was scary man.

478
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:09,580
[SPEAKER_06]: Pokemon 3.

479
00:30:10,948 --> 00:30:11,488
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah!

480
00:30:11,689 --> 00:30:12,229
[SPEAKER_09]: Assholes.

481
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:13,189
[SPEAKER_15]: You're assholes.

482
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:14,150
[SPEAKER_09]: Shut up.

483
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:17,972
[SPEAKER_09]: You talk about scary movies in, like, you know, caverns or something like that.

484
00:30:18,232 --> 00:30:19,593
[SPEAKER_09]: Fraggle Rock, the movie.

485
00:30:20,533 --> 00:30:22,194
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, did that movie give you nightmares?

486
00:30:22,895 --> 00:30:24,336
[SPEAKER_11]: It didn't really give me nightmares.

487
00:30:24,596 --> 00:30:27,057
[SPEAKER_11]: It actually, like, I'm kind of sick.

488
00:30:27,117 --> 00:30:30,879
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, it actually made me want to go, like, explore a cave, just so I could get scared more.

489
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,300
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

490
00:30:33,461 --> 00:30:34,081
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold on.

491
00:30:34,161 --> 00:30:36,983
[SPEAKER_06]: And now you know, though, what every gay guy in Amateur County does, Rob.

492
00:30:37,183 --> 00:30:37,783
[SPEAKER_06]: Rice Princess.

493
00:30:38,223 --> 00:30:39,524
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanted to go spelunking.

494
00:30:41,325 --> 00:30:43,373
[SPEAKER_15]: Were you going to go ass spelunking?

495
00:30:43,855 --> 00:30:44,256
[SPEAKER_15]: Shut up.

496
00:30:45,693 --> 00:30:48,114
[SPEAKER_14]: You'll laugh if I tell you the only movie that gave me nightmares.

497
00:30:48,414 --> 00:30:48,634
[SPEAKER_14]: Huh?

498
00:30:48,834 --> 00:30:49,554
[SPEAKER_14]: Poltergeist 3.

499
00:30:50,395 --> 00:30:52,215
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of the Poltergeist movies were kind of scary.

500
00:30:52,295 --> 00:30:53,016
[SPEAKER_14]: It was the mirrors.

501
00:30:53,636 --> 00:30:56,337
[SPEAKER_14]: I was freaked out over mirrors for like a week.

502
00:30:56,997 --> 00:30:58,957
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not even kidding about the Care Bears movie.

503
00:30:59,017 --> 00:31:05,540
[SPEAKER_15]: Like there's this one part where they go into the fun house and it's like the guy's chasing him and he looks like, you know, crazy.

504
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:07,060
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm just like, ah.

505
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:11,402
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh no, we watched Labyrinth last night and I always get freaked out with the creatures that take their heads off.

506
00:31:11,622 --> 00:31:12,562
[SPEAKER_14]: I know, they're creepy.

507
00:31:12,802 --> 00:31:15,684
[SPEAKER_11]: No, that, when I was a little kid, I would fast forward through that scene, like, no joke.

508
00:31:15,704 --> 00:31:19,606
[SPEAKER_11]: That scared the crap out of me, and... You guys are fucking trivializing my skin.

509
00:31:19,626 --> 00:31:19,967
[SPEAKER_14]: Whatever.

510
00:31:19,987 --> 00:31:20,587
[SPEAKER_14]: Or the helping hand.

511
00:31:20,607 --> 00:31:20,967
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I'm for real.

512
00:31:20,987 --> 00:31:22,568
[SPEAKER_11]: What the fuck does this have to do with Tomb Raider?

513
00:31:22,608 --> 00:31:23,189
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm for real.

514
00:31:23,609 --> 00:31:25,991
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, she was, she was in a scary forest.

515
00:31:26,091 --> 00:31:30,694
[SPEAKER_06]: And then Vice Princess and I, earlier, we were talking about, you know, Return to Oz, and the... I love that movie.

516
00:31:31,454 --> 00:31:39,940
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, Return to Oz... I'm sorry, like, I don't know how, like, any of you that are in, like, your late 20s, early 30s, that saw Return to Oz when it was in theaters...

517
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:41,920
[SPEAKER_11]: That movie scarred me.

518
00:31:42,701 --> 00:31:43,741
[SPEAKER_11]: It was great.

519
00:31:43,941 --> 00:31:45,942
[SPEAKER_11]: She had the fucking heads and glasses.

520
00:31:46,002 --> 00:31:46,742
[SPEAKER_11]: It was scary.

521
00:31:47,002 --> 00:31:53,064
[SPEAKER_14]: It was based directly off the books and not all watered down like the other movies.

522
00:31:53,104 --> 00:31:56,425
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that they should do more of those types of movies.

523
00:31:57,305 --> 00:31:57,945
[SPEAKER_09]: Not watered down.

524
00:31:58,005 --> 00:32:00,066
[SPEAKER_11]: I gotta go to our chatroom, chat.orangelaunchradio.com.

525
00:32:00,626 --> 00:32:05,287
[SPEAKER_11]: Bonds006 says, the Transformer movie from the 80s because someone died and I almost cried.

526
00:32:05,927 --> 00:32:06,888
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, you know what?

527
00:32:07,128 --> 00:32:07,948
[SPEAKER_06]: And they say shit.

528
00:32:09,363 --> 00:32:10,765
[SPEAKER_06]: No, Bumblebee's like, oh shit.

529
00:32:11,226 --> 00:32:13,169
[SPEAKER_14]: No, it wasn't Bumblebee, it was Cliffjumper.

530
00:32:14,351 --> 00:32:15,112
[SPEAKER_14]: No, it was Bumblebee.

531
00:32:16,053 --> 00:32:18,577
[SPEAKER_14]: But, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, no, no, it wasn't.

532
00:32:18,657 --> 00:32:19,779
[SPEAKER_14]: It was What's-His-Face's dad.

533
00:32:21,262 --> 00:32:22,664
[SPEAKER_14]: Said, oh shit, it isn't dented.

534
00:32:23,132 --> 00:32:23,372
[SPEAKER_06]: Spike

535
00:32:52,338 --> 00:32:53,498
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, I got one more.

536
00:32:53,578 --> 00:32:54,659
[SPEAKER_11]: One more quick line here from chat.

537
00:32:54,679 --> 00:32:55,699
[SPEAKER_11]: Chat.OriginalsRadio.com.

538
00:32:56,199 --> 00:32:57,759
[SPEAKER_11]: SalaciousPop says, LOL, Irene.

539
00:32:58,199 --> 00:33:00,160
[SPEAKER_11]: I ain't mad because if I was mad, you would be dead.

540
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:00,980
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm on seven.

541
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:01,540
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm on seven.

542
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,661
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't want to see me on ten.

543
00:33:02,801 --> 00:33:04,941
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's see.

544
00:33:04,961 --> 00:33:06,522
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of the other movies being named in chat right now.

545
00:33:06,822 --> 00:33:07,282
[SPEAKER_11]: Labyrinth.

546
00:33:07,782 --> 00:33:08,662
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

547
00:33:08,942 --> 00:33:10,303
[SPEAKER_11]: Legend with the young Tom Cruise.

548
00:33:10,323 --> 00:33:11,263
[SPEAKER_11]: It was... Oh, okay.

549
00:33:11,503 --> 00:33:13,203
[SPEAKER_14]: Do your... No, no, no.

550
00:33:13,723 --> 00:33:15,424
[SPEAKER_14]: Legend, there's a scene I cannot watch in that movie.

551
00:33:16,044 --> 00:33:18,365
[SPEAKER_06]: The scene at the beginning where he's talking about the unicorns?

552
00:33:18,665 --> 00:33:19,305
[SPEAKER_14]: No, when he...

553
00:33:21,144 --> 00:33:23,229
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that scene that we can't talk about because it's a spoiler?

554
00:33:23,711 --> 00:33:23,991
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

555
00:33:24,152 --> 00:33:24,452
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

556
00:33:25,467 --> 00:33:34,313
[SPEAKER_06]: No, the scene at the beginning when Tim Curry's talking about the unicorns, and he's like, Mother Night, let your dark arms surround me.

557
00:33:34,413 --> 00:33:36,134
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm like, oh!

558
00:33:36,174 --> 00:33:37,455
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys are both wrong.

559
00:33:37,495 --> 00:33:39,496
[SPEAKER_09]: It was Frenzy that said, oh, shit.

560
00:33:40,337 --> 00:33:41,537
[SPEAKER_14]: Who's Frenzy?

561
00:33:42,178 --> 00:33:44,239
[SPEAKER_14]: They even have the clip on YouTube.

562
00:33:44,379 --> 00:33:48,462
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I'm talking about when they blew up the ship on Unicron.

563
00:33:48,582 --> 00:33:50,103
[SPEAKER_14]: That was the one that Spike said.

564
00:33:50,123 --> 00:33:53,785
[SPEAKER_14]: Because the line is, oh, shit, it isn't even dented.

565
00:33:53,805 --> 00:33:54,866
[SPEAKER_14]: That one.

566
00:33:55,539 --> 00:33:56,860
[SPEAKER_11]: I wasn't telling you about that

567
00:34:22,314 --> 00:34:33,143
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you IMDB Anyway, and Robert Stack's character said, damn it, anyway There's somebody we need to bring back as a zombie Robert Stack?

568
00:34:33,423 --> 00:34:44,473
[SPEAKER_14]: Hell yeah Okay, anywho, Atari launched this thing called Atari Go And they want to make classic games good for social gaming

569
00:34:45,869 --> 00:34:46,049
[SPEAKER_14]: Ooh.

570
00:34:47,770 --> 00:35:05,516
[SPEAKER_14]: Basically, Tom Kozik, who is the executive VP of online and mobile gaming, said that they're going to use Atari's catalog and independent developers to, I guess, provide more casual and online social gaming.

571
00:35:06,096 --> 00:35:07,736
[SPEAKER_14]: Basically, it's, here's our old shit.

572
00:35:07,996 --> 00:35:08,857
[SPEAKER_14]: You don't have an Atari.

573
00:35:09,097 --> 00:35:09,557
[SPEAKER_14]: Play this.

574
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:37,667
[SPEAKER_11]: And I can go, no sir, you're wrong, I have several I don't need your online gaming But we've played their games on like every system that's been released ever Yay, I can play Missile Command again And then like I could put Mr. Awesome on my friends list on Facebook And then just, you know, get all these little like pokes and graphics About how much better he is at Missile Command than me Why can't we just like have Atari go sit in their corner And stop putting out their old shit

575
00:35:37,847 --> 00:35:38,528
[SPEAKER_14]: How about Atari?

576
00:35:38,588 --> 00:35:39,949
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

577
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:44,792
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, they also, though, are doing more things for the core games as well.

578
00:35:44,812 --> 00:35:52,658
[SPEAKER_14]: They have a Facebook tie-in that's going to unlock extra content, or might unlock extra content for Test Drive Unlimited 2.

579
00:35:53,999 --> 00:36:02,266
[SPEAKER_14]: And then Asteroids Online and Deer Hunter Online, there are going to be reimaginings of those in a socialized context.

580
00:36:02,886 --> 00:36:03,707
[SPEAKER_14]: And I quoted that.

581
00:36:04,247 --> 00:36:06,408
[SPEAKER_09]: How does one socialize in asteroids?

582
00:36:07,549 --> 00:36:08,789
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, dude, shoot that rock.

583
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:10,830
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, I shot your rock.

584
00:36:11,291 --> 00:36:11,791
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, yeah?

585
00:36:11,831 --> 00:36:13,672
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, my rock's now three rocks and you can't hit them.

586
00:36:13,692 --> 00:36:14,552
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's what's going to be on Facebook.

587
00:36:14,572 --> 00:36:18,054
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, it'll come up and it'll be all, Jamie, shot your rock in asteroids.

588
00:36:18,314 --> 00:36:19,515
[SPEAKER_11]: Click here to shoot her back.

589
00:36:20,796 --> 00:36:21,276
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, wow.

590
00:36:21,676 --> 00:36:23,357
[SPEAKER_15]: Bitch, I can't believe you shot my rock.

591
00:36:26,759 --> 00:36:28,039
[SPEAKER_11]: This is all free, though, right?

592
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:29,360
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, oh.

593
00:36:29,631 --> 00:36:30,032
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope.

594
00:36:30,813 --> 00:36:32,637
[SPEAKER_11]: If it's Facebook, it's gotta be, right?

595
00:36:32,737 --> 00:36:33,839
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

596
00:36:33,939 --> 00:36:35,441
[SPEAKER_14]: They use the word that I hate.

597
00:36:36,957 --> 00:37:04,574
[SPEAKER_11]: Microtransactions I will make the most microtransaction possible A transaction is a transaction But I've been on that site recently I think after this whole thing launched I was able to play Missile Command for free Some of the newer ones were going to have the whole microtransaction I literally played one level and I was like Ah, Missile Command Back to porn A different kind of Missile Command

598
00:37:06,172 --> 00:37:08,853
[SPEAKER_06]: It's basically everyone's night on the internet every day, Rob.

599
00:37:09,593 --> 00:37:10,353
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, look, something cool.

600
00:37:10,373 --> 00:37:10,774
[SPEAKER_06]: Porn.

601
00:37:11,914 --> 00:37:13,855
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, wait a second.

602
00:37:15,315 --> 00:37:17,896
[SPEAKER_09]: Why don't they do that?

603
00:37:17,936 --> 00:37:20,837
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, if you think about it, it makes perfect sense to me.

604
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:23,838
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody is looking for casual gaming and porn.

605
00:37:23,958 --> 00:37:28,219
[SPEAKER_09]: So why not make a Facebook that's full of porn?

606
00:37:28,239 --> 00:37:28,519
[SPEAKER_09]: AskBook.

607
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:34,302
[SPEAKER_09]: and just have like, you know, tons of casual games.

608
00:37:34,342 --> 00:37:42,607
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, they could be like Missile Command and stuff, but they're, I don't know, they have porn in the background or, you know, you're playing against porn stars or they're porno themed.

609
00:37:42,627 --> 00:37:47,851
[SPEAKER_14]: Or like asteroids where you have like a big dildo shooting floating vaginas or something.

610
00:37:48,071 --> 00:37:48,811
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, sure, whatever.

611
00:37:48,911 --> 00:37:50,772
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, sure, whatever.

612
00:37:50,792 --> 00:37:51,673
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, just porn.

613
00:37:51,853 --> 00:37:52,353
[SPEAKER_15]: Any kind of porn.

614
00:37:52,373 --> 00:37:52,914
[SPEAKER_15]: Come on, porn.

615
00:37:53,294 --> 00:37:54,155
[SPEAKER_11]: Coming soon.

616
00:37:55,856 --> 00:38:06,263
[SPEAKER_11]: To the PC, it's the Atari Go I don't like it, stop it Rob Hey, remember that porn we bought years and years ago for Rob?

617
00:38:06,643 --> 00:38:17,671
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was like Summer Boys or something like that And the back said like, watch these boys beat the heat and their meat In this crazy sex-stravaganza Are you really bringing this up on our video game talk show?

618
00:38:17,711 --> 00:38:21,534
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that's the best line I've ever seen on the back of a DVD ever Why?

619
00:38:23,355 --> 00:38:25,218
[SPEAKER_15]: It's why we bought it for you, Rob.

620
00:38:25,738 --> 00:38:26,399
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

621
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:29,583
[SPEAKER_15]: Because you like to watch gay porn.

622
00:38:29,603 --> 00:38:33,548
[SPEAKER_15]: So does Jamie.

623
00:38:34,409 --> 00:38:39,735
[SPEAKER_14]: So do I. But Rob has the ability to sleep through very noisy gay porn.

624
00:38:41,204 --> 00:38:41,504
[SPEAKER_14]: Wow.

625
00:38:41,604 --> 00:38:42,425
[SPEAKER_14]: At Disneyland.

626
00:38:43,105 --> 00:38:44,966
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah, I remember this.

627
00:38:44,986 --> 00:38:46,286
[SPEAKER_14]: That was the clincher right there.

628
00:38:46,546 --> 00:38:48,027
[SPEAKER_14]: At Disneyland.

629
00:38:48,187 --> 00:38:53,850
[SPEAKER_14]: We all went to Disneyland on the trip with the giggling lesbians of Orange Lounge Radio.

630
00:38:53,870 --> 00:38:57,211
[SPEAKER_15]: That sounds like a story.

631
00:38:57,631 --> 00:38:59,952
[SPEAKER_15]: The giggling lesbians of Orange Lounge Radio.

632
00:38:59,992 --> 00:39:01,133
[SPEAKER_14]: It was Kristen and Megzi.

633
00:39:01,173 --> 00:39:02,293
[SPEAKER_15]: Go to play Atari Go.

634
00:39:03,114 --> 00:39:04,754
[SPEAKER_14]: And then we're all like awake and Rob's like...

635
00:39:08,337 --> 00:39:19,367
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, all the girls, we had a suite, and it was like a living room with a hide-a-bed, and then there was a closed-off room with two double beds in it, and so Chrissy Megzy had one, and I ignored their slurpy noises.

636
00:39:20,048 --> 00:39:20,288
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, my.

637
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:46,985
[SPEAKER_14]: and I was and I was I was you know so we all were awake before Rob and Rob's just like dead to the world and very interesting kind of dramatic like with this pillow half over his head it was funny hold on if you listen carefully can you hear it yeah you hear all that clicking yeah that's all the people unsubscribing from OLR right now so so Kristen takes out her laptop and

638
00:39:47,605 --> 00:39:48,626
[SPEAKER_14]: I brought gay porn!

639
00:39:51,247 --> 00:39:57,171
[SPEAKER_14]: And so it's really loud and she turns up her computer all the way and Rob's just like, snore.

640
00:39:57,871 --> 00:40:10,318
[SPEAKER_14]: And we let it play through like the biggest, you know, this aquatic scene that would make showgirls, you know, completely be shamed.

641
00:40:10,978 --> 00:40:11,558
[SPEAKER_14]: And Rob's just like...

642
00:40:12,853 --> 00:40:13,994
[SPEAKER_09]: I have one more idea for a game.

643
00:40:14,674 --> 00:40:17,876
[SPEAKER_09]: No, this is actually not too bad.

644
00:40:18,796 --> 00:40:26,200
[SPEAKER_09]: You know how they have that kind of hobby that's geocaching or, I guess, GPS hunting, that type of stuff?

645
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:35,344
[SPEAKER_09]: You call it find porn, or found porn, and basically you hide porn around there and mark it on your GPS location and people can go find the porn.

646
00:40:35,424 --> 00:40:36,725
[SPEAKER_11]: Or there could be a naked slut.

647
00:40:37,881 --> 00:40:39,442
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, that's way too much work.

648
00:40:39,542 --> 00:40:40,963
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to do that on my computer.

649
00:40:41,103 --> 00:40:43,724
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, I found porn and I'm going to watch it.

650
00:40:44,285 --> 00:40:46,866
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the new Google Earth little click that you can do.

651
00:40:46,946 --> 00:40:51,849
[SPEAKER_06]: Like just randomly, you have to search the Google Earth for like random porn place and random place.

652
00:40:51,869 --> 00:40:56,012
[SPEAKER_14]: Did I tell you the one time at work I was trying to type in Google and I typed in goggle and it brought up porn?

653
00:40:57,052 --> 00:40:57,292
[SPEAKER_14]: Whoa.

654
00:40:57,312 --> 00:40:58,453
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a few years ago.

655
00:40:59,033 --> 00:40:59,774
[SPEAKER_14]: It was a typo.

656
00:41:00,509 --> 00:41:00,969
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, whoa.

657
00:41:01,850 --> 00:41:01,970
[SPEAKER_11]: Clever.

658
00:41:19,636 --> 00:41:20,737
[SPEAKER_11]: How about Video Game News?

659
00:41:20,997 --> 00:41:23,599
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you know we do that here on Orange Sons Radio once in a while?

660
00:41:23,719 --> 00:41:24,480
[SPEAKER_11]: Why would we do that?

661
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:25,340
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

662
00:41:26,081 --> 00:41:28,983
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki, do you have some... Are you busy looking at porn?

663
00:41:29,003 --> 00:41:29,403
[SPEAKER_09]: He's looking at porn.

664
00:41:29,423 --> 00:41:31,965
[SPEAKER_09]: We're making sure... Oh, it's not a real website anymore.

665
00:41:32,185 --> 00:41:32,966
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, it used to be.

666
00:41:33,026 --> 00:41:33,466
[SPEAKER_09]: It used to be.

667
00:41:33,486 --> 00:41:33,987
[SPEAKER_09]: It used to be.

668
00:41:34,567 --> 00:41:34,787
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

669
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:35,728
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways.

670
00:41:35,908 --> 00:41:36,809
[SPEAKER_14]: Big Brother was watching.

671
00:41:37,009 --> 00:41:37,949
[SPEAKER_09]: They were.

672
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:39,571
[SPEAKER_09]: And they were amused.

673
00:41:40,606 --> 00:41:44,008
[SPEAKER_09]: So, Super Street Fighter 4 is not coming out on PC.

674
00:41:44,669 --> 00:41:48,712
[SPEAKER_09]: I know people are probably surprised considering it's been months since it's been released.

675
00:41:48,792 --> 00:41:56,137
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's not coming out on PC because apparently games are pirated and stuff on the PC.

676
00:41:56,257 --> 00:42:00,880
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, they didn't want to release it on PC, I guess.

677
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:01,881
[SPEAKER_15]: Wait a minute.

678
00:42:02,381 --> 00:42:03,262
[SPEAKER_15]: What does that mean?

679
00:42:03,922 --> 00:42:04,783
[SPEAKER_15]: What does it all mean?

680
00:42:04,903 --> 00:42:09,987
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that their first Street Fighter 4 game got pirated a lot now, I think.

681
00:42:10,827 --> 00:42:29,828
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, apparently they said in a recent interview with 4gamer.net, uh, that, uh, Yoshinori Ono confirmed that, uh, while the PC version of Street Fighter 4 was a big seller worldwide, well, wait a second, that sold a lot and wasn't really pirated that much since...

682
00:42:31,654 --> 00:42:41,177
[SPEAKER_09]: The publisher has no plans to put the new and improved Super Street Fighter 4 iteration on home computers due to the platform's high rate of piracy.

683
00:42:41,737 --> 00:42:47,039
[SPEAKER_09]: They said that the port is still possible if Capcom can find a reasonable DRM solution for the title.

684
00:42:49,770 --> 00:42:52,292
[SPEAKER_09]: Honestly, just forget it.

685
00:42:53,113 --> 00:42:59,901
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to waste all this damn time, spend all this money on a DRM solution, and it's going to get cracked in a day.

686
00:42:59,941 --> 00:43:00,701
[SPEAKER_09]: Just put it out.

687
00:43:02,183 --> 00:43:02,463
[SPEAKER_09]: Really.

688
00:43:03,985 --> 00:43:09,171
[SPEAKER_09]: You're not going to get pirated any less than if you have DRM on it than not having DRM on it.

689
00:43:09,793 --> 00:43:10,414
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for watching!

690
00:43:30,989 --> 00:43:35,713
[SPEAKER_11]: I keep thinking in my mind, I kind of am surprised that companies haven't got to this point.

691
00:43:35,873 --> 00:43:40,457
[SPEAKER_11]: As much as I don't like it as a consumer, it wouldn't surprise me at all if they started going there.

692
00:43:41,237 --> 00:43:47,002
[SPEAKER_09]: It's possible that they do that, but even sometimes there's ways around that, around getting the phone home and typing stuff.

693
00:43:47,302 --> 00:44:10,696
[SPEAKER_09]: you know that kind of thing you could for example have a program running in the background that mimics their authentication server and you just change the forwards on like a certain IP address on your computer so that it forwards to that they've done that for a few things you know like some of the Adobe programs and stuff like that phone home and you can disable that not that I would know

694
00:44:11,296 --> 00:44:13,158
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you hear that, listeners?

695
00:44:13,178 --> 00:44:13,858
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't get me wrong.

696
00:44:14,358 --> 00:44:15,999
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want folks to hear me the wrong way.

697
00:44:16,019 --> 00:44:22,664
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not saying I support this DRM to start happening, but I wouldn't be surprised if companies felt like there was no other choice.

698
00:44:23,584 --> 00:44:40,256
[SPEAKER_09]: Big companies like Microsoft and stuff that put out these operating systems and they supposedly have these ways that the system calls home to authenticate Windows and that kind of thing, and yet there's still pirated versions out there despite the fact they're, oh, Windows 7!

699
00:44:41,317 --> 00:44:43,119
[SPEAKER_09]: No, we're going to have stronger security.

700
00:44:44,361 --> 00:44:44,902
[SPEAKER_09]: And pirate it.

701
00:44:45,403 --> 00:44:48,968
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, okay, so that took three seconds instead of two seconds.

702
00:44:49,109 --> 00:44:54,197
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, well, in the interest of the companies, I mean, DRM is not...

703
00:44:55,475 --> 00:44:55,955
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

704
00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:30,389
[SPEAKER_09]: you know pirate the game probably weren't going to buy it originally so you're technically not losing sales because if they can't pirate the game they're just not going to download it and they're not going to play it they're not going to you know unless it's a really really good game they're not going to go out and buy it

705
00:45:32,856 --> 00:45:33,236
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

706
00:45:33,957 --> 00:45:37,480
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you guys remember the old, like, pathetic ways that they used to, like, try to stop pirating?

707
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:42,785
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, we're going to put a crazy word in the instruction booklet that you have to know, like, to get past the thing.

708
00:45:42,825 --> 00:45:45,007
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, and then you just tell all your friends.

709
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:48,590
[SPEAKER_11]: What's the second word on page four of the manual here?

710
00:45:48,610 --> 00:45:53,434
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and what's the crazy, you know, third day of the week, the way we say, you know, it was like, and then you just tell all your friends and it doesn't matter.

711
00:45:53,494 --> 00:45:54,074
[SPEAKER_06]: Or the wheels.

712
00:45:55,035 --> 00:45:55,816
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember the wheels.

713
00:45:56,457 --> 00:46:05,487
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, for the LucasArts games, they had wheels that you had to rotate around at different things, and then you'd have to read a code number out of one of the slots or something.

714
00:46:07,630 --> 00:46:08,110
[SPEAKER_06]: Wah, wah, wah.

715
00:46:10,144 --> 00:46:39,021
[SPEAKER_09]: and those even didn't work either because you could either photocopy the manual or you could rip apart that disc and photocopy the disc so once again it doesn't matter what DRM solution they put out there even if it's a USB dongle or something like that some really expensive programs like graphic programs and stuff like that that are you know thousands of dollars will actually have a physical device that needs to be plugged into the computer to work those still can be pirated though because people find ways to mimic whatever that device is and

716
00:46:39,821 --> 00:46:41,302
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no way around it.

717
00:46:41,422 --> 00:46:42,903
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody's going to find a way around something.

718
00:46:43,163 --> 00:46:47,805
[SPEAKER_09]: Given a significant amount of time, there will always be a way around something.

719
00:46:48,125 --> 00:46:49,946
[SPEAKER_09]: Because if you can make it, someone else can make it again.

720
00:46:51,528 --> 00:47:20,576
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, well, speaking of a game that was somewhat hurt by piracy, allegedly Halo Reach came out, of course, a couple weeks ago and if you already have beat the game and you're already bored of it maybe there should be a mini-game that you should go play that is actually hidden in Halo Reach It's called Reach Racer and it's a warthog racing game that is inside Reach What happens is that if two people get to a spot in the Oni sword base you can actually play this little mini-game

721
00:47:20,896 --> 00:47:22,256
[SPEAKER_11]: and Reach Racer.

722
00:47:24,457 --> 00:47:25,177
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, you all right over there?

723
00:47:25,237 --> 00:47:26,177
[SPEAKER_11]: You made me drop my mic.

724
00:47:26,457 --> 00:47:26,978
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry about that.

725
00:47:27,378 --> 00:47:27,858
[SPEAKER_11]: Trauma!

726
00:47:28,598 --> 00:47:30,178
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's kind of cool.

727
00:47:30,218 --> 00:47:32,419
[SPEAKER_11]: I like when there's fun little things like that in a game.

728
00:47:33,299 --> 00:47:39,221
[SPEAKER_14]: I just know all morning I was hearing boom, yay, boom, yay, boom, yay all morning.

729
00:47:39,381 --> 00:47:40,541
[SPEAKER_11]: Why, was Dan playing Halo Reach?

730
00:47:40,561 --> 00:47:40,801
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

731
00:47:43,542 --> 00:47:44,422
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that what he actually says?

732
00:47:44,502 --> 00:47:44,982
[SPEAKER_11]: Yay.

733
00:47:45,082 --> 00:47:49,283
[SPEAKER_14]: No, it has a little party mode thing in there where you get a headshot and the kids go yay.

734
00:47:51,676 --> 00:48:11,148
[SPEAKER_09]: And then they put on the duck boots from Castlevania and go Sorry Bones006 in chat says, okay, that almost made me want to get Reach That's kind of cool Well, the Forge editor and Reach anyways is just really credible anyways, so maybe that's your thing

735
00:48:12,438 --> 00:48:18,784
[SPEAKER_11]: Going back up a little bit in chat, Robert M is talking about the copy protection thing and says, the pages with red paper to keep it from being copied.

736
00:48:18,944 --> 00:48:19,845
[SPEAKER_11]: I remember those too.

737
00:48:20,125 --> 00:48:21,847
[SPEAKER_11]: There were manuals that would have like the red paper.

738
00:48:22,567 --> 00:48:23,348
[SPEAKER_11]: So ridiculous.

739
00:48:23,448 --> 00:48:23,968
[SPEAKER_11]: Dorks.

740
00:48:24,409 --> 00:48:27,372
[SPEAKER_11]: But it kind of worked for a little bit, like until the internet came out.

741
00:48:27,812 --> 00:48:32,316
[SPEAKER_09]: Until they had color scanners and they're like, ah, foil again.

742
00:48:33,857 --> 00:48:34,258
[SPEAKER_09]: Shit.

743
00:48:34,298 --> 00:48:35,078
[SPEAKER_09]: Color copies.

744
00:48:35,098 --> 00:48:38,341
[SPEAKER_12]: Why didn't we think of that?

745
00:48:40,290 --> 00:48:43,235
[SPEAKER_11]: Not available to copy these CDs.

746
00:48:44,798 --> 00:48:47,223
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, release date's coming up in a minute, but first, DarkSakura.

747
00:48:48,188 --> 00:48:52,011
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, there has been something that has been spotted.

748
00:48:52,731 --> 00:48:54,012
[SPEAKER_14]: A new Wii controller.

749
00:48:55,893 --> 00:49:06,020
[SPEAKER_14]: It's actually the Wii Remote Plus that seems to be a combination of the Wii Motion Plus and the Wii Remote.

750
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:11,863
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's going to be coming with a game called Fling Smash.

751
00:49:13,425 --> 00:49:17,107
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, it looks like tennis, but with a crazy-ass ball.

752
00:49:19,230 --> 00:49:27,512
[SPEAKER_14]: So you have to use this ball guy named Zip, and you use your controller, I guess, to smack him around the different places.

753
00:49:27,932 --> 00:49:31,233
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd have to see more than just this picture.

754
00:49:32,614 --> 00:49:35,995
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, there is no date out for the UK.

755
00:49:36,615 --> 00:49:39,756
[SPEAKER_14]: The game is listed, but not the special controller.

756
00:49:40,736 --> 00:49:44,337
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know when they're going to get it overseas.

757
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:48,444
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't help but feel this is kind of like a Wii Play type thing.

758
00:49:48,764 --> 00:49:48,924
[SPEAKER_09]: It is.

759
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:51,387
[SPEAKER_11]: Where you throw in a controller with a subpar game.

760
00:49:51,987 --> 00:49:53,949
[SPEAKER_09]: There is no interest in this game whatsoever.

761
00:49:54,010 --> 00:49:59,716
[SPEAKER_11]: Not that I'm judging this game without playing it, but I'm just going to take a wild guess and guess and say it's not very good.

762
00:50:00,456 --> 00:50:02,078
[SPEAKER_11]: It will be the best game of the year.

763
00:50:02,498 --> 00:50:05,662
[SPEAKER_11]: It will be the best selling game of the year because it comes with a stupid remote.

764
00:50:05,982 --> 00:50:13,644
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, if you think about it, the game's $50 and you get a remote that's probably worth at least $50 because I'm sure it's going to be more than just the normal remote.

765
00:50:14,524 --> 00:50:29,988
[SPEAKER_09]: And people should get pissed off because now they bought a remote and stupid Wii Motion Plus and now they come out with something that's all-in-one despite the fact that perhaps they should have, I don't know, put it all-in-one to begin with so that they could do all the stuff that they said they weren't going to be able to do.

766
00:50:30,288 --> 00:50:31,028
[SPEAKER_14]: It prints money!

767
00:50:33,137 --> 00:50:33,738
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

768
00:50:33,778 --> 00:50:36,281
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkKisuke in chat says, whatever, Wii is dead.

769
00:50:37,041 --> 00:50:37,602
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you guys agree?

770
00:50:38,062 --> 00:50:38,242
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

771
00:50:39,243 --> 00:50:40,144
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think, Rice Princess?

772
00:50:40,164 --> 00:50:40,625
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a Wii.

773
00:50:42,407 --> 00:50:43,948
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I use it for Netflix.

774
00:50:46,591 --> 00:50:49,794
[SPEAKER_09]: It's... Poop.

775
00:50:50,339 --> 00:50:56,302
[SPEAKER_09]: It's doing alright, it's just there's... I mean, the game's coming out that are big releases for Nintendo.

776
00:50:59,403 --> 00:51:03,365
[SPEAKER_09]: I just don't really care too much about, like, ooh, it's Donkey Kong Country again.

777
00:51:03,625 --> 00:51:04,726
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow, that's awesome!

778
00:51:04,766 --> 00:51:06,426
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember playing that back on Super Nintendo.

779
00:51:06,446 --> 00:51:12,329
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, let's not forget how amazed and in awe we all were after E3 at, you know, their lineup and the 3DS.

780
00:51:12,389 --> 00:51:15,811
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I was impressed with Metroid Other M, and then it sucked.

781
00:51:16,531 --> 00:51:17,652
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow, that's awesome.

782
00:51:17,732 --> 00:51:18,132
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

783
00:51:18,173 --> 00:51:20,254
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm glad that Team Ninja really pulled it off.

784
00:51:20,595 --> 00:51:21,656
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, but it sucked.

785
00:51:22,416 --> 00:51:24,698
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, you know, ooh, new Zelda game.

786
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:27,120
[SPEAKER_09]: Whoop-dee-shit.

787
00:51:27,220 --> 00:51:32,945
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just a brighter, more colorful, cheerful Twilight Princess with new gadgets and shit.

788
00:51:33,205 --> 00:51:35,247
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I don't know.

789
00:51:35,447 --> 00:51:39,951
[SPEAKER_09]: It's... It was... Sounds like fun.

790
00:51:40,232 --> 00:51:42,894
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a difference between, like, you know...

791
00:51:44,807 --> 00:51:47,250
[SPEAKER_09]: What it looks like on paper, what it actually comes out to be.

792
00:51:50,936 --> 00:51:53,358
[SPEAKER_09]: Something that works in theory but not in practice Something that works in theory but not in practice

793
00:52:19,033 --> 00:52:22,023
[SPEAKER_09]: Except now that it has a stupid controller thing in it.

794
00:52:25,071 --> 00:52:25,371
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

795
00:52:25,651 --> 00:52:30,935
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, let's travel around the world and look at some release dates, things that are coming out to a store near you real soon.

796
00:52:31,875 --> 00:52:33,896
[SPEAKER_09]: This week, actually, some pretty cool stuff coming out.

797
00:52:34,437 --> 00:52:41,641
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, Dead Rising 2 will be out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC this week.

798
00:52:42,141 --> 00:52:43,002
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's pretty sweet.

799
00:52:44,062 --> 00:52:46,004
[SPEAKER_09]: Guitar Hero Warriors of Rock.

800
00:52:46,244 --> 00:52:51,287
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, what's kind of funny is a lot of the music games coming out nowadays, people don't care.

801
00:52:52,007 --> 00:53:10,180
[SPEAKER_09]: So, uh, but Guitar Hero Warriors of Rock is coming out on, uh, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and we never forget they're all $60, because Activision is fucking lame, and so they decided to charge $60 for all three games, because I don't know, you're suckers and you'll buy it.

802
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:11,941
[SPEAKER_09]: So, wonderful.

803
00:53:12,161 --> 00:53:15,924
[SPEAKER_09]: Let them get away with that, and then they're gonna be charging $60 for all their Wii games.

804
00:53:16,244 --> 00:53:18,386
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, but it doesn't matter, because people don't buy games on the Wii.

805
00:53:19,406 --> 00:53:19,486
[SPEAKER_09]: Um...

806
00:53:20,487 --> 00:53:24,712
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, of course, Guitar Hero Warriors of Rock will be coming out in different bundles.

807
00:53:24,812 --> 00:53:28,656
[SPEAKER_09]: They have one with the full band set up, which is really just the instruments from last year.

808
00:53:29,116 --> 00:53:30,477
[SPEAKER_09]: So don't expect the new guitar in that.

809
00:53:30,518 --> 00:53:33,941
[SPEAKER_09]: You can only get that in the guitar kit, and they aren't selling the guitar separately.

810
00:53:34,041 --> 00:53:38,806
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you want the lame new guitar that's out there, you're going to have to buy it in that stupid bundle.

811
00:53:40,027 --> 00:53:41,348
[SPEAKER_09]: Other fun stuff coming out this week.

812

[SPEAKER_09]: They're calling it the Deluxe Edition.

814
00:53:45,530 --> 00:53:47,471
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe that's with some of the download content.

815
00:53:47,772 --> 00:53:49,953
[SPEAKER_09]: Or not download content, but the expansions that were in there.

816
00:53:54,155 --> 00:53:57,397
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Sims 3 and Sims 3 Ambitions.

817
00:53:57,417 --> 00:53:58,638

[SPEAKER_09]: Farm Frenzy Animal Country on the DS Deer Drive on the DS, it's a deer hunting game Front Mission Evolved on Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 this is kind of not necessarily the tactical strategy game as before but it is a armored core clone so that'll be coming from Square Enix and I don't know if it'll be very good oh and it's also on PC

[SPEAKER_15]: Let's have a prank party.

00:56:39,006 --> 00:56:39,466
[SPEAKER_09]: Ah, yes.

839
00:56:39,546 --> 00:56:41,668
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you guess who this is coming to us from?

840
00:56:42,569 --> 00:56:47,994
[SPEAKER_09]: They're a company that used to make really awesome stuff and then they purchased this smaller company.

841
00:56:49,095 --> 00:56:49,676
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.

842
00:56:49,776 --> 00:56:52,438
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Hudson coming to us from Konami.

843
00:56:52,498 --> 00:56:58,304
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Konami, because we really need some more party games on the Wii because there just wasn't enough party games.

844
00:56:58,324 --> 00:56:59,545
[SPEAKER_11]: What kind of pranks can you pull?

845
00:57:00,606 --> 00:57:01,626
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a good question.

846
00:57:01,726 --> 00:57:03,467
[SPEAKER_09]: What kind of pranks can we pull?

847
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:05,148
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see here.

848
00:57:06,388 --> 00:57:07,629
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, it's incredibly fun.

849
00:57:07,649 --> 00:57:10,830
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a smart mix of 100 brain-teasing, puzzle-solving, and reflex-testing games.

850
00:57:11,170 --> 00:57:11,570
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait a second.

851
00:57:11,750 --> 00:57:12,750
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not a prank at all.

852
00:57:13,331 --> 00:57:14,391
[SPEAKER_09]: The Haas fooled you.

853
00:57:14,411 --> 00:57:15,471
[SPEAKER_09]: It's actually brain games.

854
00:57:16,172 --> 00:57:16,872
[SPEAKER_09]: Pranks on you.

855
00:57:17,952 --> 00:57:21,853
[SPEAKER_06]: No pantsing, no putting rice in the freezer.

856
00:57:21,993 --> 00:57:28,054
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently while you're playing the game, though, you can tease the competition with outlandish pranks.

857
00:57:28,514 --> 00:57:30,154
[SPEAKER_09]: All in the name of good, clean fun.

858
00:57:30,234 --> 00:57:36,296
[SPEAKER_09]: Embarrassing outfits, side-splitting, family-friendly pranks that make light-hearted taunts.

859
00:57:36,776 --> 00:57:37,056
[SPEAKER_09]: Oops!

860
00:57:37,116 --> 00:57:42,437
[SPEAKER_09]: Prank Party will have players coming back for more off-the-wall four-player action time and time again.

861
00:57:43,077 --> 00:57:43,837
[SPEAKER_09]: No, they won't!

862
00:57:44,838 --> 00:57:46,781
[SPEAKER_11]: No one cares.

863
00:57:46,821 --> 00:57:49,766
[SPEAKER_11]: Frisbee in chat says, I thought Loki was going to say, oops, pregnant.

864
00:57:52,210 --> 00:57:53,532
[SPEAKER_11]: Oops, pregnant party.

865
00:57:55,295 --> 00:57:56,637
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd go to that party.

866
00:57:58,021 --> 00:57:59,021
[SPEAKER_11]: Oops, I got pregnant.

867
00:57:59,502 --> 00:58:01,002
[SPEAKER_11]: My baby!

868
00:58:01,162 --> 00:58:03,463
[SPEAKER_11]: Actdeft in chat says, Oops, prank party.

869
00:58:03,543 --> 00:58:04,984
[SPEAKER_11]: Isn't that OLR every other week?

870
00:58:05,804 --> 00:58:07,704
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, zing.

871
00:58:07,744 --> 00:58:08,225
[SPEAKER_09]: Zing.

872
00:58:08,245 --> 00:58:11,926
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see, Sid Meier's Pirates coming out on Wii this week.

873
00:58:12,686 --> 00:58:15,247
[SPEAKER_09]: The Guild 2 Renaissance on PC.

874
00:58:15,567 --> 00:58:17,728
[SPEAKER_09]: Haunted House, the remake of the Atari game.

875
00:58:17,768 --> 00:58:22,570
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Atari, for bringing out wonderful games that are not... Oh, wait, no, this is a remake of an old...

876
00:58:23,430 --> 00:58:24,511
[SPEAKER_09]: Classic Atari game.

877
00:58:24,751 --> 00:58:26,431
[SPEAKER_09]: That's on the Wii.

878
00:58:26,712 --> 00:58:30,714
[SPEAKER_09]: Guess I'll just have to wait for my Xbox 360, Xbox Live Arcade version to come out.

879
00:58:31,254 --> 00:58:32,795
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm highly anticipating that one.

880
00:58:34,035 --> 00:58:36,736
[SPEAKER_11]: Frisbee in chat says, cutting the brakes out of someone's car.

881
00:58:37,057 --> 00:58:38,957
[SPEAKER_11]: Now that's a prank party game I'd play.

882
00:58:39,118 --> 00:58:40,258
[SPEAKER_11]: That sounds like fun.

883
00:58:40,318 --> 00:58:43,660
[SPEAKER_11]: Like really horrific things you can't do in real life.

884
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:47,181
[SPEAKER_15]: Or you know when you offer someone a Jamba Juice and there's no Jamba Juice in there?

885
00:58:47,361 --> 00:58:48,302
[SPEAKER_11]: Shut up, you're a bitch.

886
00:58:48,462 --> 00:58:49,142
[SPEAKER_15]: You're a bitch.

887
00:59:09,901 --> 00:59:16,207
[SPEAKER_09]: And thanks to our wonderful DJ friend from the Bay Area, Get Fit with Mel B's coming out this week on PlayStation 3.

888
00:59:17,288 --> 00:59:23,934
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, it'll be the first, guess what, this is a collector's item because it's the first PlayStation Move fitness game.

889
00:59:23,954 --> 00:59:28,358
[SPEAKER_09]: Now I'm not really excited about that, it's going to be crap.

890
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:30,721
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, I'm Mel B.

891
00:59:33,628 --> 00:59:39,993
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a Jenny McCarthy fitness game on the Wii, and I would love to do all those nasty exercises that must be in this game.

892
00:59:40,053 --> 00:59:45,837
[SPEAKER_11]: Every time I think about the Spice Girls in a video game, though, I just can't help but hear in my mind, let's put another girl through her pieces.

893
00:59:47,078 --> 00:59:50,580
[SPEAKER_11]: If you've ever played the Spice Girls game on PS1, which none of you probably have.

894
00:59:51,180 --> 00:59:53,322
[SPEAKER_09]: Still a few more things coming out this week.

895
00:59:53,342 --> 00:59:54,403
[SPEAKER_09]: Good God.

896
00:59:54,503 --> 00:59:56,784
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, it's getting in the fourth quarter stuff.

897
00:59:56,804 --> 00:59:58,685
[SPEAKER_09]: And I love how it's all crap like Oops!

898
00:59:58,745 --> 01:00:00,387
[SPEAKER_11]: Prank Party, just bogging down.

899
01:00:00,427 --> 01:00:04,629
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, okay, there's a lot of crap that comes out in between our Call of Duty games.

900
01:00:04,669 --> 01:00:05,190
[SPEAKER_09]: Make it snappy.

901
01:00:05,950 --> 01:00:07,091
[SPEAKER_09]: Script Spelling Bee.

902
01:00:07,131 --> 01:00:09,092
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a Spelling Bee game on the DS.

903
01:00:09,132 --> 01:00:09,953
[SPEAKER_09]: That'll be exciting.

904
01:00:10,393 --> 01:00:13,716
[SPEAKER_09]: Death Smiles, the version without all the fun extra stuff.

905
01:00:13,856 --> 01:00:15,257
[SPEAKER_09]: It's slightly cheaper on Xbox 360.

906
01:00:15,577 --> 01:00:16,918
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a re-release there.

907
01:00:17,538 --> 01:00:23,263
[SPEAKER_09]: Final Fantasy XIV, the I Had to Wait Another Week edition that is coming to us on PC.

908
01:00:24,785 --> 01:00:27,207
[SPEAKER_09]: Painkiller, Pandemonium on PC.

909
01:00:27,607 --> 01:00:29,989
[SPEAKER_09]: What's pandemonium about it is it's probably not good.

910
01:00:30,690 --> 01:00:31,110
[SPEAKER_09]: And then...

911
01:00:33,436 --> 01:00:37,580
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think this dates right, but they're saying the Sly Collection is coming out on PlayStation 3.

912
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:39,542
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's later in the year.

913
01:00:40,042 --> 01:00:44,186
[SPEAKER_09]: And then finally, this is high quality Wii games for you.

914
01:00:44,467 --> 01:00:50,492
[SPEAKER_09]: This is one of those first party games from Nintendo that's really going to innovate and change the whole landscape of the Wii.

915
01:00:51,153 --> 01:00:51,653
[SPEAKER_09]: Wii Party.

916
01:00:53,175 --> 01:00:53,936
[SPEAKER_09]: Coming to us on the Wii.

917
01:00:54,296 --> 01:00:56,638
[SPEAKER_09]: That's also from Hudson that made the Mario Party games.

918
01:00:56,698 --> 01:00:57,579
[SPEAKER_09]: I played it at E3.

919
01:00:57,619 --> 01:00:58,099
[SPEAKER_09]: It was cute.

920
01:00:59,306 --> 01:01:01,047
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's another party game.

921
01:01:01,848 --> 01:01:05,311
[SPEAKER_09]: That's just like them complaining on the GameCube.

922
01:01:05,331 --> 01:01:06,932
[SPEAKER_09]: People only buy it for kids' stuff.

923
01:01:07,012 --> 01:01:08,113
[SPEAKER_09]: It's only got kids' games.

924
01:01:09,053 --> 01:01:13,036
[SPEAKER_09]: Why can't we get people to actually develop mature games on our system?

925
01:01:13,056 --> 01:01:14,377
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know why.

926
01:01:14,998 --> 01:01:17,039
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, I have a question for anyone.

927
01:01:17,780 --> 01:01:17,900
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

928
01:01:18,652 --> 01:01:30,838
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, when you've heard of this game that's going to come out and it's really hyped and it sounds really good and you really want to play it and then you actually get it, lately, has it lived up to the hype for you?

929
01:01:32,298 --> 01:01:34,319
[SPEAKER_11]: You mean like Final Fantasy XIV when I played the beta?

930
01:01:34,339 --> 01:01:34,540
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

931
01:01:34,660 --> 01:01:36,021
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I wanted to cry.

932
01:01:37,041 --> 01:01:37,662
[SPEAKER_11]: Tears of joy?

933
01:01:37,862 --> 01:01:38,102
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

934
01:01:39,103 --> 01:01:39,783
[SPEAKER_11]: Tears of pain.

935
01:01:40,163 --> 01:01:40,604
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't worry.

936
01:01:40,644 --> 01:01:48,189
[SPEAKER_09]: They're limiting the amount of suffering you actually have to endure because you can't play long hours on this game because they will start dropping your XP.

937
01:01:48,869 --> 01:01:49,310
[SPEAKER_15]: Really?

938
01:01:49,510 --> 01:01:49,670
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

939
01:01:50,011 --> 01:01:53,495
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't played the full game yet, and like, here's the sick thing.

940
01:01:53,515 --> 01:01:54,857
[SPEAKER_11]: Y'all, I am really sick, okay?

941
01:01:54,877 --> 01:01:55,578
[SPEAKER_11]: We know you're sick.

942
01:01:55,638 --> 01:01:56,259
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's the thing.

943
01:01:57,480 --> 01:02:02,526
[SPEAKER_11]: Even though, like, I really hated the beta, I still feel like I need to buy the retail game to give it a fair chance.

944
01:02:02,546 --> 01:02:02,607
[SPEAKER_11]: Why?

945
01:02:02,627 --> 01:02:02,727
[SPEAKER_11]: Why?

946
01:02:02,747 --> 01:02:06,792
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I spent so much time on XI, and it's a Final Fantasy game.

947
01:02:06,852 --> 01:02:07,473
[SPEAKER_11]: Sub!

948
01:02:08,073 --> 01:02:09,875
[SPEAKER_15]: That's exactly what I'm talking about.

949
01:02:10,276 --> 01:02:10,696
[SPEAKER_13]: Just say no.

950
01:02:10,716 --> 01:02:10,857
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't.

951
01:02:10,877 --> 01:02:12,879
[SPEAKER_15]: The state of the industry these days.

952
01:02:13,379 --> 01:02:14,701
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a problem.

953
01:02:15,181 --> 01:02:16,303
[SPEAKER_15]: You do have a problem.

954
01:02:16,343 --> 01:02:18,225
[SPEAKER_15]: It's called wasting your money on shit.

955
01:02:19,807 --> 01:02:20,347
[SPEAKER_15]: Don't do it, Ron.

956
01:02:20,367 --> 01:02:22,229
[SPEAKER_11]: How about you just wait for the reviews to come out?

957
01:02:22,550 --> 01:02:26,034
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I'm gonna try and see if some of the reviews, what they say.

958
01:02:26,897 --> 01:02:27,918
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for watching!

959
01:02:42,638 --> 01:02:43,979
[SPEAKER_15]: What do you think, Rob?

960
01:02:46,361 --> 01:02:46,701
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

961
01:02:46,801 --> 01:02:49,864
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought Final Fantasy XIII was pretty awesome and it had a lot of hype behind it.

962
01:02:49,964 --> 01:02:51,845
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, not XIV, but XIII was pretty good.

963
01:02:53,426 --> 01:02:53,826
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

964
01:02:54,107 --> 01:02:55,868
[SPEAKER_11]: Sometimes the hype machine can kind of ruin games.

965
01:02:56,548 --> 01:03:01,012
[SPEAKER_11]: I think part of the reason I didn't want to buy Halo Reach is that you just can't get away from it.

966
01:03:01,492 --> 01:03:07,216
[SPEAKER_11]: I was playing Lara Croft online and I actually got an Xbox Live message from somebody who was like, what, you're not playing Halo Reach?

967
01:03:07,256 --> 01:03:07,817
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm just like...

968
01:03:08,457 --> 01:03:09,018
[SPEAKER_11]: Screw you!

969
01:03:09,078 --> 01:03:09,938
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll play what I want!

970
01:03:10,639 --> 01:03:17,443
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, I'm gonna put in frickin' Cameo or one of the Xbox 360 launch games just to irritate you.

971
01:03:17,823 --> 01:03:22,246
[SPEAKER_11]: But then I realized I'd actually have to play Cameo and I don't know if that would actually be fun.

972
01:03:22,387 --> 01:03:29,051
[SPEAKER_09]: I saw someone this week playing on my friends list and you know who you are, I think, because I don't remember who you are.

973
01:03:30,572 --> 01:03:32,633
[SPEAKER_09]: Someone was actually playing Lost Via Domus.

974
01:03:33,594 --> 01:03:34,054
[SPEAKER_09]: What is that?

975
01:03:34,174 --> 01:03:36,556
[SPEAKER_09]: The Lost console game.

976
01:03:36,576 --> 01:03:36,636
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

977
01:03:38,257 --> 01:03:45,060
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, let's go to Japanese release dates of Loki's done with the U.S.

978
01:03:58,561 --> 01:04:01,683
[SPEAKER_11]: Dead Rising 2 Dead Rising 2 Dead Rising 2 Dead Rising 2 Dead Rising 2 Dead Rising 2

979
01:04:28,339 --> 01:04:31,902
[SPEAKER_11]: A game called Quantum Theory comes out on the Xbox 360 this week in Japan.

980
01:04:32,143 --> 01:04:33,724
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a regular and limited edition.

981
01:04:33,784 --> 01:04:38,609
[SPEAKER_11]: It looks like a Bayonetta-y type of game.

982
01:04:38,689 --> 01:04:44,636
[SPEAKER_11]: Lots of epic-looking cutscenes and guns and swords and limbs falling off and all that fun stuff.

983
01:04:44,656 --> 01:04:45,296
[SPEAKER_11]: That's from Tecmo.

984
01:04:46,297 --> 01:04:47,379
[SPEAKER_11]: I wonder if it's a Team Ninja game.

985
01:04:47,839 --> 01:04:48,520
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think it is, though.

986
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:49,621
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

987
01:05:07,612 --> 01:05:11,573
[SPEAKER_11]: Going over to the Nintendo Wii to check out the releases over there.

988
01:05:12,033 --> 01:05:14,594
[SPEAKER_11]: We have really not a lot this week.

989
01:05:14,674 --> 01:05:15,494
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of slow.

990
01:05:15,574 --> 01:05:21,736
[SPEAKER_11]: Really, the next big, big release is the Kaito no Kirby game, which would be Kirby's Epic Yarn over here.

991
01:05:21,836 --> 01:05:24,776
[SPEAKER_11]: That comes out in Japan on the 14th of October.

992
01:05:25,476 --> 01:05:27,077
[SPEAKER_11]: Before that, not a lot of big stuff.

993
01:05:28,257 --> 01:05:31,999
[SPEAKER_11]: PlayStation 2, obviously things have really slowed down, so nothing of note there.

994
01:05:32,719 --> 01:05:38,902
[SPEAKER_11]: On the Nintendo DS, Okamiden, Chisaki Tayo comes out this week in Japan, so that's on the Nintendo DS.

995
01:05:39,223 --> 01:05:40,723
[SPEAKER_14]: That's Okami, Okamiden.

996
01:05:41,023 --> 01:05:43,585
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, Okamiden comes out there.

997
01:05:44,545 --> 01:05:45,005
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, no.

998
01:05:45,226 --> 01:05:49,648
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's Okami, they added an extra syllable to the end.

999
01:05:49,688 --> 01:05:52,209
[SPEAKER_06]: Made in Kakeriko Village, instead of Kakariko.

1000
01:05:52,992 --> 01:05:58,955
[SPEAKER_14]: No, it just threw me off because I was like, wait, wait, brain reorganize.

1001
01:05:59,475 --> 01:06:01,116
[SPEAKER_11]: It looks very cute.

1002
01:06:01,496 --> 01:06:03,457
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know we've seen some of the stories on this before.

1003
01:06:03,617 --> 01:06:04,278
[SPEAKER_09]: Y'all right over there?

1004
01:06:05,598 --> 01:06:11,201
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, I just noticed this little post on Kotaku.

1005
01:06:11,221 --> 01:06:13,102
[SPEAKER_09]: They put like screen grabs every now and then.

1006
01:06:13,562 --> 01:06:14,783
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all on this one.

1007
01:06:15,423 --> 01:06:18,024
[SPEAKER_09]: The official Kirby's Epic Yarn website.

1008
01:06:18,604 --> 01:06:26,707
[SPEAKER_09]: So check out Kirby's Epic... He's throwing a star and it looks like a giant penis coming out of him.

1009
01:06:26,827 --> 01:06:27,367
[SPEAKER_11]: Penis.

1010
01:06:28,108 --> 01:06:28,628
[SPEAKER_11]: It does.

1011
01:06:29,228 --> 01:06:29,548
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1012
01:06:30,688 --> 01:06:32,129
[SPEAKER_11]: Lots of stuff on the PSP this week.

1013
01:06:32,169 --> 01:06:32,609
[SPEAKER_11]: Go figure.

1014
01:06:32,689 --> 01:06:34,530
[SPEAKER_11]: In Japan this week, Dragon Ball Tag vs...

1015
01:06:35,510 --> 01:06:37,813
[SPEAKER_11]: Iu Densetsu Zero no Kisuke comes out.

1016
01:06:38,154 --> 01:06:39,495
[SPEAKER_11]: A game called K-On!

1017
01:06:39,856 --> 01:06:41,678
[SPEAKER_11]: Hukago Live comes out this week.

1018
01:06:41,698 --> 01:06:47,986
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a big thing for a lot of fans who are... It's a little music game with chicks who rock.

1019
01:06:48,006 --> 01:06:48,727
[SPEAKER_11]: It's from an anime.

1020
01:06:49,268 --> 01:06:50,630
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh boy, so it's like a music game.

1021
01:06:50,670 --> 01:06:53,674
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and people on Twitter won't shut up about it.

1022
01:06:54,416 --> 01:07:22,374
[SPEAKER_11]: Tales of the World Radiant Mythology 2 gets a price reduction and then I'm sure DarkSakura is going to pre-order this game maybe Rice Princess 2 Twinkle Crusaders Go Go in regular and limited edition I'm going to go go and pre-order that now that looks wonderful looks like a little fighting type of game Rob go out there and get us ice cream so I can do I will not yeah it's an ice cream truck

1023
01:07:23,168 --> 01:07:24,489
[SPEAKER_15]: You can't hear the ice cream truck?

1024
01:07:25,569 --> 01:07:28,691
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't think they had real ice cream trucks anymore except for like the pedo vans.

1025
01:07:28,711 --> 01:07:33,113
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, when I have kids someday, I'm going to tell them when they hear that chime, it's the toy collector.

1026
01:07:33,133 --> 01:07:35,214
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you have a messy room, they're going to come get all your toys.

1027
01:07:35,594 --> 01:07:36,535
[SPEAKER_11]: So that way I never have kids.

1028
01:07:36,555 --> 01:07:39,957
[SPEAKER_14]: Who was it you that said that you were told it was the spinach truck?

1029
01:07:40,517 --> 01:07:41,037
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

1030
01:07:42,098 --> 01:07:46,420
[SPEAKER_14]: I have a friend who... That's the kind of thing I'm going to do.

1031
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:49,722
[SPEAKER_14]: One of my friends' mom would tell them that it was the spinach truck.

1032
01:07:50,522 --> 01:07:52,744
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, UK releases, please.

1033

1035
01:08:24,461 --> 01:08:26,544
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, I just got an IM.

1036
01:08:27,646 --> 01:08:29,969
[SPEAKER_14]: Tiara says she just tuned in to hear Spinach Truck.

1039
01:09:08,406 --> 01:09:09,426
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's it for this week.

1040
01:09:12,128 --> 01:09:12,588
[SPEAKER_14]: The end!

1041
01:09:14,230 --> 01:09:14,710
[SPEAKER_14]: Of that.

1042
01:09:16,051 --> 01:09:19,453
[SPEAKER_09]: Fiend.

1043
01:09:19,913 --> 01:09:23,035
[SPEAKER_09]: So, something that hopefully you didn't purchase, APB.

1044
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:25,940
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1045
01:09:46,889 --> 01:09:53,333
[SPEAKER_09]: People have been trying to get refunds via Steam and haven't really met with any success on that.

1046
01:09:54,174 --> 01:09:57,236
[SPEAKER_09]: But EA apparently is going to try to help people out.

1047
01:09:57,677 --> 01:10:03,921
[SPEAKER_09]: It says the user's been posting about their experience talking to EA support regarding this issue.

1048
01:10:04,441 --> 01:10:09,245
[SPEAKER_09]: Several users have been able to receive a $20 discount code for their inconvenience.

1049
01:10:11,195 --> 01:10:12,796
[SPEAKER_09]: Dragon Age 2 Dragon Age 2 Dragon Age 2

1050
01:10:30,803 --> 01:10:43,253
[SPEAKER_09]: So I guess if you bought APB you may want to go chat with EA support which is of course support.ea.com and see if they can help you out and get you some of your money back that you spent on it.

1051
01:10:47,076 --> 01:10:48,216
[SPEAKER_15]: You're gross Rob.

1052
01:10:49,517 --> 01:10:49,878
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry.

1053
01:10:50,038 --> 01:10:50,298
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

1054
01:10:50,999 --> 01:10:52,920
[SPEAKER_09]: Totally listening to Loki right now I promise.

1055
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:53,681
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1056
01:10:54,241 --> 01:10:56,503
[SPEAKER_09]: Well I'm not talking anymore so that's not really helpful.

1057
01:10:57,564 --> 01:10:59,487
[SPEAKER_15]: Aw, we're still listening to you.

1058
01:10:59,647 --> 01:11:06,114
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, I was offering Rice Princess some black licorice, and she was like, ew, no, get that out of my face, gross.

1059
01:11:06,134 --> 01:11:07,756
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, it looks like dog crap.

1060
01:11:07,816 --> 01:11:09,358
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't want your licorice.

1061
01:11:09,398 --> 01:11:09,959
[SPEAKER_11]: It's really good.

1062
01:11:09,999 --> 01:11:10,800
[SPEAKER_11]: You want some, DarkSakura?

1063
01:11:11,401 --> 01:11:12,262
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't have licorice.

1064
01:11:12,282 --> 01:11:13,283
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, that's right, you can't have licorice.

1065
01:11:13,904 --> 01:11:17,568
[SPEAKER_14]: And Dan insists on eating it around me in his car, and I'm like, gag.

1066
01:11:18,484 --> 01:11:19,225
[SPEAKER_11]: It's really good.

1067
01:11:19,285 --> 01:11:24,108
[SPEAKER_11]: So what I had to do, since Rice Princess loves it so much, I waved the bag in front of her face so she could get the smell.

1068
01:11:24,688 --> 01:11:26,069
[SPEAKER_11]: And then she's like, sure, I want one.

1069
01:11:26,810 --> 01:11:29,052
[SPEAKER_11]: And that means she just wants to take one to throw it at me.

1070
01:11:29,492 --> 01:11:31,373
[SPEAKER_11]: So I let her put her hand in the bag to grab one.

1071
01:11:31,393 --> 01:11:32,974
[SPEAKER_15]: She's all, ew, they're slimy.

1072
01:11:33,114 --> 01:11:33,795
[SPEAKER_15]: Gross.

1073
01:11:33,995 --> 01:11:34,796
[SPEAKER_15]: They are.

1074
01:11:34,816 --> 01:11:38,238
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like you put them up your butt before you put them in the bag.

1075
01:11:38,258 --> 01:11:38,538
[SPEAKER_15]: It's so gross.

1076
01:11:38,558 --> 01:11:39,099
[SPEAKER_11]: Knock it off.

1077
01:11:39,999 --> 01:11:40,299
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1078
01:11:41,821 --> 01:11:43,602
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yeah, bummer about APB and all that.

1079
01:11:44,980 --> 01:11:49,224
[SPEAKER_11]: But I feel bad for those customer service reps that have to deal with all the angst.

1080
01:11:49,244 --> 01:11:50,725
[SPEAKER_11]: Because you know it's going to open the floodgate.

1081
01:11:50,825 --> 01:12:00,874
[SPEAKER_11]: Once you hear that one person got something free, now, thanks in part to this show, there's going to be tons of people that go on there and are like, I want my free stuff.

1082
01:12:00,954 --> 01:12:01,534
[SPEAKER_11]: I bought APB.

1083
01:12:01,554 --> 01:12:02,495
[SPEAKER_11]: Where's my free stuff?

1084
01:12:03,496 --> 01:12:04,296
[SPEAKER_14]: Just like that, yeah.

1085
01:12:04,316 --> 01:12:07,357
[SPEAKER_14]: I found a Christmas card that was sent to us.

1086
01:12:07,377 --> 01:12:08,037
[SPEAKER_14]: Hello, random!

1087
01:12:08,517 --> 01:12:09,438
[SPEAKER_14]: No, it's cool.

1088
01:12:09,458 --> 01:12:12,859
[SPEAKER_14]: It was sent to me by one of our listeners, by Rob Overseas.

1089
01:12:13,859 --> 01:12:19,500
[SPEAKER_14]: And it says, Fuck office parties, fuck jingle bells, fuck mince pies, fuck Rudolph, fuck Santa, fuck Christmas.

1090
01:12:19,680 --> 01:12:21,301
[SPEAKER_11]: How appropriate, since you're Jewish now.

1091
01:12:21,941 --> 01:12:24,202
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, I'm going to put it up on my desk right now.

1092
01:12:25,002 --> 01:12:25,522
[SPEAKER_11]: Good idea.

1093
01:12:26,835 --> 01:12:28,676
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, hey.

1094
01:12:28,796 --> 01:12:31,058
[SPEAKER_11]: SSJ100Matt wants to know, so what's the difference?

1095
01:12:31,098 --> 01:12:32,819
[SPEAKER_11]: Is the black licorice bigger and longer?

1096
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:35,380
[SPEAKER_11]: Just tastier, actually.

1097
01:12:36,561 --> 01:12:38,362
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, if you like the taste of shit.

1098
01:12:38,963 --> 01:12:40,264
[SPEAKER_11]: Black licorice is amazing.

1099
01:12:40,724 --> 01:12:41,024
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1100
01:12:41,044 --> 01:12:42,765
[SPEAKER_15]: That's gross.

1101
01:12:43,245 --> 01:12:43,866
[SPEAKER_11]: You're gross.

1102
01:12:44,106 --> 01:12:45,267
[SPEAKER_15]: Your face is gross.

1103
01:12:45,607 --> 01:12:47,508
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, this game's awesome, though.

1104
01:12:47,568 --> 01:12:48,449
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not gross at all.

1105
01:12:48,529 --> 01:12:49,389
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't know Jack.

1106
01:12:49,429 --> 01:12:50,130
[SPEAKER_11]: Remember this game?

1107
01:12:50,190 --> 01:12:52,331
[SPEAKER_11]: This is like the best video game ever.

1108
01:12:52,431 --> 01:12:53,512
[SPEAKER_11]: I loved this game.

1109
01:12:53,712 --> 01:12:55,153
[SPEAKER_15]: That's hardly a video game, but yeah.

1110
01:12:55,193 --> 01:12:56,895
[SPEAKER_11]: That's like a game show-y type of game.

1111
01:12:57,175 --> 01:13:03,501
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, anyway, it's been rated by the ESRB for the 360, the Wii, and the PlayStation 3.

1112
01:13:03,941 --> 01:13:04,842
[SPEAKER_11]: And you know what that means?

1113
01:13:05,262 --> 01:13:09,106
[SPEAKER_11]: It's coming out soon because the ESRB always ruins and spoils releases.

1114
01:13:09,566 --> 01:13:11,007
[SPEAKER_11]: So it looks like it is really happening.

1115
01:13:11,707 --> 01:13:13,168
[SPEAKER_11]: THQ is revamping it.

1116
01:13:13,868 --> 01:13:17,430
[SPEAKER_11]: All we know is that the game got rated on crude humor.

1117
01:13:18,030 --> 01:13:19,611
[SPEAKER_11]: Quote, Yay, more dick and fart jokes.

1118
01:13:19,671 --> 01:13:20,051
[SPEAKER_11]: My favorite.

1119
01:13:32,768 --> 01:13:34,510
[SPEAKER_15]: Yay, I never talk about those.

1120
01:13:35,070 --> 01:13:35,590
[SPEAKER_11]: Not at all.

1121
01:13:35,731 --> 01:13:35,991
[SPEAKER_11]: Ever.

1122
01:13:36,251 --> 01:13:38,433
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I'm so excited about this.

1123
01:13:38,493 --> 01:13:39,774
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, the picture's going up on Orange Lounge.

1124
01:13:39,994 --> 01:13:40,535
[SPEAKER_11]: What'd you put a picture?

1125
01:13:40,575 --> 01:13:40,935
[SPEAKER_11]: Of my card.

1126
01:13:40,955 --> 01:13:41,496
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, of your card.

1127
01:13:43,617 --> 01:13:45,659
[SPEAKER_11]: You should put a picture up of Rice Princess holding black liquor.

1128
01:13:45,679 --> 01:13:46,099
[SPEAKER_11]: It should be exciting.

1129
01:13:46,119 --> 01:13:47,320
[SPEAKER_15]: No, ew, I'm never touching it ever again.

1130
01:13:47,641 --> 01:13:48,001
[SPEAKER_15]: Shut up.

1131
01:13:49,763 --> 01:13:57,089
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, I think this means now that our show is starting to completely derail, it's time to bring it back to some classics.

1132
01:13:59,480 --> 01:13:59,961
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura.com

1133
01:14:09,284 --> 01:14:15,870
[SPEAKER_11]: You kids and your spinach trucks, you need to stop chasing the spinach truck and play this video game for a little bit.

1134
01:14:15,930 --> 01:14:17,332
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, what's the classic game of the week?

1135
01:14:17,852 --> 01:14:18,913
[SPEAKER_14]: Elevator Action!

1136
01:14:20,255 --> 01:14:20,655
[SPEAKER_15]: Whoa.

1137
01:14:22,457 --> 01:14:23,818
[SPEAKER_11]: Elevator, go down.

1138
01:14:23,998 --> 01:14:25,920
[SPEAKER_14]: Go down the hole.

1139
01:14:26,901 --> 01:14:30,644
[SPEAKER_14]: Elevator Action is, first of all, this is Dan's suggestion.

1140
01:14:31,445 --> 01:14:32,846
[SPEAKER_14]: I love the sound effects.

1141
01:14:33,107 --> 01:14:34,088
[SPEAKER_14]: This is from the arcade version.

1142
01:14:41,707 --> 01:14:43,028
[SPEAKER_14]: Elevator Action Returns

1143
01:15:01,907 --> 01:15:04,490
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, the game is great.

1144
01:15:04,890 --> 01:15:08,053
[SPEAKER_14]: It's, uh, the music was done by Yoshino Imamura.

1145
01:15:08,794 --> 01:15:12,117
[SPEAKER_14]: So, let's go on with how the game is played.

1146
01:15:12,538 --> 01:15:14,740
[SPEAKER_14]: You play as Spy and you go down an elevator.

1147
01:15:15,267 --> 01:15:15,547
[SPEAKER_14]: In the face.

1148
01:15:31,941 --> 01:15:35,884
[SPEAKER_14]: So you either have to shoot them back or run away or hide.

1149
01:15:36,945 --> 01:15:41,829
[SPEAKER_14]: And you get all your documents and you go from the top of the building to the bottom.

1150
01:15:42,830 --> 01:15:47,854
[SPEAKER_14]: And the lower that you get, you actually have to solve more puzzles to get around it.

1151
01:15:48,694 --> 01:15:54,419
[SPEAKER_14]: The control was a four-way joystick, two buttons, one for shoot and the other for jumping and kicking.

1152
01:15:55,339 --> 01:15:57,081
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I always jump and kick at the same time.

1153
01:15:57,836 --> 01:15:59,618
[SPEAKER_14]: So, very, very simple, easy game.

1154
01:15:59,718 --> 01:16:01,119
[SPEAKER_14]: Two players, you need to alternate times.

1155
01:16:01,179 --> 01:16:04,282
[SPEAKER_14]: You play as Agent 17, codenamed Otto.

1156
01:16:07,105 --> 01:16:11,890
[SPEAKER_14]: So, um, you don't have a timer, but you do have a time limit.

1157
01:16:12,730 --> 01:16:14,893
[SPEAKER_14]: It goes into a hurry-up mode.

1158
01:16:15,693 --> 01:16:18,036
[SPEAKER_14]: So the music will change and tell you to hurry up.

1159
01:16:18,696 --> 01:16:19,137
[SPEAKER_14]: Pretty much.

1160
01:16:20,993 --> 01:16:25,399
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, you can get crushed to the elevator too if you're not careful.

1161
01:16:37,415 --> 01:16:43,100
[SPEAKER_14]: Knock out an agent by jumping or kicking, eliminate an agent by gun, and you get bonus points completing each round.

1162
01:16:43,680 --> 01:16:46,743
[SPEAKER_14]: And you also get an extra life when you hit 10,000 points.

1163
01:16:47,444 --> 01:16:55,431
[SPEAKER_14]: As far as versions of it, there is actually a parody called Ella Paper Action, which is a

1164
01:16:57,861 --> 01:16:58,701
[SPEAKER_11]: That sounds stupid.

1165
01:17:00,542 --> 01:17:04,742
[SPEAKER_14]: They had two of them on Palm OS, Agent Z and Agent Z2.

1166
01:17:05,443 --> 01:17:06,643
[SPEAKER_14]: It's based on Elevator Action.

1167
01:17:07,303 --> 01:17:10,604
[SPEAKER_14]: There's Dexter's Laboratory Robot Rampage that's based on Elevator Action 2.

1168
01:17:10,924 --> 01:17:17,725
[SPEAKER_14]: 505 Games put a similar game out on the Wii called Spy Games Elevator Mission.

1169
01:17:18,425 --> 01:17:20,106
[SPEAKER_14]: It's called Elevator Combat in Europe.

1170
01:17:20,826 --> 01:17:22,006
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a port on Game Boy.

1171
01:17:22,086 --> 01:17:26,147
[SPEAKER_14]: There's an NES version that made it onto the Virtual Console in 2007.

1172
01:17:27,727 --> 01:17:33,172
[SPEAKER_14]: and Elevator Action Death Parade is a light gun shooter that uses elevator doors when changing scenes.

1173
01:17:34,773 --> 01:17:35,854
[SPEAKER_14]: So, there you go.

1174
01:17:38,505 --> 01:17:49,075
[SPEAKER_14]: As far as earlier ports, there was the ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, MSX, Commodore 64, Nintendo Entertainment System, and Game Boy.

1175
01:17:49,175 --> 01:17:54,100
[SPEAKER_14]: There was one planned for the Atari 2600, but it never was released.

1176
01:17:54,140 --> 01:17:58,304
[SPEAKER_14]: However, the prototype exists and was sold at Classic Gaming Expo 2001.

1177
01:18:00,106 --> 01:18:02,269
[SPEAKER_14]: It was only 95% complete, though.

1178
01:18:02,869 --> 01:18:04,471
[SPEAKER_14]: And then Sony had a mobile version of it.

1179
01:18:05,051 --> 01:18:17,465
[SPEAKER_14]: As far as compilations, we have Elevator Action EX for Game Boy Color, Elevator Action Old and New Game Boy Advance, Elevator Action Returns on Sega Saturn, which I think I have, Taito Legends set in the Taito Legends Power-Up, and...

1180
01:18:20,210 --> 01:18:21,451
[SPEAKER_11]: So can I be honest about something?

1181
01:18:21,491 --> 01:18:21,691
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

1182
01:18:21,832 --> 01:18:22,932
[SPEAKER_11]: I think this game sucks.

1183
01:18:23,112 --> 01:18:34,901
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, it's one of those things I remember much more fondly as a child, but I actually bought that title collection when it was out on the regular Xbox and kind of revisited this game and I was like, this game is horrible.

1184
01:18:35,501 --> 01:18:38,603
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think part of that's just because it's really hard and I always get crushed by elevators.

1185
01:18:38,783 --> 01:18:41,325
[SPEAKER_14]: I've seen Dan play through this game just like all the time.

1186
01:18:41,545 --> 01:18:41,825
[SPEAKER_11]: Really?

1187
01:18:42,246 --> 01:18:45,748
[SPEAKER_14]: And when I said, hey Dan, help me think of a classic game, he's like, elevator action.

1188
01:18:47,049 --> 01:18:47,149
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1189
01:18:47,169 --> 01:18:47,309
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1190
01:18:48,610 --> 01:18:50,494
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I mean, it is a classic in some regards.

1191
01:18:50,534 --> 01:18:54,220
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought it was one of those games that always kind of looked better than it played.

1192
01:18:54,601 --> 01:18:57,726
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what game in this vein that I actually like a whole lot better?

1193
01:18:58,387 --> 01:18:58,668
[SPEAKER_14]: Mappy.

1194
01:18:59,965 --> 01:19:01,767
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think you've ever done that for the week, have you?

1195
01:19:02,187 --> 01:19:03,388
[SPEAKER_11]: You might need to do that.

1196
01:19:03,789 --> 01:19:05,510
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe Mappy will be on the list one day.

1197
01:19:05,530 --> 01:19:05,910
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1198
01:19:06,271 --> 01:19:06,771
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, there it is.

1199
01:19:07,131 --> 01:19:08,573
[SPEAKER_14]: Good Namco goodness.

1200
01:19:09,173 --> 01:19:12,176
[SPEAKER_11]: Like it or not, your classic game of the week, Elevator Action.

1201
01:19:12,336 --> 01:19:13,297
[SPEAKER_11]: Elevator Action.

1202
01:19:13,377 --> 01:19:13,817
[SPEAKER_11]: There it is.

1203
01:19:14,578 --> 01:19:17,961
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a pretty cool YouTube to the guy beating the level because he makes it look so easy.

1204
01:19:18,381 --> 01:19:19,122
[SPEAKER_11]: It's really not.

1205
01:19:19,702 --> 01:19:20,503
[SPEAKER_11]: This game is hard.

1206
01:19:20,523 --> 01:19:21,664
[SPEAKER_11]: Have you ever played this game, Rice Princess?

1207
01:19:22,044 --> 01:19:22,184
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

1208
01:19:22,224 --> 01:19:22,905
[SPEAKER_11]: It's hard.

1209
01:19:23,485 --> 01:19:24,066
[SPEAKER_15]: Looks like it.

1210
01:19:24,186 --> 01:19:24,426
[SPEAKER_11]: It is.

1211
01:19:24,987 --> 01:19:25,207
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1212
01:19:25,507 --> 01:19:49,870
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, well that's going to do it for this first half here of Orange Lounge Radio But don't go anywhere, there's plenty more when we come back Including your phone calls and your tweets Make sure you get in those Twitter topics at twitter.com slash OLR And we're going to talk about PlayStation 3 updates That wrecked some things related to USB We're going to talk about a website that will bribe you with Microsoft points to use it And much more when we come back after this break With more of Orange Lounge Radio

1213

[SPEAKER_11]: And welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

1214
01:19:59,389 --> 01:20:08,615
[SPEAKER_11]: We are live on this Sunday evening, September the 26th of 2010, where we are taping the 383rd episode of our podcast, if you can believe it.

1215
01:20:08,915 --> 01:20:09,335
[SPEAKER_12]: Damn.

1216
01:20:09,455 --> 01:20:10,016
[SPEAKER_11]: I know, right?

1217
01:20:10,216 --> 01:20:13,097
[SPEAKER_11]: We're almost, 400 is right around the corner, if you think about it.

1218
01:20:13,137 --> 01:20:15,519
[SPEAKER_11]: It's gonna be, what, about 17 weeks away?

1219
01:20:15,539 --> 01:20:16,359
[SPEAKER_11]: It's about four months away?

1220
01:20:16,879 --> 01:20:17,060
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow.

1221
01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:18,400
[SPEAKER_11]: So, right around Christmas, New Year's?

1222
01:20:18,460 --> 01:20:18,641
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1223
01:20:19,041 --> 01:20:19,381
[SPEAKER_11]: Crazy, huh?

1224
01:20:19,401 --> 01:20:19,521
[SPEAKER_11]: Mm-hmm.

1225
01:20:19,681 --> 01:20:20,161
[SPEAKER_11]: A little bit.

1226
01:20:20,181 --> 01:20:21,062
[SPEAKER_11]: No, wait, a little further than that.

1227
01:20:22,002 --> 01:20:22,983
[SPEAKER_11]: Like January, February.

1228
01:20:23,023 --> 01:20:24,244
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe just in time for Valentine's Day.

1229
01:20:24,264 --> 01:20:24,344
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1230
01:20:24,935 --> 01:20:26,336
[SPEAKER_15]: Whoa, cool.

1231
01:20:26,376 --> 01:20:26,676
[SPEAKER_11]: I know.

1232
01:20:27,677 --> 01:20:27,957
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1233
01:20:28,417 --> 01:20:31,139
[SPEAKER_11]: Joining us tonight, as you can hear, Rice Princess and The Doctor.

1234
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:36,243
[SPEAKER_11]: And we were talking a little bit about the break music, which I know you podcaster folks can't hear it, sadly.

1235
01:20:36,303 --> 01:20:37,123
[SPEAKER_11]: It's copyright stuff.

1236
01:20:37,163 --> 01:20:37,623
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry.

1237
01:20:37,643 --> 01:20:38,164
[SPEAKER_11]: You can't play it.

1238
01:20:38,564 --> 01:20:39,945
[SPEAKER_11]: But we can do it live.

1239
01:20:40,405 --> 01:20:42,867
[SPEAKER_11]: And we played a variety of songs during that break.

1240
01:20:42,927 --> 01:20:46,529
[SPEAKER_11]: And the last one we played was from Secret of Mana, the Flight into the Unknown.

1241
01:20:46,830 --> 01:20:49,271
[SPEAKER_11]: And that made Jamie go, let's have a Secret of Mana party.

1242
01:20:49,311 --> 01:20:50,852
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm like, wow, yes, that's a great idea.

1243
01:20:50,992 --> 01:20:51,493
[SPEAKER_14]: For sure.

1244
01:20:51,533 --> 01:20:51,733
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1245
01:20:52,113 --> 01:20:54,396
[SPEAKER_11]: SRSers Don't take a picture of me please because I'm in my pajamas Or me

1246
01:21:07,395 --> 01:21:09,036
[SPEAKER_11]: The Doctor's Taking Pictures in Studio.

1247
01:21:09,056 --> 01:21:09,637
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know why.

1248
01:21:09,717 --> 01:21:10,217
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just kidding.

1249
01:21:10,237 --> 01:21:10,597
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1250
01:21:11,198 --> 01:21:15,501
[SPEAKER_11]: The secret about a marathon would be fun.

1251
01:21:15,581 --> 01:21:17,282
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually got really far in secret at Evermore.

1252
01:21:17,322 --> 01:21:18,603
[SPEAKER_11]: I got really close to beating it.

1253
01:21:18,623 --> 01:21:19,163
[SPEAKER_11]: I never did, though.

1254
01:21:19,183 --> 01:21:19,864
[SPEAKER_11]: I love that game.

1255
01:21:19,904 --> 01:21:22,846
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think Evermore is nearly as bad as some people think it was at the time.

1256
01:21:22,866 --> 01:21:23,266
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

1257
01:21:23,366 --> 01:21:24,427
[SPEAKER_14]: People thought it was bad?

1258
01:21:24,767 --> 01:21:25,308
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, oh yeah.

1259
01:21:25,528 --> 01:21:27,149
[SPEAKER_14]: Wow.

1260
01:21:27,309 --> 01:21:27,990
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what we should do?

1261
01:21:28,030 --> 01:21:29,211
[SPEAKER_14]: We should do RPG a month.

1262
01:21:30,152 --> 01:21:31,013
[SPEAKER_14]: RPG a month.

1263
01:21:31,173 --> 01:21:31,713
[SPEAKER_11]: Seriously.

1264
01:21:31,734 --> 01:21:32,875
[SPEAKER_11]: Good luck tearing me away from WoW.

1265
01:21:35,057 --> 01:21:36,658
[SPEAKER_14]: That's Rob's RPG of life.

1266
01:21:37,018 --> 01:21:49,450
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe, oh, something else about Secret of Evermore, because another song we played in that break was the theme to Guild Wars, which I think that composer that does the soundtrack to Guild Wars, Jeremy Soule, I think is how you say his last name?

1267
01:21:50,070 --> 01:22:17,448
[SPEAKER_11]: is really talented and he composed that when he was like practically a teenager like 19 or 20 I think he did Secret of Evermore like when he was a teenager he actually I think composed that soundtrack so crazy right so I think actually no I think it took the back he was 19 when he did I think the Secret of Evermore stuff and then later on probably in his 20s he did the Guild War stuff but he was very young when he did a lot of that and he did the music to Oblivion which I know you're not a big fan of that game but the soundtrack is amazing I believe it

1268
01:22:17,648 --> 01:22:18,548
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, he's a talented guy.

1269
01:22:19,908 --> 01:22:26,410
[SPEAKER_11]: He did the music to Prey, which even though it was kind of a... Actually, it's one of the few first-person shooters I really, really, really liked.

1270
01:22:26,470 --> 01:22:27,050
[SPEAKER_11]: And you know why?

1271
01:22:27,470 --> 01:22:30,890
[SPEAKER_11]: Because it was made for people who are terrible at first-person shooters because you never die.

1272
01:22:31,330 --> 01:22:32,271
[SPEAKER_11]: You cannot die in Prey.

1273
01:22:32,891 --> 01:22:33,691
[SPEAKER_11]: It's easy mode.

1274
01:22:34,571 --> 01:22:42,552
[SPEAKER_11]: When you die, you go into the spirit world where you have to shoot these ghost-looking things to regain your health and stuff, and then you go back right where you left off.

1275
01:22:43,212 --> 01:22:44,673
[SPEAKER_11]: So Prey is like total easy mode.

1276
01:22:45,193 --> 01:22:46,113
[SPEAKER_11]: But it had really good music.

1277
01:22:46,973 --> 01:22:47,714
[SPEAKER_11]: So, anyway.

1278
01:22:47,854 --> 01:22:48,274
[SPEAKER_14]: Cool.

1279
01:22:49,015 --> 01:22:49,395
[SPEAKER_11]: There you go.

1280
01:22:50,035 --> 01:22:53,018
[SPEAKER_11]: Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com You're playing Plants vs. Zombies.

1281
01:22:54,018 --> 01:23:01,423
[SPEAKER_11]: Salacious Pop in chat says, People who hated Evermore were just being 16-year-old weeaboo square stands and didn't like it because it was Square USA developed.

1282
01:23:01,964 --> 01:23:04,245
[SPEAKER_11]: And Ranma is starting a fight saying, Actually, no.

1283
01:23:04,365 --> 01:23:05,166
[SPEAKER_11]: It took a week to beat.

1284
01:23:05,246 --> 01:23:05,686
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why.

1285
01:23:06,967 --> 01:23:07,508
[SPEAKER_11]: Throw down.

1286
01:23:08,308 --> 01:23:08,869
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what?

1287
01:23:09,229 --> 01:23:10,310
[SPEAKER_15]: It had a dog in it.

1288
01:23:10,670 --> 01:23:12,111
[SPEAKER_15]: That made it instantly cool.

1289
01:23:12,191 --> 01:23:13,492
[SPEAKER_15]: So, there you go.

1290
01:23:14,088 --> 01:23:16,512
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, let's get back into some more video game news here.

1291
01:23:17,093 --> 01:23:22,903
[SPEAKER_11]: Twitter topics coming up at twitter.com slash OLR in just a little bit, so make sure you're... Are you alright over there, DarkSakura?

1292
01:23:24,175 --> 01:23:24,696
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1293
01:23:45,157 --> 01:23:45,657
[SPEAKER_11]: Good job.

1294
01:23:46,678 --> 01:23:46,998
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1295
01:23:47,598 --> 01:23:48,779
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, get those Twitter topics in.

1296
01:23:48,799 --> 01:23:50,660
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to be getting to those in just a moment.

1297
01:23:50,740 --> 01:23:54,322
[SPEAKER_11]: But in the meantime, some fast, rapid-fire news, starting with Loki.

1298
01:23:55,320 --> 01:23:59,142
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, there is an update done to 3D.GameHeroes this week.

1299
01:23:59,222 --> 01:24:02,043
[SPEAKER_09]: You may remember that game, the one that's kind of like Zelda, but not.

1300
01:24:03,063 --> 01:24:09,246
[SPEAKER_09]: This time they've done an update that adds a Sackboy playable character, which is kind of cool.

1301
01:24:09,866 --> 01:24:22,811
[SPEAKER_09]: And then on top of that, there's also some 50 new player-made heroes that have been added to everyone's lineup, plus allows the players to carry weapons over into their new game plus files.

1302
01:24:23,691 --> 01:24:29,814
[SPEAKER_09]: and incorporate a handful of bug fixes that they've done to the game.

1303
01:24:29,894 --> 01:24:30,774
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's kind of cool.

1304
01:24:31,354 --> 01:24:31,895
[SPEAKER_11]: Sounds awesome.

1305
01:24:31,915 --> 01:24:35,036
[SPEAKER_11]: That's one of those games I played maybe the first third and then stopped.

1306
01:24:35,056 --> 01:24:36,897
[SPEAKER_09]: I have not touched my copy of it yet.

1307
01:24:36,957 --> 01:24:44,700
[SPEAKER_11]: It's actually so... Again, it is The Legend of Zelda on PS3 and I am surprised Nintendo has not sued yet.

1308
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:47,821
[SPEAKER_11]: It is that close to the original Legend of Zelda.

1309
01:24:48,221 --> 01:24:51,603
[SPEAKER_11]: You'd like this game, I think, Grace Princess, because you like the old school games, right?

1310
01:24:52,083 --> 01:24:53,624
[SPEAKER_15]: I do like the old school games.

1311
01:24:53,804 --> 01:25:00,087
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, this 3D.GameHero is like one big BJ to old video games.

1312
01:25:00,347 --> 01:25:00,907
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow.

1313
01:25:00,927 --> 01:25:01,488
[SPEAKER_11]: I know, right?

1314
01:25:01,548 --> 01:25:02,148
[SPEAKER_11]: That's hot.

1315
01:25:02,228 --> 01:25:02,528
[SPEAKER_11]: I know.

1316
01:25:03,449 --> 01:25:05,610
[SPEAKER_15]: Wait, so which Zelda is it most like?

1317
01:25:05,930 --> 01:25:06,850
[SPEAKER_11]: The very, very first one.

1318
01:25:07,150 --> 01:25:07,270
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh.

1319
01:25:08,511 --> 01:25:10,492
[SPEAKER_15]: Not my favorite, but I would like it.

1320
01:25:11,404 --> 01:25:18,830
[SPEAKER_09]: This week marked the first releases to the PlayStation Store of PlayStation 1 Imports.

1321
01:25:19,231 --> 01:25:21,773
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, now we're able to play games from other regions.

1322
01:25:22,513 --> 01:25:27,958
[SPEAKER_09]: And the first two releases, you may wonder what they are.

1323
01:25:28,819 --> 01:25:30,720
[SPEAKER_09]: Cho Inoki and Gaia Seed.

1324
01:25:30,740 --> 01:25:31,021
[SPEAKER_09]: Yay!

1325
01:25:33,120 --> 01:25:33,761
[SPEAKER_09]: Boo.

1326
01:25:33,861 --> 01:25:35,083
[SPEAKER_14]: Joe Heineke is great.

1327
01:25:35,744 --> 01:25:38,687
[SPEAKER_09]: So you'll be able to get those on the PlayStation Store.

1328
01:25:39,469 --> 01:25:40,550
[SPEAKER_09]: They will run you $6 or $5.99.

1329
01:25:40,690 --> 01:25:42,473
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see other fun stuff.

1330
01:25:48,240 --> 01:25:54,184
[SPEAKER_09]: There is a fan-made Half-Life 2 movie trailer that was put out.

1331
01:25:54,945 --> 01:25:59,748
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, this is not just some amateur movie trailer, by the way.

1332
01:25:59,808 --> 01:26:04,051
[SPEAKER_09]: It's actually done by an animator, Marco Spittoni.

1333
01:26:04,751 --> 01:26:08,134
[SPEAKER_09]: And he's actually... I believe he works for Weta.

1334
01:26:08,774 --> 01:26:12,196
[SPEAKER_09]: So he has one damn sexy trailer out there that...

1335
01:26:13,377 --> 01:26:14,518
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1336
01:26:41,668 --> 01:26:52,038
[SPEAKER_09]: New Detroit, which is the city that the game is going to take place in, and also looks like it carries over some of the stuff from Earth Defense Force 2, including a jetpack.

1337
01:26:52,058 --> 01:26:55,100
[SPEAKER_09]: And I believe there's four different upgrade armors you're going to be able to get.

1338
01:26:55,240 --> 01:26:57,663
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm assuming one of them is this jetpack thing.

1339
01:26:59,522 --> 01:26:59,922
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't wait.

1340
01:27:00,443 --> 01:27:01,604
[SPEAKER_09]: It's supposed to be coming out this fall.

1341
01:27:02,005 --> 01:27:02,865
[SPEAKER_09]: Or not this fall.

1342
01:27:03,386 --> 01:27:03,947
[SPEAKER_09]: That'd be cool.

1343
01:27:04,287 --> 01:27:05,188
[SPEAKER_09]: No, this spring.

1344
01:27:06,149 --> 01:27:13,076
[SPEAKER_11]: Speaking of trailers, since you brought up that Half-Life 2 trailer, did you see that freaking Pokemon real life trailer?

1345
01:27:13,336 --> 01:27:15,238
[SPEAKER_11]: Pokemon Armageddon or whatever it was?

1346
01:27:15,258 --> 01:27:15,919
[SPEAKER_11]: That was dumb.

1347
01:27:16,039 --> 01:27:18,321
[SPEAKER_11]: What in the heck was that?

1348
01:27:18,601 --> 01:27:19,943
[SPEAKER_11]: For those that didn't see it, it's like real...

1349
01:27:21,264 --> 01:27:22,645
[SPEAKER_11]: Have you guys seen Rice Princess?

1350
01:27:23,086 --> 01:27:26,748
[SPEAKER_15]: I started watching it but then I realized it was Pokemon and I was just like, what the fuck am I doing?

1351
01:27:26,768 --> 01:27:31,012
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like somebody took Pokemon and made it real life and it's obviously like a student project or something.

1352
01:27:31,052 --> 01:27:32,993
[SPEAKER_11]: It was like a big budget student project.

1353
01:27:33,613 --> 01:27:36,576
[SPEAKER_11]: It's crazy how kind of... I love the Team Rocket thing.

1354
01:27:38,017 --> 01:27:43,461
[SPEAKER_11]: The effects were good enough for sci-fi television because that's what the special effects look like.

1355
01:27:43,481 --> 01:27:45,723
[SPEAKER_11]: It was like the really bad Sharktopus kind of effects.

1356
01:27:46,843 --> 01:27:47,384
[SPEAKER_11]: That's awesome.

1357
01:27:47,704 --> 01:27:48,825
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, just saying.

1358
01:27:50,638 --> 01:27:56,360
[SPEAKER_11]: So this got me thinking here because, again, there's folks in chat talking about role-playing games and stuff.

1359
01:27:56,420 --> 01:27:58,301
[SPEAKER_11]: Salacious Pop is saying, you know what I really enjoyed?

1360
01:27:58,341 --> 01:28:01,062
[SPEAKER_11]: Final Fantasy Mystic Quest because I played it knowing it was kiddie.

1361
01:28:01,422 --> 01:28:03,363
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, that game wasn't as terrible as everybody outmade it to be.

1362
01:28:03,383 --> 01:28:05,123
[SPEAKER_11]: It just wasn't Final Fantasy, just like XI.

1363
01:28:06,384 --> 01:28:10,425
[SPEAKER_11]: But actually, I think DarkSakura might be onto something with the role-playing game of the month.

1364
01:28:10,545 --> 01:28:11,486
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I have an idea.

1365
01:28:11,726 --> 01:28:12,206
[SPEAKER_11]: What do you guys think?

1366
01:28:12,606 --> 01:28:19,789
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, we pick a role-playing game, like a classic of some sort, that we would see who can get the furthest in like a month.

1367
01:28:21,178 --> 01:28:21,638
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura.com

1368
01:28:51,810 --> 01:28:53,611
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, sometimes they do, actually.

1369
01:28:54,492 --> 01:28:56,513
[SPEAKER_11]: Whoa.

1370
01:28:56,593 --> 01:29:04,518
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe we should just pick one night where we've got nothing going on and do the Zelda Fest.

1371
01:29:06,719 --> 01:29:06,880
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

1372
01:29:07,020 --> 01:29:09,121
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I was talking about role-playing, not Zelda Fest.

1373
01:29:09,141 --> 01:29:10,021
[SPEAKER_11]: Quit trying to change the subject.

1374
01:29:10,041 --> 01:29:10,422
[SPEAKER_14]: No, no, no.

1375
01:29:10,682 --> 01:29:13,584
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like the Zelda Fest, where you see who can get the furthest.

1376
01:29:14,584 --> 01:29:16,185
[SPEAKER_11]: Ah, okay, okay.

1377
01:29:16,205 --> 01:29:17,266
[SPEAKER_14]: By a certain time limit.

1378
01:29:18,007 --> 01:29:18,948
[SPEAKER_11]: We could do something like that.

1379
01:29:18,968 --> 01:29:19,830
[SPEAKER_11]: It could be interesting.

1380
01:29:19,850 --> 01:29:20,410
[SPEAKER_11]: It would be fun.

1381
01:29:20,611 --> 01:29:25,437
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to be still playing Damn Plants vs. Zombies because I recognize the music because it plays in my sleep now.

1382
01:29:27,051 --> 01:29:31,413
[SPEAKER_11]: and SSJ100 Matt says this will happen when Rob and Jamie actually play their magic card battle.

1383
01:29:31,433 --> 01:29:32,654
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah, that was like a year ago, right?

1384
01:29:34,695 --> 01:29:35,676
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I found them recently.

1385
01:29:35,716 --> 01:29:36,456
[SPEAKER_14]: Magic.

1386
01:29:36,997 --> 01:29:37,277
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

1387
01:29:37,337 --> 01:29:38,157
[SPEAKER_14]: I have two sealed decks.

1388
01:29:38,818 --> 01:29:40,098
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me get back into some quick news here.

1389
01:29:40,699 --> 01:29:44,020
[SPEAKER_11]: This is news that makes me very happy and I know it'll make Loki very, very happy.

1390
01:29:44,121 --> 01:29:50,124
[SPEAKER_11]: Rumors abound once again that Capcom is indeed working on a new Mega Man Legends game.

1391
01:29:51,305 --> 01:29:52,105
[SPEAKER_11]: As they should be

1392
01:30:20,646 --> 01:30:22,107
[SPEAKER_11]: The Shadow The Shadow

1393
01:30:39,560 --> 01:30:41,962
[SPEAKER_11]: and you have to trust The Shadow because Alec Baldwin played him.

1394
01:30:42,022 --> 01:30:42,142
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

1395
01:30:42,663 --> 01:30:48,588
[SPEAKER_11]: But The Shadow also pegged the release date of Mega Man 9 and some of the very specific details in the game.

1396
01:30:48,708 --> 01:30:51,190
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's somebody who has kind of done this before.

1397
01:30:51,610 --> 01:30:52,351
[SPEAKER_11]: So who knows?

1398
01:30:52,971 --> 01:30:53,732
[SPEAKER_11]: Could be very cool.

1399
01:30:54,533 --> 01:30:55,073
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm excited.

1400
01:30:55,133 --> 01:30:56,054
[SPEAKER_11]: I would love to see.

1401
01:30:57,135 --> 01:31:05,682
[SPEAKER_11]: Kind of something we didn't get to tonight but I know had been floating around out there was a Mega Man Doom mod that made Doom look like Mega Man Legends kind of.

1402
01:31:05,862 --> 01:31:07,463
[SPEAKER_11]: It was actually kind of awesome I have to admit.

1403
01:31:07,483 --> 01:31:08,124
[SPEAKER_15]: So dorky.

1404
01:31:08,564 --> 01:31:13,866
[SPEAKER_11]: So we have, let's see, when the Kinect comes out, we're going to have Dance Masters from Konami.

1405
01:31:13,886 --> 01:31:16,747
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to have Dance Central from Harmonix.

1406
01:31:17,027 --> 01:31:17,568
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, guess what?

1407
01:31:17,668 --> 01:31:21,069
[SPEAKER_11]: Overseas, they're getting a game called Dance Paradise in Europe.

1408
01:31:21,529 --> 01:31:24,430
[SPEAKER_11]: It's coming from Mindscape and Universal Music.

1409
01:31:25,150 --> 01:31:26,611
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going to be coming out when the Kinect comes out.

1410
01:31:26,671 --> 01:31:28,132
[SPEAKER_11]: No word on a release over here.

1411
01:31:28,752 --> 01:31:34,294
[SPEAKER_11]: But just to give you kind of a heads up on what to expect in this game, since it is a partnership with Universal Music...

1412
01:31:34,694 --> 01:31:36,396
[SPEAKER_11]: You do have some pretty big names in this.

1413
01:31:36,716 --> 01:31:39,679
[SPEAKER_11]: For instance, David Guetta and Kelly Rowland, When Love Takes Over.

1414
01:31:40,120 --> 01:31:41,701
[SPEAKER_11]: Gwen Stefani, What You Waiting For.

1415
01:31:42,082 --> 01:31:43,603
[SPEAKER_11]: Lady Gaga, Bad Romance.

1416
01:31:43,743 --> 01:31:44,904
[SPEAKER_11]: LaRue, Bulletproof.

1417
01:31:45,345 --> 01:31:46,866
[SPEAKER_11]: MC Hammer, Can't Touch This.

1418
01:31:47,347 --> 01:31:48,628
[SPEAKER_11]: No Doubt, Hey Baby.

1419
01:31:50,410 --> 01:31:55,935
[SPEAKER_06]: I love that all of those songs were in the last few months and then MC Hammer with Can't Touch This from 30 years ago.

1420
01:31:56,496 --> 01:31:57,337
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's a classic.

1421
01:31:57,857 --> 01:32:04,702
[SPEAKER_11]: Sophie Ellis-Bexter with Murder on the Dance Floor and the Doctor's favorite song, Jerry Halliwell with It's Raining Men.

1422
01:32:04,882 --> 01:32:08,545
[SPEAKER_11]: Remember, MC Hammer needs money.

1423
01:32:09,825 --> 01:32:14,769
[SPEAKER_11]: But then I'm looking at screenshots of the game and I'm kind of like, oh, this looks like it's going to be kind of a cheap hack of a game.

1424
01:32:14,849 --> 01:32:15,269
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

1425
01:32:15,569 --> 01:32:17,491
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if it looks really that good.

1426
01:32:17,831 --> 01:32:23,115
[SPEAKER_11]: But the song list is pretty darn good because they did team up with Universal Music.

1427
01:32:23,215 --> 01:32:24,375
[SPEAKER_11]: So, yeah.

1428
01:32:25,356 --> 01:32:28,238
[SPEAKER_11]: So 20 of the 40 songs have been announced so far.

1429
01:32:28,358 --> 01:32:30,419
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, I don't know.

1430
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:32,261
[SPEAKER_11]: Interested to see more in that.

1431
01:32:32,861 --> 01:32:34,222
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, one other story.

1432
01:32:34,582 --> 01:32:38,705
[SPEAKER_11]: There's rumors going around this week that Project Milo was canceled this week.

1433
01:32:39,906 --> 01:32:42,227
[SPEAKER_11]: 19 contractors that were working on the project were let go.

1434
01:32:42,628 --> 01:32:47,951
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of the other people that were on the project are going to be using the technology in a new Fable-themed Kinect game.

1435
01:32:48,231 --> 01:32:52,414
[SPEAKER_09]: When your game doesn't have a title, it's probably not going to come out yet.

1436
01:32:52,434 --> 01:32:53,435
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1437
01:32:53,875 --> 01:32:54,456
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1438
01:33:21,198 --> 01:33:22,059
[SPEAKER_14]: I got some stuff!

1439
01:33:22,699 --> 01:33:23,340
[SPEAKER_14]: How about Rock Band?

1440
01:33:24,280 --> 01:33:29,564
[SPEAKER_14]: We have the download content coming out that will be a lot of Anthrax.

1441
01:33:29,845 --> 01:33:30,465
[SPEAKER_14]: Woohoo!

1442
01:33:30,485 --> 01:33:31,686
[SPEAKER_14]: I love Anthrax.

1443
01:33:32,427 --> 01:33:40,633
[SPEAKER_14]: So the Anthrax pack will be Among the Living, I'm the Man, Indians, Madhouse, which I love that song, and Metal Thrashing Mad.

1444
01:33:41,173 --> 01:33:43,575
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually the later two are live versions.

1445
01:33:44,156 --> 01:33:45,697
[SPEAKER_14]: And the whole pack will be 680 Microsoft points.

1446
01:33:47,418 --> 01:33:48,839
[SPEAKER_14]: for individual tracks coming out.

1447
01:33:49,259 --> 01:33:50,979
[SPEAKER_14]: Stuff, again, that I have to get.

1448
01:33:51,780 --> 01:33:55,601
[SPEAKER_14]: My Chemical Romance, I'm Not Okay, and Welcome to the Black Parade.

1449
01:33:56,041 --> 01:33:57,342
[SPEAKER_14]: Totally, totally want both of those.

1450
01:33:58,102 --> 01:34:04,565
[SPEAKER_14]: 30 Seconds to Mars, Closer to the Edge, Atreyu, Cough and Nails, Buckcherry, Out of Line, and two Doobie Brothers tracks.

1451
01:34:04,625 --> 01:34:06,045
[SPEAKER_14]: Listen to the music in Long Train Runnin'.

1452
01:34:06,865 --> 01:34:08,846
[SPEAKER_11]: I still can't believe there's a band called Atreyu.

1453
01:34:10,667 --> 01:34:12,448
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a band called Ludo.

1454
01:34:13,788 --> 01:34:14,328
[SPEAKER_14]: That's awesome.

1455
01:34:14,708 --> 01:34:15,869
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, and they're pretty cool.

1456
01:34:17,191 --> 01:34:20,115
[SPEAKER_14]: So as far as other stuff, how about Cave Story?

1457
01:34:21,117 --> 01:34:26,023
[SPEAKER_14]: There is going to be a DSiWare and what?

1458
01:34:26,464 --> 01:34:27,145
[SPEAKER_14]: I heard a gasp.

1459
01:34:27,445 --> 01:34:29,128
[SPEAKER_06]: I like Cave Story and that looks really cool.

1460
01:34:29,348 --> 01:34:33,694
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that a screenshot that we're looking at here that's a cool updated version of the Cave Story graphics on the screen?

1461
01:34:34,848 --> 01:34:48,643
[SPEAKER_14]: Basically, and actually, yeah, this picture was commissioned in honor of the announcement, so I guess it's maybe an idea of what it might be like.

1462
01:34:49,584 --> 01:34:54,609
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, but at any rate, um, it's going to be a DSiWare, uh, version of the game.

1463
01:34:55,430 --> 01:34:58,653
[SPEAKER_14]: And it will, they say it's done, they're just testing it.

1464
01:34:59,474 --> 01:35:06,882
[SPEAKER_14]: And, um, it's apparently going to, uh, have a, uh, classic one and, uh, an updated one.

1465
01:35:06,922 --> 01:35:06,982
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh.

1466
01:35:08,463 --> 01:35:12,806
[SPEAKER_14]: and then, last but not least, Donkey Kong Country for Wii.

1467
01:35:13,587 --> 01:35:21,913
[SPEAKER_14]: It's called Donkey Kong Country Returns and it comes with a banana pocket for your, it's like a condom for your condom, for your Wii.

1468
01:35:23,781 --> 01:35:28,305
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, it comes with this banana thing that you can put your Wiimote into.

1469
01:35:28,986 --> 01:35:31,528
[SPEAKER_14]: So, double banana?

1470
01:35:31,588 --> 01:35:32,649
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a banana pouch.

1471
01:35:34,551 --> 01:35:37,494
[SPEAKER_14]: I just keep thinking maybe I'm just dirty.

1472
01:35:37,514 --> 01:35:38,115
[SPEAKER_09]: Banana hammock?

1473
01:35:40,978 --> 01:35:41,979
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a penis joke!

1474
01:35:45,118 --> 01:36:03,555
[SPEAKER_14]: at any rate if you pre-order it you get beta access and downloadable skins and the bananas are probably limited edition should be out on November 21st like anyone gives a crap okay I'll probably get it because you just like to have more stuff I want a banana

1475
01:36:04,844 --> 01:36:06,065
[SPEAKER_11]: Twitter Topics

[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, does this surprise you?

1485
01:36:46,998 --> 01:36:49,278
[SPEAKER_06]: No, because I haven't been to Blockbuster in months.

1486
01:36:49,318 --> 01:36:50,759
[SPEAKER_06]: I have Netflix because it's the 21st century.

1488
01:37:13,829 --> 01:37:14,609
[SPEAKER_15]: A little bit, yeah.

1489
01:37:15,650 --> 01:37:19,211

[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see, Actdeft sends us a couple links here.

1491
01:37:23,713 --> 01:37:28,495
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, I guess one of them already got brought up because it's the Kirby thing, but there's another link here.

1492
01:37:29,455 --> 01:37:34,057
[SPEAKER_11]: He's linking us to an article on Kotaku called How to Hump an Xbox 360.

[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1494

01:37:45,667 --> 01:37:46,127
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow.

1498
01:37:54,390 --> 01:37:56,051
[SPEAKER_11]: Spoiler alert, you drill a hole in it.

1499
01:37:58,852 --> 01:37:59,372
[SPEAKER_15]: Huh.

1500
01:38:00,573 --> 01:38:00,953
[SPEAKER_15]: I see.

[SPEAKER_09]: Really, that's all the instructions.

1503
01:38:04,197 --> 01:38:07,041
[SPEAKER_09]: Drill hole, add handlebar for some reason.

1504
01:38:08,402 --> 01:38:09,304
[SPEAKER_09]: You gotta hold on.

1505
01:38:12,889 --> 01:38:15,793
[SPEAKER_06]: I seriously want to see a YouTube video of somebody actually doing this.

1506
01:38:15,953 --> 01:38:16,373
[SPEAKER_11]: I do not.

1507
01:38:17,574 --> 01:38:19,095
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkKeysK sends us a tweet.

1508
01:38:19,215 --> 01:38:22,317
[SPEAKER_11]: Medal of Honor PC Open Beta starts October 4th.

01:38:40,505 --> 01:38:42,086
[SPEAKER_11]: It runs October 4th through 7th.

1514
01:38:43,927 --> 01:38:45,448
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm trying to see how you get into this.

1515
01:38:48,911 --> 01:38:49,771
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, that's the developer.

1516
01:38:49,811 --> 01:38:50,131
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry.

1517
01:38:50,151 --> 01:38:51,672
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought that was like a convention or something.

1518
01:38:51,712 --> 01:38:53,032
[SPEAKER_11]: I've heard that used before with that.

1519
01:38:53,412 --> 01:38:59,653
[SPEAKER_11]: But anyhow, yeah, a comment from... Sorry, I haven't read the story in advance.

1520
01:38:59,673 --> 01:39:00,454
[SPEAKER_11]: It was coming on Twitter.

1521
01:39:01,334 --> 01:39:11,316
[SPEAKER_11]: A comment from EA Games President Frank Guilbeau says, quote, We also hope that by offering the multiplayer open beta, we can clear up any misunderstanding about the patriotism and respect that...

1522
01:39:12,257 --> 01:39:13,958
[SPEAKER_11]: They are the foundation of this game.

1523
01:39:14,118 --> 01:39:18,021
[SPEAKER_11]: Medal of Honor franchise has always shown extraordinary reverence for American and allied soldiers.

1524
01:39:18,461 --> 01:39:19,902
[SPEAKER_11]: This game is no exception.

1525
01:39:20,823 --> 01:39:24,046
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you like those war games, you're going to have a blast with this one.

01:39:24,246 --> 01:39:24,526
[SPEAKER_11]: Get it?

1527
01:39:27,441 --> 01:39:32,709
[SPEAKER_11]: TigerClaw sends his tweet, raving rabbits to become a live action CGI TV show.

1528
01:39:33,550 --> 01:39:34,011
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow.

1529
01:39:34,612 --> 01:39:34,952
[SPEAKER_15]: I hate them.

1530
01:39:35,033 --> 01:39:36,274
[SPEAKER_11]: I hate them so much.

1531
01:39:37,156 --> 01:39:39,299
[SPEAKER_11]: No, apparently it's really happening.

1532
01:39:39,339 --> 01:39:41,623
[SPEAKER_11]: It's coming from Ardman Animation.

01:39:48,611 --> 01:39:53,977
[SPEAKER_11]: TigerClaw also sends us a link that is a little more stateside about that whole Wii Remote Plus thing going on.

1537
01:39:54,618 --> 01:39:56,881
[SPEAKER_11]: Apparently November 7th is the date they're looking at.

1538
01:39:57,381 --> 01:39:58,082
[SPEAKER_11]: So, interesting.

1539
01:40:02,206 --> 01:40:04,028
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkTsuke sent us another tweet here.

1540
01:40:04,288 --> 01:40:05,969
[SPEAKER_11]: FPS vs. RTS players.

1541
01:40:06,029 --> 01:40:09,472
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't played in a while, but it's a pretty great game to unite gamers.

1542
01:40:09,573 --> 01:40:13,916
[SPEAKER_11]: Battleswarm.net I don't want to visit it live on air because I don't want to break the show computer.

1543
01:40:13,936 --> 01:40:17,479
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know how intensive this site is, but I guess he's throwing out a plug for that website.

1544
01:40:19,041 --> 01:40:25,985
[SPEAKER_11]: Matt, SJ100Matt is sending us a tweet saying, Remember Bobby Blackwolf's listless idea for a gun con dating sim?

1545
01:40:26,565 --> 01:40:31,208
[SPEAKER_11]: Sounds like someone stole his idea and got linked to this gal gun.

1546
01:40:31,288 --> 01:40:34,190
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the Xbox 360's shooter.

1547
01:40:35,311 --> 01:40:35,731
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow.

1548
01:40:36,612 --> 01:40:40,474
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, it does look like a gun shooting dating game.

1549
01:40:40,554 --> 01:40:41,675
[SPEAKER_11]: There's actually a little video here.

1550
01:40:41,715 --> 01:40:42,736
[SPEAKER_15]: What kind of gun?

1551
01:40:44,877 --> 01:40:46,999
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see if we can look at a little clip here of the video.

1552
01:40:47,839 --> 01:40:49,921
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, so you're shooting the women that you want to date.

1553
01:40:50,241 --> 01:40:50,841
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, brilliant.

1554
01:40:50,901 --> 01:40:52,242
[SPEAKER_11]: I think you're rescuing them.

1555
01:40:53,543 --> 01:40:55,484
[SPEAKER_11]: With your love juices that you're shooting at them.

1556
01:40:58,827 --> 01:41:01,989
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, no, looks like you're shooting her boobies.

1557
01:41:02,749 --> 01:41:05,331
[SPEAKER_06]: You're rescuing them from not having an orgasm.

1558
01:41:05,351 --> 01:41:10,154
[SPEAKER_15]: You're rescuing them from their confining clothing.

1559
01:41:11,856 --> 01:41:13,217
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, you are shooting them with hearts.

1560
01:41:14,017 --> 01:41:14,277
[SPEAKER_13]: and Flower.

1561
01:41:27,791 --> 01:41:27,831
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

1562
01:41:27,851 --> 01:41:27,891
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

1563
01:41:56,997 --> 01:41:58,077
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a neat effect, though.

1564
01:41:58,837 --> 01:42:00,618
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just a perspective effect.

1565
01:42:01,218 --> 01:42:01,498
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what?

1566
01:42:01,518 --> 01:42:04,219
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a game on the iPad that kind of does that.

1567
01:42:04,359 --> 01:42:06,239
[SPEAKER_11]: It's Labyrinth or something like that.

1568
01:42:06,279 --> 01:42:07,400
[SPEAKER_11]: That's just screenshots.

1569
01:42:07,480 --> 01:42:08,020
[SPEAKER_11]: I've seen that.

1570
01:42:08,800 --> 01:42:10,400
[SPEAKER_11]: No, that's not like what the 3DS does.

1571
01:42:10,540 --> 01:42:11,261
[SPEAKER_11]: It is an app, though.

1572
01:42:11,381 --> 01:42:12,021
[SPEAKER_11]: It's neat, though.

1573
01:42:12,761 --> 01:42:13,981
[SPEAKER_14]: I have to share something, by the way.

1574
01:42:14,061 --> 01:42:14,261
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

1575
01:42:14,421 --> 01:42:15,382
[SPEAKER_14]: This comes from Tiara.

1576
01:42:15,582 --> 01:42:16,902
[SPEAKER_14]: It's about WoW, so you'll like it.

1577
01:42:17,262 --> 01:42:17,522
[SPEAKER_11]: Goody.

1578
01:42:18,422 --> 01:42:22,323
[SPEAKER_14]: That she ran into a level 60 Tauren druid named Harry Potter.

1579
01:42:23,043 --> 01:42:25,304
[SPEAKER_14]: H-A-I-R-Y-P-A-W-T-E-R.

1580
01:42:27,208 --> 01:42:28,349
[SPEAKER_11]: I like that she's playing WoW again.

1581
01:42:29,589 --> 01:42:30,229
[SPEAKER_11]: Come play with me.

1582
01:42:31,430 --> 01:42:33,770
[SPEAKER_11]: And then lastly from Leo Shen sends us a tweet.

1583
01:42:33,850 --> 01:42:37,111
[SPEAKER_11]: A new challenger approaches for BlazBlueCS2.

1584
01:42:37,191 --> 01:42:42,593
[SPEAKER_11]: She has kitty missiles and links us to a little YouTube here I guess where you can see this character in action.

1585
01:42:43,734 --> 01:42:45,414
[SPEAKER_10]: Come on, let's see the kitty missiles.

1586
01:42:45,434 --> 01:42:45,814
[SPEAKER_10]: Might be.

1587
01:43:01,451 --> 01:43:02,731
[SPEAKER_11]: Wait, did she just throw a cow?

1588
01:43:02,991 --> 01:43:03,652
[SPEAKER_11]: I think she did.

1589
01:43:04,692 --> 01:43:06,292
[SPEAKER_11]: I totally just saw a cow get thrown.

1590
01:43:06,632 --> 01:43:07,732
[SPEAKER_15]: What is this, Monty Python?

1591
01:43:07,853 --> 01:43:08,393
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess so.

1592
01:43:08,433 --> 01:43:10,153
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, that's going to do it for Twitter topics tonight.

1593
01:43:10,193 --> 01:43:15,434
[SPEAKER_11]: If you want to send us tweets in the future, twitter.com slash OLR is the place where you can follow us on Twitter.

1594
01:43:15,734 --> 01:43:19,795
[SPEAKER_11]: You should follow us on Twitter anyway, so that way we can tweet you with reminders about what's coming up with the show.

1595
01:43:20,095 --> 01:43:20,496
[SPEAKER_11]: Yay!

1596
01:43:21,156 --> 01:43:27,897
[SPEAKER_11]: And sometimes when we go to conventions and stuff, random things we will send out on Twitter as well, like pictures and all that cool stuff.

1597
01:43:28,457 --> 01:43:29,618
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, back into some more news.

1598
01:43:29,818 --> 01:43:30,698
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki, what do you got for us?

1599
01:43:32,432 --> 01:43:34,353
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got Plants vs. Zombies now.

1600
01:43:35,634 --> 01:43:45,520
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got some cool stuff, including... You may remember some of the things that Sony does to curb piracy and stuff.

1601
01:43:46,621 --> 01:43:57,107
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, now they've disabled... It's funny because everybody's joking, oh, now they have those USB mod chips, they're going to disable the USB ports.

1602
01:43:58,733 --> 01:44:00,454
[SPEAKER_09]: They weren't that far off.

1603
01:44:00,835 --> 01:44:08,239
[SPEAKER_09]: They've disabled some USB peripherals, I guess, according to a report that was on their website.

1604
01:44:08,980 --> 01:44:20,447
[SPEAKER_09]: The issue, I guess, they were disabling counterfeit PS3 controllers, but it was actually disabling unlicensed third-party controllers.

1605
01:44:22,189 --> 01:44:46,049
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of these devices affected by this actually were the Yobo PS3 Joybox, which I believe is an arcade stick, the XCM Cross Battle Plus adapter, which was kind of an adapter that allowed you to use an Xbox 360 controller on the PlayStation 3, and the Splitfish FragFX, which is kind of a hybrid controller and mouse adapter.

1606
01:44:46,349 --> 01:44:48,890
[SPEAKER_09]: and that's kind of lame.

1607
01:44:49,250 --> 01:44:51,491
[SPEAKER_09]: That's part of firmware 3.5.

1608
01:44:52,451 --> 01:45:01,774
[SPEAKER_09]: Other things though that it kind of broke as well, some old Mad Catz controllers, even though they are fully licensed, apparently they are now broken.

1609
01:45:01,834 --> 01:45:14,838
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you own the 2008 wireless PS3 gamepad or the 2008 wired PS3 gamepad or the PS3 wireless MicroCon, which is now discontinued, they do not work anymore.

1610
01:45:15,618 --> 01:45:15,878
[SPEAKER_11]: Dope.

1611
01:45:16,869 --> 01:45:21,231
[SPEAKER_11]: So, um... Man, if I were Mad Catz, I would be pissed.

1612
01:45:21,531 --> 01:45:22,191
[SPEAKER_11]: I would be pissed.

1613
01:45:22,251 --> 01:45:23,531
[SPEAKER_11]: Especially if they're licensed.

1614
01:45:23,571 --> 01:45:26,532
[SPEAKER_11]: If they're unlicensed, well then, too bad, so sad, right?

1615
01:45:26,872 --> 01:45:31,074
[SPEAKER_11]: But if they're licensed, that's grounds to sue and stuff.

1616
01:45:31,934 --> 01:45:32,695
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, Sue and...

1617
01:45:56,235 --> 01:46:00,956
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know about you, but I haven't heard of some big ol' mass problem with counterfeit controllers.

1618
01:46:02,037 --> 01:46:07,318
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know people out there going, oh man, all those counterfeit controllers out there, I just can't find a good PS3 controller.

1619
01:46:08,959 --> 01:46:11,199
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, there are a lot of shitty controllers out there, actually.

1620
01:46:11,699 --> 01:46:14,080
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but these are actually counterfeit controllers.

1621
01:46:14,100 --> 01:46:21,962
[SPEAKER_09]: There was a YouTube that was on Kotaku as well, where someone actually bought a cheap DualShock 3 controller that was a counterfeit.

1622
01:46:23,573 --> 01:46:44,547
[SPEAKER_09]: so you know that's kind of lame that those are out there but I mean I can't imagine this is a huge problem that one that warrants a software update I mean hell I can think of a lot of problems that this console has that haven't been fixed with a software update like home being lame nice

1623
01:46:45,908 --> 01:46:49,310
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, well, how would you like to get free Microsoft Points?

1624
01:46:49,751 --> 01:46:51,312
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right, free Microsoft Points.

1625
01:46:51,332 --> 01:46:51,812
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, guess what?

1626
01:46:51,832 --> 01:46:54,834
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a website that will bribe you with free Microsoft Points.

1627
01:46:55,335 --> 01:46:58,397
[SPEAKER_11]: They're keeping it in the family because that website is Bing.

1628
01:46:58,777 --> 01:47:01,199
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right, Microsoft Search Engine, the rival to Google.

1629
01:47:01,299 --> 01:47:07,343
[SPEAKER_11]: Bing is running this new little Bing toolbar that you can install on your browser.

1630
01:47:08,163 --> 01:47:08,564
[SPEAKER_11]: By the way...

1631
01:47:09,704 --> 01:47:17,310
[SPEAKER_11]: The first announcement said that it was only compatible with Internet Explorer, but some things I've been reading in forum chats and stuff say that it actually works with Firefox.

1632
01:47:17,630 --> 01:47:23,534
[SPEAKER_11]: It would make sense that it would only work with Internet Explorer, that whole Microsoft-only stuff.

1633
01:47:24,555 --> 01:47:33,502
[SPEAKER_11]: But anyhow, if you use it to take part in daily promotions or do searching, you will earn reward points that you can then turn into Microsoft points.

1634
01:47:34,142 --> 01:47:38,446
[SPEAKER_11]: So here's the thing though, you can only get the Microsoft points in 100 point denominations.

1635
01:47:38,967 --> 01:47:42,991
[SPEAKER_11]: But just installing the tool bar gets you 250 points, so that's kind of cool I guess.

1636
01:47:44,492 --> 01:47:54,902
[SPEAKER_11]: What I'm also hearing though, again reading through comments and things, is apparently they will only send you the points in cards in the mail.

1637
01:47:55,702 --> 01:47:55,903
[SPEAKER_12]: Mm-hmm.

1638
01:47:55,923 --> 01:47:56,043
[SPEAKER_12]: Mm-hmm.

1639
01:48:14,600 --> 01:48:15,981
[SPEAKER_15]: They're trying all kinds of stuff.

1640
01:48:34,742 --> 01:48:35,042
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura.com

1641
01:48:51,380 --> 01:49:01,246
[SPEAKER_14]: Their application on... Did it... Oh, no, did it... It made me... I was trying to click cancel and I clicked the other thing, so now it closed all my windows.

1642
01:49:01,326 --> 01:49:03,768
[SPEAKER_11]: Great, and it means you closed your next story, didn't it?

1643
01:49:03,788 --> 01:49:05,009
[SPEAKER_11]: Yay.

1644
01:49:05,029 --> 01:49:05,189
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1645
01:49:05,969 --> 01:49:06,730
[SPEAKER_14]: Awesome.

1646
01:49:06,770 --> 01:49:07,330
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, well.

1647
01:49:08,291 --> 01:49:08,631
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, well.

1648
01:49:08,751 --> 01:49:09,312
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what?

1649
01:49:09,732 --> 01:49:11,293
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what I have an iPhone for.

1650
01:49:11,913 --> 01:49:13,434
[SPEAKER_11]: You're going to bring up stories on the iPhone?

1651
01:49:13,554 --> 01:49:13,955
[SPEAKER_11]: Why not?

1652
01:49:14,195 --> 01:49:16,096
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, well, I got to stretch for time here.

1653
01:49:16,136 --> 01:49:17,377
[SPEAKER_11]: I was ready to go on to the next story.

1654
01:49:17,757 --> 01:49:18,758
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, you know what, Rob?

1655
01:49:18,798 --> 01:49:20,720
[SPEAKER_14]: Sometimes things just don't go the way you expect them to.

1656
01:49:20,860 --> 01:49:22,141
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, don't be rude.

1657
01:49:22,421 --> 01:49:23,102
[SPEAKER_14]: I wasn't being rude.

1658
01:49:23,862 --> 01:49:24,723
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm a realist.

1659
01:49:24,843 --> 01:49:26,425
[SPEAKER_11]: Bing has pretty pictures on it.

1660
01:49:26,665 --> 01:49:28,326
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what I like about Bing when you go to their website.

1661
01:49:28,606 --> 01:49:30,888
[SPEAKER_11]: And the iPhone app is actually kind of neat.

1662
01:49:30,988 --> 01:49:31,949
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't have an iPhone.

1663
01:49:32,089 --> 01:49:32,330
[SPEAKER_11]: Really?

1664
01:49:32,370 --> 01:49:33,290
[SPEAKER_11]: Would you like to touch mine?

1665
01:49:33,531 --> 01:49:33,731
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

1666
01:49:33,751 --> 01:49:34,371
[SPEAKER_15]: I would.

1667
01:49:34,391 --> 01:49:36,173
[SPEAKER_15]: It's got your finger juice on it.

1668
01:49:37,434 --> 01:49:37,854
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, you may.

1669
01:49:37,874 --> 01:49:38,275
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, my God.

1670
01:49:39,750 --> 01:49:40,851
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, I have my story.

1671
01:49:41,331 --> 01:49:41,651
[SPEAKER_14]: Yay.

1672
01:49:41,851 --> 01:49:42,192
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

1673
01:49:42,492 --> 01:49:45,834
[SPEAKER_14]: Because this is the joy of the iPhone.

1674
01:49:46,695 --> 01:49:47,715
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh great, now it's not loading.

1675
01:49:49,436 --> 01:49:49,837
[SPEAKER_11]: Sucker.

1676
01:49:49,917 --> 01:49:58,902
[SPEAKER_14]: Miyamoto, basically what the story is about is that Miyamoto has always considered the maker of the Rubik's Cube, Mr. Rubik himself, to be his rival.

1677
01:50:00,303 --> 01:50:05,827
[SPEAKER_14]: So he wants to make something along the lines of a Rubik's Cube as his big pet project.

1678
01:50:05,927 --> 01:50:09,049
[SPEAKER_11]: So like selling a bazillion Wii's isn't good enough?

1679
01:50:09,690 --> 01:50:09,830
[SPEAKER_14]: Nope.

1680
01:50:12,291 --> 01:50:22,215
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, basically, he said, and I'm going to quote, For quite some time, I have viewed Professor Rubik, who created the Rubik's Cube, as a sort of rival.

1681
01:50:22,295 --> 01:50:25,096
[SPEAKER_14]: I've always thought it would be cool to create something like a Rubik's Cube.

1682
01:50:25,617 --> 01:50:27,157
[SPEAKER_14]: I've told lots of people about that.

1683
01:50:27,237 --> 01:50:33,080
[SPEAKER_14]: For 20 years, I've always thought that the Rubik's Cubes are great, and I wanted to make something like that, but I still haven't tried to do.

1684
01:50:33,640 --> 01:50:35,160
[SPEAKER_14]: So I must be taking it easy.

1685
01:50:36,141 --> 01:50:36,441
[SPEAKER_14]: Wow.

1686
01:50:36,461 --> 01:50:36,521
[SPEAKER_14]: Wow.

1687
01:50:38,385 --> 01:50:54,564
[SPEAKER_11]: and then he said he wanted to be a manga artist oh he just wants to do everything doesn't he you know what he's created some of the most memorable video game characters ever like that history will never forget some of these video game characters and yet it's just not good enough for him

1688
01:50:55,071 --> 01:50:55,251
[SPEAKER_14]: No?

1689
01:50:55,871 --> 01:51:05,277
[SPEAKER_14]: And, well, he was, um, said that he, uh, did some, uh, comic strips for, um, Tezuka, who's the Nintendo EAD general manager.

1690
01:51:05,537 --> 01:51:08,438
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, wait, what, which characters are you talking about that he created?

1691
01:51:08,838 --> 01:51:12,120
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, you know, the ones that we would never forget, was that like Captain Rainbow or something?

1692
01:51:14,181 --> 01:51:15,442
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you remember Captain Rainbow?

1693
01:51:15,922 --> 01:51:18,184
[SPEAKER_11]: Good point from, uh, DarkTetsuya in chatroom.

1694
01:51:18,864 --> 01:51:21,785
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, didn't Nintendo used to make toys and stuff back in the 70s?

1695
01:51:22,226 --> 01:51:24,527
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, Nintendo started off as a Hanafuda card.

1696
01:51:24,861 --> 01:51:25,382
[SPEAKER_11]: Game & Watch

1697
01:51:40,703 --> 01:51:42,786
[SPEAKER_14]: Probably the rest of the steampunk outfit on my avatar.

1698
01:51:45,829 --> 01:51:46,270
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1699
01:51:47,071 --> 01:51:47,932
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki, it's your turn.

1700
01:51:48,012 --> 01:51:50,515
[SPEAKER_11]: You got to put down plants versus zombies and actually do a story.

1701
01:51:50,535 --> 01:51:51,396
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, I can do this.

1702
01:51:53,138 --> 01:51:58,244
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's other Sony news, and this would kind of tie in with the stuff that happened.

1703
01:51:59,125 --> 01:52:10,390
[SPEAKER_09]: Before, when they were removing things to stop hacking, remember they removed the other OS feature on the PlayStation 3 to stop the hacking of the system via Linux?

1704
01:52:10,911 --> 01:52:16,433
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, apparently there was a class action lawsuit filed against Sony because of that.

1705
01:52:17,254 --> 01:52:21,956
[SPEAKER_09]: And Sony has now filed a motion to dismiss that class action lawsuit brought against the company.

1706
01:52:22,676 --> 01:52:26,298
[SPEAKER_09]: And sadly enough, I kind of agree with them because, well...

1707
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:36,902
[SPEAKER_09]: Fails to present evidence that the company overtly advertised the other OS and its marketing campaigns on the PS3 packaging

1708
01:52:49,506 --> 01:52:53,611
[SPEAKER_09]: Sony also claims that the PS3 warranty license agreement and the PlayStation Network Terms of Service specifically provide

1709
01:53:06,428 --> 01:53:24,506
[SPEAKER_09]: PS3 purchasers with a licensed non-ownership interest in the software and use of the PlayStation Network provided that Sony has the right to disable or alter software features or terminate or limit the access to the PlayStation Network by issuing firmware updates.

1710
01:53:25,046 --> 01:53:26,928
[SPEAKER_09]: And also I guess that

1711
01:53:28,597 --> 01:53:29,057
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, gee.

1712
01:53:29,178 --> 01:53:34,620
[SPEAKER_09]: So, in other words, they're saying you can access this feature by disabling a different feature instead.

1713
01:53:45,720 --> 01:53:46,060
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1714
01:53:46,080 --> 01:53:47,461
[SPEAKER_11]: Tricky.

1715
01:53:47,702 --> 01:54:00,212
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, they're saying that because some of the... They should dismiss the suit because some of the plaintiffs did not use the other OS feature.

1716
01:54:00,712 --> 01:54:10,760
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, there was... Didn't use it in the same way, I guess, or just didn't use it at all because they have ways of checking that.

1717
01:54:11,421 --> 01:54:12,982
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, I guess...

1718
01:54:14,505 --> 01:54:16,009
[SPEAKER_09]: They wouldn't really have been affected by it.

1719
01:54:16,390 --> 01:54:19,639
[SPEAKER_09]: It's some people, I think, doing a money grab, if you ask me.

1720
01:54:21,690 --> 01:54:26,273
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure some people are just like that earlier story we had about APB and all the people complaining to EA.

1721
01:54:26,313 --> 01:54:29,556
[SPEAKER_11]: I bet there's some people that are going to go try to get money that really didn't even play APB.

1722
01:54:29,596 --> 01:54:30,157
[SPEAKER_11]: They just bought it.

1723
01:54:30,217 --> 01:54:31,838
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's different though.

1724
01:54:31,898 --> 01:54:34,520
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, they'd have proof of purchase of APB.

1725
01:54:34,540 --> 01:54:37,322
[SPEAKER_09]: They'd give them the serial number or something like that and they'd approve of that.

1726
01:54:38,043 --> 01:54:42,646
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a little different than saying, oh, you know, I...

1727
01:54:44,042 --> 01:54:44,382
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1728
01:54:44,422 --> 01:54:49,144
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, for example, a class action lawsuit that I was part of just because I hate 24 Hour Fitness.

1729
01:54:50,285 --> 01:54:59,089
[SPEAKER_09]: I canceled my 24 Hour Fitness membership and there was a class action lawsuit saying that there was people affected by the fact that when you cancel your membership, they bill you a couple more times.

1730
01:55:00,109 --> 01:55:00,429
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?

1731
01:55:00,849 --> 01:55:01,110
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1732
01:55:01,370 --> 01:55:02,030
[SPEAKER_11]: Did that happen to you?

1733
01:55:02,350 --> 01:55:03,090
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it didn't happen to me.

1734
01:55:03,451 --> 01:55:06,112
[SPEAKER_09]: But I still got... A $5 check?

1735
01:55:06,192 --> 01:55:08,413
[SPEAKER_09]: I got a three month pass to 24 Hour Fitness.

1736
01:55:08,453 --> 01:55:10,214
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, ooh, garbage!

1737
01:55:10,354 --> 01:55:10,934
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you!

1738
01:55:11,374 --> 01:55:13,015
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, oh, wonderful.

1739
01:55:13,515 --> 01:55:17,197
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't wait to go back to the gym I don't like going to.

1740
01:55:17,437 --> 01:55:17,977
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1741
01:55:17,997 --> 01:55:21,139
[SPEAKER_09]: This is way better than any other compensation you could possibly provide me.

1742
01:55:21,339 --> 01:55:21,579
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice.

1743
01:55:22,479 --> 01:55:22,879
[SPEAKER_11]: Very nice.

1744
01:55:22,939 --> 01:55:25,901
[SPEAKER_09]: At least I should be able to kick them in the pants or something.

1745
01:55:25,941 --> 01:55:32,464
[SPEAKER_11]: Going to our chat room at chat.orangelandradio.com for such eloquent comments, such as the one from Toagak, who says, Sony can suck a dick.

1746
01:55:32,624 --> 01:55:33,765
[SPEAKER_11]: What they did was wrong.

1747
01:55:34,465 --> 01:55:35,766
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you agree, Rice Princess?

1748
01:55:35,786 --> 01:55:36,666
[SPEAKER_11]: Can Sony suck a dick?

1749
01:55:38,280 --> 01:55:48,663
[SPEAKER_11]: Derek H in our chatroom says that's like a car company removing your seatbelts because you didn't use them.

1750
01:55:49,583 --> 01:55:51,244
[SPEAKER_11]: That's actually a pretty good comparison.

1751
01:55:51,624 --> 01:55:55,985
[SPEAKER_11]: Except for the fact that I don't think the other OS is going to save your life.

1752
01:55:56,385 --> 01:55:57,185
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe it could.

1753
01:55:57,406 --> 01:55:58,986
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess anything's possible.

1754
01:55:59,420 --> 01:56:00,780
[SPEAKER_15]: Don't make assumptions, Rob.

1755
01:56:00,800 --> 01:56:01,881
[SPEAKER_15]: You never know.

1756
01:56:04,742 --> 01:56:08,703
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, going on to more stories in our show here.

1757
01:56:09,683 --> 01:56:13,205
[SPEAKER_11]: Another rumor going around, and this is about more 3D games.

1758
01:56:14,325 --> 01:56:14,965
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh boy.

1759
01:56:15,245 --> 01:56:15,805
[SPEAKER_11]: I know, right?

1760
01:56:15,845 --> 01:56:17,026
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm already over it.

1761
01:56:18,311 --> 01:56:26,535
[SPEAKER_11]: But apparently there are yet more rumored ports of PlayStation 2 games being remade for the PlayStation 3 and in 3D.

1762
01:56:27,095 --> 01:56:28,956
[SPEAKER_11]: One of them, I've got to admit, sounds really interesting.

1763
01:56:28,996 --> 01:56:31,857
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the Mortal Kombat HD arcade collection.

1764
01:56:32,437 --> 01:56:41,001
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you're looking at sample box art that's out there, it's Mortal Kombat 1, 2, and Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 kind of redone in HD.

1765
01:56:41,641 --> 01:56:46,744
[SPEAKER_11]: I've got to admit, being that I love the cheesy Mortal Kombat games from back in the day, that actually sounds kind of awesome.

1766
01:56:46,784 --> 01:56:47,544
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not going to lie.

1767
01:56:48,004 --> 01:56:55,230
[SPEAKER_11]: Being able to, you know, play that in 3D Well, I wouldn't play in 3D, but HD and all that jazz Not interested in Rice Princess?

1768
01:56:55,890 --> 01:56:57,912
[SPEAKER_15]: Not especially You don't like Mortal Kombat?

1769
01:56:58,252 --> 01:57:00,594
[SPEAKER_15]: It's alright, I can play it in it's normal form

1770
01:57:01,352 --> 01:57:01,953
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, that's true.

1771
01:57:03,774 --> 01:57:12,741
[SPEAKER_11]: Apparently, it's going to have stereoscopic 3D support, and this is being reported by a French gaming website, but they have box art to go with it, and I don't know.

1772
01:57:12,861 --> 01:57:13,362
[SPEAKER_11]: It's coming out.

1773
01:57:14,583 --> 01:57:14,723
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh.

1774
01:57:16,244 --> 01:57:17,145
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, then, I believe it.

1775
01:57:17,385 --> 01:57:19,326
[SPEAKER_11]: What about the Prince of Persia trilogy 3D?

1776
01:57:19,346 --> 01:57:20,407
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the other one that's being rumored.

1777
01:57:20,427 --> 01:57:21,288
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't heard about that one yet.

1778
01:57:21,888 --> 01:57:23,569
[SPEAKER_06]: Only if it has video of Jake Gyllenhaal.

1779
01:57:23,789 --> 01:57:29,050
[SPEAKER_09]: But I can imagine that they would because everybody's kind of jumping on that bandwagon of re-releasing stuff.

1780
01:57:29,231 --> 01:57:30,191
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, I'm okay with that.

1781
01:57:30,251 --> 01:57:31,511
[SPEAKER_11]: Prince of Persia games are pretty awesome.

1782
01:57:31,551 --> 01:57:34,692
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the Sands of Time, Warrior Within, and the Two Thrones all coming out.

1783
01:57:34,792 --> 01:57:38,233
[SPEAKER_09]: Sounds like they'd be a perfect tie-in with the DVD release of the movie now, wouldn't it?

1784
01:57:38,293 --> 01:57:38,734
[SPEAKER_11]: Wouldn't it?

1785
01:57:39,194 --> 01:57:44,075
[SPEAKER_11]: And the Mortal Kombat HD collection might make the perfect companion piece to the new Mortal Kombat game, wouldn't it?

1786
01:57:45,056 --> 01:57:48,357
[SPEAKER_06]: How about Jake Gyllenhaal and the oncoming something?

1787
01:57:48,377 --> 01:57:48,677
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1788
01:57:48,837 --> 01:57:49,137
[SPEAKER_06]: Never mind.

1789
01:57:51,631 --> 01:57:54,897
[SPEAKER_06]: I try to make sex jokes around you, Robin, I just can't because I'm distracted by you.

1790
01:57:55,137 --> 01:57:58,403
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not sure how to take that, but I think it's a compliment.

1791
01:58:01,789 --> 01:58:23,440
[SPEAKER_11]: Derek H says they should remake every game with parallax backgrounds in 3D that might actually happen on the 3DS actually if what we saw at I almost said Classic Gaming Expo I didn't even fucking go to that what am I thinking at E3 as any indication because you know they had like the Xevious this old old old Namco game from like the 80s was redone in 3D parallel

1792
01:58:24,461 --> 01:58:27,724
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, they had Star Fox was redone.

1793
01:58:28,044 --> 01:58:30,486
[SPEAKER_11]: They were talking about redoing Ocarina of Time.

1794
01:58:30,846 --> 01:58:32,788
[SPEAKER_11]: They're going to go back and redo all these games in 3D.

1795
01:58:34,406 --> 01:58:34,846
[SPEAKER_15]: Why?

1796
01:58:35,547 --> 01:58:36,187
[SPEAKER_11]: You know why?

1797
01:58:36,627 --> 01:58:42,131
[SPEAKER_09]: It's because they can just take the code they already have, tack on 3D, and re-release the damn game again.

1798
01:58:42,191 --> 01:58:48,694
[SPEAKER_09]: Just like we can take some GameCube games, tack on Wii Remote Waggle, and re-release it.

1799
01:58:48,834 --> 01:58:49,275
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, look!

1800
01:58:49,495 --> 01:58:52,056
[SPEAKER_09]: We're supporting the fans because we released lots of games this year.

1801
01:58:52,957 --> 01:58:53,397
[SPEAKER_09]: New games?

1802
01:58:54,898 --> 01:58:55,478
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I'm sorry.

1803
01:58:55,518 --> 01:58:57,920
[SPEAKER_11]: That would actually be just games.

1804
01:58:57,960 --> 01:59:01,161
[SPEAKER_11]: You've got to admit, a game like Pilotwings would be kind of awesome in 3D.

1805
01:59:02,422 --> 01:59:05,123
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, I have to admit, okay, here's the thing though, Rice Francis, keep this in mind.

1806
01:59:05,464 --> 01:59:06,464
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't like 3D either.

1807
01:59:06,704 --> 01:59:12,607
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, I don't like hearing about all these movies and things that are in 3D, but the 3DS is, for some reason, is different.

1808
01:59:13,107 --> 01:59:19,430
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, A, you can turn off the 3D when it bugs you because it has a slider that lets you adjust the intensity so it's easier on your eyes.

1809
01:59:19,790 --> 01:59:42,590
[SPEAKER_11]: and it is kind of a neat effect I gotta say being able to see the 3D without glasses is kind of cool I don't know how long that'll last but here's something that kind of has me thinking you know for the longest time we've been wondering where are virtual console games on the DSi where are virtual console games and virtual consoles kind of slowed up lately what if a lot of these re-releases with 3D end up being downloadable games for the DSi

1810
01:59:42,930 --> 01:59:46,192
[SPEAKER_11]: They're going to re-release these games all over again, but this time they're in 3D.

1811
01:59:46,672 --> 01:59:51,034
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, if the price is right, like $5, $10, it could be worth it for some of these games.

1812
01:59:52,615 --> 01:59:54,336
[SPEAKER_11]: Only the real, real classics.

1813
01:59:54,516 --> 01:59:57,518
[SPEAKER_11]: I wouldn't buy games like Princess Tomato and Salad Kingdom or whatever.

1814
01:59:57,658 --> 01:59:58,779
[SPEAKER_15]: What are you talking about?

1815
01:59:58,799 --> 01:59:59,359
[SPEAKER_15]: That is a real classic.

1816
01:59:59,379 --> 02:00:00,420
[SPEAKER_11]: That's my favorite game ever.

1817
02:00:00,440 --> 02:00:00,940
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, shut up.

1818
02:00:02,341 --> 02:00:04,282
[SPEAKER_11]: You wouldn't want to play Clash and Demon Head in 3D?

1819
02:00:04,502 --> 02:00:07,203
[SPEAKER_15]: No, you're fixing something that's not broken.

1820
02:00:07,603 --> 02:00:09,284
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know, it's not worth it to me.

1821
02:00:09,324 --> 02:00:10,845
[SPEAKER_15]: Why would I pay for it again?

1822
02:00:11,585 --> 02:00:13,666
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, it was fine how it was before.

1823
02:00:13,826 --> 02:00:18,248
[SPEAKER_15]: And you know, if I want 3D, I'll just go into real life.

1824
02:00:19,248 --> 02:00:21,870
[SPEAKER_15]: I hear they have 3D in real life.

1825
02:00:21,950 --> 02:00:23,410
[SPEAKER_11]: Apparently, yes, they do.

1826
02:00:23,570 --> 02:00:25,171
[SPEAKER_15]: So, I mean, I don't know.

1827
02:00:25,811 --> 02:00:26,832
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just not down with the 3D.

1828
02:00:27,819 --> 02:00:28,279
[SPEAKER_11]: Outro Outro

1829
02:00:48,271 --> 02:00:50,313
[SPEAKER_15]: at the naked woman in the window.

1830
02:01:09,409 --> 02:01:32,733
[SPEAKER_11]: but some of it here's the thing but then some of the 3D effects what they do is they put the main image on the very very back plane so that way when there's 3D effects it does look like things are coming forward because they'll put the static image on the very last plane in the very back and then things are shooting out like there was one little demo they were showing out on the floor that was somebody opening a champagne bottle in slow motion and the champagne goes everywhere and

1831
02:01:32,953 --> 02:01:34,614
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it's just to show off the technology.

1832
02:01:34,854 --> 02:01:40,778
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, like, all I think of when I think of that is just Nintendo saying, we're Nintendo.

1833
02:01:41,258 --> 02:01:42,179
[SPEAKER_15]: Give me your money.

1834
02:01:42,699 --> 02:01:43,659
[SPEAKER_15]: Give me your money.

1835
02:01:43,739 --> 02:01:45,260
[SPEAKER_11]: And people give them their money.

1836
02:01:45,360 --> 02:01:45,881
[SPEAKER_11]: I know.

1837
02:01:46,381 --> 02:01:47,682
[SPEAKER_06]: They're still the number one console.

1838
02:01:47,722 --> 02:01:55,747
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm just worried that when this gimmick fades like it will, that the 3DS, I mean, which, you know, you'd hope that it would be around for a few years, but it's just going to die.

1839
02:01:55,967 --> 02:01:58,148
[SPEAKER_11]: Every seven-year-old is going to want one.

1840
02:01:58,488 --> 02:02:01,050
[SPEAKER_11]: every single 7 year old on the planet is going on well we'll see

1841
02:02:20,715 --> 02:02:25,116
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, a system is only as good as the games that are on it, and there are a lot of very promising developers hopping in on it.

1842
02:02:25,637 --> 02:02:36,900
[SPEAKER_11]: Although, again, it's portable gaming, and I'm not always the biggest fan of portable games, but if it can give me something that the television games can't, 3D in this case, might be worth a look.

1843
02:02:36,940 --> 02:02:37,280
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

1844
02:02:38,641 --> 02:02:41,802
[SPEAKER_11]: If it has really, really, really great games that necessitate it, I'm going to have to go.

1845
02:02:42,435 --> 02:02:44,317
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, you can go ahead and spend your money.

1846
02:02:44,457 --> 02:02:45,058
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm poor.

1847
02:02:46,480 --> 02:02:48,622
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just going to have to go buy a Virtual Boy.

1848
02:02:48,682 --> 02:02:50,184
[SPEAKER_11]: You can always steal one.

1849
02:02:50,845 --> 02:02:52,126
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh my God, that's a great idea.

1850
02:02:52,146 --> 02:02:53,648
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll be over at your house soon.

1851
02:02:53,748 --> 02:02:55,130
[SPEAKER_11]: We're both going to steal yours, Rob.

1852
02:02:55,690 --> 02:02:56,491
[SPEAKER_11]: No, bad idea.

1853
02:02:56,551 --> 02:02:56,912
[SPEAKER_11]: Never mind.

1854
02:02:56,952 --> 02:02:57,573
[SPEAKER_11]: Forget I said that.

1855
02:02:57,693 --> 02:02:58,774
[SPEAKER_15]: Ha ha, it's your fault.

1856
02:02:58,934 --> 02:03:00,475
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, let's go to the mailbag.

1857
02:03:00,796 --> 02:03:02,157
[SPEAKER_11]: Every week you guys send us emails.

1858
02:03:02,217 --> 02:03:10,964
[SPEAKER_11]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com DarkSakura's gonna open up the email bag, dive in head first, try not to drown under the massive emails that are in there.

1859
02:03:11,724 --> 02:03:14,526
[SPEAKER_11]: Try not to inhale any of the anthrax that comes with the messages.

1860
02:03:15,787 --> 02:03:16,688
[SPEAKER_11]: And read a few for you.

1861
02:03:19,230 --> 02:03:21,932
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, this one is from LabratY2K.

1862
02:03:22,533 --> 02:03:24,694
[SPEAKER_14]: I just finished a journey into my own gaming vault.

1863
02:03:24,734 --> 02:03:28,897
[SPEAKER_14]: This trip had me play Earthbound Mother in Japan for the SNES for the first time.

1864
02:03:29,378 --> 02:03:31,740
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like they read Rice Princess's mind.

1865
02:03:31,820 --> 02:03:32,540
[SPEAKER_14]: I know.

1866
02:03:32,700 --> 02:03:34,562
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't speak highly enough of this game.

1867
02:03:34,662 --> 02:03:37,824
[SPEAKER_14]: It had a great story and I found that I actually cared about the NPCs.

1868
02:03:38,365 --> 02:03:39,966
[SPEAKER_14]: Additionally, I truly enjoyed the humor.

1869
02:03:40,406 --> 02:03:43,929
[SPEAKER_14]: This is something that's been missing from most of the recent JRPGs.

1870
02:03:44,609 --> 02:04:07,272
[SPEAKER_11]: if you haven't covered this on your retro gaming segment it would definitely be worth consideration Labrat Y2K I concur well now if you don't play it all the way to the very very end where you actually beat it then be careful because Rise Princess will make fun of you for the rest of your life so you better play it to completion it's true don't just play the first town like Rob did I played at least four towns

1871
02:04:08,430 --> 02:04:09,812
[SPEAKER_15]: Are you sure about that?

1872
02:04:10,532 --> 02:04:11,974
[SPEAKER_11]: I had a full party of people.

1873
02:04:12,074 --> 02:04:14,997
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, you don't get that until, like, practically halfway through the game.

1874
02:04:16,799 --> 02:04:18,721
[SPEAKER_11]: Stop laughing at me, you bitch!

1875
02:04:20,223 --> 02:04:21,585
[SPEAKER_14]: Greetings again from Rababa.

1876
02:04:23,813 --> 02:04:51,105
[SPEAKER_14]: I have been hoping and waiting for Verizon to get an iPhone contract because I'm shopping for a phone keep on waiting let's imagine that if it became reality I have some pretty good reasons to believe that apps that use the network for gaming or social networking will not work between AT&T and Verizon the only ones that will are the ones that push and pull things via the internet like Facebook or Twitter app I think this will be an eye-opening disappointment I hope I'm wrong imagine iPhones with babies

1877
02:04:54,054 --> 02:04:56,625
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not sure I follow the logic there, why they wouldn't work.

1878
02:04:57,523 --> 02:04:58,884
[SPEAKER_14]: Next email.

1879
02:04:58,944 --> 02:04:59,044
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey.

1880
02:05:28,711 --> 02:05:33,533
[SPEAKER_14]: With the Plants vs. Zombies talk on the last show, it brings to focus my addiction to the game on Steam.

1881
02:05:33,953 --> 02:05:36,094
[SPEAKER_14]: Looking over my playtime is almost depressing.

1882
02:05:36,254 --> 02:05:37,254
[SPEAKER_14]: Portal, 2 hours.

1883
02:05:37,334 --> 02:05:41,516
[SPEAKER_14]: Half-Life 2, one of the best first-person shooters made, 44 minutes.

1884
02:05:41,876 --> 02:05:43,296
[SPEAKER_14]: Team Fortress 2, 2 hours.

1885
02:05:43,376 --> 02:05:44,437
[SPEAKER_14]: Torchlight, 8 hours.

1886
02:05:44,517 --> 02:05:46,798
[SPEAKER_14]: Plants vs. Zombies Game of the Year Edition, 40 hours.

1887
02:05:48,238 --> 02:05:48,558
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

1888
02:05:48,618 --> 02:05:52,139
[SPEAKER_14]: Hopefully, I'll have the chance to give the other games the playtime they deserve.

1889
02:05:52,199 --> 02:05:59,541
[SPEAKER_14]: In the meantime, I'm really hoping that next year's Plants vs. Zombies DS game will feature the multiplayer elements of the 360 release.

1890
02:05:59,901 --> 02:06:04,522
[SPEAKER_14]: Keep podcasting and stay something.

1891
02:06:04,882 --> 02:06:08,183
[SPEAKER_11]: Robert M. It's like the listeners are reading our minds this week.

1892
02:06:08,823 --> 02:06:14,004
[SPEAKER_11]: Plants vs. Zombies, everybody's talking about how they've been playing that, even though that game's a good year too old at this point.

1893
02:06:14,545 --> 02:06:16,125
[SPEAKER_14]: It's because you're psychic, Rob.

1894
02:06:16,806 --> 02:06:17,226
[SPEAKER_11]: Shut up.

1895
02:06:18,366 --> 02:06:19,106
[SPEAKER_14]: No, no, no.

1896
02:06:19,226 --> 02:06:19,466
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1897
02:06:19,606 --> 02:06:20,486
[SPEAKER_14]: Greetings, OLR.

1898
02:06:20,566 --> 02:06:23,187
[SPEAKER_14]: It's your friendly neighborhood turtle here.

1899
02:06:23,847 --> 02:06:26,228
[SPEAKER_14]: I just wanted to thank you so much for the marathon show.

1900
02:06:26,268 --> 02:06:29,849
[SPEAKER_14]: I actually listened to the entire podcast in one long day of work.

1901
02:06:30,409 --> 02:06:31,489
[SPEAKER_14]: I was worn out after that.

1902
02:06:31,689 --> 02:06:39,291
[SPEAKER_14]: Anywho, I think the idea of BlizzCon is stupid, but is anyone besides me pulling out their hair while waiting for any news about Diablo 3?

1903
02:06:40,151 --> 02:06:47,519
[SPEAKER_14]: Back in the day of Diablo 2, I never used any form of voiceover IP and still spent hundreds of hours playing it.

1904
02:06:47,939 --> 02:06:51,042
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't imagine the addiction this time around.

1905
02:06:51,423 --> 02:06:57,649
[SPEAKER_14]: Keep up the great work on the best structured, most informational, and best podcast running on the internet tubes.

1906
02:06:58,150 --> 02:07:01,433
[SPEAKER_14]: Your loyal turtle in Philly, Serious Turtle.

1907
02:07:02,674 --> 02:07:04,075
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1908
02:07:26,849 --> 02:07:28,370
[SPEAKER_11]: Diablo 3 Diablo 3 Diablo 3

1909
02:07:53,013 --> 02:07:54,374
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, it's because I'm not Korean.

1910
02:07:56,815 --> 02:07:57,575
[SPEAKER_14]: Can I read?

1911
02:07:58,076 --> 02:07:58,336
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

1912
02:07:59,036 --> 02:07:59,816
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm reading it anyway.

1913
02:08:00,737 --> 02:08:05,559
[SPEAKER_14]: Dear OLR, I was listening to Loki's feltastic apple metaphor and thought I'd take a crack at it.

1914
02:08:06,480 --> 02:08:09,361
[SPEAKER_14]: So I went to take me and a bunch of my friends out to a restaurant.

1915
02:08:09,501 --> 02:08:14,043
[SPEAKER_14]: I could just get takeout and have a party at home, but I like the experience that comes with dining out.

1916
02:08:14,423 --> 02:08:16,304
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, I don't want my house getting trashed.

1917
02:08:16,704 --> 02:08:21,827
[SPEAKER_14]: So I treat my friends to dinner at a semi-fine restaurant, paying for the entire meal because I'm a nerd with a full-time job.

1918
02:08:22,347 --> 02:08:29,109
[SPEAKER_14]: The restaurant presumably includes the cost of the dining experience, waiters, dishes, silverware, bad music, random crap on the walls, etc.

1919
02:08:30,069 --> 02:08:35,410
[SPEAKER_14]: End with the cost of the meal, because if people saw what this actually costs, they might not choose to enjoy the dining experience.

1920
02:08:36,030 --> 02:08:38,771
[SPEAKER_14]: This cost comes to me because I'm the one paying.

1921
02:08:39,171 --> 02:08:49,294
[SPEAKER_14]: However, if the restaurant is an establishment that makes each individual person pay for their own dining experience, and I'm not going to stand out in front of a restaurant and yell, FUCK YOU AND FUCK YOUR FUCKING DINING FEE!

1922
02:08:50,274 --> 02:08:54,236
[SPEAKER_14]: Instead, I will give my business to a different restaurant that doesn't charge outrageous dining fees.

1923
02:08:54,656 --> 02:08:57,337
[SPEAKER_14]: That, ladies and gentlemen, is how to craft a metaphor.

1924
02:08:57,917 --> 02:08:59,118
[SPEAKER_14]: Stay black, Red Entertainment.

1925
02:08:59,618 --> 02:09:03,239
[SPEAKER_14]: This message was brought to you by 2x plus 2y minus 8 equals 4y.

1926
02:09:03,559 --> 02:09:07,501
[SPEAKER_14]: Solve for x. The answer, by the way, is x equals y plus 4.

1927
02:09:07,881 --> 02:09:08,101
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry.

1928
02:09:08,541 --> 02:09:10,042
[SPEAKER_15]: None of us are black.

1929
02:09:11,198 --> 02:09:13,599
[SPEAKER_11]: You weren't here when that happened.

1930
02:09:14,560 --> 02:09:20,884
[SPEAKER_11]: We had a caller on the show and Dan was just like, at the end, there was that awkward silence and Dan was like, alright, stay black, have a good week.

1931
02:09:20,924 --> 02:09:22,164
[SPEAKER_11]: And we were just like, what?

1932
02:09:22,245 --> 02:09:23,565
[SPEAKER_14]: Now I will explain my answer.

1933
02:09:24,106 --> 02:09:26,127
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1934
02:09:26,247 --> 02:09:28,388
[SPEAKER_14]: 2x plus 2y minus x equals 4y.

1935
02:09:28,608 --> 02:09:30,229
[SPEAKER_14]: Subtract 2y from one side.

1936
02:09:30,269 --> 02:09:30,770
[SPEAKER_14]: Who cares?

1937
02:09:32,290 --> 02:09:33,191
[SPEAKER_15]: Obviously, Jamie.

1938
02:09:34,045 --> 02:09:34,405
[SPEAKER_11]: I know.

1939
02:09:34,606 --> 02:09:36,908
[SPEAKER_11]: She just wants to show off her algebra skills.

1940
02:09:37,008 --> 02:09:41,171
[SPEAKER_14]: No, it's because I have these numbers running through my brain all the time now, stupid algebra.

1941
02:09:42,112 --> 02:09:46,456
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, I want to go back to the metaphor because it didn't really make any sense to me at all, but I like the story.

1942
02:09:46,536 --> 02:09:47,277
[SPEAKER_11]: Cool story, bro.

1943
02:09:48,358 --> 02:09:48,878
[SPEAKER_14]: Stay black.

1944
02:09:51,400 --> 02:09:51,741
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1945
02:09:53,742 --> 02:09:54,083
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

1946
02:09:54,505 --> 02:09:56,286
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, is that it for the mailbag or do we have more emails?

1947
02:09:56,646 --> 02:09:57,487
[SPEAKER_14]: That's all I'm going to read.

1948
02:09:59,628 --> 02:10:02,009
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, if you didn't get your email read, how sad for you.

1949
02:10:02,169 --> 02:10:02,629
[SPEAKER_11]: Try again.

1950
02:10:02,689 --> 02:10:08,752
[SPEAKER_11]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com and you should put at the top, like, DarkSakura, read this or I'll send you more math.

1951
02:10:09,453 --> 02:10:10,753
[SPEAKER_11]: That's how you get her to read more emails.

1952
02:10:11,474 --> 02:10:12,134
[SPEAKER_11]: Threaten her with math.

1953
02:10:12,154 --> 02:10:12,874
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you say send me meth?

1954
02:10:13,314 --> 02:10:14,015
[SPEAKER_11]: No, math.

1955
02:10:14,255 --> 02:10:15,436
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I could use the meth.

1956
02:10:16,656 --> 02:10:16,956
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, my.

1957
02:10:17,136 --> 02:10:17,677
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm tired.

1958
02:10:17,697 --> 02:10:18,757
[SPEAKER_11]: She has to party all night.

1959
02:10:18,857 --> 02:10:19,177
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1960
02:10:20,138 --> 02:10:22,259
[SPEAKER_11]: Now's the part of the show where we get angsty.

1961
02:10:22,699 --> 02:10:24,120
[SPEAKER_11]: FU's of the Week.

1962
02:10:38,394 --> 02:11:02,500
[SPEAKER_09]: I would like to say an F you to Pollen and... I'd give an F you to people that are too slow to finish a transaction.

1963
02:11:04,580 --> 02:11:05,701
[SPEAKER_09]: You know who I'm talking about.

1964
02:11:06,981 --> 02:11:07,241
[SPEAKER_09]: Person.

1965
02:11:09,585 --> 02:11:10,905
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm trying to buy something for somebody.

1966
02:11:10,925 --> 02:11:14,907
[SPEAKER_09]: I paid them and now they're like, oh, I'm really busy right now.

1967
02:11:15,327 --> 02:11:15,847
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1968
02:11:16,427 --> 02:11:16,807
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all right.

1969
02:11:16,827 --> 02:11:20,229
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess I'll talk shit about them if they don't come through on their end.

1970
02:11:21,009 --> 02:11:23,410
[SPEAKER_15]: Good idea.

1971
02:11:23,670 --> 02:11:27,771
[SPEAKER_11]: F you to the fact that I'm having pains in my tooth like three days before I'm supposed to go to Disneyland.

1972
02:11:27,811 --> 02:11:31,832
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's like, I really don't want to go to the dentist right now because it's going to be so expensive.

1973
02:11:33,433 --> 02:11:35,794
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm going to be taking a big old box of oral gel with me.

1974
02:11:35,814 --> 02:11:36,594
[SPEAKER_11]: Good times.

1975
02:11:37,472 --> 02:11:39,675
[SPEAKER_15]: F you to licorice Black licorice specifically

1976
02:11:46,243 --> 02:11:47,804
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, F you to black licorice.

1977
02:11:49,285 --> 02:11:50,065
[SPEAKER_15]: Like I just said.

1978
02:11:50,326 --> 02:11:51,566
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you licorice racist?

1979
02:11:54,388 --> 02:11:55,849
[SPEAKER_14]: You just hate all licorice equally.

1980
02:11:56,049 --> 02:11:59,852
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't prefer to hang around black licorice, okay?

1981
02:11:59,892 --> 02:12:01,293
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't hate it.

1982
02:12:01,373 --> 02:12:03,634
[SPEAKER_15]: That's okay, because I hate all licorice equally.

1983
02:12:04,435 --> 02:12:05,155
[SPEAKER_15]: I like red licorice.

1984
02:12:05,495 --> 02:12:06,176
[SPEAKER_15]: Also, F you to 3D.

1985
02:12:08,397 --> 02:12:09,518
[SPEAKER_11]: and The Doctor, lastly.

1986
02:12:10,279 --> 02:12:12,000
[SPEAKER_06]: F you to money, because I want more of it.

1987
02:12:12,080 --> 02:12:13,301
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have any right now.

1988
02:12:14,022 --> 02:12:14,162
[SPEAKER_06]: Aww.

1989
02:12:15,083 --> 02:12:17,445
[SPEAKER_11]: But like, you live in the middle of nowhere where rent is like $20.

1990
02:12:17,845 --> 02:12:18,205
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

1991
02:12:18,285 --> 02:12:19,486
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't you even have a roommate now?

1992
02:12:19,726 --> 02:12:20,907
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I don't have a roommate anymore.

1993
02:12:21,007 --> 02:12:21,568
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I thought you did.

1994
02:12:21,588 --> 02:12:22,288
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that ship sailed.

1995
02:12:22,469 --> 02:12:22,749
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh-oh.

1996
02:12:22,869 --> 02:12:23,289
[SPEAKER_11]: What happened?

1997
02:12:23,329 --> 02:12:23,730
[SPEAKER_11]: Was it bad?

1998
02:12:24,530 --> 02:12:25,471
[SPEAKER_06]: It sailed.

1999
02:12:25,571 --> 02:12:26,172
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll talk later.

2000
02:12:26,892 --> 02:12:28,093
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh-oh.

2001
02:12:28,113 --> 02:12:28,954
[SPEAKER_06]: You're my roommate now.

2002
02:12:29,714 --> 02:12:30,435
[SPEAKER_06]: Woo-hoo!

2003
02:12:30,455 --> 02:12:31,136
[SPEAKER_06]: House party!

2004
02:12:31,196 --> 02:12:31,796
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay!

2005
02:12:31,836 --> 02:12:32,697
[SPEAKER_06]: In the middle of nowhere.

2006
02:12:33,838 --> 02:12:34,158
[SPEAKER_06]: Oops!

2007
02:12:34,218 --> 02:12:35,739
[SPEAKER_06]: Prank party!

2008
02:12:36,060 --> 02:12:36,280
[SPEAKER_06]: Oops!

2009
02:12:36,340 --> 02:12:37,621
[SPEAKER_06]: Prank party with Rob!

2010
02:12:38,911 --> 02:12:40,854
[SPEAKER_15]: Ship sailed, okay?

2011
02:12:40,915 --> 02:12:41,976
[SPEAKER_11]: Some comments from chat room.

2012
02:12:42,036 --> 02:12:44,381
[SPEAKER_11]: Ranma says, Hey, I'm black and I hate black licorice too.

2013
02:12:44,801 --> 02:12:46,785
[SPEAKER_11]: And Derek H is calling you a licoracist.

2014
02:12:50,663 --> 02:12:54,566
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, wow.

2015
02:12:56,307 --> 02:12:56,607
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

2016
02:12:58,068 --> 02:13:05,393
[SPEAKER_11]: Just a couple more news stories for you guys, and then the Skype line is going to be open at 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLaunchRadio.

2017
02:13:05,413 --> 02:13:07,154
[SPEAKER_11]: But not yet, because we have two more stories to go.

2018
02:13:07,675 --> 02:13:08,175
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki.

2019
02:13:08,215 --> 02:13:08,455
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

2020
02:13:09,035 --> 02:13:11,157
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want people to get their dialing fingers ready.

2021
02:13:11,417 --> 02:13:12,438
[SPEAKER_15]: They're dialing fingers.

2022
02:13:12,839 --> 02:13:15,321
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like playing Flamin' Finger at Dave & Buster's.

2023
02:13:15,341 --> 02:13:17,884
[SPEAKER_15]: Someone's sitting by their phone like, oh, I'm waiting for them to turn on.

2024
02:13:17,944 --> 02:13:18,484
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm waiting.

2025
02:13:18,925 --> 02:13:19,966
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm waiting.

2026
02:13:20,126 --> 02:13:28,835
[SPEAKER_09]: Microsoft, getting a taste of money because of Halo Reach, has decided, you know what, maybe one Halo game every three years.

2027
02:13:29,376 --> 02:13:30,417
[SPEAKER_09]: Not frequent enough.

2028
02:13:30,497 --> 02:13:31,558
[SPEAKER_09]: We need to be putting out

2029
02:13:32,170 --> 02:13:33,170
[SPEAKER_09]: More Halo games.

2030
02:13:33,250 --> 02:13:40,553
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're saying, you know, probably, I guess, Phil Spencer, this is Microsoft's VP.

2031
02:13:41,333 --> 02:13:47,115
[SPEAKER_09]: They're saying it's a matter of keeping players engaged and not going dark for two years at a time.

2032
02:13:48,015 --> 02:13:53,617
[SPEAKER_09]: They want to do what Activision has done with Call of Duty, which is whore that bitch out like no other.

2033
02:13:55,642 --> 02:14:02,548
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, and they said, I used to look at annual releases of non-sports games as people just like, uh, just trying to milk me.

2034
02:14:03,369 --> 02:14:09,254
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, I figured nobody had enough time to do a good job and all the negatives that would associate with those kinds of scenarios.

2035
02:14:09,655 --> 02:14:15,160
[SPEAKER_09]: Kudos to Activision because they've done a good job putting good game, um, continuing to release each year.

2036
02:14:15,640 --> 02:14:20,424
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the fans, um, like it and it's a good thing that they do it that way.

2037
02:14:21,745 --> 02:14:21,826
[SPEAKER_09]: Um,

2038
02:14:22,952 --> 02:14:25,693
[SPEAKER_09]: That's because they had two different developers working on it.

2039
02:14:27,214 --> 02:14:29,095
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if that's going to work with Halo.

2040
02:14:31,576 --> 02:14:35,998
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you think that Halo is just going to go really downhill now that a different studio is going to be developing it?

2041
02:14:36,398 --> 02:14:37,719
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yeah.

2042
02:14:37,739 --> 02:14:40,440
[SPEAKER_11]: Especially if it sounds like they're going to try to crank them out as fast as possible.

2043
02:14:40,520 --> 02:14:41,680
[SPEAKER_11]: That sounds dangerous.

2044
02:14:41,720 --> 02:14:46,703
[SPEAKER_09]: Just do not put Ruffian Games on Halo because they really fucked up Crackdown 2.

2045
02:14:46,743 --> 02:14:46,783
[SPEAKER_09]: Um...

2046
02:14:50,973 --> 02:14:53,975
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you think they're going to try and crank out a Halo game again as early as next year?

2047
02:14:55,456 --> 02:14:57,738
[SPEAKER_11]: Because if that's the case, then somebody's already working on it.

2048
02:14:59,042 --> 02:15:00,603
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, we'll have to see.

2049
02:15:01,744 --> 02:15:18,073
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just going to get to the point though, see with Call of Duty even, you know, Modern Warfare was really awesome and then Modern Warfare 2 was still very awesome and World at War that came out in between that was just kind of like, eh, it's alright, but still people went and played the one game.

2050
02:15:18,353 --> 02:15:22,496
[SPEAKER_09]: So people aren't necessarily buying every year's iteration of the game.

2051
02:15:23,476 --> 02:15:44,104
[SPEAKER_09]: and that's also another thing that's really hard to do when you're putting out a really good multiplayer game is like Halo Reach for example people will be playing Halo Reach until the next Halo game comes out but if it keeps coming out each year and if some of them happen to suck or maybe are made by Treyarch then people might not give a shit anymore

2052
02:15:47,637 --> 02:15:51,440
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope they don't take a respectable name and really drive it into the ground.

2053
02:15:51,480 --> 02:15:52,340
[SPEAKER_11]: But then again, you know what?

2054
02:15:52,360 --> 02:15:52,861
[SPEAKER_11]: Silent Hill.

2055
02:15:53,141 --> 02:15:55,522
[SPEAKER_11]: Fresh Blood isn't always a bad thing.

2056
02:15:55,802 --> 02:15:56,743
[SPEAKER_11]: It could be cool.

2057
02:15:57,103 --> 02:15:58,104
[SPEAKER_15]: Just most of the time.

2058
02:15:58,424 --> 02:16:01,866
[SPEAKER_09]: It could be cool, but the thing is, Microsoft, they need more franchises.

2059
02:16:04,147 --> 02:16:06,849
[SPEAKER_09]: Fable's a great game, I guess.

2060
02:16:07,269 --> 02:16:11,752
[SPEAKER_09]: I fucking hate Peeler and Molyneux so much.

2061
02:16:12,432 --> 02:16:12,732
[SPEAKER_09]: Why?

2062
02:16:13,113 --> 02:16:14,655
[SPEAKER_09]: He's such a prick.

2063
02:16:15,315 --> 02:16:15,996
[SPEAKER_09]: Seriously.

2064
02:16:16,356 --> 02:16:17,598
[SPEAKER_09]: Our game is so awesome.

2065
02:16:17,638 --> 02:16:19,400
[SPEAKER_09]: It does all these things that other games don't do.

2066
02:16:19,700 --> 02:16:21,202
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to really care for this dog.

2067
02:16:21,402 --> 02:16:24,566
[SPEAKER_09]: Really, I cared so much that I stopped playing months ago.

2068
02:16:25,827 --> 02:16:27,209
[SPEAKER_09]: This dog is going to become your life.

2069
02:16:27,849 --> 02:16:28,730
[SPEAKER_09]: No, he's annoying.

2070
02:16:29,251 --> 02:16:31,153
[SPEAKER_09]: He's like, hey, dig here, there's treasure here.

2071
02:16:31,213 --> 02:16:32,895
[SPEAKER_09]: Dig here, dig here, dig here, there's treasure here.

2072
02:16:34,315 --> 02:16:36,256
[SPEAKER_09]: You can raise your family and it's so wonderful.

2073
02:16:36,316 --> 02:16:40,857
[SPEAKER_09]: This time, you're going to be able to be the king or queen of your kingdom.

2074
02:16:40,897 --> 02:16:43,038
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to have to run it and things are going to happen.

2075
02:16:43,058 --> 02:16:45,678
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to have your dog still because everybody loves a dog.

2076
02:16:46,579 --> 02:16:48,659
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's really amazing.

2077
02:16:48,679 --> 02:16:53,301
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're going to do this Project Milo shit that's going to be so wonderful.

2078
02:16:53,441 --> 02:16:56,762
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to interact with this kid like you're interacting with a real kid.

2079
02:16:57,262 --> 02:16:58,122
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't play with your kids!

2080
02:16:58,542 --> 02:17:01,503
[SPEAKER_09]: Your kids can interact with this kid just like they're interacting with real friends.

2081
02:17:02,103 --> 02:17:31,049
[SPEAKER_09]: because they don't have real friends aww he's just so annoying with his like new technology and shit I'm sorry like here's the thing he comes out saying that these games are going to be so much more incredible than the last game because of all these reasons and they're like nearly identical to the last year's release it's like what happened to all this innovation that you're going to put in there because this game is kind of terrible

2082
02:17:32,163 --> 02:17:42,587
[SPEAKER_06]: and why don't we go back to the original Scrap Milo because yeah, that's stupid and creepy and we can do the we'll get an adult guy, an adult woman and then integrate porn into the games.

2083
02:17:42,967 --> 02:17:53,212
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm glad that they were able to show off this wonderful tech demo where they can interact with a child and stuff but like, if you actually heard about what the game was supposed to be about it was stupid.

2084
02:17:53,712 --> 02:18:00,995
[SPEAKER_09]: It was just like, oh you interact with this child and you help him find snails because he's moved here from Isn't that Connectimals?

2085
02:18:02,055 --> 02:18:03,636
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, no, this is a child.

2086
02:18:03,896 --> 02:18:05,637
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, it's not connected humans, okay?

2087
02:18:05,737 --> 02:18:07,097
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a child.

2088
02:18:07,477 --> 02:18:08,478
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a real boy.

2089
02:18:09,078 --> 02:18:12,159
[SPEAKER_09]: Like Pinocchio, he wants to be a real boy, but he's just digital.

2090
02:18:12,800 --> 02:18:22,644
[SPEAKER_09]: And you interact with him, you help him find snails, because he's just so depressed from flying here from, I think he was coming from Britain or something like that, somewhere in England.

2091
02:18:22,924 --> 02:18:23,725
[SPEAKER_09]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2092
02:18:47,666 --> 02:18:51,027
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not a British accent, it's a Peter Molyneux accent, that's how he talks.

2093
02:18:51,047 --> 02:18:54,047
[SPEAKER_11]: Dark Tetsuya says, well, I think Loki's British accent beats Rob's.

2094
02:18:54,848 --> 02:18:57,308
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not trying to sound British, I'm trying to sound like Peter Molyneux.

2095
02:18:57,328 --> 02:19:01,669
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello, I'm Mel B, and today we're going to be talking about Fable.

2096
02:19:02,069 --> 02:19:04,110
[SPEAKER_15]: Rob, that's bloody awful, bloody awful.

2097
02:19:04,170 --> 02:19:06,110
[SPEAKER_15]: What are you trying to do?

2098
02:19:06,690 --> 02:19:10,731
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, buy my new game, Mel B. Blah, blah, blah, girl power.

2099
02:19:10,971 --> 02:19:12,891
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's put another girl through her paces.

2100
02:19:12,971 --> 02:19:13,091
[SPEAKER_10]: Jeez.

2101
02:19:15,652 --> 02:19:20,296
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, you know, I remember when he was pimping out Halo, or not Halo, yeah, he was pimping out Halo.

2102
02:19:20,997 --> 02:19:21,578
[SPEAKER_09]: Milo in there.

2103
02:19:23,199 --> 02:19:28,924
[SPEAKER_09]: He was pimping out fucking Fable 2 and he's like, oh no, I'm going to show you something very innovative.

2104
02:19:29,545 --> 02:19:30,085
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a ball.

2105
02:19:31,146 --> 02:19:33,648
[SPEAKER_09]: You play fetch with the dog.

2106
02:19:34,489 --> 02:19:35,050
[SPEAKER_09]: With the ball.

2107
02:19:36,149 --> 02:19:38,330
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, I can fucking do that now.

2108
02:19:39,490 --> 02:19:40,230
[SPEAKER_09]: With my dog.

2109
02:19:40,530 --> 02:19:42,691
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't have a dog, I can throw a ball at my cat.

2110
02:19:43,351 --> 02:19:51,833
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's way more entertaining than playing... Who seriously is gonna go into Halo and play fetch with your fucking dog for hours on end?

2111
02:19:52,033 --> 02:19:55,394
[SPEAKER_09]: Is this what I'm really paying money for, is to play fetch with my fucking dog?

2112
02:19:56,494 --> 02:20:17,267
[SPEAKER_15]: granted it was fun killing people or like torturing them in this little like you know device you can sacrifice in the devil you can kill people in real life you act like it's impossible it's entirely possible we have salacious pop in chat says that this is Loki right now actually this is Loki right now

2113
02:20:23,827 --> 02:20:29,309
[SPEAKER_07]: I apologize that that was very low volume.

2114
02:20:29,349 --> 02:20:30,089
[SPEAKER_07]: Blame YouTube.

2115
02:20:30,629 --> 02:20:37,552
[SPEAKER_07]: I bet you anything, though, that Fable 3 is gonna be very, very, very, very, very similar to Fable 2.

2116
02:20:54,898 --> 02:20:57,720
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yay, DarkSakura's finally giving me back my Clue DVD.

2117
02:20:57,760 --> 02:20:59,541
[SPEAKER_11]: It's only been two years since she's had it.

2118
02:20:59,901 --> 02:21:01,262
[SPEAKER_11]: No, Rob, it's been longer.

2119
02:21:01,502 --> 02:21:02,943
[SPEAKER_11]: It feels like you have like three movies in here.

2120
02:21:02,963 --> 02:21:03,643
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I love Clue.

2121
02:21:03,983 --> 02:21:04,404
[SPEAKER_11]: Me too.

2122
02:21:04,444 --> 02:21:05,564
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to watch this when I get home.

2123
02:21:05,964 --> 02:21:06,345
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I'm not.

2124
02:21:06,365 --> 02:21:06,945
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to play WoW.

2125
02:21:07,505 --> 02:21:07,705
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

2126
02:21:08,766 --> 02:21:09,446
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, Rob.

2127
02:21:10,947 --> 02:21:11,768
[SPEAKER_15]: Don't joke with us.

2128
02:21:12,048 --> 02:21:14,149
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, can I do one more story, then we can open up the Skype line?

2129
02:21:14,249 --> 02:21:14,629
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure.

2130
02:21:14,789 --> 02:21:16,671
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, Nintendo will sue.

2131
02:21:17,351 --> 02:21:19,132
[SPEAKER_11]: At least that's what they've been doing this week.

2132
02:21:19,512 --> 02:21:20,092
[SPEAKER_11]: Threatening to do.

2133
02:21:20,693 --> 02:21:25,716
[SPEAKER_11]: They've been threatening Pokemon fan sites who have been posting Pokemon black and white screenshots.

2134
02:21:26,116 --> 02:21:31,779
[SPEAKER_11]: The game came out in Japan, and of course, folks have been importing it and have been posting screenshots of it on their fan sites.

2135
02:21:32,239 --> 02:21:36,942
[SPEAKER_11]: But Nintendo has brought down the legal hammer of justice with a cease and desist saying, quote,

2136
02:21:37,242 --> 02:21:56,772
[SPEAKER_11]: while Nintendo appreciates your interest in and support of the Pokemon game series your publication of this content infringes Nintendo's copyrights in violation of federal law your activity also has the potential to cause substantial damage to Nintendo and leaves Nintendo with no choice but to take steps to protect its intellectual property rights some of the sites that were hit PokerBeach PokerBeach?

2137
02:21:57,032 --> 02:22:05,636
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know PokerBeach.com all your Pokemon I don't know if that's one of the names of the Pokemon Suribee or something

2138
02:22:06,597 --> 02:22:27,334
[SPEAKER_11]: and of course they're very upset and this is awesome because Nintendo is so epically horrible at advertising their own stuff now yes they're going to get pissed off apparently when other people actually try to advertise for them like that's amazing it's also kind of disturbing to me that it's like well the game's out somewhere but hold on because there was an update that came out to this that might kind of shed a little light on it

2139
02:22:28,155 --> 02:22:45,268
[SPEAKER_11]: and it was some various commenters on websites were kind of noticing that the sites that got shut down were admitting to using ROMs to get the screens so maybe the problem wasn't that they were posting screenshots but it's admitting how they did it by getting ROMs of an import game

2140
02:22:46,369 --> 02:22:49,671
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, still, screenshots are just screenshots and the game is already out.

2141
02:22:49,791 --> 02:22:52,653
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, if you're going to go around openly saying, I stole the game.

2142
02:22:53,173 --> 02:22:58,536
[SPEAKER_09]: What if I said, you know, I wished upon a magic lamp and the genie granted me this copy of the game?

2143
02:22:59,176 --> 02:23:01,217
[SPEAKER_09]: Are they going to shut down my Pokemon site now?

2144
02:23:01,358 --> 02:23:02,978
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, then, maybe.

2145
02:23:03,339 --> 02:23:03,699
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

2146
02:23:04,042 --> 02:23:07,263
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I could say that it fell from the sky in a blaze of glory.

2147
02:23:07,403 --> 02:23:10,484
[SPEAKER_11]: Or you just don't say how you got the screenshots at all.

2148
02:23:10,544 --> 02:23:11,464
[SPEAKER_11]: You just post them.

2149
02:23:11,524 --> 02:23:13,024
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, isn't that what most websites do?

2150
02:23:13,264 --> 02:23:14,625
[SPEAKER_15]: But Rob, that would be logical and sensible.

2151
02:23:14,645 --> 02:23:16,245
[SPEAKER_11]: They get their exclusive report.

2152
02:23:16,285 --> 02:23:17,485
[SPEAKER_09]: We got an exclusive on Pokemon.

2153
02:23:17,505 --> 02:23:18,826
[SPEAKER_09]: But someone photoshopped those.

2154
02:23:18,846 --> 02:23:19,826
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are photoshopped.

2155
02:23:19,866 --> 02:23:21,967
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't believe that Pokemon has that in there.

2156
02:23:22,007 --> 02:23:27,128
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, also keep in mind that the DSi version was region locked.

2157
02:23:30,889 --> 02:23:31,390
[SPEAKER_14]: Black and White.

2158
02:23:31,410 --> 02:23:32,490
[SPEAKER_14]: I almost said Black and Blue.

2159
02:23:32,630 --> 02:23:33,771
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the Pokemon bruise.

2160
02:23:34,311 --> 02:23:35,372
[SPEAKER_11]: Y'all know Shane, right?

2161
02:23:35,452 --> 02:23:36,553
[SPEAKER_11]: He's been on the show a few times.

2162
02:23:36,693 --> 02:23:39,375
[SPEAKER_11]: He's playing Pokemon Black and White right now on his Japanese DS.

2163
02:23:39,995 --> 02:23:41,536
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

2164
02:23:42,016 --> 02:23:44,138
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the XL.

2165
02:23:45,058 --> 02:23:47,460
[SPEAKER_11]: He's playing it on an older one that isn't region locked.

2166
02:23:47,480 --> 02:23:50,161
[SPEAKER_11]: Because only the newer ones are region locked, so he has an old DS.

2167
02:23:50,181 --> 02:23:51,422
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's not a Japanese DS, but it's an old one.

2168
02:23:51,442 --> 02:23:52,403
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought he was playing it on his XL.

2169
02:23:52,663 --> 02:23:52,983
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

2170
02:23:53,023 --> 02:23:54,584
[SPEAKER_11]: He's playing it one way or another.

2171
02:23:55,425 --> 02:23:57,046
[SPEAKER_11]: That's all he ever posts about on Facebook anymore.

2172
02:23:57,626 --> 02:23:58,567
[SPEAKER_15]: Seriously.

2173
02:23:58,807 --> 02:23:59,807
[SPEAKER_11]: Just Pokemans.

2174
02:23:59,867 --> 02:24:01,028
[SPEAKER_11]: Let him tweet it to you.

2175
02:24:01,048 --> 02:24:04,230
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you're listening, call in so we can get a review on Pokemon Black and White.

2176
02:24:04,470 --> 02:24:06,791
[SPEAKER_11]: Although all he's going to say, he's going to say, it's awesome.

2177
02:24:07,351 --> 02:24:07,631
[SPEAKER_11]: Why?

2178
02:24:07,651 --> 02:24:08,912
[SPEAKER_11]: Because it's awesome.

2179
02:24:09,432 --> 02:24:09,612
[SPEAKER_11]: Why?

2180
02:24:09,632 --> 02:24:11,473
[SPEAKER_11]: Because it's Pokemon and they're awesome.

2181
02:24:11,573 --> 02:24:12,574
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, there's the review.

2182
02:24:12,634 --> 02:24:14,275
[SPEAKER_11]: That's going to be it right there.

2183
02:24:14,295 --> 02:24:15,475
[SPEAKER_14]: Now we don't need you to call in.

2184
02:24:15,535 --> 02:24:18,677
[SPEAKER_14]: Because Shane loves his Pokemans.

2185
02:24:19,057 --> 02:24:19,838
[SPEAKER_11]: I know, I know.

2186
02:24:20,118 --> 02:24:21,298
[SPEAKER_14]: Let him tweet them to you.

2187
02:24:21,518 --> 02:24:21,839
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

2188
02:24:23,297 --> 02:24:24,638
[SPEAKER_11]: Shall we open up the Skype line?

2189
02:24:24,898 --> 02:24:25,298
[SPEAKER_14]: Do it!

2190
02:24:25,558 --> 02:24:26,879
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's do it!

2191
02:24:27,319 --> 02:24:29,460
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's that commercial I was referring to earlier.

2192
02:24:29,560 --> 02:24:37,463
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen this commercial on real television.

2193
02:24:41,885 --> 02:24:43,766
[SPEAKER_11]: Pick up the phone and call us now.

2194
02:24:46,799 --> 02:24:50,460
[SPEAKER_11]: 1-877-GAME-OLR I should do this every week.

2195
02:24:50,721 --> 02:24:55,542
[SPEAKER_14]: I used to only see those when I would watch USA Up all night.

2196
02:24:55,802 --> 02:24:57,303
[SPEAKER_14]: I remember that.

2197
02:24:57,463 --> 02:24:58,843
[SPEAKER_11]: Pick up the phone.

2198
02:24:58,903 --> 02:24:59,603
[SPEAKER_11]: Call us right now.

[SPEAKER_11]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2200
02:25:03,805 --> 02:25:05,425
[SPEAKER_11]: Does the doctor want to do the calls tonight?

2201
02:25:06,065 --> 02:25:06,606
[SPEAKER_11]: You want to do the call?

2202
02:25:06,966 --> 02:25:07,306
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure.

2203
02:25:07,346 --> 02:25:08,286
[SPEAKER_11]: That's brilliant.

2204
02:25:08,386 --> 02:25:10,327
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, the doctor's going to do the calls tonight.

2205
02:25:11,167 --> 02:25:11,647
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, good.

2206
02:25:11,747 --> 02:25:12,808
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's what I'm going to do.

2207
02:25:12,968 --> 02:25:13,288
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

2208
02:25:13,348 --> 02:25:13,808
[SPEAKER_11]: We're waiting.

2209
02:25:13,828 --> 02:25:14,829
[SPEAKER_11]: We're just waiting for the calls to come in.

2210
02:25:14,869 --> 02:25:15,109
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

2211
02:25:15,329 --> 02:25:17,871
[SPEAKER_06]: Are there any calls?

2212
02:25:18,191 --> 02:25:18,911
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no one's calling.

2213
02:25:19,051 --> 02:25:19,511
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2214
02:25:19,791 --> 02:25:24,494
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a little delay between when we say things and when it goes out on all games and all that.

2215
02:25:24,514 --> 02:25:26,495
[SPEAKER_06]: So can I sit on your lap while I'm doing this?

2216
02:25:26,535 --> 02:25:27,195
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you really want to?

2217
02:25:27,335 --> 02:25:27,495
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

2218
02:25:27,876 --> 02:25:28,116
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

2219
02:25:28,136 --> 02:25:31,858
[SPEAKER_06]: I love how your legs spread open.

2220
02:25:31,878 --> 02:25:32,758
[SPEAKER_06]: You're like, you want to?

2221
02:25:34,559 --> 02:25:35,700
[SPEAKER_06]: You make it sound nasty.

2222
02:25:35,780 --> 02:25:36,220
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

2223
02:25:36,680 --> 02:25:38,381
[SPEAKER_06]: His legs are crossed and then he opened them wide.

2224
02:25:39,699 --> 02:25:39,959
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

2225
02:25:40,239 --> 02:25:41,340
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a wide stance.

2226
02:25:41,460 --> 02:25:46,702
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Rob's network's open and ready for business.

2227
02:25:47,362 --> 02:25:48,923
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, again, you're disgusting.

[SPEAKER_11]: Some nights we get hammerwood calls, some nights we don't get calls at all.

2230
02:25:56,186 --> 02:25:56,747
[SPEAKER_11]: It's my fault.

2231
02:25:56,987 --> 02:25:59,408
[SPEAKER_11]: I should have had the woman answering the phone.

2232
02:25:59,548 --> 02:26:00,909
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, Rice Princess, what do you think?

2233
02:26:01,349 --> 02:26:04,750
[SPEAKER_11]: Too busy in the kitchen baking things.

2234
02:26:05,691 --> 02:26:08,472
[SPEAKER_11]: By the way, Alan's listening right now and you just said, OMG, hot.

[SPEAKER_09]: Um, Pussycat Dolls with Busta Rhymes, Doncha mixed with, uh, Pitbull, I Know You Want Me.

02:27:28,253 --> 02:27:30,315
[SPEAKER_09]: That's from Prodigy as well.

2246
02:27:31,637 --> 02:27:33,279
[SPEAKER_09]: That's going to be done by the Scratch Perverts.

2247
02:27:35,518 --> 02:27:36,659
[SPEAKER_09]: and Lady Gaga.

2248
02:27:36,679 --> 02:27:41,961
[SPEAKER_09]: Bad Romance is going to have a beat juggle done by Tiesto, which would be pretty cool.

02:27:56,963 --> 02:27:58,264
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, that full list is out there.

2255
02:28:08,112 --> 02:28:08,492
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

2256
02:28:12,655 --> 02:28:13,516
[SPEAKER_11]: This is strange.

2257
02:28:13,556 --> 02:28:14,456
[SPEAKER_11]: Like nobody's calling.

2258
02:28:14,537 --> 02:28:16,258
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, of course, the minute I say that, there it goes.

2259
02:28:16,278 --> 02:28:16,718
[SPEAKER_11]: The lights up.

2260
02:28:16,838 --> 02:28:17,799
[SPEAKER_11]: Wait, did the doctor go away?

2261
02:28:17,819 --> 02:28:19,060
[SPEAKER_11]: He had to go, Connie.

2262
02:28:19,100 --> 02:28:19,380
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll enter.

2263
02:28:19,420 --> 02:28:19,801
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll enter.

2264
02:28:19,921 --> 02:28:21,182
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, DarkSakura, that's all you.

2265
02:28:22,763 --> 02:28:25,125
[SPEAKER_14]: Hello, you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2266
02:28:25,185 --> 02:28:26,025
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for calling.

2267
02:28:26,125 --> 02:28:26,666
[SPEAKER_14]: Who is this?

2268
02:28:29,275 --> 02:28:33,196
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, I'm calling you because I'm a very big fan of the show.

2269
02:28:33,216 --> 02:28:36,117
[SPEAKER_05]: We can hear you in the bathroom, dude.

2270
02:28:36,237 --> 02:28:37,417
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to speak with Rob.

2271
02:28:38,958 --> 02:28:39,778
[SPEAKER_11]: How can I help you?

2272
02:28:41,879 --> 02:28:46,500
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I don't know how you can help me, but maybe we can talk later about video games?

2273
02:28:47,180 --> 02:28:48,661
[SPEAKER_11]: Why don't we talk now about video games?

2274
02:28:48,681 --> 02:28:50,481
[SPEAKER_11]: You did call into a video game talk show after all.

2275
02:28:52,122 --> 02:28:54,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, well, I don't know.

2276
02:28:54,482 --> 02:28:55,123
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe later.

2277
02:28:55,563 --> 02:28:56,063
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye-bye.

2278
02:28:56,550 --> 02:29:01,513
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the worst 30 seconds of radio I've ever had in the... How long have we been doing this show, DarkSakura?

2279
02:29:01,533 --> 02:29:02,374
[SPEAKER_11]: About eight and a half years?

2280
02:29:02,934 --> 02:29:04,915
[SPEAKER_11]: That was the worst 30 seconds of the show.

2281
02:29:05,575 --> 02:29:09,118
[SPEAKER_11]: I think in the entire... That's saying something.

2282
02:29:09,238 --> 02:29:10,298
[SPEAKER_11]: What did I miss?

2283
02:29:10,839 --> 02:29:12,179
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I don't know.

2284
02:29:14,321 --> 02:29:17,443
[SPEAKER_11]: You missed somebody testing the phone to make sure it works, clearly.

2285
02:29:20,965 --> 02:29:22,806
[SPEAKER_15]: Nobody wants to talk to us.

2286
02:29:23,419 --> 02:29:30,968
[SPEAKER_11]: It's so funny how some weeks the phone will be ringing off the hook like we can't get enough of the calls in and then tonight it's just chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp, crickets.

2287
02:29:32,290 --> 02:29:34,291
[SPEAKER_11]: Did I say something to make you mad?

2288
02:29:35,611 --> 02:29:36,011
[SPEAKER_11]: Listeners?

2289
02:29:36,251 --> 02:29:37,131
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what we should do?

2290
02:29:37,211 --> 02:29:40,052
[SPEAKER_15]: We should speak in British accents until someone calls.

2291
02:29:40,092 --> 02:29:41,512
[SPEAKER_15]: And that'll force someone to call.

2292
02:29:41,712 --> 02:29:43,613
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, we'll have a jolly old time.

2293
02:29:43,633 --> 02:29:44,773
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, good lord.

2294
02:29:44,813 --> 02:29:45,993
[SPEAKER_10]: That's an amazing idea.

2295
02:29:46,013 --> 02:29:48,514
[SPEAKER_10]: Perhaps we could nibble on some tea and crumpets.

2296
02:29:48,694 --> 02:29:50,634
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'd love to nibble on your tea and crumpets.

2297
02:29:51,354 --> 02:29:52,595
[SPEAKER_14]: How do you nibble on tea?

2298
02:29:52,895 --> 02:29:53,455
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, Loki.

2299
02:29:55,077 --> 02:29:59,240
[SPEAKER_14]: They have made deep fried beer, so maybe they'll have deep fried tea.

2300
02:30:01,922 --> 02:30:02,663
[SPEAKER_11]: The phone's ringing.

2301
02:30:02,923 --> 02:30:03,763
[SPEAKER_11]: Doctor, are you answering?

2302
02:30:03,783 --> 02:30:04,304
[SPEAKER_11]: Who's answering?

2303
02:30:04,364 --> 02:30:05,084
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yeah, sure.

2304
02:30:05,124 --> 02:30:05,445
[SPEAKER_11]: Here we go.

2305
02:30:06,225 --> 02:30:08,006
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, welcome to Orange Lounge Radio.

2306
02:30:08,547 --> 02:30:09,067
[SPEAKER_06]: What's your name?

2307
02:30:09,888 --> 02:30:10,648
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Ranma.

2308
02:30:10,668 --> 02:30:11,208
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up, dude?

2309
02:30:11,489 --> 02:30:11,829
[SPEAKER_06]: Not much.

2310
02:30:11,849 --> 02:30:12,489
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you doing today?

2311
02:30:13,430 --> 02:30:13,970
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm alright.

2312
02:30:14,010 --> 02:30:17,433
[SPEAKER_04]: My back is killing me from an epic weekend, but other than that... Right on, right on.

2313
02:30:17,473 --> 02:30:18,253
[SPEAKER_06]: As long as it was epic.

2314
02:30:18,734 --> 02:30:19,574
[SPEAKER_06]: So what's on your mind?

2315
02:30:19,694 --> 02:30:21,476
[SPEAKER_04]: It was an awesome barbecue fest I went to.

2316
02:30:21,636 --> 02:30:22,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Sweet!

2317
02:30:23,103 --> 02:30:23,583
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely.

2318
02:30:23,823 --> 02:30:25,084
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you hurt your back from fucking?

2319
02:30:26,424 --> 02:30:26,724
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

2320
02:30:26,764 --> 02:30:29,005
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but you were complaining though, were you not?

2321
02:30:31,165 --> 02:30:32,425
[SPEAKER_06]: So what's on your mind, caller?

2322
02:30:33,166 --> 02:30:34,706
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, I want to bitch about Mad Catz.

2323
02:30:34,966 --> 02:30:36,346
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, go ahead.

2324
02:30:36,907 --> 02:30:39,107
[SPEAKER_04]: They need to stop making controllers, simple as that.

2325
02:30:39,447 --> 02:30:41,828
[SPEAKER_04]: Their stuff falls apart within like two, three months.

2326
02:30:41,868 --> 02:30:42,708
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that would suck.

2327
02:30:42,728 --> 02:30:48,310
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, because I bought a pair of cymbals for my rock band drum set.

2328
02:30:48,590 --> 02:30:49,950
[SPEAKER_04]: They stopped working within three months.

2329
02:30:51,059 --> 02:30:51,940
[SPEAKER_06]: Are they pretty cheap, though?

2330
02:30:51,980 --> 02:30:53,360
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, is it like you get what you pay for?

2331
02:30:55,381 --> 02:30:56,142
[SPEAKER_04]: Something like that.

2332
02:30:56,182 --> 02:31:01,304
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I got them replaced, and I use them sparingly, and they're starting to act up a little bit here and there.

2333
02:31:02,245 --> 02:31:08,248
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, they have updated them for the Rock Band 3 drum set since they're actually included with that now, and they're supposed to be more sensitive.

2334
02:31:08,588 --> 02:31:09,548
[SPEAKER_11]: When's Rock Band 3 out?

2335
02:31:09,588 --> 02:31:10,689
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to play it so bad.

2336
02:31:11,349 --> 02:31:12,250
[SPEAKER_09]: A few more weeks.

2337
02:31:13,490 --> 02:31:15,071
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like the 16th or something.

2338
02:31:15,091 --> 02:31:15,131
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh.

2339
02:31:17,659 --> 02:31:20,043
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, I'm getting a comment from Rice Princess here in the background.

2340
02:31:20,063 --> 02:31:20,804
[SPEAKER_06]: What's that, Rice Princess?

2341
02:31:21,485 --> 02:31:24,069
[SPEAKER_15]: I was just saying that Ranma was a piece of sexual chocolate.

2342
02:31:25,792 --> 02:31:27,915
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, my dear, and I love you too.

2343
02:31:30,138 --> 02:31:31,019
[SPEAKER_11]: Doctor and Rice Princess

2344
02:31:52,740 --> 02:31:53,721
[SPEAKER_15]: Yay, I want to do it.

2345
02:31:53,881 --> 02:31:57,023
[SPEAKER_11]: I tried to get my friend Victoria to do it, but she's kind of being flaky flake on it.

2346
02:31:57,123 --> 02:31:58,084
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I would definitely do that.

2347
02:31:58,244 --> 02:31:58,604
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you?

2348
02:31:58,644 --> 02:31:59,324
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, oh heck yeah.

2349
02:31:59,364 --> 02:32:00,265
[SPEAKER_11]: But we have to dress up.

2350
02:32:00,505 --> 02:32:00,765
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

2351
02:32:00,785 --> 02:32:01,346
[SPEAKER_06]: Like eccentric rock stars.

2352
02:32:01,366 --> 02:32:01,786
[SPEAKER_06]: Heck yeah.

2353
02:32:02,847 --> 02:32:03,407
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's do it.

2354
02:32:03,527 --> 02:32:04,508
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, we need a fourth.

2355
02:32:04,528 --> 02:32:04,848
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's do it.

2356
02:32:05,128 --> 02:32:06,289
[SPEAKER_11]: We need a fourth, DarkSakura.

2357
02:32:06,509 --> 02:32:08,651
[SPEAKER_15]: What would I do with my broken hand?

2358
02:32:09,051 --> 02:32:09,771
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, you can't do drums?

2359
02:32:10,112 --> 02:32:13,594
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh my God, it'll be like fucking Monocle all over again.

2360
02:32:13,734 --> 02:32:14,935
[SPEAKER_11]: You can do interpretive dance.

2361
02:32:15,856 --> 02:32:16,196
Okay.

2362
02:32:16,836 --> 02:32:19,019
[SPEAKER_14]: See, that is not... We can't use Beatles rock bands.

2363
02:32:19,079 --> 02:32:20,060
[SPEAKER_14]: Then we could have harmony.

2364
02:32:20,380 --> 02:32:24,024
[SPEAKER_11]: You have to rock star sing.

2365
02:32:26,366 --> 02:32:26,826
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly.

2366
02:32:26,846 --> 02:32:27,547
[SPEAKER_11]: There you go.

2367
02:32:27,727 --> 02:32:29,209
[SPEAKER_14]: Someone stepped on your toe.

2368
02:32:30,670 --> 02:32:32,432
[SPEAKER_14]: Or they shot her toe.

2369
02:32:32,973 --> 02:32:34,314
[SPEAKER_14]: I was just grimacing musically.

2370
02:32:35,146 --> 02:32:36,147
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, good stuff.

2371
02:32:36,568 --> 02:32:37,730
[SPEAKER_11]: I think this is going to have to happen.

2372
02:32:37,790 --> 02:32:39,472
[SPEAKER_11]: I agree.

2373
02:32:39,492 --> 02:32:40,393
[SPEAKER_11]: What do you think, Ranma?

2374
02:32:40,694 --> 02:32:43,337
[SPEAKER_11]: You have to get on stage and sing in front of hundreds of people.

2375
02:32:43,377 --> 02:32:43,678
[SPEAKER_06]: What's that?

2376
02:32:44,959 --> 02:32:45,800
[SPEAKER_14]: I said I'm all for it.

2377
02:32:46,021 --> 02:32:46,621
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome, awesome.

2378
02:32:46,922 --> 02:32:48,764
[SPEAKER_14]: I have to get over my stage fright now.

2379
02:32:49,305 --> 02:32:49,966
You'll be fine.

2380
02:32:50,747 --> 02:32:54,130
[SPEAKER_11]: Just put a paper bag on your head and cut out little seats.

2381
02:32:54,190 --> 02:32:56,852
[SPEAKER_14]: Like in Guitar Hero.

2382
02:32:57,253 --> 02:32:57,813
[SPEAKER_11]: Guitar Freaks.

2383
02:32:57,833 --> 02:32:59,495
[SPEAKER_11]: You can put a bucket of chicken thing on your head.

2384
02:32:59,955 --> 02:33:03,899
[SPEAKER_11]: No, because then I'd have to play guitar like Buckethead.

2385
02:33:03,959 --> 02:33:04,399
[SPEAKER_14]: There you go.

2386
02:33:04,459 --> 02:33:09,724
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I'm talking, you know, like the little icon guys from... Guitar Freaks.

2387
02:33:09,744 --> 02:33:12,847
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, that game that was made by Konami.

2388
02:33:12,867 --> 02:33:13,988
[SPEAKER_11]: That could be our band name.

2389
02:33:14,028 --> 02:33:15,229
[SPEAKER_11]: Guitar Freaks was first.

2390
02:33:17,671 --> 02:33:20,135
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if you want, I give you permission to use my band name.

2391
02:33:20,255 --> 02:33:20,655
[SPEAKER_11]: What's that?

2392
02:33:21,597 --> 02:33:22,318
[SPEAKER_04]: Rhythm and Juice.

2393
02:33:27,290 --> 02:33:28,852
[SPEAKER_11]: Rama, Jews have no rhythm.

2394
02:33:29,072 --> 02:33:29,533
[SPEAKER_11]: Come on.

2395
02:33:29,553 --> 02:33:33,737
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, shush.

2396
02:33:33,958 --> 02:33:34,618
[SPEAKER_10]: Hugs and kicks.

2397
02:33:34,638 --> 02:33:35,079
[SPEAKER_14]: Come on.

2398
02:33:35,880 --> 02:33:36,741
[SPEAKER_11]: I tease because I love.

2399
02:33:36,781 --> 02:33:41,926
[SPEAKER_14]: Tiara suggested that I could play with one arm like the drummer for Def Leppard.

2400
02:33:42,027 --> 02:33:47,493
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, that's an amazing idea because what you should do, you should do that whole thing where you put your hand through your shirt so it looks like you don't have an arm.

2401
02:33:48,940 --> 02:33:49,700
[SPEAKER_14]: and DarkSakura.com

2402
02:34:08,084 --> 02:34:09,105
[SPEAKER_14]: I would rather sing.

2403
02:34:10,366 --> 02:34:12,388
[SPEAKER_14]: It was a good idea at the time.

2404
02:34:12,989 --> 02:34:13,489
[SPEAKER_11]: I know, right?

2405
02:34:14,050 --> 02:34:16,292
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll just get DarkSakura good and drunk before she goes on stage.

2406
02:34:16,612 --> 02:34:18,874
[SPEAKER_14]: If you get me drunk, I won't be able to sing.

2407
02:34:19,095 --> 02:34:19,675
[SPEAKER_04]: Why get her drunk?

2408
02:34:19,695 --> 02:34:20,896
[SPEAKER_04]: Just bribe her with Guinness.

2409
02:34:20,956 --> 02:34:21,477
[SPEAKER_11]: That'll work.

2410
02:34:21,617 --> 02:34:22,638
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's the best part, guys.

2411
02:34:22,658 --> 02:34:23,559
[SPEAKER_14]: Guinness doesn't get me drunk.

2412
02:34:23,579 --> 02:34:27,282
[SPEAKER_11]: They stream Umlaut on the internet so all of you could watch.

2413
02:34:29,024 --> 02:34:29,745
[SPEAKER_04]: Never mind.

2414
02:34:30,786 --> 02:34:32,007
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll get the recorder ready.

2415
02:34:32,207 --> 02:34:32,688
[SPEAKER_11]: I know.

2416
02:34:32,708 --> 02:34:32,988
[SPEAKER_11]: Be good.

2417
02:34:34,432 --> 02:34:37,194
[SPEAKER_11]: Actdeft suggests instrument freaks or band freaks.

2418
02:34:39,255 --> 02:34:40,656
[SPEAKER_14]: Sax maniacs!

2419
02:34:40,696 --> 02:34:46,780
[SPEAKER_11]: Which is great because there's people from Harmonix that actually go to the event and it would be extremely offensive if we named it.

2420
02:34:46,820 --> 02:34:50,563
[SPEAKER_11]: Although I don't want to offend the people at Harmonix because they're wonderful people, but it would be funny.

2421
02:34:51,823 --> 02:34:53,164
[SPEAKER_14]: Could be freaky guitarists.

2422
02:34:53,244 --> 02:34:54,025
[SPEAKER_11]: We could be the 573s.

2423
02:34:54,145 --> 02:34:54,205
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

2424
02:34:54,305 --> 02:35:00,009
[SPEAKER_11]: Rob, why aren't you thinking of this?

2425
02:35:00,029 --> 02:35:01,209
[SPEAKER_11]: We could be the Spice Girls.

2426
02:35:01,229 --> 02:35:01,850
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

2427
02:35:02,748 --> 02:35:03,929
[SPEAKER_11]: We could dress up as Spice Girls.

2428
02:35:04,129 --> 02:35:05,750
[SPEAKER_14]: More like the Shice Girls.

2429
02:35:06,270 --> 02:35:07,671
[SPEAKER_11]: I get to be Jerry, that's all.

2430
02:35:07,752 --> 02:35:09,573
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, forget it.

2431
02:35:09,593 --> 02:35:10,493
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, Ranma.

2432
02:35:10,714 --> 02:35:12,014
[SPEAKER_11]: Anything else you want to share with our listeners?

2433
02:35:12,915 --> 02:35:15,037
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I just got one thing to say.

2434
02:35:15,237 --> 02:35:15,877
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll make it quick.

2435
02:35:16,157 --> 02:35:20,180
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm tired of everybody bitching at me that I jump on the Skype lane first for everybody else.

2436
02:35:20,420 --> 02:35:25,764
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't want me on almost every single week, call in and be relevant about something.

2437
02:35:25,784 --> 02:35:28,546
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't get mad at me because I have something to contribute to the show.

2438
02:35:28,686 --> 02:35:30,949
[SPEAKER_11]: They had a good 10 minutes to call before you got in.

2439
02:35:31,029 --> 02:35:31,409
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

2440
02:35:31,449 --> 02:35:32,190
[SPEAKER_04]: I was waiting.

2441
02:35:32,511 --> 02:35:36,355
[SPEAKER_04]: I was not waiting to be first, but no one was calling, so I stepped up.

2442
02:35:36,415 --> 02:35:37,296
[SPEAKER_11]: Calm down.

2443
02:35:37,737 --> 02:35:38,318
[SPEAKER_11]: Slow your roll.

2444
02:35:38,618 --> 02:35:39,859
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just tired of the play.

2445
02:35:39,899 --> 02:35:40,720
[SPEAKER_06]: No, you can get madder.

2446
02:35:40,740 --> 02:35:41,261
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of hot.

2447
02:35:41,401 --> 02:35:41,922
[SPEAKER_11]: That's good stuff.

2448
02:35:44,254 --> 02:35:46,515
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, Ranma, we're going to let you go so we can get more calls.

2449
02:35:46,875 --> 02:35:47,596
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, later.

2450
02:35:47,776 --> 02:35:48,297
[SPEAKER_11]: Take care, buddy.

2451
02:35:49,317 --> 02:35:49,397
[SPEAKER_11]: Bye.

2452
02:35:49,417 --> 02:35:49,878
[SPEAKER_11]: See you later.

2453
02:35:50,038 --> 02:35:55,642
[SPEAKER_11]: Somehow his phone call turned into convincing DarkSakura to sing in front of hundreds of people on the internet at Umlaut.

2454
02:35:55,982 --> 02:35:56,683
[SPEAKER_11]: I love this show.

2455
02:35:56,723 --> 02:35:57,163
[SPEAKER_11]: I really do.

2456
02:35:57,183 --> 02:35:57,563
[SPEAKER_06]: Good times.

2457
02:35:57,583 --> 02:35:58,764
[SPEAKER_11]: What are you going to play, Eddie?

2458
02:36:00,245 --> 02:36:00,585
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

2459
02:36:00,626 --> 02:36:00,966
[SPEAKER_06]: The harp.

2460
02:36:01,386 --> 02:36:02,927
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't have a harp.

2461
02:36:03,187 --> 02:36:03,948
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, damn it.

02:36:03,988 --> 02:36:05,069
[SPEAKER_11]: Whatever they've got, I'll do it.

2469
02:37:01,251 --> 02:37:16,097
[SPEAKER_11]: you know what's funny is now I'm seeing because Skype is popping up like all these people who have never called the show before are starting to call in so we're gonna have to make this call quick so we get to some more people but I just want to quickly throw this out here do you know how we used to learn Spanish in high school you'd probably get a kick out of this

2470
02:37:17,850 --> 02:37:18,771
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I haven't.

2471
02:37:19,011 --> 02:37:23,894
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, there's this little song and I still remember it to this day and it's how you learn how to conjugate verbs.

2472
02:37:23,914 --> 02:37:25,135
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, you ready?

2474
02:37:37,724 --> 02:37:39,145
[SPEAKER_11]: I still remember this song to this day.

2475
02:37:39,205 --> 02:37:39,906
[SPEAKER_11]: Isn't that pathetic?

2476
02:37:40,226 --> 02:37:40,946
[SPEAKER_15]: I took French.

2477
02:37:40,966 --> 02:37:42,848
[SPEAKER_15]: That's horrible, Rob.

2478
02:37:42,888 --> 02:37:44,629
[SPEAKER_15]: We didn't have any songs.

2479
02:37:44,689 --> 02:37:46,330
[SPEAKER_11]: What did you think of the verb conjugation song?

2480
02:37:46,350 --> 02:37:46,950
[SPEAKER_11]: Wasn't it awesome?

2481
02:37:47,992 --> 02:37:49,335
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, yeah.

2482
02:37:49,716 --> 02:37:49,996
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

2483
02:37:50,959 --> 02:37:53,565
[SPEAKER_11]: So speaking of video games, what's up in video game world?

2484
02:37:54,868 --> 02:37:56,291
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, video games, so interesting.

2485
02:37:56,813 --> 02:37:57,775
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I wanted to talk about...

2486
02:37:59,197 --> 02:38:26,021
[SPEAKER_11]: a story you talked about last week about a certain video game site that sells old games ah yes, that site that went up and down and then up again oh I think they're still down though because we're definitely not covering the story that they came back so in my mind I'm aware that they're still down there went my final story of the night aww, what would you want to say about the site that shall not be named?

2487
02:38:27,369 --> 02:38:42,376
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, not necessarily about this site, but about like Steam and other sites like, I don't remember the other, like Direct2Drive also, that sell games via digital distribution.

2488
02:38:46,522 --> 02:38:51,824
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you know, it has a lot of people kind of thinking about digital distribution with the website going down.

2489
02:38:51,884 --> 02:38:56,946
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of like a lot of people were giving it second thought, like, gee, is one day all my games just going to suddenly stop working?

2490
02:38:57,327 --> 02:39:06,830
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, to be fair, I believe the games that the website gogged me with a pitchfork was selling, they were DRM-free, right?

2491
02:39:07,591 --> 02:39:10,352
[SPEAKER_11]: And then Steam has always said if they ever go down –

2492
02:39:10,672 --> 02:39:11,293
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2493
02:39:29,229 --> 02:39:36,819
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it's kind of worrying because I have a lot of games I have bought and given to me on Steam.

2494
02:39:36,879 --> 02:39:43,347
[SPEAKER_13]: So I kind of worry about that where Steam is going to be down someday.

2495
02:39:43,367 --> 02:39:43,848
[SPEAKER_11]: It's possible.

2496
02:39:43,848 --> 02:40:04,669
[SPEAKER_11]: I think you'll be okay if you read the terms of service for Steam it sounds like you'll be okay now here's the one you would worry about honestly if I were you it would be that on live as neat as that service is and as cool as it looks with the whole streaming game through the internet or whatever when you buy those games you're basically buying the game on someone else's computer and if that service ever goes down you're going to lose that game now I think they've

2497
02:40:05,960 --> 02:40:30,346
[SPEAKER_11]: excuse me they've guaranteed it for what like three years I think but that's you know after that three years you may not have the game anymore which you know after three years you may not want to play the game anymore but I don't know there's some games I want to go back and visit after a long time like the very first Civilization I could still play that game it's great and no I didn't play Civ 5 this week I'm a bad Civ fan anyhow

2498
02:40:32,137 --> 02:40:33,498
[SPEAKER_13]: Good thing I'm live.

2499
02:40:34,239 --> 02:40:37,861
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's not available in Mexico, so I don't have to worry about that.

2500
02:40:38,181 --> 02:40:39,322
[SPEAKER_11]: Hopefully someday.

2501
02:40:39,622 --> 02:40:41,644
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys always get last in line.

2502
02:40:41,684 --> 02:40:42,264
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry.

[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

2505
02:40:44,266 --> 02:40:46,387
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, any other thoughts before we let you go?

2506
02:40:48,168 --> 02:40:49,229
[SPEAKER_13]: No, that's pretty much it.

2507
02:40:49,529 --> 02:40:49,789
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

2508
02:40:49,829 --> 02:40:54,673
[SPEAKER_11]: You have a good one, and I hope you enjoy the new Kirby game when it comes out because I know you're a big Kirby fan.

2509
02:40:54,913 --> 02:40:55,153
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

2510
02:40:55,213 --> 02:40:57,155
[SPEAKER_11]: It's in your icon in case I forgot.

[SPEAKER_11]: I kind of took over that call.

2515
02:41:05,404 --> 02:41:05,884
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all right.

2516
02:41:05,904 --> 02:41:06,224
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all right.

2517
02:41:06,404 --> 02:41:06,644
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead.

02:41:06,724 --> 02:41:07,125
[SPEAKER_06]: That's hot.

2519
02:41:07,425 --> 02:41:07,725
[SPEAKER_06]: That's hot.

2520
02:41:07,785 --> 02:41:10,406
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to be really horny tonight.

2521
02:41:10,806 --> 02:41:12,147
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

2522
02:41:12,207 --> 02:41:15,909
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, this concludes another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

2523
02:41:16,329 --> 02:41:16,549
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

2524
02:41:16,949 --> 02:41:17,410
[SPEAKER_11]: No, just kidding.

2525
02:41:17,470 --> 02:41:19,691
[SPEAKER_11]: We still have time for a few more calls.

2526
02:41:19,711 --> 02:41:23,773
[SPEAKER_11]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2527
02:41:23,813 --> 02:41:26,014
[SPEAKER_11]: And to those of you guys, I saw some first-time callers trying to get through.

2528
02:41:26,594 --> 02:41:28,435
[SPEAKER_11]: So we'll see if we can't get some of these calls here.

2529
02:41:30,243 --> 02:41:34,546
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that a call?

2530
02:41:34,586 --> 02:41:36,027
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, that is a call coming in right now.

2531
02:41:36,047 --> 02:41:36,447
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's take it.

2532
02:41:37,688 --> 02:41:39,309
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for calling Orange Lounge Radio.

2533
02:41:39,329 --> 02:41:40,249
[SPEAKER_06]: You're online with the doctor.

2534
02:41:40,289 --> 02:41:40,609
[SPEAKER_06]: What's up?

2535
02:41:42,791 --> 02:41:44,072
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, this is Red Entertainment.

2536
02:41:44,712 --> 02:41:45,152
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, what's up?

2537
02:41:45,352 --> 02:41:45,873
[SPEAKER_06]: What's on your mind?

2538
02:41:47,133 --> 02:41:49,015
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to bitch about PSN for a second.

2539
02:41:49,255 --> 02:41:50,015
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, right on.

2540
02:41:51,456 --> 02:41:57,360
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I got Move and I downloaded a couple demos because I didn't get the $99 PSN

2541
02:41:59,039 --> 02:42:01,761
[SPEAKER_03]: package with the demo disc in it.

2542
02:42:03,202 --> 02:42:13,570
[SPEAKER_03]: So I set this up to download overnight and usually I can go to work or set stuff to download overnight on live and it'll be done when I wake up or get home.

2543
02:42:15,352 --> 02:42:20,256
[SPEAKER_03]: So I wake up and the thing is my PlayStation 3 is still on.

2544
02:42:22,357 --> 02:42:22,978
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm serious.

2545
02:42:23,758 --> 02:42:25,120
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still trying to download?

2546
02:42:26,240 --> 02:42:28,262
[SPEAKER_03]: Well no, it downloaded overnight but it took

2547
02:42:28,729 --> 02:42:34,395
[SPEAKER_03]: at least eight hours because I went to sleep about 2 a.m.

2548
02:42:34,495 --> 02:42:37,337
[SPEAKER_03]: and left to go see a movie at about 11 and it was still on.

2549
02:42:38,419 --> 02:42:39,760
[SPEAKER_03]: What was it you were trying to download?

2550
02:42:39,800 --> 02:42:41,021
[SPEAKER_03]: Just the patch?

2551
02:42:42,202 --> 02:42:45,005
[SPEAKER_03]: Seven demos for Move.

2552
02:42:45,465 --> 02:42:45,826
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow.

2553
02:42:45,886 --> 02:42:47,828
[SPEAKER_03]: And none of them were any bigger than about 350 megs.

2554
02:42:51,092 --> 02:42:52,833
[SPEAKER_11]: It wasn't the same day the network went down, right?

2555
02:42:53,554 --> 02:42:55,055
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe they were just getting hammered?

2556
02:42:55,115 --> 02:42:55,515
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

2557
02:42:55,536 --> 02:42:57,217
[SPEAKER_11]: That's kind of freaky.

2558
02:42:57,717 --> 02:43:00,620
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, you can buy full games on PSN, can't you?

2559
02:43:00,660 --> 02:43:03,983
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like gigs and gigs of data that would just take you hours.

2560
02:43:04,003 --> 02:43:10,708
[SPEAKER_11]: You could just go out the door, drive to the mall downtown and back in less time than it would take for the stupid game to download.

2561
02:43:11,849 --> 02:43:15,352
[SPEAKER_11]: Digital distribution might not really be the wave of the future just yet.

2562
02:43:15,852 --> 02:43:21,457
[SPEAKER_11]: It works for the smaller games like on Xbox Live Arcade and some of the smaller PSN games but that's crazy.

2563
02:43:21,537 --> 02:43:27,843
[SPEAKER_11]: I imagine just a bunch of people were hitting it all at once but it's kind of surprising they don't have a better backup system for that.

2564
02:43:28,703 --> 02:43:40,193
[SPEAKER_03]: Well a lot of people must be trying to download the Heavy Rain move patch now because I triggered it to download at about 9 o'clock which is 8 Pacific and

2565
02:43:41,038 --> 02:43:41,438
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's it.

2566
02:44:03,251 --> 02:44:05,273
[SPEAKER_11]: This is pretty good quality for an iPad, I must say.

2567
02:44:05,293 --> 02:44:06,373
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't even know.

2568
02:44:06,413 --> 02:44:06,674
[SPEAKER_11]: Who knew?

2569
02:44:07,654 --> 02:44:07,935
[SPEAKER_11]: Huh.

2570
02:44:08,435 --> 02:44:10,196
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I don't know, sir.

2571
02:44:10,577 --> 02:44:14,400
[SPEAKER_11]: You could call Sony and complain, or you could just bitch about it on internet forums like you're doing now.

2572
02:44:14,480 --> 02:44:15,601
[SPEAKER_11]: Yay!

2573
02:44:15,621 --> 02:44:18,042
[SPEAKER_11]: Because that's probably what most people are going to be doing.

2574
02:44:18,383 --> 02:44:19,183
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, what can you do?

2575
02:44:19,203 --> 02:44:20,204
[SPEAKER_11]: Most of what the internet is for.

2576
02:44:20,464 --> 02:44:21,265
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, exactly.

2577
02:44:21,325 --> 02:44:24,127
[SPEAKER_11]: It's for bitching anonymously on internet forums about your products.

2578
02:44:24,487 --> 02:44:25,548
[SPEAKER_10]: Yay!

2579
02:44:26,349 --> 02:44:27,990
[SPEAKER_10]: Anything else you want to complain about while you're on?

2580
02:44:29,471 --> 02:44:29,771
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

2581
02:44:29,992 --> 02:44:30,292
[SPEAKER_03]: I was...

2582
02:44:31,791 --> 02:44:34,373
[SPEAKER_03]: I did finally play some of the demos and they're really good.

2583
02:44:34,433 --> 02:44:36,654
[SPEAKER_03]: The Tumble demo is really nice.

2584
02:44:37,675 --> 02:44:44,720
[SPEAKER_03]: And so is Ruse, which is kind of what I've always wanted from out of the Wii.

2585
02:44:45,560 --> 02:44:50,964
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you think that the PlayStation might have a serious competitor here to the Wii?

2586
02:44:54,046 --> 02:44:54,646
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

2587
02:44:54,686 --> 02:44:55,967
[SPEAKER_11]: It all depends on the games.

2588
02:44:56,407 --> 02:44:56,988
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, right.

2589
02:44:58,149 --> 02:45:00,050
[SPEAKER_11]: But it sounds like you were enjoying a couple of these demos?

2590
02:45:01,718 --> 02:45:24,189
[SPEAKER_11]: yeah the uh ruse demo is kind of this militaristic uh strategy game which I might have to pick that up when it finally comes out I don't know I still haven't got the move myself yet maybe uh maybe at some point or I'll just go over to Loki and play his that sounds like an even better idea right Loki yeah all right I haven't even played mine yet uh any other uh last thoughts before we let you go

2591
02:45:25,695 --> 02:45:26,295
[SPEAKER_11]: That's about it.

2592
02:45:26,535 --> 02:45:26,836
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

2593
02:45:26,896 --> 02:45:28,016
[SPEAKER_11]: Just don't forget to turn off the porn.

2594
02:45:28,036 --> 02:45:30,917
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully someday I will be able to play Heavy Rain with Move.

2595
02:45:31,318 --> 02:45:31,518
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

2596
02:45:31,538 --> 02:45:32,218
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, let us know.

2597
02:45:32,298 --> 02:45:33,118
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe next week.

2598
02:45:35,459 --> 02:45:36,660
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe it might take that long.

2599
02:45:36,780 --> 02:45:37,180
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

2600
02:45:37,260 --> 02:45:37,640
[SPEAKER_11]: Good luck.

2601
02:45:38,661 --> 02:45:38,981
[SPEAKER_11]: Take care.

2602
02:45:39,061 --> 02:45:39,421
[SPEAKER_11]: You too.

2603
02:45:40,682 --> 02:45:41,062
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

2604
02:45:41,082 --> 02:45:46,284
[SPEAKER_11]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.

2605
02:45:46,704 --> 02:45:47,345
[SPEAKER_11]: Give us a call.

2606
02:45:47,385 --> 02:45:47,845
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's walk.

2607
02:45:51,733 --> 02:45:54,676
[SPEAKER_15]: I liked his little icon on Skype because it was Daria.

2608
02:45:54,816 --> 02:45:55,557
[SPEAKER_11]: It was Daria.

2609
02:45:55,617 --> 02:45:56,558
[SPEAKER_11]: You love Daria, right?

2610
02:45:56,658 --> 02:45:56,998
[SPEAKER_11]: I do.

2611
02:45:57,158 --> 02:45:58,439
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, Doctor, you ready for another call?

2612
02:45:58,479 --> 02:45:58,720
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure.

2613
02:45:58,900 --> 02:45:59,160
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2614
02:46:00,401 --> 02:46:01,923
[SPEAKER_06]: You're online with Orange Lounge Radio.

2615
02:46:01,943 --> 02:46:02,583
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the Doctor.

2616
02:46:02,823 --> 02:46:03,164
[SPEAKER_06]: What's up?

2617
02:46:04,044 --> 02:46:05,306
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, it's Salacious Pop.

2618
02:46:06,327 --> 02:46:07,548
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, what's up, Salacious Pop?

2619
02:46:08,128 --> 02:46:08,569
[SPEAKER_08]: Not much.

2620
02:46:08,849 --> 02:46:14,314
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm calling in so everyone can hear my hot, sexy, I have a chest cold bro voice.

2621
02:46:15,030 --> 02:46:16,111
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, I love the bro voice.

2622
02:46:16,471 --> 02:46:21,835
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I'm going to go put on a Dave Matthews band CD and put on a visor sideways.

2623
02:46:22,355 --> 02:46:23,376
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.

2624
02:46:23,996 --> 02:46:24,496
[SPEAKER_06]: Great visual.

2625
02:46:24,516 --> 02:46:26,858
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, keep talking, keep talking.

2626
02:46:27,198 --> 02:46:33,162
[SPEAKER_08]: I was calling about Ranma's comment that Mad Catz really just needs to stop making controllers.

2627
02:46:33,322 --> 02:46:33,582
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

2628
02:46:33,642 --> 02:46:34,983
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a little story about that.

2629
02:46:35,263 --> 02:46:37,805
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.

2630
02:46:37,905 --> 02:46:43,629
[SPEAKER_08]: I bought one of their 8-in-1 memory sticks for the Dreamcast where it has a switch on it.

2631
02:46:44,494 --> 02:46:45,735
[SPEAKER_08]: It died after like a month.

2632
02:46:45,795 --> 02:46:46,836
[SPEAKER_08]: It deleted all my saves.

2633
02:46:47,597 --> 02:46:49,638
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I love that it not only died, but it deleted them.

2634
02:46:49,718 --> 02:46:50,599
[SPEAKER_06]: That's amazing.

2635
02:46:51,160 --> 02:47:02,369
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and then since he was talking about controllers, I bought a Blanca 6 button, the fighting pad for the 360 when Street Fighter 4 came out.

2636
02:47:03,430 --> 02:47:06,252
[SPEAKER_08]: And I got it off, I think eBay was brand new.

2637
02:47:06,332 --> 02:47:09,595
[SPEAKER_08]: It was in like the horrible clamshell where you need like a box cutter and a...

2638
02:47:10,069 --> 02:47:12,230
[SPEAKER_08]: I spent like 40 bucks on a Mad Catz controller that was just dead.

2639
02:47:12,250 --> 02:47:13,331
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, that's awesome.

2640
02:47:13,351 --> 02:47:13,891
[SPEAKER_06]: So they need to stop.

2641
02:47:32,803 --> 02:47:33,123
[SPEAKER_06]: Very good.

2642
02:47:33,143 --> 02:47:34,984
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I agree with all those stories.

2643
02:47:35,105 --> 02:47:38,266
[SPEAKER_06]: I would probably buy one just to step on it and kick it across the room.

2644
02:47:40,107 --> 02:47:41,088
[SPEAKER_08]: I can hear Rob giggling.

2645
02:47:41,688 --> 02:47:42,289
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi.

2646
02:47:42,889 --> 02:47:43,249
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi.

2647
02:47:43,529 --> 02:47:43,990
[SPEAKER_08]: Feel better?

2648
02:47:44,650 --> 02:47:44,910
[SPEAKER_08]: Fine.

2649
02:47:45,330 --> 02:47:46,311
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, since

2650
02:47:46,741 --> 02:47:48,923
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys are talking about the Tomb Raider reboot.

2651
02:47:49,083 --> 02:47:56,848
[SPEAKER_08]: I really think that no one care about Lara Croft anymore and that they need to put that franchise to bed because there are so many bad games associated with that.

2652
02:47:57,009 --> 02:47:57,689
[SPEAKER_11]: Hold on.

2653
02:47:57,789 --> 02:48:02,733
[SPEAKER_11]: You enjoyed that Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light game as much as I did unless you were lying for my benefit.

2654
02:48:03,393 --> 02:48:04,354
[SPEAKER_08]: No, see, that's the thing.

2655
02:48:04,414 --> 02:48:05,655
[SPEAKER_08]: That's an awesome game.

2656
02:48:06,355 --> 02:48:06,916
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it is.

2657
02:48:07,096 --> 02:48:11,259
[SPEAKER_08]: But because it has Lara Croft and Tomb Raider attached to it, like that's the brand.

2658
02:48:11,912 --> 02:48:15,074
[SPEAKER_08]: People are going to go, oh, ew, what's this shit, and they're not going to buy it.

2659
02:48:16,995 --> 02:48:22,659
[SPEAKER_08]: If that co-op game was put under a new IP with new characters, people would go, oh, this is a great game, because it is.

2660
02:48:23,380 --> 02:48:35,588
[SPEAKER_08]: But just, the Tomb Raider games for the PS2 were awful, 3, 4, and 5 for the PS1 were awful, so I just feel that this kind of box office poison, like, I don't know, she's, Lara Croft is...

2661
02:48:36,297 --> 02:48:38,798
[SPEAKER_08]: Lara Croft is the M. Night Shyamalan of video games?

2662
02:48:38,838 --> 02:48:39,438
[SPEAKER_08]: Pretty much.

2663
02:48:40,038 --> 02:48:40,839
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't care.

2664
02:48:41,379 --> 02:48:48,421
[SPEAKER_08]: She was genre-breaking in 96 with her platforming and her bad pyramid tits, but now no one cares.

2665
02:48:50,222 --> 02:48:50,922
[SPEAKER_11]: No one care.

2666
02:48:51,562 --> 02:48:57,424
[SPEAKER_08]: No one care about Lara Croft, which is a shame because I think that Eidos can still put out good games with her.

2667
02:48:57,604 --> 02:49:01,166
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just that she, as an icon, is bringing their ideas down.

2668
02:49:01,366 --> 02:49:01,726
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

2669
02:49:02,302 --> 02:49:04,863
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you think maybe they got one more chance?

2670
02:49:05,463 --> 02:49:09,704
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe this reboot, if it's really good, maybe people can look past it and forgive?

2671
02:49:10,124 --> 02:49:12,405
[SPEAKER_11]: Or no, it's over, put it past her?

2672
02:49:12,505 --> 02:49:20,107
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought the adventure game that they put out for her last year, or the year before, I think it was for the PS3, was also supposed to be really good.

2673
02:49:20,387 --> 02:49:23,388
[SPEAKER_08]: But again, I've never really heard of that.

2674
02:49:23,508 --> 02:49:27,389
[SPEAKER_08]: Once it came out, no one cared, and it never really broke any sales charts.

2675
02:49:28,393 --> 02:49:29,934
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think it may just be a done deal.

2676
02:49:30,114 --> 02:49:35,777
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess with the reboot, if they'd have to put a lot of money into marketing it, just saying, like, no, really, guys, this one's actually good.

2677
02:49:36,118 --> 02:49:40,881
[SPEAKER_11]: Or just put the topless patch in, honestly, and then boys everywhere will want to play, right?

2678
02:49:41,361 --> 02:49:43,542
[SPEAKER_08]: Just release it on PC in the skidding community.

2679
02:49:43,842 --> 02:49:44,823
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll take care of that for them.

2680
02:49:45,303 --> 02:49:45,784
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

2681
02:49:46,844 --> 02:49:48,405
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, anything else you want to share with the listeners?

2682
02:49:50,376 --> 02:49:51,017
[SPEAKER_08]: Nope, that's it.

2683
02:49:51,217 --> 02:49:55,400
[SPEAKER_08]: I managed to stave off having a coughing fit for a good two minutes, so I think now's a good time to leave.

2684
02:49:55,741 --> 02:49:57,362
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, feel better.

2685
02:49:57,442 --> 02:49:59,944
[SPEAKER_11]: Get better before Disneyland so I can spin you around in a teacup.

2686
02:50:00,405 --> 02:50:01,406
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay, I'll throw up on you.

2687
02:50:01,466 --> 02:50:01,806
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.

2688
02:50:01,946 --> 02:50:02,687
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, bye.

2689
02:50:03,067 --> 02:50:06,290
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, bye.

2690
02:50:06,310 --> 02:50:09,453
[SPEAKER_11]: 1-877-GAME-OLR He's funny, huh?

2691
02:50:09,653 --> 02:50:09,953
[SPEAKER_06]: He's funny.

2692
02:50:10,093 --> 02:50:11,014
[SPEAKER_06]: He's a good guy.

2693
02:50:11,194 --> 02:50:14,197
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, Orange Lounge Radio on Skype if you want to give us a call.

2694
02:50:15,757 --> 02:50:16,037
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, good lord.

2695
02:50:36,297 --> 02:50:38,558
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, how do you smell that all the way from where you're at?

2696
02:50:38,578 --> 02:50:40,880
[SPEAKER_11]: That's kind of, that's a little bit freaky, I don't know.

2697
02:50:41,780 --> 02:50:43,301
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, so.

2698
02:50:43,962 --> 02:50:46,343
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you have any other last minute stories, Loki, that you wanted to get to?

2699
02:50:50,085 --> 02:50:50,665
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

2700
02:50:50,726 --> 02:50:51,506
[SPEAKER_11]: Hold on, we're getting more calls.

2701
02:50:51,546 --> 02:50:52,687
[SPEAKER_11]: Now it's lighting up like crazy.

2702
02:50:52,827 --> 02:50:53,507
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's get to another call.

2703
02:50:53,567 --> 02:50:54,087
[SPEAKER_11]: Doctor, you ready?

2704
02:50:54,328 --> 02:50:54,488
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.

2705
02:50:55,728 --> 02:50:57,229
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for calling Orange Lounge Radio.

2706
02:50:57,269 --> 02:50:58,190
[SPEAKER_06]: You're online with the Doctor.

2707
02:50:58,370 --> 02:50:58,750
[SPEAKER_06]: What's up?

2708
02:50:59,491 --> 02:51:00,291
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, what's up?

2709
02:51:01,132 --> 02:51:01,432
[SPEAKER_06]: Not much.

2710
02:51:01,472 --> 02:51:02,012
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing?

2711
02:51:02,052 --> 02:51:03,173
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm online with the Doctor, I suppose.

2712
02:51:03,584 --> 02:51:03,964
[SPEAKER_06]: What's that?

2713
02:51:04,625 --> 02:51:05,546
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm on with the doctor.

2714
02:51:05,706 --> 02:51:06,486
[SPEAKER_06]: You're on with the doctor.

2715
02:51:06,526 --> 02:51:07,047
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm the doctor.

2716
02:51:08,288 --> 02:51:10,009
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any aliens I need to be worrying about then?

2717
02:51:10,950 --> 02:51:11,910
[SPEAKER_06]: There's tons of aliens, dude.

2718
02:51:11,930 --> 02:51:13,572
[SPEAKER_06]: I got my sonic screwdriver and I'm ready to go.

2719
02:51:14,321 --> 02:51:15,922
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh shit, I gotta run.

2720
02:51:17,022 --> 02:51:20,764
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh shit, we better, because there is an awful lot of running, so we definitely need to do that.

2721
02:51:21,484 --> 02:51:23,866
[SPEAKER_12]: Who are you talking to?

2722
02:51:24,786 --> 02:51:27,287
[SPEAKER_06]: So besides the aliens, what's going on tonight with you?

2723
02:51:27,487 --> 02:51:28,148
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, who is this?

2724
02:51:28,208 --> 02:51:28,888
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, who is this?

2725
02:51:29,548 --> 02:51:30,229
[SPEAKER_11]: This is Zappy.

2726
02:51:30,349 --> 02:51:30,989
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, Zappy.

2727
02:51:31,509 --> 02:51:31,889
[SPEAKER_11]: How are you?

2728
02:51:32,530 --> 02:51:33,030
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm pretty good.

2729
02:51:33,290 --> 02:51:34,371
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, let's talk to the doctor again.

2730
02:51:34,511 --> 02:51:34,711
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

2731
02:51:36,091 --> 02:51:41,012
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the reason I was talking to Colin was because it's sort of related to what Red Entertainment was talking about before.

2732
02:51:41,612 --> 02:51:45,193
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because I have a copy of Ruse for the Xbox 360.

2733
02:51:46,873 --> 02:51:50,354
[SPEAKER_00]: And let me tell you, that controller isn't cutting it.

2734
02:51:52,154 --> 02:51:59,455
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I can see it's a really good game, but you're just being held back by the horrible, horrible, horrible controls.

2735
02:52:01,315 --> 02:52:04,536
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I try and select my units and I'm always picking the wrong ones.

2736
02:52:05,129 --> 02:52:23,282
[SPEAKER_11]: and it's just not working I could see that because that's a lot of games in game room are kind of like that a Street Fighter 4 on the Xbox 360 kind of made me think that because it was just so awful to try and control but it's kind of a bummer that that controller really ruins some games

2737
02:52:24,434 --> 02:52:25,155
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2738
02:52:49,363 --> 02:52:51,484
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like a big gimmick to charge me $65.

2739
02:52:52,685 --> 02:52:57,428
[SPEAKER_11]: Isn't that terrible that they're only bundling it with that dumb play and charge or whatever it is?

2740
02:52:57,509 --> 02:53:00,070
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, oh, it's so annoying how they do this.

2741
02:53:00,150 --> 02:53:08,756
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just like Nintendo doing that new Nintendo remote with Wii Plus or whatever with a crappy tennis knockoff game.

2742
02:53:08,816 --> 02:53:09,357
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, really?

2743
02:53:10,437 --> 02:53:14,160
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, at least the Wii Sports Resort was at least, you know, fun.

2744
02:53:16,223 --> 02:53:18,024
[SPEAKER_11]: Super Metroid is like the holy grail of video games to me.

2745
02:53:45,857 --> 02:53:48,000
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, I love Super Metroid.

2746
02:53:48,100 --> 02:53:51,724
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they botched it, I'm really, really sad.

2747
02:53:52,905 --> 02:53:57,811
[SPEAKER_00]: My experience with New Metroid was about five minutes at Best Buy, and it seemed okay.

2748
02:53:58,532 --> 02:54:01,535
[SPEAKER_00]: But five minutes, I can't really say here or there.

2749
02:54:02,537 --> 02:54:05,460
[SPEAKER_00]: Could be good, just kind of made me honest.

2750
02:54:05,874 --> 02:54:12,095
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, you can't base an entire review of a game off of just five minutes, you know, because I'm sure everybody at E3 loved it.

2751
02:54:12,395 --> 02:54:15,516
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, the lines to play that game at E3 were like hours long.

2752
02:54:16,296 --> 02:54:19,917
[SPEAKER_11]: It was almost as long as the 3DS line at some points because it was moving a little slower.

2753
02:54:20,457 --> 02:54:20,937
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?

2754
02:54:21,217 --> 02:54:25,278
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess the people who couldn't get into the 3DS line said, okay, I'll sell for Metroid.

2755
02:54:25,338 --> 02:54:25,578
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

2756
02:54:26,578 --> 02:54:28,459
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe not hours, but like at least an hour.

2757
02:54:29,079 --> 02:54:30,579
[SPEAKER_11]: It's crazy how long lines get there.

2758
02:54:31,144 --> 02:54:35,626
[SPEAKER_00]: That reminds me, I'm getting my wallet raided this week to find out how much they'll be raping me out of my wallet.

2759
02:54:36,306 --> 02:54:36,606
[SPEAKER_00]: For?

2760
02:54:37,446 --> 02:54:37,967
[SPEAKER_00]: The 3DS.

2761
02:54:38,387 --> 02:54:39,007
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh.

2762
02:54:39,187 --> 02:54:40,348
[SPEAKER_11]: Are they announcing a date this week?

2763
02:54:41,048 --> 02:54:44,929
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, from what I'm hearing, they're probably going to announce it in the middle of this week.

2764
02:54:44,969 --> 02:54:45,810
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was Wednesday?

2765
02:54:46,010 --> 02:54:49,171
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right, because Nintendo doesn't do Tokyo Game Show, right?

2766
02:54:49,191 --> 02:54:53,273
[SPEAKER_11]: But they always do their own little kind of like spin-off, right?

2767
02:54:53,313 --> 02:54:56,114
[SPEAKER_11]: They do their own little fan event around the same time.

2768
02:54:56,134 --> 02:54:56,734
[SPEAKER_11]: Does that make sense?

2769
02:54:57,679 --> 02:55:24,617
[SPEAKER_11]: so I'm kind of like basically unless they're like charging a thousand bucks they basically got me locked down for that thing I'm gonna say it's probably gonna be $2.49 and it's gonna come with like either I think it'll be like kind of like a tech demo-y type of game that's just a bunch of like the movie trailers and some of the tech demos they were showing it on 3DS and then like Ocarina of Time in 3D or some old ass Nintendo IP that they can just easily do as the pack-in game

2770
02:55:25,322 --> 02:55:31,948
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they got me at launch for DS, and I bought the PSP within three months of launch, so I'm pretty sure I'm going to pick this up.

2771
02:55:32,008 --> 02:55:33,529
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you regret buying either of those systems?

2772
02:55:35,551 --> 02:55:37,433
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the PSP a little bit.

2773
02:55:38,934 --> 02:55:45,360
[SPEAKER_00]: The DS I've been having as a paperweight for the last six months, there really hasn't been anything coming out this year for it.

2774
02:55:46,132 --> 02:55:50,014
[SPEAKER_11]: No, yeah, they didn't really show a lot at E3 either because it's all about the 3DS now.

2775
02:55:50,535 --> 02:55:52,916
[SPEAKER_11]: Except for the little girl games like Fancy Nancy.

2776
02:55:53,737 --> 02:55:56,918
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing that seems interesting coming out is maybe Pokemon in black and white.

2777
02:55:57,199 --> 02:55:57,779
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's true.

2778
02:55:57,999 --> 02:55:59,340
[SPEAKER_11]: That's going to be a big deal when it comes out.

2779
02:56:00,160 --> 02:56:01,461
[SPEAKER_00]: But otherwise, I just don't see much.

2780
02:56:01,481 --> 02:56:02,862
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's Final Fantasy?

2781
02:56:02,942 --> 02:56:04,043
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't like Pokemon.

2782
02:56:05,844 --> 02:56:06,124
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

2783
02:56:06,564 --> 02:56:09,406
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, Zappy, any other thoughts for the listeners before we let you go tonight?

2784
02:56:11,110 --> 02:56:11,951
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't buy rules on the 360.

2785
02:56:11,991 --> 02:56:16,959
[SPEAKER_00]: The PC is probably the best choice and maybe the PlayStation Move version.

2786
02:56:17,854 --> 02:56:18,254
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

2787
02:56:18,755 --> 02:56:21,036
[SPEAKER_11]: Word of warning of caution to the listeners.

2788
02:56:21,677 --> 02:56:21,857
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

2789
02:56:21,877 --> 02:56:22,637
[SPEAKER_11]: You have a good one, Zappy.

2790
02:56:22,677 --> 02:56:23,178
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for the call.

2791
02:56:23,738 --> 02:56:23,958
[SPEAKER_11]: Later.

2792
02:56:24,178 --> 02:56:24,398
[SPEAKER_11]: Later.

2793
02:56:24,679 --> 02:56:24,959
[SPEAKER_11]: Later.

2794
02:56:25,359 --> 02:56:25,659
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

2795
02:56:25,679 --> 02:56:27,060
[SPEAKER_11]: That's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

2796
02:56:27,080 --> 02:56:29,082
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you guys so much for all the calls tonight.

2797
02:56:29,682 --> 02:56:30,943
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry to those that didn't get through.

2798
02:56:31,103 --> 02:56:34,985
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, you should have called when we first opened it because it was wide open.

2799
02:56:35,025 --> 02:56:37,167
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm so sorry, guys, but we got to wrap up and get out of here tonight.

2800
02:56:37,187 --> 02:56:38,788
[SPEAKER_06]: My friend Frodo got through at the very beginning.

2801
02:56:39,809 --> 02:56:40,269
[SPEAKER_11]: Clearly.

2802
02:56:40,529 --> 02:56:48,974
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, by the way, for those that are angry they didn't get through on tonight, you can thank that first call for eating up 30 seconds of your time, just so you know.

2803
02:56:49,394 --> 02:56:49,875
[SPEAKER_11]: There you go.

2804
02:56:51,495 --> 02:56:51,856
[SPEAKER_11]: I know.

2805
02:56:53,136 --> 02:56:55,398
[SPEAKER_11]: Quickly, any other last minute stories Loki wants to get out?

2806
02:56:55,678 --> 02:56:58,259
[SPEAKER_11]: Any plants versus zombies action DarkSakura wants to share?

2807
02:56:59,400 --> 02:57:01,181
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm currently owning a bunch of zombies.

2808
02:57:01,241 --> 02:57:04,183
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what that game needs, and maybe it has it, and I don't know, multiplayer.

2809
02:57:05,164 --> 02:57:06,764
[SPEAKER_11]: The Xbox 360 version, it does.

2810
02:57:07,305 --> 02:57:07,745
[SPEAKER_11]: Does it?

2811
02:57:08,265 --> 02:57:09,206
[SPEAKER_11]: They've added it, yeah.

2812
02:57:10,020 --> 02:57:10,561
[SPEAKER_11]: That's cool.

2813
02:57:10,601 --> 02:57:11,402
[SPEAKER_11]: I might have to play it on the 360.

2814
02:57:12,384 --> 02:57:13,765
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just playing a little puzzle mode.

2815
02:57:14,386 --> 02:57:18,152
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if this was mentioned before because I haven't been paying a lot of attention.

2816
02:57:18,913 --> 02:57:23,399
[SPEAKER_09]: Plants vs. Zombies is now becoming a quest in World of Warcraft Cataclysm.

2817
02:57:24,401 --> 02:57:25,162
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's pretty awesome.

2818
02:57:25,390 --> 02:57:27,912
[SPEAKER_11]: Peacebloom vs. Ghouls or whatever they're calling it.

2819
02:57:27,972 --> 02:57:28,832
[SPEAKER_11]: It's hilarious.

2820
02:57:29,513 --> 02:57:31,074
[SPEAKER_09]: I want the sunflower pet, not gonna lie.

2821
02:57:32,635 --> 02:57:37,318
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, there is a fan release of the Command & Conquer 3, The Forgotten.

2822
02:57:37,498 --> 02:57:43,702
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a brand new expansion for Command & Conquer 3 and the best part about it, it's fan made.

2823
02:57:43,862 --> 02:57:54,069
[SPEAKER_09]: So, go check it out at theforgotten.cnclabs.com and check out the new units and different things you get to play around with.

2824
02:57:54,509 --> 02:57:55,110
[SPEAKER_09]: So, that's kind of cool.

2825
02:57:55,790 --> 02:57:56,631
[SPEAKER_02]: You said unit.

2826
02:57:57,411 --> 02:58:09,257
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, World of Warcraft, I guess, mobile guild chat is coming to World of Warcraft, I believe via the World of Warcraft Armory, which is an iPhone, iPad, or iPod Android device app.

2827
02:58:10,198 --> 02:58:13,259
[SPEAKER_11]: But you probably have to pay the premium that you have to pay.

2828
02:58:13,279 --> 02:58:15,400
[SPEAKER_09]: It is a $2.99 monthly subscription fee.

2829
02:58:16,821 --> 02:58:21,083
[SPEAKER_11]: Not gonna lie, though, it's extremely homosexual.

2830
02:58:21,443 --> 02:58:22,164
[SPEAKER_09]: It is homosexual.

2831
02:58:22,184 --> 02:58:22,484
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

2832
02:58:23,044 --> 02:58:25,865
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, to be honest, I'm not going to lie, it actually sounds kind of cool.

2833
02:58:25,965 --> 02:58:27,106
[SPEAKER_11]: You would use that.

2834
02:58:27,346 --> 02:58:31,427
[SPEAKER_11]: Being able to sign on and just say, hey, I'm on the toilet.

2835
02:58:31,467 --> 02:58:32,148
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, I just spent $3.

2836
02:58:32,188 --> 02:58:40,911
[SPEAKER_09]: Couldn't you, I don't know, just sign up for some other sort of, I'm sure there's other voice chat options, perhaps through Skype.

2837
02:58:40,991 --> 02:58:42,411
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not really going to get it.

2838
02:58:42,912 --> 02:58:48,014
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, through Skype, which is free, and I'm sure you can do some sort of party chat with that.

2839
02:58:48,074 --> 02:58:49,834
[SPEAKER_11]: Ventrilo on the iPhone, that's what I need.

2840
02:58:49,934 --> 02:58:51,475
[SPEAKER_11]: Do they have that, chatters?

2841
02:58:52,095 --> 02:58:55,417
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be crazy if they did.

2842
02:58:55,477 --> 02:58:58,178
[SPEAKER_11]: Amiga77 says, you mean it's homotextual.

2843
02:58:59,759 --> 02:59:00,419
[SPEAKER_11]: That was funny.

2844
02:59:00,479 --> 02:59:01,239
[SPEAKER_15]: I like that.

2845
02:59:03,060 --> 02:59:03,581
[SPEAKER_15]: So cute.

2846
02:59:04,641 --> 02:59:06,522
[SPEAKER_15]: The baby, not homotextual.

2847
02:59:06,622 --> 02:59:06,862
[SPEAKER_11]: I know.

2848
02:59:08,023 --> 02:59:08,283
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

2849
02:59:08,323 --> 02:59:10,544
[SPEAKER_11]: Anything else you want to share, Loki, the last of the stories?

2850
02:59:11,404 --> 02:59:11,464
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

2851
02:59:11,484 --> 02:59:12,285
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

2852
02:59:12,625 --> 02:59:14,746
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, anything you've got over there?

2853
02:59:15,979 --> 02:59:16,839
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that's what I thought.

2854
02:59:16,939 --> 02:59:17,900
[SPEAKER_11]: More plants versus zombies.

2855
02:59:18,200 --> 02:59:20,481
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

2856
02:59:20,521 --> 02:59:22,982
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you guys so much for tuning in and listening to our show tonight.

2857
02:59:23,282 --> 02:59:24,163
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what we always say.

2858
02:59:24,203 --> 02:59:26,684
[SPEAKER_11]: If you guys like what you hear, please help us spread the word.

2859
02:59:26,984 --> 02:59:28,604
[SPEAKER_11]: Tell two people you know about the show.

2860
02:59:29,125 --> 02:59:31,286
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you didn't like what you heard, oh well.

2861
02:59:31,546 --> 02:59:32,806
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, it didn't work out for you.

2862
02:59:33,326 --> 02:59:36,148
[SPEAKER_11]: But continue to support independent podcasts and independent radio.

2863
02:59:36,168 --> 02:59:42,110
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a whole lot of great shows at allgames.com or seriously, just go into iTunes and look for some independent shows.

2864
02:59:42,610 --> 02:59:43,711
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a lot of really great stuff.

2865
02:59:44,071 --> 02:59:44,971
[SPEAKER_14]: And, and, and.

2866
02:59:45,252 --> 02:59:45,412
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

2867
02:59:45,532 --> 02:59:51,994
[SPEAKER_14]: I would also like to make a mention of Comic Insanity, the other podcast that I record.

2868
02:59:52,314 --> 02:59:53,194
[SPEAKER_14]: Cheap plug, cheap plug.

2869
02:59:53,214 --> 02:59:53,755
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it's all good.

2870
02:59:54,035 --> 02:59:58,276
[SPEAKER_14]: With Tiara and Shadow.

2871
02:59:59,157 --> 03:00:00,197
[SPEAKER_14]: And we're really awesome.

2872
03:00:00,217 --> 03:00:03,938
[SPEAKER_14]: And you can find us at infamous, it's infamous without the I, .net.

2873
03:00:06,883 --> 03:00:09,324
[SPEAKER_11]: And the Robin Extra for Warcraft show is still in development.

2874
03:00:10,184 --> 03:00:11,444
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going to happen soon.

2875
03:00:11,504 --> 03:00:17,266
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's just we're having problems being able to tape it like at the same, you know, just our schedules kind of conflict.

2876
03:00:17,306 --> 03:00:19,926
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we haven't been able to get the Skype thing to work.

2877
03:00:19,966 --> 03:00:21,107
[SPEAKER_11]: So we have to tape it in person.

2878
03:00:21,267 --> 03:00:23,407
[SPEAKER_11]: And now I don't have all the recording stuff at my house.

2879
03:00:23,707 --> 03:00:25,208
[SPEAKER_15]: And you're too busy playing WoW.

2880
03:00:25,468 --> 03:00:27,028
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I can tear myself away from WoW for that.

2881
03:00:27,388 --> 03:00:27,748
[SPEAKER_11]: And I do.

2882
03:00:28,169 --> 03:00:29,949
[SPEAKER_11]: But that's that.

2883
03:00:32,557 --> 03:00:34,479
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm being whispered secret messages from DarkSakura.

2884
03:00:34,500 --> 03:00:35,901
[SPEAKER_11]: She's whispering sweet nothings in my ear.

2885
03:00:36,121 --> 03:00:36,422
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my.

2886
03:00:36,662 --> 03:00:37,043
[SPEAKER_11]: Good times.

2887
03:00:38,089 --> 03:00:38,590
[SPEAKER_11]: So there we go.

2888
03:00:38,770 --> 03:00:39,631
[SPEAKER_11]: That's going to do it for another show.

2889
03:00:39,651 --> 03:00:41,312
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's go around and give everybody's final thought.
