Hello my friends out there on the internet

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
And welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
We are that show dedicated to video games

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
Video gaming, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
All of it, we're the place where every gamer has a voice

00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
And leading the charge over the next few hours are myself

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000

Om nom nom

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
How are you?

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
Orange Lounge Foodio going on over there

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
I slept most of the day

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
Awesome, Orange Lounge Nappio

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
I took an awesome nap yesterday actually

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
And that's how I was able to stay up late

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
Because I went clubbing and I was able to stay up until like 2am

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
It was fun

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
It sounds like you had a good time

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
I had a great time

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
I'm just very proud of myself because I used the cucumber that I grew myself

01:18.000 --> 01:22.000
And I made myself some salad and it's fantastic

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
Soon you're going to be moving into a commune

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
And starting your own

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
Okay

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
I have five plants that I'm growing in the backyard

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
And three of them are like stuff to season with

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
Remember the fort?

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
The fort?

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
The fort

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
It was, oh this was years ago in OLR history

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
This was probably around like

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
When DDR Angel first started coming to the show

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
Probably around like episode like 30-ish right

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
And she had a friend

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
And I can't remember the dude's name

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
I'm a horrible, well I remember his real name

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
I don't want to say it on the show

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
It was D-U

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
Yeah

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
Yeah okay

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
I think I remember because

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
Right?

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
But he lived out in the middle of nowhere right

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
And to get to his house

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
He had to go by this place in the middle of nowhere

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
With all these signs that were like keep out

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
And trespassers will be shot on sight

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
And it just looked like some dude

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
Has had himself holed up in there since the 60s

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
And we decided to call that the OLR fort

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
Oh yeah

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
And that's who we're all going to move into remember

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
I remember

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
The fort

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
Oh

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
I can't remember all this stuff

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
Oh good times

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
Your brain works better than mine does today

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
That's alright

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
Say hello to the one and only tech master Loki

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
Hello

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
How are you?

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
Hi

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
Happy birthday Loki

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
Thank you

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
Is your mic on?

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
I don't know if we're even hearing you

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
It is on

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
It is on but for some reason we are not hearing you at all

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
I screwed with the volume

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
I don't think we screwed with it at all

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
Are you guys hearing Loki?

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
I have the crappy mic

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
I don't know what's going on here

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
Live radio and I'm not sure

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
I guess we are hearing Loki

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
He's just not as loud as the others

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
No I'm not even sure

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
No you're not on at all

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
That's oh you know what

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
Good ol'

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
Ah they plugged me in the wrong hole

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
There you go

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
Hi Loki

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
See this is what happens when you put it in the wrong hole okay

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
Let's try that again

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
And the one and only tech master Loki

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
Hello

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
Hi how are you doing?

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
I'm tired

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
I plugged it in the out hole

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
Oops

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
That's what happens

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
Well happy birthday a little late

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
Thank you

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
That's right

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
Never forget September 11th Loki's birthday

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
No I'm being a little bit silly

03:19.000 --> 03:22.000
You don't have any tragedies on your birthday do you?

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
Ah no but I do have a victory

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
My birthday

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
There's two reasons my birthday rocks

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
One it's the day that Strom Thurmond died

03:31.000 --> 03:35.000
And B it's the day that sodomy laws were overturned in Texas

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
That's what I get on my birthday

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
See my birthday was the Waco thing

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
Oh was it?

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
Yeah

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
Oh no no tragedies on my birthday yet

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
Just victories

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
Bitch

03:44.000 --> 03:49.000
So talking about something funny made out of tragedy I guess

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
There's this pet and feed store that's near my house or whatever

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
And they have this horse statue that's out in front of

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
Like a full size horse statue that's out in front of their building

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
And they dress it up you know to

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
For like Halloween or you know St. Paddy's Day

04:05.000 --> 04:09.000
All the different stuff they dress it up themed like that

04:09.000 --> 04:13.000
So they decided hey we're gonna dress it up for 9-11

04:13.000 --> 04:20.000
And so this horse has a replica of the twin towers on its back

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
And it's like

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
That almost sounds tacky

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
It is extremely tacky

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
I get wanting to be patriotic

04:26.000 --> 04:31.000
And I do think they kind of should make a day out of 9-11 as a remembrance

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
And a day to kind of celebrate all things American

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
Although I realize it's also like the 4th of July as it is

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
But you know what I mean

04:37.000 --> 04:42.000
Like it's too bad that that had to happen on your birthday

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
But it's just you know some people are born on Christmas

04:45.000 --> 04:49.000
Some people are born on you know the day sodomy laws are repealed

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
Some people are born on 9-11

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
And you know it's just a birthday

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
Yeah what can you do

04:56.000 --> 05:00.000
At least if you're born on Easter you don't always have to have it again on Easter

05:00.000 --> 05:04.000
True or if you're born February 29th you get to stay young for a very long time

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
Even though you look really old for your age

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
Yes

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
Alright anyhow

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
Let's start I guess with a little bit of How's Your Gaming Week

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
Oh I should say about the marathon

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
I want to thank the listeners first off

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
The marathon was awesome

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
And if you haven't heard it all it's all up on the feed now

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
We went for 10 and a half hours live

05:19.000 --> 05:24.000
But when you take out the music it was about 9 hours 30-40 minutes worth of podcast

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
In good times

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
And we didn't end up playing any games live on air like we thought we were going to

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
So just really good times

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
We did match games

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
No no no I meant video games

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
Oh

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
On air not the OLR games

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
But yeah I mean and big thanks to Alan and Bradley too

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
Dan sure did

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
Without their help

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
Dan

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
He played the game that shall not be named

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
For a very long time

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
Yet

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
Yes he was playing the Reach Around game for some time

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
He and his friend

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
That's what they finished

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
Yes he and Alex were playing Reach Around

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
For a while

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
Has he finished the game yet

05:53.000 --> 05:58.000
I have no idea Dan left for Washington State to go spend like 8 days with his family and

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
Leave me here by my you

06:00.000 --> 06:04.000
Oh whatever you're going to run around the house naked and play Star Trek online

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
That's what I do anyway

06:05.000 --> 06:09.000
Well not during the show thankfully

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
I was playing it when you came in the house

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
With her clothes on thankfully

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
Yes

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
I'm wearing my stylish X-Men t-shirt

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
But it's why she probably had the door locked

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
So when I banged on the door she was like oh shit where's my bra

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
Alright anyway

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
Oh bored fat fat fat

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
Alright uh ew

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
How was your gaming week Dark Soccer besides naked Star Trek

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
I wasn't naked

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
I was playing Star Trek online when Rob came in

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
And I actually stopped in the middle of the part that I was on

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
Because when I start the game I'll just start right back from where I am

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
Which is a very good thing about Star Trek online

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
Unless you're like right at the beginning of it

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
And you're almost done with the first part and then you die

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
Anyway um

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
I played Peggle

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
You know I haven't touched Epic Citadel since I downloaded it

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
Except to upgrade it

06:52.000 --> 06:56.000
And I really haven't done much else in the way of gaming

06:56.000 --> 06:59.000
Well Dan got uh

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
Not

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
Dead Rising 2

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
I always want to say Left 4 Dead but

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
It's Dead Rising 2 the Mission Zero

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
K-Zero

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
And he's gotten all of the endings except

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
Man the bad ending where the little girl turns into a zombie

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
OMG spoilers

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
Don't care

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
If you haven't downloaded it yet and if you haven't got there by now

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
Then I don't want to hear it

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
Plus it's kind of obvious

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
It doesn't even show her turning into a zombie

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
Well I mean she's a child

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
I don't care I wanted to see a zombie five year old

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
I'm sorry you were disappointed

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
I mean it's like when you watch zombie movies

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
Okay okay

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
When you watch zombie movies right

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
Shouldn't there be like zombie dogs and children

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
And zombie old people

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
And

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
You know and like zombies in wheelchairs

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
Well actually there wasn't Shaun of the Dead

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
I suppose it depends on how graphic you want to get

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
Like and all the people in hospitals turning into zombies and stuff

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
It's

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
It just doesn't make sense to me

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
But yeah

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
I also have that problem with zombie video games

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
It was pretty cool though

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
Especially my favorite weapon that you can make in that game

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
Is you can get a pitchfork

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
And attach it to a rifle

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
And then you can stab them with a pitchfork

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
Pull them up in the air and shoot them with a shotgun

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
And they'll explode

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
That's awesome

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
And you can also go to this place and get a broadsword

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
And slice zombies down the middle

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
And like you can make like the nail bat and everything

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
But man the pitchfork bayonet

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
That's innovation

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
I haven't figured out any weapon combinations

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
Outside of the nails and bat

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
Only because I was specifically shown that at E3

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
How to do that

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
Pitchfork, rifle

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
Well you try to figure stuff out

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
And then also you get cards

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
And you can take all that stuff into the main game later on

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
And it even has a dude throwing up

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
Hooray

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
Yes

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
And then you can tape him to a cat

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
And he becomes a weapon right

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
But I do love that idea

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
It certainly seems one step past

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
The Fable 2 pub games

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
Which was a neat little innovation in itself

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
But this is kind of like taking it to the next level

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
Where like now a games demo

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
Is actually a whole different game

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
And yeah you pay for it

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
But it's kind of a standalone experience

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
And you know you get to take what you've earned into the main game

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
It's kind of neat

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
And it's got three different endings

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
It's reverse DLC

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
It's not download content to expand the game

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
It's very strange

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
But I like it

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
It was really cool

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
When Dan did one of the bad endings

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
He had the dude with the mohawk wearing a waitress dress

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
And I was like

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
Okay that's pretty funny

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
Because you see this burly guy walking in

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
Wearing this dress

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
And then falling to his knees

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
I can't wait to see some of the hideous costumes you can put the main character in

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
Because I'll tell you what

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
Some of the best parts of the first one

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
Were some of the really skanky costumes

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
And the random and children's clothing

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
And the Mega Man outfit

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
This one's set in Las Vegas isn't it?

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
Yes

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
So we need to have the whole showgirls

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
You know big fantail

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
And we have to go find Tiara Zombie

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
Because she lives in Vegas

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
And undoubtedly be a zombie in the game

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
We won't aim for the head on the Tiara Zombie

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
I'll refrain from using the pitchfork bayonetta

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
On Tiara

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
What I'll do I'll put a cardboard box on her head

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
And just watch her run around

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
In the garden playing PS2 games

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
Like in Shaun of the Dead

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
I can't wait to see what kind of comment we get from her

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
Because she's on AOL during the show right?

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
Yeah I don't know I have to ask her if she's listening

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
Let's see going to our chatroom

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
At chat.orangelaunchradio.com

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
Let's see a hitstun suggests a cat gun

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
To which actdeft is saying laser cat gun

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
That would be a great weapon

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
I could see using a laser cat

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
That would be amazing

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
Loki how was your gaming week?

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
Pretty eventful actually

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
Because we did our game summit thing

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
At our work where we invite publishers

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
And some of our customers out

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
And we did it this year kind of

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
Expo style I guess

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
Each publisher had a different booth

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
For the ones that showed up

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
Not that many bright games though

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
Even though I offered them like

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
Hey if you need to borrow a 360 or something

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
I can help you out with that

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
So I only played really

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
Like a few different things

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
The first one

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
And there is a video out there

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
Of it somewhere I don't want to know

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
Where though

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
The first game I played this week was

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
Just Dance 2

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
And only because

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
The Ubisoft rep wanted

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
To demonstrate it and no one would play it

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
So I was like okay fine

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
I'll do this and be a good sport about it

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
So I did that

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
And she kicked my ass in every single song

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
Even though she says she didn't play it before

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
I don't believe her

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
It was actually kind of fun

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
It's kind of neat because the game itself

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
If you haven't played it yet

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
It's going to be very similar to what Dance Central

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
I guess is going to be

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
It pretty much just plays like that

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
And all you do is you hold the remote

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
And you just kind of mimic what's on the screen

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
And it will just kind of

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
It'll only detect what you're doing with the remote

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
But it's still pretty close

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
And it's fun

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
And it's got some decent songs in there

12:11.000 --> 12:15.000
Did you jam to TikTok?

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
Did you get your Kesha on?

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
Yes we did actually

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
Why?

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
Why is this not on YouTube?

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
Why is there not video of Loki playing Just Dance 2?

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
I am so upset

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
We mean why is this on YouTube?

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
It is on YouTube

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
Oh my god where?

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
I don't know

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
There is video of you on YouTube playing Just Dance 2

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
I don't see it

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
Tiger Claw

12:41.000 --> 12:45.000
He's the best web scavenger I know

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
Tiger Claw needs to find this somehow

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
Use your Google Fu Ninja abilities

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
I don't know if my boss has uploaded it yet

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
Because they were taking video

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
Oh man as soon as this is up you've got to tell me

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
Yeah I do I guess

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
Anyways

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
Try not to sound too excited

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
Yeah

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
I'm going to see if I can find

13:09.000 --> 13:13.000
I'm sorry you can find it later

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
I don't want to cause too much dead air while you search

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
Yeah no problem

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
Anyways

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
So other than Just Dance 2 I got to play around with some of the move demo stuff

13:21.000 --> 13:27.000
I played actually the full version of Sports Champions

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
Which is kind of fun

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
I kind of like the archery that's in the game

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
And that was pretty cool

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
It sucks though because at the time though

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
They had this kit that they had

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
Or it was actually one of the retail

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
Not 4

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
250GB systems that they're going to be selling

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
With Sports Champions bundled in there and stuff

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
So they have

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
You can play a lot of these games

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
Like the archery stuff

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
Either with two of the move controllers

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
Or one controller

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
So the one controller has it

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
You take the move and you kind of

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
Put it over your shoulder like you're pulling an arrow out of a quiver

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
And then you kind of point it at the screen

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
That way

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
And it actually worked really well

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
And then I also played some of the frisbee golf

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
Which was kind of fun

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
But I'm horrible at frisbee golf

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
I tried a little bit of the table tennis

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
I don't care for the table tennis too much

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
But

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
How did archery in the PlayStation Move sports game

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
Compare to archery in Wii sport resort

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
Or whatever

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
I haven't played Wii sports resort yet

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
But I think it would be way more accurate

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
Than it is

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
It's just

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
I don't know, it just felt right

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
I guess

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
I haven't played it with two of the

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
Two of the controllers yet

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
I do have my own kit now

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
I have two of the move controllers

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
Which Rob was

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
Sticking on his chest earlier

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
And I'm sure there's pictures online

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
I would not say that those pictures exist on Twitter

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
He wouldn't say that

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
No

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
So I got to play that

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
Well it makes sense to me

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
Sony decided to release

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
Some of the move required games

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
On the 7th

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
Of September

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
And while that may be the case

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
You're not going to find them in stores

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
Because

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
Like most smart stores

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
They're not going to overnight some product

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
To their stores

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
So that it can't be played for a week

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
Thus frustrating people

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
So actually

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
I got to play this by today

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
And no one had any of the stuff that's already out

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
For the move

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
Which is disappointing because I have just the demos to play right now

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
Which is fine, they're still fun

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
Another demo I checked out was

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
Ipet

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
And I got to say Ipet is retarded

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
And it really does not work

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
It seems like a neat idea at first

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
But you mean

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
To actually get it so that it looks right

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
You have to get the camera at

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
The perfect angle

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
For a crappy

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
Itoy game

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
Way back in the Playstation 2

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
And stuff

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
It's not good at all

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
It doesn't lend well to the argument that

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
This is just the itoy all over again

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
It does not

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
Thankfully that's the only game that's the case

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
With

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
They have you

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
Do a few different things

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
For example they have you

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
Play with

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
Him I guess you move your fingers

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
And he's supposed to roll over

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
And stuff

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
And it just did not detect that

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
It was just having trouble figuring out what I was trying to do

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
And then it had me

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
Draw an airplane

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
And he'd fly around in it

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
And I don't know what the

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
Problem was with this but for some reason

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
I'm pretty good at tracing

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
Outlines and stuff

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
Like on the Wii and the DS

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
And that kind of thing

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
When you see outline for the plane

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
Using the Playstation move controller

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
It looked like crap

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
It just was not working too well

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
But you know hey whatever

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
It's a crappy game to begin with

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
And then also they have you trying to wash him

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
And the problem is I couldn't tell

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
Like I had trouble figuring out

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
You know whether my move controller

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
Was in front or behind him

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
And stuff like that so I had to kind of try to figure out

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
Where to turn it in perspective

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
It's just very awkward

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
But I mean most people will figure out

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
That it's a waste of time anyways

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
Then what else did I try

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
I tried the Tiger Woods demo

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
And that worked alright

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
It's just very difficult to get it set up

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
So that

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
It you know

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
So you can use the move controller

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
At least I found that it was kind of difficult to get it set up

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
Oh and calibrating it's actually pretty easy

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
As far as

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
Because I was reading some reviews

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
You know for different things

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
They had to constantly calibrate the controller

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
I didn't find that to be the case actually

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
With sports champions you calibrate it once

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
And you're good to go

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
So that was kind of cool

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
And I'm trying to think of what else I played

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
That was kind of fun

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
I tried the

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
It's like that

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
Some kung fu game

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
Where you actually

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
Roll down the street on like office chairs

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
And that was crap

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
It did not control well

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
Sports champions is fun

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
Wasn't there a mini game in

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
Incredible Crisis where you go down the street

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
In a chair no it's on a

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
Gurney

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
Yes it's on the hospital bed yeah

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
Looking at our chat room chat

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
BlackWolf is in our chat

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
The good pal of ours that does the show before us

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
Live at All Games Radio

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
When we tape live on Sunday nights

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
He says oh cool I didn't realize that move was coming out on Friday

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
And not Sunday originally it was coming out on Sunday

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
Yeah they kept moving it around

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
In fact the Sony reps had trouble remembering

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
What day it was supposed to be coming out on

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
But yeah it's Friday now not Sunday

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
Although there are some games coming out on Sunday

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
But you don't really need to mess with those

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
It's just the Brunswick bowling game

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
So would you be paying money for this?

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
Would I be paying money for it?

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
If you didn't already have it in your hot little hands

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
Would you pay money for it?

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
I might but the problem is I don't know how much

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
I'm going to play with this

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
But it's pretty fun

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
It's definitely

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
If you like the Wii stuff you're going to probably like this

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
But it is a lot more sensitive

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
I think so they kind of took

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
What they did on the Wii and improved

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
Upon it which is good so

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
As long as they come out with

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
Good games for it then I don't think it's

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
A bad investment at all

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
And the best part about it

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
This is like a lot of the stuff

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
You probably don't need to get the navigation controller

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
For because most of the games don't use it

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
Oh wow

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
Really you're only going to use the navigation controller

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
You're going to be playing like SoCom or Killzone 3

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
I think

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
I got to admit I'm not sure it's the greatest idea

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
That they do this whole

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
Separate skews

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
For like a camera

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
A camera and

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
One controller, a controller

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
And the navigation

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
It kind of seems like it's too complicated to figure out

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
What you need and with all these different

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
Peripherals out there

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
It's tough for the designer

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
I like that they did that though because I own a camera

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
Now that I've got the kit

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
I've got two cameras for no reason

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
But the whole optional navigation controller

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
Which I guess is true on the Wii to an extent

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
But every Wii comes with one at least

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
So the designers know they can do at least one

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
Well technically it still comes with one

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
Because it comes with a regular DualShock controller

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
Which can double as the navigation controller

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
If you want it to

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
So if you really

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
It's kind of awkward to hold it

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
Because you have to hold it with one hand

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
But I mean

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
If you really care then you can use that

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
As a navigation controller

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
If for example

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
Like you're playing Killzone 3

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
Or something like that and you want to try out the move

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
Controls and you have a move controller

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
But you don't have the navigation controller

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
You can get by with that

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
But you may want to get an actual navigation controller

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
Later on

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
Looking at our chat room live on this Sunday night

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
At chat.orangeloungeradio.com

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
Tigerclaw is saying, speaking of move

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
Sony launched an anti-connect site about the buttons

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
YayButtons.com

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
I'd heard about this but I didn't

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
It wasn't on our list for tonight

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
Have you looked at this site at all?

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
Yeah I mean that's great that they have a campaign

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
About yay buttons and stuff like that

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
I do love that website name

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
I gotta say

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
Yay Buttons is a good name for a site

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
That's a stupid argument to make right now

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
Because

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
Even Microsoft came out and said

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
Well we never said that we can't have a game

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
That uses both the connect camera

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
And the controller

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
So you know

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
Hooray with your campaign and everything

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
And really all these games

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
That they have out there right now

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
Just use either the trigger

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
Or the top move button

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
Or basically the A and B button

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
On a Wii remote

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
Because a lot of these games play just like Wii games

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
I mean it's

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
What a shock

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
I know, what a shock that they play like Wii games

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
I don't know

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
It's kind of fun

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
I mean if you

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
If you're looking for something that's gonna be

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
Way better than the Wii

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
You're probably not gonna find it with this

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
Alright so what games

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
Do we have to look forward to on the move

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
That you're gonna be checking out for us?

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
Well the

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
You know

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
Sports Champions

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
That's pretty good

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
I actually haven't played it yet

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
But there's that

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
Time Crisis Raising Storm

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
That looked kind of fun

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
I like the Toy Story 3 game but

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
If it's too much money I wouldn't bother

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
It was cute though

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
It reminded me of Midway Mania

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
I might check out

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
I'm trying to think what else

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
I would probably pick up for that

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
I don't know

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
It's hard to say right now

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
I'm not gonna pick up

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
SOCOM

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
Maybe some of the PlayStation Network games

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
I'll just see whatever they throw my way

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
Cause I don't want to spend a lot of money

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
Alright

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
Well let's talk about My Gaming Week

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
Actually before we get to My Gaming Week though

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
I want to make a special phone call here a little bit

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
I'm gonna actually call

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
He was here last week on the show

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
He's Alan AKA Salacious Pop

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
AKA my boyfriend

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
Is sitting there at his computer

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
And he knows we're calling him cause I want to talk about something here tonight

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
Hey Alan are you there?

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
Yep

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
So Alan

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
You live in the Bay Area

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
In California right?

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
Yes

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
And you don't live that far away from where there was actually

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
A really bad tragedy this week right?

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
Yep

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
Tell us a little bit about what happened

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
Thursday evening at about 615

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
A giant gas main

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
Several feet across

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
Blew up underneath some houses

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
And kind of destroyed an entire neighborhood

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
Very sad

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
And a lot of trouble

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
When they sort through all that mess

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
But very very sad tragedy

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
So I mean was it scary?

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
Did you have to evacuate?

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
Did you have to get out of the house?

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
What happened?

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
Well it happened

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
The neighborhood affected is maybe two miles away from me

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
Which is very close

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
But when it comes to horrible things happening

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
Is actually a safe amount of distance

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
I actually did not know

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
What was going on

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
Until about 30 minutes later

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
When my roommate knocked on the door and said

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
Hey do you know what's going on outside the window right now?

24:25.000 --> 24:29.000
But I may as well have been in another city

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
This block that I'm on was totally unaffected

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
All of the wind blew all the smoke

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
And everything south

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
Well I'm happy to hear you're okay

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
And that you're out of it fine

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
But I remember last year it was around Christmas

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
Or whatever

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
A very similar thing happened where I was living at the time

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
In a suburb called Rancho Cordova

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
And a house literally blew up

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
Because of a gas leak

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
And I remember distinctly

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
Even though I was about a mile away

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
I heard this giant boom noise

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
And things actually shook for a minute

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
And my car had ash on it

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
It was crazy

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
It was really sad

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
But you didn't hear a giant boom

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
You didn't feel the shake

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
Or was it just oh another earthquake

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
I don't get it. What happened?

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
So only being two miles away

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
And it being as large as it was

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
It did actually shake the building that I'm in

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
Apparently it rattled windows for miles

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
In every direction

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
I was completely oblivious though

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
Because at the time I was raiding

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
In WOW

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
Which is really the punchline

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
That you were trying desperately to get me to

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
So yes, I was raiding in WOW

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
While 53 homes were completely razzed

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
And my housemate had to tell me

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
To look out the window

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
To see what was going on

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
And he had to tell me to look out the window

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
To see all the black smoke

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
Yes, there's the punchline I was looking for

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
And why I brought you on to tell this horrible

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
Tragedy story on the video game radio show

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
Is that you missed

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
Total chaos and tragedy

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
Going on mere miles away

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
Because you were trying to get Fester got down

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
Yeah

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
Everyone's judging me right now

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
Did you get any loot?

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
No

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
I got no good drops

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
But what must have been your reaction though

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
When you opened up the window

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
And just saw all the smoke

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
Were you just like, oh damn

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
Well yeah, I was like

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
That's not good

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
And then I went to KCBS

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
And SF Gate and I started looking at the feeds

26:27.000 --> 26:31.000
Because there was a huge boom

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
That set off the gas explosion

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
And people didn't know what it was

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
So they thought that maybe a plane had crashed

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
Into a house and that set off

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
The gas main, which wasn't the case

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
So I was reading all the speculation on

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
If an airplane went down

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
Which there wasn't, just something sparked

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
And set off the crack in the pipe

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
But yeah, so once

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
I realized what was going on

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
I took time to check it out

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
And after the sunset I could see the orange

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
Glow over the hill

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
Because the fire burned for

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
A couple hours because they couldn't turn

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
The gas main off, so it was like a big blowtorch

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
Oh my gosh, so sad

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
Yeah, I can't even imagine

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
Just being at home, watching Oprah

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
Or being like Dark Sakura, sitting around naked

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
Playing Star Trek online

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
And then suddenly, kaboom

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
Oops

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
PG and E didn't notice the crack in the pipe

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
Uh oh, you know what's actually kind of sad

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
Though, you know, and again

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
I seriously don't mean to make light of a tragedy

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
It's just kind of interesting that

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
Sometimes we get so

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
In the zone of gaming that we miss these things

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
But it's kind of funny, I have a similar story

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
It's not really gaming related, but it was a couple years ago

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
Um, 07 maybe

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
I had just moved into the house

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
I was at, where we had the OLR studio before

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
I don't know if I ever brought this up on the show

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
But the house across the street

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
From us burned down, like it caught fire

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
And burned down one night

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
And I totally missed it going on

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
I was at home, and totally didn't even

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
See it happening, you know why?

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
I was asleep, I was taking a nap

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
After work, and my roommate comes home

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
And is like, Rob, Rob, are you here?

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
Rob, Rob, where's Rob?

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
Practically barking, and I'm like, what's going on?

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
He's like, do you not hear the fire trucks

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
Outside right now?

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
Do you not see the news media?

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
And I kind of do that thing where like

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
I'm kind of groggy and I'm peeking out the window

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
And it's just like, oh shit

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
The house burned down across the street

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
I'm pretty sure it was a meth lab

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
But, you know

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
It's a good thing it didn't spread

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
Thank you fire department

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
When I was in grade school

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
I'm living in Martinez

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
Martinez has a huge

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
Ugly shell oil refinery

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
Behind it, for anyone that's ever been in Martinez

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
It looks very

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
Blade runner

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
It's very gross and huge

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
And that had an explosion

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
And I think like

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
Two or three workers unfortunately died

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
At the time, I was like 10 or 11 years old

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
When this happened

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
And again, the refinery is maybe

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
Four or five miles

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
And you can see the smokestacks of it

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
From out our kitchen window

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
And that actually shook the house

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
And I was very much aware of what was happening then

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
So, yeah

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
And I was probably playing my nest at the time

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
So

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
Yeah, I felt that one

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
But this one, two miles away

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
I was like

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
Wrath, wrath, wrath eclipse

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
Starfire, starfire, starfire

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
I didn't, I don't know

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
Alright, well look

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
We do want to make a donation to the victims of

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
San Bruno, which you know, we don't

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
Again, we don't mean to make fun of it

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
We're making fun of Alan and the fact that he missed it

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
And not making fun of what happened

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
Because it really is a tragedy

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
We do definitely want you to consider

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
Maybe making a donation to the Red Cross

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
To help the victims of the San Bruno fire

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
They can be reached at 1-800-RED-CROSS

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
Simply on the phone

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
And if you specify that you want to donate to the San Bruno fire

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
They will pass those donations along

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
You can also visit them on the web

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
There's also a specific website

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
www.redcrossbayarea.org

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
But Alan would appreciate it

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
If you sent him all your leet purples

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
And wow gold, correct?

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
And for those OLR listeners

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
Living in the Bay Area that have donated blood

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
That don't have ridiculous restrictions

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
Against them, that prevents them from donating blood

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
Which, archaic, archaic things

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
That need to be changed

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
But, you know

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
Unfortunately, we don't want to hold

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
Those silly restrictions against the victims

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
So we'll donate cash I guess

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
But definitely

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
Well thanks for calling

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
Hey, no problem, thanks for being on the show

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
Thank you for letting me make fun of you

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
See, this is why you rock

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
Thank you Alan

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
For letting me make fun of you a little bit on the show

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
I actually don't have a whole lot to add to that

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
My gaming week was kind of uninteresting outside of wow myself

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
If my neighborhood had exploded

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
I would have probably not noticed it either

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
Because I would have been doing the same thing

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
I did check out one new game though

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
The iPhone now has the Game Center

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
Right, just launched this week

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
Now Game Center is available on the iPhone

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
What a pointless thing

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
It doesn't do anything

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
And these are like two half-assed things

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
That Apple has launched lately between PING

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
Which is like, I think it's like Twitter

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
But it's not

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
Because all it really shows is the music

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
Game Room, you just have a friends list

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
And you can see what games they own

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
And what achievements they have

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
But I have yet to see how that whole

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
multiplayer integration works

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
Or anything like that

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
I don't get it

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
I haven't tried any of those

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
But because I'm a sucker and because I had credit

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
Still from gift cards I got for my birthday a few months ago

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
I downloaded one of the Game Center compatible games

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
It's a game called

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
Graal Classic Plus

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
And I was drawn to check out this game

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
Because the artwork kind of makes it look like

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
This little Legend of Zelda-y

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
Chibi type of game

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
And it said it was an MMO

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
I have a neat idea, like an MMO on the iPhone

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
That kind of looks like a Super Nintendo game, right?

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
Awesome? Oh my god

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
It's the worst thing I've ever played in my life

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
It is so stupid

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
Did you spend money on that?

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
Well, I spent someone else's money

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
Because it was gift cards

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
I spent $1.99 on that

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
And it is so stupid

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
It's one of those

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
It's the equivalent of one of those MMOs

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
That you would see the cards for at the grocery store

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
That you just kind of laugh out

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
By those, right?

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
It's worse than Farmville

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
Farmville's pretty awful

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
I don't understand

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
There's no quests

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
There's no leveling

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
It's just make a character and run around

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
Stabbing bushes, hoping you find

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
Little green gems in them

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
I think there's guilds

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
But the chat is all screwed up

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
It's just overcome with idiocy

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
And just people

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
Yelling weird things

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
On the road and trying to trick people

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
Into giving honor points

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
I don't get it

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
Why would anyone waste their time with this garbage

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
Well, I did, I guess

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
Boy, did I pick a stinker to test out Game Center with

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
So now I've decided Game Center is completely stupid

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
And a waste of time

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
Based on this one game that I played

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
So, yeah

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
That would be the one new game

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
That I checked out this week

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
Again, that's Brawl Classic Plus

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
Look, if you want to burn $2

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
It's one of those, I'm almost thinking it's so bad

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
You have to see it

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
If anybody can figure out the point of this game

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
I would love to hear from you

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
I would love to hear from the developers of this game

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
Of what it is they were trying to do with this game

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
Because I don't get it

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
Pull you into paying for it

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
Help

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
So there you go

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
Game Center, fail

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
Ping, fail

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
Brawl, whatever, plus plus, mega fail

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
Otherwise, it's just been more Warcraft

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
Oh, I did play Dead Rising

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
Case Zero myself

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
And it was fun

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
But I got eaten by a lot of zombies

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
Because I'm not very good at Dead Rising

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
Did the military kill you?

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
Did you find all the bike parts easily?

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
No, I was trying to get to the van with the Zombrex

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
And I got chewed up, I didn't get very far at all

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
But I liked that there were so many cut scenes

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
And everything in an arcade game

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
I thought that was kind of cool

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
That was pretty neat, I thought it was fun

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
Pitchfork, rifle, win

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
Alright

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
Let's see, going to

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
You know what, it just occurred to me what a cool weapon would be

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
Take like three broadswords and a pogo stick

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
And you'd have pogo stab

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
That would be awesome

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
Going to our chatroom at chat.orangesolentrader.com

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
Marissa Congusto, we love Marissa

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
I love her

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
Marissa, I love you

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
Alright, I'm going to poop on ping

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
She's pooping, get it?

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
She's going to poop on ping

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
Pooping

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
Because it censors tweets from artists

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
Such as Gaga's pro gay marriage tweets

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
Eye roll, it's useless

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
I didn't even know they did that

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
That would be a great name for a website though

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
Pooping

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
That's great

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
Somebody needs to register that

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
Oh yeah, it's like a copy of Twitter

34:53.000 --> 34:59.000
Can somebody please explain to me the point of ping and game center

34:59.000 --> 35:03.000
And the sad thing is they both sounded really good

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
Just like ping pals? Did that sound good too?

35:05.000 --> 35:09.000
I'm thinking the word ping is just death for your service

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
I remember when ping

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
Coming next week, Orange Ping Radio

35:13.000 --> 35:17.000
Was just, you know, on the other IRC screen where it just went ping, ping, ping

35:17.000 --> 35:21.000
There was also an app for the iPhone for a limited time called ping

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
And it was like free SMS basically, to put it lightly

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
They changed their name a few months ago to ping chat

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
And they never said why, now I know

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
Because Apple probably said

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
You better change your name or we're going to pooping on you

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
So there you go

35:33.000 --> 35:37.000
Maybe we can release an app called pooping

35:37.000 --> 35:43.000
You know what, we should get someone who can program like that and do an app to make fun of it called pooping

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
Or cropping

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
It probably would not get approved by the app store

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
Maybe you could put it on Android

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
Like a social network called pooping

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
And it could be all about

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
Like, you know, because that's what Twitter is for

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
It's all for talking shit about people

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
Well no, you know how you make tweets when you go to the bathroom

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
I'm pooping right now

36:01.000 --> 36:05.000
Or actually, well I noticed that the lovely Jessica Harper is in our chat right now

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
She's from Under Station Live

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
Which is live here at All Games this Saturday night

36:09.000 --> 36:13.000
And I know she uses Foursquare to check in from her toilet

36:13.000 --> 36:16.000
Because she actually has a location called sitting on the toilet

36:16.000 --> 36:19.000
So I could see that being a use of like, pooping

36:19.000 --> 36:22.000
Would be like, you know, sitting on the toilet

36:22.000 --> 36:25.000
Or it could be like, it could be reviews of stalls around the nation

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
I ate lots of fiber today

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
This is really painful

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
Like, you know, Burger King bathroom, well cleaned

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
Smells like bleach

36:37.000 --> 36:41.000
Anyhow, chat.orangelaunchrater.com if you'd like to join

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
And join in the madness

36:43.000 --> 36:47.000
Marissa said that Steve Jobs said himself no more fart apps

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
Really?

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
That's a good thing, I think

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
We don't need any more fart apps

36:53.000 --> 36:57.000
Alright, LightAmiga777 in chat says, OLR poop

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
Where there's smoke, they ping back

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
I think I get that

37:01.000 --> 37:04.000
Alright, let's go ahead and actually get into some gaming news tonight

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
Oh, quick housekeeping

37:06.000 --> 37:09.000
Add us on Facebook, facebook.com slash orangelaunchradio

37:09.000 --> 37:12.000
We also have a Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
And you should add us on those sites

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
And yeah, otherwise

37:16.000 --> 37:19.000
I don't think there's a whole lot of news going on here

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
I'm gonna be out the first week of October

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
October 2nd, 3rd, somewhere in there

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
I'm gonna be gone that week

37:25.000 --> 37:26.000
So I don't know if there'll be a show

37:26.000 --> 37:27.000
Bring me pins

37:27.000 --> 37:28.000
There can be

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
But I'm going to Gay Days at Disneyland

37:30.000 --> 37:31.000
Bring me pins

37:31.000 --> 37:32.000
Lots of them

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
I'm taking Alan for the first time since he was 18

37:34.000 --> 37:35.000
I know

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
Don't worry, we're going back for Tron, remember?

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
December 17th is a big day

37:39.000 --> 37:40.000
Yes, we are, but you still must bring me pins

37:40.000 --> 37:41.000
I will

37:41.000 --> 37:42.000
Maybe they'll have a Tron pin

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
If you find Tron pins, you better

37:44.000 --> 37:45.000
I will

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
I will give you monies

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
For pins, for Tron

37:49.000 --> 37:52.000
Alright, let's get into some actual bonafide gaming news

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
We're only like 40 minutes in this show

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
And haven't talked a lot about gaming news

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
Loki, what's up in the world of gaming?

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
Well, lots of stuff

38:00.000 --> 38:03.000
Especially when it comes to PS3 and firmware

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
And all that fun stuff

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
Well, starting things off

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
You knew what was gonna happen

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
The Playstation 3 got a mandatory firmware

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
Bringing it up to 3.42

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
This firmware update does nothing

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
Other than break the PS

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
Jailbreak and the PS Groove hacks

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
And since this was

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
An overall security

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
Related issue

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
It says we will provide no further

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
Commentary to this case

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
Well, that's a

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
Wonderful thing to say

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
Fucking dick of a Sony rep

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
Well, to be fair

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
Well, why didn't they just say

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
We're not providing commentary

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
In this case, nah

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
They could just say, we don't like people hacking our consoles

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
Devil's advocate

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
A, they don't owe you shit for an explanation

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
B, maybe they plan to litigate against these people

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
So they don't want to say anything publicly

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
Because there's gonna be litigation in the future

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
I don't know if they can, because

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
I don't know, because the

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
Oh, come on, this is America, they can sue anyone

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
They can try, I guess

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
Shrine's important for them

39:07.000 --> 39:11.000
Yay buttons, I don't know

39:11.000 --> 39:15.000
Yaylawsuit.com

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
No new features, though

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
In this latest firmware, right?

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
The only feature is disabling this

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
If you are interested still in running

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
Homebrew stuff, and we will get to why

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
The homebrew is not all bad

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
Remember, it's just that backup device

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
That's the bad thing

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
Homebrew, not so bad

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
Of course, Sony just sees the backup device

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
And that's all they care about

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
So if you don't want to update to 3.41

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
Stay off the PlayStation Network

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
It's interesting, though

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
Because one of the things that actually

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
Did come around because of this

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
Is a way to enable

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
Any PlayStation 3 game

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
To be played as

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
A remote play game

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
On your PSP

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
Why they aren't like that in the first place

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
Is beyond me, but apparently

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
It's a really simple edit to

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
One of the files that's on there

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
That you basically

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
You can actually run this program called

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
A PS3 SFO editor

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
Once you have your game dumped

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
To the hard drive

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
And you just click a button that says

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
PSP Remote Play Available

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
And then click it and it will allow you to play

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
It over your PSP

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
Including games that don't allow it

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
Like, for example, Infamous

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
They actually have video of that

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
That's kind of neat

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
And a feature I don't see why they don't have

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
Maybe because it's buggy

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
In some games, I don't know, but

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
If it can be done

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
I don't know why they don't

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
Well, you kind of answered your own question

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
If it bugs in some games, that's gonna be enough

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
I think

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
It has to work consistently or they're not gonna implement it

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
I would think

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
Well, I don't know about that, but

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
Has it ever stopped developers from

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
Rushing out games?

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
Point taken

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
So, yeah, I don't know

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
And then, let's see

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
Other fun stuff

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
Of course, the PlayStation

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
Freedom

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
It is the port of the

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
PS Groove, I guess

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
It's basically the open source

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
Device or

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
Code that you can throw on

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
A USB stick

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
Well, the PS Freedom

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
Which was the one that's actually being ported

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
To the PSP

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
And everything else

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
Is actually available on quite a few different things

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
Including

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
The iPhone and iPod

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
That is, of course, if you have

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
Your phone or iPod

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
Jailbroken

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
And basically what this does is

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
It runs a modified

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
Program on the

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
Android operating system

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
There's all the different things that do it

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
That way

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
Which is kind of interesting

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
They actually have it ported

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
Funny enough

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
To the TI-84

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
Man, those calculators can do anything

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
Including

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
Wow, they still make those

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
That was the graphing calculator back in my day

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
Yeah

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
Or maybe it was the 82, I don't know, but still

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
Well, they had the 84s back in my day

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
But I think they're a little bit newer now

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
But yeah, they actually

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
You're officially 30 now, you're old

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
I'm sorry to interrupt, I've been told to make a small noise

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
Okay

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
What?

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
You can continue

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
Okay, other devices that the

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
PS Freedom has been ported to

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
The HTC Droid Incredible

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
The HTC Wildfire

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
The HTC Magic 32A

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
The Dream G1

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
Magic 32B

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
These are all HTC Foams

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
The Palm Pre

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
The Dingu

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
I actually have a Dingu

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
I haven't gotten a chance to do it yet

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
But I may try that

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
The Sony Ericsson Xperia X1

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
The Nokia N900

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
Or N800 or N810

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
The Droid

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
The Droid

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
Aris

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
Of course, the original

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
Oh, and the Palm Pre

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
Yeah, so basically

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
Everything

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
And if it's not out for your device

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
It will probably be ported to it

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
You know

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
I guess it's not such a bad thing if

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
You know, you're really interested

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
In actually putting this

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
You know, exploit on your console

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
It should be readily available

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
To do so

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
And if it's not for stuff that you may have

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
At home right now, it will be probably soon

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
I'm sure, you know

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
A piece of French toast will eventually be able to be

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
Used in hacking your

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
PS3, so

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
Just have to give it some time

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
I did forget to mention

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
Earlier in the show that because

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
You know, you're now officially 30, right Loki?

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
Yes I am

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
So now it's officially the gaming show for

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
30-somethings is Orange Lounge

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
Radio, that's right

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
The old crotchety video gaming show

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
We actually have a new theme song

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
For the new Orange Lounge Radio, we're gonna be debuting

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
Do we? Yeah, we should have done it tonight

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
But we'll do it next week

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
Since we're so old, here's our new theme song you guys

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
Thank you for being a friend

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
That old

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
Rob your dork

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
Back in my day

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
Oregon and

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
Trail was in green, and only green

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
And we liked it

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
Hey

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
On the DSI

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
There's a new firmware update as well

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
The 1.4.1U

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
It's a new update on the DSI firmware

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
Guess what it does?

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
Ah yes, it blocks piracy

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
And certain flash carts and all that stuff

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
Try to block piracy

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
Copying games is bad

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
I get that, but these types of things also block out

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
The homebrew, which is the really fun stuff

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
So anyway the new firmware update

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
On the DSI, it's the first update they've done

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
In about a year, no new functionality

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
It just does quote

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
Behind the scenes improvements to system

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
Performance, which means

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
Some of the flash cartridges that allowed

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
The lead hack source, no longer work

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
Some of the affected carts are

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
The ace card 2i, the super card

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
The DS2, the M3i0

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
The iPlayer, and the DSTTI

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
I didn't even know all these things existed

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
Did you know about the existence of

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
All these carts? I've never heard of half of these

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
Yeah

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
There's a lot of them out there, most people just

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
Know the R4

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
Some carts did manage to

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
Escape the patch

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
The iSmart DS, the EZ Flash

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
And the Hyper R4

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
Ah yes, the R4

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
So there you go

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
It's possible

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
That they will have like you know

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
Firmware updates to the actual cards themselves

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
That may re-enable them

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
It's a back and forth game

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
You know

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
I get it, I mean they

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
Have, they owe it to their developers

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
And they owe it to themselves to try and

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
Stop piracy

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
But it does kind of stink that there isn't at least

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
Some type of open channel for homebrew

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
I mean I feel like the only group

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
Whatsoever that has somewhat

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
Embraced homebrew

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
Granted in an ultimately controlled environment

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
Is Microsoft and the indie games

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
But even then that's really controlled

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
Or even Apple with their app store

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
Yeah even though apps have to go through

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
Scores and scores of approvals

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
But you know what? There's fart apps galore

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
And all this stupid shit

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
Can you imagine if these people were able to

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
Program apps for like say

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
The Nintendo DSi

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
I mean it may be a little bit more difficult

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
But

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
It would be really interesting

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
I'm surprised Nintendo's DSi doesn't try to

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
Cash in on the app craze

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
And I thought it was to some extent

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
They have the DSi store and so forth

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
They're so behind though

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
Open it up to let people make their own things

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
Make them charge 99 cents for it

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
And take half

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
Well how long did it take them to finally come out with WiiWare

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
I mean seriously

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
They're so behind

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
So I'm not surprised

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
But yeah

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
I'm bummed for the homebrew

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
It's a little harder to feel sympathy

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
For pirates

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
The jig is up kids

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
But for homebrew you're kinda like oh

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
Bummer

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
There's also another update to the Wii

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
System firmware as well

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
It's actually still marked as the current firmware

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
But it will remove all the

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
Homebrew that you have installed on your system

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
So

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
But does the exploit still work?

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
Or did they patch that too?

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
It goes in and takes out all the homebrew

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
They keep patching it and they keep finding ways

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
Around it so

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
Yes and no I don't know at this point

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
Interesting

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
It's not done with Legend of Zelda anymore

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
They can do it easier so

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
Well we'll see what firmware is released on a system

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
Next week that takes something away

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
Without adding anything

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
Dark Sakura in the meantime

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
What do you got for us in Other Worlds of Gaming?

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
We're actually having a discussion about food in the chatroom

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
What kind of food? Jewish food

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
Rollie pollie fish heads from Jessica Harper

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
That's not food I don't eat fish heads

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
Although I did eat something very unique

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
I had herring in sour cream

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
Was it good?

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
Yeah it actually was

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
But it was

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
Very interesting because they expected me to not like it

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
Or to make a face at it and I was like

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
This is pretty good I haven't

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
Eaten a whole lot of interesting food lately

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
We eat squirrel in Alabama Although

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
Alan cooked last night

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
It was really good

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
He did the chicken and his own little breadcrumb thing

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
It was really cute

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
I know

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
Now read the story

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
Read the damn story

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
That's so cute and gay

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
Well

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
For LittleBigPlanet 2

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
There is good news

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
That is if you played a lot of LittleBigPlanet

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
The first

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
And that is

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
The beta invites

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
Are going out but it's just for people

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
Who are super active in LittleBigPlanet

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
So I guess that they're

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
Checking

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
People who create upload

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
Who play regularly

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
So here's the major points

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
And also

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
They're not actually out recruiting

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
Beta testers

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
They're just sending the invites to people who play the game a lot

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
But some of those points are

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
You have to be 18 years or older

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
And be a resident

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
In a country which we operate

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
If you're reading the direct thing

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
Operate the Playstation store

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
The beta will be in English

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
So you have to provide feedback in English

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
And the beta test community

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
And the existing LittleBigPlanet

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
Beta testers will automatically

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
Be included in the beta trial

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
And it says

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
Please note that being selected for this beta

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
Does not give you access to other beta

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
Trials we may operate

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
The last thing is that participation

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
In the beta trials is subject to their beta

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
Trial agreement

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
Which I pretty much think means

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
Don't go spilling

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
All this crap to other people

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
Which is going to happen

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
I think that's a good way to do it

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
Because then they'll be

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
Giving it to people who understand the mechanics of the game

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
The more that you play something

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
Clearly the more you understand it

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
What Rob?

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
You looked funny

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
No I'm reading chat and having fun with them

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
But as far as

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
The way they're doing the beta invites

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
It makes sense, it's cute

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
It's a good way to do it

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
I didn't really get that much into LittleBigPlanet

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
I know I'm not getting invited

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
But why not

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
Get your hardcore community in there

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
Because they're the ones that are

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
A. Gonna most be shocked by the changes

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
And B. Probably test it the most

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
It makes sense

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
I'm surprised they don't do the same thing with World of Warcraft

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
Well maybe that is how they send out the invites

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
There's other ways you can get one

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
I got one, I probably shouldn't have it

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
But I do

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
Touch you

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
I actually haven't played it a whole lot

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
A lot is still borked in the World of Warcraft beta

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
What I really want in right now

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
Is the DC Universe beta

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
That's what I really want to play right now

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
You're not going to play Star Trek Online

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
You need to give that card to someone who will

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
I'll give it back if you really want it

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
I'll check it out someday

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
You have to play with me

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
In ten days

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
We'll go kill some Borg and smack some Klingons around

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
It'll be fun

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
Good times

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
There's got to be at least one other OLR listener that plays Star Trek Online

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
We'll have to hunt down Travis

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
Does he?

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
I would play just to attack his ship in the middle of the night

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
You'd have to play a Klingon

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
Rob!

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
I think you'd have to play a Klingon

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
Really?

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
And that means you'd actually have to level up a character

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
To I think Lieutenant Commander

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
The half Klingon, half human

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
You can sort of make one

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
You get this selection

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
I don't know how we got from Little Big Planet

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
Oh, we just broke the show with too much nerdiness

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
Oh, that's too bad

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
You get an option to choose

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
Alien

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
And then you can customize them however you want them to look

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
I see

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
Alright, let's move on Loki

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
Well, digital distribution seems to be

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
Catching on everywhere else

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
So why not the arcade?

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
I'm just going to at least try it

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
And they've introduced a new digital distribution system

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
Called Nesica X Live

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
And this was being shown off

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
At the 48th amusement machine show

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
In Chiba

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
And apparently

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
It will allow arcade operators

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
To purchase cabinets

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
And then download games to the cabinets

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
Including a bunch of older titles

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
As well as brand new releases

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
They said that 9 arcade game makers

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
Are supporting the platform

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
Including SNK

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
And CAVE

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
And the first title release for the system

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
Will be none other than Taito's

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
BlazBlue Continuum Shift 2

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
And

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
That's kind of interesting

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
I don't know if they'll ever make it out over here like that

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
I don't see why not

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
I don't know

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
It kind of makes me wonder though

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
I assume this is going to be very similar to

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
How they have the CPS2

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
And 3 systems and stuff like that

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
Where it's just a cartridge based

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
System but instead of a cartridge

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
It's going to be a hard drive with

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
A programmer

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
Or I guess actually the new Taito system

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
Is actually run off of a Windows XP system

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
I just have a feeling

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
These will be easily dumped

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
And stolen because

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
Well no seriously if you think about it

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
Because it's going to have

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
The same front end

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
That's going to be running all these games

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
And all you're going to be doing is exchanging out

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
The actual

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
Game data

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
So if you

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
Put out that

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
Program

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
Then people are going to be able to

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
Just dump the game data and all these

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
Arcade games will leak

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
Despite all this back alley stuff that you're talking about

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
When it comes to this system

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
What do you think of this system as a way to possibly

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
Revitalize arcades? I think it's a neat idea

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
It's kind of like taking something from the home

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
Consoles that's working well and putting it in arcades

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
Haven't we seen this happen to some extent already

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
Like a little bit

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
Like I know some of the later Bamani games do this

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
With the whole emusment and so forth

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
And I think Technica does the same thing

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
And I even think some of the fighting games are doing this now

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
With some type of digital delivery right?

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
I think it's a good idea in the sense that it will

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
Save arcade operators at least

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
If they were to implement this in the states

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
A whole lot of

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
Shipping costs because shipping

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
Arcade games is not cheap

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
At all and

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
Is that first hand?

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
Yes somewhat

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
I know that too because I priced

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
Trying to get a baby pacman machine

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
Because that's how bad I wanted one

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
And honestly the machine itself I could afford

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
It was the shipping that was going to kill me

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
To get one of those machines

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
That's how bad I want that stupid machine

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
A baby pacman?

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
I know

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
I'll track one down for you

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
Finding one locally maybe

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
That would be cool

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
Shipping is expensive

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
So um

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
I mean granted that they wouldn't be shipping

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
A new cabinet each time

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
They would just be doing a cartridge

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
Or something like that

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
If it were any other system

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
But even still

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
That's one less expense

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
They have to deal with

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
Although then they have to have internet

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
So maybe it evens itself out

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
But at least when a game is released

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
They can have it there relatively quick

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
Because you know if you were overnight

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
A cabinet from you know

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
Japan or something like that

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
That would cost millions of dollars

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
That boat would have to go very fast

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
To get the machine over here

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
Speed boat

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
You'd have to get Johnny Quest

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
To get that machine out here that fast

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
Alright

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
Well I think it's a really interesting

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
Idea and I could see arcades going that way

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
But is it going to be enough to save them?

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
I don't know

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
No one gives a crap how the games get to the arcade

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
It's just what games are at the arcade

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
What do you think they could do

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
And we have this conversation once in a while

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
On the show and I'll open this up to the chat too

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
What do you think they could do to an arcade

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
To make people come back?

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
Give them something that they can't get at home

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
With consoles

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
That's really it

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
Right now it's very difficult

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
To come up with that kind of stuff

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
Because

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
Lately it's community

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
For the past ten years or so

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
It's the DDR community obviously

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
What this show owes its roots to

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
Or fighting game communities

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
You can't readily get that stuff at home

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
You can buy some homemade

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
Or really expensive dance pads

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
And stuff

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
But it's still not the same as the arcade

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
But now

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
With Guitar Hero and stuff

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
Guitar Freaks is kind of

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
A done deal

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
And the Guitar Hero arcade game

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
Is just dumb

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
S2-100 Matt in chat says free blowjobs

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
Insert quarter, insert wiener

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
That's not an arcade game

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
Okay, that's a peep show

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
Free spankings

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
Or like an Asian massage parlor

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
That is not an arcade

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
Now they put an arcade in

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
Was that during the part of the marathon

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
You were here for?

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
I don't think I was here for any part of the marathon

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
I don't remember if it was in the first three hours

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
I think that you were gone

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
But Rob played this funny YouTube video

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
It was Allen

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
The happy ending

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
I'll find it, keep talking

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
Get ready to wreck

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
So

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
I don't know if there's a lot they can do to revitalize

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
It's just basically bringing out games that are

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
Going to be

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
Able to do stuff that you can't

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
Really do at home

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
You know the big old gun games

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
Just giving people a reason to come to the arcade

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
Kind of

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
This is from Mediocre Films on YouTube

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
They get full credit for this

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
Mediocre Films is the name of the YouTube here

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
This is called

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
Happy ending

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
Here you go, Loki

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
Link it in the chatroom too

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
You like?

58:11.000 --> 58:21.000
Ohh

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
She's sitting on his butt

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
I love the generic Asian restaurant music

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
They play in the background

58:27.000 --> 58:43.000
Don't overplay

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
She just took her dress off

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
You liking this, Loki?

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
Good movie, huh?

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
His head is totally not laying on that right

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
You're not supposed to lay on the little

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
Happy ending

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
Okay

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
Okay

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
Happy ending

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
There's like clowns and a juggler

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
And puppets

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
And balloons

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
This is what they need at arcades

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
And they all leave

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
She's clapping

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
Are you happy now?

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
It wasn't what I was hoping for

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
Oh no

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
Maybe you want a hand jive

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
$50

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
For a

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
Hand jive, right?

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
Yeah, hand jive

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
Yeah, okay

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
Okay

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
Hand jive

59:43.000 --> 59:47.000
Hand jive, hand jive, hand jive, hand jive, hand jive

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
Get into hand jive

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
Hand jive, hand jive, hand jive, hand jive

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
Like grease

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
See, wasn't that worth derailing the entire show to watch?

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Yes it was

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
Wasn't that awesome radio making the listeners

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
Listen to a movie?

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
It's hilarious

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Please show that to Nelly when you get home

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
I will

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
Tell her we send it with love

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
Speaking of things that don't make sense

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
Just like us playing a video

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
On a radio show

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
The PSP Go

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
Did you like that segue?

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
That was an excellent segue

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
Kazurai, the PS boss

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
Of course

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
This week has admitted

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
In an interview with

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
MCVUK.com

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
That the $250

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
Pricing could perhaps

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
Have been the problem

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
Behind the sale

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
Matter of fact it was a poor design

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
In the first place

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
Let me give you the quote here

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
Which Darkcoagackenchat calls the PSP No

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
Quote

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
I think we need to make sure we have as many titles

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
Available to download as possible

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
To make the experience as easy as possible

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
But also pricing

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
Is perhaps an issue

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
Because of the cost reductions

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
We've been able to do over the years

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
The traditional PSP has benefited

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
But the PSP Go is a completely different design

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
So the cost trend is different

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
So

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
There you go

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
No I don't

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:27.000
Was maybe pricing the problem with the PSP Go

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
You think possibly

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
Perhaps that you put out a skew with

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
Less features

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
And then

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
I don't know, offered it for a more

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
Expensive price

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
And then I don't know

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
Just utterly stopped supporting it

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
Because you know you haven't really

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Released any sort of bundles

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Oh that's because you can't bundle anything with it

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
Because it doesn't have a UMD drive

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
To play the games that would be bundled with it

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
Ah fun

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
You could give a card for a free download

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
Yeah everybody likes cards

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
Dungeon buster in our chat room says

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
Thank you for giving me work to do

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
And I have to go online and download the title

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Dungeon buster in our chat room

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
At chat.orangeslawnsherd.com says

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
I love how Sony spins failure

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
That was a good spin of failure don't you think

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
Perhaps, perhaps

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
Just maybe

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
It was possibly the fact

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
That the pricing

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
Is what ruined it

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
Perhaps

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
I'm not sure

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
We have some analysts we're paying money to look into right now

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
But perhaps

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
Let me tell you for free

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
Yes that was the issue

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
It was definitely the pricing

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
Was the issue

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
The pricing for flimsy piece of crap

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:45.000
I saw a PSP go in one of those fancy vending machines the other day

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
It kind of made me laugh a little bit

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:51.000
Well there was somebody in one of my history classes that had it for class

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
And I said okay you gotta let me see that

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
So I tried playing a little bit

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
That mic is not your friend right now

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
What? I'm holding it together

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
I'm just saying it's cutting in and out

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
I don't write the rules of electronics

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
I just tell you what it is

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
Rob

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
Rob

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
Yes person in your electronics class

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
At any rate

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
I got to play one because a guy in my

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
One of my history classes

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
Was playing one and I said you gotta let me

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
Try it and I was like yeah

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Piece of crap

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
I'm sorry you're not going to appreciate this but I know we're talking about

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
The PSP go right now and it really smells like

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
Shermie took a caca like is it just me

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
That smells that

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
She went go

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
I want to see if she really did take

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
She did

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Shermie does not like the

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
PSP go

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
Your cat has

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
Impeccable comic timing

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
I just want to say

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
I don't think dark soccer appreciates that

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
Shermie

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
Bad kitty

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
I don't think we're allowed to talk about the PSP go anymore

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
Shermie

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
has therefore ended the conversation by

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
Taking a dump

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
In the middle of the floor

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
It stinks that dark soccer

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
Has the next story so we'll just

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
We'll just sit here and think about that for a moment

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Hi

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
Poopy butt

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
Okay and you want to know

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
I have to say this

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
For the amount of stink that comes out of that cat's ass

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
Her poop

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
Her little poop

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
Was about the size of an Ikea meatball

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
Thank you for that comparison

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
Sweetest meatballs will never be the same

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
That means that she couldn't even give

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
A full sized cat crap

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
About the PSP go

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
I love my cat

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
And she's sitting under the pinball table like

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
I did it

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
Her little sassy fat butt

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
So need for speed MMO

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
Have you played it?

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
I haven't

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
He actually really likes it but you can only get up to level 10

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
Before you have to actually pay for it

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
But not anymore

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
Because need for speed world

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
Once it hit 1 million registered users

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
It actually is now free to play

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
No more charge

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
But

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
You still have to buy boosts

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
And double XP bonuses and that type of thing

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
So

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
I hate the word

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
The combination microtransaction

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
I just think it's stupid

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
A transaction

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Is a transaction

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
I'm just saying all those media sites use it

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
It's just kind of one of those things

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
And they're all stupid

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
A transaction is a transaction

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
Oh and it's like the gods above

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Just pulled the cord on your mic

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
Ugh

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
Sony dislikes your comments about their transaction

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
A transaction is a transaction

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
They should just call it

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
Payment

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
You have to pay for this stuff

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
Money is money

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
A little money is still money

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
Damn you people

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
So is the game fun? I'm interested in it

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
Dan likes it

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
And he likes doing the

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
Getting the bonuses where you run through

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
Police barriers and that type of thing

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
You know

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
It gives you points for

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
How many cops get injured I guess

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Which is kind of wrong

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
But you know

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
It's actually pretty cool

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
I think they have just a couple of

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Cars that you can pick from right now

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
At least at the level that he's at

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
But it's like playing Need for Speed on the system

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
Except you just

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
Truck all over the town on your computer

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
He likes it

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
He says that he would rather play it with a wheel

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
Than use the

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
Keyboard like he's been doing

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
The keys gotta stink

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
Maybe a 360 controller would work better though

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
Maybe a little better than the keys

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
Zebun Artarum says you guys gotta get a new mic

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
I think, I hope it's not the mic

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
That's the newest mic in the studio

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
It's probably the cord, not the mic

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
Something maybe happened where the mic fell

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Or something and shorted

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
One of the wires, I don't know

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
It slides out just a little bit

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
I think that I just need to get a new mic cable

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
Yeah, hopefully that's it

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
Or we could take the mic cable from a working mic

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
That might be the solution

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
That one's not detachable

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
Yeah it is, at the bottom

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
Maybe we could try that during the break and see if that works

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
I can hold it

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
I can hold it, I'm a big girl

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
Let's travel around the world

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
And look at some release dates

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
And what's coming to a console near you

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
We'll start in the USA

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
Loki?

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
Well, there's some things

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
Coming out this week

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
I'm sure there's something big

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
I just can't remember what it was called

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
Oh yeah, Halo Reach

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
That's right, that's out this week on

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
The Xbox 360

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
Well here's everything else

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
That doesn't really matter

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
Professor Layton and the Unwound Future comes out today

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
That's on the DS

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
Dawn of Heroes coming out

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
On the DS as well this week

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
Deal or No Deal Special Edition

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
What's special about it?

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
Well they updated some of the games so it's more like the TV show is now

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
Other than that it's not that special

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
That will be out on the Wii this week as well

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Deer Drive on the Nintendo DS

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
Now you can hunt deer on your DS

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
That's exciting I guess

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
Damn deer

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
Damn you deer

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
Painkiller Pandemonium

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
On PC out this week

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
Fancy Nancy

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
Is that like Rush Limbaugh

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
And other you know

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
Pill addicted celebrities

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
Doom clone

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
Fancy Nancy Tea Party Time

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
On the DS

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
Really? Really

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Can you say that one more time?

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
Fancy Nancy Tea Party Time

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
Fancy Nancy Tea Party Time

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
What the hell do you do in Fancy Nancy Tea Party Time

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
Well I'm glad you asked

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
Well let's see

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
Fancy Nancy Tea Party Time

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
Is so awesome that it doesn't deserve

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
Either a high res box shot

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
Or a synopsis

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
But if I want to remember I believe that you have to

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
Oh they're about books

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
Hold on there's a trailer here

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
Let's see Fancy Nancy Tea Party Time

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
Let's look here at a trailer

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
Again watching Netflix

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
With the radio listeners

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
Always a good time

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
Let's see here

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
She is pretty Nancy

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
In five short years

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
Fancy Nancy has enchanted the hearts

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
And wardrobes of girls all over the world

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
With over 25 books

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
And more than 10 million copies sold

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
Nancy adorned the New York Times

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
Best seller list for over 200 weeks

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
So far no mention of a video game

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
Just saying

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
I wouldn't let my girl read that

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
And the party is just getting started

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
Would you let your girl read Twilight?

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
Hell no

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
Do you enjoy being glamorous

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
Extravagant

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
And posh

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
But she could be glamorous, extravagant

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
And posh

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
I would rather her be intelligent

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
Confident

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
And not having to conform to anything like that

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
This gash is for you

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Fancy Nancy Tea Party Time

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
For the first time ever

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000

Choose her time

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
Hold on wait I'm trying to look at some of the dialogue there

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
Hurray I found a tea set

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
I bet it's terrific

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
Well if you're going to throw a tea party

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
You're fired

A plethora of puzzles

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
This trailer goes on way too long

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
Wait she's the big word

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000

We should send out an invite on Facebook

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000

Yeah so that's on DS

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
Gamer girl in chat says

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
The tea is laced with marijuana

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
Now that's a game I'd play

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
Maui Wowie's Tea Party

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
Frisbee says Fancy Nancy

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
In the meth lab

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
If you feel like killing something

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
After hearing that trailer

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
PSP maybe the DS

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
I don't know

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
It's out on a lot of systems

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
You hunt stuff, everybody loves it

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000

Spooky Swamp out on the Wii

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
And the DS

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
And I believe the PSP

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
Maybe the Playstation 2

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
Who cares, it sucks

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
Frisbee's suggesting Fancy Nancy in the meth lab

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
That's what I said

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
That's what she's really gathering the supplies for

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
I thought you said Dark Tattoo, sorry

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
Truth or Lies

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
It's a game

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
On the PS3, Xbox 360

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
And the Wii

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
You

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
Are challenged to

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
Lie to your friends I guess

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
I don't really know what the hell the point of this is

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
Bring the party into your living room

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
Inspire hilarious discussions and learn about your friends

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
As deep dark

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
Secrets are revealed

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
It's time to uncover who is telling the truth

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
And who is flat out lying

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
I'm guessing that it has some sort of way to tell

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
If you're a liar or not

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
Maybe, otherwise this game is lame

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:57.000
AkumaJP suggests Fancy Nancy's happy ending

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
Fancy Nancy's hand job

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
Or Fancy Hand Job I guess

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
Legends of the Guardian

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000

Playstation 3, Xbox 360

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
Wii and DS this week

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
That tie in with the brand new animated movie

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
Finish in Ferb

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
Right again on the DS

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
If you like that cartoon series I guess

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
Dark Sacros is like yelling for the other room

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
What?

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
I freaking love Phineas and Ferb

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
That show is crack

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
I would play a game

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
And she has

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
Sipped the

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
Disney Kool-Aid

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
Racket Sports coming out on

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
Playstation 3 this week

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
This is very similar to the game

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
That was out on the Wii

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
It's like Wii Sports

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
Lord of the Rings

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
Aragorn's quest on the

The Wii, the DS and the

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
PSP, of course the PS3 version

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
Works with the Playstation Move

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
And is equally lame

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
Gladiator begins

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
Not a prequel to the

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
Gladiator movie but it is

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
A gladiator combat game

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
There are a lot of games I don't care about

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
Coming out this week

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
Me too and I'm covering all of them

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
Alpha and Omega

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
Alpha and Omega, it's a DS game

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
Whatever, and Jesus

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
US release has been going on for like an hour

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
Halo Reach comes out this week

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
There are a lot of mature

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
Chatters, chat room

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000

Has come out against Cabela's

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
Maybe this year Cabela's will take it

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
Oh

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
Anyways

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
Oh and Cabela's

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
Did have a version with a gun for the Wii

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
Alright I'm almost done

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000

Nature coming from Konami on the Wii and

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
The DS, I don't even know what that is nor do I care

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
Yu-Gi-Oh

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
50's dual

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
Transfer on the Wii

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000

Legendary and Limited Editions as well

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
A game called Swords on the Wii

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
Wonder what you do in that

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
That's a

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
That's a tough one there

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
Let me give you the results

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
Of our quick poll

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
Fancy Nancy or Halo Reach, you ready?

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
Fancy Nancy Milthouse

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
Fancy Nancy goes to the strip club

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
Halo Reach, Fancy Nancy, Reach

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
Fancy Nancy, Reach, this is sad

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
It's split 50-50

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
Fancy Halo Reach, Fancy Nancy

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
Reach around, I'd much rather have

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
Fancy Nancy, Reach

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
Fancy Nancy download content for

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
Halo Reach, I almost said Hello Reach

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
Fancy Nancy, Reach

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
Fancy Nancy's pap smear

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
Fancy Nancy please

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
More like Halo Reach around

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
Etc, etc, it's half and half

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
I don't know what to think about that

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
Well

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
I don't know, and two last things

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
The Fantasy Star Portable on the PSP

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
And finally, it's not really a game

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
But it's coming out this week, the PlayStation Move

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
And all the wonderful components for that

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
And

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
A goddamn thing on this website

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
Says that, you know

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
There's stupid

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
Sports champions

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
Or whatever game

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
Is out, despite the douchebag

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
And the GameStop saying

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
Well it doesn't come out until the 17th

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
Yeah the bundle doesn't come out until the 17th

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
You idiot

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
Are you done? Are you finished?

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
Are you finished? Are you sure?

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
Hey, going to Japan

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
And looking at what's coming out, the Japanese release dates

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
Yay

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
Halo Reach also comes out in Japan this week

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
On September the 15th, front mission evolved

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
September the 16th

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
In Japan, those are both on, of course on the Xbox 360

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
Moving on over to the

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
PlayStation 3

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
See I don't know, is

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
Halo Reach as big of a deal overseas as it is here

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
I would think

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
It's still like

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
It's like a B game

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
It's up there but not like way up there

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
PlayStation 3, front mission evolved

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
Is there as well

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
As well as Mobile Suit Gundam Senkai

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
Record UC 0081

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
That's just a price reduction though

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
That game's actually already been out

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
Moving over to the Nintendo Wii and seeing what

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
Glorious games they're getting over there in Japan

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
Let's see

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
Deca Sports 3 is this week

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
Wii to Sports 10

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
Shimoku comes out this week in the pretty popular

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
Deca Sports series, that series does pretty well for Hudson

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
Doesn't it?

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
It's like Wii Sports never dies

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
Nothing really notable on the PlayStation 2

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
But I do have the Nintendo DS

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
Jinsai Game QDS

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
Heisei no Dekigoto

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
That is also a price reduction that's moving into the best

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
Otherwise not a lot of new games this week

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
Although on the 18th, there's all these

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
Like new covers coming out

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
If you want to get covers for your

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
DSI in different colors, you have that to look forward to

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
Ooh, this ought to be good though

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
On the Sony PSP, here's a big week

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's Tag Force 5

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
Cause I know there's some Closet Yu-Gi-Oh! fans out there

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:11.000
Dissida Final Fantasy Universal Tuning is ultimate hits

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
So Square sometimes does this with their games

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
They put out kind of like an international version later on

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
I'm assuming it's kind of this version of this

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
Also a game called Blue Roses

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:27.000
Yosai to Aoi Hitomi no Senshi Tashi comes out this week

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
Oh, I think that's uh, hold on

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
It's Blue Roses

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
It's a strategy game

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
I was looking at the title

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
Oh sorry, it's an RPG pretty much

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:41.000
This game's from Nippon Ichi Entertainment

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
Who makes a lot of the games

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
Just looks like your typical Japanese RPG honestly

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
With your little anime cutscenes

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
It looks cute, looks cute

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
I'm sure there'll be some people that want to import that

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
That's it for Japanese releases

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
How about The Old Kingdom?

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
Oh, we have a number of things over there

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
Taylor Reach, and then Legend of the Guardians

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
The Owls of Gahool

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
Oh, that's not from that book

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
That was that movie, right?

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
A book and a movie, yeah

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
There's Scooby-Doo and the Spooky Swamp

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
Final Fantasy Tactics

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
The War of the Lions on iPhone

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
Sounds fun

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
Flight Control, Kung Fu Rider

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
and PlayStation Move on the 15th

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
As well as also on the 15th

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
Sonic Adventure for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
And Sports Champions

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
And Start the Party

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
And closing up the week

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
On the 17th we have Lionheart

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
King's Crusade on PC

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
R.U.S.E

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
And Two Worlds 2

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
Of course, there's a game coming out next week

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
That totally makes me laugh by the name Deathspank

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
That's funny

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
Nice

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
Quick question from your chatroom

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
Spyro's asking, what about Final Fantasy 14?

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:53.000
I believe it's out in two weeks on the PC

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
At the end of the month

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
Yeah, and my list for Japanese releases doesn't cover the PC

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
So I'm not sure when it's coming out of there

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
PlayStation 3 is not until next year

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
And I think that's the same

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
Be it Japan or the U.S.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
I think PC is getting the first crack at that

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
And Collector's Edition is what, the 22nd?

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
I think regular people get in on the 30th

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:15.000
I'm a little skeptical about Final Fantasy 14

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
I don't know, I'm weird though

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
I feel like I need to buy it

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:23.000
I need to give the retail game a good old fashioned college try

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
I need to try it

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
And see what I really think of it

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:31.000
But then again, I'm like, oh wow, but that beta was so bad

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
But I don't know

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
I'm really torn, that's where I'm at

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
We'll see, to be continued

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:41.000
It really depends, probably like, do I have money to spend on Final Fantasy 14 or not

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
That's really what it's going to come down to, probably

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:47.000
Alright, let's move on with some other news

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
We're going to talk to Game of the Week here in just a little bit

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
Here on the show, Loki

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
Ah yes, so

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
It's kind of interesting

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
For the longest time I remember

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
Apple was so

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
Adamant about not

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
Supporting Flash in

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
Their applications, well

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
That may change soon actually

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
They're going to relax some of the

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
IOS

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
Development restrictions

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
Including the

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
Use now of third party

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
Tools like Flash CS5

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
So apparently

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
New apps now can be developed with that in mind

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
That's kind of cool

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
So maybe

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
I don't know, we'll get some more apps that way

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
Maybe a better web browser

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
Does that mean it's easier to make apps now

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
Because people have been asking for an

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
OLR app for forever

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
I'm kind of like, I don't know

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
Flash I guess

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
I don't know what to put in an OLR app

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
Did it ever get put back in the store though?

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
I heard that it was gone from the store

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
For a little while, I don't know if it ever came back

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
I don't know. What else would be on an OLR app

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
That's not already on the all games app

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
I don't know. I can think of a few things

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
I know one of the other shows I've seen

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
Out there does like special shows

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
That you get if you buy the app

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
But I don't know

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
I don't know how I feel about that. We're too lazy for that

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
Yeah, and it's always kind of been like, you know, we've always put

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
Everything out there for free, I would feel bad to suddenly

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
Make, like if we're going to make people pay for things

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
We need to get those stupid shirts done

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
Or something like, you know, something really really extra

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
Beyond audio and video content

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
Which we've always done for free, you know

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
Not dogging on other shows

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
I, you know, everybody's got to

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
Pay the bills somehow, it's just, you know

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
We've never really made money off this show

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
And I don't think we're ever going to

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
And that's fine. It is what it is

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
Darktide Studio suggesting an

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
OLR and a USL combined soundboard

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
Now, okay, now that

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
I could, that's something a little extra

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
Perhaps, perhaps, we'll see

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
Alright, moving on

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
Let's see, oh, I like this

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
Oh, and Tigerclaw confirms the All Games app

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
Is still not back on the App Store

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
Well, maybe we need to put an app up there

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
Just so that there's something to tune into the radio show

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
On the go, I don't know, although I think Video Game

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
Outsiders have one

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
And that show's plenty fine, I like what they do over there

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
Mario

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
It's a hacky Mario game

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
Not really, more like a homebrew Mario game

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
It's created by Ben Weber

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
He's a candidate for his PhD in computer science

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
He goes to UC Santa Cruz

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
He's programmed a game

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
And it uses sprites from Super Mario World

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
So you could say it's homebrew

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
But what this game does is it's called

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
Infinite Adaptive Mario

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
And the level starts with

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
Moderate difficulty

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
But once you beat that, the next level gets harder

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
And gets harder and harder

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
Until you die three times in a row

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
Without completing a level

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
When it gets easier

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
And by the way, harder means yes, it gets

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
A lot harder

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
According to Weber, Infinite Adaptive Mario

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
Scales up difficulty by increasing

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
The frequency of gaps

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
Average size of gaps, variation of ground height

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
And a number of enemies

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
So in other words, as you get

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
Smarter, so does the game

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
And in some cases

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
If you look at some of these screenshots

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
There's like 16 monsters on the screen at once

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
Including piranha plants

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
That just fly in mid-air

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
That seems really hard

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
That looks crazy, I was looking at it

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
The author put Infinite Adaptive Mario

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
Up against an AI program

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
That completes randomly generated Mario levels

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
And there's this whole YouTube

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
On how that goes

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
That sounds kind of interesting actually

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
You can download it on

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
The website for UC Santa Cruz

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
But it is a little bit buggy

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
But that's kind of interesting

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
Although, I kind of think

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
Hasn't Nintendo gone that direction

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
A little bit, like games don't get

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
Harder necessarily, but didn't they put in

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
That controversial quote unquote system

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
A little while back where the levels get

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
Easier, or I guess the tutorials

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
Luigi tutorials come up if you're

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
Screwing up, like wasn't that in the Mario

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
Versus game, the new Super Mario Brothers

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
Wii, if you die like 8 times

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
In a level then you get the Luigi tutorial

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
Kind of interesting huh?

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
That's the, you suck

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
So we're going to teach you not to suck

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
Exactly

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
Uh, Loki you're playing that right now

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
I see you, I see you over there

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
You're playing it right now aren't you

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
I think he is, I was going to yeah

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
Except they don't tell you what the buttons are

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
Which makes it difficult, oh that might be kind of difficult

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
Alright hey uh

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
Let's get to the classic

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
Game of the week, it's a segment here on the show

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
Where we take a trip down memory lane

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
With the help of Dark Sakura and her gaming vault

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
To say hey

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
Here's a video game you little brats

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
Should be playing this week

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
And it's not Mario this week unfortunately

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
It's not related to this, but it is pretty cool right

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
Dark Sakura, Ice Cream Man

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
Oh yeah the Ice Cream Man

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
The Ice Cream Man's outside, I can't do the segment bye

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
No I'm kidding

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
Okay

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
Yes the classic game of the week is

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
Moonwalker

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
Specifically Michael Jackson's Moonwalker

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
Cause you know not to be confused with

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
Paula Abdul's Moonwalker

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
I'm going to start off on the arcade version

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
Cause the arcade version is

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
It's been hard to find lately

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
And it's different of course than the one we all remember on the Genesis

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
Which I think is pretty cool

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
Um

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
At any rate going with the arcade version

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
Um

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
You start off on sort of uh

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
It's technically side scrolling

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
But it goes

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
Diagonally

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
And you uh

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
It is a beat em up, you have magic powers

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
To attack with instead of actually just punching them

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
And you can shoot magic at them

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
And uh

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
You can also turn into the big robot

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
From uh

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
Which is the best thing ever

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
Yeah

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
And um

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
The player one is Michael in the white suit and hat

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
And then with the blue shirt

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
And then second player is

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
Red with white

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
And the third one is black with red

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
And they have those armands

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
You know that Michael Jackson is going to be really fond of

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
Um

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
Did you hear Michael's little scream there in between stages?

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
Wow

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
Hold on one more time

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
He saves the kid, he goes in the door

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
And then there's a cut scene

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
Round 2

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
Amusement quarter

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
Here we go, here we go

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
Wow

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
Although I love this little version of Smooth Criminal

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
That plays in the background

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
Let's listen to a little bit of it

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
Anyway

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
Um, of course he's got the uh

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
The dance magic

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
Which um, is sort of I guess

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
The smart bomb for the game

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
And uh

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
Basically um

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
You all get this sort of on screen

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
Logo

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
That you can activate it and then a spotlight lands

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
On you and you start to dance

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
Like regular

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
Michael Jackson moves

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
And then all the enemies on the screen start dancing

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
With you

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
And then they pass out because they

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
Can't keep up with Michael Jackson's

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
Smooth moves

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
Um, but it doesn't um

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
The bosses don't dance

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
They just take a lot of damage

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
And on screen children are not harmed of course

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
Michael has to rescue the kids

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
And then um

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
One of his power ups is Bubbles the Champion Z

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
And Bubbles

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
Is in each level and every time

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
You rescue

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
Rescue him he turns you into the giant robot

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
And then you can shoot lasers

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
Now

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
For the console

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
Of course this is what I'm sure people remember a lot

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
More of is uh

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
The one that came out on the Genesis

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
And

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
I like this one

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
Because when you go and do the dance magic thing

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
When you're standing on the piano everyone does the whole

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
Smooth criminal dance and that was just sweet

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
But that one was

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
Pretty cool and to go back to the

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
The uh songs that were in the game

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
For the arcade version the cavern one was bad

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
And the amusement quarter is smooth criminal

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
The night street is beat it

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
Graveyard is another part of me

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
And the evil fortress is uh

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
Another version of bad and then Billy Jean

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
Plays in the credits

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
And then on the Sega Genesis one

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
Which is more standard side scroller

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
Uh the stage one

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
Is smooth criminal

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
Stage two is beat it, stage three is another

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
Part of me, stage four is Billy Jean

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
And then you can perform like part of bad

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
And then stage five is bad with your special

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
Performance being smooth criminal beat it

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
Thriller if you have the REV-00

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
Version

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
Or another part of me which is the

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
REV-01

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
And uh he shouts

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
Woo

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
And in some of the cut scenes he says

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
Who's bad?

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
But he says his usual

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
Little catch phrases

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
And then um

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
But for the ad for the

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
Sega Genesis version it

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
Said that thriller was supposed to be

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
In the game but

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
It wasn't it's just the dance

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
Attack that's in

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
That one version in the

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
Last stage

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
Of course this isn't the only

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
Game that Michael Jackson has made appearances in

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
Uh there there was you know

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
Space channel five and space channel five part two

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
And he was a secret character and ready

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
To rumble boxing round two

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
So uh

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
That's pretty cool

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
But there was um

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
Also uh

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
Did you know that they were

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
Working on Michael Jackson

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
The experience game to be out on

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
Xbox 360? Yes it's um

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
Coming out it was gonna be out later this year

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
But I think it got pushed back next year now

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
It better be just like Moonwalker

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
I think it's supposed to be just like

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
Just dance

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
And singing in it

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
The game actually has

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
A rating on for

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
The PEGI has a rating for Wii's

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
Virtual console so

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
There's a talk that it should be out um

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
In Europe

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
So that's pretty cool

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
Cool game

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
Alright I don't care if people say it sucks

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
I completely disagree

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
No it was a cool arcade game

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
On the Genesis it was a little wonky but it was

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
You know it was Michael Jackson

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
It's all about the dance

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
But the best Michael Jackson game is space channel five part two

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
Oh yeah

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
Especially when you break out into the whole thriller dance

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
Oh that was awesome

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
Alright there it is your classic game of the week

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
Michael Jackson's Moonwalker for the arcade

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
Although Dark Soccer did reference the Genesis version as well

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
So that's gonna do it for part A of our

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
Program but it's not over yet guys

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
We got plenty more show to come

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
Your phone calls, your emails, rapid fire news

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
And the tweets on Twitter

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
Talk of Guitar Hero invading the Twitters

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
And Rock Band 3 information

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
And a new character confirmed for Marvel vs

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
Capcom 3 this week

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
We're gonna talk about all of that when we come right back with more

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
Of Orange Lounge Radio

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
It is episode number 381

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
Live on this Sunday evening

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
September the 12th of 2010

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
We are live of course at All Games Radio

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
Where we do tape our show live every Sunday night

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
At 6 o'clock Pacific

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
9 o'clock Eastern right after

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
The Bobby Black Wolf show

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
Although next week he's not gonna be here

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
Sad

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
So it'll just be us next Sunday holding down the fort

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
But you know what that means

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
We can take over the stream early if we want

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
We can take over the stream early

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
And then go to bed early

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
Bobby assured me that there's no best of

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
Or anything next week so

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
And the chatters are requesting another marathon

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
Okay

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
No, are you crazy?

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
We're not doing another marathon

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
I'll go live early though

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
I'll go live early

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
You can do a marathon, you can broadcast all day long

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
And then I'll come in at 6 o'clock

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
As will Loki

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
Alan may be here next week I'm not sure

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
Okay

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
Coming in right in the middle of the rebirth

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
Of Pump Up the Volume

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
Good times

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
Maybe

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
On our Twitter

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
Run my dear

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
They're already asking for an OLR-thon too

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
Too much

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
If you do it too much then it loses its effect

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
It needs to stay like a once a year type of thing

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
Of course then again this show as it is

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
Has already been going what 8 and a half years

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
So if we even make it another year that in itself

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
Is something to celebrate so that'll be good

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
Think we'll make it to 10 years? That's a long time

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
That'll be good Why not?

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
It's only 2 more years

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
Not even 2 more whole years

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
We might make it to 10 years

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
You have coffee?

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
Nescafe do you want some? Is it decaf?

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
Yes

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
It's good Alright I'll try some

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
Fine I don't have any creamer to put in

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
Except for rice milk

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
I don't know if I have any left

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
Sure why not if you're offering

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
Woot I'm getting coffee

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
And you're getting rapid fire news

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
Quick stories that uh

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
We didn't fit anywhere else in the show

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
Loki

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
Walmart has a listing for an eco

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
Shadow of the Colossus

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
Kind of a

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
Classic I don't know if you call it

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
Rema HD compilation

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
That's gonna be on the Playstation 3

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
Um

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
I could see that happening

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
And I doubt that they would make up stuff so

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
It's possible

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
I bet we'd see it come out around the same time

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
As The Last Guardian so um

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
They may be jumping the gun

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
A little bit though

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
But at least that's on there right now

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
Other news

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
There is rumors that Frank

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
West may be in

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
Dead Rising 2 as well

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
And this is coming from the

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
Kind of a teaser site

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
I guess it's a little bit viral

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
Called tape it or die

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
Um

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
Where apparently they have uh

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
Some fictional characters Johnny Pipes

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
Uh recounts seeing someone

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
else fighting by green side

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
So I go after him he says

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
Um but then I see some other dude

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
Uh vaguely recognized him

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
Maybe saw him at a party a few years back

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
Maybe a celebrity can't remember his name though

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
Phil Floyd regardless

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
He was fighting zombies

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
Um too it was like Oktoberfest

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
But replaced the beer with zombies

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
And drinking with slaughter

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
It was like I died and gone to heaven

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
Um

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
And of course I believe in one of the

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
Screenshots where they have these like

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
Photos or whatever um

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
I thought I saw Frank West actually in there

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
Yes he is actually in that

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
Photo so

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
I think it's inevitable he has to make a cameo

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
Somewhere in the game you know what I mean

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
Like he's gotta be in it or people are just gonna be

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
Pissed

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
And also there's two player co-op

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
Oh they haven't said what the second player is?

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
Nope

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
In the demos it's been just you played another

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
Chuck Green but

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
Perhaps Frank West

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
Perhaps they'll charge you 500 points as DLC

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
Perhaps they will have like a second

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
The second quest

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
As you like to put it

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
Where you can play as Frank West

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
I think more games need

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
Second quests

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
Like the original Legend of Zelda

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
Wow that's a hot cup

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
Um

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
Console modder Ben Heck

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
Is getting his own show starting

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
September 13th

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
You may remember him from

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
Such wonderful console mods

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
As the Atari 2600

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
Portable

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
And all the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
Laptops he's made

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
He does a lot of modding for different

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
Game controllers and what not

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
But he will have his own show

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
Appear on apparently

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
An internet TV channel called

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
Revision 3

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
And I guess

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
The one that does all the dig shows

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
Maybe and it's also

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
Gonna be hosted on Element 14

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
So

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
It's interesting

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
Will it be on actual television?

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
Don't know, should though

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
It'll be on Apple TV

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
That's where it'll be

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:09.000
Did the cat poop again?

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
DarkSakura just found a surprise

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
Aw poor thing

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
Any other quick stories

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
Loki, or should I move on here

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
Ah that's all I have

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
How about something about Final Fantasy

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
Dissida, you know a lot of you guys are really big fans of this game

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
It was pretty cool little

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
Final Fantasy fighting game

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
Well they've just announced

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
Dissida Duodecim

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
I guess is how you pronounce this

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
It's all Latiney words

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
Yes it is in the issue of Shonen Jump

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
Which is one of those magazines overseas

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
It's a sequel to Dissida Final Fantasy

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000
It'll be coming out on Japanese PSPs

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
In 2011

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000
Dissida Duodecim Final Fantasy

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
We don't know any new characters yet

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
Except for Final Fantasy 4's

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
Kane and Final Fantasy 13's

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
Lightning

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000
That'll be cool, no other players have been confirmed

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
Yet, but I imagine most of the roster

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000
From the first Dissida game

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
I know a lot of my friends are big fans of this game

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
So I'm sure they're going to be excited about that

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
More news on that when we know it

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
Meanwhile, for you Mac gamers

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
And I know there are some of you

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
You missed out on Grand Theft Auto 3

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
When it was the shit

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
Well miss out on this no more

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
Grand Theft Auto 3, Vice City, and San Andreas

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
A big pack of games is coming out later this year

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
That is confirmed from Rockstar's

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
Facebook for the Mac

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
I don't have a date yet or anything like that

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
But for you Mac gamers who missed out on that

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
I'm sure you're excited

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
And I know Dark Soccer is going to be first in line

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
For one of these on September 21st

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000
For the low low price of $54.99

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
A pink

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
DualShock 3

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000
Yay!

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000
How do you like that?

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000
I think I like cleaning up Shermie's poop better

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
Actually, I'll tell you something really cool

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000
Let's listen to another podcast

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
I'm terrible because I forgot the name

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000
And the gamer Edie's on, I like her

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
She's a friend of the show

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
GameHounds, that's what it's called

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000
I was listening to her show and she was interviewing the guys that made the Tron game

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000
At PAX because she was up at Penny Arcade Expo

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
Where all the cool kids were except for us

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
There is a Tron Playstation 3 controller coming out

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
That glows blue

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
And the minute I heard that I'm like, want

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000
Need, must have

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
There's something other than that coming out

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000
Something I covered for Geek Life, plug plug plug

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
Geek-Life.com

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
The collector's edition with the bike?

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000
There's a keyboard and mouse coming out

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000
That has the blue lighting on it

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
And the mouse is like one of those super nice

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
Cushioned, ergonomic

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
Really happy mice

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000
I am such a consumer whore because I want all of it

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
I really do, I want the little PS3 controller

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
I want the keyboard, I want the mouse

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000
I want the collector's edition of the game

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000
I'm sad

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000
If anyone wants to read about it you can go to

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000
Geek-Life.com and look up my Geek Cube article

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000
From a couple weeks ago

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
The shameless plug alarm

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000
Is going off

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
It's all good

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
I will have to go read about that right now

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000
While Dark Soccer

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000
Does some other stories

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
Ruining my fun, Rob

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
Well

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
And this is actually really cool

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
We were talking about this not too long ago

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
Borderlands

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000
Is getting a free update that will raise

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
The level cap and rebalance the game

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000
Oooh

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000
And it's of course across all the platforms

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
Xbox 360, PS3, PC

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000
And this was announced

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000
At PAX by the way

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000
And the download content pack is called

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000
Claptrap's New Robot Revolution

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000
And

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
It's

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000
It's going to be, I think, pretty good

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000
There were some issues

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
With, you know, the way the game played

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000
I thought, I mean otherwise it was still really fun

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000
And also

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000
They just said it was

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
Going to be the level cap at

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000
69

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000
That's funny

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
It's going to be out

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
It'll be released around October 12th

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000
When the Game of the Year edition comes out

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
Kuma JP in chat just said the Xbox

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000
Is getting one of those Tron controllers too

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000
Damn it! That's another thing I'm going to have to buy now

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000
Shit

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000
And then

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000
For next week's Rock Band download content

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000
We've got some new stuff

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
We have Holy Diver by Dio

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000
We have Stand Up and Shout by Dio

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
We have Nirvana

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000
Juliana Hatfield

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000
I haven't heard any of her stuff in a long time

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000
Wow, she's still around making music?

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000
I haven't heard her since like college

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
I think this is an older one

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000
Irish Blood English Heart by Morrissey

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000
I love Morrissey too

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000
This is totally like my

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
College music

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
This is music snob week, like it really is

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
These are all the like, my music is better than yours

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
Artists

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
Straight Lines by Silverchair

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
That's another group I listened to when I was like first going to college

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000
This Charming Man

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000
That was like the one male anorexic that we've ever heard of

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000
Was the guy in Silverchair

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
This Charming Man by the Smiths

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
It's also like Morrissey week

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
And Writing on the Walls

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000
Under Oath

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
Okay, I might have to get some points

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
The list looks pretty awesome to me

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
Which of course

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000
They're going to be

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000
Now, the dollar amount is really all the same for them

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
But the Morrissey

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
The one that's

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
Irish Heart English Blood

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000
This Charming Man and Writing on Walls are going to be

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000
160 Microsoft points each

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
While the others are 200

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
Wii points

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000
They're all going to be on

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000
All the platforms, so

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000
And then, last but not least

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
This is kind of funny, I think

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000
Is that they're putting out

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000
A

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000
Wiimote

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000
That's going to be coinciding

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000
With the Wii title

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000
Doctor Who Return to Earth

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000
It's getting a Sonic Screwdriver

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000
Wii controller, and I think that's awesome

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
It's of course based after

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000
The current 11th Doctor's

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
Sonic Screwdriver

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
Which, honestly, I still think

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000
That the best Sonic Screwdriver was

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000
10th, but that's me

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000
But it's also going to

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000
Have the voices of Matt Smith

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000
Who's currently playing the Doctor

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
And his lovely Redhead companion

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
It's going to be pretty cool

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.000
I might have to

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000
To get that, I hope it comes out over here

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
It better

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000
It very well might

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
You never know

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
By the way, just

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000
Completely random before we get into the Twitter topic

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000
Since DarkSakura brought up Rockband

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000
I know a friend of mine would be very upset

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000
If I did not mention UmLoud

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
Is officially announced for this year

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
This is the Rockband charity night

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
You play Rockband on stage

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000
You pay money to do it, but it's this whole charity thing

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
It's pretty awesome

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000
December 9th, the date has officially been announced this year

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
They switched days, if I'm not mistaken

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000
It's not on the same night of the week

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000
I think last year it was on a Monday

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000
And this year it's going to be on a Thursday

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
So it's moving up

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000
And apparently one of the big things they're doing this year

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000
There's going to be a headliner band

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
That they're going to auction away

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000
That's pretty cool

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
They're just going to sing Lady Gaga

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000
And we'll call ourselves Victoria and the Gays

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000
I'm really excited about that

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000
So you might have to come out and watch us rock it

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000
At UmLoud, but they do an internet stream too

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000
Which I want to say was very well trafficked last year

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
And you can donate to a good cause

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000
It's all for child's play, etc, etc

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.000
I will make sure Se gets on the show to talk about this

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000
At some point

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
If he doesn't come on I will be sad

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
Moving on, let's get to some Twitter topics

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000
Some tweets

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000
The Twitters

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000
If you want to send us some tweets

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000
Oops, I just closed them

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000
Because I'm a genius

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000
I was on the Twitter page

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
And my fat finger clicked the button

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
And I moved to a new page

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000
And now Twitter is giving me the fail whale

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000
That's great

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000
Oh, here we go

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
Sbhail is asking

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000
Was going to ask what you guys thought about the Sony move

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000
But Rob's Twit pic already answered my question

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000
I didn't post a picture of me holding the

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000
Move controllers in a productive manner

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000
Or anything

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000
Well let me rephrase the question for Loki

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000
Because he already talked about the Sony move earlier in the show

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000
If you could sum up the Sony move in three words

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000
Loki, what would they be?

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000
Just like Nintendo

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000
Nice

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000
Let's see

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000
Tigerclaw is giving us some links tonight

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000
Steam is launching

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
A beta for the Steam wallet

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000
Payment option

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000
Apparently this is something they're beta testing

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
Instead of using a debit

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000
Or credit card

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000
You can actually use money out of your card

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000
And put it in a Steam wallet

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
And then use the money to buy the game

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000
Not sure how this works

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
Or why this is practical

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
I'm assuming it's some type of middle thing

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
Where your parents, when you're good

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000
Will put $25 in your Steam wallet

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000
And then you as the child

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000
Can spend that on whatever

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000
I'm thinking that's what this is

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000
It's kind of like a fancy gift certificate

01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.000
I guess very soon

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000
It's being beta tested right now

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000
Also from Tigerclaw

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000
Because I'm nice and allowing two tweets tonight

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000
The Xbox Live murderer

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000
Was sentenced to two life sentences

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
Oh the sad thing is

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000
I look at this and I go

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000
Which Xbox Live murderer?

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000
Because unfortunately there's been a lot of them

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000
Well a jury convicted

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000
Let's see, what's the name of the asshole in this case?

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000
23 year old

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
Derek Lee Hernandez

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000
Two mandatory life sentences

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
Congratulations, no parole

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
He killed 22 year old

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000
Jason Holly

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000
And it was a jury of six men and six women

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000
Who deliberated over two days

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000
Found him guilty

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000
Oh man

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000
I'm not even going to go into the gritty details

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000
About this

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000
Oh this was the guy, he was mentally challenged

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000
And the guy

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000
Kind of took advantage of him

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000
Remember this? This was the judge

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000
He wanted to be your friend Mr. Hernandez

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000
He would have done whatever you asked him

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000
And you took advantage of that

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000
You tricked him into coming up to the mountains

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000
And there was no other reason than to take his life

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.000
And yeah it was all this whole like

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000
That he

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000
Took the 360

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000
From the poor guy

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000
It's messed up

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000
But it really has nothing to do with games

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
Again I hate these senseless murder things

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000
Alright

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
Moving on, moving on, moving on

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
Blue Swim

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000
Sending us a tweet

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000
What are your biggest gaming surprises

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
And disappointments of the current console

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000
Generation? Great job on the marathon show

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000
Loved it

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000
Biggest gaming surprises and disappointments of the current console generation

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000
From Blue Swim

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
Anyone?

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000
I would say biggest surprise would be

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000
LittleBigPlanet in a way

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
I didn't think I'd like that as much as I did

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
Biggest disappointment

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000
Is probably

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000
The Xbox Live game shows

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000
1 vs 100

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000
Going away so quickly

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000
And without replacement

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
Anyone?

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
Uh

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000
Hmm

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000
I don't really

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000
Have any major surprises

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
Or anything I mean really I mean LittleBigPlanet

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000
I kind of expected it to do big

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000
Um

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000
I guess I'm kind of surprised about Final Fantasy 14

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
Sucking so bad

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000
So I guess that's a disappointment

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
Loki anything?

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000
Um

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000
Let's see I would say

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000
Disappointing would be

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000
Nintendo and them grasping

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000
Online because

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000
They really haven't and I know that they have

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000
They have stuff in their store in fact

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000
I think the question is

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000
We should be posing is

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
When's the last time that we've actually had a

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
Virtual console release from them?

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000
Oh oh

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000
No disappointment I know the biggest disappointment

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
PlayStation Home

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
So much potential just down the toilet

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
And to bounce off of that

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
Um

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
I would have to say probably

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
Um

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000
Was it Microsoft's wonderful

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000
Arcade thing

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000
Game room Game room yeah

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000
Uh

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000
ActDeft in chat says

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000
The greatest surprise was Earth Defense

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
Force

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000
Which funny enough leads into Blue Swim's

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000
Other tweets

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000
Loki might recognize where Blue Swim's from in a minute here

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000
And he says also

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000
If I got Loki or OLR in hot water with

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000
D3 publisher for the EDF story on CheapAssGamer

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000
I apologize

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000
Just wanted to share the EDF news and hopefully

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000
Send some new listeners OLR's way in the process

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
Nah I know you didn't hear anything and you didn't

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
Send any listeners our way because no one realized

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000
That you know it was from Orange Island

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000
But your blog got a lot of hits

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000
It was CheapAssGamer was the source of that story

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000
Yeah because clearly they talked about it

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000
On their show

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000
No we don't blame you Blue Swim

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000
Oh I know you're just excited

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
Like Loki is about the game

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000
Remember I did add

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000
A little something though

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
Remember it's not just 360

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000
This time

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000
Uh let's see

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000
DarkKisuke sends us a tweet saying

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000
You guys should play Dead Space for a show

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000
Maybe the next marathon show

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000
We don't usually play a lot of games on air while we're trying to do the show

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000
It's a little bit distracting

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
For entertainment

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000
This question might be inappropriate

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
So ready the inappropriate alarm

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000
DarkSakura could you ready the inappropriate alarm?

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000
Alright

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.000
Cause this question's for you for entertainment

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.000
Does DarkSakura have a vibrator

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000
To compare the PS3 dildo sticks to?

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000
Dildo sticks too

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000
No

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000
I had to think about it

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000
I had to think about it I don't think anything I have

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000
Her vibrators are uncomparable

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000
No mine aren't USB

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000
Spazinator PSN

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000
Oh this is a good question

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000
I totally forgot about this one

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000
Senses tweet feel like touching on the whole

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000
contemporary banning from Xbox Live

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000
Because some guy lived in Fort Gay

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000
West Virginia

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000
Please tell me you guys heard about this

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000
The guy put in his bio that he lived in Fort Gay

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000
West Virginia

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.000
He got banned from Xbox Live

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000
I thought though that they were stopping

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000
They weren't banning people from that stuff nowadays

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000
I think

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.000
When it was looked at

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000
Some people thought

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000
That he was calling West Virginia

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000
Gay or something

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000
It's not gay it's Fort Gay

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000
There is

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000
It is a maximum security

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000
Gay facility

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000
Coincidentally is going to be the name of the OLR Fort

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.000
That DarkSakura is going to take over someday

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000
Fort Gay

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000
Fort Gay?

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.000
Because it means happy

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000
And we'll paint it rainbow

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000
Because everyone loves a rainbow

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000
Especially a double rainbow

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
What does it mean?

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000
I thought the fortress of sodomy

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000
That's next door

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000
Alright

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000
Obviously they're wearing egg

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000
On their face over the whole thing

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000
It's an excellent

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000
Case of the corporate

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000
Web and how the corporate

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.000
Web allowed that thing to spiral

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000
Way out of control because you know

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.000
There were rules that were set and this guy

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000
Is saying hey I

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000
Live there, google it

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:21.000
It's a real place

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.000
For you and me that's where it should have ended

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.000
But unfortunately thanks to corporate

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000
Webs it didn't end there and caused

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000
A nightmare so now Microsoft

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.000
Is going to have to look at their

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.000
Corporate policy

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.000
To make sure this kind of dumb shit doesn't happen

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000
Again

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:39.000
And Tigerclaw is saying

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.000
That Microsoft better be careful because

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.000
There is actually someone who lives in fucking

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000
Australia

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000
Isn't there a

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000
France or something

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000
I think there is another town called fucking

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.000
Fucking Australia

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.000
Oh no it's Austria not Australia

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:57.000
That's what I get when I read too fast

01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:59.000
Fucking Austria

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000
Sorry Australia

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000
Readest town ever

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.000
That's what I say when I realize

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.000
Arnold Schwarzenegger really is the governor

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000
Fucking Austria, alright no just kidding

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000
I'm kidding, I'm kidding

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.000
AlphaCananagram is sending us a tweet

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:15.000
ChooChooRocket is coming back

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.000
That's kind of cool

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.000
ChooChooRocket is on its way out on the iPhone

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.000
It's going to be out in October

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:23.000
It might be coming to

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000
Xbox Live and Playstation Network

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000
We don't know but it might be

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000
Apparently it needs enough support on

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000
Facebook, it's a big Facebook

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000
Trend thing

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.000
Let's see DJ Rama S appeals court

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.000
Ruling threatens used

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000
Software sales, uh oh

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.000
That can't be good

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000
He sends us a link here to this news

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000
Let's see

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000
A federal appeals court has sided with the computer software

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.000
In its effort to squelch sales of second hand programs

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.000
Covered by widely used licensing

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.000
Agreements

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000
Let's see I'm looking here

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:57.000
A doctrine refers to a 102 year old decision

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.000
By the US Supreme Court that determined copyright holders

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.000
Can't prevent a buyer from

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.000
Reselling or renting a product after an initial

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000
Sale as long as additional copies

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:07.000
Aren't made

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:09.000
A three judge panel in the 9th district

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.000
Concluded that first

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.000
Sale doctrine didn't apply to used

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.000
Software programs that online merchant

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000
Timothy Verner peddled in his

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000
Store on Ebay

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:21.000
Oh this might not be good

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000
I have to read up more on this later

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.000
I haven't seen this covered on a lot of sites

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.000
Well

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.000
We'll see what the legal mumbo jumbo

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000
Is as it comes to this

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000
This is just like the first of many

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000
Things

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000
Alright

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000
And SSJ100Matt on twitter is saying

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000
Comedy site zug.com pulled a real life

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.000
Lemmings prank in downtown

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000
Boston oh this has got to be interesting

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.000
Is this like a little video or something

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000
Wow they actually dressed up in what looks

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.000
Like blue snuggies and green wigs

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.000
This is like one of those like stupid flash mob

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:57.000
Things I'm looking at the thing on youtube

01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:59.000
Yep so there they go

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:01.000
They're walking into the water and falling in

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.000
This is the dumbest thing I've ever

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.000
Seen in my life

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.000
I love how there's all these college kids in the back

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.000
That like don't even care

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.000
Some people have too much time on their hands

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.000
But I love the look I love the snuggies as outfits

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.000
And lastly

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.000
Marin Marvel on twitter is saying

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:26.000
I'm totally guest hosting on OLR on October 1st

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.000
When Sky is out of town

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:30.000
You should it'll be fun

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.000
Actually you shouldn't you should come to Disneyland

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.000
With me you know Disneyland is better than this show

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.000
Sorry just saying

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:38.000
Just saying

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000
That's it for the tweeters tonight

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:42.000
OLR

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.000
Back to gaming news Loki

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:46.000
Ah yes so speaking

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:48.000
Of tweets

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:50.000
This is retarded but

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.000
I guess the natural progression of

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.000
Stuff

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000
Guitar Hero Warriors

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:58.000
Rock will be the first

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.000
Guitar Hero game

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:02.000
I can't see this with any less

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.000
Enthusiasm to integrate

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.000
Twitter and Facebook

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:08.000
Hurrah

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:10.000
Everybody can know when you do

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:12.000
Stuff in this game

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:14.000
Like I give a shit

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.000
But yes

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:18.000
It will be coming is confirmed on the Wii

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.000
I can tell you right now

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.000
Based off the presentation that was given to me

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.000
By the Activision reps

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:26.000
It is also coming to the Playstation 3 and the Xbox 360

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.000
Which is not a big surprise

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:30.000
Um

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.000
Yes and apparently they've also

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.000
Incorporated a Wii award system

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:36.000
So when you do specific challenges in the game

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:38.000
You get credited for an award

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:40.000
And then you can share those online

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:42.000
With your friends

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.000
And if you share those online with your friends

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.000
They're gonna block you

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000
That's right

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.000
Now my steam is working

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000
So

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000
Hurrah

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.000
And guess what though at least you know

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:58.000
Well you already know this but I mean if you

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.000
Buy guitar hero early you get a CD

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000
Of like

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:04.000
Actual songs that are included in the game

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:06.000
Soundgarden's new album

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:08.000
Interesting tactic

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:10.000
If you like Soundgarden I guess

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:12.000
Yeah I'll be blocking that on Facebook

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:14.000
Pretty quickly no offense

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:16.000
Not really my thing

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.000
Hey but there's more details on Rock Band 3

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.000
I'm excited about this

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000
No Twitter or Facebook integration here

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.000
Actually they are confirming that you will be

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:26.000
Able to export Rock Band 2 tracks

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.000
For a fee

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.000
The export feature will work on all three

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.000
Consoles of course there's always a couple

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.000
Of songs that get a little weird

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.000
So you can imagine that a couple songs

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.000
Are gonna fall off the list unfortunately

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:40.000
But most of them should come over for a small fee

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000
That's really cool

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:44.000
Regular download content will remain the regular

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.000
Price that's $2 per song but

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:48.000
They are saying that for Rock Band 3's

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:50.000
Pro mode

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:52.000
The songs will probably be more expensive

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:54.000
Because there's more work that has to be done on

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.000
These tracks and they don't want to increase

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:58.000
The cost of regular download content

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:00.000
To subsidize the pro download content

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:02.000
That's aimed at a smaller group of players

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:04.000
Usually I'd be a little worried about this

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.000
But I go you know what I feel like

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:08.000
Harmonix kind of does the download content

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.000
Better than almost anyone right now so I'm like

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.000
Okay I trust them

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.000
Like I don't know how you guys feel but I'm just kind of like okay

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:16.000
If that's what they say I trust them

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:18.000
They get it

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000
They've proved that they understand download content for a very long time

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.000
This export feature is great

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.000
You know yeah it's a fee but

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:26.000
I understand it's out of their hands and it's licensing

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.000
At least they bother to do it at all

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.000
I kind of go okay they know what they're doing

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:32.000
If that's what they say then I agree

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:36.000
Plus it also makes sense that the Rock Band

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:38.000
Stuff would cost a little more

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:40.000
In the pro mode because there's probably less people

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.000
Buying them too you know

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:44.000
Yeah I mean you have to have the pro mode instruments

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:46.000
And stuff like that which are really expensive

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:48.000
Well at least on the guitar

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:50.000
It's really expensive but

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:52.000
You know the keyboard's not so much

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.000
I don't know

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:56.000
I wouldn't want to pay extra for that stuff

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.000
But if you really want to

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:00.000
There's a market for it

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:02.000
I'm interested in the pro mode stuff

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:04.000
Especially for keyboards

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.000
Because once you learn how to like play the song

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.000
On a keyboard you could actually go to like a piano

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.000
Or whatever and play it I think that's awesome

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.000
If you can memorize it so

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000
I'm looking forward to trying that out

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.000
That's going to be very cool

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:18.000
So we're going to go over to Dark Sakura

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:20.000
Who's got another story for us here

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.000
I sure do

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:24.000
Coming up very soon the mailbag

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:26.000
From Marvel versus Capcom the FUs of the week

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.000
And your calls

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.000
Well we've got a new challenger in

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:32.000
For Marvel versus Capcom 3

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.000
And this is

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.000
Pretty pretty sweet

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:38.000
But we're getting Tron Bonn

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:40.000
That's so cool

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:42.000
She's kind of on crack

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:44.000
She's kind of been in like

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:46.000
A lot of the fighting games right

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.000
Give us the new Mega Man Legends already

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:50.000
I hate you

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.000
Servbots have been in the background

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:54.000
In Capcom, they're so cute

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:56.000
They look like Lego Men

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:58.000
Yeah I agree though, where's Mega Man Legends

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:00.000
There is coming but it's

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.000
It's just going to take forever

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:04.000
I would buy that on PS1 Classics if I could

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:06.000
Is that available? I don't think it is

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.000
For PS1 Classics

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:10.000
Damn you Capcom

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:12.000
Just when you're doing so many things right

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.000
There's that one thing

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:16.000
One thing

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:18.000
You know with

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:20.000
Let's say that the

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.000
Homebrew scene or pirating scene

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.000
However you want to call it

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:26.000
Gets to where it is on the PSP

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:28.000
They have ways to convert

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.000
PS1 ISO files into

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:32.000
A playable format on the

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:34.000
PlayStation emulator that's on the

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:36.000
PSP so you can port

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:38.000
Mega Man Legends or something like that

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:40.000
If they can do it for the PSP

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.000
They may be able to do it for the PS3

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:44.000
Very nice

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:46.000
Or I could just find the PS1 disc somewhere and play it

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:48.000
My PS3

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:50.000
Is that hard to find?

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:52.000
No they're not

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:54.000
I don't remember the game being particularly rare

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:56.000
I could be wrong but

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:58.000
Yeah

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:00.000
Anyhow speaking of Mega Man Loki right?

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000
Yes speaking of Mega Man

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.000
There's some new details coming out

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:06.000
About Mega Man Universe

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:08.000
And it's kind of cool

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:10.000
The game itself looks a little bit like

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:12.000
It could be similar to the Mega Man

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:14.000
Powered up Mega Man

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:16.000
Which was on the PSP

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:18.000
It showed a level editor

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:20.000
That's awesome

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.000
That you'll be able to share of course

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:24.000
With your friends

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:26.000
Different levels that you've made

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:28.000
It's Little Big Mega Man

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:30.000
Isn't that what this game is turning into?

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:32.000
It seriously is getting pretty awesome

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.000
And they had some other screenshots

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:36.000
That showed

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:38.000
Different playable characters

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:40.000
They had a screenshot that actually showed

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:42.000
The box art Mega Man plane

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:44.000
Also you can create

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:46.000
New Mega Man characters by

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:48.000
Mixing and matching different parts

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:50.000
Like different heads and what not

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:54.000
Really cool stuff and also I guess

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:56.000
They're saying that

02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:58.000
Of course there's going to be the

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:00.000
Ryu Mega Man that's in there

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:02.000
Probably the ghosts and goblins Mega Man

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:06.000
Mega Men

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:08.000
Mega Men yes

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:10.000
In fact here's the screenshot there of

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:12.000
The box art one which

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.000
Is so ugly

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:16.000
Well you know this isn't the first time that Mega Man's had

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:18.000
Street Fighter moves

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:20.000
Because remember in X2

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:22.000
He could get the Hadoken and Shoryuken

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:24.000
If you did the special

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:26.000
Level thing

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:28.000
Which I could do

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:30.000
But the game itself though

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:32.000
I'm kind of rusty when it comes to

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:34.000
Identifying my Mega Man stages

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:36.000
But I'm wondering if it's going to have

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:38.000
More than just

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.000
It looks like Mega Man

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:42.000
2 characters

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:44.000
It looks very Mega Man 2 inspired

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:46.000
Doesn't it? I'm wondering if it's going to have more than that

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:48.000
That might be cool. Alpha Cananagram

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:50.000
In the chat is quick to correct me on things

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:52.000
He says Mega Man powered up with

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:54.000
The level editor came out 2 years before

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:56.000
Little Big Planet

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:58.000
True enough I suppose but I don't know

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:00.000
I kind of feel like Little Big Planet's

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:02.000
Really made the splash you know what I mean I don't know

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:04.000
Yeah

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:06.000
But ok sure so this idea is

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:08.000
Not entirely new for the Mega Man series

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:12.000
Well I know I'm interested in the game

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:14.000
I'm going to buy it. Is it arcade or is it retail?

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:16.000
Have they said? Arcade

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:18.000
Oh man that's going to be a heck of an arcade game

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:20.000
Hopefully it's not more than

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:22.000
20 bucks but watch them be charging like 30

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:26.000
If there's going to be a game that's going to break the price barrier

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:28.000
Yet again it'll be this. Watch

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:30.000
We'll see though

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:32.000
Hopefully not

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:34.000
If they do try to break the barrier

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:36.000
It might leave Valve to talk even more smack

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:38.000
About Xbox Live. Oh you haven't heard

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:40.000
Valve has apparently talked some smack

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:42.000
About Xbox Live

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:44.000
This is kind of interesting because I seem to recall

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:46.000
Some time ago it was just the reverse

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.000
They used to dog on Playstation 3

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.000
And they were supporting Xbox Live

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:52.000
With exclusives such as Portal still alive

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:54.000
Well times have changed a little bit

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:56.000
Haven't they?

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:58.000
Gabe Newell has referred to Xbox Live as a

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:00.000
Train Wreck

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:02.000
Quote, we thought that there would be something that would emerge

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:04.000
Because we figured it was sort of untenable

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:06.000
Oh yeah we understand that these are the rules now

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:08.000
But it's such a train wreck that something

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:10.000
Will have to change

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:12.000
That's why we're really happy with the current situation with the Playstation 3

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:14.000
We're solving it now in a way that is going to work

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:16.000
For our customers rather than assuming

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:18.000
Something is going to emerge later

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:20.000
That will allow us to fix this

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:22.000
Yikes

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.000
They're saying that Microsoft has got to change the

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:26.000
Online policies if they want to compete

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:28.000
You know I want to say though not the first person

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:30.000
To dog a little bit on Xbox Live

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:32.000
This kind of reminds me of Square Enix

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:34.000
Coming out a little bit ago saying that

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:36.000
Final Fantasy 14 is not coming out on the

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:38.000
Xbox 360 because Xbox Live

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:40.000
Just ain't going to work

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:44.000
That's what they're saying

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:46.000
Very interesting

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:48.000
Yeah

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:50.000
It's interesting to me

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:52.000
Kind of how Valve has come full circle

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:54.000
I mean and I can see the reasons

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:56.000
Why to an extent

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:58.000
And certainly again not the first developer

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:00.000
To say bad things about

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:02.000
Xbox Live but it's just very interesting

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:04.000
How much things have changed in a few years

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:06.000
There you go

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:08.000
Let's get to the mail bag

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:10.000
Shall we? Dark Soccer you ready to rip open the email

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:12.000
Bag and read some emails for us here?

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:14.000
I'm ready to rip something

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:22.000
Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:24.000
If you want to send us any emails to be read on the

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:26.000
Air. Did we get some emails? The mailbag was pretty

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:28.000
Thin going into tonight's show. Did we get some?

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:30.000
We got a few

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:32.000
The first one's from awesomedude slash troy

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:38.000
Now this is the philosophical question I gave us some

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:40.000
Warning

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:42.000
Even though my emails might be getting monotonous

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:44.000
From the consistency of pointless ones

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:46.000
This question actually has meaning

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:48.000
Now I have had this brewing

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:50.000
In my head for a couple of days

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:52.000
And I'm afraid I might not be able to do it

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:54.000
Either before well I leave this

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:56.000
Dying ball of life we call Earth

02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:58.000
Yeah I just tried to make that sound cool

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:00.000
If you had to choose changing

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:02.000
The world and leaving your mark on it or

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:04.000
Living your life with a loved one which one would you choose?

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:06.000
You know what I would choose?

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:08.000
I don't see why you can't do both

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:10.000
Jeez

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:12.000
I know it's tricky because what's going to

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:14.000
Prevent me from doing one over the other it's

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:16.000
Strange um

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.000
What if by being with somebody you leave your mark

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:20.000
On the world? I kind of feel like

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:22.000
Okay this is going to sound really cheesy but I feel

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:24.000
Like in a way this show has left the mark

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:26.000
On the world a little bit

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:28.000
Like maybe not in a totally like

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:30.000
Amazing humanitarian

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:32.000
Mother Teresa kind of way

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:34.000
But just some of the really nice

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:36.000
Emails that I've got over the years

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:38.000
Especially from like you know other

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:40.000
Guys who sometimes struggle

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:42.000
With oops not the FU music yet

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:44.000
Um sometimes other guys who've like struggled

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:46.000
With coming out and stuff and saying that like

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:48.000
Hearing me on the show has helped with that like the power

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:50.000
Of an email like that is like

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:52.000
Really hard to put into words

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:54.000
And just like in how that makes you feel

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:56.000
Like you've really had an impact and I know

02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:58.000
You know there's there's quote unquote fans

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:00.000
Of all of us out there which is such a strange

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:02.000
Feeling because we're pretty normal

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:04.000
People we just like video games and

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:06.000
Figured out how to do this radio thing pretty

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:08.000
Quickly and have stayed pretty dedicated to it

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:10.000
Um that those kind of words have been amazing

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:12.000
So I kind of feel like in some ways

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:14.000
I've already picked the first option

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:16.000
Because I'm not living with a loved

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:18.000
One right now the dark soccer is

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:20.000
Doing both yeah so

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:22.000
It's tough because you're asking me to backtrack

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:24.000
I don't know I don't see

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:26.000
Why you can't do both I mean what's the

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:28.000
They're not mutually exclusive

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:30.000
Plus if you live with a loved

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:32.000
One aren't you leaving your mark

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:34.000
On the world

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:36.000
With that relationship I know that sounds

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:38.000
So weird but a little bit my philosophy

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:40.000
Is that the best way to change the world

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:42.000
And leave your mark is to be an active

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:44.000
Part of making it better

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:46.000
To

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:48.000
Not be a dick to people

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:50.000
You know

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:52.000
To

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:54.000
You know if you've got the extra time

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:56.000
And you're just sitting on your butt

02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:58.000
You know go volunteer or something

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:00.000
There's nothing to say that you can't do

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:02.000
Both just love people

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:04.000
And it doesn't mean I don't mean like sex

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:06.000
I don't mean like love like kissy

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:08.000
Kissy I just mean like there's all different types

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:10.000
Of love there's platonic love there's

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:12.000
Family love brotherly love

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:14.000
You know there is romantic love there's

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:16.000
Love for earth I don't mean

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:18.000
To sound like a hippie or whatever but

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:20.000
I think that's kind of what a lot of it's about

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:22.000
Isn't it? You've nailed it on the head

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:24.000
Just

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:26.000
Don't love people

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:28.000
People get all butt hurt over their own political

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:30.000
You know points of view being

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:32.000
Hey everyone's gotta believe what I do

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:34.000
Man

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:36.000
But you know if everyone was exactly the same

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:38.000
It would be boring

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:40.000
And we would stagnate

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:42.000
It's those differences that put a challenge

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:44.000
We would be the Borg

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:46.000
I am a firm believer that people don't

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:48.000
Grow without a challenge

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:50.000
That you have to have that challenge for people to overcome

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:52.000
And if they don't overcome those are the people who don't

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:54.000
Get to do anything in the world

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:56.000
You know they're just gonna

02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:00.000
I have a hard time putting this

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:02.000
Because some people are content to live their life

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:04.000
Just being themselves

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:06.000
You know not doing anything

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:08.000
But I think that the best

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:10.000
Way to grow and challenge

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:12.000
Yourself is to

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:14.000
Move outside your comfort zone

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:16.000
To do something that's gonna make it better

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:18.000
Because nothing changes until you make a change

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:20.000
Well

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:22.000
That has nothing to do with games

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:24.000
That was a very deep email for this program

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:26.000
But hey sorry to dodge your question

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:28.000
But hope you got out of it

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:30.000
Loki didn't say anything

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:32.000
Eh

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:34.000
There I said something

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:36.000
Oh Loki

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:38.000
Next email

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:40.000
Hi OLR crew this is your friendly neighborhood Mexican act

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:42.000
I wanted to tell you that you did a pretty damn

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:44.000
Good job with the marathon on Sunday

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:46.000
Slash Monday I wish I could have been

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:48.000
There while this was live but I

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:50.000
Did catch the podcast

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:52.000
Is this

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:54.000
You about many interesting topics

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:56.000
Like favorite game and soundtracks

02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:58.000
I guess it's you spoke about many interesting

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:00.000
Topics like favorite game and soundtracks

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:02.000
And other stuff since I wasn't there to participate in

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:04.000
The chat room I would like to participate to

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:06.000
That with this email

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:08.000
My favorite game and probably my favorite

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:10.000
Soundtrack of all time is Kirby Superstar

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:12.000
So many different games to choose

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:14.000
From and they're pretty detailed with puzzles

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:16.000
And pretty good platforming

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:18.000
Actdeft likes Kirby you don't say

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:20.000
I didn't know I hadn't heard

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:22.000
Hey No it's funny that's cool

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:24.000
And the soundtrack to it is pretty amazing

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:26.000
And probably since then

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:28.000
It has made me so interested in video music

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:30.000
Like I am now

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:32.000
Video game music sorry

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:34.000
I would really recommend people getting

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:36.000
Kirby Superstar Ultra on the DS

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:38.000
Make it worthy

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:40.000
Make it worthy of any DS game library

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:42.000
But not as all

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:44.000
Happy game wise

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:46.000
Excuse me

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:48.000
You also talked about disappointment

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:50.000
Mine was Final Fantasy 8

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:52.000
Got it for cheap but I still think I got robbed

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:54.000
Hey let me finish

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:56.000
Well I don't like Final Fantasy 7 either

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:58.000
At least in

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:00.000
At least decent in lots of things

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:02.000
Final Fantasy 8 really takes all the good things

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:04.000
Of the series and burns them to the ground

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:06.000
The card game is damn awful

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:08.000
I never played the card game for the record

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:10.000
And it doesn't give you a real good incentive

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:12.000
To play it kind of like Blitzball and Final Fantasy 10

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:14.000
Which I didn't really do either

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:16.000
But the thing I hate the most

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:18.000
About the whole damn game is the story

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:20.000
It sucks bad it's terra bad

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:22.000
I don't even like Final Fantasy 10

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:24.000
Pretty much for the same things

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:26.000
But I didn't buy it and even though the battle system

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:28.000
And grid system is kind of cool

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:30.000
Final Fantasy 8 really I don't give a crap about that game

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.000
See he doesn't like it for the wrong reasons

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:34.000
Cause I think the story was actually

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:36.000
It's strongest part it's the battles

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:38.000
That really did it in for me

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:40.000
But from what I play to the beta

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:42.000
14 very well might be worse than 8

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:44.000
Like I don't know yet

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:46.000
I guess I will have to play the retail version

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:48.000
At some point to give you my final thoughts

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:50.000
But there may be a new challenger

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:52.000
For the worst Final Fantasy game ever

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:54.000
Oh no the new challenger has appeared

02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:56.000
I'll let you know

02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:58.000
Oh well that's all for now I will talk about other stuff

02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:00.000
You talked about next week

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:02.000
I don't want to send a big ass email

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:04.000
Too late no I'm kidding

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:06.000
Until next time

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:08.000
P.S. I still don't believe that Duke Nukem Forever will get released

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:10.000
We'll see

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:14.000
And I wonder if this one

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:16.000
I think it will now that it's with the new developer

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:18.000
I think that's what had to happen

02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:20.000
It just needed to be taken by somebody else

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:22.000
It'll come out now

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:24.000
Next email

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:26.000
When you guys were young did you ever play a game

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:28.000
That was so horrible but there was something about it

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:30.000
That always kept you playing

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:32.000
One bad game that comes to mind is Banjo-Kazooie

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:34.000
I spent countless hours sitting in front of my parents TV screen

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:36.000
Trying to collect all those little

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:38.000
Glowing puzzle pieces

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:40.000
I wanted to punch the TV screen every time the crazy

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:42.000
Bear and bird spoke

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:44.000
However for some unknown reason I kept playing till I beat it

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:46.000
Today I cringe when I hear any song from that game

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:48.000
What about you guys?

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:50.000
Your fellow girl gamer Ziba

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:52.000
Clash at Demonhead

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:54.000
Totally

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:56.000
It's not that great a game really

02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:58.000
It's definitely a guilty pleasure game

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:00.000
I used to love that game and I don't know why

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:02.000
As far as old school 8-bit NES games go

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:06.000
I really can't remember any

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:08.000
There's games that pissed me off that I'd keep playing

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:10.000
Like Puzzle and Desu

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:12.000
I'm sorry, you remember I covered that on Classic Game?

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:14.000
That game pisses me off so much

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:18.000
And it's really not even the best game ever

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:20.000
But the challenge is so hard to it

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:22.000
Ugh, that game pisses me off

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:24.000
What about you, Loki?

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:30.000
Earth Defense Force

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:32.000
It gets really challenging

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:34.000
Especially when you get on those inferno levels

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:36.000
Sometimes it makes me want to hurt somebody

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:38.000
And I just play more of it

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:40.000
Good call

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:42.000
Last email

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:44.000
No!

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:46.000
Hey, OLR, emailing in on a few things

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:48.000
That I wouldn't recommend

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:52.000
But I know I would forget, so here it goes

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:54.000
I know this news is two weeks late

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:56.000
But Sony not only has their dreaded online pass

02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:58.000
On some sports games

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:00.000
But it's on an awesome PSP FPS

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:02.000
Called SOCOM Fireteam Bravo 3

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:04.000
Also, this may be old news

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:06.000
But I've never heard this on the radio

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:08.000
Any radio which makes me laugh

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:10.000
Any of you heard of a game

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:12.000
Called Minecraft?

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:14.000
I've never heard of it

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:16.000
I've never heard of it

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:18.000
Any of you heard of a game called Minecraft?

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:20.000
Don't judge on graphics

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:22.000
Although you guys probably wouldn't

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:24.000
My way of describing it would be

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:26.000
Awesomesauce imagination orgasm

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.000
Okay

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:30.000
You have unlimited boundaries

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:32.000
North, south, east, and west

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:34.000
And you can go really far up and down

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:36.000
And it's only in alpha

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:38.000
Give it a try and decide whether or not to buy it

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:40.000
It's only 10 euros or about 13 bucks

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:42.000
And it entitles you to play future releases of the game

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:44.000
And he put the address

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:46.000
C-R-A-F-T dot net

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:48.000
Is he a co-producer or writer?

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:50.000
I don't know. I don't think so

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:52.000
Currently it has only one developer

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:54.000
But he's awesome

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:56.000
Here's the bullshit part

02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:58.000
He's been making so much money from people paying for it

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:00.000
PayPal fucking froze his account

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:02.000
Due to a suspicious withdrawal or deposit

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:04.000
That's pretty funny

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:06.000
Um

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:08.000
I'm actually gonna look at this real quick

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:10.000
Cause I wouldn't

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:12.000
Hitstun in our chatroom says there's a lot of Minecraft

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:14.000
On Justin TV

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:16.000
It doesn't look that bad

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:18.000
It looks really, um

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:20.000
Super Nintendo-ish 3D

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:22.000
But yeah

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:24.000
Apparently he

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:26.000
It was over 600,000 euros

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:28.000
And then

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:32.000
PayPal is like trying to keep the money or something

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:34.000
That's weird

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:36.000
That's kinda screwed up

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:38.000
Anyway, gonna continue

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:40.000
Minecraft may seem odd

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:42.000
But it's great and freaking addictive

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:44.000
When you realize all the possible things you can do

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:46.000
Slash make

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:48.000
Um, well, I think that's enough for one email

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:50.000
But I'll chat slash call in if I have anything else of interest

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:52.000
That comes up

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:54.000
May the Flying Spaghetti Monster bless your souls

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:56.000
DarkCuseK AKA Butcher

02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:58.000
Raw man

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:00.000
P.S. Gonna be super sad to not hear your voices next week

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:02.000
I guess he's not gonna be listening next week

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:04.000
Oh, oh

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:06.000
I forgot

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:08.000
He sent us a tweet that said disregard is P.S.

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:10.000
Oopsie

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:12.000
Whoops

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:14.000
Screwed up on that one

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:16.000
I think he might have us mixed up with Bobby Black Wolf

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:18.000
Cause Bobby's not live next week

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:20.000
Oh, YouTube

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:22.000
Alan sent me this YouTube

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:24.000
And if Alan sent it to me I have to look at it

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:26.000
He told me a little bit about what it is

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:28.000
And I'd heard of this

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:30.000
And it sounds kinda cool

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:32.000
Oh, it's like, uh, stop motion

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:34.000
All these people in colored shirts

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:36.000
Sitting in chairs

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:38.000
Doing Pac-Man

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:40.000
They do these in a movie theater

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:42.000
That's kind of rad

02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:46.000
Can Alan link that in chat?

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:48.000
Please? Thank you

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:50.000
I like the little noise in the background

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:52.000
Let me turn that up a little bit

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:54.000
Doo doo doo doo doo

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:06.000
I love the noises more than anything

02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:08.000
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:10.000
Okay, anyway, this makes for terrible radio

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:12.000
People did a Space Invaders one

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:14.000
That takes a lot of work

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:16.000
Like, that took all day

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:20.000
God

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:22.000
College kids

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:24.000
Y'all had too much free time

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:26.000
It's a lot of its editing though

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:28.000
Because all they had to do was get one scene

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:30.000
Where everybody was sitting in the grid

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:32.000
In the beginning

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:34.000
And then just take one shot of that and keep superimposing

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:36.000
Where he's at

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:38.000
It does take a lot of effort

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:40.000
But it's not as much as

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:42.000
They used magic and witchcraft

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:44.000
Or they took one shot

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:46.000
Where he wasn't in each spot and just kept playing

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:48.000
Stop motion

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:50.000
They had to hold that camera

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:52.000
Real steady

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:54.000
Real steady

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:56.000
Hey, it's that time of the show where we get mad

02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:58.000
The FUs of the Week

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:16.000
Um

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:18.000
My FU of the Week goes to, uh, Dan not being here

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:20.000
Well, I mean

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:22.000
And I understand it was important to go to see his family

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:24.000
But still

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:26.000
It doesn't really stop me from being very lonely

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:28.000
Because he's been

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:30.000
You know, while he's not working and I wasn't working

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:32.000
I was used to having him here all day

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:34.000
And it was really nice

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:36.000
And now he's not there

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:38.000
And also I have to go back into the office tomorrow

02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:40.000
Because bitches didn't send me my, um

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:42.000
My letter about getting laid off

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:44.000
And I haven't been paid in two weeks

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:46.000
So you know what this means

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:48.000
If they don't fix it

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:50.000
I can collect interest

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:52.000
On my pay

02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:54.000
And if they don't get anything to me

02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:56.000
I'm going to the labor board

02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:58.000
Alert the media

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:00.000
Well, I could talk to the media too

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:02.000
I don't know how far I want to get into this

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:04.000
But I was looking at work at the news

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:06.000
And the latest things

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:08.000
I saw your work on the

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:10.000
Local news media site

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:12.000
About the closure

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:14.000
And see, I never got any memo that says

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:16.000
Don't talk about it

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:18.000
I'm not under NDA

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:20.000
Oh

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:22.000
Uh, Loki

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:24.000
I had some that I was

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:26.000
Really pissed off about earlier

02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:28.000
And I don't remember what it was

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:30.000
I'm going to go with my second

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:32.000
Thing that I'm pissed off at

02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:34.000
And that would be Apple

02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:36.000
And I'm pissed off at their customer service

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:38.000
It's good and terrible at the same time

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:40.000
The reps are nice

02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:42.000
The just simple

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:44.000
Logic stuff just doesn't seem to

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:46.000
Apply to them. For example

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:48.000
I purchased two iPod Touches

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:50.000
From them using an Apple gift card

02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:52.000
That I got from Sony

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:54.000
From my work for some sort of sales

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:56.000
Incentive thing

02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:58.000
I purchased it on the third

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:00.000
And they

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:02.000
According to the site

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:04.000
When I ordered it, it said it was going to be shipped

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:06.000
This week

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:08.000
Instead this week, they changed it

02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:10.000
And it's shipping next week

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:12.000
And you know

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:14.000
Meanwhile, the Apple store has tons of these

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:16.000
They have just a pile of them

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:18.000
Just sitting there

02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:20.000
So I called them up multiple times going

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:22.000
I need to cancel my order

02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:24.000
So that I can go purchase

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:26.000
Oh I'm sorry, even though we took off

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:28.000
The funds immediately out of your card

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:30.000
It's going to take us five to seven business days

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:32.000
To put it back on the card

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:34.000
Even though it's their own Apple card

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:36.000
I'm like, well okay fine, I don't really want to cancel

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:38.000
I just want to pick it up at the local store

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:40.000
Because they have them in stock

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:42.000
Oh no, I'm sorry you can't do that

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:44.000
Because our systems are separate

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:46.000
So that's retarded

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:48.000
It finally shipped though on Friday

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:50.000
FROM CANADA

02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:52.000
Why the fuck are you shipping something

02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:54.000
From Canada to the United States

02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:56.000
I'm sure you have a fucking plant

02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:58.000
In the US that you can ship these from

02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:00.000
But no, let's pick a really far away

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:02.000
Place to ship it from

02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:04.000
Just to piss me off even more

02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:06.000
I wouldn't have these, that fucking gift card

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:08.000
I wouldn't be buying your stupid iPods

02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:10.000
But I am

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:12.000
Like I'm fucking going to buy an ITV

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:14.000
Or an iMac, no way

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:16.000
We're part of Canada

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:18.000
I don't know

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:20.000
I'm not familiar with Canada

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:22.000
I can look that up real quick while you do your FUs

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:24.000
I will, my FU

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:26.000
Goes to myself

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:28.000
Because I've managed to put a scratch on my brand new car

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:30.000
After having it for only about

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:32.000
Two and a half months

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:34.000
I'm going to park

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:36.000
Don't worry, I didn't hit another car

02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:38.000
Refrain from making fun of me

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:40.000
Because I will destroy you

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:42.000
I scratched the car parking in Alan's garage

02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:44.000
Because

02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:46.000
It's big city garages

02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:48.000
And they're very tight fits

02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:50.000
In the big cities

02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:52.000
As opposed to what I'm used to dealing with in Sacramento

02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:54.000
Where it's like giant four car garages

02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:56.000
Yeah, I got a big old scratch in the car now

02:21:56.000 --> 02:21:58.000
And I'm kind of upset about it

02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:00.000
My mistake, it's not Canada

02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:02.000
Even further away

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:04.000
Because there's no Shanghai, Canada

02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:06.000
It's China

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:08.000
They're shipping it from China

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:10.000
Yeah, let's pick the furthest place

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:12.000
From my location to ship this from

02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:14.000
That's probably where the damn thing's made

02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:16.000
I like that, that's awesome

02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:18.000
And by the way, because Apple's so wonderful

02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:20.000
And you know, in saving their costs

02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:22.000
They ship them separate

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:24.000
The two items are actually separate

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:26.000
Thank you

02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:28.000
Thank you for doing all that wonderful stuff for me

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:30.000
Why are you mad though?

02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:35.000
Hey, more news, happy happy

02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:37.000
And then the Skype line's coming at you

02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:39.000
1877 Game OLR, not just yet

02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:41.000
I'll let you know when

02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:43.000
Yes, um

02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:45.000
So there's a brand new

02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:47.000
Overclock remix album

02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:49.000
That's coming out, you may remember the last one

02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:51.000
Was a remix album from Final Fantasy 7

02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:53.000
This time it's going to be

02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:56.000
A five part Final Fantasy 5 compilation

02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:58.000
Oh I get it

02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:00.000
Five parts, because it's five

02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:02.000
Ha

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:04.000
It's called the Final Fantasy 5

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:06.000
The Fabled Warriors

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:08.000
An overclocked remix five part album series

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:10.000
And um

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:12.000
It is free

02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:14.000
Which is the best price

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:16.000
And the first part of the five

02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:18.000
Is actually out now

02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:20.000
So you can go check it out

02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:22.000
And if you want to download that

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:24.000
Go to

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:26.000
wcremix.org

02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:30.000
Alright

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:34.000
One more story for you guys, then we're going to open up the

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:36.000
Skype line at 877 Game OLR

02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:38.000
Our username on Skype

02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:40.000
OrangeLoungeRadio

02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:42.000
Being asked in chat from floppy discourse

02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:44.000
What about Google Talk? Doesn't Google Talk let you call

02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:46.000
877 numbers now?

02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:48.000
Like you can call numbers in the US and Canada?

02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:50.000
You can actually call numbers?

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:52.000
That's what I heard, yeah

02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:54.000
I'll keep my phone with Google

02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:56.000
Talk once I get

02:23:56.000 --> 02:23:58.000
I was going to get a prepaid phone

02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:00.000
Through like AT&T or something

02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:02.000
Like that

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:04.000
But I don't like AT&T

02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:06.000
Because they're like, oh by the way there's all these fees

02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:08.000
We add on top of that

02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:10.000
Because I only would use like 12 minutes a month

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:12.000
And I'd use their 25 cent

02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:14.000
Per minute plan or something like that

02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:16.000
But then they're like, oh we're going to add another dollar fee

02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:18.000
On there, oh and there's taxes, oh and there's this

02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:22.000
Oh and there's a convenience fee

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:24.000
So I'll just go through Virgin

02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:26.000
Alright, one more story

02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:28.000
For you guys, do you know the name

02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:30.000
Chiaki Kuriyama?

02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:32.000
I hope you do

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:34.000
Yeah I know the name

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:36.000
She was in Kill Bill

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:38.000
And she was in Battle Royale

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:40.000
Correct

02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:42.000
She was Gogo Yubari in Kill Bill

02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:44.000
And then she was

02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:46.000
I don't remember the character's name

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:48.000
She was in Battle Royale

02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:50.000
She was in both of those movies

02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:52.000
She was

02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:54.000
Not cock puncher

02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:56.000
She will soon be taking the role of

02:24:56.000 --> 02:24:58.000
Misuzu Asaki

02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:00.000
It's going to be the heroine of the new

02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:02.000
Yakuza game

02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:06.000
That's right, it's Yakuza Ryugagotoku of the End

02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:08.000
That's right, Sega revealed this week

02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:10.000
To IGN the fact that she is in the game

02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:12.000
There's going to be some images

02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:14.000
Compared here where you can actually

02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:16.000
See that the character in the game

02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:18.000
Looks like her too, which is kind of freaky

02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:20.000
She's a very pretty girl

02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:22.000
And the character looks like her

02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:24.000
Characters in other movies, very reminiscent

02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:26.000
Of Gogo Yubari

02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:28.000
So there it is, very cool

02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:30.000
There's some other characters in the game as well

02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:32.000
But no worry about who the voice actors are

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:34.000
There will be lots and lots and lots of more

02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:36.000
Information at the Tokyo Game Show

02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:38.000
This actress does not

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:40.000
Really act or speak in English

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:42.000
As far as I know

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:44.000
She doesn't play Japanese exclusive roles

02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:46.000
So don't expect this voice acting to come over to the US

02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:48.000
But for those of you guys that are really into

02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:50.000
The Yakuza series, like I know

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:52.000
Deakman, who does our website, loves these games

02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:54.000
Probably will import it on Playstation 3

02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:56.000
Thanks to the region free stuff

02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:58.000
Can look forward to hearing her lovely voice

02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:00.000
As the heroine in that game

02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:02.000
Very cool

02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:04.000
Skypline is now open 1877 Game OLR

02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:06.000
Or our username on Skype

02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:08.000
Is OrangeLoungeRadio

02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:10.000
We're already getting calls, you ready for this?

02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:12.000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio

02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:14.000
Who's this?

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:16.000
Hey, this is DJ Blaziken

02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:18.000
DJ Blaziken, what's on your mind?

02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:20.000
Not much

02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:22.000
Other than I got a little bit

02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:24.000
Of a similar situation

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:26.000
That Loki kind of discussed

02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:28.000
A while back

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:30.000
On an episode how he's

02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:32.000
Trying to stray away from the three-fret

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:34.000
Formation

02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:36.000
Because he was a converger

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:38.000
From guitar freaks to guitar hero

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:40.000
Well, let's just say here

02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:42.000
I had the same excuse

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:44.000
When I started playing guitar hero

02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:46.000
I'm like

02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:48.000
I cannot play medium, there's four notes

02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:50.000
There should only be three

02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:52.000
Aw, it wasn't that hard

02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:54.000
It wasn't that hard

02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:56.000
All it takes is

02:26:56.000 --> 02:26:58.000
Loki, one word

02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:00.000
Practice

02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:02.000
That's right, practice

02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:04.000
Yeah, but that also takes time

02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:06.000
And time I'm not willing to spend on that

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:08.000
Okay

02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:10.000
I will say though, I recently

02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:12.000
Downloaded and played the

02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:14.000
DJ Hero 2 demo

02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:16.000
Oh, I forgot that's out

02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:18.000
I did half that

02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:20.000
You know what, those bastards didn't put it on PlayStation Network

02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:22.000
And my controller and gamer

02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:24.000
For PlayStation Network

02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:26.000
It's exclusive to Xbox 360

02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:28.000
Because we're Activision

02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:30.000
And we suck

02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:32.000
Well, okay

02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:34.000
I will say though, it is pretty cool

02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:36.000
On the factor

02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:38.000
Now they have the DJ battle mode

02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:40.000
Which is basically

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:42.000
Okay, if you remember just

02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:44.000
Normal space off in Guitar Hero

02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:46.000
It's basically what this is for DJ Hero

02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:48.000
It's cool it is

02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:50.000
So, like, you do one part

02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:52.000
And then your player does another part

02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:54.000
And he goes back and forth

02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:56.000
I'm still wondering though if they're gonna do

02:27:56.000 --> 02:27:58.000
And I forgot to ask him when he was there

02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:00.000
If they're gonna do the guitar here

02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:02.000
Or the guitar DJ stuff again

02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:04.000
I remember how they had that

02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:06.000
By what I was seeing on the demo

02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:08.000
There wasn't anything for guitar and DJ

02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:10.000
It was mostly the vocals

02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:12.000
And DJ stuff

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:14.000
And my father kind of found

02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:16.000
It kind of weird that I was singing

02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:18.000
The song, Don'tcha

02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:20.000
The Doncha remix

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:22.000
And then the Lady Gaga remix

02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:24.000
It would have been cool though

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:26.000
If they did that because they could have had vocals

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:28.000
And they could have had guitars

02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:30.000
And then a DJ or something

02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:32.000
Man, that would be great

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:34.000
For Loki to get that on YouTube

02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:36.000
Doing a Doncha

02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:38.000
You know what they really should have done

02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:40.000
But I'm sure they don't want to affect their

02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:42.000
DJ Hero sales

02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:44.000
You know how Rock Band 3

02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:46.000
Added keyboards have the next

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:48.000
Guitar Hero game add turntables

02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:50.000
To the actual rock stuff

02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:54.000
How many songs really support that though?

02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:56.000
Not many, but it would be kind of neat though

02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:58.000
As in a little added download content

02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:00.000
How many songs support a guitar in DJ Hero?

02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:02.000
Not a lot, but it was pretty cool

02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:04.000
The ones that did

02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:06.000
And actually, do you know what

02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:08.000
Of all the weird things

02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:10.000
You know how you guys were talking about

02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:12.000
Learning the actual dance moves

02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:14.000
From Dance Central and whatnot

02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:16.000
Well, of all the weird things

02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:18.000
One of my

02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:20.000
One of my friends

02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:22.000
Went to a Macy's store and actually

02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:24.000
Went and tried out

02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:26.000
A thing with Dance Central

02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:28.000
And he showed me some of the moves

02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:30.000
To Lady Gaga's Poker Face

02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:32.000
And let's just say

02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:34.000
Here

02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:36.000
I think it was that or Just Dance that came on

02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:38.000
At Homecoming

02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:40.000
And we were actually pulling off

02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:42.000
The actual dance moves from the music video

02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:44.000
And

02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:46.000
Let's just say here, we were

02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:48.000
Getting questions asked, like

02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:50.000
How do you know the moves from the video?

02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:52.000
And you both got laid, right?

02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:54.000
Huh?

02:29:54.000 --> 02:29:56.000
Nothing

02:29:56.000 --> 02:29:58.000
Basically, our answer was

02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:00.000
We learned them from a video game

02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:02.000
And people just gave us a weird eye

02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:04.000
And it was the same thing

02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:06.000
It was the same thing we were doing

02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:08.000
Next time you need to say

02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:10.000
Private lessons

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:12.000
Private lessons is your answer next time

02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:14.000
You know, it's not

02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:16.000
I mean, cause see a game like

02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:18.000
Even Just Dance, actually

02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:20.000
It's not, you know

02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:22.000
It shows you dance moves

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:24.000
I would go repeating

02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:26.000
What was in there. Okay, let me play this way, Rob

02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:28.000
And this is just gonna make you want YouTube videos

02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:30.000
Of this even more

02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:32.000
I had, I picked some songs

02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:34.000
To play, you know, like I did

02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:36.000
Junior Seniors

02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:38.000
Move Your Feet, that was fun

02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:40.000
Um

02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:42.000
Wait, in Dance Central? No, not Dance Central

02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:44.000
In Just Dance 2

02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:46.000
I know that song

02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:48.000
From DDR Extreme back on the Playstation 2

02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:50.000
Which, that was the last

02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:52.000
Good one

02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:54.000
That was one of our first songs retired from the

02:30:54.000 --> 02:30:56.000
Cage match because the video was so awesome

02:30:56.000 --> 02:30:58.000
It is awesome

02:30:58.000 --> 02:31:00.000
Um, there's a song on there, I don't remember which

02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:02.000
Artist it is, but they have like a Tron guy

02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:04.000
Dancing in the background of

02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:06.000
Just Dance 2, but anyways

02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:08.000
As I was gonna say, I got to pick some songs

02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:10.000
And then the Ubisoft ref, she got to pick

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:12.000
Some songs, and unfortunately she picked

02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:14.000
It's Raining Men

02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:16.000
So there is a video out there of me

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:18.000
Trying to beat her

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:20.000
At, you know, I was

02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:22.000
Trying to be more fabulous than she was

02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:24.000
I guess, at that

02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:26.000
But I got close, I did not beat

02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:28.000
Her though at that song, and thank god

02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:30.000
Because that would have been the only song that I actually beat her in

02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:32.000
And that would not be good either

02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:34.000
Sorry, I just need to hear a little bit of this song here

02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:46.000
This song is pretty amazing

02:31:46.000 --> 02:31:48.000
Too bad this band never really went anywhere

02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:50.000
But this song

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:52.000
Hey, um, by the way

02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:54.000
Uh, on the factor, okay

02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:56.000
I figured out a way to sort of

02:31:56.000 --> 02:31:58.000
Try to play Guitar Hero Rock Band

02:31:58.000 --> 02:32:00.000
And, um, what else

02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:02.000
Rock Revolution

02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:04.000
To make the guitar point like guitar freaks

02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:06.000
In other words, all I've had to do

02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:08.000
Is flip my miniature

02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:10.000
Monitor like it's a 9 incher monitor

02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:12.000
Upside down

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:14.000
Flip it to lefty mode

02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:16.000
And

02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:18.000
That's how I've been able to make it play like guitar freaks almost

02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:20.000
That is a lot of effort

02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:22.000
For such a little reward

02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:24.000
But hey, whatever makes you happy, dude

02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:26.000
Alright

02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:28.000
We gotta let you go to get some more calls, dude

02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:30.000
I'm sorry, I gotta cut you off

02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:32.000
Because we gotta get some more calls

02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:34.000
But thank you so much

02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:36.000
Hurry it up

02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:38.000
We actually did some DDR moves

02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:40.000
To, I think it was, um

02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:42.000
My Sharona

02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:44.000
Let's just say here, one or two

02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:46.000
Guys who said they might have heard your show

02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:48.000
Back in the day

02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:50.000
We should have been on Step Squad years ago

02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:52.000
Since you've been at DDR tournaments

02:32:54.000 --> 02:32:56.000
We've been watching a bunch of Mel B dance

02:32:56.000 --> 02:32:58.000
Videos from tournaments

02:32:58.000 --> 02:33:00.000
Ah, alright

02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:02.000
Well, next time take an orange bat

02:33:02.000 --> 02:33:04.000
To prom, that's all I'm saying

02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:06.000
If you really want to represent the show

02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:08.000
Later

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:10.000
1-877-GAME-OL-R

02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:12.000
If you wanna give us a call

02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:14.000
Or Orange Lawns Radio on Skype

02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:16.000
If you wanna give us a call that way, like this person is

02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:18.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio, who's this?

02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:20.000
Hey, it's Ronma, what's up everyone

02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:22.000
Hey, Ronma, what's up?

02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:24.000
Not much, um

02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:26.000
To answer what you said about the Texas Instrument calculators

02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:28.000
Yeah, they're still making them

02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:30.000
And multiple models and flavors

02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:32.000
I just would have thought that, like

02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:34.000
They were on, like, model, like

02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:36.000
90-100 by now, you know what I mean?

02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:38.000
Like, instead of 82

02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:40.000
Well, my roommate has a TI-85

02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:42.000
But they don't make that one anymore

02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:44.000
From what I remember

02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:46.000
This is from, like, a few months ago

02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:48.000
They still make the 83, the 84

02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:50.000
84 Plus

02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:52.000
84 Plus Silver, the 89

02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:54.000
And one called the Nspire

02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:56.000
One size a scientific calculator

02:33:56.000 --> 02:33:58.000
You pull the keyboard out and you flip it over

02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:00.000
It's like a mini computer

02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:02.000
That sounds like a sidekick or something, that's crazy

02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:04.000
And yeah, that thing's like

02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:06.000
200 bucks, and around this time

02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:08.000
In the year, the parents come in

02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:10.000
With the, um, with the list of

02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:12.000
Stuff that the kids need, and if they're taking

02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:14.000
Entry-level algebra math

02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:16.000
They're told that they need a

02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:18.000
TI calculator

02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:20.000
Now, who remembers the TI-99-4A?

02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:22.000
Anyone remember that?

02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:24.000
I had that

02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:26.000
That was a computer in the 1980s, the TI-99

02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:28.000
I had that

02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:30.000
With the big cartridge thing on the side

02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:32.000
Oh yeah, the big ol' cartridge slot that went on the side

02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:34.000
I have played so many games on that

02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:36.000
There's something that I need to find

02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:38.000
You want to get a TI-99

02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:40.000
Just for the heck of it?

02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:42.000
Just so you can play, like, Texas Invaders

02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:44.000
Wow

02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:46.000
Would that be Mexicans?

02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:48.000
No, it's a

02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:50.000
Space Invaders rip-off

02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:52.000
You dingbat

02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:54.000
Alright, I'm sorry, that'd be Arizona Invaders

02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:56.000
Stop it

02:34:56.000 --> 02:34:58.000
Alright

02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:00.000
Well, thank you for the

02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:02.000
Update on calculators

02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:04.000
Glory to tell

02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:06.000
Alright, make it quick

02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:08.000
I was playing Scott Pilgrim vs. the World

02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:10.000
A couple of weeks ago

02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:12.000
And I was checking my scores on the leaderboards

02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:14.000
And I'm going to post a link in the chatroom

02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:16.000
Of a Twitpig, because this makes for great radio

02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:18.000
Now, the funny thing is

02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:20.000
If you look at it, I'm ranked

02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:22.000
Above someone called

02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:24.000
I'm a greedy Jew

02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:26.000
And I found it

02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:28.000
Slightly offensive

02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:30.000
So someone's game tag is I'm a greedy Jew

02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:32.000
Just to be fair, though, you're two slots

02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:34.000
Above I'm a greedy Jew, actually

02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:36.000
Two slots, yeah

02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:38.000
You're under

02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:40.000
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, you're five slots

02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:42.000
Under Yapathy

02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:46.000
I just find it

02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:48.000
Funny that when I first got Rock Band

02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:50.000
I went and I created my band

02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:52.000
Which was my roommate's idea, which was called

02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:54.000
Rhythm in Jews

02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:56.000
When I put it in, it said

02:35:56.000 --> 02:35:58.000
And I quote

02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:00.000
Jews are banned on Xbox Live

02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:02.000
I think that was

02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:04.000
A programming issue

02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:06.000
I had to go and change the

02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:08.000
E to a 3

02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:10.000
Way so I can get on and play

02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:12.000
Well

02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:14.000
Did you report the name for being offensive?

02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:16.000
Because I'm thinking, you know, call

02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:18.000
Me crazy, but if Mount

02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:20.000
Gay or whatever, no, Fort Gay

02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:22.000
West Virginia is going to get banned

02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:24.000
I have a feeling I'm a greedy

02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:26.000
Jew might be

02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:28.000
Slightly offensive, and I don't think that's

02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:30.000
A town in, like, South Carolina or

02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:32.000
Anything, I'm pretty sure that guy's just

02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:34.000
A douchebag

02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:36.000
And I've seen a couple more names like that, so I popped

02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:38.000
In Rock Band 2, flipped the

02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:40.000
3 back to an E, and I had

02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:42.000
No problem going on live

02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:46.000
Whatever makes you happy

02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:48.000
I'm just amused by it, that's all

02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:50.000
It just amuses

02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:52.000
Me, that's all it is

02:36:52.000 --> 02:36:54.000
Alright, well I have to

02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:56.000
Now that we have one sitting in studio

02:36:56.000 --> 02:36:58.000
I have to ask the official Jew of Orange Lawn

02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:00.000
Radio Dark Sakura, are you offended by the

02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:02.000
Name I'm a Greedy Jew

02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:04.000
On Xbox Live?

02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:06.000
I don't really

02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:08.000
Get offended, I think, by other people, really

02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:10.000
Because they're the ones who are stupid and

02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:12.000
Ignorant, and I'm not

02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:14.000
However, he could very likely

02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:16.000
Just admit all the, you know

02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:18.000
Perhaps he

02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:20.000
Admits that he's Jewish

02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:22.000
And happens to be a bit greedy

02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:24.000
That could be

02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:26.000
Maybe it's really SSJ-100 Matt

02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:28.000
However

02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:30.000
You called him into the show just to make that

02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:32.000
Joke, didn't you?

02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:34.000
Kinda, sorta

02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:36.000
However

02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:42.000
I mean

02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:46.000
I just have a hard time

02:37:46.000 --> 02:37:48.000
About being offended by other people's

02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:50.000
Ignorance

02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:52.000
They're just, they're poop

02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:54.000
They're being poopy

02:37:54.000 --> 02:37:56.000
Why is that person worth my time?

02:37:56.000 --> 02:37:58.000
You know

02:37:58.000 --> 02:38:00.000
I think

02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:02.000
It's a symptom

02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:04.000
Of society

02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:06.000
And it's not, I don't think

02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:08.000
It's funny

02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:10.000
I don't think it's funny at all

02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:12.000
And I'm sure it is intended to be

02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:14.000
Offensive

02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:16.000
But I would rather just not give them

02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:18.000
The satisfaction of being offended

02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:20.000
That's me

02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:22.000
Alright

02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:24.000
Well, Rama, any other offensive things you wanna

02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:26.000
Bring to the attention of our little program?

02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:28.000
Baba Booey, Baba Booey

02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:30.000
Howard Stern

02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:32.000
Bye, Rama

02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:36.000
1877 Game OLR

02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:38.000
Or our username on Skype is

02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:40.000
OrangeLoungeRadio if you care to venture that way

02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:42.000
We're taking your calls

02:38:42.000 --> 02:38:44.000
Live as we tape our show on this

02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:46.000
Lovely Sunday evening

02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:48.000
Hot and ready to go

02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:50.000
What? No

02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:52.000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio

02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:54.000
Clearly, hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio

02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:56.000
Who's this?

02:38:56.000 --> 02:38:58.000
Hey, can you guys hear me?

02:38:58.000 --> 02:39:00.000
Yes we can, hi

02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:02.000
Hi, this is DDR Dollar Bill

02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:04.000
DDR Dollar Bill, what's on your mind?

02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:06.000
Not that much

02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:08.000
Two things, just real quick

02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:10.000
That shows that hell is freezing over

02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:12.000
First, I'm actually getting Halo Reach

02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:14.000
Oh my gosh, Halo Reach around

02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:16.000
For it?

02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:18.000
Somewhat, only because it's the last game

02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:20.000
In the series apparently

02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:22.000
And I'm getting a $20 gift card from Best Buy

02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:24.000
So why not?

02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:26.000
Nice

02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:28.000
Yeah, just pretty much all the reasons

02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:30.000
I mean, I gotta multiplayer and end up cursing everybody out

02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:32.000
As usual

02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:34.000
But that's just the first sign

02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:36.000
And the second sign which is very

02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:38.000
I'm gonna ask everybody here for help is

02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:40.000
I'm also getting a Playstation 3

02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:42.000
By Christmas this year

02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:44.000
And the thing is

02:39:44.000 --> 02:39:46.000
The only really big condition is

02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:48.000
I need to get more games that are not

02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:50.000
That everybody can play

02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:52.000
Not just myself

02:39:52.000 --> 02:39:54.000
Like party games

02:39:54.000 --> 02:39:56.000
You could say that

02:39:56.000 --> 02:39:58.000
Games are not like

02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:00.000
What about the Playstation move?

02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:02.000
I mean, it's just gonna be a bunch of wee party

02:40:02.000 --> 02:40:04.000
games on the move, any interest in that?

02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:06.000
Well, actually that

02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:08.000
Is the reason I'm getting it, first off

02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:10.000
For the move

02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:12.000
There you go right there

02:40:12.000 --> 02:40:14.000
Yeah

02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:16.000
I was just thinking

02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:18.000
I was just thinking more games

02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:20.000
Than just the move games

02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:22.000
You know, something else

02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:24.000
The SingStar franchise is always a good

02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:26.000
Party starter, that's really popular at parties

02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:28.000
Because it's like karaoke, one of the

02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:30.000
Karaoke games, it's a little different from

02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:32.000
Rock Band in those games because A, it's exclusively

02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:34.000
Singing and lets you do duets and stuff

02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:36.000
And B, it actually shows the actual music videos

02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:38.000
In the background, which I think is kind of a nice

02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:40.000
Touch, especially for people that aren't as familiar

02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:42.000
With video games, it's like, suddenly you have a

02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:44.000
Karaoke bar in your house, so that's all

02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:46.000
Interesting, you know, in that regard, those are

02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:48.000
Always fun games, what else?

02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:50.000
Fun party games on the

02:40:50.000 --> 02:40:52.000
Playstation 3 or multiplayer

02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:54.000
Events, Little Big Planet

02:40:54.000 --> 02:40:56.000
Absolutely, is a Playstation 3

02:40:56.000 --> 02:40:58.000
Exclusive, up to four people can play that game

02:40:58.000 --> 02:41:00.000
At once, online or in the same house

02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:02.000
Modulation Racers, oh that's a good one too

02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:04.000
That's a good one for multiplayer, can you

02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:06.000
Do, does it have split screens, you can do that all?

02:41:06.000 --> 02:41:08.000
I believe it does

02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:10.000
Nice, very nice

02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:12.000
What are the fun little party games?

02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:14.000
Blur, I don't know

02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:16.000
I'm trying to think of things that are exclusive

02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:18.000
Because you said you had a 360, right?

02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:20.000
There is Buzz

02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:22.000
Oh, Buzz is

02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:24.000
Very popular for parties, that's the game

02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:26.000
Showy game, when it comes to the special

02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:28.000
Controllers that are just like the A, B, C and D

02:41:28.000 --> 02:41:30.000
Answers, and people who write their own

02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:32.000
Questions and everything, that is a big

02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:34.000
Big party game, for multiplayer

02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:36.000
You can write in your own questions?

02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:38.000
Yes you can, that's what I hear

02:41:38.000 --> 02:41:40.000
Yeah, I know right

02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:42.000
Apparently they, I don't

02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:44.000
Know if you can straight up

02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:46.000
Do your, I don't have the game personally, I don't know

02:41:46.000 --> 02:41:48.000
If you can straight up do your own questions and play

02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:50.000
A game locally with those questions you wrote

02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:52.000
But I know like people are able to submit

02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:54.000
Questions to like official question packs

02:41:54.000 --> 02:41:56.000
And things, I've heard of this, I don't

02:41:56.000 --> 02:41:58.000
Know, again I don't own the game myself

02:41:58.000 --> 02:42:00.000
So I'm not sure of all the details and how it works

02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:02.000
All my own questions? That'd be great

02:42:02.000 --> 02:42:04.000
Like an OLR trivia pack

02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:06.000
Would anyone play that? I don't know

02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:08.000
Alright, so I guess those are our

02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:10.000
Suggestions, so let us know what you end

02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:12.000
Up buying and if you have fun with it

02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:14.000
I definitely will guys

02:42:14.000 --> 02:42:16.000
Alright, well have fun with PlayStation 3

02:42:16.000 --> 02:42:18.000
Keep on gaming

02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:20.000
And we'll talk to you later, okay?

02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:22.000
Alright, be good guys

02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:24.000
Later, we'll try

02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:26.000
That's gonna do it for the Skype line tonight

02:42:26.000 --> 02:42:28.000
Sorry for those guys that didn't get through, but be sure to

02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:30.000
Always leave us an email

02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:32.000
OrangeLoungeRadio.com or

02:42:32.000 --> 02:42:34.000
Our Twitter, Twitter.com slash OLR

02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:36.000
And so forth

02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:38.000
Loki, do you have any last minute stories you want to get to tonight?

02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:40.000
It's not a lot tonight

02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:42.000
One is that there's a rumor

02:42:42.000 --> 02:42:44.000
That the Nintendo DS, or not the DS

02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:46.000
The 3DS will be out

02:42:46.000 --> 02:42:48.000
In Japan in November

02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:50.000
This is coming from a company called

02:42:50.000 --> 02:42:52.000
Keys Factory

02:42:52.000 --> 02:42:54.000
Yeah, Keys Factory, they design

02:42:54.000 --> 02:42:56.000
A bunch of DS,

02:42:56.000 --> 02:42:58.000
DSi, DSi, XL

02:42:58.000 --> 02:43:00.000
Peripherals

02:43:00.000 --> 02:43:02.000
And apparently this is coming from

02:43:02.000 --> 02:43:04.000
Their Twitter

02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:06.000
And it was saying that

02:43:08.000 --> 02:43:10.000
Let's see here

02:43:10.000 --> 02:43:12.000
It was saying November 20th is when they're expecting

02:43:12.000 --> 02:43:14.000
The system out

02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:16.000
So

02:43:16.000 --> 02:43:18.000
That's interesting, it says on November 20th

02:43:18.000 --> 02:43:20.000
11 3DS

02:43:20.000 --> 02:43:22.000
Products that we designed to go on sale

02:43:22.000 --> 02:43:24.000
All at once, people who are buying 3DS

02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:26.000
Buy it at the same time

02:43:26.000 --> 02:43:28.000
There'll be more details on our homepage

02:43:28.000 --> 02:43:30.000
So

02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:32.000
It's interesting, maybe they'll announce that

02:43:32.000 --> 02:43:34.000
At Tokyo Game Show, since it's right around the corner

02:43:34.000 --> 02:43:36.000
Actually no, I don't think

02:43:36.000 --> 02:43:38.000
They actually are at Tokyo Game Show

02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:40.000
Well, maybe around the same time

02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:42.000
They usually do their own Nintendo thing

02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:44.000
So that's that

02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:46.000
And then Knights in the Nightmare

02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:48.000
A game that was originally out on the Nintendo DS

02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:50.000
From Atlus

02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:52.000
It's coming to the PSP

02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:54.000
And kind of as an added bonus

02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:56.000
They are going to be giving you

02:43:56.000 --> 02:43:58.000
A copy, a digital copy that is

02:43:58.000 --> 02:44:00.000
Of, and I cannot

02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:02.000
Pronounce this, but we're going to try

02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:04.000
Looks like

02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:06.000
Yggdras

02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:08.000
Union, I guess

02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:10.000
Y-G-G-D-R-A

02:44:10.000 --> 02:44:12.000
And

02:44:12.000 --> 02:44:14.000
That's going to be in every

02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:16.000
Copy, every launch copy of

02:44:16.000 --> 02:44:18.000
Knights in the Nightmare, but knowing

02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:20.000
Atlus, that will be all the copies of

02:44:20.000 --> 02:44:22.000
Knights in the Nightmare on PSP

02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:24.000
They're scheduled to come out

02:44:24.000 --> 02:44:26.000
November 9th

02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:28.000
So that's kind of cool

02:44:28.000 --> 02:44:30.000
And

02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:32.000
That'd be it

02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:34.000
Wow, this is kind of slow on the last minute

02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:36.000
Yeah, it's pretty, pretty dead

02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:38.000
Alright

02:44:38.000 --> 02:44:40.000
Well, that's going to do it for this week's episode

02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:42.000
Of Orange Lounge Radio, but not before we get around

02:44:42.000 --> 02:44:44.000
And get everybody's final thought

02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:46.000
Uh, DarkSakura, do you have a final thought tonight?

02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:48.000
Suebooks!

02:44:48.000 --> 02:44:50.000
Can we please make that the fortune cookie message tonight?

02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:52.000
I don't know what you had picked, but

02:44:52.000 --> 02:44:54.000
Okay, okay, okay

02:44:54.000 --> 02:44:56.000
Alright, thank you

02:44:56.000 --> 02:44:58.000
Let me pick one once in a while

02:44:58.000 --> 02:45:00.000
I had Lewis Black, so

02:45:00.000 --> 02:45:02.000
We'll roll him over to next week, you won't mind

02:45:02.000 --> 02:45:04.000
Alright

02:45:04.000 --> 02:45:06.000
Loki, your final thought tonight?

02:45:06.000 --> 02:45:08.000
I don't catch that reference

02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:10.000
You will soon

02:45:10.000 --> 02:45:12.000
Is that it for your final

02:45:12.000 --> 02:45:14.000
I don't get it

02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:16.000
Hopefully I'll have a connect in

02:45:16.000 --> 02:45:18.000
Two weeks

02:45:18.000 --> 02:45:20.000
Alright

02:45:20.000 --> 02:45:22.000
Cross my fingers

02:45:22.000 --> 02:45:24.000
My final thought is

02:45:24.000 --> 02:45:26.000
I don't know

02:45:26.000 --> 02:45:28.000
Hi, that's my final thought

02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:30.000
I don't know

02:45:30.000 --> 02:45:32.000
Bye, that's my final thought

02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:34.000
Bye, have a great week everybody

02:45:34.000 --> 02:45:36.000
We'll see you next time here at Orange Lounge Radio

Live promptly at 6 o'clock next week

02:45:40.000 --> 02:45:42.000
Bobby is not on next week

02:45:42.000 --> 02:45:44.000
But we will still be here on September the 19th

02:45:44.000 --> 02:45:46.000
