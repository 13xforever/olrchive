Hello my friends out there on the internet

And welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
We are that show dedicated to video games

00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
How are you?

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Orange Lounge Foodio going on over there

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I slept most of the day

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Awesome, Orange Lounge Nappio

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I took an awesome nap yesterday actually

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
And that's how I was able to stay up late

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Because I went clubbing and I was able to stay up until like 2am

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
It was fun

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It sounds like you had a good time

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I had a great time

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm just very proud of myself because I used the cucumber that I grew myself

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
And I made myself some salad and it's fantastic

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Soon you're going to be moving into a commune

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
And starting your own

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Okay

32
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I have five plants that I'm growing in the backyard

33
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
And three of them are like stuff to season with

34
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Remember the fort?

35
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The fort?

36
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The fort

37
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
It was, oh this was years ago in OLR history

38
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
This was probably around like

39
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
When DDR Angel first started coming to the show

40
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Probably around like episode like 30-ish right

41
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
And she had a friend

42
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
And I can't remember the dude's name

43
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm a horrible, well I remember his real name

44
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I don't want to say it on the show

45
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It was D-U

46
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Yeah

47
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Yeah okay

48
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I think I remember because

49
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Right?

50
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
But he lived out in the middle of nowhere right

51
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
And to get to his house

52
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
He had to go by this place in the middle of nowhere

53
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
With all these signs that were like keep out

54
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
And trespassers will be shot on sight

55
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
And it just looked like some dude

56
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Has had himself holed up in there since the 60s

57
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
And we decided to call that the OLR fort

58
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Oh yeah

59
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And that's who we're all going to move into remember

60
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I remember

61
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
The fort

62
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Oh

63
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I can't remember all this stuff

64
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Oh good times

65
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Your brain works better than mine does today

66
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
That's alright

67
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Say hello to the one and only tech master Loki

68
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Hello

69
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
How are you?

70
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Hi

71
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Happy birthday Loki

72
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Thank you

73
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Is your mic on?

74
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I don't know if we're even hearing you

75
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It is on

76
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It is on but for some reason we are not hearing you at all

77
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I screwed with the volume

78
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I don't think we screwed with it at all

79
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Are you guys hearing Loki?

80
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I have the crappy mic

81
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I don't know what's going on here

82
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Live radio and I'm not sure

83
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I guess we are hearing Loki

84
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
He's just not as loud as the others

85
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
No I'm not even sure

86
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
No you're not on at all

87
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
That's oh you know what

88
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Good ol'

89
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Ah they plugged me in the wrong hole

90
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
There you go

91
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Hi Loki

92
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
See this is what happens when you put it in the wrong hole okay

93
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Let's try that again

94
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
And the one and only tech master Loki

95
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Hello

96
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Hi how are you doing?

97
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'm tired

98
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I plugged it in the out hole

99
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Oops

100
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
That's what happens

101
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Well happy birthday a little late

102
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Thank you

103
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
That's right

104
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Never forget September 11th Loki's birthday

105
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
No I'm being a little bit silly

106
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
You don't have any tragedies on your birthday do you?

107
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Ah no but I do have a victory

108
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
My birthday

109
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
There's two reasons my birthday rocks

110
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
One it's the day that Strom Thurmond died

111
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
And B it's the day that sodomy laws were overturned in Texas

112
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
That's what I get on my birthday

113
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
See my birthday was the Waco thing

114
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Oh was it?

115
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Yeah

116
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Oh no no tragedies on my birthday yet

117
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Just victories

118
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Bitch

119
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
So talking about something funny made out of tragedy I guess

120
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
There's this pet and feed store that's near my house or whatever

121
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
And they have this horse statue that's out in front of

122
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Like a full size horse statue that's out in front of their building

123
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And they dress it up you know to

124
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
For like Halloween or you know St. Paddy's Day

125
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
All the different stuff they dress it up themed like that

126
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
So they decided hey we're gonna dress it up for 9-11

127
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:20,000
And so this horse has a replica of the twin towers on its back

128
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
And it's like

129
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
That almost sounds tacky

130
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It is extremely tacky

131
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I get wanting to be patriotic

132
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
And I do think they kind of should make a day out of 9-11 as a remembrance

133
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
And a day to kind of celebrate all things American

134
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Although I realize it's also like the 4th of July as it is

135
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
But you know what I mean

136
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Like it's too bad that that had to happen on your birthday

137
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
But it's just you know some people are born on Christmas

138
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Some people are born on you know the day sodomy laws are repealed

139
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Some people are born on 9-11

140
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
And you know it's just a birthday

141
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Yeah what can you do

142
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
At least if you're born on Easter you don't always have to have it again on Easter

143
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
True or if you're born February 29th you get to stay young for a very long time

144
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Even though you look really old for your age

145
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Yes

146
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Alright anyhow

147
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Let's start I guess with a little bit of How's Your Gaming Week

148
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Oh I should say about the marathon

149
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I want to thank the listeners first off

150
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
The marathon was awesome

151
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
And if you haven't heard it all it's all up on the feed now

152
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
We went for 10 and a half hours live

153
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
But when you take out the music it was about 9 hours 30-40 minutes worth of podcast

154
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
In good times

155
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
And we didn't end up playing any games live on air like we thought we were going to

156
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
So just really good times

157
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
We did match games

158
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
No no no I meant video games

159
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Oh

160
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
On air not the OLR games

161
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
But yeah I mean and big thanks to Alan and Bradley too

162
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Dan sure did

163
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Without their help

164
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Dan

165
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
He played the game that shall not be named

166
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
For a very long time

167
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Yet

168
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Yes he was playing the Reach Around game for some time

169
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
He and his friend

170
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
That's what they finished

171
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Yes he and Alex were playing Reach Around

172
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
For a while

173
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Has he finished the game yet

174
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I have no idea Dan left for Washington State to go spend like 8 days with his family and

175
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Leave me here by my you

176
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Oh whatever you're going to run around the house naked and play Star Trek online

177
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
That's what I do anyway

178
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Well not during the show thankfully

179
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I was playing it when you came in the house

180
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
With her clothes on thankfully

181
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Yes

182
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I'm wearing my stylish X-Men t-shirt

183
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
But it's why she probably had the door locked

184
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
So when I banged on the door she was like oh shit where's my bra

185
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Alright anyway

186
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Oh bored fat fat fat

187
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Alright uh ew

188
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
How was your gaming week Dark Soccer besides naked Star Trek

189
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I wasn't naked

190
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I was playing Star Trek online when Rob came in

191
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
And I actually stopped in the middle of the part that I was on

192
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Because when I start the game I'll just start right back from where I am

193
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Which is a very good thing about Star Trek online

194
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Unless you're like right at the beginning of it

195
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
And you're almost done with the first part and then you die

196
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Anyway um

197
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I played Peggle

198
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
You know I haven't touched Epic Citadel since I downloaded it

199
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Except to upgrade it

200
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
And I really haven't done much else in the way of gaming

201
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Well Dan got uh

202
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Not

203
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Dead Rising 2

204
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I always want to say Left 4 Dead but

205
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It's Dead Rising 2 the Mission Zero

206
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
K-Zero

207
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
And he's gotten all of the endings except

208
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Man the bad ending where the little girl turns into a zombie

209
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
OMG spoilers

210
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Don't care

211
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
If you haven't downloaded it yet and if you haven't got there by now

212
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Then I don't want to hear it

213
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Plus it's kind of obvious

214
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It doesn't even show her turning into a zombie

215
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Well I mean she's a child

216
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I don't care I wanted to see a zombie five year old

217
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I'm sorry you were disappointed

218
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I mean it's like when you watch zombie movies

219
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Okay okay

220
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
When you watch zombie movies right

221
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Shouldn't there be like zombie dogs and children

222
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
And zombie old people

223
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
And

224
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
You know and like zombies in wheelchairs

225
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Well actually there wasn't Shaun of the Dead

226
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I suppose it depends on how graphic you want to get

227
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Like and all the people in hospitals turning into zombies and stuff

228
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It's

229
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It just doesn't make sense to me

230
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
But yeah

231
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I also have that problem with zombie video games

232
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
It was pretty cool though

233
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Especially my favorite weapon that you can make in that game

234
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Is you can get a pitchfork

235
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
And attach it to a rifle

236
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
And then you can stab them with a pitchfork

237
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Pull them up in the air and shoot them with a shotgun

238
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
And they'll explode

239
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
That's awesome

240
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
And you can also go to this place and get a broadsword

241
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
And slice zombies down the middle

242
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
And like you can make like the nail bat and everything

243
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
But man the pitchfork bayonet

244
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
That's innovation

245
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I haven't figured out any weapon combinations

246
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Outside of the nails and bat

247
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Only because I was specifically shown that at E3

248
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
How to do that

249
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Pitchfork, rifle

250
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Well you try to figure stuff out

251
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
And then also you get cards

252
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
And you can take all that stuff into the main game later on

253
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
And it even has a dude throwing up

254
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Hooray

255
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Yes

256
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
And then you can tape him to a cat

257
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
And he becomes a weapon right

258
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
But I do love that idea

259
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It certainly seems one step past

260
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
The Fable 2 pub games

261
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Which was a neat little innovation in itself

262
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
But this is kind of like taking it to the next level

263
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Where like now a games demo

264
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Is actually a whole different game

265
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
And yeah you pay for it

266
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
But it's kind of a standalone experience

267
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
And you know you get to take what you've earned into the main game

268
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
It's kind of neat

269
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
And it's got three different endings

270
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
It's reverse DLC

271
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It's not download content to expand the game

272
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
It's very strange

273
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
But I like it

274
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
It was really cool

275
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
When Dan did one of the bad endings

276
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
He had the dude with the mohawk wearing a waitress dress

277
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
And I was like

278
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Okay that's pretty funny

279
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Because you see this burly guy walking in

280
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Wearing this dress

281
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
And then falling to his knees

282
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I can't wait to see some of the hideous costumes you can put the main character in

283
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Because I'll tell you what

284
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Some of the best parts of the first one

285
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Were some of the really skanky costumes

286
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
And the random and children's clothing

287
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
And the Mega Man outfit

288
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
This one's set in Las Vegas isn't it?

289
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Yes

290
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
So we need to have the whole showgirls

291
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
You know big fantail

292
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
And we have to go find Tiara Zombie

293
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Because she lives in Vegas

294
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
And undoubtedly be a zombie in the game

295
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
We won't aim for the head on the Tiara Zombie

296
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I'll refrain from using the pitchfork bayonetta

297
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
On Tiara

298
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
What I'll do I'll put a cardboard box on her head

299
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
And just watch her run around

300
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
In the garden playing PS2 games

301
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Like in Shaun of the Dead

302
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I can't wait to see what kind of comment we get from her

303
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Because she's on AOL during the show right?

304
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Yeah I don't know I have to ask her if she's listening

305
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Let's see going to our chatroom

306
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
At chat.orangelaunchradio.com

307
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Let's see a hitstun suggests a cat gun

308
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
To which actdeft is saying laser cat gun

309
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
That would be a great weapon

310
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I could see using a laser cat

311
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
That would be amazing

312
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Loki how was your gaming week?

313
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Pretty eventful actually

314
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Because we did our game summit thing

315
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
At our work where we invite publishers

316
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
And some of our customers out

317
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
And we did it this year kind of

318
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Expo style I guess

319
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Each publisher had a different booth

320
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
For the ones that showed up

321
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Not that many bright games though

322
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Even though I offered them like

323
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Hey if you need to borrow a 360 or something

324
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I can help you out with that

325
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
So I only played really

326
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Like a few different things

327
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
The first one

328
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
And there is a video out there

329
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Of it somewhere I don't want to know

330
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Where though

331
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
The first game I played this week was

332
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Just Dance 2

333
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
And only because

334
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
The Ubisoft rep wanted

335
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
To demonstrate it and no one would play it

336
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
So I was like okay fine

337
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I'll do this and be a good sport about it

338
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
So I did that

339
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
And she kicked my ass in every single song

340
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Even though she says she didn't play it before

341
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I don't believe her

342
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
It was actually kind of fun

343
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
It's kind of neat because the game itself

344
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
If you haven't played it yet

345
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
It's going to be very similar to what Dance Central

346
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I guess is going to be

347
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
It pretty much just plays like that

348
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
And all you do is you hold the remote

349
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
And you just kind of mimic what's on the screen

350
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
And it will just kind of

351
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
It'll only detect what you're doing with the remote

352
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
But it's still pretty close

353
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
And it's fun

354
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
And it's got some decent songs in there

355
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Did you jam to TikTok?

356
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Did you get your Kesha on?

357
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Yes we did actually

358
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Why?

359
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Why is this not on YouTube?

360
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Why is there not video of Loki playing Just Dance 2?

361
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I am so upset

362
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
We mean why is this on YouTube?

363
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
It is on YouTube

364
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Oh my god where?

365
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I don't know

366
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
There is video of you on YouTube playing Just Dance 2

367
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I don't see it

368
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Tiger Claw

369
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
He's the best web scavenger I know

370
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Tiger Claw needs to find this somehow

371
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Use your Google Fu Ninja abilities

372
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I don't know if my boss has uploaded it yet

373
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Because they were taking video

374
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Oh man as soon as this is up you've got to tell me

375
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Yeah I do I guess

376
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Anyways

377
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Try not to sound too excited

378
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Yeah

379
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I'm going to see if I can find

380
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I'm sorry you can find it later

381
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I don't want to cause too much dead air while you search

382
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Yeah no problem

383
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Anyways

384
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
So other than Just Dance 2 I got to play around with some of the move demo stuff

385
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I played actually the full version of Sports Champions

386
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Which is kind of fun

387
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I kind of like the archery that's in the game

388
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
And that was pretty cool

389
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
It sucks though because at the time though

390
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
They had this kit that they had

391
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Or it was actually one of the retail

392
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Not 4

393
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
250GB systems that they're going to be selling

394
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
With Sports Champions bundled in there and stuff

395
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
So they have

396
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
You can play a lot of these games

397
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Like the archery stuff

398
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Either with two of the move controllers

399
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Or one controller

400
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
So the one controller has it

401
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
You take the move and you kind of

402
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Put it over your shoulder like you're pulling an arrow out of a quiver

403
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
And then you kind of point it at the screen

404
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
That way

405
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
And it actually worked really well

406
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
And then I also played some of the frisbee golf

407
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Which was kind of fun

408
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
But I'm horrible at frisbee golf

409
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I tried a little bit of the table tennis

410
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I don't care for the table tennis too much

411
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
But

412
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
How did archery in the PlayStation Move sports game

413
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Compare to archery in Wii sport resort

414
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Or whatever

415
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I haven't played Wii sports resort yet

416
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
But I think it would be way more accurate

417
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Than it is

418
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
It's just

419
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I don't know, it just felt right

420
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I guess

421
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I haven't played it with two of the

422
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Two of the controllers yet

423
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I do have my own kit now

424
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I have two of the move controllers

425
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Which Rob was

426
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Sticking on his chest earlier

427
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
And I'm sure there's pictures online

428
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I would not say that those pictures exist on Twitter

429
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
He wouldn't say that

430
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
No

431
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
So I got to play that

432
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Well it makes sense to me

433
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Sony decided to release

434
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Some of the move required games

435
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
On the 7th

436
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Of September

437
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
And while that may be the case

438
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
You're not going to find them in stores

439
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Because

440
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Like most smart stores

441
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
They're not going to overnight some product

442
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
To their stores

443
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
So that it can't be played for a week

444
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Thus frustrating people

445
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
So actually

446
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I got to play this by today

447
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
And no one had any of the stuff that's already out

448
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
For the move

449
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Which is disappointing because I have just the demos to play right now

450
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Which is fine, they're still fun

451
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Another demo I checked out was

452
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Ipet

453
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
And I got to say Ipet is retarded

454
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
And it really does not work

455
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
It seems like a neat idea at first

456
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
But you mean

457
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
To actually get it so that it looks right

458
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
You have to get the camera at

459
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
The perfect angle

460
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
For a crappy

461
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Itoy game

462
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Way back in the Playstation 2

463
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
And stuff

464
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
It's not good at all

465
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
It doesn't lend well to the argument that

466
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
This is just the itoy all over again

467
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
It does not

468
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Thankfully that's the only game that's the case

469
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
With

470
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
They have you

471
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Do a few different things

472
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
For example they have you

473
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Play with

474
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Him I guess you move your fingers

475
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
And he's supposed to roll over

476
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
And stuff

477
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
And it just did not detect that

478
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
It was just having trouble figuring out what I was trying to do

479
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
And then it had me

480
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Draw an airplane

481
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
And he'd fly around in it

482
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
And I don't know what the

483
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Problem was with this but for some reason

484
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I'm pretty good at tracing

485
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Outlines and stuff

486
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Like on the Wii and the DS

487
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
And that kind of thing

488
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
When you see outline for the plane

489
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Using the Playstation move controller

490
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
It looked like crap

491
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
It just was not working too well

492
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
But you know hey whatever

493
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
It's a crappy game to begin with

494
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
And then also they have you trying to wash him

495
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
And the problem is I couldn't tell

496
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Like I had trouble figuring out

497
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
You know whether my move controller

498
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Was in front or behind him

499
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
And stuff like that so I had to kind of try to figure out

500
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Where to turn it in perspective

501
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
It's just very awkward

502
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
But I mean most people will figure out

503
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
That it's a waste of time anyways

504
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Then what else did I try

505
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I tried the Tiger Woods demo

506
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
And that worked alright

507
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
It's just very difficult to get it set up

508
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
So that

509
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
It you know

510
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
So you can use the move controller

511
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
At least I found that it was kind of difficult to get it set up

512
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Oh and calibrating it's actually pretty easy

513
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
As far as

514
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Because I was reading some reviews

515
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
You know for different things

516
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
They had to constantly calibrate the controller

517
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I didn't find that to be the case actually

518
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
With sports champions you calibrate it once

519
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
And you're good to go

520
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
So that was kind of cool

521
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
And I'm trying to think of what else I played

522
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
That was kind of fun

523
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I tried the

524
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
It's like that

525
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Some kung fu game

526
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Where you actually

527
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Roll down the street on like office chairs

528
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
And that was crap

529
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
It did not control well

530
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Sports champions is fun

531
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Wasn't there a mini game in

532
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Incredible Crisis where you go down the street

533
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
In a chair no it's on a

534
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Gurney

535
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Yes it's on the hospital bed yeah

536
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Looking at our chat room chat

537
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
BlackWolf is in our chat

538
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
The good pal of ours that does the show before us

539
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Live at All Games Radio

540
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
When we tape live on Sunday nights

541
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
He says oh cool I didn't realize that move was coming out on Friday

542
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
And not Sunday originally it was coming out on Sunday

543
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Yeah they kept moving it around

544
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
In fact the Sony reps had trouble remembering

545
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
What day it was supposed to be coming out on

546
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
But yeah it's Friday now not Sunday

547
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Although there are some games coming out on Sunday

548
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
But you don't really need to mess with those

549
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
It's just the Brunswick bowling game

550
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
So would you be paying money for this?

551
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Would I be paying money for it?

552
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
If you didn't already have it in your hot little hands

553
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Would you pay money for it?

554
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I might but the problem is I don't know how much

555
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I'm going to play with this

556
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
But it's pretty fun

557
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
It's definitely

558
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
If you like the Wii stuff you're going to probably like this

559
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
But it is a lot more sensitive

560
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I think so they kind of took

561
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
What they did on the Wii and improved

562
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Upon it which is good so

563
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
As long as they come out with

564
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Good games for it then I don't think it's

565
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
A bad investment at all

566
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
And the best part about it

567
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
This is like a lot of the stuff

568
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
You probably don't need to get the navigation controller

569
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
For because most of the games don't use it

570
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Oh wow

571
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Really you're only going to use the navigation controller

572
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
You're going to be playing like SoCom or Killzone 3

573
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I think

574
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I got to admit I'm not sure it's the greatest idea

575
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
That they do this whole

576
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Separate skews

577
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
For like a camera

578
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
A camera and

579
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
One controller, a controller

580
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
And the navigation

581
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
It kind of seems like it's too complicated to figure out

582
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
What you need and with all these different

583
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Peripherals out there

584
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
It's tough for the designer

585
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I like that they did that though because I own a camera

586
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Now that I've got the kit

587
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I've got two cameras for no reason

588
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
But the whole optional navigation controller

589
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Which I guess is true on the Wii to an extent

590
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
But every Wii comes with one at least

591
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
So the designers know they can do at least one

592
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Well technically it still comes with one

593
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Because it comes with a regular DualShock controller

594
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Which can double as the navigation controller

595
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
If you want it to

596
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
So if you really

597
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
It's kind of awkward to hold it

598
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Because you have to hold it with one hand

599
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
But I mean

600
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
If you really care then you can use that

601
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
As a navigation controller

602
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
If for example

603
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Like you're playing Killzone 3

604
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Or something like that and you want to try out the move

605
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Controls and you have a move controller

606
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
But you don't have the navigation controller

607
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
You can get by with that

608
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
But you may want to get an actual navigation controller

609
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Later on

610
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Looking at our chat room live on this Sunday night

611
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
At chat.orangeloungeradio.com

612
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Tigerclaw is saying, speaking of move

613
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Sony launched an anti-connect site about the buttons

614
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
YayButtons.com

615
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I'd heard about this but I didn't

616
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
It wasn't on our list for tonight

617
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Have you looked at this site at all?

618
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Yeah I mean that's great that they have a campaign

619
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
About yay buttons and stuff like that

620
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I do love that website name

621
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I gotta say

622
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Yay Buttons is a good name for a site

623
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
That's a stupid argument to make right now

624
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Because

625
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Even Microsoft came out and said

626
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Well we never said that we can't have a game

627
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
That uses both the connect camera

628
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
And the controller

629
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
So you know

630
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Hooray with your campaign and everything

631
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
And really all these games

632
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
That they have out there right now

633
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Just use either the trigger

634
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Or the top move button

635
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Or basically the A and B button

636
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
On a Wii remote

637
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Because a lot of these games play just like Wii games

638
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I mean it's

639
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
What a shock

640
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I know, what a shock that they play like Wii games

641
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I don't know

642
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
It's kind of fun

643
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I mean if you

644
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
If you're looking for something that's gonna be

645
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Way better than the Wii

646
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
You're probably not gonna find it with this

647
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Alright so what games

648
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Do we have to look forward to on the move

649
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
That you're gonna be checking out for us?

650
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Well the

651
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
You know

652
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Sports Champions

653
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
That's pretty good

654
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I actually haven't played it yet

655
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
But there's that

656
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Time Crisis Raising Storm

657
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
That looked kind of fun

658
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I like the Toy Story 3 game but

659
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
If it's too much money I wouldn't bother

660
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
It was cute though

661
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
It reminded me of Midway Mania

662
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I might check out

663
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I'm trying to think what else

664
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I would probably pick up for that

665
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I don't know

666
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
It's hard to say right now

667
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I'm not gonna pick up

668
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
SOCOM

669
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Maybe some of the PlayStation Network games

670
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I'll just see whatever they throw my way

671
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Cause I don't want to spend a lot of money

672
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Alright

673
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Well let's talk about My Gaming Week

674
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Actually before we get to My Gaming Week though

675
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I want to make a special phone call here a little bit

676
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I'm gonna actually call

677
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
He was here last week on the show

678
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
He's Alan AKA Salacious Pop

679
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
AKA my boyfriend

680
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Is sitting there at his computer

681
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
And he knows we're calling him cause I want to talk about something here tonight

682
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Hey Alan are you there?

683
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Yep

684
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
So Alan

685
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
You live in the Bay Area

686
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
In California right?

687
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Yes

688
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
And you don't live that far away from where there was actually

689
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
A really bad tragedy this week right?

690
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Yep

691
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Tell us a little bit about what happened

692
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Thursday evening at about 615

693
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
A giant gas main

694
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Several feet across

695
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Blew up underneath some houses

696
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
And kind of destroyed an entire neighborhood

697
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Very sad

698
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
And a lot of trouble

699
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
When they sort through all that mess

700
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
But very very sad tragedy

701
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
So I mean was it scary?

702
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Did you have to evacuate?

703
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Did you have to get out of the house?

704
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
What happened?

705
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Well it happened

706
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
The neighborhood affected is maybe two miles away from me

707
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Which is very close

708
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
But when it comes to horrible things happening

709
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Is actually a safe amount of distance

710
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
I actually did not know

711
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
What was going on

712
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Until about 30 minutes later

713
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
When my roommate knocked on the door and said

714
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Hey do you know what's going on outside the window right now?

715
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,000
But I may as well have been in another city

716
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
This block that I'm on was totally unaffected

717
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
All of the wind blew all the smoke

718
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
And everything south

719
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Well I'm happy to hear you're okay

720
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
And that you're out of it fine

721
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
But I remember last year it was around Christmas

722
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Or whatever

723
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
A very similar thing happened where I was living at the time

724
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
In a suburb called Rancho Cordova

725
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
And a house literally blew up

726
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Because of a gas leak

727
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
And I remember distinctly

728
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Even though I was about a mile away

729
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
I heard this giant boom noise

730
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
And things actually shook for a minute

731
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
And my car had ash on it

732
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
It was crazy

733
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
It was really sad

734
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
But you didn't hear a giant boom

735
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
You didn't feel the shake

736
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Or was it just oh another earthquake

737
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I don't get it. What happened?

738
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
So only being two miles away

739
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
And it being as large as it was

740
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
It did actually shake the building that I'm in

741
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Apparently it rattled windows for miles

742
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
In every direction

743
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
I was completely oblivious though

744
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Because at the time I was raiding

745
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
In WOW

746
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Which is really the punchline

747
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
That you were trying desperately to get me to

748
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
So yes, I was raiding in WOW

749
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
While 53 homes were completely razzed

750
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
And my housemate had to tell me

751
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
To look out the window

752
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
To see what was going on

753
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
And he had to tell me to look out the window

754
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
To see all the black smoke

755
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Yes, there's the punchline I was looking for

756
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
And why I brought you on to tell this horrible

757
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Tragedy story on the video game radio show

758
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Is that you missed

759
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Total chaos and tragedy

760
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Going on mere miles away

761
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Because you were trying to get Fester got down

762
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Yeah

763
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Everyone's judging me right now

764
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Did you get any loot?

765
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
No

766
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I got no good drops

767
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
But what must have been your reaction though

768
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
When you opened up the window

769
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
And just saw all the smoke

770
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Were you just like, oh damn

771
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Well yeah, I was like

772
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
That's not good

773
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
And then I went to KCBS

774
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
And SF Gate and I started looking at the feeds

775
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Because there was a huge boom

776
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
That set off the gas explosion

777
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
And people didn't know what it was

778
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
So they thought that maybe a plane had crashed

779
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Into a house and that set off

780
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
The gas main, which wasn't the case

781
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
So I was reading all the speculation on

782
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
If an airplane went down

783
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Which there wasn't, just something sparked

784
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
And set off the crack in the pipe

785
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
But yeah, so once

786
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
I realized what was going on

787
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I took time to check it out

788
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
And after the sunset I could see the orange

789
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Glow over the hill

790
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Because the fire burned for

791
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
A couple hours because they couldn't turn

792
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
The gas main off, so it was like a big blowtorch

793
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Oh my gosh, so sad

794
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Yeah, I can't even imagine

795
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Just being at home, watching Oprah

796
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Or being like Dark Sakura, sitting around naked

797
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Playing Star Trek online

798
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
And then suddenly, kaboom

799
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Oops

800
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
PG and E didn't notice the crack in the pipe

801
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Uh oh, you know what's actually kind of sad

802
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Though, you know, and again

803
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
I seriously don't mean to make light of a tragedy

804
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
It's just kind of interesting that

805
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Sometimes we get so

806
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
In the zone of gaming that we miss these things

807
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
But it's kind of funny, I have a similar story

808
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
It's not really gaming related, but it was a couple years ago

809
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Um, 07 maybe

810
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I had just moved into the house

811
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
I was at, where we had the OLR studio before

812
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
I don't know if I ever brought this up on the show

813
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
But the house across the street

814
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
From us burned down, like it caught fire

815
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
And burned down one night

816
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
And I totally missed it going on

817
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I was at home, and totally didn't even

818
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
See it happening, you know why?

819
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
I was asleep, I was taking a nap

820
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
After work, and my roommate comes home

821
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
And is like, Rob, Rob, are you here?

822
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Rob, Rob, where's Rob?

823
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Practically barking, and I'm like, what's going on?

824
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
He's like, do you not hear the fire trucks

825
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Outside right now?

826
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Do you not see the news media?

827
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
And I kind of do that thing where like

828
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
I'm kind of groggy and I'm peeking out the window

829
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
And it's just like, oh shit

830
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
The house burned down across the street

831
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
I'm pretty sure it was a meth lab

832
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
But, you know

833
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
It's a good thing it didn't spread

834
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Thank you fire department

835
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
When I was in grade school

836
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
I'm living in Martinez

837
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Martinez has a huge

838
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Ugly shell oil refinery

839
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Behind it, for anyone that's ever been in Martinez

840
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
It looks very

841
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Blade runner

842
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
It's very gross and huge

843
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
And that had an explosion

844
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
And I think like

845
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Two or three workers unfortunately died

846
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
At the time, I was like 10 or 11 years old

847
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
When this happened

848
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
And again, the refinery is maybe

849
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Four or five miles

850
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
And you can see the smokestacks of it

851
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
From out our kitchen window

852
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
And that actually shook the house

853
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
And I was very much aware of what was happening then

854
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
So, yeah

855
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
And I was probably playing my nest at the time

856
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
So

857
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Yeah, I felt that one

858
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
But this one, two miles away

859
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I was like

860
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Wrath, wrath, wrath eclipse

861
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Starfire, starfire, starfire

862
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I didn't, I don't know

863
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Alright, well look

864
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
We do want to make a donation to the victims of

865
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
San Bruno, which you know, we don't

866
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Again, we don't mean to make fun of it

867
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
We're making fun of Alan and the fact that he missed it

868
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
And not making fun of what happened

869
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Because it really is a tragedy

870
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
We do definitely want you to consider

871
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Maybe making a donation to the Red Cross

872
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
To help the victims of the San Bruno fire

873
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
They can be reached at 1-800-RED-CROSS

874
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Simply on the phone

875
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
And if you specify that you want to donate to the San Bruno fire

876
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
They will pass those donations along

877
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
You can also visit them on the web

878
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
There's also a specific website

879
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
www.redcrossbayarea.org

880
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
But Alan would appreciate it

881
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
If you sent him all your leet purples

882
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
And wow gold, correct?

883
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
And for those OLR listeners

884
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Living in the Bay Area that have donated blood

885
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
That don't have ridiculous restrictions

886
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Against them, that prevents them from donating blood

887
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Which, archaic, archaic things

888
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
That need to be changed

889
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
But, you know

890
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Unfortunately, we don't want to hold

891
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Those silly restrictions against the victims

892
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
So we'll donate cash I guess

893
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
But definitely

894
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Well thanks for calling

895
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Hey, no problem, thanks for being on the show

896
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Thank you for letting me make fun of you

897
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
See, this is why you rock

898
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Thank you Alan

899
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
For letting me make fun of you a little bit on the show

900
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
I actually don't have a whole lot to add to that

901
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
My gaming week was kind of uninteresting outside of wow myself

902
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
If my neighborhood had exploded

903
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
I would have probably not noticed it either

904
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Because I would have been doing the same thing

905
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
I did check out one new game though

906
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
The iPhone now has the Game Center

907
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Right, just launched this week

908
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Now Game Center is available on the iPhone

909
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
What a pointless thing

910
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
It doesn't do anything

911
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
And these are like two half-assed things

912
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
That Apple has launched lately between PING

913
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Which is like, I think it's like Twitter

914
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
But it's not

915
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Because all it really shows is the music

916
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Game Room, you just have a friends list

917
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
And you can see what games they own

918
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
And what achievements they have

919
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
But I have yet to see how that whole

920
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
multiplayer integration works

921
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Or anything like that

922
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
I don't get it

923
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
I haven't tried any of those

924
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
But because I'm a sucker and because I had credit

925
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Still from gift cards I got for my birthday a few months ago

926
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
I downloaded one of the Game Center compatible games

927
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
It's a game called

928
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Graal Classic Plus

929
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
And I was drawn to check out this game

930
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Because the artwork kind of makes it look like

931
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
This little Legend of Zelda-y

932
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Chibi type of game

933
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
And it said it was an MMO

934
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
I have a neat idea, like an MMO on the iPhone

935
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
That kind of looks like a Super Nintendo game, right?

936
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Awesome? Oh my god

937
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
It's the worst thing I've ever played in my life

938
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
It is so stupid

939
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Did you spend money on that?

940
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Well, I spent someone else's money

941
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Because it was gift cards

942
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
I spent $1.99 on that

943
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
And it is so stupid

944
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
It's one of those

945
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
It's the equivalent of one of those MMOs

946
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
That you would see the cards for at the grocery store

947
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
That you just kind of laugh out

948
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
By those, right?

949
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
It's worse than Farmville

950
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Farmville's pretty awful

951
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
I don't understand

952
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
There's no quests

953
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
There's no leveling

954
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
It's just make a character and run around

955
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Stabbing bushes, hoping you find

956
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Little green gems in them

957
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
I think there's guilds

958
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
But the chat is all screwed up

959
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
It's just overcome with idiocy

960
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
And just people

961
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Yelling weird things

962
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
On the road and trying to trick people

963
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Into giving honor points

964
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
I don't get it

965
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Why would anyone waste their time with this garbage

966
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Well, I did, I guess

967
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Boy, did I pick a stinker to test out Game Center with

968
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
So now I've decided Game Center is completely stupid

969
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
And a waste of time

970
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Based on this one game that I played

971
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
So, yeah

972
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
That would be the one new game

973
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
That I checked out this week

974
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Again, that's Brawl Classic Plus

975
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Look, if you want to burn $2

976
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
It's one of those, I'm almost thinking it's so bad

977
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
You have to see it

978
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
If anybody can figure out the point of this game

979
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
I would love to hear from you

980
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
I would love to hear from the developers of this game

981
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Of what it is they were trying to do with this game

982
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Because I don't get it

983
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Pull you into paying for it

984
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Help

985
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
So there you go

986
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Game Center, fail

987
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Ping, fail

988
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Brawl, whatever, plus plus, mega fail

989
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Otherwise, it's just been more Warcraft

990
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Oh, I did play Dead Rising

991
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Case Zero myself

992
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
And it was fun

993
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
But I got eaten by a lot of zombies

994
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Because I'm not very good at Dead Rising

995
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Did the military kill you?

996
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Did you find all the bike parts easily?

997
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
No, I was trying to get to the van with the Zombrex

998
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
And I got chewed up, I didn't get very far at all

999
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
But I liked that there were so many cut scenes

1000
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
And everything in an arcade game

1001
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
I thought that was kind of cool

1002
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
That was pretty neat, I thought it was fun

1003
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Pitchfork, rifle, win

1004
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Alright

1005
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Let's see, going to

1006
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
You know what, it just occurred to me what a cool weapon would be

1007
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Take like three broadswords and a pogo stick

1008
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
And you'd have pogo stab

1009
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
That would be awesome

1010
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Going to our chatroom at chat.orangesolentrader.com

1011
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Marissa Congusto, we love Marissa

1012
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
I love her

1013
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Marissa, I love you

1014
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Alright, I'm going to poop on ping

1015
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
She's pooping, get it?

1016
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
She's going to poop on ping

1017
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Pooping

1018
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Because it censors tweets from artists

1019
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Such as Gaga's pro gay marriage tweets

1020
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Eye roll, it's useless

1021
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
I didn't even know they did that

1022
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
That would be a great name for a website though

1023
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Pooping

1024
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
That's great

1025
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Somebody needs to register that

1026
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Oh yeah, it's like a copy of Twitter

1027
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Can somebody please explain to me the point of ping and game center

1028
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,000
And the sad thing is they both sounded really good

1029
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Just like ping pals? Did that sound good too?

1030
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,000
I'm thinking the word ping is just death for your service

1031
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
I remember when ping

1032
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Coming next week, Orange Ping Radio

1033
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Was just, you know, on the other IRC screen where it just went ping, ping, ping

1034
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,000
There was also an app for the iPhone for a limited time called ping

1035
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
And it was like free SMS basically, to put it lightly

1036
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
They changed their name a few months ago to ping chat

1037
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
And they never said why, now I know

1038
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Because Apple probably said

1039
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
You better change your name or we're going to pooping on you

1040
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
So there you go

1041
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Maybe we can release an app called pooping

1042
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:43,000
You know what, we should get someone who can program like that and do an app to make fun of it called pooping

1043
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Or cropping

1044
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
It probably would not get approved by the app store

1045
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Maybe you could put it on Android

1046
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Like a social network called pooping

1047
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
And it could be all about

1048
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Like, you know, because that's what Twitter is for

1049
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
It's all for talking shit about people

1050
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Well no, you know how you make tweets when you go to the bathroom

1051
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
I'm pooping right now

1052
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Or actually, well I noticed that the lovely Jessica Harper is in our chat right now

1053
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
She's from Under Station Live

1054
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Which is live here at All Games this Saturday night

1055
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,000
And I know she uses Foursquare to check in from her toilet

1056
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Because she actually has a location called sitting on the toilet

1057
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
So I could see that being a use of like, pooping

1058
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Would be like, you know, sitting on the toilet

1059
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Or it could be like, it could be reviews of stalls around the nation

1060
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
I ate lots of fiber today

1061
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
This is really painful

1062
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Like, you know, Burger King bathroom, well cleaned

1063
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Smells like bleach

1064
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Anyhow, chat.orangelaunchrater.com if you'd like to join

1065
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
And join in the madness

1066
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Marissa said that Steve Jobs said himself no more fart apps

1067
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Really?

1068
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
That's a good thing, I think

1069
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
We don't need any more fart apps

1070
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Alright, LightAmiga777 in chat says, OLR poop

1071
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Where there's smoke, they ping back

1072
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
I think I get that

1073
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Alright, let's go ahead and actually get into some gaming news tonight

1074
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Oh, quick housekeeping

1075
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Add us on Facebook, facebook.com slash orangelaunchradio

1076
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
We also have a Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR

1077
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
And you should add us on those sites

1078
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
And yeah, otherwise

1079
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
I don't think there's a whole lot of news going on here

1080
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
I'm gonna be out the first week of October

1081
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
October 2nd, 3rd, somewhere in there

1082
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
I'm gonna be gone that week

1083
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
So I don't know if there'll be a show

1084
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Bring me pins

1085
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
There can be

1086
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
But I'm going to Gay Days at Disneyland

1087
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Bring me pins

1088
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Lots of them

1089
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
I'm taking Alan for the first time since he was 18

1090
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
I know

1091
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Don't worry, we're going back for Tron, remember?

1092
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
December 17th is a big day

1093
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Yes, we are, but you still must bring me pins

1094
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
I will

1095
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Maybe they'll have a Tron pin

1096
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
If you find Tron pins, you better

1097
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
I will

1098
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
I will give you monies

1099
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
For pins, for Tron

1100
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Alright, let's get into some actual bonafide gaming news

1101
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
We're only like 40 minutes in this show

1102
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
And haven't talked a lot about gaming news

1103
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Loki, what's up in the world of gaming?

1104
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Well, lots of stuff

1105
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Especially when it comes to PS3 and firmware

1106
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
And all that fun stuff

1107
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Well, starting things off

1108
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
You knew what was gonna happen

1109
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
The Playstation 3 got a mandatory firmware

1110
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Bringing it up to 3.42

1111
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
This firmware update does nothing

1112
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Other than break the PS

1113
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Jailbreak and the PS Groove hacks

1114
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
And since this was

1115
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
An overall security

1116
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Related issue

1117
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
It says we will provide no further

1118
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Commentary to this case

1119
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Well, that's a

1120
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Wonderful thing to say

1121
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Fucking dick of a Sony rep

1122
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Well, to be fair

1123
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Well, why didn't they just say

1124
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
We're not providing commentary

1125
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
In this case, nah

1126
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
They could just say, we don't like people hacking our consoles

1127
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Devil's advocate

1128
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
A, they don't owe you shit for an explanation

1129
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
B, maybe they plan to litigate against these people

1130
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
So they don't want to say anything publicly

1131
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Because there's gonna be litigation in the future

1132
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
I don't know if they can, because

1133
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
I don't know, because the

1134
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Oh, come on, this is America, they can sue anyone

1135
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
They can try, I guess

1136
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Shrine's important for them

1137
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Yay buttons, I don't know

1138
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Yaylawsuit.com

1139
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
No new features, though

1140
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
In this latest firmware, right?

1141
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
The only feature is disabling this

1142
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
If you are interested still in running

1143
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Homebrew stuff, and we will get to why

1144
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
The homebrew is not all bad

1145
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Remember, it's just that backup device

1146
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
That's the bad thing

1147
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Homebrew, not so bad

1148
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Of course, Sony just sees the backup device

1149
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
And that's all they care about

1150
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
So if you don't want to update to 3.41

1151
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Stay off the PlayStation Network

1152
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
It's interesting, though

1153
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Because one of the things that actually

1154
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Did come around because of this

1155
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Is a way to enable

1156
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Any PlayStation 3 game

1157
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
To be played as

1158
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
A remote play game

1159
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
On your PSP

1160
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Why they aren't like that in the first place

1161
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Is beyond me, but apparently

1162
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
It's a really simple edit to

1163
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
One of the files that's on there

1164
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
That you basically

1165
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
You can actually run this program called

1166
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
A PS3 SFO editor

1167
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Once you have your game dumped

1168
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
To the hard drive

1169
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
And you just click a button that says

1170
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
PSP Remote Play Available

1171
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
And then click it and it will allow you to play

1172
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
It over your PSP

1173
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Including games that don't allow it

1174
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Like, for example, Infamous

1175
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
They actually have video of that

1176
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
That's kind of neat

1177
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
And a feature I don't see why they don't have

1178
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Maybe because it's buggy

1179
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
In some games, I don't know, but

1180
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
If it can be done

1181
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
I don't know why they don't

1182
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Well, you kind of answered your own question

1183
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
If it bugs in some games, that's gonna be enough

1184
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
I think

1185
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
It has to work consistently or they're not gonna implement it

1186
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
I would think

1187
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Well, I don't know about that, but

1188
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Has it ever stopped developers from

1189
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Rushing out games?

1190
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Point taken

1191
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
So, yeah, I don't know

1192
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
And then, let's see

1193
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Other fun stuff

1194
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Of course, the PlayStation

1195
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Freedom

1196
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
It is the port of the

1197
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
PS Groove, I guess

1198
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
It's basically the open source

1199
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Device or

1200
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Code that you can throw on

1201
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
A USB stick

1202
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Well, the PS Freedom

1203
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Which was the one that's actually being ported

1204
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
To the PSP

1205
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
And everything else

1206
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Is actually available on quite a few different things

1207
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Including

1208
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
The iPhone and iPod

1209
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
That is, of course, if you have

1210
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Your phone or iPod

1211
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Jailbroken

1212
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
And basically what this does is

1213
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
It runs a modified

1214
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Program on the

1215
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Android operating system

1216
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
There's all the different things that do it

1217
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
That way

1218
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Which is kind of interesting

1219
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
They actually have it ported

1220
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Funny enough

1221
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
To the TI-84

1222
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Man, those calculators can do anything

1223
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Including

1224
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Wow, they still make those

1225
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
That was the graphing calculator back in my day

1226
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Yeah

1227
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Or maybe it was the 82, I don't know, but still

1228
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Well, they had the 84s back in my day

1229
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
But I think they're a little bit newer now

1230
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
But yeah, they actually

1231
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
You're officially 30 now, you're old

1232
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
I'm sorry to interrupt, I've been told to make a small noise

1233
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Okay

1234
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
What?

1235
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
You can continue

1236
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Okay, other devices that the

1237
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
PS Freedom has been ported to

1238
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
The HTC Droid Incredible

1239
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
The HTC Wildfire

1240
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
The HTC Magic 32A

1241
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
The Dream G1

1242
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Magic 32B

1243
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
These are all HTC Foams

1244
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
The Palm Pre

1245
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
The Dingu

1246
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
I actually have a Dingu

1247
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
I haven't gotten a chance to do it yet

1248
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
But I may try that

1249
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
The Sony Ericsson Xperia X1

1250
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
The Nokia N900

1251
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Or N800 or N810

1252
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
The Droid

1253
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
The Droid

1254
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Aris

1255
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Of course, the original

1256
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Oh, and the Palm Pre

1257
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Yeah, so basically

1258
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Everything

1259
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
And if it's not out for your device

1260
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
It will probably be ported to it

1261
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
You know

1262
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
I guess it's not such a bad thing if

1263
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
You know, you're really interested

1264
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
In actually putting this

1265
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
You know, exploit on your console

1266
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
It should be readily available

1267
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
To do so

1268
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
And if it's not for stuff that you may have

1269
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
At home right now, it will be probably soon

1270
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
I'm sure, you know

1271
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
A piece of French toast will eventually be able to be

1272
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Used in hacking your

1273
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
PS3, so

1274
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Just have to give it some time

1275
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
I did forget to mention

1276
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Earlier in the show that because

1277
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
You know, you're now officially 30, right Loki?

1278
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Yes I am

1279
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
So now it's officially the gaming show for

1280
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
30-somethings is Orange Lounge

1281
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Radio, that's right

1282
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
The old crotchety video gaming show

1283
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
We actually have a new theme song

1284
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
For the new Orange Lounge Radio, we're gonna be debuting

1285
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Do we? Yeah, we should have done it tonight

1286
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
But we'll do it next week

1287
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Since we're so old, here's our new theme song you guys

1288
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Thank you for being a friend

1289
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
That old

1290
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Rob your dork

1291
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Back in my day

1292
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Oregon and

1293
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Trail was in green, and only green

1294
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
And we liked it

1295
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Hey

1296
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
On the DSI

1297
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
There's a new firmware update as well

1298
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
The 1.4.1U

1299
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
It's a new update on the DSI firmware

1300
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Guess what it does?

1301
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Ah yes, it blocks piracy

1302
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
And certain flash carts and all that stuff

1303
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Try to block piracy

1304
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Copying games is bad

1305
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
I get that, but these types of things also block out

1306
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
The homebrew, which is the really fun stuff

1307
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
So anyway the new firmware update

1308
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
On the DSI, it's the first update they've done

1309
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
In about a year, no new functionality

1310
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
It just does quote

1311
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Behind the scenes improvements to system

1312
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Performance, which means

1313
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Some of the flash cartridges that allowed

1314
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
The lead hack source, no longer work

1315
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Some of the affected carts are

1316
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
The ace card 2i, the super card

1317
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
The DS2, the M3i0

1318
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
The iPlayer, and the DSTTI

1319
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
I didn't even know all these things existed

1320
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Did you know about the existence of

1321
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
All these carts? I've never heard of half of these

1322
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Yeah

1323
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
There's a lot of them out there, most people just

1324
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Know the R4

1325
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
Some carts did manage to

1326
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Escape the patch

1327
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
The iSmart DS, the EZ Flash

1328
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
And the Hyper R4

1329
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Ah yes, the R4

1330
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
So there you go

1331
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
It's possible

1332
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
That they will have like you know

1333
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Firmware updates to the actual cards themselves

1334
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
That may re-enable them

1335
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
It's a back and forth game

1336
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
You know

1337
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
I get it, I mean they

1338
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Have, they owe it to their developers

1339
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
And they owe it to themselves to try and

1340
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Stop piracy

1341
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
But it does kind of stink that there isn't at least

1342
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Some type of open channel for homebrew

1343
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
I mean I feel like the only group

1344
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Whatsoever that has somewhat

1345
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Embraced homebrew

1346
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Granted in an ultimately controlled environment

1347
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Is Microsoft and the indie games

1348
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
But even then that's really controlled

1349
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Or even Apple with their app store

1350
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Yeah even though apps have to go through

1351
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Scores and scores of approvals

1352
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
But you know what? There's fart apps galore

1353
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
And all this stupid shit

1354
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Can you imagine if these people were able to

1355
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Program apps for like say

1356
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
The Nintendo DSi

1357
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
I mean it may be a little bit more difficult

1358
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
But

1359
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
It would be really interesting

1360
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
I'm surprised Nintendo's DSi doesn't try to

1361
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Cash in on the app craze

1362
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
And I thought it was to some extent

1363
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
They have the DSi store and so forth

1364
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
They're so behind though

1365
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Open it up to let people make their own things

1366
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Make them charge 99 cents for it

1367
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
And take half

1368
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Well how long did it take them to finally come out with WiiWare

1369
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
I mean seriously

1370
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
They're so behind

1371
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
So I'm not surprised

1372
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
But yeah

1373
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
I'm bummed for the homebrew

1374
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
It's a little harder to feel sympathy

1375
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
For pirates

1376
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
The jig is up kids

1377
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
But for homebrew you're kinda like oh

1378
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Bummer

1379
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
There's also another update to the Wii

1380
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
System firmware as well

1381
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
It's actually still marked as the current firmware

1382
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
But it will remove all the

1383
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Homebrew that you have installed on your system

1384
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
So

1385
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
But does the exploit still work?

1386
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Or did they patch that too?

1387
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
It goes in and takes out all the homebrew

1388
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
They keep patching it and they keep finding ways

1389
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Around it so

1390
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Yes and no I don't know at this point

1391
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Interesting

1392
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
It's not done with Legend of Zelda anymore

1393
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
They can do it easier so

1394
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Well we'll see what firmware is released on a system

1395
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Next week that takes something away

1396
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Without adding anything

1397
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Dark Sakura in the meantime

1398
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
What do you got for us in Other Worlds of Gaming?

1399
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
We're actually having a discussion about food in the chatroom

1400
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
What kind of food? Jewish food

1401
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Rollie pollie fish heads from Jessica Harper

1402
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
That's not food I don't eat fish heads

1403
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Although I did eat something very unique

1404
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
I had herring in sour cream

1405
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Was it good?

1406
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Yeah it actually was

1407
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
But it was

1408
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Very interesting because they expected me to not like it

1409
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Or to make a face at it and I was like

1410
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
This is pretty good I haven't

1411
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Eaten a whole lot of interesting food lately

1412
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
We eat squirrel in Alabama Although

1413
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Alan cooked last night

1414
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
It was really good

1415
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
He did the chicken and his own little breadcrumb thing

1416
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
It was really cute

1417
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
I know

1418
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Now read the story

1419
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Read the damn story

1420
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
That's so cute and gay

1421
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Well

1422
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
For LittleBigPlanet 2

1423
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
There is good news

1424
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
That is if you played a lot of LittleBigPlanet

1425
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
The first

1426
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
And that is

1427
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
The beta invites

1428
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Are going out but it's just for people

1429
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Who are super active in LittleBigPlanet

1430
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
So I guess that they're

1431
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Checking

1432
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
People who create upload

1433
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Who play regularly

1434
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
So here's the major points

1435
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
And also

1436
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
They're not actually out recruiting

1437
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Beta testers

1438
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
They're just sending the invites to people who play the game a lot

1439
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
But some of those points are

1440
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
You have to be 18 years or older

1441
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
And be a resident

1442
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
In a country which we operate

1443
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
If you're reading the direct thing

1444
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Operate the Playstation store

1445
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
The beta will be in English

1446
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
So you have to provide feedback in English

1447
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
And the beta test community

1448
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
And the existing LittleBigPlanet

1449
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Beta testers will automatically

1450
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Be included in the beta trial

1451
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
And it says

1452
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Please note that being selected for this beta

1453
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Does not give you access to other beta

1454
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Trials we may operate

1455
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
The last thing is that participation

1456
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
In the beta trials is subject to their beta

1457
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Trial agreement

1458
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Which I pretty much think means

1459
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Don't go spilling

1460
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
All this crap to other people

1461
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Which is going to happen

1462
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
I think that's a good way to do it

1463
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Because then they'll be

1464
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Giving it to people who understand the mechanics of the game

1465
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
The more that you play something

1466
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Clearly the more you understand it

1467
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
What Rob?

1468
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
You looked funny

1469
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
No I'm reading chat and having fun with them

1470
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
But as far as

1471
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
The way they're doing the beta invites

1472
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
It makes sense, it's cute

1473
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
It's a good way to do it

1474
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
I didn't really get that much into LittleBigPlanet

1475
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
I know I'm not getting invited

1476
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
But why not

1477
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Get your hardcore community in there

1478
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Because they're the ones that are

1479
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
A. Gonna most be shocked by the changes

1480
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
And B. Probably test it the most

1481
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
It makes sense

1482
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
I'm surprised they don't do the same thing with World of Warcraft

1483
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Well maybe that is how they send out the invites

1484
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
There's other ways you can get one

1485
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
I got one, I probably shouldn't have it

1486
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
But I do

1487
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Touch you

1488
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
I actually haven't played it a whole lot

1489
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
A lot is still borked in the World of Warcraft beta

1490
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
What I really want in right now

1491
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Is the DC Universe beta

1492
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
That's what I really want to play right now

1493
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
You're not going to play Star Trek Online

1494
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
You need to give that card to someone who will

1495
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
I'll give it back if you really want it

1496
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
I'll check it out someday

1497
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
You have to play with me

1498
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
In ten days

1499
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
We'll go kill some Borg and smack some Klingons around

1500
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
It'll be fun

1501
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Good times

1502
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
There's got to be at least one other OLR listener that plays Star Trek Online

1503
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
We'll have to hunt down Travis

1504
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Does he?

1505
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
I would play just to attack his ship in the middle of the night

1506
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
You'd have to play a Klingon

1507
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Rob!

1508
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
I think you'd have to play a Klingon

1509
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Really?

1510
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
And that means you'd actually have to level up a character

1511
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
To I think Lieutenant Commander

1512
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
The half Klingon, half human

1513
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
You can sort of make one

1514
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
You get this selection

1515
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
I don't know how we got from Little Big Planet

1516
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Oh, we just broke the show with too much nerdiness

1517
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Oh, that's too bad

1518
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
You get an option to choose

1519
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Alien

1520
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
And then you can customize them however you want them to look

1521
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
I see

1522
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Alright, let's move on Loki

1523
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Well, digital distribution seems to be

1524
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Catching on everywhere else

1525
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
So why not the arcade?

1526
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
I'm just going to at least try it

1527
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
And they've introduced a new digital distribution system

1528
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Called Nesica X Live

1529
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
And this was being shown off

1530
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
At the 48th amusement machine show

1531
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
In Chiba

1532
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
And apparently

1533
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
It will allow arcade operators

1534
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
To purchase cabinets

1535
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
And then download games to the cabinets

1536
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Including a bunch of older titles

1537
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
As well as brand new releases

1538
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
They said that 9 arcade game makers

1539
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Are supporting the platform

1540
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Including SNK

1541
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
And CAVE

1542
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
And the first title release for the system

1543
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Will be none other than Taito's

1544
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
BlazBlue Continuum Shift 2

1545
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
And

1546
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
That's kind of interesting

1547
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
I don't know if they'll ever make it out over here like that

1548
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
I don't see why not

1549
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
I don't know

1550
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
It kind of makes me wonder though

1551
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
I assume this is going to be very similar to

1552
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
How they have the CPS2

1553
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
And 3 systems and stuff like that

1554
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Where it's just a cartridge based

1555
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
System but instead of a cartridge

1556
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
It's going to be a hard drive with

1557
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
A programmer

1558
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Or I guess actually the new Taito system

1559
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Is actually run off of a Windows XP system

1560
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
I just have a feeling

1561
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
These will be easily dumped

1562
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
And stolen because

1563
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Well no seriously if you think about it

1564
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Because it's going to have

1565
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
The same front end

1566
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
That's going to be running all these games

1567
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
And all you're going to be doing is exchanging out

1568
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
The actual

1569
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Game data

1570
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
So if you

1571
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Put out that

1572
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Program

1573
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Then people are going to be able to

1574
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Just dump the game data and all these

1575
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Arcade games will leak

1576
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Despite all this back alley stuff that you're talking about

1577
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
When it comes to this system

1578
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
What do you think of this system as a way to possibly

1579
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Revitalize arcades? I think it's a neat idea

1580
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
It's kind of like taking something from the home

1581
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Consoles that's working well and putting it in arcades

1582
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Haven't we seen this happen to some extent already

1583
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Like a little bit

1584
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Like I know some of the later Bamani games do this

1585
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
With the whole emusment and so forth

1586
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
And I think Technica does the same thing

1587
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
And I even think some of the fighting games are doing this now

1588
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
With some type of digital delivery right?

1589
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
I think it's a good idea in the sense that it will

1590
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Save arcade operators at least

1591
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
If they were to implement this in the states

1592
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
A whole lot of

1593
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Shipping costs because shipping

1594
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Arcade games is not cheap

1595
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
At all and

1596
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Is that first hand?

1597
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Yes somewhat

1598
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
I know that too because I priced

1599
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Trying to get a baby pacman machine

1600
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Because that's how bad I wanted one

1601
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
And honestly the machine itself I could afford

1602
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
It was the shipping that was going to kill me

1603
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
To get one of those machines

1604
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
That's how bad I want that stupid machine

1605
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
A baby pacman?

1606
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
I know

1607
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
I'll track one down for you

1608
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Finding one locally maybe

1609
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
That would be cool

1610
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Shipping is expensive

1611
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
So um

1612
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
I mean granted that they wouldn't be shipping

1613
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
A new cabinet each time

1614
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
They would just be doing a cartridge

1615
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Or something like that

1616
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
If it were any other system

1617
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
But even still

1618
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
That's one less expense

1619
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
They have to deal with

1620
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Although then they have to have internet

1621
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
So maybe it evens itself out

1622
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
But at least when a game is released

1623
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
They can have it there relatively quick

1624
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Because you know if you were overnight

1625
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
A cabinet from you know

1626
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Japan or something like that

1627
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
That would cost millions of dollars

1628
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
That boat would have to go very fast

1629
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
To get the machine over here

1630
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Speed boat

1631
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
You'd have to get Johnny Quest

1632
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
To get that machine out here that fast

1633
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Alright

1634
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Well I think it's a really interesting

1635
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Idea and I could see arcades going that way

1636
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
But is it going to be enough to save them?

1637
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
I don't know

1638
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
No one gives a crap how the games get to the arcade

1639
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
It's just what games are at the arcade

1640
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
What do you think they could do

1641
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
And we have this conversation once in a while

1642
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
On the show and I'll open this up to the chat too

1643
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
What do you think they could do to an arcade

1644
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
To make people come back?

1645
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Give them something that they can't get at home

1646
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
With consoles

1647
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
That's really it

1648
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Right now it's very difficult

1649
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
To come up with that kind of stuff

1650
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Because

1651
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
Lately it's community

1652
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
For the past ten years or so

1653
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
It's the DDR community obviously

1654
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
What this show owes its roots to

1655
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Or fighting game communities

1656
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
You can't readily get that stuff at home

1657
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
You can buy some homemade

1658
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Or really expensive dance pads

1659
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
And stuff

1660
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
But it's still not the same as the arcade

1661
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
But now

1662
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
With Guitar Hero and stuff

1663
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Guitar Freaks is kind of

1664
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
A done deal

1665
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
And the Guitar Hero arcade game

1666
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Is just dumb

1667
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
S2-100 Matt in chat says free blowjobs

1668
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Insert quarter, insert wiener

1669
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
That's not an arcade game

1670
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Okay, that's a peep show

1671
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Free spankings

1672
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Or like an Asian massage parlor

1673
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
That is not an arcade

1674
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Now they put an arcade in

1675
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Was that during the part of the marathon

1676
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
You were here for?

1677
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
I don't think I was here for any part of the marathon

1678
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
I don't remember if it was in the first three hours

1679
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
I think that you were gone

1680
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
But Rob played this funny YouTube video

1681
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
It was Allen

1682
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
The happy ending

1683
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
I'll find it, keep talking

1684
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Get ready to wreck

1685
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
So

1686
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
I don't know if there's a lot they can do to revitalize

1687
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
It's just basically bringing out games that are

1688
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Going to be

1689
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Able to do stuff that you can't

1690
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Really do at home

1691
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
You know the big old gun games

1692
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Just giving people a reason to come to the arcade

1693
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Kind of

1694
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
This is from Mediocre Films on YouTube

1695
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
They get full credit for this

1696
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Mediocre Films is the name of the YouTube here

1697
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
This is called

1698
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Happy ending

1699
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Here you go, Loki

1700
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Link it in the chatroom too

1701
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
You like?

1702
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Ohh

1703
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
She's sitting on his butt

1704
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
I love the generic Asian restaurant music

1705
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
They play in the background

1706
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Don't overplay

1707
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
She just took her dress off

1708
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
You liking this, Loki?

1709
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
Good movie, huh?

1710
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
His head is totally not laying on that right

1711
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
You're not supposed to lay on the little

1712
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Happy ending

1713
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Okay

1714
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Okay

1715
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Happy ending

1716
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
There's like clowns and a juggler

1717
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
And puppets

1718
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
And balloons

1719
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
This is what they need at arcades

1720
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
And they all leave

1721
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
She's clapping

1722
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Are you happy now?

1723
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
It wasn't what I was hoping for

1724
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Oh no

1725
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
Maybe you want a hand jive

1726
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
$50

1727
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
For a

1728
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Hand jive, right?

1729
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Yeah, hand jive

1730
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
Yeah, okay

1731
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Okay

1732
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Hand jive

1733
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Hand jive, hand jive, hand jive, hand jive, hand jive

1734
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Get into hand jive

1735
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Hand jive, hand jive, hand jive, hand jive

1736
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
Like grease

1737
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
See, wasn't that worth derailing the entire show to watch?

1738
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Yes it was

1739
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Wasn't that awesome radio making the listeners

1740
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
Listen to a movie?

1741
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
It's hilarious

1742
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Please show that to Nelly when you get home

1743
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
I will

1744
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
Tell her we send it with love

1745
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Speaking of things that don't make sense

1746
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Just like us playing a video

1747
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
On a radio show

1748
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
The PSP Go

1749
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Did you like that segue?

1750
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
That was an excellent segue

1751
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Kazurai, the PS boss

1752
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Of course

1753
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
This week has admitted

1754
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
In an interview with

1755
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
MCVUK.com

1756
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
That the $250

1757
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Pricing could perhaps

1758
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
Have been the problem

1759
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Behind the sale

1760
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Matter of fact it was a poor design

1761
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
In the first place

1762
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Let me give you the quote here

1763
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
Which Darkcoagackenchat calls the PSP No

1764
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Quote

1765
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
I think we need to make sure we have as many titles

1766
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
Available to download as possible

1767
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
To make the experience as easy as possible

1768
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
But also pricing

1769
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Is perhaps an issue

1770
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
Because of the cost reductions

1771
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
We've been able to do over the years

1772
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
The traditional PSP has benefited

1773
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
But the PSP Go is a completely different design

1774
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
So the cost trend is different

1775
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
So

1776
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
There you go

1777
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
No I don't

1778
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Was maybe pricing the problem with the PSP Go

1779
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
You think possibly

1780
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Perhaps that you put out a skew with

1781
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Less features

1782
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
And then

1783
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
I don't know, offered it for a more

1784
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Expensive price

1785
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
And then I don't know

1786
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Just utterly stopped supporting it

1787
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
Because you know you haven't really

1788
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Released any sort of bundles

1789
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Oh that's because you can't bundle anything with it

1790
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Because it doesn't have a UMD drive

1791
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
To play the games that would be bundled with it

1792
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Ah fun

1793
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
You could give a card for a free download

1794
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Yeah everybody likes cards

1795
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
Dungeon buster in our chat room says

1796
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
Thank you for giving me work to do

1797
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
And I have to go online and download the title

1798
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Dungeon buster in our chat room

1799
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
At chat.orangeslawnsherd.com says

1800
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
I love how Sony spins failure

1801
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
That was a good spin of failure don't you think

1802
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Perhaps, perhaps

1803
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Just maybe

1804
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
It was possibly the fact

1805
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
That the pricing

1806
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Is what ruined it

1807
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
Perhaps

1808
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
I'm not sure

1809
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
We have some analysts we're paying money to look into right now

1810
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
But perhaps

1811
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Let me tell you for free

1812
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
Yes that was the issue

1813
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
It was definitely the pricing

1814
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
Was the issue

1815
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
The pricing for flimsy piece of crap

1816
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:45,000
I saw a PSP go in one of those fancy vending machines the other day

1817
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
It kind of made me laugh a little bit

1818
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Well there was somebody in one of my history classes that had it for class

1819
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
And I said okay you gotta let me see that

1820
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
So I tried playing a little bit

1821
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
That mic is not your friend right now

1822
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
What? I'm holding it together

1823
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
I'm just saying it's cutting in and out

1824
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
I don't write the rules of electronics

1825
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
I just tell you what it is

1826
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
Rob

1827
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
Rob

1828
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
Yes person in your electronics class

1829
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
At any rate

1830
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
I got to play one because a guy in my

1831
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
One of my history classes

1832
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
Was playing one and I said you gotta let me

1833
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Try it and I was like yeah

1834
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Piece of crap

1835
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
I'm sorry you're not going to appreciate this but I know we're talking about

1836
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
The PSP go right now and it really smells like

1837
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
Shermie took a caca like is it just me

1838
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
That smells that

1839
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
She went go

1840
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
I want to see if she really did take

1841
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
She did

1842
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Shermie does not like the

1843
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
PSP go

1844
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
Your cat has

1845
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Impeccable comic timing

1846
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
I just want to say

1847
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
I don't think dark soccer appreciates that

1848
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Shermie

1849
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
Bad kitty

1850
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
I don't think we're allowed to talk about the PSP go anymore

1851
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
Shermie

1852
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
has therefore ended the conversation by

1853
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Taking a dump

1854
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
In the middle of the floor

1855
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
It stinks that dark soccer

1856
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Has the next story so we'll just

1857
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
We'll just sit here and think about that for a moment

1858
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Hi

1859
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
Poopy butt

1860
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
Okay and you want to know

1861
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
I have to say this

1862
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
For the amount of stink that comes out of that cat's ass

1863
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
Her poop

1864
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Her little poop

1865
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Was about the size of an Ikea meatball

1866
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Thank you for that comparison

1867
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Sweetest meatballs will never be the same

1868
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
That means that she couldn't even give

1869
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
A full sized cat crap

1870
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
About the PSP go

1871
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
I love my cat

1872
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
And she's sitting under the pinball table like

1873
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
I did it

1874
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
Her little sassy fat butt

1875
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
So need for speed MMO

1876
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
Have you played it?

1877
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
I haven't

1878
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
He actually really likes it but you can only get up to level 10

1879
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
Before you have to actually pay for it

1880
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
But not anymore

1881
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Because need for speed world

1882
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
Once it hit 1 million registered users

1883
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
It actually is now free to play

1884
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
No more charge

1885
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
But

1886
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
You still have to buy boosts

1887
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
And double XP bonuses and that type of thing

1888
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
So

1889
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
I hate the word

1890
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
The combination microtransaction

1891
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
I just think it's stupid

1892
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
A transaction

1893
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
Is a transaction

1894
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
I'm just saying all those media sites use it

1895
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
It's just kind of one of those things

1896
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
And they're all stupid

1897
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
A transaction is a transaction

1898
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
Oh and it's like the gods above

1899
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
Just pulled the cord on your mic

1900
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Ugh

1901
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
Sony dislikes your comments about their transaction

1902
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
A transaction is a transaction

1903
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
They should just call it

1904
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
Payment

1905
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
You have to pay for this stuff

1906
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
Money is money

1907
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
A little money is still money

1908
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Damn you people

1909
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
So is the game fun? I'm interested in it

1910
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
Dan likes it

1911
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
And he likes doing the

1912
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
Getting the bonuses where you run through

1913
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Police barriers and that type of thing

1914
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
You know

1915
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
It gives you points for

1916
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
How many cops get injured I guess

1917
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
Which is kind of wrong

1918
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
But you know

1919
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
It's actually pretty cool

1920
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
I think they have just a couple of

1921
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Cars that you can pick from right now

1922
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
At least at the level that he's at

1923
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
But it's like playing Need for Speed on the system

1924
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Except you just

1925
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
Truck all over the town on your computer

1926
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
He likes it

1927
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
He says that he would rather play it with a wheel

1928
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Than use the

1929
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
Keyboard like he's been doing

1930
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
The keys gotta stink

1931
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
Maybe a 360 controller would work better though

1932
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
Maybe a little better than the keys

1933
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
Zebun Artarum says you guys gotta get a new mic

1934
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
I think, I hope it's not the mic

1935
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
That's the newest mic in the studio

1936
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
It's probably the cord, not the mic

1937
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Something maybe happened where the mic fell

1938
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Or something and shorted

1939
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
One of the wires, I don't know

1940
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
It slides out just a little bit

1941
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
I think that I just need to get a new mic cable

1942
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
Yeah, hopefully that's it

1943
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Or we could take the mic cable from a working mic

1944
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
That might be the solution

1945
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
That one's not detachable

1946
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
Yeah it is, at the bottom

1947
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
Maybe we could try that during the break and see if that works

1948
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
I can hold it

1949
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
I can hold it, I'm a big girl

1950
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
Let's travel around the world

1951
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
And look at some release dates

1952
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
And what's coming to a console near you

1953
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
We'll start in the USA

1954
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Loki?

1955
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
Well, there's some things

1956
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
Coming out this week

1957
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
I'm sure there's something big

1958
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
I just can't remember what it was called

1959
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
Oh yeah, Halo Reach

1960
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
That's right, that's out this week on

1961
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
The Xbox 360

1962
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
Well here's everything else

1963
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
That doesn't really matter

1964
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
Professor Layton and the Unwound Future comes out today

1965
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
That's on the DS

1966
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
Dawn of Heroes coming out

1967
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
On the DS as well this week

1968
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
Deal or No Deal Special Edition

1969
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
What's special about it?

1970
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
Well they updated some of the games so it's more like the TV show is now

1971
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
Other than that it's not that special

1972
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
That will be out on the Wii this week as well

1973
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
Deer Drive on the Nintendo DS

1974
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
Now you can hunt deer on your DS

1975
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
That's exciting I guess

1976
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
Damn deer

1977
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
Damn you deer

1978
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
Painkiller Pandemonium

1979
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
On PC out this week

1980
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
Fancy Nancy

1981
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
Is that like Rush Limbaugh

1982
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
And other you know

1983
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Pill addicted celebrities

1984
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
Doom clone

1985
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Fancy Nancy Tea Party Time

1986
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
On the DS

1987
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
Really? Really

1988
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
Can you say that one more time?

1989
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
Fancy Nancy Tea Party Time

1990
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
Fancy Nancy Tea Party Time

1991
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
What the hell do you do in Fancy Nancy Tea Party Time

1992
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
Well I'm glad you asked

1993
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Well let's see

1994
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
Fancy Nancy Tea Party Time

1995
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
Is so awesome that it doesn't deserve

1996
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
Either a high res box shot

1997
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Or a synopsis

1998
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
But if I want to remember I believe that you have to

1999
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
Oh they're about books

2000
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
Hold on there's a trailer here

2001
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
Let's see Fancy Nancy Tea Party Time

2002
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
Let's look here at a trailer

2003
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
Again watching Netflix

2004
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
With the radio listeners

2005
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
Always a good time

2006
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
Let's see here

2007
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
She is pretty Nancy

2008
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
In five short years

2009
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
Fancy Nancy has enchanted the hearts

2010
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
And wardrobes of girls all over the world

2011
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
With over 25 books

2012
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
And more than 10 million copies sold

2013
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
Nancy adorned the New York Times

2014
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
Best seller list for over 200 weeks

2015
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
So far no mention of a video game

2016
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
Just saying

2017
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
I wouldn't let my girl read that

2018
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
And the party is just getting started

2019
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
Would you let your girl read Twilight?

2020
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
Hell no

2021
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
Do you enjoy being glamorous

2022
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
Extravagant

2023
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
And posh

2024
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
But she could be glamorous, extravagant

2025
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
And posh

2026
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
I would rather her be intelligent

2027
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
Confident

2028
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
And not having to conform to anything like that

2029
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
This gash is for you

2030
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
Fancy Nancy Tea Party Time

2031

01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
You plan the party

2037
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
Collect the supplies

2038
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
Choose her time

2039
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
Hold on wait I'm trying to look at some of the dialogue there

2040
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
Hurray I found a tea set

2041
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
I bet it's terrific

2042
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
Well if you're going to throw a tea party

2043
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
It better damn be terrific

2044
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
You're fired

2045
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
Travel the neighborhood and put the party pieces together

2046
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
For the most fabulous

2047
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000

Most spectacular

2049
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Soiree you can create

2050
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
It is fabulous decor and accessories

2051
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
A plethora of puzzles

2052
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
This trailer goes on way too long

2053
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000

01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
An abundance of fun

2057
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
Fancy Nancy

2058
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
Now on your Nintendo DS and DSi

2059
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000

2061
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
Fancy Nancy's Tea Party

2062
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
We should send out an invite on Facebook

2063
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
No

2064
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
I will not

2065
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
Yeah so that's on DS

2066
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
Gamer girl in chat says

2067
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
The tea is laced with marijuana

2068
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
Now that's a game I'd play

2069
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Maui Wowie's Tea Party

2070
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
Frisbee says Fancy Nancy

2071
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
In the meth lab

2072
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
If you feel like killing something

2073
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
After hearing that trailer

2074
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
Cabela's North American Adventure will be out on

2075
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Xbox 360, Playstation 3

2076
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
Wii and

2077
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
PSP maybe the DS

2078
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
I don't know

2079
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
It's out on a lot of systems

2080
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
You hunt stuff, everybody loves it

2081
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
Salacious Pop wants to know if Fancy Nancy

2082
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
Fuck Joe Man is coming out for Xbox Live Arcade

2083
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
Dark Tattoo says

2084
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Harold and Kumar's Tea Party

2085
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Scooby Doo and the

2086
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
Spooky Swamp out on the Wii

2087
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
And the DS

2088
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
And I believe the PSP

2089
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
Maybe the Playstation 2

2090
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
Who cares, it sucks

2091
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
Frisbee's suggesting Fancy Nancy in the meth lab

2092
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
That's what I said

2093
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
That's what she's really gathering the supplies for

2094
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
I thought you said Dark Tattoo, sorry

2095
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
Truth or Lies

2096
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
It's a game

2097
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
On the PS3, Xbox 360

2098
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
And the Wii

2099
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
You

2100
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
Are challenged to

2101
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
Lie to your friends I guess

2102
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
I don't really know what the hell the point of this is

2103
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
Bring the party into your living room

2104
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
Inspire hilarious discussions and learn about your friends

2105
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
As deep dark

2106
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
Secrets are revealed

2107
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
It's time to uncover who is telling the truth

2108
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
And who is flat out lying

2109
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
I'm guessing that it has some sort of way to tell

2110
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
If you're a liar or not

2111
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
Maybe, otherwise this game is lame

2112
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:57,000
AkumaJP suggests Fancy Nancy's happy ending

2113
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
Fancy Nancy's hand job

2114
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
Or Fancy Hand Job I guess

2115
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Legends of the Guardian

2116
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000

2117
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000

Wii and DS this week

2119
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
That tie in with the brand new animated movie

2120
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Finish in Ferb

2121
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
Right again on the DS

2122
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
If you like that cartoon series I guess

2123
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
Dark Sacros is like yelling for the other room

2124
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
What?

2125
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
I freaking love Phineas and Ferb

2126
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
That show is crack

2127
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
I would play a game

2128
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
And she has

2129
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
Sipped the

2130
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
Disney Kool-Aid

2131
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
Racket Sports coming out on

2132
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
Playstation 3 this week

2133
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
This is very similar to the game

2134
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
That was out on the Wii

2135
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
It's like Wii Sports

2136
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
Lord of the Rings

2137
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
Aragorn's quest on the

2138
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Playstation 2, the PS3

2139
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
The Wii, the DS and the

2140
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
PSP, of course the PS3 version

2141
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
Works with the Playstation Move

2142
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
And is equally lame

2143
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
Gladiator begins

2144
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
Not a prequel to the

2145
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
Gladiator movie but it is

2146
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
A gladiator combat game

2147
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
There are a lot of games I don't care about

2148
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
Coming out this week

2149
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
Me too and I'm covering all of them

2150
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
Alpha and Omega

2151
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
Alpha and Omega, it's a DS game

2152
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
Whatever, and Jesus

2153
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
US release has been going on for like an hour

2154
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Halo Reach comes out this week

2155
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
Hey

2156
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
Halo Reach is a mature game

2157
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
There are a lot of mature

2158
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
Chatters, chat room

2159
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000

I will have you know that this is the second time that a Halo game

2163
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
Has come out against Cabela's

2164
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
Maybe this year Cabela's will take it

2165
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
Oh

2166
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
Anyways

2167
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
Oh and Cabela's

2168
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
Did have a version with a gun for the Wii

2169
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
Alright I'm almost done

2170
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
Gourmet D the Lords of

2171
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
Nature coming from Konami on the Wii and

2172
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
The DS, I don't even know what that is nor do I care

2173
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
Yu-Gi-Oh

2174
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
50's dual

2175
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
Transfer on the Wii

2176
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
Yay

2177
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
Of course the Halo Reach will be out in the

2178
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
Legendary and Limited Editions as well

2179
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
A game called Swords on the Wii

2180
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
Wonder what you do in that

2181
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
That's a

2182
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
That's a tough one there

2183
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
Let me give you the results

2184
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
Of our quick poll

2185
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
Fancy Nancy or Halo Reach, you ready?

2186
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
Fancy Nancy Milthouse

2187
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
Fancy Nancy goes to the strip club

2188
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
Halo Reach, Fancy Nancy, Reach

2189
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
Fancy Nancy, Reach, this is sad

2190
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
It's split 50-50

2191
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
Fancy Halo Reach, Fancy Nancy

2192
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
Reach around, I'd much rather have

2193
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
Fancy Nancy, Reach

2194
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
Fancy Nancy download content for

2195
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
Halo Reach, I almost said Hello Reach

2196
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
Fancy Nancy, Reach

2197
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
Fancy Nancy's pap smear

2198
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
Fancy Nancy please

2199
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
More like Halo Reach around

2200
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
Etc, etc, it's half and half

2201
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
I don't know what to think about that

2202
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
Well

2203
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
I don't know, and two last things

2204
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
The Fantasy Star Portable on the PSP

2205
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
And finally, it's not really a game

2206
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
But it's coming out this week, the PlayStation Move

2207
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
And all the wonderful components for that

2208
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
And

2209
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
A goddamn thing on this website

2210
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
Says that, you know

2211
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
There's stupid

2212
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
Sports champions

2213
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
Or whatever game

2214
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
Is out, despite the douchebag

2215
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
And the GameStop saying

2216
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
Well it doesn't come out until the 17th

2217
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
Yeah the bundle doesn't come out until the 17th

2218
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
You idiot

2219
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Are you done? Are you finished?

2220
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
Are you finished? Are you sure?

2221
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
Hey, going to Japan

2222
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
And looking at what's coming out, the Japanese release dates

2223
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
Yay

2224
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
Halo Reach also comes out in Japan this week

2225
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
On September the 15th, front mission evolved

2226
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
September the 16th

2227
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
In Japan, those are both on, of course on the Xbox 360

2228
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
Moving on over to the

2229
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
PlayStation 3

2230
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
See I don't know, is

2231
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
Halo Reach as big of a deal overseas as it is here

2232
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
I would think

2233
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
It's still like

2234
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
It's like a B game

2235
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
It's up there but not like way up there

2236
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
PlayStation 3, front mission evolved

2237
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
Is there as well

2238
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
As well as Mobile Suit Gundam Senkai

2239
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
Record UC 0081

2240
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
That's just a price reduction though

2241
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
That game's actually already been out

2242
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Moving over to the Nintendo Wii and seeing what

2243
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
Glorious games they're getting over there in Japan

2244
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
Let's see

2245
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
Deca Sports 3 is this week

2246
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
Wii to Sports 10

2247
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
Shimoku comes out this week in the pretty popular

2248
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
Deca Sports series, that series does pretty well for Hudson

2249
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
Doesn't it?

2250
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
It's like Wii Sports never dies

2251
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
Nothing really notable on the PlayStation 2

2252
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
But I do have the Nintendo DS

2253
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
Jinsai Game QDS

2254
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
Heisei no Dekigoto

2255
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
That is also a price reduction that's moving into the best

2256
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
Otherwise not a lot of new games this week

2257
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
Although on the 18th, there's all these

2258
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
Like new covers coming out

2259
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
If you want to get covers for your

2260
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
DSI in different colors, you have that to look forward to

2261
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
Ooh, this ought to be good though

2262
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
On the Sony PSP, here's a big week

2263
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's Tag Force 5

2264
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
Cause I know there's some Closet Yu-Gi-Oh! fans out there

2265
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:11,000
Dissida Final Fantasy Universal Tuning is ultimate hits

2266
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
So Square sometimes does this with their games

2267
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
They put out kind of like an international version later on

2268
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
I'm assuming it's kind of this version of this

2269
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
Also a game called Blue Roses

2270
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:27,000
Yosai to Aoi Hitomi no Senshi Tashi comes out this week

2271
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
Oh, I think that's uh, hold on

2272
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
It's Blue Roses

2273
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
It's a strategy game

2274
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
I was looking at the title

2275
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
Oh sorry, it's an RPG pretty much

2276
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:41,000
This game's from Nippon Ichi Entertainment

2277
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
Who makes a lot of the games

2278
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
Just looks like your typical Japanese RPG honestly

2279
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
With your little anime cutscenes

2280
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
It looks cute, looks cute

2281
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
I'm sure there'll be some people that want to import that

2282
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
That's it for Japanese releases

2283
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
How about The Old Kingdom?

2284
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
Oh, we have a number of things over there

2285
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
Taylor Reach, and then Legend of the Guardians

2286
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
The Owls of Gahool

2287
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
Oh, that's not from that book

2288
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
That was that movie, right?

2289
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
A book and a movie, yeah

2290
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
There's Scooby-Doo and the Spooky Swamp

2291
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
Final Fantasy Tactics

2292
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
The War of the Lions on iPhone

2293
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
Sounds fun

2294
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
Flight Control, Kung Fu Rider

2295
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
and PlayStation Move on the 15th

2296
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
As well as also on the 15th

2297
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
Sonic Adventure for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3

2298
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
And Sports Champions

2299
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
And Start the Party

2300
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
And closing up the week

2301
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
On the 17th we have Lionheart

2302
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
King's Crusade on PC

2303
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
R.U.S.E

2304
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
And Two Worlds 2

2305
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
Of course, there's a game coming out next week

2306
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
That totally makes me laugh by the name Deathspank

2307
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
That's funny

2308
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
Nice

2309
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
Quick question from your chatroom

2310
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
Spyro's asking, what about Final Fantasy 14?

2311
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:53,000
I believe it's out in two weeks on the PC

2312
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
At the end of the month

2313
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
Yeah, and my list for Japanese releases doesn't cover the PC

2314
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
So I'm not sure when it's coming out of there

2315
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
PlayStation 3 is not until next year

2316
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
And I think that's the same

2317
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
Be it Japan or the U.S.

2318
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
I think PC is getting the first crack at that

2319
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
And Collector's Edition is what, the 22nd?

2320
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
I think regular people get in on the 30th

2321
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:15,000
I'm a little skeptical about Final Fantasy 14

2322
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
I don't know, I'm weird though

2323
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
I feel like I need to buy it

2324
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:23,000
I need to give the retail game a good old fashioned college try

2325
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
I need to try it

2326
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
And see what I really think of it

2327
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:31,000
But then again, I'm like, oh wow, but that beta was so bad

2328
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
But I don't know

2329
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
I'm really torn, that's where I'm at

2330
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
We'll see, to be continued

2331
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:41,000
It really depends, probably like, do I have money to spend on Final Fantasy 14 or not

2332
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
That's really what it's going to come down to, probably

2333
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:47,000
Alright, let's move on with some other news

2334
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
We're going to talk to Game of the Week here in just a little bit

2335
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
Here on the show, Loki

2336
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
Ah yes, so

2337
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
It's kind of interesting

2338
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
For the longest time I remember

2339
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
Apple was so

2340
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
Adamant about not

2341
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
Supporting Flash in

2342
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
Their applications, well

2343
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
That may change soon actually

2344
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
They're going to relax some of the

2345
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
IOS

2346
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
Development restrictions

2347
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
Including the

2348
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
Use now of third party

2349
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
Tools like Flash CS5

2350
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
So apparently

2351
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
New apps now can be developed with that in mind

2352
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
That's kind of cool

2353
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
So maybe

2354
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
I don't know, we'll get some more apps that way

2355
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
Maybe a better web browser

2356
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
Does that mean it's easier to make apps now

2357
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
Because people have been asking for an

2358
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
OLR app for forever

2359
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
I'm kind of like, I don't know

2360
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
Flash I guess

2361
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
I don't know what to put in an OLR app

2362
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
Did it ever get put back in the store though?

2363
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
I heard that it was gone from the store

2364
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
For a little while, I don't know if it ever came back

2365
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
I don't know. What else would be on an OLR app

2366
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
That's not already on the all games app

2367
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
I don't know. I can think of a few things

2368
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
I know one of the other shows I've seen

2369
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
Out there does like special shows

2370
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
That you get if you buy the app

2371
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
But I don't know

2372
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
I don't know how I feel about that. We're too lazy for that

2373
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
Yeah, and it's always kind of been like, you know, we've always put

2374
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
Everything out there for free, I would feel bad to suddenly

2375
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
Make, like if we're going to make people pay for things

2376
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
We need to get those stupid shirts done

2377
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
Or something like, you know, something really really extra

2378
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
Beyond audio and video content

2379
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
Which we've always done for free, you know

2380
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
Not dogging on other shows

2381
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
I, you know, everybody's got to

2382
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
Pay the bills somehow, it's just, you know

2383
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
We've never really made money off this show

2384
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
And I don't think we're ever going to

2385
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
And that's fine. It is what it is

2386
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
Darktide Studio suggesting an

2387
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
OLR and a USL combined soundboard

2388
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
Now, okay, now that

2389
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
I could, that's something a little extra

2390
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
Perhaps, perhaps, we'll see

2391
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
Alright, moving on

2392
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
Let's see, oh, I like this

2393
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
Oh, and Tigerclaw confirms the All Games app

2394
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
Is still not back on the App Store

2395
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
Well, maybe we need to put an app up there

2396
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
Just so that there's something to tune into the radio show

2397
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
On the go, I don't know, although I think Video Game

2398
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
Outsiders have one

2399
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
And that show's plenty fine, I like what they do over there

2400
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
Mario

2401
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
It's a hacky Mario game

2402
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
Not really, more like a homebrew Mario game

2403
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
It's created by Ben Weber

2404
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
He's a candidate for his PhD in computer science

2405
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
He goes to UC Santa Cruz

2406
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
He's programmed a game

2407
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
And it uses sprites from Super Mario World

2408
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
So you could say it's homebrew

2409
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
But what this game does is it's called

2410
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
Infinite Adaptive Mario

2411
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
And the level starts with

2412
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
Moderate difficulty

2413
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
But once you beat that, the next level gets harder

2414
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
And gets harder and harder

2415
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
Until you die three times in a row

2416
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
Without completing a level

2417
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
When it gets easier

2418
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
And by the way, harder means yes, it gets

2419
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
A lot harder

2420
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
According to Weber, Infinite Adaptive Mario

2421
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
Scales up difficulty by increasing

2422
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
The frequency of gaps

2423
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
Average size of gaps, variation of ground height

2424
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
And a number of enemies

2425
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
So in other words, as you get

2426
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
Smarter, so does the game

2427
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
And in some cases

2428
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
If you look at some of these screenshots

2429
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
There's like 16 monsters on the screen at once

2430
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
Including piranha plants

2431
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
That just fly in mid-air

2432
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
That seems really hard

2433
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
That looks crazy, I was looking at it

2434
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
The author put Infinite Adaptive Mario

2435
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
Up against an AI program

2436
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
That completes randomly generated Mario levels

2437
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
And there's this whole YouTube

2438
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
On how that goes

2439
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
That sounds kind of interesting actually

2440
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
You can download it on

2441
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
The website for UC Santa Cruz

2442
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
But it is a little bit buggy

2443
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
But that's kind of interesting

2444
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
Although, I kind of think

2445
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
Hasn't Nintendo gone that direction

2446
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
A little bit, like games don't get

2447
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
Harder necessarily, but didn't they put in

2448
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
That controversial quote unquote system

2449
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
A little while back where the levels get

2450
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
Easier, or I guess the tutorials

2451
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
Luigi tutorials come up if you're

2452
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
Screwing up, like wasn't that in the Mario

2453
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
Versus game, the new Super Mario Brothers

2454
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
Wii, if you die like 8 times

2455
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
In a level then you get the Luigi tutorial

2456
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
Kind of interesting huh?

2457
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
That's the, you suck

2458
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
So we're going to teach you not to suck

2459
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
Exactly

2460
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
Uh, Loki you're playing that right now

2461
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
I see you, I see you over there

2462
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
You're playing it right now aren't you

2463
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
I think he is, I was going to yeah

2464
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
Except they don't tell you what the buttons are

2465
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
Which makes it difficult, oh that might be kind of difficult

2466
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
Alright hey uh

2467
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
Let's get to the classic

2468
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
Game of the week, it's a segment here on the show

2469
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
Where we take a trip down memory lane

2470
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
With the help of Dark Sakura and her gaming vault

2471
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
To say hey

2472
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
Here's a video game you little brats

2473
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
Should be playing this week

2474
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
And it's not Mario this week unfortunately

2475
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
It's not related to this, but it is pretty cool right

2476
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
Dark Sakura, Ice Cream Man

2477
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
Oh yeah the Ice Cream Man

2478
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
The Ice Cream Man's outside, I can't do the segment bye

2479
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
No I'm kidding

2480
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
Okay

2481
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
Yes the classic game of the week is

2482
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
Moonwalker

2483
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
Specifically Michael Jackson's Moonwalker

2484
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
Cause you know not to be confused with

2485
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
Paula Abdul's Moonwalker

2486
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
I'm going to start off on the arcade version

2487
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
Cause the arcade version is

2488
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
It's been hard to find lately

2489
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
And it's different of course than the one we all remember on the Genesis

2490
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
Which I think is pretty cool

2491
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
Um

2492
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
At any rate going with the arcade version

2493
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
Um

2494
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
You start off on sort of uh

2495
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
It's technically side scrolling

2496
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
But it goes

2497
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
Diagonally

2498
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
And you uh

2499
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
It is a beat em up, you have magic powers

2500
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
To attack with instead of actually just punching them

2501
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
And you can shoot magic at them

2502
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
And uh

2503
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
You can also turn into the big robot

2504
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
From uh

2505
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
Which is the best thing ever

2506
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
Yeah

2507
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
And um

2508
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
The player one is Michael in the white suit and hat

2509
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
And then with the blue shirt

2510
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
And then second player is

2511
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
Red with white

2512
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
And the third one is black with red

2513
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
And they have those armands

2514
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
You know that Michael Jackson is going to be really fond of

2515
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
Um

2516
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
Did you hear Michael's little scream there in between stages?

2517
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
Wow

2518
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
Hold on one more time

2519
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
He saves the kid, he goes in the door

2520
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
And then there's a cut scene

2521
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
Round 2

2522
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
Amusement quarter

2523
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
Here we go, here we go

2524
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
Wow

2525
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
Although I love this little version of Smooth Criminal

2526
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
That plays in the background

2527
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
Let's listen to a little bit of it

2528
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
Anyway

2529
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
Um, of course he's got the uh

2530
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
The dance magic

2531
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
Which um, is sort of I guess

2532
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
The smart bomb for the game

2533
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,000
And uh

2534
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
Basically um

2535
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
You all get this sort of on screen

2536
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
Logo

2537
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
That you can activate it and then a spotlight lands

2538
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
On you and you start to dance

2539
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
Like regular

2540
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
Michael Jackson moves

2541
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
And then all the enemies on the screen start dancing

2542
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
With you

2543
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
And then they pass out because they

2544
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
Can't keep up with Michael Jackson's

2545
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
Smooth moves

2546
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
Um, but it doesn't um

2547
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
The bosses don't dance

2548
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
They just take a lot of damage

2549
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
And on screen children are not harmed of course

2550
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
Michael has to rescue the kids

2551
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
And then um

2552
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
One of his power ups is Bubbles the Champion Z

2553
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
And Bubbles

2554
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
Is in each level and every time

2555
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
You rescue

2556
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
Rescue him he turns you into the giant robot

2557
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
And then you can shoot lasers

2558
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
Now

2559
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
For the console

2560
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
Of course this is what I'm sure people remember a lot

2561
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
More of is uh

2562
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
The one that came out on the Genesis

2563
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,000
And

2564
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
I like this one

2565
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
Because when you go and do the dance magic thing

2566
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
When you're standing on the piano everyone does the whole

2567
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
Smooth criminal dance and that was just sweet

2568
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
But that one was

2569
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
Pretty cool and to go back to the

2570
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
The uh songs that were in the game

2571
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
For the arcade version the cavern one was bad

2572
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
And the amusement quarter is smooth criminal

2573
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
The night street is beat it

2574
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
Graveyard is another part of me

2575
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
And the evil fortress is uh

2576
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
Another version of bad and then Billy Jean

2577
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
Plays in the credits

2578
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
And then on the Sega Genesis one

2579
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
Which is more standard side scroller

2580
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
Uh the stage one

2581
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
Is smooth criminal

2582
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
Stage two is beat it, stage three is another

2583
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
Part of me, stage four is Billy Jean

2584
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
And then you can perform like part of bad

2585
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
And then stage five is bad with your special

2586
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
Performance being smooth criminal beat it

2587
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
Thriller if you have the REV-00

2588
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
Version

2589
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
Or another part of me which is the

2590
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
REV-01

2591
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
And uh he shouts

2592
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
Woo

2593
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
And in some of the cut scenes he says

2594
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
Who's bad?

2595
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,000
But he says his usual

2596
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
Little catch phrases

2597
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
And then um

2598
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
But for the ad for the

2599
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
Sega Genesis version it

2600
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
Said that thriller was supposed to be

2601
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
In the game but

2602
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
It wasn't it's just the dance

2603
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
Attack that's in

2604
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
That one version in the

2605
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
Last stage

2606
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
Of course this isn't the only

2607
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
Game that Michael Jackson has made appearances in

2608
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
Uh there there was you know

2609
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
Space channel five and space channel five part two

2610
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
And he was a secret character and ready

2611
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
To rumble boxing round two

2612
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
So uh

2613
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
That's pretty cool

2614
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
But there was um

2615
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
Also uh

2616
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
Did you know that they were

2617
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
Working on Michael Jackson

2618
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
The experience game to be out on

2619
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
Xbox 360? Yes it's um

2620
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,000
Coming out it was gonna be out later this year

2621
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
But I think it got pushed back next year now

2622
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
It better be just like Moonwalker

2623
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
I think it's supposed to be just like

2624
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
Just dance

2625
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
And singing in it

2626
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
The game actually has

2627
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
A rating on for

2628
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
The PEGI has a rating for Wii's

2629
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
Virtual console so

2630
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
There's a talk that it should be out um

2631
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
In Europe

2632
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
So that's pretty cool

2633
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
Cool game

2634
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
Alright I don't care if people say it sucks

2635
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
I completely disagree

2636
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
No it was a cool arcade game

2637
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
On the Genesis it was a little wonky but it was

2638
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
You know it was Michael Jackson

2639
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
It's all about the dance

2640
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
But the best Michael Jackson game is space channel five part two

2641
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
Oh yeah

2642
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
Especially when you break out into the whole thriller dance

2643
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
Oh that was awesome

2644
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000
Alright there it is your classic game of the week

2645
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
Michael Jackson's Moonwalker for the arcade

2646
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
Although Dark Soccer did reference the Genesis version as well

2647
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
So that's gonna do it for part A of our

2648
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
Program but it's not over yet guys

2649
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
We got plenty more show to come

2650
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000
Your phone calls, your emails, rapid fire news

2651
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
And the tweets on Twitter

2652
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
Talk of Guitar Hero invading the Twitters

2653
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
And Rock Band 3 information

2654
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
And a new character confirmed for Marvel vs

2655
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
Capcom 3 this week

2656
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
We're gonna talk about all of that when we come right back with more

2657
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
Of Orange Lounge Radio

2658
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio

2659
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
It is episode number 381

2660
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
Live on this Sunday evening

2661
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
September the 12th of 2010

2662
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
We are live of course at All Games Radio

2663
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
Where we do tape our show live every Sunday night

2664
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
At 6 o'clock Pacific

2665
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
9 o'clock Eastern right after

2666
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
The Bobby Black Wolf show

2667
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
Although next week he's not gonna be here

2668
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
Sad

2669
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
So it'll just be us next Sunday holding down the fort

2670
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
But you know what that means

2671
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
We can take over the stream early if we want

2672
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
We can take over the stream early

2673
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
And then go to bed early

2674
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
Bobby assured me that there's no best of

2675
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
Or anything next week so

2676
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
And the chatters are requesting another marathon

2677
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
Okay

2678
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
No, are you crazy?

2679
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
We're not doing another marathon

2680
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
I'll go live early though

2681
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
I'll go live early

2682
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
You can do a marathon, you can broadcast all day long

2683
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
And then I'll come in at 6 o'clock

2684
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
As will Loki

2685
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
Alan may be here next week I'm not sure

2686
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
Okay

2687
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
Coming in right in the middle of the rebirth

2688
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
Of Pump Up the Volume

2689
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
Good times

2690
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
Maybe

2691
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
On our Twitter

2692
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
Run my dear

2693
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
They're already asking for an OLR-thon too

2694
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
Too much

2695
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
If you do it too much then it loses its effect

2696
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
It needs to stay like a once a year type of thing

2697
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
Of course then again this show as it is

2698
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
Has already been going what 8 and a half years

2699
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
So if we even make it another year that in itself

2700
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
Is something to celebrate so that'll be good

2701
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
Think we'll make it to 10 years? That's a long time

2702
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
That'll be good Why not?

2703
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
It's only 2 more years

2704
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
Not even 2 more whole years

2705
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
We might make it to 10 years

2706
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
You have coffee?

2707
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
Nescafe do you want some? Is it decaf?

2708
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
Yes

2709
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
It's good Alright I'll try some

2710
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
Fine I don't have any creamer to put in

2711
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
Except for rice milk

2712
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
I don't know if I have any left

2713
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,000
Sure why not if you're offering

2714
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
Woot I'm getting coffee

2715
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
And you're getting rapid fire news

2716
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
Quick stories that uh

2717
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
We didn't fit anywhere else in the show

2718
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
Loki

2719
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
Walmart has a listing for an eco

2720
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
Shadow of the Colossus

2721
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
Kind of a

2722
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
Classic I don't know if you call it

2723
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
Rema HD compilation

2724
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
That's gonna be on the Playstation 3

2725
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
Um

2726
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
I could see that happening

2727
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
And I doubt that they would make up stuff so

2728
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
It's possible

2729
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
I bet we'd see it come out around the same time

2730
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
As The Last Guardian so um

2731
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
They may be jumping the gun

2732
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
A little bit though

2733
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
But at least that's on there right now

2734
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
Other news

2735
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
There is rumors that Frank

2736
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
West may be in

2737
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
Dead Rising 2 as well

2738
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
And this is coming from the

2739
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
Kind of a teaser site

2740
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
I guess it's a little bit viral

2741
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
Called tape it or die

2742
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
Um

2743
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
Where apparently they have uh

2744
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
Some fictional characters Johnny Pipes

2745
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
Uh recounts seeing someone

2746
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,000
else fighting by green side

2747
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
So I go after him he says

2748
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
Um but then I see some other dude

2749
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
Uh vaguely recognized him

2750
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
Maybe saw him at a party a few years back

2751
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
Maybe a celebrity can't remember his name though

2752
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
Phil Floyd regardless

2753
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
He was fighting zombies

2754
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
Um too it was like Oktoberfest

2755
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
But replaced the beer with zombies

2756
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
And drinking with slaughter

2757
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
It was like I died and gone to heaven

2758
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
Um

2759
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
And of course I believe in one of the

2760
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
Screenshots where they have these like

2761
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
Photos or whatever um

2762
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
I thought I saw Frank West actually in there

2763
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
Yes he is actually in that

2764
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
Photo so

2765
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
I think it's inevitable he has to make a cameo

2766
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
Somewhere in the game you know what I mean

2767
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
Like he's gotta be in it or people are just gonna be

2768
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
Pissed

2769
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
And also there's two player co-op

2770
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
Oh they haven't said what the second player is?

2771
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
Nope

2772
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
In the demos it's been just you played another

2773
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
Chuck Green but

2774
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
Perhaps Frank West

2775
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
Perhaps they'll charge you 500 points as DLC

2776
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
Perhaps they will have like a second

2777
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
The second quest

2778
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,000
As you like to put it

2779
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,000
Where you can play as Frank West

2780
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,000
I think more games need

2781
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
Second quests

2782
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
Like the original Legend of Zelda

2783
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
Wow that's a hot cup

2784
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
Um

2785
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
Console modder Ben Heck

2786
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
Is getting his own show starting

2787
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
September 13th

2788
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,000
You may remember him from

2789
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
Such wonderful console mods

2790
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,000
As the Atari 2600

2791
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,000
Portable

2792
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
And all the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3

2793
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
Laptops he's made

2794
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
He does a lot of modding for different

2795
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,000
Game controllers and what not

2796
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
But he will have his own show

2797
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
Appear on apparently

2798
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
An internet TV channel called

2799
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
Revision 3

2800
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,000
And I guess

2801
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,000
The one that does all the dig shows

2802
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
Maybe and it's also

2803
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
Gonna be hosted on Element 14

2804
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
So

2805
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
It's interesting

2806
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
Will it be on actual television?

2807
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
Don't know, should though

2808
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
It'll be on Apple TV

2809
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
That's where it'll be

2810
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:09,000
Did the cat poop again?

2811
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
DarkSakura just found a surprise

2812
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
Aw poor thing

2813
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
Any other quick stories

2814
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
Loki, or should I move on here

2815
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
Ah that's all I have

2816
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
How about something about Final Fantasy

2817
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
Dissida, you know a lot of you guys are really big fans of this game

2818
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
It was pretty cool little

2819
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
Final Fantasy fighting game

2820
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
Well they've just announced

2821
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
Dissida Duodecim

2822
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
I guess is how you pronounce this

2823
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
It's all Latiney words

2824
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
Yes it is in the issue of Shonen Jump

2825
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
Which is one of those magazines overseas

2826
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,000
It's a sequel to Dissida Final Fantasy

2827
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,000
It'll be coming out on Japanese PSPs

2828
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
In 2011

2829
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,000
Dissida Duodecim Final Fantasy

2830
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
We don't know any new characters yet

2831
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
Except for Final Fantasy 4's

2832
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
Kane and Final Fantasy 13's

2833
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
Lightning

2834
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:01,000
That'll be cool, no other players have been confirmed

2835
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,000
Yet, but I imagine most of the roster

2836
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000
From the first Dissida game

2837
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,000
I know a lot of my friends are big fans of this game

2838
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,000
So I'm sure they're going to be excited about that

2839
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,000
More news on that when we know it

2840
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,000
Meanwhile, for you Mac gamers

2841
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
And I know there are some of you

2842
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,000
You missed out on Grand Theft Auto 3

2843
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,000
When it was the shit

2844
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
Well miss out on this no more

2845
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
Grand Theft Auto 3, Vice City, and San Andreas

2846
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,000
A big pack of games is coming out later this year

2847
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,000
That is confirmed from Rockstar's

2848
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,000
Facebook for the Mac

2849
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
I don't have a date yet or anything like that

2850
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
But for you Mac gamers who missed out on that

2851
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
I'm sure you're excited

2852
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,000
And I know Dark Soccer is going to be first in line

2853
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,000
For one of these on September 21st

2854
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,000
For the low low price of $54.99

2855
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
A pink

2856
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
DualShock 3

2857
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
Yay!

2858
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,000
How do you like that?

2859
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,000
I think I like cleaning up Shermie's poop better

2860
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,000
Actually, I'll tell you something really cool

2861
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,000
Let's listen to another podcast

2862
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
I'm terrible because I forgot the name

2863
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,000
And the gamer Edie's on, I like her

2864
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,000
She's a friend of the show

2865
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,000
GameHounds, that's what it's called

2866
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,000
I was listening to her show and she was interviewing the guys that made the Tron game

2867
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,000
At PAX because she was up at Penny Arcade Expo

2868
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
Where all the cool kids were except for us

2869
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,000
There is a Tron Playstation 3 controller coming out

2870
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,000
That glows blue

2871
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,000
And the minute I heard that I'm like, want

2872
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
Need, must have

2873
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,000
There's something other than that coming out

2874
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,000
Something I covered for Geek Life, plug plug plug

2875
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,000
Geek-Life.com

2876
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:25,000
The collector's edition with the bike?

2877
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,000
There's a keyboard and mouse coming out

2878
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,000
That has the blue lighting on it

2879
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,000
And the mouse is like one of those super nice

2880
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
Cushioned, ergonomic

2881
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,000
Really happy mice

2882
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,000
I am such a consumer whore because I want all of it

2883
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,000
I really do, I want the little PS3 controller

2884
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,000
I want the keyboard, I want the mouse

2885
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:43,000
I want the collector's edition of the game

2886
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,000
I'm sad

2887
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,000
If anyone wants to read about it you can go to

2888
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:49,000
Geek-Life.com and look up my Geek Cube article

2889
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,000
From a couple weeks ago

2890
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
The shameless plug alarm

2891
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,000
Is going off

2892
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,000
It's all good

2893
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
I will have to go read about that right now

2894
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,000
While Dark Soccer

2895
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,000
Does some other stories

2896
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,000
Ruining my fun, Rob

2897
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
Well

2898
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,000
And this is actually really cool

2899
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,000
We were talking about this not too long ago

2900
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
Borderlands

2901
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,000
Is getting a free update that will raise

2902
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,000
The level cap and rebalance the game

2903
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,000
Oooh

2904
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,000
And it's of course across all the platforms

2905
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000
Xbox 360, PS3, PC

2906
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,000
And this was announced

2907
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,000
At PAX by the way

2908
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
And the download content pack is called

2909
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,000
Claptrap's New Robot Revolution

2910
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,000
And

2911
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,000
It's

2912
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,000
It's going to be, I think, pretty good

2913
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,000
There were some issues

2914
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,000
With, you know, the way the game played

2915
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,000
I thought, I mean otherwise it was still really fun

2916
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,000
And also

2917
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,000
They just said it was

2918
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,000
Going to be the level cap at

2919
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,000
69

2920
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
That's funny

2921
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
It's going to be out

2922
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
It'll be released around October 12th

2923
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,000
When the Game of the Year edition comes out

2924
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
Kuma JP in chat just said the Xbox

2925
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,000
Is getting one of those Tron controllers too

2926
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
Damn it! That's another thing I'm going to have to buy now

2927
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,000
Shit

2928
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
And then

2929
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,000
For next week's Rock Band download content

2930
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,000
We've got some new stuff

2931
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,000
We have Holy Diver by Dio

2932
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
We have Stand Up and Shout by Dio

2933
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,000
We have Nirvana

2934
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
Juliana Hatfield

2935
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
I haven't heard any of her stuff in a long time

2936
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,000
Wow, she's still around making music?

2937
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,000
I haven't heard her since like college

2938
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
I think this is an older one

2939
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,000
Irish Blood English Heart by Morrissey

2940
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,000
I love Morrissey too

2941
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,000
This is totally like my

2942
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,000
College music

2943
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
This is music snob week, like it really is

2944
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
These are all the like, my music is better than yours

2945
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
Artists

2946
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
Straight Lines by Silverchair

2947
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
That's another group I listened to when I was like first going to college

2948
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,000
This Charming Man

2949
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,000
That was like the one male anorexic that we've ever heard of

2950
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,000
Was the guy in Silverchair

2951
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
This Charming Man by the Smiths

2952
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,000
It's also like Morrissey week

2953
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
And Writing on the Walls

2954
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,000
Under Oath

2955
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,000
Okay, I might have to get some points

2956
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
The list looks pretty awesome to me

2957
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
Which of course

2958
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
They're going to be

2959
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:15,000
Now, the dollar amount is really all the same for them

2960
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
But the Morrissey

2961
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,000
The one that's

2962
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
Irish Heart English Blood

2963
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000
This Charming Man and Writing on Walls are going to be

2964
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,000
160 Microsoft points each

2965
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000
While the others are 200

2966
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,000
Wii points

2967
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,000
They're all going to be on

2968
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,000
All the platforms, so

2969
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
And then, last but not least

2970
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,000
This is kind of funny, I think

2971
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000
Is that they're putting out

2972
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,000
A

2973
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,000
Wiimote

2974
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:45,000
That's going to be coinciding

2975
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,000
With the Wii title

2976
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,000
Doctor Who Return to Earth

2977
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,000
It's getting a Sonic Screwdriver

2978
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,000
Wii controller, and I think that's awesome

2979
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
It's of course based after

2980
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
The current 11th Doctor's

2981
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
Sonic Screwdriver

2982
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
Which, honestly, I still think

2983
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,000
That the best Sonic Screwdriver was

2984
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,000
10th, but that's me

2985
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,000
But it's also going to

2986
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,000
Have the voices of Matt Smith

2987
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,000
Who's currently playing the Doctor

2988
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
And his lovely Redhead companion

2989
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
It's going to be pretty cool

2990
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,000
I might have to

2991
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,000
To get that, I hope it comes out over here

2992
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
It better

2993
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
It very well might

2994
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
You never know

2995
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,000
By the way, just

2996
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
Completely random before we get into the Twitter topic

2997
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
Since DarkSakura brought up Rockband

2998
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,000
I know a friend of mine would be very upset

2999
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,000
If I did not mention UmLoud

3000
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
Is officially announced for this year

3001
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,000
This is the Rockband charity night

3002
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,000
You play Rockband on stage

3003
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,000
You pay money to do it, but it's this whole charity thing

3004
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,000
It's pretty awesome

3005
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,000
December 9th, the date has officially been announced this year

3006
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
They switched days, if I'm not mistaken

3007
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
It's not on the same night of the week

3008
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,000
I think last year it was on a Monday

3009
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,000
And this year it's going to be on a Thursday

3010
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,000
So it's moving up

3011
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
And apparently one of the big things they're doing this year

3012
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,000
There's going to be a headliner band

3013
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,000
That they're going to auction away

3014
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
That's pretty cool

3015
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
They're just going to sing Lady Gaga

3016
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
And we'll call ourselves Victoria and the Gays

3017
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,000
I'm really excited about that

3018
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
So you might have to come out and watch us rock it

3019
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,000
At UmLoud, but they do an internet stream too

3020
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,000
Which I want to say was very well trafficked last year

3021
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000
And you can donate to a good cause

3022
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,000
It's all for child's play, etc, etc

3023
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:23,000
I will make sure Se gets on the show to talk about this

3024
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,000
At some point

3025
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
If he doesn't come on I will be sad

3026
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,000
Moving on, let's get to some Twitter topics

3027
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,000
Some tweets

3028
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,000
The Twitters

3029
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:35,000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R

3030
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,000
If you want to send us some tweets

3031
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,000
Oops, I just closed them

3032
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,000
Because I'm a genius

3033
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,000
I was on the Twitter page

3034
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,000
And my fat finger clicked the button

3035
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,000
And I moved to a new page

3036
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
And now Twitter is giving me the fail whale

3037
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,000
That's great

3038
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,000
Oh, here we go

3039
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
Sbhail is asking

3040
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,000
Was going to ask what you guys thought about the Sony move

3041
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,000
But Rob's Twit pic already answered my question

3042
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,000
I didn't post a picture of me holding the

3043
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,000
Move controllers in a productive manner

3044
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,000
Or anything

3045
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,000
Well let me rephrase the question for Loki

3046
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,000
Because he already talked about the Sony move earlier in the show

3047
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,000
If you could sum up the Sony move in three words

3048
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,000
Loki, what would they be?

3049
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:15,000
Just like Nintendo

3050
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:17,000
Nice

3051
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,000
Let's see

3052
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,000
Tigerclaw is giving us some links tonight

3053
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,000
Steam is launching

3054
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,000
A beta for the Steam wallet

3055
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
Payment option

3056
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,000
Apparently this is something they're beta testing

3057
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,000
Instead of using a debit

3058
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
Or credit card

3059
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,000
You can actually use money out of your card

3060
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,000
And put it in a Steam wallet

3061
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
And then use the money to buy the game

3062
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000
Not sure how this works

3063
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
Or why this is practical

3064
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
I'm assuming it's some type of middle thing

3065
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
Where your parents, when you're good

3066
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,000
Will put $25 in your Steam wallet

3067
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,000
And then you as the child

3068
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,000
Can spend that on whatever

3069
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,000
I'm thinking that's what this is

3070
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,000
It's kind of like a fancy gift certificate

3071
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,000
I guess very soon

3072
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,000
It's being beta tested right now

3073
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,000
Also from Tigerclaw

3074
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,000
Because I'm nice and allowing two tweets tonight

3075
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,000
The Xbox Live murderer

3076
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,000
Was sentenced to two life sentences

3077
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,000
Oh the sad thing is

3078
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000
I look at this and I go

3079
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,000
Which Xbox Live murderer?

3080
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
Because unfortunately there's been a lot of them

3081
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,000
Well a jury convicted

3082
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
Let's see, what's the name of the asshole in this case?

3083
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,000
23 year old

3084
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,000
Derek Lee Hernandez

3085
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,000
Two mandatory life sentences

3086
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,000
Congratulations, no parole

3087
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,000
He killed 22 year old

3088
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
Jason Holly

3089
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
And it was a jury of six men and six women

3090
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
Who deliberated over two days

3091
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
Found him guilty

3092
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
Oh man

3093
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,000
I'm not even going to go into the gritty details

3094
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,000
About this

3095
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,000
Oh this was the guy, he was mentally challenged

3096
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,000
And the guy

3097
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
Kind of took advantage of him

3098
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
Remember this? This was the judge

3099
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
He wanted to be your friend Mr. Hernandez

3100
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
He would have done whatever you asked him

3101
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
And you took advantage of that

3102
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,000
You tricked him into coming up to the mountains

3103
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
And there was no other reason than to take his life

3104
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,000
And yeah it was all this whole like

3105
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,000
That he

3106
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,000
Took the 360

3107
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,000
From the poor guy

3108
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,000
It's messed up

3109
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000
But it really has nothing to do with games

3110
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,000
Again I hate these senseless murder things

3111
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,000
Alright

3112
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
Moving on, moving on, moving on

3113
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,000
Blue Swim

3114
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,000
Sending us a tweet

3115
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,000
What are your biggest gaming surprises

3116
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,000
And disappointments of the current console

3117
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:31,000
Generation? Great job on the marathon show

3118
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,000
Loved it

3119
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,000
Biggest gaming surprises and disappointments of the current console generation

3120
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,000
From Blue Swim

3121
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
Anyone?

3122
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,000
I would say biggest surprise would be

3123
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
LittleBigPlanet in a way

3124
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
I didn't think I'd like that as much as I did

3125
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,000
Biggest disappointment

3126
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:49,000
Is probably

3127
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,000
The Xbox Live game shows

3128
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
1 vs 100

3129
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,000
Going away so quickly

3130
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,000
And without replacement

3131
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
Anyone?

3132
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,000
Uh

3133
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:03,000
Hmm

3134
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
I don't really

3135
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
Have any major surprises

3136
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
Or anything I mean really I mean LittleBigPlanet

3137
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,000
I kind of expected it to do big

3138
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
Um

3139
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
I guess I'm kind of surprised about Final Fantasy 14

3140
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,000
Sucking so bad

3141
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,000
So I guess that's a disappointment

3142
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,000
Loki anything?

3143
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,000
Um

3144
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,000
Let's see I would say

3145
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,000
Disappointing would be

3146
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,000
Nintendo and them grasping

3147
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000
Online because

3148
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
They really haven't and I know that they have

3149
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,000
They have stuff in their store in fact

3150
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,000
I think the question is

3151
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:39,000
We should be posing is

3152
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
When's the last time that we've actually had a

3153
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
Virtual console release from them?

3154
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
Oh oh

3155
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,000
No disappointment I know the biggest disappointment

3156
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,000
PlayStation Home

3157
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
So much potential just down the toilet

3158
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,000
And to bounce off of that

3159
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
Um

3160
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
I would have to say probably

3161
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
Um

3162
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:01,000
Was it Microsoft's wonderful

3163
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,000
Arcade thing

3164
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,000
Game room Game room yeah

3165
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
Uh

3166
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,000
ActDeft in chat says

3167
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,000
The greatest surprise was Earth Defense

3168
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
Force

3169
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,000
Which funny enough leads into Blue Swim's

3170
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,000
Other tweets

3171
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
Loki might recognize where Blue Swim's from in a minute here

3172
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,000
And he says also

3173
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,000
If I got Loki or OLR in hot water with

3174
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:25,000
D3 publisher for the EDF story on CheapAssGamer

3175
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:27,000
I apologize

3176
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,000
Just wanted to share the EDF news and hopefully

3177
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,000
Send some new listeners OLR's way in the process

3178
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,000
Nah I know you didn't hear anything and you didn't

3179
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
Send any listeners our way because no one realized

3180
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
That you know it was from Orange Island

3181
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:39,000
But your blog got a lot of hits

3182
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,000
It was CheapAssGamer was the source of that story

3183
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,000
Yeah because clearly they talked about it

3184
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,000
On their show

3185
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:49,000
No we don't blame you Blue Swim

3186
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,000
Oh I know you're just excited

3187
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
Like Loki is about the game

3188
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,000
Remember I did add

3189
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,000
A little something though

3190
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,000
Remember it's not just 360

3191
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
This time

3192
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,000
Uh let's see

3193
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:07,000
DarkKisuke sends us a tweet saying

3194
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,000
You guys should play Dead Space for a show

3195
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
Maybe the next marathon show

3196
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,000
We don't usually play a lot of games on air while we're trying to do the show

3197
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,000
It's a little bit distracting

3198
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,000
For entertainment

3199
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:19,000
This question might be inappropriate

3200
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
So ready the inappropriate alarm

3201
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,000
DarkSakura could you ready the inappropriate alarm?

3202
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,000
Alright

3203
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:27,000
Cause this question's for you for entertainment

3204
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:29,000
Does DarkSakura have a vibrator

3205
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,000
To compare the PS3 dildo sticks to?

3206
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,000
Dildo sticks too

3207
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
No

3208
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,000
I had to think about it

3209
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,000
I had to think about it I don't think anything I have

3210
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,000
Her vibrators are uncomparable

3211
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:51,000
No mine aren't USB

3212
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:53,000
Spazinator PSN

3213
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
Oh this is a good question

3214
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,000
I totally forgot about this one

3215
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,000
Senses tweet feel like touching on the whole

3216
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,000
contemporary banning from Xbox Live

3217
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,000
Because some guy lived in Fort Gay

3218
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,000
West Virginia

3219
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:07,000
Please tell me you guys heard about this

3220
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,000
The guy put in his bio that he lived in Fort Gay

3221
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,000
West Virginia

3222
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:13,000
He got banned from Xbox Live

3223
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000
I thought though that they were stopping

3224
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,000
They weren't banning people from that stuff nowadays

3225
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,000
I think

3226
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,000
When it was looked at

3227
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,000
Some people thought

3228
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,000
That he was calling West Virginia

3229
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,000
Gay or something

3230
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:29,000
It's not gay it's Fort Gay

3231
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,000
There is

3232
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,000
It is a maximum security

3233
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:35,000
Gay facility

3234
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:37,000
Coincidentally is going to be the name of the OLR Fort

3235
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,000
That DarkSakura is going to take over someday

3236
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,000
Fort Gay

3237
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
Fort Gay?

3238
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,000
Because it means happy

3239
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,000
And we'll paint it rainbow

3240
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
Because everyone loves a rainbow

3241
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000
Especially a double rainbow

3242
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,000
What does it mean?

3243
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:55,000
I thought the fortress of sodomy

3244
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
That's next door

3245
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,000
Alright

3246
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:01,000
Obviously they're wearing egg

3247
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,000
On their face over the whole thing

3248
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,000
It's an excellent

3249
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:07,000
Case of the corporate

3250
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:09,000
Web and how the corporate

3251
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:11,000
Web allowed that thing to spiral

3252
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,000
Way out of control because you know

3253
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:15,000
There were rules that were set and this guy

3254
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:17,000
Is saying hey I

3255
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,000
Live there, google it

3256
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
It's a real place

3257
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,000
For you and me that's where it should have ended

3258
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,000
But unfortunately thanks to corporate

3259
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:27,000
Webs it didn't end there and caused

3260
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,000
A nightmare so now Microsoft

3261
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:31,000
Is going to have to look at their

3262
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:33,000
Corporate policy

3263
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000
To make sure this kind of dumb shit doesn't happen

3264
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:37,000
Again

3265
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:39,000
And Tigerclaw is saying

3266
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,000
That Microsoft better be careful because

3267
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:43,000
There is actually someone who lives in fucking

3268
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,000
Australia

3269
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,000
Isn't there a

3270
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,000
France or something

3271
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,000
I think there is another town called fucking

3272
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,000
Fucking Australia

3273
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,000
Oh no it's Austria not Australia

3274
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:57,000
That's what I get when I read too fast

3275
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,000
Fucking Austria

3276
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,000
Sorry Australia

3277
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,000
Readest town ever

3278
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,000
That's what I say when I realize

3279
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,000
Arnold Schwarzenegger really is the governor

3280
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,000
Fucking Austria, alright no just kidding

3281
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,000
I'm kidding, I'm kidding

3282
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:13,000
AlphaCananagram is sending us a tweet

3283
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:15,000
ChooChooRocket is coming back

3284
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:17,000
That's kind of cool

3285
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:19,000
ChooChooRocket is on its way out on the iPhone

3286
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,000
It's going to be out in October

3287
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:23,000
It might be coming to

3288
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,000
Xbox Live and Playstation Network

3289
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,000
We don't know but it might be

3290
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,000
Apparently it needs enough support on

3291
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,000
Facebook, it's a big Facebook

3292
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,000
Trend thing

3293
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,000
Let's see DJ Rama S appeals court

3294
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,000
Ruling threatens used

3295
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,000
Software sales, uh oh

3296
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,000
That can't be good

3297
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,000
He sends us a link here to this news

3298
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,000
Let's see

3299
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,000
A federal appeals court has sided with the computer software

3300
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,000
In its effort to squelch sales of second hand programs

3301
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
Covered by widely used licensing

3302
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,000
Agreements

3303
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
Let's see I'm looking here

3304
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,000
A doctrine refers to a 102 year old decision

3305
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,000
By the US Supreme Court that determined copyright holders

3306
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,000
Can't prevent a buyer from

3307
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,000
Reselling or renting a product after an initial

3308
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,000
Sale as long as additional copies

3309
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:07,000
Aren't made

3310
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:09,000
A three judge panel in the 9th district

3311
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,000
Concluded that first

3312
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,000
Sale doctrine didn't apply to used

3313
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,000
Software programs that online merchant

3314
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:17,000
Timothy Verner peddled in his

3315
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
Store on Ebay

3316
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:21,000
Oh this might not be good

3317
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,000
I have to read up more on this later

3318
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:25,000
I haven't seen this covered on a lot of sites

3319
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:27,000
Well

3320
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:29,000
We'll see what the legal mumbo jumbo

3321
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
Is as it comes to this

3322
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,000
This is just like the first of many

3323
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,000
Things

3324
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,000
Alright

3325
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:39,000
And SSJ100Matt on twitter is saying

3326
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,000
Comedy site zug.com pulled a real life

3327
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:43,000
Lemmings prank in downtown

3328
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,000
Boston oh this has got to be interesting

3329
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,000
Is this like a little video or something

3330
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
Wow they actually dressed up in what looks

3331
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,000
Like blue snuggies and green wigs

3332
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:55,000
This is like one of those like stupid flash mob

3333
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:57,000
Things I'm looking at the thing on youtube

3334
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:59,000
Yep so there they go

3335
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:01,000
They're walking into the water and falling in

3336
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:05,000
This is the dumbest thing I've ever

3337
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,000
Seen in my life

3338
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,000
I love how there's all these college kids in the back

3339
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,000
That like don't even care

3340
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
Some people have too much time on their hands

3341
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
But I love the look I love the snuggies as outfits

3342
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
And lastly

3343
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
Marin Marvel on twitter is saying

3344
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
I'm totally guest hosting on OLR on October 1st

3345
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
When Sky is out of town

3346
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
You should it'll be fun

3347
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,000
Actually you shouldn't you should come to Disneyland

3348
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,000
With me you know Disneyland is better than this show

3349
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
Sorry just saying

3350
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
Just saying

3351
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
That's it for the tweeters tonight

3352
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
OLR

3353
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
Back to gaming news Loki

3354
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
Ah yes so speaking

3355
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
Of tweets

3356
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,000
This is retarded but

3357
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,000
I guess the natural progression of

3358
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,000
Stuff

3359
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
Guitar Hero Warriors

3360
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,000
Rock will be the first

3361
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
Guitar Hero game

3362
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
I can't see this with any less

3363
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000
Enthusiasm to integrate

3364
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
Twitter and Facebook

3365
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,000
Hurrah

3366
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,000
Everybody can know when you do

3367
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,000
Stuff in this game

3368
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
Like I give a shit

3369
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,000
But yes

3370
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,000
It will be coming is confirmed on the Wii

3371
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,000
I can tell you right now

3372
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,000
Based off the presentation that was given to me

3373
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
By the Activision reps

3374
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,000
It is also coming to the Playstation 3 and the Xbox 360

3375
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
Which is not a big surprise

3376
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
Um

3377
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
Yes and apparently they've also

3378
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,000
Incorporated a Wii award system

3379
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
So when you do specific challenges in the game

3380
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,000
You get credited for an award

3381
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
And then you can share those online

3382
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
With your friends

3383
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
And if you share those online with your friends

3384
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
They're gonna block you

3385
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
That's right

3386
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
Now my steam is working

3387
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
So

3388
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
Hurrah

3389
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
And guess what though at least you know

3390
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,000
Well you already know this but I mean if you

3391
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
Buy guitar hero early you get a CD

3392
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
Of like

3393
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,000
Actual songs that are included in the game

3394
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
Soundgarden's new album

3395
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,000
Interesting tactic

3396
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,000
If you like Soundgarden I guess

3397
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
Yeah I'll be blocking that on Facebook

3398
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
Pretty quickly no offense

3399
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,000
Not really my thing

3400
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
Hey but there's more details on Rock Band 3

3401
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
I'm excited about this

3402
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
No Twitter or Facebook integration here

3403
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
Actually they are confirming that you will be

3404
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,000
Able to export Rock Band 2 tracks

3405
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,000
For a fee

3406
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
The export feature will work on all three

3407
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
Consoles of course there's always a couple

3408
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
Of songs that get a little weird

3409
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
So you can imagine that a couple songs

3410
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
Are gonna fall off the list unfortunately

3411
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
But most of them should come over for a small fee

3412
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
That's really cool

3413
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,000
Regular download content will remain the regular

3414
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,000
Price that's $2 per song but

3415
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
They are saying that for Rock Band 3's

3416
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
Pro mode

3417
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,000
The songs will probably be more expensive

3418
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,000
Because there's more work that has to be done on

3419
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
These tracks and they don't want to increase

3420
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,000
The cost of regular download content

3421
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
To subsidize the pro download content

3422
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
That's aimed at a smaller group of players

3423
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,000
Usually I'd be a little worried about this

3424
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
But I go you know what I feel like

3425
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
Harmonix kind of does the download content

3426
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
Better than almost anyone right now so I'm like

3427
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,000
Okay I trust them

3428
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
Like I don't know how you guys feel but I'm just kind of like okay

3429
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,000
If that's what they say I trust them

3430
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,000
They get it

3431
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
They've proved that they understand download content for a very long time

3432
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
This export feature is great

3433
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
You know yeah it's a fee but

3434
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,000
I understand it's out of their hands and it's licensing

3435
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,000
At least they bother to do it at all

3436
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,000
I kind of go okay they know what they're doing

3437
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
If that's what they say then I agree

3438
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,000
Plus it also makes sense that the Rock Band

3439
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,000
Stuff would cost a little more

3440
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,000
In the pro mode because there's probably less people

3441
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,000
Buying them too you know

3442
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,000
Yeah I mean you have to have the pro mode instruments

3443
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,000
And stuff like that which are really expensive

3444
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
Well at least on the guitar

3445
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,000
It's really expensive but

3446
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
You know the keyboard's not so much

3447
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,000
I don't know

3448
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,000
I wouldn't want to pay extra for that stuff

3449
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
But if you really want to

3450
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,000
There's a market for it

3451
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
I'm interested in the pro mode stuff

3452
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,000
Especially for keyboards

3453
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
Because once you learn how to like play the song

3454
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
On a keyboard you could actually go to like a piano

3455
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
Or whatever and play it I think that's awesome

3456
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
If you can memorize it so

3457
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
I'm looking forward to trying that out

3458
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
That's going to be very cool

3459
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
So we're going to go over to Dark Sakura

3460
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
Who's got another story for us here

3461
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
I sure do

3462
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,000
Coming up very soon the mailbag

3463
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
From Marvel versus Capcom the FUs of the week

3464
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
And your calls

3465
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
Well we've got a new challenger in

3466
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
For Marvel versus Capcom 3

3467
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
And this is

3468
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
Pretty pretty sweet

3469
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,000
But we're getting Tron Bonn

3470
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
That's so cool

3471
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
She's kind of on crack

3472
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
She's kind of been in like

3473
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,000
A lot of the fighting games right

3474
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
Give us the new Mega Man Legends already

3475
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,000
I hate you

3476
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
Servbots have been in the background

3477
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
In Capcom, they're so cute

3478
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
They look like Lego Men

3479
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,000
Yeah I agree though, where's Mega Man Legends

3480
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,000
There is coming but it's

3481
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
It's just going to take forever

3482
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000
I would buy that on PS1 Classics if I could

3483
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,000
Is that available? I don't think it is

3484
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:08,000
For PS1 Classics

3485
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,000
Damn you Capcom

3486
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,000
Just when you're doing so many things right

3487
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
There's that one thing

3488
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,000
One thing

3489
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,000
You know with

3490
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,000
Let's say that the

3491
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,000
Homebrew scene or pirating scene

3492
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
However you want to call it

3493
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,000
Gets to where it is on the PSP

3494
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,000
They have ways to convert

3495
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,000
PS1 ISO files into

3496
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,000
A playable format on the

3497
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:34,000
PlayStation emulator that's on the

3498
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,000
PSP so you can port

3499
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,000
Mega Man Legends or something like that

3500
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,000
If they can do it for the PSP

3501
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
They may be able to do it for the PS3

3502
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
Very nice

3503
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,000
Or I could just find the PS1 disc somewhere and play it

3504
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
My PS3

3505
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,000
Is that hard to find?

3506
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,000
No they're not

3507
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,000
I don't remember the game being particularly rare

3508
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
I could be wrong but

3509
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
Yeah

3510
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,000
Anyhow speaking of Mega Man Loki right?

3511
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
Yes speaking of Mega Man

3512
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
There's some new details coming out

3513
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,000
About Mega Man Universe

3514
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,000
And it's kind of cool

3515
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,000
The game itself looks a little bit like

3516
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,000
It could be similar to the Mega Man

3517
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
Powered up Mega Man

3518
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
Which was on the PSP

3519
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
It showed a level editor

3520
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
That's awesome

3521
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
That you'll be able to share of course

3522
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
With your friends

3523
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
Different levels that you've made

3524
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
It's Little Big Mega Man

3525
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
Isn't that what this game is turning into?

3526
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,000
It seriously is getting pretty awesome

3527
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
And they had some other screenshots

3528
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
That showed

3529
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
Different playable characters

3530
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
They had a screenshot that actually showed

3531
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
The box art Mega Man plane

3532
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000
Also you can create

3533
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,000
New Mega Man characters by

3534
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,000
Mixing and matching different parts

3535
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000
Like different heads and what not

3536
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,000
Really cool stuff and also I guess

3537
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:56,000
They're saying that

3538
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,000
Of course there's going to be the

3539
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,000
Ryu Mega Man that's in there

3540
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
Probably the ghosts and goblins Mega Man

3541
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,000
Mega Men

3542
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,000
Mega Men yes

3543
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,000
In fact here's the screenshot there of

3544
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,000
The box art one which

3545
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,000
Is so ugly

3546
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
Well you know this isn't the first time that Mega Man's had

3547
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,000
Street Fighter moves

3548
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,000
Because remember in X2

3549
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
He could get the Hadoken and Shoryuken

3550
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,000
If you did the special

3551
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:26,000
Level thing

3552
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,000
Which I could do

3553
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,000
But the game itself though

3554
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,000
I'm kind of rusty when it comes to

3555
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,000
Identifying my Mega Man stages

3556
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,000
But I'm wondering if it's going to have

3557
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
More than just

3558
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,000
It looks like Mega Man

3559
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,000
2 characters

3560
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,000
It looks very Mega Man 2 inspired

3561
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,000
Doesn't it? I'm wondering if it's going to have more than that

3562
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,000
That might be cool. Alpha Cananagram

3563
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,000
In the chat is quick to correct me on things

3564
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,000
He says Mega Man powered up with

3565
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,000
The level editor came out 2 years before

3566
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,000
Little Big Planet

3567
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,000
True enough I suppose but I don't know

3568
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,000
I kind of feel like Little Big Planet's

3569
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
Really made the splash you know what I mean I don't know

3570
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,000
Yeah

3571
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
But ok sure so this idea is

3572
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
Not entirely new for the Mega Man series

3573
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:12,000
Well I know I'm interested in the game

3574
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,000
I'm going to buy it. Is it arcade or is it retail?

3575
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,000
Have they said? Arcade

3576
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,000
Oh man that's going to be a heck of an arcade game

3577
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,000
Hopefully it's not more than

3578
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:22,000
20 bucks but watch them be charging like 30

3579
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:26,000
If there's going to be a game that's going to break the price barrier

3580
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
Yet again it'll be this. Watch

3581
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
We'll see though

3582
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
Hopefully not

3583
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,000
If they do try to break the barrier

3584
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,000
It might leave Valve to talk even more smack

3585
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,000
About Xbox Live. Oh you haven't heard

3586
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,000
Valve has apparently talked some smack

3587
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
About Xbox Live

3588
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
This is kind of interesting because I seem to recall

3589
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
Some time ago it was just the reverse

3590
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
They used to dog on Playstation 3

3591
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,000
And they were supporting Xbox Live

3592
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,000
With exclusives such as Portal still alive

3593
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,000
Well times have changed a little bit

3594
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
Haven't they?

3595
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,000
Gabe Newell has referred to Xbox Live as a

3596
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
Train Wreck

3597
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,000
Quote, we thought that there would be something that would emerge

3598
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,000
Because we figured it was sort of untenable

3599
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:06,000
Oh yeah we understand that these are the rules now

3600
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,000
But it's such a train wreck that something

3601
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,000
Will have to change

3602
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,000
That's why we're really happy with the current situation with the Playstation 3

3603
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,000
We're solving it now in a way that is going to work

3604
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
For our customers rather than assuming

3605
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,000
Something is going to emerge later

3606
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
That will allow us to fix this

3607
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,000
Yikes

3608
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
They're saying that Microsoft has got to change the

3609
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
Online policies if they want to compete

3610
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,000
You know I want to say though not the first person

3611
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,000
To dog a little bit on Xbox Live

3612
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,000
This kind of reminds me of Square Enix

3613
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,000
Coming out a little bit ago saying that

3614
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,000
Final Fantasy 14 is not coming out on the

3615
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,000
Xbox 360 because Xbox Live

3616
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,000
Just ain't going to work

3617
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,000
That's what they're saying

3618
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
Very interesting

3619
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000
Yeah

3620
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
It's interesting to me

3621
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,000
Kind of how Valve has come full circle

3622
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,000
I mean and I can see the reasons

3623
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,000
Why to an extent

3624
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,000
And certainly again not the first developer

3625
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
To say bad things about

3626
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
Xbox Live but it's just very interesting

3627
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
How much things have changed in a few years

3628
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,000
There you go

3629
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,000
Let's get to the mail bag

3630
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,000
Shall we? Dark Soccer you ready to rip open the email

3631
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,000
Bag and read some emails for us here?

3632
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,000
I'm ready to rip something

3633
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,000
Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com

3634
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
If you want to send us any emails to be read on the

3635
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,000
Air. Did we get some emails? The mailbag was pretty

3636
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:28,000
Thin going into tonight's show. Did we get some?

3637
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
We got a few

3638
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
The first one's from awesomedude slash troy

3639
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,000
Now this is the philosophical question I gave us some

3640
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
Warning

3641
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,000
Even though my emails might be getting monotonous

3642
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
From the consistency of pointless ones

3643
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
This question actually has meaning

3644
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,000
Now I have had this brewing

3645
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
In my head for a couple of days

3646
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
And I'm afraid I might not be able to do it

3647
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
Either before well I leave this

3648
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
Dying ball of life we call Earth

3649
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
Yeah I just tried to make that sound cool

3650
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
If you had to choose changing

3651
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
The world and leaving your mark on it or

3652
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,000
Living your life with a loved one which one would you choose?

3653
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,000
You know what I would choose?

3654
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
I don't see why you can't do both

3655
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,000
Jeez

3656
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,000
I know it's tricky because what's going to

3657
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,000
Prevent me from doing one over the other it's

3658
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
Strange um

3659
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
What if by being with somebody you leave your mark

3660
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,000
On the world? I kind of feel like

3661
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
Okay this is going to sound really cheesy but I feel

3662
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
Like in a way this show has left the mark

3663
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
On the world a little bit

3664
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:28,000
Like maybe not in a totally like

3665
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
Amazing humanitarian

3666
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,000
Mother Teresa kind of way

3667
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,000
But just some of the really nice

3668
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,000
Emails that I've got over the years

3669
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,000
Especially from like you know other

3670
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,000
Guys who sometimes struggle

3671
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:42,000
With oops not the FU music yet

3672
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,000
Um sometimes other guys who've like struggled

3673
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,000
With coming out and stuff and saying that like

3674
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:48,000
Hearing me on the show has helped with that like the power

3675
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,000
Of an email like that is like

3676
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,000
Really hard to put into words

3677
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:54,000
And just like in how that makes you feel

3678
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:56,000
Like you've really had an impact and I know

3679
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,000
You know there's there's quote unquote fans

3680
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,000
Of all of us out there which is such a strange

3681
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
Feeling because we're pretty normal

3682
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
People we just like video games and

3683
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,000
Figured out how to do this radio thing pretty

3684
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,000
Quickly and have stayed pretty dedicated to it

3685
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,000
Um that those kind of words have been amazing

3686
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,000
So I kind of feel like in some ways

3687
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,000
I've already picked the first option

3688
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:16,000
Because I'm not living with a loved

3689
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,000
One right now the dark soccer is

3690
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
Doing both yeah so

3691
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,000
It's tough because you're asking me to backtrack

3692
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,000
I don't know I don't see

3693
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
Why you can't do both I mean what's the

3694
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,000
They're not mutually exclusive

3695
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,000
Plus if you live with a loved

3696
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,000
One aren't you leaving your mark

3697
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,000
On the world

3698
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,000
With that relationship I know that sounds

3699
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,000
So weird but a little bit my philosophy

3700
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,000
Is that the best way to change the world

3701
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:42,000
And leave your mark is to be an active

3702
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:44,000
Part of making it better

3703
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,000
To

3704
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:48,000
Not be a dick to people

3705
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:50,000
You know

3706
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,000
To

3707
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,000
You know if you've got the extra time

3708
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,000
And you're just sitting on your butt

3709
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,000
You know go volunteer or something

3710
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:00,000
There's nothing to say that you can't do

3711
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,000
Both just love people

3712
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,000
And it doesn't mean I don't mean like sex

3713
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,000
I don't mean like love like kissy

3714
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:08,000
Kissy I just mean like there's all different types

3715
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,000
Of love there's platonic love there's

3716
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,000
Family love brotherly love

3717
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,000
You know there is romantic love there's

3718
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,000
Love for earth I don't mean

3719
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,000
To sound like a hippie or whatever but

3720
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,000
I think that's kind of what a lot of it's about

3721
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:22,000
Isn't it? You've nailed it on the head

3722
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:24,000
Just

3723
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,000
Don't love people

3724
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,000
People get all butt hurt over their own political

3725
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,000
You know points of view being

3726
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,000
Hey everyone's gotta believe what I do

3727
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,000
Man

3728
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,000
But you know if everyone was exactly the same

3729
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,000
It would be boring

3730
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:40,000
And we would stagnate

3731
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,000
It's those differences that put a challenge

3732
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,000
We would be the Borg

3733
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,000
I am a firm believer that people don't

3734
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:48,000
Grow without a challenge

3735
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:50,000
That you have to have that challenge for people to overcome

3736
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:52,000
And if they don't overcome those are the people who don't

3737
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,000
Get to do anything in the world

3738
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
You know they're just gonna

3739
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:00,000
I have a hard time putting this

3740
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,000
Because some people are content to live their life

3741
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:04,000
Just being themselves

3742
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,000
You know not doing anything

3743
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:08,000
But I think that the best

3744
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:10,000
Way to grow and challenge

3745
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:12,000
Yourself is to

3746
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:14,000
Move outside your comfort zone

3747
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:16,000
To do something that's gonna make it better

3748
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:18,000
Because nothing changes until you make a change

3749
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,000
Well

3750
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,000
That has nothing to do with games

3751
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:24,000
That was a very deep email for this program

3752
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:26,000
But hey sorry to dodge your question

3753
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:28,000
But hope you got out of it

3754
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:30,000
Loki didn't say anything

3755
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,000
Eh

3756
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,000
There I said something

3757
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:36,000
Oh Loki

3758
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,000
Next email

3759
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:40,000
Hi OLR crew this is your friendly neighborhood Mexican act

3760
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:42,000
I wanted to tell you that you did a pretty damn

3761
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,000
Good job with the marathon on Sunday

3762
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,000
Slash Monday I wish I could have been

3763
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:48,000
There while this was live but I

3764
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,000
Did catch the podcast

3765
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:52,000
Is this

3766
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,000
You about many interesting topics

3767
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:56,000
Like favorite game and soundtracks

3768
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:58,000
I guess it's you spoke about many interesting

3769
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,000
Topics like favorite game and soundtracks

3770
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,000
And other stuff since I wasn't there to participate in

3771
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:04,000
The chat room I would like to participate to

3772
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:06,000
That with this email

3773
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
My favorite game and probably my favorite

3774
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,000
Soundtrack of all time is Kirby Superstar

3775
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,000
So many different games to choose

3776
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:14,000
From and they're pretty detailed with puzzles

3777
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,000
And pretty good platforming

3778
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:18,000
Actdeft likes Kirby you don't say

3779
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:20,000
I didn't know I hadn't heard

3780
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:22,000
Hey No it's funny that's cool

3781
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:24,000
And the soundtrack to it is pretty amazing

3782
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:26,000
And probably since then

3783
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:28,000
It has made me so interested in video music

3784
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,000
Like I am now

3785
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,000
Video game music sorry

3786
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,000
I would really recommend people getting

3787
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:36,000
Kirby Superstar Ultra on the DS

3788
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,000
Make it worthy

3789
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:40,000
Make it worthy of any DS game library

3790
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,000
But not as all

3791
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:44,000
Happy game wise

3792
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,000
Excuse me

3793
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,000
You also talked about disappointment

3794
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:50,000
Mine was Final Fantasy 8

3795
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:52,000
Got it for cheap but I still think I got robbed

3796
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:54,000
Hey let me finish

3797
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:56,000
Well I don't like Final Fantasy 7 either

3798
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,000
At least in

3799
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,000
At least decent in lots of things

3800
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,000
Final Fantasy 8 really takes all the good things

3801
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,000
Of the series and burns them to the ground

3802
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,000
The card game is damn awful

3803
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:08,000
I never played the card game for the record

3804
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,000
And it doesn't give you a real good incentive

3805
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:12,000
To play it kind of like Blitzball and Final Fantasy 10

3806
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:14,000
Which I didn't really do either

3807
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:16,000
But the thing I hate the most

3808
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,000
About the whole damn game is the story

3809
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:20,000
It sucks bad it's terra bad

3810
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,000
I don't even like Final Fantasy 10

3811
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:24,000
Pretty much for the same things

3812
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:26,000
But I didn't buy it and even though the battle system

3813
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:28,000
And grid system is kind of cool

3814
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:30,000
Final Fantasy 8 really I don't give a crap about that game

3815
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,000
See he doesn't like it for the wrong reasons

3816
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:34,000
Cause I think the story was actually

3817
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:36,000
It's strongest part it's the battles

3818
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,000
That really did it in for me

3819
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,000
But from what I play to the beta

3820
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:42,000
14 very well might be worse than 8

3821
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:44,000
Like I don't know yet

3822
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:46,000
I guess I will have to play the retail version

3823
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:48,000
At some point to give you my final thoughts

3824
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:50,000
But there may be a new challenger

3825
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:52,000
For the worst Final Fantasy game ever

3826
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:54,000
Oh no the new challenger has appeared

3827
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:56,000
I'll let you know

3828
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:58,000
Oh well that's all for now I will talk about other stuff

3829
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:00,000
You talked about next week

3830
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
I don't want to send a big ass email

3831
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:04,000
Too late no I'm kidding

3832
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,000
Until next time

3833
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,000
P.S. I still don't believe that Duke Nukem Forever will get released

3834
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,000
We'll see

3835
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,000
And I wonder if this one

3836
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:16,000
I think it will now that it's with the new developer

3837
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:18,000
I think that's what had to happen

3838
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,000
It just needed to be taken by somebody else

3839
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,000
It'll come out now

3840
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:24,000
Next email

3841
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,000
When you guys were young did you ever play a game

3842
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:28,000
That was so horrible but there was something about it

3843
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:30,000
That always kept you playing

3844
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,000
One bad game that comes to mind is Banjo-Kazooie

3845
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:34,000
I spent countless hours sitting in front of my parents TV screen

3846
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:36,000
Trying to collect all those little

3847
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:38,000
Glowing puzzle pieces

3848
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:40,000
I wanted to punch the TV screen every time the crazy

3849
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,000
Bear and bird spoke

3850
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,000
However for some unknown reason I kept playing till I beat it

3851
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:46,000
Today I cringe when I hear any song from that game

3852
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:48,000
What about you guys?

3853
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,000
Your fellow girl gamer Ziba

3854
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:52,000
Clash at Demonhead

3855
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:54,000
Totally

3856
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:56,000
It's not that great a game really

3857
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,000
It's definitely a guilty pleasure game

3858
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:00,000
I used to love that game and I don't know why

3859
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,000
As far as old school 8-bit NES games go

3860
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,000
I really can't remember any

3861
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,000
There's games that pissed me off that I'd keep playing

3862
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,000
Like Puzzle and Desu

3863
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,000
I'm sorry, you remember I covered that on Classic Game?

3864
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:14,000
That game pisses me off so much

3865
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:18,000
And it's really not even the best game ever

3866
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:20,000
But the challenge is so hard to it

3867
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,000
Ugh, that game pisses me off

3868
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,000
What about you, Loki?

3869
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:30,000
Earth Defense Force

3870
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:32,000
It gets really challenging

3871
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:34,000
Especially when you get on those inferno levels

3872
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:36,000
Sometimes it makes me want to hurt somebody

3873
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:38,000
And I just play more of it

3874
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:40,000
Good call

3875
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:42,000
Last email

3876
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:44,000
No!

3877
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:46,000
Hey, OLR, emailing in on a few things

3878
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:48,000
That I wouldn't recommend

3879
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:52,000
But I know I would forget, so here it goes

3880
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,000
I know this news is two weeks late

3881
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,000
But Sony not only has their dreaded online pass

3882
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:58,000
On some sports games

3883
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:00,000
But it's on an awesome PSP FPS

3884
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:02,000
Called SOCOM Fireteam Bravo 3

3885
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,000
Also, this may be old news

3886
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:06,000
But I've never heard this on the radio

3887
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:08,000
Any radio which makes me laugh

3888
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:10,000
Any of you heard of a game

3889
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:12,000
Called Minecraft?

3890
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,000
I've never heard of it

3891
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:16,000
I've never heard of it

3892
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,000
Any of you heard of a game called Minecraft?

3893
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,000
Don't judge on graphics

3894
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,000
Although you guys probably wouldn't

3895
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,000
My way of describing it would be

3896
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
Awesomesauce imagination orgasm

3897
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,000
Okay

3898
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,000
You have unlimited boundaries

3899
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,000
North, south, east, and west

3900
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,000
And you can go really far up and down

3901
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:36,000
And it's only in alpha

3902
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:38,000
Give it a try and decide whether or not to buy it

3903
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:40,000
It's only 10 euros or about 13 bucks

3904
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:42,000
And it entitles you to play future releases of the game

3905
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,000
And he put the address

3906
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:46,000
C-R-A-F-T dot net

3907
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,000
Is he a co-producer or writer?

3908
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,000
I don't know. I don't think so

3909
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:52,000
Currently it has only one developer

3910
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,000
But he's awesome

3911
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,000
Here's the bullshit part

3912
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:58,000
He's been making so much money from people paying for it

3913
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:00,000
PayPal fucking froze his account

3914
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,000
Due to a suspicious withdrawal or deposit

3915
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,000
That's pretty funny

3916
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:06,000
Um

3917
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,000
I'm actually gonna look at this real quick

3918
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,000
Cause I wouldn't

3919
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:12,000
Hitstun in our chatroom says there's a lot of Minecraft

3920
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,000
On Justin TV

3921
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,000
It doesn't look that bad

3922
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:18,000
It looks really, um

3923
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,000
Super Nintendo-ish 3D

3924
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:22,000
But yeah

3925
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,000
Apparently he

3926
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000
It was over 600,000 euros

3927
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,000
And then

3928
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,000
PayPal is like trying to keep the money or something

3929
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,000
That's weird

3930
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,000
That's kinda screwed up

3931
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
Anyway, gonna continue

3932
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,000
Minecraft may seem odd

3933
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:42,000
But it's great and freaking addictive

3934
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000
When you realize all the possible things you can do

3935
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,000
Slash make

3936
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:48,000
Um, well, I think that's enough for one email

3937
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:50,000
But I'll chat slash call in if I have anything else of interest

3938
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:52,000
That comes up

3939
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:54,000
May the Flying Spaghetti Monster bless your souls

3940
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:56,000
DarkCuseK AKA Butcher

3941
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,000
Raw man

3942
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:00,000
P.S. Gonna be super sad to not hear your voices next week

3943
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:02,000
I guess he's not gonna be listening next week

3944
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:04,000
Oh, oh

3945
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:06,000
I forgot

3946
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:08,000
He sent us a tweet that said disregard is P.S.

3947
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:10,000
Oopsie

3948
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:12,000
Whoops

3949
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:14,000
Screwed up on that one

3950
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:16,000
I think he might have us mixed up with Bobby Black Wolf

3951
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:18,000
Cause Bobby's not live next week

3952
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:20,000
Oh, YouTube

3953
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:22,000
Alan sent me this YouTube

3954
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:24,000
And if Alan sent it to me I have to look at it

3955
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:26,000
He told me a little bit about what it is

3956
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:28,000
And I'd heard of this

3957
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:30,000
And it sounds kinda cool

3958
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,000
Oh, it's like, uh, stop motion

3959
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,000
All these people in colored shirts

3960
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:36,000
Sitting in chairs

3961
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,000
Doing Pac-Man

3962
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:40,000
They do these in a movie theater

3963
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:42,000
That's kind of rad

3964
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:46,000
Can Alan link that in chat?

3965
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,000
Please? Thank you

3966
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,000
I like the little noise in the background

3967
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:52,000
Let me turn that up a little bit

3968
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,000
Doo doo doo doo doo

3969
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:06,000
I love the noises more than anything

3970
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:08,000
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo

3971
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:10,000
Okay, anyway, this makes for terrible radio

3972
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,000
People did a Space Invaders one

3973
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,000
That takes a lot of work

3974
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:16,000
Like, that took all day

3975
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:20,000
God

3976
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,000
College kids

3977
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:24,000
Y'all had too much free time

3978
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:26,000
It's a lot of its editing though

3979
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:28,000
Because all they had to do was get one scene

3980
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:30,000
Where everybody was sitting in the grid

3981
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:32,000
In the beginning

3982
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,000
And then just take one shot of that and keep superimposing

3983
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,000
Where he's at

3984
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:38,000
It does take a lot of effort

3985
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,000
But it's not as much as

3986
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:42,000
They used magic and witchcraft

3987
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,000
Or they took one shot

3988
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:46,000
Where he wasn't in each spot and just kept playing

3989
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:48,000
Stop motion

3990
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:50,000
They had to hold that camera

3991
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,000
Real steady

3992
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:54,000
Real steady

3993
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:56,000
Hey, it's that time of the show where we get mad

3994
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:58,000
The FUs of the Week

3995
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:16,000
Um

3996
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:18,000
My FU of the Week goes to, uh, Dan not being here

3997
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,000
Well, I mean

3998
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:22,000
And I understand it was important to go to see his family

3999
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,000
But still

4000
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:26,000
It doesn't really stop me from being very lonely

4001
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:28,000
Because he's been

4002
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:30,000
You know, while he's not working and I wasn't working

4003
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:32,000
I was used to having him here all day

4004
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:34,000
And it was really nice

4005
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,000
And now he's not there

4006
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:38,000
And also I have to go back into the office tomorrow

4007
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:40,000
Because bitches didn't send me my, um

4008
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,000
My letter about getting laid off

4009
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:44,000
And I haven't been paid in two weeks

4010
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:46,000
So you know what this means

4011
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:48,000
If they don't fix it

4012
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:50,000
I can collect interest

4013
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:52,000
On my pay

4014
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:54,000
And if they don't get anything to me

4015
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:56,000
I'm going to the labor board

4016
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,000
Alert the media

4017
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,000
Well, I could talk to the media too

4018
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:02,000
I don't know how far I want to get into this

4019
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:04,000
But I was looking at work at the news

4020
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:06,000
And the latest things

4021
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:08,000
I saw your work on the

4022
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:10,000
Local news media site

4023
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:12,000
About the closure

4024
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,000
And see, I never got any memo that says

4025
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:16,000
Don't talk about it

4026
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:18,000
I'm not under NDA

4027
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:20,000
Oh

4028
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:22,000
Uh, Loki

4029
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:24,000
I had some that I was

4030
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:26,000
Really pissed off about earlier

4031
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:28,000
And I don't remember what it was

4032
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:30,000
I'm going to go with my second

4033
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:32,000
Thing that I'm pissed off at

4034
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:34,000
And that would be Apple

4035
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:36,000
And I'm pissed off at their customer service

4036
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:38,000
It's good and terrible at the same time

4037
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:40,000
The reps are nice

4038
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:42,000
The just simple

4039
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:44,000
Logic stuff just doesn't seem to

4040
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:46,000
Apply to them. For example

4041
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:48,000
I purchased two iPod Touches

4042
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:50,000
From them using an Apple gift card

4043
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:52,000
That I got from Sony

4044
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:54,000
From my work for some sort of sales

4045
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:56,000
Incentive thing

4046
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:58,000
I purchased it on the third

4047
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:00,000
And they

4048
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:02,000
According to the site

4049
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:04,000
When I ordered it, it said it was going to be shipped

4050
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:06,000
This week

4051
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:08,000
Instead this week, they changed it

4052
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:10,000
And it's shipping next week

4053
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:12,000
And you know

4054
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:14,000
Meanwhile, the Apple store has tons of these

4055
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:16,000
They have just a pile of them

4056
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:18,000
Just sitting there

4057
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:20,000
So I called them up multiple times going

4058
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:22,000
I need to cancel my order

4059
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:24,000
So that I can go purchase

4060
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:26,000
Oh I'm sorry, even though we took off

4061
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:28,000
The funds immediately out of your card

4062
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:30,000
It's going to take us five to seven business days

4063
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:32,000
To put it back on the card

4064
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:34,000
Even though it's their own Apple card

4065
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,000
I'm like, well okay fine, I don't really want to cancel

4066
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:38,000
I just want to pick it up at the local store

4067
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:40,000
Because they have them in stock

4068
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:42,000
Oh no, I'm sorry you can't do that

4069
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:44,000
Because our systems are separate

4070
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:46,000
So that's retarded

4071
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:48,000
It finally shipped though on Friday

4072
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:50,000
FROM CANADA

4073
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:52,000
Why the fuck are you shipping something

4074
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:54,000
From Canada to the United States

4075
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:56,000
I'm sure you have a fucking plant

4076
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:58,000
In the US that you can ship these from

4077
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:00,000
But no, let's pick a really far away

4078
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:02,000
Place to ship it from

4079
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:04,000
Just to piss me off even more

4080
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:06,000
I wouldn't have these, that fucking gift card

4081
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:08,000
I wouldn't be buying your stupid iPods

4082
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:10,000
But I am

4083
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:12,000
Like I'm fucking going to buy an ITV

4084
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:14,000
Or an iMac, no way

4085
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:16,000
We're part of Canada

4086
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:18,000
I don't know

4087
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:20,000
I'm not familiar with Canada

4088
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:22,000
I can look that up real quick while you do your FUs

4089
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:24,000
I will, my FU

4090
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:26,000
Goes to myself

4091
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:28,000
Because I've managed to put a scratch on my brand new car

4092
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:30,000
After having it for only about

4093
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:32,000
Two and a half months

4094
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,000
I'm going to park

4095
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:36,000
Don't worry, I didn't hit another car

4096
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:38,000
Refrain from making fun of me

4097
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:40,000
Because I will destroy you

4098
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:42,000
I scratched the car parking in Alan's garage

4099
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:44,000
Because

4100
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:46,000
It's big city garages

4101
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:48,000
And they're very tight fits

4102
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:50,000
In the big cities

4103
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:52,000
As opposed to what I'm used to dealing with in Sacramento

4104
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:54,000
Where it's like giant four car garages

4105
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:56,000
Yeah, I got a big old scratch in the car now

4106
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:58,000
And I'm kind of upset about it

4107
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:00,000
My mistake, it's not Canada

4108
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:02,000
Even further away

4109
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:04,000
Because there's no Shanghai, Canada

4110
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:06,000
It's China

4111
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:08,000
They're shipping it from China

4112
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:10,000
Yeah, let's pick the furthest place

4113
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:12,000
From my location to ship this from

4114
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:14,000
That's probably where the damn thing's made

4115
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:16,000
I like that, that's awesome

4116
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:18,000
And by the way, because Apple's so wonderful

4117
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:20,000
And you know, in saving their costs

4118
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:22,000
They ship them separate

4119
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:24,000
The two items are actually separate

4120
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:26,000
Thank you

4121
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:28,000
Thank you for doing all that wonderful stuff for me

4122
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:30,000
Why are you mad though?

4123
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:35,000
Hey, more news, happy happy

4124
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:37,000
And then the Skype line's coming at you

4125
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:39,000
1877 Game OLR, not just yet

4126
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:41,000
I'll let you know when

4127
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:43,000
Yes, um

4128
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:45,000
So there's a brand new

4129
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:47,000
Overclock remix album

4130
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:49,000
That's coming out, you may remember the last one

4131
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:51,000
Was a remix album from Final Fantasy 7

4132
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:53,000
This time it's going to be

4133
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:56,000
A five part Final Fantasy 5 compilation

4134
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:58,000
Oh I get it

4135
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:00,000
Five parts, because it's five

4136
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:02,000
Ha

4137
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:04,000
It's called the Final Fantasy 5

4138
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:06,000
The Fabled Warriors

4139
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:08,000
An overclocked remix five part album series

4140
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:10,000
And um

4141
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:12,000
It is free

4142
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:14,000
Which is the best price

4143
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:16,000
And the first part of the five

4144
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:18,000
Is actually out now

4145
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:20,000
So you can go check it out

4146
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:22,000
And if you want to download that

4147
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:24,000
Go to

4148
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:26,000
wcremix.org

4149
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:30,000
Alright

4150
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:34,000
One more story for you guys, then we're going to open up the

4151
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:36,000
Skype line at 877 Game OLR

4152
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:38,000
Our username on Skype

4153
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:40,000
OrangeLoungeRadio

4154
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:42,000
Being asked in chat from floppy discourse

4155
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:44,000
What about Google Talk? Doesn't Google Talk let you call

4156
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:46,000
877 numbers now?

4157
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:48,000
Like you can call numbers in the US and Canada?

4158
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:50,000
You can actually call numbers?

4159
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:52,000
That's what I heard, yeah

4160
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:54,000
I'll keep my phone with Google

4161
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:56,000
Talk once I get

4162
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:58,000
I was going to get a prepaid phone

4163
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:00,000
Through like AT&T or something

4164
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:02,000
Like that

4165
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:04,000
But I don't like AT&T

4166
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:06,000
Because they're like, oh by the way there's all these fees

4167
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:08,000
We add on top of that

4168
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:10,000
Because I only would use like 12 minutes a month

4169
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:12,000
And I'd use their 25 cent

4170
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:14,000
Per minute plan or something like that

4171
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:16,000
But then they're like, oh we're going to add another dollar fee

4172
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:18,000
On there, oh and there's taxes, oh and there's this

4173
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:22,000
Oh and there's a convenience fee

4174
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:24,000
So I'll just go through Virgin

4175
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:26,000
Alright, one more story

4176
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:28,000
For you guys, do you know the name

4177
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:30,000
Chiaki Kuriyama?

4178
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:32,000
I hope you do

4179
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:34,000
Yeah I know the name

4180
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:36,000
She was in Kill Bill

4181
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,000
And she was in Battle Royale

4182
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:40,000
Correct

4183
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:42,000
She was Gogo Yubari in Kill Bill

4184
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:44,000
And then she was

4185
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:46,000
I don't remember the character's name

4186
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:48,000
She was in Battle Royale

4187
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:50,000
She was in both of those movies

4188
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:52,000
She was

4189
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:54,000
Not cock puncher

4190
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:56,000
She will soon be taking the role of

4191
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:58,000
Misuzu Asaki

4192
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:00,000
It's going to be the heroine of the new

4193
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:02,000
Yakuza game

4194
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:06,000
That's right, it's Yakuza Ryugagotoku of the End

4195
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:08,000
That's right, Sega revealed this week

4196
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:10,000
To IGN the fact that she is in the game

4197
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:12,000
There's going to be some images

4198
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:14,000
Compared here where you can actually

4199
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:16,000
See that the character in the game

4200
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:18,000
Looks like her too, which is kind of freaky

4201
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:20,000
She's a very pretty girl

4202
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:22,000
And the character looks like her

4203
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:24,000
Characters in other movies, very reminiscent

4204
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:26,000
Of Gogo Yubari

4205
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:28,000
So there it is, very cool

4206
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:30,000
There's some other characters in the game as well

4207
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:32,000
But no worry about who the voice actors are

4208
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:34,000
There will be lots and lots and lots of more

4209
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:36,000
Information at the Tokyo Game Show

4210
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:38,000
This actress does not

4211
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:40,000
Really act or speak in English

4212
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:42,000
As far as I know

4213
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:44,000
She doesn't play Japanese exclusive roles

4214
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:46,000
So don't expect this voice acting to come over to the US

4215
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:48,000
But for those of you guys that are really into

4216
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:50,000
The Yakuza series, like I know

4217
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:52,000
Deakman, who does our website, loves these games

4218
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:54,000
Probably will import it on Playstation 3

4219
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:56,000
Thanks to the region free stuff

4220
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:58,000
Can look forward to hearing her lovely voice

4221
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:00,000
As the heroine in that game

4222
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:02,000
Very cool

4223
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:04,000
Skypline is now open 1877 Game OLR

4224
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:06,000
Or our username on Skype

4225
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:08,000
Is OrangeLoungeRadio

4226
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:10,000
We're already getting calls, you ready for this?

4227
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:12,000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio

4228
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:14,000
Who's this?

4229
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:16,000
Hey, this is DJ Blaziken

4230
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:18,000
DJ Blaziken, what's on your mind?

4231
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:20,000
Not much

4232
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:22,000
Other than I got a little bit

4233
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:24,000
Of a similar situation

4234
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:26,000
That Loki kind of discussed

4235
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:28,000
A while back

4236
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:30,000
On an episode how he's

4237
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:32,000
Trying to stray away from the three-fret

4238
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:34,000
Formation

4239
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:36,000
Because he was a converger

4240
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:38,000
From guitar freaks to guitar hero

4241
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:40,000
Well, let's just say here

4242
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:42,000
I had the same excuse

4243
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:44,000
When I started playing guitar hero

4244
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:46,000
I'm like

4245
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:48,000
I cannot play medium, there's four notes

4246
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:50,000
There should only be three

4247
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:52,000
Aw, it wasn't that hard

4248
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:54,000
It wasn't that hard

4249
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:56,000
All it takes is

4250
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:58,000
Loki, one word

4251
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:00,000
Practice

4252
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:02,000
That's right, practice

4253
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:04,000
Yeah, but that also takes time

4254
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:06,000
And time I'm not willing to spend on that

4255
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:08,000
Okay

4256
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:10,000
I will say though, I recently

4257
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:12,000
Downloaded and played the

4258
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:14,000
DJ Hero 2 demo

4259
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:16,000
Oh, I forgot that's out

4260
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:18,000
I did half that

4261
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:20,000
You know what, those bastards didn't put it on PlayStation Network

4262
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:22,000
And my controller and gamer

4263
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:24,000
For PlayStation Network

4264
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:26,000
It's exclusive to Xbox 360

4265
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:28,000
Because we're Activision

4266
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:30,000
And we suck

4267
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:32,000
Well, okay

4268
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:34,000
I will say though, it is pretty cool

4269
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:36,000
On the factor

4270
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:38,000
Now they have the DJ battle mode

4271
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:40,000
Which is basically

4272
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:42,000
Okay, if you remember just

4273
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:44,000
Normal space off in Guitar Hero

4274
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:46,000
It's basically what this is for DJ Hero

4275
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:48,000
It's cool it is

4276
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:50,000
So, like, you do one part

4277
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:52,000
And then your player does another part

4278
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:54,000
And he goes back and forth

4279
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:56,000
I'm still wondering though if they're gonna do

4280
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:58,000
And I forgot to ask him when he was there

4281
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:00,000
If they're gonna do the guitar here

4282
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:02,000
Or the guitar DJ stuff again

4283
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:04,000
I remember how they had that

4284
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:06,000
By what I was seeing on the demo

4285
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:08,000
There wasn't anything for guitar and DJ

4286
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:10,000
It was mostly the vocals

4287
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:12,000
And DJ stuff

4288
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:14,000
And my father kind of found

4289
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:16,000
It kind of weird that I was singing

4290
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:18,000
The song, Don'tcha

4291
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:20,000
The Doncha remix

4292
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:22,000
And then the Lady Gaga remix

4293
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:24,000
It would have been cool though

4294
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:26,000
If they did that because they could have had vocals

4295
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:28,000
And they could have had guitars

4296
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:30,000
And then a DJ or something

4297
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:32,000
Man, that would be great

4298
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:34,000
For Loki to get that on YouTube

4299
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:36,000
Doing a Doncha

4300
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:38,000
You know what they really should have done

4301
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:40,000
But I'm sure they don't want to affect their

4302
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:42,000
DJ Hero sales

4303
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:44,000
You know how Rock Band 3

4304
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:46,000
Added keyboards have the next

4305
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:48,000
Guitar Hero game add turntables

4306
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:50,000
To the actual rock stuff

4307
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:54,000
How many songs really support that though?

4308
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:56,000
Not many, but it would be kind of neat though

4309
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:58,000
As in a little added download content

4310
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:00,000
How many songs support a guitar in DJ Hero?

4311
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:02,000
Not a lot, but it was pretty cool

4312
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:04,000
The ones that did

4313
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:06,000
And actually, do you know what

4314
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:08,000
Of all the weird things

4315
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:10,000
You know how you guys were talking about

4316
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:12,000
Learning the actual dance moves

4317
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:14,000
From Dance Central and whatnot

4318
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:16,000
Well, of all the weird things

4319
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:18,000
One of my

4320
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:20,000
One of my friends

4321
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:22,000
Went to a Macy's store and actually

4322
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:24,000
Went and tried out

4323
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:26,000
A thing with Dance Central

4324
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:28,000
And he showed me some of the moves

4325
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:30,000
To Lady Gaga's Poker Face

4326
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:32,000
And let's just say

4327
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:34,000
Here

4328
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:36,000
I think it was that or Just Dance that came on

4329
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:38,000
At Homecoming

4330
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:40,000
And we were actually pulling off

4331
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:42,000
The actual dance moves from the music video

4332
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:44,000
And

4333
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:46,000
Let's just say here, we were

4334
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:48,000
Getting questions asked, like

4335
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:50,000
How do you know the moves from the video?

4336
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:52,000
And you both got laid, right?

4337
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:54,000
Huh?

4338
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:56,000
Nothing

4339
02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:58,000
Basically, our answer was

4340
02:29:58,000 --> 02:30:00,000
We learned them from a video game

4341
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:02,000
And people just gave us a weird eye

4342
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:04,000
And it was the same thing

4343
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:06,000
It was the same thing we were doing

4344
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:08,000
Next time you need to say

4345
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:10,000
Private lessons

4346
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:12,000
Private lessons is your answer next time

4347
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:14,000
You know, it's not

4348
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:16,000
I mean, cause see a game like

4349
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:18,000
Even Just Dance, actually

4350
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:20,000
It's not, you know

4351
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:22,000
It shows you dance moves

4352
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:24,000
I would go repeating

4353
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:26,000
What was in there. Okay, let me play this way, Rob

4354
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:28,000
And this is just gonna make you want YouTube videos

4355
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:30,000
Of this even more

4356
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:32,000
I had, I picked some songs

4357
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:34,000
To play, you know, like I did

4358
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:36,000
Junior Seniors

4359
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:38,000
Move Your Feet, that was fun

4360
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:40,000
Um

4361
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:42,000
Wait, in Dance Central? No, not Dance Central

4362
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:44,000
In Just Dance 2

4363
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:46,000
I know that song

4364
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:48,000
From DDR Extreme back on the Playstation 2

4365
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:50,000
Which, that was the last

4366
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:52,000
Good one

4367
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:54,000
That was one of our first songs retired from the

4368
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:56,000
Cage match because the video was so awesome

4369
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:58,000
It is awesome

4370
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:00,000
Um, there's a song on there, I don't remember which

4371
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:02,000
Artist it is, but they have like a Tron guy

4372
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:04,000
Dancing in the background of

4373
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:06,000
Just Dance 2, but anyways

4374
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:08,000
As I was gonna say, I got to pick some songs

4375
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:10,000
And then the Ubisoft ref, she got to pick

4376
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:12,000
Some songs, and unfortunately she picked

4377
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:14,000
It's Raining Men

4378
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:16,000
So there is a video out there of me

4379
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:18,000
Trying to beat her

4380
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:20,000
At, you know, I was

4381
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:22,000
Trying to be more fabulous than she was

4382
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:24,000
I guess, at that

4383
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:26,000
But I got close, I did not beat

4384
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:28,000
Her though at that song, and thank god

4385
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:30,000
Because that would have been the only song that I actually beat her in

4386
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:32,000
And that would not be good either

4387
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:34,000
Sorry, I just need to hear a little bit of this song here

4388
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:46,000
This song is pretty amazing

4389
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:48,000
Too bad this band never really went anywhere

4390
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:50,000
But this song

4391
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:52,000
Hey, um, by the way

4392
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:54,000
Uh, on the factor, okay

4393
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:56,000
I figured out a way to sort of

4394
02:31:56,000 --> 02:31:58,000
Try to play Guitar Hero Rock Band

4395
02:31:58,000 --> 02:32:00,000
And, um, what else

4396
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:02,000
Rock Revolution

4397
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:04,000
To make the guitar point like guitar freaks

4398
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:06,000
In other words, all I've had to do

4399
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:08,000
Is flip my miniature

4400
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:10,000
Monitor like it's a 9 incher monitor

4401
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:12,000
Upside down

4402
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:14,000
Flip it to lefty mode

4403
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:16,000
And

4404
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:18,000
That's how I've been able to make it play like guitar freaks almost

4405
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:20,000
That is a lot of effort

4406
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:22,000
For such a little reward

4407
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:24,000
But hey, whatever makes you happy, dude

4408
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:26,000
Alright

4409
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:28,000
We gotta let you go to get some more calls, dude

4410
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:30,000
I'm sorry, I gotta cut you off

4411
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:32,000
Because we gotta get some more calls

4412
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:34,000
But thank you so much

4413
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:36,000
Hurry it up

4414
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:38,000
We actually did some DDR moves

4415
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:40,000
To, I think it was, um

4416
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:42,000
My Sharona

4417
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:44,000
Let's just say here, one or two

4418
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:46,000
Guys who said they might have heard your show

4419
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:48,000
Back in the day

4420
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:50,000
We should have been on Step Squad years ago

4421
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:52,000
Since you've been at DDR tournaments

4422
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:56,000
We've been watching a bunch of Mel B dance

4423
02:32:56,000 --> 02:32:58,000
Videos from tournaments

4424
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:00,000
Ah, alright

4425
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:02,000
Well, next time take an orange bat

4426
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:04,000
To prom, that's all I'm saying

4427
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:06,000
If you really want to represent the show

4428
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:08,000
Later

4429
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:10,000
1-877-GAME-OL-R

4430
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:12,000
If you wanna give us a call

4431
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:14,000
Or Orange Lawns Radio on Skype

4432
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:16,000
If you wanna give us a call that way, like this person is

4433
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:18,000
Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio, who's this?

4434
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:20,000
Hey, it's Ronma, what's up everyone

4435
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:22,000
Hey, Ronma, what's up?

4436
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:24,000
Not much, um

4437
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:26,000
To answer what you said about the Texas Instrument calculators

4438
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:28,000
Yeah, they're still making them

4439
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:30,000
And multiple models and flavors

4440
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:32,000
I just would have thought that, like

4441
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:34,000
They were on, like, model, like

4442
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:36,000
90-100 by now, you know what I mean?

4443
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:38,000
Like, instead of 82

4444
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:40,000
Well, my roommate has a TI-85

4445
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:42,000
But they don't make that one anymore

4446
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:44,000
From what I remember

4447
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:46,000
This is from, like, a few months ago

4448
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:48,000
They still make the 83, the 84

4449
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:50,000
84 Plus

4450
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:52,000
84 Plus Silver, the 89

4451
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:54,000
And one called the Nspire

4452
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:56,000
One size a scientific calculator

4453
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:58,000
You pull the keyboard out and you flip it over

4454
02:33:58,000 --> 02:34:00,000
It's like a mini computer

4455
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:02,000
That sounds like a sidekick or something, that's crazy

4456
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:04,000
And yeah, that thing's like

4457
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:06,000
200 bucks, and around this time

4458
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:08,000
In the year, the parents come in

4459
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:10,000
With the, um, with the list of

4460
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:12,000
Stuff that the kids need, and if they're taking

4461
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:14,000
Entry-level algebra math

4462
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:16,000
They're told that they need a

4463
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:18,000
TI calculator

4464
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:20,000
Now, who remembers the TI-99-4A?

4465
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:22,000
Anyone remember that?

4466
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:24,000
I had that

4467
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:26,000
That was a computer in the 1980s, the TI-99

4468
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:28,000
I had that

4469
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:30,000
With the big cartridge thing on the side

4470
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:32,000
Oh yeah, the big ol' cartridge slot that went on the side

4471
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:34,000
I have played so many games on that

4472
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:36,000
There's something that I need to find

4473
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:38,000
You want to get a TI-99

4474
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:40,000
Just for the heck of it?

4475
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:42,000
Just so you can play, like, Texas Invaders

4476
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:44,000
Wow

4477
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:46,000
Would that be Mexicans?

4478
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:48,000
No, it's a

4479
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:50,000
Space Invaders rip-off

4480
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:52,000
You dingbat

4481
02:34:52,000 --> 02:34:54,000
Alright, I'm sorry, that'd be Arizona Invaders

4482
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:56,000
Stop it

4483
02:34:56,000 --> 02:34:58,000
Alright

4484
02:34:58,000 --> 02:35:00,000
Well, thank you for the

4485
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:02,000
Update on calculators

4486
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:04,000
Glory to tell

4487
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:06,000
Alright, make it quick

4488
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:08,000
I was playing Scott Pilgrim vs. the World

4489
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:10,000
A couple of weeks ago

4490
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:12,000
And I was checking my scores on the leaderboards

4491
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:14,000
And I'm going to post a link in the chatroom

4492
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:16,000
Of a Twitpig, because this makes for great radio

4493
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:18,000
Now, the funny thing is

4494
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:20,000
If you look at it, I'm ranked

4495
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:22,000
Above someone called

4496
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:24,000
I'm a greedy Jew

4497
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:26,000
And I found it

4498
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:28,000
Slightly offensive

4499
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:30,000
So someone's game tag is I'm a greedy Jew

4500
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:32,000
Just to be fair, though, you're two slots

4501
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:34,000
Above I'm a greedy Jew, actually

4502
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:36,000
Two slots, yeah

4503
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:38,000
You're under

4504
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:40,000
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, you're five slots

4505
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:42,000
Under Yapathy

4506
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:46,000
I just find it

4507
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:48,000
Funny that when I first got Rock Band

4508
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:50,000
I went and I created my band

4509
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:52,000
Which was my roommate's idea, which was called

4510
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:54,000
Rhythm in Jews

4511
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:56,000
When I put it in, it said

4512
02:35:56,000 --> 02:35:58,000
And I quote

4513
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:00,000
Jews are banned on Xbox Live

4514
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:02,000
I think that was

4515
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:04,000
A programming issue

4516
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:06,000
I had to go and change the

4517
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:08,000
E to a 3

4518
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:10,000
Way so I can get on and play

4519
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:12,000
Well

4520
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:14,000
Did you report the name for being offensive?

4521
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:16,000
Because I'm thinking, you know, call

4522
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:18,000
Me crazy, but if Mount

4523
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:20,000
Gay or whatever, no, Fort Gay

4524
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:22,000
West Virginia is going to get banned

4525
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:24,000
I have a feeling I'm a greedy

4526
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:26,000
Jew might be

4527
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:28,000
Slightly offensive, and I don't think that's

4528
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:30,000
A town in, like, South Carolina or

4529
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:32,000
Anything, I'm pretty sure that guy's just

4530
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:34,000
A douchebag

4531
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:36,000
And I've seen a couple more names like that, so I popped

4532
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:38,000
In Rock Band 2, flipped the

4533
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:40,000
3 back to an E, and I had

4534
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:42,000
No problem going on live

4535
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:46,000
Whatever makes you happy

4536
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:48,000
I'm just amused by it, that's all

4537
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:50,000
It just amuses

4538
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:52,000
Me, that's all it is

4539
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:54,000
Alright, well I have to

4540
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:56,000
Now that we have one sitting in studio

4541
02:36:56,000 --> 02:36:58,000
I have to ask the official Jew of Orange Lawn

4542
02:36:58,000 --> 02:37:00,000
Radio Dark Sakura, are you offended by the

4543
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:02,000
Name I'm a Greedy Jew

4544
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:04,000
On Xbox Live?

4545
02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:06,000
I don't really

4546
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:08,000
Get offended, I think, by other people, really

4547
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:10,000
Because they're the ones who are stupid and

4548
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:12,000
Ignorant, and I'm not

4549
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:14,000
However, he could very likely

4550
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:16,000
Just admit all the, you know

4551
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:18,000
Perhaps he

4552
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:20,000
Admits that he's Jewish

4553
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:22,000
And happens to be a bit greedy

4554
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:24,000
That could be

4555
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:26,000
Maybe it's really SSJ-100 Matt

4556
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:28,000
However

4557
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:30,000
You called him into the show just to make that

4558
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:32,000
Joke, didn't you?

4559
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:34,000
Kinda, sorta

4560
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:36,000
However

4561
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:42,000
I mean

4562
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:46,000
I just have a hard time

4563
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:48,000
About being offended by other people's

4564
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:50,000
Ignorance

4565
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:52,000
They're just, they're poop

4566
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:54,000
They're being poopy

4567
02:37:54,000 --> 02:37:56,000
Why is that person worth my time?

4568
02:37:56,000 --> 02:37:58,000
You know

4569
02:37:58,000 --> 02:38:00,000
I think

4570
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:02,000
It's a symptom

4571
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:04,000
Of society

4572
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:06,000
And it's not, I don't think

4573
02:38:06,000 --> 02:38:08,000
It's funny

4574
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:10,000
I don't think it's funny at all

4575
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:12,000
And I'm sure it is intended to be

4576
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:14,000
Offensive

4577
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:16,000
But I would rather just not give them

4578
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:18,000
The satisfaction of being offended

4579
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:20,000
That's me

4580
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:22,000
Alright

4581
02:38:22,000 --> 02:38:24,000
Well, Rama, any other offensive things you wanna

4582
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:26,000
Bring to the attention of our little program?

4583
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:28,000
Baba Booey, Baba Booey

4584
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:30,000
Howard Stern

4585
02:38:30,000 --> 02:38:32,000
Bye, Rama

4586
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:36,000
1877 Game OLR

4587
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:38,000
Or our username on Skype is

4588
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:40,000
OrangeLoungeRadio if you care to venture that way

4589
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:42,000
We're taking your calls

4590
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:44,000
Live as we tape our show on this

4591
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:46,000
Lovely Sunday evening

4592
02:38:46,000 --> 02:38:48,000
Hot and ready to go

4593
02:38:48,000 --> 02:38:50,000
What? No

4594
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:52,000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio

4595
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:54,000
Clearly, hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio

4596
02:38:54,000 --> 02:38:56,000
Who's this?

4597
02:38:56,000 --> 02:38:58,000
Hey, can you guys hear me?

4598
02:38:58,000 --> 02:39:00,000
Yes we can, hi

4599
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:02,000
Hi, this is DDR Dollar Bill

4600
02:39:02,000 --> 02:39:04,000
DDR Dollar Bill, what's on your mind?

4601
02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:06,000
Not that much

4602
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:08,000
Two things, just real quick

4603
02:39:08,000 --> 02:39:10,000
That shows that hell is freezing over

4604
02:39:10,000 --> 02:39:12,000
First, I'm actually getting Halo Reach

4605
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:14,000
Oh my gosh, Halo Reach around

4606
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:16,000
For it?

4607
02:39:16,000 --> 02:39:18,000
Somewhat, only because it's the last game

4608
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:20,000
In the series apparently

4609
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:22,000
And I'm getting a $20 gift card from Best Buy

4610
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:24,000
So why not?

4611
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:26,000
Nice

4612
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:28,000
Yeah, just pretty much all the reasons

4613
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:30,000
I mean, I gotta multiplayer and end up cursing everybody out

4614
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:32,000
As usual

4615
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:34,000
But that's just the first sign

4616
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:36,000
And the second sign which is very

4617
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:38,000
I'm gonna ask everybody here for help is

4618
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:40,000
I'm also getting a Playstation 3

4619
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:42,000
By Christmas this year

4620
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:44,000
And the thing is

4621
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:46,000
The only really big condition is

4622
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:48,000
I need to get more games that are not

4623
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:50,000
That everybody can play

4624
02:39:50,000 --> 02:39:52,000
Not just myself

4625
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:54,000
Like party games

4626
02:39:54,000 --> 02:39:56,000
You could say that

4627
02:39:56,000 --> 02:39:58,000
Games are not like

4628
02:39:58,000 --> 02:40:00,000
What about the Playstation move?

4629
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:02,000
I mean, it's just gonna be a bunch of wee party

4630
02:40:02,000 --> 02:40:04,000
games on the move, any interest in that?

4631
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:06,000
Well, actually that

4632
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:08,000
Is the reason I'm getting it, first off

4633
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:10,000
For the move

4634
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:12,000
There you go right there

4635
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:14,000
Yeah

4636
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:16,000
I was just thinking

4637
02:40:16,000 --> 02:40:18,000
I was just thinking more games

4638
02:40:18,000 --> 02:40:20,000
Than just the move games

4639
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:22,000
You know, something else

4640
02:40:22,000 --> 02:40:24,000
The SingStar franchise is always a good

4641
02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:26,000
Party starter, that's really popular at parties

4642
02:40:26,000 --> 02:40:28,000
Because it's like karaoke, one of the

4643
02:40:28,000 --> 02:40:30,000
Karaoke games, it's a little different from

4644
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:32,000
Rock Band in those games because A, it's exclusively

4645
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:34,000
Singing and lets you do duets and stuff

4646
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:36,000
And B, it actually shows the actual music videos

4647
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:38,000
In the background, which I think is kind of a nice

4648
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:40,000
Touch, especially for people that aren't as familiar

4649
02:40:40,000 --> 02:40:42,000
With video games, it's like, suddenly you have a

4650
02:40:42,000 --> 02:40:44,000
Karaoke bar in your house, so that's all

4651
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:46,000
Interesting, you know, in that regard, those are

4652
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:48,000
Always fun games, what else?

4653
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:50,000
Fun party games on the

4654
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:52,000
Playstation 3 or multiplayer

4655
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:54,000
Events, Little Big Planet

4656
02:40:54,000 --> 02:40:56,000
Absolutely, is a Playstation 3

4657
02:40:56,000 --> 02:40:58,000
Exclusive, up to four people can play that game

4658
02:40:58,000 --> 02:41:00,000
At once, online or in the same house

4659
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:02,000
Modulation Racers, oh that's a good one too

4660
02:41:02,000 --> 02:41:04,000
That's a good one for multiplayer, can you

4661
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:06,000
Do, does it have split screens, you can do that all?

4662
02:41:06,000 --> 02:41:08,000
I believe it does

4663
02:41:08,000 --> 02:41:10,000
Nice, very nice

4664
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:12,000
What are the fun little party games?

4665
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:14,000
Blur, I don't know

4666
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:16,000
I'm trying to think of things that are exclusive

4667
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:18,000
Because you said you had a 360, right?

4668
02:41:18,000 --> 02:41:20,000
There is Buzz

4669
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:22,000
Oh, Buzz is

4670
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:24,000
Very popular for parties, that's the game

4671
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:26,000
Showy game, when it comes to the special

4672
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:28,000
Controllers that are just like the A, B, C and D

4673
02:41:28,000 --> 02:41:30,000
Answers, and people who write their own

4674
02:41:30,000 --> 02:41:32,000
Questions and everything, that is a big

4675
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:34,000
Big party game, for multiplayer

4676
02:41:34,000 --> 02:41:36,000
You can write in your own questions?

4677
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:38,000
Yes you can, that's what I hear

4678
02:41:38,000 --> 02:41:40,000
Yeah, I know right

4679
02:41:40,000 --> 02:41:42,000
Apparently they, I don't

4680
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:44,000
Know if you can straight up

4681
02:41:44,000 --> 02:41:46,000
Do your, I don't have the game personally, I don't know

4682
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:48,000
If you can straight up do your own questions and play

4683
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:50,000
A game locally with those questions you wrote

4684
02:41:50,000 --> 02:41:52,000
But I know like people are able to submit

4685
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:54,000
Questions to like official question packs

4686
02:41:54,000 --> 02:41:56,000
And things, I've heard of this, I don't

4687
02:41:56,000 --> 02:41:58,000
Know, again I don't own the game myself

4688
02:41:58,000 --> 02:42:00,000
So I'm not sure of all the details and how it works

4689
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:02,000
All my own questions? That'd be great

4690
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:04,000
Like an OLR trivia pack

4691
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:06,000
Would anyone play that? I don't know

4692
02:42:06,000 --> 02:42:08,000
Alright, so I guess those are our

4693
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:10,000
Suggestions, so let us know what you end

4694
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:12,000
Up buying and if you have fun with it

4695
02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:14,000
I definitely will guys

4696
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:16,000
Alright, well have fun with PlayStation 3

4697
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:18,000
Keep on gaming

4698
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:20,000
And we'll talk to you later, okay?

4699
02:42:20,000 --> 02:42:22,000
Alright, be good guys

4700
02:42:22,000 --> 02:42:24,000
Later, we'll try

4701
02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:26,000
That's gonna do it for the Skype line tonight

4702
02:42:26,000 --> 02:42:28,000
Sorry for those guys that didn't get through, but be sure to

4703
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:30,000
Always leave us an email

4704
02:42:30,000 --> 02:42:32,000
OrangeLoungeRadio.com or

4705
02:42:32,000 --> 02:42:34,000
Our Twitter, Twitter.com slash OLR

4706
02:42:34,000 --> 02:42:36,000
And so forth

4707
02:42:36,000 --> 02:42:38,000
Loki, do you have any last minute stories you want to get to tonight?

4708
02:42:38,000 --> 02:42:40,000
It's not a lot tonight

4709
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:42,000
One is that there's a rumor

4710
02:42:42,000 --> 02:42:44,000
That the Nintendo DS, or not the DS

4711
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:46,000
The 3DS will be out

4712
02:42:46,000 --> 02:42:48,000
In Japan in November

4713
02:42:48,000 --> 02:42:50,000
This is coming from a company called

4714
02:42:50,000 --> 02:42:52,000
Keys Factory

4715
02:42:52,000 --> 02:42:54,000
Yeah, Keys Factory, they design

4716
02:42:54,000 --> 02:42:56,000
A bunch of DS,

4717
02:42:56,000 --> 02:42:58,000
DSi, DSi, XL

4718
02:42:58,000 --> 02:43:00,000
Peripherals

4719
02:43:00,000 --> 02:43:02,000
And apparently this is coming from

4720
02:43:02,000 --> 02:43:04,000
Their Twitter

4721
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:06,000
And it was saying that

4722
02:43:08,000 --> 02:43:10,000
Let's see here

4723
02:43:10,000 --> 02:43:12,000
It was saying November 20th is when they're expecting

4724
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:14,000
The system out

4725
02:43:14,000 --> 02:43:16,000
So

4726
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:18,000
That's interesting, it says on November 20th

4727
02:43:18,000 --> 02:43:20,000
11 3DS

4728
02:43:20,000 --> 02:43:22,000
Products that we designed to go on sale

4729
02:43:22,000 --> 02:43:24,000
All at once, people who are buying 3DS

4730
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:26,000
Buy it at the same time

4731
02:43:26,000 --> 02:43:28,000
There'll be more details on our homepage

4732
02:43:28,000 --> 02:43:30,000
So

4733
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:32,000
It's interesting, maybe they'll announce that

4734
02:43:32,000 --> 02:43:34,000
At Tokyo Game Show, since it's right around the corner

4735
02:43:34,000 --> 02:43:36,000
Actually no, I don't think

4736
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:38,000
They actually are at Tokyo Game Show

4737
02:43:38,000 --> 02:43:40,000
Well, maybe around the same time

4738
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:42,000
They usually do their own Nintendo thing

4739
02:43:42,000 --> 02:43:44,000
So that's that

4740
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:46,000
And then Knights in the Nightmare

4741
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:48,000
A game that was originally out on the Nintendo DS

4742
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:50,000
From Atlus

4743
02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:52,000
It's coming to the PSP

4744
02:43:52,000 --> 02:43:54,000
And kind of as an added bonus

4745
02:43:54,000 --> 02:43:56,000
They are going to be giving you

4746
02:43:56,000 --> 02:43:58,000
A copy, a digital copy that is

4747
02:43:58,000 --> 02:44:00,000
Of, and I cannot

4748
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:02,000
Pronounce this, but we're going to try

4749
02:44:02,000 --> 02:44:04,000
Looks like

4750
02:44:04,000 --> 02:44:06,000
Yggdras

4751
02:44:06,000 --> 02:44:08,000
Union, I guess

4752
02:44:08,000 --> 02:44:10,000
Y-G-G-D-R-A

4753
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:12,000
And

4754
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:14,000
That's going to be in every

4755
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:16,000
Copy, every launch copy of

4756
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:18,000
Knights in the Nightmare, but knowing

4757
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:20,000
Atlus, that will be all the copies of

4758
02:44:20,000 --> 02:44:22,000
Knights in the Nightmare on PSP

4759
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:24,000
They're scheduled to come out

4760
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:26,000
November 9th

4761
02:44:26,000 --> 02:44:28,000
So that's kind of cool

4762
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:30,000
And

4763
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:32,000
That'd be it

4764
02:44:32,000 --> 02:44:34,000
Wow, this is kind of slow on the last minute

4765
02:44:34,000 --> 02:44:36,000
Yeah, it's pretty, pretty dead

4766
02:44:36,000 --> 02:44:38,000
Alright

4767
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:40,000
Well, that's going to do it for this week's episode

4768
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:42,000
Of Orange Lounge Radio, but not before we get around

4769
02:44:42,000 --> 02:44:44,000
And get everybody's final thought

4770
02:44:44,000 --> 02:44:46,000
Uh, DarkSakura, do you have a final thought tonight?

4771
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:48,000
Suebooks!

4772
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:50,000
Can we please make that the fortune cookie message tonight?

4773
02:44:50,000 --> 02:44:52,000
I don't know what you had picked, but

4774
02:44:52,000 --> 02:44:54,000
Okay, okay, okay

4775
02:44:54,000 --> 02:44:56,000
Alright, thank you

4776
02:44:56,000 --> 02:44:58,000
Let me pick one once in a while

4777
02:44:58,000 --> 02:45:00,000
I had Lewis Black, so

4778
02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:02,000
We'll roll him over to next week, you won't mind

4779
02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:04,000
Alright

4780
02:45:04,000 --> 02:45:06,000
Loki, your final thought tonight?

4781
02:45:06,000 --> 02:45:08,000
I don't catch that reference

4782
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:10,000
You will soon

4783
02:45:10,000 --> 02:45:12,000
Is that it for your final

4784
02:45:12,000 --> 02:45:14,000
I don't get it

4785
02:45:14,000 --> 02:45:16,000
Hopefully I'll have a connect in

4786
02:45:16,000 --> 02:45:18,000
Two weeks

4787
02:45:18,000 --> 02:45:20,000
Alright

4788
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:22,000
Cross my fingers

4789
02:45:22,000 --> 02:45:24,000
My final thought is

4790
02:45:24,000 --> 02:45:26,000
I don't know

4791
02:45:26,000 --> 02:45:28,000
Hi, that's my final thought

4792
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:30,000
I don't know

4793
02:45:30,000 --> 02:45:32,000
Bye, that's my final thought

4794
02:45:32,000 --> 02:45:34,000
Bye, have a great week everybody

4795
02:45:34,000 --> 02:45:36,000
We'll see you next time here at Orange Lounge Radio

4796
02:45:36,000 --> 02:45:38,000
We'll do it all again next week

4797
02:45:38,000 --> 02:45:40,000
Live promptly at 6 o'clock next week

4798
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:42,000
Bobby is not on next week

4799
02:45:42,000 --> 02:45:44,000
But we will still be here on September the 19th

4800
02:45:44,000 --> 02:45:46,000
At 6 o'clock

4801
02:45:46,000 --> 02:45:48,000

02:45:48,000 --> 02:45:50,000

4807

Viva la independent radio

4808
02:46:00,000 --> 02:46:02,000
