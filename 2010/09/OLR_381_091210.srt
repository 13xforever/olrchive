1
00:00:14,282 --> 00:00:19,184
[SPEAKER_01]: Tonight, September 12, 2010, the Need for Speed MMO is set to go free.

2
00:00:19,524 --> 00:00:21,985
[SPEAKER_01]: Could digital distribution soon come to arcades?

3
00:00:22,405 --> 00:00:25,266
[SPEAKER_01]: And the next Guitar Hero game is set to invade your Twitter.

4
00:00:31,792 --> 00:00:36,415
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:36,495 --> 00:00:42,239
[SPEAKER_03]: We are that show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle, all of it.

6
00:00:42,279 --> 00:00:44,540
[SPEAKER_03]: We're the place where every gamer has a voice.

7
00:00:44,981 --> 00:00:51,705
[SPEAKER_03]: And leading the charge over the next few hours are myself, Rob Roberts, and with me as always, the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

8
00:00:52,045 --> 00:00:52,886
[SPEAKER_03]: Om nom noms.

9
00:00:52,966 --> 00:00:53,566
[SPEAKER_03]: Om nom nom.

10
00:00:53,606 --> 00:00:53,967
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you?

11
00:00:54,607 --> 00:00:55,247
[SPEAKER_03]: Om nom nom.

12
00:00:55,448 --> 00:00:57,229
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge Foodio going on over there.

13
00:00:57,809 --> 00:00:58,870
[SPEAKER_08]: I slept most of the day.

14
00:00:59,290 --> 00:00:59,530
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

15
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:00,711
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge Nappio.

16
00:01:03,953 --> 00:01:06,074
[SPEAKER_03]: I took an awesome nap yesterday, actually.

17
00:01:06,174 --> 00:01:07,555
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's how I was able to stay up late.

18
00:01:07,595 --> 00:01:08,776
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I went clubbing.

19
00:01:09,196 --> 00:01:10,817
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was able to stay up until like 2 a.m.

20
00:01:10,837 --> 00:01:11,277
[SPEAKER_03]: It was fun.

21
00:01:11,417 --> 00:01:12,558
[SPEAKER_08]: It sounds like you had a good time.

22
00:01:12,858 --> 00:01:13,699
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a great time.

23
00:01:13,779 --> 00:01:17,741
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just very proud of myself because I used the cucumber that I grew myself.

24
00:01:19,002 --> 00:01:21,063
[SPEAKER_08]: And I made myself some salad.

25
00:01:21,263 --> 00:01:22,524
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's fantastic.

26
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:26,026
[SPEAKER_03]: Soon you're going to be moving into a commune and starting your own...

27
00:01:26,346 --> 00:01:32,852
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I have five plants that I'm growing in the backyard and three of them are like stuff to season with.

28
00:01:32,953 --> 00:01:33,733
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember the fort?

29
00:01:34,714 --> 00:01:35,135
[SPEAKER_08]: The fort?

30
00:01:35,255 --> 00:01:35,775
[SPEAKER_03]: The fort.

31
00:01:35,935 --> 00:01:38,478
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, oh, this was years ago in OLR history.

32
00:01:38,498 --> 00:01:41,541
[SPEAKER_03]: This was probably around like when DDR Angel first started coming to the show.

33
00:01:41,581 --> 00:01:43,943
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably around like episode like 30-ish, right?

34
00:01:43,963 --> 00:01:44,204
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

35
00:01:44,564 --> 00:01:46,526
[SPEAKER_03]: And she had a friend and...

36
00:01:47,935 --> 00:01:49,256
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't remember the dude's name.

37
00:01:49,316 --> 00:01:50,977
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a horrible... Well, I remember his real name.

38
00:01:50,997 --> 00:01:52,178
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to say it on the show.

39
00:01:52,238 --> 00:01:59,942
[SPEAKER_03]: It was D-U... Yeah, I think I remember because I think... But he lived out in the middle of nowhere, right?

40
00:02:00,062 --> 00:02:08,267
[SPEAKER_03]: And to get to his house, you had to go by this place in the middle of nowhere with all these signs that were like, keep out and trespassers will be shot on sight.

41
00:02:08,307 --> 00:02:12,270
[SPEAKER_03]: And it just looked like some dude has had himself holed up in there since the 60s.

42
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:14,031
[SPEAKER_03]: And we decided to call that the OLR Fort.

43
00:02:14,171 --> 00:02:14,311
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

44
00:02:14,331 --> 00:02:16,052
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's who we're all going to move into, remember?

45
00:02:16,072 --> 00:02:16,152
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

46
00:02:16,152 --> 00:02:17,813
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think we screwed with it at all.

47
00:02:17,973 --> 00:02:18,814
[SPEAKER_07]: Are we guys hearing Loki?

48
00:02:43,846 --> 00:02:44,026
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm tired.

49
00:03:08,081 --> 00:03:09,302
[SPEAKER_03]: I plugged it in the out hole.

50
00:03:09,562 --> 00:03:10,222
[SPEAKER_03]: Oops.

51
00:03:10,922 --> 00:03:11,483
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what happens.

52
00:03:11,643 --> 00:03:12,543
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, happy birthday.

53
00:03:12,603 --> 00:03:13,124
[SPEAKER_03]: A little late.

54
00:03:13,344 --> 00:03:13,684
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

55
00:03:13,804 --> 00:03:14,324
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

56
00:03:14,644 --> 00:03:15,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Never forget.

57
00:03:15,465 --> 00:03:17,065
[SPEAKER_03]: September 11th, Loki's birthday.

58
00:03:17,706 --> 00:03:19,787
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm being a little bit silly.

59
00:03:19,827 --> 00:03:22,068
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't have any tragedies on your birthday, do you?

60
00:03:23,389 --> 00:03:24,709
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but I do have a victory.

61
00:03:24,909 --> 00:03:27,851
[SPEAKER_03]: My birthday, there's two reasons my birthday rocks.

62
00:03:28,811 --> 00:03:30,672
[SPEAKER_03]: One, it's the day that Strom Thurmond died.

63
00:03:31,993 --> 00:03:34,794
[SPEAKER_03]: And B, it's the day that sodomy laws were overturned in Texas.

64
00:03:35,354 --> 00:03:36,535
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I get on my birthday.

65
00:03:36,855 --> 00:03:38,717
[SPEAKER_08]: See, my birthday was the Waco thing.

66
00:03:39,117 --> 00:03:39,578
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, was it?

67
00:03:39,718 --> 00:03:39,998
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

68
00:03:40,339 --> 00:03:40,459
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

69
00:03:40,839 --> 00:03:43,162
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no tragedies on my birthday yet, just victories.

70
00:03:43,562 --> 00:03:43,862
[SPEAKER_04]: Bitch.

71
00:03:44,103 --> 00:03:48,507
[SPEAKER_04]: So, talking about something funny made out of tragedy, I guess.

72
00:03:49,648 --> 00:03:59,919
[SPEAKER_04]: There's this pet and feed store that's near my house or whatever, and they have this horse statue that's out in front of, like a full-size horse statue that's out in front of their building.

73
00:04:00,259 --> 00:04:05,082
[SPEAKER_04]: And they dress it up for Halloween or St.

74
00:04:05,142 --> 00:04:07,143
[SPEAKER_04]: Paddy's Day, all the different stuff.

75
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:08,424
[SPEAKER_04]: They dress it up themed like that.

76
00:04:09,304 --> 00:04:12,666
[SPEAKER_04]: So they decided, hey, we're going to dress it up for 9-11.

77
00:04:13,307 --> 00:04:19,431
[SPEAKER_04]: And so this horse has a replica of the Twin Towers on its back.

78
00:04:20,271 --> 00:04:20,851
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like...

79
00:04:22,072 --> 00:04:23,312
[SPEAKER_03]: That almost sounds tacky.

80
00:04:23,852 --> 00:04:25,353
[SPEAKER_03]: It is extremely tacky.

81
00:04:25,413 --> 00:04:26,733
[SPEAKER_03]: I get wanting to be patriotic.

82
00:04:26,773 --> 00:04:33,855
[SPEAKER_03]: And I do think they kind of should make a day out of 9-11 as a remembrance and a day to kind of celebrate all things American.

83
00:04:33,895 --> 00:04:36,636
[SPEAKER_03]: Although I realize it's also like the 4th of July as it is.

84
00:04:36,656 --> 00:04:37,196
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know what I mean?

85
00:04:37,556 --> 00:04:42,177
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, it's too bad that that had to happen on your birthday.

86
00:04:42,217 --> 00:04:44,818
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's just, you know, some people are born on Christmas.

87
00:04:45,298 --> 00:04:49,199
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people are born on, you know, the day sodomy laws are repealed.

88
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:50,619
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people are born...

89
00:04:51,019 --> 00:05:05,974
[SPEAKER_03]: on 9-11 and you know it's just a birthday yeah what can you do at least if you're born on Easter you don't always have to have it again on Easter true or if you're born February 29th you get to stay young for a very long time even though you look really old for your age yes

90
00:05:06,843 --> 00:05:07,443
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, anyhow.

91
00:05:08,764 --> 00:05:10,946
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's start, I guess, with a little bit of How's Your Gaming Week.

92
00:05:10,966 --> 00:05:12,106
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I should say about the marathon.

93
00:05:12,146 --> 00:05:13,287
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to thank the listeners for stuff.

94
00:05:13,307 --> 00:05:14,308
[SPEAKER_03]: The marathon was awesome.

95
00:05:14,788 --> 00:05:17,330
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you haven't heard it all, it's all up on the feed now.

96
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:19,711
[SPEAKER_03]: We went for 10 and a half hours live.

97
00:05:19,731 --> 00:05:23,854
[SPEAKER_03]: When you take out the music, it was about 9 hours, 30, 40 minutes worth of podcast.

98
00:05:24,294 --> 00:05:24,995
[SPEAKER_03]: And good times.

99
00:05:25,055 --> 00:05:28,297
[SPEAKER_03]: And we didn't end up playing any games live on air like we thought we were going to.

100
00:05:28,697 --> 00:05:31,078
[SPEAKER_03]: So, just really good times.

101
00:05:31,359 --> 00:05:32,039
[SPEAKER_08]: We did match games.

102
00:05:32,219 --> 00:05:33,660
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no, I meant video games.

103
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:34,441
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, oh.

104
00:05:34,521 --> 00:05:35,582
[SPEAKER_03]: Not the OLR games.

105
00:05:35,922 --> 00:05:37,943
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I mean, and big thanks to Alan and Bradley too.

106
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:38,604
[SPEAKER_03]: Dan sure did.

107
00:05:38,624 --> 00:05:39,204
[SPEAKER_03]: Without their help.

108
00:05:39,744 --> 00:05:39,985
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Dan.

109
00:05:40,005 --> 00:05:41,506
[SPEAKER_08]: He played the game that shall not be named.

110
00:05:41,566 --> 00:05:42,607
[SPEAKER_03]: For a very long time.

111
00:05:43,207 --> 00:05:45,829
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, he was playing the Reach Around game for some time.

112
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,761
[SPEAKER_08]: He and his friend.

113
00:05:49,622 --> 00:05:50,963
[SPEAKER_03]: He and Alex were playing Reach Around.

114
00:05:51,323 --> 00:05:52,604
[SPEAKER_03]: Has he finished the game yet?

115
00:05:52,724 --> 00:05:53,585
[SPEAKER_08]: I have no idea.

116
00:05:53,665 --> 00:06:00,229
[SPEAKER_08]: Dan left for Washington State to go spend like eight days with his family and leave me here by my heel.

117
00:06:00,469 --> 00:06:00,930
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, whatever.

118
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:03,872
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to run around the house naked and play Star Trek online.

119
00:06:03,992 --> 00:06:04,973
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I do anyway.

120
00:06:06,994 --> 00:06:07,755
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

121
00:06:28,428 --> 00:06:29,249
[SPEAKER_08]: I wasn't naked.

122
00:06:30,069 --> 00:06:37,233
[SPEAKER_08]: I was playing Star Trek Online when Rob came in, and I actually stopped in the middle of the part that I was on, because when I start the game, I'll just start right back from where I am.

123
00:06:37,553 --> 00:06:39,714
[SPEAKER_08]: Which is a very good thing about Star Trek Online.

124
00:06:40,455 --> 00:06:43,536
[SPEAKER_08]: Unless you're right at the beginning of it, and you're almost done with the first part, and then you die.

125
00:06:43,636 --> 00:06:44,757
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway.

126
00:06:46,438 --> 00:06:48,119
[SPEAKER_08]: I played Peggle.

127
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:51,501
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I haven't touched Epic Citadel since I downloaded it, except to upgrade it.

128
00:06:53,043 --> 00:06:56,231
[SPEAKER_08]: And I really haven't done much else in the way of gaming.

129
00:06:57,193 --> 00:06:58,155
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Dan got...

130
00:07:02,436 --> 00:07:02,936
[SPEAKER_08]: Dead Rising 2.

131
00:07:03,597 --> 00:07:07,178
[SPEAKER_08]: I always want to say Left 4 Dead, but it's Dead Rising 2, the Mission Zero.

132
00:07:07,198 --> 00:07:07,599
[SPEAKER_03]: Case Zero.

133
00:07:07,799 --> 00:07:09,079
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, yeah, Case Zero.

134
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:13,902
[SPEAKER_08]: And he's gotten all of the endings, except, man, the bad ending where the little girl turns into a zombie.

135
00:07:14,702 --> 00:07:15,823
[SPEAKER_03]: OMG, spoilers.

136
00:07:15,963 --> 00:07:16,463
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't care.

137
00:07:17,624 --> 00:07:23,087
[SPEAKER_08]: If you haven't downloaded it yet, and if you haven't got there by now, then I don't want to hear it.

138
00:07:23,487 --> 00:07:24,627
[SPEAKER_03]: Plus, it's kind of obvious.

139
00:07:24,767 --> 00:07:26,728
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't even show her turning into a zombie.

140
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:28,528
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, she's a child.

141
00:07:28,809 --> 00:07:29,289
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't care.

142
00:07:29,389 --> 00:07:30,889
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanted to see a zombie five-year-old.

143
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:34,550
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry you were disappointed.

144
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:36,691
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's like when you watch zombie movies.

145
00:07:36,851 --> 00:07:37,571
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, okay.

146
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:39,511
[SPEAKER_08]: When you watch zombie movies, right?

147
00:07:39,952 --> 00:07:49,674
[SPEAKER_08]: Shouldn't there be, like, zombie dogs and children and zombie old people and, you know, and, like, zombies in wheelchairs and... Well, actually, there was in Shaun of the Dead.

148
00:07:50,194 --> 00:07:52,115
[SPEAKER_03]: I suppose it depends on how graphic you want to get.

149
00:07:54,405 --> 00:07:56,568
[SPEAKER_08]: and all the people in hospitals turning into zombies and stuff.

150
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:59,874
[SPEAKER_08]: It just doesn't make sense to me.

151
00:08:02,496 --> 00:08:04,578
[SPEAKER_08]: I also have that problem with zombie video games.

152
00:08:04,698 --> 00:08:05,419
[SPEAKER_08]: It was pretty cool though.

153
00:08:05,779 --> 00:08:17,808
[SPEAKER_08]: Especially my favorite weapon that you can make in that game is you can get a pitchfork and attach it to a rifle and then you can stab them with the pitchfork, pull them up in the air and shoot them with the shotgun and they'll explode.

154
00:08:18,008 --> 00:08:18,608
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.

155
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:22,271
[SPEAKER_08]: And you can also go to this place and get a broadsword and slice zombies down the middle.

156
00:08:22,772 --> 00:08:24,353
[SPEAKER_08]: And you can make the nail bat and everything.

157
00:08:24,413 --> 00:08:26,675
[SPEAKER_08]: But man, the pitchfork bayonet

158
00:08:27,675 --> 00:08:28,455
[SPEAKER_08]: That's innovation.

159
00:08:28,696 --> 00:08:35,398
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't figured out any weapon combinations outside of the nails and bat only because I was specifically shown that at E3.

160
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:36,899
[SPEAKER_03]: How to do that.

161
00:08:37,139 --> 00:08:38,219
[SPEAKER_03]: Pitchfork, rifle.

162
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:42,041
[SPEAKER_04]: You try to figure stuff out and then also you get cards.

163
00:08:42,921 --> 00:08:45,382
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can take all that stuff into the main game later on.

164
00:08:45,683 --> 00:08:47,063
[SPEAKER_08]: And it even has a dude throwing up.

165
00:08:48,684 --> 00:08:48,984
[SPEAKER_04]: Hooray?

166
00:08:50,034 --> 00:08:53,995
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you can tape him to a cat, and he becomes a weapon, right?

167
00:08:55,256 --> 00:08:56,816
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do love that idea.

168
00:08:57,136 --> 00:09:14,181
[SPEAKER_03]: It certainly seems one step past the Fable 2 pub games, which was a neat little innovation in itself, but this is kind of like taking it to the next level, where now a game's demo is actually a whole different game, and yeah, you pay for it, but it's kind of a standalone experience, and you get to take what you've earned into the main game.

169
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:14,761
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of neat.

170
00:09:14,901 --> 00:09:16,142
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's got three different endings.

171
00:09:16,402 --> 00:09:17,903
[SPEAKER_03]: It's reverse DLC.

172
00:09:18,584 --> 00:09:21,406
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not download content to expand the game.

173
00:09:21,546 --> 00:09:23,628
[SPEAKER_03]: It's download content to begin the game.

174
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,570
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very strange, but I like it.

175
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:26,971
[SPEAKER_08]: It was really cool.

176
00:09:28,652 --> 00:09:33,356
[SPEAKER_08]: When Dan did one of the bad endings, he had the dude with a mohawk wearing a waitress dress.

177
00:09:34,317 --> 00:09:35,638
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was like, okay, that's pretty funny.

178
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:39,741
[SPEAKER_08]: Because you see this burly guy walking in wearing this dress.

179
00:09:39,781 --> 00:09:40,161
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm like...

180
00:09:40,922 --> 00:09:42,323
[SPEAKER_08]: And then falling to his knees.

181
00:09:42,563 --> 00:09:45,225
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't wait to see some of the hideous costumes you can put the main character in.

182
00:09:45,245 --> 00:09:51,110
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I'll tell you what, some of the best parts of the first one were some of the really skanky costumes you could put Frank West into.

183
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:52,231
[SPEAKER_03]: Like putting them in children's clothing?

184
00:09:52,351 --> 00:09:52,611
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

185
00:09:53,392 --> 00:09:54,312
[SPEAKER_03]: In the Mega Man outfit.

186
00:09:54,572 --> 00:09:56,414
[SPEAKER_08]: This one's set in Las Vegas, isn't it?

187
00:09:56,654 --> 00:09:56,854
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

188
00:09:57,254 --> 00:10:01,758
[SPEAKER_08]: So we need to have the whole showgirls, you know, big fan tale.

189
00:10:01,878 --> 00:10:03,359
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have to go find Tiara Zombie.

190
00:10:03,599 --> 00:10:03,719
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

191
00:10:03,739 --> 00:10:07,082
[SPEAKER_03]: Because she lives in Vegas and will undoubtedly be a zombie in the game.

192
00:10:07,562 --> 00:10:10,024
[SPEAKER_08]: We won't aim for the head on the tiara zombie.

193
00:10:10,064 --> 00:10:13,447
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I'll refrain from using the pitchfork bayonetta on tiara.

194
00:10:13,787 --> 00:10:16,909
[SPEAKER_03]: What I'll do, I'll put a cardboard box on her head and just watch her run around.

195
00:10:18,438 --> 00:10:21,941
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll keep her in the garden playing PS2 games like in Shaun of the Dead.

196
00:10:22,161 --> 00:10:24,103
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't wait to see what kind of comment we get from her.

197
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:25,884
[SPEAKER_03]: Because she's on AOL during the show, right?

198
00:10:26,185 --> 00:10:26,705
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I don't know.

199
00:10:26,905 --> 00:10:28,006
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to ask her.

200
00:10:28,026 --> 00:10:28,487
[SPEAKER_03]: She's listening.

201
00:10:28,847 --> 00:10:29,047
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

202
00:10:29,688 --> 00:10:29,908
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

203
00:10:29,948 --> 00:10:32,230
[SPEAKER_03]: Going to our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

204
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:33,211
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

205
00:10:33,231 --> 00:10:37,474
[SPEAKER_03]: A hit stun suggests a cat gun to which Actdeft is saying laser cat gun.

206
00:10:38,034 --> 00:10:39,035
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be a great weapon.

207
00:10:39,215 --> 00:10:40,757
[SPEAKER_06]: I could see using a laser cat.

208
00:10:40,797 --> 00:10:41,858
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be amazing.

209
00:10:41,998 --> 00:10:42,378
[SPEAKER_03]: Perhaps.

210
00:10:43,899 --> 00:10:45,340
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

211
00:10:46,341 --> 00:10:57,370
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm pretty eventful actually because we did our game summit thing at our work where we invite publishers and some of our customers out and we did it this year kind of expo style I guess.

212
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:01,533
[SPEAKER_04]: Each publisher had a different booth for the ones that showed up.

213
00:11:01,933 --> 00:11:07,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that many brought games though even though I offered them like hey if you need to borrow a 360 or something I can help you out with that.

214
00:11:09,139 --> 00:11:14,263
[SPEAKER_04]: So I only played really like a few different things and

215
00:11:14,503 --> 00:11:17,766
[SPEAKER_04]: The first one, and there is a video out there of it somewhere.

216
00:11:18,286 --> 00:11:19,447
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to know where though.

217
00:11:20,508 --> 00:11:23,811
[SPEAKER_04]: The first game I played this week was Just Dance 2.

218
00:11:24,812 --> 00:11:31,177
[SPEAKER_04]: And only because the Ubisoft rep wanted to demonstrate it and no one would play it.

219
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:32,378
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was like, okay, fine.

220
00:11:33,339 --> 00:11:35,060
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll do this and be a good sport about it.

221
00:11:36,261 --> 00:11:38,723
[SPEAKER_04]: So I did that and she kicked my ass in every single song.

222
00:11:39,284 --> 00:11:41,105
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though she says she didn't play it before.

223
00:11:41,345 --> 00:11:41,986
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't believe her.

224
00:11:42,006 --> 00:11:42,046
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

225
00:11:44,386 --> 00:11:45,187
[SPEAKER_04]: It was actually kind of fun.

226
00:11:45,507 --> 00:11:54,014
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of neat, because the game itself, if you haven't played it yet, it's going to be very similar to what Dance Central, I guess, is going to be.

227
00:11:55,295 --> 00:12:10,368
[SPEAKER_04]: It pretty much just plays like that, and all you do is you hold the remote, and you just kind of mimic what's on the screen, and it will just kind of... It'll only detect what you're doing with the remote, but it's still pretty close, and it's fun, and it's got some decent songs in there, so...

228
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:14,930
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you jam to TikTok?

229
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:17,251
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you get your Kesha on?

230
00:12:17,411 --> 00:12:18,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, we did, actually.

231
00:12:19,151 --> 00:12:20,752
[SPEAKER_03]: God, why?

232
00:12:21,112 --> 00:12:22,152
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is this not on YouTube?

233
00:12:22,172 --> 00:12:22,933
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't pick that song.

234
00:12:23,013 --> 00:12:25,693
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is there not video of Loki playing Just Dance 2?

235
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:26,914
[SPEAKER_03]: I am so upset.

236
00:12:26,934 --> 00:12:27,534
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a tragedy.

237
00:12:27,574 --> 00:12:28,914
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you mean, why isn't this on YouTube?

238
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:30,375
[SPEAKER_04]: It is on YouTube, I think.

239
00:12:30,395 --> 00:12:31,615
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my God, where?

240
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:32,596
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

241
00:12:32,756 --> 00:12:36,477
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to... My boss took... Wait, there is video of you on YouTube playing Just Dance 2.

242
00:12:36,517 --> 00:12:38,498
[SPEAKER_03]: I... Oh, my God.

243
00:12:38,578 --> 00:12:39,238
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see here.

244
00:12:40,218 --> 00:12:45,120
[SPEAKER_03]: TigerClaw, he's the best web scavenger I know.

245
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,861
[SPEAKER_03]: TigerClaw needs to find this somehow.

246
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:48,822
[SPEAKER_03]: Use your Google Foo Ninja abilities.

247
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:53,264
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if my boss has uploaded it yet because they were taking video.

248
00:12:56,905 --> 00:12:58,886
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh man, as soon as this is up, you've got to tell me.

249
00:12:59,767 --> 00:13:01,447
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I do, I guess.

250
00:13:02,408 --> 00:13:04,969
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, try not to sound too excited.

251
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:09,331
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to see if I can find...

252
00:13:12,714 --> 00:13:13,694
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, you can find it later.

253
00:13:13,854 --> 00:13:15,595
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to cause too much dead air while you search.

254
00:13:15,835 --> 00:13:16,395
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no problem.

255
00:13:16,975 --> 00:13:22,137
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, so other than Just Dance 2, I got to play around with some of the move demo stuff.

256
00:13:23,397 --> 00:13:28,118
[SPEAKER_04]: I played actually the full version of Sports Champions, which is kind of fun.

257
00:13:28,498 --> 00:13:31,999
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of like the archery that's in the game, and that was pretty cool.

258
00:13:32,439 --> 00:13:34,660
[SPEAKER_04]: It sucks, though, because at the time, though, the demo...

259
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:35,680
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

260
00:13:53,328 --> 00:13:54,349
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

261
00:14:11,729 --> 00:14:13,090
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm horrible at frisbee golf.

262
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:15,190
[SPEAKER_04]: I tried a little bit of the table tennis.

263
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:17,131
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care for the table tennis too much.

264
00:14:17,991 --> 00:14:24,233
[SPEAKER_03]: How did archery in the PlayStation Move sports game compare to archery in Wii Sport Resort or whatever it was?

265
00:14:24,253 --> 00:14:29,674
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't played Wii Sports Resort yet, but I think it would be way more accurate than it is.

266
00:14:30,134 --> 00:14:32,395
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's just...

267
00:14:33,482 --> 00:14:35,744
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, it just felt right, I guess.

268
00:14:35,904 --> 00:14:40,348
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't played it with two of the controllers yet.

269
00:14:40,448 --> 00:14:41,589
[SPEAKER_04]: I do have my own kit now.

270
00:14:41,969 --> 00:14:49,035
[SPEAKER_04]: I have two of the Move controllers, which Rob was sticking on his chest earlier, and I'm sure there's pictures online.

271
00:14:49,235 --> 00:14:52,058
[SPEAKER_04]: I would not say that those pictures exist on Twitter.

272
00:14:53,737 --> 00:14:55,498
[SPEAKER_04]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

273
00:15:19,694 --> 00:15:23,320
[SPEAKER_04]: so that it can't be played for a week, thus frustrating people.

274
00:15:24,441 --> 00:15:34,475
[SPEAKER_04]: So actually, I went to GameStop and Best Buy today, and no one had any of the stuff that's already out for the move, which is disappointing because I have just the demos to play right now, which is fine.

275
00:15:34,535 --> 00:15:35,116
[SPEAKER_04]: They're still fun.

276
00:15:35,897 --> 00:15:40,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, another demo I checked out was Eyepet, and I gotta say, Eyepet is retarded.

277
00:15:41,222 --> 00:15:42,944
[SPEAKER_04]: And it really does not work.

278
00:15:44,225 --> 00:15:52,273
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems like a neat idea at first, but, you mean, to actually get it so that it looks right, you have to get the camera at, like, the perfect angle.

279
00:15:53,094 --> 00:15:56,077
[SPEAKER_04]: And really, it just works like a really crappy, um...

280
00:15:58,115 --> 00:16:01,638
[SPEAKER_04]: iToy game, you know, like way back in the PlayStation 2 and stuff.

281
00:16:01,778 --> 00:16:04,401
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just, it's not good at all.

282
00:16:04,621 --> 00:16:08,805
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't lend well to the argument that this is just the iToy all over again, right?

283
00:16:09,225 --> 00:16:09,786
[SPEAKER_04]: It does not.

284
00:16:10,509 --> 00:16:13,151
[SPEAKER_04]: Thankfully, though, that's the only game that that's the case with.

285
00:16:16,294 --> 00:16:18,456
[SPEAKER_04]: They have you do a few different things.

286
00:16:18,696 --> 00:16:23,261
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, they have you play with him.

287
00:16:23,421 --> 00:16:27,284
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess you move your fingers or whatever, and he's supposed to roll over and stuff.

288
00:16:27,925 --> 00:16:29,787
[SPEAKER_04]: And it just did not detect that.

289
00:16:29,807 --> 00:16:32,129
[SPEAKER_04]: It just was having trouble figuring out what I was trying to do.

290
00:16:32,709 --> 00:16:49,217
[SPEAKER_04]: and then it had me draw an airplane and he'd fly around in it and I don't know what the problem was with this but for some reason I mean I'm pretty good at tracing outlines and stuff you know like on the Wii and the DS and that kind of thing

291
00:16:49,697 --> 00:16:56,340
[SPEAKER_04]: But when I tried to trace the outline for the plane using the PlayStation Move Controller, it looked like crap.

292
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:59,021
[SPEAKER_04]: It just was not working too well.

293
00:16:59,121 --> 00:17:00,422
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, hey, whatever.

294
00:17:00,762 --> 00:17:02,103
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a crappy game to begin with.

295
00:17:02,383 --> 00:17:05,124
[SPEAKER_04]: And then also they have you trying to wash him.

296
00:17:05,764 --> 00:17:07,105
[SPEAKER_04]: And the problem is I couldn't tell.

297
00:17:07,765 --> 00:17:13,448
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I had trouble figuring out whether my Move Controller was in front or behind him and stuff like that.

298
00:17:13,568 --> 00:17:16,289
[SPEAKER_04]: So I had to kind of try to figure out where to turn it in perspective.

299
00:17:16,349 --> 00:17:17,350
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just very awkward.

300
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:19,111
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I don't recommend that game.

301
00:17:19,151 --> 00:17:22,473
[SPEAKER_04]: But, I mean, most people figure out it's a waste of time anyways.

302
00:17:23,753 --> 00:17:25,154
[SPEAKER_04]: Then, what else did I try?

303
00:17:25,815 --> 00:17:26,995
[SPEAKER_04]: I tried the Tiger Woods demo.

304
00:17:27,516 --> 00:17:28,156
[SPEAKER_04]: That worked alright.

305
00:17:28,696 --> 00:17:30,878
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just very difficult to get it set up so that...

306
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:35,948
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can use the move controller.

307
00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:38,509
[SPEAKER_04]: At least I found that it was kind of difficult to get it set up.

308
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:49,075
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and calibrating it's actually pretty easy as far as... Because I was reading some reviews for different things and they were saying that they had to constantly calibrate the controller.

309
00:17:49,536 --> 00:17:50,877
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't find that to be the case actually.

310
00:17:50,897 --> 00:17:53,318
[SPEAKER_04]: With Sports Champions, you calibrate it once and you're good to go.

311
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:55,679
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was kind of cool.

312
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:59,342
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm trying to think what else I played that was kind of fun.

313
00:18:00,222 --> 00:18:00,882
[SPEAKER_04]: I tried the...

314
00:18:04,238 --> 00:18:12,482
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like some kung fu game where you actually roll down the street on office chairs and that was crap.

315
00:18:13,243 --> 00:18:14,263
[SPEAKER_04]: It did not control well.

316
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:15,824
[SPEAKER_04]: But Sports Champions is fun.

317
00:18:17,091 --> 00:18:21,815
[SPEAKER_08]: Wasn't there a minigame in Incredible Crisis where you go down the street in a chair?

318
00:18:21,895 --> 00:18:24,397
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's on a gurney.

319
00:18:24,617 --> 00:18:26,218
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it's on the hospital bed, yeah.

320
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:27,239
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

321
00:18:27,259 --> 00:18:36,147
[SPEAKER_03]: Looking at our chatroom, chat.orangeonstrater.com, Blackwolf is in our chat, the good pal of ours that does the show before us, live at All Games Radio when we tape live on Sunday nights.

322
00:18:36,387 --> 00:18:37,368
[SPEAKER_03]: He says, Oh, cool.

323
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:40,111
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't realize that Move was coming out on Friday and not Sunday.

324
00:18:40,171 --> 00:18:41,492
[SPEAKER_03]: Originally, it was coming out on Sunday.

325
00:18:41,512 --> 00:18:41,612
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

326
00:18:41,812 --> 00:18:42,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they kept moving it around.

327
00:18:42,873 --> 00:18:46,297
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, the Sony reps had trouble remembering what day it was supposed to be coming out on.

328
00:18:46,377 --> 00:18:48,459
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, it's Friday now, not Sunday.

329
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:53,124
[SPEAKER_04]: Although there are some games coming out on Sunday, but you don't really need to mess with those.

330
00:18:53,184 --> 00:18:54,606
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just the Brunswick bowling game.

331
00:18:56,108 --> 00:18:57,189
[SPEAKER_03]: So would you be paying money for this?

332
00:18:58,089 --> 00:19:18,236
[SPEAKER_04]: would i be paying money for it if you didn't already have it in your hot little hands would you pay money for it um i might but the problem is like i don't know how much i'm gonna play with this but it's it's pretty fun um you know it's definitely if if you like the wii stuff you're gonna probably like this but it is a lot more sensitive i think so they kind of took what they did on the wii and

333
00:19:18,894 --> 00:19:20,294
[SPEAKER_04]: Improved upon it, which is good.

334
00:19:20,675 --> 00:19:26,116
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, as long as they come out with good games for it, then I don't think it's a bad investment at all.

335
00:19:27,397 --> 00:19:27,737
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

336
00:19:27,897 --> 00:19:34,879
[SPEAKER_04]: And the best part about it, this is like, you know, a lot of the stuff you probably don't need to get the navigation controller for because most of the games don't use it.

337
00:19:35,479 --> 00:19:35,879
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wow.

338
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:41,361
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, really, you're only going to use the navigation controller if you're playing like SOCOM or Killzone 3, I think.

339
00:19:41,641 --> 00:19:55,818
[SPEAKER_03]: I gotta admit, I'm not sure it's the greatest idea that they do this whole separate skews for like a, you know, camera, a camera and one controller, a controller and the navigation.

340
00:19:56,098 --> 00:20:00,503
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it kind of seems like it's too complicated to figure out what you need and with all these different...

341
00:20:01,424 --> 00:20:06,167
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that they did that, though, because I own a camera.

342
00:20:06,487 --> 00:20:09,688
[SPEAKER_04]: So, like, now that I've got the kit, I've got two cameras.

343
00:20:09,849 --> 00:20:16,952
[SPEAKER_03]: But the whole optional navigation controller, which I guess is true on the Wii to an extent, but every Wii comes with one, at least.

344
00:20:17,092 --> 00:20:19,333
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, the designers know they can do at least one.

345
00:20:19,353 --> 00:20:25,857
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, technically, it still comes with one because it comes with a regular DualShock controller, which can double as a navigation controller if you want it to.

346
00:20:26,137 --> 00:20:26,217
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.

347
00:20:27,278 --> 00:20:53,458
[SPEAKER_04]: so if you really I mean it's kind of awkward to hold it because you have to hold it with one hand but I mean if you don't really care then you can use that as a navigation controller if for example you're playing Killzone 3 or something like that and you want to try out the move controls and you have a move controller but you don't have the navigation controller you can get by with that but you may want to get an actual navigation controller later on

348
00:20:53,932 --> 00:21:04,178
[SPEAKER_03]: Looking at our chat room live on this Sunday night at chat.orangeloungeradio.com, Tiger Claw is saying, speaking of move, Sony launched an anti-connect site about the buttons called yaybuttons.com.

349
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:07,720
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd heard about this, but it wasn't on our list for tonight.

350
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,900
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you looked at this site at all?

351
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:14,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, that's great that they have a campaign about yay buttons and stuff like that.

352
00:21:15,445 --> 00:21:17,386
[SPEAKER_03]: I do love that website name, I gotta say.

353
00:21:17,807 --> 00:21:19,788
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay buttons is a good name for a site.

354
00:21:19,868 --> 00:21:21,930
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a stupid argument to make right now.

355
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:31,477
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, because even Microsoft came out and said, well, we never said that we can't have a game that uses both the Kinect camera and a controller.

356
00:21:32,377 --> 00:21:36,180
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, hooray with your campaign and everything.

357
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:50,310
[SPEAKER_04]: and really all these games that they have out there right now just use either the trigger or the top move button or basically the A and B button on a Wii Remote because a lot of these games play just like Wii games.

358
00:21:50,931 --> 00:21:52,372
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's... What a shock.

359
00:21:52,832 --> 00:21:55,194
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, what a shock that they play like Wii games.

360
00:21:56,875 --> 00:21:57,215
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

361
00:21:59,176 --> 00:21:59,817
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of fun.

362
00:22:01,932 --> 00:22:08,296
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, if you're looking for something that's going to be way better than the Wii, you're probably not going to find it with this.

363
00:22:09,117 --> 00:22:09,517
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

364
00:22:09,697 --> 00:22:14,400
[SPEAKER_03]: So what games do we have to look forward to on the move that you're going to be checking out for us?

365
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:20,544
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the, you know, Sports Champions.

366
00:22:21,125 --> 00:22:21,905
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty good.

367
00:22:24,087 --> 00:22:28,790
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually haven't played it yet, but there's that Time Crisis Raising Storm.

368
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:30,091
[SPEAKER_04]: That looked kind of fun.

369
00:22:30,831 --> 00:22:33,812
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the Toy Story 3 game, but if it's too much money, I wouldn't bother.

370
00:22:34,753 --> 00:22:35,313
[SPEAKER_03]: It was cute, though.

371
00:22:35,533 --> 00:22:38,214
[SPEAKER_03]: You reminded me of Midway Mania, which is what I liked.

372
00:22:38,734 --> 00:22:44,516
[SPEAKER_04]: I might check out... I'm trying to think what else I would probably pick up for that.

373
00:22:45,837 --> 00:22:46,197
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

374
00:22:46,497 --> 00:22:51,559
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hard to say right now, because I'm not going to pick up SOCOM.

375
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:53,200
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

376
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:55,140
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe some of the PlayStation Network games.

377
00:22:55,881 --> 00:22:58,802
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll just see whatever they throw my way, because I don't want to spend a lot of money.

378
00:23:00,347 --> 00:23:00,707
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

379
00:23:01,268 --> 00:23:02,869
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let's talk about MyGamingWeek.

380
00:23:02,949 --> 00:23:06,772
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, before we get to MyGamingWeek, though, I want to make a special phone call here a little bit.

381
00:23:06,892 --> 00:23:10,135
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to actually call... He was here last week on the show.

382
00:23:10,195 --> 00:23:11,937
[SPEAKER_03]: He's Alan, a.k.a.

383
00:23:11,977 --> 00:23:13,618
[SPEAKER_03]: SalaciousPop, a.k.a.

384
00:23:13,678 --> 00:23:19,223
[SPEAKER_03]: my boyfriend, is sitting there at his computer, and he knows we're calling him because I want to talk about something here tonight.

385
00:23:19,683 --> 00:23:20,343
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Alan, are you there?

386
00:23:21,865 --> 00:23:23,566
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, hi, coming to us via Skype.

387
00:23:23,906 --> 00:23:28,969
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Alan, you live in the Bay Area in California, right?

388
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:30,130
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

389
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:34,892
[SPEAKER_03]: And you don't live that far away from where there was actually a really bad tragedy this week, right?

390
00:23:36,253 --> 00:23:36,493
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.

391
00:23:36,633 --> 00:23:38,014
[SPEAKER_11]: Tell us a little bit about what happened.

392
00:23:38,394 --> 00:23:44,377
[SPEAKER_11]: Thursday evening at about 6.15, a giant gas main several feet across blew up.

393
00:23:45,187 --> 00:23:48,188
[SPEAKER_11]: underneath some houses and kind of destroyed an entire neighborhood.

394
00:23:49,228 --> 00:23:49,869
[SPEAKER_03]: Very sad.

395
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:54,030
[SPEAKER_03]: And somebody's going to be in a lot of trouble when they sort through all that mess.

396
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:55,830
[SPEAKER_03]: But very, very sad tragedy.

397
00:23:56,171 --> 00:23:57,831
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, was it scary?

398
00:23:57,871 --> 00:23:58,991
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you have to evacuate?

399
00:23:59,031 --> 00:24:00,072
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you have to get out of the house?

400
00:24:00,172 --> 00:24:00,712
[SPEAKER_03]: What happened?

401
00:24:01,972 --> 00:24:03,653
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it happened.

402
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:07,394
[SPEAKER_11]: The neighborhood affected is maybe two miles

403
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:08,844
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

404
00:24:29,173 --> 00:24:31,555
[SPEAKER_11]: This block that I'm on was totally unaffected.

405
00:24:31,695 --> 00:24:34,537
[SPEAKER_11]: All of the wind blew all the smoke and everything south.

406
00:24:55,410 --> 00:25:00,472
[SPEAKER_03]: Boom noise and things actually shook for a minute and my car had ash on it.

407
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:01,592
[SPEAKER_03]: It was crazy.

408
00:25:01,912 --> 00:25:02,832
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really sad.

409
00:25:03,193 --> 00:25:06,754
[SPEAKER_03]: But you didn't hear a giant boom?

410
00:25:06,814 --> 00:25:07,954
[SPEAKER_03]: You didn't feel the shake?

411
00:25:08,074 --> 00:25:09,535
[SPEAKER_03]: Or was it just, oh, another earthquake?

412
00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:10,475
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't get it.

413
00:25:10,615 --> 00:25:12,376
[SPEAKER_03]: What happened?

414
00:25:12,516 --> 00:25:19,098
[SPEAKER_11]: Only being two miles away and the explosion being as large as it was did actually shake the building that I'm in.

415
00:25:19,738 --> 00:25:22,519
[SPEAKER_11]: Apparently it rattled windows for miles in every direction.

416
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:28,442
[SPEAKER_11]: I was completely oblivious though because at the time I was raiding in WoW.

417
00:25:32,424 --> 00:25:35,645
[SPEAKER_11]: Which is really the punchline that you were trying desperately to get me to.

418
00:25:35,905 --> 00:25:45,849
[SPEAKER_11]: So yes, I was raiding in WoW while 53 homes were completely razed and my housemate had to tell me to look out the window to see all the black smoke.

419
00:25:46,590 --> 00:26:01,543
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, there's the punchline I was looking for and why I brought you on to tell this horrible tragedy story on the Video Game Radio show is that you missed total chaos and tragedy going on mere miles away because you were trying to get Festergat down.

420
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:03,245
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

421
00:26:04,406 --> 00:26:05,727
[SPEAKER_11]: Everyone's judging me right now.

422
00:26:05,887 --> 00:26:06,868
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you get any loot?

423
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:11,011
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I got no good drops.

424
00:26:11,552 --> 00:26:11,672
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh.

425
00:26:12,926 --> 00:26:16,628
[SPEAKER_03]: What must have been your reaction, though, when you opened up the window and just saw all the smoke?

426
00:26:16,668 --> 00:26:19,089
[SPEAKER_03]: Were you just like, oh, damn.

427
00:26:20,289 --> 00:26:22,830
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, yeah, I was like, that's not good.

428
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:27,312
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I went to KCBS and SFGate and I started looking at the feeds.

429
00:26:27,913 --> 00:26:33,335
[SPEAKER_11]: Because there was a huge boom that set off the gas explosion and people...

430
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:35,000
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

431
00:26:59,744 --> 00:27:03,810
[SPEAKER_11]: The fire burned for a couple hours because they couldn't turn the gas main off.

432
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:04,992
[SPEAKER_11]: That was like a big blowtorch.

433
00:27:05,072 --> 00:27:06,094
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my gosh, so sad.

434
00:27:08,097 --> 00:27:14,000
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't even imagine just being at home watching Oprah or being like DarkSakura sitting around naked playing Star Trek online.

435
00:27:15,441 --> 00:27:21,444
[SPEAKER_03]: And then suddenly, kaboom, oops, PG&E didn't notice the crack in the pipe.

436
00:27:21,604 --> 00:27:21,905
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh-oh.

437
00:27:22,245 --> 00:27:23,625
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what's actually kind of sad, though?

438
00:27:23,946 --> 00:27:26,787
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, I seriously don't mean to make light of a tragedy.

439
00:27:26,847 --> 00:27:33,071
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just kind of interesting that sometimes we get so in the zone of gaming that we miss these things.

440
00:27:33,351 --> 00:27:33,931
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

441
00:28:03,471 --> 00:28:04,412
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, fire department.

442
00:28:30,226 --> 00:28:37,713
[SPEAKER_11]: When I was in grade school and living in Martinez, Martinez has a huge, ugly shell oil refinery behind it.

443
00:28:37,793 --> 00:28:42,737
[SPEAKER_11]: For anyone that's ever been in Martinez, it looks very Blade Runner.

444
00:28:42,797 --> 00:28:44,199
[SPEAKER_11]: It's very gross and huge.

445
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:45,580
[SPEAKER_11]: And that had an explosion.

446
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:46,581
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, no.

447
00:28:47,682 --> 00:28:51,385
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think like two or three workers, unfortunately, died at the time.

448
00:28:51,505 --> 00:28:52,266
[SPEAKER_11]: I was like 10 or 11 years old.

449
00:28:53,979 --> 00:28:55,320
[SPEAKER_11]: Starfire, Starfire, Starfire, I don't know.

450
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:31,408
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well, look, if you want to make a donation to the victims of San Bruno, which, you know, again, we don't mean to make fun of it.

451
00:29:31,428 --> 00:29:35,653
[SPEAKER_03]: We're making fun of Alan and the fact that he missed it and not making fun of what happened because it really is a tragedy.

452
00:29:35,993 --> 00:29:41,700
[SPEAKER_03]: We do definitely want you to consider maybe making a donation to the Red Cross to help the victims of the San Bruno fire.

453
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:42,621
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

454
00:30:05,281 --> 00:30:34,488
[SPEAKER_03]: and for those OLR listeners living in the Bay Area that have donated blood that don't have ridiculous restrictions against them that prevents them from donating blood which archaic archaic things that need to be changed but you know unfortunately we don't want to hold those silly restrictions against the victims you know so we'll donate cash I guess yeah but definitely well thanks for calling hey no problem thanks for being on the show thank you for letting me make fun of you see this is why you rock yeah you rock goodnight night hon alright

455
00:30:36,124 --> 00:30:36,864
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

456
00:30:58,716 --> 00:31:00,598
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't do anything.

457
00:31:01,439 --> 00:31:10,346
[SPEAKER_03]: And these are like two half-assed things that Apple has launched lately between Ping, which is like, I think it's like Twitter, but it's not because all it really shows is the music.

458
00:31:11,047 --> 00:31:17,153
[SPEAKER_03]: Game Room, you just have a friends list and you can see what games they own and what achievements they have.

459
00:31:17,293 --> 00:31:21,596
[SPEAKER_03]: But I have yet to see how that whole multiplayer integration works or anything like that.

460
00:31:21,697 --> 00:31:23,038
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't get it.

461
00:31:23,658 --> 00:31:24,819
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't tried any of those.

462
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:25,440
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

463
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:50,829
[SPEAKER_03]: But because I'm a sucker and because I had credit still from gift cards I got for like my birthday a few months ago I downloaded one of the Game Center compatible games It's a game called Grawl Classic Plus And I was drawn to check out this game because the artwork kind of makes it look like this little like Legend of Zelda-y, chibi type of game And it said it was an MMO So I was like, oh, that's kind of a neat idea Like an MMO on the iPhone that kind of looks like a Super Nintendo game, right?

464
00:31:51,249 --> 00:31:51,549
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome

465
00:31:52,525 --> 00:31:55,586
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, it's the worst thing I've ever played in my life.

466
00:31:55,766 --> 00:31:57,646
[SPEAKER_03]: It is so stupid.

467
00:31:57,806 --> 00:31:59,347
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you spend money on that?

468
00:31:59,607 --> 00:32:01,867
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I spent someone else's money because it was gift cards.

469
00:32:01,907 --> 00:32:03,728
[SPEAKER_03]: I spent $1.99 on that.

470
00:32:04,208 --> 00:32:07,188
[SPEAKER_03]: And it is so stupid.

471
00:32:07,449 --> 00:32:14,170
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the equivalent of one of those MMOs that you would see the cards for at the grocery store that you just kind of laugh at.

472
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:15,690
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I'm never going to buy those, right?

473
00:32:16,371 --> 00:32:17,571
[SPEAKER_03]: It's worse than Farmville.

474
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:19,772
[SPEAKER_06]: Farmville's pretty awful.

475
00:32:19,872 --> 00:32:20,872
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't understand.

476
00:32:21,052 --> 00:32:22,293
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even understand the point.

477
00:32:22,553 --> 00:32:23,834
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no quest.

478
00:32:23,934 --> 00:32:25,995
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no leveling.

479
00:32:26,075 --> 00:32:32,098
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just make a character and run around stabbing bushes hoping you find little green gems in them.

480
00:32:32,498 --> 00:32:36,200
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's guilds, but the chat is all screwed up.

481
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:39,322
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just overcome with idiocy.

482
00:32:40,422 --> 00:32:46,045
[SPEAKER_03]: People yelling weird things in the road and trying to trick people into giving honor points and just...

483
00:32:46,505 --> 00:32:47,546
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't get it.

484
00:32:47,626 --> 00:32:49,508
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would anyone waste their time with this garbage?

485
00:32:49,528 --> 00:32:51,049
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I did, I guess.

486
00:32:51,089 --> 00:32:53,571
[SPEAKER_03]: Boy, did I pick a stinker to test out Game Center with.

487
00:32:54,012 --> 00:32:59,376
[SPEAKER_03]: So now I've decided Game Center is completely stupid and a waste of time based on this one game that I played.

488
00:33:00,837 --> 00:33:01,418
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.

489
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:05,202
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be the one new game that I checked out this week.

490
00:33:05,242 --> 00:33:06,803
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, that's Grawl Classic Plus.

491
00:33:06,823 --> 00:33:14,969
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, if you want to burn $2 and look at how terrible this game is, it's one of those, I'm almost thinking it's so bad, you have to see it.

492
00:33:15,009 --> 00:33:18,271
[SPEAKER_03]: If anybody can figure out the point of this game, I would love to hear from you.

493
00:33:18,571 --> 00:33:23,955
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love to hear from the developers of this game of what it is they were trying to do with this game, because I don't get it.

494
00:33:24,675 --> 00:33:26,536
[SPEAKER_08]: Pull you into paying for it.

495
00:33:28,177 --> 00:33:28,477
[SPEAKER_03]: Help.

496
00:33:30,099 --> 00:33:30,579
[SPEAKER_03]: So there you go.

497
00:33:31,226 --> 00:33:32,247
[SPEAKER_03]: GameCenter, fail.

498
00:33:32,407 --> 00:33:33,248
[SPEAKER_03]: Ping, fail.

499
00:33:34,449 --> 00:33:36,752
[SPEAKER_03]: Grawl, whatever, plus plus, mega fail.

500
00:33:38,354 --> 00:33:40,156
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise it's just been more Warcraft.

501
00:33:40,216 --> 00:33:43,759
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I did play Dead Rising Case Zero myself and it was fun.

502
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:47,644
[SPEAKER_03]: But I got eaten by a lot of zombies because I'm not very good at Dead Rising.

503
00:33:48,525 --> 00:33:49,726
[SPEAKER_08]: Did the military kill you?

504
00:33:50,453 --> 00:33:52,235
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you find all the bike parts?

505
00:33:52,295 --> 00:33:54,837
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I was trying to get to the van with the Zombrex and I got chewed up.

506
00:33:54,877 --> 00:33:55,897
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't get very far at all.

507
00:33:57,158 --> 00:33:59,821
[SPEAKER_03]: But I liked that there were so many cutscenes and everything in an arcade game.

508
00:33:59,841 --> 00:34:00,641
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought that was kind of cool.

509
00:34:00,801 --> 00:34:01,582
[SPEAKER_08]: That was pretty neat.

510
00:34:02,363 --> 00:34:03,203
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought it was fun.

511
00:34:04,004 --> 00:34:04,544
[SPEAKER_08]: Pitchfork.

512
00:34:05,205 --> 00:34:05,565
[SPEAKER_08]: Rifle.

513
00:34:06,266 --> 00:34:06,566
[SPEAKER_08]: Win.

514
00:34:06,726 --> 00:34:09,789
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll take a look.

515
00:34:09,929 --> 00:34:10,349
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

516
00:34:10,649 --> 00:34:12,371
[SPEAKER_08]: It just occurred to me what a cool weapon would be.

517
00:34:13,291 --> 00:34:17,034
[SPEAKER_08]: Take like three broadswords and a pogo stick and you'd have pogo stab.

518
00:34:17,995 --> 00:34:18,656
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be awesome.

519
00:34:19,463 --> 00:34:30,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Going to our chat room at chat.orangeonstrater.com Marissa Congusto We love Marissa I love her Marissa, I love you Alright I'm gonna poop on Ping She's pooping Get it?

520
00:34:31,215 --> 00:34:42,447
[SPEAKER_03]: She's She's going to poop on Ping Pooping Because it censors tweets from artists Such as Gaga's pro-gay marriage tweets Eye roll It's useless anyway I didn't even know they did that

521
00:34:43,869 --> 00:34:44,049
[SPEAKER_03]: PooPing

522
00:35:09,969 --> 00:35:17,873
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember when Ping was just on the other IRC screen where it just went ping, ping, ping.

523
00:35:18,153 --> 00:35:23,295
[SPEAKER_03]: There was also an app for the iPhone for a limited time called Ping and it was like free SMS basically to put it lightly.

524
00:35:23,615 --> 00:35:26,837
[SPEAKER_03]: They changed their name a few months ago to Ping Chat and they never said why.

525
00:35:26,957 --> 00:35:27,417
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I know.

526
00:35:27,877 --> 00:35:31,359
[SPEAKER_03]: Because Apple probably said you better change your name or we're going to pooping on you.

527
00:35:32,039 --> 00:35:32,579
[SPEAKER_03]: So there you go.

528
00:35:32,599 --> 00:35:35,741
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe we can release an app called Pooping.

529
00:35:37,935 --> 00:35:38,395
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

530
00:35:38,435 --> 00:35:43,496
[SPEAKER_08]: We should get someone who can program like that and do an app, you know, to make fun of it called Pooping.

531
00:35:43,636 --> 00:35:44,597
[SPEAKER_03]: Or Cropping.

532
00:35:44,657 --> 00:35:46,957
[SPEAKER_03]: It probably would not get approved by the App Store.

533
00:35:46,997 --> 00:35:48,177
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe you could put it on Android.

534
00:35:48,757 --> 00:35:50,098
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a social network called Pooping.

535
00:35:51,138 --> 00:35:54,559
[SPEAKER_03]: And it could be all about, like, you know, because that's what Twitter's for.

536
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:56,499
[SPEAKER_03]: Essentially all for talking shit about people.

537
00:35:57,539 --> 00:35:59,760
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, no, you know how you make tweets when you go to the bathroom.

538
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:01,120
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm pooping right now!

539
00:36:29,132 --> 00:36:32,193
[SPEAKER_03]: Burger King Bathroom, well cleaned, smells like bleach.

540
00:36:36,975 --> 00:36:42,297
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, chat.orangeloungeradio.com if you'd like to join and join in the madness.

541
00:36:44,078 --> 00:36:47,219
[SPEAKER_06]: Marissa said that Steve Jobs said himself, no more fart apps.

542
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:47,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

543
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:48,720
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

544
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:50,861
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good thing, I think.

545
00:36:51,081 --> 00:36:52,322
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't need any more fart apps.

546
00:36:53,162 --> 00:36:58,344
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, LightAmiga777 in chat says, OLRPoop, where there's smoke, they ping back.

547
00:36:59,909 --> 00:37:00,549
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I get that.

548
00:37:00,669 --> 00:37:00,910
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

549
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:04,412
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go ahead and actually get into some gaming news tonight.

550
00:37:04,532 --> 00:37:05,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's quick housekeeping.

551
00:37:05,872 --> 00:37:07,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Add us on Facebook.

552
00:37:07,533 --> 00:37:09,114
[SPEAKER_03]: Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio.

553
00:37:09,134 --> 00:37:09,895
[SPEAKER_03]: We also have a Twitter.

554
00:37:09,935 --> 00:37:11,556
[SPEAKER_03]: Twitter.com slash OLR.

555
00:37:12,136 --> 00:37:13,537
[SPEAKER_03]: And you should add us on those sites.

556
00:37:14,497 --> 00:37:15,398
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah.

557
00:37:15,538 --> 00:37:18,500
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, I don't think there's a whole lot of news going on here.

558
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,061
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to be out the first week of October.

559
00:37:21,421 --> 00:37:23,503
[SPEAKER_03]: October 2nd, 3rd, somewhere in there.

560
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:24,923
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to be gone that week.

561
00:37:24,983 --> 00:37:25,864
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know if there'll be a show.

562
00:37:26,224 --> 00:37:27,045
[SPEAKER_08]: Bring me pins.

563
00:37:27,065 --> 00:37:27,766
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there can be.

564
00:37:28,186 --> 00:37:29,728
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm going to Gay Days at Disneyland.

565
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:30,489
[SPEAKER_08]: Bring me pins.

566
00:37:30,669 --> 00:37:30,849
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

567
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:31,930
[SPEAKER_08]: Lots of them.

568
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:33,592
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm taking Alan for the first time since he was 18.

569
00:37:33,632 --> 00:37:34,993
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

570
00:37:35,654 --> 00:37:37,256
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't worry, we're going back for Tron, remember?

571
00:37:37,456 --> 00:37:39,718
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, we are, but you still must bring me pins.

572
00:37:39,859 --> 00:37:40,119
[SPEAKER_08]: I will.

573
00:37:40,639 --> 00:37:41,821
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they'll have a Tron pin.

574
00:37:42,241 --> 00:37:43,723
[SPEAKER_08]: If you find Tron pins, you better.

575
00:37:43,923 --> 00:37:44,163
[SPEAKER_08]: I will.

576
00:37:44,563 --> 00:37:46,606
[SPEAKER_08]: I will give you monies for pins for Tron.

577
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:52,291
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's get into some actual bonafide gaming news.

578
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:55,293
[SPEAKER_03]: We're only like 40 minutes in this show and haven't talked a lot about gaming news.

579
00:37:55,513 --> 00:37:57,734
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, what's up in the world of gaming?

580
00:37:58,174 --> 00:38:04,277
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, lots of stuff, especially when it comes to PS3 and firmware and all that fun stuff.

581
00:38:04,617 --> 00:38:07,858
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, starting things off, you knew what was going to happen.

582
00:38:07,878 --> 00:38:12,300
[SPEAKER_04]: The PlayStation 3 got a mandatory firmware bringing it up to 3.42.

583
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:19,442
[SPEAKER_04]: This firmware update does nothing other than break the PS jailbreak and the PS Groove hacks.

584
00:38:20,282 --> 00:38:28,585
[SPEAKER_04]: And since this was an overall security-related issue, it says we will provide no further commentary to this case.

585
00:38:29,545 --> 00:38:34,887
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's a wonderful thing to say, fucking dick of a Sony rep.

586
00:38:36,227 --> 00:38:41,609
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, to be fair, they don't... Well, why didn't they just say, you know... They don't really... We're not providing any commentary in this case.

587
00:38:41,709 --> 00:38:42,049
[SPEAKER_04]: Nah.

588
00:38:42,289 --> 00:38:45,330
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't... They can just say, we don't like people hacking our consoles, so we patched it.

589
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:46,390
[SPEAKER_03]: Devil's advocate.

590
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:48,691
[SPEAKER_03]: A, they don't owe you shit for an explanation.

591
00:38:48,851 --> 00:38:54,493
[SPEAKER_03]: B, maybe they plan to litigate against these people so they don't want to say anything publicly because there's going to be litigation in the future.

592
00:38:55,026 --> 00:39:01,256
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if they can because, I don't know, because the... Oh, come on, this is America, they can sue anyone.

593
00:39:02,418 --> 00:39:03,339
[SPEAKER_04]: They can try, I guess.

594
00:39:05,462 --> 00:39:07,005
[SPEAKER_04]: Trying's important for them.

595
00:39:08,465 --> 00:39:11,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay buttons, I don't know.

596
00:39:13,068 --> 00:39:20,593
[SPEAKER_03]: YayLawSuit.com No new features though in this latest firmware, right?

597
00:39:20,613 --> 00:39:22,714
[SPEAKER_03]: The only feature is disabling this hack.

598
00:39:22,734 --> 00:39:29,178
[SPEAKER_04]: If you are interested still in running homebrew stuff, and we will get to why the homebrew is not all bad.

599
00:39:29,418 --> 00:39:32,660
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember, it's just that backup device, that's a bad thing.

600
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:33,661
[SPEAKER_04]: Homebrew, not so bad.

601
00:39:34,301 --> 00:39:37,863
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, Sony just seized the backup device, and that's all they care about.

602
00:39:38,303 --> 00:39:43,665
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, they patched it out, so if you don't want to update to 3.41, stay off the PlayStation Network.

603
00:39:44,926 --> 00:39:58,052
[SPEAKER_04]: It's interesting, though, because one of the things that actually did come around because of this is a way to enable any PlayStation 3 game to be played as a remote play game on your PSP.

604
00:39:58,633 --> 00:39:58,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Why...

605
00:39:59,913 --> 00:40:12,637
[SPEAKER_04]: They aren't like that in the first place is beyond me, but apparently it's a really simple edit to one of the files that's on there that you basically, you can actually run this program called a PS3 SFO editor.

606
00:40:14,057 --> 00:40:25,200
[SPEAKER_04]: Once you have your game dumped to the hard drive and you just click a button that says PSP remote play available and then click it and it will allow you to play it over your PSP.

607
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,861
[SPEAKER_04]: including, you know, games that don't allow it.

608
00:40:27,921 --> 00:40:29,202
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, for example, Infamous.

609
00:40:29,242 --> 00:40:30,363
[SPEAKER_04]: They actually have video of that.

610
00:40:30,543 --> 00:40:32,464
[SPEAKER_04]: So, that's kind of neat.

611
00:40:32,884 --> 00:40:35,246
[SPEAKER_04]: And a feature I don't see why they don't have.

612
00:40:35,846 --> 00:40:38,067
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe because it's buggy in some games.

613
00:40:38,207 --> 00:40:38,607
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

614
00:40:38,688 --> 00:40:42,390
[SPEAKER_04]: But if it can be done, I don't know why they don't.

615
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:45,111
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you kind of answered your own question.

616
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:47,573
[SPEAKER_03]: If it bugs in some games, that's going to be enough, I think.

617
00:40:48,393 --> 00:40:51,015
[SPEAKER_03]: It has to work consistently or they're not going to implement it, I would think.

618
00:40:52,375 --> 00:40:54,297
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I don't know about that, but...

619
00:40:55,290 --> 00:40:57,531
[SPEAKER_08]: Has it ever stopped developers from rushing out games?

620
00:40:59,752 --> 00:41:00,333
[SPEAKER_03]: Point taken.

621
00:41:03,694 --> 00:41:04,455
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, I don't know.

622
00:41:06,076 --> 00:41:08,357
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, let's see, other fun stuff.

623
00:41:09,938 --> 00:41:12,859
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, the PlayStation Freedom.

624
00:41:13,539 --> 00:41:17,642
[SPEAKER_04]: It is the port of the PlayStation, or PS Groove, I guess.

625
00:41:17,982 --> 00:41:19,382
[SPEAKER_04]: It's basically the open source...

626
00:41:21,584 --> 00:41:22,424
[SPEAKER_04]: and many more.

627
00:41:43,036 --> 00:41:51,201
[SPEAKER_04]: and basically what this does is it runs a modified program on the Android operating system.

628
00:41:51,961 --> 00:41:56,283
[SPEAKER_04]: There's all the different things to do it that way, which is kind of interesting.

629
00:41:56,663 --> 00:42:01,626
[SPEAKER_04]: They actually have it ported, funny enough, to the TI-84.

630
00:42:02,226 --> 00:42:05,708
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, those calculators can do anything.

631
00:42:06,008 --> 00:42:06,369
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.

632
00:42:06,669 --> 00:42:07,469
[SPEAKER_03]: They still make those?

633
00:42:07,829 --> 00:42:10,391
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a graphing calculator back in my day.

634
00:42:10,411 --> 00:42:10,491
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

635
00:42:10,951 --> 00:42:14,755
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, or maybe it was the 82, I don't know, but still.

636
00:42:14,895 --> 00:42:18,178
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they had the 84s back in my day, but I think they're a little bit newer now.

637
00:42:19,019 --> 00:42:21,702
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, they actually... You're officially 30 now, you're old.

638
00:42:21,942 --> 00:42:24,965
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry to interrupt, I've been told to make a small noise to show I care.

639
00:42:25,426 --> 00:42:25,706
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

640
00:42:27,768 --> 00:42:27,968
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

641
00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:30,551
[SPEAKER_08]: You can continue.

642
00:42:31,904 --> 00:42:46,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Other devices that the PS Freedom has been ported to, the HTC Droid Incredible, the HTC Wildfire, the HTC Magic 32A, the Dream G1, Magic 32B, these are all HTC Foams, the Palm Pre...

643
00:42:50,441 --> 00:42:51,122
[SPEAKER_04]: The Dingu!

644
00:42:51,642 --> 00:42:52,683
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually have a Dingu.

645
00:42:52,723 --> 00:42:55,545
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't gotten a chance to do it yet, but I may try that.

646
00:42:55,846 --> 00:43:12,240
[SPEAKER_04]: The Sony Ericsson Xperia X1, the Nokia N900 or N800 or N810, the Droid, the Droid Eris, of course, the original, oh, and the Palm Pre...

647
00:43:14,045 --> 00:43:15,827
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so basically everything.

648
00:43:17,028 --> 00:43:20,392
[SPEAKER_04]: And if it's not out for your device, it will probably be ported to it.

649
00:43:22,952 --> 00:43:49,055
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess it's not such a bad thing if you're really interested in actually putting this exploit on your console it should be readily available to do so and if it's not for stuff that you may have at home right now it will be probably soon I'm sure a piece of french toast will eventually be able to be used in hacking your PS3 just have to give it some time

650
00:43:50,410 --> 00:43:55,231
[SPEAKER_03]: I did forget to mention earlier in the show that because, you know, you're now officially 30, right, Loki?

651
00:43:55,431 --> 00:43:55,831
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I am.

652
00:43:55,891 --> 00:44:01,593
[SPEAKER_03]: So now it's officially the gaming show for 30-somethings is Orange Lounge Radio.

653
00:44:01,653 --> 00:44:02,153
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

654
00:44:02,593 --> 00:44:04,713
[SPEAKER_03]: The old crotchety video gaming show.

655
00:44:05,254 --> 00:44:08,814
[SPEAKER_03]: We actually have a new theme song for the new Orange Lounge Radio we're going to be debuting.

656
00:44:09,055 --> 00:44:09,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we?

657
00:44:09,775 --> 00:44:12,055
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we should have done it tonight, but we'll do it next week.

658
00:44:12,615 --> 00:44:14,636
[SPEAKER_03]: Since we're so old, here's our new theme song, you guys.

659
00:44:14,756 --> 00:44:15,076
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go.

660
00:44:18,894 --> 00:44:21,416
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, on the DSi, there's a new firmware update as well.

661
00:44:21,717 --> 00:44:21,957
[SPEAKER_03]: The 1.4.1U.

662
00:44:21,997 --> 00:44:25,180
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a new update on the DSi firmware.

663
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:26,141
[SPEAKER_03]: Guess what it does?

664
00:44:40,439 --> 00:44:43,701
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah yes, it blocks piracy and certain flashcards and all that stuff.

665
00:44:43,741 --> 00:44:44,561
[SPEAKER_03]: Which, you know, I understand.

666
00:44:44,581 --> 00:44:46,322
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a right to block piracy.

667
00:44:46,762 --> 00:44:48,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Copying games is bad.

668
00:44:48,783 --> 00:44:49,223
[SPEAKER_03]: I get that.

669
00:44:49,263 --> 00:44:51,784
[SPEAKER_03]: But these types of things also block out the homebrew.

670
00:44:52,105 --> 00:44:53,245
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is the really fun stuff.

671
00:44:53,825 --> 00:44:55,846
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, the new firmware update on the DSi.

672
00:44:55,886 --> 00:44:57,667
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the first update they've done in about a year.

673
00:44:58,127 --> 00:44:59,228
[SPEAKER_03]: No new functionality.

674
00:44:59,288 --> 00:45:03,650
[SPEAKER_03]: It just does, quote, behind-the-scenes improvements to system performance.

675
00:45:04,210 --> 00:45:09,053
[SPEAKER_03]: Which means some of the flash cartridges that allowed the Leetaxors no longer work.

676
00:45:09,893 --> 00:45:17,316
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the affected cards are the Ace Card 2i, the Super Card DS2, the M3i0, the iPlayer, and the DSTTI.

677
00:45:17,396 --> 00:45:19,257
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't even know all these things existed.

678
00:45:19,857 --> 00:45:21,898
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you know about the existence of all these cards, Loki?

679
00:45:21,918 --> 00:45:22,879
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never heard of half of these.

680
00:45:22,919 --> 00:45:23,179
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

681
00:45:23,199 --> 00:45:23,599
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

682
00:45:25,370 --> 00:45:26,291
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of them out there.

683
00:45:26,331 --> 00:45:27,892
[SPEAKER_03]: Most people just know the R4.

684
00:45:28,772 --> 00:45:31,895
[SPEAKER_03]: Some cards did manage to escape the patch.

685
00:45:32,355 --> 00:45:36,918
[SPEAKER_03]: The iSmart DS, the Easy Flash VI, and the Hyper R4.

686
00:45:37,279 --> 00:45:38,099
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, yes, the R4.

687
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:39,400
[SPEAKER_03]: So there you go.

688
00:45:39,981 --> 00:45:48,427
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of these, too, it's possible that they will have firmware updates to the actual cards themselves that may re-enable them.

689
00:45:50,228 --> 00:45:51,489
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a back-and-forth game.

690
00:45:52,188 --> 00:45:53,948
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I get it.

691
00:45:54,069 --> 00:45:59,910
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they owe it to their developers and they owe it to themselves to try and stop piracy.

692
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:04,971
[SPEAKER_03]: But it does kind of stink that there isn't at least some type of open channel for homebrew.

693
00:46:05,071 --> 00:46:14,374
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I feel like the only group whatsoever that has somewhat embraced homebrew, granted in an ultimately controlled environment, is Microsoft and the indie games.

694
00:46:14,514 --> 00:46:16,554
[SPEAKER_03]: But even then, that's really controlled.

695
00:46:16,574 --> 00:46:19,135
[SPEAKER_03]: Or even Apple with their App Store.

696
00:46:19,155 --> 00:46:19,235
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

697
00:46:19,375 --> 00:46:22,418
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, even though apps have to go through scores and scores of approvals.

698
00:46:22,438 --> 00:46:23,138
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know what?

699
00:46:23,339 --> 00:46:25,781
[SPEAKER_03]: There's fart apps galore and all this stupid shit.

700
00:46:25,801 --> 00:46:26,982
[SPEAKER_03]: But see, that's the thing, though.

701
00:46:27,002 --> 00:46:32,607
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you imagine if these people were able to program apps for, like, say, the Nintendo DSi?

702
00:46:33,547 --> 00:46:35,589
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it may be a little bit more difficult, but...

703
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:38,431
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be really interesting.

704
00:46:38,511 --> 00:46:42,013
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm surprised Nintendo's DSi doesn't try to cash in on the app craze.

705
00:46:42,253 --> 00:46:43,594
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was to some extent.

706
00:46:43,874 --> 00:46:45,495
[SPEAKER_03]: They have the DSi store and so forth.

707
00:46:45,515 --> 00:46:46,936
[SPEAKER_03]: They're so behind though.

708
00:46:47,036 --> 00:46:51,259
[SPEAKER_03]: Open it up to let people make their own things.

709
00:46:51,319 --> 00:46:53,640
[SPEAKER_03]: Make them charge 99 cents for it and take half.

710
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:56,662
[SPEAKER_04]: How long did it take them to finally come out with WiiWare?

711
00:46:56,742 --> 00:46:58,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously.

712
00:46:58,343 --> 00:46:59,564
[SPEAKER_04]: They're so behind.

713
00:47:01,084 --> 00:47:01,865
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not surprised.

714
00:47:05,351 --> 00:47:31,319
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm bummed for the homebrew it's a little harder to feel sympathy for pirates the jig is up kids but for homebrew you're kind of like oh bummer there's also another update to the Wii system firmware as well it's actually still marked as the current firmware but it will remove all the homebrew that you have installed on your system but does the exploit still work or did they patch that too?

715
00:47:32,452 --> 00:47:32,852
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura

716
00:47:55,489 --> 00:47:57,591
[SPEAKER_08]: We're actually having a discussion about food in the chat room.

717
00:47:57,991 --> 00:47:58,592
[SPEAKER_03]: What kind of food?

718
00:47:59,152 --> 00:47:59,793
[SPEAKER_08]: Jewish food.

719
00:48:00,193 --> 00:48:03,016
[SPEAKER_03]: All I see, I see roly poly fish heads from Jessica Harper.

720
00:48:03,056 --> 00:48:03,617
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not food.

721
00:48:04,057 --> 00:48:04,898
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't eat fish heads.

722
00:48:05,238 --> 00:48:06,719
[SPEAKER_08]: Although I did eat something very unique.

723
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:09,302
[SPEAKER_08]: I had herring in sour cream.

724
00:48:10,486 --> 00:48:11,626
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

725
00:48:28,713 --> 00:48:30,253
[SPEAKER_03]: He made his own little... He did the chicken.

726
00:48:30,273 --> 00:48:31,954
[SPEAKER_03]: He did his own little breadcrumb thing.

727
00:48:32,014 --> 00:48:32,774
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really cute.

728
00:48:33,634 --> 00:48:33,974
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

729
00:48:35,575 --> 00:48:36,315
[SPEAKER_03]: Read the story.

730
00:48:36,775 --> 00:48:37,795
[SPEAKER_03]: Read the damn story.

731
00:48:37,875 --> 00:48:40,656
[SPEAKER_08]: That's so cute and gay.

732
00:48:42,456 --> 00:48:47,177
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, for LittleBigPlanet 2, there is good news.

733
00:48:47,217 --> 00:48:50,458
[SPEAKER_08]: That is, if you played a lot of LittleBigPlanet the first...

734
00:48:51,878 --> 00:48:58,922
[SPEAKER_08]: And that is the beta invites are going out, but it's just for people who are super active in LittleBigPlanet.

735
00:48:59,482 --> 00:49:05,886
[SPEAKER_08]: So I guess that they're checking people who create, upload, who play regularly.

736
00:49:07,046 --> 00:49:09,188
[SPEAKER_08]: So here's the major points.

737
00:49:09,648 --> 00:49:14,270
[SPEAKER_08]: And also, they're not actually out recruiting beta testers.

738
00:49:14,290 --> 00:49:16,952
[SPEAKER_08]: They're just sending the invites to people who play the game a lot.

739
00:49:17,772 --> 00:49:27,674
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of those points are you have to be 18 years or older and be a resident in a country which we operate the PlayStation Store.

740
00:49:29,174 --> 00:49:34,296
[SPEAKER_08]: The beta will be in English, so you have to provide feedback in English.

741
00:49:34,336 --> 00:49:40,677
[SPEAKER_08]: The beta test community and the existing LittleBigPlanet beta testers will automatically be included in the beta trial.

742
00:49:42,498 --> 00:50:01,575
[SPEAKER_08]: and it says please note that being selected for this beta does not give you access to other beta trials we may operate that's a big duh the last thing is that participation in the beta trials is subject to their beta trial agreement you have to agree which I pretty much think means you know don't go spilling all this crap to other people which you know is going to happen

743
00:50:05,083 --> 00:50:06,446
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's a good way to do it.

744
00:50:07,408 --> 00:50:11,075
[SPEAKER_08]: Because then they'll be giving it to people who understand the mechanics of the game.

745
00:50:11,716 --> 00:50:14,602
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, the more that you play something clearly, the more you understand it, right?

746
00:50:14,843 --> 00:50:15,264
[SPEAKER_08]: What, Rob?

747
00:50:17,092 --> 00:50:17,712
[SPEAKER_03]: You looked funny.

748
00:50:18,072 --> 00:50:20,633
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm reading chat and having fun with them.

749
00:50:21,473 --> 00:50:24,934
[SPEAKER_03]: But no, as far as the way they're doing the beta invites, it makes sense.

750
00:50:25,114 --> 00:50:25,554
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cute.

751
00:50:26,114 --> 00:50:26,834
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good way to do it.

752
00:50:27,154 --> 00:50:27,834
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think so.

753
00:50:28,614 --> 00:50:31,795
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I didn't really get that much into LittleBigPlanet, honestly.

754
00:50:31,815 --> 00:50:36,356
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I know I'm not getting invited, but I think that's a... Why not get your hardcore community in there?

755
00:50:36,376 --> 00:50:41,877
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they're the ones that are A, going to most be shocked by the changes and B, probably test it the most.

756
00:50:41,917 --> 00:50:42,957
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it makes sense.

757
00:50:43,377 --> 00:50:45,597
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm surprised they don't do the same thing with World of Warcraft.

758
00:50:45,877 --> 00:50:47,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, maybe that is how they send out the invites.

759
00:50:47,578 --> 00:50:48,758
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

760
00:50:48,798 --> 00:50:50,538
[SPEAKER_03]: There's other ways you can get one.

761
00:50:50,618 --> 00:50:51,138
[SPEAKER_03]: I got one.

762
00:50:51,579 --> 00:50:53,019
[SPEAKER_03]: I probably shouldn't have it, but I do.

763
00:50:54,439 --> 00:50:55,859
[SPEAKER_06]: Touch you.

764
00:50:56,419 --> 00:50:57,760
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually haven't played it a whole lot.

765
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:01,340
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot is still borked in the World of Warcraft beta.

766
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:03,941
[SPEAKER_03]: What I really want in right now is the DC Universe beta.

767
00:51:04,681 --> 00:51:06,241
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I really want to play right now.

768
00:51:06,621 --> 00:51:08,782
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not going to play Star Trek Online.

769
00:51:08,802 --> 00:51:10,442
[SPEAKER_08]: You need to give that card to someone who will.

770
00:51:11,082 --> 00:51:12,823
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll give it back if you really want it.

771
00:51:12,883 --> 00:51:14,063
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll check it out someday.

772
00:51:14,083 --> 00:51:15,144
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to play with me.

773
00:51:15,964 --> 00:51:16,524
[SPEAKER_03]: For ten days?

774
00:51:16,865 --> 00:51:17,485
[SPEAKER_08]: For ten days.

775
00:51:18,565 --> 00:51:21,386
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll go kill some Borg and then smack some Klingons around.

776
00:51:21,406 --> 00:51:21,867
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll be fun.

777
00:51:22,467 --> 00:51:22,827
[SPEAKER_03]: Good times.

778
00:51:23,287 --> 00:51:27,249
[SPEAKER_03]: There's got to be at least one other OLR listener that plays Star Trek Online.

779
00:51:27,329 --> 00:51:29,450
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll have to hunt down Travis because he plays.

780
00:51:29,650 --> 00:51:29,950
[SPEAKER_03]: Does he?

781
00:51:30,150 --> 00:51:30,370
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

782
00:51:31,170 --> 00:51:33,612
[SPEAKER_03]: I would play just to attack his ship in the middle of the night.

783
00:51:33,852 --> 00:51:35,172
[SPEAKER_08]: You'd have to play a Klingon.

784
00:51:35,272 --> 00:51:35,792
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob!

785
00:51:36,153 --> 00:51:37,073
[SPEAKER_08]: I think you'd have to play a Klingon.

786
00:51:38,277 --> 00:51:38,537
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

787
00:51:38,817 --> 00:51:43,218
[SPEAKER_08]: And that means that you'd actually have to level up a character to, like, I think, Lieutenant Commander before you could actually play a Klingon?

788
00:51:43,238 --> 00:51:43,758
[SPEAKER_03]: Could I be like B'Elanna?

789
00:51:43,798 --> 00:51:44,579
[SPEAKER_03]: She was pretty fierce.

790
00:51:44,659 --> 00:51:47,319
[SPEAKER_03]: Could I be like B'Elanna, the half Klingon, half human?

791
00:51:47,499 --> 00:51:53,101
[SPEAKER_08]: You can sort of make one in... You get this selection... I don't know how we got from LittleBigPlanet... Wait, wait, wait.

792
00:51:53,281 --> 00:51:55,461
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, we just broke the show with too much nerdiness.

793
00:51:56,081 --> 00:51:56,982
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's too bad.

794
00:51:58,282 --> 00:52:02,483
[SPEAKER_08]: You get an option to choose Alien, and then you can customize him however you want him to look.

795
00:52:02,723 --> 00:52:02,943
[SPEAKER_08]: I see.

796
00:52:04,054 --> 00:52:11,680
[SPEAKER_04]: Digital Distribution seems to be catching on everywhere else, so why not the arcade?

797
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:19,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Taito is going to at least try it, and they've introduced a new digital distribution system called Nessica X Live.

798
00:52:20,666 --> 00:52:25,590
[SPEAKER_04]: This was being shown off at the 48th Amusement Machine Show in Chiba.

799
00:52:26,650 --> 00:52:37,574
[SPEAKER_04]: and apparently it will allow arcade operators to purchase cabinets and then download games to the cabinets including a bunch of older titles as well as brand new releases.

800
00:52:38,454 --> 00:52:50,558
[SPEAKER_04]: They said that nine arcade game makers are supporting the platform including SNK and Cave and the first title release for the system will be none other than Taito's BlazBlue Continuum Shift 2.

801
00:52:51,939 --> 00:52:58,836
[SPEAKER_04]: and um that's kind of interesting I don't know if I'll ever make it out over here like that I mean I don't see why not but um

802
00:53:00,208 --> 00:53:00,648
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

803
00:53:22,506 --> 00:53:26,430
[SPEAKER_04]: I just have a feeling these will be easily dumped and stolen.

804
00:53:26,450 --> 00:53:27,571
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, that's the first thing you think about.

805
00:53:27,591 --> 00:53:41,646
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, no, seriously, if you think about it, because it's going to have basically the same front end that's going to be running all these games, and all you're going to be doing is exchanging out the actual game data.

806
00:53:41,786 --> 00:53:44,869
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you put out that...

807
00:53:46,230 --> 00:53:47,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Arcade Games Elite

808
00:54:05,530 --> 00:54:07,191
[SPEAKER_03]: Have we seen this happen to some extent already?

809
00:54:07,272 --> 00:54:08,092
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a little bit?

810
00:54:08,372 --> 00:54:12,276
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I know some of the later Bomani games do this with the whole emusement and so forth.

811
00:54:12,356 --> 00:54:14,037
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think Technica does the same thing.

812
00:54:14,317 --> 00:54:17,660
[SPEAKER_03]: And I even think some of the fighting games are doing this now with some type of digital delivery, right?

813
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:31,751
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's a good idea in the sense that it will save arcade operators, at least if they were to implement this in the States, a whole lot of shipping costs because shipping arcade games is not cheap at all.

814
00:54:32,492 --> 00:54:33,413
[SPEAKER_08]: You know that firsthand.

815
00:54:34,854 --> 00:54:35,975
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, somewhat.

816
00:54:37,696 --> 00:54:41,679
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that, too, because I priced trying to get a baby Pac-Man machine because that's how bad I wanted one.

817
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:44,502
[SPEAKER_03]: And honestly, the machine itself, I could afford it.

818
00:54:44,522 --> 00:54:47,184
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the shipping that was going to kill me to get one of those machines.

819
00:54:47,944 --> 00:54:49,806
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how bad I want that stupid machine.

820
00:54:50,246 --> 00:54:51,107
[SPEAKER_03]: A baby Pac-Man?

821
00:54:51,127 --> 00:54:51,948
[SPEAKER_03]: A baby Pac-Man.

822
00:54:52,988 --> 00:54:53,389
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

823
00:54:53,749 --> 00:54:54,129
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

824
00:54:54,530 --> 00:54:57,792
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll track one down for you.

825
00:54:57,812 --> 00:54:58,873
[SPEAKER_03]: Finding one locally, maybe.

826
00:54:58,893 --> 00:54:59,434
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be cool.

827
00:55:00,635 --> 00:55:02,356
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, shipping is expensive.

828
00:55:02,576 --> 00:55:02,816
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

829
00:55:05,745 --> 00:55:09,388
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, granted that they wouldn't be shipping out a new cabinet each time.

830
00:55:09,469 --> 00:55:15,373
[SPEAKER_04]: They would just be doing a cartridge or something like that if it were any other system.

831
00:55:15,493 --> 00:55:22,739
[SPEAKER_04]: But even still, I mean, that's one less expense they have to deal with, although then they have to have internet.

832
00:55:22,779 --> 00:55:24,321
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe it evens itself out.

833
00:55:24,761 --> 00:55:28,584
[SPEAKER_04]: But at least when a game is released, they can have it there relatively quick.

834
00:55:29,385 --> 00:55:31,847
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if you were overnight a cabinet from...

835
00:55:33,368 --> 00:55:34,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Japan or something like that.

836
00:55:34,289 --> 00:55:35,829
[SPEAKER_03]: That would cost millions of dollars.

837
00:55:36,069 --> 00:55:39,771
[SPEAKER_03]: That boat would have to go very fast to get the machine over here.

838
00:55:39,791 --> 00:55:40,231
[SPEAKER_03]: Speedboat.

839
00:55:41,392 --> 00:55:42,232
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm dragging it behind.

840
00:55:43,233 --> 00:55:46,334
[SPEAKER_03]: You'd have to get Johnny Quest to get that machine out here that fast.

841
00:55:48,075 --> 00:55:48,536
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

842
00:55:48,636 --> 00:55:54,419
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think it's a really interesting idea and I could see arcades going that way, but is it going to be enough to save them?

843
00:55:54,719 --> 00:55:55,119
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

844
00:55:56,039 --> 00:55:57,240
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that all comes down to the games.

845
00:55:57,660 --> 00:55:59,661
[SPEAKER_04]: No one gives a crap how the games get to the arcade.

846
00:55:59,681 --> 00:56:01,282
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just what games are at the arcade.

847
00:56:02,768 --> 00:56:03,569
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think they could do?

848
00:56:03,609 --> 00:56:06,911
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have this conversation once in a while on the show, and I'll open this up to the chat, too.

849
00:56:07,252 --> 00:56:09,533
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think they could do to an arcade to make people come back?

850
00:56:10,194 --> 00:56:12,976
[SPEAKER_04]: Give them something that they can't get at home with consoles.

851
00:56:13,977 --> 00:56:14,658
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really it.

852
00:56:15,198 --> 00:56:21,823
[SPEAKER_04]: And right now, it's very difficult to come up with that kind of stuff because...

853
00:56:23,558 --> 00:56:26,119
[SPEAKER_03]: Lately it's community for the past 10 years or so.

854
00:56:26,719 --> 00:56:31,281
[SPEAKER_03]: DDR community, obviously, with this show owes its roots to.

855
00:56:31,421 --> 00:56:32,302
[SPEAKER_03]: Or fighting game community.

856
00:56:32,322 --> 00:56:34,523
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't readily get that stuff at home.

857
00:56:35,163 --> 00:56:44,727
[SPEAKER_04]: You can buy some homemade or really expensive dance pads and stuff, but it's still not the same as the arcade.

858
00:56:45,087 --> 00:56:49,369
[SPEAKER_04]: But now, though, with Guitar Hero and stuff, Guitar Freaks is kind of...

859
00:56:51,430 --> 00:57:15,588
[SPEAKER_04]: SSJ100 Matt in chat says free blowjobs, insert quarter, insert wiener That's not an arcade game, that's a peep show Free spankings Or like an Asian massage parlor, that is not an arcade Was that during the part of the marathon you were here for?

860
00:57:16,259 --> 00:57:18,682
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think I was here for any part of the marathon.

861
00:57:19,162 --> 00:57:20,483
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember if it was in the first three hours.

862
00:57:20,563 --> 00:57:23,946
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I think that you were gone, but Rob played this funny YouTube video.

863
00:57:23,966 --> 00:57:24,467
[SPEAKER_03]: It was Alan.

864
00:57:24,707 --> 00:57:25,488
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Alan played it.

865
00:57:25,528 --> 00:57:26,188
[SPEAKER_03]: What was it?

866
00:57:27,029 --> 00:57:27,770
[SPEAKER_03]: The happy ending.

867
00:57:28,430 --> 00:57:28,911
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, great.

868
00:57:29,551 --> 00:57:30,092
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll find it.

869
00:57:30,132 --> 00:57:30,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep talking.

870
00:57:30,732 --> 00:57:31,213
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep talking.

871
00:57:31,973 --> 00:57:32,674
[SPEAKER_06]: Get ready to wreck.

872
00:57:33,174 --> 00:57:37,056
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, I don't know if there's a lot that they can do to revitalize.

873
00:57:37,096 --> 00:57:43,899
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just basically bringing out games that are going to be able to do stuff that you can't really do at home.

874
00:57:43,939 --> 00:57:45,980
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the big old gun games.

875
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:49,822
[SPEAKER_04]: Just giving people a reason to come to the arcade, kind of.

876
00:57:51,022 --> 00:57:53,303
[SPEAKER_03]: This is from Mediocre Films on YouTube.

877
00:57:53,343 --> 00:57:54,284
[SPEAKER_03]: They get full credit for this.

878
00:57:54,364 --> 00:57:56,625
[SPEAKER_03]: Mediocre Films is the name of the YouTube here.

879
00:57:56,685 --> 00:58:00,146
[SPEAKER_03]: This is called... Happy Ending.

880
00:58:00,687 --> 00:58:01,507
[SPEAKER_03]: Here you go, Loki.

881
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:03,068
[SPEAKER_08]: Link it in the chatroom, too.

882
00:58:03,088 --> 00:58:08,911
[SPEAKER_06]: You like?

883
00:58:09,811 --> 00:58:10,391
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that's nice.

884
00:58:12,352 --> 00:58:12,492
Oh.

885
00:58:14,133 --> 00:58:14,353
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh.

886
00:58:16,134 --> 00:58:16,234
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh.

887
00:58:21,416 --> 00:58:25,747
[SPEAKER_03]: She's sitting on his butt I love the generic Asian restaurant music they play in the background

888
00:58:43,784 --> 00:58:44,705
[SPEAKER_03]: She just took her dress off.

889
00:58:44,745 --> 00:58:45,565
[SPEAKER_03]: You liking this, Loki?

890
00:58:46,006 --> 00:58:46,686
[SPEAKER_03]: Good movie, huh?

891
00:58:47,527 --> 00:58:49,348
[SPEAKER_08]: His head is totally not laying on there right.

892
00:58:50,068 --> 00:58:52,290
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not supposed to lay on the little... You want a happy ending?

893
00:58:52,950 --> 00:58:53,831
[SPEAKER_09]: Fifty dollars.

894
00:59:03,717 --> 00:59:13,421
[SPEAKER_08]: There's like clowns and a juggler and puppets and balloons and a... This is what they need in arcades!

895
00:59:16,963 --> 00:59:17,523
[SPEAKER_06]: And they all leave.

896
00:59:18,363 --> 00:59:18,983
[SPEAKER_06]: She's clapping.

897
00:59:19,264 --> 00:59:20,264
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you happy now?

898
00:59:22,185 --> 00:59:24,506
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it really wasn't what I was hoping for.

899
00:59:25,206 --> 00:59:26,066
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no.

900
00:59:27,147 --> 00:59:29,368
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you want a handjob.

901
00:59:30,048 --> 00:59:30,768
[SPEAKER_00]: Fifty dollars.

902
00:59:31,909 --> 00:59:32,189
[SPEAKER_00]: For a

903
00:59:33,396 --> 00:59:39,618
[SPEAKER_00]: Handjob, right?

904
00:59:41,878 --> 00:59:44,659
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, handjob.

905
00:59:44,819 --> 00:59:45,519
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, okay.

906
00:59:45,859 --> 00:59:46,379
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

907
00:59:46,619 --> 00:59:47,439
[SPEAKER_03]: Handjob!

908
00:59:47,459 --> 00:59:47,639
[SPEAKER_03]: Get it?

909
00:59:47,659 --> 00:59:48,720
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a hand jive.

910
00:59:48,740 --> 00:59:49,800
[SPEAKER_03]: Like grease.

911
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:52,881
[SPEAKER_03]: See, wasn't that worth derailing the entire show to watch?

912
00:59:52,901 --> 00:59:53,801
Yes, it was.

913
01:00:03,163 --> 01:00:04,284
[SPEAKER_03]: PSP Go Did you like that segue?

914
01:00:24,928 --> 01:00:27,311
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh

915
01:00:41,966 --> 01:00:47,008
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we need to make sure we have as many titles available to download as possible to make the experience as easy as possible.

916
01:01:01,673 --> 01:01:20,803
[SPEAKER_03]: but also pricing is perhaps an issue because of the cost reductions we've been able to do over the years the traditional PSP has benefited but the PSP Go is a completely different design so the cost trend is different so there you go no I don't

917
01:01:24,642 --> 01:01:27,764
[SPEAKER_03]: was maybe pricing the problem with the PSP Go.

918
01:01:27,784 --> 01:01:37,869
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe, or perhaps that you put out SKU with less features and then, I don't know, offered it for a more expensive price.

919
01:01:38,129 --> 01:01:39,550
[SPEAKER_03]: It's more expensive, yeah.

920
01:01:40,071 --> 01:01:45,974
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, I don't know, just utterly stopped supporting it because you haven't really released any sort of bundles.

921
01:01:46,374 --> 01:01:51,097
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's because you can't bundle anything with it because it doesn't have a UMD drive to play the games that would be bundled with it.

922
01:01:52,157 --> 01:01:52,758
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, fun.

923
01:01:52,778 --> 01:01:55,460
[SPEAKER_03]: You could give a card for a free download.

924
01:01:55,860 --> 01:01:56,521
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

925
01:01:56,761 --> 01:01:57,982
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody likes cards.

926
01:01:58,422 --> 01:02:02,125
[SPEAKER_03]: Dungeon Buster in our chatroom says, Thank you for giving me work to do.

927
01:02:02,185 --> 01:02:04,047
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I have to go online and download the title.

928
01:02:04,487 --> 01:02:09,671
[SPEAKER_03]: Dungeon Buster in our chatroom at chat.orange.com says, I love how Sony spins failure.

929
01:02:10,852 --> 01:02:12,935
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a good spin of failure, don't you think?

930
01:02:12,995 --> 01:02:22,107
[SPEAKER_03]: Perhaps, perhaps, just maybe it was possibly the fact that the pricing is what ruined it.

931
01:02:22,167 --> 01:02:23,148
[SPEAKER_03]: Just perhaps.

932
01:02:24,568 --> 01:02:40,553
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure we have some analysts we're paying money to look into right now but perhaps let me tell you for free yes that was the issue it was definitely the pricing was the issue pricing for flimsy piece of crap

933
01:02:41,813 --> 01:02:44,615
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw a PSP go on one of those fancy vending machines the other day.

934
01:02:44,635 --> 01:02:45,796
[SPEAKER_03]: It kind of made me laugh a little bit.

935
01:02:46,236 --> 01:02:52,840
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, there was somebody in one of my history classes that had it before class, and I said, okay, you've got to let me see that.

936
01:02:53,741 --> 01:02:56,723
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried playing it a little bit, and I was like... That mic is not your friend right now.

937
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:57,243
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

938
01:02:57,644 --> 01:02:58,905
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm holding it together.

939
01:02:59,085 --> 01:03:00,706
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just saying, it's cutting in and out.

940
01:03:01,466 --> 01:03:03,808
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't write the rules of electronics.

941
01:03:03,888 --> 01:03:05,469
[SPEAKER_03]: I just tell you what it is.

942
01:03:07,273 --> 01:03:07,513
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob.

943
01:03:07,973 --> 01:03:08,193
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes?

944
01:03:09,534 --> 01:03:10,895
[SPEAKER_03]: Person in your electronics class.

945
01:03:12,236 --> 01:03:19,639
[SPEAKER_08]: At any rate, I got to play one because a guy in one of my history classes was playing one and I said, you gotta let me try it.

946
01:03:20,039 --> 01:03:21,600
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, yeah, piece of crap.

947
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:28,163
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, you're not going to appreciate this, but I know we're talking about the PSP Go right now and it really smells like Shermie took a caca.

948
01:03:28,203 --> 01:03:29,944
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, is it just me that smells that?

949
01:03:30,765 --> 01:03:31,885
[SPEAKER_04]: She went go.

950
01:03:33,586 --> 01:03:35,107
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to see if she really did take a caca.

951
01:03:42,136 --> 01:03:45,997
[SPEAKER_03]: Your cat has impeccable comic timing, I just want to say.

952
01:03:47,377 --> 01:03:49,077
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think DarkSakura appreciates that.

953
01:03:52,478 --> 01:03:55,159
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think we're allowed to talk about the PSP Go anymore.

954
01:04:02,748 --> 01:04:09,112
[SPEAKER_03]: And what stinks is that DarkSakura has the next story, so we'll just sit here and think about that for a moment.

955
01:04:11,633 --> 01:04:11,914
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

956
01:04:13,775 --> 01:04:14,415
[SPEAKER_03]: Poopy butt.

957
01:04:15,796 --> 01:04:17,017
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that right, Mike?

958
01:04:17,077 --> 01:04:18,438
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to say this.

959
01:04:18,738 --> 01:04:26,322
[SPEAKER_08]: For the amount of stink that comes out of that cat's ass, her poop, her little poop, was about the size of an Ikea meatball.

960
01:04:29,093 --> 01:04:30,714
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for that comparison.

961
01:04:30,994 --> 01:04:33,116
[SPEAKER_03]: Swedish meatballs will never be the same.

962
01:04:33,216 --> 01:04:38,340
[SPEAKER_08]: That means that she couldn't even give a full-sized cat crap about the PSP Go.

963
01:04:39,260 --> 01:04:40,061
[SPEAKER_08]: I love my cat.

964
01:04:40,902 --> 01:04:43,644
[SPEAKER_08]: And she's sitting under the pinball table like, mm-hmm, I did it.

965
01:04:45,705 --> 01:04:47,086
[SPEAKER_08]: A little sassy fat butt.

966
01:04:52,896 --> 01:04:55,498
[SPEAKER_08]: So, Need for Speed MMO, have you played it?

967
01:04:56,639 --> 01:04:57,179
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't.

968
01:04:57,699 --> 01:04:58,340
[SPEAKER_08]: Dan plays it.

969
01:04:58,560 --> 01:04:58,840
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah?

970
01:04:59,140 --> 01:05:02,583
[SPEAKER_08]: He actually really likes it, but you can only get up to level 10 before you have to actually pay for it.

971
01:05:02,703 --> 01:05:03,863
[SPEAKER_08]: Duh.

972
01:05:03,944 --> 01:05:11,769
[SPEAKER_08]: But not anymore, because Need for Speed World, once it hit 1 million registered users, it actually is now free to play.

973
01:05:12,149 --> 01:05:12,649
[SPEAKER_08]: No more charge.

974
01:05:13,690 --> 01:05:19,414
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you still have to buy boosts and double XP bonuses and that type of thing.

975
01:05:21,084 --> 01:05:25,911
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I hate the word, the combination microtransaction.

976
01:05:25,931 --> 01:05:26,993
[SPEAKER_08]: I just think it's stupid.

977
01:05:27,554 --> 01:05:30,278
[SPEAKER_08]: A transaction is a transaction.

978
01:05:30,658 --> 01:05:33,082
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just saying all those media sites use it.

979
01:05:33,102 --> 01:05:33,282
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

980
01:05:33,302 --> 01:05:34,424
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just kind of one of those things.

981
01:05:34,684 --> 01:05:35,405
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're all stupid.

982
01:05:36,226 --> 01:05:36,427
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

983
01:05:39,534 --> 01:05:42,595
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and it's like the gods above just pulled the cord on your mic.

984
01:05:44,516 --> 01:05:47,077
[SPEAKER_03]: Sony dislikes your comments about their transactions.

985
01:05:47,137 --> 01:05:49,738
[SPEAKER_08]: A transaction is a transaction.

986
01:05:50,118 --> 01:05:52,199
[SPEAKER_08]: They should just call it payment.

987
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:54,880
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to pay for this stuff.

988
01:05:55,501 --> 01:05:56,481
[SPEAKER_08]: Money is money.

989
01:05:57,161 --> 01:05:58,582
[SPEAKER_08]: A little money is still money.

990
01:06:00,057 --> 01:06:01,238
[SPEAKER_03]: and I'll see you next time.

991
01:06:13,727 --> 01:06:17,090
[SPEAKER_08]: It gives you points for how many cops get injured, I guess.

992
01:06:17,771 --> 01:06:17,831
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

993
01:06:17,851 --> 01:06:22,535
[SPEAKER_08]: Which is kind of wrong, but, you know, it's actually pretty cool.

994
01:06:22,936 --> 01:06:28,601
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they have just a couple of cars that you can pick from right now, at least at the level that he's at.

995
01:06:28,681 --> 01:06:34,667
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's like playing Need for Speed on the system, except you just truck all over the town on your computer.

996
01:06:35,543 --> 01:06:36,003
[SPEAKER_08]: He likes it.

997
01:06:36,724 --> 01:06:42,148
[SPEAKER_08]: He says that he would rather play it with a wheel than use the keyboard like he's been doing.

998
01:06:42,168 --> 01:06:42,829
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't imagine.

999
01:06:42,849 --> 01:06:43,929
[SPEAKER_03]: The keys are going to stink.

1000
01:06:43,970 --> 01:06:45,991
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe a 360 controller would work better, though.

1001
01:06:46,331 --> 01:06:46,612
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

1002
01:06:46,672 --> 01:06:47,492
[SPEAKER_03]: A little better than the keys.

1003
01:06:48,333 --> 01:06:50,975
[SPEAKER_03]: Zbun, our chatroom, says, You guys got to get a new mic for DarkSakura.

1004
01:06:51,215 --> 01:06:52,916
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope it's not the mic.

1005
01:06:52,956 --> 01:06:54,538
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the newest mic in the studio.

1006
01:06:55,018 --> 01:06:57,060
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably the cord, not the mic.

1007
01:06:57,160 --> 01:07:01,743
[SPEAKER_03]: Something maybe happened where the mic fell or something and shorted one of the wires.

1008
01:07:01,803 --> 01:07:02,464
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, but it's...

1009
01:07:03,044 --> 01:07:03,945
[SPEAKER_03]: It's something to do with that connection.

1010
01:07:03,965 --> 01:07:05,006
[SPEAKER_08]: It slides out just a little bit.

1011
01:07:05,147 --> 01:07:07,209
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that I just need to get a new mic cable.

1012
01:07:07,789 --> 01:07:08,790
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, hopefully that's it.

1013
01:07:08,871 --> 01:07:11,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Or we could take the mic cable from a working mic.

1014
01:07:12,214 --> 01:07:12,935
[SPEAKER_03]: That might be the solution.

1015
01:07:12,955 --> 01:07:14,457
[SPEAKER_08]: That one's not detachable.

1016
01:07:14,577 --> 01:07:15,037
[SPEAKER_08]: No, yeah, it is.

1017
01:07:15,678 --> 01:07:16,078
[SPEAKER_08]: At the bottom.

1018
01:07:16,659 --> 01:07:18,381
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe we could try that during the break and see if that works.

1019
01:07:18,401 --> 01:07:18,881
[SPEAKER_08]: That's fine.

1020
01:07:18,921 --> 01:07:19,402
[SPEAKER_08]: I can hold it.

1021
01:07:20,223 --> 01:07:21,224
[SPEAKER_08]: I can hold it!

1022
01:07:21,304 --> 01:07:22,445
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a big girl!

1023
01:07:24,349 --> 01:07:25,911
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1024
01:07:41,665 --> 01:07:42,265
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah!

1025
01:07:42,405 --> 01:07:43,106
[SPEAKER_04]: Halo Reach.

1026
01:07:43,166 --> 01:07:43,566
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

1027
01:07:43,586 --> 01:07:46,066
[SPEAKER_04]: That's out this week on the Xbox 360.

1028
01:07:46,646 --> 01:07:49,187
[SPEAKER_04]: And now here's everything else that doesn't really matter.

1029
01:07:49,667 --> 01:07:52,688
[SPEAKER_04]: Professor Layton and the Unwound Future comes out today.

1030
01:07:53,688 --> 01:07:54,608
[SPEAKER_04]: That's on the DS.

1031
01:07:54,768 --> 01:07:58,269
[SPEAKER_04]: Dawn of Heroes coming out on the DS as well this week.

1032
01:07:58,749 --> 01:08:00,289
[SPEAKER_04]: Deal or No Deal Special Edition.

1033
01:08:00,349 --> 01:08:01,209
[SPEAKER_04]: What's special about it?

1034
01:08:01,269 --> 01:08:04,170
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they updated some of the games so it's more like the TV show is now.

1035
01:08:04,450 --> 01:08:05,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Other than that, it's not that special.

1036
01:08:06,270 --> 01:08:08,331
[SPEAKER_04]: That will be out on the Wii this week as well.

1037
01:08:09,511 --> 01:08:11,413
[SPEAKER_04]: Deer Drive on the Nintendo DS.

1038
01:08:11,513 --> 01:08:13,534
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you can hunt deer on your DS.

1039
01:08:13,694 --> 01:08:14,715
[SPEAKER_04]: That's exciting, I guess.

1040
01:08:16,496 --> 01:08:17,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn deer.

1041
01:08:17,376 --> 01:08:18,217
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn you, deer.

1042
01:08:19,458 --> 01:08:23,620
[SPEAKER_04]: Painkiller Pandemonium on PC out this week.

1043
01:08:24,661 --> 01:08:25,422
[SPEAKER_04]: Fancy Nancy.

1044
01:08:25,442 --> 01:08:30,245
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that like Rush Limbaugh and other pill-addicted celebrities?

1045
01:08:30,525 --> 01:08:31,846
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a Doom clone.

1046
01:08:32,706 --> 01:08:37,031
[SPEAKER_04]: Fancy Nancy Tea Party Time on the DS Really?

1047
01:08:37,411 --> 01:08:39,374
[SPEAKER_04]: Really Can you say that one more time?

1048
01:08:39,614 --> 01:08:49,725
[SPEAKER_03]: Fancy Nancy Tea Party Time Fancy Nancy Fancy Nancy Tea Party Time What the hell do you do in Fancy Nancy Tea Party Time?

1049
01:08:49,745 --> 01:08:51,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm glad you asked

1050
01:08:53,553 --> 01:08:54,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's see.

1051
01:08:54,153 --> 01:09:01,636
[SPEAKER_04]: Fancy Nancy Tea Party Time is so awesome that it doesn't deserve either a high-res box shot or a synopsis.

1052
01:09:01,716 --> 01:09:06,418
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you want to remember, I believe that you have to... Oh, they're about books.

1053
01:09:06,518 --> 01:09:07,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on, hold on.

1054
01:09:07,158 --> 01:09:08,138
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a trailer here.

1055
01:09:08,299 --> 01:09:08,639
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

1056
01:09:08,779 --> 01:09:10,479
[SPEAKER_03]: Fancy Nancy Tea Party Time.

1057
01:09:10,519 --> 01:09:11,620
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's look here at a trailer.

1058
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:14,661
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, watching videos with the radio listeners.

1059
01:09:14,761 --> 01:09:15,421
[SPEAKER_03]: Always a good time.

1060
01:09:16,261 --> 01:09:16,842
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see here.

1061
01:09:19,338 --> 01:09:20,379
[SPEAKER_03]: She is pretty Nancy.

1062
01:09:20,899 --> 01:09:27,063
[SPEAKER_00]: In five short years, Fancy Nancy has enchanted the hearts and wardrobes of girls all over the world.

1063
01:09:28,383 --> 01:09:36,768
[SPEAKER_00]: With over 25 books and more than 10 million copies sold, Nancy adorns the New York Times bestseller list for over 200 weeks.

1064
01:09:37,209 --> 01:09:39,430
[SPEAKER_03]: So far, no mention of a video game, just saying.

1065
01:09:39,690 --> 01:09:41,071
[SPEAKER_08]: I wouldn't let my girl read that.

1066
01:09:41,551 --> 01:09:43,793
[SPEAKER_00]: And the party is just getting started.

1067
01:09:44,273 --> 01:09:45,674
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you let your girl read Twilight?

1068
01:09:46,488 --> 01:09:46,889
[SPEAKER_00]: Hell no!

1069
01:09:47,389 --> 01:09:52,536
[SPEAKER_00]: But she could be glamorous, extravagant, and posh.

1070
01:09:56,846 --> 01:10:05,088
[SPEAKER_08]: I would rather her be intelligent, confident, and not having to conform to anything like that.

1071
01:10:22,332 --> 01:10:23,095
[SPEAKER_03]: I found a tea set, I bet it's terrific

1072
01:10:29,144 --> 01:10:31,105
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if you're going to throw a tea party, you need a tea sack.

1073
01:10:31,125 --> 01:10:32,767
[SPEAKER_03]: It better damn be terrific.

1074
01:10:33,928 --> 01:10:34,768
[SPEAKER_00]: You're fired.

1075
01:10:35,309 --> 01:10:44,375
[SPEAKER_00]: Travel the neighborhood and put the party pieces together for the most fabulous, most marvelous, most spectacular soiree you can create.

1076
01:10:44,815 --> 01:10:47,798
[SPEAKER_00]: It is fabulous decor and accessories.

1077
01:10:48,258 --> 01:10:49,639
[SPEAKER_00]: A plethora of puzzles.

1078
01:10:49,679 --> 01:10:50,920
[SPEAKER_02]: This trailer goes on way too long.

1079
01:10:50,940 --> 01:10:51,721
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, cheese is a big word.

1080
01:10:51,781 --> 01:10:52,261
[SPEAKER_02]: This game is.

1081
01:10:52,521 --> 01:10:53,963
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, she said Plethora.

1082
01:10:54,023 --> 01:10:54,383
[SPEAKER_08]: She did.

1083
01:10:54,503 --> 01:10:56,785
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I'm a little more impressed, but other than that, no.

1084
01:10:57,686 --> 01:10:59,248
[SPEAKER_00]: An abundance of fun.

1085
01:10:59,448 --> 01:11:00,469
[SPEAKER_00]: Fancy Nancy.

1086
01:11:00,729 --> 01:11:03,552
[SPEAKER_00]: Now on your Nintendo DS and DSi.

1087
01:11:04,033 --> 01:11:05,074
[SPEAKER_00]: RSVP today.

1088
01:11:06,755 --> 01:11:08,998
[SPEAKER_02]: Will you be attending Fancy Nancy's tea party?

1089
01:11:09,778 --> 01:11:11,500
[SPEAKER_02]: We should send out an invite on Facebook.

1090
01:11:12,561 --> 01:11:14,183
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I will not.

1091
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:16,221
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, yeah.

1092
01:11:16,702 --> 01:11:17,764
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's on DS.

1093
01:11:17,865 --> 01:11:21,112
[SPEAKER_03]: Gamer Girl in chat says, the tea is laced with marijuana.

1094
01:11:21,853 --> 01:11:22,795
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a game I'd play.

1095
01:11:27,288 --> 01:11:29,389
[SPEAKER_03]: Maui Waui's Tea Party.

1096
01:11:29,429 --> 01:11:32,130
[SPEAKER_08]: Frisbee says Fancy Nancy in the Meth Lab.

1097
01:11:33,050 --> 01:11:44,494
[SPEAKER_04]: If you feel like killing something after hearing that trailer, Cabela's North American Adventure will be out on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Wii, and PSP, maybe the DS.

1098
01:11:45,634 --> 01:11:46,015
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1099
01:11:47,115 --> 01:11:48,415
[SPEAKER_04]: It's out on a lot of systems.

1100
01:11:48,455 --> 01:11:49,216
[SPEAKER_04]: You hunt stuff.

1101
01:11:49,516 --> 01:11:50,136
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody loves it.

1102
01:11:50,413 --> 01:11:55,455
[SPEAKER_03]: Salacious Pop wants to know if Fancy Nancy Fucked Your Man is coming out for Xbox Live Arcade.

1103
01:11:56,436 --> 01:11:58,397
[SPEAKER_03]: Dark Tetsuya says Harold and Kumar's Tea Party.

1104
01:12:00,218 --> 01:12:03,899
[SPEAKER_04]: Scooby-Doo and the Spooky Swamp out on the Wii and the DS.

1105
01:12:04,439 --> 01:12:08,081
[SPEAKER_04]: And I believe the PSP, maybe the PlayStation 2.

1106
01:12:08,681 --> 01:12:09,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Who cares?

1107
01:12:09,122 --> 01:12:09,562
[SPEAKER_04]: It sucks.

1108
01:12:09,762 --> 01:12:12,203
[SPEAKER_03]: Frisbee's suggesting Fancy Nancy and the Meth Lab.

1109
01:12:12,223 --> 01:12:13,944
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I said.

1110
01:12:13,964 --> 01:12:16,125
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what she's really gathering the supplies for.

1111
01:12:16,285 --> 01:12:16,845
[SPEAKER_03]: I said that one.

1112
01:12:17,045 --> 01:12:18,106
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought you said Dark Tetsuya.

1113
01:12:18,126 --> 01:12:18,346
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

1114
01:12:19,771 --> 01:12:20,751
[SPEAKER_04]: Truth or Lies.

1115
01:12:20,831 --> 01:12:31,915
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a game on the PS3, Xbox 360, and the Wii where apparently you are challenged to lie to your friends, I guess.

1116
01:12:32,015 --> 01:12:33,816
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really know what the hell the point of this is.

1117
01:12:34,956 --> 01:12:36,277
[SPEAKER_04]: Bring the party into your living room.

1118
01:12:36,297 --> 01:12:42,339
[SPEAKER_04]: Inspire hilarious discussions and learn about your friends as deep, dark secrets are revealed.

1119
01:12:42,399 --> 01:12:45,580
[SPEAKER_04]: It's time to uncover who's telling the truth and who is flat out lying.

1120
01:12:46,740 --> 01:12:50,142
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm guessing that it has some sort of way to tell if you're a liar or not.

1121
01:12:50,923 --> 01:12:51,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.

1122
01:12:51,563 --> 01:12:52,764
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise, this game is lame.

1123
01:12:55,846 --> 01:12:58,447
[SPEAKER_03]: AkumaJP suggests Fancy Nancy's happy ending.

1124
01:13:01,749 --> 01:13:03,170
[SPEAKER_04]: Fancy Nancy's handjob?

1125
01:13:04,211 --> 01:13:05,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Or fancy handjob, I guess.

1126
01:13:08,234 --> 01:13:14,840
[SPEAKER_04]: Legends of the Guardian, Owls of Gahool coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and DS this week.

1127
01:13:15,301 --> 01:13:17,563
[SPEAKER_04]: The tie-in with the brand new animated movie.

1128
01:13:18,123 --> 01:13:22,788
[SPEAKER_04]: Phineas and Ferb, right again on the DS if you like that cartoon series, I guess.

1129
01:13:25,230 --> 01:13:26,811
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura's like yelling from the other room.

1130
01:13:27,532 --> 01:13:27,732
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

1131
01:13:28,793 --> 01:13:30,094
[SPEAKER_08]: I freaking love Phineas and Ferb.

1132
01:13:30,435 --> 01:13:31,556
[SPEAKER_08]: That show is crack.

1133
01:13:32,396 --> 01:13:32,997
[SPEAKER_08]: I would play a game.

1134
01:13:35,661 --> 01:13:39,624
[SPEAKER_04]: and she has sipped the Disney Kool-Aid.

1135
01:13:41,325 --> 01:13:44,046
[SPEAKER_04]: Rocket Sports coming out on PlayStation 3 this week.

1136
01:13:44,066 --> 01:13:47,128
[SPEAKER_04]: This is very similar to the game that was out on the Wii.

1137
01:13:48,485 --> 01:13:49,565
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like Wii Sports.

1138
01:13:50,265 --> 01:13:57,827
[SPEAKER_04]: Lord of the Rings, Aragorn's Quest on the PlayStation 2, the PS3, the Wii, the DS, and the PSP.

1139
01:13:57,887 --> 01:14:02,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, the PS3 version works with the PlayStation Move and is equally lame.

1140
01:14:04,209 --> 01:14:06,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Gladiator Begins.

1141
01:14:06,609 --> 01:14:11,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a prequel to the Gladiator movie, but it is a Gladiator combat game.

1142
01:14:11,891 --> 01:14:14,531
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a lot of games I don't care about coming out this week.

1143
01:14:14,571 --> 01:14:16,392
[SPEAKER_04]: Me too, and I'm covering all of them.

1144
01:14:17,092 --> 01:14:19,954
[SPEAKER_04]: Alpha and Omega, it's a DS game based on a new animated movie.

1145
01:14:19,974 --> 01:14:22,536
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever end, Jesus, this US release has been going on for like an hour.

1146
01:14:22,836 --> 01:14:24,697
[SPEAKER_03]: Halo Reach comes out this week.

1147
01:14:25,798 --> 01:14:28,960
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Halo Reach is a mature game.

1148
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:32,282
[SPEAKER_04]: There are a lot of immature games out there.

1149
01:14:32,543 --> 01:14:36,225
[SPEAKER_03]: Chat room, quick poll, Halo Reach or Fancy Nancy?

1150
01:14:37,226 --> 01:14:38,046
[SPEAKER_04]: Please let me know.

1151
01:14:38,166 --> 01:14:41,769
[SPEAKER_04]: I will have you know that this is the second time that a Halo game has come out against Cabela's.

1152
01:14:42,069 --> 01:14:43,650
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe this year Cabela's will take it.

1153
01:14:44,330 --> 01:14:44,931
[SPEAKER_04]: You never know.

1154
01:14:47,768 --> 01:14:48,491
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways.

1155
01:14:50,417 --> 01:14:52,524
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and the Cabela's did have a version with a gun for the Wii.

1156
01:14:53,999 --> 01:14:55,380
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, I'm almost done.

1157
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:59,502
[SPEAKER_04]: Gormady, the Lords of Nature coming from Konami on the Wii and the DS.

1158
01:14:59,542 --> 01:15:00,923
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even know what that is, nor do I care.

1159
01:15:02,804 --> 01:15:03,485
[SPEAKER_04]: Yu-Gi-Oh!

1160
01:15:04,005 --> 01:15:06,547
[SPEAKER_04]: 50's Duel Transfer on the Wii.

1161
01:15:07,527 --> 01:15:07,868
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay.

1162
01:15:08,908 --> 01:15:12,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, the Halo Reach will be out in the Legendary and Limited Editions as well.

1163
01:15:13,171 --> 01:15:14,572
[SPEAKER_04]: A Game Called Swords on the Wii.

1164
01:15:14,592 --> 01:15:16,593
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder what you do in that.

1165
01:15:17,373 --> 01:15:19,795
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a tough one there.

1166
01:15:24,940 --> 01:15:48,789
[SPEAKER_03]: Fancy Nancy or Halo Reach Fancy Nancy Milfhouse Fancy Nancy goes to the strip club Halo Reach Fancy Nancy Reach Fancy Nancy Reach This is sad, it's split 50-50 Fancy Halo Reach Fancy Nancy Reach Around I'd much rather have Fancy Nancy Reach Fancy Nancy download content for Halo Reach I almost said Hello Reach Fancy Nancy Reach

1167
01:15:49,409 --> 01:15:55,934
[SPEAKER_03]: Fancy Nancy's Pap Smear, Fancy Nancy Please, more like Halo Reach Around, etc.

1168
01:15:56,034 --> 01:15:56,834
[SPEAKER_03]: It's half and half.

1169
01:15:57,515 --> 01:15:58,716
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what to think about that.

1170
01:16:00,737 --> 01:16:01,658
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I don't know.

1171
01:16:01,958 --> 01:16:02,839
[SPEAKER_04]: And two last things.

1172
01:16:03,239 --> 01:16:05,020
[SPEAKER_04]: The Phantasy Star Portable on the PSP.

1173
01:16:05,521 --> 01:16:11,145
[SPEAKER_04]: And finally, it's not really a game, but it's coming out this week, the PlayStation Move and all the wonderful components for that.

1174
01:16:12,180 --> 01:16:28,669
[SPEAKER_04]: and a goddamn thing on this website says that their stupid sports champions or whatever game is out despite the douchebag in the GameStop saying, well, it doesn't come out until the 17th.

1175
01:16:28,709 --> 01:16:31,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the bundle doesn't come out until the 17th, you idiot.

1176
01:16:32,851 --> 01:16:33,131
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

1177
01:16:33,171 --> 01:16:33,511
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you done?

1178
01:16:33,792 --> 01:16:34,252
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you finished?

1179
01:16:34,432 --> 01:16:34,772
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm done.

1180
01:16:34,832 --> 01:16:35,312
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you finished?

1181
01:16:35,472 --> 01:16:35,833
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you sure?

1182
01:16:35,853 --> 01:16:35,953
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1183
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:38,340
[SPEAKER_03]: XBOX 360 PlayStation 3

1184
01:16:54,597 --> 01:16:58,800
[SPEAKER_03]: See, I don't know, is Halo Reach as big of a deal overseas as it is here?

1185
01:16:59,100 --> 01:17:02,522
[SPEAKER_03]: I would think it's still like... Depends on the territory.

1186
01:17:02,722 --> 01:17:05,564
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a B game, but not like an A game, you know?

1187
01:17:05,664 --> 01:17:07,365
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still, it's up there, but not like way up there.

1188
01:17:07,965 --> 01:17:15,030
[SPEAKER_03]: PlayStation 3, Front Mission Evolved is there as well, as well as Mobile Suit Gundam Senkei Record UC0081.

1189
01:17:15,090 --> 01:17:16,451
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just a price reduction, though.

1190
01:17:16,591 --> 01:17:18,032
[SPEAKER_03]: That game's actually already been out.

1191
01:17:18,912 --> 01:17:23,254
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving over to the Nintendo Wii and seeing what glorious games they're getting over there in Japan.

1192
01:17:24,214 --> 01:17:26,795
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, DECA Sports 3 is this week.

1193
01:17:26,875 --> 01:17:28,015
[SPEAKER_03]: Wii to Sports 10.

1194
01:17:28,355 --> 01:17:31,856
[SPEAKER_03]: Shumoku comes out this week in the pretty popular DECA Sports series.

1195
01:17:31,896 --> 01:17:33,537
[SPEAKER_03]: That series does pretty well for Hudson, doesn't it?

1196
01:17:34,137 --> 01:17:35,598
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like Wii Sports never dies.

1197
01:17:37,659 --> 01:17:40,621
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing really notable on the PlayStation 2, but I do have the Nintendo DS.

1198
01:17:40,761 --> 01:17:42,602
[SPEAKER_03]: Jinsai Game QDS.

1199
01:17:42,622 --> 01:17:44,943
[SPEAKER_03]: Heisei no Dekigoto.

1200
01:17:45,004 --> 01:17:47,545
[SPEAKER_03]: That is also a price reduction that's moving into the best.

1201
01:17:47,986 --> 01:17:49,426
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, not a lot of new games this week.

1202
01:17:49,487 --> 01:17:52,969
[SPEAKER_03]: Although on the 18th, there's all these new covers coming out.

1203
01:17:53,089 --> 01:17:57,392
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to get covers for your DSi in different colors, you have that to look forward to.

1204
01:17:57,412 --> 01:17:58,893
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, this ought to be good, though.

1205
01:17:58,933 --> 01:18:00,754
[SPEAKER_03]: On the Sony PSP, here's a big week.

1206
01:18:01,274 --> 01:18:02,275
[SPEAKER_03]: Yu-Gi-Oh!

1207
01:18:02,335 --> 01:18:05,377
[SPEAKER_03]: 5D's Tag Force 5, because I know there's some closet Yu-Gi-Oh!

1208
01:18:05,417 --> 01:18:06,018
[SPEAKER_03]: fans out there.

1209
01:18:06,858 --> 01:18:36,450
[SPEAKER_03]: Dissida Final Fantasy Universal Tuning is ultimate hits so Square sometimes does this with their games they put out like kind of like an international version later on I'm assuming it's kind of this version of this also a game called Blue Roses Yosai To Aoi Hitomi no Senshitashi comes out this week and I think I think that's a hold on it's Blue Roses it's a strategy game I was looking at the title oh sorry it's it's an RPG pretty much

1210
01:18:39,344 --> 01:18:42,246
[SPEAKER_03]: This game's from Nipponichi Entertainment, who makes a lot of the games.

1211
01:18:42,286 --> 01:18:45,847
[SPEAKER_03]: Just looks like your typical Japanese RPG, honestly, with your little anime cutscenes.

1212
01:18:46,028 --> 01:18:46,548
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks cute.

1213
01:18:46,608 --> 01:18:47,048
[SPEAKER_03]: Looks cute.

1214
01:18:47,068 --> 01:18:48,929
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure there'll be some people who want to import that.

1215
01:18:49,409 --> 01:18:50,630
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it for Japanese releases.

1216
01:18:50,710 --> 01:18:51,831
[SPEAKER_03]: How about the Old Kingdom?

1217
01:18:52,411 --> 01:18:54,392
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, we have a number of things over there.

1218
01:18:55,813 --> 01:19:01,416
[SPEAKER_08]: Starting on the 14th, Halo Reach, and then Legend of the Guardians, The Owls of Gahool.

1219
01:19:02,316 --> 01:19:04,837
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not from that book that was that movie, right?

1220
01:19:05,258 --> 01:19:06,018
[SPEAKER_04]: A book and a movie, yeah.

1221
01:19:07,057 --> 01:19:19,991
[SPEAKER_08]: Scooby-Doo in the Spooky Swamp, Final Fantasy Tactics, The War of the Lions, Flight Control, Kung Fu Rider, PlayStation Move, Sonic Adventure, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Sports Champions, and Start the Party.

1222
01:19:27,999 --> 01:19:36,314
[SPEAKER_08]: And closing up the week on the 17th, we have Lionheart King's Crusade on PC, R.U.S.E., and Two Worlds 2.

1223
01:19:37,196 --> 01:19:41,203
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, there's a game coming out next week that totally makes me laugh by the name Deathspank.

1224
01:19:42,736 --> 01:19:43,237
[SPEAKER_08]: That's funny.

1225
01:19:43,857 --> 01:19:44,057
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

1226
01:19:45,758 --> 01:19:47,099
[SPEAKER_03]: Quick question from your chat room.

1227
01:19:47,139 --> 01:19:49,601
[SPEAKER_03]: Spyro's asking, what about Final Fantasy XIV?

1228
01:19:51,042 --> 01:19:53,404
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe it's out in two weeks on the PC.

1229
01:19:53,484 --> 01:19:54,264
[SPEAKER_03]: The end of the month.

1230
01:19:54,404 --> 01:19:59,127
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and my list for Japanese releases doesn't cover the PC, so I'm not sure when it's coming out of there.

1231
01:19:59,187 --> 01:20:04,231
[SPEAKER_03]: PlayStation 3 is not until next year, and I think that's the same, be it Japan or the US.

1232
01:20:04,291 --> 01:20:06,172
[SPEAKER_03]: I think PC's getting the first crack at that.

1233
01:20:06,792 --> 01:20:08,954
[SPEAKER_03]: And Collector's Edition is, what, the 22nd?

1234
01:20:09,734 --> 01:20:11,195
[SPEAKER_03]: I think regular people get in on the 30th.

1235
01:20:12,817 --> 01:20:14,759
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a little skeptical about Final Fantasy XIV.

1236
01:20:14,879 --> 01:20:15,200
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1237
01:20:15,680 --> 01:20:16,441
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm weird though.

1238
01:20:17,202 --> 01:20:18,523
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like I need to buy it.

1239
01:20:19,511 --> 01:20:42,804
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to give the retail game a good old fashioned college try I need to try it and see what I really think of it but then again I'm like oh wow but that beta was so bad but I don't know I'm really torn that's where I'm at we'll see to be continued it really depends probably like do I have money to spend on Final Fantasy 14 or not that's really what it's going to come down to probably

1240
01:20:44,522 --> 01:20:49,174
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's move on with some other news and we'll get to the classic game of the week here in just a little bit here on the show.

1241
01:20:49,255 --> 01:20:49,515
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki.

1242
01:20:50,698 --> 01:20:51,160
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, yes.

1243
01:20:51,641 --> 01:20:52,242
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so...

1244
01:20:53,723 --> 01:20:54,864
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of interesting.

1245
01:20:55,845 --> 01:21:04,210
[SPEAKER_04]: For the longest time, I remember Apple was so adamant about not supporting Flash in their applications.

1246
01:21:04,391 --> 01:21:06,832
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that may change soon, actually.

1247
01:21:06,872 --> 01:21:18,380
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to relax some of the iOS development restrictions, including the use now of third-party tools like Flash CS5.

1248
01:21:19,581 --> 01:21:23,303
[SPEAKER_04]: So, apparently, you know, new apps now can be developed with that in mind.

1249
01:21:24,743 --> 01:21:25,544
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of cool.

1250
01:21:25,804 --> 01:21:29,906
[SPEAKER_04]: So, maybe, I don't know, we'll get some more apps that way.

1251
01:21:29,986 --> 01:21:31,366
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe a better web browser.

1252
01:21:32,187 --> 01:21:33,787
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that mean it's easier to make apps now?

1253
01:21:33,807 --> 01:21:39,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, you know, people have been asking for an OLR app for forever and I just... Yeah, if you know Flash, I guess it could...

1254
01:21:39,930 --> 01:21:40,890
[SPEAKER_03]: I can think of a few things

1255
01:21:55,356 --> 01:21:56,017
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1256
01:22:20,151 --> 01:22:21,972
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkTouchStudio is suggesting an OLR and USL combined soundboard.

1257
01:22:43,104 --> 01:22:44,064
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, moving on.

1258
01:22:44,785 --> 01:22:45,145
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

1259
01:22:45,345 --> 01:22:45,985
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I like this.

1260
01:22:47,226 --> 01:22:50,767
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and TigerClock confirms the All Games app is still not back on the App Store.

1261
01:22:51,227 --> 01:22:55,489
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, maybe we need to put an app up there just so that there's something to tune into the radio show on the go.

1262
01:22:55,529 --> 01:22:55,849
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1263
01:22:56,209 --> 01:22:57,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Although I think Video Game Outsiders have one.

1264
01:22:58,810 --> 01:22:59,750
[SPEAKER_03]: And that show's plenty fine.

1265
01:22:59,790 --> 01:23:00,611
[SPEAKER_03]: I like what they do over there.

1266
01:23:02,251 --> 01:23:02,831
[SPEAKER_03]: Mario.

1267
01:23:03,211 --> 01:23:04,972
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a hacky Mario game.

1268
01:23:05,012 --> 01:23:05,312
[SPEAKER_03]: Not really.

1269
01:23:05,332 --> 01:23:06,712
[SPEAKER_03]: More like a homebrew Mario game.

1270
01:23:07,492 --> 01:23:08,733
[SPEAKER_03]: It's created by Ben Weber.

1271
01:23:08,813 --> 01:23:11,413
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a candidate for his PhD in computer science.

1272
01:23:11,453 --> 01:23:12,653
[SPEAKER_03]: He goes to UC Santa Cruz.

1273
01:23:13,114 --> 01:23:17,054
[SPEAKER_03]: He's programmed a game, and it uses sprites from Super Mario World.

1274
01:23:17,074 --> 01:23:18,115
[SPEAKER_03]: So you could say it's homebrew.

1275
01:23:18,695 --> 01:23:23,236
[SPEAKER_03]: But what this game does is it's called Infinite Adaptive Mario.

1276
01:23:23,816 --> 01:23:26,436
[SPEAKER_03]: And the level starts with moderate difficulty.

1277
01:23:26,916 --> 01:23:29,277
[SPEAKER_03]: But once you beat that, the next level gets harder.

1278
01:23:29,817 --> 01:23:31,818
[SPEAKER_03]: And by the way, harder means yes, it gets a lot harder.

1279
01:23:31,838 --> 01:23:34,479
[SPEAKER_03]: According to Weber, quote, So in other words, as you get smarter, so does the game.

1280
01:23:56,764 --> 01:24:04,504
[SPEAKER_03]: And in some cases, if you look at some of these screenshots, there's like 16 monsters on the screen at once, including piranha plants that just fly in midair.

1281
01:24:04,945 --> 01:24:06,108
[SPEAKER_03]: That seems really hard.

1282
01:24:06,613 --> 01:24:07,453
[SPEAKER_08]: That looks crazy.

1283
01:24:07,493 --> 01:24:08,294
[SPEAKER_08]: I was looking at it.

1284
01:24:08,474 --> 01:24:15,477
[SPEAKER_03]: The author put Infinite Adaptive Mario up against an AI program that completes randomly generated Mario levels.

1285
01:24:16,797 --> 01:24:18,698
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's this whole YouTube on how that goes.

1286
01:24:18,718 --> 01:24:20,199
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds kind of interesting, actually.

1287
01:24:20,839 --> 01:24:27,422
[SPEAKER_03]: You can download it on the website for UC Santa Cruz, but it is a little bit buggy.

1288
01:24:28,642 --> 01:24:54,505
[SPEAKER_03]: but that's kind of interesting although I kind of think has a Nintendo gone that direction a little bit like games don't get harder necessarily but didn't they put in that controversial quote-unquote system a little while back where the levels get easier or I guess the tutorials Luigi tutorials come up if you're screwing up like wasn't that in it was in the Mario versus game the new Super Mario Brothers Wii if you die like eight times in a level then you get the Luigi tutorial kind of interesting huh

1289
01:24:56,324 --> 01:24:58,185
[SPEAKER_08]: You suck, so we're going to teach you not to suck.

1290
01:24:58,305 --> 01:24:59,727
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, exactly.

1291
01:25:01,688 --> 01:25:02,769
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, you're playing that right now?

1292
01:25:04,030 --> 01:25:04,791
[SPEAKER_03]: I see you over there.

1293
01:25:04,831 --> 01:25:05,892
[SPEAKER_03]: You're playing it right now, aren't you?

1294
01:25:07,053 --> 01:25:07,574
[SPEAKER_04]: I think he is.

1295
01:25:07,774 --> 01:25:11,537
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to, yeah, except they don't tell you what the buttons are, which makes it difficult.

1296
01:25:11,777 --> 01:25:12,798
[SPEAKER_03]: That might be kind of difficult.

1297
01:25:13,899 --> 01:25:18,003
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, hey, let's get to the classic game of the week.

1298
01:25:18,063 --> 01:25:21,446
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a segment here on the show where we take a trip down memory lane...

1299
01:25:23,422 --> 01:25:30,068
[SPEAKER_03]: with the help of DarkSakura and her gaming vault to say, hey, here's a video game you little brats should be playing this week.

1300
01:25:30,748 --> 01:25:32,790
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not Mario this week, unfortunately.

1301
01:25:32,830 --> 01:25:33,731
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not related to this.

1302
01:25:33,751 --> 01:25:35,672
[SPEAKER_03]: But it is pretty cool, right, DarkSakura?

1303
01:25:35,752 --> 01:25:36,393
[SPEAKER_08]: Ice Cream Man?

1304
01:25:38,094 --> 01:25:38,855
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, the Ice Cream Man.

1305
01:25:38,875 --> 01:25:39,756
[SPEAKER_08]: The Ice Cream Man's outside.

1306
01:25:39,776 --> 01:25:40,697
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't do the segment.

1307
01:25:40,717 --> 01:25:40,957
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye.

1308
01:25:41,357 --> 01:25:41,737
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm kidding.

1309
01:25:43,639 --> 01:25:43,879
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1310
01:25:45,180 --> 01:25:46,461
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, the classic game of the week is?

1311
01:25:47,062 --> 01:25:47,662
[SPEAKER_08]: Moonwalker.

1312
01:25:48,703 --> 01:25:50,705
[SPEAKER_08]: Specifically, Michael Jackson's Moonwalker.

1313
01:25:51,067 --> 01:25:54,511
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, you know, not to be confused with Paula Abdul's Moonwalker.

1314
01:25:54,611 --> 01:25:56,392
[SPEAKER_08]: But I wanted to start off on the arcade version.

1315
01:25:59,356 --> 01:26:05,222
[SPEAKER_08]: Because the arcade version is... It's been hard to find lately, and it's different, of course, than the one we all remember on Genesis.

1316
01:26:05,922 --> 01:26:08,465
[SPEAKER_08]: Which I think is pretty cool.

1317
01:26:09,986 --> 01:26:11,648
[SPEAKER_08]: At any rate, going with the arcade version...

1318
01:26:13,843 --> 01:26:20,027
[SPEAKER_08]: You start off on sort of a... It's technically side-scrolling, but it goes diagonally.

1319
01:26:20,947 --> 01:26:23,929
[SPEAKER_08]: And you... It is a beat-em-up.

1320
01:26:24,009 --> 01:26:27,451
[SPEAKER_08]: You have magic powers to attack with instead of actually just punching them.

1321
01:26:27,591 --> 01:26:29,132
[SPEAKER_08]: And you can shoot magic at them.

1322
01:26:30,112 --> 01:26:35,295
[SPEAKER_08]: And you can also turn into the big robot from... Which is the best thing ever.

1323
01:26:36,136 --> 01:26:36,396
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1324
01:26:37,737 --> 01:26:38,077
[SPEAKER_03]: Just saying.

1325
01:26:38,738 --> 01:26:44,202
[SPEAKER_08]: And the player one is Michael in the white suit and hat with the blue shirt.

1326
01:26:44,282 --> 01:26:47,785
[SPEAKER_08]: And then second player is red with white.

1327
01:26:48,065 --> 01:26:49,806
[SPEAKER_08]: And the third one is black with red.

1328
01:26:50,307 --> 01:26:54,510
[SPEAKER_08]: And they all have those armands that Michael Jackson is going to be really fond of.

1329
01:26:56,391 --> 01:26:58,853
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you hear Michael's little scream there in between stages?

1330
01:26:59,534 --> 01:27:00,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow!

1331
01:27:00,554 --> 01:27:01,295
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on one more time.

1332
01:27:01,515 --> 01:27:02,676
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, let me run this back a little bit.

1333
01:27:03,737 --> 01:27:19,803
[SPEAKER_03]: he saves the kid, he goes in the door and then there's a cutscene round two, amusement quarter here we go although I love this little version of Smooth Criminal that plays in the background let's listen to a little bit of it

1334
01:27:32,075 --> 01:27:32,416
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway.

1335
01:27:34,057 --> 01:27:40,541
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, he's got the dance magic, which is sort of, I guess, the smart bomb for the game.

1336
01:27:41,542 --> 01:27:56,031
[SPEAKER_08]: And basically, you all get this sort of on-screen logo that you can activate, and then a spotlight lands on you, and you start to dance like regular Michael Jackson moves.

1337
01:27:56,572 --> 01:27:59,274
[SPEAKER_08]: And then all the enemies on the screen start dancing with you.

1338
01:28:00,974 --> 01:28:02,515
[SPEAKER_08]: One of his power-ups is Bubbles the Chimpanzee.

1339
01:28:22,897 --> 01:28:29,163
[SPEAKER_08]: Bubbles is in each level and every time you rescue him, he turns you into the giant robot.

1340
01:28:29,883 --> 01:28:31,324
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you can shoot lasers.

1341
01:28:33,246 --> 01:28:41,113
[SPEAKER_08]: Now for the console, of course this is what I'm sure people remember a lot more of, is the one that came out on the Genesis.

1342
01:28:42,822 --> 01:29:09,630
[SPEAKER_08]: and I like this one because when you go and do the dance magic thing when you're standing on the piano everyone does the whole smooth criminal dance and that was just sweet but that one was pretty cool and to go back to the songs that were in the game for the arcade version the cavern one was bad and the amusement quarter is smooth criminal the night street is beat it graveyard is another part of me and the evil fortress is another version of bad and then Billie Jean plays in the credits

1343
01:29:10,830 --> 01:29:15,072
[SPEAKER_08]: and then on the Sega Genesis one, which is more standard side-scroller.

1344
01:29:16,492 --> 01:29:35,240
[SPEAKER_08]: Stage one is Smooth Criminal, stage two is Beat It, stage three is Another Part of Me, stage four is Billie Jean, and then you can perform part of Bad, and then stage five is Bad with your special performance being Smooth Criminal, Beat It, Thriller, if you have the REV00 version, or Another Part of Me, which is the REV01.

1345
01:29:36,620 --> 01:29:42,382
[SPEAKER_08]: and he shouts woo and in some of the cutscenes he says who's bad?

1346
01:29:44,683 --> 01:30:05,292
[SPEAKER_08]: but he says his usual little catchphrases but for the ad for the Sega Genesis version it said that Thriller was supposed to be in the game but it wasn't it's just the dance attack that's in that one version in the last stage

1347
01:30:06,821 --> 01:30:11,124
[SPEAKER_08]: And of course, this isn't the only game that Michael Jackson has made appearances in.

1348
01:30:12,124 --> 01:30:14,906
[SPEAKER_08]: There was Space Channel 5 and Space Channel 5 Part 2.

1349
01:30:15,686 --> 01:30:18,108
[SPEAKER_08]: And he was a secret character in Ready to Rumble Boxing Round 2.

1350
01:30:19,529 --> 01:30:22,050
[SPEAKER_08]: So, uh... That's pretty cool.

1351
01:30:24,111 --> 01:30:25,012
[SPEAKER_08]: But there was, um...

1352
01:30:27,049 --> 01:30:33,713
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, did you know that they were working on a Michael Jackson The Experience game to be out on Xbox 360?

1353
01:30:33,973 --> 01:30:35,935
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it's coming out.

1354
01:30:35,995 --> 01:30:38,096
[SPEAKER_03]: It was going to be out later this year, but I think it got pushed back.

1355
01:30:38,336 --> 01:30:39,157
[SPEAKER_04]: Next year, yeah.

1356
01:30:39,217 --> 01:30:41,178
[SPEAKER_08]: It better be just like Moonwalker.

1357
01:30:42,023 --> 01:30:44,045
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's supposed to be just like, just dance.

1358
01:30:44,685 --> 01:30:45,486
[SPEAKER_04]: It's singing in it.

1359
01:30:46,547 --> 01:30:47,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Not bad.

1360
01:30:47,828 --> 01:30:57,757
[SPEAKER_08]: The game actually has a rating on, the PEGI has a rating for Wii's Virtual Console, so there's a talk that it should be out in Europe.

1361
01:30:58,858 --> 01:30:59,499
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's pretty cool.

1362
01:31:01,380 --> 01:31:01,861
[SPEAKER_08]: Cool game.

1363
01:31:01,881 --> 01:31:03,042
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

1364
01:31:03,062 --> 01:31:03,242
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

1365
01:31:03,607 --> 01:31:06,709
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't care if people say it sucks, I completely disagree, it's fun.

1366
01:31:06,729 --> 01:31:07,609
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it was a cool arcade game.

1367
01:31:07,629 --> 01:31:07,950
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1368
01:31:08,030 --> 01:31:08,490
[SPEAKER_03]: It was cool.

1369
01:31:08,610 --> 01:31:11,232
[SPEAKER_03]: On the Genesis it was a little wonky, but it was, you know, it was Michael Jackson.

1370
01:31:12,232 --> 01:31:12,953
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't have to be that good.

1371
01:31:12,973 --> 01:31:14,153
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all about the dance.

1372
01:31:14,273 --> 01:31:16,715
[SPEAKER_03]: But the best Michael Jackson game is Space Channel 5 Part 2.

1373
01:31:17,455 --> 01:31:19,877
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, especially when you break out into the whole thriller dance.

1374
01:31:20,337 --> 01:31:21,217
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that was awesome.

1375
01:31:21,278 --> 01:31:21,658
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.

1376
01:31:21,678 --> 01:31:28,642
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week, Michael Jackson's Moonwalker for the arcade, although Dark Sakura did reference the Genesis version as well.

1377
01:31:29,443 --> 01:31:32,784
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's going to do it for part A of our program, but it's not over yet, guys.

1378
01:31:32,804 --> 01:31:34,005
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got plenty more show to come.

1379
01:31:34,065 --> 01:31:37,846
[SPEAKER_03]: Your phone calls, your emails, rapid-fire news, and the tweets on Twitter.

1380
01:31:38,306 --> 01:31:46,409
[SPEAKER_03]: Talk of Guitar Hero invading the Twitters, and Rock Band 3 information, and a new character confirmed for Marvel vs. Capcom 3 this week.

1381
01:31:46,709 --> 01:31:50,590
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to talk about all of that when we come right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1382
01:31:57,182 --> 01:31:59,784
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

1383
01:31:59,824 --> 01:32:04,989
[SPEAKER_03]: It is episode number 381, live on this Sunday evening, September the 12th of 2010.

1384
01:32:06,450 --> 01:32:14,897
[SPEAKER_03]: We are live, of course, at All Games Radio, where we do tape our show live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.

1385
01:32:14,957 --> 01:32:16,919
[SPEAKER_03]: Although, next week, he's not going to be here.

1386
01:32:17,299 --> 01:32:18,160
[SPEAKER_03]: Sad.

1387
01:32:18,720 --> 01:32:21,503
[SPEAKER_03]: So, it'll just be us next Sunday holding down the fort.

1388
01:32:21,783 --> 01:32:22,583
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know what that means?

1389
01:32:23,244 --> 01:32:25,346
[SPEAKER_03]: We can take over the stream early if we want.

1390
01:32:25,366 --> 01:32:25,426
[SPEAKER_03]: Woo!

1391
01:32:26,436 --> 01:32:28,997
[SPEAKER_08]: We could take over the stream early and then go to bed early.

1392
01:32:29,057 --> 01:32:31,838
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobby assured me that there's no best of or anything next week.

1393
01:32:31,958 --> 01:32:35,099
[SPEAKER_03]: And the chatters are requesting another marathon.

1394
01:32:35,339 --> 01:32:35,619
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1395
01:32:36,139 --> 01:32:37,499
[SPEAKER_03]: No, are you crazy?

1396
01:32:38,040 --> 01:32:38,360
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1397
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:40,720
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not doing another marathon.

1398
01:32:41,201 --> 01:32:42,101
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll go live early though.

1399
01:32:42,181 --> 01:32:44,081
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll go live early.

1400
01:32:44,141 --> 01:32:44,962
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do a marathon.

1401
01:32:45,022 --> 01:32:49,243
[SPEAKER_03]: You can broadcast all day long and then I'll come in at 6 o'clock as will Loki.

1402
01:32:50,798 --> 01:32:51,800
[SPEAKER_03]: Alan may be here next week.

1403
01:32:51,820 --> 01:32:52,281
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure.

1404
01:32:52,681 --> 01:32:52,941
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1405
01:32:53,182 --> 01:32:53,482
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1406
01:32:54,424 --> 01:32:58,209
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll be coming in right in the middle of the rebirth of Pump Up the Volume.

1407
01:33:01,035 --> 01:33:01,575
[SPEAKER_03]: Good times.

1408
01:33:02,176 --> 01:33:02,656
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, we'll see.

1409
01:33:02,876 --> 01:33:03,317
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

1410
01:33:04,257 --> 01:33:06,579
[SPEAKER_03]: On our Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.

1411
01:33:07,059 --> 01:33:07,519
[SPEAKER_03]: Ranma Deer?

1412
01:33:08,100 --> 01:33:08,340
[SPEAKER_03]: Hush.

1413
01:33:08,520 --> 01:33:10,361
[SPEAKER_03]: They're already asking for an OLR-thon too.

1414
01:33:10,381 --> 01:33:10,782
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no.

1415
01:33:11,302 --> 01:33:11,822
[SPEAKER_03]: Too much.

1416
01:33:12,483 --> 01:33:14,444
[SPEAKER_03]: If you do it too much, then it loses its effect.

1417
01:33:14,504 --> 01:33:16,545
[SPEAKER_03]: It needs to stay like a once a year type of thing.

1418
01:33:17,246 --> 01:33:20,528
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, then again, the show as it is has already been going, what, eight and a half years?

1419
01:33:20,588 --> 01:33:23,890
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we even make it another year, that in itself is something to celebrate.

1420
01:33:23,950 --> 01:33:24,671
[SPEAKER_03]: So that'll be good.

1421
01:33:25,011 --> 01:33:26,072
[SPEAKER_03]: Think we'll make it to 10 years?

1422
01:33:26,292 --> 01:33:26,952
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a long time.

1423
01:33:27,493 --> 01:33:27,913
[SPEAKER_03]: That'll be good.

1424
01:33:27,973 --> 01:33:28,313
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not?

1425
01:33:28,333 --> 01:33:29,254
[SPEAKER_03]: It's only two more years.

1426
01:33:30,037 --> 01:33:31,578
[SPEAKER_03]: Not even two more whole years.

1427
01:33:31,718 --> 01:33:32,118
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

1428
01:33:32,258 --> 01:33:33,399
[SPEAKER_03]: We might make it to ten years.

1429
01:33:33,419 --> 01:33:34,439
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, coffee.

1430
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:35,620
[SPEAKER_03]: You have coffee?

1431
01:33:36,961 --> 01:33:37,861
[SPEAKER_08]: Nescafe, do you want some?

1432
01:33:38,061 --> 01:33:38,662
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it decaf?

1433
01:33:38,702 --> 01:33:38,882
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1434
01:33:40,363 --> 01:33:40,763
[SPEAKER_08]: It's good.

1435
01:33:40,983 --> 01:33:42,304
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, I'll try some.

1436
01:33:42,424 --> 01:33:42,884
[SPEAKER_03]: Fine!

1437
01:33:42,924 --> 01:33:43,564
[SPEAKER_03]: Freaking decaf.

1438
01:33:43,584 --> 01:33:45,565
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't have any creamer to put in it except for rice milk.

1439
01:33:46,286 --> 01:33:47,086
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if I have any left.

1440
01:33:47,146 --> 01:33:47,426
[SPEAKER_08]: That's okay.

1441
01:33:49,255 --> 01:33:49,976
[SPEAKER_03]: Woot, I'm getting coffee

1442
01:34:13,876 --> 01:34:20,839
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I could see that happening, and I doubt that they would make up stuff, so, um, it's possible.

1443
01:34:21,159 --> 01:34:24,721
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet we'd see it come out around the same time as The Last Guardian, so, um.

1444
01:34:26,417 --> 01:34:27,097
[SPEAKER_04]: Frank West Johnny Pipes

1445
01:34:54,063 --> 01:34:56,825
[SPEAKER_04]: recount seeing someone else fighting by green side.

1446
01:34:56,925 --> 01:34:58,586
[SPEAKER_04]: So I go after him, he says.

1447
01:34:59,627 --> 01:35:00,928
[SPEAKER_04]: But then I see some other dude.

1448
01:35:01,548 --> 01:35:02,769
[SPEAKER_04]: Vaguely recognized him.

1449
01:35:02,809 --> 01:35:04,870
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe saw him at a party a few years back.

1450
01:35:04,910 --> 01:35:05,711
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe a celebrity.

1451
01:35:05,731 --> 01:35:06,912
[SPEAKER_04]: Can't remember his name, though.

1452
01:35:07,552 --> 01:35:08,353
[SPEAKER_04]: Phil Floyd.

1453
01:35:08,393 --> 01:35:11,735
[SPEAKER_04]: Regardless, he was fighting zombies, too.

1454
01:35:11,855 --> 01:35:16,218
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like Oktoberfest, but replaced a beer with zombies and drinking with slaughter.

1455
01:35:16,578 --> 01:35:18,679
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like I died and gone to heaven.

1456
01:35:19,780 --> 01:35:19,880
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

1457
01:35:21,301 --> 01:35:42,485
[SPEAKER_04]: and of course I believe in one of the screenshots or they have these like photos or whatever um I thought I saw Frank West actually in there yes he is actually in that photo so I think it's inevitable he has to make a cameo somewhere in the game you know what I mean like he's got to be in it or people are just gonna be pissed you know and also there's two-player co-op

1458
01:35:43,827 --> 01:35:45,308
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, they haven't said what the second player is?

1459
01:35:45,588 --> 01:35:46,629
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope.

1460
01:35:46,809 --> 01:35:52,173
[SPEAKER_04]: In the demos it's been just you played another Chuck Green, but perhaps Frank West.

1461
01:35:52,273 --> 01:35:54,734
[SPEAKER_03]: Perhaps they'll charge you 500 points as DLC.

1462
01:35:54,894 --> 01:36:02,939
[SPEAKER_04]: Perhaps they will have like a second, you know, the second quest as you like to put it, where you can play as Frank West.

1463
01:36:05,301 --> 01:36:07,783
[SPEAKER_03]: I think more games need second quests.

1464
01:36:08,523 --> 01:36:09,944
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the original Legend of Zelda.

1465
01:36:09,964 --> 01:36:11,925
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, that's a hot, hot, hot, ow, that's a hot cup.

1466
01:36:12,726 --> 01:36:12,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Um,

1467
01:36:14,437 --> 01:36:19,979
[SPEAKER_04]: Console modder Ben Heck is getting his own show starting September 13th.

1468
01:36:20,419 --> 01:36:32,044
[SPEAKER_04]: You may remember him from such wonderful console mods as the Atari 2600 Portable and all the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 laptops he's made.

1469
01:36:32,784 --> 01:36:36,445
[SPEAKER_04]: He does a lot of modding for different game controllers and whatnot.

1470
01:36:37,145 --> 01:36:38,526
[SPEAKER_04]: But he will have his own show.

1471
01:36:38,586 --> 01:36:43,228
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to appear on apparently an internet TV channel called Revision3.

1472
01:36:45,598 --> 01:36:49,081
[SPEAKER_03]: and I guess... Isn't that the one that does all the dig shows, I think?

1473
01:36:49,802 --> 01:36:52,644
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe, and it's also going to be hosted on Element 14.

1474
01:36:52,744 --> 01:36:56,607
[SPEAKER_04]: So, it's interesting.

1475
01:36:56,768 --> 01:36:58,149
[SPEAKER_03]: Will it be on actual television?

1476
01:36:58,709 --> 01:36:59,110
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't know.

1477
01:36:59,470 --> 01:36:59,910
[SPEAKER_03]: Should, though.

1478
01:37:00,411 --> 01:37:00,991
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it should.

1479
01:37:01,752 --> 01:37:02,853
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be on Apple TV.

1480
01:37:02,893 --> 01:37:03,613
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where it'll be.

1481
01:37:06,176 --> 01:37:07,236
[SPEAKER_03]: Did the cat poop again?

1482
01:37:07,256 --> 01:37:11,940
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I found where she really pooped.

1483
01:37:11,960 --> 01:37:13,522
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura just found a surprise.

1484
01:37:16,075 --> 01:37:17,737
[SPEAKER_03]: Dissida Dissida Dissida

1485
01:37:34,096 --> 01:37:35,457
[SPEAKER_03]: and Duodecim.

1486
01:37:35,817 --> 01:37:36,958
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess that's how you pronounce it.

1487
01:37:37,018 --> 01:37:37,978
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all Latin-y words.

1488
01:37:38,439 --> 01:37:43,001
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it is in the issue of Shonen Jump, which is one of those magazines overseas.

1489
01:37:43,402 --> 01:37:45,203
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a sequel to Dissida Final Fantasy.

1490
01:37:45,223 --> 01:37:47,564
[SPEAKER_03]: It will be coming out on Japanese PSPs in 2011.

1491
01:37:48,225 --> 01:37:50,986
[SPEAKER_03]: Dissida Duodecim Final Fantasy.

1492
01:37:51,827 --> 01:37:58,391
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't know any new characters yet except for Final Fantasy IV's Kain and Final Fantasy XIII's Lightning.

1493
01:37:58,911 --> 01:37:59,511
[SPEAKER_03]: That'll be cool.

1494
01:37:59,851 --> 01:38:04,013
[SPEAKER_03]: No other players have been confirmed yet, but I imagine most of the roster from the first disc of the game.

1495
01:38:04,554 --> 01:38:08,035
[SPEAKER_03]: I know a lot of my friends were big fans of this game, so I'm sure they're going to be excited about that.

1496
01:38:08,115 --> 01:38:09,576
[SPEAKER_03]: More news on that when we know it.

1497
01:38:10,136 --> 01:38:17,259
[SPEAKER_03]: Meanwhile, for you Mac gamers, and I know there are some of you, you missed out on Grand Theft Auto 3 when it was the shit.

1498
01:38:17,419 --> 01:38:19,160
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, miss out on this no more.

1499
01:38:19,220 --> 01:38:24,382
[SPEAKER_03]: Grand Theft Auto 3, Vice City, and San Andreas, a big pack of games is coming out later this year.

1500
01:38:24,822 --> 01:38:28,244
[SPEAKER_03]: That is confirmed from Rockstar's Facebook for the Mac.

1501
01:38:28,784 --> 01:38:33,808
[SPEAKER_03]: No date yet or anything like that, but for you Mac gamers who missed out on that, I'm sure you're excited.

1502
01:38:34,569 --> 01:38:40,333
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know DarkSakura is going to be first in line for one of these on September 21st for the low, low price of $54.99, a pink DualShock 3.

1503
01:38:40,373 --> 01:38:40,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

1504
01:38:48,790 --> 01:38:50,712
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I like cleaning up Shermie's poop better.

1505
01:39:15,569 --> 01:39:15,990
[SPEAKER_03]: Need.

1506
01:39:16,250 --> 01:39:16,530
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob.

1507
01:39:16,590 --> 01:39:17,130
[SPEAKER_03]: Must have.

1508
01:39:17,211 --> 01:39:18,531
[SPEAKER_08]: There's something other than that coming out.

1509
01:39:18,692 --> 01:39:19,952
[SPEAKER_08]: Something I covered for Geek Life.

1510
01:39:20,012 --> 01:39:20,853
[SPEAKER_08]: Plug, plug, plug.

1511
01:39:21,173 --> 01:39:22,134
[SPEAKER_03]: Geek-life.com.

1512
01:39:22,214 --> 01:39:23,635
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, the collector's edition with the bike?

1513
01:39:24,195 --> 01:39:24,455
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1514
01:39:24,876 --> 01:39:28,738
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a keyboard and mouse coming out that has the blue lighting on it.

1515
01:39:29,379 --> 01:39:33,462
[SPEAKER_08]: And the mouse is like one of those super nice cushioned ergonomic really happy mice.

1516
01:39:33,482 --> 01:39:35,643
[SPEAKER_03]: I am such a consumer whore because I want all of it.

1517
01:39:36,184 --> 01:39:36,764
[SPEAKER_03]: I really do.

1518
01:39:36,864 --> 01:39:38,885
[SPEAKER_03]: I want the little PS3 controller.

1519
01:39:38,905 --> 01:39:39,366
[SPEAKER_03]: I want the keyboard.

1520
01:39:39,386 --> 01:39:39,826
[SPEAKER_03]: I want the mouse.

1521
01:39:39,846 --> 01:39:41,587
[SPEAKER_03]: I want the collector's edition of the game.

1522
01:39:42,008 --> 01:39:42,528
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sad.

1523
01:39:42,548 --> 01:39:42,688
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sad.

1524
01:39:42,848 --> 01:39:49,533
[SPEAKER_08]: If anyone wants to read about it, you can go to geek-life.com and look up my Geek Cube article from a couple weeks ago.

1525
01:39:49,554 --> 01:39:54,157
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, the shameless plug alarm is going off.

1526
01:39:55,318 --> 01:39:55,939
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's all good.

1527
01:39:56,919 --> 01:39:58,621
[SPEAKER_03]: I will have to go read about that right now.

1528
01:40:00,462 --> 01:40:01,923
[SPEAKER_03]: While DarkSakura does some other stories.

1529
01:40:02,824 --> 01:40:03,665
[SPEAKER_08]: Ruining my fun, Rob.

1530
01:40:05,487 --> 01:40:08,789
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, for a... And this is actually really cool.

1531
01:40:08,949 --> 01:40:11,069
[SPEAKER_08]: We were talking about this not too long ago.

1532
01:40:11,950 --> 01:40:17,212
[SPEAKER_08]: Borderlands is getting a free update that will raise the level cap and rebalance the game.

1533
01:40:17,752 --> 01:40:18,253
[SPEAKER_08]: Ooh.

1534
01:40:18,833 --> 01:40:21,034
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's, of course, across all the platforms.

1535
01:40:21,514 --> 01:40:23,175
[SPEAKER_08]: Xbox 360, PS3, PC.

1536
01:40:24,055 --> 01:40:26,336
[SPEAKER_08]: And this was announced at PAX, by the way.

1537
01:40:27,437 --> 01:40:31,118
[SPEAKER_08]: And the download content pack is called Claptrap's New Robot Revolution.

1538
01:40:32,099 --> 01:40:32,239
[SPEAKER_08]: And...

1539
01:40:34,193 --> 01:40:36,874
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be, I think, pretty good.

1540
01:40:37,094 --> 01:40:41,154
[SPEAKER_08]: There were some issues with the way the game played.

1541
01:40:41,314 --> 01:40:42,975
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, otherwise it was still really fun.

1542
01:40:43,695 --> 01:40:53,477
[SPEAKER_08]: And also, they just said it was going to be the level cap at 69.

1543
01:40:54,837 --> 01:40:55,257
[SPEAKER_08]: That's funny.

1544
01:40:55,797 --> 01:41:01,458
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be out on... It'll be released around October 12th when the Game of the Year edition comes out.

1545
01:41:02,578 --> 01:41:06,022
[SPEAKER_03]: KumaJP in chat just said the Xbox is getting one of those Tron controllers too.

1546
01:41:06,322 --> 01:41:06,723
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn it!

1547
01:41:07,243 --> 01:41:08,785
[SPEAKER_03]: That's another thing I'm going to have to buy now.

1548
01:41:11,824 --> 01:41:16,948
[SPEAKER_08]: And then for next week's Rock Band download content, we've got some new stuff.

1549
01:41:17,448 --> 01:41:19,550
[SPEAKER_08]: We have Holy Diver by Dio.

1550
01:41:19,690 --> 01:41:21,591
[SPEAKER_08]: We have Stand Up and Shout by Dio.

1551
01:41:21,991 --> 01:41:24,393
[SPEAKER_08]: We have Nirvana, Juliana Hatfield.

1552
01:41:24,933 --> 01:41:26,654
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't heard any of her stuff in a long time.

1553
01:41:27,135 --> 01:41:28,196
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, she's still around?

1554
01:41:28,396 --> 01:41:28,976
[SPEAKER_03]: Making music?

1555
01:41:29,536 --> 01:41:31,118
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't heard her since like college.

1556
01:41:31,198 --> 01:41:32,879
[SPEAKER_08]: I think this is an older one.

1557
01:41:33,359 --> 01:41:34,880
[SPEAKER_08]: Irish Blood, English Heart by Morrissey.

1558
01:41:36,381 --> 01:41:37,222
[SPEAKER_08]: I love Morrissey too.

1559
01:41:37,242 --> 01:41:40,284
[SPEAKER_08]: This is totally like my college music.

1560
01:41:40,424 --> 01:41:40,784
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

1561
01:41:57,718 --> 01:42:00,261
[SPEAKER_08]: This Charming Man by the Smiths.

1562
01:42:00,341 --> 01:42:01,663
[SPEAKER_08]: It's also like Morrissey Week.

1563
01:42:02,404 --> 01:42:04,186
[SPEAKER_08]: And Writing on the Walls Under Oath.

1564
01:42:04,726 --> 01:42:06,488
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I might have to get some points.

1565
01:42:07,389 --> 01:42:09,572
[SPEAKER_08]: The list looks pretty awesome to me.

1566
01:42:10,913 --> 01:42:12,115
[SPEAKER_08]: Which, of course, are going to be...

1567
01:42:13,536 --> 01:42:28,769
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, the dollar amount is really all the same for them, but the Morrissey, the one that's Irish Heart, English Blood, This Charming Man, and Writing on Walls are going to be 160 Microsoft points each, while the others are 200 Wii points.

1568
01:42:28,789 --> 01:42:32,192
[SPEAKER_08]: They're all going to be on all the platforms, so.

1569
01:42:33,880 --> 01:42:48,610
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, last but not least, this is kind of funny, I think, is that they're putting out a Wiimote that's going to be coinciding with the Wii title, Doctor Who Returned to Earth.

1570
01:42:49,811 --> 01:42:53,033
[SPEAKER_08]: It's getting a Sonic Screwdriver Wii controller, and I think that's awesome.

1571
01:42:53,293 --> 01:42:57,436
[SPEAKER_08]: It's, of course, based after the current 11th Doctor's...

1572
01:42:59,097 --> 01:43:03,820
[SPEAKER_08]: Sonic Screwdriver, which honestly I still think that the best Sonic Screwdriver was 10th, but that's me.

1573
01:43:05,261 --> 01:43:13,646
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's also going to have the voices of Matt Smith, who's currently playing the Doctor, and his lovely redhead companion.

1574
01:43:13,966 --> 01:43:14,786
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be pretty cool.

1575
01:43:16,447 --> 01:43:17,928
[SPEAKER_08]: I might have to get that.

1576
01:43:17,948 --> 01:43:18,889
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope it comes out over here.

1577
01:43:20,610 --> 01:43:20,930
[SPEAKER_08]: It better.

1578
01:43:22,851 --> 01:43:23,532
[SPEAKER_03]: It very well might.

1579
01:43:23,732 --> 01:43:24,152
[SPEAKER_03]: You never know.

1580
01:43:26,229 --> 01:43:36,393
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, just completely random before we get into the Twitter topic, since DarkSakura brought up Rock Band, I know a friend of mine would be very upset if I did not mention Umlaut is officially announced for this year.

1581
01:43:36,433 --> 01:43:36,853
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember this?

1582
01:43:36,893 --> 01:43:38,434
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the Rock Band charity night.

1583
01:43:38,474 --> 01:43:42,355
[SPEAKER_03]: You play Rock Band on stage, and you pay money to do it, but it's this whole charity thing.

1584
01:43:42,375 --> 01:43:42,996
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty awesome.

1585
01:43:43,436 --> 01:43:45,937
[SPEAKER_03]: December 9th, the date has officially been announced this year.

1586
01:43:45,977 --> 01:43:47,897
[SPEAKER_03]: They switched days, if I'm not mistaking.

1587
01:43:47,937 --> 01:43:49,338
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not on the same night of the week.

1588
01:43:49,358 --> 01:43:53,820
[SPEAKER_03]: I think last year it was on a Monday, and this year it's going to be on a Thursday, so it's moving up.

1589
01:43:54,780 --> 01:43:59,702
[SPEAKER_03]: And apparently one of the big things they're doing this year, there's going to be a headliner band that they're going to auction away.

1590
01:44:00,122 --> 01:44:00,783
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty cool.

1591
01:44:00,803 --> 01:44:07,725
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to convince my pal Victoria to do a band where she's going to sing Lady Gaga and we'll call ourselves Victoria and the Gays.

1592
01:44:08,346 --> 01:44:09,786
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really excited about that.

1593
01:44:09,826 --> 01:44:12,908
[SPEAKER_03]: So you might have to come out and watch us rock it at Umlaut.

1594
01:44:12,928 --> 01:44:16,529
[SPEAKER_03]: But they do an internet stream too, which I want to say was very well trafficked last year.

1595
01:44:16,549 --> 01:44:17,830
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can donate to a good cause.

1596
01:44:17,870 --> 01:44:20,091
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all for child's play, etc., etc.

1597
01:44:20,151 --> 01:44:22,812
[SPEAKER_03]: I will make sure Say gets on the show to talk about this at some point.

1598
01:44:24,092 --> 01:44:25,533
[SPEAKER_03]: If he doesn't come on, I will be sad.

1599
01:44:26,494 --> 01:44:28,275
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on, let's get to some Twitter topics.

1600
01:44:28,976 --> 01:44:29,596
[SPEAKER_03]: Some tweets.

1601
01:44:30,336 --> 01:44:30,917
[SPEAKER_03]: The Twitters.

1602
01:44:32,858 --> 01:44:34,159
[SPEAKER_03]: Twitter.com slash OLR.

1603
01:44:34,179 --> 01:44:36,901
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to send us some tweets.

1604
01:44:38,622 --> 01:44:40,543
[SPEAKER_03]: Oops, and I just closed them because I'm a genius.

1605
01:44:41,724 --> 01:44:42,885
[SPEAKER_03]: I was on the Twitter page.

1606
01:44:43,789 --> 01:44:48,151
[SPEAKER_03]: and my fat finger clicked the button and I moved to a new page and now Twitter is giving me the fail whale.

1607
01:44:48,171 --> 01:44:48,772
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.

1608
01:44:49,352 --> 01:44:50,272
[SPEAKER_03]: No more Twitter topics.

1609
01:44:50,312 --> 01:44:50,793
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, here we go.

1610
01:44:51,473 --> 01:44:58,897
[SPEAKER_03]: SBHale is asking, was going to ask what you guys thought about the Sony Move, but Rob's TwitPic already answered my question.

1611
01:44:59,137 --> 01:45:03,579
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't post a picture of me holding the Move controllers in a provocative manner or anything.

1612
01:45:03,899 --> 01:45:07,901
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let me rephrase the question then for Loki because he already talked about the Sony Move earlier in the show.

1613
01:45:08,361 --> 01:45:11,503
[SPEAKER_03]: If you could sum up the Sony Move in three words, Loki, what would they be?

1614
01:45:13,911 --> 01:45:14,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like Nintendo.

1615
01:45:16,732 --> 01:45:16,972
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

1616
01:45:19,052 --> 01:45:19,412
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

1617
01:45:19,492 --> 01:45:21,293
[SPEAKER_03]: Tiger Claw is giving us some links tonight.

1618
01:45:22,113 --> 01:45:26,114
[SPEAKER_03]: Steam is launching a beta for the Steam Wallet payment option.

1619
01:45:27,374 --> 01:45:29,615
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, this is something they're beta testing right now.

1620
01:45:29,855 --> 01:45:33,296
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead of using a debit or credit card, you can actually...

1621
01:45:34,116 --> 01:45:38,919
[SPEAKER_03]: Use money out of your card and put it in a Steam wallet and then use the money to buy the game.

1622
01:45:39,620 --> 01:45:42,882
[SPEAKER_03]: Not sure how this works or why this is practical.

1623
01:45:43,202 --> 01:45:52,187
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm assuming it's some type of like middle thing where your parents, like when you're good, will put like $25 in your Steam wallet and then you as the child can spend that on whatever.

1624
01:45:52,487 --> 01:45:53,608
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm thinking that's what this is.

1625
01:45:53,668 --> 01:45:55,349
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of like a fancy gift certificate, eh?

1626
01:45:55,930 --> 01:45:58,431
[SPEAKER_03]: That's coming out to Steam, I guess very soon.

1627
01:45:58,471 --> 01:45:59,712
[SPEAKER_03]: It's being beta tested right now.

1628
01:46:02,179 --> 01:46:05,660
[SPEAKER_03]: Also from Tiger Claw, because I'm nice and allowing two tweets tonight.

1629
01:46:06,640 --> 01:46:10,721
[SPEAKER_03]: The Xbox Live murderer was sentenced to two life sentences.

1630
01:46:10,901 --> 01:46:14,081
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, the sad thing is I look at this and I go, which Xbox Live murderer?

1631
01:46:14,121 --> 01:46:15,762
[SPEAKER_03]: Because unfortunately there's been a lot of them.

1632
01:46:17,122 --> 01:46:21,003
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, a jury convicted, let's see, what's the name of the asshole in this case?

1633
01:46:21,023 --> 01:46:24,523
[SPEAKER_03]: 23-year-old Derek Lee Hernandez.

1634
01:46:24,963 --> 01:46:26,604
[SPEAKER_03]: Two mandatory life sentences.

1635
01:46:26,684 --> 01:46:28,164
[SPEAKER_03]: Congratulations, no parole.

1636
01:46:30,361 --> 01:46:38,567
[SPEAKER_03]: He killed 22-year-old Jason Hawley, and it was a jury of six men and six women who deliberated over two days, found him guilty.

1637
01:46:39,007 --> 01:46:41,009
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, man.

1638
01:46:41,309 --> 01:46:43,570
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not even going to go into the gritty details about this.

1639
01:46:44,291 --> 01:46:47,293
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, this was the guy he was mentally challenged.

1640
01:46:48,153 --> 01:47:16,771
[SPEAKER_03]: and uh the guy kind of took advantage of him remember this this was the judge the judge had said during the trial he wanted to be your friend Mr. Hernandez he would have done whatever you asked him and you took advantage of that you tricked him into coming up to the mountains and there was no other reason than to take his life and yeah it was all this whole like uh that he uh took the 360 from the poor guy it's messed up but it really has nothing to do with games again I hate these like senseless murder things

1641
01:47:17,355 --> 01:47:20,437
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, moving on, moving on, moving on.

1642
01:47:21,158 --> 01:47:23,760
[SPEAKER_03]: Blue Swim sending us a tweet.

1643
01:47:25,321 --> 01:47:29,804
[SPEAKER_03]: What are your biggest gaming surprises and disappointments of the current console generation?

1644
01:47:29,864 --> 01:47:31,345
[SPEAKER_03]: Great job on the marathon show.

1645
01:47:31,546 --> 01:47:31,886
[SPEAKER_03]: Loved it.

1646
01:47:32,366 --> 01:47:36,009
[SPEAKER_03]: Biggest gaming surprises and disappointments of the current console generation from Blue Swim.

1647
01:47:37,429 --> 01:47:37,729
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyone?

1648
01:47:38,249 --> 01:47:42,131
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say biggest surprise would be LittleBigPlanet in a way.

1649
01:47:42,311 --> 01:47:44,052
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't think I'd like that as much as I did.

1650
01:47:45,132 --> 01:47:55,537
[SPEAKER_03]: Biggest disappointment is probably the Xbox Live game shows, 1 versus 100, going away so quickly and without replacement.

1651
01:47:57,297 --> 01:47:57,577
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyone?

1652
01:47:57,597 --> 01:47:59,198
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1653
01:48:04,304 --> 01:48:07,465
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't really have any major surprises or anything.

1654
01:48:07,505 --> 01:48:10,306
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, LittleBigPlanet, I kind of expected it to do big.

1655
01:48:11,347 --> 01:48:15,908
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess I'm kind of surprised about Final Fantasy XIV sucking so bad.

1656
01:48:16,949 --> 01:48:18,289
[SPEAKER_08]: So I guess that's a disappointment.

1657
01:48:19,510 --> 01:48:20,090
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, anything?

1658
01:48:21,108 --> 01:48:22,909
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, let's see.

1659
01:48:23,329 --> 01:48:31,373
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say disappointing would be Nintendo and them grasping online because they really haven't.

1660
01:48:31,473 --> 01:48:33,774
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know that they have stuff in their store.

1661
01:48:33,794 --> 01:48:42,278
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, I think the question is we should be posing is when's the last time that we've actually had a virtual console release from them?

1662
01:48:43,943 --> 01:48:45,684
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, oh, I know disappointment.

1663
01:48:45,904 --> 01:48:46,845
[SPEAKER_03]: I know the biggest disappointment.

1664
01:48:46,885 --> 01:48:47,845
[SPEAKER_03]: PlayStation Home.

1665
01:48:48,786 --> 01:48:49,786
[SPEAKER_03]: So much potential.

1666
01:48:50,347 --> 01:48:51,307
[SPEAKER_03]: Just down the toilet.

1667
01:48:51,767 --> 01:49:02,793
[SPEAKER_04]: And to bounce off of that, I would have to say probably, was it Microsoft's wonderful arcade thing?

1668
01:49:02,893 --> 01:49:03,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Game Room.

1669
01:49:03,454 --> 01:49:08,136
[SPEAKER_04]: Game Room, yeah.

1670
01:49:08,336 --> 01:49:11,458
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft in chat says the greatest surprise was Earth Defense Force.

1671
01:49:12,870 --> 01:49:15,511
[SPEAKER_03]: which, funny enough, leads into Blue Swim's other tweets.

1672
01:49:16,211 --> 01:49:18,732
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki might recognize where Blue Swim's from in a minute here.

1673
01:49:19,032 --> 01:49:25,654
[SPEAKER_03]: He says, also, if I got Loki or OLR in hot water with D3 Publisher for the EDF story on CheapAssGamer, I apologize.

1674
01:49:27,014 --> 01:49:30,795
[SPEAKER_03]: Just wanted to share the EDF news and hopefully send some new listeners OLR's way in the process.

1675
01:49:30,855 --> 01:49:31,015
[SPEAKER_03]: Nah.

1676
01:49:31,215 --> 01:49:32,337
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you didn't hear anything.

1677
01:49:32,497 --> 01:49:37,123
[SPEAKER_04]: And you didn't send any listeners our way because no one realized that, you know, it was from Orange on the Red.

1678
01:49:37,143 --> 01:49:38,846
[SPEAKER_03]: But your blog got a lot of hits.

1679
01:49:38,926 --> 01:49:41,189
[SPEAKER_03]: It was CheapAssGamer was the source of that story.

1680
01:49:41,209 --> 01:49:43,833
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because clearly they talked about it on their show.

1681
01:49:47,190 --> 01:49:49,592
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we don't blame you, Blue Swim.

1682
01:49:49,692 --> 01:49:50,152
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I know.

1683
01:49:50,192 --> 01:49:53,195
[SPEAKER_03]: You're just excited like Loki is about the game.

1684
01:49:54,096 --> 01:49:57,198
[SPEAKER_04]: I did add a little something, though.

1685
01:49:58,119 --> 01:49:59,140
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not just 360 this time.

1686
01:49:59,900 --> 01:50:00,160
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh!

1687
01:50:01,161 --> 01:50:03,723
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1688
01:50:03,803 --> 01:50:04,404
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

1689
01:50:05,044 --> 01:50:09,168
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkKisuke sends us a tweet saying you guys should play Dead Space for a show.

1690
01:50:09,308 --> 01:50:10,469
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe the next marathon show.

1691
01:50:10,509 --> 01:50:13,191
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't usually play a lot of games on air while we're trying to do the show.

1692
01:50:13,251 --> 01:50:14,192
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little bit distracting.

1693
01:50:15,232 --> 01:50:15,733
Ha ha ha!

1694
01:50:16,528 --> 01:50:17,248
[SPEAKER_03]: Redertainment.

1695
01:50:17,488 --> 01:50:20,589
[SPEAKER_03]: This question might be inappropriate, so ready the inappropriate alarm.

1696
01:50:20,829 --> 01:50:22,949
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, could you ready the inappropriate alarm?

1697
01:50:23,730 --> 01:50:23,990
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1698
01:50:24,430 --> 01:50:25,630
[SPEAKER_03]: Because this question's for you.

1699
01:50:25,830 --> 01:50:27,050
[SPEAKER_03]: There's the inappropriate alarm.

1700
01:50:27,791 --> 01:50:31,791
[SPEAKER_03]: Does DarkSakura have a vibrator to compare the PS3 dildo sticks to?

1701
01:50:38,653 --> 01:50:38,813
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1702
01:50:38,833 --> 01:50:38,873
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1703
01:50:40,735 --> 01:50:43,698
[SPEAKER_08]: I had to think about it.

1704
01:50:43,758 --> 01:50:45,420
[SPEAKER_03]: Her vibrators are uncomparable.

1705
01:50:48,840 --> 01:50:49,900
[SPEAKER_08]: No, mine aren't USB.

1706
01:50:50,361 --> 01:50:51,601
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

1707
01:50:51,661 --> 01:50:53,142
[SPEAKER_03]: Spazinator PSN.

1708
01:50:53,922 --> 01:50:55,003
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, this is a good question.

1709
01:50:55,083 --> 01:50:56,023
[SPEAKER_03]: I totally forgot about this one.

1710
01:50:56,063 --> 01:50:56,643
[SPEAKER_03]: Sends us a tweet.

1711
01:50:57,043 --> 01:51:03,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Feel like touching on the whole temporary banning from Xbox Live because some guy lived in Fort Gay, West Virginia.

1712
01:51:04,346 --> 01:51:05,747
[SPEAKER_03]: Please tell me you guys heard about this.

1713
01:51:05,827 --> 01:51:09,128
[SPEAKER_03]: The guy put in his bio that he lived in Fort Gay, West Virginia.

1714
01:51:09,509 --> 01:51:11,870
[SPEAKER_03]: He got banned from Xbox Live.

1715
01:51:12,030 --> 01:51:16,832
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought, though, that they were stopping... They weren't banning people from that stuff nowadays.

1716
01:51:18,192 --> 01:51:25,858
[SPEAKER_03]: I think when it was looked at, some people thought that he was calling West Virginia gay or something.

1717
01:51:25,998 --> 01:51:26,558
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1718
01:51:26,758 --> 01:51:30,061
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not gay, it's Fort Gay, okay?

1719
01:51:30,421 --> 01:51:33,563
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a maximum security gay facility.

1720
01:51:33,583 --> 01:51:39,607
[SPEAKER_03]: Which coincidentally is going to be the name of the OLR fort that DarkSakura is going to take over someday will be Fort Gay.

1721
01:51:39,708 --> 01:51:40,308
[SPEAKER_08]: Fort Gay!

1722
01:51:42,470 --> 01:51:42,650
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1723
01:51:42,671 --> 01:51:43,572
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it means happy.

1724
01:51:43,873 --> 01:51:44,413
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, it does.

1725
01:51:44,433 --> 01:51:44,854
[SPEAKER_08]: It does.

1726
01:51:44,934 --> 01:51:45,756
[SPEAKER_08]: And we'll paint it rainbow.

1727
01:51:46,417 --> 01:51:47,559
[SPEAKER_08]: Because everyone loves a rainbow.

1728
01:51:47,639 --> 01:51:48,059
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

1729
01:51:48,080 --> 01:51:49,402
[SPEAKER_08]: Especially a double rainbow.

1730
01:51:50,023 --> 01:51:50,864
[SPEAKER_03]: What does it mean?

1731
01:51:50,884 --> 01:51:54,210
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought like the fortress of sodomy would...

1732
01:51:56,185 --> 01:51:56,826
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's next door.

1733
01:51:57,326 --> 01:51:58,467
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1734
01:51:58,507 --> 01:52:02,731
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, obviously they're wearing egg on their face over the whole thing.

1735
01:52:03,812 --> 01:52:17,824
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an excellent case of the corporate web and how the corporate web allowed that thing to spiral way out of control because there were rules that were set and this guy is saying, hey, I live there.

1736
01:52:18,044 --> 01:52:18,644
[SPEAKER_03]: Google it.

1737
01:52:18,785 --> 01:52:19,865
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a real place.

1738
01:52:20,919 --> 01:52:43,950
[SPEAKER_03]: for you and me that's where it should have ended but unfortunately thanks to corporate webs it didn't end there and caused a nightmare so now Microsoft is going to have to look at their corporate policy to make sure this kind of dumb shit doesn't happen again and Tiger Claw is saying that Microsoft better be careful because there's actually someone who lives in fucking Australia

1739
01:52:44,983 --> 01:52:49,386
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought there was a fucking France or something too.

1740
01:52:49,426 --> 01:52:51,087
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's another town called fucking.

1741
01:52:52,347 --> 01:52:53,188
[SPEAKER_03]: Fucking Australia.

1742
01:52:53,268 --> 01:52:54,909
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh no, it's Austria, not Australia.

1743
01:52:54,929 --> 01:52:56,210
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I get when I read too fast.

1744
01:52:56,910 --> 01:52:57,911
[SPEAKER_03]: Fucking Austria.

1745
01:52:59,311 --> 01:53:00,132
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, Australia.

1746
01:53:00,152 --> 01:53:01,293
[SPEAKER_03]: Greatest town ever.

1747
01:53:02,673 --> 01:53:05,995
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I say when I realize Arnold Schwarzenegger really is the governor.

1748
01:53:06,135 --> 01:53:06,936
[SPEAKER_03]: Fucking Austria.

1749
01:53:07,156 --> 01:53:08,497
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

1750
01:53:10,178 --> 01:53:11,659
[SPEAKER_03]: Alpha Cananogram is sending us a tweet.

1751
01:53:11,719 --> 01:53:13,540
[SPEAKER_03]: Choo Choo Rocket is coming back.

1752
01:53:14,380 --> 01:53:15,101
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of cool.

1753
01:53:15,901 --> 01:53:18,724
[SPEAKER_03]: Choo Choo Rocket is on its way out on the iPhone.

1754
01:53:18,904 --> 01:53:20,286
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be out in October.

1755
01:53:20,446 --> 01:53:23,969
[SPEAKER_03]: It might be coming to Xbox Live and PlayStation Network.

1756
01:53:24,910 --> 01:53:25,891
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't know, but it might be.

1757
01:53:26,812 --> 01:53:29,174
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently it needs enough support on Facebook.

1758
01:53:29,814 --> 01:53:31,316
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a big Facebook trend thing.

1759
01:53:32,136 --> 01:53:32,757
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, let's see.

1760
01:53:32,897 --> 01:53:37,759
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Ranma S, Appeals Court ruling threatens used software sales.

1761
01:53:37,959 --> 01:53:38,279
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh-oh.

1762
01:53:38,880 --> 01:53:39,620
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't be good.

1763
01:53:40,180 --> 01:53:42,462
[SPEAKER_03]: He sends us a link here to this news.

1764
01:53:42,542 --> 01:53:42,982
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

1765
01:53:43,882 --> 01:53:51,646
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, a federal appeals court has sided with the computer software industry in its effort to squelch sales of second-hand programs covered by widely used licensing agreements.

1766
01:53:52,487 --> 01:53:52,587
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

1767
01:53:54,065 --> 01:53:54,866
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, I'm looking here.

1768
01:53:55,046 --> 01:53:57,368
[SPEAKER_03]: A doctrine refers to a 102-year-old decision by the U.S.

1769
01:53:57,388 --> 01:54:05,894
[SPEAKER_03]: Supreme Court that determined copyright holders can't prevent a buyer from reselling or renting a product after an initial sale as long as additional copies aren't made.

1770
01:54:07,475 --> 01:54:17,863
[SPEAKER_03]: A three-judge panel in the 9th District concluded that first sale doctrine didn't apply to used software programs that online merchant Timothy Verner peddled in his store on eBay.

1771
01:54:17,963 --> 01:54:19,564
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, this might not be good.

1772
01:54:21,687 --> 01:54:23,007
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to read up more on this later.

1773
01:54:23,027 --> 01:54:24,528
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't seen this covered on a lot of sites.

1774
01:54:24,628 --> 01:54:27,969
[SPEAKER_03]: We deal with the first sale doctrine all the time.

1775
01:54:27,989 --> 01:54:30,510
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see what the legal mumbo jumbo is that comes of this.

1776
01:54:30,530 --> 01:54:33,711
[SPEAKER_03]: This is just like the first of many things.

1777
01:54:34,571 --> 01:54:34,831
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1778
01:54:36,431 --> 01:54:43,714
[SPEAKER_03]: And SSJ100Man on Twitter is saying, Comedy site Zug.com pulled a real-life Lemmings prank in downtown Boston.

1779
01:54:43,794 --> 01:54:45,014
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, this has got to be interesting.

1780
01:54:45,074 --> 01:54:46,354
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this like a little video or something?

1781
01:54:47,335 --> 01:54:51,256
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, they actually dressed up in what looks like blue snuggies and green wigs.

1782
01:54:53,086 --> 01:54:55,368
[SPEAKER_03]: This is like one of those stupid flash mob things.

1783
01:54:55,408 --> 01:54:56,509
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking at the thing on YouTube.

1784
01:54:57,489 --> 01:54:58,530
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, so there they go.

1785
01:54:59,411 --> 01:55:01,252
[SPEAKER_03]: They're walking into the water and falling in.

1786
01:55:03,914 --> 01:55:05,816
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the dumbest thing I've ever seen in my life.

1787
01:55:05,836 --> 01:55:06,897
[SPEAKER_03]: People are dumb.

1788
01:55:09,199 --> 01:55:12,001
[SPEAKER_03]: I love how there's all these college kids in the back that don't even care.

1789
01:55:16,405 --> 01:55:17,726
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people have too much time on their hands.

1790
01:55:17,766 --> 01:55:18,506
[SPEAKER_03]: But I love the look.

1791
01:55:18,546 --> 01:55:20,247
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the Snuggies' outfits.

1792
01:55:20,808 --> 01:55:27,291
[SPEAKER_03]: And lastly, Maren Marvel on Twitter is saying, I'm totally guest hosting on OLR on October 1st when Sky is out of town.

1793
01:55:28,192 --> 01:55:28,572
[SPEAKER_03]: You should.

1794
01:55:28,592 --> 01:55:29,412
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd be fun.

1795
01:55:29,512 --> 01:55:31,013
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, you shouldn't.

1796
01:55:31,033 --> 01:55:32,274
[SPEAKER_03]: You should come to Disneyland with me.

1797
01:55:32,334 --> 01:55:33,755
[SPEAKER_03]: You know Disneyland is better than this show.

1798
01:55:33,855 --> 01:55:34,135
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

1799
01:55:34,235 --> 01:55:35,256
[SPEAKER_03]: Just saying.

1800
01:55:35,736 --> 01:55:36,116
[SPEAKER_07]: Just saying.

1801
01:55:37,057 --> 01:55:38,397
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it for the tweeters tonight.

1802
01:55:38,437 --> 01:55:41,439
[SPEAKER_03]: Twitter.com slash OLR.

1803
01:55:41,979 --> 01:55:42,740
[SPEAKER_03]: Back to gaming news.

1804
01:55:42,800 --> 01:55:43,000
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki.

1805
01:55:44,431 --> 01:55:54,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, so speaking of tweets, this is retarded, but I guess the natural progression of stuff.

1806
01:55:55,479 --> 01:56:05,265
[SPEAKER_04]: Guitar Hero Warriors Rock will be the first Guitar Hero game, and I can't say this with any less enthusiasm, to integrate Twitter and Facebook.

1807
01:56:05,505 --> 01:56:06,406
[SPEAKER_04]: Hurrah!

1808
01:56:07,247 --> 01:56:11,109
[SPEAKER_04]: Now everybody can know when you do stuff in this game.

1809
01:56:11,970 --> 01:56:13,711
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I give a shit.

1810
01:56:14,792 --> 01:56:17,034
[SPEAKER_04]: But, yes, it will be coming.

1811
01:56:17,054 --> 01:56:18,135
[SPEAKER_04]: It is confirmed on the Wii.

1812
01:56:18,295 --> 01:56:25,461
[SPEAKER_04]: I can tell you right now, based off the presentation that was given to me by the Activision reps, it is also coming to the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360.

1813
01:56:25,762 --> 01:56:27,203
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a big surprise.

1814
01:56:30,333 --> 01:56:31,113
[SPEAKER_04]: Now my Steam is working.

1815
01:56:31,133 --> 01:56:31,173
[SPEAKER_04]: So.

1816
01:56:52,472 --> 01:56:52,872
[SPEAKER_04]: Hooray!

1817
01:56:53,213 --> 01:56:54,073
[SPEAKER_04]: And guess what, though?

1818
01:56:54,093 --> 01:57:00,018
[SPEAKER_04]: At least, you know, well, you already know this, but I mean, if you buy a guitar early, you get a CD.

1819
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:03,962
[SPEAKER_03]: Of, like, actual songs that are included in the game?

1820
01:57:03,982 --> 01:57:04,923
[SPEAKER_03]: Soundgarden's new album.

1821
01:57:05,343 --> 01:57:07,264
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, interesting tactic.

1822
01:57:07,625 --> 01:57:09,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, if you like Soundgarden, I guess.

1823
01:57:10,587 --> 01:57:13,149
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'll be blocking that on Facebook pretty quickly, no offense.

1824
01:57:13,410 --> 01:57:14,751
[SPEAKER_03]: Just, you know, not really my thing.

1825
01:57:15,731 --> 01:57:33,619
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, but there's more details on Rock Band 3 I'm excited about this No Twitter or Facebook integration here Actually, they are confirming that you will be able to export Rock Band 2 tracks for a fee The export feature will work on all three consoles Of course, there's always a couple songs that get a little weird

1826
01:57:34,059 --> 01:58:02,094
[SPEAKER_03]: so you can imagine that a couple songs are going to fall off the list unfortunately but most of them should come over for a small fee that's really cool regular download content will remain the regular price that's $2 per song but they are saying that for Rock Band 3's pro mode the songs will probably be more expensive because there's more work that has to be done on these tracks and they don't want to increase the cost of regular download content to subsidize the pro download content that's aimed at a smaller group of players

1827
01:58:02,954 --> 01:58:31,421
[SPEAKER_03]: usually I'd be a little worried about this but I go you know what I feel like Harmonix kind of does the download content better than almost anyone right now so I'm like okay I trust them like I don't know how you guys feel but I'm just kind of like okay if that's what they say I trust them they get it I'm like they get it they've proved that they understand download content for a very long time this export feature's great you know yeah it's a fee but it's I understand it's out of their hands and it's licensing at least they bothered to do it at all I kind of go okay they know what they're doing if that's what they say then I agree

1828
01:58:34,332 --> 01:59:00,183
[SPEAKER_04]: plus it also makes sense that the rock band stuff would cost a little more in the pro mode because there's probably less people buying them too you know yeah I mean you have to have the pro mode instruments and stuff like that which are really expensive well at least on the guitar it's really expensive but the keyboard's not so much I don't know I wouldn't want to pay extra for that stuff but if you really want to there's a market for it

1829
01:59:01,744 --> 01:59:09,511
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm interested in the promo stuff, especially for keyboards, because once you learn how to play the song on the keyboard, you could actually go to a piano or whatever and play it.

1830
01:59:09,551 --> 01:59:11,392
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's awesome, if you can memorize it.

1831
01:59:11,873 --> 01:59:14,235
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm looking forward to trying that out.

1832
01:59:14,255 --> 01:59:15,116
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to be very cool.

1833
01:59:15,996 --> 01:59:19,580
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to go over to DarkSakura, who's got another story for us here.

1834
01:59:20,460 --> 01:59:21,001
[SPEAKER_03]: I sure do.

1835
01:59:21,141 --> 01:59:25,525
[SPEAKER_03]: Coming up very soon, the mailbag at mailbag at orangeonline.com, the FU's of the week, and your calls.

1836
01:59:27,040 --> 01:59:30,981
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we've got a new challenger in for Marvel vs. Capcom 3.

1837
01:59:32,302 --> 01:59:35,783
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is pretty, pretty sweet.

1838
01:59:35,823 --> 01:59:36,983
[SPEAKER_08]: But we're getting Tron Bon.

1839
01:59:37,203 --> 01:59:38,083
[SPEAKER_08]: That's so cool.

1840
01:59:39,264 --> 01:59:41,324
[SPEAKER_08]: She's kind of on crack.

1841
01:59:42,124 --> 01:59:44,785
[SPEAKER_03]: She's kind of been in a lot of the fighting games, right?

1842
01:59:44,805 --> 01:59:46,606
[SPEAKER_03]: Give us a new Mega Man Legends already!

1843
01:59:46,986 --> 01:59:47,626
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate you!

1844
01:59:47,646 --> 01:59:52,447
[SPEAKER_08]: The little Servbots have been in the background on Tatsunoko vs. Capcom.

1845
01:59:52,848 --> 01:59:53,588
[SPEAKER_08]: They're so cute.

1846
01:59:53,648 --> 01:59:54,428
[SPEAKER_08]: They look like Lego men.

1847
01:59:55,874 --> 01:59:56,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I agree, though.

1848
01:59:56,695 --> 01:59:57,836
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's Mega Man Legends?

1849
01:59:58,056 --> 02:00:01,859
[SPEAKER_04]: There is coming, but it's just going to take forever.

1850
02:00:02,160 --> 02:00:04,201
[SPEAKER_03]: I would buy that on PS1 Classics if I could.

1851
02:00:04,261 --> 02:00:04,922
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that available?

1852
02:00:04,962 --> 02:00:05,543
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it is.

1853
02:00:06,003 --> 02:00:06,163
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1854
02:00:06,183 --> 02:00:07,064
[SPEAKER_03]: For PS1 Classics?

1855
02:00:08,891 --> 02:00:09,972
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn you, Capcom.

1856
02:00:10,733 --> 02:00:13,235
[SPEAKER_03]: Just when you're doing so many things right, there's that one thing.

1857
02:00:13,515 --> 02:00:13,995
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, though.

1858
02:00:14,075 --> 02:00:14,476
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing.

1859
02:00:14,556 --> 02:00:14,796
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob.

1860
02:00:15,016 --> 02:00:15,977
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1861
02:00:16,838 --> 02:00:25,385
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, with if let's say that the homebrew scene or pirating scene, however you want to call it, gets to where it is on the PSP.

1862
02:00:25,965 --> 02:00:34,487
[SPEAKER_04]: They have ways to convert PS1 ISO files into a playable format on the PlayStation emulator that's on the PSP.

1863
02:00:35,048 --> 02:00:37,688
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can port Mega Man Legends or something like that.

1864
02:00:37,808 --> 02:00:41,189
[SPEAKER_04]: So if they can do it for the PSP, they may be able to do it for the PS3.

1865
02:00:42,190 --> 02:00:42,670
[SPEAKER_04]: Very nice.

1866
02:00:42,950 --> 02:00:43,170
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1867
02:00:43,430 --> 02:00:46,411
[SPEAKER_03]: Or I could just find the PS1 disc somewhere and play it in my PS3.

1868
02:00:46,531 --> 02:00:48,771
[SPEAKER_03]: I imagine it's not that hard to find.

1869
02:00:50,232 --> 02:00:50,912
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they're not.

1870
02:00:52,614 --> 02:00:56,515
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember the game being particularly rare, I could be wrong, but yeah.

1871
02:00:58,076 --> 02:00:59,796
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, speaking of Mega Man, Loki, right?

1872
02:01:00,996 --> 02:01:06,638
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, speaking of Mega Man, there's some new details coming out about Mega Man Universe, and it's kind of cool.

1873
02:01:07,258 --> 02:01:15,100
[SPEAKER_04]: The game itself looks a little bit like it could be similar to the Mega Man Powered Up Mega Man, which was on the PSP.

1874
02:01:15,440 --> 02:01:17,181
[SPEAKER_04]: It does include a level editor...

1875
02:01:17,901 --> 02:01:19,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's awesome.

1876
02:01:19,863 --> 02:01:25,306
[SPEAKER_04]: That you'll be able to share, of course, with your friends, different levels that you've made.

1877
02:01:25,666 --> 02:01:26,907
[SPEAKER_04]: It's LittleBigMegaMan.

1878
02:01:28,468 --> 02:01:30,309
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't that what this game is turning into, LittleBigMegaMan?

1879
02:01:30,409 --> 02:01:32,170
[SPEAKER_04]: It seriously is getting pretty awesome.

1880
02:01:32,430 --> 02:01:36,893
[SPEAKER_04]: And they had some other screenshots that showed different playable characters.

1881
02:01:36,933 --> 02:01:40,775
[SPEAKER_04]: They had a screenshot that actually showed the box art Mega Man playing...

1882
02:01:42,336 --> 02:01:50,218
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, you can create new Mega Man characters by mixing and matching different parts, like different heads and whatnot.

1883
02:01:51,999 --> 02:01:52,899
[SPEAKER_04]: Really cool stuff.

1884
02:01:53,059 --> 02:02:01,382
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, I guess they're saying that, of course, there's going to be the Ryu Mega Man that's in there, probably the Ghosts and Goblins Mega Man.

1885
02:02:01,402 --> 02:02:01,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1886
02:02:04,695 --> 02:02:05,195
[SPEAKER_04]: Mega Man.

1887
02:02:05,615 --> 02:02:06,376
[SPEAKER_04]: Mega Man, yes.

1888
02:02:07,176 --> 02:02:12,737
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, in fact, here's the screenshot there of the box art one, which looks so ugly.

1889
02:02:12,977 --> 02:02:16,218
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know this isn't the first time that Mega Man's had Street Fighter moves.

1890
02:02:17,018 --> 02:02:22,040
[SPEAKER_08]: Because remember in X and X2, he could get the Hadouken and Shoryuken.

1891
02:02:22,600 --> 02:02:25,100
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right, I vaguely recall that right.

1892
02:02:25,601 --> 02:02:26,301
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, which I could do.

1893
02:02:26,721 --> 02:02:27,061
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool.

1894
02:02:28,636 --> 02:02:39,412
[SPEAKER_04]: The game itself, though, I'm kind of rusty when it comes to identifying my Mega Man stages, but I'm wondering if it's going to have more than just it looks like Mega Man

1895
02:02:40,633 --> 02:02:41,694
[SPEAKER_04]: 2 characters.

1896
02:02:42,214 --> 02:02:44,456
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks very Mega Man 2 inspired, doesn't it?

1897
02:02:44,756 --> 02:02:46,237
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm wondering if it's going to have more than that.

1898
02:02:46,317 --> 02:02:47,058
[SPEAKER_04]: That might be cool.

1899
02:02:47,398 --> 02:02:50,260
[SPEAKER_03]: Alpha Cananagram in the chat is quick to correct me on things.

1900
02:02:50,340 --> 02:02:55,003
[SPEAKER_03]: He says, Mega Man powered up with the level editor came out two years before Little Big Planet.

1901
02:02:55,844 --> 02:02:57,725
[SPEAKER_03]: True enough, I suppose, but I don't know.

1902
02:02:57,765 --> 02:03:01,027
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of feel like Little Big Planet is what really made the splash.

1903
02:03:01,067 --> 02:03:01,568
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?

1904
02:03:01,608 --> 02:03:01,968
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1905
02:03:02,528 --> 02:03:02,729
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1906
02:03:03,469 --> 02:03:04,370
[SPEAKER_03]: But, okay, sure.

1907
02:03:04,430 --> 02:03:07,652
[SPEAKER_03]: So this idea is, you know, not entirely new for the Mega Man series.

1908
02:03:07,692 --> 02:03:08,092
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fine.

1909
02:03:08,733 --> 02:03:08,933
[SPEAKER_09]: Mm-hmm.

1910
02:03:10,706 --> 02:03:12,167
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I know I'm interested in the game.

1911
02:03:12,227 --> 02:03:12,747
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to buy it.

1912
02:03:12,807 --> 02:03:14,348
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it arcade or is it retail?

1913
02:03:14,388 --> 02:03:14,908
[SPEAKER_03]: Have they said?

1914
02:03:15,268 --> 02:03:15,588
[SPEAKER_03]: Arcade.

1915
02:03:16,048 --> 02:03:16,489
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, man.

1916
02:03:16,509 --> 02:03:17,969
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to be a heck of an arcade game.

1917
02:03:19,170 --> 02:03:21,571
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully it's not more than $20, but watch them be charging like $30.

1918
02:03:24,092 --> 02:03:27,173
[SPEAKER_03]: If there's going to be a game that's going to break the price barrier yet again, it'll be this.

1919
02:03:27,513 --> 02:03:27,814
[SPEAKER_03]: Watch.

1920
02:03:29,774 --> 02:03:30,255
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see, though.

1921
02:03:30,295 --> 02:03:30,855
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully not.

1922
02:03:32,483 --> 02:03:37,085
[SPEAKER_03]: If they do try to break the barrier, it might leave Valve to talk even more smack about Xbox Live.

1923
02:03:37,165 --> 02:03:37,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you haven't heard.

1924
02:03:37,866 --> 02:03:41,267
[SPEAKER_03]: Valve has apparently talked some smack about Xbox Live.

1925
02:03:41,648 --> 02:03:46,010
[SPEAKER_03]: This is kind of interesting because I seem to recall some time ago it was just the reverse.

1926
02:03:46,050 --> 02:03:52,153
[SPEAKER_03]: They used to dog on PlayStation 3 and they were supporting Xbox Live with exclusives such as Portal Still Alive.

1927
02:03:52,553 --> 02:03:54,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, times have changed a little bit, haven't they?

1928
02:03:55,354 --> 02:03:58,576
[SPEAKER_03]: Gabe Newell has referred to Xbox Live as a train wreck.

1929
02:04:00,080 --> 02:04:04,063
[SPEAKER_03]: We thought that there would be something that would emerge because we figured it was sort of untenable.

1930
02:04:04,743 --> 02:04:09,126
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, we understand that these are the rules now, but it's such a train wreck that something will have to change.

1931
02:04:09,606 --> 02:04:12,067
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why we're really happy with the current situation with the PlayStation 3.

1932
02:04:12,768 --> 02:04:19,652
[SPEAKER_03]: We're solving it now in a way that is going to work for our customers rather than assuming something is going to emerge later that will allow us to fix this.

1933
02:04:20,572 --> 02:04:20,892
[SPEAKER_03]: Yikes.

1934
02:04:21,513 --> 02:04:25,735
[SPEAKER_03]: They're saying that Microsoft has got to change the online policies if they want to compete.

1935
02:04:26,075 --> 02:04:29,698
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I want to say though, not the first person to dog a little bit on Xbox Live.

1936
02:04:30,558 --> 02:04:39,023
[SPEAKER_03]: This kind of reminds me of Square Enix coming out a little bit ago saying that Final Fantasy XIV is not coming out on the Xbox 360 because Xbox Live just ain't going to work.

1937
02:04:41,885 --> 02:04:42,665
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what they're saying.

1938
02:04:43,266 --> 02:04:45,147
[SPEAKER_03]: So, very interesting.

1939
02:04:47,420 --> 02:04:48,040
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, yeah.

1940
02:04:49,681 --> 02:04:52,401
[SPEAKER_03]: It's interesting to me kind of how Valve has come full circle.

1941
02:04:52,761 --> 02:05:04,064
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, and I can see the reasons why to an extent, and certainly again, not the first developer to say bad things about Xbox Live, but it's just very interesting how much things have changed in a few years.

1942
02:05:05,364 --> 02:05:05,784
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

1943
02:05:06,965 --> 02:05:08,365
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get to the mailbag, shall we?

1944
02:05:08,525 --> 02:05:11,646
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, you ready to rip open the email bag and read some emails for us here?

1945
02:05:11,766 --> 02:05:12,746
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm ready to rip something.

1946
02:05:13,066 --> 02:05:13,526
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright. ...

1947
02:05:19,844 --> 02:05:24,328
[SPEAKER_03]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us some emails to be read on the air.

1948
02:05:24,348 --> 02:05:25,088
[SPEAKER_03]: Did we get some emails?

1949
02:05:25,188 --> 02:05:27,230
[SPEAKER_03]: The mailbag was pretty thin going into tonight's show.

1950
02:05:27,250 --> 02:05:27,830
[SPEAKER_03]: Did we get some?

1951
02:05:27,930 --> 02:05:28,471
[SPEAKER_08]: We got a few.

1952
02:05:28,731 --> 02:05:29,131
[SPEAKER_08]: Hooray!

1953
02:05:29,812 --> 02:05:32,154
[SPEAKER_08]: The first one's from AwesomeDude slash Troy.

1954
02:05:35,957 --> 02:05:37,378
[SPEAKER_08]: Now this is the philosophical question.

1955
02:05:37,398 --> 02:05:38,178
[SPEAKER_08]: I gave us some warning.

1956
02:05:39,199 --> 02:05:41,020
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't see why you can't do both.

1957
02:05:41,060 --> 02:05:41,140
[SPEAKER_08]: Jeez.

1958
02:06:10,137 --> 02:06:13,458
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, it's tricky because what's going to prevent me from doing one over the other?

1959
02:06:13,779 --> 02:06:14,299
[SPEAKER_03]: It's strange.

1960
02:06:15,579 --> 02:06:18,661
[SPEAKER_08]: What if by being with somebody you leave your mark on the world?

1961
02:06:19,101 --> 02:06:25,064
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of feel like, okay, this is going to sound really cheesy, but I feel like in a way this show has left the mark on the world a little bit.

1962
02:06:25,544 --> 02:06:31,526
[SPEAKER_03]: Like maybe not in a totally like amazing humanitarian Mother Teresa kind of way.

1963
02:06:32,967 --> 02:06:41,929
[SPEAKER_03]: But just some of the really nice emails that I've got over the years, especially from other guys who sometimes struggle with... Oops, not the FU music yet.

1964
02:06:42,749 --> 02:06:47,470
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes other guys who've struggled with coming out and stuff and saying that hearing me on the show has helped with that.

1965
02:06:47,510 --> 02:06:55,352
[SPEAKER_03]: The power of an email like that is really hard to put into words and how that makes you feel like you've really had an impact.

1966
02:06:55,392 --> 02:06:59,973
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know there's quote-unquote fans of all of us out there, which is such a strange...

1967
02:07:00,473 --> 02:07:02,535
[SPEAKER_03]: Feeling because we're pretty normal people.

1968
02:07:02,575 --> 02:07:07,799
[SPEAKER_03]: We just like video games and figured out how to do this radio thing pretty quickly and have stayed pretty dedicated to it.

1969
02:07:08,719 --> 02:07:10,000
[SPEAKER_03]: That those kind of words have been amazing.

1970
02:07:10,060 --> 02:07:16,925
[SPEAKER_03]: So I kind of feel like in some ways I've already picked the first option because I'm not living with a loved one right now.

1971
02:07:17,326 --> 02:07:18,607
[SPEAKER_03]: The Dark Sakura is doing both.

1972
02:07:19,047 --> 02:07:19,327
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1973
02:07:19,808 --> 02:07:21,629
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's tough because you're asking me to backtrack.

1974
02:07:22,410 --> 02:07:22,790
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1975
02:07:23,709 --> 02:07:25,010
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't see why you can't do both.

1976
02:07:25,770 --> 02:07:28,131
[SPEAKER_08]: They're not mutually exclusive.

1977
02:07:28,511 --> 02:07:35,374
[SPEAKER_03]: Plus, if you live with a loved one, aren't you leaving your mark on the world with that relationship?

1978
02:07:35,634 --> 02:07:37,555
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that sounds weird, but a little bit?

1979
02:07:37,635 --> 02:07:43,057
[SPEAKER_08]: My philosophy is that the best way to change the world and leave your mark is to be an active part of making it better.

1980
02:07:43,878 --> 02:07:44,118
[SPEAKER_07]: Huh.

1981
02:07:45,578 --> 02:07:46,919
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.com

1982
02:08:02,052 --> 02:08:03,894
[SPEAKER_03]: and it doesn't mean... I don't mean like sex.

1983
02:08:04,094 --> 02:08:06,157
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't mean like love, like kissy kissy.

1984
02:08:06,277 --> 02:08:08,199
[SPEAKER_03]: I just mean like there's all different types of love.

1985
02:08:08,239 --> 02:08:09,260
[SPEAKER_03]: There's platonic love.

1986
02:08:09,300 --> 02:08:11,723
[SPEAKER_03]: There's family love, brotherly love.

1987
02:08:12,063 --> 02:08:13,485
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there is romantic love.

1988
02:08:13,525 --> 02:08:15,507
[SPEAKER_03]: There's love for Earth.

1989
02:08:15,587 --> 02:08:20,292
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't mean to sound like a hippie or whatever, but I think that's kind of what a lot of it's about, isn't it?

1990
02:08:20,472 --> 02:08:21,794
[SPEAKER_08]: You've nailed it on the head.

1991
02:08:21,834 --> 02:08:22,034
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean...

1992
02:08:23,235 --> 02:08:32,040
[SPEAKER_08]: and, you know, people get all butthurt over their own political, you know, points of view being, hey, everyone's got to believe what I do.

1993
02:08:33,060 --> 02:08:38,883
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, if everyone was exactly the same, it would be boring and we would stagnate.

1994
02:08:39,063 --> 02:08:41,785
[SPEAKER_08]: It's those differences that put a challenge...

1995
02:08:42,885 --> 02:08:46,911
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, but I am a firm believer that people don't grow without a challenge.

1996
02:08:47,973 --> 02:08:50,196
[SPEAKER_08]: That you have to have that challenge for people to overcome.

1997
02:08:50,476 --> 02:08:53,280
[SPEAKER_08]: And if they don't overcome, those are the people who don't get to do anything in the world.

1998
02:08:53,961 --> 02:08:54,863
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, they're just going to

1999
02:08:57,858 --> 02:09:05,504
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a hard time putting this because some people are content to live their life just being themselves, you know, not doing anything.

2000
02:09:06,244 --> 02:09:15,370
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think that the best way to grow and challenge yourself is to move outside your comfort zone to do something that's going to make it better.

2001
02:09:16,271 --> 02:09:17,912
[SPEAKER_08]: Because nothing changes until you make it change.

2002
02:09:19,813 --> 02:09:21,573
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that has nothing to do with games.

2003
02:09:21,634 --> 02:09:23,474
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a very deep email for this program.

2004
02:09:23,494 --> 02:09:26,575
[SPEAKER_03]: But hey, sorry to dodge your question, but hope you got out of it.

2005
02:09:26,595 --> 02:09:27,435
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki didn't say anything.

2006
02:09:28,735 --> 02:09:28,855
[SPEAKER_04]: Eh.

2007
02:09:31,576 --> 02:09:32,376
[SPEAKER_04]: There, I said something.

2008
02:09:35,017 --> 02:09:35,697
[SPEAKER_08]: Next email.

2009
02:09:36,097 --> 02:09:37,158
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, OLR crew.

2010
02:09:37,218 --> 02:09:39,498
[SPEAKER_08]: This is your friendly neighborhood Mexican, Actdeft.

2011
02:09:40,139 --> 02:09:44,680
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanted to tell you that you did a pretty damn good job with the marathon on Sunday slash Monday.

2012
02:09:45,040 --> 02:09:48,961
[SPEAKER_08]: I wish I could have been there while this was live, but I did catch the podcast.

2013
02:09:52,181 --> 02:09:55,904
[SPEAKER_08]: You about many interesting topics like favorite game and soundtracks.

2014
02:09:56,305 --> 02:09:58,407
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess it's you spoke about many interesting topics.

2015
02:09:58,927 --> 02:10:00,708
[SPEAKER_08]: Like favorite game and soundtracks and other stuff.

2016
02:10:00,748 --> 02:10:05,432
[SPEAKER_08]: Since I wasn't there to participate in the chatroom, I would like to participate to that with this email.

2017
02:10:06,093 --> 02:10:09,916
[SPEAKER_08]: My favorite game and probably my favorite soundtrack of all time is Kirby Superstar.

2018
02:10:10,737 --> 02:10:15,841
[SPEAKER_08]: So many different games to choose from and they're pretty detailed with puzzles and pretty good platforming.

2019
02:10:16,181 --> 02:10:17,422
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft likes Kirby?

2020
02:10:17,462 --> 02:10:18,022
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't say.

2021
02:10:18,102 --> 02:10:18,783
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't know.

2022
02:10:19,023 --> 02:10:19,704
[SPEAKER_03]: I hadn't heard.

2023
02:10:19,904 --> 02:10:20,144
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey.

2024
02:10:20,324 --> 02:10:20,864
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's funny.

2025
02:10:20,944 --> 02:10:21,205
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cool.

2026
02:10:21,225 --> 02:10:22,986
[SPEAKER_08]: And the soundtrack to it is pretty amazing.

2027
02:10:23,086 --> 02:10:28,910
[SPEAKER_08]: And probably since then, it has made me so interested in video music like I am now.

2028
02:10:29,691 --> 02:10:30,591
[SPEAKER_08]: Video game music, sorry.

2029
02:10:31,172 --> 02:10:35,134
[SPEAKER_08]: I would really recommend people getting Kirby Superstar Ultra on the DS.

2030
02:10:35,435 --> 02:10:40,038
[SPEAKER_08]: The extra additions to it make it worthy of any DS game library.

2031
02:10:41,319 --> 02:10:42,920
[SPEAKER_08]: But not as all-happy game-wise.

2032
02:10:44,127 --> 02:10:44,487
[SPEAKER_08]: Excuse me.

2033
02:10:45,347 --> 02:10:46,668
[SPEAKER_08]: You also talked about disappointments.

2034
02:10:46,728 --> 02:10:47,848
[SPEAKER_08]: Mine was Final Fantasy VIII.

2035
02:10:48,668 --> 02:10:51,109
[SPEAKER_08]: Got it for cheap, but I still think I got robbed.

2036
02:10:52,249 --> 02:10:53,170
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, let me finish.

2037
02:10:54,110 --> 02:11:03,853
[SPEAKER_08]: While I don't like Final Fantasy VII either, at least decent in lots of things, Final Fantasy VIII really takes all the good things of the series and burns them to the ground.

2038
02:11:04,253 --> 02:11:05,553
[SPEAKER_08]: The card game is damn awful.

2039
02:11:05,874 --> 02:11:07,214
[SPEAKER_08]: I never played the card game, for the record.

2040
02:11:07,734 --> 02:11:13,476
[SPEAKER_08]: And it doesn't give you a real good incentive to play it, kind of like Blitzball and Final Fantasy X, which I didn't really do either.

2041
02:11:14,176 --> 02:11:17,561
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, but the thing I hate the most about the whole damn game is the story.

2042
02:11:17,702 --> 02:11:18,162
[SPEAKER_08]: It sucks.

2043
02:11:18,323 --> 02:11:18,643
[SPEAKER_08]: Bad.

2044
02:11:18,743 --> 02:11:19,464
[SPEAKER_08]: It's terror bad.

2045
02:11:20,486 --> 02:11:24,432
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't even like Final Fantasy X pretty much for the same things, but I didn't buy it.

2046
02:11:24,812 --> 02:11:29,920
[SPEAKER_08]: And even though the battle system and grid system is kind of cool, Final Fantasy VIII, really, I don't give a crap about that game.

2047
02:11:30,620 --> 02:11:35,284
[SPEAKER_03]: See, he doesn't like it for the wrong reasons, because I think the story was actually its strongest part.

2048
02:11:35,444 --> 02:11:37,445
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the battles that really did it in for me.

2049
02:11:37,806 --> 02:11:42,129
[SPEAKER_03]: But from what I played of the beta, 14 very well might be worse than 8.

2050
02:11:43,010 --> 02:11:44,291
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I don't know yet.

2051
02:11:44,831 --> 02:11:51,757
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I will have to play the retail version at some point to give you my final thoughts, but there may be a new challenger for the worst Final Fantasy game ever.

2052
02:11:52,077 --> 02:11:53,397
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh no, a new challenger has appeared.

2053
02:11:53,557 --> 02:11:53,838
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

2054
02:11:54,718 --> 02:11:55,218
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll let you know.

2055
02:11:55,938 --> 02:11:57,059
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh well, that's all for now.

2056
02:11:57,219 --> 02:12:01,460
[SPEAKER_08]: I will talk about other stuff you talked about next week, but I don't want to send a big ass email.

2057
02:12:01,500 --> 02:12:01,860
[SPEAKER_08]: Too late!

2058
02:12:02,060 --> 02:12:02,400
[SPEAKER_08]: No kidding.

2059
02:12:03,220 --> 02:12:03,941
[SPEAKER_08]: Until next time.

2060
02:12:04,421 --> 02:12:04,741
[SPEAKER_08]: P.S.

2061
02:12:04,921 --> 02:12:07,402
[SPEAKER_08]: I still don't believe that Duke Nukem Forever will get released.

2062
02:12:08,982 --> 02:12:09,442
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see.

2063
02:12:12,983 --> 02:12:16,124
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it will now that it's with the new developer.

2064
02:12:16,845 --> 02:12:18,025
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's what had to happen.

2065
02:12:18,065 --> 02:12:20,326
[SPEAKER_03]: It just needed to be taken by somebody else.

2066
02:12:20,966 --> 02:12:21,586
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll come out now.

2067
02:12:22,153 --> 02:12:23,154
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, next email.

2068
02:12:24,114 --> 02:12:28,897
[SPEAKER_08]: When you guys were young, did you ever play a game that was so horrible but there was something about it that always kept you playing?

2069
02:12:29,437 --> 02:12:31,738
[SPEAKER_08]: One bad game that comes to mind is Banjo-Kazooie.

2070
02:12:31,858 --> 02:12:37,141
[SPEAKER_08]: I spent countless hours sitting in front of my parents' TV screen trying to collect all those little glowing puzzle pieces.

2071
02:12:37,522 --> 02:12:40,824
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanted to punch the TV screen every time the crazy bear and bird spoke.

2072
02:12:41,204 --> 02:12:44,045
[SPEAKER_08]: However, for some unknown reason, I kept playing until I beat it.

2073
02:12:44,345 --> 02:12:46,467
[SPEAKER_08]: Today, I cringe when I hear any song from that game.

2074
02:12:46,527 --> 02:12:47,267
[SPEAKER_08]: What about you guys?

2075
02:12:47,507 --> 02:12:48,688
[SPEAKER_08]: Your fellow girl gamer, Ziba.

2076
02:12:50,785 --> 02:13:02,531
[SPEAKER_03]: Clash at Demon Head totally like it's not that great a game really but totally a guilty pleasure game like I used to love that game and I don't know why as far as like old school 8-bit NES games go

2077
02:13:04,170 --> 02:13:07,911
[SPEAKER_08]: I really can't remember any that I just... There's games that pissed me off that I'd keep playing.

2078
02:13:08,611 --> 02:13:09,772
[SPEAKER_08]: Like Puzzle and Desu.

2079
02:13:09,872 --> 02:13:10,332
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

2080
02:13:10,632 --> 02:13:12,253
[SPEAKER_08]: You remember I covered that on Classic Game?

2081
02:13:13,113 --> 02:13:14,653
[SPEAKER_08]: That game pisses me off so much.

2082
02:13:15,714 --> 02:13:21,395
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's really not even the best game ever, but the challenge is so hard to it.

2083
02:13:22,856 --> 02:13:23,956
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that game pisses me off.

2084
02:13:25,077 --> 02:13:26,117
[SPEAKER_08]: What about you, Loki?

2085
02:13:28,698 --> 02:13:28,858
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

2086
02:13:30,876 --> 02:13:31,837
[SPEAKER_04]: Earth Defense Force.

2087
02:13:33,519 --> 02:13:37,943
[SPEAKER_04]: It gets really challenging, especially when you get on those Inferno levels, man.

2088
02:13:39,564 --> 02:13:41,706
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes it makes me want to hurt somebody.

2089
02:13:42,207 --> 02:13:43,067
[SPEAKER_04]: I just play more of it.

2090
02:13:44,168 --> 02:13:44,749
[SPEAKER_04]: Good call.

2091
02:13:45,791 --> 02:13:46,771
[SPEAKER_08]: Last email.

2092
02:13:47,171 --> 02:13:48,552
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

2093
02:13:49,372 --> 02:13:50,052
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, OLR.

2094
02:13:50,172 --> 02:13:55,194
[SPEAKER_08]: Emailing in on a few things that I wouldn't otherwise contribute via chat, but I know I would forget.

2095
02:13:55,254 --> 02:13:55,914
[SPEAKER_08]: So here it goes.

2096
02:13:56,694 --> 02:14:07,158
[SPEAKER_08]: I know this news is two weeks late, but Sony not only has their dreaded online pass on some sports games, but it's on an awesome PSP FPS called SOCOM Fireteam Bravo 3.

2097
02:14:08,778 --> 02:14:15,106
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, this may be old news, but I've never heard this on the radio.

2098
02:14:15,227 --> 02:14:18,451
[SPEAKER_08]: Any of you heard of a game called Minecraft?

2099
02:14:19,292 --> 02:14:21,435
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't judge on graphics, although you guys probably wouldn't.

2100
02:14:21,895 --> 02:14:26,201
[SPEAKER_08]: My way of describing it would be Awesome Sauce Imagination Orgasm.

2101
02:14:27,302 --> 02:14:34,187
[SPEAKER_08]: You have unlimited boundaries north, south, east, and west and you can go really far up and down and it's only in alpha.

2102
02:14:34,227 --> 02:14:36,168
[SPEAKER_08]: Give it a try and decide whether or not to buy it.

2103
02:14:36,508 --> 02:14:40,791
[SPEAKER_08]: It's only 10 euros or about 13 bucks and it entitles you to play future releases of the game.

2104
02:14:41,151 --> 02:14:45,814
[SPEAKER_08]: And he put the address, it's Minecraft, M-I-N-E-C-R-A-F-T dot net.

2105
02:14:45,834 --> 02:14:47,435
[SPEAKER_03]: Is he a co-producer or writer?

2106
02:14:47,776 --> 02:14:48,116
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

2107
02:14:48,896 --> 02:14:49,337
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think so.

2108
02:14:49,997 --> 02:14:52,359
[SPEAKER_08]: Currently, it has only one developer but he's awesome.

2109
02:14:53,479 --> 02:14:54,479
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's the bullshit part.

2110
02:14:54,879 --> 02:15:01,781
[SPEAKER_08]: He's been making so much money from people paying for it, PayPal fucking froze his account due to a suspicious withdrawal or deposit.

2111
02:15:03,021 --> 02:15:03,641
[SPEAKER_08]: That's pretty funny.

2112
02:15:06,802 --> 02:15:09,443
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm actually going to look at this real quick.

2113
02:15:09,463 --> 02:15:12,883
[SPEAKER_03]: Hitstun in our chatroom says there's a lot of Minecraft on Justin.tv.

2114
02:15:13,604 --> 02:15:14,484
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't look that bad.

2115
02:15:14,544 --> 02:15:19,125
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks really Super Nintendo-ish 3D.

2116
02:15:20,834 --> 02:15:25,505
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, apparently he... It was over 600,000 euros and then...

2117
02:15:30,012 --> 02:15:32,193
[SPEAKER_08]: PayPal is like trying to keep the money or something.

2118
02:15:32,353 --> 02:15:32,833
[SPEAKER_08]: That's weird.

2119
02:15:33,294 --> 02:15:34,134
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of screwed up.

2120
02:15:34,254 --> 02:15:35,254
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that is messed up.

2121
02:15:35,695 --> 02:15:36,875
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, I'm going to continue.

2122
02:15:37,696 --> 02:15:44,299
[SPEAKER_08]: Minecraft may seem odd at first, but it's great and freaking addictive when you realize all the possible things you can do slash make.

2123
02:15:45,339 --> 02:15:50,862
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I think that's enough for one email, but I'll chat slash call in if I have anything else of interest that comes up.

2124
02:15:51,502 --> 02:15:53,623
[SPEAKER_08]: May the flying spaghetti monster bless your souls.

2125
02:15:53,783 --> 02:15:54,904
[SPEAKER_08]: Dark Yusuke, a.k.a.

2126
02:15:54,984 --> 02:15:55,264
[SPEAKER_08]: Butcher.

2127
02:15:55,484 --> 02:15:55,864
[SPEAKER_03]: Ramen.

2128
02:15:57,219 --> 02:15:57,579
[SPEAKER_08]: P.S.

2129
02:15:57,759 --> 02:16:00,462
[SPEAKER_08]: Going to be super sad to not hear your voices next week.

2130
02:16:01,803 --> 02:16:03,384
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess he's not going to be listening next week.

2131
02:16:04,024 --> 02:16:05,065
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I forgot.

2132
02:16:05,125 --> 02:16:07,087
[SPEAKER_03]: He sent us a tweet that said disregard is P.S.

2133
02:16:07,647 --> 02:16:07,967
[SPEAKER_03]: Oops.

2134
02:16:08,488 --> 02:16:08,908
[SPEAKER_08]: Oopsie.

2135
02:16:09,408 --> 02:16:09,829
[SPEAKER_08]: Whoops.

2136
02:16:12,251 --> 02:16:13,051
[SPEAKER_03]: Screwed up on that one.

2137
02:16:13,612 --> 02:16:19,016
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he might have us mixed up with Bobby Blackwolf because Bobby's not live next week.

2138
02:16:19,156 --> 02:16:20,037
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, YouTube.

2139
02:16:20,297 --> 02:16:21,257
[SPEAKER_03]: Alan sent me this YouTube.

2140
02:16:21,278 --> 02:16:22,739
[SPEAKER_03]: And if Alan sent it to me, I have to look at it.

2141
02:16:22,799 --> 02:16:24,060
[SPEAKER_03]: He told me a little bit about what it is.

2142
02:16:24,080 --> 02:16:25,160
[SPEAKER_03]: And I had heard of this.

2143
02:16:25,821 --> 02:16:26,802
[SPEAKER_03]: And it sounds kind of cool.

2144
02:16:29,029 --> 02:16:31,130
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's like stop motion.

2145
02:16:31,690 --> 02:16:37,012
[SPEAKER_03]: All these people in colored shirts sitting in chairs doing Pac-Man.

2146
02:16:37,673 --> 02:16:38,753
[SPEAKER_08]: They do these in a movie theater.

2147
02:16:39,193 --> 02:16:39,813
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of rad.

2148
02:16:39,893 --> 02:16:42,194
[SPEAKER_06]: Can Alan link that in chat, please?

2149
02:16:42,254 --> 02:16:42,574
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

2150
02:16:49,352 --> 02:16:50,733
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the little noise in the background.

2151
02:16:50,753 --> 02:16:51,653
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me turn that up a little bit.

2152
02:16:51,914 --> 02:16:53,715
[SPEAKER_06]: I love the noises more than anything.

2153
02:16:53,835 --> 02:16:58,257
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, anyway, this makes for terrible radio, but... People did a Space Invaders one.

2154
02:16:59,158 --> 02:17:00,839
[SPEAKER_06]: That takes a lot of work.

2155
02:17:00,859 --> 02:17:02,380
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, that took all day.

2156
02:17:18,988 --> 02:17:20,930
[SPEAKER_03]: God, college kids.

2157
02:17:21,830 --> 02:17:24,232
[SPEAKER_03]: Y'all have too much free time.

2158
02:17:24,712 --> 02:17:34,860
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a lot of it's editing though because all they had to do was get one scene where everybody was sitting in the grid in the beginning and then just take one shot of that and then keep superimposing where he's at.

2159
02:17:37,222 --> 02:17:41,886
[SPEAKER_04]: It does take a lot of effort but it's not as much as magic and witchcraft.

2160
02:17:42,166 --> 02:17:47,710
[SPEAKER_04]: Or they took one shot where he was in each spot and just kept playing stop motion.

2161
02:17:47,730 --> 02:17:48,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Makes sense.

2162
02:17:48,411 --> 02:17:48,551
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2163
02:17:49,131 --> 02:17:51,093
[SPEAKER_03]: They had to hold that camera real steady.

2164
02:17:51,953 --> 02:17:52,654
[SPEAKER_03]: Real steady.

2165
02:17:54,275 --> 02:17:56,657
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, it's that time of the show where we get mad.

2166
02:17:56,957 --> 02:17:57,758
[SPEAKER_02]: The FUs of the Week.

2167
02:18:14,268 --> 02:18:18,629
[SPEAKER_08]: My FU of the week goes to Dan not being here.

2168
02:18:19,689 --> 02:18:22,390
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I mean, and I understand it was important to go to see his family.

2169
02:18:23,130 --> 02:18:33,113
[SPEAKER_08]: But still, it doesn't really stop me from being very lonely because he's been... You know, while he's not working and I wasn't working, I was used to having him here all day and it was really nice.

2170
02:18:33,273 --> 02:18:35,733
[SPEAKER_08]: And now he's not there.

2171
02:18:35,873 --> 02:18:41,374
[SPEAKER_08]: And also, I have to go back into the office tomorrow because bitches didn't send me my letter about getting laid off.

2172
02:18:41,735 --> 02:18:43,255
[SPEAKER_08]: And I haven't been paid in two weeks.

2173
02:18:44,376 --> 02:18:45,396
[SPEAKER_08]: So you know what this means.

2174
02:18:46,077 --> 02:18:46,437
[SPEAKER_02]: War.

2175
02:18:46,577 --> 02:18:56,285
[SPEAKER_08]: If they don't fix it, I can collect interest on my pay, and if they don't get anything to me, I'm going to the labor board.

2176
02:18:56,365 --> 02:18:57,106
[SPEAKER_03]: Alert the media.

2177
02:18:58,624 --> 02:19:12,391
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I could talk to the media, too, because... I don't know how far I want to get into this, but I was looking at work at the news and the latest things, and I saw your work on the local news media site, so... about the closure, because I guess it was a big deal.

2178
02:19:12,471 --> 02:19:14,592
[SPEAKER_08]: And see, I never got any memo that says don't talk about it.

2179
02:19:15,733 --> 02:19:15,953
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh!

2180
02:19:16,253 --> 02:19:16,773
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not under a DA.

2181
02:19:16,793 --> 02:19:16,833
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

2182
02:19:16,873 --> 02:19:17,113
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, Loki.

2183
02:19:23,188 --> 02:19:26,612
[SPEAKER_04]: I had some that I was really pissed off about earlier, and I don't remember what it was.

2184
02:19:26,912 --> 02:19:33,399
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go with my second thing that I'm pissed off at, and that would be Apple.

2185
02:19:33,560 --> 02:19:35,261
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm pissed off at their customer service.

2186
02:19:35,762 --> 02:19:37,584
[SPEAKER_04]: It's good and terrible at the same time.

2187
02:19:38,285 --> 02:19:44,532
[SPEAKER_04]: The reps are nice, but the simple logic stuff just doesn't seem to apply to them.

2188
02:19:45,012 --> 02:19:54,696
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, I purchased two iPod Touches from them using an Apple gift card that I got from Sony from my work for some sort of sales incentive thing.

2189
02:19:55,956 --> 02:20:04,600
[SPEAKER_04]: I purchased it on the 3rd, and according to the site when I ordered it, it said it was going to be shipped this week.

2190
02:20:05,580 --> 02:20:08,922
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead, this week, they changed it so that it's shipping next week.

2191
02:20:09,782 --> 02:20:13,544
[SPEAKER_04]: and, you know, in the meanwhile, you know, the Apple Store has tons of these.

2192
02:20:13,604 --> 02:20:16,505
[SPEAKER_04]: They have just like a pile of them just sitting there.

2193
02:20:16,945 --> 02:20:23,288
[SPEAKER_04]: So I called them up multiple times going, um, I need to cancel my order so that, you know, I can go purchase.

2194
02:20:23,428 --> 02:20:24,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm sorry.

2195
02:20:24,408 --> 02:20:31,031
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though we took off the funds immediately out of your card, it's going to take us five to seven business days to put it back on the card.

2196
02:20:31,051 --> 02:20:31,331
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

2197
02:20:31,551 --> 02:20:33,272
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though it's their own Apple card.

2198
02:20:33,352 --> 02:20:33,472
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

2199
02:20:33,752 --> 02:20:34,634
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, well, okay, fine.

2200
02:20:34,654 --> 02:20:35,715
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really want to cancel it.

2201
02:20:35,776 --> 02:20:39,261
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to pick it up at the local store because they have them in stock.

2202
02:20:39,782 --> 02:20:40,423
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no, I'm sorry.

2203
02:20:40,443 --> 02:20:42,747
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't do that because our systems are separate.

2204
02:20:44,076 --> 02:20:44,957
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's retarded.

2205
02:20:45,137 --> 02:20:47,379
[SPEAKER_04]: It finally shipped, though, on Friday.

2206
02:20:47,759 --> 02:20:48,840
[SPEAKER_04]: FROM CANADA!

2207
02:20:49,460 --> 02:20:53,683
[SPEAKER_04]: Why the fuck are you shipping something from Canada to the United States?

2208
02:20:53,883 --> 02:20:56,926
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure you have a fucking plant in the U.S.

2209
02:20:57,006 --> 02:20:58,387
[SPEAKER_04]: that you could ship these from.

2210
02:20:58,707 --> 02:21:01,689
[SPEAKER_04]: But no, let's pick a really far away place to ship it from.

2211
02:21:01,930 --> 02:21:03,291
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to piss me off even more.

2212
02:21:03,571 --> 02:21:09,295
[SPEAKER_04]: If I didn't have that fucking gift card, I wouldn't be buying your stupid iPods.

2213
02:21:10,136 --> 02:21:12,758
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I'm fucking going to buy an ITV or an iMac.

2214
02:21:13,326 --> 02:21:14,088
[SPEAKER_04]: No way!

2215
02:21:15,170 --> 02:21:15,972
[SPEAKER_04]: We're part of Canada.

2216
02:21:17,235 --> 02:21:17,816
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

2217
02:21:18,337 --> 02:21:19,700
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not familiar with Canada.

2218
02:21:20,101 --> 02:21:22,406
[SPEAKER_04]: I can look that up real quick while you do your FGs, though.

2219
02:21:23,050 --> 02:21:23,370
[SPEAKER_03]: I will.

2220
02:21:23,450 --> 02:21:32,153
[SPEAKER_03]: My FU goes to myself because I've managed to put a scratch on my brand new car after having it for only about two and a half months because I don't know how to park.

2221
02:21:33,254 --> 02:21:34,354
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't worry, I didn't hit another car.

2222
02:21:34,374 --> 02:21:38,375
[SPEAKER_03]: I refrain from making fun of me because I will destroy you.

2223
02:21:39,396 --> 02:21:42,297
[SPEAKER_03]: I scratched the car parking in Alan's garage.

2224
02:21:43,357 --> 02:21:45,440
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

2225
02:22:02,523 --> 02:22:05,544
[SPEAKER_04]: Because there's no Shanghai, Canada It's China!

2226
02:22:05,884 --> 02:22:28,713
[SPEAKER_04]: They're shipping it from China Yeah, let's pick the furthest place from my location to ship this from That's probably where the damn thing's made I like that, that's awesome Oh, and by the way, because Apple's so wonderful in saving their costs They ship them separate The two items are actually separate Thank you Thank you for doing all that wonderful stuff for me Why are you mad, though?

2227
02:22:33,137 --> 02:22:34,058
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, more news.

2258
02:26:11,286 --> 02:26:12,647
[SPEAKER_03]: hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this?

2259
02:26:14,164 --> 02:26:15,745
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, this is DJ Blaziken.

2260
02:26:15,885 --> 02:26:17,686
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Blaziken, what's on your mind?

2261
02:26:19,707 --> 02:26:38,216
[SPEAKER_10]: Not much, other than I got a little bit of a similar situation that Loki kind of discussed a while back on an episode how he's trying to stray away from the three fret formation because he was a converger from guitar freaks to guitar hero.

2262
02:26:38,276 --> 02:26:39,377
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, let's just say here,

2263
02:26:40,114 --> 02:26:43,998
[SPEAKER_10]: I had the same excuse when I started playing Guitar Hero.

2264
02:26:44,618 --> 02:26:46,620
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, I cannot play medium.

2265
02:26:46,860 --> 02:26:47,801
[SPEAKER_10]: There's four notes.

2266
02:26:48,141 --> 02:26:49,643
[SPEAKER_10]: There should only be three.

2267
02:26:49,663 --> 02:26:51,404
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, it wasn't that hard.

2268
02:26:51,945 --> 02:26:52,786
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't that hard.

2269
02:26:53,026 --> 02:26:58,371
[SPEAKER_10]: And all it takes is Loki, one word, practice.

2270
02:26:58,771 --> 02:27:00,072
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right, practice.

2271
02:27:00,833 --> 02:27:02,394
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but that also takes time.

2272
02:27:02,955 --> 02:27:04,716
[SPEAKER_04]: And time I'm not willing to spend on that.

2273
02:27:05,237 --> 02:27:06,418
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll mod grant that instead.

2274
02:27:08,149 --> 02:27:13,693
[SPEAKER_10]: I will say, though, I recently downloaded and played the DJ Hero 2 demo.

2275
02:27:15,234 --> 02:27:16,115
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I forgot that's out.

2276
02:27:16,235 --> 02:27:16,935
[SPEAKER_03]: I did half that.

2277
02:27:17,216 --> 02:27:17,716
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

2278
02:27:17,756 --> 02:27:22,919
[SPEAKER_03]: Those bastards didn't put it on PlayStation Network, though, and my controller and gamer for PlayStation Network.

2279
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:29,144
[SPEAKER_03]: It's exclusive to Xbox 360 because we're Activision and we suck.

2280
02:27:30,925 --> 02:27:31,865
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, okay.

2281
02:27:32,066 --> 02:27:33,887
[SPEAKER_10]: I will say, though, it is pretty cool.

2282
02:27:34,677 --> 02:27:46,048
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, on the Factor, now they have, uh, the DJ battle mode, which is basically, okay, if you remember just normal space off in Guitar Hero, it's basically what this is for DJ Hero.

2283
02:27:46,349 --> 02:27:47,169
[SPEAKER_10]: It's all it is.

2284
02:27:47,490 --> 02:27:47,710
[SPEAKER_09]: Hmm.

2285
02:27:48,206 --> 02:27:52,849
[SPEAKER_10]: So, like, you do one part, and then the other player does another part, and it goes back and forth.

2286
02:27:53,370 --> 02:28:01,396
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm still wondering, though, if they're going to do... And I forgot to ask him when he was there, if they're going to do the guitar here, or the guitar DJ stuff again.

2287
02:28:01,876 --> 02:28:02,777
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that was kind of cool.

2288
02:28:02,817 --> 02:28:04,137
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, yeah.

2289
02:28:04,398 --> 02:28:08,080
[SPEAKER_10]: By what I was seeing on the demo, there wasn't anything for guitar and DJ.

2290
02:28:08,140 --> 02:28:11,223
[SPEAKER_10]: It was mostly the vocals and DJ stuff.

2291
02:28:11,243 --> 02:28:11,663
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

2292
02:28:12,103 --> 02:28:21,591
[SPEAKER_10]: and my father kind of found it kind of weird that I was singing the song Don't Ya, the Don't Ya remix and then the Lady Gaga remix.

2293
02:28:22,712 --> 02:28:29,138
[SPEAKER_04]: It would have been cool though if they did that because they could have had vocals and they could have had guitars and then a DJ or something.

2294
02:28:30,783 --> 02:28:35,629
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, that would be great for Loki to get that on YouTube too, doing a Doncha.

2295
02:28:35,729 --> 02:28:50,627
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what they really should have done, but I'm sure they don't want to affect their DJ Hero sales, is you know how Rock Band 3 added keyboards, have the next Guitar Hero game add turntables to the actual rock stuff.

2296
02:28:51,932 --> 02:28:53,473
[SPEAKER_03]: How many songs really support that though?

2297
02:28:53,493 --> 02:28:57,156
[SPEAKER_04]: Not many, but it'd be kind of neat though, like as a little added download content.

2298
02:28:57,196 --> 02:29:00,359
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, it's just like how many songs support a guitar in DJ Hero?

2299
02:29:00,919 --> 02:29:03,101
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a lot, but it was pretty cool, the ones that did.

2300
02:29:03,581 --> 02:29:04,962
[SPEAKER_10]: And actually, do you know what?

2301
02:29:05,303 --> 02:29:14,050
[SPEAKER_10]: Of all the weird things, okay, you know how you guys were talking about how, you know, learning the actual dance moves from Dance Central and whatnot?

2302
02:29:14,750 --> 02:29:17,973
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, of all the weird things, one of my...

2303
02:29:20,100 --> 02:29:29,869
[SPEAKER_10]: One of my friends went to a Macy's store and actually went and tried out, I think it was Dance Central, and he showed me some of the moves to Lady Gaga's Poker Face.

2304
02:29:31,030 --> 02:29:42,641
[SPEAKER_10]: And let's just say here, I think it was that or Just Dance that came on at Homecoming, and we were actually pulling off the actual dance moves from the music video.

2305
02:29:43,704 --> 02:29:51,512
[SPEAKER_10]: and let's just say here we were getting questions asked like how do you know the moves from the video and you both got laid, right?

2306
02:29:53,174 --> 02:29:53,454
[SPEAKER_10]: huh?

2307
02:29:53,835 --> 02:29:54,115
[SPEAKER_03]: nothing

2308
02:29:56,274 --> 02:30:21,835
[SPEAKER_04]: basically our answer was we learned them from a video game people just give us a weird eye and it was the same thing it was the same thing we were doing next time next time next time you need to say private lessons private lessons is your answer next time you know it's not I mean because see a game like you know even even just dance actually it's not you know just it shows you dance moves but I don't know if

2309
02:30:22,615 --> 02:30:23,936
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2310
02:30:49,406 --> 02:30:51,048
[SPEAKER_10]: That was the last good one.

2311
02:30:51,168 --> 02:30:56,012
[SPEAKER_03]: That was one of our first songs retired from the cage match because the video was so awesome.

2312
02:30:56,372 --> 02:30:57,894
[SPEAKER_04]: It is awesome.

2313
02:30:57,994 --> 02:30:58,975
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a song on there.

2314
02:30:59,035 --> 02:31:04,579
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember which artist it is, but they have like a Tron guy dancing in the background of Just Dance 2.

2315
02:31:04,720 --> 02:31:12,847
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyways, as I was going to say, I got to pick some songs and then the Ubisoft ref, she got to pick some songs and unfortunately she picked It's Raining Men.

2316
02:31:13,367 --> 02:31:16,030
[SPEAKER_04]: So there is a video out there of me

2317
02:31:16,810 --> 02:31:23,793
[SPEAKER_04]: Trying to beat her at, you know, I was trying to be more fabulous than she was, I guess, at that.

2318
02:31:23,973 --> 02:31:25,354
[SPEAKER_04]: But I got close.

2319
02:31:25,474 --> 02:31:26,934
[SPEAKER_04]: I did not beat her, though, at that song.

2320
02:31:27,054 --> 02:31:31,376
[SPEAKER_04]: And thank God, because that would have been the only song that I actually beat her in, and that would not be good either.

2321
02:31:31,576 --> 02:31:33,737
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I just need to hear a little bit of this song here.

2322
02:31:45,117 --> 02:31:46,177
[SPEAKER_03]: This song's pretty amazing.

2323
02:31:46,897 --> 02:31:49,038
[SPEAKER_03]: Too bad this band never really went anywhere but this song.

2324
02:31:50,258 --> 02:32:00,580
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, um, by the way, uh, on the fact that, okay, I figured out a way to sort of try to play Guitar Hero Rock Band and, um, what else?

2325
02:32:00,780 --> 02:32:04,100
[SPEAKER_10]: Rock Revolution to make the guitar point like Guitar Freaks.

2326
02:32:04,620 --> 02:32:13,682
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently all I've had to do is flip my miniature miter like it's a nine-incher miter upside down, flip it to lefty mode,

2327
02:32:15,158 --> 02:32:19,001
[SPEAKER_10]: and that's how I've been able to make it play like Guitar Freaks almost.

2328
02:32:19,841 --> 02:32:22,983
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a lot of effort for such a little reward.

2329
02:32:23,443 --> 02:32:24,684
[SPEAKER_03]: But hey, whatever makes you happy, dude.

2330
02:32:25,144 --> 02:32:25,384
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

2331
02:32:26,125 --> 02:32:28,546
[SPEAKER_03]: We gotta let you go to get some more calls, dude.

2332
02:32:28,907 --> 02:32:30,968
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, I gotta cut you off because we gotta get some more calls.

2333
02:32:31,268 --> 02:32:32,008
[SPEAKER_03]: But thank you so much.

2334
02:32:33,409 --> 02:32:34,190
[SPEAKER_10]: One last thing.

2335
02:32:34,290 --> 02:32:40,574
[SPEAKER_10]: We actually did some DDR moves to, I think it was My Sharona.

2336
02:32:40,914 --> 02:32:41,034
[SPEAKER_01]: And?

2337
02:32:41,597 --> 02:32:52,304
[SPEAKER_10]: And let's just say here, one or two guys who said they might have heard your show back in the day think we should have been on Step Squad years ago and should have been at DDR Tournaments.

2338
02:32:53,945 --> 02:32:56,387
[SPEAKER_10]: We've been watching a bunch of Mel B dance videos from the tournaments.

2339
02:32:56,407 --> 02:32:57,928
[SPEAKER_03]: People remember the show from years ago.

2340
02:32:59,453 --> 02:33:16,426
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well next time take an orange bat to prom, that's all I'm saying If you really want to represent the show, later Alright, 1-877-GAME-OLR if you want to give us a call Or Orange Launch Radio on Skype if you want to give us a call that way like this person is Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

2341
02:33:17,126 --> 02:33:18,848
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, it's Ranma, what's up everyone?

2342
02:33:18,868 --> 02:33:20,049
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, Ranma, what's up?

2343
02:33:20,973 --> 02:33:21,393
[SPEAKER_12]: Not much.

2344
02:33:22,294 --> 02:33:28,437
[SPEAKER_12]: To answer what you said about the Texas Instrument Calculators, they're still making them in multiple models and flavors.

2345
02:33:28,797 --> 02:33:35,840
[SPEAKER_03]: I just would have thought that they were on model 90-100 by now, you know what I mean?

2346
02:33:35,880 --> 02:33:37,641
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead of 82, because that was years ago.

2347
02:33:38,413 --> 02:33:42,535
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, my roommate has a TI-85, but they don't make that one anymore.

2348
02:33:42,715 --> 02:33:53,979
[SPEAKER_12]: From what I remember, this is from like a few months ago, they still make the 83, the 84, 84+, 84+, Silver, the 89, and one called the Inspire.

2349
02:33:54,339 --> 02:33:55,980
[SPEAKER_12]: One side is a scientific calculator.

2350
02:33:56,200 --> 02:33:57,880
[SPEAKER_12]: You pull the keyboard out and you flip it over.

2351
02:33:57,920 --> 02:33:59,101
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like a mini computer.

2352
02:33:59,301 --> 02:34:01,221
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds like a sidekick or something.

2353
02:34:01,261 --> 02:34:01,882
[SPEAKER_03]: That's crazy.

2354
02:34:03,271 --> 02:34:16,827
[SPEAKER_12]: and yet that thing is like 200 bucks and around this time of the year the parents come in with the list of stuff that the kids need and if they're taking entry level algebra math they're told that they need a TI calculator.

2355
02:34:16,987 --> 02:34:18,488
[SPEAKER_03]: Now who remembers the TI-99-4A?

2356
02:34:20,771 --> 02:34:21,551
[SPEAKER_03]: And we remember that?

2357
02:34:22,352 --> 02:34:22,972
[SPEAKER_03]: I had that.

2358
02:34:23,032 --> 02:34:25,893
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a computer in the 1980s, the TI-99.

2359
02:34:26,074 --> 02:34:26,574
[SPEAKER_08]: I had that.

2360
02:34:26,714 --> 02:34:27,734
[SPEAKER_08]: I had that.

2361
02:34:27,854 --> 02:34:29,155
[SPEAKER_08]: With the big cartridge thing on the side?

2362
02:34:29,415 --> 02:34:31,436
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, the big old cartridge slot that went on the side.

2363
02:34:31,456 --> 02:34:32,697
[SPEAKER_08]: I've played so many games on that.

2364
02:34:32,937 --> 02:34:33,477
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

2365
02:34:33,677 --> 02:34:34,878
[SPEAKER_08]: That's one thing that I need to find.

2366
02:34:34,958 --> 02:34:35,678
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I'm in Chickie Bay.

2367
02:34:36,539 --> 02:34:38,680
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to get a TI-99 just for the heck of it?

2368
02:34:38,920 --> 02:34:39,320
[SPEAKER_08]: Shit, yeah.

2369
02:34:39,860 --> 02:34:41,681
[SPEAKER_03]: Just so you can play, like, Texas Invaders?

2370
02:34:43,742 --> 02:34:44,042
Wow.

2371
02:34:45,703 --> 02:34:46,643
[SPEAKER_03]: Would that be Mexicans?

2372
02:34:46,963 --> 02:34:49,985
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's a Space Invaders ripoff, you...

2373
02:34:51,397 --> 02:34:51,877
[SPEAKER_03]: Dingbat.

2374
02:34:51,977 --> 02:34:52,277
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

2375
02:34:52,538 --> 02:34:54,178
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, that'd be Arizona Invaders.

2376
02:34:54,438 --> 02:34:55,119
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop it.

2377
02:34:56,279 --> 02:34:56,619
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

2378
02:34:59,641 --> 02:35:01,081
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you for the update on Calculus.

2379
02:35:01,101 --> 02:35:02,982
[SPEAKER_12]: I actually have a story to tell.

2380
02:35:03,202 --> 02:35:03,943
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, make it quick.

2381
02:35:04,623 --> 02:35:04,963
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

2382
02:35:06,384 --> 02:35:15,888
[SPEAKER_12]: I was playing Scott Pilgrim vs. the World a couple of weeks ago, and I was checking my scores on the leaderboards, and I'm going to post a link in the chatroom off of TwitPick because it makes for great radio.

2383
02:35:16,208 --> 02:35:19,650
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, the funny thing is, if you look at it, I'm ranked...

2384
02:35:20,470 --> 02:35:21,650
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2385
02:35:44,818 --> 02:35:52,561
[SPEAKER_12]: I just find it funny that when I first got Rock Band, I went in and I created my band, which was my roommate's idea, which was called Rhythm and Jews.

2386
02:35:53,022 --> 02:35:59,825
[SPEAKER_12]: When I put it in, it said, and I quote, Jews are banned on Xbox Live.

2387
02:36:01,345 --> 02:36:03,206
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that was a programming issue.

2388
02:36:05,007 --> 02:36:09,749
[SPEAKER_12]: I had to go and change the E to a 3 so I can get on and play.

2389
02:36:11,542 --> 02:36:14,004
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, did you report the name for being offensive?

2390
02:36:14,024 --> 02:36:30,417
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I'm thinking, you know, call me crazy, but if Mount Gay or whatever, no, Fort Gay, West Virginia is going to get banned, I have a feeling I'm a greedy Jew might be slightly offensive, and I don't think that's a town in like South Carolina or anything.

2391
02:36:30,477 --> 02:36:32,618
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty sure that guy's just a douchebag.

2392
02:36:33,439 --> 02:36:34,999
[SPEAKER_12]: and I've seen a couple more names like that.

2393
02:36:35,220 --> 02:36:41,441
[SPEAKER_12]: So I popped in Rock Band 2, flipped the 3 back to an E and I had no problem going on live.

2394
02:36:44,482 --> 02:36:45,442
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever makes you happy.

2395
02:36:46,303 --> 02:36:48,223
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just amused by it, that's all.

2396
02:36:49,363 --> 02:36:50,844
[SPEAKER_12]: It just amuses me.

2397
02:36:50,884 --> 02:36:51,524
[SPEAKER_12]: That's all it is.

2398
02:36:52,644 --> 02:36:52,984
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

2399
02:36:54,125 --> 02:37:02,827
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that we have one sitting in studio, I have to ask the official Jew of Orange Lounge Radio, DarkSakura, are you offended by the name I'm a Greedy Jew on Xbox Live?

2400
02:37:05,677 --> 02:37:10,743
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't really get offended, I think, by other people, really, because they're the ones who are stupid and ignorant, and I'm not.

2401
02:37:11,864 --> 02:37:21,755
[SPEAKER_08]: However, he could very likely just admit all the, you know, perhaps he admits that he's Maybe perhaps he is Jewish and happens to be a bit greedy.

2402
02:37:22,636 --> 02:37:23,056
[SPEAKER_12]: That could be.

2403
02:37:23,076 --> 02:37:23,917
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe it's really SSJ100 Matt.

2404
02:37:28,201 --> 02:37:30,763
[SPEAKER_03]: You called him in the show just to make that joke, didn't you?

2405
02:37:31,483 --> 02:37:32,204
[SPEAKER_03]: You little shit.

2406
02:37:32,224 --> 02:37:33,545
[SPEAKER_12]: Kind of, sorta.

2407
02:37:33,585 --> 02:37:34,866
[SPEAKER_12]: However.

2408
02:37:35,447 --> 02:37:35,927
[SPEAKER_08]: However.

2409
02:37:44,934 --> 02:37:49,898
[SPEAKER_08]: I just have a hard time about being offended by other people's ignorance.

2410
02:37:50,279 --> 02:37:51,540
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just, they're poop.

2411
02:37:52,801 --> 02:37:53,722
[SPEAKER_03]: They're being poopy.

2412
02:37:53,802 --> 02:37:55,383
[SPEAKER_08]: Why is that person worth my time?

2413
02:37:58,270 --> 02:38:03,271
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's a symptom of society.

2414
02:38:05,752 --> 02:38:06,652
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think it's funny.

2415
02:38:07,552 --> 02:38:08,452
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think it's funny at all.

2416
02:38:09,832 --> 02:38:17,414
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm sure it is intended to be offensive, but I would rather just not give them the satisfaction of being offended.

2417
02:38:18,614 --> 02:38:18,914
[SPEAKER_08]: That's me.

2418
02:38:20,374 --> 02:38:20,754
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

2419
02:38:21,694 --> 02:38:25,135
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Ranma, any other offensive things you want to bring to the attention of our little program?

2420
02:38:27,315 --> 02:38:48,849
[SPEAKER_03]: Bababooey, Bababooey, Howard Stern Alright, bye Ranma 1877-GAME-OLR Or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you care to venture that way We're taking your calls live as we tape our show on this lovely Sunday evening Live, our women here are hot and ready to go What?

2421
02:38:49,049 --> 02:38:50,010
[SPEAKER_03]: No What?

2422
02:38:50,971 --> 02:38:54,213
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, confusing job Clearly, hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

2423
02:38:55,566 --> 02:38:56,327
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, can you guys hear me?

2424
02:38:56,767 --> 02:38:57,508
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, we can.

2425
02:38:57,568 --> 02:38:57,788
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

2426
02:38:57,808 --> 02:39:00,530
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, this is DDR Dollar Bill.

2427
02:39:00,690 --> 02:39:02,492
[SPEAKER_03]: DDR Dollar Bill, what's on your mind?

2428
02:39:02,512 --> 02:39:04,473
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, not much.

2429
02:39:05,214 --> 02:39:08,276
[SPEAKER_05]: Two things, just real quick, that shows how hell is freezing over.

2430
02:39:09,557 --> 02:39:11,279
[SPEAKER_05]: First, I'm actually getting Halo Reach.

2431
02:39:11,899 --> 02:39:13,361
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my gosh, Halo Reach around.

2432
02:39:13,381 --> 02:39:14,201
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you excited for it?

2433
02:39:16,303 --> 02:39:22,428
[SPEAKER_05]: Somewhat, only because it's the last game in the series, apparently, and I'm getting a $20 gift card from Best Buy, so why not?

2434
02:39:23,943 --> 02:39:27,586
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to get more games that everybody can play, not just myself.

2435
02:39:52,386 --> 02:39:53,386
[SPEAKER_05]: Like party games.

2436
02:39:54,647 --> 02:39:55,507
[SPEAKER_05]: You could say that.

2437
02:39:55,587 --> 02:40:00,208
[SPEAKER_03]: Like games are not like... What about the PlayStation Move?

2438
02:40:00,328 --> 02:40:03,029
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's just going to be a bunch of Wii party games on the Move.

2439
02:40:03,269 --> 02:40:04,049
[SPEAKER_03]: Any interest in that?

2440
02:40:05,270 --> 02:40:08,570
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, that is the reason I'm getting it, first off, for the Move.

2441
02:40:09,771 --> 02:40:10,491
[SPEAKER_03]: Aha.

2442
02:40:10,631 --> 02:40:11,331
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go right there.

2443
02:40:11,391 --> 02:40:15,632
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just thinking... Oh, sorry.

2444
02:40:15,672 --> 02:40:15,933
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead.

2445
02:40:17,213 --> 02:40:20,054
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just thinking more games than just the Move games.

2446
02:40:20,074 --> 02:40:20,954
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, something else...

2447
02:40:22,214 --> 02:40:24,755
[SPEAKER_03]: The SingStar franchise is always a good party starter.

2448
02:40:24,875 --> 02:40:28,656
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really popular at parties because it's like karaoke, one of the karaoke games.

2449
02:40:29,117 --> 02:40:33,638
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little different from Rock Band and those games because A, it's exclusively singing and lets you do duets and stuff.

2450
02:40:33,978 --> 02:40:40,681
[SPEAKER_03]: And B, it actually shows the actual music videos in the background, which I think is kind of a nice touch, especially for people that aren't as familiar with video games.

2451
02:40:40,741 --> 02:40:42,981
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like suddenly you have a karaoke bar in your house.

2452
02:40:43,342 --> 02:40:45,542
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's all interesting in that regard.

2453
02:40:45,602 --> 02:40:47,063
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are always fun games.

2454
02:40:47,583 --> 02:40:47,983
[SPEAKER_03]: What else?

2455
02:40:48,944 --> 02:40:52,487
[SPEAKER_03]: Fun party games on the PlayStation 3 or multiplayer events.

2456
02:40:52,887 --> 02:40:56,449
[SPEAKER_03]: LittleBigPlanet, absolutely, is a PlayStation 3 exclusive.

2457
02:40:56,750 --> 02:40:59,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Up to four people can play that game at once, online or in the same house.

2458
02:40:59,992 --> 02:41:00,972
[SPEAKER_03]: Moderation Racers.

2459
02:41:01,393 --> 02:41:02,233
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's a good one, too.

2460
02:41:02,634 --> 02:41:04,155
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good one for multiplayer.

2461
02:41:04,175 --> 02:41:05,275
[SPEAKER_03]: Does it have split screens?

2462
02:41:05,295 --> 02:41:05,816
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do that all?

2463
02:41:05,836 --> 02:41:06,596
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe it does.

2464
02:41:06,817 --> 02:41:07,177
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

2465
02:41:07,857 --> 02:41:08,378
[SPEAKER_03]: Very nice.

2466
02:41:09,478 --> 02:41:11,019
[SPEAKER_03]: What are the fun little party games?

2467
02:41:11,660 --> 02:41:11,980
[SPEAKER_03]: Blur.

2468
02:41:13,041 --> 02:41:13,921
[SPEAKER_03]: Perhaps.

2469
02:41:14,021 --> 02:41:15,482
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to think of things that are exclusive.

2470
02:41:15,863 --> 02:41:18,084
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you said you had a 360, right?

2471
02:41:18,204 --> 02:41:19,985
[SPEAKER_03]: There is Buzz.

2472
02:41:21,166 --> 02:41:23,488
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Buzz is very popular for parties.

2473
02:41:23,508 --> 02:41:24,688
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the game showy game.

2474
02:41:25,029 --> 02:41:28,551
[SPEAKER_03]: When it comes to the special controllers that are just like the A, B, C, and D answers.

2475
02:41:29,111 --> 02:41:30,973
[SPEAKER_03]: And people can write their own questions and everything.

2476
02:41:31,073 --> 02:41:32,634
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a big, big party game.

2477
02:41:33,454 --> 02:41:36,036
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, you can write in your own questions?

2478
02:42:03,735 --> 02:42:04,475
[SPEAKER_03]: when anyone play that?

2479
02:42:04,535 --> 02:42:19,210
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know so I guess those are our suggestions so let us know what you end up buying and if you have fun with it I definitely will guys alright, well have fun with Playstation 3 keep on gaming and we'll talk to you later, okay?

2480
02:42:20,452 --> 02:42:23,615
[SPEAKER_03]: alright, be good guys later, we'll try alright

2481
02:42:24,172 --> 02:42:25,494
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

2482
02:42:25,534 --> 02:42:35,226
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry for those guys that didn't get through, but be sure to always leave us an email, mailbag at orangeloundradio.com or our Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR and so forth.

2483
02:42:35,746 --> 02:42:37,849
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, do you have any last minute stories you want to get to tonight?

2484
02:42:38,305 --> 02:42:39,906
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a lot tonight.

2485
02:42:41,027 --> 02:42:47,672
[SPEAKER_04]: One is that there's a rumor that the Nintendo DS, or not the DS, the 3DS will be out in Japan in November.

2486
02:42:48,113 --> 02:42:52,897
[SPEAKER_04]: This is coming from a company called Keys Factory.

2487
02:42:53,357 --> 02:42:59,021
[SPEAKER_04]: They design a bunch of DS, DSi, DSi XL peripherals.

2488
02:42:59,782 --> 02:43:03,025
[SPEAKER_04]: And apparently this is coming from their Twitter.

2489
02:43:03,765 --> 02:43:04,886
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was saying that...

2490
02:43:08,422 --> 02:43:09,082
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see here.

2491
02:43:09,223 --> 02:43:13,225
[SPEAKER_04]: It was saying November 20th is when they're expecting the system out.

2492
02:43:15,046 --> 02:43:16,567
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's interesting.

2493
02:43:16,587 --> 02:43:22,450
[SPEAKER_04]: It says on November 20th, 11 3DS products that we designed go on sale all at once.

2494
02:43:22,570 --> 02:43:25,332
[SPEAKER_04]: People who are buying the 3DS buy it at the same time.

2495
02:43:26,644 --> 02:43:27,445
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2496
02:43:41,964 --> 02:43:43,385
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so that's that.

2497
02:43:43,566 --> 02:43:51,231
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, uh, Nights in the Nightmare, a game that was originally out on the Nintendo DS from Atlus, uh, is coming to the PSP.

2498
02:43:51,932 --> 02:44:02,300
[SPEAKER_04]: And kind of as an added bonus, um, they are going to be giving you a copy, a digital copy that is, of, um, and I cannot pronounce this, but we're going to try.

2499
02:44:03,120 --> 02:44:04,361
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, looks like, uh...

2500
02:44:05,462 --> 02:44:07,363
[SPEAKER_04]: Yggdra Union, I guess.

2501
02:44:07,964 --> 02:44:16,609
[SPEAKER_04]: Y-G-G-D-R-A And that's going to be in every launch copy of Knights of the Nightmare.

2502
02:44:16,929 --> 02:44:21,291
[SPEAKER_04]: But knowing Atlas, that will be all the copies of Knights of the Nightmare on PSP.

2503
02:44:21,571 --> 02:44:25,534
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's scheduled to come out November 9th.

2504
02:44:27,495 --> 02:44:28,055
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's kind of cool.

2505
02:44:30,597 --> 02:44:31,257
[SPEAKER_04]: And that'd be it.

2506
02:44:32,443 --> 02:44:33,984
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, that's kind of slow on the last minute news.

2507
02:44:34,004 --> 02:44:35,345
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's pretty dead.

2508
02:44:36,185 --> 02:44:36,505
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

2509
02:44:37,946 --> 02:44:43,789
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's going to do it for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio, but not before we get around and get everybody's final thought.

2510
02:44:45,010 --> 02:44:46,411
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, do you have a final thought tonight?

2511
02:44:46,991 --> 02:44:47,631
[SPEAKER_03]: Sue books!

2512
02:44:51,081 --> 02:44:53,262
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we please make that the fortune cookie message tonight?

2513
02:44:53,642 --> 02:44:57,124
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what you had picked, but... Okay, okay, okay.

2514
02:44:57,264 --> 02:44:58,025
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, thank you.

2515
02:44:58,665 --> 02:44:59,005
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

2516
02:44:59,085 --> 02:45:00,206
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me pick one once in a while.

2517
02:45:00,226 --> 02:45:03,648
[SPEAKER_03]: I had Louis Black, so... We'll roll him over to next week.

2518
02:45:03,688 --> 02:45:04,128
[SPEAKER_03]: You won't mind.

2519
02:45:04,208 --> 02:45:04,488
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2520
02:45:05,769 --> 02:45:07,089
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, your final thought tonight?

2521
02:45:07,269 --> 02:45:08,410
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't catch that reference.

2522
02:45:08,590 --> 02:45:09,170
[SPEAKER_03]: You will soon.

2523
02:45:09,931 --> 02:45:11,912
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2524
02:45:11,972 --> 02:45:14,293
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that it for your final... I don't get it.

2525
02:45:14,733 --> 02:45:17,695
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully I'll have a connect in two weeks.

2526
02:45:18,729 --> 02:45:18,969
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

2527
02:45:19,589 --> 02:45:20,189
[SPEAKER_03]: Cross my fingers.

2528
02:45:20,510 --> 02:45:24,171
[SPEAKER_03]: My final thought is I don't know.

2529
02:45:26,411 --> 02:45:26,731
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

2530
02:45:27,031 --> 02:45:27,912
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my final thought.

2531
02:45:28,712 --> 02:45:29,192
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

2532
02:45:29,612 --> 02:45:29,992
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.

2533
02:45:30,072 --> 02:45:30,973
