1
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:09,442
[SPEAKER_08]: And welcome back everybody to the Orange Lounge Radio Marathon.

2
00:00:09,502 --> 00:00:11,644
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right, we're doing a marathon podcast this week.

3
00:00:12,604 --> 00:00:13,725
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically, just because we can.

4
00:00:13,765 --> 00:00:15,546
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to podcast as long as we possibly can.

5
00:00:15,886 --> 00:00:17,888
[SPEAKER_08]: Here on this Saturday, September the 5th of 2010.

6
00:00:19,048 --> 00:00:20,629
[SPEAKER_08]: It won't be anything that impressive, you guys.

7
00:00:20,649 --> 00:00:26,153
[SPEAKER_08]: We're thinking about going about for 12 hours or so, just talking about video games and reminiscing about old games and all that good stuff.

8
00:00:27,233 --> 00:00:30,275
[SPEAKER_08]: So we just finished the normal show.

9
00:00:30,355 --> 00:00:34,077
[SPEAKER_08]: So if this is the first thing that you're hearing on the podcast feed, you're going to want to go back.

10
00:00:34,318 --> 00:00:37,599
[SPEAKER_08]: The actual show show was put up earlier this week.

11
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:40,761
[SPEAKER_08]: So just double check your podcast feed to make sure you kind of have everything.

12
00:00:42,302 --> 00:01:04,714
[SPEAKER_08]: at the very end of the show we had some problems with our chat room our internet went down right in the middle of everything and we ended up getting booted from our server and all this stuff it was terrible but we think we've got that all worked out thank you to Alan who is like a bigger nerd than me I never thought I would be able to say that but yes he's a bigger nerd than me he knew how to set this whole thing up what are we doing right now Alan how are we getting an IRC

13
00:01:05,706 --> 00:01:11,628
[SPEAKER_10]: My roommate has a domain name that he uses for a little Linux box that we run out of our spare bedroom.

14
00:01:11,668 --> 00:01:12,668
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a little mail server.

15
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:16,410
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're SSHed into that box and we're running IRC from there.

16
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:18,530
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're just shelled into my computer at home.

17
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:20,631
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

18
00:01:21,371 --> 00:01:22,692
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a little OCD with the mic cord.

19
00:01:23,069 --> 00:01:24,590
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, tell us a little bit about the vault.

20
00:01:38,786 --> 00:01:45,230
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a room in the back of my house that has all of our game crap in it.

21
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:50,774
[SPEAKER_03]: And I totally meant to grab my iPhone so that I could actually take pictures and put them up on the website.

22
00:01:52,275 --> 00:01:54,316
[SPEAKER_08]: I could try doing the Ustream thing real fast.

23
00:01:54,356 --> 00:01:56,877
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know how well this is going to work, but I'll try it.

24
00:01:58,398 --> 00:02:00,340
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm stepping on stuff.

25
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,801
[SPEAKER_08]: Alan, you could read chat for a little bit.

26
00:02:01,821 --> 00:02:02,641
[SPEAKER_08]: Or you want to be cameraman?

27
00:02:02,721 --> 00:02:04,002
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll do cameraman for a minute here.

28
00:02:05,143 --> 00:02:06,944
[SPEAKER_08]: This is all live radio, folks.

29
00:02:08,544 --> 00:02:12,127
[SPEAKER_03]: So everyone has to come in here and pick one thing.

30
00:02:13,348 --> 00:02:14,649
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, we'll come in a minute.

31
00:02:14,669 --> 00:02:17,692
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to see if I can do this broadcasting.

32
00:02:17,752 --> 00:02:18,372
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, let's see.

33
00:02:18,713 --> 00:02:22,015
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, since we're already in here, Bradley, why don't you pick something?

34
00:02:23,316 --> 00:02:25,118
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, I'm going to bring in the camera, okay?

35
00:02:25,438 --> 00:02:26,899
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to bring in the camera.

36
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:27,400
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that okay?

37
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,301
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, just as long as it's not me on it.

38
00:02:29,361 --> 00:02:30,082
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll try my best.

39
00:02:30,122 --> 00:02:31,063
[SPEAKER_08]: Just dodge my phone.

40
00:02:31,383 --> 00:02:32,584
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I better put my phone back in here.

41
00:02:32,784 --> 00:02:33,044
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

42
00:02:33,825 --> 00:02:34,886
[SPEAKER_03]: I had Bradley pick something.

43
00:02:35,399 --> 00:02:38,260
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.

44
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:40,740
[SPEAKER_08]: We're live and I don't even know where we're at.

45
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:46,702
[SPEAKER_08]: We're at Ustream slash Orange Lounge, I think, is where we're broadcasting at.

46
00:02:47,622 --> 00:02:49,283
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm going to go make my way into the vault.

47
00:02:50,763 --> 00:02:52,424
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll give my mic to Alan while I walk over there.

48
00:02:53,104 --> 00:03:00,046
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now we have Bradley going through the Saturn section of my house, which is pretty much our domestic Saturn stuff.

49
00:03:00,866 --> 00:03:01,806
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, at the moment.

50
00:03:01,906 --> 00:03:04,647
[SPEAKER_03]: And the dusty little things here.

51
00:03:06,215 --> 00:03:07,616
[SPEAKER_02]: is it like candy what was that is it like candy

52
00:03:20,942 --> 00:03:25,185
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

53
00:03:25,485 --> 00:03:26,046
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

54
00:03:26,086 --> 00:03:26,826
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw one up here.

55
00:03:27,327 --> 00:03:28,848
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Blazing Dragons.

56
00:03:28,868 --> 00:03:29,608
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a fun game.

57
00:03:29,869 --> 00:03:33,191
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a puzzle game where you control the dragon.

58
00:03:34,892 --> 00:03:36,674
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go ahead and pull it out.

59
00:03:36,714 --> 00:03:40,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Put it on the camera.

60
00:03:40,797 --> 00:03:43,839
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, there are Capcom shot glasses.

61
00:03:47,768 --> 00:04:01,803
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead and put it up on the... Basically it's a comedy puzzle game where you go around and try to figure out how to solve certain puzzles where you gotta satisfy what a person wants you to do for them.

62
00:04:03,204 --> 00:04:11,287
[SPEAKER_02]: Something like you need to wash all the dishes, so you have to put together a Rube Goldberg device to rig up the dishes.

63
00:04:12,068 --> 00:04:23,773
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, it puts something on top of a fire to blow a turntable around or a fan around so they can put it in a system.

64
00:04:24,553 --> 00:04:29,115
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's catapulting one place where you have to shoot a cat at a wall.

65
00:04:30,831 --> 00:04:32,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, your turn to pick something.

66
00:04:45,072 --> 00:04:45,632
[SPEAKER_08]: Am I on here?

67
00:04:45,672 --> 00:04:46,273
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't even know.

68
00:04:46,393 --> 00:04:48,394
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it going through, Alan?

69
00:04:48,994 --> 00:04:52,656
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't usually do remote broadcasting from the other rooms, so this is a little different for us.

70
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:54,797
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what to pick.

71
00:04:56,178 --> 00:04:57,919
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, you want to hold this while I dig through something?

72
00:04:58,059 --> 00:04:58,979
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, hold on.

73
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,281
[SPEAKER_08]: This is awesome radio, I'm sure.

74
00:05:03,422 --> 00:05:08,424
[SPEAKER_08]: I see all these NES games up here, and I'm assuming that one of these is going to be something awesome.

75
00:05:09,065 --> 00:05:09,425
[SPEAKER_09]: It could be.

76
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:10,760
[SPEAKER_08]: or it could suck.

77
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,260
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

78
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:16,382
[SPEAKER_08]: God, you have like all these like Japanese games stacked on top of everything too.

79
00:05:16,402 --> 00:05:16,802
[SPEAKER_03]: What are those?

80
00:05:17,262 --> 00:05:17,542
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

81
00:05:17,582 --> 00:05:17,942
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

82
00:05:18,522 --> 00:05:20,823
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Final Fantasy 3 and Mappy.

83
00:05:20,883 --> 00:05:21,323
[SPEAKER_08]: And Mappy.

84
00:05:21,343 --> 00:05:22,784
[SPEAKER_08]: And apparently you paid 20 bucks for each one.

85
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:23,164
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I didn't.

86
00:05:23,184 --> 00:05:23,564
[SPEAKER_03]: I paid five.

87
00:05:24,944 --> 00:05:25,684
[SPEAKER_08]: They were marked down.

88
00:05:25,744 --> 00:05:26,244
[SPEAKER_08]: They were marked down.

89
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:27,285
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see what's in this one here.

90
00:05:29,265 --> 00:05:31,586
[SPEAKER_08]: Gradius, Track and Field, Contra.

91
00:05:32,146 --> 00:05:33,546
[SPEAKER_03]: Just push the button.

92
00:05:33,587 --> 00:05:33,947
[SPEAKER_08]: What happened?

93
00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:34,167
[SPEAKER_08]: Did it?

94
00:05:34,347 --> 00:05:34,727
[SPEAKER_03]: It locked.

95
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:35,427
[SPEAKER_03]: It locked?

96
00:05:35,867 --> 00:05:36,167
[SPEAKER_03]: Warning.

97
00:05:36,567 --> 00:05:36,867
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

98
00:05:37,067 --> 00:05:38,148
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we go live?

99
00:05:38,628 --> 00:05:38,788
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

100
00:05:38,808 --> 00:05:38,888
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

101
00:05:40,109 --> 00:05:41,671
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, now we're connecting now.

102
00:05:41,691 --> 00:05:43,293
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe we have to plug it in, I don't know.

103
00:05:44,154 --> 00:05:45,515
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, we're connecting now.

104
00:05:45,556 --> 00:05:45,836
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

105
00:05:46,156 --> 00:05:48,439
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, I wasn't prepared to dig through here.

106
00:05:48,499 --> 00:05:49,580
[SPEAKER_08]: Hold on, let me look at Super Nintendo.

107
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,121
[SPEAKER_08]: Got your mic.

108
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:50,221
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi.

109
00:05:50,241 --> 00:05:50,441
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello.

110
00:05:51,563 --> 00:05:52,263
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.

111
00:05:57,765 --> 00:06:02,908
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think someone looked up the correct channel name and put it in IRC.

112
00:06:02,949 --> 00:06:08,512
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's orange-lounge-radio for the Ustream.

113
00:06:09,433 --> 00:06:11,194
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's all taken care of.

114
00:06:11,494 --> 00:06:12,215
[SPEAKER_07]: Good, good deal.

115
00:06:13,355 --> 00:06:13,996
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

116
00:06:15,217 --> 00:06:17,238
[SPEAKER_07]: You got all these Mega Man games in this one.

117
00:06:18,039 --> 00:06:24,083
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

118
00:06:24,143 --> 00:06:25,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob started to make the face.

119
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:38,964
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll talk about this game Yep, it's Super Metroid Can you give me a mic?

120
00:06:41,148 --> 00:06:43,489
[SPEAKER_08]: Super Metroid is the game I picked up there.

121
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:48,110
[SPEAKER_08]: Super Metroid is probably one of the greatest video games they ever freaking made, ever.

122
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:49,770
[SPEAKER_08]: It's probably my favorite video game of all time.

123
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:51,090
[SPEAKER_08]: It happens to be in this little bin right here.

124
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:53,411
[SPEAKER_08]: If I can hold this up for the Ustream viewers, too.

125
00:06:54,011 --> 00:06:58,632
[SPEAKER_08]: Super Metroid is amazeballs because it's kind of a quick game.

126
00:06:59,172 --> 00:07:04,953
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not something that takes you days and days to beat, so you can play through it in a good sitting, in a day.

127
00:07:04,973 --> 00:07:07,254
[SPEAKER_08]: If you wanted to play through this tonight, we probably could.

128
00:07:07,614 --> 00:07:08,495
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

129
00:07:29,369 --> 00:07:32,210
[SPEAKER_08]: Show off different tricks or try to find things that are hidden.

130
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:38,852
[SPEAKER_08]: And it really kind of set the stage for things that followed it that are also awesome, like Castlevania, which a lot of people started calling Metroidvania.

131
00:07:39,412 --> 00:07:46,294
[SPEAKER_08]: And just the music was phenomenal and the upgrades to the weapons, just like everything about it was just super.

132
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:50,677
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's why Super Metroid is definitely a fond favorite of mine.

133
00:07:51,238 --> 00:07:55,221
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's something I've talked about many times on the show before.

134
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:56,502
[SPEAKER_08]: It's one of my personal favorite games.

135
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:58,664
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to find a box for it, I think.

136
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:02,307
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so Alan, it's your turn.

137
00:08:02,668 --> 00:08:04,069
[SPEAKER_03]: Pick us something that you see.

138
00:08:11,744 --> 00:08:13,225
[SPEAKER_08]: Sounds currently digging through the vault.

139
00:08:14,506 --> 00:08:19,109
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if I like this whole Ustream thing though because it's too much for us to monitor because trying to run the radio feed is bad enough.

140
00:08:19,349 --> 00:08:19,630
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

141
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:22,111
[SPEAKER_08]: So we might kill this video feed.

142
00:08:24,173 --> 00:08:24,433
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

143
00:08:24,533 --> 00:08:27,115
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to... I've just been running my thumb over it to keep it active.

144
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:27,315
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

145
00:08:27,335 --> 00:08:30,757
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to kill the video feed for now until we have something a little more worthy of showing on video.

146
00:08:31,338 --> 00:08:31,738
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, guys.

147
00:08:32,018 --> 00:08:32,418
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, guys.

148
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:35,821
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's also like killing the battery on my phone.

149
00:08:37,062 --> 00:08:37,562
[SPEAKER_09]: Roger, if you want.

150
00:08:37,896 --> 00:08:38,637
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess I could always do that.

151
00:08:38,678 --> 00:08:39,880
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, my phone is hot.

152
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,983
[SPEAKER_08]: It feels like it's going to explode in my hands.

153
00:08:42,043 --> 00:08:43,225
[SPEAKER_08]: That's probably not a good thing, is it?

154
00:08:43,245 --> 00:08:43,746
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it gushy?

155
00:08:44,908 --> 00:08:49,035
[SPEAKER_08]: So tell the listeners a little bit about where you collect all of these different games from.

156
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,541
[SPEAKER_03]: Every freaking where.

157
00:08:50,721 --> 00:08:51,682
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, seriously.

158
00:08:54,224 --> 00:09:05,954
[SPEAKER_03]: We used to just go hit up thrift stores and the flea market and a couple of used game places in town and just pick up things when we could find them.

159
00:09:06,454 --> 00:09:11,759
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, when we got our Nomad, it was right when they stopped making the Nomads and we managed to get ours on clearance for $25.

160
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:11,899
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

161
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:14,481
[SPEAKER_03]: Marvel Super Heroes for the Sega Saturn

162
00:09:37,807 --> 00:10:05,042
[SPEAKER_10]: one of the advantages of owning a Saturn in the US compared to the original PlayStation was that the original PlayStation was crap for 2D games the Saturn could do arcade perfect frame rates for all of the over-the-top Capcom X-Men licensed games like Children of the Atom I got my Saturn for this game and then I got it chipped and I imported Darkstalkers 3 and X-Men vs. Street Fighter so this is definitely a lot of hours logged on this one

163
00:10:07,299 --> 00:10:08,640
[SPEAKER_03]: I really like that game.

164
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:17,523
[SPEAKER_03]: Although, I wonder what it would have been like if they had released the 1 meg and 4 meg cart in the US, if that would have just made it completely a lot more awesome.

165
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:21,605
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that's why X-Men vs. Street Fighter is only really playable on the Saturn.

166
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:24,125
[SPEAKER_03]: Because of the cartridge.

167
00:10:24,586 --> 00:10:27,427
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, my turn.

168
00:10:28,307 --> 00:10:29,948
[SPEAKER_03]: Shoot, this is all my shit.

169
00:10:33,004 --> 00:10:33,384
[SPEAKER_03]: Crap.

170
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:37,007
[SPEAKER_09]: I know hue cards are in there somewhere.

171
00:10:38,548 --> 00:10:40,609
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you done some rearranging in the vault lately?

172
00:10:40,689 --> 00:10:41,450
[SPEAKER_03]: Dan did some.

173
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:43,051
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys took the couch out of here.

174
00:10:43,151 --> 00:10:44,552
[SPEAKER_03]: The futon is gone.

175
00:10:44,612 --> 00:10:45,072
[SPEAKER_03]: We got rid of it.

176
00:10:45,172 --> 00:10:45,452
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, wow.

177
00:10:45,472 --> 00:10:48,334
[SPEAKER_08]: I was thinking we'd all have a futon to sit on in here, but I guess that's not the case.

178
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:50,316
[SPEAKER_08]: So we will have to go out to the front room at some point.

179
00:10:50,716 --> 00:10:52,297
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully our mics will get us out there, too.

180
00:10:52,897 --> 00:10:53,398
[SPEAKER_08]: That'll be good.

181
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:53,938
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure.

182
00:10:54,098 --> 00:10:55,819
[SPEAKER_09]: God, I can't think.

183
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,481
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm noticing Atari 2600 stuff here.

184
00:10:58,501 --> 00:11:01,643
[SPEAKER_03]: This is sort of our, we have nowhere else to put this stuff shelf.

185
00:11:03,425 --> 00:11:07,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, C-Man, so we can friend your butt.

186
00:11:09,091 --> 00:11:14,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I think this is, um, nope, that's not it.

187
00:11:14,578 --> 00:11:18,262
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a soundtrack for Berserk, for the video game.

188
00:11:19,229 --> 00:11:19,669
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

189
00:11:34,623 --> 00:11:35,823
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been redone since then though.

190
00:11:35,843 --> 00:11:36,423
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to do a new video.

191
00:11:36,443 --> 00:11:37,464
[SPEAKER_08]: It has changed a little bit.

192
00:11:37,484 --> 00:11:40,344
[SPEAKER_08]: We do need to get some new video other than what we just showed on Ustream.

193
00:11:40,384 --> 00:11:43,825
[SPEAKER_08]: But you can get an idea just how massive this collection is.

194
00:11:43,925 --> 00:11:47,986
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, you know, I'm looking one way and I see two TVs up on the wall.

195
00:11:48,506 --> 00:11:50,326
[SPEAKER_08]: PlayStation 2 rack of games.

196
00:11:50,427 --> 00:11:51,787
[SPEAKER_08]: I see Neo Geo games.

197
00:11:52,207 --> 00:11:53,747
[SPEAKER_08]: I see all these arcade sticks.

198
00:11:54,367 --> 00:11:55,128
[SPEAKER_08]: I look another way.

199
00:11:55,168 --> 00:11:56,508
[SPEAKER_08]: I see different steering wheels.

200
00:11:56,768 --> 00:11:57,488
[SPEAKER_08]: I picked something.

201
00:11:57,588 --> 00:11:59,068
[SPEAKER_08]: A CDX.

202
00:11:59,348 --> 00:11:59,989
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a CDX.

203
00:12:00,009 --> 00:12:00,749
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not picking a game.

204
00:12:00,769 --> 00:12:01,629
[SPEAKER_08]: You're picking a CDX.

205
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,461
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I didn't say you had to pick a game.

206
00:12:03,501 --> 00:12:04,141
[SPEAKER_03]: I said pick something.

207
00:12:04,221 --> 00:12:04,521
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, fine.

208
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:05,581
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you want to say about the CDX?

209
00:12:05,821 --> 00:12:10,403
[SPEAKER_03]: It's awesome and it's like having a really tiny Sega CD.

210
00:12:10,823 --> 00:12:12,764
[SPEAKER_03]: Although it does not work very well with the 32X.

211
00:12:12,784 --> 00:12:16,926
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to kind of modify the hookup and get these brackets to hold it up.

212
00:12:16,966 --> 00:12:18,486
[SPEAKER_03]: But the CDX is freaking awesome.

213
00:12:19,527 --> 00:12:20,607
[SPEAKER_03]: And I love it.

214
00:12:20,767 --> 00:12:22,048
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it quite dearly.

215
00:12:23,888 --> 00:12:25,969
[SPEAKER_08]: How'd you guys end up with two Game Gears over here?

216
00:12:25,989 --> 00:12:27,089
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm looking at two Game Gears.

217
00:12:27,129 --> 00:12:28,570
[SPEAKER_08]: One of them's blue and one of them's black.

218
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:30,651
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the blue one is Julie's.

219
00:12:31,772 --> 00:12:33,232
[SPEAKER_08]: The Game & Watch Collection

220
00:12:56,574 --> 00:13:01,657
[SPEAKER_10]: I owned a Game Gear briefly in the 8th grade, and I've seen one now.

221
00:13:01,997 --> 00:13:03,598
[SPEAKER_10]: I do not remember it being that gigantic.

222
00:13:03,979 --> 00:13:04,599
[SPEAKER_10]: It's huge.

223
00:13:04,619 --> 00:13:06,220
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like bigger than a VHS tape.

224
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,661
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't... And they're heavy.

225
00:13:07,981 --> 00:13:09,742
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we've got the battery attached to this.

226
00:13:11,183 --> 00:13:12,284
[SPEAKER_03]: The little backup battery thing.

227
00:13:12,304 --> 00:13:15,726
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't... Well, you want to see big, though.

228
00:13:15,746 --> 00:13:18,328
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got links somewhere around here.

229
00:13:20,469 --> 00:13:23,211
[SPEAKER_03]: And... All of our stuff is so dusty.

230
00:13:23,711 --> 00:13:25,372
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to... Do we have another mic on the ground?

231
00:13:29,106 --> 00:13:30,467
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we've got stuff everywhere.

232
00:13:31,808 --> 00:13:35,151
[SPEAKER_10]: I like this stress grip Game Boy Advance.

233
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:39,715
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a promo thing from E3, I think, a while back.

234
00:13:41,388 --> 00:13:47,214
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually had a pink Game Boy Advance, just to be completely opposite of what everyone would think of me, because I normally hate pink.

235
00:14:05,353 --> 00:14:08,314
[SPEAKER_03]: and I actually really dug my pink one and had pink everything.

236
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:13,978
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you noticed but a reoccurring theme in my Saturn collection is working designs and Capcom.

237
00:14:15,819 --> 00:14:20,361
[SPEAKER_10]: I still have my copy of Rayearth that working designs did for the Saturn.

238
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:24,243
[SPEAKER_10]: It's one of the last games that came out for the Saturn in the US.

239
00:14:24,804 --> 00:14:26,065
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me see what I've got up here.

240
00:14:26,085 --> 00:14:27,545
[SPEAKER_03]: Rayearth is right here.

241
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:29,990
[SPEAKER_10]: Saga Ages

242
00:14:57,837 --> 00:14:59,618
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, what's that one right there?

243
00:15:00,158 --> 00:15:02,059
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me, can I actually jump in here, you guys, real quick?

244
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:02,999
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh.

245
00:15:03,099 --> 00:15:03,860
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm actually in the other room.

246
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,220
[SPEAKER_03]: Albert Odyssey.

247
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:14,044
[SPEAKER_08]: Or I'm watching the chat room, and I actually want to jump in here and say real quick, because it is 6 o'clock Pacific at this time, so we might have some folks tuning in right now expecting to hear Orange Haunch Radio kind of like as it normally is.

248
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:19,206
[SPEAKER_08]: You forgot that this week is the marathon episode, so we've actually been on the air since 2 p.m.

249
00:15:19,606 --> 00:15:23,728
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you're just joining us now expecting to hear the normal episode of OLR, it already happened.

250
00:15:23,748 --> 00:15:24,688
[SPEAKER_08]: We finished that up at about 5.30, so...

251
00:15:26,309 --> 00:15:27,370
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki is gone.

252
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:29,071
[SPEAKER_08]: He went back to go take care of the baby.

253
00:15:29,671 --> 00:15:34,873
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm here, Rob Roberts, and DarkSakura's here as well, as well as SalaciousPop and Arcadium42.

254
00:15:34,974 --> 00:15:38,475
[SPEAKER_08]: And right now we're looking in the vault at just some old games.

255
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:45,679
[SPEAKER_08]: Just kind of thumbing through and seeing what nostalgic dust is awakened from some of it.

256
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,301
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we were going through my list of working designs games.

257
00:15:51,522 --> 00:15:53,203
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, back here, that's Albert Odyssey, I think.

258
00:15:54,123 --> 00:15:56,125
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually decided to sell my copy of that off.

259
00:15:56,165 --> 00:15:58,007
[SPEAKER_02]: I only paid a little bit of it.

260
00:15:58,027 --> 00:16:07,436
[SPEAKER_03]: You've also got Shining Wisdom, Dragon Force, Sonic R. I love Sonic R, don't get me wrong.

261
00:16:07,736 --> 00:16:08,657
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you feel the sunshine?

262
00:16:09,678 --> 00:16:10,519
[SPEAKER_03]: Does it brighten up your day?

263
00:16:13,001 --> 00:16:15,763
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, we've got tons of crap.

264
00:16:15,783 --> 00:16:22,348
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, now I want to break out the Saturn for reals and play stuff, but Dan has the Saturn hooked up in here, and the monitor's, like, little.

265
00:16:23,289 --> 00:16:25,150
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to play the Saturn in the front room.

266
00:16:25,845 --> 00:16:31,669
[SPEAKER_03]: So the stuff that we actually have hooked up right now in here is we've got things set up on Switch boxes.

267
00:16:32,269 --> 00:16:45,799
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got an Xbox 360, Dreamcast, Saturn, GameCube, Neo Geo CD, Super Nintendo, Turbo Duo, and the Sega CD32X.

268
00:16:45,819 --> 00:16:45,879
[SPEAKER_03]: And...

269
00:16:50,612 --> 00:16:52,413
[SPEAKER_03]: What else do we have sort of put away?

270
00:16:54,174 --> 00:16:55,814
[SPEAKER_03]: Where did Dan put the actual Neo Geo?

271
00:16:56,675 --> 00:16:57,955
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we actually have a Neo Geo.

272
00:16:58,536 --> 00:17:05,519
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I think it's funny, Dan got the Atari Flashback 2 that looks like the old 2600, but it's got 40 games stored in it.

273
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:09,861
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I could break out my What the Fuck game.

274
00:17:10,841 --> 00:17:12,462
[SPEAKER_03]: Cardcaptor Sakura that comes with a plate.

275
00:17:13,122 --> 00:17:13,403
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wow.

276
00:17:13,603 --> 00:17:14,983
[SPEAKER_03]: And a clock.

277
00:17:15,804 --> 00:17:16,364
[SPEAKER_03]: And silverware.

278
00:17:16,877 --> 00:17:19,819
[SPEAKER_08]: I think you showed all that in the unboxing video that you did on YouTube.

279
00:17:19,879 --> 00:17:21,120
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in the unboxing video.

280
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:28,304
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, man, I'm not trying to sound braggy or anything.

281
00:17:28,344 --> 00:17:29,665
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we just have this stuff.

282
00:17:31,486 --> 00:17:34,668
[SPEAKER_03]: And, oh, the R4 with the JogCon set.

283
00:17:35,309 --> 00:17:42,273
[SPEAKER_03]: I got that for painting a Sonic on the door of a local used game store.

284
00:17:42,293 --> 00:17:44,735
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember video game swappers back in the day.

285
00:17:46,618 --> 00:18:02,787
[SPEAKER_03]: but that's how I got my R4 and JogCon and we've got the boxes of controllers and they're just different systems and stuff here's the box of Playstation controllers which I think the NegCon is in I'm gonna fish that out who wants my mic?

286
00:18:04,591 --> 00:18:05,712
[SPEAKER_08]: GameCube and Xbox MyNedCon

287
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:35,582
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow, you guys have some really obscure stuff.

288
00:18:35,983 --> 00:18:49,338
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's talk about the vault for a little bit, because we had a lot of people in chat, and I'm sure a lot of listeners of the show that are like, wow, you guys are kind of like a special kind of crazy, having your own room in the house dedicated to like a video game museum sort of thing.

289
00:18:49,578 --> 00:18:52,081
[SPEAKER_08]: And how did this all start between you and Dan?

290
00:18:52,945 --> 00:18:53,345
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, gee.

291
00:18:53,786 --> 00:18:59,190
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, when Dan and I first got together, he had already had a bunch of stuff.

292
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:11,919
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, he had a Neo Geo and a few games, and he had a NES, and he had a SNES, and I moved out here with my SNES and a few PlayStation games, and he had a PlayStation and a Saturn, and...

293
00:19:12,739 --> 00:19:18,180
[SPEAKER_03]: We just sort of would get nostalgic about stuff and go looking for things.

294
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,880
[SPEAKER_03]: We ended up getting the Turbo Duo.

295
00:19:21,381 --> 00:19:23,481
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I think he already had the Turbo Duo when I moved out here.

296
00:19:24,221 --> 00:19:25,281
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me take it a step back.

297
00:19:25,321 --> 00:19:27,782
[SPEAKER_08]: I know you've told this story sometimes on the show before.

298
00:19:27,842 --> 00:19:28,802
[SPEAKER_08]: We have time to kill tonight.

299
00:19:28,882 --> 00:19:30,362
[SPEAKER_08]: How did you and Dan kind of end up meeting?

300
00:19:30,422 --> 00:19:32,442
[SPEAKER_08]: How did you and Dan kind of come together?

301
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:32,983
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, have a seat.

302
00:19:33,223 --> 00:19:35,443
[SPEAKER_08]: We're sitting on the floor of the vault just chatting.

303
00:19:36,163 --> 00:19:37,143
[SPEAKER_08]: No chatters right now.

304
00:19:37,203 --> 00:19:41,544
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, chat room, but you're in the other room where we can't see you, but we'll run back and look in a minute.

305
00:19:42,043 --> 00:19:51,611
[SPEAKER_03]: Back in the day, when I lived in Mobile, Alabama, Dan was a friend of mine online.

306
00:19:51,731 --> 00:19:58,097
[SPEAKER_03]: My roommates introduced me to him because he had the name Dark Ryoga and I had the name Dark Uchan.

307
00:19:58,977 --> 00:20:08,162
[SPEAKER_03]: So we hung out for a while and he was my buddy and would be up like really late my time, you know, relatively late his time.

308
00:20:08,802 --> 00:20:12,264
[SPEAKER_03]: And just exchanged bad fan fiction and he was, you know, my buddy, he was fun.

309
00:20:13,004 --> 00:20:19,808
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I had a really, really bad breakup with the guy I was with at the time.

310
00:20:20,629 --> 00:20:35,724
[SPEAKER_03]: and Dan called me and to cheer me up he had like some five minute calling cards and he ended up using like three of them I think that night and when we ended up talking the next night and I called him and he called me and we'd talk on the payphone from Denny's you know and stuff it was

311
00:20:36,785 --> 00:20:43,271
[SPEAKER_03]: And then finally one day, at the time I was working at, I think I'd since moved from working at the arcade.

312
00:20:44,311 --> 00:20:48,275
[SPEAKER_03]: I worked for Aladdin's Castle and Cyber Station at the malls.

313
00:20:48,895 --> 00:20:54,520
[SPEAKER_03]: But I went from working there to working at this herb shop kiosk in the mall.

314
00:20:55,560 --> 00:21:19,794
[SPEAKER_03]: and it was really great you know I could sit and read my books all day if I wanted to and so Dan we've been talking the night before because we're trying to open up another store so that we can make enough revenue to keep two stores open instead of having to close the one we had and I said hey if we don't get the show then in the show the store then can I come out and stay with you I was just joking he's like I guess so and so

315
00:21:20,234 --> 00:21:24,217
[SPEAKER_03]: So the next day I go to work and they said, yeah, they gave our spot to somebody else.

316
00:21:24,257 --> 00:21:25,358
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to close the store in a month.

317
00:21:26,278 --> 00:21:28,200
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, so when my boss left, I called Dan.

318
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,441
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, so were you serious?

319
00:21:29,461 --> 00:21:30,622
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, I guess so.

320
00:21:30,882 --> 00:21:32,183
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to go see Batman.

321
00:21:32,223 --> 00:21:33,003
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll talk about this later.

322
00:21:34,204 --> 00:21:36,666
[SPEAKER_03]: If that dates when the conversation happened.

323
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:39,568
[SPEAKER_08]: The original Batman was like 91.

324
00:21:40,029 --> 00:21:41,630
[SPEAKER_08]: It can't be that bad.

325
00:21:41,811 --> 00:21:44,253
[SPEAKER_08]: It was one of the sequels.

326
00:21:44,913 --> 00:21:46,575
[SPEAKER_08]: No, 89 was the original Batman.

327
00:21:50,459 --> 00:21:54,963
[SPEAKER_03]: But at any rate, I was actually on the plane probably within two weeks.

328
00:21:56,284 --> 00:22:00,067
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've been happy here ever since I came out here with 100 bucks in my pocket and a Super Nintendo.

329
00:22:01,889 --> 00:22:04,091
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you literally pack a Super Nintendo in your luggage?

330
00:22:23,104 --> 00:22:24,367
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever happened to all your stuff at home?

331
00:22:24,407 --> 00:22:25,509
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you ever go back to get it?

332
00:22:25,609 --> 00:22:27,713
[SPEAKER_08]: Or did you just have it shipped here in little bits and pieces?

333
00:22:27,773 --> 00:22:29,235
[SPEAKER_08]: Or did you just kind of let it rot?

334
00:22:29,576 --> 00:22:32,421
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I would go back and visit and bring stuff back with me.

335
00:22:32,461 --> 00:22:33,964
[SPEAKER_03]: And Grandma would send me some of my stuff.

336
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:36,731
[SPEAKER_03]: Little things like that, but I lost a lot.

337
00:22:37,112 --> 00:22:39,553
[SPEAKER_03]: I kept bringing back boxes of comics for some reason.

338
00:22:40,214 --> 00:22:45,898
[SPEAKER_03]: But a lot of my books were water damaged from how poorly they were being stored.

339
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:51,521
[SPEAKER_03]: I lost a lot of cool stuff.

340
00:22:51,581 --> 00:22:54,203
[SPEAKER_03]: I did manage to bring back a lot of cool stuff with me.

341
00:22:54,263 --> 00:22:56,605
[SPEAKER_03]: So most of my things, I think, are back with me.

342
00:22:57,005 --> 00:23:01,148
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of stuff from my dorm room I really wanted because they were things that...

343
00:23:01,708 --> 00:23:05,750
[SPEAKER_03]: People picked up for me from Civil War reenactments and Ren Fairs and things.

344
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:19,296
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so now we're kind of getting caught up to where we were at before, is that you came out here and you had only the Super Nintendo and a couple PlayStation games, but you obviously had this nerd love thing going on with Dan, right?

345
00:23:19,776 --> 00:23:21,477
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's from the AVA.

346
00:23:21,677 --> 00:23:24,098
[SPEAKER_08]: So you guys just kind of started mutually this collection together?

347
00:23:24,158 --> 00:23:27,220
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you remember what the first thing was you guys bought together?

348
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:27,840
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you remember?

349
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:27,940
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

350
00:23:28,194 --> 00:23:30,836
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really remember all that well, to be honest.

351
00:23:30,896 --> 00:23:31,897
[SPEAKER_03]: That's okay.

352
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:38,522
[SPEAKER_03]: I know one of the early things, because I think he already had a Genesis.

353
00:23:39,904 --> 00:23:41,385
[SPEAKER_03]: We picked up a Sega CD together.

354
00:23:41,445 --> 00:23:42,846
[SPEAKER_03]: That was one of the first things that we got.

355
00:23:43,446 --> 00:23:45,808
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we really wanted to play Sega CD games.

356
00:23:45,888 --> 00:23:49,071
[SPEAKER_03]: And we found it cheap, and then we got 32X after that.

357
00:23:49,812 --> 00:23:52,654
[SPEAKER_03]: It just kept growing, you know, really fast.

358
00:23:54,095 --> 00:23:55,715
[SPEAKER_03]: We would just find things.

359
00:23:55,955 --> 00:23:59,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh shoot, I was listing out all my stuff and I forgot to put my Wonderswan color on it.

360
00:24:00,277 --> 00:24:06,460
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, I was recently putting all my stuff up for Infamous.net because they wanted the list of my gaming systems and I forgot the Wonderswan.

361
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:06,840
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

362
00:24:07,621 --> 00:24:09,521
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, now you're just going to lose all that cred.

363
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:10,502
[SPEAKER_08]: Now.

364
00:24:11,207 --> 00:24:16,994
[SPEAKER_03]: But, I mean, the way things went, it was just, we would run in and, oh, that's cool, oh, that's cool, oh, that's cool.

365
00:24:17,655 --> 00:24:21,520
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, would sometimes say, I really want to play this game.

366
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:26,506
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, we picked up a Neo Geo, not Neo Geo, a Turbo Duo, not Turbo Duo.

367
00:24:27,407 --> 00:24:32,370
[SPEAKER_03]: PC Engine Core Graphics Sorry, I had to think of system and country and everything.

368
00:24:32,791 --> 00:24:36,893
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is the Japanese version of the TurboGrafx.

369
00:24:38,114 --> 00:24:40,496
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you cannot play the HuCard games.

370
00:24:40,616 --> 00:24:41,837
[SPEAKER_03]: They are not compatible.

371
00:24:41,917 --> 00:24:48,241
[SPEAKER_03]: There's one converter that's supposed to work okay.

372
00:24:49,002 --> 00:24:49,742
[SPEAKER_03]: We could never get to work.

373
00:24:49,802 --> 00:24:51,863
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you find that one converter, it's super expensive.

374
00:24:51,903 --> 00:24:53,545
[SPEAKER_03]: So we may as well just buy the system.

375
00:24:54,265 --> 00:24:57,167
[SPEAKER_03]: So we got a Core Graphics so we could play our Japanese HuCards.

376
00:24:58,382 --> 00:24:59,022
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

377
00:24:59,062 --> 00:25:04,483
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, a lot of it is just like, it's here, we have the money right now, why don't we get it?

378
00:25:05,243 --> 00:25:09,824
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Dan was working at GameStop and then GameCrazy, so when he knew stuff that come out, he'd be like, let's get it.

379
00:25:10,704 --> 00:25:18,946
[SPEAKER_03]: And when the PS3 came out, he had just quit GameStop, but he had put in his pre-order as manager, so he was first in line.

380
00:25:19,646 --> 00:25:20,426
[SPEAKER_03]: So he went and got it.

381
00:25:20,546 --> 00:25:24,147
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Discover gave us a $100 credit back because he had spent so much.

382
00:25:24,427 --> 00:25:24,647
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

383
00:25:24,807 --> 00:25:26,148
[SPEAKER_03]: So he basically got our $700 system for $600.

384
00:25:26,188 --> 00:25:26,268
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

385
00:25:28,428 --> 00:25:29,309
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and we still have it.

386
00:25:29,829 --> 00:25:31,550
[SPEAKER_03]: Our original PS3 works just fine.

387
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:37,113
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's just one of those things where your collection just kept growing and growing and growing and then it suddenly needed its own room because you're just both gamers.

388
00:25:37,133 --> 00:25:38,254
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder what that is behind you.

389
00:25:38,294 --> 00:25:39,755
[SPEAKER_03]: Will you grab me that black and blue case, please?

390
00:25:39,915 --> 00:25:40,876
[SPEAKER_08]: The black and blue case.

391
00:25:40,916 --> 00:25:41,096
[SPEAKER_08]: Hold on.

392
00:25:41,116 --> 00:25:41,476
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm looking for it.

393
00:25:41,496 --> 00:25:42,317
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to see what it is.

394
00:25:43,137 --> 00:25:47,080
[SPEAKER_03]: Because keep in mind, we also have a lot of stuff just packed up in... Oh, it's empty, isn't it?

395
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,481
[SPEAKER_08]: It feels empty.

396
00:25:48,621 --> 00:25:49,241
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, then it's empty.

397
00:25:49,301 --> 00:25:49,601
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm right.

398
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:52,383
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we've just got stuff packed up in...

399
00:25:54,344 --> 00:26:14,776
[SPEAKER_03]: bags and things old systems like I think one of the things behind you is an Xbox in that black and red case there that's where we keep the Neo Geo like the AVS cartridge Neo Geo and someone just sold us a Neo CD for like 100 bucks with a bunch of games so I mean like I said when we get these things they sort of fall into our lap

400
00:26:15,818 --> 00:26:17,961
[SPEAKER_08]: Where do you think all this stuff's going to end up someday?

401
00:26:18,341 --> 00:26:20,263
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you see yourselves hanging on to this forever?

402
00:26:20,563 --> 00:26:21,965
[SPEAKER_08]: Or what's going to happen?

403
00:26:22,025 --> 00:26:23,526
[SPEAKER_08]: Passing it on to children?

404
00:26:23,727 --> 00:26:26,389
[SPEAKER_03]: Dan's talked about selling it a couple of times.

405
00:26:27,771 --> 00:26:31,535
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we get talking about it and neither of us can really see ourselves parting with it.

406
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:32,195
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

407
00:26:48,714 --> 00:26:53,477
[SPEAKER_03]: It really just sort of happened up there with all the Bimani stuff when we really got into music games.

408
00:26:54,577 --> 00:27:00,480
[SPEAKER_03]: We just kept getting controllers and systems and, oh, American Beatmania 2DX, let's get it!

409
00:27:01,121 --> 00:27:07,244
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, the guitar freaks, we both had to have a guitar and then I found the drum kit really cheap.

410
00:27:08,104 --> 00:27:10,966
[SPEAKER_03]: from not Toys and Joys, but it was another importer.

411
00:27:11,926 --> 00:27:15,389
[SPEAKER_08]: Speaking randomly of American 2DX, I want to throw this out here.

412
00:27:15,429 --> 00:27:20,532
[SPEAKER_08]: It wasn't news that made the earlier show, but Naoki runs a Facebook, and it really is him.

413
00:27:20,612 --> 00:27:21,933
[SPEAKER_08]: I asked him when I saw him at E3.

414
00:27:22,313 --> 00:27:32,759
[SPEAKER_08]: It's his Facebook, and he was actually asking questions about music games on there this week, and he actually said, like, you know, what type of music game is your favorite, and would you want to see another karaoke type of game?

415
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,301
[SPEAKER_08]: And overwhelmingly, it seemed the response was like,

416
00:27:35,561 --> 00:27:37,503
[SPEAKER_08]: No, we don't need any more karaoke games.

417
00:27:37,623 --> 00:27:41,306
[SPEAKER_08]: And everybody was like, 2DX, 2DX, 2DX, bring 2DX on the PS3.

418
00:27:41,667 --> 00:27:43,448
[SPEAKER_08]: Please release on the PS3.

419
00:27:43,528 --> 00:27:49,654
[SPEAKER_08]: Because if they did release it, it would be region-free, where even if they released it in Japan, you know you're going to have tons of people over here buying it.

420
00:27:49,854 --> 00:27:50,415
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, hell yes.

421
00:27:50,615 --> 00:27:52,336
[SPEAKER_08]: That might be part of the reason it's getting held up.

422
00:27:52,677 --> 00:27:57,701
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe they're having problems with music licenses or what have you, although I don't think they license a lot of music for Beatmania anymore.

423
00:27:58,022 --> 00:27:58,322
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

424
00:27:58,703 --> 00:28:03,444
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, um... I actually answered on the thing, too.

425
00:28:03,564 --> 00:28:03,824
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you?

426
00:28:03,944 --> 00:28:05,125
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was reading other people's responses.

427
00:28:05,145 --> 00:28:05,565
[SPEAKER_03]: They were funny.

428
00:28:05,665 --> 00:28:06,625
[SPEAKER_08]: I did, but I got in late.

429
00:28:09,446 --> 00:28:10,946
[SPEAKER_03]: But, yeah, the pink biscuit's up there.

430
00:28:10,966 --> 00:28:14,027
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we bought a friend of ours, Parapara.

431
00:28:14,107 --> 00:28:14,807
[SPEAKER_03]: Parapara.

432
00:28:15,348 --> 00:28:18,609
[SPEAKER_03]: Up at the very top, to the left of Samba de Amigo in Keyboard Mania.

433
00:28:19,369 --> 00:28:22,930
[SPEAKER_08]: Which soon The Connect is going to be taking the place of some of that type of stuff.

434
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:24,210
[SPEAKER_08]: It's funny how technology's come.

435
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:25,370
[SPEAKER_03]: I really want a Parapara game.

436
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:26,331
[SPEAKER_03]: I want a tech Parapara game.

437
00:28:29,152 --> 00:28:33,173
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, our other thing, too, is that Dan and I like playing games with good controllers.

438
00:28:33,733 --> 00:28:35,414
[SPEAKER_03]: We love controllers.

439
00:28:36,494 --> 00:28:38,914
[SPEAKER_08]: What other good, like, back-in-the-day topics can we talk about?

440
00:28:39,315 --> 00:28:41,855
[SPEAKER_08]: We can talk about, try to remember the first time we all met.

441
00:28:42,375 --> 00:28:45,696
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if I totally remember the very first time I met DarkSakura.

442
00:28:45,716 --> 00:28:45,916
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember.

443
00:28:45,976 --> 00:28:46,816
[SPEAKER_03]: It was at Milpitas, wasn't it?

444
00:28:46,836 --> 00:28:48,497
[SPEAKER_03]: It was at Milpitas Golf Line playing Parapara.

445
00:28:48,737 --> 00:28:48,937
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah?

446
00:28:49,077 --> 00:28:49,897
[SPEAKER_03]: And you showed up with Jessica.

447
00:28:50,549 --> 00:28:52,191
[SPEAKER_08]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

448
00:29:07,253 --> 00:29:13,596
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of people don't know that is that she and I actually played our very first game of DDR together.

449
00:29:13,776 --> 00:29:19,519
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's kind of funny because we both ended up taking... We actually went... And I think this is kind of common knowledge now.

450
00:29:19,539 --> 00:29:20,640
[SPEAKER_08]: We had a spat for many years.

451
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:23,482
[SPEAKER_08]: We had a personal disagreement that just got way out of control.

452
00:29:23,522 --> 00:29:24,622
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was really ugly.

453
00:29:24,742 --> 00:29:26,143
[SPEAKER_08]: We've worked our stuff out since then.

454
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:29,184
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a pleasant friendship and everything.

455
00:29:29,204 --> 00:29:32,086
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think it's great that she's back on Under Sedation Live.

456
00:29:32,106 --> 00:29:33,867
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know her and Travis have always had a really funny...

457
00:29:34,167 --> 00:29:35,407
[SPEAKER_08]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

458
00:29:57,594 --> 00:30:14,937
[SPEAKER_08]: DDR Freak Radio was a project and it was always I haven't talked about this a lot but you know we're in the marathon part of the show we don't expect a lot of people to listen to when DDR Freak Radio kind of first came out we were at least I think you kind of knew about both projects we couldn't say anything because you kind of had to walk like this delicate line right

459
00:30:15,362 --> 00:30:16,923
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is what I was doing for a long time.

460
00:30:30,888 --> 00:30:31,688
[SPEAKER_08]: our real name

461
00:31:03,904 --> 00:31:07,005
[SPEAKER_08]: I think a lot of people don't realize that... This is Alex.

462
00:31:07,385 --> 00:31:08,005
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Alex.

463
00:31:08,205 --> 00:31:08,665
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you doing?

464
00:31:08,685 --> 00:31:09,286
[SPEAKER_03]: Come in real quick.

465
00:31:09,306 --> 00:31:09,686
[SPEAKER_03]: Say hi to everybody.

466
00:31:09,706 --> 00:31:11,206
[SPEAKER_08]: We're actually broadcasting our marathon.

467
00:31:11,226 --> 00:31:12,226
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if Dan told you.

468
00:31:12,266 --> 00:31:14,167
[SPEAKER_08]: We're on a marathon episode of our show right now.

469
00:31:14,507 --> 00:31:15,007
[SPEAKER_08]: Marathon.

470
00:31:15,027 --> 00:31:16,107
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a marathon.

471
00:31:16,447 --> 00:31:17,208
[SPEAKER_08]: How are you doing, Alex?

472
00:31:17,828 --> 00:31:18,508
[SPEAKER_05]: Doing pretty good.

473
00:31:18,608 --> 00:31:21,449
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have an online... You've got to get real close to the... These mics aren't very sensitive.

474
00:31:21,469 --> 00:31:23,309
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have an online name you use that you want people to know?

475
00:31:24,029 --> 00:31:27,530
[SPEAKER_05]: I suppose you can tell people that I use the name Five Gears.

476
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:28,550
[SPEAKER_08]: Five Gears.

477
00:31:29,011 --> 00:31:29,771
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, Five Gears.

478
00:31:29,811 --> 00:31:30,571
[SPEAKER_08]: What kind of games do you play?

479
00:31:31,815 --> 00:31:33,436
[SPEAKER_05]: Mostly single player today.

480
00:31:33,917 --> 00:31:35,998
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't afford to play Xbox Live.

481
00:31:36,018 --> 00:31:37,660
[SPEAKER_08]: I hear they're jacking up the price ten bucks.

482
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,580
[SPEAKER_08]: We just talked about that earlier.

483
00:31:40,002 --> 00:31:45,346
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's... Well, I don't usually play online anymore.

484
00:31:46,627 --> 00:31:48,789
[SPEAKER_06]: But when I did, it was a lot of Halo.

485
00:31:49,029 --> 00:31:53,372
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm probably going to have to, depending on how Reach goes, because I'm going to try that out.

486
00:31:54,753 --> 00:31:56,295
[SPEAKER_08]: Not that it's here or anything.

487
00:31:56,475 --> 00:31:59,097
[SPEAKER_08]: Just, you know, you're going to try it someday.

488
00:31:59,117 --> 00:31:59,537
[SPEAKER_06]: Legally.

489
00:31:59,577 --> 00:31:59,958
[SPEAKER_06]: Legally.

490
00:32:00,698 --> 00:32:01,199
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, of course.

491
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:01,839
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.

492
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:06,805
[SPEAKER_06]: But when I try it out, I'll see if it's worth actually playing.

493
00:32:07,866 --> 00:32:12,310
[SPEAKER_06]: And playing online with friends is really the only reason why I ever did it in the first place.

494
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:14,392
[SPEAKER_06]: I have all kinds of online games on PC.

495
00:32:15,554 --> 00:32:16,254
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, hey, hey.

496
00:32:17,375 --> 00:32:17,896
[SPEAKER_08]: Not gonna lie.

497
00:32:18,777 --> 00:32:19,738
[SPEAKER_06]: World of Warcraft.

498
00:32:19,798 --> 00:32:20,579
[SPEAKER_06]: I used to play that.

499
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:21,571
[SPEAKER_08]: I still do.

500
00:32:21,931 --> 00:32:25,595
[SPEAKER_08]: I was talking about the Cataclysm beta earlier in the show, playing that a little bit.

501
00:32:25,695 --> 00:32:28,297
[SPEAKER_08]: When are you going to get the needle out of your arm, man?

502
00:32:28,577 --> 00:32:30,840
[SPEAKER_08]: When my friends stop playing, because honestly, that's the only reason I play.

503
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,260
[SPEAKER_08]: No, really.

504
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:31,700
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it is.

505
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:35,524
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're my real-life friends and people I know in the Bay Area and Allen.

506
00:32:35,744 --> 00:32:38,347
[SPEAKER_08]: We all play together, and it's just kind of like the thing now.

507
00:32:38,627 --> 00:32:44,553
[SPEAKER_08]: I could give a shit about the game itself a lot of days, but it's just kind of the way we all hang out.

508
00:32:44,653 --> 00:32:45,873
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of nerdy, but awesome.

509
00:32:45,893 --> 00:32:47,034
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no, that's fine.

510
00:32:47,154 --> 00:32:51,996
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it used to be, for me, it was all about just playing first-person shooters online with people.

511
00:32:52,696 --> 00:32:54,737
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that's what my college buddies and I used to do.

512
00:32:54,757 --> 00:32:55,977
[SPEAKER_08]: We used to play Quake online.

513
00:32:56,017 --> 00:32:58,738
[SPEAKER_08]: We used to play Halo 2 for a long time.

514
00:32:59,158 --> 00:32:59,798
[SPEAKER_08]: All that good stuff.

515
00:33:00,099 --> 00:33:05,000
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, no, for me right now, if I do play online at all, it's Bad Company 2 on PC.

516
00:33:05,381 --> 00:33:05,621
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

517
00:33:05,881 --> 00:33:07,961
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, you should be voicing movie trailers, just so you know.

518
00:33:08,302 --> 00:33:09,342
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's just all just make voices.

519
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:11,211
[SPEAKER_05]: Another Solid Snake impression?

520
00:33:11,952 --> 00:33:16,176
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm getting my impressions mixed up.

521
00:33:19,719 --> 00:33:22,202
[SPEAKER_08]: Alan's looking at chat and they think he's Solid Snake?

522
00:33:22,802 --> 00:33:23,103
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.

523
00:33:23,603 --> 00:33:24,864
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

524
00:33:25,105 --> 00:33:27,767
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want to look at chat and read us some comments, there's a mic in there that's hot.

525
00:33:27,787 --> 00:33:29,629
[SPEAKER_08]: You just have to be loud enough for us to hear you back here.

526
00:33:31,653 --> 00:33:32,433
[SPEAKER_03]: He's going in there.

527
00:33:32,493 --> 00:33:39,677
[SPEAKER_08]: He's going in there to see if... I feel bad because we've been neglecting the chat room, but we're having memories here.

528
00:33:42,118 --> 00:33:42,618
[SPEAKER_08]: Where was I?

529
00:33:42,638 --> 00:33:47,300
[SPEAKER_08]: I was talking about the conflict that Iguana Girl and I had, but we're cool now.

530
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,201
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I was talking about... Yeah, now she hates me.

531
00:33:49,641 --> 00:33:52,222
[SPEAKER_08]: Well... I can't give a shit.

532
00:33:52,622 --> 00:33:54,203
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm trying to stay with the positive.

533
00:33:54,223 --> 00:33:54,663
[SPEAKER_08]: I am.

534
00:33:54,823 --> 00:33:58,465
[SPEAKER_08]: But I was talking about the conflict, but then, okay, the day, there was a New Year's,

535
00:33:59,505 --> 00:34:01,067
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

536
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,763
[SPEAKER_08]: from Orange Lounge Studios for DDR Free Radio.

537
00:34:18,304 --> 00:34:24,230
[SPEAKER_08]: That was like the Nintendo and Sega logos appearing at the same time when you first boot up some of the like F-Zero and some of those.

538
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:24,950
[SPEAKER_08]: That was a huge event.

539
00:34:25,191 --> 00:34:25,992
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

540
00:34:26,612 --> 00:34:27,894
[SPEAKER_08]: But a lot of people didn't know the difference.

541
00:34:27,914 --> 00:34:28,614
[SPEAKER_03]: We did the New Year's.

542
00:34:28,634 --> 00:34:29,095
[SPEAKER_08]: But it was huge.

543
00:34:29,215 --> 00:34:30,817
[SPEAKER_03]: The New Year's Bimani Countdown.

544
00:34:30,977 --> 00:34:31,157
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

545
00:34:32,138 --> 00:34:33,279
[SPEAKER_08]: But it was good.

546
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,021
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm glad that all worked out.

547
00:34:35,622 --> 00:34:35,942
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow.

548
00:34:36,743 --> 00:34:36,983
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

549
00:34:37,003 --> 00:34:38,525
[SPEAKER_08]: Didn't mean to get off on those topics.

550
00:34:39,005 --> 00:34:40,245
[SPEAKER_08]: We were back on talking about how we first met.

551
00:34:40,265 --> 00:34:42,386
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's grab a box of games.

552
00:34:42,826 --> 00:34:48,567
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I got to Dan and me meeting and me moving out here and us, our children multiplying.

553
00:34:49,207 --> 00:34:50,407
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, our games multiplying.

554
00:34:54,368 --> 00:35:04,729
[SPEAKER_03]: But I really didn't though get my own group of friends until I started going to Golfland and playing in the arcades there because I was playing DDR at home already and Beatmania.

555
00:35:04,809 --> 00:35:07,610
[SPEAKER_03]: I had BM98 if you remember the old emulator.

556
00:35:08,411 --> 00:35:08,751
[SPEAKER_03]: One of Us!

557
00:35:27,132 --> 00:35:27,392
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

558
00:35:28,212 --> 00:35:31,915
[SPEAKER_03]: And then everything kind of exploded and our group just got huge.

559
00:35:31,975 --> 00:35:37,780
[SPEAKER_03]: And I had a birthday party at Golfland on the floor in front of the Fourth Mix.

560
00:35:38,502 --> 00:36:01,151
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember the day the fourth mix hit Golfland I actually called in sick well I was already I was like legitimately sick I called in because I was sick to work and then I found out that RVGL got fourth mix that day and I was like I'm going I don't even care that I'm sick I'm going I'm gonna go be one of the first people to play that machine and I was sick as a dog but I played it and I probably gave you all cooties although I do remember that I was the first person of us to play a max

561
00:36:02,735 --> 00:36:03,156
[SPEAKER_08]: How'd that work?

562
00:36:03,196 --> 00:36:04,016
[SPEAKER_03]: I was in San Diego.

563
00:36:05,117 --> 00:36:05,237
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh.

564
00:36:05,638 --> 00:36:10,962
[SPEAKER_03]: And the arcade there was like one of the few in SoCal that had it.

565
00:36:11,923 --> 00:36:12,384
[SPEAKER_09]: Very cool.

566
00:36:12,644 --> 00:36:12,864
[SPEAKER_03]: So.

567
00:36:14,345 --> 00:36:16,887
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, those Golf Land Nights used to be something else.

568
00:36:17,188 --> 00:36:17,608
[SPEAKER_08]: There they are!

569
00:36:18,068 --> 00:36:18,849
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh-oh, what'd you find?

570
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:22,312
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura's reaching for, what is this, Saturn games?

571
00:36:22,352 --> 00:36:23,053
[SPEAKER_08]: Dreamcast games.

572
00:36:23,593 --> 00:36:23,973
[SPEAKER_03]: Wrong!

573
00:36:24,033 --> 00:36:24,614
[SPEAKER_03]: TurboGrafx.

574
00:36:26,095 --> 00:36:26,736
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, snap.

[SPEAKER_03]: R-Type.

576
00:36:30,703 --> 00:36:31,803
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, I do have Space Harrier.

577
00:36:32,984 --> 00:36:33,924
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to Fantasy Zone.

578
00:36:34,744 --> 00:36:35,084
[SPEAKER_03]: Get ready.

579
00:36:35,964 --> 00:36:37,325
[SPEAKER_08]: 40 bucks, according to the price tag.

580
00:36:37,425 --> 00:36:38,005
[SPEAKER_03]: When it was new.

581
00:36:38,865 --> 00:36:43,566
[SPEAKER_03]: Pac-Land, Ys 1 and 2, here's my Japanese games.

[SPEAKER_03]: Twin Bee!

583
00:36:48,148 --> 00:36:49,928
[SPEAKER_03]: Some weird, bizarre shooter called Eldis.

584
00:36:54,029 --> 00:36:56,270
[SPEAKER_03]: Garou Densetsu 2, which is Fatal Fury.

585
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:57,410
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's just Fatal Fury, right?

586
00:36:58,052 --> 00:36:58,793
[SPEAKER_03]: P.O.P.O.

587
00:36:59,833 --> 00:37:00,294
[SPEAKER_03]: P.O.P.O.

588
00:37:01,995 --> 00:37:03,676
[SPEAKER_03]: Strider, which we actually cannot play this game.

589
00:37:04,297 --> 00:37:04,617
[SPEAKER_08]: Why is that?

590
00:37:04,637 --> 00:37:05,418
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's sealed.

591
00:37:05,498 --> 00:37:06,698
[SPEAKER_08]: That might be one reason why you can't play it.

592
00:37:06,718 --> 00:37:07,279
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's not sealed.

593
00:37:07,299 --> 00:37:08,420
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just... Oh, it looks like it.

594
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:09,781
[SPEAKER_03]: In sticky paper.

595
00:37:10,081 --> 00:37:10,641
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

596
00:37:10,822 --> 00:37:15,245
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we do not have a system that we can use an arcade card in.

597
00:37:16,005 --> 00:37:16,146
[SPEAKER_03]: The...

598
00:37:18,727 --> 00:37:24,171
[SPEAKER_03]: One system that I really want... And listeners, if you want to band together and do this for me, I'll be your best friend forever.

599
00:37:25,332 --> 00:37:27,654
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really trying to get a Duo RX.

600
00:37:28,175 --> 00:37:30,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it has the arcade card built into it.

601
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:33,239
[SPEAKER_03]: They're about $150.

602
00:37:33,319 --> 00:37:35,861
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you can get them pretty affordable still.

603
00:37:36,562 --> 00:37:36,742
[SPEAKER_03]: But...

604
00:37:38,303 --> 00:37:39,504
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

605
00:38:01,761 --> 00:38:03,101
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys made websites together.

606
00:38:03,121 --> 00:38:03,941
[SPEAKER_08]: That's so adorable.

607
00:38:03,981 --> 00:38:04,962
[SPEAKER_08]: Back on AOL.

608
00:38:05,262 --> 00:38:07,322
[SPEAKER_08]: Alan, why are we making websites together?

609
00:38:07,402 --> 00:38:08,342
[SPEAKER_08]: It's so precious.

610
00:38:09,362 --> 00:38:12,043
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called Neo... And I want to know if anyone remembers this.

611
00:38:12,063 --> 00:38:12,883
[SPEAKER_03]: He's shaking his head at me like, shut up.

612
00:38:12,903 --> 00:38:14,023
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to know if anyone remembers this.

613
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:16,024
[SPEAKER_03]: It was called Neo Strider's Strider Zone.

614
00:38:17,684 --> 00:38:18,824
[SPEAKER_03]: And I touched up all of his graphics.

615
00:38:19,304 --> 00:38:23,625
[SPEAKER_10]: When I was a junior in high school, I had a Sailor Venus fan page on GeoCities.

616
00:38:23,885 --> 00:38:25,105
[SPEAKER_10]: You fag.

617
00:38:25,165 --> 00:38:25,485
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

618
00:38:25,705 --> 00:38:29,786
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, my first cosplay was Sailor Venus.

619
00:38:30,686 --> 00:38:31,506
[SPEAKER_10]: She's the best one.

620
00:38:33,367 --> 00:38:34,247
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's this.

621
00:38:37,449 --> 00:38:40,630
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the Holy Grail of the Castlevania.

622
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:48,373
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm surprised you don't have this framed with laser beams that just cut you like the Resident Evil movie when you try to touch it.

623
00:38:48,513 --> 00:38:52,335
[SPEAKER_08]: Or like Catherine Zeta-Jones in Entrapment trying to go through the laser beams.

624
00:38:52,695 --> 00:38:55,116
[SPEAKER_03]: The only thing I can read on this is Die Something Custom.

625
00:38:57,347 --> 00:38:58,028
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a tank game.

626
00:38:58,348 --> 00:39:02,171
[SPEAKER_10]: The port that just came out on the Wii, does it look like this or is it different?

627
00:39:02,692 --> 00:39:03,852
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't tried it on the Wii yet.

628
00:39:03,933 --> 00:39:04,513
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't got it.

629
00:39:06,655 --> 00:39:07,415
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't bought it either.

630
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,061
[SPEAKER_03]: All I know of those is die.

631
00:39:14,982 --> 00:39:20,967
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, die!

632
00:39:21,107 --> 00:39:22,588
[SPEAKER_03]: I see anime girlies on that one.

633
00:39:22,768 --> 00:39:23,509
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the one right there?

634
00:39:23,669 --> 00:39:25,951
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Valus 3.

635
00:39:28,021 --> 00:39:29,783
[SPEAKER_03]: and then, yeah, the rest of these are PlayStation.

636
00:39:30,504 --> 00:39:35,869
[SPEAKER_03]: Tempest X. I think we got a... These characters look familiar.

637
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:38,092
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we got an American version of this at some point.

638
00:39:38,112 --> 00:39:38,372
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, we did.

639
00:39:38,833 --> 00:39:42,657
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are the N-A-M-C-O games on PlayStation that were all the Namco stuff.

640
00:39:42,677 --> 00:39:44,919
[SPEAKER_08]: And then wasn't there like a trademark symbol game that's really rare?

641
00:39:44,939 --> 00:39:45,580
[SPEAKER_08]: In Japan.

642
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:46,581
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a restricted symbol.

643
00:39:47,021 --> 00:39:48,423
[SPEAKER_03]: And someone is supposed to be getting it for me.

644
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:49,063
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.

645
00:39:49,823 --> 00:39:50,884
[SPEAKER_08]: What's in it that's so special?

646
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:21,039
[SPEAKER_03]: Pac-Man, Galaga, Pole Position, Bosconian, Rally X, New Rally X, and Toy Pop Xevious, Grappler, Super Pac-Man This was the one that was the hardest to find, was the A. Because I wanted Super Pac-Man.

647
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,702
[SPEAKER_03]: Mappy, Grabda, and Dragon Buster.

648
00:40:23,742 --> 00:40:24,783
[SPEAKER_03]: You know we covered that story?

649
00:40:25,403 --> 00:40:27,685
[SPEAKER_03]: That said, oh, Grabda, we're gonna get it remixed.

650
00:40:27,745 --> 00:40:29,667
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, dude, it already came out in the US.

651
00:40:31,569 --> 00:40:34,491
[SPEAKER_03]: You could play this on the PS3, because they're playing PS1 games.

652
00:40:34,531 --> 00:40:36,253
[SPEAKER_03]: We had to get M as a greatest hits.

653
00:40:36,853 --> 00:40:40,616
[SPEAKER_10]: Dragon Spirit, Pac-Mania, and Legend of Valkyrie

654
00:41:06,545 --> 00:41:06,766
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

655
00:41:16,772 --> 00:41:17,472
[SPEAKER_08]: That was a fun game.

656
00:41:43,826 --> 00:41:47,232
[SPEAKER_08]: Why is it... What do you think made you such a gaming fan?

657
00:41:47,372 --> 00:41:53,782
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, why do you think you play video games and you love the games and the gaming culture, like, so much?

658
00:41:55,643 --> 00:41:56,945
[SPEAKER_03]: I practically grew up with it.

659
00:41:57,005 --> 00:41:58,546
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, seriously.

660
00:41:59,347 --> 00:42:01,850
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember playing the Atari 2600 when I was a little kid.

661
00:42:02,911 --> 00:42:05,474
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember the Odyssey.

662
00:42:06,715 --> 00:42:07,616
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just always been there.

663
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:11,961
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's always been a fun and kind of integral part of my life.

664
00:42:11,981 --> 00:42:13,583
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope that doesn't sound too sad.

665
00:42:14,243 --> 00:42:15,885
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's just always been there.

666
00:42:17,126 --> 00:42:19,908
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think it's that because my story is somewhat similar.

667
00:42:19,928 --> 00:42:25,151
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't like to go outside that much because I had asthma and allergies and everything and that and I hated everybody.

668
00:42:25,851 --> 00:42:27,432
[SPEAKER_03]: So, no I didn't.

669
00:42:28,092 --> 00:42:30,974
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was my form of escape.

670
00:42:31,014 --> 00:42:33,075
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, my mom would play Nintendo with me.

671
00:42:33,755 --> 00:42:34,816
[SPEAKER_03]: She'd play the Nintendo.

672
00:42:35,196 --> 00:42:41,040
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when she was asking me for Christmas one time what to get my brothers, a Genesis or a Super Nintendo, I told her a Super Nintendo and then I played it the whole time.

673
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:47,123
[SPEAKER_03]: So, but I mean, it's always been kind of, it's been sort of a bonding thing in my family a little bit.

674
00:42:47,563 --> 00:42:57,249
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when I was living in Alabama and playing games, I could play some things over the dial-up connection with friends in California.

675
00:42:58,210 --> 00:43:05,534
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it just was my way of kind of getting out of how crappy Alabama was to live in.

676
00:43:05,934 --> 00:43:06,674
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, at the time.

677
00:43:07,054 --> 00:43:08,255
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not saying Alabama's crappy.

678
00:43:08,675 --> 00:43:09,355
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't get me wrong.

679
00:43:09,455 --> 00:43:11,676
[SPEAKER_03]: I love my home state, but I'd never want to live there again.

680
00:43:12,196 --> 00:43:19,678
[SPEAKER_03]: I just did not like being stuck with everyone expecting me to be one way when I was clearly something other than what they wanted me to be.

681
00:43:20,359 --> 00:43:23,800
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I would just play games all the time and kind of forget about it and then...

682
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:27,842
[SPEAKER_03]: It instead expanded my life.

683
00:43:28,242 --> 00:43:30,564
[SPEAKER_03]: I met my husband because I loved anime and video games.

684
00:43:31,205 --> 00:43:31,885
[SPEAKER_03]: I moved out here.

685
00:43:31,945 --> 00:43:33,026
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a happy life.

686
00:43:33,206 --> 00:43:34,507
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a whole bunch of Transformers.

687
00:43:36,028 --> 00:43:42,113
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, it's really, I think it's opened some doors in my otherwise lack of a social life.

688
00:43:42,974 --> 00:43:45,235
[SPEAKER_03]: And now I think I'm a lot more social than I used to be.

689
00:43:45,355 --> 00:43:47,377
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would say video games have a big part of it.

690
00:43:48,844 --> 00:43:55,108
[SPEAKER_08]: I wouldn't say that... I don't know if it was like a social thing because I would like to think I was still like kind of social when I was a kid.

691
00:43:55,128 --> 00:43:56,329
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I had friends and all that stuff.

692
00:43:56,369 --> 00:44:01,152
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think like growing up especially, I was... You know, my brother and sister were so much older than I was.

693
00:44:01,192 --> 00:44:02,773
[SPEAKER_08]: My brother is 14 years older.

694
00:44:02,833 --> 00:44:04,334
[SPEAKER_08]: My sister is 16 years older than I am.

695
00:44:04,734 --> 00:44:07,736
[SPEAKER_08]: And my parents then are quite a bit older.

696
00:44:07,816 --> 00:44:09,477
[SPEAKER_08]: My mom was 37 when she had me.

697
00:44:09,558 --> 00:44:17,383
[SPEAKER_08]: So by the time I was around, not only did I have kind of the only child syndrome thing going on, but my parents had kind of done it all with my brother and sister.

698
00:44:17,423 --> 00:44:17,923
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, they didn't...

699
00:44:18,123 --> 00:44:18,683
[SPEAKER_08]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

700
00:44:48,155 --> 00:44:53,479
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I think the Commodore 64 kind of enabled me to gaming, even though we had an Atari 2600 that I played and all that other stuff.

701
00:44:53,839 --> 00:45:05,749
[SPEAKER_08]: But I just found myself like I was really able to entertain myself by like writing these little programs or typing them in for magazines and therefore feeling accomplished and, you know, trying to get these accomplishments in games and so forth.

702
00:45:05,789 --> 00:45:08,591
[SPEAKER_08]: And the games were sort of something I was able to get into.

703
00:45:09,071 --> 00:45:26,962
[SPEAKER_08]: and I felt like it was something I was kind of good at and that I was able to kind of like follow the scene sorry I'm just stretching I was able to like follow the scene pretty good and whereas like a lot of kids were really good at football or baseball or sports and things that I wasn't so good at I was good at games and I could kick their butt in any like video game and that was always like kind of cool

704
00:45:27,242 --> 00:45:27,542
[SPEAKER_08]: Busta Groove

705
00:45:47,293 --> 00:45:50,515
[SPEAKER_08]: So it was Busta Groove that actually got me into games.

706
00:45:50,935 --> 00:45:51,755
[SPEAKER_08]: In the music games.

707
00:45:51,895 --> 00:45:55,337
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know Jamie hates that because that's not what they were called, really.

708
00:45:55,777 --> 00:45:56,698
[SPEAKER_08]: But I didn't know any better.

709
00:45:57,058 --> 00:45:59,940
[SPEAKER_08]: Being somebody who didn't really follow the import gaming.

710
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:01,440
[SPEAKER_01]: It was funny to laugh about it.

711
00:46:02,401 --> 00:46:05,562
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're trying to get the mics untangled as we move back to the studio.

712
00:46:06,983 --> 00:46:08,124
[SPEAKER_08]: We're playing mic roulette here.

713
00:46:09,136 --> 00:46:09,216
[SPEAKER_03]: D.D.R.

714
00:46:32,618 --> 00:46:37,881
[SPEAKER_08]: If you guys want to ask us some questions in chat, chat.orangelantradio.com Any types of follow-up or what have you.

715
00:46:38,301 --> 00:46:40,842
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm finally able to look at chat here again.

716
00:46:42,523 --> 00:46:43,723
[SPEAKER_08]: By the way, the G line should be up.

717
00:46:43,743 --> 00:46:44,164
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm trying.

718
00:46:44,224 --> 00:46:45,284
[SPEAKER_08]: So you should be able to get back in.

719
00:46:45,324 --> 00:46:46,445
[SPEAKER_08]: So let me know if you have success.

720
00:46:47,605 --> 00:46:48,045
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

721
00:46:49,506 --> 00:46:53,828
[SPEAKER_08]: Blaze in our chatroom says, My mom used to whoop my butt in Donkey Kong Country on the Super Nintendo.

722
00:46:53,848 --> 00:46:56,709
[SPEAKER_08]: See, my parents were never really into games at all.

723
00:46:56,990 --> 00:46:58,790
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

724
00:46:58,830 --> 00:46:59,291
[SPEAKER_08]: My dad...

725
00:47:00,208 --> 00:47:02,992
[SPEAKER_08]: I think would try, but I don't think he was really into it.

726
00:47:03,012 --> 00:47:06,817
[SPEAKER_08]: He'd rather just take me mini-golfing or something and then I'd want to play games the whole time we were there.

727
00:47:06,837 --> 00:47:07,698
[SPEAKER_08]: I wouldn't want to really golf.

728
00:47:10,939 --> 00:47:11,339
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

729
00:47:11,419 --> 00:47:13,841
[SPEAKER_08]: Toagak says Bust a Move is a game in the US.

730
00:47:13,901 --> 00:47:15,062
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that was the whole problem.

731
00:47:15,142 --> 00:47:17,043
[SPEAKER_08]: It was Bust a Move was Puzzle Bobble.

732
00:47:17,404 --> 00:47:17,644
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

733
00:47:17,904 --> 00:47:20,286
[SPEAKER_03]: Which I think Puzzle Bobble is much cuter.

734
00:47:20,466 --> 00:47:21,527
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it is.

735
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:23,708
[SPEAKER_08]: So, all right.

736
00:47:25,049 --> 00:47:27,391
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think we're going to take, let's take like a quick, quick break.

737
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:32,255
[SPEAKER_08]: And when we come back, we'll do some more news stories that we have listed and some of the other chat topics we have.

738
00:47:32,275 --> 00:47:32,635
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

739
00:47:32,655 --> 00:47:33,215
[SPEAKER_08]: Does that sound good?

740
00:47:33,335 --> 00:47:35,037
[SPEAKER_08]: And we got to think about what we're going to do for food too.

741
00:47:35,817 --> 00:47:37,038
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we're going to do a take and bake.

742
00:47:37,098 --> 00:47:37,238
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

743
00:47:37,258 --> 00:47:38,279
[SPEAKER_08]: What time do those places close?

744
00:47:39,221 --> 00:47:40,842
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see you next time.

745
00:47:59,671 --> 00:48:00,271
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll be right back.

746
00:48:33,334 --> 00:48:34,255
[SPEAKER_08]: 4 1⁄2 hours in of our show tonight.

747
00:48:58,826 --> 00:48:59,967
[SPEAKER_08]: We had our main show earlier.

748
00:49:00,527 --> 00:49:06,469
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're tuning in expecting to hear Loki and the usual bits and all that, that started at 2 and finished at like 5.30.

749
00:49:06,930 --> 00:49:09,291
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're kind of in the extra stuff now.

750
00:49:09,551 --> 00:49:11,532
[SPEAKER_08]: We're broadcasting all night long because we can.

751
00:49:12,052 --> 00:49:13,352
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks like a lot of you guys are joining us.

752
00:49:13,372 --> 00:49:18,835
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm looking at our chat room at chat.orangeentree.com which, yay, we're back in after all this time.

753
00:49:18,875 --> 00:49:19,535
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you guys.

754
00:49:20,335 --> 00:49:22,276
[SPEAKER_08]: And Rama keeps having to remind me it's Sunday.

755
00:49:22,476 --> 00:49:23,277
[SPEAKER_08]: Did I say it's Saturday?

756
00:49:23,297 --> 00:49:23,837
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, my bad.

757
00:49:24,157 --> 00:49:25,098
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know why.

758
00:49:25,138 --> 00:49:26,398
[SPEAKER_08]: I just really want it to be Saturday.

759
00:49:26,858 --> 00:49:27,879
[SPEAKER_10]: Because you have tomorrow off work.

760
00:49:28,399 --> 00:49:29,520
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura actually made a phone call.

761
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:30,181
[SPEAKER_08]: That's good to know.

762
00:49:30,201 --> 00:49:30,741
[SPEAKER_08]: I like that.

763
00:49:30,761 --> 00:49:31,862
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're doing what, pizza tonight?

764
00:49:54,901 --> 00:49:56,663
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, the food of gamers.

765
00:49:56,783 --> 00:50:00,748
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right, the food of gamers and the food of marathons, actually, all things considered.

766
00:50:01,169 --> 00:50:03,311
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, hopefully DarkSakura got this.

767
00:50:03,351 --> 00:50:05,694
[SPEAKER_08]: I sent out a second show role full of other stories.

768
00:50:05,734 --> 00:50:06,696
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully you saw that in your...

769
00:50:08,698 --> 00:50:09,038
[SPEAKER_08]: Email?

770
00:50:10,299 --> 00:50:11,679
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be a good question.

771
00:50:11,819 --> 00:50:12,259
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me see.

772
00:50:12,279 --> 00:50:13,000
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, take a look.

773
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:17,161
[SPEAKER_08]: Because we're going to do some more stories for you guys.

774
00:50:17,181 --> 00:50:19,562
[SPEAKER_08]: Some things that actually missed the show role originally.

775
00:50:20,322 --> 00:50:21,183
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll talk about those.

776
00:50:21,203 --> 00:50:23,624
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we got more classic games of the week coming up.

777
00:50:24,184 --> 00:50:27,785
[SPEAKER_08]: And we'll take some of your Facebook questions in the segment as well.

778
00:50:28,186 --> 00:50:31,147
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going to do Ask Orange Lounge, I think, while I'm gone in the next segment.

779
00:50:31,367 --> 00:50:32,727
[SPEAKER_08]: And some other stuff too.

780
00:50:32,747 --> 00:50:33,508
[SPEAKER_08]: Oops.

781
00:50:33,588 --> 00:50:35,428
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, how about...

782
00:50:37,609 --> 00:50:38,670
[SPEAKER_08]: More DDR music!

783
00:50:39,010 --> 00:50:40,910
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we heard enough of that during the break.

784
00:50:40,950 --> 00:50:41,611
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry about that, guys.

785
00:50:41,731 --> 00:50:42,571
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I only got one.

786
00:50:44,012 --> 00:50:45,012
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I know I sent you one.

787
00:50:45,052 --> 00:50:45,372
[SPEAKER_09]: Take a look.

788
00:50:45,492 --> 00:50:45,992
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, no.

789
00:50:46,112 --> 00:50:47,653
[SPEAKER_08]: It compressed.

790
00:50:47,673 --> 00:50:48,013
[SPEAKER_08]: There it is.

791
00:50:48,073 --> 00:50:48,393
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it.

792
00:50:49,194 --> 00:50:49,754
[SPEAKER_08]: Open up the attachment.

793
00:50:49,774 --> 00:50:49,934
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no.

794
00:50:49,994 --> 00:50:50,614
[SPEAKER_08]: Open up the attachment.

795
00:50:50,634 --> 00:50:50,834
[SPEAKER_08]: Down.

796
00:50:50,994 --> 00:50:51,294
[SPEAKER_08]: Down.

797
00:50:51,454 --> 00:50:51,875
[SPEAKER_08]: Supplement.

798
00:50:52,435 --> 00:50:52,675
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

799
00:50:53,035 --> 00:50:53,415
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.

800
00:50:53,435 --> 00:50:54,396
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to download it.

801
00:50:55,696 --> 00:50:56,036
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.

802
00:50:56,877 --> 00:50:57,537
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay.

803
00:50:58,517 --> 00:50:58,877
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay.

804
00:50:58,957 --> 00:51:00,478
[SPEAKER_08]: Does it let you click those links?

805
00:51:01,518 --> 00:51:01,598
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

806
00:51:01,658 --> 00:51:01,778
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh.

807
00:51:02,179 --> 00:51:02,379
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay.

808
00:51:02,519 --> 00:51:02,739
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

809
00:51:03,319 --> 00:51:04,259
[SPEAKER_08]: It's ugly, but it works.

810
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:05,500
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

811
00:51:06,932 --> 00:51:14,185
[SPEAKER_08]: And also, if you want to send us comments or whatever and chat along with us, chat.orangeloungeradio.com is the place to be.

812
00:51:14,946 --> 00:51:16,469
[SPEAKER_08]: So happy we found our way back in the chat.

813
00:51:17,671 --> 00:51:18,593
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, so DarkSakura!

814
00:51:21,027 --> 00:51:31,850
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, for firsties, for people who love Sonic Adventure, like me, on Xbox Live Arcade, it will be $10 as of September 15th.

815
00:51:32,530 --> 00:51:34,591
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's really, really sweet.

816
00:51:35,571 --> 00:51:44,354
[SPEAKER_03]: Sonic Adventure is probably one of my, in fact, the only probably good one of the three, you know, 3D ones, so I have to say that's pretty sweet.

817
00:51:45,394 --> 00:52:08,626
[SPEAKER_03]: and um apparently uh I just think this is funny and I want to read this from the article because I I snickered just now it's like we've contacted Sega to find out if the game will arrive on PSN on a similar timetable we also sent them an email with the subject line give us Seaman followed by a body of text which essentially read Seaman so

818
00:52:09,434 --> 00:52:11,395
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you going to be downloading this to check out and play?

819
00:52:11,455 --> 00:52:13,375
[SPEAKER_08]: Or are you like, screw this, I have the original.

820
00:52:13,475 --> 00:52:13,875
[SPEAKER_08]: Screw this game.

821
00:52:13,895 --> 00:52:15,396
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kind of screw this, I have the original.

822
00:52:15,676 --> 00:52:15,876
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

823
00:52:15,936 --> 00:52:17,437
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the same time, I would like to support it.

824
00:52:18,297 --> 00:52:21,858
[SPEAKER_10]: I sank so many hours into Sonic Adventure 2 for the Dreamcast.

825
00:52:21,918 --> 00:52:25,819
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's the one that had the little Tamagotchi Pokemon where you had your little babies.

826
00:52:26,619 --> 00:52:27,580
[SPEAKER_01]: The Sonic Adventure had them too.

827
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:28,460
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

828
00:52:28,945 --> 00:52:31,026
[SPEAKER_10]: Imagine trying to play them in Japanese.

829
00:52:31,206 --> 00:52:35,068
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, that's kind of sad, though, that you stopped playing after all that.

830
00:52:57,576 --> 00:53:06,001
[SPEAKER_03]: My first streamcast was Japanese, and we had Sonic Adventure, so trying to make myself read it, it was fun, but yeah.

831
00:53:08,702 --> 00:53:12,905
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, well, another story for you guys about Xbox Live Arcade.

832
00:53:13,365 --> 00:53:16,267
[SPEAKER_08]: Crap, I linked myself to the wrong story, didn't I?

833
00:53:17,107 --> 00:53:17,727
[SPEAKER_08]: Son of a gun.

834
00:53:17,747 --> 00:53:20,549
[SPEAKER_08]: You need to talk more Sonic Adventure, I lost my story.

835
00:53:23,010 --> 00:53:25,972
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, what was your favorite level in Sonic Adventure?

836
00:53:27,378 --> 00:53:28,759
[SPEAKER_10]: Running from the semi-truck.

837
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:32,121
[SPEAKER_03]: That was Sonic, yeah, Sonic Adventure 2.

838
00:53:32,641 --> 00:53:35,663
[SPEAKER_10]: And then also, that's the same semi-truck that is in the beginning of Bayonetta.

839
00:53:36,423 --> 00:53:36,703
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

840
00:53:36,863 --> 00:53:37,063
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

841
00:53:37,224 --> 00:53:37,924
[SPEAKER_10]: Cool.

842
00:53:38,424 --> 00:53:43,267
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I love, in Sonic Adventure, it's the Sky Highway, or the Speed Highway.

843
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:44,280
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

844
00:53:58,931 --> 00:54:02,874
[SPEAKER_08]: Bungayoh HD is coming out for Xbox Live Arcade.

845
00:54:16,664 --> 00:54:19,267
[SPEAKER_08]: You can break out into a sweat trying to dodge 5,000 bullets in 1080p.

846
00:54:33,263 --> 00:54:35,183
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, and that's what Bangaio is all about.

847
00:54:35,523 --> 00:54:43,065
[SPEAKER_08]: My question is, though, if Bangaio is going like HD and all this, see, it's horizontal.

848
00:54:43,225 --> 00:54:44,885
[SPEAKER_08]: Wasn't Bangaio another vertical shooter?

849
00:54:45,505 --> 00:54:48,986
[SPEAKER_08]: Those don't translate too well into the HD because it's the wrong proportion.

850
00:54:49,446 --> 00:54:53,827
[SPEAKER_08]: Unless you were able to turn your HD TV like on its side, then it might work a lot better.

851
00:54:53,887 --> 00:54:54,307
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

852
00:54:54,427 --> 00:54:56,847
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, they'll just have borders on the side like the final fight.

853
00:54:57,187 --> 00:54:58,167
[SPEAKER_08]: It always looks weird.

854
00:54:58,187 --> 00:55:01,828
[SPEAKER_08]: It always looks so weird because that's like half the screen with those games.

855
00:55:03,155 --> 00:55:15,742
[SPEAKER_03]: to make him well try playing well some games though like I remember Galactic Attack had a scrolling screen where you could scroll from side to side and it was just shorter and maintain your proportion

856
00:55:17,139 --> 00:55:17,519
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

857
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:20,300
[SPEAKER_08]: By the way, this is the other cool thing about the game.

858
00:55:20,340 --> 00:55:23,562
[SPEAKER_08]: It's got 100 levels in the game, so lots to play through.

859
00:55:23,622 --> 00:55:24,282
[SPEAKER_08]: But guess what?

860
00:55:24,782 --> 00:55:30,664
[SPEAKER_08]: If you finish all 100 levels and you decide, gosh, I need something new to play, use the level editor.

861
00:55:31,145 --> 00:55:35,266
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to get to build your own levels and share them on Xbox Live.

862
00:55:35,546 --> 00:55:36,347
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds like fun.

863
00:55:36,787 --> 00:55:37,367
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

864
00:55:38,087 --> 00:55:39,068
[SPEAKER_03]: Bunga is a fun game.

865
00:55:39,588 --> 00:55:39,888
[SPEAKER_08]: Mm-hmm.

866
00:55:40,508 --> 00:55:42,889
[SPEAKER_08]: So all this Dreamcast revival, good times.

867
00:55:43,670 --> 00:55:44,250
[SPEAKER_08]: Very good times.

868
00:55:45,490 --> 00:55:46,351
[SPEAKER_03]: It's full of happiness.

869
00:55:46,611 --> 00:55:46,811
[SPEAKER_08]: Mm-hmm.

870
00:55:48,675 --> 00:55:56,862
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, in other news, there is a game called Aero Cross High Air, the OFLC, the Australian rating thing.

871
00:55:58,263 --> 00:55:59,764
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one put out by Namco Bondi.

872
00:56:00,645 --> 00:56:08,071
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's actually the German USK rated Metro Cross High Air GP.

873
00:56:11,413 --> 00:56:16,237
[SPEAKER_03]: So looking this over, they're actually related, from what I can tell.

874
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:22,881
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I was looking this over.

875
00:56:23,661 --> 00:56:25,382
[SPEAKER_08]: No, you have to remember the stories in this segment.

876
00:56:25,582 --> 00:56:31,505
[SPEAKER_08]: We didn't really prep in advance at all, so it's going to be a little bit jankier than usual, but it's live radio.

877
00:56:31,525 --> 00:56:31,946
[SPEAKER_08]: What can you do?

878
00:56:31,966 --> 00:56:42,411
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's saying that Metro Cross is supposed to be like a redo of that 1985 Metro Cross that Namco put out, which is a side-scrolling foot race, and you avoid giant soda cans.

879
00:56:44,393 --> 00:56:45,753
[SPEAKER_03]: But what's Arrow Cross?

880
00:56:46,554 --> 00:56:46,754
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

881
00:56:46,774 --> 00:56:46,834
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

882
00:56:47,677 --> 00:56:50,319
[SPEAKER_08]: Those soda cans are as big as that guy's torso.

883
00:56:50,519 --> 00:56:51,559
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are huge.

884
00:56:51,759 --> 00:56:54,001
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, the soda cans actually are as big as him, I believe.

885
00:56:54,461 --> 00:56:54,701
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

886
00:56:55,802 --> 00:56:57,823
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob, can you jump over soda cans that are your size?

887
00:56:58,843 --> 00:56:59,184
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably not.

888
00:56:59,204 --> 00:57:00,564
[SPEAKER_03]: They look vaguely like Coke, too.

889
00:57:01,185 --> 00:57:01,845
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, crap!

890
00:57:05,267 --> 00:57:06,188
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, we're not to that story.

891
00:57:06,208 --> 00:57:08,770
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, I know, but...

892
00:57:25,603 --> 00:57:36,380
[SPEAKER_08]: One thing that Loki didn't mention during the show when he was talking about the iPhone and all those upgrades is that Apple also announced their big new social network this week called Ping Has anyone been using Ping?

893
00:57:37,462 --> 00:57:38,364
[SPEAKER_08]: Alan, have you used Ping?

894
00:57:39,136 --> 00:57:41,538
[SPEAKER_10]: I have no idea what it's going to offer me.

895
00:57:58,588 --> 00:58:10,801
[SPEAKER_08]: I was thinking at first like the way they were demoing it, I thought Ping was going to be this like awesome replacement for Facebook because it would be like Facebook but music oriented and then like no FarmVille or any of those games that are on Facebook.

896
00:58:10,901 --> 00:58:17,628
[SPEAKER_08]: And don't get me wrong, there's a time and a place for FarmVille and Family Feud and Price is Right and all those Facebook games, but sometimes you don't want all that bullshit.

897
00:58:18,249 --> 00:58:19,771
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was also thinking that like, oh,

898
00:58:20,896 --> 00:58:21,156
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.com

899
00:58:42,330 --> 00:58:47,573
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't even write your own status update unless you're Lady Gaga or one of the famous people on there.

900
00:58:47,954 --> 00:58:53,877
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's like you can use it to follow famous people and then see what songs your friends are buying and make its own top ten list.

901
00:58:53,917 --> 00:58:56,359
[SPEAKER_08]: But otherwise, it's kind of like, what's the point?

902
00:58:56,459 --> 00:58:56,859
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't get it.

903
00:58:56,899 --> 00:59:02,503
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure that either her or her label is being... I mean, when she recommends an artist, I'm sure it's really from her.

904
00:59:02,603 --> 00:59:09,287
[SPEAKER_10]: But if you buy through the iTunes store, someone's making money for that referral for all the Gaga stans that buy what she says to buy.

905
00:59:09,727 --> 00:59:10,468
[SPEAKER_10]: and I'll see you next time.

906
00:59:25,470 --> 00:59:26,970
[SPEAKER_08]: But no, it's none of that.

907
00:59:27,191 --> 00:59:32,232
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just, hey, here's all the shit your friends are buying so you can make fun of them when they buy Spice Girls' greatest hits.

908
00:59:33,252 --> 00:59:35,593
[SPEAKER_08]: Although you really shouldn't make fun of that guy because that's probably me.

909
00:59:35,833 --> 00:59:36,833
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know what?

910
00:59:37,153 --> 00:59:37,633
[SPEAKER_08]: Stop hating.

911
00:59:38,474 --> 00:59:38,734
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

912
00:59:40,254 --> 00:59:40,674
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

913
00:59:41,275 --> 00:59:45,296
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, Jessica Harper's in our chat, our good buddy from Under Station Live.

914
00:59:45,716 --> 00:59:48,817
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that explains why she was at the Apple building a couple weeks back.

915
00:59:48,857 --> 00:59:49,397
[SPEAKER_08]: That's true.

916
00:59:49,437 --> 00:59:51,978
[SPEAKER_08]: When she was at San Jose, she was visiting the Apple building.

917
00:59:52,018 --> 00:59:52,718
[SPEAKER_08]: Now we know why.

918
00:59:53,718 --> 00:59:55,379
[SPEAKER_08]: She was getting her ping thing.

919
00:59:56,399 --> 00:59:56,739
[SPEAKER_08]: Ding.

920
00:59:57,159 --> 00:59:57,439
[SPEAKER_08]: Wing.

921
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:00,020
[SPEAKER_08]: Lie.

922
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:00,501
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

923
01:00:01,041 --> 01:00:04,262
[SPEAKER_08]: Redertainment in chat says, iTunes has had Genius Mixes for a while now.

924
01:00:04,322 --> 01:00:08,423
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not a bad way to discover music, although it's your own music.

925
01:00:08,443 --> 01:00:12,885
[SPEAKER_08]: The Genius Mixes run off your own, at least as far as I've seen, it's your own music library.

926
01:00:13,165 --> 01:00:14,025
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's really cool.

927
01:00:14,045 --> 01:00:14,646
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I have a...

928
01:00:15,626 --> 01:00:18,007
[SPEAKER_08]: Like a lot of people, I have fairly eclectic music tastes.

929
01:00:18,367 --> 01:00:20,528
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, you know, I have some synth pop for those days.

930
01:00:20,648 --> 01:00:25,009
[SPEAKER_08]: I have some, you know, Alanis and, you know, Tori for my angsty lesbian days.

931
01:00:25,409 --> 01:00:27,610
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a variety of music in my collection.

932
01:00:27,690 --> 01:00:29,911
[SPEAKER_08]: But the Genius Playlist is a good way to kind of like separate it.

933
01:00:30,351 --> 01:00:34,433
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I'll be like, okay, today I want to hear Tegan and Sarah and like everything that sounds like it.

934
01:00:34,553 --> 01:00:36,913
[SPEAKER_08]: And it'll kind of come up with a pretty decent mix.

935
01:00:37,994 --> 01:00:39,514
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I don't know.

936
01:00:40,355 --> 01:00:40,655
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

937
01:00:42,035 --> 01:00:43,577
[SPEAKER_08]: iFarted in chat.

938
01:00:44,158 --> 01:00:45,720
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, that's their name, iFarted.

939
01:00:46,140 --> 01:00:48,783
[SPEAKER_08]: Says, Sky secretly bought Milli Vanilli songs.

940
01:00:48,903 --> 01:00:49,344
[SPEAKER_08]: Admit it.

941
01:00:49,604 --> 01:00:50,986
[SPEAKER_08]: LOL.

942
01:00:51,526 --> 01:00:51,987
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll admit it.

943
01:00:52,047 --> 01:00:55,951
[SPEAKER_08]: I bought them back in 1990 or whenever they were actually out.

944
01:00:56,332 --> 01:00:57,093
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I had a single.

945
01:00:57,113 --> 01:00:59,055
[SPEAKER_10]: That was 91, so we were like...

946
01:00:59,455 --> 01:01:00,196
[SPEAKER_08]: I was in junior high.

947
01:01:00,636 --> 01:01:06,663
[SPEAKER_08]: I was actually quoted in the junior high paper during the whole debacle because they ran a story on it.

948
01:01:06,683 --> 01:01:12,389
[SPEAKER_08]: And I said something like, well, if they just released the names of the guys who really did it, I'd still buy their music.

949
01:01:12,469 --> 01:01:13,310
[SPEAKER_08]: It's cool.

950
01:01:14,491 --> 01:01:15,052
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

951
01:01:44,451 --> 01:01:46,852
[SPEAKER_08]: Like in retrospect, how obvious is their faking?

952
01:01:47,052 --> 01:01:48,492
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, for real?

953
01:01:48,632 --> 01:01:51,433
[SPEAKER_03]: These guys are supposed to have also had a good voice on their own.

954
01:01:53,833 --> 01:01:56,014
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and they wanted to do their own stuff.

955
01:01:56,034 --> 01:01:56,794
[SPEAKER_10]: I need to hear the chorus.

956
01:01:58,655 --> 01:02:07,997
[SPEAKER_10]: They performed on an MTV Spring Break back when that was still going on and they actually used an actual LP for their lip sync and it skipped.

957
01:02:09,037 --> 01:02:10,238
[SPEAKER_08]: It was like an Ashley Simpson thing.

958
01:02:10,758 --> 01:02:10,918
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

959
01:02:11,874 --> 01:02:32,282
[SPEAKER_08]: so they were doing their choreography and the girl you know it's true was stuttering because I guess they couldn't afford a cassette nice that's gotta be slightly embarrassing alright so let's go back to some gaming news I'm sorry I gotta shut off the Milli Vanilli for now Redertainment in our chatroom says I can't give a 14 year old shit watch me

960
01:02:33,973 --> 01:02:34,393
[SPEAKER_08]: That's true.

961
01:02:34,834 --> 01:02:38,196
[SPEAKER_08]: There's some little shits at, like, Golf Land sometimes.

962
01:02:38,256 --> 01:02:43,779
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm like, the fuck I can't tell this kid what to do when he's, like, 14 years old and, like, thinks he's all, like, a badass.

963
01:02:43,839 --> 01:02:52,424
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, um, you know, someday you're gonna, like, be unemployed and hating life and fathering tons of babies and, yeah.

964
01:02:52,765 --> 01:02:53,085
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

965
01:02:53,345 --> 01:02:55,686
[SPEAKER_10]: My mom will roll you down with a Range Rover if you don't stop.

966
01:02:55,706 --> 01:02:56,147
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

967
01:02:57,407 --> 01:02:59,569
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, uh, hey, back to gaming news.

968
01:02:59,649 --> 01:03:01,030
[SPEAKER_08]: From Milli Vanilli to Mario.

969
01:03:01,550 --> 01:03:02,250
Ha ha ha ha!

970
01:03:03,351 --> 01:03:03,892
[SPEAKER_08]: Super Mario Bros.

971
01:03:03,912 --> 01:03:04,512
[SPEAKER_08]: 25th Anniversary

972
01:03:28,250 --> 01:03:37,019
[SPEAKER_08]: Mario All-Stars came back in 1993, and that was Mario, Mario 2, Mario 3, and the Lost Levels, which was really Japanese Mario 2.

973
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:44,387
[SPEAKER_08]: In their cartridge, they got our Mario 2 as Mario USA, even though it was really Doki Doki Panic, and I've gone cross-eyed.

974
01:03:45,684 --> 01:03:58,833
[SPEAKER_08]: apparently the Wii reissue is going to have special packaging and there'll be a little booklet and a CD of Mario music that will include stuff from the original game all the way to Mario Galaxy 2 but no word if there are extra Mario games included with this

975
01:04:00,225 --> 01:04:01,586
[SPEAKER_08]: Game Boy Advance got special reissues of each one.

976
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:24,521
[SPEAKER_08]: True, true.

977
01:04:24,882 --> 01:04:26,744
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, the Advanced, yeah.

978
01:04:26,825 --> 01:04:27,666
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, Mario Advanced.

979
01:04:27,706 --> 01:04:30,770
[SPEAKER_10]: I think Mario Advanced 2 is really Super Mario Bros.

980
01:04:30,790 --> 01:04:30,770
3.

981
01:04:30,870 --> 01:04:34,455
[SPEAKER_10]: They were out of order, but they all got a GBA remake treatment.

982
01:04:34,836 --> 01:04:35,637
[SPEAKER_10]: They were really well done.

983
01:04:35,978 --> 01:04:38,982
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm kind of curious, are we just going to be getting the same...

984
01:04:41,716 --> 01:04:43,137
[SPEAKER_08]: Super Nintendo Game Mario World

985
01:05:05,302 --> 01:05:05,562
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura,

986
01:05:26,034 --> 01:05:28,237
[SPEAKER_08]: and I guess you are getting a CD full of music, whatever.

987
01:05:28,297 --> 01:05:33,082
[SPEAKER_08]: It just seems like there ought to be a little bit more to this or some extra Mario games or something.

988
01:05:33,122 --> 01:05:34,784
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, come on, it's the Nintendo Wii.

989
01:05:35,285 --> 01:05:37,447
[SPEAKER_08]: You have a lot of extra space to do stuff, right?

990
01:05:37,467 --> 01:05:39,590
[SPEAKER_10]: Watch it not have classic controller support.

991
01:05:40,270 --> 01:05:40,391
[SPEAKER_10]: Ha!

992
01:05:41,071 --> 01:05:42,252
[SPEAKER_10]: Just because.

993
01:05:43,633 --> 01:05:45,133
[SPEAKER_10]: You gotta use the Wii stick sideways.

994
01:05:45,233 --> 01:05:46,974
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, if they put Mario World on it, that won't work.

995
01:05:48,095 --> 01:05:49,015
[SPEAKER_08]: Because there were four buttons.

996
01:05:49,035 --> 01:05:52,797
[SPEAKER_08]: You had the spinny jump and the... Let's see.

997
01:05:53,418 --> 01:05:59,841
[SPEAKER_08]: Y was run, B was jump, X was spinny jump, and A was... I think also fireball or something.

998
01:05:59,861 --> 01:06:01,542
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think it did anything, really.

999
01:06:02,803 --> 01:06:03,063
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow.

1000
01:06:05,273 --> 01:06:05,873
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

1001
01:06:06,634 --> 01:06:07,794
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving on, DarkSakura.

1002
01:06:08,214 --> 01:06:10,535
[SPEAKER_08]: You were laughing at some pictures you brought up earlier.

1003
01:06:10,675 --> 01:06:11,436
[SPEAKER_08]: What's this all about?

1004
01:06:12,356 --> 01:06:13,797
[SPEAKER_03]: They're fantastically filthy.

1005
01:06:14,317 --> 01:06:15,938
[SPEAKER_03]: At least I think they are.

1006
01:06:16,258 --> 01:06:20,419
[SPEAKER_03]: It's these little additions that hook onto the Wii Remote.

1007
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:27,643
[SPEAKER_03]: They are put out by Mojo Wejo, and they are supposed to transform... Mojo Wejo!

1008
01:06:29,204 --> 01:06:30,546
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a quote.

1009
01:06:30,626 --> 01:06:36,736
[SPEAKER_03]: Able to transform the varying motions of the control into appropriate vibration signals.

1010
01:06:38,820 --> 01:06:40,242
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh.

1011
01:06:40,743 --> 01:06:42,226
[SPEAKER_03]: They're vibrators.

1012
01:06:43,737 --> 01:06:46,158
[SPEAKER_03]: They are interesting looking violators.

1013
01:06:46,178 --> 01:06:46,958
[SPEAKER_08]: They're will-dos.

1014
01:06:47,378 --> 01:06:48,678
[SPEAKER_08]: They're we-dildos.

1015
01:06:48,858 --> 01:06:49,678
[SPEAKER_03]: They're we-dos.

1016
01:06:49,818 --> 01:06:50,219
[SPEAKER_03]: We-dos.

1017
01:06:50,679 --> 01:06:51,219
[SPEAKER_03]: We-dos.

1018
01:06:51,339 --> 01:06:54,199
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to show you chat room and I want to see what you think about this.

1019
01:06:56,840 --> 01:07:00,201
[SPEAKER_03]: Would this be a turn-on or a total buzzkill?

1020
01:07:01,061 --> 01:07:05,042
[SPEAKER_08]: One of them looks like something you would use to pick up radioactive material.

1021
01:07:05,102 --> 01:07:07,423
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, it doesn't even really look like... What's that supposed to do?

1022
01:07:07,503 --> 01:07:08,723
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, pinch things?

1023
01:07:08,863 --> 01:07:09,123
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no.

1024
01:07:09,183 --> 01:07:10,463
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet it's for fapping.

1025
01:07:12,044 --> 01:07:12,584
Oh, wow.

1026
01:07:13,944 --> 01:07:14,845
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, look at it.

1027
01:07:15,666 --> 01:07:19,428
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be an adjustable little clamp that goes around your... It's the claw.

1028
01:07:21,930 --> 01:07:23,191
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it adjustable sizes?

1029
01:07:23,231 --> 01:07:24,932
[SPEAKER_08]: Because, you know, I need extra large.

1030
01:07:27,814 --> 01:07:28,495
[SPEAKER_08]: Why are you laughing?

1031
01:07:29,075 --> 01:07:31,997
[SPEAKER_03]: I just looked over and saw Ellen give you a sideways look.

1032
01:07:37,021 --> 01:07:38,261
[SPEAKER_03]: But at any rate, yeah.

1033
01:07:38,862 --> 01:07:39,562
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what, though?

1034
01:07:39,722 --> 01:07:40,183
[SPEAKER_03]: One of these...

1035
01:07:43,062 --> 01:07:45,264
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think that I find that attractive.

1036
01:07:47,086 --> 01:07:52,090
[SPEAKER_03]: Does it come with Purell?

1037
01:07:52,491 --> 01:07:55,594
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think that a Wiimote would give off enough oomph.

1038
01:07:58,456 --> 01:07:59,577
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I don't know.

1039
01:07:59,637 --> 01:08:01,239
[SPEAKER_08]: What games are you going to be able to play with that?

1040
01:08:01,279 --> 01:08:02,039
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I want to know.

1041
01:08:02,420 --> 01:08:05,923
[SPEAKER_10]: What's just some housewife with a big grin on her face flailing around the living room?

1042
01:08:05,943 --> 01:08:06,804
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like, what are you doing?

1043
01:08:06,824 --> 01:08:08,145
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like, oh, I'm playing WarioWare.

1044
01:08:10,754 --> 01:08:13,095
[SPEAKER_10]: But your hands are free, yeah.

1045
01:08:14,235 --> 01:08:17,276
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm playing the ping pong ball shooting level.

1046
01:08:17,656 --> 01:08:20,216
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what it says on the Mojo Weejo website, okay?

1047
01:08:21,557 --> 01:08:25,058
[SPEAKER_03]: The device is attached to the accessory port on a Nintendo Wii remote control.

1048
01:08:25,478 --> 01:08:29,859
[SPEAKER_03]: The control is then connected to a Bluetooth-enabled PC running Mojo Weejo software.

1049
01:08:30,279 --> 01:08:34,000
[SPEAKER_03]: Using the Mojo Weejo patent-pending Motion 2 Vibration technology...

1050
01:08:34,500 --> 01:09:02,450
[SPEAKER_03]: the device is able to transform the varying motions of the control into appropriate vibration signals and send them to another selected device in the same room or over the internet Wii gaming console not required essentially turning your Wii remotes into shared remote controlled vibrators aka Wii vibrator or Wii brater that's from it kind of reminds me of the original there's a video oh wow there's a video to this oh hooray

1051
01:09:03,769 --> 01:09:06,010
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, I should play this over here so we can get the audio over the feed.

1052
01:09:06,031 --> 01:09:06,231
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on.

1053
01:09:06,251 --> 01:09:07,511
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got my sound turned off.

1054
01:09:07,632 --> 01:09:08,252
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, that's okay.

1055
01:09:08,272 --> 01:09:10,774
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to play this over the feed here.

1056
01:09:11,114 --> 01:09:11,654
[SPEAKER_08]: Where am I going?

1057
01:09:12,255 --> 01:09:12,575
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, here?

1058
01:09:12,855 --> 01:09:13,656
[SPEAKER_08]: The link?

1059
01:09:14,376 --> 01:09:16,778
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, follow the link to SF Weekly.

1060
01:09:16,838 --> 01:09:17,458
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1061
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:23,542
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if this has sound.

1062
01:09:24,042 --> 01:09:24,943
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just kind of doing its thing.

1063
01:09:27,133 --> 01:09:29,414
[SPEAKER_08]: It's drawn a little unhappy face.

1064
01:09:29,454 --> 01:09:30,394
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not really unhappy.

1065
01:09:30,434 --> 01:09:31,235
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the meh.

1066
01:09:31,275 --> 01:09:33,836
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it's like, I'm super happy!

1067
01:09:34,076 --> 01:09:38,818
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I'm playing the Nintendo Wii, but I have this box that says Mojo Weejo.

1068
01:09:39,578 --> 01:09:43,420
[SPEAKER_08]: And now my Wii has a little accessory that I shake.

1069
01:09:44,580 --> 01:09:45,761
[SPEAKER_08]: It's making a little shaky thing.

1070
01:09:47,441 --> 01:09:49,022
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm waiting for something interesting to happen here.

1071
01:09:49,762 --> 01:09:50,223
[SPEAKER_08]: What's it doing?

1072
01:09:50,283 --> 01:09:51,823
[SPEAKER_08]: It's transmitting to the computer.

1073
01:09:53,184 --> 01:09:55,745
[SPEAKER_03]: Then it's transmitting back to the Wii mode and it starts shaking.

1074
01:09:56,403 --> 01:09:58,483
[SPEAKER_08]: and now the eyes are turning all different colors.

1075
01:09:58,563 --> 01:10:00,064
[SPEAKER_08]: That is kind of scary.

1076
01:10:00,424 --> 01:10:01,484
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what it looks like?

1077
01:10:01,684 --> 01:10:05,245
[SPEAKER_03]: From what I'm getting on here, it's for cybering.

1078
01:10:05,385 --> 01:10:06,625
[SPEAKER_08]: It's for cyber sex.

1079
01:10:07,265 --> 01:10:09,826
[SPEAKER_08]: It runs off the Bluetooth in your computer.

1080
01:10:09,886 --> 01:10:10,566
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what it is.

1081
01:10:10,686 --> 01:10:11,766
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just using the Wiimote.

1082
01:10:12,427 --> 01:10:13,567
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, who doesn't have a Wiimote?

1083
01:10:14,007 --> 01:10:14,887
[SPEAKER_08]: So here's what you do.

1084
01:10:16,227 --> 01:10:17,508
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just explaining this like I know.

1085
01:10:17,928 --> 01:10:18,628
[SPEAKER_08]: You get on your...

1086
01:10:19,048 --> 01:10:25,003
[SPEAKER_08]: You get on your PC and you find someone you want to do some naughty things with online.

1087
01:10:25,324 --> 01:10:28,151
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you take the Wiimote and put on the attachment and...

1088
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:31,980
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, attach it.

1089
01:10:32,501 --> 01:10:37,945
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you go on the chat room and you put like, oh baby, I am so hot right now.

1090
01:10:38,205 --> 01:10:39,126
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, push the button.

1091
01:10:39,226 --> 01:10:41,047
[SPEAKER_08]: And then they push the button and you're like, ooh.

1092
01:10:42,188 --> 01:10:52,216
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead of typing, I am having so much trouble typing right now, it'd be like you, you know, V-E-R-Q, it'd be all scrambled.

1093
01:10:52,796 --> 01:10:56,379
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you'd have to get one of those little plastic covers for your monitor.

1094
01:11:02,490 --> 01:11:07,616
[SPEAKER_03]: You remember when people always had the little plastic covers for their keyboard and everything, and we used to just call it the Jizz Guard.

1095
01:11:08,797 --> 01:11:10,039
[SPEAKER_08]: Splash Zone.

1096
01:11:10,059 --> 01:11:10,379
[SPEAKER_08]: Good times.

1097
01:11:12,422 --> 01:11:14,124
[SPEAKER_08]: Or you just play Rez with it, honestly.

1098
01:11:14,184 --> 01:11:16,086
[SPEAKER_08]: That's really what it's made for, so yeah.

1099
01:11:17,912 --> 01:11:42,667
[SPEAKER_08]: You have amused Tara with your explanation Good, good Alright Well, speaking of sensual video games The Wii Balance Board is now supported in a massage game Oh, you're gonna love this, DarkSakura Called Love Press Plus Plus This looks like the type of massage game that has happy endings Not the type of massage you paid good money to go to school to learn

1100
01:11:45,034 --> 01:11:57,550
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be shown off this month at the Tokyo Game Show 2010 It's a massage game called Love Press Press It's by Shirai Labs and it uses massage recognition to stimulate the physical communication of lovers

1101
01:12:01,397 --> 01:12:02,458
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

1102
01:12:02,698 --> 01:12:06,580
[SPEAKER_08]: You choose a virtual partner and you can pick from various shapes and ages.

1103
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:08,981
[SPEAKER_08]: Although I somehow doubt there's old fatties.

1104
01:12:12,123 --> 01:12:16,165
[SPEAKER_08]: The shapes are skinny and skinnier probably and the ages are like young or 18.

1105
01:12:17,206 --> 01:12:18,006
[SPEAKER_08]: No gilfs.

1106
01:12:18,186 --> 01:12:20,768
[SPEAKER_08]: Because like real people don't ever be in these games.

1107
01:12:21,668 --> 01:12:22,249
[SPEAKER_08]: Creepy.

1108
01:12:22,329 --> 01:12:22,570
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

1109
01:12:41,363 --> 01:12:42,263
[SPEAKER_08]: There's actually an announcement.

1110
01:12:42,283 --> 01:12:42,803
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what, Rob?

1111
01:12:42,863 --> 01:12:44,344
[SPEAKER_03]: There has to be one line in that game.

1112
01:12:46,124 --> 01:12:50,866
[SPEAKER_08]: Look, here's this guy playing the game and it just looks like he's having anal sex with a balance board.

1113
01:12:50,886 --> 01:12:52,526
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really what it looks like to me.

1114
01:12:52,946 --> 01:12:54,246
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, tell me I'm wrong.

1115
01:12:54,867 --> 01:12:55,167
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1116
01:12:55,287 --> 01:12:57,127
[SPEAKER_08]: But he's having anal sex with a balance board.

1117
01:12:57,147 --> 01:12:59,268
[SPEAKER_03]: Link that in the chat room and put it to a quick vote.

1118
01:12:59,768 --> 01:13:02,129
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1119
01:13:02,269 --> 01:13:03,389
[SPEAKER_08]: Quick poll in our chat room.

1120
01:13:03,409 --> 01:13:04,849
[SPEAKER_03]: Anal board sex.

[SPEAKER_08]: Go to the following link.

1122
01:13:06,530 --> 01:13:08,570
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that man having wee board sex?

1123
01:13:08,850 --> 01:13:09,370
[SPEAKER_08]: Anal sex.

1124
01:13:09,411 --> 01:13:09,711
[SPEAKER_08]: Hold on.

1125
01:13:10,071 --> 01:13:10,931
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me type that in bold.

1126
01:13:15,615 --> 01:13:15,975
[SPEAKER_03]: I vote too.

1127
01:13:20,317 --> 01:13:22,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe the longer we broadcast, the dirtier we get.

1128
01:13:22,598 --> 01:13:22,959
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1129
01:13:23,699 --> 01:13:24,079
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1130
01:13:24,239 --> 01:13:28,601
[SPEAKER_10]: Some hospitals in Japan are going to get way more weird emergency room visits than they're used to.

1131
01:13:30,042 --> 01:13:33,744
[SPEAKER_08]: It pinches!

1132
01:13:34,084 --> 01:13:35,084
[SPEAKER_08]: But you see what he's doing?

1133
01:13:35,104 --> 01:13:38,446
[SPEAKER_08]: He's massaging the board like it's supposed to be somebody's back.

1134
01:13:39,358 --> 01:13:45,667
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, okay, now this actually goes to something which is kind of a recent, and I've actually been reading sociological articles about this.

1135
01:13:46,127 --> 01:13:48,510
[SPEAKER_03]: That there's been this... About this?

1136
01:13:48,751 --> 01:13:49,892
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it has to do with it.

1137
01:13:50,012 --> 01:13:51,394
[SPEAKER_08]: Anal sex with rebalance boards?

1138
01:13:51,414 --> 01:13:52,155
[SPEAKER_08]: It has to do with it.

1139
01:13:52,195 --> 01:13:52,856
[SPEAKER_08]: You read a lot.

1140
01:13:54,438 --> 01:13:55,199
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, it's me.

1141
01:13:55,299 --> 01:13:57,220
[SPEAKER_03]: If there's information to be learned, I learn it.

1142
01:13:58,861 --> 01:14:11,550
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's actually been this big, and they've been interviewing people who are becoming less and less outwardly social, preferring to stay at home more often, who basically don't want sex.

1143
01:14:12,351 --> 01:14:14,993
[SPEAKER_03]: Want, I guess, companionship, but not like with a real person.

1144
01:14:16,054 --> 01:14:17,535
[SPEAKER_03]: Like this one guy married his doll.

1145
01:14:18,826 --> 01:14:20,267
[SPEAKER_08]: Also the guy who married the DS, right?

1146
01:14:20,327 --> 01:14:21,547
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the only guy who married his DS.

1147
01:14:21,607 --> 01:14:23,848
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's been this social thing lately.

1148
01:14:23,868 --> 01:14:25,428
[SPEAKER_03]: I was looking up some stuff about birth rates dropping.

1149
01:14:34,432 --> 01:14:38,796
[SPEAKER_03]: And they had that as a link in regards to birth rates dropping in Japan.

1150
01:14:40,137 --> 01:14:44,901
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, well, you know, isn't this just what we hear about, you know, kind of, you know, fringe behavior?

1151
01:14:44,921 --> 01:14:45,722
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not the norm.

1152
01:14:46,163 --> 01:14:51,007
[SPEAKER_03]: But apparently it's becoming either more of a trend or more of a public knowledge type thing.

1153
01:14:51,187 --> 01:14:54,530
[SPEAKER_03]: So this totally doesn't surprise me.

1154
01:14:56,744 --> 01:15:01,753
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, I'm just looking at this because they actually put on here, they put tweet love press to give your comments.

1155
01:15:02,394 --> 01:15:05,279
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm trying to see what comments, but it's all... We have a new president, Kat.

1156
01:15:05,539 --> 01:15:06,221
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, wait a minute.

1157
01:15:06,361 --> 01:15:06,521
[SPEAKER_08]: Like...

1158
01:15:07,532 --> 01:15:10,893
[SPEAKER_08]: All the results are more than two days old.

1159
01:15:12,534 --> 01:15:14,595
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't have enough people tweeting Love Press.

1160
01:15:14,755 --> 01:15:16,256
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we need to change that.

1161
01:15:18,477 --> 01:15:21,398
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks like everybody has tweeted Love Press two days ago.

1162
01:15:21,638 --> 01:15:28,941
[SPEAKER_03]: And Red Entertainment, yes, I am very familiar with the term, and I wasn't going to bring that up, but that's actually been, again, coming up.

1163
01:15:29,121 --> 01:15:29,722
[SPEAKER_03]: Asexuality.

1164
01:15:30,002 --> 01:15:30,162
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1165
01:15:31,042 --> 01:15:37,447
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I think you guys need to tweet about the love press and, you know, how you can't wait for the anal sex Wii balance board game.

1166
01:15:37,827 --> 01:15:39,729
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, the results of our quick poll are in.

1167
01:15:40,149 --> 01:15:40,930
[SPEAKER_08]: Here we go, let's see.

1168
01:15:41,390 --> 01:15:43,231
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I'm sorry, the quick poll again.

1169
01:15:43,392 --> 01:15:45,553
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that man giving anal sex to the balance board?

1170
01:15:46,274 --> 01:15:46,954
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, he is.

1171
01:15:47,215 --> 01:15:48,235
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, yes, yes.

1172
01:15:48,435 --> 01:15:49,696
[SPEAKER_08]: That's some butt sex right there.

1173
01:15:50,077 --> 01:15:51,158
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, yes, frown.

1174
01:15:51,338 --> 01:15:52,318
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, baby, oh, baby, yes.

1175
01:15:52,699 --> 01:15:53,920
[SPEAKER_08]: Sadly, yes, he is, guys.

1176
01:15:53,980 --> 01:15:54,560
[SPEAKER_08]: Goes blind.

1177
01:15:55,041 --> 01:15:57,042
[SPEAKER_08]: On a scale of 1 to 10, I'm gonna fuck you now.

1178
01:15:58,483 --> 01:16:00,245
[SPEAKER_08]: He's friending the Wii's, you know...

1179
01:16:00,845 --> 01:16:01,345
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1180
01:16:18,812 --> 01:16:19,753
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, you need to tweet.

1181
01:16:19,813 --> 01:16:22,675
[SPEAKER_08]: Right at the bottom of that page it says tweet Love Press to give your comments.

1182
01:16:22,695 --> 01:16:27,358
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would like our listeners to send their comments on the Love Press over to the makers of the game.

1183
01:16:27,378 --> 01:16:29,239
[SPEAKER_08]: They're waiting to hear your comments on Love Press.

1184
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:33,803
[SPEAKER_10]: If you take a towel and wrap it up and press it down on there, does it then become a waterboarding simulator?

1185
01:16:38,666 --> 01:16:38,986
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1186
01:16:40,047 --> 01:16:40,647
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a good question.

1187
01:16:41,548 --> 01:16:42,589
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, so there you go.

1188
01:16:42,649 --> 01:16:44,130
[SPEAKER_08]: There's another sensual game.

1189
01:16:44,170 --> 01:16:45,631
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's not sexual.

1190
01:16:45,671 --> 01:16:48,253
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just going to teach you how to massage.

1191
01:16:48,846 --> 01:16:50,787
[SPEAKER_03]: You know I hate the term happy ending, by the way.

1192
01:16:51,167 --> 01:16:52,828
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you do, which is why I say it all the time.

1193
01:16:52,928 --> 01:16:56,731
[SPEAKER_03]: That is not... I'm not going to get on my high horse about this.

1194
01:16:57,791 --> 01:16:59,072
[SPEAKER_08]: Hold on, but I have two questions.

1195
01:17:00,813 --> 01:17:03,855
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it something that would typically be done at the end of the session?

1196
01:17:04,495 --> 01:17:04,815
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1197
01:17:05,676 --> 01:17:07,317
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it going to make the recipient happy?

1198
01:17:07,957 --> 01:17:08,317
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1199
01:17:08,938 --> 01:17:10,659
[SPEAKER_08]: Therefore, it's a happy ending.

1200
01:17:12,904 --> 01:17:32,134
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it's all offensive and shit to massage people who take the art of massage very seriously, but... Well, on top of that, it's the other reason why we're running into all this legislation going around now trying to put police officials on the board of massage therapists in California who know nothing about it.

1201
01:17:32,374 --> 01:17:39,678
[SPEAKER_08]: As gamers, they're trying to say that M-rated games shouldn't be sold unless they have all these restrictions or games are porn and all this stuff.

1202
01:17:39,698 --> 01:17:40,158
[SPEAKER_03]: Blame the man.

1203
01:17:40,258 --> 01:17:41,018
[SPEAKER_03]: Stick it to the man.

1204
01:17:41,259 --> 01:17:41,739
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

1205
01:17:42,299 --> 01:17:48,901
[SPEAKER_10]: Have you seen DarkSakura, the YouTube where this masseuse is like, oh, would you like happy ending?

1206
01:17:48,941 --> 01:17:49,841
[SPEAKER_10]: And the guy says, yeah.

1207
01:17:49,881 --> 01:17:53,081
[SPEAKER_10]: And all of a sudden, like, balloons fall out of the sky and clowns come out.

1208
01:17:53,201 --> 01:17:55,042
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're like, yay!

1209
01:17:55,622 --> 01:17:58,623
[SPEAKER_10]: He's like in his towel clapping, like, yay!

1210
01:17:58,763 --> 01:17:59,403
[SPEAKER_03]: I should see that.

1211
01:17:59,443 --> 01:18:01,063
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds... Now that's funny.

1212
01:18:02,584 --> 01:18:04,164
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds entirely too amusing.

1213
01:18:04,844 --> 01:18:05,645
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you know how to find that?

1214
01:18:05,685 --> 01:18:06,746
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you know what I would look up?

1215
01:18:07,886 --> 01:18:08,687
[SPEAKER_08]: We got a marathon show.

1216
01:18:08,707 --> 01:18:09,468
[SPEAKER_08]: I can look up YouTubes.

1217
01:18:09,528 --> 01:18:09,908
[SPEAKER_08]: It's fine.

1218
01:18:10,028 --> 01:18:11,369
[SPEAKER_10]: Happy ending parody?

1219
01:18:11,489 --> 01:18:11,989
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1220
01:18:13,431 --> 01:18:14,792
[SPEAKER_10]: I could probably tell what it is from the cap.

1221
01:18:16,993 --> 01:18:17,213
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1222
01:18:17,954 --> 01:18:18,334
[SPEAKER_08]: This one?

1223
01:18:18,675 --> 01:18:20,876
[SPEAKER_08]: Happy ending massage HD uncut original version?

1224
01:18:21,076 --> 01:18:21,437
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that it?

1225
01:18:22,237 --> 01:18:23,298
[SPEAKER_08]: This girl's got big titties.

1226
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:26,460
[SPEAKER_08]: Now I want to just see this one.

1227
01:18:26,520 --> 01:18:29,843
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't... Mute it in case it's not it.

1228
01:18:30,443 --> 01:18:30,984
[SPEAKER_08]: Hold on.

1229
01:18:31,324 --> 01:18:32,525
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just going to mute that a little bit.

1230
01:18:34,594 --> 01:18:36,155
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, this is like softcore right here.

1231
01:18:36,195 --> 01:18:36,735
[SPEAKER_08]: That's hot.

1232
01:18:36,816 --> 01:18:37,196
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at her.

1233
01:18:37,676 --> 01:18:38,757
[SPEAKER_08]: Dang.

1234
01:18:39,417 --> 01:18:40,758
[SPEAKER_08]: This is awesome radio, by the way.

1235
01:18:41,138 --> 01:18:41,679
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to say.

1236
01:18:42,579 --> 01:18:44,501
[SPEAKER_03]: That's because we're amazing people.

1237
01:18:44,721 --> 01:18:45,081
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge.

1238
01:18:45,101 --> 01:18:45,601
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, no, it is.

1239
01:18:45,621 --> 01:18:45,981
[SPEAKER_08]: This is it.

1240
01:18:46,002 --> 01:18:46,402
[SPEAKER_10]: This is it.

1241
01:18:46,642 --> 01:18:46,882
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1242
01:18:47,783 --> 01:18:48,823
[SPEAKER_10]: Orange Lounge Cinemax.

1243
01:18:48,923 --> 01:18:49,344
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, hold on.

1244
01:18:49,364 --> 01:18:49,624
[SPEAKER_08]: Hold on.

1245
01:18:50,024 --> 01:18:50,965
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to watch this, DarkSakura.

1246
01:18:55,608 --> 01:18:55,948
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at that.

1247
01:18:56,008 --> 01:18:56,548
[SPEAKER_08]: Massaging his...

1248
01:18:58,266 --> 01:18:58,566
[SPEAKER_08]: Feet?

1249
01:18:59,547 --> 01:19:00,048
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at that.

1250
01:19:03,530 --> 01:19:05,372
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that the type of outfit you wear when giving massages?

1251
01:19:06,113 --> 01:19:06,433
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1252
01:19:07,854 --> 01:19:09,996
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a fan of sweatpants and a t-shirt.

1253
01:19:10,016 --> 01:19:12,818
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a sign, therapeutic massages only, no police allowed.

1254
01:19:23,428 --> 01:19:24,429
[SPEAKER_08]: You want happy endings?

1255
01:20:08,506 --> 01:20:09,207
[SPEAKER_04]: You happy now?

1256
01:20:11,107 --> 01:20:13,449
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it really wasn't what I was hoping for.

1257
01:20:14,149 --> 01:20:15,029
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no.

1258
01:20:16,070 --> 01:20:20,552
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe you want a handjob.

1259
01:20:20,692 --> 01:20:20,552
$50.

1260
01:20:20,852 --> 01:20:23,193
[SPEAKER_05]: For a handjob, right?

1261
01:20:23,614 --> 01:20:26,095
Yeah, handjob.

1262
01:20:26,115 --> 01:20:27,095
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, okay.

1263
01:20:28,296 --> 01:20:28,556
Okay.

1264
01:20:30,817 --> 01:20:31,698
[SPEAKER_04]: Handjob!

1265
01:20:38,700 --> 01:20:40,021
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're all in grease outfits.

1266
01:20:40,061 --> 01:20:40,881
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fantastic.

1267
01:20:42,222 --> 01:20:43,082
[SPEAKER_03]: He's doing it too.

1268
01:20:47,824 --> 01:20:48,785
[SPEAKER_08]: That was amazing.

1269
01:20:49,725 --> 01:20:51,786
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Ellen, for bringing that into my life.

1270
01:20:53,287 --> 01:20:54,007
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that in chat.

1271
01:20:54,027 --> 01:20:55,948
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, chat room, how you have missed out.

1272
01:20:56,368 --> 01:21:00,570
[SPEAKER_08]: For those listening on the podcast, YouTube user is Mediocre Films.

1273
01:21:01,391 --> 01:21:02,651
[SPEAKER_08]: There it is, Mediocre Films.

1274
01:21:02,871 --> 01:21:04,712
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's called Happy Ending Massage.

1275
01:21:05,653 --> 01:21:06,373
[SPEAKER_08]: It was brilliant.

1276
01:21:07,978 --> 01:21:10,719
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm trying to look at a stop motion movie.

1277
01:21:37,771 --> 01:21:38,912
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, this I've got to see.

1278
01:21:38,992 --> 01:21:42,536
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, we haven't rehearsed any of this, so I'm trying to see what this was.

1279
01:21:44,838 --> 01:21:49,744
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a stop motion animation of somebody doing Kirby's Adventure in yarn.

1280
01:21:53,407 --> 01:21:53,988
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to quote this.

1281
01:21:54,609 --> 01:21:56,450
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, it came from...

1282
01:21:59,059 --> 01:22:05,643
[SPEAKER_03]: The original idea came from staff at Goodfeel, which was inspired by a stop animation film made primarily with yarn, explains Ellis.

1283
01:22:05,723 --> 01:22:06,924
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm reading off Destructoid.

1284
01:22:07,524 --> 01:22:15,909
[SPEAKER_03]: With the ability for players to interact with the game's environment, such as unzipping the background panels, Kirby's Epic Yarn is really its own category as a platformer.

1285
01:22:16,489 --> 01:22:25,074
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and they're saying that nobody at Nintendo of America knew what it came from, so I'm seeing if this is perhaps the...

1286
01:22:27,682 --> 01:22:33,927
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, this was a stop-motion animation commercial that came out in Japan for Kirby's Adventure.

1287
01:22:35,248 --> 01:22:36,969
[SPEAKER_03]: All done with yarn.

1288
01:22:36,989 --> 01:22:38,070
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, it's got that yarn style.

1289
01:22:38,370 --> 01:22:38,971
[SPEAKER_08]: That's kind of cool.

1290
01:22:39,871 --> 01:22:40,552
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really cute.

1291
01:22:41,473 --> 01:22:43,514
[SPEAKER_08]: Isn't it amazing what the internet will unearth?

1292
01:22:43,594 --> 01:22:47,037
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, if you have an unoriginal idea, at some point the internet will find it.

1293
01:22:47,377 --> 01:22:47,998
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?

1294
01:22:48,138 --> 01:22:49,599
[SPEAKER_08]: Man, Kirby sure sucks.

1295
01:22:51,020 --> 01:22:51,680
[SPEAKER_03]: No, he does, though.

1296
01:22:54,144 --> 01:22:54,324
[SPEAKER_03]: Aw.

1297
01:22:56,185 --> 01:22:57,786
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't we get cute commercials like that, Rob?

1298
01:22:58,186 --> 01:22:59,127
[SPEAKER_03]: Explain it to me, please.

1299
01:22:59,287 --> 01:23:00,387
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not watching enough cartoons.

1300
01:23:01,248 --> 01:23:02,968
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we don't have cool commercials anymore.

1301
01:23:03,889 --> 01:23:05,330
[SPEAKER_10]: How does a hipster play Kirby?

1302
01:23:06,370 --> 01:23:06,630
[SPEAKER_08]: How?

1303
01:23:06,870 --> 01:23:09,592
[SPEAKER_10]: Without inhaling any powers because it's a pure experience.

1304
01:23:11,312 --> 01:23:12,493
[SPEAKER_09]: Ha ha ha ha ha.

1305
01:23:13,253 --> 01:23:13,673
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1306
01:23:13,974 --> 01:23:16,555
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you want to do that story on the third night's game you skipped over?

1307
01:23:17,095 --> 01:23:17,375
[SPEAKER_08]: I did.

1308
01:23:17,515 --> 01:23:18,896
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you do that one?

1309
01:23:19,676 --> 01:23:21,237
[SPEAKER_03]: I opened everything up in order.

1310
01:23:22,113 --> 01:23:23,655
[SPEAKER_08]: Did I link the same story twice?

1311
01:23:23,915 --> 01:23:24,616
[SPEAKER_08]: Ah, crap.

1312
01:23:25,057 --> 01:23:26,358
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I just linked the same thing twice.

1313
01:23:27,019 --> 01:23:27,560
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry about that.

1314
01:23:27,640 --> 01:23:28,361
[SPEAKER_08]: Skip that story then.

1315
01:23:28,561 --> 01:23:29,142
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll do these two.

1316
01:23:29,462 --> 01:23:30,383
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, so yeah.

1317
01:23:30,463 --> 01:23:31,485
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's the wrong link.

1318
01:23:31,545 --> 01:23:32,186
[SPEAKER_08]: I screwed up.

1319
01:23:32,246 --> 01:23:32,786
[SPEAKER_08]: Blah, blah, blah.

1320
01:23:33,027 --> 01:23:34,108
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thanks, Rob.

1321
01:23:34,128 --> 01:23:34,609
[SPEAKER_08]: You're welcome.

1322
01:23:35,660 --> 01:23:37,141
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, now you gotta do two stories in a row.

1323
01:23:37,442 --> 01:23:37,742
[SPEAKER_08]: Fine.

1324
01:23:38,223 --> 01:23:38,663
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll do three.

1325
01:23:38,683 --> 01:23:38,823
[SPEAKER_03]: Fine.

1326
01:23:39,304 --> 01:23:39,524
[SPEAKER_03]: Fine.

1327
01:23:39,584 --> 01:23:39,884
[SPEAKER_03]: Do it.

1328
01:23:39,964 --> 01:23:41,426
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't care.

1329
01:23:41,446 --> 01:23:41,426
007.

1330
01:23:42,146 --> 01:23:47,292
[SPEAKER_08]: A slew of pre-order items for GoldenEye 007 coming out on the Wii.

1331
01:23:47,752 --> 01:23:54,319
[SPEAKER_08]: GameStop, if you get the game there, you're gonna get Invisibility Mode will be unlocked in the game for split-screen multiplayer.

1332
01:23:55,019 --> 01:23:59,184
[SPEAKER_08]: Each player will be invisible for a set amount of time, allowing you to sneak up on each other.

1333
01:23:59,804 --> 01:24:00,684
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

1334
01:24:15,129 --> 01:24:42,012
[SPEAKER_08]: but then I don't know what happens with that so maybe they're going to I don't know if they're codes you put into the game which will end up on the internet everywhere or if it's some type of DLC which doesn't make sense because Nintendo Wii doesn't do a lot of DLC although there's some like the Final Fantasy 4 game has some DLC in it but yeah that's strange oh by the way if you get the game at Walmart you get a t-shirt that says cheater with an odd job hat

1335
01:24:42,572 --> 01:24:44,174
[SPEAKER_08]: Now that you can't get with a code.

1336
01:24:44,214 --> 01:24:47,157
[SPEAKER_08]: So I hate to say it, but Walmart seems to be the best place to get this game.

1337
01:24:49,159 --> 01:24:49,619
[SPEAKER_08]: So there you go.

1338
01:24:49,639 --> 01:24:51,021
[SPEAKER_08]: A little odd job hat says cheater.

1339
01:24:51,041 --> 01:24:53,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's because anyone who uses odd job is a cheap bitch.

1340
01:24:54,504 --> 01:24:56,867
[SPEAKER_08]: No, odd job is awesome and you just can't deal with it.

1341
01:24:57,347 --> 01:24:57,647
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1342
01:24:59,229 --> 01:24:59,750
[SPEAKER_08]: By the way,

1343
01:25:00,492 --> 01:25:02,554
[SPEAKER_08]: Martin Hollis I imagine it's a business decision, isn't it?

1344
01:25:02,574 --> 01:25:03,355
[SPEAKER_08]: This name is valuable.

1345
01:25:03,375 --> 01:25:03,735
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's use it.

1346
01:25:17,890 --> 01:25:22,913
[SPEAKER_08]: I find it hard to picture Activision's top management being excited about the original and wanting to do it justice.

1347
01:25:23,333 --> 01:25:26,415
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, I find it hard to imagine them being excited about any game.

1348
01:25:26,795 --> 01:25:29,817
[SPEAKER_08]: It's my perception that they are trying to be EA, only more so.

1349
01:25:30,157 --> 01:25:34,619
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they're doing a fine job with that.

1350
01:25:34,979 --> 01:25:35,660
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, right?

1351
01:25:36,360 --> 01:25:37,941
[SPEAKER_08]: He's a little irritated there.

1352
01:25:38,641 --> 01:25:41,623
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, he does say nice things about the developers themselves.

1353
01:25:41,683 --> 01:25:44,845
[SPEAKER_08]: He says, quote, they are a good company.

1354
01:25:45,005 --> 01:25:46,726
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm confident they've done their very best.

1355
01:25:48,422 --> 01:25:49,482
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1356
01:26:18,255 --> 01:26:25,738
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a first-slash-third-person shooter that originally came out in 2005, and you took on the role of the Stranger.

1357
01:26:26,499 --> 01:26:28,499
[SPEAKER_08]: But it was kind of like an Oddworld type of game.

1358
01:26:28,539 --> 01:26:32,821
[SPEAKER_08]: You used ammo, animals, bugs to actually take out enemies.

1359
01:26:33,581 --> 01:26:38,864
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to have updated visuals to 720p, updated graphics, updated music and all that stuff.

1360
01:26:39,244 --> 01:26:41,845
[SPEAKER_08]: The dialogue in the game is also being remastered.

1361
01:26:43,759 --> 01:26:56,863
[SPEAKER_10]: Is this the... I remember the last Odyssey game that came out where you're a cowboy where you're actually a cow and you're shooting enemies first-person shooter style and I remember it bombed horribly.

1362
01:26:56,943 --> 01:26:57,663
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that what this is?

1363
01:26:57,763 --> 01:26:58,183
[SPEAKER_10]: Remade?

1364
01:26:59,404 --> 01:27:00,684
[SPEAKER_08]: But you're not a cow, I don't think.

1365
01:27:01,184 --> 01:27:02,145
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it doesn't look like it.

1366
01:27:02,225 --> 01:27:03,305
[SPEAKER_10]: Like a moose or something?

1367
01:27:03,625 --> 01:27:04,485
[SPEAKER_10]: Someone in chattel now.

1368
01:27:04,545 --> 01:27:07,066
[SPEAKER_03]: How is a cow like a moose?

1369
01:27:08,066 --> 01:27:09,567
[SPEAKER_08]: They're both big and stinky.

1370
01:27:11,838 --> 01:27:12,138
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1371
01:27:12,599 --> 01:27:14,841
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's going to be 720p and all that good stuff.

1372
01:27:14,941 --> 01:27:16,683
[SPEAKER_08]: They are targeting an Easter release.

1373
01:27:16,883 --> 01:27:20,406
[SPEAKER_08]: One other thing that they're putting in the game, PlayStation Move support.

1374
01:27:20,866 --> 01:27:23,189
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's almost like a whole different game from what it used to be.

1375
01:27:23,209 --> 01:27:24,390
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it the Move?

1376
01:27:26,131 --> 01:27:27,072
[SPEAKER_03]: With what Alan said.

1377
01:27:27,112 --> 01:27:27,512
[SPEAKER_03]: Shut up.

1378
01:27:30,916 --> 01:27:32,517
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't stop!

1379
01:27:33,700 --> 01:27:33,940
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura?

1380
01:28:03,090 --> 01:28:05,251
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I was just thinking about pizza.

1381
01:28:06,532 --> 01:28:08,673
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll take a break here in a minute and do the pizza stuff.

1382
01:28:09,534 --> 01:28:14,297
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, as far as there's news for DJ Hero 2.

1383
01:28:14,957 --> 01:28:18,559
[SPEAKER_03]: The RZA is in the cast of DJ Hero 2.

1384
01:28:19,400 --> 01:28:24,243
[SPEAKER_03]: As in, dude from Wu-Tang Clan who also likes to put out kung fu movies.

1385
01:28:26,764 --> 01:28:31,387
[SPEAKER_03]: They've actually got images for his costume up here and I'm pulling those up to have a good look at them.

1386
01:28:33,311 --> 01:28:33,771
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty cool.

1387
01:28:34,552 --> 01:28:38,454
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's him being motion captured for the game, so that's actually pretty cool.

1388
01:28:38,974 --> 01:28:49,079
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, fully digitized, gonna be in the game, and I'm just double checking to see if there's any other tracks.

1389
01:28:49,119 --> 01:28:50,880
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm entranced by the Ice Cream Truck music.

1390
01:28:50,920 --> 01:28:51,280
[SPEAKER_03]: Ice Cream Man!

1391
01:28:51,560 --> 01:28:52,061
[SPEAKER_03]: Ice Cream Man!

1392
01:28:52,281 --> 01:28:52,801
[SPEAKER_03]: Ice Cream Man!

1393
01:28:52,941 --> 01:28:53,621
[SPEAKER_03]: He's right there.

1394
01:28:53,841 --> 01:28:54,582
[SPEAKER_03]: Is he right out front?

1395
01:28:54,602 --> 01:29:00,545
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's kind of weird that it started showing up in the last year or so that Ice Cream Truck's been driving by.

1396
01:29:01,082 --> 01:29:24,001
[SPEAKER_03]: LL Cool J's I Can't Live Without My Radio and Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five's The Message and then the other one is Damian Marley's Welcome to Jamrock and Walter Murphy's A Fifth of Beethoven which was on the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack which I have two copies of on vinyl

1397
01:29:24,898 --> 01:29:25,478
[SPEAKER_08]: Because you're weird.

1398
01:29:26,139 --> 01:29:28,480
[SPEAKER_03]: I got my mom's and my uncle's copies each.

1399
01:29:28,821 --> 01:29:29,281
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all good.

1400
01:29:31,503 --> 01:29:35,125
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's also a Dollars and Cents BlackRock track for the game, too.

1401
01:29:36,026 --> 01:29:40,449
[SPEAKER_03]: But I just thought it was funny because the other article mentioned the other game that he had been motion captured in.

1402
01:29:40,489 --> 01:29:42,790
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know what that was, Rob?

1403
01:29:42,890 --> 01:29:45,532
[SPEAKER_03]: Wu-Tang Shaolin style fighting game for PS1.

1404
01:29:45,732 --> 01:29:47,633
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, God, I remember that game.

1405
01:29:48,014 --> 01:29:48,334
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1406
01:29:48,374 --> 01:29:50,996
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, it was like, oh, God, it was like the new Shaq Fu.

1407
01:29:52,259 --> 01:29:53,420
[SPEAKER_03]: But it wasn't really all that bad.

1408
01:29:53,900 --> 01:29:57,143
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember that Def Jam, the rap fighting game?

1409
01:29:57,203 --> 01:29:58,304
[SPEAKER_08]: There was one of those too?

1410
01:29:58,745 --> 01:29:59,205
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh man.

1411
01:30:01,047 --> 01:30:02,829
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of interesting stuff.

1412
01:30:03,297 --> 01:30:04,979
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, Mega Man Universe.

1413
01:30:05,059 --> 01:30:09,944
[SPEAKER_08]: More information was supposed to come out of PAX this week, but I don't remember seeing anything additional on this.

1414
01:30:10,004 --> 01:30:11,946
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe somebody in chat can fill us in on this.

1415
01:30:12,326 --> 01:30:12,686
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's the thing.

1416
01:30:12,706 --> 01:30:24,018
[SPEAKER_08]: There was a story saying that more Mega Man Universe information was going to be coming out because apparently they were giving away some little things that look like, I don't know, like little, I don't know what those are supposed to be.

1417
01:30:25,779 --> 01:30:26,240
[SPEAKER_08]: Are those like

1418
01:30:29,611 --> 01:30:30,334
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.com

1419
01:30:38,274 --> 01:30:39,494
[SPEAKER_08]: Like little pillows or something.

1420
01:30:39,574 --> 01:30:40,975
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, they just look like little pillows.

1421
01:30:41,935 --> 01:30:45,675
[SPEAKER_03]: The Ryu is kind of funny, but the Rockman looks actually pretty cool.

1422
01:30:46,596 --> 01:31:00,658
[SPEAKER_08]: So apparently some of the stuff at Capcom's booth was supposed to be showing Mega Man Universe with more trailers and game levels, Ghost Trick, Okamiden, Resident Evil 5, Bionic Commando Rearm 2, da da da.

1423
01:31:01,159 --> 01:31:03,359
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't seen a whole lot of information since then.

1424
01:31:03,459 --> 01:31:04,260
[SPEAKER_08]: How about, how about I...

1425
01:31:32,151 --> 01:31:33,812
[SPEAKER_08]: Ah, stinking trailers.

1426
01:31:34,653 --> 01:31:39,297
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I'm getting it, I'm getting it, I'm getting it.

1427
01:31:39,557 --> 01:31:41,839
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, are we ready?

1428
01:31:42,220 --> 01:31:44,442
[SPEAKER_08]: No, we have to go by the sponsor message real quick.

1429
01:31:45,623 --> 01:31:46,924
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's nine seconds, we're good.

1430
01:31:47,564 --> 01:31:49,286
[SPEAKER_03]: I totally forgot whose level I was doing.

1431
01:31:49,706 --> 01:31:51,888
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Metal Man, I think.

1432
01:31:52,169 --> 01:31:52,609
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, here we go.

1433
01:31:55,812 --> 01:31:58,134
[SPEAKER_08]: ESRB, da-da-da, who cares, shut up.

1434
01:32:00,307 --> 01:32:05,348
[SPEAKER_08]: Capcom logo Aren't you all pretty now?

1435
01:32:05,999 --> 01:32:10,903
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, I'm the creator of Mega Man.

1436
01:32:11,023 --> 01:32:19,509
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people who saw the first Mega Man Universe trailer are confused about wondering how this game will play.

1437
01:32:21,630 --> 01:32:25,993
[SPEAKER_08]: Since the trailer didn't reveal all that much, we want to know you, jerk.

1438
01:32:26,333 --> 01:32:28,955
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here to clear up the confusion.

1439
01:32:29,055 --> 01:32:30,436
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

1440
01:32:30,456 --> 01:32:31,677
[SPEAKER_08]: The first playable video

1441
01:32:34,679 --> 01:32:35,939
[SPEAKER_08]: and you can see how it actually works.

1442
01:32:36,020 --> 01:32:36,740
[SPEAKER_08]: Show me already!

1443
01:32:40,061 --> 01:32:42,342
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope this video gets you excited and has you looking forward to more.

1444
01:32:43,462 --> 01:32:43,762
[SPEAKER_08]: Hurry up!

1445
01:32:43,882 --> 01:32:45,503
[SPEAKER_10]: Why are you mad, though?

1446
01:32:46,723 --> 01:32:48,704
[SPEAKER_08]: There we go.

1447
01:32:49,324 --> 01:32:49,945
[SPEAKER_09]: In your arm!

1448
01:32:50,625 --> 01:32:51,645
[SPEAKER_08]: Play us, Rockman.

1449
01:33:00,368 --> 01:33:01,469
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh, the graphics look cool.

1450
01:33:04,761 --> 01:33:05,842
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, isn't that Metal Man's stage?

1451
01:33:05,862 --> 01:33:06,402
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, it is.

1452
01:33:09,805 --> 01:33:10,846
[SPEAKER_10]: That's Fire Man's stage.

1453
01:33:11,947 --> 01:33:12,847
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the select music.

1454
01:33:13,027 --> 01:33:14,528
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the character select music.

1455
01:33:15,129 --> 01:33:15,990
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the stage select.

1456
01:33:19,332 --> 01:33:20,773
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's Crash Man's level.

1457
01:33:20,833 --> 01:33:22,695
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, this is like Mega Man 2 redone.

1458
01:33:23,876 --> 01:33:24,436
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that's new.

1459
01:33:24,996 --> 01:33:26,257
[SPEAKER_08]: A level that says Mega Man.

1460
01:33:27,598 --> 01:33:27,819
[SPEAKER_08]: That's...

1461
01:33:34,181 --> 01:33:35,462
[SPEAKER_00]: Play as Ryu.

1462
01:33:36,122 --> 01:33:36,982
[SPEAKER_00]: No way.

1463
01:33:39,023 --> 01:33:41,064
[SPEAKER_00]: You are Megafight.

1464
01:33:42,125 --> 01:33:44,185
[SPEAKER_08]: He says you're World Megafight.

1465
01:33:44,345 --> 01:33:49,968
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so some of the gameplay looks very Mega Man, but then you see this random Ryu.

1466
01:33:51,789 --> 01:33:52,609
[SPEAKER_08]: What is that all about?

1467
01:33:52,669 --> 01:33:53,690
[SPEAKER_08]: I gotta see if there's more.

1468
01:33:54,970 --> 01:33:55,991
[SPEAKER_08]: Are these all just the same?

1469
01:33:58,292 --> 01:33:59,472
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all the same trailer, I think.

1470
01:34:01,093 --> 01:34:03,254
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh no, they all got different gameplay trailers.

1471
01:34:04,119 --> 01:34:04,499
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh!

1472
01:34:06,300 --> 01:34:08,781
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like different websites got different gameplay trailers.

1473
01:34:10,662 --> 01:34:11,823
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like that's Woodman's level.

1474
01:34:12,023 --> 01:34:13,904
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, it's like a Mega Man 2 upgrade.

1475
01:34:13,924 --> 01:34:16,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Plus some, I think.

1476
01:34:16,405 --> 01:34:22,648
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm gonna play as Ryu, no way.

1477
01:34:22,708 --> 01:34:25,950
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanna see, like, actual one that actually shows.

1478
01:34:25,970 --> 01:34:27,511
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see what this trailer has in it here.

1479
01:34:30,312 --> 01:34:31,713
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're all gonna be Mega Man.

1480
01:34:32,633 --> 01:34:33,514
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god, really?

1481
01:34:36,750 --> 01:34:39,631
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, there's no controls in that one.

1482
01:34:39,671 --> 01:34:41,251
[SPEAKER_00]: I do admit that he's actually really cute.

1483
01:34:41,291 --> 01:34:44,392
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, I'm not going to play that third one because we can't skip through it.

1484
01:34:45,392 --> 01:34:47,393
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, so it's a Mega Man type of game.

1485
01:34:48,573 --> 01:34:50,893
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, so we say there's a triple video out there.

1486
01:34:53,354 --> 01:34:54,634
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm looking at our chat room there.

1487
01:34:56,835 --> 01:34:58,435
[SPEAKER_08]: It shows all three side by side.

1488
01:34:58,735 --> 01:34:59,856
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, let's see if I can get that.

1489
01:35:02,376 --> 01:35:02,696
[SPEAKER_08]: Why not?

1490
01:35:02,736 --> 01:35:04,877
[SPEAKER_08]: We have extra time because of the marathon show.

1491
01:35:04,937 --> 01:35:05,397
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to do...

1492
01:35:08,388 --> 01:35:11,510
Universe Triple Video.

1493
01:35:11,530 --> 01:35:13,531
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, Mega Man Universe Triple Video.

1494
01:35:15,052 --> 01:35:15,512
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't see it.

1495
01:35:17,373 --> 01:35:20,175
[SPEAKER_08]: I see official teaser trailer, which is that same thing we saw before.

1496
01:35:21,336 --> 01:35:23,377
[SPEAKER_01]: This is wonderful radio.

1497
01:35:23,597 --> 01:35:24,257
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, shush.

1498
01:35:28,580 --> 01:35:33,102
[SPEAKER_08]: You would think that they would have actual footage that's shown up from PAX, but I guess not.

1499
01:35:34,343 --> 01:35:35,524
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe it's not out there on the floor.

1500
01:35:35,584 --> 01:35:35,884
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1501
01:35:37,828 --> 01:35:38,649
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, well, whatever.

1502
01:35:39,170 --> 01:35:39,630
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm over it.

1503
01:35:40,391 --> 01:35:41,472
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's move on to some more news.

1504
01:35:41,492 --> 01:35:43,714
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll get more information on this in the coming weeks, I'm sure.

1505
01:35:47,138 --> 01:35:47,679
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.

1506
01:35:48,920 --> 01:35:49,681
[SPEAKER_03]: Other news!

1507
01:35:50,842 --> 01:35:53,705
[SPEAKER_03]: How about EA actually trying to cover their ass?

1508
01:35:55,683 --> 01:36:01,406
[SPEAKER_03]: They're basically trying to defend their whole stupid little online pass deal.

1509
01:36:02,087 --> 01:36:06,630
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a quote out here put by EA Sports dude Peter Moore.

1510
01:36:07,850 --> 01:36:14,174
[SPEAKER_03]: Digital delivery, maintaining servers able to support that volume of people every 24 hours, a solid billing infrastructure and customer support.

1511
01:36:14,514 --> 01:36:17,376
[SPEAKER_03]: It all takes time, effort, and money, and we're at the cutting edge of that.

1512
01:36:17,836 --> 01:36:23,499
[SPEAKER_03]: Online pass is a way of bringing more digital experiences quicker from day one, getting people new content.

1513
01:36:25,401 --> 01:36:27,502
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they're just saying, this shit costs money.

1514
01:36:27,723 --> 01:36:28,503
[SPEAKER_03]: We need more of it.

1515
01:36:29,484 --> 01:36:29,904
[SPEAKER_08]: The end.

1516
01:36:30,024 --> 01:36:31,065
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we all need more money.

1517
01:36:31,125 --> 01:36:31,886
[SPEAKER_08]: I want more money.

1518
01:36:32,026 --> 01:36:36,089
[SPEAKER_08]: EA should give me $10 because I need to have money to buy their games.

1519
01:36:36,109 --> 01:36:37,630
[SPEAKER_03]: They'd have to pay me to play their games.

1520
01:36:38,231 --> 01:36:41,953
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, well, not for Sims 3, but like for, you know, sports games.

1521
01:36:44,235 --> 01:36:44,936
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what they need?

1522
01:36:45,696 --> 01:36:50,420
[SPEAKER_03]: They need, EA needs to put out Wii Figure Skating and you use the balance board.

1523
01:36:52,543 --> 01:36:55,788
[SPEAKER_03]: and you have to balance to do all the tricks right on there with your Wiimotes in your hand.

1524
01:36:55,948 --> 01:36:57,030
[SPEAKER_08]: That sounds hard.

1525
01:36:57,691 --> 01:36:58,412
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be amazing.

1526
01:36:58,793 --> 01:36:59,274
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd play that.

1527
01:36:59,858 --> 01:37:03,501
[SPEAKER_08]: Speaking of amazing, this is probably the most amazing news story we've had all week.

1528
01:37:04,001 --> 01:37:08,524
[SPEAKER_08]: Commodore USA is going to be making modern PCs, but in replica cases.

1529
01:37:08,644 --> 01:37:10,285
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that is, like, so badass.

1530
01:37:11,406 --> 01:37:26,476
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently, the Commodore PC-64 will actually have an Intel Atom 535 processor with NVIDIA Ion 2 graphics, 4 gigabytes of DDR3 RAM, a terabyte hard drive, and a DVD-ROM, optionally upgradable to Blu-ray.

1531
01:37:26,996 --> 01:37:27,877
[SPEAKER_08]: That is so hot.

1532
01:37:28,437 --> 01:37:29,418
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually kind of want one.

1533
01:37:30,158 --> 01:37:33,141
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's in a Commodore 64 replica case so you can party like it's 1983.

1534
01:37:33,821 --> 01:37:37,504
[SPEAKER_08]: That's pretty cool.

1535
01:37:38,465 --> 01:37:39,365
[SPEAKER_08]: Not a lot else with that.

1536
01:37:39,405 --> 01:37:40,966
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't see a price though.

1537
01:37:41,007 --> 01:37:42,908
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the one thing I'd like to see is a price.

1538
01:37:43,969 --> 01:37:44,749
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me see.

1539
01:37:45,150 --> 01:37:46,731
[SPEAKER_08]: Nope, of course they don't say what it is.

1540
01:37:46,771 --> 01:37:49,353
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm looking at the original press release here to see what it looks like.

1541
01:37:50,848 --> 01:37:51,308
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura

1542
01:38:13,223 --> 01:38:14,204
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I have different news.

1543
01:38:15,704 --> 01:38:19,146
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a game that the Burnout developers were going to be making, and do you know what that was?

1544
01:38:20,186 --> 01:38:20,967
[SPEAKER_03]: Skate or Die.

1545
01:38:21,267 --> 01:38:22,147
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you remember Skate or Die?

1546
01:38:23,148 --> 01:38:23,668
[SPEAKER_02]: I sure do.

1547
01:38:23,768 --> 01:38:24,008
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1548
01:38:25,669 --> 01:38:34,073
[SPEAKER_03]: They were going to do it GTA style, apparently, instead of just having it be all tricks and stuff.

1549
01:38:34,093 --> 01:38:37,094
[SPEAKER_08]: That would have been kind of cool.

1550
01:38:37,114 --> 01:38:38,094
[SPEAKER_08]: I wonder why they canned it.

1551
01:38:38,114 --> 01:38:41,396
[SPEAKER_08]: Did they talk about why it got canned or why they decided not to do it or what happened?

1552
01:38:42,250 --> 01:38:51,273
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, EA and Criterion basically got on each other's asses again, and so Criterion then went to do Need for Speed.

1553
01:38:53,814 --> 01:38:57,015
[SPEAKER_03]: And it just looks like it just kind of fell through the cracks.

1554
01:38:58,256 --> 01:38:58,936
[SPEAKER_08]: That sucks.

1555
01:38:59,236 --> 01:39:00,237
[SPEAKER_08]: That could have been kind of cool.

1556
01:39:00,297 --> 01:39:01,637
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember Ski or Die.

1557
01:39:02,457 --> 01:39:04,018
[SPEAKER_08]: That was the quote-unquote sequel.

1558
01:39:04,807 --> 01:39:15,851
[SPEAKER_10]: My BFF in grade school used to get blisters on the palm of his hands, like really gross blisters from playing Skate or Die on his PC, his IBM.

1559
01:39:16,731 --> 01:39:18,371
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I guess I think it was the half pipe.

1560
01:39:19,012 --> 01:39:22,333
[SPEAKER_10]: You had to roll your palm across the number pad to do the flips.

1561
01:39:22,713 --> 01:39:23,973
[SPEAKER_10]: He used to get blisters from that game.

1562
01:39:24,373 --> 01:39:24,973
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my gosh.

1563
01:39:25,353 --> 01:39:25,934
[SPEAKER_08]: Cool story, bro.

1564
01:39:27,509 --> 01:39:28,390
[SPEAKER_01]: That just sounds nasty.

1565
01:39:28,710 --> 01:39:31,493
[SPEAKER_08]: The one I remember, it wasn't Skate or Die.

1566
01:39:31,533 --> 01:39:35,737
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember quite as fondly as I do 720, which was Atari's skating game.

1567
01:39:35,777 --> 01:39:36,798
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you play this, Bradley?

1568
01:39:36,898 --> 01:39:37,358
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, yes.

1569
01:39:37,378 --> 01:39:37,959
[SPEAKER_02]: I played it a bunch.

1570
01:39:38,299 --> 01:39:40,621
[SPEAKER_08]: That's where you get chased by bees if you're not fast enough.

1571
01:39:40,661 --> 01:39:44,465
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually got to play it again at California Extreme.

1572
01:39:44,545 --> 01:39:45,025
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah?

1573
01:39:45,646 --> 01:39:50,050
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was like a hand killer just because spinning the controller a bunch.

1574
01:39:50,836 --> 01:39:52,658
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, because it was all trackball, right?

1575
01:39:52,938 --> 01:39:54,879
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, it's a controller that goes around in a circle.

1576
01:39:55,020 --> 01:40:02,366
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that's right, yeah, the controller's like, but it doesn't stand up, like it's always tilted in one way, so it's really weird to control.

1577
01:40:02,746 --> 01:40:12,314
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well, that's the direction you go in when you skate, so you press the button to kick, and then you're going in the direction that you have the joystick in, and then you spin it around as you need to.

1578
01:40:12,694 --> 01:40:40,480
[SPEAKER_08]: but then you would have these like really epically long levels and it ran on there was a very unique kind of Atari hardware at that time because there's other games that look very similar to it like Hard Drivin' I think is one and the Indiana Jones game was on that same hardware you know there's a bulk of games Atari put out that all kind of ran on that same thing 720 I think it's in some of the Midway classic collections too I do believe you are correct yeah so I don't know why they got oh no because they picked up the Atari arcade assets at some point I think so hmm

1579
01:40:40,979 --> 01:40:42,740
[SPEAKER_02]: I should say, skate or die.

1580
01:40:44,581 --> 01:40:45,022
[SPEAKER_08]: Very cool.

1581
01:40:45,562 --> 01:40:49,644
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the next story, this kind of came up earlier in the show, but I have it listed, so I'll mention this.

1582
01:40:50,025 --> 01:40:54,467
[SPEAKER_08]: Final Fantasy XIV, the beta, was actually delayed a little bit.

1583
01:40:54,507 --> 01:41:02,933
[SPEAKER_08]: It was supposed to start originally on August 31st, but they actually had to delay it a day because of critical bugs and all this stuff.

1584
01:41:03,513 --> 01:41:31,546
[SPEAKER_08]: but here's the crazy thing a lot of people have been having difficulty getting into the open beta there's been limited signups and all this other stuff going on they stopped issuing beta codes they took down the installer altogether it's all crazy September 22nd is supposed to be the launch of this game three weeks this game is supposed to launch that'll go over well I'm sure so I don't know

1585
01:41:32,987 --> 01:41:36,149
[SPEAKER_08]: What made you decide not to get the Final Fantasy XIV beta, Alan?

1586
01:41:37,070 --> 01:41:40,832
[SPEAKER_10]: Watching you play it and your less-than-stellar feedback of it when you played it.

1587
01:41:40,972 --> 01:41:41,612
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, pretty much.

1588
01:41:42,033 --> 01:41:43,213
[SPEAKER_08]: Were you interested in it before?

1589
01:41:43,874 --> 01:41:48,957
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, yeah, I signed up when you did for the... Oh, I thought you were just doing that for me.

1590
01:41:49,397 --> 01:41:55,281
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I'm into WoW now, so I've got enough interest in MMOs to at least check out the competitions.

1591
01:41:56,571 --> 01:41:58,973
[SPEAKER_08]: But you were playing MMOs before, wow, City of Heroes, right?

1592
01:41:59,053 --> 01:42:01,054
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, City of Heroes You never got Going Rogue, did you?

1593
01:42:02,194 --> 01:42:03,075
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you read anything on it?

1594
01:42:04,776 --> 01:42:22,505
[SPEAKER_10]: I checked Metacritic and I think Game Rankings the week it came out and it didn't have anything So I don't think that IGN and all the big review sites have treated it as a priority Maybe now there are some reviews up Well, let's take a look, we have a little time Because it was an actual standalone release, right?

1595
01:42:24,318 --> 01:42:34,423
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, if you buy the Going Rogue Edition, which is like $29.95, if you plug in that license, you have access to the whole game.

1596
01:42:35,664 --> 01:42:36,685
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep, no one's reviewed it yet.

1597
01:42:38,466 --> 01:42:39,106
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, none.

1598
01:42:40,686 --> 01:42:40,986
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

1599
01:42:42,228 --> 01:42:43,108
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess people just don't care.

1600
01:42:43,128 --> 01:42:45,270
[SPEAKER_10]: Still going strong, but its community is really underground.

1601
01:42:45,751 --> 01:42:47,192
[SPEAKER_10]: No one talks about COH anymore.

1602
01:42:47,292 --> 01:42:47,793
[SPEAKER_08]: That's weird.

1603
01:42:49,094 --> 01:42:53,498
[SPEAKER_08]: I see a comment from Ziba in our chatroom saying, I still say Guild Wars 2 for the win.

1604
01:42:55,080 --> 01:42:59,744
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, after looking at that footage, Guild Wars was kind of like, I can kind of take it or leave it.

1605
01:42:59,784 --> 01:43:00,284
[SPEAKER_08]: Guild Wars...

1606
01:43:00,905 --> 01:43:01,526
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1607
01:43:16,323 --> 01:43:39,661
[SPEAKER_08]: then Guild Wars 2 that some of that gameplay footage came out it looks awesome like I gotta say I'm I'm really like it's all actiony and it looks really cool see that's where like MMOs are going these days is more actiony and that's cool I'm really excited about DC Universe Online if I mentioned that where's the beta for that I want to play that all right Dark Sakura more news for us

1608
01:43:40,359 --> 01:43:41,060
[SPEAKER_03]: I do indeed.

1609
01:43:41,760 --> 01:43:47,565

1622
01:45:35,230 --> 01:45:36,271
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's just so far.

1623
01:45:36,472 --> 01:45:38,454
[SPEAKER_03]: People who are going to Tokyo Game Show, get me stuff.

1624
01:45:40,819 --> 01:45:45,381
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd like to go like one day, just once, to say I did it.

1625
01:45:45,481 --> 01:45:48,102
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to go longer than one day, so I can actually spend some time in Japan.

1626
01:45:48,122 --> 01:45:49,822
[SPEAKER_08]: I meant like one day I would like to go, sorry.

1627
01:45:50,582 --> 01:45:51,143
[SPEAKER_08]: For the whole show.

1628
01:45:52,423 --> 01:45:57,425
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, this is another story about some big surprises, and I think this will make Alan very happy.

1629
01:45:58,205 --> 01:46:02,947
[SPEAKER_08]: In an interview with PC Gamer, Gabe Newell from Valve, of course, has said...

1630
01:46:03,687 --> 01:46:07,589
[SPEAKER_08]: I can guarantee you people are going to be surprised at stuff we do.

1631
01:46:08,309 --> 01:46:10,710
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is after he already... Are you rolling your eyes?

1632
01:46:12,370 --> 01:46:16,872
[SPEAKER_08]: This is after they came out and said the whole Steam Cloud support on PS3 and all that good stuff.

1633
01:46:17,292 --> 01:46:20,513
[SPEAKER_08]: But he said, quote, this isn't going to stop anytime soon.

1634
01:46:20,793 --> 01:46:23,755
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just laughing because people will be shocked again.

1635
01:46:24,415 --> 01:46:27,636
[SPEAKER_08]: We have three big surprises in the next 12 months at least.

1636
01:46:30,901 --> 01:46:41,610
[SPEAKER_10]: If you are a Half-Life fan, you really aren't allowed to get mad at Gabe Newell and Valve because if you do, they might keep Half-Life in a closet forever.

1637
01:46:42,431 --> 01:46:44,493
[SPEAKER_10]: It's very much an abusive relationship.

1638
01:46:44,533 --> 01:46:51,018
[SPEAKER_10]: And of course, all of the blogs that are posting this story have a picture of Gordon Freeman in his HEV suit.

1639
01:46:52,139 --> 01:46:54,121
[SPEAKER_10]: I really hope it's something Half-Life.

1640
01:46:55,522 --> 01:47:21,350
[SPEAKER_10]: I Half-Life 2 came out six years ago and it's I hey it took 11 years for Starcraft 2 just saying oh yeah and I I only really play first-person shooters like Bioshock or Half-Life that have that narrative and the story like the cliffhanger at the end of Half-Life 2 episode 2 was so epic it's like it's like I'm a five-year-old on Christmas morning I want that game

1641
01:47:22,259 --> 01:47:31,854
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, there was recently a trademark for Defense of the Ancients, and that of course makes people speculate that there will be a real-time strategy game update to Defense of the Ancients.

1642
01:47:32,114 --> 01:47:33,196
[SPEAKER_08]: So, don't know.

1643
01:47:33,527 --> 01:47:38,551
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, yeah, that's that Warcraft 3 mod that Valve is trying to publish as their own thing.

1644
01:47:38,831 --> 01:47:39,271
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, really?

1645
01:47:39,872 --> 01:47:42,554
[SPEAKER_08]: And Blizzard was like... Oh, that's right, because they hired all those people, huh?

1646
01:47:42,594 --> 01:47:44,175
[SPEAKER_10]: And Blizzard was like, LOL, no.

1647
01:47:44,935 --> 01:47:47,257
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's still in litigation right now.

1648
01:47:47,357 --> 01:47:48,698
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, maybe they'll just change the name.

1649
01:47:48,758 --> 01:47:49,098
[SPEAKER_08]: Who knows?

1650
01:47:50,439 --> 01:47:51,580
[SPEAKER_08]: Be interesting if that happens.

1651
01:47:53,201 --> 01:47:54,142
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe Left 4 Dead 3.

1652
01:47:54,842 --> 01:47:56,223
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure that would be a big surprise.

1653
01:47:56,404 --> 01:47:57,544
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, you're rolling your eyes over there.

1654
01:47:57,584 --> 01:47:57,985
[SPEAKER_08]: I see you.

1655
01:47:58,085 --> 01:47:59,446
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't think I don't see you rolling your eyes.

1656
01:48:01,187 --> 01:48:01,988
[SPEAKER_08]: Not a Left 4 Dead fan?

1657
01:48:03,965 --> 01:48:12,433
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a great game, but I feel that they have other franchises they should focus on more promptly.

1658
01:48:15,135 --> 01:48:16,936
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't want to see a new IP come out of Valve?

1659
01:48:17,197 --> 01:48:17,877
[SPEAKER_08]: The next Portal?

1660
01:48:18,118 --> 01:48:22,301
[SPEAKER_10]: They shouldn't work on a damn thing until the next Half-Life.

1661
01:48:22,341 --> 01:48:23,142
[SPEAKER_10]: They don't know.

1662
01:48:23,202 --> 01:48:23,943
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't want to see Portal 3?

1663
01:48:25,865 --> 01:48:31,916
[SPEAKER_10]: I will go to their office with a ruler and I will slap the little knuckles of their programmer's head and go, what are you working on?

1664
01:48:32,336 --> 01:48:33,138
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not Half-Life.

1665
01:48:33,238 --> 01:48:33,559
[SPEAKER_10]: Wap.

1666
01:48:34,400 --> 01:48:34,761
[SPEAKER_10]: Wap.

1667
01:48:34,841 --> 01:48:36,344
[SPEAKER_10]: And then security will drag me out.

1668
01:48:37,806 --> 01:48:38,628
[SPEAKER_10]: That is how I feel.

1669
01:48:41,743 --> 01:48:43,484
[SPEAKER_10]: How does chat feel about this?

1670
01:48:43,544 --> 01:48:45,504
[SPEAKER_10]: Does chat want their half-life?

1671
01:48:46,384 --> 01:48:49,005
[SPEAKER_10]: Either 3 proper or episode 3 proper?

1672
01:48:49,105 --> 01:49:00,968
[SPEAKER_08]: Monty Boggs in chat says I already forgot how episode 2 ended I should probably go back if they do announce a sequel Floppy Discourse in chat says Left 4 Dead 3 rocks

1673
01:49:03,021 --> 01:49:06,542
[SPEAKER_10]: It probably came out already because they have a six-month development cycle on those games.

1674
01:49:07,763 --> 01:49:09,384
[SPEAKER_08]: But yet Half-Life takes six years.

1675
01:49:10,484 --> 01:49:13,585
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you think they're doing to this game to make it just so... I don't know.

1676
01:49:14,106 --> 01:49:15,346
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess I shouldn't ask these questions.

1677
01:49:15,426 --> 01:49:21,649
[SPEAKER_10]: I read the Half-Life 2 book that came out about how big Half-Life 2 was going to be.

1678
01:49:21,769 --> 01:49:24,430
[SPEAKER_10]: Half-Life 2 for a first-person shooter is a really long game.

1679
01:49:26,691 --> 01:49:52,042
[SPEAKER_10]: all of the conceptual stuff where they want we want this set piece we want this event to happen it was going to be like an 80 hour game and they had to cut out all this stuff so same thing could be happening for Half-Life 3 RedRotainment in chat says I wanted Half-Life 2 years ago DarkCircuitry says more Half-Life heart and DarkTetsuya says no there's only one game I'm looking forward to in the immediate future and it's on the Wii

1680
01:49:52,864 --> 01:49:54,406
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm guessing that's the La Mulana game.

1681
01:49:54,426 --> 01:49:55,347
[SPEAKER_08]: Didn't that already come out?

1682
01:49:55,608 --> 01:49:57,250
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I guess it's still in the future.

1683
01:49:57,711 --> 01:49:58,031
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1684
01:49:58,812 --> 01:50:07,144
[SPEAKER_08]: Hoseo Sumiuragawa is looking forward a little more to the Final Fantasy VII remake that still has not been announced and probably is never going to be.

1685
01:50:08,977 --> 01:50:19,826
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm really disappointed that we haven't heard anything about a DS or even DS 3D, 3DS, Final Fantasy 5 or Final Fantasy 6.

1686
01:50:21,447 --> 01:50:23,188
[SPEAKER_10]: You know how they remade the SNES ones.

1687
01:50:23,228 --> 01:50:24,890
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, Final Fantasy 4 was awesome.

1688
01:50:25,030 --> 01:50:25,931
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it was amazing.

1689
01:50:26,791 --> 01:50:30,855
[SPEAKER_10]: I think 6 might be too big of a game, but they could do 5, it would sell really well here.

1690
01:50:31,776 --> 01:50:32,056
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1691
01:50:33,200 --> 01:50:33,300
[SPEAKER_08]: Or 6.

1692
01:50:33,560 --> 01:50:37,804
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, don't take this the wrong way, but fuck 5.

1693
01:50:37,944 --> 01:50:40,426
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, 6 is really where it's at.

1694
01:50:40,486 --> 01:50:48,393
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, you know, again, to put the hate mail down, I still like Final Fantasy 5, but it's just Final Fantasy 6 is like, it's way up here.

1695
01:50:48,854 --> 01:50:51,136
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, Final Fantasy 5 is vanilla ice cream.

1696
01:50:51,156 --> 01:50:55,059
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, it's good, and I'm not gonna turn it down, and it's like, you know, it's cool.

1697
01:50:55,420 --> 01:50:57,521
[SPEAKER_08]: But Final Fantasy 6... Final Fantasy 6?

1698
01:50:57,782 --> 01:50:58,322
[SPEAKER_08]: Final Fantasy 6...

1699
01:50:59,503 --> 01:51:02,666
[SPEAKER_08]: is like peanut butter cups and chocolate ice cream.

1700
01:51:02,806 --> 01:51:07,110
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like words I shouldn't say on the radio.

1701
01:51:07,230 --> 01:51:07,430
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1702
01:51:08,832 --> 01:51:09,112
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1703
01:51:09,873 --> 01:51:10,613
[SPEAKER_08]: We're at what time?

1704
01:51:10,653 --> 01:51:11,254
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, we're at 745.

1705
01:51:11,394 --> 01:51:12,115
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we need a break then?

1706
01:51:12,600 --> 01:51:13,982
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because the place closes at 9.

1707
01:51:14,523 --> 01:51:17,046
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, let's break after that story.

1708
01:51:17,486 --> 01:51:19,128
[SPEAKER_08]: And we'll come back and we'll do a few more.

1709
01:51:19,569 --> 01:51:21,151
[SPEAKER_08]: No, you guys are going to do Ask Orange Lounge, right?

1710
01:51:21,171 --> 01:51:22,132
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we're going to do Ask Orange Lounge.

1711
01:51:22,152 --> 01:51:23,354
[SPEAKER_08]: But they should send them to you.

1712
01:51:23,374 --> 01:51:23,754
[SPEAKER_08]: To me.

1713
01:51:24,595 --> 01:51:26,878
[SPEAKER_08]: So you're going to Ask Orange Lounge with Dark Sakura.

1714
01:51:26,998 --> 01:51:28,380
[SPEAKER_03]: Via private message.

1715
01:51:28,500 --> 01:51:30,423
[SPEAKER_08]: And the Skype line will also be open for you guys.

1716
01:51:30,743 --> 01:51:31,243
[SPEAKER_08]: if you want to do that.

1717
01:51:31,283 --> 01:51:32,844
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'll come over.

1718
01:51:33,104 --> 01:51:33,644
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, sounds good.

1719
01:51:34,485 --> 01:51:40,287
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm going to, we're going to take a quick music break while we order dinner and then we're going to come back and do some Ask Orange Lounge.

1720
01:51:40,307 --> 01:51:41,768
[SPEAKER_08]: So send your questions again, not me.

1721
01:51:41,848 --> 01:51:44,289
[SPEAKER_08]: They won't get ready if you send them to me, DarkSakura in our chat room.

1722
01:51:44,669 --> 01:51:47,791
[SPEAKER_08]: Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send in some questions.

1723
01:51:48,031 --> 01:51:50,872
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to take a quick break but we'll be right back with the Orange Lounge Radio.

1724
01:51:51,372 --> 01:51:52,413
[SPEAKER_08]: Marathon Show

1725
01:52:13,434 --> 01:52:14,174
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a little different.

1726
01:52:14,374 --> 01:52:17,355
[SPEAKER_08]: You may have missed last week's show where we told you guys we're going to be doing something special this week.

1727
01:52:17,955 --> 01:52:19,295
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki has already come and gone.

1728
01:52:19,355 --> 01:52:25,717
[SPEAKER_08]: He was here at 2 o'clock for the quote-unquote normal show that went until about 5.30 and now we're kind of in the bonus portion.

1729
01:52:26,057 --> 01:52:30,798
[SPEAKER_08]: But now that we are getting into the really random stuff, we actually have to eat.

1730
01:52:30,838 --> 01:52:32,318
[SPEAKER_08]: We kind of have to stop to eat.

1731
01:52:33,158 --> 01:52:34,238
[SPEAKER_08]: But we're not going to stop the marathon.

1732
01:52:34,378 --> 01:52:37,199
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm actually going to run out and get what's called take-and-bake pizzas.

1733
01:52:37,259 --> 01:52:41,480
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm going to get pizzas and then we'll switch off and Jamie's actually going to bake them while we do some other topics.

1734
01:52:42,180 --> 01:52:43,101
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to bake them.

1735
01:52:43,841 --> 01:52:44,521
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you're the woman.

1736
01:52:46,922 --> 01:52:47,623
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll help.

1737
01:52:48,343 --> 01:52:49,123
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew it was coming.

1738
01:52:49,143 --> 01:52:50,984
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to burn down your house either.

1739
01:52:51,024 --> 01:52:52,325
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what it really boils down to.

1740
01:52:52,665 --> 01:52:53,525
[SPEAKER_08]: But we'll figure something out.

1741
01:52:53,545 --> 01:52:55,926
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll play some Talking Heads while Rob cooks.

1742
01:52:56,187 --> 01:52:57,447
[SPEAKER_03]: Burning down the house.

1743
01:52:57,547 --> 01:53:02,069
[SPEAKER_08]: So anyway, I'm going to step out to go do that, but Dark Sakura is going to take over.

1744
01:53:02,309 --> 01:53:03,090
[SPEAKER_08]: God help you all.

1745
01:53:04,010 --> 01:53:06,091
[SPEAKER_08]: And do some Ask Orange Lounge, right?

1746
01:53:06,471 --> 01:53:07,452
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1747
01:53:07,852 --> 01:53:10,213
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, it wouldn't be Ask Orange Lounge if we didn't have a theme song, right?

1748
01:53:12,961 --> 01:53:13,981
[SPEAKER_03]: We could do a duet, Ranma.

1749
01:53:14,241 --> 01:53:14,501
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1750
01:53:14,601 --> 01:53:14,761
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1751
01:53:17,022 --> 01:53:19,943
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.

1752
01:53:20,483 --> 01:53:23,723
[SPEAKER_08]: What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?

1753
01:53:24,404 --> 01:53:31,125
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't ask me any questions because I'm leaving this house because I know how this segment can sometimes go.

1754
01:53:32,325 --> 01:53:34,106
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought you were going to say sometimes suck.

1755
01:53:37,386 --> 01:53:38,687
[SPEAKER_08]: Do I look like Wayne Brady?

1756
01:53:38,807 --> 01:53:39,968
[SPEAKER_08]: Do I sing improv songs on command?

1757
01:53:39,988 --> 01:53:44,051
[SPEAKER_03]: Make like two live crew and get the fuck out my house, bitch.

1758
01:53:44,471 --> 01:53:46,553
[SPEAKER_08]: Sky says do the live feed while getting pizza.

1759
01:53:46,633 --> 01:53:47,794
[SPEAKER_08]: I could do the Ustream.

1760
01:53:48,214 --> 01:53:50,155
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm not going to do that and drive at the same time.

1761
01:53:50,175 --> 01:53:50,856
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys are crazy.

1762
01:53:51,977 --> 01:53:52,357
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm out.

1763
01:53:52,517 --> 01:53:55,419
[SPEAKER_03]: I would be forced to yell at Rob for doing something dumb.

1764
01:53:55,579 --> 01:53:56,200
[SPEAKER_03]: Be good, kids.

1765
01:53:56,520 --> 01:53:56,900
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be back.

1766
01:53:57,721 --> 01:53:58,101
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1767
01:53:59,622 --> 01:54:01,163
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, chatlings, let's see.

1768
01:54:01,983 --> 01:54:05,884
[SPEAKER_03]: Haseo Sumiragawa, what's the story with the orange bat?

1769
01:54:06,084 --> 01:54:06,745
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, shit.

1770
01:54:09,285 --> 01:54:17,128
[SPEAKER_03]: The orange bat came from March Madness, which was a DDR tournament that they held at Milpitas Golf Land.

1771
01:54:17,949 --> 01:54:24,691
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was me and Rob and Jessica and...

1772
01:54:26,903 --> 01:54:31,865
[SPEAKER_03]: At the time, her fiancé, and I think, and somebody else who was with us, I don't remember.

1773
01:54:32,605 --> 01:54:40,107
[SPEAKER_03]: But we decided that we were just sick of all the people not really doing actual routines when they were doing their thing.

1774
01:54:40,127 --> 01:54:50,351
[SPEAKER_03]: So we actually went and got plastic orange bats and little toy trumpets and stomped them a beat.

1775
01:54:51,511 --> 01:54:56,353
[SPEAKER_03]: And Rob and I proceeded to hit each other over the head with bats while the others played the trumpets.

1776
01:54:57,853 --> 01:54:58,514
[SPEAKER_03]: and it was epic.

1777
01:54:59,174 --> 01:55:05,159
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the bat went around and was signed and I think Rob has his bat and then I have my bat.

1778
01:55:05,660 --> 01:55:11,585
[SPEAKER_03]: And my bat, I got signed by everyone in Step Squad and RTF, as many people as I could.

1779
01:55:13,086 --> 01:55:17,230
[SPEAKER_03]: The bat is in my garage right now.

1780
01:55:18,131 --> 01:55:19,612
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the story of the orange bat.

1781
01:55:21,133 --> 01:55:21,173
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

1782
01:55:24,329 --> 01:55:30,752
[SPEAKER_03]: Dark Circuitry asks, which is the better game in your guys' opinion, Pump It Up Pro or In The Groove?

1783
01:55:32,413 --> 01:55:32,873
[SPEAKER_03]: Pump It Up.

1784
01:55:34,374 --> 01:55:35,855
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, dude, caution drop.

1785
01:55:37,296 --> 01:55:37,436
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1786
01:55:38,757 --> 01:55:39,897
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not a big fan of In The Groove.

1787
01:55:39,997 --> 01:55:40,437
[SPEAKER_03]: It's okay.

1788
01:55:40,557 --> 01:55:41,158
[SPEAKER_03]: It's playable.

1789
01:55:41,358 --> 01:55:44,399
[SPEAKER_03]: But Pump It Up, they're just different types.

1790
01:55:44,700 --> 01:55:47,281
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, same theory, yes, but different.

1791
01:55:48,666 --> 01:55:50,408
[SPEAKER_03]: Type of game, if that makes sense.

1792
01:55:50,869 --> 01:55:56,035
[SPEAKER_10]: Pump It Up is one of the more major DDR clones where it's the diagonals.

1793
01:55:56,255 --> 01:55:57,497
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the five square one.

1794
01:55:57,847 --> 01:56:05,752
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I tried playing that once, and I was so in the mindset of DDR that I made it through like two songs, and it basically broke me.

1795
01:56:06,112 --> 01:56:09,454
[SPEAKER_10]: Like the different mechanics of the diagonals, I couldn't do it.

1796
01:56:10,174 --> 01:56:10,995
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't touch it since.

1797
01:56:11,195 --> 01:56:14,197
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know people who are really, really good at it who do doubles on them.

1798
01:56:14,737 --> 01:56:26,364
[SPEAKER_03]: But I just remembered how the caution drop used to work on that, is that you'd follow the diagonal, your knee would hit the middle, and then your foot would hit the top of the back, and then you'd slap the bottom two on those for...

1799
01:56:26,684 --> 01:56:27,245
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh wow.

1800
01:56:28,047 --> 01:56:31,053
[SPEAKER_03]: They had stuff where you had to hit all five buttons and it was really difficult.

1801
01:56:31,313 --> 01:56:35,061
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah.

1802
01:56:36,624 --> 01:56:37,145
[SPEAKER_03]: Ranma!

1803
01:56:37,606 --> 01:56:38,006
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

1804
01:56:39,369 --> 01:56:45,070
[SPEAKER_03]: During OLRthon, how about firing up the Wii for multiplayer Mario Kart or the 360 for Rock Band 2?

1805
01:56:45,711 --> 01:57:02,335
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's because Dan and Alex have taken over the front room and are shooting each other stupid in a first person, well, not a first person, but in a shooting game, a shmup against each other that we will not mention the name of in this house because it's not here.

1806
01:57:02,355 --> 01:57:03,875
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?

1807
01:57:03,895 --> 01:57:04,075
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

1808
01:57:04,932 --> 01:57:06,774
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the target time?

1809
01:57:06,874 --> 01:57:07,014
[SPEAKER_03]: 1am?

1810
01:57:07,034 --> 01:57:07,094
[SPEAKER_03]: 2am?

1811
01:57:26,340 --> 01:57:32,847
[SPEAKER_03]: Midnight is the baseline, I think Hoof Hearted, I guess you like horses, huh?

1812
01:57:33,548 --> 01:57:42,719
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's Spazinator Your thought on this It's a 1TB hard drive for $80

1813
01:57:46,445 --> 01:57:47,426
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, go for it.

1814
01:57:48,186 --> 01:57:52,650
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not, it doesn't, transfer at 480 megabytes per second, plug and play.

1815
01:57:53,991 --> 01:57:55,292
[SPEAKER_03]: Not bad, it's not great.

1816
01:57:55,532 --> 01:58:02,397
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, not like the super most awesome thing in the universe, but hey, cheap terabyte hard drive, why not?

1817
01:58:03,066 --> 01:58:17,096
[SPEAKER_10]: I think last January or February I got a terabyte external FireWire USB thing like that for about $110 just to show how cheap hard drive space is becoming, but I use it as my MP3 slash torrents drive.

1818
01:58:17,997 --> 01:58:24,422
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I've actually filled up my $500 gig with MP3s and movies and stuff.

1819
01:58:24,662 --> 01:58:24,882
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1820
01:58:25,963 --> 01:58:28,805
[SPEAKER_03]: And a whole bunch of obscure Japanese Sentai TV.

1821
01:58:30,658 --> 01:58:31,978
[SPEAKER_10]: I like my Tower Rangers!

1822
01:58:31,998 --> 01:58:33,159
[SPEAKER_10]: I think your mic's cutting out.

1823
01:58:33,959 --> 01:58:34,059
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah!

1824
01:58:34,739 --> 01:58:35,379
[SPEAKER_03]: No cutting out, mic.

1825
01:58:35,399 --> 01:58:35,860
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not allowed.

1826
01:58:37,640 --> 01:58:41,501
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, next question, and thank you, Spazinator.

1827
01:58:41,701 --> 01:58:43,362
[SPEAKER_03]: That looks like it would be a decent purchase.

1828
01:58:44,262 --> 01:58:47,403
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, floppy discourse?

1829
01:58:49,623 --> 01:58:49,783
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah!

1830
01:58:49,903 --> 01:58:50,444
[SPEAKER_03]: Funny!

1831
01:58:50,584 --> 01:58:51,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Floppy discourse.

1832
01:58:52,144 --> 01:58:52,404
[SPEAKER_03]: Ha.

1833
01:58:53,024 --> 01:58:54,525
[SPEAKER_03]: When is Final Fantasy XIV coming out?

1834
01:58:54,645 --> 01:58:55,485
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know and I don't care.

1835
01:58:57,330 --> 01:59:02,911
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the PC date is, I think Rob just said it, the 23rd, 24th, three weeks.

1836
01:59:03,531 --> 01:59:06,952
[SPEAKER_10]: We're supposed to have 14 available for PC in three weeks.

1837
01:59:08,752 --> 01:59:13,253
[SPEAKER_03]: I've completely lost interest in the Final Fantasy online series.

1838
01:59:13,273 --> 01:59:14,113
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gorgeous.

1839
01:59:14,554 --> 01:59:14,914
[SPEAKER_10]: Beautiful.

1840
01:59:15,334 --> 01:59:17,954
[SPEAKER_03]: But pretty does not necessarily mean good.

1841
01:59:19,615 --> 01:59:21,555
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm happy with my Star Trek.

1842
01:59:21,863 --> 01:59:24,165
[SPEAKER_10]: What was the first video game you ever played in your life?

1843
01:59:24,185 --> 01:59:28,027
[SPEAKER_10]: Pinball tables don't count, but feel free to say what those are too if you remember.

1844
01:59:48,496 --> 01:59:49,697
[SPEAKER_03]: My first video game.

1845
01:59:50,497 --> 01:59:50,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Pong.

1846
01:59:51,437 --> 01:59:51,977
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously.

1847
01:59:53,238 --> 01:59:54,999
[SPEAKER_03]: I played Pong when I was little.

1848
01:59:56,039 --> 02:00:00,181
[SPEAKER_03]: And then later on we went on to Kangaroo and Popeye and Donkey Kong.

1849
02:00:03,742 --> 02:00:05,983
[SPEAKER_10]: I got an Atari 2600 when I was 4 or 5.

1850
02:00:06,383 --> 02:00:06,743
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1851
02:00:06,803 --> 02:00:07,884
[SPEAKER_10]: So any one of those games.

1852
02:00:08,004 --> 02:00:08,844
[SPEAKER_10]: Probably Pac-Man.

1853
02:00:09,845 --> 02:00:11,365
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, the Pac-Man version was awful though.

1854
02:00:11,385 --> 02:00:13,146
[SPEAKER_10]: But not as bad as E.T.? ?

1855
02:00:17,150 --> 02:00:18,631
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep, and I played the hell out of that game.

1856
02:00:18,811 --> 02:00:20,992
[SPEAKER_10]: Because when you're seven, you don't really have taste.

1857
02:00:22,293 --> 02:00:25,595
[SPEAKER_02]: With that Pac-Man, I don't know if it was a setting or something.

1858
02:00:26,836 --> 02:00:31,479
[SPEAKER_02]: After a while, it was a weird thing where the power pellet moved to somewhere else other than the middle of the board.

1859
02:00:32,259 --> 02:00:34,320
[SPEAKER_02]: I had no idea how it happened.

1860
02:00:35,781 --> 02:00:36,842
[SPEAKER_03]: Programming glitch?

1861
02:00:37,342 --> 02:00:39,483
[SPEAKER_02]: The first thing I played, I remember, was when I got the...

1862
02:00:41,517 --> 02:00:45,161
[SPEAKER_02]: Atari 2600 for like, I think it was fourth Christmas when I was like four.

1863
02:00:45,401 --> 02:00:47,063
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we played Asteroids first.

1864
02:00:47,924 --> 02:00:54,731
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I remember the big splashy colored asteroids floating around the screen.

1865
02:00:55,292 --> 02:00:55,952
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty cool.

1866
02:00:56,573 --> 02:00:58,115
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good game to have as your first.

1867
02:00:58,675 --> 02:00:59,636
[SPEAKER_03]: Pong is kind of boring.

1868
02:01:00,878 --> 02:01:01,158
[SPEAKER_03]: Pong.

1869
02:01:01,819 --> 02:01:02,059
Pong.

1870
02:01:02,880 --> 02:01:03,040
Pong.

1871
02:01:06,997 --> 02:01:16,147
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, well, as far as pinball tables, I played all kinds of pinball when I was a kid, so it's really hard to remember.

1872
02:01:16,167 --> 02:01:19,190
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the first one I remember playing was, my dad had one called Genie.

1873
02:01:20,371 --> 02:01:21,412
[SPEAKER_02]: No, which one?

1874
02:01:21,552 --> 02:01:22,293
[SPEAKER_02]: It was called Genie.

1875
02:01:22,574 --> 02:01:24,756
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I know, one of the 50s ones or 60s ones?

1876
02:01:24,776 --> 02:01:26,838
[SPEAKER_02]: Something like that, I don't really know.

1877
02:01:27,078 --> 02:01:28,600
[SPEAKER_03]: Little rotating numbers.

1878
02:01:30,790 --> 02:01:31,611
[SPEAKER_02]: Found it by Gottlieb

1879
02:01:49,654 --> 02:01:56,039
[SPEAKER_03]: Genie, 1979, 4 player, and it is indeed electronic.

1880
02:01:56,379 --> 02:01:56,759
[SPEAKER_03]: Was that it?

1881
02:01:57,099 --> 02:01:57,640
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, that's it.

1882
02:01:58,640 --> 02:02:04,484
[SPEAKER_02]: And it played like the place in France where the Naked Ladies dance.

1883
02:02:07,767 --> 02:02:10,429
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a hole in the wall where the guys can see their mom.

1884
02:02:10,829 --> 02:02:12,950
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was just a track sound.

1885
02:02:13,531 --> 02:02:14,892
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll link that in the chat room.

1886
02:02:14,912 --> 02:02:14,952
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

1887
02:02:18,570 --> 02:02:22,531
[SPEAKER_02]: I was hoping I might see it at the California stream, but no, they didn't have it.

1888
02:02:22,991 --> 02:02:28,913
[SPEAKER_03]: You might be able to find it, though, when they do that other pinball expo, Pacific Pinball Expo.

1889
02:02:29,653 --> 02:02:31,854
[SPEAKER_03]: They might have them there because they usually have older tables there.

1890
02:02:36,355 --> 02:02:41,037
[SPEAKER_03]: But I really can't remember what my first pinball was and it was something old.

1891
02:02:41,977 --> 02:02:44,698
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, what's your first video game you've played in roller skates?

1892
02:02:46,718 --> 02:02:47,979
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

1893
02:03:01,047 --> 02:03:01,407
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

1894
02:03:30,287 --> 02:03:36,471
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, when I would go visit my dad in Dothan, Alabama, the roller rink there was called Bobaloo.

1895
02:03:37,271 --> 02:03:41,333
[SPEAKER_03]: And Bob, who was the owner, he'd since passed away, and his wife was Lou.

1896
02:03:42,314 --> 02:03:48,878
[SPEAKER_03]: But Bob was friends with my granddaddy, and they taught amateur skating, like figure skating with roller skates.

1897
02:03:49,738 --> 02:04:14,850
[SPEAKER_03]: and so I would always go up there and just go hang out and talk and talk about granddaddy but they had the same Frogger machine there while I was growing up and it was still always in good working condition the joystick was a little sticky but it was the same Frogger machine and I played that same machine for easily 10 years so anyway so how about more questions huh?

1898
02:04:16,923 --> 02:04:19,745
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and Tiara wants to add Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles at the roller rink.

1899
02:04:21,566 --> 02:04:37,414
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember when to play an arcade game it was either the arcade when they still existed or the pizza parlor arcade games there or I remember when Street Fighter 2 came out everyone went to 7-Eleven to play it when 7-Eleven actually had arcade cabinets.

1900
02:04:37,964 --> 02:04:42,567
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, we did go to the... I don't know if it was 7-Eleven, but it was some sort of convenience store.

1901
02:04:42,587 --> 02:04:48,171
[SPEAKER_02]: Or like Circle K. Everyone go play Street Fighter 2 at the Circle K. This is out in South Carolina, so I don't remember what it was called.

1902
02:04:48,371 --> 02:04:50,172
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember my high school band trip, though.

1903
02:04:50,332 --> 02:04:53,014
[SPEAKER_03]: When we went to New York, we drove up.

1904
02:04:53,334 --> 02:04:54,655
[SPEAKER_03]: We actually stopped in Washington, D.C.

1905
02:04:54,675 --> 02:04:55,796
[SPEAKER_03]: and then went on up to New York.

1906
02:04:56,496 --> 02:04:58,538
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was when Mortal Kombat 2 was in beta testing.

1907
02:04:59,778 --> 02:05:27,926
[SPEAKER_03]: with all the glitches and the continuous things so we were just Mortal Kombat and the guys would just play it instead of eat but I would play that too because I loved Mortal Kombat and I was really good with Katana but that was that's probably one of my favorite high school video game memories I think other than me letting out a very loud curse while I was playing Zelda Link to the Past while my mom was in the other room oops

1908
02:05:30,427 --> 02:05:33,369
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so, ooh, Red Entertainment asked a doozy.

1909
02:05:34,430 --> 02:05:40,233
[SPEAKER_03]: Which place is more openly hostile to outsiders and those who don't conform to the, quote, norm?

1910
02:05:40,814 --> 02:05:41,894
[SPEAKER_03]: Alabama or Utah?

1911
02:05:42,335 --> 02:05:43,375
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never been to Utah.

1912
02:05:43,816 --> 02:05:55,063
[SPEAKER_03]: People are fairly nice in Alabama unless you just say they're very, like, people try, they tend to be nice unless they're just super backwards rednecks, I guess.

1913
02:05:55,083 --> 02:05:55,823
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1914
02:05:56,884 --> 02:05:57,705
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't tell you about Utah.

1915
02:05:57,725 --> 02:05:58,185
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never been.

1916
02:06:00,427 --> 02:06:01,467
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyone here been to Utah?

1917
02:06:01,747 --> 02:06:03,828
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been through there, but I haven't really dealt with the people that much.

1918
02:06:04,348 --> 02:06:06,329
[SPEAKER_02]: I was actually there for a day and a half, too.

1919
02:06:06,989 --> 02:06:07,169
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1920
02:06:09,070 --> 02:06:09,710
[SPEAKER_02]: Couldn't really tell.

1921
02:06:09,730 --> 02:06:11,571
[SPEAKER_02]: I think everyone's got their bad places.

1922
02:06:11,991 --> 02:06:13,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it just depends on who you run into.

1923
02:06:14,852 --> 02:06:23,635
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, don't go, like, wearing a I voted for Perot shirt in, you know, Alabama or something.

1924
02:06:24,375 --> 02:06:26,396
[SPEAKER_03]: Or I miss Bill Clinton.

1925
02:06:27,456 --> 02:06:27,656
[SPEAKER_03]: You know?

1926
02:06:30,265 --> 02:06:31,606
[SPEAKER_03]: Last comes from DarkTetsuya.

1927
02:06:32,266 --> 02:06:34,847
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we resurrect Name That Tune now that we have time, that is?

1928
02:06:35,568 --> 02:06:35,688
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1929
02:06:37,669 --> 02:06:40,030
[SPEAKER_03]: Not until Rob gets back anyway, because then Rob can do all that for us.

1930
02:06:41,431 --> 02:06:48,835
[SPEAKER_03]: See, we're a little lazy right now, and we're just sort of leaning back and... Ooh, chit-chat.

1931
02:06:48,975 --> 02:06:50,475
[SPEAKER_03]: People, send me more questions, damn it!

1932
02:06:52,176 --> 02:06:53,137
[SPEAKER_10]: Comment from chat.

1933
02:06:53,157 --> 02:06:55,358
[SPEAKER_02]: See if we can figure out what a game is from a description.

1934
02:06:56,317 --> 02:06:58,099
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you ever play the Odyssey 2?

1935
02:06:58,159 --> 02:06:58,239
[SPEAKER_03]: No

1936
02:07:24,333 --> 02:07:25,013
[SPEAKER_03]: We actually have one.

1937
02:07:25,054 --> 02:07:26,734
[SPEAKER_03]: We do not have a TV that it will run on.

1938
02:07:26,754 --> 02:07:28,575
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's that old.

1939
02:07:28,915 --> 02:07:31,417
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it have Venture as one of the games on it?

1940
02:07:31,557 --> 02:07:35,659
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it had Venture, but it had this... Oh, that was ColecoVision.

1941
02:07:35,819 --> 02:07:37,860
[SPEAKER_03]: It had Casey's Crazy Chase and Casey Munchkin.

1942
02:07:39,321 --> 02:07:41,282
[SPEAKER_03]: Crazy Chase was the clone of Pac-Man.

1943
02:07:41,882 --> 02:07:44,163
[SPEAKER_03]: And they got sued and had to bury all these copies.

1944
02:07:44,183 --> 02:07:46,304
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you have a copy of Casey Munchkin, it's kind of rare.

1945
02:07:46,984 --> 02:07:48,545
[SPEAKER_03]: Which I think I've got two copies now.

1946
02:07:48,605 --> 02:07:49,366
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I never played it.

1947
02:07:50,086 --> 02:07:51,168
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

1948
02:07:58,157 --> 02:07:59,158
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to say 85 or 86.

1949
02:07:59,998 --> 02:08:05,001
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so then I was... If it was 85, I was 9 then.

1950
02:08:05,942 --> 02:08:07,283
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, yeah, I would have been 9.

1951
02:08:08,363 --> 02:08:11,525
[SPEAKER_03]: But, yeah, my next-door neighbor had a ColecoVision.

1952
02:08:12,005 --> 02:08:18,889
[SPEAKER_03]: And we would play this racing game and Casey Crazy Chase and a game called CryptoQuip.

1953
02:08:19,550 --> 02:08:22,492
[SPEAKER_03]: Where you put in a phrase and scramble them up and you had to guess what it is.

1954
02:08:22,732 --> 02:08:24,273
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was really good at those word scrambles.

1955
02:08:25,573 --> 02:08:54,143
[SPEAKER_03]: but there was another game where you could play as a warrior or a mage or some other person and then a changeling which you could turn into invisible and go through and it was like this you had to get from one side to the other and get the treasure and then it was this weird bizarre game I'm trying to remember the name of it so this is what kind of what I was asking is there's a lot of good games that I used to play and I just can't remember the names of them anymore it's been so long

1956
02:08:55,632 --> 02:08:59,034
[SPEAKER_10]: What was the first RPG that you really invested in and finished?

1957
02:08:59,154 --> 02:09:03,036
[SPEAKER_10]: Like you saw the ending and you had 30 hours logged or however long it took.

1958
02:09:03,557 --> 02:09:04,217
[SPEAKER_10]: First RPG.

1959
02:09:05,138 --> 02:09:05,618
[SPEAKER_10]: Video game.

1960
02:09:07,919 --> 02:09:10,921
[SPEAKER_03]: I would almost say Final Fantasy except I really lost interest.

1961
02:09:11,721 --> 02:09:17,705
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to go with... I know it was on the Nintendo and I'm trying to remember what it was.

1962
02:09:20,046 --> 02:09:21,127
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't StarTropics.

1963
02:09:21,207 --> 02:09:21,487
[SPEAKER_03]: It was...

1964
02:09:23,683 --> 02:09:51,938
[SPEAKER_03]: and I can't really put Zelda in it too because Zelda was more well yeah let's eliminate Zelda from this because that's more adventure maybe it was StarTropics it's been a long time is StarTropics or Faxana do or something like that so mine was Dragon Warrior 1 and then Final Fantasy 1 shortly after that on the NES so

1965
02:09:53,430 --> 02:09:55,092
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, mine was Phantasy Star.

1966
02:09:55,693 --> 02:09:57,975
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, for the most part, I was actually watching my friend play it.

1967
02:09:58,035 --> 02:10:06,085
[SPEAKER_02]: He actually got a, I don't know if he called up Sega or something, they sent him a cheat sheet to walk through the game so that we could figure out how to get through it.

1968
02:10:06,285 --> 02:10:06,765
[SPEAKER_09]: That's pretty cool.

1969
02:10:07,126 --> 02:10:09,448
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was a really fun game.

1970
02:10:10,686 --> 02:10:30,676
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's kind of funny about that game is that when I play, because it kind of scrolls kind of with six frames between the thing, between when you're in the dungeon phase, that when you play like Shining in the Darkness on Genesis, it only does a three frame thing, so it looks kind of, going between those two is kind of weird.

1971
02:10:32,077 --> 02:10:34,459
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a question from Ake Ripper.

1972
02:10:34,479 --> 02:10:36,501
[SPEAKER_02]: What's what the next Sims expansion is going to be about?

1973
02:10:37,461 --> 02:10:39,223
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not counting Light Knight.

1974
02:10:39,243 --> 02:10:40,844
[SPEAKER_02]: Aren't they doing like a Cars one?

1975
02:10:59,622 --> 02:11:00,063
[SPEAKER_10]: For Sims 4?

1976
02:11:00,163 --> 02:11:00,403
[SPEAKER_10]: Sims 3.

1977
02:11:01,424 --> 02:11:02,286
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, Sims 3, that's right.

1978
02:11:02,666 --> 02:11:03,567
[SPEAKER_10]: I think your mic cut out again.

1979
02:11:03,928 --> 02:11:05,129
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, how about that?

1980
02:11:05,249 --> 02:11:05,590
[SPEAKER_03]: There it goes.

1981
02:11:06,071 --> 02:11:07,973
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't really exactly remember what it is.

1982
02:11:08,013 --> 02:11:11,057
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought that they were doing like a vehicle-related one.

1983
02:11:11,197 --> 02:11:12,139
[SPEAKER_03]: I can find out, I guess.

1984
02:11:12,960 --> 02:11:13,200
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go.

1985
02:11:16,647 --> 02:11:18,928
[SPEAKER_10]: I never really got into The Sims.

1986
02:11:19,268 --> 02:11:26,689
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember I tried Sims 1 a year or two after it was out and it had already become a worldwide phenomenon.

1987
02:11:27,230 --> 02:11:29,430
[SPEAKER_10]: I fussed with it for a couple hours.

1988
02:11:29,610 --> 02:11:32,071
[SPEAKER_10]: I never got it.

1989
02:11:32,131 --> 02:11:33,091
[SPEAKER_10]: I never figured it out.

1990
02:11:34,911 --> 02:11:37,172
[SPEAKER_03]: The only thing on here is just late night.

1991
02:11:37,832 --> 02:11:40,052
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing really after that.

1992
02:11:40,572 --> 02:11:42,453
[SPEAKER_03]: At least it's listed anyway.

1993
02:11:42,853 --> 02:11:43,933
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey dude, nightclubs.

1994
02:11:45,618 --> 02:11:48,621
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be so cool if you can have gay dancing in The Sims.

1995
02:11:49,622 --> 02:11:50,182
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be fun.

1996
02:11:51,924 --> 02:11:53,726
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wonder what they're going to call beer.

1997
02:11:54,526 --> 02:11:55,487
[SPEAKER_03]: They call wine nectar.

1998
02:11:57,349 --> 02:11:58,290
[SPEAKER_03]: It should just be wine.

1999
02:11:58,990 --> 02:11:59,751
[SPEAKER_03]: And they should have beer.

2000
02:12:00,011 --> 02:12:01,813
[SPEAKER_03]: And they need to have hard booze.

2001
02:12:02,253 --> 02:12:05,797
[SPEAKER_03]: You should build a moonshine still in your bathroom.

2002
02:12:06,057 --> 02:12:09,100
[SPEAKER_03]: Like in Dukes of Hazzard.

2003
02:12:09,851 --> 02:12:15,113
[SPEAKER_10]: Sims 2 has so much fan-made content from the 14 whatever expansion packs that came out.

2004
02:12:15,153 --> 02:12:16,474
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure you can do that stuff in Sims 2.

2005
02:12:16,954 --> 02:12:19,415
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Sims 3 has a lot of that stuff too.

2006
02:12:19,975 --> 02:12:20,135
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

2007
02:12:20,336 --> 02:12:24,677
[SPEAKER_03]: And people making game mods and everything and EA knows.

2008
02:12:25,218 --> 02:12:25,418
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

2009
02:12:25,898 --> 02:12:28,319
[SPEAKER_03]: There's like, okay, well you get to reinstall all of your stuff again.

2010
02:12:30,686 --> 02:12:35,770
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, okay, Red Entertainment also asks, I'm thinking of building a general media library in my house once I buy one.

2011
02:12:36,210 --> 02:12:38,732
[SPEAKER_03]: How large is the room your vault is in?

2012
02:12:39,592 --> 02:12:40,633
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a small bedroom.

2013
02:12:40,973 --> 02:12:45,636
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like 7x7 or something in there.

2014
02:12:45,656 --> 02:12:49,259
[SPEAKER_03]: Something like that, yeah.

2015
02:12:49,719 --> 02:12:54,302
[SPEAKER_03]: It's big enough for a bed and a dresser and, you know, bedside table.

2016
02:12:54,813 --> 02:13:02,537
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd probably put like a... I think a queen-size bed would fit in there, but... We used to have the futon in there, and it took up most of the room.

2017
02:13:02,837 --> 02:13:03,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

2018
02:13:03,958 --> 02:13:04,238
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

2019
02:13:05,258 --> 02:13:08,440
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, not a whole lot of... But there's lots of shelves.

2020
02:13:08,520 --> 02:13:10,181
[SPEAKER_10]: Things are up to the ceiling.

2021
02:13:10,641 --> 02:13:26,328
[SPEAKER_03]: We put in a really big two shelf unit that our friend gave us that has a lot of space on it and then we have utility shelves in the closet and a number of bookshelves up on the walls too.

2022
02:13:27,348 --> 02:13:35,892
[SPEAKER_03]: We've maximized our space saving options and I totally recommend investing in bins with lids that you can see through.

2023
02:13:40,120 --> 02:13:41,681
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, no one's sending us any more questions.

2024
02:13:44,802 --> 02:13:45,483
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that a Rob?

2025
02:13:46,543 --> 02:13:47,184
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a Rob.

2026
02:13:47,564 --> 02:13:49,785
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, the first thing he says when he comes in is bastard.

2027
02:13:51,066 --> 02:13:51,946
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is just like Rob.

2028
02:13:53,207 --> 02:13:54,408
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome back, Rob!

2029
02:13:56,188 --> 02:13:57,049
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm coming to cook!

2030
02:13:57,409 --> 02:13:58,950
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I don't want Rob to burn my house down.

2031
02:14:01,211 --> 02:14:01,971
[SPEAKER_10]: He never cooks.

2032
02:14:02,612 --> 02:14:02,792
[SPEAKER_10]: Ever.

2033
02:14:03,454 --> 02:14:04,395
[SPEAKER_03]: He made toast once.

2034
02:14:05,596 --> 02:14:11,721
[SPEAKER_03]: I went to... When he and Loki had the place, I went and made lobster kebabs for Rob.

2035
02:14:12,742 --> 02:14:13,242
[SPEAKER_08]: Good times.

2036
02:14:13,582 --> 02:14:13,903
[SPEAKER_03]: They were.

2037
02:14:14,723 --> 02:14:14,943
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

2038
02:14:15,264 --> 02:14:15,784
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna go cook.

2039
02:14:16,345 --> 02:14:16,665
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

2040
02:14:17,385 --> 02:14:18,326
[SPEAKER_08]: Are we playing chair roulette?

2041
02:14:18,346 --> 02:14:18,907
[SPEAKER_08]: Where am I sitting?

2042
02:14:18,987 --> 02:14:20,208
[SPEAKER_08]: You should go sit in Jeremy's chair.

2043
02:14:20,348 --> 02:14:20,508
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

2044
02:14:21,738 --> 02:14:23,019
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, I'm back everybody.

2045
02:14:23,339 --> 02:14:23,960
[SPEAKER_08]: I had a good trip.

2046
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:25,161
[SPEAKER_08]: Did I miss any good questions?

2047
02:14:25,321 --> 02:14:27,102
[SPEAKER_08]: What were questions that were asked?

2048
02:14:27,303 --> 02:14:31,426
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, like, what was the first game you played?

2049
02:14:33,447 --> 02:14:34,588
[SPEAKER_08]: I just thought they timed me.

2050
02:14:34,668 --> 02:14:37,951
[SPEAKER_08]: Goldanthro says it took Rob about 19 minutes and 43 seconds.

2051
02:14:38,051 --> 02:14:38,472
[SPEAKER_08]: There it is.

2052
02:14:39,012 --> 02:14:39,532
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what's funny?

2053
02:14:39,572 --> 02:14:40,853
[SPEAKER_08]: I couldn't find the place either.

2054
02:14:40,934 --> 02:14:43,395
[SPEAKER_08]: I had to drive, because I knew it was at...

2055
02:14:44,216 --> 02:15:06,786
[SPEAKER_08]: such and such street in I-80 and I was like okay well there's a lot of shops around there so I was kind of like looking around I'm like do I go I know of this and yeah I had to drive around a little bit so I would have gotten back in like 14 minutes if I hadn't you know gotten lost that's all right okay sorry the game yes the questions I missed good stuff any good ones

2056
02:15:09,644 --> 02:15:17,351
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, yeah, first game played, and then I think I asked them what the first real RPG that you played from start to finish was.

2057
02:15:17,771 --> 02:15:19,252
[SPEAKER_10]: The first game played?

2058
02:15:19,752 --> 02:15:22,595
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, like, I think ours was like Pac-Man, Combat Outlaws.

2059
02:15:22,875 --> 02:15:25,557
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, oh, like the first game I remember playing.

2060
02:15:26,078 --> 02:15:26,278
[SPEAKER_08]: Um...

2061
02:15:28,903 --> 02:15:35,467
[SPEAKER_08]: I have memories of playing Spider-Man on the 2600, but I don't think that was the very first game I ever played.

2062
02:15:35,547 --> 02:15:43,713
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably Pac-Man on the 2600, that really awful, like, bong, bong, bong, boo-doo-doo-doo, like the old school noises in it.

2063
02:15:43,893 --> 02:15:47,555
[SPEAKER_08]: When you hit a ghost, I can't get my voice to go that high, but the...

2064
02:15:49,176 --> 02:15:51,057
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it was pretty bad.

2065
02:15:51,157 --> 02:15:52,879
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you read the drama about why that happened?

2066
02:15:53,059 --> 02:15:59,083
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, when you read about the whole drama behind it, it actually makes a lot of sense why that game turned out the way it is.

2067
02:15:59,343 --> 02:16:02,025
[SPEAKER_08]: They would not let him produce it on the cartridge he needed.

2068
02:16:02,945 --> 02:16:03,526
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's why Ms.

2069
02:16:03,546 --> 02:16:04,566
[SPEAKER_08]: Pac-Man was so much better.

2070
02:16:05,007 --> 02:16:18,035
[SPEAKER_10]: Everything about the epic video game industry bust of 84 and all of the shovelware they were putting out, Pac-Man was related to that because Pac-Man was a national phenomenon and they finally got the home version.

2071
02:16:18,075 --> 02:16:19,036
[SPEAKER_10]: It was the ugliest thing.

2072
02:16:19,216 --> 02:16:21,057
[SPEAKER_10]: It was ugly as fuck, it really was.

2073
02:16:21,077 --> 02:16:22,317
[SPEAKER_10]: Did that game even have fruit in it?

2074
02:16:22,337 --> 02:16:24,357
[SPEAKER_08]: It had the wafer in the middle.

2075
02:16:45,183 --> 02:16:45,663
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2076
02:17:14,938 --> 02:17:15,518
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2077
02:17:36,924 --> 02:17:41,126
[SPEAKER_08]: And he still defends that it was not as terrible of a game as everybody says it is.

2078
02:17:41,166 --> 02:17:42,026
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't think it was.

2079
02:17:42,807 --> 02:17:48,189
[SPEAKER_08]: It just had a couple key design problems with it that really prevented it from being... Yeah, it's hard to understand.

2080
02:17:49,510 --> 02:17:51,050
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was playable.

2081
02:17:51,070 --> 02:17:55,032
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably hard for some people to figure out what you had to do.

2082
02:17:55,272 --> 02:17:57,953
[SPEAKER_02]: It took me a while to figure out what you had to do to finish it.

2083
02:17:58,093 --> 02:17:58,713
[SPEAKER_08]: It really does.

2084
02:17:58,773 --> 02:17:59,974
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not an easy game to figure out.

2085
02:18:00,034 --> 02:18:04,756
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it wasn't intuitive at all, but I remember beating it and getting him onto the ship.

2086
02:18:05,077 --> 02:18:07,418
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I think every time you do it, doesn't it get harder and harder?

2087
02:18:08,178 --> 02:18:08,678
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't remember.

2088
02:18:08,899 --> 02:18:09,139
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

2089
02:18:09,519 --> 02:18:10,399
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it probably does.

2090
02:18:10,439 --> 02:18:13,201
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, when you're seven, it's hard to have really discerning taste.

2091
02:18:13,261 --> 02:18:15,302
[SPEAKER_08]: That's usually the way the Atari 2600 games work.

2092
02:18:15,342 --> 02:18:17,003
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just the same thing over, but it gets harder.

2093
02:18:18,944 --> 02:18:20,565
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, and then the other one was about RPGs.

2094
02:18:20,745 --> 02:18:22,907
[SPEAKER_08]: No, you asked a question about RPGs.

2095
02:18:23,067 --> 02:18:33,435
[SPEAKER_10]: That was the question that I added was not including Zelda, because I think everyone our age has played Zelda and that's more adventure, but just RPG, Earthbound, StarTropics, whatever.

2096
02:18:33,475 --> 02:18:36,617
[SPEAKER_10]: What was the first one you invested in and finished where you saw the ending?

2097
02:18:36,737 --> 02:18:38,718
[SPEAKER_10]: That I actually finished or that I played?

2098
02:18:39,459 --> 02:18:40,259
[SPEAKER_10]: That you finished.

2099
02:18:40,640 --> 02:18:41,280
[SPEAKER_08]: Adventure on the 2600?

2100
02:18:42,677 --> 02:18:45,399
[SPEAKER_08]: I never beat Final Fantasy Does it have liquor in it?

2101
02:18:45,419 --> 02:18:47,320
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll try it They can't hear you It's brandy and apple juice

2102
02:19:14,371 --> 02:19:15,732
[SPEAKER_08]: That is pretty fucking good.

2103
02:19:16,752 --> 02:19:17,613
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I thought this was for me.

2104
02:19:19,634 --> 02:19:20,175
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, poor Jamie.

2105
02:19:20,475 --> 02:19:21,115
[SPEAKER_08]: Come on, Jamie.

2106
02:19:23,417 --> 02:19:27,840
[SPEAKER_08]: The look on her face... I'm sorry, the look on her face was of such defeat.

2107
02:19:27,920 --> 02:19:32,283
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, this cross between, oh, you bitch, and, oh, you bitch!

2108
02:19:36,994 --> 02:19:38,715
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll try what that is, the apple pie thing.

2109
02:19:38,735 --> 02:19:39,435
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to try a sip of this?

2110
02:19:39,535 --> 02:19:40,036
[SPEAKER_08]: See if you like it?

2111
02:19:40,276 --> 02:19:42,157
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'll like it, I'm sure.

2112
02:19:42,477 --> 02:19:43,277
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

2113
02:19:46,439 --> 02:19:47,360
[SPEAKER_08]: What question were we on?

2114
02:19:47,860 --> 02:19:48,200
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

2115
02:19:48,240 --> 02:19:49,541
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, Rama, I'm sorry.

2116
02:19:49,601 --> 02:19:51,402
[SPEAKER_08]: It just won my heart in there.

2117
02:19:51,502 --> 02:19:55,204
[SPEAKER_08]: Not like actually, but it's the first NES game I played was The Goonies 2.

2118
02:19:56,244 --> 02:20:00,927
[SPEAKER_08]: That game was so underrated for its time because it was so hard.

2119
02:20:01,147 --> 02:20:03,008
[SPEAKER_08]: It was so complicated, but that game is amazing.

2120
02:20:03,568 --> 02:20:21,495
[SPEAKER_10]: I beat that game with the help of the Nintendo tip line where it was like what five bucks a call and what 86 87 and I had to basically cry to my grandmother please let me call you've called that number like four times this month all for the same game and I was like please like

2121
02:20:22,415 --> 02:20:30,360
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't have to give me a Christmas present if you let me call the Nest line because that was the shit back then.

2122
02:20:30,640 --> 02:20:31,421
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd never call it.

2123
02:20:31,461 --> 02:20:34,863
[SPEAKER_08]: My mom was like, no, no, no, go to your room.

2124
02:20:35,123 --> 02:20:35,363
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

2125
02:20:36,584 --> 02:20:37,885
[SPEAKER_08]: She wouldn't budge at all.

2126
02:20:37,965 --> 02:20:43,948
[SPEAKER_08]: I could be like, I have an uncurable disease and the only people that could cure it is Nintendo Live.

2127
02:20:44,328 --> 02:20:47,130
[SPEAKER_10]: I have to enter the Konami code to cure cancer and I don't know what it is.

2128
02:20:47,410 --> 02:20:49,111
[SPEAKER_08]: She's like, do they charge?

2129
02:20:49,311 --> 02:20:49,591
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

2130
02:20:49,952 --> 02:20:50,452
[SPEAKER_08]: Go to your room.

2131
02:20:52,651 --> 02:20:55,432
[SPEAKER_08]: So that would be her response, essentially.

2132
02:20:57,092 --> 02:21:00,294
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, Alan's trying to... We're getting boozed up right now.

2133
02:21:00,334 --> 02:21:00,814
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really awesome.

2134
02:21:00,834 --> 02:21:03,395
[SPEAKER_08]: Which isn't smart, because I have to drive home in four hours.

2135
02:21:03,675 --> 02:21:05,875
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I could sleep here, but... Well, who knows?

2136
02:21:05,895 --> 02:21:06,536
[SPEAKER_03]: We might go long.

2137
02:21:06,716 --> 02:21:07,336
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got energy.

2138
02:21:07,776 --> 02:21:08,456
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, we'll see.

2139
02:21:08,496 --> 02:21:08,796
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see.

2140
02:21:09,216 --> 02:21:12,718
[SPEAKER_03]: But I was actually sort of thinking that maybe it could have used another shot of Brandy.

2141
02:21:13,178 --> 02:21:13,518
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

2142
02:21:13,598 --> 02:21:14,838
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to get too screwed up.

2143
02:21:15,899 --> 02:21:16,959
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Alan gets more and you don't.

2144
02:21:20,240 --> 02:21:20,821
[SPEAKER_08]: Where were we?

2145
02:21:20,941 --> 02:21:24,365
[SPEAKER_08]: Goonies 2, Nintendo Tip Line, It Was The Shit, etc.

2146
02:21:25,305 --> 02:21:25,686
[SPEAKER_08]: Then what?

2147
02:21:26,667 --> 02:21:28,669
[SPEAKER_02]: What was the first game you played in roller skates?

2148
02:21:29,149 --> 02:21:31,832
[SPEAKER_08]: The first game I played in... Oh, I never answered the RPG one.

2149
02:21:32,693 --> 02:21:38,679
[SPEAKER_08]: The RPG... That's not Zelda.

2150
02:21:38,699 --> 02:21:38,799
[SPEAKER_08]: Zelda.

2151
02:21:39,813 --> 02:21:40,714
[SPEAKER_08]: Dragon Warrior Dragon Warrior

2152
02:21:57,810 --> 02:21:58,931
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2153
02:22:17,068 --> 02:22:18,028
[SPEAKER_08]: Dragon Warrior Final Fantasy 1

2154
02:22:45,748 --> 02:22:47,510
[SPEAKER_10]: EarthBound was actually Mother 2 in Japan Mother 1 was on the NES

2155
02:23:08,436 --> 02:23:14,199
[SPEAKER_08]: But, um, yeah, Mother 2 was on the Super Nintendo, then Mother 3 didn't come out until, like, just recently, right?

2156
02:23:14,960 --> 02:23:16,040
[SPEAKER_08]: So, alright.

2157
02:23:16,561 --> 02:23:17,761
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we need to play chair roulette again?

2158
02:23:18,402 --> 02:23:18,782
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

2159
02:23:19,342 --> 02:23:19,462
[SPEAKER_08]: No?

2160
02:23:19,642 --> 02:23:20,123
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, you're baking.

2161
02:23:20,163 --> 02:23:20,623
[SPEAKER_08]: You're baking.

2162
02:23:20,663 --> 02:23:21,403
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right, DarkSakura.

2163
02:23:21,483 --> 02:23:22,384
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'm gonna get baked.

2164
02:23:23,564 --> 02:23:24,165
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop.

2165
02:23:24,525 --> 02:23:29,628
[SPEAKER_03]: No, um, yeah, I figured I may as well stay up, because it's got five more minutes left on it, and I'll just harass Dan.

2166
02:23:29,708 --> 02:23:30,108
[SPEAKER_03]: Good times.

2167
02:23:30,828 --> 02:23:31,649
[SPEAKER_08]: What pizza did you make first?

2168
02:23:32,313 --> 02:23:32,893
[SPEAKER_03]: The pepperoni.

2169
02:23:33,253 --> 02:23:34,234
[SPEAKER_03]: Dang, bless your heart.

2170
02:23:34,314 --> 02:23:37,135
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I figured most of y'all are going to eat the pepperoni.

2171
02:23:37,355 --> 02:23:39,155
[SPEAKER_03]: I can cook my chicken one next.

2172
02:23:39,315 --> 02:23:40,896
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the veggie.

2173
02:23:41,116 --> 02:23:44,197
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll have a piece of the chicken one, I guess, if the pepperoni goes real fast.

2174
02:23:45,097 --> 02:23:48,358
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, and then you started to ask, what was the first game I played in roller skates?

2175
02:23:49,379 --> 02:23:51,459
[SPEAKER_08]: The local roller rink near us had Spy Hunter.

2176
02:23:51,819 --> 02:23:53,040
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was a stand-up cabinet.

2177
02:23:53,440 --> 02:23:55,500
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was the kind where you actually had the drive pedal.

2178
02:23:55,821 --> 02:23:57,701
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I would use the roller skates and the drive pedal.

2179
02:23:58,261 --> 02:24:00,142
[SPEAKER_08]: I would say it was probably that or air hockey.

2180
02:24:01,107 --> 02:24:02,248
[SPEAKER_08]: Good old Roller King.

2181
02:24:02,309 --> 02:24:03,730
[SPEAKER_08]: It's still there out in Roseville.

2182
02:24:03,790 --> 02:24:05,232
[SPEAKER_08]: It's right by where I grew up.

2183
02:24:06,714 --> 02:24:07,915
[SPEAKER_08]: Gitan says his first was Gauntlet.

2184
02:24:07,936 --> 02:24:08,837
[SPEAKER_08]: When's Dan going to be on the show?

2185
02:24:08,977 --> 02:24:10,258
[SPEAKER_08]: Is Dan going to come be on OLR?

2186
02:24:12,864 --> 02:24:16,805
[SPEAKER_08]: The game that should not be named Alright Is that it for Ask Orange Launch?

2187
02:24:17,965 --> 02:24:38,711
[SPEAKER_08]: Someone asked if we could play Name That Tune And then I think Jamie was like Dark Destiny has been begging me for that all week I didn't really set it up in advance I'm sorry And I don't even remember how the rules to that go I mean I could see Yeah, we want to do match game and list list But I have to set those up too So we'll play with that later

2188
02:24:39,127 --> 02:24:46,949
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, how about when I change out the pizzas, we can do the rest of the questions that are on our list for discussion topics.

2189
02:24:47,289 --> 02:24:47,469
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

2190
02:24:47,630 --> 02:24:52,631
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, actually, I'll tell you what, since really the rest of it was on there for you and Alan.

2191
02:24:55,952 --> 02:24:59,113
[SPEAKER_01]: How about you guys go ahead and do your thing?

2192
02:25:00,433 --> 02:25:00,853
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah.

2193
02:25:00,913 --> 02:25:01,534
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's get in there.

2194
02:25:01,554 --> 02:25:02,954
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, there were a couple news stories, too.

2195
02:25:03,014 --> 02:25:03,774
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we want to cover those?

2196
02:25:03,794 --> 02:25:05,115
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

2197
02:25:06,624 --> 02:25:08,625
[SPEAKER_08]: There was one about Telltale.

2198
02:25:08,985 --> 02:25:11,506
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't we just do those after I'm done with pizza?

2199
02:25:11,526 --> 02:25:12,007
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, that's fine.

2200
02:25:12,407 --> 02:25:13,427
[SPEAKER_03]: Not like we don't have all night, Rob.

2201
02:25:14,348 --> 02:25:17,689
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, Alan and I wanted to do our own classic games of the week.

2202
02:25:17,709 --> 02:25:20,370
[SPEAKER_08]: And I want to let Bradley do one of these too, but I didn't know he was going to be here tonight.

2203
02:25:20,410 --> 02:25:23,212
[SPEAKER_08]: So Alan and I are doing our own classic games of the week.

2204
02:25:23,232 --> 02:25:27,494
[SPEAKER_08]: We're taking over this segment because, you know, we wanted to have a longer show tonight.

2205
02:25:27,734 --> 02:25:30,815
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're kind of jealous that DarkSakura always gets this segment.

2206
02:25:30,835 --> 02:25:31,896
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, don't you get jealous of her?

2207
02:25:33,036 --> 02:25:34,257
[SPEAKER_08]: Alan, don't you want to be just like her?

2208
02:25:39,753 --> 02:25:42,397
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have our own little Classic Game of the Week segment.

2209
02:25:46,363 --> 02:25:48,566
[SPEAKER_08]: Breakman's asking, when are they going to play Truth or Dare?

2210
02:25:48,787 --> 02:25:50,028
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to have to get me drunk or not.

2211
02:25:50,129 --> 02:25:50,489
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2212
02:25:52,212 --> 02:25:53,393
[SPEAKER_08]: Our own Classic Games of the Week.

2213
02:25:55,373 --> 02:25:56,414
[SPEAKER_08]: Alan, you want to start first?

2214
02:25:56,654 --> 02:25:58,175
[SPEAKER_08]: What did you pick as your classic game of the week?

2215
02:25:58,475 --> 02:26:03,078
[SPEAKER_10]: I would love to take a minute to re-familiarize myself with the Wikipedia article on it.

2216
02:26:03,098 --> 02:26:03,538
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, that's fine.

2217
02:26:03,558 --> 02:26:03,778
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll do it.

2218
02:26:03,798 --> 02:26:04,479
[SPEAKER_08]: So can you go first?

2219
02:26:04,539 --> 02:26:05,059
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I can.

2220
02:26:06,020 --> 02:26:07,881
[SPEAKER_08]: Because you asked so kindly, I will go first.

2221
02:26:07,921 --> 02:26:11,864
[SPEAKER_08]: And my classic game of the week... Okay, the music to this sucks, but deal.

2222
02:26:12,284 --> 02:26:16,507
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I have picked a game that was on the PC a while ago.

2223
02:26:16,547 --> 02:26:21,210
[SPEAKER_08]: And you're going to hear this awesome ad-lib noise in the background because it used the ad-lib card to make noise.

2224
02:26:22,070 --> 02:26:24,592
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a game called Lexi Cross.

2225
02:26:24,612 --> 02:26:24,692
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

2226
02:26:26,393 --> 02:26:28,033
[SPEAKER_08]: Lexi Cross was like, there's like no music.

2227
02:26:28,114 --> 02:26:29,494
[SPEAKER_08]: It just has the ambient noise to it.

2228
02:26:29,894 --> 02:26:33,756
[SPEAKER_08]: Lexi Cross was like a futuristic game show that was on the PC.

2229
02:26:33,776 --> 02:26:35,337
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me actually fast forward as an actual gameplay.

2230
02:26:35,357 --> 02:26:41,660
[SPEAKER_08]: You're just going to hear that noise like a million times because that was most of the music in the game.

2231
02:26:42,080 --> 02:27:09,394
[SPEAKER_08]: but basically what would happen is it was a two player futuristic game show and on each side of the board you would have all these monitors or tiles that you would have your little robot Vanna White that you moved around the screen and she could reveal the tiles but if you hit a blank square your turn would be over but if you hit a silver square that was part of the crossword puzzle then you could keep going so it was like this entire crossword puzzle was hidden underneath

2232
02:27:11,641 --> 02:27:12,461
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2233
02:27:33,806 --> 02:27:36,787
[SPEAKER_08]: And at the end of the day, you could spin the wheel was another option.

2234
02:27:36,827 --> 02:27:41,589
[SPEAKER_08]: When you feel you've revealed enough tiles on the board, you could spin the wheel for money and it kind of worked like Wheel of Fortune.

2235
02:27:42,269 --> 02:27:48,511
[SPEAKER_08]: And once you revealed all the letters on the board, they would all kind of add up to what the answer was.

2236
02:27:48,611 --> 02:27:56,694
[SPEAKER_08]: Like all the words in the crossword had something to do with the, like if I fast forward way ahead in this video here, where they actually start spinning for letters if they ever do.

2237
02:27:59,056 --> 02:28:02,478
[SPEAKER_08]: I think this guy probably runs out of time at some point, but he's spinning the wheel here.

2238
02:28:03,639 --> 02:28:08,823
[SPEAKER_08]: At some point, so many letters will be revealed that they'll all have something in common.

2239
02:28:08,863 --> 02:28:18,410
[SPEAKER_08]: Like maybe they're all places in Hawaii, or they're all quotes from Shakespeare or something, characters.

2240
02:28:18,790 --> 02:28:20,651
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's kind of what you have to figure out there.

2241
02:28:20,751 --> 02:28:23,733
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's a cool little old school game show.

2242
02:28:24,694 --> 02:28:46,877
[SPEAKER_08]: and is um I don't know if you can even download that like on good old games or anything like that like I doubt it's available anywhere like that but um it's still out there on probably abandonware sites and good stuff like that but there was copy protection in the manual it actually came with a little tv guide parody that actually was the copy protection you had to know like what was on page seven you remember old school copy protection on pc games like

2243
02:28:47,518 --> 02:28:56,149
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I remember playing Leisure Suit Larry at my friend's house and also King's Quest, having to dig through the manual to find the right word.

2244
02:28:56,889 --> 02:28:57,851
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, you know what it was?

2245
02:28:57,891 --> 02:29:01,435
[SPEAKER_08]: The copy protection was like, what is on channel such and such at 7 o'clock?

2246
02:29:01,495 --> 02:29:03,237
[SPEAKER_08]: Because that's what was in the TV guide.

2247
02:29:03,257 --> 02:29:05,320
[SPEAKER_08]: It was like a programming list.

2248
02:29:06,781 --> 02:29:08,623
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm reading the Wikipedia article on this.

2249
02:29:08,683 --> 02:29:10,045
[SPEAKER_08]: It came out in 1991.

2250
02:29:10,085 --> 02:29:11,286
[SPEAKER_08]: It was by Interplay.

2251
02:29:11,927 --> 02:29:16,893
[SPEAKER_08]: Interplay made some other awesome old school PC games in the early 90s and stuff.

2252
02:29:16,913 --> 02:29:18,134
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they finally shut down in 2000.

2253
02:29:18,535 --> 02:29:19,155
[SPEAKER_08]: What did they make?

2254
02:29:19,215 --> 02:29:19,556
[SPEAKER_08]: They made...

2255
02:29:21,077 --> 02:29:22,078
[SPEAKER_08]: Did they make MDK?

2256
02:29:23,139 --> 02:29:23,799
[SPEAKER_08]: They made that.

2257
02:29:23,860 --> 02:29:26,281
[SPEAKER_08]: They made Bard's Tale.

2258
02:29:26,722 --> 02:29:27,863
[SPEAKER_08]: They're the guys that made Bard's Tale.

2259
02:29:28,503 --> 02:29:29,064
[SPEAKER_08]: Good times.

2260
02:29:29,824 --> 02:29:31,526
[SPEAKER_08]: Descent was also them.

2261
02:29:31,686 --> 02:29:32,807
[SPEAKER_08]: So they had a lot of good stuff.

2262
02:29:33,187 --> 02:29:36,710
[SPEAKER_08]: And they say it's a combination of Wheel of Fortune, Scrabble, and Battleship.

2263
02:29:36,750 --> 02:29:39,552
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's a pretty good combination.

2264
02:29:39,932 --> 02:29:44,216
[SPEAKER_08]: The words eventually comprise a theme or a quotation which the player must guess to win the game.

2265
02:29:44,756 --> 02:29:51,694
[SPEAKER_08]: so that's it, a game show, go figure I picked a game show as my little classic game of the week but Lexi Cross, definitely an underlooked classic

2266
02:29:52,301 --> 02:29:53,181
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, Alan, you all ready?

2267
02:29:53,562 --> 02:29:53,862
[SPEAKER_08]: I am.

2268
02:29:54,242 --> 02:29:54,602
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2269
02:29:54,902 --> 02:29:55,703
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, Clay Fighter.

2270
02:29:55,763 --> 02:29:57,043
[SPEAKER_08]: Dark Tetsuya reminds us in chat.

2271
02:29:57,084 --> 02:29:58,204
[SPEAKER_08]: Interplay did make Clay Fighter.

2272
02:29:58,484 --> 02:29:59,665
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's play the music one more time.

2273
02:30:00,305 --> 02:30:02,486
[SPEAKER_08]: I like this so much, I want to do the classic game all over again.

2274
02:30:03,147 --> 02:30:04,647
[SPEAKER_08]: Alan, what is your classic game of the week?

2275
02:30:05,028 --> 02:30:18,355
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, for those of us who grew up playing Sierra online games, whether it be Space Quest, King's Quest, or Police Quest, often came across one of their lesser talked about series, the Quest for Glory.

2276
02:30:19,355 --> 02:30:23,237
[SPEAKER_10]: franchise and my pick is Quest for Glory 2 Trial by Fire.

2277
02:30:24,858 --> 02:30:26,939
[SPEAKER_10]: Came out in November of 1990.

2278
02:30:28,260 --> 02:30:30,501
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, this guy's talking through his thing here.

2279
02:30:30,521 --> 02:30:33,263
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, I gotta try to find some gameplay of this.

2280
02:30:34,403 --> 02:30:36,305
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if there's anything where the guy's not talking.

2281
02:30:37,625 --> 02:30:39,626
[SPEAKER_10]: You found the one earlier that had the opening.

2282
02:30:39,646 --> 02:30:40,487
[SPEAKER_08]: No, he was talking.

2283
02:30:40,507 --> 02:30:43,489
[SPEAKER_08]: We didn't listen to the... Let me see.

2284
02:30:44,949 --> 02:30:47,852
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, let's look at the introduction.

2285
02:30:48,092 --> 02:30:49,593
[SPEAKER_08]: See, we didn't hear this earlier, did we?

2286
02:30:49,933 --> 02:30:50,514
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think so.

2287
02:30:50,534 --> 02:30:54,618
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't want to hear this jerk talk over the game.

2288
02:30:54,638 --> 02:31:11,753
[SPEAKER_10]: So, Quest for Glory 1 had a traditional medieval English theme to it, and at the end of the game, after the closing credits, your friend comes by on a flying carpet, and it's sort of a cliffhanger ending, and he swoops the hero up on his flying carpet, and they fly away.

2289
02:31:12,473 --> 02:31:22,019
[SPEAKER_10]: And when they land in Quest for Glory 2, they are in Shapir, which is sort of a Persian, you know, 1001 Arabian Nights styled game.

2290
02:31:23,099 --> 02:31:25,601
[SPEAKER_10]: It is out of King's Quest and Space Quest.

2291
02:31:25,661 --> 02:31:28,482
[SPEAKER_10]: It's more traditionally an RPG.

2292
02:31:28,983 --> 02:31:34,406
[SPEAKER_10]: Those games are mostly about their puzzle solving and the narrative.

2293
02:31:34,526 --> 02:31:36,647
[SPEAKER_10]: But Quest for Glory actually had classes.

2294
02:31:37,147 --> 02:31:39,489
[SPEAKER_10]: You could be a thief, mage, or warrior.

2295
02:31:40,149 --> 02:31:41,470
[SPEAKER_08]: I did play this game.

2296
02:31:41,550 --> 02:31:42,991
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god, it was good.

2297
02:31:43,711 --> 02:31:45,252
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god, this game was awesome.

2298
02:31:45,272 --> 02:31:47,253
[SPEAKER_08]: It didn't trigger until you said that.

2299
02:31:47,293 --> 02:31:47,974
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, I remember.

2300
02:31:48,154 --> 02:31:49,235
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you could be the different classes.

2301
02:31:49,675 --> 02:31:59,101
[SPEAKER_10]: And you could import your save file from part one so you could keep the same character name and stats that you had at the end of the first one, which was a big deal at the time.

2302
02:32:00,421 --> 02:32:09,388
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a puzzle towards the end of the game where you had to knock over these candles because if the candles got lit, this evil ritual would complete.

2303
02:32:10,048 --> 02:32:15,352
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you were a mage, you'd cast a magic missile, or if you were a thief, you would throw your knives.

2304
02:32:15,992 --> 02:32:19,514
[SPEAKER_10]: So whatever class you were sort of affected how you solved the puzzles.

2305
02:32:20,775 --> 02:32:25,659
[SPEAKER_10]: It's about an evil vizier who wanted to raise a genie, the genie Iblis.

2306
02:32:26,699 --> 02:32:27,180
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

2307
02:32:29,421 --> 02:32:50,304
[SPEAKER_10]: and the game took place over the course of 30 days in game time so if you couldn't figure out how to pop how to solve a puzzle for a certain day and your character was tired you would go to the inn and type sleep and go to sleep you'd wake up and then you you had to go out on a fresh clock it'd be 7 a.m and you'd go out and you'd try to solve the puzzles again

2308
02:32:51,906 --> 02:33:08,788
[SPEAKER_10]: and you had to wrap up the game within 30 days of game time and the big deal about this game is that if you were super polite and you did all of the optional side quests at the end once you beat the game you would discover that you would unlock the paladin career path

2309
02:33:10,604 --> 02:33:28,935
[SPEAKER_10]: and when you saved your game file and loaded it into quest for glory 3 you would be a paladin and that you could unlock that depending on it didn't matter if you were a thief or really important interruption you'll eat veggie right yes okay they're all getting their pizza while i talk about this game um

2310
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:41,242
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, Quest for Glory came along pretty late in the EGA text-based adventure game era of Sierra.

2311
02:33:41,782 --> 02:33:48,984
[SPEAKER_10]: Only the first two had EGA graphics and were completely text-driven, as far as entering the commands.

2312
02:33:49,484 --> 02:33:53,325
[SPEAKER_10]: Quest for Glory 3, which had a more African...

2313
02:33:54,225 --> 02:34:05,389
[SPEAKER_10]: slash Mayan setting to it was had by then adapted to VGA graphics and the mouse cursor where you click on look or touch and then that's how you interacted with the puzzles.

2314
02:34:07,139 --> 02:34:12,881
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, I played this game all through 8th grade and freshman year of high school.

2315
02:34:13,761 --> 02:34:14,901
[SPEAKER_10]: And it is super awesome.

2316
02:34:16,081 --> 02:34:24,344
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's one of the few franchises that people often overlook when talking about the glory of Sierra Online's reign.

2317
02:34:24,364 --> 02:34:29,325
[SPEAKER_08]: That's true, because most people remember Leisure Suit Larry and King's Quest, especially the fourth one.

2318
02:34:29,785 --> 02:34:31,206
[SPEAKER_08]: But usually this one gets overlooked.

2319
02:34:31,286 --> 02:34:32,166
[SPEAKER_08]: That and Space Quest.

2320
02:34:32,546 --> 02:34:32,686
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

2321
02:34:33,857 --> 02:35:02,306
[SPEAKER_10]: so yeah the fact that you could start with Quest for Glory 1 and use the same save file the same character sheet all through Quest for Glory 5 which I owned but I never played because it was very Quest for Glory 5 came out in I think the mid 90s late 90s when adventure games were dead no one cared no one was doing them anymore so it was very buggy and broken and I never really finished it but this one out of the original classics part 2 is definitely the best

2322
02:35:04,274 --> 02:35:06,356
[SPEAKER_08]: What was it about 2 that made you love it the most?

2323
02:35:07,397 --> 02:35:09,319
[SPEAKER_10]: Just the music, the atmosphere.

2324
02:35:11,441 --> 02:35:15,485
[SPEAKER_10]: It basically took everything that was in 1 and just made it better, like a sequel should.

2325
02:35:16,710 --> 02:35:18,311
[SPEAKER_08]: Derek H and Chad asked a good question.

2326
02:35:18,351 --> 02:35:19,672
[SPEAKER_08]: What happened to Roberta Williams?

2327
02:35:20,373 --> 02:35:22,214
[SPEAKER_08]: Didn't she kind of... I don't know.

2328
02:35:22,254 --> 02:35:25,216
[SPEAKER_08]: She wasn't happy with the way the gaming culture was going, right?

2329
02:35:25,256 --> 02:35:27,377
[SPEAKER_08]: She wasn't a fan of consoles, if I'm not mistaken.

2330
02:35:28,118 --> 02:35:37,524
[SPEAKER_10]: The last thing that she really consulted on, I want to say, was Quest for Glory 8, which had this guy in it that wasn't from the...

2331
02:35:39,426 --> 02:35:41,027
[SPEAKER_10]: and Daventry and all that.

2332
02:35:41,087 --> 02:35:46,832
[SPEAKER_10]: It was very ugly, clunky 3D adventure game with real-time combat.

2333
02:35:46,852 --> 02:35:47,533
[SPEAKER_10]: It was awful.

2334
02:35:48,294 --> 02:35:49,655
[SPEAKER_10]: King's Quest Mask of Eternity.

2335
02:35:50,215 --> 02:35:52,277
[SPEAKER_10]: That was the last thing that she sort of consulted on.

2336
02:35:52,938 --> 02:35:59,304
[SPEAKER_10]: But after that, I think Sierra went bankrupt because adventure gaming was over.

2337
02:35:59,544 --> 02:35:59,744
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

2338
02:36:00,985 --> 02:36:03,226
[SPEAKER_08]: Real quick, I'm looking at a Wikipedia article on her.

2339
02:36:03,286 --> 02:36:04,606
[SPEAKER_08]: She also made Phantasmagoria.

2340
02:36:04,786 --> 02:36:06,506
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember, it was also towards the end of her run.

2341
02:36:07,007 --> 02:36:09,587
[SPEAKER_10]: Across seven discs when it came out.

2342
02:36:09,687 --> 02:36:10,007
[SPEAKER_08]: Epic.

2343
02:36:10,587 --> 02:36:14,368
[SPEAKER_08]: She retired in 1998, and she's kind of stayed away from the public eye.

2344
02:36:14,408 --> 02:36:24,251
[SPEAKER_08]: She really doesn't want to give interviews ever to talk about it, but she did talk about it in 2006, and she said that her favorite game that she ever created was Phantasmagoria, not King's Quest.

2345
02:36:24,671 --> 02:36:24,951
[SPEAKER_08]: She said,

2346
02:36:42,845 --> 02:36:46,387
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to say, before I go out and check on the pizza again, Fantasma Gloria was amazing.

2347
02:36:46,807 --> 02:36:47,007
[SPEAKER_01]: The end.

2348
02:36:47,027 --> 02:36:47,227
[SPEAKER_01]: It was.

2349
02:36:48,008 --> 02:36:48,468
[SPEAKER_08]: It was awesome.

2350
02:36:49,108 --> 02:36:50,889
[SPEAKER_08]: So many epic FMVs and stuff.

2351
02:36:52,150 --> 02:36:58,473
[SPEAKER_08]: Roberta Williams also went on to say that she said that her games are explicitly targeted towards a more affluent and educated audience.

2352
02:36:59,153 --> 02:37:02,355
[SPEAKER_08]: And it actually made people kind of criticize her that she was kind of an elitist.

2353
02:37:02,835 --> 02:37:06,297
[SPEAKER_08]: But she did sum up her feelings in 99 with an interview on Gamers Depot.

2354
02:37:06,677 --> 02:37:06,897
[SPEAKER_08]: Quote,

2355
02:37:09,458 --> 02:37:13,899
[SPEAKER_08]: Back then, the demographics of people who were into computer games was totally different, in my opinion, than they are today.

2356
02:37:14,359 --> 02:37:20,260
[SPEAKER_08]: Back then, computers were more expensive, which made them more exclusive to people who were maybe at a certain income level or education level.

2357
02:37:20,600 --> 02:37:23,620
[SPEAKER_08]: So the people who played computer games 15 years ago were that type of person.

2358
02:37:23,940 --> 02:37:28,681
[SPEAKER_08]: They probably didn't watch television as much, and the instant gratification era hadn't quite grown the way it has lately.

2359
02:37:29,101 --> 02:37:32,002
[SPEAKER_08]: I think in the last five or six years, the demographics have really changed.

2360
02:37:32,322 --> 02:37:35,883
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, this is my opinion, because computers are less expensive, so more people can afford them.

2361
02:37:36,203 --> 02:37:38,423
[SPEAKER_08]: More average people now feel they should own one.

2362
02:37:39,264 --> 02:37:53,400
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, well, back in 1987, 88, 89, if you had a computer with EGA graphics, a 20 meg hard drive with 512k RAM, that was like four or five grand.

2363
02:37:53,781 --> 02:37:55,062
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, you were loaded if you had a...

2364
02:37:57,905 --> 02:37:59,885
[SPEAKER_10]: IBM Desktop with Color back then.

2365
02:38:00,466 --> 02:38:02,686
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, you had to be really well off.

2366
02:38:02,787 --> 02:38:09,869
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to say our first Packard Bell was like a 386SX16 or something and it was like a $2,000 computer.

2367
02:38:10,190 --> 02:38:12,090
[SPEAKER_08]: It was very expensive.

2368
02:38:14,031 --> 02:38:23,315
[SPEAKER_08]: By the way, also Roberta Williams said in a 2006 interview that designing computer games is in the past for her now but she does want to write a historical novel someday.

2369
02:38:24,536 --> 02:38:25,156
[SPEAKER_08]: So there you go.

2370
02:38:26,777 --> 02:38:27,438
[SPEAKER_08]: That's awesome.

2371
02:38:27,478 --> 02:38:31,661
[SPEAKER_08]: She was on the cover of Soft Porn Adventure by Online Systems.

2372
02:38:32,141 --> 02:38:33,302
[SPEAKER_08]: She's actually on the cover.

2373
02:38:33,382 --> 02:38:34,683
[SPEAKER_08]: That is crazy.

2374
02:38:35,604 --> 02:38:36,124
[SPEAKER_08]: How funny.

2375
02:38:36,985 --> 02:38:48,654
[SPEAKER_10]: I almost chose Leisure Suit Larry 3 for my pick because aside from the whole EGA boobies, it's an incredibly difficult and fun adventure game.

2376
02:38:49,594 --> 02:38:50,015
[SPEAKER_08]: Very cool.

2377
02:38:52,016 --> 02:39:17,471
[SPEAKER_08]: also her last game she's credited with is King's Quest Mask of Eternity in 98 which I'm assuming is King's Quest 8 which was the last official King's Quest game I wonder what capacity she worked on that game because that was three years after Phantasmagoria in 95 and she didn't do anything in Phantasmagoria 2 so there you go

2378
02:39:19,591 --> 02:39:20,172
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2379
02:39:20,352 --> 02:39:24,535
[SPEAKER_08]: That was kind of a nice little derivative there to talk about that.

2380
02:39:25,376 --> 02:39:27,117
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we'll go ahead and kind of take a quick break.

2381
02:39:27,177 --> 02:39:33,483
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll give us a chance to eat here and get the other pizza done, and we're going to just play a little bit of music, save this part of the show we have done so far.

2382
02:39:33,823 --> 02:39:34,844
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to take a quick break, guys.

2383
02:39:34,864 --> 02:39:36,365
[SPEAKER_08]: When we come back, we'll do more of your questions.

2384
02:39:36,385 --> 02:39:44,732
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll do more calls, too, and a couple more stories for you guys as well when we come back with the Orange Lounge Radio Marathon live here at All Games Radio.

2385
02:39:44,752 --> 02:39:45,373
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll be right back.
