00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And welcome back, everybody, to the Orange Lounge Radio Marathon. That's right, we're doing a marathon podcast this week, basically just because we can.

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We're gonna podcast as long as we possibly can here on this Saturday, September the 5th of 2010. It won't be anything that impressive, you guys.

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We're thinking about going about for 12 hours or so, just, you know, talking about video games and reminiscing about old games and all that good stuff.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:34,000
So, we just finished the normal show, so if this is the first thing that you're hearing on the podcast feed, you're gonna wanna go back.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
The actual show show was put up earlier this week, so just, you know, double check your podcast feed to make sure you kinda have everything.

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:50,000
At the very end of the show, we had some problems with our chat room. Our internet went down right in the middle of everything and we ended up getting booted from our server.

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And all this stuff, it was terrible, but we think we've got that all worked out. Thank you to Alan, who is, like, a bigger nerd than me.

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I never thought I would be able to say that, but yes, he's a bigger nerd than me. He knew how to set this whole thing up.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
What are we doing right now, Alan? How are we getting an IRC?

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:13,000
My roommate has a domain name that he uses for a little Linux box that we run out of our spare bedroom. It's a little mail server.

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So we're SSH'd into that box and we're running IRC from there. So we're just shelled into my computer at home.

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Alright.

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I got a little OCD with the mic cord.

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Okay, well, we'll fix it later, but we're gonna go into the vault. Jamie and Arkadia42 are on their way into the vault and gonna take over for a little bit here, talking about old stuff.

15
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Dark Soccer, everybody.

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Dark Soccer, tell us a little bit about the vault.

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It's a room in the back of my house. A room in the back of my house that has all of our game crap in it.

18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
And I totally meant to grab my iPhone so that I could actually, you know, take pictures and put them up on the website.

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I could try doing the Ustream thing real fast. I don't know how well this is gonna work, but I'll try it.

20
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Alright.

21
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You know, actually, Alan, you could read chat for a little bit. Oh, you wanna be cameraman? I'll do cameraman for a minute here.

22
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
This is all live radio, folks.

23
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
So, everyone has to come in here and pick one thing.

24
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Alright, we'll come in here in a minute.

25
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm gonna see if I can do this broadcasting. Okay, let's see.

26
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Well, since we're already in here, Bradley, why don't you pick something?

27
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Dark Soccer, I'm gonna bring in the camera, okay?

28
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm gonna bring in the camera, is that okay?

29
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Okay, just so long as it's not me on it.

30
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I'll try my best. Just dodge my phone.

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Then I better put my phone back in here.

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Alright.

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I had Bradley pick something.

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Yeah, yeah.

35
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Alright, we're live, and I don't even know where we're at.

36
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,000
We're at Ustream slash Orange Lounge, I think, is where we're broadcasting at.

37
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
So, I'm gonna go make my way into the vault.

38
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'll give my mic to Alan while I walk over there.

39
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Right now, we have Bradley going through the Saturn section of my house, which is pretty much our domestic Saturn stuff.

40
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Yeah, at the moment.

41
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
The dusty little things here.

42
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It always takes me a while to decide on these things.

43
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Let's look here.

44
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Which voices?

45
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Well, is it like candy?

46
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
What was that?

47
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Is it like candy?

48
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Yeah.

49
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Let's see.

50
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I saw one up here.

51
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Blazing Dragons. That was a fun game, because it's like a puzzle game where you control the dragon and...

52
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Let's go ahead and pull it out.

53
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Oh, where'd it go?

54
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Put it on the camera.

55
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Oh, there's some top, I think.

56
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Yeah.

57
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Right there.

58
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Oh, they're Capcom shot glasses.

59
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Right there.

60
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I think that's what it was.

61
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Go ahead and put it up on the...

62
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Basically, it's a comedy puzzle game where you go around and try to figure out how to solve certain puzzles,

63
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
where you've got to satisfy what a person wants you to do for them.

64
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Something like you needed to wash all the dishes, so you have to put together a Rube Goldberg device to rig up the dishes.

65
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Basically, it puts something on top of a fire to blow a turntable around or a fan around so that they can put it in a system.

66
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:31,000
And there's catapulting one place where you have to shoot a cat at a wall.

67
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,000
And if you miss, it makes noises at you and runs back, or actually does it for each time.

68
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Okay.

69
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It's a pretty fun game.

70
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Well, Rob, your turn to pick something.

71
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
What am I...

72
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Am I on here? I don't even know.

73
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Is it recording? Is it going through, Alan?

74
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Okay.

75
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
We don't usually do remote broadcasting from the other rooms, so this is a little different for us.

76
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
So I don't know what to pick.

77
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Okay, you want to hold this while I dig through something?

78
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Yeah.

79
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Okay. Hold on.

80
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Because I'm going to...

81
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
This is awesome radio, I'm sure.

82
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I see all these NES games up here, and I'm assuming that one of these is going to be something awesome.

83
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
It could be.

84
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Or it could suck. I don't know.

85
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
God, you have all these Japanese games stacked on top of everything, too.

86
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I know.

87
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
What are those? Let's see.

88
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I don't know.

89
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Oh, Final Fantasy III and Mappy.

90
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
And Mappy, and apparently you paid 20 bucks for each of them.

91
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
No, I didn't. I paid five.

92
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
They were marked down.

93
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
They were marked down.

94
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Let's see, what's in this one here?

95
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Gradius, Track and Field, Contra.

96
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Did I just push the button?

97
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
What happened? Did it?

98
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
It locked.

99
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It locked?

100
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Warning, you stopped. Okay, go live.

101
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Yeah.

102
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Okay, now we're connecting now.

103
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It wants to keep following us. Maybe we have to plug it in, I don't know.

104
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Okay, we're connected now.

105
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Alright.

106
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Sorry.

107
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I don't know, I wasn't prepared to dig through here.

108
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Rob broke the...

109
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Hold on, let me look at Super Nintendo.

110
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Right behind you.

111
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Help.

112
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Yeah.

113
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Got your mic.

114
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Hi.

115
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Hello.

116
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:03,000
So I think someone looked up the correct channel name and put it in IRC.

117
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I think it's orange-lounge-radio for the Ustream.

118
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Oh.

119
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
So that's all taken care of.

120
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Alright, good. Good deal.

121
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Let's see.

122
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You got all these Mega Man games in this one. That's kind of fun.

123
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Yeah.

124
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
What's in this?

125
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Rob started to make the face.

126
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I did, because I... I'll talk about this game.

127
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Yep, it's Super Metroid.

128
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Can you give me a mic?

129
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:48,000
So Super Metroid is the game I picked up there, and Super Metroid is probably like one of the greatest video games they ever frickin' made, ever.

130
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It's probably my favorite video game of all time, happens to be in this little bin right here.

131
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
If I can hold this up for the Ustream viewers too.

132
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Super Metroid is Amazeballs because it's kind of a quick game.

133
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:05,000
It's not something that takes you days and days to beat, so you can play through it in a good sitting in a day.

134
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
If you wanted to play through this tonight, we probably could.

135
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
We could play this all in one sitting.

136
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I probably could play through the entire game if I could remember the whole thing. I don't know.

137
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I like Super Metroid because it has a lot of that replayability and re-exploreability value to it.

138
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
There's different ways you can play the game. You can play to be a completionist.

139
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
You can play to be a speed runner.

140
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You can play to show off different tricks or try to find things that are hidden.

141
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:39,000
It really set the stage for things that followed it that are also awesome, like Castlevania, which a lot of people started calling Metroidvania.

142
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
The music was phenomenal, and the upgrades to the weapons.

143
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Everything about it was just super.

144
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
That's why Super Metroid is definitely a fond favorite of mine.

145
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:57,000
That's something I've talked about many times on the show before. It's one of my personal favorite games.

146
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
We need to find a box for it, I think.

147
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Okay, so, Alan, it's your turn. Pick something that you see.

148
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
So, Alan's currently digging through the vault.

149
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I don't know if I like this whole Ustream thing, though, because it's too much for us to monitor, because trying to run the radio feed is bad enough.

150
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
So, we might kill this video feed.

151
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I've just been running my thumb over it to keep it active.

152
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Alright, I'm going to kill the video feed for now until we have something a little more worthy of showing on video.

153
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Sorry, guys.

154
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Sorry, guys.

155
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
But it's also killing the battery on my phone.

156
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Oh, my phone is hot. It feels like it's going to explode in my hand, so that's probably not a good thing.

157
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Is it gushy?

158
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
So, tell the listeners a little bit about where you collect all of these different games from.

159
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Every freaking where. I mean, seriously.

160
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:06,000
We used to just go hit up thrift stores and the flea market and a couple of used game places in town and just pick up things when we could find them.

161
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Like, when we got our Nomad, it was right when they stopped making the Nomads and we managed to get ours on clearance for $25.

162
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,000
So, I mean, some of these will just, you know, luck into a pretty awesome sale.

163
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:29,000
And, like, we got a big box of Master System games for, I want to say, like, $100 for 200 games or something like that.

164
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
You found something?

165
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Yes.

166
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Marvel Super Heroes for the Sega Saturn.

167
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:45,000
One of the advantages of owning a Saturn in the US compared to the original PlayStation was that the original PlayStation was crap for 2D games.

168
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:54,000
The Saturn could do arcade perfect frame rates for all of the over-the-top Capcom X-Men licensed games like Children of the Atom.

169
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I got my Saturn for this game.

170
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
And then I got it chipped and I imported Darkstalkers 3 and X-Men vs. Street Fighter.

171
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
So, this is definitely a lot of hours logged on this one.

172
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I really like that game. Although, I wonder what it would have been like if they had released the 1 meg and 4 meg cart in the US.

173
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
If that would have just made it completely a lot more awesome.

174
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Because that's why X-Men vs. Street Fighter is only really playable on the Saturn.

175
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Because of the cartridge.

176
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Okay, my turn. Shoot, this is all my shit.

177
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Crap.

178
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I know hue cards are in there somewhere.

179
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Have you done some rearranging in the vault lately?

180
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Dan did some.

181
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
You guys took the couch out of here.

182
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
The futon is gone. We got rid of it.

183
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Oh wow, I was thinking we'd all have a futon to sit on in here, but I guess that's not the case.

184
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
So we will have to go out to the front room at some point.

185
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Hopefully our mics will get us out there too.

186
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
That'll be good.

187
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I'm sure.

188
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
God, I can't think.

189
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I'm noticing Atari 2600 stuff here.

190
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Yeah, this is sort of our, we have nowhere else to put this stuff, shelf.

191
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Let's see, man.

192
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
So we can friend your butt.

193
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Okay, I think this is...

194
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Nope, that's not it. It's a soundtrack for Berserk.

195
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
For the video game.

196
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Now, just so you guys know, we did have to kill the video stream because it was just a little janky,

197
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
but if you do want to see more of the vault on our YouTube channel,

198
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
which is youtube.com slash orange lounge radio, if I'm not mistaken,

199
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
we do actually have a clip.

200
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It's like a little tour of Dark Sakura's vault.

201
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
It's been redone since then.

202
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It has changed a little bit.

203
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
We do need to get some new video other than what we just showed on Ustream,

204
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
but you can get an idea just how massive this collection is.

205
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Like, you know, I'm looking one way and I see two TVs up on the wall,

206
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
PlayStation 2 rack of games, I see Neo Geo games,

207
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I see all these arcade sticks,

208
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I look another way, I see different steering wheels,

209
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I pick something.

210
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
A CDX.

211
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
The CDX.

212
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
You're not picking a game, you're picking a CDX.

213
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Well, if I didn't say you had to pick a game, I should have picked something.

214
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Alright, fine. What do you want to say about the CDX?

215
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,000
It's awesome, and it's like having a really tiny Sega CD,

216
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
although it does not work very well with the 32X,

217
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
you have to kind of modify the hookup and get these brackets to hold it up,

218
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
but the CDX is freaking awesome.

219
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
And I love it. I love it quite dearly.

220
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
How'd you guys end up with two Gamegears over here?

221
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I'm looking at two Gamegears. One of them's blue and one of them's black.

222
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I think the blue one is Julie's.

223
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Nice.

224
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
You just stole it.

225
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
No, she, okay, look at the Dreamcast dance pads.

226
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
One of those is hers. She bought it.

227
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
It never has been in her house.

228
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
It has always been at my house, so it's pretty much mine anyway now.

229
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
And same with the Gamegears. I think she just left it with us, so it's ours.

230
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
It's kind of like when the neighbor throws a ball in your yard,

231
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
and it's like, you know, see this? It's mine now, you little brats.

232
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
We got this for our Nintendo points, the Game & Watch collection.

233
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I owned a Gamegear briefly in the eighth grade, and I've seen one now.

234
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I do not remember it being that gigantic.

235
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
It's huge. It's like bigger than a VHS tape. I don't...

236
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
And they're heavy. Well, we've got the battery attached to this,

237
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
the little backup battery thing.

238
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Yeah, I don't...

239
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Well, you want to see big, though. We've got links somewhere around here.

240
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
And all of our stuff is so dusty.

241
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Do we have another mic on the ground?

242
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Yeah, we've got stuff everywhere.

243
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I like this stress script, Game Boy Advance.

244
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:41,000
That was a promo thing from E3, I think, a while back.

245
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I have a GBA that I mailed it in and got it modded for the backlight.

246
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
So it's mine. We still have mine.

247
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
And then the week after I got it back, they announced the clamshell.

248
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
But I actually like the bigger model.

249
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
The SP?

250
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Yeah, the SP. I actually like the bigger model better for my hands.

251
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I actually had a pink Game Boy Advance, just to be completely opposite of what everyone would think of me.

252
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Because I normally hate pink.

253
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
And I actually really dug my pink one and had pink everything.

254
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I don't know if you noticed, but a reoccurring theme in my Saturn collection is Working Designs and Capcom.

255
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I still have my copy of Rayearth that Working Designs did for the Saturn.

256
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
It's one of the last games that came out for the Saturn in the US.

257
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Let me see what I've got up here. Rayearth right here.

258
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I loved that they took out all the spoken dialogue from the Japanese version.

259
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Because it used up so much memory and made the game so laggy.

260
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Oh wow.

261
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Because it did comments over every little thing they picked up.

262
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Instead they just left it all text.

263
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
We believe you can read.

264
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
We have Iron Storm.

265
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Probably that so they can have the voice actors doing all the work for that one.

266
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Snake of Ages.

267
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
What's that one right there?

268
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Can I actually jump in here, you guys, real quick?

269
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I'm actually in the other room, or I'm watching the chat room.

270
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I actually want to jump in here and say real quick, because it is 6 o'clock Pacific at this time.

271
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
We might have some folks tuning in right now expecting to hear Orange On's radio, kind of like as it normally is.

272
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
You forgot that this week is the marathon episode.

273
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
We've actually been on the air since 2 p.m.

274
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
If you're just joining us now expecting to hear the normal episode of OLR, it already happened.

275
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
We finished that up at about 5.30.

276
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Loki is gone. He went back to go take care of the baby.

277
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
But I'm here. Rob Roberts and Dark Soccer is here as well.

278
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
As well as Salacious Pop and Arcadium 42.

279
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Right now we're looking in the vault at some old games.

280
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Just kind of thumbing through and seeing what nostalgic dust is.

281
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Literal dust.

282
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Awakened from some of it.

283
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Yeah, we were going through my list of working designs games.

284
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
So yeah, back here, that's Albert Odyssey, I think.

285
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Yeah, actually I decided to sell my copy of that off.

286
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I've only played a little bit of it, but neither has run out of money.

287
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:05,000
We've also got Shining Wisdom, Dragon Force, Sonic R.

288
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I love Sonic R, don't get me wrong.

289
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
No.

290
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Can you feel the sunshine?

291
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Does it brighten up your day?

292
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
But yeah, we've got tons of crap.

293
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Dude, now I want to break out the Saturn for reals and play stuff,

294
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
but Dan has the Saturn hooked up in here, and the monitor is, like, little.

295
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I want to play the Saturn in the front room.

296
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
So the stuff that we actually have hooked up right now in here,

297
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
because we've got things set up on Switch boxes.

298
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:41,000
We've got an Xbox 360, Dreamcast, Saturn, GameCube Neo Geo CD,

299
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Super Nintendo, Turbo Duo, and the Sega CD 32X.

300
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:54,000
And what else do we have sort of put away?

301
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Where did Dan put the actual Neo Geo?

302
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Because we actually have a Neo Geo.

303
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
And then, I think it's funny, Dan got the Atari Flashback 2

304
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
that looks like the old 2600, but it's got 40 games stored in it.

305
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
And, you know, I could break out my What the Fuck game.

306
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Cardcaptor Sakura that comes with a plate, and a clock, and silverware.

307
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I think you showed all that in the unboxing video that you did on YouTube.

308
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
It's in the unboxing video.

309
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Because, man, I'm not trying to sound braggy or anything.

310
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I mean, we just have the stuff.

311
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
And, oh, the R4 with the JOGCON set.

312
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I got that for painting a Sonic on the door of a local used game store.

313
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I remember video game swappers back in the day.

314
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
But that's how I got my R4 and JOGCON.

315
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
And we've got the boxes of controllers.

316
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
And they're just different systems and stuff.

317
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Here's the box of PlayStation controllers, which I think the NEGCON is in.

318
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I'm going to fish that out.

319
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Who wants my mic?

320
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Actually, I wanted to ask you some questions about the vault here.

321
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I'm sorry, we keep switching positions and everything,

322
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
but I'm making my way back into the vault,

323
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
because it's much cooler in here than it is in the actual studio

324
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
where all the computers are going.

325
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Uh-oh, Dark Sakura's trying to get this big plastic bin.

326
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
It looks like they store a lot of controllers and power cords

327
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
and all that stuff in these big plastic bins

328
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,000
to help keep things kind of separated.

329
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
What are you looking for, Dark Sakura?

330
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
My NEGCON.

331
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Wow. You guys have some really obscure stuff.

332
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Let's talk about the vault for a little bit,

333
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
because we have a lot of people in chat,

334
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
and I'm sure a lot of listeners of the show that are like,

335
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
wow, you guys are kind of like a special kind of crazy,

336
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:49,000
having your own room in the house dedicated to a video game museum sort of thing.

337
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
And how did this all start between you and Dan?

338
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Oh, gee. Well, when Dan and I first got together,

339
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
he had already had a bunch of stuff.

340
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I mean, he had a Neo Geo and a few games,

341
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
and he had a NES, and he had a SNES,

342
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
and I moved out here with my SNES and a few PlayStation games,

343
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
and he had a PlayStation and a Saturn.

344
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
And we just sort of would get nostalgic about stuff

345
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:21,000
and go looking for things, and we ended up getting the Turbo Duo.

346
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
No, I think he already had the Turbo Duo when I moved out here.

347
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Let me take it a step back.

348
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I know you've told this story sometimes on the show before.

349
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
We have time to kill tonight.

350
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
How did you and Dan kind of end up meeting?

351
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
How did you and Dan kind of come together?

352
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Yeah, have a seat.

353
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
We're sitting on the floor of the vault just chatting.

354
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
No chatters right now.

355
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Sorry, chat room, but you're in the other room where we can't see you,

356
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
but we'll run back and look in a minute.

357
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Back in the day when I lived in Mobile, Alabama,

358
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Dan was a friend of mine online, and my roommates introduced me to him

359
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,000
because he had the name Dark Ryoga, and I had the name Dark Uchon.

360
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
So we hung out for a while, and he was my buddy,

361
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,000
and would be up really late my time, relatively late his time.

362
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
And just exchanged bad fan fiction, and he was my buddy.

363
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
He was fun.

364
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:20,000
And then I had a really, really bad breakup with the guy I was with at the time,

365
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
and Dan called me to cheer me up.

366
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
He had some five-minute calling cards,

367
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
and he ended up using three of them, I think, that night.

368
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
And then we ended up talking the next night, and I called him,

369
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:37,000
and he called me, and we'd talk on the pay phone from Denny's and stuff.

370
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
And then finally one day, at the time I was working at,

371
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I think had since moved from working at the arcade.

372
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I worked for Aladdin's Castle and Cyber Station at the malls.

373
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:55,000
But I went from working there to working at this herb shop kiosk in the mall,

374
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
and it was really great.

375
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I could sit and read my books all day if I wanted to.

376
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
So Dan, we had been talking the night before

377
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
because we were trying to open up another store

378
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
so that we could make enough revenue to keep two stores open

379
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
instead of having to close the one we had.

380
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,000
And I said, hey, if we don't get the show, the store,

381
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
then can I come out and stay with you?

382
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I was just joking.

383
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
He was like, I guess so.

384
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
And so the next day I go to work, and they said,

385
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
yeah, they gave our spot to somebody else.

386
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
We have to close the store in a month.

387
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I was like, so when my boss left, I called Dan,

388
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
and I was like, so were you serious?

389
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
He's like, I guess so.

390
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
We're going to go see Batman.

391
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
We'll talk about this later.

392
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
If that dates when the conversation happened.

393
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Wait, the original Batman was like 91.

394
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
It can't be that Batman.

395
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
No.

396
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
It was some.

397
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
One of the sequels.

398
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
One, yeah.

399
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
No, 89 was the original Batman.

400
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Yeah.

401
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
But anyway.

402
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Yeah.

403
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
But at any rate, I was actually on the plane

404
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
probably within two weeks.

405
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
And I've been happy here ever since I came out here

406
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
with 100 bucks in my pocket and a Super Nintendo.

407
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Did you literally pack a Super Nintendo in your luggage?

408
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Did you leave everything at home when you came?

409
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I packed a trunk full of stuff.

410
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I packed a big old bag full of stuff, taped it up,

411
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
and brought it on the plane with me,

412
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
and amongst it was my Super Nintendo.

413
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Wow.

414
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
And all my games.

415
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Wow.

416
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
And my one PlayStation game.

417
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
No, my two PlayStation games.

418
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
And I didn't even own a PlayStation.

419
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
It was Dragon Ball GT Final Bout and Final Fantasy VII.

420
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Whatever happened to all your stuff at home?

421
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Did you ever go back to get it,

422
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
or did you just have it shipped here in little bits and pieces,

423
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
or did you just kind of let it rot, or what?

424
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Well, I would go back and visit and bring stuff back with me,

425
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
and Grandmom would send me some of my stuff,

426
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
and little things like that, but I lost a lot.

427
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I kept bringing back boxes of comics for some reason.

428
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
But a lot of my books were water damaged

429
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
from how poorly they were being stored.

430
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:52,000
And I lost a lot of cool stuff.

431
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I did manage to bring back a lot of cool stuff with me.

432
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
So most of my things, I think, are back with me.

433
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I lost stuff from my dorm room I really wanted,

434
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
because they were things that people picked up for me

435
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
from Civil War reenactments and rent fares and things.

436
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Okay, so now we're kind of getting caught up

437
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
to where we were at before, is that you came out here

438
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
and you had only the Super Nintendo

439
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
and a couple PlayStation games,

440
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
but you obviously had this nerd love thing

441
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
going on with Dan, right?

442
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Yeah.

443
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Oh, that's from the EVA.

444
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
So you guys just kind of started mutually

445
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
this collection together.

446
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Do you remember what the first thing was

447
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
you guys bought together? Do you remember?

448
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I don't really remember all that well, to be honest.

449
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
That's okay.

450
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I know one of the early things,

451
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
because I think he already had a Genesis,

452
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
we picked up a Sega CD together.

453
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
That was one of the first things that we got,

454
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
because we really wanted to play Sega CD games.

455
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
And we found it cheap, and then we got 32X after that.

456
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,000
And it just kept growing, really.

457
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
We would just find things.

458
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Oh, shoot, I was listing out all my stuff

459
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
and I forgot to put my WinterSwan color on it.

460
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
No, no, I was recently putting all my stuff up

461
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
for Infamous.net, because they wanted the list

462
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
of my gaming systems, and I forgot the WinterSwan.

463
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Well, now you're just going to lose all that cred.

464
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
But the way things went, it was just,

465
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
we would run in and, oh, that's cool,

466
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
oh, that's cool, oh, that's cool.

467
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
And then, you know, we'd sometimes say,

468
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
I really want to play this game.

469
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,000
So we picked up a Neo Geo, not Neo Geo, a Turbo Duo,

470
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
not Turbo Duo, PC Engine Core Graphics.

471
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Sorry, I had to think of system and country and everything,

472
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:38,000
which is the Japanese version of the Turbo Graphics.

473
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
And because you cannot play the HuCard games.

474
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
They are not compatible.

475
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:49,000
There's one converter that's supposed to work okay.

476
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
We could never get to work, and if you find

477
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
it's super expensive, we may as well just buy the system.

478
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
So we got a Core Graphics so we could play

479
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
our Japanese HuCards.

480
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
A lot of it is just like, it's here,

481
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
we have the money right now, why don't we get it?

482
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
And then Dan was working at GameStop and then GameCrazy,

483
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
so when he knew stuff that come out,

484
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
it'd be like, let's get it.

485
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
And when the PS3 came out, he had just quit GameStop,

486
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:18,000
but he had put in his pre-register, pre-order as manager,

487
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
so he was first in line, so he went and got it.

488
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
And then Discover gave us $100 credit back

489
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
because he had spent so much.

490
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
So we basically got our $700 system for $600.

491
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
And we still have it, our original PS3 works just fine.

492
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
So it's just one of those things where your collection

493
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
just kept growing and growing and growing,

494
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
and then it suddenly needed its own room

495
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
because you're just both gamers.

496
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
I wonder what that is behind you.

497
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Will you grab me that black and blue case please?

498
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
The black and blue case, hold on.

499
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
I want to see what it is.

500
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Because keep in mind, we also have a lot of stuff

501
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
just packed up in, oh it's empty isn't it?

502
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
It feels empty.

503
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Because we've just got stuff packed up in bags and things,

504
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
old systems, like I think one of the things behind you

505
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
is an Xbox.

506
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
In that black and red case there,

507
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
that's where we keep the Neo Geo.

508
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Like the AVS cartridge Neo Geo.

509
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
And someone just sold us a Neo CD for like $100

510
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
with a bunch of games.

511
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
So like I said, when we get these things,

512
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
they sort of fall into our lap.

513
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Where do you think all this stuff's going to end up someday?

514
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Like do you see yourselves hanging on to this forever?

515
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Or what's going to happen, passing it on to children?

516
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Dan's talked about selling it a couple of times,

517
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
but then we get talking about it and neither of us

518
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
can really see ourselves parting with it.

519
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Because it's not like somebody's going to call hoarders on you guys

520
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
because you really neatly have stacked everything

521
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
and it seems like there's organized chaos in here.

522
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Yeah, and we pull stuff out all the time to play with it.

523
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
And I wouldn't say you guys are like obsessive compulsive either.

524
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
It's not really like that.

525
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
It's just this collection that has gone insane.

526
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:52,000
It really just sort of happened up there with all the Bimani stuff

527
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
when we really got into music games.

528
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
We just kept getting controllers and systems and,

529
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
oh, American Beatmania 2DX, let's get it.

530
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,000
And the guitar freaks, we both had to have a guitar.

531
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
And then I found the drum kit really cheap from,

532
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
not Toys N' Joys, but it was another importer.

533
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Speaking randomly of American 2DX,

534
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
I wanted to throw this out here.

535
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Because it wasn't news that made the earlier show.

536
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
But Naoki runs a Facebook.

537
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
And it really is him. I asked him when I saw him at E3.

538
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
It's his Facebook.

539
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
And he was actually asking questions about music games on there this week.

540
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
And he actually said, what type of music game is your favorite?

541
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
And would you want to see another karaoke type of game?

542
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
And overwhelmingly, it seemed the response was like,

543
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
no, we don't need any more karaoke games.

544
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
And everybody was like, 2DX, 2DX, 2DX.

545
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Bring 2DX on the PS3. Please release on the PS3.

546
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Because if they did release it, it would be region free.

547
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Where even if they released it in Japan,

548
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
you know you're going to have tons of people over here buying it.

549
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Oh, hell yes.

550
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
That might be part of the reason it's getting held up.

551
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Maybe they're having problems with music licenses or what have you.

552
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Although I don't think they license a lot of music for BeatMania anymore.

553
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
I don't know.

554
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Well, I actually answered on the thing too.

555
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Did you?

556
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
And I was reading other people's responses. They were funny.

557
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I did, but I got in late.

558
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
But yeah, the Pink Biscuits up there.

559
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
I think we bought a friend of ours, Para Para.

560
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Para Para.

561
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Up at the very top to the left of Samba de Amigo in keyboard mania.

562
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Which soon the Kinect is going to be taking the place of some of that type of stuff.

563
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
It's funny how technology has come.

564
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
I really want a Para Para game. I want a Tech Para game.

565
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Well, our other thing too is that Dan and I like playing games with good controllers.

566
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
We love controllers.

567
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
What other good, like, back in the day topics can we talk about?

568
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
We can talk about trying to remember the first time we all met.

569
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
I don't know if I totally remember the very first time I met our Sakura.

570
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
I remember.

571
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
It was at Milpitas Golf Land playing Para Para.

572
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
And you showed up with Jessica.

573
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
I did, yeah.

574
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:56,000
And she was, for those that followed the DDR scene for a long time, she was a Guana girl.

575
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
One of the administrators, I think, for a while on the DDR Freak forums.

576
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
She's still listed as one. I don't think she does anything.

577
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
I think she's like a legacy administrator or something.

578
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
I'm still there as a moderator.

579
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:13,000
A lot of people don't know that is that she and I actually played our very first game of DDR together.

580
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
And it's kind of funny because we both ended up taking on...

581
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
We actually went...

582
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
And I think this is kind of common knowledge now.

583
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
We had a spat for many years.

584
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
We had a personal disagreement that just got way out of control and it was really ugly.

585
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,000
And we've worked our stuff out since then and we have a pleasant friendship and everything.

586
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
And I think it's great that she's back on Understadation Live.

587
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
And I know her and Travis have always had a really funny conversation style.

588
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
So that's really cool and I'm happy for her.

589
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
A lot of people don't know that a lot of us...

590
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
We kind of started that whole thing together.

591
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
And she went on to do this thing with DDR Freak.

592
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
And then I went on to start OLR with you guys.

593
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,000
It's just kind of really funny how we kind of branched off and did these big projects.

594
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:57,000
The DDR Freak thing sort of came up right just after, I think, we started Orange Lounge.

595
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
DDR Freak Radio was a project and it was always...

596
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,000
I haven't talked about this a lot, but we're in the marathon part of the show.

597
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
We don't expect a lot of people to listen to.

598
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
When DDR Freak Radio kind of first came out, we were...

599
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
At least I think you kind of knew about both projects.

600
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
We couldn't say anything because you kind of had to walk this delicate line, right?

601
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Which is what I was doing for a long time.

602
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,000
And when I found out, I was a little bit irritated, truthfully.

603
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Because we had that kind of personal conflict going on.

604
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,000
But then I was like, dammit, this whole idea that I've really tried to take off the ground and so forth.

605
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Like, you know, was just kind of like shot in the foot.

606
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
But then you kind of take lemons and you make lemonade, right?

607
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:42,000
So it's like, okay, well, if they're going to do this thing, how can we do this and make it our own?

608
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
And make it, you know, its own type of thing.

609
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,000
And then it turns out we started OLR with the Dance Mania stuff incorporated.

610
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
The talk radio was built into that as well.

611
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
So, you know, that kind of ended up being our shtick.

612
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
I think DDR Freak is still on at Live Through the Five, but I don't think it's maintained.

613
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Our real strength has always been our versatility.

614
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,000
And it was, I think a lot of people don't realize that...

615
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
This is Alex.

616
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Hi, Alex. How are you doing?

617
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Come in real quick. Say hi to everybody.

618
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
We're actually broadcasting our marathon. I don't know if Dan told you.

619
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
We're on a marathon episode of our show right now.

620
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Marathon.

621
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
It was a marathon. How are you doing, Alex?

622
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Doing pretty good.

623
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
You have an online, you got to get real close to the, these mics aren't very sensitive.

624
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Do you have an online name you use that you want people to know?

625
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,000
I suppose you can tell people that I use the name Five Gears.

626
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Five Gears. Alright, Five Gears. What kind of games do you play?

627
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Mostly single player today. I can't afford to play Xbox Live.

628
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Did you hear they're jacking up the price? Ten bucks. We just talked about that earlier.

629
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Yeah, that's, well, I don't usually play online anymore.

630
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
But when I did, it was a lot of Halo.

631
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:54,000
And I'm probably going to have to, depending on how Reach goes, because I'm going to try that out.

632
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Not that it's here or anything. Just, you know, you're going to try it someday. Legally.

633
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Oh, of course.

634
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Absolutely.

635
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:07,000
But when I try it out, I'll see if it's worth actually playing.

636
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:12,000
And playing online with friends is really the only reason why I ever did it in the first place.

637
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
I have all kinds of online games on PC.

638
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Like Mr. World of Warcraft here.

639
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Hey, hey, hey. Not going to lie.

640
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
World of Warcraft. I used to play that.

641
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I still do. I was talking about the Cataclysm beta earlier in the show.

642
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Yeah.

643
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Playing that a little bit.

644
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
When are you going to get the needle in your arm, man?

645
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
My hands are going to be epic. When my friends stop playing.

646
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Because honestly, it's the only reason I play. No, really. I mean, it is.

647
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,000
And they're my real-life friends. And people I know, like in the Bay Area and Allen, we all play together.

648
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
And it's like, you know, it's just kind of like the thing now.

649
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,000
You know, I could give a shit about the game itself a lot of days.

650
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,000
But it's just kind of the way we all hang out. It's kind of nerdy, but awesome.

651
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:52,000
No, no, no. That's fine. You know, it used to be, for me, it was all about just playing first-person shooters online with people.

652
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Well, that's what my college buddies and I used to do.

653
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:00,000
We used to play Quake online. We used to play Halo 2 for a long time. All that good stuff.

654
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Yeah, no. For me right now, if I do play online at all, it's Bad Company 2 on PC.

655
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
All right. By the way, you should be voicing movie trailers. Just so you know.

656
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
What's your Solid Snake impression?

657
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Another Solid Snake impression? In a wor-

658
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:19,000
I'm getting my impressions mixed up.

659
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Allen's looking at Chad, and they think he's Solid Snake?

660
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Yeah.

661
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Awesome.

662
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
If you want to look at Chad and read us some comments, there's a mic in there that's hot.

663
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,000
You just have to be loud enough for us to hear you back here.

664
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
He's going in there.

665
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
He's going in there to see if Chad-

666
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
We're fucking bad.

667
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
I feel bad because we've been neglecting the chat room, but we're having-

668
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
We heart you, Chad.

669
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
We're having memories.

670
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
We heart you, Chad.

671
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Here.

672
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Memories.

673
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Where was I? I was talking about the conflict that Iguana Girl and I had, but we're cool now.

674
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
And then I was talking about-

675
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Yeah, now she hates me.

676
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Well-

677
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
I can't give a shit.

678
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
I'm trying to stay with the positive.

679
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
I am.

680
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,000
But I was talking about the conflict, but then, okay, the day, there was a New Year's.

681
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Was it 05 or 06, I think?

682
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Something like that?

683
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
That she came- Well, it was after we buried the hatchet.

684
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,000
It had to be just based on other events.

685
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
I know that happened around that time.

686
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
I think it was 05.

687
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:18,000
We actually ended up doing a broadcast from Orange Lounge Studios for DDR Free Radio.

688
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:24,000
That was like the Nintendo and Sega logos appearing at the same time when you first boot up some of it, like F-Zero and some of those.

689
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
That was a huge event.

690
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Yeah.

691
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
But a lot of people didn't know the difference.

692
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
We did the New Year's.

693
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
But it was huge.

694
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
The New Year's Bimani countdown.

695
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Yeah.

696
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
But it was good.

697
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
I'm glad that all worked out.

698
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Anyhow, wow, didn't mean to get off on those topics.

699
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
We were back on talking about how we first met.

700
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Let's grab a box of games.

701
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Well, I got to Dan and me meeting and me moving out here and us, our children multiplying.

702
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:54,000
I'm sorry, our games multiplying.

703
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:02,000
But I really didn't, though, get my own group of friends until I started going to Gothland and playing in the arcades there.

704
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Because I was playing DDR at home already.

705
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,000
And BeatMania, I had BM98 if you remember the old emulator.

706
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
And I was playing some of the games and I was like, oh yeah, these are fun.

707
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
I get to bring over stuff.

708
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Oh yeah, this is fun.

709
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Which were my friends through Dan.

710
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
So I'd kind of hear about it.

711
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
And then I went to the arcade and it was Danielle.

712
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
You remember her?

713
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:26,000
I put my token up on the machine and she's like, one of us.

714
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Nice.

715
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:32,000
So and then everything kind of exploded and our group just got huge.

716
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:38,000
And I had a birthday party at Gothland on the floor in front of the fourth mix.

717
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,000
I remember the day the fourth mix hit Gothland, I actually called in sick.

718
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Well, I was already, I was like legitimately sick.

719
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
I called in because I was sick to work.

720
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
And then I found out that RVGL got fourth mix that day.

721
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
And I was like, I'm going, I don't even care that I'm sick.

722
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
I'm going, I'm going to go be one of the first people to play that machine.

723
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
And I was sick as a dog that I played it.

724
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
And I probably gave you all cooties.

725
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Although I do remember that I was the first person of us to play a Max.

726
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
How did that work?

727
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
I was in San Diego.

728
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Oh.

729
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:11,000
And the arcade there was like one of the few in SoCal that had it.

730
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Very cool.

731
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
So.

732
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Yeah, those, those Gothland nights used to be something else.

733
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
There they are.

734
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Oh, what'd you find?

735
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Dark soccer's reaching for, what is this, Saturn games?

736
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Dreamcast games.

737
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Wrong.

738
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Turbo graphics.

739
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Oh, snap.

740
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
R-Type.

741
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Space Harrier.

742
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Oh yeah, I do have Space Harrier.

743
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Welcome to fantasy zone.

744
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Get ready.

745
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
40 bucks.

746
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
According to the price tag.

747
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
When it was new.

748
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Pac-Land.

749
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Ys one and two.

750
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Here's my Japanese games.

751
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Twinbee.

752
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Some weird bizarre shooter called Eldis.

753
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Uh.

754
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Garud and Tetsu 2.

755
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Which is Fatal Fury.

756
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Yeah, it's just Fatal Fury, right?

757
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Puyo Puyo.

758
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Puyo Puyo.

759
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Uh, uh, Strider, which we actually cannot play this game.

760
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Why's that?

761
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Well, it's sealed.

762
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
That might be one reason why you can't play it.

763
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Oh, it's not sealed.

764
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
It's just.

765
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Oh, it looks like it.

766
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
And sticky paper.

767
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Oh.

768
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Um, because we do not have, um, a system that we can use an arcade card in.

769
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:21,000
The, um, the one system that I really want, and listeners, if you want to band together

770
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:27,000
and do this for me, I'll be your best friend forever, um, I'm really trying to get a duo

771
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:33,000
RX, because it has the arcade card built into it, um, they're, they're about 150 bucks.

772
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
I mean, you can get them pretty affordable still.

773
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:45,000
But, um, I can't use an arcade card on my American Turbo Duo because the pin, the pins

774
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
are wrong.

775
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Remember I needed the, the, uh, converter.

776
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
And the converters are highly unreliable.

777
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:56,000
So, it's one game that we have, and Dan, Dan loves Strider more than anything.

778
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:01,000
The first website that he and I made together was his Strider Zone.

779
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
You guys made websites together?

780
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
That's so adorable.

781
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Back on AOL.

782
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Alan, why are we making websites together?

783
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
It's so precious.

784
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,000
It's called Neo, and I want to know if anyone remembers this.

785
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
He's just shaking his head at me, like shut up.

786
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
I want to know if anyone remembers this.

787
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
It was called Neo Strider Strider Zone.

788
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
And I touched up all of his graphics.

789
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:24,000
When I was a junior in high school, I had a Sailor Venus fan page on GeoCities.

790
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
You fag.

791
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Yes.

792
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Hey, my first cosplay was Sailor Venus.

793
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
She's the best one.

794
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
That's awesome.

795
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
And then there's this.

796
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Ooh.

797
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Ah.

798
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Miranda of Blood.

799
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
It's the holy grail of the, uh, Castlevania.

800
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Would you like to touch it?

801
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Yes.

802
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
I'm surprised you don't have this, like, you know.

803
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Shoot, we play it.

804
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Framed with, like, laser beams that, like, just cut you, like, the Resident Evil movie

805
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
when you try to touch it.

806
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Or, like, Catherine Zeta-Jones in Entrapment trying to go through the laser beams.

807
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
I used to be able to, to know, this is all I, the only thing I can read on this is die

808
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
something custom.

809
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
It's a tank game.

810
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,000
So the, the port that just came out on the Wii, does it look like this or is it different?

811
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
I haven't tried it on the Wii yet.

812
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
We haven't got it.

813
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
I haven't bought it either.

814
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Yeah.

815
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,000
I, I just, that's, all I know of those is die.

816
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
So anyway.

817
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Die!

818
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
No.

819
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Yeah.

820
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,000
I see, I see anime girlies on that one.

821
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Yeah.

822
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
That one right there.

823
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Yeah.

824
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
This is, um, Valis III.

825
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
And then, yeah, the rest of these are PlayStation.

826
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Tempest X.

827
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,000
I think we got a, these, these characters look familiar.

828
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
I think we got an American version of this at some point.

829
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Yeah, we did.

830
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Those are the NAMCO games on PlayStation that were all the Namco stuff.

831
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
And then wasn't there, like, a trademark symbol game that's really rare?

832
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
In Japan.

833
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Yeah.

834
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
It's a restricted symbol.

835
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
And someone is supposed to be getting it for me.

836
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Nice.

837
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
What's in it that's so special?

838
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
I don't remember.

839
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
But this one was really hard.

840
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Just won it.

841
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
This one was, I wanted all of them.

842
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
This one was really hard to find, too.

843
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,000
The O, um, that has Legend of the Valkyrie in it.

844
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Which is such a cute little fun game.

845
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
And here's, we, we've got, yeah, we've got all five of them.

846
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Of the US ones.

847
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
So, the first one.

848
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Wow.

849
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
It took us forever to get all of them.

850
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Trust me.

851
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:14,000
So the first one is Pac-Man, Galaga, Pole Position, Bosconian, Rally X, New Rally X,

852
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
and Toy Pop.

853
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Then Xevious, um, Grappler, Super Pac-Man.

854
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
This was the one that was the hardest to find, was the A.

855
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Because I wanted Super Pac-Man.

856
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Mappy, Grobda, and Dragon Buster.

857
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
You know we covered that story?

858
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
That said, oh, Grobda, we're gonna get it remixed.

859
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
I'm like, dude, it already came out in the US, so.

860
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Uh, and you could play this on the PS3.

861
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Because they were playing PS1 games, right?

862
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
We had to get M as the greatest hits.

863
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Uh-huh.

864
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Which sucks.

865
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Because of Ms. Pac-Man, I'm sure.

866
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
And Dig Dug.

867
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Galaxian, Ms. Pac-Man, Pole Position 2, Dig Dug, Phazon, and, uh, the Tower of Druaga.

868
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
But you could play that on a PS3 right now if you wanted to, right?

869
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Well, this was back in the day on PlayStation.

870
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Sure, sure.

871
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Then C was Assault, Pac-Land, Ordain, The Return of Ishtar, the Genji and Heike Clans.

872
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Wow.

873
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:04,000
And then Motocross, Baraduke, Dragon Spirit, Pac-Mania, and Legend of Valkyrie.

874
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Wow.

875
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:15,000
I just remember Assault from the arcade, the tank game, where you get to certain paths and you fly up in the air and you can fire your missiles a long way.

876
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
That was a fun game.

877
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:25,000
So let me ask one more, like, reminiscy type of question about games, and then maybe we'll take another quick break and move back into the studio and do more stories.

878
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Because we actually have a lot of stories still to talk about.

879
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Um, clearly we're all, like, game nerds of a certain caliber.

880
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
No.

881
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
We wouldn't do this show, right?

882
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,000
What do you think, and this is really a question for everybody, so Alan, I hope you're listening too.

883
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
I know you can hear us in the studio.

884
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Um, we get a yep from the other room.

885
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:47,000
What, um, why is it, what do you think made you such a gaming fan?

886
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Like, why do you think you play video games and you love the games and the gaming culture, like, so much?

887
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
I practically grew up with it.

888
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:02,000
I mean, seriously, I remember playing the Atari 2600 when I was a little kid.

889
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Um, I remember the Odyssey.

890
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:12,000
You know, I, it's just always been there, and it's always been a fun and kind of integral part of my life.

891
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
I hope that doesn't sound too sad.

892
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
But it's just always been there.

893
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
And...

894
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
I don't think it's sad because my story is somewhat similar.

895
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:25,000
I didn't like to go outside that much because I had asthma and allergies and everything, and that, and I hated everybody.

896
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
So, no I didn't.

897
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:33,000
But it was, it was my form of escape, and you know, my mom would play Nintendo with me.

898
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
She'd play the Nintendo.

899
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:42,000
And then when she was asking me for Christmas one time what to get my brothers, Genesis or Super Nintendo, I told her Super Nintendo, and then I played it the whole time.

900
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:47,000
So, but I mean, it's always been kind of, it's been sort of a bonding thing in my family a little bit.

901
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:58,000
And, and then when I was living in Alabama and playing games, I could play some things over the dial-up connection with friends in California.

902
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:06,000
And, you know, it just was my way of kind of getting out of how crappy Alabama was to live in.

903
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,000
I mean, at the time. I don't think Alabama's crappy, don't get me wrong.

904
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,000
I love my home state, but I never want to live there again.

905
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:20,000
I just did not like being stuck with everyone expecting me to be one way when I was clearly something other than what they wanted me to be.

906
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:28,000
So I would just play games all the time and kind of forget about it, and then it instead expanded my life.

907
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,000
I met my husband because I loved anime and video games.

908
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,000
I moved out here, we have a happy life. I have a whole bunch of Transformers.

909
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:43,000
So, I mean, it was, it's really, I think it's opened some doors in my otherwise lack of a social life.

910
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:48,000
And now I think I'm a lot more social than I used to be, and I would say video games have a big part of it.

911
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:55,000
I wouldn't say that, I don't know if it was like a social thing, because I would like to think I was still like kind of social when I was a kid.

912
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:01,000
You know, I have friends and all that stuff, but I think like growing up especially, I was, you know, my brother and sister were so much older than I was.

913
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:07,000
My brother is 14 years older, my sister is 16 years older than I am, and my parents then are quite a bit older.

914
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
My mom was 37 when she had me.

915
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:17,000
So by the time I was around, not only did I have kind of the only child syndrome thing going on, but my parents had kind of done it all with my brother and sister.

916
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,000
You know, they didn't want to do the camping thing or the, you know, a lot of the trips.

917
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,000
And not to say they didn't try to do that, because they did.

918
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
But let's face it, they were just getting older.

919
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,000
So I a lot of times just kind of had to entertain myself.

920
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:39,000
And I remember the day we got a Commodore 64 for Christmas, and I actually would play, the family got one for Christmas, and I would actually play that thing.

921
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:48,000
We hooked it up, and I remember like writing one of the programs in the book and running it, and it was like so awesome to know that like something I had done had made this like program.

922
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:53,000
And so I think the Commodore 64 kind of enabled me to gaming, even though we had an Atari 2600 that I played and all that other stuff.

923
00:44:53,000 --> 00:45:02,000
But I just found myself like I was really able to entertain myself by like writing these little programs or typing them in for magazines and therefore feeling accomplished.

924
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:08,000
And, you know, trying to get these accomplishments in games and so forth, and the games were sort of something I was able to get into.

925
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:14,000
And I felt like it was something I was kind of good at, and that I was able to kind of like follow the scene. Sorry, I'm just stretching.

926
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
I was able to like follow the scene pretty good.

927
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:23,000
And whereas like a lot of kids were really good at football or baseball or sports and things that I wasn't so good at, I was good at games.

928
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:27,000
And I could kick their butt in any like video game, and that was always like kind of cool.

929
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
And I think that's kind of what like enabled me into video games.

930
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
And of course I was a big band nerd in high school.

931
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Me too.

932
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:39,000
So that I think was part of the reason why I got into the music games when they came out, and especially like Busta.

933
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Now here in America it was Busta Groove, right?

934
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
No, Busta Move.

935
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
It was Busta Move in America.

936
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,000
No, in Japan it was Busta Move, in the U.S. it was Busta Groove.

937
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Right. So it was Busta Groove that actually got me into games, in the music games.

938
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:55,000
And I know Jamie hates that because that's not what they were called, really.

939
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:00,000
But I didn't know any better, being somebody who didn't really follow the import gaming.

940
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
It was funny to laugh about it.

941
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:07,000
So we're trying to get the mics untangled as we move back to the studio.

942
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
We're playing mic roulette here.

943
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Yep.

944
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
But that's how I-

945
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Shutting the door on the vault.

946
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
There you go. That's how I kind of got into music games.

947
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,000
And then DDR was like awesome. It was like the best thing I'd ever seen at that point.

948
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:21,000
The ditter was great.

949
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,000
All right. So we're retaking seats here.

950
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
You want to take this, Alan?

951
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
My butt was going to sleep on that floor.

952
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Yes. But I hope you guys enjoyed our little stories from the vault.

953
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,000
If you guys want to ask us some questions and chat, chat.orangelandtrady.com.

954
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Any types of like follow up or what have you.

955
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,000
I'm finally able to look at chat here again.

956
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,000
And let's see. We should be, by the way, the G line should be up.

957
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
I'm trying.

958
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
So you should be able to get back in. So let me know if you have success.

959
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Let's see.

960
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Blaze in our chat room says, my mom used to whip my butt in Donkey Kong Country on the Super Nintendo.

961
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,000
See, my parents were never like really into games at all.

962
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Like, I don't know. My dad, I think would try, but he just, I don't think he was really into it.

963
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Like you'd rather just take me mini golfing or something.

964
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
And then I'd want to play games the whole time we were there.

965
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
I wouldn't want to really golf.

966
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Let's see.

967
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Toygak says Bust A Move is a game in the US.

968
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Yeah, that was the whole problem. It was Bust A Move was Puzzle Bobble.

969
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Yep. Which I think Puzzle Bobble is much cuter.

970
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Yeah, it is. So, all right.

971
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,000
So I think we're going to take, let's take like a quick, quick break.

972
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:32,000
And when we come back, we'll do some more news stories that we have listed and some of the other chat topics we have.

973
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Okay.

974
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Does that sound good? And we got to think about what we're going to do for food too.

975
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
I think we're going to do a take and bake.

976
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Right. What time do those places close?

977
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Like nine?

978
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Yeah.

979
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
No, tonight?

980
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Papa Murphy's? They're like seven, right?

981
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Well, then we should go, oh.

982
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Yeah, right?

983
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Yeah.

984
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Well, there used to be one near me before they closed and they were always eight or nine o'clock.

985
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Okay.

986
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Yeah.

987
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
We'll call one and find out during this break.

988
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Okay.

989
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
So we're going to take a quick break while I figure out the food situation.

990
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Then we're going to come back.

991
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:01,000
We're either going to do stories or if I have to run and get food, I don't know what you guys are going to talk about.

992
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
You'll think of something.

993
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
We'll talk about you.

994
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Classic game I could do.

995
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Or does that come later?

996
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
That's come later during the stories.

997
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Okay.

998
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
We'll worry about that.

999
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
But you can talk about PC games or something.

1000
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
I don't know.

1001
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Or just field questions from chat the whole time.

1002
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
I don't know.

1003
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
We'll figure something out.

1004
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
We should do an ask, let's ask Orange Lounge when we come back.

1005
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
All right.

1006
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Well, we'll see.

1007
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
We're going to talk about dinner and all that stuff.

1008
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:23,000
So we will be right back with more of the Orange Lounge Radio Marathon right after a quick break.

1009
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,000
We are live at All Games Radio.

1010
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:33,000
We'll be right back.

1011
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

1012
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:40,000
We are taping our marathon live at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.

1013
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:48,000
It is Saturday, I want to say October, September 5th of 2010 at 642 p.m.

1014
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,000
And it is, we've been on the air since what, about 2 o'clock?

1015
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Something like that.

1016
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
But just a little bit after 2.

1017
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:59,000
So we're on our, about four and a half hours in of our show tonight.

1018
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
We had our main show earlier.

1019
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,000
If you're tuning in expecting to hear Loki and the usual bits and all that,

1020
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,000
that started at 2 and finished at like 5.30.

1021
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
So we're kind of in the extra stuff now.

1022
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,000
We're broadcasting all night long because we can.

1023
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
It looks like a lot of you guys are joining us.

1024
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,000
I'm looking at our chat room at chat.orangelaunchradio.com,

1025
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,000
which, yay, we're back in after all this time.

1026
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Thank you guys.

1027
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
And Rama keeps having to remind me it's Sunday.

1028
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Did I say it's Saturday?

1029
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Yeah, my bad.

1030
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
I just, I don't know why.

1031
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
I just really want it to be Saturday.

1032
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Because you have tomorrow off work.

1033
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
I know, because I have tomorrow off work.

1034
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
That's part of it too.

1035
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,000
So it doesn't like feel like Sunday because usually I'm having to get in that mode of,

1036
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,000
I got to go back to work tomorrow.

1037
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
So that's actually what I say too.

1038
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Better go to bed and work tomorrow.

1039
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:46,000
So we're back in the studio and we've got food figured out.

1040
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,000
We're going to do that during the next break because they don't close as early as I thought they did.

1041
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Dark Soccer actually made a phone call.

1042
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
That's good to know.

1043
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
I like that.

1044
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
So we're doing what, pizza tonight?

1045
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Yes.

1046
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Good.

1047
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
The food of gamers.

1048
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
That's right.

1049
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
The food of gamers and the food of marathons actually.

1050
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
All things considered.

1051
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
All right.

1052
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Hopefully Dark Soccer got this.

1053
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
I sent out a second show roll full of other stories.

1054
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Hopefully you saw that in your email.

1055
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
That would be a good question.

1056
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Let me see.

1057
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Okay.

1058
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Take a look.

1059
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Because we're going to do some more stories for you guys.

1060
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Some things that actually missed the show roll originally.

1061
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
We'll talk about those.

1062
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
And then we've got more classic games of the week coming up.

1063
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:27,000
And take some of your Facebook questions in the segment as well.

1064
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:31,000
They're going to do Ask Orange Lounge I think while I'm gone in the next segment.

1065
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
And some other stuff too.

1066
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,000
And oops.

1067
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Hey.

1068
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
How about some more DDR music?

1069
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Woo.

1070
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
I think we heard enough of that during the break.

1071
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Sorry about that guys.

1072
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
I think I only got one.

1073
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
No.

1074
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
I know.

1075
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
I sent you one.

1076
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Take a look.

1077
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Oh.

1078
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
No.

1079
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
It.

1080
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Because it.

1081
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Compressed.

1082
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
There it is.

1083
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
That's it.

1084
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
That's it.

1085
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Open up the attachment.

1086
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,000
No.

1087
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
No.

1088
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Open up the attachment.

1089
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Down.

1090
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Down.

1091
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Supplement.

1092
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Yay.

1093
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Okay.

1094
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,000
It's ugly but it works.

1095
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Alright.

1096
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:11,000
And also if you want to send us comments or whatever.

1097
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Chat along with us.

1098
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Chat.orangeloungeradio.com is the place to be.

1099
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:18,000
So happy we found our way back in the chat.

1100
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Alright.

1101
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
So Dark Sakura.

1102
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Well.

1103
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
For firsties.

1104
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
For people who love Sonic Adventure.

1105
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Like me.

1106
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:32,000
On Xbox Live Arcade it will be $10 as of September 15th.

1107
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,000
And that's really really sweet.

1108
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Sonic Adventure is probably one of my.

1109
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,000
In fact the only probably good one of the three.

1110
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
You know.

1111
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
3D ones.

1112
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,000
So I have to say that's pretty sweet.

1113
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
And.

1114
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Apparently.

1115
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:51,000
I just think this is funny and I want to read this from the article.

1116
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Because I snickered just now.

1117
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
It's like.

1118
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,000
We've contacted Sega to find out if the game will arrive on PSN on a similar timetable.

1119
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
We also sent them an email with the subject line.

1120
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Give us C-man.

1121
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:08,000
Followed by a body of text which essentially read C-man.

1122
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
So.

1123
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Are you going to be downloading this to check out and play?

1124
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Or are you like.

1125
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Screw this I have the original.

1126
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Screw this game.

1127
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
I'm kind of screw this I have the original.

1128
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Yeah.

1129
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
But at the same time I would like to support it.

1130
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,000
I sank so many hours into Sonic Adventure 2 for the Dreamcast.

1131
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:26,000
And that's the one that had the little Tamagotchi Pokemon where you had your little babies.

1132
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
The Sonic Adventure had them too.

1133
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Okay.

1134
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
The Chao.

1135
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Yeah.

1136
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
I sank about 30 hours into those things.

1137
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Because you have to like.

1138
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
I don't know.

1139
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Breed them and they have the little bat wings or the little things you can get on them.

1140
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
And you play with them on your VMUs.

1141
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
On the VMU.

1142
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
And I finally was like.

1143
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,000
This is not the best game and I don't know what I'm doing.

1144
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
So I stopped playing it.

1145
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,000
No.

1146
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Imagine trying to play them in Japanese.

1147
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Aw that's kind of sad though that you stopped playing after all that.

1148
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Well my first Dreamcast was Japanese.

1149
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
And we had Sonic Adventure.

1150
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,000
So trying to make myself read it.

1151
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:08,000
It was fun but yeah.

1152
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
Alright.

1153
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Well another story for you guys about Xbox Live Arcade.

1154
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Aw crap.

1155
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,000
I linked myself to the wrong story didn't I?

1156
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Son of a gun.

1157
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
You need to talk more Sonic Adventure.

1158
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,000
I lost my story.

1159
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Okay.

1160
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,000
What was your favorite level in Sonic Adventure?

1161
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Running from the semi-truck.

1162
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
That was Sonic.

1163
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Yeah Sonic Adventure 2.

1164
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
That was it.

1165
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,000
And then also that's the same semi-truck that is in the beginning of Bayonetta.

1166
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Really?

1167
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Yeah.

1168
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Cool.

1169
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Actually I love in Sonic Adventure it's the Sky Highway.

1170
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Or the Speed Highway.

1171
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Isn't Bayonetta full of all sorts of those types of inside jokes?

1172
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Yeah.

1173
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Would it say yeah?

1174
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Alright.

1175
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,000
I got my story.

1176
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Yay.

1177
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
This has to do with Trejar.

1178
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
And I'm sure Dark Cycle will be very happy about this Trejar story.

1179
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
It is a puzzle shooter.

1180
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
You might know it.

1181
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Bangayo.

1182
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Bangayo HD is coming out for Xbox Live Arcade.

1183
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:08,000
It's Bangayo HD Missile Fury coming out for Xbox Live Arcade.

1184
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,000
This game originally was on the Nintendo 64 and the Dreamcast.

1185
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,000
But now it's being revamped and redone.

1186
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:19,000
It was done before on the DS but DS is in your pocket.

1187
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
This is on the TV.

1188
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,000
It's on the big screen where everybody can see it.

1189
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:29,000
So yeah there's going to be giant robots and lights and fruit and all that stuff that Bangayo

1190
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
is famous for.

1191
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,000
You can break out into a sweat trying to dodge 5,000 bullets in 1080p.

1192
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Yes.

1193
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
And that's what Bangayo is all about.

1194
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:42,000
My question is though, if Bangayo is going HD and all this, see it's horizontal.

1195
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Wasn't Bangayo another vertical shooter?

1196
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Those don't translate too well into the HD because it's the wrong proportion.

1197
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Unless you were able to turn your HDTV like on its side, then it might work a lot better.

1198
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,000
I don't know.

1199
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Well they'll just have borders on the side like the final fight.

1200
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
It always looks weird.

1201
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
It always looks so weird.

1202
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Because that's like half the screen with those games.

1203
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Yeah to make them, well try playing, well some games though like I remember Galactic Attack

1204
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:14,000
had a scrolling screen where you could scroll from side to side and it was just shorter

1205
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
and maintain your proportion.

1206
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Alright.

1207
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,000
By the way, this is the other cool thing about the game.

1208
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,000
It's got 100 levels in the game so lots to play through.

1209
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
But guess what?

1210
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:30,000
If you finish all 100 levels and you decide, gosh I need something new to play, use the level editor.

1211
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:35,000
You're going to get to build your own levels and share them on Xbox Live.

1212
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
That sounds like fun.

1213
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
There you go.

1214
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Bongai is a fun game.

1215
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,000
So all this Dreamcast revival, good times.

1216
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Very good times.

1217
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
It's full of happiness.

1218
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Well in other news, there is a game called Aero Cross High Air, the OFLC, the Australian rating thing.

1219
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,000
It's one put out by Namco Bondi.

1220
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:08,000
And it's actually the German USK rated Metro Cross High Air GP.

1221
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:16,000
So looking this over, they're actually related from what I can tell.

1222
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Sorry I was looking this over.

1223
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
No you have to remember the stories in this segment.

1224
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:30,000
We didn't really prep in advance at all so it's going to be a little bit jankier than usual.

1225
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
But it's live radio, what can you do?

1226
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Well it's saying that Metro Cross is supposed to be like a redo of that 1985 Metro Cross that Namco put out.

1227
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Which is a side-scrolling foot race and you avoid giant soda cans.

1228
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,000
But what's Aero Cross?

1229
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Those soda cans are as big as that guy's torso.

1230
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Those are huge.

1231
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:54,000
In fact the soda cans actually are as big as him, I believe.

1232
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Yeah.

1233
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Rob, can you jump over soda cans that are your size?

1234
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Um, probably not.

1235
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
They look vaguely like Coke too.

1236
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Oh crap!

1237
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Wait, we're not to that story.

1238
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:10,000
I know, I know.

1239
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Completely random thing, I want to go to our chatroom, chat.orangetownsready.com.

1240
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:17,000
This is completely random and not on the show world but whatever, we have time to kill the night.

1241
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Robert M. is in chat and says, does iTunes still have the iMix user playlist or is that part of Ping now?

1242
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
And why does that make me think of Bing?

1243
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:30,000
One thing that Loki didn't mention during the show when he was talking about the iPhone and all those upgrades

1244
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:35,000
is that Apple also announced their big new social network this week called Ping.

1245
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Has anyone been using Ping?

1246
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Alan, have you used Ping?

1247
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:43,000
I'm on it. I added you and your former housemate.

1248
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
And I haven't touched it since.

1249
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:51,000
And my understanding is that it doesn't really aggregate data for you unless you're willing to buy music

1250
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:56,000
because then it tracks your purchases or review albums and I do neither of those on iTunes.

1251
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
So I have no idea what it's going to offer me.

1252
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:04,000
I was thinking at first like the way they were demoing it, I thought Ping was going to be this like awesome replacement for Facebook

1253
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:11,000
because it would be like Facebook but music oriented and then like no Farmville or any of those games that are on Facebook.

1254
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:16,000
And don't get me wrong, there's a time and a place for Farmville and Family Feud and Price is Right and all those Facebook games

1255
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
but sometimes you don't want all that bullshit.

1256
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:25,000
And I was also thinking that like, oh, when they showed Ping, they showed that Lady Gaga was like one of the first people they got obviously

1257
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:29,000
because she's like queen bitch right now, you got to have her for everything.

1258
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:35,000
And one of the things they showed is that she posted a little video that looked like it was taped on an iPhone 4.

1259
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:38,000
But that's not like an option in there for the users to use.

1260
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
Like I don't know if that's something they're building in soon or what.

1261
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
So it's like I don't understand the point of Ping.

1262
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:47,000
You can't even write your own status update unless you're Lady Gaga or one of the like famous people on there.

1263
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:53,000
So it's like you can use it to follow famous people and then like see what songs your friends are buying and make its own top ten list.

1264
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:56,000
But otherwise it's kind of like what's the point? I don't get it.

1265
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:02,000
I'm sure that either her or her label is being, I mean when she recommends an artist I'm sure it's really from her.

1266
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:09,000
But if you buy it through the iTunes store, someone's making money for that referral for all the Gaga stans that buy what she says to buy.

1267
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:16,000
I was hoping it was going to be something like Last.fm where you just play your iTunes, put it on shuffle, it'll track what you listen to.

1268
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Yeah I thought it was going to be Last.fm Killer.

1269
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
And recommend music for you.

1270
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
And have like a Facebook-y type thing integrated into it.

1271
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Yeah.

1272
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:33,000
But no. It's none of that. It's just, hey here's all the shit your friends are buying so you can like make fun of them when they buy Spice Girls Greatest Hits.

1273
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Although you really should make fun of that guy because that's probably me and you know what? Stop hating.

1274
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Alright.

1275
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Let's see. Oh Jessica Harper's in our chat, our good buddy from Understadation Live.

1276
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Well that explains why she was at the Apple building a couple weeks back.

1277
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:52,000
That's true. When she was at San Jose she was visiting the Apple building.

1278
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Now we know why.

1279
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
She was getting her ping thing.

1280
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,000
Ding. Wing.

1281
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
Let's see.

1282
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Redertainment in chat says iTunes has had Genius Mixes for a while now.

1283
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:08,000
That's not a bad way to discover music, although it's your own music.

1284
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Like the Genius Mixes run off your own, at least as far as I've seen, it's your own music library.

1285
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:18,000
But it's like really cool. Like a lot of people I have fairly eclectic music tastes.

1286
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Like you know I have some Synth Pop for those days. I have some you know Alanis and you know Tori for my angsty lesbian days.

1287
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:30,000
I have a variety of music in my collection. But the Genius Playlist is a good way to kind of like separate it.

1288
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:34,000
Like I'll be like okay today I want to hear Tegan and Sarah and like everything that sounds like it.

1289
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:38,000
And it'll kind of come up with a pretty decent mix.

1290
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
So I don't know.

1291
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
Let's see.

1292
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Ifarted in chat. Yes that's their name. Ifarted says Sky secretly bought Milli Vanilli songs. Admit it lol.

1293
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:56,000
I'll admit it. I bought them back in 1990 or whenever they were like actually out.

1294
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,000
I think I had a single.

1295
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
That was 91 so we were like.

1296
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,000
I was in junior high.

1297
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:06,000
I was actually quoted in the junior high paper during the whole like debacle because they ran a story on it.

1298
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:12,000
And I said something like well if they just released the names of the guys who really did it I'd still buy their music.

1299
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
It's it's cool.

1300
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:18,000
It's a bit more difficult giving someone shit for their music purchases when they're 14.

1301
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:21,000
It's not impossible but you don't have as much cred.

1302
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Exactly exactly.

1303
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
But just just just let's let's throw it back here a little bit.

1304
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:31,000
You can all you can all thank the guy in chat that goes by Ifarted for this.

1305
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Just a little retro flashback for you guys.

1306
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Like in retrospect how obvious is their faking.

1307
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Like for real.

1308
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:53,000
These guys are supposed to have also had a good voice on their own.

1309
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:56,000
You know and they wanted to do their own stuff.

1310
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
I need to hear the chorus.

1311
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:08,000
They performed on an MTV spring break back when that was still going on and they actually used an actual LP for their lip sync and it skips.

1312
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
It was like an Ashley Simpson thing.

1313
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Yeah.

1314
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:16,000
So they were doing their choreography and the girl you know it's true was stuttering because I guess they couldn't afford a cassette.

1315
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:19,000
Nice.

1316
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:22,000
That's got to be slightly embarrassing.

1317
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,000
All right.

1318
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
So let's go back to some gaming news.

1319
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
I'm sorry I got to shut off the Milli Vanilli for now.

1320
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Rhetortainment in our chat room says I can't give a 14 year old shit.

1321
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Watch me.

1322
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,000
That's true.

1323
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:43,000
There's some little shits at like golf land sometimes and I'm like the fuck I can't tell this kid what to do when he's like 14 years old and like thinks he's all like a badass.

1324
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:53,000
It's like you know someday you're going to like be unemployed and hating life and fathering tons of babies and yeah I don't know.

1325
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:56,000
My mom will roll you down with her Range Rover if you don't stop.

1326
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,000
Exactly.

1327
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,000
All right.

1328
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Hey back to gaming news from Milli Vanilli to Mario.

1329
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Apparently Nintendo is actually going to be bringing Super Mario All Stars to the Nintendo Wii.

1330
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
That's an interesting rumor going around this week.

1331
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:15,000
It's coming out October 21st for about 30 bucks US or 2500 yen if you will.

1332
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:19,000
It is supposed to mark the 25th anniversary of Super Mario Brothers.

1333
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:26,000
This game first went on sale in Japan in September of 1985 and then of course it came out in North America a long time later.

1334
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
That was of course the original Mario Brothers.

1335
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:37,000
Now Mario All Stars came back in 93 and that was Mario, Mario 2, Mario 3 and the Lost Levels which was really Japanese Mario 2.

1336
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:45,000
And in their cartridge they got our Mario 2 is Mario USA even though it was really Doki Doki Panic and I've gone cross-eyed.

1337
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:55,000
Apparently the Wii reissue is going to have special packaging and there will be a little booklet and a CD of Mario music that will include stuff from the original game all the way to Mario Galaxy 2.

1338
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:59,000
But no word if there are extra Mario games included with this.

1339
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Here's something interesting I think a lot of the journalists that are republishing the story are overlooking.

1340
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:08,000
There were actually two Mario All Stars karts.

1341
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:14,000
There was Super Mario All Stars and then there was Mario All Stars plus Mario World.

1342
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Actually all came on one kart.

1343
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,000
It was a pack-in.

1344
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,000
I saw it in the vault.

1345
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:23,000
And then the Game Boy Advance got special reissues of each one.

1346
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,000
True, true.

1347
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Oh yeah the advanced, yeah.

1348
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:34,000
I think Mario Advance 2 is really Super Mario Bros. 3. They were out of order but they all got a GBA remake treatment.

1349
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,000
They were really well done.

1350
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:47,000
So I'm kind of curious are we just going to be getting the exact same Super Nintendo game like a virtual console game on disc is what this is starting to sound like.

1351
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Which is kind of ironic because most of these games are on virtual console.

1352
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:56,000
Although they have better graphics and the re-release.

1353
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Or if it's going to be the whole thing and Mario World.

1354
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Because Mario World was one of the best Mario games they did period, you know.

1355
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Mario World was relatively epic.

1356
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,000
Yes.

1357
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:09,000
Like we don't want you to use emulators but we'll sell you the ROM on a disc for 30 bucks.

1358
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
Exactly, exactly.

1359
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Or the virtual console you know buying all this.

1360
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:17,000
Let's see if I bought Mario, Mario 2, Mario 3 those are all 5 bucks a piece.

1361
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Lost levels came out so it's actually 20 bucks just to buy the virtual console releases.

1362
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:25,000
So you're paying 10 bucks for all the super dev graphics.

1363
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:28,000
And I guess you are getting a CD full of music whatever.

1364
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:33,000
It just seems like there ought to be a little bit more to this or some extra Mario games or something.

1365
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
I mean come on it's the Nintendo Wii.

1366
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
You have a lot of extra space to do stuff right?

1367
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:40,000
Watch it and not have classic controller support.

1368
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
Just because.

1369
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,000
You got to use the Wii stick sideways.

1370
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
Well if they put Mario World on it that won't work.

1371
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
Cause there were 4 buttons.

1372
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
You had the spinny jump and the...

1373
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:57,000
Let's see Y was run, B was jump, X was spinny jump and A was...

1374
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:00,000
I think also fireball or something.

1375
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
I don't think it did anything really.

1376
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
Anyhow.

1377
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Let's see moving on Dark Sakura.

1378
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
You were laughing at some pictures you brought up earlier.

1379
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
What's this all about?

1380
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:16,000
They're fantastically filthy. At least I think they are.

1381
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:21,000
It's these little additions that hook onto the Wii remote.

1382
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:24,000
They are put out by Mojo Wejo.

1383
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:27,000
And they are supposed to transform...

1384
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
Mojo Wejo!

1385
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
Well this is a quote.

1386
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:37,000
Able to transform the varying motions of the control into appropriate vibration signals.

1387
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:40,000
Oooh.

1388
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:43,000
They're vibrators.

1389
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:46,000
They are interesting looking vibrators.

1390
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
They're will-dos.

1391
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
They're wee-dildos.

1392
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:54,000
I have to show you chat room and I want to see what you think about this.

1393
01:06:54,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Would this be a turn on or a total buzzkill?

1394
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:05,000
One of them looks like something you would use to pick up radioactive material.

1395
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
Like it doesn't even really look like...

1396
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
What's that supposed to do? Like pinch things?

1397
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:12,000
No, I bet it's for fapping.

1398
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Oh wow.

1399
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Seriously, look at it.

1400
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
It would be an adjustable little clamp that goes around your...

1401
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:22,000
It's the claw.

1402
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:28,000
Is it adjustable sizes? Cause you know I need extra large.

1403
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,000
Why are you laughing?

1404
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:37,000
I just looked over and saw Ellen give you a sideways look.

1405
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:42,000
But at any rate, yeah. You know what though? One of these...

1406
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:47,000
I don't think that I find that attractive.

1407
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:51,000
Does it come with Purell?

1408
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:58,000
It just wouldn't... I don't think that a wiimote would give off enough oomph.

1409
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:01,000
Yeah, I don't know. What games are you going to be able to play with that?

1410
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,000
That's what I want to know.

1411
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:06,000
What's just some housewife with a big grin on her face flailing around the living room?

1412
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:10,000
What are you doing? Oh, I'm playing WarioWare.

1413
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:13,000
But your hands are free, yeah?

1414
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:17,000
I'm playing the ping pong ball shooting level.

1415
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:21,000
This is what it says on the Mojo Wejo website, okay?

1416
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:25,000
The device is attached to the accessory port on a Nintendo Wii remote control.

1417
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:30,000
The control is then connected to a Bluetooth enabled PC running Mojo Wejo software.

1418
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:34,000
Using the Mojo Wejo patent pending Motion 2 vibration technology,

1419
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:39,000
the device is able to transform the varying motions of the control into appropriate vibration signals

1420
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:43,000
and send them to another selected device in the same room or over the internet.

1421
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:46,000
Wii gaming console not required.

1422
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:49,000
Essentially turning your Wii remotes into shared remote controlled vibrators,

1423
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:53,000
aka Wii vibrator or Wii-Bator.

1424
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:56,000
That's from...

1425
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
It kind of reminds me of the original.

1426
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,000
There's a video.

1427
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,000
Oh wow.

1428
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,000
There's a video to this.

1429
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:04,000
Oh, hooray.

1430
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,000
Wait, I should play this over here so we can get the audio over the feed.

1431
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Yeah, you play it.

1432
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,000
I've got my sound turned off.

1433
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,000
Alright, that's okay.

1434
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:11,000
We're going to play this over the feed here.

1435
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Where am I going?

1436
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Oh, here? The link?

1437
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:17,000
Yeah, follow the link to SF Weekly.

1438
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:20,000
Got it, got it, got it.

1439
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
Okay.

1440
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
I don't know if this has sound.

1441
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:27,000
It's just kind of doing its thing.

1442
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
It's drawn a little like unhappy face.

1443
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
That's not really unhappy, that's the meh.

1444
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,000
And now it's like...

1445
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:33,000
And now it's very happy.

1446
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,000
I'm super happy.

1447
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Because I'm playing the Nintendo Wii,

1448
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:39,000
but I have this box that says Mojo Wiijo.

1449
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:44,000
And now my Wii has a little accessory that I shake.

1450
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
It's making a little shaky thing.

1451
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:49,000
And I'm waiting for something interesting to happen here.

1452
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,000
What's it doing?

1453
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
It's transmitting to the computer.

1454
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,000
It is.

1455
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:56,000
Then it's transmitting back to the Wii mode and it starts shaking.

1456
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
And now the eyes are turning all different colors.

1457
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
That is kind of scary.

1458
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,000
You know what it looks like?

1459
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:04,000
Well, from what I'm getting on here, it's so that you can...

1460
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,000
It's for cybering.

1461
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
It's for cyber sex.

1462
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:10,000
It runs off the Bluetooth in your computer.

1463
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,000
That's what it is.

1464
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:14,000
It's just using the Wii mode as like, hey, who doesn't have a Wii mode?

1465
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,000
So here's what you do.

1466
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,000
You get on your...

1467
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
I'm just explaining this like I know.

1468
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:25,000
You get on your PC and you find someone you want to do some naughty things with online.

1469
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
And then you take the Wii mode and put on the attachment.

1470
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:32,000
And, you know, attach it.

1471
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:38,000
And then you go on the chat room and you put like, oh, baby, I am so hot right now.

1472
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,000
Like, push the button.

1473
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:42,000
And then they push the button and you're like, ooh.

1474
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Instead of typing, I am having so much trouble typing right now, it would be like, you know,

1475
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:52,000
VRQ would be all scrambled.

1476
01:10:52,000 --> 01:11:02,000
Because, you know, and then you'd have to get one of the little plastic covers for your monitor.

1477
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:06,000
You remember when people always had the little plastic covers for their keyboard and everything?

1478
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
And we used to just call it the jizz guard.

1479
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,000
Yeah.

1480
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,000
Splash zone.

1481
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
Good times.

1482
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
Or you just play rez with it, honestly.

1483
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:17,000
That's really what that's made for.

1484
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:20,000
You have amused Tara with your explanation.

1485
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,000
Good.

1486
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:24,000
All right.

1487
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:32,000
Well, speaking of sensual video games, the Wii Balance Board is now supported in a massage game.

1488
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
Oh, you're going to love this, Dark Saga.

1489
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,000
Ooh.

1490
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
Called Love Press Plus Plus.

1491
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:40,000
This looks like the type of massage game that has happy endings.

1492
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:45,000
Not the type of massage you paid good money to go to school to learn.

1493
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:48,000
It's going to be shown off this month at the Tokyo Game Show 2010.

1494
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
It's a massage game called Love Press Press.

1495
01:11:50,000 --> 01:12:01,000
It's by Shirai Labs, and it uses massage recognition to stimulate the physical communication of lovers.

1496
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
Right.

1497
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:07,000
You choose a virtual partner, and you can pick from various shapes and ages.

1498
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Although I somehow doubt there's old fatties.

1499
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:17,000
The shapes are skinny and skinnier probably, and the ages are like young or 18.

1500
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,000
No gilfs.

1501
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:22,000
Because, like, real people don't ever be in these games.

1502
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
Let's see.

1503
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:30,000
Supposedly the game is not supposed to be sexual in nature, although the picture definitely doesn't give me that impression.

1504
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:38,000
The game is supposed to give off audio cues like, stop, where are you touching?

1505
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
Creepy.

1506
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,000
Wow.

1507
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,000
There's actually an announcement.

1508
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,000
You know what, Rob?

1509
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:46,000
There has to be one line in that game that's in every hentai.

1510
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:53,000
Look, here's this guy playing the game, and it just looks like he's having anal sex with a balance board is really what it looks like to me.

1511
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
I mean, tell me I'm wrong.

1512
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,000
No.

1513
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
But he's having anal sex with a balance board, and somehow that's massage.

1514
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
Let's link that in the chatroom and put it to a quick vote.

1515
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
Okay.

1516
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,000
Quick poll in our chatroom.

1517
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
Anal board sex, Y-N.

1518
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Go to the following link.

1519
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Is that man having wee board sex?

1520
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,000
Anal sex, hold on.

1521
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:15,000
Let me type that in bold.

1522
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:20,000
I have to vote too.

1523
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
Maybe the longer we broadcast, the dirtier we get.

1524
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,000
I don't know.

1525
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,000
I don't know.

1526
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:30,000
Some hospitals in Japan are going to get way more weird emergency room visits than they're used to due to this game.

1527
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:34,000
It pinches.

1528
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,000
But you see what he's doing?

1529
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:39,000
He's massaging the board like it's supposed to be somebody's back.

1530
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:40,000
Okay.

1531
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:46,000
Now, this actually goes to something which is a kind of a recent, and I've actually been reading sociological articles about this.

1532
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
That there's been this-

1533
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,000
About this?

1534
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,000
No, it has to do with it.

1535
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:51,000
Anal sex with wee balance boards?

1536
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,000
It has to do with it.

1537
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
You read a lot.

1538
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,000
Hi, it's me.

1539
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:58,000
If there's information to be learned, I learn it.

1540
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:08,000
But there's actually been this big, and they've been interviewing people who are becoming less and less outwardly social, preferring to stay at home more often,

1541
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:12,000
who basically don't want sex.

1542
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:16,000
I guess companionship, but not like with a real person.

1543
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
Like this one guy married his doll.

1544
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
Also the guy who married the DS, right?

1545
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
Oh, the one guy who married his DS.

1546
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
But it's been this social thing lately.

1547
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:40,000
Actually, well, I was reading, I was doing some, looking up some stuff about birth rates dropping, and they had that as a link in regards to birth rates dropping in Japan.

1548
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:45,000
And I was like, well, you know, isn't this just what we hear about, you know, kind of, you know, fringe behavior?

1549
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:46,000
It's not the norm.

1550
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:51,000
But apparently it's becoming either more of a trend or more of a public knowledge type thing.

1551
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:56,000
So this still totally doesn't surprise me.

1552
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:02,000
Sorry, I'm just looking at this because they actually put on here, they put tweet love press to give your comments.

1553
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
I'm trying to see what comments, but it's all-

1554
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,000
We have a new president, Kat.

1555
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,000
Hey, wait a minute.

1556
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:09,000
Like all the results are like more than two days old.

1557
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:10,000
What is this?

1558
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:14,000
We don't have enough, well, we don't have enough people tweeting love press.

1559
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:18,000
I think we need to change that.

1560
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:21,000
It looks like everybody has tweeted love press two days ago.

1561
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,000
Well, now we-

1562
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:29,000
And Redertainment, yes, I am very familiar with the term and I wasn't going to bring that up, but that's actually been, again, coming up.

1563
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:30,000
Asexuality.

1564
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,000
Yes.

1565
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:37,000
So I think you guys need to tweet about the love press and, you know, how you can't wait for the anal sex we balance board game.

1566
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:40,000
All right, the results of our quick poll are in.

1567
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,000
Here we go, let's see.

1568
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
Yes, I'm sorry, the quick poll again.

1569
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:46,000
Is that man giving anal sex to the balance board?

1570
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,000
Yes, he is.

1571
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:48,000
Yes.

1572
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:49,000
Yes.

1573
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:50,000
Yes.

1574
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:51,000
That's some butt sex right there.

1575
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:52,000
Yes.

1576
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,000
Yes.

1577
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,000
Frown.

1578
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,000
Oh, baby.

1579
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:56,000
Oh, baby.

1580
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:57,000
Yes.

1581
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:58,000
Sadly.

1582
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,000
Yes, he is.

1583
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:00,000
Guys goes blind on a scale of one to ten.

1584
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,000
I'm a fuck you now.

1585
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,000
He's friending the wheeze.

1586
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
You know, it looks like he's choking the person he's having sex with.

1587
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,000
Kind of.

1588
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:06,000
Yes.

1589
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,000
Yes.

1590
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,000
But he's raping it at the same time.

1591
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:09,000
Anal sex rape o'clock.

1592
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,000
There you go.

1593
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,000
Those are the results of the quick poll.

1594
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
But what if it's consensual?

1595
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:16,000
What if the the balance board is consensual?

1596
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,000
I don't know.

1597
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Then it's not rape.

1598
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,000
Again, you need to tweet.

1599
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:22,000
Right at the bottom of that page, it says tweet love press to give your comments.

1600
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:27,000
I would like our listeners to send their comments on the love press over to the makers of the game.

1601
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
They're waiting to hear your comments on love press.

1602
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:34,000
If you take a towel and wrap it up and press it down on there, does it then become a waterboarding simulator?

1603
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,000
I don't know.

1604
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
That's a good question.

1605
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:42,000
All right.

1606
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,000
So there you go.

1607
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,000
There's another sensual game.

1608
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,000
But it's not it's not real.

1609
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:46,000
It's not sexual.

1610
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:49,000
It's just, you know, going to teach you how to massage.

1611
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
You know, I hate the term happy ending, by the way.

1612
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:52,000
I know you do.

1613
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,000
Which is why I say it all the time.

1614
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:57,000
That is not I'm not going to I'm not going to get on my high horse about this.

1615
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:58,000
Is OK.

1616
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:59,000
Hold on.

1617
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:00,000
I have two questions.

1618
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:04,000
Is it something that would typically be done at the end of the session?

1619
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:05,000
Yes.

1620
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:08,000
Is it going to make the recipient happy?

1621
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,000
Yes.

1622
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
Therefore, it's a happy ending.

1623
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:18,000
I know it's all offensive and shit to massage people who, you know, take the art of massage very seriously.

1624
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:32,000
But, you know, on top of that, it's the other reason why we're running into all this legislation going around now, trying to put police officials on the board of massage therapists in California who have no nothing about it.

1625
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:40,000
As gamers, they're trying to say that M-rated games shouldn't be sold unless they have all these restrictions or games or porn and all this stuff.

1626
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,000
It's fun.

1627
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,000
Stick it to the man.

1628
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,000
That's right.

1629
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:49,000
Have you seen Dark Seeker, the YouTube where this masseuse is like, oh, would you like happy ending?

1630
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:50,000
And the guy says, yeah.

1631
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:54,000
And all of a sudden, like, balloons fall out of the sky and clowns come out.

1632
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:58,000
He's like in his towel clapping like, yay.

1633
01:17:58,000 --> 01:17:59,000
I should I should see that.

1634
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:02,000
That sounds now that's funny.

1635
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
That sounds entirely too amusing.

1636
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:05,000
Do you know how to find that?

1637
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
You know what I would look up?

1638
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:08,000
We got a marathon show.

1639
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,000
I can look up YouTube.

1640
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:10,000
It's fine.

1641
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,000
Happy ending parody.

1642
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
I don't know.

1643
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:16,000
I could probably tell what it is from the cap.

1644
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,000
No.

1645
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,000
Oh, this one.

1646
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,000
Happy ending.

1647
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:20,000
Massage HD.

1648
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:21,000
Uncut original version.

1649
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:22,000
Is that it?

1650
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:25,000
This girl's got big titties.

1651
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,000
Now I want to just see this one.

1652
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
I don't know.

1653
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Just going to meet that a little bit.

1654
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
Oh, this is like soft core right here.

1655
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:37,000
That's hot.

1656
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
Dang.

1657
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
This is awesome radio, by the way.

1658
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:44,000
I just want to say that's because we're amazing people.

1659
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,000
Orange.

1660
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,000
Oh, no, it is.

1661
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:47,000
This is it.

1662
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:48,000
This is it.

1663
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:49,000
Orange lunch.

1664
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:50,000
Cinemax.

1665
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:51,000
Okay.

1666
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,000
Hold on.

1667
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:53,000
Hold on.

1668
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:54,000
You have to watch the star.

1669
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
Look at that massage.

1670
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
Look at that.

1671
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Uh, is that the type of outfit you wear when giving massages?

1672
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:10,000
No, I'm a fan of sweat pants and a t-shirt.

1673
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
There's a sign therapeutic massages only.

1674
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:15,000
No police allowed.

1675
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:26,000
This sounds like every Chinese restaurant in America, by the way.

1676
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,000
Right?

1677
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:28,000
I know.

1678
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:35,000
I think they all have the same CD or there's like, okay, forget it.

1679
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:42,000
Do you want happy ending?

1680
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:46,000
You have a dollar.

1681
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:47,000
Okay.

1682
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:48,000
Okay.

1683
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,000
Happy ending.

1684
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:54,000
Hahahahaha.

1685
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:08,000
Hahahahaha.

1686
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
Huh, you happy now?

1687
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:13,000
Well it really wasn't what I was hoping for.

1688
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
Oh no....

1689
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:18,960
Oh, maybe you want a hand job.

1690
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:20,800
$50.

1691
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:23,520
For a hand job, right?

1692
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:26,520
Yeah, hand job.

1693
01:20:26,520 --> 01:20:28,160
Yeah, OK.

1694
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:30,760
OK.

1695
01:20:30,760 --> 01:20:31,320
Hand job!

1696
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:40,040
And they're all in Greece outfits.

1697
01:20:40,040 --> 01:20:42,200
That's fantastic.

1698
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:45,360
He's doing it, too.

1699
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:47,800
Hand job, hand job, hand job, hand job, hand job, hand job.

1700
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:49,720
That was amazing.

1701
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:53,240
Thank you, Alan, for bringing that into my life.

1702
01:20:53,240 --> 01:20:54,080
I like that in chat.

1703
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:56,320
Oh, chat room, how you have missed out.

1704
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:58,000
For those listening on the podcast,

1705
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:01,320
YouTube user is Mediocre Films.

1706
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:02,760
There it is, Mediocre Films.

1707
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:05,640
And it's called Happy Ending Massage.

1708
01:21:05,640 --> 01:21:07,840
It was brilliant.

1709
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:09,320
Love that.

1710
01:21:09,320 --> 01:21:11,040
Oh, hey, video game news.

1711
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:13,080
Once in a while here on the Orange Lounge Radio.

1712
01:21:13,080 --> 01:21:15,120
Dark Sakura, got anything for us?

1713
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:17,800
Oh, yes, not yet.

1714
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:23,360
OK, well, Kirby's Epic Yarn, OK, they're

1715
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:27,160
saying there's a video, a commercial, that

1716
01:21:27,160 --> 01:21:32,280
was an inspiration for Kirby's Epic Yarn.

1717
01:21:32,280 --> 01:21:37,600
I'm trying to look at a stop motion movie.

1718
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:38,920
OK, this I've got to see.

1719
01:21:38,920 --> 01:21:41,480
And yeah, we haven't rehearsed any of this.

1720
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:44,600
So I'm trying to see what this was.

1721
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:46,160
It's OK, we got lots of time to kill it.

1722
01:21:46,160 --> 01:21:49,240
It's a stop motion animation of somebody doing Kirby's Adventure

1723
01:21:49,240 --> 01:21:49,840
in yarn.

1724
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:54,440
I'm going to quote this.

1725
01:21:54,440 --> 01:21:59,760
OK, it came from, the original idea

1726
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:01,520
came from Steph at Good Feel, which

1727
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:04,760
was inspired by a stop animation film made primarily with yarn,

1728
01:22:04,760 --> 01:22:05,720
explains Ellis.

1729
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:07,480
I'm reading off Destructoid.

1730
01:22:07,480 --> 01:22:09,680
With the ability for players to interact with the game's

1731
01:22:09,680 --> 01:22:12,520
environment, such as unzipping the background panels,

1732
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:16,360
Kirby's Epic Yarn is really its own category as a platformer.

1733
01:22:16,360 --> 01:22:20,400
So they're saying that nobody at Nintendo of America

1734
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:21,360
knew what it came from.

1735
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:28,240
So I'm seeing if this is perhaps the, yeah,

1736
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:30,400
this was a stop motion animation commercial

1737
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:35,080
that came out in Japan for Kirby's Adventure.

1738
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:37,440
All done with yarn.

1739
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:39,760
Yarn style, that's kind of cool.

1740
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:41,320
It's really cute.

1741
01:22:41,320 --> 01:22:43,560
Isn't it amazing what the internet will unearth?

1742
01:22:43,560 --> 01:22:45,960
Like, if you have an unoriginal idea, at some point,

1743
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:47,280
the internet will find it.

1744
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:48,200
You know what I mean?

1745
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:49,160
Man, Kirby sure sucks.

1746
01:22:49,160 --> 01:22:50,920
He doesn't even realize it.

1747
01:22:50,920 --> 01:22:53,480
No, he does, though.

1748
01:22:53,480 --> 01:22:55,000
Aww.

1749
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,280
See, that's such a cute, why don't we get cute commercials

1750
01:22:57,280 --> 01:22:58,040
like that, Rob?

1751
01:22:58,040 --> 01:22:59,280
Explain it to me, please.

1752
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:00,880
You're not watching enough cartoons.

1753
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:01,640
That's what it is.

1754
01:23:01,640 --> 01:23:03,800
No, we don't have cool commercials anymore.

1755
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:06,240
How does a hipster play Kirby?

1756
01:23:06,240 --> 01:23:06,760
How?

1757
01:23:06,760 --> 01:23:08,480
Without inhaling any powers, because it's

1758
01:23:08,480 --> 01:23:11,160
a pure experience.

1759
01:23:11,160 --> 01:23:12,960
Uh-huh, huh, huh, huh.

1760
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:14,800
All right, do you want to do that story

1761
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:16,920
on the third night's game you skipped over?

1762
01:23:16,920 --> 01:23:17,440
I did.

1763
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:19,320
Did you, or did you do that one?

1764
01:23:19,320 --> 01:23:22,040
I opened everything up in order.

1765
01:23:22,040 --> 01:23:23,720
Did I link the same story twice?

1766
01:23:23,720 --> 01:23:24,920
Oh, crap.

1767
01:23:24,920 --> 01:23:26,920
No, I just linked the same thing twice.

1768
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:27,680
Sorry about that.

1769
01:23:27,680 --> 01:23:28,480
Skip that story, then.

1770
01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:29,240
I'll do these two.

1771
01:23:29,240 --> 01:23:30,520
Oh, so yeah.

1772
01:23:30,520 --> 01:23:31,520
Yeah, it's the wrong link.

1773
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:32,920
I screwed up, blah, blah, blah.

1774
01:23:32,920 --> 01:23:34,040
Well, thanks, Rob.

1775
01:23:34,040 --> 01:23:35,600
You're welcome.

1776
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:37,320
Well, now you've got to do two stories in a row.

1777
01:23:37,320 --> 01:23:38,120
Fine.

1778
01:23:38,120 --> 01:23:38,760
I'll do three.

1779
01:23:38,760 --> 01:23:39,240
Fine.

1780
01:23:39,240 --> 01:23:39,840
Fine, do it.

1781
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:40,440
I don't care.

1782
01:23:40,440 --> 01:23:46,800
007, a slew of pre-order items for GoldenEye 007 coming out

1783
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:47,640
on the Wii.

1784
01:23:47,640 --> 01:23:49,400
GameStop, if you get the game there,

1785
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:51,560
you're going to get invisibility mode

1786
01:23:51,560 --> 01:23:54,840
will be unlocked in the game for split screen multiplayer.

1787
01:23:54,840 --> 01:23:57,520
Each player will be invisible for a set amount of time,

1788
01:23:57,520 --> 01:23:59,680
allowing you to sneak up on each other.

1789
01:23:59,680 --> 01:24:01,720
If you go to Best Buy, you're going to get a tag

1790
01:24:01,720 --> 01:24:04,400
mode for split screen multiplayer.

1791
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:06,800
Apparently, if a tagged player gets tagged or whatever,

1792
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:09,600
you can't kill another player without first tagging someone

1793
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:10,440
else.

1794
01:24:10,440 --> 01:24:12,120
Now, Activision says that these codes

1795
01:24:12,120 --> 01:24:15,040
are exclusive until the end of the year,

1796
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:17,120
but then I don't know what happens with that.

1797
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:19,480
So maybe they're going to, I don't

1798
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:22,200
know if they're codes you put into the game, which will end

1799
01:24:22,200 --> 01:24:24,040
up on the internet everywhere, or if it's

1800
01:24:24,040 --> 01:24:26,480
some type of DLC, which doesn't make sense,

1801
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:28,600
because Nintendo Wii doesn't do a lot of DLC.

1802
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:29,960
Although, there's some.

1803
01:24:29,960 --> 01:24:33,560
Like, the Final Fantasy IV game has some DLC in it.

1804
01:24:33,560 --> 01:24:35,960
But yeah, that's strange.

1805
01:24:35,960 --> 01:24:37,920
Oh, by the way, if you get the game at Walmart,

1806
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:42,480
you get a t-shirt that says Cheater with an Odd Job hat.

1807
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:44,960
Now, that you can't get with a code, so I hate to say it,

1808
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:49,080
but Walmart seems to be the best place to get this game.

1809
01:24:49,080 --> 01:24:51,160
So there you go, a little Odd Job hat says Cheater.

1810
01:24:51,160 --> 01:24:54,400
Well, that's because anyone who uses Odd Job is a cheap bitch.

1811
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:57,240
No, Odd Job is awesome, and you just can't deal with it.

1812
01:24:57,240 --> 01:25:02,520
All right, by the way, one of the original developers

1813
01:25:02,520 --> 01:25:04,520
has some interesting things to say about this.

1814
01:25:04,520 --> 01:25:08,200
Martin Hollis, he was with Rare when the original GoldenEye

1815
01:25:08,200 --> 01:25:10,080
came out on the Nintendo 64.

1816
01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:13,080
He says, quote, I imagine it's a business decision, isn't it?

1817
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:15,720
This is an interview with an official Nintendo magazine.

1818
01:25:15,720 --> 01:25:16,920
This name is valuable.

1819
01:25:16,920 --> 01:25:17,760
Let's use it.

1820
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:20,280
I find it hard to picture Activision's top management

1821
01:25:20,280 --> 01:25:23,200
being excited about the original and wanting to do it justice.

1822
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:24,960
In fact, I find it hard to imagine them

1823
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:26,680
being excited about any game.

1824
01:25:26,680 --> 01:25:30,040
It's my perception that they are trying to be EA, only more so.

1825
01:25:30,040 --> 01:25:31,960
I think they're doing a fine job with that.

1826
01:25:34,840 --> 01:25:36,320
I know, right?

1827
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:38,560
He's a little irritated there.

1828
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:41,680
Now, he does say nice things about the developers themselves.

1829
01:25:41,680 --> 01:25:44,920
He says, quote, they are a good company.

1830
01:25:44,920 --> 01:25:48,400
I'm confident they've done their very best.

1831
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:53,040
So he's not letting his nastiness go over

1832
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:55,760
to the developers, but it's all about the money grabbers

1833
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:56,600
at Activision.

1834
01:25:56,600 --> 01:25:58,000
You know what's funny is that that's

1835
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,300
what hella people have been saying about Activision lately

1836
01:26:00,300 --> 01:26:00,800
anyway.

1837
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:04,720
So it's kind of funny that it came out that way.

1838
01:26:04,720 --> 01:26:05,560
So there you go.

1839
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:07,600
All right, I guess I have to do another story now

1840
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:11,520
because I couldn't link Dark Soccer's story, right?

1841
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:14,040
Hey, Oddworld, Stranger's Wrath.

1842
01:26:14,040 --> 01:26:18,240
It's a remake coming to PSN in 2011.

1843
01:26:18,240 --> 01:26:21,520
It's a first slash third person shooter that originally came out

1844
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:23,320
in 2005.

1845
01:26:23,320 --> 01:26:26,160
And you took on the role of the stranger.

1846
01:26:26,160 --> 01:26:28,520
But it was kind of like an Oddworld type of game.

1847
01:26:28,520 --> 01:26:33,480
You used ammo, animals, bugs, to actually take out enemies.

1848
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:35,960
It's going to have updated visuals to 720p,

1849
01:26:35,960 --> 01:26:39,240
updated graphics, updated music, and all that stuff.

1850
01:26:39,240 --> 01:26:43,680
The dialogue in the game is also being remastered.

1851
01:26:43,680 --> 01:26:49,520
Is this the, I remember the last Odyssey game that came out,

1852
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:52,840
where you're a cowboy, where you're actually a cow,

1853
01:26:52,840 --> 01:26:55,160
and you're shooting enemies first person shooter style.

1854
01:26:55,160 --> 01:26:56,880
And I remember it bombed horribly.

1855
01:26:56,880 --> 01:26:59,360
Is that what this is, remade?

1856
01:26:59,360 --> 01:27:01,080
But you're not a cow, I don't think.

1857
01:27:01,080 --> 01:27:02,320
No, it doesn't look like it.

1858
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:03,520
Like a moose or something?

1859
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:04,560
Someone in chattel knows.

1860
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:06,720
How is a cow like a moose?

1861
01:27:06,720 --> 01:27:11,760
Well, they're both big and stinky.

1862
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:12,520
All right.

1863
01:27:12,520 --> 01:27:14,880
Well, it's going to be 720p and all that good stuff.

1864
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:16,720
They are targeting an Easter release.

1865
01:27:16,720 --> 01:27:18,760
One other thing that they're putting in the game,

1866
01:27:18,760 --> 01:27:20,760
PlayStation Move support.

1867
01:27:20,760 --> 01:27:22,600
So it's almost like a whole different game

1868
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:23,720
from what it used to be.

1869
01:27:23,720 --> 01:27:27,000
Move with what Alan says.

1870
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:28,880
Shut up.

1871
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:30,840
I just can't.

1872
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:33,720
I can't stop.

1873
01:27:33,720 --> 01:27:36,160
I remember when Abe's Odyssey and Abe's Exodus

1874
01:27:36,160 --> 01:27:38,280
were going to be a part of this huge, like, seven

1875
01:27:38,280 --> 01:27:40,040
sequel sprawling epic.

1876
01:27:40,040 --> 01:27:42,440
And by, like, the fourth game, everyone

1877
01:27:42,440 --> 01:27:44,480
stopped caring about the storyline.

1878
01:27:44,480 --> 01:27:46,960
Robert Ammon Chat says, you're an alien bounty hunter,

1879
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:49,840
I think, is what's going on there.

1880
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:51,360
So there you go.

1881
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:55,000
Developer Just Add Water is making that whole game.

1882
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:56,720
It'll be fun, I'm sure.

1883
01:27:56,720 --> 01:27:58,400
I'm going to go check that out right now.

1884
01:27:58,400 --> 01:28:01,640
I'm pre-ordering it right now.

1885
01:28:01,640 --> 01:28:02,960
DarkSakura?

1886
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:06,560
Oh, I was just thinking about pizza.

1887
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:09,440
We'll take a break here in a minute and do the pizza stuff.

1888
01:28:09,440 --> 01:28:14,880
Well, as far as there's news for DJ Hero 2,

1889
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:19,280
the RZA is in the cast of DJ Hero 2,

1890
01:28:19,280 --> 01:28:23,040
as in dude from Wu-Tang Clan, who also likes

1891
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:26,640
to put out kung fu movies.

1892
01:28:26,640 --> 01:28:29,480
They've actually got images for his costume up here,

1893
01:28:29,480 --> 01:28:33,280
and I'm pulling those up to have a good look at them.

1894
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:34,480
Pretty cool.

1895
01:28:34,480 --> 01:28:37,560
Yeah, that's him being motion captured for the game,

1896
01:28:37,560 --> 01:28:38,880
so that's actually pretty cool.

1897
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:42,920
So yeah, fully digitized, going to be in the game.

1898
01:28:42,920 --> 01:28:48,840
And I'm just double checking to see if there's any other

1899
01:28:48,840 --> 01:28:49,360
tracks.

1900
01:28:49,360 --> 01:28:51,080
I've been tranced by the ice cream truck music.

1901
01:28:51,080 --> 01:28:53,080
Ice cream man, ice cream man, ice cream man.

1902
01:28:53,080 --> 01:28:53,800
He's right there.

1903
01:28:53,800 --> 01:28:54,680
Is he right up front?

1904
01:28:54,680 --> 01:28:57,400
I know it's kind of weird that it started showing up

1905
01:28:57,400 --> 01:28:59,800
like in the last year or so, the ice cream trucks

1906
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:00,880
went driving by.

1907
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:02,800
And if you buy ice cream once, they'll

1908
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:05,120
come every day for like an entire year.

1909
01:29:05,120 --> 01:29:09,640
OK, he also did Mix Two Tracks, which is LL Cool J's I Can't

1910
01:29:09,640 --> 01:29:11,480
Live Without My Radio, and Grandmaster Flash

1911
01:29:11,480 --> 01:29:13,440
and the Furious Five's The Message.

1912
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:16,680
And then the other one is Damian Marley's Welcome to Jam

1913
01:29:16,680 --> 01:29:20,000
Rock and Walter Murphy's A Fifth of Beethoven,

1914
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,840
which was on the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack, which

1915
01:29:22,840 --> 01:29:25,000
I have two copies of on vinyl.

1916
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:26,120
Because you're weird.

1917
01:29:26,120 --> 01:29:28,760
I got my mom's and my uncle's copies each.

1918
01:29:28,760 --> 01:29:31,320
It's all good.

1919
01:29:31,320 --> 01:29:34,400
And then there's also a Dollars and Cents Black Rock Track

1920
01:29:34,400 --> 01:29:35,680
for the game too.

1921
01:29:35,680 --> 01:29:37,840
But I just thought it was funny because the other article

1922
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:40,520
mentioned the other game that he had been motion captured in,

1923
01:29:40,520 --> 01:29:42,840
and you know what that was, Rob?

1924
01:29:42,840 --> 01:29:45,440
Wu-Tang Shaolin style fighting game for PS1.

1925
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:48,240
God, I remember that game.

1926
01:29:48,240 --> 01:29:52,160
Yes, it was like a, oh god, it was like the new Shaq-Fu.

1927
01:29:52,160 --> 01:29:53,760
But it wasn't really all that bad.

1928
01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:57,120
Remember that Def Jam, the rap fighting game,

1929
01:29:57,120 --> 01:29:58,600
there was one of those too?

1930
01:29:58,600 --> 01:30:03,160
Oh man, a lot of interesting stuff.

1931
01:30:03,160 --> 01:30:04,920
All right, Mega Man Universe.

1932
01:30:04,920 --> 01:30:07,480
More information was supposed to come out of PAX this week,

1933
01:30:07,480 --> 01:30:09,880
but I don't remember seeing anything additional on this.

1934
01:30:09,880 --> 01:30:11,920
Maybe somebody in chat can fill us in on this.

1935
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:13,400
Here's the thing, there was a story

1936
01:30:13,400 --> 01:30:14,760
saying that more Mega Man Universe

1937
01:30:14,760 --> 01:30:16,800
information was going to be coming out,

1938
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:18,720
because apparently they were giving away

1939
01:30:18,720 --> 01:30:20,400
some little things that look like, I don't know,

1940
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:25,680
like little, I don't know what those are supposed to be.

1941
01:30:25,680 --> 01:30:31,920
Are those like, I have no idea what that is supposed to be.

1942
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:33,040
Let me come look.

1943
01:30:33,040 --> 01:30:38,120
They're like little inflatable looking thingies.

1944
01:30:38,120 --> 01:30:39,480
With little pillows or something.

1945
01:30:39,480 --> 01:30:41,480
Oh yeah, they just look like little pillows.

1946
01:30:41,480 --> 01:30:44,160
Dude, the Ryu is kind of funny, but the Rock Man

1947
01:30:44,160 --> 01:30:46,400
looks like actually pretty cool.

1948
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:49,920
So apparently some of the stuff at Capcom's booth

1949
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:51,200
was supposed to be, you know, they

1950
01:30:51,200 --> 01:30:53,920
were supposed to be showing Mega Man Universe with more

1951
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:55,840
trailers and game levels.

1952
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:58,480
Ghost Trick, Okameda, and Resident Evil 5,

1953
01:30:58,480 --> 01:31:01,000
Bionic Commando Rearm 2, da da da.

1954
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:02,720
I haven't seen a whole lot of information

1955
01:31:02,720 --> 01:31:05,640
since then coming out about this Mega Man Universe.

1956
01:31:05,640 --> 01:31:07,560
This is the last I'd heard of it anyway.

1957
01:31:07,560 --> 01:31:08,800
So I'm not sure if anything came out

1958
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:09,680
within the past couple days.

1959
01:31:09,680 --> 01:31:11,340
Let me see if there are any updates today

1960
01:31:11,340 --> 01:31:13,640
after we did the show roll.

1961
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:15,320
Oh, there is some footage, finally.

1962
01:31:15,320 --> 01:31:15,880
Yay.

1963
01:31:15,880 --> 01:31:16,840
OK, let's look at this.

1964
01:31:23,400 --> 01:31:26,000
Rob's giving us musical effects while he pulls up the footage.

1965
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:27,240
Sorry.

1966
01:31:27,240 --> 01:31:30,840
How about I go, doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.

1967
01:31:30,840 --> 01:31:31,560
Ready to mature.

1968
01:31:31,560 --> 01:31:33,560
Ah, stinking trailers.

1969
01:31:33,560 --> 01:31:36,400
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.

1970
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:38,400
OK, I'm getting it, I'm getting it, I'm getting it.

1971
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:40,880
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.

1972
01:31:40,880 --> 01:31:42,040
OK, are we ready?

1973
01:31:42,040 --> 01:31:44,240
No, we have to go by the sponsor message real quick.

1974
01:31:44,240 --> 01:31:45,520
So should I do more of the?

1975
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:46,640
No, it's nine seconds.

1976
01:31:46,640 --> 01:31:47,440
We're good.

1977
01:31:47,440 --> 01:31:49,520
I totally forgot whose level I was doing.

1978
01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:52,040
Oh, Metal Man, I think.

1979
01:31:52,040 --> 01:31:52,640
OK, here we go.

1980
01:31:55,640 --> 01:31:57,680
ESRB, da da da, who cares.

1981
01:31:57,680 --> 01:32:00,240
Shut up.

1982
01:32:00,240 --> 01:32:04,240
Capcom logo, doo doo doo doo doo.

1983
01:32:04,240 --> 01:32:05,720
Aren't you all pretty now?

1984
01:32:05,720 --> 01:32:08,120
Konnichiwa, Mega Man creator.

1985
01:32:08,120 --> 01:32:09,560
Hi, I'm the creator of Mega Man.

1986
01:32:09,560 --> 01:32:14,520
Mega Man, you know, a lot of people who saw the first Mega

1987
01:32:14,520 --> 01:32:18,440
Man universe trailer are confused about wondering how

1988
01:32:18,440 --> 01:32:21,520
this game will play.

1989
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:24,280
Since the trailer didn't reveal all that much.

1990
01:32:24,280 --> 01:32:27,240
Yeah, we sure we want to know you jerk.

1991
01:32:27,240 --> 01:32:29,040
He's here to clear up the confusion.

1992
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:30,400
That's right.

1993
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:31,600
The first playable video.

1994
01:32:34,600 --> 01:32:36,000
And you can see how it actually works.

1995
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:40,000
Show me already.

1996
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:41,800
I hope this video gets you excited and has you looking

1997
01:32:41,800 --> 01:32:43,440
forward to more.

1998
01:32:43,440 --> 01:32:44,600
Hurry up.

1999
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:47,360
Why are you mad, though?

2000
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:49,240
There we go.

2001
01:32:49,240 --> 01:32:50,640
In your arm.

2002
01:32:50,640 --> 01:32:51,720
Play as Rock Man.

2003
01:33:00,320 --> 01:33:01,560
Ooh, the graphics look cool.

2004
01:33:01,560 --> 01:33:02,840
Wait, isn't that Metal Man's stage?

2005
01:33:02,840 --> 01:33:04,080
Yes, it is.

2006
01:33:07,080 --> 01:33:09,000
That's Fire Man's stage.

2007
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:10,040
This is the select music.

2008
01:33:10,040 --> 01:33:12,040
This is the character select music.

2009
01:33:12,040 --> 01:33:13,280
Well, the stage select.

2010
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:17,720
And that's Crash Man's level.

2011
01:33:17,720 --> 01:33:20,840
Dude, this is like Mega Man 2 redone.

2012
01:33:20,840 --> 01:33:21,960
Oh, that's new.

2013
01:33:21,960 --> 01:33:24,640
A level that says Mega Man.

2014
01:33:24,640 --> 01:33:25,560
That's...

2015
01:33:25,560 --> 01:33:28,680
Play as Ryu.

2016
01:33:28,680 --> 01:33:29,680
No way.

2017
01:33:29,680 --> 01:33:30,680
No way.

2018
01:33:30,680 --> 01:33:34,000
You are Mega Fight.

2019
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:35,880
He says your world Mega Fight.

2020
01:33:35,880 --> 01:33:38,560
So, OK, so some of the gameplay looks very Mega Man,

2021
01:33:38,560 --> 01:33:43,880
but then you see like this random Ryu.

2022
01:33:43,880 --> 01:33:44,880
What is that all about?

2023
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:46,960
I've got to see if there's more.

2024
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:48,360
Are these all just Mega Man?

2025
01:33:48,360 --> 01:33:54,480
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2026
01:33:54,480 --> 01:33:55,920
Are these all just the same?

2027
01:33:55,920 --> 01:34:00,920
Yeah, it's all the same trailer, I think.

2028
01:34:00,920 --> 01:34:03,920
Oh, no, they all got different gameplay trailers.

2029
01:34:03,920 --> 01:34:05,920
Ooh.

2030
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:10,920
It's like different websites got different gameplay trailers.

2031
01:34:10,920 --> 01:34:11,920
That's Wood Man's level.

2032
01:34:11,920 --> 01:34:14,920
Dude, it's like a Mega Man 2 upgrade.

2033
01:34:14,920 --> 01:34:16,920
Plus some, I think.

2034
01:34:20,920 --> 01:34:21,920
Play as Ryu.

2035
01:34:21,920 --> 01:34:22,920
No way.

2036
01:34:22,920 --> 01:34:25,920
I'm going to see like actual one that actually shows.

2037
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:28,920
Let's see what this trailer has in it here.

2038
01:34:28,920 --> 01:34:31,920
I think they're all going to be Mega Man.

2039
01:34:31,920 --> 01:34:32,920
Oh, my God.

2040
01:34:32,920 --> 01:34:33,920
Really?

2041
01:34:33,920 --> 01:34:36,920
There's no controls in it.

2042
01:34:36,920 --> 01:34:40,920
I do admit that he's actually really cute.

2043
01:34:40,920 --> 01:34:41,920
All right.

2044
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:44,920
I'm not going to play that third one because we can't skip through it.

2045
01:34:44,920 --> 01:34:45,920
All right.

2046
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:47,920
So it's a Mega Man type of like game.

2047
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:51,920
Oh, so we say there's a triple video out there.

2048
01:34:51,920 --> 01:34:55,920
I'm looking at our chat room there.

2049
01:34:55,920 --> 01:34:58,920
It shows all three side by side.

2050
01:34:58,920 --> 01:35:01,920
Oh, let's see if I can get that.

2051
01:35:01,920 --> 01:35:02,920
Why not?

2052
01:35:02,920 --> 01:35:04,920
We have extra time because of the marathon show.

2053
01:35:04,920 --> 01:35:11,920
I'm going to do Mega Man universe triple video.

2054
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:14,920
Okay, Mega Man universe triple video.

2055
01:35:14,920 --> 01:35:16,920
I don't see it.

2056
01:35:16,920 --> 01:35:20,920
I see official teaser trailer, which is that same thing we saw before.

2057
01:35:20,920 --> 01:35:22,920
This is wonderful radio.

2058
01:35:22,920 --> 01:35:27,920
Oh, shush.

2059
01:35:27,920 --> 01:35:33,920
You would think that they would have like actual like footage that's shown up from PAX, but I guess not.

2060
01:35:33,920 --> 01:35:34,920
Maybe it's not out there on the floor.

2061
01:35:34,920 --> 01:35:36,920
I don't know.

2062
01:35:36,920 --> 01:35:37,920
All right.

2063
01:35:37,920 --> 01:35:38,920
Well, whatever.

2064
01:35:38,920 --> 01:35:39,920
I'm over it.

2065
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:40,920
Let's move on to some more news.

2066
01:35:40,920 --> 01:35:45,920
We'll get more information on this in the coming weeks, I'm sure.

2067
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:47,920
Dark Sakura.

2068
01:35:47,920 --> 01:35:49,920
Other news.

2069
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:54,920
How about EA actually trying to cover their ass?

2070
01:35:54,920 --> 01:36:01,920
They basically are trying to defend their whole stupid little online pass deal.

2071
01:36:01,920 --> 01:36:06,920
And there's a quote out here put by EA Sports dude Peter Moore.

2072
01:36:06,920 --> 01:36:11,920
Digital delivery, maintaining servers able to support that volume of people every 24 hours.

2073
01:36:11,920 --> 01:36:13,920
A solid billing infrastructure and customer support.

2074
01:36:13,920 --> 01:36:16,920
It all takes time, effort, and money, and we're at the cutting edge of that.

2075
01:36:16,920 --> 01:36:23,920
Online pass is a way of bringing more digital experiences quicker from day one, getting people new content.

2076
01:36:23,920 --> 01:36:26,920
Yeah, they're just saying this shit costs money.

2077
01:36:26,920 --> 01:36:28,920
We need more of it.

2078
01:36:28,920 --> 01:36:29,920
The end.

2079
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:30,920
Yeah, we all need more money.

2080
01:36:30,920 --> 01:36:31,920
I want more money.

2081
01:36:31,920 --> 01:36:35,920
EA should give me $10 because I need to have money to buy their games.

2082
01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:37,920
They'd have to pay me to play their games.

2083
01:36:37,920 --> 01:36:43,920
I mean, well, not for Sims 3, but like for, you know, sports games.

2084
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:44,920
You know what they need?

2085
01:36:44,920 --> 01:36:45,920
Huh?

2086
01:36:45,920 --> 01:36:52,920
They need, um, EA needs to put out Wii figure skating and you use the balance board.

2087
01:36:52,920 --> 01:36:55,920
And you have to balance to do all the tricks right on there with your Wiimotes in your hand.

2088
01:36:55,920 --> 01:36:57,920
That sounds hard.

2089
01:36:57,920 --> 01:36:58,920
That would be amazing.

2090
01:36:58,920 --> 01:36:59,920
I'd play that.

2091
01:36:59,920 --> 01:37:03,920
Speaking of amazing, this is probably the most amazing news story we've had all week.

2092
01:37:03,920 --> 01:37:08,920
Commodore USA is going to be making modern PCs, but in replica cases.

2093
01:37:08,920 --> 01:37:10,920
And I think that is like so badass.

2094
01:37:10,920 --> 01:37:18,920
Um, apparently the Commodore PC 64 will actually have an Intel Atom 535 processor with NVIDIA

2095
01:37:18,920 --> 01:37:24,920
Ion 2 graphics, four gigabytes of DDR3 RAM, a terabyte hard drive and a DVD-ROM optionally

2096
01:37:24,920 --> 01:37:26,920
upgradeable to Blu-ray.

2097
01:37:26,920 --> 01:37:27,920
That is so hot.

2098
01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:31,920
I actually kind of want one, but it's in a Commodore 64 replica case.

2099
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:36,920
So you can party like it's 1983.

2100
01:37:36,920 --> 01:37:37,920
That's pretty cool.

2101
01:37:37,920 --> 01:37:38,920
Not a lot else with that.

2102
01:37:38,920 --> 01:37:40,920
I'm wondering, I don't see a price though.

2103
01:37:40,920 --> 01:37:43,920
That's the one thing I'd like to see is a price.

2104
01:37:43,920 --> 01:37:44,920
Let me see.

2105
01:37:44,920 --> 01:37:46,920
Nope, of course they don't say what it is.

2106
01:37:46,920 --> 01:37:50,920
I'm looking at the original press release here to see what it looks like.

2107
01:37:50,920 --> 01:37:55,920
It will have integrated Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, 6-in-1 media card reader.

2108
01:37:55,920 --> 01:37:57,920
Nope, no prices though.

2109
01:37:57,920 --> 01:37:59,920
Which means expensive.

2110
01:37:59,920 --> 01:38:02,920
Yikes.

2111
01:38:02,920 --> 01:38:03,920
Well, I'm still looking forward to it.

2112
01:38:03,920 --> 01:38:05,920
I don't know about you guys.

2113
01:38:05,920 --> 01:38:08,920
I see folks in chat room, ooh, want.

2114
01:38:08,920 --> 01:38:10,920
That sounds like it could be fun.

2115
01:38:10,920 --> 01:38:12,920
What do you have, DarkSakura?

2116
01:38:12,920 --> 01:38:14,920
Well, I have different news.

2117
01:38:14,920 --> 01:38:17,920
There was a game that the Burnout developers were going to be making.

2118
01:38:17,920 --> 01:38:19,920
Do you know what that was?

2119
01:38:19,920 --> 01:38:20,920
Skate or Die.

2120
01:38:20,920 --> 01:38:22,920
Do you remember Skate or Die?

2121
01:38:22,920 --> 01:38:23,920
I sure do.

2122
01:38:23,920 --> 01:38:24,920
Yes.

2123
01:38:24,920 --> 01:38:34,920
They were going to do it GTA style, apparently, instead of just having it be all tricks and stuff.

2124
01:38:34,920 --> 01:38:36,920
That would have been kind of cool.

2125
01:38:36,920 --> 01:38:37,920
I wonder why they canned it.

2126
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:41,920
Did they talk about why it got canned or why they decided not to do it or what happened?

2127
01:38:41,920 --> 01:38:46,920
Well, EA and Criterion basically got on each other's asses again.

2128
01:38:46,920 --> 01:38:52,920
And so Criterion then went to do Need for Speed.

2129
01:38:52,920 --> 01:38:57,920
And it just looks like it just kind of fell through the cracks.

2130
01:38:57,920 --> 01:38:58,920
That sucks.

2131
01:38:58,920 --> 01:38:59,920
That could have been kind of cool.

2132
01:38:59,920 --> 01:39:01,920
I remember Ski or Die.

2133
01:39:01,920 --> 01:39:03,920
That was the quote-unquote sequel.

2134
01:39:03,920 --> 01:39:09,920
My BFF in grade school used to get blisters on the palm of his hands.

2135
01:39:09,920 --> 01:39:15,920
Like, really gross blisters from playing Skate or Die on his PC, his IBM.

2136
01:39:15,920 --> 01:39:17,920
And then I guess I think it was the halfpipe.

2137
01:39:17,920 --> 01:39:21,920
You had to roll your palm across the number pad to do the flips.

2138
01:39:21,920 --> 01:39:23,920
Used to get blisters from that game.

2139
01:39:23,920 --> 01:39:24,920
Oh my gosh.

2140
01:39:24,920 --> 01:39:25,920
Cool story, bro.

2141
01:39:25,920 --> 01:39:27,920
That just sounds nasty.

2142
01:39:27,920 --> 01:39:30,920
The one I remember, it wasn't Skate or Die.

2143
01:39:30,920 --> 01:39:35,920
I remember quite as fondly as I do 720, which was an Atari skating game.

2144
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:36,920
Did you play this, Bradley?

2145
01:39:36,920 --> 01:39:37,920
Yes, yes.

2146
01:39:37,920 --> 01:39:38,920
I played it a bunch.

2147
01:39:38,920 --> 01:39:40,920
That's where you get chased by bees, if you're not fast enough.

2148
01:39:40,920 --> 01:39:43,920
I actually got to play it again at the California Extreme.

2149
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:44,920
Oh, yeah?

2150
01:39:44,920 --> 01:39:49,920
Yeah, that was a hand killer just because doing the spin and the controller a bunch.

2151
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:52,920
Yeah, because it was all trackball, right?

2152
01:39:52,920 --> 01:39:53,920
No, no.

2153
01:39:53,920 --> 01:39:54,920
It's a controller that goes around in a circle.

2154
01:39:54,920 --> 01:39:55,920
Oh, that's right.

2155
01:39:55,920 --> 01:39:56,920
Yeah, the controller's like...

2156
01:39:56,920 --> 01:39:58,920
But it doesn't stand up.

2157
01:39:58,920 --> 01:40:02,920
It's always tilted in one way, so it's really weird to control.

2158
01:40:02,920 --> 01:40:05,920
Well, that's the direction you go in when you skate.

2159
01:40:05,920 --> 01:40:09,920
You press the button to kick, and then you go in the direction that you have the joystick

2160
01:40:09,920 --> 01:40:12,920
in, and then you spin it around as you need to.

2161
01:40:12,920 --> 01:40:15,920
But then you would have these really epically long levels.

2162
01:40:15,920 --> 01:40:18,920
There was a very unique Atari hardware at that time, because there were other games

2163
01:40:18,920 --> 01:40:20,920
that looked very similar to it.

2164
01:40:20,920 --> 01:40:22,920
Like hard driving, I think, is one.

2165
01:40:22,920 --> 01:40:25,920
And the Indiana Jones game was on that same hardware.

2166
01:40:25,920 --> 01:40:28,920
There were a lot of Voca games Atari put out that all kind of ran on that same thing.

2167
01:40:28,920 --> 01:40:29,920
720.

2168
01:40:29,920 --> 01:40:32,920
I think it's in some of the Midway classic collections, too.

2169
01:40:32,920 --> 01:40:33,920
I do believe you are correct.

2170
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:34,920
Yeah.

2171
01:40:34,920 --> 01:40:35,920
So I don't know why they got...

2172
01:40:35,920 --> 01:40:38,920
Oh, no, because they picked up the Atari arcade assets at some point, I think.

2173
01:40:38,920 --> 01:40:39,920
So...

2174
01:40:39,920 --> 01:40:42,920
And they should say, skate or die.

2175
01:40:42,920 --> 01:40:43,920
Yeah.

2176
01:40:43,920 --> 01:40:44,920
Very cool.

2177
01:40:44,920 --> 01:40:48,920
Well, the next story, this kind of came up earlier in the show, but I have it listed,

2178
01:40:48,920 --> 01:40:49,920
so I'll mention this.

2179
01:40:49,920 --> 01:40:53,920
Final Fantasy XIV, the beta was actually delayed a little bit.

2180
01:40:53,920 --> 01:40:58,920
It was supposed to start originally on August 31st, but they actually scheduled...

2181
01:40:58,920 --> 01:41:02,920
They had to delay it a day because of critical bugs and all this stuff.

2182
01:41:02,920 --> 01:41:04,920
But here's the crazy thing.

2183
01:41:04,920 --> 01:41:08,920
Like, you know, a lot of people have been having difficulty getting into the open beta.

2184
01:41:08,920 --> 01:41:12,920
There's been limited sign-ups and all this other stuff going on.

2185
01:41:12,920 --> 01:41:15,920
They stopped issuing beta codes.

2186
01:41:15,920 --> 01:41:17,920
They took down the installer altogether.

2187
01:41:17,920 --> 01:41:18,920
It's all crazy.

2188
01:41:18,920 --> 01:41:23,920
September 22nd is supposed to be the launch of this game.

2189
01:41:23,920 --> 01:41:24,920
Three weeks.

2190
01:41:24,920 --> 01:41:27,920
This game is supposed to launch.

2191
01:41:27,920 --> 01:41:30,920
That'll go over well, I'm sure.

2192
01:41:30,920 --> 01:41:32,920
So I don't know.

2193
01:41:32,920 --> 01:41:36,920
What made you decide not to get the Final Fantasy XIV beta, Alan?

2194
01:41:36,920 --> 01:41:40,920
Watching you play it and your less than stellar feedback of it when you played it.

2195
01:41:40,920 --> 01:41:41,920
Yeah, pretty much.

2196
01:41:41,920 --> 01:41:43,920
Were you interested in it before?

2197
01:41:43,920 --> 01:41:46,920
Well, yeah, I signed up when you did for the...

2198
01:41:46,920 --> 01:41:48,920
Oh, I thought you were just doing that for me.

2199
01:41:48,920 --> 01:41:55,920
Well, I mean, I'm into WoW now, so I've got enough interest in MMOs to at least check out the competition.

2200
01:41:55,920 --> 01:41:57,920
But you were playing MMOs before.

2201
01:41:57,920 --> 01:41:58,920
Wow, City Heroes, right?

2202
01:41:58,920 --> 01:41:59,920
Yeah, City Heroes.

2203
01:41:59,920 --> 01:42:01,920
But you never got Going Rogue, did you?

2204
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:03,920
Have you read anything on it?

2205
01:42:03,920 --> 01:42:09,920
I checked Metacritic and I think Game Rankings the week it came out and it didn't have anything.

2206
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:13,920
So I don't think that IGN and all the big review sites have treated it as a priority.

2207
01:42:13,920 --> 01:42:16,920
Maybe now there are some reviews up.

2208
01:42:16,920 --> 01:42:19,920
Well, let's take a look. We have a little time.

2209
01:42:19,920 --> 01:42:23,920
Because it was an actual standalone release, right?

2210
01:42:23,920 --> 01:42:34,920
Yeah, if you buy the Going Rogue edition, which is like $29.95, if you plug in that license, it's access to the whole game.

2211
01:42:34,920 --> 01:42:37,920
Yep, no one's reviewed it yet.

2212
01:42:37,920 --> 01:42:39,920
Yeah, none.

2213
01:42:39,920 --> 01:42:41,920
Wow.

2214
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:46,920
Still going strong, but it's communities really underground. No one talks about COH anymore.

2215
01:42:46,920 --> 01:42:48,920
That's weird.

2216
01:42:48,920 --> 01:42:53,920
I see a comment from Ziba in our chatroom saying, I still say Guild Wars 2 for the win.

2217
01:42:53,920 --> 01:42:58,920
Yeah, after looking at that footage, Guild Wars was kind of like, I can kind of take it or leave it.

2218
01:42:58,920 --> 01:43:05,920
Like, Guild Wars was kind of a really cool game to just have on standby for those days you just don't want to play WoW anymore.

2219
01:43:05,920 --> 01:43:08,920
Like, oh, I'd fire up Guild Wars because I don't pay a monthly fee for this game.

2220
01:43:08,920 --> 01:43:10,920
It's a great game to have on standby.

2221
01:43:10,920 --> 01:43:13,920
I have, like, the Uber collection that went on sale on Steam or whatever.

2222
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:19,920
But then Guild Wars 2, some of that gameplay footage came out, it looks awesome.

2223
01:43:19,920 --> 01:43:23,920
Like, I got to say, I'm really, like, it's all action-y and it looks really cool.

2224
01:43:23,920 --> 01:43:27,920
See, that's where, like, MMOs are going these days, is more action-y, and that's cool.

2225
01:43:27,920 --> 01:43:31,920
I'm really excited about DC Universe Online if I mentioned that.

2226
01:43:31,920 --> 01:43:34,920
Where's the beta for that? I want to play that.

2227
01:43:34,920 --> 01:43:36,920
Alright.

2228
01:43:36,920 --> 01:43:39,920
Dar Sakura, more news for us?

2229
01:43:39,920 --> 01:43:41,920
I do indeed.

2230
01:43:41,920 --> 01:43:47,920
This is actually the Sega lineup for Tokyo Game Show.

2231
01:43:47,920 --> 01:43:54,920
Actually, Sega Konami Level 5 and Tecmo Koei for Tokyo Game Show 2010.

2232
01:43:54,920 --> 01:43:58,920
We've got, from Sega, Vanquish, Virtual on Force.

2233
01:43:58,920 --> 01:44:00,920

2240
01:44:45,920 --> 01:44:50,920

That's actually being put out by Youks.

2243
01:45:02,920 --> 01:45:05,920

2246
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:31,920

2247
01:45:31,920 --> 01:45:33,920
So, pretty big lineup.

2248
01:45:33,920 --> 01:45:35,920
And that's just so far.

2249
01:45:35,920 --> 01:45:38,920
People who are going to Tokyo Game Show, get me stuff.

2250
01:45:38,920 --> 01:45:44,920
I'd like to go like one day, just once to say I did it.

2251
01:45:44,920 --> 01:45:47,920
I'd like to go longer than one day so I can actually spend some time in Japan.

2252
01:45:47,920 --> 01:45:50,920
I meant like one day I would like to go, sorry, for the whole show.

2253
01:45:50,920 --> 01:45:56,920
Alright, this is another story about some big surprises, and I think this will make Alan very happy.

2254
01:45:56,920 --> 01:46:02,920
In an interview with PC Gamer, Gabe Newell from Valve, of course, has said,

2255
01:46:02,920 --> 01:46:07,920
I can guarantee you people are going to be surprised at stuff we do.

2256
01:46:07,920 --> 01:46:10,920
And this is after he already, are you rolling your eyes?

2257
01:46:10,920 --> 01:46:16,920
This is after they came out and said the whole Steam Cloud support on PS3 and all that good stuff.

2258
01:46:16,920 --> 01:46:19,920
But he said, quote, this isn't going to stop anytime soon.

2259
01:46:19,920 --> 01:46:23,920
I'm just laughing because people will be shocked again.

2260
01:46:23,920 --> 01:46:29,920
We have three big surprises in the next 12 months at least.

2261
01:46:29,920 --> 01:46:30,920
Thoughts on that, Alan?

2262
01:46:30,920 --> 01:46:36,920
If you are a Half-Life fan, you really aren't allowed to get mad at Gabe Newell and Valve,

2263
01:46:36,920 --> 01:46:41,920
because if you do, they might keep Half-Life in a closet forever.

2264
01:46:41,920 --> 01:46:43,920
It's very much an abusive relationship.

2265
01:46:43,920 --> 01:46:47,920
And of course, you know, all of the article, all of the blogs that are posting this story

2266
01:46:47,920 --> 01:46:51,920
have a picture of Gordon Freeman in his HEV suit.

2267
01:46:51,920 --> 01:46:55,920
I really hope it's something Half-Life.

2268
01:46:55,920 --> 01:46:59,920
Half-Life 2 came out six years ago.

2269
01:46:59,920 --> 01:47:02,920
Hey, it took 11 years for StarCraft 2, just saying.

2270
01:47:02,920 --> 01:47:05,920
Well, yeah.

2271
01:47:05,920 --> 01:47:10,920
And I only really play first-person shooters like Bioshock or Half-Life that have that narrative.

2272
01:47:10,920 --> 01:47:16,920
And the story, like the cliffhanger at the end of Half-Life 2 Episode 2 was so epic.

2273
01:47:16,920 --> 01:47:21,920
It's like I'm a five-year-old on Christmas morning. I want that game.

2274
01:47:21,920 --> 01:47:25,920
Now, there was recently a trademark for Defense of the Ancients,

2275
01:47:25,920 --> 01:47:31,920
and that of course makes people speculate that there will be a real-time strategy game update to Defense of the Ancients.

2276
01:47:31,920 --> 01:47:32,920
So, don't know.

2277
01:47:32,920 --> 01:47:37,920
Well, yeah, that's that Warcraft 3 mod that Valve is trying to publish as their own thing.

2278
01:47:37,920 --> 01:47:38,920
Oh, really?

2279
01:47:38,920 --> 01:47:39,920
And Blizzard was like...

2280
01:47:39,920 --> 01:47:41,920
Oh, that's right, because they hired all those people, huh?

2281
01:47:41,920 --> 01:47:43,920
And Blizzard was like, LOL, no.

2282
01:47:43,920 --> 01:47:46,920
I think that's still in litigation right now.

2283
01:47:46,920 --> 01:47:49,920
Well, maybe they'll just change the name. Who knows?

2284
01:47:49,920 --> 01:47:51,920
Be interesting if that happens.

2285
01:47:51,920 --> 01:47:55,920
Maybe Left 4 Dead 3? I'm sure that would be a big surprise.

2286
01:47:55,920 --> 01:47:57,920
Oh, you're rolling your eyes over there. I see you.

2287
01:47:57,920 --> 01:47:59,920
Don't think I don't see you rolling your eyes.

2288
01:47:59,920 --> 01:48:02,920
Not a Left 4 Dead fan?

2289
01:48:02,920 --> 01:48:12,920
It's a great game, but I feel that they have other franchises they should focus on more promptly.

2290
01:48:12,920 --> 01:48:17,920
You don't want to see a new IP come out of Valve? The next Portal?

2291
01:48:17,920 --> 01:48:22,920
They should work on a damn thing until the next Half-Life. Like, they don't know.

2292
01:48:22,920 --> 01:48:24,920
You don't want to see Portal 3?

2293
01:48:24,920 --> 01:48:30,920
No, I will go to their office with a ruler and I will slap the little knuckles of their programmers' heads and go,

2294
01:48:30,920 --> 01:48:32,920
What are you working on? That's not Half-Life.

2295
01:48:32,920 --> 01:48:36,920
WAP. WAP. And then security will drag me out.

2296
01:48:36,920 --> 01:48:40,920
That is how I feel.

2297
01:48:40,920 --> 01:48:41,920
Promise.

2298
01:48:41,920 --> 01:48:48,920
How does Chat feel about this? Does Chat want their Half-Life? Either 3 proper or Episode 3 proper?

2299
01:48:48,920 --> 01:48:56,920
Monty Boggs in Chat says, I already forgot how Episode 2 ended. I should probably go back if they do announce a sequel.

2300
01:48:56,920 --> 01:49:02,920
Floppy Discourse in Chat says, Left 4 Dead 3 rocks.

2301
01:49:02,920 --> 01:49:06,920
It probably came out already because they have a six month development cycle on those games.

2302
01:49:06,920 --> 01:49:09,920
But yet Half-Life takes six years.

2303
01:49:09,920 --> 01:49:14,920
What do you think they're doing to this game to make it so... I don't know. I guess I shouldn't ask these questions.

2304
01:49:14,920 --> 01:49:20,920
I read the Half-Life 2 book that came out about how big Half-Life 2 was going to be.

2305
01:49:20,920 --> 01:49:24,920
Half-Life 2 for a first person shooter is a really long game.

2306
01:49:24,920 --> 01:49:32,920
All of the conceptual stuff where we want this set piece and we want this event to happen, it was going to be like an 80 hour game.

2307
01:49:32,920 --> 01:49:38,920
And they had to cut out all this stuff. So, same thing could be happening for Half-Life 3.

2308
01:49:38,920 --> 01:49:41,920
Red Entertainment in Chat says, I wanted Half-Life 2 years ago.

2309
01:49:41,920 --> 01:49:45,920
Dark Circuitry says, More Half-Life heart.

2310
01:49:45,920 --> 01:49:51,920
And Dark Tetsuya says, No, there's only one game I'm looking forward to in the immediate future and it's on the Wii.

2311
01:49:51,920 --> 01:49:57,920
I'm guessing that's the La Mulana game. Didn't that already come out? No, I guess it's still in the future. I don't know.

2312
01:49:57,920 --> 01:50:06,920
Haseo Sumi-Ragawa is looking forward a little more to the Final Fantasy 7 Remake that still has not been announced and probably isn't ever going to be.

2313
01:50:06,920 --> 01:50:08,920
I hate to be a DVD gamer.

2314
01:50:08,920 --> 01:50:19,920
I'm really disappointed that we haven't heard anything about a DS or even DS3D, 3DS, Final Fantasy 5 or Final Fantasy 6.

2315
01:50:19,920 --> 01:50:24,920
You know how they remade the SNES ones. Oh yeah, Final Fantasy 4 was awesome.

2316
01:50:24,920 --> 01:50:30,920
Yeah, it was amazing. I think 6 might be too big of a game, but they could do 5. It would sell really well here.

2317
01:50:30,920 --> 01:50:39,920
Or 6. Don't take this the wrong way, but fuck 5. 6 is really where it's at.

2318
01:50:39,920 --> 01:50:47,920
Put the hate mail down. I still like Final Fantasy 5, but Final Fantasy 6 is way up here.

2319
01:50:47,920 --> 01:50:52,920
Final Fantasy 5 is vanilla ice cream. It's good and I'm not going to turn it down.

2320
01:50:52,920 --> 01:51:02,920
It's cool, but Final Fantasy 6 is like peanut butter cups and chocolate ice cream.

2321
01:51:02,920 --> 01:51:06,920
It's like words I shouldn't say on the radio.

2322
01:51:06,920 --> 01:51:11,920
We're at 745. Do we need a break then?

2323
01:51:11,920 --> 01:51:13,920
Yeah, because the place closes at 9.

2324
01:51:13,920 --> 01:51:18,920
Okay, let's break after that story and we'll come back and we'll do a few more.

2325
01:51:18,920 --> 01:51:20,920
No, you guys are going to do Ask Orange Lounge, right?

2326
01:51:20,920 --> 01:51:21,920
Yeah, we're going to do Ask Orange Lounge.

2327
01:51:21,920 --> 01:51:22,920
But they should send them to you.

2328
01:51:22,920 --> 01:51:23,920
To me.

2329
01:51:23,920 --> 01:51:26,920
So you're going to Ask Orange Lounge with Dark Sakura.

2330
01:51:26,920 --> 01:51:27,920
Via private message.

2331
01:51:27,920 --> 01:51:30,920
And the Skype line will also be open for you guys if you want to do that.

2332
01:51:30,920 --> 01:51:32,920
Okay, I'll come over.

2333
01:51:32,920 --> 01:51:39,920
Okay, sounds good. So we're going to take a quick music break while we order dinner and then we're going to come back and do some Ask Orange Lounge.

2334
01:51:39,920 --> 01:51:43,920
So send your questions again. Not me. They won't get ready if you send them to me. Dark Sakura in our chat room.

2335
01:51:43,920 --> 01:51:47,920
Chat.orangeloungeradio.com if you want to send in some questions.

2336
01:51:47,920 --> 01:51:51,920
We're going to take a quick break but we'll be right back with the Orange Lounge Radio Marathon Show.

2337
01:51:51,920 --> 01:51:54,920
We're like six hours in now almost. Oh my God.

2338
01:51:54,920 --> 01:51:58,920
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday.

2339
01:51:58,920 --> 01:52:02,920
It is September the 5th of 2010. It's Labor Day weekend.

2340
01:52:02,920 --> 01:52:07,920
We are starting to enter our sixth hour of the Orange Lounge Radio Marathon Show.

2341
01:52:07,920 --> 01:52:13,920
If you're just joining us at All Games Radio where we do tape our show live every Sunday, it's a little different.

2342
01:52:13,920 --> 01:52:16,920
You may have missed last week's show where we told you guys we're going to be doing something special this week.

2343
01:52:16,920 --> 01:52:25,920
Loki has already come and gone. He was here at two o'clock for the quote unquote normal show that went until about 5.30 and now we're kind of in the bonus portion.

2344
01:52:25,920 --> 01:52:31,920
But now that we are getting into the really random stuff, we actually have to eat. We kind of have to like stop to eat.

2345
01:52:31,920 --> 01:52:36,920
So but we're not going to stop the marathon. I'm actually going to run out and get what's called take and bake pizzas.

2346
01:52:36,920 --> 01:52:40,920
So I'm going to get pizzas and then we'll switch off and Jamie's actually going to bake them while we do some other topics.

2347
01:52:40,920 --> 01:52:42,920
I'm going to bake them.

2348
01:52:42,920 --> 01:52:46,920
Well, you're the woman. I'm scared. I'll help.

2349
01:52:46,920 --> 01:52:51,920
I knew it was coming. I don't want to burn down your house either. That's what it really boils down to.

2350
01:52:51,920 --> 01:52:54,920
But we'll figure something out. We'll make some talking heads while Rob cooks.

2351
01:52:54,920 --> 01:52:59,920
All right. So anyway, I'm going to step out to go do that.

2352
01:52:59,920 --> 01:53:05,920
But Dark Sakura is going to take over. God help you all. And do some Ask Orange Lounge, right?

2353
01:53:05,920 --> 01:53:12,920
Yes. All right. So, of course, it wouldn't be Ask Orange Lounge if we didn't have a theme song, right?

2354
01:53:12,920 --> 01:53:16,920
We could do a duet. OK, no.

2355
01:53:16,920 --> 01:53:23,920
Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question. What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?

2356
01:53:23,920 --> 01:53:31,920
Don't ask me any questions because I'm leaving this house because I know how this segment can sometimes go.

2357
01:53:31,920 --> 01:53:36,920
I thought you were going to say sometimes suck.

2358
01:53:36,920 --> 01:53:40,920
Do I look like Wayne Brady? Do I sing improv songs on command?

2359
01:53:40,920 --> 01:53:43,920
Make life crew and get the fuck out my house, bitch.

2360
01:53:43,920 --> 01:53:47,920
All right. Sky says do the live feed while getting pizza. I could do the Ustream.

2361
01:53:47,920 --> 01:53:50,920
No, I'm not going to do that and drive at the same time. You guys are crazy.

2362
01:53:50,920 --> 01:53:52,920
All right. I'm out.

2363
01:53:52,920 --> 01:53:55,920
I would be forced to yell at Rob for doing something dumb.

2364
01:53:55,920 --> 01:53:57,920
Be good, kids. I'll be back.

2365
01:53:57,920 --> 01:54:01,920
OK. OK, chatlings, let's see.

2366
01:54:01,920 --> 01:54:05,920
Haseo Sumiragawa. What's the story with the orange bat?

2367
01:54:05,920 --> 01:54:08,920
Oh, shit.

2368
01:54:08,920 --> 01:54:16,920
The orange bat came from March Madness, which was a DDR tournament that they held at Milpitas Golf Land.

2369
01:54:16,920 --> 01:54:30,920
And it was me and Rob and Jessica and at the time her fiancé and I think and somebody else who was with us.

2370
01:54:30,920 --> 01:54:31,920
I don't remember.

2371
01:54:31,920 --> 01:54:39,920
But we decided that we were just sick of all the people not really doing actual routines and when they were doing their things.

2372
01:54:39,920 --> 01:54:50,920
So we actually went and got plastic orange bats and little toy trumpets and did stomp to my beat.

2373
01:54:50,920 --> 01:54:56,920
And Rob and I proceeded to hit each other over the head with bats while the others played the trumpets.

2374
01:54:56,920 --> 01:55:01,920
And it was epic. And then the bat went around and was signed.

2375
01:55:01,920 --> 01:55:11,920
And I think Rob has his bat and then I have my bat. And my bat, I got signed by everyone in Step Squad and RTF to as many people as I could.

2376
01:55:11,920 --> 01:55:17,920
So the bat is in my garage right now.

2377
01:55:17,920 --> 01:55:23,920
So that's the story of the orange bat.

2378
01:55:23,920 --> 01:55:31,920
Dark Circuitry asks, which is the better game, in your guys' opinion, Pump It Up Pro or In The Groove?

2379
01:55:31,920 --> 01:55:33,920
Pump It Up.

2380
01:55:33,920 --> 01:55:36,920
Because, dude, caution drop.

2381
01:55:36,920 --> 01:55:40,920
No, I'm not a big fan of In The Groove. It's OK. It's playable.

2382
01:55:40,920 --> 01:55:43,920
But Pump It Up, they're just different types.

2383
01:55:43,920 --> 01:55:50,920
I mean, same theory, yes, but different type of game, if that makes sense.

2384
01:55:50,920 --> 01:55:55,920
Pump It Up is one of the more major DDR clones where it's the diagonals.

2385
01:55:55,920 --> 01:55:57,920
It's the five square one.

2386
01:55:57,920 --> 01:56:05,920
Yeah, I tried playing that once and I was so in the mindset of DDR that I made it through two songs and it basically broke me.

2387
01:56:05,920 --> 01:56:10,920
Like the different mechanics of the diagonals. I couldn't do it. I didn't touch it since.

2388
01:56:10,920 --> 01:56:13,920
And I know people who are really, really good at it who do doubles on them.

2389
01:56:13,920 --> 01:56:25,920
So but I just remembered what the how the caution drop used to work on that is that you'd follow the diagonal, your knee would hit the middle and then you're like your foot would hit the top of the back and then you'd slap the bottom two on those four.

2390
01:56:25,920 --> 01:56:27,920
Oh, wow.

2391
01:56:27,920 --> 01:56:30,920
They had stuff where you had to hit all five buttons and it was really difficult.

2392
01:56:30,920 --> 01:56:33,920
So.

2393
01:56:33,920 --> 01:56:35,920
So, yeah.

2394
01:56:35,920 --> 01:56:36,920
Ranma.

2395
01:56:36,920 --> 01:56:38,920
Hi.

2396
01:56:38,920 --> 01:56:44,920
During OLRthon, how about firing up the Wii for multiplayer Mario Kart or the 360 for Rock Band 2?

2397
01:56:44,920 --> 01:56:53,920
Well, that's because Dan and Alex have taken over the front room and are shooting each other stupid in a first person.

2398
01:56:53,920 --> 01:57:02,920
Well, not a first person, but in the shooting game, a shmup against each other that we will not mention the name of in this house because it's not here.

2399
01:57:02,920 --> 01:57:04,920
Right.

2400
01:57:04,920 --> 01:57:05,920
Right.

2401
01:57:05,920 --> 01:57:12,920
But maybe we can maybe we can convince them to relinquish the television at some point.

2402
01:57:12,920 --> 01:57:19,920
You know what? It just occurred to me it's eight o'clock. We've been going for six hours now.

2403
01:57:19,920 --> 01:57:21,920
We are awesome.

2404
01:57:21,920 --> 01:57:23,920
What's the target time? 1am, 2am?

2405
01:57:23,920 --> 01:57:24,920
Whenever.

2406
01:57:24,920 --> 01:57:25,920
Whenever.

2407
01:57:25,920 --> 01:57:29,920
Midnight is the baseline, I think.

2408
01:57:29,920 --> 01:57:32,920
Hoof hearted. I guess you like horses, huh?

2409
01:57:32,920 --> 01:57:35,920
Oh, it's Spazinator.

2410
01:57:35,920 --> 01:57:37,920
Your thought on this.

2411
01:57:37,920 --> 01:57:38,920
OK.

2412
01:57:38,920 --> 01:57:45,920
It's a one terabyte hard drive for 80 bucks.

2413
01:57:45,920 --> 01:57:46,920
OK.

2414
01:57:46,920 --> 01:57:47,920
Go for it.

2415
01:57:47,920 --> 01:57:53,920
It's not it doesn't transfer for 80 megabytes per second plug and play.

2416
01:57:53,920 --> 01:57:54,920
Not bad.

2417
01:57:54,920 --> 01:57:55,920
It's not great.

2418
01:57:55,920 --> 01:57:59,920
I mean, not like the super most awesome thing in the universe, but.

2419
01:57:59,920 --> 01:58:02,920
Hey, cheap terabyte hard drive. Why not?

2420
01:58:02,920 --> 01:58:13,920
I think last January or February, I got a terabyte external FireWire USB thing like that for about one hundred and ten to show how cheap hard drive space is becoming.

2421
01:58:13,920 --> 01:58:17,920
But I use it as my MP3 slash Torrance drive.

2422
01:58:17,920 --> 01:58:23,920
Yeah, I've actually filled up my 500 gig with MP3s and movies and stuff.

2423
01:58:23,920 --> 01:58:24,920
Yeah.

2424
01:58:24,920 --> 01:58:29,920
And a whole bunch of obscure Japanese Sendai TV.

2425
01:58:29,920 --> 01:58:31,920
Because I like my Tower Rangers.

2426
01:58:31,920 --> 01:58:33,920
I think your mic's cutting out.

2427
01:58:33,920 --> 01:58:36,920
Ah, no cutting out, Mike. You're not allowed.

2428
01:58:36,920 --> 01:58:40,920
So next question and thank you, Spazinator.

2429
01:58:40,920 --> 01:58:43,920
That that looks like it would be a decent purchase.

2430
01:58:43,920 --> 01:58:48,920
Floppy discourse.

2431
01:58:48,920 --> 01:58:49,920
Ah, funny.

2432
01:58:49,920 --> 01:58:51,920
Floppy discourse.

2433
01:58:51,920 --> 01:58:53,920
When is Final Fantasy 14 coming out?

2434
01:58:53,920 --> 01:58:56,920
I don't know and I don't care.

2435
01:58:56,920 --> 01:59:02,920
I think the PC date is, I think Rob just said it, the 23rd, 24th, three weeks.

2436
01:59:02,920 --> 01:59:03,920
Yeah.

2437
01:59:03,920 --> 01:59:07,920
We're supposed to have 14 available for PC in three weeks.

2438
01:59:07,920 --> 01:59:12,920
I've completely lost interest in the Final Fantasy Online series.

2439
01:59:12,920 --> 01:59:14,920
It's gorgeous. Beautiful.

2440
01:59:14,920 --> 01:59:18,920
But pretty does not necessarily mean good.

2441
01:59:18,920 --> 01:59:21,920
And I'm happy with my Star Trek.

2442
01:59:21,920 --> 01:59:24,920
Prettier just means on a PC that not that many people can play it.

2443
01:59:24,920 --> 01:59:26,920
Yeah, really.

2444
01:59:26,920 --> 01:59:29,920
So a lot of people are holding out for the PS3 version.

2445
01:59:29,920 --> 01:59:32,920
Um, Geovdia.

2446
01:59:32,920 --> 01:59:34,920
I have nothing to ask. I know it all.

2447
01:59:34,920 --> 01:59:35,920
Mwahahaha. Anyway, hi.

2448
01:59:35,920 --> 01:59:36,920
Hi!

2449
01:59:36,920 --> 01:59:38,920
Hi.

2450
01:59:38,920 --> 01:59:39,920
Goldanthro.

2451
01:59:39,920 --> 01:59:42,920
What was the first video game you ever played in your life?

2452
01:59:42,920 --> 01:59:47,920
Pinball tables don't count, but feel free to say what those are too if you remember.

2453
01:59:47,920 --> 01:59:49,920
My first video game.

2454
01:59:49,920 --> 01:59:52,920
Pong. Seriously.

2455
01:59:52,920 --> 01:59:55,920
I played Pong when I was little.

2456
01:59:55,920 --> 02:00:01,920
And then later on we went on to Kangaroo and Popeye and Donkey Kong.

2457
02:00:01,920 --> 02:00:07,920
Um, I got an Atari 2600 when I was four or five, I don't know, so any one of those games.

2458
02:00:07,920 --> 02:00:09,920
Probably Pac-Man, I'd say.

2459
02:00:09,920 --> 02:00:11,920
Oh, the Pac-Man version was awful though.

2460
02:00:11,920 --> 02:00:13,920
Yeah, bong bong.

2461
02:00:13,920 --> 02:00:16,920
But not as bad as E.T.

2462
02:00:16,920 --> 02:00:20,920
Yep, and I played the hell out of that game because when you're seven you don't really have taste.

2463
02:00:20,920 --> 02:00:21,920
You don't taste.

2464
02:00:21,920 --> 02:00:25,920
With that Pac-Man there was like, I don't know if there was like a setting or something.

2465
02:00:25,920 --> 02:00:31,920
After a while it was a weird thing where the power pellet moved to somewhere else other than the middle of the board.

2466
02:00:31,920 --> 02:00:34,920
It was like I had no idea how it happened.

2467
02:00:34,920 --> 02:00:36,920
Programming glitch.

2468
02:00:36,920 --> 02:00:47,920
The first thing I played I remember was when I got the Atari 2600 for I think it was the fourth Christmas when I was like four and then we played Asteroids first.

2469
02:00:47,920 --> 02:00:54,920
Because I remember the big splashy colored Asteroids floating around the screen.

2470
02:00:54,920 --> 02:00:59,920
That's pretty cool. That's a good game to have as your first. Pong is kind of boring.

2471
02:00:59,920 --> 02:01:05,920
Bong. Bong. Bong. Bong.

2472
02:01:05,920 --> 02:01:15,920
Okay. As far as pinball tables, I played all kinds of pinball when I was a kid so it's really hard to remember.

2473
02:01:15,920 --> 02:01:19,920
The first one I remember playing was, my dad had one called Genie.

2474
02:01:19,920 --> 02:01:21,920
No, which one?

2475
02:01:21,920 --> 02:01:22,920
It was called Genie.

2476
02:01:22,920 --> 02:01:24,920
Oh, one of the 50's ones or 60's ones?

2477
02:01:24,920 --> 02:01:26,920
Something like that. I don't really know.

2478
02:01:26,920 --> 02:01:29,920
Little rotating numbers?

2479
02:01:29,920 --> 02:01:43,920
I'm not sure if it was electronic or rotating. I think it was actually electronic numbers because I would remember because my dad got one that he has right now that I don't know.

2480
02:01:43,920 --> 02:01:45,920
Actually he might have gotten rid of it in his new house.

2481
02:01:45,920 --> 02:01:48,920
Found it by Gottlieb.

2482
02:01:48,920 --> 02:01:56,920
Genie, 1979, four player and it is indeed electronic. Is that it?

2483
02:01:56,920 --> 02:02:04,920
Yep, that's it. And it played like the place in France where the naked ladies dance.

2484
02:02:04,920 --> 02:02:10,920
There's a hole in the wall where the guys can see their mom.

2485
02:02:10,920 --> 02:02:12,920
Yeah, that was just a track sound.

2486
02:02:12,920 --> 02:02:17,920
I'll link that in the chat room.

2487
02:02:17,920 --> 02:02:22,920
I was hoping I might see it at the California stream but no they didn't have it.

2488
02:02:22,920 --> 02:02:29,920
You might be able to find it though when they do that other pinball expo, Pacific Pinball Expo.

2489
02:02:29,920 --> 02:02:35,920
They might have them there because they usually have older tables there.

2490
02:02:35,920 --> 02:02:41,920
But I really can't remember what my first pinball was and it was something old.

2491
02:02:41,920 --> 02:02:46,920
Now what's your first video game you've played in roller skates?

2492
02:02:46,920 --> 02:02:49,920
I think it was Contra.

2493
02:02:49,920 --> 02:02:52,920
I think it was Frogger.

2494
02:02:52,920 --> 02:02:53,920
Roller skates?

2495
02:02:53,920 --> 02:02:54,920
In roller skates.

2496
02:02:54,920 --> 02:02:56,920
I've never roller skated.

2497
02:02:56,920 --> 02:02:58,920
Ah!

2498
02:02:58,920 --> 02:03:04,920
You know the people who spent a lot of time roller skating in middle school and high school.

2499
02:03:04,920 --> 02:03:11,920
If they can answer the question, you know they played a lot of games at the roller rink.

2500
02:03:11,920 --> 02:03:13,920
I didn't really go to the roller rink all that much.

2501
02:03:13,920 --> 02:03:22,920
I think it was when our swim team had rink parties where every so often we went to the skating rink during our season.

2502
02:03:22,920 --> 02:03:26,920
Either that or elementary school we went there.

2503
02:03:26,920 --> 02:03:29,920
After that it was over and we didn't go anymore.

2504
02:03:29,920 --> 02:03:36,920
When I would go visit my dad in Dothan, Alabama, the roller rink there was called Bobaloo.

2505
02:03:36,920 --> 02:03:41,920
Bob, who was the owner, he since passed away and his wife was Lou.

2506
02:03:41,920 --> 02:03:44,920
Bob was friends with my granddaddy.

2507
02:03:44,920 --> 02:03:49,920
They taught amateur skating, like figure skating with roller skates.

2508
02:03:49,920 --> 02:03:54,920
I would always go up there and just go hang out and talk about granddaddy.

2509
02:03:54,920 --> 02:03:59,920
They had the same Frogger machine there while I was growing up.

2510
02:03:59,920 --> 02:04:01,920
It was still always in good working condition.

2511
02:04:01,920 --> 02:04:05,920
The joystick was a little sticky, but it was the same Frogger machine.

2512
02:04:05,920 --> 02:04:12,920
I played that same machine for easily 10 years.

2513
02:04:12,920 --> 02:04:16,920
Anyway, how about more questions?

2514
02:04:16,920 --> 02:04:20,920
Oh, and Tiara wants to add Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles at the roller rink.

2515
02:04:20,920 --> 02:04:28,920
I remember when to play an arcade game it was either the arcade when they still existed or the pizza parlor.

2516
02:04:28,920 --> 02:04:30,920
Arcade games there.

2517
02:04:30,920 --> 02:04:37,920
I remember when Street Fighter II came out, everyone went to 7-Eleven to play it. When 7-Eleven actually had arcade cabinets.

2518
02:04:37,920 --> 02:04:42,920
Oh yeah, we did go to that. I don't know if it was 7-Eleven, but it was some sort of convenience store.

2519
02:04:42,920 --> 02:04:45,920
Or like Circle K. Everyone would go play Street Fighter II.

2520
02:04:45,920 --> 02:04:48,920
This is out in South Carolina, so I don't remember what it was called.

2521
02:04:48,920 --> 02:04:52,920
I remember my high school band trip though. When we went to New York, we drove up.

2522
02:04:52,920 --> 02:04:55,920
We actually stopped in Washington, D.C. and then went on up to New York.

2523
02:04:55,920 --> 02:04:59,920
And that was when Mortal Kombat II was in beta testing.

2524
02:04:59,920 --> 02:05:02,920
With all the glitches and the continuous things.

2525
02:05:02,920 --> 02:05:04,920
So we were just, MORTAL KOMBAT WAH!

2526
02:05:04,920 --> 02:05:07,920
And the guys would just play it instead of eat.

2527
02:05:07,920 --> 02:05:11,920
But I would play that too, because I loved Mortal Kombat and I was really good with Katana.

2528
02:05:11,920 --> 02:05:18,920
But that was, you know, that's probably one of my favorite high school video game memories I think.

2529
02:05:18,920 --> 02:05:26,920
Other than me letting out a very loud curse while I was playing Zelda Link to the Past while my mom was in the other room.

2530
02:05:26,920 --> 02:05:29,920
Oops.

2531
02:05:29,920 --> 02:05:33,920
Okay, so. Ooh, Redertainment asked a doozy.

2532
02:05:33,920 --> 02:05:39,920
Which place is more openly hostile to outsiders and those who don't conform to the, quote, norm?

2533
02:05:39,920 --> 02:05:41,920
Alabama or Utah?

2534
02:05:41,920 --> 02:05:43,920
I've never been to Utah.

2535
02:05:43,920 --> 02:05:48,920
People are fairly nice in Alabama unless you just say they're very, like,

2536
02:05:48,920 --> 02:05:54,920
People try, they tend to be nice unless they're just super backwards rednecks, I guess.

2537
02:05:54,920 --> 02:05:59,920
I don't know. I can't tell you about Utah, I've never been.

2538
02:05:59,920 --> 02:06:01,920
Anyone here been to Utah?

2539
02:06:01,920 --> 02:06:03,920
I've been through there, but I haven't really dealt with the people that much.

2540
02:06:03,920 --> 02:06:06,920
I was actually there for a day and a half, too.

2541
02:06:06,920 --> 02:06:08,920
Yeah.

2542
02:06:08,920 --> 02:06:09,920
Couldn't really tell.

2543
02:06:09,920 --> 02:06:11,920
I think everyone's got their bad places.

2544
02:06:11,920 --> 02:06:14,920
Yeah, it just depends on who you're running to.

2545
02:06:14,920 --> 02:06:19,920
Like, don't go, like, wearing a, uh,

2546
02:06:19,920 --> 02:06:23,920
I voted for Perot shirt in, you know, Alabama or something.

2547
02:06:23,920 --> 02:06:29,920
Or go, or I miss Bill Clinton, you know.

2548
02:06:29,920 --> 02:06:31,920
Last comes from Dark Tetsuya.

2549
02:06:31,920 --> 02:06:34,920
Can we resurrect Name That Tune now that we have time, that is?

2550
02:06:34,920 --> 02:06:36,920
Um, no.

2551
02:06:36,920 --> 02:06:40,920
Not until Rob gets back anyway, because then Rob can do all that for us.

2552
02:06:40,920 --> 02:06:46,920
See, we're a little lazy right now, and we're just sort of leaning back and, uh,

2553
02:06:46,920 --> 02:06:48,920
Ooh, chit-chat.

2554
02:06:48,920 --> 02:06:51,920
People send me more questions, dammit!

2555
02:06:51,920 --> 02:06:53,920
A comment from Chad-

2556
02:06:53,920 --> 02:06:55,920
See if we can figure out what a game is from a description.

2557
02:06:55,920 --> 02:06:59,920
It's a comment from, uh, Chad from Hook Hearted, um,

2558
02:06:59,920 --> 02:07:03,920
that his first game on the 2600 was Combat and Outlaw.

2559
02:07:03,920 --> 02:07:05,920
I definitely own those games.

2560
02:07:05,920 --> 02:07:07,920
I want to say that the-

2561
02:07:07,920 --> 02:07:08,920
They're in the vault.

2562
02:07:08,920 --> 02:07:12,920
I guess, like, the elite edition of the 2600 or whatever had combat in it.

2563
02:07:12,920 --> 02:07:17,920
And I think it was the sports game where you had to hit the select switch to cycle through the basketball and-

2564
02:07:17,920 --> 02:07:18,920
Yeah.

2565
02:07:18,920 --> 02:07:19,920
I remember that.

2566
02:07:19,920 --> 02:07:21,920
Okay, did you ever play The Odyssey 2?

2567
02:07:21,920 --> 02:07:23,920
No.

2568
02:07:23,920 --> 02:07:26,920
We actually have one. We do not have a TV that it will run on.

2569
02:07:26,920 --> 02:07:28,920
Because it's that old.

2570
02:07:28,920 --> 02:07:30,920
Does it have, like, Venture as one of the games on it?

2571
02:07:30,920 --> 02:07:32,920
I don't think it had Venture, but it had this-

2572
02:07:32,920 --> 02:07:34,920
That was a different one then.

2573
02:07:34,920 --> 02:07:35,920
Oh, that was Colecovision.

2574
02:07:35,920 --> 02:07:38,920
It had Casey's Crazy Chase and Casey Munchkin, the ones that-

2575
02:07:38,920 --> 02:07:43,920
Crazy Chase was the clone of Pac-Man, and they got sued and had to bury all these copies,

2576
02:07:43,920 --> 02:07:46,920
so if you have a copy of Casey Munchkin, it's kind of rare.

2577
02:07:46,920 --> 02:07:48,920
Which I think I've got two copies now.

2578
02:07:48,920 --> 02:07:50,920
I've never played it.

2579
02:07:50,920 --> 02:07:54,920
But when I was in second grade, I want to say- okay, when did Gremlins come out?

2580
02:07:54,920 --> 02:07:57,920
Because I saw Gremlins when I lived in that house.

2581
02:07:57,920 --> 02:07:59,920
I want to say 85 or 86.

2582
02:07:59,920 --> 02:08:01,920
Okay, so then I was-

2583
02:08:01,920 --> 02:08:05,920
If it was 85, I was 9 then.

2584
02:08:05,920 --> 02:08:07,920
Because, yeah, I would have been 9.

2585
02:08:07,920 --> 02:08:11,920
But, yeah, my next door neighbor had a Colecovision.

2586
02:08:11,920 --> 02:08:19,920
And we would play this racing game and Casey Crazy Chase and a game called Cryptequip,

2587
02:08:19,920 --> 02:08:22,920
where you put in a phrase and scramble them up and you had to guess what it is.

2588
02:08:22,920 --> 02:08:25,920
And I was really good at those word scrambles.

2589
02:08:25,920 --> 02:08:33,920
But there was another game where you could play as a warrior or a mage or some other person,

2590
02:08:33,920 --> 02:08:37,920
and then a changeling, which you could turn into invisible and go through.

2591
02:08:37,920 --> 02:08:41,920
And it was like this- you had to get from one side to the other and get the treasure.

2592
02:08:41,920 --> 02:08:43,920
And then it was this weird, bizarre game.

2593
02:08:43,920 --> 02:08:45,920
And I'm trying to remember the name of it.

2594
02:08:45,920 --> 02:08:47,920
So this is kind of why I was asking.

2595
02:08:47,920 --> 02:08:52,920
There's a lot of good games that I used to play and I just can't remember the names of them anymore.

2596
02:08:52,920 --> 02:08:54,920
It's been so long.

2597
02:08:54,920 --> 02:08:58,920
What was the first RPG that you really invested in and finished?

2598
02:08:58,920 --> 02:09:02,920
Like, you saw the ending and you had 30 hours logged or however long it took.

2599
02:09:02,920 --> 02:09:06,920
First RPG. Video game.

2600
02:09:06,920 --> 02:09:10,920
I would almost say Final Fantasy, except I really lost interest.

2601
02:09:10,920 --> 02:09:14,920
So I'm going to go with...

2602
02:09:14,920 --> 02:09:17,920
I know it was on the Nintendo and I'm trying to remember what it was.

2603
02:09:17,920 --> 02:09:22,920
It wasn't Star Tropics, it was...

2604
02:09:22,920 --> 02:09:26,920
And I can't really put Zelda in it too, because Zelda was more...

2605
02:09:26,920 --> 02:09:31,920
Yeah, let's eliminate Zelda from this.

2606
02:09:31,920 --> 02:09:36,920
Because that's more adventure.

2607
02:09:36,920 --> 02:09:38,920
Maybe it was Star Tropics.

2608
02:09:38,920 --> 02:09:43,920
It's been a long time. Is Star Tropics or Faxana due or something like that?

2609
02:09:43,920 --> 02:09:51,920
Mine was Dragon Warrior 1 and then Final Fantasy 1 shortly after that on the NES.

2610
02:09:51,920 --> 02:09:54,920
Mine was Fantasy Star.

2611
02:09:54,920 --> 02:09:57,920
Actually, for the most part, I was actually watching my friend play it.

2612
02:09:57,920 --> 02:10:02,920
He actually got a... I don't know if he called up Sega or something and they sent him a cheat sheet

2613
02:10:02,920 --> 02:10:05,920
to walk through the game so that we could figure out how to get through it.

2614
02:10:05,920 --> 02:10:07,920
That's pretty cool.

2615
02:10:07,920 --> 02:10:10,920
That's what was a really fun game.

2616
02:10:10,920 --> 02:10:13,920
What's kind of funny about that game is that when I played...

2617
02:10:13,920 --> 02:10:21,920
Because it scrolls with six frames between the dungeon phase.

2618
02:10:21,920 --> 02:10:26,920
When you play Shining in the Darkness on Genesis, it only does a three frame thing.

2619
02:10:26,920 --> 02:10:28,920
So it looks kind of...

2620
02:10:28,920 --> 02:10:32,920
Going between those two is kind of weird.

2621
02:10:32,920 --> 02:10:34,920
Sort of jerky animation versus sort of smooth.

2622
02:10:34,920 --> 02:10:38,920
Because it's like really just a kind of simple wall.

2623
02:10:38,920 --> 02:10:45,920
Other than like in Shining in the Darkness, it's like all knobbly and out of stone and stuff.

2624
02:10:45,920 --> 02:10:47,920
Well, we've got a question from MakeRipper.

2625
02:10:47,920 --> 02:10:50,920
What's the next Sims expansion going to be about?

2626
02:10:50,920 --> 02:10:56,920
I'm not counting lightning. Aren't they doing like a Cars one?

2627
02:10:56,920 --> 02:10:58,920
I don't remember.

2628
02:10:58,920 --> 02:11:00,920
For Sims 4?

2629
02:11:00,920 --> 02:11:02,920
Sims 3.

2630
02:11:02,920 --> 02:11:04,920
I think your mic cut out again.

2631
02:11:04,920 --> 02:11:06,920
Oh, how about that?

2632
02:11:06,920 --> 02:11:08,920
Yeah, I don't really exactly remember what it is.

2633
02:11:08,920 --> 02:11:10,920
I thought that they were doing like a vehicle related one.

2634
02:11:10,920 --> 02:11:12,920
I can find out I guess.

2635
02:11:12,920 --> 02:11:14,920
Yeah.

2636
02:11:14,920 --> 02:11:18,920
I never really got into The Sims.

2637
02:11:18,920 --> 02:11:26,920
I remember I tried Sims 1 a year or two after it was out and it had already become a worldwide phenomenon.

2638
02:11:26,920 --> 02:11:28,920
I fussed with it for a couple hours.

2639
02:11:28,920 --> 02:11:30,920
I never...

2640
02:11:30,920 --> 02:11:32,920
I never got it. I never figured it out.

2641
02:11:32,920 --> 02:11:36,920
The only thing on here is just late night.

2642
02:11:36,920 --> 02:11:39,920
Nothing really after that.

2643
02:11:39,920 --> 02:11:41,920
So, at least it's listed anyway.

2644
02:11:41,920 --> 02:11:43,920
But hey dude, nightclubs.

2645
02:11:43,920 --> 02:11:47,920
It would be so cool if you could have gay dancing in The Sims.

2646
02:11:47,920 --> 02:11:49,920
That would be fun.

2647
02:11:49,920 --> 02:11:53,920
And I wonder what they're going to call beer and...

2648
02:11:53,920 --> 02:11:55,920
They call wine nectar.

2649
02:11:55,920 --> 02:11:56,920
Ah.

2650
02:11:56,920 --> 02:11:58,920
It should just be wine.

2651
02:11:58,920 --> 02:12:01,920
And they should have beer and they need to have hard booze.

2652
02:12:01,920 --> 02:12:05,920
You should build a moonshine still in your bathroom.

2653
02:12:05,920 --> 02:12:08,920
Like in Dukes of Hazzard.

2654
02:12:08,920 --> 02:12:14,920
Well, Sims 2 has so much fan made content from like the 14 whatever expansion packs that came out.

2655
02:12:14,920 --> 02:12:16,920
I'm sure you can do that stuff in Sims 2.

2656
02:12:16,920 --> 02:12:19,920
Oh, Sims 3 has a lot of that stuff too.

2657
02:12:19,920 --> 02:12:24,920
And, you know, people making game mods and everything and EA knows.

2658
02:12:24,920 --> 02:12:25,920
Yeah.

2659
02:12:25,920 --> 02:12:28,920
They're like, okay, well you get to reinstall all of your stuff again.

2660
02:12:28,920 --> 02:12:30,920
Um, wow, okay.

2661
02:12:30,920 --> 02:12:35,920
Redertainment also asks, I'm thinking of building a general media library in my house once I buy one.

2662
02:12:35,920 --> 02:12:38,920
How large is the room your vault is in?

2663
02:12:38,920 --> 02:12:40,920
It's a small bedroom.

2664
02:12:40,920 --> 02:12:45,920
It's like 7x7 or something in there.

2665
02:12:45,920 --> 02:12:47,920
Something like that, yeah.

2666
02:12:47,920 --> 02:12:54,920
It's big enough for a bed and a dresser and, you know, bedside table.

2667
02:12:54,920 --> 02:12:56,920
I'd probably put like a...

2668
02:12:56,920 --> 02:12:59,920
I think a queen size bed would fit in there, but...

2669
02:12:59,920 --> 02:13:02,920
We used to have the futon in there and it took up most of the room.

2670
02:13:02,920 --> 02:13:03,920
Yeah.

2671
02:13:03,920 --> 02:13:04,920
Yeah.

2672
02:13:04,920 --> 02:13:07,920
So, yeah, not a whole lot of...

2673
02:13:07,920 --> 02:13:08,920
But there's lots of shelves.

2674
02:13:08,920 --> 02:13:10,920
Things are up to the ceiling.

2675
02:13:10,920 --> 02:13:17,920
We put in a really big two shelf unit that our friend gave us that has a lot of space on it.

2676
02:13:17,920 --> 02:13:25,920
And then we have utility shelves in the closet and a number of just bookshelves up on the walls too.

2677
02:13:25,920 --> 02:13:35,920
So, yeah, we've maximized our space saving options and I totally recommend investing in bins with lids that you can see through.

2678
02:13:35,920 --> 02:13:40,920
Hey, no one's sending us any more questions.

2679
02:13:40,920 --> 02:13:44,920
Is that a Rob?

2680
02:13:44,920 --> 02:13:46,920
That's a Rob.

2681
02:13:46,920 --> 02:13:48,920
Of course, the first thing he says when he comes in is,

2682
02:13:48,920 --> 02:13:51,920
bastard, which is just like Rob.

2683
02:13:51,920 --> 02:13:53,920
Welcome back, Rob.

2684
02:13:53,920 --> 02:13:58,920
I'm coming to cook because I don't want Rob to burn my house down.

2685
02:13:58,920 --> 02:14:01,920
He never cooks, ever.

2686
02:14:01,920 --> 02:14:03,920
He made toast once.

2687
02:14:03,920 --> 02:14:11,920
I went to, when he and Loki had the place, I went and made lobster kabobs for Rob.

2688
02:14:11,920 --> 02:14:12,920
Good times.

2689
02:14:12,920 --> 02:14:13,920
They were.

2690
02:14:13,920 --> 02:14:15,920
Okay, I'm going to go cook.

2691
02:14:15,920 --> 02:14:16,920
Okay.

2692
02:14:16,920 --> 02:14:17,920
Are we playing chair roulette?

2693
02:14:17,920 --> 02:14:18,920
Where am I sitting?

2694
02:14:18,920 --> 02:14:19,920
You should go sit in Jeremy's chair.

2695
02:14:19,920 --> 02:14:20,920
Yeah.

2696
02:14:20,920 --> 02:14:22,920
Hi, I'm back everybody.

2697
02:14:22,920 --> 02:14:23,920
I had a good trip.

2698
02:14:23,920 --> 02:14:24,920
Did I miss any good questions?

2699
02:14:24,920 --> 02:14:26,920
What were questions that were asked?

2700
02:14:26,920 --> 02:14:31,920
Let's see, like, what was the first game you played?

2701
02:14:31,920 --> 02:14:34,920
I just saw they timed me.

2702
02:14:34,920 --> 02:14:37,920
Goldanthro says, it took Rob about 19 minutes and 43 seconds.

2703
02:14:37,920 --> 02:14:38,920
There it is.

2704
02:14:38,920 --> 02:14:39,920
You know what's funny?

2705
02:14:39,920 --> 02:14:40,920
I couldn't find the place either.

2706
02:14:40,920 --> 02:14:45,920
I had to drive because I knew it was at such and such street in I-80.

2707
02:14:45,920 --> 02:14:48,920
And I was like, okay, well, there's a lot of shops around there.

2708
02:14:48,920 --> 02:14:50,920
So I was kind of like looking around.

2709
02:14:50,920 --> 02:14:52,920
I'm like, do I go, I know of this.

2710
02:14:52,920 --> 02:14:55,920
And yeah, I had to drive around a little bit.

2711
02:14:55,920 --> 02:15:01,920
I would have gotten back in like 14 minutes if I hadn't, you know, gotten lost.

2712
02:15:01,920 --> 02:15:02,920
That's all right.

2713
02:15:02,920 --> 02:15:03,920
Okay.

2714
02:15:03,920 --> 02:15:04,920
Sorry.

2715
02:15:04,920 --> 02:15:05,920
The game.

2716
02:15:05,920 --> 02:15:06,920
Yes.

2717
02:15:06,920 --> 02:15:07,920
The questions I missed.

2718
02:15:07,920 --> 02:15:08,920
Good stuff.

2719
02:15:08,920 --> 02:15:09,920
Any good ones?

2720
02:15:09,920 --> 02:15:10,920
Yeah.

2721
02:15:10,920 --> 02:15:11,920
First game played.

2722
02:15:11,920 --> 02:15:16,920
And then I think I asked them what the first real RPG that you played from start to finish

2723
02:15:16,920 --> 02:15:17,920
was.

2724
02:15:17,920 --> 02:15:18,920
The first game played?

2725
02:15:18,920 --> 02:15:19,920
Yeah.

2726
02:15:19,920 --> 02:15:22,920
Like, I think ours was like Pac-Man, Combat Outlaw.

2727
02:15:22,920 --> 02:15:24,920
Oh, like the first game I remember playing.

2728
02:15:24,920 --> 02:15:31,920
I have memories of playing Spider-Man on the 2600.

2729
02:15:31,920 --> 02:15:34,920
But I don't think that was the very first game I ever played.

2730
02:15:34,920 --> 02:15:36,920
Probably Pac-Man on the 2600.

2731
02:15:36,920 --> 02:15:39,920
That really awful like, bong, bong, bong.

2732
02:15:39,920 --> 02:15:42,920
Like the old school like noises in it.

2733
02:15:42,920 --> 02:15:46,920
When you get a ghost, I can't get my voice to go that high.

2734
02:15:46,920 --> 02:15:50,920
Yeah, it was pretty bad.

2735
02:15:50,920 --> 02:15:52,920
Have you read the drama about why that happened?

2736
02:15:52,920 --> 02:15:57,920
I mean, when you read about the whole drama behind it, it actually makes a lot of sense

2737
02:15:57,920 --> 02:15:58,920
why that game turned out the way it is.

2738
02:15:58,920 --> 02:16:02,920
Like, they would not let him produce it on the cartridge he needed.

2739
02:16:02,920 --> 02:16:04,920
And that's why Ms. Pac-Man was so much better.

2740
02:16:04,920 --> 02:16:09,920
Yeah, everything about the, you know, the epic video game industry bust of 84 and all

2741
02:16:09,920 --> 02:16:13,920
of the shovelware they were putting out, you know, Pac-Man was related to that.

2742
02:16:13,920 --> 02:16:15,920
Because Pac-Man was a national phenomenon.

2743
02:16:15,920 --> 02:16:17,920
And then they finally got the home version.

2744
02:16:17,920 --> 02:16:20,920
It was the ugliest thing that people had ever seen.

2745
02:16:20,920 --> 02:16:21,920
It was ugly as fuck.

2746
02:16:21,920 --> 02:16:22,920
It really was.

2747
02:16:22,920 --> 02:16:23,920
Yeah.

2748
02:16:23,920 --> 02:16:27,920
But they, well they made the poor guy condense it down to like a 4K cart, even though he

2749
02:16:27,920 --> 02:16:28,920
begged to have an 8K.

2750
02:16:28,920 --> 02:16:31,920
And that's why like the ghosts flicker.

2751
02:16:31,920 --> 02:16:34,920
Because the frickin' thing can't draw the ghosts fast enough.

2752
02:16:34,920 --> 02:16:38,920
It has to actually cycle through and it draws each one in sequence.

2753
02:16:38,920 --> 02:16:39,920
And that's why they flicker so much.

2754
02:16:39,920 --> 02:16:41,920
Did that game even have fruit in it that you ate?

2755
02:16:41,920 --> 02:16:42,920
I mean, obviously it would just be like-

2756
02:16:42,920 --> 02:16:44,920
It had the wafer in the middle.

2757
02:16:44,920 --> 02:16:45,920
Oh yeah, it was like a hash.

2758
02:16:45,920 --> 02:16:46,920
Like a pound sign.

2759
02:16:46,920 --> 02:16:48,920
Yeah, it was like a wafer that you would eat.

2760
02:16:48,920 --> 02:16:49,920
So, that was it.

2761
02:16:49,920 --> 02:16:50,920
And they called it the wafer.

2762
02:16:50,920 --> 02:16:52,920
And then Ms. Pac-Man was-

2763
02:16:52,920 --> 02:16:53,920
Was much better.

2764
02:16:53,920 --> 02:16:55,920
Was very competent for what the system was.

2765
02:16:55,920 --> 02:16:56,920
Yeah, but it was also on an 8K ROM.

2766
02:16:56,920 --> 02:16:57,920
Yeah.

2767
02:16:57,920 --> 02:16:58,920
And they had the room to do it.

2768
02:16:58,920 --> 02:17:01,920
And that's kind of like what the poor guy wanted to do the first time.

2769
02:17:01,920 --> 02:17:03,920
But, you know, it's all this stuff.

2770
02:17:03,920 --> 02:17:07,920
And then you kind of read about what happened with E.T. and some of these other old games too.

2771
02:17:07,920 --> 02:17:09,920
And it's really interesting because, what's the guy's name?

2772
02:17:09,920 --> 02:17:11,920
I think it's Howard Scott Warshaw is his name?

2773
02:17:11,920 --> 02:17:13,920
The dude who made Yars' Revenge.

2774
02:17:13,920 --> 02:17:17,920
Which is easily like one of the greatest 2600 games they ever made.

2775
02:17:17,920 --> 02:17:20,920
It's completely simple, but a lot of 2600 games were.

2776
02:17:20,920 --> 02:17:22,920
It was a lot of fun.

2777
02:17:22,920 --> 02:17:25,920
That guy was brought on to make the E.T. game.

2778
02:17:25,920 --> 02:17:27,920
But he had to rush it so fast.

2779
02:17:27,920 --> 02:17:30,920
And get it out by all these aggressive deadlines and so forth.

2780
02:17:30,920 --> 02:17:33,920
That, you know, it just ended up being kind of, you know, junky.

2781
02:17:33,920 --> 02:17:35,920
And I don't think it was tested properly.

2782
02:17:35,920 --> 02:17:40,920
And he still defends that it was not as terrible of a game as everybody says it is.

2783
02:17:40,920 --> 02:17:41,920
And I don't think it was.

2784
02:17:41,920 --> 02:17:42,920
Yeah.

2785
02:17:42,920 --> 02:17:46,920
It just had a couple key design problems with it that really prevented it from being-

2786
02:17:46,920 --> 02:17:48,920
Yeah, it was hard to understand.

2787
02:17:48,920 --> 02:17:50,920
But it was playable.

2788
02:17:50,920 --> 02:17:54,920
It was probably hard for some people to figure out what you had to do.

2789
02:17:54,920 --> 02:17:57,920
It took me a while to figure out what you had to do to finish it.

2790
02:17:57,920 --> 02:17:59,920
It really does. It's not an easy game to figure out.

2791
02:17:59,920 --> 02:18:01,920
Yeah, it wasn't intuitive at all.

2792
02:18:01,920 --> 02:18:04,920
But I remember beating it and getting him onto the ship.

2793
02:18:04,920 --> 02:18:07,920
And then I think every time you do it, doesn't it get harder and harder?

2794
02:18:07,920 --> 02:18:08,920
I can't remember.

2795
02:18:08,920 --> 02:18:09,920
Yeah.

2796
02:18:09,920 --> 02:18:10,920
It probably does.

2797
02:18:10,920 --> 02:18:12,920
But when you're seven it's hard to have really discerning taste.

2798
02:18:12,920 --> 02:18:14,920
That's usually the way the Atari 2600 games work.

2799
02:18:14,920 --> 02:18:16,920
It's just the same thing over but it gets harder.

2800
02:18:16,920 --> 02:18:17,920
Yeah.

2801
02:18:17,920 --> 02:18:19,920
Okay, then the other one was about RPGs.

2802
02:18:19,920 --> 02:18:22,920
What were these? Something? No, you asked a question about RPGs.

2803
02:18:22,920 --> 02:18:25,920
That was the question that I added was not including Zelda.

2804
02:18:25,920 --> 02:18:26,920
Okay.

2805
02:18:26,920 --> 02:18:29,920
Because I think everyone- RH has played Zelda and that's more adventure.

2806
02:18:29,920 --> 02:18:32,920
But just RPG, Earthbound, Star Tropics, whatever.

2807
02:18:32,920 --> 02:18:35,920
What was the first one you invested in and finished where you saw the ending?

2808
02:18:35,920 --> 02:18:37,920
That I actually finished or that I played-

2809
02:18:37,920 --> 02:18:39,920
That you finished.

2810
02:18:39,920 --> 02:18:41,920
Adventure on the 2600.

2811
02:18:41,920 --> 02:18:42,920
Okay.

2812
02:18:42,920 --> 02:18:44,920
Okay.

2813
02:18:44,920 --> 02:18:46,920
I don't know if that's really a-

2814
02:18:46,920 --> 02:18:49,920
My friend and I stayed up all night trying to beat that shit.

2815
02:18:49,920 --> 02:18:50,920
Maybe that doesn't count.

2816
02:18:50,920 --> 02:18:52,920
Let's go one generation up then.

2817
02:18:52,920 --> 02:18:53,920
Okay.

2818
02:18:53,920 --> 02:18:54,920
For the NES.

2819
02:18:54,920 --> 02:18:55,920
I can't say Sword Quest either.

2820
02:18:55,920 --> 02:18:56,920
We didn't finish Sword Quest. It was too fucking hard.

2821
02:18:56,920 --> 02:18:57,920
Yeah.

2822
02:18:57,920 --> 02:18:59,920
On the NES.

2823
02:18:59,920 --> 02:19:03,920
I never beat Final Fantasy. Does it have liquor in it?

2824
02:19:03,920 --> 02:19:04,920
Yes.

2825
02:19:04,920 --> 02:19:05,920
I'll try it.

2826
02:19:05,920 --> 02:19:06,920
It's brandy and apple juice.

2827
02:19:06,920 --> 02:19:07,920
They can't hear you.

2828
02:19:07,920 --> 02:19:08,920
No.

2829
02:19:08,920 --> 02:19:11,920
It's brandy and apple juice.

2830
02:19:11,920 --> 02:19:13,920
It's the apple pie.

2831
02:19:13,920 --> 02:19:15,920
That is pretty fucking good.

2832
02:19:15,920 --> 02:19:16,920
Do you want me to do it?

2833
02:19:16,920 --> 02:19:18,920
Oh, I thought this was for me.

2834
02:19:18,920 --> 02:19:19,920
Oh, poor Jamie.

2835
02:19:19,920 --> 02:19:20,920
Come on, Jamie.

2836
02:19:20,920 --> 02:19:21,920
You may-

2837
02:19:21,920 --> 02:19:22,920
I've got to have a last-

2838
02:19:22,920 --> 02:19:24,920
The look on her face.

2839
02:19:24,920 --> 02:19:25,920
I'm sorry.

2840
02:19:25,920 --> 02:19:27,920
The look on her face was of such defeat.

2841
02:19:27,920 --> 02:19:32,920
Like this cross between, oh you bitch, and oh you bitch.

2842
02:19:32,920 --> 02:19:36,920
Would you like the apple or the more tequila?

2843
02:19:36,920 --> 02:19:38,920
I'll try what that is, the apple pie.

2844
02:19:38,920 --> 02:19:39,920
You want to try a sip of this?

2845
02:19:39,920 --> 02:19:40,920
See if you like it?

2846
02:19:40,920 --> 02:19:42,920
I'll like it, I'm sure.

2847
02:19:42,920 --> 02:19:43,920
Okay.

2848
02:19:43,920 --> 02:19:45,920
That's good.

2849
02:19:45,920 --> 02:19:47,920
What question were we on?

2850
02:19:47,920 --> 02:19:48,920
I'm sorry.

2851
02:19:48,920 --> 02:19:49,920
Oh, Rama.

2852
02:19:49,920 --> 02:19:50,920
I'm sorry.

2853
02:19:50,920 --> 02:19:51,920
He just like just won my heart in there.

2854
02:19:51,920 --> 02:19:55,920
Not like actually, but it's the first NES game I played was The Goonies 2.

2855
02:19:55,920 --> 02:20:00,920
That game was so underrated for its time because it was so hard.

2856
02:20:00,920 --> 02:20:02,920
Like it was so complicated, but that game is amazing.

2857
02:20:02,920 --> 02:20:09,920
I beat that game with the help of the Nintendo tip line.

2858
02:20:09,920 --> 02:20:12,920
Where it was like what, five bucks a call in what, 86, 87?

2859
02:20:12,920 --> 02:20:16,920
And I had to basically cry to my grandmother, please let me call.

2860
02:20:16,920 --> 02:20:19,920
You called that number like four times this month, all for the same game.

2861
02:20:19,920 --> 02:20:23,920
And I was like, please, you don't have to give me a Christmas present.

2862
02:20:23,920 --> 02:20:29,920
If you let me call the NES line, because that was the shit back then.

2863
02:20:29,920 --> 02:20:30,920
I never call it.

2864
02:20:30,920 --> 02:20:34,920
My mom was like, no, no, no, go to your room.

2865
02:20:34,920 --> 02:20:35,920
No.

2866
02:20:35,920 --> 02:20:37,920
Like she wouldn't budge at all.

2867
02:20:37,920 --> 02:20:41,920
Like I could be like, you know, I have an uncurable disease and the only people that

2868
02:20:41,920 --> 02:20:43,920
could cure it in Nintendo life.

2869
02:20:43,920 --> 02:20:45,920
I have to enter the Konami code to cure cancer.

2870
02:20:45,920 --> 02:20:46,920
I don't know what it is.

2871
02:20:46,920 --> 02:20:48,920
She's like, do they charge?

2872
02:20:48,920 --> 02:20:49,920
Yes.

2873
02:20:49,920 --> 02:20:50,920
Go to your room.

2874
02:20:50,920 --> 02:20:52,920
I probably could have made it a bit more.

2875
02:20:52,920 --> 02:20:55,920
So that would be her response essentially.

2876
02:20:55,920 --> 02:20:56,920
Sorry.

2877
02:20:56,920 --> 02:20:58,920
Uh, Alan's trying the-

2878
02:20:58,920 --> 02:20:59,920
We're getting boozed up right now.

2879
02:20:59,920 --> 02:21:00,920
It's really awesome.

2880
02:21:00,920 --> 02:21:02,920
Which isn't smart because I have to drive home in four hours.

2881
02:21:02,920 --> 02:21:04,920
I mean, I could sleep here, but-

2882
02:21:04,920 --> 02:21:05,920
Well, and who knows?

2883
02:21:05,920 --> 02:21:06,920
We might go long.

2884
02:21:06,920 --> 02:21:07,920
We might.

2885
02:21:07,920 --> 02:21:08,920
We'll see.

2886
02:21:08,920 --> 02:21:09,920
We'll see.

2887
02:21:09,920 --> 02:21:12,920
But, um, I was actually sort of thinking that maybe it could have used another shot of brandy.

2888
02:21:12,920 --> 02:21:13,920
I'm sorry.

2889
02:21:13,920 --> 02:21:15,920
I don't want to get too screwed up.

2890
02:21:15,920 --> 02:21:17,920
Well, Alan gets more and you don't.

2891
02:21:17,920 --> 02:21:19,920
All right.

2892
02:21:19,920 --> 02:21:20,920
Where were we?

2893
02:21:20,920 --> 02:21:22,920
Goonies 2, Nintendo tip line.

2894
02:21:22,920 --> 02:21:24,920
It was the shit, et cetera.

2895
02:21:24,920 --> 02:21:25,920
Then what?

2896
02:21:25,920 --> 02:21:28,920
What was the first game you played in roller skates?

2897
02:21:28,920 --> 02:21:29,920
The first game I played-

2898
02:21:29,920 --> 02:21:31,920
Oh, I never answered the RPG one.

2899
02:21:31,920 --> 02:21:38,920
Uh, the RPG, um, that's not Zelda.

2900
02:21:38,920 --> 02:21:40,920
I never beat Final Fantasy.

2901
02:21:40,920 --> 02:21:47,920
We got to Tiamat, the dragon guy who's like the last of the elementals, but I never-

2902
02:21:47,920 --> 02:21:52,920
I never, um, beat him.

2903
02:21:52,920 --> 02:21:56,920
I played through Dragon Warrior and I beat Dragon Warrior.

2904
02:21:56,920 --> 02:21:59,920
That was my first for that generation.

2905
02:21:59,920 --> 02:22:02,920
Yeah, cause there weren't a lot of RPGs at that time.

2906
02:22:02,920 --> 02:22:03,920
I didn't beat Ultima 3.

2907
02:22:03,920 --> 02:22:08,920
That's the first one I remember playing and that was a old school RPG.

2908
02:22:08,920 --> 02:22:10,920
That and Ultima 4, Quest of the Avatar.

2909
02:22:10,920 --> 02:22:12,920
I played the shit out of both of those games.

2910
02:22:12,920 --> 02:22:16,920
Um, and they're both really great and underrated again for the NES era.

2911
02:22:16,920 --> 02:22:20,920
Just cause they were PC translations and not everything from the PC translated well.

2912
02:22:20,920 --> 02:22:22,920
Uh, I guess it has to be Dragon Warrior.

2913
02:22:22,920 --> 02:22:26,920
I can't think of- what other RPGs were on the NES in that era?

2914
02:22:26,920 --> 02:22:31,920
Cause it feels like RPGs didn't really take off until the Super Nintendo.

2915
02:22:31,920 --> 02:22:35,920
I'm trying to remember other ones.

2916
02:22:35,920 --> 02:22:37,920
Yeah, I don't want to cause too much dead air.

2917
02:22:37,920 --> 02:22:39,920
What were some of your guys' answers? Dragon Warrior?

2918
02:22:39,920 --> 02:22:43,920
Mine were Dragon Warrior and then a few months later Final Fantasy 1.

2919
02:22:43,920 --> 02:22:45,920
Beat those.

2920
02:22:45,920 --> 02:22:48,920
And then I- there was a lot of stuff on the NES that I missed out on.

2921
02:22:48,920 --> 02:22:49,920
I never did Earthbound.

2922
02:22:49,920 --> 02:22:51,920
I never did StarTropics.

2923
02:22:51,920 --> 02:22:53,920
Earthbound wasn't really out on the NES.

2924
02:22:53,920 --> 02:22:54,920
A prototype was.

2925
02:22:54,920 --> 02:22:56,920
Earthbound came out on the Super NES later.

2926
02:22:56,920 --> 02:22:57,920
Okay.

2927
02:22:57,920 --> 02:22:58,920
It was- okay.

2928
02:22:58,920 --> 02:22:59,920
Story of Earthbound.

2929
02:22:59,920 --> 02:23:03,920
Earthbound was actually Mother 2 in Japan.

2930
02:23:03,920 --> 02:23:07,920
Mother 1 was on the NES.

2931
02:23:07,920 --> 02:23:09,920
But, um, yeah.

2932
02:23:09,920 --> 02:23:11,920
Mother 2 was on the Super Nintendo.

2933
02:23:11,920 --> 02:23:14,920
Then Mother 3 didn't come out until like just recently, right?

2934
02:23:14,920 --> 02:23:15,920
So, alright.

2935
02:23:15,920 --> 02:23:17,920
Do we need to play Chair Roulette again?

2936
02:23:17,920 --> 02:23:18,920
I'm sorry.

2937
02:23:18,920 --> 02:23:19,920
No?

2938
02:23:19,920 --> 02:23:20,920
Oh, you're baking.

2939
02:23:20,920 --> 02:23:21,920
You're baking.

2940
02:23:21,920 --> 02:23:22,920
That's right, Dark Soccer.

2941
02:23:22,920 --> 02:23:23,920
Oh, I'm gonna get baked.

2942
02:23:23,920 --> 02:23:24,920
Stop.

2943
02:23:24,920 --> 02:23:25,920
No, um.

2944
02:23:25,920 --> 02:23:28,920
Yeah, I figured I may as well stay up because it's got five more minutes left on it and

2945
02:23:28,920 --> 02:23:29,920
I'll just harass Dan.

2946
02:23:29,920 --> 02:23:30,920
Good times.

2947
02:23:30,920 --> 02:23:31,920
What pizza did you make first?

2948
02:23:31,920 --> 02:23:32,920
Uh, the pepperoni.

2949
02:23:32,920 --> 02:23:33,920
Dang.

2950
02:23:33,920 --> 02:23:34,920
Bless your heart.

2951
02:23:34,920 --> 02:23:36,920
Because I figured most of y'all are gonna eat the pepperoni.

2952
02:23:36,920 --> 02:23:38,920
I can cook my chicken one next, so.

2953
02:23:38,920 --> 02:23:39,920
Alright.

2954
02:23:39,920 --> 02:23:40,920
Good times.

2955
02:23:40,920 --> 02:23:41,920
And then the veggie.

2956
02:23:41,920 --> 02:23:44,920
I'll have a piece of the chicken one, I guess, if the pepperoni goes real fast.

2957
02:23:44,920 --> 02:23:45,920
Okay.

2958
02:23:45,920 --> 02:23:48,920
Uh, and then you started to ask, what was the first game I played in roller skates?

2959
02:23:48,920 --> 02:23:51,920
Uh, the local roller ring near us had Spy Hunter.

2960
02:23:51,920 --> 02:23:52,920
And it was a stand-up cabinet.

2961
02:23:52,920 --> 02:23:54,920
And it was the kind where you actually had the drive pedal.

2962
02:23:54,920 --> 02:23:57,920
Yes, I would use the roller skates on the drive pedal.

2963
02:23:57,920 --> 02:24:00,920
I would say it was probably that or Air Hockey.

2964
02:24:00,920 --> 02:24:01,920
Good old Roller King.

2965
02:24:01,920 --> 02:24:03,920
It's still there out in Roseville.

2966
02:24:03,920 --> 02:24:04,920
That's right by where I grew up.

2967
02:24:04,920 --> 02:24:05,920
I said his first was Gauntlet.

2968
02:24:05,920 --> 02:24:07,920
Dan says his first was Gauntlet.

2969
02:24:07,920 --> 02:24:08,920
When's Dan gonna be on the show?

2970
02:24:08,920 --> 02:24:11,920
Is Dan gonna come be on OLR?

2971
02:24:11,920 --> 02:24:13,920
The game that should not be named.

2972
02:24:13,920 --> 02:24:14,920
Alright.

2973
02:24:14,920 --> 02:24:16,920
Is that it for Ask Orange Launch?

2974
02:24:16,920 --> 02:24:17,920
Half of my drink.

2975
02:24:17,920 --> 02:24:20,920
Someone asked if we could play Name That Tune.

2976
02:24:20,920 --> 02:24:21,920
And then I think.

2977
02:24:21,920 --> 02:24:22,920
Oh yeah.

2978
02:24:22,920 --> 02:24:23,920
Danny was like.

2979
02:24:23,920 --> 02:24:24,920
Dark Tootsie's been begging me for that all week.

2980
02:24:24,920 --> 02:24:26,920
I didn't really set it up in advance.

2981
02:24:26,920 --> 02:24:28,920
I'm sorry.

2982
02:24:28,920 --> 02:24:30,920
And I don't even remember how the rules to that go.

2983
02:24:30,920 --> 02:24:33,920
I mean, I could see.

2984
02:24:33,920 --> 02:24:34,920
Yeah, we want to do match game and list list.

2985
02:24:34,920 --> 02:24:35,920
But I have to set those up too.

2986
02:24:35,920 --> 02:24:38,920
So we'll, we'll play with that later.

2987
02:24:38,920 --> 02:24:41,920
Well, how about, um, when I change out the pizzas?

2988
02:24:41,920 --> 02:24:42,920
Mm-hmm.

2989
02:24:42,920 --> 02:24:46,920
We can do the rest of the questions that are on our list for discussion topics.

2990
02:24:46,920 --> 02:24:47,920
Okay.

2991
02:24:47,920 --> 02:24:55,920
Actually, I'll tell you what, since really the rest of it was on there for you and Alan.

2992
02:24:55,920 --> 02:24:59,920
How about you guys go ahead and do your, your thing?

2993
02:24:59,920 --> 02:25:00,920
Oh yeah.

2994
02:25:00,920 --> 02:25:01,920
Let's get in there.

2995
02:25:01,920 --> 02:25:02,920
Well, there were a couple of news stories too.

2996
02:25:02,920 --> 02:25:05,920
Do we want to cover those?

2997
02:25:05,920 --> 02:25:07,920
There was one about, one about Telltale.

2998
02:25:07,920 --> 02:25:08,920
Did you want to?

2999
02:25:08,920 --> 02:25:10,920
Why don't we just do those after I'm done with pizza?

3000
02:25:10,920 --> 02:25:11,920
Later?

3001
02:25:11,920 --> 02:25:12,920
Okay, that's fine.

3002
02:25:12,920 --> 02:25:13,920
Not like we don't have All Night Rob.

3003
02:25:13,920 --> 02:25:14,920
Okay.

3004
02:25:14,920 --> 02:25:17,920
So Alan and I wanted to do our own classic games of the week and I want to let Bradley

3005
02:25:17,920 --> 02:25:18,920
do one of these too.

3006
02:25:18,920 --> 02:25:19,920
And I didn't know he was going to be here tonight.

3007
02:25:19,920 --> 02:25:22,920
So, um, Alan and I are doing our own classic games of the week.

3008
02:25:22,920 --> 02:25:26,920
We're taking over this segment because, um, you know, we wanted to have a longer show

3009
02:25:26,920 --> 02:25:28,920
tonight and, uh, we're kind of jealous.

3010
02:25:28,920 --> 02:25:29,920
The dark soccer always gets this segment.

3011
02:25:29,920 --> 02:25:31,920
I mean, don't you get jealous of her?

3012
02:25:31,920 --> 02:25:34,920
Alan, don't you want to be just like her?

3013
02:25:34,920 --> 02:25:43,920
So we have our own little classic game of the week segment.

3014
02:25:43,920 --> 02:25:47,920
Breakman's asking, when are they going to play truth or dare?

3015
02:25:47,920 --> 02:25:50,920
Um, you're gonna have to get me drunk in a minute.

3016
02:25:50,920 --> 02:25:51,920
All right.

3017
02:25:51,920 --> 02:25:53,920
Our own classic games of the week.

3018
02:25:53,920 --> 02:25:55,920
Alan, you want to start first?

3019
02:25:55,920 --> 02:25:57,920
What'd you pick as your classic game of the week?

3020
02:25:57,920 --> 02:26:02,920
I would love to have a, to take a minute to refamiliarize myself with the Wikipedia article

3021
02:26:02,920 --> 02:26:03,920
on it.

3022
02:26:03,920 --> 02:26:04,920
So can you go first?

3023
02:26:04,920 --> 02:26:05,920
Yes, I can.

3024
02:26:05,920 --> 02:26:06,920
I can.

3025
02:26:06,920 --> 02:26:08,920
Because you asked so kindly, I will go first and my classic game of the week.

3026
02:26:08,920 --> 02:26:09,920
Okay.

3027
02:26:09,920 --> 02:26:11,920
The music to this like sucks, but, um, deal.

3028
02:26:11,920 --> 02:26:12,920
Okay.

3029
02:26:12,920 --> 02:26:16,920
So I have picked a game that was on the PC a while ago, and it was, you're going to hear

3030
02:26:16,920 --> 02:26:18,920
this awesome, like ad lib noise in the background.

3031
02:26:18,920 --> 02:26:21,920
Cause it used like the ad lib card to make noise.

3032
02:26:21,920 --> 02:26:24,920
It was a game called Lexi Cross.

3033
02:26:24,920 --> 02:26:27,920
Um, Lexi Cross was like, there's like no music.

3034
02:26:27,920 --> 02:26:29,920
It just has the ambient noise to it.

3035
02:26:29,920 --> 02:26:32,920
Lexi Cross was like a futuristic game show that was on the PC.

3036
02:26:32,920 --> 02:26:35,920
Let me actually fast forward to some actual gameplay.

3037
02:26:35,920 --> 02:26:39,920
Um, you're just going to hear that vroom, vroom noise like a million times.

3038
02:26:39,920 --> 02:26:41,920
Cause that was most of the music in the game.

3039
02:26:41,920 --> 02:26:45,920
But basically what would happen is it was a two player futuristic game show.

3040
02:26:45,920 --> 02:26:50,920
And on each side of the board, you would have these, all these monitors or tiles that you

3041
02:26:50,920 --> 02:26:53,920
would have your little robot Vanna White that you moved around the screen and she could

3042
02:26:53,920 --> 02:26:54,920
reveal the tiles.

3043
02:26:54,920 --> 02:26:58,920
But if you hit a blank square, your turn would be over.

3044
02:26:58,920 --> 02:27:03,920
But if you hit a silver square that was, you know, part of the crossword puzzle, then you

3045
02:27:03,920 --> 02:27:04,920
could keep going.

3046
02:27:04,920 --> 02:27:11,920
So it was like this entire crossword puzzle was hidden underneath, um, this entire crossword

3047
02:27:11,920 --> 02:27:14,920
puzzle was hidden underneath, uh, the boards.

3048
02:27:14,920 --> 02:27:16,920
And there'd be all these special types of spaces.

3049
02:27:16,920 --> 02:27:17,920
There'd be plus money.

3050
02:27:17,920 --> 02:27:18,920
There'd be lose money.

3051
02:27:18,920 --> 02:27:20,920
There'd be vowel spaces.

3052
02:27:20,920 --> 02:27:27,920
There'd be, uh, look at a, uh, look at an entire row or an entire column really fast.

3053
02:27:27,920 --> 02:27:29,920
Like you'd get to peak for five seconds.

3054
02:27:29,920 --> 02:27:31,920
So you could kind of memorize where the tiles were.

3055
02:27:31,920 --> 02:27:36,920
Um, and at the end of the day, you would, you could spin the wheel was another option.

3056
02:27:36,920 --> 02:27:39,920
When you feel you've revealed enough tiles on the board, you could spin the wheel for

3057
02:27:39,920 --> 02:27:40,920
money.

3058
02:27:40,920 --> 02:27:41,920
And it kind of worked like wheel of fortune.

3059
02:27:41,920 --> 02:27:46,920
And once you revealed all the letters on the board, they would all kind of add up to what

3060
02:27:46,920 --> 02:27:47,920
the answer was.

3061
02:27:47,920 --> 02:27:52,920
Like all the words in the crossword had something to do with the, like if I fast forward way

3062
02:27:52,920 --> 02:27:56,920
ahead in this video here, where they actually start spinning for letters that they ever

3063
02:27:56,920 --> 02:27:57,920
do.

3064
02:27:57,920 --> 02:28:02,420
I think this guy probably runs out of time at some point, but he's spinning the wheel

3065
02:28:02,420 --> 02:28:03,680
here.

3066
02:28:03,680 --> 02:28:08,960
At some point, so many letters will be revealed that, um, they'll all have something in common.

3067
02:28:08,960 --> 02:28:16,440
Like maybe they're all, you know, places, uh, in Hawaii, or they're all quotes, you

3068
02:28:16,440 --> 02:28:18,560
know, from Shakespeare or something characters.

3069
02:28:18,560 --> 02:28:20,800
So that's kind of what you have to figure out there.

3070
02:28:20,800 --> 02:28:26,560
So it's a cool little, uh, old school game show and is, um, I don't know if you can even

3071
02:28:26,560 --> 02:28:29,360
download that, like on good old games or anything like that.

3072
02:28:29,360 --> 02:28:35,280
Like I doubt it's available anywhere like that, but, um, it's still out there on probably

3073
02:28:35,280 --> 02:28:37,080
abandonware sites and good stuff like that.

3074
02:28:37,080 --> 02:28:40,480
But there was copy protection in the manual that actually came with a little TV guide

3075
02:28:40,480 --> 02:28:42,720
parody that actually was the copy protection.

3076
02:28:42,720 --> 02:28:46,000
You had to know like what was on page seven, you remember old school, poppy protection

3077
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:47,000
on PC games.

3078
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:48,000
Like, yeah.

3079
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:49,000
Yeah.

3080
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:51,540
I remember playing leisure suit Larry at my friend's house and Ross having to, and also

3081
02:28:51,540 --> 02:28:56,640
King's quest, having to dig through the, um, manual to find the right word.

3082
02:28:56,640 --> 02:28:57,640
Oh yeah.

3083
02:28:57,640 --> 02:28:58,640
You know what it was?

3084
02:28:58,640 --> 02:29:01,660
The copy protection was like, what is on channel such and such at seven o'clock.

3085
02:29:01,660 --> 02:29:05,240
Cause that's like what was in the TV guide was, you know, it was like a programming list.

3086
02:29:05,240 --> 02:29:08,680
Uh, I'm reading in the Wikipedia article on this.

3087
02:29:08,680 --> 02:29:10,080
It came out in 1991.

3088
02:29:10,080 --> 02:29:12,000
It was by inner play.

3089
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:16,640
Inner play made some other awesome, uh, old school PC games in the early nineties and

3090
02:29:16,640 --> 02:29:17,640
stuff.

3091
02:29:17,640 --> 02:29:18,640
I think they finally shut down in 2000.

3092
02:29:18,640 --> 02:29:19,640
What did they make?

3093
02:29:19,640 --> 02:29:23,200
Um, did they make MDK?

3094
02:29:23,200 --> 02:29:24,200
They made that.

3095
02:29:24,200 --> 02:29:26,840
They made, um, Bard's tail.

3096
02:29:26,840 --> 02:29:29,920
They're the guys that made Bard's tail good times.

3097
02:29:29,920 --> 02:29:31,780
Descent was also them.

3098
02:29:31,780 --> 02:29:35,720
So they had a lot of good stuff and they say it's a combination of wheel of fortune, scrabble

3099
02:29:35,720 --> 02:29:36,720
and battleship.

3100
02:29:36,720 --> 02:29:39,980
And that's a pretty good, pretty good combination.

3101
02:29:39,980 --> 02:29:43,680
The words eventually comprise a theme or a quotation, which the player must guess to

3102
02:29:43,680 --> 02:29:44,680
win the game.

3103
02:29:44,680 --> 02:29:45,960
So that's it a game show.

3104
02:29:45,960 --> 02:29:46,960
Go figure.

3105
02:29:46,960 --> 02:29:47,960
I picked a game show.

3106
02:29:47,960 --> 02:29:50,920
It's called the classic game of the week, but Lexi cross definitely an under looked

3107
02:29:50,920 --> 02:29:51,920
classic.

3108
02:29:51,920 --> 02:29:54,760
All right, Alan, you already, I am all right.

3109
02:29:54,760 --> 02:29:55,760
Oh, clay fighter.

3110
02:29:55,760 --> 02:29:57,280
Dark Tetsuya reminds us in chat.

3111
02:29:57,280 --> 02:29:58,280
Interplay did make clay fighter.

3112
02:29:58,280 --> 02:30:00,200
Let's play the music one more time.

3113
02:30:00,200 --> 02:30:01,200
I like this so much.

3114
02:30:01,200 --> 02:30:02,840
I want to do the classic game all over again.

3115
02:30:02,840 --> 02:30:04,760
Alan, what is your classic game of the week?

3116
02:30:04,760 --> 02:30:10,600
Well, for those of us who grew up playing Sierra online games, whether it be space quest,

3117
02:30:10,600 --> 02:30:16,120
King's quest or police quest, uh, often, uh, came across one of their lesser talked about

3118
02:30:16,120 --> 02:30:20,240
series, the quest for glory franchise.

3119
02:30:20,240 --> 02:30:27,440
And my pick is quest for glory to trial by fire came out in November of 1990.

3120
02:30:27,440 --> 02:30:30,480
Oh, this guy's talking through his thing here.

3121
02:30:30,480 --> 02:30:31,480
Sorry.

3122
02:30:31,480 --> 02:30:34,280
I gotta try to find some gameplay of this.

3123
02:30:34,280 --> 02:30:37,640
I don't know if there's anything where the guy's not talking.

3124
02:30:37,640 --> 02:30:40,480
You found the one earlier that had the, he was talking.

3125
02:30:40,480 --> 02:30:44,120
We didn't listen to the, let me see.

3126
02:30:44,120 --> 02:30:45,120
Okay.

3127
02:30:45,120 --> 02:30:48,120
Let's, uh, look at the introduction.

3128
02:30:48,120 --> 02:30:49,120
See, we didn't hear this earlier.

3129
02:30:49,120 --> 02:30:50,120
Did we?

3130
02:30:50,120 --> 02:30:51,120
I don't think so.

3131
02:30:51,120 --> 02:30:54,800
I don't want to hear this jerk talk over the game.

3132
02:30:54,800 --> 02:31:00,200
So quest for glory one had a traditional medieval English theme to it.

3133
02:31:00,200 --> 02:31:05,640
And at the end of the game, after the closing credits, a, your friend comes by on a flying

3134
02:31:05,640 --> 02:31:10,480
carpet and it's sort of a cliffhanger ending and he swoops the hero up on his flying carpet

3135
02:31:10,480 --> 02:31:12,560
and they fly away.

3136
02:31:12,560 --> 02:31:18,960
And when they land in quest for glory two, they are in Shapir, which is sort of a Persian,

3137
02:31:18,960 --> 02:31:22,280
you know, thousand and one Arabian nights styled game.

3138
02:31:22,280 --> 02:31:25,680
It is, um, out of King's quest and space quest.

3139
02:31:25,680 --> 02:31:28,480
It's more traditionally in RPG.

3140
02:31:28,480 --> 02:31:34,800
Um, those games are mostly about their puzzle solving and, um, the narrative, but quest

3141
02:31:34,800 --> 02:31:37,120
for glory actually had classes.

3142
02:31:37,120 --> 02:31:39,880
You could be a thief, mage, or warrior.

3143
02:31:39,880 --> 02:31:41,440
I did play this game.

3144
02:31:41,440 --> 02:31:42,440
Oh my God.

3145
02:31:42,440 --> 02:31:43,440
It was good.

3146
02:31:43,440 --> 02:31:44,440
Oh my God.

3147
02:31:44,440 --> 02:31:45,440
This game was awesome.

3148
02:31:45,440 --> 02:31:48,000
Depending on trigger until you said that I was like, I remember.

3149
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:49,000
Yeah.

3150
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:50,000
You could be the different classes.

3151
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:54,840
And, uh, you could import your save file from part one so you could keep the same character

3152
02:31:54,840 --> 02:31:58,760
name and stats that you had at the end of the first one, which was a big deal at the

3153
02:31:58,760 --> 02:31:59,760
time.

3154
02:31:59,760 --> 02:32:05,320
Um, there's a puzzle towards the end of the game where you had to knock over these candles

3155
02:32:05,320 --> 02:32:10,120
because if the candles got lit, this evil ritual would complete.

3156
02:32:10,120 --> 02:32:13,760
So if you were a mage, you'd cast a magic missile or if you were a thief, you would

3157
02:32:13,760 --> 02:32:16,040
throw your knives.

3158
02:32:16,040 --> 02:32:19,840
So whatever class you were sort of affected how you solve the puzzles.

3159
02:32:19,840 --> 02:32:26,400
Um, it's about an evil vizier who wanted to raise a genie, the genie Iblis.

3160
02:32:26,400 --> 02:32:34,120
Um, and the game took place over the course of 30 days in game time.

3161
02:32:34,120 --> 02:32:38,880
So if you couldn't figure out how to, how to solve a puzzle for a certain day and your

3162
02:32:38,880 --> 02:32:43,800
character was tired, you would go to the end and type sleep and go to sleep and you'd wake

3163
02:32:43,800 --> 02:32:47,000
up and then you had to go out on a fresh clog.

3164
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:51,960
It'd be 7 AM and you'd go out and you'd try to solve the puzzles again.

3165
02:32:51,960 --> 02:32:56,360
And you had to, you had to wrap up the game within 30 days of game time.

3166
02:32:56,360 --> 02:33:01,320
And the big deal about this game is that if you were super polite and you did all of the

3167
02:33:01,320 --> 02:33:06,880
optional side quests at the end, once you beat the game, you would discover that you

3168
02:33:06,880 --> 02:33:10,760
would unlock the Paladin career path.

3169
02:33:10,760 --> 02:33:14,840
And when you saved your game file and loaded it into Quest for Glory 3, you would be a

3170
02:33:14,840 --> 02:33:20,560
Paladin and that you could unlock that depending on, um, it didn't matter if you were a thief

3171
02:33:20,560 --> 02:33:23,680
or really important interruption, you'll eat veggie, right?

3172
02:33:23,680 --> 02:33:24,680
Yes.

3173
02:33:24,680 --> 02:33:25,680
Okay.

3174
02:33:25,680 --> 02:33:28,720
They're all getting their pizza while I talk about this game.

3175
02:33:28,720 --> 02:33:39,080
Um, so yeah, it, Quest for Glory came along pretty late in the EGA text based adventure

3176
02:33:39,080 --> 02:33:41,880
game era of Sierra.

3177
02:33:41,880 --> 02:33:46,480
Only the first two had EGA graphics and were completely text driven.

3178
02:33:46,480 --> 02:33:54,080
Well, I mean, as far as entering the commands Quest for Glory 3, which had a more African

3179
02:33:54,080 --> 02:34:00,600
slash Mayan, um, setting to it was had by then adapted to VGA graphics and the mouse

3180
02:34:00,600 --> 02:34:07,200
cursor where you click on look or touch, and then that's how you interacted with the puzzles.

3181
02:34:07,200 --> 02:34:13,640
So yeah, I played this game all through eighth grade and, uh, freshman year of high school

3182
02:34:13,640 --> 02:34:16,160
and it is super awesome.

3183
02:34:16,160 --> 02:34:21,240
And it's one of the few franchises that, um, people often overlook when talking about the

3184
02:34:21,240 --> 02:34:24,480
glory of, um, Sierra Onlines.

3185
02:34:24,480 --> 02:34:29,280
That's true because most people remember Leisure Zuleri and King's Quest, especially the fourth

3186
02:34:29,280 --> 02:34:30,280
one.

3187
02:34:30,280 --> 02:34:31,280
Yeah.

3188
02:34:31,280 --> 02:34:32,280
But usually this one gets overlooked that and Space Quest.

3189
02:34:32,280 --> 02:34:33,280
Yeah.

3190
02:34:33,280 --> 02:34:37,880
So yeah, the fact that you could, um, start with Quest for Glory one and use the same

3191
02:34:37,880 --> 02:34:43,040
save file, the same character sheet all through Quest for Glory five, which I owned, but I

3192
02:34:43,040 --> 02:34:49,200
never played because it was very, it Quest for Glory five came out and I think the mid

3193
02:34:49,200 --> 02:34:53,400
nineties, late nineties when adventure games were dead, no one cared, no one was doing

3194
02:34:53,400 --> 02:34:54,480
them anymore.

3195
02:34:54,480 --> 02:34:59,800
So it was very buggy and broken and I never really finished it, but this one out of the

3196
02:34:59,800 --> 02:35:02,920
out of the original classics, part two is definitely the best.

3197
02:35:02,920 --> 02:35:04,320
All right.

3198
02:35:04,320 --> 02:35:07,520
What was it about two that made you love it the most?

3199
02:35:07,520 --> 02:35:14,040
Just the music, the atmosphere, um, it basically took everything that was in one and just made

3200
02:35:14,040 --> 02:35:16,720
it better like a sequel should.

3201
02:35:16,720 --> 02:35:20,520
Derek H and Chad asked a good question, what happened to Roberta Williams?

3202
02:35:20,520 --> 02:35:24,400
Didn't she kind of, I don't know, she wasn't happy with the way the gaming culture was

3203
02:35:24,400 --> 02:35:25,400
going, right?

3204
02:35:25,400 --> 02:35:28,120
Like she wasn't a fan of consoles, if I'm not mistaken.

3205
02:35:28,120 --> 02:35:33,200
The last thing that she really consulted on, I want to say was Quest for Glory, was Quest

3206
02:35:33,200 --> 02:35:39,600
for Glory eight, which had this guy in it that wasn't from, from the, um, King Graham

3207
02:35:39,600 --> 02:35:41,080
and Daventry and all of that.

3208
02:35:41,080 --> 02:35:46,840
It was very ugly, clunky, 3d adventure game with like real time combat.

3209
02:35:46,840 --> 02:35:47,840
It was awful.

3210
02:35:47,840 --> 02:35:50,280
That King's Quest, Mask of Eternity.

3211
02:35:50,280 --> 02:35:53,040
That was the last thing that she sort of consulted on.

3212
02:35:53,040 --> 02:36:01,080
But um, after that, I think Sierra went bankrupt because adventure gaming was over and real

3213
02:36:01,080 --> 02:36:03,320
quick, I'm looking at a Wikipedia article on her.

3214
02:36:03,320 --> 02:36:04,320
She also made Phantasmagoria.

3215
02:36:04,320 --> 02:36:09,000
Remember, it was also courting into her run across seven discs.

3216
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:10,000
Yeah.

3217
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:11,000
Epic.

3218
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:14,440
She was hired in 1998 and she's kind of stayed away from the public eye.

3219
02:36:14,440 --> 02:36:17,440
She really doesn't want to give interviews ever to talk about it, but she did talk about

3220
02:36:17,440 --> 02:36:23,660
it in 2006 and she said that the, her favorite game that she ever created was Phantasmagoria,

3221
02:36:23,660 --> 02:36:24,720
not King's Quest.

3222
02:36:24,720 --> 02:36:28,600
She said, quote, if I could pick only one game, I would pick Phantasmagoria as I've

3223
02:36:28,600 --> 02:36:33,000
always enjoyed working on it immensely and it was so very challenging and I love to be

3224
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:34,000
challenged.

3225
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:36,960
However, in my heart, I will always love the King's Quest series and especially King's

3226
02:36:36,960 --> 02:36:42,560
Quest ones, it was the game that really made Sierra online.

3227
02:36:42,560 --> 02:36:46,840
I have to say before I go out and check on the pizza again, Phantasmagoria was amazing.

3228
02:36:46,840 --> 02:36:47,840
The end.

3229
02:36:47,840 --> 02:36:48,840
It was.

3230
02:36:48,840 --> 02:36:49,840
It was awesome.

3231
02:36:49,840 --> 02:36:52,200
So many epic like FMVs and stuff.

3232
02:36:52,200 --> 02:36:55,940
Roberta Williams also went on to say that she said that her games are explicitly targeted

3233
02:36:55,940 --> 02:37:01,000
towards a more affluent and educated audience and it actually made people kind of criticize

3234
02:37:01,000 --> 02:37:05,320
her that she was kind of an elitist, but she did sum up her feelings in 99 with an interview

3235
02:37:05,320 --> 02:37:09,760
on Gamers Depot, quote, back when I got started, which sounds like ancient history, back then

3236
02:37:09,760 --> 02:37:13,160
the demographics of people who were into computer games was totally different in my opinion

3237
02:37:13,160 --> 02:37:14,440
than they are today.

3238
02:37:14,440 --> 02:37:17,920
Back then, computers were more expensive, which made them more exclusive to people who

3239
02:37:17,920 --> 02:37:20,640
were maybe at a certain income level or education level.

3240
02:37:20,640 --> 02:37:23,940
So the people who played computer games 15 years ago were that type of person.

3241
02:37:23,940 --> 02:37:27,440
They probably didn't watch television as much and the instant gratification era hadn't quite

3242
02:37:27,440 --> 02:37:28,880
grown the way it has lately.

3243
02:37:28,880 --> 02:37:32,320
I think in the last five or six years, the demographics have really changed.

3244
02:37:32,320 --> 02:37:36,280
Now this is my opinion because computers are less expensive so more people can afford them.

3245
02:37:36,280 --> 02:37:38,800
More average people now feel they should own one.

3246
02:37:38,800 --> 02:37:48,320
Yeah, well back in 1987, 88, 89, if you had a computer with EGA graphics, a 20 meg hard

3247
02:37:48,320 --> 02:37:53,800
drive with 512K RAM, that was like four or five grand.

3248
02:37:53,800 --> 02:37:59,920
Like you were loaded if you had a IBM desktop with color back then.

3249
02:37:59,920 --> 02:38:00,920
Oh yeah.

3250
02:38:00,920 --> 02:38:01,920
Oh yeah.

3251
02:38:01,920 --> 02:38:02,920
That would be really well off.

3252
02:38:02,920 --> 02:38:08,600
I want to say our first Packard Bell was like a 386SX16 or something and it was like a $2,000

3253
02:38:08,600 --> 02:38:09,600
computer.

3254
02:38:09,600 --> 02:38:10,600
Yeah.

3255
02:38:10,600 --> 02:38:14,040
It was very expensive.

3256
02:38:14,040 --> 02:38:18,360
By the way, also Roberta Williams said in a 2006 interview that designing computer games

3257
02:38:18,360 --> 02:38:24,600
is in the past for her now, but she does want to write a historical novel someday.

3258
02:38:24,600 --> 02:38:26,960
So there you go.

3259
02:38:26,960 --> 02:38:27,960
That's awesome.

3260
02:38:27,960 --> 02:38:32,280
She's actually on the cover of Soft Porn Adventure by Online Systems.

3261
02:38:32,280 --> 02:38:33,520
She's actually on the cover.

3262
02:38:33,520 --> 02:38:35,680
That is crazy.

3263
02:38:35,680 --> 02:38:36,920
How funny.

3264
02:38:36,920 --> 02:38:45,340
I almost chose Leisure Suit Larry 3 for my pick because aside from the whole EGA boobies,

3265
02:38:45,340 --> 02:38:49,720
it's an incredibly difficult and fun adventure game.

3266
02:38:49,720 --> 02:38:52,240
Very cool.

3267
02:38:52,240 --> 02:38:57,440
Also her last game she's credited with is King's Quest Mask of Eternity in 98, which

3268
02:38:57,440 --> 02:39:00,960
I'm assuming is King's Quest VIII, which was the last official King's Quest game.

3269
02:39:00,960 --> 02:39:01,960
It was awful.

3270
02:39:01,960 --> 02:39:02,960
Yeah.

3271
02:39:02,960 --> 02:39:07,480
I wonder in what capacity she worked on that game because that was three years after Phantasmagoria

3272
02:39:07,480 --> 02:39:17,160
in 95 and she didn't do anything in Phantasmagoria 2.

3273
02:39:17,160 --> 02:39:18,160
There you go.

3274
02:39:18,160 --> 02:39:19,160
All right.

3275
02:39:19,160 --> 02:39:25,360
That was kind of a nice little derivative there to talk about that.

3276
02:39:25,360 --> 02:39:27,280
I think we'll go ahead and kind of take a quick break.

3277
02:39:27,280 --> 02:39:30,080
You'll give us a chance to eat here and get the other pizza done.

3278
02:39:30,080 --> 02:39:33,240
We're going to just play a little bit of music, save this part of the show we have done so

3279
02:39:33,240 --> 02:39:34,240
far.

3280
02:39:34,240 --> 02:39:35,240
We're going to take a quick break, guys.

3281
02:39:35,240 --> 02:39:36,440
When we come back, we'll do more of your questions.

3282
02:39:36,440 --> 02:39:40,040
We'll do more calls too and a couple more stories for you guys as well when we come

3283
02:39:40,040 --> 02:39:44,800
back with the Orange Lounge Radio Marathon live here at All Games Radio.

3284
02:39:44,800 --> 02:39:59,480
We'll be right back.
