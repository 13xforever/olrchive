00:00.000 --> 00:19.320
Today, September 5th, 2010, the 360 is set to get a new controller.

00:19.320 --> 00:23.720
News from PAX includes the return of a long forgotten game franchise, and could comic

00:23.720 --> 00:32.280
books be coming to the PS3?

00:32.280 --> 00:36.960
Hello everybody out there on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge

00:36.960 --> 00:37.960
Radio.

00:37.960 --> 00:43.880
We are that show where every gamer has a voice, and joining you over the next several, many,

00:43.880 --> 00:45.160
long hours.

00:45.160 --> 00:49.240
My name is Rob Roberts, sometimes going by Skye in our chatroom and so forth.

00:49.240 --> 00:52.840
Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

00:52.840 --> 00:53.840
Hi.

00:53.840 --> 00:54.840
How are you?

00:54.840 --> 00:56.440
I'm on podcast number two for the day.

00:56.440 --> 00:58.040
I know, yes.

00:58.040 --> 01:01.480
You're having quite the podcasting day, but we'll get to that in a minute.

01:01.480 --> 01:05.200
But we also have to introduce the one and only tech master, Loki.

01:05.200 --> 01:06.200
Hello.

01:06.200 --> 01:07.200
How are you?

01:07.200 --> 01:08.200
I'm good.

01:08.200 --> 01:10.200
I made an observation this morning, I was trying to confirm.

01:10.200 --> 01:11.960
What is that?

01:11.960 --> 01:16.300
I don't know if anybody remembers the guy, Reginald Vell-Johnson.

01:16.300 --> 01:17.300
You may remember him.

01:17.300 --> 01:18.300
Was he the dad on Family Matters?

01:18.300 --> 01:19.560
He was the dad on Family Matters.

01:19.560 --> 01:20.560
Oh!

01:20.560 --> 01:23.080
Dude, I'm a pop culture sponge!

01:23.080 --> 01:28.120
Anyways, I was watching Ghostbusters today because they were playing it on Comedy Central,

01:28.120 --> 01:29.120
and he was a cop in that.

01:29.120 --> 01:33.760
I'm like, how many fucking movies and shows has he been a damn police officer in?

01:33.760 --> 01:37.320
Because he's always a goddamn police officer in everything.

01:37.320 --> 01:38.880
Quite a few, actually.

01:38.880 --> 01:43.320
Die Hard 1, Die Hard 2, and Ghostbusters, as well as Family Matters.

01:43.320 --> 01:47.720
And of course I'd have to go through the rest of these to figure out which ones of these

01:47.720 --> 01:51.000
he's actually a police officer, but it just has his name on there.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
But it's just weird.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
Orange Round Studio.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
Talk about...

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
I know, what has he done lately?

01:55.000 --> 01:58.360
Can we get him on the show, maybe, to do some voiceovers?

01:58.360 --> 02:01.440
He was also in Die Hard Vendetta, the video game, as his character.

02:01.440 --> 02:02.440
Oh, hey!

02:02.440 --> 02:03.440
Oh, bringing it back to games.

02:03.440 --> 02:04.440
There you go.

02:04.440 --> 02:05.440
Love it.

02:05.440 --> 02:06.440
Alright.

02:06.440 --> 02:07.440
Over the next many hours, we are going to be talking about video games.

02:07.440 --> 02:11.880
Look, it is a, if you haven't heard, it's a special episode today, tonight, and so forth.

02:11.880 --> 02:15.700
We decided that, and I don't know why we decided this, it was really just one of those kind

02:15.700 --> 02:19.520
of random things, because we like to do that around here, that we're going to broadcast

02:19.520 --> 02:21.520
as long as we can today.

02:21.520 --> 02:24.440
We're actually having an early start, so we are live at All Games Radio.

02:24.440 --> 02:29.280
We do tape live every Sunday at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, right after the Bobby

02:29.280 --> 02:31.000
Black Wolf show, usually.

02:31.000 --> 02:34.560
But today it's 2 o'clock Pacific, 5 o'clock Eastern, and we're starting to show a little

02:34.560 --> 02:35.880
bit early, because the plan is...

02:35.880 --> 02:37.020
It's 10 o'clock in England.

02:37.020 --> 02:38.680
We're going to go, yeah, 10 at night.

02:38.680 --> 02:41.960
So finally we're getting kind of an earlier show in for them, so I hope some folks overseas

02:41.960 --> 02:43.680
are listening too.

02:43.680 --> 02:47.120
But we're going to actually try to go late tonight.

02:47.120 --> 02:48.380
I don't know how late.

02:48.380 --> 02:50.680
The goal is midnight.

02:50.680 --> 02:52.120
We might go longer.

02:52.120 --> 02:53.600
We might go not as long.

02:53.600 --> 02:55.660
I don't know, but we'll see.

02:55.660 --> 02:57.480
So we're doing the marathon episode.

02:57.480 --> 02:58.480
Why?

02:58.480 --> 02:59.480
Because we can.

02:59.480 --> 03:00.900
Why not?

03:00.900 --> 03:02.920
It's not, it's not a fundraiser for anything.

03:02.920 --> 03:06.920
I mean, you should donate to charities, you know, do good in your life, that, but we're

03:06.920 --> 03:11.320
just doing this for fun, because everybody else is at some freaking convention this weekend,

03:11.320 --> 03:14.480
so we're having a little mini festival of our own.

03:14.480 --> 03:17.440
We do have some guests joining us in the studio here today.

03:17.440 --> 03:19.160
I don't know how long they'll be with us.

03:19.160 --> 03:20.780
I think he'll be with us the whole time.

03:20.780 --> 03:23.760
Say hello to Salacious Pop or Alan.

03:23.760 --> 03:24.760
Hello.

03:24.760 --> 03:25.760
How are you?

03:25.760 --> 03:26.760
Much better than last time.

03:26.760 --> 03:27.760
Really?

03:27.760 --> 03:28.760
What was wrong last time?

03:28.760 --> 03:29.760
I had food poisoning when I was on the show.

03:29.760 --> 03:30.760
Oh, that's right.

03:30.760 --> 03:32.400
You were recovering from the Reno trip.

03:32.400 --> 03:33.400
Yes.

03:33.400 --> 03:34.400
But you're feeling much better today.

03:34.400 --> 03:35.400
Yes.

03:35.400 --> 03:36.400
All right.

03:36.400 --> 03:37.960
Yeah, I was a little worried about that, because we're doing this marathon today.

03:37.960 --> 03:40.040
We didn't really plan it out very well.

03:40.040 --> 03:42.880
It's just like, hey, let's broadcast for 12 hours.

03:42.880 --> 03:43.880
Okay.

03:43.880 --> 03:46.680
You know, oh, when are we going to eat?

03:46.680 --> 03:47.680
So I don't know.

03:47.680 --> 03:50.100
Hopefully Dan is going to be back at some point where we'll be able to kind of rotate

03:50.100 --> 03:51.100
in and out.

03:51.100 --> 03:54.840
So learn with us here at Orange Lounge Radio tonight.

03:54.840 --> 03:55.960
Just order a pizza.

03:55.960 --> 03:57.640
Just put the pizza guy on the show.

03:57.640 --> 03:58.640
So talk about games.

03:58.640 --> 04:01.640
And he's like, I'm going to get fired.

04:01.640 --> 04:02.640
Yeah.

04:02.640 --> 04:03.640
You know what?

04:03.640 --> 04:07.600
If it wasn't that Dan couldn't have the sodium, we could totally just do a take and bake.

04:07.600 --> 04:09.560
Send Dan off to be our errand boy.

04:09.560 --> 04:10.560
Good times.

04:10.560 --> 04:11.560
Get a Papa Murphy's.

04:11.560 --> 04:12.560
Good times.

04:12.560 --> 04:16.440
Also joining us, say hello to Bradley, our KDN 42.

04:16.440 --> 04:17.520
You said there'd be surprises.

04:17.520 --> 04:18.520
I'm the first one.

04:18.520 --> 04:19.520
All right.

04:19.520 --> 04:20.520
How are you?

04:20.520 --> 04:23.880
You were on the show a couple months ago, but then like before that, you weren't on

04:23.880 --> 04:24.880
for like a couple years.

04:24.880 --> 04:25.880
I was on a few months ago.

04:25.880 --> 04:26.880
I don't remember.

04:26.880 --> 04:27.880
I thought you were.

04:27.880 --> 04:28.880
Oh, well.

04:28.880 --> 04:32.520
I think the last time I was on was at your house that you were at.

04:32.520 --> 04:33.520
Oh, that was a while ago.

04:33.520 --> 04:34.520
I thought for some reason.

04:34.520 --> 04:35.520
Oh, well.

04:35.520 --> 04:36.520
Whatever.

04:36.520 --> 04:38.520
I think you maybe mentioned me, because I was here for her party or something before

04:38.520 --> 04:39.520
that.

04:39.520 --> 04:40.520
That might have been it.

04:40.520 --> 04:41.520
That might have been it.

04:41.520 --> 04:42.800
And then I popped in the chat room like once or twice.

04:42.800 --> 04:43.800
There you go.

04:43.800 --> 04:44.800
Well, what's new with Bradley?

04:44.800 --> 04:45.800
What are you up to?

04:45.800 --> 04:49.600
Well, I hadn't been playing any games since last week, because I was on the road.

04:49.600 --> 04:52.440
I did like a seven-day trip of national parks.

04:52.440 --> 04:53.440
You do a lot of that.

04:53.440 --> 04:57.080
You do a lot of like, I'm just going to get my car and drive until I run out of gas type

04:57.080 --> 04:58.080
of thing.

04:58.080 --> 04:59.080
Yeah.

04:59.080 --> 05:00.080
Right?

05:00.080 --> 05:01.080
So what are some of the like awesome places you've been to?

05:01.080 --> 05:05.600
I went to Yellowstone, and then I went after that was also Grand Teton, because you have

05:05.600 --> 05:10.180
to go through that if you're in one of the directions.

05:10.180 --> 05:14.800
Then the next one was Theodore Roosevelt, which I just kind of drove around.

05:14.800 --> 05:21.240
And also the next day was Rocky Mountain, where you go up like 12,000 feet when driving.

05:21.240 --> 05:27.840
Then Arches, which have all the natural arches in it, and Canyonlands, which is a big canyon.

05:27.840 --> 05:34.160
Also was, what's the next one after that, was Coral Reef, or Capitol Reef.

05:34.160 --> 05:36.800
Bradley, I'm thinking you should just be a park ranger.

05:36.800 --> 05:39.160
Like can't you see Bradley is a park ranger?

05:39.160 --> 05:40.280
Like I could totally see that.

05:40.280 --> 05:44.280
He'd just be in his cabin during the winters with the Xbox, and what have you.

05:44.280 --> 05:45.280
Good time.

05:45.280 --> 05:49.280
Actually, now, let me give a little background on Orange L'Angereo.

05:49.280 --> 05:52.680
Since we have a lot of extra time today, I can kind of do that for the people who haven't

05:52.680 --> 05:56.640
listened in a very, or who are just now listening, or you haven't heard this story because you

05:56.640 --> 05:58.360
haven't told it in a long time.

05:58.360 --> 06:01.160
Here's what Orange L'Angereo is all about.

06:01.160 --> 06:05.080
We've been broadcasting for about eight years, right?

06:05.080 --> 06:06.080
Over eight years?

06:06.080 --> 06:07.080
I lost count at some point.

06:07.080 --> 06:11.280
It's almost coming up on nine years, but we've been broadcasting about eight years.

06:11.280 --> 06:15.600
Dark Soccer, myself, and Loki all met at a local arcade, and actually Bradley was a part

06:15.600 --> 06:18.440
of this too, all playing Dance Dance Revolution.

06:18.440 --> 06:22.180
We all just got sucked into this game, and it was this whole little like culture and

06:22.180 --> 06:27.560
scene for a time, and there were websites that just got so much traffic when these games

06:27.560 --> 06:30.960
were really at their peak, at least as far as I can tell.

06:30.960 --> 06:34.480
Things like DDR Freak and Spot and so forth.

06:34.480 --> 06:39.760
DDR's still around, but the culture isn't quite the same as it used to be back in my

06:39.760 --> 06:45.200
day, but we decided to start a show about DDR and Dance Dance Revolution and that whole

06:45.200 --> 06:48.300
scene, and that's the way the show was for about the first, what, about three, four years

06:48.300 --> 06:49.300
we were doing that?

06:49.300 --> 06:52.100
Then when podcasting came around, we got into doing that.

06:52.100 --> 06:53.320
We used to do a spinoff show.

06:53.320 --> 06:58.800
It was a spinoff show of our main show about just video games in general, and then that

06:58.800 --> 07:04.320
kind of took off and ended up kind of taking over the DDR part when music games and so

07:04.320 --> 07:12.600
forth were not so popular anymore, so we kind of just built this show around a community,

07:12.600 --> 07:16.500
and that is really what our show is all about at the end of the day, is that after these

07:16.500 --> 07:22.120
long DDR nights at Golfland or wherever we were at, we would go have dinner at a local

07:22.120 --> 07:26.000
restaurant and just talk smack about video games and sometimes each other, so that's

07:26.000 --> 07:28.500
kind of what we tried to bring to the show here.

07:28.500 --> 07:31.200
We like to call ourselves the show where every gamer has a voice.

07:31.200 --> 07:36.320
Since the very beginning, we've always tried to incorporate chat, and this is before podcasting

07:36.320 --> 07:37.520
was really huge.

07:37.520 --> 07:39.600
We tried to incorporate all of this into our show.

07:39.600 --> 07:43.560
I like to think we were one of the first shows that did take calls over Skype, and it's kind

07:43.560 --> 07:47.840
of interesting now that that is the way a lot of podcasts do their whole shows now is

07:47.840 --> 07:51.040
over Skype, so it was kind of neat to be... I don't know if we were the first.

07:51.040 --> 07:54.800
We were definitely one of the first to do that, so that was kind of cool to be on the

07:54.800 --> 07:55.800
cutting edge of that.

07:55.800 --> 07:59.680
So we try to get on the Twitters and the Facebooks and chat and all the ways that you guys can

07:59.680 --> 08:02.200
interact with us, and give us your opinion.

08:02.200 --> 08:05.060
It's because we're technologically able.

08:05.060 --> 08:06.160
We have the technology.

08:06.160 --> 08:08.320
We can repair something.

08:08.320 --> 08:09.320
Something something.

08:09.320 --> 08:10.320
All right.

08:10.320 --> 08:13.160
So anyway, the reason why I give that background is that we all kind of bring different things

08:13.160 --> 08:14.160
to the table.

08:14.160 --> 08:16.800
We all like different types of games.

08:16.800 --> 08:20.300
For instance, Dark Sakura, she does the classic game of the week here on the show every week

08:20.300 --> 08:27.240
because she has a vast brain full of useless video game trivia and these obscure ass import

08:27.240 --> 08:32.880
games, even I don't hear of ever, so that's kind of her background, right?

08:32.880 --> 08:34.840
Is that the kind of fair assessment?

08:34.840 --> 08:35.840
Yeah.

08:35.840 --> 08:36.840
Yeah.

08:36.840 --> 08:39.800
And then Loki... Speaking of random trivia, he has been in

08:39.800 --> 08:45.640
nine different shows or series playing a law enforcement officer.

08:45.640 --> 08:50.280
Granted, the one in Ghostbusters, he was a prison guard, but God damn it, that's close

08:50.280 --> 08:51.280
enough.

08:51.280 --> 08:54.940
So, nine different series or movies or...

08:54.940 --> 08:58.480
Don't you have to be an officer to be a prison guard?

08:58.480 --> 09:01.560
It's still a law enforcement job, so... But yeah, that's a lot.

09:01.560 --> 09:04.360
He's just really typecast, so... Anyways, enough talking about him.

09:04.360 --> 09:05.920
I'm not going to talk about him anymore.

09:05.920 --> 09:06.920
Promise?

09:06.920 --> 09:07.920
Promise.

09:07.920 --> 09:08.920
You're going to have a good 12 hours to do so.

09:08.920 --> 09:10.480
I know you're not staying the whole time, but all right.

09:10.480 --> 09:15.160
Anyway, Loki is kind of... I see him as more of like our tech hack crack.

09:15.160 --> 09:17.980
If there's a way to break the game, he will kind of guy.

09:17.980 --> 09:21.320
He was the guy that probably bought a game genie as soon as they were out to see how

09:21.320 --> 09:22.600
he could screw up the game.

09:22.600 --> 09:24.160
I bought one, though.

09:24.160 --> 09:27.080
Would that be kind of a fair assessment of what you're all about?

09:27.080 --> 09:28.080
Sure.

09:28.080 --> 09:29.080
All right.

09:29.080 --> 09:30.080
And then me, I don't know.

09:30.080 --> 09:33.680
I grew up on Commodore 64 and all the old school games, so I like to think of myself

09:33.680 --> 09:36.920
as kind of like a retro-y gamer as well, but I like a lot of new stuff, too.

09:36.920 --> 09:38.560
I think lately it's been MMOs.

09:38.560 --> 09:41.920
I've played a lot of them, and a lot of computer games, too.

09:41.920 --> 09:46.820
I mean, not all of them, but I try to do them, so I'm just kind of a little bit of everything.

09:46.820 --> 09:51.300
And then the reason why I kind of lay all that out is I want to ask Bradley, what types

09:51.300 --> 09:55.280
of games do you bring... What's your gaming background?

09:55.280 --> 09:58.360
What do you like, what are your likes and dislikes in gaming?

09:58.360 --> 10:01.800
Generally, I play a lot... Most types of games, other than that, maybe sports.

10:01.800 --> 10:02.800
I don't really play sports all that much.

10:02.800 --> 10:05.360
I play them a little bit, but not that much.

10:05.360 --> 10:11.960
I play mostly puzzle games, played RPGs, I used to play those a lot more than I do now

10:11.960 --> 10:15.440
just because I don't have the time to play a long form like that.

10:15.440 --> 10:19.440
Adventure games, and so on.

10:19.440 --> 10:22.760
Cool deal, cool deal.

10:22.760 --> 10:27.960
I always think it's a bad idea when people go around saying, I hate all sports games,

10:27.960 --> 10:29.520
or I hate sports video games.

10:29.520 --> 10:31.320
Sports video games are crap.

10:31.320 --> 10:35.180
A lot of people on this show, it may not be the preference of the types of games we play

10:35.180 --> 10:39.360
most of the time, but I think it would be a lie to say I hate all sports games, because

10:39.360 --> 10:43.160
I love NBA Jam, and I love that it's coming back as an awesome game.

10:43.160 --> 10:46.040
I have a way to make it very nice and simple for you.

10:46.040 --> 10:50.200
It's just like racing games, how you have your arcade racing games, which are fun to

10:50.200 --> 10:55.600
play, and your simulation racing games, which require you to be able to drive and tune a

10:55.600 --> 10:59.820
car with the same precision that you would a real car.

10:59.820 --> 11:02.000
You hate simulation sports games.

11:02.000 --> 11:05.520
You do arcade style sports games, though.

11:05.520 --> 11:09.860
That actually makes a lot of sense, because... And then over there, those folks, usually

11:09.860 --> 11:12.960
it's like, oh, well, I hate all those Japanese RPGs.

11:12.960 --> 11:18.440
There's too much of the same stuff, but maybe I'll play Final Fantasy.

11:18.440 --> 11:23.720
I'll play that one that is kind of out in the mainstream, or music games.

11:23.720 --> 11:26.840
A lot of people are like, that arrow stomping, no, what is that?

11:26.840 --> 11:28.920
That Japanese ravy techno music?

11:28.920 --> 11:29.920
What is that?

11:29.920 --> 11:30.920
What is that?

11:30.920 --> 11:32.480
And I sort of see that as the hardcore music games.

11:32.480 --> 11:38.480
BeatMania 2DX is a hardcore music game, but I'm sure everybody has enjoyed Guitar Hero

11:38.480 --> 11:39.480
at least once.

11:39.480 --> 11:41.720
A rock band, at a party, drunk.

11:41.720 --> 11:43.400
So it's kind of interesting.

11:43.400 --> 11:44.400
This ties into an email.

11:44.400 --> 11:45.960
I don't recommend DDR drunk.

11:45.960 --> 11:47.360
Well, it can be fun.

11:47.360 --> 11:49.160
Until you hit your head.

11:49.160 --> 11:50.160
Responsibly.

11:50.160 --> 11:53.680
We had an email on the show last week that kind of got me thinking about all this, was

11:53.680 --> 11:58.280
the whole, my friend says I'm not a gamer because I don't play X, Y, and Z. Remember

11:58.280 --> 11:59.280
that?

11:59.280 --> 12:04.080
I've been thinking about that email a lot this week, and just like, A, where does your

12:04.080 --> 12:05.640
friend get off telling you that?

12:05.640 --> 12:06.640
Anyway.

12:06.640 --> 12:07.640
All right.

12:07.640 --> 12:09.280
Yeah, well, your friend's a butt.

12:09.280 --> 12:12.200
Let's get into how we always like to start off the show here at Orange Lounge Radio even

12:12.200 --> 12:14.080
though we're, what, like 12 minutes in now.

12:14.080 --> 12:15.580
How was your gaming week?

12:15.580 --> 12:17.760
What kind of video games have you been playing this week, and how were they?

12:17.760 --> 12:19.680
Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week?

12:19.680 --> 12:24.040
It was kind of not, because I've, it's been a busy week for me.

12:24.040 --> 12:32.800
I had school, and I had my visit to the mikvah on Thursday.

12:32.800 --> 12:33.960
My conversion went through.

12:33.960 --> 12:37.760
I am now the official Jew of Orange Lounge Radio.

12:37.760 --> 12:38.760
Congrats!

12:38.760 --> 12:45.680
Although, SSJ100Matt is probably very upset about his title being stripped, and his tiara.

12:45.680 --> 12:47.320
I'm the host.

12:47.320 --> 12:51.200
Okay, you guys can also be, you can be the official co-Jews.

12:51.200 --> 12:55.920
Yes, they can be your, like, it's his yarmulke being stripped.

12:55.920 --> 12:56.920
They can be your harem of Jews.

12:56.920 --> 12:57.920
I don't know what you would call that.

12:57.920 --> 12:58.920
They can be my posse.

12:58.920 --> 13:01.360
All right, your posse.

13:01.360 --> 13:04.480
And anyway, my chavahra.

13:04.480 --> 13:05.480
That's it.

13:05.480 --> 13:09.120
Anyway, so yeah, that happened, and it was really great, and then I had to go talk in

13:09.120 --> 13:10.760
front of people on Friday.

13:10.760 --> 13:19.080
But I played some Star Trek Online, and I had to go because Dan came home, and it was,

13:19.080 --> 13:22.840
I don't know, I played a little bit, not a lot, just some.

13:22.840 --> 13:31.640
And oh, oh, oh, oh, my anniversary was on Wednesday, my fifth anniversary, so Dan got

13:31.640 --> 13:35.120
me this instead of a rose, so it was three ambitions.

13:35.120 --> 13:36.520
And isn't that much better than a rose?

13:36.520 --> 13:43.240
Yeah, he also wrote me a note that said, in fact, here it is, I'll put it up on the thing,

13:43.240 --> 13:44.240
it's on my Facebook right now.

13:44.240 --> 13:49.000
Sorry I didn't get you a rose, I thought you would like this more, I love you, D.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
Aww.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.600
I'll take a picture and put it on the thing.

13:51.600 --> 13:52.600
That's sweet.

13:52.600 --> 13:53.600
Yeah.

13:53.600 --> 13:55.600
You should gush about him while he's not here to defend himself, it's really cute.

13:55.600 --> 13:58.560
Because, you know, he has to be a manly man when he's here on the show, but.

13:58.560 --> 14:02.440
I wish Dan would stop leaving his underwear in the hall.

14:02.440 --> 14:09.680
Okay, let's move on to Loki, how was your gaming week?

14:09.680 --> 14:19.680
My gaming week was pretty slim, I played more Grand Theft Auto, Lost and Damned, still fun.

14:19.680 --> 14:26.720
And I played a few other things that I probably shouldn't be talking about, but I don't care,

14:26.720 --> 14:28.840
because I'm not under any sort of NDA.

14:28.840 --> 14:35.640
So I got my dev kit this week for the Xbox, you know, my Xbox 360 dev kit, and to be honest

14:35.640 --> 14:43.720
it's not as exciting as I would have thought it would have been, because the network that

14:43.720 --> 14:50.560
should not be named, that has partner in it, really only has Xbox Live Arcade games and

14:50.560 --> 14:55.760
download content that they're testing, so there's a few games on there that haven't

14:55.760 --> 14:59.740
really been leaked out for JTAG users and that kind of stuff, so I got to play a few

14:59.740 --> 15:05.520
different Xbox Live Arcade games that aren't out yet, that are actually kind of cool.

15:05.520 --> 15:14.640
So one of them that I played was Bonk, apparently they're remaking Bonk, from Bonk's Adventure,

15:14.640 --> 15:22.120
the old TurboGrafx game, and it's okay, it's kind of done along the lines of how they did

15:22.120 --> 15:28.080
the Hudson Adventure Island remake.

15:28.080 --> 15:33.000
It's okay, but the one thing that they kind of took out of it that really made Bonk, Bonk,

15:33.000 --> 15:35.640
is his giant head.

15:35.640 --> 15:41.080
His head is now a little bit more proportioned to his body, which really sucks, because it

15:41.080 --> 15:45.480
has the same type, like when you're climbing a wall before in Bonk's Adventure, he used

15:45.480 --> 15:46.480
to use his teeth.

15:46.480 --> 15:50.840
Well, in this, he's still biting the wall, but he also looks like he's climbing, so it

15:50.840 --> 15:53.080
doesn't make any sense why he's biting the wall.

15:53.080 --> 15:56.920
I don't remember a new Adventure Island game, was that on the Wii or something?

15:56.920 --> 15:57.920
It was on the Wii.

15:57.920 --> 15:58.920
Huh.

15:58.920 --> 16:01.080
It was, I think it was a WiiWare game.

16:01.080 --> 16:02.080
Nice.

16:02.080 --> 16:03.080
But it wasn't very good.

16:03.080 --> 16:04.080
Oh, okay.

16:04.080 --> 16:05.080
That's too bad.

16:05.080 --> 16:11.360
And this one's kind of just okay, but I don't know, it looks like it might be pretty fun,

16:11.360 --> 16:15.480
I didn't play a whole lot of it, just a few levels, but it's alright.

16:15.480 --> 16:18.920
It's just, I really wish they'd left his head in, you know, really big, oh, they don't really

16:18.920 --> 16:24.800
have to change too much, just use like, just clean up the sprites a little bit, and go

16:24.800 --> 16:26.600
from there, I mean.

16:26.600 --> 16:30.680
The last Adventure Island game I remember playing that I just absolutely loved was Super

16:30.680 --> 16:34.560
Adventure Island on the Super Nintendo, I don't know if you guys ever played this game,

16:34.560 --> 16:38.520
but I think one of the reasons I really loved that game was the soundtrack to that game

16:38.520 --> 16:40.080
was amazing.

16:40.080 --> 16:44.560
And it turns out Yuzo Koshiro was the guy that did the soundtrack for that, and if you

16:44.560 --> 16:47.840
don't know him, he's done a lot of awesome game music.

16:47.840 --> 16:51.280
He does like the Wangan, Midnight, Maximum Tune, a lot of those soundtracks.

16:51.280 --> 16:56.880
I believe he did Actraiser, like yeah, he did the original Actraiser, Streets of Rage

16:56.880 --> 17:02.120
2, Shinobi, I mean he's done so many like awesome soundtracks, so he's just, he's like

17:02.120 --> 17:06.640
one of my favorite gaming musician guys.

17:06.640 --> 17:12.340
Other things that I tried playing, Super Meat Boy was up there, but the version that they

17:12.340 --> 17:18.440
have on Partner Net is broken, it doesn't go past the main menu because you can move

17:18.440 --> 17:21.800
the cursor around on the menu, but no button that you press will actually allow you to

17:21.800 --> 17:25.520
start the game, which kinda sucked, because I wanted to play that.

17:25.520 --> 17:33.240
And then, what else did I play, there was one other game I played, it was a dancing

17:33.240 --> 17:38.560
game that's coming out actually, yeah, Dance It's Your Stage, which we'll be talking about

17:38.560 --> 17:43.680
coming out next week.

17:43.680 --> 17:50.240
It's terrible, it's really, really bad, and I don't know, I'm not too familiar with the

17:50.240 --> 17:55.080
game itself, but I think based off the music that I saw on there, and that guy looks like

17:55.080 --> 18:03.480
a total douche, I believe it's, it says it's a port of a German Wii game, I think it's

18:03.480 --> 18:09.320
based off of, yeah, it's based off of a TV show.

18:09.320 --> 18:13.320
That's so strange that they're bringing it here then, does it have David Hasselhoff in

18:13.320 --> 18:15.360
it then that you can dance to?

18:15.360 --> 18:20.640
No, but the music though in it is just not good.

18:20.640 --> 18:22.480
That's really the only thing that kinda sucks.

18:22.480 --> 18:29.920
The gameplay itself isn't very good either because it's got two kind of, two areas where

18:29.920 --> 18:36.720
I guess steps or directions will go down, but it's not like DDR or something where one

18:36.720 --> 18:39.420
column's up, one column's down, etc.

18:39.420 --> 18:43.640
It's mixed all over the place, and so you may have up in like the left column, then

18:43.640 --> 18:50.760
up in the right column, and it gets really confusing when it's going really fast, and

18:50.760 --> 18:58.560
then also the music's very, very, very, very terrible, so I really don't recommend picking

18:58.560 --> 19:03.600
it up, not that many people probably would have next week anyways, but it is a terrible

19:03.600 --> 19:04.600
game.

19:04.600 --> 19:07.940
Very, very, very terrible game.

19:07.940 --> 19:09.120
Is it bad?

19:09.120 --> 19:10.120
It's very bad.

19:10.120 --> 19:11.120
I wasn't sure.

19:11.120 --> 19:12.120
It's terra-bad.

19:12.120 --> 19:13.120
It's terra-bad.

19:13.120 --> 19:14.120
Terra-bad.

19:14.120 --> 19:17.120
What else did I play?

19:17.120 --> 19:24.680
Oh yeah, one other, I played a cave shooter game, and I'm gonna butcher the name, I believe

19:24.680 --> 19:29.960
it was called like Guranji or something like that, I don't know, it's just from memory

19:29.960 --> 19:30.960
there.

19:30.960 --> 19:37.360
Anyways, it's your typical cave shooter games, really, I guess, I don't really know the premise

19:37.360 --> 19:44.040
of it because it was all in Japanese, but you can control kind of like a god deity thing

19:44.040 --> 19:49.120
that's helping you out, and I don't know, it's just like all the other cave shmup games,

19:49.120 --> 19:53.440
but that'll become the Xbox Live Arcade in Japan very soon I believe.

19:53.440 --> 19:55.200
Not sure about over here.

19:55.200 --> 19:56.200
Hopefully over here though.

19:56.200 --> 19:57.200
Awesome.

19:57.200 --> 19:58.200
That's fun.

19:58.200 --> 19:59.200
Alright, that it?

19:59.200 --> 20:00.200
Piggy mooing?

20:00.200 --> 20:01.200
That is it.

20:01.200 --> 20:05.840
I'm gonna be looking forward to your sneak peeks every week now of new stuff coming out

20:05.840 --> 20:06.840
until you get shut down.

20:06.840 --> 20:11.720
Yeah, until the console gets banned off, banned off PartnerNet.

20:11.720 --> 20:17.200
Not that, usually when they would ban the consoles it's not, it's actually worse than

20:17.200 --> 20:22.520
like if you got banned off live because when they ban your console they blow all the e-fuses

20:22.520 --> 20:25.640
and it makes your console very broken.

20:25.640 --> 20:26.640
Wow.

20:26.640 --> 20:27.640
But.

20:27.640 --> 20:28.640
That's kind of evil.

20:28.640 --> 20:33.680
But the person that sold me the console took out the resistor that allows, you know, those

20:33.680 --> 20:40.280
e-fuses to be blown, so if they ban me from PartnerNet, the console will be just fine.

20:40.280 --> 20:43.920
That's kind of, that's like Mission Impossible where it's like this message will self-destruct

20:43.920 --> 20:44.920
in 30 seconds.

20:44.920 --> 20:48.680
Yeah, but here's the thing, you know, it's, if I got banned from PartnerNet I probably

20:48.680 --> 20:53.680
wouldn't care because here I thought there was gonna be like, you know, actual beta tests

20:53.680 --> 20:55.220
of games and stuff like that.

20:55.220 --> 20:56.220
That's not the case.

20:56.220 --> 21:01.100
And I could definitely see why they don't do that because people would be leaking that

21:01.100 --> 21:05.680
crap left and right and even still with some of the arcade games people leak them out there

21:05.680 --> 21:09.960
and you know, that's got to suck for them, but I don't know.

21:09.960 --> 21:10.960
There's some neat stuff on there.

21:10.960 --> 21:15.820
The whole fall lineup of stuff that we'll probably be covering later on is up there.

21:15.820 --> 21:16.820
So some of it's pretty cool.

21:16.820 --> 21:18.400
I played a little bit of Comic Jumper.

21:18.400 --> 21:24.560
That was kind of neat, but really, really briefly checked it out, so.

21:24.560 --> 21:25.560
All right.

21:25.560 --> 21:29.800
Let's go to our chat room at chat.orangetonstrady.com, the always present fourth guest on the show,

21:29.800 --> 21:33.080
although we really have like five people in the studio tonight, but who's counting?

21:33.080 --> 21:36.320
Chat.orangetonstrady.com is where you can share your comments and we'll read them here

21:36.320 --> 21:37.320
on air.

21:37.320 --> 21:41.440
We'll start off tonight the marathon with a comment from Spazinator who is talking about

21:41.440 --> 21:44.840
the soundtracks because I was talking about Yuzuru Koshiro a little bit ago, says, in

21:44.840 --> 21:51.480
my opinion, the OSTs for Killer Instinct, Actraiser, Super Castlevania IV, and Mr. Bones

21:51.480 --> 21:53.040
have the best music.

21:53.040 --> 21:55.680
Those are all some really good soundtracks, although I don't know Mr. Bones.

21:55.680 --> 21:56.680
What system was that on?

21:56.680 --> 21:57.800
Is that PSN or something?

21:57.800 --> 22:06.600
I think it was a PS3 and or a PSP game, but I know it came out on one of the Sony systems.

22:06.600 --> 22:08.040
It was the skeleton guy.

22:08.040 --> 22:09.040
Oh, okay.

22:09.040 --> 22:10.040
You remember?

22:10.040 --> 22:11.040
Well, hence the name Mr. Bones.

22:11.040 --> 22:12.040
Yeah.

22:12.040 --> 22:13.040
I think I might have it somewhere.

22:13.040 --> 22:14.040
Okay.

22:14.040 --> 22:19.880
The Killer Cuts CD that you got when you pre-ordered Killer Instinct on SNES was amazing.

22:19.880 --> 22:20.880
Yes it was.

22:20.880 --> 22:22.440
Hours and hours played in high school.

22:22.440 --> 22:24.240
It wasn't necessarily a pre-order either.

22:24.240 --> 22:28.000
I just went into Montgomery Wards back in the day and bought mine and I said, where's

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
my CD?

22:30.000 --> 22:31.880
Nice.

22:31.880 --> 22:37.880
I would say one of my favorites was not actually from the game at all, but was the soundtrack

22:37.880 --> 22:41.880
to the Mortal Kombat motion picture because that CD was awesome.

22:41.880 --> 22:43.280
Mortal Kombat.

22:43.280 --> 22:44.280
Test your mind.

22:44.280 --> 22:46.360
I have that song somewhere off the plate on break.

22:46.360 --> 22:47.360
All right.

22:47.360 --> 22:48.960
Anyway, let's move on to my gaming week.

22:48.960 --> 22:49.960
I'll talk quickly about this.

22:49.960 --> 22:52.120
Now, was that the Mortal Kombat game soundtrack?

22:52.120 --> 22:54.440
No, the actual movie soundtrack was awesome.

22:54.440 --> 22:57.480
Yeah, the Mortal movie soundtrack was awesome, but remember the one that they did for the

22:57.480 --> 22:58.480
game?

22:58.480 --> 22:59.480
Less awesome.

22:59.480 --> 23:00.480
Oh, come on.

23:00.480 --> 23:01.480
That was very awesome.

23:01.480 --> 23:02.480
It was so awesome.

23:02.480 --> 23:05.000
We used to play Keys or That soundtrack.

23:05.000 --> 23:08.920
And Spaznator is clarifying in chat that Mr. Bones was a Sega Saturn game.

23:08.920 --> 23:09.920
That was it.

23:09.920 --> 23:15.920
Are you thinking about the Ghosts and Goblins kind of game that was on...

23:15.920 --> 23:16.920
Nevermind.

23:16.920 --> 23:19.280
Let's see.

23:19.280 --> 23:21.040
We got a lot of other comments in chats here.

23:21.040 --> 23:22.040
Oh.

23:22.040 --> 23:23.040
What?

23:23.040 --> 23:24.040
Sorry.

23:24.040 --> 23:25.040
I was going to add one more thing to my gaming week.

23:25.040 --> 23:26.040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

23:26.040 --> 23:29.560
It's not really my gaming week yet, but it will be.

23:29.560 --> 23:36.520
Unless you haven't read my Twitter, I will be getting an iPod touch.

23:36.520 --> 23:41.800
Now, I know what you're thinking, this goes against my total hatred of Macs.

23:41.800 --> 23:42.800
Wrong.

23:42.800 --> 23:44.160
And really Apple in general.

23:44.160 --> 23:50.720
Well, I kind of gotten blinded by the whole hating Macs because iPods are not Macs.

23:50.720 --> 23:53.440
iPods are their own thing.

23:53.440 --> 23:54.440
They're actually...

23:54.440 --> 23:57.720
Sure, rationalize it however you can, Loki.

23:57.720 --> 23:59.640
It's the backpedal express.

23:59.640 --> 24:01.640
Choo choo.

24:01.640 --> 24:04.720
To be fair, I didn't pay for this with my own money, so...

24:04.720 --> 24:06.080
I think that's what it really is.

24:06.080 --> 24:09.640
If he's being given them, how can he say no?

24:09.640 --> 24:12.280
I mean, they are still great MP3 players and stuff.

24:12.280 --> 24:14.200
No, I think they're decent MP3s.

24:14.200 --> 24:17.280
Well, I don't really give a crap about playing MP3s, but...

24:17.280 --> 24:19.800
Other game systems now, too, really.

24:19.800 --> 24:20.800
Yeah.

24:20.800 --> 24:26.960
But, you know, if they gave me the gift card and said you have to spend it on a Mac computer,

24:26.960 --> 24:29.440
I think I'd have issues, but...

24:29.440 --> 24:30.440
I'm fine with the new iPod.

24:30.440 --> 24:33.000
But you're not going to be pre-ordering the Apple TV anytime soon.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
Oh, fuck no.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
I don't care.

24:35.000 --> 24:37.920
Because there was a big Apple thing this week, and it actually involved gaming.

24:37.920 --> 24:41.480
We'll get into that a little later, and we'll get more of Loki's thoughts at that point.

24:41.480 --> 24:44.560
I want to read some more comments from chat, because chat is talking about other gaming

24:44.560 --> 24:45.560
soundtracks.

24:45.560 --> 24:51.440
Haseo Sumiragawa, I hope I said that right, says Final Fantasy X soundtrack for the win.

24:51.440 --> 24:54.760
And let's see, Redertainment says the music from Brutal Legend was awesome.

24:54.760 --> 24:58.420
Too bad they never released a formal original soundtrack for that game.

24:58.420 --> 25:04.120
And then Cyberbeast, I love this, chimes in with, Daytona.

25:04.120 --> 25:07.600
You know what game actually had, well, one of the little side soundtracks that they did

25:07.600 --> 25:10.200
was Final Fantasy Prey and Celtic Moon.

25:10.200 --> 25:11.200
Oh yeah.

25:11.200 --> 25:14.640
Those were both gorgeous arrangements of the music.

25:14.640 --> 25:16.720
Was Prey the one that was all piano?

25:16.720 --> 25:17.960
Because there's one where all the songs were piano.

25:17.960 --> 25:19.240
It was the lady singing.

25:19.240 --> 25:20.240
Okay.

25:20.240 --> 25:21.240
Well, there's a third.

25:21.240 --> 25:26.280
It had a lot that was on piano, but Celtic Moon was all the, you know, Celtic style.

25:26.280 --> 25:27.280
Right, right.

25:27.280 --> 25:28.280
Good stuff.

25:28.280 --> 25:29.280
Yeah.

25:29.280 --> 25:30.280
All right.

25:30.280 --> 25:31.280
All right.

25:31.280 --> 25:32.280
We'll be keeping an eye on chat throughout the night.

25:32.280 --> 25:34.280
Chat at orangesongsradio.com.

25:34.280 --> 25:37.080
Amaysatsuma says, Loki, your soul is mine.

25:37.080 --> 25:38.080
Love, Steve Jobs.

25:38.080 --> 25:39.080
There you go.

25:39.080 --> 25:41.320
I haven't spent the gift card on something.

25:41.320 --> 25:44.400
It was either that or, like, a bunch of the nanos.

25:44.400 --> 25:48.720
And what the hell would I do with a bunch of nanos or a bunch of the shuffles or whatever?

25:48.720 --> 25:53.560
Well, I was telling Loki that here in California, there's actually a state law.

25:53.560 --> 25:54.940
A lot of people don't know this.

25:54.940 --> 26:00.480
But if you get a gift card, like, let's say somebody gives you a target card, or no, I

26:00.480 --> 26:01.480
got one that's a lot more practical.

26:01.480 --> 26:05.560
Somebody gives you a Walmart card for Christmas, and it's like, you know, 50 bucks or what

26:05.560 --> 26:06.560
have you.

26:06.560 --> 26:08.360
And you're like, ew, I don't like Walmart.

26:08.360 --> 26:09.880
I'm not going to shop at Walmart ever.

26:09.880 --> 26:13.240
You can actually take that gift card in and get the cash value of the card back.

26:13.240 --> 26:14.480
There's actually a law in the books here.

26:14.480 --> 26:17.320
I don't know what other states have that, but it's here.

26:17.320 --> 26:22.040
But what a lot of companies do sometimes is that if they're buying these cards in bulk,

26:22.040 --> 26:23.600
then there's a discount on them.

26:23.600 --> 26:29.520
Like, you know, if a company buys $55 Starbucks cards to give away as an incentive, they might

26:29.520 --> 26:31.240
reduce the cost of that.

26:31.240 --> 26:32.920
So that way they have no cash value.

26:32.920 --> 26:34.040
They're not really gift cards.

26:34.040 --> 26:35.660
They're like coupons.

26:35.660 --> 26:37.680
And so then you can't do that.

26:37.680 --> 26:40.960
So it really depends if someone paid full cash value up front or not.

26:40.960 --> 26:41.960
Yeah.

26:41.960 --> 26:42.960
So.

26:42.960 --> 26:43.960
All right.

26:43.960 --> 26:44.960
And Zebo wants to know how you got the gift card.

26:44.960 --> 26:45.960
What did you do?

26:45.960 --> 26:46.960
Was it a present?

26:46.960 --> 26:47.960
I don't know if you can talk about it.

26:47.960 --> 26:48.960
No, I can talk about it.

26:48.960 --> 26:50.760
It's not really anything I did.

26:50.760 --> 26:52.160
It's actually what our video reps did.

26:52.160 --> 26:59.840
Our video reps, they do sales incentives with Sony for various titles throughout the year.

26:59.840 --> 27:03.840
And we've gotten a bunch of things actually from Sony and thankfully they do include us

27:03.840 --> 27:09.200
game reps, even though we have nothing to do with this in on the little spiff.

27:09.200 --> 27:14.960
So like, for example, we've gotten a Sony HDTV.

27:14.960 --> 27:20.760
We've gotten a surround sound system, a camcorder, and they got a PlayStation 3.

27:20.760 --> 27:25.080
I wasn't included on that, but don't care, I already have one.

27:25.080 --> 27:30.920
And then we're going to be getting probably later on this year a Sony style card for $500.

27:30.920 --> 27:34.480
So they actually gave us a $500 card for Apple.

27:34.480 --> 27:39.920
Apparently they just said, eh, screw it, we don't care about the PSP, you know.

27:39.920 --> 27:40.920
We give up.

27:40.920 --> 27:41.920
Buy Apple.

27:41.920 --> 27:42.920
You know?

27:42.920 --> 27:43.920
So I think they're just trying to mix it up.

27:43.920 --> 27:47.840
Tiara suggested that you could buy a bunch of shuffles and throw them like ninja stars.

27:47.840 --> 27:54.920
No, I decided, because I'm nice and a wonderful husband and stuff, I bought myself an iPod.

27:54.920 --> 27:59.600
The new iPod touch, eight gig, one for myself and one for my wife.

27:59.600 --> 28:01.360
To which she's like, what am I going to do with that?

28:01.360 --> 28:03.560
I'm like, God, I should have just spent it.

28:03.560 --> 28:04.840
Put Bejeweled on it for her.

28:04.840 --> 28:06.600
I was going, she doesn't care.

28:06.600 --> 28:08.800
She's like, I can play Bejeweled online.

28:08.800 --> 28:12.320
And she, you know, I'm like, well, you can browse the internet with that.

28:12.320 --> 28:14.920
Well, can I just browse the internet anywhere or do I have to be on wifi?

28:14.920 --> 28:16.360
Well, you have to be on wifi.

28:16.360 --> 28:17.360
Well, that's stupid.

28:17.360 --> 28:19.200
I'll just use my computer here.

28:19.200 --> 28:20.200
Does Apple make diapers?

28:20.200 --> 28:22.920
Because we could use those right now.

28:22.920 --> 28:27.400
You should, you should sell it and get the money so we can put it in our savings account.

28:27.400 --> 28:29.240
That's always the answer for stuff.

28:29.240 --> 28:33.760
So you know, the next time, like when we get that Sony style card, she isn't getting shit.

28:33.760 --> 28:34.760
That's all mine.

28:34.760 --> 28:38.880
Then again, though, I don't know what the hell I'd get from Sony style for $500 because

28:38.880 --> 28:41.720
Nelly sounds like my mother.

28:41.720 --> 28:44.240
It's just her Jewiness, I guess.

28:44.240 --> 28:46.000
Oh, wait, wait.

28:46.000 --> 28:49.360
Dark soccer can officially be offended by that now.

28:49.360 --> 28:50.760
I'm not offended.

28:50.760 --> 28:55.160
She will just, she will just become more frugal.

28:55.160 --> 28:56.160
That's yeah.

28:56.160 --> 28:57.160
Yes.

28:57.160 --> 28:58.160
I'm well aware.

28:58.160 --> 28:59.160
Robot unicorn attack is on the app store.

28:59.160 --> 29:01.160
I was just going to read that comment for Jay Dizzle and Jeff.

29:01.160 --> 29:02.920
I will probably be downloading it.

29:02.920 --> 29:03.920
Actually.

29:03.920 --> 29:04.920
I want to download Mirror's Edge because that looks pretty awesome.

29:04.920 --> 29:05.920
I have it on my phone.

29:05.920 --> 29:06.920
If you want to look at it.

29:06.920 --> 29:07.920
No.

29:07.920 --> 29:08.920
The robot unicorn attack.

29:08.920 --> 29:09.920
All right.

29:09.920 --> 29:10.920
Anyway.

29:10.920 --> 29:11.920
Look, he's like, I don't care.

29:11.920 --> 29:12.920
I don't care.

29:12.920 --> 29:13.920
All right.

29:13.920 --> 29:14.920
Let me talk about my gaming week.

29:14.920 --> 29:15.920
Um, my gaming week.

29:15.920 --> 29:16.920
I actually didn't play a whole lot of new stuff.

29:16.920 --> 29:17.920
Most of the same old, same old.

29:17.920 --> 29:19.160
I will talk about one new thing I played.

29:19.160 --> 29:21.160
I got to, uh, get a sneak peek at something.

29:21.160 --> 29:22.160
Just like, look, he did.

29:22.160 --> 29:27.120
I got to play World of Warcraft Cataclysm, the beta for that, uh, at least for a little

29:27.120 --> 29:28.120
bit.

29:28.120 --> 29:31.240
It worked for like a morning and then I couldn't get in all day yesterday.

29:31.240 --> 29:33.640
So, um, Alan watched me play this too.

29:33.640 --> 29:34.640
It was cool.

29:34.640 --> 29:39.640
I rolled a Worgen and leveled it through about the first six levels and Worgen are very,

29:39.640 --> 29:41.320
they seem really cool to me.

29:41.320 --> 29:46.120
Like I, I think that the Blizzard went all out making their new, uh, race is pretty cool

29:46.120 --> 29:49.120
because the Worgen, you know, they're all kind of like British people.

29:49.120 --> 29:52.880
They all, they all talk like British people and you know, have the accents and everything.

29:52.880 --> 29:56.920
And then it's just awesome because like right when you start it, like werewolves are attacking

29:56.920 --> 30:00.840
and they're all over and it actually feels like a really bad like horror movie or something.

30:00.840 --> 30:01.840
I don't know.

30:01.840 --> 30:02.840
It was cool.

30:02.840 --> 30:03.840
But yeah, go ahead.

30:03.840 --> 30:09.800
I'll say, well, Gilneas is very Victorian, very 1800s and when, uh, Rob found a female

30:09.800 --> 30:13.720
MPC and clicked on her, she said something and he's like, oh, they sound like the Spice

30:13.720 --> 30:14.720
Girls.

30:14.720 --> 30:15.720
Yes, they do.

30:15.720 --> 30:20.160
So, uh, you know, I was, I was having fun with that and I leveled through about six

30:20.160 --> 30:24.460
levels and I actually got to the part where you get, you actually turn into a werewolf,

30:24.460 --> 30:27.940
but it's so great because in the beta right now it actually says there will be a movie

30:27.940 --> 30:33.440
here where you transform into a Worgen and then it just warps you to the post movie place,

30:33.440 --> 30:34.720
which I thought was really cool.

30:34.720 --> 30:36.040
But there's just some awesome quests.

30:36.040 --> 30:37.640
Like they're really starting to ramp up some of the quests.

30:37.640 --> 30:40.760
Like let me tell you what my favorite quest I did was one where you have to go around

30:40.760 --> 30:44.980
and you collect barrels and when you collect the barrels and you have to walk up to the

30:44.980 --> 30:51.560
giant fat abomination creatures and you put the barrel on its head and then your character

30:51.560 --> 30:56.920
will yell fire and then the camera zooms back in a seamless motion and it goes back up to

30:56.920 --> 31:01.160
where you started the quest and there's a guy there with a gun and it shows him aiming

31:01.160 --> 31:05.600
it at the barrel and pulling the trigger and you watch the bullet fly with the camera and

31:05.600 --> 31:11.080
it hits the bullet and the abomination is saying something like, oh, me worried.

31:11.080 --> 31:15.480
And then the bullet hits the barrel, which is filled with gunpowder and the dude explodes

31:15.480 --> 31:16.640
and chunks go everywhere.

31:16.640 --> 31:17.640
It's awesome.

31:17.640 --> 31:18.920
And I was like, it sounds like fun.

31:18.920 --> 31:19.920
It's getting hardcore.

31:19.920 --> 31:20.960
I'm liking this stuff.

31:20.960 --> 31:24.720
So and apparently I didn't play the goblin area yet, but apparently they have like a

31:24.720 --> 31:29.760
highway through the goblin town and there's like all these like car racing, Mario Kart

31:29.760 --> 31:30.980
type quests.

31:30.980 --> 31:34.080
So they're getting crazy with all the different quests they have in the games.

31:34.080 --> 31:40.600
I've heard it called Grand Theft Azshara because of all the little cars.

31:40.600 --> 31:41.600
That's awesome.

31:41.600 --> 31:45.600
So yeah, I know the, the crack is, is, is saying your name, dark Sakura.

31:45.600 --> 31:49.440
I actually, I was just thinking that something that would be fun is if I play Sims all throughout

31:49.440 --> 31:53.760
the show and have a house built by the end of the show, if you want, if you want to go

31:53.760 --> 31:56.480
or started at five or I'll log into Star Trek online.

31:56.480 --> 31:57.480
All right.

31:57.480 --> 31:58.480
No, no, no, no, no.

31:58.480 --> 31:59.480
I wouldn't do that.

31:59.480 --> 32:00.480
I don't know.

32:00.480 --> 32:02.560
Honestly guys, I don't know what we're going to do once the regular show is over.

32:02.560 --> 32:05.040
We're going to fill seven hours of radio somehow.

32:05.040 --> 32:06.040
We'll figure it out.

32:06.040 --> 32:07.040
We get there.

32:07.040 --> 32:08.840
Uh, but that was really the only new thing I played this week was, was the cataclysm

32:08.840 --> 32:09.840
beta.

32:09.840 --> 32:10.840
That was one of the new 80 stuff.

32:10.840 --> 32:14.760
Cause like I said, I played it once and I was waiting for my character to copy over

32:14.760 --> 32:15.760
and it wasn't there yet.

32:15.760 --> 32:17.160
And then I wasn't able to get back in.

32:17.160 --> 32:19.440
I don't know if there's a problem with my account or what's going on.

32:19.440 --> 32:22.040
So I'll just have to figure it out later.

32:22.040 --> 32:27.200
So, uh, but yeah, Worgen thumbs up for me, that was a fun little opening quest.

32:27.200 --> 32:30.480
I always like it and to see some of this new stuff, but I gotta be careful how much of

32:30.480 --> 32:34.200
it I play because I don't want to ruin the actual release.

32:34.200 --> 32:37.040
But luckily a lot of it is still really janky.

32:37.040 --> 32:41.920
Like there's missing textures in some places and you know, a lot of like odd things, you

32:41.920 --> 32:44.080
know, so the, the full release will still be good.

32:44.080 --> 32:51.080
Speaking of janky, um, did, uh, the final fantasy 11 or not 11, might as well be 11

32:51.080 --> 32:52.080
cause it sucks.

32:52.080 --> 32:56.080
Uh, no, the final fantasy 14 beta, the open beta start this week.

32:56.080 --> 32:57.080
I don't remember.

32:57.080 --> 32:59.580
Sort of, but a lot of people are having problems getting in.

32:59.580 --> 33:03.240
I guess you have to actually register for the open beta and they're only letting so

33:03.240 --> 33:04.720
many people in at a time.

33:04.720 --> 33:05.720
That's not closed beta.

33:05.720 --> 33:06.720
That's stupid.

33:06.720 --> 33:07.720
I'm hearing they're having a lot of problems.

33:07.720 --> 33:14.000
It's either limiting the amount of people that can play the beta, just like the time.

33:14.000 --> 33:19.360
I got an email inviting me to the open beta and I saw like the next morning or whatever

33:19.360 --> 33:21.840
and I didn't bother signing up for it cause I don't care.

33:21.840 --> 33:26.160
But on my Facebook, a lot of people, I guess they've got the same email and we're saying

33:26.160 --> 33:30.440
that once you click through on the email, it was only open for like an hour of signups

33:30.440 --> 33:32.440
and then they reclosed it.

33:32.440 --> 33:33.440
So it's.

33:33.440 --> 33:34.440
Yeah.

33:34.440 --> 33:35.440
Yeah.

33:35.440 --> 33:36.440
That games, that games in a lot of trouble.

33:36.440 --> 33:41.440
Uh, I'm, I'm worried they, they, they really, if they're smart, they're going to push back

33:41.440 --> 33:43.600
the release of that game and not try to release it.

33:43.600 --> 33:44.920
But it might be too late now.

33:44.920 --> 33:45.920
I don't know.

33:45.920 --> 33:50.720
Uh, but also speaking of release dates, playing this world of Warcraft beta got me thinking.

33:50.720 --> 33:52.660
I don't think it's coming out this year.

33:52.660 --> 33:55.720
Like I know Blizzard has swore up and down that they're going to try and get it out this

33:55.720 --> 33:56.720
year.

33:56.720 --> 34:01.060
Uh, if they make this year, mid December is like the earliest you're going to see this

34:01.060 --> 34:02.060
game.

34:02.060 --> 34:03.260
It'll be out before Christmas.

34:03.260 --> 34:04.260
It's going to be mid December.

34:04.260 --> 34:07.800
Then it had like you when you say before Christmas, you mean like two weeks before before Christmas

34:07.800 --> 34:13.160
because they've already sent out a map notice, um, saying that their map, um, stuff's ending

34:13.160 --> 34:14.160
on the 25th.

34:14.160 --> 34:15.160
Really?

34:15.160 --> 34:21.640
I feel like there's a lot left still of, um, I mean, that can change it doesn't really

34:21.640 --> 34:25.760
matter that they sent out that notice, but I'm just saying that right now that's what

34:25.760 --> 34:28.280
they're saying is that it's going to be out before Christmas.

34:28.280 --> 34:31.920
Well, they're probably waiting to announce the actual release date at Blizzcon, but I'm,

34:31.920 --> 34:35.080
I'm thinking mid December because there's still all this stuff they got to do.

34:35.080 --> 34:39.460
They've got to do the actual patch for Cataclysm, which will probably be about three weeks before

34:39.460 --> 34:40.920
the game releases.

34:40.920 --> 34:44.360
They've got to do the world event that leads up to the Cataclysm, which is a good, you

34:44.360 --> 34:45.960
know, another three weeks.

34:45.960 --> 34:50.160
They've got to do one more patch still of the taking of Nomur, Nomurgan and, uh, Echo

34:50.160 --> 34:51.160
Islands.

34:51.160 --> 34:52.460
You know, that still has to happen too.

34:52.460 --> 34:57.640
So there's still a good 10 weeks of plot content that has to happen before the game can come

34:57.640 --> 34:58.640
out.

34:58.640 --> 35:01.040
So there's only so much time left, so we'll see.

35:01.040 --> 35:02.040
All right.

35:02.040 --> 35:04.800
Um, let's move on to our guests and their gaming weeks.

35:04.800 --> 35:07.760
Uh, Alan, how was your gaming week?

35:07.760 --> 35:09.520
Um, pretty boring.

35:09.520 --> 35:12.560
Same old, same old, uh, maybe an hour or two of Zuma's Revenge.

35:12.560 --> 35:13.560
Revisited that.

35:13.560 --> 35:14.560
A lot of fun.

35:14.560 --> 35:16.040
And then just a lot of wow.

35:16.040 --> 35:17.040
No real developments there.

35:17.040 --> 35:19.240
What's your big wow accomplishments lately?

35:19.240 --> 35:25.040
Um, I got enough rep with the Oracles to buy their stupid egg that hatches once a week

35:25.040 --> 35:27.480
to try and get the mount from it.

35:27.480 --> 35:28.480
That's about it.

35:28.480 --> 35:29.480
Good times.

35:29.480 --> 35:30.480
Very boring.

35:30.480 --> 35:31.480
Good times.

35:31.480 --> 35:32.480
All right.

35:32.480 --> 35:36.000
Any other games that you like to play regularly outside of wow, just so the listeners don't

35:36.000 --> 35:42.440
think you play wow all time, all the day, although that may be what you actually do.

35:42.440 --> 35:43.440
That's really it.

35:43.440 --> 35:44.440
That's it.

35:44.440 --> 35:45.440
Yeah.

35:45.440 --> 35:46.440
Come on.

35:46.440 --> 35:47.440
Puzzle Quest 2.

35:47.440 --> 35:48.440
I've talked about that before.

35:48.440 --> 35:49.440
Um, Zuma's Revenge.

35:49.440 --> 35:53.360
Like I just said, I played Peggle on your phone, your new iPhone 4 that we got last

35:53.360 --> 35:54.360
week.

35:54.360 --> 35:55.360
Peggle is crack.

35:55.360 --> 35:56.360
Yeah.

35:56.360 --> 35:57.360
Peggle is really awesome.

35:57.360 --> 35:58.360
All right.

35:58.360 --> 36:02.960
Um, some of our listeners are saying the stream is skipping.

36:02.960 --> 36:07.280
I don't know what's going on, but, uh, with a 12 hour show, I'm sure it's going

36:07.280 --> 36:11.040
to be a problem through a lot of it, but just to remind everybody in studio, whatever bandwidth

36:11.040 --> 36:12.040
you got to make sure.

36:12.040 --> 36:14.600
I did forget to close my torrents, so I just closed them.

36:14.600 --> 36:15.600
Uh ohs.

36:15.600 --> 36:16.600
Okay.

36:16.600 --> 36:17.600
There you go.

36:17.600 --> 36:18.600
All right.

36:18.600 --> 36:19.600
Maybe that'll help.

36:19.600 --> 36:20.600
So we'll see.

36:20.600 --> 36:22.160
Um, if it still is skipping in about 10 minutes, I'll try rebooted the stream.

36:22.160 --> 36:25.400
But meanwhile, I think I kind of asked Bradley about his game a week and he said he was doing

36:25.400 --> 36:28.320
mostly traveling, but I'll ask again if there's anything you want to throw out there, Bradley.

36:28.320 --> 36:29.320
Okay.

36:29.320 --> 36:33.440
So there was no games this week, but I want to go with my last week because I was playing

36:33.440 --> 36:38.640
a bunch of games then I played, uh, played the shadow complex that was, that's a fun

36:38.640 --> 36:39.640
game.

36:39.640 --> 36:41.120
That was for last year's summer arcade.

36:41.120 --> 36:45.320
I've actually bought all the ones for this year, even though just mainly because I bought

36:45.320 --> 36:46.320
the four of them.

36:46.320 --> 36:48.120
So I bought Monday night combat as well.

36:48.120 --> 36:52.240
I played through the demo and it's a game I probably might pay a little bit, but it's

36:52.240 --> 36:57.200
not one I'd play a lot because one of those team based combat games I'm not a big on,

36:57.200 --> 37:01.800
but, uh, uh, Castlevania HD, I didn't play that last week, but I've played through the,

37:01.800 --> 37:02.800
through the game on that.

37:02.800 --> 37:03.800
And that's fun.

37:03.800 --> 37:07.760
It's, it's kind of one thing that, yeah, as you said on one of the previous podcasts was

37:07.760 --> 37:11.600
that, uh, it was kind of weird because it's like you have a 30 minute time limit limit

37:11.600 --> 37:13.880
to find the boss and get it done.

37:13.880 --> 37:18.160
And that, that, that makes it kind of difficult because if you screw up somewhere like 22,

37:18.160 --> 37:22.280
like you're 29 minutes in, you're trying to kill the boss and you run out of time, you

37:22.280 --> 37:23.560
have to do the whole level again.

37:23.560 --> 37:27.400
So that kind of makes it hard for a one player when you do the single player.

37:27.400 --> 37:29.880
Plus it's sometimes hard to find the damn boss.

37:29.880 --> 37:33.920
Like I get lost in those maps, like, because they change every game somehow like little

37:33.920 --> 37:34.960
doors move or something.

37:34.960 --> 37:36.600
I think it's a pain.

37:36.600 --> 37:39.960
Well, that's sort of the way they deal with the HD where you change the, you can change

37:39.960 --> 37:40.960
the size of the map.

37:40.960 --> 37:45.800
You can zoom out and kind of look at, look at your map and, uh, cause some things open

37:45.800 --> 37:49.400
certain doors and once you learn the pattern and you can do it, but that's, that's how

37:49.400 --> 37:50.400
you do that one.

37:50.400 --> 37:54.840
Uh, uh, let's see what the other, other games, uh, limbo, that one's, that one's actually

37:54.840 --> 37:56.480
a pretty cool game.

37:56.480 --> 37:58.520
It's at least it's, it's worth a play.

37:58.520 --> 38:04.160
It's if it's cause it's a, it might be a bit expensive for the $15 just cause it's, if

38:04.160 --> 38:07.280
the first playthrough of it, it only took me about three and a half hours.

38:07.280 --> 38:10.600
And if, once you learn the puzzles, it only takes about, it's only an hour game, but it's

38:10.600 --> 38:14.480
definitely worth playing cause it's, cause it's really atmospheric and a pretty, some

38:14.480 --> 38:19.720
pretty cool like sort of, uh, scenes in the game, like the hotel sign that's kind of charging

38:19.720 --> 38:24.240
on and off with, uh, this, with, uh, with, uh, the electricity.

38:24.240 --> 38:29.280
So if you jump at the wrong time, you'll get, you'll get electrocuted as like really pretty

38:29.280 --> 38:30.600
cool sounds to it.

38:30.600 --> 38:36.120
Uh, also, uh, cause Hydro Thunder, Thunder Hurricane, that's fun and kind of fun playing

38:36.120 --> 38:37.120
online.

38:37.120 --> 38:38.280
They're, they're online service.

38:38.280 --> 38:43.480
The online like game thing is kind of, there's sort of a little bit screwy that if you find

38:43.480 --> 38:48.280
you're in a match and you, and you get kicked out of it or, or if it's, you don't want to

38:48.280 --> 38:51.160
play that one, you have to go back to the beginning, to the menu and then reload it.

38:51.160 --> 38:53.520
That's kind of the only bad thing about that one.

38:53.520 --> 38:59.040
Uh, let's see what the other, the other game in there, uh, Lara Croft and the Guardian

38:59.040 --> 39:00.040
of Light.

39:00.040 --> 39:01.040
Yeah.

39:01.040 --> 39:02.040
Yeah.

39:02.040 --> 39:03.040
I did play that.

39:03.040 --> 39:04.040
I played like through the first four levels.

39:04.040 --> 39:05.040
That's pretty fun.

39:05.040 --> 39:06.600
I haven't played the co-op because I don't have, I haven't had a second person there

39:06.600 --> 39:11.160
to play it, but it sounds interesting from what you said last week or two weeks ago,

39:11.160 --> 39:12.160
I think.

39:12.160 --> 39:13.160
Yeah.

39:13.160 --> 39:14.160
I was definitely a fan boy for that game.

39:14.160 --> 39:15.160
I'm not even going to lie.

39:15.160 --> 39:17.240
That was, it was kind of one of those like surprises.

39:17.240 --> 39:19.240
Like I wasn't expecting to like it as much as I did.

39:19.240 --> 39:20.240
I really wasn't.

39:20.240 --> 39:21.760
So that was, it was cool.

39:21.760 --> 39:23.920
I like the arcade feel that game a lot.

39:23.920 --> 39:25.880
Feels like, it feels like playing gauntlet kind of.

39:25.880 --> 39:26.880
Yeah.

39:26.880 --> 39:27.880
It's cool.

39:27.880 --> 39:28.880
Yeah.

39:28.880 --> 39:29.880
And also played a burnout revenge.

39:29.880 --> 39:32.840
I had been like a year, like almost like nine or eight, 10 months since I played it last,

39:32.840 --> 39:39.000
but I like the burnout games as they're, that's like arcade, like the racing simulator, simulators,

39:39.000 --> 39:43.920
but arcade racing, just fun knocking people off the road and trying to get the thing except

39:43.920 --> 39:48.080
for like the burning laps and the, and like preview races where you have to beat a certain

39:48.080 --> 39:52.560
time are really annoying because if you die, if you mess up one time, you have to restart

39:52.560 --> 39:54.520
the whole race and start over and over.

39:54.520 --> 39:58.680
It takes like an hour to get a gold on it or perfect rating on it.

39:58.680 --> 40:00.240
All right.

40:00.240 --> 40:04.200
Um, well, um, I guess that's going to do it for everybody's gaming weeks.

40:04.200 --> 40:05.560
So you all right over there?

40:05.560 --> 40:07.120
Crash knocked my fork over.

40:07.120 --> 40:11.160
I, it was my delicious food, which I'm not going to describe.

40:11.160 --> 40:12.560
It's still very garlicky.

40:12.560 --> 40:13.560
All right.

40:13.560 --> 40:14.560
Nothing wrong with garlic.

40:14.560 --> 40:15.560
All right.

40:15.560 --> 40:18.880
Let's move into some gaming news after we do some housekeeping tonight.

40:18.880 --> 40:21.480
I don't have a whole lot to add other than the, we already talked about, we're going

40:21.480 --> 40:23.800
to be going a long, long, long show tonight.

40:23.800 --> 40:26.360
Um, I'm trying to see if the skipping problems resolved.

40:26.360 --> 40:27.960
Looks like some people are saying, yeah, it's better.

40:27.960 --> 40:31.360
Some are saying it's still going, so we'll see, we'll give it a few more minutes to work

40:31.360 --> 40:32.360
itself out.

40:32.360 --> 40:37.400
Um, and otherwise I guess I'll say add us on Twitter, twitter.com slash O L R and on

40:37.400 --> 40:40.080
Facebook, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.

40:40.080 --> 40:42.920
If you follow us on there, we can give you updates so that you know, if we're going to

40:42.920 --> 40:45.480
be doing a show early or whatever's going on.

40:45.480 --> 40:47.520
Uh, all right, let's get into some news.

40:47.520 --> 40:51.640
Let's finally start talking some actual gaming news here today.

40:51.640 --> 40:54.240
Big news out of penny arcade expo, right?

40:54.240 --> 40:55.240
Loki.

40:55.240 --> 40:56.240
Oh yeah.

40:56.240 --> 41:01.880
This is kind of like a very surprising news, but you know, probably I'm sure people are

41:01.880 --> 41:03.240
taking it with a grain of salt.

41:03.240 --> 41:11.580
Duke Nukem forever is coming out 2011 on Xbox 360 PlayStation three and PC, um, is now being

41:11.580 --> 41:17.480
developed by gearbox, um, software with the help of a two K games.

41:17.480 --> 41:25.360
And uh, they are finishing with 3d realms took over 10 years to, uh, start I guess.

41:25.360 --> 41:32.240
And uh, it was playable on the show floor and um, it's everything Duke Nukem should

41:32.240 --> 41:38.840
be, you know, with, uh, you know, being able to pee everywhere and you know, blowjob into

41:38.840 --> 41:45.640
windows and, um, you know, are there strippers punching eyeballs across, you know, a football

41:45.640 --> 41:46.640
field.

41:46.640 --> 41:47.640
Good stuff.

41:47.640 --> 41:55.240
All right, here, here's where I want to start is this is obviously yay, funny gaming news,

41:55.240 --> 41:58.440
you know, like hooray, it's finally happening, but at the same time, there's a part of me

41:58.440 --> 42:02.840
that goes, okay, well look, I don't think this is really the same game that Duke Nukem

42:02.840 --> 42:05.480
forever was, was originally going to be.

42:05.480 --> 42:09.040
And um, you know, that might be kind of a duh because it's probably been like five different

42:09.040 --> 42:14.580
games over the past 13 years or however long it's been, but, um, I honestly think after

42:14.580 --> 42:21.600
the closure of 3d realms, I think these guys probably got the IP and probably nuked everything

42:21.600 --> 42:22.600
that had happened before.

42:22.600 --> 42:27.960
I mean, I know they say that they've taken what 3d realm started or whatever, but I go,

42:27.960 --> 42:33.400
they took an idea probably, or they took the idea of what Duke Nukem should be and have

42:33.400 --> 42:35.760
just kind of run with it and made it their own.

42:35.760 --> 42:37.880
That's, that's kind of what I think this game really is.

42:37.880 --> 42:42.440
And it's like, let's give it to a developer who's not going to take 13 years to finish

42:42.440 --> 42:43.440
it.

42:43.440 --> 42:47.200
It's as though they've been working on since late 2009 and says, uh, we're in the Paul's

42:47.200 --> 42:48.640
Sheen phase right now.

42:48.640 --> 42:52.680
This game, this is a game where we cannot make a promise.

42:52.680 --> 42:59.240
We cannot fulfill, uh, we need to get past the shock and awe and then we can go to all

42:59.240 --> 43:03.040
the retailers and first parties and work with our launch plan.

43:03.040 --> 43:05.560
So it will be coming out though.

43:05.560 --> 43:07.400
Um, I'm excited.

43:07.400 --> 43:12.120
I love the Duke Nukem games and to be honest, just the screenshots and the like the little

43:12.120 --> 43:16.080
cam videos that they had of the gameplay, it looks good.

43:16.080 --> 43:21.440
It looks like, you know, cause I think they're really going to kind of keep the vibe of the

43:21.440 --> 43:25.640
old games in there and it's just going to be souped up now and gearbox, you know, they've

43:25.640 --> 43:28.480
definitely got a good pedigree as far as first person shooters go.

43:28.480 --> 43:32.080
So I'm pretty confident that they'll churn out a good game.

43:32.080 --> 43:33.080
Awesome.

43:33.080 --> 43:34.080
Uh, multiplayer.

43:34.080 --> 43:35.520
They're not really showing a lot of that.

43:35.520 --> 43:38.240
There will be good multiplayer though if gearbox is involved.

43:38.240 --> 43:40.400
I hope they do like map editing and all that stuff.

43:40.400 --> 43:41.400
Although I hope so.

43:41.400 --> 43:42.760
It's kind of hard to do.

43:42.760 --> 43:46.280
I was some of the most fun part of the original Duke Nukem is looking at all those custom

43:46.280 --> 43:48.520
max maps that would come out for that.

43:48.520 --> 43:53.280
Maybe the PC version, but I don't know about the, um, three 16 PS three, uh, go to our

43:53.280 --> 43:57.440
chat room chat, that orange sounds radio.com spazzinator says Duke Nukem forever coming

43:57.440 --> 43:58.440
out.

43:58.440 --> 43:59.440
Sky did hell freeze over.

43:59.440 --> 44:00.440
What's next?

44:00.440 --> 44:04.720
Super bowl, uh, D blue guy says DNF is coming out.

44:04.720 --> 44:08.560
Next thing you know, valve might actually talk about episode three.

44:08.560 --> 44:09.560
Perish the thought.

44:09.560 --> 44:10.560
I don't know about that.

44:10.560 --> 44:14.080
I know that's a topic near and dear to your heart, Alan, right?

44:14.080 --> 44:15.680
Quaking with rage right now.

44:15.680 --> 44:16.680
Yes.

44:16.680 --> 44:22.120
Once, once portal two is out, their next press release better have half life in it.

44:22.120 --> 44:24.000
All right, we'll see.

44:24.000 --> 44:25.000
All right.

44:25.000 --> 44:26.520
Uh, let's move on to another topic.

44:26.520 --> 44:30.760
Uh, we'll know more about that game, I guess, closer to when it actually releases, which

44:30.760 --> 44:33.240
it sounds like is actually going to happen at some point.

44:33.240 --> 44:34.240
Hooray.

44:34.240 --> 44:37.040
Uh, talking about another thing that's a float around out there.

44:37.040 --> 44:40.280
I'm not sure if they're showing this at PAX, but I guess the news broke.

44:40.280 --> 44:42.240
Um, I actually heard about it.

44:42.240 --> 44:44.440
Thanks to the, um, GameStop managers conference.

44:44.440 --> 44:47.280
They were showing this, which was the week before packs.

44:47.280 --> 44:51.080
And I think a lot of the stuff that was at is at PAX now was probably at this conference

44:51.080 --> 44:54.900
like the week before, but this was one of them and it has to do with the new Xbox three

44:54.900 --> 44:56.400
60 controller.

44:56.400 --> 44:59.560
It's a redesign of the Xbox three 60 wireless controller.

44:59.560 --> 45:00.560
It's now going to be silver.

45:00.560 --> 45:05.760
It kind of has this black, white, silver look to it, uh, with only the green being in the

45:05.760 --> 45:07.620
lights for the Xbox logo.

45:07.620 --> 45:09.120
That's really the only place they are.

45:09.120 --> 45:18.960
Uh, otherwise the other big change to this, a new d-pad finally in America, they are fixing

45:18.960 --> 45:22.880
the d-pad, but not only are they fixing it, it's, it's really different.

45:22.880 --> 45:23.880
What they're doing.

45:23.880 --> 45:26.160
It's a transforming d-pad.

45:26.160 --> 45:32.400
What you can do, you can pop out the plus sign to have it just be the plus sign, or

45:32.400 --> 45:38.000
you can actually have a whole little like kind of reverse analog stick, if you will,

45:38.000 --> 45:43.280
like more of like a sunken hole type of controller, what it is now, basically kind of, yeah.

45:43.280 --> 45:47.840
So you can, you can have one or the other, uh, by doing a little rotation with that.

45:47.840 --> 45:53.080
Um, so if you want to play something like, you know, an old school street fighter game,

45:53.080 --> 45:56.520
you can pop it out one way if you're playing like a, a shooter like Halo Reach, maybe you

45:56.520 --> 45:58.280
want to do another way.

45:58.280 --> 46:00.020
Here's the interesting thing about it though, right?

46:00.020 --> 46:02.000
How much do you think this controller is going to cost?

46:02.000 --> 46:06.960
Well, I already know the answer to that, so I can't say.

46:06.960 --> 46:07.960
45.

46:07.960 --> 46:08.960
45 says.

46:08.960 --> 46:09.960
About-ish.

46:09.960 --> 46:10.960
About-ish.

46:10.960 --> 46:11.960
Here's the thing.

46:11.960 --> 46:12.960
It's $64.99 for this new controller.

46:12.960 --> 46:14.160
You know why?

46:14.160 --> 46:19.720
They're only selling it with the play and charge kit as a bundle, and it's a limited

46:19.720 --> 46:20.960
edition.

46:20.960 --> 46:24.520
And there's a part of me that kind of goes like, like looks in that, looks at that and

46:24.520 --> 46:27.080
goes, you little shits.

46:27.080 --> 46:31.320
Like you know your controller is a problem.

46:31.320 --> 46:33.960
You've known this for a long time.

46:33.960 --> 46:40.560
You've fixed it with limited releases, like some sort of tease, like time again in Europe.

46:40.560 --> 46:44.880
And now you think you're finally releasing something kind of a step beyond that here.

46:44.880 --> 46:48.260
You're going to gouge for it when it's like a problem in the first place.

46:48.260 --> 46:51.040
Like you suck.

46:51.040 --> 46:52.040
You're a dick.

46:52.040 --> 46:53.480
Whoever thought of this?

46:53.480 --> 46:58.560
I mean, I like the look to the controller though, even though it is a little weird that

46:58.560 --> 47:02.440
like the buttons are not that yellow, blue, red, green color.

47:02.440 --> 47:06.360
Yeah, that's going to be wonderful for, I don't know, players that are new and that

47:06.360 --> 47:14.400
they have like color, you know, little indicators and stuff on the screen that correspond to

47:14.400 --> 47:15.400
those buttons.

47:15.400 --> 47:19.000
Oh, the buttons don't have colors because they're black and white.

47:19.000 --> 47:21.600
Why even, why did they do that?

47:21.600 --> 47:24.120
That's just dumb.

47:24.120 --> 47:29.240
The only way that I would see that being acceptable is if they were like backlit with those actual

47:29.240 --> 47:30.240
colors.

47:30.240 --> 47:33.700
So it looks gray when it's turned off, but actually has colors shining through when you

47:33.700 --> 47:35.400
turn it on.

47:35.400 --> 47:36.960
But that's not the case with this.

47:36.960 --> 47:40.480
That's just them being dumb.

47:40.480 --> 47:44.480
Monty Boggs in our chat room says, I'm sure the only thing limited is the bundle and color.

47:44.480 --> 47:46.600
They will continue with the new D pad.

47:46.600 --> 47:47.600
Hmm.

47:47.600 --> 47:48.800
I hope you're right on that.

47:48.800 --> 47:49.800
I don't know.

47:49.800 --> 47:51.840
They haven't really said on that though.

47:51.840 --> 47:53.560
Maybe this is a trial thing.

47:53.560 --> 47:57.500
This is a trick to get you to buy it right now for $65.

47:57.500 --> 47:59.220
So we'll see.

47:59.220 --> 48:01.520
They're trying to get you suckers on an impulse buy.

48:01.520 --> 48:02.520
That's what it is.

48:02.520 --> 48:03.520
I don't know.

48:03.520 --> 48:04.520
All right.

48:04.520 --> 48:05.520
Uh, let's move on.

48:05.520 --> 48:06.520
Dark soccer.

48:06.520 --> 48:07.520
What do you got for us?

48:07.520 --> 48:13.740
Well, in the realm of a PlayStation, it actually, uh, they were sending out a survey seeing

48:13.740 --> 48:21.180
if people would be interested in, um, having the, uh, a digital comic service, um, on the

48:21.180 --> 48:24.840
PS3 and not just on the PSP.

48:24.840 --> 48:29.160
And um, so I'm not sure if they're actually going to do that now, but I mean, it would

48:29.160 --> 48:32.840
be kind of neat being able to read my comics on the TV.

48:32.840 --> 48:37.840
Although honestly I can just look at my digital comics on my computer and we have a computer

48:37.840 --> 48:39.260
hooked up to our TV in the front room.

48:39.260 --> 48:40.480
So big diff.

48:40.480 --> 48:45.480
Um, I think nothing's really going to replace, you know, actually having paper in your hand

48:45.480 --> 48:51.960
and reading the comic and going, who pretty, you know, but for those that want it, it's

48:51.960 --> 48:52.960
available.

48:52.960 --> 48:53.960
Well, good for them.

48:53.960 --> 48:58.220
I mean, if they want to use, if Sony wants to do it good for them, maybe they'll get

48:58.220 --> 48:59.280
something out of it.

48:59.280 --> 49:04.000
I don't know that it's going to be worth the expenditure.

49:04.000 --> 49:06.900
I read comics on my iPhone, you know, having it handheld.

49:06.900 --> 49:09.720
That's one thing, but yeah, those are a little more portable, you know?

49:09.720 --> 49:13.480
You don't have to take a book that you'd worry about ruining, you know?

49:13.480 --> 49:16.240
Oh, I'm at work right now and I want to read a comic.

49:16.240 --> 49:19.160
I mean, I'm not at work and want to read a comic.

49:19.160 --> 49:20.160
I'm on my lunch.

49:20.160 --> 49:22.520
Yeah, I'm on my lunch break and want to read a comic.

49:22.520 --> 49:28.840
I have my break sign up all day.

49:28.840 --> 49:32.320
I'm surprised you haven't brought this up in your comic podcast yet because that's you,

49:32.320 --> 49:35.680
you tape those, you taped a comic podcast this morning, right?

49:35.680 --> 49:38.160
Yeah, but we focus more on the comics themselves.

49:38.160 --> 49:39.160
I see.

49:39.160 --> 49:40.160
Where, where can they download that?

49:40.160 --> 49:44.080
I'll let you work in a cheap plug for your new old spinoff show.

49:44.080 --> 49:47.320
Infamous gamers.net is the site.

49:47.320 --> 49:51.760
It's no I, there's just an N. The letter N. Yeah, nice.

49:51.760 --> 49:55.000
And um, oh, it's actually just infamous.net.

49:55.000 --> 49:56.000
Yeah.

49:56.000 --> 49:57.960
It used to be infamous gamers.com.

49:57.960 --> 50:04.000
Um, but in the meantime though, you also can find easier links right now on our various

50:04.000 --> 50:05.420
Twitters and whatnot.

50:05.420 --> 50:06.420
Very cool.

50:06.420 --> 50:07.420
Yeah.

50:07.420 --> 50:08.420
All right.

50:08.420 --> 50:09.420
Thanks for your time.

50:09.420 --> 50:11.680
And you're totally a sucker for having done that already this morning.

50:11.680 --> 50:15.080
So you've already been broadcasting for an hour or two, right?

50:15.080 --> 50:16.680
We were Skype casting.

50:16.680 --> 50:17.680
Skype casting.

50:17.680 --> 50:18.680
That works.

50:18.680 --> 50:19.680
That's how we do it is Skype.

50:19.680 --> 50:20.680
And when do your new episodes come out?

50:20.680 --> 50:21.680
Cause you tape today.

50:21.680 --> 50:23.520
And every so often we get Dalek voice.

50:23.520 --> 50:25.080
You tape today, but it'll come out what?

50:25.080 --> 50:26.080
Tomorrow?

50:26.080 --> 50:27.080
Tomorrow.

50:27.080 --> 50:28.080
Okay, very cool.

50:28.080 --> 50:29.960
So I've got, after we're done here, I've got editing to do.

50:29.960 --> 50:30.960
Fun.

50:30.960 --> 50:31.960
Good luck with that.

50:31.960 --> 50:32.960
Uh, all right.

50:32.960 --> 50:33.960
All right.

50:33.960 --> 50:37.440
Moving on to more stories, Loki.

50:37.440 --> 50:42.440
So um, it's kind of funny, um, Medal of Honor, you know, a big game that's going to be coming

50:42.440 --> 50:50.040
out from ETH, um, EA this October, uh, is actually banned from military, um, bases.

50:50.040 --> 50:55.240
At least, uh, Gamestop's located in military, um, bases.

50:55.240 --> 51:03.960
Apparently, uh, this is a decision, I guess, um, by Gamestop and also with, um, I believe,

51:03.960 --> 51:12.920
uh, they said, uh, the PX commanding general, uh, was it the commanding general of the army

51:12.920 --> 51:18.480
and air forces exchange services, I guess I made the decision about that.

51:18.480 --> 51:24.180
Um, so it says Gamestop has agreed out of respect for our past and present men and women

51:24.180 --> 51:25.180
in uniform.

51:25.180 --> 51:30.160
We will not carry Medal of Honor in any of our AAFES based stores.

51:30.160 --> 51:35.360
At this time, it does not include our four stores on marine installations.

51:35.360 --> 51:43.320
Um, Gamestop fully supports the AAFES and in this endeavor and it's, and it is sensitive

51:43.320 --> 51:50.480
to the fact in multiplayer mode, uh, one side will assume the role of Taliban fighters.

51:50.480 --> 51:56.680
As such, Gamestop has agreed to, um, have all marketing materials pulled by noon today

51:56.680 --> 52:02.720
and stop taking reservations, customers who entered our AAFES stores and wish to reserve

52:02.720 --> 52:07.720
Medal of Honor, uh, can and should be directed to the nearest Gamestop location off base.

52:07.720 --> 52:14.760
Again, we appreciate the sensitivity and know, um, our AAFES based stores will continue to

52:14.760 --> 52:20.240
honor, um, the great customer base in which they serve.

52:20.240 --> 52:24.040
And of course that is because the Taliban are in multiplayer.

52:24.040 --> 52:28.640
Oh yes, because, you know, our soldiers can go and fight, you know, in Iraq and stuff

52:28.640 --> 52:33.360
like that, but oh my God, the Taliban's in a video game and then we're going to flip

52:33.360 --> 52:36.200
out because they can't handle that.

52:36.200 --> 52:37.920
It's dumb.

52:37.920 --> 52:41.920
That's just like saying we should remove all the Germans out of Call of Duty because, you

52:41.920 --> 52:49.280
know, they offended people in World War II and the Holocaust and stuff like that.

52:49.280 --> 52:52.620
You know, we should, uh, we should stop selling those games everywhere because people were

52:52.620 --> 52:56.320
affected by the Holocaust.

52:56.320 --> 52:57.320
I don't know.

52:57.320 --> 52:58.840
I would find it a little weird in the first place.

52:58.840 --> 53:05.920
I mean, not weird, but I would like when I'm not working, I don't want to like think about

53:05.920 --> 53:07.920
and do work, if that makes sense.

53:07.920 --> 53:09.840
Like, and I know Medal of Honor is fake.

53:09.840 --> 53:10.840
Okay.

53:10.840 --> 53:15.100
But still it's kind of like when you're working, you know, you're doing all this military stuff

53:15.100 --> 53:20.160
and then when you are off, you want to continue to do military stuff in a game.

53:20.160 --> 53:23.520
Like, don't you want to play like Mario Kart or something?

53:23.520 --> 53:24.520
Don't they understand?

53:24.520 --> 53:31.040
I understand that, you know, that the Taliban are, you know, not good people, but it's a

53:31.040 --> 53:32.040
video game.

53:32.040 --> 53:36.800
It'd be like, if you replace the Taliban with space aliens, it's still the opposing team.

53:36.800 --> 53:37.800
That's all it is.

53:37.800 --> 53:38.800
It's not real Taliban.

53:38.800 --> 53:42.160
When you play the game and kill people with the Taliban in there, it doesn't really kill

53:42.160 --> 53:43.680
real people in real life.

53:43.680 --> 53:44.680
Okay.

53:44.680 --> 53:45.680
It is a game.

53:45.680 --> 53:53.400
And if you're offended by that game, you know, then you don't have to buy it, you know.

53:53.400 --> 53:58.200
And besides, isn't that what you're fighting for, our freedom, you know, and the freedom

53:58.200 --> 53:59.200
of expression.

53:59.200 --> 54:02.200
I mean, this is kind of an art form, I guess.

54:02.200 --> 54:04.880
And if you're offended by it, well then don't buy it.

54:04.880 --> 54:05.880
Oil.

54:05.880 --> 54:12.240
Well, yeah, I understand it's oil as well, but I mean, there's still the fighting for

54:12.240 --> 54:15.880
freedom kind of crap because, you know, you're trying to save everybody from the terrorists.

54:15.880 --> 54:19.320
So I just, I don't understand what the big deal is.

54:19.320 --> 54:23.640
What's also interesting is that they're really not the first, you know, um, country U.S.

54:23.640 --> 54:27.360
to take issue with this because I think we had a story on the show last week, right,

54:27.360 --> 54:30.600
about the British had a problem with this game too.

54:30.600 --> 54:35.360
And we're talking about banning it, I think, in Britain completely with this.

54:35.360 --> 54:37.360
Well, let me put it this way.

54:37.360 --> 54:40.900
GameStop is not the only store on those military bases.

54:40.900 --> 54:44.440
And you know, they may not be carrying it, but other stores will.

54:44.440 --> 54:46.900
So all that means to them is just lost sales.

54:46.900 --> 54:48.480
So have at it.

54:48.480 --> 54:50.160
Because you know what?

54:50.160 --> 54:53.520
I think most military people will not care.

54:53.520 --> 54:56.040
Redertainment in our chatroom kind of reiterates a point here.

54:56.040 --> 55:00.640
We also support the ability of people in the military to go off base and buy the game.

55:00.640 --> 55:03.360
Again, go off base and buy the game.

55:03.360 --> 55:07.160
So you know, it's not like the game is banned altogether.

55:07.160 --> 55:11.240
I mean, that would kind of be against the Constitution, but you know, they just, they

55:11.240 --> 55:13.640
don't have to support it, I suppose.

55:13.640 --> 55:19.500
So it's just something that they did because they think it's, you know, out of respect

55:19.500 --> 55:22.920
to those who serve, we will not be stocking this game.

55:22.920 --> 55:28.080
And they apologize for any inconvenience it may have caused.

55:28.080 --> 55:30.640
But at the same time, they're like, well, just go off base and buy it.

55:30.640 --> 55:31.640
I don't understand.

55:31.640 --> 55:34.400
I don't understand what the big deal is then.

55:34.400 --> 55:38.280
If you were saying, oh, well, we don't want it on the base because that sets the wrong

55:38.280 --> 55:39.280
precedent.

55:39.280 --> 55:41.600
But you can buy it off base and bring it back in.

55:41.600 --> 55:42.600
That's fine.

55:42.600 --> 55:43.600
All right.

55:43.600 --> 55:47.640
Let's talk about something a little less serious than these types of games and talk about something

55:47.640 --> 55:49.720
a little more casual, shall we?

55:49.720 --> 55:52.700
This is also news that's coming out of Penny Arcade Expo.

55:52.700 --> 55:56.480
It's a brand new crossover game from Telltale Games.

55:56.480 --> 56:00.560
You might remember there was a teaser that I believe we brought up on the show last week.

56:00.560 --> 56:06.480
So let's see, if you could imagine, what would Homestar Runner, the guys from Penny Arcade,

56:06.480 --> 56:12.440
Sam and Max, and now Team Fortress 2 characters, what are they all going to do on their, in

56:12.440 --> 56:14.080
a new game together?

56:14.080 --> 56:15.080
Plush it up?

56:15.080 --> 56:16.080
Nope.

56:16.080 --> 56:17.520
They're going to play poker.

56:17.520 --> 56:20.000
That is the new game coming out from Telltale Games.

56:20.000 --> 56:21.600
It's a poker game.

56:21.600 --> 56:23.520
It's called Poker Night at the Inventory.

56:23.520 --> 56:27.360
It comes out for the PC and the Mac for only five bucks this fall.

56:27.360 --> 56:29.200
So at least it's, you know, kind of cheap.

56:29.200 --> 56:30.880
It's going to support Steamworks.

56:30.880 --> 56:33.000
That's why Team Fortress is now a part of this.

56:33.000 --> 56:35.960
It's going to be, you know, really integrating Steam and all that.

56:35.960 --> 56:40.800
They say there are, quote, more than a few surprises still in store.

56:40.800 --> 56:43.360
They are apparently showing off the game right now at PAX.

56:43.360 --> 56:46.000
They've got posters and all that good stuff.

56:46.000 --> 56:50.880
Dan Connors, the CEO of Telltale, quote, we've had the idea for some time of exploring the

56:50.880 --> 56:56.160
idea of what video game characters do when they're not on the clock in the games we play.

56:56.160 --> 56:59.520
We pitched the idea to friends in the industry and it really resonated.

56:59.520 --> 57:03.680
We all had a great time imagining what these guys would banter about while slinging cards

57:03.680 --> 57:07.080
from their Poker Night at the Inventory was born.

57:07.080 --> 57:09.880
So it sounds like this game is going to have a lot of smack talking in it, which might

57:09.880 --> 57:13.560
be kind of cool because like Homestar Runner talking shit will actually be really funny,

57:13.560 --> 57:14.560
I think.

57:14.560 --> 57:15.560
And some of these...

57:15.560 --> 57:18.920
I think you're a stupid poopy head.

57:18.920 --> 57:22.040
So we'll see.

57:22.040 --> 57:25.060
What I think is another thing to kind of draw out of that quote.

57:25.060 --> 57:28.400
We pitched the idea to friends in the industry.

57:28.400 --> 57:35.360
So they got this guy from Valve, the Team Fortress 2 dude is in here, as one of the

57:35.360 --> 57:36.800
playable characters.

57:36.800 --> 57:39.160
So my thought is, who else are they talking to?

57:39.160 --> 57:40.600
What other characters are going to show up?

57:40.600 --> 57:44.640
I bet some other big heavy hitter PC titles come into this too.

57:44.640 --> 57:47.140
I don't think it's just going to end here.

57:47.140 --> 57:49.700
There could be some other crossovers coming into this.

57:49.700 --> 57:50.700
So you know...

57:50.700 --> 57:53.560
Should have Shell just sitting there being quiet or Gordon Freeman sitting there being

57:53.560 --> 57:54.560
quiet.

57:54.560 --> 57:55.560
They're not supposed to say anything the whole time.

57:55.560 --> 57:56.560
You never know.

57:56.560 --> 57:57.560
Anything's possible.

57:57.560 --> 57:58.960
But they're not supposed to say anything.

57:58.960 --> 57:59.960
I don't know.

57:59.960 --> 58:02.440
Any other characters you guys think might fit in here?

58:02.440 --> 58:04.400
Hopefully some of the dudes from Back to the Future.

58:04.400 --> 58:05.400
C-Man.

58:05.400 --> 58:08.680
How about a velociraptor from the new Jurassic Park game?

58:08.680 --> 58:09.680
I think C-Man.

58:09.680 --> 58:10.680
C-Man?

58:10.680 --> 58:11.680
You know, when he's a frog.

58:11.680 --> 58:12.680
You should be C-Frog.

58:12.680 --> 58:17.400
I'm thinking more like PC oriented games, you know, because this is all about PC.

58:17.400 --> 58:18.400
GLaDOS.

58:18.400 --> 58:20.200
Oh, GLaDOS would be a good one.

58:20.200 --> 58:21.400
That would be a great one.

58:21.400 --> 58:23.800
All you have is the poker sphere.

58:23.800 --> 58:27.040
Um, maybe the chick from Mirror's Edge.

58:27.040 --> 58:29.400
I could see, you know, EA and Steam have a close relationship.

58:29.400 --> 58:37.440
And one of the unicorns from that stupid game on Steam.

58:37.440 --> 58:38.920
The pink honest game.

58:38.920 --> 58:39.920
Yeah.

58:39.920 --> 58:40.920
Yeah.

58:40.920 --> 58:46.560
Or what is, if you're talking PC, you know, how about an orc and a night elf?

58:46.560 --> 58:50.800
Although, you know, typically Blizzard doesn't do anything with Steam because they can do

58:50.800 --> 58:51.800
their own thing.

58:51.800 --> 58:53.800
Or Rinky trying to swiddle everyone other money.

58:53.800 --> 58:57.960
Retertainment says Lady Gaga should just be a character in the poker game.

58:57.960 --> 58:59.760
Completely off topic, Rob.

58:59.760 --> 59:01.720
She can show her puh-puh-puh poker face.

59:01.720 --> 59:03.880
Did you see the link that I put up on Facebook?

59:03.880 --> 59:04.880
No.

59:04.880 --> 59:08.520
Someone making Para Para dances to Lady Gaga.

59:08.520 --> 59:10.240
Some people have too much time on their hands.

59:10.240 --> 59:14.440
It was actually kind of good, but I put it up there and you didn't even look.

59:14.440 --> 59:15.440
I'm sorry.

59:15.440 --> 59:16.440
When did you put it up?

59:16.440 --> 59:17.440
Yesterday.

59:17.440 --> 59:18.560
Well, I've been busy the past couple days.

59:18.560 --> 59:20.760
I was, I was busy sleeping yesterday.

59:20.760 --> 59:21.840
I'll have you know.

59:21.840 --> 59:22.840
You hoe.

59:22.840 --> 59:23.840
Two naps.

59:23.840 --> 59:24.840
Yeah.

59:24.840 --> 59:26.840
What's this, Alan?

59:26.840 --> 59:29.480
Rob took two naps yesterday.

59:29.480 --> 59:30.480
Two two-hour naps.

59:30.480 --> 59:31.480
An old man.

59:31.480 --> 59:32.480
He's very cute.

59:32.480 --> 59:33.480
Shut up.

59:33.480 --> 59:34.480
Don't judge me.

59:34.480 --> 59:35.480
Oh, Jay Dizzle.

59:35.480 --> 59:36.480
Perfect answer.

59:36.480 --> 59:39.480
Duke Nukem should be in the game.

59:39.480 --> 59:40.480
Hello?

59:40.480 --> 59:42.480
Because, you know, it's going to be a big release coming up.

59:42.480 --> 59:43.480
I like that answer.

59:43.480 --> 59:44.480
All right.

59:44.480 --> 59:48.120
Anyhow, let's move on and talk about more gaming news.

59:48.120 --> 59:51.640
These dates coming up in just a moment, but first, Dark Sakura has something for us.

59:51.640 --> 59:54.720
Mine's not really so much of a story, so much as an impression.

59:54.720 --> 01:00:00.800
The new screen caps for the Mortal Kombat game that's coming out are up and it looks

01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:01.800
really fun.

01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:06.080
You know, I was talking to somebody that was at the GameStop Managers Conference they were

01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:08.520
showing this game and I was hearing a lot of good things about it.

01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:09.520
Here's my thing.

01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:12.360
I thought that the new Mortal Kombat game was supposed to be an arcade game.

01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:16.600
At least that was the impression I got when I first saw it, but like very much no at this

01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:17.600
point, right?

01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:21.800
It is definitely looking like a full $60 retail release, correct?

01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:22.800
Yeah.

01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:23.800
That's what the word is.

01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:28.840
I mean, it's just, but I'm looking really at what I'm telling just from the images and

01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:33.520
it seems to me like, like there's this one scene in here with Katana, let me find her,

01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:37.280
where she's just covered in blood and it's fantastic.

01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:45.560
And you're like, and Melina has her horrible, ugly eat your face face and everything just

01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:52.600
looks like what Mortal Kombat used to be except for being, you know, 3D instead of being,

01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:54.920
you know, the motion cap.

01:00:54.920 --> 01:00:59.000
Like I'm not gonna lie, Mortal Kombat is one of those games that I really shouldn't like,

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:00.000
but I do.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:04.520
Like, I really like the Mortal Kombat series and I'm really excited for this game.

01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:07.880
And I'm, you know what, there's just some guilty pleasure games and Mortal Kombat is

01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:08.880
one of them.

01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:14.160
To be fair, I didn't play the DC Universe game, but I played pretty much all the others.

01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:20.200
I really enjoyed the first couple, what was it, Deception and there was another one in

01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:21.200
there too.

01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:24.760
Not the last one they did with all the, thank you, Deadly Alliance.

01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:26.000
That was actually a decent game.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.000
Deadly Alliance is awesome.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:28.880
I love the little RPG thing in there.

01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:32.200
Yeah, you know, even those mini modes, some of them were kind of stupid, like in Deception

01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:35.640
they had the kart racing and stuff, which were definitely an afterthought, but I ate

01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:36.640
that shit up.

01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:37.640
I thought it was awesome.

01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:41.920
I'm totally digging this particular level on this picture with the big colosseum.

01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:42.920
That looks cool.

01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:47.160
I have another one here that's inside of a clock tower.

01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:49.880
Oh, you know someone's getting thrown through that clock.

01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:52.600
Well, not just through the clock, I'm thinking that they're going to get ground up by the

01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:53.600
gears.

01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:54.600
Awesome.

01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:55.600
And that would be fantastic.

01:01:55.600 --> 01:02:00.160
I want there to be special stage fatalities for every stage.

01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:01.160
I hope so.

01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:02.160
Because I want more blood.

01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:07.760
It sounds like these new IP owners, what Warner Brothers is taking care of this now after

01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:11.040
Midway, although a lot of the people that used to be involved are involved now, it really

01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:13.400
sounds like they're just like, okay.

01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:15.600
After that DC- They interviewed Ed Boon about it a few months

01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:16.600
ago.

01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:17.600
Yeah.

01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:20.600
After that DC Universe game, let's just give the fans what they want.

01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:22.840
Let's just go balls to the wall.

01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:28.240
We want like a Street Fighter 4-esque type of upgrade, like, cause you know, Street Fighter

01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:32.200
4 was like a fucking awesome upgrade from, you know, old school Street Fighter.

01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:34.880
So like, I think that's what they're going to give us with this new Mortal Kombat game.

01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:40.480
I'm looking at this red guy here and he's throwing the scorpion little chain thing.

01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:45.520
Is that Ermac, or is that the ninja from Deadly Alliance, whatever his name was?

01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:46.520
I can't remember his name.

01:02:46.520 --> 01:02:49.200
I don't know, but there's another thing that I wouldn't mind seeing.

01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:50.200
I think he's Ermac.

01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:54.680
You remember Soul Calibers create a fighter thing and that you can create certain ones

01:02:54.680 --> 01:02:56.800
that have actually a story to it?

01:02:56.800 --> 01:03:01.500
I think that would be- It's a little hit and miss with me because

01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:06.740
like in that one, the last Xbox game they did that let you do that, it was a little

01:03:06.740 --> 01:03:07.740
bit janky.

01:03:07.740 --> 01:03:09.400
Like it just was too much at that point.

01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:10.400
It was too much.

01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:16.120
It was just reptile, spitting, splashy, acid vomit.

01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:18.320
They do a pretty good job on the Soul Caliber games though.

01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:19.320
I will give you that.

01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:22.680
Like probably my second favorite series of fighting games behind Mortal Kombat, and yes,

01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:25.280
even above Street Fighter, is Soul Caliber.

01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:30.740
Like those games are really bad ass and I'm really waiting for news on Soul Caliber 5.

01:03:30.740 --> 01:03:34.560
Like I'm kind of sitting here going, okay, it's about time to hear about Soul Caliber

01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:37.400
5 because, you know, the Yoda and Darth Vader days have long passed.

01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:39.640
So I'd like to know what's up with that.

01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:41.600
Where's like the robot dude?

01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:42.600
Cyrax.

01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:46.640
So I like that they've pulled a lot of the stuff that people liked from the other series.

01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:49.120
I've actually got high hopes for this.

01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:52.680
For any of our friends though that are at PAX, I want to hear what you think about it.

01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:57.080
I'm liking that it looks like a lot of the roster from Mortal Kombat 3, except they kind

01:03:57.080 --> 01:04:01.820
of, at least so far, looks like they've said sia to a lot of the characters that just really

01:04:01.820 --> 01:04:03.200
weren't notable out of those games.

01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:04.200
Like Stryker.

01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:05.200
Like, you know, who- I liked him.

01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:06.200
Who played Stryker?

01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:07.200
Oh, come on.

01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:08.200
I did play him actually.

01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:09.200
Oh, come on.

01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:10.200
He was-

01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:14.000
If you knew how to use him right, he was really, really awesome.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:17.960
And he had that particular- he had this like one punch combo that was super sweet.

01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:18.960
I will say-

01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:19.960
In Mortal Kombat 3.

01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:20.960
I loved Kabal.

01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:22.280
I did- I played Kabal.

01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:23.280
He was awesome.

01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:28.040
And I don't think he's really coming back because he wasn't really notable in the mythology-

01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:29.280
He had the run thing.

01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:30.920
Yeah, that was cheap.

01:04:30.920 --> 01:04:32.560
And I loved Sindel.

01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:33.560
I loved Sindel.

01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:37.480
Sindel was badass, but again, what was she really there to do?

01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:41.480
She was there to be the one dude's wife and then she kind of disappears.

01:04:41.480 --> 01:04:44.920
Like she didn't really- or no, she's Katana's mom though, isn't she?

01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:45.920
I think so.

01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:48.400
And the other one was the Goro chick.

01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:50.960
Yeah, she- I didn't care for her.

01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:51.960
What?

01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:52.960
Shiva.

01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:53.960
That was it.

01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:54.960
I didn't care for her.

01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:55.960
Like, oh, what a derivative name that is.

01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:56.960
Yeah.

01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:59.240
But I really like Sindel and her scream thing.

01:04:59.240 --> 01:05:03.560
But yeah, so I mean, and really, like I said, it's not exactly a story.

01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:07.040
And if anyone wants to see the images, just go to Eurogamer.net.

01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:11.840
But they're really- I'm actually excited about a Mortal Kombat game.

01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:16.120
Vidpower in our chatroom says, Striker is the Dan of the Mortal Kombat universe.

01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:20.360
Hey, if you can win a game with Dan, you're pretty awesome, right?

01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:22.480
Nice, I like that.

01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:27.620
Derek H. in our chatroom, by the way, I neglected to say this last week on the show, and I really

01:05:27.620 --> 01:05:31.620
need to give a big holler and thank you to Derek H. for the big battle which wrapped

01:05:31.620 --> 01:05:33.340
up last week.

01:05:33.340 --> 01:05:36.760
Even though we got our butts kicked by the host country, Dead Picks Alive, you know how

01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:38.840
that usually happens in the Olympics?

01:05:38.840 --> 01:05:42.400
The host country usually wins, and Dead Picks Alive won.

01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:45.440
We made a really good job second place, so thank you to all the listeners who helped

01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:46.440
out in the big battle there.

01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:49.000
And I just want to give kudos to Derek for putting that all together, because I know

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:52.440
it's a pain in the ass to do those types of large-scale tournaments.

01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:58.360
Hence why we don't do them a lot anymore, so good job to him, appreciate it.

01:05:58.360 --> 01:06:02.780
He says in our chatroom, that's the defense of everyone who likes crappy characters.

01:06:02.780 --> 01:06:04.840
If you know how to use them, he's great.

01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:06.920
I do the same thing with Cammie.

01:06:06.920 --> 01:06:10.440
Cammie's actually a good character too.

01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:12.240
Uh-oh, Alan?

01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:16.240
Just like, his eyes got really big, and he's looking like, I'm gonna cut this bitch.

01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:17.240
Dan hates Cammie.

01:06:17.240 --> 01:06:18.240
Dan hates Cammie.

01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:19.240
Dan Jelly from the other room.

01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:20.880
Okay, so you like Cammie, right?

01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:22.880
Yes, yes, she's amazing.

01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:27.920
And my favorite thing that she does is the little mid-air combos where she spins and

01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:29.920
then goes into a different kick or a punch or something.

01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:32.040
What were they called, the hooligan combos, I think?

01:06:32.040 --> 01:06:33.480
Here's my thing with Cammie.

01:06:33.480 --> 01:06:38.360
I like her as a character, and you know Kylie Minogue playing her in the movie was the best

01:06:38.360 --> 01:06:39.360
thing ever.

01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:40.920
That was the only good thing about the movie.

01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:46.280
Like I like her as a character, but as a street fighter, god I hate her.

01:06:46.280 --> 01:06:49.400
Like she's just, she's so useless.

01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:52.480
Actually no, I take that back, T-Hawk is probably the most useless street fighter.

01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:53.480
T-Hawk actually-

01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:55.240
She just has a nice ass, that's about it.

01:06:55.240 --> 01:06:57.400
They drew her with a nice ass.

01:06:57.400 --> 01:06:59.700
That's really the only addition to her.

01:06:59.700 --> 01:07:01.560
This is my thing.

01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:05.720
It doesn't matter how much someone says a character sucks, if you enjoy playing them

01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:09.280
and you're good at them, everybody else better watch out.

01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:13.740
That is the, that's the trash talking roots of the gaming universe, you know?

01:07:13.740 --> 01:07:17.960
What you believe to be true is law and everybody else is stupid.

01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:18.960
That's really what-

01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:23.400
And I think everybody can agree that she would probably look better naked than T-Hawk anyways,

01:07:23.400 --> 01:07:24.400
so yeah.

01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:28.080
T-Hawk would be disproportionate if he actually didn't have clothes on.

01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:29.080
Anyway.

01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:30.080
No penis.

01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:37.720
Anyway, but the whole, the whole point is, you know, it's just like with video games,

01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:38.720
you know?

01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:42.520
The game's only as good as the system, you know, they're on, well I mean, not the system

01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:43.520
they're on.

01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:44.520
A game-

01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:46.400
A system is only as good as the games that are on it.

01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:50.520
Well then a character is only as good as the player playing.

01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:56.040
Yeah, take my cami bashing with a grain of salt because I love Faye Long.

01:07:56.040 --> 01:07:59.080
Like he's my favorite character in Street Fighter.

01:07:59.080 --> 01:08:01.080
I think he's badass.

01:08:01.080 --> 01:08:04.920
I enjoy playing Sakura, but that's just because she's fun because she does her little hop

01:08:04.920 --> 01:08:05.920
thing.

01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:06.920
You playing Sakura?

01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:09.520
Karin was really good.

01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:13.680
One of my favorite characters in the Alpha series that made it into four that really

01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:17.280
just does not play well in four at all is Rose.

01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:21.320
She is amazing, but she's really hard to play and crap in four.

01:08:21.320 --> 01:08:22.320
But cami is awesome.

01:08:22.320 --> 01:08:26.240
I'll kick your ass as cami.

01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:31.600
I remember what my old Let's Piss Off Dan team was, was Gambit and cami.

01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:32.600
Good times.

01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:34.320
In X-Men vs. Street Fighter when we first got together.

01:08:34.320 --> 01:08:36.840
Can't wait for the new Marvel vs. Capcom game, it's gonna be good times.

01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:38.840
Dan, look at the Saturn!

01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:39.840
Alright.

01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:43.920
Alright, anyhow, let's move on to some release dates, traveling the world after our little

01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:46.640
fighting game derailment there, that's alright.

01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:47.640
Let's travel the world and talk about-

01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:48.880
Hey, we've got time to fill.

01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:52.000
That's true, we do have lots of time to fill, although I know, I don't know what time Loki

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:55.120
has to go, but we'll figure it out.

01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:57.120
So, release dates, Loki.

01:08:57.120 --> 01:08:59.880
Yes, there's some decent stuff coming out this week.

01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:05.480
It's starting to ramp up a little bit because we're getting into the long fourth quarter.

01:09:05.480 --> 01:09:10.880
So starting things off, Batman the Brave and the Bold on Wii and DS this week.

01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:17.320
Spider-Man Shattered Dimensions on Playstation 3, Xbox 360, Wii and DS.

01:09:17.320 --> 01:09:23.480
Tom Clancy's Hawks 2 on Playstation 3, Xbox 360.

01:09:23.480 --> 01:09:28.720
And the Wii version comes out later, if that's right.

01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:34.160
Oddly enough, if you really want to buy games before you can actually play them, there's

01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:38.680
some Playstation Move games coming out this week, including iPad.

01:09:38.680 --> 01:09:43.000
Unfortunately, since the Move doesn't come out for a couple weeks, you can stare at the

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.480
nice little case for a while.

01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:48.040
That'll be available on Playstation 3.

01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:52.280
NHL 11 on Playstation 3, Xbox 360.

01:09:52.280 --> 01:09:58.400
Midnight Mysteries, the Edgar Allen Poe conspiracy on Nintendo DS.

01:09:58.400 --> 01:09:59.400
Kingdom Hearts.

01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:04.440
I will be buying that game, quote the raven, nevermore.

01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:08.000
Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep coming out on the PSP.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
No PSP Go, though.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:11.000
Do you want?

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:17.240
NHL Slap Shot, that's the crappy Wii game with the hockey stick controller.

01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:21.320
Yeah, you're not going to break a TV with that.

01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:22.320
Sports Champions.

01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:23.320
That's the fun part.

01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:27.840
When you're at your friend's house and he beats you in NHL, whatever, whatever, and

01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:30.920
he's like, yeah, hi, beat you, you suck.

01:10:30.920 --> 01:10:34.620
You can just start bashing the TV in with your controller saying, huh, well I fucked

01:10:34.620 --> 01:10:37.280
up your TV, later, bitch.

01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:42.840
Sports Champions, the Wii Sports type game for the Playstation Move.

01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:47.440
Once again, this will make a nice coaster for the next two weeks.

01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:49.440
Saints Row Double Pack.

01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:55.800
That's a re-release of the two Saints Row games on Xbox 360 for only $29.99.

01:10:55.800 --> 01:11:01.520
There's also a, let's see here, Brunswick Cosmic Bowling game, which I'm sure is not

01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:04.840
terrible at all on the Wii.

01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:11.320
Rooz, it's the real-time strategy game that you can bluff in on Xbox 360 and Playstation

01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:12.320
3.

01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:16.120
And Assault on Balleria.

01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:20.040
Looks like that's how you pronounce that, I probably fucked that up.

01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:22.560
That's on PC.

01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:23.560
Start the Party.

01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:28.880
It's going to be a real party in your house when you're staring at this Blu-ray case,

01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:32.200
and that's on the PS3.

01:11:32.200 --> 01:11:33.540
What is it?

01:11:33.540 --> 01:11:35.900
How do you start the party?

01:11:35.900 --> 01:11:40.120
Start the party by buying the party supplies in preparation for two weeks.

01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:41.760
What is this fucking game, Loki?

01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:42.760
What are you doing?

01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:43.760
It is a cr- okay.

01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:44.760
You know Itoy Play?

01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:45.760
Okay.

01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:49.680
Let's do that, but now with the Playstation Move controller.

01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:51.000
It's Start the Party.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:52.000
Kung Fu Rider.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
Press start to party.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:58.640
Kung Fu Rider, a game so terrible it's actually probably more fun to stare at the case than

01:11:58.640 --> 01:12:00.200
actually play it.

01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:04.920
That'll be coming out as well on the Playstation 3 this week.

01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:05.920
Photo World.

01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:12.000
It's a game where you take photos with a DSI camera, and yes, it's a DSI-only game.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:13.000
That's awesome.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:16.480
That's stuff that I, I don't know, I could do without the game, with the game.

01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:20.560
That sounds more useful than Ping Pals on the DS.

01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:22.560
Yeah, almost.

01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:25.800
The Sims 3 Fast Lane stuff.

01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:27.380
I gotta read this in our chatroom.

01:12:27.380 --> 01:12:30.600
First off, I gotta catch up on some chat comments, because the chat's starting to fill up here.

01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:31.960
Thanks to you guys for tuning in early.

01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:32.960
We really appreciate it.

01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:34.720
There's quite a few of you here tonight, so thank you guys.

01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:35.720
Chat.orangestimesradio.com.

01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:40.640
Let's see, where was the, there was, oh yeah, I wanted to say this about Rose.

01:12:40.640 --> 01:12:44.480
Derek H., who brought up Cammy in the first place, actually says, I destroy people with

01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:45.480
Rose.

01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:46.480
Destroy.

01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:47.480
So there you go.

01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:49.080
Illusion spark, bitches.

01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:52.080
So it looks like you and Derek have a lot in common, because you're both Cammy and Rose

01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:53.080
players.

01:12:53.080 --> 01:12:54.080
Let's see.

01:12:54.080 --> 01:12:55.080
Where was I?

01:12:55.080 --> 01:12:57.120
Say, oh yeah, start the party.

01:12:57.120 --> 01:12:58.720
Redertainment says start the party.

01:12:58.720 --> 01:13:01.800
Gin, vodka, and hot women not included.

01:13:01.800 --> 01:13:02.800
Or fun.

01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:05.040
I do have, I do have vodka and tequila.

01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:06.040
Do you?

01:13:06.040 --> 01:13:07.040
Yes, do you want some?

01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:08.040
Yeah.

01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:09.040
We're gonna start the party right now.

01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:12.880
Seriously, I need you, I need everyone to drink up my booze.

01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:15.480
I'll have a little bit, but keep in mind, I gotta drive home when this is all over,

01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:16.480
so I'll get.

01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:17.480
You've got hours to get sober.

01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:20.800
I'll have a drink or two, well I could also run out and get dinner at some point, so I'll

01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:21.800
have like a beer.

01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:22.800
Do you have a Guinness?

01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:23.800
I want a Guinness.

01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:24.800
No, I don't have a Guinness.

01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:25.800
I have two New Castles left.

01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:27.360
Oh, New Castle, New Castle, New Castle, New Castle.

01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:28.360
Humor Games this week.

01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:29.360
You can have a New Castle.

01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:30.360
Yay, thank you.

01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:31.360
Oh, sorry.

01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:37.840
UFC Undisputed 2010 on PSP, Prison Tycoon, Alcatraz, once again delayed, thank you value

01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:40.560
soft for not being able to hit your damn street dates.

01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:46.640
Dawn of Heroes on DS, speaking of delayed games, that'll be coming out this week, maybe.

01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:53.560
King's Bounty Armored Princess, not sure what that is, but yeah, it's on PC.

01:13:53.560 --> 01:14:00.200
And finally, Professor Layton and the Unwound Future on Nintendo DS, that comes out one

01:14:00.200 --> 01:14:03.240
week from today.

01:14:03.240 --> 01:14:04.240
That is it.

01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:05.240
Alright.

01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:09.720
Let's move on, talk about Japanese release dates, looking at what's coming out in Japan.

01:14:09.720 --> 01:14:16.680
Starting off with the Xbox 360 on September 9th, UFC Undisputed 2010 is coming out on

01:14:16.680 --> 01:14:19.920
the Xbox 360, for those that are into that.

01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:25.880
Excuse me, I'm moving on to the PlayStation 3 and checking out what's coming out over

01:14:25.880 --> 01:14:26.880
there.

01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:28.480
If I can find it.

01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:29.480
There we go.

01:14:29.480 --> 01:14:33.240
Split Second gets its Japanese release this week on the PlayStation 3.

01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:35.880
Also UFC Undisputed 2010 gets a release there, too.

01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:40.040
By the way, next week, Front Mission Evolved, just so you know, that's on the 16th, but

01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:42.800
I wanted to get that out there because I know there's a lot of Front Mission fans.

01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:45.760
It's kind of a cultish type of game.

01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:50.920
Looking at the Wii and what's coming out on the Wii, we have Okami getting a price cut

01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:52.520
this week on the Wii.

01:14:52.520 --> 01:14:59.280
Biohazard 4 is also getting a price cut and the Biohazard Chronicles, that of course is

01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:03.120
Resident Evil, what they call that series over there is Biohazard.

01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:09.840
Looking at the handheld systems on the Nintendo DS, One Piece Gigant Battle from Bandai Namco

01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:11.600
is coming out on the DS this week.

01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:15.120
I have no idea what that game is all about, but I'm assuming it's going to be a giant

01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:16.360
battle.

01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:24.920
And then on the PSP, Sengoku Efuda Yugi Hototosigusu Tyran comes out this week from iRAM.

01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:28.160
I have no idea what this game is, I'm trying to look at this real quick.

01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:29.880
This sounds interesting.

01:15:29.880 --> 01:15:37.040
It is a board game, it's a port of a board game I guess that's popular in Japan.

01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:39.800
Although this is not one I have ever seen before, I don't think it's chess or anything

01:15:39.800 --> 01:15:40.800
like that.

01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:45.440
Looks like it's a card slash board fusion type of game, so that might be interesting.

01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:48.240
That's coming out on the PSP this next week.

01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:52.020
And then Vitamin X Evolution Plus is also coming out this week.

01:15:52.020 --> 01:15:54.200
That's what it's called.

01:15:54.200 --> 01:15:58.120
So there you go, kind of a slow week in Japan, but just like we are, they're ramping up for

01:15:58.120 --> 01:15:59.620
Christmas.

01:15:59.620 --> 01:16:03.300
Although of course Halo is thrown in there to kind of liven things up this month.

01:16:03.300 --> 01:16:05.040
They get Halo next week, just so you know.

01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:07.360
Dark Sakura, what's coming out in Europe?

01:16:07.360 --> 01:16:12.760
On the 6th we have Chime for PC, and then the 7th is Dragon Age Origins Witch Hunt and

01:16:12.760 --> 01:16:15.600
Mass Effect 2, Lair of the Shadow Broker.

01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:22.040
And on the 8th we have Amnesia, The Dark Descent, and Plants vs. Zombies, which is crack.

01:16:22.040 --> 01:16:29.240
And then on the 10th we have Ace Combat Joint Assault, Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, and

01:16:29.240 --> 01:16:37.200
Tom Clancy's Hawks 2, which, I don't know, I'm still kind of giddy about Birth by Sleep.

01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:39.240
But this Amnesia thing sounds kind of interesting.

01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:45.940
I was looking up a little bit about it too, that I think it would be interesting to see

01:16:45.940 --> 01:16:48.040
that one, but...

01:16:48.040 --> 01:16:49.040
Is that coming out?

01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:50.040
Amnesia?

01:16:50.040 --> 01:16:51.040
Amnesia.

01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:53.080
The Dark Descent.

01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:55.120
It's from Frictional Games.

01:16:55.120 --> 01:16:56.120
Nope.

01:16:56.120 --> 01:17:02.280
If it does it will be ported over by Zoo Games, because they love taking European releases

01:17:02.280 --> 01:17:04.320
and bringing them out over here, eventually.

01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:05.320
Eventually.

01:17:05.320 --> 01:17:10.080
After they delayed them for months and months and months and months and months and months

01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:11.480
and months and months and months.

01:17:11.480 --> 01:17:13.720
But Plants vs. Zombies, that game is kind of crack.

01:17:13.720 --> 01:17:14.720
I mean...

01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:19.680
I'm actually looking, see, I'm looking forward to downloading that on the iPod when it comes

01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:20.680
in.

01:17:20.680 --> 01:17:22.200
Supposed to get it next week, because they're not yet released.

01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:25.360
It's supposed to be out on DS in January.

01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:26.360
Yes.

01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:27.360
Yes.

01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:28.360
So...

01:17:28.360 --> 01:17:34.080
But, you know, me being kind of a noob to the whole app store and stuff, I'm very pleased

01:17:34.080 --> 01:17:35.880
that they're not that expensive.

01:17:35.880 --> 01:17:43.720
Except I was actually shopping for something to use as like a Garmin or, you know, some

01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:45.080
sort of GPS thing.

01:17:45.080 --> 01:17:50.720
To add GPS to the iPod Touch is ridiculously expensive.

01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:53.440
Like I believe it's a TomTom adapter.

01:17:53.440 --> 01:17:57.720
They have, it's $79.99 just for the GPS adapter.

01:17:57.720 --> 01:18:00.760
Then they want you to pay another $40 for the fucking app.

01:18:00.760 --> 01:18:04.760
To which I gave them the big middle finger and said, fuck you, I will just look up directions

01:18:04.760 --> 01:18:09.080
on Google Maps and I'm smart enough as a human being to figure out how to get there.

01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:14.000
I do not need you to tell me how to get there for $120, you know, almost $120.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:15.000
Yeah.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:19.800
I better be getting free blowjobs for $120 from that thing, you know.

01:18:19.800 --> 01:18:22.600
It's just, it's not worth it.

01:18:22.600 --> 01:18:29.120
And honestly, I mean, if you've got, you may as well just use Google Maps because seriously,

01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:32.080
it's kind of like irritating I think when you have the speaking GPS.

01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:33.080
Yeah.

01:18:33.080 --> 01:18:38.240
I am going to get though, I want to get one of these Virgin Mobile MiFi 2200s.

01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:42.680
Now I know that the MiFi 2200 is actually available through a bunch of different, like

01:18:42.680 --> 01:18:44.440
Verizon and Sprint and stuff like that.

01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:47.720
But they're way more expensive and you have to have a contract.

01:18:47.720 --> 01:18:50.180
So I'm cheap.

01:18:50.180 --> 01:18:56.180
And sometimes I don't want to pay my bills, so this is perfect.

01:18:56.180 --> 01:18:57.680
I heard about those devices.

01:18:57.680 --> 01:18:58.800
I kind of want to get one.

01:18:58.800 --> 01:18:59.800
I'm serious.

01:18:59.800 --> 01:19:01.800
I'm getting one for, we could do it for podcasting.

01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:03.360
You can connect with the five devices.

01:19:03.360 --> 01:19:05.680
We can do like podcasting anywhere.

01:19:05.680 --> 01:19:10.720
Plus, I'm just going to shove it in my pocket and I can use my iPod touch like, you know,

01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:11.720
like a phone basically.

01:19:11.720 --> 01:19:16.800
I would worry about podcasting over 3G though because we skip enough on this stream as it

01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:17.800
is.

01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:22.280
At least not, it's like an average DSL connection.

01:19:22.280 --> 01:19:26.040
It's not horrible as long as you're in a decent area.

01:19:26.040 --> 01:19:29.320
But I mean, I don't know.

01:19:29.320 --> 01:19:31.920
I wouldn't exactly use it for podcasting all the time.

01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:35.760
Maybe just surfing the web while I'm out there.

01:19:35.760 --> 01:19:40.520
I like the iPhone as far as surfing the web and stuff, but I don't want to pay the fees

01:19:40.520 --> 01:19:41.700
each month for it.

01:19:41.700 --> 01:19:46.480
And also, you know, I don't really need the phone stuff too much.

01:19:46.480 --> 01:19:50.240
I use maybe, if I'm lucky, 30 minutes a month.

01:19:50.240 --> 01:19:54.240
So all these cell phone plans are way too expensive for what they give me.

01:19:54.240 --> 01:19:58.120
Although I have been looking at, they've been advertising the new Virgin Mobile ones too

01:19:58.120 --> 01:20:00.280
for $25 a month for everything.

01:20:00.280 --> 01:20:02.400
I don't like the phones for that.

01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:03.400
That's the only bad thing.

01:20:03.400 --> 01:20:08.320
If it was like, you know, an iPhone for $25 a month, then I'd be all over that shit.

01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:14.900
Anyway, sorry, I'm not trying to sound like a peddler for Virgin Mobile.

01:20:14.900 --> 01:20:20.720
So let's talk about the PlayStation 3 and all sorts of weird stuff going on in the mod

01:20:20.720 --> 01:20:22.600
ship world there.

01:20:22.600 --> 01:20:29.800
You may remember the PlayStation Jailbreak was announced last week, and of course, you

01:20:29.800 --> 01:20:35.560
know, for a very expensive hundred and, I don't remember how much it was, $70 or something

01:20:35.560 --> 01:20:37.040
like that for it.

01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:42.080
Well, funny enough, you know, there was a temporary injunction placed on them last week

01:20:42.080 --> 01:20:44.960
where they were prevented from selling it until the 31st.

01:20:44.960 --> 01:20:50.520
Then the 31st rolled around, and they were delayed until Friday, and on Friday, Sony

01:20:50.520 --> 01:20:57.640
actually won the court case, so they had prevented them, OZ mod chips, and actually any of the

01:20:57.640 --> 01:21:03.560
mod chip manufacturers or resellers in Australia from selling the devices.

01:21:03.560 --> 01:21:10.900
And so they were, you know, basically prevented from selling everything, and they had been

01:21:10.900 --> 01:21:13.240
taking the court and all that stuff.

01:21:13.240 --> 01:21:17.120
So everyone that bought one had their money returned, which is awesome, because at the

01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:21.540
same time, you know, the people that may have been buying them from OZ mod chips or even

01:21:21.540 --> 01:21:28.820
in the U.S., now Sony is going after the U.S. manufacturers, or I should say resellers.

01:21:28.820 --> 01:21:39.400
They're going against Zumba LDC, whose website ShopsJailbreak.com has been selling a new

01:21:39.400 --> 01:21:46.680
PS3 Jailbreak mod chips for their very expensive price of like $100 and some dollars.

01:21:46.680 --> 01:21:48.060
So they're going after them now.

01:21:48.060 --> 01:21:53.280
But all of that doesn't really matter, because people have already cloned the PlayStation

01:21:53.280 --> 01:22:01.560
Jailbreak with a device called the PS Groove, and the PS Groove basically is an open source

01:22:01.560 --> 01:22:09.720
mod chip that runs off of a Teensy++ USB development board or an AT90 USB key.

01:22:09.720 --> 01:22:12.340
Both of those run under $30 some dollars.

01:22:12.340 --> 01:22:21.120
It's $24 for the one and about $31 for the other, which is a lot cheaper than, you know,

01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:23.000
$100 and some dollars.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:27.960
And what's great about that is, you know, the part that kind of pissed off Sony with

01:22:27.960 --> 01:22:32.120
the whole backup manager, they actually have disabled the backup manager, but then of course

01:22:32.120 --> 01:22:36.280
people have released modified versions that have the backup manager in there again.

01:22:36.280 --> 01:22:39.440
But it is a solution that is now widely available.

01:22:39.440 --> 01:22:47.360
So Sony, you know, by snipping this other one in the butt, kind of made themselves a

01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:48.860
bigger problem.

01:22:48.860 --> 01:22:55.640
And so now they're actually porting the PlayStation Groove to the PSP, which will run as an application

01:22:55.640 --> 01:23:00.000
on there on a Homebrew firmware.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:06.160
So you'll actually be able to use your PSP for free to mod your PlayStation 3 if you

01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:07.160
have that.

01:23:07.160 --> 01:23:12.480
Or if you can't wait for that to come out and you happen to have a Nokia N900, you can

01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:15.200
actually do that for free now.

01:23:15.200 --> 01:23:21.760
And you can connect that to your PlayStation 3 using the special port of the PlayStation

01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:27.040
Groove to crack your system, so that sucks.

01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:29.880
It's something that I don't know if they're going to be able to patch out.

01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:33.400
It's definitely, if you're using the backup manager, there's ways to tell that you're

01:23:33.400 --> 01:23:34.400
doing it.

01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:38.520
But they're working on ways now to basically make it stealth.

01:23:38.520 --> 01:23:43.740
They've taken the device ID, because each game has like an ID code to it, and so they

01:23:43.740 --> 01:23:46.080
can tell what game you're playing.

01:23:46.080 --> 01:23:49.960
Well, the stealth version of it, which isn't entirely stealth yet, because they haven't

01:23:49.960 --> 01:23:54.640
erased all the old ID code out of it, is making the game look like, or making it look like

01:23:54.640 --> 01:23:58.400
you're playing a copy of Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2, which a lot of people out there

01:23:58.400 --> 01:24:02.000
are, so it would be hard to track them down.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:03.960
But it's only going to get worse for them now.

01:24:03.960 --> 01:24:08.680
Because once you have this system out now to actually mod your system, people are going

01:24:08.680 --> 01:24:12.440
to find out ways to do custom firmwares, and it only goes from there.

01:24:12.440 --> 01:24:15.800
It's just going to snowball.

01:24:15.800 --> 01:24:17.760
Is there anything Sony can do about all this?

01:24:17.760 --> 01:24:19.040
I don't know if they can.

01:24:19.040 --> 01:24:26.240
I mean, other than maybe they can fix the hack, but apparently from what I was reading

01:24:26.240 --> 01:24:35.280
though, the way that this exploit is done is actually before the firmware, so to patch

01:24:35.280 --> 01:24:38.560
it with the firmware might be impossible.

01:24:38.560 --> 01:24:43.320
It's before the firmware actually kicks in, so it's impossible maybe to do that, but they

01:24:43.320 --> 01:24:48.840
may be able to block the ID for the backup manager or something like that, but they're

01:24:48.840 --> 01:24:53.360
just going to, if it's that easy to change the game ID on the backup manager, that won't

01:24:53.360 --> 01:24:57.280
really be an issue, because they can just keep changing it to keep dodging any blocks

01:24:57.280 --> 01:24:59.220
that they put in place.

01:24:59.220 --> 01:25:05.800
So it'll be interesting, and definitely they're going to be doing another update soon for

01:25:05.800 --> 01:25:10.640
either PlayStation Move stuff, I know they already have that Move stuff available right

01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:15.520
now, the firmware for that, but they're going to be doing the 3D Blu-ray stuff, and who

01:25:15.520 --> 01:25:18.720
knows what other patches later on.

01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:21.480
They're going to try to patch it, that's for sure, but I have a feeling it's going to go

01:25:21.480 --> 01:25:24.040
back and forth, just like the whole PSP stuff.

01:25:24.040 --> 01:25:27.320
But you won't be able to play online with this, right?

01:25:27.320 --> 01:25:29.560
They'll be able to get that, right?

01:25:29.560 --> 01:25:33.280
As of right now, see here's the thing with the online.

01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:37.920
See that's the issue with playing with the backup manager, because it shows that ID code,

01:25:37.920 --> 01:25:42.400
and they can go, okay, this person's playing online with this ID code, okay they're using

01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:45.760
the backup manager, bam, we bam their console.

01:25:45.760 --> 01:25:50.080
But they're changing it to mimic Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2, it'll look like, oh they're

01:25:50.080 --> 01:25:55.680
playing Modern Warfare 2, and then they're not going to ban them.

01:25:55.680 --> 01:26:01.440
So if they successfully masked the backup manager to make it look like Modern Warfare

01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:06.320
2, then there really is nothing they can do as far as detecting which console's running

01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:09.280
this backup manager.

01:26:09.280 --> 01:26:11.080
So it's going to be tough.

01:26:11.080 --> 01:26:14.200
Alright, well we'll see what develops.

01:26:14.200 --> 01:26:18.960
I'm kind of curious to see how Sony's long-term strategy of this plays out, because it's kind

01:26:18.960 --> 01:26:21.760
of like, yeah they can try and stop this with the court orders and everything, but once

01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:24.080
the technology's out there, it's out there, you know what I mean, it's going to be very

01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:26.500
hard to stop, especially when they're telling people how to make their own.

01:26:26.500 --> 01:26:34.480
And they're already starting to dump games too, so the whole scene now, because the hard

01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:39.000
drives, you don't even really have to do too much, you just can copy the files straight

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:44.320
to your hard drive, and people are just doing Blu-Ray dumps.

01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:48.080
Would Spaznator be able to use this to get his videos to work when Sony keeps screwing

01:26:48.080 --> 01:26:50.880
them over with the whole console and all that?

01:26:50.880 --> 01:26:51.880
I don't know.

01:26:51.880 --> 01:26:53.880
I mean, I don't know.

01:26:53.880 --> 01:26:58.560
Alright, let's see, Brakeman in our chat room says, so people hacked a Sony system, isn't

01:26:58.560 --> 01:26:59.960
that business as usual with Sony?

01:26:59.960 --> 01:27:00.960
Not for the PS3.

01:27:00.960 --> 01:27:02.560
Yeah, not for the PS3.

01:27:02.560 --> 01:27:07.720
I mean, they really kind of rolled this out as unhackable, and for a while it certainly

01:27:07.720 --> 01:27:11.740
seemed that way, although we all knew in the back of our heads somebody would hack it eventually,

01:27:11.740 --> 01:27:12.960
so it's finally coming around.

01:27:12.960 --> 01:27:16.440
But with the fact that Blu-Ray hasn't really been easily adopted into burning and all that

01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:22.720
yet, it's still got a ways to go, I think, before you're going to see mass market piracy

01:27:22.720 --> 01:27:23.720
for this.

01:27:23.720 --> 01:27:24.720
Yeah, I don't know.

01:27:24.720 --> 01:27:30.400
But they keep claiming piracy killed the PSP, but I don't know, I have mixed feelings on

01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:31.400
that.

01:27:31.400 --> 01:27:32.400
I don't think it's totally right.

01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:34.840
It's a good scapegoat, because they don't really, it's hard to tell what the numbers

01:27:34.840 --> 01:27:41.480
are actually on that, but I'm sure it contributed to it, but then again, look at the Nintendo

01:27:41.480 --> 01:27:42.480
DS.

01:27:42.480 --> 01:27:49.400
I mean, that system is doing really well, and I know piracy has affected that, but it's

01:27:49.400 --> 01:27:53.120
hard to say, and I don't know.

01:27:53.120 --> 01:27:59.720
It'll be interesting to see what happens, but I don't know, it'll just be fun to play

01:27:59.720 --> 01:28:01.840
around with, I think.

01:28:01.840 --> 01:28:02.840
All right.

01:28:02.840 --> 01:28:10.800
Well, let's move on to another story about the Xbox 360 this time, and some price changes

01:28:10.800 --> 01:28:12.200
going on in the 360.

01:28:12.200 --> 01:28:14.600
This was news that came out this week.

01:28:14.600 --> 01:28:21.800
A one month gold subscription to Xbox Live is going up, starting November 1st, $8 to

01:28:21.800 --> 01:28:22.800
$10.

01:28:22.800 --> 01:28:23.800
That's good.

01:28:23.800 --> 01:28:32.400
Three months going up from $20 to $25, and a full year of Xbox Live up $50 to $60.

01:28:32.400 --> 01:28:37.480
Of course, that's really $49.99 to $59, but it's $50 to $60.

01:28:37.480 --> 01:28:39.840
I'm throwing in that extra penny there.

01:28:39.840 --> 01:28:43.640
The price of Xbox Live has gone up, folks, but what's interesting about this story, it's

01:28:43.640 --> 01:28:46.960
the first time we've ever had this story in the history of our show, which has been going

01:28:46.960 --> 01:28:48.800
about as long as Xbox Live has.

01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:52.540
They haven't raised the price in the years that it's been active.

01:28:52.540 --> 01:28:54.520
Is it justified that they raise the price now?

01:28:54.520 --> 01:28:56.680
What do you guys think?

01:28:56.680 --> 01:28:59.240
I kind of thought it was about time.

01:28:59.240 --> 01:29:07.780
I mean, you've got to keep up with the market, and if you're not making enough to match cost

01:29:07.780 --> 01:29:13.160
and still have the right profit margin they're expecting, then I don't see why not.

01:29:13.160 --> 01:29:16.360
By the way, if you're worried about this price increase, there are some ways you can lock

01:29:16.360 --> 01:29:17.360
in the old price.

01:29:17.360 --> 01:29:23.720
You can do a renewal of one year through Xbox.com right now for $40, or you can also buy some

01:29:23.720 --> 01:29:28.300
of those prepaid cards right now with the lower prices, because you can still find those

01:29:28.300 --> 01:29:29.640
for the old prices.

01:29:29.640 --> 01:29:33.520
If you load up on a couple of those, then you'll be locked in for however much time.

01:29:33.520 --> 01:29:38.680
Dude, it's seriously like 80 some cents more a month.

01:29:38.680 --> 01:29:43.800
That's what it is, average out, and honestly, $10 more, yeah, that is more money for you

01:29:43.800 --> 01:29:49.380
to pay, but look at what the hell, download content and your Xbox Live arcade games cost

01:29:49.380 --> 01:29:50.380
that much.

01:29:50.380 --> 01:29:53.800
I understand that everybody's cash strapped nowadays with the economy and everything,

01:29:53.800 --> 01:29:55.800
but come on.

01:29:55.800 --> 01:30:00.600
Eat one less lunch out or something, I mean, stop fucking bitching about $10.

01:30:00.600 --> 01:30:04.720
It's not like the price is doubling, and I understand that you may not use all the features,

01:30:04.720 --> 01:30:08.840
because honestly, I don't use most of the features on Xbox Live.

01:30:08.840 --> 01:30:14.280
I don't use Twitter, I don't use Facebook, none of the extra stuff, and the ESPN's streaming

01:30:14.280 --> 01:30:18.320
and stuff like that, I could care less about it, and the fact that it's going up $10, it

01:30:18.320 --> 01:30:23.040
doesn't really bother me, because so what?

01:30:23.040 --> 01:30:27.720
Well speaking of ESPN, in our chat room, Blaze says, given that this ESPN functionality is

01:30:27.720 --> 01:30:31.080
supposed to be absurdly amazing, that it's not that big a deal.

01:30:31.080 --> 01:30:35.040
Breakman says, fuck you Microsoft, everyone kept asking them when Xbox Live will go free,

01:30:35.040 --> 01:30:38.200
so they said fuck you, we'll raise the price.

01:30:38.200 --> 01:30:42.920
I'm okay with this price hike, because they haven't done one in so long, and it does seem

01:30:42.920 --> 01:30:46.760
like, you know, the amount of content on Xbox Live, there's a lot of it there.

01:30:46.760 --> 01:30:51.880
I'm okay with it, you know, because we're talking on a yearly basis too.

01:30:51.880 --> 01:30:57.020
If this is where we're going instead of the online pass, I'm okay with it.

01:30:57.020 --> 01:30:59.540
But unfortunately, I think we all know it's not.

01:30:59.540 --> 01:31:05.120
That online pass still exists, and to me, you can't do this and that.

01:31:05.120 --> 01:31:06.120
You really shouldn't.

01:31:06.120 --> 01:31:10.400
This online pass is ridiculous in the first place, but it's even more so with this.

01:31:10.400 --> 01:31:15.360
I don't blame Microsoft for the online pass stuff, I blame the third party publishers.

01:31:15.360 --> 01:31:18.600
Microsoft could stop it.

01:31:18.600 --> 01:31:21.060
It's their servers, their stores, they could stop.

01:31:21.060 --> 01:31:22.060
It's their software though.

01:31:22.060 --> 01:31:27.160
If they want to prevent people from connecting online, they can do that.

01:31:27.160 --> 01:31:28.160
It's their software.

01:31:28.160 --> 01:31:32.120
I understand that they should step up and say, hey, you know, you shouldn't be doing

01:31:32.120 --> 01:31:36.020
that kind of stuff on our service, because they made a member of everybody play nice

01:31:36.020 --> 01:31:41.600
with the guitar controllers and stuff like that, they all had to work together.

01:31:41.600 --> 01:31:46.240
That was kind of cool, but I think that they should step up and do that, since they have

01:31:46.240 --> 01:31:51.600
dedicated servers for all this stuff, but once again, it's these third party companies

01:31:51.600 --> 01:31:54.360
getting greedy with forced up.

01:31:54.360 --> 01:31:59.440
It sets a really bad precedent though, when you have Sony doing the same thing.

01:31:59.440 --> 01:32:02.720
Like if Microsoft said, oh, by the way, we're going to charge you $10 to play this game

01:32:02.720 --> 01:32:06.960
online, or I'm sorry, yeah, Microsoft said, no, we're going to charge you $10 extra to

01:32:06.960 --> 01:32:10.820
play this game online if you buy it used, then there might be some issues, but I don't

01:32:10.820 --> 01:32:15.340
think they're going to go that route, because they're making enough money as it is on live

01:32:15.340 --> 01:32:22.400
and maybe they try supporting it with ad revenue and stuff like that, and maybe just the cost

01:32:22.400 --> 01:32:29.400
to run this stuff keeps going up and up, I mean, they keep adding features and stuff

01:32:29.400 --> 01:32:34.700
to it, and maybe it's just getting more expensive, I don't know.

01:32:34.700 --> 01:32:39.920
I really do feel the value of $50 for Xbox Live now is certainly better than it was eight

01:32:39.920 --> 01:32:40.920
years ago.

01:32:40.920 --> 01:32:41.920
Which is cool.

01:32:41.920 --> 01:32:45.880
I don't think that they would just say, okay, you know what, we want to make more money,

01:32:45.880 --> 01:32:46.880
so we're going to raise the price.

01:32:46.880 --> 01:32:50.880
I think that they would actually say, okay, listen, because they're going to try to keep

01:32:50.880 --> 01:32:57.320
it as low as possible to stay competitive with the PlayStation network, and I don't

01:32:57.320 --> 01:33:01.000
see them raising prices just because, oh, we need to make more money.

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:04.600
I think it's just that the cost of doing things is going up.

01:33:04.600 --> 01:33:10.760
Blaze said, remember that this online pass stuff applies to games that are multi console,

01:33:10.760 --> 01:33:16.400
and Microsoft requires online play to go through their servers, but Sony makes third party

01:33:16.400 --> 01:33:18.880
people run their own servers.

01:33:18.880 --> 01:33:25.040
Well okay, but still, then put the online pass on Sony, not Microsoft.

01:33:25.040 --> 01:33:27.480
Stop being lazy and just putting out the same code for both systems.

01:33:27.480 --> 01:33:31.960
If people are that pissed off about a $10 price hike, then you need to spend the extra

01:33:31.960 --> 01:33:38.280
effort it's going to take to go and find those cards for cheaper, and honestly, there are

01:33:38.280 --> 01:33:39.280
cards out there.

01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:43.400
There's a lot of ways to get cards for like 40 bucks now.

01:33:43.400 --> 01:33:44.880
Go stock up on some of those.

01:33:44.880 --> 01:33:51.160
If you're so concerned about you spend the extra 83 cents a month, seriously, go for

01:33:51.160 --> 01:33:56.960
a walk around your local strip malls and stuff like that.

01:33:56.960 --> 01:34:00.280
You could probably find 83 cents on the ground.

01:34:00.280 --> 01:34:01.960
It's not that fucking expensive.

01:34:01.960 --> 01:34:04.880
Seriously, go without a can of soda one week.

01:34:04.880 --> 01:34:08.120
83 cents a month, let's break that down by week.

01:34:08.120 --> 01:34:14.480
That's like 20 cents a week, come on, find a dime.

01:34:14.480 --> 01:34:18.760
I understand that it's not that much money, but here you go, you're the devil's advocate.

01:34:18.760 --> 01:34:20.560
It's the principle.

01:34:20.560 --> 01:34:25.240
They're raising the price, and what are they doing to justify the raising of the price?

01:34:25.240 --> 01:34:29.780
Well people aren't too worried about paying $60 for games.

01:34:29.780 --> 01:34:35.280
That's a $10 price hike per game, so why aren't you just still playing your original PlayStation

01:34:35.280 --> 01:34:36.680
2 and Xbox then?

01:34:36.680 --> 01:34:41.560
Why aren't you boycotting all these different game systems since it's so expensive for you

01:34:41.560 --> 01:34:43.240
to spend the extra $10?

01:34:43.240 --> 01:34:46.920
I think you're a fucking hypocrite is what I think you are.

01:34:46.920 --> 01:34:51.040
Break Man in our chat room says, I'll pay Microsoft an extra $10 a month to take Facebook

01:34:51.040 --> 01:34:52.920
off my 360.

01:34:52.920 --> 01:34:53.920
Amen to that.

01:34:53.920 --> 01:34:55.640
Facebook on 360 is ugly.

01:34:55.640 --> 01:34:59.320
It looks better on a cell phone, and that is saying a lot.

01:34:59.320 --> 01:35:03.540
Anyhow, let's move on and get into the classic video game of the week.

01:35:03.540 --> 01:35:08.280
It's a chance for us to take a trip down memory lane, where Dark Sakura will dig into the

01:35:08.280 --> 01:35:14.380
gamer vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, you kids out there in internet land.

01:35:14.380 --> 01:35:15.920
Get off my lawn and play this game.

01:35:15.920 --> 01:35:18.880
Get off my lawn and go inside and play this game.

01:35:18.880 --> 01:35:22.600
Dark Sakura, what is the classic game of the week?

01:35:22.600 --> 01:35:24.600
X-Men for the Sega Genesis.

01:35:24.600 --> 01:35:26.600
This game is cool.

01:35:26.600 --> 01:35:33.360
I have to save something for the future, Rob.

01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:36.180
Probably I think one of the best games that came on the Genesis.

01:35:36.180 --> 01:35:45.760
It was in 1993, and it was the whole 90s era of X-Men.

01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:50.840
The game basically starts off, we're in the danger room, and there's a virus that goes

01:35:50.840 --> 01:35:52.040
into the danger rooms.

01:35:52.040 --> 01:35:56.880
You have to go through different areas within the danger room, and then fight Magneto at

01:35:56.880 --> 01:35:57.880
the end.

01:35:57.880 --> 01:36:07.320
So you play as Gambit, or Nightcrawler, Wolverine, or Cyclops, and they have different, you know,

01:36:07.320 --> 01:36:11.480
regular punches, kicks, whatever, and then they have their mutant power that has a dumb

01:36:11.480 --> 01:36:16.720
power bar, and then they have the rest of their life bar.

01:36:16.720 --> 01:36:22.040
Your bar will regenerate, and you can also switch characters in mid-level, so that helps

01:36:22.040 --> 01:36:24.680
you save stuff off.

01:36:24.680 --> 01:36:32.080
So yeah, with Wolverine, he basically has his big bad claws and his healing factor.

01:36:32.080 --> 01:36:38.160
Gambit has his charged cards for a special attack, Cyclops has the optic blast, and Nightcrawler

01:36:38.160 --> 01:36:41.200
has the ability to teleport, which is useful.

01:36:41.200 --> 01:36:43.600
He was actually my favorite character to use in the game.

01:36:43.600 --> 01:36:51.860
You also get Storm, Rogue, Iceman, and Archangel as sort of helpers.

01:36:51.860 --> 01:36:56.320
You can call on them for help, and you can also get Jean Grey to pop up if you happen

01:36:56.320 --> 01:36:59.960
to fall, and you fight different X-Men villains, so it's pretty cool.

01:36:59.960 --> 01:37:03.480
But one of the cool things about this game, and it had a...

01:37:03.480 --> 01:37:09.320
It broke the fourth wall.

01:37:09.320 --> 01:37:13.860
When you defeat Mojo, you have to reset the computer in the danger room, but what it really

01:37:13.860 --> 01:37:18.520
means is reset your machine, and the whole trick is you just sort of have to pop the

01:37:18.520 --> 01:37:24.360
reset button, and then it'll black out and pop up these numbers like a computer rebooting,

01:37:24.360 --> 01:37:25.760
you know, in the 90s.

01:37:25.760 --> 01:37:29.280
So what, somebody's 486, I guess?

01:37:29.280 --> 01:37:34.560
Anyway, um, but we had a giggle from Loki about something.

01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:37.040
Sorry, something someone posted.

01:37:37.040 --> 01:37:38.040
Uh...

01:37:38.040 --> 01:37:40.040
I'm curious now.

01:37:40.040 --> 01:37:41.720
Uh, take a right.

01:37:41.720 --> 01:37:44.840
Can wait until after the classic game.

01:37:44.840 --> 01:37:49.520
Um, one thing that I need to point out is that if you hit the button too hard, of course,

01:37:49.520 --> 01:37:52.320
it will reset the game, and you're like SOL.

01:37:52.320 --> 01:37:59.080
Or if you have a nomad, the nomad doesn't have a reset button, so you're SOL there unless

01:37:59.080 --> 01:38:00.680
you level skip.

01:38:00.680 --> 01:38:07.020
Um, all of the music in the game was done by Fletcher Beasley, who used the Genesis

01:38:07.020 --> 01:38:14.960
emulation music software, and it would work with the Yamaha 2612 FM synthesizer chip on

01:38:14.960 --> 01:38:18.680
the Genesis, so you could play the sounds back through it and you know what it sounds

01:38:18.680 --> 01:38:19.680
like.

01:38:19.680 --> 01:38:20.680
So it's actually got a really cool soundtrack.

01:38:20.680 --> 01:38:23.120
I think that it sounds really good.

01:38:23.120 --> 01:38:29.400
Um, but he's quoted as saying that he was trying to use the sound of the distorted guitar

01:38:29.400 --> 01:38:32.800
in his tracks to make them sound edgier.

01:38:32.800 --> 01:38:35.600
And, I mean, it's got a great soundtrack.

01:38:35.600 --> 01:38:36.600
Kudos to him.

01:38:36.600 --> 01:38:38.240
But it was a really cool game.

01:38:38.240 --> 01:38:42.360
It actually, there's one level in that game that pissed me off to no end, and it was always,

01:38:42.360 --> 01:38:44.480
um, the Mojo World level.

01:38:44.480 --> 01:38:46.480
Hated it.

01:38:46.480 --> 01:38:49.880
I'm dead.

01:38:49.880 --> 01:38:50.880
That's fighting Mojo.

01:38:50.880 --> 01:38:51.880
Mojo Jojo.

01:38:51.880 --> 01:38:52.880
Just kidding.

01:38:52.880 --> 01:39:01.080
Alright, there you go, your classic game of the week is X-Man on the Genesis.

01:39:01.080 --> 01:39:02.080
Good times.

01:39:02.080 --> 01:39:05.240
Thank you very much, Dark Soccer.

01:39:05.240 --> 01:39:09.760
Good pick, even if I'm more of a fan of the arcade one, but that's okay.

01:39:09.760 --> 01:39:12.040
Okay, Loki, why are you giggling?

01:39:12.040 --> 01:39:13.040
Oh, nothing.

01:39:13.040 --> 01:39:17.760
There was someone was pointing out, actually one of our listeners, they were pointing out

01:39:17.760 --> 01:39:22.040
that, you know, have you heard that, you know, have you seen the story about Earth Defense

01:39:22.040 --> 01:39:25.240
Force, a new Earth Defense Force game coming out next year?

01:39:25.240 --> 01:39:31.220
And I actually clicked on the link to check it out, and then it links the Structoid article

01:39:31.220 --> 01:39:36.920
that links also a CheapAssGamer article, where I'm the source of that news information.

01:39:36.920 --> 01:39:37.920
Nice.

01:39:37.920 --> 01:39:40.440
It's like, yeah, I heard about it.

01:39:40.440 --> 01:39:44.380
Actually, I'm looking at this, this was just, what's today, the fifth?

01:39:44.380 --> 01:39:46.320
This was like four hours ago.

01:39:46.320 --> 01:39:51.520
Yeah, the GameStop conference, I think they had an actual logo for it, and if you go to

01:39:51.520 --> 01:39:58.040
uh, uh, EDFIA.com, you can check out, they have the placeholder logo for it, Earth Defense

01:39:58.040 --> 01:39:59.040
Force, Insect Armageddon.

01:39:59.040 --> 01:40:03.760
Actually, you gotta hear this, this is pretty good, and shout out to this guy, because he

01:40:03.760 --> 01:40:07.900
must be a listener to the show, but this is on examiner.com, I guess?

01:40:07.900 --> 01:40:11.800
Is that the Chicago Cons, I don't know.

01:40:11.800 --> 01:40:15.480
Orange Launch Radio podcast co-host, Loki, has recently uncovered a sequel to the B-movie

01:40:15.480 --> 01:40:18.000
quality Earth Defense Force 2017.

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:21.380
If this news is correct, then all is well with the world, the game falls under the same

01:40:21.380 --> 01:40:23.520
category as Deadly Premonition for me.

01:40:23.520 --> 01:40:27.520
According to his information, Earth Defense Force 2017, Insect Armageddon for the Xbox

01:40:27.520 --> 01:40:30.960
360, is being released sometime in February 2011 by D3 publisher.

01:40:30.960 --> 01:40:34.320
Loki, who works for a game distributor and has a strong track record on things such as

01:40:34.320 --> 01:40:38.920
unannounced games, tweeted the following, just saw this on my release list from D3,

01:40:38.920 --> 01:40:42.640
Earth Defense Force 2017, Insect Armageddon, coming February on Xbox 360.

01:40:42.640 --> 01:40:45.120
Dude, wasn't that like a month ago that you tweeted that?

01:40:45.120 --> 01:40:46.120
What's a month ago?

01:40:46.120 --> 01:40:48.440
This ran four hours ago on this website.

01:40:48.440 --> 01:40:51.440
As someone who has invested a crazy amount of time in Earth Defense Force, I accept this

01:40:51.440 --> 01:40:52.440
story.

01:40:52.440 --> 01:40:54.920
That's just a repost of the Cheap Ass Gamer one, I think.

01:40:54.920 --> 01:40:55.920
Is it?

01:40:55.920 --> 01:40:56.920
That's Blue Swim.

01:40:56.920 --> 01:40:57.920
Whatever.

01:40:57.920 --> 01:40:58.920
But anyway.

01:40:58.920 --> 01:40:59.920
That's funny to me.

01:40:59.920 --> 01:41:00.920
It is funny.

01:41:00.920 --> 01:41:01.920
I hope you're right.

01:41:01.920 --> 01:41:04.520
We haven't heard anything more about it, have we?

01:41:04.520 --> 01:41:05.520
I am right.

01:41:05.520 --> 01:41:06.520
It's on their release list.

01:41:06.520 --> 01:41:12.840
But I don't want anybody saying that I said that, I mean, I don't want D3 being pissed

01:41:12.840 --> 01:41:16.720
off at me, because then that comes back to me, and then I lose my job.

01:41:16.720 --> 01:41:19.840
That's why you gotta stop putting on Twitter, you have to do it here on the show in Secret

01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:21.560
Club, where these people don't listen.

01:41:21.560 --> 01:41:23.360
Well, people just need to stop realizing that.

01:41:23.360 --> 01:41:26.160
I'm a crazy person that says these things, okay?

01:41:26.160 --> 01:41:35.520
Yeah, it's just meant for sharing with the listeners, not to be as posted as a story.

01:41:35.520 --> 01:41:40.720
It's so when, you know, Joystiq picks this article up, you know, say four months from

01:41:40.720 --> 01:41:44.440
now, and they're like, hey, we just discovered that, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and then

01:41:44.440 --> 01:41:48.840
be like, hey, I knew about that months ago, good job.

01:41:48.840 --> 01:41:52.880
You know, it's just so you can realize that we knew it first.

01:41:52.880 --> 01:41:56.760
But you've also, they better not be mad at you, because you know what, you've been supporting

01:41:56.760 --> 01:41:57.760
this game from the beginning.

01:41:57.760 --> 01:41:58.920
It is so awesome!

01:41:58.920 --> 01:41:59.920
I am so excited!

01:41:59.920 --> 01:42:01.840
You probably know how this will happen, honestly.

01:42:01.840 --> 01:42:03.480
I don't know anyone who talks about this on you.

01:42:03.480 --> 01:42:07.080
I own four copies of this game, okay?

01:42:07.080 --> 01:42:08.540
And you know why I did that?

01:42:08.540 --> 01:42:11.160
Just in case ever one of my discs breaks.

01:42:11.160 --> 01:42:14.720
Which one of them has, because I played it so much.

01:42:14.720 --> 01:42:17.880
So I had three backup copies that I bought, you know, we were clearing them out of our

01:42:17.880 --> 01:42:21.800
warehouse for five bucks each, I'm like, I'm taking all of those!

01:42:21.800 --> 01:42:29.000
So yeah, I love this game, and I fully support the sequel, and I hope to God it has four-player

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:30.000
co-op.

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:31.000
Can I borrow one?

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.920
I actually looked for the game, I never was able to find it.

01:42:33.920 --> 01:42:34.920
Oh, sure.

01:42:34.920 --> 01:42:35.920
All right.

01:42:35.920 --> 01:42:37.240
But yeah, lesson learned here.

01:42:37.240 --> 01:42:39.600
Stop posting low-key stuff!

01:42:39.600 --> 01:42:45.160
No, I don't care, it doesn't, I don't, it's, I mean, they would have said something by

01:42:45.160 --> 01:42:46.160
now.

01:42:46.160 --> 01:42:47.160
Yeah, it's true.

01:42:47.160 --> 01:42:48.400
It was out there a month ago.

01:42:48.400 --> 01:42:50.560
And honestly, I mean, it's...

01:42:50.560 --> 01:42:51.920
The official logo showed up now, right?

01:42:51.920 --> 01:42:55.720
The official, they have the official websites up, and the GameStop conference, someone took

01:42:55.720 --> 01:42:58.080
a picture that says, Earth Defense Force returns 2011.

01:42:58.080 --> 01:42:59.080
So there you go.

01:42:59.080 --> 01:43:00.080
They have a banner for it.

01:43:00.080 --> 01:43:01.080
It's happening.

01:43:01.080 --> 01:43:03.720
So you were, but that went to, okay, so the story that went up four hours ago then is

01:43:03.720 --> 01:43:07.520
like behind, because this has already been confirmed, it's no longer a rumor.

01:43:07.520 --> 01:43:12.860
Yeah, well, Destructoid, they ran their story 16 hours ago, apparently, and they just picked

01:43:12.860 --> 01:43:17.680
up on, uh, uh, Neo Games Are Fun, I guess.

01:43:17.680 --> 01:43:25.640
They ran their, this, uh, was posted yesterday, so, I don't know, people are just figuring

01:43:25.640 --> 01:43:26.640
it out now.

01:43:26.640 --> 01:43:32.120
Does, see, that's why you gotta read myself closely, because, I don't know, I like...

01:43:32.120 --> 01:43:37.000
Well, Destructoid called D3 to get confirmation, so maybe you'll be in the office on Tuesday

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:38.000
and you're...

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:39.000
Who told you that?

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:40.000
Uh, uh, um...

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.480
CheapAss, well, they say, they reference CheapAssGamer.

01:43:42.480 --> 01:43:49.080
But they also have Neo, but they also have, uh, NeoGAF, though, like, right above that

01:43:49.080 --> 01:43:50.080
link, if you noticed.

01:43:50.080 --> 01:43:55.120
Wait, you know what, that's kind of fucked up, though, because it really wasn't CheapAssGamer.

01:43:55.120 --> 01:44:01.600
It's somebody on a blog on CheapAssGamer who starts off by referencing you.

01:44:01.600 --> 01:44:05.560
You know, and that, that's, that really was not CheapAssGamer doing that at all.

01:44:05.560 --> 01:44:06.640
It had nothing to do with that.

01:44:06.640 --> 01:44:08.080
It was that user.

01:44:08.080 --> 01:44:10.840
So either that user or you should have been credited.

01:44:10.840 --> 01:44:13.120
I mean, I'm not to, I'm just saying.

01:44:13.120 --> 01:44:14.120
A little bit, a little bit.

01:44:14.120 --> 01:44:18.520
I don't really care that I'm not credited, and it was, it's, uh, Blue Swim, which I believe

01:44:18.520 --> 01:44:19.520
is one of our listeners.

01:44:19.520 --> 01:44:20.520
Yeah, I've heard that name before.

01:44:20.520 --> 01:44:21.520
It's one of our listeners.

01:44:21.520 --> 01:44:22.520
Uh, yeah, so...

01:44:22.520 --> 01:44:25.840
And it's, I get it, that website does little personal blog things, and he's excited about

01:44:25.840 --> 01:44:26.840
this game like you are.

01:44:26.840 --> 01:44:29.640
And then, as, as he should be, it's an exciting game.

01:44:29.640 --> 01:44:32.520
But yeah, I understand that, because they wanna run that, because, you know, they run

01:44:32.520 --> 01:44:33.520
that kind of crap.

01:44:33.520 --> 01:44:36.840
And now they have more proof other than me saying it, because, you know, while I have

01:44:36.840 --> 01:44:40.960
a strong track record, I can't be trusted, because that's apparently why they didn't

01:44:40.960 --> 01:44:41.960
run the story in the first place.

01:44:41.960 --> 01:44:42.960
I see.

01:44:42.960 --> 01:44:43.960
I see.

01:44:43.960 --> 01:44:46.120
Because they need some physical proof, because I could just be spoutin' off crap.

01:44:46.120 --> 01:44:49.560
Because, you know, that's what I do all the time.

01:44:49.560 --> 01:44:50.560
I don't know.

01:44:50.560 --> 01:44:51.560
It's, it's stupid.

01:44:51.560 --> 01:44:52.560
Alright.

01:44:52.560 --> 01:44:53.560
We're over it.

01:44:53.560 --> 01:44:54.560
Let's get poses.

01:44:54.560 --> 01:44:55.560
I'm over it.

01:44:55.560 --> 01:44:56.560
Yeah, let's get poses.

01:44:56.560 --> 01:44:57.560
Kind of, just kind of funny.

01:44:57.560 --> 01:44:58.560
I am gonna beg them, though, for a copy of that game.

01:44:58.560 --> 01:45:00.560
I'm like, you need to send that to me now!

01:45:00.560 --> 01:45:02.600
Alright, we're gonna take a break.

01:45:02.600 --> 01:45:04.400
We'll be right back with more of Orange Launch Radio.

01:45:04.400 --> 01:45:06.080
Uh, tonight's the marathon, folks.

01:45:06.080 --> 01:45:10.640
We're, uh, about almost two hours in already, and we've got plenty more show to come.

01:45:10.640 --> 01:45:12.360
Uh, we still have the main show.

01:45:12.360 --> 01:45:16.600
We are gonna do Twitter topics, rapid-fire stories, uh, some news about the iPod Touch

01:45:16.600 --> 01:45:21.360
you're gonna get into, uh, some iPod-related news, um, Xbox Live Arcade, price drop for

01:45:21.360 --> 01:45:26.160
the DSI, the mailbags, the FUs, all that good stuff when we come back with more of Orange

01:45:26.160 --> 01:45:27.960
Lounge Radio.

01:45:27.960 --> 01:45:29.640
And we are gonna be taking a music break here.

01:45:29.640 --> 01:45:32.280
Um, I'm gonna be editing the podcast a little differently.

01:45:32.280 --> 01:45:35.440
It's just gonna kind of jump-skip into the next segment, so I apologize for the sloppy

01:45:35.440 --> 01:45:37.720
editing, but we can't play the copyrighted music on the podcast.

01:45:37.720 --> 01:45:41.120
Uh, we are gonna take a quick break, though, here in studio.

01:45:41.120 --> 01:45:43.360
Um, we'll do some music.

01:45:43.360 --> 01:45:48.360
By the way, today's break music is, like, all music that we used to play on, uh, OLR

01:45:48.360 --> 01:45:53.360
during, uh, when we were an actual station back in, what, like, 02, 03, so.

01:45:53.360 --> 01:45:55.160
We're, cause we're awesome that way.

01:45:55.160 --> 01:45:56.160
Yes.

01:45:56.160 --> 01:45:57.840
So we'll be right back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:45:57.840 --> 01:45:58.840
Don't go anywhere.

01:45:58.840 --> 01:45:59.840
About five minutes.

01:45:59.840 --> 01:46:00.840
Marathon continues.

01:46:00.840 --> 01:46:08.120
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:46:08.120 --> 01:46:12.720
We are live on this Saturday, or, sorry, Sunday, September the 5th of 2010.

01:46:12.720 --> 01:46:13.840
It's our marathon episode.

01:46:13.840 --> 01:46:15.640
We're still in kind of the main part of the show.

01:46:15.640 --> 01:46:18.840
Uh, there's been a lot of people asking if this marathon is gonna be podcast.

01:46:18.840 --> 01:46:19.840
Yes.

01:46:19.840 --> 01:46:20.840
We're gonna podcast it.

01:46:20.840 --> 01:46:23.800
Um, it'll go up on the feed in kind of different chunks throughout the week.

01:46:23.800 --> 01:46:28.000
Uh, but we wanna have, like, a main, you know, first off, I don't know how people are gonna

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:31.080
listen to, like, 12 hours of marathon throughout the week, but I suppose we have a lot of people

01:46:31.080 --> 01:46:35.240
at work and so forth that listen to a lot of podcasts while they do, you know, whatever

01:46:35.240 --> 01:46:36.680
desk job they might have.

01:46:36.680 --> 01:46:39.280
Um, so, you know, we'll put it out for those guys.

01:46:39.280 --> 01:46:43.640
But, um, for those that only want, like, the three hour OLR that they're used to, we're

01:46:43.640 --> 01:46:47.000
kind of taping our usual show for you of all the segments we usually do, and we'll save

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.120
some of the special stuff for a little later.

01:46:49.120 --> 01:46:52.160
So anyhow, um, let's get back into the marathon.

01:46:52.160 --> 01:46:53.480
It's just about four o'clock.

01:46:53.480 --> 01:46:54.480
We started at about two.

01:46:54.480 --> 01:46:56.920
Uh, we're gonna get back into some more, um, news.

01:46:56.920 --> 01:47:00.960
We're gonna do some rapid fire news, as we always do about this time in the show.

01:47:00.960 --> 01:47:03.860
Twitter topics coming up, and I haven't seen a lot come through on Twitter.

01:47:03.860 --> 01:47:07.520
Maybe I, I didn't ask earlier enough for stuff, but we'll see.

01:47:07.520 --> 01:47:10.760
So Twitter topics, uh, if you're hearing my voice, you wanna get some Twitter topics in,

01:47:10.760 --> 01:47:11.760
send those in.

01:47:11.760 --> 01:47:14.320
Meanwhile, Loki, what do you got for us?

01:47:14.320 --> 01:47:17.680
Oh, try to ref- hey, on Twitter topics, guys, try to refrain from just linking us to news

01:47:17.680 --> 01:47:21.360
stories, because we have a lot coming up later in the marathon, too.

01:47:21.360 --> 01:47:25.040
Um, you know, not that we don't appreciate that, but, uh, we probably are covering it

01:47:25.040 --> 01:47:26.040
at some point.

01:47:26.040 --> 01:47:27.040
Yeah.

01:47:27.040 --> 01:47:30.960
But if you have good questions or, or feedback on an earlier story or something, that's definitely

01:47:30.960 --> 01:47:31.960
what we're looking for tonight.

01:47:31.960 --> 01:47:34.520
All right, so let's get into some rapid fire news.

01:47:34.520 --> 01:47:35.520
Loki.

01:47:35.520 --> 01:47:41.040
Uh, there was an Easter egg discovered from, uh, Wave Race, Blue Storm, uh, yes, that old

01:47:41.040 --> 01:47:42.040
game.

01:47:42.040 --> 01:47:46.040
Um, they actually just found a, uh, what was it?

01:47:46.040 --> 01:47:51.920
It's an Easter egg that kinda changes some of the announcer audio, um, in the game.

01:47:51.920 --> 01:47:56.360
He starts B-rating you, and then also, for some reason, when you do your boost, it goes

01:47:56.360 --> 01:48:02.520
meow-meow, which is, I'm sure Irene would get a kick out of that.

01:48:02.520 --> 01:48:07.600
But, uh, yeah, it's, um, it's interesting, though, and apparently it's just, uh, a key

01:48:07.600 --> 01:48:14.000
press that you do in one of the options screens, um, but yeah, it's funny that games, even

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:18.200
though they're out, you know, that long, that some Easter eggs are just, you know, haven't

01:48:18.200 --> 01:48:19.200
been discovered yet.

01:48:19.200 --> 01:48:23.960
I remember there was one that was a couple weeks ago about, um, it was a Splinter Cell

01:48:23.960 --> 01:48:28.680
game, and they actually had it where, uh, there was a mission, a secret mission where

01:48:28.680 --> 01:48:35.800
you had to recover, um, or had to find all these, uh, space seals that were hidden in

01:48:35.800 --> 01:48:36.800
the game.

01:48:36.800 --> 01:48:41.080
It was a special, uh, save the seals mission, which is kinda weird.

01:48:41.080 --> 01:48:48.520
Um, there is a, uh, a game from Activision called Blood Drive that's, uh, I guess the

01:48:48.520 --> 01:48:56.080
information has been leaked out from the BBFC, um, I also saw it on their list, um, and it

01:48:56.080 --> 01:48:58.560
is gonna be a combat racing game.

01:48:58.560 --> 01:49:05.080
They, uh, guess, uh, the marketing shill, as they, uh, put it, is, uh, it's Shaun of

01:49:05.080 --> 01:49:08.200
the Dead meets Mad Max in Death Race.

01:49:08.200 --> 01:49:11.200
So basically a game that's cheesy and very gory.

01:49:11.200 --> 01:49:12.440
That sounds like fun.

01:49:12.440 --> 01:49:13.840
Yeah, it sounds awesome.

01:49:13.840 --> 01:49:20.560
And, uh, it is somewhat budget priced, it's $50 retail, and, uh, it'll be coming out in

01:49:20.560 --> 01:49:21.560
November.

01:49:21.560 --> 01:49:24.160
So, uh, that'd be cool.

01:49:24.160 --> 01:49:26.460
I'm, I'm down for combat racing games.

01:49:26.460 --> 01:49:29.600
And cheesy is good, as long as it's a good game.

01:49:29.600 --> 01:49:33.880
You know, not necessarily a terrible driving game.

01:49:33.880 --> 01:49:38.880
I don't know what universe $50 is a budget game, but I get it, I get it's $10 cheaper,

01:49:38.880 --> 01:49:39.880
but, yeah.

01:49:39.880 --> 01:49:40.880
Slightly cheaper.

01:49:40.880 --> 01:49:41.880
Hey, there you go!

01:49:41.880 --> 01:49:45.200
It's a combat game instead of a normal 360 game, you've saved your $10 that you can spend

01:49:45.200 --> 01:49:46.200
on live.

01:49:46.200 --> 01:49:49.520
Uh, dance, it's your stage.

01:49:49.520 --> 01:49:54.520
Coming out on Xbox Live Arcade September 8th, as I like to reiterate, it was a terrible

01:49:54.520 --> 01:49:55.520
game!

01:49:55.520 --> 01:50:01.080
But anyways, in case you're still curious about it, it is, um, a port of a German Wii

01:50:01.080 --> 01:50:09.600
game developed by Sproing, and, uh, I guess you, uh, you'll practice 20 unique choreographies

01:50:09.600 --> 01:50:15.120
and dance your way from the street stage all the way to the TV studio, under the watchful

01:50:15.120 --> 01:50:21.120
eye of, uh, Detlef, Detlef D. Seust?

01:50:21.120 --> 01:50:22.120
Some douche!

01:50:22.120 --> 01:50:29.380
Who, who is basically, uh, some German dancer, choreographer, um...

01:50:29.380 --> 01:50:31.280
Like I said.

01:50:31.280 --> 01:50:36.800
Honestly, uh, like I said before, it's a terrible game.

01:50:36.800 --> 01:50:42.480
It's just, it doesn't play very well, and, um, you know, if you look at the screenshots

01:50:42.480 --> 01:50:50.120
that they have of it, it's got this really weird, um, not like a note highway or something,

01:50:50.120 --> 01:50:54.420
but it's, it's sort of like DDR where they've got, you know, arrows coming down the screen,

01:50:54.420 --> 01:50:59.480
but it's two different rows of arrows, see, as you can see right here, and, um, you have

01:50:59.480 --> 01:51:04.360
to kind of move them in different, move your controllers in different directions to match

01:51:04.360 --> 01:51:10.760
that, the different analog sticks, and while that might be cool and stuff to do on, like,

01:51:10.760 --> 01:51:15.680
say, you know, a dance pad or something, it's really awkward on the controller, especially

01:51:15.680 --> 01:51:20.960
since, you know, one side doesn't correspond to certain directions, it's just mixed all

01:51:20.960 --> 01:51:26.880
over the place, and, uh, the music's terrible, so don't buy it.

01:51:26.880 --> 01:51:27.880
Nice.

01:51:27.880 --> 01:51:28.880
Instead, you need to buy some other games.

01:51:28.880 --> 01:51:33.360
Um, I think, uh, Plants vs. Zombies might be this week, so, you know, check that out.

01:51:33.360 --> 01:51:40.640
Uh, then of course, uh, the new iPod Touch with iOS 4, the, uh, retina display and, uh,

01:51:40.640 --> 01:51:46.160
game center has been, uh, revealed at the new, uh, Apple event that was this week, uh,

01:51:46.160 --> 01:51:53.440
is available in the 8 gigabyte model for $229, 32 gigs for $299, and a 64 gig model for $399.

01:51:53.440 --> 01:51:57.480
It is coming out next week, and it basically has all the wonderful features of the new

01:51:57.480 --> 01:52:07.160
iPhone 4, except, of course, no GPS, um, no phone, and, uh, much, much cheaper, I think,

01:52:07.160 --> 01:52:09.720
but, um, yeah, we will be picking one of those up myself.

01:52:09.720 --> 01:52:13.640
Also, uh, some of the other stuff that they, um, announced at the event, of course, the

01:52:13.640 --> 01:52:20.220
new Apple TV for $99, um, which is kind of cool, I guess, if you're into that.

01:52:20.220 --> 01:52:24.120
And then, um, something else that was kind of cool, one of the things that they're really

01:52:24.120 --> 01:52:29.760
kind of pushing that, you know, the iPhone and iPod is like a gaming platform, Project

01:52:29.760 --> 01:52:35.400
Sword, which is a game that's running on the Unreal 3 engine, and, um, is coming out from

01:52:35.400 --> 01:52:41.600
Epic, and actually looks pretty good, so it is a sword fighting game that is, uh, focused

01:52:41.600 --> 01:52:47.600
on one-on-one battles, so kind of like, uh, oh, there's a, some Wii game that came out

01:52:47.600 --> 01:52:51.920
that's kind of similar to that, hopefully not like the Castlevania fighting game, but,

01:52:51.920 --> 01:52:56.880
uh, looks pretty good, and it's kind of amazing to see that they ported the Unreal 3 engine

01:52:56.880 --> 01:53:00.760
to, you know, iOS, so neat.

01:53:00.760 --> 01:53:01.760
Neat.

01:53:01.760 --> 01:53:07.040
Alright, um, do you, now, Alan, you were talking about something earlier that you'd seen about

01:53:07.040 --> 01:53:08.040
this whole mess, right?

01:53:08.040 --> 01:53:13.440
Yeah, I've been reading on Joystiq and Kotaku about a free tech demo that Epic released,

01:53:13.440 --> 01:53:18.260
um, this week called Epic Citadel for the iPhone 4, and also for the new iPod Touches

01:53:18.260 --> 01:53:22.640
that are coming out, and it's basically the engine that this, uh, sword game is gonna

01:53:22.640 --> 01:53:28.280
be running on, but it's pretty much just you and the touch interface and, like, a town,

01:53:28.280 --> 01:53:32.200
and all you can do is really just walk around and look at stuff, but the graphics, I guess,

01:53:32.200 --> 01:53:36.580
the way they ported the Unreal engine into the phone is so good that you just can't believe

01:53:36.580 --> 01:53:40.360
that you're getting this on an iPhone, and the videos for it, for those that want to

01:53:40.360 --> 01:53:45.560
look it up on Google, it's called Epic Citadel, it's free on the App Store, so whoever has

01:53:45.560 --> 01:53:48.240
a new iPhone can download it and check it out, it's supposed to be amazing.

01:53:48.240 --> 01:53:49.240
I'm downloading it right now.

01:53:49.240 --> 01:53:53.320
You know, it's really sad, is all they would really have to do now with the iPhone to really

01:53:53.320 --> 01:53:57.080
kind of compete in the market, well, I mean, they already are competing in the market with,

01:53:57.080 --> 01:53:59.640
like, the Nintendo DS and the PSP, but they're really kind of...

01:53:59.640 --> 01:54:03.560
Well, they came out at the conference, they took a shot at Nintendo and Sony and said

01:54:03.560 --> 01:54:08.320
that they've sold more than those two combined, although it's, it's fuzzy math, but yeah.

01:54:08.320 --> 01:54:09.320
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I understand.

01:54:09.320 --> 01:54:10.320
Alright, I'm downloading it.

01:54:10.320 --> 01:54:14.800
But to basically kind of deliver that finishing blow, if you would put it, if they added,

01:54:14.800 --> 01:54:19.160
like, some sort of actual buttons, you know, some sort of controller interface to that,

01:54:19.160 --> 01:54:22.160
it would be, I mean, how are you going to compete with that?

01:54:22.160 --> 01:54:26.440
I mean, now you've got, you know, a platform that's very popular, the apps are really cheap,

01:54:26.440 --> 01:54:30.120
and the games are actually getting to be on par, if not better, than some of the stuff

01:54:30.120 --> 01:54:31.640
that's on the PSP and on the DS.

01:54:31.640 --> 01:54:36.120
Yeah, it really is the one thing that the iPhone, iTouch, whatever is missing is a tangible

01:54:36.120 --> 01:54:37.120
controller.

01:54:37.120 --> 01:54:40.800
I mean, if they could have that, it would be amazing.

01:54:40.800 --> 01:54:46.680
When you were playing Sonic 2 on the iPhone 4 at the Apple Store, they had to bring the

01:54:46.680 --> 01:54:50.240
screen in a little bit to, like, a little thumbnail so that it could put a little, a

01:54:50.240 --> 01:54:53.880
digital D-pad and buttons on there, and it really affected the gameplay.

01:54:53.880 --> 01:54:56.040
Yeah, it sure did.

01:54:56.040 --> 01:54:57.520
So we'll see.

01:54:57.520 --> 01:55:02.080
An alpha-kinanogram in our chatroom at chat.orangesondre.com agrees, seriously, Apple just needs to make

01:55:02.080 --> 01:55:03.560
a controller shell for it.

01:55:03.560 --> 01:55:08.320
Takeo Ray in our chatroom says, yes, Epic Citadel is all eye candy, and it looks sweet.

01:55:08.320 --> 01:55:14.000
Here's something, I mean, we've kind of thrown this idea out for a while now, um, you know,

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.000
what if Apple made a gaming console?

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:17.920
Well, what if they did that?

01:55:17.920 --> 01:55:21.600
I mean, the Apple TV's down to $99, who's to say they can't come up with some sort of

01:55:21.600 --> 01:55:24.280
wireless Bluetooth controller or something that works with Apple?

01:55:24.280 --> 01:55:26.200
All they have to do is put iOS on that box.

01:55:26.200 --> 01:55:28.320
Yeah, iOS on the box to make it, you know, a more...

01:55:28.320 --> 01:55:29.320
Yeah, a wireless controller.

01:55:29.320 --> 01:55:32.520
Maybe a little bit more powerful, you know, like, kind of like an iPhone or something

01:55:32.520 --> 01:55:33.520
like that.

01:55:33.520 --> 01:55:38.960
And, you know, then now your games are really cheap, it's all digital, but, you know, and

01:55:38.960 --> 01:55:40.120
make a portable system.

01:55:40.120 --> 01:55:41.600
They're gonna...

01:55:41.600 --> 01:55:45.160
Sony better step up, because, seriously, right now they're really slacking as far as their

01:55:45.160 --> 01:55:50.400
system goes, and, you know, they're gonna lose it really quick.

01:55:50.400 --> 01:55:51.400
We'll see.

01:55:51.400 --> 01:55:55.200
All right, well, speaking of the iPhone, Mirror's Edge and Puzzle Agent also came out on the

01:55:55.200 --> 01:55:56.200
iPhone.

01:55:56.200 --> 01:55:57.600
Those were releases earlier this week.

01:55:57.600 --> 01:56:01.960
Uh, Mirror's Edge, uh, was already out on the iPad, but now it's on the iPhone.

01:56:01.960 --> 01:56:06.000
On the iPad it was ten bucks, and now it's only gonna be five bucks on the iPhone.

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:10.640
Uh, Telltale is, uh, trying out a game release on, uh, iPhone.

01:56:10.640 --> 01:56:11.640
It's Puzzle Agent.

01:56:11.640 --> 01:56:14.200
You might remember this came out on PCs a little bit ago.

01:56:14.200 --> 01:56:19.520
Uh, that is, uh, where Telltale games are about approximately on the other iDevices.

01:56:19.520 --> 01:56:24.360
So, um, yeah, they're on the App Store, and, uh, check those out if you, uh, are interested

01:56:24.360 --> 01:56:25.520
in either of those series.

01:56:25.520 --> 01:56:29.760
Uh, otherwise, going back to the more traditional consoles, on the Xbox Live Arcade, uh, King

01:56:29.760 --> 01:56:35.520
of Fighters Sky Stage is supposed to be hitting the Japanese Xbox Live Arcade on September

01:56:35.520 --> 01:56:36.520
15th.

01:56:36.520 --> 01:56:39.960
Uh, it's gonna be costing, uh, ten dollars, eight, eight hundred Microsoft Points, or

01:56:39.960 --> 01:56:41.520
whatever that converts to in Yen.

01:56:41.520 --> 01:56:47.840
Uh, and that is the one, by the way, where, like, Terry Bogard and Mai are, like, shooters.

01:56:47.840 --> 01:56:51.120
This is that one that's the whole, like, King of Fighters are in a shooting game.

01:56:51.120 --> 01:56:52.120
Remember that?

01:56:52.120 --> 01:56:53.120
Yeah.

01:56:53.120 --> 01:56:54.120
That's this game.

01:56:54.120 --> 01:56:57.720
So, a lot of the, uh, horizontal screen real estate is just taken up with pretty pictures

01:56:57.720 --> 01:56:59.880
of, of Terry and Mai there.

01:56:59.880 --> 01:57:05.200
And lastly, for my little bit here, Tron Evolution has a release date, and there's also a sweet

01:57:05.200 --> 01:57:06.840
collector's edition to go with it.

01:57:06.840 --> 01:57:08.760
The release date is December 7th.

01:57:08.760 --> 01:57:10.800
I think that's a couple weeks before the movie.

01:57:10.800 --> 01:57:14.920
Uh, Tron, it, it's kind of interesting that Disney's doing this twice, because Epic Mickey

01:57:14.920 --> 01:57:16.760
has a collector's edition, too.

01:57:16.760 --> 01:57:21.680
But, uh, with Tron Evolution, for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, there will be the, um, collector's

01:57:21.680 --> 01:57:22.680
edition.

01:57:22.680 --> 01:57:28.520
It comes with a toy model light cycle from Schlight, from Sideshow Collectibles, a display

01:57:28.520 --> 01:57:31.860
case for it with a drawer to keep the game in.

01:57:31.860 --> 01:57:36.520
It's $130, which, you know, so you're paying an extra, what, $70 for this figurine, but

01:57:36.520 --> 01:57:39.960
I gotta say, that's a sweet-looking figurine.

01:57:39.960 --> 01:57:42.200
That's, it's like a little light bike from the new movie.

01:57:42.200 --> 01:57:47.400
That is, I don't know if I, if it actually lit up, I might have to do it, but, uh, no

01:57:47.400 --> 01:57:48.400
word on that yet.

01:57:48.400 --> 01:57:51.200
I would just wait and see, because they're gonna have collectible toys and stuff, I'm

01:57:51.200 --> 01:57:52.840
sure, when the Tron stuff comes out.

01:57:52.840 --> 01:57:53.840
Very true.

01:57:53.840 --> 01:57:57.320
You could probably buy one standalone that would be a lot cooler than that.

01:57:57.320 --> 01:58:02.640
Um, it just, those collector's editions, man, sometimes it's a real waste of money.

01:58:02.640 --> 01:58:05.680
However, though, you know, the Black Ops one that they have coming out now with that

01:58:05.680 --> 01:58:08.840
little car that has, like, a camera on it and stuff?

01:58:08.840 --> 01:58:14.160
Those things are actually out now as some other device, um, but, I mean, they're really

01:58:14.160 --> 01:58:19.440
popular in, like, the hacking community, because they're so easy to modify to do a bunch of

01:58:19.440 --> 01:58:22.960
different things, like installing Linux and crap on it and stuff, so it might be a good

01:58:22.960 --> 01:58:27.440
buy to actually get that, or if, you know, you're smart, you'll just go buy the actual

01:58:27.440 --> 01:58:32.120
toy that's out now instead of spending, you know, the extra money.

01:58:32.120 --> 01:58:36.600
Tron is awesome, but any game that's a movie tie-in, eh, not sure of what.

01:58:36.600 --> 01:58:37.920
I don't know, this game looks pretty awesome.

01:58:37.920 --> 01:58:41.680
I gotta say, I played it at E3, and it was kinda cool, because it was like Prince of

01:58:41.680 --> 01:58:46.200
Persia, but with Tron graphics, and, like, apparently it's heavily influenced with Capoeira,

01:58:46.200 --> 01:58:48.120
like all the fighting is based on Capoeira.

01:58:48.120 --> 01:58:52.520
I gotta say, it was kinda rad, but Shane was watching me play it, and, you know, Shane

01:58:52.520 --> 01:58:55.720
didn't really see Tron as a kid, because I think he was, like, born the year it came

01:58:55.720 --> 01:59:02.480
out or something, um, so, like, I know, right, so I think, like, he was looking at it going,

01:59:02.480 --> 01:59:06.600
there's not a lot of graphics in this game, what is, and I'm like, that's, it looks like

01:59:06.600 --> 01:59:11.200
Tron, Tron looked like that, you don't understand, it's okay, it's stylistic, so he wasn't as

01:59:11.200 --> 01:59:14.240
into it as I was, though, but I was playing the demo, and I was like, this is cool.

01:59:14.240 --> 01:59:19.720
Yeah, they have a little cinematic teaser or something, or maybe an intro, or one of

01:59:19.720 --> 01:59:24.120
the cutscenes in the game, but they have it where, you know, the main guy, cause it kinda

01:59:24.120 --> 01:59:28.640
reminds me a lot of, like, the forts unleashed, almost, you know, he's chasing after these

01:59:28.640 --> 01:59:35.240
guys on light cycles and stuff, and one of the recognizers, and, you know, he's chasing

01:59:35.240 --> 01:59:38.800
after them, and all of a sudden, you know, he kills one of them with the disc on the

01:59:38.800 --> 01:59:45.480
actual light cycle, and then they start shooting at him, he jumps up, like runs along the wall,

01:59:45.480 --> 01:59:49.980
and then transforms back into the light cycle again, it's just fucking sweet.

01:59:49.980 --> 01:59:53.300
I gotta admit, every time, like, I've been to the movies a couple times lately, and that

01:59:53.300 --> 01:59:57.040
trailer usually plays, and every time they show the trailer for the new Tron movie, I

01:59:57.040 --> 02:00:00.400
get a little stiffy, it looks awesome.

02:00:00.400 --> 02:00:07.120
We need to see that in 3D, IMAX, in with those D-Box motion seats, just do the full shebang.

02:00:07.120 --> 02:00:12.280
As soon as those tickets go on sale, like, I'm almost wanting to go to L.A. just to see

02:00:12.280 --> 02:00:17.200
it at the official Disney theater, cause I'm that crazy.

02:00:17.200 --> 02:00:18.200
I'd go with you.

02:00:18.200 --> 02:00:19.200
I know you would.

02:00:19.200 --> 02:00:21.200
If you paid for gas.

02:00:21.200 --> 02:00:22.200
Maybe.

02:00:22.200 --> 02:00:23.200
We'll see.

02:00:23.200 --> 02:00:24.200
Really?

02:00:24.200 --> 02:00:25.200
We'll see.

02:00:25.200 --> 02:00:27.200
You gotta pay your own way into Disneyland if we go by there, but, we'll figure that

02:00:27.200 --> 02:00:28.200
out.

02:00:28.200 --> 02:00:29.200
We may not have two.

02:00:29.200 --> 02:00:30.200
We'll see, we'll see.

02:00:30.200 --> 02:00:34.440
Alright, speaking of Disneyland, now here, now Dark Sakura, as if that wasn't enough,

02:00:34.440 --> 02:00:35.440
wait for this.

02:00:35.440 --> 02:00:38.000
It's a Tron world, after all.

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:41.200
Yeah, they are actually putting Tron in Disneyland.

02:00:41.200 --> 02:00:43.480
No people movers not coming back, sadly.

02:00:43.480 --> 02:00:47.960
Get this, Electronica launches in October.

02:00:47.960 --> 02:00:49.920
It's the digital dance party.

02:00:49.920 --> 02:00:54.760
It's going in Disney California Adventure, and they're gonna turn the Hollywood section

02:00:54.760 --> 02:01:01.000
of California Adventure into this whole, like, Tron section, it's like a big dance party.

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:04.120
They're gonna do a recreation of Flynn Arcade.

02:01:04.120 --> 02:01:08.840
It'll be at Electronica, and, uh, yeah, it's gonna be this huge event that starts October

02:01:08.840 --> 02:01:09.840
8th.

02:01:09.840 --> 02:01:10.840
I better have all the games in there.

02:01:10.840 --> 02:01:11.840
And this is what pisses me off.

02:01:11.840 --> 02:01:14.920
That's a week after I'm gonna be there anyway for gay days.

02:01:14.920 --> 02:01:15.920
So mad.

02:01:15.920 --> 02:01:16.920
Bitches.

02:01:16.920 --> 02:01:18.720
But, that means I have to go back.

02:01:18.720 --> 02:01:22.960
So it's October 8th until, I think, we need to go.

02:01:22.960 --> 02:01:24.440
Like, are we that crazy?

02:01:24.440 --> 02:01:25.440
Yes.

02:01:25.440 --> 02:01:26.440
Yes.

02:01:26.440 --> 02:01:27.440
We're going.

02:01:27.440 --> 02:01:28.800
So there'll be no show the week the Tron movie comes out because Dark Sakura and I

02:01:28.800 --> 02:01:34.480
are gonna go see, uh, see it at the official 3D Disney theater in Anaheim.

02:01:34.480 --> 02:01:35.480
Yes.

02:01:35.480 --> 02:01:36.480
Yes, we are.

02:01:36.480 --> 02:01:37.480
Wow.

02:01:37.480 --> 02:01:42.040
We're gonna travel across country to see a movie in a theater.

02:01:42.040 --> 02:01:43.040
Yes.

02:01:43.040 --> 02:01:45.160
We're worse than the Twilight fans in some regards.

02:01:45.160 --> 02:01:51.840
If only we could do that here and see a movie in a theater.

02:01:51.840 --> 02:01:56.360
But you don't understand because then when it's over, we can go to the Electronica party,

02:01:56.360 --> 02:01:59.540
and then we can ride Space Mountain a million times.

02:01:59.540 --> 02:02:02.760
They should actually redo Space Mountain as Tron Mountain for the movie.

02:02:02.760 --> 02:02:07.060
Well there's a rumor that if the Tron thing is really successful and the movie does really

02:02:07.060 --> 02:02:10.920
well that the Tomorrowland arcade is going to permanently be Flynn's arcade.

02:02:10.920 --> 02:02:14.280
That will make me completely giddy.

02:02:14.280 --> 02:02:15.280
Yeah.

02:02:15.280 --> 02:02:16.280
I think that's the way it should be too.

02:02:16.280 --> 02:02:17.280
So everybody is.

02:02:17.280 --> 02:02:20.880
I hope that the reproduction Flynn's that they do is gonna have all the old games and

02:02:20.880 --> 02:02:21.880
everything too.

02:02:21.880 --> 02:02:22.880
I don't care.

02:02:22.880 --> 02:02:27.520
It apparently is the same as our game that's been at like Comic Con and some of that stuff

02:02:27.520 --> 02:02:28.880
has been traveling around a little bit.

02:02:28.880 --> 02:02:32.020
But I don't care if this new Tron movie is terrible.

02:02:32.020 --> 02:02:36.720
You all need to satisfy like what I've built it up in my mind of seeing this as a child

02:02:36.720 --> 02:02:39.440
and you all need to go see this movie opening day so it does well.

02:02:39.440 --> 02:02:40.760
And dude, it's twice.

02:02:40.760 --> 02:02:42.320
It's Flynn's the bad guy.

02:02:42.320 --> 02:02:44.280
At least I think he is.

02:02:44.280 --> 02:02:45.280
Or is he?

02:02:45.280 --> 02:02:47.560
It might be a clone.

02:02:47.560 --> 02:02:49.200
It's Clues the bad guy.

02:02:49.200 --> 02:02:50.200
All right.

02:02:50.200 --> 02:02:51.200
Anyway.

02:02:51.200 --> 02:02:52.200
Yeah.

02:02:52.200 --> 02:02:53.200
I'm so excited.

02:02:53.200 --> 02:02:56.600
Takeo Ray is in our chat room saying, oh, the marathon's affecting Sky already.

02:02:56.600 --> 02:02:58.800
Stiffy's crazy trips to Disneyland.

02:02:58.800 --> 02:02:59.800
It's over.

02:02:59.800 --> 02:03:00.800
Uh, chat.orangeontrader.com.

02:03:00.800 --> 02:03:02.440
Uh, let's see.

02:03:02.440 --> 02:03:03.440
Break Man.

02:03:03.440 --> 02:03:05.660
Disney's gonna make a live nerd dance party.

02:03:05.660 --> 02:03:06.920
Yes they are.

02:03:06.920 --> 02:03:07.920
Nerd dance party.

02:03:07.920 --> 02:03:11.080
And you know if Dark Soccer and I are gonna be there, it's an extra nerd dance party.

02:03:11.080 --> 02:03:13.920
We need to figure out what day that is and like announce our arrival well in advance.

02:03:13.920 --> 02:03:15.480
We need sparkly silver clothes.

02:03:15.480 --> 02:03:17.580
Cause we need to get some of our LA peeps to gum.

02:03:17.580 --> 02:03:18.580
We need Marissa.

02:03:18.580 --> 02:03:19.580
We need Marissa.

02:03:19.580 --> 02:03:21.620
Uh, to, to shake her boobies at this.

02:03:21.620 --> 02:03:26.200
We need DJ Tyrant to show up and, and write a story for the website once every six months

02:03:26.200 --> 02:03:27.200
or so.

02:03:27.200 --> 02:03:28.200
Disneyland friends.

02:03:28.200 --> 02:03:29.200
People who work there.

02:03:29.200 --> 02:03:30.200
Yes.

02:03:30.200 --> 02:03:31.200
We love you.

02:03:31.200 --> 02:03:32.200
Yeah.

02:03:32.200 --> 02:03:33.960
We need, we need our cast member friends that work there to show up.

02:03:33.960 --> 02:03:36.840
We need a, I know we have other LA listeners, so we're going to figure out what day this

02:03:36.840 --> 02:03:38.960
is and the minute tickets go on sales.

02:03:38.960 --> 02:03:39.960
We got to get them.

02:03:39.960 --> 02:03:40.960
Okay.

02:03:40.960 --> 02:03:41.960
You're doing this.

02:03:41.960 --> 02:03:42.960
Oh my God.

02:03:42.960 --> 02:03:43.960
I'm so excited.

02:03:43.960 --> 02:03:44.960
Maybe Scott can come with you.

02:03:44.960 --> 02:03:45.960
Scott's in LA.

02:03:45.960 --> 02:03:46.960
Yeah.

02:03:46.960 --> 02:03:47.960
There we go.

02:03:47.960 --> 02:03:48.960
I don't know.

02:03:48.960 --> 02:03:50.440
I don't know if this, of course I'm making all these plans while Dan's in the other room

02:03:50.440 --> 02:03:58.840
going, probably going the fuck she is, Dan, we're going to go see Tron at Disneyland.

02:03:58.840 --> 02:03:59.840
Okay.

02:03:59.840 --> 02:04:02.080
He said, Oh, we have it on the air.

02:04:02.080 --> 02:04:03.480
Dan, I'll take it.

02:04:03.480 --> 02:04:04.480
Put Dan in the car.

02:04:04.480 --> 02:04:06.480
Dan's coming with us.

02:04:06.480 --> 02:04:07.480
I don't care.

02:04:07.480 --> 02:04:08.480
We ain't working.

02:04:08.480 --> 02:04:09.480
All right.

02:04:09.480 --> 02:04:10.480
Anyhow.

02:04:10.480 --> 02:04:14.520
Spazinator in chat says Sky will try to get Loki to build him a real light cycle.

02:04:14.520 --> 02:04:15.520
I just might.

02:04:15.520 --> 02:04:16.520
All right.

02:04:16.520 --> 02:04:17.520
I don't know how to build motorcycles.

02:04:17.520 --> 02:04:19.520
Well, you better learn real quick.

02:04:19.520 --> 02:04:20.520
Okay.

02:04:20.520 --> 02:04:23.520
Let's move on with some other quick stories that was supposed to be a quick story ended

02:04:23.520 --> 02:04:24.520
up taking like 15 minutes.

02:04:24.520 --> 02:04:25.520
Dark Sakura.

02:04:25.520 --> 02:04:31.880
Namco is remaking arcade classics actually, um, coming out for we is going to be Namco

02:04:31.880 --> 02:04:39.600
museum mega mix, which has, um, different remixed games, um, like the Gallagher remix,

02:04:39.600 --> 02:04:42.120
um, the Pac-Man rail shooter thing.

02:04:42.120 --> 02:04:48.200
Um, there's also going to be though, um, an old school game called Grobda remix, which

02:04:48.200 --> 02:04:50.160
is a shimupi game.

02:04:50.160 --> 02:04:51.160
So yay.

02:04:51.160 --> 02:04:55.560
Also of course, Pac-Man, Mappy, Rally X, Galaga, wah wah.

02:04:55.560 --> 02:05:01.200
And then, um, for Sims 3 fans like myself, Barnacle Bay, they're getting on the big pirate

02:05:01.200 --> 02:05:02.360
bandwagon.

02:05:02.360 --> 02:05:06.160
And you know what my theory about this is, is that, okay, they're putting out downloadable

02:05:06.160 --> 02:05:13.040
content so that you can have a, you know, like a, it's a whole town of piratey goodness,

02:05:13.040 --> 02:05:16.560
but I think they're really getting the inspiration from all these players that have made their

02:05:16.560 --> 02:05:19.360
own pirate stuff.

02:05:19.360 --> 02:05:22.340
So there's like, oh, we'll do it too.

02:05:22.340 --> 02:05:24.960
So anyway, it's going to be, uh, coming out.

02:05:24.960 --> 02:05:26.720
Can you make Johnny Depp walk the plank?

02:05:26.720 --> 02:05:27.720
I wish.

02:05:27.720 --> 02:05:33.320
Um, and then, um, for, uh, people who may be a little bit pissed off with Xbox in September,

02:05:33.320 --> 02:05:35.040
there's Halo freebies.

02:05:35.040 --> 02:05:36.480
Yay.

02:05:36.480 --> 02:05:42.320
So with the launch of Halo Reach, um, it's going to be, uh, uh, the 14th through 20th

02:05:42.320 --> 02:05:49.640
will be invasion week and, um, you get new gear, exciting content, help Microsoft, spectacular

02:05:49.640 --> 02:05:52.560
prizes, and a chance to play with creators of the game.

02:05:52.560 --> 02:05:54.200
And that was a quote.

02:05:54.200 --> 02:06:01.520
Um, also Xbox live gold, um, uh, features to silver members on September 17th, 2017

02:06:01.520 --> 02:06:03.280
through 20th.

02:06:03.280 --> 02:06:06.880
And anyone who gets online can download the invasion theme.

02:06:06.880 --> 02:06:12.960
Um, I just see master chiefs running around in party hats.

02:06:12.960 --> 02:06:18.880
Also as well, um, resident evil five avatar outfits and game add ons will be discounted.

02:06:18.880 --> 02:06:25.640
September 13th puzzle games, um, uh, we'll be getting the, uh, DOTW deal best to move

02:06:25.640 --> 02:06:32.200
live puzzle Chronicles tower blocks, deluxe or knock down, um, to 400 Microsoft points,

02:06:32.200 --> 02:06:40.680
five bucks and gerrymancers going from a 1200 to 800 and then a rock band three avatar stuff.

02:06:40.680 --> 02:06:48.000
And, uh, I also on the marketplaces bully scholarship edition and cabellas African safari,

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:50.040
which isn't Africa.

02:06:50.040 --> 02:06:53.720
Speaking of all this, are we allowed to talk about what I'm dance playing in the front

02:06:53.720 --> 02:06:54.720
room right now?

02:06:54.720 --> 02:06:56.360
Or is that like a no, no topic?

02:06:56.360 --> 02:06:57.360
No, no.

02:06:57.360 --> 02:06:58.360
Okay.

02:06:58.360 --> 02:06:59.360
No, no.

02:06:59.360 --> 02:07:00.360
Nevermind.

02:07:00.360 --> 02:07:01.360
This completely unrelated to what we were just talking about.

02:07:01.360 --> 02:07:06.120
I mean, we can talk about it, but I don't know where he got it.

02:07:06.120 --> 02:07:07.120
Me neither.

02:07:07.120 --> 02:07:08.120
Oh, sweet.

02:07:08.120 --> 02:07:13.360
Oh, we're getting more people committing to coming to all this could be awesome.

02:07:13.360 --> 02:07:14.360
All right.

02:07:14.360 --> 02:07:15.360
Anyhow.

02:07:15.360 --> 02:07:17.360
Um, let's move on.

02:07:17.360 --> 02:07:19.840
Uh, did you have a story you want to do?

02:07:19.840 --> 02:07:20.840
Loki?

02:07:20.840 --> 02:07:21.840
Yeah, sure.

02:07:21.840 --> 02:07:22.840
Oh wait, I got to do Twitter topics.

02:07:22.840 --> 02:07:23.840
Oh my gosh.

02:07:23.840 --> 02:07:24.840
I don't want to forget the tweets.

02:07:24.840 --> 02:07:25.840
Let's do Twitter topics.

02:07:25.840 --> 02:07:26.840
Okay.

02:07:26.840 --> 02:07:27.840
That'll give you a little more time to think about that story.

02:07:27.840 --> 02:07:35.320
Twitter.com slash O L R. If you want to send us a tweet, we only have a few tonight probably

02:07:35.320 --> 02:07:36.640
because I said, don't send us links.

02:07:36.640 --> 02:07:37.640
Also.

02:07:37.640 --> 02:07:41.080
I don't think I could, I'd be, I don't think tiger claws and chat tonight, like, is he

02:07:41.080 --> 02:07:42.080
okay?

02:07:42.080 --> 02:07:45.440
He might've, he probably went on vacation for labor day.

02:07:45.440 --> 02:07:46.440
Like most people do.

02:07:46.440 --> 02:07:49.000
So I'm just, I, every night I expect to see links from tiger claw.

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:50.000
They're not there tonight.

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:53.280
So I was, I just, what do we need to send a search party to his home?

02:07:53.280 --> 02:07:57.760
Cause this is not typical, but I think he's, I think he's probably on a trip.

02:07:57.760 --> 02:08:02.440
All right, let's move on.

02:08:02.440 --> 02:08:08.200
Uh, our, our good buddy, uh, Jay Jugo and uh, on Twitter is saying breakdown for the

02:08:08.200 --> 02:08:12.680
wind by OLR because they're playing the old school, uh, music tonight from our old rotation,

02:08:12.680 --> 02:08:16.760
which is all the old, uh, all the old Bahmani music and so forth.

02:08:16.760 --> 02:08:22.360
Uh, Marin Marvel speaking of people we may or may not see at the Tron thing is OLR marathon

02:08:22.360 --> 02:08:25.120
night, a horrible night to have a curse.

02:08:25.120 --> 02:08:26.120
Yes.

02:08:26.120 --> 02:08:29.560
Um, what curse, what would be a bad curse to have during the, what would be a bad curse

02:08:29.560 --> 02:08:31.600
to have during the OLR marathon?

02:08:31.600 --> 02:08:32.600
Literary vampires.

02:08:32.600 --> 02:08:35.240
Probably diarrhea would be a bad curse to have actually during this night.

02:08:35.240 --> 02:08:38.240
So we better not get pizza.

02:08:38.240 --> 02:08:40.240
All right.

02:08:40.240 --> 02:08:44.160
Um, let's see more, uh, tweets here.

02:08:44.160 --> 02:08:49.400
Leo Shen sends us a tweet, blaze blue continuum shift two announced for arcades and three

02:08:49.400 --> 02:08:51.120
new characters are on the way.

02:08:51.120 --> 02:08:54.400
He does link us to the official website and I don't think this is a story that even comes

02:08:54.400 --> 02:08:55.400
up later.

02:08:55.400 --> 02:08:59.160
The, now the official website is all in Japanese, so I can't say a whole lot else with this,

02:08:59.160 --> 02:09:04.000
but, uh, for those of you guys that are fans of this series, you played this game, right?

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:07.120
Uh, Alan, I think Loki, you might have a little bit too.

02:09:07.120 --> 02:09:12.320
I have, yeah, I have the, um, the arcade version on my cabinet.

02:09:12.320 --> 02:09:13.880
Did you have this one game fly one week?

02:09:13.880 --> 02:09:17.800
It was the very first game I got with game fly and I brought it over to your house.

02:09:17.800 --> 02:09:19.760
So I guess that weekend a new one coming out.

02:09:19.760 --> 02:09:20.760
So that's pretty cool.

02:09:20.760 --> 02:09:21.760
All right.

02:09:21.760 --> 02:09:27.800
Uh, tail Ray sends us a tweet, would y'all be interested in doing the extra life marathon

02:09:27.800 --> 02:09:28.800
this year?

02:09:28.800 --> 02:09:33.760
Donations go to your local CMN hospital, which if I'm not mistaken is children's miracle

02:09:33.760 --> 02:09:34.760
network.

02:09:34.760 --> 02:09:35.760
I think.

02:09:35.760 --> 02:09:38.240
Uh, I do remember these tweets from last year.

02:09:38.240 --> 02:09:39.560
God, has it been a year already?

02:09:39.560 --> 02:09:40.560
I guess so.

02:09:40.560 --> 02:09:42.720
Uh, October 16th.

02:09:42.720 --> 02:09:43.720
Whew.

02:09:43.720 --> 02:09:46.600
Um, it depends.

02:09:46.600 --> 02:09:47.600
We do.

02:09:47.600 --> 02:09:49.680
We try to do this last year and something happened.

02:09:49.680 --> 02:09:53.000
Uh, yeah, it just didn't work out.

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:54.000
Something happened.

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:55.000
It didn't work out.

02:09:55.000 --> 02:10:00.480
Um, uh, if we can't participate directly, we'll definitely donate at least.

02:10:00.480 --> 02:10:04.320
Uh, but we'll see, I don't want to commit just yet, especially after doing a marathon

02:10:04.320 --> 02:10:05.320
tonight.

02:10:05.320 --> 02:10:09.400
Um, I don't know if we could do like a full, full, full marathon, especially ever having

02:10:09.400 --> 02:10:10.400
just done one tonight.

02:10:10.400 --> 02:10:11.400
We should have waited, huh?

02:10:11.400 --> 02:10:14.120
Uh, but we'll see.

02:10:14.120 --> 02:10:17.200
I just don't want to promise and not have it happen cause that's happened before and

02:10:17.200 --> 02:10:19.960
it felt like we felt really poopy doing that.

02:10:19.960 --> 02:10:21.760
So, but we'll see.

02:10:21.760 --> 02:10:25.000
If nothing else, we will mention it lots on the show and help donate.

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:28.160
Uh, Spazinator PSN sends us some tweets.

02:10:28.160 --> 02:10:33.200
For those that have a PS3 and care, there's an episode of Campus PD on the PSN store that's

02:10:33.200 --> 02:10:34.920
temporarily free.

02:10:34.920 --> 02:10:36.920
It's under TV shows and free.

02:10:36.920 --> 02:10:39.180
Hey, I like free things.

02:10:39.180 --> 02:10:40.180
That's good.

02:10:40.180 --> 02:10:41.840
Campus PD is like cops, but with more boobs.

02:10:41.840 --> 02:10:43.320
Is there, is that what it really is?

02:10:43.320 --> 02:10:45.020
Yeah, that's what Campus PD is.

02:10:45.020 --> 02:10:46.020
It's wow.

02:10:46.020 --> 02:10:47.880
And interestingly enough, it's on G4.

02:10:47.880 --> 02:10:49.800
Oh, wow.

02:10:49.800 --> 02:10:51.640
This is what I watched early in the morning.

02:10:51.640 --> 02:10:53.280
Drunken sorority chicks?

02:10:53.280 --> 02:10:58.080
It's it's basically just cops on, like there was an episode of that I watched that they

02:10:58.080 --> 02:11:04.200
were busting some guys for having, you know, pot in a frat house or something like that

02:11:04.200 --> 02:11:05.960
because they saw it through a window.

02:11:05.960 --> 02:11:11.760
And so they came in and it was just a bunch of hippie college kids complaining that you

02:11:11.760 --> 02:11:14.840
don't have the right to enter my premises, blah, blah, blah, blah.

02:11:14.840 --> 02:11:15.840
It's in plain sight.

02:11:15.840 --> 02:11:16.840
I see it right here.

02:11:16.840 --> 02:11:19.920
Therefore, it gives us, you know, probable cause to enter your residence.

02:11:19.920 --> 02:11:24.000
So shut the fuck up, Mr. Law Major.

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:25.260
Pot in a frat house?

02:11:25.260 --> 02:11:26.260
You don't say.

02:11:26.260 --> 02:11:27.260
I know.

02:11:27.260 --> 02:11:28.260
Get out.

02:11:28.260 --> 02:11:29.260
Get right out of town.

02:11:29.260 --> 02:11:30.260
It was.

02:11:30.260 --> 02:11:31.260
No.

02:11:31.260 --> 02:11:32.260
Oh, my gosh.

02:11:32.260 --> 02:11:36.280
I just used to call stuff like that VCRs.

02:11:36.280 --> 02:11:39.320
We called my friends rats VCRs.

02:11:39.320 --> 02:11:42.280
Next thing you tell me, there's going to be underage drinking in the dormitories.

02:11:42.280 --> 02:11:43.280
Don't.

02:11:43.280 --> 02:11:46.400
And then they have the new season that has, they have the spring break season that's coming

02:11:46.400 --> 02:11:47.400
out this fall.

02:11:47.400 --> 02:11:53.840
That's basically just more chicks and if you've watched Cops in like Mardi Gras or whatever,

02:11:53.840 --> 02:11:59.000
they have that episode or whatever, Ho Ho Ho, their special, like, you know, episodes

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:03.120
with all the prostitutes that they're picking up and stuff.

02:12:03.120 --> 02:12:05.080
Put your top back on, ma'am.

02:12:05.080 --> 02:12:06.080
Ma'am.

02:12:06.080 --> 02:12:08.120
Put your shirt back on, ma'am.

02:12:08.120 --> 02:12:09.120
Come with me, ma'am.

02:12:09.120 --> 02:12:11.880
We had anything to drink tonight, ma'am.

02:12:11.880 --> 02:12:12.880
Yeah.

02:12:12.880 --> 02:12:16.240
I mean, it's, yeah.

02:12:16.240 --> 02:12:17.240
Wonderful programming.

02:12:17.240 --> 02:12:18.240
This is what they put.

02:12:18.240 --> 02:12:20.320
Can you believe Cops is still on?

02:12:20.320 --> 02:12:25.640
Like Cops started like when Fox Network started in like 87 and it is still on.

02:12:25.640 --> 02:12:27.760
Well, that America's most wanted.

02:12:27.760 --> 02:12:28.760
Still going.

02:12:28.760 --> 02:12:29.760
That's true.

02:12:29.760 --> 02:12:32.200
John Walsh, John Walsh still hosted after all these years?

02:12:32.200 --> 02:12:33.200
Probably.

02:12:33.200 --> 02:12:36.560
Didn't they finally find who killed his son like just not that long ago and it turned

02:12:36.560 --> 02:12:37.560
out the guy died?

02:12:37.560 --> 02:12:42.920
Well, the guy that was already in prison, I think, kept confessing and then recanting

02:12:42.920 --> 02:12:46.600
it like four times so they couldn't, but yeah, it's probably on his Wikipedia.

02:12:46.600 --> 02:12:47.600
Oh, probably.

02:12:47.600 --> 02:12:49.680
That was a horrible story, though, what happened?

02:12:49.680 --> 02:12:50.680
Yeah.

02:12:50.680 --> 02:12:51.680
Because he was, it actually involves video games.

02:12:51.680 --> 02:12:53.680
He was playing like an Atari 2600 when he got kidnapped, right?

02:12:53.680 --> 02:12:55.680
Or something like that, at a Sears or something?

02:12:55.680 --> 02:12:56.680
I think so.

02:12:56.680 --> 02:12:57.680
Or watching other kids play it, I think?

02:12:57.680 --> 02:12:58.680
I don't know.

02:12:58.680 --> 02:12:59.680
Anyway.

02:12:59.680 --> 02:13:00.680
Sorry.

02:13:00.680 --> 02:13:01.680
Don't mean to be a downer on the show.

02:13:01.680 --> 02:13:02.680
Wah wah.

02:13:02.680 --> 02:13:03.680
Wah wah.

02:13:03.680 --> 02:13:04.680
Wah wah.

02:13:04.680 --> 02:13:05.680
That was it for the Twitter topics.

02:13:05.680 --> 02:13:09.320
We'll have more tweets later on in the evening at Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

02:13:09.320 --> 02:13:11.960
I'll be tweeting random stuff and Klingon, by the way.

02:13:11.960 --> 02:13:12.960
Thank you.

02:13:12.960 --> 02:13:13.960
From mine.

02:13:13.960 --> 02:13:16.600
Dark Tetsuya says that Salacious Pop does a great state trooper.

02:13:16.600 --> 02:13:18.560
There you go.

02:13:18.560 --> 02:13:19.560
Ma'am, please.

02:13:19.560 --> 02:13:23.200
Ma'am, don't walk, don't run out into the street, ma'am.

02:13:23.200 --> 02:13:24.200
Put your shirt on.

02:13:24.200 --> 02:13:25.880
Into the car, ma'am.

02:13:25.880 --> 02:13:28.600
Brakeman in the chat says, ma'am, please put your shirt back on.

02:13:28.600 --> 02:13:32.800
Oh, sorry, I meant sir.

02:13:32.800 --> 02:13:34.600
Clearly that individual had moobs.

02:13:34.600 --> 02:13:35.600
Alright.

02:13:35.600 --> 02:13:39.400
Loki, do you have some more news for us?

02:13:39.400 --> 02:13:40.400
Yes.

02:13:40.400 --> 02:13:44.600
Music Unlimited is a service that's rumored, well, was rumored to be coming to the Sony

02:13:44.600 --> 02:13:45.600
platforms.

02:13:45.600 --> 02:13:48.880
It is now confirmed to be coming to the Sony platforms, as opposed to PlayStation 3 and

02:13:48.880 --> 02:13:50.480
PSP.

02:13:50.480 --> 02:13:59.360
It is, I guess, powered by curiosity, which is not a word, but according to Sony it is.

02:13:59.360 --> 02:14:05.480
It is apparently going to be a music service that's cloud based that'll, at least it'll

02:14:05.480 --> 02:14:11.640
be coming out in Europe, and subscribers will have access to millions of songs, and then

02:14:11.640 --> 02:14:16.240
of course it's going to be very similar to kind of the Zoom pass that's on, you know,

02:14:16.240 --> 02:14:17.920
Microsoft service.

02:14:17.920 --> 02:14:23.160
And so in addition, the service will be compatible with Bravia TVs, Blu-ray disc players, home

02:14:23.160 --> 02:14:29.280
theater systems, and Vio computers, with one single account without a need to manage digital

02:14:29.280 --> 02:14:31.740
files so you can listen to a bunch of stuff.

02:14:31.740 --> 02:14:36.160
So am I correct in assuming this is just more of that corporate synergy with Sony music?

02:14:36.160 --> 02:14:37.160
I think so, yeah.

02:14:37.160 --> 02:14:41.600
And so probably a movie thing is, well I guess they already have movies on Sony Marketplace,

02:14:41.600 --> 02:14:45.000
so I guess, never mind, but maybe more TV.

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:47.000
Just want a piece of the apple pie.

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:48.960
Piece of the apple pie.

02:14:48.960 --> 02:14:51.200
All coming together.

02:14:51.200 --> 02:14:57.040
I mean, I guess if they've had movies and TV all this time, I mean, where the hell's

02:14:57.040 --> 02:14:58.040
the music been?

02:14:58.040 --> 02:15:02.200
Once in a while they'll have like a game soundtrack or something, but you know, they haven't done

02:15:02.200 --> 02:15:04.600
a major music store at all, that's for sure.

02:15:04.600 --> 02:15:09.880
They haven't done anything major on their services.

02:15:09.880 --> 02:15:12.400
So yeah, I don't know.

02:15:12.400 --> 02:15:13.400
Alright.

02:15:13.400 --> 02:15:18.800
Well, let's move on and talk about, going back to the iPhone stuff a little bit, I actually

02:15:18.800 --> 02:15:23.080
have, I used to play this game a lot, it was Aurora Faint, it was kind of a Bejeweledy

02:15:23.080 --> 02:15:24.840
type game that they have on the iPhone.

02:15:24.840 --> 02:15:27.320
Well these guys are really taking these to the next level.

02:15:27.320 --> 02:15:33.000
They've written their own platform called Open Faint, which is sort of what you could

02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:38.120
say inspired the whole Game Center thing that Apple is set to launch, I believe next week,

02:15:38.120 --> 02:15:41.800
which in turn is sort of their version of Xbox Live.

02:15:41.800 --> 02:15:44.920
Open Faint, of course, trying to be competitive with the press conference and some of the

02:15:44.920 --> 02:15:49.760
news about Game Center that came out, has announced their own deal here.

02:15:49.760 --> 02:15:54.200
Aurora Faint is making Open Faint and it's called Playtime is this new thing.

02:15:54.200 --> 02:16:02.600
It's going to be a real-time multiplayer gameplay, get this, between iOS and Android devices.

02:16:02.600 --> 02:16:07.640
It's bridging the gap and that's something Game Center, you know, is never going to do.

02:16:07.640 --> 02:16:09.360
So Playtime is actually going to bridge that gap.

02:16:09.360 --> 02:16:14.960
It will allow real-time voice chat during the gameplay across these platforms.

02:16:14.960 --> 02:16:19.940
CEO Jason Citrone of Aurora Faint said, quote, traditionally, multiplayer technology has

02:16:19.940 --> 02:16:22.560
been accessible only to top-tier developers.

02:16:22.560 --> 02:16:25.040
It's just too complicated and time-consuming.

02:16:25.040 --> 02:16:31.720
So he invented Playtime, which literally takes one day to integrate into a casual game.

02:16:31.720 --> 02:16:36.320
More information about this, VoIP lobbies and matchmaking for casual games, expanding

02:16:36.320 --> 02:16:41.920
to incorporate team-based voice chat, 16-player game servers for the core titles.

02:16:41.920 --> 02:16:43.600
So it definitely sounds like they're trying to build this thing up.

02:16:43.600 --> 02:16:45.400
And as far as I know, it doesn't cost money.

02:16:45.400 --> 02:16:46.400
Here's the thing, though.

02:16:46.400 --> 02:16:51.300
The games I've noticed on my phone that do support this, it kind of gets in the way.

02:16:51.300 --> 02:16:56.400
You only have so much real estate on the iPhone screen and I sort of get annoyed when I try

02:16:56.400 --> 02:17:01.280
to launch a game and I get this whole, register now for Open Faint, you do do.

02:17:01.280 --> 02:17:05.200
And I'm just like, fuck off, I want to play my Commodore 64 emulator.

02:17:05.200 --> 02:17:12.040
You know, I don't need VoIP to play The Last Ninja on the Commodore 64, get out.

02:17:12.040 --> 02:17:16.560
So some of it is kind of annoying, like they need to tone it down a little bit.

02:17:16.560 --> 02:17:18.240
You know, it's nice that it's there.

02:17:18.240 --> 02:17:19.560
This technology is cool.

02:17:19.560 --> 02:17:23.480
I think it's great that they're bridging the gap, but don't throw it in my face.

02:17:23.480 --> 02:17:28.800
Like stop, have it a little button in the corner that I can use.

02:17:28.800 --> 02:17:32.840
I guess it hides once you do kind of sign in, it's just annoying.

02:17:32.840 --> 02:17:37.920
I don't like trying to go into a game for the first time and it's like, sign up!

02:17:37.920 --> 02:17:42.560
Like Tap Tap Revenge 3 I tried playing for the first time and it's like, sign up for

02:17:42.560 --> 02:17:47.520
Tapulous and connect to your Facebook and like, fuck off!

02:17:47.520 --> 02:17:51.040
I just want to tap my screen in time to stuff.

02:17:51.040 --> 02:17:52.040
What are you looking at over there, DarkStalker?

02:17:52.040 --> 02:17:53.040
Is that that...

02:17:53.040 --> 02:17:54.040
Epic Citadel.

02:17:54.040 --> 02:17:56.000
Oh, the Epic Citadel thing we were just talking about earlier?

02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:57.000
That's pretty damn nice.

02:17:57.000 --> 02:17:58.000
Nice.

02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:01.000
Maybe I'll take some screen captures.

02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:03.360
We'll see.

02:18:03.360 --> 02:18:04.360
Let's see.

02:18:04.360 --> 02:18:10.660
I have no idea how to pronounce this, Beta CNCRA, it says, I don't care about ads, they

02:18:10.660 --> 02:18:11.880
should go die.

02:18:11.880 --> 02:18:12.880
Go away ads.

02:18:12.880 --> 02:18:17.140
Well, I understand that ads are what it takes to support some free things, but some of these

02:18:17.140 --> 02:18:19.760
like open, faint games are things I pay for.

02:18:19.760 --> 02:18:21.520
And that's where things get really annoying.

02:18:21.520 --> 02:18:23.520
So I'm just saying.

02:18:23.520 --> 02:18:24.520
Anyhow.

02:18:24.520 --> 02:18:27.920
Chat.OrangeLawnsRadio.com if you want to chat with us live here at Orange Lawns Radio as

02:18:27.920 --> 02:18:32.340
we tape our super long episode today, Labor Day Weekend.

02:18:32.340 --> 02:18:35.400
Dark Soccer, are you going to have to put that down and talk about what you've got in

02:18:35.400 --> 02:18:36.400
gaming news?

02:18:36.400 --> 02:18:37.400
Stuff.

02:18:37.400 --> 02:18:38.400
Like?

02:18:38.400 --> 02:18:42.680
Hey, can you give me a chance to finish?

02:18:42.680 --> 02:18:50.920
Well, you know, American McGee is doing another Alice game, Alice Madness Returns.

02:18:50.920 --> 02:18:56.400
But it's going to be not over the top, so they're saying.

02:18:56.400 --> 02:19:00.760
It's going to be adult and mature.

02:19:00.760 --> 02:19:06.280
But it's definitely going to be an M-rated title, but it's not like they're doing it

02:19:06.280 --> 02:19:08.220
just to make it an M-rated title.

02:19:08.220 --> 02:19:16.560
They want it to be, you know, with the established universe, but have it be something more for

02:19:16.560 --> 02:19:18.120
an adult to grasp.

02:19:18.120 --> 02:19:19.120
Not for kids.

02:19:19.120 --> 02:19:21.380
It's not Disney.

02:19:21.380 --> 02:19:28.220
And they don't want to make it extra violent, extra gory, extra bloody.

02:19:28.220 --> 02:19:35.080
They want the content itself, the subject matter, to be where it gets the M-rating.

02:19:35.080 --> 02:19:38.200
If that makes sense.

02:19:38.200 --> 02:19:39.680
I think it's going to be fun.

02:19:39.680 --> 02:19:44.320
I mean, it's not going to be like over the top Mortal Kombat style blood, but they still,

02:19:44.320 --> 02:19:46.000
you know, Alice is still going to cut things, right?

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:48.640
I'm sure if she stabs something, it'll bleed.

02:19:48.640 --> 02:19:51.080
Just won't, you know, gush a geyser of blood.

02:19:51.080 --> 02:19:53.360
I'm really not sure how to take a news story like that.

02:19:53.360 --> 02:19:57.760
It's like they're saying like, well, we're not trying to go for a mature rating, but

02:19:57.760 --> 02:20:01.960
our game will have mature content, but it's necessary to the plot.

02:20:01.960 --> 02:20:06.000
That's like telling an actress, like, your topless scene is integral to the plot.

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:07.000
Like it's.

02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:08.000
It always is.

02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:12.480
It's statistically important to the story that you're naked in this scene.

02:20:12.480 --> 02:20:18.040
Highbrow going for exactly like, you know, when the killer gets you in the shower, you

02:20:18.040 --> 02:20:21.680
see, you need to be topless because you're in the shower.

02:20:21.680 --> 02:20:30.400
Like I'm talking about like dealing with like mental illness or an abusive childhood topless

02:20:30.400 --> 02:20:36.940
scenes or I agree the type of the type of topic though considered mature and adult would

02:20:36.940 --> 02:20:42.000
be something like the character itself is supposed to be kind of nuts and living a very

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:43.560
unhappy life.

02:20:43.560 --> 02:20:45.840
And a brothel full of topless women.

02:20:45.840 --> 02:20:51.400
Well, usually the the protagonists in Silent Hill games, once you finally find out what

02:20:51.400 --> 02:20:54.880
their origin is, it's like, whoa, that's really messed up.

02:20:54.880 --> 02:21:03.120
He did what to his wife or like the little girl who her special bad guy was the the daddy

02:21:03.120 --> 02:21:06.880
chained to the door with the knife trying to do dirty things.

02:21:06.880 --> 02:21:12.560
Takeo Ray in our chat room says the 3D boobs in Piranha 3D were very important to its plot.

02:21:12.560 --> 02:21:16.960
That's a movie I haven't seen yet, but I think I need to, even though I think that a lot

02:21:16.960 --> 02:21:22.440
of those gore movies are kind of stupid, like it's like when it knows it's over the top.

02:21:22.440 --> 02:21:26.160
Sometimes they're really funny, but sometimes you got to have boobs in there just to show

02:21:26.160 --> 02:21:27.160
your cheese.

02:21:27.160 --> 02:21:31.540
But what I don't understand is that they're like, there's actually a version.

02:21:31.540 --> 02:21:32.540
This was great.

02:21:32.540 --> 02:21:33.540
It was in the local paper.

02:21:33.540 --> 02:21:36.120
They were talking about the local drive ins and how they're still going.

02:21:36.120 --> 02:21:40.040
And they were showing Piranha at the drive in, but it's not 3D because you can't do 3D

02:21:40.040 --> 02:21:41.040
on a drive in screen.

02:21:41.040 --> 02:21:45.540
And they were interviewing this lady who took her, it had nothing to do with this fact,

02:21:45.540 --> 02:21:46.540
but it should have.

02:21:46.540 --> 02:21:50.800
She took her six and eight year old to go see Piranha.

02:21:50.800 --> 02:21:53.720
And I'm not one to tell you what to do with your kids, but at the same time, I couldn't

02:21:53.720 --> 02:21:57.640
help and look at that, but go really, really bad parenting.

02:21:57.640 --> 02:22:03.040
You're going to take your six year old to go see Piranha and it's not even in 3D.

02:22:03.040 --> 02:22:04.040
Does that make it better?

02:22:04.040 --> 02:22:05.140
I don't know.

02:22:05.140 --> 02:22:10.000
And then you take them to the lake the next day and then they don't want to go to the

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:11.000
lake anymore.

02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:15.240
Dartetsuya says, oh, speaking of gore movies, apparently Saw is getting a 3D version.

02:22:15.240 --> 02:22:16.240
Do not want.

02:22:16.240 --> 02:22:17.240
I heard that.

02:22:17.240 --> 02:22:18.240
Do not want.

02:22:18.240 --> 02:22:19.240
See, there's one.

02:22:19.240 --> 02:22:22.440
See, I like it when it's over the top, but I don't like it when it tries to be real like

02:22:22.440 --> 02:22:23.440
Saw does.

02:22:23.440 --> 02:22:24.440
Do you want to see Machete?

02:22:24.440 --> 02:22:25.440
I want to see Machete.

02:22:25.440 --> 02:22:30.160
Derek H in chat says Machete has fake Lindsay Lohan boobs.

02:22:30.160 --> 02:22:33.880
I heard there was nudity from La Lohan in that.

02:22:33.880 --> 02:22:39.240
As I described, as I described Machete this morning, it's a movie based off a trailer

02:22:39.240 --> 02:22:42.440
based off a fake movie.

02:22:42.440 --> 02:22:43.440
Definitely want to see it.

02:22:43.440 --> 02:22:44.440
You know what else is cool?

02:22:44.440 --> 02:22:47.520
They saw a new trailer for Hobo with a Shotgun.

02:22:47.520 --> 02:22:48.520
What?

02:22:48.520 --> 02:22:49.520
Yeah.

02:22:49.520 --> 02:22:51.440
Hobo with a Shotgun is also from Grindhouse.

02:22:51.440 --> 02:22:56.060
It was actually, they had a contest to have people create a fan trailer and that was the

02:22:56.060 --> 02:22:59.640
one that won and now it's actually going to become a real movie.

02:22:59.640 --> 02:23:00.640
Hobo with a Shotgun.

02:23:00.640 --> 02:23:01.640
Wow.

02:23:01.640 --> 02:23:02.880
Can I, can I share some news real quick?

02:23:02.880 --> 02:23:04.240
I guess.

02:23:04.240 --> 02:23:09.000
For players who play Star Trek Online, the C store is having a Labor Day sale, so I just

02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:10.640
thought I'd share.

02:23:10.640 --> 02:23:13.240
For all two of you that are playing Star Trek Online.

02:23:13.240 --> 02:23:14.240
Hey!

02:23:14.240 --> 02:23:21.400
Alright, moving on, Loki and me and then the mailbag at mailbagatorangeontradio.com.

02:23:21.400 --> 02:23:24.080
Oh yes.

02:23:24.080 --> 02:23:31.520
So you know, of course the Microsoft, you know, summer gaming thing worked out really

02:23:31.520 --> 02:23:37.920
well for them, so they're going to do it again, but this time in the fall.

02:23:37.920 --> 02:23:42.960
And they're going to call it the Microsoft Xbox Live Arcade Game Feast Promotion.

02:23:42.960 --> 02:23:45.040
And there will be of course a bunch of games coming out.

02:23:45.040 --> 02:23:52.800
It's I guess starting September 29th with Hydrophobia for 1200 Microsoft points, followed

02:23:52.800 --> 02:23:58.160
by Comic Jumper on October 6th, also for 1200 Microsoft points.

02:23:58.160 --> 02:24:02.400
Pinball FX 2 will be available October 13th, and guess what?

02:24:02.400 --> 02:24:04.200
It's free!

02:24:04.200 --> 02:24:08.520
And you can import your tables from the first Pinball FX game with each additional table

02:24:08.520 --> 02:24:09.720
being purchased individually.

02:24:09.720 --> 02:24:11.400
Well I like free!

02:24:11.400 --> 02:24:12.880
Free is good!

02:24:12.880 --> 02:24:20.600
Finally, also Super Meat Boy will be coming out October 20th to wrap the whole thing up.

02:24:20.600 --> 02:24:24.840
So that'll also be 1200 Microsoft points.

02:24:24.840 --> 02:24:29.120
Hopefully we'll be able to give you guys previews on each of these games soon because I've played

02:24:29.120 --> 02:24:35.480
most of them already, so we will talk about them in coming weeks.

02:24:35.480 --> 02:24:36.480
Alrighty.

02:24:36.480 --> 02:24:41.760
Any of those games you think are worth buying based off of what you've played so far?

02:24:41.760 --> 02:24:42.880
Comic Jumper was kind of fun.

02:24:42.880 --> 02:24:49.240
It was a beat-em-up game, it has a really neat looking, it's kind of like a, oh, Comic

02:24:49.240 --> 02:24:52.920
Zone but HD-ish.

02:24:52.920 --> 02:24:55.800
The main character is kind of weird looking though.

02:24:55.800 --> 02:24:58.400
He looks like a Ninja Turtle almost.

02:24:58.400 --> 02:25:07.400
Ninja Turtle crossed with like, I don't know, some sort of Flash Gordon and Deadpool.

02:25:07.400 --> 02:25:08.760
And then Super Meat Boy is supposed to be really good.

02:25:08.760 --> 02:25:12.000
I was just disappointed that it was broken on a, you know.

02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:14.120
Well it won't stay broken forever.

02:25:14.120 --> 02:25:16.560
Yeah, it'll fix it eventually.

02:25:16.560 --> 02:25:19.200
And Hydrophobia, I don't know about Hydrophobia.

02:25:19.200 --> 02:25:25.760
Hey, price drop, the DSI and the DSI extra-large are going to be getting a, excuse me, hiccup

02:25:25.760 --> 02:25:26.760
at a bad time.

02:25:26.760 --> 02:25:27.760
Whoops.

02:25:27.760 --> 02:25:31.040
In North America, the DSI and DSI extra-large are getting a price drop.

02:25:31.040 --> 02:25:35.280
It's effective September 12th, so not just yet but real soon.

02:25:35.280 --> 02:25:41.720
The handhelds will now be 150 for the DSI and 170 for the DSI XL.

02:25:41.720 --> 02:25:44.100
Time to clear out that inventory before the 3DS comes out.

02:25:44.100 --> 02:25:46.600
It's exactly what this is all about.

02:25:46.600 --> 02:25:49.600
Price drops have also already happened in the UK and Japan.

02:25:49.600 --> 02:25:52.020
I believe Australia had one as well.

02:25:52.020 --> 02:25:56.600
So we're kind of the last one to be able to get on board with this.

02:25:56.600 --> 02:26:00.680
This is to drive sales during the holiday season for those parents that aren't really

02:26:00.680 --> 02:26:03.680
up and up on the stuff that's coming out in gaming.

02:26:03.680 --> 02:26:08.640
And so they will spend their money and buy a DSI XL and then the 3DS will come out and

02:26:08.640 --> 02:26:09.880
they'll have to buy that too.

02:26:09.880 --> 02:26:12.280
So it's a win-win.

02:26:12.280 --> 02:26:15.240
So yay, price drops and all that good stuff.

02:26:15.240 --> 02:26:18.120
All right, let's move on to the mailbag.

02:26:18.120 --> 02:26:22.960
Every week you guys send us emails and you know, if we feel like it, we'll read them.

02:26:22.960 --> 02:26:27.180
No, we all, of course, of course we're going to read emails from you guys.

02:26:27.180 --> 02:26:30.360
Mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com is the place to send those emails.

02:26:30.360 --> 02:26:35.360
We're going to have Dark Sakura open up the old mailbag and dive in and pull out a letter

02:26:35.360 --> 02:26:44.680
right now, but not until I play the music.

02:26:44.680 --> 02:26:49.720
We actually got two emails, but I figured maybe in two hours I'll check the email, the

02:26:49.720 --> 02:26:50.720
mailbox again.

02:26:50.720 --> 02:26:51.720
Sure.

02:26:51.720 --> 02:26:52.720
Yeah.

02:26:52.720 --> 02:26:56.120
If you want to send more emails, we'll, we'll check for more emails later on tonight.

02:26:56.120 --> 02:26:57.120
Sure.

02:26:57.120 --> 02:26:58.520
Um, first one.

02:26:58.520 --> 02:26:59.520
Hello.

02:26:59.520 --> 02:27:01.200
I can finally listen live to your show.

02:27:01.200 --> 02:27:03.640
OLR starts at 3 AM on Monday in Belgium.

02:27:03.640 --> 02:27:05.400
Still, I can't call in tonight.

02:27:05.400 --> 02:27:06.400
I'll wake everyone.

02:27:06.400 --> 02:27:07.800
Show starts at 11 PM.

02:27:07.800 --> 02:27:10.320
Anyways, I have a question for Loki.

02:27:10.320 --> 02:27:15.480
I have all Sega guns, light phaser, menacer, stunner, slash virtua gun, and the dreamcast

02:27:15.480 --> 02:27:16.480
gun.

02:27:16.480 --> 02:27:20.400
My problem is that none of these guns, except for the menacer, work on newer TVs.

02:27:20.400 --> 02:27:23.760
I currently don't have room for an old TV, so I was wondering if I could make these guns

02:27:23.760 --> 02:27:26.680
work on a modern LCD TV.

02:27:26.680 --> 02:27:27.680
And I'll just go ahead and close the email.

02:27:27.680 --> 02:27:29.240
Thanks for a weekly OLR, you guys.

02:27:29.240 --> 02:27:30.240
You're so awesome.

02:27:30.240 --> 02:27:31.240
Cyberbeast, Belgium.

02:27:31.240 --> 02:27:32.240
No, you can't.

02:27:32.240 --> 02:27:33.240
Sorry.

02:27:33.240 --> 02:27:39.040
And that's unfortunate, but you're not going to be able to do that because newer guns that

02:27:39.040 --> 02:27:45.600
they have out now basically kind of have little light sensor bars or some sort of sensor bar

02:27:45.600 --> 02:27:48.200
that attaches to the TV that you would use.

02:27:48.200 --> 02:27:49.200
It's like Wii style.

02:27:49.200 --> 02:27:55.780
Yeah, it's like the Wii or even if you want to go even older school, like the Power Glove.

02:27:55.780 --> 02:28:02.360
It's basically just something because they can't do the refresh stuff on the TVs anymore,

02:28:02.360 --> 02:28:04.620
so that's what the solution is now.

02:28:04.620 --> 02:28:10.320
So unfortunately, you're not going to be able to use those on newer TVs.

02:28:10.320 --> 02:28:12.320
That should answer the question.

02:28:12.320 --> 02:28:13.320
Last email.

02:28:13.320 --> 02:28:14.320
Hey guys.

02:28:14.320 --> 02:28:15.760
Molten Brown here.

02:28:15.760 --> 02:28:19.040
I was just- Ew.

02:28:19.040 --> 02:28:20.840
It could be chocolate.

02:28:20.840 --> 02:28:21.840
I hope so.

02:28:21.840 --> 02:28:25.680
I was just listening to your last show and I wanted to take a shot at figuring out THQ's

02:28:25.680 --> 02:28:27.200
warped reasoning.

02:28:27.200 --> 02:28:30.900
Perhaps to THQ, the amount that they sell to their distributors depends on how many

02:28:30.900 --> 02:28:32.940
people will buy the game new.

02:28:32.940 --> 02:28:36.760
Since the distributors will only buy what they think they will be able to sell.

02:28:36.760 --> 02:28:40.480
If the distributors are having a hard time unloading the new game because people are

02:28:40.480 --> 02:28:45.080
buying it used, then they will decrease the amount of new games they buy from the producers.

02:28:45.080 --> 02:28:48.480
This means that in the end, THQ and other producers will get less money since distributors

02:28:48.480 --> 02:28:50.160
are buying less of their game.

02:28:50.160 --> 02:28:55.160
While I don't agree with this reasoning, nor THQ's stance towards used gamers, I can-

02:28:55.160 --> 02:28:58.760
I'm thinking of used gamers, like the gamers themselves being used.

02:28:58.760 --> 02:28:59.760
I can-

02:28:59.760 --> 02:29:01.400
I feel so used today.

02:29:01.400 --> 02:29:02.400
I'm stent.

02:29:02.400 --> 02:29:05.440
I can buy this program.

02:29:05.440 --> 02:29:10.040
I can kind of see where they are coming from since they are in the business to make money.

02:29:10.040 --> 02:29:13.040
Sad though it is, that's what it boils down to.

02:29:13.040 --> 02:29:17.560
Well, keep up the good work and hopefully next time I will be awake enough to send a

02:29:17.560 --> 02:29:19.300
longer email with some questions.

02:29:19.300 --> 02:29:21.320
Your dutiful listener, Molten Brown.

02:29:21.320 --> 02:29:23.120
The not gross version of Molten Brown.

02:29:23.120 --> 02:29:28.180
Sadly, I don't think that's the case at all and here's why I don't think that.

02:29:28.180 --> 02:29:32.760
Because the first game that they pulled that on was UFC 2010.

02:29:32.760 --> 02:29:38.200
And really, they wouldn't have announced it to anybody until the day the game was released,

02:29:38.200 --> 02:29:44.940
except the fact that Destructoid got a hold of, you know, I guess a source of somebody

02:29:44.940 --> 02:29:49.280
who purchased the game before the street date and found out that it had this whole thing

02:29:49.280 --> 02:29:50.280
on there anyways.

02:29:50.280 --> 02:29:52.440
They weren't going to tell anybody about it until last minute.

02:29:52.440 --> 02:29:57.160
Now, if the whole thing was to drive up sales of new products, they would have had to let

02:29:57.160 --> 02:30:02.200
everybody know right away or at least a lot earlier than the street date in order to get

02:30:02.200 --> 02:30:09.000
people to say, oh well, if I can't buy it used and connect online and have to pay this

02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:12.440
extra money, I need to go buy it new now.

02:30:12.440 --> 02:30:15.660
If that's their plan to drive sales up, really it's not.

02:30:15.660 --> 02:30:20.500
It's all about them getting some extra money for selling a used title.

02:30:20.500 --> 02:30:24.920
Really something that they really shouldn't have money for in the first place because

02:30:24.920 --> 02:30:30.040
if you are, you know, buying the game new, well, someone's got to buy the game new at

02:30:30.040 --> 02:30:33.800
one point and in that case, you know, the money that they would have made from that

02:30:33.800 --> 02:30:37.200
sale would go to, you know, supporting the online stuff.

02:30:37.200 --> 02:30:41.080
If someone else say, you know, if I happen to give my game to somebody else to play,

02:30:41.080 --> 02:30:46.720
why should they have to pay an extra $10 to basically take up as much space on their network

02:30:46.720 --> 02:30:48.200
as I was previously?

02:30:48.200 --> 02:30:50.600
I don't see the point.

02:30:50.600 --> 02:30:55.700
All it is is just a cash grab and they claim it's to make their online service better,

02:30:55.700 --> 02:31:02.760
but if you can't, you know, if you can't make your online service better within the $60

02:31:02.760 --> 02:31:05.280
price point, then you need to raise the price of your games.

02:31:05.280 --> 02:31:09.920
Whether that's popular or not with your consumers, that's the risk you're going to have to take

02:31:09.920 --> 02:31:14.040
if that's really an issue for you, but really it doesn't come down to making their service

02:31:14.040 --> 02:31:18.120
better because as far as I'm aware, the UFC stuff, I don't think they've really done anything

02:31:18.120 --> 02:31:21.040
to their online service, made it really awesome.

02:31:21.040 --> 02:31:24.280
I don't think anyone's going, oh my God, the online UFC is so sweet.

02:31:24.280 --> 02:31:26.560
This is way better than every other game I've ever played.

02:31:26.560 --> 02:31:29.400
I don't think that's the case at all and I don't think that's ever going to be the case

02:31:29.400 --> 02:31:30.440
with this stuff.

02:31:30.440 --> 02:31:34.880
It's just an excuse that they're using to try to justify charging you an extra $10 if

02:31:34.880 --> 02:31:36.720
you buy the game used.

02:31:36.720 --> 02:31:42.840
So Break Man in their chat room says, quite simply, if that's a plan to drive up sales,

02:31:42.840 --> 02:31:43.840
it's not a very good plan.

02:31:43.840 --> 02:31:44.840
Yeah.

02:31:44.840 --> 02:31:54.480
Because if that was their intent was to drive up new sales, because the way it works, it

02:31:54.480 --> 02:31:59.600
goes either you're going to have your direct consumers or your direct retailers that you're

02:31:59.600 --> 02:32:04.000
working with, like the Game Stops and whatever, or the distributors that they're working with.

02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:09.280
So either way, they have customers that need to place orders with those companies, then

02:32:09.280 --> 02:32:14.080
those companies say, okay, we have X number of pieces on order, here's how many pieces

02:32:14.080 --> 02:32:20.040
we think we need, what we have on order plus a little bit of extra of a pad to sell later

02:32:20.040 --> 02:32:21.040
on.

02:32:21.040 --> 02:32:22.960
And that's what they place with the actual publisher.

02:32:22.960 --> 02:32:29.120
If their intent was on driving up new game sales, then they would have let that news

02:32:29.120 --> 02:32:33.420
out a lot earlier so that people would go, oh, okay, well then they need to buy a new

02:32:33.420 --> 02:32:40.240
version of this game instead so that I can get my online content for no additional price,

02:32:40.240 --> 02:32:44.720
which really doesn't make any sense anyways.

02:32:44.720 --> 02:32:48.200
So they would have to do that in order for that to actually be true.

02:32:48.200 --> 02:32:56.180
But they didn't, and now they're even talking about raising the price from $5 to $10.

02:32:56.180 --> 02:32:59.760
So I think it's just a big old cash grab.

02:32:59.760 --> 02:33:00.880
That's all it is.

02:33:00.880 --> 02:33:05.440
At some point, the video game market is going to crash under the weight of all this.

02:33:05.440 --> 02:33:07.460
It's because they think they need some extra money.

02:33:07.460 --> 02:33:11.680
They think that, oh, hey, well we can make money off of each use sale because these damn

02:33:11.680 --> 02:33:15.240
use sales, they're cutting into our new game sales.

02:33:15.240 --> 02:33:19.360
Well, I don't know if that's the case at all because I think a lot of people that are planning

02:33:19.360 --> 02:33:23.520
on buying those use games weren't going to buy your game new anyways.

02:33:23.520 --> 02:33:24.520
Exactly.

02:33:24.520 --> 02:33:25.520
Exactly.

02:33:25.520 --> 02:33:31.200
And so regardless of the fact that you don't have online or online's extra or something

02:33:31.200 --> 02:33:35.440
like that, they may just say, you know what, I don't need that game at all, and then they'll

02:33:35.440 --> 02:33:39.440
be resentful against you and not buy your product going forward.

02:33:39.440 --> 02:33:41.080
So it may have a negative impact.

02:33:41.080 --> 02:33:44.760
And I think overall, it's not a really good move, but a lot of people are going to move

02:33:44.760 --> 02:33:46.280
that direction anyways.

02:33:46.280 --> 02:33:48.280
All right.

02:33:48.280 --> 02:33:54.120
Let's move on to, I guess, appropriately following up all this ranting, a segment we do here

02:33:54.120 --> 02:34:15.000
on the show every week called the FUs of the week, FU to having to take algebra.

02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:19.640
Not that it's a hard class, just that I hate math.

02:34:19.640 --> 02:34:24.000
FU to people that drive really slow in front of me or that are lost and don't seem to know

02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:25.000
where they're going.

02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:28.620
I like, I hate people that all of a sudden just cut over a couple lanes because they

02:34:28.620 --> 02:34:29.620
miss their turn.

02:34:29.620 --> 02:34:30.620
You know what?

02:34:30.620 --> 02:34:34.600
If you miss your turn, you need to make a U-turn and then correct it that way instead

02:34:34.600 --> 02:34:39.320
of just going, Oh my God, and cutting off everybody.

02:34:39.320 --> 02:34:43.560
I don't really have a lot of angst, so I'll go with the driver FU to FU to SUV that totally

02:34:43.560 --> 02:34:45.640
cut me off merging on an I-80 today.

02:34:45.640 --> 02:34:47.640
She was a bitch.

02:34:47.640 --> 02:34:48.640
Alan?

02:34:48.640 --> 02:34:51.760
Uh, FU to hot weather, I guess.

02:34:51.760 --> 02:34:52.760
I don't know.

02:34:52.760 --> 02:34:53.760
I'm pretty mellow right now.

02:34:53.760 --> 02:34:55.040
It's cause you live in Silent Hill.

02:34:55.040 --> 02:34:56.040
I do.

02:34:56.040 --> 02:34:57.040
Where it's always cold.

02:34:57.040 --> 02:34:58.040
Yes.

02:34:58.040 --> 02:34:59.040
And I'm not lying.

02:34:59.040 --> 02:35:00.640
When you drive up the hill to get to Alan's house, it suddenly gets foggy.

02:35:00.640 --> 02:35:02.640
It could be the middle of August and it's like fog.

02:35:02.640 --> 02:35:04.640
Bradley, how you doing over there?

02:35:04.640 --> 02:35:05.640
Do you have a nephew?

02:35:05.640 --> 02:35:06.640
I have a nephew.

02:35:06.640 --> 02:35:09.800
I'll have no free time starting Wednesday again for a few months.

02:35:09.800 --> 02:35:10.800
Why is that?

02:35:10.800 --> 02:35:12.400
Oh, my second job starts up again.

02:35:12.400 --> 02:35:13.400
Oh, good times.

02:35:13.400 --> 02:35:14.400
Good times.

02:35:14.400 --> 02:35:15.400
All right.

02:35:15.400 --> 02:35:16.400
Good luck.

02:35:16.400 --> 02:35:17.400
All right.

02:35:17.400 --> 02:35:20.000
That's it for the FUs of the week.

02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:23.840
A few more news stories and then we'll get into your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:35:23.840 --> 02:35:28.240
Won't be the first time tonight we'll be taking calls, but we will take some calls.

02:35:28.240 --> 02:35:29.240
All right.

02:35:29.240 --> 02:35:31.240
Uh, Loki, what do you got?

02:35:31.240 --> 02:35:35.280
Um, Retro City Rampage is a game that they're showing off at PAX right now.

02:35:35.280 --> 02:35:40.480
It's a WiiWare game that originally was supposed to be an NES title that was gonna be a port

02:35:40.480 --> 02:35:45.920
of Grand Theft Auto 3, but then something happened where that didn't end up coming out.

02:35:45.920 --> 02:35:54.040
Now it's kind of a Grand Theft Auto 1 and 2 type of game, but it's now just all sorts

02:35:54.040 --> 02:35:57.120
of references for different 8-bit games that are in here.

02:35:57.120 --> 02:36:01.360
It's supposed to be coming out on WiiWare in December, but I mean they have everything

02:36:01.360 --> 02:36:08.820
from Contra references to Metal Gear to just all sorts of neat gameplay.

02:36:08.820 --> 02:36:12.760
It just looks really cool and it's all done in kind of an 8-bit style.

02:36:12.760 --> 02:36:18.040
And once again, actually that was the Grand Theft Auto 3 that ran on the NES is called

02:36:18.040 --> 02:36:23.160
Project Grand Theft Endo was the original thing.

02:36:23.160 --> 02:36:27.480
But it's really, really cool.

02:36:27.480 --> 02:36:29.560
So definitely worth checking out once it comes out.

02:36:29.560 --> 02:36:33.560
Hope it does actually come to Xbox Live Arcade or PlayStation Network as they were saying.

02:36:33.560 --> 02:36:40.000
So that looks like a sweet game.

02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:41.200
It actually does look really sweet.

02:36:41.200 --> 02:36:44.800
I like those games that kind of like get in the retro, although I don't know, I wasn't

02:36:44.800 --> 02:36:47.760
super duper into the Scott Pilgrim game for some reason.

02:36:47.760 --> 02:36:53.600
Like it was okay, but maybe I didn't, I don't think I played enough of it actually, so I

02:36:53.600 --> 02:36:54.600
don't know.

02:36:54.600 --> 02:36:56.600
You're going to be picking this up though, Loki?

02:36:56.600 --> 02:37:00.920
Yeah, I haven't really played the Wii in a long time, but I, I definitely.

02:37:00.920 --> 02:37:03.360
Mine's still not, I didn't even buy the new Metroid.

02:37:03.360 --> 02:37:06.760
I know that might be like shocking in awe, but I'm kind of just waiting for it to come

02:37:06.760 --> 02:37:08.920
out on Xbox 360.

02:37:08.920 --> 02:37:13.160
Like in my mind, I'm like, it'll come out on the 360 at some point.

02:37:13.160 --> 02:37:14.160
Right.

02:37:14.160 --> 02:37:15.160
Or the PS3.

02:37:15.160 --> 02:37:16.160
I know.

02:37:16.160 --> 02:37:17.160
I know.

02:37:17.160 --> 02:37:20.200
I'm being stupid right now, but yeah, that's it.

02:37:20.200 --> 02:37:23.680
And Rama's yelling at me saying, you need to play more Scott Pilgrim.

02:37:23.680 --> 02:37:24.680
I know.

02:37:24.680 --> 02:37:25.680
I do.

02:37:25.680 --> 02:37:26.680
All right.

02:37:26.680 --> 02:37:31.600
Going on to a one more story before the calls, you guys, uh, the fast racing league is something

02:37:31.600 --> 02:37:32.720
coming out on WiiWare.

02:37:32.720 --> 02:37:35.440
It's the futuristic fast racing league.

02:37:35.440 --> 02:37:36.560
Hmm.

02:37:36.560 --> 02:37:37.720
What could this be?

02:37:37.720 --> 02:37:43.160
It's a jet rocket, I guess is the, uh, folks that make the game or is this, no, no, it's,

02:37:43.160 --> 02:37:45.000
uh, that's the other game they made.

02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:47.120
Shinen is the name of the company.

02:37:47.120 --> 02:37:50.640
Uh, they're making this game, a game called fast racing league.

02:37:50.640 --> 02:37:52.520
All there is is promotion art.

02:37:52.520 --> 02:37:54.920
Uh, but there you go.

02:37:54.920 --> 02:37:59.200
My thought when I look at this though, is that, gee, somebody's making F zero for the

02:37:59.200 --> 02:38:00.200
Wii.

02:38:00.200 --> 02:38:02.080
It's that they're not just calling it F zero.

02:38:02.080 --> 02:38:04.400
It's it's fast racing league.

02:38:04.400 --> 02:38:06.200
It looks like wipe out to me.

02:38:06.200 --> 02:38:07.200
Super fast.

02:38:07.200 --> 02:38:11.600
Well, wipe out's kind of like F zero in a way.

02:38:11.600 --> 02:38:12.600
Yeah.

02:38:12.600 --> 02:38:15.160
It's, it's all the same type of stuff, but I mean the vehicle design looks like wipe

02:38:15.160 --> 02:38:16.160
out.

02:38:16.160 --> 02:38:17.160
You know what though?

02:38:17.160 --> 02:38:20.320
They need to be able to play that perfectly as a negcon.

02:38:20.320 --> 02:38:21.320
Seriously.

02:38:21.320 --> 02:38:24.200
Nothing is like playing wipe out with a negcon.

02:38:24.200 --> 02:38:25.200
There you go.

02:38:25.200 --> 02:38:30.440
All right, we're going to go to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on

02:38:30.440 --> 02:38:32.080
Skype is orange lounge radio.

02:38:32.080 --> 02:38:35.280
You can go ahead and give us a call and we'll be taking your calls.

02:38:35.280 --> 02:38:38.520
Usually this is the part of the show where I would go to last minute stories, but, um,

02:38:38.520 --> 02:38:42.240
we actually are tabling those tonight because we still have more stories coming up during

02:38:42.240 --> 02:38:43.240
the marathon.

02:38:43.240 --> 02:38:47.240
Everything that was bumped tonight is coming up later during our marathon, so we'll get

02:38:47.240 --> 02:38:50.480
into that unless there's any late breaking news from this morning.

02:38:50.480 --> 02:38:52.520
I don't know if Loki has anything he wants to share from that.

02:38:52.520 --> 02:38:57.360
I guess we could do that, but otherwise we're just waiting for the calls to come in at 1-877-GAME-OLR

02:38:57.360 --> 02:39:02.280
or our username on Skype is orange lounge radio and we'll be taking your calls.

02:39:02.280 --> 02:39:07.120
This is probably not the first time tonight that the Skype line will be open, uh, but

02:39:07.120 --> 02:39:08.120
it's open right now.

02:39:08.120 --> 02:39:09.120
So there you go.

02:39:09.120 --> 02:39:12.920
The Borderlands level caps going up from 61 to 69.

02:39:12.920 --> 02:39:14.040
Nice for free.

02:39:14.040 --> 02:39:15.520
Why isn't Borderlands an MMO?

02:39:15.520 --> 02:39:22.360
Usually when I hear about level caps going up, I go, Oh, it's like an MMO, uh, although

02:39:22.360 --> 02:39:25.120
Borderlands kind of plays like a Warcraft type game, doesn't it?

02:39:25.120 --> 02:39:28.080
Except it's like first person, but like, doesn't it have like the whole like exclamation marks

02:39:28.080 --> 02:39:29.800
over people's heads and all that stuff.

02:39:29.800 --> 02:39:35.120
And you've, you've played this game a little bit, right on your Borderlands is pretty much

02:39:35.120 --> 02:39:38.160
like Diablo of Diablo was a first person shooter.

02:39:38.160 --> 02:39:41.720
You know, you shoot someone and the number of how much damage you do and hit points appears

02:39:41.720 --> 02:39:42.720
over their head.

02:39:42.720 --> 02:39:48.760
A loot is random, so you've got to go through all the loot that you get and drop the trash.

02:39:48.760 --> 02:39:49.760
It is pretty fun.

02:39:49.760 --> 02:39:50.760
Yeah.

02:39:50.760 --> 02:39:55.680
I was really glad to hear that I gearbox makers of Borderlands got the Duke Nukem forever

02:39:55.680 --> 02:39:59.240
contract because I'm a huge fan of theirs because they're the ones.

02:39:59.240 --> 02:40:00.240
See?

02:40:00.240 --> 02:40:01.240
Yeah.

02:40:01.240 --> 02:40:02.240
I forgot that they made Borderlands.

02:40:02.240 --> 02:40:03.240
Oh, well.

02:40:03.240 --> 02:40:06.480
Borderlands or a Duke Nukem forever is going to be fucking awesome then.

02:40:06.480 --> 02:40:07.480
Yeah.

02:40:07.480 --> 02:40:14.040
Cause they did the half-life blue shift and half-life, um, the one with the Marine, the,

02:40:14.040 --> 02:40:17.600
for the, the other expansion I'm blanking right now, I'm a huge half-life Stan.

02:40:17.600 --> 02:40:21.600
So anything that gearbox does, cause they're sort of a part of the valve family, I'm going

02:40:21.600 --> 02:40:25.240
to be all for.

02:40:25.240 --> 02:40:26.800
Whereas I don't think I've played a lot of their games.

02:40:26.800 --> 02:40:27.800
I'm not sure.

02:40:27.800 --> 02:40:28.800
All right, we're getting some calls.

02:40:28.800 --> 02:40:30.280
We're going to go to the Skype line and see what's up.

02:40:30.280 --> 02:40:31.440
Hi, you're on orange launch radio.

02:40:31.440 --> 02:40:32.440
Who's this?

02:40:32.440 --> 02:40:33.440
Hey, it's Ron.

02:40:33.440 --> 02:40:35.560
I just want to know, is it happy hour yet?

02:40:35.560 --> 02:40:36.560
Not yet.

02:40:36.560 --> 02:40:37.560
I'm still waiting for my drink.

02:40:37.560 --> 02:40:40.720
I'm supposed to get an hour and a half ago, but that's okay.

02:40:40.720 --> 02:40:41.720
It's all good.

02:40:41.720 --> 02:40:42.720
You're still waiting?

02:40:42.720 --> 02:40:43.720
I already started.

02:40:43.720 --> 02:40:44.720
Did you?

02:40:44.720 --> 02:40:45.720
What's the drink of choice for you right now, Rama?

02:40:45.720 --> 02:40:48.280
It says I have to grill tomorrow.

02:40:48.280 --> 02:40:50.760
I've been doing nothing but rum and Pepsi all night.

02:40:50.760 --> 02:40:52.080
So you have to grill tomorrow?

02:40:52.080 --> 02:40:53.080
What is that?

02:40:53.080 --> 02:40:54.080
I, I didn't know you were a chef.

02:40:54.080 --> 02:40:57.400
I thought you worked at like a retail store.

02:40:57.400 --> 02:41:00.880
I haven't worked retail in about three, four months.

02:41:00.880 --> 02:41:02.200
You're at a restaurant now?

02:41:02.200 --> 02:41:04.280
No, I'm talking about tomorrow.

02:41:04.280 --> 02:41:05.840
I'm breaking out my grill.

02:41:05.840 --> 02:41:07.440
Oh, Labor Day barbecue.

02:41:07.440 --> 02:41:08.440
I get it.

02:41:08.440 --> 02:41:09.440
Yes.

02:41:09.440 --> 02:41:10.440
I'm just, I'm just slow.

02:41:10.440 --> 02:41:11.440
Hi, Dan.

02:41:11.440 --> 02:41:12.440
Oh, Dan just walked into studio.

02:41:12.440 --> 02:41:13.440
How you doing, Dan?

02:41:13.440 --> 02:41:14.440
Oh, Lord.

02:41:14.440 --> 02:41:15.440
I'm doing good.

02:41:15.440 --> 02:41:16.440
Good.

02:41:16.440 --> 02:41:17.560
Are you going to be joining us for more of the marathon later on this evening as we move

02:41:17.560 --> 02:41:19.160
on and take over your house for a night?

02:41:19.160 --> 02:41:21.560
I don't think I have much of a choice.

02:41:21.560 --> 02:41:22.560
Awesome.

02:41:22.560 --> 02:41:23.560
Sounds great.

02:41:23.560 --> 02:41:24.560
Yes.

02:41:24.560 --> 02:41:25.560
All right.

02:41:25.560 --> 02:41:27.360
So what types of games should we play a little bit during the marathon tonight?

02:41:27.360 --> 02:41:28.840
At some point, I think we're going to move into the vault.

02:41:28.840 --> 02:41:29.840
I don't know.

02:41:29.840 --> 02:41:30.840
We're out in the living room.

02:41:30.840 --> 02:41:31.840
I don't know what dark soccer has.

02:41:31.840 --> 02:41:33.120
I told Dan to hook up Saturn for me.

02:41:33.120 --> 02:41:34.120
All right.

02:41:34.120 --> 02:41:35.120
The Saturn's hooked up.

02:41:35.120 --> 02:41:36.120
Woo.

02:41:36.120 --> 02:41:37.360
It's in the vault.

02:41:37.360 --> 02:41:38.360
What are you going to play on the Saturn?

02:41:38.360 --> 02:41:39.360
Big TV.

02:41:39.360 --> 02:41:40.360
All right.

02:41:40.360 --> 02:41:41.360
Anyhow.

02:41:41.360 --> 02:41:42.360
I'm playing Xbox on the big TV.

02:41:42.360 --> 02:41:43.360
All right.

02:41:43.360 --> 02:41:44.360
I got to get back to the call.

02:41:44.360 --> 02:41:45.360
We'll talk more of Dan later.

02:41:45.360 --> 02:41:46.360
Yes.

02:41:46.360 --> 02:41:47.360
Stay back.

02:41:47.360 --> 02:41:48.360
All right.

02:41:48.360 --> 02:41:49.360
Yes.

02:41:49.360 --> 02:41:50.360
Sounds good.

02:41:50.360 --> 02:41:54.360
Boy, last week's show was interesting.

02:41:54.360 --> 02:41:55.360
Anyhow.

02:41:55.360 --> 02:41:57.280
So what, what's interesting?

02:41:57.280 --> 02:42:01.640
What's on your mind today, Rama, besides the whole happy hour?

02:42:01.640 --> 02:42:04.440
I'm actually a little bit pissed at some of the people today.

02:42:04.440 --> 02:42:08.960
I'm really pissed at people that are bitching about the $10 price increase on Xbox Live.

02:42:08.960 --> 02:42:11.760
Why are you mad at them?

02:42:11.760 --> 02:42:15.240
You're only paying $60 a year for this.

02:42:15.240 --> 02:42:18.320
I understand why the price is going up.

02:42:18.320 --> 02:42:22.520
Microsoft is actually putting the money into the infrastructure for improvements.

02:42:22.520 --> 02:42:26.080
In order to make those improvements, something has to go up.

02:42:26.080 --> 02:42:30.200
Unlike these other software companies who are trying to jack extra money out of us because

02:42:30.200 --> 02:42:34.920
of used games, they can kiss my ass for all I care, but that's besides the point.

02:42:34.920 --> 02:42:35.920
Yeah.

02:42:35.920 --> 02:42:41.000
I was going to say, you know, I'm, I, it feels like we're getting nickeled and dimed in every

02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:42.160
possible place here.

02:42:42.160 --> 02:42:46.300
And it's like, I'm okay with Microsoft raising the price because they haven't in so long

02:42:46.300 --> 02:42:48.640
and they've been supporting it fairly decently.

02:42:48.640 --> 02:42:51.880
But then when I hear this online pass stuff is being allowed too, I get irritated.

02:42:51.880 --> 02:42:54.320
You know what I mean?

02:42:54.320 --> 02:42:55.320
Exactly.

02:42:55.320 --> 02:43:01.280
And if people are complaining about it, like you said, buy the cards now or do what I do,

02:43:01.280 --> 02:43:02.860
join reward zone.

02:43:02.860 --> 02:43:04.080
They have a gamers club.

02:43:04.080 --> 02:43:06.360
You buy games, you get points.

02:43:06.360 --> 02:43:10.000
When you hit 150 bucks, you get a $10 gift card.

02:43:10.000 --> 02:43:12.160
Use that toward your, your, your live.

02:43:12.160 --> 02:43:14.640
You save 10 bucks that way.

02:43:14.640 --> 02:43:18.680
So try to find different ways to exploit reward systems and point cards and all that good

02:43:18.680 --> 02:43:19.680
stuff, right?

02:43:19.680 --> 02:43:20.680
Yeah, exactly.

02:43:20.680 --> 02:43:23.520
Plus, Microsoft does do a buck a month deals.

02:43:23.520 --> 02:43:24.520
Those have popped up.

02:43:24.520 --> 02:43:25.520
Oh, that's true.

02:43:25.520 --> 02:43:26.520
Huh?

02:43:26.520 --> 02:43:27.520
I think I've seen those.

02:43:27.520 --> 02:43:28.520
Yeah.

02:43:28.520 --> 02:43:33.800
I saw it pop up on my dashboard on April fool's and I tweeted about everyone thought I was

02:43:33.800 --> 02:43:34.800
lying about.

02:43:34.800 --> 02:43:36.200
I'm like, no, this is legit.

02:43:36.200 --> 02:43:38.000
Here's a screen cap.

02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:40.060
Interesting question from Derek H in our chat room.

02:43:40.060 --> 02:43:43.180
What are the odds that when reach comes out, there will be problems connecting because

02:43:43.180 --> 02:43:45.680
Xbox live is overloaded.

02:43:45.680 --> 02:43:48.800
Then we'll see just how good their infrastructure is, right?

02:43:48.800 --> 02:43:53.480
I haven't seen it go down yet, you know, so I don't think there will be much of an issue.

02:43:53.480 --> 02:43:55.360
I'm trying to think if it ever has gone down.

02:43:55.360 --> 02:43:58.400
Has Xbox live ever gone down in a non pre-planned way?

02:43:58.400 --> 02:43:59.720
I'm sure it has for a little bit.

02:43:59.720 --> 02:44:00.720
Yeah.

02:44:00.720 --> 02:44:01.720
There was a few times.

02:44:01.720 --> 02:44:02.720
Never like anything too Epic.

02:44:02.720 --> 02:44:03.720
Right.

02:44:03.720 --> 02:44:04.960
It was always a weird times too.

02:44:04.960 --> 02:44:05.960
Wasn't it?

02:44:05.960 --> 02:44:07.200
It was like around new years or something.

02:44:07.200 --> 02:44:10.080
I think this year it was having issues.

02:44:10.080 --> 02:44:11.440
I will be interested to see though.

02:44:11.440 --> 02:44:17.160
I mean, he, Derek has a point if, if it goes down, then this whole fact that they're, you

02:44:17.160 --> 02:44:20.720
know, charging the extra money to improve their infrastructure is kind of a line, isn't

02:44:20.720 --> 02:44:21.720
it?

02:44:21.720 --> 02:44:22.720
Well, yeah.

02:44:22.720 --> 02:44:27.600
It's not because, um, you're really not going to be adding too many people to the actual

02:44:27.600 --> 02:44:28.600
live service.

02:44:28.600 --> 02:44:30.400
You're just going to have people playing a different game.

02:44:30.400 --> 02:44:33.280
And Derek says it happened with Halo three and Halo two.

02:44:33.280 --> 02:44:38.760
I don't remember it happening with Halo three, but then again, not to like sound beat sound

02:44:38.760 --> 02:44:42.600
like that guy, but I had it a couple of days early, so I was playing it a little bit earlier.

02:44:42.600 --> 02:44:47.240
So maybe I didn't notice it, but sometimes they try to do outages in advance to plan

02:44:47.240 --> 02:44:48.240
for this stuff.

02:44:48.240 --> 02:44:49.240
But yeah.

02:44:49.240 --> 02:44:52.920
And I do remember a couple of times Major Nelson said, there's been issues with live

02:44:52.920 --> 02:44:55.680
and within an hour or two, everything is back to normal.

02:44:55.680 --> 02:44:57.680
So, you know,

02:44:57.680 --> 02:45:01.960
Cause they know they're going to have to get hell, uh, with all these people paying for

02:45:01.960 --> 02:45:07.680
it, which, you know, uh, whereas the PlayStation, uh, if you know, stuff goes down for them

02:45:07.680 --> 02:45:08.880
and it's free anyway.

02:45:08.880 --> 02:45:09.880
Right?

02:45:09.880 --> 02:45:10.880
Yeah.

02:45:10.880 --> 02:45:11.880
Yeah.

02:45:11.880 --> 02:45:15.360
Also there was, there was one time, a few times on like a, uh, one versus a hundred

02:45:15.360 --> 02:45:17.040
where they had problems with that.

02:45:17.040 --> 02:45:18.040
Oh really?

02:45:18.040 --> 02:45:19.040
Yeah.

02:45:19.040 --> 02:45:23.240
And it was kind of weird that was doing that because they had like a, like in their beta

02:45:23.240 --> 02:45:27.080
seasons had like 150,000 at one time and it was working fine probably back then.

02:45:27.080 --> 02:45:30.760
But it was like 50,000 that it was coming in for a time and it didn't work for like

02:45:30.760 --> 02:45:31.760
two weeks.

02:45:31.760 --> 02:45:32.760
Interesting.

02:45:32.760 --> 02:45:33.760
I don't remember that.

02:45:33.760 --> 02:45:35.860
But then again, I was kind of one of those people that played it more when it first came

02:45:35.860 --> 02:45:39.080
out and then like later on I was like, oh, it'll always be here.

02:45:39.080 --> 02:45:40.080
I'll just play it next time.

02:45:40.080 --> 02:45:41.560
And then, oh, now it's gone.

02:45:41.560 --> 02:45:42.560
No more of that.

02:45:42.560 --> 02:45:43.560
Yeah.

02:45:43.560 --> 02:45:44.560
Forget that.

02:45:44.560 --> 02:45:48.640
That's one thing I would hope with this extra $10 is they'd add something that's like that

02:45:48.640 --> 02:45:49.880
to replace it.

02:45:49.880 --> 02:45:54.320
That is a damn good point is that, you know, they took away one versus a hundred and you

02:45:54.320 --> 02:45:57.240
know, they're going to be charging more for Xbox live.

02:45:57.240 --> 02:46:00.680
Like if they brought something awesome like that back, like more of these interactive

02:46:00.680 --> 02:46:03.520
live shows, I charged me 20 more.

02:46:03.520 --> 02:46:06.120
Well, you know what I think would be a benefit.

02:46:06.120 --> 02:46:07.120
Huh?

02:46:07.120 --> 02:46:11.560
I'm going to take that thing and shove it up your butt.

02:46:11.560 --> 02:46:15.000
Come on.

02:46:15.000 --> 02:46:18.360
I figured we had to have at least once during the marathon.

02:46:18.360 --> 02:46:19.360
You know what?

02:46:19.360 --> 02:46:20.560
Oh, what?

02:46:20.560 --> 02:46:25.600
I've decided that I am so sick of dark Sakura always having her stupid vuvuzilla button

02:46:25.600 --> 02:46:30.680
here on the program that what I've decided to do is that I've actually, um, decided to

02:46:30.680 --> 02:46:40.720
counter dark Sakura a little bit here and uh, I actually have my stadium vuvuzilla noise.

02:46:40.720 --> 02:46:41.720
You are such a dork.

02:46:41.720 --> 02:46:45.520
So we can have dueling vuvuzillas on the show.

02:46:45.520 --> 02:46:46.520
That's going to be amazing.

02:46:46.520 --> 02:46:47.520
We'll duet Rob.

02:46:47.520 --> 02:46:48.520
Great.

02:46:48.520 --> 02:46:49.520
I'm sure the listeners are so excited.

02:46:49.520 --> 02:46:53.520
Well, I am glad they do look for it.

02:46:53.520 --> 02:46:56.520
It's a band, that thing.

02:46:56.520 --> 02:46:58.520
Turn off.

02:46:58.520 --> 02:47:00.520
There we go.

02:47:00.520 --> 02:47:01.520
All right.

02:47:01.520 --> 02:47:02.520
It won't shut up.

02:47:02.520 --> 02:47:03.520
All right.

02:47:03.520 --> 02:47:04.520
Rama, anything else you want to share with us for now?

02:47:04.520 --> 02:47:08.000
I'm sure you'll call in later, but you know, well, if you want, I have another story.

02:47:08.000 --> 02:47:11.480
I can say that when I called back later, actually, we're supposed to be doing an outbound call

02:47:11.480 --> 02:47:12.480
right now.

02:47:12.480 --> 02:47:15.840
So, um, I'm going to let you go for now, but call in later and give us that story because

02:47:15.840 --> 02:47:19.480
we do still have more stories too that we're going to talk about a little later.

02:47:19.480 --> 02:47:20.480
Wonderful.

02:47:20.480 --> 02:47:21.480
Great.

02:47:21.480 --> 02:47:22.480
All right.

02:47:22.480 --> 02:47:23.480
Talk to you later.

02:47:23.480 --> 02:47:24.480
Be more drunk.

02:47:24.480 --> 02:47:25.480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:47:25.480 --> 02:47:26.480
Bye bye.

02:47:26.480 --> 02:47:27.480
Bye.

02:47:27.480 --> 02:47:28.480
All right.

02:47:28.480 --> 02:47:29.480
We're going to hold off on calls for a minute because we're actually going to make an outbound

02:47:29.480 --> 02:47:30.480
call.

02:47:30.480 --> 02:47:36.200
It is now five o'clock Pacific and yeah, we're three hours in and usually at this time there's

02:47:36.200 --> 02:47:40.400
another man live at All Games Radio and some people might be tuning in to try and hear

02:47:40.400 --> 02:47:42.200
him, but you can't.

02:47:42.200 --> 02:47:43.200
He's not live tonight.

02:47:43.200 --> 02:47:49.080
The man is Bobby Black Wolf, the host of the Bobby Black Wolf show here on All Games Radio

02:47:49.080 --> 02:47:53.280
and he's not live tonight cause he's at Dragon Con this weekend.

02:47:53.280 --> 02:47:57.480
So sorry fans of Bobby who don't listen to us.

02:47:57.480 --> 02:48:00.720
Uh, you don't get Bobby tonight or do you?

02:48:00.720 --> 02:48:04.160
We're going to call him right now actually and try to get him on the show so he can have

02:48:04.160 --> 02:48:06.120
a mini Bobby Black Wolf show.

02:48:06.120 --> 02:48:11.120
So two ringy dingys.

02:48:11.120 --> 02:48:14.840
Hey Bobby, how are you doing?

02:48:14.840 --> 02:48:16.800
It's your buddy Rob from Orange Launch Radio.

02:48:16.800 --> 02:48:18.400
Hey, I'm doing great.

02:48:18.400 --> 02:48:20.720
How are, how are you guys holding up?

02:48:20.720 --> 02:48:21.720
That's what?

02:48:21.720 --> 02:48:22.720
Hour three?

02:48:22.720 --> 02:48:23.720
Good.

02:48:23.720 --> 02:48:24.720
Yes.

02:48:24.720 --> 02:48:25.720
We're in hour three.

02:48:25.720 --> 02:48:28.560
We got started a little bit late cause weird server problems at All Games and I know Scott's

02:48:28.560 --> 02:48:31.880
at Burning Man and all these other things are going on, but it just magically started

02:48:31.880 --> 02:48:33.120
working at two.

02:48:33.120 --> 02:48:36.760
So I'm not sure if somebody must have put it on a schedule or something and we tried

02:48:36.760 --> 02:48:37.760
to take it.

02:48:37.760 --> 02:48:39.320
It's on a schedule.

02:48:39.320 --> 02:48:40.640
It may cut you off later.

02:48:40.640 --> 02:48:41.640
I don't know.

02:48:41.640 --> 02:48:42.640
Oh, great.

02:48:42.640 --> 02:48:43.640
Just what we needed.

02:48:43.640 --> 02:48:44.640
Yeah.

02:48:44.640 --> 02:48:46.720
Who knows how long the marathon will be going tonight.

02:48:46.720 --> 02:48:50.400
It'll when All Games Radio decides to cut it off, we'll be done I guess.

02:48:50.400 --> 02:48:51.400
We'll see what happens.

02:48:51.400 --> 02:48:52.400
All right.

02:48:52.400 --> 02:48:53.400
Right.

02:48:53.400 --> 02:48:54.400
Try to tweet channel Z.

02:48:54.400 --> 02:48:55.400
All right.

02:48:55.400 --> 02:48:56.400
We'll see.

02:48:56.400 --> 02:48:57.400
All right.

02:48:57.400 --> 02:49:00.640
Well, I figured, you know, since you're not able to do a show here live at All Games Radio

02:49:00.640 --> 02:49:05.080
cause A you're gone and B we took over, I thought maybe you'd want to do the mini Bobby

02:49:05.080 --> 02:49:06.080
Black Wolf show.

02:49:06.080 --> 02:49:07.080
Sure.

02:49:07.080 --> 02:49:10.840
I mean, I, well then I can talk about what's been going on here at Dragon Con and some

02:49:10.840 --> 02:49:14.600
of the neat stuff that I've done and something that we're actually going to be running next

02:49:14.600 --> 02:49:18.880
week, which I didn't even know.

02:49:18.880 --> 02:49:19.880
Hold on.

02:49:19.880 --> 02:49:20.880
This is very important.

02:49:20.880 --> 02:49:21.880
Breaking news here at the OLR marathon.

02:49:21.880 --> 02:49:23.600
I believe I've been given a glass of liquor.

02:49:23.600 --> 02:49:24.600
What is this?

02:49:24.600 --> 02:49:25.600
This is my first booze of the evening.

02:49:25.600 --> 02:49:26.600
What is this?

02:49:26.600 --> 02:49:30.760
It's a double shot of tequila and, uh, um, it better be Patron.

02:49:30.760 --> 02:49:31.760
It is.

02:49:31.760 --> 02:49:32.760
Okay.

02:49:32.760 --> 02:49:33.760
Okay.

02:49:33.760 --> 02:49:34.760
Okay.

02:49:34.760 --> 02:49:35.760
Good.

02:49:35.760 --> 02:49:36.760
Good.

02:49:36.760 --> 02:49:40.600
And it's a pea grapefruit juice.

02:49:40.600 --> 02:49:41.600
That's a tasty beverage.

02:49:41.600 --> 02:49:42.600
All right.

02:49:42.600 --> 02:49:43.600
I'm making more.

02:49:43.600 --> 02:49:44.600
Who wants one?

02:49:44.600 --> 02:49:45.600
Sorry, Bobby.

02:49:45.600 --> 02:49:46.600
I just, um,

02:49:46.600 --> 02:49:47.600
Oh, there's beverages here.

02:49:47.600 --> 02:49:48.600
Don't worry.

02:49:48.600 --> 02:49:49.600
I don't feel left out.

02:49:49.600 --> 02:49:50.600
Yeah.

02:49:50.600 --> 02:49:53.800
I was going to say you, you sound like you're either kind of tired or maybe, maybe you've

02:49:53.800 --> 02:49:55.320
had a beverage or two yourself.

02:49:55.320 --> 02:49:56.320
I don't know.

02:49:56.320 --> 02:49:57.320
Have you, have you?

02:49:57.320 --> 02:49:58.800
I actually haven't had a beverage today.

02:49:58.800 --> 02:50:04.280
I found a quiet place kind of to be, and then I realized the quiet place is right next to

02:50:04.280 --> 02:50:06.880
security operations for the hotel.

02:50:06.880 --> 02:50:09.160
So I'm kind of trying to keep it down a little bit.

02:50:09.160 --> 02:50:10.160
Ah, I see.

02:50:10.160 --> 02:50:11.160
Okay.

02:50:11.160 --> 02:50:12.160
All right.

02:50:12.160 --> 02:50:13.160
Well, what's Dragon, what's going on at Dragon Con?

02:50:13.160 --> 02:50:15.560
I know you want to tell us a little bit about what's going on over there at the show and

02:50:15.560 --> 02:50:18.040
some of the stuff you got for your own show next week.

02:50:18.040 --> 02:50:23.400
Well, basically, I mean, Dragon Con, it's, it's a big, it's, you know, it's, take Comic

02:50:23.400 --> 02:50:26.200
Con and take out really a lot of like the industry stuff.

02:50:26.200 --> 02:50:28.200
This is a fan convention.

02:50:28.200 --> 02:50:30.120
There are a lot of celebrities here.

02:50:30.120 --> 02:50:33.480
Um, I haven't stood in line for any of those panels or anything.

02:50:33.480 --> 02:50:37.040
I've actually been here trying, you know, staying away from video games, staying away

02:50:37.040 --> 02:50:38.360
from computers.

02:50:38.360 --> 02:50:42.560
The game I actually been playing most recently, I don't know if you've ever played this game.

02:50:42.560 --> 02:50:46.560
It's a, it's a card slash role playing game called are you a werewolf?

02:50:46.560 --> 02:50:47.840
Have you ever played that?

02:50:47.840 --> 02:50:49.560
No, but it sounds interesting.

02:50:49.560 --> 02:50:53.040
Loki, are you a werewolf?

02:50:53.040 --> 02:50:54.040
It goes by another name.

02:50:54.040 --> 02:50:55.040
Some people know it as mafia.

02:50:55.040 --> 02:50:56.040
It's the same rules.

02:50:56.040 --> 02:50:59.120
Oh God, we, I have played a game like this.

02:50:59.120 --> 02:51:02.160
It's um, no, when I played it, it was just called werewolf.

02:51:02.160 --> 02:51:03.840
It's a very popular foreign game, right?

02:51:03.840 --> 02:51:07.120
It's the thing where, um, like you have a group of 12 people, right?

02:51:07.120 --> 02:51:12.160
And like three of them are wolves and like every night the, everybody votes to lynch

02:51:12.160 --> 02:51:13.700
one person.

02:51:13.700 --> 02:51:16.200
And if the wolves are the last people standing, they win.

02:51:16.200 --> 02:51:18.200
But if the, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, they win.

02:51:18.200 --> 02:51:19.200
Yes.

02:51:19.200 --> 02:51:23.920
I've, I've, I've said this game play before, that's from 2am to 9am.

02:51:23.920 --> 02:51:24.920
Okay.

02:51:24.920 --> 02:51:28.800
And then I, and then I sleep a little bit and about one o'clock I get up and go to the

02:51:28.800 --> 02:51:30.680
dealer's room and stuff like that.

02:51:30.680 --> 02:51:33.720
Uh, so that's really what I've been doing is staying away from video games.

02:51:33.720 --> 02:51:35.680
There is a video game room here.

02:51:35.680 --> 02:51:41.120
They do have consoles here that people can check out games, use games from the game store

02:51:41.120 --> 02:51:42.480
that's running it from Tennessee.

02:51:42.480 --> 02:51:46.320
Um, but really it's not really the focus of DragonCon.

02:51:46.320 --> 02:51:52.240
There are no game companies exhibiting here, so it's, there's not that much video game

02:51:52.240 --> 02:51:54.560
type stuff going on here.

02:51:54.560 --> 02:51:57.240
However, and this is the cool thing.

02:51:57.240 --> 02:52:00.160
I just got an interview, which we're going to run on my show next week, which by the

02:52:00.160 --> 02:52:01.920
way guys is 25 minutes long.

02:52:01.920 --> 02:52:02.920
Woohoo.

02:52:02.920 --> 02:52:07.960
Do you remember, did you ever remember in Dave and Buster, the BattleTech centers?

02:52:07.960 --> 02:52:08.960
Absolutely.

02:52:08.960 --> 02:52:14.160
Dan absolutely loved that thing and he was pissed when it was taken out.

02:52:14.160 --> 02:52:19.520
I have the entire story on why it was taken out and where all those pods went because

02:52:19.520 --> 02:52:25.560
there are eight BattleTech pods downstairs, 24 hours right here at DragonCon.

02:52:25.560 --> 02:52:26.840
Oh wow.

02:52:26.840 --> 02:52:27.840
That's awesome.

02:52:27.840 --> 02:52:29.640
And they are still making updates.

02:52:29.640 --> 02:52:33.040
The game actually looks a lot like MechWarrior 4 on the PC now.

02:52:33.040 --> 02:52:35.920
They're actually, the software company is still working on new updates.

02:52:35.920 --> 02:52:39.520
They're going to bring back Red Planet very soon as well.

02:52:39.520 --> 02:52:44.720
You know, um, and uh, I got the story of, you know, where they travel and uh, you know,

02:52:44.720 --> 02:52:49.440
because basically Enthusiast bought all the pods after Dave and Busters canceled the contract.

02:52:49.440 --> 02:52:53.960
And the short story is Dave and Busters decided that they no longer wanted to have anybody

02:52:53.960 --> 02:52:55.280
working the Midway.

02:52:55.280 --> 02:52:57.040
Everything had to be self-sustaining.

02:52:57.040 --> 02:53:01.360
And so the BattleTech, they decided did not renew the contract with Virtual World.

02:53:01.360 --> 02:53:05.520
So they were going to sell all the pods and all these Enthusiasts came together and said,

02:53:05.520 --> 02:53:07.720
we'll buy this set and this set.

02:53:07.720 --> 02:53:11.240
And now all the sets are all over the country and some of them are mobile now.

02:53:11.240 --> 02:53:12.240
Wow.

02:53:12.240 --> 02:53:13.240
Huh.

02:53:13.240 --> 02:53:20.200
And I, so I have a 25 minute interview with an owner of one of a set of 16 pods, eight

02:53:20.200 --> 02:53:23.320
of which are traveling, eight of which are in a center in Houston.

02:53:23.320 --> 02:53:28.160
Uh, and we talk about, you know, what, because he was just a player and they got the funds

02:53:28.160 --> 02:53:29.160
together to buy it.

02:53:29.160 --> 02:53:34.000
And they traveled the country with these pods and they do maintenance on the hardware and

02:53:34.000 --> 02:53:37.520
they do the community thing and do the whole BattleTech Center stuff.

02:53:37.520 --> 02:53:40.200
But they're keeping the BattleTech dream alive.

02:53:40.200 --> 02:53:44.080
And we're going to have a long, nice, very good interview with him next week on the Bobby

02:53:44.080 --> 02:53:45.080
Block World Show.

02:53:45.080 --> 02:53:46.940
I'm excited to hear it.

02:53:46.940 --> 02:53:51.320
When I was living in Walnut Creek, we had a Virtual World, one of the few that were

02:53:51.320 --> 02:53:55.800
in California and I used to play a BattleTech in those pods.

02:53:55.800 --> 02:53:57.560
It's a great time.

02:53:57.560 --> 02:53:58.780
That made me super motion sick.

02:53:58.780 --> 02:54:02.280
The one time I tried, I remember playing the Dave and Buster's, I got my butt kicked by

02:54:02.280 --> 02:54:03.280
Dan, but it was fun.

02:54:03.280 --> 02:54:05.440
I played that that time too.

02:54:05.440 --> 02:54:08.520
We were there for one of my birthdays and I was super drunk, but I was really motion

02:54:08.520 --> 02:54:09.680
sick anyway.

02:54:09.680 --> 02:54:13.600
But that new Dave and Buster's in Roseville, like if they try to put a BattleTech center

02:54:13.600 --> 02:54:15.640
there, that would just be the entire place.

02:54:15.640 --> 02:54:16.640
It would.

02:54:16.640 --> 02:54:17.640
It's that small.

02:54:17.640 --> 02:54:18.640
It's Dave and Buster's Jr.

02:54:18.640 --> 02:54:20.680
Well, that's going to be an awesome interview, Bobby.

02:54:20.680 --> 02:54:22.440
We're looking forward to that next week.

02:54:22.440 --> 02:54:24.120
What else is going on at Dragon Con?

02:54:24.120 --> 02:54:26.560
Did you end up on a panel after all, I heard?

02:54:26.560 --> 02:54:27.560
What's this?

02:54:27.560 --> 02:54:28.560
I did.

02:54:28.560 --> 02:54:33.400
The panel they had put me on was the kickoff panel, which was Friday at one o'clock and

02:54:33.400 --> 02:54:36.720
I actually had to work until noon.

02:54:36.720 --> 02:54:40.920
I was all packed and everything and I had left at noon to get down here and the trains

02:54:40.920 --> 02:54:44.200
were held up a little bit.

02:54:44.200 --> 02:54:49.520
I actually walked into the back of the panel at 1.15 and the place is packed.

02:54:49.520 --> 02:54:52.640
They do call me up at about 1.15, 1.20.

02:54:52.640 --> 02:54:57.080
I haven't even gotten my badge yet because the badge line is five hours long for pre-registration.

02:54:57.080 --> 02:55:02.120
That's the one thing Dragon Con hasn't figured out is how to pick up your badge.

02:55:02.120 --> 02:55:06.240
I went up, did the panel, did the last 30 minutes of the panel.

02:55:06.240 --> 02:55:07.240
The room was packed.

02:55:07.240 --> 02:55:09.440
Would you like to know why the room was packed, Rob?

02:55:09.440 --> 02:55:10.440
Why?

02:55:10.440 --> 02:55:11.440
It wasn't for me.

02:55:11.440 --> 02:55:16.560
This is the key, if you ever want to have a packed panel, have Veronica Belmont on it

02:55:16.560 --> 02:55:18.560
with you.

02:55:18.560 --> 02:55:19.680
Nice.

02:55:19.680 --> 02:55:20.680
She was there, huh?

02:55:20.680 --> 02:55:25.160
No, because she was there with the Swords and Lasers podcast is kind of the one.

02:55:25.160 --> 02:55:26.400
That's her independent podcast.

02:55:26.400 --> 02:55:27.400
They're here.

02:55:27.400 --> 02:55:33.640
They actually did a live show in a large ballroom today at four here, but she was on the panel

02:55:33.640 --> 02:55:34.640
and stuff.

02:55:34.640 --> 02:55:40.800
I talked a little bit about what we do at all games and stuff like that, but yeah, the

02:55:40.800 --> 02:55:42.800
place was packed and it's because Veronica was there.

02:55:42.800 --> 02:55:46.400
When it was over, everybody was rushing to get their pictures with Veronica and all that

02:55:46.400 --> 02:55:47.400
stuff.

02:55:47.400 --> 02:55:49.880
I did get to speak on one panel, but that was it.

02:55:49.880 --> 02:55:53.880
My official obligations were gone in two and I didn't even have my badge yet at the time.

02:55:53.880 --> 02:55:57.800
One of the few podcasts that I will admit to listening to, because it is pretty good,

02:55:57.800 --> 02:56:01.320
is The Instance, which is one of the World of Warcraft podcasts that's out there.

02:56:01.320 --> 02:56:07.440
She was actually on, they recently had a big buku ye hippie hurrah 200th episode, and she

02:56:07.440 --> 02:56:09.000
was on that.

02:56:09.000 --> 02:56:12.360
I was kind of like, oh yeah, this is kind of interesting.

02:56:12.360 --> 02:56:13.360
Yeah.

02:56:13.360 --> 02:56:14.360
Well, cool.

02:56:14.360 --> 02:56:16.320
She does a lot of independent stuff.

02:56:16.320 --> 02:56:21.160
I mean, yeah, she's been hired by CNET, she works for CORE, but she still really loves

02:56:21.160 --> 02:56:23.920
doing all the independent stuff.

02:56:23.920 --> 02:56:24.920
She considers it a hobby.

02:56:24.920 --> 02:56:25.920
That's awesome.

02:56:25.920 --> 02:56:28.840
It's a good way to do it, good for her.

02:56:28.840 --> 02:56:33.840
What about, are there any other type of record-breaking things going on there, like no thriller dances

02:56:33.840 --> 02:56:35.760
this year, or what's going on?

02:56:35.760 --> 02:56:40.960
Well, they can't do Thriller because the Thriller record is currently 12,000.

02:56:40.960 --> 02:56:44.800
Mexico City set it to 12,000, so the 900, whatever they did here.

02:56:44.800 --> 02:56:48.360
I don't know how they did, I mean, obviously, we won't know how they did until Guinness

02:56:48.360 --> 02:56:55.400
verifies it, but they did two existing records, and they tried to set up a brand new record.

02:56:55.400 --> 02:56:59.480
The two existing, they wanted the most Star Trek characters in one place, and the most

02:56:59.480 --> 02:57:04.240
superheroes in one place, and then they created a new one of most theme punk characters in

02:57:04.240 --> 02:57:07.640
one place, because theme punk's really kind of the new goth.

02:57:07.640 --> 02:57:14.240
Here at DragonCon, everybody is theme punk, and ears, and all that stuff, so it used to

02:57:14.240 --> 02:57:17.280
be just Neil Victoria, and then they added all the technology to it.

02:57:17.280 --> 02:57:20.680
So those are the records that they've been trying to break.

02:57:20.680 --> 02:57:24.120
But I don't know exactly how those have been going.

02:57:24.120 --> 02:57:25.120
Sounds like fun, though.

02:57:25.120 --> 02:57:26.120
Good times.

02:57:26.120 --> 02:57:31.800
Now, I will say, I did go in the dealer's room, there is a dealer that actually had

02:57:31.800 --> 02:57:37.920
a lot of, going back to the video game thing, a lot of rare Nintendo games, Super Nintendo

02:57:37.920 --> 02:57:40.720
games, things like that.

02:57:40.720 --> 02:57:44.200
He actually had Earthbound for the NES.

02:57:44.200 --> 02:57:45.200
Oh wow.

02:57:45.200 --> 02:57:46.200
The cartridge.

02:57:46.200 --> 02:57:47.200
Oh wow.

02:57:47.200 --> 02:57:48.200
That's...

02:57:48.200 --> 02:57:52.760
He was selling it for $130, and I did not get it in time.

02:57:52.760 --> 02:57:55.840
I came back ready to get it, and somebody else had bought it.

02:57:55.840 --> 02:57:58.280
Oh, that's awful.

02:57:58.280 --> 02:58:03.600
But it was the actual limited edition NES release of Earthbound.

02:58:03.600 --> 02:58:10.480
He's got little Samsung, he's got an NES port test cartridge, so one of the test cartridges

02:58:10.480 --> 02:58:14.800
that the service centers had, and he's got that for $350, which is a lot more than it

02:58:14.800 --> 02:58:17.680
ever goes on eBay, but it's very, very rare.

02:58:17.680 --> 02:58:28.320
But I did buy something from him, Nintendo related, and it's not exactly rare, and once

02:58:28.320 --> 02:58:33.320
people see exactly what it is, it's not gonna sound as cool as it would when you first see

02:58:33.320 --> 02:58:35.920
it, but I'm gonna save that for Friday night on Friday Night Gaming.

02:58:35.920 --> 02:58:38.160
Oh, a little tease there, all right.

02:58:38.160 --> 02:58:43.800
So Friday Night Gaming, if you wanna check that out this Friday at fnglive.net, right?

02:58:43.800 --> 02:58:47.360
Yes, and the main game we'll be playing is Metroid Other M.

02:58:47.360 --> 02:58:48.360
Because it's effing live.

02:58:48.360 --> 02:58:52.360
But I'll be showing this game that I picked up here at DragonCon for a pretty penny, and

02:58:52.360 --> 02:58:55.480
I overpaid a little bit, as you can expect, for con prices and stuff.

02:58:55.480 --> 02:58:59.000
I looked online how much it is, and I could have gotten it online for a lot cheaper.

02:58:59.000 --> 02:59:02.200
I'll tell you where you can get it once we show it.

02:59:02.200 --> 02:59:11.480
But yeah, he had all the Mega Man, he had, I can't remember what Super Nintendo games,

02:59:11.480 --> 02:59:14.720
but he had Little Samson, I guess, is a really rare NES game.

02:59:14.720 --> 02:59:17.920
You get that in the box, sitting in there.

02:59:17.920 --> 02:59:23.000
So there's some rare stuff that I found in the dealer's room, and I just can't afford

02:59:23.000 --> 02:59:24.000
it all.

02:59:24.000 --> 02:59:26.360
We're actually looking at our chat room at chat.orangelandradiocom.

02:59:26.360 --> 02:59:27.680
I apologize to Bobby's fans.

02:59:27.680 --> 02:59:31.280
I kinda have one eye on the all games chat room, but I'm not able to follow.

02:59:31.280 --> 02:59:34.320
There's a lot of chatty chat going on there right now, but let's see.

02:59:34.320 --> 02:59:37.960
Breakman says, Earthbound for the NES and Bobby let him keep his life?

02:59:37.960 --> 02:59:39.960
He got lucky.

02:59:39.960 --> 02:59:45.080
Well, I bought this other thing first.

02:59:45.080 --> 02:59:49.440
It was my first priority, and then I came back and it was gone by the time I had come

02:59:49.440 --> 02:59:51.440
back the next day.

02:59:51.440 --> 02:59:54.000
That's too bad.

02:59:54.000 --> 02:59:57.920
You'll have to find the guy who bought it and end his life.

02:59:57.920 --> 02:59:58.920
No.

02:59:58.920 --> 03:00:04.480
All right, so if you're the guy that bought the Earthbound on the NES cartridge at Dragon

03:00:04.480 --> 03:00:06.120
Con, Bobby's looking for you.

03:00:06.120 --> 03:00:07.120
All right.

03:00:07.120 --> 03:00:08.120
That's right.

03:00:08.120 --> 03:00:09.120
I want Earthbound Zero sometime.

03:00:09.120 --> 03:00:10.120
All right.

03:00:10.120 --> 03:00:13.620
Well, Bobby, we don't want to keep you up for the convention too much longer, but anything

03:00:13.620 --> 03:00:19.440
else you want to say about the convention or your show or anything for the folks listening?

03:00:19.440 --> 03:00:20.440
Not really.

03:00:20.440 --> 03:00:22.360
I mean, Dragon Con, it's been a fun time.

03:00:22.360 --> 03:00:23.560
There's a lot of great costumes.

03:00:23.560 --> 03:00:26.400
I have not seen Brad from pot culture yet.

03:00:26.400 --> 03:00:27.400
I know he's here.

03:00:27.400 --> 03:00:31.120
He's out having dinner somewhere tonight, so I didn't get to...

03:00:31.120 --> 03:00:37.240
I haven't been able to say hi to him, but I mean, no, and here's the great thing, Rob.

03:00:37.240 --> 03:00:38.840
They moved PAX next year.

03:00:38.840 --> 03:00:39.840
Did you notice that?

03:00:39.840 --> 03:00:40.840
No.

03:00:40.840 --> 03:00:42.760
PAX got moved.

03:00:42.760 --> 03:00:44.760
I did not.

03:00:44.760 --> 03:00:46.480
It's back to its original weekend.

03:00:46.480 --> 03:00:49.280
It is the last weekend of August next year.

03:00:49.280 --> 03:00:51.160
It is not Labor Day weekend.

03:00:51.160 --> 03:00:52.160
It's the weekend before.

03:00:52.160 --> 03:00:53.160
Interesting.

03:00:53.160 --> 03:00:54.160
Flights are cheaper.

03:00:54.160 --> 03:00:55.160
That'll be good.

03:00:55.160 --> 03:00:56.160
Yeah.

03:00:56.160 --> 03:00:57.160
Flights will be cheaper.

03:00:57.160 --> 03:00:58.160
It's been a long time.

03:00:58.160 --> 03:00:59.160
I have to do that next year then.

03:00:59.160 --> 03:01:03.200
So I'll be able to make it out there and here, and I don't have to worry about which one

03:01:03.200 --> 03:01:06.880
I'm going to, so I was very happy about that.

03:01:06.880 --> 03:01:09.480
I've been trying to keep an eye on PAX news and stuff.

03:01:09.480 --> 03:01:12.840
I'll believe the Duke Nukem for everything when I see it.

03:01:12.840 --> 03:01:13.840
It's...

03:01:13.840 --> 03:01:15.080
They've got video from the show floor.

03:01:15.080 --> 03:01:16.080
It's nuts.

03:01:16.080 --> 03:01:17.080
I'm just...

03:01:17.080 --> 03:01:22.500
Then they can say, oh, by the way, yeah, it won't be coming out for another 10 years.

03:01:22.500 --> 03:01:26.320
But it's the guys who did Borderlands now, and as we were kind of discussing earlier

03:01:26.320 --> 03:01:29.840
when it was our lead story tonight, as you can probably imagine, we were kind of talking

03:01:29.840 --> 03:01:34.040
about how it's probably not really the same game 3D Realms was developing.

03:01:34.040 --> 03:01:40.120
It was just kind of like, okay, well, we've bought this IP from the slaughter of 3D Realms.

03:01:40.120 --> 03:01:43.700
Let's just take all these art assets and the idea and see what we can do with it, and now

03:01:43.700 --> 03:01:46.880
you actually have a game, because it's not the same game.

03:01:46.880 --> 03:01:47.880
Yeah.

03:01:47.880 --> 03:01:48.880
Let's see.

03:01:48.880 --> 03:01:49.880
Go ahead.

03:01:49.880 --> 03:01:55.000
One last thing is I wanted to do my show this week mainly because I wish I was doing it

03:01:55.000 --> 03:01:58.400
because Microsoft has been showing a hell of a lot of balls this week.

03:01:58.400 --> 03:01:59.400
How so?

03:01:59.400 --> 03:02:02.960
With the new controller and the Xbox Live.

03:02:02.960 --> 03:02:03.960
We have talked about...

03:02:03.960 --> 03:02:04.960
What was that?

03:02:04.960 --> 03:02:05.960
Yeah.

03:02:05.960 --> 03:02:06.960
So we have talked about some of that stuff.

03:02:06.960 --> 03:02:07.960
Yeah.

03:02:07.960 --> 03:02:11.360
The limited edition controller or the bundled or whatever controller and the price increases

03:02:11.360 --> 03:02:14.080
we were just talking about before we had you on.

03:02:14.080 --> 03:02:15.080
Yeah.

03:02:15.080 --> 03:02:16.080
Yeah.

03:02:16.080 --> 03:02:19.680
Microsoft is just showing a lot of balls this week, and I'm like, damn, they had to do this

03:02:19.680 --> 03:02:20.680
on the week.

03:02:20.680 --> 03:02:21.680
I'm not doing anything.

03:02:21.680 --> 03:02:24.720
Let me get some quick questions from our chat room at chat.org.com.

03:02:24.720 --> 03:02:28.600
G Ripper wants to know, is Glenn there, your partner in crime from FNG Live?

03:02:28.600 --> 03:02:29.600
No.

03:02:29.600 --> 03:02:31.280
He is not here.

03:02:31.280 --> 03:02:33.920
Nobody else from FNG was able to make it up here.

03:02:33.920 --> 03:02:38.580
Derek H asks, is it true that as Chris Gore said, Dragon Con is a sluttier version of

03:02:38.580 --> 03:02:39.580
Comic-Con?

03:02:39.580 --> 03:02:40.580
Probably.

03:02:40.580 --> 03:02:41.580
Yeah.

03:02:41.580 --> 03:02:42.580
Yeah.

03:02:42.580 --> 03:02:47.720
Have you seen a lot of hot sluts?

03:02:47.720 --> 03:02:49.240
I will make you really answer that.

03:02:49.240 --> 03:02:50.240
Oh, yeah.

03:02:50.240 --> 03:02:51.240
Oh, yeah.

03:02:51.240 --> 03:02:52.240
Here's the thing.

03:02:52.240 --> 03:02:53.240
Here's the thing, Rob.

03:02:53.240 --> 03:02:54.840
Here's the thing.

03:02:54.840 --> 03:02:55.840
What?

03:02:55.840 --> 03:03:00.840
The saying goes, if you don't get laid at Dragon Con, you're not trying.

03:03:00.840 --> 03:03:05.800
Yeah, I've heard that those furries can get pretty aggressive.

03:03:05.800 --> 03:03:06.800
It's like the Ren Faire.

03:03:06.800 --> 03:03:10.800
Just walk into one of those little gift party rooms and you'll have a good time.

03:03:10.800 --> 03:03:13.640
Thankfully, I have not seen a single one of them.

03:03:13.640 --> 03:03:14.640
You haven't seen a furry?

03:03:14.640 --> 03:03:17.040
Well, because they're all too busy at the orgy.

03:03:17.040 --> 03:03:18.040
That's why they're...

03:03:18.040 --> 03:03:19.040
Yes.

03:03:19.040 --> 03:03:22.880
If you haven't seen a furry, you're not trying hard enough.

03:03:22.880 --> 03:03:27.440
And they don't need a Craigslist posting to get that going.

03:03:27.440 --> 03:03:28.440
They can't now.

03:03:28.440 --> 03:03:33.920
Craigslist has censored the adult services section now on Craigslist, apparently.

03:03:33.920 --> 03:03:34.920
So there you go.

03:03:34.920 --> 03:03:36.320
But Pac needed a Craigslist post to do it.

03:03:36.320 --> 03:03:37.320
You don't need that here.

03:03:37.320 --> 03:03:38.320
It just happens.

03:03:38.320 --> 03:03:39.320
All right.

03:03:39.320 --> 03:03:41.520
Bobby, we're going to let you go.

03:03:41.520 --> 03:03:42.840
Have fun at Dragon Con.

03:03:42.840 --> 03:03:46.240
Have a blast, especially for us since we're not there, since it seems like everybody else

03:03:46.240 --> 03:03:48.420
is going to some convention but us.

03:03:48.420 --> 03:03:51.120
And we'll have a drink in your honor a little later, all right?

03:03:51.120 --> 03:03:52.120
Excellent.

03:03:52.120 --> 03:03:54.240
I'll have a drink in your honor over here, too.

03:03:54.240 --> 03:03:55.240
Sounds good.

03:03:55.240 --> 03:03:56.240
All right.

03:03:56.240 --> 03:03:57.240
Have a good one, Bobby.

03:03:57.240 --> 03:03:58.240
See you.

03:03:58.240 --> 03:03:59.240
All right.

03:03:59.240 --> 03:04:02.600
Bobby Blackwolf, the man who is usually live right now at All Games Radio, but it's a special

03:04:02.600 --> 03:04:03.600
weekend.

03:04:03.600 --> 03:04:04.680
It's Labor Day weekend.

03:04:04.680 --> 03:04:05.680
We're doing a marathon.

03:04:05.680 --> 03:04:07.320
He's at Dragon Con.

03:04:07.320 --> 03:04:09.080
Scott's at Burning Man.

03:04:09.080 --> 03:04:13.280
Most people are at Pac's, but we're right here in the OLR Studios, and boy, aren't we

03:04:13.280 --> 03:04:14.760
having fun together.

03:04:14.760 --> 03:04:18.600
Actually, there's quite a few of you listening tonight, so I really appreciate that.

03:04:18.600 --> 03:04:20.720
It looks like you guys are with us here.

03:04:20.720 --> 03:04:23.240
So we're going to keep going and take some more calls.

03:04:23.240 --> 03:04:26.520
1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLawnTradial.

03:04:26.520 --> 03:04:30.040
We'll get in at least a couple more calls before the next break and before we say goodbye

03:04:30.040 --> 03:04:33.440
to Loki for the night, and then we'll... I don't know what we'll do.

03:04:33.440 --> 03:04:36.800
I'm thinking maybe for the next segment, Dark Sakura, I told you we should think of this.

03:04:36.800 --> 03:04:41.680
Maybe we'll go into the vault and just pull some random games and talk about them.

03:04:41.680 --> 03:04:42.680
Okay.

03:04:42.680 --> 03:04:44.720
Like maybe like gaming memories or whatever.

03:04:44.720 --> 03:04:45.720
Okay.

03:04:45.720 --> 03:04:47.960
But we also... We need to take the chat room into the vault somehow.

03:04:47.960 --> 03:04:49.520
Do we have a laptop or anything?

03:04:49.520 --> 03:04:51.320
I got... Why am I not in the car?

03:04:51.320 --> 03:04:52.320
Yeah.

03:04:52.320 --> 03:04:53.320
I can do that.

03:04:53.320 --> 03:04:54.320
Okay.

03:04:54.320 --> 03:04:55.320
Do you know that you have the password to your Wi-Fi so we can...

03:04:55.320 --> 03:04:56.320
Yes.

03:04:56.320 --> 03:04:57.320
Okay.

03:04:57.320 --> 03:04:58.320
Good.

03:04:58.320 --> 03:04:59.320
Good deal.

03:04:59.320 --> 03:05:00.320
We'll do that.

03:05:00.320 --> 03:05:01.320
And then you get to hear what it is.

03:05:01.320 --> 03:05:03.560
Do they have like an app or something on the iPhone that you can do like a Justin TV or

03:05:03.560 --> 03:05:04.560
something?

03:05:04.560 --> 03:05:06.720
There is... Yes.

03:05:06.720 --> 03:05:09.120
I have a Ustream.

03:05:09.120 --> 03:05:12.400
We've actually had for several years, and I guess now's the time to say it.

03:05:12.400 --> 03:05:14.200
We've had a secret Ustream channel.

03:05:14.200 --> 03:05:15.200
It's not that secret.

03:05:15.200 --> 03:05:21.080
It's just that before we went to Justin TV, literally the week before, I reserved a Ustream

03:05:21.080 --> 03:05:22.080
for us.

03:05:22.080 --> 03:05:26.160
But we opted to go with Justin TV because that's where the All Games Network went.

03:05:26.160 --> 03:05:30.280
And it seemed like most of the folks in the shows that we're related to and so forth all

03:05:30.280 --> 03:05:31.760
went towards Justin TV.

03:05:31.760 --> 03:05:37.040
So we went there for the whole Synergy thing because it was kind of the same thing.

03:05:37.040 --> 03:05:42.120
Now that that isn't really the case anymore, there's... Some of our fans still broadcast

03:05:42.120 --> 03:05:45.240
on Justin TV, and I think that's really cool.

03:05:45.240 --> 03:05:48.040
But I did get a Ustream application for the phone.

03:05:48.040 --> 03:05:52.840
I actually did a test run the other night just to see how well it worked.

03:05:52.840 --> 03:05:58.200
The video quality's kind of poop, but it does let you stream over 3G.

03:05:58.200 --> 03:06:00.360
So it's kind of neat in that regard.

03:06:00.360 --> 03:06:01.360
So I don't know.

03:06:01.360 --> 03:06:02.360
Maybe we'll broadcast.

03:06:02.360 --> 03:06:06.960
But I just... I think the video quality is such poop, and we're a radio show.

03:06:06.960 --> 03:06:08.520
I don't know if it's really worth it, to be honest.

03:06:08.520 --> 03:06:12.320
If you associate your iPhone with the Wi-Fi here, would the app then associate with the

03:06:12.320 --> 03:06:13.320
Wi-Fi?

03:06:13.320 --> 03:06:15.520
It would, but my concern is that it's going to have this-

03:06:15.520 --> 03:06:16.520
Oh, it's going to choke the stream.

03:06:16.520 --> 03:06:21.880
It's going to choke the stream, which we were having those problems earlier when the feed

03:06:21.880 --> 03:06:23.360
was unknowingly broadcasting.

03:06:23.360 --> 03:06:24.360
So yeah.

03:06:24.360 --> 03:06:27.320
Yeah, we've had a Orange Launch Radio Ustream for like three years.

03:06:27.320 --> 03:06:28.320
We just don't use it.

03:06:28.320 --> 03:06:29.320
There you go.

03:06:29.320 --> 03:06:30.680
And I actually kind of agree with Derek.

03:06:30.680 --> 03:06:31.680
Justin kind of sucks now.

03:06:31.680 --> 03:06:34.560
Like the whole... It's just not quite what it used to be.

03:06:34.560 --> 03:06:38.080
You know, a Ustream has sort of established itself as the definitive place to go for

03:06:38.080 --> 03:06:40.320
streaming and... I don't know.

03:06:40.320 --> 03:06:43.280
I don't know if... I really would have to explore.

03:06:43.280 --> 03:06:46.640
We haven't had videos so long now, ever since we switched studios, that I'd really have

03:06:46.640 --> 03:06:47.640
to explore that.

03:06:47.640 --> 03:06:48.640
So we'll see.

03:06:48.640 --> 03:06:49.640
All right.

03:06:49.640 --> 03:06:52.400
Anyhow, I didn't mean to get off topic.

03:06:52.400 --> 03:06:54.120
I was waiting for calls, but none are coming in.

03:06:54.120 --> 03:06:56.120
What is... How are we going to do a marathon with no calls?

03:06:56.120 --> 03:06:57.120
We're screwed.

03:06:57.120 --> 03:06:58.120
Dammit, people.

03:06:58.120 --> 03:06:59.120
Call.

03:06:59.120 --> 03:07:01.440
We'll try to get at least one more call in before we say goodbye to Loki.

03:07:01.440 --> 03:07:05.960
1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, if you want to give us

03:07:05.960 --> 03:07:07.040
a call.

03:07:07.040 --> 03:07:09.680
We'll try to squeeze in at least one more call, but if you don't get in now, that's

03:07:09.680 --> 03:07:10.680
okay.

03:07:10.680 --> 03:07:13.800
We'll open it up again around the usual time, about eight o'clock later this evening, and

03:07:13.800 --> 03:07:16.920
so forth, during the OLR marathon.

03:07:16.920 --> 03:07:20.200
We also have some more stories we're going to do.

03:07:20.200 --> 03:07:24.720
If I have time to write them while other people are talking, and I'm not so intoxicated after

03:07:24.720 --> 03:07:28.040
that drink, we will do some OLR games.

03:07:28.040 --> 03:07:29.200
We need a listless topic.

03:07:29.200 --> 03:07:30.200
We can think of that later.

03:07:30.200 --> 03:07:31.200
Totally.

03:07:31.200 --> 03:07:32.200
And we should do match game?

03:07:32.200 --> 03:07:33.200
We'll do match game.

03:07:33.200 --> 03:07:35.760
We have at least four people here, and with Dan we'll have five, so we can do a match

03:07:35.760 --> 03:07:36.760
game.

03:07:36.760 --> 03:07:39.680
We could also do Mad Libs.

03:07:39.680 --> 03:07:42.680
You never did do OLR Mad Libs.

03:07:42.680 --> 03:07:46.120
The phone is ringing and my back is turned, I can't even see it, shame on me.

03:07:46.120 --> 03:07:47.120
Let's go to the phones.

03:07:47.120 --> 03:07:48.120
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

03:07:48.120 --> 03:07:49.120
Who's this?

03:07:49.120 --> 03:07:50.120
This is Haseo.

03:07:50.120 --> 03:07:51.120
Taseo?

03:07:51.120 --> 03:07:52.120
Haseo Sumerakawa.

03:07:52.120 --> 03:07:53.120
Oh, Haseo.

03:07:53.120 --> 03:07:54.120
Okay, hi, how you doing?

03:07:54.120 --> 03:07:55.120
I'm doing good.

03:07:55.120 --> 03:07:56.120
Good.

03:07:56.120 --> 03:07:57.120
What is on your mind, my friend?

03:07:57.120 --> 03:08:09.520
I just want to say that role-playing quests are a bitch.

03:08:09.520 --> 03:08:10.640
Role-playing quests are a bitch?

03:08:10.640 --> 03:08:13.060
What game are you playing right now?

03:08:13.060 --> 03:08:17.880
I am playing a free-to-play MMO called Nabinogi.

03:08:17.880 --> 03:08:20.920
I have never heard of this, so you've got to tell us a little more about this.

03:08:20.920 --> 03:08:23.840
Is there a website you can download this at or anything like that?

03:08:23.840 --> 03:08:28.360
Yeah, the Nexon.nabinogi.com.

03:08:28.360 --> 03:08:33.080
They also do MapleStory and The League Fighter and whatnot.

03:08:33.080 --> 03:08:37.120
So is this a very MapleStory-esque kind of game or is this like more Warcraft inspired

03:08:37.120 --> 03:08:38.440
or what's this game kind of like?

03:08:38.440 --> 03:08:40.440
It's like Warcraft meets anime.

03:08:40.440 --> 03:08:41.440
Interesting.

03:08:41.440 --> 03:08:43.440
That could be interesting.

03:08:43.440 --> 03:08:44.440
And it's free?

03:08:44.440 --> 03:08:46.440
Is it ad-supported or what's the deal?

03:08:46.440 --> 03:08:50.320
It's 100% free.

03:08:50.320 --> 03:08:58.880
You can upgrade to a membership for a month, which gives you a possibility to run a guild,

03:08:58.880 --> 03:09:03.120
open shops, use a bag, whatnot.

03:09:03.120 --> 03:09:04.120
Cool.

03:09:04.120 --> 03:09:06.280
But this game is being a pain in the ass right now?

03:09:06.280 --> 03:09:10.080
That's why you're saying that role-playing quests are a bitch?

03:09:10.080 --> 03:09:18.280
Yes, because each expansion is a generation, otherwise known as a G and then the number

03:09:18.280 --> 03:09:20.440
of the expansion level.

03:09:20.440 --> 03:09:27.240
And throughout all G1, your character has to role-play as a character named Tarwhak

03:09:27.240 --> 03:09:31.400
who pretty much only uses a loot as a weapon, otherwise you can fight bare-handed and use

03:09:31.400 --> 03:09:32.400
magic.

03:09:32.400 --> 03:09:33.400
Interesting.

03:09:33.400 --> 03:09:34.960
What turned you on to this game?

03:09:34.960 --> 03:09:37.800
How'd you find out about it?

03:09:37.800 --> 03:09:42.800
My friend actually plays it, who I was PVPing against.

03:09:42.800 --> 03:09:43.800
Very cool.

03:09:43.800 --> 03:09:44.800
Very cool.

03:09:44.800 --> 03:09:49.320
Quickly, what other games types of stuff are you into?

03:09:49.320 --> 03:09:54.920
I played just about anything except for anything that has Hannah Montana or Barbie attached

03:09:54.920 --> 03:09:55.920
to it.

03:09:55.920 --> 03:10:00.000
You know the Hannah Montana game on DS is apparently pretty sweet, so I'm just saying.

03:10:00.000 --> 03:10:02.640
I heard there was a music game on the DS that was actually pretty sweet.

03:10:02.640 --> 03:10:03.640
Just saying.

03:10:03.640 --> 03:10:04.640
All right.

03:10:04.640 --> 03:10:05.640
Hannah needs to burp.

03:10:05.640 --> 03:10:11.600
All right, any other parting words for our listeners tonight before we let you go?

03:10:11.600 --> 03:10:17.360
Hm, the Neutron movie will be epic.

03:10:17.360 --> 03:10:22.100
It better be, because Dark Soccer and I are planning an epic trip that will probably pre-empt

03:10:22.100 --> 03:10:27.120
the show to go on this stupid trip, so stay tuned.

03:10:27.120 --> 03:10:30.440
All right, thank you so much for the call, Haseo, and stay tuned.

03:10:30.440 --> 03:10:33.040
Are you going to listen for a few more hours to the marathon tonight?

03:10:33.040 --> 03:10:35.880
Yes, I'm listening to the whole thing.

03:10:35.880 --> 03:10:36.880
The whole thing.

03:10:36.880 --> 03:10:37.880
Good luck, buddy.

03:10:37.880 --> 03:10:38.880
All right.

03:10:38.880 --> 03:10:39.880
Take care, my friend.

03:10:39.880 --> 03:10:40.880
All right, thanks.

03:10:40.880 --> 03:10:43.720
1877 Game OLR, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

03:10:43.720 --> 03:10:45.440
We can fit in one more call.

03:10:45.440 --> 03:10:46.440
Why not?

03:10:46.440 --> 03:10:47.440
We got time.

03:10:47.440 --> 03:10:48.440
We got a lot of time.

03:10:48.440 --> 03:10:50.440
A lot of time.

03:10:50.440 --> 03:10:54.240
1877 Game OLR, if you want to give us a call, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

03:10:54.240 --> 03:10:57.120
Have we figured out the whole dinner thing yet?

03:10:57.120 --> 03:10:58.120
Are we doing a...

03:10:58.120 --> 03:11:00.080
We're going to get taken bakes.

03:11:00.080 --> 03:11:01.080
Awesome.

03:11:01.080 --> 03:11:03.040
We wanted someone to make the Papa Murphy's run.

03:11:03.040 --> 03:11:04.040
Okay.

03:11:04.040 --> 03:11:07.120
When I sober up, I can go, but that's going to take me at least another hour.

03:11:07.120 --> 03:11:08.120
Okay.

03:11:08.120 --> 03:11:09.120
But I can't drink anything until then.

03:11:09.120 --> 03:11:10.120
You want some Triscuits?

03:11:10.120 --> 03:11:11.120
Okay.

03:11:11.120 --> 03:11:12.120
That would be lovely.

03:11:12.120 --> 03:11:13.120
Okay.

03:11:13.120 --> 03:11:14.120
All right.

03:11:14.120 --> 03:11:16.600
1877 Game OLR, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

03:11:16.600 --> 03:11:18.800
Loki's going to be leaving us after we go to the next break.

03:11:18.800 --> 03:11:20.480
I should really take a nap when I get home.

03:11:20.480 --> 03:11:22.720
I woke up at four o'clock in the morning this morning.

03:11:22.720 --> 03:11:25.640
I was going to ask, what is it that you're going to be doing when you go home?

03:11:25.640 --> 03:11:26.640
Um...

03:11:26.640 --> 03:11:27.640
Babysitting?

03:11:27.640 --> 03:11:32.480
I'm going to be watching the baby, probably go to bed at like...

03:11:32.480 --> 03:11:35.640
You know, I always say I'm going to go to bed early, but it ends up being 11.

03:11:35.640 --> 03:11:39.820
I'm going to work on my Grand Theft Auto mods if I can, and I have to go grocery shopping

03:11:39.820 --> 03:11:42.040
because we have nothing in the house.

03:11:42.040 --> 03:11:49.880
And then what else do I have to do?

03:11:49.880 --> 03:11:51.360
Maybe bid on something on eBay.

03:11:51.360 --> 03:11:52.360
Bid on something on eBay.

03:11:52.360 --> 03:11:53.360
Yeah.

03:11:53.360 --> 03:11:54.360
All right.

03:11:54.360 --> 03:11:55.360
Good stuff.

03:11:55.360 --> 03:11:56.360
All right.

03:11:56.360 --> 03:11:57.360
I might be...

03:11:57.360 --> 03:12:05.480
Well, I should be getting a Kinect camera in the next few weeks.

03:12:05.480 --> 03:12:06.480
Ooh!

03:12:06.480 --> 03:12:07.760
Well, good luck with that.

03:12:07.760 --> 03:12:09.380
And this is not one of the beta cameras.

03:12:09.380 --> 03:12:14.960
This is actually the real retail camera with the retail version of Kinect adventures.

03:12:14.960 --> 03:12:19.000
If the guy doesn't deliver it, though, then I will give it my back.

03:12:19.000 --> 03:12:20.000
Something's going on.

03:12:20.000 --> 03:12:21.920
We might not be broadcasting right now.

03:12:21.920 --> 03:12:24.840
It looks like our Winamp is frozen.

03:12:24.840 --> 03:12:27.320
I'm not seeing anything in chat.

03:12:27.320 --> 03:12:31.240
But let's just keep going for the podcast's sake.

03:12:31.240 --> 03:12:34.920
I don't know what's going on.

03:12:34.920 --> 03:12:36.280
If folks can hear us or what have you.

03:12:36.280 --> 03:12:37.280
But it looks like...

03:12:37.280 --> 03:12:38.280
I'm keeping up with the chat room.

03:12:38.280 --> 03:12:39.280
Shit.

03:12:39.280 --> 03:12:41.760
The last thing I saw was somebody saying parting words for Loki.

03:12:41.760 --> 03:12:43.320
Did you see anything after that?

03:12:43.320 --> 03:12:44.320
That's all I saw.

03:12:44.320 --> 03:12:45.960
I typed while we were broadcasting.

03:12:45.960 --> 03:12:47.600
I didn't see that.

03:12:47.600 --> 03:12:48.600
Something's wrong.

03:12:48.600 --> 03:12:49.600
So they're not hearing us right now.

03:12:49.600 --> 03:12:51.240
I'm going to start and stop our feed.

03:12:51.240 --> 03:12:52.240
Yeah.

03:12:52.240 --> 03:12:54.160
It says my nickname's in use already.

03:12:54.160 --> 03:12:55.160
Shit.

03:12:55.160 --> 03:12:56.160
I'm disconnected.

03:12:56.160 --> 03:12:57.160
Okay.

03:12:57.160 --> 03:12:58.160
That's not good.

03:12:58.160 --> 03:12:59.160
So we're going to...

03:12:59.160 --> 03:13:00.160
Oh, now I'm back.

03:13:00.160 --> 03:13:02.480
We're going to reconnect right now.

03:13:02.480 --> 03:13:04.880
How many times is this going to happen tonight?

03:13:04.880 --> 03:13:07.220
Oh, shit.

03:13:07.220 --> 03:13:09.240
And I reconnected using the wrong encoder.

03:13:09.240 --> 03:13:10.600
That's real good, Rob.

03:13:10.600 --> 03:13:13.240
Real good.

03:13:13.240 --> 03:13:18.960
Live radio, the joys, the perils, the heartache, the trials, the tribulations.

03:13:18.960 --> 03:13:19.960
Okay.

03:13:19.960 --> 03:13:20.960
We're back up.

03:13:20.960 --> 03:13:21.960
We're live.

03:13:21.960 --> 03:13:23.440
So slowly folks are going to be coming back on.

03:13:23.440 --> 03:13:27.060
That might explain why the Skype line hasn't been ringing if our internet just suddenly

03:13:27.060 --> 03:13:28.600
decided to crap out.

03:13:28.600 --> 03:13:29.600
All right.

03:13:29.600 --> 03:13:31.520
It looks like I'm reconnecting slowly but surely.

03:13:31.520 --> 03:13:32.520
Oh, no.

03:13:32.520 --> 03:13:33.520
It died again.

03:13:33.520 --> 03:13:34.520
I've been on AIM the entire time.

03:13:34.520 --> 03:13:35.520
It just died again.

03:13:35.520 --> 03:13:36.520
It died again?

03:13:36.520 --> 03:13:40.440
I've been on AIM the entire time and had no problem.

03:13:40.440 --> 03:13:46.600
It shows that we are connected on Shoutcast.

03:13:46.600 --> 03:13:48.600
This is bad stuff.

03:13:48.600 --> 03:13:51.320
Says auto-excessive connections from a single host.

03:13:51.320 --> 03:13:52.320
Oh, fuck.

03:13:52.320 --> 03:13:55.640
G line from Game Surge.

03:13:55.640 --> 03:13:59.440
So we got booted from chat altogether because there's too many of us trying to connect because

03:13:59.440 --> 03:14:02.280
our ghosts were still lurking there.

03:14:02.280 --> 03:14:03.280
That's great.

03:14:03.280 --> 03:14:05.980
So we might've just lost the chat room for the rest of the evening.

03:14:05.980 --> 03:14:07.080
That is wonderful.

03:14:07.080 --> 03:14:11.200
Those G lines reset after like 10, 15 minutes.

03:14:11.200 --> 03:14:12.200
It really depends.

03:14:12.200 --> 03:14:13.200
Yeah.

03:14:13.200 --> 03:14:14.200
Do they?

03:14:14.200 --> 03:14:15.200
Yeah.

03:14:15.200 --> 03:14:16.200
All right.

03:14:16.200 --> 03:14:17.200
Have some driscuits, Rob.

03:14:17.200 --> 03:14:18.200
Great.

03:14:18.200 --> 03:14:19.200
So now we have to marathon with no chat room.

03:14:19.200 --> 03:14:20.200
This ought to be lovely.

03:14:20.200 --> 03:14:21.200
For now.

03:14:21.200 --> 03:14:22.200
Well.

03:14:22.200 --> 03:14:23.200
Well, that sucks.

03:14:23.200 --> 03:14:24.200
Got to go now.

03:14:24.200 --> 03:14:25.200
All right.

03:14:25.200 --> 03:14:26.200
This is great.

03:14:26.200 --> 03:14:35.600
If I probably load the Twitter, there's going to be a million people tweeting going.

03:14:35.600 --> 03:14:39.280
Try it through the web browser because that uses like a proxy thing.

03:14:39.280 --> 03:14:40.280
Oh, does it?

03:14:40.280 --> 03:14:41.280
I'll do that.

03:14:41.280 --> 03:14:43.680
I need someone to help me fill time here real quick.

03:14:43.680 --> 03:14:44.680
Something so.

03:14:44.680 --> 03:14:45.680
I'm sorry.

03:14:45.680 --> 03:14:46.680
We're all here chewing on triscuits.

03:14:46.680 --> 03:14:47.680
Yep.

03:14:47.680 --> 03:14:48.680
That's the marathon.

03:14:48.680 --> 03:14:58.640
It's just going to be like eight hours of this chewing on triscuits and Rob hunting

03:14:58.640 --> 03:14:59.640
down a way to get in.

03:14:59.640 --> 03:15:00.640
I need to get our chat.

03:15:00.640 --> 03:15:01.640
The chat's like, Oh God.

03:15:01.640 --> 03:15:02.640
It wants me to install Java.

03:15:02.640 --> 03:15:06.560
Let me try to reconnect here real quick on the old fashioned way.

03:15:06.560 --> 03:15:10.180
See if that works.

03:15:10.180 --> 03:15:11.180
We need chat.

03:15:11.180 --> 03:15:12.760
Our Skype line is supposedly open.

03:15:12.760 --> 03:15:15.920
So if somebody can hear us, somebody call us shit.

03:15:15.920 --> 03:15:24.200
Yeah, no, it's showing that we're G line still because I guess too many of us run at once.

03:15:24.200 --> 03:15:25.200
We're up though.

03:15:25.200 --> 03:15:32.440
According to try the chat app and IE maybe if it's on that machine.

03:15:32.440 --> 03:15:35.800
Because Java may be separate for Firefox if that's what you're using.

03:15:35.800 --> 03:15:41.600
Um, let me, Oh, I will do that.

03:15:41.600 --> 03:15:45.400
Our Skype line is still open one eight seven seven game OLR or our username on Skype is

03:15:45.400 --> 03:15:48.960
orange lounge radio.

03:15:48.960 --> 03:15:51.040
Your mic is also dying a lot.

03:15:51.040 --> 03:15:52.040
I'm in web chat.

03:15:52.040 --> 03:15:53.040
Trying to get there.

03:15:53.040 --> 03:15:54.040
Anyway.

03:15:54.040 --> 03:15:55.040
Are you?

03:15:55.040 --> 03:15:57.200
It still says G line for web chat.

03:15:57.200 --> 03:15:59.840
So Oh, Oh, we're getting at least a call.

03:15:59.840 --> 03:16:00.840
Hi.

03:16:00.840 --> 03:16:01.840
We're on orange.

03:16:01.840 --> 03:16:02.840
Who's this?

03:16:02.840 --> 03:16:03.840
It's Rodney again.

03:16:03.840 --> 03:16:06.640
Just calling your support team staff because that's pretty much what I am.

03:16:06.640 --> 03:16:07.640
You again.

03:16:07.640 --> 03:16:08.640
All right.

03:16:08.640 --> 03:16:09.760
Well, uh, we're, we're up, right?

03:16:09.760 --> 03:16:11.120
You guys can hear us again?

03:16:11.120 --> 03:16:12.120
Yeah.

03:16:12.120 --> 03:16:13.120
We can hear you fine.

03:16:13.120 --> 03:16:16.280
It's just that the whole G line thing, cause that popped up those, that happens when it's

03:16:16.280 --> 03:16:21.780
like more than three or four people from the same IP that logs into the chat, which is

03:16:21.780 --> 03:16:24.760
custom that dark soccer, myself and Loki will all log in.

03:16:24.760 --> 03:16:28.920
But unfortunately when we tried to log back in after we got booted from our internet,

03:16:28.920 --> 03:16:29.920
we all got G lines.

03:16:29.920 --> 03:16:32.360
So yeah, we don't have a chat right now.

03:16:32.360 --> 03:16:35.800
I just sent you guys a tweet, how to, how to circumvent the whole thing.

03:16:35.800 --> 03:16:41.520
Um, I think don't, don't we just have to wait like 15 minutes and we'll be fine.

03:16:41.520 --> 03:16:43.760
I don't know how long you have to wait.

03:16:43.760 --> 03:16:47.720
I'm just saying if you go to mibbit.com, it'll, you can log in that way.

03:16:47.720 --> 03:16:48.720
All right.

03:16:48.720 --> 03:16:49.720
Maybe we'll look at that.

03:16:49.720 --> 03:16:50.720
All right.

03:16:50.720 --> 03:16:51.720
We'll look into that.

03:16:51.720 --> 03:16:52.720
Dark soccer's looking at that.

03:16:52.720 --> 03:16:53.720
I tried.

03:16:53.720 --> 03:16:54.720
It didn't work.

03:16:54.720 --> 03:16:55.720
All right.

03:16:55.720 --> 03:16:56.720
Let me take a call.

03:16:56.720 --> 03:16:57.720
I'm gonna take a call from another number.

03:16:57.720 --> 03:16:58.720
Okay.

03:16:58.720 --> 03:16:59.720
All right.

03:16:59.720 --> 03:17:00.720
Let me take a call from Eric.

03:17:00.720 --> 03:17:01.720
Hello.

03:17:01.720 --> 03:17:02.720
This is Eric Hatcher, AKA Tri-Team.

03:17:02.720 --> 03:17:05.720
I've been a long time listener, but I work mostly.

03:17:05.720 --> 03:17:08.200
Oh, well, Hey, what's on your mind, buddy?

03:17:08.200 --> 03:17:10.940
We're having, this is a heck of a night to call in and we're just having technical difficulties

03:17:10.940 --> 03:17:11.940
left and right.

03:17:11.940 --> 03:17:12.940
We can't see our audience right now.

03:17:12.940 --> 03:17:17.520
Well, that's probably the reason I called, I guess I'm, uh, if I sound out of breath,

03:17:17.520 --> 03:17:21.720
it's cause I'm on the walking track and I'm using you guys to pass the time while I work

03:17:21.720 --> 03:17:25.720
off the weight on my long ass game butt.

03:17:25.720 --> 03:17:26.720
Wow.

03:17:26.720 --> 03:17:29.000
What, what, what types of games do you, uh, what types of games are you into?

03:17:29.000 --> 03:17:30.000
What types of games do you play?

03:17:30.000 --> 03:17:31.000
Oh, just a little bit of everything.

03:17:31.000 --> 03:17:38.040
Um, pretty much all the modern systems, I'd say, uh, I'm mostly the Xbox 360 and, uh,

03:17:38.040 --> 03:17:43.720
of course I get my NMO RPG, uh, still on EverQuest still.

03:17:43.720 --> 03:17:45.960
Still EverQuest after all these years?

03:17:45.960 --> 03:17:46.960
Why EverQuest?

03:17:46.960 --> 03:17:52.680
Well, I guess just cause of the people I know there, I've been, uh, on the same, well, other

03:17:52.680 --> 03:17:57.000
than the server mergers, I've been on the same server for 11 years now.

03:17:57.000 --> 03:17:59.720
And it's, it's probably the people that keep you coming back, huh?

03:17:59.720 --> 03:18:00.720
Really?

03:18:00.720 --> 03:18:02.040
That is exactly what it is.

03:18:02.040 --> 03:18:05.520
Yeah, I can see that cause, uh, that's part of the, pretty much a lot of the reason why

03:18:05.520 --> 03:18:06.520
I keep playing Wow.

03:18:06.520 --> 03:18:10.060
Like, I know a lot of people are like, oh, you're an addict, you play Wow all the time

03:18:10.060 --> 03:18:11.060
and so forth.

03:18:11.060 --> 03:18:14.440
I'm like, well, it's really the social element, the game I can kind of give or take, but it's

03:18:14.440 --> 03:18:18.800
really the, excuse me, the social element that keeps me coming back.

03:18:18.800 --> 03:18:24.840
I agree 100%, that's exactly why I've kept playing for so long.

03:18:24.840 --> 03:18:25.840
So very cool.

03:18:25.840 --> 03:18:30.000
Well, um, let's see, any new stories that you want to comment on that we talked about

03:18:30.000 --> 03:18:31.000
tonight?

03:18:31.000 --> 03:18:32.800
Uh, I don't know.

03:18:32.800 --> 03:18:39.240
I haven't, uh, I just talked, uh, oh, the last about 20 or 30 minutes or so, something

03:18:39.240 --> 03:18:43.640
I guess I'd like to talk about is, uh, I don't know if y'all are familiar, there's a game

03:18:43.640 --> 03:18:47.800
that came out within the last couple of weeks, uh, last week or so called elemental, the

03:18:47.800 --> 03:18:51.720
war of magic on the PC, it paddles a lot of trouble.

03:18:51.720 --> 03:18:52.960
I think I've heard of it.

03:18:52.960 --> 03:18:56.200
Uh, yeah, I don't think I've played, I know I haven't played it, but I think I've heard

03:18:56.200 --> 03:18:57.200
of this.

03:18:57.200 --> 03:18:58.200
Tell us a little bit more about this game.

03:18:58.200 --> 03:19:04.160
Well, it's, uh, by, uh, the company StarDuck and, uh, StarDock and, uh, Brad Wardall is,

03:19:04.160 --> 03:19:07.160
uh, probably the lead designer on that, I believe.

03:19:07.160 --> 03:19:13.640
Pretty, uh, nice guy, but this is the worst, uh, um, most, ws piece of software I've played

03:19:13.640 --> 03:19:22.200
in the last 20 years, I guess, of playing, uh, computer games.

03:19:22.200 --> 03:19:24.200
Hmm.

03:19:24.200 --> 03:19:28.120
Which is very unfortunate, the game has a lot of potential, if any of you are familiar

03:19:28.120 --> 03:19:34.480
with, uh, Masters of Magic, it's sort of a civilization-like game with a fantasy bent.

03:19:34.480 --> 03:19:37.600
Ooh, those are like all of my favorite games you just said.

03:19:37.600 --> 03:19:44.600
Exactly, and, uh, it has so much potential, but it just didn't work out, unfortunately.

03:19:44.600 --> 03:19:46.320
That's too bad.

03:19:46.320 --> 03:19:50.680
I hate it when you got a game that sounds like such a good idea, like on paper, but

03:19:50.680 --> 03:19:52.560
then in execution it sucks.

03:19:52.560 --> 03:19:53.560
Ah, exactly.

03:19:53.560 --> 03:19:54.560
Yeah.

03:19:54.560 --> 03:20:01.120
Uh, anyway, I just mostly called to help you out with a little bit of time, I don't really

03:20:01.120 --> 03:20:02.480
have a whole lot to say.

03:20:02.480 --> 03:20:03.480
That's alright, we like hearing from you.

03:20:03.480 --> 03:20:04.480
Wait, where'd you say you're calling from?

03:20:04.480 --> 03:20:05.480
Uh, big pardon?

03:20:05.480 --> 03:20:08.480
Where'd you say you're calling from?

03:20:08.480 --> 03:20:11.880
Oh, uh, basically Birmingham, Alabama.

03:20:11.880 --> 03:20:12.880
Really?

03:20:12.880 --> 03:20:13.880
From my home state then?

03:20:13.880 --> 03:20:14.880
Oh, exactly.

03:20:14.880 --> 03:20:21.480
Now, I've, I've, uh, spent many, many a time up in Birmingham, and, uh, although I spent

03:20:21.480 --> 03:20:28.440
more time around Dothan and Montgomery, so, but yeah, Mobile's my hometown.

03:20:28.440 --> 03:20:30.440
So nice to talk to someone from my home state.

03:20:30.440 --> 03:20:31.440
Welcome.

03:20:31.440 --> 03:20:32.440
Woo!

03:20:32.440 --> 03:20:37.960
Nice talking to y'all, and I look forward to seeing you more as they continue to progress.

03:20:37.960 --> 03:20:38.960
Alright, sounds good.

03:20:38.960 --> 03:20:39.960
You have a good one, buddy.

03:20:39.960 --> 03:20:40.960
Take care.

03:20:40.960 --> 03:20:41.960
Thanks for tuning in.

03:20:41.960 --> 03:20:42.960
Take care.

03:20:42.960 --> 03:20:43.960
Bye bye.

03:20:43.960 --> 03:20:44.960
Bye bye.

03:20:44.960 --> 03:20:45.960
Alright.

03:20:45.960 --> 03:20:48.640
I can almost always pick out an Alabama accent.

03:20:48.640 --> 03:20:49.640
Yeah?

03:20:49.640 --> 03:20:51.880
So I was like, bing!

03:20:51.880 --> 03:20:52.880
Radar.

03:20:52.880 --> 03:20:53.880
Nice.

03:20:53.880 --> 03:20:55.080
Alright, well, we're gonna go ahead and go to a break.

03:20:55.080 --> 03:21:00.680
I am actually, I just downloaded an IRC chat client to my phone to try and connect.

03:21:00.680 --> 03:21:01.920
Oh, there we go.

03:21:01.920 --> 03:21:04.240
I got it.

03:21:04.240 --> 03:21:06.560
And they're saying, wait, did Loki, yeah, I can see chat.

03:21:06.560 --> 03:21:09.480
So I have chat open on my phone right now.

03:21:09.480 --> 03:21:12.820
So I finally have a lifeblood into the chat room, so, uh, there you go.

03:21:12.820 --> 03:21:16.360
So chatters, I can now see you again.

03:21:16.360 --> 03:21:19.240
Don't send me private messages if you figure out what my name is on there.

03:21:19.240 --> 03:21:20.360
It's not too hard to figure out.

03:21:20.360 --> 03:21:21.360
Don't send me private messages.

03:21:21.360 --> 03:21:23.840
Oh, we had another call coming in.

03:21:23.840 --> 03:21:25.520
This will be our last call before we take another break.

03:21:25.520 --> 03:21:26.520
Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.

03:21:26.520 --> 03:21:27.520
Who's this?

03:21:27.520 --> 03:21:28.520
This is Toa Gak.

03:21:28.520 --> 03:21:29.520
Hey, Toa Gak.

03:21:29.520 --> 03:21:30.520
How are you, buddy?

03:21:30.520 --> 03:21:31.520
What's on your mind?

03:21:31.520 --> 03:21:38.400
Um, I just called in because I'm going to give you the URL you'd need to go to to get

03:21:38.400 --> 03:21:39.600
the G line removed.

03:21:39.600 --> 03:21:41.880
Okay, what is that?

03:21:41.880 --> 03:21:49.640
It's gamesurge.net slash utils slash G line.

03:21:49.640 --> 03:21:53.560
All right, I'm looking at that right now.

03:21:53.560 --> 03:21:57.920
Oh, one G line found for your host resolved in an hour.

03:21:57.920 --> 03:22:07.400
Okay, so I'm on that page and it says why we're banned, okay.

03:22:07.400 --> 03:22:11.200
It will only last one hour, so there you go.

03:22:11.200 --> 03:22:13.160
We just have to wait out the hour then.

03:22:13.160 --> 03:22:14.160
Jerks.

03:22:14.160 --> 03:22:15.160
That's okay.

03:22:15.160 --> 03:22:18.280
So we got till 6 25 and no chat, but that's okay because I got chat on my phone.

03:22:18.280 --> 03:22:19.280
I figured it out.

03:22:19.280 --> 03:22:20.280
I worked around.

03:22:20.280 --> 03:22:21.280
All right.

03:22:21.280 --> 03:22:22.280
Hi.

03:22:22.280 --> 03:22:23.280
Just a, um, listener.

03:22:23.280 --> 03:22:37.980
Just a reminder, it's probably a bad idea to circumvent it, the G line, because they

03:22:37.980 --> 03:22:38.980
can tell.

03:22:38.980 --> 03:22:40.840
Well, no, I'm on my iPhone.

03:22:40.840 --> 03:22:41.840
It's three G.

03:22:41.840 --> 03:22:42.840
It's okay.

03:22:42.840 --> 03:22:43.840
We'll be okay.

03:22:43.840 --> 03:22:44.840
We're not on Comcast.

03:22:44.840 --> 03:22:45.840
It shows us three G.

03:22:45.840 --> 03:22:46.840
Well, it'll be our little secret.

03:22:46.840 --> 03:22:47.840
Okay.

03:22:47.840 --> 03:22:48.840
All right.

03:22:48.840 --> 03:22:49.840
All right.

03:22:49.840 --> 03:22:51.880
Well, thanks for the tip.

03:22:51.880 --> 03:22:52.880
We appreciate it.

03:22:52.880 --> 03:22:55.520
At least we know it's only for an hour, so we know we'll be able to get back in.

03:22:55.520 --> 03:22:57.520
All right.

03:22:57.520 --> 03:22:59.520
Have a good one, buddy.

03:22:59.520 --> 03:23:00.520
Okay.

03:23:00.520 --> 03:23:01.520
Bye.

03:23:01.520 --> 03:23:02.520
Thanks for the tip.

03:23:02.520 --> 03:23:03.520
All right.

03:23:03.520 --> 03:23:06.160
We're gonna on that note, I think we need a break after that.

03:23:06.160 --> 03:23:07.160
Oh boy.

03:23:07.160 --> 03:23:08.160
All right.

03:23:08.160 --> 03:23:09.480
Uh, people are saying hi.

03:23:09.480 --> 03:23:10.480
Why were you banned?

03:23:10.480 --> 03:23:13.320
Well, they don't like more than three people on the same IP.

03:23:13.320 --> 03:23:14.320
Dranami's got it there.

03:23:14.320 --> 03:23:19.520
And they're saying, actually, it's five, says Toa Gak, but, uh, I don't...

03:23:19.520 --> 03:23:20.520
The various...

03:23:20.520 --> 03:23:24.400
It says three, um, on the page that explains why you're G aligned.

03:23:24.400 --> 03:23:25.400
It's weird.

03:23:25.400 --> 03:23:29.260
When various clients try to reconnect and disconnect due to internet issues within a

03:23:29.260 --> 03:23:33.080
certain amount of time, the server has no way of knowing what's going on and it kind

03:23:33.080 --> 03:23:34.080
of thinks it's a DDoS.

03:23:34.080 --> 03:23:36.200
It's a denial of service, I get it.

03:23:36.200 --> 03:23:38.360
So it's, it's just a fail safe.

03:23:38.360 --> 03:23:40.760
I'll forgive them someday.

03:23:40.760 --> 03:23:42.480
I'll find it in my heart to forgive them.

03:23:42.480 --> 03:23:43.480
All right.

03:23:43.480 --> 03:23:47.040
We're going to, um, actually say goodbye to Loki at this point before we go to another

03:23:47.040 --> 03:23:48.040
break.

03:23:48.040 --> 03:23:49.920
And, uh, Loki, any final words for our listeners tonight?

03:23:49.920 --> 03:23:51.800
No, I just have to go get groceries.

03:23:51.800 --> 03:23:52.800
That's always fun.

03:23:52.800 --> 03:23:54.320
I guess I don't like chores.

03:23:54.320 --> 03:23:55.320
All right.

03:23:55.320 --> 03:23:56.320
Well, good luck with all that.

03:23:56.320 --> 03:24:00.680
Uh, this is actually the part of the show where we would be saying basically, uh, goodnight

03:24:00.680 --> 03:24:01.680
for listening.

03:24:01.680 --> 03:24:04.640
This is kind of the end of the normal part of the show, if you will.

03:24:04.640 --> 03:24:06.200
We're going to be getting into the more random stuff.

03:24:06.200 --> 03:24:09.980
So if you're just looking for your normal quote unquote edition of orange launch radio,

03:24:09.980 --> 03:24:13.200
this is kind of the end of that part, but we will be back in just a little bit with

03:24:13.200 --> 03:24:14.200
more of orange launch radio.

03:24:14.200 --> 03:24:18.480
Now, just so you know, for the podcast feed, we're going to be releasing the marathon in

03:24:18.480 --> 03:24:19.680
bits this week.

03:24:19.680 --> 03:24:22.400
So you may not see everything up right away.

03:24:22.400 --> 03:24:27.160
So you know, just give it a little extra time if the, you know, show, you know, if you're

03:24:27.160 --> 03:24:31.560
done listening to this part of the podcast and you want more, just give it a little more

03:24:31.560 --> 03:24:32.560
time.

03:24:32.560 --> 03:24:33.560
That's all we need.

03:24:33.560 --> 03:24:39.760
Yeah, real quick, I was going to say we're having our game summit, my work game summit

03:24:39.760 --> 03:24:40.760
thing.

03:24:40.760 --> 03:24:44.520
You know, we do it usually each year and, uh, we have the game publishers coming out

03:24:44.520 --> 03:24:45.800
and talking about stuff.

03:24:45.800 --> 03:24:50.840
So maybe I'll learn some new information and we can share it appropriate time if you know

03:24:50.840 --> 03:24:51.840
what I mean.

03:24:51.840 --> 03:24:52.840
All right.

03:24:52.840 --> 03:24:53.840
And that'll be something to look forward to next week.

03:24:53.840 --> 03:24:54.840
Yes, possibly.

03:24:54.840 --> 03:24:57.600
And also hopefully I'll have a new, uh, I've iPod by then.

03:24:57.600 --> 03:24:58.600
All right.

03:24:58.600 --> 03:25:04.240
Well, um, I don't know, should I play the closing song that we usually play at the end

03:25:04.240 --> 03:25:05.240
here?

03:25:05.240 --> 03:25:06.240
Play our little closing song.

03:25:06.240 --> 03:25:07.240
Sure.

03:25:07.240 --> 03:25:08.240
Cause we got to put it on the podcast anyways.

03:25:08.240 --> 03:25:09.240
Don't you?

03:25:09.240 --> 03:25:10.240
I guess that's true.

03:25:10.240 --> 03:25:11.240
So let me see.

03:25:11.240 --> 03:25:13.400
I now I have to cue that up that that involves work.

03:25:13.400 --> 03:25:14.400
So good night everybody.

03:25:14.400 --> 03:25:15.400
Thanks for listening.

03:25:15.400 --> 03:25:16.400
We'll be back though.

03:25:16.400 --> 03:25:19.200
If you are listening live or on podcasts or whatever, we still got the marathon coming

03:25:19.200 --> 03:25:21.560
up and plenty more show.

03:25:21.560 --> 03:25:25.300
Um, who knows what randomness is going to happen when we don't have a chat room going

03:25:25.300 --> 03:25:26.300
on here.

03:25:26.300 --> 03:25:31.240
The folks in chat are saying good night and they're waving even though you can't see them

03:25:31.240 --> 03:25:35.920
and I'm getting everything up from, uh, let's see.

03:25:35.920 --> 03:25:39.680
Toa gax says, if my IRC was server was up, I would let them bounce IRC off of me.

03:25:39.680 --> 03:25:40.680
Oh, that's a good idea.

03:25:40.680 --> 03:25:44.800
Somebody should put up like a fake fake server that we can go on and at least see our chat

03:25:44.800 --> 03:25:45.800
room still.

03:25:45.800 --> 03:25:46.800
Yeah.

03:25:46.800 --> 03:25:49.160
My roommate has a, um, Linux box running in the spare bedroom.

03:25:49.160 --> 03:25:50.160
Oh really?

03:25:50.160 --> 03:25:52.200
So I could shell into that and we can see from there.

03:25:52.200 --> 03:25:55.600
That might be a good idea, but I'm not going to worry about it too much.

03:25:55.600 --> 03:25:56.600
It's just an hour, right?

03:25:56.600 --> 03:25:58.160
We can make it an hour.

03:25:58.160 --> 03:25:59.160
We can do it.

03:25:59.160 --> 03:26:03.360
All right, we're going to play our outro, say good night and we'll be back though with

03:26:03.360 --> 03:26:06.000
more of the OLR marathon right after this.

03:26:06.000 --> 03:26:10.040
You've been listening to orange lounge radio.

03:26:10.040 --> 03:26:15.560
Orange lounge radio is an orange lounge production to join us for a live show.

03:26:15.560 --> 03:26:24.240
Visit www.allgames.com Sunday nights at 6 PM Pacific time, the views and opinions expressed

03:26:24.240 --> 03:26:29.120

03:26:29.120 --> 03:26:34.080
lounge radio or all games.com, but we're probably right anyway.
