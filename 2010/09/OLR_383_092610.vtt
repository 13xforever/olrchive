Good.

01:04.280 --> 01:05.280
Crunchy the Bagel Queen.

01:05.280 --> 01:07.040
Okay, can that be your new name tonight?

01:07.040 --> 01:08.360
Crunchy the Bagel Queen?

01:08.360 --> 01:09.360
No.

01:09.360 --> 01:10.360
Please?

01:10.360 --> 01:11.360
No.

01:11.360 --> 01:12.360
Okay.

01:12.360 --> 01:13.360
Also joining us, say hello to Tech Master Loki.

01:13.360 --> 01:14.360
Hello.

01:14.360 --> 01:15.360
How are you doing Tech Master Loki?

01:15.360 --> 01:16.360
I'm doing fine.

01:16.360 --> 01:17.360
Good.

01:17.360 --> 01:19.480
See, I remembered your guys' names even though Crunchy the Bagel Queen wants to go buy something

01:19.480 --> 01:20.480
else tonight.

01:20.480 --> 01:24.400
Alright, also, I just got the finger, alright.

01:24.400 --> 01:27.520
Also say hello to special guests we have in the studio tonight.

01:27.520 --> 01:32.940
In fact, they had so much fun last week, they're back for more, suckers.

01:32.940 --> 01:40.240
Say hello to the Doctor and, okay, and Rice Princess.

01:40.240 --> 01:45.140
I like that you're psychic to the point where you can't remember your own name.

01:45.140 --> 01:46.140
That's wonderful.

01:46.140 --> 01:50.440
Okay, she's referencing a phone call we just, okay, every week on the, just for those that

01:50.440 --> 01:54.360
only download the podcast and don't listen live, every week we do a phone call before

01:54.360 --> 01:58.700
the show is live with Bobby Blackwolf, the gentleman who does the show before us.

01:58.700 --> 02:03.920
And I don't know, I claim to have ESP or something, but Loki was actually reading Bobby's mind,

02:03.920 --> 02:04.920
not mine.

02:04.920 --> 02:05.920
I don't know.

02:05.920 --> 02:06.920
It was dumb.

02:06.920 --> 02:07.920
Like even repeating the story is really dumb.

02:07.920 --> 02:08.920
Wouldn't that mean I have ESP?

02:08.920 --> 02:11.480
That's because you're psycho and have ESPN.

02:11.480 --> 02:13.040
This is really, really dumb.

02:13.040 --> 02:14.040
For real.

02:14.040 --> 02:15.040
For real, real.

02:15.040 --> 02:16.040
For real.

02:16.040 --> 02:17.040
Alright.

02:17.040 --> 02:20.160
Rob, it's for reals, okay.

02:20.160 --> 02:25.720
Chat.orangelaunchrater.com if you want to join us live and chat with us tonight.

02:25.720 --> 02:30.120
You got a fan in chat, Darkisque's in chat saying, Rice Princess, we loves you.

02:30.120 --> 02:31.120
Aw, thanks.

02:31.120 --> 02:33.680
I love you too, whoever you are.

02:33.680 --> 02:34.680
You don't even know him.

02:34.680 --> 02:35.680
No, I really don't.

02:35.680 --> 02:36.680
But thank you.

02:36.680 --> 02:37.680
I like you too.

02:37.680 --> 02:42.880
Rama says, I thought tonight was a repeat as many times as Jamie said crunchy lol.

02:42.880 --> 02:49.200
No, it's, we're live here on this lovely September evening of 2008, no, I'm kidding.

02:49.200 --> 02:50.200
Alright.

02:50.200 --> 02:55.760
It's 2010 of course, we're live and we're going to talk about all the latest and greatest

02:55.760 --> 02:57.120
in video games and all that.

02:57.120 --> 02:59.880
But of course we're going to start off the show as we always do with a little bit of

02:59.880 --> 03:01.800
how was your gaming week?

03:01.800 --> 03:02.800
Dark Sakura?

03:02.800 --> 03:03.800
Crunchy the bagel queen?

03:03.800 --> 03:05.500
How was your, how was your gaming week?

03:05.500 --> 03:08.080
I love Plants vs. Zombies a lot.

03:08.080 --> 03:12.320
Like I was supposed to go to bed at midnight a couple nights ago, so I was going to Apple

03:12.320 --> 03:13.320
Hill on the weekend.

03:13.320 --> 03:14.320
Okay, your mic is full of fail.

03:14.320 --> 03:15.320
You gotta grab it.

03:15.320 --> 03:16.320
Okay.

03:16.320 --> 03:17.320
I got it.

03:17.320 --> 03:18.320
Alright.

03:18.320 --> 03:19.320
Nothing ever.

03:19.320 --> 03:24.200
I had to go to bed early one night and cause we were going to Apple Hill the next day,

03:24.200 --> 03:27.880
which is awesome and has lots of apple juice.

03:27.880 --> 03:29.760
Apple Hill's awesome.

03:29.760 --> 03:30.760
Yes.

03:30.760 --> 03:37.940
Anyway, um, but instead of going to bed on time when I was supposed to, I was up for

03:37.940 --> 03:41.440
three hours playing Plants vs. Zombies and didn't even realize how late I was up playing

03:41.440 --> 03:44.840
Plants vs. Zombies and did it again yesterday.

03:44.840 --> 03:45.900
And I love that game.

03:45.900 --> 03:51.720
Plants vs. Zombies is freaking rad and then I played some Final Fantasy 13.

03:51.720 --> 03:54.380
How many times can this dude say hero?

03:54.380 --> 04:00.080
For those of, you know, our listeners that aren't local to the Sacramento area, Apple

04:00.080 --> 04:06.920
Hill is a place a little bit up, um, I guess a little Eastern from us, um, it's Camino

04:06.920 --> 04:12.720
California up the hill, I guess if you will, um, where they have a lot of apples and crafts

04:12.720 --> 04:18.960
and stuff and, um, I mean the apple cider's awesome, but apple cider's, you know, awesome

04:18.960 --> 04:22.240
all the time, but it's crafts.

04:22.240 --> 04:25.680
No, they have lots of good organic markets there.

04:25.680 --> 04:26.680
And a corn maze.

04:26.680 --> 04:30.280
But, but, they don't have a corn maze.

04:30.280 --> 04:31.280
They're just no corn.

04:31.280 --> 04:33.320
Is that a maze maze?

04:33.320 --> 04:36.440
They had a corn maze when I went there like years ago, like 10 years ago.

04:36.440 --> 04:38.560
Well I had never been, okay?

04:38.560 --> 04:41.480
I'm from Alabama where we have stuff like swamps.

04:41.480 --> 04:49.760
Um, swamp hill, but they've got craft, the blueberry swamp is, there was a place there

04:49.760 --> 04:54.400
that had a really good lamb burger of which I got lamb burger juice all over my hands

04:54.400 --> 04:56.000
and wiped it off on a lamb.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.760
Is there, is there a lamb?

04:57.760 --> 04:59.040
That is sick.

04:59.040 --> 05:01.800
PETA is going to be calling any minute now.

05:01.800 --> 05:02.880
Here's your sister.

05:02.880 --> 05:03.880
Come here.

05:03.880 --> 05:04.880
That's gross.

05:04.880 --> 05:11.920
And for the record, I went shopping at the organic market up there and I picked heirloom

05:11.920 --> 05:15.680
tomatoes, fell down the hill.

05:15.680 --> 05:16.920
My knee looks better than it did.

05:16.920 --> 05:18.200
You took a tumble down apple hill.

05:18.200 --> 05:23.640
Well, it was funny is that this is the awesome part.

05:23.640 --> 05:28.080
This was the awesome part was that I, uh, when I fell on my knees, I really bruised

05:28.080 --> 05:30.600
up my knee really bad, but I did not tear my jeans.

05:30.600 --> 05:34.600
So you were a bruised apple hill.

05:34.600 --> 05:35.600
She peels.

05:35.600 --> 05:36.600
I'll be here all night, everybody.

05:36.600 --> 05:37.600
But a bump.

05:37.600 --> 05:42.600
Don't forget to tip your waitress.

05:42.600 --> 05:43.600
Okay.

05:43.600 --> 05:44.600
Indeed.

05:44.600 --> 05:48.980
So I love how your gaming week is like, yeah, I play plan for zombies and a little more

05:48.980 --> 05:53.040
fun fancy 13 and Oh my God, apples, apples, apples, apples, apples, and I'm not talking

05:53.040 --> 05:54.040
max.

05:54.040 --> 05:55.040
I got fudge.

05:55.040 --> 05:56.040
Oh, congrats.

05:56.040 --> 05:59.380
They do have an apple cider milkshake.

05:59.380 --> 06:00.380
That's pretty good though.

06:00.380 --> 06:07.680
We had lunch at the place has had the apple milkshakes and it's so good video games are

06:07.680 --> 06:08.680
pretty cool.

06:08.680 --> 06:09.800
Let's go to apple hill and pack some fudge.

06:09.800 --> 06:11.880
Just like crunchy, the bagel queen.

06:11.880 --> 06:14.000
We don't need to go to apple hill to do that.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
All right.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
All right.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
You guys have earned it.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.880
Hold on.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.400
What I love is that your mic is so crappy.

06:21.400 --> 06:22.400
It won't pick that thing up.

06:22.400 --> 06:23.400
Anyway.

06:23.400 --> 06:24.400
All right.

06:24.400 --> 06:25.400
My mic is not crappy.

06:25.400 --> 06:28.920
It's the swear bear in you have a swear bear.

06:28.920 --> 06:31.600
What is a swear bear?

06:31.600 --> 06:37.880
It's a bear that makes really obscene comments and it has two different settings on the back

06:37.880 --> 06:42.140
of it has a switch, which I thought was an on off switch and for the longest time kept

06:42.140 --> 06:47.120
saying kiss my ass instead of like all the, instead of all the wonderful things he normally

06:47.120 --> 06:52.600
says, but like he will say of course kiss my ass and he'll say, um, eat shit and die

06:52.600 --> 06:57.200
motherfucker, you know, but I have it on my desk and it just, it's a really cute looking

06:57.200 --> 07:02.000
bear that says, hug me or press press me and like it's chest and some people are like,

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
Oh, it's a bear.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.480
What the fuck did they just say to me?

07:06.480 --> 07:07.480
I know.

07:07.480 --> 07:08.480
Seriously.

07:08.480 --> 07:09.480
Why do we not have a swear bear here in the studio?

07:09.480 --> 07:10.480
I will bring it in next week.

07:10.480 --> 07:11.480
You know what?

07:11.480 --> 07:12.480
I'm not going to be here next week.

07:12.480 --> 07:13.480
So I think that's too bad.

07:13.480 --> 07:14.480
Why don't you have the swear?

07:14.480 --> 07:15.920
Why don't you have the swear bear sit in for me next week?

07:15.920 --> 07:16.920
I'm sorry.

07:16.920 --> 07:17.920
I ate it.

07:17.920 --> 07:18.920
Okay.

07:18.920 --> 07:19.920
So.

07:19.920 --> 07:20.920
Sure.

07:20.920 --> 07:21.920
Loki.

07:21.920 --> 07:23.920
How was your gaming week?

07:23.920 --> 07:28.880
Um, it was pretty brief cause I don't have a lot of time and place of at home, but, um,

07:28.880 --> 07:31.960
you know, I've been playing a lot of iPod games and stuff.

07:31.960 --> 07:33.400
Uh, well, okay.

07:33.400 --> 07:36.080
Really only one iPod game and playing plants versus zombies.

07:36.080 --> 07:38.000
Uh, I can't help it.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
It's so addicting.

07:39.000 --> 07:44.200
Um, but yeah, it's, it's an awesome game, so you should get it really on any platform

07:44.200 --> 07:45.840
that you can.

07:45.840 --> 07:51.840
Um, then also of course more grand theft auto and that was pretty much it.

07:51.840 --> 07:53.240
It's, I don't know.

07:53.240 --> 07:54.240
It's fun.

07:54.240 --> 07:59.720
We went back, like I said, to, uh, the Lost and Damned expansion and, um, I kinda, I kinda

07:59.720 --> 08:04.000
missed the old, uh, open world actual death matches and stuff instead of being confined

08:04.000 --> 08:05.960
to a really small portion of the map.

08:05.960 --> 08:09.920
So it's kinda nice to do that and we're gonna be modding it again soon.

08:09.920 --> 08:13.760
So we'll be back to the incredible games that we used to play.

08:13.760 --> 08:18.960
Um, and then since she brought up something completely unrelated to the games, I thought

08:18.960 --> 08:23.320
I'd bring something up that, you know, totally missed the boat on, like, years ago when it

08:23.320 --> 08:24.320
came out.

08:24.320 --> 08:27.320
But, um, this morning I actually watched that movie, uh, Shoot Em Up.

08:27.320 --> 08:29.080
That movie is fucking crazy.

08:29.080 --> 08:31.080
Oh, I don't know.

08:31.080 --> 08:36.920
Um, I've never seen a person kill more people with a carrot than, you know, in that movie.

08:36.920 --> 08:41.720
He, he murdered literally, like, 12 to 15 people with a carrot.

08:41.720 --> 08:43.840
It didn't, like, break at any point?

08:43.840 --> 08:44.840
No, different carrots.

08:44.840 --> 08:45.840
Oh.

08:45.840 --> 08:47.320
He, like, you know, shoved one through a guy's throat.

08:47.320 --> 08:49.600
He stabbed a person in the eye with a carrot.

08:49.600 --> 08:54.600
It was just, it was so, the movie, it, from the beginning, was just so over the top.

08:54.600 --> 08:56.520
What the fuck movie is this?

08:56.520 --> 09:00.840
It's with, um, oh, what the fuck is his name, uh.

09:00.840 --> 09:03.720
That actor that nobody knows.

09:03.720 --> 09:04.720
I don't know.

09:04.720 --> 09:05.720
Yeah, I can't think of any.

09:05.720 --> 09:08.240
That guy who did that thing in that place.

09:08.240 --> 09:09.640
Yeah.

09:09.640 --> 09:13.920
But no, it's a really, um, really just over the top movie.

09:13.920 --> 09:18.240
If they spend, like, two minutes where it's just kinda, okay, normal, and then it's just,

09:18.240 --> 09:20.120
like, boom, all action, just all the time.

09:20.120 --> 09:21.120
Like, over the top.

09:21.120 --> 09:22.120
Over the top action.

09:22.120 --> 09:23.120
Just gratuitous.

09:23.120 --> 09:26.080
They're having sex in a gunfight at the same time.

09:26.080 --> 09:32.840
I mean, there's, oh, there, there's parts where he is, um, he was doing something with

09:32.840 --> 09:33.840
a baby.

09:33.840 --> 09:34.840
Oh.

09:34.840 --> 09:35.840
Oh my.

09:35.840 --> 09:39.880
Shoot Em Up is a 2007 action film starring Clive Owen, Clive Owen, Paul Giamatti, and

09:39.880 --> 09:40.880
Monica Bellucci.

09:40.880 --> 09:42.240
She was the hot chick in The Matrix, huh?

09:42.240 --> 09:44.600
And she was the hot chick in that movie, too.

09:44.600 --> 09:50.120
She was a, she was a lactating prostitute that he brought the baby to, to feed.

09:50.120 --> 09:51.120
Wow.

09:51.120 --> 09:52.560
Sounds like a real family fun film.

09:52.560 --> 09:54.240
No, it's awesome, though.

09:54.240 --> 10:00.200
Seriously, it is, like, such an awesome movie, and I do idolize the fact that he killed people

10:00.200 --> 10:01.200
that annoyed him.

10:01.200 --> 10:04.600
Like, he's all, you know, my pet pet, like, there's, like, one part, after a gunfight,

10:04.600 --> 10:08.000
they're, like, getting away from these bad guys, and this guy cuts them off without,

10:08.000 --> 10:10.680
you know, he's merged lanes without signaling.

10:10.680 --> 10:14.960
So he chased the guy down, slammed him off the road, and then, you know, made him get

10:14.960 --> 10:15.960
in a car accident.

10:15.960 --> 10:19.880
There was some other guy that was slurping a, you know, milkshake, he shot the milkshake.

10:19.880 --> 10:24.560
Another guy that had, like, really nasty-looking toenails, so he blew off his toes.

10:24.560 --> 10:26.000
Of course, they were holding up.

10:26.000 --> 10:31.200
I could have swore that Loki said, let's talk about actual video games this week.

10:31.200 --> 10:32.200
Yeah, but then he said.

10:32.200 --> 10:33.200
I did!

10:33.200 --> 10:34.200
For, like, five seconds.

10:34.200 --> 10:35.200
This is his Apple Hill moment.

10:35.200 --> 10:36.200
Just give it to him, Rob.

10:36.200 --> 10:37.200
Geez.

10:37.200 --> 10:40.600
No, seriously, I mean, I totally missed this when it came out in theaters, but, you know,

10:40.600 --> 10:45.840
it was, like, on DVD and Blu-ray and stuff like that, until it was on, you know, cable

10:45.840 --> 10:46.840
TV.

10:46.840 --> 10:49.640
No, seriously, it's such an awesome movie.

10:49.640 --> 10:50.640
Just way over the top.

10:50.640 --> 10:54.840
I don't understand why it didn't do better than it did in the box office, because it

10:54.840 --> 10:57.840
was just such a crazy movie.

10:57.840 --> 11:03.720
If I'm understanding this correctly, he's killing anyone that even slightly annoys him?

11:03.720 --> 11:09.400
Like, there's no anger issues at all in this movie.

11:09.400 --> 11:16.440
Not everybody, but, like, usually it's like, you know, just, I don't know, it's just lots

11:16.440 --> 11:21.540
of funny one-liners in there, and just really ridiculous stuff, you know, at one point he

11:21.540 --> 11:25.680
gets both of his thumbs broken, and he's, like, firing the gun in really weird ways.

11:25.680 --> 11:30.220
He uses the carrot a lot, like, he uses the carrot to fire the gun, he jams a carrot into

11:30.220 --> 11:35.920
the trigger of an Uzi and throws the Uzi, like, at the bad guys, and it's just, it's

11:35.920 --> 11:36.920
so ridiculous.

11:36.920 --> 11:40.920
Oh, there's one scene in the warehouse where he rigs this elaborate pulley system with

11:40.920 --> 11:44.400
all these guns, and, like, they're coming after him, he's watching them on security

11:44.400 --> 11:49.160
cameras and firing different guns in remote places, it's just ridiculous, but it would

11:49.160 --> 11:51.120
make such an awesome video game.

11:51.120 --> 11:52.120
Yeah, and this is called when?

11:52.120 --> 11:53.760
And that's how we bring it back.

11:53.760 --> 11:55.160
And this is called again?

11:55.160 --> 11:56.160
Shoot Em Up.

11:56.160 --> 11:57.160
Shoot Em Up.

11:57.160 --> 11:59.160
That sounds like a lot of video games, actually.

11:59.160 --> 12:04.040
No, seriously, I think it was, like, one of the most incredible movies I've ever seen.

12:04.040 --> 12:08.240
I mean, I think it even surpasses, like, Wanted for me, you know, because Wanted I thought

12:08.240 --> 12:11.760
was a pretty awesome action movie, but this is just ridiculous.

12:11.760 --> 12:14.200
This is, like, big hit ridiculous and then some.

12:14.200 --> 12:16.040
I love the big hit.

12:16.040 --> 12:18.040
Oh, that movie is ridiculous.

12:18.040 --> 12:19.040
All right, wow.

12:19.040 --> 12:20.920
Back to Shoot Em Up Radio.

12:20.920 --> 12:22.720
I have a torrent ready.

12:22.720 --> 12:23.720
Okay.

12:23.720 --> 12:27.640
I mean, I have a YouTube clips of it ready.

12:27.640 --> 12:28.760
Of course.

12:28.760 --> 12:29.760
My Gaming Week.

12:29.760 --> 12:31.920
Today, I actually played Plants vs. Zombies.

12:31.920 --> 12:32.920
I'm not even kidding.

12:32.920 --> 12:34.200
I played for, like, five minutes.

12:34.200 --> 12:36.200
Oh, wow, is there an echo in the room?

12:36.200 --> 12:37.200
Um, yeah.

12:37.200 --> 12:38.200
Other games I played this week.

12:38.200 --> 12:41.760
I played a little more of Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light because I hadn't really

12:41.760 --> 12:45.360
played it since the week it came out and I was like, oh, I want to beat more of it because

12:45.360 --> 12:46.360
it's such a cool game.

12:46.360 --> 12:47.360
So I want to play more of that.

12:47.360 --> 12:48.360
So I did.

12:48.360 --> 12:49.360
What?

12:49.360 --> 12:50.360
What's that?

12:50.360 --> 12:51.360
Sorry.

12:51.360 --> 12:52.360
I remembered another game I played.

12:52.360 --> 12:53.920
Is she just going to cut me off for your game?

12:53.920 --> 12:54.920
I see how it is.

12:54.920 --> 12:55.920
Sorry.

12:55.920 --> 12:56.920
Well, you mentioned you made me think about it.

12:56.920 --> 12:57.920
Fine.

12:57.920 --> 12:58.920
What?

12:58.920 --> 12:59.920
Droplets.

12:59.920 --> 13:00.920
The hell's that?

13:00.920 --> 13:01.920
It's a little puzzle game on Steam.

13:01.920 --> 13:02.920
$2.

13:02.920 --> 13:04.240
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

13:04.240 --> 13:05.240
You know what?

13:05.240 --> 13:07.480
I've got to go play that, too, because I got gifted a copy of that.

13:07.480 --> 13:08.480
Yeah.

13:08.480 --> 13:09.480
So I got to check that out.

13:09.480 --> 13:10.480
I just didn't this week.

13:10.480 --> 13:11.480
You should think about-

13:11.480 --> 13:12.480
It's actually fun.

13:12.480 --> 13:13.480
I'll check it out.

13:13.480 --> 13:15.320
I've heard good things about it.

13:15.320 --> 13:19.120
You should think about fitting Earthbound into there somewhere, Rob.

13:19.120 --> 13:20.120
At some point.

13:20.120 --> 13:21.120
Yes.

13:21.120 --> 13:22.120
I know.

13:22.120 --> 13:23.120
Yes.

13:23.120 --> 13:24.120
You're a little behind, like, many years.

13:24.120 --> 13:25.120
Stop.

13:25.120 --> 13:27.600
And, let's see, I played World of Warcraft a lot because it's awesome.

13:27.600 --> 13:28.600
Dork.

13:28.600 --> 13:29.600
Shut up.

13:29.600 --> 13:30.600
You played, too.

13:30.600 --> 13:31.600
Shut up.

13:31.600 --> 13:32.600
I played something new.

13:32.600 --> 13:36.760
I played Need for Speed World, which is the free MMO, because it's free.

13:36.760 --> 13:37.840
It's an MMO?

13:37.840 --> 13:40.640
It's a free Need for Speed MMO.

13:40.640 --> 13:42.400
It came up on the show a couple of weeks ago.

13:42.400 --> 13:43.400
I have to know.

13:43.400 --> 13:44.400
What do you do?

13:44.400 --> 13:45.400
Do you just race against people?

13:45.400 --> 13:48.960
To be honest, it really isn't much different from a Need for Speed game on, like, Xbox

13:48.960 --> 13:49.960
360.

13:49.960 --> 13:51.880
At least that's how it felt to me, is just that, you know, other people would show up

13:51.880 --> 13:52.880
in races.

13:52.880 --> 13:54.560
It was like, okay, you remember Test Drive on the 360?

13:54.560 --> 13:58.120
I don't know if you ever played it, but you would just see other people as you're driving

13:58.120 --> 13:59.900
by in the world.

13:59.900 --> 14:03.480
Like you'd just kind of drive by them and there'd be, like, actual people on their 360s

14:03.480 --> 14:04.960
out on the road that you'd be driving by.

14:04.960 --> 14:08.580
Except none of them were me, because if they were me, I'd be driving off-road because that's

14:08.580 --> 14:09.580
all I did with those cars.

14:09.580 --> 14:11.640
Well, you sometimes see people doing that, too.

14:11.640 --> 14:15.760
It's pretty much like that, but, like, it's kind of such a clusterfuck that, like, in

14:15.760 --> 14:20.400
the first couple, like, I guess around a race or something, there's no collision detection

14:20.400 --> 14:24.820
because, like, seriously, there'll be, like, 20 cars piled up where all the cars happen

14:24.820 --> 14:28.780
to start, so it looks kind of funny with all these names.

14:28.780 --> 14:31.320
So I didn't really get the MMO part of it, but...

14:31.320 --> 14:33.000
And the cops are very dumb in that game.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.560
Well, but as a free need...

14:34.560 --> 14:35.920
They can't figure out how to get you off-road.

14:35.920 --> 14:37.240
It's like, where'd he go?

14:37.240 --> 14:40.520
Hold on, though, because I don't want to sound like I'm talking negative about the game,

14:40.520 --> 14:44.800
because let's not neglect the fact it is a free need-for-speed game.

14:44.800 --> 14:49.920
I didn't pay anything for it, and it's totally free, so hey, you know, it's really hard for

14:49.920 --> 14:54.640
me to sit here and say, you know, talk bad about a free game, because it actually was

14:54.640 --> 14:55.640
pretty decent.

14:55.640 --> 14:59.520
And the only free games I can think of that I can talk bad about are Yaris, of course,

14:59.520 --> 15:00.520
Totem Ball.

15:00.520 --> 15:01.520
That was really bad.

15:01.520 --> 15:03.420
I mean, there's only a handful, so...

15:03.420 --> 15:06.720
But this is worth your time to look, especially if you're, like, a fan of racing games or

15:06.720 --> 15:08.240
you like need-for-speed.

15:08.240 --> 15:12.400
It plays a lot like one of the Xbox games that I've played in the past, so...

15:12.400 --> 15:13.400
Oh.

15:13.400 --> 15:14.400
Yeah, why not?

15:14.400 --> 15:15.400
All right.

15:15.400 --> 15:16.400
Check that out.

15:16.400 --> 15:17.400
Cool.

15:17.400 --> 15:18.400
Other than that, not a whole lot.

15:18.400 --> 15:21.600
I was playing some new iPhone games, because who doesn't love iPhone games?

15:21.600 --> 15:22.600
The Game Center games.

15:22.600 --> 15:27.240
There's a game in there called Word Challenge, and I was a little scared at first because

15:27.240 --> 15:28.840
it's by Zynga.

15:28.840 --> 15:30.720
Because there's words in it, and I was really scared.

15:30.720 --> 15:31.720
I know.

15:31.720 --> 15:33.760
I was like, oh, but I'm illiterate.

15:33.760 --> 15:35.560
But I actually thought it's...

15:35.560 --> 15:36.640
It's basically Boggle.

15:36.640 --> 15:38.080
You know the old game with Dias Boggle?

15:38.080 --> 15:39.080
I do.

15:39.080 --> 15:41.840
But it's free, and you can play online, and there's challenges, and it's...

15:41.840 --> 15:42.840
Did I mention free?

15:42.840 --> 15:43.840
The free part's good.

15:43.840 --> 15:47.120
So is that why it's called Word Challenge?

15:47.120 --> 15:48.120
Word Challenge?

15:48.120 --> 15:49.120
Yes, because it involves words.

15:49.120 --> 15:50.120
And it's challenging.

15:50.120 --> 15:51.120
Okay.

15:51.120 --> 15:55.720
It's challenging, because some of these words, I'm like, I never knew that was a word.

15:55.720 --> 15:56.720
Like the?

15:56.720 --> 15:57.720
Like what?

15:57.720 --> 15:58.720
I don't know.

15:58.720 --> 15:59.720
What does that mean?

15:59.720 --> 16:00.720
You want to play around on here?

16:00.720 --> 16:01.720
You made that word up.

16:01.720 --> 16:04.680
Every obscure three-letter word.

16:04.680 --> 16:05.680
You know.

16:05.680 --> 16:06.680
That's like playing Scrabble Solitaire.

16:06.680 --> 16:07.680
What does it all mean?

16:07.680 --> 16:08.680
I guess.

16:08.680 --> 16:09.680
I don't know.

16:09.680 --> 16:10.680
I could go in and look up some obscure words.

16:10.680 --> 16:12.320
They have that one game that's on the App Store now.

16:12.320 --> 16:16.400
It's like some pirate version of Scrabble, where all the words are like R.

16:16.400 --> 16:21.440
There's only so many words you can do in pirate-speak.

16:21.440 --> 16:24.700
R, and then Rrrrrrrrrrr?

16:24.700 --> 16:26.080
No, but that's literally what it was.

16:26.080 --> 16:27.640
Yeah, it was literally that.

16:27.640 --> 16:30.900
It was kind of a joke for Talk Like a Pirate Day or whatever.

16:30.900 --> 16:32.340
Oh, I see.

16:32.340 --> 16:34.360
Ooooh, why do you know that?

16:34.360 --> 16:37.920
Let's see, I'm actually launching the game right now so I can read some of the obscure

16:37.920 --> 16:38.920
words.

16:38.920 --> 16:42.860
I'm going into the challenges, because X-Link dared to send me some challenges.

16:42.860 --> 16:44.460
And I whooped him.

16:44.460 --> 16:45.460
But...

16:45.460 --> 16:54.040
let's see what are some of the wagers eager look at some of the like like

16:54.040 --> 16:57.240
these aren't words you think of like as you're playing these days let me look at

16:57.240 --> 17:03.160
some of like okay you're eager that's not a word it is a word according it's

17:03.160 --> 17:12.240
bad English it's like you're eager t-w-a-e-t way I've never I was what

17:12.240 --> 17:19.460
wait w-a-e-t way like I did you say I see tire and I see twas and I get those like

17:19.460 --> 17:23.540
twas the night before Christmas but way I've never heard of that and I almost

17:23.540 --> 17:31.580
said twig but I know how to toy gives um what's a Vega V IGA Vega I don't know

17:31.580 --> 17:38.860
that sounds dirty a Vega I think it's like it sounds like part of a word like

17:38.860 --> 17:43.740
vegetable vagina okay the definition of Vega one of the heavy rafters and

17:43.740 --> 17:47.060
especially a log supporting the roof of an American Indian or Spanish

17:47.060 --> 17:52.220
architecture of the southwest cuz I fucking know Spanish architect Jesus

17:52.220 --> 17:58.300
don't you feel sheepish now I do don't know that word all right you're more

17:58.300 --> 18:07.260
eager and what is the Scottish variant of two oh so fucking Scottish words are

18:07.260 --> 18:12.100
in the game I guess word would be banned and scrabble just saying alright so

18:12.100 --> 18:15.660
anyway that's my playing that's my one problem with this game is that just like

18:15.660 --> 18:18.620
totally you could just drag your finger around the board and connect three

18:18.620 --> 18:23.660
letters as long as there's a value probably have a word so if you might be

18:23.660 --> 18:33.060
able to make a word out of nothing but vowels actually alright how about the

my gaming week in action you need to get a little like one of those like books to

19:48.060 --> 19:52.420
read in bed I need to get one of those little books you know that's what

19:52.420 --> 19:57.060
they're called right but well I think that any reader device or something like

19:57.060 --> 20:00.580
an iPhone or a Kindle or something and then I'm like one of those things with

20:00.580 --> 20:06.980
paper and words but then I'm like I'm like look at this game and see if books

20:06.980 --> 20:09.740
is you didn't let me finish my thought but no I was like oh rice princesses

20:09.740 --> 20:13.980
poor so I price just leave it for you fucker

20:13.980 --> 20:19.060
rub it in my face loves you well you can just take junk mail staple it together

20:19.060 --> 20:26.020
and pretend it's a book books I have to buy like $500 books for school I should

20:26.020 --> 20:32.140
probably read them but no I won't book should be $500 I mean I realize that you

20:32.140 --> 20:36.100
realize that yeah publishing companies are like well we can't make money on the

20:36.100 --> 20:40.300
books we have to keep re-releasing the same crap in church $500 well and plus

20:40.300 --> 20:43.420
they're not giving a discount on the iBooks and stuff now which I think is

20:43.420 --> 20:50.340
ridiculous for schools well I prefer like paper books anyway so it seems to

20:50.340 --> 20:52.860
me though that they should be given since they're not distributing the paper

20:52.860 --> 20:56.380
they should give a discount some of the books end up being cheaper anyway though

20:56.380 --> 21:03.380
I've gotten a few through Amazon that are just end up being something like

21:03.380 --> 21:07.820
maybe $30 cheaper than my old textbook for the Kindle well I use the Kindle app

21:07.820 --> 21:14.140
on my phone hmm so then like it's a lot better than bringing a whole big book

21:14.140 --> 21:20.220
with me I actually bought a book in iBooks this week iPhone no it's like a

21:20.220 --> 21:25.700
real is this the first time you bought a book in like 30 years probably no I buy

21:25.700 --> 21:30.220
books here and there but Judy Bloom it was not a shitty balloon book screen it

21:30.220 --> 21:33.940
was actually a political book which one I know weird I don't want to get into it

21:33.940 --> 21:40.500
because okay politics is controversial like a Playboy app on there and the

21:40.500 --> 21:44.340
problem is it's like everything in Playboy other than the nudity and it's

21:44.340 --> 21:48.700
like no one wants to read that nobody it's like wait a minute post

21:48.700 --> 21:55.580
advertisement man where are the titties but no it's just articles so that was my

21:55.580 --> 22:01.780
gaming week awesome yeah sounds like fun it was all right now before we get into

22:01.780 --> 22:06.220
some gaming news of yes we we do have some on the show housekeeping I'm not

can find us on Twitter lots of fun any housekeeping you want to add rice

22:36.300 --> 22:40.940
princess no okay all right let's get into some gaming news Loki you want to

22:40.940 --> 22:45.620
start us off tonight apparently I GM claims to have received technical specs

22:45.620 --> 22:53.140
for the Nintendo DS 3ds Nintendo DS we know what's in it now years after it's

22:53.140 --> 22:59.260
come out stickers and puppies in myspace.com ah let's see apparently the

22:59.260 --> 23:06.700
handheld system will be using the DMP pick a 200 GPU wow that's impressive

23:06.700 --> 23:12.100
except I don't know what it is um running as slowed down 166 megahertz

23:12.100 --> 23:18.340
along with two arm 11 CPUs running at 266 megahertz and that's a lot of

23:18.340 --> 23:23.740
megahertz right no of course not which of course it doesn't seem to back the

23:23.740 --> 23:29.700
rumor that it was running the Nvidia Tegra chips and it says according to IGN

23:29.700 --> 23:35.460
as well they will also have a looks like a gig and a half of flash memory for

23:35.460 --> 23:41.460
storage much like the DS eyes do now except you know a little bit more

23:41.460 --> 23:45.060
apparently numerous developers are working on software for the platform

23:45.060 --> 23:51.060
obviously since they showed a bunch of stuff at e3 anyways and said that

23:51.060 --> 23:54.420
they've likened the graphical capabilities to current generation

23:54.420 --> 23:59.500
consoles like Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 albeit on smaller lower resolution

23:59.500 --> 24:07.020
screens that's Connie and apparently I guess it's only gonna have 64 megs of

24:07.020 --> 24:12.300
RAM which doesn't really compare you know favorably to like you know the

24:12.300 --> 24:17.500
iPhones half a gig see that's what I don't understand is why they can't put

24:17.500 --> 24:21.780
more RAM in these things I mean because RAM isn't that expensive and you know

24:21.780 --> 24:28.660
kind of sucks when you don't have enough of it it's just my thought so yeah do

24:28.660 --> 24:34.460
the cartridges not have it on there um no they don't but see that's the other

24:34.460 --> 24:37.540
thing is so I don't understand why you couldn't do that say for example have

24:37.540 --> 24:45.820
more RAM on the cartridge or something I don't know it's kind of dumb like even

24:45.820 --> 24:49.220
when the Xbox 360 came out they have like what like 256 megs of RAM or

24:49.220 --> 24:54.060
something in there I'm like you're releasing a system now that has like 256

24:54.060 --> 24:59.420
megs of RAM when computers have well over that I mean we're not talking like

24:59.420 --> 25:03.940
a computer from say the year 2000 or something I mean we're talking about an

25:03.940 --> 25:09.180
Xbox 360 that's coming out years later and technology has just gotten way

25:09.180 --> 25:14.780
better I mean you have a cutting-edge you know CPU GPU and you know all this

25:14.780 --> 25:18.340
other stuff but oh we're only gonna stick like four megs of RAM in there you

25:18.340 --> 25:23.700
know and we're gonna run DOS or something it's like don't skimp on

25:23.700 --> 25:29.460
important stuff like that but I guess their reasoning behind is that first off

25:29.460 --> 25:36.780
the 3ds doesn't have an iOS or some sort of operating system the hog resources

25:36.780 --> 25:43.620
and also because it's low resolution it's not going to use as much RAM does

25:43.620 --> 25:48.740
it explain how the 3d without glasses works though no 3d without glasses it's

25:48.740 --> 25:57.340
basically like we talked about that like six months ago no it works very much

25:57.340 --> 26:03.540
like those oh and I of course can't remember what they're called now you

26:03.540 --> 26:08.740
have you seen those like for example kind of a hologram things that they have

26:08.740 --> 26:15.780
lenticular it's like a lenticular page or something like that where basically

26:15.780 --> 26:19.720
there's lenses in there that force half the image into one eye and half the

26:19.720 --> 26:23.020
image into the other eye and it makes it seem like it's popping out or not

26:23.020 --> 26:27.940
necessarily popping out but going back in it gives it depth so that's how it

26:27.940 --> 26:33.820
works oh there's actually a person standing behind the DS and like holding

26:33.820 --> 26:40.340
stuff in front of your face tiny tiny digital midget is how it's done mm-hmm

26:40.340 --> 26:47.660
so there will be plenty of sex games on the 3ds then what I would assume so yes

26:47.660 --> 26:56.660
it's powered by the force all right I don't know what powers this game but

26:56.660 --> 27:00.940
there's gonna be a apparently a reboot rumored of Tomb Raider this you know

27:00.940 --> 27:04.500
this has been rumored for some time and it's kind of a duh because you know

27:04.500 --> 27:08.260
Tomb Raider it's been making those games for times now I don't know seriously

27:08.260 --> 27:13.220
well the last one a reboot and then the last one before that a reboot I guess I

27:13.220 --> 27:16.620
don't know but well and then this Laura Croft game was also kind of a reboot but

27:16.620 --> 27:20.300
it was more like let's go this way with it let's make kind of a different game

27:20.300 --> 27:23.780
with the same character it's it's it's kind of different yes it's worked well

27:23.780 --> 27:28.900
all those times well actually some of them weren't bad and this most recent

27:28.900 --> 27:31.620
one the Laura Croft game is the most interesting one I think I've played

27:31.620 --> 27:36.220
since the first two on the PC years ago but they got it right then they wouldn't

27:36.220 --> 27:39.460
be rebooting it every few years well I think there's supposed to be different

27:39.460 --> 27:43.020
different franchises like I think there's gonna be new Laura Croft games

27:43.020 --> 27:47.820
for the arcade download and then the DVD blu-ray games will be these this this

27:47.820 --> 27:52.380
reboot or whatever that's been rumored for some time and in an interview with

27:52.380 --> 27:56.940
I'm sorry not an interview but a report from Eurogamer apparently says that the

27:56.940 --> 28:01.620
latest issue a PC gamer I guess I get their eyes on it first says that the new

28:01.620 --> 28:05.900
Tomb Raider is indeed happening it's supposed to be set on a Japanese island

28:05.900 --> 28:10.820
and it will offer Laura in an open world it's a quote cohesive level with

28:10.820 --> 28:15.740
multiple ways around the puzzles so it's one giant level I guess is how this game

28:15.740 --> 28:19.820
is supposed to work Croft 64 something like that they're gonna say that Laura

28:19.820 --> 28:25.060
is quote younger and inexperienced in the ways of raiding tombs I love that

28:25.060 --> 28:29.940
quote she's inexperienced in raiding tombs she just needs a strong man to

28:29.940 --> 28:37.220
share the way they're guessing holiday 2011 for Xbox 360 PlayStation 3 and PC

28:37.220 --> 28:41.500
notice how I left out the Wii as long as you can lock everybody in the freezer

28:41.500 --> 28:47.940
I'll be happy she looks so mad in that picture but a little picture yeah I you

28:47.940 --> 28:52.900
know obviously I really like the game that was on Xbox so it's kind of the

28:52.900 --> 28:56.860
download that's coming out on the other platforms really soon so if that's kind

28:56.860 --> 29:00.460
of the direction they're going with it I'm I'm all for it although it's not

29:00.460 --> 29:03.220
supposed to be that they've said it's gonna be a completely different kind of

29:03.220 --> 29:07.900
game I guess more like the original but I don't know like the latest game on the

29:07.900 --> 29:13.060
arcade kind of has me excited about Lara Croft again so this could be good I

29:13.060 --> 29:16.500
liked back when the early rumors were suggesting it was more of a survival

29:16.500 --> 29:19.900
horror game like if that's true and I think that's awesome that doesn't even

29:19.900 --> 29:25.420
make sense though how is there a segue between Tomb Raider and then oh did you

29:25.420 --> 29:28.900
ever see the descent the movie the descent did see the where it's all the

29:28.900 --> 29:31.700
chicks in the cave and it's like one of the scariest movies I've ever seen

29:31.700 --> 29:56.220
oh come on I don't think I've ever seen a scarier movie than the descent but it

29:56.220 --> 30:05.020
wasn't that the whole time like I've seen much scarier movies than that like

30:05.020 --> 30:16.300
the Care Bears movie shit was scary man Pokemon three assholes like you know

30:16.300 --> 30:22.860
caverns or something like that fraggle rock the movie give you nightmares it

30:22.860 --> 30:26.740
didn't really give me nightmares it actually like I bet I'm so I'm kind of

30:26.740 --> 30:30.180
sick like it actually made me want to go like explore a cave just so I could get

30:30.180 --> 30:35.900
scared more I want well hold on and now you know though what every gay guy in

30:35.900 --> 30:41.620
Ammon our County does rob rice princess I wanted to go spelunking were you gonna

30:41.620 --> 30:47.700
go I asked spelunking you'll laugh if I tell you the only movie that gave me

30:47.700 --> 30:52.300
nightmares huh poltergeist 3 some of the poltergeist movies were kind of scary it

30:52.300 --> 30:57.660
was the mirrors freaked out over mirrors for like a week I'm not even kidding

30:57.660 --> 31:01.140
about the Care Bears movie like there's this one part where they go into the fun

31:01.140 --> 31:05.660
house and it's like the guy's chasing him and he looks like you know crazy and

31:05.660 --> 31:09.460
I'm just like ah I love it oh no we watched labyrinth last night and I always

31:09.460 --> 31:12.860
get freaked out with the creatures that take their heads off I know they're no

31:12.860 --> 31:15.480
that when I was a little kid I would fast forward through that scene like no

31:15.480 --> 31:21.100
joke scared the crap out of me and you guys are fucking trivializing my

31:21.100 --> 31:26.940
this is have to do a Tomb Raider scary forest and then rice princess and I

31:26.940 --> 31:34.300
earlier we were talking about you know return to Oz and I'm sorry like I don't

31:34.300 --> 31:38.340
know how like any of you that are in like your late 20s early 30s that saw

31:38.340 --> 31:44.420
return to Austin it was in theaters that movie scarred me like it was she had the

31:44.420 --> 31:49.020
fucking head glasses it was scary it was based off the directly off the books

31:49.020 --> 31:53.980
yeah like all you know watered down like the other movie and I think that they

31:53.980 --> 31:58.380
should do more of those types of movies okay I gotta get watered down I gotta go

31:58.380 --> 32:02.180

ship on the on Unicron that was the one that spike said so dark soccer and you

33:56.740 --> 34:01.060
got more gaming news for us Robert Stack was in that in Orson Welles and Leonard

34:01.060 --> 34:07.460
Nimoy hey Orson Welles was there and then he died yeah that's sort of like

34:07.460 --> 34:14.180
what happened to Ralph Julia the one that said the one that said it is even

34:14.180 --> 34:22.740

somebody we need to bring back as a zombie Robert Stack hell yeah okay any

34:34.980 --> 34:42.360
who Atari launched this thing called Atari go and they want to make classic

34:42.360 --> 34:47.100
games good for social gaming ooh

34:47.100 --> 34:54.620
basically Tom Kozak who is the executive VP of online and mobile gaming said that

34:54.620 --> 35:03.100
they're gonna use Atari's catalog and independent developers to I guess provide

35:03.100 --> 35:08.060
more casual and online social gaming basically it's here's our old shit you

35:08.060 --> 35:13.900
don't have an Atari play this and I could go no sir you're wrong I have

35:13.900 --> 35:18.540
several I don't need your online blaming we've played their games on like every

35:18.540 --> 35:23.740
system that's been released ever yay I can play Missile Command again and then

35:23.740 --> 35:27.660
like I could put mr. awesome on my friends list on Facebook and then just

35:27.660 --> 35:31.140
you know get all these little like pokes and graphics about how much better he is

35:31.140 --> 35:35.180
at Missile Command to me why can't we just like have Atari go sit in their

35:35.180 --> 35:41.620
corner and stop putting out their old shit how about Atari no well they're

35:41.620 --> 35:45.460
also though are doing more things for the core games as well like they have a

35:45.460 --> 35:51.300
Facebook tie-in that's going to unlock extra con or might unlock extra content

35:51.300 --> 35:56.180
for test drive unlimited 2 and then asteroids online and deer hunter deer

35:56.180 --> 36:01.420

got to be right I don't know they use they use the word that I hate oh my

36:37.060 --> 36:44.220
microtransactions fun so yeah I will make the most microtransactions

36:44.220 --> 36:48.540
transaction is a trend zero trends but I've been on that site recently I think

36:48.540 --> 36:51.580
after this whole thing launched and like I was able to play Missile Command for

36:51.580 --> 36:56.260
free that some of the newer ones were gonna have the whole microtransaction I

36:56.260 --> 37:00.820
literally played one level and I was like Oh Missile Command back to porn I

37:00.820 --> 37:07.180

37:20.660 --> 37:25.980
me everybody is looking for casual gaming and porn so why not make like a

37:25.980 --> 37:31.300

37:35.260 --> 37:39.340
Command and stuff but they're no they have porn in the background or you know

37:39.340 --> 37:44.020
it's you're playing against porn stars or they're porno things where you have

37:44.020 --> 37:48.580

38:04.480 --> 38:08.140
bought years and years ago for Rob and it was like summer boys something like

38:08.140 --> 38:13.100
that in the back said like watch these boys beat the heat and their meat in

38:13.100 --> 38:18.460
this crazy sex drive bringing this up on our video game talk show that's the best

38:18.460 --> 38:24.860
line I've ever seen on the back of a DVD ever it's why we bought it for you Rob

38:24.860 --> 38:37.180
Wow cuz you like to watch gay porn but Rob so does Jamie but Rob has the

38:37.180 --> 38:44.700
ability to sleep through very noisy gay porn Wow at Disneyland oh yeah I

38:44.700 --> 38:49.180
remember the clincher right there at Disneyland we were we all we all went to

38:49.180 --> 38:55.660
Disneyland on the trip with with the giggling lesbians of orange on radio

38:56.380 --> 39:01.980
story the giggling lesbians of orange it was Kristen and Meg's ego to play Atari

39:01.980 --> 39:10.140
game and then we're all like awake and Rob's like all the girls we had a suite

39:10.140 --> 39:13.980
and it was like the living room with a fold with the height of bed and then

39:13.980 --> 39:17.180
there was a closed-off room with two double beds in it and so Kristin Meg's

39:17.180 --> 39:24.420
he had one and I ignored their slurp you know he says oh my and I was and I was I

39:24.420 --> 39:27.900
was you know so we all wore awake before Rob and Rob's just like dead to the

39:27.900 --> 39:35.140
world and very interesting like with this pillow half over said it was funny

39:35.140 --> 39:39.420
hold on watch if you listen carefully can you hear it yeah you hear all that

39:39.420 --> 39:44.660
clicking yeah that's all the people unsubscribing from all our right now so

39:44.660 --> 39:52.260
so Kristen takes out her laptop this is I brought gay porn and so it's really

39:52.260 --> 40:01.900
loud and she turns up her computer all the way and Rob's just like we let it

40:01.900 --> 40:06.180
play through like the biggest you know this aquatic scene that would make show

40:06.180 --> 40:15.020
girls I don't really be shamed I have one more idea for a game this is

40:15.020 --> 40:19.780
actually not it's not too bad I mean it's all right you know know how they

40:19.780 --> 40:24.980
have that kind of hobby that's geocaching or you know I guess GPS

40:24.980 --> 40:30.260
hunting that type of stuff you call it fine porn or found porn and basically

40:30.260 --> 40:34.620
hide porn around there and mark it on your GPS you know location people can go

40:34.620 --> 40:39.580
find the porn or there could be a naked slut yeah that's way too much work I'm

40:39.580 --> 40:44.140
gonna do that on my computer oh I found porn and I'm gonna watch it that's

40:44.140 --> 40:48.340
that's the new Google Earth a little click you can do like just randomly you

40:48.340 --> 40:52.260
have to search the Google Earth for like random porn place and rent please one

40:52.260 --> 40:55.300
time at work I was trying to type in Google and I typed in goggle and it

40:55.300 --> 41:02.580
brought up porn years ago it was a typo good job that's like when you tell

41:02.580 --> 41:05.540
people at work like oh yeah if you want to see the latest so what's going on you

41:05.540 --> 41:10.020
you go to whitehouse.com with the president because whitehouse.com I don't

41:10.020 --> 41:14.260
know if it still is we used to be a porno site hmm cuz whitehouse.gov is the

41:14.260 --> 41:22.420
correct oh clever how about video game news did you know we do that you're on

41:22.420 --> 41:25.460
orange on radio once in a while why would we do that I don't know

41:25.460 --> 41:30.900
Loki do you have some are you busy looking for making sure it up it's not a

41:30.900 --> 41:36.420
real website anymore it used to be used to be yeah anyways big brother was

41:36.420 --> 41:42.900
watching they were and they were amused so super street fighter 4 is not coming

41:42.900 --> 41:47.620
out on PC I know people are probably surprised considering it's been months

41:47.620 --> 41:53.060
since it's been released but uh it's not coming on PC because apparently games

41:53.060 --> 42:00.740
are pirated and stuff on the PC so yeah they didn't want to release it on PC I

42:00.740 --> 42:07.940
guess what does that mean I think that their first Street Fighter 4 game got

42:07.940 --> 42:13.740
pirated a lot now I think apparently they said in a recent interview with

42:13.740 --> 42:22.580
fourgamer.net that Yoshin Nori Oh No confirmed that while the PC version of

42:22.580 --> 42:27.900
Street Fighter 4 was a big seller worldwide wait a second that sold a lot

42:27.900 --> 42:33.740
and wasn't really pirated that much then okay whatever the publisher has no plans

42:33.740 --> 42:38.500
to put the new and improved super Street Street Fighter 4 iteration on home

42:38.500 --> 42:43.100
computers new platforms high rate of piracy they said that the port is still

42:43.100 --> 42:50.060
possible if Capcom can find reasonable DRM solution for the title you honestly

42:50.060 --> 42:55.380
just forget it I mean cuz you're gonna waste all this damn time spend all this

42:55.380 --> 43:03.140
money on DRM solution and be cracked in a day I mean just put it out really it's

43:03.140 --> 43:08.140
you're not gonna get pirated any less than if you have DRM on it then not

43:08.140 --> 43:11.820
having DRM on it do you think there's gonna come a time when the companies

43:11.820 --> 43:15.580
just start saying you know what too bad so sad for the people that can't handle

43:15.580 --> 43:18.980
this but the DRM now is that you must connect to the internet and you have to

43:18.980 --> 43:21.980
put in a unique serial number just like you do for a lot of MMOs like World of

43:21.980 --> 43:26.020
Warcraft and stuff do you think the day is coming where you know what that too

43:26.020 --> 43:29.780
bad so sad if that DRM doesn't work for you but piracy has gotten so bad that we

43:29.780 --> 43:33.620
have no other choice cuz I keep thinking in my mind I kind of I'm surprised the

43:33.620 --> 43:37.460
companies haven't got to this point you know as much as I don't like it as a

43:37.460 --> 43:41.900
consumer it would surprise me at all if they started going there it's possible

43:41.900 --> 43:45.860
that they do that but even sometimes there's ways around that around getting

43:45.860 --> 43:50.620
the phone home and types you know that kind of thing you could for example have

43:50.620 --> 43:54.980
a program running in the background that mimics their authentication server and

43:54.980 --> 43:59.580
you just change the forwards on like a certain IP address on your computer so

43:59.580 --> 44:04.780
that it forwards to that they've done that for a few things you know like some

44:04.780 --> 44:08.540
of the Adobe programs and stuff like that you phone home and you can disable

44:08.540 --> 44:15.340
that I would know so I mean don't get me wrong I don't I don't want folks to hear

44:15.340 --> 44:18.380
me the wrong way I'm not like saying like I support this DRM to start

44:18.380 --> 44:22.220
happening but I wouldn't be surprised if companies kind of felt like there was no

44:22.220 --> 44:25.380
other choice and by this way of like big companies like Microsoft and stuff that

44:25.380 --> 44:30.100
put out these operating systems and they supposedly have these ways that you know

44:30.100 --> 44:35.660
the system you know calls home that you know authenticate Windows and that kind

44:35.660 --> 44:39.540
of thing and yet there's still pirated versions out there despite the fact

44:39.540 --> 44:45.740
there oh Windows 7 no we're gonna have stronger security and part it it's like

44:45.740 --> 44:51.380
okay so that took three seconds instead of two seconds okay well in the

44:51.380 --> 44:57.940
interest of the companies I mean DRM is not always gonna work I mean it some

44:57.940 --> 45:01.020
people may not want to spend the effort to try to get past it usually it just

45:01.020 --> 45:04.780
ends up hurting the people that bought the game legitimately and all it really

45:04.780 --> 45:10.900
does is delay when people pirate the game so that does drive some sales for

45:10.900 --> 45:14.740
people but they have to also realize a lot of people that we're gonna you know

45:14.740 --> 45:19.980
pirate the game probably we're gonna buy it originally so you technically not

45:19.980 --> 45:23.380
losing sales because if they can't pirate the game they're just not gonna

45:23.380 --> 45:26.260
download it and they're not gonna play it they're not gonna you know unless

45:26.260 --> 45:33.140
it's a really really good game they're not gonna go out and buy it all right

45:33.140 --> 45:36.780
hmm you guys remember the old like pathetic ways that they used to like try

45:36.780 --> 45:40.500
to stop pirating like we're gonna put a crazy word in the instruction booklet

45:40.500 --> 45:43.980
that you have to know like to get past the thing it's like yeah well then you

45:43.980 --> 45:48.220
just told all your friends what's the second word on page four of the manual

45:48.220 --> 45:51.260
yeah I'm yeah and what's the crazy you know third day of the week the way we

45:51.260 --> 45:53.100
said you know it was like and then you just tell all your friends and it

45:53.100 --> 45:57.620
doesn't matter the wheels I don't know the wheels yeah they for the Lucasarts

45:57.620 --> 46:01.060
games they had wheels that you had to rotate around at different things and

46:01.060 --> 46:06.860
then you'd have to read a code number out of one of the slots or something

46:06.860 --> 46:12.380
what wah wah and those even didn't work either because you could either

46:12.380 --> 46:16.540
photocopy the manual or you can rip apart that disk and photocopy the disk

46:16.540 --> 46:22.380
so once again it doesn't matter what DRM solutions they put out there even if

46:22.380 --> 46:26.860
it's a USB dongle or something like that some really expensive programs like

46:26.860 --> 46:30.900
graphic programs so like that that are you know thousands of dollars will

46:30.900 --> 46:33.860
actually have a physical device that needs to be plugged into the computer to

46:33.860 --> 46:37.340
work those still can be pirated though because people find ways to mimic

46:37.340 --> 46:41.860
whatever that device is and there's no way around everything everybody's gonna

46:41.860 --> 46:45.220
find a way around something given them out you know a significant amount of

46:45.220 --> 46:48.900
time there will always be a way around something because if you can make it

46:48.900 --> 46:53.860
someone else can make it again all right well speaking of a game that was

46:53.860 --> 46:58.740
somewhat hurt by piracy allegedly halo reach I came out of course a couple

46:58.740 --> 47:03.380
weeks ago and if you already have beat the game and you're already bored of it

47:03.380 --> 47:07.140
maybe there should be a mini game that you should go play that is actually

47:07.140 --> 47:12.380
hidden in halo reach it's called reach racer and it's a warthog racing game

47:12.380 --> 47:17.020
that is inside reach what happens is that if two people get to a spot in the

47:17.020 --> 47:24.660
oni sword base you can actually play this little mini game reach racer oh you

47:24.660 --> 47:28.860
all right over there you made me drop my mic sorry about that trauma I hey I

47:28.860 --> 47:31.500
think I think that's kind of cool I like when there's fun little things like that

47:31.500 --> 47:38.380
in a game so I just know all morning I was hearing boom yay boom yay boom yay

47:38.380 --> 47:44.340
all morning why was Dan playing halo reach yes is that what he actually says

47:44.340 --> 47:48.740
yeah no it has a little party mode thing in there where you get a headshot kids

47:48.740 --> 47:58.220
go and then they put on the duck boots from Castlevania go right sorry bones

47:58.220 --> 48:01.820
double o6 and share bonds double o6 and chat says okay that almost made me want

48:01.820 --> 48:06.740
to get reach that's kind of cool well the the forge editor and the reach

48:06.740 --> 48:12.540
anyways it's just really incredible anyways so maybe that's your thing going

48:12.540 --> 48:15.500
back up a little bit in chat Robert M is talking about the copy protection thing

48:15.500 --> 48:19.420
it says the pages with red paper to keep it from being copied I remember those

48:19.420 --> 48:24.540
two there were manuals that would have like the red paper so ridiculous but it

48:24.540 --> 48:28.340
kind of worked for a little bit like until the internet came out where it's

48:28.340 --> 48:41.260
color scanners and they're like foil again color copies not available to copy

48:41.260 --> 48:47.300
these CDs alright release dates coming up in a minute but first dark Sakura

48:47.300 --> 48:54.180
well there has been something that has been spotted a new Wii controller

48:54.180 --> 49:02.140
oh it's actually the Wii remote plus that seems to be a combination of the

49:02.140 --> 49:08.820
Wii motion plus and the Wii remote and it's gonna be coming with a game called

49:08.820 --> 49:19.380
fling smash that well it looks like tennis but with a crazy-ass ball so you

49:19.380 --> 49:25.660
have to use this ball guy named zip and you use your controller I guess to smack

49:25.660 --> 49:30.620
them around the different places I'd I'd have to see more than just this this

49:30.620 --> 49:38.820
picture and now there is no date out for the UK the game is listed but not the

49:38.820 --> 49:45.420
special controller so I don't know when they're gonna get it overseas I can't

49:45.420 --> 49:49.620
help but feel this is like kind of like a Wii play type thing it is throw in a

49:49.620 --> 49:53.260
controller with a subpar game there was there is no interest in this game

49:53.260 --> 49:56.380
whatsoever not that I'm judging this game without playing it but I'm just

49:56.380 --> 50:00.900
gonna take a wild guess and guess didn't say it's not very good it will be the

50:00.900 --> 50:04.220
best game of the there'll be the best-selling game of the year because it

50:04.220 --> 50:07.820
comes with a stupid remote well if you think about the games 50 bucks and you

50:07.820 --> 50:11.820
get a remote that's probably worth at least 50 bucks because I'm sure it's

50:11.820 --> 50:15.540
gonna be more than just the normal remote and people should get pissed off

50:15.540 --> 50:18.580
because now they bought a remote and super emotional plus and now they come

50:18.580 --> 50:24.060
out with something that's all-in-one despite the fact that perhaps they

50:24.060 --> 50:28.060
should have I don't know put it all in one to begin with so that they could do

50:28.060 --> 50:32.900
all the stuff that they said they were gonna be able to do it prints money

50:32.900 --> 50:39.460
dark use K and chat says whatever we is dead you guys agree no what what do you

50:39.460 --> 50:48.540
think rice princess we have a week now I use it for Netflix it's

50:48.700 --> 50:53.660
poop it's doing all right it's just there's I mean the games coming out that

50:53.660 --> 51:00.660
were our big releases for Nintendo I just don't really care too much about

51:00.660 --> 51:05.300
like ooh it's Donkey Kong Country again wow that's awesome I remember playing

51:05.300 --> 51:08.860
that back on super Nintendo let's not forget how amazed and in all we all were

51:08.860 --> 51:14.300
after e3 at you know their lineup and yes I was impressed with Metroid other

51:14.300 --> 51:19.220
M and then it sucked wow that's awesome thank you I'm glad that team ninja

51:19.220 --> 51:26.420
really pulled it off oh but it sucked and then you know new Zelda game whoop

51:26.420 --> 51:30.900
these shit it's just a brighter more colorful cheerful Twilight Princess with

51:30.900 --> 51:40.140
new gadgets and shit I mean I don't know it's it was it was sounds like fun it

51:40.140 --> 51:46.140
was it was a difference between like you know what it looks like on paper what it

51:46.140 --> 51:54.540
actually comes out to be and I don't know the 3ds 3ds will be kind of cool

51:54.540 --> 51:58.140
you'll have to check out what the games look like and stuff like that but as far

51:58.140 --> 52:01.260
as like the console releases for this year from Nintendo I could care less

52:01.260 --> 52:05.940
yeah Kirby's epic yarn I guess looks all right it's kind of a neat design for the

52:05.940 --> 52:11.300
game but you know like Donkey Kong I could care less or couldn't care less I

52:11.300 --> 52:17.780
guess because care less that makes no sense and then fling smash well no one

52:17.780 --> 52:21.820
cares about fling smash except now that has a you know stupid controller thing

52:21.820 --> 52:27.700
in it all right well let's travel around the world and look at some release dates

52:27.700 --> 52:32.300
of things that are coming out to a store near you real soon this week actually

52:32.300 --> 52:37.420
some pretty cool stuff coming out of course dead rising 2 will be out on

52:37.420 --> 52:43.660
PlayStation 3 Xbox 360 and PC this week so that's pretty sweet

52:43.660 --> 52:48.020
guitar hero warriors of rock you know it's kind of funny is a lot of the music

52:48.020 --> 52:53.860
games coming out nowadays people don't care so but guitar hero where he's a

52:53.860 --> 53:00.420
rock is coming out on PlayStation 3 Xbox 360 and we never forget they're all $60

53:00.420 --> 53:05.740
because Activision is fucking lame and so they decided to charge $60 for all

53:05.740 --> 53:11.860
three games because I don't know you're suckers and you'll buy it so wonderful

53:11.860 --> 53:15.260
let them get away with that and then they're gonna be charging $60 for all

53:15.260 --> 53:18.180
their Wii games oh but it doesn't matter because people don't buy games in the

53:18.180 --> 53:24.180
week also of course guitar hero warriors of rock will be coming out in different

53:24.180 --> 53:27.660
bundles they have one with like the full band set up which is really just the

53:27.660 --> 53:30.700
instruments from last year so don't expect the new guitar in that you can

53:30.700 --> 53:34.220

Spice Girls in a video game though I just can't help it here in my mind let's

59:43.980 --> 59:48.580

59:57.540 --> 01:00:02.380
crap like oops prank party just bogging down well okay I mean there's a lot of

01:00:02.380 --> 01:00:06.220
crap that comes out in between our Call of Duty games I make it snappy script

01:00:06.220 --> 01:00:10.980
spelling bee it's a spelling bee game on the DS that'll be exciting death smiles

01:00:10.980 --> 01:00:15.420
the version without all the fun extra stuff it's slightly cheaper on Xbox 360

01:00:15.420 --> 01:00:20.900
so I release their Final Fantasy 14 the I had to wait another week edition that

01:00:20.900 --> 01:00:28.300
is coming to us on PC painkiller pandemonium on PC what's pandemonium

01:00:28.300 --> 01:00:34.900
about it is it's probably not good and then I don't think this dates right but

01:00:34.900 --> 01:00:38.100
they're saying the sly collections coming on PlayStation 3 I think it's

01:00:38.100 --> 01:00:43.740
later in the later in the year and then finally this is high-quality Wii games

01:00:43.740 --> 01:00:47.020
for you this is one of those first party games for Nintendo that's really gonna

01:00:47.020 --> 01:00:53.720
innovate and change the whole landscape of the Wii we party coming to us on the

01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:57.540
Wii that's also from Hudson that made the Mario Party games I played it at e3

01:00:57.540 --> 01:01:02.580
it was cute but it's another party game cute that's just like with them

01:01:02.580 --> 01:01:07.460
complaining on why the GameCube people only buy it for kids stuff it's only got

01:01:07.460 --> 01:01:12.180
kids game why can't we get people to actually you know develop mature games

01:01:12.180 --> 01:01:19.140
on our system I don't know why you know I have a question for anyone no okay

01:01:19.140 --> 01:01:24.340
when you've heard of this game that's gonna come out and it's really hyped and

01:01:24.340 --> 01:01:26.820
it sounds really good and you really want to play it and then you actually

01:01:26.820 --> 01:01:33.180
get it lately has it lived up to the hype for you you mean like Final Fantasy

01:01:33.180 --> 01:01:39.300
14 when I played the beta yeah I wanted to cry it was so tears of joy no tears

01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:42.420
of pain yeah don't worry they're limiting the amount of suffering you

01:01:42.420 --> 01:01:46.380
actually have to endure because you can't play long hours on this game

01:01:46.380 --> 01:01:50.900
because they will start dropping your XP really yeah I haven't played the full

01:01:50.900 --> 01:01:55.260
game yet and like here's here's the sick thing y'all I'm really sick oh you're

01:01:55.260 --> 01:02:00.260
sick here's the thing um even though like I really hated the beta I still

01:02:00.260 --> 01:02:05.540
feel like I need to buy the retail game because I spent so much time on 11 and

01:02:05.540 --> 01:02:15.460
it's a Final Fantasy games oh that's exactly yes I know the industry you do

01:02:15.460 --> 01:02:20.660
have a problem it's called wasting your money on shit don't do it how about you

01:02:20.660 --> 01:02:24.140
just wait for the reviews to come out yeah I'm gonna try and see if some of

01:02:24.140 --> 01:02:29.620
the reviews what they say but I mean like okay remember back in the day like

01:02:29.620 --> 01:02:33.460
say with Symphony of the Night or like Metal Gear Solid or something there was

01:02:33.460 --> 01:02:37.620
this big hype about it and you play it and it's a great game it's innovative

01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:41.300
it's just wonderful nowadays it doesn't seem like there are games like that

01:02:41.300 --> 01:02:47.980
anymore what do you think Rob um I don't know I thought Final Fantasy 13 was

01:02:47.980 --> 01:02:51.380
pretty awesome and it had a lot of hype behind it I mean not 14 but 13 was

01:02:51.380 --> 01:02:56.580
pretty good I don't know sometimes the hype machine can kind of ruin games like

01:02:56.580 --> 01:02:59.580
I think part of the reason I didn't want to buy Halo Reach is that like you just

01:02:59.580 --> 01:03:03.300
can't get away from it and I'm just like like I was playing Lara Croft online and

01:03:03.300 --> 01:03:06.180
I actually got an Xbox Live message somebody that was like well you're not

01:03:06.180 --> 01:03:10.860
playing Halo Reach and I'm just like screw you I'll play what I want I'm like

01:03:10.860 --> 01:03:16.020
I'm gonna put in freaking cameo or one of like the Xbox 360 launch games just

01:03:16.020 --> 01:03:20.020
to irritate you but then I realized I'd actually have to play cameo and that I

01:03:20.020 --> 01:03:26.260
don't know I someone saw someone this week playing on my friends list and you

01:03:26.260 --> 01:03:31.020
know who you are I think cuz I don't remember who you are someone's actually

01:03:31.020 --> 01:03:42.020
playing lost via domus the lost console wow it was terrible absolutely terrible

01:03:42.020 --> 01:03:47.060
like the show lost the show law I was at the one where Michael's like man I don't

01:03:47.060 --> 01:03:50.860
have time for that world and all he was doing was yelling well the whole time

01:03:50.860 --> 01:03:56.700
like I remember that game it was awful all right let's go to Japanese release

01:03:56.700 --> 01:04:01.380
dates of Loki's known with the US coming out in Japan this week we have monster

01:04:01.380 --> 01:04:06.300
hunter frontier online season 9.0 on the Xbox 360 from Capcom is the monster

01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:09.500
hunter series is pretty epic over there although they don't really do anything

01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:14.300
with it here on the 360 interesting dead rising 2 gets its Japanese release this

01:04:14.300 --> 01:04:18.660
this week as well to kind of coincide with the stateside one over here Madden

01:04:18.660 --> 01:04:22.100
NFL 11 gets its release in Japan it's been out here for a little bit but it

01:04:22.100 --> 01:04:25.340
gets localized for Japan so it actually even though it's still all the same

01:04:25.340 --> 01:04:29.500
American football teams it's all in Japanese a game called quantum theory

01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:33.260
comes out on the Xbox 360 this week in Japan there's a regular and limited

01:04:33.260 --> 01:04:38.420
edition it's kind of a looks like kind of like a bayonetta II type of game I

01:04:38.420 --> 01:04:42.580
don't know lots of like epic looking cutscenes and guns and you know swords

01:04:42.580 --> 01:04:46.620
and limbs falling off and all that fun stuff that's from Tecmo I wonder if it's

01:04:46.620 --> 01:04:51.860
a team ninja game I don't think it is though going over to the PlayStation 3

01:04:51.860 --> 01:04:55.820
probably quite a few of those same games coming out of there yep dead rising 2

01:04:55.820 --> 01:04:59.620
comes out in Japan as well on the PlayStation 3 and quantum theory and

01:04:59.620 --> 01:05:03.180
Madden NFL so all those same games coming out on the PlayStation 3 as well

01:05:03.180 --> 01:05:08.100
but no monster hunter because that is exclusive I guess to the 360 going over

01:05:08.100 --> 01:05:13.660

Tom Clancy's ghost recon predator Tom Clancy's Hawks to also on October 1st

01:09:02.020 --> 01:09:07.740
FIFA 11 Sean White skateboarding Tom Clancy's Hawks to again for over PC and

01:09:07.740 --> 01:09:15.340
that's it for this week on the end of that

01:09:15.340 --> 01:09:26.180
fiend so something that hopefully you didn't purchase a PB well of course as

01:09:26.180 --> 01:09:31.180
we mentioned last week a PB is no more it has been canceled after just three

01:09:31.180 --> 01:09:37.200
months and well fans aren't exactly happy about that they are a little

01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:41.100
upset because they invested you know 50 bucks on the game that they can no

01:09:41.100 --> 01:09:48.240
longer play well apparently I guess people have been trying to get refunds

01:09:48.240 --> 01:09:54.780
via steam and haven't really met you know with any success on that but EA

01:09:54.780 --> 01:09:59.640
apparently is gonna try to help people out it says the user has been posting

01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:04.680
about their experience talking to EA support regarding this issue several

01:10:04.680 --> 01:10:10.300
users have been able to receive a $20 discount code for their inconvenience

01:10:10.300 --> 01:10:15.140
while others have I guess managed to convince support representatives to give

01:10:15.140 --> 01:10:20.940
them a game of equivalent value the I guess the person that posted the threat

01:10:20.940 --> 01:10:24.840
originally included a chat log that shows that they were able to get a copy

01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:33.940
of Dragon Age 2 upon the tiles release so I guess if you bought a PB you may

01:10:33.940 --> 01:10:39.780
want to go chat with EA support which is of course support.ea.com and see if they

01:10:39.780 --> 01:10:43.260
can help you out and get you some of your money back that you spent on it

01:10:43.260 --> 01:10:52.860
you're gross Rob sorry sorry totally listening to Loki right now I promise

01:10:52.860 --> 01:10:58.500
mm-hmm yes well I'm not talking anymore so that's not really helpful we're still

01:10:58.500 --> 01:11:03.700
listening to you okay I was offering rice princess and black licorice and she

01:11:03.700 --> 01:11:08.540
was like oh no get that out of my face looks like dog crap I don't want your

01:11:08.540 --> 01:11:13.220
licorice it's really good you want some dark soccer I can't have licorice

01:11:13.220 --> 01:11:18.940
and Dan insists on eating it around me in his car and I'm like gag it's really

01:11:18.940 --> 01:11:22.380
good so what I had to do since rice princess loves it so much I waved the

01:11:22.380 --> 01:11:25.500
bag in front of her face so she could get the smell and then she's like sure I

01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:29.940
want one and that means she just wants to take one to throw it at me so I let

01:11:29.940 --> 01:11:36.540
her put her hand in the bag to grab when she's all like you put them up your butt

01:11:36.540 --> 01:11:43.080
before you put them in the bag knock it off all right oh yeah bummer about APB

01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:48.380
and all that but I feel bad for those customer service reps that I have to

01:11:48.380 --> 01:11:51.020
deal with all the angst because you know it's gonna open the floodgate once you

01:11:51.020 --> 01:11:55.180
hear the one person got something free now you know no thanks in part to this

01:11:55.180 --> 01:11:59.420
show there's gonna be tons of people that go on there and they're like I want

01:11:59.420 --> 01:12:04.780
my free stuff I bought APB where's my free stuff just like that I found a

01:12:04.780 --> 01:12:10.380
Christmas card that was hello random no I school it was sent to me by one of our

01:12:10.380 --> 01:12:16.140
listeners by by Rob overseas mm-hmm and it says fuck office parties fuck jingle

01:12:16.140 --> 01:12:20.340
bells fuck mince pies fuck Rudolph like Santa fuck Christmas how appropriate

01:12:20.340 --> 01:12:25.820
since you're Jewish now yes I'm gonna put it up on my desk right now good idea

01:12:25.820 --> 01:12:31.140
all right hey let's say 100 Matt wants to know us so what's the difference is

01:12:31.140 --> 01:12:37.040
the black licorice bigger and longer just tastier actually yeah if you like

01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:44.820
the taste of shit like which is amazing all right bro you're gross your face is

01:12:44.820 --> 01:12:48.920
gross hey this game is awesome though it's not gross at all you don't know

01:12:48.920 --> 01:12:53.420
Jack remember this game this is like the best video game ever I loved this game

01:12:53.420 --> 01:12:57.260
it's hardly a video game but yeah that's like a game show you type of game well

01:12:57.260 --> 01:13:03.820
anyway it's been rated by the ESRB for the 360 the Wii and the PlayStation 3

01:13:03.820 --> 01:13:07.780
and you know what that means it's coming out soon because the ESRB always ruins

01:13:07.780 --> 01:13:13.140
and spoils releases so it looks like it is really happening THQ is revamping it

01:13:13.140 --> 01:13:19.540
all we know is that the game got rated on crude humor quote the ending credits

01:13:19.540 --> 01:13:24.620
contain audio commercials of fictitious TV reality programs for example farting

01:13:24.620 --> 01:13:30.380
with the stars which is accompanied by lard loud flatulent sound effects yay

01:13:30.380 --> 01:13:36.740
more dick and fart jokes my favorite yay I never talk about those not at all so

01:13:36.740 --> 01:13:45.340
I'm your card you should put a picture up of rice princess holding black

01:13:45.340 --> 01:13:51.220
licorice I'm never touching it ever again shut up all right I think this

01:13:51.220 --> 01:13:55.980
means now that our show is starting to completely derail it's time to bring it

01:13:55.980 --> 01:14:01.800
back to some classics for the segment we call here on orange lounge radio the

01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:05.500
classic game of the week it's a chance for dark soccer to dive into the video

01:14:05.500 --> 01:14:10.780
game vault and find a game that she thinks hey you kids and your spinach

01:14:10.780 --> 01:14:15.620
trucks stop chasing the spinach truck and play this video game for a little

01:14:15.620 --> 01:14:21.820
bit dark soccer what's the classic game of the week elevator action whoa

01:14:21.820 --> 01:14:29.540
Ella later go down good end a whole elevator action is first of all this is

01:14:29.540 --> 01:14:46.540
Dan suggestion okay elevator action came out in 1983 by Taito you know what else

01:14:46.540 --> 01:14:55.380
Taito gave us bubble bobble and puzzle bobble yay I love Taito games and it

01:14:55.380 --> 01:15:02.940
actually had a sequel elevator action 2 also called elevator action returns the

01:15:02.940 --> 01:15:10.580
game is great it's the music was done by Yoshino Imamura so let's go on with how

01:15:10.580 --> 01:15:15.700
the game is played you play a spy and you go down an elevator you actually

01:15:15.700 --> 01:15:21.100
are in a building that has lots of elevators and you have to can get secret

01:15:21.100 --> 01:15:25.860
documents and go through 30 levels and then do all these puzzles involving

01:15:25.860 --> 01:15:30.300
different elevators and you've got enemy agents they're trying to shoot you no

01:15:30.300 --> 01:15:37.740
face so you either have to shoot them back or run away or hide and you get all

01:15:37.740 --> 01:15:44.260
your documents and you go from the top of the building to the bottom and the

01:15:44.260 --> 01:15:48.740
lower that you get you actually have to solve more puzzles to get around it the

01:15:48.740 --> 01:15:53.620
control was a four-way joystick two buttons one for shooting the other for

01:15:53.620 --> 01:15:58.300
jumping and kicking because I always jump and kick at the same time so very

01:15:58.300 --> 01:16:02.940
very simple easy game two players you'd alternate times you play as agent 17

01:16:02.940 --> 01:16:13.020
codenamed Otto so you don't have a timer but you do have a time limit it goes

01:16:13.020 --> 01:16:18.820
into a hurry-up mode so the music will change and tell you to hurry up pretty

01:16:18.820 --> 01:16:25.980
much yeah um you see you have different you get a different score for

01:16:25.980 --> 01:16:30.900
retrieving documents knocking on agent by dropping a light on them crush an

01:16:30.900 --> 01:16:35.620
agent using the elevator gory yeah you can get crushed to the elevator too if

01:16:35.620 --> 01:16:40.200
you're not careful knock out an agent by jumping or kicking eliminate an agent by

01:16:40.200 --> 01:16:44.820
gun and you get bonus points completing each round and you also get an extra

01:16:44.820 --> 01:16:52.940
life we hit 10,000 points as far as versions of it there is actually a

01:16:52.940 --> 01:17:00.900
parody called Ella paper action which is a that sounds stupid yeah um they had a

01:17:00.900 --> 01:17:06.660
two of them on palm OS agency and agency two it's based on elevator action

01:17:06.660 --> 01:17:10.540
there's Dexter's laboratory robot rampage that's based on elevator action

01:17:10.540 --> 01:17:17.280
to 505 games put a similar game out on the week called spy games elevator

01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:22.180
mission it's called elevator combat in Europe there's a port on Gameboy there's

01:17:22.180 --> 01:17:28.420
any s version that made it on to the virtual console in 2007 and an elevator

01:17:28.420 --> 01:17:32.280
action death parade is a light gun shooter that uses elevator doors when

01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:42.300
changing scenes so there you go as far as earlier ports there was the ZX

01:17:42.300 --> 01:17:48.600
spectrum and shred CPC MSX Commodore 64 Nintendo Entertainment System and Game

01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:54.060
Boy there was one plan for the Atari 2600 but there is it never was released

01:17:54.060 --> 01:18:00.240
however the prototype exists and was sold at classic gaming Expo 2001 it was

01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:05.400
only 95% complete though and then Sony had a mobile version of it as far as

01:18:05.400 --> 01:18:09.100
compilations we have elevator action EX for Game Boy Color elevator action old

01:18:09.100 --> 01:18:12.780
new Game Boy Advance elevator action returns on Sega Saturn which I think I

01:18:12.780 --> 01:18:20.300
have title legends set in the title legends power up and yeah that's it so

01:18:20.300 --> 01:18:23.760
can I be honest about something what I think this game sucks like it's one of

01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:28.340
those things I remember much more fondly as a child but I actually bought that

01:18:28.340 --> 01:18:33.060
title collection when it was out on the regular Xbox and kind of revisited this

01:18:33.060 --> 01:18:36.260
game and I was like this game is horrible like I think part of that's

01:18:36.260 --> 01:18:39.580
just cuz it's really hard and always get crushed by elevators I've seen Dan play

01:18:39.580 --> 01:18:43.740
through this game just like all the time really and when I said hey Dan help me

01:18:43.740 --> 01:18:49.380
think of a classic game he's like elevator action okay no I mean it is a

01:18:49.380 --> 01:18:52.460
classic in some regards I just I didn't I thought it was one of those games

01:18:52.460 --> 01:18:55.580
always kind of looked better than it played now you know what came in in this

01:18:55.580 --> 01:19:04.700
vein that I actually like a whole lot better hmm mappy maybe mappy will be on

01:19:04.700 --> 01:19:09.380
the list one day all right well there it is good old good Namco goodness like it

01:19:09.380 --> 01:19:13.500
or not your classic game of the week elevator action elevator action there

01:19:13.500 --> 01:19:17.100
it is that's a pretty cool YouTube to the guy beating the level because it

01:19:17.100 --> 01:19:20.980
makes it look so easy it's really not this game is hard if you ever play this

01:19:20.980 --> 01:19:26.740
game rice princess no it's hard looks like it it is okay all right well that's

01:19:26.740 --> 01:19:30.020

New Year's yeah crazy huh no wait a little further than that like January

February maybe just in time for Valentine's Day whoa all right joining

01:20:28.660 --> 01:20:32.060
us tonight as you can hear a rice princess and the doctor and we were

01:20:32.060 --> 01:20:35.260
talking a little bit about the break music which I know you podcaster folks

01:20:35.260 --> 01:20:39.460
can't hear it sadly it's copyright stuff I'm sorry you can't play it but we can

01:20:39.460 --> 01:20:43.600
do it live and we played a variety of songs during that break and the last one

01:20:43.600 --> 01:20:47.180
we played was from Secret of Mana the flight into the unknown and that made

01:20:47.180 --> 01:20:50.460
Jamie go let's have a secret of mana party and I'm like wow yes that's a

01:20:50.460 --> 01:20:54.500
great idea for sirs cuz I haven't played secret how long does that game take to

01:20:54.500 --> 01:20:58.340
beat though it's a really long time isn't it it's a yeah I think you can be

01:20:58.340 --> 01:21:07.460
in one sitting oh unless we marathon did switched out who would be crazy the

01:21:07.460 --> 01:21:11.180
doctors taking pictures in studio I don't know why I'm just kidding so but

01:21:11.180 --> 01:21:16.420
um yeah the secret about a marathon would be fun I actually got really far

01:21:16.420 --> 01:21:19.500
and secret to evermore I got really close to beating it I never did though I

01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:25.220
don't think evermore is nearly as bad as some people think it was yeah oh yeah

01:21:25.220 --> 01:21:31.820
Wow you know you know we should do we should do RPG a month seriously good

01:21:31.820 --> 01:21:37.860
luck tearing me away from Wow but here's Rob's RPG of life maybe on oh

01:21:37.860 --> 01:21:41.060
something else about secret evermore cuz another song we played in that break

01:21:41.060 --> 01:21:45.900
was the theme to Guild Wars which I think that composer that does the the

01:21:45.900 --> 01:21:50.020
soundtrack to Guild Wars Jeremy soule I think is how you say his last name is

01:21:50.020 --> 01:21:54.220
really talented and he composed that when he was like a practically teenager

01:21:54.220 --> 01:21:58.380
like 19 or 20 I think he did secret evermore like when he was a teenager he

01:21:58.380 --> 01:22:03.460
actually I think composed that soundtrack so cray-cray crazy right so I

01:22:03.460 --> 01:22:05.980
think actually no I think it take the bat he was 19 when he did I think the

01:22:05.980 --> 01:22:08.880
secret evermore stuff and then later on probably in his 20s he did the Gil war

01:22:08.880 --> 01:22:11.780
stuff but he was very young when he did a lot of that and he did the music to

01:22:11.780 --> 01:22:15.620
oblivion which I know you're not a big fan of that game but the soundtrack is a

01:22:15.620 --> 01:22:21.560
amazing yeah he's a talented guy so he did the music to pray which even though

01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:24.900
it was kind of a and for actually it's one of the few first-person shooters I

01:22:24.900 --> 01:22:28.920
really really really liked and you know why because it was made for people who

01:22:28.920 --> 01:22:32.060
are terrible at first-person shooters because you never die you cannot die and

01:22:32.060 --> 01:22:37.100
pray it's easy mode when you die you go into the spirit world where you have to

01:22:37.100 --> 01:22:41.280
shoot these like ghost looking things to regain your health and stuff and then

01:22:41.280 --> 01:22:45.440
you go back right where you left off so pray is like total easy mode but it had

01:22:45.440 --> 01:22:49.540
really good music so anyway cool there you go

01:22:49.540 --> 01:22:54.420
chat that orange lounge radio.com you're playing plants versus zombies salacious

01:22:54.420 --> 01:22:58.020
pop and chat says people who hated evermore were just being 16 year old

01:22:58.020 --> 01:23:01.540
weeaboo square stands and didn't like it because it was square USA developed and

01:23:01.540 --> 01:23:05.060

01:23:47.940 --> 01:23:50.940
those twitter topics and we're gonna be getting to those in just a moment but in

01:23:50.940 --> 01:23:56.260
the meantime some fast rapid-fire news starting with Loki yes there is an

01:23:56.260 --> 01:24:00.740
update done to 3d game heroes this week you may remember that game the one that's

01:24:00.740 --> 01:24:06.060
kind of like Zelda but not this time they've done an update that adds a sack

01:24:06.060 --> 01:24:11.940
boy playable character which is kind of cool and then on top of that there's

01:24:11.940 --> 01:24:18.020
also some 50 new player made heroes that have been added to everyone's lineup

01:24:18.020 --> 01:24:23.460
plus allows the players to carry weapons over into their new game plus files and

01:24:23.460 --> 01:24:30.580
incorporate a handful of bug fixes that they've done to the game so that's kind

01:24:30.580 --> 01:24:34.100
of cool sounds awesome that's one of those games like I played like maybe the

01:24:34.100 --> 01:24:38.340
first third I have not touched my copy of it yet it's actually so it's it's

01:24:38.340 --> 01:24:44.220
again it is the Legend of Zelda on ps3 and I am surprised Nintendo has not

01:24:44.220 --> 01:24:48.740
sued yet like it is that close to the original Legend of Zelda it's you'd like

01:24:48.740 --> 01:24:52.260
this game I think Grace Princess cuz you like the old school games right I do

01:24:52.260 --> 01:25:00.140
like the old school this 3d game hero is like one big just BJ to old video games

01:25:00.140 --> 01:25:06.220
Wow no right that's hot I know wait so which Zelda is it most like the very

01:25:06.220 --> 01:25:13.260

01:25:48.500 --> 01:25:56.100
a fan made Half-Life 2 movie trailer that was put out at now this is not just

01:25:56.100 --> 01:26:02.460
some amateur movie trailer by the way it's actually done by an animator Marco

01:26:02.460 --> 01:26:10.900
Sputoni and he's actually I believe he works for Weta so he has one damn sexy

01:26:10.900 --> 01:26:15.300
trailer out there that could very well turn into a real movie I mean it looks

01:26:15.300 --> 01:26:20.320
pretty awesome so that's available out there right now check out and then of

01:26:20.320 --> 01:26:25.340
course a trailer for a game that I I've been looking forward to for quite a long

01:26:25.340 --> 01:26:31.660
time and this week during I believe is left over from last week at Tokyo game

01:26:31.660 --> 01:26:35.900
show Earth Defense Force insect Armageddon has its first trailer out

01:26:35.900 --> 01:26:40.540
there and it looks awesome it's a got this giant spider mech thing that's

01:26:40.540 --> 01:26:44.860
attacking New Detroit which is the city that the game is gonna take place in and

01:26:44.860 --> 01:26:50.180
also looks like it carries over some of the stuff from Earth Defense Force to

01:26:50.180 --> 01:26:54.300
including a jetpack and I believe there's four different upgrade armors

01:26:54.300 --> 01:26:58.780
you're gonna be able to get I'm assuming one of them is this jetpack thing so I

01:26:58.780 --> 01:27:03.540
can't wait it's supposed to be coming out this fall or not this fall uh that'd

01:27:03.540 --> 01:27:07.860
be cool no this spring speaking of trailers and she brought up that

01:27:07.860 --> 01:27:13.780
Half-Life 2 trailer did you see that freaking Pokemon real life Pokemon

01:27:13.780 --> 01:27:18.780
Armageddon or whatever it was dumb what in the heck was that it's like for those

01:27:18.780 --> 01:27:23.380
that didn't see it it's like real have you guys seen the rice princess started

01:27:23.380 --> 01:27:26.940
watching it but then I realized it was Pokemon and I was just like it's like

01:27:26.940 --> 01:27:30.020
somebody took Pokemon and made it real life and it's like obviously like a

01:27:30.020 --> 01:27:33.140
student project or something was like a big-budget student project like it's

01:27:33.140 --> 01:27:38.980
it's crazy how kind of the team rocket things are all you know the sci-fi of or

01:27:38.980 --> 01:27:42.340
the the the effects were good enough for sci-fi television because that's what

01:27:42.340 --> 01:27:45.220
the special effects look like was like the really bad like shark to post kind

01:27:45.220 --> 01:27:52.220
of effects so that's awesome yeah just saying so I got this got me thinking

01:27:52.220 --> 01:27:55.220
here because again you know there's folks in chat talking about like

01:27:55.220 --> 01:27:57.940
role-playing games and stuff a salacious pop is saying you know what I really

01:27:57.940 --> 01:28:00.980
enjoyed Final Fantasy mystic quest because I played it knowing it was kitty

01:28:00.980 --> 01:28:03.540
you know that game wasn't as terrible as everybody out made it to be it just

01:28:03.540 --> 01:28:08.140
wasn't Final Fantasy just like 11 but actually I think dark soccer might be

01:28:08.140 --> 01:28:11.180
onto something with the role-playing game of the month you know I have an

01:28:11.180 --> 01:28:15.660
idea what do you think like we pick like a role-playing game like a classic of

01:28:15.660 --> 01:28:21.540
some sort that we would see who can get the furthest in like a month and then we

01:28:21.540 --> 01:28:27.100
could have like a blog of how we're doing in the game and submit screenshots

01:28:27.100 --> 01:28:30.020
and stuff like that why are you laughing rice princess because I think the first

01:28:30.020 --> 01:28:34.420
game should be earthbound well maybe even lose maybe the first game can't be

01:28:34.420 --> 01:28:37.060
earthbound I don't know what do you think dark side do you like this idea

01:28:37.060 --> 01:28:40.860
should we should we have like a classic role-playing game that we all have to

01:28:40.860 --> 01:28:44.540
play I can already tell you I would I would freaking lose because I have

01:28:44.540 --> 01:28:52.700
school we'll have work yeah but work doesn't give you homework sometimes they

01:28:52.700 --> 01:29:00.940
do actually so maybe maybe we should just pick like one night where we've got

01:29:00.940 --> 01:29:07.740
nothing going on and do do this do the Zelda fest what what no I saw a

01:29:07.740 --> 01:29:11.140
role-playing on a Zelda fest quit trying to change something no it's like the

01:29:11.140 --> 01:29:16.740
Zelda fest we see who can get the furthest ah okay okay by like a certain

01:29:16.740 --> 01:29:20.940
time limit we could do something like that could be interesting fun or be like

01:29:20.940 --> 01:29:24.420
still playing damn plants versus zombies because I recognize the music because it

01:29:24.420 --> 01:29:29.500
plays in my sleep now and SSG 100 Matt says this will happen when Rob and Jamie

01:29:29.500 --> 01:29:34.780
actually play their magic card battle yeah that was like a year ago right no I

01:29:34.780 --> 01:29:39.700
found them recently magic all right I have to let me get back into some quick

01:29:39.700 --> 01:29:43.420
news here this is news that makes me very happy and I know to make Loki very

01:29:43.420 --> 01:29:48.060
very happy rumors abound once again that Capcom is indeed working on a new

01:29:48.060 --> 01:29:53.420
Mega Man Legends game this is as they should be this is a source telling

01:29:53.420 --> 01:29:58.660
Mega Man fansite Rockman Corner that apparently a new game in this series

01:29:58.660 --> 01:30:02.980
that started on the PlayStation 1 is in development they're not confirming that

01:30:02.980 --> 01:30:07.020
it's called Mega Man Legends 3 but they are saying it's the next entry in the

01:30:07.020 --> 01:30:09.580
series which makes it would make sense to me that it's not gonna be like

01:30:09.580 --> 01:30:13.460
Mega Man Legends 3 it'll be like Mega Man Legends with some subtitle that acts

01:30:13.460 --> 01:30:17.820
as like a reboot because you know it's been a good what eight years at least

01:30:17.820 --> 01:30:22.620
since we've seen the last game in the series so yeah this project right now is

01:30:22.620 --> 01:30:26.300
very very secretive and not a lot of information is available now you might

01:30:26.300 --> 01:30:29.380
just say well okay anybody could pull out of their ass that they're working on

01:30:29.380 --> 01:30:34.540
a new Mega Man Legends game what brings this some clout to it the tipster that

01:30:34.540 --> 01:30:39.620
is bringing this to the attention of Rockman Corner is called the shadow and

01:30:39.620 --> 01:30:42.820
you have to trust the shadow because Alec Baldwin played him no but the

01:30:42.820 --> 01:30:47.500
shadow also pegged the release date of Mega Man 9 and some of the very specific

01:30:47.500 --> 01:30:51.900
details in the game so it's somebody who has kind of done this before so who

01:30:51.900 --> 01:30:57.720
knows could be very cool I'm excited I would love to see kind of something we

01:30:57.720 --> 01:31:00.580
didn't get to tonight but I know had been floating around out there was a

01:31:00.580 --> 01:31:05.900
Mega Man Doom mod that made Doom look like Mega Man Legends kind of it was it

01:31:05.900 --> 01:31:10.940
was actually kind of awesome I have to admit so we have let's see when the

01:31:10.940 --> 01:31:14.140
Kinect comes out we're going to have dance masters from Konami we're gonna

01:31:14.140 --> 01:31:18.620
have dance central from harmonix well guess what overseas they're getting a

01:31:18.620 --> 01:31:23.100
game called dance paradise in Europe it's coming from mindscape and you're

01:31:23.100 --> 01:31:27.100
universal music it's gonna be coming out when the Kinect comes out no word on a

01:31:27.100 --> 01:31:31.900
release over here but just to give you a kind of a heads up on what to expect in

01:31:31.900 --> 01:31:35.420
this game since it is a partnership with Universal Music you do have some pretty

01:31:35.420 --> 01:31:39.300
big names in this for instance David Guetta and Kelly Rowland when love takes

01:31:39.300 --> 01:31:44.060
over Gwen Stefani what you waiting for Lady Gaga bad romance LaRue

01:31:44.060 --> 01:31:48.700
bulletproof MC Hammer can't touch this no doubt hey baby

01:31:48.700 --> 01:31:52.620
Sophie Ellis I just I love that all of those songs were in the last few months

01:31:52.620 --> 01:31:57.340
and then MC Hammer with Kentucky from 30 years ago so feel it but it's a classic

01:31:57.340 --> 01:32:02.420
Sophie Ellis Beckster with murder on the dance floor and the doctor's favorite

01:32:02.420 --> 01:32:08.180
song Jerry Halliwell with its raining men remember MC Hammer needs money well

01:32:08.180 --> 01:32:11.540
you know as you know but then I'm looking at screenshots of the game and

01:32:11.540 --> 01:32:14.500
I'm kind of like oh this looks like it's gonna be like kind of a cheap hack of a

01:32:14.500 --> 01:32:18.580
game I don't know I don't know if it looks really that good but the song list

01:32:18.580 --> 01:32:25.420
is is pretty darn good because they did team up with Universal Music so hmm so

01:32:25.420 --> 01:32:31.420
20 of the 40 songs have been announced so far so yeah I don't know interested

01:32:31.420 --> 01:32:35.900
to see more in that also one other story there's rumors going around this week

01:32:35.900 --> 01:32:41.140
that project Milo was canceled this week 19 contractors that were working on the

01:32:41.140 --> 01:32:44.460
project were let go some of the other people that were on the project are

01:32:44.460 --> 01:32:48.460
going to be using the technology in a new fable themed connect game when your

01:32:48.460 --> 01:32:54.620
game doesn't have a title it's probably not going to come out yet I agree with

01:32:54.620 --> 01:32:58.260
last week's statement from that it was basically the creepy pedo in the yard

01:32:58.260 --> 01:33:03.380
game like just watching those videos was scary so lion head isn't gonna comment

01:33:03.380 --> 01:33:08.940
on rumors or speculation but it's looking like yeah might not happen by

01:33:08.940 --> 01:33:12.380
the way Peter Molyneux was quoted in the past few months saying that Milo is

01:33:12.380 --> 01:33:16.340
basically a very very big tech demo so maybe that was the hint that the

01:33:16.340 --> 01:33:21.420
beginning of the end was coming so that's all I've got dark Sakura I got

01:33:21.420 --> 01:33:27.620
some stuff how about rock band we have the download content coming out that

01:33:27.620 --> 01:33:33.580
will be a lot of anthrax woohoo I love anthrax so the anthrax pack will be

01:33:33.580 --> 01:33:39.740
among the living I'm the man Indians mad house which I love that song and metal

01:33:39.740 --> 01:33:45.060
thrashing mad actually the later two are live versions and the whole pack will be

01:33:45.060 --> 01:33:50.460
680 Microsoft points for individual tracks coming out stuff again that I

01:33:50.460 --> 01:33:55.500
have to get my chemical romance I'm not okay and welcome to the black parade

01:33:55.500 --> 01:33:59.940
totally totally want both of those 30 seconds to Mars closer to the edge a

01:33:59.940 --> 01:34:04.460
tray of coffin nails buck cherry out of line and two doobie brothers tracks

01:34:04.460 --> 01:34:07.660
listen to the music and long train running I still can't believe there's a

01:34:07.660 --> 01:34:13.700
band called Atreyu there's a band saying there's a band called ludo all right

01:34:13.700 --> 01:34:19.380
that's awesome yes and they're pretty cool so as far as other stuff how about

01:34:19.380 --> 01:34:27.780
cave story there is going to be a DSI where and what I heard a gasp I just I

01:34:27.780 --> 01:34:30.660
like cave story now looks really cool if there's that a screenshot that we're

01:34:30.660 --> 01:34:33.420
looking at here that's cool like updated version of the cave story graphics on

01:34:33.420 --> 01:34:41.700
the screen well and basically yeah and actually yeah it's um commission if this

01:34:41.700 --> 01:34:47.100
picture was commissioned in honor of the announcement so I guess it's a maybe an

01:34:47.100 --> 01:34:52.860
idea of what it might be could be like but at any rate it's going to be a DSI

01:34:52.860 --> 01:34:58.460
where a version of the game and it will they say it's done they're just testing

01:34:58.460 --> 01:35:09.180
it and it's apparently going to I have a classic one and an update and then last

01:35:09.180 --> 01:35:14.660
but not least Donkey Kong Country for Wii it's called Donkey Kong Country

01:35:14.660 --> 01:35:20.540
Returns and it comes with a banana pocket for your it's like a condom for

01:35:20.540 --> 01:35:26.820
your condom for your Wii it kept anyway it comes with this banana thing that you

01:35:26.820 --> 01:35:35.060
can put your wiimote into so double banana it's a banana pouch I just keep

01:35:35.060 --> 01:35:46.660
thinking maybe I'm just banana it's a penis joke at any rate if you pre-order

01:35:46.660 --> 01:35:52.500
it you get beta access and downloadable skins and the bananas are probably

01:35:52.500 --> 01:35:57.820
limited edition should be out on November 21st like anyone gives a crap

01:35:57.820 --> 01:36:03.060

01:40:15.900 --> 01:40:21.020
he's throwing out a plug for that website Matt sj100 Matt is sending us a

01:40:21.020 --> 01:40:25.860
tweet saying remember Bobby Black Wolf's listless idea for a gun con dating sim

01:40:25.860 --> 01:40:31.500

01:40:31.500 --> 01:40:40.100
Xbox 360s shooter Wow yes it does look like a gun shooting dating game that's

you're shooting at them you're rescuing them from not having an orgasm oh you

01:41:12.100 --> 01:41:27.140
are shooting them with hearts and flowers

01:41:27.140 --> 01:41:31.580
you look so ridiculous I can't even explain so it's basically like the level

01:41:31.580 --> 01:41:35.260
in back to the future on the NES where like you're avoiding the hearts except

01:41:35.260 --> 01:41:39.460
now you're shooting them blue swim is linking us to a YouTube saying sky is

no no

01:41:56.540 --> 01:42:01.500
that's a neat effect though this is a perspective effect oh you know what

01:42:01.500 --> 01:42:05.700
there's a game on the iPad that kind of does that it's on it is what it is or

Twitter topics tonight if you want to send us tweets in the future twitter.com

slash o LR is the place where you can follow us on Twitter you should follow

01:43:16.140 --> 01:43:18.980
us on Twitter anyway so that way we can tweet you with reminders about what's

01:43:18.980 --> 01:43:23.020
coming up with the show yay when sometimes when we go to conventions and

01:43:23.020 --> 01:43:27.300
stuff random things we will send out on the Twitter as well like pictures and

01:43:27.300 --> 01:43:30.620
all that cool stuff all right back into some more news Loki what do you got for

01:43:30.620 --> 01:43:40.180
us I've got plants versus always not I've got some cool stuff including you

01:43:40.180 --> 01:43:45.180
may remember some of the things that Sony does to you know curb piracy and

01:43:45.180 --> 01:43:54.340
stuff well now they've disabled it's funny because everybody's joking oh now

01:43:54.340 --> 01:43:58.780
they have those USB mod chips they're gonna disable the USB ports I only

01:43:58.780 --> 01:44:05.460
weren't that far off they've disabled some USB peripherals I guess according

01:44:05.460 --> 01:44:11.580
to a report that was on their website the issue I guess they were disabling

01:44:11.580 --> 01:44:18.620
counterfeit ps3 controllers but it was actually disabling third our unlicensed

01:44:18.620 --> 01:44:25.020
third-party controllers in some of these devices affected by this actually were

01:44:25.020 --> 01:44:31.940
the yobo ps3 joybox which I believe is an arcade stick the XCM cross battle

01:44:31.940 --> 01:44:38.220
plus adapter which was kind of a adapter lie you use an Xbox 360 controller on

01:44:38.220 --> 01:44:43.700
the PlayStation 3 and the split the split fish frag FX which is kind of a

01:44:43.700 --> 01:44:50.780
hybrid controller and mouse and that's kind of lame that that's part of firmware

01:44:50.780 --> 01:44:56.260
3.5 other things though that it kind of broke as well some old mad cats

01:44:56.260 --> 01:45:01.660
controllers even though they are fully licensed apparently they are now broken

01:45:01.660 --> 01:45:09.860
so if you only 2008 wireless ps3 gamepad or the 2008 wired ps3 gamepad or the

01:45:09.860 --> 01:45:14.700
ps3 wireless micro con which is now discontinued they do not work anymore

01:45:14.700 --> 01:45:22.900
so man if I were mad cats I would be pissed like especially if they're

01:45:22.900 --> 01:45:27.260
licensed if they're unlicensed well then too bad so sad right but if they're

01:45:27.260 --> 01:45:34.260
licensed that's grounds to like sue and stuff yes soon well and I don't know if

01:45:34.260 --> 01:45:41.660
this is like meant to stop people from using the USB mod chips but that last

01:45:41.660 --> 01:45:46.900
firmware update was to stop people from using the USB mod chips so I can only

01:45:46.900 --> 01:45:52.340
assume this is either an extra precaution or they're just being dicks

01:45:52.340 --> 01:45:56.140
I'm gonna go with the latter I think they're being dicks because really I

01:45:56.140 --> 01:45:59.700
don't know about you but I haven't heard of some big ol mass problem with

01:45:59.700 --> 01:46:04.020
counterfeit controllers I don't know people out there going oh man all those

01:46:04.020 --> 01:46:09.100
counterfeit controllers out there I just can't find a good ps3 controller well

01:46:09.100 --> 01:46:12.660
there are a lot of shitty controllers out there actually yeah but these are

01:46:12.660 --> 01:46:16.380
actually counterfeit controllers there's a YouTube that was on Kotaku as well

01:46:16.380 --> 01:46:21.500
where someone actually bought a cheap DualShock 3 controller that was a

01:46:21.500 --> 01:46:29.860
counterfeit so you know that's kind of lame that those are out there but I mean

01:46:29.860 --> 01:46:34.940
I can't imagine this is a huge problem that one that warrants a software update

01:46:34.940 --> 01:46:38.980
I mean hell I can think of a lot of problems that this console has it

01:46:38.980 --> 01:46:45.940
haven't been fixed with a software update like home being lame nice all

01:46:45.940 --> 01:46:50.420
right well how would you like to get free Microsoft points that's right free

01:46:50.420 --> 01:46:53.860
Microsoft points well guess what there's a website that will bribe you with free

01:46:53.860 --> 01:46:58.220
Microsoft points they're keeping it in the family because that website is Bing

01:46:58.220 --> 01:47:03.700
that's right Microsoft search engine the rival to Google Bing is running this new

01:47:03.700 --> 01:47:09.500
little like Bing toolbar that you can install on your browser by the way well

01:47:09.500 --> 01:47:12.440
at the first announcement said that it was only compatible with Internet

01:47:12.440 --> 01:47:15.580
Explorer but some things I've been reading in forum chats and stuff say

01:47:15.580 --> 01:47:18.860
that it actually works with Firefox so I don't know you I mean it would make

01:47:18.860 --> 01:47:21.860
sense it would only work with Internet Explorer right that whole like

01:47:21.860 --> 01:47:27.500
Microsoft only stuff but anyhow if you use it to take part in daily promotions

01:47:27.500 --> 01:47:32.120
or do searching you will earn reward points that you can then turn into

01:47:32.120 --> 01:47:36.200
Microsoft points so here's the thing though you can only get the Microsoft

01:47:36.200 --> 01:47:40.460
points in 100 point denominations but just installing the toolbar gets you

01:47:40.460 --> 01:47:45.460
250 points so that's kind of cool I guess so what I'm also hearing though

01:47:45.460 --> 01:47:48.700
again the reading through comments and things is apparently they will only like

01:47:48.700 --> 01:47:58.220
send you the the points in like cards in the mail like what a waste of cardboard

01:47:58.220 --> 01:48:00.940
and all that stuff like when they could be sending it to you digitally cuz like

01:48:00.940 --> 01:48:07.100
you know a hundred Microsoft points is like a buck 25 seriously yeah I'm gonna

01:48:07.100 --> 01:48:11.180
try it with Firefox have fun give me your Microsoft points and Microsoft is

01:48:11.180 --> 01:48:15.860
desperate to get Bing off the ground like they're trying all kinds of stuff

01:48:15.860 --> 01:48:19.540
well you know what's interesting it's not a bad site actually their maps is

01:48:19.540 --> 01:48:23.160
actually really cool and in some ways it's even better than Google like it's

01:48:23.160 --> 01:48:26.500
actually caused Google to have to kind of like up some of the aunties on some

01:48:26.500 --> 01:48:30.220
of their things like the satellite pictures and stuff so you know Bing it

01:48:30.220 --> 01:48:33.220
has some pretty neat stuff going for it I mean it's not terrible just because

01:48:33.220 --> 01:48:39.620
it's Microsoft I keep seeing advertisements and like being this and

01:48:39.620 --> 01:48:43.540
being automatically like download itself on my toolbar and bing bing bing bing

01:48:43.540 --> 01:48:47.820
and it's just like bada-bing and yeah exactly exactly I like that they have

01:48:47.820 --> 01:48:54.260
like a neat little picture every day and they're their application on did it oh

01:48:54.260 --> 01:49:00.100
no did it maybe I was trying to click cancel and I click the other thing so

01:49:00.100 --> 01:49:03.300
now it closed all my windows great and it means you closed your next story

01:49:03.300 --> 01:49:12.180
didn't it yay awesome oh well that's what I have an iPhone for you're gonna

01:49:12.180 --> 01:49:15.860
bring up stories on the iPhone why not all right well I got a stretch for time

01:49:15.860 --> 01:49:19.340
here I was ready to go on to the next story you know what Rob sometimes things

01:49:19.340 --> 01:49:22.980
just don't go the way you expect them to hey don't be rude I wasn't being rude

01:49:22.980 --> 01:49:27.620
being a realist Bing has pretty pictures on it that's not like about being when

01:49:27.620 --> 01:49:31.180
you go to their website and the iPhone app is actually kind of neat I don't

01:49:31.180 --> 01:49:35.620
have an iPhone really would you like to touch mine no it's got your finger juice

01:49:35.620 --> 01:49:45.300
on it yes you may okay have my story yay all right because this is the joy of the

01:49:45.300 --> 01:49:51.940
iPhone oh great now it's not loading sucker me at Miyamoto it basically what

01:49:51.940 --> 01:49:55.620
the story is about is that Miyamoto has always considered the maker of the

01:49:55.620 --> 01:50:01.620
Rubik's Cube mr. Rubik himself to be his rival so he wants to make something

01:50:01.620 --> 01:50:06.980
along the lines of a Rubik's Cube as his big pet project so like selling a

01:50:06.980 --> 01:50:11.780
bazillion wheeze isn't good enough no

01:50:12.500 --> 01:50:18.780
basically he said and I'm gonna quote for quite some time I have viewed

01:50:18.780 --> 01:50:22.700
professor Rubik who created the Rubik's Cube as a sort of rival I've always

01:50:22.700 --> 01:50:25.900
thought it would be cool to create something like a Rubik's Cube I've told

01:50:25.900 --> 01:50:29.380
lots of people about that for 20 years of us thought that the Rubik's cubes are

01:50:29.380 --> 01:50:32.140
great they've all left him and I wanted to make something like that but I still

01:50:32.140 --> 01:50:39.100
haven't tried to do so I must be taking it easy Wow and then he said he wanted

01:50:39.100 --> 01:50:44.460
to be a manga artist oh he just wants to do everything doesn't he you know what

01:50:44.460 --> 01:50:48.660
he's created some of the most memorable video game characters ever like that

01:50:48.660 --> 01:50:53.780
history will never forget some of these video game characters and yet it's just

01:50:53.780 --> 01:51:01.220
not good enough for him no and well he was said that he did some comic strips

01:51:01.220 --> 01:51:06.700
for um Tezuka who's the Nintendo ad general manager wait wait what which

01:51:06.700 --> 01:51:09.940
characters are you talking about that he created you know the ones that we would

01:51:09.940 --> 01:51:14.540
never forget was that like Captain Rainbow or something do you remember

01:51:14.540 --> 01:51:19.820
Captain Rainbow good point from a dark Tetsuya in chat room didn't Nintendo

01:51:19.820 --> 01:51:23.660
used to make toys and stuff back in the 70s actually Nintendo started off as a

01:51:23.660 --> 01:51:28.660
Hanafuda card yeah they did it playing cards right yeah hmm and then they did

01:51:28.660 --> 01:51:35.420
Game & Watch I love Game & Watch it works with Firefox well thank you now I

01:51:35.420 --> 01:51:39.580
enjoy your Microsoft points I will good time what are you gonna buy with those

01:51:39.580 --> 01:51:45.660
Microsoft points probably the rest of the steampunk outfit on my avatar all

01:51:45.660 --> 01:51:50.060
right Loki it's your turn you gonna put down plants versus zombies and actually

01:51:50.060 --> 01:51:56.980
sorry I can do this so there's other Sony news and this would kind of tie in

01:51:56.980 --> 01:52:01.220
with the stuff that happened before when they were moving things to stop hacking

01:52:01.220 --> 01:52:06.740
remember they removed the other OS feature on the PlayStation 3 to stop the

01:52:06.740 --> 01:52:13.180
hacking of the system via Linux well apparently there was a class-action

01:52:13.180 --> 01:52:19.220
lawsuit filed against Sony because of that and Sony has now filed a motion to

01:52:19.220 --> 01:52:23.220
dismiss that class-action lawsuit brought against the company and sadly

01:52:23.220 --> 01:52:29.220
enough I kind of agree with them because well you'll see for example they say

01:52:29.220 --> 01:52:38.380
that I guess apparently some of the seven I guess similar suits they were

01:52:38.380 --> 01:52:42.900
all consolidated their file last thing it says fails to present evidence that

01:52:42.900 --> 01:52:47.140
the company overtly advertise the other OS and its marketing campaigns on the

01:52:47.140 --> 01:52:51.700
p4 on the ps3 packaging which I don't remember them doing either one of those

01:52:51.700 --> 01:52:56.380
but I do remember them talking about it at e3 so or z3 or game developers

01:52:56.380 --> 01:53:01.500
conference camera which one this is Sony also claims that the ps3 warranty

01:53:01.500 --> 01:53:05.460
license agreement in the PlayStation Network terms of service specifically

01:53:05.460 --> 01:53:12.480
provide ps3 purchasers with a license non ownership interest in the software

01:53:12.480 --> 01:53:17.500
and use of the PlayStation Network provided that Sony has the right to

01:53:17.500 --> 01:53:21.900
disable or alter your software features or terminate or limit the access to the

01:53:21.900 --> 01:53:26.820
PlayStation Network it by issuing firmware updates and also I guess that

01:53:26.820 --> 01:53:33.780
apparently people do have the option to keep the other OS by declining the

01:53:33.780 --> 01:53:37.140
update and they just can't access the PlayStation Network

01:53:37.140 --> 01:53:43.220
so in other words in other words they're saying you can access this feature by

01:53:43.220 --> 01:53:49.460
disabling a different feature instead yes also they're saying that because

01:53:49.460 --> 01:53:55.540
some of the the they should you know dismiss the suit because some of the

01:53:55.540 --> 01:54:04.580
plaintiffs did not use the other OS feature in fact there is you have it

01:54:04.580 --> 01:54:08.900
didn't use it in the same way I guess and or just didn't use it all because

01:54:08.900 --> 01:54:15.140
you know they have ways of checking that and so I guess they wouldn't really have

01:54:15.140 --> 01:54:19.580
been affected by it it's some people I think doing a money grab if you ask me

01:54:19.580 --> 01:54:24.940
so I'm sure some people are just like that earlier story we had about APB and

01:54:24.940 --> 01:54:27.460
all the people complaining the yeah but there's some people that are gonna go

01:54:27.460 --> 01:54:30.980
try to get money that really didn't even play APB they just bought it well that's

01:54:30.980 --> 01:54:34.620
different though I mean they'd have proof of purchase of you know APB they

01:54:34.620 --> 01:54:38.660
give them the serial number or something like that that this is a little

01:54:38.660 --> 01:54:45.060
different than saying oh you know I I don't know like for example a

01:54:45.060 --> 01:54:49.900
class-action lawsuit that I was part of just because I hate 24-hour fitness I

01:54:49.900 --> 01:54:53.460
canceled my 24-hour fitness membership and there was a class-action lawsuit

01:54:53.460 --> 01:54:57.020
saying that there was people affected by the fact that when you cancel your

01:54:57.020 --> 01:55:01.780
membership they bill you a couple more times just really yeah did that happen

01:55:01.780 --> 01:55:06.380
to you no it didn't happen to me that's what I still got I got a $5 check I got

01:55:06.380 --> 01:55:11.780
a three month pass to 24-hour fitness I'm like oh garbage thank you it's like

01:55:11.780 --> 01:55:18.060
wonderful I can't wait to go back to the gym I don't like going to thank you this

01:55:18.060 --> 01:55:20.900
is way better than any other compensation you could possibly provide

01:55:20.900 --> 01:55:25.260
me nice very nice Lisa should be able to kick them in the pants or something yeah

01:55:25.260 --> 01:55:29.460
going to our chat room at chat orange laundry calm for such eloquent comments

01:55:29.460 --> 01:55:33.300
such as the one from Toa gak who says Sony can suck a dick what they did was

01:55:33.300 --> 01:55:39.580
wrong do you agree rice princess can Sony suck a dick they probably could

01:55:39.580 --> 01:55:45.460
collectively yeah let's see why not Derek H in our chair room says that's

01:55:45.460 --> 01:55:49.740
like a car company removing your seat belts because you didn't use them that's

01:55:49.740 --> 01:55:52.900
actually a pretty good comparison except for the fact that I don't think the

01:55:52.900 --> 01:55:56.740
other OS is gonna like you know save your life at any point I guess maybe it

01:55:56.740 --> 01:56:05.540
could I guess anything's possible don't make assumptions wrong all right going

01:56:05.540 --> 01:56:11.260
on to more stories in our show here another rumor going around and this is

01:56:11.260 --> 01:56:19.460
about more 3d games I know right I'm already over it but apparently there are

01:56:19.460 --> 01:56:25.060
yet more rumored ports of PlayStation 2 games being remade for the PlayStation

01:56:25.060 --> 01:56:29.240
3 and in 3d one of them I've got to admit sounds really interesting it's the

01:56:29.240 --> 01:56:35.020
Mortal Kombat HD arcade collection and if you're looking at a sample box art

01:56:35.020 --> 01:56:39.820
that's out there it's Mortal Kombat 1 2 and ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 kind of

01:56:39.820 --> 01:56:44.620
redone in HD I gotta admit that being that I love the cheesy Mortal Kombat

01:56:44.620 --> 01:56:47.460
games from back in the day that actually sounds kind of awesome I'm not gonna lie

01:56:47.460 --> 01:56:51.580
being able to you know play that in three in well I wouldn't play in 3d but

01:56:51.580 --> 01:56:57.780
HD and all that jazz not interested rice princess you don't like Mortal Kombat

01:56:57.780 --> 01:57:04.900
it's alright I can play it in its normal form I guess that's true apparently it's

01:57:04.900 --> 01:57:09.580
gonna have stereoscopic 3d support and this is being reported by a French

01:57:09.580 --> 01:57:13.140
gaming website but they have box art to go with it and I don't know it's coming

01:57:13.140 --> 01:57:19.420
out oh well then I believe it what about the Prince of Persia trilogy 3d that's

01:57:19.420 --> 01:57:22.580
the other one that's being remember about that one yet only if it has video

01:57:22.580 --> 01:57:26.580
of Jake Gyllenhaal me I can imagine that they would because everybody's kind of

01:57:26.580 --> 01:57:29.900
jumping on that bandwagon of re-releasing stuff hey I'm okay with

01:57:29.900 --> 01:57:32.740
that Prince of Persia games are pretty awesome it's the sands of time or you're

01:57:32.740 --> 01:57:35.800
within and the two thrones all coming out sounds like they'd be a perfect tie

01:57:35.800 --> 01:57:39.740
in with the DVD release of the movie now wouldn't it wouldn't it and the Mortal

01:57:39.740 --> 01:57:42.780
Kombat HD collection might make the perfect companion piece to the new

01:57:42.780 --> 01:57:47.300
Mortal Kombat game wouldn't it how about Jake Gyllenhaal and the oncoming

01:57:47.300 --> 01:57:53.180
something I don't know never mind I try to make sex jokes around you Robin I

01:57:53.180 --> 01:57:57.460
just can't because I'm distracted by you it's I'm not sure how to take that but I

01:57:57.460 --> 01:58:04.100
think compliment interesting Derek H says they should remake every game with

01:58:04.100 --> 01:58:08.500
parallax backgrounds in 3d that might actually happen on the 3ds actually if

01:58:08.500 --> 01:58:14.260
what we saw at a most a classic gaming Expo I'd even fucking go to that what am

01:58:14.260 --> 01:58:19.980
I thinking at e3 is any indication cuz you know they had like the Xevious this

01:58:19.980 --> 01:58:25.340
old old old Namco game from like the 80s was redone in 3d pac-man yeah they had

01:58:25.340 --> 01:58:30.300
Star Fox was redone they were talking about like redoing ocarina of time

01:58:30.300 --> 01:58:37.060
they're gonna go back and redo all these games in 3d you know why it's because

01:58:37.060 --> 01:58:41.540
they can just take the code they already have tack on 3d and re-release a damn

01:58:41.540 --> 01:58:47.700
game again just like we can take some GameCube games tack on we remote waggle

01:58:47.700 --> 01:58:51.060
and re-release it hey look we're supporting the fans because we released

01:58:51.060 --> 01:58:56.780
lots of games this year new games uh oh I'm sorry that would actually be just

01:58:56.780 --> 01:59:00.900
game you've got to admit a game like pilot wings would be kind of awesome in

01:59:00.900 --> 01:59:04.780
3d like I have to me okay here's the thing though rice friends let's keep

01:59:04.780 --> 01:59:07.900
this in mind I don't like 3d either like I don't like hearing about all these

01:59:07.900 --> 01:59:13.220
movies and things that are in 3d but the 3ds is for some reason is different like

01:59:13.220 --> 01:59:17.060
a you can turn off the 3d when it bugs you because it has a slider that lets

01:59:17.060 --> 01:59:20.620
you adjust the intensity so it's easier on your eyes and it is kind of a neat

01:59:20.620 --> 01:59:24.220
effect I gotta say being able to see the 3d without glasses is kind of cool I

01:59:24.220 --> 01:59:28.420
don't know how long that'll last but here's something that kind of has me

01:59:28.420 --> 01:59:31.300
thinking you know for the longest time we've been wondering where our virtual

01:59:31.300 --> 01:59:34.100
console games on the DSI where our virtual console games and virtual

01:59:34.100 --> 01:59:38.700
consoles kind of slowed up lately what if a lot of these re-releases with 3d

01:59:38.700 --> 01:59:43.860
end up being downloadable games for the DSI like they're gonna re-release these

01:59:43.860 --> 01:59:47.540
games all over again but this time they're in 3d I mean if the price is

01:59:47.540 --> 01:59:52.660
right like five ten dollars could be worth it for some of these games only

01:59:52.660 --> 01:59:56.140
the only the real real classics like I wouldn't buy games like princess tomato

01:59:56.140 --> 01:59:59.980
and salad Kingdom or whatever are what are you talking about my favorite game

01:59:59.980 --> 02:00:05.220
ever shut up no I wouldn't want to play clash and demon head in 3d no you're

02:00:05.220 --> 02:00:09.300
fixing something that's not broken I don't know it it's not worth it to me

02:00:09.300 --> 02:00:14.180
why would I pay for it again you know it was fine how it was before and you know

02:00:14.180 --> 02:00:21.780
if I want 3d I'll just go into real I hear they have 3d in real they

02:00:21.780 --> 02:00:27.460
apparently yes they do so I mean I don't know I'm just not down with the 3d I

02:00:27.460 --> 02:00:31.180
still want a 3ds though you got it you got to check one out when they you know

02:00:31.180 --> 02:00:34.860
I'll watch you play with now does it actually look like the stuffs coming out

02:00:34.860 --> 02:00:38.980
of the screen no it's going into the going in the screen it's like looking

02:00:38.980 --> 02:00:44.100
through a through a window into a three dimension imagine not like they're

02:00:44.100 --> 02:00:51.740
looking for a real window at the naked woman in the window your description

02:00:51.740 --> 02:00:57.580
of it makes me think of like the old head tracking thing with a wiimote hack

02:00:57.580 --> 02:01:00.620
that's what it makes me think of well if you think about how the 3ds really works

02:01:00.620 --> 02:01:04.260
with all the prisms and stuff basically sending a different image to each eye it

02:01:04.260 --> 02:01:10.620
kind of makes sense how it looks when you see it I know but some of it here's

02:01:10.620 --> 02:01:14.300
the thing but then some of the 3d effects what they do is they put the

02:01:14.300 --> 02:01:20.060
main image on the very very back plane so that way when there's 3d effects it

02:01:20.060 --> 02:01:23.420
does look like things are coming forward because they'll put the static image on

02:01:23.420 --> 02:01:26.580
the very last plane in the very back and then things are shooting out like there

02:01:26.580 --> 02:01:29.220
was one little demo they were showing out on the floor that was somebody

02:01:29.220 --> 02:01:32.620
opening a champagne bottle in slow motion and the champagne goes everywhere

02:01:32.620 --> 02:01:36.820
well it's just to show off the technology yeah like all I think of when

02:01:36.820 --> 02:01:42.820
I think of that is just Nintendo saying we're Nintendo give me your money give

02:01:42.820 --> 02:01:47.620
me your money people give them their money I know there's still one console

02:01:47.620 --> 02:01:51.460
and I'm just worried that this one this gimmick fades like it will that the 3ds

02:01:51.460 --> 02:01:54.540
I mean what's you know we you know you hope that would be around for a few

02:01:54.540 --> 02:01:58.100
years but it's just gonna die every seven-year-old is going to want one

02:01:58.100 --> 02:02:01.940
every single seven-year-old here's the thing though it doesn't matter that if

02:02:01.940 --> 02:02:06.140
it if the 3d stuff fails because the other thing they can do is they can have

02:02:06.140 --> 02:02:09.460
a nice because the top screen is like twice the resolution is the bottom

02:02:09.460 --> 02:02:14.340
screen they can have a nice HD screen or they can also just use the extra

02:02:14.340 --> 02:02:21.460
processing power to make really nice games well we'll see again a system is

02:02:21.460 --> 02:02:24.020
only as good as the games that are on it and there are a lot of very promising

02:02:24.020 --> 02:02:28.580
developers hopping in on it although again it's portable gaming and I'm not

02:02:28.580 --> 02:02:32.460
always the biggest fan of portable games but if it can give me something that the

02:02:32.460 --> 02:02:38.660
television games can't 3d in this case might be worth a look I don't know as if

02:02:38.660 --> 02:02:41.820
it has really really really great games that necessitated I'm gonna have to go

02:02:41.820 --> 02:02:47.260
well you can go ahead and spend your money I'm poor I'm just gonna have to go

02:02:47.260 --> 02:02:56.100
buy a virtual boy you can only steal one oh my god that's a great idea no bad

02:02:56.100 --> 02:03:01.100
idea never mind forget I said that all right let's go to the mailbag every week

02:03:01.100 --> 02:03:05.260
you guys send us emails mailbag at orange lounge radio.com dark soccer is

02:03:05.260 --> 02:03:09.460
gonna open up the email bag dive in headfirst try not to drowned under the

02:03:09.460 --> 02:03:13.700
massive emails that are in there try not to inhale into the anthrax that comes

02:03:13.700 --> 02:03:22.060
with the messages you read a few all right this one is from lab rat y2k I

02:03:22.060 --> 02:03:25.580
just finished a journey into my own gaming vault this trip had me play

02:03:25.580 --> 02:03:30.300
earthbound mother in Japan for the SNES for the first time it's like they read

02:03:30.300 --> 02:03:34.840
rice princesses mind I know I can't speak highly enough of this game it had

02:03:34.840 --> 02:03:38.740
a great story and I found that I actually cared about the NPCs additionally

02:03:38.740 --> 02:03:42.380
I truly enjoyed the humor this is something that's been missing from most

02:03:42.380 --> 02:03:46.580
of the recent JRPGs if you haven't covered this on your retro gaming

02:03:46.580 --> 02:03:52.140
segment it would definitely be worth consideration lab rat y2k I concur

02:03:52.140 --> 02:03:56.500
greeting well now if you don't play it all the way to the very very end where

02:03:56.500 --> 02:03:59.500
you actually beat it then be careful because rice princess will make fun of

02:03:59.500 --> 02:04:02.200
you for the rest of your life so you better play it to completion it's true

02:04:02.200 --> 02:04:08.580
don't just play the first town like Rob did I played at least four towns are you

02:04:08.580 --> 02:04:13.100
sure about that I had a full party of people like you don't get that until

02:04:13.100 --> 02:04:19.700
like practically halfway through the game stop laughing at me bitch

02:04:19.700 --> 02:04:25.620
greetings again from Rob above hi I have been hoping and waiting for Verizon to

02:04:25.620 --> 02:04:29.100
get an iPhone contract because I'm shopping for a phone keep on waiting

02:04:29.100 --> 02:04:33.420
let's imagine that if it became reality I have some pretty good reasons to

02:04:33.420 --> 02:04:37.380
believe that apps that use the network for gaming or social networking will not

02:04:37.380 --> 02:04:42.700
work between AT&T and Verizon the only ones that will are the ones that push

02:04:42.700 --> 02:04:46.260
and pull things via the internet like Facebook or Twitter app I think this

02:04:46.260 --> 02:04:48.820
will be an eye-opening disappointment I hope I'm wrong

02:04:48.820 --> 02:04:55.140
imagine iPhones with babies from Rob above I know I'm not sure I follow the

02:04:55.140 --> 02:05:00.740
logic there why they wouldn't work because of them using the networks the

02:05:00.740 --> 02:05:05.140
time for networks I mean if the bandwidth is different than some network

02:05:05.140 --> 02:05:08.700
or some apps might have problems like things like Netflix and so forth but I

02:05:08.700 --> 02:05:12.020
would think that if a Verizon iPhone goes out of the marketplace the band was

02:05:12.020 --> 02:05:15.180
only gonna get better because there's you know gonna be more of it available

02:05:15.180 --> 02:05:18.540
there'll be a bunch of people that get off of AT&T's network that'll make it

02:05:18.540 --> 02:05:21.420
easier for them and then there'll be people on Verizon's now where it's kind

02:05:21.420 --> 02:05:26.940
of like you know spreading it out a little bit I don't know next email hey

02:05:26.940 --> 02:05:32.100
hey with the plans versus zombies talk on last show it brings to focus my

02:05:32.100 --> 02:05:35.820
addiction to the game on Steam looking over my playtime is almost depressing

02:05:35.820 --> 02:05:41.140
portal two hours half-life 2 one of the best first-person shooters made 44

02:05:41.140 --> 02:05:45.580
minutes team fortress 2 2 hours torchlight 8 hours plants versus zombies

02:05:45.580 --> 02:05:50.340
game of the year edition 40 hours Wow hopefully I'll have the chance to give

02:05:50.340 --> 02:05:53.880
the other games the playtime they deserve in the meantime I'm really

02:05:53.880 --> 02:05:57.580
hoping that next year's plants versus zombies DS game will feature the

02:05:57.580 --> 02:06:03.620
multiplayer elements of the 360 release keep us big keep podcasting and stay

02:06:03.620 --> 02:06:07.740
something Robert M it's like the listeners are reading our minds this

02:06:07.740 --> 02:06:10.700
week with the whole like plants versus zombies like everybody's talking about

02:06:10.700 --> 02:06:13.100
how they've been playing that even though that game is a good year or two

02:06:13.100 --> 02:06:19.420
old at this point it's cuz you're psychic Rob shut up no no no okay

02:06:19.420 --> 02:06:23.380
greetings all our it's your favorite your friendly neighborhood turtle here I

02:06:23.380 --> 02:06:26.980
just wanted to thank you so much for the marathon show actually listen to the

02:06:26.980 --> 02:06:32.700
entire podcast in one long day of work I was worn out after that anywho I think

02:06:32.700 --> 02:06:37.660
the idea of Blizzcon is stupid but is anyone besides me pulling out their hair

02:06:37.660 --> 02:06:42.300
while waiting for any news about Diablo 3 back in the day of Diablo 2 I never

02:06:42.300 --> 02:06:47.700
used any form of voiceover IP and still spent hundreds of hours playing it I

02:06:47.700 --> 02:06:52.740
can't imagine the addiction this time around keep up the great work on the

02:06:52.740 --> 02:06:56.820
best structured most informational and best podcast running on the internet to

02:06:56.820 --> 02:07:04.260
your local your loyal turtle in Philly serious turtle a serious turtle yes

02:07:04.260 --> 02:07:07.500
serious turtle I have been pulling my hair out over Diablo 3 in fact I've

02:07:07.500 --> 02:07:12.860
pulled out a whole little clump in the back in a nice little circle but I am

02:07:12.860 --> 02:07:17.820
I'm actually really excited about Diablo 3 all things considered it's it's been

02:07:17.820 --> 02:07:22.100
way too long since the first game World of Warcraft honestly feels like more

02:07:22.100 --> 02:07:25.660
like World of Diablo to me in the way it plays it's just in the Warcraft

02:07:25.660 --> 02:07:30.980
mythology so I'm I'm I'm very excited about Diablo 3 and I think I brought

02:07:30.980 --> 02:07:33.020
this up on the show before I think there's definitely when it comes to

02:07:33.020 --> 02:07:36.260
Blizzard two different camps there's the Starcraft people and there's a Diablo

02:07:36.260 --> 02:07:40.940
people and not a lot of crossover I appreciate Starcraft I bought it it's

02:07:40.940 --> 02:07:44.820
fun I see why people like it but I didn't really play it to completion

02:07:44.820 --> 02:07:48.700
because I never play games completion anymore let's face it but Diablo 3 oh

02:07:48.700 --> 02:07:59.060
it's on because you're not Korean yes it's because I'm not Korean no I'm

02:07:59.060 --> 02:08:04.420
reading anyway dear olr I was listening to Loki's failtastic Apple metaphor and

02:08:04.420 --> 02:08:08.620
thought I'd take a crack at it so I want to take me and a bunch of my friends out

02:08:08.620 --> 02:08:12.380
to a restaurant I could just get takeout and have a party at home but I like the

02:08:12.380 --> 02:08:15.860
experience that comes with dining out also I don't want my house getting

02:08:15.860 --> 02:08:19.860
trashed so I treat my friends to dinner at a semi-fine restaurant paying for the

02:08:19.860 --> 02:08:23.340
entire meal because I'm a nerd with a full-time job the restaurant presumably

02:08:23.340 --> 02:08:26.900
includes the cost of the dining experience waiters dishes silverware bad

02:08:26.900 --> 02:08:31.500
music random crap on the walls etc in with the cost of the meal because if

02:08:31.500 --> 02:08:34.780
people saw what this actually cost they might not choose to enjoy the dining

02:08:34.780 --> 02:08:39.820
experience this cost comes to me because I'm the one paying however if the

02:08:39.820 --> 02:08:42.780
restaurant is an establishment that makes each individual person pay for

02:08:42.780 --> 02:08:46.620
their own dining experience and I'm not going to stand out in front of a

02:08:46.620 --> 02:08:51.260
restaurant yell fuck you and fuck your fucking dining fee instead I will give

02:08:51.260 --> 02:08:54.140
my business to different restaurant that doesn't charge outrageous dining fees

02:08:54.140 --> 02:08:58.340
that ladies and gentlemen is how to craft a metaphor stay black

02:08:58.340 --> 02:09:02.980
entertainment this message is brought to you by 2x plus 2y minus 8 equals 4y

02:09:02.980 --> 02:09:11.300
solve for X the answer by the way is X equals 4y minus y plus 4 sorry you

02:09:11.300 --> 02:09:15.940
weren't here when that happened Danja we had a caller on the show and Dan was

02:09:15.940 --> 02:09:19.180

02:09:43.540 --> 02:09:46.140

open at 1877 game olr or our username on skype is orange launcher do but not yet

02:13:05.780 --> 02:13:10.180
because we have two more stories to go look yeah yes um I told people to get

02:13:10.180 --> 02:13:13.800
their dialing fingers ready they're dialing fingers it's like playing flame

02:13:13.800 --> 02:13:25.100
and finger I'm waiting Microsoft getting a taste of money because of halo reach

02:13:25.100 --> 02:13:30.020
has decided you know what maybe one halo game every three years not frequent

02:13:30.020 --> 02:13:36.060
enough we need to be putting out more halo games and they're saying you know

02:13:36.060 --> 02:13:42.900
probably I guess Phil Spencer this is Microsoft's VP they're saying it's a

02:13:42.900 --> 02:13:47.140
matter of keeping players engaged and not going dark for two years at a time

02:13:47.140 --> 02:13:51.980
they want to do what Activision has done with Call of Duty which is whore that

02:13:51.980 --> 02:13:58.880
bitch out like no other and they said I used to look at annual releases of non

02:13:58.880 --> 02:14:04.460
sports games as people just like just trying to milk me I figured nobody had

02:14:04.460 --> 02:14:07.940
enough time to do a good job and all the negatives that would associate with

02:14:07.940 --> 02:14:11.780
those kinds of scenarios kudos Activision because they've done a good

02:14:11.780 --> 02:14:17.740
job putting good game continuing to release each year I think the fans like

02:14:17.740 --> 02:14:23.620
it and it's a good thing that they do it that way that's because they had two

02:14:23.620 --> 02:14:28.700
different developers working on it I don't know if that's gonna work with

02:14:28.700 --> 02:14:34.380
halo do you think that halo is just gonna go really downhill now that a

02:14:34.380 --> 02:14:38.500
different studios gonna be developing it oh yeah I mean especially if it sounds

02:14:38.500 --> 02:14:41.060
like they're gonna try to crank them out as fast as possible that sounds

02:14:41.060 --> 02:14:45.860
dangerous just do not put roughing games on halo because they really fucked up

02:14:45.860 --> 02:14:52.820
crackdown too um do you think they're gonna try and crank out a halo game

02:14:52.820 --> 02:14:56.900
again as early as next year that because if that's the case and somebody's

02:14:56.900 --> 02:15:02.700
already working on it I don't know we'll have to see I it's just gonna get to the

02:15:02.700 --> 02:15:07.180
point though see with Call of Duty even you know the modern warfare was really

02:15:07.180 --> 02:15:12.460
awesome and then modern warfare 2 was still very awesome and world at war that

02:15:12.460 --> 02:15:16.420
came out in between that was just kind of like it's alright but still people

02:15:16.420 --> 02:15:20.660
went and played the one game so people aren't necessarily buying every year's

02:15:20.660 --> 02:15:24.820
you know iteration of the game and that's also another thing that's really

02:15:24.820 --> 02:15:27.660
hard to do it when you're putting a really good multiplayer game is like

02:15:27.660 --> 02:15:32.300
halo reach for example people will be playing halo region till the next halo

02:15:32.300 --> 02:15:36.980
game comes out but if it keeps coming out each year and if like some of them

02:15:36.980 --> 02:15:43.500
happen to suck or maybe are made by Treyarch then people might not give a

02:15:43.500 --> 02:15:50.220
shit anymore I just you know I hope they don't take a respectable name and really

02:15:50.220 --> 02:15:55.860
drive it into the ground but then again fresh blood isn't always a bad thing it

02:15:55.860 --> 02:15:59.660
could be cool just most of the time it could be cool but the thing is like

02:15:59.660 --> 02:16:06.460
Microsoft they need more franchises seein you know fables a great game I

02:16:06.460 --> 02:16:16.420
guess I fucking hate peeler Molinos so much why he's such a prick seriously our

02:16:16.420 --> 02:16:19.980
game is so awesome it does all these things other games don't do you're gonna

02:16:19.980 --> 02:16:24.860
really care for this dog really I cared so much I stopped playing months ago

02:16:24.860 --> 02:16:30.540
this dog's gonna come your life no he's annoying he's like hey dig here there's

02:16:30.540 --> 02:16:34.860
treasure here dig here dig here dig here there's treasure here you can raise your

02:16:34.860 --> 02:16:39.700
family and it's so wonderful this time you're gonna be able to be the king or

02:16:39.700 --> 02:16:43.340
queen of your kingdom you have to run it and things are gonna happen you're gonna

02:16:43.340 --> 02:16:48.380
have your dog still because everybody loves dog and and it's really amazing

02:16:48.380 --> 02:16:53.540
and we're gonna do this project Milo shit that's gonna be so wonderful you're

02:16:53.540 --> 02:16:57.500
gonna interact with this kid like you're interacting with a real kid don't play

02:16:57.500 --> 02:17:00.460
with your kids your kids can interact with this kid just like you're

02:17:00.460 --> 02:17:07.900
interacting with real friends because they don't have real friends oh he's

02:17:07.900 --> 02:17:14.580
just so annoying with his leg new technology and shit and I'm sorry like

02:17:14.580 --> 02:17:18.580
here's the thing he comes out saying that these games are gonna be so much

02:17:18.580 --> 02:17:23.500
more incredible than the last game because of all these reasons and they're

02:17:23.500 --> 02:17:27.980
like nearly identical to the last year's release it's like what happened all this

02:17:27.980 --> 02:17:30.580
innovation that you're gonna put in there because this game is kind of

02:17:30.580 --> 02:17:34.700
terrible well no and why don't we go back to the original scrap Milo because

02:17:34.700 --> 02:17:39.140
yeah that's stupid and creepy and we can do we can do the we'll get an adult guy

02:17:39.140 --> 02:17:43.780
an adult woman and then integrate porn into the games I'm glad that they were

02:17:43.780 --> 02:17:46.900
able to show off this wonderful tech demo where they can interact with a

02:17:46.900 --> 02:17:51.540
child and stuff but like if you actually heard about what the game was supposed

02:17:51.540 --> 02:17:56.060
to be about it was stupid it was just like oh you interact with this child and

02:17:56.060 --> 02:18:00.340
if you help them find snails because he's moved here from it from isn't that

02:18:00.340 --> 02:18:05.260
connect animals no no no they make my little okay it's not connect to humans

02:18:05.260 --> 02:18:10.980
okay it's a child it's a real boy like Pinocchio he wants to be a real boy but

02:18:10.980 --> 02:18:16.260
he's just digital and you interact with him he helped by snails because he's

02:18:16.260 --> 02:18:20.900
just so depressed from flying here from I think he was coming from Britain or

02:18:20.900 --> 02:18:24.140
something like that and somewhere in England flying from England doesn't know

02:18:24.140 --> 02:18:29.660
anybody and his parents are going through some hard times maybe divorce or

02:18:29.660 --> 02:18:35.500
something and that's this is way more anger than I was anticipating your Jeff

02:18:35.500 --> 02:18:39.580
Goldblum voice is just no it's is it's the Peter molyneaux voice that's how he

02:18:39.580 --> 02:18:43.340
talks going to chat that orange hundred calm salacious pop says damn Loki why

02:18:43.340 --> 02:18:48.020
you mad though amazed that suma says Loki's British accent sucks it's not a

02:18:48.020 --> 02:18:52.020
project it's a Peter molyneaux accident oh he talked dark Tetsuya says well I

02:18:52.020 --> 02:18:56.100
think Loki's British accent beats Rob's I'm not trying to sound British I'm

02:18:56.100 --> 02:19:00.380
trying to sound like Peter moly no I'm Mel B and today we're going to be talking

02:19:00.380 --> 02:19:06.940
about fable Rob this bloody old fool bloody old fool she's trying to do also

02:19:06.940 --> 02:19:12.020
buy my new game L be blah blah blah girl power let's put another girl through

02:19:12.020 --> 02:19:19.420
patience you know remember when he is pimping out halo or not halo yeah it's

02:19:19.420 --> 02:19:25.820
pimping out halo Milo in there no no he was pimping out fucking fable to he's

02:19:25.820 --> 02:19:32.020
like oh no I'm gonna show you something very innovative it's a ball you play you

02:19:32.020 --> 02:19:39.540
play fetch with the dog with the ball it's like I can fucking do that now with

02:19:39.540 --> 02:19:44.140
my dog I don't have a dog I can throw a ball at my cat and it's way more

02:19:44.140 --> 02:19:48.940
entertaining than playing who's like who seriously is gonna go into halo and play

02:19:48.940 --> 02:19:53.380
fetch your fucking dog for hours on end is this what I'm really paying money for

02:19:53.380 --> 02:19:58.260
is to play fetch my fucking dog mm-hmm granted it was fun killing people or

02:19:58.260 --> 02:20:03.380
like torturing them in this little like you know device you can sacrifice real

02:20:03.380 --> 02:20:09.060
life you can kill people in real life you act like it's impossible it's

02:20:09.060 --> 02:20:14.860
entirely possible we have salacious pop in chat says that this is Loki right now

02:20:14.860 --> 02:20:43.940
actually this is Loki right now I apologize that that was very low volume

02:20:43.940 --> 02:20:51.020
playing YouTube I bet you anything though that fable 3 is going to be very

02:20:51.020 --> 02:20:56.740
very very very very similar to fable 2 ok dark soccer is finally giving me back

02:20:56.740 --> 02:21:00.780
my clue DVD it's only been two years since she's had it no Rob it's been

02:21:00.780 --> 02:21:04.780
longer feels like you have like three movies in here me too I'm gonna watch

Nintendo will sue at least that's what they've been doing this week threatening

02:21:19.820 --> 02:21:24.100
to do they've been threatening Pokemon fan sites who have been posting Pokemon

02:21:24.100 --> 02:21:27.940
black and white screenshots the game came out in Japan and of course you

02:21:27.940 --> 02:21:31.060
know folks have been importing it and have been posting screenshots of it on

02:21:31.060 --> 02:21:35.540
their fan sites but Nintendo has brought down the legal hammer of justice with a

02:21:35.540 --> 02:21:38.860
cease and desist saying quote while Nintendo appreciates your interest in

02:21:38.860 --> 02:21:41.940
and support of the Pokemon game series your publication of this content

02:21:41.940 --> 02:21:45.500
infringes Nintendo's copyrights in violation of federal law your activity

02:21:45.500 --> 02:21:48.780
also and has the potential caught to cause substantial damage to Nintendo and

02:21:48.780 --> 02:21:51.980
leaves Nintendo with no choice but to take steps to protect its intellectual

02:21:51.980 --> 02:21:57.220
property rights some of the sites that were hit poker beach pokey beach I don't

02:21:57.220 --> 02:22:03.660
know and your beach poker be check up your Pokemon sorry be I don't know if

02:22:03.660 --> 02:22:06.940
that's one of the names of the Pokemon is Siri be or something and of course

02:22:06.940 --> 02:22:11.060
they're very upset no and this is awesome because Nintendo is so epically

02:22:11.060 --> 02:22:14.900
horrible at advertising their own stuff now yes they're going to get pissed off

02:22:14.900 --> 02:22:18.180
apparently when other people actually try to advertise for them like that's

02:22:18.180 --> 02:22:21.580
that's amazing it's also kind of disturbing to me that it's like well the

02:22:21.580 --> 02:22:25.420
game's out somewhere but hold on because there was an update that came out to

02:22:25.420 --> 02:22:29.380
this that might kind of shed a little light on it and it was you know some

02:22:29.380 --> 02:22:33.100
various commenters on websites were kind of noticing that the sites that got shut

02:22:33.100 --> 02:22:40.340
down were admitting to using ROMs to get the screens so maybe the problem wasn't

02:22:40.340 --> 02:22:43.820
that they were posting screenshots but it's admitting how they did it by

02:22:43.820 --> 02:22:48.620
getting ROMs of an import game I mean still screenshots are just screenshots

02:22:48.620 --> 02:22:51.820
and the game is already out but you know if you're gonna go around openly saying

02:22:51.820 --> 02:22:56.740
I stole the game what if I said you know I wished upon a magic lamp and the gene

02:22:56.740 --> 02:23:00.980
granted me this copy of the game are they gonna shut down my Pokemon site

02:23:00.980 --> 02:23:05.740
now well then maybe I don't know I mean I could say that it fell from the sky

02:23:05.740 --> 02:23:10.380
in a blaze of glory or you just don't say how you got the screenshots at all

02:23:10.380 --> 02:23:13.900
you just post them I mean isn't that what most websites do but Rob that would

02:23:13.900 --> 02:23:18.780
be like they get their exclusive report we got the exclusive photoshop those

02:23:18.780 --> 02:23:22.940
those are photoshop I don't believe that Pokemon has that in there also keep in

02:23:22.940 --> 02:23:31.180

controller simple as that what stuff falls apart within like two three months

02:30:41.820 --> 02:30:47.460
yeah that would suck if I put a pair of um symbols from my drop for my own rock

02:30:47.460 --> 02:30:51.460
band drum set they stopped working within three months are they pretty

02:30:51.460 --> 02:30:56.100
cheap though I mean is it like you get what you pay for something like that I

02:30:56.100 --> 02:30:59.660
mean the current I got him replaced and I use them sparingly and as they're

02:30:59.660 --> 02:31:03.340
starting to act up a little bit here and there well they have updated them for

02:31:03.340 --> 02:31:06.500
the rock band three drum set since they actually included with that now and

02:31:06.500 --> 02:31:09.900
they're supposed to be more sensitive once rock band three out I want to play

02:31:09.900 --> 02:31:18.380

02:31:31.700 --> 02:31:35.660
umlaut that's coming up in December it's this thing they do in San Francisco at

02:31:35.660 --> 02:31:40.780
the DNA lounge where you can actually like you I don't want to say rent the

02:31:40.780 --> 02:31:44.780
stage but you sort of do like you get to play a song on stage in front of like

02:31:44.780 --> 02:31:47.780
all the people that are there it's like a concert where you're a band so I'm

02:31:47.780 --> 02:31:51.860
thinking the doctor and rice princess and I should do a band would it be fun

02:31:51.860 --> 02:31:56.460
yay I tried to get my friend Victoria to do it but she's kind of being flaky

02:31:56.460 --> 02:31:59.540
flake on it no I would definitely do that would you yeah oh heck yeah but we

02:31:59.540 --> 02:32:04.300
have to dress up okay enter grok side yeah what does it dark sakura we need to

02:32:04.300 --> 02:32:09.180

Beatles rock band harmony like rock star saying I was just grimacing musically

02:32:34.380 --> 02:32:40.380
okay good stuff I think this is gonna have to happen what do you think Rama

02:32:40.380 --> 02:32:43.500
you have to get on stage to see in front of hundreds of people know it what's

02:32:43.500 --> 02:32:48.180
that I said I'm all for it awesome awesome I have to get over my stage

02:32:48.180 --> 02:32:52.860
right now you'll be fine just put a paper bag on your head and cut out little

02:32:52.860 --> 02:32:58.380
like like like in um um guitar hero you can do on guitar freakin um put a

02:32:58.380 --> 02:33:04.300
bucket of chicken thing on your head it's hard like bucket head there you go

02:33:04.300 --> 02:33:09.700
no I'm talking I was you know like the little icon guys from guitar freaks

02:33:09.700 --> 02:33:14.740
you know that game that was made by that could be our band name guitar freaks was

02:33:14.740 --> 02:33:20.380
first well if you want I give you permission to use my band name what's

02:33:20.380 --> 02:33:36.540
that rhythm in Jews Rama Jews have no rhythm come on come on I tease because

02:33:36.540 --> 02:33:41.940
I suggested that I could play with one arm like the drummer for a definitely

02:33:41.940 --> 02:33:44.940
actually that's an amazing idea because what you should do you should do that

02:33:44.940 --> 02:33:46.900
whole thing where you put your hand through your shirt so it looks like you

02:33:46.900 --> 02:33:52.020
don't have an arm awesome because he has a floor pad maybe we can put it on the

02:33:52.020 --> 02:33:55.340
floor and I can hit it with my feet only if you only if you kick your legs back

02:33:55.340 --> 02:33:58.540
in a wheelchair it's not like your lieutenant Dan it's it's Halloween time

02:33:58.540 --> 02:34:02.540
so he she could we go to a Halloween store and get you one of those fake

02:34:02.540 --> 02:34:11.660
arms always been lobbed off I'll be awesome that's okay it was a good idea

02:34:11.660 --> 02:34:15.780
at the time I know right we'll just get dark soccer good and drunk before she

02:34:15.780 --> 02:34:19.820
goes on stage alright drunk I won't be able to say why do I get a drug just

02:34:19.820 --> 02:34:23.660
bribe her with Guinness that here's the best part guys this doesn't get me they

02:34:23.660 --> 02:34:30.660
stream loud on the internet so all of you could watch never mind I'll get the

02:34:30.660 --> 02:34:36.340
recorder ready and it'll be good act F suggests instrument freaks or band

02:34:36.340 --> 02:34:42.100
freaks which is facts maniacs which is great because there's people from

02:34:42.100 --> 02:34:45.860
harmonics that actually go to the event and it would be extremely offensive if

02:34:45.860 --> 02:34:48.020
we named although I don't know if any people are harmonious is they're

02:34:48.020 --> 02:34:53.140
wonderful people but it would be funny could be freaky guitarists we could be

02:34:53.140 --> 02:35:03.060
the five seven threes we know we could be the Spice Girls we could dress up as

02:35:03.060 --> 02:35:07.620
Spice Girls more like the shy girls I get to be Jerry that's all all right

02:35:07.620 --> 02:35:13.700
forget it hi Rama anything else you want to share with our listeners I just got

02:35:13.700 --> 02:35:17.700
one thing to say I'm gonna quick I'm tired of everybody bitching at me that

02:35:17.700 --> 02:35:21.060

so you get to some more people but I just want to quickly throw this out here

02:37:11.780 --> 02:37:15.720
do you know how we used to learn Spanish in high school you'd probably get a kick

02:37:15.720 --> 02:37:21.540
out of this no I haven't okay there's this little song and I still remember it

to this day and it's how you learn how to conjugate verbs okay you ready

02:37:25.300 --> 02:37:34.860
vamos hablar el verbo kami nar kami nar kami nar to walk yo kami no tu kami nace

02:37:34.860 --> 02:37:39.220
el kami nay it was dead Tom B and I still remember this song to this day is

02:37:39.220 --> 02:37:44.940
pathetic French horrible what did you think didn't have any song what did you

02:37:44.940 --> 02:37:51.060
think of the verb conjugation song wasn't it awesome oh yeah all right so

02:37:51.060 --> 02:37:55.820
speaking of video games what's up in video game world yeah video games so

02:37:55.820 --> 02:38:01.860
interesting oh I wanted to talk about a story to talk about last week about a

02:38:01.860 --> 02:38:09.140
certain video game side that sells all games ah yes that site that went up and

02:38:09.140 --> 02:38:13.340
down and then up again oh I think they're still down though because we're

02:38:13.340 --> 02:38:20.180
definitely not covering the story that they came back I'm aware that they're

02:38:20.180 --> 02:38:24.740
still down there went my final story of the night oh what would you want to say

02:38:24.740 --> 02:38:29.900
about the site that shall not be named well not necessarily about the site but

02:38:29.900 --> 02:38:37.620
about like steam and other sites like I don't remember the other right direct to

02:38:37.620 --> 02:38:47.780
drive also that sell games the digital distribution distribution well I'm you

02:38:47.780 --> 02:38:50.380
know it has a lot of people kind of thinking about digital distribution with

02:38:50.380 --> 02:38:53.540
the website going down it's kind of like a lot of people were giving it second

02:38:53.540 --> 02:38:57.340
thought like gee is one day all my games just going to suddenly stop working now

02:38:57.340 --> 02:39:03.540
to be fair I believe the games that the website got me with a pitchfork was

02:39:03.540 --> 02:39:09.700
selling they were DRM free right and then steam has always said if they ever

02:39:09.700 --> 02:39:14.060
go down they do have this magic key that will unlock the DRM and all the games

02:39:14.060 --> 02:39:17.740
and they have like a panic button they can hit they'll automatically make all

02:39:17.740 --> 02:39:20.620
the games DRM free and I'm surprised hackers haven't found it yet but it must

02:39:20.620 --> 02:39:24.620
be I think they might have it must be a patch or something I don't know but you

02:39:24.620 --> 02:39:32.460
know they there is a way out but yeah it's kind of worrying because I have a

02:39:32.460 --> 02:39:39.140
lot of games I have bought and given to me on steam so I kind of I kind of worry

02:39:39.140 --> 02:39:44.780
about that where I think it's going to be down someday I think you'll be okay

02:39:44.780 --> 02:39:48.620
if you read the terms of service for steam it sounds like you'll be okay now

02:39:48.620 --> 02:39:51.500
here's the one you would worry about honestly if I were you was be that on

02:39:51.500 --> 02:39:55.580
live as neat as that service is and this scale cool as it looks at the whole

02:39:55.580 --> 02:39:58.900
streaming game through the internet or whatever when you buy those games you're

02:39:58.900 --> 02:40:01.900
basically buying the game on someone else's computer and if that service ever

02:40:01.900 --> 02:40:07.100
goes down you're gonna lose that game now I think they've excuse me they've

02:40:07.100 --> 02:40:12.340
guaranteed it for what like three years I think but that's you know after that

02:40:12.340 --> 02:40:15.060
three years you may not have the game anymore which you know after three years

02:40:15.060 --> 02:40:17.700
you may not want to play the game anymore but I don't know there's some

02:40:17.700 --> 02:40:20.980
games I want to go back and visit after a long time like the very first

02:40:20.980 --> 02:40:25.300
civilization I could still play that game it's great and no I didn't place it

02:40:25.300 --> 02:40:33.780
five this week I'm a bad sieve fan anyhow well good thing on live it's it's

02:40:33.780 --> 02:40:37.980
I think it's not available in Mexico so I don't have to worry about that

02:40:37.980 --> 02:40:44.940
hopefully someday as always get last in line I'm sorry yeah all right well any

02:40:44.940 --> 02:40:49.980

in right now let's take it thank you for calling orange lounge radio right you're

02:41:39.460 --> 02:41:45.100
online with the doctor what's up hey this is entertainment hey what's up

02:41:45.100 --> 02:41:50.540
what's on your mind I want to bitch about PSN for a second okay right on

02:41:50.540 --> 02:41:56.460
well I got move and I downloaded a couple demos because I didn't get the

02:41:56.460 --> 02:42:05.540
$99 package with the demo disk in it okay so I I set this up to download

02:42:05.540 --> 02:42:10.700
overnight and usually I can go to work or set stuff to download overnight on

02:42:10.700 --> 02:42:18.260
live and it'll be done when I wake up or get home so I wake up and the thing is

02:42:18.260 --> 02:42:26.340
and my PlayStation 3 is still on I'm serious it's still trying to download well

02:42:26.340 --> 02:42:31.940
no it downloaded overnight but it took at least eight hours because I went to

02:42:31.940 --> 02:42:37.540
sleep about 2 a.m. and left to go see a movie at about 11 and it was still on oh

02:42:37.540 --> 02:42:42.540
wait what was it you were trying to download just the the patch or seven

02:42:42.540 --> 02:42:48.020
seven demos for move Wow and none of them were any bigger than about three

02:42:48.020 --> 02:42:52.300
hundred fifty max it wasn't the same no it wasn't the same day the network went

02:42:52.300 --> 02:42:55.700
down right it's just it maybe they were just getting hammered I don't know that's

02:42:55.700 --> 02:43:00.860
so it's kind of freaky you know you can buy full games on PSN can she has like

02:43:00.860 --> 02:43:04.620
gigs and gigs of data that would just take you hours like you could just go

02:43:04.620 --> 02:43:09.460
out the door drive to the mall downtown and back in less time than it would take

02:43:09.460 --> 02:43:13.660
for the stupid game to download digital distribution might not really be the

02:43:13.660 --> 02:43:17.680
wave of the future just yet it works for the smaller games like on Xbox Live

02:43:17.680 --> 02:43:22.180
Arcade and you know some of the smaller PSN games but that's crazy I imagine

02:43:22.180 --> 02:43:25.380
just a bunch of people were hitting it all at once but it's kind of surprising

02:43:25.380 --> 02:43:29.420
they don't have a better backup system you know for that well a lot of people

02:43:29.420 --> 02:43:34.780
must be trying to download the heavy rain move patch now because I triggered

02:43:34.780 --> 02:43:41.940
it to download at about 9 o'clock which is 8 Pacific and it's been about an hour

02:43:41.940 --> 02:43:49.860
and it says it's 16% complete and it will take 324 minutes left oh that's

02:43:49.860 --> 02:43:53.900
ridiculous do you have points running I mean maybe your porn torrents are

02:43:53.900 --> 02:43:57.460
clogging everything that could be the job no the only thing I'm doing right

02:43:57.460 --> 02:44:03.780
now is I'm calling you on my iPad huh and that's it this is pretty good

02:44:03.780 --> 02:44:11.220
quality for an iPad I must say huh well I I don't know sir I you could call Sony

02:44:11.220 --> 02:44:13.900
and complain or you could just bitch about it on internet forums like you're

02:44:13.900 --> 02:44:19.420
doing now yeah most people are going to be doing I mean what can you do the

02:44:19.420 --> 02:44:23.380
internet is for yeah exactly it's for bitching anonymously on internet forums

02:44:23.380 --> 02:44:27.780
about your products yeah anything else you want to complain about while you're

02:44:27.780 --> 02:44:34.500
on no I was I did finally play some of the demos and they're really good the

02:44:34.500 --> 02:44:40.540
tumble demo is really nice mm-hmm and so is ruse which is kind of what I've

02:44:40.540 --> 02:44:47.140
always wanted from wiimote from out of the week do you think it's do you think

02:44:47.140 --> 02:44:53.380
that this the PlayStation might have a serious competitor here to the Wii I

02:44:53.380 --> 02:44:58.900
don't know it all depends on the games right right but it sounds like you were

02:44:58.900 --> 02:45:03.980
enjoying a couple of these demos yeah the ruse demo is kind of this

02:45:03.980 --> 02:45:10.260
militaristic strategy game which I might have to pick that up when it finally

02:45:10.260 --> 02:45:15.500
comes out I don't know I still haven't got the move myself yet maybe maybe at

02:45:15.500 --> 02:45:18.260
some point or I'll just go over to Loki and play his that sounds like an even

02:45:18.260 --> 02:45:22.820
better idea right Loki yeah all right I haven't even played mine yet any other

02:45:22.820 --> 02:45:27.140
last thoughts before we let you go that's about it all right just don't

02:45:27.140 --> 02:45:30.060
forget to turn off the port hopefully someday I will be able to play heavy

02:45:30.060 --> 02:45:35.940
rain with move all right well let us know maybe next week and maybe it might

up salacious pop that much I'm calling in so everyone can hear my hot sexy I

02:46:12.740 --> 02:46:17.400
have a chest cold bro voice ah dude I love the bro voice yeah I'm gonna go put

02:46:17.400 --> 02:46:24.780
on like a Dave Matthews band CD and put on a visor sideways like a great visual

02:46:24.780 --> 02:46:30.200
yeah keep talking keep talking I was calling about Ronda's comment that mad

02:46:30.200 --> 02:46:34.420
cats really just needs to stop making controllers okay I have a little story

02:46:34.420 --> 02:46:39.380
about that awesome I used I bought one of their like eight

02:46:39.380 --> 02:46:44.780
and one memory sticks for the Dreamcast where it has a switch on it it died

02:46:44.780 --> 02:46:48.780
after like a month it deleted all my saves no I love that it not only died

02:46:48.780 --> 02:46:53.220
but it deleted them that's that's amazing yeah and then since he was

02:46:53.220 --> 02:47:00.180
talking about controllers I bought a Blanca six button the fighting pad for

02:47:00.180 --> 02:47:05.580
the 360 when Street Fighter 4 came out and I got it off I think eBay it was

02:47:05.580 --> 02:47:08.740
brand new it was in like the horrible clamshell where you need like a box

02:47:08.740 --> 02:47:13.660
cutter and a living sacrifice to get the fuck it's open and meanwhile you break

02:47:13.660 --> 02:47:17.540
the product is you're opening yeah yeah it didn't work like it was just dead out

02:47:17.540 --> 02:47:21.320
of the box the 360 was like I don't know what the fuck you just connected to me

02:47:21.320 --> 02:47:25.860
but this is doubt it get that get this away from me so I said like 40 bucks on

02:47:25.860 --> 02:47:30.220
a mad cat's controller that was just dead like that's awesome so they need to

02:47:30.220 --> 02:47:36.100
stop very good yeah I agree with all those stories I would probably buy one

02:47:36.100 --> 02:47:42.920
just to you know step on it and kick the grass room I can hear Rob giggling hi hi

02:47:42.920 --> 02:47:49.020
feel better fine also since you guys are talking about the Tomb Raider reboot I

02:47:49.020 --> 02:47:52.980
really think that no one Kerr about Lara Croft anymore and that they need to put

02:47:52.980 --> 02:47:56.700
that franchise to bed because there are so many bad games associated with that

02:47:56.700 --> 02:48:00.940
hold on you enjoyed that Lara Croft in the guardian light game as much as I did

02:48:00.940 --> 02:48:05.180
unless you were lying for my benefit no see that's the thing that's an awesome

02:48:05.180 --> 02:48:10.180
game no it is but because it has Lara Croft and Tomb Raider attached to it

02:48:10.180 --> 02:48:14.100
like that's the brand people are gonna go oh you know what's this shit and

02:48:14.100 --> 02:48:18.500
they're not gonna buy it I think that's what if if that co-op game was put under

02:48:18.500 --> 02:48:22.180
a new IP with new characters people would go oh this is a great game because

02:48:22.180 --> 02:48:27.900
it is but just the Tomb Raider games for the ps2 were awful three four five for

02:48:27.900 --> 02:48:34.100
the ps1 were awful so I just feel that this kind of box office poison like I

02:48:34.100 --> 02:48:37.980
don't know she's Lara Croft is Lara Croft is the M night Shyamalan of video

02:48:37.980 --> 02:48:42.060
games you pretty much like they just they don't care you know she was genre

02:48:42.060 --> 02:48:47.420
breaking in 96 with her you know platforming and her bad pyramid tips but

02:48:47.420 --> 02:48:53.700
now no one cares no wonder no one care about Lara Croft which is which is a

02:48:53.700 --> 02:48:57.260
shame because I think that you know I'd often still put out good games with her

02:48:57.260 --> 02:49:01.660
it's just that she as an icon is bringing their ideas down I don't know

02:49:01.660 --> 02:49:06.740
do you think maybe they got one more chance like maybe this reboot if it's

02:49:06.740 --> 02:49:11.140
really good maybe people can look past it and forgive or no it's over put it

02:49:11.140 --> 02:49:15.140
pasture didn't I thought the game the adventure game that they put out for her

02:49:15.140 --> 02:49:19.500
last year or the year before I think it's for the ps3 was also supposed to

02:49:19.500 --> 02:49:23.900
be really good but like again I've never really heard of that like once it came

02:49:23.900 --> 02:49:29.000
out no one cared and it never really broke any sales charts so I think it may

02:49:29.000 --> 02:49:32.220
just be a done deal I guess with the reboot if they'd have to put a lot of

02:49:32.220 --> 02:49:36.060
money into marketing it to say like no really guys this was actually good or

02:49:36.060 --> 02:49:40.540
just put the topless patch in honestly and then boys everywhere want to play

02:49:40.540 --> 02:49:44.340
right just just release it on PC in the skidding community will take care of

you for calling orange lounge radio you're online with the doctor what's up

02:50:58.660 --> 02:51:06.140
hey what's up suppose what's that I'm on with the doctor you're on with the

02:51:06.140 --> 02:51:09.940
doctor I'm the doctor is there any aliens I need to be worrying about them

02:51:09.940 --> 02:51:13.540
ah there's tons of aliens dude I got my son a screwdriver and I'm ready to go

02:51:13.540 --> 02:51:19.940
oh shit I gotta run we better because there is an awful lot of running so we

02:51:19.940 --> 02:51:27.100
definitely need to do that so besides the aliens what's going on tonight with

02:51:27.100 --> 02:51:32.020
you wait who is that hi who is this this is zappy hi zappy how are you

02:51:32.020 --> 02:51:36.740
I'm pretty good okay I'll let's talk to doctor yet okay well the reason was

02:51:36.740 --> 02:51:40.260
talking good call in was because it's sort of related to what rare team was

02:51:40.260 --> 02:51:46.140
talking about before is because I have a copy of ruse but for the Xbox 360 and

02:51:46.140 --> 02:51:53.580
let me tell you that controller is in isn't cutting it like it's I can see

02:51:53.580 --> 02:51:58.140
it's a really good game but you're just being held back by the horrible horrible

02:51:58.140 --> 02:52:06.460
controls like I select my units and always picking the wrong ones and it's

02:52:06.460 --> 02:52:10.340
just not working I could see that because that's a lot of games in game

02:52:10.340 --> 02:52:15.260
room are kind of like that a lot of Street Fighter 4 on the Xbox 360 kind of

02:52:15.260 --> 02:52:19.980
made me think that because it was just so awful to try and control but it's

02:52:19.980 --> 02:52:24.820
kind of a bummer that that controller really ruins some games and what pisses

02:52:24.820 --> 02:52:28.300
me off is because I didn't know that they're gonna have a PlayStation move

02:52:28.300 --> 02:52:32.220
and that would probably work a lot better than trying to you know it's

02:52:32.220 --> 02:52:37.100
basically like having a big anchor and being thrown off the side of the boat

02:52:37.100 --> 02:52:41.860
you're kind of being dragged down to the bottom the ocean there well now what do

02:52:41.860 --> 02:52:44.180
you think though about this new Xbox 360 controller they're supposed to be

02:52:44.180 --> 02:52:47.380
putting out that has the whole like yeah you just twist it and then it's like a

02:52:47.380 --> 02:52:53.020
different d-pad it looks like a big gimmick to charge me $65 isn't that

02:52:53.020 --> 02:52:56.220
terrible that they're only bound bundling it with that dumb play in

02:52:56.220 --> 02:53:00.860
charge or whatever it is like oh it's so annoying how they do this just like it's

02:53:00.860 --> 02:53:06.000
just like Nintendo doing that new Nintendo remote with Wii Plus or

02:53:06.000 --> 02:53:11.500
whatever with a crappy tennis knockoff game I mean really that's yeah but at

02:53:11.500 --> 02:53:17.500
least the Wii Sports Resort was at least you know fun that's true I don't know I

02:53:17.500 --> 02:53:20.060
didn't play a lot of that very seriously because I kind of gave up on the way I

02:53:20.060 --> 02:53:23.540
haven't had my Wii plugged in and like over a year which is really sad because

02:53:23.540 --> 02:53:27.180
I wanted to play Metroid but I just I can't bring myself to hook up the new

02:53:27.180 --> 02:53:33.620
Nintendo Wii. God dammit you're lazy. Somewhere deep in Nintendo America's headquarters, Reggie is amazed crying himself to sleep after that.

02:53:33.620 --> 02:53:37.420
but the problem is like I have heard nothing but bad things about the new

02:53:37.420 --> 02:53:40.100
Metroid and it's making me a little weird well I've heard a few good things

02:53:40.100 --> 02:53:43.660
here and there but I'm a little scared because like Super Metroid is like the

02:53:43.660 --> 02:53:48.460
Holy Grail of video games to me and oh yeah I love Super Metroid and if they

02:53:48.460 --> 02:53:54.100
botched it like I'm I'm really really sad like my experience with new Metroid

02:53:54.100 --> 02:54:00.040
was about five minutes at Best Buy and it seemed okay but I have five minutes I

02:54:00.040 --> 02:54:05.180
can't really say here or there could be good just wouldn't kind of made me

02:54:05.180 --> 02:54:09.420
honest yeah you can't base an entire review of a game off of just five

02:54:09.420 --> 02:54:13.460
minutes you know cuz I'm sure everybody at E3 loved it you know the lines to play

02:54:13.460 --> 02:54:18.140
that game at E3 were like hours long it was almost as long as the 3ds line at

02:54:18.140 --> 02:54:21.460
some points because it was moving a little slower really it's not like I

02:54:21.460 --> 02:54:24.820
guess the people who couldn't get into the 3ds line said okay I'll sell from

02:54:24.820 --> 02:54:29.900
Metroid yes yes maybe not hours but like at least an hour it's crazy how long

02:54:29.900 --> 02:54:32.980
lines get there that reminds me I'm getting my wallet ready this week to

02:54:32.980 --> 02:54:38.940
find out how much they'll be raping me out of my wallet for the 3ds oh is that

02:54:38.940 --> 02:54:43.420
are they announcing a date this week well I'm hearing there and finally

02:54:43.420 --> 02:54:46.500
announced it like in the middle of this week I think was Wednesday that's right

02:54:46.500 --> 02:54:50.460
because Nintendo doesn't do Tokyo game show right but they always do their own

02:54:50.460 --> 02:54:55.460
little kind of like spin-off right they do their own little fan event around the

02:54:55.460 --> 02:54:59.460
same time so that makes sense so I'm kind of like basically unless they're

02:54:59.460 --> 02:55:02.300
like charging a thousand bucks they basically got me locked down for that

02:55:02.300 --> 02:55:09.100
thing I gonna say it's probably gonna be 249 and it's gonna come with a like

02:55:09.100 --> 02:55:13.020
either I think it'll be like kind of like a tech demo II type of game that's

02:55:13.020 --> 02:55:15.660
just a bunch of like the movie trailers and some of the tech demos they were

02:55:15.660 --> 02:55:22.060
showing it on 3ds and then like ocarina of time in 3d or some old-ass Nintendo

02:55:22.060 --> 02:55:26.420
IP that they can just easily do as the pack in the game well they got me at

02:55:26.420 --> 02:55:30.620
launch for DS and I bought the PSP within three months of launch so I'm

02:55:30.620 --> 02:55:33.140
pretty sure I'm gonna pick this up do you regret buying either of those

02:55:33.140 --> 02:55:40.680
systems maybe the PSP a little bit you know the DS I had been having like as a

02:55:40.680 --> 02:55:44.420
paperweight for the last six months there really hasn't been anything coming

02:55:44.420 --> 02:55:48.540
out this year for it no yeah they didn't really show a lot of d3 either because

02:55:48.540 --> 02:55:51.620
there it's all about the 3ds now you know and except for the little girl

02:55:51.620 --> 02:55:54.620
games like fancy Nancy yeah that's like the only thing that seems interesting

02:55:54.620 --> 02:55:58.420
coming out is maybe Pokemon in black and white well that's true that's gonna be a

02:55:58.420 --> 02:56:05.860
big deal when it comes out well otherwise I just don't see my fancy all

02:56:05.860 --> 02:56:09.140
right well zappy any other thoughts for the listeners before I let you go

02:56:09.140 --> 02:56:15.660
tonight um don't buy ruse on the 360 the PC is probably the best choice and maybe

02:56:15.660 --> 02:56:20.660
the PlayStation move version all right word of warning of caution to the

02:56:20.660 --> 02:56:24.260

02:57:14.620 --> 02:57:18.140
know if this is mentioned before because I've been paying a lot of attention

02:57:18.140 --> 02:57:22.340
plants versus zombies is now becoming a quest in World of Warcraft

02:57:22.340 --> 02:57:27.140

iPhone iPad or iPod Android device app and you probably have to pay the

02:58:11.140 --> 02:58:17.340
premium that you have to pay it is a $2.99 monthly subscription fee yeah yeah

02:58:17.340 --> 02:58:24.140
