00:00.000 --> 00:12.000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio. We are live on September the 5th of 2010,

00:12.000 --> 00:17.200
a Sunday here with our Orange Lounge Radio Marathon. We are almost, what, about 7 hours

00:17.200 --> 00:18.200
in at this point now.

00:18.200 --> 00:19.760
Dan, check on the pizza.

00:19.760 --> 00:25.080
We started at about 2.05 and it's now 8.50 on the west coast here where we tape. You

00:25.080 --> 00:28.680
can listen live, of course, to All Games Radio, www.allgames.com. I imagine that's what most

00:28.680 --> 00:32.080
of you are doing because the podcast, you'd have to be way, way, way into that now to

00:32.080 --> 00:37.080
get to this point. So, anyhow, we were going to do some news here and I was going to open

00:37.080 --> 00:40.720
the Skype line again here in just a moment, so we'll have that again open if you want

00:40.720 --> 00:45.880
to give us a call at 1-877-GAME-OLR. Not just yet, I'm going to open it here in a moment.

00:45.880 --> 00:48.920
But we had another question, I guess, come in on Ask Orange Lounge or something. It slipped

00:48.920 --> 00:53.600
through the cracks and I thought it was a pretty good question, so I apologize to bother

00:53.600 --> 00:57.040
Alan mid-chew there, but do you remember what that question was all about? The extra question

00:57.040 --> 00:58.040
we got?

00:58.040 --> 01:02.240
Which game or system did you pass up on when it came out that you never bought that you

01:02.240 --> 01:03.240
now regret?

01:03.240 --> 01:07.520
Or, I thought there was also a question about what system do you regret buying to?

01:07.520 --> 01:14.640
Okay, well, let's do both. What system do you regret buying and what thing do you wish

01:14.640 --> 01:23.320
you hadn't passed up, I guess that would be? I think for me, the thing that I most regret

01:23.320 --> 01:27.880
passing up probably was the Sega Dreamcast the first time it was out. I ended up buying

01:27.880 --> 01:32.980
one eventually, but I didn't buy one when it first came out in 99 because that was kind

01:32.980 --> 01:37.200
of the period where I was still trying to wrap up all my college stuff and my life was

01:37.200 --> 01:40.800
in this total discourse for a while. So I didn't buy one when it first came out, which

01:40.800 --> 01:45.480
is a pity because it was kind of an awesome system. So that would probably be my answer,

01:45.480 --> 01:48.280
the Sega Dreamcast. I did get one when they were like 40 bucks. Remember when they cut

01:48.280 --> 01:51.840
the price down to like 40 bucks? Or at least GameStop was just trying to unload them or

01:51.840 --> 01:55.920
something because at that point you could do all the NES emulators on the Dreamcast

01:55.920 --> 01:59.920
and all that stuff. It was really cool. So that's when I finally got on the Dreamcast

01:59.920 --> 02:05.040
bandwagon, but it was a little bit too late. And keep in mind guys, the Skype line is not

02:05.040 --> 02:08.480
open yet. So if you're calling in, hold off, we'll get to the calls a little later here

02:08.480 --> 02:19.360
in the program. Alan? I actually was able to buy an original edition of Panzer Dragoon

02:19.360 --> 02:27.160
Saga for the Saturn, which came out well after the Saturn was dead. I bought it, took the

02:27.160 --> 02:33.920
bus after school to go to the mall, dropped the 70 or 80 bucks for it. I ended up selling

02:33.920 --> 02:42.960
it for a killing on eBay. Like two years later, I never touched it. So I bought it, never

02:42.960 --> 02:48.080
played it. And Panzer Dragoon Saga is one of the greatest RPGs, especially for the Saturn.

02:48.080 --> 02:52.760
And I sold it on eBay for like 200 something bucks and I needed the money. But it's like,

02:52.760 --> 02:57.080
why did I do that? Like I had, I just walked into the store and bought it and I never touched

02:57.080 --> 03:04.580
it. You could play ours if you want. The N64 I got for Ocarina of Time because I was very,

03:04.580 --> 03:10.000
you know, at that age I was very elitist and snobby about CD-ROM versus card and how Nintendo

03:10.000 --> 03:17.160
was making the wrong decision. And I bought an N64 just for Ocarina of Time and I never

03:17.160 --> 03:23.040
really played any other game. I bought a bunch of games for the N64 and never touched them.

03:23.040 --> 03:28.800
So that was probably a waste of money. So those would be the, wait, now you're talking

03:28.800 --> 03:33.520
the games you regret buying, right? Yeah those are my two for that. Do you have any for the

03:33.520 --> 03:41.140
one that I had answered about the system or game you regret not buying? I really wish

03:41.140 --> 03:46.720
I could have checked out the TurboGrafx, but that was a bit out of my league at the time.

03:46.720 --> 03:50.000
My friend had one and at the time I thought it was kind of stupid. I gotta be honest like

03:50.000 --> 03:54.360
the games I played on it were not that great. Like we played Splatterhouse which was kind

03:54.360 --> 03:57.880
of cool. Like in the fact that you know it was Splatterhouse it was kind of like a horror

03:57.880 --> 04:02.960
movie type game but otherwise I didn't find the games on it to be that great. And to this

04:02.960 --> 04:07.200
day I got to admit I know Dark Soccer's got a lot of love for it. Maybe it's because she's

04:07.200 --> 04:10.360
out of the room. I'll dare to say this. I still kind of think the whole thing was kind

04:10.360 --> 04:14.040
of overrated. Like it wasn't that great of a system I don't think. Well it was the only

04:14.040 --> 04:19.240
system that got the original Street Fighter and it also got you know Castlevania X the

04:19.240 --> 04:24.740
lost Castlevania game until recently. And that's cool but you know how many of us actually

04:24.740 --> 04:29.280
played that? I mean sure Jamie did but she's you know cray cray. Yeah in a good way. Aside

04:29.280 --> 04:33.280
from that all the systems that were even a little bit relevant I had at one point I did

04:33.280 --> 04:38.560
get a Genesis. I got it years after everyone else but I got it before the PlayStation one

04:38.560 --> 04:47.280
came out. The 32X and the Sega CD were all considered failures so you know don't really

04:47.280 --> 04:52.400
have much regrets there. I have the original Lunar on a ROM I can play it on my computer

04:52.400 --> 05:00.600
so. For me the system that I regret buying like not don't regret not buying but the game

05:00.600 --> 05:07.320
the system I regret buying that I kind of wish I hadn't was a second DS. I had a DS

05:07.320 --> 05:10.760
fat and then the original DS and then I bought a DS lite and I don't think I really needed

05:10.760 --> 05:14.720
that lite. You don't handheld game at all. I really don't. Unless you're on a plane.

05:14.720 --> 05:18.320
Yeah so I honestly think the DS fat would have been good enough for me and I should

05:18.320 --> 05:21.400
have never bought the lite and I bought the lite in a moment of weakness I bought it when

05:21.400 --> 05:26.800
I was traveling and literally had like nothing else to do so I went to a local game stop

05:26.800 --> 05:31.040
in the town and bought the lite and I kind of wish I hadn't. What about the PSP fat?

05:31.040 --> 05:34.880
I'm sure you have one of those right? I did and I ended up getting a PSP 3000 as well

05:34.880 --> 05:39.080
but you know what I actually would play the PSP probably more than I did the DS. Just

05:39.080 --> 05:42.720
the certain games that were on it with luminous and the final fantasy remakes and so forth.

05:42.720 --> 05:48.840
I mean don't get me wrong the DS had its games too but I don't know also the PSP one I kind

05:48.840 --> 05:54.320
of wore it down and it didn't work as well anymore so it kind of justified for me the

05:54.320 --> 05:59.920
PSP 3000 even though that's probably not like the greatest reason to have one if that makes

05:59.920 --> 06:05.880
sense but yeah. I know the idea of buying a movie on UMD is kind of ridiculous but if

06:05.880 --> 06:12.220
you can get you know Kill Bill on UMD it fries for like five bucks that's got a better strain

06:12.220 --> 06:17.560
on it than your iPhone does really. Oh yeah. To watch a movie on that. Good stuff. Dar

06:17.560 --> 06:24.280
Sacra we're talking about the system or console you regret most buying and then the one you

06:24.280 --> 06:31.680
regret not buying. I don't really have anything that I regret buying I guess if I was going

06:31.680 --> 06:36.800
to pick one it would be the game com because it was awful. I don't even regret the end

06:36.800 --> 06:46.720
gauge because I had some good stuff on there but as far as things I regret not buying.

06:46.720 --> 06:50.200
You know what's funny Robert M. in chat gave the same answer almost at the same time the

06:50.200 --> 07:00.800
game com this is where you're at. I'm because I haven't really passed up anything. I think

07:00.800 --> 07:07.200
maybe no I have Proteus salamander deluxe pack because Dan's been wanting it lately.

07:07.200 --> 07:14.000
Oh on the PSP? No the Saturn. Oh because they have they have a gratius collection on PSP

07:14.000 --> 07:20.040
I think they did a salamander one. I've regretted never buying a duo RX because we could

07:20.040 --> 07:27.960
certainly use one. Bradley? Okay let's see what I regret and probably not buying was

07:27.960 --> 07:33.400
I never got a Dreamcast. I hear all the great stories about it and I just never got around

07:33.400 --> 07:39.160
to it. I don't know I don't think this might have been the time. I did have a job at the

07:39.160 --> 07:43.160
time so I didn't really have couldn't get it. The system was truly ahead of its time

07:43.160 --> 07:47.920
if it had come out like two years later with DVD support I think I honestly think it would

07:47.920 --> 07:53.320
have whipped the PlayStation 2. I really truly think that. I know I'm crazy but I do. Yeah

07:53.320 --> 07:58.680
I don't think there's any systems that I regret buying because I think I like all my systems

07:58.680 --> 08:05.360
that I have. His story about Prince of Dragoon makes me reminds me I actually had to sell

08:05.360 --> 08:10.040
mine off because I was I had like no money at the time and really regret doing that and

08:10.040 --> 08:15.880
really didn't want to buy it back. I actually did win an auction for it on eBay for like

08:15.880 --> 08:20.600
200 something bucks but the guy never shipped it which was really annoying. He kept saying

08:20.600 --> 08:24.200
he wasn't going to ship it but he didn't and it gave him like a fake code or something

08:24.200 --> 08:28.320
but since I did it through PayPal I was able to get the money back at least for that so

08:28.320 --> 08:35.440
I can see if I can find it again sometime. The game I regret of buying was the sequel

08:35.440 --> 08:39.560
to Alex Kidd in Miracle World. I can't remember what it was called. Alex Kidd 2 something

08:39.560 --> 08:44.640
is just because Alex Kidd in Miracle World is a great game. It takes a while to get through

08:44.640 --> 08:50.200
it and it takes a while to figure it out because I played it again like a few years ago and

08:50.200 --> 08:54.560
I couldn't get through it because there's like some spikes and stuff in the last few

08:54.560 --> 09:00.320
levels that can be kind of hard to get past. But the second game is like it's a really

09:00.320 --> 09:09.760
easy instead of having like the map like the first one has and the first one is not exactly

09:09.760 --> 09:16.000
it's not linear or it's not left to right it's left to right and up and down depending

09:16.000 --> 09:20.320
on the level but in the second game you only go left to right and it's actually a really

09:20.320 --> 09:28.640
easy game. I beat it the first day and it's like really disappointing just because of

09:28.640 --> 09:36.640
how great the first game was. Alright good answers guys. I think we're going to do some

09:36.640 --> 09:40.600
quick news stories. We had a couple left over that we never got around to and then we actually

09:40.600 --> 09:44.560
have some other discussion topics. So Dark Soccer I don't know if you have the piece

09:44.560 --> 09:49.360
on the last one that we had left over that we didn't get to before dinner. I do. About

09:49.360 --> 09:56.500
Telltale. Basically Telltale is doing a five episode Back to the Future series and it's

09:56.500 --> 10:01.440
going to have Marty McFly and Doc Brown. It has Christopher Lloyd voicing Doc Brown which

10:01.440 --> 10:11.240
is great and Hill Valley being 1985 and guidance from the screenwriter Bob Gale and the DeLorean.

10:11.240 --> 10:18.040
So they're still working on getting the rest of it up but they're still a bit missing you

10:18.040 --> 10:24.760
know. I guess what? Hoverboards and Huey Lewis in the news. I'm looking forward to seeing

10:24.760 --> 10:28.600
like what the actual game looks like. You know we've heard a lot of talk about the game

10:28.600 --> 10:32.400
and kind of like ramping up to it. I'm kind of excited to see what the damn thing actually

10:32.400 --> 10:35.800
looks like but I'm sure it'll be fine. I have some trivia for you. You can kind of guess

10:35.800 --> 10:39.920
because can I tell you a secret? Like a lot of people are going to judge me for this but

10:39.920 --> 10:45.280
I don't really care. I have never seen Back to the Future one or two. We can fix that.

10:45.280 --> 10:49.520
But I have seen part three isn't that weird? The Wild West one. I saw one and then I saw

10:49.520 --> 10:55.380
three I didn't see two for the longest time. I never saw one or two. But Rob. What? Here's

10:55.380 --> 10:59.280
some trivia for you. On the Back to the Future pinball table you know that Michael J. Fox

10:59.280 --> 11:03.840
would not allow his likeness to be used so they made a generic looking dude. I think

11:03.840 --> 11:07.320
I know that because you've brought it up on the show before. Actually true story. True

11:07.320 --> 11:15.440
story. Alright. One other story for you guys and it has to do with the Connect Beta is

11:15.440 --> 11:20.880
going on right now of course. They're starting to ship out and all that good stuff. Someone

11:20.880 --> 11:27.320
is trying to sell theirs on eBay. They're trying to get twelve hundred dollars for it.

11:27.320 --> 11:33.000
But it was quickly taken offline. I'm assuming Microsoft sent a cease and desist to the kind

11:33.000 --> 11:38.200
of folks at eBay. So probably Microsoft did not take kindly to the fact that the unit

11:38.200 --> 11:44.280
was being sold. The seller on eBay was Blue Room Project and there were no bids actually

11:44.280 --> 11:50.740
made on the system. So there it was. What's interesting about it though is that I would

11:50.740 --> 11:55.100
think that this and the article kind of gets into this too is that you would think these

11:55.100 --> 11:59.160
connects are going to be sending back quite a bit of data to Microsoft servers so it could

11:59.160 --> 12:04.440
kind of figure out who's playing connect that shouldn't be. Right? Like if you get a connect

12:04.440 --> 12:07.800
early aren't you kind of setting yourself up for trouble unless you never sign on to

12:07.800 --> 12:11.840
Xbox Live which I guess you could do but then how would you get the patches and all that

12:11.840 --> 12:16.360
stuff. It just seems tricky tricky. I wish Loki was here to explain a little more about

12:16.360 --> 12:19.640
how you could get around that but I'm just thinking you know what probably not a good

12:19.640 --> 12:24.840
idea to just buy these that you don't really have the rights because Microsoft can track

12:24.840 --> 12:27.920
what goes online and you're going to have to go online to get some of the patches and

12:27.920 --> 12:34.600
updates so it just doesn't make sense. That was it for the news. That was all the news

12:34.600 --> 12:39.900
we had set to cover this show. So if you have more stories you want to talk about we're

12:39.900 --> 12:44.400
actually going to open up the Skype line. Now it is open folks. 1-877-GAME-OLR our username

12:44.400 --> 12:47.760
on Skype is OrangeLawnTradio. We're going to take some more calls. So you can either

12:47.760 --> 12:52.200
call us and talk to us about a news story or really anything you've heard about tonight

12:52.200 --> 13:01.480
or you can send us a tweet at twitter.com slash o-l-r. You can send us a tweet and we'll

13:01.480 --> 13:05.560
read those again in a little bit if we're getting some tweets at twitter.com slash o-l-r

13:05.560 --> 13:08.840
and I think Dark Soccer had mentioned something about wanting to do the mailbag again but

13:08.840 --> 13:13.480
I don't know if any letters have dropped in. We're kind of monitoring all those pretty

13:13.480 --> 13:19.480
closely right now. I'm actually going to kind of load up the tweets. Let's see how those

13:19.480 --> 13:23.960
are going. Alright we are getting some calls. Let's go to the phones. Hi you're on OrangeLawnTradio

13:23.960 --> 13:29.400
who's this? Hey this is XLink. Hey XLink welcome to hour 7 of the marathon. How ya doing? Doing

13:29.400 --> 13:35.760
good and you? I'm still awake that's a good thing. What's on your mind? Nothing much.

13:35.760 --> 13:40.800
I'm really excited to hear that they are going to do a mini series based on Back to the Future

13:40.800 --> 13:46.080
which is hopefully going to be epic now they're getting actual actors to do the voices from

13:46.080 --> 13:51.040
the movie and stuff so that's going to be cool. I would love to see Michael J. Fox come

13:51.040 --> 13:57.720
on also because that would be excellent. Also Telltale also got excited for it because they

13:57.720 --> 14:01.980
announced a new poker game coming out this fall with different characters from different

14:01.980 --> 14:10.680
game series. Poker Night at the Inventory with Tycho from Penny Arcade, the Strong Bad from

14:10.680 --> 14:19.460
Home Star Runner, Max from Sam & Max and then the Heavy from Team Fortress 2. So that should

14:19.460 --> 14:24.160
be pretty interesting of a poker game when they get that all said and done. Yeah to be

14:24.160 --> 14:28.960
fair it was brought up about 6 hours ago but yeah we did talk about it a little bit but

14:28.960 --> 14:34.960
it sounds kind of interesting. I'm not usually somebody that gets super into the poker games

14:34.960 --> 14:39.920
but I kind of like where this one's going. It's an interesting hodgepodge of characters.

14:39.920 --> 14:44.400
What do you kind of hope you get out of this poker game? Just the wackiness because of

14:44.400 --> 14:47.020
Telltale and the way they're going to put this together there's going to be some kind

14:47.020 --> 14:51.280
of epic fighting going on between characters and stuff which is going to be absolutely

14:51.280 --> 15:01.280
great to see. That's the over-slapstick humor that they usually do with some of their games.

15:01.280 --> 15:07.000
So what else is on your mind? Anything? No I've been playing a lot of WoW as of course

15:07.000 --> 15:11.560
you should know. Of course because I play a lot of WoW too. Fancy that. Yeah we all

15:11.560 --> 15:18.960
do. What are some of your WoW accomplishments recently? Almost had the TOC 25 which I would

15:18.960 --> 15:25.800
have been very proud of. Just a lot of different odds and ends. ICC getting farther than that

15:25.800 --> 15:33.560
now in the 10 man so with the guild. Hopefully I'm really going to be proud because I'm going

15:33.560 --> 15:37.880
to try to go for some of the other odds and ends like the fishing mounts and stuff like

15:37.880 --> 15:45.840
that. Awesome. Yeah so. Alright well anything else on your mind buddy before we let you

15:45.840 --> 15:49.640
go and take more calls? Nope that's pretty much about it. Well you have a good night

15:49.640 --> 15:57.560
good luck with WoW. Thank you you too. Alright bye. Alright 1-877-GAME-OLR our username on

15:57.560 --> 16:08.280
Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio you can give us a call. Alright. I was just ringing off the

16:08.280 --> 16:11.380
hook a minute ago so I'm hoping more calls will come in. We are getting some tweets thank

16:11.380 --> 16:18.800
you guys. Twitter.com slash OLR we'll get to those in just a moment. How you doing over

16:18.800 --> 16:27.360
there DuckSock are you good? Yeah I'm a little woozy. From the drinking? Yeah I'm starting

16:27.360 --> 16:30.920
to get a little like heyyyy. Brandy hits me really fast. I don't care. Alright hey you're

16:30.920 --> 16:36.280
on OrangeLoungeRadio who's this? Hi this is Spazzinator. Hey Spazzinator welcome to the

16:36.280 --> 16:42.760
marathon what's on your mind? Yeah well this is probably a question that's probably better

16:42.760 --> 16:51.960
answered by Loki but since he took off a few hours ago I'll ask you guys. I'm kind of sort

16:51.960 --> 17:00.320
of toying around with the idea of more or less recreating our K-Camp that I once saw

17:00.320 --> 17:09.360
going years back. I don't know if you've ever seen this one particular model. It had a samurai

17:09.360 --> 17:20.240
showdown 4 in it and basically the configuration was and it came in two pieces. The one section

17:20.240 --> 17:29.560
had the joysticks and the buns and the coin slots and all that and maybe the second piece

17:29.560 --> 17:37.000
was basically the monitoring. There was like 5 or 10 feet away and there was like a chain

17:37.000 --> 17:42.520
flicking the two together. Wait wait wait you gotta back up here. This was a special

17:42.520 --> 17:50.840
machine or a custom machine you're saying? Yeah I think more or less recreating at least

17:50.840 --> 18:04.920
part of the custom machine for myself or at least the part with the controls on it. You

18:04.920 --> 18:12.360
know aside from the part with the controls like the joystick and all that I was wondering

18:12.360 --> 18:19.640
what kind of materials do you think I should be using to build the cabin itself like should

18:19.640 --> 18:24.400
I use like particle boards and laminate or? Yeah this is definitely a low key question

18:24.400 --> 18:28.040
because I don't know anything about this stuff but I will tell you one like somewhat cheap

18:28.040 --> 18:32.120
alternative that I've heard being used before is like actually trying to find old arcade

18:32.120 --> 18:36.280
cabinets that for whatever reason the games inside them don't work anymore because the

18:36.280 --> 18:40.440
cabinets seem to make pretty good shells for these custom cabinets for whatever it is you're

18:40.440 --> 18:45.440
trying to build. A samurai showdown 4 case or whatever it is. Those are usually a really

18:45.440 --> 18:51.280
good place to start at least from what I've heard and I think that's what quite a few

18:51.280 --> 18:57.800
people have done. Like don't you guys have like a custom cabinet in some time? We just

18:57.800 --> 19:04.480
modified a pole position back in the day and used it and put a damp built the layout and

19:04.480 --> 19:10.600
everything with the buttons and joysticks. Yeah. Otherwise as far as like specific materials

19:10.600 --> 19:15.040
that work best not really my realm of expertise because I've never built a cabinet so I'm

19:15.040 --> 19:19.240
not going to profess to know that stuff but I'm sure there are some websites or yeah Loki

19:19.240 --> 19:24.520
is a good resource you know when he's here when he's not babysitting. Yeah ultimately

19:24.520 --> 19:33.960
my goal is to you know like let's say get you know to use this is just an example I'm

19:33.960 --> 19:44.160
thinking of gaining one of those $150 arcade sticks for the PNC or 360 drop drop that into

19:44.160 --> 19:52.880
the cabinet run but arcade sticks wires to my gain system and then in turn have my gain

19:52.880 --> 19:59.320
system go to my high def TV and more or less kind of sort of have a arcade cabinet but

19:59.320 --> 20:05.520
not quite. Well I know that Loki was also going to be working on a project about building

20:05.520 --> 20:10.200
arcade cabinets for like a hundred bucks so you know I'm all about building on a budget

20:10.200 --> 20:17.920
that's for sure. Alright well thanks for taking my call. Alright. Alright have a good one.

20:17.920 --> 20:23.440
You too buddy have a good night. You too. Alright. 1877 game OLR or our username on

20:23.440 --> 20:29.320
Skype is orange lounge radio. Yeah we're taking more calls I've been seeing quite a few it's

20:29.320 --> 20:33.320
like they'll all come in all at once. I think you can tell when like the 30 seconds catches

20:33.320 --> 20:37.180
up to everybody because you know there's time from the time we say something to encode to

20:37.180 --> 20:41.360
send all games to broadcast to you so like I think after that 30 seconds is up like the

20:41.360 --> 20:45.480
phone just lights up it's kind of awesome. Take a few more calls here and then maybe

20:45.480 --> 20:49.480
go back to the Twitter. Did we check the email bag? Do we have any new emails to go to? I

20:49.480 --> 20:57.100
think they were junk mail. Stupid spammers. Spammers need to go kill themselves. Not really

20:57.100 --> 21:03.240
though but yes. Alright more calls. Hi you're on orange lounge radio the marathon who's

21:03.240 --> 21:09.760
this? Legend of Zaku from your cell phone. Hey Legend of Zaku from your cell phone. Welcome

21:09.760 --> 21:15.960
to hour 7 of the marathon what's up? Oh wow you guys are really pushing it this time aren't

21:15.960 --> 21:23.080
you? Yeah a little bit. We haven't done a show this long since DDR tournaments that's

21:23.080 --> 21:29.580
for sure. Right so yeah apparently the the biggest thing right now is Duke Nukem Forever

21:29.580 --> 21:34.920
basically coming back from the dead in a more spectacular way. I never thought it would

21:34.920 --> 21:38.880
actually happen. Oh yes what do you think about all this news that has come out of Penny

21:38.880 --> 21:45.040
Arcade Expo? All I know is that it you know it better they better just stick to the schedule

21:45.040 --> 21:52.160
get it out because the last thing we need is for other folks to just you know have this

21:52.160 --> 21:58.840
game be the butt of everyone's joke again. At the same time though at this point Zaku

21:58.840 --> 22:03.960
what's another year? Like you know if they if they delay it to 2012 what's another year

22:03.960 --> 22:09.960
at this point? But but the game is so close I mean people are already playing a demo of

22:09.960 --> 22:17.440
it and what I hear is like at polishing stages. No I get it it's just like. I agree if they're

22:17.440 --> 22:22.560
showing it on the floor at Penny Arcade Expo it's darn close to done and they're they're

22:22.560 --> 22:28.000
really I mean showing it at Penny Arcade Expo keep in mind they bypassed E3 to make this

22:28.000 --> 22:32.700
announcement they if this has been in development since 2009 they could have announced this

22:32.700 --> 22:38.040
at E3 but they didn't they went and took it directly to people like you and me at Penny

22:38.040 --> 22:43.360
Arcade Expo that's like unzipping it and whipping it out on the table for everybody to admire

22:43.360 --> 22:50.880
that's what. Then again this game actually appeals to the hardcore demographic not necessarily

22:50.880 --> 22:56.760
something you would want you know average Joe gamer who pretty much doesn't have a clue

22:56.760 --> 23:02.480
as to what Duke Nukem is unless they have been playing during the you know mid to late

23:02.480 --> 23:10.040
90s. Well I mean they've tried to drop these little inklings of Duke Nukem to put it back

23:10.040 --> 23:15.400
in our consciousness in the past couple years like the Duke Nukem release on Xbox Live and

23:15.400 --> 23:20.600
I think there's another like isn't there a 2D Duke Nukem game set to come out? Pretty

23:20.600 --> 23:28.000
much I mean the whole point is that I guess I kind of find it surprising that the first

23:28.000 --> 23:34.200
you know you know the studio behind Borderlands and the guys found it it pretty much has connection

23:34.200 --> 23:41.440
to 3D Realms and the you know and the folks who ran it up until its demise. I never thought

23:41.440 --> 23:46.240
is you know that guy's career is pretty much owed to Duke Nukem. Well now I'm wondering

23:46.240 --> 23:50.400
though if um you know they knew that they had this game that Gearbox has had this game

23:50.400 --> 23:55.040
since like 2009 like when did Duke Nukem come out? Didn't it come out about a year ago?

23:55.040 --> 24:00.560
I guess I guess it would be about I'm wondering if they didn't push out that Duke Nukem Live

24:00.560 --> 24:04.360
around the time that they knew that Gearbox would be taking this game on to kind of help

24:04.360 --> 24:07.960
push Duke Nukem back to the front of everybody's minds like that's kind of one thing I'm thinking

24:07.960 --> 24:12.560
now in retrospect. Wondering how the timing of everything worked out. All I know is that

24:12.560 --> 24:18.120
basically from what I read in the article like a Taco article when they interviewed

24:18.120 --> 24:24.380
you know that guy basically after 3D Realms shut down most of it was pretty much a two

24:24.380 --> 24:30.280
bit operation running from people's apartments. Pretty much a garage game up until a point

24:30.280 --> 24:35.760
where Gearbox took control of it. So it was pretty much it was pretty much coming together

24:35.760 --> 24:41.840
piecemeal so there's no way you would mount something unless you have a solid backing

24:41.840 --> 24:46.800
from one of the developers able to actually finish the job instead of putting it through

24:46.800 --> 24:53.560
development hell. 15 years is like pretty much pushing it for any product. You know

24:53.560 --> 25:00.840
even Starcraft 2 but then again Blizzard took their time and they got it out the door. But

25:00.840 --> 25:06.560
3D Realms pretty much you know that's what cost them you know that's what took the studio

25:06.560 --> 25:13.080
down with them. The fact they couldn't deliver. Well I mean you know again it's been shown

25:13.080 --> 25:19.120
now it's something that is actually going to come out so we'll you know see what happens.

25:19.120 --> 25:26.280
Right and hopefully everything everything will make sense and at least I can hear more

25:26.280 --> 25:32.720
like one liners out of this guy. That's pretty much what OLR needs a lot more Duke Nukem

25:32.720 --> 25:39.400
one liners out of nowhere. I don't know the soundboard is kind of saved for special occasions

25:39.400 --> 25:43.560
we'll see. And real quick a comment from our chat room Derek H is asking is the caller

25:43.560 --> 25:50.640
saying that 3D Realms was a garage development house? No I'm just saying that after 3D Realms

25:50.640 --> 25:58.960
blew up because of Duke Nukem Forever's development the folks from 3D Realms in the transition

25:58.960 --> 26:04.560
the gearbox you know in between that time started working you know worked on Duke Nukem

26:04.560 --> 26:11.880
Forever from their apartment. So some of it during that time with 3D Realms the demise

26:11.880 --> 26:17.080
still got handed over the gearbox was pretty much a two-bit operation. I know 3D Realms

26:17.080 --> 26:22.480
pretty much a you know big-name studio back in the day. Hell they really they turned out

26:22.480 --> 26:33.640
a lot of PC types and now I'm pretty much fond of. All right. So I hope you know. Well

26:33.640 --> 26:37.080
I think it's going to be great. The only thing that's going to be sad is that since it's

26:37.080 --> 26:40.960
not you know just like Borderlands you're not going to get quests in Duke Nukem as far

26:40.960 --> 26:45.160
as I know so it won't be like you know hey you need to go up to the stripper and tipper

26:45.160 --> 26:50.320
although I guess you do have to press R to pee in the toilet. No the whole point of Duke

26:50.320 --> 26:57.520
Nukem is just pick up and play you know kill people max out on your on your try to like

26:57.520 --> 27:02.440
get all the power ups and weapons and just go all out. That's the whole point is it you're

27:02.440 --> 27:07.720
just killing you're just shooting people like do but instead you're just like you know you're

27:07.720 --> 27:13.280
killing a lot more aliens and monsters. All right. And with the bottom one-liners. All

27:13.280 --> 27:16.360
right well Zaku we got to let you go to get some more calls but I hope you can get your

27:16.360 --> 27:22.000
hands on Duke Nukem soon and see see it's the real thing. All right. Later. Have a good

27:22.000 --> 27:26.080
one. 877 game OLR username on Skype is Orange Launch Radio we have another call coming in.

27:26.080 --> 27:31.760
Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio who's this? Hey this is DJ Blaziken. Hey DJ Blaziken what's

27:31.760 --> 27:37.320
on your mind? Oh not much other than I've been listening to this whole marathon shindig

27:37.320 --> 27:43.600
since it started up and the whole music break thing is bringing me back to the old days

27:43.600 --> 27:49.640
back from the really old episodes I started listening to you guys back on your old station.

27:49.640 --> 27:54.080
Well I'm glad to hear I'm glad to hear it that's kind of the idea behind it now for

27:54.080 --> 27:57.600
those that are listening on the podcast we can't do the copyrighted music that we were

27:57.600 --> 28:01.320
playing during our little breaks here for meals and potty and all that stuff but yeah

28:01.320 --> 28:03.840
we're playing a lot of the music you know when Orange Launch Radio back when we were

28:03.840 --> 28:10.080
a station on live 365 we would play music from DDR and like of just a variety of the

28:10.080 --> 28:15.360
other music based games and some of the dance mania CDs that inspired the music song list

28:15.360 --> 28:23.120
in DDR and so forth. Yeah so of all things okay I've been a little bit on a dirty shore

28:23.120 --> 28:29.840
fanatic so I've been fist pumping throughout the whole breaks. Wow. I don't think I've

28:29.840 --> 28:35.760
ever heard anyone say that about this program there's a first for everything. Hey by the

28:35.760 --> 28:44.440
way um actually just um thinking of systems that regret not buying systems that do regret

28:44.440 --> 28:58.840
buying um somehow I regret not buying a Sega Dreamcast myself because and actually you

28:58.840 --> 29:03.160
know what I also had a second system I regret not buying because I had to kick ass fighting

29:03.160 --> 29:12.800
game on it was um the N64 which it had killer instinct and the controller itself the standard

29:12.800 --> 29:17.080
controller was perfect for fighting games especially if you're in the Street Fighter

29:17.080 --> 29:23.040
because you had the six buttons you had the A, B and then the little yellow buttons the

29:23.040 --> 29:28.240
C buttons or whatever they were called something like that was perfect for Street Fighter.

29:28.240 --> 29:32.040
I have to admit I got used to Street Fighter on a Super Nintendo controller like the whole

29:32.040 --> 29:35.540
fact that some of the like punches and kicks were shoulder buttons like totally didn't

29:35.540 --> 29:39.720
bother me like I just I was able to get used to it. Did you ever remember the Capcom controller

29:39.720 --> 29:43.500
that they came out for the Super Nintendo? Oh no and I thought that was on the Genesis

29:43.500 --> 29:46.800
was the special like six button. They did it in Japan. Oh really huh. The six button

29:46.800 --> 29:51.480
controller where you held a part of it in your hand and you played with the top of your

29:51.480 --> 30:00.080
fingers and it was it was kind of uncomfortable. Yeah it sounds it. And on top of that a game

30:00.080 --> 30:06.280
I regret not buying but I've actually got to play well I now finally got to buy and

30:06.280 --> 30:17.880
own is um full caliber Dreamcast. Good stuff. I wish I had GoldenEye too because yeah I

30:17.880 --> 30:22.280
mean occasionally my friend would bring it over to the daycare occasionally and he'd

30:22.280 --> 30:27.880
be over send 64 and we'd all just sit down four player multiplayer it was just epicness

30:27.880 --> 30:34.840
and you know I never owned it it was just like god now I wish I could plop some money

30:34.840 --> 30:46.040
down on that. And now the thing about it um a game that I do regret buying wow it would

30:46.040 --> 30:53.800
have to be DDR Disney Channel edition. You must have been a real DDR completionist to

30:53.800 --> 31:01.720
get that. Yeah yeah. It's a no it's another DDR worthy of the whole um bumper old bumper

31:01.720 --> 31:08.800
from Step Squad 3. This DDR sucks. It ain't a solo. Actually solo was actually pretty

31:08.800 --> 31:14.940
good. Um and solo was awesome that was some of the best music they had in DDR ever especially

31:14.940 --> 31:21.960
solo 2000 was amazing. Just saying. Yeah I think my arcade had the solo 2000 but stupid

31:21.960 --> 31:27.520
idiots trade for pump it up. Not even the same. I want to back up real quick because

31:27.520 --> 31:30.240
you were talking about like the Dreamcast and missing out on that and everything which

31:30.240 --> 31:34.080
was the same thing I said for the system that um I kind of regret not buying but then I

31:34.080 --> 31:38.520
also think about it and it's like you know at that time in my life there was no way I

31:38.520 --> 31:44.560
could have paid that type of money for that system you know I was barely out of college

31:44.560 --> 31:48.800
there and I didn't really have a job I mean I sort of worked temp jobs in the summer and

31:48.800 --> 31:54.300
so forth. There is no way I would have been able to afford one so I regret not being able

31:54.300 --> 32:00.320
to afford it I guess but I you know I couldn't buy it. I guess I can't say I don't regret

32:00.320 --> 32:05.640
not buying one because I was able to buy you know food and you know other things but. Sorry

32:05.640 --> 32:06.640
Scott.

32:06.640 --> 32:11.080
Actually I'm contrary to the whole Dreamcast thing um the babysitter my mom sent me to

32:11.080 --> 32:17.480
a bunch of times he had like a bunch of systems to play and like six or seven arcade games

32:17.480 --> 32:21.160
like in Mortal Kombat 2, Asteroids, Snow Bros.

32:21.160 --> 32:25.160
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa wait wait wait wait wait how old were you when you were going

32:25.160 --> 32:26.160
to the babysitter?

32:26.160 --> 32:28.760
I was I was like six.

32:28.760 --> 32:29.760
The Manny?

32:29.760 --> 32:30.760
Seven.

32:30.760 --> 32:36.560
Okay you they were letting you play Mortal Kombat 2 at six years old?

32:36.560 --> 32:43.920
Yeah and Mortal Kombat he had he had Final Doom on the PlayStation I played that a lot

32:43.920 --> 32:48.040
actually when one of his friends would come over we'd link up the two Playstations to

32:48.040 --> 32:56.280
play uh four player Final Doom and once again FPS epicness which that's why I ended up buying

32:56.280 --> 33:02.920
um what was it I ended up buying Doom on Xbox Live and Soul Calibur.

33:02.920 --> 33:06.880
Am I the only one that's like what's wrong with this picture why is the six-year-old

33:06.880 --> 33:14.360
being allowed to play Mortal Kombat 2 and Doom when he's with the Manny like I don't

33:14.360 --> 33:15.360
get that.

33:15.360 --> 33:22.280
Hey but but the cool thing was like not only that did I play it in his house but on the

33:22.280 --> 33:27.600
occasions I'd go over to the mall and then my mom like she was searching for me so she

33:27.600 --> 33:32.080
knew I was in the arcade section of the mall at the time and this is the same mall that

33:32.080 --> 33:39.320
won't fix the ITG machine it's still down which sucks um but at the time they had a

33:39.320 --> 33:45.120
Mortal Kombat 4 arcade machine and I would play that constantly because it was only one

33:45.120 --> 33:46.120
token to play.

33:46.120 --> 33:48.860
And how old were you eight?

33:48.860 --> 33:53.840
I was 10 and actually the first game I ever got wow actually the first game system I ever

33:53.840 --> 34:00.540
got was a Game Boy a Game Boy Pocket first two games I got one with a combo game cartridge

34:00.540 --> 34:08.720
Mortal Kombat 1 and 2 and then the other was Star Wars The Empire Strikes Back which which

34:08.720 --> 34:14.760
I loved the cantina song that would play whenever the characters were bringing up dialogue.

34:14.760 --> 34:19.400
And those games those games didn't screw you up as a kid like you're fine now you have

34:19.400 --> 34:22.520
a good sense of reality you're you're stable mentally and all that good stuff.

34:22.520 --> 34:26.520
Not pretty much like my mom was like nah nah nah it's cute violence blah blah blah it

34:26.520 --> 34:31.920
will make you go crazy I'm like really and I bought GTA Liberty City Stories behind her

34:31.920 --> 34:42.200
back on Amazon for a PSP hacking point because it was used to get the hen to activate but

34:42.200 --> 34:47.880
it ended up not working as well as I thought the hack would work but I just had fun with

34:47.880 --> 34:51.720
that and just she never knew about it.

34:51.720 --> 34:56.480
Have you told your mom recently about all these things you were playing behind her back?

34:56.480 --> 34:58.240
When you were growing up?

34:58.240 --> 35:02.240
You kind of figured out after a while what I was playing but she didn't care by the time

35:02.240 --> 35:08.720
I was she was like you know as long as here's the good thing I didn't become that stupid

35:08.720 --> 35:13.960
Virginia Tech shooter or the Von Mar shooter which you probably might have heard about

35:13.960 --> 35:20.040
yeah I've heard about them and and you know I didn't go out and shoot at the high school

35:20.040 --> 35:24.680
I didn't go out with a sniper rifle and shoot a bunch of people if I felt like I wanted

35:24.680 --> 35:29.800
to deck someone in the face I waited until I got home or got on the bus started up GTA

35:29.800 --> 35:34.760
and started beating up random civilians in the game that's that was my anger management.

35:34.760 --> 35:39.560
I like what hoofhearted says in chat saying my father didn't care that I played MK but

35:39.560 --> 35:46.840
my mom got scared and said you're going to live with your auntie in Bel Air.

35:46.840 --> 35:51.320
Alright Blaze I gotta let you go so we can try and get some more calls and do more marathon

35:51.320 --> 35:53.320
but thank you for that one last thing.

35:53.320 --> 35:59.280
Yes um okay basically the PSP in and of itself is almost like a Super Nintendo controller

35:59.280 --> 36:07.080
in and of itself with a screen this was an analog stick yes and Alpha 3 Max plays fine

36:07.080 --> 36:12.680

36:59.520 --> 37:03.480
pay very much anymore we don't have to pay for a feed anymore the fine folks at All Games

37:03.480 --> 37:08.200

37:08.200 --> 37:13.640
our mixing board yeah hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this yeah hello there good

37:13.640 --> 37:23.960
evening uh if that's sweet who's been with you all this time good morning to you my friend

37:23.960 --> 37:30.040
so gosh when we started it was probably what like midnight where you are no it was what

37:30.040 --> 37:34.880
was it if I remember no no no it was like 11 o'clock or something well that's not too

37:34.880 --> 37:40.520
bad we've been going for seven hours now so just seven and a half oh my god seven and

37:40.520 --> 37:49.680
a half hours so do the math oh whatever all right but um what was I gonna say well um

37:49.680 --> 38:00.160
yeah um Mass Effect is uh kind of interesting almost in that sense that well finally DLC

38:00.160 --> 38:06.980
for that game will will uh show up oh for yeah because that's right Mass Effect Mass

38:06.980 --> 38:13.300
Effect 2 right has it had a lot of download content come out DLC that you actually want

38:13.300 --> 38:24.020
to buy because it well because that backstory with a shadow broker is like winner huh really

38:24.020 --> 38:33.120
nice or yeah but here and uh I and I already have actually read the comic for it uh the

38:33.120 --> 38:38.520
Mass Effect Redemption Mass Effect Redemption comic what do you think which takes place

38:38.520 --> 38:48.780
actually around that before Mass Effect around that time when um well or when it takes place

38:48.780 --> 38:55.440
like before Mass Effect 2 let me ask you about this even though it's totally not to get it

38:55.440 --> 38:59.120
not the part that you wanted to call in talk about but there was a rumor last week on the

38:59.120 --> 39:04.520
show about um that I guess Matthew Fox from Lost had been cast to be the dude in a Mass

39:04.520 --> 39:10.760
Effect movie what do you think about the possibility of a Mass Effect movie Mass Effect movie would

39:10.760 --> 39:20.600
be kind of nice in some way but well how but my problem though is that my Shepard is not

39:20.600 --> 39:30.040
male she's female Shepard is female points Shepard can be whoever you want them to be

39:30.040 --> 39:35.360
that is true that is true you know um completely not what you were asking but um I only play

39:35.360 --> 39:42.840
female characters in Warcraft because people treat you better well so do I well yeah even

39:42.840 --> 39:52.240
though the uh the ironic thing about that front is that well um I didn't get to max

39:52.240 --> 40:01.160
level at um I did I didn't get to max level that soon actually because I like every time

40:01.160 --> 40:07.800
I didn't hit max level but then I think I did at some point anyway yeah because I mostly

40:07.800 --> 40:16.560
played female characters too and what happens well I roll a troll male and I and I hit max

40:16.560 --> 40:22.760
level it's funny the characters you will get most invested in out of everything else I

40:22.760 --> 40:27.000
gotta read this comment from chat real quick uh DDR dollar says uh in our chat room this

40:27.000 --> 40:31.320
caller reminds me of when I was younger and said the avatar from Ultima was female you

40:31.320 --> 40:37.720
know yeah when I played Ultima quest for the avatar on the um NES usually like half half

40:37.720 --> 40:42.040
of the different class types you could get were females and I think usually the one I

40:42.040 --> 40:47.920
would opt to play is like the druid I think or the shepherdess and both were female so

40:47.920 --> 40:53.540
you know I I totally get that reference DDR dollars saying so just kind of funny it wasn't

40:53.540 --> 40:57.040
that I was in that case it was pre-assigned if you want to be the fighter it was the male

40:57.040 --> 41:02.360
if you want to be and in Ultima 3 was the same way like the paladin in Ultima 3 was

41:02.360 --> 41:06.120
female she had a little heart for the shield which was just very precious see a little

41:06.120 --> 41:12.760
it's cute adorable anyhow so um unfortunately I can't think of any system that I regret

41:12.760 --> 41:20.400
buying in some way because I don't get any of my system buys unfortunately what about

41:20.400 --> 41:27.160
a game I might regret is that I smashed a uh smashed two game boys oh my gosh oh my

41:27.160 --> 41:34.880
gosh I really and one of them was play and I actually know they know the two uh and the

41:34.880 --> 41:40.860
two games that I did buy whatever did play well first of it was that I smashed my original

41:40.860 --> 41:49.480
game boy while while I was playing Kirby's pinball land that game was awesome some the

41:49.480 --> 41:56.560
other time was uh when I was uh I smashed my other gameboy pocket playing uh warrior

41:56.560 --> 42:01.400
land for some strange reason those Nintendo pinball games were so freaking good though

42:01.400 --> 42:06.200
like uh the pokemon pinball was so awesome I used to play that on it I don't think I

42:06.200 --> 42:13.520
would have broke a gameboy over it but you know uh oh but here's the other thing though

42:13.520 --> 42:20.080
I have uh oh but here's the other thing though I was uh much younger at that time because

42:20.080 --> 42:26.360
I was like 12 or something when I smashed my first gameboy or something I think and

42:26.360 --> 42:33.040
you've had anger management classes since then no I haven't and well and well what is

42:33.040 --> 42:39.040
it and uh and usually I don't break stuff the only thing that I've managed to break

42:39.040 --> 42:49.120
was uh oh I heard managed to break was uh and then he cut out I think we lost the connection

42:49.120 --> 42:54.600
there that's a bummer I hope we didn't lose the whole damn internet again okay good no

42:54.600 --> 42:58.280
it's still strongly disconnected and I see the chat room going there so we're good well

42:58.280 --> 43:02.000
unfortunately we lost hockey ripper but uh anger management I want to talk about this

43:02.000 --> 43:08.720
actually let's talk about your most like angry video game moment that just made you like

43:08.720 --> 43:13.760
you you wanted to break shit or something like that angry video game moment Alan it

43:13.760 --> 43:19.520
looks like you're you're thinking of something Mike Tyson's punch out um the guy in the turban

43:19.520 --> 43:23.720
that span around and he had the little gem on his turban that sparkle when he was gonna

43:23.720 --> 43:29.800
do his move tiger something yes him he brought me to tears did you actually cried I cried

43:29.800 --> 43:37.920
so much over that guy that's awesome I couldn't beat him and it just I cried would you would

43:37.920 --> 43:40.600
you actually do the whole like crying into your pillow thing where you like you throw

43:40.600 --> 43:46.320
the controller down and jump on your bed and go no it was more it was far more heart wrenching

43:46.320 --> 43:52.840
and really I was can you describe I was utterly defeated as a person my nine ten year old

43:52.840 --> 43:59.000
self just had like these bitter tears of several people in chat thank you great tiger was his

43:59.000 --> 44:03.960
name you've you've clearly tried to block that from your mind great tiger made you cry

44:03.960 --> 44:09.420
yeah I want to like make you like a little like t-shirt or something like with this picture

44:09.420 --> 44:14.080
on a great tiger made me cry and here's the thing I actually got up to Mike Tyson in that

44:14.080 --> 44:19.640
game and I never actually beat it because he was impossible but yet I was like this

44:19.640 --> 44:26.880
is I was like this is just stupid how hard this is so then I just stopped playing to

44:26.880 --> 44:34.160
Mike Tyson but did that one boss I just cried I think I've thrown controllers like power

44:34.160 --> 44:38.840
outages have made me thrown controllers which is very frustrating I can't think of like

44:38.840 --> 44:43.960
any boss fights or anything that have really driven me to that or or cry I didn't get a

44:43.960 --> 44:49.080
drop in Wow the other day and that no I'm kidding I'm kidding I'm not that bad I'll

44:49.080 --> 44:56.640
do the Huffy stomp I'll do the yeah you roll like in 95 and then someone else that happened

44:56.640 --> 45:02.880
that fucking shit happened last week I knew it and you were like no it's okay and like

45:02.880 --> 45:07.920
you type to chat you're like oh it's okay congratulations I'm glad you want it but I'm

45:07.920 --> 45:11.620
like he's fucking sitting there fucking throwing a fit like these probably like pillows are

45:11.620 --> 45:17.280
getting thrown in his place right now god damn it why do we even fucking do these rooms

45:17.280 --> 45:23.440
I hope that drop was worth it when I push you down the stairs next time I see you anger

45:23.440 --> 45:27.560
management dark soccer any any moment in gaming where you've just gotten so angry you wanted

45:27.560 --> 45:32.120
to break something playing Dan and x-men versus Street Fighter I just wanted to take the controller

45:32.120 --> 45:36.640
and embed it firmly into his skull because see Dan back in the day and he's still like

45:36.640 --> 45:42.400
this to a degree but not nearly as bad as it used to be Dan likes to gloat and likes

45:42.400 --> 45:49.280
to be alpha male you know big junk you don't say and back in the day he had that problem

45:49.280 --> 45:55.880
even more and so he would kick my ass soundly until I would play cami and gambit and he

45:55.880 --> 46:01.440
would just haha haha you know he was Nelson but he would be really dickly about it and

46:01.440 --> 46:06.200
finally I'm like I'm just gonna beat you with this controller I beat Alan with my shoe last

46:06.200 --> 46:10.580
night how was it Alan I'll tell you was it hot let me tell you about this in a minute

46:10.580 --> 46:15.080
actually uh because we have a call story we have a seriously who uses a shoe all right

46:15.080 --> 46:20.320
uh caller you're on the air hi who's this I haven't derailed you guys just derailed

46:20.320 --> 46:24.280
me with the talk about their shoe this is the like third time you've called in tonight

46:24.280 --> 46:28.000
but that's okay what's on your mind yeah you must be tired of me calling all the damn time

46:28.000 --> 46:32.880
it's all right it's all good what's on your mind I guess I have an interesting Xbox Live

46:32.880 --> 46:38.880
story which in turn I end up getting two months free service out of them okay how'd this work

46:38.880 --> 46:45.560
well I always buy the cards to reload my subscription it's a rarity that I actually log in with

46:45.560 --> 46:50.840
my credit card give my information to rip me for a month or two now the last time this

46:50.840 --> 46:55.700
happened they start automatically debiting my card I'm like no don't do that and I set

46:55.700 --> 47:01.460
it to make sure that it would not do that so what I had so you know I figured I'd go

47:01.460 --> 47:07.120
back to the card you know refill one month or two they had like that one dollar special

47:07.120 --> 47:11.280
so I'm like you know what I'm going to sign up for that so I signed up for about two months

47:11.280 --> 47:17.200
of service and then I went out and got another card they get an email from saying that they

47:17.200 --> 47:23.440
were unable to bill my card because the card was invalid so I shrugged it off like no big

47:23.440 --> 47:27.820
deal you would think that they would see it in the system I automatically re-upped my

47:27.820 --> 47:35.960
account for another year every two three weeks I would get an email about that then one week

47:35.960 --> 47:42.860
in July I figured I'd jump on fire something on Netflix I go in and it says that my account

47:42.860 --> 47:49.960
is back to silver and I'm like what the hell is going on I call them up asking them why

47:49.960 --> 47:56.720
did they cancel my account and they said I did not pay for it and I'm explaining to them

47:56.720 --> 48:04.400
if you see in the system I purchased a one year card so that makes no sense so here I

48:04.400 --> 48:09.720
am screaming at the poor guy in India who in turn is like the best thing is to get you

48:09.720 --> 48:15.480
a supervisor I'm like yeah put him on I'm explaining the whole situation he's like my

48:15.480 --> 48:20.920
hands are tied there's nothing I can do at that point I just drop a nuclear bomb because

48:20.920 --> 48:26.760
I'm just beyond aggravated about all of this and he goes what what we can do to have a

48:26.760 --> 48:33.760
manager call you back within 48 hours fine here's my number call mecca 48 hours nope

48:33.760 --> 48:42.680
nothing absolutely nothing so I go online wait wait wait I'm missing okay they were

48:42.680 --> 48:47.680
set up to charge you automatically no I canceled that okay you canceled that but they tried

48:47.680 --> 48:53.500
to do it anyway yes and then you use prepaid cards yes and what were they doing were they

48:53.500 --> 48:57.400
adding it to the time in the past that you hadn't paid for where you were like I don't

48:57.400 --> 49:02.980
want to use this or I don't I'm still lost right now what it was doing the card was supposed

49:02.980 --> 49:08.760
to kick in after I paid for one month which was in April okay so my lie was supposed to

49:08.760 --> 49:16.260
go from May 2010 to May I guess May 2011 April 2011 okay but I kept getting the email saying

49:16.260 --> 49:21.880
that they were not able to build my car for my account and yet I it's it's listed that

49:21.880 --> 49:27.900
I already have a year with them oh so for some reason they're still trying to charge

49:27.900 --> 49:33.320
your card even though you put the prepaid one on right now I get it okay so the manager

49:33.320 --> 49:40.760
manager never called me back so I go on to the consumerist find like contacts from Microsoft

49:40.760 --> 49:45.900
I sent emails to Steve Ballmer and somebody else in charge at Microsoft with Xbox live

49:45.900 --> 49:52.880
nice within two days I get a call from the manager I explained everything he profuse

49:52.880 --> 49:57.980
he apologizes and goes into the system it seems that on the supervisor's end they don't

49:57.980 --> 50:05.060
have access to billing that's crazy like what's the point then you think there ought to be

50:05.060 --> 50:11.480
somebody that can fix it you know it's just weird yeah very I'm like I'm yelling at the

50:11.480 --> 50:15.580
guy log into your system and fix it oh we don't have access to that how do you not have

50:15.580 --> 50:20.480
access to you know uh gold anthro in our chat room at chat dot orange laundry dot com says

50:20.480 --> 50:25.620
it's because of shit like this that I'm just gonna stick to prepaid cards now I don't blame

50:25.620 --> 50:31.300
him but you know damn it a dollar for a month is a good deal you can't beat that that is

50:31.300 --> 50:36.060
that is a very good deal all right Rama anything else you wanna say real quick cuz we're gonna

50:36.060 --> 50:40.900
get back to angry games and beating with shoes and stuff in a minute long story short the

50:40.900 --> 50:48.660
guy contacts me back he canceled my my gold sends me a new code so now I'm good from July

50:48.660 --> 50:53.900
to like June of 2011 so I end up getting like two extra months out of the deal must be nice

50:53.900 --> 50:59.180
yeah so in the moral of the story is yelling at the supervisor fixes the trick every time

50:59.180 --> 51:03.220
I'm kidding I'm kidding don't I used to work in a call center please don't sometimes they're

51:03.220 --> 51:08.060
I know don't yell at them if they can't help you find me I'll give you an email address

51:08.060 --> 51:13.460
to somebody to take care of it for you yeah exactly all right all right Rama I'm gonna

51:13.460 --> 51:17.420
let you go for real have a good one okay buddy okay good I need more vodka all right good

51:17.420 --> 51:22.900
luck have fun all right where were we oh yes beating with shoes and Alan's like I want

51:22.900 --> 51:31.340
to tell this story yeah so Rob does not parallel park he doesn't in San Francisco near where

51:31.340 --> 51:37.700
I live parking is more precious than platinum or gold so if you see a space especially if

51:37.700 --> 51:43.540
it's a rock star space right in front of where you're going you park in it but you know if

51:43.540 --> 51:47.580
you're used to parking lots and you can't parallel park you just say fuck that and you

51:47.580 --> 51:53.500
keep going so whenever Rob under extreme duress has to parallel park I will basically tease

51:53.500 --> 51:59.860
the hell out of him for it because he usually will not try and last night when we were going

51:59.860 --> 52:04.460
to his rocky horror performance there were basically three blocks of parallel parking

52:04.460 --> 52:09.180
without cars so he just had to like drive in and sort of scoot his car up to the edge

52:09.180 --> 52:13.140
and I was like I don't know are you sure you can handle it it's parallel parking so he

52:13.140 --> 52:18.780
takes his shoe off and starts whapping me with it no no it was I said I if you better

52:18.780 --> 52:24.460
be quieter I'm gonna beat you in my shoe and then I think I like hit the curb with parking

52:24.460 --> 52:29.060
yeah see and then finally he stops the car he's like oh wait how far away from the curb

52:29.060 --> 52:35.780
am I and I'm like there's no one here like my original making fun of you still stands

52:35.780 --> 52:40.500
and then he took his shoe off and he hit me with it well you deserved it yeah you know

52:40.500 --> 52:46.300
I'm not I'm not one to advocate domestic violence but you know so yeah he gives me stink eye

52:46.300 --> 52:50.500
for making fun of his parallel parking and then he you know stops the car and we're like

52:50.500 --> 52:54.820
five feet away from the curb with no cars he didn't have to wiggle wiggle in at all

52:54.820 --> 53:00.420
no not at all yeah good times yeah I agree with brake man in our chat room fuck parallel

53:00.420 --> 53:06.020
parking I agree with that and misty says fuck driving that's your that's your attitude that's

53:06.020 --> 53:10.540
where I'm at yeah what is it about driving that you're just you're just not gonna do

53:10.540 --> 53:19.500
it the expense in you know car payment gas insurance someone gets drunk and hit you you're

53:19.500 --> 53:26.220
dead you know it's just it's awful but it's really nice like being able to go wherever

53:26.220 --> 53:31.180
you want whenever you want like that's really you don't have to rely on really anyone else

53:31.180 --> 53:37.660
just saying I had the internet at home I don't have to go anywhere what about food Amazon

53:37.660 --> 53:41.860
will ship it what about if it's like oh my god I need some pink berry right now or I'm

53:41.860 --> 53:49.340
gonna like kill somebody I went there I heard they played Abba mm-hmm amazing I had the

53:49.340 --> 53:56.100
chocolate with the the hazelnut crunch stuff on it and I wanted to die it was good I've

53:56.100 --> 54:00.140
been telling you it's amazing I love the way that place is designed it's cute very cute

54:00.140 --> 54:05.860
little place sorry to derail that's okay misty and chat says it's a combo of the expense

54:05.860 --> 54:11.360
the idiots on the road and my fail attention span long drives can be tough like sometimes

54:11.360 --> 54:16.060
I'm like oh I want to take like a really long drive like I'm gonna go drive across country

54:16.060 --> 54:19.980
or I'll drive like I'll do something crazy like go drive to Kansas and visit Shane is

54:19.980 --> 54:24.420
like halfway across the country or I'll drive up to Canada like Vancouver or something and

54:24.420 --> 54:30.260
then I'm like oh god that would be so grueling though like at the drive there is not usually

54:30.260 --> 54:35.820
the bad part it's the drive home like our Portland trip right yeah I thought we were

54:35.820 --> 54:41.200
making well we were making really good time we got through Oregon I was like this is great

54:41.200 --> 54:45.220
you know this isn't bothering me at all they don't then once we got into Reading California

54:45.220 --> 54:50.560
and realized there were still what three four hours after the drive wanted to die get me

54:50.560 --> 54:54.740
out of this car it's tough I think dark soccer has done a similar drive right haven't you

54:54.740 --> 54:59.100
driven all the way up to southern Washington we right we drove to Prosser Washington pretty

54:59.100 --> 55:04.460
much just as far I think last year we did the drive drive drive up there is great well

55:04.460 --> 55:11.460
Dan drove I slept and he would stop me on the way back for snow talking more about angry

55:11.460 --> 55:15.320
games I didn't ask Bradley this question yet I gotta see I cuz Bradley's one of those very

55:15.320 --> 55:20.020
quiet like if you can't tell he's very quiet very shy does it does not get angry I gotta

55:20.020 --> 55:23.140
ask him if he's ever gotten angry he's like I'm gonna kill this bitch wait hold on hold

55:23.140 --> 55:26.340
on I gotta say this chat comment real quick though xlink in our chat room talking about

55:26.340 --> 55:31.380
angry stuff I got upset when a certain member of my guild had won the role for the battered

55:31.380 --> 55:35.460
hilt twice and then decided to give one of them to his boyfriend that likes to beat him

55:35.460 --> 55:49.060
with his shoe yeah I love that that's your response yeah yeah that was me all right

55:49.060 --> 55:57.460
Bradley yeah well I do get very angry at games sometimes I can't remember like any specific

55:57.460 --> 56:03.620
really really big incidents I know throwing controllers all the time I was a kid good

56:03.620 --> 56:08.100
thing about Genesis controllers is they're there you can always fix them pretty much

56:08.100 --> 56:14.020
like Saturn controller there that I think that the round controller that wasn't Saturn

56:14.020 --> 56:19.380
was it and there's one of them has the the shoulder button has like a magnet if you hit

56:19.380 --> 56:24.020
it wrong it'll detach the magnet and you can't if you can't because it works with a magnet

56:24.020 --> 56:29.580
somehow and so if it's not attached in the right place it won't work so that for that

56:29.580 --> 56:34.900
and then I know last week when I was playing burnout revenge anytime was I screwing up

56:34.900 --> 56:41.760
a bunch out yeah that would go screaming going oh fuck you god damn it it's so funny how

56:41.760 --> 56:47.260
Nintendo like puts out this like very family-friendly system you know and it's like oh you know

56:47.260 --> 56:50.820
oh we have to use friend codes so that children don't hear naughty language and did it up

56:50.820 --> 56:55.100
but I remember back in the day in college playing Super Mario Kart in the dorms and

56:55.100 --> 56:59.900
we would say the filthiest shit while playing that game like you know talking about each

56:59.900 --> 57:06.860
other our mothers you know the sex stuff and just all this stuff while playing you know

57:06.860 --> 57:12.020
Mario Kart it got ugly very ugly but it's not my fault I whoop them all with toad because

57:12.020 --> 57:20.880

he is great and be all like hell froze over lol yeah you're like this isn't funny I want

57:39.900 --> 57:46.700
to change the topic let's see break man in chat says long drives are fine as long as

57:46.700 --> 57:53.040
your wife or girlfriend sleeps lol well my girlfriend just keeps telling me how bad of

57:53.040 --> 58:01.160
a driver I am bitch I know I'm a bad driver close your eyes you won't notice nice oh hey

58:01.160 --> 58:04.860
the phone's ringing why don't we answer it hi you're on orange launch radio who's this

58:04.860 --> 58:16.260
hey what's on your mind to say oh um actually uh I was hoping to talk about infamous too

58:16.260 --> 58:20.300
well okay what's up what do you think of infamous to tell us a little bit about it for those

58:20.300 --> 58:26.020
that don't know what infamous is all about uh well I haven't actually played the game

58:26.020 --> 58:32.380
so I don't really know a whole lot about the story but uh apparently um some world ending

58:32.380 --> 58:40.060
between a warbird disaster strikes and hero appears by the name of coal and he has electrical

58:40.060 --> 58:46.940
powers now what I want to talk about the second one is um how are they going to integrate

58:46.940 --> 58:56.300
the uh um ice abilities into the uh gameplay mechanics because from what I played on the

58:56.300 --> 59:05.620
um um sorry from what I played on the demo for the first one um everything just kind

59:05.620 --> 59:10.460
of melded together for the electrical abilities so I'm just wondering how that would work

59:10.460 --> 59:14.780
unfortunately it's not a series I'm on the up and up on Loki's kind of the expert about

59:14.780 --> 59:20.380
those and he's not here so uh I don't know is infamous a series you've read up on at

59:20.380 --> 59:25.060
all Alan Jamie anybody I don't know much about this I bought it but I haven't played it oh

59:25.060 --> 59:34.540

59:57.700 --> 01:00:02.860

01:00:02.860 --> 01:00:10.140
why it's uh because it's not out yet Beyonce wrote a song about it and now she owns the

01:01:53.380 --> 01:01:56.340
it probably doesn't turn out that long in the podcast because we have been taking musical

01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:24.420

01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:53.160
because we love you we'll do them tonight how's that sound works for me all right awesome

01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:57.620
meanwhile twitter we uh we never got around to uh doing the tweets that were sent us in

01:02:57.620 --> 01:03:01.980
the last uh segment because i asked for some tweets and we got on tangents talking about

01:03:01.980 --> 01:03:07.360
angry games and and the callers that we had and all that good stuff so uh i'm gonna try

01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:13.680
to get to some tweets but i don't have the twitter music i can't do tweets without the

01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:20.320
twitter music oh my gosh it's all i ruined everything we have to stop the marathon it's

01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:27.000
done nose i'm kidding yeah when you were out getting pizza i deleted all of the native

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:44.520
olr music files they're gone you jerk all right i found it phew we love our twitter

01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:53.400
oh uh to care a saying uh how is the final fantasy 14 beta isn't it just a prettier ff11

01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:57.480
yeah pretty much it's ff11 with different combat and this whole guild left thing that

01:03:57.480 --> 01:04:01.840
makes no sense to me whatsoever the biggest problem with final fantasy 11 is that it doesn't

01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:06.240
hand hold you at all and like i i agree some games overdo it with the hand holding but

01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:09.640
what was the most frustrating thing about final fantasy 11 the fact that it just plunked

01:04:09.640 --> 01:04:16.960
you in the middle of a town and was like decay by the people yeah um so final fantasy 14

01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:22.340
is it's the beta is really crowded i couldn't figure out what to do like i couldn't figure

01:04:22.340 --> 01:04:26.040
out that there was like a whole nother map level i was supposed to go to and like activate

01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:30.640
a switch like you would think the game would lead you through the first couple quests just

01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:34.840
to kind of like give you a tutorial like you know about how the game works the interface

01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:38.880
you know maybe it's because it's a beta not all of that's built in yet but i just the

01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:42.320
beta left me feeling very frustrated and that's why i'm kind of laughing at all this like

01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:48.320
closed betas or the open beta stuff going on is i'm like guys it's not worth your time

01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:52.220
okay but hey it's a free game and at least you'll know if you can uh buy it when it comes

01:04:52.220 --> 01:04:56.000
out or not but i honestly think the game is going to tank i think it's going to tank bad

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:59.560
especially for a final fantasy game like i think they're expecting it to do really well

01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:09.080
it's not going to do nearly the business 13 did but we'll see um dj blaiskin said of several

01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:14.040
tweets and usually i limit people to two tweets but hey it's the marathon why not so dj blaiskin

01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:20.760
says what's cuter than a cat playing duck hunt nothing and sends us this uh tweet or

01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:25.240
sorry an article via twitter and i actually did see this it's a video on youtube of a

01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:32.480
kitty who's actually playing duck hunt and they start the game there and then the kid

01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:35.720
this is terrible radio but i don't care and the cat see the cat's like scratching the

01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:41.160
dog with her paws and oh i'm going for the next like attacking the ducks even though

01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:48.760
they fly off screen it's adorable tell me that's not adorable it's adorable cats are

01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:56.320
so damn cute uh let's see dj blaiskin says don't bother watching football this season

01:05:56.320 --> 01:06:00.600
madden 11 already picked all the winners and lead us to a news story about how i guess

01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:04.400
uh all the winners are already uh it's been determined because you know there's all the

01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:09.400
statistics in madden and everything um the ravens and packers will be the conference

01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:16.840
winners so there it is so i just i lol super bowl spoilers i think the football star that

01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:22.640
actually is on the cover of madden has the madden curse so like if you're the guy who's

01:06:22.640 --> 01:06:28.980
on the box the box art they have a horrible season after the game comes out i think that's

01:06:28.980 --> 01:06:32.800
like a thing i don't know i don't follow it is i've heard that i've heard the same thing

01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:37.640
they always get injured or something happens yeah who was on the cover this year i wasn't

01:06:37.640 --> 01:06:47.200
paying attention was it brett farve people like him tiger woods david beckham that's

01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:55.040

01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:30.840
really done what was the combat in valkyrie profile for those that don't know um it was

01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:40.360
a weird hybrid of uh active time battle and um real time all right i had really insane

01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:46.360
combos in it like street fighter why maniac mansion because it's iconic and it was the

01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:52.320
first game that really brought um comedy into adventure gaming and it had a modern setting

01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:58.440
as teenagers in present day whereas all adventure games up till then was like adventure or sci-fi

01:16:58.440 --> 01:17:02.480
you know and they had the saturday morning show like later on didn't it when they're

01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:08.280
like a saturday morning maniac mansion show or something i barely remember that i think

01:17:08.280 --> 01:17:14.160
you're right though i'm almost positive there was did you actually play that through to

01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:18.000
completion is it is it true you can beat it with every combination of characters or no

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:26.000
you can't can't do it with all of them there are hmm i know that there are two or three

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:29.720
characters that it's really preferred that you have at least one of them in there but

01:17:29.720 --> 01:17:33.480
yeah i think you can beat it with all with any three wait here you go here you go look

01:17:33.480 --> 01:17:34.480
at this blast in the past

01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:53.360
this is live action yeah it was a live action show tv show oh my gosh i remember that it

01:17:53.360 --> 01:18:02.320
was like almost like a drama the way the credits make it look like huh

01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:06.760
let's see let me see if i can go oh it's created by eugene levee really let's see wait there's

01:18:06.760 --> 01:18:14.800
a i think it ran for like three episodes before they pulled the plug on it

01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:19.480
you can't underestimate these fly instincts you know jesus has to look at me with those

01:18:19.480 --> 01:18:23.680
big baby blacks i can't fly for a minute if you know what i mean this is like a scene

01:18:23.680 --> 01:18:30.040
out of twin peaks or something there she is this is creepy i don't like this all right

01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:35.200
yeah this is upsetting is it ruining your memory of the show or is it ruining your memory

01:18:35.200 --> 01:18:41.120
of the game is it making you like it has nothing to do with the game so all right yeah but

01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:48.320
it said in the credits based on the lucas film game just so you know

01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:52.400
you look like you're about to beat me with that microphone it's all right all right um

01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:58.680
hey save it for when you get home my favorite video game oh promise my favorite video game

01:18:58.680 --> 01:19:01.480
of all time and if you don't already know this you haven't been listening to the show

01:19:01.480 --> 01:19:05.660
uh super metroid is my favorite video game of all time it was even mentioned during this

01:19:05.660 --> 01:19:12.440
show it was bob grabbed my copy earlier in the show it's great i love it and yet i haven't

01:19:12.440 --> 01:19:16.560
bought metroid other m because i am afraid it's terrible like i just i have been i've

01:19:16.560 --> 01:19:20.160
heard from people it's great i've been hearing mixed things on it and i'm very worried and

01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:28.120
i have to hook up my we to play it i don't want to look at the solution netflix what

01:19:28.120 --> 01:19:32.920
or gamefly or whatever oh game i was like netflix you can get games to netflix too yeah

01:19:32.920 --> 01:19:38.320
i could do the net or the netfly the gamefly thing but that would involve me again getting

01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:44.080
the motivation to hook up the weed my tv and that means you know rob it takes 10 freaking

01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:49.120
minutes not my house you've had a gamefly account since like march that's been rotting

01:19:49.120 --> 01:19:54.160
yeah i don't i don't really ever use it it's kind of sad i don't know is it worth it should

01:19:54.160 --> 01:20:02.720
i play metroid other m if i'm such a stand for super metroid chat vote yn let's see break

01:20:14.360 --> 01:20:20.320
um we'll see uh bradley times up do you think of something i think i'd probably go with

01:20:20.320 --> 01:20:27.060
a panther dragoon saga it's a just a really epic game and so one one game when the first

01:20:27.060 --> 01:20:31.460
time i saw the battle system i got whoa that's awesome just because it's just a different

01:20:31.460 --> 01:20:35.560
system and seeing that you fly upside you're flying right next to the enemies that you're

01:20:35.560 --> 01:20:39.640
fighting it's like well this is really really really neat because you're flying around them

01:20:39.640 --> 01:20:47.040
in a circle uh and then you and then you attack based on that yeah so and then just a really

01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:54.300
cool storyline that and lots like uh lots of things to explore and uh neat things never

01:20:54.300 --> 01:20:57.360
played it sadly i think i've played all the other games that have been mentioned but i've

01:20:57.360 --> 01:21:02.840
never played that for some sick reason i'm just not cool yeah well it was only a limited

01:21:02.840 --> 01:21:09.040
edition and all that kind of stuff it's definitely worth applying i wanted to say that only 6,000

01:21:09.040 --> 01:21:13.800
copies were printed in the us when it came out something like wow no wonder it's so expensive

01:21:13.800 --> 01:21:19.360
let's see some folks in chat about uh metroid other m yes yes yes why why but then i got

01:21:19.360 --> 01:21:23.920
a private message that says it sucks so maybe the people who think it sucks don't want to

stories about how terrible my ex was so how was it having me in the game versus having my ex in

01:31:12.020 --> 01:31:22.340
the game allegedly um it it took extra time he slowed things down you your very first quest you

01:31:22.340 --> 01:31:29.860
were in a basement with shells and he decided that he wanted to climb these shelves to get a better

01:31:29.860 --> 01:31:42.900
look at the surroundings of the basement and i can see that happening once but he tried it at least

01:31:42.900 --> 01:31:51.620
three times one of which he rolled a natural one and knocked over the shelf which is just like real

01:31:51.620 --> 01:32:05.220
life allegedly allegedly this is fantastic oh yeah he he he was interesting um he was special yes

01:32:05.220 --> 01:32:11.140
but he's not here anymore that's the important thing right no he kept thinking that the cleric

01:32:11.140 --> 01:32:18.420
was a priest and he kept trying to cast his wow spells in dnd cast smite smite no he's

01:32:18.420 --> 01:32:22.420
he went i want the bubble a casa bubble i want casa bubble

01:32:27.060 --> 01:32:32.500

01:32:38.820 --> 01:32:43.540

01:32:48.100 --> 01:33:00.420
of adventures do you do in dnd now um right now they're not too ridiculous um but there was a big

01:33:00.420 --> 01:33:09.380
asshole who everyone kind of hates who's the big hero of the town his name's larbio and he's

01:33:09.380 --> 01:33:18.580
modeled after fabio only more sexual harassment involved does his hair have its own saving throw

01:33:18.580 --> 01:33:20.900

01:33:23.220 --> 01:33:32.500

01:33:32.500 --> 01:33:42.500
light and the thing about that was it glowed in the dark that's that's fantastic i i your game's

01:33:42.500 --> 01:33:50.420
totally rock yeah i know all right um yeah i you know one of these days nathan i'm gonna have to

01:33:50.420 --> 01:33:54.820
drop in and make a cameo if i could find my old character sheet although to be honest i think it's

01:33:54.820 --> 01:33:59.380
long gone i think it's like in that box of like things that remind me of the x that got shredded

01:33:59.380 --> 01:34:03.300
like you know when i left so sadly i don't know if i have it anymore but i'll have to make a cameo

01:34:03.300 --> 01:34:08.980
at some point in your game it'll be fun every once in a while we've done some drunk dnd nights

01:34:08.980 --> 01:34:17.460
we've done two of those yeah so far and uh eddie has actually come to those so and one time we

01:34:17.460 --> 01:34:25.060
played the campaign module that the guys from penny arcade had made i was making fun of the

01:34:25.060 --> 01:34:33.380
twilight movies very nice very nice so uh yeah you're more than welcome to stop by uh that would

01:34:33.380 --> 01:34:37.540
be a perfect time because we don't do any big campaign it's just something stupid we get drunk

01:34:37.540 --> 01:34:48.100
and laugh and i i will absolutely do that and i'll cast bubble can i cast bubble no no not not wow

01:34:48.740 --> 01:34:52.900

broken the groups so we had to go to different vendors the very first thing we saw in my group

01:39:29.780 --> 01:39:35.140
was a like a trailer of tons of different fatalities from the new moral combat game

01:39:35.140 --> 01:39:41.220
and they were hilarious and any that you remember what any that you remember

01:39:41.220 --> 01:39:46.740
oh yeah um there was one where reptile threw up in somebody's mouth like a whole bunch of acid

01:39:46.740 --> 01:39:54.260
that was funny pick us up like that once actually there was one where sector like blew up somebody's

01:39:54.260 --> 01:39:59.460
torso and like a few different pieces and as the pieces were flying at the air he locked onto each

01:39:59.460 --> 01:40:05.620
individual piece and shot missiles at them so made them explode even more okay um there was one where

01:40:05.620 --> 01:40:11.940
there was one where squirt can cut like i don't feel like right through the guy at the waistline

01:40:11.940 --> 01:40:16.340
and he didn't fall over anything and then he cut the guy through the neck all the way through and

01:40:16.340 --> 01:40:21.620
then he like kicked the torso so just the torso flew and then the head flew up and he took his

01:40:21.620 --> 01:40:27.060
little knife and sliced the head in half i was like oh that's hilarious this is sounding like

01:40:27.060 --> 01:40:33.060
a song what were the stage the stage ones did you see any of those no they didn't show any stage

01:40:33.060 --> 01:40:39.380
ones but they did show um in the new uh acid pit place or old acid pit place i guess you would call

01:40:39.380 --> 01:40:45.380
it um one of the background dudes that was hanging like you saw him get dipped into the acid he was

01:40:45.380 --> 01:40:49.460
like screaming and freaking out and then they pulled him back up and he wasn't a skeleton he

01:40:49.460 --> 01:40:55.620
was like this fleshy dead like dripping thing it was awesome that's fantastic rose was it like the

01:40:55.620 --> 01:41:03.700
mortal kombat 2 um acid pit yeah yeah nice oh i want this game that that sounds hot they also

01:41:03.700 --> 01:41:11.860
i don't know if this has come out yet but i don't care um because yeah they had tag team like uh

01:41:11.860 --> 01:41:16.260
combo things like they do in like the marvel vs capcom game so you could be beating somebody up

01:41:16.260 --> 01:41:23.300
and then tag in another partner and they'll jump right in oh wow yeah it was crazy cool that's

01:41:23.300 --> 01:41:28.500
interesting so they stole that from uh marvel vs capcom it sounds like it's awesome yeah and i

01:41:28.500 --> 01:41:34.660
don't know if any other games did it before but probably not um let's see what else was cool there

01:41:34.660 --> 01:41:44.820
uh not a lot um no that was the coolest thing i think i saw which is kind of sad um i did get

01:41:44.820 --> 01:41:50.260
to play Diablo 3 um i didn't know how to play it i tried to play it like wow and that got me killed

01:41:50.260 --> 01:41:55.700
pretty quick and i was just like okay i'm done i give up it's cool i need to play it i understand

01:41:55.700 --> 01:42:00.100
that i'm terrible at it and i won't buy it you're not gonna buy it diablo is awesome it's better

01:42:00.100 --> 01:42:04.820
than i i like it better than starcraft i'm gonna get my i'm not buying for starcraft either but

01:42:04.820 --> 01:42:09.700
if they give me a wild pet maybe and i'll get it well what have you been doing because i i know you

01:42:09.700 --> 01:42:15.140
were able to get into the cata beta as well um what have you been doing in the cata beta um i

01:42:15.140 --> 01:42:22.500
have played a warden up to 12 almost and then a goblin up to four because that's where the quest

01:42:22.500 --> 01:42:29.060
is currently broken we can't proceed so the organs you know pretty cool the game doesn't feel like

01:42:29.060 --> 01:42:34.020
wow i'll say that right now it does not feel like the same game we've been playing for so many years

01:42:34.020 --> 01:42:38.580
um just going through the wargon and goblin experience but the wargons all depressing you

01:42:38.580 --> 01:42:44.820
know we gotta save our home from these attacks oh my god we're gonna die and god was like

01:42:44.820 --> 01:42:51.540
let me get some like bling glasses and i got running over people with my car and it's the best

01:42:51.540 --> 01:42:57.540
love the goblin area so so much wasn't that the entire time wasn't that working quest with the

01:42:57.540 --> 01:43:03.540
barrels uh on the abomination's heads like the best thing ever though i didn't know what to do

01:43:03.540 --> 01:43:07.460
at first i was like i'm really close to this guy why am i not throwing the barrel no you have to

01:43:07.460 --> 01:43:12.340
like get right up next to him but yeah that was pretty funny and i laughed at that stuff too it

01:43:12.340 --> 01:43:18.740
was awesome um i'm gonna do a spoiler for the the wargon quest line uh you know whatever sure um

01:43:18.740 --> 01:43:23.300
because it was there's a fun glitch that happened there's a part where you're fighting sylvanas

01:43:23.300 --> 01:43:28.900
and uh like you're like the whole town is fighting sylvanas and she knocks you back and

01:43:28.900 --> 01:43:34.900
she's about to shoot uh again graymane the leader of the wargon people uh with this poison arrow i

01:43:34.900 --> 01:43:41.300
guess but instead his son jumps in front to take the arrow but when i played she was facing the

01:43:41.300 --> 01:43:48.420
opposite direction so she shot like facing to the screen's left and the prince was right behind her

01:43:48.420 --> 01:43:54.420
but it still killed and i was like that just ruins the mood interesting did you see the um part in

01:43:54.420 --> 01:43:58.820
the wargon quest line where it's like we're gonna insert a movie here of you getting transformed

01:43:58.820 --> 01:44:04.420
into a wargon or one of the characters says that i didn't see that part i just i just skipped over

01:44:04.420 --> 01:44:09.220
it i think scroll back up a few times it's funny it's in the church yeah it's it's right and when

01:44:09.220 --> 01:44:12.820
you transform when you go from the church to when you're in the gallows thing not to ruin it but

01:44:12.820 --> 01:44:16.660
i did so oh yeah yeah i think there was one there but i didn't see anything on screen telling me

01:44:16.660 --> 01:44:22.100
that something was going to happen i just i knew it was going to happen but no no yeah i don't

01:44:22.100 --> 01:44:26.500
really care about my work immediately as much as i don't care about the goblin now because goblin is

01:44:26.500 --> 01:44:35.540
so funny like the music is all like i don't know whimsical when you play it's a goblin and your

01:44:35.540 --> 01:44:44.980
radio that goes only to uh 11. but yeah i like it it's it's not wow what we're used to but it's

01:44:44.980 --> 01:44:50.420
it's neat it's the evolution of the game all right you haven't checked out any of the new areas yet

01:44:50.420 --> 01:44:53.620
because that's what i'm waiting to do like i want my stupid character to copy over so i can check

01:44:53.620 --> 01:45:00.740
out the new areas i i still can't get my character to copy over um i'm just i'm at dark shore now

01:45:00.740 --> 01:45:07.380
i think that's why i'm at um so i'll get to see that area redone but no no character copying over

01:45:07.380 --> 01:45:14.580
it's been keeping me a little sad no i was having the same problem what can you do all right well

01:45:14.580 --> 01:45:19.540
uh if anyone here in the studio have questions for shane if not i'm gonna let him go and uh we're

01:45:19.540 --> 01:45:25.140
gonna get back to our show sound good all right get back to our marathon marathoning all right

01:45:25.140 --> 01:45:32.660
well any last thoughts for our listeners shane um yes uh you know like a month ago i wouldn't have

01:45:32.660 --> 01:45:38.420
ever said this but i think i'm a huge microsoft down boy now why because of all the free stuff

01:45:38.420 --> 01:45:44.020
they threw at us at conference and f you the sony and nintendo for not trying to win our affection

01:45:44.020 --> 01:45:50.500
by giving us lots of free stuff so your loyalty can be bought yes so if i pay you like 20 you'll

01:45:50.500 --> 01:45:56.980
wear like an orange lounge radio sticker to work uh i'll wear a sticker yeah like can i wear

01:45:56.980 --> 01:46:06.820
stickers will you wear a shirt no i can't wear a shirt that says orange lounge tour fail um but

01:46:06.820 --> 01:46:14.900
i'll pretend and i'll still take the twenty dollars that's all right we're letting you go

01:46:14.900 --> 01:46:22.180
you're useless to me without being able to promote all right take care all right you too bye all

01:46:22.180 --> 01:46:30.420
right thank you shane for being on appreciate the phone calls good times um let's see which

01:46:30.420 --> 01:46:34.740
would i never played the rest of this um uh dungeons and dragons thing so should i finish

01:46:34.740 --> 01:46:39.300
this even though like yes food is gone or start it over start it over why not all right why not

01:46:39.300 --> 01:46:48.180
why dungeons and dragons satan's game your children like it or not are attracted in their

01:46:48.180 --> 01:46:54.980
weaker years to the occult and a game like dnd fuels their imagination and makes them feel

01:46:54.980 --> 01:47:02.500
special while drawing them deeper and deeper into the bowels of el diablo this afternoon the dead

01:47:02.500 --> 01:47:09.700
ale wives watchtower invites you to sit in on an actual gaming session observe the previously

01:47:09.700 --> 01:47:16.980
unobservable as a hidden camera takes you to the inner sanctum of dungeons and dragons

gallstaff you have entered the door to the north you are now by yourself standing in a dark room

01:47:26.580 --> 01:47:30.500

01:49:47.460 --> 01:49:53.380
frightening pastime remember that it's not your children's fault that they're being drawn into

01:49:53.380 --> 01:49:59.460
a satanic world of nightmare it's their gym teacher's fault for making them feel outcast

01:49:59.460 --> 01:50:08.340
when they couldn't do one single pull-up all true all of it yes 100 true including the pull-up

01:50:13.940 --> 01:50:17.780

01:58:07.620 --> 01:58:11.300
hear wow talk and you've never played you wish you could understand when you play or haven't

01:58:11.300 --> 01:58:16.740
played wow and you understand wow talk you wish you didn't understand define this is a good good

01:58:16.740 --> 01:58:26.820
question define what a raid is for our listeners alan a raid is content and challenges in the game

01:58:27.380 --> 01:58:32.340
that you need to coordinate a large number of players to cooperate in defeating those challenges

01:58:33.380 --> 01:58:36.980
and the rewards that you get are superior because of the people involved

01:58:36.980 --> 01:58:42.740
that good it's basically dnd for reals all right we're getting more phone calls let's i didn't even

01:58:42.740 --> 01:58:46.340
ask for calls it's just the phone is now ringing hi you're on orange on the radio who's this

01:58:47.220 --> 01:58:51.140

01:58:52.900 --> 01:59:00.740
oh not much just touching around virtual liberty city in gta balladegate tony now

01:59:00.740 --> 01:59:09.940
finally getting past that stupid chopper mission but um okay i don't know has anyone here played

01:59:09.940 --> 01:59:15.620
uh metal gear by chance no none of us in here have played oh no the truck have started to move

01:59:15.620 --> 01:59:22.420
the truck have started to move what are you talking to old school see the only metal gear

01:59:22.420 --> 01:59:28.340
language i speak is old school it's old school it's old school it's old school it's old school

01:59:28.340 --> 01:59:32.100
see the only metal gear language i speak is old school metal gear on the nes

01:59:34.500 --> 01:59:41.140
oh okay you guys played the playstation one no no no no no no no no no no those are good

01:59:41.140 --> 01:59:48.100
games too don't get me wrong metal gear solid is a solid series but you gotta go back let's see

01:59:48.100 --> 01:59:55.860
where it all began basically i'm stuck on the cycle mantis battle and that was the best battle

01:59:55.860 --> 02:00:03.940
made me almost want to crack my psp in half as we speak i see you are a careful man you save often

02:00:05.220 --> 02:00:10.740
you yeah you have to i don't know if it does this on the psp but it was so hardcore like that guy

02:00:10.740 --> 02:00:15.220
would read your memory card and like if you played other konami games he would freaking know

02:00:15.220 --> 02:00:19.300
and he'd be like yes oh you like to play castlevania do you and you'd be like oh my god

02:00:19.300 --> 02:00:29.300
oh my god because i have a castlevania save on there and a ddr save on there just for random

02:00:29.300 --> 02:00:35.700
point and let's just say here yeah you've read that and you're like rhythm fan or something

02:00:35.700 --> 02:00:41.780
around those lines but um on top of also anger management and gaming um and everything that

02:00:41.780 --> 02:00:48.580
almost made me want to break all my controllers and or system is guitar hero 3 the freaking devil

02:00:48.580 --> 02:00:55.220
i lost so many times on hard an expert to that guy what was that song guitar hero 3

02:00:55.220 --> 02:01:05.060
ready to pete counten my guitar um i i that song in guitar hero 3 that used to kill me

02:01:05.060 --> 02:01:11.460
was uh the muse song the night knights of sedonia like i probably broke my uh i probably like broke

02:01:11.460 --> 02:01:17.380
my guitar over that i don't know how many times oh my god but that's an epic song in itself it

02:01:17.380 --> 02:01:22.260
is a pretty epic song all right we gotta let you go please hurry up hurry up what's your last thought

02:01:23.540 --> 02:01:32.980
um oh god no oh right um i tried well the work effort tried to activate like a trial account

02:01:33.860 --> 02:01:39.700
and it won't work why not i got a little trial desk and everything it won't work what would you

02:01:39.700 --> 02:01:49.620
do oh wow and everything won't log me in it's stupid call blizzard technical support the trial

02:01:49.620 --> 02:01:54.420
accounts are so crippled because of people spammers use trial accounts so they can spam

02:01:54.420 --> 02:01:59.220
without having to pay so the accounts are so crippled like when i played with a trial account

02:01:59.220 --> 02:02:03.860
like two years ago i hated it because i couldn't do anything and then when i actually paid for it

02:02:03.860 --> 02:02:09.620
it's like oh this is a completely different game so is it worth it for the 15 bucks because i

02:02:09.620 --> 02:02:14.420
was in here in a whole lot i've known for your show but from every single last one of my friends

02:02:14.420 --> 02:02:21.860
who has it been bragging all about oh i got level 80 blah blah blah and i've rolled this character

02:02:22.420 --> 02:02:29.300
why aren't you playing i'm like uh i got a life and i play other games other than just

02:02:29.300 --> 02:02:34.180
one i can't can i say this here real quickly about warcraft the reason why i play so much

02:02:34.180 --> 02:02:38.660
warcraft is because the social element uh and you know a lot of my friends play and it's it's

02:02:38.660 --> 02:02:42.420
so much fun to like raid with them and stuff and it's always fun to like meet new people too that

02:02:42.420 --> 02:02:46.660
are that are like you and stuff first off two things apparently this has suddenly turned into

02:02:46.660 --> 02:02:51.220
the robin allen guild radio show because one of the guild members who i've never seen join chat

02:02:51.220 --> 02:02:58.580
before joined and said what do you mean allen has the best dps our bro joined and finally figured

02:02:58.580 --> 02:03:05.380
out because i've been watching the guild the whole web series and i've finally figured out the whole

02:03:05.380 --> 02:03:10.820
and some of the episodes and some of the lingo the thing is she really did play wow and that's

02:03:10.820 --> 02:03:16.740
why i like that series is so spot on because i'm sure it's a lot like some of it is probably like

02:03:16.740 --> 02:03:20.980
you know obviously fiction like some of the weird dating storylines to get into but a lot of the

02:03:20.980 --> 02:03:28.820
stuff they talk about in game is so true and then i just i just got yourself in the south park make

02:03:28.820 --> 02:03:35.700
laws not warcraft episode ma'am bathroom and this is uh i just got a screenshot from one of the

02:03:35.700 --> 02:03:42.500
guild members who apparently yes in guild chat at uh at 1 56 a.m i'm assuming that's eastern time

02:03:42.500 --> 02:03:45.860
uh one of the guildies said that bitch ain't coming to raid tomorrow because he's going to

02:03:45.860 --> 02:03:49.060
get pink berry that fat bitch i just got a screenshot of somebody talking shit about me

02:03:49.060 --> 02:03:55.140
and guild wow rob if it's one i know i know they're they're listening to if it's one something that

02:03:55.140 --> 02:04:01.060
would be central time actually one of my girlfriends ended up breaking up with me via wi-fi connection

02:04:01.060 --> 02:04:08.420
on a live metroid time hunters game where we could do voice chat we had friend codes everyone in the

02:04:08.420 --> 02:04:18.900
whole room heard it and then my character died i was just like wow um worst breakup ever i uh

02:04:18.900 --> 02:04:25.860
i whatever happened like a phone call like like text messages break up how how okay you have to

02:04:25.860 --> 02:04:32.500
explain that better like what what what did she do she she just came on the vo ip or whatever was

02:04:32.500 --> 02:04:37.940
like um i you know i i want to kill you a couple more times in metroid and by the way i hate you

02:04:37.940 --> 02:04:45.540
and i don't want to see you again basically it was because i was a gamer and so she she said

02:04:45.540 --> 02:04:51.540
she said either you quit gaming or i dumped you and get this this girl was a cheerleader and

02:04:51.540 --> 02:04:58.100
freshman and i was kind of done with my life trying to find love well you know what if i had

02:04:58.100 --> 02:05:01.700
the hot shirt cheerleaders you know what if there's one lesson we could teach you here on orange

02:05:01.700 --> 02:05:06.340
lingerie to look i want i want all the young men to listen up because i know we have you know some

02:05:06.340 --> 02:05:11.220
some strapping young lads that are what between like 16 and 21 that listen to the show young guys

02:05:11.220 --> 02:05:15.300
trying to like find the girl their dreams and so forth this is what i want to teach you and jay

02:05:15.300 --> 02:05:19.940
be back me up on this is that if a woman is going to break up with you because you play too many

02:05:19.940 --> 02:05:29.140
games she's a bitch yes she's a bitch and you can do better and that's just i'm dating a girl who

02:05:29.140 --> 02:05:34.500

all right all right buddy we're gonna let you go have a good one buddy all right later

02:05:39.460 --> 02:05:47.380
there's one thing you could learn from orange lounge real it's i i'm not saying if a girl

02:05:47.380 --> 02:05:51.700
doesn't play games she's a bitch that's that's that but if a girl doesn't understand you gotta

02:05:51.700 --> 02:06:01.620
respect the games she's a bitch i'm gonna get so much hate mail all right well i think i don't

02:06:01.620 --> 02:06:07.060
know if it's like honey get the keys the baby's coming now and it's like mister gut is at 20

02:10:29.940 --> 02:10:34.900
doing uh listless it's cheating though if i play too much music like playing about 10 minutes every

02:10:34.900 --> 02:10:38.340
hour that's that's okay because we needed to be able to take breaks and stuff but if i play much

02:10:38.340 --> 02:10:42.820
more than that we're cheating all right uh bradley hi we're going to be doing a listless here shortly

02:10:42.820 --> 02:10:46.420

02:11:14.020 --> 02:11:18.820
us what is our favorite video game of all time what about this uh john on facebook asked a very

02:11:18.820 --> 02:11:26.340
similar question not just what is the best video game ever what is the worst video game ever is

02:11:26.340 --> 02:11:32.180
there a game that you can think of that would qualify as the worst video game ever dark soccer

02:11:32.180 --> 02:11:38.420
there was a game that was so bad that when dan and i rented it we were horrified by it and called

02:11:38.420 --> 02:11:46.260
blockbuster and asked them if we could take it back and it was wcw thunder that bad huh it was

02:11:46.260 --> 02:11:52.580
really that bad and you know i actually kind of thought the spice girls game was bad but it's so

02:11:52.580 --> 02:11:59.860
hilarious it was hilarious come on kind of hard to play it was awesome and the american blue stinger

02:11:59.860 --> 02:12:06.020
was bad the japanese one was cool all right worst game ever alan you got something um

02:12:08.100 --> 02:12:13.380
probably that king's quest mask of eternity game because i bought it the day it came out for full

02:12:13.380 --> 02:12:20.820
retail prize which was like 50 bucks and it is hideously awful bad terra bad terra bad

02:12:22.980 --> 02:12:29.620
um i would uh what is the worst video game ever fusion frenzy 2 is probably the worst video game

02:12:30.420 --> 02:12:34.980
one of them it's close uh that was that one i made you play on the 360 that was so so bad like

02:12:34.980 --> 02:12:40.820
it was like mario party but not fun at all was like when you had me play yaris i couldn't help

02:12:40.820 --> 02:12:45.780
it because i was laughing i was just laughing just laughter came out of me playing yaris

02:12:45.780 --> 02:12:52.900
because it was so what is this i do not even so that's that's worth something um and and bit boy

02:12:52.900 --> 02:12:57.380
was really a special kind of terrible that i played earlier um this year too that was really

02:12:57.380 --> 02:13:03.620
bad or last year uh and um going like if i want to go way back okay i remember renting this game

02:13:03.620 --> 02:13:06.900
on the nintendo entertainment system and thinking it was just like the worst fucking game i'd ever

02:13:06.900 --> 02:13:11.300
played and i bet nobody's ever even heard of it it was a color dreams game okay they made

02:13:11.300 --> 02:13:16.740
they made the bootleg carts it was called master chew and the drunk nerd who and i remember this

02:13:16.740 --> 02:13:21.700
game because it was so terrible i bet that's a game not even jamie knows like that's how obscure

02:13:21.700 --> 02:13:27.380
this show huh no i've seen it have you it's bad it's bad it's really bad a lot of those color

02:13:27.380 --> 02:13:32.180
dreams were really bad yeah yeah good stuff bradley any terra bad games you can think of

02:13:32.180 --> 02:13:38.260
uh worst freaking video game uh the worst a lot of them that are really terrible are like these

02:13:38.260 --> 02:13:43.060
girl fighting games on like the japanese saturn ones i don't think like ask i don't know if it's

02:13:43.060 --> 02:13:48.820
like oscar 120 was actually fun i'm thinking of like one of them they might have been a different

02:13:48.820 --> 02:13:54.900
one from that one but usually they're slow and they make crappy moves and stuff uh with other

02:13:54.900 --> 02:14:02.580
games were craptastic let's see some of our uh chat room uh saying uh ddr dollar bill says silent

02:14:02.580 --> 02:14:07.380
assault was another color dreams game that was worse green dragon says princess tomato in the

02:14:07.380 --> 02:14:11.700
salad kingdom the forest you had to get through was a bigger pain in the ass than the doom dungeon

02:14:12.260 --> 02:14:21.380
uh let's see uh dash of destruction yaris kabuki warriors says amaze satsuma was a really bad game

02:14:21.380 --> 02:14:28.420
sir dorks a lot says the ps1 version of samurai showdown 3 was terrible there you go those are

02:14:28.420 --> 02:14:35.780
some of the responses there from our chat room more facebook questions uh john on facebook also

02:14:35.780 --> 02:14:43.940
asks the the best geek moment ever this is a good one the best geek moment ever what was your like

02:14:43.940 --> 02:14:51.140
best geek moment ever this is kind of tricky oh mine's easy that's uh beating the dragon blindfold

02:14:51.140 --> 02:14:59.140
did in mega man 2 that is pretty geeky and and uh doing you know doing mario ate one blindfolded

02:14:59.780 --> 02:15:07.060
if if you know your rhythm it's not that hard but the dragon because and that one was also

02:15:07.060 --> 02:15:16.260
kind of precise timing too so i i've only done it three times nice i can't do it now hell no

02:15:16.260 --> 02:15:22.820
but when when it was out yeah okay all right alan do you have a best geek moment ever that you can

02:15:22.820 --> 02:15:29.700
think of not right now all right now i would say mine was probably my first e3 walking through the

02:15:29.700 --> 02:15:34.580
doors of my first e3 it was kind of like oh this is what i've read about in gaming magazines for

02:15:34.580 --> 02:15:39.780
so long and i'm actually here and oh my god and then i realized everything was really overpriced

02:15:39.780 --> 02:15:45.620
and all the lines were long but it was still a pretty cool experience um i thought though

02:15:45.620 --> 02:15:49.780
this year's e3 was like a close second you know you're my first e3 was definitely my best but

02:15:49.780 --> 02:15:53.940
this year's e3 was a close second this is a really good e3 this year so what about though

02:15:53.940 --> 02:15:59.460
going to e3 for the first time is press um that was cool too but i honestly didn't notice that

02:15:59.460 --> 02:16:02.900
huge of a difference because one thing i've learned about press is that if you don't book

02:16:02.900 --> 02:16:06.740
your show like six months in advance then you're pretty much having the same show as everyone else

02:16:07.780 --> 02:16:13.700
plus back in oh six or oh seven i don't remember what year we actually went as press maybe it was

02:16:13.700 --> 02:16:17.940
oh seven i booked us with bethesda well in advance so we could get in for the star trek screening

02:16:17.940 --> 02:16:22.580
yeah which ended up being a mediocre game which was too bad yeah and i got into though i got him

02:16:22.580 --> 02:16:27.940
one time as not as pressed though for a press thing for public cross no i'm sorry for to steal

02:16:27.940 --> 02:16:32.660
your thunder oh that's okay but it was it was good um yeah there were some really good parties

02:16:32.660 --> 02:16:37.380
depending on uh what year it was you know uh looking in our chat room and some of the questions

02:16:37.380 --> 02:16:42.660
uh questions here uh jv mon says my best geek moment was meeting matt smith at the new york

02:16:42.660 --> 02:16:47.380
city premiere of doctor who series 5 and being on the 13th episode of doctor who confidential

02:16:48.580 --> 02:16:54.660
uh rama says beating mega man 3 dan shadow says the parties at e3 were insane yep yep

02:16:55.700 --> 02:17:00.980
what was that place that we went and got beer at they had like 200 anywhere 200 taps on the

02:17:00.980 --> 02:17:06.180
wall or something like that that place was oh seattle those packs for packs that was epic yes

02:17:06.180 --> 02:17:11.060
maybe some people are there right now although you know i did enjoy my uh my facebook style photo

02:17:11.060 --> 02:17:23.620
with jonathan colton that was pretty fun all right um i've got one oh yes uh at anime expo

02:17:23.620 --> 02:17:29.540
2000 this is like jamie says you must remember seeing me there it was that was my last day x

02:17:29.540 --> 02:17:35.380
yeah yeah uh actually stayed up all night uh at the ddr room i didn't i think i only played it

02:17:35.380 --> 02:17:39.060
once there but i was just they were watching people because i was waiting for that there's

02:17:39.060 --> 02:17:43.380
like they were having like signings in the morning at disneyland wasn't it was it 2001

02:17:43.380 --> 02:17:47.700
at disneyland because then i was there for one after that uh can't remember if that was a long

02:17:47.700 --> 02:17:53.620
beach winner in disneyland one it wasn't no it hadn't been long beach no no the 2000 was the one

02:17:53.620 --> 02:18:00.100
at disneyland 2001 was yeah it was at an aheim okay it was one with like a long pier down there

02:18:00.100 --> 02:18:04.580
we went down there and waited yeah so yeah basically stay up all night watching people play

02:18:04.580 --> 02:18:10.980
ddr waiting to get signatures from like artists and stuff that's pretty geeky staying up all

02:18:10.980 --> 02:18:16.980
night to play ddr that was a day charging two dollars a play on a third mix i mostly was just

02:18:16.980 --> 02:18:21.860
watching because i only played like once because that was the first time i'd ever seen it so it

02:18:21.860 --> 02:18:27.700
was just kind of interesting to watch then then once i found the ddr usa and at roseville golf

02:18:27.700 --> 02:18:33.300
land then and then i the obsession began that was the year of the chair here's some more geek

02:18:33.300 --> 02:18:37.620
moments from chat green dragon says biggest geek moment speaking cling on with my dad

02:18:37.620 --> 02:18:45.060
dude your dad is cool uh let's see uh gilroy spars which i think is nathan says uh being told about

02:18:45.060 --> 02:18:49.700
a weekend cabin retreat of drinking and massive dnd playing and being very excited about going

02:18:49.700 --> 02:18:53.380
that does sound kind of awesome but you have to actually go for it to be a geek moment just you

02:18:53.380 --> 02:19:00.580
know uh ben jamus a friend of mine irl who's listening says meeting robocop at an la kings

02:19:00.580 --> 02:19:06.420
game so by the way actually my friend ben is is also jewish dark sakura and i'm supposed to tell

02:19:06.420 --> 02:19:11.860
you la shana tova is that that that pretty much means have a good year because russia shana is

02:19:11.860 --> 02:19:17.300
this uh oh there you go wednesday night slash thursday during the day i got it's like i'm i'm

02:19:17.300 --> 02:19:22.580
like the translator of like jew speak tonight or something i don't know it's just hebrew rob

02:19:22.580 --> 02:19:28.100
i thought of my geek moment you thought of your geek moment yay um when i was in dmla which was

02:19:28.100 --> 02:19:34.180
the youth group that i was in uh oh boy we went all right i'm gonna out myself i was in it too

02:19:34.180 --> 02:19:37.940
and the reason i haven't talked about a lot of the show because not a lot of kids were in it

02:19:37.940 --> 02:19:42.820
like it's not it's it's youth masonry right so it's like not a lot of the masons before their

02:19:42.820 --> 02:19:47.140
son usually if your grandpa's in it or you're like in my case you end up being in it you have friends

02:19:47.140 --> 02:19:52.340
that were in it or what have you but um the the reason why i bring this up before he he says this

02:19:52.340 --> 02:19:57.540
is um because alan and i were both in this organization so we're convinced that we met

02:19:57.540 --> 02:20:02.580
each other when we were 15 like at camp at the leadership camp or whatever like we're convinced

02:20:02.580 --> 02:20:09.540
we met each other and just didn't like you know we weren't really like neither of us were practicing

02:20:09.540 --> 02:20:13.940
homosexuals at the time and yeah so you know just it was i was like i know i was like magically

02:20:13.940 --> 02:20:18.020
gathering cards exactly yeah me too i'd be like let's talk about new super nintendo which is

02:20:18.020 --> 02:20:21.700
weird that we wouldn't have met because we would have had all those same interests like now going

02:20:21.700 --> 02:20:26.340
but it's just weird i don't know so at the convention which is basically like four days

02:20:26.340 --> 02:20:30.900
of a bunch of 15 year old boys just staying up and doing convention things i think we hooked up a

02:20:31.620 --> 02:20:37.380
super ness up to our hotel route tv room and we played i think we played rock and roll racing

02:20:37.380 --> 02:20:44.340
and street fighter 2 i think for like 36 hours without sleeping oh my god which is something

02:20:44.340 --> 02:20:53.300
that you can only do when you're 15 i beg to differ oh i beg to differ okay when i it was

02:20:53.300 --> 02:20:58.740
probably my i'd have to say my second year of college or my first year somewhere around there

02:20:58.740 --> 02:21:02.980
i was working in the game room and so i brought in my tv and my super nintendo and my friend

02:21:02.980 --> 02:21:09.700
brought in his import saturn and we had gaming going on in the pool hall all night and i ran dnd

02:21:09.700 --> 02:21:14.340
games and we did this three nights in a row and i did not sleep and on the fourth day of having

02:21:14.340 --> 02:21:20.660
been awake i was i sit down at my friend's dorm room and lean back on the cushions while they're

02:21:20.660 --> 02:21:27.940
playing um whatever i think it was doom at the time and wake up in my own dorm bed oh so they

02:21:27.940 --> 02:21:34.740
carried you they carried me to my dorm room don't remember any of it don't remember but i'm sorry

02:21:34.740 --> 02:21:39.540
but the best like dorm slash frat house story that you possibly have was when you missed this show

02:21:39.540 --> 02:21:44.020
because you were in san diego one weekend and you stayed at the gay frat house can you tell this

02:21:44.020 --> 02:21:50.980
story again on the show real quick right it's been years i um i went with julie to uh san diego to

02:21:50.980 --> 02:21:56.180
see um some friends of ours um who one of them lives in japan right now and the other one lives

02:21:56.180 --> 02:22:01.700
somewhere in town i think now he moved up here he used to be julie's roommate for a while anyway um

02:22:02.900 --> 02:22:09.460
we uh there was like hardly anywhere else to stay and so the only place i got to stay was this

02:22:09.460 --> 02:22:16.260
little cot under the stairs it was a little room how did you end up going to a gay frat house as

02:22:16.260 --> 02:22:21.620
your hotel because the only place that we had to stay was the gay frat house to stay with our

02:22:21.620 --> 02:22:26.580
friends oh your friend was a gay frat boy yeah okay he lived in the frat house okay so the only

02:22:26.580 --> 02:22:32.580
spaces like julie slept on i think on some couch and i slept in a little room under the stairs

02:22:32.580 --> 02:22:37.220
where there had been a mattress it's like the harry potter room we caught that's what he called

02:22:37.220 --> 02:22:41.780
it the harry potter room and so it had like a little light in there all on its own and

02:22:41.780 --> 02:22:46.260
everything it was actually kind of neat um i'm very very glad they washed the mattress before

02:22:46.260 --> 02:22:49.780
i used it i know i was just like think about all the hand jobs have taken place in that little

02:22:49.780 --> 02:22:54.580
closet all right bro i'm so drunk bro bro where are we at bro

02:22:58.100 --> 02:23:04.500
sorry but it was it was a fun visit though because we went to extraordinary dessert which is this

02:23:04.500 --> 02:23:14.020
gourmet dessert shop in san francisco and like amazing stuff and um went to uh julie in california

02:23:14.020 --> 02:23:19.620
up in the mountains um kind of a little touristy town but it was the first place i ever had buffalo

02:23:19.620 --> 02:23:26.660
burgers and i came back on i slept in the harry potter room rob i read harry potter in the harry

02:23:26.660 --> 02:23:34.500
potter room and i was like wait there's gay frat houses like i didn't even know there's like a

02:23:34.500 --> 02:23:38.740
gay fraternity no i know that now but like 10 years ago i didn't remember however long ago that

02:23:38.740 --> 02:23:46.500
was all right all that long time ago oh no it's been a long time all right uh redertainment is

02:23:46.500 --> 02:23:54.580
falling up saying bro don't stop doing that i need to get something else to drink all right

02:23:54.580 --> 02:24:01.540
um let's see should we move on to another question here uh yes uh another question from john on

02:24:01.540 --> 02:24:10.580
facebook says the best and worst game tie-ins i.e movies tv so forth although i guess i could

02:24:10.580 --> 02:24:17.220
go on to like action figures and all that good stuff so the best and the worst tie-ins um

02:24:18.340 --> 02:24:22.260
i think honestly the best as far as like movies and all that go the silent hill movie was pretty

02:24:22.260 --> 02:24:27.220
kick-ass like it's even though it wasn't like perfect it was still like miles above anything

02:24:27.220 --> 02:24:31.540
else i think has come out to this point so um the silent hill movie is probably one of the best

02:24:32.100 --> 02:24:38.900
um as far as the worst that maniac mansion shows up there that's that was pretty bad or um

02:24:38.900 --> 02:24:43.140
maybe the pac-man cartoon in the 80s was was not that great either like it really didn't

02:24:43.860 --> 02:24:48.340
i don't know it didn't didn't work for me i don't know the best and the worst video game

02:24:48.340 --> 02:24:54.340
tie-ins dark sakura like movie tv best was silent hill i have to agree with you there and you know

02:24:54.340 --> 02:24:57.220
how many times i've watched it and i bought it on blu-ray because i'm a fucking addict

02:24:58.180 --> 02:25:08.500
saw it four times in the theater um worst captain n because the characterizations in that were just

02:25:08.500 --> 02:25:17.780
so awful they were hideous and um i also have to say the the street fighter movie with john

02:25:17.780 --> 02:25:23.700
claudia van damme poor ral julia having that this is last movie but kali minnow was hot

02:25:28.500 --> 02:25:36.260

02:26:33.380 --> 02:26:37.860
i don't know if you have anything you're thinking of best and worst video game tie-ins can't really

02:26:37.860 --> 02:26:45.540
think anything any and all of the marketing related to dante's inferno last year oh that

02:26:45.540 --> 02:26:51.220
whole debacle tie-ins ever oh what was so terrible about it like see what you can get away with with

02:26:51.220 --> 02:26:58.420
a booth babe or like or maybe tied for god of war 2 when they served like a goat or something at the

02:26:58.420 --> 02:27:02.820
press conference and they have the girls in the togas of course it was a fake animal right but

02:27:02.820 --> 02:27:07.700
they're like oh yeah we have a dead goat for god of war 2 no that's dumb and you're a bad person

02:27:07.700 --> 02:27:14.340
for thinking of it yeah sony just in general has a lot of really bad tie-ins like sometimes they do

02:27:14.340 --> 02:27:17.780
really well like the kevin butler stuff but sometimes they do really bad like remember the

02:27:17.780 --> 02:27:23.060
black and white psp oh yeah oh that was not not good like you just feel secondhand embarrassment

02:27:23.060 --> 02:27:30.340

that's where we're going to make the definitive list about a particular topic let me re-explain

02:27:46.580 --> 02:27:51.140
the way this works if you've never heard listless before because somehow it's almost midnight and

02:27:51.140 --> 02:27:57.460
there's still almost 100 of you listening so you're up very late so the way this works

02:27:57.460 --> 02:28:01.220
we're going to put together a definitive list we're going to go around and get the top three

02:28:01.220 --> 02:28:06.740
answers on the list from each person here in studio so we have a top 12 but then we go around

02:28:06.740 --> 02:28:12.340
the room and ask which of these is not worthy of the list and we reduce down to the top eight

02:28:12.340 --> 02:28:17.860
which then you our chat room vote and we'll uh come up with the definitive list and tonight we've

02:28:17.860 --> 02:28:26.420

02:55:12.420 --> 02:55:15.940
there you go i brought a bunch of psp and ds games that are still in the car

02:55:15.940 --> 02:55:18.740
did you because i didn't know what we were gonna do today i i didn't either

02:55:19.940 --> 02:55:24.660
i i just showed up they're still in the car hi you're on orange lounge radio who's this

02:55:24.660 --> 02:55:32.020
hey hello hello hey this is the ddr dollar bill ddr dollar bill what's up $50 bill

02:55:33.860 --> 02:55:40.020
nothing much it's like three of them half a loopy so join the club you'll be a perfect

02:55:40.020 --> 02:55:45.380
fit for our show what's on your mind buddy not much i was wanting to call earlier i think uh

02:55:45.380 --> 02:55:50.420
zacker said about uh going older and not playing games too much and ddr just fading out

02:55:50.420 --> 02:55:55.060
man i took care of that i mean there's like there's next to no places to play the art anymore

02:55:55.060 --> 02:55:59.380
and even i stopped playing and i just got i didn't get bored of it i just got tired of all

02:55:59.380 --> 02:56:04.740
these new kids coming around causing crap and everything you know it it stopped becoming fun

02:56:04.740 --> 02:56:09.780
i'm interested in some of this resurgence that's coming up namely dance central and dance masters

02:56:09.780 --> 02:56:13.060
and part of the reason that interests me is because it's very different like it's a whole

02:56:13.060 --> 02:56:17.380
new way to kind of play a dance game it's not just stomping on a mat and the song list for dance

02:56:17.380 --> 02:56:21.380
central like i love the fact that both these games exist because there's truly something

02:56:21.380 --> 02:56:26.180
for everyone there's dance central for those folks that really want something in the mainstream and

02:56:26.180 --> 02:56:30.580
like their you know music to be in the mainstream and top 40 and then for folks that have really

02:56:30.580 --> 02:56:34.980
grown up on the you know bamani hits from japan there's dance masters i really think there's

02:56:34.980 --> 02:56:38.900
something for everyone on connect and i it's kind of exciting where that that's going and it almost

02:56:38.900 --> 02:56:45.620
makes me like excited about music games again is that game ddr no but you know ddr is a great

02:56:45.620 --> 02:56:53.380
no but you know ddr has been around since 1998 it's it's it's been an epically long series it's

02:56:53.380 --> 02:56:58.500
it's okay for it to be dying out right about now you know i'm not disagreeing with that i you know

02:56:58.500 --> 02:57:03.780
i don't mind it dying out because it's you know forever but my only thing with the two dance games

02:57:03.780 --> 02:57:08.660
that i was thinking about when i actually saw it was one both of them i would actually like

02:57:08.660 --> 02:57:13.860
to see something where you can make your own choreography not just follow what they have

02:57:13.860 --> 02:57:20.020
on screen like everything seems to be set to so you pick one song you follow that choreography

02:57:20.020 --> 02:57:26.340
for that song and never changes and i kind of want to see because they have it's the way it

02:57:26.340 --> 02:57:32.180
looks like it's that they're broken to sections so you have a four four beat for one step maybe two

02:57:32.180 --> 02:57:35.780
two beats for another step you know you kind of like put it together the way it looks in the

02:57:35.780 --> 02:57:41.300
commercials you know versus us whatever and the way i'm thinking is if there is some way maybe

02:57:41.300 --> 02:57:46.100
to shuffle something around so you can kind of make your own choreography to the song your own

02:57:46.100 --> 02:57:50.980
version to it i mean that's one way i'm thinking it would actually make the game a little better

02:57:50.980 --> 02:57:58.580
because otherwise i mean i could see being good but at the same time i don't know it just seems

02:57:58.580 --> 02:58:03.300
it just seems kind of too limited i honestly honestly think that dance masters is the future

02:58:03.300 --> 02:58:07.860
of ddr like i think that's where konami's put in their stock is this whole connect thing and if it

02:58:07.860 --> 02:58:13.620
takes off you're going to see something like it in arcades too man i hope so i mean if they fix

02:58:13.620 --> 02:58:19.300
the lag and connect in the connect yeah this will definitely take off like crazy and i can even see

02:58:19.300 --> 02:58:23.620
dance schools utilizing this we'll see all right buddy i'm going to let you go to get some more

02:58:23.620 --> 02:58:27.700

03:25:14.420 --> 03:25:19.540
plug music brains picard because the program will analyze your mp3 files and attempt to tag them

03:25:19.540 --> 03:25:25.380
with the correct title artist and album works even for my mislabeled pop and music albums it's insane

03:25:25.380 --> 03:25:30.980

03:25:38.660 --> 03:25:42.980
retentive about their mp3 collection would be alan so would you ever subject your mp3 collection to

03:25:42.980 --> 03:25:50.980
a program like this i'm too ocd to let anything automated affect my mp3 tags yeah i i you would

03:25:50.980 --> 03:25:56.420
like i could see that it would like put the space in the wrong place and you'd just be like no

03:25:56.420 --> 03:26:04.340
oh yeah if it if it took all of my compilations and unchecked the compilation tag and like a batch

03:26:04.340 --> 03:26:10.020
process i would i would die it'd be over yeah what's ever going to happen if that drive died

03:26:10.020 --> 03:26:15.540
do you have a backup somehow or what's going to happen a tape backup somehow so far my music
