0	19320	Today, September 5th, 2010, the 360 is set to get a new controller.
19320	23720	News from PAX includes the return of a long forgotten game franchise, and could comic
23720	32280	books be coming to the PS3?
32280	36960	Hello everybody out there on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge
36960	37960	Radio.
37960	43880	We are that show where every gamer has a voice, and joining you over the next several, many,
43880	45160	long hours.
45160	49240	My name is Rob Roberts, sometimes going by Skye in our chatroom and so forth.
49240	52840	Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
52840	53840	Hi.
53840	54840	How are you?
54840	56440	I'm on podcast number two for the day.
56440	58040	I know, yes.
58040	61480	You're having quite the podcasting day, but we'll get to that in a minute.
61480	65200	But we also have to introduce the one and only tech master, Loki.
65200	66200	Hello.
66200	67200	How are you?
67200	68200	I'm good.
68200	70200	I made an observation this morning, I was trying to confirm.
70200	71960	What is that?
71960	76300	I don't know if anybody remembers the guy, Reginald Vell-Johnson.
76300	77300	You may remember him.
77300	78300	Was he the dad on Family Matters?
78300	79560	He was the dad on Family Matters.
79560	80560	Oh!
80560	83080	Dude, I'm a pop culture sponge!
83080	88120	Anyways, I was watching Ghostbusters today because they were playing it on Comedy Central,
88120	89120	and he was a cop in that.
89120	93760	I'm like, how many fucking movies and shows has he been a damn police officer in?
93760	97320	Because he's always a goddamn police officer in everything.
97320	98880	Quite a few, actually.
98880	103320	Die Hard 1, Die Hard 2, and Ghostbusters, as well as Family Matters.
103320	107720	And of course I'd have to go through the rest of these to figure out which ones of these
107720	111000	he's actually a police officer, but it just has his name on there.
111000	112000	But it's just weird.
112000	113000	Orange Round Studio.
113000	114000	Talk about...
114000	115000	I know, what has he done lately?
115000	118360	Can we get him on the show, maybe, to do some voiceovers?
118360	121440	He was also in Die Hard Vendetta, the video game, as his character.
121440	122440	Oh, hey!
122440	123440	Oh, bringing it back to games.
123440	124440	There you go.
124440	125440	Love it.
125440	126440	Alright.
126440	127440	Over the next many hours, we are going to be talking about video games.
127440	131880	Look, it is a, if you haven't heard, it's a special episode today, tonight, and so forth.
131880	135700	We decided that, and I don't know why we decided this, it was really just one of those kind
135700	139520	of random things, because we like to do that around here, that we're going to broadcast
139520	141520	as long as we can today.
141520	144440	We're actually having an early start, so we are live at All Games Radio.
144440	149280	We do tape live every Sunday at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, right after the Bobby
149280	151000	Black Wolf show, usually.
151000	154560	But today it's 2 o'clock Pacific, 5 o'clock Eastern, and we're starting to show a little
154560	155880	bit early, because the plan is...
155880	157020	It's 10 o'clock in England.
157020	158680	We're going to go, yeah, 10 at night.
158680	161960	So finally we're getting kind of an earlier show in for them, so I hope some folks overseas
161960	163680	are listening too.
163680	167120	But we're going to actually try to go late tonight.
167120	168380	I don't know how late.
168380	170680	The goal is midnight.
170680	172120	We might go longer.
172120	173600	We might go not as long.
173600	175660	I don't know, but we'll see.
175660	177480	So we're doing the marathon episode.
177480	178480	Why?
178480	179480	Because we can.
179480	180900	Why not?
180900	182920	It's not, it's not a fundraiser for anything.
182920	186920	I mean, you should donate to charities, you know, do good in your life, that, but we're
186920	191320	just doing this for fun, because everybody else is at some freaking convention this weekend,
191320	194480	so we're having a little mini festival of our own.
194480	197440	We do have some guests joining us in the studio here today.
197440	199160	I don't know how long they'll be with us.
199160	200780	I think he'll be with us the whole time.
200780	203760	Say hello to Salacious Pop or Alan.
203760	204760	Hello.
204760	205760	How are you?
205760	206760	Much better than last time.
206760	207760	Really?
207760	208760	What was wrong last time?
208760	209760	I had food poisoning when I was on the show.
209760	210760	Oh, that's right.
210760	212400	You were recovering from the Reno trip.
212400	213400	Yes.
213400	214400	But you're feeling much better today.
214400	215400	Yes.
215400	216400	All right.
216400	217960	Yeah, I was a little worried about that, because we're doing this marathon today.
217960	220040	We didn't really plan it out very well.
220040	222880	It's just like, hey, let's broadcast for 12 hours.
222880	223880	Okay.
223880	226680	You know, oh, when are we going to eat?
226680	227680	So I don't know.
227680	230100	Hopefully Dan is going to be back at some point where we'll be able to kind of rotate
230100	231100	in and out.
231100	234840	So learn with us here at Orange Lounge Radio tonight.
234840	235960	Just order a pizza.
235960	237640	Just put the pizza guy on the show.
237640	238640	So talk about games.
238640	241640	And he's like, I'm going to get fired.
241640	242640	Yeah.
242640	243640	You know what?
243640	247600	If it wasn't that Dan couldn't have the sodium, we could totally just do a take and bake.
247600	249560	Send Dan off to be our errand boy.
249560	250560	Good times.
250560	251560	Get a Papa Murphy's.
251560	252560	Good times.
252560	256440	Also joining us, say hello to Bradley, our KDN 42.
256440	257520	You said there'd be surprises.
257520	258520	I'm the first one.
258520	259520	All right.
259520	260520	How are you?
260520	263880	You were on the show a couple months ago, but then like before that, you weren't on
263880	264880	for like a couple years.
264880	265880	I was on a few months ago.
265880	266880	I don't remember.
266880	267880	I thought you were.
267880	268880	Oh, well.
268880	272520	I think the last time I was on was at your house that you were at.
272520	273520	Oh, that was a while ago.
273520	274520	I thought for some reason.
274520	275520	Oh, well.
275520	276520	Whatever.
276520	278520	I think you maybe mentioned me, because I was here for her party or something before
278520	279520	that.
279520	280520	That might have been it.
280520	281520	That might have been it.
281520	282800	And then I popped in the chat room like once or twice.
282800	283800	There you go.
283800	284800	Well, what's new with Bradley?
284800	285800	What are you up to?
285800	289600	Well, I hadn't been playing any games since last week, because I was on the road.
289600	292440	I did like a seven-day trip of national parks.
292440	293440	You do a lot of that.
293440	297080	You do a lot of like, I'm just going to get my car and drive until I run out of gas type
297080	298080	of thing.
298080	299080	Yeah.
299080	300080	Right?
300080	301080	So what are some of the like awesome places you've been to?
301080	305600	I went to Yellowstone, and then I went after that was also Grand Teton, because you have
305600	310180	to go through that if you're in one of the directions.
310180	314800	Then the next one was Theodore Roosevelt, which I just kind of drove around.
314800	321240	And also the next day was Rocky Mountain, where you go up like 12,000 feet when driving.
321240	327840	Then Arches, which have all the natural arches in it, and Canyonlands, which is a big canyon.
327840	334160	Also was, what's the next one after that, was Coral Reef, or Capitol Reef.
334160	336800	Bradley, I'm thinking you should just be a park ranger.
336800	339160	Like can't you see Bradley is a park ranger?
339160	340280	Like I could totally see that.
340280	344280	He'd just be in his cabin during the winters with the Xbox, and what have you.
344280	345280	Good time.
345280	349280	Actually, now, let me give a little background on Orange L'Angereo.
349280	352680	Since we have a lot of extra time today, I can kind of do that for the people who haven't
352680	356640	listened in a very, or who are just now listening, or you haven't heard this story because you
356640	358360	haven't told it in a long time.
358360	361160	Here's what Orange L'Angereo is all about.
361160	365080	We've been broadcasting for about eight years, right?
365080	366080	Over eight years?
366080	367080	I lost count at some point.
367080	371280	It's almost coming up on nine years, but we've been broadcasting about eight years.
371280	375600	Dark Soccer, myself, and Loki all met at a local arcade, and actually Bradley was a part
375600	378440	of this too, all playing Dance Dance Revolution.
378440	382180	We all just got sucked into this game, and it was this whole little like culture and
382180	387560	scene for a time, and there were websites that just got so much traffic when these games
387560	390960	were really at their peak, at least as far as I can tell.
390960	394480	Things like DDR Freak and Spot and so forth.
394480	399760	DDR's still around, but the culture isn't quite the same as it used to be back in my
399760	405200	day, but we decided to start a show about DDR and Dance Dance Revolution and that whole
405200	408300	scene, and that's the way the show was for about the first, what, about three, four years
408300	409300	we were doing that?
409300	412100	Then when podcasting came around, we got into doing that.
412100	413320	We used to do a spinoff show.
413320	418800	It was a spinoff show of our main show about just video games in general, and then that
418800	424320	kind of took off and ended up kind of taking over the DDR part when music games and so
424320	432600	forth were not so popular anymore, so we kind of just built this show around a community,
432600	436500	and that is really what our show is all about at the end of the day, is that after these
436500	442120	long DDR nights at Golfland or wherever we were at, we would go have dinner at a local
442120	446000	restaurant and just talk smack about video games and sometimes each other, so that's
446000	448500	kind of what we tried to bring to the show here.
448500	451200	We like to call ourselves the show where every gamer has a voice.
451200	456320	Since the very beginning, we've always tried to incorporate chat, and this is before podcasting
456320	457520	was really huge.
457520	459600	We tried to incorporate all of this into our show.
459600	463560	I like to think we were one of the first shows that did take calls over Skype, and it's kind
463560	467840	of interesting now that that is the way a lot of podcasts do their whole shows now is
467840	471040	over Skype, so it was kind of neat to be... I don't know if we were the first.
471040	474800	We were definitely one of the first to do that, so that was kind of cool to be on the
474800	475800	cutting edge of that.
475800	479680	So we try to get on the Twitters and the Facebooks and chat and all the ways that you guys can
479680	482200	interact with us, and give us your opinion.
482200	485060	It's because we're technologically able.
485060	486160	We have the technology.
486160	488320	We can repair something.
488320	489320	Something something.
489320	490320	All right.
490320	493160	So anyway, the reason why I give that background is that we all kind of bring different things
493160	494160	to the table.
494160	496800	We all like different types of games.
496800	500300	For instance, Dark Sakura, she does the classic game of the week here on the show every week
500300	507240	because she has a vast brain full of useless video game trivia and these obscure ass import
507240	512880	games, even I don't hear of ever, so that's kind of her background, right?
512880	514840	Is that the kind of fair assessment?
514840	515840	Yeah.
515840	516840	Yeah.
516840	519800	And then Loki... Speaking of random trivia, he has been in
519800	525640	nine different shows or series playing a law enforcement officer.
525640	530280	Granted, the one in Ghostbusters, he was a prison guard, but God damn it, that's close
530280	531280	enough.
531280	534940	So, nine different series or movies or...
534940	538480	Don't you have to be an officer to be a prison guard?
538480	541560	It's still a law enforcement job, so... But yeah, that's a lot.
541560	544360	He's just really typecast, so... Anyways, enough talking about him.
544360	545920	I'm not going to talk about him anymore.
545920	546920	Promise?
546920	547920	Promise.
547920	548920	You're going to have a good 12 hours to do so.
548920	550480	I know you're not staying the whole time, but all right.
550480	555160	Anyway, Loki is kind of... I see him as more of like our tech hack crack.
555160	557980	If there's a way to break the game, he will kind of guy.
557980	561320	He was the guy that probably bought a game genie as soon as they were out to see how
561320	562600	he could screw up the game.
562600	564160	I bought one, though.
564160	567080	Would that be kind of a fair assessment of what you're all about?
567080	568080	Sure.
568080	569080	All right.
569080	570080	And then me, I don't know.
570080	573680	I grew up on Commodore 64 and all the old school games, so I like to think of myself
573680	576920	as kind of like a retro-y gamer as well, but I like a lot of new stuff, too.
576920	578560	I think lately it's been MMOs.
578560	581920	I've played a lot of them, and a lot of computer games, too.
581920	586820	I mean, not all of them, but I try to do them, so I'm just kind of a little bit of everything.
586820	591300	And then the reason why I kind of lay all that out is I want to ask Bradley, what types
591300	595280	of games do you bring... What's your gaming background?
595280	598360	What do you like, what are your likes and dislikes in gaming?
598360	601800	Generally, I play a lot... Most types of games, other than that, maybe sports.
601800	602800	I don't really play sports all that much.
602800	605360	I play them a little bit, but not that much.
605360	611960	I play mostly puzzle games, played RPGs, I used to play those a lot more than I do now
611960	615440	just because I don't have the time to play a long form like that.
615440	619440	Adventure games, and so on.
619440	622760	Cool deal, cool deal.
622760	627960	I always think it's a bad idea when people go around saying, I hate all sports games,
627960	629520	or I hate sports video games.
629520	631320	Sports video games are crap.
631320	635180	A lot of people on this show, it may not be the preference of the types of games we play
635180	639360	most of the time, but I think it would be a lie to say I hate all sports games, because
639360	643160	I love NBA Jam, and I love that it's coming back as an awesome game.
643160	646040	I have a way to make it very nice and simple for you.
646040	650200	It's just like racing games, how you have your arcade racing games, which are fun to
650200	655600	play, and your simulation racing games, which require you to be able to drive and tune a
655600	659820	car with the same precision that you would a real car.
659820	662000	You hate simulation sports games.
662000	665520	You do arcade style sports games, though.
665520	669860	That actually makes a lot of sense, because... And then over there, those folks, usually
669860	672960	it's like, oh, well, I hate all those Japanese RPGs.
672960	678440	There's too much of the same stuff, but maybe I'll play Final Fantasy.
678440	683720	I'll play that one that is kind of out in the mainstream, or music games.
683720	686840	A lot of people are like, that arrow stomping, no, what is that?
686840	688920	That Japanese ravy techno music?
688920	689920	What is that?
689920	690920	What is that?
690920	692480	And I sort of see that as the hardcore music games.
692480	698480	BeatMania 2DX is a hardcore music game, but I'm sure everybody has enjoyed Guitar Hero
698480	699480	at least once.
699480	701720	A rock band, at a party, drunk.
701720	703400	So it's kind of interesting.
703400	704400	This ties into an email.
704400	705960	I don't recommend DDR drunk.
705960	707360	Well, it can be fun.
707360	709160	Until you hit your head.
709160	710160	Responsibly.
710160	713680	We had an email on the show last week that kind of got me thinking about all this, was
713680	718280	the whole, my friend says I'm not a gamer because I don't play X, Y, and Z. Remember
718280	719280	that?
719280	724080	I've been thinking about that email a lot this week, and just like, A, where does your
724080	725640	friend get off telling you that?
725640	726640	Anyway.
726640	727640	All right.
727640	729280	Yeah, well, your friend's a butt.
729280	732200	Let's get into how we always like to start off the show here at Orange Lounge Radio even
732200	734080	though we're, what, like 12 minutes in now.
734080	735580	How was your gaming week?
735580	737760	What kind of video games have you been playing this week, and how were they?
737760	739680	Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week?
739680	744040	It was kind of not, because I've, it's been a busy week for me.
744040	752800	I had school, and I had my visit to the mikvah on Thursday.
752800	753960	My conversion went through.
753960	757760	I am now the official Jew of Orange Lounge Radio.
757760	758760	Congrats!
758760	765680	Although, SSJ100Matt is probably very upset about his title being stripped, and his tiara.
765680	767320	I'm the host.
767320	771200	Okay, you guys can also be, you can be the official co-Jews.
771200	775920	Yes, they can be your, like, it's his yarmulke being stripped.
775920	776920	They can be your harem of Jews.
776920	777920	I don't know what you would call that.
777920	778920	They can be my posse.
778920	781360	All right, your posse.
781360	784480	And anyway, my chavahra.
784480	785480	That's it.
785480	789120	Anyway, so yeah, that happened, and it was really great, and then I had to go talk in
789120	790760	front of people on Friday.
790760	799080	But I played some Star Trek Online, and I had to go because Dan came home, and it was,
799080	802840	I don't know, I played a little bit, not a lot, just some.
802840	811640	And oh, oh, oh, oh, my anniversary was on Wednesday, my fifth anniversary, so Dan got
811640	815120	me this instead of a rose, so it was three ambitions.
815120	816520	And isn't that much better than a rose?
816520	823240	Yeah, he also wrote me a note that said, in fact, here it is, I'll put it up on the thing,
823240	824240	it's on my Facebook right now.
824240	829000	Sorry I didn't get you a rose, I thought you would like this more, I love you, D.
829000	830000	Aww.
830000	831600	I'll take a picture and put it on the thing.
831600	832600	That's sweet.
832600	833600	Yeah.
833600	835600	You should gush about him while he's not here to defend himself, it's really cute.
835600	838560	Because, you know, he has to be a manly man when he's here on the show, but.
838560	842440	I wish Dan would stop leaving his underwear in the hall.
842440	849680	Okay, let's move on to Loki, how was your gaming week?
849680	859680	My gaming week was pretty slim, I played more Grand Theft Auto, Lost and Damned, still fun.
859680	866720	And I played a few other things that I probably shouldn't be talking about, but I don't care,
866720	868840	because I'm not under any sort of NDA.
868840	875640	So I got my dev kit this week for the Xbox, you know, my Xbox 360 dev kit, and to be honest
875640	883720	it's not as exciting as I would have thought it would have been, because the network that
883720	890560	should not be named, that has partner in it, really only has Xbox Live Arcade games and
890560	895760	download content that they're testing, so there's a few games on there that haven't
895760	899740	really been leaked out for JTAG users and that kind of stuff, so I got to play a few
899740	905520	different Xbox Live Arcade games that aren't out yet, that are actually kind of cool.
905520	914640	So one of them that I played was Bonk, apparently they're remaking Bonk, from Bonk's Adventure,
914640	922120	the old TurboGrafx game, and it's okay, it's kind of done along the lines of how they did
922120	928080	the Hudson Adventure Island remake.
928080	933000	It's okay, but the one thing that they kind of took out of it that really made Bonk, Bonk,
933000	935640	is his giant head.
935640	941080	His head is now a little bit more proportioned to his body, which really sucks, because it
941080	945480	has the same type, like when you're climbing a wall before in Bonk's Adventure, he used
945480	946480	to use his teeth.
946480	950840	Well, in this, he's still biting the wall, but he also looks like he's climbing, so it
950840	953080	doesn't make any sense why he's biting the wall.
953080	956920	I don't remember a new Adventure Island game, was that on the Wii or something?
956920	957920	It was on the Wii.
957920	958920	Huh.
958920	961080	It was, I think it was a WiiWare game.
961080	962080	Nice.
962080	963080	But it wasn't very good.
963080	964080	Oh, okay.
964080	965080	That's too bad.
965080	971360	And this one's kind of just okay, but I don't know, it looks like it might be pretty fun,
971360	975480	I didn't play a whole lot of it, just a few levels, but it's alright.
975480	978920	It's just, I really wish they'd left his head in, you know, really big, oh, they don't really
978920	984800	have to change too much, just use like, just clean up the sprites a little bit, and go
984800	986600	from there, I mean.
986600	990680	The last Adventure Island game I remember playing that I just absolutely loved was Super
990680	994560	Adventure Island on the Super Nintendo, I don't know if you guys ever played this game,
994560	998520	but I think one of the reasons I really loved that game was the soundtrack to that game
998520	1000080	was amazing.
1000080	1004560	And it turns out Yuzo Koshiro was the guy that did the soundtrack for that, and if you
1004560	1007840	don't know him, he's done a lot of awesome game music.
1007840	1011280	He does like the Wangan, Midnight, Maximum Tune, a lot of those soundtracks.
1011280	1016880	I believe he did Actraiser, like yeah, he did the original Actraiser, Streets of Rage
1016880	1022120	2, Shinobi, I mean he's done so many like awesome soundtracks, so he's just, he's like
1022120	1026640	one of my favorite gaming musician guys.
1026640	1032340	Other things that I tried playing, Super Meat Boy was up there, but the version that they
1032340	1038440	have on Partner Net is broken, it doesn't go past the main menu because you can move
1038440	1041800	the cursor around on the menu, but no button that you press will actually allow you to
1041800	1045520	start the game, which kinda sucked, because I wanted to play that.
1045520	1053240	And then, what else did I play, there was one other game I played, it was a dancing
1053240	1058560	game that's coming out actually, yeah, Dance It's Your Stage, which we'll be talking about
1058560	1063680	coming out next week.
1063680	1070240	It's terrible, it's really, really bad, and I don't know, I'm not too familiar with the
1070240	1075080	game itself, but I think based off the music that I saw on there, and that guy looks like
1075080	1083480	a total douche, I believe it's, it says it's a port of a German Wii game, I think it's
1083480	1089320	based off of, yeah, it's based off of a TV show.
1089320	1093320	That's so strange that they're bringing it here then, does it have David Hasselhoff in
1093320	1095360	it then that you can dance to?
1095360	1100640	No, but the music though in it is just not good.
1100640	1102480	That's really the only thing that kinda sucks.
1102480	1109920	The gameplay itself isn't very good either because it's got two kind of, two areas where
1109920	1116720	I guess steps or directions will go down, but it's not like DDR or something where one
1116720	1119420	column's up, one column's down, etc.
1119420	1123640	It's mixed all over the place, and so you may have up in like the left column, then
1123640	1130760	up in the right column, and it gets really confusing when it's going really fast, and
1130760	1138560	then also the music's very, very, very, very terrible, so I really don't recommend picking
1138560	1143600	it up, not that many people probably would have next week anyways, but it is a terrible
1143600	1144600	game.
1144600	1147940	Very, very, very terrible game.
1147940	1149120	Is it bad?
1149120	1150120	It's very bad.
1150120	1151120	I wasn't sure.
1151120	1152120	It's terra-bad.
1152120	1153120	It's terra-bad.
1153120	1154120	Terra-bad.
1154120	1157120	What else did I play?
1157120	1164680	Oh yeah, one other, I played a cave shooter game, and I'm gonna butcher the name, I believe
1164680	1169960	it was called like Guranji or something like that, I don't know, it's just from memory
1169960	1170960	there.
1170960	1177360	Anyways, it's your typical cave shooter games, really, I guess, I don't really know the premise
1177360	1184040	of it because it was all in Japanese, but you can control kind of like a god deity thing
1184040	1189120	that's helping you out, and I don't know, it's just like all the other cave shmup games,
1189120	1193440	but that'll become the Xbox Live Arcade in Japan very soon I believe.
1193440	1195200	Not sure about over here.
1195200	1196200	Hopefully over here though.
1196200	1197200	Awesome.
1197200	1198200	That's fun.
1198200	1199200	Alright, that it?
1199200	1200200	Piggy mooing?
1200200	1201200	That is it.
1201200	1205840	I'm gonna be looking forward to your sneak peeks every week now of new stuff coming out
1205840	1206840	until you get shut down.
1206840	1211720	Yeah, until the console gets banned off, banned off PartnerNet.
1211720	1217200	Not that, usually when they would ban the consoles it's not, it's actually worse than
1217200	1222520	like if you got banned off live because when they ban your console they blow all the e-fuses
1222520	1225640	and it makes your console very broken.
1225640	1226640	Wow.
1226640	1227640	But.
1227640	1228640	That's kind of evil.
1228640	1233680	But the person that sold me the console took out the resistor that allows, you know, those
1233680	1240280	e-fuses to be blown, so if they ban me from PartnerNet, the console will be just fine.
1240280	1243920	That's kind of, that's like Mission Impossible where it's like this message will self-destruct
1243920	1244920	in 30 seconds.
1244920	1248680	Yeah, but here's the thing, you know, it's, if I got banned from PartnerNet I probably
1248680	1253680	wouldn't care because here I thought there was gonna be like, you know, actual beta tests
1253680	1255220	of games and stuff like that.
1255220	1256220	That's not the case.
1256220	1261100	And I could definitely see why they don't do that because people would be leaking that
1261100	1265680	crap left and right and even still with some of the arcade games people leak them out there
1265680	1269960	and you know, that's got to suck for them, but I don't know.
1269960	1270960	There's some neat stuff on there.
1270960	1275820	The whole fall lineup of stuff that we'll probably be covering later on is up there.
1275820	1276820	So some of it's pretty cool.
1276820	1278400	I played a little bit of Comic Jumper.
1278400	1284560	That was kind of neat, but really, really briefly checked it out, so.
1284560	1285560	All right.
1285560	1289800	Let's go to our chat room at chat.orangetonstrady.com, the always present fourth guest on the show,
1289800	1293080	although we really have like five people in the studio tonight, but who's counting?
1293080	1296320	Chat.orangetonstrady.com is where you can share your comments and we'll read them here
1296320	1297320	on air.
1297320	1301440	We'll start off tonight the marathon with a comment from Spazinator who is talking about
1301440	1304840	the soundtracks because I was talking about Yuzuru Koshiro a little bit ago, says, in
1304840	1311480	my opinion, the OSTs for Killer Instinct, Actraiser, Super Castlevania IV, and Mr. Bones
1311480	1313040	have the best music.
1313040	1315680	Those are all some really good soundtracks, although I don't know Mr. Bones.
1315680	1316680	What system was that on?
1316680	1317800	Is that PSN or something?
1317800	1326600	I think it was a PS3 and or a PSP game, but I know it came out on one of the Sony systems.
1326600	1328040	It was the skeleton guy.
1328040	1329040	Oh, okay.
1329040	1330040	You remember?
1330040	1331040	Well, hence the name Mr. Bones.
1331040	1332040	Yeah.
1332040	1333040	I think I might have it somewhere.
1333040	1334040	Okay.
1334040	1339880	The Killer Cuts CD that you got when you pre-ordered Killer Instinct on SNES was amazing.
1339880	1340880	Yes it was.
1340880	1342440	Hours and hours played in high school.
1342440	1344240	It wasn't necessarily a pre-order either.
1344240	1348000	I just went into Montgomery Wards back in the day and bought mine and I said, where's
1348000	1350000	my CD?
1350000	1351880	Nice.
1351880	1357880	I would say one of my favorites was not actually from the game at all, but was the soundtrack
1357880	1361880	to the Mortal Kombat motion picture because that CD was awesome.
1361880	1363280	Mortal Kombat.
1363280	1364280	Test your mind.
1364280	1366360	I have that song somewhere off the plate on break.
1366360	1367360	All right.
1367360	1368960	Anyway, let's move on to my gaming week.
1368960	1369960	I'll talk quickly about this.
1369960	1372120	Now, was that the Mortal Kombat game soundtrack?
1372120	1374440	No, the actual movie soundtrack was awesome.
1374440	1377480	Yeah, the Mortal movie soundtrack was awesome, but remember the one that they did for the
1377480	1378480	game?
1378480	1379480	Less awesome.
1379480	1380480	Oh, come on.
1380480	1381480	That was very awesome.
1381480	1382480	It was so awesome.
1382480	1385000	We used to play Keys or That soundtrack.
1385000	1388920	And Spaznator is clarifying in chat that Mr. Bones was a Sega Saturn game.
1388920	1389920	That was it.
1389920	1395920	Are you thinking about the Ghosts and Goblins kind of game that was on...
1395920	1396920	Nevermind.
1396920	1399280	Let's see.
1399280	1401040	We got a lot of other comments in chats here.
1401040	1402040	Oh.
1402040	1403040	What?
1403040	1404040	Sorry.
1404040	1405040	I was going to add one more thing to my gaming week.
1405040	1406040	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1406040	1409560	It's not really my gaming week yet, but it will be.
1409560	1416520	Unless you haven't read my Twitter, I will be getting an iPod touch.
1416520	1421800	Now, I know what you're thinking, this goes against my total hatred of Macs.
1421800	1422800	Wrong.
1422800	1424160	And really Apple in general.
1424160	1430720	Well, I kind of gotten blinded by the whole hating Macs because iPods are not Macs.
1430720	1433440	iPods are their own thing.
1433440	1434440	They're actually...
1434440	1437720	Sure, rationalize it however you can, Loki.
1437720	1439640	It's the backpedal express.
1439640	1441640	Choo choo.
1441640	1444720	To be fair, I didn't pay for this with my own money, so...
1444720	1446080	I think that's what it really is.
1446080	1449640	If he's being given them, how can he say no?
1449640	1452280	I mean, they are still great MP3 players and stuff.
1452280	1454200	No, I think they're decent MP3s.
1454200	1457280	Well, I don't really give a crap about playing MP3s, but...
1457280	1459800	Other game systems now, too, really.
1459800	1460800	Yeah.
1460800	1466960	But, you know, if they gave me the gift card and said you have to spend it on a Mac computer,
1466960	1469440	I think I'd have issues, but...
1469440	1470440	I'm fine with the new iPod.
1470440	1473000	But you're not going to be pre-ordering the Apple TV anytime soon.
1473000	1474000	Oh, fuck no.
1474000	1475000	I don't care.
1475000	1477920	Because there was a big Apple thing this week, and it actually involved gaming.
1477920	1481480	We'll get into that a little later, and we'll get more of Loki's thoughts at that point.
1481480	1484560	I want to read some more comments from chat, because chat is talking about other gaming
1484560	1485560	soundtracks.
1485560	1491440	Haseo Sumiragawa, I hope I said that right, says Final Fantasy X soundtrack for the win.
1491440	1494760	And let's see, Redertainment says the music from Brutal Legend was awesome.
1494760	1498420	Too bad they never released a formal original soundtrack for that game.
1498420	1504120	And then Cyberbeast, I love this, chimes in with, Daytona.
1504120	1507600	You know what game actually had, well, one of the little side soundtracks that they did
1507600	1510200	was Final Fantasy Prey and Celtic Moon.
1510200	1511200	Oh yeah.
1511200	1514640	Those were both gorgeous arrangements of the music.
1514640	1516720	Was Prey the one that was all piano?
1516720	1517960	Because there's one where all the songs were piano.
1517960	1519240	It was the lady singing.
1519240	1520240	Okay.
1520240	1521240	Well, there's a third.
1521240	1526280	It had a lot that was on piano, but Celtic Moon was all the, you know, Celtic style.
1526280	1527280	Right, right.
1527280	1528280	Good stuff.
1528280	1529280	Yeah.
1529280	1530280	All right.
1530280	1531280	All right.
1531280	1532280	We'll be keeping an eye on chat throughout the night.
1532280	1534280	Chat at orangesongsradio.com.
1534280	1537080	Amaysatsuma says, Loki, your soul is mine.
1537080	1538080	Love, Steve Jobs.
1538080	1539080	There you go.
1539080	1541320	I haven't spent the gift card on something.
1541320	1544400	It was either that or, like, a bunch of the nanos.
1544400	1548720	And what the hell would I do with a bunch of nanos or a bunch of the shuffles or whatever?
1548720	1553560	Well, I was telling Loki that here in California, there's actually a state law.
1553560	1554940	A lot of people don't know this.
1554940	1560480	But if you get a gift card, like, let's say somebody gives you a target card, or no, I
1560480	1561480	got one that's a lot more practical.
1561480	1565560	Somebody gives you a Walmart card for Christmas, and it's like, you know, 50 bucks or what
1565560	1566560	have you.
1566560	1568360	And you're like, ew, I don't like Walmart.
1568360	1569880	I'm not going to shop at Walmart ever.
1569880	1573240	You can actually take that gift card in and get the cash value of the card back.
1573240	1574480	There's actually a law in the books here.
1574480	1577320	I don't know what other states have that, but it's here.
1577320	1582040	But what a lot of companies do sometimes is that if they're buying these cards in bulk,
1582040	1583600	then there's a discount on them.
1583600	1589520	Like, you know, if a company buys $55 Starbucks cards to give away as an incentive, they might
1589520	1591240	reduce the cost of that.
1591240	1592920	So that way they have no cash value.
1592920	1594040	They're not really gift cards.
1594040	1595660	They're like coupons.
1595660	1597680	And so then you can't do that.
1597680	1600960	So it really depends if someone paid full cash value up front or not.
1600960	1601960	Yeah.
1601960	1602960	So.
1602960	1603960	All right.
1603960	1604960	And Zebo wants to know how you got the gift card.
1604960	1605960	What did you do?
1605960	1606960	Was it a present?
1606960	1607960	I don't know if you can talk about it.
1607960	1608960	No, I can talk about it.
1608960	1610760	It's not really anything I did.
1610760	1612160	It's actually what our video reps did.
1612160	1619840	Our video reps, they do sales incentives with Sony for various titles throughout the year.
1619840	1623840	And we've gotten a bunch of things actually from Sony and thankfully they do include us
1623840	1629200	game reps, even though we have nothing to do with this in on the little spiff.
1629200	1634960	So like, for example, we've gotten a Sony HDTV.
1634960	1640760	We've gotten a surround sound system, a camcorder, and they got a PlayStation 3.
1640760	1645080	I wasn't included on that, but don't care, I already have one.
1645080	1650920	And then we're going to be getting probably later on this year a Sony style card for $500.
1650920	1654480	So they actually gave us a $500 card for Apple.
1654480	1659920	Apparently they just said, eh, screw it, we don't care about the PSP, you know.
1659920	1660920	We give up.
1660920	1661920	Buy Apple.
1661920	1662920	You know?
1662920	1663920	So I think they're just trying to mix it up.
1663920	1667840	Tiara suggested that you could buy a bunch of shuffles and throw them like ninja stars.
1667840	1674920	No, I decided, because I'm nice and a wonderful husband and stuff, I bought myself an iPod.
1674920	1679600	The new iPod touch, eight gig, one for myself and one for my wife.
1679600	1681360	To which she's like, what am I going to do with that?
1681360	1683560	I'm like, God, I should have just spent it.
1683560	1684840	Put Bejeweled on it for her.
1684840	1686600	I was going, she doesn't care.
1686600	1688800	She's like, I can play Bejeweled online.
1688800	1692320	And she, you know, I'm like, well, you can browse the internet with that.
1692320	1694920	Well, can I just browse the internet anywhere or do I have to be on wifi?
1694920	1696360	Well, you have to be on wifi.
1696360	1697360	Well, that's stupid.
1697360	1699200	I'll just use my computer here.
1699200	1700200	Does Apple make diapers?
1700200	1702920	Because we could use those right now.
1702920	1707400	You should, you should sell it and get the money so we can put it in our savings account.
1707400	1709240	That's always the answer for stuff.
1709240	1713760	So you know, the next time, like when we get that Sony style card, she isn't getting shit.
1713760	1714760	That's all mine.
1714760	1718880	Then again, though, I don't know what the hell I'd get from Sony style for $500 because
1718880	1721720	Nelly sounds like my mother.
1721720	1724240	It's just her Jewiness, I guess.
1724240	1726000	Oh, wait, wait.
1726000	1729360	Dark soccer can officially be offended by that now.
1729360	1730760	I'm not offended.
1730760	1735160	She will just, she will just become more frugal.
1735160	1736160	That's yeah.
1736160	1737160	Yes.
1737160	1738160	I'm well aware.
1738160	1739160	Robot unicorn attack is on the app store.
1739160	1741160	I was just going to read that comment for Jay Dizzle and Jeff.
1741160	1742920	I will probably be downloading it.
1742920	1743920	Actually.
1743920	1744920	I want to download Mirror's Edge because that looks pretty awesome.
1744920	1745920	I have it on my phone.
1745920	1746920	If you want to look at it.
1746920	1747920	No.
1747920	1748920	The robot unicorn attack.
1748920	1749920	All right.
1749920	1750920	Anyway.
1750920	1751920	Look, he's like, I don't care.
1751920	1752920	I don't care.
1752920	1753920	All right.
1753920	1754920	Let me talk about my gaming week.
1754920	1755920	Um, my gaming week.
1755920	1756920	I actually didn't play a whole lot of new stuff.
1756920	1757920	Most of the same old, same old.
1757920	1759160	I will talk about one new thing I played.
1759160	1761160	I got to, uh, get a sneak peek at something.
1761160	1762160	Just like, look, he did.
1762160	1767120	I got to play World of Warcraft Cataclysm, the beta for that, uh, at least for a little
1767120	1768120	bit.
1768120	1771240	It worked for like a morning and then I couldn't get in all day yesterday.
1771240	1773640	So, um, Alan watched me play this too.
1773640	1774640	It was cool.
1774640	1779640	I rolled a Worgen and leveled it through about the first six levels and Worgen are very,
1779640	1781320	they seem really cool to me.
1781320	1786120	Like I, I think that the Blizzard went all out making their new, uh, race is pretty cool
1786120	1789120	because the Worgen, you know, they're all kind of like British people.
1789120	1792880	They all, they all talk like British people and you know, have the accents and everything.
1792880	1796920	And then it's just awesome because like right when you start it, like werewolves are attacking
1796920	1800840	and they're all over and it actually feels like a really bad like horror movie or something.
1800840	1801840	I don't know.
1801840	1802840	It was cool.
1802840	1803840	But yeah, go ahead.
1803840	1809800	I'll say, well, Gilneas is very Victorian, very 1800s and when, uh, Rob found a female
1809800	1813720	MPC and clicked on her, she said something and he's like, oh, they sound like the Spice
1813720	1814720	Girls.
1814720	1815720	Yes, they do.
1815720	1820160	So, uh, you know, I was, I was having fun with that and I leveled through about six
1820160	1824460	levels and I actually got to the part where you get, you actually turn into a werewolf,
1824460	1827940	but it's so great because in the beta right now it actually says there will be a movie
1827940	1833440	here where you transform into a Worgen and then it just warps you to the post movie place,
1833440	1834720	which I thought was really cool.
1834720	1836040	But there's just some awesome quests.
1836040	1837640	Like they're really starting to ramp up some of the quests.
1837640	1840760	Like let me tell you what my favorite quest I did was one where you have to go around
1840760	1844980	and you collect barrels and when you collect the barrels and you have to walk up to the
1844980	1851560	giant fat abomination creatures and you put the barrel on its head and then your character
1851560	1856920	will yell fire and then the camera zooms back in a seamless motion and it goes back up to
1856920	1861160	where you started the quest and there's a guy there with a gun and it shows him aiming
1861160	1865600	it at the barrel and pulling the trigger and you watch the bullet fly with the camera and
1865600	1871080	it hits the bullet and the abomination is saying something like, oh, me worried.
1871080	1875480	And then the bullet hits the barrel, which is filled with gunpowder and the dude explodes
1875480	1876640	and chunks go everywhere.
1876640	1877640	It's awesome.
1877640	1878920	And I was like, it sounds like fun.
1878920	1879920	It's getting hardcore.
1879920	1880960	I'm liking this stuff.
1880960	1884720	So and apparently I didn't play the goblin area yet, but apparently they have like a
1884720	1889760	highway through the goblin town and there's like all these like car racing, Mario Kart
1889760	1890980	type quests.
1890980	1894080	So they're getting crazy with all the different quests they have in the games.
1894080	1900600	I've heard it called Grand Theft Azshara because of all the little cars.
1900600	1901600	That's awesome.
1901600	1905600	So yeah, I know the, the crack is, is, is saying your name, dark Sakura.
1905600	1909440	I actually, I was just thinking that something that would be fun is if I play Sims all throughout
1909440	1913760	the show and have a house built by the end of the show, if you want, if you want to go
1913760	1916480	or started at five or I'll log into Star Trek online.
1916480	1917480	All right.
1917480	1918480	No, no, no, no, no.
1918480	1919480	I wouldn't do that.
1919480	1920480	I don't know.
1920480	1922560	Honestly guys, I don't know what we're going to do once the regular show is over.
1922560	1925040	We're going to fill seven hours of radio somehow.
1925040	1926040	We'll figure it out.
1926040	1927040	We get there.
1927040	1928840	Uh, but that was really the only new thing I played this week was, was the cataclysm
1928840	1929840	beta.
1929840	1930840	That was one of the new 80 stuff.
1930840	1934760	Cause like I said, I played it once and I was waiting for my character to copy over
1934760	1935760	and it wasn't there yet.
1935760	1937160	And then I wasn't able to get back in.
1937160	1939440	I don't know if there's a problem with my account or what's going on.
1939440	1942040	So I'll just have to figure it out later.
1942040	1947200	So, uh, but yeah, Worgen thumbs up for me, that was a fun little opening quest.
1947200	1950480	I always like it and to see some of this new stuff, but I gotta be careful how much of
1950480	1954200	it I play because I don't want to ruin the actual release.
1954200	1957040	But luckily a lot of it is still really janky.
1957040	1961920	Like there's missing textures in some places and you know, a lot of like odd things, you
1961920	1964080	know, so the, the full release will still be good.
1964080	1971080	Speaking of janky, um, did, uh, the final fantasy 11 or not 11, might as well be 11
1971080	1972080	cause it sucks.
1972080	1976080	Uh, no, the final fantasy 14 beta, the open beta start this week.
1976080	1977080	I don't remember.
1977080	1979580	Sort of, but a lot of people are having problems getting in.
1979580	1983240	I guess you have to actually register for the open beta and they're only letting so
1983240	1984720	many people in at a time.
1984720	1985720	That's not closed beta.
1985720	1986720	That's stupid.
1986720	1987720	I'm hearing they're having a lot of problems.
1987720	1994000	It's either limiting the amount of people that can play the beta, just like the time.
1994000	1999360	I got an email inviting me to the open beta and I saw like the next morning or whatever
1999360	2001840	and I didn't bother signing up for it cause I don't care.
2001840	2006160	But on my Facebook, a lot of people, I guess they've got the same email and we're saying
2006160	2010440	that once you click through on the email, it was only open for like an hour of signups
2010440	2012440	and then they reclosed it.
2012440	2013440	So it's.
2013440	2014440	Yeah.
2014440	2015440	Yeah.
2015440	2016440	That games, that games in a lot of trouble.
2016440	2021440	Uh, I'm, I'm worried they, they, they really, if they're smart, they're going to push back
2021440	2023600	the release of that game and not try to release it.
2023600	2024920	But it might be too late now.
2024920	2025920	I don't know.
2025920	2030720	Uh, but also speaking of release dates, playing this world of Warcraft beta got me thinking.
2030720	2032660	I don't think it's coming out this year.
2032660	2035720	Like I know Blizzard has swore up and down that they're going to try and get it out this
2035720	2036720	year.
2036720	2041060	Uh, if they make this year, mid December is like the earliest you're going to see this
2041060	2042060	game.
2042060	2043260	It'll be out before Christmas.
2043260	2044260	It's going to be mid December.
2044260	2047800	Then it had like you when you say before Christmas, you mean like two weeks before before Christmas
2047800	2053160	because they've already sent out a map notice, um, saying that their map, um, stuff's ending
2053160	2054160	on the 25th.
2054160	2055160	Really?
2055160	2061640	I feel like there's a lot left still of, um, I mean, that can change it doesn't really
2061640	2065760	matter that they sent out that notice, but I'm just saying that right now that's what
2065760	2068280	they're saying is that it's going to be out before Christmas.
2068280	2071920	Well, they're probably waiting to announce the actual release date at Blizzcon, but I'm,
2071920	2075080	I'm thinking mid December because there's still all this stuff they got to do.
2075080	2079460	They've got to do the actual patch for Cataclysm, which will probably be about three weeks before
2079460	2080920	the game releases.
2080920	2084360	They've got to do the world event that leads up to the Cataclysm, which is a good, you
2084360	2085960	know, another three weeks.
2085960	2090160	They've got to do one more patch still of the taking of Nomur, Nomurgan and, uh, Echo
2090160	2091160	Islands.
2091160	2092460	You know, that still has to happen too.
2092460	2097640	So there's still a good 10 weeks of plot content that has to happen before the game can come
2097640	2098640	out.
2098640	2101040	So there's only so much time left, so we'll see.
2101040	2102040	All right.
2102040	2104800	Um, let's move on to our guests and their gaming weeks.
2104800	2107760	Uh, Alan, how was your gaming week?
2107760	2109520	Um, pretty boring.
2109520	2112560	Same old, same old, uh, maybe an hour or two of Zuma's Revenge.
2112560	2113560	Revisited that.
2113560	2114560	A lot of fun.
2114560	2116040	And then just a lot of wow.
2116040	2117040	No real developments there.
2117040	2119240	What's your big wow accomplishments lately?
2119240	2125040	Um, I got enough rep with the Oracles to buy their stupid egg that hatches once a week
2125040	2127480	to try and get the mount from it.
2127480	2128480	That's about it.
2128480	2129480	Good times.
2129480	2130480	Very boring.
2130480	2131480	Good times.
2131480	2132480	All right.
2132480	2136000	Any other games that you like to play regularly outside of wow, just so the listeners don't
2136000	2142440	think you play wow all time, all the day, although that may be what you actually do.
2142440	2143440	That's really it.
2143440	2144440	That's it.
2144440	2145440	Yeah.
2145440	2146440	Come on.
2146440	2147440	Puzzle Quest 2.
2147440	2148440	I've talked about that before.
2148440	2149440	Um, Zuma's Revenge.
2149440	2153360	Like I just said, I played Peggle on your phone, your new iPhone 4 that we got last
2153360	2154360	week.
2154360	2155360	Peggle is crack.
2155360	2156360	Yeah.
2156360	2157360	Peggle is really awesome.
2157360	2158360	All right.
2158360	2162960	Um, some of our listeners are saying the stream is skipping.
2162960	2167280	I don't know what's going on, but, uh, with a 12 hour show, I'm sure it's going
2167280	2171040	to be a problem through a lot of it, but just to remind everybody in studio, whatever bandwidth
2171040	2172040	you got to make sure.
2172040	2174600	I did forget to close my torrents, so I just closed them.
2174600	2175600	Uh ohs.
2175600	2176600	Okay.
2176600	2177600	There you go.
2177600	2178600	All right.
2178600	2179600	Maybe that'll help.
2179600	2180600	So we'll see.
2180600	2182160	Um, if it still is skipping in about 10 minutes, I'll try rebooted the stream.
2182160	2185400	But meanwhile, I think I kind of asked Bradley about his game a week and he said he was doing
2185400	2188320	mostly traveling, but I'll ask again if there's anything you want to throw out there, Bradley.
2188320	2189320	Okay.
2189320	2193440	So there was no games this week, but I want to go with my last week because I was playing
2193440	2198640	a bunch of games then I played, uh, played the shadow complex that was, that's a fun
2198640	2199640	game.
2199640	2201120	That was for last year's summer arcade.
2201120	2205320	I've actually bought all the ones for this year, even though just mainly because I bought
2205320	2206320	the four of them.
2206320	2208120	So I bought Monday night combat as well.
2208120	2212240	I played through the demo and it's a game I probably might pay a little bit, but it's
2212240	2217200	not one I'd play a lot because one of those team based combat games I'm not a big on,
2217200	2221800	but, uh, uh, Castlevania HD, I didn't play that last week, but I've played through the,
2221800	2222800	through the game on that.
2222800	2223800	And that's fun.
2223800	2227760	It's, it's kind of one thing that, yeah, as you said on one of the previous podcasts was
2227760	2231600	that, uh, it was kind of weird because it's like you have a 30 minute time limit limit
2231600	2233880	to find the boss and get it done.
2233880	2238160	And that, that, that makes it kind of difficult because if you screw up somewhere like 22,
2238160	2242280	like you're 29 minutes in, you're trying to kill the boss and you run out of time, you
2242280	2243560	have to do the whole level again.
2243560	2247400	So that kind of makes it hard for a one player when you do the single player.
2247400	2249880	Plus it's sometimes hard to find the damn boss.
2249880	2253920	Like I get lost in those maps, like, because they change every game somehow like little
2253920	2254960	doors move or something.
2254960	2256600	I think it's a pain.
2256600	2259960	Well, that's sort of the way they deal with the HD where you change the, you can change
2259960	2260960	the size of the map.
2260960	2265800	You can zoom out and kind of look at, look at your map and, uh, cause some things open
2265800	2269400	certain doors and once you learn the pattern and you can do it, but that's, that's how
2269400	2270400	you do that one.
2270400	2274840	Uh, uh, let's see what the other, other games, uh, limbo, that one's, that one's actually
2274840	2276480	a pretty cool game.
2276480	2278520	It's at least it's, it's worth a play.
2278520	2284160	It's if it's cause it's a, it might be a bit expensive for the $15 just cause it's, if
2284160	2287280	the first playthrough of it, it only took me about three and a half hours.
2287280	2290600	And if, once you learn the puzzles, it only takes about, it's only an hour game, but it's
2290600	2294480	definitely worth playing cause it's, cause it's really atmospheric and a pretty, some
2294480	2299720	pretty cool like sort of, uh, scenes in the game, like the hotel sign that's kind of charging
2299720	2304240	on and off with, uh, this, with, uh, with, uh, the electricity.
2304240	2309280	So if you jump at the wrong time, you'll get, you'll get electrocuted as like really pretty
2309280	2310600	cool sounds to it.
2310600	2316120	Uh, also, uh, cause Hydro Thunder, Thunder Hurricane, that's fun and kind of fun playing
2316120	2317120	online.
2317120	2318280	They're, they're online service.
2318280	2323480	The online like game thing is kind of, there's sort of a little bit screwy that if you find
2323480	2328280	you're in a match and you, and you get kicked out of it or, or if it's, you don't want to
2328280	2331160	play that one, you have to go back to the beginning, to the menu and then reload it.
2331160	2333520	That's kind of the only bad thing about that one.
2333520	2339040	Uh, let's see what the other, the other game in there, uh, Lara Croft and the Guardian
2339040	2340040	of Light.
2340040	2341040	Yeah.
2341040	2342040	Yeah.
2342040	2343040	I did play that.
2343040	2344040	I played like through the first four levels.
2344040	2345040	That's pretty fun.
2345040	2346600	I haven't played the co-op because I don't have, I haven't had a second person there
2346600	2351160	to play it, but it sounds interesting from what you said last week or two weeks ago,
2351160	2352160	I think.
2352160	2353160	Yeah.
2353160	2354160	I was definitely a fan boy for that game.
2354160	2355160	I'm not even going to lie.
2355160	2357240	That was, it was kind of one of those like surprises.
2357240	2359240	Like I wasn't expecting to like it as much as I did.
2359240	2360240	I really wasn't.
2360240	2361760	So that was, it was cool.
2361760	2363920	I like the arcade feel that game a lot.
2363920	2365880	Feels like, it feels like playing gauntlet kind of.
2365880	2366880	Yeah.
2366880	2367880	It's cool.
2367880	2368880	Yeah.
2368880	2369880	And also played a burnout revenge.
2369880	2372840	I had been like a year, like almost like nine or eight, 10 months since I played it last,
2372840	2379000	but I like the burnout games as they're, that's like arcade, like the racing simulator, simulators,
2379000	2383920	but arcade racing, just fun knocking people off the road and trying to get the thing except
2383920	2388080	for like the burning laps and the, and like preview races where you have to beat a certain
2388080	2392560	time are really annoying because if you die, if you mess up one time, you have to restart
2392560	2394520	the whole race and start over and over.
2394520	2398680	It takes like an hour to get a gold on it or perfect rating on it.
2398680	2400240	All right.
2400240	2404200	Um, well, um, I guess that's going to do it for everybody's gaming weeks.
2404200	2405560	So you all right over there?
2405560	2407120	Crash knocked my fork over.
2407120	2411160	I, it was my delicious food, which I'm not going to describe.
2411160	2412560	It's still very garlicky.
2412560	2413560	All right.
2413560	2414560	Nothing wrong with garlic.
2414560	2415560	All right.
2415560	2418880	Let's move into some gaming news after we do some housekeeping tonight.
2418880	2421480	I don't have a whole lot to add other than the, we already talked about, we're going
2421480	2423800	to be going a long, long, long show tonight.
2423800	2426360	Um, I'm trying to see if the skipping problems resolved.
2426360	2427960	Looks like some people are saying, yeah, it's better.
2427960	2431360	Some are saying it's still going, so we'll see, we'll give it a few more minutes to work
2431360	2432360	itself out.
2432360	2437400	Um, and otherwise I guess I'll say add us on Twitter, twitter.com slash O L R and on
2437400	2440080	Facebook, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.
2440080	2442920	If you follow us on there, we can give you updates so that you know, if we're going to
2442920	2445480	be doing a show early or whatever's going on.
2445480	2447520	Uh, all right, let's get into some news.
2447520	2451640	Let's finally start talking some actual gaming news here today.
2451640	2454240	Big news out of penny arcade expo, right?
2454240	2455240	Loki.
2455240	2456240	Oh yeah.
2456240	2461880	This is kind of like a very surprising news, but you know, probably I'm sure people are
2461880	2463240	taking it with a grain of salt.
2463240	2471580	Duke Nukem forever is coming out 2011 on Xbox 360 PlayStation three and PC, um, is now being
2471580	2477480	developed by gearbox, um, software with the help of a two K games.
2477480	2485360	And uh, they are finishing with 3d realms took over 10 years to, uh, start I guess.
2485360	2492240	And uh, it was playable on the show floor and um, it's everything Duke Nukem should
2492240	2498840	be, you know, with, uh, you know, being able to pee everywhere and you know, blowjob into
2498840	2505640	windows and, um, you know, are there strippers punching eyeballs across, you know, a football
2505640	2506640	field.
2506640	2507640	Good stuff.
2507640	2515240	All right, here, here's where I want to start is this is obviously yay, funny gaming news,
2515240	2518440	you know, like hooray, it's finally happening, but at the same time, there's a part of me
2518440	2522840	that goes, okay, well look, I don't think this is really the same game that Duke Nukem
2522840	2525480	forever was, was originally going to be.
2525480	2529040	And um, you know, that might be kind of a duh because it's probably been like five different
2529040	2534580	games over the past 13 years or however long it's been, but, um, I honestly think after
2534580	2541600	the closure of 3d realms, I think these guys probably got the IP and probably nuked everything
2541600	2542600	that had happened before.
2542600	2547960	I mean, I know they say that they've taken what 3d realm started or whatever, but I go,
2547960	2553400	they took an idea probably, or they took the idea of what Duke Nukem should be and have
2553400	2555760	just kind of run with it and made it their own.
2555760	2557880	That's, that's kind of what I think this game really is.
2557880	2562440	And it's like, let's give it to a developer who's not going to take 13 years to finish
2562440	2563440	it.
2563440	2567200	It's as though they've been working on since late 2009 and says, uh, we're in the Paul's
2567200	2568640	Sheen phase right now.
2568640	2572680	This game, this is a game where we cannot make a promise.
2572680	2579240	We cannot fulfill, uh, we need to get past the shock and awe and then we can go to all
2579240	2583040	the retailers and first parties and work with our launch plan.
2583040	2585560	So it will be coming out though.
2585560	2587400	Um, I'm excited.
2587400	2592120	I love the Duke Nukem games and to be honest, just the screenshots and the like the little
2592120	2596080	cam videos that they had of the gameplay, it looks good.
2596080	2601440	It looks like, you know, cause I think they're really going to kind of keep the vibe of the
2601440	2605640	old games in there and it's just going to be souped up now and gearbox, you know, they've
2605640	2608480	definitely got a good pedigree as far as first person shooters go.
2608480	2612080	So I'm pretty confident that they'll churn out a good game.
2612080	2613080	Awesome.
2613080	2614080	Uh, multiplayer.
2614080	2615520	They're not really showing a lot of that.
2615520	2618240	There will be good multiplayer though if gearbox is involved.
2618240	2620400	I hope they do like map editing and all that stuff.
2620400	2621400	Although I hope so.
2621400	2622760	It's kind of hard to do.
2622760	2626280	I was some of the most fun part of the original Duke Nukem is looking at all those custom
2626280	2628520	max maps that would come out for that.
2628520	2633280	Maybe the PC version, but I don't know about the, um, three 16 PS three, uh, go to our
2633280	2637440	chat room chat, that orange sounds radio.com spazzinator says Duke Nukem forever coming
2637440	2638440	out.
2638440	2639440	Sky did hell freeze over.
2639440	2640440	What's next?
2640440	2644720	Super bowl, uh, D blue guy says DNF is coming out.
2644720	2648560	Next thing you know, valve might actually talk about episode three.
2648560	2649560	Perish the thought.
2649560	2650560	I don't know about that.
2650560	2654080	I know that's a topic near and dear to your heart, Alan, right?
2654080	2655680	Quaking with rage right now.
2655680	2656680	Yes.
2656680	2662120	Once, once portal two is out, their next press release better have half life in it.
2662120	2664000	All right, we'll see.
2664000	2665000	All right.
2665000	2666520	Uh, let's move on to another topic.
2666520	2670760	Uh, we'll know more about that game, I guess, closer to when it actually releases, which
2670760	2673240	it sounds like is actually going to happen at some point.
2673240	2674240	Hooray.
2674240	2677040	Uh, talking about another thing that's a float around out there.
2677040	2680280	I'm not sure if they're showing this at PAX, but I guess the news broke.
2680280	2682240	Um, I actually heard about it.
2682240	2684440	Thanks to the, um, GameStop managers conference.
2684440	2687280	They were showing this, which was the week before packs.
2687280	2691080	And I think a lot of the stuff that was at is at PAX now was probably at this conference
2691080	2694900	like the week before, but this was one of them and it has to do with the new Xbox three
2694900	2696400	60 controller.
2696400	2699560	It's a redesign of the Xbox three 60 wireless controller.
2699560	2700560	It's now going to be silver.
2700560	2705760	It kind of has this black, white, silver look to it, uh, with only the green being in the
2705760	2707620	lights for the Xbox logo.
2707620	2709120	That's really the only place they are.
2709120	2718960	Uh, otherwise the other big change to this, a new d-pad finally in America, they are fixing
2718960	2722880	the d-pad, but not only are they fixing it, it's, it's really different.
2722880	2723880	What they're doing.
2723880	2726160	It's a transforming d-pad.
2726160	2732400	What you can do, you can pop out the plus sign to have it just be the plus sign, or
2732400	2738000	you can actually have a whole little like kind of reverse analog stick, if you will,
2738000	2743280	like more of like a sunken hole type of controller, what it is now, basically kind of, yeah.
2743280	2747840	So you can, you can have one or the other, uh, by doing a little rotation with that.
2747840	2753080	Um, so if you want to play something like, you know, an old school street fighter game,
2753080	2756520	you can pop it out one way if you're playing like a, a shooter like Halo Reach, maybe you
2756520	2758280	want to do another way.
2758280	2760020	Here's the interesting thing about it though, right?
2760020	2762000	How much do you think this controller is going to cost?
2762000	2766960	Well, I already know the answer to that, so I can't say.
2766960	2767960	45.
2767960	2768960	45 says.
2768960	2769960	About-ish.
2769960	2770960	About-ish.
2770960	2771960	Here's the thing.
2771960	2772960	It's $64.99 for this new controller.
2772960	2774160	You know why?
2774160	2779720	They're only selling it with the play and charge kit as a bundle, and it's a limited
2779720	2780960	edition.
2780960	2784520	And there's a part of me that kind of goes like, like looks in that, looks at that and
2784520	2787080	goes, you little shits.
2787080	2791320	Like you know your controller is a problem.
2791320	2793960	You've known this for a long time.
2793960	2800560	You've fixed it with limited releases, like some sort of tease, like time again in Europe.
2800560	2804880	And now you think you're finally releasing something kind of a step beyond that here.
2804880	2808260	You're going to gouge for it when it's like a problem in the first place.
2808260	2811040	Like you suck.
2811040	2812040	You're a dick.
2812040	2813480	Whoever thought of this?
2813480	2818560	I mean, I like the look to the controller though, even though it is a little weird that
2818560	2822440	like the buttons are not that yellow, blue, red, green color.
2822440	2826360	Yeah, that's going to be wonderful for, I don't know, players that are new and that
2826360	2834400	they have like color, you know, little indicators and stuff on the screen that correspond to
2834400	2835400	those buttons.
2835400	2839000	Oh, the buttons don't have colors because they're black and white.
2839000	2841600	Why even, why did they do that?
2841600	2844120	That's just dumb.
2844120	2849240	The only way that I would see that being acceptable is if they were like backlit with those actual
2849240	2850240	colors.
2850240	2853700	So it looks gray when it's turned off, but actually has colors shining through when you
2853700	2855400	turn it on.
2855400	2856960	But that's not the case with this.
2856960	2860480	That's just them being dumb.
2860480	2864480	Monty Boggs in our chat room says, I'm sure the only thing limited is the bundle and color.
2864480	2866600	They will continue with the new D pad.
2866600	2867600	Hmm.
2867600	2868800	I hope you're right on that.
2868800	2869800	I don't know.
2869800	2871840	They haven't really said on that though.
2871840	2873560	Maybe this is a trial thing.
2873560	2877500	This is a trick to get you to buy it right now for $65.
2877500	2879220	So we'll see.
2879220	2881520	They're trying to get you suckers on an impulse buy.
2881520	2882520	That's what it is.
2882520	2883520	I don't know.
2883520	2884520	All right.
2884520	2885520	Uh, let's move on.
2885520	2886520	Dark soccer.
2886520	2887520	What do you got for us?
2887520	2893740	Well, in the realm of a PlayStation, it actually, uh, they were sending out a survey seeing
2893740	2901180	if people would be interested in, um, having the, uh, a digital comic service, um, on the
2901180	2904840	PS3 and not just on the PSP.
2904840	2909160	And um, so I'm not sure if they're actually going to do that now, but I mean, it would
2909160	2912840	be kind of neat being able to read my comics on the TV.
2912840	2917840	Although honestly I can just look at my digital comics on my computer and we have a computer
2917840	2919260	hooked up to our TV in the front room.
2919260	2920480	So big diff.
2920480	2925480	Um, I think nothing's really going to replace, you know, actually having paper in your hand
2925480	2931960	and reading the comic and going, who pretty, you know, but for those that want it, it's
2931960	2932960	available.
2932960	2933960	Well, good for them.
2933960	2938220	I mean, if they want to use, if Sony wants to do it good for them, maybe they'll get
2938220	2939280	something out of it.
2939280	2944000	I don't know that it's going to be worth the expenditure.
2944000	2946900	I read comics on my iPhone, you know, having it handheld.
2946900	2949720	That's one thing, but yeah, those are a little more portable, you know?
2949720	2953480	You don't have to take a book that you'd worry about ruining, you know?
2953480	2956240	Oh, I'm at work right now and I want to read a comic.
2956240	2959160	I mean, I'm not at work and want to read a comic.
2959160	2960160	I'm on my lunch.
2960160	2962520	Yeah, I'm on my lunch break and want to read a comic.
2962520	2968840	I have my break sign up all day.
2968840	2972320	I'm surprised you haven't brought this up in your comic podcast yet because that's you,
2972320	2975680	you tape those, you taped a comic podcast this morning, right?
2975680	2978160	Yeah, but we focus more on the comics themselves.
2978160	2979160	I see.
2979160	2980160	Where, where can they download that?
2980160	2984080	I'll let you work in a cheap plug for your new old spinoff show.
2984080	2987320	Infamous gamers.net is the site.
2987320	2991760	It's no I, there's just an N. The letter N. Yeah, nice.
2991760	2995000	And um, oh, it's actually just infamous.net.
2995000	2996000	Yeah.
2996000	2997960	It used to be infamous gamers.com.
2997960	3004000	Um, but in the meantime though, you also can find easier links right now on our various
3004000	3005420	Twitters and whatnot.
3005420	3006420	Very cool.
3006420	3007420	Yeah.
3007420	3008420	All right.
3008420	3009420	Thanks for your time.
3009420	3011680	And you're totally a sucker for having done that already this morning.
3011680	3015080	So you've already been broadcasting for an hour or two, right?
3015080	3016680	We were Skype casting.
3016680	3017680	Skype casting.
3017680	3018680	That works.
3018680	3019680	That's how we do it is Skype.
3019680	3020680	And when do your new episodes come out?
3020680	3021680	Cause you tape today.
3021680	3023520	And every so often we get Dalek voice.
3023520	3025080	You tape today, but it'll come out what?
3025080	3026080	Tomorrow?
3026080	3027080	Tomorrow.
3027080	3028080	Okay, very cool.
3028080	3029960	So I've got, after we're done here, I've got editing to do.
3029960	3030960	Fun.
3030960	3031960	Good luck with that.
3031960	3032960	Uh, all right.
3032960	3033960	All right.
3033960	3037440	Moving on to more stories, Loki.
3037440	3042440	So um, it's kind of funny, um, Medal of Honor, you know, a big game that's going to be coming
3042440	3050040	out from ETH, um, EA this October, uh, is actually banned from military, um, bases.
3050040	3055240	At least, uh, Gamestop's located in military, um, bases.
3055240	3063960	Apparently, uh, this is a decision, I guess, um, by Gamestop and also with, um, I believe,
3063960	3072920	uh, they said, uh, the PX commanding general, uh, was it the commanding general of the army
3072920	3078480	and air forces exchange services, I guess I made the decision about that.
3078480	3084180	Um, so it says Gamestop has agreed out of respect for our past and present men and women
3084180	3085180	in uniform.
3085180	3090160	We will not carry Medal of Honor in any of our AAFES based stores.
3090160	3095360	At this time, it does not include our four stores on marine installations.
3095360	3103320	Um, Gamestop fully supports the AAFES and in this endeavor and it's, and it is sensitive
3103320	3110480	to the fact in multiplayer mode, uh, one side will assume the role of Taliban fighters.
3110480	3116680	As such, Gamestop has agreed to, um, have all marketing materials pulled by noon today
3116680	3122720	and stop taking reservations, customers who entered our AAFES stores and wish to reserve
3122720	3127720	Medal of Honor, uh, can and should be directed to the nearest Gamestop location off base.
3127720	3134760	Again, we appreciate the sensitivity and know, um, our AAFES based stores will continue to
3134760	3140240	honor, um, the great customer base in which they serve.
3140240	3144040	And of course that is because the Taliban are in multiplayer.
3144040	3148640	Oh yes, because, you know, our soldiers can go and fight, you know, in Iraq and stuff
3148640	3153360	like that, but oh my God, the Taliban's in a video game and then we're going to flip
3153360	3156200	out because they can't handle that.
3156200	3157920	It's dumb.
3157920	3161920	That's just like saying we should remove all the Germans out of Call of Duty because, you
3161920	3169280	know, they offended people in World War II and the Holocaust and stuff like that.
3169280	3172620	You know, we should, uh, we should stop selling those games everywhere because people were
3172620	3176320	affected by the Holocaust.
3176320	3177320	I don't know.
3177320	3178840	I would find it a little weird in the first place.
3178840	3185920	I mean, not weird, but I would like when I'm not working, I don't want to like think about
3185920	3187920	and do work, if that makes sense.
3187920	3189840	Like, and I know Medal of Honor is fake.
3189840	3190840	Okay.
3190840	3195100	But still it's kind of like when you're working, you know, you're doing all this military stuff
3195100	3200160	and then when you are off, you want to continue to do military stuff in a game.
3200160	3203520	Like, don't you want to play like Mario Kart or something?
3203520	3204520	Don't they understand?
3204520	3211040	I understand that, you know, that the Taliban are, you know, not good people, but it's a
3211040	3212040	video game.
3212040	3216800	It'd be like, if you replace the Taliban with space aliens, it's still the opposing team.
3216800	3217800	That's all it is.
3217800	3218800	It's not real Taliban.
3218800	3222160	When you play the game and kill people with the Taliban in there, it doesn't really kill
3222160	3223680	real people in real life.
3223680	3224680	Okay.
3224680	3225680	It is a game.
3225680	3233400	And if you're offended by that game, you know, then you don't have to buy it, you know.
3233400	3238200	And besides, isn't that what you're fighting for, our freedom, you know, and the freedom
3238200	3239200	of expression.
3239200	3242200	I mean, this is kind of an art form, I guess.
3242200	3244880	And if you're offended by it, well then don't buy it.
3244880	3245880	Oil.
3245880	3252240	Well, yeah, I understand it's oil as well, but I mean, there's still the fighting for
3252240	3255880	freedom kind of crap because, you know, you're trying to save everybody from the terrorists.
3255880	3259320	So I just, I don't understand what the big deal is.
3259320	3263640	What's also interesting is that they're really not the first, you know, um, country U.S.
3263640	3267360	to take issue with this because I think we had a story on the show last week, right,
3267360	3270600	about the British had a problem with this game too.
3270600	3275360	And we're talking about banning it, I think, in Britain completely with this.
3275360	3277360	Well, let me put it this way.
3277360	3280900	GameStop is not the only store on those military bases.
3280900	3284440	And you know, they may not be carrying it, but other stores will.
3284440	3286900	So all that means to them is just lost sales.
3286900	3288480	So have at it.
3288480	3290160	Because you know what?
3290160	3293520	I think most military people will not care.
3293520	3296040	Redertainment in our chatroom kind of reiterates a point here.
3296040	3300640	We also support the ability of people in the military to go off base and buy the game.
3300640	3303360	Again, go off base and buy the game.
3303360	3307160	So you know, it's not like the game is banned altogether.
3307160	3311240	I mean, that would kind of be against the Constitution, but you know, they just, they
3311240	3313640	don't have to support it, I suppose.
3313640	3319500	So it's just something that they did because they think it's, you know, out of respect
3319500	3322920	to those who serve, we will not be stocking this game.
3322920	3328080	And they apologize for any inconvenience it may have caused.
3328080	3330640	But at the same time, they're like, well, just go off base and buy it.
3330640	3331640	I don't understand.
3331640	3334400	I don't understand what the big deal is then.
3334400	3338280	If you were saying, oh, well, we don't want it on the base because that sets the wrong
3338280	3339280	precedent.
3339280	3341600	But you can buy it off base and bring it back in.
3341600	3342600	That's fine.
3342600	3343600	All right.
3343600	3347640	Let's talk about something a little less serious than these types of games and talk about something
3347640	3349720	a little more casual, shall we?
3349720	3352700	This is also news that's coming out of Penny Arcade Expo.
3352700	3356480	It's a brand new crossover game from Telltale Games.
3356480	3360560	You might remember there was a teaser that I believe we brought up on the show last week.
3360560	3366480	So let's see, if you could imagine, what would Homestar Runner, the guys from Penny Arcade,
3366480	3372440	Sam and Max, and now Team Fortress 2 characters, what are they all going to do on their, in
3372440	3374080	a new game together?
3374080	3375080	Plush it up?
3375080	3376080	Nope.
3376080	3377520	They're going to play poker.
3377520	3380000	That is the new game coming out from Telltale Games.
3380000	3381600	It's a poker game.
3381600	3383520	It's called Poker Night at the Inventory.
3383520	3387360	It comes out for the PC and the Mac for only five bucks this fall.
3387360	3389200	So at least it's, you know, kind of cheap.
3389200	3390880	It's going to support Steamworks.
3390880	3393000	That's why Team Fortress is now a part of this.
3393000	3395960	It's going to be, you know, really integrating Steam and all that.
3395960	3400800	They say there are, quote, more than a few surprises still in store.
3400800	3403360	They are apparently showing off the game right now at PAX.
3403360	3406000	They've got posters and all that good stuff.
3406000	3410880	Dan Connors, the CEO of Telltale, quote, we've had the idea for some time of exploring the
3410880	3416160	idea of what video game characters do when they're not on the clock in the games we play.
3416160	3419520	We pitched the idea to friends in the industry and it really resonated.
3419520	3423680	We all had a great time imagining what these guys would banter about while slinging cards
3423680	3427080	from their Poker Night at the Inventory was born.
3427080	3429880	So it sounds like this game is going to have a lot of smack talking in it, which might
3429880	3433560	be kind of cool because like Homestar Runner talking shit will actually be really funny,
3433560	3434560	I think.
3434560	3435560	And some of these...
3435560	3438920	I think you're a stupid poopy head.
3438920	3442040	So we'll see.
3442040	3445060	What I think is another thing to kind of draw out of that quote.
3445060	3448400	We pitched the idea to friends in the industry.
3448400	3455360	So they got this guy from Valve, the Team Fortress 2 dude is in here, as one of the
3455360	3456800	playable characters.
3456800	3459160	So my thought is, who else are they talking to?
3459160	3460600	What other characters are going to show up?
3460600	3464640	I bet some other big heavy hitter PC titles come into this too.
3464640	3467140	I don't think it's just going to end here.
3467140	3469700	There could be some other crossovers coming into this.
3469700	3470700	So you know...
3470700	3473560	Should have Shell just sitting there being quiet or Gordon Freeman sitting there being
3473560	3474560	quiet.
3474560	3475560	They're not supposed to say anything the whole time.
3475560	3476560	You never know.
3476560	3477560	Anything's possible.
3477560	3478960	But they're not supposed to say anything.
3478960	3479960	I don't know.
3479960	3482440	Any other characters you guys think might fit in here?
3482440	3484400	Hopefully some of the dudes from Back to the Future.
3484400	3485400	C-Man.
3485400	3488680	How about a velociraptor from the new Jurassic Park game?
3488680	3489680	I think C-Man.
3489680	3490680	C-Man?
3490680	3491680	You know, when he's a frog.
3491680	3492680	You should be C-Frog.
3492680	3497400	I'm thinking more like PC oriented games, you know, because this is all about PC.
3497400	3498400	GLaDOS.
3498400	3500200	Oh, GLaDOS would be a good one.
3500200	3501400	That would be a great one.
3501400	3503800	All you have is the poker sphere.
3503800	3507040	Um, maybe the chick from Mirror's Edge.
3507040	3509400	I could see, you know, EA and Steam have a close relationship.
3509400	3517440	And one of the unicorns from that stupid game on Steam.
3517440	3518920	The pink honest game.
3518920	3519920	Yeah.
3519920	3520920	Yeah.
3520920	3526560	Or what is, if you're talking PC, you know, how about an orc and a night elf?
3526560	3530800	Although, you know, typically Blizzard doesn't do anything with Steam because they can do
3530800	3531800	their own thing.
3531800	3533800	Or Rinky trying to swiddle everyone other money.
3533800	3537960	Retertainment says Lady Gaga should just be a character in the poker game.
3537960	3539760	Completely off topic, Rob.
3539760	3541720	She can show her puh-puh-puh poker face.
3541720	3543880	Did you see the link that I put up on Facebook?
3543880	3544880	No.
3544880	3548520	Someone making Para Para dances to Lady Gaga.
3548520	3550240	Some people have too much time on their hands.
3550240	3554440	It was actually kind of good, but I put it up there and you didn't even look.
3554440	3555440	I'm sorry.
3555440	3556440	When did you put it up?
3556440	3557440	Yesterday.
3557440	3558560	Well, I've been busy the past couple days.
3558560	3560760	I was, I was busy sleeping yesterday.
3560760	3561840	I'll have you know.
3561840	3562840	You hoe.
3562840	3563840	Two naps.
3563840	3564840	Yeah.
3564840	3566840	What's this, Alan?
3566840	3569480	Rob took two naps yesterday.
3569480	3570480	Two two-hour naps.
3570480	3571480	An old man.
3571480	3572480	He's very cute.
3572480	3573480	Shut up.
3573480	3574480	Don't judge me.
3574480	3575480	Oh, Jay Dizzle.
3575480	3576480	Perfect answer.
3576480	3579480	Duke Nukem should be in the game.
3579480	3580480	Hello?
3580480	3582480	Because, you know, it's going to be a big release coming up.
3582480	3583480	I like that answer.
3583480	3584480	All right.
3584480	3588120	Anyhow, let's move on and talk about more gaming news.
3588120	3591640	These dates coming up in just a moment, but first, Dark Sakura has something for us.
3591640	3594720	Mine's not really so much of a story, so much as an impression.
3594720	3600800	The new screen caps for the Mortal Kombat game that's coming out are up and it looks
3600800	3601800	really fun.
3601800	3606080	You know, I was talking to somebody that was at the GameStop Managers Conference they were
3606080	3608520	showing this game and I was hearing a lot of good things about it.
3608520	3609520	Here's my thing.
3609520	3612360	I thought that the new Mortal Kombat game was supposed to be an arcade game.
3612360	3616600	At least that was the impression I got when I first saw it, but like very much no at this
3616600	3617600	point, right?
3617600	3621800	It is definitely looking like a full $60 retail release, correct?
3621800	3622800	Yeah.
3622800	3623800	That's what the word is.
3623800	3628840	I mean, it's just, but I'm looking really at what I'm telling just from the images and
3628840	3633520	it seems to me like, like there's this one scene in here with Katana, let me find her,
3633520	3637280	where she's just covered in blood and it's fantastic.
3637280	3645560	And you're like, and Melina has her horrible, ugly eat your face face and everything just
3645560	3652600	looks like what Mortal Kombat used to be except for being, you know, 3D instead of being,
3652600	3654920	you know, the motion cap.
3654920	3659000	Like I'm not gonna lie, Mortal Kombat is one of those games that I really shouldn't like,
3659000	3660000	but I do.
3660000	3664520	Like, I really like the Mortal Kombat series and I'm really excited for this game.
3664520	3667880	And I'm, you know what, there's just some guilty pleasure games and Mortal Kombat is
3667880	3668880	one of them.
3668880	3674160	To be fair, I didn't play the DC Universe game, but I played pretty much all the others.
3674160	3680200	I really enjoyed the first couple, what was it, Deception and there was another one in
3680200	3681200	there too.
3681200	3684760	Not the last one they did with all the, thank you, Deadly Alliance.
3684760	3686000	That was actually a decent game.
3686000	3687000	Deadly Alliance is awesome.
3687000	3688880	I love the little RPG thing in there.
3688880	3692200	Yeah, you know, even those mini modes, some of them were kind of stupid, like in Deception
3692200	3695640	they had the kart racing and stuff, which were definitely an afterthought, but I ate
3695640	3696640	that shit up.
3696640	3697640	I thought it was awesome.
3697640	3701920	I'm totally digging this particular level on this picture with the big colosseum.
3701920	3702920	That looks cool.
3702920	3707160	I have another one here that's inside of a clock tower.
3707160	3709880	Oh, you know someone's getting thrown through that clock.
3709880	3712600	Well, not just through the clock, I'm thinking that they're going to get ground up by the
3712600	3713600	gears.
3713600	3714600	Awesome.
3714600	3715600	And that would be fantastic.
3715600	3720160	I want there to be special stage fatalities for every stage.
3720160	3721160	I hope so.
3721160	3722160	Because I want more blood.
3722160	3727760	It sounds like these new IP owners, what Warner Brothers is taking care of this now after
3727760	3731040	Midway, although a lot of the people that used to be involved are involved now, it really
3731040	3733400	sounds like they're just like, okay.
3733400	3735600	After that DC- They interviewed Ed Boon about it a few months
3735600	3736600	ago.
3736600	3737600	Yeah.
3737600	3740600	After that DC Universe game, let's just give the fans what they want.
3740600	3742840	Let's just go balls to the wall.
3742840	3748240	We want like a Street Fighter 4-esque type of upgrade, like, cause you know, Street Fighter
3748240	3752200	4 was like a fucking awesome upgrade from, you know, old school Street Fighter.
3752200	3754880	So like, I think that's what they're going to give us with this new Mortal Kombat game.
3754880	3760480	I'm looking at this red guy here and he's throwing the scorpion little chain thing.
3760480	3765520	Is that Ermac, or is that the ninja from Deadly Alliance, whatever his name was?
3765520	3766520	I can't remember his name.
3766520	3769200	I don't know, but there's another thing that I wouldn't mind seeing.
3769200	3770200	I think he's Ermac.
3770200	3774680	You remember Soul Calibers create a fighter thing and that you can create certain ones
3774680	3776800	that have actually a story to it?
3776800	3781500	I think that would be- It's a little hit and miss with me because
3781500	3786740	like in that one, the last Xbox game they did that let you do that, it was a little
3786740	3787740	bit janky.
3787740	3789400	Like it just was too much at that point.
3789400	3790400	It was too much.
3790400	3796120	It was just reptile, spitting, splashy, acid vomit.
3796120	3798320	They do a pretty good job on the Soul Caliber games though.
3798320	3799320	I will give you that.
3799320	3802680	Like probably my second favorite series of fighting games behind Mortal Kombat, and yes,
3802680	3805280	even above Street Fighter, is Soul Caliber.
3805280	3810740	Like those games are really bad ass and I'm really waiting for news on Soul Caliber 5.
3810740	3814560	Like I'm kind of sitting here going, okay, it's about time to hear about Soul Caliber
3814560	3817400	5 because, you know, the Yoda and Darth Vader days have long passed.
3817400	3819640	So I'd like to know what's up with that.
3819640	3821600	Where's like the robot dude?
3821600	3822600	Cyrax.
3822600	3826640	So I like that they've pulled a lot of the stuff that people liked from the other series.
3826640	3829120	I've actually got high hopes for this.
3829120	3832680	For any of our friends though that are at PAX, I want to hear what you think about it.
3832680	3837080	I'm liking that it looks like a lot of the roster from Mortal Kombat 3, except they kind
3837080	3841820	of, at least so far, looks like they've said sia to a lot of the characters that just really
3841820	3843200	weren't notable out of those games.
3843200	3844200	Like Stryker.
3844200	3845200	Like, you know, who- I liked him.
3845200	3846200	Who played Stryker?
3846200	3847200	Oh, come on.
3847200	3848200	I did play him actually.
3848200	3849200	Oh, come on.
3849200	3850200	He was-
3850200	3854000	If you knew how to use him right, he was really, really awesome.
3854000	3857960	And he had that particular- he had this like one punch combo that was super sweet.
3857960	3858960	I will say-
3858960	3859960	In Mortal Kombat 3.
3859960	3860960	I loved Kabal.
3860960	3862280	I did- I played Kabal.
3862280	3863280	He was awesome.
3863280	3868040	And I don't think he's really coming back because he wasn't really notable in the mythology-
3868040	3869280	He had the run thing.
3869280	3870920	Yeah, that was cheap.
3870920	3872560	And I loved Sindel.
3872560	3873560	I loved Sindel.
3873560	3877480	Sindel was badass, but again, what was she really there to do?
3877480	3881480	She was there to be the one dude's wife and then she kind of disappears.
3881480	3884920	Like she didn't really- or no, she's Katana's mom though, isn't she?
3884920	3885920	I think so.
3885920	3888400	And the other one was the Goro chick.
3888400	3890960	Yeah, she- I didn't care for her.
3890960	3891960	What?
3891960	3892960	Shiva.
3892960	3893960	That was it.
3893960	3894960	I didn't care for her.
3894960	3895960	Like, oh, what a derivative name that is.
3895960	3896960	Yeah.
3896960	3899240	But I really like Sindel and her scream thing.
3899240	3903560	But yeah, so I mean, and really, like I said, it's not exactly a story.
3903560	3907040	And if anyone wants to see the images, just go to Eurogamer.net.
3907040	3911840	But they're really- I'm actually excited about a Mortal Kombat game.
3911840	3916120	Vidpower in our chatroom says, Striker is the Dan of the Mortal Kombat universe.
3916120	3920360	Hey, if you can win a game with Dan, you're pretty awesome, right?
3920360	3922480	Nice, I like that.
3922480	3927620	Derek H. in our chatroom, by the way, I neglected to say this last week on the show, and I really
3927620	3931620	need to give a big holler and thank you to Derek H. for the big battle which wrapped
3931620	3933340	up last week.
3933340	3936760	Even though we got our butts kicked by the host country, Dead Picks Alive, you know how
3936760	3938840	that usually happens in the Olympics?
3938840	3942400	The host country usually wins, and Dead Picks Alive won.
3942400	3945440	We made a really good job second place, so thank you to all the listeners who helped
3945440	3946440	out in the big battle there.
3946440	3949000	And I just want to give kudos to Derek for putting that all together, because I know
3949000	3952440	it's a pain in the ass to do those types of large-scale tournaments.
3952440	3958360	Hence why we don't do them a lot anymore, so good job to him, appreciate it.
3958360	3962780	He says in our chatroom, that's the defense of everyone who likes crappy characters.
3962780	3964840	If you know how to use them, he's great.
3964840	3966920	I do the same thing with Cammie.
3966920	3970440	Cammie's actually a good character too.
3970440	3972240	Uh-oh, Alan?
3972240	3976240	Just like, his eyes got really big, and he's looking like, I'm gonna cut this bitch.
3976240	3977240	Dan hates Cammie.
3977240	3978240	Dan hates Cammie.
3978240	3979240	Dan Jelly from the other room.
3979240	3980880	Okay, so you like Cammie, right?
3980880	3982880	Yes, yes, she's amazing.
3982880	3987920	And my favorite thing that she does is the little mid-air combos where she spins and
3987920	3989920	then goes into a different kick or a punch or something.
3989920	3992040	What were they called, the hooligan combos, I think?
3992040	3993480	Here's my thing with Cammie.
3993480	3998360	I like her as a character, and you know Kylie Minogue playing her in the movie was the best
3998360	3999360	thing ever.
3999360	4000920	That was the only good thing about the movie.
4000920	4006280	Like I like her as a character, but as a street fighter, god I hate her.
4006280	4009400	Like she's just, she's so useless.
4009400	4012480	Actually no, I take that back, T-Hawk is probably the most useless street fighter.
4012480	4013480	T-Hawk actually-
4013480	4015240	She just has a nice ass, that's about it.
4015240	4017400	They drew her with a nice ass.
4017400	4019700	That's really the only addition to her.
4019700	4021560	This is my thing.
4021560	4025720	It doesn't matter how much someone says a character sucks, if you enjoy playing them
4025720	4029280	and you're good at them, everybody else better watch out.
4029280	4033740	That is the, that's the trash talking roots of the gaming universe, you know?
4033740	4037960	What you believe to be true is law and everybody else is stupid.
4037960	4038960	That's really what-
4038960	4043400	And I think everybody can agree that she would probably look better naked than T-Hawk anyways,
4043400	4044400	so yeah.
4044400	4048080	T-Hawk would be disproportionate if he actually didn't have clothes on.
4048080	4049080	Anyway.
4049080	4050080	No penis.
4050080	4057720	Anyway, but the whole, the whole point is, you know, it's just like with video games,
4057720	4058720	you know?
4058720	4062520	The game's only as good as the system, you know, they're on, well I mean, not the system
4062520	4063520	they're on.
4063520	4064520	A game-
4064520	4066400	A system is only as good as the games that are on it.
4066400	4070520	Well then a character is only as good as the player playing.
4070520	4076040	Yeah, take my cami bashing with a grain of salt because I love Faye Long.
4076040	4079080	Like he's my favorite character in Street Fighter.
4079080	4081080	I think he's badass.
4081080	4084920	I enjoy playing Sakura, but that's just because she's fun because she does her little hop
4084920	4085920	thing.
4085920	4086920	You playing Sakura?
4086920	4089520	Karin was really good.
4089520	4093680	One of my favorite characters in the Alpha series that made it into four that really
4093680	4097280	just does not play well in four at all is Rose.
4097280	4101320	She is amazing, but she's really hard to play and crap in four.
4101320	4102320	But cami is awesome.
4102320	4106240	I'll kick your ass as cami.
4106240	4111600	I remember what my old Let's Piss Off Dan team was, was Gambit and cami.
4111600	4112600	Good times.
4112600	4114320	In X-Men vs. Street Fighter when we first got together.
4114320	4116840	Can't wait for the new Marvel vs. Capcom game, it's gonna be good times.
4116840	4118840	Dan, look at the Saturn!
4118840	4119840	Alright.
4119840	4123920	Alright, anyhow, let's move on to some release dates, traveling the world after our little
4123920	4126640	fighting game derailment there, that's alright.
4126640	4127640	Let's travel the world and talk about-
4127640	4128880	Hey, we've got time to fill.
4128880	4132000	That's true, we do have lots of time to fill, although I know, I don't know what time Loki
4132000	4135120	has to go, but we'll figure it out.
4135120	4137120	So, release dates, Loki.
4137120	4139880	Yes, there's some decent stuff coming out this week.
4139880	4145480	It's starting to ramp up a little bit because we're getting into the long fourth quarter.
4145480	4150880	So starting things off, Batman the Brave and the Bold on Wii and DS this week.
4150880	4157320	Spider-Man Shattered Dimensions on Playstation 3, Xbox 360, Wii and DS.
4157320	4163480	Tom Clancy's Hawks 2 on Playstation 3, Xbox 360.
4163480	4168720	And the Wii version comes out later, if that's right.
4168720	4174160	Oddly enough, if you really want to buy games before you can actually play them, there's
4174160	4178680	some Playstation Move games coming out this week, including iPad.
4178680	4183000	Unfortunately, since the Move doesn't come out for a couple weeks, you can stare at the
4183000	4185480	nice little case for a while.
4185480	4188040	That'll be available on Playstation 3.
4188040	4192280	NHL 11 on Playstation 3, Xbox 360.
4192280	4198400	Midnight Mysteries, the Edgar Allen Poe conspiracy on Nintendo DS.
4198400	4199400	Kingdom Hearts.
4199400	4204440	I will be buying that game, quote the raven, nevermore.
4204440	4208000	Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep coming out on the PSP.
4208000	4210000	No PSP Go, though.
4210000	4211000	Do you want?
4211000	4217240	NHL Slap Shot, that's the crappy Wii game with the hockey stick controller.
4217240	4221320	Yeah, you're not going to break a TV with that.
4221320	4222320	Sports Champions.
4222320	4223320	That's the fun part.
4223320	4227840	When you're at your friend's house and he beats you in NHL, whatever, whatever, and
4227840	4230920	he's like, yeah, hi, beat you, you suck.
4230920	4234620	You can just start bashing the TV in with your controller saying, huh, well I fucked
4234620	4237280	up your TV, later, bitch.
4237280	4242840	Sports Champions, the Wii Sports type game for the Playstation Move.
4242840	4247440	Once again, this will make a nice coaster for the next two weeks.
4247440	4249440	Saints Row Double Pack.
4249440	4255800	That's a re-release of the two Saints Row games on Xbox 360 for only $29.99.
4255800	4261520	There's also a, let's see here, Brunswick Cosmic Bowling game, which I'm sure is not
4261520	4264840	terrible at all on the Wii.
4264840	4271320	Rooz, it's the real-time strategy game that you can bluff in on Xbox 360 and Playstation
4271320	4272320	3.
4272320	4276120	And Assault on Balleria.
4276120	4280040	Looks like that's how you pronounce that, I probably fucked that up.
4280040	4282560	That's on PC.
4282560	4283560	Start the Party.
4283560	4288880	It's going to be a real party in your house when you're staring at this Blu-ray case,
4288880	4292200	and that's on the PS3.
4292200	4293540	What is it?
4293540	4295900	How do you start the party?
4295900	4300120	Start the party by buying the party supplies in preparation for two weeks.
4300120	4301760	What is this fucking game, Loki?
4301760	4302760	What are you doing?
4302760	4303760	It is a cr- okay.
4303760	4304760	You know Itoy Play?
4304760	4305760	Okay.
4305760	4309680	Let's do that, but now with the Playstation Move controller.
4309680	4311000	It's Start the Party.
4311000	4312000	Kung Fu Rider.
4312000	4314000	Press start to party.
4314000	4318640	Kung Fu Rider, a game so terrible it's actually probably more fun to stare at the case than
4318640	4320200	actually play it.
4320200	4324920	That'll be coming out as well on the Playstation 3 this week.
4324920	4325920	Photo World.
4325920	4332000	It's a game where you take photos with a DSI camera, and yes, it's a DSI-only game.
4332000	4333000	That's awesome.
4333000	4336480	That's stuff that I, I don't know, I could do without the game, with the game.
4336480	4340560	That sounds more useful than Ping Pals on the DS.
4340560	4342560	Yeah, almost.
4342560	4345800	The Sims 3 Fast Lane stuff.
4345800	4347380	I gotta read this in our chatroom.
4347380	4350600	First off, I gotta catch up on some chat comments, because the chat's starting to fill up here.
4350600	4351960	Thanks to you guys for tuning in early.
4351960	4352960	We really appreciate it.
4352960	4354720	There's quite a few of you here tonight, so thank you guys.
4354720	4355720	Chat.orangestimesradio.com.
4355720	4360640	Let's see, where was the, there was, oh yeah, I wanted to say this about Rose.
4360640	4364480	Derek H., who brought up Cammy in the first place, actually says, I destroy people with
4364480	4365480	Rose.
4365480	4366480	Destroy.
4366480	4367480	So there you go.
4367480	4369080	Illusion spark, bitches.
4369080	4372080	So it looks like you and Derek have a lot in common, because you're both Cammy and Rose
4372080	4373080	players.
4373080	4374080	Let's see.
4374080	4375080	Where was I?
4375080	4377120	Say, oh yeah, start the party.
4377120	4378720	Redertainment says start the party.
4378720	4381800	Gin, vodka, and hot women not included.
4381800	4382800	Or fun.
4382800	4385040	I do have, I do have vodka and tequila.
4385040	4386040	Do you?
4386040	4387040	Yes, do you want some?
4387040	4388040	Yeah.
4388040	4389040	We're gonna start the party right now.
4389040	4392880	Seriously, I need you, I need everyone to drink up my booze.
4392880	4395480	I'll have a little bit, but keep in mind, I gotta drive home when this is all over,
4395480	4396480	so I'll get.
4396480	4397480	You've got hours to get sober.
4397480	4400800	I'll have a drink or two, well I could also run out and get dinner at some point, so I'll
4400800	4401800	have like a beer.
4401800	4402800	Do you have a Guinness?
4402800	4403800	I want a Guinness.
4403800	4404800	No, I don't have a Guinness.
4404800	4405800	I have two New Castles left.
4405800	4407360	Oh, New Castle, New Castle, New Castle, New Castle.
4407360	4408360	Humor Games this week.
4408360	4409360	You can have a New Castle.
4409360	4410360	Yay, thank you.
4410360	4411360	Oh, sorry.
4411360	4417840	UFC Undisputed 2010 on PSP, Prison Tycoon, Alcatraz, once again delayed, thank you value
4417840	4420560	soft for not being able to hit your damn street dates.
4420560	4426640	Dawn of Heroes on DS, speaking of delayed games, that'll be coming out this week, maybe.
4426640	4433560	King's Bounty Armored Princess, not sure what that is, but yeah, it's on PC.
4433560	4440200	And finally, Professor Layton and the Unwound Future on Nintendo DS, that comes out one
4440200	4443240	week from today.
4443240	4444240	That is it.
4444240	4445240	Alright.
4445240	4449720	Let's move on, talk about Japanese release dates, looking at what's coming out in Japan.
4449720	4456680	Starting off with the Xbox 360 on September 9th, UFC Undisputed 2010 is coming out on
4456680	4459920	the Xbox 360, for those that are into that.
4459920	4465880	Excuse me, I'm moving on to the PlayStation 3 and checking out what's coming out over
4465880	4466880	there.
4466880	4468480	If I can find it.
4468480	4469480	There we go.
4469480	4473240	Split Second gets its Japanese release this week on the PlayStation 3.
4473240	4475880	Also UFC Undisputed 2010 gets a release there, too.
4475880	4480040	By the way, next week, Front Mission Evolved, just so you know, that's on the 16th, but
4480040	4482800	I wanted to get that out there because I know there's a lot of Front Mission fans.
4482800	4485760	It's kind of a cultish type of game.
4485760	4490920	Looking at the Wii and what's coming out on the Wii, we have Okami getting a price cut
4490920	4492520	this week on the Wii.
4492520	4499280	Biohazard 4 is also getting a price cut and the Biohazard Chronicles, that of course is
4499280	4503120	Resident Evil, what they call that series over there is Biohazard.
4503120	4509840	Looking at the handheld systems on the Nintendo DS, One Piece Gigant Battle from Bandai Namco
4509840	4511600	is coming out on the DS this week.
4511600	4515120	I have no idea what that game is all about, but I'm assuming it's going to be a giant
4515120	4516360	battle.
4516360	4524920	And then on the PSP, Sengoku Efuda Yugi Hototosigusu Tyran comes out this week from iRAM.
4524920	4528160	I have no idea what this game is, I'm trying to look at this real quick.
4528160	4529880	This sounds interesting.
4529880	4537040	It is a board game, it's a port of a board game I guess that's popular in Japan.
4537040	4539800	Although this is not one I have ever seen before, I don't think it's chess or anything
4539800	4540800	like that.
4540800	4545440	Looks like it's a card slash board fusion type of game, so that might be interesting.
4545440	4548240	That's coming out on the PSP this next week.
4548240	4552020	And then Vitamin X Evolution Plus is also coming out this week.
4552020	4554200	That's what it's called.
4554200	4558120	So there you go, kind of a slow week in Japan, but just like we are, they're ramping up for
4558120	4559620	Christmas.
4559620	4563300	Although of course Halo is thrown in there to kind of liven things up this month.
4563300	4565040	They get Halo next week, just so you know.
4565040	4567360	Dark Sakura, what's coming out in Europe?
4567360	4572760	On the 6th we have Chime for PC, and then the 7th is Dragon Age Origins Witch Hunt and
4572760	4575600	Mass Effect 2, Lair of the Shadow Broker.
4575600	4582040	And on the 8th we have Amnesia, The Dark Descent, and Plants vs. Zombies, which is crack.
4582040	4589240	And then on the 10th we have Ace Combat Joint Assault, Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, and
4589240	4597200	Tom Clancy's Hawks 2, which, I don't know, I'm still kind of giddy about Birth by Sleep.
4597200	4599240	But this Amnesia thing sounds kind of interesting.
4599240	4605940	I was looking up a little bit about it too, that I think it would be interesting to see
4605940	4608040	that one, but...
4608040	4609040	Is that coming out?
4609040	4610040	Amnesia?
4610040	4611040	Amnesia.
4611040	4613080	The Dark Descent.
4613080	4615120	It's from Frictional Games.
4615120	4616120	Nope.
4616120	4622280	If it does it will be ported over by Zoo Games, because they love taking European releases
4622280	4624320	and bringing them out over here, eventually.
4624320	4625320	Eventually.
4625320	4630080	After they delayed them for months and months and months and months and months and months
4630080	4631480	and months and months and months.
4631480	4633720	But Plants vs. Zombies, that game is kind of crack.
4633720	4634720	I mean...
4634720	4639680	I'm actually looking, see, I'm looking forward to downloading that on the iPod when it comes
4639680	4640680	in.
4640680	4642200	Supposed to get it next week, because they're not yet released.
4642200	4645360	It's supposed to be out on DS in January.
4645360	4646360	Yes.
4646360	4647360	Yes.
4647360	4648360	So...
4648360	4654080	But, you know, me being kind of a noob to the whole app store and stuff, I'm very pleased
4654080	4655880	that they're not that expensive.
4655880	4663720	Except I was actually shopping for something to use as like a Garmin or, you know, some
4663720	4665080	sort of GPS thing.
4665080	4670720	To add GPS to the iPod Touch is ridiculously expensive.
4670720	4673440	Like I believe it's a TomTom adapter.
4673440	4677720	They have, it's $79.99 just for the GPS adapter.
4677720	4680760	Then they want you to pay another $40 for the fucking app.
4680760	4684760	To which I gave them the big middle finger and said, fuck you, I will just look up directions
4684760	4689080	on Google Maps and I'm smart enough as a human being to figure out how to get there.
4689080	4694000	I do not need you to tell me how to get there for $120, you know, almost $120.
4694000	4695000	Yeah.
4695000	4699800	I better be getting free blowjobs for $120 from that thing, you know.
4699800	4702600	It's just, it's not worth it.
4702600	4709120	And honestly, I mean, if you've got, you may as well just use Google Maps because seriously,
4709120	4712080	it's kind of like irritating I think when you have the speaking GPS.
4712080	4713080	Yeah.
4713080	4718240	I am going to get though, I want to get one of these Virgin Mobile MiFi 2200s.
4718240	4722680	Now I know that the MiFi 2200 is actually available through a bunch of different, like
4722680	4724440	Verizon and Sprint and stuff like that.
4724440	4727720	But they're way more expensive and you have to have a contract.
4727720	4730180	So I'm cheap.
4730180	4736180	And sometimes I don't want to pay my bills, so this is perfect.
4736180	4737680	I heard about those devices.
4737680	4738800	I kind of want to get one.
4738800	4739800	I'm serious.
4739800	4741800	I'm getting one for, we could do it for podcasting.
4741800	4743360	You can connect with the five devices.
4743360	4745680	We can do like podcasting anywhere.
4745680	4750720	Plus, I'm just going to shove it in my pocket and I can use my iPod touch like, you know,
4750720	4751720	like a phone basically.
4751720	4756800	I would worry about podcasting over 3G though because we skip enough on this stream as it
4756800	4757800	is.
4757800	4762280	At least not, it's like an average DSL connection.
4762280	4766040	It's not horrible as long as you're in a decent area.
4766040	4769320	But I mean, I don't know.
4769320	4771920	I wouldn't exactly use it for podcasting all the time.
4771920	4775760	Maybe just surfing the web while I'm out there.
4775760	4780520	I like the iPhone as far as surfing the web and stuff, but I don't want to pay the fees
4780520	4781700	each month for it.
4781700	4786480	And also, you know, I don't really need the phone stuff too much.
4786480	4790240	I use maybe, if I'm lucky, 30 minutes a month.
4790240	4794240	So all these cell phone plans are way too expensive for what they give me.
4794240	4798120	Although I have been looking at, they've been advertising the new Virgin Mobile ones too
4798120	4800280	for $25 a month for everything.
4800280	4802400	I don't like the phones for that.
4802400	4803400	That's the only bad thing.
4803400	4808320	If it was like, you know, an iPhone for $25 a month, then I'd be all over that shit.
4808320	4814900	Anyway, sorry, I'm not trying to sound like a peddler for Virgin Mobile.
4814900	4820720	So let's talk about the PlayStation 3 and all sorts of weird stuff going on in the mod
4820720	4822600	ship world there.
4822600	4829800	You may remember the PlayStation Jailbreak was announced last week, and of course, you
4829800	4835560	know, for a very expensive hundred and, I don't remember how much it was, $70 or something
4835560	4837040	like that for it.
4837040	4842080	Well, funny enough, you know, there was a temporary injunction placed on them last week
4842080	4844960	where they were prevented from selling it until the 31st.
4844960	4850520	Then the 31st rolled around, and they were delayed until Friday, and on Friday, Sony
4850520	4857640	actually won the court case, so they had prevented them, OZ mod chips, and actually any of the
4857640	4863560	mod chip manufacturers or resellers in Australia from selling the devices.
4863560	4870900	And so they were, you know, basically prevented from selling everything, and they had been
4870900	4873240	taking the court and all that stuff.
4873240	4877120	So everyone that bought one had their money returned, which is awesome, because at the
4877120	4881540	same time, you know, the people that may have been buying them from OZ mod chips or even
4881540	4888820	in the U.S., now Sony is going after the U.S. manufacturers, or I should say resellers.
4888820	4899400	They're going against Zumba LDC, whose website ShopsJailbreak.com has been selling a new
4899400	4906680	PS3 Jailbreak mod chips for their very expensive price of like $100 and some dollars.
4906680	4908060	So they're going after them now.
4908060	4913280	But all of that doesn't really matter, because people have already cloned the PlayStation
4913280	4921560	Jailbreak with a device called the PS Groove, and the PS Groove basically is an open source
4921560	4929720	mod chip that runs off of a Teensy++ USB development board or an AT90 USB key.
4929720	4932340	Both of those run under $30 some dollars.
4932340	4941120	It's $24 for the one and about $31 for the other, which is a lot cheaper than, you know,
4941120	4943000	$100 and some dollars.
4943000	4947960	And what's great about that is, you know, the part that kind of pissed off Sony with
4947960	4952120	the whole backup manager, they actually have disabled the backup manager, but then of course
4952120	4956280	people have released modified versions that have the backup manager in there again.
4956280	4959440	But it is a solution that is now widely available.
4959440	4967360	So Sony, you know, by snipping this other one in the butt, kind of made themselves a
4967360	4968860	bigger problem.
4968860	4975640	And so now they're actually porting the PlayStation Groove to the PSP, which will run as an application
4975640	4980000	on there on a Homebrew firmware.
4980000	4986160	So you'll actually be able to use your PSP for free to mod your PlayStation 3 if you
4986160	4987160	have that.
4987160	4992480	Or if you can't wait for that to come out and you happen to have a Nokia N900, you can
4992480	4995200	actually do that for free now.
4995200	5001760	And you can connect that to your PlayStation 3 using the special port of the PlayStation
5001760	5007040	Groove to crack your system, so that sucks.
5007040	5009880	It's something that I don't know if they're going to be able to patch out.
5009880	5013400	It's definitely, if you're using the backup manager, there's ways to tell that you're
5013400	5014400	doing it.
5014400	5018520	But they're working on ways now to basically make it stealth.
5018520	5023740	They've taken the device ID, because each game has like an ID code to it, and so they
5023740	5026080	can tell what game you're playing.
5026080	5029960	Well, the stealth version of it, which isn't entirely stealth yet, because they haven't
5029960	5034640	erased all the old ID code out of it, is making the game look like, or making it look like
5034640	5038400	you're playing a copy of Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2, which a lot of people out there
5038400	5042000	are, so it would be hard to track them down.
5042000	5043960	But it's only going to get worse for them now.
5043960	5048680	Because once you have this system out now to actually mod your system, people are going
5048680	5052440	to find out ways to do custom firmwares, and it only goes from there.
5052440	5055800	It's just going to snowball.
5055800	5057760	Is there anything Sony can do about all this?
5057760	5059040	I don't know if they can.
5059040	5066240	I mean, other than maybe they can fix the hack, but apparently from what I was reading
5066240	5075280	though, the way that this exploit is done is actually before the firmware, so to patch
5075280	5078560	it with the firmware might be impossible.
5078560	5083320	It's before the firmware actually kicks in, so it's impossible maybe to do that, but they
5083320	5088840	may be able to block the ID for the backup manager or something like that, but they're
5088840	5093360	just going to, if it's that easy to change the game ID on the backup manager, that won't
5093360	5097280	really be an issue, because they can just keep changing it to keep dodging any blocks
5097280	5099220	that they put in place.
5099220	5105800	So it'll be interesting, and definitely they're going to be doing another update soon for
5105800	5110640	either PlayStation Move stuff, I know they already have that Move stuff available right
5110640	5115520	now, the firmware for that, but they're going to be doing the 3D Blu-ray stuff, and who
5115520	5118720	knows what other patches later on.
5118720	5121480	They're going to try to patch it, that's for sure, but I have a feeling it's going to go
5121480	5124040	back and forth, just like the whole PSP stuff.
5124040	5127320	But you won't be able to play online with this, right?
5127320	5129560	They'll be able to get that, right?
5129560	5133280	As of right now, see here's the thing with the online.
5133280	5137920	See that's the issue with playing with the backup manager, because it shows that ID code,
5137920	5142400	and they can go, okay, this person's playing online with this ID code, okay they're using
5142400	5145760	the backup manager, bam, we bam their console.
5145760	5150080	But they're changing it to mimic Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2, it'll look like, oh they're
5150080	5155680	playing Modern Warfare 2, and then they're not going to ban them.
5155680	5161440	So if they successfully masked the backup manager to make it look like Modern Warfare
5161440	5166320	2, then there really is nothing they can do as far as detecting which console's running
5166320	5169280	this backup manager.
5169280	5171080	So it's going to be tough.
5171080	5174200	Alright, well we'll see what develops.
5174200	5178960	I'm kind of curious to see how Sony's long-term strategy of this plays out, because it's kind
5178960	5181760	of like, yeah they can try and stop this with the court orders and everything, but once
5181760	5184080	the technology's out there, it's out there, you know what I mean, it's going to be very
5184080	5186500	hard to stop, especially when they're telling people how to make their own.
5186500	5194480	And they're already starting to dump games too, so the whole scene now, because the hard
5194480	5199000	drives, you don't even really have to do too much, you just can copy the files straight
5199000	5204320	to your hard drive, and people are just doing Blu-Ray dumps.
5204320	5208080	Would Spaznator be able to use this to get his videos to work when Sony keeps screwing
5208080	5210880	them over with the whole console and all that?
5210880	5211880	I don't know.
5211880	5213880	I mean, I don't know.
5213880	5218560	Alright, let's see, Brakeman in our chat room says, so people hacked a Sony system, isn't
5218560	5219960	that business as usual with Sony?
5219960	5220960	Not for the PS3.
5220960	5222560	Yeah, not for the PS3.
5222560	5227720	I mean, they really kind of rolled this out as unhackable, and for a while it certainly
5227720	5231740	seemed that way, although we all knew in the back of our heads somebody would hack it eventually,
5231740	5232960	so it's finally coming around.
5232960	5236440	But with the fact that Blu-Ray hasn't really been easily adopted into burning and all that
5236440	5242720	yet, it's still got a ways to go, I think, before you're going to see mass market piracy
5242720	5243720	for this.
5243720	5244720	Yeah, I don't know.
5244720	5250400	But they keep claiming piracy killed the PSP, but I don't know, I have mixed feelings on
5250400	5251400	that.
5251400	5252400	I don't think it's totally right.
5252400	5254840	It's a good scapegoat, because they don't really, it's hard to tell what the numbers
5254840	5261480	are actually on that, but I'm sure it contributed to it, but then again, look at the Nintendo
5261480	5262480	DS.
5262480	5269400	I mean, that system is doing really well, and I know piracy has affected that, but it's
5269400	5273120	hard to say, and I don't know.
5273120	5279720	It'll be interesting to see what happens, but I don't know, it'll just be fun to play
5279720	5281840	around with, I think.
5281840	5282840	All right.
5282840	5290800	Well, let's move on to another story about the Xbox 360 this time, and some price changes
5290800	5292200	going on in the 360.
5292200	5294600	This was news that came out this week.
5294600	5301800	A one month gold subscription to Xbox Live is going up, starting November 1st, $8 to
5301800	5302800	$10.
5302800	5303800	That's good.
5303800	5312400	Three months going up from $20 to $25, and a full year of Xbox Live up $50 to $60.
5312400	5317480	Of course, that's really $49.99 to $59, but it's $50 to $60.
5317480	5319840	I'm throwing in that extra penny there.
5319840	5323640	The price of Xbox Live has gone up, folks, but what's interesting about this story, it's
5323640	5326960	the first time we've ever had this story in the history of our show, which has been going
5326960	5328800	about as long as Xbox Live has.
5328800	5332540	They haven't raised the price in the years that it's been active.
5332540	5334520	Is it justified that they raise the price now?
5334520	5336680	What do you guys think?
5336680	5339240	I kind of thought it was about time.
5339240	5347780	I mean, you've got to keep up with the market, and if you're not making enough to match cost
5347780	5353160	and still have the right profit margin they're expecting, then I don't see why not.
5353160	5356360	By the way, if you're worried about this price increase, there are some ways you can lock
5356360	5357360	in the old price.
5357360	5363720	You can do a renewal of one year through Xbox.com right now for $40, or you can also buy some
5363720	5368300	of those prepaid cards right now with the lower prices, because you can still find those
5368300	5369640	for the old prices.
5369640	5373520	If you load up on a couple of those, then you'll be locked in for however much time.
5373520	5378680	Dude, it's seriously like 80 some cents more a month.
5378680	5383800	That's what it is, average out, and honestly, $10 more, yeah, that is more money for you
5383800	5389380	to pay, but look at what the hell, download content and your Xbox Live arcade games cost
5389380	5390380	that much.
5390380	5393800	I understand that everybody's cash strapped nowadays with the economy and everything,
5393800	5395800	but come on.
5395800	5400600	Eat one less lunch out or something, I mean, stop fucking bitching about $10.
5400600	5404720	It's not like the price is doubling, and I understand that you may not use all the features,
5404720	5408840	because honestly, I don't use most of the features on Xbox Live.
5408840	5414280	I don't use Twitter, I don't use Facebook, none of the extra stuff, and the ESPN's streaming
5414280	5418320	and stuff like that, I could care less about it, and the fact that it's going up $10, it
5418320	5423040	doesn't really bother me, because so what?
5423040	5427720	Well speaking of ESPN, in our chat room, Blaze says, given that this ESPN functionality is
5427720	5431080	supposed to be absurdly amazing, that it's not that big a deal.
5431080	5435040	Breakman says, fuck you Microsoft, everyone kept asking them when Xbox Live will go free,
5435040	5438200	so they said fuck you, we'll raise the price.
5438200	5442920	I'm okay with this price hike, because they haven't done one in so long, and it does seem
5442920	5446760	like, you know, the amount of content on Xbox Live, there's a lot of it there.
5446760	5451880	I'm okay with it, you know, because we're talking on a yearly basis too.
5451880	5457020	If this is where we're going instead of the online pass, I'm okay with it.
5457020	5459540	But unfortunately, I think we all know it's not.
5459540	5465120	That online pass still exists, and to me, you can't do this and that.
5465120	5466120	You really shouldn't.
5466120	5470400	This online pass is ridiculous in the first place, but it's even more so with this.
5470400	5475360	I don't blame Microsoft for the online pass stuff, I blame the third party publishers.
5475360	5478600	Microsoft could stop it.
5478600	5481060	It's their servers, their stores, they could stop.
5481060	5482060	It's their software though.
5482060	5487160	If they want to prevent people from connecting online, they can do that.
5487160	5488160	It's their software.
5488160	5492120	I understand that they should step up and say, hey, you know, you shouldn't be doing
5492120	5496020	that kind of stuff on our service, because they made a member of everybody play nice
5496020	5501600	with the guitar controllers and stuff like that, they all had to work together.
5501600	5506240	That was kind of cool, but I think that they should step up and do that, since they have
5506240	5511600	dedicated servers for all this stuff, but once again, it's these third party companies
5511600	5514360	getting greedy with forced up.
5514360	5519440	It sets a really bad precedent though, when you have Sony doing the same thing.
5519440	5522720	Like if Microsoft said, oh, by the way, we're going to charge you $10 to play this game
5522720	5526960	online, or I'm sorry, yeah, Microsoft said, no, we're going to charge you $10 extra to
5526960	5530820	play this game online if you buy it used, then there might be some issues, but I don't
5530820	5535340	think they're going to go that route, because they're making enough money as it is on live
5535340	5542400	and maybe they try supporting it with ad revenue and stuff like that, and maybe just the cost
5542400	5549400	to run this stuff keeps going up and up, I mean, they keep adding features and stuff
5549400	5554700	to it, and maybe it's just getting more expensive, I don't know.
5554700	5559920	I really do feel the value of $50 for Xbox Live now is certainly better than it was eight
5559920	5560920	years ago.
5560920	5561920	Which is cool.
5561920	5565880	I don't think that they would just say, okay, you know what, we want to make more money,
5565880	5566880	so we're going to raise the price.
5566880	5570880	I think that they would actually say, okay, listen, because they're going to try to keep
5570880	5577320	it as low as possible to stay competitive with the PlayStation network, and I don't
5577320	5581000	see them raising prices just because, oh, we need to make more money.
5581000	5584600	I think it's just that the cost of doing things is going up.
5584600	5590760	Blaze said, remember that this online pass stuff applies to games that are multi console,
5590760	5596400	and Microsoft requires online play to go through their servers, but Sony makes third party
5596400	5598880	people run their own servers.
5598880	5605040	Well okay, but still, then put the online pass on Sony, not Microsoft.
5605040	5607480	Stop being lazy and just putting out the same code for both systems.
5607480	5611960	If people are that pissed off about a $10 price hike, then you need to spend the extra
5611960	5618280	effort it's going to take to go and find those cards for cheaper, and honestly, there are
5618280	5619280	cards out there.
5619280	5623400	There's a lot of ways to get cards for like 40 bucks now.
5623400	5624880	Go stock up on some of those.
5624880	5631160	If you're so concerned about you spend the extra 83 cents a month, seriously, go for
5631160	5636960	a walk around your local strip malls and stuff like that.
5636960	5640280	You could probably find 83 cents on the ground.
5640280	5641960	It's not that fucking expensive.
5641960	5644880	Seriously, go without a can of soda one week.
5644880	5648120	83 cents a month, let's break that down by week.
5648120	5654480	That's like 20 cents a week, come on, find a dime.
5654480	5658760	I understand that it's not that much money, but here you go, you're the devil's advocate.
5658760	5660560	It's the principle.
5660560	5665240	They're raising the price, and what are they doing to justify the raising of the price?
5665240	5669780	Well people aren't too worried about paying $60 for games.
5669780	5675280	That's a $10 price hike per game, so why aren't you just still playing your original PlayStation
5675280	5676680	2 and Xbox then?
5676680	5681560	Why aren't you boycotting all these different game systems since it's so expensive for you
5681560	5683240	to spend the extra $10?
5683240	5686920	I think you're a fucking hypocrite is what I think you are.
5686920	5691040	Break Man in our chat room says, I'll pay Microsoft an extra $10 a month to take Facebook
5691040	5692920	off my 360.
5692920	5693920	Amen to that.
5693920	5695640	Facebook on 360 is ugly.
5695640	5699320	It looks better on a cell phone, and that is saying a lot.
5699320	5703540	Anyhow, let's move on and get into the classic video game of the week.
5703540	5708280	It's a chance for us to take a trip down memory lane, where Dark Sakura will dig into the
5708280	5714380	gamer vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, you kids out there in internet land.
5714380	5715920	Get off my lawn and play this game.
5715920	5718880	Get off my lawn and go inside and play this game.
5718880	5722600	Dark Sakura, what is the classic game of the week?
5722600	5724600	X-Men for the Sega Genesis.
5724600	5726600	This game is cool.
5726600	5733360	I have to save something for the future, Rob.
5733360	5736180	Probably I think one of the best games that came on the Genesis.
5736180	5745760	It was in 1993, and it was the whole 90s era of X-Men.
5745760	5750840	The game basically starts off, we're in the danger room, and there's a virus that goes
5750840	5752040	into the danger rooms.
5752040	5756880	You have to go through different areas within the danger room, and then fight Magneto at
5756880	5757880	the end.
5757880	5767320	So you play as Gambit, or Nightcrawler, Wolverine, or Cyclops, and they have different, you know,
5767320	5771480	regular punches, kicks, whatever, and then they have their mutant power that has a dumb
5771480	5776720	power bar, and then they have the rest of their life bar.
5776720	5782040	Your bar will regenerate, and you can also switch characters in mid-level, so that helps
5782040	5784680	you save stuff off.
5784680	5792080	So yeah, with Wolverine, he basically has his big bad claws and his healing factor.
5792080	5798160	Gambit has his charged cards for a special attack, Cyclops has the optic blast, and Nightcrawler
5798160	5801200	has the ability to teleport, which is useful.
5801200	5803600	He was actually my favorite character to use in the game.
5803600	5811860	You also get Storm, Rogue, Iceman, and Archangel as sort of helpers.
5811860	5816320	You can call on them for help, and you can also get Jean Grey to pop up if you happen
5816320	5819960	to fall, and you fight different X-Men villains, so it's pretty cool.
5819960	5823480	But one of the cool things about this game, and it had a...
5823480	5829320	It broke the fourth wall.
5829320	5833860	When you defeat Mojo, you have to reset the computer in the danger room, but what it really
5833860	5838520	means is reset your machine, and the whole trick is you just sort of have to pop the
5838520	5844360	reset button, and then it'll black out and pop up these numbers like a computer rebooting,
5844360	5845760	you know, in the 90s.
5845760	5849280	So what, somebody's 486, I guess?
5849280	5854560	Anyway, um, but we had a giggle from Loki about something.
5854560	5857040	Sorry, something someone posted.
5857040	5858040	Uh...
5858040	5860040	I'm curious now.
5860040	5861720	Uh, take a right.
5861720	5864840	Can wait until after the classic game.
5864840	5869520	Um, one thing that I need to point out is that if you hit the button too hard, of course,
5869520	5872320	it will reset the game, and you're like SOL.
5872320	5879080	Or if you have a nomad, the nomad doesn't have a reset button, so you're SOL there unless
5879080	5880680	you level skip.
5880680	5887020	Um, all of the music in the game was done by Fletcher Beasley, who used the Genesis
5887020	5894960	emulation music software, and it would work with the Yamaha 2612 FM synthesizer chip on
5894960	5898680	the Genesis, so you could play the sounds back through it and you know what it sounds
5898680	5899680	like.
5899680	5900680	So it's actually got a really cool soundtrack.
5900680	5903120	I think that it sounds really good.
5903120	5909400	Um, but he's quoted as saying that he was trying to use the sound of the distorted guitar
5909400	5912800	in his tracks to make them sound edgier.
5912800	5915600	And, I mean, it's got a great soundtrack.
5915600	5916600	Kudos to him.
5916600	5918240	But it was a really cool game.
5918240	5922360	It actually, there's one level in that game that pissed me off to no end, and it was always,
5922360	5924480	um, the Mojo World level.
5924480	5926480	Hated it.
5926480	5929880	I'm dead.
5929880	5930880	That's fighting Mojo.
5930880	5931880	Mojo Jojo.
5931880	5932880	Just kidding.
5932880	5941080	Alright, there you go, your classic game of the week is X-Man on the Genesis.
5941080	5942080	Good times.
5942080	5945240	Thank you very much, Dark Soccer.
5945240	5949760	Good pick, even if I'm more of a fan of the arcade one, but that's okay.
5949760	5952040	Okay, Loki, why are you giggling?
5952040	5953040	Oh, nothing.
5953040	5957760	There was someone was pointing out, actually one of our listeners, they were pointing out
5957760	5962040	that, you know, have you heard that, you know, have you seen the story about Earth Defense
5962040	5965240	Force, a new Earth Defense Force game coming out next year?
5965240	5971220	And I actually clicked on the link to check it out, and then it links the Structoid article
5971220	5976920	that links also a CheapAssGamer article, where I'm the source of that news information.
5976920	5977920	Nice.
5977920	5980440	It's like, yeah, I heard about it.
5980440	5984380	Actually, I'm looking at this, this was just, what's today, the fifth?
5984380	5986320	This was like four hours ago.
5986320	5991520	Yeah, the GameStop conference, I think they had an actual logo for it, and if you go to
5991520	5998040	uh, uh, EDFIA.com, you can check out, they have the placeholder logo for it, Earth Defense
5998040	5999040	Force, Insect Armageddon.
5999040	6003760	Actually, you gotta hear this, this is pretty good, and shout out to this guy, because he
6003760	6007900	must be a listener to the show, but this is on examiner.com, I guess?
6007900	6011800	Is that the Chicago Cons, I don't know.
6011800	6015480	Orange Launch Radio podcast co-host, Loki, has recently uncovered a sequel to the B-movie
6015480	6018000	quality Earth Defense Force 2017.
6018000	6021380	If this news is correct, then all is well with the world, the game falls under the same
6021380	6023520	category as Deadly Premonition for me.
6023520	6027520	According to his information, Earth Defense Force 2017, Insect Armageddon for the Xbox
6027520	6030960	360, is being released sometime in February 2011 by D3 publisher.
6030960	6034320	Loki, who works for a game distributor and has a strong track record on things such as
6034320	6038920	unannounced games, tweeted the following, just saw this on my release list from D3,
6038920	6042640	Earth Defense Force 2017, Insect Armageddon, coming February on Xbox 360.
6042640	6045120	Dude, wasn't that like a month ago that you tweeted that?
6045120	6046120	What's a month ago?
6046120	6048440	This ran four hours ago on this website.
6048440	6051440	As someone who has invested a crazy amount of time in Earth Defense Force, I accept this
6051440	6052440	story.
6052440	6054920	That's just a repost of the Cheap Ass Gamer one, I think.
6054920	6055920	Is it?
6055920	6056920	That's Blue Swim.
6056920	6057920	Whatever.
6057920	6058920	But anyway.
6058920	6059920	That's funny to me.
6059920	6060920	It is funny.
6060920	6061920	I hope you're right.
6061920	6064520	We haven't heard anything more about it, have we?
6064520	6065520	I am right.
6065520	6066520	It's on their release list.
6066520	6072840	But I don't want anybody saying that I said that, I mean, I don't want D3 being pissed
6072840	6076720	off at me, because then that comes back to me, and then I lose my job.
6076720	6079840	That's why you gotta stop putting on Twitter, you have to do it here on the show in Secret
6079840	6081560	Club, where these people don't listen.
6081560	6083360	Well, people just need to stop realizing that.
6083360	6086160	I'm a crazy person that says these things, okay?
6086160	6095520	Yeah, it's just meant for sharing with the listeners, not to be as posted as a story.
6095520	6100720	It's so when, you know, Joystiq picks this article up, you know, say four months from
6100720	6104440	now, and they're like, hey, we just discovered that, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and then
6104440	6108840	be like, hey, I knew about that months ago, good job.
6108840	6112880	You know, it's just so you can realize that we knew it first.
6112880	6116760	But you've also, they better not be mad at you, because you know what, you've been supporting
6116760	6117760	this game from the beginning.
6117760	6118920	It is so awesome!
6118920	6119920	I am so excited!
6119920	6121840	You probably know how this will happen, honestly.
6121840	6123480	I don't know anyone who talks about this on you.
6123480	6127080	I own four copies of this game, okay?
6127080	6128540	And you know why I did that?
6128540	6131160	Just in case ever one of my discs breaks.
6131160	6134720	Which one of them has, because I played it so much.
6134720	6137880	So I had three backup copies that I bought, you know, we were clearing them out of our
6137880	6141800	warehouse for five bucks each, I'm like, I'm taking all of those!
6141800	6149000	So yeah, I love this game, and I fully support the sequel, and I hope to God it has four-player
6149000	6150000	co-op.
6150000	6151000	Can I borrow one?
6151000	6153920	I actually looked for the game, I never was able to find it.
6153920	6154920	Oh, sure.
6154920	6155920	All right.
6155920	6157240	But yeah, lesson learned here.
6157240	6159600	Stop posting low-key stuff!
6159600	6165160	No, I don't care, it doesn't, I don't, it's, I mean, they would have said something by
6165160	6166160	now.
6166160	6167160	Yeah, it's true.
6167160	6168400	It was out there a month ago.
6168400	6170560	And honestly, I mean, it's...
6170560	6171920	The official logo showed up now, right?
6171920	6175720	The official, they have the official websites up, and the GameStop conference, someone took
6175720	6178080	a picture that says, Earth Defense Force returns 2011.
6178080	6179080	So there you go.
6179080	6180080	They have a banner for it.
6180080	6181080	It's happening.
6181080	6183720	So you were, but that went to, okay, so the story that went up four hours ago then is
6183720	6187520	like behind, because this has already been confirmed, it's no longer a rumor.
6187520	6192860	Yeah, well, Destructoid, they ran their story 16 hours ago, apparently, and they just picked
6192860	6197680	up on, uh, uh, Neo Games Are Fun, I guess.
6197680	6205640	They ran their, this, uh, was posted yesterday, so, I don't know, people are just figuring
6205640	6206640	it out now.
6206640	6212120	Does, see, that's why you gotta read myself closely, because, I don't know, I like...
6212120	6217000	Well, Destructoid called D3 to get confirmation, so maybe you'll be in the office on Tuesday
6217000	6218000	and you're...
6218000	6219000	Who told you that?
6219000	6220000	Uh, uh, um...
6220000	6222480	CheapAss, well, they say, they reference CheapAssGamer.
6222480	6229080	But they also have Neo, but they also have, uh, NeoGAF, though, like, right above that
6229080	6230080	link, if you noticed.
6230080	6235120	Wait, you know what, that's kind of fucked up, though, because it really wasn't CheapAssGamer.
6235120	6241600	It's somebody on a blog on CheapAssGamer who starts off by referencing you.
6241600	6245560	You know, and that, that's, that really was not CheapAssGamer doing that at all.
6245560	6246640	It had nothing to do with that.
6246640	6248080	It was that user.
6248080	6250840	So either that user or you should have been credited.
6250840	6253120	I mean, I'm not to, I'm just saying.
6253120	6254120	A little bit, a little bit.
6254120	6258520	I don't really care that I'm not credited, and it was, it's, uh, Blue Swim, which I believe
6258520	6259520	is one of our listeners.
6259520	6260520	Yeah, I've heard that name before.
6260520	6261520	It's one of our listeners.
6261520	6262520	Uh, yeah, so...
6262520	6265840	And it's, I get it, that website does little personal blog things, and he's excited about
6265840	6266840	this game like you are.
6266840	6269640	And then, as, as he should be, it's an exciting game.
6269640	6272520	But yeah, I understand that, because they wanna run that, because, you know, they run
6272520	6273520	that kind of crap.
6273520	6276840	And now they have more proof other than me saying it, because, you know, while I have
6276840	6280960	a strong track record, I can't be trusted, because that's apparently why they didn't
6280960	6281960	run the story in the first place.
6281960	6282960	I see.
6282960	6283960	I see.
6283960	6286120	Because they need some physical proof, because I could just be spoutin' off crap.
6286120	6289560	Because, you know, that's what I do all the time.
6289560	6290560	I don't know.
6290560	6291560	It's, it's stupid.
6291560	6292560	Alright.
6292560	6293560	We're over it.
6293560	6294560	Let's get poses.
6294560	6295560	I'm over it.
6295560	6296560	Yeah, let's get poses.
6296560	6297560	Kind of, just kind of funny.
6297560	6298560	I am gonna beg them, though, for a copy of that game.
6298560	6300560	I'm like, you need to send that to me now!
6300560	6302600	Alright, we're gonna take a break.
6302600	6304400	We'll be right back with more of Orange Launch Radio.
6304400	6306080	Uh, tonight's the marathon, folks.
6306080	6310640	We're, uh, about almost two hours in already, and we've got plenty more show to come.
6310640	6312360	Uh, we still have the main show.
6312360	6316600	We are gonna do Twitter topics, rapid-fire stories, uh, some news about the iPod Touch
6316600	6321360	you're gonna get into, uh, some iPod-related news, um, Xbox Live Arcade, price drop for
6321360	6326160	the DSI, the mailbags, the FUs, all that good stuff when we come back with more of Orange
6326160	6327960	Lounge Radio.
6327960	6329640	And we are gonna be taking a music break here.
6329640	6332280	Um, I'm gonna be editing the podcast a little differently.
6332280	6335440	It's just gonna kind of jump-skip into the next segment, so I apologize for the sloppy
6335440	6337720	editing, but we can't play the copyrighted music on the podcast.
6337720	6341120	Uh, we are gonna take a quick break, though, here in studio.
6341120	6343360	Um, we'll do some music.
6343360	6348360	By the way, today's break music is, like, all music that we used to play on, uh, OLR
6348360	6353360	during, uh, when we were an actual station back in, what, like, 02, 03, so.
6353360	6355160	We're, cause we're awesome that way.
6355160	6356160	Yes.
6356160	6357840	So we'll be right back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
6357840	6358840	Don't go anywhere.
6358840	6359840	About five minutes.
6359840	6360840	Marathon continues.
6360840	6368120	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.
6368120	6372720	We are live on this Saturday, or, sorry, Sunday, September the 5th of 2010.
6372720	6373840	It's our marathon episode.
6373840	6375640	We're still in kind of the main part of the show.
6375640	6378840	Uh, there's been a lot of people asking if this marathon is gonna be podcast.
6378840	6379840	Yes.
6379840	6380840	We're gonna podcast it.
6380840	6383800	Um, it'll go up on the feed in kind of different chunks throughout the week.
6383800	6388000	Uh, but we wanna have, like, a main, you know, first off, I don't know how people are gonna
6388000	6391080	listen to, like, 12 hours of marathon throughout the week, but I suppose we have a lot of people
6391080	6395240	at work and so forth that listen to a lot of podcasts while they do, you know, whatever
6395240	6396680	desk job they might have.
6396680	6399280	Um, so, you know, we'll put it out for those guys.
6399280	6403640	But, um, for those that only want, like, the three hour OLR that they're used to, we're
6403640	6407000	kind of taping our usual show for you of all the segments we usually do, and we'll save
6407000	6409120	some of the special stuff for a little later.
6409120	6412160	So anyhow, um, let's get back into the marathon.
6412160	6413480	It's just about four o'clock.
6413480	6414480	We started at about two.
6414480	6416920	Uh, we're gonna get back into some more, um, news.
6416920	6420960	We're gonna do some rapid fire news, as we always do about this time in the show.
6420960	6423860	Twitter topics coming up, and I haven't seen a lot come through on Twitter.
6423860	6427520	Maybe I, I didn't ask earlier enough for stuff, but we'll see.
6427520	6430760	So Twitter topics, uh, if you're hearing my voice, you wanna get some Twitter topics in,
6430760	6431760	send those in.
6431760	6434320	Meanwhile, Loki, what do you got for us?
6434320	6437680	Oh, try to ref- hey, on Twitter topics, guys, try to refrain from just linking us to news
6437680	6441360	stories, because we have a lot coming up later in the marathon, too.
6441360	6445040	Um, you know, not that we don't appreciate that, but, uh, we probably are covering it
6445040	6446040	at some point.
6446040	6447040	Yeah.
6447040	6450960	But if you have good questions or, or feedback on an earlier story or something, that's definitely
6450960	6451960	what we're looking for tonight.
6451960	6454520	All right, so let's get into some rapid fire news.
6454520	6455520	Loki.
6455520	6461040	Uh, there was an Easter egg discovered from, uh, Wave Race, Blue Storm, uh, yes, that old
6461040	6462040	game.
6462040	6466040	Um, they actually just found a, uh, what was it?
6466040	6471920	It's an Easter egg that kinda changes some of the announcer audio, um, in the game.
6471920	6476360	He starts B-rating you, and then also, for some reason, when you do your boost, it goes
6476360	6482520	meow-meow, which is, I'm sure Irene would get a kick out of that.
6482520	6487600	But, uh, yeah, it's, um, it's interesting, though, and apparently it's just, uh, a key
6487600	6494000	press that you do in one of the options screens, um, but yeah, it's funny that games, even
6494000	6498200	though they're out, you know, that long, that some Easter eggs are just, you know, haven't
6498200	6499200	been discovered yet.
6499200	6503960	I remember there was one that was a couple weeks ago about, um, it was a Splinter Cell
6503960	6508680	game, and they actually had it where, uh, there was a mission, a secret mission where
6508680	6515800	you had to recover, um, or had to find all these, uh, space seals that were hidden in
6515800	6516800	the game.
6516800	6521080	It was a special, uh, save the seals mission, which is kinda weird.
6521080	6528520	Um, there is a, uh, a game from Activision called Blood Drive that's, uh, I guess the
6528520	6536080	information has been leaked out from the BBFC, um, I also saw it on their list, um, and it
6536080	6538560	is gonna be a combat racing game.
6538560	6545080	They, uh, guess, uh, the marketing shill, as they, uh, put it, is, uh, it's Shaun of
6545080	6548200	the Dead meets Mad Max in Death Race.
6548200	6551200	So basically a game that's cheesy and very gory.
6551200	6552440	That sounds like fun.
6552440	6553840	Yeah, it sounds awesome.
6553840	6560560	And, uh, it is somewhat budget priced, it's $50 retail, and, uh, it'll be coming out in
6560560	6561560	November.
6561560	6564160	So, uh, that'd be cool.
6564160	6566460	I'm, I'm down for combat racing games.
6566460	6569600	And cheesy is good, as long as it's a good game.
6569600	6573880	You know, not necessarily a terrible driving game.
6573880	6578880	I don't know what universe $50 is a budget game, but I get it, I get it's $10 cheaper,
6578880	6579880	but, yeah.
6579880	6580880	Slightly cheaper.
6580880	6581880	Hey, there you go!
6581880	6585200	It's a combat game instead of a normal 360 game, you've saved your $10 that you can spend
6585200	6586200	on live.
6586200	6589520	Uh, dance, it's your stage.
6589520	6594520	Coming out on Xbox Live Arcade September 8th, as I like to reiterate, it was a terrible
6594520	6595520	game!
6595520	6601080	But anyways, in case you're still curious about it, it is, um, a port of a German Wii
6601080	6609600	game developed by Sproing, and, uh, I guess you, uh, you'll practice 20 unique choreographies
6609600	6615120	and dance your way from the street stage all the way to the TV studio, under the watchful
6615120	6621120	eye of, uh, Detlef, Detlef D. Seust?
6621120	6622120	Some douche!
6622120	6629380	Who, who is basically, uh, some German dancer, choreographer, um...
6629380	6631280	Like I said.
6631280	6636800	Honestly, uh, like I said before, it's a terrible game.
6636800	6642480	It's just, it doesn't play very well, and, um, you know, if you look at the screenshots
6642480	6650120	that they have of it, it's got this really weird, um, not like a note highway or something,
6650120	6654420	but it's, it's sort of like DDR where they've got, you know, arrows coming down the screen,
6654420	6659480	but it's two different rows of arrows, see, as you can see right here, and, um, you have
6659480	6664360	to kind of move them in different, move your controllers in different directions to match
6664360	6670760	that, the different analog sticks, and while that might be cool and stuff to do on, like,
6670760	6675680	say, you know, a dance pad or something, it's really awkward on the controller, especially
6675680	6680960	since, you know, one side doesn't correspond to certain directions, it's just mixed all
6680960	6686880	over the place, and, uh, the music's terrible, so don't buy it.
6686880	6687880	Nice.
6687880	6688880	Instead, you need to buy some other games.
6688880	6693360	Um, I think, uh, Plants vs. Zombies might be this week, so, you know, check that out.
6693360	6700640	Uh, then of course, uh, the new iPod Touch with iOS 4, the, uh, retina display and, uh,
6700640	6706160	game center has been, uh, revealed at the new, uh, Apple event that was this week, uh,
6706160	6713440	is available in the 8 gigabyte model for $229, 32 gigs for $299, and a 64 gig model for $399.
6713440	6717480	It is coming out next week, and it basically has all the wonderful features of the new
6717480	6727160	iPhone 4, except, of course, no GPS, um, no phone, and, uh, much, much cheaper, I think,
6727160	6729720	but, um, yeah, we will be picking one of those up myself.
6729720	6733640	Also, uh, some of the other stuff that they, um, announced at the event, of course, the
6733640	6740220	new Apple TV for $99, um, which is kind of cool, I guess, if you're into that.
6740220	6744120	And then, um, something else that was kind of cool, one of the things that they're really
6744120	6749760	kind of pushing that, you know, the iPhone and iPod is like a gaming platform, Project
6749760	6755400	Sword, which is a game that's running on the Unreal 3 engine, and, um, is coming out from
6755400	6761600	Epic, and actually looks pretty good, so it is a sword fighting game that is, uh, focused
6761600	6767600	on one-on-one battles, so kind of like, uh, oh, there's a, some Wii game that came out
6767600	6771920	that's kind of similar to that, hopefully not like the Castlevania fighting game, but,
6771920	6776880	uh, looks pretty good, and it's kind of amazing to see that they ported the Unreal 3 engine
6776880	6780760	to, you know, iOS, so neat.
6780760	6781760	Neat.
6781760	6787040	Alright, um, do you, now, Alan, you were talking about something earlier that you'd seen about
6787040	6788040	this whole mess, right?
6788040	6793440	Yeah, I've been reading on Joystiq and Kotaku about a free tech demo that Epic released,
6793440	6798260	um, this week called Epic Citadel for the iPhone 4, and also for the new iPod Touches
6798260	6802640	that are coming out, and it's basically the engine that this, uh, sword game is gonna
6802640	6808280	be running on, but it's pretty much just you and the touch interface and, like, a town,
6808280	6812200	and all you can do is really just walk around and look at stuff, but the graphics, I guess,
6812200	6816580	the way they ported the Unreal engine into the phone is so good that you just can't believe
6816580	6820360	that you're getting this on an iPhone, and the videos for it, for those that want to
6820360	6825560	look it up on Google, it's called Epic Citadel, it's free on the App Store, so whoever has
6825560	6828240	a new iPhone can download it and check it out, it's supposed to be amazing.
6828240	6829240	I'm downloading it right now.
6829240	6833320	You know, it's really sad, is all they would really have to do now with the iPhone to really
6833320	6837080	kind of compete in the market, well, I mean, they already are competing in the market with,
6837080	6839640	like, the Nintendo DS and the PSP, but they're really kind of...
6839640	6843560	Well, they came out at the conference, they took a shot at Nintendo and Sony and said
6843560	6848320	that they've sold more than those two combined, although it's, it's fuzzy math, but yeah.
6848320	6849320	Yeah, yeah, yeah, I understand.
6849320	6850320	Alright, I'm downloading it.
6850320	6854800	But to basically kind of deliver that finishing blow, if you would put it, if they added,
6854800	6859160	like, some sort of actual buttons, you know, some sort of controller interface to that,
6859160	6862160	it would be, I mean, how are you going to compete with that?
6862160	6866440	I mean, now you've got, you know, a platform that's very popular, the apps are really cheap,
6866440	6870120	and the games are actually getting to be on par, if not better, than some of the stuff
6870120	6871640	that's on the PSP and on the DS.
6871640	6876120	Yeah, it really is the one thing that the iPhone, iTouch, whatever is missing is a tangible
6876120	6877120	controller.
6877120	6880800	I mean, if they could have that, it would be amazing.
6880800	6886680	When you were playing Sonic 2 on the iPhone 4 at the Apple Store, they had to bring the
6886680	6890240	screen in a little bit to, like, a little thumbnail so that it could put a little, a
6890240	6893880	digital D-pad and buttons on there, and it really affected the gameplay.
6893880	6896040	Yeah, it sure did.
6896040	6897520	So we'll see.
6897520	6902080	An alpha-kinanogram in our chatroom at chat.orangesondre.com agrees, seriously, Apple just needs to make
6902080	6903560	a controller shell for it.
6903560	6908320	Takeo Ray in our chatroom says, yes, Epic Citadel is all eye candy, and it looks sweet.
6908320	6914000	Here's something, I mean, we've kind of thrown this idea out for a while now, um, you know,
6914000	6916000	what if Apple made a gaming console?
6916000	6917920	Well, what if they did that?
6917920	6921600	I mean, the Apple TV's down to $99, who's to say they can't come up with some sort of
6921600	6924280	wireless Bluetooth controller or something that works with Apple?
6924280	6926200	All they have to do is put iOS on that box.
6926200	6928320	Yeah, iOS on the box to make it, you know, a more...
6928320	6929320	Yeah, a wireless controller.
6929320	6932520	Maybe a little bit more powerful, you know, like, kind of like an iPhone or something
6932520	6933520	like that.
6933520	6938960	And, you know, then now your games are really cheap, it's all digital, but, you know, and
6938960	6940120	make a portable system.
6940120	6941600	They're gonna...
6941600	6945160	Sony better step up, because, seriously, right now they're really slacking as far as their
6945160	6950400	system goes, and, you know, they're gonna lose it really quick.
6950400	6951400	We'll see.
6951400	6955200	All right, well, speaking of the iPhone, Mirror's Edge and Puzzle Agent also came out on the
6955200	6956200	iPhone.
6956200	6957600	Those were releases earlier this week.
6957600	6961960	Uh, Mirror's Edge, uh, was already out on the iPad, but now it's on the iPhone.
6961960	6966000	On the iPad it was ten bucks, and now it's only gonna be five bucks on the iPhone.
6966000	6970640	Uh, Telltale is, uh, trying out a game release on, uh, iPhone.
6970640	6971640	It's Puzzle Agent.
6971640	6974200	You might remember this came out on PCs a little bit ago.
6974200	6979520	Uh, that is, uh, where Telltale games are about approximately on the other iDevices.
6979520	6984360	So, um, yeah, they're on the App Store, and, uh, check those out if you, uh, are interested
6984360	6985520	in either of those series.
6985520	6989760	Uh, otherwise, going back to the more traditional consoles, on the Xbox Live Arcade, uh, King
6989760	6995520	of Fighters Sky Stage is supposed to be hitting the Japanese Xbox Live Arcade on September
6995520	6996520	15th.
6996520	6999960	Uh, it's gonna be costing, uh, ten dollars, eight, eight hundred Microsoft Points, or
6999960	7001520	whatever that converts to in Yen.
7001520	7007840	Uh, and that is the one, by the way, where, like, Terry Bogard and Mai are, like, shooters.
7007840	7011120	This is that one that's the whole, like, King of Fighters are in a shooting game.
7011120	7012120	Remember that?
7012120	7013120	Yeah.
7013120	7014120	That's this game.
7014120	7017720	So, a lot of the, uh, horizontal screen real estate is just taken up with pretty pictures
7017720	7019880	of, of Terry and Mai there.
7019880	7025200	And lastly, for my little bit here, Tron Evolution has a release date, and there's also a sweet
7025200	7026840	collector's edition to go with it.
7026840	7028760	The release date is December 7th.
7028760	7030800	I think that's a couple weeks before the movie.
7030800	7034920	Uh, Tron, it, it's kind of interesting that Disney's doing this twice, because Epic Mickey
7034920	7036760	has a collector's edition, too.
7036760	7041680	But, uh, with Tron Evolution, for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, there will be the, um, collector's
7041680	7042680	edition.
7042680	7048520	It comes with a toy model light cycle from Schlight, from Sideshow Collectibles, a display
7048520	7051860	case for it with a drawer to keep the game in.
7051860	7056520	It's $130, which, you know, so you're paying an extra, what, $70 for this figurine, but
7056520	7059960	I gotta say, that's a sweet-looking figurine.
7059960	7062200	That's, it's like a little light bike from the new movie.
7062200	7067400	That is, I don't know if I, if it actually lit up, I might have to do it, but, uh, no
7067400	7068400	word on that yet.
7068400	7071200	I would just wait and see, because they're gonna have collectible toys and stuff, I'm
7071200	7072840	sure, when the Tron stuff comes out.
7072840	7073840	Very true.
7073840	7077320	You could probably buy one standalone that would be a lot cooler than that.
7077320	7082640	Um, it just, those collector's editions, man, sometimes it's a real waste of money.
7082640	7085680	However, though, you know, the Black Ops one that they have coming out now with that
7085680	7088840	little car that has, like, a camera on it and stuff?
7088840	7094160	Those things are actually out now as some other device, um, but, I mean, they're really
7094160	7099440	popular in, like, the hacking community, because they're so easy to modify to do a bunch of
7099440	7102960	different things, like installing Linux and crap on it and stuff, so it might be a good
7102960	7107440	buy to actually get that, or if, you know, you're smart, you'll just go buy the actual
7107440	7112120	toy that's out now instead of spending, you know, the extra money.
7112120	7116600	Tron is awesome, but any game that's a movie tie-in, eh, not sure of what.
7116600	7117920	I don't know, this game looks pretty awesome.
7117920	7121680	I gotta say, I played it at E3, and it was kinda cool, because it was like Prince of
7121680	7126200	Persia, but with Tron graphics, and, like, apparently it's heavily influenced with Capoeira,
7126200	7128120	like all the fighting is based on Capoeira.
7128120	7132520	I gotta say, it was kinda rad, but Shane was watching me play it, and, you know, Shane
7132520	7135720	didn't really see Tron as a kid, because I think he was, like, born the year it came
7135720	7142480	out or something, um, so, like, I know, right, so I think, like, he was looking at it going,
7142480	7146600	there's not a lot of graphics in this game, what is, and I'm like, that's, it looks like
7146600	7151200	Tron, Tron looked like that, you don't understand, it's okay, it's stylistic, so he wasn't as
7151200	7154240	into it as I was, though, but I was playing the demo, and I was like, this is cool.
7154240	7159720	Yeah, they have a little cinematic teaser or something, or maybe an intro, or one of
7159720	7164120	the cutscenes in the game, but they have it where, you know, the main guy, cause it kinda
7164120	7168640	reminds me a lot of, like, the forts unleashed, almost, you know, he's chasing after these
7168640	7175240	guys on light cycles and stuff, and one of the recognizers, and, you know, he's chasing
7175240	7178800	after them, and all of a sudden, you know, he kills one of them with the disc on the
7178800	7185480	actual light cycle, and then they start shooting at him, he jumps up, like runs along the wall,
7185480	7189980	and then transforms back into the light cycle again, it's just fucking sweet.
7189980	7193300	I gotta admit, every time, like, I've been to the movies a couple times lately, and that
7193300	7197040	trailer usually plays, and every time they show the trailer for the new Tron movie, I
7197040	7200400	get a little stiffy, it looks awesome.
7200400	7207120	We need to see that in 3D, IMAX, in with those D-Box motion seats, just do the full shebang.
7207120	7212280	As soon as those tickets go on sale, like, I'm almost wanting to go to L.A. just to see
7212280	7217200	it at the official Disney theater, cause I'm that crazy.
7217200	7218200	I'd go with you.
7218200	7219200	I know you would.
7219200	7221200	If you paid for gas.
7221200	7222200	Maybe.
7222200	7223200	We'll see.
7223200	7224200	Really?
7224200	7225200	We'll see.
7225200	7227200	You gotta pay your own way into Disneyland if we go by there, but, we'll figure that
7227200	7228200	out.
7228200	7229200	We may not have two.
7229200	7230200	We'll see, we'll see.
7230200	7234440	Alright, speaking of Disneyland, now here, now Dark Sakura, as if that wasn't enough,
7234440	7235440	wait for this.
7235440	7238000	It's a Tron world, after all.
7238000	7241200	Yeah, they are actually putting Tron in Disneyland.
7241200	7243480	No people movers not coming back, sadly.
7243480	7247960	Get this, Electronica launches in October.
7247960	7249920	It's the digital dance party.
7249920	7254760	It's going in Disney California Adventure, and they're gonna turn the Hollywood section
7254760	7261000	of California Adventure into this whole, like, Tron section, it's like a big dance party.
7261000	7264120	They're gonna do a recreation of Flynn Arcade.
7264120	7268840	It'll be at Electronica, and, uh, yeah, it's gonna be this huge event that starts October
7268840	7269840	8th.
7269840	7270840	I better have all the games in there.
7270840	7271840	And this is what pisses me off.
7271840	7274920	That's a week after I'm gonna be there anyway for gay days.
7274920	7275920	So mad.
7275920	7276920	Bitches.
7276920	7278720	But, that means I have to go back.
7278720	7282960	So it's October 8th until, I think, we need to go.
7282960	7284440	Like, are we that crazy?
7284440	7285440	Yes.
7285440	7286440	Yes.
7286440	7287440	We're going.
7287440	7288800	So there'll be no show the week the Tron movie comes out because Dark Sakura and I
7288800	7294480	are gonna go see, uh, see it at the official 3D Disney theater in Anaheim.
7294480	7295480	Yes.
7295480	7296480	Yes, we are.
7296480	7297480	Wow.
7297480	7302040	We're gonna travel across country to see a movie in a theater.
7302040	7303040	Yes.
7303040	7305160	We're worse than the Twilight fans in some regards.
7305160	7311840	If only we could do that here and see a movie in a theater.
7311840	7316360	But you don't understand because then when it's over, we can go to the Electronica party,
7316360	7319540	and then we can ride Space Mountain a million times.
7319540	7322760	They should actually redo Space Mountain as Tron Mountain for the movie.
7322760	7327060	Well there's a rumor that if the Tron thing is really successful and the movie does really
7327060	7330920	well that the Tomorrowland arcade is going to permanently be Flynn's arcade.
7330920	7334280	That will make me completely giddy.
7334280	7335280	Yeah.
7335280	7336280	I think that's the way it should be too.
7336280	7337280	So everybody is.
7337280	7340880	I hope that the reproduction Flynn's that they do is gonna have all the old games and
7340880	7341880	everything too.
7341880	7342880	I don't care.
7342880	7347520	It apparently is the same as our game that's been at like Comic Con and some of that stuff
7347520	7348880	has been traveling around a little bit.
7348880	7352020	But I don't care if this new Tron movie is terrible.
7352020	7356720	You all need to satisfy like what I've built it up in my mind of seeing this as a child
7356720	7359440	and you all need to go see this movie opening day so it does well.
7359440	7360760	And dude, it's twice.
7360760	7362320	It's Flynn's the bad guy.
7362320	7364280	At least I think he is.
7364280	7365280	Or is he?
7365280	7367560	It might be a clone.
7367560	7369200	It's Clues the bad guy.
7369200	7370200	All right.
7370200	7371200	Anyway.
7371200	7372200	Yeah.
7372200	7373200	I'm so excited.
7373200	7376600	Takeo Ray is in our chat room saying, oh, the marathon's affecting Sky already.
7376600	7378800	Stiffy's crazy trips to Disneyland.
7378800	7379800	It's over.
7379800	7380800	Uh, chat.orangeontrader.com.
7380800	7382440	Uh, let's see.
7382440	7383440	Break Man.
7383440	7385660	Disney's gonna make a live nerd dance party.
7385660	7386920	Yes they are.
7386920	7387920	Nerd dance party.
7387920	7391080	And you know if Dark Soccer and I are gonna be there, it's an extra nerd dance party.
7391080	7393920	We need to figure out what day that is and like announce our arrival well in advance.
7393920	7395480	We need sparkly silver clothes.
7395480	7397580	Cause we need to get some of our LA peeps to gum.
7397580	7398580	We need Marissa.
7398580	7399580	We need Marissa.
7399580	7401620	Uh, to, to shake her boobies at this.
7401620	7406200	We need DJ Tyrant to show up and, and write a story for the website once every six months
7406200	7407200	or so.
7407200	7408200	Disneyland friends.
7408200	7409200	People who work there.
7409200	7410200	Yes.
7410200	7411200	We love you.
7411200	7412200	Yeah.
7412200	7413960	We need, we need our cast member friends that work there to show up.
7413960	7416840	We need a, I know we have other LA listeners, so we're going to figure out what day this
7416840	7418960	is and the minute tickets go on sales.
7418960	7419960	We got to get them.
7419960	7420960	Okay.
7420960	7421960	You're doing this.
7421960	7422960	Oh my God.
7422960	7423960	I'm so excited.
7423960	7424960	Maybe Scott can come with you.
7424960	7425960	Scott's in LA.
7425960	7426960	Yeah.
7426960	7427960	There we go.
7427960	7428960	I don't know.
7428960	7430440	I don't know if this, of course I'm making all these plans while Dan's in the other room
7430440	7438840	going, probably going the fuck she is, Dan, we're going to go see Tron at Disneyland.
7438840	7439840	Okay.
7439840	7442080	He said, Oh, we have it on the air.
7442080	7443480	Dan, I'll take it.
7443480	7444480	Put Dan in the car.
7444480	7446480	Dan's coming with us.
7446480	7447480	I don't care.
7447480	7448480	We ain't working.
7448480	7449480	All right.
7449480	7450480	Anyhow.
7450480	7454520	Spazinator in chat says Sky will try to get Loki to build him a real light cycle.
7454520	7455520	I just might.
7455520	7456520	All right.
7456520	7457520	I don't know how to build motorcycles.
7457520	7459520	Well, you better learn real quick.
7459520	7460520	Okay.
7460520	7463520	Let's move on with some other quick stories that was supposed to be a quick story ended
7463520	7464520	up taking like 15 minutes.
7464520	7465520	Dark Sakura.
7465520	7471880	Namco is remaking arcade classics actually, um, coming out for we is going to be Namco
7471880	7479600	museum mega mix, which has, um, different remixed games, um, like the Gallagher remix,
7479600	7482120	um, the Pac-Man rail shooter thing.
7482120	7488200	Um, there's also going to be though, um, an old school game called Grobda remix, which
7488200	7490160	is a shimupi game.
7490160	7491160	So yay.
7491160	7495560	Also of course, Pac-Man, Mappy, Rally X, Galaga, wah wah.
7495560	7501200	And then, um, for Sims 3 fans like myself, Barnacle Bay, they're getting on the big pirate
7501200	7502360	bandwagon.
7502360	7506160	And you know what my theory about this is, is that, okay, they're putting out downloadable
7506160	7513040	content so that you can have a, you know, like a, it's a whole town of piratey goodness,
7513040	7516560	but I think they're really getting the inspiration from all these players that have made their
7516560	7519360	own pirate stuff.
7519360	7522340	So there's like, oh, we'll do it too.
7522340	7524960	So anyway, it's going to be, uh, coming out.
7524960	7526720	Can you make Johnny Depp walk the plank?
7526720	7527720	I wish.
7527720	7533320	Um, and then, um, for, uh, people who may be a little bit pissed off with Xbox in September,
7533320	7535040	there's Halo freebies.
7535040	7536480	Yay.
7536480	7542320	So with the launch of Halo Reach, um, it's going to be, uh, uh, the 14th through 20th
7542320	7549640	will be invasion week and, um, you get new gear, exciting content, help Microsoft, spectacular
7549640	7552560	prizes, and a chance to play with creators of the game.
7552560	7554200	And that was a quote.
7554200	7561520	Um, also Xbox live gold, um, uh, features to silver members on September 17th, 2017
7561520	7563280	through 20th.
7563280	7566880	And anyone who gets online can download the invasion theme.
7566880	7572960	Um, I just see master chiefs running around in party hats.
7572960	7578880	Also as well, um, resident evil five avatar outfits and game add ons will be discounted.
7578880	7585640	September 13th puzzle games, um, uh, we'll be getting the, uh, DOTW deal best to move
7585640	7592200	live puzzle Chronicles tower blocks, deluxe or knock down, um, to 400 Microsoft points,
7592200	7600680	five bucks and gerrymancers going from a 1200 to 800 and then a rock band three avatar stuff.
7600680	7608000	And, uh, I also on the marketplaces bully scholarship edition and cabellas African safari,
7608000	7610040	which isn't Africa.
7610040	7613720	Speaking of all this, are we allowed to talk about what I'm dance playing in the front
7613720	7614720	room right now?
7614720	7616360	Or is that like a no, no topic?
7616360	7617360	No, no.
7617360	7618360	Okay.
7618360	7619360	No, no.
7619360	7620360	Nevermind.
7620360	7621360	This completely unrelated to what we were just talking about.
7621360	7626120	I mean, we can talk about it, but I don't know where he got it.
7626120	7627120	Me neither.
7627120	7628120	Oh, sweet.
7628120	7633360	Oh, we're getting more people committing to coming to all this could be awesome.
7633360	7634360	All right.
7634360	7635360	Anyhow.
7635360	7637360	Um, let's move on.
7637360	7639840	Uh, did you have a story you want to do?
7639840	7640840	Loki?
7640840	7641840	Yeah, sure.
7641840	7642840	Oh wait, I got to do Twitter topics.
7642840	7643840	Oh my gosh.
7643840	7644840	I don't want to forget the tweets.
7644840	7645840	Let's do Twitter topics.
7645840	7646840	Okay.
7646840	7647840	That'll give you a little more time to think about that story.
7647840	7655320	Twitter.com slash O L R. If you want to send us a tweet, we only have a few tonight probably
7655320	7656640	because I said, don't send us links.
7656640	7657640	Also.
7657640	7661080	I don't think I could, I'd be, I don't think tiger claws and chat tonight, like, is he
7661080	7662080	okay?
7662080	7665440	He might've, he probably went on vacation for labor day.
7665440	7666440	Like most people do.
7666440	7669000	So I'm just, I, every night I expect to see links from tiger claw.
7669000	7670000	They're not there tonight.
7670000	7673280	So I was, I just, what do we need to send a search party to his home?
7673280	7677760	Cause this is not typical, but I think he's, I think he's probably on a trip.
7677760	7682440	All right, let's move on.
7682440	7688200	Uh, our, our good buddy, uh, Jay Jugo and uh, on Twitter is saying breakdown for the
7688200	7692680	wind by OLR because they're playing the old school, uh, music tonight from our old rotation,
7692680	7696760	which is all the old, uh, all the old Bahmani music and so forth.
7696760	7702360	Uh, Marin Marvel speaking of people we may or may not see at the Tron thing is OLR marathon
7702360	7705120	night, a horrible night to have a curse.
7705120	7706120	Yes.
7706120	7709560	Um, what curse, what would be a bad curse to have during the, what would be a bad curse
7709560	7711600	to have during the OLR marathon?
7711600	7712600	Literary vampires.
7712600	7715240	Probably diarrhea would be a bad curse to have actually during this night.
7715240	7718240	So we better not get pizza.
7718240	7720240	All right.
7720240	7724160	Um, let's see more, uh, tweets here.
7724160	7729400	Leo Shen sends us a tweet, blaze blue continuum shift two announced for arcades and three
7729400	7731120	new characters are on the way.
7731120	7734400	He does link us to the official website and I don't think this is a story that even comes
7734400	7735400	up later.
7735400	7739160	The, now the official website is all in Japanese, so I can't say a whole lot else with this,
7739160	7744000	but, uh, for those of you guys that are fans of this series, you played this game, right?
7744000	7747120	Uh, Alan, I think Loki, you might have a little bit too.
7747120	7752320	I have, yeah, I have the, um, the arcade version on my cabinet.
7752320	7753880	Did you have this one game fly one week?
7753880	7757800	It was the very first game I got with game fly and I brought it over to your house.
7757800	7759760	So I guess that weekend a new one coming out.
7759760	7760760	So that's pretty cool.
7760760	7761760	All right.
7761760	7767800	Uh, tail Ray sends us a tweet, would y'all be interested in doing the extra life marathon
7767800	7768800	this year?
7768800	7773760	Donations go to your local CMN hospital, which if I'm not mistaken is children's miracle
7773760	7774760	network.
7774760	7775760	I think.
7775760	7778240	Uh, I do remember these tweets from last year.
7778240	7779560	God, has it been a year already?
7779560	7780560	I guess so.
7780560	7782720	Uh, October 16th.
7782720	7783720	Whew.
7783720	7786600	Um, it depends.
7786600	7787600	We do.
7787600	7789680	We try to do this last year and something happened.
7789680	7793000	Uh, yeah, it just didn't work out.
7793000	7794000	Something happened.
7794000	7795000	It didn't work out.
7795000	7800480	Um, uh, if we can't participate directly, we'll definitely donate at least.
7800480	7804320	Uh, but we'll see, I don't want to commit just yet, especially after doing a marathon
7804320	7805320	tonight.
7805320	7809400	Um, I don't know if we could do like a full, full, full marathon, especially ever having
7809400	7810400	just done one tonight.
7810400	7811400	We should have waited, huh?
7811400	7814120	Uh, but we'll see.
7814120	7817200	I just don't want to promise and not have it happen cause that's happened before and
7817200	7819960	it felt like we felt really poopy doing that.
7819960	7821760	So, but we'll see.
7821760	7825000	If nothing else, we will mention it lots on the show and help donate.
7825000	7828160	Uh, Spazinator PSN sends us some tweets.
7828160	7833200	For those that have a PS3 and care, there's an episode of Campus PD on the PSN store that's
7833200	7834920	temporarily free.
7834920	7836920	It's under TV shows and free.
7836920	7839180	Hey, I like free things.
7839180	7840180	That's good.
7840180	7841840	Campus PD is like cops, but with more boobs.
7841840	7843320	Is there, is that what it really is?
7843320	7845020	Yeah, that's what Campus PD is.
7845020	7846020	It's wow.
7846020	7847880	And interestingly enough, it's on G4.
7847880	7849800	Oh, wow.
7849800	7851640	This is what I watched early in the morning.
7851640	7853280	Drunken sorority chicks?
7853280	7858080	It's it's basically just cops on, like there was an episode of that I watched that they
7858080	7864200	were busting some guys for having, you know, pot in a frat house or something like that
7864200	7865960	because they saw it through a window.
7865960	7871760	And so they came in and it was just a bunch of hippie college kids complaining that you
7871760	7874840	don't have the right to enter my premises, blah, blah, blah, blah.
7874840	7875840	It's in plain sight.
7875840	7876840	I see it right here.
7876840	7879920	Therefore, it gives us, you know, probable cause to enter your residence.
7879920	7884000	So shut the fuck up, Mr. Law Major.
7884000	7885260	Pot in a frat house?
7885260	7886260	You don't say.
7886260	7887260	I know.
7887260	7888260	Get out.
7888260	7889260	Get right out of town.
7889260	7890260	It was.
7890260	7891260	No.
7891260	7892260	Oh, my gosh.
7892260	7896280	I just used to call stuff like that VCRs.
7896280	7899320	We called my friends rats VCRs.
7899320	7902280	Next thing you tell me, there's going to be underage drinking in the dormitories.
7902280	7903280	Don't.
7903280	7906400	And then they have the new season that has, they have the spring break season that's coming
7906400	7907400	out this fall.
7907400	7913840	That's basically just more chicks and if you've watched Cops in like Mardi Gras or whatever,
7913840	7919000	they have that episode or whatever, Ho Ho Ho, their special, like, you know, episodes
7919000	7923120	with all the prostitutes that they're picking up and stuff.
7923120	7925080	Put your top back on, ma'am.
7925080	7926080	Ma'am.
7926080	7928120	Put your shirt back on, ma'am.
7928120	7929120	Come with me, ma'am.
7929120	7931880	We had anything to drink tonight, ma'am.
7931880	7932880	Yeah.
7932880	7936240	I mean, it's, yeah.
7936240	7937240	Wonderful programming.
7937240	7938240	This is what they put.
7938240	7940320	Can you believe Cops is still on?
7940320	7945640	Like Cops started like when Fox Network started in like 87 and it is still on.
7945640	7947760	Well, that America's most wanted.
7947760	7948760	Still going.
7948760	7949760	That's true.
7949760	7952200	John Walsh, John Walsh still hosted after all these years?
7952200	7953200	Probably.
7953200	7956560	Didn't they finally find who killed his son like just not that long ago and it turned
7956560	7957560	out the guy died?
7957560	7962920	Well, the guy that was already in prison, I think, kept confessing and then recanting
7962920	7966600	it like four times so they couldn't, but yeah, it's probably on his Wikipedia.
7966600	7967600	Oh, probably.
7967600	7969680	That was a horrible story, though, what happened?
7969680	7970680	Yeah.
7970680	7971680	Because he was, it actually involves video games.
7971680	7973680	He was playing like an Atari 2600 when he got kidnapped, right?
7973680	7975680	Or something like that, at a Sears or something?
7975680	7976680	I think so.
7976680	7977680	Or watching other kids play it, I think?
7977680	7978680	I don't know.
7978680	7979680	Anyway.
7979680	7980680	Sorry.
7980680	7981680	Don't mean to be a downer on the show.
7981680	7982680	Wah wah.
7982680	7983680	Wah wah.
7983680	7984680	Wah wah.
7984680	7985680	That was it for the Twitter topics.
7985680	7989320	We'll have more tweets later on in the evening at Twitter.com slash O-L-R.
7989320	7991960	I'll be tweeting random stuff and Klingon, by the way.
7991960	7992960	Thank you.
7992960	7993960	From mine.
7993960	7996600	Dark Tetsuya says that Salacious Pop does a great state trooper.
7996600	7998560	There you go.
7998560	7999560	Ma'am, please.
7999560	8003200	Ma'am, don't walk, don't run out into the street, ma'am.
8003200	8004200	Put your shirt on.
8004200	8005880	Into the car, ma'am.
8005880	8008600	Brakeman in the chat says, ma'am, please put your shirt back on.
8008600	8012800	Oh, sorry, I meant sir.
8012800	8014600	Clearly that individual had moobs.
8014600	8015600	Alright.
8015600	8019400	Loki, do you have some more news for us?
8019400	8020400	Yes.
8020400	8024600	Music Unlimited is a service that's rumored, well, was rumored to be coming to the Sony
8024600	8025600	platforms.
8025600	8028880	It is now confirmed to be coming to the Sony platforms, as opposed to PlayStation 3 and
8028880	8030480	PSP.
8030480	8039360	It is, I guess, powered by curiosity, which is not a word, but according to Sony it is.
8039360	8045480	It is apparently going to be a music service that's cloud based that'll, at least it'll
8045480	8051640	be coming out in Europe, and subscribers will have access to millions of songs, and then
8051640	8056240	of course it's going to be very similar to kind of the Zoom pass that's on, you know,
8056240	8057920	Microsoft service.
8057920	8063160	And so in addition, the service will be compatible with Bravia TVs, Blu-ray disc players, home
8063160	8069280	theater systems, and Vio computers, with one single account without a need to manage digital
8069280	8071740	files so you can listen to a bunch of stuff.
8071740	8076160	So am I correct in assuming this is just more of that corporate synergy with Sony music?
8076160	8077160	I think so, yeah.
8077160	8081600	And so probably a movie thing is, well I guess they already have movies on Sony Marketplace,
8081600	8085000	so I guess, never mind, but maybe more TV.
8085000	8087000	Just want a piece of the apple pie.
8087000	8088960	Piece of the apple pie.
8088960	8091200	All coming together.
8091200	8097040	I mean, I guess if they've had movies and TV all this time, I mean, where the hell's
8097040	8098040	the music been?
8098040	8102200	Once in a while they'll have like a game soundtrack or something, but you know, they haven't done
8102200	8104600	a major music store at all, that's for sure.
8104600	8109880	They haven't done anything major on their services.
8109880	8112400	So yeah, I don't know.
8112400	8113400	Alright.
8113400	8118800	Well, let's move on and talk about, going back to the iPhone stuff a little bit, I actually
8118800	8123080	have, I used to play this game a lot, it was Aurora Faint, it was kind of a Bejeweledy
8123080	8124840	type game that they have on the iPhone.
8124840	8127320	Well these guys are really taking these to the next level.
8127320	8133000	They've written their own platform called Open Faint, which is sort of what you could
8133000	8138120	say inspired the whole Game Center thing that Apple is set to launch, I believe next week,
8138120	8141800	which in turn is sort of their version of Xbox Live.
8141800	8144920	Open Faint, of course, trying to be competitive with the press conference and some of the
8144920	8149760	news about Game Center that came out, has announced their own deal here.
8149760	8154200	Aurora Faint is making Open Faint and it's called Playtime is this new thing.
8154200	8162600	It's going to be a real-time multiplayer gameplay, get this, between iOS and Android devices.
8162600	8167640	It's bridging the gap and that's something Game Center, you know, is never going to do.
8167640	8169360	So Playtime is actually going to bridge that gap.
8169360	8174960	It will allow real-time voice chat during the gameplay across these platforms.
8174960	8179940	CEO Jason Citrone of Aurora Faint said, quote, traditionally, multiplayer technology has
8179940	8182560	been accessible only to top-tier developers.
8182560	8185040	It's just too complicated and time-consuming.
8185040	8191720	So he invented Playtime, which literally takes one day to integrate into a casual game.
8191720	8196320	More information about this, VoIP lobbies and matchmaking for casual games, expanding
8196320	8201920	to incorporate team-based voice chat, 16-player game servers for the core titles.
8201920	8203600	So it definitely sounds like they're trying to build this thing up.
8203600	8205400	And as far as I know, it doesn't cost money.
8205400	8206400	Here's the thing, though.
8206400	8211300	The games I've noticed on my phone that do support this, it kind of gets in the way.
8211300	8216400	You only have so much real estate on the iPhone screen and I sort of get annoyed when I try
8216400	8221280	to launch a game and I get this whole, register now for Open Faint, you do do.
8221280	8225200	And I'm just like, fuck off, I want to play my Commodore 64 emulator.
8225200	8232040	You know, I don't need VoIP to play The Last Ninja on the Commodore 64, get out.
8232040	8236560	So some of it is kind of annoying, like they need to tone it down a little bit.
8236560	8238240	You know, it's nice that it's there.
8238240	8239560	This technology is cool.
8239560	8243480	I think it's great that they're bridging the gap, but don't throw it in my face.
8243480	8248800	Like stop, have it a little button in the corner that I can use.
8248800	8252840	I guess it hides once you do kind of sign in, it's just annoying.
8252840	8257920	I don't like trying to go into a game for the first time and it's like, sign up!
8257920	8262560	Like Tap Tap Revenge 3 I tried playing for the first time and it's like, sign up for
8262560	8267520	Tapulous and connect to your Facebook and like, fuck off!
8267520	8271040	I just want to tap my screen in time to stuff.
8271040	8272040	What are you looking at over there, DarkStalker?
8272040	8273040	Is that that...
8273040	8274040	Epic Citadel.
8274040	8276000	Oh, the Epic Citadel thing we were just talking about earlier?
8276000	8277000	That's pretty damn nice.
8277000	8278000	Nice.
8278000	8281000	Maybe I'll take some screen captures.
8281000	8283360	We'll see.
8283360	8284360	Let's see.
8284360	8290660	I have no idea how to pronounce this, Beta CNCRA, it says, I don't care about ads, they
8290660	8291880	should go die.
8291880	8292880	Go away ads.
8292880	8297140	Well, I understand that ads are what it takes to support some free things, but some of these
8297140	8299760	like open, faint games are things I pay for.
8299760	8301520	And that's where things get really annoying.
8301520	8303520	So I'm just saying.
8303520	8304520	Anyhow.
8304520	8307920	Chat.OrangeLawnsRadio.com if you want to chat with us live here at Orange Lawns Radio as
8307920	8312340	we tape our super long episode today, Labor Day Weekend.
8312340	8315400	Dark Soccer, are you going to have to put that down and talk about what you've got in
8315400	8316400	gaming news?
8316400	8317400	Stuff.
8317400	8318400	Like?
8318400	8322680	Hey, can you give me a chance to finish?
8322680	8330920	Well, you know, American McGee is doing another Alice game, Alice Madness Returns.
8330920	8336400	But it's going to be not over the top, so they're saying.
8336400	8340760	It's going to be adult and mature.
8340760	8346280	But it's definitely going to be an M-rated title, but it's not like they're doing it
8346280	8348220	just to make it an M-rated title.
8348220	8356560	They want it to be, you know, with the established universe, but have it be something more for
8356560	8358120	an adult to grasp.
8358120	8359120	Not for kids.
8359120	8361380	It's not Disney.
8361380	8368220	And they don't want to make it extra violent, extra gory, extra bloody.
8368220	8375080	They want the content itself, the subject matter, to be where it gets the M-rating.
8375080	8378200	If that makes sense.
8378200	8379680	I think it's going to be fun.
8379680	8384320	I mean, it's not going to be like over the top Mortal Kombat style blood, but they still,
8384320	8386000	you know, Alice is still going to cut things, right?
8386000	8388640	I'm sure if she stabs something, it'll bleed.
8388640	8391080	Just won't, you know, gush a geyser of blood.
8391080	8393360	I'm really not sure how to take a news story like that.
8393360	8397760	It's like they're saying like, well, we're not trying to go for a mature rating, but
8397760	8401960	our game will have mature content, but it's necessary to the plot.
8401960	8406000	That's like telling an actress, like, your topless scene is integral to the plot.
8406000	8407000	Like it's.
8407000	8408000	It always is.
8408000	8412480	It's statistically important to the story that you're naked in this scene.
8412480	8418040	Highbrow going for exactly like, you know, when the killer gets you in the shower, you
8418040	8421680	see, you need to be topless because you're in the shower.
8421680	8430400	Like I'm talking about like dealing with like mental illness or an abusive childhood topless
8430400	8436940	scenes or I agree the type of the type of topic though considered mature and adult would
8436940	8442000	be something like the character itself is supposed to be kind of nuts and living a very
8442000	8443560	unhappy life.
8443560	8445840	And a brothel full of topless women.
8445840	8451400	Well, usually the the protagonists in Silent Hill games, once you finally find out what
8451400	8454880	their origin is, it's like, whoa, that's really messed up.
8454880	8463120	He did what to his wife or like the little girl who her special bad guy was the the daddy
8463120	8466880	chained to the door with the knife trying to do dirty things.
8466880	8472560	Takeo Ray in our chat room says the 3D boobs in Piranha 3D were very important to its plot.
8472560	8476960	That's a movie I haven't seen yet, but I think I need to, even though I think that a lot
8476960	8482440	of those gore movies are kind of stupid, like it's like when it knows it's over the top.
8482440	8486160	Sometimes they're really funny, but sometimes you got to have boobs in there just to show
8486160	8487160	your cheese.
8487160	8491540	But what I don't understand is that they're like, there's actually a version.
8491540	8492540	This was great.
8492540	8493540	It was in the local paper.
8493540	8496120	They were talking about the local drive ins and how they're still going.
8496120	8500040	And they were showing Piranha at the drive in, but it's not 3D because you can't do 3D
8500040	8501040	on a drive in screen.
8501040	8505540	And they were interviewing this lady who took her, it had nothing to do with this fact,
8505540	8506540	but it should have.
8506540	8510800	She took her six and eight year old to go see Piranha.
8510800	8513720	And I'm not one to tell you what to do with your kids, but at the same time, I couldn't
8513720	8517640	help and look at that, but go really, really bad parenting.
8517640	8523040	You're going to take your six year old to go see Piranha and it's not even in 3D.
8523040	8524040	Does that make it better?
8524040	8525140	I don't know.
8525140	8530000	And then you take them to the lake the next day and then they don't want to go to the
8530000	8531000	lake anymore.
8531000	8535240	Dartetsuya says, oh, speaking of gore movies, apparently Saw is getting a 3D version.
8535240	8536240	Do not want.
8536240	8537240	I heard that.
8537240	8538240	Do not want.
8538240	8539240	See, there's one.
8539240	8542440	See, I like it when it's over the top, but I don't like it when it tries to be real like
8542440	8543440	Saw does.
8543440	8544440	Do you want to see Machete?
8544440	8545440	I want to see Machete.
8545440	8550160	Derek H in chat says Machete has fake Lindsay Lohan boobs.
8550160	8553880	I heard there was nudity from La Lohan in that.
8553880	8559240	As I described, as I described Machete this morning, it's a movie based off a trailer
8559240	8562440	based off a fake movie.
8562440	8563440	Definitely want to see it.
8563440	8564440	You know what else is cool?
8564440	8567520	They saw a new trailer for Hobo with a Shotgun.
8567520	8568520	What?
8568520	8569520	Yeah.
8569520	8571440	Hobo with a Shotgun is also from Grindhouse.
8571440	8576060	It was actually, they had a contest to have people create a fan trailer and that was the
8576060	8579640	one that won and now it's actually going to become a real movie.
8579640	8580640	Hobo with a Shotgun.
8580640	8581640	Wow.
8581640	8582880	Can I, can I share some news real quick?
8582880	8584240	I guess.
8584240	8589000	For players who play Star Trek Online, the C store is having a Labor Day sale, so I just
8589000	8590640	thought I'd share.
8590640	8593240	For all two of you that are playing Star Trek Online.
8593240	8594240	Hey!
8594240	8601400	Alright, moving on, Loki and me and then the mailbag at mailbagatorangeontradio.com.
8601400	8604080	Oh yes.
8604080	8611520	So you know, of course the Microsoft, you know, summer gaming thing worked out really
8611520	8617920	well for them, so they're going to do it again, but this time in the fall.
8617920	8622960	And they're going to call it the Microsoft Xbox Live Arcade Game Feast Promotion.
8622960	8625040	And there will be of course a bunch of games coming out.
8625040	8632800	It's I guess starting September 29th with Hydrophobia for 1200 Microsoft points, followed
8632800	8638160	by Comic Jumper on October 6th, also for 1200 Microsoft points.
8638160	8642400	Pinball FX 2 will be available October 13th, and guess what?
8642400	8644200	It's free!
8644200	8648520	And you can import your tables from the first Pinball FX game with each additional table
8648520	8649720	being purchased individually.
8649720	8651400	Well I like free!
8651400	8652880	Free is good!
8652880	8660600	Finally, also Super Meat Boy will be coming out October 20th to wrap the whole thing up.
8660600	8664840	So that'll also be 1200 Microsoft points.
8664840	8669120	Hopefully we'll be able to give you guys previews on each of these games soon because I've played
8669120	8675480	most of them already, so we will talk about them in coming weeks.
8675480	8676480	Alrighty.
8676480	8681760	Any of those games you think are worth buying based off of what you've played so far?
8681760	8682880	Comic Jumper was kind of fun.
8682880	8689240	It was a beat-em-up game, it has a really neat looking, it's kind of like a, oh, Comic
8689240	8692920	Zone but HD-ish.
8692920	8695800	The main character is kind of weird looking though.
8695800	8698400	He looks like a Ninja Turtle almost.
8698400	8707400	Ninja Turtle crossed with like, I don't know, some sort of Flash Gordon and Deadpool.
8707400	8708760	And then Super Meat Boy is supposed to be really good.
8708760	8712000	I was just disappointed that it was broken on a, you know.
8712000	8714120	Well it won't stay broken forever.
8714120	8716560	Yeah, it'll fix it eventually.
8716560	8719200	And Hydrophobia, I don't know about Hydrophobia.
8719200	8725760	Hey, price drop, the DSI and the DSI extra-large are going to be getting a, excuse me, hiccup
8725760	8726760	at a bad time.
8726760	8727760	Whoops.
8727760	8731040	In North America, the DSI and DSI extra-large are getting a price drop.
8731040	8735280	It's effective September 12th, so not just yet but real soon.
8735280	8741720	The handhelds will now be 150 for the DSI and 170 for the DSI XL.
8741720	8744100	Time to clear out that inventory before the 3DS comes out.
8744100	8746600	It's exactly what this is all about.
8746600	8749600	Price drops have also already happened in the UK and Japan.
8749600	8752020	I believe Australia had one as well.
8752020	8756600	So we're kind of the last one to be able to get on board with this.
8756600	8760680	This is to drive sales during the holiday season for those parents that aren't really
8760680	8763680	up and up on the stuff that's coming out in gaming.
8763680	8768640	And so they will spend their money and buy a DSI XL and then the 3DS will come out and
8768640	8769880	they'll have to buy that too.
8769880	8772280	So it's a win-win.
8772280	8775240	So yay, price drops and all that good stuff.
8775240	8778120	All right, let's move on to the mailbag.
8778120	8782960	Every week you guys send us emails and you know, if we feel like it, we'll read them.
8782960	8787180	No, we all, of course, of course we're going to read emails from you guys.
8787180	8790360	Mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com is the place to send those emails.
8790360	8795360	We're going to have Dark Sakura open up the old mailbag and dive in and pull out a letter
8795360	8804680	right now, but not until I play the music.
8804680	8809720	We actually got two emails, but I figured maybe in two hours I'll check the email, the
8809720	8810720	mailbox again.
8810720	8811720	Sure.
8811720	8812720	Yeah.
8812720	8816120	If you want to send more emails, we'll, we'll check for more emails later on tonight.
8816120	8817120	Sure.
8817120	8818520	Um, first one.
8818520	8819520	Hello.
8819520	8821200	I can finally listen live to your show.
8821200	8823640	OLR starts at 3 AM on Monday in Belgium.
8823640	8825400	Still, I can't call in tonight.
8825400	8826400	I'll wake everyone.
8826400	8827800	Show starts at 11 PM.
8827800	8830320	Anyways, I have a question for Loki.
8830320	8835480	I have all Sega guns, light phaser, menacer, stunner, slash virtua gun, and the dreamcast
8835480	8836480	gun.
8836480	8840400	My problem is that none of these guns, except for the menacer, work on newer TVs.
8840400	8843760	I currently don't have room for an old TV, so I was wondering if I could make these guns
8843760	8846680	work on a modern LCD TV.
8846680	8847680	And I'll just go ahead and close the email.
8847680	8849240	Thanks for a weekly OLR, you guys.
8849240	8850240	You're so awesome.
8850240	8851240	Cyberbeast, Belgium.
8851240	8852240	No, you can't.
8852240	8853240	Sorry.
8853240	8859040	And that's unfortunate, but you're not going to be able to do that because newer guns that
8859040	8865600	they have out now basically kind of have little light sensor bars or some sort of sensor bar
8865600	8868200	that attaches to the TV that you would use.
8868200	8869200	It's like Wii style.
8869200	8875780	Yeah, it's like the Wii or even if you want to go even older school, like the Power Glove.
8875780	8882360	It's basically just something because they can't do the refresh stuff on the TVs anymore,
8882360	8884620	so that's what the solution is now.
8884620	8890320	So unfortunately, you're not going to be able to use those on newer TVs.
8890320	8892320	That should answer the question.
8892320	8893320	Last email.
8893320	8894320	Hey guys.
8894320	8895760	Molten Brown here.
8895760	8899040	I was just- Ew.
8899040	8900840	It could be chocolate.
8900840	8901840	I hope so.
8901840	8905680	I was just listening to your last show and I wanted to take a shot at figuring out THQ's
8905680	8907200	warped reasoning.
8907200	8910900	Perhaps to THQ, the amount that they sell to their distributors depends on how many
8910900	8912940	people will buy the game new.
8912940	8916760	Since the distributors will only buy what they think they will be able to sell.
8916760	8920480	If the distributors are having a hard time unloading the new game because people are
8920480	8925080	buying it used, then they will decrease the amount of new games they buy from the producers.
8925080	8928480	This means that in the end, THQ and other producers will get less money since distributors
8928480	8930160	are buying less of their game.
8930160	8935160	While I don't agree with this reasoning, nor THQ's stance towards used gamers, I can-
8935160	8938760	I'm thinking of used gamers, like the gamers themselves being used.
8938760	8939760	I can-
8939760	8941400	I feel so used today.
8941400	8942400	I'm stent.
8942400	8945440	I can buy this program.
8945440	8950040	I can kind of see where they are coming from since they are in the business to make money.
8950040	8953040	Sad though it is, that's what it boils down to.
8953040	8957560	Well, keep up the good work and hopefully next time I will be awake enough to send a
8957560	8959300	longer email with some questions.
8959300	8961320	Your dutiful listener, Molten Brown.
8961320	8963120	The not gross version of Molten Brown.
8963120	8968180	Sadly, I don't think that's the case at all and here's why I don't think that.
8968180	8972760	Because the first game that they pulled that on was UFC 2010.
8972760	8978200	And really, they wouldn't have announced it to anybody until the day the game was released,
8978200	8984940	except the fact that Destructoid got a hold of, you know, I guess a source of somebody
8984940	8989280	who purchased the game before the street date and found out that it had this whole thing
8989280	8990280	on there anyways.
8990280	8992440	They weren't going to tell anybody about it until last minute.
8992440	8997160	Now, if the whole thing was to drive up sales of new products, they would have had to let
8997160	9002200	everybody know right away or at least a lot earlier than the street date in order to get
9002200	9009000	people to say, oh well, if I can't buy it used and connect online and have to pay this
9009000	9012440	extra money, I need to go buy it new now.
9012440	9015660	If that's their plan to drive sales up, really it's not.
9015660	9020500	It's all about them getting some extra money for selling a used title.
9020500	9024920	Really something that they really shouldn't have money for in the first place because
9024920	9030040	if you are, you know, buying the game new, well, someone's got to buy the game new at
9030040	9033800	one point and in that case, you know, the money that they would have made from that
9033800	9037200	sale would go to, you know, supporting the online stuff.
9037200	9041080	If someone else say, you know, if I happen to give my game to somebody else to play,
9041080	9046720	why should they have to pay an extra $10 to basically take up as much space on their network
9046720	9048200	as I was previously?
9048200	9050600	I don't see the point.
9050600	9055700	All it is is just a cash grab and they claim it's to make their online service better,
9055700	9062760	but if you can't, you know, if you can't make your online service better within the $60
9062760	9065280	price point, then you need to raise the price of your games.
9065280	9069920	Whether that's popular or not with your consumers, that's the risk you're going to have to take
9069920	9074040	if that's really an issue for you, but really it doesn't come down to making their service
9074040	9078120	better because as far as I'm aware, the UFC stuff, I don't think they've really done anything
9078120	9081040	to their online service, made it really awesome.
9081040	9084280	I don't think anyone's going, oh my God, the online UFC is so sweet.
9084280	9086560	This is way better than every other game I've ever played.
9086560	9089400	I don't think that's the case at all and I don't think that's ever going to be the case
9089400	9090440	with this stuff.
9090440	9094880	It's just an excuse that they're using to try to justify charging you an extra $10 if
9094880	9096720	you buy the game used.
9096720	9102840	So Break Man in their chat room says, quite simply, if that's a plan to drive up sales,
9102840	9103840	it's not a very good plan.
9103840	9104840	Yeah.
9104840	9114480	Because if that was their intent was to drive up new sales, because the way it works, it
9114480	9119600	goes either you're going to have your direct consumers or your direct retailers that you're
9119600	9124000	working with, like the Game Stops and whatever, or the distributors that they're working with.
9124000	9129280	So either way, they have customers that need to place orders with those companies, then
9129280	9134080	those companies say, okay, we have X number of pieces on order, here's how many pieces
9134080	9140040	we think we need, what we have on order plus a little bit of extra of a pad to sell later
9140040	9141040	on.
9141040	9142960	And that's what they place with the actual publisher.
9142960	9149120	If their intent was on driving up new game sales, then they would have let that news
9149120	9153420	out a lot earlier so that people would go, oh, okay, well then they need to buy a new
9153420	9160240	version of this game instead so that I can get my online content for no additional price,
9160240	9164720	which really doesn't make any sense anyways.
9164720	9168200	So they would have to do that in order for that to actually be true.
9168200	9176180	But they didn't, and now they're even talking about raising the price from $5 to $10.
9176180	9179760	So I think it's just a big old cash grab.
9179760	9180880	That's all it is.
9180880	9185440	At some point, the video game market is going to crash under the weight of all this.
9185440	9187460	It's because they think they need some extra money.
9187460	9191680	They think that, oh, hey, well we can make money off of each use sale because these damn
9191680	9195240	use sales, they're cutting into our new game sales.
9195240	9199360	Well, I don't know if that's the case at all because I think a lot of people that are planning
9199360	9203520	on buying those use games weren't going to buy your game new anyways.
9203520	9204520	Exactly.
9204520	9205520	Exactly.
9205520	9211200	And so regardless of the fact that you don't have online or online's extra or something
9211200	9215440	like that, they may just say, you know what, I don't need that game at all, and then they'll
9215440	9219440	be resentful against you and not buy your product going forward.
9219440	9221080	So it may have a negative impact.
9221080	9224760	And I think overall, it's not a really good move, but a lot of people are going to move
9224760	9226280	that direction anyways.
9226280	9228280	All right.
9228280	9234120	Let's move on to, I guess, appropriately following up all this ranting, a segment we do here
9234120	9255000	on the show every week called the FUs of the week, FU to having to take algebra.
9255000	9259640	Not that it's a hard class, just that I hate math.
9259640	9264000	FU to people that drive really slow in front of me or that are lost and don't seem to know
9264000	9265000	where they're going.
9265000	9268620	I like, I hate people that all of a sudden just cut over a couple lanes because they
9268620	9269620	miss their turn.
9269620	9270620	You know what?
9270620	9274600	If you miss your turn, you need to make a U-turn and then correct it that way instead
9274600	9279320	of just going, Oh my God, and cutting off everybody.
9279320	9283560	I don't really have a lot of angst, so I'll go with the driver FU to FU to SUV that totally
9283560	9285640	cut me off merging on an I-80 today.
9285640	9287640	She was a bitch.
9287640	9288640	Alan?
9288640	9291760	Uh, FU to hot weather, I guess.
9291760	9292760	I don't know.
9292760	9293760	I'm pretty mellow right now.
9293760	9295040	It's cause you live in Silent Hill.
9295040	9296040	I do.
9296040	9297040	Where it's always cold.
9297040	9298040	Yes.
9298040	9299040	And I'm not lying.
9299040	9300640	When you drive up the hill to get to Alan's house, it suddenly gets foggy.
9300640	9302640	It could be the middle of August and it's like fog.
9302640	9304640	Bradley, how you doing over there?
9304640	9305640	Do you have a nephew?
9305640	9306640	I have a nephew.
9306640	9309800	I'll have no free time starting Wednesday again for a few months.
9309800	9310800	Why is that?
9310800	9312400	Oh, my second job starts up again.
9312400	9313400	Oh, good times.
9313400	9314400	Good times.
9314400	9315400	All right.
9315400	9316400	Good luck.
9316400	9317400	All right.
9317400	9320000	That's it for the FUs of the week.
9320000	9323840	A few more news stories and then we'll get into your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
9323840	9328240	Won't be the first time tonight we'll be taking calls, but we will take some calls.
9328240	9329240	All right.
9329240	9331240	Uh, Loki, what do you got?
9331240	9335280	Um, Retro City Rampage is a game that they're showing off at PAX right now.
9335280	9340480	It's a WiiWare game that originally was supposed to be an NES title that was gonna be a port
9340480	9345920	of Grand Theft Auto 3, but then something happened where that didn't end up coming out.
9345920	9354040	Now it's kind of a Grand Theft Auto 1 and 2 type of game, but it's now just all sorts
9354040	9357120	of references for different 8-bit games that are in here.
9357120	9361360	It's supposed to be coming out on WiiWare in December, but I mean they have everything
9361360	9368820	from Contra references to Metal Gear to just all sorts of neat gameplay.
9368820	9372760	It just looks really cool and it's all done in kind of an 8-bit style.
9372760	9378040	And once again, actually that was the Grand Theft Auto 3 that ran on the NES is called
9378040	9383160	Project Grand Theft Endo was the original thing.
9383160	9387480	But it's really, really cool.
9387480	9389560	So definitely worth checking out once it comes out.
9389560	9393560	Hope it does actually come to Xbox Live Arcade or PlayStation Network as they were saying.
9393560	9400000	So that looks like a sweet game.
9400000	9401200	It actually does look really sweet.
9401200	9404800	I like those games that kind of like get in the retro, although I don't know, I wasn't
9404800	9407760	super duper into the Scott Pilgrim game for some reason.
9407760	9413600	Like it was okay, but maybe I didn't, I don't think I played enough of it actually, so I
9413600	9414600	don't know.
9414600	9416600	You're going to be picking this up though, Loki?
9416600	9420920	Yeah, I haven't really played the Wii in a long time, but I, I definitely.
9420920	9423360	Mine's still not, I didn't even buy the new Metroid.
9423360	9426760	I know that might be like shocking in awe, but I'm kind of just waiting for it to come
9426760	9428920	out on Xbox 360.
9428920	9433160	Like in my mind, I'm like, it'll come out on the 360 at some point.
9433160	9434160	Right.
9434160	9435160	Or the PS3.
9435160	9436160	I know.
9436160	9437160	I know.
9437160	9440200	I'm being stupid right now, but yeah, that's it.
9440200	9443680	And Rama's yelling at me saying, you need to play more Scott Pilgrim.
9443680	9444680	I know.
9444680	9445680	I do.
9445680	9446680	All right.
9446680	9451600	Going on to a one more story before the calls, you guys, uh, the fast racing league is something
9451600	9452720	coming out on WiiWare.
9452720	9455440	It's the futuristic fast racing league.
9455440	9456560	Hmm.
9456560	9457720	What could this be?
9457720	9463160	It's a jet rocket, I guess is the, uh, folks that make the game or is this, no, no, it's,
9463160	9465000	uh, that's the other game they made.
9465000	9467120	Shinen is the name of the company.
9467120	9470640	Uh, they're making this game, a game called fast racing league.
9470640	9472520	All there is is promotion art.
9472520	9474920	Uh, but there you go.
9474920	9479200	My thought when I look at this though, is that, gee, somebody's making F zero for the
9479200	9480200	Wii.
9480200	9482080	It's that they're not just calling it F zero.
9482080	9484400	It's it's fast racing league.
9484400	9486200	It looks like wipe out to me.
9486200	9487200	Super fast.
9487200	9491600	Well, wipe out's kind of like F zero in a way.
9491600	9492600	Yeah.
9492600	9495160	It's, it's all the same type of stuff, but I mean the vehicle design looks like wipe
9495160	9496160	out.
9496160	9497160	You know what though?
9497160	9500320	They need to be able to play that perfectly as a negcon.
9500320	9501320	Seriously.
9501320	9504200	Nothing is like playing wipe out with a negcon.
9504200	9505200	There you go.
9505200	9510440	All right, we're going to go to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on
9510440	9512080	Skype is orange lounge radio.
9512080	9515280	You can go ahead and give us a call and we'll be taking your calls.
9515280	9518520	Usually this is the part of the show where I would go to last minute stories, but, um,
9518520	9522240	we actually are tabling those tonight because we still have more stories coming up during
9522240	9523240	the marathon.
9523240	9527240	Everything that was bumped tonight is coming up later during our marathon, so we'll get
9527240	9530480	into that unless there's any late breaking news from this morning.
9530480	9532520	I don't know if Loki has anything he wants to share from that.
9532520	9537360	I guess we could do that, but otherwise we're just waiting for the calls to come in at 1-877-GAME-OLR
9537360	9542280	or our username on Skype is orange lounge radio and we'll be taking your calls.
9542280	9547120	This is probably not the first time tonight that the Skype line will be open, uh, but
9547120	9548120	it's open right now.
9548120	9549120	So there you go.
9549120	9552920	The Borderlands level caps going up from 61 to 69.
9552920	9554040	Nice for free.
9554040	9555520	Why isn't Borderlands an MMO?
9555520	9562360	Usually when I hear about level caps going up, I go, Oh, it's like an MMO, uh, although
9562360	9565120	Borderlands kind of plays like a Warcraft type game, doesn't it?
9565120	9568080	Except it's like first person, but like, doesn't it have like the whole like exclamation marks
9568080	9569800	over people's heads and all that stuff.
9569800	9575120	And you've, you've played this game a little bit, right on your Borderlands is pretty much
9575120	9578160	like Diablo of Diablo was a first person shooter.
9578160	9581720	You know, you shoot someone and the number of how much damage you do and hit points appears
9581720	9582720	over their head.
9582720	9588760	A loot is random, so you've got to go through all the loot that you get and drop the trash.
9588760	9589760	It is pretty fun.
9589760	9590760	Yeah.
9590760	9595680	I was really glad to hear that I gearbox makers of Borderlands got the Duke Nukem forever
9595680	9599240	contract because I'm a huge fan of theirs because they're the ones.
9599240	9600240	See?
9600240	9601240	Yeah.
9601240	9602240	I forgot that they made Borderlands.
9602240	9603240	Oh, well.
9603240	9606480	Borderlands or a Duke Nukem forever is going to be fucking awesome then.
9606480	9607480	Yeah.
9607480	9614040	Cause they did the half-life blue shift and half-life, um, the one with the Marine, the,
9614040	9617600	for the, the other expansion I'm blanking right now, I'm a huge half-life Stan.
9617600	9621600	So anything that gearbox does, cause they're sort of a part of the valve family, I'm going
9621600	9625240	to be all for.
9625240	9626800	Whereas I don't think I've played a lot of their games.
9626800	9627800	I'm not sure.
9627800	9628800	All right, we're getting some calls.
9628800	9630280	We're going to go to the Skype line and see what's up.
9630280	9631440	Hi, you're on orange launch radio.
9631440	9632440	Who's this?
9632440	9633440	Hey, it's Ron.
9633440	9635560	I just want to know, is it happy hour yet?
9635560	9636560	Not yet.
9636560	9637560	I'm still waiting for my drink.
9637560	9640720	I'm supposed to get an hour and a half ago, but that's okay.
9640720	9641720	It's all good.
9641720	9642720	You're still waiting?
9642720	9643720	I already started.
9643720	9644720	Did you?
9644720	9645720	What's the drink of choice for you right now, Rama?
9645720	9648280	It says I have to grill tomorrow.
9648280	9650760	I've been doing nothing but rum and Pepsi all night.
9650760	9652080	So you have to grill tomorrow?
9652080	9653080	What is that?
9653080	9654080	I, I didn't know you were a chef.
9654080	9657400	I thought you worked at like a retail store.
9657400	9660880	I haven't worked retail in about three, four months.
9660880	9662200	You're at a restaurant now?
9662200	9664280	No, I'm talking about tomorrow.
9664280	9665840	I'm breaking out my grill.
9665840	9667440	Oh, Labor Day barbecue.
9667440	9668440	I get it.
9668440	9669440	Yes.
9669440	9670440	I'm just, I'm just slow.
9670440	9671440	Hi, Dan.
9671440	9672440	Oh, Dan just walked into studio.
9672440	9673440	How you doing, Dan?
9673440	9674440	Oh, Lord.
9674440	9675440	I'm doing good.
9675440	9676440	Good.
9676440	9677560	Are you going to be joining us for more of the marathon later on this evening as we move
9677560	9679160	on and take over your house for a night?
9679160	9681560	I don't think I have much of a choice.
9681560	9682560	Awesome.
9682560	9683560	Sounds great.
9683560	9684560	Yes.
9684560	9685560	All right.
9685560	9687360	So what types of games should we play a little bit during the marathon tonight?
9687360	9688840	At some point, I think we're going to move into the vault.
9688840	9689840	I don't know.
9689840	9690840	We're out in the living room.
9690840	9691840	I don't know what dark soccer has.
9691840	9693120	I told Dan to hook up Saturn for me.
9693120	9694120	All right.
9694120	9695120	The Saturn's hooked up.
9695120	9696120	Woo.
9696120	9697360	It's in the vault.
9697360	9698360	What are you going to play on the Saturn?
9698360	9699360	Big TV.
9699360	9700360	All right.
9700360	9701360	Anyhow.
9701360	9702360	I'm playing Xbox on the big TV.
9702360	9703360	All right.
9703360	9704360	I got to get back to the call.
9704360	9705360	We'll talk more of Dan later.
9705360	9706360	Yes.
9706360	9707360	Stay back.
9707360	9708360	All right.
9708360	9709360	Yes.
9709360	9710360	Sounds good.
9710360	9714360	Boy, last week's show was interesting.
9714360	9715360	Anyhow.
9715360	9717280	So what, what's interesting?
9717280	9721640	What's on your mind today, Rama, besides the whole happy hour?
9721640	9724440	I'm actually a little bit pissed at some of the people today.
9724440	9728960	I'm really pissed at people that are bitching about the $10 price increase on Xbox Live.
9728960	9731760	Why are you mad at them?
9731760	9735240	You're only paying $60 a year for this.
9735240	9738320	I understand why the price is going up.
9738320	9742520	Microsoft is actually putting the money into the infrastructure for improvements.
9742520	9746080	In order to make those improvements, something has to go up.
9746080	9750200	Unlike these other software companies who are trying to jack extra money out of us because
9750200	9754920	of used games, they can kiss my ass for all I care, but that's besides the point.
9754920	9755920	Yeah.
9755920	9761000	I was going to say, you know, I'm, I, it feels like we're getting nickeled and dimed in every
9761000	9762160	possible place here.
9762160	9766300	And it's like, I'm okay with Microsoft raising the price because they haven't in so long
9766300	9768640	and they've been supporting it fairly decently.
9768640	9771880	But then when I hear this online pass stuff is being allowed too, I get irritated.
9771880	9774320	You know what I mean?
9774320	9775320	Exactly.
9775320	9781280	And if people are complaining about it, like you said, buy the cards now or do what I do,
9781280	9782860	join reward zone.
9782860	9784080	They have a gamers club.
9784080	9786360	You buy games, you get points.
9786360	9790000	When you hit 150 bucks, you get a $10 gift card.
9790000	9792160	Use that toward your, your, your live.
9792160	9794640	You save 10 bucks that way.
9794640	9798680	So try to find different ways to exploit reward systems and point cards and all that good
9798680	9799680	stuff, right?
9799680	9800680	Yeah, exactly.
9800680	9803520	Plus, Microsoft does do a buck a month deals.
9803520	9804520	Those have popped up.
9804520	9805520	Oh, that's true.
9805520	9806520	Huh?
9806520	9807520	I think I've seen those.
9807520	9808520	Yeah.
9808520	9813800	I saw it pop up on my dashboard on April fool's and I tweeted about everyone thought I was
9813800	9814800	lying about.
9814800	9816200	I'm like, no, this is legit.
9816200	9818000	Here's a screen cap.
9818000	9820060	Interesting question from Derek H in our chat room.
9820060	9823180	What are the odds that when reach comes out, there will be problems connecting because
9823180	9825680	Xbox live is overloaded.
9825680	9828800	Then we'll see just how good their infrastructure is, right?
9828800	9833480	I haven't seen it go down yet, you know, so I don't think there will be much of an issue.
9833480	9835360	I'm trying to think if it ever has gone down.
9835360	9838400	Has Xbox live ever gone down in a non pre-planned way?
9838400	9839720	I'm sure it has for a little bit.
9839720	9840720	Yeah.
9840720	9841720	There was a few times.
9841720	9842720	Never like anything too Epic.
9842720	9843720	Right.
9843720	9844960	It was always a weird times too.
9844960	9845960	Wasn't it?
9845960	9847200	It was like around new years or something.
9847200	9850080	I think this year it was having issues.
9850080	9851440	I will be interested to see though.
9851440	9857160	I mean, he, Derek has a point if, if it goes down, then this whole fact that they're, you
9857160	9860720	know, charging the extra money to improve their infrastructure is kind of a line, isn't
9860720	9861720	it?
9861720	9862720	Well, yeah.
9862720	9867600	It's not because, um, you're really not going to be adding too many people to the actual
9867600	9868600	live service.
9868600	9870400	You're just going to have people playing a different game.
9870400	9873280	And Derek says it happened with Halo three and Halo two.
9873280	9878760	I don't remember it happening with Halo three, but then again, not to like sound beat sound
9878760	9882600	like that guy, but I had it a couple of days early, so I was playing it a little bit earlier.
9882600	9887240	So maybe I didn't notice it, but sometimes they try to do outages in advance to plan
9887240	9888240	for this stuff.
9888240	9889240	But yeah.
9889240	9892920	And I do remember a couple of times Major Nelson said, there's been issues with live
9892920	9895680	and within an hour or two, everything is back to normal.
9895680	9897680	So, you know,
9897680	9901960	Cause they know they're going to have to get hell, uh, with all these people paying for
9901960	9907680	it, which, you know, uh, whereas the PlayStation, uh, if you know, stuff goes down for them
9907680	9908880	and it's free anyway.
9908880	9909880	Right?
9909880	9910880	Yeah.
9910880	9911880	Yeah.
9911880	9915360	Also there was, there was one time, a few times on like a, uh, one versus a hundred
9915360	9917040	where they had problems with that.
9917040	9918040	Oh really?
9918040	9919040	Yeah.
9919040	9923240	And it was kind of weird that was doing that because they had like a, like in their beta
9923240	9927080	seasons had like 150,000 at one time and it was working fine probably back then.
9927080	9930760	But it was like 50,000 that it was coming in for a time and it didn't work for like
9930760	9931760	two weeks.
9931760	9932760	Interesting.
9932760	9933760	I don't remember that.
9933760	9935860	But then again, I was kind of one of those people that played it more when it first came
9935860	9939080	out and then like later on I was like, oh, it'll always be here.
9939080	9940080	I'll just play it next time.
9940080	9941560	And then, oh, now it's gone.
9941560	9942560	No more of that.
9942560	9943560	Yeah.
9943560	9944560	Forget that.
9944560	9948640	That's one thing I would hope with this extra $10 is they'd add something that's like that
9948640	9949880	to replace it.
9949880	9954320	That is a damn good point is that, you know, they took away one versus a hundred and you
9954320	9957240	know, they're going to be charging more for Xbox live.
9957240	9960680	Like if they brought something awesome like that back, like more of these interactive
9960680	9963520	live shows, I charged me 20 more.
9963520	9966120	Well, you know what I think would be a benefit.
9966120	9967120	Huh?
9967120	9971560	I'm going to take that thing and shove it up your butt.
9971560	9975000	Come on.
9975000	9978360	I figured we had to have at least once during the marathon.
9978360	9979360	You know what?
9979360	9980560	Oh, what?
9980560	9985600	I've decided that I am so sick of dark Sakura always having her stupid vuvuzilla button
9985600	9990680	here on the program that what I've decided to do is that I've actually, um, decided to
9990680	10000720	counter dark Sakura a little bit here and uh, I actually have my stadium vuvuzilla noise.
10000720	10001720	You are such a dork.
10001720	10005520	So we can have dueling vuvuzillas on the show.
10005520	10006520	That's going to be amazing.
10006520	10007520	We'll duet Rob.
10007520	10008520	Great.
10008520	10009520	I'm sure the listeners are so excited.
10009520	10013520	Well, I am glad they do look for it.
10013520	10016520	It's a band, that thing.
10016520	10018520	Turn off.
10018520	10020520	There we go.
10020520	10021520	All right.
10021520	10022520	It won't shut up.
10022520	10023520	All right.
10023520	10024520	Rama, anything else you want to share with us for now?
10024520	10028000	I'm sure you'll call in later, but you know, well, if you want, I have another story.
10028000	10031480	I can say that when I called back later, actually, we're supposed to be doing an outbound call
10031480	10032480	right now.
10032480	10035840	So, um, I'm going to let you go for now, but call in later and give us that story because
10035840	10039480	we do still have more stories too that we're going to talk about a little later.
10039480	10040480	Wonderful.
10040480	10041480	Great.
10041480	10042480	All right.
10042480	10043480	Talk to you later.
10043480	10044480	Be more drunk.
10044480	10045480	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
10045480	10046480	Bye bye.
10046480	10047480	Bye.
10047480	10048480	All right.
10048480	10049480	We're going to hold off on calls for a minute because we're actually going to make an outbound
10049480	10050480	call.
10050480	10056200	It is now five o'clock Pacific and yeah, we're three hours in and usually at this time there's
10056200	10060400	another man live at All Games Radio and some people might be tuning in to try and hear
10060400	10062200	him, but you can't.
10062200	10063200	He's not live tonight.
10063200	10069080	The man is Bobby Black Wolf, the host of the Bobby Black Wolf show here on All Games Radio
10069080	10073280	and he's not live tonight cause he's at Dragon Con this weekend.
10073280	10077480	So sorry fans of Bobby who don't listen to us.
10077480	10080720	Uh, you don't get Bobby tonight or do you?
10080720	10084160	We're going to call him right now actually and try to get him on the show so he can have
10084160	10086120	a mini Bobby Black Wolf show.
10086120	10091120	So two ringy dingys.
10091120	10094840	Hey Bobby, how are you doing?
10094840	10096800	It's your buddy Rob from Orange Launch Radio.
10096800	10098400	Hey, I'm doing great.
10098400	10100720	How are, how are you guys holding up?
10100720	10101720	That's what?
10101720	10102720	Hour three?
10102720	10103720	Good.
10103720	10104720	Yes.
10104720	10105720	We're in hour three.
10105720	10108560	We got started a little bit late cause weird server problems at All Games and I know Scott's
10108560	10111880	at Burning Man and all these other things are going on, but it just magically started
10111880	10113120	working at two.
10113120	10116760	So I'm not sure if somebody must have put it on a schedule or something and we tried
10116760	10117760	to take it.
10117760	10119320	It's on a schedule.
10119320	10120640	It may cut you off later.
10120640	10121640	I don't know.
10121640	10122640	Oh, great.
10122640	10123640	Just what we needed.
10123640	10124640	Yeah.
10124640	10126720	Who knows how long the marathon will be going tonight.
10126720	10130400	It'll when All Games Radio decides to cut it off, we'll be done I guess.
10130400	10131400	We'll see what happens.
10131400	10132400	All right.
10132400	10133400	Right.
10133400	10134400	Try to tweet channel Z.
10134400	10135400	All right.
10135400	10136400	We'll see.
10136400	10137400	All right.
10137400	10140640	Well, I figured, you know, since you're not able to do a show here live at All Games Radio
10140640	10145080	cause A you're gone and B we took over, I thought maybe you'd want to do the mini Bobby
10145080	10146080	Black Wolf show.
10146080	10147080	Sure.
10147080	10150840	I mean, I, well then I can talk about what's been going on here at Dragon Con and some
10150840	10154600	of the neat stuff that I've done and something that we're actually going to be running next
10154600	10158880	week, which I didn't even know.
10158880	10159880	Hold on.
10159880	10160880	This is very important.
10160880	10161880	Breaking news here at the OLR marathon.
10161880	10163600	I believe I've been given a glass of liquor.
10163600	10164600	What is this?
10164600	10165600	This is my first booze of the evening.
10165600	10166600	What is this?
10166600	10170760	It's a double shot of tequila and, uh, um, it better be Patron.
10170760	10171760	It is.
10171760	10172760	Okay.
10172760	10173760	Okay.
10173760	10174760	Okay.
10174760	10175760	Good.
10175760	10176760	Good.
10176760	10180600	And it's a pea grapefruit juice.
10180600	10181600	That's a tasty beverage.
10181600	10182600	All right.
10182600	10183600	I'm making more.
10183600	10184600	Who wants one?
10184600	10185600	Sorry, Bobby.
10185600	10186600	I just, um,
10186600	10187600	Oh, there's beverages here.
10187600	10188600	Don't worry.
10188600	10189600	I don't feel left out.
10189600	10190600	Yeah.
10190600	10193800	I was going to say you, you sound like you're either kind of tired or maybe, maybe you've
10193800	10195320	had a beverage or two yourself.
10195320	10196320	I don't know.
10196320	10197320	Have you, have you?
10197320	10198800	I actually haven't had a beverage today.
10198800	10204280	I found a quiet place kind of to be, and then I realized the quiet place is right next to
10204280	10206880	security operations for the hotel.
10206880	10209160	So I'm kind of trying to keep it down a little bit.
10209160	10210160	Ah, I see.
10210160	10211160	Okay.
10211160	10212160	All right.
10212160	10213160	Well, what's Dragon, what's going on at Dragon Con?
10213160	10215560	I know you want to tell us a little bit about what's going on over there at the show and
10215560	10218040	some of the stuff you got for your own show next week.
10218040	10223400	Well, basically, I mean, Dragon Con, it's, it's a big, it's, you know, it's, take Comic
10223400	10226200	Con and take out really a lot of like the industry stuff.
10226200	10228200	This is a fan convention.
10228200	10230120	There are a lot of celebrities here.
10230120	10233480	Um, I haven't stood in line for any of those panels or anything.
10233480	10237040	I've actually been here trying, you know, staying away from video games, staying away
10237040	10238360	from computers.
10238360	10242560	The game I actually been playing most recently, I don't know if you've ever played this game.
10242560	10246560	It's a, it's a card slash role playing game called are you a werewolf?
10246560	10247840	Have you ever played that?
10247840	10249560	No, but it sounds interesting.
10249560	10253040	Loki, are you a werewolf?
10253040	10254040	It goes by another name.
10254040	10255040	Some people know it as mafia.
10255040	10256040	It's the same rules.
10256040	10259120	Oh God, we, I have played a game like this.
10259120	10262160	It's um, no, when I played it, it was just called werewolf.
10262160	10263840	It's a very popular foreign game, right?
10263840	10267120	It's the thing where, um, like you have a group of 12 people, right?
10267120	10272160	And like three of them are wolves and like every night the, everybody votes to lynch
10272160	10273700	one person.
10273700	10276200	And if the wolves are the last people standing, they win.
10276200	10278200	But if the, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, they win.
10278200	10279200	Yes.
10279200	10283920	I've, I've, I've said this game play before, that's from 2am to 9am.
10283920	10284920	Okay.
10284920	10288800	And then I, and then I sleep a little bit and about one o'clock I get up and go to the
10288800	10290680	dealer's room and stuff like that.
10290680	10293720	Uh, so that's really what I've been doing is staying away from video games.
10293720	10295680	There is a video game room here.
10295680	10301120	They do have consoles here that people can check out games, use games from the game store
10301120	10302480	that's running it from Tennessee.
10302480	10306320	Um, but really it's not really the focus of DragonCon.
10306320	10312240	There are no game companies exhibiting here, so it's, there's not that much video game
10312240	10314560	type stuff going on here.
10314560	10317240	However, and this is the cool thing.
10317240	10320160	I just got an interview, which we're going to run on my show next week, which by the
10320160	10321920	way guys is 25 minutes long.
10321920	10322920	Woohoo.
10322920	10327960	Do you remember, did you ever remember in Dave and Buster, the BattleTech centers?
10327960	10328960	Absolutely.
10328960	10334160	Dan absolutely loved that thing and he was pissed when it was taken out.
10334160	10339520	I have the entire story on why it was taken out and where all those pods went because
10339520	10345560	there are eight BattleTech pods downstairs, 24 hours right here at DragonCon.
10345560	10346840	Oh wow.
10346840	10347840	That's awesome.
10347840	10349640	And they are still making updates.
10349640	10353040	The game actually looks a lot like MechWarrior 4 on the PC now.
10353040	10355920	They're actually, the software company is still working on new updates.
10355920	10359520	They're going to bring back Red Planet very soon as well.
10359520	10364720	You know, um, and uh, I got the story of, you know, where they travel and uh, you know,
10364720	10369440	because basically Enthusiast bought all the pods after Dave and Busters canceled the contract.
10369440	10373960	And the short story is Dave and Busters decided that they no longer wanted to have anybody
10373960	10375280	working the Midway.
10375280	10377040	Everything had to be self-sustaining.
10377040	10381360	And so the BattleTech, they decided did not renew the contract with Virtual World.
10381360	10385520	So they were going to sell all the pods and all these Enthusiasts came together and said,
10385520	10387720	we'll buy this set and this set.
10387720	10391240	And now all the sets are all over the country and some of them are mobile now.
10391240	10392240	Wow.
10392240	10393240	Huh.
10393240	10400200	And I, so I have a 25 minute interview with an owner of one of a set of 16 pods, eight
10400200	10403320	of which are traveling, eight of which are in a center in Houston.
10403320	10408160	Uh, and we talk about, you know, what, because he was just a player and they got the funds
10408160	10409160	together to buy it.
10409160	10414000	And they traveled the country with these pods and they do maintenance on the hardware and
10414000	10417520	they do the community thing and do the whole BattleTech Center stuff.
10417520	10420200	But they're keeping the BattleTech dream alive.
10420200	10424080	And we're going to have a long, nice, very good interview with him next week on the Bobby
10424080	10425080	Block World Show.
10425080	10426940	I'm excited to hear it.
10426940	10431320	When I was living in Walnut Creek, we had a Virtual World, one of the few that were
10431320	10435800	in California and I used to play a BattleTech in those pods.
10435800	10437560	It's a great time.
10437560	10438780	That made me super motion sick.
10438780	10442280	The one time I tried, I remember playing the Dave and Buster's, I got my butt kicked by
10442280	10443280	Dan, but it was fun.
10443280	10445440	I played that that time too.
10445440	10448520	We were there for one of my birthdays and I was super drunk, but I was really motion
10448520	10449680	sick anyway.
10449680	10453600	But that new Dave and Buster's in Roseville, like if they try to put a BattleTech center
10453600	10455640	there, that would just be the entire place.
10455640	10456640	It would.
10456640	10457640	It's that small.
10457640	10458640	It's Dave and Buster's Jr.
10458640	10460680	Well, that's going to be an awesome interview, Bobby.
10460680	10462440	We're looking forward to that next week.
10462440	10464120	What else is going on at Dragon Con?
10464120	10466560	Did you end up on a panel after all, I heard?
10466560	10467560	What's this?
10467560	10468560	I did.
10468560	10473400	The panel they had put me on was the kickoff panel, which was Friday at one o'clock and
10473400	10476720	I actually had to work until noon.
10476720	10480920	I was all packed and everything and I had left at noon to get down here and the trains
10480920	10484200	were held up a little bit.
10484200	10489520	I actually walked into the back of the panel at 1.15 and the place is packed.
10489520	10492640	They do call me up at about 1.15, 1.20.
10492640	10497080	I haven't even gotten my badge yet because the badge line is five hours long for pre-registration.
10497080	10502120	That's the one thing Dragon Con hasn't figured out is how to pick up your badge.
10502120	10506240	I went up, did the panel, did the last 30 minutes of the panel.
10506240	10507240	The room was packed.
10507240	10509440	Would you like to know why the room was packed, Rob?
10509440	10510440	Why?
10510440	10511440	It wasn't for me.
10511440	10516560	This is the key, if you ever want to have a packed panel, have Veronica Belmont on it
10516560	10518560	with you.
10518560	10519680	Nice.
10519680	10520680	She was there, huh?
10520680	10525160	No, because she was there with the Swords and Lasers podcast is kind of the one.
10525160	10526400	That's her independent podcast.
10526400	10527400	They're here.
10527400	10533640	They actually did a live show in a large ballroom today at four here, but she was on the panel
10533640	10534640	and stuff.
10534640	10540800	I talked a little bit about what we do at all games and stuff like that, but yeah, the
10540800	10542800	place was packed and it's because Veronica was there.
10542800	10546400	When it was over, everybody was rushing to get their pictures with Veronica and all that
10546400	10547400	stuff.
10547400	10549880	I did get to speak on one panel, but that was it.
10549880	10553880	My official obligations were gone in two and I didn't even have my badge yet at the time.
10553880	10557800	One of the few podcasts that I will admit to listening to, because it is pretty good,
10557800	10561320	is The Instance, which is one of the World of Warcraft podcasts that's out there.
10561320	10567440	She was actually on, they recently had a big buku ye hippie hurrah 200th episode, and she
10567440	10569000	was on that.
10569000	10572360	I was kind of like, oh yeah, this is kind of interesting.
10572360	10573360	Yeah.
10573360	10574360	Well, cool.
10574360	10576320	She does a lot of independent stuff.
10576320	10581160	I mean, yeah, she's been hired by CNET, she works for CORE, but she still really loves
10581160	10583920	doing all the independent stuff.
10583920	10584920	She considers it a hobby.
10584920	10585920	That's awesome.
10585920	10588840	It's a good way to do it, good for her.
10588840	10593840	What about, are there any other type of record-breaking things going on there, like no thriller dances
10593840	10595760	this year, or what's going on?
10595760	10600960	Well, they can't do Thriller because the Thriller record is currently 12,000.
10600960	10604800	Mexico City set it to 12,000, so the 900, whatever they did here.
10604800	10608360	I don't know how they did, I mean, obviously, we won't know how they did until Guinness
10608360	10615400	verifies it, but they did two existing records, and they tried to set up a brand new record.
10615400	10619480	The two existing, they wanted the most Star Trek characters in one place, and the most
10619480	10624240	superheroes in one place, and then they created a new one of most theme punk characters in
10624240	10627640	one place, because theme punk's really kind of the new goth.
10627640	10634240	Here at DragonCon, everybody is theme punk, and ears, and all that stuff, so it used to
10634240	10637280	be just Neil Victoria, and then they added all the technology to it.
10637280	10640680	So those are the records that they've been trying to break.
10640680	10644120	But I don't know exactly how those have been going.
10644120	10645120	Sounds like fun, though.
10645120	10646120	Good times.
10646120	10651800	Now, I will say, I did go in the dealer's room, there is a dealer that actually had
10651800	10657920	a lot of, going back to the video game thing, a lot of rare Nintendo games, Super Nintendo
10657920	10660720	games, things like that.
10660720	10664200	He actually had Earthbound for the NES.
10664200	10665200	Oh wow.
10665200	10666200	The cartridge.
10666200	10667200	Oh wow.
10667200	10668200	That's...
10668200	10672760	He was selling it for $130, and I did not get it in time.
10672760	10675840	I came back ready to get it, and somebody else had bought it.
10675840	10678280	Oh, that's awful.
10678280	10683600	But it was the actual limited edition NES release of Earthbound.
10683600	10690480	He's got little Samsung, he's got an NES port test cartridge, so one of the test cartridges
10690480	10694800	that the service centers had, and he's got that for $350, which is a lot more than it
10694800	10697680	ever goes on eBay, but it's very, very rare.
10697680	10708320	But I did buy something from him, Nintendo related, and it's not exactly rare, and once
10708320	10713320	people see exactly what it is, it's not gonna sound as cool as it would when you first see
10713320	10715920	it, but I'm gonna save that for Friday night on Friday Night Gaming.
10715920	10718160	Oh, a little tease there, all right.
10718160	10723800	So Friday Night Gaming, if you wanna check that out this Friday at fnglive.net, right?
10723800	10727360	Yes, and the main game we'll be playing is Metroid Other M.
10727360	10728360	Because it's effing live.
10728360	10732360	But I'll be showing this game that I picked up here at DragonCon for a pretty penny, and
10732360	10735480	I overpaid a little bit, as you can expect, for con prices and stuff.
10735480	10739000	I looked online how much it is, and I could have gotten it online for a lot cheaper.
10739000	10742200	I'll tell you where you can get it once we show it.
10742200	10751480	But yeah, he had all the Mega Man, he had, I can't remember what Super Nintendo games,
10751480	10754720	but he had Little Samson, I guess, is a really rare NES game.
10754720	10757920	You get that in the box, sitting in there.
10757920	10763000	So there's some rare stuff that I found in the dealer's room, and I just can't afford
10763000	10764000	it all.
10764000	10766360	We're actually looking at our chat room at chat.orangelandradiocom.
10766360	10767680	I apologize to Bobby's fans.
10767680	10771280	I kinda have one eye on the all games chat room, but I'm not able to follow.
10771280	10774320	There's a lot of chatty chat going on there right now, but let's see.
10774320	10777960	Breakman says, Earthbound for the NES and Bobby let him keep his life?
10777960	10779960	He got lucky.
10779960	10785080	Well, I bought this other thing first.
10785080	10789440	It was my first priority, and then I came back and it was gone by the time I had come
10789440	10791440	back the next day.
10791440	10794000	That's too bad.
10794000	10797920	You'll have to find the guy who bought it and end his life.
10797920	10798920	No.
10798920	10804480	All right, so if you're the guy that bought the Earthbound on the NES cartridge at Dragon
10804480	10806120	Con, Bobby's looking for you.
10806120	10807120	All right.
10807120	10808120	That's right.
10808120	10809120	I want Earthbound Zero sometime.
10809120	10810120	All right.
10810120	10813620	Well, Bobby, we don't want to keep you up for the convention too much longer, but anything
10813620	10819440	else you want to say about the convention or your show or anything for the folks listening?
10819440	10820440	Not really.
10820440	10822360	I mean, Dragon Con, it's been a fun time.
10822360	10823560	There's a lot of great costumes.
10823560	10826400	I have not seen Brad from pot culture yet.
10826400	10827400	I know he's here.
10827400	10831120	He's out having dinner somewhere tonight, so I didn't get to...
10831120	10837240	I haven't been able to say hi to him, but I mean, no, and here's the great thing, Rob.
10837240	10838840	They moved PAX next year.
10838840	10839840	Did you notice that?
10839840	10840840	No.
10840840	10842760	PAX got moved.
10842760	10844760	I did not.
10844760	10846480	It's back to its original weekend.
10846480	10849280	It is the last weekend of August next year.
10849280	10851160	It is not Labor Day weekend.
10851160	10852160	It's the weekend before.
10852160	10853160	Interesting.
10853160	10854160	Flights are cheaper.
10854160	10855160	That'll be good.
10855160	10856160	Yeah.
10856160	10857160	Flights will be cheaper.
10857160	10858160	It's been a long time.
10858160	10859160	I have to do that next year then.
10859160	10863200	So I'll be able to make it out there and here, and I don't have to worry about which one
10863200	10866880	I'm going to, so I was very happy about that.
10866880	10869480	I've been trying to keep an eye on PAX news and stuff.
10869480	10872840	I'll believe the Duke Nukem for everything when I see it.
10872840	10873840	It's...
10873840	10875080	They've got video from the show floor.
10875080	10876080	It's nuts.
10876080	10877080	I'm just...
10877080	10882500	Then they can say, oh, by the way, yeah, it won't be coming out for another 10 years.
10882500	10886320	But it's the guys who did Borderlands now, and as we were kind of discussing earlier
10886320	10889840	when it was our lead story tonight, as you can probably imagine, we were kind of talking
10889840	10894040	about how it's probably not really the same game 3D Realms was developing.
10894040	10900120	It was just kind of like, okay, well, we've bought this IP from the slaughter of 3D Realms.
10900120	10903700	Let's just take all these art assets and the idea and see what we can do with it, and now
10903700	10906880	you actually have a game, because it's not the same game.
10906880	10907880	Yeah.
10907880	10908880	Let's see.
10908880	10909880	Go ahead.
10909880	10915000	One last thing is I wanted to do my show this week mainly because I wish I was doing it
10915000	10918400	because Microsoft has been showing a hell of a lot of balls this week.
10918400	10919400	How so?
10919400	10922960	With the new controller and the Xbox Live.
10922960	10923960	We have talked about...
10923960	10924960	What was that?
10924960	10925960	Yeah.
10925960	10926960	So we have talked about some of that stuff.
10926960	10927960	Yeah.
10927960	10931360	The limited edition controller or the bundled or whatever controller and the price increases
10931360	10934080	we were just talking about before we had you on.
10934080	10935080	Yeah.
10935080	10936080	Yeah.
10936080	10939680	Microsoft is just showing a lot of balls this week, and I'm like, damn, they had to do this
10939680	10940680	on the week.
10940680	10941680	I'm not doing anything.
10941680	10944720	Let me get some quick questions from our chat room at chat.org.com.
10944720	10948600	G Ripper wants to know, is Glenn there, your partner in crime from FNG Live?
10948600	10949600	No.
10949600	10951280	He is not here.
10951280	10953920	Nobody else from FNG was able to make it up here.
10953920	10958580	Derek H asks, is it true that as Chris Gore said, Dragon Con is a sluttier version of
10958580	10959580	Comic-Con?
10959580	10960580	Probably.
10960580	10961580	Yeah.
10961580	10962580	Yeah.
10962580	10967720	Have you seen a lot of hot sluts?
10967720	10969240	I will make you really answer that.
10969240	10970240	Oh, yeah.
10970240	10971240	Oh, yeah.
10971240	10972240	Here's the thing.
10972240	10973240	Here's the thing, Rob.
10973240	10974840	Here's the thing.
10974840	10975840	What?
10975840	10980840	The saying goes, if you don't get laid at Dragon Con, you're not trying.
10980840	10985800	Yeah, I've heard that those furries can get pretty aggressive.
10985800	10986800	It's like the Ren Faire.
10986800	10990800	Just walk into one of those little gift party rooms and you'll have a good time.
10990800	10993640	Thankfully, I have not seen a single one of them.
10993640	10994640	You haven't seen a furry?
10994640	10997040	Well, because they're all too busy at the orgy.
10997040	10998040	That's why they're...
10998040	10999040	Yes.
10999040	11002880	If you haven't seen a furry, you're not trying hard enough.
11002880	11007440	And they don't need a Craigslist posting to get that going.
11007440	11008440	They can't now.
11008440	11013920	Craigslist has censored the adult services section now on Craigslist, apparently.
11013920	11014920	So there you go.
11014920	11016320	But Pac needed a Craigslist post to do it.
11016320	11017320	You don't need that here.
11017320	11018320	It just happens.
11018320	11019320	All right.
11019320	11021520	Bobby, we're going to let you go.
11021520	11022840	Have fun at Dragon Con.
11022840	11026240	Have a blast, especially for us since we're not there, since it seems like everybody else
11026240	11028420	is going to some convention but us.
11028420	11031120	And we'll have a drink in your honor a little later, all right?
11031120	11032120	Excellent.
11032120	11034240	I'll have a drink in your honor over here, too.
11034240	11035240	Sounds good.
11035240	11036240	All right.
11036240	11037240	Have a good one, Bobby.
11037240	11038240	See you.
11038240	11039240	All right.
11039240	11042600	Bobby Blackwolf, the man who is usually live right now at All Games Radio, but it's a special
11042600	11043600	weekend.
11043600	11044680	It's Labor Day weekend.
11044680	11045680	We're doing a marathon.
11045680	11047320	He's at Dragon Con.
11047320	11049080	Scott's at Burning Man.
11049080	11053280	Most people are at Pac's, but we're right here in the OLR Studios, and boy, aren't we
11053280	11054760	having fun together.
11054760	11058600	Actually, there's quite a few of you listening tonight, so I really appreciate that.
11058600	11060720	It looks like you guys are with us here.
11060720	11063240	So we're going to keep going and take some more calls.
11063240	11066520	1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLawnTradial.
11066520	11070040	We'll get in at least a couple more calls before the next break and before we say goodbye
11070040	11073440	to Loki for the night, and then we'll... I don't know what we'll do.
11073440	11076800	I'm thinking maybe for the next segment, Dark Sakura, I told you we should think of this.
11076800	11081680	Maybe we'll go into the vault and just pull some random games and talk about them.
11081680	11082680	Okay.
11082680	11084720	Like maybe like gaming memories or whatever.
11084720	11085720	Okay.
11085720	11087960	But we also... We need to take the chat room into the vault somehow.
11087960	11089520	Do we have a laptop or anything?
11089520	11091320	I got... Why am I not in the car?
11091320	11092320	Yeah.
11092320	11093320	I can do that.
11093320	11094320	Okay.
11094320	11095320	Do you know that you have the password to your Wi-Fi so we can...
11095320	11096320	Yes.
11096320	11097320	Okay.
11097320	11098320	Good.
11098320	11099320	Good deal.
11099320	11100320	We'll do that.
11100320	11101320	And then you get to hear what it is.
11101320	11103560	Do they have like an app or something on the iPhone that you can do like a Justin TV or
11103560	11104560	something?
11104560	11106720	There is... Yes.
11106720	11109120	I have a Ustream.
11109120	11112400	We've actually had for several years, and I guess now's the time to say it.
11112400	11114200	We've had a secret Ustream channel.
11114200	11115200	It's not that secret.
11115200	11121080	It's just that before we went to Justin TV, literally the week before, I reserved a Ustream
11121080	11122080	for us.
11122080	11126160	But we opted to go with Justin TV because that's where the All Games Network went.
11126160	11130280	And it seemed like most of the folks in the shows that we're related to and so forth all
11130280	11131760	went towards Justin TV.
11131760	11137040	So we went there for the whole Synergy thing because it was kind of the same thing.
11137040	11142120	Now that that isn't really the case anymore, there's... Some of our fans still broadcast
11142120	11145240	on Justin TV, and I think that's really cool.
11145240	11148040	But I did get a Ustream application for the phone.
11148040	11152840	I actually did a test run the other night just to see how well it worked.
11152840	11158200	The video quality's kind of poop, but it does let you stream over 3G.
11158200	11160360	So it's kind of neat in that regard.
11160360	11161360	So I don't know.
11161360	11162360	Maybe we'll broadcast.
11162360	11166960	But I just... I think the video quality is such poop, and we're a radio show.
11166960	11168520	I don't know if it's really worth it, to be honest.
11168520	11172320	If you associate your iPhone with the Wi-Fi here, would the app then associate with the
11172320	11173320	Wi-Fi?
11173320	11175520	It would, but my concern is that it's going to have this-
11175520	11176520	Oh, it's going to choke the stream.
11176520	11181880	It's going to choke the stream, which we were having those problems earlier when the feed
11181880	11183360	was unknowingly broadcasting.
11183360	11184360	So yeah.
11184360	11187320	Yeah, we've had a Orange Launch Radio Ustream for like three years.
11187320	11188320	We just don't use it.
11188320	11189320	There you go.
11189320	11190680	And I actually kind of agree with Derek.
11190680	11191680	Justin kind of sucks now.
11191680	11194560	Like the whole... It's just not quite what it used to be.
11194560	11198080	You know, a Ustream has sort of established itself as the definitive place to go for
11198080	11200320	streaming and... I don't know.
11200320	11203280	I don't know if... I really would have to explore.
11203280	11206640	We haven't had videos so long now, ever since we switched studios, that I'd really have
11206640	11207640	to explore that.
11207640	11208640	So we'll see.
11208640	11209640	All right.
11209640	11212400	Anyhow, I didn't mean to get off topic.
11212400	11214120	I was waiting for calls, but none are coming in.
11214120	11216120	What is... How are we going to do a marathon with no calls?
11216120	11217120	We're screwed.
11217120	11218120	Dammit, people.
11218120	11219120	Call.
11219120	11221440	We'll try to get at least one more call in before we say goodbye to Loki.
11221440	11225960	1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, if you want to give us
11225960	11227040	a call.
11227040	11229680	We'll try to squeeze in at least one more call, but if you don't get in now, that's
11229680	11230680	okay.
11230680	11233800	We'll open it up again around the usual time, about eight o'clock later this evening, and
11233800	11236920	so forth, during the OLR marathon.
11236920	11240200	We also have some more stories we're going to do.
11240200	11244720	If I have time to write them while other people are talking, and I'm not so intoxicated after
11244720	11248040	that drink, we will do some OLR games.
11248040	11249200	We need a listless topic.
11249200	11250200	We can think of that later.
11250200	11251200	Totally.
11251200	11252200	And we should do match game?
11252200	11253200	We'll do match game.
11253200	11255760	We have at least four people here, and with Dan we'll have five, so we can do a match
11255760	11256760	game.
11256760	11259680	We could also do Mad Libs.
11259680	11262680	You never did do OLR Mad Libs.
11262680	11266120	The phone is ringing and my back is turned, I can't even see it, shame on me.
11266120	11267120	Let's go to the phones.
11267120	11268120	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.
11268120	11269120	Who's this?
11269120	11270120	This is Haseo.
11270120	11271120	Taseo?
11271120	11272120	Haseo Sumerakawa.
11272120	11273120	Oh, Haseo.
11273120	11274120	Okay, hi, how you doing?
11274120	11275120	I'm doing good.
11275120	11276120	Good.
11276120	11277120	What is on your mind, my friend?
11277120	11289520	I just want to say that role-playing quests are a bitch.
11289520	11290640	Role-playing quests are a bitch?
11290640	11293060	What game are you playing right now?
11293060	11297880	I am playing a free-to-play MMO called Nabinogi.
11297880	11300920	I have never heard of this, so you've got to tell us a little more about this.
11300920	11303840	Is there a website you can download this at or anything like that?
11303840	11308360	Yeah, the Nexon.nabinogi.com.
11308360	11313080	They also do MapleStory and The League Fighter and whatnot.
11313080	11317120	So is this a very MapleStory-esque kind of game or is this like more Warcraft inspired
11317120	11318440	or what's this game kind of like?
11318440	11320440	It's like Warcraft meets anime.
11320440	11321440	Interesting.
11321440	11323440	That could be interesting.
11323440	11324440	And it's free?
11324440	11326440	Is it ad-supported or what's the deal?
11326440	11330320	It's 100% free.
11330320	11338880	You can upgrade to a membership for a month, which gives you a possibility to run a guild,
11338880	11343120	open shops, use a bag, whatnot.
11343120	11344120	Cool.
11344120	11346280	But this game is being a pain in the ass right now?
11346280	11350080	That's why you're saying that role-playing quests are a bitch?
11350080	11358280	Yes, because each expansion is a generation, otherwise known as a G and then the number
11358280	11360440	of the expansion level.
11360440	11367240	And throughout all G1, your character has to role-play as a character named Tarwhak
11367240	11371400	who pretty much only uses a loot as a weapon, otherwise you can fight bare-handed and use
11371400	11372400	magic.
11372400	11373400	Interesting.
11373400	11374960	What turned you on to this game?
11374960	11377800	How'd you find out about it?
11377800	11382800	My friend actually plays it, who I was PVPing against.
11382800	11383800	Very cool.
11383800	11384800	Very cool.
11384800	11389320	Quickly, what other games types of stuff are you into?
11389320	11394920	I played just about anything except for anything that has Hannah Montana or Barbie attached
11394920	11395920	to it.
11395920	11400000	You know the Hannah Montana game on DS is apparently pretty sweet, so I'm just saying.
11400000	11402640	I heard there was a music game on the DS that was actually pretty sweet.
11402640	11403640	Just saying.
11403640	11404640	All right.
11404640	11405640	Hannah needs to burp.
11405640	11411600	All right, any other parting words for our listeners tonight before we let you go?
11411600	11417360	Hm, the Neutron movie will be epic.
11417360	11422100	It better be, because Dark Soccer and I are planning an epic trip that will probably pre-empt
11422100	11427120	the show to go on this stupid trip, so stay tuned.
11427120	11430440	All right, thank you so much for the call, Haseo, and stay tuned.
11430440	11433040	Are you going to listen for a few more hours to the marathon tonight?
11433040	11435880	Yes, I'm listening to the whole thing.
11435880	11436880	The whole thing.
11436880	11437880	Good luck, buddy.
11437880	11438880	All right.
11438880	11439880	Take care, my friend.
11439880	11440880	All right, thanks.
11440880	11443720	1877 Game OLR, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
11443720	11445440	We can fit in one more call.
11445440	11446440	Why not?
11446440	11447440	We got time.
11447440	11448440	We got a lot of time.
11448440	11450440	A lot of time.
11450440	11454240	1877 Game OLR, if you want to give us a call, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
11454240	11457120	Have we figured out the whole dinner thing yet?
11457120	11458120	Are we doing a...
11458120	11460080	We're going to get taken bakes.
11460080	11461080	Awesome.
11461080	11463040	We wanted someone to make the Papa Murphy's run.
11463040	11464040	Okay.
11464040	11467120	When I sober up, I can go, but that's going to take me at least another hour.
11467120	11468120	Okay.
11468120	11469120	But I can't drink anything until then.
11469120	11470120	You want some Triscuits?
11470120	11471120	Okay.
11471120	11472120	That would be lovely.
11472120	11473120	Okay.
11473120	11474120	All right.
11474120	11476600	1877 Game OLR, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
11476600	11478800	Loki's going to be leaving us after we go to the next break.
11478800	11480480	I should really take a nap when I get home.
11480480	11482720	I woke up at four o'clock in the morning this morning.
11482720	11485640	I was going to ask, what is it that you're going to be doing when you go home?
11485640	11486640	Um...
11486640	11487640	Babysitting?
11487640	11492480	I'm going to be watching the baby, probably go to bed at like...
11492480	11495640	You know, I always say I'm going to go to bed early, but it ends up being 11.
11495640	11499820	I'm going to work on my Grand Theft Auto mods if I can, and I have to go grocery shopping
11499820	11502040	because we have nothing in the house.
11502040	11509880	And then what else do I have to do?
11509880	11511360	Maybe bid on something on eBay.
11511360	11512360	Bid on something on eBay.
11512360	11513360	Yeah.
11513360	11514360	All right.
11514360	11515360	Good stuff.
11515360	11516360	All right.
11516360	11517360	I might be...
11517360	11525480	Well, I should be getting a Kinect camera in the next few weeks.
11525480	11526480	Ooh!
11526480	11527760	Well, good luck with that.
11527760	11529380	And this is not one of the beta cameras.
11529380	11534960	This is actually the real retail camera with the retail version of Kinect adventures.
11534960	11539000	If the guy doesn't deliver it, though, then I will give it my back.
11539000	11540000	Something's going on.
11540000	11541920	We might not be broadcasting right now.
11541920	11544840	It looks like our Winamp is frozen.
11544840	11547320	I'm not seeing anything in chat.
11547320	11551240	But let's just keep going for the podcast's sake.
11551240	11554920	I don't know what's going on.
11554920	11556280	If folks can hear us or what have you.
11556280	11557280	But it looks like...
11557280	11558280	I'm keeping up with the chat room.
11558280	11559280	Shit.
11559280	11561760	The last thing I saw was somebody saying parting words for Loki.
11561760	11563320	Did you see anything after that?
11563320	11564320	That's all I saw.
11564320	11565960	I typed while we were broadcasting.
11565960	11567600	I didn't see that.
11567600	11568600	Something's wrong.
11568600	11569600	So they're not hearing us right now.
11569600	11571240	I'm going to start and stop our feed.
11571240	11572240	Yeah.
11572240	11574160	It says my nickname's in use already.
11574160	11575160	Shit.
11575160	11576160	I'm disconnected.
11576160	11577160	Okay.
11577160	11578160	That's not good.
11578160	11579160	So we're going to...
11579160	11580160	Oh, now I'm back.
11580160	11582480	We're going to reconnect right now.
11582480	11584880	How many times is this going to happen tonight?
11584880	11587220	Oh, shit.
11587220	11589240	And I reconnected using the wrong encoder.
11589240	11590600	That's real good, Rob.
11590600	11593240	Real good.
11593240	11598960	Live radio, the joys, the perils, the heartache, the trials, the tribulations.
11598960	11599960	Okay.
11599960	11600960	We're back up.
11600960	11601960	We're live.
11601960	11603440	So slowly folks are going to be coming back on.
11603440	11607060	That might explain why the Skype line hasn't been ringing if our internet just suddenly
11607060	11608600	decided to crap out.
11608600	11609600	All right.
11609600	11611520	It looks like I'm reconnecting slowly but surely.
11611520	11612520	Oh, no.
11612520	11613520	It died again.
11613520	11614520	I've been on AIM the entire time.
11614520	11615520	It just died again.
11615520	11616520	It died again?
11616520	11620440	I've been on AIM the entire time and had no problem.
11620440	11626600	It shows that we are connected on Shoutcast.
11626600	11628600	This is bad stuff.
11628600	11631320	Says auto-excessive connections from a single host.
11631320	11632320	Oh, fuck.
11632320	11635640	G line from Game Surge.
11635640	11639440	So we got booted from chat altogether because there's too many of us trying to connect because
11639440	11642280	our ghosts were still lurking there.
11642280	11643280	That's great.
11643280	11645980	So we might've just lost the chat room for the rest of the evening.
11645980	11647080	That is wonderful.
11647080	11651200	Those G lines reset after like 10, 15 minutes.
11651200	11652200	It really depends.
11652200	11653200	Yeah.
11653200	11654200	Do they?
11654200	11655200	Yeah.
11655200	11656200	All right.
11656200	11657200	Have some driscuits, Rob.
11657200	11658200	Great.
11658200	11659200	So now we have to marathon with no chat room.
11659200	11660200	This ought to be lovely.
11660200	11661200	For now.
11661200	11662200	Well.
11662200	11663200	Well, that sucks.
11663200	11664200	Got to go now.
11664200	11665200	All right.
11665200	11666200	This is great.
11666200	11675600	If I probably load the Twitter, there's going to be a million people tweeting going.
11675600	11679280	Try it through the web browser because that uses like a proxy thing.
11679280	11680280	Oh, does it?
11680280	11681280	I'll do that.
11681280	11683680	I need someone to help me fill time here real quick.
11683680	11684680	Something so.
11684680	11685680	I'm sorry.
11685680	11686680	We're all here chewing on triscuits.
11686680	11687680	Yep.
11687680	11688680	That's the marathon.
11688680	11698640	It's just going to be like eight hours of this chewing on triscuits and Rob hunting
11698640	11699640	down a way to get in.
11699640	11700640	I need to get our chat.
11700640	11701640	The chat's like, Oh God.
11701640	11702640	It wants me to install Java.
11702640	11706560	Let me try to reconnect here real quick on the old fashioned way.
11706560	11710180	See if that works.
11710180	11711180	We need chat.
11711180	11712760	Our Skype line is supposedly open.
11712760	11715920	So if somebody can hear us, somebody call us shit.
11715920	11724200	Yeah, no, it's showing that we're G line still because I guess too many of us run at once.
11724200	11725200	We're up though.
11725200	11732440	According to try the chat app and IE maybe if it's on that machine.
11732440	11735800	Because Java may be separate for Firefox if that's what you're using.
11735800	11741600	Um, let me, Oh, I will do that.
11741600	11745400	Our Skype line is still open one eight seven seven game OLR or our username on Skype is
11745400	11748960	orange lounge radio.
11748960	11751040	Your mic is also dying a lot.
11751040	11752040	I'm in web chat.
11752040	11753040	Trying to get there.
11753040	11754040	Anyway.
11754040	11755040	Are you?
11755040	11757200	It still says G line for web chat.
11757200	11759840	So Oh, Oh, we're getting at least a call.
11759840	11760840	Hi.
11760840	11761840	We're on orange.
11761840	11762840	Who's this?
11762840	11763840	It's Rodney again.
11763840	11766640	Just calling your support team staff because that's pretty much what I am.
11766640	11767640	You again.
11767640	11768640	All right.
11768640	11769760	Well, uh, we're, we're up, right?
11769760	11771120	You guys can hear us again?
11771120	11772120	Yeah.
11772120	11773120	We can hear you fine.
11773120	11776280	It's just that the whole G line thing, cause that popped up those, that happens when it's
11776280	11781780	like more than three or four people from the same IP that logs into the chat, which is
11781780	11784760	custom that dark soccer, myself and Loki will all log in.
11784760	11788920	But unfortunately when we tried to log back in after we got booted from our internet,
11788920	11789920	we all got G lines.
11789920	11792360	So yeah, we don't have a chat right now.
11792360	11795800	I just sent you guys a tweet, how to, how to circumvent the whole thing.
11795800	11801520	Um, I think don't, don't we just have to wait like 15 minutes and we'll be fine.
11801520	11803760	I don't know how long you have to wait.
11803760	11807720	I'm just saying if you go to mibbit.com, it'll, you can log in that way.
11807720	11808720	All right.
11808720	11809720	Maybe we'll look at that.
11809720	11810720	All right.
11810720	11811720	We'll look into that.
11811720	11812720	Dark soccer's looking at that.
11812720	11813720	I tried.
11813720	11814720	It didn't work.
11814720	11815720	All right.
11815720	11816720	Let me take a call.
11816720	11817720	I'm gonna take a call from another number.
11817720	11818720	Okay.
11818720	11819720	All right.
11819720	11820720	Let me take a call from Eric.
11820720	11821720	Hello.
11821720	11822720	This is Eric Hatcher, AKA Tri-Team.
11822720	11825720	I've been a long time listener, but I work mostly.
11825720	11828200	Oh, well, Hey, what's on your mind, buddy?
11828200	11830940	We're having, this is a heck of a night to call in and we're just having technical difficulties
11830940	11831940	left and right.
11831940	11832940	We can't see our audience right now.
11832940	11837520	Well, that's probably the reason I called, I guess I'm, uh, if I sound out of breath,
11837520	11841720	it's cause I'm on the walking track and I'm using you guys to pass the time while I work
11841720	11845720	off the weight on my long ass game butt.
11845720	11846720	Wow.
11846720	11849000	What, what, what types of games do you, uh, what types of games are you into?
11849000	11850000	What types of games do you play?
11850000	11851000	Oh, just a little bit of everything.
11851000	11858040	Um, pretty much all the modern systems, I'd say, uh, I'm mostly the Xbox 360 and, uh,
11858040	11863720	of course I get my NMO RPG, uh, still on EverQuest still.
11863720	11865960	Still EverQuest after all these years?
11865960	11866960	Why EverQuest?
11866960	11872680	Well, I guess just cause of the people I know there, I've been, uh, on the same, well, other
11872680	11877000	than the server mergers, I've been on the same server for 11 years now.
11877000	11879720	And it's, it's probably the people that keep you coming back, huh?
11879720	11880720	Really?
11880720	11882040	That is exactly what it is.
11882040	11885520	Yeah, I can see that cause, uh, that's part of the, pretty much a lot of the reason why
11885520	11886520	I keep playing Wow.
11886520	11890060	Like, I know a lot of people are like, oh, you're an addict, you play Wow all the time
11890060	11891060	and so forth.
11891060	11894440	I'm like, well, it's really the social element, the game I can kind of give or take, but it's
11894440	11898800	really the, excuse me, the social element that keeps me coming back.
11898800	11904840	I agree 100%, that's exactly why I've kept playing for so long.
11904840	11905840	So very cool.
11905840	11910000	Well, um, let's see, any new stories that you want to comment on that we talked about
11910000	11911000	tonight?
11911000	11912800	Uh, I don't know.
11912800	11919240	I haven't, uh, I just talked, uh, oh, the last about 20 or 30 minutes or so, something
11919240	11923640	I guess I'd like to talk about is, uh, I don't know if y'all are familiar, there's a game
11923640	11927800	that came out within the last couple of weeks, uh, last week or so called elemental, the
11927800	11931720	war of magic on the PC, it paddles a lot of trouble.
11931720	11932960	I think I've heard of it.
11932960	11936200	Uh, yeah, I don't think I've played, I know I haven't played it, but I think I've heard
11936200	11937200	of this.
11937200	11938200	Tell us a little bit more about this game.
11938200	11944160	Well, it's, uh, by, uh, the company StarDuck and, uh, StarDock and, uh, Brad Wardall is,
11944160	11947160	uh, probably the lead designer on that, I believe.
11947160	11953640	Pretty, uh, nice guy, but this is the worst, uh, um, most, ws piece of software I've played
11953640	11962200	in the last 20 years, I guess, of playing, uh, computer games.
11962200	11964200	Hmm.
11964200	11968120	Which is very unfortunate, the game has a lot of potential, if any of you are familiar
11968120	11974480	with, uh, Masters of Magic, it's sort of a civilization-like game with a fantasy bent.
11974480	11977600	Ooh, those are like all of my favorite games you just said.
11977600	11984600	Exactly, and, uh, it has so much potential, but it just didn't work out, unfortunately.
11984600	11986320	That's too bad.
11986320	11990680	I hate it when you got a game that sounds like such a good idea, like on paper, but
11990680	11992560	then in execution it sucks.
11992560	11993560	Ah, exactly.
11993560	11994560	Yeah.
11994560	12001120	Uh, anyway, I just mostly called to help you out with a little bit of time, I don't really
12001120	12002480	have a whole lot to say.
12002480	12003480	That's alright, we like hearing from you.
12003480	12004480	Wait, where'd you say you're calling from?
12004480	12005480	Uh, big pardon?
12005480	12008480	Where'd you say you're calling from?
12008480	12011880	Oh, uh, basically Birmingham, Alabama.
12011880	12012880	Really?
12012880	12013880	From my home state then?
12013880	12014880	Oh, exactly.
12014880	12021480	Now, I've, I've, uh, spent many, many a time up in Birmingham, and, uh, although I spent
12021480	12028440	more time around Dothan and Montgomery, so, but yeah, Mobile's my hometown.
12028440	12030440	So nice to talk to someone from my home state.
12030440	12031440	Welcome.
12031440	12032440	Woo!
12032440	12037960	Nice talking to y'all, and I look forward to seeing you more as they continue to progress.
12037960	12038960	Alright, sounds good.
12038960	12039960	You have a good one, buddy.
12039960	12040960	Take care.
12040960	12041960	Thanks for tuning in.
12041960	12042960	Take care.
12042960	12043960	Bye bye.
12043960	12044960	Bye bye.
12044960	12045960	Alright.
12045960	12048640	I can almost always pick out an Alabama accent.
12048640	12049640	Yeah?
12049640	12051880	So I was like, bing!
12051880	12052880	Radar.
12052880	12053880	Nice.
12053880	12055080	Alright, well, we're gonna go ahead and go to a break.
12055080	12060680	I am actually, I just downloaded an IRC chat client to my phone to try and connect.
12060680	12061920	Oh, there we go.
12061920	12064240	I got it.
12064240	12066560	And they're saying, wait, did Loki, yeah, I can see chat.
12066560	12069480	So I have chat open on my phone right now.
12069480	12072820	So I finally have a lifeblood into the chat room, so, uh, there you go.
12072820	12076360	So chatters, I can now see you again.
12076360	12079240	Don't send me private messages if you figure out what my name is on there.
12079240	12080360	It's not too hard to figure out.
12080360	12081360	Don't send me private messages.
12081360	12083840	Oh, we had another call coming in.
12083840	12085520	This will be our last call before we take another break.
12085520	12086520	Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.
12086520	12087520	Who's this?
12087520	12088520	This is Toa Gak.
12088520	12089520	Hey, Toa Gak.
12089520	12090520	How are you, buddy?
12090520	12091520	What's on your mind?
12091520	12098400	Um, I just called in because I'm going to give you the URL you'd need to go to to get
12098400	12099600	the G line removed.
12099600	12101880	Okay, what is that?
12101880	12109640	It's gamesurge.net slash utils slash G line.
12109640	12113560	All right, I'm looking at that right now.
12113560	12117920	Oh, one G line found for your host resolved in an hour.
12117920	12127400	Okay, so I'm on that page and it says why we're banned, okay.
12127400	12131200	It will only last one hour, so there you go.
12131200	12133160	We just have to wait out the hour then.
12133160	12134160	Jerks.
12134160	12135160	That's okay.
12135160	12138280	So we got till 6 25 and no chat, but that's okay because I got chat on my phone.
12138280	12139280	I figured it out.
12139280	12140280	I worked around.
12140280	12141280	All right.
12141280	12142280	Hi.
12142280	12143280	Just a, um, listener.
12143280	12157980	Just a reminder, it's probably a bad idea to circumvent it, the G line, because they
12157980	12158980	can tell.
12158980	12160840	Well, no, I'm on my iPhone.
12160840	12161840	It's three G.
12161840	12162840	It's okay.
12162840	12163840	We'll be okay.
12163840	12164840	We're not on Comcast.
12164840	12165840	It shows us three G.
12165840	12166840	Well, it'll be our little secret.
12166840	12167840	Okay.
12167840	12168840	All right.
12168840	12169840	All right.
12169840	12171880	Well, thanks for the tip.
12171880	12172880	We appreciate it.
12172880	12175520	At least we know it's only for an hour, so we know we'll be able to get back in.
12175520	12177520	All right.
12177520	12179520	Have a good one, buddy.
12179520	12180520	Okay.
12180520	12181520	Bye.
12181520	12182520	Thanks for the tip.
12182520	12183520	All right.
12183520	12186160	We're gonna on that note, I think we need a break after that.
12186160	12187160	Oh boy.
12187160	12188160	All right.
12188160	12189480	Uh, people are saying hi.
12189480	12190480	Why were you banned?
12190480	12193320	Well, they don't like more than three people on the same IP.
12193320	12194320	Dranami's got it there.
12194320	12199520	And they're saying, actually, it's five, says Toa Gak, but, uh, I don't...
12199520	12200520	The various...
12200520	12204400	It says three, um, on the page that explains why you're G aligned.
12204400	12205400	It's weird.
12205400	12209260	When various clients try to reconnect and disconnect due to internet issues within a
12209260	12213080	certain amount of time, the server has no way of knowing what's going on and it kind
12213080	12214080	of thinks it's a DDoS.
12214080	12216200	It's a denial of service, I get it.
12216200	12218360	So it's, it's just a fail safe.
12218360	12220760	I'll forgive them someday.
12220760	12222480	I'll find it in my heart to forgive them.
12222480	12223480	All right.
12223480	12227040	We're going to, um, actually say goodbye to Loki at this point before we go to another
12227040	12228040	break.
12228040	12229920	And, uh, Loki, any final words for our listeners tonight?
12229920	12231800	No, I just have to go get groceries.
12231800	12232800	That's always fun.
12232800	12234320	I guess I don't like chores.
12234320	12235320	All right.
12235320	12236320	Well, good luck with all that.
12236320	12240680	Uh, this is actually the part of the show where we would be saying basically, uh, goodnight
12240680	12241680	for listening.
12241680	12244640	This is kind of the end of the normal part of the show, if you will.
12244640	12246200	We're going to be getting into the more random stuff.
12246200	12249980	So if you're just looking for your normal quote unquote edition of orange launch radio,
12249980	12253200	this is kind of the end of that part, but we will be back in just a little bit with
12253200	12254200	more of orange launch radio.
12254200	12258480	Now, just so you know, for the podcast feed, we're going to be releasing the marathon in
12258480	12259680	bits this week.
12259680	12262400	So you may not see everything up right away.
12262400	12267160	So you know, just give it a little extra time if the, you know, show, you know, if you're
12267160	12271560	done listening to this part of the podcast and you want more, just give it a little more
12271560	12272560	time.
12272560	12273560	That's all we need.
12273560	12279760	Yeah, real quick, I was going to say we're having our game summit, my work game summit
12279760	12280760	thing.
12280760	12284520	You know, we do it usually each year and, uh, we have the game publishers coming out
12284520	12285800	and talking about stuff.
12285800	12290840	So maybe I'll learn some new information and we can share it appropriate time if you know
12290840	12291840	what I mean.
12291840	12292840	All right.
12292840	12293840	And that'll be something to look forward to next week.
12293840	12294840	Yes, possibly.
12294840	12297600	And also hopefully I'll have a new, uh, I've iPod by then.
12297600	12298600	All right.
12298600	12304240	Well, um, I don't know, should I play the closing song that we usually play at the end
12304240	12305240	here?
12305240	12306240	Play our little closing song.
12306240	12307240	Sure.
12307240	12308240	Cause we got to put it on the podcast anyways.
12308240	12309240	Don't you?
12309240	12310240	I guess that's true.
12310240	12311240	So let me see.
12311240	12313400	I now I have to cue that up that that involves work.
12313400	12314400	So good night everybody.
12314400	12315400	Thanks for listening.
12315400	12316400	We'll be back though.
12316400	12319200	If you are listening live or on podcasts or whatever, we still got the marathon coming
12319200	12321560	up and plenty more show.
12321560	12325300	Um, who knows what randomness is going to happen when we don't have a chat room going
12325300	12326300	on here.
12326300	12331240	The folks in chat are saying good night and they're waving even though you can't see them
12331240	12335920	and I'm getting everything up from, uh, let's see.
12335920	12339680	Toa gax says, if my IRC was server was up, I would let them bounce IRC off of me.
12339680	12340680	Oh, that's a good idea.
12340680	12344800	Somebody should put up like a fake fake server that we can go on and at least see our chat
12344800	12345800	room still.
12345800	12346800	Yeah.
12346800	12349160	My roommate has a, um, Linux box running in the spare bedroom.
12349160	12350160	Oh really?
12350160	12352200	So I could shell into that and we can see from there.
12352200	12355600	That might be a good idea, but I'm not going to worry about it too much.
12355600	12356600	It's just an hour, right?
12356600	12358160	We can make it an hour.
12358160	12359160	We can do it.
12359160	12363360	All right, we're going to play our outro, say good night and we'll be back though with
12363360	12366000	more of the OLR marathon right after this.
