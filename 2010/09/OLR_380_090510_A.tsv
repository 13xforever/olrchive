14182	18888	Today, September 5th, 2010, the 360 is set to get a new controller.
19268	25016	News from PAX includes the return of a long-forgotten game franchise, and could comic books be coming to the PS3?
32287	37573	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
37653	40777	We are that show where every gamer has a voice.
40857	48545	And joining you over the next several, many, long hours, my name is Rob Roberts, sometimes going by Sky in our chatroom and so forth.
49086	52530	Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
52930	53391	Hi.
53531	54011	How are you?
54832	56333	I'm on podcast number two for the day.
56553	57254	I know, yes.
57934	60757	You're having quite the podcasting day, but we'll get to that in a minute.
60837	61357	Yeah.
61417	63920	But we also have to introduce the one and only Techmaster Loki.
65543	65903	Hello.
66084	66564	How are you?
67325	67765	I'm good.
67805	69367	I made an observation this morning.
69387	70047	I was trying to confirm.
70067	70948	What is that?
72049	75632	I don't know if anybody remembers the guy, Reginald Vel Johnson.
76273	77014	You may remember him.
77034	78275	Was he the dad on Family Matters?
78295	80217	He was the dad on Family Matters.
80337	80437	Oh!
80457	82479	Dude, I'm a pop culture sponge.
82999	89125	Anyways, I was watching Ghostbusters today because they were playing it on Comedy Central, and he was a cop in that.
89145	89345	I'm like...
89525	93329	How many fucking movies and shows has he been a damn police officer in?
93569	96291	Because he's always a goddamn police officer in everything.
97202	98203	Quite a few, actually.
98823	102727	Die Hard 1, Die Hard 2, and Ghostbusters, as well as Family Matters.
103247	107771	And, of course, I'd have to go through the rest of these to figure out, you know, which ones of these.
107811	110473	He's actually a police officer, but it just has his name on there.
110914	113035	But it's just weird.
113356	113776	I know.
113816	114797	What has he done lately?
114997	117279	Can we get him on the show, maybe, to do some voiceovers?
118360	120462	He was also in Die Hard Vendetta, the video game.
120762	123624	Oh, bringing it back to games.
123664	123945	Love it.
123985	124265	All right.
124565	127046	Over the next many hours, we are going to be talking about video games.
141434	144355	We're actually having an early start, so we are live at All Games Radio.
144395	150578	We do tape live every Sunday at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show, usually.
150938	154999	But today it's 2 o'clock Pacific, 5 o'clock Eastern, and we're starting to show a little bit early.
155379	156840	It's 10 o'clock in England.
156980	158320	Yeah, 10 at night.
158401	162542	So finally we're getting kind of an earlier show in for them, so I hope some folks overseas are listening too.
163502	167064	But we're going to actually try to go late tonight.
167184	168144	I don't know how late.
168324	170105	The goal is midnight tonight.
170595	171576	We might go longer.
172036	173257	We might go not as long.
173718	174438	I don't know.
174859	175479	But we'll see.
175579	176980	So we're doing the marathon episode.
177081	177421	Why?
178081	178762	Because we can.
179923	180363	Why not?
180804	182865	It's not a fundraiser for anything.
182925	184867	I mean, you should donate to charities.
185308	186048	Do good in your life.
186749	191192	But we're just doing this for fun because everybody else is at some freaking convention this weekend.
191233	193895	So we're having a little mini festival of our own.
194395	196717	We do have some guests joining us in studio here today.
197498	198899	I don't know how long they'll be with us.
199259	200640	I think he'll be with us the whole time.
200700	203562	Say hello to Salacious Pop or Alan.
203702	204063	Hello.
204283	204683	How are you?
205203	206324	Much better than last time.
206705	206965	Really?
207025	207745	What was wrong last time?
207846	209267	I had food poisoning when I was on the show.
209447	210267	Oh, that's right.
210287	212389	You were recovering from the Reno trip.
212609	212789	Yes.
212809	213890	But you're feeling much better today.
213930	214150	Yes.
214491	214711	All right.
215091	217832	Yeah, I was a little worried about that because we're doing this marathon today.
217852	219373	We didn't really plan it out very well.
219973	222454	It's just like, hey, let's broadcast for 12 hours.
222654	223454	Okay.
223574	225395	Oh, when are we going to eat?
226636	227356	So I don't know.
227396	230537	Hopefully Dan is going to be back at some point where we'll be able to kind of rotate in and out.
230998	234719	So learn with us here at Orange Lounge Radio tonight.
234739	235739	Just order a pizza.
235799	237220	Just put the pizza guy on the show.
237760	238521	Talk about games.
238741	241182	And he's like, I'm going to get fired.
241242	241482	Yeah.
242783	243263	You know what?
243323	246566	If it wasn't that Dan couldn't have the sodium, we could totally just do a take and bake.
247506	248907	Send Dan off to be our errand boy.
248927	249408	Yeah.
250068	250449	Good times.
250469	251189	Go to Papa Murphy's.
251509	251890	Good times.
252330	255513	Also joining us, say hello to Bradley, our KDN42.
255933	257534	You said there'd be surprises.
257614	258275	I'm the first one.
258315	258515	Woohoo!
259496	259916	How are you?
260777	265181	You were on the show a couple months ago, but before that you weren't on for a couple years.
265201	266562	I was on a few months ago, I don't remember.
266582	267163	I thought you were.
267323	271847	I think the last time I was on was at your house.
272587	273468	Oh, that was a while ago.
273668	274269	I thought for some reason.
274429	274669	Oh, well.
275190	275410	Whatever.
275430	278594	I think you maybe mentioned me because I was here for her party or something before that.
278615	279536	Nah, that might have been it.
279556	280136	That might have been it.
280176	282760	And then I just popped in the chat room like once or twice.
282920	283381	There you go.
283461	284802	Well, what's new with Bradley?
284822	285343	What are you up to?
285623	289348	Well, I haven't been playing any games this last week because I was on the road.
289368	292272	I did like a seven-day trip of National Parks.
292372	292913	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
310089	313432	Then the next one was Theodore Roosevelt, which I just kind of drove around.
314773	320939	And also the next day was Rocky Mountain, where you go up like 12,000 feet when you're driving.
321119	323582	Then Arches, which has all the natural arches in it.
324342	325904	And Canyonlands, which is a big canyon.
327686	330388	Also was, what's the next one after that?
330448	333631	Was Coral Reef, or Capital Reef.
334522	336403	Bradley, I'm thinking you should just be a park ranger.
336744	339005	Like, can't you see Bradley as a park ranger?
339085	340206	Like, I could totally see that.
340266	344128	He'd just be in his cabin during the winters with the Xbox and what have you.
344889	349352	Actually, let me give a little background on Orange Lingerie.
349572	357517	Since we have a lot of extra time today, I can kind of do that for the people who haven't listened in a very, or just now listening, or you haven't heard this story because you haven't told it in a long time.
358238	359979	Here's what Orange Lingerie is all about.
360259	360940	DarkSakura, Loki,
378396	379296	Thanks for watching!
395362	399925	DDR is still around, but the culture isn't quite the same as it used to be back in my day.
400246	405369	But we decided to start a show about DDR and Dance Dance Revolution and that whole scene.
405389	408812	And that's the way the show was for about the first, what, about three, four years we were doing that?
409272	412034	Then when podcasting came around, we got into doing that.
412094	413455	We used to do a spinoff show.
413475	417678	It was a spinoff show of our main show about just video games in general.
418178	424723	And then that kind of took off and ended up kind of taking over the DDR part when music games and so forth...
425143	426545	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
445703	446384	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
472862	475206	and all the ways you guys can interact with us and give us your opinion.
483035	484855	It's because we're technologically able.
484995	486036	We have the technology.
486096	487616	We can repair something.
488056	488656	Something, something.
489036	489316	All right.
490236	493557	So anyway, the reason why I give that background is that we all kind of bring different things to the table.
493637	495617	We all like different types of games.
496738	509720	For instance, DarkSakura, she does the classic game of the week here on the show every week because she has a vast brain full of useless video game trivia and these obscure-ass import games even I don't hear of ever, so...
511120	512821	That's kind of her background, right?
512861	514421	Is that kind of a fair assessment?
515221	515882	Yeah.
516562	525304	And then Loki, speaking of random trivia, he has been in nine different shows or series playing a law enforcement officer.
525604	530686	Granted, the one in Ghostbusters, he was a prison guard, but goddammit, that's close enough.
530866	533847	So, nine different series or movies.
533867	536908	Don't you have to be an officer to be a prison guard?
538429	539831	It's still a law enforcement job.
540652	541413	But yeah, that's a lot.
541473	542854	He's just really typecast.
543075	544456	Anyways, enough talking about him.
544476	545618	I'm not going to talk about him anymore.
545758	546058	Promise?
546359	546619	Promise.
546659	548181	You're going to have a good 12 hours to do so.
548221	549242	I know you're not staying the whole time.
549522	554689	Anyway, Loki is kind of... I see him as more of our tech, hack, crack...
555169	557611	If there's a way to break the game, he will, kind of guy.
557991	562475	He was the guy that probably bought a Game Genie as soon as they were out to see how he could screw up the game.
563276	563916	I bought one, though.
564497	566738	Would that be kind of a fair assessment of what you're all about?
567159	567539	I'm sure.
567999	568280	All right.
568340	569260	And then me, I don't know.
569721	572563	I grew up on Commodore 64 and all the old school games.
572603	575946	So I like to think of myself as kind of like a retro-y gamer as well.
575966	576987	But I like a lot of new stuff, too.
577027	578368	I think lately it's been MMOs.
578668	579529	I've played a lot of them.
580109	581971	and a lot of like computer games too.
582151	584333	I mean, not all of them, but I try to do them.
584413	586334	So I'm just kind of a little bit of everything.
586815	593961	And then the reason why I kind of lay all that out is I want to ask Bradley, what types of games do you bring?
594001	595262	What's your gaming background?
595302	597804	What are your likes and dislikes in gaming?
598284	599424	Thanks for watching!
619309	621511	Cool deal, cool deal.
621891	629276	I always think it's a bad idea when people go around saying, I hate all sports games, or I hate sports video games.
629316	630837	Sports video games are crap.
631417	639223	A lot of people on this show, it may not be the preference of the types of games we play most of the time, but I think it would be a lie to say I hate all sports games, because I
639443	642125	I love NBA Jam, and I love that it's coming back.
643245	645887	I have a way to make it very nice and simple for you.
645967	658654	It's just like racing games, how you have your arcade racing games, which are fun to play, and your simulation racing games, which require you to be able to drive and tune a car with the same precision that you would a real car.
659735	661876	You hate simulation sports games.
661956	664618	You do like arcade-style sports games, though.
665338	666539	That actually makes a lot of sense.
666719	672901	And then over there, those folks, usually it's like, oh, well, I hate all those Japanese RPGs.
673341	675222	There's too much of the same stuff.
675662	677183	But maybe I'll play Final Fantasy.
678343	682065	I'll play that one that is kind of out in the mainstream.
682245	683765	Or music games.
683805	686086	A lot of people are like, that arrow stomping?
686286	686766	No, what is that?
686806	688827	That Japanese rave-y techno music?
688887	689287	What is that?
689367	689767	What is that?
690248	693449	And I sort of see that as the hardcore music games, like Beatmania 2DX.
693809	695170	is a hardcore music game.
695710	701334	But I'm sure everybody has enjoyed Guitar Hero at least once, a rock band at a party, drunk, right?
701714	702815	So, you know, it's kind of interesting.
703075	704055	This ties into an email.
704075	705396	I don't recommend DDR drunk.
705896	707137	Well, it can be fun.
707778	708618	Until you hit your head.
708698	709198	Responsibly.
710019	718304	We had an email on the show last week that kind of got me thinking about all this, was the whole, like, my friend says I'm not a gamer because I don't play X, Y, and Z. Remember that?
718444	719585	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
739699	743521	It was kind of not because it's been a busy week for me.
744142	752167	I had school and I had my visit to the mikveh on Thursday.
752807	753888	My conversion went through.
754148	757030	I am now the official Jew of Orange Lounge Radio.
757574	758054	Congrats!
759075	763519	Although SSJ100Matt is probably very upset about his title being stripped and his tiara.
765781	766682	I'm the host.
768063	771346	Okay, you guys can also be the official co-Jews.
771786	774689	Yes, they can be your... It says Yarmulke being stripped.
775910	777111	They can be your harem of Jews.
777391	778832	They can be my posse.
779012	779633	Alright, your posse.
781170	784672	Um, any, anyway, uh, my, my Chavra, that's it.
785392	789914	Anyway, um, so yeah, that happened, and it was really great, and then I had to go talk in front of people on Friday.
791174	807141	Um, but I, I played some Star Trek Online, and I had to go because Dan came home, and it was, I don't know, I just, I, I played a little bit, not a lot, just some, and so, oh, oh, oh, oh, my anniversary was on, um,
809119	811105	Wednesday, my fifth anniversary.
811165	812790	So Dan got me this instead of a rose.
813873	814876	Sims 3 Ambitions.
815077	816340	And isn't that much better than a rose?
816673	821537	Yeah, he also wrote me a note that said, in fact, here it is.
821678	823139	I'll put it up on the thing.
823179	824080	It's on my Facebook right now.
824500	825881	Sorry I didn't get you a rose.
825901	827263	I thought you would like this more.
827423	827903	I love you.
828143	829785	D. Aww.
830025	831466	I'll take a picture and put it on the thing.
831486	832007	That's sweet.
832547	834849	You should gush about him while he's not here to defend himself.
834869	836171	It's really cute.
836191	838373	He has to be a manly man when he's here on the show.
838633	840795	I wish Dan would stop believing his underwear in the hall.
844525	846867	Okay, let's move on to Loki.
846947	848208	How was your gaming week?
849670	852292	My gaming week was pretty slim.
853413	856495	I played more Grand Theft Auto, Lost and Damned.
856976	858397	It's still fun.
859498	862020	And I played a few other things.
863757	865097	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
892805	917149	so there's a few games on there that haven't really been leaked out for JTAG users and that kind of stuff so I got to play a few different Xbox Live Arcade games that aren't out yet um that are actually kind of cool so one of them that I played was um Bonk apparently they're remaking Bonk um from Bonk's Adventure the old TurboGrafx game and um
917469	919011	It's okay.
919552	924900	It's kind of done along the lines of how they did the Hudson Adventure Island remake.
927994	934997	It's okay, but the one thing that they kind of took out of it that really made Bonk Bonk is his giant head.
935558	940080	His head is now a little bit more proportioned to his body, which really sucks.
940500	946183	Because it has the same type of, like when you're climbing a wall before in Bonk's Adventure, he used to use his teeth.
946543	952906	Well, in this, he's still biting the wall, but he also looks like he's climbing, so it doesn't make any sense why he's biting the wall.
953146	955408	I don't remember a New Adventure Island game.
955728	956889	Was that on the Wii or something?
956929	957650	It was on the Wii.
958070	959191	Huh.
959271	960372	I think it was a WiiWare game.
960733	961013	Nice.
961733	963195	But it wasn't very good.
963495	963855	Oh, okay.
963995	964476	That's too bad.
964496	968439	And this one's kind of just okay, but I don't know.
968919	971362	It looks like it might be pretty fun.
971402	973463	I didn't play a whole lot of it, just a few levels, but...
974404	974904	It's alright.
975425	978106	I really wish they'd left this head.
978546	980447	They don't really have to change too much.
981087	985409	Just clean up the sprites a little bit and go from there.
986570	992413	The last Adventure Island game I remember playing that I just absolutely loved was Super Adventure Island on the Super Nintendo.
992473	993993	I don't know if you guys ever played this game.
995054	999416	I think one of the reasons I really loved that game was the soundtrack to that game was amazing.
999956	1000297	Actraiser
1014417	1015217	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1031725	1035147	The version that they have on PartnerNet is broken.
1035648	1045094	It doesn't go past the main menu because you can move the cursor around on the menu, but no button that you press will actually allow you to start the game, which kind of sucked because I wanted to play that.
1045434	1047375	And then what else did I play?
1047395	1048576	There was one other game I played.
1050677	1054460	It was a dancing game that's coming out.
1055120	1059383	Actually, yeah, Dance It's Your Stage, which we'll be talking about coming out next week.
1061364	1084274	um, it's terrible, it's really, really bad, and I don't know, I'm not too familiar with the game itself, but I think, based off the music that I saw in there, and that guy looks like a total douche, um, I believe it's, um, it says it's a port of a German Wii game, I think it's based off of a
1084634	1087635	Yeah, it's based off of a TV show.
1089156	1091097	That's so strange that they're bringing it here then.
1091197	1094498	Does it have David Hasselhoff in it then that you can dance to?
1095579	1100421	No, but the music though in it is just not good.
1100461	1102022	That's really the only thing that kind of sucks.
1102462	1106584	The gameplay itself isn't very good either because it's got two kind of...
1107784	1109045	Thanks for watching!
1125509	1148354	and it gets really confusing when it's you know going really fast and then also the music's very very very very terrible so um I really don't recommend picking it up not that many people probably would have next week anyways but it is a terrible game very very very terrible game um is it bad?
1149034	1154055	it's very bad I wasn't sure it's terabad it's terabad terabad um
1155563	1157224	What else did I play?
1158205	1159025	Oh yeah, one other.
1159245	1163228	I played a cave shooter game, and I'm going to butcher the name.
1163628	1167250	I believe it was called Grungy or something like that.
1168231	1168591	I don't know.
1169011	1170052	It's just from memory there.
1170612	1173114	Anyways, it's your typical cave shooter games.
1173434	1173994	I guess it...
1176636	1176796	Awesome.
1176816	1177056	That was fun.
1198590	1199911	Alright, that it for Game of the Week?
1199931	1200352	That is it.
1200732	1206697	I'm going to be looking forward to your sneak peeks every week now of new stuff coming out until you get shut down.
1206717	1212663	Yeah, until the console gets banned off partner net.
1213884	1224073	Usually when they would ban the consoles, it's actually worse than if you got banned off live because when they ban your console, they blow all the e-fuses and it makes your console very...
1225774	1226255	Broken.
1226595	1227075	Wow.
1227396	1228216	That's kind of evil.
1228336	1234803	But the person that sold me the console took out the resistor that allows those e-fuses to be blown.
1234883	1240348	So if they ban me from PartnerNet, the console will be just fine.
1241068	1244011	That's like Mission Impossible, where it's like, this message will self-destruct in 30 seconds.
1244031	1245052	Yeah, but here's the thing.
1245192	1245312	It's...
1246814	1254842	If I got banned from PartnerNet, I probably wouldn't care because here I thought there was going to be actual beta tests of games and stuff like that.
1255022	1255843	That's not the case.
1255883	1262170	And I could definitely see why they don't do that because people would be leaking that crap left and right.
1262390	1268036	And even still with some of the arcade games, people leak them out there and that's got to suck for them.
1268116	1268256	But
1269648	1271249	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1297806	1312477	We'll start off tonight the marathon with a comment from Spazinator who is talking about the soundtracks because I was talking about Yuzo Koshiro a little bit ago says in my opinion the OSTs for Killer Instinct, Actraiser, Super Castlevania 4 and Mr. Bones have the best music.
1312937	1315839	Those are all some really good soundtracks although I don't know Mr. Bones.
1315899	1316640	What system was that on?
1316940	1317461	I don't know.
1333337	1333677	Cool, cool.
1334057	1339580	The Killer Cuts CD that you got when you pre-ordered Killer Instinct on SNES was amazing.
1339840	1340400	Yes, it was.
1340580	1342421	Hours and hours played in high school.
1342501	1344202	It wasn't necessarily a pre-order either.
1344362	1348644	I just went into Montgomery Wars back in the day and bought mine and I said, where's my CD?
1350765	1351065	Nice.
1352426	1361430	I would say one of my favorites was not actually from the game at all, but was the soundtrack to the Mortal Kombat motion picture because that CD was awesome.
1362014	1364236	Mortal Kombat, test your mind.
1364256	1365757	I have that song somewhere I'll have to play it on break.
1366157	1366417	All right.
1366817	1368979	Anyway, let's move on to My Gaming Week.
1368999	1369959	I'll talk quickly about this.
1369979	1372201	Now, was that the Mortal Kombat game soundtrack?
1372221	1374422	No, the actual movie soundtrack was awesome.
1374442	1377965	Yeah, the movie soundtrack was awesome, but remember the one that they did for the game?
1378105	1378825	Less awesome.
1379206	1379786	Oh, come on.
1379826	1381307	That was very awesome.
1381427	1382648	It was so awesome.
1382668	1384269	We used to play Keyzer, that soundtrack.
1384950	1388352	And Spazinator is clarifying in chat that Mr. Bones was a Sega Saturn game.
1388812	1389512	That was it.
1389612	1395074	I was thinking about the Ghosts and Goblins kind of game that was on.
1397435	1398496	Never mind.
1398936	1399236	Let's see.
1399256	1400836	We got a lot of other comments and chats here.
1402177	1404178	Sorry, I was going to add one more thing to my gaming week.
1405018	1407099	It's not really my gaming week yet, but it will be.
1409381	1417027	Unless you haven't read my Twitter, I will be getting an iPod Touch.
1418048	1419229	Now, I know what you're thinking.
1419269	1421350	This goes against my total hatred of Macs.
1422271	1422411	Wrong.
1422431	1423432	And really Apple in general.
1424096	1430259	Well, I've kind of gotten blinded by the whole hating Macs because iPods are not Macs.
1430839	1432300	iPods are their own thing.
1432320	1436641	Sure, rationalize it however you can, Loki.
1437602	1438942	It's the Backpedal Express.
1441584	1444125	To be fair, I didn't pay for this with my own money.
1444745	1445945	I think that's what it really is.
1446025	1449587	If he's being given them, how can he say no?
1449687	1451948	I mean, they are still great MP3 players and stuff.
1452469	1454692	No, I think they're decent MP3s.
1454712	1458396	Well, I don't really give a crap about playing MP3s, but... Oh, they're game systems now, too.
1458476	1458737	Really?
1458777	1459478	Yeah.
1460899	1467928	But, you know, if they gave me the gift card and said you have to spend it on a Mac computer, I think I'd have issues.
1468088	1470591	But I'm fine with the new iPod.
1470751	1471752	FarFantasy10 Soundtrack for the Win
1492202	1494703	Redertainment says the music from Brutal Legend was awesome.
1494723	1497785	Too bad they never released a formal original soundtrack for that game.
1498385	1502828	And then Cyber Beast, I love this, chimes in with Daytona.
1504089	1507491	You know what game actually had one of the little side soundtracks that they did?
1507511	1509812	It was Final Fantasy Prey and Celtic Moon.
1510973	1514355	Those were both gorgeous arrangements of the music.
1514595	1516516	Was Prey the one that was all piano?
1516536	1517317	It was the ladies singing.
1519338	1519598	Okay.
1520119	1521159	Well, there's a third.
1521179	1526162	It had a lot that was on piano, but Celtic Moon was all the, you know, Celtic style.
1526223	1526563	Right, right.
1527103	1527523	Good stuff.
1527703	1527924	Yeah.
1528264	1528564	All right.
1529585	1529925	All right.
1530205	1531946	We'll be keeping an eye on chat throughout the night.
1531986	1533847	Chat.OrangeSoundsRadio.com.
1534488	1536889	Amazatsuma says, Loki, your soul is mine.
1536989	1537930	Love, Steve Jobs.
1538150	1538590	There you go.
1539611	1541292	I had to spend the gift card on something.
1541352	1544634	It was either that or, like, a bunch of the nanos.
1544674	1548677	And what the hell would I do with a bunch of nanos or a bunch of the shuffles or whatever?
1548882	1549663	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1577040	1583561	But what a lot of companies do sometimes is that if they're buying these cards in bulk, then there's a discount on them.
1583661	1590903	Like if a company buys $55 Starbucks cards to give away as an incentive, they might reduce the cost of that.
1591163	1592743	So that way they have no cash value.
1592803	1593884	They're not really gift cards.
1593924	1594924	They're like coupons.
1595564	1597244	And so then you can't do that.
1597604	1600565	So it really depends if someone paid full cash value up front or not.
1600865	1604586	Zeebo wants to know how you got the gift card.
1604706	1605246	What did you do?
1605306	1605967	Was it a present?
1606447	1607947	I don't know if you can talk about it.
1607967	1608727	No, I can talk about it.
1609248	1610488	It's not really anything I did.
1610648	1612069	It's actually what our video reps did.
1612109	1619031	Our video reps do sales incentives with Sony for various titles throughout the year.
1619931	1621932	We've gotten a bunch of things from Sony.
1622392	1626253	Thankfully, they do include us game reps even though we have nothing to do with this.
1626793	1629154	in on the, you know, little spiffs.
1629194	1640498	So, like, for example, we've gotten a Sony HDTV, we've gotten a surround sound system, a camcorder, and they got a PlayStation 3.
1640838	1643139	I wasn't included in that, but don't care, I already have one.
1643959	1649421	And then we're going to be getting, probably later on this year, a Sony-style card for $500.
1650902	1652842	So they actually gave us a $500 card for Apple.
1654383	1656946	T-ara suggested that you could buy a bunch of shuffles and throw them like ninja stars.
1668061	1673743	No, I decided, because I'm nice and a wonderful husband and stuff, I bought myself an iPod.
1674904	1676804	The new iPod Touch 8 gig.
1677305	1678705	One for myself and one for my wife.
1679565	1681306	To which she's like, what am I going to do with that?
1681386	1684667	I'm like, God, I should have just spent it... Put Bejeweled on it for her.
1685007	1686728	I was going... She doesn't care.
1686748	1688189	She's like, I can play Bejeweled online.
1689609	1691991	I'm like, well, you can browse the internet with that.
1692031	1695013	Well, can I just browse the internet anywhere or do I have to be on Wi-Fi?
1695033	1696254	Well, you have to be on Wi-Fi.
1696274	1697274	Well, that's stupid.
1697675	1698855	I'll just use my computer here.
1699136	1700096	Does Apple make diapers?
1700116	1701237	Because we could use those right now.
1702878	1707261	You should sell it and get the money so we can put it in our savings account.
1707281	1708782	That's always the answer for stuff.
1709202	1713365	So, you know, the next time when we get that Sony-style card, she isn't getting shit.
1713645	1714326	It's all mine.
1715347	1718589	Then again, though, I don't know what the hell I'd get from Sony-style for $500.
1719009	1720230	Nelly sounds like my mother.
1721651	1723653	It's just her Jewiness, I guess.
1725214	1725774	Oh, wait, wait.
1725874	1728056	DarkSakura can officially be offended by that now.
1729554	1731896	I don't care, I don't care
1752290	1753451	All right, let me talk about my gaming week.
1754011	1756293	My gaming week, I actually didn't play a whole lot of new stuff.
1756353	1757254	Most of the same old, same old.
1757334	1759175	I will talk about one new thing I played.
1759195	1761737	I got to get a sneak peek at something just like Loki did.
1762297	1767521	I got to play World of Warcraft Cataclysm, the beta for that, at least for a little bit.
1767741	1771144	It worked for like a morning and then I couldn't get in all day yesterday.
1771224	1773565	So Alan watched me play this too.
1773605	1774066	It was cool.
1774286	1775146	I rolled a Worgen.
1776246	1777407	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1802612	1803833	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1824461	1825382	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1842754	1870308	and when you collect the barrels then you have to walk up to the giant fat abomination creatures and you put the barrel on its head and then your character will yell fire and then the camera zooms back in a seamless motion and it goes back up to where you started the quest and there's a guy there with a gun and it shows him aiming it at the barrel and pulling the trigger and you watch the bullet fly with the camera and it hits the bullet and the abomination is saying something like uh oh me worried
1871028	1876550	and then the bullet hits the barrel which is filled with gunpowder and the dude explodes and chunks go everywhere.
1876590	1877290	It's awesome.
1877791	1878791	That sounds like fun.
1878871	1879811	It's getting hardcore.
1879851	1881612	I'm liking this stuff.
1881952	1893697	I didn't play the Goblin area yet but apparently they have a highway through the Goblin town and there's all these car racing Mario Kart type quests so they're getting crazy with all the different quests they have in the game.
1894177	1896298	I've heard it called Grand Theft Azura.
1896498	1896778	Really?
1897318	1898658	Because of all the little cars.
1898678	1899119	That's cool.
1900479	1902521	That's awesome.
1902981	1905383	The crack is saying your name, DarkSakura.
1906103	1911387	Actually, I was just thinking that something that would be fun is if I play Sims all throughout the show and have a house built by the end of the show.
1911808	1912388	If you want.
1912648	1914329	Or start it at 5.
1914650	1917412	I'll log into Star Trek Online.
1917492	1918673	No, I wouldn't do that.
1919453	1922395	Honestly, guys, I don't know what we're going to do once the regular show is over.
1922435	1924597	We're going to fill seven hours of radio somehow.
1924957	1925758	We'll figure out how we get there.
1926178	1926759	Worgan, Thumbs Up for Me
1949136	1949897	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1964654	1971596	Speaking of janky, did the Final Fantasy XI, or not XI, might as well be XI because it sucks.
1972276	1976017	Now, did the Final Fantasy XIV beta, the open beta start this week?
1976137	1976617	I don't remember.
1977077	1979618	Sort of, but a lot of people are having problems getting in.
1979658	1984339	I guess you have to actually register for the open beta, and they're only letting so many people in at a time.
1984359	1985440	Well, then that's a closed beta.
1985460	1986260	That's stupid.
1986540	1987860	I'm hearing they're having a lot of problems.
1988481	1991361	See, they're limiting the amount of people that can play the beta.
1991521	1992822	It's like the time, yeah.
1992862	1993082	Yeah.
1994122	1994463	It's crazy.
1994483	1994603	Yeah.
2013982	2015883	Yeah, that game's in a lot of trouble.
2017704	2018505	I'm worried.
2019345	2023548	They really, if they're smart, they're going to push back the release of that game and not try to release it.
2023568	2024868	But it might be too late now.
2024989	2025309	I don't know.
2026189	2030412	But also, speaking of release dates, playing this World of Warcraft beta got me thinking.
2030812	2032053	I don't think it's coming out this year.
2032593	2036035	Like, I know Blizzard has swore up and down that they're going to try and get it out this year.
2037036	2041338	If they make this year, mid-December is like the earliest you're going to see this game.
2041358	2042439	It'll be out before Christmas.
2042579	2042719	Yeah.
2043200	2044381	It's going to be mid-December then.
2044401	2047244	When you say before Christmas, you mean like two weeks before Christmas.
2047264	2054373	Before Christmas, because they've already sent out a map notice saying that their map stuff's ending on the 25th.
2054453	2054713	Really?
2054813	2057677	I feel like there's a lot left still.
2058397	2061238	of the beta process.
2061278	2068340	It doesn't really matter that they sent out that notice, but I'm just saying that right now, that's what they're saying is that it's going to be out before Christmas.
2068540	2074922	Well, they're probably waiting to announce the actual release date at BlizzCon, but I'm thinking mid-December because there's still all this stuff they've got to do.
2074982	2080483	They've got to do the actual patch for Cataclysm, which will probably be about three weeks before the game releases.
2080824	2085485	They've got to do the world event that leads up to the Cataclysm, which is another three weeks.
2085845	2091128	They've got to do one more patch still of the taking of Gnomeregan and Echo Islands.
2091148	2092329	That still has to happen too.
2092429	2097992	So there's still a good 10 weeks of plot content that has to happen before the game can come out.
2098573	2099974	So there's only so much time left.
2100074	2100654	So we'll see.
2101454	2101695	All right.
2102715	2104696	Let's move on to our guests and their gaming weeks.
2105437	2106257	Alan, how was your gaming week?
2108659	2109200	Pretty boring.
2109380	2110180	Same old, same old.
2110561	2112382	Maybe an hour or two of Zuma's Revenge.
2112482	2113163	Revisited that.
2113183	2113783	A lot of fun.
2113943	2114904	And then just a lot of WoW.
2116005	2116806	No real developments there.
2116826	2118287	What's your big WoW accomplishments lately?
2120517	2126260	I got enough rep with the oracles to buy their stupid egg that hatches once a week to try and get the mount from it.
2127300	2127921	That's about it.
2128641	2129041	Good times.
2129061	2129641	Very boring.
2129801	2130022	Yeah.
2130302	2130722	Good times.
2131382	2131582	All right.
2131682	2139806	Any other games that you like to play regularly outside of WoW just so the listeners don't think you play WoW all time all the day, although that may be what you actually do?
2142317	2142878	That's really it.
2144859	2145340	Come on.
2146040	2148182	Puzzle Quest 2, I've talked about that before.
2148642	2149964	Zuma's Revenge, like I just said.
2150064	2153406	I played Peggle on your phone, your new iPhone 4 that we got last week.
2154147	2154908	Peggle is crack.
2155568	2156629	Yeah, Peggle's really awesome.
2158101	2158381	All right.
2160903	2162844	Some of our listeners are saying the stream is skipping.
2163024	2168667	I don't know what's going on, but with a 12-hour show, I'm sure it's going to be a problem through a lot of it.
2168687	2171829	But just a reminder to everybody in studio, whatever bandwidth, you got to make sure.
2171909	2174290	I did forget to close my torrent, so I just closed it.
2174630	2174890	Uh-ohs.
2175151	2175731	Okay, there you go.
2176111	2177112	All right, maybe that'll help.
2177492	2177852	So we'll see.
2179093	2182094	If it still is skipping in about 10 minutes, I'll try rebooting the stream.
2182135	2182735	But meanwhile...
2183135	2188220	I think I kind of asked Bradley about his game of the week and he said he was doing mostly traveling, but I'll ask again if there's anything you want to throw out there, Bradley.
2188401	2194307	Okay, so there was no games this week, but I want to go with my last week because I was playing a bunch of games then.
2194327	2196609	I played Shadow Complex.
2197530	2198691	That's a fun game.
2199132	2201134	That was for last year's Summer Arcade.
2201214	2203156	I've actually bought all the ones for this year.
2203176	2203896	Nice.
2204577	2207778	Just mainly because I bought the four of them, so I bought Monday Night Combat as well.
2207798	2218302	I played through the demo, and it's a game I probably might play a little bit, but it's not one I'd play a lot because it's one of those team-based combat games I'm not big on.
2218742	2223304	Castlevania HD, I didn't play that last week, but I played through the game on that, and that's fun.
2223624	2228006	It's kind of one thing, as you said on one of the previous podcasts, was that...
2228726	2229127	DarkSakura.com
2247287	2247787	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2268994	2270094	That's how you do that one.
2271935	2275996	Let's see what the other games... Limbo, that one's actually a pretty cool game.
2276736	2278116	At least it's worth a play.
2279537	2287499	It might be a bit expensive for the $15 just because if the first playthrough of it, it only took me about three and a half hours, and if...
2287899	2288239	DarkSakura.com
2315387	2316068	Thanks for watching!
2338264	2339406	Laura Croft and the Guardian of Light?
2339486	2340928	Yeah, I did play that.
2340948	2342710	I played through the first four levels and that was pretty fun.
2343511	2347176	I haven't played the co-op because I haven't had a second person there to play it.
2348217	2349779	Sounds interesting from what you said last week.
2350440	2351481	Or two weeks ago, I think.
2351778	2354681	Yeah, I was definitely a fanboy for that game, I'm not even going to lie.
2354741	2357123	It was kind of one of those surprises.
2357263	2359285	I wasn't expecting to like it as much as I did.
2359345	2361747	I really wasn't, so it was cool.
2361907	2363508	I like the arcade feel of that game a lot.
2364109	2365730	It feels like playing Gauntlet, kind of.
2366070	2368272	Yeah, and I also played Burnout Revenge.
2368312	2374578	It's been like a year, almost nine or eight, ten months since I played it last, but I like the Burnout games as they're...
2374958	2380060	That's like arcade racing simulators, but arcade racing.
2380460	2383481	Just fun knocking people off the road and trying to get the thing.
2383781	2389762	Except for the burning laps and preview races where you have to beat a certain time are really annoying.
2389782	2394504	Because if you die, if you mess up one time, you have to restart the whole race and start over and over.
2394544	2398105	It takes like an hour to get a gold on it or a perfect rating on it.
2399125	2399405	All right.
2400867	2403869	Well, I guess that's going to do it for everybody's gaming weeks.
2404169	2405350	So, you all right over there?
2405511	2405811	Crash?
2405831	2407032	I just knocked my fork over.
2407052	2407612	Party foul.
2408353	2411075	It was my delicious food, which I'm not going to describe.
2411436	2412597	It's still very garlicky.
2413017	2413317	All right.
2413517	2414178	Nothing wrong with garlic.
2414761	2418585	Alright, let's move into some gaming news after we do some housekeeping tonight.
2418985	2423630	I don't have a whole lot to add other than we already talked about we're going to be going a long, long, long show tonight.
2424411	2426293	I'm trying to see if the skipping problem is resolved.
2426333	2427915	Looks like some people are saying, yeah, it's better.
2427975	2430017	Some are saying it's still going, so we'll see.
2430357	2431919	We'll give it a few more minutes to work itself out.
2433379	2440101	and otherwise I guess I'll say add us on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR and on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
2440121	2445223	If you follow us on there, we can give you updates so that you know if we're going to be doing a show early or whatever's going on.
2446183	2447403	Alright, let's get into some news.
2447463	2450764	Let's finally start talking some actual gaming news here today.
2451484	2454605	Big news out of Penny Arcade Expo, right Loki?
2455005	2456626	Oh yeah, this is kind of like...
2458679	2463041	Very surprising news, but I'm sure people are taking it with a grain of salt.
2463121	2470103	Duke Nukem Forever is coming out 2011 on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and PC.
2470763	2476505	It is now being developed by Gearbox Software with the help of 2K Games.
2477405	2505785	and they are finishing what 3D Realms took over 10 years to start I guess and it was playable on the show floor and it's everything Duke Nukem should be you know with being able to pee everywhere and you know blowjob into windows and you know strippers are there strippers strippers punting eyeballs across you know a football field
2507199	2507639	Good stuff.
2508300	2508640	All right.
2509300	2510321	Here's where I want to start.
2511762	2515204	This is obviously, yay, funny gaming news.
2515244	2517065	You know, like, hooray, it's finally happening.
2517105	2519806	But at the same time, there's a part of me that goes, okay, well, look.
2520527	2524789	I don't think this is really the same game that Duke Nukem Forever was originally going to be.
2525409	2530312	And, you know, that might be kind of a duh because it's probably been like five different games over the past 13 years.
2530392	2531633	Oh, I'm sure more than that, yeah.
2532173	2542706	But I honestly think after the closure of 3D Realms, I think these guys probably got the IP and probably nuked everything that had happened before.
2542786	2547211	I mean, I know they say that they've taken what 3D Realms started or whatever, but I go...
2547972	2549153	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Duke Nukem
2569529	2573951	This is a game where we cannot make a promise we cannot fulfill.
2575091	2582214	We need to get past the shock and awe and then we can go to all the retailers and first parties and work with our launch plan.
2583575	2584815	It will be coming out though.
2586776	2610918	I'm excited, I love the Duke Nukem games and to be honest, just from the screenshots and the little cam videos that they had of the gameplay it looks good, it looks like, you know, because I think they're really going to kind of keep the vibe of the old games in there and it's just going to be souped up now and Gearbox, you know, they've definitely got a good pedigree as far as first person shooters go so I'm pretty confident that they'll churn out a good game
2612228	2613269	Awesome.
2613349	2613970	Multiplayer.
2613990	2615311	They're not really showing a lot of that.
2615391	2618174	There will be good multiplayer though if Gearbox is involved.
2618314	2620516	I hope they do map editing and all that stuff.
2620877	2621617	I hope so too.
2621637	2622418	That would be awesome.
2622818	2628384	That was the most fun part of the original Duke Nukem was looking at all those custom maps that would come out for that.
2628584	2630925	Maybe the PC version, but I don't know about the 360 and PS3.
2631065	2632085	Parish the thought.
2632145	2633586	I don't know about that.
2633606	2635647	I know that's a topic near and dear to your heart, Alan, right?
2654076	2655197	Quaking with rage right now.
2655678	2655958	Yes.
2656399	2661325	Once Portal 2 is out, their next press release better have Half-Life in it.
2662626	2663187	Alright, we'll see.
2663942	2666243	All right, let's move on to another topic.
2666963	2672806	We'll know more about that game, I guess, closer to when it actually releases, which it sounds like is actually going to happen at some point.
2672886	2673206	Hooray.
2674107	2677028	Talking about another thing that's floating around out there.
2677048	2680050	I'm not sure if they're showing this at PAX, but I guess the news broke.
2680970	2684392	I actually heard about it thanks to the GameStop Managers Conference.
2684412	2686313	They were showing this, which was the week before PAX.
2687253	2695956	and I think a lot of the stuff that is at PAX now was probably at this conference like the week before but this was one of them and it has to do with the new Xbox 360 controller.
2696336	2699097	It's a redesign of the Xbox 360 wireless controller.
2699477	2700678	It's now going to be silver.
2700758	2707480	It kind of has this black, white, silver look to it with only the green being in the lights for the Xbox logo.
2707500	2708740	That's really the only place they are.
2709621	2713702	Otherwise, the other big change to this, a new D-pad.
2714142	2716083	Yay!
2716323	2719585	Finally, in America, they are fixing the D-pad.
2719625	2722206	But not only are they fixing it, it's really different.
2722786	2725647	What they're doing, it's a transforming D-pad.
2726068	2735192	What you can do, you can pop out the plus sign to have it just be the plus sign, or you can actually have a whole little like kind of...
2735612	2737093	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2764400	2766581	Well, I already know the answer to that, so I can't say.
2766601	2766581	45.
2767661	2768881	45 says... About-ish.
2769241	2769721	About-ish.
2769821	2770281	Here's the thing.
2770321	2772862	It's $64.99 for this new controller.
2772922	2773502	You know why?
2774062	2777843	They're only selling it with the Play and Charge kit as a bundle.
2778963	2780184	And it's a limited edition.
2780884	2786425	And there's a part of me that kind of goes, like, looks at that and goes, you little shits.
2786965	2790166	Like, you know your controller is a problem.
2791209	2793170	You've known this for a long time.
2793791	2799855	You've fixed it with limited releases, like some sort of tease, like time again in Europe.
2800495	2808020	And now that you're finally releasing something kind of a step beyond that here, you're going to gouge for it when it's like a problem in the first place?
2808180	2809841	Like, you suck.
2811002	2812823	You're a dick, whoever thought of this.
2813644	2813924	I mean...
2815222	2822492	I like the look to the controller though, even though it is a little weird that the buttons are not that yellow, blue, red, green.
2822552	2829441	Yeah, that's going to be wonderful for, I don't know, players that are new and that they have color, you know, little...
2832003	2834965	Indicators and stuff on the screen that correspond to those buttons.
2835445	2840108	Oh, the buttons don't have colors because they're black and white.
2840469	2841329	Why did they do that?
2841409	2842690	That's just dumb.
2844091	2849374	The only way I would see that being acceptable is if they were backlit with those actual colors.
2849414	2854318	So it looks gray when it's turned off, but actually has colors shining through when you turn it on.
2855318	2856379	But that's not the case with this.
2856719	2858100	That's just them being dumb.
2860453	2864376	Monty Boggs in our chatroom says, I'm sure the only thing limited is the bundle and color.
2864436	2866397	They will continue with the new D-pad.
2866918	2867178	Hmm.
2867538	2868739	I hope you're right on that.
2868919	2869379	I don't know.
2869439	2870820	They haven't really said on that, though.
2871661	2873322	Maybe this is a trial thing?
2873422	2876004	This is a trick to get you to buy it right now for $65.
2876064	2878946	So we'll see.
2879146	2881388	They're trying to get you suckers on an impulse buy.
2881408	2882008	That's what it is.
2882789	2883149	I don't know.
2883629	2883929	All right.
2884550	2885010	Let's move on.
2885050	2886111	DarkSakura, what do you got for us?
2886618	2903077	Well, in the realm of PlayStation, they were sending out a survey seeing if people would be interested in having a digital comic service on the PS3 and not just on the PSP.
2904658	2928805	and um so I'm not sure if they're actually going to do that now but I mean it would be kind of neat being able to read my comics on the TV although honestly I can just look at my digital comics on my computer and we have a computer hooked up to our TV in the front room so big diff um I think nothing's really going to replace you know actually having paper in your hand and reading the comic and going ooh pretty you know
2930085	2932546	But for those that want it, it's available.
2933046	2933986	Well, good for them.
2934066	2937427	If Sony wants to do it, good for them.
2937487	2938927	Maybe they'll get something out of it.
2939508	2942648	I don't know that it's going to be worth the expenditure.
2944049	2945949	I'll read comics on my iPhone.
2945989	2947410	Having it handheld, that's one thing.
2947950	2949290	Yeah, those are a little more portable.
2949410	2953111	You don't have to take a book that you'd worry about ruining.
2953191	2955792	Oh, I'm at work right now and I want to read a comic.
2956580	2959121	I mean, I'm not at work and want to read a comic.
2959541	2960281	I'm on my lunch.
2960781	2962442	Yeah, I'm on my lunch break and want to read a comic.
2962582	2964042	I have my break sign up all day.
2969143	2971624	I'm surprised you haven't brought this up in your comic podcast yet.
2972064	2975445	You taped a comic podcast this morning, right?
2975465	2978106	Yeah, but we focus more on the comics themselves.
2978166	2978486	I see.
2978946	2980046	And where can they download that?
2980066	2983287	I'll let you work in a cheap plug for your new old spinoff show.
2983692	2987058	InfamousGamers.net is the site.
2987238	2989782	It's no I, there's just an N. Infamous.
2989802	2991084	The letter N. Nice.
2993519	2995400	Oh, it's actually just Infamous.net, yeah.
2995800	2997601	It used to be InfamousGamers.com.
2998721	3004883	But in the meantime, though, you also can find easier links right now on our various Twitters and whatnot.
3005304	3005724	Very cool.
3006324	3007504	All right.
3007604	3008385	Good luck with that, by the way.
3008405	3011586	And you're totally a sucker for having done that already this morning.
3011646	3015027	So you've already been broadcasting for an hour or two, right?
3015107	3016228	We were Skype-casting.
3016528	3017128	Skype-casting?
3017488	3017868	That works.
3017888	3019109	That's how we do it, is Skype.
3019129	3019229	Skype.
3019389	3020590	And when do your new episodes come out?
3020670	3023191	And every so often we get Dalek voice.
3023471	3025192	You tape today, but it'll come out what, tomorrow?
3025292	3025592	Tomorrow.
3025732	3026492	Okay, very cool.
3026772	3029453	So I've got, after we're done here, I've got editing to do.
3029673	3030214	Fun!
3030554	3031314	Good luck with that.
3032295	3032595	All right.
3033255	3035616	All right, moving on to more stories, Loki.
3037361	3039802	So, it's kind of funny.
3040163	3049948	Medal of Honor, a big game that's going to be coming out from EA this October, is actually banned from military bases.
3050048	3054530	At least GameStop's located in military bases.
3055211	3063916	Apparently, this is a decision, I guess, by GameStop and also with, I believe...
3065737	3075001	They said the PX Commanding General of the Army and Air Forces Exchange Services.
3075441	3077743	I guess I made the decision about that.
3079383	3084966	So it says GameStop has agreed out of respect for our past and present men and women in uniform.
3085026	3087928	We will not carry Medal of Honor in any of our...
3088468	3089289	A.A.F.E.S.
3089389	3098896	based stores at this time does not include our four stores on marine installations GameStop fully supports the A.A.F.E.S.
3099557	3109785	in this endeavor and it is sensitive to the fact in multiplayer mode one side will assume the role of Taliban fighters
3110505	3118367	As such, GameStop has agreed to have all marketing materials pulled by noon today and stop taking reservations.
3118427	3127330	Customers who entered our AAFES stores and wish to reserve metal can and should be directed to the nearest GameStop location off base.
3128050	3138713	Again, we appreciate the sensitivity and know our AAFES based stores will continue to honor the great customer base in which they serve.
3140188	3144351	And of course that is because the Taliban are in multiplayer.
3144551	3149034	Oh yes, because our soldiers can go and fight in Iraq and stuff like that.
3149554	3155058	But oh my god, the Taliban's in a video game and then we're going to flip out because they can't handle that.
3156119	3156999	It's dumb.
3157820	3162263	That's just like saying we should remove all the Germans out of Call of Duty because, you know...
3164632	3165092	I don't know.
3165132	3167953	I would find it a little weird in the first place.
3167993	3169734	I mean, not weird, but I would...
3182409	3183770	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3200928	3203390	Don't you want to play Mario Kart or something?
3231188	3231248	Oil.
3246175	3255759	Well, yeah, I understand it's oil as well, but, I mean, there's still the fighting for freedom kind of crap because, you know, you're trying to save everybody from the terrorists.
3255879	3259120	So, I just, I don't understand what the big deal is.
3259240	3270004	What's also interesting is that they're really not the first, you know, country, U.S., to take issue with this because I think we had a story on the show last week, right, about the British had a problem with this game too.
3270584	3274326	And we're talking about banning it, I think, in Britain completely.
3274346	3274426	Yeah.
3275026	3275767	GameStop GameStop GameStop
3293486	3295988	Redertainment in our chatroom kind of reiterates a point here.
3296068	3300430	We also support the ability of people in the military to go off base and buy the game.
3300570	3302711	Again, go off base and buy the game.
3303352	3307474	So, you know, it's not like the game is banned altogether.
3307514	3312797	I mean, that would kind of be against the Constitution, but, you know, they don't have to support it, I suppose.
3313597	3313717	So...
3314918	3321724	It's just something that they did because they think it's, you know, out of respect to those who serve, we will not be stocking this game.
3322805	3327669	And they apologize for any inconvenience it may have caused.
3327969	3330051	But at the same time, they're like, well, just go off base and buy it.
3330752	3333935	I don't understand what the big deal is then.
3334415	3338679	If you were saying, oh, well, we don't want it on the base because that sets the wrong precedent.
3338739	3341681	But you can buy it off base and bring it back in.
3341721	3342222	That's fine.
3342242	3342602	Yeah.
3343499	3349103	Alright, let's talk about something a little less serious than these types of games and talk about something a little more casual, shall we?
3349663	3351925	This is also news that's coming out of Penny Arcade Expo.
3352645	3356047	It's a brand new crossover game from Telltale Games.
3356448	3359570	You might remember there was a teaser that I believe we brought up on the show last week.
3360530	3373359	So let's see, if you could imagine, what would Homestar Runner, the guys from Penny Arcade, Sam and Max, and now Team Fortress 2 characters, what are they all going to do in a new game together?
3373999	3374559	Blow shit up?
3400085	3403306	They are apparently showing off the game right now at PAX.
3403326	3405006	They've got posters and all that good stuff.
3406046	3407867	Dan Connors, the CEO of Telltale,
3427037	3433920	So it sounds like this game is going to have a lot of smack talking in it, which might be kind of cool, because Homestar Runner talking shit will actually be really funny, I think.
3435441	3437182	I think you're a stupid poopy head.
3440824	3441204	We'll see.
3441964	3447527	What I think is another thing to kind of draw out of that quote, we pitched the idea to friends in the industry.
3448347	3449208	So they got...
3449639	3450399	Team Fortress 2
3479042	3479482	Seaman Seaman Seaman
3504852	3506354	Maybe the chick from Mirror's Edge.
3507094	3509277	I could see EA and Steam have a close relationship.
3509297	3517385	And one of the unicorns from that stupid game on Steam.
3517425	3518466	The Pink Honest game?
3518867	3519968	Yeah.
3520128	3525614	Or if you're talking PC, how about an orc and a night elf?
3526522	3527543	Lady Gaga Lady Gaga
3548420	3550121	Some people have too much time on their hands.
3550241	3551882	It was actually kind of good.
3552682	3554203	I put it up there and you didn't even look.
3554583	3555103	I'm sorry.
3555123	3555823	When did you put it up?
3556063	3556604	Yesterday.
3556824	3558545	Well, I've been busy the past couple days.
3558645	3561486	I was busy sleeping yesterday, I'll have you know.
3561826	3562286	You how?
3562306	3564007	Two naps.
3564687	3565588	What's this, Alan?
3566968	3568569	Rob took two naps yesterday.
3569469	3570470	Two two-hour naps.
3571170	3571710	An old man.
3572371	3573031	He's very cute.
3574272	3575092	Shut up, don't judge me.
3575993	3577494	Oh, Jay Dizzle, perfect answer.
3577594	3579334	Duke Nukem should be in the game.
3579535	3579995	Hello?
3580015	3582516	Because, you know, it's going to be a big release coming up.
3582556	3583256	I like that answer.
3584017	3584297	All right.
3584777	3587878	Anyhow, let's move on and talk about more gaming news.
3587938	3591140	Release date's coming up in just a moment, but first, DarkSakura has something for us.
3591580	3593741	Mine's not really so much of a story, so much as an impression.
3594742	3598583	The new screen caps for the Mortal Kombat game that's coming out are up.
3599524	3601565	And it looks really fun.
3602366	3602807	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3622267	3623888	Yeah, that's what the word is.
3624688	3638213	I'm looking really at what I'm telling just from the images and it seems to me like there's this one scene in here with Katana, let me find her, where she's just covered in blood and it's fantastic.
3638754	3649178	And Melina has her horrible, ugly eat your face face and everything just looks like what Mortal Kombat used to be except for being 3D instead of
3652128	3654609	being, you know, the motion cap.
3670036	3674178	To be fair, I didn't play the DC Universe game, but I played pretty much all the others.
3674258	3680702	I really enjoyed the first couple, what was it, Deception, and there was another one in there too.
3680842	3683244	Not the last one they did with all the kids.
3683264	3684544	Thank you, Deadly Alliance.
3684584	3685885	That was actually a decent game.
3685965	3686986	Deadly Alliance is awesome.
3687026	3688687	I love the little RPG thing in there.
3688827	3696331	Yeah, you know, even those mini modes, some of them were kind of stupid, like in Deception they had the kart racing and stuff, which was definitely an afterthought, but I ate that shit up.
3696371	3697232	I thought it was awesome.
3697452	3698834	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3713608	3713948	Awesome.
3714308	3715349	And that would be fantastic.
3715509	3719810	I want there to be special stage fatalities for every stage.
3720351	3720591	I hope so.
3720611	3721771	Because I want more blood.
3721971	3730735	It sounds like these new IP owners, Warner Brothers is taking care of this now after Midway, although a lot of the people that used to be involved are involved now.
3730775	3735856	It really sounds like they're just like, okay, after that DC... They interviewed Ed Boon about it a few months ago.
3736077	3736297	Yeah.
3736657	3740378	After that DC Universe game, let's just give the fans what they want.
3740498	3741999	Let's just go balls to the wall.
3742779	3746782	We want a Street Fighter 4-esque type of upgrade.
3746902	3752125	Because Street Fighter 4 was a fucking awesome upgrade from old school Street Fighter.
3752165	3754847	So I think that's what they're going to give us with this new Mortal Kombat game.
3754927	3760171	I'm looking at this red guy here and he's throwing the scorpion little chain thing.
3760811	3762093	Is that Ermac?
3762213	3764596	Or is that the ninja from Deadly Alliance?
3764656	3765457	Whatever his name was.
3765497	3766138	I can't remember his name.
3766158	3766658	I don't know.
3766759	3768941	But there's another thing that I wouldn't mind seeing.
3768961	3769682	I think he's Ermac.
3769942	3773006	You remember Soul Calibur's create a fighter thing?
3773427	3776310	And you can create certain ones that have actually a story to it?
3776831	3777732	I think that would be...
3779468	3780589	Reptile, Spitting, Splashy, Acid Vomit
3796089	3798390	They do a pretty good job on the Soul Calibur games, though.
3798410	3799090	I will give you that.
3799110	3805351	Probably my second favorite series of fighting games behind Mortal Kombat, and yes, even above Street Fighter, is Soul Calibur.
3805471	3819194	Those games are really badass, and I'm really waiting for news on Soul Calibur V. I'm kind of sitting here going, okay, it's about time to hear about Soul Calibur V, because the Yoda and Darth Vader days have long passed, so I'd like to know what's up with that.
3819482	3820983	There's, like, the robot dudes.
3822164	3822764	Cyrax.
3823164	3826606	I like that they've pulled a lot of the stuff that people liked from the other series.
3826947	3828227	I've actually got high hopes for this.
3828547	3828988	Yeah.
3829088	3832550	For any of our friends, though, that are at PAX, I want to hear what you think about it.
3832890	3843757	I'm liking that it looks like a lot of the roster for Mortal Kombat 3, except they kind of, at least so far, looks like they've said Sia to a lot of the characters that just really weren't notable out of those games, like Striker.
3844217	3845538	Like, you know, who... I liked him.
3845558	3846118	Who played Striker?
3846158	3846658	Oh, come on.
3846718	3847699	I did play him, actually.
3847719	3848379	Oh, come on.
3848399	3848640	He sucks.
3848660	3849060	Because...
3849720	3852903	If you knew how to use him right, he was really, really awesome.
3853903	3857726	And he had this one-punch combo that was super sweet.
3858167	3860388	I will say I loved Cabal.
3861029	3862150	I played Cabal.
3862230	3868114	He was awesome, and I don't think he's really coming back because he wasn't really notable in the mythology.
3868134	3868995	He had the run thing.
3869275	3872097	Yeah, that was cheap, and I loved Sindel.
3872577	3873218	I loved Sindel.
3873258	3877340	Sindel was badass, but again, what was she really there to do?
3877421	3881303	She was there to be the one dude's wife, and then she kind of disappears.
3881863	3884705	She didn't really... Or no, she's Katana's mom, though, isn't she?
3885026	3887948	I think so, and the other one was the Goro chick.
3888488	3890589	Yeah, I didn't care for her.
3890729	3890910	What?
3891490	3891810	Shiva.
3892090	3892891	Shiva, that was it.
3893031	3893631	I didn't care for her.
3894012	3895573	Like, oh, what a derivative name that is.
3896273	3898895	But I really like Sindel and her scream thing.
3900922	3903243	And really, like I said, it's not exactly a story.
3903503	3906084	And if anyone wants to see the images, just go to Eurogamer.net.
3906885	3911126	But they're really... I'm actually excited about a Mortal Kombat game.
3911747	3915948	VidPower in our chatroom says, Striker is the Dan of the Mortal Kombat universe.
3916729	3919450	Hey, if you can win a game with Dan, you're pretty awesome, right?
3921016	3938744	Nice, I like that Derek H in our chatroom By the way, I neglected to say this last week on the show And I really need to give a big holler and thank you to Derek H for the big battle Which wrapped up last week Even though we got our butts kicked by the host country, Dead Picks Alive You know how that usually happens in the Olympics?
3938824	3948369	The host country usually wins And Dead Picks Alive won We made a really good job second place So thank you to all the listeners who helped out in the big battle there And I just want to give kudos to Derek for putting that all together
3948909	3951350	I do the same thing with Cammy Cammy's actually a good character too
3971267	3976071	Oh, Alan, just like his eyes got really big and he's looking like, I'm gonna cut this bitch.
3976091	3976711	Dan hates Cammy.
3977051	3977672	Dan hates Cammy.
3977732	3978532	Dan's yelling from the other room.
3978572	3980834	Okay, so you like Cammy, right?
3980854	3982315	Yes, yes, she's amazing.
3982835	3989840	And my favorite thing that she does is the little mid-air combos where she spins and then goes into a different kick or a punch or something.
3990341	3990801	What are they called?
3990821	3991902	The hooligan combos, I think?
3992002	3993063	Here's my thing with Cammy.
3993663	3995284	I like her as a character.
3995845	3998847	And you know Kylie Minogue playing her in the movie was the best thing ever.
3999167	4000988	That was the only good thing about the movie.
4001088	4006032	I like her as a character, but as a street fighter, God, I hate her.
4007353	4008774	She's so useless.
4009214	4010015	Actually, no, I take that back.
4010055	4012196	T-Hawk is probably the most useless street fighter.
4013057	4014238	She just has a nice ass.
4014278	4014998	That's about it.
4015218	4016539	They drew her with a nice ass.
4017260	4019141	That's really the only good thing.
4019642	4020382	This is my thing.
4021563	4024205	It doesn't matter how much someone says a character sucks.
4024325	4026747	If you enjoy playing them and you're good at them...
4027972	4029093	Everybody else better watch out.
4029133	4032977	That's the trash-talking roots of the gaming universe.
4033637	4037341	What you believe to be true is law, and everybody else is stupid.
4039863	4043246	Everybody can agree that you'd probably look better naked than T-Hawk anyway.
4044807	4047310	T-Hawk would be disproportionate if he actually didn't have clothes on.
4047590	4047790	Anyway.
4049440	4049840	No penis.
4053323	4053543	Wow.
4054123	4057966	Anyway, the whole point is, it's just like with video games.
4058146	4061088	Games are only as good as the system they're on.
4061969	4063150	Not the system they're on.
4063270	4066052	A system is only as good as the games that are on it.
4066392	4070095	Well, then a character is only as good as the player playing.
4071530	4076133	Take my Kami bashing with a grain of salt because I love Fei Long.
4076353	4078314	He's my favorite character in Street Fighter.
4079215	4080876	I think he's badass.
4081456	4085058	I enjoy playing Sakura, but that's just because she's fun because she does her little hop thing.
4085438	4085679	You?
4085819	4086539	Playing Sakura?
4086579	4087880	Karin was really good.
4089343	4089723	Gambit and Cammy
4111705	4113166	X-Men vs. Street Fighter
4137148	4139750	Yes, there's some decent stuff coming out this week.
4139810	4143852	It's starting to ramp up a little bit because we're getting into the long fourth quarter.
4145414	4150037	So starting things off, Batman the Brave and the Bold on Wii and DS this week.
4150877	4156081	Spider-Man Shattered Dimensions on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and DS.

4209561	4212282	NHL Slapshot.
4212342	4217384	That's the crappy Wii game with the hockey stick controller.
4217604	4219004	Yeah, you're not going to break a TV with that.
4220985	4222045	Sports Champions!
4222065	4222666	That's the fun part!
4222906	4236050	When you're at your friend's house and he beats you in NHL, whatever, whatever, and he's like, yeah, ha, I beat you, you suck, ha ha, you can just start bashing the TV in with your controller saying, ha, well, I fucked up your TV, later, bitch.
4236910	4242797	Sports Champions, the Wii Sports type game for the PlayStation Move.
4243097	4245920	Once again, this will make a nice coaster for the next two weeks.
4247442	4251907	Saints Row Double Pack, it's a re-release of the two Saints Row games on Xbox 360 for only $29.99.
4251947	4252247	There's also a...
4258314	4258935	Let's see here.
4259035	4263899	Brunswick Cosmic Bowling Game, which I'm sure is not terrible at all on the Wii.
4265140	4265800	Uh, Ruse.
4266240	4271204	It's the real-time strategy game that you can bluff in on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.
4271305	4275748	Uh, Aeon Assault on, uh, Valeria.
4276048	4277650	Looks like that's how you pronounce that.
4277690	4279231	Probably fucked that up.
4279771	4281253	Uh, that's on PC.
4282153	4283194	Uh, Start the Party.
4283374	4286337	It's gonna be a real party in your house when you're staring at this, uh,
4286957	4291642	in this Blu-ray case, and that's on the PS3.
4292143	4292703	What is it?
4293544	4294805	How do you start the party?
4295746	4300051	Start the party by buying the party supplies in preparation for two weeks.
4300091	4301653	What is this fucking game, Loki?
4301733	4303014	What are you doing?
4303254	4304636	You know, iToyPlay?
4305577	4307539	Think of that, but now with the PlayStation Move controller.
4310852	4319518	Kung Fu Rider, a game so terrible it's actually probably more fun to stare at the case than actually play it.
4320138	4323100	That'll be coming out as well on the PlayStation 3 this week.
4324721	4329744	Photo World, it's a game where you take photos with a DSi camera.
4330165	4331686	And yes, it's a DSi only game.
4331926	4332466	That's awesome.
4332506	4335528	I can do stuff that I don't know, I can do without the game.
4335648	4336249	With the game.
4336389	4338210	That sounds more useful than Ping Pals.
4339508	4339788	on the DS.
4339848	4340869	Yeah, almost.
4342551	4345734	The Sims 3 Fastlane stuff.
4345894	4346995	I got to read this in our chat room.
4347235	4350618	First off, I got to catch up on some chat comments because the chat's starting to fill up here.
4350678	4351999	Thanks to you guys for tuning in early.
4352019	4352700	We really appreciate it.
4352720	4354301	There's quite a few of you here tonight, so thank you guys.
4354582	4355743	Chat.orangehamsradio.com.
4356523	4356844	Let's see.
4356904	4358045	Where was that?
4358185	4358485	Oh, yeah.
4358505	4360207	I wanted to say this about Rose.
4360647	4364891	Derek H., who brought up Cammy in the first place, actually says, I destroy people with Rose.
4365231	4365832	Destroy.
4366792	4367253	So there you go.
4367353	4368454	Illusion Spark, bitches.
4369034	4372397	So it looks like you and Derek have a lot in common because you're both Cammy and Rose players.
4373197	4373538	Let's see.
4374578	4375199	Where was I?
4375219	4376000	Oh, yeah.
4376240	4376940	Start the party.
4377060	4378441	Red Entertainment says start the party.
4378802	4380783	Gin, vodka, and hot women not included.
4381804	4382284	Or fun.
4382364	4384426	I do have vodka and tequila.
4385026	4385267	Do you?
4385487	4385647	Yes.
4385687	4386528	Do you want some?
4386588	4386968	Yeah.
4387288	4388609	We're going to start the party right now.
4389730	4391631	Seriously, I need everyone to drink up my booze.
4392915	4397380	I'll have a little bit, but keep in mind, I gotta drive home when this is all over, so I'll get... You've got hours to get sober.
4397400	4398881	I'll have a drink or two.
4398901	4401644	Well, I could also run out and get dinner at some point, so I'll have, like, a beer.
4401664	4402165	Do you have a Guinness?
4402185	4403106	I want a Guinness.
4403206	4403867	No, I don't have a Guinness.
4403907	4404988	I have two Newcastles left.
4405618	4407278	Oh, Newcastle, Newcastle, Newcastle, Newcastle.
4407298	4408199	A few more games this week.
4408219	4408919	You can have Newcastle.
4409739	4410079	Oh, sorry.
4410239	4412459	UFC Undisputed 2010 on PSP.
4414560	4417200	Prison Tycoon Alcatraz, once again delayed.
4417240	4419881	Thank you, Value Soft, for not being able to hit your damn street dates.
4420521	4423521	Dawn of Heroes on DS, speaking of delayed games.
4423881	4425542	That'll be coming out this week, maybe.
4426602	4428602	King's Bounty Armored Princess.
4429943	4431083	Not sure what that is, but...
4432023	4432783	Yeah, it's on PC.
4433464	4439426	And finally, Professor Layton and the Unwound Future on Nintendo DS.
4439446	4441007	That comes out one week from today.
4443147	4443708	That is it.
4444248	4444528	All right.
4445028	4448730	Let's move on and talk about Japanese release dates, looking at what's coming out in Japan.
4449470	4453412	Starting off with the Xbox 360 on September 9th.
4453892	4459154	UFC Undisputed 2010 is coming out on the Xbox 360 for those that are into that.
4461099	4461439	Excuse me.
4461739	4466021	Moving on to the PlayStation 3 and checking out what's coming out over there.
4467222	4467962	If I can find it.
4468403	4468803	There we go.
4469323	4472385	Split Second gets its Japanese release this week on the PlayStation 3.
4473085	4475806	Also, UFC Undisputed 2010 gets a release there, too.
4475886	4477847	By the way, next week, Front Mission Evolved.
4478307	4479508	Just so you know, that's on the 16th.
4480668	4482930	Wanted to get that out there because I know there's a lot of Front Mission fans.
4482950	4484630	It's kind of a cultish type of game.
4485571	4487792	Looking at the Wii and what's coming out on the Wii...
4489238	4491859	We have Okami getting a price cut this week on the Wii.
4492360	4498362	Biohazard 4 is also getting a price cut and the Biohazard Chronicles.
4498723	4502164	That of course is Resident Evil, what they call that series over there is Biohazard.
4502945	4511489	Looking at the handheld systems on the Nintendo DS, One Piece Gigant Battle from Bandai Namco is coming out on the DS this week.
4511949	4515590	I have no idea what that game is all about, but I'm assuming it's going to be a giant battle.
4532356	4533818	That's what it's called.
4554267	4556769	DarkSakura, what's coming out in Europe?
4556809	4565994	On the 6th we have Chime for PC and then the 7th is Dragon Age Origins Witch Hunt and Mass Effect 2 Lair of the Shadow Broker and on the 8th we have Amnesia The Dark Descent and Plants vs. Zombies which is crack.
4581904	4606806	and then on the 10th we have Ace Combat Joint Assault, Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep and Tom Clancy's Hawks 2 which I don't know I'm still kind of giddy about Birth by Sleep but this amnesia thing sounds kind of interesting I was looking up a little bit about it too that I think it would be interesting to to see that one but
4608041	4609504	Is that coming out in the US?
4609885	4610486	Amnesia?
4610826	4612930	The Dark Descent.
4613010	4614794	It's from Frictional Games.
4615653	4615933	Nope.
4617433	4623255	If it does, it'll be ported over by Zoo Games because they love taking European releases and bringing them out over here.
4623775	4624455	Eventually.
4624895	4625315	Eventually.
4625355	4631817	After they delayed them for months and months and months and months and months and months and months and months and months and months and months.
4631837	4633517	But Plants vs. Zombies, that game is kind of crack.
4633777	4639778	I mean... I'm actually looking... See, I'm looking forward to downloading that on the iPod when it comes in.
4639838	4642279	Supposed to get it next week because they're not yet released.
4642799	4645081	It's supposed to be out on DS in January.
4645682	4645922	Yes.
4646823	4647043	Yes.
4648544	4655411	But, you know, me being kind of a noob to the whole app store and stuff, I'm very pleased that they're not that expensive.
4655811	4664760	Except, I was actually shopping for something to use as like a Garmin or, you know, some sort of GPS thing.
4665060	4670121	To add GPS to the iPod Touch is ridiculously expensive.
4670682	4673302	I believe it's a TomTom adapter.
4673322	4677303	It's $79.99 just for the GPS adapter.
4677583	4680324	Then they want you to pay another $40 for the fucking app.
4680744	4688666	To which I gave them the big middle finger and said, fuck you, I will just look up directions on Google Maps and I'm smart enough as a human being to figure out how to get there.
4689147	4691867	I do not need you to tell me how to get there for almost $120.
4694748	4694928	Yeah.
4695168	4698630	I better be getting free blowjobs for $120 from that thing, you know.
4698650	4701271	It's just, it's not worth it.
4701572	4711717	Well, and honestly, I mean, if you've got, you may as well just use Google Maps, because seriously, it's kind of like irritating, I think, when you have the speaking GPS.
4712645	4718207	Yeah, I am going to get, though, I want to get one of these Virgin Mobile MiFis 2200s.
4718267	4724269	Now, I know that the MiFi 2200 is actually available through a bunch of different, like Verizon and Sprint and stuff like that.
4724349	4727130	But they're way more expensive and you have to have a contract.
4727691	4728991	So I'm cheap.
4730152	4731892	And sometimes I don't want to pay my bills.
4732032	4733853	So this is perfect.
4735720	4737683	Oh, I heard about those devices.
4737743	4738644	I kind of want to get one.
4738924	4739565	I'm serious.
4739665	4741808	I'm getting one for, we could do it for podcasting.
4741828	4743290	You can connect with the five devices.
4743370	4745653	We can do like podcasting anywhere.
4746054	4750420	Plus, I'm just going to shove it in my pocket and I can use my iPod Touch like, you know,
4750700	4751720	Like a phone, basically.
4751780	4754322	I would worry about podcasting over 3G, though.
4754462	4757063	Because we skip enough on this stream as it is.
4757103	4762025	Yeah, 3G's not... It's like an average DSL connection.
4762065	4765806	I mean, it's not horrible as long as you're in a decent area.
4765906	4768968	But, I mean, I don't know.
4769008	4771709	I wouldn't exactly use it for podcasting all the time.
4771749	4774610	Maybe just surfing the web while I'm...
4775038	4775818	Out there.
4775858	4781721	I like the iPhone as far as surfing the web and stuff, but I don't want to pay the fees each month for it.
4781821	4786483	Also, I don't really need the phone stuff too much.
4786623	4789945	I use maybe, if I'm lucky, 30 minutes a month.
4790465	4793866	All these cell phone plans are way too expensive for what they give me.
4794226	4800029	Although, I have been looking at... They've been advertising the new Virgin Mobile ones, too, for $25 a month for everything.
4800049	4801610	It's just I don't like the phones for that.
4802250	4803310	That's the only bad thing.
4803350	4803791	If it was like...
4804851	4807594	and iPhone for $25 a month then I'd be all over that shit.
4809096	4809656	Anyway, sorry.
4809776	4813420	I'm not trying to sound like a peddler for Virgin Mobile.
4814861	4821808	So let's talk about the PlayStation 3 and all sorts of weird stuff going on in the mod chip world there.
4822709	4836318	Um, you may remember the PlayStation Jailbreak was, um, announced last week, and of course, you know, for a very expensive hundred and, I don't remember how much it was, $70 or something like that for it.
4836839	4843923	Well, funny enough, um, you know, there was a temporary injunction placed on them last week where they were prevented from selling it until the 31st.
4844844	4846445	DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4873179	4887180	So everyone that bought one had their money returned, which is awesome because at the same time, the people that may have been buying them from Ozmodchips or even in the US, now Sony is going after the US manufacturers or I should say resellers.
4888040	4905432	Um, they're going at, uh, against, uh, against ZumbaLDC, whose, um, website shopsjailbreak.com has been, uh, selling a new PS3 jailbreak mod chips for the very expensive price of like a hundred and, you know, a hundred and some dollars.
4906593	4909776	PS Groove is an open source mod chip that runs off of a TNC++ USB development board or an 1890 USB key.
4929677	4932219	Both of those run under $30-some dollars.
4932299	4942245	It's $24 for the one and about $31 for the other, which is a lot cheaper than $100-some dollars.
4942885	4956333	And what's great about that is the part that kind of pissed off Sony with the whole backup manager, they actually have disabled the backup manager, but then of course people have released modified versions that have the backup manager in there again, but...
4956973	4959335	It is a solution that is now widely available.
4959435	4968323	So Sony, by snipping this other one in the butt, kind of made themselves a bigger problem.
4968824	4978432	And so now they're actually porting the PlayStation Groove to the PSP, which will run as an application on there, on a homebrew console.
4979973	4986699	So you'll actually be able to use your PSP for free to mod your PlayStation 3 if you have that.
4987039	4994265	Or if you can't wait for that to come out and you happen to have a Nokia N900, you can actually do that for free now.
4995026	5003873	And you can connect that to your PlayStation 3 using the special port of the PlayStation Groove to crack your system.
5003953	5004113	So...
5006115	5006936	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5026690	5040599	The stealth version of it, which isn't entirely stealth yet because they haven't erased all the old ID code out of it, is making the game look like, or making it look like you're playing a copy of Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2, which a lot of people out there are, so it would be hard to track them down.
5041940	5043661	But it's only going to get worse for them now.
5043821	5052366	Because once you have this system out now to actually mod your system, people are going to find out ways to do custom firmwares and it only goes from there.
5052386	5053407	It's just going to snowball.
5055785	5057326	Is there anything Sony can do about all this?
5057826	5058767	I don't know if they can.
5059147	5063550	I mean, other than, you know, maybe they can fix the hack.
5063890	5074437	But apparently, from what I was reading, though, the way that they actually... This exploit is done is actually before the firmware.
5074557	5078059	So to patch it with the firmware might be impossible.
5078539	5080140	It's before the firmware actually kicks in.
5080260	5080501	So...
5081461	5089067	It's impossible maybe to do that, but they may be able to block the ID for the backup manager or something like that.
5090088	5098094	If it's that easy to change the game ID on the backup manager, that won't really be an issue because they can just keep changing it to keep dodging any blocks that they put in place.
5099194	5100455	So it'll be interesting.
5101795	5107117	Definitely they're going to be doing another update soon for either PlayStation Move stuff.
5107137	5112179	I know they already have that Move stuff available right now, the firmware for that.
5112339	5117501	But they're going to be doing the 3D Blu-ray stuff and who knows what other patches later on.
5117521	5120122	I mean, they're going to try to patch it, that's for sure.
5120222	5124204	But I have a feeling it's going to go back and forth just like the whole PSP stuff.
5124284	5127126	But you won't be able to play online with this, right?
5127226	5128947	They'll be able to get that, right?
5129548	5132770	As of right now, see, here's the thing with online.
5133251	5141557	See, that's the issue with playing with the backup manager because it shows that ID code and they can go, okay, this person's playing online with this ID code.
5141897	5143118	Okay, they're using the backup manager.
5143258	5143878	Ban.
5143898	5144739	We ban their console.
5145680	5149102	But they're changing it to mimic Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2.
5149302	5151124	It'll look like, oh, they're playing Modern Warfare 2.
5153371	5155073	and then they're not going to ban them.
5155614	5167770	So if they successfully mask the backup manager and make it look like Modern Warfare 2 then there really is nothing they can do as far as detecting which console is running this backup manager.
5169979	5171641	It's going to be tough.
5172442	5173543	Well, we'll see what develops.
5174304	5178188	I'm kind of curious to see how Sony's long-term strategy of this plays out.
5178749	5183354	It's kind of like, yeah, they can try and stop this with the court orders and everything, but once the technology is out there, it's out there.
5183374	5186077	It's going to be very hard to stop, especially when they're telling people how to make their own.
5186417	5190318	And they're already starting to dump games too.
5190478	5197440	So the whole scene now because the hard drives, you don't even really have to do too much.
5197480	5199981	You just can copy the file straight to your hard drive.
5202102	5204022	People are just doing Blu-ray dumps.
5204262	5210944	Would Spazinator be able to use this to get his videos to work when Sony keeps screwing them over with the whole new console and all that?
5211065	5211565	I don't know.
5211925	5212225	I mean...
5213045	5213425	I don't know.
5214066	5215387	Alright, let's see.
5215527	5218329	Breakman in our chat room says, so people hacked a Sony system?
5218369	5219830	Isn't that business as usual with Sony?
5220270	5221031	Not for the PS3.
5221511	5222472	Yeah, not for the PS3.
5222692	5231137	I mean, they really kind of rolled this out as unhackable and for a while it certainly seemed that way, although we all knew in the back of our heads somebody would hack it eventually.
5231738	5232919	So it's finally coming around.
5232959	5240484	But with the fact that Blu-ray hasn't really been easily adopted into burning and all that yet, it's still got a ways to go, I think, before you're going to see like, you know,
5241624	5243226	mass market piracy for this.
5244447	5245007	Yeah, I don't know.
5245027	5249111	But they keep claiming piracy killed the PSP, but I don't know.
5249271	5250432	I have mixed feelings on that.
5250492	5251412	I don't think it's totally right.
5251432	5255956	It's a good scapegoat because they don't really, it's hard to tell what the numbers are actually on that.
5257537	5261881	But, I mean, I'm sure it contributed to it, but then again, look at the Nintendo DS.
5261961	5270568	I mean, that system is doing really well, and I don't, I mean, I know piracy has affected that, but it's hard to say, and
5272580	5272940	I don't know.
5273120	5274901	It'll be interesting to see what happens.
5277242	5278883	But I don't know.
5279023	5280484	It'll just be fun to play around with, I think.
5281845	5282145	All right.
5283285	5291509	Well, let's move on to another story about the Xbox 360 this time and some price changes going on on the 360.
5292170	5293730	This was news that came out this week.
5294771	5298333	A one-month gold subscription to Xbox Live is going up.
5299301	5301283	Starting November 1st, $8 to $10.
5303345	5304726	Three months, going up from $20 to $25.
5304766	5306488	And a full year of Xbox Live, up $50 to $60.
5306588	5308750	Of course, that's really $49.99 to $59.
5308790	5309150	It's $50 to $60.
5318067	5321812	The price of Xbox Live has gone up, folks.
5321952	5328341	But what's interesting about this story, it's the first time we've ever had this story in the history of our show, which has been going about as long as Xbox Live has.
5328762	5332046	They haven't raised the price in the years that it's been active.
5332547	5334389	Is it justified that they raise the price now?
5335190	5335731	What do you guys think?
5337001	5338922	I kind of thought it was about time.
5339862	5352346	I mean, you gotta keep up with the market and if you're not making enough to match cost and still have the right profit margin they're expecting, then I don't see why not.
5353140	5376902	by the way if you're worried about this price increase there are some ways you can lock in the old price you can do a renewal of one year through xbox.com right now for 40 bucks or you can also buy some of those prepaid cards right now with the lower prices because you know you can still find those for the old prices and if you load up on a couple of those then you'll be locked in for however much time and dude it's seriously like 80 some cents more a month
5378328	5379829	I mean, that's what it is averaged out.
5380009	5381730	And honestly, $10 more?
5382171	5384232	Yeah, that is more money for you to pay.
5384292	5389715	But, I mean, look at what the hell download content in your Xbox Live Arcade games cost that much.
5389755	5393198	And I understand that everybody's cash strapped nowadays with the economy and everything.
5393718	5394679	But come on!
5395279	5397740	Take... Eat one less lunch out or something.
5397900	5399740	I mean, stop fucking bitching about $10.
5400540	5401841	It's not like the price is doubling.
5402361	5404481	And I understand that you may not use all the features.
5404581	5408822	Because honestly, I don't use most of the features on Xbox Live.
5408922	5409602	I don't use Twitter.
5409642	5410783	I don't use Facebook.
5411283	5412743	You know, none of the extra stuff.
5412783	5414844	You know, the ESPN streaming and stuff like that.
5415004	5416164	I could care less about it.
5416604	5420085	And the fact that it's going up $10, it doesn't really bother me because...
5421105	5449671	you know so what well speaking of ESPN in our chat room Blaze says given that this ESPN functionality is supposed to be absurdly amazing then it's not that big a deal Breakman says fuck you Microsoft everyone kept asking them when Xbox Live will go free so they said fuck you we'll raise the price I'm okay with this price hike because they haven't done one in so long and it does seem like you know the amount of content on Xbox Live there's a lot of it there I'm okay with it you know because we're talking on a yearly basis too
5451175	5456537	If this is where we're going instead of the online pass, I'm okay with it.
5456938	5459118	But unfortunately, I think we all know it's not.
5459419	5461079	That online pass still exists.
5461159	5464301	And to me, you can't do this and that.
5465981	5470323	This online pass is ridiculous in the first place, but it's even more so with this.
5470523	5473184	I don't blame Microsoft for the online pass stuff.
5473405	5475666	I blame the third-party publishers for that.
5475686	5476626	Microsoft could stop it.
5478502	5480083	It's their servers, their store.
5480103	5480823	They can stop.
5480963	5481944	It's their software, though.
5481984	5485645	If they want to prevent people from connecting online, they can do that.
5487066	5487966	It's their software.
5488026	5498611	I understand that they should step up and say, hey, you shouldn't be doing this kind of stuff on our service because they made everybody play nice with the guitar controllers and stuff like that.
5498651	5499771	They all had to work together.
5501492	5502653	That was kind of cool, but...
5503753	5504213	Thanks for watching!
5519378	5546723	like if Microsoft said oh by the way we're going to charge you $10 to play this game online or I'm sorry Microsoft said no we're going to charge you $10 extra to play this game online if you buy it used then there might be some issues but I don't think they're going to go that route because they're making enough money as it is on live and maybe they try supporting it with ad revenue and stuff like that and maybe it's just the cost to run this stuff keeps going up and up I mean they keep adding you know
5548559	5550200	Features and stuff to it.
5551520	5552820	Maybe it's just getting more expensive.
5552940	5554241	I don't know.
5554861	5560462	I really do feel the value of $50 for Xbox Live now is certainly better than it was 8 years ago.
5560743	5562183	Which is cool.
5562383	5566704	I don't think that they would just say, we want to make more money so we're going to raise the price.
5566864	5574746	I think that they would actually say, because they're going to try to keep it as low as possible to stay competitive with the PlayStation Network.
5575527	5575667	And
5576667	5580732	I don't see them raising prices just because, oh, we need to make more money.
5581112	5584056	I think it's just that the cost of doing things is going up.
5584616	5597411	Blaze said, remember that this online pass stuff applies to games that are multi-console, and Microsoft requires an online play go through their servers, but Sony makes third-party people run their own servers.
5598757	5604078	Well, okay, but still, then put the online pass on Sony, not Microsoft.
5604098	5607379	Seriously, though... Stop being lazy and just putting out the same code for both systems.
5607399	5615581	If people are that pissed off about a $10 price hike, then you need to spend the extra effort it's going to take to go and find those cards for cheaper.
5615942	5617002	And honestly, they're...
5617842	5618983	There are cards out there.
5619023	5621885	There's a lot of ways to get cards for like 40 bucks now.
5622445	5624807	I mean, go stock up on some of those.
5624867	5636915	If you're so concerned about spending the extra 83 cents a month, I mean, seriously, go for a walk around your local strip malls and stuff like that.
5636955	5639177	You could probably find 83 cents on the ground.
5639677	5641899	I mean, it's not that fucking expensive.
5642099	5644721	Seriously, go without a can of soda one week, you know?
5645781	5646902	I mean, 83 cents a month.
5646922	5647963	Let's break that down by week.
5648004	5652168	That's like 20 cents a week.
5652548	5653609	I mean, come on.
5653769	5654510	Find a dime.
5654650	5658474	I understand that it's not that much money, but here you go, you devil's advocate.
5658694	5659975	It's the principle.
5660456	5664700	They're raising the price, and what are they doing to justify the raising of the price?
5665168	5669153	Well, people aren't too worried about paying $60 for games.
5669653	5676381	That's a $10 price hike per game, so why aren't you just still playing your original PlayStation 2 and Xbox then?
5676681	5682448	Why aren't you boycotting all these different game systems since it's so expensive for you to spend the extra $10?
5683389	5685571	I think you're a fucking hypocrite is what I think you are.
5686809	5691573	Breakman in our chatroom says, I'll pay Microsoft an extra $10 a month to take Facebook off my 360.
5693075	5693615	Amen to that.
5693675	5695417	Facebook on 360 is ugly.
5695517	5698119	Like, it looks better on a cell phone, and that is saying a lot.
5699381	5699661	All right.
5700001	5703464	Anyhow, let's move on and get into the classic video game of the week.
5703524	5711091	It's a chance for us to take a trip down memory lane where DarkSakura will dig into the gamer vault and find a game that she thinks, hey...
5711872	5714194	You kids out there in internet land.
5714335	5715876	Get off my lawn and play this game.
5715916	5718298	Get off my lawn and go inside and play this game.
5718779	5721862	DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?
5722623	5724004	X-Men for the Sega Genesis.
5725846	5727187	Aw, not this little player arcade.
5728768	5730290	I have to save something for the future, Rob.
5730430	5731952	Anyway, um...
5733092	5735858	Probably, I think, one of the best games that came on the Genesis.
5736259	5738805	It was in 1993, and it was the whole 90s era of X-Men.
5745087	5757841	and the game basically starts off where you're in the danger room and there's a virus that goes into the danger room so you have to go through different areas within the danger room and then fight Magneto at the end.
5758341	5763787	So you play as Gambit or Nightcrawler, Wolverine or Cyclops and they have...
5765735	5766856	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
5784635	5790401	So yeah, with Wolverine, he basically has his big bad claws and his healing factor.
5792143	5795287	Gambit has his charged cards for a special attack.
5795908	5797529	Cyclops has the optic blast.
5797870	5801174	And Nightcrawler has the ability to teleport, which is useful.
5801234	5802916	He was actually my favorite character to use in the game.
5803576	5811744	You also get Storm, Rogue, Iceman, and Archangel as sort of helpers.
5811864	5812985	You can call on them for help.
5813926	5816769	And you can also get Jean Grey to pop up if you happen to fall.
5817670	5819812	And you fight different X-Men villains, so it's pretty cool.
5819952	5824657	But one of the cool things about this game, and it had a... It broke the fourth wall, Bob.
5826457	5826737	You know?
5827818	5835322	It, um... When you defeat Mojo, you have to reset the computer in the Danger Room, but what it really means is reset your machine.
5836503	5845308	And the whole trick is that you just sort of have to pop the reset button, and then it'll black out and pop up these numbers like a computer rebooting, you know, in the 90s.
5845748	5847349	So what, somebody's 486, I guess?
5848529	5848790	Anyway.
5850070	5854253	Um... But, uh, we had a giggle from Loki about something...
5855313	5858176	Something with someone posing.
5859177	5859877	I'm curious now.
5861719	5866083	Can we wait until after the classic game?
5866163	5871527	One thing that I need to point out is that if you hit the button too hard, of course, it will reset the game and you're like SOL.
5872288	5879694	Or if you have a Nomad, the Nomad doesn't have a reset button, so you're SOL there unless you level skip.
5880875	5898782	Um, all of the music in the game was done by Fletcher Beasley, who used the Genesis emulation music software, and it would work with the Yamaha 2612 FM synthesizer chip on the Genesis, so you could play the sounds back through it and you'd know what it sounded like.
5898822	5900422	So it's actually got a really cool soundtrack.
5900562	5902083	I think that it sounds really good.
5903263	5903343	Um...
5905024	5912626	But he's quoted as saying that he was trying to use the sound of the distorted guitar in his tracks to make them sound edgier.
5913447	5915167	And I mean, it's got a great soundtrack.
5915607	5916228	Kudos to him.
5917108	5918108	But it was a really cool game.
5918268	5923930	It actually, there's one level in that game that pissed me off to no end and it was always the Mojo World level.
5924550	5925290	Hated it.
5926771	5927091	I'm done.
5929812	5930592	That's fighting mode.
5931952	5932873	Mojo Jojo.
5933573	5934013	Just kidding.
5935965	5941028	Alright, there you go, your classic game of the week is X-Men on the Genesis.
5941989	5942689	Good times.
5943469	5944630	Thank you very much, DarkSakura.
5945210	5949273	Good pick, even if I'm more of a fan of the arcade one, but that's okay.
5950373	5951694	Okay, Loki, why are you giggling?
5952114	5958178	Oh, nothing, there was someone who was pointing out, actually one of our listeners, they were pointing out that
5958898	5962643	Have you heard that... Have you seen the story about Earth Defense Force?
5962843	5964685	A new Earth Defense Force game coming out next year.
5965245	5967308	And I actually clicked on the link to check it out.
5967908	5977359	And then it links the Structoid article that links also a CheapAssGamer article where I'm the source of that news information.
5977579	5977920	Nice.
5978080	5978480	It's like...
5979381	5980121	Yeah, I heard about it.
5980761	5981562	Actually, I'm looking at this.
5981602	5983682	This was just, what's today, the 5th?
5984322	5985963	This was like four hours ago.
5986403	5990604	Yeah, the GameStop conference, I think they had an actual logo for it.
5990624	5999647	And if you go to edfia.com, you can check out, they have the placeholder logo for Earth Defense Force Insect Armageddon.
6000347	6004569	Orange Launch Radio Podcast co-host Loki has recently uncovered a sequel to the B-movie quality Earth Defense Force 2017.
6017997	6020359	If this news is correct, then all is well with the world.
6020399	6023120	The game falls under the same category as Deadly Premonition for me.
6023520	6030764	According to his information, Earth Defense Force 2017 Insect Armageddon for the Xbox 360 is being released sometime in February 2011 by D3 Publisher.
6031105	6036248	Loki, who works for a game distributor and has a strong track record on things such as unannounced games, tweeted the following.
6036608	6042851	Just saw this on my release list from D3 Earth Defense Force 2017 Insect Armageddon coming February on Xbox 360.
6042911	6043972	Dude, wasn't that like a month ago?
6044232	6045973	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6070413	6070673	Oops!
6071613	6076655	I don't want D3 being pissed off at me because then that comes back to me and then I lose my job.
6076675	6078396	That's why you gotta stop putting on Twitter.
6078416	6083177	You have to do it here on the show in Secret Club where these people don't listen.
6083517	6087519	I'm a crazy person that says these things, okay?
6087739	6093181	It's just meant for sharing with the listeners, not to be as posted as a story.
6095442	6104072	It's so when Joystick picks this article up, say four months from now, and they're like, hey, we just discovered that blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
6104172	6107175	And then it'd be like, hey, I knew about that months ago.
6107695	6109157	Good job.
6109998	6112541	It's just so you can realize that we knew it first.
6113121	6115983	They better not be mad at you because you know what?
6116003	6117944	You've been supporting this game from the beginning.
6117964	6118945	It is so awesome.
6119065	6119465	I am so excited.
6119485	6121767	You probably helped this sequel happen, honestly.
6121967	6123468	I don't know anyone who talks about this with you.
6123488	6123948	It is so awesome.
6123968	6126009	I own four copies of this game, okay?
6127030	6128151	And you know why I did that?
6128351	6131012	Just in case ever one of my discs breaks.
6131112	6132073	Which one of them has?
6132253	6133494	Because I played it so much.
6134695	6136596	So I had three backup copies I bought.
6136996	6139238	We were clearing them out of our warehouse for five bucks each.
6139258	6140578	I'm like, I'm taking all of those.
6141739	6144641	So, yeah, I love this game.
6145121	6147383	And I fully support the sequel.
6147443	6149304	And I hope to God it has four-player co-op.
6149444	6150065	Can I borrow one?
6150685	6152226	I actually looked for the game.
6152667	6153727	I wasn't able to find it.
6153747	6154288	Yeah, sure.
6154528	6154788	All right.
6155268	6156749	But, yeah, lesson learned here.
6156889	6157250	Stop.
6157910	6159551	Posting Loki's stuff.
6160271	6160972	No, I don't care.
6161272	6161672	It doesn't.
6162633	6162973	I don't.
6163233	6165275	I mean, they would have said something by now.
6165935	6166896	Yeah, it's true.
6166976	6168036	It was out there a month ago.
6168336	6171778	And honestly, I mean, it's... The official logo showed up now.
6171798	6175241	They have the official websites up and the GameStop conference.
6175301	6176081	Someone took a picture.
6176101	6177302	It says, Earth Defense Force returns 2011.
6177342	6178282	So there you go.
6178342	6179603	They have a banner for it.
6179843	6181304	It's happening.
6181564	6186087	Okay, so the story that went up four hours ago then is like behind because this has already been confirmed.
6186127	6187528	It's no longer a rumor.
6187668	6191951	Yeah, well, Destructoid, they ran their story 16 hours ago, apparently.
6192231	6197594	And they just picked up on... Neo games are fun, I guess.
6197654	6201577	They ran... This was posted yesterday.
6202457	6204839	So... I don't know.
6204859	6206160	People are just figuring it out now.
6207200	6208921	See, that's why you gotta read my stuff closely.
6209502	6209882	Because...
6212042	6217145	Well, Destructoid called D3 to get confirmation, so maybe you'll be in the office on Tuesday.
6217245	6217845	Who told you that?
6220606	6222167	Well, they referenced CheapAssGamer.
6224348	6229750	But they also have NeoGAF, though, right above that link, if you noticed.
6230710	6231251	Wait, you know what?
6231291	6234912	That's kind of fucked up, though, because it really wasn't CheapAssGamer.
6235072	6240495	It's somebody on a blog on CheapAssGamer who starts off by referencing you.
6242259	6245641	That really was not CheapAssGamer doing that at all.
6245741	6246662	It had nothing to do with that.
6246722	6247743	It was that user.
6248103	6250886	So either that user or you should have been credited.
6251927	6252487	I'm just saying.
6253007	6253428	A little bit.
6253708	6255169	I don't really care that I'm not credited.
6255329	6256691	I guess that's true.
6256771	6259153	It's Blueswim, which I believe is one of our listeners.
6259173	6260013	Yeah, I've heard that name before.
6260053	6262415	It's one of our listeners.
6262455	6262816	I get it.
6262836	6266819	That website does little personal blog things and he's excited about this game like you are.
6267720	6268080	As he should.
6268080	6268881	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6289705	6290145	I don't know.
6290566	6291146	It's stupid.
6291646	6291966	Alright.
6292487	6293007	We're over it.
6293027	6293427	Let's get past this.
6293447	6293867	I'm over it.
6293907	6294808	Yeah, let's get past this.
6295228	6296029	It's just kind of funny.
6296169	6298270	I am going to beg them, though, for a copy of that game.
6298670	6300471	You need to send that to me now!
6301292	6302452	Alright, we're going to take a break.
6302552	6304413	We'll be right back with more of Orange Launch Radio.
6304714	6305914	Tonight's the marathon, folks.
6306014	6306995	We're about...
6307415	6308496	Almost two hours in already.
6308956	6310457	And we've got plenty more show to come.
6310957	6312218	We still have the main show.
6312318	6327368	We are going to do Twitter topics, rapid fire stories, some news about the iPod Touch we're going to get into, some iPod related news, Xbox Live Arcade, price drop for the DSi, the mailbags, the FUs, all that good stuff when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
6327908	6329629	And we are going to be taking a music break here.
6329869	6331890	I'm going to be editing the podcast a little differently.
6332210	6334371	It's just going to kind of jump skip into the next segment.
6334411	6337972	So I apologize for the sloppy editing, but we can't play the copyrighted music on the podcast.
6338593	6340854	We are going to take a quick break though here in studio.
6342414	6343315	We'll do some music.
6343355	6351638	By the way, today's break music is like all music that we used to play on OLR when we were an actual station back in what, like 2002, 2003?
6351698	6351818	Yeah.
6353839	6360095	because we're awesome that way yes so we'll be right back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio don't go anywhere about five minutes marathon continues
6366004	6366544	Orange Lounge Radio
6387122	6387983	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6409199	6410901	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6427518	6431220	So Twitter topics, if you're hearing my voice and you want to get some Twitter topics in, send those in.
6431681	6434282	Meanwhile, Loki, what do you got for us?
6434402	6442187	Oh, hey, on Twitter topics, guys, try to refrain from just linking us to news stories because we have a lot coming up later in the marathon, too.
6442287	6445809	Not that we don't appreciate that, but we probably are covering it at some point.
6446650	6451853	But if you have good questions or feedback on an earlier story or something, that's definitely what we're looking for tonight.
6452293	6454635	Alright, so let's get into some rapid-fire news, Loki.
6455415	6459238	There was an Easter egg discovered from Wave Race Blue Storm.
6459818	6461099	Yes, that old game.
6461559	6465562	They actually just found a... What was it?
6465962	6471846	It's an Easter egg that kind of changes some of the announcer audio in the game.
6471926	6477750	He starts berating you, and then also, for some reason, when you do your boost, it goes, which is...
6479091	6481797	I'm sure Irene would get a kick out of that.
6482398	6485464	But yeah, it's interesting though.
6485864	6490012	Apparently it's just a key press that you do on one of the options screens.
6492656	6498900	It's funny that games, even though they're out that long, that some Easter eggs haven't been discovered yet.
6499201	6504464	I remember there was one a couple weeks ago about a Splinter Cell game.
6505004	6516212	They actually had it where there was a secret mission where you had to recover or had to find all these space seals that were hidden in the game.
6516632	6520234	It was a special save the seals mission, which is kind of weird.
6521715	6527299	There is a game from Activision called Blood Drive.
6528260	6531422	I guess the information has been leaked out from the BBFC.
6532703	6533723	I also saw it on their list.
6535465	6538166	And it is going to be a combat racing game.
6539347	6547673	I guess the marketing shill, as they put it, is Shaun of the Dead meets Mad Max in Death Race.
6548153	6551095	So basically a game that's cheesy and very gory.
6551595	6552296	That sounds like fun.
6552416	6553337	Yeah, it sounds awesome.
6553677	6557280	And it is somewhat budget priced.
6557380	6558421	It's $50 retail.
6559182	6561123	And it'll be coming out in November.
6561884	6564146	So that would be cool.
6564226	6566268	I'm down for combat racing games.
6566388	6569030	And cheesy is good, as long as it's a good game.
6569911	6573674	Not necessarily a terrible driving game.
6573954	6574674	Thanks for watching!
6595041	6603089	But anyways, in case you're still curious about it, it is a port of a German Wii game developed by Sproing.
6604010	6613739	And I guess you'll practice 20 unique choreographies and dance your way from the street stage all the way to the TV studio.
6614439	6618383	Under the watchful eye of Detlef D. Soest.
6620965	6621646	Some douche.
6622166	6628672	Who is basically some German dancer, choreographer.
6629272	6629993	Like I said.
6631774	6636578	Honestly, like I said before, it's a terrible game.
6636738	6638880	It's just, it doesn't play very well.
6640021	6645205	And if you look at the screenshots that they have of it, it's got this really weird...
6648051	6657576	Not like a note highway or something, but it's sort of like DDR where they've got arrows coming down the screen, but it's two different rows of arrows, as you can see right here.
6658217	6665841	And you have to kind of move your controllers in different directions to match the different analog sticks.
6666081	6669803	And while that might be cool and stuff to do on, like, say...
6671805	6673107	You know, a dance pad or something.
6673527	6680136	It's really awkward on the controller, especially since one side doesn't correspond to certain directions.
6680216	6681698	It's just mixed all over the place.
6682439	6685243	And, uh... The music's terrible, so...
6686024	6686704	Don't buy it.
6687024	6688605	Instead, you need to buy some other games.
6689245	6691465	I think Plants vs. Zombies might be this week.
6692546	6692966	Check that out.
6693706	6705249	Then, of course, the new iPod Touch with iOS 4, the Retina display, and Game Center has been revealed at the new Apple event that was this week.
6706149	6712233	is available in an 8GB model for $229, 32GB for $299, and a 64GB model for $399.
6712574	6726283	It is coming out next week, and it basically has all the wonderful features of the new iPhone 4, except, of course, no GPS, no phone, and much cheaper, I think.
6727043	6729485	But, yeah, I will be picking one of those up myself.
6729745	6739589	Also, some of the other stuff that they announced at the event, of course, the new Apple TV for $99, which is kind of cool, I guess, if you're into that.
6740149	6749052	And then something else that was kind of cool, one of the things that they're really kind of pushing that the iPhone and iPod is like a gaming platform.
6749492	6755956	Project Sword, which is a game that's running on the Unreal 3 engine and is coming out from Epic.
6756196	6757917	And it actually looks pretty good.
6758277	6762740	So it is a sword fighting game that is focused on one-on-one battles.
6762880	6768684	So kind of like... Oh, there's some Wii game that came out that's kind of similar to that.
6769224	6770905	Hopefully not like the Castlevania fighting game.
6771385	6771566	But...
6772626	6778876	Looks pretty good, and it's kind of amazing to see that they have ported the Unreal 3 engine to iOS.
6780058	6780278	Neat.
6781300	6781520	Neat.
6782542	6782822	All right.
6784605	6787810	Now, Alan, you were telling me about something earlier that you'd seen about this whole mess, right?
6788383	6799006	I've been reading on Joystick and Kotaku about a free tech demo that Epic released this week called Epic Citadel for the iPhone 4 and also for the new iPod Touches that are coming out.
6799726	6803748	It's basically the engine that this sword game is going to be running on.
6804308	6806849	It's pretty much just you and the touch interface in a town.
6808209	6810850	and all you can do is really just walk around and look at stuff.
6810930	6818253	But the graphics, I guess, the way they ported the Unreal Engine into the phone is so good that you just can't believe that you're getting this on an iPhone.
6818893	6822754	And the videos for it, for those that want to look it up on Google, it's called Epic Citadel.
6822814	6824055	It's free on the App Store.
6824895	6827177	So whoever has a new iPhone can download it and check it out.
6827217	6828138	It's supposed to be amazing.
6828278	6828998	I'm downloading it right now.
6829038	6835123	You know what's really sad is all they would really have to do now with the iPhone to really kind of compete in the market.
6835183	6839327	Well, I mean, they already are competing in the market with like the Nintendo DS and the PSP, but they're really kind of...
6839867	6841648	Well, they came out at the conference.
6841668	6847991	They took a shot at Nintendo and Sony and said that they've sold more than those two combined, although it's fuzzy math.
6848071	6849072	Yeah, I understand.
6849092	6849912	All right, I'm downloading it.
6849952	6862159	But to basically kind of deliver that finishing blow, if you would put it, if they added some sort of actual buttons, some sort of controller interface to that, it would be – I mean, how are you going to compete with that?
6862199	6864660	I mean, now you've got a platform that's very popular.
6864720	6865821	The apps are really cheap.
6866381	6893745	and the games are actually getting to be on par if not better than some of the stuff that's on the PSP and on the DS yeah it really is the one thing the iPhone, iTouch, whatever is missing is a tangible controller I mean if they could have that it would be amazing when you were playing Sonic 2 on the iPhone 4 at the Apple store they had to bring the screen in a little bit to like a little thumbnail so that it could put a little digital D-pad and buttons on there and it really affected the gameplay
6894335	6894995	Yeah, I sure did.
6897117	6897457	We'll see.
6897517	6903320	An AlphaCanadagram in our chatroom at chat.orangeandre.com agrees, seriously, Apple just needs to make a controller shell for it.
6903901	6904141	K.O.
6904181	6908063	Ray in our chatroom says, yes, Epic Citadel is all eye candy and it looks sweet.
6908223	6908744	Here's something.
6909584	6912446	I mean, we've kind of thrown this idea out for a while now.
6913647	6915628	You know, what if Apple made a gaming console?
6915668	6917829	Well, what if they did?
6917929	6919850	I mean, the Apple TV's down to $99.
6920071	6923853	Who's to say they can't come up with some sort of wireless Bluetooth controller or something that
6924173	6926255	All they have to do is put iOS on that box.
6926395	6929438	Yeah, iOS on the box to make it a wireless controller.
6929478	6933001	Maybe a little bit more powerful, kind of like an iPhone or something like that.
6934723	6936224	Then now your games are really cheap.
6936264	6939768	It's all digital, but make a portable system.
6940008	6940468	They're going to...
6941409	6948855	Sony better step up, because seriously, right now they're really slacking as far as their system goes, and they're going to lose it really quick.
6950316	6950656	We'll see.
6951016	6955760	Alright, well speaking of the iPhone, Mirror's Edge and Puzzle Agent also came out on the iPhone.
6955780	6957201	Those were releases earlier this week.
6957942	6961705	Mirror's Edge was already out on the iPad, but now it's on the iPhone.
6961945	6966088	On the iPad it was $10, and now it's only going to be $5 on the iPhone.
6966908	6970571	Telltale is trying out a game release on iPhone.
6970611	6971612	It's Puzzle Agent.
6971932	6973914	You might remember this came out on PCs a little bit ago.
6974695	6979038	That is where Telltale games are about approximately on the other iDevices.
6979478	6985163	So yeah, they're on the App Store and check those out if you are interested in either of those series.
6985903	6995992	Otherwise, going back to the more traditional consoles, on the Xbox Live Arcade, King of Fighters Sky Stage is supposed to be hitting the Japanese Xbox Live Arcade on September 15th.
6996432	7001196	It's going to be costing $10, 800 Microsoft points or whatever that converts to in yen.
7002177	7007142	And that is the one, by the way, where Terry Bogard and Mai are like shooters.
7007782	7009383	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7032043	7054055	It's kind of interesting that Disney's doing this twice Because Epic Mickey has a collector's edition too But with Tron Evolution For PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 There will be the collector's edition It comes with a toy model light cycle From Sideshow Collectibles A display case for it With a drawer to keep the game in It's $130 So you're paying an extra $70 for this figurine But I gotta say
7057817	7059738	That's a sweet looking figurine.
7059838	7063240	It's like a little light bike from the new movie.
7063260	7066301	If it actually lit up, I might have to do it.
7067381	7068282	No word on that yet.
7068442	7072624	I would just wait and see because they're going to have collectible toys and stuff I'm sure when the Tron stuff comes out.
7072724	7076745	You could probably buy one standalone that would be a lot cooler than that.
7079426	7080827	Those collector's editions, man.
7080867	7082287	Sometimes it's a real waste of money.
7082508	7088390	However, you know the Black Ops one that they have coming out now with that little car that has a camera on it and stuff?
7088730	7092111	Those things are actually out now as some other device.
7093131	7102074	But they're really popular in the hacking community because they're so easy to modify to do a bunch of different things like installing Linux and crap on it and stuff.
7102114	7104075	So it might be a good buy to actually get that.
7104515	7110241	or if you're smart, you'll just go buy the actual toy that's out now instead of spending the extra money.
7111915	7116658	Tron is awesome, but any game that's a movie tie-in, eh, not sure if wants.
7116738	7117999	I don't know, this game looks pretty awesome.
7118019	7123663	I gotta say, I played it at E3 and it was kinda cool because it was like Prince of Persia, but with Tron graphics.
7123783	7127846	And like, apparently it's heavily influenced with Capoeira, like all the fighting is based on Capoeira.
7128226	7129767	I gotta say, it was kinda rad.
7130047	7136312	But Shane was watching me play it, and you know, Shane didn't really see Tron as a kid because I think he was like born the year it came out or something.
7137473	7139394	So, like, I know, right?
7139794	7140835	So, I think like,
7141215	7142256	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7161114	7166557	But, uh, they have it where, um, you know, the main guy, cause it kinda reminds me a lot of, like, The Force Unleashed, almost.
7167237	7187528	Um, you know, he's chasing after these guys on light cycles and stuff, and, um, one of the, uh, recognizers, and, you know, he's chasing after them, and all of a sudden, you know, he kills one of them with the disc on the actual light cycle, and then, uh, they start shooting at him, he jumps up, uh, like, runs along the wall, and then transforms back into the light cycle again.
7187548	7188949	It's just fuckin' sweet.
7190089	7197634	I gotta admit, I've been to the movies a couple times lately, and that trailer usually plays, and every time they show the trailer for the new Tron movie, I get a little stiffy.
7199475	7200276	It looks awesome.
7200356	7205199	We need to see that in 3D, IMAX, and with those D-Box motion seats.
7205600	7207021	Just do the full shebang.
7207101	7216487	As soon as those tickets go on sale, I'm almost wanting to go to LA just to see it at the official Disney theater, because I'm that crazy excited.
7217133	7218494	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7236347	7238388	It's a Tron world after all
7265820	7268642	and, uh, yeah, it's gonna be this huge event that starts October 8th.
7268662	7269722	It better have all the games in there.
7270363	7271604	And this is what pisses me off.
7271644	7274125	That's a week after I'm gonna be there anyway for Gay Days.
7274845	7275826	So mad.
7276066	7276386	Bitches.
7276987	7277987	But, that means I have to go back.
7278888	7279328	Let's go.
7279388	7282710	So it's October 8th until, I think, we need to go.
7282890	7284231	Like, are we that crazy?
7284311	7284531	Yes.
7284591	7284811	Yes.
7285031	7285372	We're going.
7286132	7294037	So there'll be no show the week the Tron movie comes out because DarkSakura and I are gonna go see it at the official 3D Disney theater in Anaheim.
7295054	7296395	Yes, yes we are.
7298395	7301697	Wow, we're going to travel across country to see a movie in a theater.
7301917	7305718	Yes, we're worse than the Twilight fans in some regards.
7305758	7309820	If only we could do that here and see a movie in a theater.
7311801	7319504	But you don't understand because then when it's over, we can go to the electronica party and then we can ride Space Mountain a million times.
7319544	7322385	They should actually redo Space Mountain as Tron Mountain for the movie.
7322685	7330501	Well, there's a rumor that if the Tron thing is really successful and the movie does really well, that the Tomorrowland arcade is going to permanently be Flynn's arcade.
7331585	7334047	That will make me completely giddy.
7335048	7336328	I think that's the way it should be too.
7336348	7341512	I hope that the reproduction Flins that they do is going to have all the old games and everything too.
7342132	7342773	I don't care.
7343353	7347536	Apparently it's the same Flins Arcade that's been at Comic Con and some of that stuff.
7347556	7348937	It's been traveling around a little bit.
7349537	7351559	I don't care if this new Tron movie is terrible.
7351999	7359164	You all need to satisfy what I've built it up in my mind of seeing this as a child and you all need to go see this movie opening day so it does well.
7359344	7362185	and dude, it's Flynn's the bad guy.
7362886	7363686	At least I think he is.
7364266	7364786	Or is he?
7365507	7366547	It might be a clone.
7367487	7368888	It's Clue's the bad guy.
7369488	7369808	Anyway.
7371857	7372718	I'm so excited.
7373158	7376221	Takeo Reyes in our chatroom saying, oh, the marathon's affecting Sky already.
7376542	7378163	Stiffies, crazy trips to Disneyland.
7378724	7379885	It's over.
7379905	7382207	Chat.orangeonstrater.com Let's see.
7382267	7382868	Breakman.
7382928	7384970	Disney's gonna make a live nerd dance party?
7385531	7386211	Yes, they are.
7386732	7387713	Nerd dance party.
7387733	7390616	And you know if DarkSakura and I are gonna be there, it's an extra nerd dance party.
7391016	7393978	We need to figure out what day that is and announce our arrival well in advance.
7393998	7395278	We need sparkly silver clothes.
7395359	7397500	Because we need to get some of our LA peeps to gum.
7397520	7401202	We need Marissa to shake her boobies at this.
7401542	7406445	We need DJ Tyrant to show up and write a story for the website once every six months or so.
7406765	7408666	Disneyland friends, people who work there.
7409126	7409326	Yes.
7409367	7409887	We love you.
7410107	7413449	Yeah, we need our cast member friends that work there to show up.
7414550	7417092	I know we have other LA listeners, so we're going to figure out what day this is.
7417692	7419413	And the minute tickets go on sale, we've got to get them.
7419954	7420854	Okay, we're doing this.
7421235	7422255	Oh my god, I'm so excited.
7422536	7424077	Maybe Scott can come with you.
7424617	7425278	Scott's in LA?
7425658	7425858	Yeah.
7425998	7426418	There we go.
7427579	7432523	Of course, I'm making all these plans while Dan's in the other room probably going, the fuck she is.
7435185	7437327	Dan, we're going to go see Tron at Disneyland, okay?
7439606	7441507	He said we have it on air.
7441747	7442508	I'll take Dan.
7442688	7443168	I'll take it.
7443408	7444208	Put Dan in the car.
7444489	7445429	Dan's coming with us.
7446590	7447110	I don't care.
7447330	7447890	We ain't working.
7448451	7448831	All right.
7450392	7454474	Anyhow, Spazinator in chat says Sky will try to get Loki to build him a real light cycle.
7454554	7454994	I just might.
7455674	7455954	All right.
7456054	7457375	I don't know how to build motorcycles.
7458055	7459196	Well, you better learn real quick.
7459356	7459636	All right.
7460617	7462177	Let's move on with some other quick stories.
7462217	7463198	That was supposed to be a quick story.
7463218	7464359	It ended up taking like 15 minutes.
7464399	7465099	Dark Sakura.
7465982	7468164	Namco is remaking Arcade Classics.
7469105	7481655	Actually, coming out for Wii is going to be Namco Museum Megamix, which has different remixed games, like the Galaga Remix, the Pac-Man Rail Shooter thing.
7482836	7490862	There's also going to be, though, an old-school game called Grobda Remix, which is a shmup-y game, so yay.
7491003	7493985	Also, of course, Pac-Man, Mappy, Rally-X, Galaga, blah, blah, blah.
7495473	7499655	and then for Sims 3 fans like myself, Barnacle Bay!
7500135	7501856	They're getting on the big pirate bandwagon.
7502316	7503937	And you know what my theory about this is?
7504797	7518144	They're putting out downloadable content so that you can have you know like it's a whole town of piratey goodness but I think they're really getting the inspiration from all these players that have made their own pirate stuff.
7519304	7521205	So they're just like, oh we'll do it too.
7522306	7524627	So anyway it's going to be coming out.
7524867	7526388	Can you make Johnny Depp walk the plank?
7526848	7527208	I wish.
7528549	7534633	And then for people who may be a little bit pissed off with Xbox in September, there's Halo freebies.
7535153	7535953	Yay.
7536434	7543498	So with the launch of Halo Reach, it's going to be the 14th through 20th will be Invasion Week.
7544398	7547460	And you get new gear, exciting content.
7547540	7547860	Help!
7547900	7549141	Microsoft's invading my wallet!
7549161	7550221	Spectacular prizes!
7550861	7554122	And a chance to play with creators of the game, and that was a quote.
7554762	7566246	Also, Xbox Live Gold features to Silver members on September 17th through 20th, and anyone who gets online can download the Invasion theme.
7568747	7571328	I just see Master Chiefs running around in party hats.
7572728	7578291	Also, as well, Resident Evil 5 Avatar outfits and game add-ons will be discounted.
7578831	7592018	September 13th, Puzzle Games will be getting the DOTW deal, Best to Move Live, Puzzle Chronicles, Tower Blocks, Deluxer, knocked down to 400 Microsoft points, $5, and Gyromancer is going from $1,200 to $800.
7592058	7593739	And then Rock Band 3 Avatar stuff, and...
7602183	7608786	Also on the Marketplace is Bully Scholarship Edition and Cabela's African Safari, which isn't Africa.
7610046	7614308	Speaking of all this, are we allowed to talk about what Dan's playing in the front room right now?
7614588	7616129	Or is that like a no-no topic?
7616989	7617229	No-no?
7617909	7618350	Okay, no-no.
7618630	7618970	Never mind.
7619230	7621391	This is completely unrelated to what we were just talking about, I promise.
7623332	7625152	We can talk about it, but I don't know where he got it.
7625312	7626013	Me neither.
7626053	7626453	Me neither.
7628582	7629103	Oh, sweet.
7629383	7631625	Oh, we're getting more people committing to coming to the electronic.
7631665	7632586	Oh, this is going to be awesome.
7633226	7633486	All right.
7634047	7636209	Anyhow, let's move on.
7638170	7639732	Did you have a story you wanted to do, Loki?
7639952	7640432	Yeah, sure.
7640913	7641173	Oh, wait.
7641213	7642194	I got to do Twitter topics.
7642454	7642874	Oh, my gosh.
7642954	7643875	I don't want to forget the tweets.
7644195	7644976	Let's do Twitter topics.
7645156	7645456	Okay.
7646097	7647838	That'll give you a little more time to think about that story anyway.
7649299	7653161	Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to send us a tweet.
7654001	7656402	We only have a few tonight probably because I said don't send us links.
7656482	7660484	Also, I don't think I don't think Tigerclaw's in chat tonight.
7660824	7661544	Like, is he okay?
7663585	7666306	He probably went on vacation for Labor Day like most people do.
7667266	7668927	Every night I expect to see links from Tigerclaw.
7668947	7671188	They're not there tonight.
7671548	7673148	Do we need to send a search party to his home?
7673168	7675009	Because this is not typical.
7675449	7677230	But I think he's probably on a trip.
7678730	7679810	Let loose the hounds.
7680110	7680430	All right.
7681471	7681951	Let's move on.
7684351	7696353	Our good buddy Jay Jugo on Twitter is saying, Breakdown for the win by OLR because they're playing the old school music tonight from our old rotation, which is all the old Bomani music and so forth.
7697134	7704315	Maren Marvel, speaking of people we may or may not see at the Tron thing, is OLR Marathon Night a horrible night to have a curse?
7705478	7710882	Yes, what curse, what would be a bad curse to have during the, what would be a bad curse to have during the OLR marathon?
7711382	7712143	Glittery vampires.
7712303	7715065	Probably diarrhea would be a bad curse to have actually during this marathon.
7715085	7715826	So we better not get pizza.
7715866	7716926	Alright.
7721727	7723789	Let's see, more tweets here.
7724169	7725490	Leo Shen sends us a tweet.
7725970	7730794	BlazeBlue, Continuum Shift 2 announced for arcades and three new characters are on the way.
7731134	7735237	He does link us to the official website, and I don't think this is a story that even comes up later.
7735937	7744264	Now, the official website's all in Japanese, so I can't say a whole lot else with this, but for those of you guys that are fans of this series, you played this game, right, Alan?
7744284	7744444	Yeah.
7745580	7747001	I think Loki, you might have a little bit too.
7747302	7752526	I have the arcade version on my cabinet.
7752567	7753868	Did you have this in Gamefly one week?
7754148	7757191	Yeah, it was the very first game I got with Gamefly and I brought it over to your house.
7757771	7760374	So I guess there's a new one coming out, so that's pretty cool.
7761176	7768362	TKL Ray sends us a tweet Would y'all be interested in doing the Extra Life Marathon this year?
7768582	7779572	Donations go to your local CMN hospital, which if I'm not mistaking is Children's Miracle Network, I think I do remember these tweets from last year God, has it been a year already?
7779612	7789340	I guess so October 16th It depends Didn't we try to do this last year and something happened?
7790743	7791504	I think we did.
7791564	7792624	Yeah, it just didn't work out.
7792764	7793505	Something happened.
7793525	7794185	It didn't work out.
7795987	7801851	If we can't participate directly, we'll definitely donate at least, but we'll see.
7801911	7804793	I don't want to commit just yet, especially after doing a marathon tonight.
7806274	7810216	I don't know if we could do a full, full, full marathon, especially after having just done one tonight.
7810236	7812258	We should have waited, huh?
7812338	7812738	But we'll see.
7814241	7819205	Spazinator PSN tweets For those that have a PS3 and care, there's an episode of Campus PD on the PSN store that's temporarily free.
7834838	7836921	It's under TV shows and free.
7850020	7851581	This is what I watch early in the morning.
7851601	7852702	Drunken sorority chicks?
7853142	7865552	It's basically just cops on... There was an episode of that I watched that they were busting some guys for having pot in a frat house or something like that because they saw it through a window.
7865912	7868214	And so they came in and it was just a bunch of...
7869778	7874559	Hippie college kids complaining that you don't have the right to enter my premises, blah, blah, blah, blah.
7874579	7875460	But it's in plain sight.
7875500	7876380	We can see it right here.
7876420	7879861	Therefore, it gives us probable cause to enter your residence.
7879921	7882282	So shut the fuck up, Mr. Law Major.
7883702	7885123	Pot in a frat house?
7885243	7886323	You don't say.
7886343	7886703	I know.
7886723	7887223	Get out.
7887523	7888444	Get right out of town.
7888544	7889984	It was... No.
7891685	7892445	Oh my gosh.
7892810	7893210	DarkSakura.com
7910547	7915393	If you've watched Cops in Mardi Gras or whatever, they have that episode or whatever.
7915413	7922661	Ho Ho Ho, their special episodes with all the prostitutes that they're picking up and stuff.
7923082	7924323	Put your top back on, ma'am.
7924643	7924904	Ma'am.
7925885	7926986	Put your shirt back on, ma'am.
7928087	7928848	Come with me, ma'am.
7929729	7931031	If we had anything to drink tonight, ma'am.
7932441	7936782	Yeah, I mean, it's... Yeah, wonderful programming.
7936802	7939623	This is what they put... Can you believe COPS is still on?
7940203	7945925	Like, COPS started, like, when FOX Network started in, like, 87, and it is still on.
7946005	7948146	Well, that America's Most Wanted, still going.
7948386	7948926	That's true.
7948946	7951747	Is John Walsh still hosting after all these years?
7951787	7952307	Probably.
7952587	7957249	Didn't they finally find who killed his son, like, just not that long ago, and it turns out the guy died?
7957609	7964656	Well, the guy that was already in prison, I think, kept confessing and then recanting it like four times so they couldn't.
7964836	7966377	But yeah, it's probably on his Wikipedia.
7966758	7967198	Oh, probably.
7968159	7969580	That was a horrible story, though, what happened.
7969700	7969860	Yeah.
7969900	7971542	Because he was, it actually involves video games.
7971562	7973844	He was playing like an Atari 2600 when he got kidnapped, right?
7974164	7975386	Or something like that, out of Sears or something?
7975946	7976246	I think so.
7976286	7977908	Or watching other kids play it, I think.
7978308	7978588	I don't know.
7978749	7978969	Anyway.
7979629	7979890	Sorry.
7980250	7981571	Don't mean to be a downer on the show.
7981631	7982092	Wah, wah.
7982132	7982752	Wah, wah.
7982792	7983253	Wah, wah.
7983553	7984714	That was it for the Twitter topics.
7985014	7989317	We'll be taking more tweets later on in the evening at twitter.com slash OLR.
7989437	7991659	I'll be tweeting random stuff and Klingon, by the way.
7991879	7992740	Thank you.
7993100	7996282	DarkTetsuya says that SalaciousPop does a great state trooper.
7996843	7997403	There you go.
7999024	7999765	Ma'am, please.
8000966	8002867	Ma'am, don't run out into the street, ma'am.
8003227	8003868	Put your shirt on.
8004588	8005289	Into the car, ma'am.
8005789	8008471	Breakman in the chat says, Ma'am, please put your shirt back on.
8008671	8009532	Oh, sorry, I meant sir.
8012560	8013361	PlayStation 3 and PSP
8030459	8038862	It is, I guess, powered by Curiosity, which is not a word, but according to Sony it is.
8039342	8057068	It is apparently going to be a music service that's cloud-based that'll, at least it'll be coming out in Europe, and subscribers will have access to millions of songs, and then, of course, it's going to be very similar to kind of the Zoom pass that's on, you know, Microsoft's service.
8057788	8071005	and it says in addition the service will be compatible with Bravia TVs, Blu-ray disc players, home theater systems, and VAIO computers with one single account without the need to manage digital files so you can listen to a bunch of stuff.
8071706	8075531	So am I correct in assuming this is just more that corporate synergy with Sony Music?
8076212	8076832	I think so, yeah.
8076892	8084836	And so probably a movie thing is... Well, I guess they already have movies on Sony Marketplace, so I guess never mind, but maybe more TV.
8084876	8086117	Just want a piece of the apple pie.
8086137	8087077	I'll come in together.
8093594	8097757	I mean, I guess if they've had movies and TV all this time, I mean, where the hell's the music been?
8098397	8101319	Once in a while, they'll have like a game soundtrack or something.
8101359	8104181	But, you know, they haven't done a major music store at all.
8104221	8104601	That's for sure.
8104621	8108003	They haven't done anything major on their services.
8109884	8111325	So, yeah, I don't know.
8112065	8112346	All right.
8113206	8117170	Well, let's move on and talk about going back to the iPhone stuff a little bit.
8118652	8120674	Actually, I used to play this game a lot.
8120714	8121795	It was Aurora Faint.
8121915	8124558	It was kind of a Bejeweled-y type game that they have on the iPhone.
8124858	8127240	Well, these guys are really taking these to the next level.
8127300	8128522	They've written their own
8128982	8130943	PlayTime is this new thing.
8131383	8133443	It's going to be a real-time multiplayer game
8157751	8162275	Playtime will allow real time voice chat during the gameplay across these platforms.
8174907	8182074	CEO Jason Citrone of Aurora Feint said, quote, Traditionally, multiplayer technology has been accessible only to top-tier developers.
8182535	8184536	It's just too complicated and time-consuming.
8184997	8190642	So we invented PlayTime, which literally takes one day to integrate into a casual game.
8191563	8200292	More information about this, VOIP, lobbies and matchmaking for casual games, expanding to incorporate team-based voice chat, 16-player game servers.
8200660	8201480	for the core titles.
8201860	8203501	So it definitely sounds like they're trying to build this thing up.
8203541	8204901	And as far as I know, it doesn't cost money.
8205302	8206022	Here's the thing, though.
8206082	8210683	The games I've noticed on my phone that do support this, it kind of gets in the way.
8211244	8214425	You only have so much real estate on the iPhone screen.
8214465	8220227	And I sort of get annoyed when I try to launch a game and I get this whole register now for open faint.
8221207	8222548	And I'm just like, fuck off.
8222708	8225069	I want to play my Commodore 64 emulator.
8225389	8230270	I don't need VOIP to play The Last Ninja on the Commodore 64.
8230731	8231111	Get out.
8231991	8234672	So some of it is kind of annoying.
8234712	8236773	They need to tone it down a little bit.
8236833	8237853	It's nice that it's there.
8238173	8239494	This technology is cool.
8239614	8241335	I think it's great that they're bridging the gap.
8241635	8243135	But don't throw it in my face.
8243756	8244076	Stop.
8244756	8247177	Have it a little button in the corner that I can use.
8248898	8270179	I guess it hides once you do kind of sign in it's just annoying I don't like trying to go into a game for the first time and it's like sign up like Tap Tap Revenge 3 I tried playing for the first time and it's like sign up for Tapulous and connect to your Facebook and like fuck off I just want to tap my screen and time to stuff
8270974	8272177	What are you looking at over there, DarkSakura?
8272197	8272577	Is that that?
8272657	8273319	Epic Citadel.
8273359	8275082	Oh, the Epic Citadel thing we were talking about earlier?
8275863	8277046	That's pretty damn nice.
8277426	8277647	Nice.
8279259	8280300	Maybe I'll take some screen captures.
8280780	8281181	We'll see.
8283263	8283723	Let's see.
8283743	8286405	I have no idea how to pronounce this.
8286505	8290589	BetaCNCRA says, I don't care about ads.
8290649	8291750	They should go die.
8291870	8292871	Go away ads.
8293491	8301238	Well, I understand that ads are what it takes to support some free things, but some of these open faint games are things I pay for, and that's where things get really annoying.
8301518	8302219	So I'm just saying.
8303260	8303500	Anyhow.
8304261	8311751	Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com if you want to chat with us live here at Orange Launch Radio as we tape our super long episode today, Labor Day weekend.
8312251	8316096	DarkSakura, you're going to have to put that down and talk about what you've got in gaming news.
8318920	8319260	Like...
8319821	8321522	Hey, can you give me a chance to finish?
8323523	8336130	Well, you know, American McGee is doing another Alice game, Alice Madness Returns, but it's going to be not over the top, so they're saying.
8336350	8347536	It's going to be adult and mature, but it's definitely going to be an M-rated title, but it's not like they're doing it just to make it an M-rated title.
8348196	8349157	They want it to be
8351258	8357561	with the established universe but have it be something more for an adult to grasp.
8358382	8358942	Not for kids.
8358982	8359662	It's not Disney.
8363885	8367667	They don't want to make it extra violent, extra gory, extra bloody.
8368207	8374050	They want the content itself, the subject matter to be where it gets the M rating.
8375091	8375631	If that makes sense.
8378343	8379424	I think it's going to be fun.
8379804	8385969	I mean, it's not going to be like over-the-top Mortal Kombat style blood, but they still, you know, Alice is still going to cut things, right?
8386089	8388030	I'm sure if she stabs something, it'll bleed.
8388511	8390372	Just won't, you know, gush a geyser of blood.
8391233	8393234	I'm really not sure how to take a news story like that.
8393294	8401360	It's like they're saying, like, well, we're not trying to go for a mature rating, but our game will have mature content, but it's necessary to the plot.
8401780	8405884	That's like telling an actress, like, your topless scene is integral to the plot.
8405944	8406264	Like, it's...
8406604	8407525	It always is.
8407565	8411948	It's artistically important to the story that you're naked in this scene.
8412448	8414070	Highbrow is what we're going for.
8414330	8414850	Exactly.
8414950	8416031	Highbrow boobies.
8416051	8420915	When the killer gets you in the shower, you see you need to be topless because you're in the shower.
8422056	8428020	I'm talking about dealing with mental illness or an abusive childhood.
8430069	8431510	Topless scenes or Alice?
8431850	8434152	No, I'm talking about... I agree.
8434192	8442778	The type of topic, though, considered mature and adult would be something like, the character herself is supposed to be kind of nuts and living a very unhappy life.
8443558	8444959	In a brothel full of topless women.
8446661	8454566	Well, usually the protagonists in Silent Hill games, once you finally find out what their origin is, it's like, whoa, that's really messed up.
8454906	8455807	He did what to his wife?
8456447	8456628	Yeah.
8456688	8457808	Or like the little girl who...
8459711	8473319	Her special bad guy was the daddy chained to the door with the knife trying to do dirty things Takeo Rei in our chatroom says the 3D boobs in Piranha 3D were very important to its plot It was!
8473619	8483184	That's a movie I haven't seen yet but I think I need to even though I think a lot of those gore movies are kind of stupid like when it knows it's over the top sometimes they're really funny
8484315	8486776	Sometimes you gotta have boobs in there just to show your cheese.
8487017	8492059	But what I don't understand is that there's actually a version... This was great.
8492099	8493120	It was in the local paper.
8493160	8495721	They were talking about the local drive-ins and how they're still going.
8496041	8500784	And they were showing Piranha at the drive-in, but it's not 3D because you can't do 3D on a drive-in screen.
8501084	8506027	And they were interviewing this lady who took her... It had nothing to do with this fact, but it should have.
8506067	8508248	She took her 6- and 8-year-old to go see Piranha.
8509308	8509448	Yeah.
8510749	8515610	and I'm not one to tell you what to do with your kids, but at the same time I couldn't help and look at that but go, really?
8516450	8517530	That's bad parenting.
8517690	8521891	You're going to take your six-year-old to go see Piranha and it's not even in 3D.
8522991	8523811	Does that make it better?
8523991	8524372	I don't know.
8525092	8530393	And then you take them to the lake the next day and then they don't want to go to the lake anymore.
8530933	8534713	DarkTetsuya says, oh, speaking of gore movies, apparently Saw is getting a 3D version.
8534813	8535774	Oh, do not want.
8536174	8536714	I heard that.
8536814	8537254	Do not want.
8538188	8542732	See, I like it when it's over the top, but I don't like it when it tries to be real like Saw does.
8542752	8543693	Do you want to see Machete?
8544533	8545634	I want to see Machete!
8545714	8548777	Jarrah Gage in chat says, Machete has fake Lindsay Lohan boobs.
8550258	8552840	I heard there was nudity from Lohan in that.
8553661	8560166	As I described Machete this morning, it's a movie based off a trailer, based off a fake movie.
8562247	8562888	Definitely want to see it.
8563305	8563865	Hobo with a Shotgun
8596346	8597507	Alright, moving on.
8597607	8601730	Loki and me and then the mailbag at mailbag at orange launch radio dot com.
8602311	8602591	Oh yes.
8604012	8612158	So, you know, of course, the Microsoft summer gaming thing worked out really well for them.
8613226	8617051	So they're going to do it again, but this time in the fall.
8617852	8622138	And they're going to call it the Microsoft Xbox Live Arcade Game Feast Promotion.
8622879	8624802	And there will be, of course, a bunch of games coming out.
8624962	8627686	It's, I guess, starting September 29th.
8628767	8630369	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8650205	8651146	Well, I like free.
8651306	8652006	Free is good.
8653307	8659893	Finally, also Super Meat Boy will be coming out October 20th to wrap the whole thing up.
8661154	8662955	That'll also be 1,200 Microsoft points.
8664556	8670281	Hopefully, we'll be able to give you guys previews on each of these games soon because I've played most of them already.
8672362	8674424	We'll talk about them in coming weeks.
8676527	8677167	Alrighty.
8677767	8681028	Any of those games you think are worth buying based off of what you played so far?
8681589	8682889	Comic Jumper was kind of fun.
8682949	8684269	It was a beat-em-up game.
8684289	8692112	It has a really neat looking... It's kind of like a comic zone, but HD-ish.
8692972	8694412	The main character's kind of weird looking, though.
8695873	8697213	He looks like a Ninja Turtle, almost.
8698414	8699434	Ninja Turtle crossed with...
8701394	8706518	I don't know, some sort of Flash Gordon and Deadpool.
8707278	8708819	And then Super Meat Boy is supposed to be really good.
8708839	8710681	I was just disappointed that it was broken.
8710841	8714083	It won't stay broken forever.
8714444	8715644	Yeah, it'll fix it eventually.
8716605	8718847	And Hydrophobia, I don't know about Hydrophobia.
8719246	8720367	Hey, price drop!
8720687	8726350	The DSi and the DSi Extra Large are going to be getting a hiccup at a bad time.
8727310	8730952	In North America, the DSi and DSi Extra Large are getting a price drop.
8730992	8734574	It's effective September 12th, so not just yet, but real soon.
8735295	8738116	The handhelds will now be $150 for the DSi and $170 for the DSi XL.
8741618	8743778	Time to clear out that inventory before the 3DS comes out.
8767583	8782336	and then the 3DS will come out and I'll have to buy that too so it's a win-win so yay price drops and all that good stuff alright let's move on to the mailbag every week you guys send us emails and you know if we feel like it we'll read them
8784102	8784882	No, we all, of course.
8784942	8786343	Of course we're going to read emails from you guys.
8786743	8789905	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send those emails.
8790285	8797648	We're going to have DarkSakura open up the old mailbag and dive in and pull out a letter right now, but not until I play the music.
8804531	8809634	Well, we actually got two emails, but I figured maybe in two hours I'll check the mailbox again.
8811727	8829706	Periodically Hello, OLR I can finally listen live to your show OLR starts at 3am on Monday in Belgium Still, I can't call in tonight I'll wake everyone Show starts at 11pm Anyways, I have a question for Loki
8830407	8835610	I have all Sega guns, Light Phaser, Menacer, Stunner, Virtua Gun, and the Dreamcast Gun.
8836010	8839993	My problem is that none of these guns, except for the Menacer, work on newer TVs.
8840513	8845536	I currently don't have room for an old TV, so I was wondering if I could make these guns work on a modern LCD TV.
8846636	8847737	And I'll just go ahead and close the email.
8847777	8849958	Thanks for a weekly OLR, you guys are so awesome.
8850118	8851159	Cyber Beast, Belgium.
8852300	8853000	No, you can't.
8855688	8867918	That's unfortunate, but you're not going to be able to do that because newer guns that they have out now basically kind of have little light sensor bars or some sort of sensor bar that attaches to the TV that you would use.
8868199	8869400	It's like Wii style.
8869480	8875305	Yeah, it's like the Wii or even if you want to go even older school like the Power Glove.
8875785	8882771	It's basically just something because they can't do the refresh stuff on the TVs anymore, so that's
8883491	8884532	What the solution is now.
8884612	8888434	So, unfortunately, you're not going to be able to use those on newer TVs.
8889735	8891216	And that should answer the question.
8892156	8892737	Last email.
8893037	8893457	Hey, guys.
8894097	8895038	Molten Brown here.
8895898	8896599	Ew.
8899060	8900261	It could be chocolate.
8902121	8906568	I was just listening to your last show and I wanted to take a shot at figuring out THQ's warped reasoning.
8907229	8916522	Perhaps to THQ, the amount that they sell to their distributors depends on how many people will buy the game new, since the distributors will only buy what they think they will be able to sell.
8917083	8924629	If the distributors are having a hard time unloading the new game because people are buying it used, then they will decrease the amount of new games they buy from the producers.
8925010	8929513	This means that in the end, THQ and other producers will get less money since distributors are buying less of their game.
8930074	8938000	While I don't agree with this reasoning, nor THQ's stance towards used gamers, I can... I'm thinking of used gamers, like the gamers themselves being used.
8939221	8940963	I can... I feel so used today.
8941103	8941663	I'm spent.
8942364	8943184	By this program.
8944745	8949388	I can kind of see where they are coming from since they are in the business to make money.
8949848	8952270	Sad though it is, that's what it boils down to.
8954231	8959074	Well, keep up the good work and hopefully next time I will be awake enough to send a longer email with some questions.
8959234	8961075	Your dutiful listener, Molten Brown.
8961295	8963316	The not gross version of Molten Brown.
8964153	8965613	Sadly, I don't think that's the case at all.
8965874	8967334	And here's why I don't think that.
8967854	8972096	Because the first game that they pulled that on was UFC 2010.
8972636	8990061	And really, they wouldn't have announced it to anybody until the day the game was released, except the fact that Destructoid got a hold of, I guess, a source of somebody who purchased the game before the street date and found out that it had this whole thing on there anyways.
8990101	8992322	They weren't going to tell anybody about it until last minute.
8992682	8993483	Thank you for watching!
9011705	9012966	and so on and so forth.
9037125	9038226	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9058378	9065044	If you can't make your online service better within the $60 price point, then you need to raise the price of your games.
9065124	9071810	Whether that's popular or not with your consumers, that's the risk you're going to have to take if that's really an issue for you.
9071870	9074472	But really, it doesn't come down to making their service better.
9074773	9080858	As far as I'm aware, the UFC stuff, I don't think they've really done anything to their online service and made it really awesome.
9081098	9084041	I don't think anyone's going, oh my god, the online UFC is so sweet.
9084221	9086322	This is way better than every other game I've ever played.
9086683	9090006	I don't think that's the case at all, and I don't think that's ever going to be the case with this stuff.
9090386	9096491	It's just an excuse that they're using to try to justify charging you an extra $10 if you buy the game used.
9097612	9103797	Breakman in our chatroom says, quite simply, if that's a plan to drive up sales, it's not a very good plan.
9103917	9105459	Yeah, I mean, that's what it was, because they...
9106821	9123866	If that was their intent, was to drive up new sales, because the way it works, it goes either you're going to have your direct consumers or your direct retailers that you're working with, like the GameStops and whatever, or the distributors that they're working with.
9123926	9128768	So either way, they have customers that need to place orders with those companies.
9129088	9133289	Then those companies say, okay, we have X number of pieces on order.
9133329	9134890	Here's how many pieces we think we need.
9135891	9140094	What we have on order plus a little bit of extra of a pad to sell later on.
9140595	9142857	And that's what they placed with the actual publisher.
9142917	9162314	If their intent was on driving up new game sales, then they would have let that news out a lot earlier so that people would go, oh, okay, well then I need to buy a new version of this game instead so that I can get my online content for no additional price, which really doesn't make any sense anyways.
9163195	9176427	Um, so that would be, they would have to do that in order for that to actually be true, but they didn't, and, you know, now they're even talking about raising the price, you know, from five to ten dollars, so...
9178365	9179645	I think it's just a big old cash grab.
9179685	9180326	That's all it is.
9181466	9185347	At some point, the video game market is going to crash under the weight of all this.
9185407	9187388	It's because they think they need some extra money.
9187468	9194650	They think that, oh, hey, well, we can make money off of each used sale because these damn used sales, they're cutting into our new game sales.
9194810	9204593	Well, I don't know if that's the case at all because I think a lot of people that are planning on buying those used games weren't going to buy your game new anyways.
9204613	9205093	Exactly.
9205313	9207354	Regardless of the fact that you don't have...
9209562	9211663	You know, online or online's extra or something like that.
9211743	9213284	You know, they may just say, you know what?
9213404	9214864	I don't need that game at all.
9215085	9218926	And then they'll be resentful against you and not buy your product going forward.
9219427	9220867	So it may have a negative impact.
9221067	9223769	And I think, overall, it's not a really good move.
9223869	9225829	But a lot of people are going to move that direction anyways.
9226910	9227190	All right.
9228171	9236915	Let's move on to, I guess, appropriately following up all this ranting, a segment we do here on the show every week called the FUs of the Week.
9237015	9237655	Gross.
9253363	9254684	F you to having to take algebra.
9254904	9256845	Not that it's a hard class, just that I hate math.
9258166	9258446	Loki?
9259707	9264710	F you to people that drive really slow in front of me or that are lost and don't seem to know where they're going.
9265150	9269493	I hate people that all of a sudden just cut over a couple lanes because they missed their turn.
9269533	9269893	You know what?
9269913	9277138	If you miss your turn, you need to make a U-turn and then correct it that way instead of just going, oh my god, and cutting off everybody.
9279349	9282237	I don't really have a lot of angst, so I'll go with the driver FU too.
9282337	9285345	FU that SUV that totally cut me off merging onto I-80 today.
9285566	9286207	She was a bitch.
9287591	9287771	Alan?
9290093	9291694	F you to hot weather, I guess?
9291834	9292234	I don't know.
9292855	9293695	I'm pretty mellow right now.
9293715	9294816	It's because you live in Silent Hill.
9295176	9295256	I do.
9295276	9296037	Where it's always cold.
9296217	9296437	Yes.
9297578	9298258	And I'm not lying.
9298298	9300860	When you drive up the hill to get to Alan's house, it suddenly gets foggy.
9300880	9302722	It could be the middle of August and it's like fog.
9303282	9304343	Bradley, how you doing over there?
9304363	9306124	Do you have an F you?
9306144	9306544	I have an F you.
9306564	9309526	I'll have no free time starting Wednesday again for a few months.
9309767	9310267	Why's that?
9311108	9312228	My second job starts up again.
9312749	9313409	Oh, good times.
9313509	9313869	Good times.
9314190	9314830	Alright, good luck.
9316171	9316491	Alright.
9316511	9317032	Alright.
9318112	9319373	That's it for the FUs of the week.
9320053	9324216	A few more news stories and then we'll get into your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
9324236	9327838	It won't be the first time tonight we'll be taking calls, but we will take some calls.
9328518	9331360	Alright, Loki, what do you got?
9331680	9335182	Retro City Rampage is a game that they're showing off at PAX right now.
9335222	9345488	It's a WiiWare game that originally was supposed to be an NES title that was going to be a port of Grand Theft Auto 3, but then something happened where that didn't end up coming out.
9345908	9357033	Now it's kind of a Grand Theft Auto 1 and 2 type of game, but it's now just all sorts of references for different 8-bit games are in here.
9357653	9366477	It's supposed to be coming out on WiiWare in December, but I mean they have everything from Contra references to Metal Gear to just...
9366977	9368338	All sorts of neat gameplay.
9368838	9370279	It just looks really cool.
9370520	9372321	And it's all done in kind of an 8-bit style.
9372741	9381707	And once again, actually that was the Grand Theft Auto 3 that ran on the NES is called Project Grand Theft Endo was the original thing.
9383108	9385810	But it's really, really cool.
9387463	9389184	So definitely worth checking out once it comes out.
9389204	9393766	I hope it does actually come to Xbox Live Arcade or PlayStation Network as they were saying.
9396086	9397167	That looks like a sweet game.
9400008	9401249	It actually does look really sweet.
9401269	9403389	I like those games that kind of get in the retro.
9403449	9407671	Although, I don't know, I wasn't super duper into the Scott Pilgrim game for some reason.
9407891	9410992	It was okay, but I don't think I played enough of it actually.
9412173	9413874	So, I don't know.
9415074	9416415	You're going to be picking this up, though, Loki?
9417216	9421719	Yeah, I haven't really played the Wii in a long time, but I definitely... Mine's still not hooked up.
9421819	9423180	I didn't even buy the new Metroid.
9423460	9427963	I know that might be shocking and awe, but I'm kind of just waiting for it to come out on Xbox 360.
9428864	9433527	Like, in my mind, I'm like, it'll come out on the 360 at some point, right?
9433587	9433988	Or the PS3?
9435609	9438955	I know, I know, I'm being stupid right now, but yeah, that's it.
9440217	9443042	And Ranma's yelling at me saying, you need to play more Scott Pilgrim.
9443843	9444925	I know, I do.
9445549	9448271	All right, going on to one more story before the calls, you guys.
9449192	9452654	The Fast Racing League is something coming out on WiiWare.
9452714	9454856	It's the Futuristic Fast Racing League.
9455316	9457237	Hmm, what could this be?
9457678	9462181	It's Jet Rocket, I guess, is the folks that make the game, or is this?
9462241	9464783	No, no, that's the other game they made.
9464923	9466924	Shin'en is the name of the company.
9467765	9470547	They're making this game called Fast Racing League.
9470627	9473869	All there is is promotion art, but there you go.
9474930	9479454	My thought when I look at this, though, is that, gee, somebody's making F-Zero for the Wii.
9479634	9481936	It's that they're not just calling it F-Zero.
9482036	9484358	It's fast, racingly.
9484438	9485739	It looks like Wipeout to me.
9486059	9486800	Super fast.
9487620	9491423	Well, Wipeout's kind of like F-Zero in a way.
9491444	9495407	Yeah, it's all the same type of stuff, but, I mean, the vehicle design looks like Wipeout.
9495467	9499350	You know what, though, that they need to be able to play that perfectly is a Nedcon.
9500631	9501131	Seriously.
9502292	9504254	Nothing is like playing Wipeout with a Nedcon.
9504727	9506128	There you go.
9524637	9527679	Tonight is coming up later during our marathon, so we'll get into that.
9527739	9530481	Unless there's any late-breaking news from this morning.
9530541	9532522	I don't know if Loki has anything he wants to share from that.
9532582	9533263	I guess we can do that.
9533683	9540427	But otherwise, we're just waiting for the calls to come in at 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9541108	9542208	And we'll be taking your calls.
9542248	9547792	This is probably not the first time tonight that the Skype line will be open, but it's open right now.
9548012	9548513	So there you go.
9549413	9551354	Borderlands level cap's going up from 61 to 69.
9551454	9551534	Nice.
9551554	9551775	For free.
9553996	9555276	Why isn't Borderlands an MMO?
9555396	9559838	Usually when I hear about level caps going up, I go, oh, it's like an MMO.
9561198	9565039	Although, Borderlands kind of plays like a Warcraft type game, doesn't it?
9565079	9569500	Except it's like first person, but doesn't it have the whole exclamation marks over people's heads and all that stuff?
9569921	9571441	Andy, you've played this game a little bit, right, Alan?
9573413	9577778	Yeah, Borderlands is pretty much like Diablo if Diablo was a first person shooter.
9578118	9582422	You know, you shoot someone and the number of how much damage you do and hit points appears over their head.
9583323	9588609	Loot is random, so you gotta go through all the loot that you get and drop the trash.
9588769	9589470	It is pretty fun.
9589690	9589850	Yeah.
9590891	9596276	I was really glad to hear that Gearbox, makers of Borderlands, got the Duke Nukem Forever contract.
9596716	9601401	Because I'm a huge fan of theirs, because they're the ones... Oh yeah, see, I forgot that they made Borderlands.
9601681	9606245	Oh, well, Duke Nukem Forever is going to be fucking awesome then.
9606621	9613785	Yeah, because they did the Half-Life, Blue Shift, and Half-Life... God, the one with the Marine.
9614605	9616146	The other expansion, I'm blanking right now.
9616346	9617527	I'm a huge Half-Life stan.
9617567	9622169	So anything that Gearbox does, because they're sort of a part of the Valve family, I'm going to be all for.
9625157	9626777	Whereas I don't think I've played a lot of their games.
9626818	9627238	I'm not sure.
9627278	9628238	All right, we're getting some calls.
9628258	9630199	Let's go to the Skype line and see what's up.
9630239	9631339	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9631359	9631719	Who's this?
9632359	9633239	Hey, it's Ranma.
9633259	9634820	Just want to know, is it happy hour yet?
9635460	9635780	Not yet.
9635860	9636980	I'm still waiting for my drink.
9637901	9640081	I was supposed to get an hour and a half ago, but that's okay.
9640642	9641082	It's all good.
9641102	9641882	You're still waiting?
9641982	9642922	I already started.
9643162	9643542	Did you?
9643602	9645383	What's the drink of choice for you right now, Ranma?
9646551	9650855	Since I have to grill tomorrow, I've been doing nothing but rum and Pepsi all night.
9650895	9652436	You have to grill tomorrow?
9652456	9654037	I didn't know you were a chef.
9654177	9656499	I thought you worked at a retail store.
9657560	9660362	I haven't worked retail in about three, four months.
9660782	9661863	You're at a restaurant now?
9662915	9664256	No, I'm talking about tomorrow.
9664336	9665456	I'm breaking out my grill.
9666036	9667257	Oh, Labor Day Barbecue.
9667417	9668917	Yes.
9669378	9669958	I'm just slow.
9670018	9670438	Hi, Dan.
9670478	9671799	Oh, Dan just walked into studio.
9671819	9672479	How are you doing, Dan?
9673519	9674300	I'm doing good.
9674580	9674760	Good.
9674780	9679041	Are you going to be joining us for more of the marathon later on this evening as we move on and take over your house for a night?
9679261	9680682	I don't think I have much of a choice.
9681622	9682023	Awesome.
9682123	9682783	Sounds great.
9683365	9683765	Yes!
9684005	9687246	Alright, so what types of games should we play a little bit during the marathon tonight?
9687266	9691648	Because at some point I think we're going to move into the vault, I don't know, or out in the living room, I don't know what DarkSakura has planned.
9691668	9692949	I told Dan to hook up Saturn for me.
9693169	9693469	Alright.
9693769	9694629	The Saturn's hooked up!
9695269	9695489	Woo!
9695730	9696310	It's in the vault!
9696710	9698291	What are you going to play on the Saturn?
9698311	9698711	Big TV!
9699671	9700671	Alright, anyhow.
9700771	9702312	I'm playing Xbox on the big TV.
9703172	9704273	Alright, I gotta get back to the call.
9704293	9705233	We'll talk more with Dan later.
9705373	9705533	Yes?
9705613	9706413	Stay black!
9706594	9707394	Yes, sounds good.
9707574	9710035	Oh god.
9712113	9713614	Boy, last week's show was interesting.
9714294	9720097	Anyhow, so what's on your mind today, Ranma, besides the whole happy hour?
9721778	9724320	I'm actually a little bit pissed at some of the people today.
9724540	9728302	I'm really pissed at people that are bitching about the $10 price increase on Xbox Live.
9728962	9729763	Why are you mad at them?
9731704	9734907	You're only paying $60 a year for this.
9735467	9737749	I understand why the price is going up.
9738349	9742293	Microsoft is actually putting the money into the infrastructure for improvements.
9742533	9745375	In order to make those improvements, something has to go up.
9746116	9753842	Unlike these other software companies who are trying to jack extra money out of us because of used games, they can kiss my ass for all I care, but that's besides the point.
9755390	9762099	Yeah, I was going to say, it feels like we're getting nickeled and dimed in every possible place here.
9762139	9768247	And it's like, I'm okay with Microsoft raising the price because they haven't in so long and they've been supporting it fairly decently.
9768587	9772312	But then when I hear this online pass stuff is being allowed too, I get irritated.
9773066	9774707	You know what I mean?
9774727	9775348	Exactly.
9775448	9780792	And if people are complaining about it, like you said, buy the cards now or do what I do.
9781393	9782814	Join Reward Zone.
9782834	9783975	They have a gamers club.
9784015	9784956	You buy games.
9785176	9785997	You get points.
9786277	9789500	When you hit $150, you get a $10 gift card.
9789940	9792062	Use that toward your live.
9792122	9793523	You save $10 that way.
9794584	9799228	So try to find different ways to exploit reward systems and point cards and all that good stuff, right?
9799941	9800301	Exactly.
9800401	9803283	Plus, Microsoft does do a buck a month deals.
9803343	9804443	Those have popped up.
9804924	9805704	Oh, that's true, huh?
9805884	9806584	I think I've seen those.
9806684	9806925	Yeah.
9807685	9811647	I saw it pop up on my dashboard on April Fool's and I tweeted about it.
9811687	9814408	Everyone thought I was lying about it.
9814468	9815809	I'm like, no, this is legit.
9816069	9817090	Here's a screen cap.
9817710	9819691	Interesting question from Derek H. in our chat room.
9819931	9824693	What are the odds that when Reach comes out there will be problems connecting because Xbox Live is overloaded?
9825534	9827715	Then we'll see just how good their infrastructure is, right?
9828954	9832998	I haven't seen it go down yet, you know, so I don't think there will be much of an issue.
9833499	9835240	I'm trying to think if it ever has gone down.
9835300	9838383	Has Xbox Live ever gone down in a non-preplanned way?
9838443	9839705	I'm sure it has for a little bit.
9839725	9840766	Yeah, there was a few times.
9840906	9842668	Never like anything too epic, right?
9843568	9845150	It was always at weird times, too, wasn't it?
9845350	9847011	It was like around New Year's or something.
9847291	9849552	I think this year it was having issues.
9850252	9851432	I will be interested to see though.
9851472	9852933	I mean, Derek has a point.
9853233	9860856	If it goes down, then this whole fact that they're charging the extra money to improve their infrastructure is kind of a line, isn't it?
9861216	9861596	Well, yeah.
9861617	9868159	If it goes down, that would suck because you're really not going to be adding too many people to the actual live service.
9868179	9869900	You're just going to have people playing a different game.
9870340	9872301	And Derek says it happened with Halo 3 and Halo 2.
9873341	9883554	I don't remember it happening with Halo 3, but then again not to sound like that guy, but I had it a couple days early so I was playing it a little bit earlier so maybe I didn't notice it.
9884575	9888139	But sometimes they try to do outages in advance to plan for this stuff, but...
9889281	9895988	I do remember a couple of times Major Nelson has said there's been issues with live and within an hour or two everything is back to normal.
9897590	9902855	Because they know they're going to have to get hell with all these people paying for it.
9903136	9908882	Whereas the PlayStation, if stuff goes down for them, it's free anyway, right?
9910476	9916798	Also, there was a few times on 1 vs. 100 where they had problems with that.
9917419	9917859	Oh, really?
9917879	9931243	Yeah, because it was kind of weird that it was doing that, because in their beta seasons they had like 150,000 at one time, and it was working fine probably back then, but it was like 50,000 that was coming in per time, and it didn't work for like two weeks.
9931483	9932143	Interesting.
9932183	9932944	I don't remember that.
9932964	9936206	But then again, I was kind of one of those people that played it more when it first came out.
9936246	9939087	And then later on, I was like, oh, it'll always be here.
9939127	9940148	I'll just play it next time.
9940168	9941128	And then, oh, now it's gone.
9941569	9942129	No more of that.
9942829	9943370	Forget that.
9943730	9944290	Oops.
9944930	9949333	That's one thing I'd hope with this extra $10 is they'd add something that's like that to replace it.
9949673	9951754	I figured we had to have that at least once during the marathon.
9951934	9952334	You know what?
9980668	9998673	I've decided that I am so sick of DarkSakura always having her stupid Vuvuzela button here on the program that what I've decided to do is that I've actually decided to counter DarkSakura a little bit here and I actually have my stadium Vuvuzela noise.
10000714	10001634	You are such a dork.
10001714	10003594	So we can have dueling Vuvuzelas on the show.
10005435	10006315	That's going to be amazing.
10006655	10007355	We'll do that, Rob.
10007715	10007996	Great.
10008016	10009376	I'm sure the listeners are so excited.
10011754	10012414	I am glad.
10012494	10014515	I'm glad conventions have banned that thing.
10018176	10018636	Turn off.
10019136	10019736	There we go.
10020417	10020977	It won't shut up.
10022197	10024438	Alright, Ranma, anything else you want to share with us for now?
10024478	10026118	I'm sure you'll call in later, but, you know.
10026398	10027999	Well, I have another story.
10028039	10029759	I can say that when I call back later.
10029939	10035461	Actually, we're supposed to be doing an outbound call right now, so I'm going to let you go for now, but call in later and give us that story.
10035701	10038361	Because we do still have more stories, too, that we're going to talk about a little later.
10039122	10039522	Wonderful.
10039822	10040082	Great.
10040794	10041215	DarkSakura.com
10053075	10082735	and yeah we're three hours in and usually at this time there's another man live at All Games Radio and some people might be tuning in to try and hear him but you can't he's not live tonight the man is Bobby Blackwolf the host of the Bobby Blackwolf show here on All Games Radio and he's not live tonight because he's at Dragon Con this weekend so sorry fans of Bobby who don't listen to us you don't get Bobby tonight or do you we're going to call him right now actually and try to get him on the show
10083715	10085616	So you can have a mini Bobby Blackwolf show.
10086036	10087297	So, two ringy dingies.
10093119	10094699	Hey, Bobby, how are you doing?
10094739	10096540	It's your buddy Rob from Orange Lounge Radio.
10097864	10100546	Hey, I'm doing great, how are you guys holding up?
10100566	10101626	That's what, hour three?
10101947	10103888	Yeah, it's on a schedule, it may cut you off later, I don't know
10121699	10123320	Oh great, just what we needed.
10124660	10126641	Who knows how long the marathon will be going tonight.
10127382	10130283	When All Games Radio decides to cut it off, we'll be done, I guess.
10130363	10131063	We'll see what happens.
10131363	10136286	Try to tweet Channel Z. We'll see what you can do for that.
10136566	10145750	Well, I figured since you're not able to do a show here live at All Games Radio because A, you're gone, and B, we took over, I thought maybe you'd want to do the mini Bobby Blackwolf show?
10147661	10154965	I can talk about what's been going on here at DragonCon and some of the neat stuff that I've done and something that we're actually going to be running next week.
10156026	10156306	Awesome.
10157267	10157627	Wait, hold on.
10157647	10158628	I didn't even know.
10158768	10159008	Hold on.
10159028	10161589	This is very important breaking news here at the OLR Marathon.
10161689	10163349	I believe I've been given a glass of liquor.
10163489	10163990	What is this?
10164010	10165510	This is my first booze of the evening.
10165690	10166090	What is this?
10166330	10170592	It's a double shot of tequila and... It better be Patron.
10170852	10171152	It is.
10171532	10172133	Okay, okay.
10172413	10173113	Okay, good, good.
10174593	10176034	I hate cheap tequila.
10176134	10176554	Sid, why?
10176874	10178035	And it's a peak grapefruit juice.
10180456	10181456	That's a tasty beverage.
10181996	10182236	All right.
10182556	10183057	I'm making more.
10183077	10183497	Who wants one?
10183677	10184137	Sorry, Bobby.
10185117	10185518	I'm making more.
10185538	10185738	I just...
10187130	10188130	There's beverages here.
10188210	10188631	Don't worry.
10188671	10189471	I don't feel left out.
10189631	10195313	Yeah, I was going to say, you sound like you're either kind of tired or maybe you've had a beverage or two yourself.
10195413	10196593	I don't know.
10197033	10198914	I actually haven't had a beverage today.
10199474	10201455	I found a quiet place kind of to be.
10202111	10206033	and then I realized this quiet place is right next to security operations for the hotel.
10206853	10209114	So I'm kind of trying to keep it down a little bit.
10209535	10209975	Ah, I see.
10209995	10210295	Okay.
10210455	10210695	All right.
10210955	10212536	Well, what's going on at DragonCon?
10212556	10217038	I know you want to tell us a little bit about what's going on over there at the show and some of the stuff you've got for your own show next week.
10218259	10226242	Well, basically, I mean, DragonCon, it's a big, it's, you know, take ComicCon and take out really a lot of, like, the industry stuff.
10226262	10227503	This is a fan convention.
10228163	10229604	There are a lot of celebrities here.
10230689	10233491	I haven't stood in line for any of those panels or anything.
10233551	10237895	I've actually been here staying away from video games, staying away from computers.
10238396	10246823	The game I've actually been playing most recently, I don't know if you've ever played this game, it's a card-slash-role-playing game called Are You a Werewolf?
10246884	10247744	Have you ever played that?
10248165	10249566	No, but it sounds interesting.
10250187	10251908	Loki, are you a werewolf?
10252188	10253990	It goes by another name.
10254010	10255051	Some people know it as Mafia.
10255111	10255852	It's the same rules.
10256803	10258925	Oh, God, wait, I have played a game like this.
10259966	10262128	No, when I played it, it was just called Werewolf.
10262168	10263769	It's a very popular forum game, right?
10263809	10267212	It's the thing where, like, you have a group of 12 people, right?
10267232	10268533	And, like, three of them are wolves.
10269094	10273037	And, like, every night, everybody votes to lynch one person.
10273657	10276340	And if the wolves are the last people standing, they win.
10276360	10277420	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
10277440	10277841	They win.
10278021	10281324	Yes, I've seen this game played before.
10281644	10282645	That's from 2 a.m.
10282665	10282985	to 9 a.m.
10283065	10283325	Okay.
10283846	10284106	Okay.
10284744	10313831	and then I sleep a little bit and about 1 o'clock I get up and go to the dealer's room and stuff like that so that's really what I've been doing staying away from video games there is a video game room here they do have consoles here that people can check out games use games from the game store that's running it from Tennessee but really it's not really the focus of DragonCon there are no game companies exhibiting here so there's not that much video game type stuff going on here
10314502	10321547	However, and this is the cool thing, I just got an interview, which we're going to run on my show next week, which, by the way, guys, is 25 minutes long.
10321948	10322348	Woo-hoo.
10322948	10327532	Do you remember, did you ever remember, in Dave and Buster's, the Battletech Centers?
10328192	10328913	Absolutely.
10328973	10330154	Dan absolutely loved that thing.
10330174	10330754	I love Virtual World.
10330814	10332476	And he was pissed when it was taken out.
10334277	10338180	I have the entire story on why it was taken out and where all those pods went.
10339101	10339281	Ooh.
10339301	10342663	Because there are eight Battletech pods downstairs, 24 hours.
10343925	10344965	right here at DragonCon.
10345866	10346486	Oh, wow.
10346726	10347286	That's awesome.
10347646	10349567	And they are still making updates.
10349627	10352568	The game actually looks a lot like MechWarrior 4 on the PC now.
10352968	10355809	They're actually, the software company is still working on new updates.
10355830	10359151	They're going to bring back Red Planet very soon as well.
10360451	10368974	And I got the story of, you know, where they travel and, you know, because basically Enthusiast bought all the pods after Dave and Buster's canceled the contract.
10369355	10370335	And the short story is
10370717	10374839	Dave and Buster's decided that they no longer wanted to have anybody working the Midway.
10374999	10390627	Everything had to be self-sustaining and so the Battletech they decided did not renew the contract with Virtual World so they were going to sell all the pods and all these enthusiasts came together and said we'll buy this set and this set and now all the sets are all over the country and some of them are mobile now.
10391127	10391547	Wow.
10392267	10392568	Huh.
10392848	10397950	And so I have a 25-minute interview with an owner of a set of 16 pods
10400229	10424652	8 of which are traveling 8 of which are in a center in Houston and we talk about you know because he was just a player and they got the funds together to buy it and they travel the country with these pods and they do maintenance on the hardware and they do the community thing and do the whole Battletech Center stuff so they're keeping the Battletech dream alive and we're going to have a long nice very good interview with him next week on the Bobby Blackwell Show
10425307	10426028	I'm excited to hear it
10440083	10440483	Dave & Buster's Jr.
10458820	10460520	Well, that's going to be an awesome interview, Bobby.
10460721	10462261	We're looking forward to that next week.
10462321	10464201	What else is going on at DragonCon?
10464422	10466342	Did you end up on a panel after all, I heard?
10466402	10466802	What's this?
10467722	10468223	I did.
10468643	10474784	The panel they had put me on was the kickoff panel, which was Friday at 1 o'clock, and I actually had to work until noon.
10475224	10475565	Dope.
10475765	10483387	And so I was all packed and everything, and I left at noon to get down here, and the trains were held up a little bit.
10483987	10488128	So I actually walked into the back of the panel at 1.15, and the place is packed.
10489252	10490653	They do call me up at about 1.15, 1.20.
10490973	10496896	I haven't even gotten my badge yet because the badge line is five hours long for pre-registration.
10496936	10500638	That's the one thing DragonCon hasn't figured out is how to pick up your badge.
10502199	10506181	I went up, did the panel, did the last 30 minutes panel.
10506221	10507102	The room was packed.
10507142	10509283	Would you like to know why the room was packed?
10509763	10509983	Why?
10510543	10511284	It wasn't for me.
10512608	10513288	This is the key.
10513348	10516870	If you ever want to have a packed panel, have Veronica Belmont on it with you.
10518610	10518970	Nice.
10519491	10520351	So she was there, huh?
10520371	10524312	No, because she was there with the Swords and Lasers podcast.
10524392	10526473	It's kind of the one that's her independent podcast.
10527273	10527894	So they're here.
10527914	10531875	They actually did a live show in a large ballroom today at 4 here.
10532555	10534196	But she was on the panel and stuff.
10534256	10539618	And so I talked a little bit about what we do at all games and stuff like that.
10540269	10553449	but yeah the place was packed and it's because Veronica was there and like when it was over everybody was rushing to get their pictures with Veronica and all that stuff so I did get to speak on one panel but that was it so my official obligations were done at 2 and I didn't even have my badge yet at the time
10553869	10561031	One of the few podcasts that I will admit to listening to, because it is pretty good, is The Instance, which is one of the World of Warcraft podcasts that's out there.
10561151	10566933	And she was actually on, they recently had a big Buku, yay, hippie, hurrah, 200th episode.
10567253	10568013	And she was on that.
10568853	10572014	And I was kind of like, oh, yeah, this is kind of interesting.
10572474	10573715	So, yeah.
10573975	10574415	Well, cool.
10574435	10576315	She does a lot of independent stuff.
10576355	10578696	I mean, yeah, she's been hired by CNET.
10578716	10582517	She works for Core, but she still really loves doing all the independent stuff.
10583297	10584437	That's awesome.
10584517	10586838	That's a good way to do it.
10586898	10587338	Good for her.
10588758	10595300	What about, like, are there any other type of record-breaking things going on there, like no Thriller dances this year, or what's going on?
10596380	10598961	Well, they can't do Thriller because the Thriller record's currently 12,000.
10600942	10604523	Mexico City set it to 12,000, so the 900, whatever they did here.
10605003	10609564	I don't know how they did, well, I mean, obviously, we won't know how they did until Guinness verifies it, but they did a
10610171	10639658	they did two existing records and they tried to set up a brand new record the two existing they wanted the most Star Trek characters in one place and the most superheroes in one place and then they created a new one of most steampunk characters in one place because steampunk's really kind of the new goth here at DragonCon everybody is steampunk and Gears and all that stuff so it used to be just Neo-Victorian and then they added all the technology to it so those are the records that they've been trying to break
10640603	10642544	but I don't know exactly how those have been going.
10643925	10644766	Sounds like fun though.
10644926	10645606	Good times.
10646307	10649409	Now, I will say I did go in the dealer's room.
10649449	10659695	There is a dealer that actually had a lot of, going back to the video game thing, a lot of rare Nintendo games, Super Nintendo games, things like that.
10660695	10663617	He actually had Earthbound for the NES.
10664357	10665138	Oh wow.
10665438	10667799	He was selling it for $130,000
10669925	10672747	and I did not get it in time.
10672807	10674929	I came back ready to get it and somebody else had bought it.
10676250	10677791	Oh, that's awful.
10678231	10682795	But it was the actual limited edition NES release of Earthbound.
10683495	10685697	He's got Little Samson.
10685737	10687978	He's got an NES core test cartridge.
10689239	10696805	So one of the test cartridges that the service centers had and he's got that for $3.50 which is a lot more than it ever goes on eBay but it's very, very rare.
10698247	10723855	but I did buy something from him Nintendo related and it's not exactly rare and you know once people see exactly what it is it's not going to sound as cool as it would when you first see it but I'm going to save that for Friday night on Friday Night Gaming oh a little tease there alright so Friday Night Gaming if you want to check that out this Friday at fnglive.net right?
10724898	10728180	Yes, and the main game we'll be playing is Metroid Other M. Because it's effing live.
10728200	10732162	But I'll be showing this game that I picked up here at DragonCon for a pretty penny.
10732182	10735504	And I overpaid a little bit, as you can expect, for con prices and stuff.
10735524	10739046	I looked online how much it is, and I could have gotten it online for a lot cheaper.
10739066	10741548	I'll tell you where you can get it once we show it.
10743509	10746131	But yeah, he had all the Mega Mans.
10746791	10749913	He had... I can't remember what...
10750834	10780435	Super Nintendo games he had like Little Samson I guess is a really rare NES game he had that in the box sitting in there so there's some rare stuff that I found in the dealer's room and I just can't afford it all we're actually looking at our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com I apologize to Bobby's fans I kind of have one eye on the all games chat room but I'm not able to follow there's a lot of chatty chat going on there right now but let's see Breakman says Earthbound for the NES and Bobby let him keep his life he got lucky hmm
10781631	10784192	Well, I bought this other thing first.
10785093	10790396	It was my first priority and then I came back and it was gone by the time I had come back the next day.
10792296	10792877	That's too bad.
10793957	10797359	You'll have to find the guy who bought it and end his life.
10798279	10805823	Alright, so if you're the guy that bought the Earthbound on the NES cartridge at DragonCon, Bobby's looking for you.
10806864	10807344	That's right.
10807924	10809305	I want Earthbound Zero sometime.
10809758	10817461	All right, well, Bobby, we don't want to keep you from the convention too much longer, but anything else you want to say about the convention or your show or anything for the folks listening?
10819342	10819842	Not really.
10819902	10822503	I mean, you know, DragonCon, it's been a fun time.
10822523	10823643	There's a lot of great costumes.
10823663	10826444	I have not seen Brad from PodCulture yet.
10826484	10827184	I know he's here.
10827785	10832846	He's out having dinner somewhere tonight, so I didn't get to, you know, I haven't been able to say hi to him.
10834127	10836168	But, I mean, no, and here's the great thing, Rob.
10836588	10836788	Hmm.
10837219	10838760	They moved PAX next year.
10838800	10840221	Did you notice that?
10841382	10842502	PAX got moved.
10842922	10843523	I did not.
10843663	10846605	It's back to its original weekend.
10846685	10849066	It is the last weekend of August next year.
10849466	10851067	It is not Labor Day weekend.
10851107	10852228	It's the weekend before.
10852708	10853148	Interesting.
10853168	10854569	Flights are cheaper.
10854589	10855850	Yeah, flights will be cheaper.
10855890	10856571	That'll be great.
10857091	10858432	Oh, I might have to do that next year then.
10859232	10863895	So I'll be able to make it out there and here and I don't have to worry about which one I'm going to.
10865227	10866669	So I was very happy about that.
10866989	10869514	I've been trying to keep an eye on PAX News and stuff.
10869714	10872879	I'll believe the dude can confirm everything when I see it.
10872999	10874942	They've got video from the show floor.
10875022	10875744	It's nuts.
10877737	10881359	I'm just, you know, then they can say, oh, by the way, yeah, it won't be coming out for another 10 years.
10882440	10884181	But it's the guys who did Borderlands now.
10884221	10888884	And, you know, we were kind of discussing earlier when it was our lead story tonight, as you can probably imagine.
10889204	10894007	We were kind of talking about how, you know, it's probably not really the same game 3D Realms was developing.
10894027	10899611	It was just kind of like, okay, well, we've bought this IP from the slaughter of 3D Realms.
10899991	10903253	Let's just take all these art assets and the idea and see what we can do with it.
10903493	10905894	And now you actually have a game because it's not the same game.
10909879	10917629	One last thing, I wanted to do my show this week mainly because I wish I was doing it because Microsoft has been showing a hell of a lot of balls this week.
10918370	10918810	How so?
10918830	10921594	With the new controller and the Xbox Live
10922950	10923470	What was that?
10923490	10928031	Yeah, Microsoft is just showing a lot of balls this week, and I'm like, damn, they had to do this on the week I'm not doing anything.
10928051	10928791	No, he is not here.
10951261	10953243	Nobody else from FNG was able to make it up here.
10953863	10959367	Derek H asks, is it true that as Chris Gore said, DragonCon is a sluttier version of Comic-Con?
10961889	10962670	Probably, yes.
10962910	10964151	Have you seen a lot of hot sluts?
10967834	10973298	I will make you really have some fun.
10973358	10973878	Oh, yeah.
10973898	10975419	Here's the thing, Rob.
10976180	10979542	The saying goes, if you don't get laid at DragonCon, you're not trying.
10979762	10980003	Okay.
10982472	10984873	Yeah, I've heard that those furries can get pretty aggressive.
10985693	10986573	It's like the Ren Faire.
10986593	10990174	Just walk into one of those little gift party rooms and you'll have a good time.
10990214	10992935	Thankfully, I have not seen a single one of them.
10993575	10994636	You haven't seen a furry?
10994816	10996676	Well, because they're all too busy at the orgy.
10996837	11001218	That's why they're... If you haven't seen a furry, you're not trying hard enough.
11002797	11030830	and they don't need a Craigslist posting to get that going they can't now Craigslist has censored the adult services section now on Craigslist apparently so there you go you don't need that here it just happens alright Bobby we're gonna let you go have fun at DragonCon have a blast especially for us since we're not there since it seems like everybody else is going to some convention but us and we'll have a drink in your honor a little later alright
11031992	11032292	Excellent.
11032332	11033913	I'll have a drink in your honor over here, too.
11034013	11034613	Sounds good.
11035093	11035333	All right.
11035373	11035993	Have a good one, Bobby.
11037214	11037514	See ya.
11037874	11038194	All right.
11038254	11042935	Bobby Blackwolf, the man who is usually live right now at All Games Radio, but it's a special weekend.
11042995	11044536	It's Labor Day weekend.
11044576	11045536	We're doing a marathon.
11045596	11046596	He's at Dragon Con.
11047136	11048297	Scott's at Burning Man.
11048917	11052538	Most people are at PAX, but we're right here in the OLR studios.
11052898	11054239	Boy, aren't we having fun together.
11056019	11058540	Actually, there's quite a few of you listening tonight, so I really appreciate that.
11058600	11060600	It looks like you guys are with us here.
11060681	11063501	So we're going to keep going and take some more calls.
11063521	11066802	1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is Orange Lawns Radio.
11066822	11070964	We'll get in at least a couple more calls before the next break and before we say goodbye to Loki for the night.
11071864	11073444	And then we'll – I don't know what we'll do.
11073484	11076645	I'm thinking maybe for the next segment, DarkSakura, I don't know what you think of this.
11076685	11081267	Maybe we'll go into the vault and just pull some random games and talk about them.
11081687	11082347	Okay.
11082367	11084208	Maybe like gaming memories or whatever.
11085248	11085428	Okay.
11085448	11088051	But we also, we need to take the chat room into the vault somehow.
11088071	11089252	Do we have a laptop or anything?
11089613	11090854	I got, well, I have mine out in the car.
11091475	11091695	Yeah.
11091835	11092236	I can do that.
11092256	11092816	Okay.
11092836	11094778	Do you know that you have the password to your Wi-Fi so we can?
11094918	11095119	Yes.
11095239	11095779	Okay, good.
11096280	11096520	Good deal.
11096540	11096940	We'll do that.
11097001	11098462	And then you get to hear what it is.
11099243	11103768	Do they have like an app or something on the iPhone that you can do like adjust in TV or something?
11103788	11104168	There is...
11106064	11108786	Yes, I have a Ustream.
11109006	11113850	We've actually had for several years, and I guess now's the time to say it, we've had a secret Ustream channel.
11114150	11125618	It's not that secret, it's just that before we went to Justin.tv, literally the week before, I reserved a Ustream for us, but we opted to go with Justin.tv because that's where the All Games Network went.
11126079	11133344	And it seemed like most of the folks in the shows that we're related to and so forth all went towards Justin.tv, so we went there for the whole Synergy thing.
11133764	11135086	because it was kind of the same thing.
11136988	11148022	Now that that isn't really the case anymore, some of our fans still broadcast on Justin.TV, and I think that's really cool, but I did get a Ustream application for the phone.
11148102	11152308	I actually did a test run the other night just to see how well it worked.
11152768	11157611	The video quality is kind of poop, but it does let you stream over 3G.
11158131	11160192	So it's kind of neat in that regard.
11160272	11160952	So I don't know.
11161032	11162673	Maybe we'll broadcast.
11162833	11166775	But I think the video quality is such poop, and we're a radio show.
11167015	11168336	I don't know if it's really worth it, to be honest.
11168476	11172839	If you associate your iPhone with the Wi-Fi here, would the app then associate with the Wi-Fi?
11172939	11177402	It would, but my concern is that it's going to choke the stream.
11177462	11183246	We were having those problems earlier when the feed was unknowingly broadcasting.
11183866	11187249	Yeah, we've had an Orange Lounge Radio Ustream for like three years.
11187289	11188029	We just don't use it.
11188530	11188890	There you go.
11188990	11190451	And I actually kind of agree with Derek.
11190511	11191672	Justin kind of sucks now.
11191792	11194414	It's just not quite what it used to be.
11194775	11198798	A Ustream has sort of established itself as the definitive place to go for streaming.
11198858	11200019	I don't know.
11200920	11201260	I don't know.
11202221	11203243	I really would have to explore.
11203283	11207428	We haven't had video so long now ever since we switched studios that I'd really have to explore that.
11207508	11208009	So we'll see.
11208990	11209271	All right.
11209971	11212435	Anyhow, I didn't mean to get off topic.
11212555	11214157	I was waiting for calls, but none are coming in.
11214217	11216099	How are we going to do a marathon with no calls?
11216520	11217141	Damn it, people.
11217781	11218142	Call!
11218242	11221525	We'll try to get at least one more call in before we say goodbye to Loki.
11221545	11226469	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.
11227009	11229952	We'll try to squeeze in at least one more call, but if you don't get in now, that's okay.
11229992	11236598	We'll open it up again around the usual time, about 8 o'clock later this evening and so forth during the OLR marathon.
11236898	11238599	We also have some more stories we're going to do.
11238619	11238659	Um...
11240191	11247297	If I have time to write them while other people are talking and I'm not so intoxicated after that drink, we will do some OLR games.
11248018	11249159	We need a listless topic.
11249199	11249919	We can think of that later.
11249939	11250340	Totally.
11250500	11251761	And we should do match game.
11251781	11252581	We'll do match game.
11252622	11254023	We have at least four people here.
11254163	11255124	With Dan, we'll have five.
11255164	11256084	So we can do a match game.
11256144	11258627	And we could also do Mad Libs.
11259607	11261009	You never did do OLR Mad Libs.
11261409	11264331	Oh, the phone is ringing and my back is turned.
11264371	11265092	I can't even see it.
11265132	11265572	Shame on me.
11266013	11266793	Let's go to the phones.
11266833	11267974	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
11267994	11268395	Who's this?
11270311	11278015	This is Haseo Haseo Oh, Haseo's, okay, hey, how you doing?
11279576	11283018	I'm doing good What is on your mind, my friend?
11285680	11290462	I just want to say that roleplaying quests are a bitch Roleplaying quests are a bitch?
11290522	11291623	What game are you playing right now?
11293164	11296766	I am playing a free-to-play MMO called Mabinogi
11297938	11299079	I have never heard of this.
11299119	11300480	You've got to tell us a little more about this.
11300860	11303062	Is there a website you can download this at or anything like that?
11304463	11308066	Yeah, the nexon.mabinogi.com.
11308307	11318014	They also do MapleStory and... So is this a very MapleStory-esque kind of game, or is this more Warcraft-inspired, or what's this game kind of like?
11318395	11320316	It's like Warcraft meets anime.
11321177	11321777	Interesting.
11322038	11322898	That could be interesting.
11323419	11324059	And it's free?
11324219	11325741	Is it ad-supported, or what's the deal?
11327319	11328359	It's 1% free.
11330280	11341684	You can upgrade to a membership for a month, which gives you a possibility to run a guild, open shops, use a bag, whatnot.
11343065	11343385	Cool.
11344065	11345966	But this game is being a pain in the ass right now?
11346186	11348927	That's why you're saying that role-playing quests are a bitch?
11350248	11354109	Yes, because each expansion is...
11355021	11355702	Interesting.
11355722	11357824	What turns you on to this game?
11357884	11358505	How'd you find out about it?
11377763	11381046	My friend actually plays it, who I was PBPing against.
11384989	11387791	Quickly, what other games types of stuff are you into?
11389432	11395196	I play just about anything except for anything that has Hannah Montana or Barbie attached to it.
11395877	11400020	You know the Hannah Montana game on DS is apparently pretty sweet, so I don't know, just saying.
11400060	11403743	I heard there was a music game on the DS that was actually pretty sweet, just saying.
11403823	11404824	Hannah needs to burn.
11405922	11408344	Any other party words for our listeners tonight before we let you go?
11415668	11416909	Neutron movie will be epic.
11417349	11427035	It better be, because DarkSakura and I are planning an epic trip that will probably preempt the show to go on this stupid trip, so stay tuned.
11427355	11430477	Alright, thank you so much for the call, Haseo, and stay tuned.
11430497	11432858	Are you going to listen for a few more hours to the marathon tonight?
11434096	11435136	Yes, I'm listening to the whole thing.
11435316	11435697	Awesome.
11435717	11436237	The whole thing.
11436257	11436777	Good luck, buddy.
11436897	11437197	All right.
11437597	11438217	Take care, my friend.
11439498	11439718	All right.
11439738	11439978	Thanks.
11440238	11440858	All right.
11440878	11443919	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
11444260	11445400	We can fit in one more call.
11445440	11445740	Why not?
11445780	11446841	We got time.
11447941	11448821	We got a lot of time.
11448841	11450822	A lot of time.
11450842	11454443	1-877-GAME-OLR if you want to give us a call or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
11455103	11456704	Have we figured out the whole dinner thing yet?
11457104	11460105	Are we doing a... We're going to get taken bakes.
11460525	11460685	Awesome.
11460705	11462266	Someone is going to make the Papa Murphy's run.
11462702	11463742	Okay.
11463942	11466483	When I sober up, I can go, but that's going to take me at least another hour.
11467084	11467324	Okay.
11467584	11468904	But I can't drink anything until then.
11469284	11470025	You want some Triscuits?
11470685	11471625	That would be lovely.
11471765	11471985	Okay.
11472245	11472486	All right.
11472506	11476047	1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
11476427	11478688	Loki's going to be leaving us after we go to the next break.
11479088	11480508	I should really take a nap when I get home.
11480548	11482529	I woke up at 4 o'clock in the morning this morning.
11482749	11484750	I was going to ask, what is it that you're going to be doing when you go home?
11486651	11487131	Babysitting.
11488337	11489899	I'm really watching the baby.
11489919	11494444	Probably go to bed at like... You know, I always say I'm going to go to bed early, but it ends up being 11.
11495725	11497808	I'm going to work on my Grand Theft Auto mods if I can.
11498308	11501231	And I have to go grocery shopping because we have nothing in the house.
11501952	11504455	And then what else do I have to do?
11509733	11511054	Maybe bid on something on eBay.
11511275	11512296	Bid on something on eBay.
11513317	11514578	Good stuff.
11514638	11524988	I might be... I should be getting a Kinect camera in the next few weeks.
11526018	11527238	Ooh, good luck with that.
11527659	11529279	And this is not one of the beta cameras.
11529299	11534700	This is actually the real retail camera with the retail version of Connect Adventures.
11534940	11537941	If the guy doesn't deliver it, though, then I will get my money back.
11538761	11539682	Something's going on.
11539982	11541862	We might not be broadcasting right now.
11541902	11544403	It looks like our Winamp is frozen.
11544503	11546203	I'm not seeing anything in chat.
11547264	11550164	But let's just keep going for the podcast's sake.
11551325	11552405	I don't know what's going on.
11554894	11557456	If folks can hear us or what have you, but it looks like... I'm keeping up with the chat room.
11557817	11558097	Shit.
11558897	11561719	All I saw, the last thing I saw was somebody saying parting words for Loki.
11562120	11563060	Did you see anything after that?
11564041	11565262	That's all I saw.
11566263	11567183	I didn't see that.
11567404	11567964	Something's wrong.
11568164	11569265	So they're not hearing us right now.
11569765	11571367	I'm going to start and stop our feed.
11571627	11573888	Yeah, it says my nickname's in use already.
11574049	11574349	Shit.
11574809	11575410	I'm disconnected.
11576811	11577591	Okay, that's not good.
11577871	11578932	So we're going to reconnect.
11579953	11581054	We're going to reconnect right now.
11582455	11583936	How many times is this going to happen tonight?
11585436	11586017	Oh shit.
11587158	11589100	And I reconnected using the wrong encoder.
11589140	11590281	That's real good, Rob.
11590481	11590982	Real good.
11593084	11595747	Live radio, the joys, the perils, the heartache.
11597847	11600008	The Trials, The Tribulations Okay, we're back up.
11600288	11600829	We're live.
11600909	11602990	So slowly folks are going to be coming back on.
11603330	11608193	That might explain why the Skype line hasn't been ringing if our internet just suddenly decided to crap out.
11609254	11611515	Alright, it looks like I'm reconnecting slowly but surely.
11612776	11614316	I've been on AIM the entire time.
11614356	11615057	It just died again.
11615297	11616218	It died again?
11617218	11619099	I've been on AIM the entire time and had no problem.
11620420	11623822	It shows that we are connected on Shoutcast.
11626553	11628334	This is bad stuff.
11628354	11631035	It says auto-accessive connections from a single host.
11631475	11632535	Oh, fuck.
11632596	11635417	G-line from Game Surge.
11635617	11641039	So we got booted from chat altogether because there's too many of us trying to connect because our ghosts were still lurking there.
11641979	11642760	That's great.
11643100	11645701	So we might have just lost the chat room for the rest of the evening.
11645781	11646661	That is wonderful.
11646881	11651023	Those G-lines reset after like 10, 15 minutes.
11651143	11652144	It really depends.
11652524	11652804	Do they?
11652944	11653784	Yeah.
11653824	11654705	Have some driskets, Rob.
11655845	11658106	Great, so now we have to marathon with no chat room.
11658727	11659647	This ought to be lovely.
11659667	11660108	For now.
11662789	11663030	Well.
11663670	11664370	Well, that sucks.
11665031	11665511	Gotta go now.
11668593	11670254	Alright, this is great.
11670955	11679240	If I probably load the Twitter, there's going to be a million people tweeting going, Try it through the web browser, because that uses like a proxy thing.
11679400	11679780	Oh, does it?
11679980	11680340	I'll do that.
11682022	11683522	I need someone to help me fill time here real quick.
11683542	11684203	I'm going to web chat.
11687170	11687890	Sometimes that works.
11687910	11689691	I'm sorry, we're all here chewing on Triscuits.
11693311	11694072	Yep, that's the marathon.
11694092	11695352	It's just going to be like eight hours of this.
11695952	11699413	Chewing on Triscuits and Rob hunting down a way to get in.
11699453	11700473	Well, I need to get our chat.
11700513	11701854	The chat's like, oh God.
11702294	11703274	It wants me to install Java.
11703314	11706035	Let me try to reconnect here real quick on the old-fashioned way.
11706515	11707115	See if that works.
11710156	11710656	We need chat.
11710756	11714897	Our skypline is supposedly open, so if somebody can hear us, you can call us.
11715217	11715537	Shit.
11717276	11722138	Yeah, no, it's showing that we're G-line still, because I guess too many of us were on at once.
11724099	11731881	We're up, though, according to... Try the chat app in IE, maybe, if it's on that machine.
11732282	11735303	Because Java may be separate for Firefox, if that's what you're using.
11737504	11738684	Oh, I will do that.
11741605	11742866	Our Skype line is still open.
11742886	11746407	1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
11747512	11748753	I'm hopping in web chat.
11748873	11750934	Your mic is also dying a lot.
11751295	11752075	I'm in web chat.
11752095	11753136	I'm trying to get there anyway.
11753276	11753536	Are you?
11753916	11756898	It still says G-Lined for web chat.
11757299	11759800	Oh, we're getting at least a call.
11759840	11761762	Hi, you're on Orange Zones Radio.
11761782	11762142	Who's this?
11762843	11763503	It's Ron McGinn.
11763523	11766385	Just call me your support team staff because that's pretty much what I am.
11766605	11767085	You again.
11767165	11767446	All right.
11767466	11769527	Well, we're up, right?
11769707	11770568	You guys can hear us again?
11770988	11772729	Yeah, we can hear you fine.
11772809	11780851	It's just that the whole G-Line thing, because that happens when there's more than three or four people from the same IP that logs into the chat.
11780991	11790075	Which is custom that DarkSakura, myself, and Loki will all log in, but unfortunately when we tried to log back in after we got booted from our internet, we all got G-Lined.
11790855	11791915	We don't have a chat right now.
11792395	11795316	I just sent you guys a tweet on how to circumvent the whole thing.
11796077	11796737	It's not working.
11796817	11798237	It still says G-Line.
11798277	11800158	Don't we just have to wait like 15 minutes and we'll be fine?
11801567	11802007	DarkSakura.com
11820882	11822863	Hello, this is Eric Hatcher, a.k.a.
11822883	11823424	Tridane.
11823564	11826145	I've been a long-time listener, but I'm a lurker, mostly.
11826606	11827906	Oh, well, hey, what's on your mind, buddy?
11828447	11829707	This is a heck of a night to call in.
11829727	11831489	We're just having technical difficulties left and right.
11831529	11832749	We can't see our audience right now.
11834270	11836151	Well, that's part of the reason I called, I guess.
11836232	11844877	If I sound out of breath, it's because I'm on the walking track, and I'm using you guys to pass the time while I work off the weight on my lord-ass gaming butt.
11845477	11845857	Wow.
11846518	11847719	What types of games are you into?
11847779	11848799	What types of games do you play?
11850899	11852140	Oh, just a little bit of everything.
11852821	11854742	Pretty much all the modern systems, I'd say.
11855843	11862769	Mostly the Xbox 360, and of course I get my MMORPG still from EverQuest.
11863430	11865832	Still EverQuest after all these years?
11865932	11866732	Why EverQuest?
11868134	11870155	Well, I guess it's because of the people I know there.
11870215	11871697	I've been on the same server for 11 years now.
11871777	11873838	And it's probably the people that keep you coming back, huh?
11880248	11881929	Really, that is exactly what it is.
11882169	11882389	I agree 100%.
11901238	11903019	Exactly why I kept playing for so long.
11903039	11903879	I don't know.
11904959	11908760	I just caught the last 20 or 30 minutes or so.
11908780	11919963	Something I guess I'd like to talk about is, I don't know if y'all are familiar, there's a game that came out within the last couple of weeks, last week or so, called Elemental, the War of Magic.
11929668	11930288	on the PC.
11930388	11931609	It's had a lot of trouble.
11931809	11932869	I think I've heard of it.
11933249	11934510	Yeah, I don't think I've played it.
11934530	11936550	I know I haven't played it, but I think I've heard of this.
11936590	11937791	Tell us a little bit more about this game.
11938911	11946134	Well, it's by the company Stardock, and Brad Wardall is probably the lead designer on that, I believe.
11946934	11956497	Pretty nice guy, but this is the worst, most buzziest piece of software I've played in the last 20 years, I guess.
11957438	11957638	Whew!
11959959	11966861	playing computer games, which is very unfortunate because the game has a lot of potential.
11966901	11973662	If any of you are familiar with Masters of Magic, it's sort of a civilization-like game with a fantasy bent.
11974723	11976763	Ooh, those are like all of my favorite games you just said.
11979364	11983905	Exactly, and it has so much potential, but it just didn't work out, unfortunately.
11984465	11984965	That's too bad.
11986423	11992147	I hate it when you've got a game that sounds like such a good idea, like on paper, but then in execution it sucks.
11993768	11994508	Ah, exactly.
11995189	11996289	Yeah.
11996629	11999871	Anyway, I just mostly called to help you out with a little bit of time.
11999891	12000532	I appreciate it.
12000552	12002153	I guess I don't really have a whole lot to say.
12002293	12002833	That's alright.
12002873	12004334	Wait, where'd you say you're calling from?
12005955	12006636	Oh, big pardon?
12006896	12007896	Where'd you say you're calling from?
12009497	12011819	Oh, basically Birmingham, Alabama.
12011999	12012379	Really?
12012479	12013300	From my home state then?
12013320	12013400	Yeah.
12014657	12015317	Oh, exactly.
12016478	12022960	Now, I've spent many, many a time up in Birmingham, although I spent more time around Dothan and Montgomery.
12024700	12026481	But yeah, Mobile's my hometown.
12028581	12029962	Nice to talk to someone from my home state.
12030422	12030802	Welcome.
12032162	12032563	Woo!
12033483	12037404	Nice talking to y'all, and I look forward to listening to you more as the evening progresses.
12037944	12038684	All right, sounds good.
12038704	12039505	You have a good one, buddy.
12039705	12040545	Thanks for tuning in.
12041945	12042386	Take care.
12042486	12042826	Bye-bye.
12042866	12043406	All right, bye-bye.
12045300	12049004	I can almost always pick out an Alabama accent.
12049525	12051868	So I was like, bing, radar.
12052688	12052949	Nice.
12053570	12055612	Alright, well we're going to go ahead and go to a break.
12055652	12060618	I just downloaded an IRC chat client to my phone to try and connect.
12060818	12061459	Oh, there we go.
12061999	12062420	I got it.
12064147	12066447	and they're saying, wait, did Loki, yeah, I can see chat.
12066487	12069068	So I have chat open on my phone right now.
12069408	12071608	So I finally have a lifeblood into the chat room.
12071688	12072649	So there you go.
12072749	12075029	So chatters, I can now see you again.
12076109	12077449	Don't send me private messages.
12077489	12080150	If you figure out what my name is on there, it's not too hard to figure out.
12080190	12081250	Don't send me private messages.
12081830	12082850	Oh, we got another call coming in.
12083891	12085411	This will be our last call before we take another break.
12085451	12086351	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
12086371	12086711	Who's this?
12088111	12089152	This is Toy Gak.
12089372	12090312	Hey, Toy Gak.
12090352	12090892	How are you, buddy?
12090912	12091372	What's on your mind?
12092797	12099585	I just called in because I'm going to give you the URL you'd need to go to to get the G-Line removed.
12099686	12100406	Okay, what is that?
12101708	12109698	It's gamesurge.net slash utils slash G-Line.
12112338	12113479	Alright, I'm looking at that right now.
12113839	12117441	Oh, 1G line found for your host, resolved in an hour.
12120302	12123264	Okay, so I'm on that page and it says why we're banned, okay.
12127346	12129006	It will only last one hour.
12130207	12132568	So there you go, we just have to wait out the hour then.
12133689	12134069	Jerks.
12134709	12137931	That's okay, so we got till 625 with no chat, but that's okay because I got chat on my phone.
12138371	12139672	I figured it out, I worked around.
12143509	12159854	Just a reminder, it's probably a bad idea to circumvent the G-line because they can tell.
12159954	12160694	I'm on my iPhone.
12160734	12161335	It's 3G.
12161575	12161975	It's okay.
12162795	12163255	We'll be okay.
12163275	12164015	We're not on Comcast.
12164055	12164856	It shows us 3G.
12165536	12166356	It'll be our little secret.
12170819	12172462	Alright, well thanks for the tip, we appreciate it.
12172743	12175629	At least we know it's only for an hour, so we know we'll be able to get back in.
12176891	12178014	Alright, have a good one buddy.
12179668	12180409	Okay, bye.
12180689	12181329	Thanks for the tip.
12182250	12186392	Alright, we're gonna, on that note, I think we need a break after that, oh boy.
12186792	12189094	Alright, people are saying hi.
12189434	12190374	Why were you banned?
12190535	12192876	Well, they don't like more than three people on the same IP.
12192956	12193957	Drew Nami's got it there.
12194597	12203862	And they're saying actually it's five, says Toagak, but I don't... It says three on the page that explains why you're G-lined.
12204283	12204543	Weird.
12205283	12214267	When various clients try to reconnect and disconnect due to internet issues within a certain amount of time, the server has no way of knowing what's going on and it kind of thinks it's a DDoS.
12214507	12216528	It's a denial of service.
12216748	12217929	It's just a failsafe.
12219109	12220470	I'll forgive them someday.
12220850	12222851	I'll find it in my heart to forgive them.
12223171	12227133	We're going to actually say goodbye to Loki at this point before we go to another break.
12227733	12229854	Loki, any final words for our listeners tonight?
12230390	12231911	No, I just have to go get groceries.
12232552	12233153	That's always fun.
12233173	12234494	Because I don't like chores.
12234814	12235895	Alright, well good luck with all that.
12236415	12241280	This is actually the part of the show where we would be saying basically goodnight for listening.
12241340	12244222	This is kind of the end of the normal part of the show, if you will.
12244603	12246184	We're going to be getting into the more random stuff.
12246224	12251248	So if you're just looking for your normal quote-unquote edition of Orange Lounge Radio, this is kind of the end of that part.
12251689	12254391	But we will be back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
12254431	12256153	Now just so you know, for the podcast feed...
12256593	12259537	We're going to be releasing the marathon in bits this week.
12259657	12262240	So you may not see everything up right away.
12262380	12264723	So just give it a little extra time.
12264803	12271672	If you're done listening to this part of the podcast and you want more, just give it a little more time.
12271692	12272252	That's all we need.
12274634	12280079	Real quick, I was going to say we're having our game summit, my work game summit thing.
12280619	12285383	We do it usually each year and we have the game publishers coming out and talking about stuff.
12285783	12290967	So maybe I'll learn some new information and we can share at appropriate times if you know what I mean.
12291337	12291597	All right.
12292098	12294059	And that'll be something to look forward to next week, yes?
12294099	12294379	Possibly.
12294439	12297142	And also, hopefully, I'll have a new iPod by then.
12298222	12298523	All right.
12299103	12300304	Well, I don't know.
12300324	12304287	Should I play the closing song that we usually play at the end here?
12304367	12305648	Play our little closing song?
12305768	12306209	Go for it.
12306229	12308270	Sure, because you've got to put it on the podcast anyways, don't you?
12308871	12309491	I guess that's true.
12309571	12310452	So let me see.
12310692	12311613	Now I have to cue that up.
12311953	12312814	That involves work.
12313314	12333196	so goodnight everybody thanks for listening we'll be back though if you are listening live or on podcast or whatever we still got the marathon coming up and plenty more show who knows what randomness is going to happen when we don't have a chat room going on here and some folks in chat are saying goodnight and they're waving even though you can't see them and I'm getting everything up from uh
12335478	12339621	Let's see, Toagak says if my IRC server was up, I would let them bounce IRC off of me.
12339681	12340462	Oh, that's a good idea.
12340522	12345245	Somebody should put up like a fake server that we can go on and at least see our chat room still.
12345385	12349108	Yeah, my roommate has a Linux box running in the spare bedroom.
12349508	12349869	Oh, really?
12349989	12352050	So I could shell into that and we can IRC from there.
12352631	12355553	That might be a good idea, but I'm not going to worry about it too much.
12355593	12356473	It's just an hour, right?
12356493	12357234	We can make it an hour.
12358155	12358595	We can do it.
12359366	12365650	Alright, we're going to play our outro, say goodnight, and we'll be back though with more of the OLR Marathon right after this.
12382702	12383103	See you next week!
12383123	12383843	See you next week!
