00:00.000 --> 00:09.920
Hi everybody, it's Rob Roberts again here at E3 for a little special show for our feed

00:09.920 --> 00:10.920
here.

00:10.920 --> 00:12.920
Rob Roberts and Pals at E3.

00:12.920 --> 00:18.400
It's the Wednesday edition or the second day of E3 although that's somewhat of a fib because

00:18.400 --> 00:21.000
it's technically Thursday right now as we tape this.

00:21.000 --> 00:25.420
It's after 1230 in the morning so it's even later than we taped last night but you'll

00:25.420 --> 00:29.120
notice my voice at least is doing a little better today so that's a good thing.

00:29.120 --> 00:32.280
So I hopefully won't be straining as bad as I was yesterday.

00:32.280 --> 00:36.120
Anyhow, let's get right into the show and talk about some of the things we saw today.

00:36.120 --> 00:40.240
We don't have a lot of news for you guys or anything because I'm sure a lot of you guys

00:40.240 --> 00:41.520
have been reading the different websites.

00:41.520 --> 00:44.920
We talked a lot about what the press conferences were all about yesterday but we just want

00:44.920 --> 00:48.240
to tell you about our perspective on some of the things we tried and some of the things

00:48.240 --> 00:49.240
we got our hands on.

00:49.240 --> 00:53.640
I know a lot of our listeners have come to want to know what we think of some of the

00:53.640 --> 00:55.660
games we get to get our hands on.

00:55.660 --> 00:59.100
So I'll tell you a little bit about my experience in a little bit but we want to catch up with

00:59.100 --> 01:04.440
definitely a pal of Orange Lounge Radio, somebody who's been a supporter of our show for a very

01:04.440 --> 01:05.440
long time.

01:05.440 --> 01:06.440
We try to support him too.

01:06.440 --> 01:10.640
The one and only, straight out of Atlanta, Bobby Blackwolf is here.

01:10.640 --> 01:12.040
Woooo, that's me.

01:12.040 --> 01:13.540
How you doing?

01:13.540 --> 01:19.960
So I wasn't able to be a part of the show last night because I was getting drunk and

01:19.960 --> 01:23.800
attempting to Rick Roll the entire Bethesda party and failed.

01:23.800 --> 01:24.800
It was very terrible.

01:24.800 --> 01:29.080
It was the low point of my E3 when they turned off the karaoke at 1am and I was one step

01:29.080 --> 01:33.120
the song away from Rick Rolling everybody.

01:33.120 --> 01:35.280
That's my biggest disappointment of E3.

01:35.280 --> 01:38.920
But I do have to throw this in though.

01:38.920 --> 01:43.600
He may not have gotten to Rick Roll everybody but if you do want to see his awesome Night

01:43.600 --> 01:47.920
of Fire routine, it's like all over Twitter right now so check that out.

01:47.920 --> 01:51.280
Yeah, we're getting to that.

01:51.280 --> 01:58.500
I do want to say that I was a part of the Activision saying, hey we didn't have to pay

01:58.500 --> 02:04.320
that bonus to Infinity Ward, let's throw a party event, which was, you've probably read

02:04.320 --> 02:10.500
about it and seen it, it's the 6 million dollar party they threw in the Staples Center on

02:10.500 --> 02:19.460
Monday night showcasing just four games, DJ Hero 2, Guitar Hero, Warriors of Rock, True

02:19.460 --> 02:26.840
Crime Hong Kong, and Call of Duty Black Ops with some cheap performers like Usher and

02:26.840 --> 02:35.400
Jane's Addiction and Soundgarden and this guy named Eminem with Rihanna and a stripper.

02:35.400 --> 02:36.960
I love Eminem's.

02:36.960 --> 02:39.600
Yes, I only want the red and black ones.

02:39.600 --> 02:45.300
But the highlight obviously was the pole dancer, I'm not going to say stripper because she

02:45.300 --> 02:52.680
didn't strip, but the pole dancer, they lowered a pole from the rafters of the Staples Center

02:52.680 --> 02:58.200
and she literally went probably about halfway up, which is like to the club seats on this

02:58.200 --> 03:02.640
pole and hanging upside down and all that stuff, she stole the show.

03:02.640 --> 03:10.360
So yeah, 6 million dollars and on top of that they gave us free beer.

03:10.360 --> 03:14.260
Well clearly they had to bring in a pole dancer because the video game industry is so dominated

03:14.260 --> 03:16.680
by women and gay men.

03:16.680 --> 03:25.600
Exactly, but to me that was the biggest F you to the former Infinity Ward guys because

03:25.600 --> 03:28.300
that was probably their bonus that they spent.

03:28.300 --> 03:33.100
But hey, let me tell you guys this, you have never witnessed a video game trailer until

03:33.100 --> 03:36.840
you see it with full pyrotechnics all around you.

03:36.840 --> 03:42.200
The Call of Duty trailer is the same one you've probably seen online except they decided that

03:42.200 --> 03:46.880
it was going to, instead of the music being canned, they actually did have a full orchestra

03:46.880 --> 03:51.040
down in the pit playing the music for the trailer because the conductor was up on stage

03:51.040 --> 03:52.040
and I'm like, what is he conducting?

03:52.040 --> 03:54.760
Oh, there's an orchestra down there because that was far in the back.

03:54.760 --> 03:59.400
And then like halfway through, you know, just one big pyrotechnic like with explosion on

03:59.400 --> 04:03.680
the screen, pyrotechnics went around and I was like, oh that's cool, they did some pyrotechnics.

04:03.680 --> 04:07.600
And then every explosion for the rest of the trailer had either pyrotechnics or firecrackers

04:07.600 --> 04:12.640
from the top and that was the way to experience a trailer.

04:12.640 --> 04:15.840
I'm still not going to play Call of Duty Black Ops.

04:15.840 --> 04:18.980
Is it possible that maybe they didn't just do it as like kind of like, you know, spend

04:18.980 --> 04:22.520
all that bonus money that, you know, they were supposed to pay out but that maybe they

04:22.520 --> 04:26.400
sold the booth on eBay as well because I noticed their booth is nowhere to be found.

04:26.400 --> 04:30.680
So I think maybe they sold all the parts of the booth and that may be paid for like the

04:30.680 --> 04:33.720
Dom PÃ©rignon that Eminem needed backstage.

04:33.720 --> 04:35.800
Yeah, probably.

04:35.800 --> 04:36.800
They do have a presence.

04:36.800 --> 04:38.240
I mean they've got a place.

04:38.240 --> 04:40.560
They've got some meeting rooms.

04:40.560 --> 04:45.280
Basically what they're doing is that, you know, by appointment you can go in and basically

04:45.280 --> 04:49.840
they have these little rooms where you get a 30-minute demo of the game and sometimes

04:49.840 --> 04:52.700
hands-on and that's where they're showing all their games.

04:52.700 --> 04:56.840
But it's by appointment only and they like it a lot better because it's not as hectic

04:56.840 --> 04:58.440
and loud and stuff.

04:58.440 --> 05:03.680
So I did get to actually go in and see Guitar Hero, Warriors of Rock.

05:03.680 --> 05:06.960
I have not been able to see Rock Band yet so don't ask me which one's better.

05:06.960 --> 05:10.360
But you know, kind of going into games and this is, you know, this was actually one of

05:10.360 --> 05:13.040
the most recent things I saw as well.

05:13.040 --> 05:19.800
It's Guitar Hero but they showed us the Quest Mode which is, it's not Career Mode, it's

05:19.800 --> 05:25.040
Quest Mode now and it actually brings a little bit of, you know, it gives you a different

05:25.040 --> 05:29.280
reason to go through the song list other than I want to unlock all these songs.

05:29.280 --> 05:33.160
And then they showed the Quick Play Plus Mode which to me kind of scratched my eye because

05:33.160 --> 05:36.440
they said, yeah, we added so much stuff we couldn't call it Quick Play.

05:36.440 --> 05:40.440
If you've played Guitar Hero 5 or Band Hero, you know about those challenges.

05:40.440 --> 05:45.280
That's what they added to Quick Play was all those challenges and you can also compete

05:45.280 --> 05:49.760
against the score of a friend kind of like in Geometry Wars where you can select a friend's

05:49.760 --> 05:54.640
score off of the leaderboard and then it will show you how close you are to his score.

05:54.640 --> 05:59.160
And then you can send him a message on Xbox Live making fun of him because you just beat

05:59.160 --> 06:00.160
his score.

06:00.160 --> 06:04.240
Will I be able to spam his Twitter and his Facebook and everything else too?

06:04.240 --> 06:08.320
No, I think it is just OS, they've said it was just OS messages.

06:08.320 --> 06:14.020
So it's, you know, you receive an Xbox Live message, kind of like what I get from Spazinator

06:14.020 --> 06:19.520
in some games that, you know, he beat my high score in something.

06:19.520 --> 06:22.780
Or the ones I love is that, you know, so and so wants to play Modern Warfare 2 with you

06:22.780 --> 06:25.260
and I'm like, okay, do you listen to OLR?

06:25.260 --> 06:27.920
Like I just, no disrespect to those games.

06:27.920 --> 06:33.080
I understand why they have an audience and so forth, but it's just out of the literally,

06:33.080 --> 06:36.560
and especially being at this show this year, literally hundreds of games that are available

06:36.560 --> 06:41.120
to play that's just not, you know, high in my queue, you know, but it's just funny that

06:41.120 --> 06:44.140
I get those invites once in a while.

06:44.140 --> 06:47.120
So yeah, so that's Guitar Hero.

06:47.120 --> 06:51.920
The one you were referencing earlier that I've played was Dance Masters from Konami

06:51.920 --> 06:58.240
which broke my Kinect virginity because unfortunately, see what I've been doing, I've been working

06:58.240 --> 07:01.760
with E3coverage.com and we do a lot of interviews and stuff.

07:01.760 --> 07:07.580
So when we go into appointments, it's not really about for, you know, for game tactics,

07:07.580 --> 07:12.240
for Justin Lee who's the editor of Game Tactics, it's not really about seeing the games, it's

07:12.240 --> 07:14.080
about getting the interviews.

07:14.080 --> 07:18.680
So we had an hour long Microsoft appointment and didn't see a single game because they

07:18.680 --> 07:25.040
brought in like, since it's also a Canadian site, they brought up like the Xbox Live manager

07:25.040 --> 07:31.280
for Canada and we interviewed him, the hardware manager for Canada and some, you know, basically

07:31.280 --> 07:35.000
a lot of, you know, and you know, general people about Xbox in Canada and that was the

07:35.000 --> 07:37.560
entire hour was standing up there.

07:37.560 --> 07:43.560
So I didn't get to really play Kinect except in the Konami booth and I'm a sea dancer is

07:43.560 --> 07:45.220
what it said.

07:45.220 --> 07:49.520
Now one thing I do want to say about it is the menu system, this is what kind of threw

07:49.520 --> 07:53.140
me a little bit, there might be a learning curve for some people because in the menu

07:53.140 --> 07:57.440
system for at least Dance Masters which is a third party game, so maybe Microsoft has

07:57.440 --> 08:00.720
it better, it's very sensitive to your movements.

08:00.720 --> 08:05.080
So basically you do the minority report type of thing like, you know, let's, what happened

08:05.080 --> 08:10.280
to us is, you know, selecting the difficulty level between light and standard and to hit

08:10.280 --> 08:16.160
okay in Dance Masters, you have to put your hand up and then to the right and then, you

08:16.160 --> 08:19.600
know, kind of to touch the okay thing that's at the top right of the screen.

08:19.600 --> 08:24.540
Well when I had done it, I had said, okay, we're going to do standard and when I moved

08:24.540 --> 08:28.440
my arm up and it's kind of funny, I'm doing this hand motion, I know you can't see it

08:28.440 --> 08:33.560
but it's so I can explain it, you're supposed to move your hand up and then to the right.

08:33.560 --> 08:37.680
Well when I moved it up, I didn't exactly move it straight up, I went a little bit to

08:37.680 --> 08:42.840
the right and as I did that, it moved down to light and then but I had already started

08:42.840 --> 08:44.800
the motion of hitting okay.

08:44.800 --> 08:47.560
So it's going to take a little bit of getting used to, you have to be a little bit more

08:47.560 --> 08:52.160
precise than you think and they're going to sit there and say, there's no learning curve

08:52.160 --> 08:53.640
but I think there might be for some people.

08:53.640 --> 08:57.840
Well, you know, I had a little hands on time with Dance Masters today too and, you know,

08:57.840 --> 09:01.400
I played a song on there too and was going through the menu and what kind of threw me

09:01.400 --> 09:04.940
was that, you know, Natala is supposed to be this whole, you're just going to hold up

09:04.940 --> 09:09.240
your hand and wave it around and as you wave it around, you'll be able to select the songs

09:09.240 --> 09:13.520
or, you know, whatever it is, change the channels, you know, but I found as I was going through

09:13.520 --> 09:17.320
this Dance Masters, it was like, okay, to choose a number of players, you're going to

09:17.320 --> 09:20.200
kind of, you know, put your hand up and then you're going to put it over to the right and

09:20.200 --> 09:23.600
then it was like, okay, change the difficulty, you're going to kind of reach around to left,

09:23.600 --> 09:26.440
it's like, you know, you put your right hand in, you put your right hand out, can I shake

09:26.440 --> 09:29.960
it all about, okay, do the hokey pokey, turn yourself around, you know, it's like, oh my

09:29.960 --> 09:33.920
gosh, like maybe it's just there's going to be a natural learning curve with all that

09:33.920 --> 09:38.060
stuff and I'm being a little harsh but I was kind of like, gosh, I'm having to dance just

09:38.060 --> 09:42.360
to get through the freaking menus on this game and, you know, I'm not really picking

09:42.360 --> 09:46.200
on Dance Masters in that regard because it seems like even the other one I had played

09:46.200 --> 09:51.160
the other day, Dance Central, maybe didn't have as complex menus because their demo version

09:51.160 --> 09:56.000
was very tight and there wasn't a lot to pick from but, you know, it just seems like I'm

09:56.000 --> 10:00.200
worried that in these Kinect games, it's going to be hard to navigate a lot of the menus

10:00.200 --> 10:06.400
like it is in iToy. Yeah, I remember that, you know, where you have to like wave your

10:06.400 --> 10:12.760
hand over the circle and stuff and yeah. So, but that's the only Kinect experience I've

10:12.760 --> 10:17.440
had, I'm probably not going to be able to see Kinectimals or any of the other stuff.

10:17.440 --> 10:23.400
I did touch PlayStation Move, you know, there was unfortunately we had to cancel our Sony

10:23.400 --> 10:28.000
appointment for another interview with an exec and so that's what, so they cancelled

10:28.000 --> 10:33.720
the Sony appointment but they do actually have some move games that are not required

10:33.720 --> 10:38.920
to stand in a three hour line to get to. So I played Bowling, Brunswick Bowling and I

10:38.920 --> 10:43.480
will say that the controller actually feels good in your hand, I mean it's, you know,

10:43.480 --> 10:50.480
it feels a little bit better than holding a Wii remote to me but Bowling, I mean it's

10:50.480 --> 10:53.860
kind of hard to see how more precise it is than like the Wii remote when you're playing

10:53.860 --> 10:59.040
Bowling because that's such like the simplistic version and the Wii does a very good job Bowling

10:59.040 --> 11:07.220
already. But no, it was really good to use and there was rumble in the controller and

11:07.220 --> 11:14.080
everything so I really don't know what I can really say about it, I didn't get to play

11:14.080 --> 11:17.720
the stuff they're really showing because I'd have to wait in a three hour line and I just

11:17.720 --> 11:22.800
don't have three hours. Alright, well, you know, I know Shane and I have a whole list

11:22.800 --> 11:26.600
of games we want to go over but Bobby since, you know, yesterday, between yesterday and

11:26.600 --> 11:29.680
today are there any games that have kind of caught your eye that you want to, you know,

11:29.680 --> 11:35.560
mention to the listenership right now? Okay, so here's one that, now, got to realize guys,

11:35.560 --> 11:40.520
before I say this, last year my second favorite game of show was split second and I'm not

11:40.520 --> 11:44.840
a fan of it now, now that it's out. So take this with a grain of salt because this might

11:44.840 --> 11:51.460
be another one, Driver San Francisco, which was in Ubisoft, you know, yeah the Driver

11:51.460 --> 11:56.840
games recently have been pretty bad, the ones that were by Atari or were published by Atari,

11:56.840 --> 12:00.100
but they've kind of gone back to the roots of the first Driver which was actually pretty

12:00.100 --> 12:07.840
good and the gameplay mechanic or gimmick or whatever you want to say in this was great.

12:07.840 --> 12:12.520
Basically the storyline for it really quick because it makes no sense, they obviously

12:12.520 --> 12:17.160
made the storyline to fit the gimmick rather than making the gimmick fit the storyline,

12:17.160 --> 12:21.880
is that the character you play is in a coma. He doesn't realize he's in a coma, he just

12:21.880 --> 12:26.000
thinks he has superpowers, but you're playing the entire game in his head and essentially

12:26.000 --> 12:31.840
he's learned that his superpower in this coma that's in his head is that he can jump, he

12:31.840 --> 12:38.220
can shift, that's the actual term in the game is shift, from car to car. So you can be driving

12:38.220 --> 12:43.420
along in a car, hop out, all you do is you hit the A button, it goes to an aerial view

12:43.420 --> 12:51.240
in this white light of God or whatever, and you can select another car, hit A, and then

12:51.240 --> 13:01.560
you're immediately in that car driving around. So you basically can jump from car to car

13:01.560 --> 13:06.240
and then in missions and stuff, the way you activate missions is you see a police chase

13:06.240 --> 13:11.800
in progress, you can activate that mission, you can either shift into the police car or

13:11.800 --> 13:16.560
into the getaway car and you can complete the mission that way. And you can even do

13:16.560 --> 13:25.720
stuff like one of the missions I did had two cop cars chasing the runaway and I could switch

13:25.720 --> 13:31.200
between the two cop cars just with the press of a button. And so if I kind of messed up

13:31.200 --> 13:35.200
with one and crashed into a wall I could jump into the other one, the AI would take over

13:35.200 --> 13:41.600
that car, get it back up, and you can do it that way. And then what they said is, okay,

13:41.600 --> 13:45.060
you might not be able to catch them with the cop car so you can shift out. And there was

13:45.060 --> 13:50.660
a big rig about three blocks down. I shifted into the big rig and did a head-on collision

13:50.660 --> 13:56.200
and that completed the mission. And they also said it's online and yes, you can shift around

13:56.200 --> 14:00.240
online so it's like online races and stuff are going to change a lot with this because

14:00.240 --> 14:04.240
everybody is shifting into other cars and if you have enough, they didn't say exactly

14:04.240 --> 14:08.000
like how you can build up the shift power or whatever, but you could actually shift

14:08.000 --> 14:13.080
into one of the other people's cars and kick them out and they have to get another car.

14:13.080 --> 14:16.400
So it's going to be interesting to see, I mean it was a great demo, just like Split

14:16.400 --> 14:19.880
Second was, it's going to be interesting to see if it delivers in the final product.

14:19.880 --> 14:24.200
Alright, I have to admit I've always had zero interest in the Driver series besides just

14:24.200 --> 14:29.000
kind of like making fun of Driver 3, but that whole kind of play mechanic sounds really

14:29.000 --> 14:33.680
interesting. What about like maybe one other game that's kind of caught your attention

14:33.680 --> 14:42.960
over the past couple of days? Okay, well basically it's not really a game, the 3DS. I was able

14:42.960 --> 14:47.720
to go out and get my hands on the 3DS and as I've said on my show, I am one of the 15%

14:47.720 --> 14:54.400
of Americans that cannot see the 3D TV. I cannot see Avatar in 3D. Basically it looks

14:54.400 --> 14:59.500
like a darker 2D to me. It's because of my eye problems. I had eye surgery when I was

14:59.500 --> 15:05.280
3, so my doctor knows about it and there's really not much we can do about it. That being

15:05.280 --> 15:12.160
said, if I turn the slider on the 3DS all the way up and hold it at an extremely specific

15:12.160 --> 15:19.960
angle, I can see 3D in the 3DS. I can actually see it. They had a trailer of Metal Gear Solid,

15:19.960 --> 15:26.200
or the Metal Gear game that's going to be on the 3DS and I was flinching as some of

15:26.200 --> 15:31.360
the things were flying at me. Now the problem with this is that that's great for trailers

15:31.360 --> 15:39.760
or watching a movie or whatever. I tried to play Star Fox on it in 3D and I realized how

15:39.760 --> 15:46.680
much I move the unit when I'm playing. If I move it any little bit, it starts getting

15:46.680 --> 15:52.280
to be double images because basically it's prisms and stuff. So essentially what would

15:52.280 --> 15:58.200
happen is I would move it just a tiny bit and then it would start seeing double images

15:58.200 --> 16:02.320
and stuff. So I just turned the slider down to 2D. But it's still great in 2D. It's

16:02.320 --> 16:08.200
still a better looking system than the DS. The graphics are improved even in 2D. I might

16:08.200 --> 16:13.240
not be playing the 3D stuff all that much, but the 3D actually does work with my eyes.

16:13.240 --> 16:20.240
Whereas Avatar in the movie theater and my dad's new Panasonic 3D TV, I took my PS3

16:20.240 --> 16:27.040
over and I couldn't see the 3D and my parents thought it was amazing. Nintendo got you there.

16:27.040 --> 16:31.600
That's pretty cool though because you must have had that moment of like, whoa. Because

16:31.600 --> 16:36.200
I think when everybody sees the 3DS for the first time, and we talked about this extensively

16:36.200 --> 16:41.280
yesterday, but just to kind of recap, I kind of said, okay, yeah it's a little gimmicky,

16:41.280 --> 16:46.320
but it's a damn impressive gimmick. It definitely has the games to back it up and you go back

16:46.320 --> 16:49.920
to the golden rule of gaming, the system is only as good as the games that are on it.

16:49.920 --> 16:53.240
You know there's tons of great games coming out for this thing and graphically it's an

16:53.240 --> 16:58.680
upgrade. But all gimmicks, so and so aside, there's still that moment when you first see

16:58.680 --> 17:06.480
it where you're just kind of like, whoa, it really is kind of 3D and I'm not wearing glasses.

17:06.480 --> 17:12.160
That's kind of cool. I mean, surely you probably had kind of that similar thing, but even probably

17:12.160 --> 17:16.680
like double or triple so because you probably were very skeptical about it. Well actually

17:16.680 --> 17:23.000
the first time I tried it I was looking at the Resident Evil trailer and I didn't really

17:23.000 --> 17:27.560
know how the system worked so I was just kind of sitting there looking at it and I'm like,

17:27.560 --> 17:32.840
yeah I don't see the 3D because they actually have these women behind there, behind each

17:32.840 --> 17:39.920
system to kind of talk you through it. And I couldn't see it in the Resident Evil because

17:39.920 --> 17:45.120
it was all double vision. I didn't know about having to tilt the angle vertically kind of.

17:45.120 --> 17:48.400
You know, I kind of had to tilt the screen to be a specific scene. It's different for

17:48.400 --> 17:52.640
everybody's eyes. And they didn't tell me that so I was just like, I can't see the 3D,

17:52.640 --> 17:57.440
it's all just double images to me. And then I went over back to our PR rep and I was like,

17:57.440 --> 18:01.340
yeah I didn't see it and they're like, well try this because the Metal Gear trailer was

18:01.340 --> 18:07.320
more popping than the Resident Evil one. It was more extreme. And one of the girls behind

18:07.320 --> 18:12.520
there said, I'm blind in my left eye and I can see the 3D in this. And so she trained

18:12.520 --> 18:19.280
me and said, you should try tilting it this way and doing that. And then basically it

18:19.280 --> 18:23.220
was right at the beginning of the Metal Gear trailer, there's the Kojima Studios logo and

18:23.220 --> 18:28.400
it flies at you. That was my flinch holy shit moment, was the Kojima Studios logo flying

18:28.400 --> 18:33.280
at me because I had finally gotten it right at the right angle and the woman, she was

18:33.280 --> 18:37.920
very nice, but she said, yeah I'm blind in my left eye but I can still see this. And

18:37.920 --> 18:43.480
she kind of helped me get it to the right area. I'm almost blown away but that is amazing.

18:43.480 --> 18:49.840
She's blind in one eye and she can see it. That is a trip. That is very, very cool. Well

18:49.840 --> 18:52.480
Bobby, if you don't mind, I'm going to spend some time with Shane and talk about what we

18:52.480 --> 18:55.280
talked about today, but we'll come back to you a little later and see if there's anything

18:55.280 --> 18:58.560
you want to add. If you want to jump in, just let me know. We only have kind of one mic

18:58.560 --> 19:02.760
we're passing around here. You know, a very ghetto little portable kit. So again, if the

19:02.760 --> 19:06.840
sound quality is bugging you, I apologize. This is much, much different than the usual

19:06.840 --> 19:11.120
Sunday setup with a Dark Soccer and Loki. I do really, really want to make sure I do

19:11.120 --> 19:14.280
plug the one and only Bobby Blackwolf show though. I'm sure most people that are actually

19:14.280 --> 19:18.400
taking the time to listen this far into this already know about his show, but if you don't,

19:18.400 --> 19:22.640
he's on right before us live on Sunday nights at All Games Radio, 5 o'clock Pacific, 8 o'clock

19:22.640 --> 19:30.640
Eastern. Check it out. Miklotov, Shane, how you doing? Barely awake. Well I'm sorry, I

19:30.640 --> 19:36.160
know we're keeping you up very late, but did you have a good day at E3 today? Yeah, despite

19:36.160 --> 19:40.060
the fact that it wasn't the day we played the 3DS. I think today was a little bit more

19:40.060 --> 19:47.000
fun, so that's how E3 should go I guess. Alright, well Shane and I kind of made a list of everything

19:47.000 --> 19:52.120
we either kind of spent a long time looking at and got a tour through, or you know, we

19:52.120 --> 19:55.120
actually got some hands-on time and played, so you want to go through this list a little

19:55.120 --> 20:01.160
bit Shane? Let's start off with a game that kind of really surprised me with how much

20:01.160 --> 20:06.880
I liked it, DC Universe. What did you think about DC Universe, Shane? It was actually

20:06.880 --> 20:12.960
very fun. The thing with DC Universe that I was skeptical about is it's yet another

20:12.960 --> 20:19.960
superhero MMO. There seems to be a whole lot of those out there these days, but this one

20:19.960 --> 20:28.680
was more action, and you don't really find that in MMOs. It's still the same sort of

20:28.680 --> 20:34.480
World of Warcraft style, you target an enemy and then you stand around and you hit a button

20:34.480 --> 20:38.640
and then you attack, and then you wait, and then you attack again. This one, I was flying

20:38.640 --> 20:43.360
around, running around, jumping, bashing things in the head, freezing them. It was really

20:43.360 --> 20:47.920
fun. Yeah, I loved the fact that it was a little more action-based, and the demo we

20:47.920 --> 20:52.120
had to play was a PvP demo, and it was really cool. The guy that was demoing it was showing

20:52.120 --> 20:56.040
us all these tricks, and I gotta say, you know, it was kind of like Phantasy Star Online,

20:56.040 --> 21:00.880
but on speed to me, because when I think action MMOs, there's not a lot I've really played

21:00.880 --> 21:05.120
except for Phantasy Star Online and Phantasy Star Universe, but it was kind of like that,

21:05.120 --> 21:10.680
but really fast-paced, and then kind of with that Warcraft twist where you do have bars

21:10.680 --> 21:14.920
full of spells and things that you could use. So I'm curious to see kind of what the single-player

21:14.920 --> 21:18.520
mode looks like. I will tell you one little tidbit we picked up on, though. I don't know

21:18.520 --> 21:23.800
if this is out there completely yet, but the PlayStation 3 and the PC versions are not

21:23.800 --> 21:29.560
gonna play together like a lot of people speculated they will, at least initially. I get the feeling

21:29.560 --> 21:34.800
from the little demo we had that that's something that they might want to try to add in later.

21:34.800 --> 21:39.200
I think the developers kind of think they can pull it off, but I think it's also kind

21:39.200 --> 21:42.720
of like, I guess, they, you know, have other balancing things and, you know, because it's

21:42.720 --> 21:46.600
two different systems or what have you. So if one of you was gonna get that on PS3 and

21:46.600 --> 21:50.640
the other was on PC, do note you can't play together right off the bat, so I think that's

21:50.640 --> 21:55.200
something a lot of folks are gonna want to take into consideration, yeah? So, cool, DC

21:55.200 --> 21:59.080
Universe. When's that out? That was out, what, November 2nd, I think they said? All right,

21:59.080 --> 22:05.320
how about Dead Rising 2, Shane? Let me preface this with I am scared to death of zombies

22:05.320 --> 22:12.600
and the like, and I decided to, you know, face my fears, play some Dead Rising 2. The

22:12.600 --> 22:17.840
game is really fun, very hilarious. I, what's his name, Chuck Green, I think, is the main

22:17.840 --> 22:23.040
character you play as. Definitely dressed him up in some women's clothing, gave him

22:23.040 --> 22:28.720
a nice little hat. At one point, I picked up a big stuffed pink elephant bear thing

22:28.720 --> 22:35.720
and started hitting zombies with it. Saw some very hilarious gory moments, like some sort

22:36.840 --> 22:43.840
of like lawnmower device just chewing up zombies and, oh, it was great. I had a really good

22:43.840 --> 22:48.240
time. I actually think I want to get this game now, too. I gotta admit, it did look

22:48.240 --> 22:53.520
a little like more of the same with the first one to me, but, you know, but upgraded in

22:53.520 --> 22:57.760
the way that sequels should be upgraded, you know, it was a little more camp in some ways,

22:57.760 --> 23:01.540
which I think is what everybody really appreciated about the first game and, you know, the main

23:01.540 --> 23:05.720
character that they have now definitely seemed likable enough and, you know, I think people

23:05.720 --> 23:09.720
are gonna get a kick out of the environment, especially, I think the whole like Vegas-y,

23:09.720 --> 23:12.820
you know, what a fortune city or whatever they're calling it, the Vegas-like environment,

23:12.820 --> 23:17.000
I think a lot of people are really gonna get a kick out of. LittleBigPlanet2, Shane, tell

23:17.000 --> 23:20.040
me a little bit about what we did in that game, LittleBigPlanet2.

23:20.040 --> 23:26.480
The level they gave us was somewhat of a race level, trying to reach the top before the

23:26.480 --> 23:33.480
time limit. We failed, but it still let us keep going. I can't remember a game that had

23:33.600 --> 23:39.600
made me smile and laugh so much while I was playing. It's really got a charm about it

23:39.600 --> 23:44.400
that just makes you want to play more, which sucked because the demo, to me, felt so short,

23:44.400 --> 23:47.480
but I know we were playing that thing for like five minutes at least.

23:47.480 --> 23:52.320
Yeah, I think one important thing to note is that, you know, it really did kind of just

23:52.320 --> 23:55.600
look and felt like the first game, you know, speaking of kind of, you know, games that

23:55.600 --> 24:00.160
are more of the same, but you guys all know that the big innovation in LittleBigPlanet2

24:00.160 --> 24:04.580
is kind of what they're letting you do now, you know, the expansion of the creation engine,

24:04.580 --> 24:07.880
which is, you know, really the biggest part, and the part Shane left out about the race

24:07.880 --> 24:12.380
is it was all about grappling hooks, and the part of what made it really funny is that,

24:12.380 --> 24:15.600
you know, if Shane would be kind of like trying to grab on to something, I could actually

24:15.600 --> 24:19.980
use my grappling hook to grab on to him, and it would kind of like, like the physics was

24:19.980 --> 24:23.580
really good, I thought, and that was, you know, kind of the impressive part of the demo

24:23.580 --> 24:28.840
is that they got the physics kind of, of all that complicated grappling and grappling mat

24:28.840 --> 24:34.640
type of stuff down, so good times. So LittleBigPlanet2, I mean, I think a lot of you guys, like the

24:34.640 --> 24:39.600
first one, are probably already going to check that out, and rightfully so. Tron, I played

24:39.600 --> 24:44.160
the new Tron game, Tron Evolution, I believe it's called, on the 360, actually the version

24:44.160 --> 24:49.740
I played is the PS3, but, you know, same same. Okay guys, it's Tron meets Prince of Persia,

24:49.740 --> 24:53.840
like that's really what it felt like to me, you have the running up and wall jumping that

24:53.840 --> 24:58.560
you do, and like seriously, the tutorial stage felt almost just like that first Prince of

24:58.560 --> 25:03.200
Persia tutorial stage. The battle mechanics though, of course, are a lot different because,

25:03.200 --> 25:08.560
you know, you're not really using a sword. The battle almost felt a little more like

25:08.560 --> 25:12.360
Bayonetta to me, because like I could just practically button mash and do all this cool

25:12.360 --> 25:17.720
shit, and there was like bullet time and all this, you know, kind of crazy stuff. The graphics

25:17.720 --> 25:24.640
were simple, but that's what Tron's supposed to be, it's very true to the movie. It was

25:24.640 --> 25:29.000
kind of hard for me to hear in the tunnel that they had, they had Tron in this big neon

25:29.000 --> 25:33.120
kind of tunnel looking thing, it was a very, very cool setup, props to them, whoever designed

25:33.120 --> 25:38.240
that booth. But, you know, it's very loud in there, but it sounded like the music I

25:38.240 --> 25:42.880
could hear was kind of a repeat of the Daft Punk score that's supposed to be in the movie

25:42.880 --> 25:47.640
and the music sounded like it was really good. Again, I'm kind of evaluating that on a very

25:47.640 --> 25:54.240
quick demo and what I think I heard. But hopefully, a lot of the cool score will carry over. I

25:54.240 --> 25:57.400
did have fun with it, I thought for an actiony game, it was it was a pretty cool little button

25:57.400 --> 26:02.220
masher and it's Tron. Now, Shane, you don't even like know the Tron movie or what have

26:02.220 --> 26:07.800
you, so did this game do anything for you? I know you just watched me play, but...

26:07.800 --> 26:14.640
To be honest, not really. It seemed really bland. The graphics weren't that great, especially

26:14.640 --> 26:18.680
considering the Wii one was right next to it, and it's kind of hard to tell the difference

26:18.680 --> 26:26.200
between the two. And the environments were just really, really dull. It was a whole bunch

26:26.200 --> 26:33.040
of black, blue, which, shockingly, you'd think I'd like, but it didn't look like a lot of

26:33.040 --> 26:37.480
effort had been put into making the game. But that also might be the way the Tron series

26:37.480 --> 26:43.040
is, but that doesn't translate well for a big, flashy video game.

26:43.040 --> 26:46.240
Now see, I could tell the difference right away between the Xbox and the Wii one. Well,

26:46.240 --> 26:50.240
for one, the Wii was all the light cycle racing, and I guess there's some of that in the PS3

26:50.240 --> 26:56.240
one as well, but I don't know. It definitely looks sharper to me. I don't know with Shane

26:56.240 --> 27:02.120
smoking, I think it'll be fine. But I guess, you know, if you don't know Tron at home listening,

27:02.120 --> 27:04.840
then you're probably going to kind of look at this the same way. But for those of you

27:04.840 --> 27:08.800
that are fans of Tron, like me, you're going to go like, oh, that's cool, because you throw

27:08.800 --> 27:14.600
discs all over and doing these hops and bullet times and, woo, special effects.

27:14.600 --> 27:19.840
Epic Mickey. We kind of had to watch one of the Disney employees play this, but we definitely

27:19.840 --> 27:23.400
saw quite a bit of this game. Shane, what did you think of Epic Mickey?

27:23.400 --> 27:31.040
It looked like a really solid platformer style game. I think the thing that interested me

27:31.040 --> 27:38.720
the most, which is the one thing we didn't see a lot of, was the ability to erase and

27:38.720 --> 27:51.240
regenerate certain aspects of stages. I did like the open-ended, not open-ended, but the

27:51.240 --> 27:57.320
almost free-roaming little, what we saw, kind of tiki hut, is that what it's called? Yeah,

27:57.320 --> 28:03.120
that section. The 2D was okay. I think that was probably my least favorite, but it looked

28:03.120 --> 28:05.720
like a pretty interesting game.

28:05.720 --> 28:09.000
I personally thought the 2D stuff looked kind of cool. It kind of looked like what maybe

28:09.000 --> 28:12.800
you'd see on an Xbox Live arcade game or something, which was something, because the graphics

28:12.800 --> 28:15.400
on the Wii were really good. Bobby wants to jump in on Epic Mickey.

28:15.400 --> 28:22.480
Because I played it. Oh, yeah. That's right. Mickey is epic. I didn't play any of the 2D

28:22.480 --> 28:25.480
stages. I played because there was another guy that was there that did the first part

28:25.480 --> 28:30.260
of the demo, and I'm like, I'll just continue from here, because he had to run. But I battled

28:30.260 --> 28:38.560
some enemies and stuff. Basically, it's kind of funny. Mickey can't directly hurt the enemies,

28:38.560 --> 28:45.880
really. Basically, you've got your paint and your thinner. And basically, if you throw

28:45.880 --> 28:50.240
enough paint at an enemy, it becomes your friend and starts fighting for you, kind of

28:50.240 --> 28:56.240
like minions in Overlord and stuff. And I think if you do enough thinner at them, then

28:56.240 --> 29:00.360
they go away and stuff. But there's actually some other things you can pick up. Like one

29:00.360 --> 29:07.080
of the things that I did was pick up a special item that was a TV. And in order to distract

29:07.080 --> 29:11.720
the guard, you threw the TV at him, and so he sits on his bucket and starts watching

29:11.720 --> 29:16.040
Steamboat Willie on the TV. And then you can get around him and then basically take him

29:16.040 --> 29:21.320
out, because there's this boat that needs to be risen, and so you need to get rid of

29:21.320 --> 29:25.520
the anchors that are holding it down. And with the thinner, but you need to get in there.

29:25.520 --> 29:30.840
So there's some puzzle elements. And then it wasn't really a boss, but it was a harder

29:30.840 --> 29:38.160
enemy. Essentially, it has a can of paint in it, and it paints its own shell. So basically,

29:38.160 --> 29:42.160
you fire paint at it to slow it down, and then you fire thinner at it to get rid of

29:42.160 --> 29:46.800
its shell, and then he's got a weak spot that you hit for massive damage. And if you hit

29:46.800 --> 29:54.800
this weak spot three times, then you beat him. And you can also have other of your friends

29:54.800 --> 29:59.500
help him. And if you actually turn somebody to your side that has a can of thinner on

29:59.500 --> 30:05.040
them, then they will, if they're your friend, they will throw thinner on the enemies and

30:05.040 --> 30:09.000
hurt them and stuff. So it was really neat the way that they did it, and it looks really

30:09.000 --> 30:14.320
good. It's very smooth and stuff, and it's still an early build. But I had a lot of fun

30:14.320 --> 30:19.660
with it, and it looks like they are, because the guy told me War Inspector is a huge Disney

30:19.660 --> 30:24.660
fanatic, especially of the older stuff, which is why the Steamboat Willie stuff is in there.

30:24.660 --> 30:28.800
So he's really big on capturing the essence of Disney.

30:28.800 --> 30:34.640
You know what really surprised me, though, just not knowing the old Disney as well as

30:34.640 --> 30:39.920
the contemporary stuff? I was really surprised at how devious they let Mickey be in some

30:39.920 --> 30:44.420
parts. I don't know if you saw the part with the tiki masks, but in the very beginning,

30:44.420 --> 30:49.440
there's a little quest that Mickey's given to go get tiki masks. And what he can do,

30:49.440 --> 30:54.520
he can go get the three masks and turn them in to the shopkeeper, and the shopkeeper will

30:54.520 --> 30:59.840
reward him. Or what you can do, you find one mask, you give it to the shopkeeper, and then

30:59.840 --> 31:04.560
the shopkeeper puts it in the back. Well, if you go walk around to the back of the building,

31:04.560 --> 31:09.160
use paint thinner on the building, you can walk in the back door, take that mask, go

31:09.160 --> 31:14.440
back out and give it back to him, and say, I found another mask. And I was kind of like,

31:14.440 --> 31:18.000
it just kind of struck me as odd. I was always kind of like, I would have thought that, you

31:18.000 --> 31:24.960
know, Von Disney would never let folks kind of portray Mickey in a negative light like

31:24.960 --> 31:28.720
that. And his conscience or whatever, Gus or whatever that's kind of following around

31:28.720 --> 31:33.440
is like, wow, I'm surprised you do that, Mickey. But it kind of makes him more bad. And you

31:33.440 --> 31:36.760
could kind of see that because his his paint would be wearing off. And that's why he kind

31:36.760 --> 31:40.120
of has that drippy look is because he had paint thinner. So I was kind of surprised

31:40.120 --> 31:44.160
that you could kind of play it a little devious that Mickey didn't necessarily have to be

31:44.160 --> 31:48.840
all good. I thought to me, that's the most fascinating part of Epic Mickey is the fact

31:48.840 --> 31:52.940
that you can kind of play different ways. I really like games to let you do that. It's

31:52.940 --> 31:56.920
very fable. I guess you could say, you know, you think your game kind of changes depending

31:56.920 --> 32:02.100
on if you want to be good or bad. So yeah, Epic Mickey, very cool. A couple of DS games

32:02.100 --> 32:05.680
that I know you checked out, Shane, I didn't get to spend a lot of time with these, but

32:05.680 --> 32:08.120
Super Scribblenauts and the new Professor Layton.

32:08.120 --> 32:14.240
Yeah, um, to be honest, I was not going to play Super Scribblenauts. It was an accident

32:14.240 --> 32:19.440
thinking I was going to go play a different game. But I'm glad I did because I somewhat

32:19.440 --> 32:25.060
liked the first Scribblenauts game. Like everyone had a problem with the controls. And I always

32:25.060 --> 32:34.000
relied on anvils and laser guns to get through all the stages. But the nice lady at the demo

32:34.000 --> 32:39.880
station was showing me just some of the stuff I could do. She's like, put whatever you want.

32:39.880 --> 32:45.120
I was like, well, I don't know what to put. She's like, well, try, you know, big purple

32:45.120 --> 32:50.900
pregnant dragon. I'm like, that's ridiculous. So okay. And sure enough, big dragon comes

32:50.900 --> 32:57.320
out, has a little baby dragon. Like, what the crap? She's like, okay, go back and put

32:57.320 --> 33:01.240
friendly in there somewhere. So I did that. And then the dragons fought each other. It's

33:01.240 --> 33:09.620
like, okay, that's pretty cool. So with the controls being vastly improved and the inclusion

33:09.620 --> 33:16.200
of adjectives, it actually looks like a really, really fun game. The other game I played was

33:16.200 --> 33:22.840
Professor Layton Unwound Future or something like that. I don't remember exactly what it's

33:22.840 --> 33:27.880
called. Newest Professor Layton game that's coming out this September, apparently. It's

33:27.880 --> 33:34.360
Professor Layton. That's all you really need to know. It's fun. The one puzzle I did kind

33:34.360 --> 33:38.760
of stumped me a little bit. Then the rep helped me out. So I felt really dumb because I actually

33:38.760 --> 33:45.300
had it figured out. I just was too chicken to pick the wrong answer. I guess there's

33:45.300 --> 33:51.840
a new inclusion to the memo function when you're in a puzzle. You can actually draw

33:51.840 --> 33:56.800
in different colors and you can erase with an erase tool instead of just clearing the

33:56.800 --> 34:05.280
entire thing, which is very handy. Both of those games, once again, I'm looking forward

34:05.280 --> 34:10.120
to. I definitely will get Professor Layton. Scribblenauts is now on my list of things

34:10.120 --> 34:14.320
I definitely will consider getting.

34:14.320 --> 34:17.160
Since I've got to step it up and get through the rest of these games faster so we can actually

34:17.160 --> 34:20.400
get to bed, do you want to describe Ghost Trick real quick, too? I know this is from

34:20.400 --> 34:22.040
the guy who did Phoenix Wright.

34:22.040 --> 34:29.560
Yeah, it's a game where you're a ghost and you have to manipulate objects to alter characters'

34:29.560 --> 34:40.040
fate. They're fate because usually the characters die. At least they did in the demo. It's more

34:40.040 --> 34:48.160
puzzle than anything else. Really interesting graphic style. The demo stumped me. I kind

34:48.160 --> 34:54.000
of think I'm going to go back at some point tomorrow and try to beat it. It looks like

34:54.000 --> 34:58.280
another brain teaser with lots of thinking involved from the same people that did Phoenix

34:58.280 --> 35:00.640
Wright.

35:00.640 --> 35:03.540
While he was playing some of those games, I actually checked out Goldeneye. The new

35:03.540 --> 35:06.640
Goldeneye game is actually on the floor. It's kind of hard to find because Activision doesn't

35:06.640 --> 35:11.960
have a booth, but Nintendo has it at their booth, only in a couple places. I got to fess

35:11.960 --> 35:16.040
up, guys. If you've listened to O.L.R. a long time, you may already know this, but I never

35:16.040 --> 35:21.560
really played Goldeneye 64. I didn't have Nintendo 64 until very late, so I never really

35:21.560 --> 35:28.760
got into the craze until a little later. Playing this on the Wii was cool because it reminded

35:28.760 --> 35:34.160
me of an old school shooter game. I get the sense that they have really just ported a

35:34.160 --> 35:38.600
lot of the old game with new graphics. I suppose they were saying new stages and things too.

35:38.600 --> 35:42.920
It's not just a copy of the old game. They want to make that very clear. It's new stuff

35:42.920 --> 35:48.640
as well, not just Daniel Craig now. We were fighting multiplayer level and I was odd job

35:48.640 --> 35:52.840
and I could throw my hat and stuff. It definitely reminded me of one of those old school arcade

35:52.840 --> 35:59.480
shooters, very much like Perfect Dark, obviously, the connection between those games. Very interesting

35:59.480 --> 36:05.280
that Activision is taking this over now. I know you only saw the game briefly, Shane,

36:05.280 --> 36:11.160
Goldeneye, but did you notice anything lost in translation or anything? To me, it made

36:11.160 --> 36:16.800
a very seamless transition from being a rare game to whoever is developing it now.

36:16.800 --> 36:22.440
The only thing I noticed besides graphics that was a bit different, and this could just

36:22.440 --> 36:27.480
be my memory being a little bit hazy, but I do not remember the ability to climb on

36:27.480 --> 36:35.640
boxes and stuff like that, which was present in the demo we played. Otherwise, it looked

36:35.640 --> 36:44.320
like a pretty faithful port of the Nintendo 64 with some updated features.

36:44.320 --> 36:47.320
I think there will be a lot of people listening to this that are going to be into that. I

36:47.320 --> 36:50.840
think about Bresloh and his love for Perfect Dark, I think a game like this will be right

36:50.840 --> 36:54.880
up his alley. Quickly talking about some of the other games, we quickly got to observe

36:54.880 --> 37:00.840
the Castlevania Xbox Live arcade game, heavily influenced by Symphony of the Night. Lots

37:00.840 --> 37:05.880
of zoom ins and outs on the different stages. It looks like you have 10 minutes, and you

37:05.880 --> 37:11.920
can cooperatively or combatively, I guess you could say, against each other go after

37:11.920 --> 37:17.320
the boss, but these stages seem to be very large, and you make your way towards the boss.

37:17.320 --> 37:23.720
There is only really one stage in the demo that we could see, but it looked interesting.

37:23.720 --> 37:26.920
I think because it is in the same vein as Symphony of the Night, it could be a lot of

37:26.920 --> 37:31.040
fun, but it doesn't look like, and maybe I should have asked this, but it doesn't look

37:31.040 --> 37:35.800
like there is a lot of single player stuff. Although, I imagine there might be time trials,

37:35.800 --> 37:40.400
things of that nature. We didn't get to dig too deep into this game, but Shane, anything

37:40.400 --> 37:44.760
from your quick impressions of the Castlevania Xbox Live game? Harmony of Despair, I think

37:44.760 --> 37:51.160
it is? I think it looks like crap. I don't like the premise. Graphically, they could

37:51.160 --> 37:56.120
have cleaned it up a little bit. The guys we watched playing it clearly did not know

37:56.120 --> 38:03.120
what they were doing, but the game also didn't seem to really give you much direction. I

38:03.120 --> 38:08.320
don't know. I don't think it is something that they should have attempted. I might give

38:08.320 --> 38:11.760
it a shot later on, but it definitely kind of has that Neo Geo effect with all the zoom

38:11.760 --> 38:16.080
ins and outs, but I thought it looked good, and I am a fan of anything inspired by Symphony

38:16.080 --> 38:21.160
of the Night, so I don't know Shane. You might want to give it a chance later. Here is a

38:21.160 --> 38:26.800
game I am giving no chance at all. Saw 2. God, I watched Shane play the demo. If you

38:26.800 --> 38:32.440
are eating something, you might want to pause this for a minute. In the very opening scene

38:32.440 --> 38:37.400
of the demo, I think parodying a scene in the second movie, I have never seen it, but

38:37.400 --> 38:41.960
I have heard about it, where the guy has to basically cut open his eye. Oh, God, it is

38:41.960 --> 38:48.720
so gross. Were you doing that with the controller, actually cutting the eye? It was like, oh,

38:48.720 --> 38:55.720
this is so disgusting. Shane, you described the demo as bleh. I had said when I saw the

38:57.000 --> 39:01.680
Saw 2 game, I did not want to play the part where you cut open your eye, and of course

39:01.680 --> 39:08.120
that is the first thing you do in the game, so I had to do it. Grossed me the heck out,

39:08.120 --> 39:12.640
but much like the first Saw game, the game is really about puzzles and trying to figure

39:12.640 --> 39:19.640
out stuff. I love it. It is kind of my replacement, or not my replacement, but just something

39:23.220 --> 39:27.160
to get me through the time when we do not have Silent Hill, because it is still kind

39:27.160 --> 39:34.160
of scary and it has got the nice atmosphere. It is very gory, and if you are at all squeamish,

39:34.160 --> 39:41.160
I saw so many different things die during the five minutes I played of the demo, and

39:42.300 --> 39:47.820
only one of them was me, thankfully. The rest were cut little flashbacks to people getting

39:47.820 --> 39:54.820
impaled, sliced with a buzzsaw, all sorts of fun things. But yeah, it felt like a pretty

39:54.820 --> 40:01.820
good game again, and I cannot wait for it to come out, but it is really gross.

40:04.700 --> 40:09.700
That is the game I should show to my mother. These are what video games are, mom. Do not

40:09.700 --> 40:15.540
you love these? Alright, here is a game my mom would like, but I would never understand

40:15.540 --> 40:26.220
why. Glee Karaoke Revolution. Basically, it is Karaoke Revolution. It is the little bars

40:26.220 --> 40:31.960
along the bottom that move with the pitch, and all the videos are Glee. So there is really

40:31.960 --> 40:38.960
no interface in the game itself, besides just the little pitch bars and a very light shell

40:38.960 --> 40:45.480
around that. There are no characters anymore. If you remember in Karaoke Revolution, you

40:45.480 --> 40:49.200
would have these venues and things. No, you do not really have that anymore. It is just

40:49.200 --> 40:54.560
videos from Glee that only kind of go with the songs, because they will try to show it,

40:54.560 --> 40:58.160
synced up with how it was in the show, but since the songs in the show are shorter, they

40:58.160 --> 41:04.520
will just throw in all these random clips. It was on the Wii, the version we were playing,

41:04.520 --> 41:10.760
so the video quality was kind of poop. I watched Glee in HD at home when I was watching the

41:10.760 --> 41:16.760
first few episodes, and I just thought the game was just kind of... I was barely singing

41:16.760 --> 41:22.480
the song, and I got like five stars. Now granted, I was on the lowest difficulty, and it was

41:22.480 --> 41:27.360
probably dumbed down because it was a demo, blah blah blah, but I just, I do not know.

41:27.360 --> 41:31.760
I guess for the hardcore Glee fans, they will be all over it, but I just thought it was,

41:31.760 --> 41:35.200
it is kind of one of those things where as you make a copy of a copy of a copy of a copy,

41:35.200 --> 41:39.000
it starts to wear down a little bit, and that is kind of where I was at with Glee Karaoke

41:39.000 --> 41:42.540
Revolution. I mean, it is a cute license idea. I mean, it is kind of one of those things

41:42.540 --> 41:45.000
where once we saw it, it is like, oh yeah, of course, of course there was going to be

41:45.000 --> 41:52.220
a Glee game. Shane, were your thoughts different? Nope. I also thought it was pretty terrible.

41:52.220 --> 41:57.040
My problem with it is, and this is the same thing that has happened before, is that Konami

41:57.040 --> 42:05.760
buys rights to a very, very popular IP and then does not put any effort into it, thinking

42:05.760 --> 42:11.800
that the brand name will sell itself. Unfortunately, as we learned with the American Idol Karaoke

42:11.800 --> 42:19.720
Revolution games, that is not going to work, and this is a very, very good opportunity

42:19.720 --> 42:25.360
to make some money, but they just need to invest a little more because right now, I

42:25.360 --> 42:30.160
do not see any potential in the game. The sad thing is though, Shane, I think it is

42:30.160 --> 42:33.200
going to sell very well because I think there will be a lot of teenage girls that are like,

42:33.200 --> 42:36.780
I love Glee, and they will buy the game on the Wii, and they do not look for the same

42:36.780 --> 42:40.800
stuff we do. So I think you kind of have to take Shane and I's impressions of the game

42:40.800 --> 42:44.320
with a big grain of salt. I think the game will still do really well. It is just not

42:44.320 --> 42:51.040
going to do well with people listening to or recording video game podcasts about other

42:51.040 --> 42:55.680
types of games, you know what I mean? There is an audience for this that is just not us.

42:55.680 --> 43:02.440
Well, as someone who is a huge fan of Glee and has bought all five CDs, on the day they

43:02.440 --> 43:10.200
came out, no less, each one of them, all I would need is just a few minor tweaks to the

43:10.200 --> 43:20.160
interface, and I would actually be fine with, for the most part, what we saw. It just does

43:20.160 --> 43:26.720
not feel like it is anywhere near done. I actually hope that is the case.

43:26.720 --> 43:30.240
All right, just a couple of quick ones. We will kind of wrap up talking about what was

43:30.240 --> 43:35.960
at Sega's booth and some of the things we saw there. Sonic 4, Episode 1. I think it

43:35.960 --> 43:39.840
is pretty much what all of you are expecting. It looks like the old Sonic games, but with

43:39.840 --> 43:44.980
HD graphics, that is really what it is. I mean, what else can you say about it? Either

43:44.980 --> 43:48.320
you have played the old games or you have not. I do not know, did you notice any minor

43:48.320 --> 43:54.200
tweaks that I might be overlooking, Shane? When I played it, it really did feel like

43:54.200 --> 43:59.320
Sonic. His animations are a little slow at the moment, but I overheard them saying that

43:59.320 --> 44:06.160
they were going to fix that. The boss fight felt a little more complex than what I was

44:06.160 --> 44:13.080
used to from a Sonic game of that quality, so I am pleased. I cannot wait for it to come

44:13.080 --> 44:17.120
out. I also overheard them talk about, well, we

44:17.120 --> 44:21.200
had to take all of this into evaluation and listen to the fans. They wanted Sonic to be

44:21.200 --> 44:26.760
able to accelerate faster from walking to running and all that stuff. I was just kind

44:26.760 --> 44:31.200
of like, okay, yes, that is great, but I think on most people, sadly, that type of effort

44:31.200 --> 44:33.520
will probably be lost because I think a lot of people are going to have that same type

44:33.520 --> 44:38.040
of reaction where it is like, oh, hey, it is Sonic 2, but HD. That is not a bad thing.

44:38.040 --> 44:40.760
Old Sonic games were when they were really the best.

44:40.760 --> 44:48.160
Alright, Phantasy Star Portable 2. I do not know. It was pretty much just like the first

44:48.160 --> 44:51.200
one to me. I did not get to ask a lot of questions on that. I really wanted to see if the pizza

44:51.200 --> 44:56.320
box was still there. I do not know, Shane. Did you notice anything different, really,

44:56.320 --> 45:03.240
except not being able to skip cut scenes? The only addition that they have really made,

45:03.240 --> 45:09.300
it seems, is the ability to roll around and dodge, which, you know, if you were like me

45:09.300 --> 45:14.280
and download the Japanese trial, you already knew that. Otherwise, it is pretty much the

45:14.280 --> 45:22.440
same game. From what I understand, they had somewhat famous, I think, manga or anime artists

45:22.440 --> 45:27.360
in Japan do the new character designs. They need to never do that again because they have

45:27.360 --> 45:30.960
made the characters worse looking.

45:30.960 --> 45:33.860
Are not a lot of the characters just kind of copied from old games because I swear that

45:33.860 --> 45:37.480
shark you were fighting in the very beginning was like the same damn thing that was in the

45:37.480 --> 45:40.420
Dreamcast PSO.

45:40.420 --> 45:45.840
Those are completely different. I am talking about the characters you can create yourself.

45:45.840 --> 45:54.560
They changed the faces. They changed the costumes. It does not look nearly as good, I think.

45:54.560 --> 45:58.120
Really your character looked kind of cool to me, at least the one I saw. I did not think

45:58.120 --> 46:00.840
it was terrible.

46:00.840 --> 46:06.440
After spending a lot of time with the character creator in the first game, to me, I noticed

46:06.440 --> 46:09.880
how bad. It is really the faces. The faces look really terrible.

46:09.880 --> 46:15.640
I guess we will close out today with a game I know Bobby had wanted to say something to

46:15.640 --> 46:21.640
on at some point. This is also at Sega's booth. Sega was also showing off some iPads. One

46:21.640 --> 46:27.360
of the iPads had Super Monkey Ball 2 on the iPad. I think all of us got a chance to touch

46:27.360 --> 46:28.360
that game.

46:28.360 --> 46:32.200
Shane, we will start with you. What do you think of Super Monkey Ball 2 on the iPad?

46:32.200 --> 46:40.760
The theme for tonight is, I guess, I hated it. It just controlled like crap. Seriously,

46:40.760 --> 46:46.400
my iPhone plays Monkey Ball better than that iPad demo that they had, so I am not impressed.

46:46.400 --> 46:51.480
Not making me want to buy an iPad. Not making me want to download another Monkey Ball game.

46:51.480 --> 46:55.720
Bobby, was the demo lost on YouTube?

46:55.720 --> 46:59.180
It is shit.

46:59.180 --> 47:03.660
You know, I got the controls pretty quick. It is just that little device was calibrated

47:03.660 --> 47:10.380
weird. At the end of the day, I was like, yeah, Monkey Ball was better a long time ago.

47:10.380 --> 47:11.880
I think this one is going to be a pass.

47:11.880 --> 47:16.840
There you go. I guess we are going to go ahead and wrap up for the night. We are ready to

47:16.840 --> 47:21.400
go to bed. God, it is already 1.30 and I still have to get this uplifted. Thanks for staying

47:21.400 --> 47:26.160
up with us or whatever time of day it is where you are and listening to the little wrap up

47:26.160 --> 47:27.160
today.

47:27.160 --> 47:30.600
We will probably do another quick one tomorrow. It probably will not be super long because

47:30.600 --> 47:35.280
I know Bobby has to fly out to Atlanta and all that stuff. Tomorrow, we will try to give

47:35.280 --> 47:41.000
you some final impressions. Our most favorite thing we have seen at the show we will get

47:41.000 --> 47:45.520
to tomorrow. I know we are going to be seeing Final Fantasy XIV tomorrow. I am really hoping

47:45.520 --> 47:49.360
to make it to Civ V. Actually, I am supposed to have some time to sit down with Civilization

47:49.360 --> 47:53.280
V. It is actually exciting. I know Bobby is going to finally get to see Rock Band 3 tomorrow.

47:53.280 --> 47:56.680
So we will have more stuff to talk about tomorrow. Again, if you have questions, feedback, whatever

47:56.680 --> 48:01.680
Twitter is the best way to get us on the show floor. I actually did get some requests to

48:01.680 --> 48:08.800
see things today that I took pictures of. There was NHL 11. Kirby's Epic Yarn I need

48:08.800 --> 48:12.320
to get tomorrow again. I already put one picture up but somebody wanted to know more about

48:12.320 --> 48:16.240
it. I will try to get that for impressions tomorrow. I am seeing the stuff on Twitter

48:16.240 --> 48:23.600
guys so keep sending those. Twitter.com slash OLR. Any closing thoughts for the night, Bobby?

48:23.600 --> 48:29.840
Monkey Ball and iPad is shit. Sounds good. Any closing thoughts for tonight, Shane?

48:29.840 --> 48:35.920
I can't wait to live at the Final Fantasy XIV booth tomorrow and never leave it. Alright

48:35.920 --> 48:42.280
guys, I guess my final thought is it is time to get this uploaded and go to bed. Cheesecake

48:42.280 --> 48:46.800
is delicious just for the record. It is very good. Okay, have a good night everybody. We

48:46.800 --> 48:50.760
will see you tomorrow with another Rob Roberts special here on the Orange Lounge Radio feed.

48:50.760 --> 48:55.760
Good night.
