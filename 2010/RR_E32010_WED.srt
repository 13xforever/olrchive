00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,920
Hi everybody, it's Rob Roberts again here at E3 for a little special show for our feed

2
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:10,920
here.

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,920
Rob Roberts and Pals at E3.

4
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:18,400
It's the Wednesday edition or the second day of E3 although that's somewhat of a fib because

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,000
it's technically Thursday right now as we tape this.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,420
It's after 1230 in the morning so it's even later than we taped last night but you'll

7
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:29,120
notice my voice at least is doing a little better today so that's a good thing.

8
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,280
So I hopefully won't be straining as bad as I was yesterday.

9
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:36,120
Anyhow, let's get right into the show and talk about some of the things we saw today.

10
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,240
We don't have a lot of news for you guys or anything because I'm sure a lot of you guys

11
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,520
have been reading the different websites.

12
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,920
We talked a lot about what the press conferences were all about yesterday but we just want

13
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,240
to tell you about our perspective on some of the things we tried and some of the things

14
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,240
we got our hands on.

15
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:53,640
I know a lot of our listeners have come to want to know what we think of some of the

16
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,660
games we get to get our hands on.

17
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:59,100
So I'll tell you a little bit about my experience in a little bit but we want to catch up with

18
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:04,440
definitely a pal of Orange Lounge Radio, somebody who's been a supporter of our show for a very

19
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,440
long time.

20
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,440
We try to support him too.

21
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:10,640
The one and only, straight out of Atlanta, Bobby Blackwolf is here.

22
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,040
Woooo, that's me.

23
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,540
How you doing?

24
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:19,960
So I wasn't able to be a part of the show last night because I was getting drunk and

25
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:23,800
attempting to Rick Roll the entire Bethesda party and failed.

26
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,800
It was very terrible.

27
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:29,080
It was the low point of my E3 when they turned off the karaoke at 1am and I was one step

28
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:33,120
the song away from Rick Rolling everybody.

29
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,280
That's my biggest disappointment of E3.

30
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,920
But I do have to throw this in though.

31
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:43,600
He may not have gotten to Rick Roll everybody but if you do want to see his awesome Night

32
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,920
of Fire routine, it's like all over Twitter right now so check that out.

33
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,280
Yeah, we're getting to that.

34
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:58,500
I do want to say that I was a part of the Activision saying, hey we didn't have to pay

35
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:04,320
that bonus to Infinity Ward, let's throw a party event, which was, you've probably read

36
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:10,500
about it and seen it, it's the 6 million dollar party they threw in the Staples Center on

37
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:19,460
Monday night showcasing just four games, DJ Hero 2, Guitar Hero, Warriors of Rock, True

38
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:26,840
Crime Hong Kong, and Call of Duty Black Ops with some cheap performers like Usher and

39
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:35,400
Jane's Addiction and Soundgarden and this guy named Eminem with Rihanna and a stripper.

40
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,960
I love Eminem's.

41
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,600
Yes, I only want the red and black ones.

42
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:45,300
But the highlight obviously was the pole dancer, I'm not going to say stripper because she

43
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:52,680
didn't strip, but the pole dancer, they lowered a pole from the rafters of the Staples Center

44
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:58,200
and she literally went probably about halfway up, which is like to the club seats on this

45
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,640
pole and hanging upside down and all that stuff, she stole the show.

46
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:10,360
So yeah, 6 million dollars and on top of that they gave us free beer.

47
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:14,260
Well clearly they had to bring in a pole dancer because the video game industry is so dominated

48
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,680
by women and gay men.

49
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:25,600
Exactly, but to me that was the biggest F you to the former Infinity Ward guys because

50
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,300
that was probably their bonus that they spent.

51
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:33,100
But hey, let me tell you guys this, you have never witnessed a video game trailer until

52
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:36,840
you see it with full pyrotechnics all around you.

53
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:42,200
The Call of Duty trailer is the same one you've probably seen online except they decided that

54
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,880
it was going to, instead of the music being canned, they actually did have a full orchestra

55
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:51,040
down in the pit playing the music for the trailer because the conductor was up on stage

56
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,040
and I'm like, what is he conducting?

57
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,760
Oh, there's an orchestra down there because that was far in the back.

58
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:59,400
And then like halfway through, you know, just one big pyrotechnic like with explosion on

59
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,680
the screen, pyrotechnics went around and I was like, oh that's cool, they did some pyrotechnics.

60
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,600
And then every explosion for the rest of the trailer had either pyrotechnics or firecrackers

61
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:12,640
from the top and that was the way to experience a trailer.

62
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,840
I'm still not going to play Call of Duty Black Ops.

63
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,980
Is it possible that maybe they didn't just do it as like kind of like, you know, spend

64
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:22,520
all that bonus money that, you know, they were supposed to pay out but that maybe they

65
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:26,400
sold the booth on eBay as well because I noticed their booth is nowhere to be found.

66
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,680
So I think maybe they sold all the parts of the booth and that may be paid for like the

67
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,720
Dom PÃ©rignon that Eminem needed backstage.

68
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,800
Yeah, probably.

69
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,800
They do have a presence.

70
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,240
I mean they've got a place.

71
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,560
They've got some meeting rooms.

72
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,280
Basically what they're doing is that, you know, by appointment you can go in and basically

73
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,840
they have these little rooms where you get a 30-minute demo of the game and sometimes

74
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,700
hands-on and that's where they're showing all their games.

75
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:56,840
But it's by appointment only and they like it a lot better because it's not as hectic

76
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,440
and loud and stuff.

77
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:03,680
So I did get to actually go in and see Guitar Hero, Warriors of Rock.

78
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,960
I have not been able to see Rock Band yet so don't ask me which one's better.

79
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,360
But you know, kind of going into games and this is, you know, this was actually one of

80
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,040
the most recent things I saw as well.

81
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:19,800
It's Guitar Hero but they showed us the Quest Mode which is, it's not Career Mode, it's

82
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:25,040
Quest Mode now and it actually brings a little bit of, you know, it gives you a different

83
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:29,280
reason to go through the song list other than I want to unlock all these songs.

84
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,160
And then they showed the Quick Play Plus Mode which to me kind of scratched my eye because

85
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,440
they said, yeah, we added so much stuff we couldn't call it Quick Play.

86
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:40,440
If you've played Guitar Hero 5 or Band Hero, you know about those challenges.

87
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:45,280
That's what they added to Quick Play was all those challenges and you can also compete

88
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,760
against the score of a friend kind of like in Geometry Wars where you can select a friend's

89
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:54,640
score off of the leaderboard and then it will show you how close you are to his score.

90
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:59,160
And then you can send him a message on Xbox Live making fun of him because you just beat

91
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,160
his score.

92
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,240
Will I be able to spam his Twitter and his Facebook and everything else too?

93
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,320
No, I think it is just OS, they've said it was just OS messages.

94
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:14,020
So it's, you know, you receive an Xbox Live message, kind of like what I get from Spazinator

95
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:19,520
in some games that, you know, he beat my high score in something.

96
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,780
Or the ones I love is that, you know, so and so wants to play Modern Warfare 2 with you

97
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:25,260
and I'm like, okay, do you listen to OLR?

98
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,920
Like I just, no disrespect to those games.

99
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:33,080
I understand why they have an audience and so forth, but it's just out of the literally,

100
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:36,560
and especially being at this show this year, literally hundreds of games that are available

101
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,120
to play that's just not, you know, high in my queue, you know, but it's just funny that

102
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,140
I get those invites once in a while.

103
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:47,120
So yeah, so that's Guitar Hero.

104
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,920
The one you were referencing earlier that I've played was Dance Masters from Konami

105
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:58,240
which broke my Kinect virginity because unfortunately, see what I've been doing, I've been working

106
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,760
with E3coverage.com and we do a lot of interviews and stuff.

107
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:07,580
So when we go into appointments, it's not really about for, you know, for game tactics,

108
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:12,240
for Justin Lee who's the editor of Game Tactics, it's not really about seeing the games, it's

109
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,080
about getting the interviews.

110
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,680
So we had an hour long Microsoft appointment and didn't see a single game because they

111
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:25,040
brought in like, since it's also a Canadian site, they brought up like the Xbox Live manager

112
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:31,280
for Canada and we interviewed him, the hardware manager for Canada and some, you know, basically

113
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,000
a lot of, you know, and you know, general people about Xbox in Canada and that was the

114
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,560
entire hour was standing up there.

115
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:43,560
So I didn't get to really play Kinect except in the Konami booth and I'm a sea dancer is

116
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,220
what it said.

117
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:49,520
Now one thing I do want to say about it is the menu system, this is what kind of threw

118
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,140
me a little bit, there might be a learning curve for some people because in the menu

119
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:57,440
system for at least Dance Masters which is a third party game, so maybe Microsoft has

120
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,720
it better, it's very sensitive to your movements.

121
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,080
So basically you do the minority report type of thing like, you know, let's, what happened

122
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:10,280
to us is, you know, selecting the difficulty level between light and standard and to hit

123
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:16,160
okay in Dance Masters, you have to put your hand up and then to the right and then, you

124
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,600
know, kind of to touch the okay thing that's at the top right of the screen.

125
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:24,540
Well when I had done it, I had said, okay, we're going to do standard and when I moved

126
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:28,440
my arm up and it's kind of funny, I'm doing this hand motion, I know you can't see it

127
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:33,560
but it's so I can explain it, you're supposed to move your hand up and then to the right.

128
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:37,680
Well when I moved it up, I didn't exactly move it straight up, I went a little bit to

129
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:42,840
the right and as I did that, it moved down to light and then but I had already started

130
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,800
the motion of hitting okay.

131
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,560
So it's going to take a little bit of getting used to, you have to be a little bit more

132
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:52,160
precise than you think and they're going to sit there and say, there's no learning curve

133
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,640
but I think there might be for some people.

134
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:57,840
Well, you know, I had a little hands on time with Dance Masters today too and, you know,

135
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:01,400
I played a song on there too and was going through the menu and what kind of threw me

136
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,940
was that, you know, Natala is supposed to be this whole, you're just going to hold up

137
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:09,240
your hand and wave it around and as you wave it around, you'll be able to select the songs

138
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:13,520
or, you know, whatever it is, change the channels, you know, but I found as I was going through

139
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:17,320
this Dance Masters, it was like, okay, to choose a number of players, you're going to

140
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,200
kind of, you know, put your hand up and then you're going to put it over to the right and

141
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,600
then it was like, okay, change the difficulty, you're going to kind of reach around to left,

142
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,440
it's like, you know, you put your right hand in, you put your right hand out, can I shake

143
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,960
it all about, okay, do the hokey pokey, turn yourself around, you know, it's like, oh my

144
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:33,920
gosh, like maybe it's just there's going to be a natural learning curve with all that

145
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:38,060
stuff and I'm being a little harsh but I was kind of like, gosh, I'm having to dance just

146
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:42,360
to get through the freaking menus on this game and, you know, I'm not really picking

147
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:46,200
on Dance Masters in that regard because it seems like even the other one I had played

148
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:51,160
the other day, Dance Central, maybe didn't have as complex menus because their demo version

149
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:56,000
was very tight and there wasn't a lot to pick from but, you know, it just seems like I'm

150
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,200
worried that in these Kinect games, it's going to be hard to navigate a lot of the menus

151
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:06,400
like it is in iToy. Yeah, I remember that, you know, where you have to like wave your

152
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:12,760
hand over the circle and stuff and yeah. So, but that's the only Kinect experience I've

153
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:17,440
had, I'm probably not going to be able to see Kinectimals or any of the other stuff.

154
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:23,400
I did touch PlayStation Move, you know, there was unfortunately we had to cancel our Sony

155
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:28,000
appointment for another interview with an exec and so that's what, so they cancelled

156
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,720
the Sony appointment but they do actually have some move games that are not required

157
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:38,920
to stand in a three hour line to get to. So I played Bowling, Brunswick Bowling and I

158
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:43,480
will say that the controller actually feels good in your hand, I mean it's, you know,

159
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:50,480
it feels a little bit better than holding a Wii remote to me but Bowling, I mean it's

160
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,860
kind of hard to see how more precise it is than like the Wii remote when you're playing

161
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:59,040
Bowling because that's such like the simplistic version and the Wii does a very good job Bowling

162
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:07,220
already. But no, it was really good to use and there was rumble in the controller and

163
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:14,080
everything so I really don't know what I can really say about it, I didn't get to play

164
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:17,720
the stuff they're really showing because I'd have to wait in a three hour line and I just

165
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:22,800
don't have three hours. Alright, well, you know, I know Shane and I have a whole list

166
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,600
of games we want to go over but Bobby since, you know, yesterday, between yesterday and

167
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,680
today are there any games that have kind of caught your eye that you want to, you know,

168
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:35,560
mention to the listenership right now? Okay, so here's one that, now, got to realize guys,

169
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:40,520
before I say this, last year my second favorite game of show was split second and I'm not

170
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:44,840
a fan of it now, now that it's out. So take this with a grain of salt because this might

171
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:51,460
be another one, Driver San Francisco, which was in Ubisoft, you know, yeah the Driver

172
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:56,840
games recently have been pretty bad, the ones that were by Atari or were published by Atari,

173
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:00,100
but they've kind of gone back to the roots of the first Driver which was actually pretty

174
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:07,840
good and the gameplay mechanic or gimmick or whatever you want to say in this was great.

175
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:12,520
Basically the storyline for it really quick because it makes no sense, they obviously

176
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:17,160
made the storyline to fit the gimmick rather than making the gimmick fit the storyline,

177
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:21,880
is that the character you play is in a coma. He doesn't realize he's in a coma, he just

178
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:26,000
thinks he has superpowers, but you're playing the entire game in his head and essentially

179
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,840
he's learned that his superpower in this coma that's in his head is that he can jump, he

180
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:38,220
can shift, that's the actual term in the game is shift, from car to car. So you can be driving

181
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:43,420
along in a car, hop out, all you do is you hit the A button, it goes to an aerial view

182
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:51,240
in this white light of God or whatever, and you can select another car, hit A, and then

183
00:12:51,240 --> 00:13:01,560
you're immediately in that car driving around. So you basically can jump from car to car

184
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:06,240
and then in missions and stuff, the way you activate missions is you see a police chase

185
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:11,800
in progress, you can activate that mission, you can either shift into the police car or

186
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:16,560
into the getaway car and you can complete the mission that way. And you can even do

187
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:25,720
stuff like one of the missions I did had two cop cars chasing the runaway and I could switch

188
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:31,200
between the two cop cars just with the press of a button. And so if I kind of messed up

189
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,200
with one and crashed into a wall I could jump into the other one, the AI would take over

190
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:41,600
that car, get it back up, and you can do it that way. And then what they said is, okay,

191
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,060
you might not be able to catch them with the cop car so you can shift out. And there was

192
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:50,660
a big rig about three blocks down. I shifted into the big rig and did a head-on collision

193
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:56,200
and that completed the mission. And they also said it's online and yes, you can shift around

194
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:00,240
online so it's like online races and stuff are going to change a lot with this because

195
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,240
everybody is shifting into other cars and if you have enough, they didn't say exactly

196
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,000
like how you can build up the shift power or whatever, but you could actually shift

197
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,080
into one of the other people's cars and kick them out and they have to get another car.

198
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:16,400
So it's going to be interesting to see, I mean it was a great demo, just like Split

199
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,880
Second was, it's going to be interesting to see if it delivers in the final product.

200
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:24,200
Alright, I have to admit I've always had zero interest in the Driver series besides just

201
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:29,000
kind of like making fun of Driver 3, but that whole kind of play mechanic sounds really

202
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,680
interesting. What about like maybe one other game that's kind of caught your attention

203
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:42,960
over the past couple of days? Okay, well basically it's not really a game, the 3DS. I was able

204
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:47,720
to go out and get my hands on the 3DS and as I've said on my show, I am one of the 15%

205
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:54,400
of Americans that cannot see the 3D TV. I cannot see Avatar in 3D. Basically it looks

206
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:59,500
like a darker 2D to me. It's because of my eye problems. I had eye surgery when I was

207
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:05,280
3, so my doctor knows about it and there's really not much we can do about it. That being

208
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:12,160
said, if I turn the slider on the 3DS all the way up and hold it at an extremely specific

209
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:19,960
angle, I can see 3D in the 3DS. I can actually see it. They had a trailer of Metal Gear Solid,

210
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:26,200
or the Metal Gear game that's going to be on the 3DS and I was flinching as some of

211
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:31,360
the things were flying at me. Now the problem with this is that that's great for trailers

212
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:39,760
or watching a movie or whatever. I tried to play Star Fox on it in 3D and I realized how

213
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:46,680
much I move the unit when I'm playing. If I move it any little bit, it starts getting

214
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:52,280
to be double images because basically it's prisms and stuff. So essentially what would

215
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:58,200
happen is I would move it just a tiny bit and then it would start seeing double images

216
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:02,320
and stuff. So I just turned the slider down to 2D. But it's still great in 2D. It's

217
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:08,200
still a better looking system than the DS. The graphics are improved even in 2D. I might

218
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:13,240
not be playing the 3D stuff all that much, but the 3D actually does work with my eyes.

219
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:20,240
Whereas Avatar in the movie theater and my dad's new Panasonic 3D TV, I took my PS3

220
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:27,040
over and I couldn't see the 3D and my parents thought it was amazing. Nintendo got you there.

221
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:31,600
That's pretty cool though because you must have had that moment of like, whoa. Because

222
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,200
I think when everybody sees the 3DS for the first time, and we talked about this extensively

223
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:41,280
yesterday, but just to kind of recap, I kind of said, okay, yeah it's a little gimmicky,

224
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:46,320
but it's a damn impressive gimmick. It definitely has the games to back it up and you go back

225
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,920
to the golden rule of gaming, the system is only as good as the games that are on it.

226
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,240
You know there's tons of great games coming out for this thing and graphically it's an

227
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:58,680
upgrade. But all gimmicks, so and so aside, there's still that moment when you first see

228
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:06,480
it where you're just kind of like, whoa, it really is kind of 3D and I'm not wearing glasses.

229
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:12,160
That's kind of cool. I mean, surely you probably had kind of that similar thing, but even probably

230
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,680
like double or triple so because you probably were very skeptical about it. Well actually

231
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:23,000
the first time I tried it I was looking at the Resident Evil trailer and I didn't really

232
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,560
know how the system worked so I was just kind of sitting there looking at it and I'm like,

233
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:32,840
yeah I don't see the 3D because they actually have these women behind there, behind each

234
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:39,920
system to kind of talk you through it. And I couldn't see it in the Resident Evil because

235
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:45,120
it was all double vision. I didn't know about having to tilt the angle vertically kind of.

236
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,400
You know, I kind of had to tilt the screen to be a specific scene. It's different for

237
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,640
everybody's eyes. And they didn't tell me that so I was just like, I can't see the 3D,

238
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:57,440
it's all just double images to me. And then I went over back to our PR rep and I was like,

239
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,340
yeah I didn't see it and they're like, well try this because the Metal Gear trailer was

240
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:07,320
more popping than the Resident Evil one. It was more extreme. And one of the girls behind

241
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:12,520
there said, I'm blind in my left eye and I can see the 3D in this. And so she trained

242
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:19,280
me and said, you should try tilting it this way and doing that. And then basically it

243
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:23,220
was right at the beginning of the Metal Gear trailer, there's the Kojima Studios logo and

244
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:28,400
it flies at you. That was my flinch holy shit moment, was the Kojima Studios logo flying

245
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:33,280
at me because I had finally gotten it right at the right angle and the woman, she was

246
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,920
very nice, but she said, yeah I'm blind in my left eye but I can still see this. And

247
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:43,480
she kind of helped me get it to the right area. I'm almost blown away but that is amazing.

248
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:49,840
She's blind in one eye and she can see it. That is a trip. That is very, very cool. Well

249
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,480
Bobby, if you don't mind, I'm going to spend some time with Shane and talk about what we

250
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,280
talked about today, but we'll come back to you a little later and see if there's anything

251
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,560
you want to add. If you want to jump in, just let me know. We only have kind of one mic

252
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:02,760
we're passing around here. You know, a very ghetto little portable kit. So again, if the

253
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:06,840
sound quality is bugging you, I apologize. This is much, much different than the usual

254
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:11,120
Sunday setup with a Dark Soccer and Loki. I do really, really want to make sure I do

255
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,280
plug the one and only Bobby Blackwolf show though. I'm sure most people that are actually

256
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:18,400
taking the time to listen this far into this already know about his show, but if you don't,

257
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,640
he's on right before us live on Sunday nights at All Games Radio, 5 o'clock Pacific, 8 o'clock

258
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:30,640
Eastern. Check it out. Miklotov, Shane, how you doing? Barely awake. Well I'm sorry, I

259
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:36,160
know we're keeping you up very late, but did you have a good day at E3 today? Yeah, despite

260
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,060
the fact that it wasn't the day we played the 3DS. I think today was a little bit more

261
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:47,000
fun, so that's how E3 should go I guess. Alright, well Shane and I kind of made a list of everything

262
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,120
we either kind of spent a long time looking at and got a tour through, or you know, we

263
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:55,120
actually got some hands-on time and played, so you want to go through this list a little

264
00:19:55,120 --> 00:20:01,160
bit Shane? Let's start off with a game that kind of really surprised me with how much

265
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:06,880
I liked it, DC Universe. What did you think about DC Universe, Shane? It was actually

266
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:12,960
very fun. The thing with DC Universe that I was skeptical about is it's yet another

267
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:19,960
superhero MMO. There seems to be a whole lot of those out there these days, but this one

268
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:28,680
was more action, and you don't really find that in MMOs. It's still the same sort of

269
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:34,480
World of Warcraft style, you target an enemy and then you stand around and you hit a button

270
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,640
and then you attack, and then you wait, and then you attack again. This one, I was flying

271
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:43,360
around, running around, jumping, bashing things in the head, freezing them. It was really

272
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:47,920
fun. Yeah, I loved the fact that it was a little more action-based, and the demo we

273
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:52,120
had to play was a PvP demo, and it was really cool. The guy that was demoing it was showing

274
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:56,040
us all these tricks, and I gotta say, you know, it was kind of like Phantasy Star Online,

275
00:20:56,040 --> 00:21:00,880
but on speed to me, because when I think action MMOs, there's not a lot I've really played

276
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,120
except for Phantasy Star Online and Phantasy Star Universe, but it was kind of like that,

277
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:10,680
but really fast-paced, and then kind of with that Warcraft twist where you do have bars

278
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:14,920
full of spells and things that you could use. So I'm curious to see kind of what the single-player

279
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:18,520
mode looks like. I will tell you one little tidbit we picked up on, though. I don't know

280
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:23,800
if this is out there completely yet, but the PlayStation 3 and the PC versions are not

281
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:29,560
gonna play together like a lot of people speculated they will, at least initially. I get the feeling

282
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:34,800
from the little demo we had that that's something that they might want to try to add in later.

283
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:39,200
I think the developers kind of think they can pull it off, but I think it's also kind

284
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,720
of like, I guess, they, you know, have other balancing things and, you know, because it's

285
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,600
two different systems or what have you. So if one of you was gonna get that on PS3 and

286
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:50,640
the other was on PC, do note you can't play together right off the bat, so I think that's

287
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:55,200
something a lot of folks are gonna want to take into consideration, yeah? So, cool, DC

288
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,080
Universe. When's that out? That was out, what, November 2nd, I think they said? All right,

289
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:05,320
how about Dead Rising 2, Shane? Let me preface this with I am scared to death of zombies

290
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:12,600
and the like, and I decided to, you know, face my fears, play some Dead Rising 2. The

291
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:17,840
game is really fun, very hilarious. I, what's his name, Chuck Green, I think, is the main

292
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:23,040
character you play as. Definitely dressed him up in some women's clothing, gave him

293
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:28,720
a nice little hat. At one point, I picked up a big stuffed pink elephant bear thing

294
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:35,720
and started hitting zombies with it. Saw some very hilarious gory moments, like some sort

295
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:43,840
of like lawnmower device just chewing up zombies and, oh, it was great. I had a really good

296
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:48,240
time. I actually think I want to get this game now, too. I gotta admit, it did look

297
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:53,520
a little like more of the same with the first one to me, but, you know, but upgraded in

298
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:57,760
the way that sequels should be upgraded, you know, it was a little more camp in some ways,

299
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,540
which I think is what everybody really appreciated about the first game and, you know, the main

300
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:05,720
character that they have now definitely seemed likable enough and, you know, I think people

301
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:09,720
are gonna get a kick out of the environment, especially, I think the whole like Vegas-y,

302
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,820
you know, what a fortune city or whatever they're calling it, the Vegas-like environment,

303
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:17,000
I think a lot of people are really gonna get a kick out of. LittleBigPlanet2, Shane, tell

304
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,040
me a little bit about what we did in that game, LittleBigPlanet2.

305
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:26,480
The level they gave us was somewhat of a race level, trying to reach the top before the

306
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:33,480
time limit. We failed, but it still let us keep going. I can't remember a game that had

307
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:39,600
made me smile and laugh so much while I was playing. It's really got a charm about it

308
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:44,400
that just makes you want to play more, which sucked because the demo, to me, felt so short,

309
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,480
but I know we were playing that thing for like five minutes at least.

310
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:52,320
Yeah, I think one important thing to note is that, you know, it really did kind of just

311
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,600
look and felt like the first game, you know, speaking of kind of, you know, games that

312
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:00,160
are more of the same, but you guys all know that the big innovation in LittleBigPlanet2

313
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:04,580
is kind of what they're letting you do now, you know, the expansion of the creation engine,

314
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:07,880
which is, you know, really the biggest part, and the part Shane left out about the race

315
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:12,380
is it was all about grappling hooks, and the part of what made it really funny is that,

316
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:15,600
you know, if Shane would be kind of like trying to grab on to something, I could actually

317
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,980
use my grappling hook to grab on to him, and it would kind of like, like the physics was

318
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:23,580
really good, I thought, and that was, you know, kind of the impressive part of the demo

319
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:28,840
is that they got the physics kind of, of all that complicated grappling and grappling mat

320
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:34,640
type of stuff down, so good times. So LittleBigPlanet2, I mean, I think a lot of you guys, like the

321
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:39,600
first one, are probably already going to check that out, and rightfully so. Tron, I played

322
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:44,160
the new Tron game, Tron Evolution, I believe it's called, on the 360, actually the version

323
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:49,740
I played is the PS3, but, you know, same same. Okay guys, it's Tron meets Prince of Persia,

324
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:53,840
like that's really what it felt like to me, you have the running up and wall jumping that

325
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:58,560
you do, and like seriously, the tutorial stage felt almost just like that first Prince of

326
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:03,200
Persia tutorial stage. The battle mechanics though, of course, are a lot different because,

327
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:08,560
you know, you're not really using a sword. The battle almost felt a little more like

328
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:12,360
Bayonetta to me, because like I could just practically button mash and do all this cool

329
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:17,720
shit, and there was like bullet time and all this, you know, kind of crazy stuff. The graphics

330
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:24,640
were simple, but that's what Tron's supposed to be, it's very true to the movie. It was

331
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:29,000
kind of hard for me to hear in the tunnel that they had, they had Tron in this big neon

332
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,120
kind of tunnel looking thing, it was a very, very cool setup, props to them, whoever designed

333
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:38,240
that booth. But, you know, it's very loud in there, but it sounded like the music I

334
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,880
could hear was kind of a repeat of the Daft Punk score that's supposed to be in the movie

335
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:47,640
and the music sounded like it was really good. Again, I'm kind of evaluating that on a very

336
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:54,240
quick demo and what I think I heard. But hopefully, a lot of the cool score will carry over. I

337
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,400
did have fun with it, I thought for an actiony game, it was it was a pretty cool little button

338
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:02,220
masher and it's Tron. Now, Shane, you don't even like know the Tron movie or what have

339
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:07,800
you, so did this game do anything for you? I know you just watched me play, but...

340
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:14,640
To be honest, not really. It seemed really bland. The graphics weren't that great, especially

341
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,680
considering the Wii one was right next to it, and it's kind of hard to tell the difference

342
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:26,200
between the two. And the environments were just really, really dull. It was a whole bunch

343
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:33,040
of black, blue, which, shockingly, you'd think I'd like, but it didn't look like a lot of

344
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:37,480
effort had been put into making the game. But that also might be the way the Tron series

345
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:43,040
is, but that doesn't translate well for a big, flashy video game.

346
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:46,240
Now see, I could tell the difference right away between the Xbox and the Wii one. Well,

347
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,240
for one, the Wii was all the light cycle racing, and I guess there's some of that in the PS3

348
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:56,240
one as well, but I don't know. It definitely looks sharper to me. I don't know with Shane

349
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:02,120
smoking, I think it'll be fine. But I guess, you know, if you don't know Tron at home listening,

350
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,840
then you're probably going to kind of look at this the same way. But for those of you

351
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:08,800
that are fans of Tron, like me, you're going to go like, oh, that's cool, because you throw

352
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:14,600
discs all over and doing these hops and bullet times and, woo, special effects.

353
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:19,840
Epic Mickey. We kind of had to watch one of the Disney employees play this, but we definitely

354
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:23,400
saw quite a bit of this game. Shane, what did you think of Epic Mickey?

355
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:31,040
It looked like a really solid platformer style game. I think the thing that interested me

356
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:38,720
the most, which is the one thing we didn't see a lot of, was the ability to erase and

357
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:51,240
regenerate certain aspects of stages. I did like the open-ended, not open-ended, but the

358
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:57,320
almost free-roaming little, what we saw, kind of tiki hut, is that what it's called? Yeah,

359
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:03,120
that section. The 2D was okay. I think that was probably my least favorite, but it looked

360
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,720
like a pretty interesting game.

361
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:09,000
I personally thought the 2D stuff looked kind of cool. It kind of looked like what maybe

362
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,800
you'd see on an Xbox Live arcade game or something, which was something, because the graphics

363
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,400
on the Wii were really good. Bobby wants to jump in on Epic Mickey.

364
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:22,480
Because I played it. Oh, yeah. That's right. Mickey is epic. I didn't play any of the 2D

365
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,480
stages. I played because there was another guy that was there that did the first part

366
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:30,260
of the demo, and I'm like, I'll just continue from here, because he had to run. But I battled

367
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:38,560
some enemies and stuff. Basically, it's kind of funny. Mickey can't directly hurt the enemies,

368
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:45,880
really. Basically, you've got your paint and your thinner. And basically, if you throw

369
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:50,240
enough paint at an enemy, it becomes your friend and starts fighting for you, kind of

370
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:56,240
like minions in Overlord and stuff. And I think if you do enough thinner at them, then

371
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:00,360
they go away and stuff. But there's actually some other things you can pick up. Like one

372
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:07,080
of the things that I did was pick up a special item that was a TV. And in order to distract

373
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:11,720
the guard, you threw the TV at him, and so he sits on his bucket and starts watching

374
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:16,040
Steamboat Willie on the TV. And then you can get around him and then basically take him

375
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:21,320
out, because there's this boat that needs to be risen, and so you need to get rid of

376
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:25,520
the anchors that are holding it down. And with the thinner, but you need to get in there.

377
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:30,840
So there's some puzzle elements. And then it wasn't really a boss, but it was a harder

378
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:38,160
enemy. Essentially, it has a can of paint in it, and it paints its own shell. So basically,

379
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:42,160
you fire paint at it to slow it down, and then you fire thinner at it to get rid of

380
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:46,800
its shell, and then he's got a weak spot that you hit for massive damage. And if you hit

381
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:54,800
this weak spot three times, then you beat him. And you can also have other of your friends

382
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:59,500
help him. And if you actually turn somebody to your side that has a can of thinner on

383
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:05,040
them, then they will, if they're your friend, they will throw thinner on the enemies and

384
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:09,000
hurt them and stuff. So it was really neat the way that they did it, and it looks really

385
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:14,320
good. It's very smooth and stuff, and it's still an early build. But I had a lot of fun

386
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:19,660
with it, and it looks like they are, because the guy told me War Inspector is a huge Disney

387
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:24,660
fanatic, especially of the older stuff, which is why the Steamboat Willie stuff is in there.

388
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:28,800
So he's really big on capturing the essence of Disney.

389
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:34,640
You know what really surprised me, though, just not knowing the old Disney as well as

390
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:39,920
the contemporary stuff? I was really surprised at how devious they let Mickey be in some

391
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:44,420
parts. I don't know if you saw the part with the tiki masks, but in the very beginning,

392
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:49,440
there's a little quest that Mickey's given to go get tiki masks. And what he can do,

393
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:54,520
he can go get the three masks and turn them in to the shopkeeper, and the shopkeeper will

394
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:59,840
reward him. Or what you can do, you find one mask, you give it to the shopkeeper, and then

395
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:04,560
the shopkeeper puts it in the back. Well, if you go walk around to the back of the building,

396
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:09,160
use paint thinner on the building, you can walk in the back door, take that mask, go

397
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:14,440
back out and give it back to him, and say, I found another mask. And I was kind of like,

398
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:18,000
it just kind of struck me as odd. I was always kind of like, I would have thought that, you

399
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:24,960
know, Von Disney would never let folks kind of portray Mickey in a negative light like

400
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,720
that. And his conscience or whatever, Gus or whatever that's kind of following around

401
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:33,440
is like, wow, I'm surprised you do that, Mickey. But it kind of makes him more bad. And you

402
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,760
could kind of see that because his his paint would be wearing off. And that's why he kind

403
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:40,120
of has that drippy look is because he had paint thinner. So I was kind of surprised

404
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:44,160
that you could kind of play it a little devious that Mickey didn't necessarily have to be

405
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:48,840
all good. I thought to me, that's the most fascinating part of Epic Mickey is the fact

406
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:52,940
that you can kind of play different ways. I really like games to let you do that. It's

407
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:56,920
very fable. I guess you could say, you know, you think your game kind of changes depending

408
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:02,100
on if you want to be good or bad. So yeah, Epic Mickey, very cool. A couple of DS games

409
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:05,680
that I know you checked out, Shane, I didn't get to spend a lot of time with these, but

410
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:08,120
Super Scribblenauts and the new Professor Layton.

411
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:14,240
Yeah, um, to be honest, I was not going to play Super Scribblenauts. It was an accident

412
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:19,440
thinking I was going to go play a different game. But I'm glad I did because I somewhat

413
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:25,060
liked the first Scribblenauts game. Like everyone had a problem with the controls. And I always

414
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:34,000
relied on anvils and laser guns to get through all the stages. But the nice lady at the demo

415
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:39,880
station was showing me just some of the stuff I could do. She's like, put whatever you want.

416
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:45,120
I was like, well, I don't know what to put. She's like, well, try, you know, big purple

417
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:50,900
pregnant dragon. I'm like, that's ridiculous. So okay. And sure enough, big dragon comes

418
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:57,320
out, has a little baby dragon. Like, what the crap? She's like, okay, go back and put

419
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:01,240
friendly in there somewhere. So I did that. And then the dragons fought each other. It's

420
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:09,620
like, okay, that's pretty cool. So with the controls being vastly improved and the inclusion

421
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:16,200
of adjectives, it actually looks like a really, really fun game. The other game I played was

422
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:22,840
Professor Layton Unwound Future or something like that. I don't remember exactly what it's

423
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:27,880
called. Newest Professor Layton game that's coming out this September, apparently. It's

424
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:34,360
Professor Layton. That's all you really need to know. It's fun. The one puzzle I did kind

425
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:38,760
of stumped me a little bit. Then the rep helped me out. So I felt really dumb because I actually

426
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:45,300
had it figured out. I just was too chicken to pick the wrong answer. I guess there's

427
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:51,840
a new inclusion to the memo function when you're in a puzzle. You can actually draw

428
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:56,800
in different colors and you can erase with an erase tool instead of just clearing the

429
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:05,280
entire thing, which is very handy. Both of those games, once again, I'm looking forward

430
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:10,120
to. I definitely will get Professor Layton. Scribblenauts is now on my list of things

431
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:14,320
I definitely will consider getting.

432
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,160
Since I've got to step it up and get through the rest of these games faster so we can actually

433
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:20,400
get to bed, do you want to describe Ghost Trick real quick, too? I know this is from

434
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,040
the guy who did Phoenix Wright.

435
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:29,560
Yeah, it's a game where you're a ghost and you have to manipulate objects to alter characters'

436
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:40,040
fate. They're fate because usually the characters die. At least they did in the demo. It's more

437
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:48,160
puzzle than anything else. Really interesting graphic style. The demo stumped me. I kind

438
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:54,000
of think I'm going to go back at some point tomorrow and try to beat it. It looks like

439
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,280
another brain teaser with lots of thinking involved from the same people that did Phoenix

440
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,640
Wright.

441
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,540
While he was playing some of those games, I actually checked out Goldeneye. The new

442
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:06,640
Goldeneye game is actually on the floor. It's kind of hard to find because Activision doesn't

443
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:11,960
have a booth, but Nintendo has it at their booth, only in a couple places. I got to fess

444
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:16,040
up, guys. If you've listened to O.L.R. a long time, you may already know this, but I never

445
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:21,560
really played Goldeneye 64. I didn't have Nintendo 64 until very late, so I never really

446
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:28,760
got into the craze until a little later. Playing this on the Wii was cool because it reminded

447
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:34,160
me of an old school shooter game. I get the sense that they have really just ported a

448
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:38,600
lot of the old game with new graphics. I suppose they were saying new stages and things too.

449
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:42,920
It's not just a copy of the old game. They want to make that very clear. It's new stuff

450
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:48,640
as well, not just Daniel Craig now. We were fighting multiplayer level and I was odd job

451
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:52,840
and I could throw my hat and stuff. It definitely reminded me of one of those old school arcade

452
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:59,480
shooters, very much like Perfect Dark, obviously, the connection between those games. Very interesting

453
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:05,280
that Activision is taking this over now. I know you only saw the game briefly, Shane,

454
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:11,160
Goldeneye, but did you notice anything lost in translation or anything? To me, it made

455
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:16,800
a very seamless transition from being a rare game to whoever is developing it now.

456
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:22,440
The only thing I noticed besides graphics that was a bit different, and this could just

457
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:27,480
be my memory being a little bit hazy, but I do not remember the ability to climb on

458
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:35,640
boxes and stuff like that, which was present in the demo we played. Otherwise, it looked

459
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:44,320
like a pretty faithful port of the Nintendo 64 with some updated features.

460
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,320
I think there will be a lot of people listening to this that are going to be into that. I

461
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:50,840
think about Bresloh and his love for Perfect Dark, I think a game like this will be right

462
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:54,880
up his alley. Quickly talking about some of the other games, we quickly got to observe

463
00:36:54,880 --> 00:37:00,840
the Castlevania Xbox Live arcade game, heavily influenced by Symphony of the Night. Lots

464
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:05,880
of zoom ins and outs on the different stages. It looks like you have 10 minutes, and you

465
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:11,920
can cooperatively or combatively, I guess you could say, against each other go after

466
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:17,320
the boss, but these stages seem to be very large, and you make your way towards the boss.

467
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:23,720
There is only really one stage in the demo that we could see, but it looked interesting.

468
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:26,920
I think because it is in the same vein as Symphony of the Night, it could be a lot of

469
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:31,040
fun, but it doesn't look like, and maybe I should have asked this, but it doesn't look

470
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:35,800
like there is a lot of single player stuff. Although, I imagine there might be time trials,

471
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:40,400
things of that nature. We didn't get to dig too deep into this game, but Shane, anything

472
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:44,760
from your quick impressions of the Castlevania Xbox Live game? Harmony of Despair, I think

473
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:51,160
it is? I think it looks like crap. I don't like the premise. Graphically, they could

474
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:56,120
have cleaned it up a little bit. The guys we watched playing it clearly did not know

475
00:37:56,120 --> 00:38:03,120
what they were doing, but the game also didn't seem to really give you much direction. I

476
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:08,320
don't know. I don't think it is something that they should have attempted. I might give

477
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:11,760
it a shot later on, but it definitely kind of has that Neo Geo effect with all the zoom

478
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:16,080
ins and outs, but I thought it looked good, and I am a fan of anything inspired by Symphony

479
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:21,160
of the Night, so I don't know Shane. You might want to give it a chance later. Here is a

480
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:26,800
game I am giving no chance at all. Saw 2. God, I watched Shane play the demo. If you

481
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:32,440
are eating something, you might want to pause this for a minute. In the very opening scene

482
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:37,400
of the demo, I think parodying a scene in the second movie, I have never seen it, but

483
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:41,960
I have heard about it, where the guy has to basically cut open his eye. Oh, God, it is

484
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:48,720
so gross. Were you doing that with the controller, actually cutting the eye? It was like, oh,

485
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:55,720
this is so disgusting. Shane, you described the demo as bleh. I had said when I saw the

486
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,680
Saw 2 game, I did not want to play the part where you cut open your eye, and of course

487
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:08,120
that is the first thing you do in the game, so I had to do it. Grossed me the heck out,

488
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:12,640
but much like the first Saw game, the game is really about puzzles and trying to figure

489
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:19,640
out stuff. I love it. It is kind of my replacement, or not my replacement, but just something

490
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:27,160
to get me through the time when we do not have Silent Hill, because it is still kind

491
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:34,160
of scary and it has got the nice atmosphere. It is very gory, and if you are at all squeamish,

492
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:41,160
I saw so many different things die during the five minutes I played of the demo, and

493
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:47,820
only one of them was me, thankfully. The rest were cut little flashbacks to people getting

494
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:54,820
impaled, sliced with a buzzsaw, all sorts of fun things. But yeah, it felt like a pretty

495
00:39:54,820 --> 00:40:01,820
good game again, and I cannot wait for it to come out, but it is really gross.

496
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:09,700
That is the game I should show to my mother. These are what video games are, mom. Do not

497
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:15,540
you love these? Alright, here is a game my mom would like, but I would never understand

498
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:26,220
why. Glee Karaoke Revolution. Basically, it is Karaoke Revolution. It is the little bars

499
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:31,960
along the bottom that move with the pitch, and all the videos are Glee. So there is really

500
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:38,960
no interface in the game itself, besides just the little pitch bars and a very light shell

501
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:45,480
around that. There are no characters anymore. If you remember in Karaoke Revolution, you

502
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:49,200
would have these venues and things. No, you do not really have that anymore. It is just

503
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:54,560
videos from Glee that only kind of go with the songs, because they will try to show it,

504
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:58,160
synced up with how it was in the show, but since the songs in the show are shorter, they

505
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:04,520
will just throw in all these random clips. It was on the Wii, the version we were playing,

506
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:10,760
so the video quality was kind of poop. I watched Glee in HD at home when I was watching the

507
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:16,760
first few episodes, and I just thought the game was just kind of... I was barely singing

508
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:22,480
the song, and I got like five stars. Now granted, I was on the lowest difficulty, and it was

509
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:27,360
probably dumbed down because it was a demo, blah blah blah, but I just, I do not know.

510
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:31,760
I guess for the hardcore Glee fans, they will be all over it, but I just thought it was,

511
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:35,200
it is kind of one of those things where as you make a copy of a copy of a copy of a copy,

512
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:39,000
it starts to wear down a little bit, and that is kind of where I was at with Glee Karaoke

513
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,540
Revolution. I mean, it is a cute license idea. I mean, it is kind of one of those things

514
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:45,000
where once we saw it, it is like, oh yeah, of course, of course there was going to be

515
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:52,220
a Glee game. Shane, were your thoughts different? Nope. I also thought it was pretty terrible.

516
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:57,040
My problem with it is, and this is the same thing that has happened before, is that Konami

517
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:05,760
buys rights to a very, very popular IP and then does not put any effort into it, thinking

518
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:11,800
that the brand name will sell itself. Unfortunately, as we learned with the American Idol Karaoke

519
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:19,720
Revolution games, that is not going to work, and this is a very, very good opportunity

520
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:25,360
to make some money, but they just need to invest a little more because right now, I

521
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:30,160
do not see any potential in the game. The sad thing is though, Shane, I think it is

522
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:33,200
going to sell very well because I think there will be a lot of teenage girls that are like,

523
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,780
I love Glee, and they will buy the game on the Wii, and they do not look for the same

524
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:40,800
stuff we do. So I think you kind of have to take Shane and I's impressions of the game

525
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:44,320
with a big grain of salt. I think the game will still do really well. It is just not

526
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:51,040
going to do well with people listening to or recording video game podcasts about other

527
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:55,680
types of games, you know what I mean? There is an audience for this that is just not us.

528
00:42:55,680 --> 00:43:02,440
Well, as someone who is a huge fan of Glee and has bought all five CDs, on the day they

529
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:10,200
came out, no less, each one of them, all I would need is just a few minor tweaks to the

530
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:20,160
interface, and I would actually be fine with, for the most part, what we saw. It just does

531
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:26,720
not feel like it is anywhere near done. I actually hope that is the case.

532
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:30,240
All right, just a couple of quick ones. We will kind of wrap up talking about what was

533
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:35,960
at Sega's booth and some of the things we saw there. Sonic 4, Episode 1. I think it

534
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:39,840
is pretty much what all of you are expecting. It looks like the old Sonic games, but with

535
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:44,980
HD graphics, that is really what it is. I mean, what else can you say about it? Either

536
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:48,320
you have played the old games or you have not. I do not know, did you notice any minor

537
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:54,200
tweaks that I might be overlooking, Shane? When I played it, it really did feel like

538
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:59,320
Sonic. His animations are a little slow at the moment, but I overheard them saying that

539
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:06,160
they were going to fix that. The boss fight felt a little more complex than what I was

540
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:13,080
used to from a Sonic game of that quality, so I am pleased. I cannot wait for it to come

541
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:17,120
out. I also overheard them talk about, well, we

542
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:21,200
had to take all of this into evaluation and listen to the fans. They wanted Sonic to be

543
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:26,760
able to accelerate faster from walking to running and all that stuff. I was just kind

544
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:31,200
of like, okay, yes, that is great, but I think on most people, sadly, that type of effort

545
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,520
will probably be lost because I think a lot of people are going to have that same type

546
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:38,040
of reaction where it is like, oh, hey, it is Sonic 2, but HD. That is not a bad thing.

547
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:40,760
Old Sonic games were when they were really the best.

548
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:48,160
Alright, Phantasy Star Portable 2. I do not know. It was pretty much just like the first

549
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:51,200
one to me. I did not get to ask a lot of questions on that. I really wanted to see if the pizza

550
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:56,320
box was still there. I do not know, Shane. Did you notice anything different, really,

551
00:44:56,320 --> 00:45:03,240
except not being able to skip cut scenes? The only addition that they have really made,

552
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:09,300
it seems, is the ability to roll around and dodge, which, you know, if you were like me

553
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:14,280
and download the Japanese trial, you already knew that. Otherwise, it is pretty much the

554
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:22,440
same game. From what I understand, they had somewhat famous, I think, manga or anime artists

555
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:27,360
in Japan do the new character designs. They need to never do that again because they have

556
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:30,960
made the characters worse looking.

557
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,860
Are not a lot of the characters just kind of copied from old games because I swear that

558
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:37,480
shark you were fighting in the very beginning was like the same damn thing that was in the

559
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:40,420
Dreamcast PSO.

560
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:45,840
Those are completely different. I am talking about the characters you can create yourself.

561
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:54,560
They changed the faces. They changed the costumes. It does not look nearly as good, I think.

562
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:58,120
Really your character looked kind of cool to me, at least the one I saw. I did not think

563
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:00,840
it was terrible.

564
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:06,440
After spending a lot of time with the character creator in the first game, to me, I noticed

565
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:09,880
how bad. It is really the faces. The faces look really terrible.

566
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:15,640
I guess we will close out today with a game I know Bobby had wanted to say something to

567
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:21,640
on at some point. This is also at Sega's booth. Sega was also showing off some iPads. One

568
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:27,360
of the iPads had Super Monkey Ball 2 on the iPad. I think all of us got a chance to touch

569
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:28,360
that game.

570
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:32,200
Shane, we will start with you. What do you think of Super Monkey Ball 2 on the iPad?

571
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:40,760
The theme for tonight is, I guess, I hated it. It just controlled like crap. Seriously,

572
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:46,400
my iPhone plays Monkey Ball better than that iPad demo that they had, so I am not impressed.

573
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:51,480
Not making me want to buy an iPad. Not making me want to download another Monkey Ball game.

574
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:55,720
Bobby, was the demo lost on YouTube?

575
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:59,180
It is shit.

576
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:03,660
You know, I got the controls pretty quick. It is just that little device was calibrated

577
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:10,380
weird. At the end of the day, I was like, yeah, Monkey Ball was better a long time ago.

578
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:11,880
I think this one is going to be a pass.

579
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:16,840
There you go. I guess we are going to go ahead and wrap up for the night. We are ready to

580
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:21,400
go to bed. God, it is already 1.30 and I still have to get this uplifted. Thanks for staying

581
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:26,160
up with us or whatever time of day it is where you are and listening to the little wrap up

582
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:27,160
today.

583
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:30,600
We will probably do another quick one tomorrow. It probably will not be super long because

584
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:35,280
I know Bobby has to fly out to Atlanta and all that stuff. Tomorrow, we will try to give

585
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:41,000
you some final impressions. Our most favorite thing we have seen at the show we will get

586
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:45,520
to tomorrow. I know we are going to be seeing Final Fantasy XIV tomorrow. I am really hoping

587
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:49,360
to make it to Civ V. Actually, I am supposed to have some time to sit down with Civilization

588
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:53,280
V. It is actually exciting. I know Bobby is going to finally get to see Rock Band 3 tomorrow.

589
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:56,680
So we will have more stuff to talk about tomorrow. Again, if you have questions, feedback, whatever

590
00:47:56,680 --> 00:48:01,680
Twitter is the best way to get us on the show floor. I actually did get some requests to

591
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:08,800
see things today that I took pictures of. There was NHL 11. Kirby's Epic Yarn I need

592
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:12,320
to get tomorrow again. I already put one picture up but somebody wanted to know more about

593
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:16,240
it. I will try to get that for impressions tomorrow. I am seeing the stuff on Twitter

594
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:23,600
guys so keep sending those. Twitter.com slash OLR. Any closing thoughts for the night, Bobby?

595
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:29,840
Monkey Ball and iPad is shit. Sounds good. Any closing thoughts for tonight, Shane?

596
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:35,920
I can't wait to live at the Final Fantasy XIV booth tomorrow and never leave it. Alright

597
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:42,280
guys, I guess my final thought is it is time to get this uploaded and go to bed. Cheesecake

598
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:46,800
is delicious just for the record. It is very good. Okay, have a good night everybody. We

599
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:50,760
will see you tomorrow with another Rob Roberts special here on the Orange Lounge Radio feed.

600
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:55,760
Good night.
