1
00:00:05,543 --> 00:00:10,228
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody, it's Rob Roberts again here at E3 for a little special show for our feed here.

2
00:00:10,408 --> 00:00:12,330
[SPEAKER_00]: Rob Roberts and pals at E3.

3
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:20,358
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the Wednesday edition or the second day of E3, although that's somewhat of a fib because it's technically Thursday right now as we tape this.

4
00:00:20,919 --> 00:00:24,983
[SPEAKER_00]: It's after 1230 in the morning, so it's even later than we taped last night.

5
00:00:25,043 --> 00:00:28,626
[SPEAKER_00]: But you'll notice my voice at least is doing a little better today, so that's a good thing.

6
00:00:29,066 --> 00:00:31,908
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hopefully won't be straining as bad as I was yesterday.

7
00:00:32,489 --> 00:00:36,052
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyhow, let's get right into the show and kind of talk about some of the things we saw today.

8
00:00:36,092 --> 00:00:41,497
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we don't have a lot of news for you guys or anything, because I'm sure a lot of you guys have been reading the different websites.

9
00:00:41,517 --> 00:00:43,899
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked a lot about what the press conferences were all about yesterday.

10
00:00:44,359 --> 00:00:47,522
[SPEAKER_00]: But we just kind of want to tell you about our perspective on some of the things we've tried and

11
00:00:47,782 --> 00:00:49,222
[SPEAKER_00]: and some of the things we got our hands on.

12
00:00:49,242 --> 00:00:54,684
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of our listeners have come to kind of want to know what we think of some of the games we get to get our hands on.

13
00:00:55,604 --> 00:01:04,907
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll tell you a little bit about my experience in a little bit, but we want to catch up with definitely a pal of Orange Lounge Radio, somebody who's been a supporter of our show for a very long time.

14
00:01:04,947 --> 00:01:05,907
[SPEAKER_00]: We try to support him too.

15
00:01:06,448 --> 00:01:10,151
[SPEAKER_00]: The one and only, straight out of Atlanta, Bobby Blackwolf is here.

16
00:01:10,431 --> 00:01:11,472
[SPEAKER_01]: Woo!

17
00:01:11,532 --> 00:01:12,092
[SPEAKER_01]: That's me.

18
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:12,733
[SPEAKER_01]: How you doing?

19
00:01:13,453 --> 00:01:23,020
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, I wasn't able to be a part of the show last night because I was getting drunk and attempting to rickroll the entire Bethesda party and failed.

20
00:01:23,761 --> 00:01:24,461
[SPEAKER_01]: It was very terrible.

21
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:32,047
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the low point of my E3 when they turned off the karaoke at 1am and I was one song away from rickrolling everybody.

22
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:34,552
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my biggest disappointment of E3.

23
00:01:35,213 --> 00:01:38,798
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have to throw this in, though.

24
00:01:38,918 --> 00:01:47,389
[SPEAKER_00]: He may not have gotten to Rickroll everybody, but if you do want to see his awesome Night of Fire routine, it's all over Twitter right now, so check that out.

25
00:01:48,735 --> 00:01:49,956
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we're getting to that.

26
00:01:51,396 --> 00:02:01,521
[SPEAKER_01]: I do want to say that I was a part of the Activision saying, hey, we didn't have to pay that bonus to Infinity Ward, let's throw a party event.

27
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:14,168
[SPEAKER_01]: Which was, you've probably read about it and seen it, it's the six million dollar party they threw in the Staples Center on Monday night, showcasing just four games.

28
00:02:14,952 --> 00:02:21,827
[SPEAKER_01]: DJ Hero 2, Guitar Hero, Warriors of Rock, True Crime Hong Kong, and Call of Duty Black Ops.

29
00:02:22,449 --> 00:02:35,238
[SPEAKER_01]: with some cheap performers like Usher and Jane's Addiction and Soundgarden and this guy named Eminem with Rihanna and a stripper.

30
00:02:35,498 --> 00:02:36,279
[SPEAKER_00]: I love Eminems.

31
00:02:36,999 --> 00:02:37,259
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

32
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,141
[SPEAKER_01]: I only want the red and black ones.

33
00:02:39,501 --> 00:02:44,064
[SPEAKER_01]: But the highlight obviously was the pole dancer.

34
00:02:44,084 --> 00:02:45,966
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to say stripper because she didn't strip.

35
00:02:46,526 --> 00:02:51,990
[SPEAKER_01]: But the pole dancer, they lowered a pole from the rafters of the Staples Center.

36
00:02:52,797 --> 00:03:01,040
[SPEAKER_01]: and she literally went probably about halfway up, which is like to the club seats on this pole and hanging upside down and all that stuff.

37
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:01,720
[SPEAKER_01]: She stole the show.

38
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:08,202
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, $6 million and on top of that, they gave us free beer.

39
00:03:10,283 --> 00:03:15,725
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, clearly they had to bring in a pole dancer because the video game industry is so dominated by women and gay men.

40
00:03:17,563 --> 00:03:27,465
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly, but to me, to me, that was the biggest F you to the former Infinity Ward guys because that was probably their bonus that they spent.

41
00:03:28,186 --> 00:03:38,028
[SPEAKER_01]: But hey, let me tell you guys this, you have never witnessed a video game trailer until you see it with full pyrotechnics all around you, the Call of Duty trailer.

42
00:03:38,704 --> 00:03:51,058
[SPEAKER_01]: is the same one you've probably seen online except they decided that it was going to, instead of the music being canned, they actually did have a full orchestra down in the pit playing the music for the trailer because the conductor was up on stage.

43
00:03:51,078 --> 00:03:52,059
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, what is he conducting?

44
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,061
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, there's an orchestra down there because I was far in the back.

45
00:03:54,665 --> 00:04:14,666
[SPEAKER_01]: and then like halfway through you know just one big pyrotechnic like with explosion on the screen pyrotechnics went around and I was like oh that's cool they did some pyrotechnics and then every explosion for the rest of the trailer had either pyrotechnics or firecrackers from the top and it was that that was the way to experience a trailer I'm still not gonna play Call of Duty Black Ops

46
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:24,180
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it possible that maybe they didn't just do it as like kind of like, you know, spend all that bonus money that, you know, they were supposed to pay out, but that maybe they sold the booth on eBay as well?

47
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,263
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I noticed their booth is nowhere to be found.

48
00:04:26,323 --> 00:04:32,770
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think maybe they sold all the parts of the booth and that maybe paid for like the Dom Perignon that Eminem needed backstage.

49
00:04:34,386 --> 00:04:34,966
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably.

50
00:04:35,727 --> 00:04:36,708
[SPEAKER_01]: They do have a presence.

51
00:04:36,748 --> 00:04:39,309
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they've got a place, they've got some meeting rooms.

52
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:52,157
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically what they're doing is that, you know, by appointment you can go in and basically they have these little rooms where you get a 30 minute demo of the game and sometimes hands-on and that's where they're showing all their games.

53
00:04:52,638 --> 00:04:58,221
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's by appointment only and they like it a lot better because it's not as hectic and loud and stuff.

54
00:04:58,402 --> 00:05:02,024
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did get to actually go in and see Guitar Hero.

55
00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:03,680
[SPEAKER_01]: Warriors of Rock.

56
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,281
[SPEAKER_01]: I have not been able to see Rock Band yet, so don't ask me which one's better.

57
00:05:06,821 --> 00:05:11,844
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, kind of going into games, and this was actually one of the most recent things I saw as well.

58
00:05:12,985 --> 00:05:20,749
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Guitar Hero, but they showed us the Quest Mode, which is not Career Mode, it's Quest Mode now.

59
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:23,671
[SPEAKER_01]: And it actually brings a little bit of, you know, it

60
00:05:24,306 --> 00:05:24,606
[SPEAKER_01]: and so on.

61
00:05:48,411 --> 00:05:54,073
[SPEAKER_01]: where you can select a friend's score off of the leaderboard and then it will show you how close you are to his score.

62
00:05:54,513 --> 00:05:59,675
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can send him a message on Xbox Live making fun of him because you just beat his score.

63
00:06:00,575 --> 00:06:03,696
[SPEAKER_00]: Will I be able to spam his Twitter and his Facebook and everything else too?

64
00:06:04,778 --> 00:06:06,399
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I think it is just OS.

65
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:08,140
[SPEAKER_01]: They've said it was just OS messages.

66
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:17,987
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, you know, you receive an Xbox Live message, kind of like what I get from Spazinator in some games, that, you know, he beat my high score in something.

67
00:06:19,488 --> 00:06:25,111
[SPEAKER_00]: Or the ones I love is that, you know, so-and-so wants to play Modern Warfare 2 with you, and I'm like, okay, do you listen to OLR?

68
00:06:25,172 --> 00:06:27,833
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I just, no disrespect to those games.

69
00:06:28,033 --> 00:06:30,355
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand why they have an audience and so forth, but

70
00:06:30,967 --> 00:06:31,387
[SPEAKER_00]: Dance Masters

71
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,281
[SPEAKER_01]: from Konami, which broke my Kinect virginity.

72
00:06:55,842 --> 00:07:01,243
[SPEAKER_01]: Because unfortunately, see what I've been doing, I've been working with e3coverage.com and we do a lot of interviews and stuff.

73
00:07:01,704 --> 00:07:13,448
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we go into appointments, it's not really about, for Game Tactics, for Justin Lee, who's the editor of Game Tactics, it's not really about seeing the games, it's about getting the interviews.

74
00:07:14,028 --> 00:07:17,029
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had an hour long Microsoft appointment and didn't see a single game.

75
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:44,046
[SPEAKER_01]: because they brought in, since it's also a Canadian site, they brought up the Xbox Live manager for Canada and we interviewed him, the hardware manager for Canada and basically a lot of general people about Xbox in Canada and that was the entire hour was standing up there so I didn't get to really play Kinect except in the Konami booth and I'm a C dancer, that's what it said.

76
00:07:45,195 --> 00:08:08,918
[SPEAKER_01]: Now one thing I do want to say about it is the menu system this is what kind of threw me a little bit there might be a learning curve for some people because in the menu system for at least Dance Masters which is a third-party game so maybe Microsoft has it better it's very sensitive to your movements so basically you do the minority report type of thing like you know let's what happened to us is you know selecting the difficulty level between light and standard and

77
00:08:09,498 --> 00:08:18,951
[SPEAKER_01]: and to hit okay in Dance Masters, you have to put your hand up and then to the right and then, you know, kind of to touch the okay thing that's at the top right of the screen.

78
00:08:19,472 --> 00:08:22,756
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, when I had done it, I had said, okay, we're going to do standard and

79
00:08:23,271 --> 00:08:29,432
[SPEAKER_01]: and when I moved my arm up, and it's kind of funny, I'm doing this hand motion, I know you can't see it, but it's so I can explain it.

80
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:33,453
[SPEAKER_01]: You're supposed to move your hand up and then to the right.

81
00:08:33,493 --> 00:08:36,593
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, when I moved it up, I didn't exactly move it straight up.

82
00:08:36,913 --> 00:08:38,094
[SPEAKER_01]: I went a little bit to the right.

83
00:08:38,654 --> 00:08:44,075
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I did that, it moved down to light, but I had already started the motion of hitting okay.

84
00:08:44,755 --> 00:08:46,555
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's going to take a little bit of getting used to.

85
00:08:46,595 --> 00:08:48,995
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to be a little bit more precise than you think.

86
00:08:49,035 --> 00:08:51,696
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're going to sit there and say, there's no learning curve.

87
00:08:52,196 --> 00:08:53,617
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think there might be for some people.

88
00:08:54,517 --> 00:08:57,158
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, I had a little hands-on time with Dance Masters today, too.

89
00:08:57,238 --> 00:09:00,499
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I played a song on there, too, and was going through the menu.

90
00:09:00,539 --> 00:09:07,022
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of threw me was that, you know, Natal is supposed to be this whole, you're just going to hold up your hand and wave it around.

91
00:09:07,062 --> 00:09:11,684
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you wave it around, you'll be able to select the songs or, you know, whatever it is, change the channels.

92
00:09:12,104 --> 00:09:15,265
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but I found as I was going through this Dance Masters, it was like, okay, I'm

93
00:09:15,465 --> 00:09:20,029
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, to choose the number of players, you're going to kind of, you're going to put your hand up and then you're going to put it over to the right.

94
00:09:20,109 --> 00:09:21,611
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it was like, okay, it changed the difficulty.

95
00:09:21,631 --> 00:09:23,493
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to kind of reach around to left.

96
00:09:23,553 --> 00:09:25,735
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, you know, you put your right hand in, you put your right hand out.

97
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:26,936
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I shake it all about?

98
00:09:26,956 --> 00:09:28,777
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, do the hokey pokey, turn yourself around.

99
00:09:29,118 --> 00:09:34,222
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like, oh my gosh, like maybe it's just, there's going to be a natural learning curve with all that stuff.

100
00:09:34,262 --> 00:09:36,044
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm being a little harsh, but I was kind of like,

101
00:09:36,638 --> 00:09:36,958
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

102
00:09:36,978 --> 00:09:37,078
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

103
00:10:04,389 --> 00:10:09,076
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember that, you know, where you have to, like, wave your hand over the circle and stuff, and yeah.

104
00:10:09,857 --> 00:10:13,222
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but that's the only Kinect experience I've had.

105
00:10:13,282 --> 00:10:17,148
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm probably not going to be able to see Kinectimals or any of the other stuff.

106
00:10:17,548 --> 00:10:19,111
[SPEAKER_01]: I did touch PlayStation Move.

107
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:36,580
[SPEAKER_01]: You know there was a unfortunately we had to cancel our Sony appointment for another interview with an exec and so that's what so they canceled the Sony appointment but they do actually have some so some move games that are not required to stand in a three-hour line to get to so I play bowling

108
00:10:37,520 --> 00:11:01,697
[SPEAKER_01]: Brunswick Bowling and I will say that the controller actually feels good in your hand I mean it's it's you know it feels a little bit better than holding a Wii Remote to me but bowling and enemy it's it's it's kind of hard to see how more precise it is than like the Wii Remote when you're playing bowling because that's such like the simplistic version and the Wii does a very good job bowling already but no it was it was

109
00:11:02,884 --> 00:11:07,705
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really good to use, and there was rumble in the controller and everything.

110
00:11:08,265 --> 00:11:12,386
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really don't know what I can really say about it.

111
00:11:12,426 --> 00:11:18,528
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't get to play the stuff they're really showing, because I'd have to wait in a three-hour line, and I just don't have three hours.

112
00:11:20,288 --> 00:11:20,588
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

113
00:11:20,909 --> 00:11:30,751
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I know Shane and I have a whole list of games we want to go over, but Bobby, between yesterday and today, are there any games that have caught your eye that you want to mention to the listenership right now?

114
00:11:32,048 --> 00:11:39,450
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so here's one that, now, gotta realize guys, before I say this, last year my second favorite game of show was Split Second.

115
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:42,370
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not a fan of it now, now that it's out.

116
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:45,551
[SPEAKER_01]: So take this with a grain of salt, because this might be another one.

117
00:11:46,111 --> 00:11:55,733
[SPEAKER_01]: Driver San Francisco, which was in Ubisoft, um, you know, yeah, the Driver games recently have been pretty bad, the ones that were by Atari, or were published by Atari.

118
00:11:56,705 --> 00:12:06,651
[SPEAKER_01]: but they've kind of gone back to the roots of the first Driver which was actually pretty good and the gameplay mechanic or gimmick or whatever you want to say in this was great.

119
00:12:07,331 --> 00:12:11,694
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, the storyline for it really quick because it makes no sense.

120
00:12:12,014 --> 00:12:19,438
[SPEAKER_01]: They obviously made the storyline to fit the gimmick rather than making the gimmick fit the storyline is that the character you play is in a coma.

121
00:12:20,038 --> 00:12:24,561
[SPEAKER_01]: He doesn't realize he's in a coma, he just thinks he has superpowers but you're playing the entire game in his head.

122
00:12:25,387 --> 00:12:36,511
[SPEAKER_01]: and essentially he's learned that his superpower in this coma that's in his head is that he can jump, he can shift, that's the actual term in the game is shift, from car to car.

123
00:12:37,091 --> 00:12:54,417
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can be driving along in a car, hop out, but all you do is you hit the A button, it goes to an aerial view and a little, and like this white light of God or whatever and you can select another car, hit A and then you're immediately in that car driving around.

124
00:12:55,100 --> 00:13:12,828
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you basically can jump from car to car, and then in missions and stuff, the way you activate missions is you see a police chase in progress, you can activate that mission, you can either shift into the police car, or into the getaway car.

125
00:13:13,769 --> 00:13:15,330
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can complete the mission that way.

126
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:22,593
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can even do stuff like, one of the missions I did had two cop cars chasing the runaway.

127
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:28,157
[SPEAKER_01]: and I could switch between the two cop cars just with the press of a button.

128
00:13:28,757 --> 00:13:34,198
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if I kind of messed up with one and crashed into a wall, I could jump into the other one.

129
00:13:34,218 --> 00:13:38,079
[SPEAKER_01]: The AI would take over that car, get it back up, and you can do it that way.

130
00:13:38,319 --> 00:13:44,320
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what they said is, okay, you might not be able to catch them with the cop car, so you can shift out.

131
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,540
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was a big rig about three blocks down.

132
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,141
[SPEAKER_01]: I shifted into the big rig and did a head-on collision, and that completed the mission.

133
00:13:53,427 --> 00:14:19,038
[SPEAKER_01]: and they also said it's online and yes you can shift around online so it's like online races and stuff are going to change a lot with this because everybody's shifting into other cars and if you have enough they didn't say exactly like how you can build up the shift power or whatever but you could actually shift into one of the other people's cars and kick them out and they have to get another car so it's going to be interesting to see I mean it was a great demo just like Split Second was it's going to be interesting to see if it delivers in the final product

134
00:14:20,194 --> 00:14:29,580
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, I have to admit, I've always had zero interest in the Driver series besides just kind of like making fun of Driver 3, but that whole kind of play mechanic sounds really interesting.

135
00:14:31,101 --> 00:14:34,483
[SPEAKER_00]: What about like maybe one other game that's kind of caught your attention over the past couple days?

136
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:40,786
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, well, basically, it's not really a game, but the 3DS.

137
00:14:42,476 --> 00:14:55,461
[SPEAKER_01]: I was able to go and get my hands on the 3DS, and as I've said on my show, I am one of the 15% of Americans that cannot see the 3D TV, I cannot see Avatar in 3D, basically it looks like a darker 2D to me.

138
00:14:55,982 --> 00:15:04,265
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because of my eye problems, I had eye surgery when I was 3, so my doctor knows about it, and there's really not much we can do about it.

139
00:15:04,966 --> 00:15:15,292
[SPEAKER_01]: That being said, if I turn the slider on the 3DS all the way up and hold it at an extremely specific angle, I can see 3D in the 3DS.

140
00:15:15,412 --> 00:15:16,293
[SPEAKER_01]: I can actually see it.

141
00:15:16,733 --> 00:15:27,320
[SPEAKER_01]: They had a trailer of Metal Gear Solid, or the Metal Gear game that's going to be on the 3DS, and I was flinching as some of the things were flying at me.

142
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,724
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the problem with this is that that's great for trailers, or watching a movie or whatever.

143
00:15:34,724 --> 00:15:43,371
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried to play Star Fox on it in 3D, and I realized how much I move the unit when I'm playing.

144
00:15:44,011 --> 00:15:50,216
[SPEAKER_01]: If I move it any little bit, it starts getting to be double images, because basically it's prisms and stuff.

145
00:15:50,776 --> 00:16:00,163
[SPEAKER_01]: So essentially what would happen is I would move it just a tiny bit, and then it would start seeing double images and stuff, so I'd just turn the slider down to 2D.

146
00:16:00,864 --> 00:16:03,986
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's still great in 2D, it's still a better looking system.

147
00:16:04,526 --> 00:16:05,066
[SPEAKER_01]: then the DS.

148
00:16:05,107 --> 00:16:25,258
[SPEAKER_01]: The graphics are improved even in 2D so I might not be playing the 3D stuff all that much but the 3D actually does work with my eyes whereas Avatar in the movie theater and you know my dad's new Panasonic 3D TV with I took my PS3 over I couldn't see the 3D my parents thought it was amazing so Nintendo got you there.

149
00:16:26,795 --> 00:16:56,345
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty cool, though, because you must have had that moment of like, whoa, because I think when everybody sees the 3DS for the first time, and we talked about this somewhat extensively yesterday, but just to kind of recap, I kind of said, okay, yeah, it's a little gimmicky, but it's a damn impressive gimmick, and it definitely has the games to back it up, and you go back to the golden rule of gaming, a system is only as good as the games that are on it, and you know there's tons of great games coming out for this thing, and graphically it's an upgrade, but all gimmicks, so and so aside,

150
00:16:56,806 --> 00:17:05,750
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still that moment when you first see it where you're just kind of like, whoa, it really is kind of 3D and I'm not wearing glasses.

151
00:17:06,231 --> 00:17:07,411
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of cool.

152
00:17:07,831 --> 00:17:15,535
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, surely you probably had kind of that similar thing, but even probably like double or triple so because you probably were very skeptical about it.

153
00:17:16,295 --> 00:17:17,616
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, actually, the first time I tried it,

154
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:34,482
[SPEAKER_01]: I was looking at the Resident Evil trailer and I didn't really know how the system worked so I was just kind of sitting there looking at it and I'm like, yeah, I don't see the 3D because they actually have these women behind each system to kind of talk you through it.

155
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:41,026
[SPEAKER_01]: And I couldn't see it in the Resident Evil because it was all double vision.

156
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:45,290
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know about having to tilt the angle vertically, kind of.

157
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:49,194
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of had to tilt the screen to be a specific... And it's different for everybody's eyes.

158
00:17:49,795 --> 00:17:53,779
[SPEAKER_01]: And they didn't tell me that, so I was just like, I can't see the 3D, it's all just double images to me.

159
00:17:54,341 --> 00:18:12,797
[SPEAKER_01]: and then I went over back to our PR rep and I was like yeah I didn't see it and they're like well try this because the Metal Gear trailer was more popping than the Resident Evil one it was more extreme and one of the girls behind there said I'm blind in my left eye and I can see the 3D in this and so she trained me

160
00:18:13,457 --> 00:18:24,023
[SPEAKER_01]: and said you should try tilting it this way and doing that and then basically it was right at the beginning of the Metal Gear trailer there's the Kojima Studios logo and it flies at you.

161
00:18:24,163 --> 00:18:39,931
[SPEAKER_01]: That was my flinch holy shit moment was the Kojima Studios logo flying at me because I had finally gotten it right at the right angle and the woman who she was very nice but she said yeah I'm blind in my left eye but I can still see this and she kind of helped me get it to the right area.

162
00:18:41,159 --> 00:18:43,300
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm almost blown away, but that is amazing.

163
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,261
[SPEAKER_00]: She's blind in one eye and she can see it.

164
00:18:45,421 --> 00:18:47,002
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a trip.

165
00:18:47,242 --> 00:18:48,743
[SPEAKER_00]: That is very, very cool.

166
00:18:49,783 --> 00:18:55,826
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Bobby, if you don't mind, I'm going to spend some time with Shane talking about what we talked about today, but we'll come back to you a little later, see if there's anything you want to add.

167
00:18:55,846 --> 00:18:57,327
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to jump in, just let me know.

168
00:18:57,687 --> 00:19:02,089
[SPEAKER_00]: We only have kind of one mic we're passing around here, you know, very ghetto, little portable kit.

169
00:19:02,129 --> 00:19:04,690
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, if the sound quality is bugging you, I apologize.

170
00:19:05,114 --> 00:19:09,035
[SPEAKER_00]: This is much, much different than the usual Sunday setup with a DarkSakura and Loki.

171
00:19:09,055 --> 00:19:13,156
[SPEAKER_00]: I do really, really want to make sure I do plug the one and only Bobby Blackwolf show, though.

172
00:19:13,236 --> 00:19:23,118
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure most people that are actually taking the time to listen this far into this already know about his show, but if you don't, he's on right before us, live on Sunday nights at All Games Radio, 5 o'clock Pacific, 8 o'clock Eastern.

173
00:19:23,459 --> 00:19:23,959
[SPEAKER_00]: Check it out.

174
00:19:24,859 --> 00:19:26,319
[SPEAKER_00]: Miklatov, Shane, how you doing?

175
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:28,440
[SPEAKER_00]: Barely awake.

176
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:30,480
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm sorry.

177
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,301
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we're keeping you up very late, but did you have a good day at E3 today?

178
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:43,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, despite the fact that it wasn't the day we played the 3DS, I think today was a little bit more fun, so that's how E3 should go, I guess.

179
00:19:44,476 --> 00:19:55,584
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, well Shane and I kind of made a list of everything we either kind of spent a long time looking at and got a tour through, or we actually got some hands-on time and played, so you want to go through this list a little bit, Shane?

180
00:19:56,244 --> 00:19:59,146
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start off with a game that kind of really...

181
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:01,731
[SPEAKER_00]: surprised me with how much I liked it.

182
00:20:01,811 --> 00:20:02,814
[SPEAKER_00]: DC Universe.

183
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:04,940
[SPEAKER_00]: What did you think about DC Universe, Shane?

184
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,671
[SPEAKER_02]: It was actually very fun.

185
00:20:08,912 --> 00:20:15,177
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing with DC Universe that I was skeptical about is it's yet another superhero MMO.

186
00:20:15,818 --> 00:20:26,206
[SPEAKER_02]: There seems to be a whole lot of those out there these days, but this one was more action and you don't really find that in MMOs.

187
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:29,968
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still the same sort of World of Warcraft style.

188
00:20:30,089 --> 00:20:35,773
[SPEAKER_02]: You target an enemy and then you stand around and you hit a button and then you attack and then you wait

189
00:20:36,033 --> 00:20:36,894
[SPEAKER_02]: and then you attack again.

190
00:20:37,274 --> 00:20:42,897
[SPEAKER_02]: This one, I was flying around, running around, jumping, bashing things in the head, freezing them.

191
00:20:42,977 --> 00:20:43,617
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really fun.

192
00:20:44,858 --> 00:20:50,221
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I love the fact that it was a little more action-based and the demo we got to play was a PvP demo and it was really cool.

193
00:20:50,241 --> 00:20:52,883
[SPEAKER_00]: The guy that was demoing it was showing us all these tricks and

194
00:20:53,305 --> 00:20:57,007
[SPEAKER_00]: I gotta say, you know, it was kind of like Phantasy Star Online, but on speed, to me.

195
00:20:57,027 --> 00:21:03,732
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, like, when I think action MMOs, like, there's not a lot I've really played except for Phantasy Star, you know, Online and Phantasy Star Universe.

196
00:21:03,772 --> 00:21:06,493
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was kind of like that, but really fast-paced.

197
00:21:06,894 --> 00:21:12,958
[SPEAKER_00]: And then kind of with that Warcraft twist, where you do have, you know, bars full of spells and things that you could use.

198
00:21:13,298 --> 00:21:15,519
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm curious to see kind of what the single-player mode looks like.

199
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,961
[SPEAKER_00]: I will tell you one little tidbit we picked up on, though.

200
00:21:18,281 --> 00:21:22,744
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if this is out there completely yet, but the PlayStation 3 and the PC versions...

201
00:21:23,194 --> 00:21:24,755
[SPEAKER_00]: are not going to play together.

202
00:21:25,496 --> 00:21:28,258
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a lot of people speculated, they will, at least initially.

203
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:34,362
[SPEAKER_00]: I get the feeling from the little demo we had that that's something that they might want to try to add in later.

204
00:21:34,823 --> 00:21:44,030
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the developers kind of think they can pull it off, but I think it's also kind of like, I guess they have other balancing things because it's two different systems or what have you.

205
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:49,994
[SPEAKER_00]: So if one of you was going to get that on PS3 and the other was on PC, do note you can't play together right off the bat.

206
00:21:50,054 --> 00:21:50,935
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's something

207
00:21:51,437 --> 00:21:53,779
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of folks are going to want to take into consideration, yeah?

208
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,701
[SPEAKER_00]: So, cool, DC Universe.

209
00:21:55,721 --> 00:21:56,161
[SPEAKER_00]: When's that out?

210
00:21:56,181 --> 00:21:57,983
[SPEAKER_00]: That was out, what, November 2nd, I think they said?

211
00:21:58,837 --> 00:22:00,178
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, how about Dead Rising 2, Shane?

212
00:22:01,598 --> 00:22:11,403
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me preface this with I am scared to death of zombies and the like, and I decided to, you know, face my fears, play some Dead Rising 2.

213
00:22:11,443 --> 00:22:14,804
[SPEAKER_02]: The game is really fun, very hilarious.

214
00:22:16,005 --> 00:22:16,485
[SPEAKER_02]: What's his name?

215
00:22:16,525 --> 00:22:18,866
[SPEAKER_02]: Chuck Green, I think, is the main character you play as.

216
00:22:19,907 --> 00:22:22,168
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely dressed him up in some women's clothing.

217
00:22:22,668 --> 00:22:23,369
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a really good time.

218
00:22:23,389 --> 00:22:25,250
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually think I want to get this game now too.

219
00:22:47,284 --> 00:22:55,208
[SPEAKER_00]: I gotta admit, it did look a little more of the same with the first one to me, but upgraded in the way that sequels should be upgraded.

220
00:22:55,408 --> 00:23:00,451
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a little more camp in some ways, which I think is what everybody really appreciated about the first game.

221
00:23:01,311 --> 00:23:05,093
[SPEAKER_00]: The main character that they have now definitely seemed likable enough.

222
00:23:05,113 --> 00:23:07,814
[SPEAKER_00]: I think people are going to get a kick out of the environment especially.

223
00:23:07,834 --> 00:23:14,658
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the whole Vegas-y, Fortune City or whatever they're calling it, the Vegas-like environment, I think a lot of people are really going to get a kick out of.

224
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:16,943
[SPEAKER_00]: LittleBigPlanet2.

225
00:23:17,083 --> 00:23:19,769
[SPEAKER_00]: Shane, tell them a little bit about what we did in that game, LittleBigPlanet2.

226
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:27,035
[SPEAKER_02]: The level they gave us was somewhat of a race level, trying to reach the top before the time limit.

227
00:23:27,075 --> 00:23:29,257
[SPEAKER_02]: We failed, but it still let us keep going.

228
00:23:30,558 --> 00:23:36,483
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember a game that had made me smile and laugh so much while I was playing.

229
00:23:37,844 --> 00:23:47,132
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really got a charm about it that just makes you want to play more, which sucked because the demo, to me, felt so short, but I know we were playing that thing for like five minutes at least.

230
00:23:48,564 --> 00:23:56,391
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think one important thing to note is that, you know, it really did kind of just look and felt like the first game, you know, speaking of kind of, you know, games that are more of the same.

231
00:23:56,811 --> 00:24:05,838
[SPEAKER_00]: But you guys all know that the big innovation in LittleBigPlanet 2 is kind of what they're letting you do now, you know, the expansion of the creation engine, which is, you know, really the biggest part.

232
00:24:06,359 --> 00:24:09,421
[SPEAKER_00]: And the part Shane left out about the race is it was all about grappling hooks.

233
00:24:09,641 --> 00:24:17,408
[SPEAKER_00]: And the part of what made it really funny is that, you know, if Shane would be kind of like trying to grab onto something, I could actually use my grappling hook to grab onto him.

234
00:24:18,362 --> 00:24:21,083
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was kind of like the physics was really good, I thought.

235
00:24:21,483 --> 00:24:29,847
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was, you know, kind of the impressive part of the demo is that they got the physics kind of of all that complicated grappling and grappling that type of stuff down.

236
00:24:29,927 --> 00:24:31,148
[SPEAKER_00]: So, good times.

237
00:24:32,228 --> 00:24:37,570
[SPEAKER_00]: So, LittleBigPlanet 2, I mean, I think a lot of you guys that liked the first one were probably already going to check that out, and rightfully so.

238
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:42,352
[SPEAKER_00]: Tron, I played the new Tron game, Tron Evolution, I believe it's called, on the 360.

239
00:24:43,673 --> 00:24:46,174
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, the version I played is the PS3, but, you know, same, same.

240
00:24:46,953 --> 00:24:49,374
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, guys, it's Tron meets Prince of Persia.

241
00:24:49,674 --> 00:24:51,135
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, that's really what it felt like to me.

242
00:24:51,455 --> 00:24:59,758
[SPEAKER_00]: You have the running up and wall jumping that you do, and, like, seriously, the tutorial stage felt almost just like that first Prince of Persia tutorial stage.

243
00:25:00,479 --> 00:25:06,221
[SPEAKER_00]: The battle mechanics, though, of course, are a lot different because, you know, you're not really using a sword.

244
00:25:06,781 --> 00:25:16,165
[SPEAKER_00]: The battle almost felt a little more like Bayonetta to me because, like, I could just practically button mash and do all this cool shit, and there was, like, bullet time and all this, you know, kind of crazy stuff.

245
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:21,540
[SPEAKER_00]: The graphics were simple, but that's what Tron's supposed to be.

246
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,061
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very true to the movie.

247
00:25:24,441 --> 00:25:29,903
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of hard for me to hear in the tunnel that they had Tron in this big neon kind of tunnel looking thing.

248
00:25:29,923 --> 00:25:31,284
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a very, very cool setup.

249
00:25:31,344 --> 00:25:33,505
[SPEAKER_00]: Props to them, whoever designed that booth.

250
00:25:36,174 --> 00:25:44,919
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very loud in there, but it sounded like the music I could hear was kind of a repeat of the Daft Punk score that's supposed to be in the movie, and the music sounded like it was really good.

251
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:53,805
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I'm kind of evaluating that on a very quick demo and what I think I heard, but hopefully a lot of the cool score will carry over.

252
00:25:54,164 --> 00:25:54,905
[SPEAKER_00]: I did have fun with it.

253
00:25:54,945 --> 00:25:58,970
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought for an action-y game, it was a pretty cool little button masher and it's Tron.

254
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:04,977
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, Shane, you don't even know the Tron movie or what have you, so did this game do anything for you?

255
00:26:05,057 --> 00:26:06,179
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you just watch me play, but...

256
00:26:07,228 --> 00:26:09,449
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, to be honest, not really.

257
00:26:09,749 --> 00:26:11,890
[SPEAKER_02]: It seemed really bland.

258
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:19,453
[SPEAKER_02]: The graphics weren't that great, especially considering the Wii one was right next to it, and it's kind of hard to tell the difference between the two.

259
00:26:21,294 --> 00:26:24,595
[SPEAKER_02]: And the environments were just really, really dull.

260
00:26:25,575 --> 00:26:26,656
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a whole bunch of black.

261
00:26:27,376 --> 00:26:34,978
[SPEAKER_02]: Blue, which, shockingly, you know, you'd think I'd like, but it was just, I don't know, it didn't look like a lot of effort had been put into making the game.

262
00:26:35,018 --> 00:26:41,739
[SPEAKER_02]: But that also might be the way the Tron series is, but that doesn't translate well for a big, flashy video game.

263
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:45,980
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, see, I could tell the difference right away between the Xbox and the Wii one.

264
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:52,722
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, for one, the Wii was all the light cycle racing, and I guess there's some of that in the 360 and PS3 one as well, but I don't know.

265
00:26:53,042 --> 00:26:55,143
[SPEAKER_00]: It definitely looks sharper to me, and I don't know.

266
00:26:55,183 --> 00:26:56,083
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what Shane's smoking.

267
00:26:56,123 --> 00:26:56,723
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it'll look fine.

268
00:26:57,165 --> 00:27:04,168
[SPEAKER_00]: But I guess, you know, if you don't know Tron at home listening, then you're probably going to kind of look at this the same way.

269
00:27:04,208 --> 00:27:13,311
[SPEAKER_00]: But for those of you that are fans of Tron, like me, you're going to go like, oh, that's cool, because you're throwing discs all over and doing these hops and bullet times and woo, special effects.

270
00:27:14,432 --> 00:27:15,032
[SPEAKER_00]: Epic Mickey.

271
00:27:15,832 --> 00:27:21,174
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of had to watch one of the Disney employees play this, but we definitely saw quite a bit of this game.

272
00:27:21,534 --> 00:27:23,435
[SPEAKER_00]: Shane, what did you think of Epic Mickey?

273
00:27:24,795 --> 00:27:28,878
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked like a really solid platformer style game.

274
00:27:29,998 --> 00:27:41,966
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the thing that interests me the most, which is the one thing we didn't get to see a lot of, was the ability to erase and regenerate certain aspects of stages.

275
00:27:44,827 --> 00:27:57,952
[SPEAKER_02]: I did like the almost free-roaming little Tiki Hut section.

276
00:27:58,892 --> 00:28:04,594
[SPEAKER_02]: The 2D was okay, I think that was probably my least favorite, but it looked like a pretty interesting game.

277
00:28:05,848 --> 00:28:07,709
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally thought the 2D stuff looked kind of cool.

278
00:28:07,749 --> 00:28:13,750
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of looked like what maybe you'd see on an Xbox Live arcade game or something, which was something because the graphics on the Wii were really good.

279
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:15,391
[SPEAKER_00]: Bobby wants to jump in on Epic Mickey.

280
00:28:16,231 --> 00:28:17,131
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I played it.

281
00:28:17,872 --> 00:28:20,452
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, that's right, Mickey is epic.

282
00:28:21,293 --> 00:28:22,673
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't play any of the 2D stages.

283
00:28:22,753 --> 00:28:26,314
[SPEAKER_01]: I played because there was another guy that was there that did the first part of the demo and I'm like,

284
00:28:26,977 --> 00:28:28,778
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just continue from here because he had to run.

285
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:32,621
[SPEAKER_01]: But I battled some enemies and stuff.

286
00:28:33,882 --> 00:28:38,926
[SPEAKER_01]: Mickey can't directly hurt the enemies, really.

287
00:28:40,107 --> 00:28:42,869
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, you've got your paint and your thinner.

288
00:28:43,761 --> 00:28:53,129
[SPEAKER_01]: and you basically, if you throw enough paint at an enemy, it becomes your friend and starts fighting for you, kinda like minions in Overlord and stuff.

289
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:56,873
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think if you do enough thinner at them, then they go away.

290
00:28:57,846 --> 00:29:26,717
[SPEAKER_01]: and stuff but there's actually some other things you can pick up like one of the things that I did was pick up like a special item that was a TV and in order to distract the guard you threw the TV at him and so he sits on his bucket and starts watching Steamboat Willie on the TV and then you can get around him and then basically take him out because there's this boat that needs to be risen and so you need to get rid of the anchors that are holding it down and with the thinner but you need to get in there and so there's some puzzle elements and

291
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:36,796
[SPEAKER_01]: and then the boss, it wasn't really a boss but it was a harder enemy, essentially it has a can of paint in it and it paints its own shell.

292
00:29:37,597 --> 00:29:45,742
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically you fire paint at it to slow it down and then you fire thinner at it to get rid of its shell and then he's got a weak spot that you hit for massive damage.

293
00:29:46,323 --> 00:29:49,745
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you hit this weak spot three times then you beat him.

294
00:29:50,045 --> 00:29:54,248
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can also have other of your friend's

295
00:29:54,861 --> 00:30:06,012
[SPEAKER_01]: Help them and if you actually turn somebody to your side that has a can of thinner on them then they will, if they're your friend, they will throw thinner on the enemies and hurt them and stuff.

296
00:30:06,052 --> 00:30:09,256
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was really neat the way that they did it and it looks really good.

297
00:30:09,296 --> 00:30:12,519
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very smooth and stuff and it's still an early build.

298
00:30:13,347 --> 00:30:42,212
[SPEAKER_01]: but I had a lot of fun with it and it looks like they are because the guy told me Warren Spector is a huge Disney fanatic especially of the older stuff which is why you know the Steamboat Willie stuff is in there so he's really big on capturing the essence of Disney you know what really surprised me though just you know not knowing the old Disney as well as you know the contemporary stuff I was really surprised at how devious they let Mickey be in some parts like I don't know if you saw the part with the tiki masks

299
00:30:42,571 --> 00:30:47,913
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the very beginning, you know, there's a little quest that Mickey's given to go get Tiki masks.

300
00:30:48,534 --> 00:30:55,057
[SPEAKER_00]: And what he can do, he can go get the three masks and turn them in to the shopkeeper and, you know, the shopkeeper will reward him.

301
00:30:55,237 --> 00:31:01,439
[SPEAKER_00]: Or what you can do, you find one mask, you give it to the shopkeeper, and then the shopkeeper puts it in the back.

302
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:11,584
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you go walk around to the back of the building, use paint thinner on the building, you can walk in the back door, take that mask, go back out and give it back to him and say, I found another mask.

303
00:31:12,267 --> 00:31:15,730
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was kind of like, that, it just kind of struck me as odd.

304
00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:24,958
[SPEAKER_00]: I was always kind of like, I would have thought that, you know, Vaughn Disney would never let folks kind of portray Mickey in a negative light like that.

305
00:31:25,038 --> 00:31:30,362
[SPEAKER_00]: And his conscience or whatever, Gus or whatever that's kind of following around is like, wow, I'm surprised you do that, Mickey.

306
00:31:30,762 --> 00:31:32,644
[SPEAKER_00]: But it kind of makes him more bad.

307
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:38,864
[SPEAKER_00]: and you could kind of see that because his paint would be wearing off and that's why he kind of has that drippy look is because he had paint thinner.

308
00:31:39,164 --> 00:31:44,567
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was kind of surprised that you could kind of play it a little devious that Mickey didn't necessarily have to be all good.

309
00:31:44,987 --> 00:31:49,010
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought to me that's the most fascinating part of Epic Mickey is the fact that

310
00:31:49,551 --> 00:31:51,293
[SPEAKER_00]: Super Scribblenauts and The New Professor Layton

311
00:32:08,891 --> 00:32:13,014
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, to be honest, I was not going to play Super Scribblenauts.

312
00:32:13,074 --> 00:32:15,957
[SPEAKER_02]: It was an accident, thinking I was going to go play a different game.

313
00:32:16,897 --> 00:32:21,281
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm glad I did, because I somewhat liked the first Scribblenauts game.

314
00:32:22,121 --> 00:32:26,905
[SPEAKER_02]: Like everyone, I had a problem with the controls, and I always relied on anvils and...

315
00:32:28,126 --> 00:32:38,430
[SPEAKER_02]: LaserGuns to get through all the stages, but the nice lady at the demo station was showing me just some of the stuff I could do.

316
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:39,830
[SPEAKER_02]: She was like, put whatever you want.

317
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:41,771
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, well, I don't know what to put.

318
00:32:41,811 --> 00:32:46,273
[SPEAKER_02]: She's like, well, try, you know, big, purple, pregnant dragon.

319
00:32:46,333 --> 00:32:48,073
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, that's ridiculous, so okay.

320
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:49,454
[SPEAKER_02]: And sure enough,

321
00:32:50,234 --> 00:32:53,056
[SPEAKER_02]: Big Dragon comes out, has a little baby dragon.

322
00:32:53,636 --> 00:32:55,017
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, what the crap?

323
00:32:55,297 --> 00:32:58,739
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's like, OK, go back and put Friendly in there somewhere.

324
00:32:58,799 --> 00:32:59,400
[SPEAKER_02]: So I did that.

325
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,041
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the dragons fought each other.

326
00:33:01,061 --> 00:33:03,322
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, OK, that's pretty cool.

327
00:33:03,562 --> 00:33:13,008
[SPEAKER_02]: So with the controls being vastly improved and the inclusion of adjectives, it actually looks like a really, really fun game.

328
00:33:14,529 --> 00:33:21,090
[SPEAKER_02]: The other game I played was Professor Layton Unwound Future or something like that.

329
00:33:21,691 --> 00:33:23,171
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember exactly what it's called.

330
00:33:23,571 --> 00:33:26,031
[SPEAKER_02]: Newest Professor Layton game that's coming out this September apparently.

331
00:33:27,492 --> 00:33:28,772
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Professor Layton.

332
00:33:29,192 --> 00:33:31,193
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all you really need to know.

333
00:33:31,273 --> 00:33:31,813
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fun.

334
00:33:32,733 --> 00:33:39,454
[SPEAKER_02]: The one puzzle I did kind of stumped me a little bit and then the rep helped me out so I felt really dumb because I actually had it figured out.

335
00:33:39,474 --> 00:33:42,375
[SPEAKER_02]: I just was too chicken to pick the wrong answer.

336
00:33:44,996 --> 00:33:50,540
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess there's a new inclusion to the memo function when you're in a puzzle.

337
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:59,786
[SPEAKER_02]: You can actually draw in different colors and you can erase with an erase tool instead of just clearing the entire thing, which is very handy.

338
00:34:01,968 --> 00:34:05,550
[SPEAKER_02]: Both of those games, once again, I'm looking forward to.

339
00:34:06,111 --> 00:34:07,512
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely will get Professor Layton.

340
00:34:07,872 --> 00:34:12,215
[SPEAKER_02]: Scribblenauts is now on my list of things I definitely will consider getting.

341
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:19,401
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I gotta step it up and get through the rest of these games faster so we can actually get to bed, do you want to describe Ghost Trick real quick too?

342
00:34:19,441 --> 00:34:21,402
[SPEAKER_00]: I know this is from the guy who did Phoenix Wright?

343
00:34:22,322 --> 00:34:32,884
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a game where you're a ghost and you have to manipulate objects to alter characters' destiny, not destiny, fate.

344
00:34:33,464 --> 00:34:35,765
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, their fate, because usually the characters die.

345
00:34:36,325 --> 00:34:37,305
[SPEAKER_02]: At least they did in the demo.

346
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:41,507
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more puzzle than anything else.

347
00:34:42,887 --> 00:34:44,888
[SPEAKER_02]: Really interesting graphic style.

348
00:34:46,529 --> 00:34:47,609
[SPEAKER_02]: The demo stumped me.

349
00:34:47,669 --> 00:34:50,691
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of think I'm going to go back at some point tomorrow and try to beat it.

350
00:34:52,471 --> 00:34:58,534
[SPEAKER_02]: But it looks like another kind of brain teaser with lots of thinking involved from the same people that did Phoenix Wright.

351
00:35:00,194 --> 00:35:27,778
[SPEAKER_00]: um while he was playing some of those games I actually checked out GoldenEye uh the new GoldenEye game is actually on the floor it's kind of hard to find because Activision doesn't have a booth but Nintendo has it at their booth just only in a couple places um and I gotta fess up guys if you've listened to LR a long time you may already know this but uh I never really played GoldenEye 64 I just you know I didn't really have a Nintendo 64 until very late so I never really got into the craze until kind of a little later um so playing this on the Wii it was cool because it kind of you know

352
00:35:28,414 --> 00:35:29,855
[SPEAKER_00]: Old School Arcade Shooters

353
00:35:58,326 --> 00:36:01,109
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, very interesting that Activision is kind of taking this over now.

354
00:36:02,089 --> 00:36:09,575
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you only saw the game briefly, Shane Goldeneye, but did you notice anything lost in translation or anything?

355
00:36:09,596 --> 00:36:14,920
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, to me, it made a very seamless transition from being a rare game to, you know, whoever's developing it now.

356
00:36:16,711 --> 00:36:33,856
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing I noticed besides graphics that was a bit different, and this could just be my memory being a little bit hazy, but I do not remember the ability to climb on boxes and stuff like that, which was present in the demo we played.

357
00:36:34,296 --> 00:36:41,338
[SPEAKER_02]: But otherwise, it looked like a pretty faithful port of the Nintendo 64 one with some updated features.

358
00:36:42,678 --> 00:36:42,778
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

359
00:36:44,352 --> 00:36:46,934
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there'll be a lot of people listening to this that are going to be into that.

360
00:36:46,974 --> 00:36:49,435
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, I think about Bress Lowell and his love for Perfect Dark.

361
00:36:49,476 --> 00:36:51,337
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a game like this will be right up his alley.

362
00:36:52,097 --> 00:36:59,943
[SPEAKER_00]: Quickly talking about some of the other games, we quickly got to observe the Castlevania Xbox Live Arcade game, heavily influenced by Symphony of the Night.

363
00:37:00,663 --> 00:37:03,645
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of zoom-ins and outs on kind of the different stages.

364
00:37:03,725 --> 00:37:10,890
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like you have like 10 minutes to, and you can cooperatively or, you know, combatively, I guess you could say, against each other, kind of,

365
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:17,373
[SPEAKER_00]: Go after the boss but these stages seem to be very large and you kind of make your way towards the boss.

366
00:37:17,393 --> 00:37:19,899
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only really one stage in the demo that we could see but it

367
00:37:21,334 --> 00:37:22,415
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked interesting.

368
00:37:22,495 --> 00:37:22,855
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

369
00:37:22,875 --> 00:37:27,217
[SPEAKER_00]: I think because it's in the same vein as Symphony of the Night, it could be a lot of fun.

370
00:37:27,637 --> 00:37:32,560
[SPEAKER_00]: But it doesn't look like, and maybe I should have asked this, but it doesn't look like there's a lot of single player stuff.

371
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:36,562
[SPEAKER_00]: Although I imagine there might be time trials, things of that nature.

372
00:37:36,602 --> 00:37:36,922
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

373
00:37:37,222 --> 00:37:39,583
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't get to dig too deep into this game.

374
00:37:39,623 --> 00:37:43,505
[SPEAKER_00]: But Shane, anything from your quick, quick impressions of the Castlevania Xbox Live game?

375
00:37:43,765 --> 00:37:44,886
[SPEAKER_00]: Harmony of Despair, I think it is?

376
00:37:45,866 --> 00:37:46,766
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it looks like crap.

377
00:37:47,847 --> 00:37:48,767
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like the premise.

378
00:37:49,928 --> 00:37:52,309
[SPEAKER_02]: Graphically, they could have cleaned it up a little bit.

379
00:37:53,669 --> 00:37:56,950
[SPEAKER_02]: The guys we watched playing it clearly did not know what they were doing.

380
00:37:58,831 --> 00:38:02,392
[SPEAKER_02]: But the game also didn't seem to really give you much direction.

381
00:38:03,453 --> 00:38:03,773
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

382
00:38:04,013 --> 00:38:05,874
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it's something that they should have attempted.

383
00:38:07,929 --> 00:38:37,068
[SPEAKER_00]: I might give it a shot later on but it definitely kind of has that Neo Geo effect with all the zoom ins and outs but I thought it looked good and you know I'm a fan of anything inspired by Symphony of the Night so I don't know Shane you might want to give it a chance later here's a game I'm giving no chance at all Saw 2 god I watched Shane play the demo and like okay if you're eating something you might want to pause this for a minute okay okay so like in the very opening scene of the demo it's I think parodying a scene in the second movie I've never seen it but I've

384
00:38:37,475 --> 00:38:41,137
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard about it where like the guy has to basically like cut open his eye or whatever.

385
00:38:41,157 --> 00:38:42,398
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh God, it's so gross.

386
00:38:43,058 --> 00:38:46,280
[SPEAKER_00]: And like you actually have to, what were you doing that with a controller?

387
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,721
[SPEAKER_00]: Like actually like cutting the eye?

388
00:38:48,141 --> 00:38:50,382
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like, oh, this is so disgusting.

389
00:38:50,943 --> 00:38:52,503
[SPEAKER_00]: Shane, you described the demos.

390
00:38:54,780 --> 00:39:00,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I had said when I saw the Saw 2 game, I did not want to play the part where you cut open your eye.

391
00:39:00,743 --> 00:39:04,025
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, that's the first thing you do in the game, so I had to do it.

392
00:39:04,465 --> 00:39:06,626
[SPEAKER_02]: Grossed me the heck out.

393
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:13,250
[SPEAKER_02]: But, much like the first Saw game, the game is really about puzzles and trying to figure out stuff.

394
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:15,211
[SPEAKER_02]: and I love it.

395
00:39:15,871 --> 00:39:37,102
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of my replacement or not my replacement but just something to get me through the time when we don't have Silent Hill because it is still kind of scary and it's got the nice atmosphere but it's very gory and if you are at all squeamish I saw so many

396
00:39:37,722 --> 00:39:39,103
[SPEAKER_02]: Different things die.

397
00:39:39,583 --> 00:39:44,847
[SPEAKER_02]: During the five minutes I played of the demo, only one of them was me, thankfully.

398
00:39:45,248 --> 00:39:54,935
[SPEAKER_02]: The rest were cut little flashbacks to people getting impaled, sliced with a buzzsaw, all sorts of fun things.

399
00:39:56,336 --> 00:40:00,739
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it felt like a pretty good game again, and I cannot wait for it to come out.

400
00:40:01,159 --> 00:40:02,360
[SPEAKER_02]: But it is really gross.

401
00:40:04,562 --> 00:40:06,103
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the game I should show to my mother.

402
00:40:06,935 --> 00:40:08,576
[SPEAKER_00]: Be like, these are what video games are, Mom.

403
00:40:08,936 --> 00:40:09,877
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't you love these?

404
00:40:10,277 --> 00:40:15,721
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, how about... No, no, here's a game my mom would like, but I would never understand why.

405
00:40:16,542 --> 00:40:18,383
[SPEAKER_00]: Glee Karaoke Revolution.

406
00:40:19,624 --> 00:40:20,124
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

407
00:40:20,564 --> 00:40:21,745
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here's the thing, guys.

408
00:40:22,806 --> 00:40:25,368
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, it's Karaoke Revolution.

409
00:40:25,408 --> 00:40:27,689
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the little bars along the bottom that move with the pitch.

410
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:30,931
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just all the videos are Glee.

411
00:40:31,372 --> 00:40:34,454
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's really no interface whatsoever.

412
00:40:35,442 --> 00:40:43,647
[SPEAKER_00]: In the game itself, besides just the little pitch bars and a very, very light shell around that, there's no characters anymore.

413
00:40:43,967 --> 00:40:46,668
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as you remember in Karaoke Revolution, you'd have these venues and things.

414
00:40:46,749 --> 00:40:48,169
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope, you don't really have that anymore.

415
00:40:48,209 --> 00:41:00,476
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just videos from Glee that only kind of go with the songs because they'll try to show it synced up with how it was in the show, but since the songs in the show are shorter, they'll just throw in all these random clips.

416
00:41:02,437 --> 00:41:04,999
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was on the Wii, the version we were playing, so the video...

417
00:41:05,779 --> 00:41:07,040
[SPEAKER_00]: Quality was kind of poop.

418
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:19,450
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, I watched Glee in HD at home, you know, when I was watching the first few episodes, and I don't know, I just thought the game was just kind of... I was barely singing the song, and I got like five stars.

419
00:41:20,531 --> 00:41:24,494
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, granted, I was on the lowest difficulty, and it's probably dumbed down because it was a demo, blah, blah, blah.

420
00:41:24,955 --> 00:41:26,196
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just, I don't know.

421
00:41:27,077 --> 00:41:30,980
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I guess for the hardcore Glee fans, they'll be all over it, but I just thought it was...

422
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:39,615
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of one of those things where as you make a copy of a copy of a copy of a copy, it starts to wear down a little bit, and that's kind of where I was at with Glee Karaoke Revolution.

423
00:41:39,915 --> 00:41:41,436
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's a cute license idea.

424
00:41:41,676 --> 00:41:45,599
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's kind of one of those things where once we saw it, it's like, oh yeah, of course, of course there was going to be a Glee game.

425
00:41:46,179 --> 00:41:47,460
[SPEAKER_00]: Shane, were your thoughts different?

426
00:41:48,598 --> 00:41:51,280
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope, I also thought it was pretty terrible.

427
00:41:52,201 --> 00:42:08,055
[SPEAKER_02]: My problem with it is, and this is the same thing that's happened before, is that Konami buys rights to a very, very popular IP and then does not put any effort into it thinking that the brand name will sell itself.

428
00:42:08,895 --> 00:42:13,618
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, as we learned with the American Idol Karaoke Revolution games, that's not going to work.

429
00:42:15,659 --> 00:42:26,925
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a very, very good opportunity to make some money, but I just need to invest a little more because right now I don't see any potential in the game.

430
00:42:28,624 --> 00:42:37,608
[SPEAKER_00]: The sad thing is, though, Shane, I think it's going to sell very well because I think there'll be a lot of teenage girls that are like, I love Glee, and they'll buy the game on the Wii, and they don't look for the same stuff we do.

431
00:42:37,729 --> 00:42:41,771
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think you kind of have to take Shane and I's impressions of the game with a big grain of salt.

432
00:42:42,111 --> 00:42:43,832
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the game will still do really well.

433
00:42:43,892 --> 00:42:51,635
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not going to do well with people listening to or recording video game podcasts about other types of games.

434
00:42:51,675 --> 00:42:52,236
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?

435
00:42:52,716 --> 00:42:54,877
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an audience for this that's just not us.

436
00:42:55,973 --> 00:43:18,721
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, as someone who is a huge fan of Glee and has bought all five CDs, on the day they came out, no less, each one of them, all I would need is just a few minor tweaks to the interface, and I would actually be fine with, for the most part, what we saw.

437
00:43:19,381 --> 00:43:22,902
[SPEAKER_02]: It just doesn't feel like it's anywhere near done.

438
00:43:23,442 --> 00:43:24,783
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually hope that's the case.

439
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:27,991
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, just a couple quick ones.

440
00:43:28,011 --> 00:43:32,714
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll kind of wrap up talking about what was at Sega's booth and some of the things we saw there.

441
00:43:32,774 --> 00:43:37,656
[SPEAKER_00]: Sonic 4, Episode 1, I think it's pretty much what all of you are expecting.

442
00:43:37,737 --> 00:43:40,858
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like the old Sonic games, but with HD graphics.

443
00:43:40,978 --> 00:43:43,080
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really what it is.

444
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:44,701
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, what else can you say about it?

445
00:43:44,741 --> 00:43:46,542
[SPEAKER_00]: Either you've played the old games or you haven't.

446
00:43:46,882 --> 00:43:50,164
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, did you notice any minor tweaks that I might be overlooking, Shane?

447
00:43:51,964 --> 00:43:54,625
[SPEAKER_02]: When I played it, it really did feel like Sonic.

448
00:43:55,325 --> 00:44:00,266
[SPEAKER_02]: His animations are a little slow at the moment, but I overheard them saying that they were going to fix that.

449
00:44:01,627 --> 00:44:09,989
[SPEAKER_02]: The boss fight felt a little more complex than what I was used to from a Sonic game of that quality.

450
00:44:10,049 --> 00:44:11,650
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm pleased.

451
00:44:11,990 --> 00:44:13,270
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't wait for it to come out.

452
00:44:14,355 --> 00:44:19,577
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I also overheard them talk about, you know, well, we had to kind of take all this into evaluation and listen to the fans.

453
00:44:20,218 --> 00:44:26,180
[SPEAKER_00]: And they wanted Sonic to be able to accelerate faster from, you know, walking to, you know, running and, you know, all that stuff.

454
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:28,482
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was just kind of like, okay, yeah, that's great.

455
00:44:28,542 --> 00:44:32,083
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think on most people, sadly, that type of effort will probably be lost.

456
00:44:32,103 --> 00:44:35,645
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I think a lot of people are going to have that same type of reaction where it's like, oh, hey, it's Sonic 2 but HD.

457
00:44:35,985 --> 00:44:36,765
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's not a bad thing.

458
00:44:37,065 --> 00:44:40,267
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the old Sonic games were when they were really the best.

459
00:44:41,255 --> 00:44:55,965
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, alright, Phantasy Star Portable 2, I, I don't know, it was pretty much just like the first one to me, I didn't get to ask a lot of questions on that, I really wanted to see if the pizza box was still there, but, uh, I don't know, Shane, did you notice anything different, really?

460
00:44:56,266 --> 00:44:58,327
[SPEAKER_00]: Except not being able to skip cutscenes.

461
00:44:59,985 --> 00:45:06,169
[SPEAKER_02]: The only addition that they've really made, it seems, is the ability to roll around and dodge.

462
00:45:07,630 --> 00:45:11,553
[SPEAKER_02]: Which, you know, if you were like me and downloaded the Japanese trial, you already knew that.

463
00:45:13,055 --> 00:45:14,996
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, it's pretty much the same game.

464
00:45:16,137 --> 00:45:24,403
[SPEAKER_02]: From what I understand, they had somewhat famous, I think, manga or anime artists in Japan do the new character designs.

465
00:45:24,904 --> 00:45:26,065
[SPEAKER_02]: They need to never do that again.

466
00:45:26,745 --> 00:45:28,827
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they've made the characters worse looking.

467
00:45:30,834 --> 00:45:33,140
[SPEAKER_00]: Aren't a lot of the characters just kind of copied from old games?

468
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:38,634
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I swear that shark you were fighting in the very beginning was like the same damn thing that was in the Dreamcast PSO.

469
00:45:40,196 --> 00:45:42,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are completely different.

470
00:45:42,117 --> 00:45:44,698
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking about the characters you can create yourself.

471
00:45:45,779 --> 00:45:50,461
[SPEAKER_02]: They changed the faces, they changed the costumes.

472
00:45:51,341 --> 00:45:53,362
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't look nearly as good, I think.

473
00:45:54,402 --> 00:45:56,904
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, your character looked kind of cool to me, at least the one I saw.

474
00:45:56,924 --> 00:45:59,165
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't think it was terrible.

475
00:46:00,705 --> 00:46:03,466
[SPEAKER_02]: After spending a lot of time with the character creator in the first game...

476
00:46:05,279 --> 00:46:08,261
[SPEAKER_02]: To me, I noticed how bad... It's really the faces.

477
00:46:08,341 --> 00:46:09,961
[SPEAKER_02]: The faces look really terrible.

478
00:46:11,562 --> 00:46:16,445
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, I guess we'll close out today with a game I know Bobby had wanted to say something to on at some point.

479
00:46:16,485 --> 00:46:17,765
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also at Sega's booth.

480
00:46:18,226 --> 00:46:20,587
[SPEAKER_00]: But Sega was also showing off some iPads.

481
00:46:21,247 --> 00:46:25,309
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the iPads had Super Monkey Ball 2 on the iPad.

482
00:46:25,349 --> 00:46:27,930
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know I think all of us got a chance to touch that game.

483
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:29,031
[SPEAKER_00]: Shane, we'll start with you.

484
00:46:29,051 --> 00:46:30,952
[SPEAKER_00]: What did you think of Super Monkey Ball 2 on the iPad?

485
00:46:32,174 --> 00:46:34,476
[SPEAKER_02]: The theme for tonight is, I guess, I hated it.

486
00:46:36,497 --> 00:46:38,298
[SPEAKER_02]: It just controlled like crap.

487
00:46:38,799 --> 00:46:44,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, my phone, my iPhone plays Monkey Ball better than that iPad demo that they had.

488
00:46:45,423 --> 00:46:46,244
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not impressed.

489
00:46:46,464 --> 00:46:47,925
[SPEAKER_02]: Not making me want to buy an iPad.

490
00:46:48,005 --> 00:46:49,967
[SPEAKER_02]: Not making me want to download another Monkey Ball game.

491
00:46:51,468 --> 00:46:54,169
[SPEAKER_00]: Bobby, was the demo lost on you too?

492
00:46:55,610 --> 00:46:56,171
[SPEAKER_00]: It's shit.

493
00:46:59,113 --> 00:47:01,713
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I got the controls pretty quick.

494
00:47:01,773 --> 00:47:03,874
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that little device was calibrated weird.

495
00:47:03,934 --> 00:47:09,535
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the end of the day, I was like, yeah, Monkey Ball was better a long time ago.

496
00:47:10,435 --> 00:47:11,655
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this one's going to be a pass.

497
00:47:12,015 --> 00:47:13,376
[SPEAKER_00]: So there you go.

498
00:47:14,096 --> 00:47:17,336
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess we're going to go ahead and kind of wrap up for the night because I think we're ready to go to bed.

499
00:47:17,416 --> 00:47:20,037
[SPEAKER_00]: God, it's like already 1.30 and I still got to get this uploaded.

500
00:47:20,397 --> 00:47:26,498
[SPEAKER_00]: But thanks for staying up with us or whatever time of day it is where you are and listening to the little wrap up today.

501
00:47:27,058 --> 00:47:29,181
