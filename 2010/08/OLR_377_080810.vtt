Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:12.000
With your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky, and Lowkey

00:13.000 --> 00:21.000
Tonight, August 8th, 2010, Kinect may not be available for Indie games. Soon you can play video games with your eyes.

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
And a warning for all Starcraft 2 players.

00:24.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:37.000
Hello my friends and welcome to episode number 377 of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:37.000 --> 00:41.000
We are that video game talk show where every gamer has a voice.

00:41.000 --> 00:48.000
My name is Rob Roberts. I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host, the one and only, knocking stuff over.

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
She reaches for her mic. Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

00:51.000 --> 00:56.000
How you doing? Why are you so angry? Why are you mad though?

00:56.000 --> 01:03.000
Because I made a boo boo and this thing is trying to get rid of this stupid thing.

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
You made a boo boo? Please, let's revel in what mistakes you've made.

01:08.000 --> 01:14.000
I got that security shield thing because I hit space.

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
So my security shield, is that one of those spammy spam spammers programs?

01:19.000 --> 01:25.000
It's called a rogue anti-spyware when it's really the worst kind of spyware there is.

01:25.000 --> 01:31.000
So it's spyware disguised as anti-spyware. It's the type of thing my mom would have all over her computer.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
Yeah, and I'm trying to get rid of it without having to reboot.

01:34.000 --> 01:39.000
So word of warning to those folks out there. Watch what you hit the space bar on.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
I know right. Just because it looks like your windows doesn't mean it's right.

01:41.000 --> 01:47.000
And I was actually right in the middle of typing to somebody on AIM when it popped up.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
I hate that. Because I use the space bar for everything.

01:50.000 --> 01:55.000
Right, of course. Alright, not joining us tonight is Tech Master Loki.

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
Of course, if you were listening to last week's show, he had a baby last week.

01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
So he's on baby leave for a little while. We'll let you know when he's going to come back.

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
But filling in for Loki in the meantime, not replacing Loki because Loki is irreplaceable.

02:06.000 --> 02:12.000
But filling in for Loki, say hello to, we've missed this guy too because it's been a while since he's been on the show.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
Say hello to Dan the Man. How you doing Dan?

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
I'm kind of on the show like every week or two.

02:18.000 --> 02:22.000
Well you do drop in and say hello, but you don't sit in on the show like you're doing tonight.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
I get to sit at my own desk.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
I know, instead of Loki taking up the chair, it's you.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
Awesome.

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
So the listeners heard you had a rough week last week. How you doing though?

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
Not really.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
Yeah?

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
I feel like before.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
I'm sorry, not this last week.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
It was last week.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
Whatever.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
I'm good.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
You're good. Feeling good?

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
Yeah.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
Alright. Are you feeling beautiful?

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
Of course.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
I just had to throw him a curve ball.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
And awesome.

02:48.000 --> 02:53.000
Alright. Dan is going to be helping out while Loki's on vacation because it's really easy for Dan to help out because he lives here.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
So, you know, he's usually pretty readily available.

02:56.000 --> 03:02.000
So Dan will be filling in until Loki decides he's going to come back, which I hope he does decide to come back at some point.

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
Because I got to admit, there's that part of me that's always wondered.

03:05.000 --> 03:10.000
You know, when Loki has this baby, is he going to want to do a little radio show on the internet anymore?

03:10.000 --> 03:15.000
Or is he going to worry that the stuff he says on this show his kid might hear someday? I don't know.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
That would be awfully pathetic.

03:17.000 --> 03:22.000
No, I'm positive he will come back, but he can take all the time he needs.

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
Alright. Well, we'll get back to Dan in a little while.

03:25.000 --> 03:30.000
But I want to introduce somebody else to you guys because we have a guest in the studio tonight too.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
And we're really glad to have her.

03:32.000 --> 03:39.000
It's the second time she's been on the show and she probably would be one of the few guests that come.

03:39.000 --> 03:45.000
I can only think of maybe two or three guests that have traveled further than she has to be on the show.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
Say hello, everybody, to Misty is here tonight.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
Howdy, y'all.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
How you doing, Misty?

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
I'm doing good.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
Alright, excellent.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
So, let's see, for those that haven't, when was the last time you were on the show?

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
It was about a year ago-ish?

03:57.000 --> 04:02.000
No, due to stuff happening last time, we never even got to do a pre-taped segment.

04:02.000 --> 04:06.000
So this is my first time, just my second time being in Dan and Jamie's house.

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
I thought for some reason you were on a show. Oh, we did like a pre-taped thing or something, huh?

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
We didn't even get to that last time.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
Really?

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
Really.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
I thought you should have been on a show before.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
Yeah, Rob.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
Yeah.

04:17.000 --> 04:22.000
Well, okay, after 377 episodes, they all start to blur a little bit, okay? Give me a break.

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
Alright, well anyway, then welcome to the show at BSMA.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
But you've called in before and all that good stuff, so hopefully the listeners know you.

04:28.000 --> 04:34.000
And also, a lot of listeners may have not heard you because you don't call in every week.

04:34.000 --> 04:40.000
But you have a presence on the website, and you've been following the Twitters, and I know you've always been a big supporter of the show.

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
So thank you, first off, for being such a supporter of OLR over the years.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
When did you first start listening? It's been a while, right?

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
Episode 91.

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
Wow, that's some time ago. Alright.

04:50.000 --> 04:56.000
What is the best thing about Orange Lounge Radio, you think? Just to inflate our egos a little bit?

04:56.000 --> 05:06.000
Again, it's back more toward the DDR in random days. Of course, the tangents that pop up now still make it worth it.

05:06.000 --> 05:18.000
You know, I've kind of heard that, that even though we're not a music-based game show anymore, kind of like the community that still lives on because of that, I've definitely heard is like a thing that people like about the show.

05:18.000 --> 05:28.000
And certainly, you know, as much as I've hated on a lot of the recent games that that same company's put out that gave us DDR, obviously the show wouldn't exist if it weren't for that.

05:28.000 --> 05:36.000
And for that, I will always be thankful, and they'll always be a part of me that wants to play those games as crappy as they are these days.

05:36.000 --> 05:40.000
Alright, anyhow, so Misty will be joining us, and we'll talk to her a little more a little later.

05:40.000 --> 05:46.000
But we're going to get into a little bit of how was your gaming week, because we always start off the show talking about our gaming weeks and what we've been playing.

05:46.000 --> 05:53.000
So let's go over to DarkSakura. What have you been playing besides Download, Add-A-Wear, and Spybot as quickly as possible?

05:53.000 --> 06:06.000
Well, I played some Ragnarok and Star Trek online, as usual, and then I made Dan play stuff for me so I could watch, because my hand still hurts a lot.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
Oh, that's right. You still have the hand thing going on.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
But it's not seeping joint fluid anymore.

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
Yeah, actually, I can stand to look at it now. I get very squeamish with the whole blood thing.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
You can touch it.

06:15.000 --> 06:19.000
I don't want to touch it. I don't want to touch it. Why?

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
Because it's not gross.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
I meant to slide the hole, not the hole.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
Oh, I touched the hole.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
Rob touched the hole.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
I touched Jamie's hole. Sorry, Dan.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
Alright.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
No problem.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
Alright.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
Oh, Rob.

06:36.000 --> 06:41.000
At least the hole's in your hand and not in your head.

06:41.000 --> 06:45.000
But Dan played the games for me so that I could watch and then go, what?

06:45.000 --> 06:49.000
Alright. Well, Dan, we'll skip on over to you. What kind of games have you been playing this week?

06:49.000 --> 06:53.000
I've been playing Hydra Thunder Hurricane, which is awesome.

06:53.000 --> 06:58.000
Why is it awesome? Because I downloaded it and I was like, this just isn't the same.

06:58.000 --> 07:03.000
Because I love jet boat racing. I don't understand why, but it's awesome.

07:03.000 --> 07:11.000
I can, like, jump my boat, break things, win races, go online, get my ass kicked. It's amazing.

07:11.000 --> 07:16.000
Why is it that everybody online is better than me? Like, I can't figure this out.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
Like, it doesn't matter what game I play.

07:18.000 --> 07:24.000
And is it just me, guys? Whenever I go online and play a game online, I am always in last place.

07:24.000 --> 07:29.000
Unless it's not.

07:29.000 --> 07:35.000
See, she didn't have a mic. Room spontaneously combusts into laughter in a while.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
That's the way Mystique works.

07:37.000 --> 07:42.000
Yeah, she's Mystique. Stop it. We're doing a radio show.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
She doesn't care.

07:44.000 --> 07:49.000
Dan and Jamie's friend, Mystique, she's funny and she ran in here and just whispered,

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
you know, I said, why do I always come in last? She just came in here and whispered,

07:52.000 --> 07:56.000
it's because you're gay. And that's why everybody started laughing.

07:56.000 --> 08:00.000
Because she came in here and gave the thumbs up. So anyway, we got to get her mic.

08:00.000 --> 08:04.000
We got to get a wireless mic for Mystique so that way when she runs in and out, we'll still get her.

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
Anyway, where was I? See, now I got lost.

08:07.000 --> 08:11.000
Thanks Mystique for derailing the whole goddamn show.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
We're talking about my gaming week.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
Oh, yes.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
We decided to lament the fact that you suck at games online.

08:15.000 --> 08:19.000
Yes, I suck at video games online. Why is it Halo? Last place.

08:19.000 --> 08:24.000
I would think partially because the only game I'll typically play online is Rock Band 2.

08:24.000 --> 08:28.000
I do okay with the music games. DDR, like UltraMix back in the day.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
I would kick your ass at UltraMix. I will.

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
But there were some very scary people that could even beat me.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
But that's one of the few.

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
But like, okay, Blur. Have you played Blur? The online racing game?

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
Have you played it online at all against other people?

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
No.

08:41.000 --> 08:47.000
Usually I do really shitty, but one time, one time I actually won a race.

08:47.000 --> 08:51.000
I won a race against like 10 other people and I was so excited.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
I'll admit, I felt a little tingle down there.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
I was so excited.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
Wow.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
And that's like the only time that's ever happened.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
Alright.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
And that new downloadable Castlevania.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
How is the new downloadable Castlevania?

09:05.000 --> 09:09.000
Well, I only played the trial, so it's interesting.

09:09.000 --> 09:16.000
It seems like it'd probably be really cool with a crew of people, but by yourself, not very fun.

09:16.000 --> 09:20.000
I've heard it's an awesome multiplayer game, but I have yet to experience the multiplayer.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
Did you download it?

09:22.000 --> 09:27.000
I checked out the demo for a little bit and I played it at E3 a few months ago.

09:27.000 --> 09:32.000
And when I was at E3, I was like, this game's kind of weird, but it's kind of interesting and fun.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
And when I downloaded it, I was like, yeah, this is still kind of weird.

09:35.000 --> 09:39.000
The thing I don't like about the game, and I don't like games that do this,

09:39.000 --> 09:45.000
is that the game really just throws you in with no description whatsoever.

09:45.000 --> 09:50.000
And look, guys, I realize most Atari 2600 games and NES games back in the day did the same thing.

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
Like Mario doesn't tell you what to do.

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
But games were less complicated back then.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
It takes a second.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
And there's so many buttons and stuff.

10:00.000 --> 10:05.000
Usually I need a little bit of a tutorial, but all I see in Castlevania is boss.

10:05.000 --> 10:09.000
And I'm like, okay, I'll go do that.

10:09.000 --> 10:13.000
But then every time I think I know the way to the boss, there's a fucking wall there or something.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
I'm like, why didn't I see that when I was looking at the whole map?

10:16.000 --> 10:20.000
It seems to be my new four people who are going to download it, it'd be worth my money.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
But is it 15?

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
It is 15. That's where it's at now.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
If it was 10 bucks, it'd be almost an automatic anyway.

10:27.000 --> 10:32.000
The $15 thing, except for a game like Hurricane, which is obviously an undertaking,

10:32.000 --> 10:36.000
it seems to me like that's a little excessive for Castlevania.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
All right, I'm going to go to the chat room, because chat rooms are filling up with comments here.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
chat.orangelandsradio.com

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
We love our chatters, and every week they join us here.

10:44.000 --> 10:48.000
Let's see, TigerClaw is going to start us off tonight saying, in response to the

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
Why Do I Always Lose Online,

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
Sky, it's simple, they've been playing the game a whole lot.

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
If you're someone who plays casual, you'll get your ass kicked online.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
Yeah, pretty much.

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
He also goes on to say, I haven't played Starcraft 2 online yet,

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
knowing I'll just get my ass whooped.

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
I want to play it online, but only doing co-op games.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
That's kind of how I feel about a lot of that stuff, too.

11:08.000 --> 11:13.000
But yet, I play World of Warcraft, and I actually really enjoy PVP and World of Warcraft.

11:13.000 --> 11:17.000
But that's, World of Warcraft's not like other games.

11:17.000 --> 11:21.000
It's really not. Games like that, their MMOs are in a little bubble of their own.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
They're not like other stuff.

11:23.000 --> 11:27.000
Leo Shannon in our chat says, Rob, try BlazBlue, whatever you want to say, CS.

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
They have a beginner mode that works with online mode.

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
You can button mash your way to victory.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
Sounds good to me. There you go.

11:35.000 --> 11:41.000
And Amaze Satsuma chimes in and says,

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
New Castlevania does have a good multiplayer game.

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
There you go.

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
Hello? Hi.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
And now your mic is ruined again.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
How about this?

11:54.000 --> 11:58.000
I was explaining to Dan why we can't have more than three people in the chat room.

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
Because the moment number four pops in, boot.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
Is Misty on 3G, though? Are you on 3G?

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
No, I'm on Wi-Fi.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
Can you switch to 3G or will your app stop working?

12:06.000 --> 12:10.000
It's all Wi-Fi for mine. Remember, I have no fancy iPhone.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
Oh, that's right. You have an iPhone.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
It looks like an iPhone.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
That's right. I'll live.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
Dan, you can look over here.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
It's always there.

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
Anyway, chat.orangeonshade.com if you want to chat with the host.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
Except for Dan, because he can't get in.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
Screw you people.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
You have a mic. Why do you need IRC?

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
So I can see what people are saying.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
He wants to know when people are talking shit about him.

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
If people are talking shit, I'll let you know.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
Holy crap.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
You okay there?

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
Oh, I was running Hijack This to see if I could find it,

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
but there's way too many things that are running.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
Jamie's computer is super broken.

12:44.000 --> 12:47.000
Jamie has downloaded like seven anti-spyware programs

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
since the time I sat down in this chair.

12:49.000 --> 12:52.000
I just downloaded Hijack This and Attawear, but haven't rebooted.

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
She doesn't just want to remove the spyware from her computer.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
She wants to obliterate it.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
She wants to wipe it off the base of the planet.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
You will die.

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
I've already deleted a whole bunch of its DLLs

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
and stopped the process from running.

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
Because Jamie steals so much crap off the internet.

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
Jamie's going to show up at the front door of the company

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
that made this with her iron fists.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
Somebody's going to get face pummeled.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
I want her not to go to the porn websites.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
But no!

13:20.000 --> 13:24.000
For the record, I was going to a site that explained

13:24.000 --> 13:27.000
the history of gay people in the Old Testament.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
Porn!

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
Okay.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
I don't know why you're giving her shit about it, Dan.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
You made her download it.

13:33.000 --> 13:37.000
I wanted to read the article and instead it did this shit to me.

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
I was trying to be conscientious!

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
I get my porn from other websites.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
I get my porn from kicking you.

13:44.000 --> 13:48.000
Alright, anything else that you played this week, Dan?

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
I played a bunch of Genesis games

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
because my wife was like, play Genesis games!

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
Yeah, I heard there was Sega Night last night.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
Yeah, I don't know.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
All I know is Jamie wanted me to get beat

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
because she picked every one of the hardest Genesis games

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
and was like, play this, play this.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
Finally she goes back for another batch of games

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
and I'm like, if she comes back with Gunstar Heroes

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
I'm going to shoot her.

14:07.000 --> 14:10.000
And she came back with Gunstar Heroes.

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000
What was the other game that I brought?

14:13.000 --> 14:16.000
I don't remember what the other one was.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
Oh, no, it wasn't Midnight Resistance.

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
It was something else difficult.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
But the games that I brought out were...

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
Well, it was Robo-Lest and Silpheed.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
Every freaking game, yeah.

14:27.000 --> 14:30.000
Silpheed, Robo-Lest, Shattered Answer,

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
Strider, which is normally a game that I would just

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
dominate without even thinking about it.

14:34.000 --> 14:37.000
And tonight, or last night, every cheap death

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
I was like, son of a bitch!

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
Oh, terrible stuff.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
Didn't you beat Strider with your eyes closed once

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
or something crazy? What was it?

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
I've beaten Strider every which way.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
Seriously.

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
And last night, like I said, I continued three times,

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
didn't finish the game.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
I was just like, all right.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
That's plenty of that.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
For the record, it was two stages.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
Genesis does what I don't.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
For the record, it was two stages that I beat

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
with my eyes closed.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
I have no idea what you're talking about.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
When I was a kid, I could beat 8-1

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
on Super Mario Brothers with my eyes closed

15:12.000 --> 15:15.000
because I had the level timed.

15:15.000 --> 15:19.000
I could get through 8-1 without stopping,

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
but I couldn't do it with my eyes closed.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
But I could do it continuously running through the whole thing.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
I couldn't do that anymore.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
I can still get through it running.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
I couldn't do it blindfolded anymore

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
because I don't remember the timing.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
All right.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
I want to know what crazy accomplishments

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
our chatters have accomplished in video games.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
Like, just weird shit.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
Like, you beat a game. Okay, great.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
Yeah, we all beat games.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
I want to know, like, you beat a game

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
while hanging upside down,

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
getting water shot at your face or something.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
I want to know what crazy video game accomplishments

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
you guys have done.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
That would be fun to know about.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
It was kind of nonexistent.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
I think I pretty much hit on everything I played this week.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
I had a really busy week,

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
so I didn't get a lot done,

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
and I really didn't get a lot done with the podcast,

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
so I apologize to that. I'll talk about that in a minute.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
But I didn't play a lot outside of Warcraft.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
I'll give you guys a Warcraft update

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
for those that care, all two of you.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
Shut up.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
Our guild is now in Icecrown Citadel

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
because remember, our guild is about six months

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
behind all the other guilds

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
because we didn't start raiding

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
about six weeks ago, probably, at this point.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
We're now in Icecrown Citadel.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
You were raiding, but it wasn't lairs.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
We're in Icecrown Citadel now,

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
and we took out the fourth boss, Sauerfang.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
And that's how far we are right now.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
Sauerfang.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
Oh, I was like, if it's Sauerfang?

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
That guy had to be like...

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
It's with you, it's not an O.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
But I was saying, if it was Sauer,

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
then I'd be like, okay, what's gonna be my

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
fear-instilling nickname?

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
Well, he got Bloodfang,

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
Evilfang, and this one's Darkfang.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
I guess I'll go with Sauer.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
Sauerfang.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
It's not like Sauerfang, it's Sauerfang.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
Sauerfang. That sounds like a dog.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
Sauerfang.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
So yeah, that was the ICC accomplishment.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
I am on number four, by the way.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
Number four.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
Removal program number four.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
The AVG is good.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
It's all the stuff that I should have put on here to begin with.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
So you know what the problem with this whole thing is?

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
I'm gonna have to fix your computer.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
I fixed your computer

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
when you had that stupid thing that kept popping up.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
You remember that one registry thing that would keep

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
replicating itself every time you deleted the

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
registry file unless you removed yourself

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
from the internet? No, because I really try not to

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
get that shit on my computer.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
Everybody got it. And I removed it off Dan's.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
I have no idea what you're talking about.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
I just had a video card explode on me once.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
That was really... I don't get a lot of spot...

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
Well, my WoW account got hacked

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
about... when was it? It was when I was in Disneyland

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
October, so it was about

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
almost a year ago now.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
Shut up.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
My WoW account got hacked.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
And I was like, how the hell

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
did that happen? Did somebody get my password?

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
What kind of keylogger got on my computer?

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
Who else has my password? And then I figured

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
it out. You know how I am pretty convinced

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
somebody got my Warcraft password?

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
Because I used to play on my ex's computer.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
And he was dumb enough to get all that spyware stuff.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
So that's how they got my password

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
because I made the mistake of playing on someone

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
else's computer and it doesn't know better.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
So, word of warning, everybody.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
I do think that I've already uninstalled

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
World of Warcraft from my computer.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
Even though I probably won't ever play it again,

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
I don't want them to get my account.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
Because they would have stole your World of Warcraft account.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
They would have stole all the gold

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
Rob gave me.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
Oh, while I'm ex-bashing here on the show,

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
can I tell you something else I realized?

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
Which one?

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
It actually has to do with gaming.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
You know which one. The one...

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
Oh!

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
There.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
Because I don't want to

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
do slanderous or anything.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
Here's the thing. I actually realized this today

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
while I was driving down and listening to another podcast.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
You know how I've been really afraid to play

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
Starcraft 2 because I think it's too hard.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
And I'm not really good at RTS games.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
I'm really worried that the game is not...

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
I'm not going to be able to do well at the game.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
Well, I realized that my ex

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
was a big Starcraft fan.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
His online name was actually based out of the

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
Starcraft universe and everything. And it really hit me.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
If that dumb fuck can play

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
Starcraft, I can play Starcraft!

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
So I'm going to go out and buy Starcraft 2 tomorrow.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
I'm Jim Brainer 1262,

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
hardcore Starcraft fan.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
Well,

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
you were still supposed to bring me something, Rob.

19:25.000 --> 19:29.000
Oh,

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
I haven't been home.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
I haven't been home.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
If you put it on the easiest setting, by the way,

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
Starcraft 2 is like, hyper easy.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
Is it really?

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
Like, die!

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
BlackWolf, our good pal who does the show before us

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
here at All Games Radio, which by the way, I don't remember

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
if I said this, but we do tape live every week at

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
www.allgames.com right after

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
Bobby BlackWolf's show.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
Bobby BlackWolf says casual mode

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
is reasonable, Rob.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
There you go. I guess that's cool.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
Oh yeah, in my gaming week. I got Starcraft 2 last week.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
How was it? You like it?

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
Can I play it? Am I smart enough to play it?

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
Yeah, that's what I said. It's not very hard.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
If you play it on casual.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
There's too many screenshots and stuff.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
I'm like, there's too many units on the screen.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
I can't handle this. It's too much.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
I'm just, I'm weird, you guys.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
Are you seeing this?

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
I don't play a lot of RTS.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
This thing is amazing. Yeah, Jamie got that out when you were gone last week.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
I was thumbing through it and I turned everything upside down and put it back.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
Sweet.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
Let's see.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
I was asking for gaming accomplishments

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
and I didn't see a lot, but I do see

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
SalaciousPop in our chat room

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
says, I got up to stage

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
5 and Battletoads on one set of lives once.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
Once. That's an accomplishment.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
That is an accomplishment. Also, oh wow.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
Also, I

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
beat the original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
NES game twice

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
with all four turtles alive.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
That's pretty hardcore.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
Yeah, that's pretty

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
tricky. That's a tough game.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
The technodrome was actually a really

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
difficult boss.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
Alright. Tigerclaw in chat

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
says, yeah, I play in casual mode, but the game is still

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
kicking my ass though. It's all about trial and error.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
If you fuck up, just restart. See, Tigerclaw

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
and I need to play co-op because it's

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
like the blind leading the blind. That would be awesome.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
Rage quit the team.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
Rage quit the team. Yes. Rage quit together.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
Alright.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
I have my first rage quit, Rob.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
Rage quit?

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
In Star Trek Online? Really?

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
Because my shit got blew up.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
And I was like, fuck this. Exit.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
I rage quit playing Genesis games last night.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
Alright.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
Ask Misty. Misty, I don't want to neglect you

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
and your gaming week. How was your gaming week?

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
Between work

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
and because of my

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
tendency to do a shift on two hours

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
of sleep and then crash after I get home.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
Basically non-existent. Had some

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
obligatory Rock Band 2 time.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
But

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
for some reason I... Don't forget to

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
talk in that mic, hon, or we can't hear you.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
But basically non-existent.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
Rock Band 2.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
Bought some stupid Rainbow Unicorn

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
game. I blame Rob.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
Rainbow Unicorn game is awesome.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
Robot Unicorn Attack on iPhone.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
What about the one where you get

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
ass, is it?

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
Pink anus. That's on Steam.

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
I have that game. I know you do.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
Really? Yes.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
There's a unicorn game and there's a...

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
How many times have I told the story on this show already?

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
There's a mineral or something that you use

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
to like, I don't know, perfect your unicorns.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
Polish their horns, we'll say.

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
That is...

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
Anus. A-E-N-U-S.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
So you collect pink anus

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
to polish their horns, basically.

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
I knew that, I just wanted to hear you say it.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
Okay.

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
Alright, anyway.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
Alright,

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
anything else for your gaming week, Misty?

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
Not really.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
And by the way, you took a flight

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
out here for the first time, right? When was your first time

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
flying? Yes it was. How was it?

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
Was it that bad?

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
Surprisingly,

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
the only time I was really that nervous was during

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
takeoff. Alright. And then once you got

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
in the air, you just took a Valium and everything was okay?

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
No, I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
No, I had drugs in case

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
I needed them, though.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
Just in case. Some standby.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
But no, it wasn't too bad.

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
Hell, by about the time

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
we got over the Grand Canyon, I was

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
even kind of getting to the point where I could look

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
out the window for more than half a second before

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
having to look away. Oh, but looking out the

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
window is great. Actually, I like going over lakes

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
and taking pictures of them.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
I like flying JetBlue or

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
Frontier or any airline that has the

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
television in the seat in front of me because

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
then I just, and I

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
literally did this once. I was on a flight to

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
New York, which is about five and a half hours from

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
SAC, or SF, and I watched

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
SpongeBob SquarePants the entire way.

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
It was the best flight I ever took. I didn't have to think

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
about the takeoff. I mean, yeah, it's

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
noisy, but otherwise it was like,

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
you know, SpongeBob SquarePants. Anyway.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
Oh, but you bet I whipped out my

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
iPod as soon as they announced that we had

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
reached cruising altitude. And even

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
then I didn't buy the book I bought through the

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
Kindle app. Isn't that

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
funny? You'll bring all this shit and you're like, yeah, I'm gonna

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
watch a movie on the plane. I'm gonna play this game.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
And then, like, you just fall asleep.

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
At least that's what I do. Well,

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
there's more attention span for me, but that

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
is part of the reason I made it a point not

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
to pack any physical books, just my

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
iPod and a notebook

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
for writing out my ghetto blog

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
mainly. I really like having my netbook

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
because it's, um, since I have, like, an

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
eight-hour battery on it,

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
I can just watch movies

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
and Doctor Who and stuff

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
the entire time. I'll tell you

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
what I still do on planes, and this

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
is old school. This is what, back in my

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
day, before we had a Game Boy,

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
this is what we did, okay?

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
And still, to this day, I

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
like to do this, is that, you know those

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
variety games books? They're like the

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
Penny Press variety crossword

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
puzzles and games? Like, they have the crosswords

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
and the anagram puzzles

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
and, you know, the logic puzzles and

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
all those. Surely someone in chat knows

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
what I'm talking about. I will buy, like, one

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
of those books at the, um,

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
you know, they always have, like, a newsstand, and that will

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
actually entertain me for a good couple hours on the flight

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
because those logic problems are hard, you guys.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
The heck with the chatroom. I actually have

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
one somewhere in my room that my mom gave me before

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
ASEN that I was gonna do

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
on the train up to Chicago,

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
and I either lost

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
it or I just didn't do it. All I know

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
is it's sitting in my room undone still.

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
Let's be honest.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
You wanna have fun on a plane, train, bus, whatever?

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
Mad Libs.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
Mad Libs are great.

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
Mad Libs rule. Especially if you're like

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
loud Mad Libs. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
If, like, you guys are all sitting a bunch of seats apart

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
and it's all your co-workers

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
or your friends, and everyone

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
on the plane is really, really annoyed

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
with you guys already, start doing

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
some Mad Libs. Oh my God.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
It's the most fun you could possibly have.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
But, Dan, keep in mind that

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
when I do travel, it's

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
usually alone, and I'm

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
unless I'm like with

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
you, Rob and Jamie, I'm not particularly

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
social on my

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
method of travel. Do Mad Libs with the people

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
next to you. Or do Mad Libs by yourself.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
Just be like

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
You can do Mad Libs by yourself.

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
Just turn to the person next to you,

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
scary hobo, psycho killer,

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
housewife, whatever, and be like, hey,

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
you wanna throw down some Mad Libs?

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
If they say no, sit next to someone else.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
Excuse me, ma'am. Excuse me, excuse me, ma'am.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
Ma'am. Ma'am. Ma'am.

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
Ma'am. I need

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
an adjective.

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
Can I get an adverb?

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
Can I get a proper noun?

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
Hit the call button on the flight.

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
How can I help you today?

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
Excuse me, attendant? Yes, I need a noun.

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
I need

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
an adjective that ends in

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
Lee. And the good point is

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
and the good thing is you probably will see

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
any of those fuckers ever again.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
I

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
need a transitive verb.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
Or you can just use whatever words that they give you.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
You don't have to worry about whether they give you

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
the right word or not. Hey, hey,

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
give me a word. F off. There you go. Perfect.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
Those are gonna be some awesome

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
Mad Libs.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
I

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
don't know what that has to do with games, but who cares.

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
Alright, housekeeping tonight.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
Mad Libs is kind of a game.

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
Mad Libs are the best of

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
Do they have like a mad

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
They should have Mad Libs on Xbox Live.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
I was just thinking Xbox Live Arcade

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
Mad Libs. Now that

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
1 versus 100 is gone,

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
it should be replaced by

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
Xbox Live Mad Libs.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
And the funnier you can make them, the more points you get.

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
Hosted by Dan. Yeah.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
I would be better than the guy who did 1 versus 100.

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
That's the most fun you can have with your clothes on.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
Send in your adverb right now.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
Do it. Do it.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
Do it. You remember one time

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
back early in the show, I tried to do a

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
Mad Lib. Mad Libs for us.

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
I think I do remember.

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
SSJ 100 Matt has a good point.

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
He says, I totally want to sit between

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
Dan and Rob on a plane.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
I don't blame you, Matt.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
That would be awkward.

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
We should do 1 versus, or not 1 versus.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
We should do Orange Land Radio Mad Libs.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
You know, I was thinking the

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
same thing, but it was brought to my attention

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
that Understation Live has a segment called

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
USL Mad Libs. And if we star

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
our Mad Libs, I'm going to get a nasty

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
voicemail from Travis. Okay. Sorry, Travis.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
We're doing them. Yeah.

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
One of these weeks. Ah, screw that.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
Maybe even tonight

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
if I can find a book, we are doing Mad Libs.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
Alright, alright, fine.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
Go find a Mad Lib book, and we will

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
do Mad Libs in Part B. Don't even think

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
we don't have one. I know you got one somewhere.

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
Jamie, you must find our Mad Libs

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
book. Alright. You know, I found them the other day.

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
So hurry up and go to Kmart and get a new one or something.

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
We could do Chat Room Mad Libs.

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
Let them suggest. Right, exactly.

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
It's the show where every gamer

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
gives a noun. Everybody

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
gets their word

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
in Mad Libs.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
Alright.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
I think our chat room is really enjoying

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
having you on the show already. Without

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
Dan, there would not be Mad Libs. It's what we do.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
Right. Housekeeping.

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
Tonight, first

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
my opponent. I deleted it!

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
Wait, that fucker.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
I found that shit

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
and I owned it.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
Awesome. Thank you, folks.

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
Good night.

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
Hey, where's my OS?

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
MT Recycle Bin. Hell to the yes.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
Everyone, go on your computer and look for

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
MS008E

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
underscore 247 dot exe and delete

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
that shit for me, please. Her computer is gonna be like

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
I can't do that, Jamie.

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
Housekeeping, I wanted to apologize

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
that the last podcast is still not up on the

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
feed. It'll go up tonight. If I don't

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
do it Sunday or Monday, then I don't get around

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
to doing it at all. But you'll get two shows

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
on the feed this week. And here's the other

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
thing, guys, and I know it's gonna be really

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
sad, but we have to say it. There's

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
not going to be a show next week.

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
I'm sorry, but no-

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
Because of Rob. Well, I'd like

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
to think Loki's also partially to blame.

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
But I'm gonna be out of town

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
next weekend, so I will not be here.

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
Obviously, Matt is still on baby

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
leave. And Jamie, well,

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
she'll probably infect her computer or something else.

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
So she'll need to- I could just do it

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
myself. Just three hours

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
of Dan. Dan radio.

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
We hate him so

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
much. There's a button that you push.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
All you do is wait for Bobby to say

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
push the button, and then

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
you push the button and you're live.

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
Radio is so fucking

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
easy. Especially shoutcast.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
Hell, I even did the shoutcast

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
station for a little bit, took part in one.

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
It would be cool if I could pump up the volume again.

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
I won't be here. That would win.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
Maybe we'll try to pre-tape

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
this week or something. Maybe.

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
I don't want to promise that. Rob. Rob. Rob. Rob.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
What? What is one of my

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
major pet peeves using unnecessary

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
prefixes?

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
I have no idea what she's talking

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
about. You don't pre-tape,

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
you just tape. Don't you listen to George

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
Carlin?

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
Shut up.

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
Hey, I like having Dan on

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
the show.

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
No,

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
the moment that he says that, I start thinking of ways to

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
kill him, so. Alright.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
And I start praying for death.

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
I think I'm done apologizing.

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
Facebook.com slash OrangeLivesRadio

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
join our Facebook. He hit me in the booby.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
Hey, just so you know, it wasn't like

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
violence. I threw a gachamon at her.

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
I'll take a picture of it.

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
Sweet.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
Do we even want to do gaming news tonight,

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
or should I just let the two of them go at it for three hours?

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
Welcome to our delightful marriage.

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
Doesn't Madden come out next week?

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
Doesn't Madden come out next week? I don't know.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
Fuck Madden.

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
Yes, I will agree with that totally.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
Here's the tragedy, okay?

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
If you talked to me a couple months ago,

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
and I still had a job, I would know

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
when Madden's coming out, because it would be like

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
my whole life. I'd be like,

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
oh man, I gotta get ready for Madden launch.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
Oh man, how many Madden pre-orders do I have?

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
Now that it's not my whole life, I'm just

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
like, hey, isn't

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
that football game coming out?

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
Jesus, who cares?

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
Yeah, World Cup 94.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
No, not football.

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
Football!

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
I thought

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
I saw some email about Madden

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
Midnight Madness. Oh look,

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
this page I'm on, look, the whole time

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
there's been this giant ad sitting there on the page

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
I'm on. Midnight launch at

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
Walmart, August 10th, so yes,

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
Madden's out tomorrow.

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
I'm awesome at this.

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
My favorite part is that the whole time

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
we were saying, I don't know, I don't know, it's sitting right

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
there on the screen.

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
But it's Madden, it won't matter, so it does not

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
matter. My screen has the Sega Genesis on it.

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
I can't do it.

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
Alright.

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
I regret nothing.

32:31.000 --> 32:35.000
I would like, I wish

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
I wish I had more time to be an idiot.

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
It makes it so I know I don't want to fuck

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
Madden, I want Madden to go off and get

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
fucked.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
Preferably in a big

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
flamey death. Here's the thing, I would love

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
to go out to the midnight launches

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
and do something for the

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
Madden launch.

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
That can happen before the fire happens.

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
No, because look, I have friends that play

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
Madden. You know what?

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
I was going to say, you've got to watch out for it, because

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
honestly enough, I've done many

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
many midnight launches. I've done halos,

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
I've done Grand Theft Autos, which are

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
by far the scariest.

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
Especially San Andreas, because our games

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
would have laid like five hours.

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
But Madden's are the one

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
midnight launch where dudes throw down and get into fights.

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
Wow.

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
Because you've got these people in line, and you know that they're the

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
obsessives because they get in line at like noon.

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
It's like, dude, we've got 700

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
copies. We're not running out.

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
The guy's like, oh, I've got to get my Madden.

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
Gotta get that Madden. Got that Madden!

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
So people are waiting for Madden.

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
Fuck your Madden prick.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
Then they start having this argument about like,

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
oh man, the Raiders, this team, oh no,

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
this team, that team, and they're like about to throw

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
down. And I'm like, guys, guys, look, football.

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
And then they like run out in the parking lot

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
and start throwing around the football. It worked really

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
well. Because I thought they were going to

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
kill each other.

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
Here's the thing, though. If I make fun of

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
people that stand in line for Madden,

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
then I play World of Warcraft

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
and Dance Dance Revolution

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
for heaven's sakes. Like, you know,

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
it's, you can't like be

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
a Trekkie and then look at the guy obsessed with Star Wars

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
and call him a nerd, you know what I mean?

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
Sure you can.

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
It's called having a double standard.

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
It happens all the time!

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
It happens all the time!

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
I feel like as a responsible

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
gaming journalist,

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
That was funny.

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
I feel like

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
as the, I shouldn't,

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
you know, I'm not saying

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
make fun of people.

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
You know, it's just that you're supposed to make fun

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
of people different from you. Which is, in your case,

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
everybody. So,

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
you know, you just gotta get

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
on it. I remember we were waiting for the Dreamcast,

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
right? Were you there for, no you weren't there for, that was

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
kind of before... That was before I knew you kids.

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
That was for the whole Rob time. That's right.

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
We were waiting in line for Dreamcast,

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
and people were driving by and they were

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
making fun of us and we were just making fun of them back.

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
But it was Dreamcast, not fucking Madden.

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
What are you waiting for? We're like,

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
Pokemon cards!

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
What are you guys waiting for?

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
Beanie Babies!

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
And then this reporter showed up and started covering us

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
for the news, and we heckled her so

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
mercilessly that she ran off crying.

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
Midnight launch lines rule.

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
You've gotta do it.

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
We did the Wii thing, remember?

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
We did the donuts and coffee for the Wii.

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
I don't remember that.

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
Yeah, you didn't go, you were asleep.

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
I was sleeping because I had to go to a store the next day

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
and sell the four Wiis that I had.

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
Still, Beanie Babies and Pokey News.

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
Kristen and I were waiting in line and we bribed them for our spot

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
at the front of the line.

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
Yeah, because you got to cut to the front because there was

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
a listener of Orange Lawn's radio.

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
Like the one listener in Sacramento

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
happened to be at the front of the line.

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
Whatever works.

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
That's a great story too because Jamie says,

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
Oh yeah, me and Kristen are gonna go wait in line for the Wii

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
if I can get one, can I buy one?

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
And I'm like, yeah, yeah, you go on and do that.

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
Be sure to pick me up a copy of Zelda.

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
So I wake up the next day to go sell Wiis

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
and I look on my couch, there's a Wii sitting with a copy of Zelda.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
I was like, son of a bitch.

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
How did she do that?

36:01.000 --> 36:05.000
It's called contacts.

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
I guess.

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
I wonder if that guy still listens.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
But as soon as Krispy Kreme opened,

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
Kris went out and got donuts.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
Krispy Kreme is 24 hours, darlin'.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
Not that one. It wasn't 24 hours.

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
If he does listen, thank you.

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
My wife spent $250 on a game console

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
that I've played like three times.

36:23.000 --> 36:27.000
We've played it more than that.

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
Are you gonna play the new Metroid when it comes out?

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
Probably.

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
Can you play the new Sonic when it comes out?

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
I play everything a little bit. I won't play it on the Wii.

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
Sonic!

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
Can we actually get into some gaming news now?

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
Let me see, how far into the show are we tonight?

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
No, what if I refuse?

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
Hey! Whoever is in the chat room is

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
OLR recruit, you got five minutes to change your

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
nickname or I kick you.

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
Damn.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
I know, you're on a power trip tonight.

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
What is up with this?

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
The program, Rob.

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
I've been fringing on her territory so

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
she has to be Alpha Jamie.

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
My E-peen

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
is so huge right now.

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
Nice.

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
So, gaming news.

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
I've got a ruler.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
Once in a while, shove it up your ass.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
Oh!

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
See, Rob? That's not appropriate.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
Now now, Rob.

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
Bad. Bad Rob.

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
Now, aw,

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
you made the OLR recruit cry

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
because he or she does not know how to

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
change their name and they're very sad.

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
What the hell was that?

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
Alright.

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
You are walking home.

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
Alright.

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
Can I, can I... I somehow doubt it.

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
Can I, hello, can I, can I

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
do the gaming news now? Hello?

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
Hi, hello? Hi. Gaming news, the hell is that?

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
Rob. Hello? It's news

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
about gaming.

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
We need a theme song for gaming news.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
Every other show on All Games has some theme song

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
when they go into gaming news. We do not have a theme song.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
The Benny Hill theme. I've got one for you, Rob.

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
Yakety Sax.

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
For this episode, I just might have to...

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
Here's Rob's theme song.

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
What?

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
No, I was supposed to be the one

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
to bust out that app randomly.

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
Stop it right now.

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
What in the flippity fuck was that?

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
My Mozilla app.

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
You are deleting that.

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
If you're listening,

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
I need you to be back here.

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
Like, I know you have a baby.

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
Please come back

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
as soon as possible. I'm trying to help you get in the news.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
I know you are. It's not my fault.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
Everything is your fault, Dan.

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
Now we replace Jamie.

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
Sweet.

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
Alright.

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
Then you can sit in her desk.

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
Dan, keep in mind,

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
I know where you sleep.

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
And there's a Dave & Buster letter

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
opener right here with kind of sharp edges.

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
Kind of.

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
Gaming news? No, gaming news.

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
Xbox Live Indie

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
Games.

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
Might not be getting Kinect.

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
Alright, here's the deal.

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
A lot of folks might be thinking,

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
hey, Kinect is coming out soon.

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
Xbox Live has this whole

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
indie games thing. Why can't we have Kinect

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
games on Xbox Live? Well, because they don't

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
want to let you do it.

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
Look, this is because of an interview based with

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
Digital Spy.

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
A Microsoft spokesperson actually said that, quote,

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
only developers with established

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
contacts and

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
contracts with Microsoft

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
are going to be able to make the Kinect games.

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
Only those that Microsoft actually

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
partnered with for the launch are able

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
to make the Kinect games.

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
They haven't said that you will never

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
be able to make a Kinect game if you

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
are a developer for XNA. It's going

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
to be considered for the future,

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
but nothing is actually being considered at this

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
time. So sorry there will be no

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
Baby Maker

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
2000 or whatever that game is called

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
Kinect enabled at launch.

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
It does seem to me to be the dumbest thing

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
they could possibly do. Why is that?

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
Well, if you

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
think about it, all the video game

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
companies are going to be trying to do the same thing

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
the same way.

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
They're going to try to make the Kinect work.

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
It's going to be some maniac out there

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
with some indie game idea who's

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
going to come up with the idea that makes

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
the Kinect the must-have

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
object that people

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
will pay $150 for.

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
Because the thing is already $60

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
overpriced.

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
They're killing it. They're just

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
killing it.

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
It's killing its chances of becoming

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
the next big thing. Dan, I got to admit

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
Dance Central is pretty awesome.

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
You know you want to play Dance Central.

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
Dan, are you going to dance to Poker Face?

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
Probably not.

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
I'm not saying the Kinect is not a great idea.

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
I believe

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
in the Kinect. I believe in the

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
demonstrations I've seen. I think the

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
technology is amazing. I'm glad

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
to see that somebody is getting on it.

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
And that it's not Sony's

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
pathetic, we-controller

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
rip-off. But at the same

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
time, I just think from a

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
retailer's perspective, they're

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
charging too much for it.

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
And I just don't see it

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
doing anything different

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
yet. I mean, if something comes out

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
with the interactivity of

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
the Milo program

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
and

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
a great game is built

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
around it, and you can

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
stand around and

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
play that game,

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
it'll sell some Kinects, sure.

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
But you need something like

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
the Wii Bowling thing that got

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
everyone to believe in the Wii.

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
The thing on the Wii was, oh wow, that's kind of cool.

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
Wii Bowling's amazing! It's like bowling

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
in real life! And the Kinect doesn't

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
have that program.

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
Because you're not going to mainstream

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
people with Dance Central.

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
Even though it's by Harmonix and it's a great game

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
for Rob.

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
For me.

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
Well, because to you,

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
that's the kind of thing that you're into.

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
That's the kind of thing that you love. For me,

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
I was never really into the music rhythm games

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
except for Guitar Hero

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
and Guitar Freaks and whatnot.

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
Well, of course you're going to want it to.

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
That way you have to spend the money on it.

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
Maybe there will be a Red Dead Redemption Part 2

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
where you can actually choke a bitch.

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
Sure! Exactly!

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
Where I can lasso

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
everyone in town by waving my arm

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
and, wait, that didn't look so good.

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
That looks like I'm playing Dance Party there.

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
Or Dance Central.

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
But yeah, they just need to come up with

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
the right program, and I think that telling the indie

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
developers, yeah, you guys are out

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
on this is a big mistake.

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
If Choke-a-Bitch mode happened

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
in the next Red Dead Redemption,

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
I might even have to invest in that.

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
Screw Choke-a-Bitch mode. Someone just needs

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
to release a game called Choke-a-Bitch.

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
Even better.

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
Could you do that lasso motion one more time in Studio

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
Dam for us? Let's do the

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
lasso motion one more time.

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
Oh, darn it.

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
I screwed on the thing I was trying to do.

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
I was going to get Dan some music to do his

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
lassoing, too.

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
That's a poker face.

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
Come on, Dan.

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
Is it on YouTube?

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
Swing that hand, Dan.

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
That's classy.

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
Everything is on YouTube.

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
You know what? I like the piano version of that song.

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
I like the Cartman version.

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
I don't even know how I got into

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
Just Dance. There's a Cartman version? Why am I not

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
surprised? Other comments from our chatroom

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
at chat.orangelaunchradio.com

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
Let's see. Sj100matt

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
says that our good buddy and indie developer

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
YYR is pissed about this.

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
He was going to make Killer

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
Wheelchair Golden Girls game using

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
Kinect. See, that's what

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
Microsoft's afraid of.

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
Is that if they let the indie developers make

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
it, somebody's going to make the Golden Girls

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
game featuring Kinect, and then

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
that's going to be the must-have game.

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
Not dancing.

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
They still have ultimate control over what

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
release is.

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
Right?

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
Yes, but

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
if it's objectionable,

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
reject it.

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
XNA is a little different, because it's all

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
community-based, and

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
Microsoft, per se, I mean, yes,

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
they have ultimate control over it, but

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
they don't really babysit it. It's all

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
community-driven. It's like, what's the difference

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
being controlled by your controller and controlled

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
by Kinect? I think

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
it's probably a technical

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
problem. You know, I think that

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
the Kinect is not working out as well as I thought it

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
was already, and so now they're like,

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
oh, no, we just won't let the indie guys on it,

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
and, you know, we can

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
give the developers specific instructions

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
how to make the thing work.

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
They don't want to show all their cards,

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
basically. Maybe.

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
Anyhow, let's move on with more gaming news.

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
Dark Sakura, surely you have something you want to share with us tonight.

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
Well, it's about the move.

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
The move.

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
Hahahaha, Sony.

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
Well, they

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
are not going to have just a kiosk

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
for showing that they've actually

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
given me reps, Sony is,

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
to teach people how to use the move

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
in person. Ooh.

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
Is it that complex? Is it that

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
big of a deal? Yeah, and the

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
reps are all training on Nintendo Wiis.

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
But they are going

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
to be

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
giving seven hours of

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
move training to

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
people who already have a base knowledge

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
of Sony consoles.

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
And the competition.

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
Ooh.

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
Speaking of, um, stupid,

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
they're actually coming out.

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
What?

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
I don't...

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
And speaking of, um, stupid,

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
that was funny, so don't stop.

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
Okay, anyway, speaking of stupid, um,

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
there's actually accessories that are going to be

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
out with the move, like gloves.

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
Yes, they are

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
gloves.

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
And you can secure the move

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
thing to the glove

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
so that you don't drop it.

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
What else can you

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
secure to the glove? Probably a

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
cog.

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
Okay. It is kind of, well,

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
the move is kind of wide

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
like a good dildo, so maybe you could put a vibrator

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
in there.

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
Kay.

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
That's my wife, ladies and gentlemen!

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
No.

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
I'm just saying, I'm using my

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
imagination. You said what else could go in there that would be

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
useful. Joe Digitech in our chatroom is calling

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
him Love Gloves.

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
Cucumbers, Rob!

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
What if you're really, really

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
hungry, okay, get this, what if you're

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
really, really hungry and you're playing your move

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
and you don't really want to

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
have to let go of your cucumber to

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
play? Will it be cross

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
compatible with Nintendo Wii accessories?

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
Is it a bumpy cucumber? I bet you can use it

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
with a Wiimote!

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
Classic!

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
But yeah, stupid.

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
You guys could use them on your microphones.

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
That's true, we can use them on our microphones

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
but we don't drop them because we're too...

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
I guess maybe we don't have the

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
fine motor control or brain power

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
to understand. Open hand,

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
insert object, close hand.

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
Hold tightly!

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
Maybe? I think if you're going to release an accessory

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
that's so complex that you need to

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
train people to train people

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
for you to pay people to train

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
people how to use it. For seven hours

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
of training? Okay, but to be fair, to be fair,

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
fair Dan, let's be fair.

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
We're fair. A couple weeks ago on the show

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
we talked about Kinect doing demos

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
at Macy's.

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
So they are also sending

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
people out to teach them how to use Kinect

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
which really involves just

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
flailing. There isn't even

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
a controller to use. No gloves,

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
no cucumbers,

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
just you.

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
And your cucumber.

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
They didn't train anyone how to use iToy.

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
Well, we

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
saw how that went. Exactly. All they needed

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
to do was get the window washing game out there at

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
Macy's and it was sold like crazy.

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
That little game where you were like the ninja and you were like

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
standing on the screen and hitting all the little ninjas.

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
That was pretty fun.

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
So now, I guess it is, now people decide to

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
abuse Kinect. They can say

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
well we have people out there teaching them how to use it

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
right. It's not our

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
fault. We showed them how to do it. Well

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
companies do believe that all their users

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
are devastatingly stupid.

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
When my bank got new ATMs, they had a

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
couple days where people would stand outside and

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
teach you how to use the ATM. Nice.

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
They were called the ATM

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
ambassadors.

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
Did you have to use them? Because I'd be like

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
if they were like, do you need

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
help using the ATM? I'd be like, get the fuck out of here.

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
I don't want you seeing my pin. Unfortunately,

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
I wasn't using the ATM. I was taking my deposit

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
to the bank when I was working at the store.

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
Did you know that the new ATMs will actually

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
take your deposits? We would make fun of the ATM

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
ambassador every morning.

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
I don't think he liked me very much.

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
Yeah, but it was a job.

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
Pointing at him and laughing.

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
It was a job.

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
Our chat room is suggesting that as far as these gloves go,

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
you can get a glittery one for the new Michael

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
Jackson game.

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
Dot, dot, dot.

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
They're padded.

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
Is it just so that you don't

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
accidentally punch yourself in the face for something to do?

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
I'm gonna put

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
the picture of this in the chat room.

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
The new move helmet.

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
Don't

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
forget about the crayons that come as a pack

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
and snack.

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
Because

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
if you're playing games with the woo, the move,

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
you obviously need a helmet. The woo?

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
The woo. The woo?

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
I would like to see a console

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
named the woo. We have the wee and the woo.

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
There should be a console named the woos.

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
The woos? Like the maze.

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
Do you remember? Tangent time.

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
Actually, this is a reflow. We need the

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
little dream sequence.

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
Well, you got control. Make it happen.

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
I don't have every sound

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
ever known a man. You're killing me with this.

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
Look, look, look.

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
Back in the day, Nintendo Power

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
like sixth or seventh

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
issue, they actually profiled

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
a real life video game

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
that existed in Vacaville, California.

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
It was called the woos. Yeah.

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
And it was the maze. And that's what Dan's

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
referring to. That was a Nintendo Power, huh?

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
The Nintendo Power was awesome.

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
Twenty years ago, yes.

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
Oh yeah. Or whenever it started.

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
Back when Nintendo Power started, it was amazing.

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
And then GamePro came out

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
and we all made fun of it because it wasn't as good as Nintendo Power.

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
The woos Vacaville.

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
I was on like Team GamePro

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
or whatever it was called. There's a website up.

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
Yeah, it was like you had to write an essay

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
and they picked 250 people to be in their little club

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
and do you know what we did once we were in the club?

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
Nothing.

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
Yeah. So it's like I won

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
I don't even remember what I wrote my essay on

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
but yeah, it was a long time ago.

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
But sadly the woos is long gone.

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
They bulldozed the woos. Way gone.

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
I posted a link.

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
Is it a car dealership or an outlet mall?

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
Oh, that might be where they built the outlets.

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
I'm pretty sure that's where they built the outlets.

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
Oh, how sad.

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
So every time I go to the big

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
Calvin Klein outlet store

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
that was once...

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
That's what you do is you walk up and down the aisle

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
and the sales people are finally like, what are you doing?

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
I can't find my way out.

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
Okay, this is kind of funny.

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
I found a blog about it with an aerial view.

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
It probably was the same aerial view

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
that was in Nintendo Power years ago.

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
They would actually change the configuration.

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
I love how this starts. Back in the late 80s

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
things sucked. The music sucked.

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
The movie sucked. The entertainment slash things

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
that you do sucked. What the fuck are they smoking?

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
Back in the late 80s the movies rocked.

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
We had hella arcades then.

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
What a hell, author.

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
This person apparently is pooping on the woos.

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
It was born in 1991

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
so kiss my ass.

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
Alright, what's next?

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
Princess Bride did not suck.

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
Thank you.

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
Mystique came in and said,

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
hey, hey.

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
I don't even know what you're talking about.

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
Because the Princess Bride was like 87, 88.

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
Right.

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
And this guy says that there were no good movies in the late 80s

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
and therefore Mystique has just

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
made a logic

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
she's done a logic thing.

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
Wow, anything can happen once.

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
It's inconceivable.

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
I do not think that word

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
means what you think it means.

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
My head hurts.

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
Let's talk about

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
NBA Elite 11.

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
It comes with NBA Jam.

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
Thank you, Dan. That's what I was going to report.

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
That's a scam. It's a scam

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
because I have no interest in NBA

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
Elite 11 but I want NBA Jam

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
with a burning, fiery passion.

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
And I don't want to pay 60 bucks for it.

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
It's a fake.

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
What?

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
So just pretend you didn't hear that and I'm going to report

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
this news you've never heard before.

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
NBA Elite 11

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
will have a one-time download code

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
that will let you access

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
three modes of NBA Jam, Play Now,

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
Classic Campaign, and online.

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
This would explain why we saw ESRB ratings

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
last week.

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
They are not selling these separately, at least

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
for now. My gut tells me

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
where there's money to be made.

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
This is how it's going to work for like two months

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
or three months and then it'll be out for everybody.

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
Well sure, it's EA and EA is all

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
about the money but oh man.

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
For people like me who are idiots

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
who have been dying for NBA Jam

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
either I got to pay 50 bucks to get it

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
on the Wii or I got to pay 60

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
bucks to get it on the 360 rather

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
than paying the 15 bucks which I would be totally

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
willing to pay to get it on the 360.

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
Because

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
I love NBA Jam. I don't like

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
sports games but I love

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
NBA Jam.

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
I am in

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
your court.

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
I made a basketball joke.

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
That was awesome.

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
I hate you so much.

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
I don't like a lot of sports

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
games either but I love NBA

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
Jam, Double Dribble,

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
Blades of Steel. Oh, Blades of Steel

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
is sweet. It's like the best game

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
Konami ever made. I like the fact that you can play

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
Gradius at halftime. I know, right?

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
That's what everybody loves.

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
So sports games

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
aren't always like

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
missable for me. Like there's some

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
that you have to have. And I'm kind of in the same court

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
as you. They have to put the fun in. If they're

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
fun, you will play

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
them. How can I not

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
want NBA Jam on the 360

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
or even the PS3 because

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
360 means Xbox Live means I

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
can Boom Shakalaka

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
with my friends.

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
Right. That sounded dirty, Rob.

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
You could be like, puts it up.

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
Sweet touch.

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
Aw, NBA Jam is so cool.

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
I miss the old machines

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
where if you put in the right date you can play as

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
Mortal Kombat characters.

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
And Bill Clinton. That was the first

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
revision of NBA Jam Tournament

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
Edition. Hold on, though.

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
The way of looking at it that you just

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
said, Dan, is that I can pay $50

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
to have it on the Wii or I

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
could just wait and pay $15

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
for it on the Xbox 360. But that's assuming

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
it would be $15. What if

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
EA knows they have a premium

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
game here? What if you were looking at it

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
as I'm paying $60 for NBA

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
Jam and getting some other basketball game

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
for free? That's pretty graphics. Right. If it

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
was a full release, because the thing is I'll

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
never play NBA Elite 11.

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
I just never will. Not even once? Probably not.

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
Okay. Because I've

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
played NBA Live. I've

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
played NBA 2K. You know, and

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
honestly, in

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
this race, my

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
horse is definitely 2K.

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
It's just better. I mean, I

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
understand everyone out there. Oh, NBA

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
EA Sports, whatever. NBA

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
Live has just been atrocious

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
since like 2005.

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
But NBA Jam is awesome. Hence why it's

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
now NBA Elite. Exactly.

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
They finally said, okay, we're tired of getting our asses

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
kicked by 2K. We're going to change the

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
name. We're going to change the game. And then 2K is like,

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
Jordan, motherfuckers!

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
And then Elite was like, screw!

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
This sucks!

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
We'll put NBA Jam with

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
it! And I'm just like, oh, touche.

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
Touche EA. Very well

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
played. A2 EA?

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
Yeah, whatever. Yeah, I

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
want NBA Jam bad.

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
Tigerclaw in our chatroom

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
says, think about it. If NBA Jam had

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
online, we can try to represent the OL Army

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
in the big battles sometime in the future.

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
I completely forgot to mention Big Battle

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
during housekeeping because I got derailed. Something about

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
Mad Libs, but something

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
that the listeners have been asking

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
for forever is coming to the

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
Big Battle. A music game.

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
That's right. Guitar Hero 5 is now in the Big Battle.

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
So check it out. TheBigBattle.net

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
There you go. And if OLR

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
doesn't win the music game competition,

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
I don't, like,

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
like, really? Really?

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
I will disown all of you. No, I'm kidding.

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
I think my solution is if somebody

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
is buying NBA Elite and doesn't

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
care about NBA Jam, I will

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
buy their download code from them.

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
You're not gonna find that person.

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
You're killing me with this, Rob.

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
Well, I'm not gonna

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
buy it all special and shit.

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
See, I'm looking at it this

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
way. What if instead of looking

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
at it as I'm buying this game

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
and getting ripped off with this game

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
I don't even want, what if, okay, NBA

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
Jam on the Wii cost me

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
$50, I could pay

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
$10 more to get it on the 360,

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
which is, you know, pretty much what

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
most premium usually is.

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
You have to look at it the other way around.

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
I mean, sure, I want

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
it to come out for $15, too, but

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
you know, think about how the Wii

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
folks would be in an uproar if it was like, well,

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
it's $15 there but you're gonna charge me $50?

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
F you.

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
The Wii version gets extra modes.

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
I guess that's true, they do have extra modes.

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
They get like the classic Super

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
Star Tour and stuff, which I could care

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
less about. Alright.

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
Alright, let's, uh,

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
let's move on for more news. Can I just completely

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
get away from sports, please? Yes, you may.

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
Let's take a deep

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
breath of air.

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
If we were talking about

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
rugby or cricket... NBA

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
DJ Max

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
portable 3

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
has, um,

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
some, uh, new features.

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
It's, uh, and keep in mind this is

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
not a game that I have really played much

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
if any of, but they have

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
a, um, 3-track remixing

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
system that's made just for that

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
particular version. Um,

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
and, uh,

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
it, I was watching the video

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
of it while you were going off on,

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
um, NBA, whatever.

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
And, um,

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
but they're saying that, um,

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
that it's supposed to actually

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
be a completely revamped system.

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
It looks kinda neat.

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
Did they put a mode in the game that will

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
make it fun? I'm kidding,

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
I'm kidding, DJ Max is fine. DJ Max is,

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
it's BeatMania 2DX with buttons on your PS3

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
and it's fine, I'm just giving it a hard time.

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
I just wanted, like, some of the DJ Max

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
fans to sit there and

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
make this. The music is actually sounding

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
kinda cool. The music's neat.

58:21.000 --> 58:25.000
This is a great radio, we're just sitting here.

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
I don't know what that is, but that gave me

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
a headache.

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
Ah, creepy girl with no eyes.

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
Alright.

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
I don't know, uh, I'm glad they're putting in some new

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
modes and some new ideas so it doesn't just

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
feel like a 2DX port. It's kinda cool.

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
And, you know, to be fair, they have had

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
some other stuff, like, they do, like, like a

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
3-button mode, a 6-button mode, a

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
11 billion button mode. They do

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
all these different, like, modes and tricks

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
with it. Somebody else's PSP mode,

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
somebody's Wii mode.

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
I would like to see 2DX on the

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
PSP. I would like to see 2DX

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
on the PS3. With the Konami-style

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
2DX PSP controller.

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
Like, where is my PlayStation

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
3 version, like, of 2DX?

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
Why has that not come out yet?

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
I thought 2DX was over.

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
No, it's still going in the arcades in Japan.

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
Oh, I thought that they actually did a final version.

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
They did a final BeatMania.

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
They did BeatMania 1

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
and they did BeatMania 3 final,

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
but they never did a BeatMania 2 Deluxe final.

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
Interesting. That's still going.

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
They're on, like, what...

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
98th style, U6. I don't know, they're on, like,

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
18th or 19th style. They're a lot.

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
Nice. Because it proved popular

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
and has longevity.

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
It's a neat game. It's because that arcade machine

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
is amazing. The next one's gonna be

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
with remix mode or some shit in it.

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
It's so good.

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
Well, if you like these DJ games, maybe

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
DJ Hero 2 is something you're interested in.

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
I know I am, actually. The first DJ Hero game

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
was really underrated. Why are you laughing at me?

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
Oh, you told me I was gonna jump in and say,

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
but probably not.

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
No, DJ Hero 2 is gonna

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
have, of course, the multiplayer mode. And DJ Hero

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
1 had that too, but one thing that was missing when

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
you would play online is rewind.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
That's right. Now you can

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
rewind in multiplayer mode.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
You couldn't do that before, but now you're actually

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
gonna get to rewind. So once you get enough power

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
in the multiplayer mode, you're gonna be able to spin

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
the thing backwards and you rewind the track

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
and get more points. So in DJ Hero 2,

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
this will be in there. And what

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
happens is that while you rewind, your opponent

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
gets to do nothing while you

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
rack up the points.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
So that'll be kinda fun.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Yeah, that's gonna get pretty ugly.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
I'm just looking forward to

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
the rapping in it and how that'll play out online.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
Actually, Dan, I would love to do

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
some DJ Hero where I will do the DJ and you do

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
the rapping. Wouldn't that be fun?

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
You know what we need?

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
I would throw down. We need Dan

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
playing Def Jam Rap Star.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
Is this out yet?

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
I think it's coming out soon.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
I heard about that and that sounds amazing.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
Here's the thing, you guys.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
I know not everybody is into rap music.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
I can

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
give or take it, depending on who the artist is.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
But the music game that they're doing

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
actually looks really good.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
They had Def

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
Jam Rap Star sitting next to

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
Glee Karaoke Revolution.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
And I will tell you what,

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
Def Jam Rap Star

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
popped a cap in Glee's ass so

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
fast it's not even funny because the Glee game

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
was terrible. It's terrible.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
Well, first of all, anything that Konami

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
I mean, I hate to say this because I have

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
great love for Konami. But anything that Konami

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
does these days is pretty bad.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
Dance Masters looks

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
interesting. It's the first really

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
really interesting music game I've seen from them in a while.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
Who knows? But the budget's gone.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
Konami is not into

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
gaming like they were. There's just not

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
a lot of...

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
Well, they closed one of their

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
offices that was a huge part of it.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
They closed a lot of it. I mean, a lot of Konami

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
is just history. All the good talent is

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
gone.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
They're basically outsourcing

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
their franchises to make some money, but

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
yeah, anything that Konami

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
does is

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
pretty cut rate these days.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
Not to get off topic, but what do you think of that

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
Castlevania game that's coming out? The Castlevania

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
God of War thing?

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Hopefully going to be okay?

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
I mean, Castlevania

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
in 3D is pretty miss and miss.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
Not that

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
Lament of Innocence

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
and Curse of Darkness was the

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
other one. Those weren't the worst

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
3D action games to ever happen, but

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
they weren't the quality of what you'd

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
consider Castlevania. The new one

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
looks really good.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
They say they got Kojima on it

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
and Kojima's kind of

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
Konami's only superstar that's

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
really left, so

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
if it's awesome, great.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
I just don't know

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
I just don't have a lot of

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
you know, hope for

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
3D Castlevania. If I play it and I like it

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
I'm going to be pleasantly surprised. If you like

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
God of War, I think you'll like it. It's very pretty.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
It's much sexier than

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
the other 3D games. Of course it's on a different

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
console too. It looks great. But I totally

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
get what you're saying because Symphony of the Night was easily

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
easily one of the top 10 video games

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
ever made. Symphony of the Night is

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
there's almost no equal.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
I still like Run to a Blood better.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
And so it's kind of like every Castlevania game since then

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
it just hasn't compared.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
Yeah.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
Well, they're all building off of that formula

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
and you know, they're all

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
all the 2D ones are, you know

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
they're all portables and you know

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
they lose points for that.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Not that they're bad, but yeah.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
I really like Portrait of Ruin when I got through it.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
Portrait of Ruin was a great game.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
Let's see, SalaciousPop in our chatroom

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
says, Konami only seems to burp up new flavors

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
of Castlevania and Silent Hill. What was

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
their last really new IP?

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
Saw.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Hahahaha

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
Hahahaha

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
Okay. I'm actually trying to think.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
SHJ100 Matt

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
is still waiting on a new Zone of Enders game.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Everybody who came into the store and

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
saw there was a Saw game, everybody was like

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
there's a Saw game?

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
Is it any good?

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
I don't know. No one's ever played it.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
I've heard from people that can stomach

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
those kind of games that it's actually

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
not as bad as you'd think. And you know what? I did

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
I did play, well I watched

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
I watched Shane play the second

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
games demo at E3 and

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
it was interesting except for

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
all the gore. I just don't like

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
that stuff. But yet I love

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
Silent Hill. I can't explain it.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
Silent Hill isn't

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
well, it's a different kind of gore. It's more of a

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
decay. And I feel like

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
Saw is more like LOL gore.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
Like it's just like random. LOL gore.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
Here's how I put it.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
Look at the violence.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
Where Saw is

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
fresh, squirting, pulsating blood.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
Silent Hill is, it's been

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
dead for a while, but it's still twitching.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
Or the gore serves

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
as much as I hate to say this, a

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
plot point, as weird as that is.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
It's for scene, not for

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
shock. Check out his head, it's a pyramid.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
Yes.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
Dude, this guy's wearing a big metal triangle

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
on his head. Triangle man.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
Triangle man.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
How about another

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
piece of gaming news, Dark

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
Sakura? News? That's fantastic.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
This made me laugh my ass off, Rob.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
Nipponichi,

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
the company that made

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Disgaea, is doing a game called Criminal Girls

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
for PSP. And

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
it's like bad 70's

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
chicks in prison

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
is what it is.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
This sounds awesome.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
Was it directed by Quentin Tarantino?

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
Is Lizzie Lohan in it?

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
Aw man, Machete's gonna be great.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
No, but Lady Gaga is.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Sorry. Good enough.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
Oh, is it gonna be like the telephone music video

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
for real? Cause that's awesome.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
Can I create the cam story? No.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
Not tonight.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
Anyway, you play as

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
an all female prison warden

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
that's set in hell.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
And you have to rehabilitate

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
seven prisoners, and each of the

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
prisoners are like seven deadly sins.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
So you have gluttony, greed, lust,

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
you know.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
Is it home for infinite losers?

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
Misty comes in and asks, is it the home for

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
infinite losers? You don't have a microphone.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
That's what she keeps doing.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
If you're gonna say something, come in and grab the microphone.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
Just take Misty's when she's not looking.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
So you know how you have to rehabilitate

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
them, Rob? How?

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
With spankings and massages.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
I read about this. Cause here's the deal.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
Nipponichi had

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
to cancel like three projects.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
You okay?

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
Breathe, Dark Soccer,

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
breathe. You alright?

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
It's really not that funny. Nipponichi

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
had to cancel like three or four projects

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
and this is the one that they kept.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
I'm actually

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
getting scared a little bit, Dark Soccer, are you

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
okay? Only a little bit?

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
Spanking

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
and massages.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:47.000
Does it work

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
with the Kinect?

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
It's on the

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
PSP.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Does it work with the Kinect anyway?

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
Probably.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
I'm sure someone will find a way.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
I am...

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
So wait, let me

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
get this straight again. You are

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
in a prison

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
in hell and you

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
spank people to

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
massage them.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
Or massage them, right? Is that what I heard?

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
I think, ladies and gentlemen...

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
Video game of the year 2010.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
There's pictures. Let me find the picture.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
It was...

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
Oh my gosh.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
Was the secret word spank?

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
Did Pee Wee Herman

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
come out before the show?

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
It was in Dengeki

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
PlayStation magazine.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
You know, maybe I

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
missed the break during Bobby's show tonight.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
Did he come out and say, today's secret

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
word is spank.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
Oh, so that's why I missed it.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
If somebody says spank, scream real loud.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
Are you okay, Dark Soccer?

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
I'm going to put the link to the picture

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
in there of

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
what the characters

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
look like with their ginormous

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
boobies. And again, to listen live,

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, and

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
I know this makes for terrible radio, but I'm looking

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
at this. Of course, they have gigantic

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
tits.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
And they're like doing that whole blushing

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
thing. It looks like, see how like, okay,

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
notice this, like the top of their tits is

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
red. That's either like a really bad

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
sunburned tan. It's boob blush.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
Or they're getting spanked on their tits.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
Probably. Oh, even better, it's boob blush.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
I can tell you... Women actually

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
blush their boobies? I didn't know that.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
Boobs can blush. Have you ever blushed your

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
boobs? Not on purpose.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
This tells you how bad

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
off the Japanese gaming market is.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
Did Dan just have red stuff on his face

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
and he just went...

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
They're not very red right now. This is a

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
story about how bad the Japanese gaming

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
market is. That's red!

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
They're killing their important projects and they're

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
keeping this. They know who their

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
market is. Well, right, because that's the

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
people in Japan who are buying the games or the

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
psycho pervert otakus. Um, I'm

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
sorry, but this game sounds

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
awesome. And why are you

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
knocking it? Because we should be getting this game

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
as well. We won't, but we should.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
This is President Cat 2010

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
right here. I want this game.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
I still want President Cat! Damn it, me too.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
Why have you not

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
done this for me, husband?

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
I have no idea what you're talking about.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
President Cat! Your husband doesn't actually

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
listen to this show. He just likes to come on once in a while

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
and bring the lols. I

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
know about the existence of President

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
Cat, but I don't really know what she's

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
talking about.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
That's alright.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
Hey, let's get into what video games

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
are coming out soon and around

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
the world. We're going to travel the world and look at release

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
dates, and we'll start in America.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
America.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
Coming out this...

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
You said

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
America, Rob, so I was just representing.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
I hope the mic didn't pick that up.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
You know the mic turns off, you know.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Mine doesn't. I was just representing.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
Ooh, thank you. AlphaKananagram in chat brings up a good point.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
The PSP is region-free, so

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
it's less of a pain than region-locked President

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
Cat. Good job.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
Love it. Alright, coming out this week in America,

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
Madden NFL 11.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
Of course, we already talked about that before. It's coming out on the

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
10th, and there's midnight launches going on everywhere.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
And do any games

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
dare to compete against Madden

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
11? I don't think

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
so. There's not a lot else coming out.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
Let me see what counter... There's also tons and tons

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
and tons of

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
peripherals and things coming out.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
But as far as games coming out against

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
Madden 11, nope.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
This is Madden's week. That's it for the US.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
Meanwhile in England, they're like,

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
Madden, that's a game

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
for wankers!

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
We have

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
coming out on the 10th,

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
Dragon Age Golems of Amgarak.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
Um,

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
on 11th, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
On the 12th, yeah, Madden NFL 11.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
Like, anyone's gonna give a crap about it over there.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
Um, 13 is Hoop World.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
And Ship Simulator Extremes.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
That's it.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
I gotta say,

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
just tangent a little bit,

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
I didn't know much about that whole Scott Pilgrim vs.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
the World thing. I didn't realize

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
that it's based on a comic book

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
where clearly the author has a huge

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
boner for video games, because there's so

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
many video game references in it.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
Uh oh, Mystique's coming in.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
And he's Canadian.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
Well then, fuck him!

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
I'm just kidding.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
He's from Canadia. I love Canadia.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
All right.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
Is that near Albonia?

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
Look, look, I have Canadian friends,

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
okay? Okay?

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
I'm sorry. All right.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
I like the Canadianites.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
No, for real though. Uh oh.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
Mystique's coming in.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
We're here. We're here. Flap, flap, flap.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
Because she's wearing, I think, flip flops or something.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
Smack, smack, smack, smack, smack, smack.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
Never mind.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
So, but here's the thing.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
At first I had no interest in seeing the movie

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
because I was like, oh, it's Michael Cera

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
and it's not Arrested Development.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
So why would I care, right?

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
But then I hear it's all about this

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
video game, like, homage.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
And then the whole, like, thing where they actually

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
went to Miyamoto to get the rights to use

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
the Zelda music in the thing.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
And the comic book is about, like, he goes

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
to defeat the ex-boyfriends

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
who are, like, the seven bosses.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
Or, I shouldn't say they're not

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
all ex-boyfriends.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
One of them's a girl, but still.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
It's like the harem of boss monsters

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
that are the exes of this chick

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
he's interested in. It's like the plot.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
And I'm like, that actually sounds, like,

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
kind of awesome in an 11-year-old way.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
I want to go see it.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
Let's go see it.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
I think that movie does sound completely sweet.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
So I had no idea.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
Dan, take me on a date.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
I'm not dating all of you.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
Misty.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
Misty Wood.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
I'll take Mystique out on a date.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
Because Alan's in San Francisco, so Mystique

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
can be my date.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
But no Nookie.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
Rob's got jungle fever.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
If we call

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
Alan, can we watch?

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
Stop it.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
Stop it.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
They're filthy, disgusting pervs.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
You hang out with us.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
Xbox 360 in Japan. How about Japanese

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
releases? I guess.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
Here's a sport they love in Japan. Baseball.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
Major League Baseball 2K10 is out from 2K Sports

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
this week in Japan. And it can't even sell

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
there.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
I think it does alright over there.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
I don't know. They're big, big.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
They got the big boner for baseball in Japan.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
Even bigger than here.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
MLB 2K.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
Sports of Japan.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
Sumo and Baseball.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
That might actually be their big release this week.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
But I have to say this. On the Nintendo Wii.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
It's not this week. It's coming out August 26th.

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
But I'm sorry. This is the greatest name for

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
video game ever. Are you ready for this?

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
On the Wii. This is super spanking massage.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
Close. August 26th. You ready?

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
Twinkle Queen.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
Wait.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
Are you sure that's not in the Twinkle Star Sprites

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
family? I think it is.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
Even if it is.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
It's called Twinkle Queen. Oh no. It's a fighting game.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
It's a fighting game with chicks.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
Because we've never seen that before.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
That was like fun.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
That's on the 26th. That's not this week.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
But I just wanted to take a moment to acknowledge Twinkle Queen.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
It looks like the baseball game is the only big

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
release in Japan this week. Oh no. I lied.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
On the PSP. Oh awesome.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
Corpse Party is the name of the game.

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
Corpse Party Blood Covered

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
Repeated Fear is coming out in a

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
regular and limited edition.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
It looks like some type of survival-ish

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
horror game with a very 8-bit style to it.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
And there's a chick.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
They're wearing Sakura uniforms.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
They're just wearing school girl uniforms.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
But I guess they're having a Corpse Party?

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
I don't know.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
Remember last week that

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
Scary Stories game came out.

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
Oh that's right. But that was just like public domain

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
stories on the DS right? Yeah.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
Kazoku Keikaku

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
comes out on the PSP this week.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
It looks like the less scary alternative

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
if you want to play.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
Because these girls are eating and this girl

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
looks like she's farting on another one. I don't know what's happening there.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
But whatever.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
So it's family something.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
Maybe it's the family fucking something.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
Apparently this is the month of no men

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
in Japan because none of these games

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
have men in them. They're all girls.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
All the time. As it should be.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
By the way, from Robocoon

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
in our chat room, I don't know if this is from Wikipedia

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
or what, but giving us the background on

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
The series is about 23-year-old Canadian

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
Scott Pilgrim, a slacker hero

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
and part-time bassist who is living in Toronto

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
and plays bass guitar in the band

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
Sex Bob-omb. He falls

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
in love with American delivery girl

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
Ramona V. Flowers but must defeat her

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
seven evil ex-boyfriends in order to date

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
her. And that's the plot of the movie.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
That's cute. Oh it does sound cute. By the way

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
Dan, will you defeat my seven exes

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
to date me?

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
That probably wouldn't be very hard. One of the

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
rival bands in the game

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
or in the comics is called

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
Clash at Demonhead. Nice.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
See, that's how you knew that guy

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
had a boner for video games.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
People don't know that game unless they're...

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
Sex Bob-omb is awesome too.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
Clash at Demonhead, that's

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
pretty obscure.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
That's awesome.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
The game is actually really, really cool

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
by the way. Why are you having a Squeak, ArcSaga?

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
Because I watched the trailer for this

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
and I totally, totally, totally, totally, totally

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
want this game. What are you talking about?

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
Sonic Colors.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
Oh wow.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
What? The theme song

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
is awesome. The theme song is

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
Cheeseballtastic and I love it. But not good.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
But not in the way that everyone's

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
Super Sonic Racing.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
But it's Sonic Colors

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
is coming out. Oh dammit. I was trying to

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
play it here in studio. There's a stupid ad on this.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
Hold on, we'll get through the ad and then we'll...

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
It's not a good ad. It's a stupid ad. Well at any rate, in Europe

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
the game is coming out November 12th

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
and it's

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
actually the Sonic Team

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
head, Izuka Takashi

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
is the

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
big dude

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
who is handling the game

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
and it's pretty and it's really pretty.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
Happy, happy, happy, happy, happy.

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
Look at this and tell me this is gorgeous.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
It looks cute.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
That's hit buffering.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
It did the same thing for me.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
Alright, whatever. There you go.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
Good enough.

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
At any rate,

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
it looks intensely, intensely

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
fun.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
It reminded me just of how

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
excited I was about Sonic Adventure.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
And there's no shadow.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
There's no all these other characters.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
It's just freakin' Sonic and Tails.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
It looks cute as hell. I'll give you that.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
SSG-100 Matt is in our chat

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
room saying Rob's band, speaking

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
of Scott Pilgrim's band and the Rival band.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
Rob's band is Boom Boom Kitty Fuck.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
I don't know where that comes from.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
That was from

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
Jay.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
Can I call you Boom Boom Kitty Fuck?

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
No, wasn't it?

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
The nickname that he gave his...

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
Boo Boo Kitty Fuck.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
There's a difference between Boom Boom and Boo Boo.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
It's crossed over with Boom Boom Dollar.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
The mashup of the century.

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
That would be a great band name actually.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
Boom Boom Kitty Fuck. Boom Boom Dollar.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
That was almost the name of the show actually,

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
but we went with Orange Honch Radio. It was almost

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
Boom Boom Dollar Radio, but sadly.

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
That would have been pretty bad. I actually

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
want to say, no, I'm not fucking with you.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
That was on the list of names.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
In the long run, that would have been pretty bad.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
Finally, wasn't it? We should just do like

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
Orange Lounge.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
I think it was the idea that we

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
would be lounging around talking

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
and it made sense. I had a

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
migraine our first show.

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
You didn't really start

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
actually 100%

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
being on the show until about the 4th or 5th

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
episode. It's because I had to sleep in the Harry

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
Potter closet.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
Remember? Yes. I was at the

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
Gay Frat House. Good times.

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
In the Harry Potter closet. True story people.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
By the way, if you want old episodes of

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
OLR, they're out there.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
I'm going to warn you though, old OLR

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
is nothing like new OLR.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
He means out there.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
It is just wow.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
Wow have we come a long

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
way in 8 years. We haven't come far

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
but it's still a long way.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
We've come away.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
We have evolved but the spirit lives on.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
If you listen to episode 1,

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
it really is a lot like tonight's

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
show actually where it just

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
isn't really about anything.

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
No, I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
It was a lot shorter though. It was. We used to only

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
have a 2 hour show and now we're like 4 hours.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
I don't know. Anyhow.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
Rob, more. More?

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
How about more Sonic? I'll tell you more Sonic.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
It's a hack of Sonic 2.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
It's called the Dimps edition

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
and it's a ROM hack of Sonic 2

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
that apparently is supposed to make it more

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
like Sonic 4 and there's actually this

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
little trailer that's out there.

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
It got flagged on YouTube.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
Denied. Oh well.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
There was a trailer out there on YouTube.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
It's actually available for download so you can hack the ROM

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
there and what's weird

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
about this though, they're not trying to do it

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
to actually say like, oh hey we're

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
excited for Sonic 4. No no.

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
They're adding the features to try

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
and point out how awful they are.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
I don't know though. I think there would be a lot of people

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
that would get this to kind of like see the cool

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
new features. I don't know. Sonic 4 didn't look terrible

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
to me. But whatever. This is why I need Sonic

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
colors. It's a very interesting form of protest.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
Did you miss that a couple shows ago?

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
Matt brought that up. It's the Sonic

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
cat that you get for pre-ordering it.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
And it actually looks like a... Pre-order!

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
Alright. Don't look at

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
me.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
Alright. Well speaking of classic games

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
such as Sonic 2 and well really any

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
Sonic in general.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
We like to take a trip through the

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
gaming vault and find a classic

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
game of the week. The Dark Sakura says hey

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
listen

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
you damn kids. You ought to be

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
playing this game and showing a little

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
respect.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
It's called the classic video game

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
of the week. Dark Sakura what is

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
tonight's classic video game of the week?

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
Shadow Dancer. Specifically the Mega Drive

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
slash Genesis version.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
Imagine that. A Genesis game inspired by

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
your Genesis.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
Well. Um.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
Although I. Now this

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
is one of the games that I had Dan

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
playing for me last night.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
I love him.

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
It's just

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
Shinobi.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
It's actually. Dan this is my second

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
shut up.

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
Anyway. Um.

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
This is

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
this. This is the

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
sequel to Shinobi and it actually is different than the

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
arcade version. The Mega Drive

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
version of Shadow Dancer. The secret of

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
Shinobi. It came out on December 1st

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
1990 in Japan. And

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
the releases came out in North America and Europe afterwards.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
And it's on the virtual console.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
Um. And also in the

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
Sega Genesis collection for PS2 and

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
PSP. Dude that dog just ate that guys

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
face. I know right. This one has a dog.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
What. You have a

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
ninja dog.

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
How freaking cool is that.

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
Anyway. Um. The main guy

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
did not have a name in

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
the um. In the uh.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
Arcade version. And this one

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
though he's called Hayate.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
And his dog is

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
and he's actually supposed to be the son of

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
Joe Musashi from

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
the original Shinobi.

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
Um. However

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
that was in the Japanese version. In the US version

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
he's just

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
Joe Musashi. Um. The dog's name is

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
Yamato.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
Did you know that was the traditional name of Japan?

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
I do not.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
Now you know. That's why

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
this ship was called Yamato.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
Anyway. Um.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
Anyway uh. They're trying to

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
uh. Uh. Avenge

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
this uh. The death of a guy

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
named uh. Kato who

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
was Hayate's mentor.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
Or Musashi's student depending

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
on which version you're playing.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
Um. So yeah. Different stages. Different stuff.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
Um. Instead of looking for

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
time bombs like you did in the uh.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
coin op one you rescue

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
hostages. And

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
your bonus one instead of being the first

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
person ones are where you fall off

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
of the building and shoot ninjas

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
in the face with shuriken.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
Isn't that not amazing?

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
And then they also did a

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
Master System version that was out in Europe and Brazil

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
because remember like we said. They love

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
the Master System in Brazil.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
And um. But this one was

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
actually a direct um. port

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
of the arcade version.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
And it came out

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
on the computer. For home computer

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
by US Gold.

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
And

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
it's uh.

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
Pretty. Pretty hardcore. And yeah I didn't

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
do the first Kenobi because honestly I like this one better.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
Cause you have

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
a ninja dog.

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
Tell me.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
Dance in the other room and play ninja dog.

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
That should just be a video game right there.

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
Ninja dog. Yes.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
Alright. I want

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
a ninja dog.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
And then I want my cat to be the big fat

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
geisha.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
Is that it then? That's it?

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
Yes. Alright. Classic game of the week is

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
Shadow Dancer.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
I want to say you did like

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
one of the other shinobi games before.

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
I think I actually did shinobi before.

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
You probably did. I want to say I've

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
seen that in the uh. But Shadow Dancer is freaking

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
amazing. Cause you have a ninja dog.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
I get the ninja

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
dog thing. Dog.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
Alright. Named Yamato.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000

east-ish coast. It's all the east coast

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
to me even though she's really from the midwest

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
But she flew out here to be with us so we really

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
appreciate it. And we have tacos. Yes.

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
And we are all eating Mystique's tacos right now

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
and they're delicious I must say.

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
It's great. So uh

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
needs more salt though. No I'm kidding I'm kidding.

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
Alright cause they're low sodium

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
get it? Alright anyway. Uh

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
no actually they were really good. I

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
would never have guessed that they were any type

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
of special diet tacos.

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
Anyhow um

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
I'm kind of tired today you guys and I

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
apologize I'm really tired but

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
um last night I actually

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
I did something I've been wanting to do

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
for like 10 years and

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
never have had the opportunity to

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
until last night. And

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
um that was I went and saw

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
Showgirls in a theater.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
Mystique is laughing.

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
Get in here Mystique. Mystique.

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
You actually paid to see Showgirls?

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
Yes I paid. Well actually no I got

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
Alan to pay. Alan paid

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
15

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
15 dollars a ticket. No this isn't in

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:49.000

Unless you don't have a uni-boob do you?

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
No they're the twins but I just call them my jubbles.

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000

You would. Shut up.

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
I had a girlfriend uh yes

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
believe it or not when I was like 16.

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
See I'm not surprised about that either. I had a girlfriend

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
and her name was Chuck. No no

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
Her she named her boobies

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
and her boobies names get this

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
Wow.

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
Now we know why Rob is gay.

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
You know what

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
if dudes can name their junk

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
women can name their tits.

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
That's

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
very true. It's a free country.

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
Mine are just my

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
boobs.

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
The girls. Misty?

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
I'm not even gonna ask. She'll

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
throw that bottle of Mountain Dew at me. Alright

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
uh let's see

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
Now why would I waste mine and do like that?

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
Frisbee says kibbles and bits.

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
I want to know great

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
boob names. Like I know that has nothing to

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
do with gaming but I don't care.

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
I need to know good boob names.

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
So Dia says hers are named.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
Wait what are uh

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
She's not saying what they are. Oh bummer.

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
Come on. You open that bag.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
Now let the cat out.

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
Alright. Tiger Claw

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
says you can just call them bean bags because you know you

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
want to sleep on top of them. That actually is one

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
really good use of boobies. Like you know

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
sometimes when you're watching a movie and cuddling

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
with the fag hag there's you know boobies

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
that you can kind of you know rest your weary

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
head on. So there you go.

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
I think boobs are great. They are.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
I think that they actually sell boob pillows in Japan.

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
And wrist rest

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
for your mouth so they are boobies.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
Oh I've seen the hand pillows.

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
But they also sell laps that are like

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
maids. Maids laps.

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
For people

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
to lean on and sleep.

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
Interesting. It's that whole

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
mole thing you know. Alright.

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
Fair enough. Alright anyhow

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
I don't know what that had to do with games but boy

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
wasn't it fun. Alright. Man is a weird

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
place.

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
Let's see. Okay this is great.

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
She said my left one is named

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
Righty and the right one is named Lefty so the guy

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
doesn't get confused.

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
SSJ100 Matt says in chat

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
see see see the religious

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
fanatics and gays can both agree

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
on the fact that boobs are fun.

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
You know what we do you know

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
all this propping debate. I can see your dirty

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
pillows.

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
What? Didn't you see

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
Carrie? Do not want. Oh.

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
Years ago. Years ago.

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
They're all gonna laugh at you. Alright.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
No. They're all gonna

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
laugh at you. Let's

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
derail the show further shall we?

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
And how. Alright let's get into Twitter topics.

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
Let's let the listeners control

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
the show with topics for a little bit.

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
Sweet.

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
Taco.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
You can't run out to get a taco while we're trying to do

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
Twitter topics. She ran out to get a taco.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
This is not

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
taco topics. It's Twitter topics.

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
Taco time.

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
Let's go Twitter topics. Alright.

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
You ready Dan? I'm ready. There's a game

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
Robocoon gets our first taco

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
topic tonight. Saying that there is

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
a game called Privates

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
that is now out on the PC.

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
This is the sex game.

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
Yes this is the one

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
where like I think you play these

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
little sperm-y condom looking guys

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
and yeah

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
you have a Windows computer

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
and

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
you can download this game now and

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
I guess it's a game that teaches you about

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
sex. Does it work with Kinect?

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
No it's a PC game.

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
For now.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
You never know.

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
Let's see TigerClaw

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
305 sends us lots and lots

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
of links tonight. We're going to do a

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
couple of these here. First off

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
I think this is actually

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
really cool. All joking and laughing and boob

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
talk aside this is actually a really great story here.

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
The Kinect is going to be able to

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
recognize sign language. As long

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
as you're not sitting on the couch.

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
The

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
Kinect will actually recognize

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
American Sign Language and

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
it's due to a patent I guess that's out there.

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
If you are proficient in sign

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
language you can actually get the

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
Xbox 360 to recognize

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
the letters that you're doing in sign.

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
That's a great way to learn too.

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
Apparently though even if you don't know ASL

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
you somehow will be able to

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
lip read. That's pretty specific

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
for the Kinect. That's also kind of scary

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
if you think about it. They're saying

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
that instead of voice chat you may be

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
able to actually sign.

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
You need to learn how to start signing all that

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
foul language you hear on Xbox Live because

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
that's what this will be useful for.

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
I know how to sign.

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
I know how to say bitch in sign language.

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
I bet you do.

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
I'm sure we know the same

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
one Dan. This is less awesome

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
but this is something that TigerClaw sends.

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
It must be reported on. It is news.

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
Billy Mitchell has taken back the

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
Donkey Kong record.

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
It happened on August 7th 2010.

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
He reclaimed Donkey Kong

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
and Donkey Kong Jr.

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
Billy Mitchell is laying the smackdown.

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
That's right. He is not to be

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
fucked with. There it is.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
He's like Steve Weeby sucks.

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
Whatever his name is. Hank Chien.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
The dentist. Goodbye.

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
That's right. Off with you.

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
It happened at Boomers Grand Prix Arcade

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
in Florida verified

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
live by Twin Galaxies

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
Refs. That's it.

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
2 hours and 42 minutes

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
for Donkey Kong. 3 hours and 58 minutes

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
for Donkey Kong Jr.

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
I think I like this. He

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
stopped right after he

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
got past Hank Chien's score

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
and Mitchell said

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
quote, some say I'm being cocky.

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
Some say I'm being lazy.

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
I say I'm being Billy Mitchell.

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
Well because he wants

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
to have that record broken again.

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
He wants to be

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
able to keep one upping it because he really

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
does know that he is

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
that much better than everybody else

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
at Donkey Kong.

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
You know whether

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
you love Mitchell or

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
you hate him and you know you hate him. Everybody hates

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
Billy Mitchell. The guy

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
you know is the best in

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
the world at that game.

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
SSG100Matt sends us a tweet

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
about NHL 11

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
because we love sports games here at OLR.

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
There's nothing we love more than sports games.

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
And how?

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
If I'm going to play a sports game, why are there all these

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
giggling women in the other room?

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
Mystique's on the phone with our friend Beanie and Beanie said they had

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
tacos too.

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
Is it Taco Day?

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
The people in front of us at the supermarket

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
were buying the ingredients were buying the stuff to make

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
Mexican food.

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
Did I miss the memo? I was not aware it was

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
Taco Day. I thought Taco Day was

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
Tuesday.

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
You know who started that branding?

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
Me. Did you? I started Taco Tuesday.

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
I don't know.

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
That was a Del Taco thing.

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
I invented the internet.

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
Can I talk about NHL 11?

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
Yes.

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
There is download content.

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
It's all priced between 80 and 160

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
Microsoft points.

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
They're like player boosts where you can

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
actually give yourself high boosts

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
of 5 and 1 and 3 and so forth.

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
Get this.

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
156 different pieces

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
of download content.

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
Because EA doesn't have enough money.

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
Well they needed to

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
buy a soul.

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
Apparently.

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
What would EA do with a soul but

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
sell it? I don't know. That's kind of screwed up

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
I guess. For more Madden rights.

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
Because really you're paying to basically make your characters

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
better.

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
Learn to play.

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
SSG100 Matt

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
in our chat says hockey is being derailed

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
for tacos. Oh the humanity.

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
Tacos.

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
Frisbee gets kudos

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
for saying Billy Mitchell. I'm number one

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
at making sauce.

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
Tacos own hockey.

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
I'm saucy.

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
For real he sells

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
sauce on the internet.

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
I love the idea of a new sport

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
called Hocko's or Taki.

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
Or Taki.

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
And it would be hockey

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
played with tacos.

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
But they have to be like you know steal tacos.

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
Yeah. Alright. Steal tacos.

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
Blades of tacos.

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
Blades of tacos.

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
What's DS Master

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
doing allowed in the chat? They skate

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
on tacos.

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
Wow.

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
That would get messy.

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
But that would be fun.

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
I just can't DS Master.

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
Have fun. Alright.

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
Moving on. Let's see. What the hell is DS Master?

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
Lame. Some guy.

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
AK Ripper and USOC

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
says this week's episode

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
is awesome. Indeed.

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
This is also AK Ripper's

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
first time listening to Oella. No I'm kidding.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
Alright. He calls in a lot.

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
Blue Swim sends us some

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
tweets. I'm just getting into

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
Dreamcast import gaming.

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
Boy you're about

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
15 years late now. I'm kidding. You want

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
Blue Stinger. What DC

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
games not already out in the US

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
somehow are worth importing.

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
The only Dreamcast imports I've got are

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
Fire Pro Wrestling D and Giant

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
Gram 2000. Which means he spent

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
8 bucks.

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
He probably downloaded them off the

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
inner tubes. Actually the Japanese version of

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
Blue Stinger is better than the US one.

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
The Japanese version of Blue Stinger is much better

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
than the US one. What about

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
isn't it the Japanese? No that was on the

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
Saturn. I was thinking Symphony of the Night but that's

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
on the Saturn. Yeah that's on the Saturn. What other

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
import awesome Dreamcast games are there?

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
Hold on. There's yeah.

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
Dark Soccer is going to the vault.

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
There's almost too many to go into.

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
Well while Dark Soccer runs to the vault

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
I will take other tweets.

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
She's going to come back with a bunch of terrible suggestions.

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
Spazinator sends us a tweet.

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
Apparently it's a leaked video

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
of the Castlevania Lords of Shadow Game.

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
Oh ha ha ha. He tried to

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000
Rickroll us but I had it on mute.

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
That's why I usually don't

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000
click on YouTube links but he cleverly

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
disguised it behind a bit.

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
Kick him.

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
I can't kick somebody off Twitter. If I could I would

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
for that. No I would just

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000
kick him. I think everything

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
in this box came out in the US.

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000
And

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
why do we have two copies of Capcom vs

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
SNK? Because

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
we're that awesome. No one

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
of them's the pro edition.

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
I gave him the best kick I could over Twitter.

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
I just sent him a tweet that said THWACK.

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
Boot to the head.

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
Alright let's see.

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
DJ Blazekin. Ever wonder what it would

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
be like to have DJ Hero on the NES?

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
No.

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
Neither has anybody

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
else. Well apparently

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
there is actually out there in the world

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
an 8 bit version of DJ Hero.

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
This is the same guy. He downgraded

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
some other games on the NES too. Here it is

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000
folks.

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
These videos are always so bad

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
it gives me cancer.

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
What song is this?

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000
Hangin' Tough.

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
What song is this?

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000
Oh it's

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
Queen.

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000
This game

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
sucks bad. Nobody bought

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
it.

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
You don't buy it Dan.

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
It's a hack. No I'm just talking about

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000
DJ Hero.

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
You have no idea how hard I tried to sell

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000
that game. You know what made it sell?

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
When it went down to like 80% off

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
it sold like crazy and now it's a hit.

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000
People bought it. Anyhow.

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000
One more tweet. Can I do one more tweet?

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
By the way I did go through the box

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
and I think everything that we have in the box

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
came out in the US. But

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000
P.O.P.O. Da. I really like that game.

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
Hide with Thunder.

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
Someone imports Dan you dork.

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000
Well you can't say it and give Blue Swim at least

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000
one or two suggestions.

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000
Let's see.

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000
Orange Rite.

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000
Because it almost makes it sound like Orange

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
L.R. is

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000
right or something like that. Orange Rite

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
says his tweet saying Konami is

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
going to have a DDR party at Royal Tea

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000
Cafe to celebrate their first DDR

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000
for the PS3. Naoki will be

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
there live DJing. I did hear

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
about this actually. Too far

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
away or I would want to go. Yeah it's in Culver City

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
California which is in SoCal. It's a little

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
far especially for a weeknight because it's on August

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000
12th which is like this week.

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
But hey if we have folks in the area

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000
by all means go. I'm going to try to send

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000
DJ Tyrant. He's in SoCal

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
and he's done some freelancing for the website so I'll

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000
see if he can go and like cover this

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000
for us. We don't have jobs we're going.

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000
No I'm just kidding.

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000
We ain't got no money.

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
Oh I know you could use the show

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000
funds. Oh wait

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000
we don't have show funds.

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
I've been too poor to donate.

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000
We had show funds once.

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000
Now we have a soundboard.

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000
And I got to go to California Extreme

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000
two years ago. Alright. Tiger Claw

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
saying I missed one of his tweets. I'm sorry Tiger Claw

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
there's a two tweet maximum. Too bad.

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000
How does it feel?

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000
Huh? Huh? Nah I

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
I appreciate what Tiger Claw does for the show

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
I do but I have to spread. It's not the

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000
Tiger Claw segment. It's the Twitter Claw

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
Twitter Claw segment. I actually

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000
said the Twitter Claw segment.

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000
Shit. Alright.

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000
Totally missed my point.

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000
Tiger Claw contingency. Alright.

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000
How about more news shall we?

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000
And how? How about it?

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
This is like freaky fucking

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000
scary to me. This reminds me of a

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
scene in the Clockwork Orange and I don't like it.

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000
Although I love the name

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000
of the company who made this because their name

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000
is Waterloo Labs.

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000
Do you get it?

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000
Hold on I have to sorry for the dead air but I have to

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000
bring this up like I need I need music

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
if I'm going to report on a story from Waterloo

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
Labs here. This is mandatory

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
that I have a story here.

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
Alright no seriously Waterloo

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
Labs they have developed

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
an electrode system that actually

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000
measures your eye movement and

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
uses it to control

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
Super Mario Brothers.

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
That's right. So look at this dude

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000
here. He actually has his eyes. Actually

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000
I'll stop the Abba here for a minute and the listeners

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
rejoice. And you can actually watch

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
this guy in this little video here.

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000
Alright blah blah blah blah blah.

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
Looks like they're in like a

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
garage. Not like a

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000
garage like at your house.

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000
It's like when we were at the OLR

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000
studio. We are at the

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
OLR studio. And it's just a

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000
spare bedroom.

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000
Alright.

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000
It looks like these guys are in like

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000
their garage. It looks like they're in like a mechanics

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000
garage. It's hilarious. I don't want to see these

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000
guys like just talk about their stupid device.

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000
There we go. There's the guy playing. Oh my god

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000
he actually looks up to jump.

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
And the guy does jump.

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000
That is and they

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
kind of move their head a little bit though. That's kind of

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
cheating. I bet he can't get to the line in this world.

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000
I'd like to see him run through 8-1

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000
always running like that.

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000
That is freaky to me.

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000
Oh see look at him die.

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000
Boo.

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
Now Rob though you know they've had this before.

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
What? The Atari Mindlink.

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.000
Really? Yeah Atari in the

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000
80's marketed a controller

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
that was going to play by your brainwaves.

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000
But it actually played by the way that you

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
moved your head.

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
Like your forehead? Yeah.

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000
It worked on your eyebrow muscles.

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000
Snake oil. Exactly. Never released.

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000
It was a

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000
famous vaporware.

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
I don't think Waterloo Labs

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
actually plans to do anything with this. Waterloo.

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
I know right. Napoleon did

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000
surrender. Napoleon.

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
Whatever

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000
it made for a great YouTube and got their little

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
lab all over blogs and on

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000
our show so congrats. There you go.

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000
This website though that I

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000
tried to find the picture on it actually

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
shows some Atari wireless

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000
controllers that have these big antennas and

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000
this thing and then an orthopedic shoe and it's

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
labeled which one is the orthopedic shoe.

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000
It looks like

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
somebody in our chat room MOTC

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000
I don't know if that's short for something. Sorry.

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000
Is like going crazy trying to get the DDR

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000
event information.

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000
So if you're going I want a phone call next

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000
week dude.

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
And by the way Orange Right actually

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000
joined our chat room and actually changed the name to

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.000
Orange LR is right. So there we go.

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000
Alright. Thank you very much.

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
Appreciate it. Well done sir. Well done.

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
And Tiger Claw like the

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000
Google Ninja he is right there with the Wikipedia

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000
article to the Atari

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.000
mind link. I want to see a picture

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000
of this thing and see if it was scary looking.

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000
I posted one in the chat room.

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000
Go to the Atari History Museum. Hold on. Hold on.

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000
The link is on the wiki page. Hold on.

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
I'm on it. I'm on it. I'm on it.

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
Let's see.

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000
Oh I see it. There it is.

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000
That looks dumb.

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
It was. That made for

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000
great. It never worked.

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000
I guess there was a game called Mind Maze.

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000
Also that dude is wearing loafers with

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000
no socks.

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000
It was the 80's.

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000
MOTC has finals that night and can't

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000
attend the DDR party.

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000
Fire. Blow them off.

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000
Skip school. No I'm kidding.

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000
Dark Sakura.

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000
What do you have for us? Stuff.

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000
Actually this is something that perhaps

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000
Dan might be interested in.

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
Maybe. Maybe.

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000
Well actually it's

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000
he couldn't do anything with it because it's only

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
for Europe.

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000
The European special editions

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000
have

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000
two special editions actually.

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
There's the signature addiction

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000
that's like the US collector's edition.

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
It has a metal case.

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
A miniature SLS AMG

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
It comes with a toy car.

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000
Model car.

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000
It comes with a V6 engine.

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000
A USB flash drive.

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000
A wallet.

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000
And an entry into a contest to win a Mercedes-Benz.

01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.000
And vouchers for 11 download content

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000
vehicles. A key fob.

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000
An art book. A driving strategy

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000
mini magazine.

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000
And it's going to be

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000
$179.99.

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
There's another special edition too.

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000
It's all that stuff. It comes

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000
to the trunk of a Z06 Corvette

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000
and it costs $70,000.

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000
And then

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000
there's another one

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000
if you don't have as much money which is $79.99

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
Euro.

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000
It's the collector's edition that has a slip

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
cover.

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
Some art cards.

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000
The download content

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000
vouchers and the driving magazines

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000
that came with the other version.

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000
So you can decide

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000
if you want to

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000
have the cool version

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000
or the oh my god can I win the Mercedes

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000
version. Well let's keep in mind that's Euro.

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000
So that's like what a buck and a half

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000
a buck seventy five per Euro.

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000
Or you could just buy the god damn

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000
game by itself and be happy with it.

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000
I'll do the conversion right now.

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000
I want to get the US collector's edition

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000
but I don't think I'm going to spring for it. What's in the US

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000
collector's edition?

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.000
It comes with a toy car.

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000
Bunch of DLC. Art book.

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000
A book.

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000
Soundtrack. Just all kinds of

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000
stuff. And I like Gran Turismo

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000
and after I'm like yeah

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
yeah I'll do that. And I'm like what it's

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000
like 150 bucks?

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
Jesus no.

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
Alright going to another game

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000
that's coming out later this year here in the US

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000
and the UK. I think it's in the UK

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
this year.

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000
240 bucks.

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000
Got some money.

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000
Hey a new mode in

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000
GoldenEye that kind of

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
throws you back to an old mode. Here's the thing

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000
there used to be a mode if you remember in GoldenEye

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000
on the N64 it was called DK

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
mode. And that was the mode where you would all

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
have the giant heads.

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000
It made all the enemies

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000
and people in the game have these gigantic

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000
heads and they all had

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000
what they would call the proportions of Donkey

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000
Kong because at that time Rare

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
was making of course this game and they were making

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
the Donkey Kong games on Super Nintendo right?

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000
So is Donkey Kong mode coming back?

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000
No of course not stupid

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000
because Activision has the rights now and they

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
don't own the rights to Donkey Kong.

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000
So it's not coming back. But

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000
what they did and this is clever

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000
they've decided to do a instead of big

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
heads they now have

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000
big hands.

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
That's right there's a big hands

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000
mode that can be activated in multi

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000
players and you get big hands

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000
and this is it. You can only melee

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000
people so it is bitch slap mode basically.

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000
You can only bitch slap the other players

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000
with your giant hands.

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000
That is what it is.

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000
Awesome.

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000
There also by the way is a mode

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
that makes everybody tiny that I believe was in the

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
old game as well. There's a knick knack mode

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000
is what it's called. Am I alone in being

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000
a lot less interested in that game when

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
they're like yeah we're going to redo GoldenEye.

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
Yay. Oh we're

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
going to take Pierce Brosnan out and we're going to put

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
Daniel Craig in. Oh yeah that's

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
that's

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
interesting. That's not a big deal. Whatever.

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000
You see it was those Bond movies

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000
were fine. The new ones were fine. They're awesome.

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000
But GoldenEye is

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000
Brosnan's movie. I

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000
know it's weird but you know

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000
the multiplayer one is fun.

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
I played it at E3

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000
and I'll just say it doesn't even matter. Brosnan's a whore

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000
for money. It's all about Odd

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000
Job anyway because he throws the hat

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000
and it's awesome.

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000
There's a shoe honestly. Honestly.

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000
You fight like a woman.

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000
Frisbee in our chat room is a little upset saying you

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000
can't claim ownership on big heads

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000
and hands etc.

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
Maybe it was just they just didn't want to go there.

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
It's too

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000
too close or something. The conglomerate

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000
that owns what's left of Midway should sue.

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000
Except it was a rare game.

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000
Not Midway. Right but Midway

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000
the big heads thing came along in NBA

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000
Jam.

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000
Back to NBA Jam again.

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000
Shut up Dan.

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
Shut up Dan.

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000
Let's do another news story. Well

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000
for those who are looking forward to Pokemon Black

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
and White that haven't already. Hey Dan here you go.

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000
And how?

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000
That haven't already imported it.

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000
Sorry.

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000
You um

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000
when you play through it the first time

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000
until you beat it you can only

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000
use the new Pokemon.

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000
You don't get the old Pokemons.

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
No Pika.

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000
Pika. Not until you beat the game.

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
Dan you can get some Pika.

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000
Look I understand why they're fighting

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000
like there's a lot of fucking Pokemon

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.000
at this point right like how many Pokemon are there now

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.000
like 700 fucking Pokemon or something like

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000
it's just it's insane and they're all

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000
starting to be like parodies of each other.

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000
I would under I would actually sympathize

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000
with Nintendo if they wanted to say hey look

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000
new game, new system

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000
or actually did they have another

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000
DS? Whatever. New way of playing, new game

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000
new Pokemon.

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000
Stop asking for the old shit. I still want an

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000
actual Pokemon MMO. But it's

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000
weird that they kind of put

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000
the Pokemon in there anyway at the end but I guess it's a

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000
reward to beat the game. I guess.

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000
There you go. I still want a Pokemon MMO

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000
I would play that. Every time there's a

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000
Pokemon story on this show somebody says

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000
why don't they make this an MMO already?

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000
That's a very good question. Because a Pokemon Momo would work.

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000
A Pokemon Momo?

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000
Is that like a

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000
Moomoo? Momo.

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.000
A Pokemon MMO would be

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000
great. It would be. But it would be weird

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000
because Nintendo in their

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000
mission to protect children across the

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.000
world with friends codes how in the hell would an

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000
MMO work? And they keep it

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000
like kid friendly quote unquote.

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000
Would it be like the Disney game where you can only

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000
say certain phrases to people?

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000
That would have to be what would happen.

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000
That ain't my problem. I just think that a Pokemon MMO

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000
would work. Oh well okay.

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000
Screw the kids. That's right. Screw the

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.000
kids. That's right Misty.

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000
I would play the Pokemon MMO

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000
while I ate my Nintendo cereal system

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.000
in my Nintendo pajamas.

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000
It'd be awesome.

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000
Amen.

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000
This is awesome. It's not Pokemon

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
but it's almost as awesome. Torchlight

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000
is coming. Torchlight 2

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000
there's a sequel to the game Torchlight

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000
which if you haven't played honestly they've had this game

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000
on sale on

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000
Steam I don't know how many times

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000
and if you haven't picked it up by now you're a fool

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000
because this game is great. If you like

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000
I have a broken computer. I suppose

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.000
that's an acceptable excuse. And you're a fool.

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000
But Diablo 2.

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.000
Who doesn't like Diablo Diablo 2? If you like those

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000
games you're going to love Torchlight because it's basically half the

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000
same team. But they made this game Torchlight

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:21.000
and they have announced that they are going to be doing a

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.000
sequel. It's going to be in 2011.

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.000
Multiplayer support.

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000
Yay! Because that's what the first game really

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000
badly needed. Torchlight 2

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.000
is going to go above ground

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.000
and it's now going to be on the continent of

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.000
Vilderand. There will still be

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000
deep caverns but there will also be

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:39.000
weather, time of day cycles

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.000
and random events. You're going to be able to play

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.000
online and those of you

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000
that feel burned by Blizzard, LAN.

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000
LAN parties for Torchlight 2.

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000
There you go. That's great. It'll totally

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000
have features that every other game already has.

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.000
Except Starcraft 2. Score!

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.000
No you can't play

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:57.000
Starcraft 2 in it.

01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:59.000
Well you can't play Starcraft 2 on LAN.

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000
They took LAN out of Starcraft 2.

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000
It's kind of a big deal.

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.000
There will be a

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.000
free peer to peer matchmaking service to meet

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000
new players of similar level

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000
and interest. Now I had heard

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.000
that they were going to do an MMO about this.

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:15.000
I guess that is also still in development.

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.000
It's a free to play Torchlight MMO.

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.000
This is not the same game.

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.000
But there is a multiplayer Torchlight game

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:23.000
on the way in 2011.

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000
I think that's exciting to me. I don't know about you guys.

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000
So there you go.

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000
So sweet. Alright.

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000
Well now is the mailbag part of the show except

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000
Jamie is not here so

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.000
we're going to set the mailbag on fire ladies and gentlemen.

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.000
That's going to be another news story.

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000
Damn! Where did I put my lighter?

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:45.000
Every week DarkSakura opens up the email bag at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000
and she reads some emails for us.

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.000
We listen to them live

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.000
as she reads them for us.

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.000
So DarkSakura, why don't you go ahead and read us an email.

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.000
This is some great radio right here.

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.000
Mailbag? No it's not mailbag.

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.000
I had another story.

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000
Not anymore.

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:07.000
The music is playing. Read the mail.

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:09.000
Come on get to it. Mail.

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.000
Mail time.

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.000
Mail call.

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.000
Land shark.

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000
Mail call beats the booty call.

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000
Hey how you doing?

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:21.000
The window is actually closed and I don't know who closed it so whatever.

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000
It was me.

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.000
Okay we can go with that.

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.000
Dan, why don't you pretend you're emailing OrangeLawnsRadio.

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000
What would you say in an email to OrangeLawnsRadio?

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000
Email's up. Dear Rob.

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000
Shut up Dan. Dan should be on this show way more often.

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000
For real Dan. Shut up.

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000
He is so cool and such a pimp.

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000
Hello all our crew. Blade3 here.

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.000
Just wanted to say keep up the great work with the shows.

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000
I can't. Shows?

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.000
We have more than one show?

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000
I can't live without them.

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.000
You're show-wa.

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.000
Not shows. Show-wa.

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.000
I'd like more shows.

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:57.000
Keep my week going and with school starting this week I'll need you more than ever.

01:54:57.000 --> 01:55:03.000
And by the way PlayStation Move is stupid and I think Loki should smack everyone who buys one when he gets back thanks.

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.000
Punctuation.

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.000
Loki's never coming back.

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.000
Yes he is.

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.000
Oh god help us all.

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:15.000
We have one show but I think he means shows as in you know there's been 377 episodes.

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:21.000
Although I will say Extrofer and I really want to do the other show and I think I have a great concept now.

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:27.000
Now that I don't have school on the nights you had available.

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:29.000
I would like to do that still. It would be fun.

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.000
I want to do a show.

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.000
The Dan show.

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:35.000
Not by myself.

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:37.000
What would a Dan show sound like if Dan was by himself with a microphone?

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:41.000
I have a mic. Words.

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.000
See?

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.000
The Dan and Mystique show.

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.000
Oh shit.

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:49.000
All who oppose us would perish.

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:51.000
Second email.

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:53.000
Greetings number one show in the continental US.

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:55.000
We're the greatest in the galaxy.

01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:57.000
Yeah we're actually the greatest in the galaxy.

01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.000
Although when we had that decree.

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.000
Do you have the decree?

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.000
The decree does not say the number one.

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.000
It just says the official.

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.000
I had tape stuck to it.

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.000
But I'll take number one.

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000
What is going on over there?

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.000
Official decree.

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:17.000
Orange Lounge Radio is the official video game podcast of the galaxy forever.

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.000
It doesn't say number one video game podcast.

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:21.000
But it is the official video game podcast.

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:23.000
Which makes it number one.

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.000
Now that we have been voted the number one show in the continental US.

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.000
I guess Hawaii would beat us or something.

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:29.000
Meaning like all those one up shows.

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.000
Unofficial.

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000
Not official.

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:35.000
Giant bomb. It's not official.

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000
Totally not official.

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.000
Reading the email.

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:43.000
I just heard a story on NPR about talks between Google and Verizon about paying extra for used bandwidth.

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:49.000
Decided that people who stream video and music and especially online gamers will pay a lot extra for the bandwidth used.

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:53.000
This is very troubling to me since I'm an online gamer primarily.

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:59.000
Google seems to be the last straw and if they give in all the dominoes will start falling.

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:05.000
I'm wondering why I haven't heard more of an outcry from the gamer community about this bandwidth issue.

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:09.000
Since it has been behind the scenes for a while now.

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:13.000
I also wonder what game studios and developers think of this.

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.000
I don't know what I'll do if rates go up anymore.

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.000
What do you guys think?

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.000
I got this.

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.000
Honestly you are the podcast I look forward to all week.

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.000
Your loyal turtle in Philly.

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.000
Serious turtle.

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000
Did you say turdie?

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:29.000
Shut up.

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000
Wouldn't that come out as Tilly?

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:33.000
Dan you had a comment on this email?

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:37.000
Yes. The reason there's no outcry about it is because if it's going to happen it's going to happen.

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:43.000
There's literally nothing you can do to stop the cable companies from eventually getting to charge you for bandwidth.

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:45.000
Actually there is something you could do.

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:47.000
Cancel your cable.

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.000
Cancel your cable.

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:51.000
Ultimately at the end of the day it's going to be your dollars that decide.

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:59.000
Keep in mind. The other thing to keep in mind. Cable is slowly spreading through more and more neighborhoods and so forth.

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:03.000
And if you're also willing to make the sacrifice to go to something like DSL which might not be as fast.

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:09.000
You know perhaps there will be DSL competitors that are going to have an open internet that won't charge for this stuff.

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:13.000
You know AT&T still competes with Comcast still competes with neighborhood providers and so forth.

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:17.000
Don't get me wrong folks. I think this sucks too.

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:23.000
But I'm just saying it might not be like you know eternal damnation for all of us.

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:27.000
I mean like there's going to be a limit that people are going to hit and they'll just cancel it.

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:31.000
Well because it's already started. The phone companies are doing it you know.

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:38.000
But there will always be somebody out there who's going to say hey you pay a little bit more and you can be unlimited.

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:44.000
The hope is that two things will happen. Number one competition will keep things cheap.

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:49.000
You know because there is more than one answer.

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:54.000
So if cable says okay we're charging you and DSL says oh no we're not.

01:58:54.000 --> 01:59:00.000
You know everybody will jump over to DSL and cable will lose all their money so they'll come back around.

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:06.000
The other thing that you're kind of looking at with the whole cable or with the whole unlimited bandwidth thing.

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:11.000
Is that there are you know God help us government factions and that at work.

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:19.000
Where the argument is that because the internet now is practically essential for life.

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:23.000
That they'll get involved to keep price gouging from happening.

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:25.000
You know but who knows what's going to happen.

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:29.000
The truth is we're just going to have to you know gamers online people.

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:35.000
You know the bit torrent people who are the ones who are really screwed it up for everybody by sucking down massive amounts of bandwidth.

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:45.000
24-7, 365. Yeah you heard that. What's going to really happen is you know we're all going to have to deal with it.

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:51.000
And hopefully yeah we don't get we don't get punked too hard.

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:55.000
I would think they'd go after the torrenters first but I don't know.

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:57.000
The thing is though everyone's a torrenter now.

01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:58.000
Yeah that's true.

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:08.000
There's so many people who do it that you know it's one of their big ideas especially because you know Comcast now is a media conglomerate.

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:19.000
So for them anything they can do to shut down a torrenter protects in their eyes their other you know their movie studio, TV studio, whatever connections.

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:25.000
So you know they yeah they want the bandwidth plus you know anything they can get away with charging us a little bit more money.

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:28.000
You know they want that money. Give me that money.

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:29.000
Give me all your money.

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:31.000
Give me all your money. Give me your money.

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:34.000
Well that's is that it for the e-mail bag tonight?

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:35.000
Yes it is.

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:44.000
All right mail bag at orange lounge radio dot com if you want to send us an e-mail in the future and hopefully you won't have to pay extra money through Comcast or whoever your service provider is to do so.

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:46.000
I know it's still free right now.

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:51.000
In the meantime how about some angst, some anger, some FUs.

02:00:51.000 --> 02:01:06.000
Hubba hubba hubba.

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:09.000
FU to my software shield.

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:12.000
I defeated you.

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:17.000
And my hand for not being able to not hurt.

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:20.000
I'm about to go take some Vicodin.

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:30.000
My FU of the week goes to the fact that my weekend is almost over because I actually had a pretty awesome weekend between you know showgirls and other stuff.

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:33.000
Just you know I'm sad but whatever.

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:35.000
Life sucks.

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:37.000
Life sucks you know.

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:38.000
Shit happens.

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:39.000
All right.

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:41.000
Misty do you have FUs of the week?

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:51.000
Kind of. It's just mostly to work drama and bullshit. I'm not even going to name specific names.

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:55.000
Also to the fact that I have not won the lottery so I can't move out here yet.

02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:58.000
FU to not winning the lottery. I can sign off.

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:00.000
Dan the man. Do you have some FUs?

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:03.000
I got to throw an FU out to the economy.

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:06.000
Believe it or not I miss having a job.

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:12.000
Having a job was actually a great way to break up your day.

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:13.000
And how.

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:17.000
And besides that no not too many.

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:19.000
FU to all who oppose me.

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:21.000
Fuck you.

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:23.000
I will fucking kill you.

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:25.000
Back at you.

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:27.000
Misty are you saying you oppose Dan?

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:28.000
Don't oppose me.

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:31.000
Uh oh. We might have a throw down.

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:35.000
Trust me between now and Friday I can make your life a living heck.

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:37.000
Alright.

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:38.000
Not compared to work.

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:41.000
Before we get back into the gaming news of which I have a story here.

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:43.000
News about gaming? That's amazing.

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:45.000
Soon we will get to the Skype line.

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:49.000
And then the callers call in and it just all goes wild from there.

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:52.000
Alright I want to ask Misty though.

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:55.000
What do you have planned for your week while you're here?

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:56.000
What are you going to do?

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:58.000
What stuff do you have to see?

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:03.000
Because I know when I think tourism I think Sacramento.

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:07.000
I think we should go to the zoo.

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:09.000
That would be nice.

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:13.000
But yeah mainly obligatory Arviggle time.

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:15.000
Sunrise for Para Para.

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:17.000
Feed Jamie to a giraffe if you go to the zoo.

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:19.000
No no no red pandas.

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:22.000
Why would I do that? Dan maybe but not Jamie.

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:27.000
Dan will get eaten by a Gru.

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:31.000
Since when do they keep Gru's at zoos?

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:33.000
Are you guys going to go to San Francisco?

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:37.000
If we get enough people to help me with gas and parking.

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:39.000
I think you guys will have fun.

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:41.000
Because like Dan said we're pretty broke but.

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:43.000
I don't know why your mic sucks but.

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:44.000
How about this okay.

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:45.000
Much better yes.

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:49.000
If I have assistance with parking and everything and we eat cheap.

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:52.000
And I don't completely blow my budget at Daiso.

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:56.000
Or at Ichibancon then we should be fine.

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:59.000
Sometimes you can find street parking it's just really rare.

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:04.000
The garage is fine because honestly if you eat at like one of the little restaurants in there.

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:05.000
They'll all validate.

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:06.000
Oh Japantown?

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:07.000
Yeah Japantown.

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:09.000
Because I figured except I really kind of.

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:12.000
Well except that one garage that I feel most secure going to.

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:15.000
Is also the most expensive in the Castro.

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:18.000
Because I totally want to go to Naya.

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:20.000
The gelato place.

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:22.000
You can go to Naya in Berkeley.

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:23.000
You should go to hot cookie.

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:24.000
You know what hot cookie is?

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:26.000
It's the cookie store they sell cookies and underwear.

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:27.000
And pantsu.

02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:29.000
They sell cookies and panties that's.

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:30.000
Yep.

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:31.000
Really it.

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:32.000
Can't we just hit yogurt.

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:36.000
Actually yogurt is right around the corner from my house.

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:37.000
Exactly.

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:38.000
I wish I could go with you gals but.

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:39.000
I have to work.

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:40.000
I don't have a lot of time.

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:43.000
If I want to go to gay days this year I have to keep working.

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:45.000
We'll get your man to entertain us.

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:46.000
Alright.

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:47.000
Anyhow back to gaming news then.

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:49.000
Let's get into this story about Xfire.

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:50.000
Do you guys remember Xfire?

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:53.000
Because I was using Xfire a couple years ago then I like stopped.

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:54.000
I do.

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:56.000
Steam kind of took its place for me.

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:59.000
But I guess there's still a lot of people using Xfire and Xfire is still around.

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:03.000
But Xfire got bought this week.

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:09.000
And they sent out a release to their 17 million users saying quote Xfire was bought by new owners today.

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:13.000
Most of the team that has built Xfire over the last six years is leaving.

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:18.000
We enjoyed working for you over the last 127 releases and wish we could stay to create the next 127.

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:20.000
Good luck and.

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:21.000
I'm sorry goodbye.

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:22.000
Good luck and game on.

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:27.000
That's kind of a thinly veiled like we just got bought and all laid off.

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:28.000
That's kind of sad actually.

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:30.000
Why did they get bought?

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:34.000
Well they were bought by Titan Gaming and they're based out of Los Angeles.

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:38.000
They have what's called skill based gaming technology.

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:41.000
Read that as money competitive gaming.

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:44.000
Titan will be taking on the Xfire name.

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:48.000
They're going to focus on ongoing innovation in the gaming space.

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:52.000
At least that's you know what the message says on their Titan website.

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:56.000
Quote the Xfire services will continue uninterrupted for its users.

02:05:56.000 --> 02:06:01.000
And it will help gaming companies better engage their users and monetize their games.

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:03.000
Interesting.

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:10.000
They're saying that this might be to try and position Titan Gaming to compete better with things like virgin gaming and so forth.

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:16.000
But I believe the sound you're going to hear right now is millions of users canceling their Xfire accounts that they haven't already.

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:20.000
I'm going to be honest. I haven't used Xfire since Steam came out.

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:22.000
I was like Xfire? Really?

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:23.000
I know.

02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:26.000
They got bought? Imagine that.

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:27.000
There it goes.

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:35.000
Tigerclaws says if you go to Xfire.com you can watch a bunch of live streams of people playing on it and it's mostly wow. Really?

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:37.000
Man that's just what I want to see.

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:42.000
Well let's go to Xfire.com right now and watch some a-holes play some wow.

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:44.000
Let's see we're going to go to Xfire.com.

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:46.000
To do live radio. I love this.

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:51.000
Actually you know what? We need some theme music as we go to Xfire.com that was recently purchased by Titan.

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:56.000
Benny Hill.

02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:58.000
This song works for practically everything.

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:01.000
Videos. Live videos.

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:02.000
Let's see here.

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:05.000
There's Starcraft 2 going on live.

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:07.000
Worst rogue priest in USA.

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:09.000
That doesn't even make sense.

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:10.000
How does that work?

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:12.000
There's some people doing arenas.

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:15.000
Yeah these are like all wow videos.

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:22.000
I want to see worst rogue priest in the USA.

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:24.000
Where is it?

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:28.000
I clicked on it and nothing happened.

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:30.000
This is the worst segment ever.

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:32.000
Rob is fail at the internet.

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:36.000
Clearly. Oh I clicked on the wrong link. This website sucks.

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:38.000
Xfire live video.

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:41.000
So now you're blaming the website.

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:43.000
We're going to snoop in you guys.

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:48.000
Cyclone.

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:51.000
Cyclone.

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:52.000
Roots.

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:57.000
I'm casting cyclone. I'm casting roots.

02:07:57.000 --> 02:07:58.000
Needs more magic music.

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:03.000
I got blind and uh.

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:04.000
I'm getting drunk.

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:07.000
I fucking just fell asleep right there in that little piece.

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:12.000
I mean how much did they sell this website for? 40 bucks? Because that's about what it's worth.

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:15.000
It's 20 more than I would have paid.

02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:17.000
Although I've got to say.

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:21.000
Couldn't we just do our show on Xfire?

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:23.000
There might be more.

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:29.000
We could go on there and uh you know go on uh and do like a live wow stream and be all like hi you're listening to orange on video.

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:32.000
Cyclone. Cyclone.

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:34.000
Roots.

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:36.000
And cyclone.

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:38.000
Magic missile.

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:41.000
I'm going to use intimidating shout.

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:43.000
That really is a wow move actually.

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:46.000
I know.

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:49.000
Dan only knows that from watching South Park.

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:51.000
Alright.

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:55.000
No no see I didn't work in a video game store for 10 years or nothing.

02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:57.000
People might talk about Warcraft there.

02:08:57.000 --> 02:09:02.000
In fact I banned my assistant manager from talking about Warcraft.

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:06.000
He'd talk about Warcraft and I'd be like no I need you to do some work.

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:09.000
So if he came into work one day and started going cyclone.

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:12.000
You know what's amazing about that? That was live.

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:17.000
That wasn't planned. That was actually happening right now somewhere.

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:21.000
That just happened.

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:23.000
Anyhow.

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:28.000
One more story from Dark Sakura and one more from me and then we're going to open up the phone lines and if you thought cyclone was bad.

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:30.000
Alright. Dark Sakura.

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:33.000
Well Treasure actually.

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:37.000
They are wanting to work on another 3D shooting game.

02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:41.000
And if you have really good programming skills and live in Japan.

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:44.000
You actually might be able to make it.

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:49.000
They have a job listing on their website looking for a new project 3D action shooting game.

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:53.000
And they are advertising.

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:56.000
Dude we should send this actually to Krista.

02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:59.000
Have her work for Treshar.

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:02.000
I'm surprised you're not applying for this.

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:04.000
I can't program shit.

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:06.000
You can learn fast.

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:07.000
I'm going to link this to Krista.

02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:11.000
You could lie about your qualifications like in Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead.

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:15.000
That was great. Oh I see you graduated from Vassar.

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:17.000
I'm right on top of it Rose.

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:19.000
You know I saw that in the theater.

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:20.000
Me too.

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:22.000
The dishes are done man.

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:25.000
Why are we quoting a movie that's like 20 years old?

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:27.000
Because movies are awesome.

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:31.000
We have some listeners that weren't even born yet when that movie came out.

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:33.000
Fuck them.

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:35.000
It's on DVD.

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:37.000
Maybe.

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:40.000
Well they've put worse shit on DVD from what I hear.

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:42.000
I don't specifically know what but yeah.

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:43.000
Alright.

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:45.000
Let's talk Starcraft 2.

02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:46.000
And how.

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:53.000
And Dan you better be careful because you know this house is prone to getting these spy bots and these bad things in it.

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:56.000
And this is important to know about Starcraft 2.

02:10:56.000 --> 02:11:00.000
Actually this is actually halfway serious because there are a lot of phishing scams out there.

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:03.000
And I'm not talking about like phishing like you know.

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:05.000
Reel her in.

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:07.000
I'm talking phishing like P.H.

02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:08.000
Wow.

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:09.000
I'm not like talking Dreamcast phishing.

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:11.000
The great thing is he's looking right at me.

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:12.000
I know.

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:13.000
And he's saying that like I'm not going to understand.

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:14.000
You need to understand.

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:15.000
No Dan.

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:16.000
Dan.

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:17.000
Why aren't you looking at.

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:18.000
Listen to the words.

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:20.000
Why aren't you looking at DarkSakura over there.

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:31.000
This spy bot search and destroy herself who's downloaded 15 viruses in the time that we've watched the show and managed to managed to kill them all.

02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:34.000
Then she's looking at me like she's hurt.

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:39.000
She dumped like a gallon of bleach hypothetically into her computer to clean up any possible viruses.

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:40.000
See that's what I'm saying.

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:42.000
Yeah and you want to know exactly how it got rid of it actually.

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:46.000
I finally ended up doing a Windows search finding the DLLs and deleting them.

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:47.000
See.

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:49.000
And what was the DLL called?

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:50.000
Fuck if I can remember.

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:51.000
There's also a few EXEs attached to it.

02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:52.000
But I got rid of them.

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:53.000
I thought it was called STD.

02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:57.000
No the STD one was one that was among the list of those.

02:11:57.000 --> 02:12:00.000
But the things that I have are from like last year.

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:01.000
All the instructions.

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:03.000
And the program has changed since.

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:04.000
So they've renamed all the stuff.

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:06.000
So I had to go back and find them.

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:08.000
But I took care of it.

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:11.000
It's like a Pokemon but STD.

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:25.000
And it was also actually every time I would stop the process it would restart the process through a different database builder that I had built in.

02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:29.000
So I actually had to delete the database builder and the program.

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:31.000
It's like Skynet yo.

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:34.000
Did your computer become self aware?

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:36.000
It touches itself Rob.

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:37.000
Alright.

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:39.000
Can I move on talking about Starcraft 2 here?

02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:40.000
It sure is aware of itself.

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:41.000
If you must.

02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:47.000
Be wary because there are a lot of phishing emails going out there about certain Starcraft 2 promotions.

02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:54.000
For example if there's an email that you get about new free maps or a new mount for Warcraft.

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:55.000
I guess this kind of crosses over.

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:58.000
Or you know any type of extra Starcraft 2 stuff.

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:05.000
They're trying to get your battle.net account info to try and get your activation key for the game.

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:08.000
So be careful there's a lot of phishing emails out there.

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:11.000
Obviously it's been going on in World of Warcraft 4 forever.

02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:16.000
Unfortunately Blizzard hasn't really been able to fight it outside of the authenticator.

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:20.000
Which is a little silly that they've had to release this authenticator to protect accounts.

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:23.000
I mean but unfortunately they're just so prone to getting hacked.

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:24.000
I mean my own account was hacked.

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:26.000
I mentioned earlier in the show.

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:28.000
You know last year and it sucked.

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:31.000
It was kind of like virtual rape.

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:33.000
Like it was just my character.

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:35.000
Somebody played my character.

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:37.000
Played with my character when I didn't know.

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:39.000
It's just very sad.

02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:42.000
What's ridiculous is it's the class of cybercriminal.

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:45.000
You know they're just doing it to fuck with people.

02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:48.000
Because I mean really why wouldn't you just steal their bank account number.

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:52.000
Or you know something where you could actually steal some money.

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:54.000
Well a lot of times they do that too.

02:13:54.000 --> 02:14:01.000
In fact there actually is a big login message in World of Warcraft now that says don't use the same password for Warcraft that you do any other website.

02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:04.000
Because if they get your password for Warcraft they'll get your other passwords too.

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:08.000
Why is that funny?

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:12.000
Because I could just see some guy putting in his password which is undoubtedly password.

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:20.000
For his bank account and his World of Warcraft and his you know everything.

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:24.000
And then being like oh my god I lost all my money.

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:29.000
Oh but the real tragedy is they cleaned out my Warcraft character.

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:31.000
You deserve it.

02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:36.000
Nobody deserves to have their Warcraft character raped.

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:38.000
I'm sorry Rob.

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:40.000
I know that hit a little too close.

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:42.000
Well there may be a few people.

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:46.000
Yes Monty Boggs in our chat room says did he touch your character in the swimsuit area.

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:48.000
And I play a Tauren for heaven's sake.

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:51.000
Yes he did touch the Tauren in the swimsuit area.

02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:54.000
That's how desperate these people are.

02:14:54.000 --> 02:15:00.000
Alright Frisbee in our chat room says password 12345 to which Bonds006 says dammit now I have to go change my password.

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:05.000
That's the same password I have on my luggage.

02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:14.000
The great thing is I read somewhere in this last week that they're cracking down on people who are having relations in World of Warcraft now.

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:16.000
Why can't they go after these companies?

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:20.000
Like I realize they're in another country or whatever but isn't Blizzard established in a lot of these other countries?

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:22.000
Why don't they go after these guys legally?

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:24.000
I mean it's a bad thing that they're doing.

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:28.000
Well wait wait wait they have roleplay servers for a reason.

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:30.000
Yeah well apparently they don't care.

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:35.000
Because some 10 year old went wandering on into one of those roleplay servers I guess.

02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:39.000
Yes in a completely unrelated type of story although I think that's what you're referring to.

02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:46.000
Blizzard actually announced this week kind of unofficially on the forums they were going to patrol one of the servers a little more because of the roleplay.

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:55.000
This server is kind of known for being the adult roleplay server and people like to roleplay in the tavern in Goldshire.

02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:56.000
Right that's what I read.

02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:58.000
And I can't remember the name of the server.

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:00.000
You're in the tavern getting drunk.

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:05.000
If there's any girls there I want to do them.

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:11.000
But what's amazing about RP servers is that there's just as many griefers as there are actual RPers.

02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:14.000
So you can just imagine what these servers look like some days.

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:16.000
You know that almost makes me want to play Warcraft.

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:18.000
You just want to be a griefer.

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:19.000
Oh yes.

02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:21.000
Oh no you want to do adult RP.

02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:22.000
Admit it Dan.

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:24.000
I can do adult RP at home.

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:25.000
Trust me bitch.

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:26.000
Oh really now.

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:27.000
Being an adult sucks.

02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:28.000
I'd rather do 10 year old RP.

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:30.000
They'd be like why is your character sitting there on the ground.

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:32.000
I'm playing with GI Joes.

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:33.000
It's amazing.

02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:36.000
Lance of Longinus.

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:42.000
If you want to give us a call 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:44.000
The Skype line is open.

02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:48.000
1-877-GAME-OLR or OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype.

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:50.000
Call and harass Dan for me.

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:52.000
Game-olar.

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:54.000
We should have a segment called Make Dan Laugh.

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:55.000
Haha.

02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:56.000
Alright.

02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:58.000
That's not that hard.

02:16:58.000 --> 02:16:59.000
Let's see.

02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:00.000
I'm known as Chuckles.

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:04.000
Yeah SalaciousPop in our chat is following up with the details of the story there.

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:07.000
There is one particular roleplay server that has been earmarked for erotic chat.

02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:09.000
Apparently it gets pretty explicit.

02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:10.000
Dude I want to play there.

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:11.000
I love the word erotic.

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:14.000
All level 5 toons in the human side starter in.

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:21.000
Tigerclaw says speaking of Starcraft you have the story about Blizzard removing Starcraft 2 maps due to inappropriate content right?

02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:25.000
I did hear about that. All the wang maps and penis looking maps and you know.

02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:28.000
Quit making maps that look suggestive.

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:30.000
Attack your balls.

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:31.000
Alright.

02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:35.000
Hahahaha.

02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:37.000
You have to defend your zone.

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:39.000
Haven't you heard like.

02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:41.000
Let's be honest. If the Zerg attacked your groin.

02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:51.000
Starcraft 2 apparently has these crazy like as modes where like you can like make RP games and like.

02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:53.000
Ooo erotic roleplay in Starcraft.

02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:54.000
Coming soon.

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:55.000
Jesus.

02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:57.000
Yes my child.

02:17:57.000 --> 02:17:59.000
Your soldiers are all really tiny.

02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:00.000
Let's go to the phones.

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:01.000
I just don't see how that would be exciting.

02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:03.000
Hi you're on OrangeLion's radio. Who's this?

02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:05.000
Yo.

02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:06.000
Yo.

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:07.000
Yo.

02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:08.000
What up?

02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:14.000
Hello there O.L.R. Speaking of which. Speaking of Swede. If it's that one. Swede.

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:15.000
Ahem.

02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:18.000
It's our crazy Swede Aki Ripper is calling in.

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:20.000
Jesus heck is this.

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:21.000
Oh shut up.

02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:23.000
He's one of our official Swedes.

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:25.000
Dan we have listeners all over the world.

02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:27.000
Oh he's. This is real.

02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:28.000
Yes this is a real guy.

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:29.000
Yeah well.

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:31.000
I thought that guy was just putting on a voice.

02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:33.000
No he's really. Well at least as far as we know.

02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:35.000
I'm pretty impressed now actually.

02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:39.000
No no no no. Dan I am from Sweden.

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:44.000
Oh well that's a really bad example but well.

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:46.000
He just went off on you in Swedish.

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:47.000
How is the chef?

02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:49.000
That was hot.

02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:52.000
I have a question about Sweden I want to know.

02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:54.000
I have to know this.

02:18:54.000 --> 02:19:00.000
Okay so in Sweden do you guys call Swedish fish just fish?

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:01.000
No we don't.

02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:04.000
Because they're delicious and they're red.

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:06.000
We don't fish.

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:10.000
Well some of us do but it's like dying out.

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:12.000
He said some of us do. Thank you.

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:14.000
I'm glad that you confirmed that for me.

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:18.000
But on the subject of fish though.

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:20.000
Yes I will.

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:28.000
Because I live in that part of Sweden where you know the thing where rotten fish is supposedly popular.

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:33.000
Oh wait but it isn't rotten it's just like fermented beyond fermented.

02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:39.000
And yeah so called soothed minted.

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:42.000
So do you guys like eat them or do you just smell them?

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:47.000
Anyway what did you call in for tonight?

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:48.000
What's the point?

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:50.000
Dan stop egging him on.

02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:53.000
Dan Aki Ripper what did you call in to talk about tonight?

02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:55.000
That's what I said.

02:19:55.000 --> 02:20:06.000
Well Blizzard still won't let me play Starcraft 2 but here goes the thing though.

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:15.000
I tried to call their customer service two times and it was all busy.

02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:22.000
And I was like screw this I'm going to start playing Sims 3.

02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:24.000
Can you play Starcraft 1?

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:39.000
And speaking of Sims 3 there has been like a few talks well in a recent tweet thing about the coming expansion.

02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:43.000
Sims late night or what is it no.

02:20:43.000 --> 02:20:48.000
Yeah Sims 3 late night the latest expansion or whatever.

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:51.000
Is this with erotic roleplay as well?

02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:54.000
Sims late night sounds kind of kinky.

02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:55.000
Isn't that why they killed Sims Online?

02:20:55.000 --> 02:21:00.000
Yeah Sims Online turned into just it was so sinful what was going on.

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:01.000
Exactly.

02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:02.000
Sims Online.

02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:04.000
And that's what the Sims always comes into.

02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:08.000
Everyone who plays Sims is a pervo.

02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:11.000
Dan shut up I played Sims.

02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:17.000
Hold on hold on Aki Ripper I want to rewind a little bit because you're still mad at Blizzard and rightfully so.

02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:20.000
But I have some ideas for you on how to take your revenge on Blizzard.

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:27.000
And one of them you just brought up this stanky rotten fish thing you need to send Blizzard a can of that.

02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:32.000
So is it like you can't play any Blizzard games can you play Starcraft 1 for example?

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:34.000
I don't think it will help in a kind of way.

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:46.000
And well one kind of thing that pisses me a bit off is that well while I have apparently some way on getting that authenticator.

02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:53.000
My current cell phone that I use don't support the authenticator unfortunately.

02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:56.000
Can you get the little physical one?

02:21:56.000 --> 02:21:58.000
What time is it in Sweden?

02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:00.000
It's three thirty in the morning.

02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:03.000
You talked about the Blizzard authenticator.

02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:05.000
Yeah the actual one not the mobile one.

02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:10.000
Which is available to some cell phones.

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:20.000
My problem is that the current cell phone that I'm using at the moment I can't use that because it's not a symbian cell phone.

02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:25.000
I can remember they sell a stand alone one that's not just for cell phones.

02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:27.000
It's like you push a little button on it.

02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:29.000
Alan has one and I used to have one a couple years ago.

02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:32.000
It's like a physical authenticator you don't need a mobile phone for it.

02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:40.000
Which is good because I will most likely order that one instead of the one on a cell phone.

02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:42.000
AK Ripper we got to let you go to get more calls.

02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:44.000
Everybody was trying to get through to talk to Dan tonight.

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:46.000
But thank you very much.

02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:47.000
Take care.

02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:49.000
Anyway once again for all.

02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:52.000
Your show rocks beyond the den.

02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:54.000
I love you AK Ripper.

02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:55.000
By the way one other suggestion.

02:22:55.000 --> 02:23:02.000
Actually tonight since actually Dan and well Misty and all those guesses was quite fun.

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:05.000
If you want to make Blizzard really upset.

02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:07.000
Threaten to take away Ikea.

02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:09.000
Right.

02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:11.000
Swedish people will.

02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:15.000
AK Ripper you take care buddy.

02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:17.000
Good luck with your Blizzard drama.

02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:18.000
Bye.

02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:22.000
Dude why do you think I've been listening for practically 300 episodes now?

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:23.000
Good time.

02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:26.000
Hey you see that's what we should do tomorrow is go to Ikea.

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:27.000
Ikea?

02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:29.000
You should go have meatballs.

02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:31.000
We're going to Ikea for lunch.

02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:32.000
I'm not.

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:34.000
We got a call coming in.

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:35.000
Hey behave.

02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:37.000
Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio who's this?

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:38.000
Behave.

02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:39.000
This.

02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:41.000
Well this is.

02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:43.000
If you're from Sweden we're hanging out.

02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:44.000
Oh I can't understand.

02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:45.000
Dan.

02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:46.000
Shush.

02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:47.000
Just for a minute.

02:23:47.000 --> 02:23:49.000
You sit there and you shush.

02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:50.000
Okay.

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:51.000
Okay sorry caller.

02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:52.000
I'm sorry.

02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:53.000
Hi Blaisekin.

02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:55.000
Okay hi Blaisekin how are you?

02:23:55.000 --> 02:24:04.000
I'm doing fine and actually I'm kind of excited about the 3DS but not as much as if there

02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:08.000
were Beatmania or DJ Max coming to the PS3.

02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:09.000
Wait hold on.

02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:11.000
I got a real quick question for you.

02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:13.000
Where are you from?

02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:16.000
I'm straight out of Omaha, Nebraska.

02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:21.000
Stuck here in the middle of the United States of America with the best music arcade in America.

02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:22.000
Okay wait.

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:23.000
Hold on.

02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:24.000
Hold that thought for a minute.

02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:25.000
Dan.

02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:26.000
He's from Omaha, Nebraska.

02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:27.000
That's not Sweden.

02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:28.000
That's not Sweden.

02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:30.000
I don't even think they have Ikea in Nebraska.

02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:31.000
Nebraska almost worse.

02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:32.000
Alright.

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:33.000
Shush.

02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:34.000
Almost worse.

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:35.000
I haven't been to Nebraska yet.

02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:38.000
Keep in mind I'm going to be smacking him like a red-headed stepchild later.

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:39.000
Alright.

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:40.000
Can I help?

02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:41.000
The 3DS.

02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:46.000
Now you do know there is DJ Hero on the 3DS but I don't know if you're a fan of that.

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:47.000
Actually do you know what?

02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:49.000
I made a sketch.

02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:54.000
About a few months ago while sitting in lunch at high school and trying to figure out because

02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:58.640
I kind of rumored you know how Guitar Hero came to the 3DS so I was kind of figuring

02:24:58.640 --> 02:25:04.100
out how the heck they're going to pull off DJ Hero on 3DS and my thing was like the same

02:25:04.100 --> 02:25:12.840
thing that they did for Guitar Hero but just put a miniature turntable into the GBA slot

02:25:12.840 --> 02:25:17.480
with the buttons on there and then have the cross fader on the touch screen.

02:25:17.480 --> 02:25:18.480
That's no GBA.

02:25:18.480 --> 02:25:19.480
That's my idea.

02:25:19.480 --> 02:25:20.480
That's no GBA.

02:25:20.480 --> 02:25:21.480
You're really close.

02:25:21.480 --> 02:25:23.920
The cross fader is on the touch screen so is the turntable.

02:25:23.920 --> 02:25:24.920
That's how they do it.

02:25:24.920 --> 02:25:25.920
Aww.

02:25:25.920 --> 02:25:26.920
What?

02:25:26.920 --> 02:25:28.400
There's no peripheral on the bottom.

02:25:28.400 --> 02:25:29.400
I didn't play it.

02:25:29.400 --> 02:25:34.040
I heard all this secondhand from Shane but seriously go listen to the E3 shows which

02:25:34.040 --> 02:25:36.520
are still on iTunes and on the website.

02:25:36.520 --> 02:25:37.520
Wednesday.

02:25:37.520 --> 02:25:38.520
Tuesday.

02:25:38.520 --> 02:25:39.520
No.

02:25:39.520 --> 02:25:40.520
Tuesday's E3 show.

02:25:40.520 --> 02:25:43.680
The first E3 show, whenever that was, we talked about DJ Hero on the 3DS because he actually

02:25:43.680 --> 02:25:44.680
played it.

02:25:44.680 --> 02:25:45.680
I missed it.

02:25:45.680 --> 02:25:50.160
He was playing Ridge Racer on the 3DS which sucks balls.

02:25:50.160 --> 02:25:51.160
Only balls?

02:25:51.160 --> 02:25:52.160
Yeah.

02:25:52.160 --> 02:26:00.040
Especially for steering unless you're using the little analog that they got on there.

02:26:00.040 --> 02:26:02.160
That's how I play on the PSP.

02:26:02.160 --> 02:26:06.920
I cannot stand on the touch screen too.

02:26:06.920 --> 02:26:08.120
The collision was so weird.

02:26:08.120 --> 02:26:12.040
When you run into your wall, the car would rotate like 15 degrees at a time.

02:26:12.040 --> 02:26:13.040
It wasn't very smooth.

02:26:13.040 --> 02:26:14.040
Oh.

02:26:14.040 --> 02:26:15.040
It is Ridge Racer.

02:26:15.040 --> 02:26:16.040
Anyway, wait.

02:26:16.040 --> 02:26:17.040
Hold on.

02:26:17.040 --> 02:26:18.040
This is the real question I want to ask.

02:26:18.040 --> 02:26:21.840
DJ Blazekin said he was drawing this out while he was in high school, kind of doodling it

02:26:21.840 --> 02:26:22.840
sounds like.

02:26:22.840 --> 02:26:23.840
Okay.

02:26:23.840 --> 02:26:27.960
I don't know about you but when I was of that age, in high school, in junior high and even

02:26:27.960 --> 02:26:31.080
grade school a little bit, you know what we used to draw when we were bored?

02:26:31.080 --> 02:26:35.680
We would draw out those little adventure games where you would draw your lair.

02:26:35.680 --> 02:26:37.120
Don't you remember this?

02:26:37.120 --> 02:26:38.360
Was this just me?

02:26:38.360 --> 02:26:44.880
You draw out the lair and there might be a pit full of alligators and a vine and things.

02:26:44.880 --> 02:26:52.600
It was basically a poor man's Dungeons and Dragons mixed with an 8-bit video game.

02:26:52.600 --> 02:27:00.760
We made many, many poor graph paper, six sided die, ghetto RPGs.

02:27:00.760 --> 02:27:03.760
And there would always be a woman with big boobies at the end of the maze that you were

02:27:03.760 --> 02:27:08.080
trying to get to.

02:27:08.080 --> 02:27:11.640
I don't know why I decided to talk about that but I did.

02:27:11.640 --> 02:27:15.400
I wanted to do it back in my day story.

02:27:15.400 --> 02:27:16.400
Okay.

02:27:16.400 --> 02:27:23.720
You know how the new DJ Max Technical, which I haven't played yet, but the only thing near

02:27:23.720 --> 02:27:34.400
to that we even have here in Omaha is DJ, or not DJ Max, BeatMania 13 Distorted is

02:27:34.400 --> 02:27:35.680
what we got over here.

02:27:35.680 --> 02:27:40.080
And I'll tell you this straight up, the Family Fun Center is what it's called over here.

02:27:40.080 --> 02:27:44.080
They've kept a majority of their music games up and running like perfect health.

02:27:44.080 --> 02:27:51.000
Now, I've got to give a giant F you to my local malls arcade because one of my favorite

02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:56.000
games down there, a music game in particular, In the Groove, which I play frequently when

02:27:56.000 --> 02:27:57.000
I go there.

02:27:57.000 --> 02:28:00.640
Well, my mom's getting her nails done and whatnot.

02:28:00.640 --> 02:28:02.640
That is one way to kill time.

02:28:02.640 --> 02:28:05.080
Basically, it's down.

02:28:05.080 --> 02:28:09.700
And the game's been out of commission for more than a month.

02:28:09.700 --> 02:28:11.600
How long do you...

02:28:11.600 --> 02:28:15.200
Do you ever go to the nail salon and inhale the fumes in there before you go play In the

02:28:15.200 --> 02:28:16.200
Groove?

02:28:16.200 --> 02:28:17.200
No.

02:28:17.200 --> 02:28:18.200
I know.

02:28:18.200 --> 02:28:19.200
It really, really improves the experience.

02:28:19.200 --> 02:28:20.840
I was going to say, maybe that's what makes the game fun.

02:28:20.840 --> 02:28:21.840
I'm just kidding.

02:28:21.840 --> 02:28:22.840
No.

02:28:22.840 --> 02:28:23.840
No, no, no, no, no.

02:28:23.840 --> 02:28:28.560
But I usually have my own little USB flash drive with my custom songs on it to play on

02:28:28.560 --> 02:28:31.120
it, which I have all the DDR soundtrack songs.

02:28:31.120 --> 02:28:33.060
Oh, well that's cool, yeah.

02:28:33.060 --> 02:28:36.840
That was pretty cool when they opened it up on that last patch to all the USB stuff.

02:28:36.840 --> 02:28:37.840
That was neat.

02:28:37.840 --> 02:28:38.840
I'll give you that.

02:28:38.840 --> 02:28:43.320
Yeah, and here's the thing.

02:28:43.320 --> 02:28:46.320
I'm actually visually impaired in one eye myself.

02:28:46.320 --> 02:28:49.800
Black Wolf is not the only one that has a vision problem.

02:28:49.800 --> 02:28:53.720
I'm kind of ultimately at the same point, because I can only see well in one eye.

02:28:53.720 --> 02:28:58.200
Well, I can think of two listeners we have at least that have both eyes blind.

02:28:58.200 --> 02:29:01.800
Didn't In the Groove get sued out of existence?

02:29:01.800 --> 02:29:03.440
Yeah, it got sued.

02:29:03.440 --> 02:29:06.600
It got annihilated by judgments, basically.

02:29:06.600 --> 02:29:09.080
It was sued out of commission.

02:29:09.080 --> 02:29:11.280
But that's a whole nother show.

02:29:11.280 --> 02:29:16.640
In the Groove though, like players and DDRs, one, you didn't have a bunch of friggin background

02:29:16.640 --> 02:29:23.720
videos going on with flashing arrows, which it's just like solid color arrows, no background

02:29:23.720 --> 02:29:24.720
video.

02:29:24.720 --> 02:29:26.920
It's way easier to see.

02:29:26.920 --> 02:29:33.240
And even completely 2020 sighted players I've talked to say that it's better and easier

02:29:33.240 --> 02:29:37.040
to play it in DDR for getting the notes.

02:29:37.040 --> 02:29:38.040
Awesome.

02:29:38.040 --> 02:29:39.040
All right.

02:29:39.040 --> 02:29:41.840
We're going to let you go, dude, because we've got to get more calls.

02:29:41.840 --> 02:29:44.200
But I got one last question for you guys.

02:29:44.200 --> 02:29:45.200
Make it quick.

02:29:45.200 --> 02:29:46.200
Make it quick.

02:29:46.200 --> 02:29:50.000
Do you think there's a possibility of DJ Max Technica on the DS?

02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:53.560
I wouldn't hold my breath.

02:29:53.560 --> 02:29:55.320
Anything is possible.

02:29:55.320 --> 02:29:58.280
It's always about sales and how much those dev kits are going to cost.

02:29:58.280 --> 02:30:01.840
I wouldn't expect it for at least a year because those dev kits are going to have to come down

02:30:01.840 --> 02:30:02.840
in price a little bit.

02:30:02.840 --> 02:30:04.240
So don't get your hopes up for right away.

02:30:04.240 --> 02:30:07.080
All you got for right now is DJ Hero.

02:30:07.080 --> 02:30:10.400
And if you're lucky, somebody will come up with another innovative music game.

02:30:10.400 --> 02:30:16.840
Let's not forget the DS is what gave us Elite Beat Agents, which is basically DJ Max Technica.

02:30:16.840 --> 02:30:18.800
I mean, right?

02:30:18.800 --> 02:30:25.400
So I've never played Technica in the States and is now on sale with accessories for $9.99.

02:30:25.400 --> 02:30:26.400
It has Flee.

02:30:26.400 --> 02:30:27.400
That's a kickass song.

02:30:27.400 --> 02:30:28.400
All right, buddy.

02:30:28.400 --> 02:30:29.400
We're gonna let you go to get more calls.

02:30:29.400 --> 02:30:30.400
You take care.

02:30:30.400 --> 02:30:31.400
Have a good one.

02:30:31.400 --> 02:30:32.400
Peace out.

02:30:32.400 --> 02:30:33.400
Bye.

02:30:33.400 --> 02:30:34.400
Bye.

02:30:34.400 --> 02:30:35.400
Okay.

02:30:35.400 --> 02:30:36.400
Let's go to another call.

02:30:36.400 --> 02:30:37.400
Hello.

02:30:37.400 --> 02:30:38.400
You're on Orange Lawn's radio.

02:30:38.400 --> 02:30:39.400
Who's this?

02:30:39.400 --> 02:30:40.400
Hey, this is X-Link.

02:30:40.400 --> 02:30:41.400
Hi, X-Link.

02:30:41.400 --> 02:30:42.400
Hi.

02:30:42.400 --> 02:30:43.400
How are you?

02:30:43.400 --> 02:30:44.400
Hey.

02:30:44.400 --> 02:30:45.400
Doing good.

02:30:45.400 --> 02:30:46.400
Awesome.

02:30:46.400 --> 02:30:47.400
What's on your mind?

02:30:47.400 --> 02:30:48.400
You know, it made me laugh when you're talking about the erotic chat.

02:30:48.400 --> 02:30:49.400
And wow, it made me think of some of the stuff that some of the chats we have late at night

02:30:49.400 --> 02:30:50.400
here on the guild.

02:30:50.400 --> 02:30:51.400
Wow.

02:30:51.400 --> 02:30:52.400
No, no.

02:30:52.400 --> 02:30:53.400
No, no.

02:30:53.400 --> 02:30:54.400
Hold up.

02:30:54.400 --> 02:30:55.400
Ryan and I are in the same guild.

02:30:55.400 --> 02:30:56.400
Yeah.

02:30:56.400 --> 02:30:57.400
I picked that up real quick.

02:30:57.400 --> 02:30:58.400
No, no, no.

02:30:58.400 --> 02:30:59.400
They're dick and fart jokes.

02:30:59.400 --> 02:31:00.400
They're not anything actually.

02:31:00.400 --> 02:31:01.400
Yeah, whatever.

02:31:01.400 --> 02:31:02.720
But the whole team is in the guild as well.

02:31:02.720 --> 02:31:05.400
It only gets more and more kinky.

02:31:05.400 --> 02:31:07.320
Let me guess.

02:31:07.320 --> 02:31:09.360
Jamie's in there too, huh?

02:31:09.360 --> 02:31:11.240
She was for like a day.

02:31:11.240 --> 02:31:12.440
Everybody's been on this but me.

02:31:12.440 --> 02:31:14.040
No, Rob, I got to level 20.

02:31:14.040 --> 02:31:17.000
Why do I miss all the hot erotic chat?

02:31:17.000 --> 02:31:18.000
You're on...

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:19.000
Oh, don't worry, Dan.

02:31:19.000 --> 02:31:20.000
It's your like.

02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:21.000
I also need a transcript.

02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:22.000
Dan, you are unemployed.

02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:23.340
Now is the perfect time to play WoW.

02:31:23.340 --> 02:31:24.340
Exactly.

02:31:24.340 --> 02:31:26.880
You're like the fourth person to that.

02:31:26.880 --> 02:31:27.880
Rob, Rob, Rob.

02:31:27.880 --> 02:31:28.880
What?

02:31:28.880 --> 02:31:30.740
Dan lives with me, so he's going to be playing Star Trek online.

02:31:30.740 --> 02:31:32.740
Oh sh...

02:31:32.740 --> 02:31:34.740
Lock yourself in your room.

02:31:34.740 --> 02:31:35.740
Get a laptop.

02:31:35.740 --> 02:31:37.740
See this wallpaper?

02:31:37.740 --> 02:31:38.740
Deep Space Nine.

02:31:38.740 --> 02:31:40.740
I know. Star Trek Online.

02:31:40.740 --> 02:31:41.740
It's okay.

02:31:41.740 --> 02:31:42.740
You know what's terrible?

02:31:42.740 --> 02:31:44.740
When I was a teenager, I was a Trekkie.

02:31:44.740 --> 02:31:46.740
I mean hardcore.

02:31:46.740 --> 02:31:48.740
The posters, the movies, you know,

02:31:48.740 --> 02:31:50.740
knowing Klingon, the whole works.

02:31:50.740 --> 02:31:52.740
It was a show.

02:31:52.740 --> 02:31:54.740
It was the show on television.

02:31:54.740 --> 02:31:56.740
Yeah. Well now, my wife,

02:31:56.740 --> 02:31:58.740
ten years too late,

02:31:58.740 --> 02:32:00.740
has decided that she's going to be a Trekkie.

02:32:00.740 --> 02:32:01.740
No, no, no, no, no.

02:32:01.740 --> 02:32:03.740
That would have worked out for me, you know,

02:32:03.740 --> 02:32:04.740
years ago.

02:32:04.740 --> 02:32:06.740
Now it's just like, really?

02:32:06.740 --> 02:32:08.740
Star Trek? That's cute.

02:32:08.740 --> 02:32:09.740
No, no, no, no.

02:32:09.740 --> 02:32:11.740
Although admittedly I do kind of want some con cologne.

02:32:11.740 --> 02:32:13.740
Did you take her to the tour that's at Mather?

02:32:13.740 --> 02:32:14.740
No, we stopped to go.

02:32:14.740 --> 02:32:15.740
I do want to go too.

02:32:15.740 --> 02:32:16.740
I want to go too.

02:32:16.740 --> 02:32:17.740
Keep in mind...

02:32:17.740 --> 02:32:19.740
Keep in mind, I missed Deep Space Nine

02:32:19.740 --> 02:32:21.740
when it was on TV.

02:32:21.740 --> 02:32:23.740
I watched a few episodes here and there,

02:32:23.740 --> 02:32:25.740
but I was also in school.

02:32:25.740 --> 02:32:27.740
I had college to do.

02:32:27.740 --> 02:32:29.740
So her and her friends come over

02:32:29.740 --> 02:32:31.740
and they take over my big screen TV and my surround system

02:32:31.740 --> 02:32:33.740
and they sit on my couch

02:32:33.740 --> 02:32:35.740
and they watch Deep Space Nine on my big screen TV.

02:32:35.740 --> 02:32:36.740
How is that a problem?

02:32:36.740 --> 02:32:38.740
It's not a problem.

02:32:38.740 --> 02:32:39.740
But all I'm saying is,

02:32:39.740 --> 02:32:42.740
man, what happened when I would have enjoyed that?

02:32:42.740 --> 02:32:44.740
Star Trek Online though, admittedly,

02:32:44.740 --> 02:32:46.740
looks like a pretty neat game.

02:32:46.740 --> 02:32:47.740
Okay, back to the caller.

02:32:47.740 --> 02:32:48.740
Hi, caller.

02:32:48.740 --> 02:32:49.740
Hi.

02:32:49.740 --> 02:32:54.740
Anyway, so about those erotic chats, huh?

02:32:54.740 --> 02:32:56.740
Yep, he does.

02:32:56.740 --> 02:32:58.740
What did you call in to ask us about tonight?

02:32:58.740 --> 02:33:00.740
He just wanted to remind you that you

02:33:00.740 --> 02:33:01.740
erotically chat, Rob.

02:33:01.740 --> 02:33:02.740
Oh, sorry.

02:33:02.740 --> 02:33:04.740
He just wanted to bring up those late night chats

02:33:04.740 --> 02:33:05.740
live on air.

02:33:05.740 --> 02:33:06.740
I see how it is.

02:33:06.740 --> 02:33:07.740
That's fine.

02:33:07.740 --> 02:33:08.740
How dare you.

02:33:08.740 --> 02:33:09.740
Let me read some of these transcripts.

02:33:09.740 --> 02:33:10.740
All right.

02:33:10.740 --> 02:33:11.740
No, seriously, let the man talk.

02:33:11.740 --> 02:33:12.740
What's up?

02:33:12.740 --> 02:33:15.740
No, I wanted to talk about the...

02:33:15.740 --> 02:33:17.740
God, now I can't even think.

02:33:17.740 --> 02:33:19.740
Now I got all derailed by the whole chat thing.

02:33:19.740 --> 02:33:21.740
Yeah, welcome to my life tonight.

02:33:21.740 --> 02:33:22.740
Welcome to OLR.

02:33:22.740 --> 02:33:23.740
Jamie was like,

02:33:23.740 --> 02:33:25.740
hey, Dan should host the show while Loki's gone.

02:33:25.740 --> 02:33:26.740
I'm like, oh, sure.

02:33:26.740 --> 02:33:28.740
That sounds like a great idea.

02:33:28.740 --> 02:33:30.740
I think Dan's doing a great job.

02:33:30.740 --> 02:33:31.740
Oh, no.

02:33:31.740 --> 02:33:32.740
Dan's been fun.

02:33:32.740 --> 02:33:33.740
Dan's fun.

02:33:33.740 --> 02:33:34.740
Guess what?

02:33:34.740 --> 02:33:35.740
What?

02:33:35.740 --> 02:33:36.740
You get the hell out of my house.

02:33:36.740 --> 02:33:37.740
You can host your story.

02:33:37.740 --> 02:33:38.740
You can host it from your new car.

02:33:38.740 --> 02:33:39.740
I don't know.

02:33:39.740 --> 02:33:42.740
I think Rob could take you, Dan.

02:33:42.740 --> 02:33:43.740
Yeah.

02:33:43.740 --> 02:33:44.740
Dream on.

02:33:44.740 --> 02:33:45.740
I didn't say how.

02:33:45.740 --> 02:33:47.740
I just said I think you could.

02:33:47.740 --> 02:33:49.740
Look, I don't even want to go into that conversation.

02:33:49.740 --> 02:33:50.740
All right.

02:33:50.740 --> 02:33:51.740
X-Link, hi.

02:33:51.740 --> 02:33:52.740
This is getting inappropriate.

02:33:52.740 --> 02:33:53.740
Where every gamer has a voice.

02:33:53.740 --> 02:33:58.740
So anyways, how about those erotic chats?

02:33:58.740 --> 02:34:00.740
What about it?

02:34:00.740 --> 02:34:04.740
I believe you were going to ask something else until you were rudely derailed.

02:34:04.740 --> 02:34:06.740
Um, no.

02:34:06.740 --> 02:34:08.740
No, I can't think of what it is now.

02:34:08.740 --> 02:34:10.740
So I'm just going to leave it at that.

02:34:10.740 --> 02:34:11.740
All right.

02:34:11.740 --> 02:34:12.740
Well, have a great week, X-Link.

02:34:12.740 --> 02:34:13.740
Erotic chats.

02:34:13.740 --> 02:34:15.740
Thanks for the call, I think.

02:34:15.740 --> 02:34:16.740
All right.

02:34:16.740 --> 02:34:17.740
Have a good one.

02:34:17.740 --> 02:34:18.740
It was good to talk to you.

02:34:18.740 --> 02:34:20.740
You too.

02:34:20.740 --> 02:34:21.740
I enjoyed that.

02:34:21.740 --> 02:34:26.740
He sounded like a good guy.

02:34:26.740 --> 02:34:27.740
I hate this show.

02:34:27.740 --> 02:34:28.740
All right.

02:34:28.740 --> 02:34:29.740
1-8-7.

02:34:29.740 --> 02:34:30.740
You're loving it.

02:34:30.740 --> 02:34:31.740
I do love this show.

02:34:31.740 --> 02:34:32.740
You've got a big smile on your face.

02:34:32.740 --> 02:34:33.740
I do.

02:34:33.740 --> 02:34:34.740
This is fun.

02:34:34.740 --> 02:34:35.740
All right.

02:34:35.740 --> 02:34:36.740
1-8-7-7 game.

02:34:36.740 --> 02:34:37.740
O-L-R.

02:34:37.740 --> 02:34:38.740
username on Skype is orange.

02:34:38.740 --> 02:34:39.740
But see, now here's the thing, though.

02:34:39.740 --> 02:34:44.740
When Loki comes back, you guys, you have to say, oh, the show sucked when you weren't

02:34:44.740 --> 02:34:45.740
there.

02:34:45.740 --> 02:34:48.740
Like, it just wasn't working without you there.

02:34:48.740 --> 02:34:50.740
Because I don't want him to feel.

02:34:50.740 --> 02:34:51.740
You know what's weird, though?

02:34:51.740 --> 02:34:52.740
The show.

02:34:52.740 --> 02:34:53.740
He's probably listening to us.

02:34:53.740 --> 02:34:54.740
You know he's not coming back.

02:34:54.740 --> 02:34:57.740
The show is always better when one of us is missing.

02:34:57.740 --> 02:35:04.740
Like, you know Jamie missed episode 69, which was that epic night that Loki sang the karaoke

02:35:04.740 --> 02:35:06.740
revolution, and it's like one of our greatest movies ever.

02:35:06.740 --> 02:35:07.740
He sang I'm Staying In.

02:35:07.740 --> 02:35:08.740
And I was gone.

02:35:08.740 --> 02:35:09.740
Nice.

02:35:09.740 --> 02:35:13.740
I was gone one night, and this show just totally, like, I don't even know what happened.

02:35:13.740 --> 02:35:19.740
Like, they were watching a Ron Jeremy biography live on air and commenting on it.

02:35:19.740 --> 02:35:23.740
You wait until 378 when we pay all our mad libs.

02:35:23.740 --> 02:35:25.740
Wait, which episode is it?

02:35:25.740 --> 02:35:26.740
It will be epic.

02:35:26.740 --> 02:35:28.740
All right, can we take another call, please?

02:35:28.740 --> 02:35:29.740
No.

02:35:29.740 --> 02:35:30.740
Of course.

02:35:30.740 --> 02:35:31.740
Hi.

02:35:31.740 --> 02:35:32.740
Who said no?

02:35:32.740 --> 02:35:33.740
Misty.

02:35:33.740 --> 02:35:34.740
Misty's the new director.

02:35:34.740 --> 02:35:35.740
Veto.

02:35:35.740 --> 02:35:36.740
Producer.

02:35:36.740 --> 02:35:37.740
I'm taking the call.

02:35:37.740 --> 02:35:38.740
All right, I'm hanging up.

02:35:38.740 --> 02:35:39.740
No, I'm kidding.

02:35:39.740 --> 02:35:40.740
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio.

02:35:40.740 --> 02:35:41.740
Who's this?

02:35:41.740 --> 02:35:43.740
Hi, this is your friendly neighborhood Rick Roller spazzing eater.

02:35:43.740 --> 02:35:44.740
Hi, spazzing eater.

02:35:44.740 --> 02:35:45.740
It didn't work.

02:35:45.740 --> 02:35:46.740
I had the sound off.

02:35:46.740 --> 02:35:47.740
Haha.

02:35:47.740 --> 02:35:48.740
What's up?

02:35:48.740 --> 02:35:53.740
Well, after a couple of years of having that on, I know I kind of relate to the whole Rick

02:35:53.740 --> 02:35:56.740
Roller thing, but I figured you've got to do it at least once.

02:35:56.740 --> 02:36:01.740
But at any rate, two little tidbits of information.

02:36:01.740 --> 02:36:07.740
I probably wonder what you may already know about, but I can't figure you would like to

02:36:07.740 --> 02:36:11.740
know about since you're really big on the music-based games.

02:36:11.740 --> 02:36:22.740
From what I've heard through the grapevine, supposedly DDR is coming to both the 360 and

02:36:22.740 --> 02:36:25.740
PlayStation 3.

02:36:25.740 --> 02:36:35.740
I don't really follow DDR at all, so I don't know which version of DDR is coming to the

02:36:35.740 --> 02:36:44.740
other versions, but since I know the two of you are into DDR, I kind of figured the fact

02:36:44.740 --> 02:36:49.740
that it's coming out to newer systems may pique your interest.

02:36:49.740 --> 02:36:53.740
Sure, spazzing eater, actually, spazzing eater, I've got the perfect answer to your question

02:36:53.740 --> 02:36:57.740
actually because we actually have a friend that works at Konami that can actually answer

02:36:57.740 --> 02:37:02.740
this question and tell us some of the differences between the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3

02:37:02.740 --> 02:37:03.740
version.

02:37:03.740 --> 02:37:05.740
So let's head on over to my friend who's going to tell us.

02:37:05.740 --> 02:37:06.740
That's right, motherfucker.

02:37:06.740 --> 02:37:07.740
How's it feel?

02:37:07.740 --> 02:37:08.740
How's it feel?

02:37:08.740 --> 02:37:09.740
Oh, bitch!

02:37:09.740 --> 02:37:10.740
What?

02:37:10.740 --> 02:37:11.740
What?

02:37:11.740 --> 02:37:12.740
Who's Rick Wall and who now?

02:37:12.740 --> 02:37:13.740
He's no stranger to love.

02:37:13.740 --> 02:37:14.740
Yeah, that deserved a Pikachu beatdown.

02:37:14.740 --> 02:37:15.740
All right.

02:37:15.740 --> 02:37:16.740
I just got smacked with a Pikachu.

02:37:16.740 --> 02:37:17.740
All right.

02:37:17.740 --> 02:37:18.740
I've got troubles on my screen, Rob.

02:37:18.740 --> 02:37:19.740
Squeeze.

02:37:19.740 --> 02:37:20.740
Squeeze.

02:37:20.740 --> 02:37:21.740
Squeeze.

02:37:21.740 --> 02:37:22.740
Squeeze.

02:37:22.740 --> 02:37:23.740
Squeeze.

02:37:23.740 --> 02:37:24.740
Squeeze.

02:37:24.740 --> 02:37:25.740
Squeeze.

02:37:25.740 --> 02:37:26.740
Squeeze.

02:37:26.740 --> 02:37:27.740
Squeeze.

02:37:27.740 --> 02:37:28.740
Squeeze.

02:37:28.740 --> 02:37:29.740
Squeeze.

02:37:29.740 --> 02:37:30.740
Squeeze.

02:37:30.740 --> 02:37:31.740
Squeeze.

02:37:31.740 --> 02:37:33.740
I've got troubles on my screen, Rob.

02:37:33.740 --> 02:37:34.740
Squeeze.

02:37:34.740 --> 02:37:36.740
When Rob gets smacked with a Pikachu, he usually makes something else.

02:37:36.740 --> 02:37:37.740
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

02:37:37.740 --> 02:37:38.740
Where did you put Angus?

02:37:38.740 --> 02:37:40.740
What the hell are you talking about?

02:37:40.740 --> 02:37:41.740
Who's Angus?

02:37:41.740 --> 02:37:42.740
My trouble.

02:37:42.740 --> 02:37:43.740
It was in the blue bucket.

02:37:43.740 --> 02:37:45.740
Damn, don't tell me right away about another trouble.

02:37:45.740 --> 02:37:46.740
Hey, hold on.

02:37:46.740 --> 02:37:48.740
Angus is in the closet.

02:37:48.740 --> 02:37:49.740
Hold on.

02:37:49.740 --> 02:37:51.740
Spazinator actually had a question.

02:37:51.740 --> 02:37:53.740
I may or may not want to answer it.

02:37:53.740 --> 02:37:55.740
About what DDR version.

02:37:55.740 --> 02:37:56.740
Here's the thing, Spazinator.

02:37:56.740 --> 02:37:58.740
Actually, this is my honest answer.

02:37:58.740 --> 02:38:03.740
As far as these DDR games go, the new ones that are coming out, we don't know a lot about them, period.

02:38:03.740 --> 02:38:14.740
That's what makes this press event that's happening this week so interesting is because we had all this information about the Xbox and PlayStation DDRs coming out, and then suddenly there was nothing for a while.

02:38:14.740 --> 02:38:21.740
But I think what happened is that at E3, then we saw Dance Masters come out, and Dance Masters is a Xbox 360 game.

02:38:21.740 --> 02:38:28.740
So that the PlayStation 3 users have something, here is my guess, and I honestly believe this is the honest-to-God truth.

02:38:28.740 --> 02:38:36.740
The game that was going to come out on the 360 and PlayStation 3 now canceled on the 360 in favor of Dance Masters.

02:38:36.740 --> 02:38:42.740
But for those folks that don't have a 360, you get Dance Dance Revolution on the PlayStation 3.

02:38:42.740 --> 02:38:44.740
I honestly kind of think that's where things went.

02:38:44.740 --> 02:38:50.740
And it's really hard to say if this new PlayStation 3 game is going to be good or not until we know more about it.

02:38:50.740 --> 02:38:59.740
From what we heard a couple years ago, it's like a greatest hits, a lot of the famous songs and some new ones, lots of DLC, eight-panel dancing.

02:38:59.740 --> 02:39:07.740
It certainly makes it sound like it's going to be leaps and bounds better than the 360 games that already exist, because there is Universe 1, 2, and 3.

02:39:07.740 --> 02:39:17.740
But I think the PlayStation 3 one, you know, it's the first DDR game, I'm not even acknowledging the Wii ones because they're ridiculous, but it's the first real DDR game we've had in a couple years.

02:39:17.740 --> 02:39:23.740
And if they've actually rebuilt it from the ground up and so forth, it might be kind of cool. That's my thoughts.

02:39:23.740 --> 02:39:35.740
Yeah, as someone that's never touched a music game aside from some of the older Guitar Hero games and the Rock Band games, I'm willing to at least give it a try.

02:39:35.740 --> 02:39:45.740
Granted, I know it's hard core into that series as you guys are, but I'm willing to give anything a try, you know?

02:39:45.740 --> 02:39:57.740
Faznator, before you go buy DDR on the PlayStation 3, which will cost you at least $60, honestly, if you want to try it and see if you like it, you can find dance games on the PlayStation 1.

02:39:57.740 --> 02:40:00.740
Because I don't think you have a 360. Do you have a 360?

02:40:00.740 --> 02:40:01.740
Yeah, I do.

02:40:01.740 --> 02:40:07.740
Oh, okay, well then never mind. You can go buy a cheap dance pad for like no more than 20 bucks.

02:40:07.740 --> 02:40:11.740
And you could probably, like Dark Sakura found the fancy dance pads at a local discount store.

02:40:11.740 --> 02:40:12.740
I bought three of them for six bucks.

02:40:12.740 --> 02:40:19.740
Yeah, they're like super cheap. So if you look at like discount stores and stuff, you might find them even cheaper, but no more than 20 bucks for a cheap game pad.

02:40:19.740 --> 02:40:25.740
And like DDR Universe 2 at GameStop, I shit you not, I saw it in a bin the other day, $7 used.

02:40:25.740 --> 02:40:40.740
So I would say for 27 bucks, try it. And if you think the game is fun and you're like, hey, I want like a more souped up version of this, this is kind of fun, this is getting me moving and burning calories, then drop the 60 bucks on the PlayStation 3.

02:40:40.740 --> 02:40:46.740
But if you're not sure, Spaznator, don't spend more than 30 bucks doing the trial run.

02:40:46.740 --> 02:40:54.740
Because you're still getting a decent game out of it. It's not that the 360 games are bad, they're not. They're just, you know, they're dated at this point.

02:40:54.740 --> 02:41:06.740
Yeah, I'll definitely look into it. It's going to be a while before I buy even a used retail game because money is kind of, you know, tight at the moment.

02:41:06.740 --> 02:41:19.740
But before I do let you go, there's one more thing I just want to pass along. I don't know if it's on the Xbox marketplace just yet or not.

02:41:19.740 --> 02:41:41.740
It's been a couple days since I checked it. But at least over on the game side of the PSN store, there is, you know, I guess it amounts to a half hour long machinima movie that Rockstar Games had made using Red Dead Redemption.

02:41:41.740 --> 02:41:43.740
Interesting.

02:41:43.740 --> 02:41:59.740
Yeah, totally free download, will cost you a cent. And it clocks in at literally 29 minutes and 6 seconds. I just gave it a brief looking over and it looks kind of decent.

02:41:59.740 --> 02:42:11.740
You know, if Rockstar is behind it, they have a great writing team, so it's probably pretty good. Especially if it's just a video, I don't see why it's not on the 360. I haven't looked, but I don't see why it wouldn't be there.

02:42:11.740 --> 02:42:29.740
Yeah, based on the description I read on the video itself towards the end, the half hour movie is supposed to serve as a prequel to the actual game.

02:42:29.740 --> 02:42:37.740
Alright. Well, Spaznado, we're going to let you go so we can take more calls or wrap the show up. I don't know what we're going to do yet, but have a good one buddy, okay?

02:42:37.740 --> 02:42:39.740
Yep, you too. Take care.

02:42:39.740 --> 02:42:49.740
Alright. It was good to not hear a horror story about the Playstation 3 from Spaznado for a week. It was some positive news. He's keeping it positive tonight for you, Dan.

02:42:49.740 --> 02:42:51.740
He's thinking of playing DDR.

02:42:51.740 --> 02:42:54.740
Are we going to take more calls? Producer Misty, are we taking more calls or fuck them?

02:42:54.740 --> 02:42:56.740
I hope so. Depends on who we get though.

02:42:56.740 --> 02:43:09.740
Alright. Producer Misty says call if you want to try. You have to audition now to be on the show. You have to get through Misty to be on the show.

02:43:09.740 --> 02:43:14.740
1-877-GAME-OLR. Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:43:14.740 --> 02:43:17.740
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

02:43:17.740 --> 02:43:18.740
Hey, it's Rama.

02:43:18.740 --> 02:43:26.740
Hold on, hold on. Before we take your call, Rama. Producer Misty, is there anything you want to make Rama do to see if we can take his call tonight or not?

02:43:26.740 --> 02:43:29.740
No. I thought that it was him, so he's cool.

02:43:29.740 --> 02:43:30.740
Take off your pants.

02:43:30.740 --> 02:43:31.740
Yodel!

02:43:31.740 --> 02:43:33.740
Eat my terrible cooking.

02:43:33.740 --> 02:43:36.740
Your cooking isn't terrible.

02:43:36.740 --> 02:43:37.740
Misty's our Nakane.

02:43:37.740 --> 02:43:41.740
You have a lovely taco.

02:43:41.740 --> 02:43:48.740
Mystique is our local fusion of Nabiki and Akane, so she's our Nakane.

02:43:48.740 --> 02:43:50.740
She agrees.

02:43:50.740 --> 02:43:53.740
Yeah, you guys are starting to scare the living shit out of me right now.

02:43:53.740 --> 02:43:54.740
That's alright.

02:43:54.740 --> 02:43:55.740
Good.

02:43:55.740 --> 02:43:56.740
God dammit.

02:43:56.740 --> 02:43:58.740
Wait, you just tuned in, didn't you?

02:43:58.740 --> 02:44:01.740
Yes, I just tuned in and got rick rolled. I'm like, what the hell?

02:44:01.740 --> 02:44:07.740
I just want to say, this show, like, yeah.

02:44:07.740 --> 02:44:10.740
This show has been awesome.

02:44:10.740 --> 02:44:12.740
I've been doing backflips over the shark all evening.

02:44:12.740 --> 02:44:15.740
It has much more Dan than any other show has ever had.

02:44:15.740 --> 02:44:17.740
I mean, really, I'm on the road with...

02:44:17.740 --> 02:44:20.740
And the promise of Orange on the Road with Mad Libs.

02:44:20.740 --> 02:44:23.740
I'm on the road with DDR Darla Bill. We're coming back from somewhere.

02:44:23.740 --> 02:44:27.740
And I get a text from Gio saying that her boobs got nicknames now.

02:44:27.740 --> 02:44:33.740
I'm fiddling with my phone, trying to get the stream to work with no avail.

02:44:33.740 --> 02:44:35.740
You're trying to get the stream to work.

02:44:35.740 --> 02:44:37.740
You know, they make some medicines.

02:44:37.740 --> 02:44:39.740
Stop it. Stop it right now.

02:44:39.740 --> 02:44:42.740
Rama, I'm so sorry for Dan.

02:44:42.740 --> 02:44:44.740
He's met Dan before.

02:44:44.740 --> 02:44:46.740
Yes, I have.

02:44:46.740 --> 02:44:48.740
He slept at my house.

02:44:48.740 --> 02:44:51.740
Dude, Dan just pitched Pikachu.

02:44:51.740 --> 02:44:52.740
Can we ask what Rama...

02:44:52.740 --> 02:44:54.740
I've met Rama before too.

02:44:54.740 --> 02:44:55.740
Yes.

02:44:55.740 --> 02:44:57.740
Can we ask Rama why he called in tonight?

02:44:57.740 --> 02:44:58.740
We all know Rama.

02:44:58.740 --> 02:44:59.740
Instead of consistently derailing this call.

02:44:59.740 --> 02:45:00.740
Yes, Rama?

02:45:00.740 --> 02:45:06.740
I didn't have much to contribute except for the fact that DJ Hero bundles are now 40 bucks at Best Buy.

02:45:06.740 --> 02:45:07.740
Sweet.

02:45:07.740 --> 02:45:09.740
Now they'll sell a million more.

02:45:09.740 --> 02:45:12.740
I went online earlier this morning and ordered mine.

02:45:12.740 --> 02:45:18.740
And I went to check other places because it seems that Kmart was the first one to do when I was trying to get a price match.

02:45:18.740 --> 02:45:19.740
But Best Buy has it.

02:45:19.740 --> 02:45:26.740
But I find it funny that GameStop is selling their bundles for $49.99 online only in stores still 100 bucks.

02:45:26.740 --> 02:45:28.740
On related news to that.

02:45:28.740 --> 02:45:31.740
This is a great example of how failed the PS3 is.

02:45:31.740 --> 02:45:40.740
At Fry's, the Super Deluxe Logitech Guitar Hero controllers. The drum and the guitar. 50 bucks a piece.

02:45:40.740 --> 02:45:41.740
Wow.

02:45:41.740 --> 02:45:42.740
So I'm looking at that.

02:45:42.740 --> 02:45:43.740
Are you serious?

02:45:43.740 --> 02:45:44.740
Yes, because those are $200 controllers.

02:45:44.740 --> 02:45:47.740
I'm looking at that and I'm like, if they have $360 ones, they're bought.

02:45:47.740 --> 02:45:48.740
They are bought.

02:45:48.740 --> 02:45:51.740
Find the $360 ones, they're still $200 bucks.

02:45:51.740 --> 02:45:58.740
Because honestly, not for nothing, I would drop $200 bucks on the Logitech ones instead of buying the Mad Catz ones.

02:45:58.740 --> 02:46:02.740
I don't care what anyone says. Mad Catz controllers and accessories are pieces of shit.

02:46:02.740 --> 02:46:03.740
You don't say.

02:46:03.740 --> 02:46:06.740
Frisbee in our chatroom says Toys R Us is at 40 bucks as well.

02:46:06.740 --> 02:46:08.740
Their Street Fighter stakes are pretty nice.

02:46:08.740 --> 02:46:16.740
I will say though guys, if you're at all interested in DJ Hero 2, now's the time to go get your controller.

02:46:16.740 --> 02:46:17.740
Yeah.

02:46:17.740 --> 02:46:20.740
And get practically a free DJ Hero 1 with it.

02:46:20.740 --> 02:46:21.740
Yeah.

02:46:21.740 --> 02:46:23.740
There you go. Yeah.

02:46:23.740 --> 02:46:24.740
Yeah.

02:46:24.740 --> 02:46:28.740
Or if you're smart, you buy two bundles and you trade them in one game.

02:46:28.740 --> 02:46:29.740
I'm not smart.

02:46:29.740 --> 02:46:31.740
I just went cross-eyed.

02:46:31.740 --> 02:46:32.740
All right.

02:46:32.740 --> 02:46:34.740
Rama, thanks so much for your call, buddy.

02:46:34.740 --> 02:46:36.740
Anything else you want to share quickly tonight?

02:46:36.740 --> 02:46:38.740
No, that's it.

02:46:38.740 --> 02:46:39.740
All right. Bye.

02:46:39.740 --> 02:46:40.740
Peace.

02:46:40.740 --> 02:46:41.740
All right.

02:46:41.740 --> 02:46:42.740
All right.

02:46:42.740 --> 02:46:44.740
I think that's going to do it for phone calls tonight, guys.

02:46:44.740 --> 02:46:45.740
We got to wrap up.

02:46:45.740 --> 02:46:46.740
I'm glad Rama called.

02:46:46.740 --> 02:46:47.740
I was hoping for him to call.

02:46:47.740 --> 02:46:48.740
I'm looking at Baby.

02:46:48.740 --> 02:46:50.740
Apparently he wasn't really listening most of the night.

02:46:50.740 --> 02:46:51.740
Baby.

02:46:51.740 --> 02:46:52.740
Baby.

02:46:52.740 --> 02:46:53.740
Baby.

02:46:53.740 --> 02:46:55.740
That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Laundry.

02:46:55.740 --> 02:46:56.740
Do we have any last minutes?

02:46:56.740 --> 02:46:57.740
Baby.

02:46:57.740 --> 02:46:58.740
Loki's Baby, I know.

02:46:58.740 --> 02:46:59.740
Baby.

02:46:59.740 --> 02:47:00.740
You can post that in chat.

02:47:00.740 --> 02:47:01.740
It's a public blog.

02:47:01.740 --> 02:47:02.740
Okay.

02:47:02.740 --> 02:47:03.740
Yeah.

02:47:03.740 --> 02:47:04.740
It is adorable.

02:47:04.740 --> 02:47:05.740
Actually, I think a picture of Nellie and Baby is on orangelaundry.com.

02:47:05.740 --> 02:47:07.740
Like in the little flicker thingy at the top.

02:47:07.740 --> 02:47:08.740
I think so.

02:47:08.740 --> 02:47:09.740
Yeah.

02:47:09.740 --> 02:47:10.740
So check it out if you want to see the Baby.

02:47:10.740 --> 02:47:11.740
All right.

02:47:11.740 --> 02:47:12.740
That's going to do it.

02:47:12.740 --> 02:47:13.740
That looks like a baby.

02:47:13.740 --> 02:47:14.740
We're wrapping up tonight's show.

02:47:14.740 --> 02:47:15.740
Do we have any last minute stories?

02:47:15.740 --> 02:47:18.740
Any last minute video game news stories you wanted to talk about?

02:47:18.740 --> 02:47:19.740
Not really.

02:47:19.740 --> 02:47:20.740
Dan?

02:47:20.740 --> 02:47:21.740
I like video games.

02:47:21.740 --> 02:47:22.740
I know.

02:47:22.740 --> 02:47:24.740
But, you know, are we doing an after birth raw?

02:47:24.740 --> 02:47:26.740
Because we really don't do cage match or anything.

02:47:26.740 --> 02:47:27.740
We'll do a quick after birth.

02:47:27.740 --> 02:47:28.740
Okay.

02:47:28.740 --> 02:47:29.740
All right.

02:47:29.740 --> 02:47:30.740
It'll be more of a still birth.

02:47:30.740 --> 02:47:31.740
All right.

02:47:31.740 --> 02:47:32.740
I will take four chat room FUs.

02:47:32.740 --> 02:47:33.740
All right.

02:47:33.740 --> 02:47:34.740
How's that?

02:47:34.740 --> 02:47:35.740
Fus.

02:47:35.740 --> 02:47:36.740
But we got to wrap up the actual podcast part of the show.

02:47:36.740 --> 02:47:37.740
That's it.

02:47:37.740 --> 02:47:38.740
We're done.

02:47:38.740 --> 02:47:39.740
We're out of here.

02:47:39.740 --> 02:47:40.740
Good night.

02:47:40.740 --> 02:47:42.740
I have to go around the room, though, and say before I got to say goodbye to our guests.

02:47:42.740 --> 02:47:44.740
Misty, thank you so much for being here.

02:47:44.740 --> 02:47:45.740
We hope it was fun.

02:47:45.740 --> 02:47:48.740
You picked a hell of a show to attend, I got to say.

02:47:48.740 --> 02:47:51.740
Any episode would have been more epic with me visiting.

02:47:51.740 --> 02:47:53.740
And she's so humble.

02:47:53.740 --> 02:47:54.740
Exactly.

02:47:54.740 --> 02:47:55.740
All right.

02:47:55.740 --> 02:47:58.740
Well, you have a safe trip back, and we'll come back again soon.

02:47:58.740 --> 02:47:59.740
See us real soon.

02:47:59.740 --> 02:48:00.740
All right.

02:48:00.740 --> 02:48:02.740
We're canceling the show because you're not here next week.

02:48:02.740 --> 02:48:03.740
Just so you know.

02:48:03.740 --> 02:48:04.740
Oh, that's the reason.

02:48:04.740 --> 02:48:07.740
So all the listeners that are upset there's no show next week, you need to blame Misty.

02:48:07.740 --> 02:48:09.740
Hey, you told me how to start a show, so it's happening.

02:48:09.740 --> 02:48:11.740
Dan, the man.

02:48:11.740 --> 02:48:14.740
Oh, actually, I got to say, before we go to Dan, Misty, do you have any final thoughts

02:48:14.740 --> 02:48:15.740
for our listeners tonight?

02:48:15.740 --> 02:48:19.740
If I had to pick a theme song for this week, it would probably be the Nickelback song,

02:48:19.740 --> 02:48:20.740
Burn It to the Ground.

02:48:20.740 --> 02:48:23.740
Nickelback is not allowed to be associated with this program.

02:48:23.740 --> 02:48:24.740
That's what I tried to tell her.

02:48:24.740 --> 02:48:25.740
Shut the hell up.

02:48:25.740 --> 02:48:26.740
All right.

02:48:26.740 --> 02:48:27.740
You should hope.

02:48:27.740 --> 02:48:28.740
How many times am I going to tell you that?

02:48:28.740 --> 02:48:29.740
Dan.

02:48:29.740 --> 02:48:31.740
Oh, I'll do Mystique.

02:48:31.740 --> 02:48:32.740
All right.

02:48:32.740 --> 02:48:37.740
Mystique, thank you for, I don't know really what you did here tonight, but thank you for

02:48:37.740 --> 02:48:38.740
the tacos, actually.

02:48:38.740 --> 02:48:39.740
They were amazing.

02:48:39.740 --> 02:48:41.740
I told you I was going to give you some of my meat.

02:48:41.740 --> 02:48:42.740
All right.

02:48:42.740 --> 02:48:43.740
It was delicious.

02:48:43.740 --> 02:48:45.740
Mystique, do you have anything you want to say to listeners?

02:48:45.740 --> 02:48:47.740
Any final thoughts?

02:48:47.740 --> 02:48:50.740
If you want to marry me, you better fork over something valuable.

02:48:50.740 --> 02:48:52.740
There you go.

02:48:52.740 --> 02:48:54.740
I got a dollar.

02:48:54.740 --> 02:48:55.740
All right.

02:48:55.740 --> 02:48:59.740
Dan, sir, thank you so much for being on the show tonight.

02:48:59.740 --> 02:49:02.740
Orange Lounge Radio, starring Dan.

02:49:02.740 --> 02:49:07.740
Despite all the bashing and fun making fun of you, you've been hilarious tonight.

02:49:07.740 --> 02:49:09.740
You've been making fun of me.

02:49:09.740 --> 02:49:10.740
I mean-

02:49:10.740 --> 02:49:11.740
Sounds like you're opposing me, Rob.

02:49:11.740 --> 02:49:12.740
No, I'm not opposing you.

02:49:12.740 --> 02:49:14.740
I already told you what happened to people who oppose me.

02:49:14.740 --> 02:49:16.740
But you've actually been hilarious, and I know the listeners love you.

02:49:16.740 --> 02:49:18.740
So thank you very much for being here tonight.

02:49:18.740 --> 02:49:19.740
That's what I do.

02:49:19.740 --> 02:49:20.740
We'll maybe see you again in a couple weeks.

02:49:20.740 --> 02:49:21.740
Apparently I'll be back in two weeks.

02:49:21.740 --> 02:49:22.740
Apparently.

02:49:22.740 --> 02:49:23.740
It depends on Matt.

02:49:23.740 --> 02:49:24.740
I don't know what's going to happen.

02:49:24.740 --> 02:49:25.740
So we'll see.

02:49:25.740 --> 02:49:26.740
But even if-

02:49:26.740 --> 02:49:27.740
As long as there's no Matt and I have nothing better to do-

02:49:27.740 --> 02:49:28.740
Even if Matt is here-

02:49:28.740 --> 02:49:29.740
I'll be back.

02:49:29.740 --> 02:49:32.740
Even if Matt is here, I'm sure we would all love it if you'd at least drop in.

02:49:32.740 --> 02:49:33.740
Kind of do the Mystique thing.

02:49:33.740 --> 02:49:34.740
Run in the room, say something, and run away.

02:49:34.740 --> 02:49:36.740
I just like sitting at my own desk.

02:49:36.740 --> 02:49:37.740
All right.

02:49:37.740 --> 02:49:38.740
It's good, isn't it?

02:49:38.740 --> 02:49:40.740
Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight, Dan?

02:49:40.740 --> 02:49:41.740
No, not really.

02:49:41.740 --> 02:49:42.740
Okay.

02:49:42.740 --> 02:49:43.740
People from Sweden sound funny.

02:49:43.740 --> 02:49:46.740
All right.

02:49:46.740 --> 02:49:47.740
And it's like, really?

02:49:47.740 --> 02:49:48.740
Old news.

02:49:48.740 --> 02:49:49.740
That was awesome.

02:49:49.740 --> 02:49:50.740
Totally old news.

02:49:50.740 --> 02:49:51.740
All right.

02:49:51.740 --> 02:49:52.740
I'll save Dark Sakura for last, because she likes to have the final, final word.

02:49:52.740 --> 02:49:57.740
My final thought is, I don't know what my final thought is.

02:49:57.740 --> 02:50:01.740
I just, I'm in a better mood now than I was when I got here.

02:50:01.740 --> 02:50:03.740
You have a hot dog twitched your boobs.

02:50:03.740 --> 02:50:04.740
I do.

02:50:04.740 --> 02:50:06.740
I have a hot dog shirt on.

02:50:06.740 --> 02:50:07.740
And that's it.

02:50:07.740 --> 02:50:08.740
Dark Sakura.

02:50:08.740 --> 02:50:09.740
I won!

02:50:09.740 --> 02:50:10.740
Thank you.

02:50:10.740 --> 02:50:15.740

02:50:31.740 --> 02:50:32.740

Have a wonderful two weeks.

02:50:34.740 --> 02:50:38.740
We'll see you back in two weeks with an all new, unless, I don't know, maybe a pre-tape

02:50:38.740 --> 02:50:39.740
will happen, but I want to get your hopes up.

02:50:39.740 --> 02:50:40.740
So we'll see you...

02:50:40.740 --> 02:50:41.740
Rob, unnecessary prefix.

02:50:41.740 --> 02:50:42.740
You know what?

02:50:42.740 --> 02:50:43.740
We'll...

02:50:43.740 --> 02:50:45.740
Shut the hell up.

02:50:45.740 --> 02:50:46.740
You know what?

02:50:46.740 --> 02:50:47.740
This is my house.

02:50:47.740 --> 02:50:48.740
Damn!

02:50:48.740 --> 02:50:50.740
If you don't like it, you get the fuck out.

02:50:50.740 --> 02:50:53.740
And on that note, we'll see you whenever we see you.

02:50:53.740 --> 02:50:54.740
Good night.

02:50:54.740 --> 02:50:57.740
