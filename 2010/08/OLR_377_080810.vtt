[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki Tonight, August 8th, 2010 Connect may not be available for indie games Soon you can play video games with your eyes And a warning for all StarCraft II players

00:31.468 --> 00:37.753
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello my friends and welcome to episode number 377 of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:37.833 --> 00:41.216
[SPEAKER_11]: We are that video game talk show where every gamer has a voice.

00:41.557 --> 00:50.865
[SPEAKER_11]: My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host, the one and only, knocking stuff over, she reaches for her mic, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

00:51.725 --> 00:52.246
[SPEAKER_11]: How you doing?

00:53.387 --> 00:54.448
[SPEAKER_11]: Why are you so angry?

00:55.008 --> 00:55.749
[SPEAKER_11]: Why are you mad though?

00:56.089 --> 01:02.791
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I made a boo-boo and this thing is trying to... I'm trying to get rid of this stupid thing.

01:02.831 --> 01:03.652
[SPEAKER_11]: You made a boo-boo?

01:03.712 --> 01:05.932
[SPEAKER_11]: Please, let's revel in what mistakes you've made.

01:08.533 --> 01:13.795
[SPEAKER_03]: I got that My Security Shield thing because I hit space...

01:15.635 --> 01:19.536
[SPEAKER_11]: So my security shield, is that one of those spammy spam spammers programs?

01:19.796 --> 01:24.878
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called a rogue anti-spyware when it's really the worst kind of spyware there is.

01:25.058 --> 01:28.719
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's spyware disguised as anti-spyware.

01:28.939 --> 01:31.080
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the type of thing my mom would have all over her computer.

01:31.660 --> 01:34.321
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and I'm trying to get rid of it without having to reboot.

01:34.941 --> 01:39.106
[SPEAKER_11]: So, word of warning to those folks out there, watch what you hit the space bar on.

01:39.126 --> 01:39.587
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, right?

01:39.627 --> 01:41.569
[SPEAKER_03]: Just because it looks like your windows doesn't mean it's right.

01:42.030 --> 01:47.517
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was actually right in the middle of typing to somebody on AIM when it popped up.

01:47.717 --> 01:48.258
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate that.

01:48.859 --> 01:50.661
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I use the space bar for everything.

01:50.821 --> 01:51.362
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, of course.

01:52.483 --> 01:53.404
[SPEAKER_11]: Dan the Man

02:17.998 --> 02:18.238
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course.

02:18.258 --> 02:18.458
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course.

02:46.617 --> 02:48.740
[SPEAKER_11]: I just had to throw him a curveball.

02:49.020 --> 02:53.686
[SPEAKER_11]: Dan is going to be helping out while Loki's on vacation because it's really easy for Dan to help out because he lives here.

02:54.447 --> 02:56.269
[SPEAKER_11]: He's usually pretty readily available.

02:57.050 --> 03:05.320
[SPEAKER_11]: Dan will be filling in until Loki decides he's going to come back, which I hope he does decide to come back at some point because there's that part of me that's always wondered.

03:06.101 --> 03:10.142
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, when Loki has this baby, is he going to want to do a little radio show on the internet anymore?

03:11.042 --> 03:14.563
[SPEAKER_11]: Or is he going to worry that the stuff he says on this show his kid might hear someday?

03:14.663 --> 03:15.084
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

03:15.844 --> 03:17.464
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be awfully pathetic.

03:18.425 --> 03:22.466
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I'm positive he will come back, but he can take all the time he needs.

03:22.906 --> 03:23.146
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

03:24.006 --> 03:30.490
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, we'll get back to Dan in a little while, but I want to introduce somebody else to you guys because we have a guest in studio tonight, too.

03:30.990 --> 03:32.371
[SPEAKER_11]: And we're really glad to have her.

03:32.771 --> 03:39.595
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the second time she's been on the show, and she probably would be one of the few guests that come.

03:40.035 --> 03:45.178
[SPEAKER_11]: I can only think of maybe like two or three guests that have traveled further than she has to be on the show.

03:45.558 --> 03:47.459
[SPEAKER_11]: Say hello, everybody, to Misty is here tonight.

03:48.989 --> 03:49.730
[SPEAKER_04]: How you doing, Misty?

03:49.950 --> 03:50.550
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing good.

03:50.770 --> 03:51.590
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, excellent.

03:51.971 --> 03:55.632
[SPEAKER_11]: So, um, let's see, for those that haven't, when was the last time you were on the show?

03:55.653 --> 03:56.913
[SPEAKER_11]: It was about a year ago-ish?

03:57.353 --> 04:06.358
[SPEAKER_04]: No, due to stuff happening last time, we never even got to do a pre-tape segment, so this is my first time, just my second time being in Dan and Jamie's house.

04:06.598 --> 04:08.179
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought for some reason you were on a show.

04:08.299 --> 04:11.260
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, you did, we did like a pre-tape thing or something, huh?

04:11.520 --> 04:12.821
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't even get to that last time.

04:12.881 --> 04:13.121
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

04:13.441 --> 04:13.681
[SPEAKER_04]: Really.

04:13.761 --> 04:15.302
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought you should have been on a show before.

04:15.582 --> 04:16.083
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Rob.

04:17.003 --> 04:17.483
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

04:17.583 --> 04:21.726
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, okay, after 377 episodes, they all start to blur a little bit, okay?

04:21.746 --> 04:22.266
[SPEAKER_11]: Give me a break.

04:22.646 --> 04:27.969
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, well, anyway, well, then welcome to the show at BSMA, but you've called in before and all that good stuff, so hopefully the listeners know you.

04:28.409 --> 04:44.197
[SPEAKER_11]: And also, a lot of listeners may have not heard you because you don't call in every week, but you have a presence on the website, and you've been following the Twitters, and I know you've always been a big supporter of the show, so thank you, first off, for being such a supporter of OLR over the years.

04:44.237 --> 04:45.178
[SPEAKER_11]: When did you first start listening?

04:45.218 --> 04:45.838
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been a while, right?

04:46.457 --> 04:46.817
[SPEAKER_04]: Episode 91.

04:47.638 --> 04:49.278
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow, that's some time ago.

04:49.778 --> 04:51.359
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

04:51.999 --> 04:54.240
[SPEAKER_11]: What is the best thing about Orange Lawn Tradio, you think?

04:54.480 --> 04:56.221
[SPEAKER_11]: Just to inflate our egos a little bit.

04:57.762 --> 05:01.843
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, it's back more toward the DDR and random days.

05:02.964 --> 05:06.365
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, the tangents that pop up now still make it worth it.

05:06.840 --> 05:18.129
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I've kind of heard that, that even though we're not a music-based game show anymore, kind of like the community that still lives on because of that, I've definitely heard is like a thing that people like about the show.

05:18.609 --> 05:28.297
[SPEAKER_11]: And certainly, you know, as much as I've hated on a lot of the recent games that that same company's put out that gave us DDR, obviously the show wouldn't exist if it weren't for that.

05:28.397 --> 05:30.198
[SPEAKER_11]: And for that, I will always be thankful.

05:30.278 --> 05:36.043
[SPEAKER_11]: And there'll always be a part of me that wants to play those games as crappy as they are these days.

05:36.423 --> 05:48.907
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, anyhow, so Misty will be joining us and we'll talk to her a little more a little later, but we're going to get into a little bit of how was your gaming week, because we always start off the show talking about our gaming weeks and what we've been playing, so let's go over to DarkSakura.

05:49.847 --> 05:53.409
[SPEAKER_11]: What have you been playing besides Download, Adaware, and Spybot as quickly as possible?

05:54.829 --> 06:04.132
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, um, well, I played some Ragnarok and Star Trek Online, as usual, and then I made Dan play stuff for me so I could watch.

06:06.314 --> 06:07.575
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, that's right.

06:07.595 --> 06:08.796
[SPEAKER_11]: You still have the hand thing going on.

06:08.816 --> 06:10.677
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's not seeping joint fluid anymore.

06:10.737 --> 06:13.079
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, actually, I can stand to look at it now.

06:13.139 --> 06:14.920
[SPEAKER_11]: I get very squeamish with the whole blood thing.

06:15.340 --> 06:16.161
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want to touch it.

06:16.641 --> 06:17.482
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to touch it.

06:17.542 --> 06:18.782
[SPEAKER_02]: Touch it, touch it, touch it.

06:18.802 --> 06:18.863
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?

06:19.043 --> 06:20.043
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's not gross.

06:22.025 --> 06:24.006
[SPEAKER_03]: I meant the side of the hole, not the hole.

06:24.266 --> 06:24.906
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I touched the hole.

06:24.926 --> 06:25.907
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob touched the hole.

06:26.567 --> 06:27.468
[SPEAKER_11]: I touched Jamie's hole.

06:27.508 --> 06:27.888
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, Dan.

06:28.249 --> 06:28.509
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

06:28.749 --> 06:30.710
[SPEAKER_11]: No problem.

06:32.411 --> 06:32.651
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

06:32.751 --> 06:33.352
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Rob.

06:36.531 --> 06:38.392
[SPEAKER_11]: At least the hole's in your hand and not in your head.

06:40.933 --> 06:44.515
[SPEAKER_03]: Dan played the games for me so that I could watch and then go, what?

06:44.936 --> 06:46.997
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, well Dan, we'll skip on over to you.

06:47.237 --> 06:48.597
[SPEAKER_11]: What kind of games have you been playing this week?

06:49.258 --> 06:52.580
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been playing Hydra Thunder Hurricane, which is awesome.

06:52.940 --> 06:53.740
[SPEAKER_11]: Why is it awesome?

06:53.760 --> 06:57.202
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I downloaded it and I was like, this just isn't the same.

06:57.222 --> 06:59.303
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I love jet boat racing.

06:59.964 --> 07:02.485
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't understand why, but it's awesome.

07:03.444 --> 07:09.966
[SPEAKER_01]: I can, like, jump my boat, break things, win races, go online, get my ass kicked.

07:10.627 --> 07:11.207
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing.

07:11.787 --> 07:14.788
[SPEAKER_11]: Why is it that everybody online is better than me?

07:15.188 --> 07:16.449
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, I can't figure this out.

07:16.489 --> 07:18.209
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, it doesn't matter what game I play.

07:18.609 --> 07:19.970
[SPEAKER_11]: And is it just me, guys?

07:20.270 --> 07:24.011
[SPEAKER_11]: Whenever I go online and play a game online, I am always in last place.

07:24.151 --> 07:31.054
[SPEAKER_11]: Unless... It's not... See, she didn't have a mic, so...

07:33.435 --> 07:37.458
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the way Mystique works.

07:37.638 --> 07:40.740
[SPEAKER_11]: Stop it.

07:40.780 --> 07:41.840
[SPEAKER_11]: We're doing a radio show.

07:42.421 --> 07:43.221
[SPEAKER_03]: She doesn't care.

07:43.862 --> 07:49.445
[SPEAKER_11]: Dan and Jamie's friend, Mystique, she's funny and she ran in here and just whispered.

07:49.925 --> 07:50.966
[SPEAKER_11]: I said, why do I always come in last?

07:51.006 --> 07:53.488
[SPEAKER_11]: She just came in here and whispered, it's because you're gay.

07:53.568 --> 07:55.309
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's why everybody started laughing.

07:55.851 --> 08:06.277
[SPEAKER_11]: And then she came in here and gave the thumbs up So anyway We gotta get a wireless mic for Mystique So that way when she runs in and out we'll still get her Anyway Where was I?

08:06.357 --> 08:18.083
[SPEAKER_11]: See now I got lost Thanks Mystique for derailing the whole goddamn show We're talking about my gaming week And you decided to lament the fact that you suck at games online Yes I suck at video games online Why is it Halo last place?

08:18.804 --> 08:22.686
[SPEAKER_04]: I would think partially Because the only game I'll typically play online is Rock Band 2

08:24.145 --> 08:25.425
[SPEAKER_11]: I do okay with the music games.

08:25.505 --> 08:29.626
[SPEAKER_11]: DDR, like Ultramix back in the day, I would kick your ass at Ultramix.

08:29.706 --> 08:29.966
[SPEAKER_11]: I will.

08:30.646 --> 08:34.167
[SPEAKER_11]: But there were some very scary people that could even beat me, but that's one of the few.

08:35.067 --> 08:36.408
[SPEAKER_11]: But like, okay, Blur.

08:36.548 --> 08:37.208
[SPEAKER_11]: Have you played Blur?

08:37.628 --> 08:38.368
[SPEAKER_11]: The online racing game?

08:38.388 --> 08:39.988
[SPEAKER_11]: Have you played it online at all against other people?

08:40.229 --> 08:40.449
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

08:40.809 --> 08:46.330
[SPEAKER_11]: Usually I do really shitty, but one time, one time, I actually won a race.

08:47.270 --> 09:04.900
[SPEAKER_11]: I won a race against like 10 other people and I was so excited I'll admit, I felt a little tingle down there I was so excited Wow And that's like the only time that's ever happened Alright And that new downloadable Castlevania How is the new downloadable Castlevania?

09:05.141 --> 09:15.867
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I only played the trial So, uh, it's interesting It seems like it'd probably be really cool with a crew of people, but by yourself not very fun

09:16.471 --> 09:19.987
[SPEAKER_11]: I've heard it's an awesome multiplayer game but I have yet to experience the multiplayer.

09:20.731 --> 09:21.394
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you download it?

09:22.023 --> 09:50.358
[SPEAKER_11]: I checked out the demo for a little bit and I played it at E3 a few months ago and when I was at E3 I was like this game's kind of weird but it's kind of interesting and fun and when I downloaded it I was like yeah this is still kind of weird like I just the thing I don't like about the game and I don't like games that do this is that the game really just throws you in with no description whatsoever and look guys I realize most Atari 2600 games and NES games back in the day did the same thing

09:50.838 --> 09:52.719
[SPEAKER_11]: Mario doesn't tell you what to do.

09:53.199 --> 09:55.500
[SPEAKER_11]: But games were less complicated back then.

09:57.562 --> 09:58.322
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes a second.

09:58.802 --> 10:00.303
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's so many buttons and stuff.

10:00.443 --> 10:05.185
[SPEAKER_11]: Usually I need a little bit of a tutorial, but all I see in Castlevania is Boss.

10:05.806 --> 10:09.468
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm like, okay, I'll go do that.

10:09.508 --> 10:13.430
[SPEAKER_11]: But then every time I think I know the way to the boss, there's a fucking wall there or something.

10:13.450 --> 10:15.611
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, why didn't I see that when I was looking at the whole map?

10:15.891 --> 10:18.632
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems to be my new four people who are going to download it.

10:19.272 --> 10:20.093
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd be worth my money.

10:21.074 --> 10:22.376
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it $15?

10:22.476 --> 10:22.677
[SPEAKER_01]: It is $15.

10:24.199 --> 10:25.020
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where it's at now.

10:25.060 --> 10:27.064
[SPEAKER_01]: If it was $10, it would be almost an automatic anyway.

10:27.364 --> 10:35.517
[SPEAKER_01]: The $15 thing, except for a game like Hurricane, which is obviously an undertaking, it seems to me like that's a little excessive for Castlevania.

10:36.314 --> 10:39.216
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, I'm going to go to the chat room because chat rooms are filling up with comments here.

10:39.276 --> 10:44.459
[SPEAKER_11]: Chat.OrangeLawnsRadio.com We love our chatters and every week they join us here.

10:44.860 --> 10:45.220
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see.

10:45.560 --> 10:49.723
[SPEAKER_11]: Tiger Claw is going to start us off tonight saying in response to the why do I always lose online.

10:50.123 --> 10:50.964
[SPEAKER_11]: Sky, it's simple.

10:50.984 --> 10:52.765
[SPEAKER_11]: They've been playing the game a whole lot.

10:52.965 --> 10:56.187
[SPEAKER_11]: If you're someone who plays casual, you'll get your ass kicked online.

10:57.128 --> 10:57.688
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, pretty much.

10:57.948 --> 11:02.932
[SPEAKER_11]: He also goes on to say I haven't played StarCraft 2 online yet knowing I'll just get my ass whooped.

11:03.232 --> 11:05.994
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to play it online but only doing co-op games.

11:06.574 --> 11:22.724
[SPEAKER_11]: it's kind of how I feel about a lot of that stuff too but yet I play World of Warcraft and I actually really enjoy PvP and World of Warcraft but that's, World of Warcraft's like not like other games it's really not, games like that their MMOs are in a little bubble of their own they're not like other stuff

11:23.264 --> 11:27.165
[SPEAKER_11]: Leo Shen in our chat says, Rob, try BlazBlue, BlazeBlue, whatever you want to say, CS.

11:27.565 --> 11:30.206
[SPEAKER_11]: They have a beginner mode that works with online mode.

11:30.226 --> 11:31.827
[SPEAKER_11]: You can button mash your way to victory.

11:32.887 --> 11:33.487
[SPEAKER_11]: Sounds good to me.

11:34.167 --> 11:34.508
[SPEAKER_11]: There you go.

11:34.768 --> 11:43.310
[SPEAKER_11]: And AmazeSatsuma... AmazeSatsuma chimes in and says, the new Castlevania does have a good multiplayer game.

11:44.371 --> 11:46.071
[SPEAKER_11]: There you go.

11:47.792 --> 11:48.092
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello.

11:48.212 --> 11:48.432
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi.

11:48.492 --> 11:48.572
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi.

11:50.376 --> 11:50.896
[SPEAKER_11]: and your mic.

11:50.936 --> 11:52.056
[SPEAKER_03]: Now your mic is ruined again.

11:52.596 --> 11:53.697
[SPEAKER_03]: How about this?

11:53.717 --> 11:54.897
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we're good.

11:54.997 --> 12:01.078
[SPEAKER_03]: I was explaining to Dan why we can't have more than three people in the chat room because the moment number four pops in, boot.

12:01.318 --> 12:02.358
[SPEAKER_11]: Is Misty on 3G though?

12:02.418 --> 12:02.958
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you on 3G?

12:03.459 --> 12:04.259
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm on Wi-Fi.

12:04.419 --> 12:06.079
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you switch to 3G or will your app stop working?

12:06.779 --> 12:07.959
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all Wi-Fi for mine.

12:07.979 --> 12:09.620
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember, I have no fancy iPhone.

12:10.120 --> 12:10.560
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, that's right.

12:10.580 --> 12:11.900
[SPEAKER_11]: You have an iPhone.

12:12.240 --> 12:13.440
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like an iPhone.

12:13.861 --> 12:14.161
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

12:14.461 --> 12:14.761
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right.

12:14.781 --> 12:15.061
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll live.

12:15.601 --> 12:15.841
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

12:17.202 --> 12:18.203
[SPEAKER_11]: Dan, you can look over here.

12:18.283 --> 12:20.383
[SPEAKER_11]: It's always there.

12:20.563 --> 12:24.945
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, chat.orangeentree.com if you want to chat with the host, except for Dan because he can't get in.

12:25.705 --> 12:26.426
[SPEAKER_11]: Screw you people.

12:27.106 --> 12:27.706
[SPEAKER_04]: You have a mic.

12:27.726 --> 12:28.706
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do you need IRC?

12:29.847 --> 12:30.927
[SPEAKER_11]: So I can see what people are saying.

12:31.087 --> 12:32.828
[SPEAKER_11]: He wants to know when people are talking shit about him.

12:32.968 --> 12:35.129
[SPEAKER_11]: If people are talking shit, I'll let you know.

12:36.129 --> 12:36.950
[SPEAKER_03]: Holy crap.

12:37.431 --> 12:37.972
[SPEAKER_11]: You okay there?

12:38.472 --> 12:41.957
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I was running Hijack This to see if I could find it, but there's way too many things that are running.

12:42.538 --> 12:43.459
[SPEAKER_01]: Jamie's computer is super broken.

12:43.479 --> 12:48.666
[SPEAKER_11]: Jamie has downloaded like seven anti-spyware programs since the time I sat down in this chair.

12:48.706 --> 12:50.608
[SPEAKER_02]: I just downloaded Hijack This and Attaware.

12:50.849 --> 12:52.431
[SPEAKER_02]: Because... But I haven't rebooted.

12:52.571 --> 12:53.251
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

13:18.448 --> 13:20.229
[SPEAKER_03]: But no!

13:20.789 --> 13:27.393
[SPEAKER_03]: For the record, I was going to a site that explained the history of gay people in the Old Testament.

13:27.754 --> 13:28.234
[SPEAKER_11]: Porn!

13:30.855 --> 13:32.656
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know why you're giving her shit about it, Dan.

13:32.676 --> 13:33.597
[SPEAKER_03]: You made her download it.

13:33.977 --> 13:36.839
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to read the article and instead it did this shit to me.

13:37.599 --> 13:39.300
[SPEAKER_03]: I was trying to be conscientious!

13:40.421 --> 13:41.902
[SPEAKER_01]: I get my porn from other websites.

13:42.282 --> 13:43.643
[SPEAKER_03]: I get my porn from kicking you.

13:45.244 --> 13:47.405
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, anything else that you played this week, Dan?

13:48.633 --> 13:52.738
[SPEAKER_01]: I played a bunch of Genesis games because my wife was like, play Genesis games.

13:52.798 --> 13:54.379
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I heard there was Sega Night last night.

13:54.600 --> 13:55.801
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't know.

13:56.221 --> 14:02.308
[SPEAKER_01]: All I know is Jamie wanted me to get beat because she picked every one of the hardest Genesis games and was like, play this, play this.

14:02.748 --> 14:04.290
[SPEAKER_01]: Finally, she goes back for another batch of games.

14:04.310 --> 14:06.752
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, if she comes back with Gunstar Heroes, I'm going to shoot her.

14:07.593 --> 14:09.075
[SPEAKER_01]: And she came back with Gunstar Heroes.

14:10.450 --> 14:13.054
[SPEAKER_03]: What was the other game that I brought?

14:14.617 --> 14:16.099
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember what the other one was.

14:16.439 --> 14:18.002
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no, it wasn't Midnight Resistance.

14:18.062 --> 14:18.302
[SPEAKER_03]: It was...

14:20.225 --> 14:21.085
[SPEAKER_03]: Something else difficult.

14:21.546 --> 14:25.468
[SPEAKER_03]: But the games that I brought out were, well, there was Robo Aleste and Sylphied.

14:25.488 --> 14:26.428
[SPEAKER_01]: Every freaking game.

14:26.528 --> 14:34.172
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Sylphied, Robo Aleste, Shadow Dancer, Strider, which is normally a game that I would just dominate without even thinking about it.

14:34.232 --> 14:39.115
[SPEAKER_01]: And tonight, or last night, every cheap death, I was like, son of a bitch.

14:39.515 --> 14:41.436
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, terrible stuff.

14:41.456 --> 14:44.477
[SPEAKER_11]: Didn't you beat Strider with your eyes closed once or something crazy?

14:44.898 --> 14:47.459
[SPEAKER_01]: I've beaten Strider every which way.

14:49.039 --> 14:53.560
[SPEAKER_01]: Seriously, and last night, like I said, I continued three times, didn't finish the game.

14:54.140 --> 14:57.621
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just like, alright, that's plenty of that.

14:59.242 --> 15:04.924
[SPEAKER_03]: For the record, it was two stages that I beat with my eyes closed.

15:06.444 --> 15:08.244
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no idea what you're talking about.

15:08.625 --> 15:10.965
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, when I was a kid, I could beat 8-1 on Super Mario Bros.

15:11.005 --> 15:13.506
[SPEAKER_03]: with my eyes closed because I had the level timed.

15:15.761 --> 15:20.703
[SPEAKER_11]: I could get through 8-1 without stopping, but I couldn't do it with my eyes closed.

15:20.763 --> 15:22.824
[SPEAKER_11]: But I could do it continuously running through the whole thing.

15:23.464 --> 15:24.364
[SPEAKER_11]: I couldn't do that anymore.

15:25.345 --> 15:28.846
[SPEAKER_03]: I can still get through it running, it's just I can't do it blindfolded anymore because I don't remember the timing.

15:32.529 --> 15:35.852
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to know what crazy accomplishments our chatters have accomplished in video games.

15:35.912 --> 15:37.773
[SPEAKER_11]: Like weird shit.

15:37.914 --> 15:39.215
[SPEAKER_11]: Like you beat a game.

15:39.295 --> 15:39.935
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, great.

15:39.975 --> 15:40.976
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we all beat games.

15:41.317 --> 15:47.202
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to know you beat a game while hanging upside down, getting water shot at your face or something.

15:47.662 --> 15:50.685
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to know what crazy video game accomplishments you guys have done.

15:51.065 --> 15:51.926
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be fun to know about.

15:52.486 --> 15:56.288
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, in the meantime, I'll talk about my gaming week, which actually was kind of non-existent.

15:56.308 --> 15:58.089
[SPEAKER_11]: I think I pretty much hit on everything I played this week.

15:58.409 --> 16:04.532
[SPEAKER_11]: I had a really busy week, so I didn't get a lot done, and I really didn't get a lot done with the podcast, so I apologize for that.

16:04.552 --> 16:05.313
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll talk about that in a minute.

16:05.673 --> 16:09.695
[SPEAKER_11]: But I didn't play a lot outside of Warcraft.

16:09.755 --> 16:12.417
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll give you guys a Warcraft update, for those that care, all two of you.

16:12.437 --> 16:12.837
[SPEAKER_11]: Woo!

16:13.297 --> 16:13.657
[SPEAKER_11]: Shut up.

16:14.877 --> 16:16.578
[SPEAKER_11]: Our guild is now in Icecrown Citadel.

16:16.598 --> 16:24.219
[SPEAKER_11]: Because remember, our guild is about six months behind all the other guilds because we didn't start raiding until about six weeks ago, probably, at this point.

16:24.599 --> 16:25.780
[SPEAKER_11]: We're now in Icecrown Citadel.

16:25.820 --> 16:27.160
[SPEAKER_03]: You were raiding, but it wasn't lairs.

16:28.480 --> 16:32.461
[SPEAKER_11]: We're in Icecrown Citadel now, and we took out the fourth boss, Sourfang.

16:32.821 --> 16:34.121
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's how far we are right now.

16:34.202 --> 16:35.102
[SPEAKER_03]: Sourfang.

16:35.142 --> 16:36.222
[SPEAKER_11]: Sourfang.

16:36.362 --> 16:40.843
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I was like, if it's Sourfang, that guy had to be like... It's with you, it's not no.

16:41.961 --> 16:47.585
[SPEAKER_15]: I was saying if it was Sour, then I'd be like, okay, what's going to be my fear-instilling nickname?

16:48.466 --> 16:52.929
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, he got Bloodfang, and this one got Evilfang, and this one's Darkfang.

16:52.969 --> 16:54.311
[SPEAKER_15]: I guess I'll go with Sour.

16:55.491 --> 16:56.312
[SPEAKER_11]: Sourfang.

16:56.392 --> 16:57.013
[SPEAKER_11]: Sour.

16:57.033 --> 16:58.134
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not like Sourfang.

16:58.194 --> 16:58.894
[SPEAKER_11]: Sourfang.

16:58.934 --> 16:59.715
[SPEAKER_15]: Sour.

16:59.815 --> 17:00.636
[SPEAKER_15]: That sounds like a dog.

17:00.916 --> 17:01.697
[SPEAKER_15]: Sour.

17:02.037 --> 17:02.337
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

17:03.118 --> 17:05.239
[SPEAKER_11]: So, yeah, that was the ICC accomplishments.

17:05.740 --> 17:07.381
[SPEAKER_03]: I am on number four, by the way.

17:07.641 --> 17:08.342
[SPEAKER_11]: Number four, Bloodfang.

17:09.105 --> 17:15.868
[SPEAKER_03]: Removal Program Number 4 The AVG's good It's all the stuff that I should have put on here to begin with So you know what the problem with this whole thing is?

17:15.988 --> 17:29.835
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna have to fix your computer The fuck you will I fixed your computer when you had that stupid thing that kept popping up You remember that one registry thing that would keep replicating itself every time you deleted the registry file unless you removed yourself from the internet?

17:29.975 --> 17:31.876
[SPEAKER_11]: No, because I really try not to get that shit on my computer

17:32.768 --> 17:33.509
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody got it.

17:33.909 --> 17:34.970
[SPEAKER_03]: And I removed it off Dan's.

17:35.371 --> 17:36.532
[SPEAKER_11]: I have no idea what you're talking about.

17:36.552 --> 17:38.454
[SPEAKER_11]: I just had a video card explode on me once.

17:38.494 --> 17:44.260
[SPEAKER_11]: That was really... I don't get a lot of... Well, my WoW account got hacked about... When was it?

17:44.280 --> 17:46.101
[SPEAKER_11]: It was when I was in Disneyland October.

17:46.121 --> 17:47.843
[SPEAKER_11]: So it was about almost a year ago now.

17:48.324 --> 17:49.285
[SPEAKER_11]: My WoW account... Shut up.

17:49.585 --> 17:50.806
[SPEAKER_11]: No, that was a really long time ago.

17:51.807 --> 17:53.468
[SPEAKER_11]: My WoW account got hacked.

17:53.588 --> 17:55.610
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was like, how the hell did that happen?

17:55.930 --> 17:57.011
[SPEAKER_11]: Did somebody get my password?

17:57.271 --> 17:59.512
[SPEAKER_11]: What kind of keylogger got on my computer?

17:59.552 --> 18:00.473
[SPEAKER_11]: Who else has my password?

18:00.493 --> 18:01.273
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I figured it out.

18:01.313 --> 18:04.555
[SPEAKER_11]: You know how I am pretty convinced somebody got my Warcraft password?

18:05.116 --> 18:08.998
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I used to play on my ex's computer and he was dumb enough to get all that spyware stuff.

18:09.058 --> 18:14.362
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's how they got my password because I made the mistake of playing on someone else's computer and didn't know better.

18:15.942 --> 18:16.843
[SPEAKER_11]: Word of warning, everybody.

18:16.863 --> 18:20.366
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think that I've already uninstalled World of Warcraft from my computer?

18:20.827 --> 18:24.210
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though I probably won't ever play it again, I don't want them to get my account.

18:24.591 --> 18:26.933
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they would have stole your World of Warcraft account.

18:27.393 --> 18:29.716
[SPEAKER_03]: They would have stole all the gold Rob gave me.

18:30.416 --> 18:35.541
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, while I'm X-bashing here on the show, can I tell you something else I realized?

18:35.601 --> 18:35.982
[SPEAKER_03]: Which one?

18:36.002 --> 18:37.243
[SPEAKER_11]: It actually has to do with gaming.

18:38.264 --> 18:38.965
[SPEAKER_11]: You know which one.

18:39.005 --> 18:39.305
[SPEAKER_11]: The one...

18:42.177 --> 18:42.297
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh!

18:42.317 --> 18:43.077
[SPEAKER_11]: I mouthed it off air.

18:44.178 --> 18:44.738
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yes.

18:44.898 --> 18:48.359
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I don't want to, you know, do slanderous or anything.

18:48.399 --> 18:49.460
[SPEAKER_11]: But no, here's the thing.

18:49.540 --> 18:52.621
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually realized this today while I was driving down listening to another podcast.

18:52.961 --> 18:58.303
[SPEAKER_11]: You know how I've been really afraid to play StarCraft 2 because I think it's too hard and I'm not really good at RTS games.

18:58.343 --> 19:01.684
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm really worried that the game is not... Like, I'm not going to be able to do well at the game.

19:02.264 --> 19:06.085
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I realized that my ex was a big StarCraft fan.

19:06.345 --> 19:10.427
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, he actually... His online name was actually based out of the StarCraft universe and everything and it really hit me.

19:10.467 --> 19:10.847
[SPEAKER_11]: I was like...

19:11.707 --> 19:25.386
[SPEAKER_11]: if that dumb fuck can play StarCraft I can play StarCraft so I'm gonna go out and buy StarCraft 2 tomorrow I'm Jim Raynor 1262 hardcore StarCraft fan well you were still supposed to bring me something Rob

19:26.887 --> 19:28.608
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, Final Fantasy XIII, yes.

19:28.728 --> 19:30.069
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't been home.

19:30.089 --> 19:31.450
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't been home.

19:31.510 --> 19:35.992
[SPEAKER_01]: If you put it on the easiest setting, by the way, StarCraft II is, like, hyper easy.

19:36.352 --> 19:36.792
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it really?

19:36.933 --> 19:40.114
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like two enemy soldiers come out and you're just like, die!

19:40.234 --> 19:40.515
[SPEAKER_11]: That's good.

19:40.735 --> 19:49.920
[SPEAKER_11]: Blackwolf, our good pal who does the show before us here at All Games Radio, which, by the way, I don't remember if I said this, but we do tape live every week at www.allgames.com right after Bobby Blackwolf's show.

19:50.980 --> 19:53.962
[SPEAKER_11]: Bobby Blackwolf says casual mode is reasonable, Rob.

19:54.502 --> 19:55.483
[SPEAKER_11]: So, there you go.

19:55.503 --> 19:56.043
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess that's cool.

19:56.397 --> 19:57.218
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

20:11.220 --> 20:11.740
[SPEAKER_11]: It's too much.

20:12.241 --> 20:13.482
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm weird, you guys.

20:13.602 --> 20:14.822
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you seeing this?

20:15.023 --> 20:16.484
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't play a lot of RTSs yet.

20:16.504 --> 20:17.364
[SPEAKER_11]: This thing is amazing.

20:17.484 --> 20:19.245
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, Jamie got that out when you were gone last week.

20:19.526 --> 20:22.488
[SPEAKER_11]: I was thumbing through it, and I turned everything upside down and put it back.

20:22.828 --> 20:23.208
[SPEAKER_11]: Sweet.

20:23.308 --> 20:24.209
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

20:24.269 --> 20:24.669
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see.

20:24.689 --> 20:37.558
[SPEAKER_11]: I was asking for gaming accomplishments, and I didn't see a lot, but I do see SalaciousPop in our chat room says, I got up to stage five in Battletoads on one set of lives once.

20:38.098 --> 20:38.238
[SPEAKER_01]: Once.

20:38.378 --> 20:39.239
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an accomplishment.

20:39.259 --> 20:39.979
[SPEAKER_11]: That is an accomplishment.

20:40.119 --> 20:41.000
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, oh, wow.

20:42.142 --> 20:48.297
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, I beat the original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles NES game twice with all four turtles alive.

20:49.220 --> 20:50.002
[SPEAKER_11]: That's pretty hardcore.

20:51.244 --> 20:53.025
[SPEAKER_01]: I had my first Rage Quit, Rob!

21:19.824 --> 21:20.405
[SPEAKER_11]: Rage quit.

21:20.605 --> 21:20.946
[SPEAKER_11]: In what?

21:21.006 --> 21:21.847
[SPEAKER_03]: In Star Trek Online.

21:22.027 --> 21:22.308
[SPEAKER_11]: Really?

21:22.548 --> 21:23.690
[SPEAKER_03]: Because my ship got blewed up.

21:24.070 --> 21:25.132
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, fuck this.

21:25.592 --> 21:25.953
[SPEAKER_03]: Exit.

21:26.854 --> 21:28.737
[SPEAKER_11]: I rage quit playing Genesis games last night.

21:30.019 --> 21:30.299
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

21:30.860 --> 21:31.781
[SPEAKER_11]: I got to ask Misty.

21:31.941 --> 21:33.724
[SPEAKER_11]: Misty, I don't want to neglect you and your gaming week.

21:33.764 --> 21:34.365
[SPEAKER_11]: How was your gaming week?

21:35.188 --> 21:38.710
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't forget to talk in that mic on, or we can't hear you.

21:54.119 --> 21:55.440
[SPEAKER_04]: But basically non-existent.

21:55.600 --> 21:56.401
[SPEAKER_04]: Rock Band 2.

21:57.122 --> 21:59.564
[SPEAKER_04]: Bought some stupid Rainbow Unicorn game.

21:59.604 --> 22:00.244
[SPEAKER_04]: I blame Rob.

22:00.605 --> 22:01.846
[SPEAKER_11]: Rainbow Unicorn game is awesome.

22:02.266 --> 22:03.647
[SPEAKER_11]: Robot Unicorn Attack on iPhone.

22:03.807 --> 22:07.630
[SPEAKER_03]: What about the one where you get ass, is it?

22:07.731 --> 22:08.351
[SPEAKER_03]: Pink anus.

22:08.511 --> 22:09.432
[SPEAKER_03]: Pink anus.

22:09.452 --> 22:10.153
[SPEAKER_03]: That's on Steam.

22:10.313 --> 22:11.113
[SPEAKER_03]: I have that game.

22:11.354 --> 22:11.794
[SPEAKER_11]: I know you do.

22:11.994 --> 22:12.274
[SPEAKER_11]: Really?

22:12.935 --> 22:13.636
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

22:13.916 --> 22:16.118
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a unicorn game and there's a...

22:16.698 --> 22:18.520
[SPEAKER_11]: How many times have I told the story on this show already?

22:18.720 --> 22:24.184
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a mineral or something that you use to, like, I don't know, perfect your unicorns, polish their horns, we'll say.

22:26.486 --> 22:27.126
[SPEAKER_11]: It's anus.

22:27.406 --> 22:28.607
[SPEAKER_11]: A-E-N-U-S.

22:29.448 --> 22:32.390
[SPEAKER_11]: So you collect pink anus to polish their horns, basically.

22:32.951 --> 22:33.331
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew that.

22:33.371 --> 22:34.272
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted to hear you say it.

22:34.372 --> 22:34.852
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

22:36.914 --> 22:37.594
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, anyway.

22:40.657 --> 22:42.518
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, anything else for your gaming week, Misty?

22:44.119 --> 22:44.660
[SPEAKER_04]: Not really.

22:45.973 --> 22:48.301
[SPEAKER_11]: And by the way, you took a flight out here for the first time, right?

22:48.321 --> 22:49.405
[SPEAKER_11]: Wasn't this your first time flying?

22:49.425 --> 22:50.188
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, it was.

22:50.268 --> 22:51.071
[SPEAKER_11]: How was it?

22:51.151 --> 22:51.733
[SPEAKER_11]: Was it that bad?

22:53.811 --> 22:57.372
[SPEAKER_04]: Surprisingly, the only time I was really that nervous was during takeoff.

22:57.392 --> 23:01.013
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, and then once you got in the air, you just took a Valium and everything was okay?

23:01.053 --> 23:02.693
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

23:02.733 --> 23:05.514
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I had drugs in case I needed them, though.

23:06.775 --> 23:08.035
[SPEAKER_11]: Just in case, some standby.

23:08.375 --> 23:10.596
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, but no, it wasn't too bad.

23:11.516 --> 23:19.598
[SPEAKER_04]: Hell, by about the time we got over the Grand Canyon, I was even kind of getting to the point where I could look out the window for more than half a second before having to look away.

23:20.427 --> 23:21.708
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, but looking out the window is great.

23:21.728 --> 23:23.990
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I like going over lakes and taking pictures of them.

23:25.191 --> 23:34.238
[SPEAKER_11]: I like flying JetBlue or Frontier or any airline that has the television in the seat in front of me because then I just... And I literally did this once.

23:34.299 --> 23:40.864
[SPEAKER_11]: I was on a flight to New York, which is about five and a half hours from SAC or SF, and I watched SpongeBob SquarePants the entire way.

23:40.884 --> 23:42.025
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was the best flight I ever took.

23:42.405 --> 23:44.087
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't have to think about the takeoff.

23:44.467 --> 23:48.871
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, yeah, it's noisy, but otherwise it was like, you know, SpongeBob SquarePants.

23:49.031 --> 23:49.271
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway.

23:49.764 --> 23:54.046
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, but you bet I whipped out my iPod as soon as they announced that we had reached cruising altitude.

23:54.706 --> 23:57.367
[SPEAKER_04]: And even then I didn't buy the book I bought through the Kindle app.

23:58.847 --> 23:59.367
[SPEAKER_11]: Isn't that funny?

23:59.387 --> 24:01.888
[SPEAKER_11]: You'll bring all this shit and you're like, yeah, I'm gonna watch a movie on the plane.

24:01.908 --> 24:03.189
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm gonna play this game.

24:03.269 --> 24:04.589
[SPEAKER_11]: And then, like, you just fall asleep.

24:05.350 --> 24:06.210
[SPEAKER_11]: At least that's what I do.

24:06.721 --> 24:12.346
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there's more attention span for me, but that is part of the reason I made it a point not to pack any physical books.

24:12.426 --> 24:17.551
[SPEAKER_04]: Just my iPod and a notebook for writing up my ghetto blog, mainly.

24:17.872 --> 24:27.641
[SPEAKER_03]: I really like having my netbook because since I have an 8-hour battery on it, I can just watch movies and Doctor Who and stuff the entire time.

24:28.686 --> 24:30.606
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll tell you what I still do on planes.

24:30.766 --> 24:31.767
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is old school.

24:32.527 --> 24:36.687
[SPEAKER_11]: Back in my day, before we had a Game Boy, this is what we did, okay?

24:37.988 --> 24:39.648
[SPEAKER_11]: And still, to this day, I like to do this.

24:40.368 --> 24:42.348
[SPEAKER_11]: You know those variety games books?

24:42.428 --> 24:46.169
[SPEAKER_11]: They're like the penny press variety crossword puzzles in games.

24:46.189 --> 24:51.410
[SPEAKER_11]: They have the crosswords and the anagram puzzles and the logic puzzles and all those.

24:51.770 --> 24:53.750
[SPEAKER_11]: Surely someone in chat knows what I'm talking about.

24:54.271 --> 24:56.171
[SPEAKER_11]: I will buy one of those books at the...

24:57.071 --> 24:57.251
[SPEAKER_11]: Mad Libs

25:23.766 --> 25:24.826
[SPEAKER_01]: Mad Libs are great.

25:24.886 --> 25:25.787
[SPEAKER_01]: Mad Libs rule.

25:26.147 --> 25:27.907
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially loud Mad Libs.

25:27.927 --> 25:28.367
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

25:28.647 --> 25:39.890
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys are all sitting a bunch of seats apart, and it's all your coworkers or your friends, and everyone on the plane is really, really annoyed with you guys already, start doing some Mad Libs.

25:40.430 --> 25:41.010
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, my God.

25:41.411 --> 25:43.051
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the most fun you could possibly have.

25:43.211 --> 25:55.955
[SPEAKER_04]: But Dan, keep in mind that when I do travel, it's usually alone and I'm, unless I'm like with you, Rob and Jamie, I'm not particularly social on my method of travel.

25:56.115 --> 25:57.696
[SPEAKER_01]: Do Mad Libs with the people next to you.

25:57.896 --> 26:01.477
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do Mad Libs by yourself.

26:01.497 --> 26:03.077
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do Mad Libs by yourself.

26:03.097 --> 26:08.179
[SPEAKER_01]: Just turn to the person next to you, scary hobo, psycho killer, housewife, whatever, and say, hey.

26:08.933 --> 26:10.154
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to throw down some ad libs?

26:11.256 --> 26:13.458
[SPEAKER_01]: If they say no, sit next to someone else.

26:13.558 --> 26:14.219
[SPEAKER_11]: Excuse me, ma'am.

26:14.399 --> 26:14.740
[SPEAKER_11]: Excuse me.

26:14.780 --> 26:15.561
[SPEAKER_11]: Excuse me, ma'am.

26:15.821 --> 26:16.061
[SPEAKER_11]: Ma'am.

26:16.522 --> 26:16.722
[SPEAKER_11]: Ma'am.

26:16.882 --> 26:17.143
[SPEAKER_11]: Ma'am.

26:17.603 --> 26:17.783
[SPEAKER_11]: Ma'am.

26:18.104 --> 26:18.805
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, random bitch.

26:18.885 --> 26:19.906
[SPEAKER_01]: I need an adjective.

26:20.567 --> 26:21.488
[SPEAKER_01]: I need an adjective.

26:21.508 --> 26:22.409
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I get an adverb?

26:23.590 --> 26:24.732
[SPEAKER_11]: Can I get a proper noun?

26:25.212 --> 26:26.474
[SPEAKER_11]: Hit the call button on the flight.

26:28.456 --> 26:29.796
[SPEAKER_11]: How can they help you today?

26:30.156 --> 26:31.317
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I need a noun.

26:31.337 --> 26:35.558
[SPEAKER_03]: I need an adjective that ends in Lee.

26:36.398 --> 26:40.259
[SPEAKER_04]: And the good thing is you probably won't see any of those fuckers ever again.

26:43.040 --> 26:44.700
[SPEAKER_01]: I need a transitive verb.

26:44.800 --> 26:46.621
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you can just use whatever words that they give you.

26:47.381 --> 26:49.782
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to worry about whether they give you the right word or not.

26:50.142 --> 26:51.502
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, hey, give me a word.

26:51.842 --> 26:52.202
[SPEAKER_01]: F off.

26:52.262 --> 26:52.782
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.

26:52.842 --> 26:53.262
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.

26:53.803 --> 26:55.323
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are going to be some awesome Mad Libs.

26:59.249 --> 27:19.651
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what that has to do with games, but who cares Alright, housekeeping tonight Mad Libs is kind of a game Mad Libs are the best ever Do they have like a They should have Mad Libs on Xbox Live I was just thinking Xbox Live Arcade Mad Libs Now that 1 vs 100 is gone It should be replaced by Xbox Live Mad Libs

27:20.615 --> 27:22.356
[SPEAKER_01]: And the funnier you can make them, the more points you get.

27:22.376 --> 27:23.157
[SPEAKER_01]: Hosted by Dan.

27:23.497 --> 27:23.857
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

27:24.758 --> 27:26.099
[SPEAKER_01]: I would be better than the guy who did 1 vs. 100.

27:26.219 --> 27:28.941
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the most fun you can have with your clothes on.

27:29.441 --> 27:31.502
[SPEAKER_11]: Send in your adverb right now.

27:31.983 --> 27:32.343
[SPEAKER_11]: Do it.

27:32.723 --> 27:33.043
[SPEAKER_11]: Do it.

27:33.143 --> 27:33.684
[SPEAKER_11]: Do it.

27:33.924 --> 27:37.406
[SPEAKER_02]: You remember one time back early in the show, I tried to do a Mad Lib.

27:38.227 --> 27:38.967
[SPEAKER_04]: Mad Libs for us.

27:39.007 --> 27:40.088
[SPEAKER_11]: I think I do remember.

27:41.429 --> 27:43.070
[SPEAKER_04]: SSJ100 Matt has a good point.

27:43.350 --> 27:46.372
[SPEAKER_04]: He says, I totally want to sit between Dan and Prov on a plane.

27:47.353 --> 27:48.113
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't blame you, Matt.

27:48.374 --> 27:49.534
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that would be awkward.

27:50.996 --> 27:52.619
[SPEAKER_01]: We should do Orange Lounge Radio Mad Libs.

27:55.874 --> 27:57.054
[SPEAKER_11]: I know you got one somewhere.

27:57.094 --> 27:57.314
[SPEAKER_11]: Jamie.

28:24.142 --> 28:25.503
[SPEAKER_11]: You must find our Mad Libs book.

28:26.004 --> 28:27.185
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I found them the other day.

28:27.285 --> 28:28.946
[SPEAKER_03]: So hurry up and go to Kmart and get a new one or something.

28:28.966 --> 28:30.247
[SPEAKER_11]: We could do chat room Mad Libs.

28:30.648 --> 28:31.909
[SPEAKER_11]: Let them suggest.

28:32.009 --> 28:32.730
[SPEAKER_11]: Right, exactly.

28:33.450 --> 28:35.632
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the show where every gamer gives a noun.

28:35.892 --> 28:39.816
[SPEAKER_11]: Everybody gets their word in Mad Libs.

28:42.158 --> 28:42.678
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

28:43.859 --> 28:46.241
[SPEAKER_11]: I think our chat room is really enjoying having you on the show already.

28:46.701 --> 28:48.083
[SPEAKER_11]: Without Dan, there would not be Mad Libs.

28:48.203 --> 28:48.683
[SPEAKER_11]: It's what we do.

28:50.333 --> 28:50.994
[SPEAKER_11]: Housekeeping.

28:52.196 --> 28:56.423
[SPEAKER_03]: I deleted it!

28:58.367 --> 28:59.929
[SPEAKER_03]: I found that shit and I owned it.

29:01.138 --> 29:01.538
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

29:02.258 --> 29:02.979
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, folks.

29:03.039 --> 29:03.499
[SPEAKER_03]: Good night.

29:05.859 --> 29:06.659
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, where's my OS?

29:06.699 --> 29:07.600
[SPEAKER_03]: Empty recycle bin.

29:08.000 --> 29:09.000
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell to the yes.

29:11.281 --> 29:17.842
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone, go on your computer and look for MS008E underscore 247 dot EXE and delete that shit from me, please.

29:18.122 --> 29:20.283
[SPEAKER_01]: Her computer is going to be like, I can't do that, Jamie.

29:22.867 --> 29:24.368
[SPEAKER_11]: Housekeeping, Housekeeping, Housekeeping

29:47.725 --> 30:15.268
[SPEAKER_11]: but I'm going to be out of town next weekend so I will not be here obviously Matt is still on baby leave and Jamie, well she'll probably infect her computer or something else so she'll need to I could just do it myself just three hours of Dan Dan Radio we hate him so much there's a button that you push all you do is wait for Bobby to say push the button and then you push the button and you're live radio is so fucking easy

30:16.334 --> 30:17.355
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially Shoutcast.

30:17.395 --> 30:21.097
[SPEAKER_04]: Hell, I even ditched the Shoutcast station for a little bit.

30:21.117 --> 30:23.258
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be cool if I could do Pump Up the Volume again.

30:23.838 --> 30:24.559
[SPEAKER_11]: I won't be here.

30:24.739 --> 30:25.279
[SPEAKER_11]: That would win.

30:25.920 --> 30:28.701
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe we'll try to pre-tape this week or something.

30:28.781 --> 30:29.162
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe.

30:29.322 --> 30:31.843
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to promise that.

30:31.883 --> 30:32.163
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

30:32.403 --> 30:34.104
[SPEAKER_03]: What is one of my major pet peeves?

30:34.665 --> 30:36.326
[SPEAKER_03]: Using unnecessary prefixes.

30:38.087 --> 30:39.468
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no idea what she's talking about.

30:40.028 --> 30:41.169
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't pre-tape.

30:41.209 --> 30:42.349
[SPEAKER_03]: You just tape.

30:42.389 --> 30:43.390
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't you listen to George Carlin?

30:45.342 --> 30:45.662
[SPEAKER_11]: Shut up.

30:48.143 --> 30:52.985
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, I like having Dan on the show.

30:53.005 --> 30:55.186
[SPEAKER_03]: The moment that he says that, I start thinking of ways to kill him.

30:56.947 --> 30:58.488
[SPEAKER_11]: And I start praying for death.

30:59.388 --> 31:00.529
[SPEAKER_11]: I think I'm done apologizing.

31:00.929 --> 31:02.870
[SPEAKER_11]: Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

31:02.890 --> 31:04.830
[SPEAKER_11]: Join our Facebook.

31:07.492 --> 31:09.452
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, just so you know, it wasn't like violence.

31:09.492 --> 31:10.753
[SPEAKER_01]: I threw a Gatchaman at her.

31:12.094 --> 31:13.014
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll take a picture of it.

31:15.004 --> 31:19.309
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we even want to do gaming news tonight or should I just let the two of them go at it for three hours?

31:19.709 --> 31:22.853
[SPEAKER_11]: Welcome to our delightful marriage.

31:22.973 --> 31:24.174
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't Madden come out next week?

31:24.294 --> 31:24.655
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

31:25.340 --> 31:26.201
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck Madden!

31:27.022 --> 31:29.203
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I will agree with that totally.

31:29.224 --> 31:30.204
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck Madden.

31:30.565 --> 31:38.191
[SPEAKER_01]: If you talked to me a couple months ago and I still had a job, I would know when Madden's coming out because it would be like my whole life.

31:38.551 --> 31:40.633
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be like, oh man, I gotta get ready for Madden launch.

31:40.933 --> 31:42.835
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man, how many Madden pre-orders do I have?

31:43.295 --> 31:48.520
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that it's not my whole life, I'm just like, hey, isn't that football game coming out?

31:49.653 --> 31:50.534
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesus, who cares?

31:50.594 --> 31:51.455
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, World Cup 94.

31:51.515 --> 31:53.496
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not football.

31:53.777 --> 31:54.697
[SPEAKER_01]: Football.

31:55.198 --> 31:55.838
[SPEAKER_01]: Football.

31:59.061 --> 32:02.204
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought I saw some email about Madden Midnight Madness.

32:02.284 --> 32:04.245
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, look, this page I'm on.

32:04.305 --> 32:07.548
[SPEAKER_11]: Look, the whole time there's been this giant ad sitting there on the page I'm on.

32:08.069 --> 32:10.411
[SPEAKER_11]: Midnight launch at Walmart, August 10th.

32:10.571 --> 32:12.392
[SPEAKER_11]: So yes, Madden is out tomorrow.

32:12.552 --> 32:13.433
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm awesome at this.

32:15.149 --> 32:19.953
[SPEAKER_11]: My favorite part is that the whole time we were saying, I don't know, I don't know, it's sitting right there on the screen.

32:20.914 --> 32:23.296
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's been at Walmart, so it does not matter.

32:23.316 --> 32:25.778
[SPEAKER_01]: My screen has the Sega Genesis on it.

32:26.659 --> 32:27.279
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't do it.

32:27.719 --> 32:28.020
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

32:28.600 --> 32:29.261
[SPEAKER_08]: I regret nothing.

32:34.613 --> 32:36.714
[SPEAKER_11]: I wish I had more time to be an idiot.

32:36.734 --> 32:39.335
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes it seem like, no, I don't want to fuck Madden.

32:39.496 --> 32:41.476
[SPEAKER_03]: I want Madden to go off and get fucked.

32:42.317 --> 32:43.457
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

32:43.878 --> 32:44.278
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's the thing.

32:44.318 --> 32:45.818
[SPEAKER_04]: Preferably in a big flamey death.

32:45.838 --> 32:46.459
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's the thing.

32:46.559 --> 32:52.001
[SPEAKER_11]: I would love to go out to the midnight launches and do something for the Madden launch.

32:52.061 --> 32:52.722
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know.

32:53.062 --> 32:54.703
[SPEAKER_11]: Make fun of people who are waiting for Madden?

32:54.783 --> 32:57.364
[SPEAKER_11]: No, because look, I have friends that play Madden.

32:57.404 --> 32:57.764
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?

32:58.084 --> 33:03.871
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say, you've got to watch out for it because, honestly enough, I've done many, many midnight launches.

33:04.311 --> 33:12.341
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done Halos, I've done Grand Theft Autos, which are by far the scariest, especially San Andreas because our games are delayed like five hours.

33:12.821 --> 33:17.126
[SPEAKER_01]: But Madden's are the one midnight launch where dudes throw down and get into fights.

33:17.987 --> 33:18.347
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.

33:18.507 --> 33:22.669
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you got these people in line and you know that they're the obsessives because they get in line at like noon.

33:23.209 --> 33:25.370
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, dude, we got 700 copies.

33:25.550 --> 33:26.511
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not running out.

33:27.011 --> 33:28.791
[SPEAKER_01]: The guy's like, oh, I gotta get my Madden.

33:29.052 --> 33:29.912
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotta get that Madden.

33:30.132 --> 33:30.932
[SPEAKER_01]: Got that Madden.

33:31.372 --> 33:32.813
[SPEAKER_01]: So people are waiting for Madden.

33:34.514 --> 33:38.335
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they start having this argument about like, oh man, the Raiders, this team.

33:38.495 --> 33:39.756
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh no, this team, that team.

33:39.796 --> 33:41.276
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like about to throw down.

33:41.297 --> 33:42.217
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, guys, guys, look.

33:42.597 --> 33:43.658
[SPEAKER_01]: Football.

33:43.998 --> 33:46.380
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they like run out in the parking lot and start throwing around the football.

33:46.440 --> 33:47.381
[SPEAKER_01]: It worked really well.

33:48.301 --> 33:49.642
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I thought they were going to kill each other.

33:51.504 --> 33:52.064
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's the thing, though.

33:52.104 --> 34:00.150
[SPEAKER_11]: If I make fun of people that stand in line for Madden, then I play World of Warcraft and Dance Dance Revolution for heaven's sakes.

34:00.230 --> 34:05.954
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, you know, you can't like be a Trekkie and then look at the guy obsessed with Star Wars and call him a nerd.

34:05.994 --> 34:06.555
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I mean?

34:06.835 --> 34:07.435
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure you can.

34:09.157 --> 34:10.818
[SPEAKER_11]: It's called having a double standard.

34:14.811 --> 34:16.714
[SPEAKER_11]: It happens all the time.

34:16.814 --> 34:17.295
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

34:17.495 --> 34:21.019
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel like as a responsible gaming journalist.

34:23.342 --> 34:24.083
[SPEAKER_11]: That was funny.

34:26.528 --> 34:38.036
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like as that I shouldn't, you know, I'm not saying make bad mouth one group, you know, it's just that you're supposed to make fun of people different from you, which is in your case, everybody.

34:38.737 --> 34:41.299
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you just got to get on it.

34:41.539 --> 34:43.380
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember we were waiting for the Dreamcast, right?

34:43.440 --> 34:47.803
[SPEAKER_01]: Were you there for the whole you weren't there for that was kind of before I knew you the whole Rob time.

34:47.864 --> 34:48.344
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.

34:48.384 --> 34:51.506
[SPEAKER_01]: That's we were waiting in line for Dreamcast.

34:51.566 --> 34:55.249
[SPEAKER_01]: People were driving by and they're making fun of us and we're just making fun of them back.

34:55.549 --> 34:56.669
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was Dreamcast, not fucking Madden.

35:14.223 --> 35:14.984
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to do it.

35:15.044 --> 35:15.764
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to go out.

35:15.784 --> 35:16.485
[SPEAKER_11]: We did the Wii thing.

35:16.505 --> 35:18.226
[SPEAKER_11]: Remember we did the donuts and coffee for the Wii?

35:19.747 --> 35:20.548
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't remember that.

35:20.948 --> 35:21.709
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, you didn't go.

35:21.729 --> 35:22.369
[SPEAKER_01]: You were asleep.

35:22.549 --> 35:26.452
[SPEAKER_01]: I was sleeping because I had to go to a store the next day and sell the four Wiis that I had.

35:26.612 --> 35:27.613
[SPEAKER_03]: Still, Beanie Babies and Pokemans.

35:27.633 --> 35:31.195
[SPEAKER_03]: Kristen and I were waiting in line and we bribed them for our spot in line.

35:31.515 --> 35:36.138
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, yeah, because you got to cut to the front because there was a listener of Orange Lounge Radio.

35:36.879 --> 35:40.742
[SPEAKER_11]: Like the one listener in Sacramento happened to be at the front of the line.

35:41.622 --> 35:42.603
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever works.

35:42.623 --> 35:46.828
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great story too because Jamie says, oh yeah, me and Kristen are going to go wait in line for the Wii.

35:46.868 --> 35:48.309
[SPEAKER_01]: If I can get one, can I buy one?

35:48.329 --> 35:49.130
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, yeah, yeah.

35:49.370 --> 35:50.271
[SPEAKER_01]: You go on and do that.

35:50.331 --> 35:51.973
[SPEAKER_01]: Be sure to pick me up a copy of Zelda.

35:52.293 --> 35:55.897
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wake up the next day to go sell Wiis and I look on my couch.

35:55.917 --> 35:57.438
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a Wii sitting with a copy of Zelda.

35:57.498 --> 35:58.740
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, son of a bitch.

36:00.181 --> 36:01.202
[SPEAKER_01]: How did she do that?

36:02.664 --> 36:04.285
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called contacts.

36:05.613 --> 36:07.434
[SPEAKER_11]: I wonder if that guy still listens.

36:08.175 --> 36:12.057
[SPEAKER_03]: But as soon as Krispy Kreme opened, Kris went out and got donuts.

36:12.417 --> 36:14.358
[SPEAKER_11]: Krispy Kreme is 24 hours, darling.

36:14.559 --> 36:15.599
[SPEAKER_03]: Not that one.

36:15.959 --> 36:16.760
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't 24 hours.

36:17.200 --> 36:19.181
[SPEAKER_01]: If he does listen, thank you.

36:19.281 --> 36:22.744
[SPEAKER_01]: My wife spent $250 on a game console that I've played like three times.

36:24.845 --> 36:26.146
[SPEAKER_03]: You've played it more than that.

36:28.746 --> 36:30.287
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you going to play the new Metroid when it comes out?

36:30.788 --> 36:31.288
[SPEAKER_11]: Probably.

36:31.508 --> 36:31.748
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

36:31.768 --> 36:33.309
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you play the new Sonic when it comes out?

36:33.349 --> 36:34.170
[SPEAKER_11]: I play everything a little bit.

36:34.210 --> 36:35.111
[SPEAKER_11]: I won't play it on the Wii.

36:35.191 --> 36:35.771
[SPEAKER_11]: Sonic!

36:36.272 --> 36:36.552
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

36:37.252 --> 36:38.914
[SPEAKER_11]: Can we actually get into some gaming news now?

36:39.254 --> 36:39.674
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me see.

36:39.694 --> 36:40.855
[SPEAKER_11]: How far into the show are we tonight?

36:40.875 --> 36:41.336
[SPEAKER_03]: What if I refuse?

36:41.356 --> 36:42.316
[SPEAKER_11]: With no gaming content.

36:42.757 --> 36:43.797
[SPEAKER_11]: 37 minutes.

36:43.817 --> 36:46.039
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoever is in the chat room is OLR Recruit.

36:46.059 --> 36:48.241
[SPEAKER_03]: You got five minutes to change your nickname or I kick you.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.101
[SPEAKER_11]: I know, you're on a power trip tonight.

36:53.141 --> 36:53.802
[SPEAKER_11]: What is up with this?

36:53.982 --> 36:56.864
[SPEAKER_03]: I defeated the program, Rob.

36:57.304 --> 37:00.266
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm infringing on her territory, so she has to be Alpha Jamie.

37:02.468 --> 37:04.690
[SPEAKER_03]: My EPing is so huge right now.

37:07.412 --> 37:07.692
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.

37:10.000 --> 37:10.920
[SPEAKER_01]: So, gaming news.

37:10.940 --> 37:11.380
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

37:11.681 --> 37:12.361
[SPEAKER_11]: I got a ruler.

37:12.621 --> 37:14.521
[SPEAKER_11]: Once in a while, shove it up your ass.

37:14.602 --> 37:14.902
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

37:16.542 --> 37:16.662
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh.

37:16.742 --> 37:17.743
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, now, now, Rob.

37:17.763 --> 37:19.223
[SPEAKER_01]: See, Rob, that's not appropriate.

37:20.303 --> 37:20.904
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, now, Rob.

37:20.924 --> 37:21.304
[SPEAKER_01]: Bad.

37:21.924 --> 37:22.584
[SPEAKER_01]: Bad, Rob.

37:24.505 --> 37:30.627
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, you made the OL Army recruit cry because he or she does not know how to change their name and they're very sad.

37:31.687 --> 37:32.807
[SPEAKER_01]: What the hell was that?

37:33.108 --> 37:33.408
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

37:34.983 --> 37:36.024
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I didn't want to hang out with the customer.

37:36.044 --> 37:36.785
[SPEAKER_01]: You are walking home.

37:37.785 --> 37:38.066
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

37:38.906 --> 37:40.528
[SPEAKER_11]: Can I, can I... I somehow doubt it.

37:41.388 --> 37:44.111
[SPEAKER_11]: Can I, hello, can I, can I do the gaming news now?

37:44.211 --> 37:44.531
[SPEAKER_11]: Do it!

37:44.711 --> 37:45.392
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, hello?

37:46.112 --> 37:46.533
[SPEAKER_04]: Gaming news?

37:46.573 --> 37:47.514
[SPEAKER_04]: The hell is that?

37:47.854 --> 37:48.094
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello?

37:48.374 --> 37:49.796
[SPEAKER_11]: It's news about gaming.

37:50.898 --> 37:52.560
[SPEAKER_11]: I need a theme song for Gaming News.

37:52.881 --> 37:56.184
[SPEAKER_11]: Every other show on All Games has some theme song when they go into Gaming News.

37:56.224 --> 37:57.346
[SPEAKER_11]: We do not have a theme song.

37:58.307 --> 37:59.148
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got one for you, Rob.

37:59.188 --> 38:00.129
[SPEAKER_03]: Yakety Sax.

38:01.010 --> 38:01.931
[SPEAKER_11]: For this episode?

38:02.492 --> 38:03.272
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's Rob's theme song.

38:03.292 --> 38:03.413
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

38:08.100 --> 38:10.982
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I was supposed to be the one to bust out that app randomly.

38:11.142 --> 38:12.342
[SPEAKER_01]: Stop it right now.

38:12.422 --> 38:14.304
[SPEAKER_01]: What in the flippity fuck was that?

38:14.824 --> 38:16.025
[SPEAKER_01]: It's my Zilla app.

38:17.105 --> 38:18.226
[SPEAKER_01]: You are deleting that.

38:18.406 --> 38:21.908
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki, if you're listening, I need you to be back here.

38:22.969 --> 38:24.189
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, I know you have a baby.

38:26.010 --> 38:28.252
[SPEAKER_11]: Please come back as soon as possible.

38:28.512 --> 38:28.972
[SPEAKER_11]: I know you are.

38:28.992 --> 38:29.752
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not my fault.

38:30.393 --> 38:31.073
[SPEAKER_01]: I've segued into it.

38:31.113 --> 38:32.394
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything is your fault, Dan.

38:32.414 --> 38:32.634
[SPEAKER_01]: Sweet.

38:32.654 --> 38:32.694
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

38:37.922 --> 38:38.182
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

38:38.382 --> 38:39.443
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you can sit in her desk.

38:40.523 --> 38:44.205
[SPEAKER_03]: Dan, keep in mind, I know where you sleep.

38:45.606 --> 38:48.747
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a Dave and Buster's letter opener right here with kind of sharp edges.

38:49.347 --> 38:49.807
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of.

38:50.708 --> 38:51.348
[SPEAKER_01]: Gaming news.

38:51.388 --> 38:52.209
[SPEAKER_01]: So, gaming news.

38:54.069 --> 38:54.550
[SPEAKER_05]: Sweet.

38:59.935 --> 39:04.178
[SPEAKER_11]: Xbox Live Indie Games might not be getting Kinect.

39:05.258 --> 39:07.980
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, here's the deal.

39:08.040 --> 39:11.402
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of folks might be thinking, hey, Kinect is coming out soon.

39:11.922 --> 39:13.903
[SPEAKER_11]: Xbox Live has this whole Indie Games thing.

39:13.963 --> 39:16.105
[SPEAKER_11]: Why can't we have Kinect games on Xbox Live?

39:16.325 --> 39:17.946
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, because they don't want to let you do it.

39:18.837 --> 39:21.980
[SPEAKER_11]: Look, this is because of an interview based with Digital Spy.

39:22.600 --> 39:32.710
[SPEAKER_11]: A Microsoft spokesperson actually said that, "...only developers with established contacts and contracts with Microsoft are going to be able to make the Kinect games.

39:33.410 --> 39:38.255
[SPEAKER_11]: Only those that Microsoft actually partnered with for the launch are able to make the Kinect games."

39:39.495 --> 40:00.522
[SPEAKER_11]: they haven't said that you will never be able to make a Kinect game if you are a developer for XNA it's going to be considered for the future but nothing is actually being considered at this time so sorry there will be no Baby Maker 2000 or whatever that game is called Kinect enabled at launch it does seem to me to be the dumbest thing they could possibly do why is that?

40:01.641 --> 40:08.726
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you think about it, all the video game companies are going to be trying to do the same thing, the same way.

40:09.426 --> 40:11.067
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to try to make the Kinect work.

40:11.408 --> 40:22.535
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be some maniac out there with some indie game idea who's going to come up with the idea that makes the Kinect the must-have object that people will pay $150 for.

40:22.575 --> 40:25.657
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the thing is already $60 overpriced.

40:27.238 --> 40:28.159
[SPEAKER_01]: They're killing it.

40:28.419 --> 40:29.460
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just killing it.

40:30.876 --> 40:34.137
[SPEAKER_11]: It's killing its chances of becoming the next big thing.

40:34.257 --> 40:37.118
[SPEAKER_11]: Dan, I gotta admit, Dance Central is pretty awesome.

40:37.338 --> 40:39.159
[SPEAKER_11]: You know you wanna play Dance Central.

40:39.179 --> 40:40.840
[SPEAKER_11]: Dan, are you gonna dance to Poker Face?

40:40.920 --> 40:41.340
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably not.

40:42.360 --> 40:44.741
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying that the Kinect is not a great idea.

40:46.482 --> 40:47.822
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe in the Kinect.

40:47.862 --> 40:50.103
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe in the demonstrations I've seen.

40:50.423 --> 40:52.164
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the technology's amazing.

40:52.544 --> 40:59.727
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad to see that somebody is getting on it and that it's not, you know, Sony's pathetic Wii controller rip-off.

41:00.441 --> 41:06.044
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, I just think, from a retailer's perspective, they're charging too much for it.

41:07.505 --> 41:11.308
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just don't see it doing anything different yet.

41:11.568 --> 41:25.976
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if something comes out with the interactivity of the Milo program and a great game is built around it and you can stand around and play that game...

41:26.997 --> 41:34.402
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll sell some Kinect, sure, but you need something that, you know, like the Wii Bowling thing that got everyone to believe in the Wii.

41:34.782 --> 41:36.963
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything on the Wii was, oh, wow, that's kind of cool, that's kind of cool.

41:37.223 --> 41:38.224
[SPEAKER_01]: Wii Bowling's amazing!

41:38.284 --> 41:39.645
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like bowling in real life!

41:40.065 --> 41:42.186
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Kinect doesn't have that program.

41:43.667 --> 41:46.509
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you're not going to mainstream people with Dance Central.

41:46.749 --> 41:49.331
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, even though it's by Harmonix and it's a great game for Rob.

41:51.873 --> 42:14.893
[SPEAKER_01]: for me well because to you no you know that's the kind of thing that you're into that's the kind of thing that you love for me I was never really into the music rhythm games except for Guitar Hero and you know Guitar Freaks and whatnot well of course you're gonna want it too well maybe that way I have to spend the money on it maybe there will be like a Red Dead Redemption part two where you can actually choke a bitch sure exactly

42:15.794 --> 42:16.794
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

42:43.917 --> 42:44.358
[SPEAKER_11]: Even better.

42:44.618 --> 42:47.420
[SPEAKER_11]: Could you do that lasso motion one more time in studio, Dan, for us?

42:47.460 --> 42:48.621
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm pretty sure I'm going to pass on that.

42:48.661 --> 42:50.803
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's do the lasso motion one more.

42:50.903 --> 42:51.404
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, darn it.

42:52.865 --> 42:54.847
[SPEAKER_11]: I screwed on the thing I was trying to do.

42:55.627 --> 42:57.689
[SPEAKER_11]: I was going to give Dan some music to do his lassoing, too.

42:58.150 --> 42:59.891
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I'm going to do some poker face.

43:00.231 --> 43:01.172
[SPEAKER_01]: Ma-ma-ma-ma.

43:04.039 --> 43:04.639
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on, Dan!

43:04.819 --> 43:05.799
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it on YouTube?

43:06.240 --> 43:07.300
[SPEAKER_01]: Swing that hand, Dan!

43:07.680 --> 43:08.500
[SPEAKER_01]: That's classy.

43:08.720 --> 43:09.880
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything is on YouTube.

43:10.861 --> 43:11.281
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

43:11.461 --> 43:12.821
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the piano version of that song.

43:12.861 --> 43:14.842
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the Cartman version.

43:16.242 --> 43:17.862
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even know how I got into Just Dance.

43:17.882 --> 43:18.762
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a Cartman version?

43:18.782 --> 43:19.663
[SPEAKER_03]: Why am I not surprised?

43:19.803 --> 43:23.964
[SPEAKER_11]: Other comments from our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com Let's see.

43:24.364 --> 43:29.005
[SPEAKER_11]: SSJ100Matt says that our good buddy and indie developer YYR is pissed about this.

43:29.645 --> 43:33.166
[SPEAKER_11]: He was gonna make Killer Wheelchair Golden Girls game using Kinect.

43:34.366 --> 43:36.969
[SPEAKER_11]: Right, but they don't... I mean, they still have ultimate control over what release is.

43:55.439 --> 44:02.364
[SPEAKER_11]: XNA is a little different because it's all community-based.

44:03.085 --> 44:08.369
[SPEAKER_11]: Microsoft, per se, yes, they have ultimate control over it, but they don't really babysit it.

44:08.709 --> 44:10.370
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all community-driven.

44:10.410 --> 44:13.693
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the difference between it being controlled by your controller and controlled by Kinect?

44:14.093 --> 44:17.436
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's probably a technical problem.

44:18.325 --> 44:20.926
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, surely you have something you want to share with us tonight

44:38.874 --> 44:39.935
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's about the move.

44:40.455 --> 44:41.075
[SPEAKER_03]: The move.

44:42.556 --> 44:44.036
[SPEAKER_03]: Ha ha ha, Sony.

44:45.637 --> 44:50.339
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they are not going to have just a kiosk for showing the move.

44:50.359 --> 44:55.382
[SPEAKER_03]: They're actually hiring reps, Sony is, to teach people how to use the move in person.

44:56.302 --> 44:57.743
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, is it that complex?

44:58.163 --> 44:59.263
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it that big of a deal?

44:59.944 --> 45:02.385
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and the reps are all training on Nintendo Wii's.

45:03.393 --> 45:13.686
[SPEAKER_03]: But they are going to be giving seven hours of move training to people who already have a base knowledge of Sony consoles.

45:15.067 --> 45:16.409
[SPEAKER_03]: And the competition.

45:18.512 --> 45:21.575
[SPEAKER_03]: And speaking of stupid, they're actually coming out...

45:23.885 --> 45:24.145
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

45:26.866 --> 45:28.387
[SPEAKER_01]: And speaking of stupid.

45:28.747 --> 45:29.547
[SPEAKER_01]: It was stupid.

45:29.647 --> 45:30.427
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't stop.

45:30.707 --> 45:37.130
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, anyway, speaking of stupid, there's actually accessories that are going to be out with the move, like gloves.

45:38.270 --> 45:39.991
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, they are gloves.

45:40.711 --> 45:46.993
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can secure the move thing to the glove so that you don't drop it.

45:48.173 --> 45:49.874
[SPEAKER_11]: What else can you secure to the glove?

45:50.353 --> 45:51.254
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably a cock.

45:53.036 --> 45:53.257
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

45:53.577 --> 45:59.445
[SPEAKER_03]: It is kind of... Well, the move is kind of wide like a good dildo, so maybe you could put a vibrator in there.

45:59.465 --> 46:02.228
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

46:03.550 --> 46:05.152
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my wife, ladies and gentlemen!

46:06.954 --> 46:07.354
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

46:07.775 --> 46:08.435
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just saying.

46:08.495 --> 46:09.555
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm using my imagination.

46:09.576 --> 46:11.517
[SPEAKER_03]: You said what else could go in there that would be useful.

46:11.657 --> 46:14.178
[SPEAKER_11]: Joe Digitech in our chatroom is calling them love gloves.

46:15.119 --> 46:16.039
[SPEAKER_03]: Cucumbers, Rob.

46:17.580 --> 46:19.581
[SPEAKER_03]: What if you're really, really hungry?

46:20.041 --> 46:20.582
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, get this.

46:20.622 --> 46:28.166
[SPEAKER_03]: What if you're really, really hungry and you're playing your move and you don't really want to have to let go of your cucumber to play it?

46:28.246 --> 46:30.507
[SPEAKER_01]: Will it be cross-compatible with Nintendo Wii?

46:30.667 --> 46:31.768
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it a bumpy cucumber?

46:32.128 --> 46:33.969
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet you can use it with a Wiimote.

46:35.130 --> 46:35.790
[SPEAKER_01]: Classic.

46:38.299 --> 46:40.220
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys can use them on your microphones.

46:40.460 --> 46:41.861
[SPEAKER_01]: That's true.

46:41.901 --> 46:50.066
[SPEAKER_03]: We can use them on our microphones so that we don't drop them because we're too... I guess maybe we don't have the fine motor control or brain power to understand.

46:50.426 --> 46:51.087
[SPEAKER_03]: Open hand.

46:51.307 --> 46:52.267
[SPEAKER_03]: Insert object.

46:52.407 --> 46:53.088
[SPEAKER_03]: Close hand.

46:53.468 --> 46:54.249
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold tightly.

46:55.109 --> 46:55.449
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe?

46:55.749 --> 47:01.173
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if you're going to release an accessory that's so complex that you need to train people to train people.

47:01.413 --> 47:02.153
[SPEAKER_01]: For seven hours.

47:02.173 --> 47:04.214
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to pay people to train people how to use it.

47:04.334 --> 47:05.435
[SPEAKER_02]: For seven hours of training.

47:05.455 --> 47:06.295
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, but to be fair.

47:06.536 --> 47:06.996
[SPEAKER_11]: To be fair.

47:07.036 --> 47:07.456
[SPEAKER_11]: To be fair.

47:07.556 --> 47:07.976
[SPEAKER_11]: Fair or down?

47:08.236 --> 47:08.437
[SPEAKER_11]: Fair.

47:08.617 --> 47:09.077
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's be fair.

47:09.257 --> 47:09.517
[SPEAKER_11]: We're fair.

47:09.737 --> 47:13.920
[SPEAKER_11]: A couple weeks ago on the show, we talked about Kinect doing demos at Macy's.

47:15.282 --> 47:21.950
[SPEAKER_11]: So they are also sending people out to teach them how to use Kinect, which really involves just flailing.

47:22.310 --> 47:24.392
[SPEAKER_11]: There isn't even a controller to use.

47:24.432 --> 47:30.639
[SPEAKER_11]: No gloves, no cucumbers, just you and your cucumber.

47:30.659 --> 47:32.101
[SPEAKER_11]: They didn't train anyone how to use iToy.

47:33.302 --> 47:33.523
[SPEAKER_11]: Well...

47:34.784 --> 47:35.745
[SPEAKER_11]: and we saw how that went.

47:35.965 --> 47:36.486
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

47:36.686 --> 47:40.631
[SPEAKER_11]: All they needed to do was to get the window washing game out there in Macy's and it was sold like crazy.

47:40.651 --> 47:45.076
[SPEAKER_01]: That little game where you were like the ninja and you were like or the standing on the screen and you're hitting all the little ninjas.

47:45.236 --> 47:45.917
[SPEAKER_01]: That was pretty fun.

47:46.357 --> 47:50.081
[SPEAKER_03]: So now I guess it is now people decide to abuse Kinect.

47:50.502 --> 47:53.385
[SPEAKER_03]: They say well we have people out there teaching them how to use it right.

47:54.346 --> 47:56.267
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not our fault, we showed them how to do it.

48:14.817 --> 48:16.117
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you need help using the ATM?

48:16.157 --> 48:17.158
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd be like, get the fuck out of here.

48:17.178 --> 48:18.138
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want you seeing my pin.

48:18.578 --> 48:20.559
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, I wasn't using the ATM.

48:20.599 --> 48:23.319
[SPEAKER_01]: I was taking my deposit to the bank, you know, when I was working at the store.

48:23.499 --> 48:26.120
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you know that the new ATMs will actually take your deposits?

48:26.220 --> 48:28.801
[SPEAKER_01]: We would make fun of the ATM ambassador every morning.

48:31.142 --> 48:32.502
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think he liked me very much.

48:32.862 --> 48:36.223
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but it was a job.

48:36.623 --> 48:37.823
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a job.

48:37.983 --> 48:43.505
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkTetsuya in our chatroom is suggesting that as far as his glove goes, you can get a glittery one for the new Michael Jackson game.

48:44.605 --> 48:44.985
[SPEAKER_04]: Woo!

48:45.626 --> 48:46.626
[SPEAKER_03]: Dot, dot, dot.

48:47.327 --> 48:50.108
[SPEAKER_03]: These actually look... They're padded.

48:50.168 --> 48:53.190
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it just so that you don't accidentally punch yourself in the face or something, too?

48:54.031 --> 48:56.192
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to put the picture of this in the chat room.

48:56.252 --> 48:57.533
[SPEAKER_01]: The new move helmet.

49:00.895 --> 49:03.556
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't forget about the crayons that come as a pack-in snack.

49:06.943 --> 49:07.303
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, look, look.

49:35.354 --> 49:46.142
[SPEAKER_11]: Back in the day, in Nintendo Power, like 6th or 7th issue, they actually profiled a real-life video game that existed in Vacaville, California, and it was called The Woos.

49:46.182 --> 49:46.482
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

49:46.682 --> 49:49.204
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was The Maze, and that's what Dan's referring to.

49:49.224 --> 49:50.545
[SPEAKER_01]: That was in Nintendo Power, huh?

49:50.625 --> 49:51.406
[SPEAKER_01]: It was in Nintendo Power.

49:51.426 --> 49:52.647
[SPEAKER_11]: The Nintendo Power was awesome.

49:54.228 --> 49:54.948
[SPEAKER_11]: 20 years ago, yes.

49:55.168 --> 49:55.689
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.

49:55.749 --> 49:56.529
[SPEAKER_11]: Or whenever it started.

49:56.549 --> 49:59.191
[SPEAKER_01]: Back when Nintendo Power started, it was amazing.

50:00.152 --> 50:03.114
[SPEAKER_01]: And then GamePro came out, and we all made fun of it because it wasn't as good as Nintendo Power.

50:03.154 --> 50:04.095
[SPEAKER_03]: The Woos Vacaville.

50:05.623 --> 50:07.845
[SPEAKER_11]: I was on Team GamePro or whatever it was called.

50:07.885 --> 50:09.026
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a website up.

50:09.126 --> 50:13.069
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it was like you had to write an essay and they picked 250 people to be in their little club.

50:13.370 --> 50:15.251
[SPEAKER_11]: And do you know what we did once we were in the club?

50:16.192 --> 50:16.592
[SPEAKER_11]: Nothing.

50:17.033 --> 50:17.313
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

50:17.793 --> 50:18.674
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's like I won.

50:18.694 --> 50:22.858
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't even remember what I wrote my essay on, but yeah, it was a long time ago.

50:23.699 --> 50:24.980
[SPEAKER_11]: But sadly, the Wooz is long gone.

50:25.000 --> 50:25.880
[SPEAKER_11]: They bulldozed the Wooz.

50:25.900 --> 50:26.501
[SPEAKER_01]: Way gone.

50:26.621 --> 50:27.422
[SPEAKER_11]: What's there now?

50:27.722 --> 50:28.643
[SPEAKER_03]: A car dealership.

50:28.823 --> 50:31.185
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it a car dealership or is it like an outlet mall?

50:32.734 --> 50:34.256
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm pretty sure that's where they built the outlets.

50:48.752 --> 50:49.773
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, this is kind of funny.

50:49.813 --> 50:53.277
[SPEAKER_03]: I found a blog about it with an aerial view.

50:53.657 --> 50:57.241
[SPEAKER_11]: It probably was the same aerial view that was in Nintendo Power years ago because they would actually show it.

50:57.261 --> 50:59.083
[SPEAKER_11]: They would actually change the configuration every few months.

50:59.103 --> 50:59.724
[SPEAKER_03]: I love how this starts.

51:00.084 --> 51:01.666
[SPEAKER_03]: Back in the late 80s, things sucked.

51:02.086 --> 51:02.767
[SPEAKER_03]: The music sucked.

51:02.967 --> 51:03.628
[SPEAKER_03]: The movies sucked.

51:03.928 --> 51:05.209
[SPEAKER_03]: The entertainment slash things to do sucked.

51:05.230 --> 51:06.411
[SPEAKER_11]: What the fuck are they smoking?

51:06.471 --> 51:08.613
[SPEAKER_11]: Back in the late 80s, the movies rocked.

51:08.633 --> 51:09.995
[SPEAKER_11]: We had hella arcades then.

51:10.515 --> 51:12.596
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell, author?

51:12.656 --> 51:15.398
[SPEAKER_03]: This person apparently is pooping on the woos.

51:15.438 --> 51:17.320
[SPEAKER_11]: Was born in 1991, so kiss my ass.

51:17.400 --> 51:18.881
[SPEAKER_11]: That person sucks.

51:18.941 --> 51:19.981
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, what's next?

51:23.464 --> 51:25.125
[SPEAKER_01]: The Princess Bride did not suck.

51:25.165 --> 51:25.605
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you!

51:25.905 --> 51:27.806
[SPEAKER_11]: Mystique came in and said, hey, hey.

51:27.906 --> 51:29.527
[SPEAKER_09]: The Princess Bride does not suck.

51:29.628 --> 51:30.868
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't even know what you're talking about.

51:30.888 --> 51:32.009
[SPEAKER_11]: Because the Princess Bride was like 87, 88.

51:33.669 --> 51:33.909
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

51:34.570 --> 51:40.739
[SPEAKER_11]: And this guy says that there were no good movies in the late 80s and therefore Mystique has just made a logic.

51:41.480 --> 51:42.782
[SPEAKER_11]: She's done a logic thing.

51:43.263 --> 51:44.505
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, anything can happen once.

51:44.525 --> 51:47.068
[SPEAKER_03]: It's inconceivable.

51:48.390 --> 51:50.153
[SPEAKER_03]: I do not think that word means what you think it means.

51:52.560 --> 51:53.141
[SPEAKER_11]: My head hurts.

51:54.342 --> 51:56.444
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's talk about NBA Elite 11.

51:57.085 --> 51:58.506
[SPEAKER_11]: It comes with NBA Jam.

51:58.887 --> 51:59.447
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Dan.

51:59.487 --> 52:00.428
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what I was going to report.

52:00.448 --> 52:01.509
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a scam.

52:02.070 --> 52:08.617
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a scam because I have no interest in NBA Elite 11, but I want NBA Jam with a burning, fiery passion.

52:09.198 --> 52:11.320
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't want to pay 60 bucks for it.

52:12.441 --> 52:12.901
[SPEAKER_04]: Burning, huh?

52:13.702 --> 52:13.942
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

52:14.522 --> 52:18.323
[SPEAKER_11]: So just pretend you didn't hear that and I'm going to report this news you've never heard before.

52:19.263 --> 52:26.165
[SPEAKER_11]: NBA Elite 11 will have a one-time download code that will let you access three modes of NBA Jam.

52:26.185 --> 52:28.386
[SPEAKER_11]: Play Now, Classic Campaign, and Online.

52:28.706 --> 52:31.367
[SPEAKER_11]: This would explain why we saw ESRB ratings last week.

52:32.367 --> 52:35.228
[SPEAKER_11]: They are not selling these separately, at least for now.

52:35.608 --> 52:36.628
[SPEAKER_11]: My gut tells me...

52:37.228 --> 52:38.509
[SPEAKER_11]: Where there's money to be made.

52:39.070 --> 52:42.893
[SPEAKER_11]: This is how it's going to work for like two months or three months, and then it'll be out for everybody.

52:42.913 --> 52:45.615
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, sure, it's EA, and EA is all about the money.

52:45.875 --> 53:00.288
[SPEAKER_01]: But, oh man, for people like me, who are idiots, who have been dying for NBA Jam, either I gotta pay 50 bucks to get it on the Wii, or I gotta pay 60 bucks to get it on the 360, rather than paying the 15 bucks, which I would be totally willing to pay to get it on the 360.

53:00.328 --> 53:00.488
[SPEAKER_01]: Because...

53:03.131 --> 53:07.628
[SPEAKER_01]: I love NBA Jam I don't like sports games, but I love NBA Jam

53:08.829 --> 53:32.900
[SPEAKER_11]: Shaka, Laka I am in your court I made a basketball joke That was awesome I hate you so much I don't like a lot of sports games either but I love NBA Jam, Double Dribble Blades of Steel Blades of Steel is sweet It's like the best game Konami ever made I like the fact that you can play Gradius at halftime I know, right?

53:33.060 --> 53:34.401
[SPEAKER_11]: Awesome

53:36.442 --> 53:40.564
[SPEAKER_11]: Sports games aren't always missable for me.

53:40.584 --> 53:41.805
[SPEAKER_11]: There's some that you have to have.

53:42.125 --> 53:43.145
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm kind of in the same court as you.

53:43.165 --> 53:44.266
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to put the fun in.

53:44.426 --> 53:47.448
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're fun, you will play them.

53:47.987 --> 53:49.989
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

54:12.825 --> 54:14.145
[SPEAKER_03]: and Bill Clinton.

54:14.165 --> 54:17.226
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the first revision of NBA Jam Tournament Edition.

54:17.526 --> 54:18.066
[SPEAKER_11]: Hold on though.

54:18.086 --> 54:19.527
[SPEAKER_11]: We can do that on MAME.

54:19.727 --> 54:29.309
[SPEAKER_11]: The way of looking at it that you just said, Dan, is that I can pay $50 to have it on the Wii or I could just wait and pay $15 for it on the Xbox 360 but that's assuming it would be $15.

54:30.710 --> 54:33.450
[SPEAKER_11]: What if EA knows they have a premium game here?

54:33.950 --> 54:39.532
[SPEAKER_11]: What if you were looking at it as I'm paying $60 for NBA Jam and getting some other basketball game for free?

54:39.632 --> 54:40.352
[SPEAKER_11]: That's pretty graphics.

54:40.532 --> 54:44.594
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, if it was a full release, because the thing is I'll never play NBA Elite 11.

54:45.014 --> 54:45.694
[SPEAKER_01]: I just never will.

54:45.714 --> 54:46.294
[SPEAKER_01]: Not even once?

54:46.574 --> 54:47.175
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably not.

54:47.275 --> 54:47.535
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

54:47.935 --> 54:58.419
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I've played NBA Live, I've played NBA 2K, you know, and honestly, in this race, my horse is definitely 2K.

54:58.879 --> 55:00.320
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just better.

55:00.440 --> 55:01.960
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I understand everyone out there.

55:02.521 --> 55:04.421
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, NBA, EA Sports, whatever.

55:04.561 --> 55:07.763
[SPEAKER_01]: NBA Live has just been atrocious since like 2005.

55:09.704 --> 55:11.985
[SPEAKER_01]: But NBA Jam... Hence why it's now NBA Elite.

55:12.605 --> 55:13.026
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

55:13.046 --> 55:15.947
[SPEAKER_01]: They finally said, okay, we're tired of getting our asses kicked by 2K.

55:16.267 --> 55:17.167
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to change the name.

55:17.188 --> 55:18.008
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to change the game.

55:18.028 --> 55:20.669
[SPEAKER_01]: And then 2K's like, Jordan, motherfuckers!

55:21.109 --> 55:23.450
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Elite was like, screw!

55:23.811 --> 55:24.651
[SPEAKER_01]: This sucks!

55:25.792 --> 55:27.152
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll put NBA Jam with it!

55:27.212 --> 55:29.013
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just like, oh, touche.

55:29.353 --> 55:30.374
[SPEAKER_01]: Touche EA.

55:30.534 --> 55:31.434
[SPEAKER_01]: Very well played.

55:31.954 --> 55:32.735
[SPEAKER_02]: A2 EA?

55:33.155 --> 55:33.835
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, whatever.

55:34.616 --> 55:36.477
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I want NBA Jam bad.

55:38.004 --> 55:39.765
[SPEAKER_11]: TigerClaw in our chatroom says, think about it.

55:39.845 --> 55:44.467
[SPEAKER_11]: If NBA Jam had online, we can try to represent the OL Army in the Big Battle sometime in the future.

55:45.368 --> 55:48.389
[SPEAKER_11]: Completely forgot to mention Big Battle during housekeeping because I got derailed.

55:48.409 --> 55:49.370
[SPEAKER_11]: Something about Mad Libs.

55:49.450 --> 55:50.690
[SPEAKER_11]: Mad Libs!

55:50.730 --> 55:55.353
[SPEAKER_11]: Something that the listeners have been asking for for forever is coming to the Big Battle.

55:56.033 --> 55:56.714
[SPEAKER_11]: A music game.

55:56.814 --> 55:57.154
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right.

55:57.174 --> 55:58.915
[SPEAKER_11]: Guitar Hero 5 is now in the Big Battle.

55:58.955 --> 55:59.355
[SPEAKER_00]: Check it out.

55:59.715 --> 56:00.896
[SPEAKER_11]: TheBigBattle.net.

56:01.676 --> 56:02.016
[SPEAKER_11]: There you go.

56:02.276 --> 56:08.720
[SPEAKER_11]: And if OLR doesn't win the music game competition, I don't, like, really?

56:08.820 --> 56:09.120
[SPEAKER_11]: Really?

56:09.621 --> 56:10.761
[SPEAKER_11]: I will disown all of you.

56:10.781 --> 56:11.202
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I'm kidding.

56:11.542 --> 56:18.466
[SPEAKER_01]: I think my solution is if somebody is buying NBA Elite and doesn't care about NBA Jam, I will buy their download code from them.

56:19.827 --> 56:21.088
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to find that person.

56:22.348 --> 56:23.369
[SPEAKER_01]: You're killing me with this, Rob.

56:23.820 --> 56:26.562
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm not going to buy it all special and shit.

56:27.602 --> 56:29.343
[SPEAKER_11]: See, I'm looking at it this way.

56:30.063 --> 56:46.693
[SPEAKER_11]: What if instead of looking at it as I'm buying this game and getting ripped off with this game I don't even want, what if NBA Jam on the Wii cost me $50, I could pay $10 more to get it on the 360, which is pretty much what most premium usually is.

56:46.993 --> 56:48.634
[SPEAKER_11]: You have to look at it the other way around.

56:50.330 --> 56:58.655
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, sure, I want it to come out for $15 too, but, you know, think about how the Wii folks would be in an uproar if it was like, well, it's $15 there, but you're going to charge me $50?

56:58.755 --> 56:59.896
[SPEAKER_11]: F you.

57:00.956 --> 57:02.257
[SPEAKER_01]: The Wii version gets extra boats.

57:03.427 --> 57:03.607
[SPEAKER_11]: NBA Jam

57:26.624 --> 57:43.934
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Maxx portable 3 has some new features it's and keep in mind this is not a game that I have really played much if any of but they have a three-track remixing system that's made just for that particular version

57:46.556 --> 58:02.997
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, I was watching the video of it while you were going off on, um, NBA whatever And, um, but they're saying that, um, that it's supposed to actually be a completely revamped system It looks kinda neat

58:03.444 --> 58:05.625
[SPEAKER_11]: Did they put a mode in the game that will make it fun?

58:06.705 --> 58:31.612
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm kidding, I'm kidding, DJ Max is fine DJ Max is, it's Beatmania 2DX with buttons on your PSP And it's fine, I'm just giving it a hard time I just wanted like, some of the DJ Max fans to sit there and The music is actually sounding kind of cool The music's neat This is great radio, we're just sitting here I don't know what that is, but that gave me a headache Ah, creepy girl with no eyes Alright

58:32.941 --> 58:33.321
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

58:33.761 --> 58:38.202
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm glad they're putting in some new modes and some new ideas so it doesn't just feel like a 2DX port.

58:38.282 --> 58:39.262
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of cool.

58:39.282 --> 58:41.503
[SPEAKER_11]: And to be fair, they have had some other stuff.

58:41.523 --> 58:46.424
[SPEAKER_11]: They do a three-button mode, a six-button mode, a eleventy-billion-button mode.

58:46.704 --> 58:49.645
[SPEAKER_11]: They do all these different modes and tricks with it.

58:49.685 --> 58:52.525
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody else's PSP mode, somebody's Wii mode.

58:53.565 --> 58:55.586
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to see 2DX on the PSP.

58:56.226 --> 58:57.786
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to see 2DX on the PS3.

58:58.246 --> 59:00.927
[SPEAKER_01]: With the Konami-style 2DX PSP controller.

59:01.427 --> 59:05.350
[SPEAKER_11]: Where is my PlayStation 3 version of 2DX?

59:05.451 --> 59:06.411
[SPEAKER_11]: Why has that not come out yet?

59:06.431 --> 59:08.293
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought 2DX was over.

59:09.194 --> 59:10.735
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's still going in the arcades in Japan.

59:10.755 --> 59:13.137
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I thought that they actually did a final version.

59:13.317 --> 59:14.978
[SPEAKER_11]: They did a final Beatmania.

59:15.719 --> 59:20.803
[SPEAKER_11]: They did Beatmania 1 final, they did Beatmania 3 final, but they never did a Beatmania 2 deluxe final.

59:21.724 --> 59:22.144
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.

59:22.184 --> 59:22.945
[SPEAKER_11]: That's still going.

59:22.965 --> 59:25.326
[SPEAKER_11]: They're on like... 98th style.

59:25.346 --> 59:26.207
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

59:26.247 --> 59:28.069
[SPEAKER_11]: They're on like 18th or 19th style.

59:28.229 --> 59:28.589
[SPEAKER_11]: They're a lot.

59:30.010 --> 59:32.131
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it proved popular and has longevity.

59:33.412 --> 59:33.932
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a neat game.

59:33.952 --> 59:35.693
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because that arcade machine is amazing.

59:35.713 --> 59:39.035
[SPEAKER_03]: The next one's going to be with remix mode or some shit in it.

59:39.195 --> 59:39.856
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so good.

59:40.916 --> 59:45.019
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, if you like these DJ games, maybe DJ Hero 2 is something you're interested in.

59:45.119 --> 59:45.999
[SPEAKER_11]: I know I am, actually.

59:46.039 --> 59:47.860
[SPEAKER_11]: The first DJ Hero game was really underrated.

59:47.920 --> 59:49.081
[SPEAKER_11]: Why are you laughing at me?

59:49.461 --> 59:52.183
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you told me I was going to jump in and say, but probably not.

59:53.601 --> 59:56.462
[SPEAKER_11]: No, DJ Hero 2 is going to have, of course, the multiplayer mode.

59:56.482 --> 01:00:01.384
[SPEAKER_11]: And DJ Hero 1 had that too, but one thing that was missing when you would play online is rewind.

01:00:01.764 --> 01:00:02.204
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right.

01:00:02.344 --> 01:00:04.805
[SPEAKER_11]: Now you can rewind in multiplayer mode.

01:00:05.085 --> 01:00:07.706
[SPEAKER_11]: You couldn't do that before, but now you're actually going to get to rewind.

01:00:08.006 --> 01:00:14.028
[SPEAKER_11]: So once you get enough power in the multiplayer mode, you're going to be able to spin the thing backwards, and you rewind the track and get more points.

01:00:14.568 --> 01:00:16.469
[SPEAKER_11]: So in DJ Hero 2, this will be in there.

01:00:16.869 --> 01:00:21.871
[SPEAKER_11]: And what happens is that while you rewind, your opponent gets to do nothing while you rack up the points.

01:00:22.111 --> 01:00:22.711
[SPEAKER_11]: Hee hee!

01:00:23.271 --> 01:00:24.051
[SPEAKER_11]: So that'll be kind of fun.

01:00:24.471 --> 01:00:25.752
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's gonna get pretty ugly.

01:00:28.093 --> 01:00:31.274
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just looking forward to the rapping in it and how that'll play out online.

01:00:31.394 --> 01:00:35.595
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, Dan, I would love to do some DJ Hero where I will do the DJ and you do the rapping.

01:00:35.875 --> 01:00:36.576
[SPEAKER_11]: Wouldn't that be fun?

01:00:38.797 --> 01:00:39.437
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what we need?

01:00:39.457 --> 01:00:40.357
[SPEAKER_11]: I would throw down.

01:00:40.397 --> 01:00:42.558
[SPEAKER_11]: We need Dan playing a Def Jam rap star.

01:00:42.998 --> 01:00:43.799
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:01:02.340 --> 01:01:25.191
[SPEAKER_11]: They had Def Jam Rapstar sitting next to Glee Karaoke Revolution And I will tell you what Def Jam Rapstar popped a cap in Glee's ass so fast It's not even funny because the Glee game was terrible Of course it did Well, first of all, anything that Konami I mean, I hate to say this because I have great love for Konami But anything that Konami does these days is pretty bad

01:01:26.041 --> 01:01:27.402
[SPEAKER_11]: Dance Masters looks interesting.

01:01:27.542 --> 01:01:31.124
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the first really, really interesting music game I've seen from them in a while.

01:01:31.164 --> 01:01:33.025
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows, but the budget's gone.

01:01:33.085 --> 01:01:36.307
[SPEAKER_01]: Konami is not into gaming like they were.

01:01:36.427 --> 01:01:42.591
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just not a lot of... Well, they closed one of their offices that was a huge part of it.

01:01:42.611 --> 01:01:43.511
[SPEAKER_01]: They closed a lot of it.

01:01:43.571 --> 01:01:45.632
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, a lot of Konami is just history.

01:01:46.053 --> 01:01:47.513
[SPEAKER_01]: All the good talent is gone.

01:01:48.914 --> 01:01:52.937
[SPEAKER_01]: They're basically outsourcing their franchises to make some money, but...

01:01:53.857 --> 01:01:58.819
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, anything that Konami does is, you know, pretty cut right these days.

01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:01.921
[SPEAKER_11]: Not to get off topic, but what do you think of that Castlevania game that's coming out?

01:02:01.961 --> 01:02:03.962
[SPEAKER_11]: The Castlevania God of War thing.

01:02:04.890 --> 01:02:07.311
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hopefully going to be okay.

01:02:07.431 --> 01:02:12.213
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Castlevania in 3D is pretty miss and miss.

01:02:12.333 --> 01:02:17.455
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that Lament of Innocence and Curse of Darkness was the other one.

01:02:17.475 --> 01:02:17.975
[SPEAKER_01]: I think so, yeah.

01:02:18.095 --> 01:02:24.017
[SPEAKER_01]: Those weren't the worst 3D action games to ever happen, but they weren't the quality of what you'd consider Castlevania.

01:02:24.537 --> 01:02:26.998
[SPEAKER_01]: The new one looks really good.

01:02:27.538 --> 01:02:37.021
[SPEAKER_01]: They say they got Kojima on it, and you know, Kojima's kind of Konami's only superstar that's really left So, if it's awesome, great!

01:02:37.841 --> 01:02:50.545
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't know, I just don't have a lot of, you know, hope for 3D Castlevania If I play it and I like it, I'm gonna be pleasantly surprised If you like God of War, I think you'll like it, it's very pretty It's much sexier

01:02:50.865 --> 01:02:51.726
[SPEAKER_11]: I love Symphony of the Night

01:03:11.109 --> 01:03:19.894
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they're all building off of that formula and, you know, they're all, all the 2D ones are, you know, they're all portables and, you know, they lose points for that.

01:03:20.875 --> 01:03:22.576
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, not that they're bad, but yeah.

01:03:22.596 --> 01:03:24.597
[SPEAKER_03]: I really liked Portrait of Ruin when I got through it.

01:03:24.917 --> 01:03:25.998
[SPEAKER_01]: Portrait of Ruin was a great game.

01:03:27.399 --> 01:03:27.839
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, let's see.

01:03:27.879 --> 01:03:32.682
[SPEAKER_11]: Salacious Pop in our chat room says, Konami only seems to burp up new flavors of Castlevania and Silent Hill.

01:03:32.722 --> 01:03:34.523
[SPEAKER_11]: What was their last really new IP?

01:03:35.463 --> 01:03:36.504
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, Saw?

01:03:36.924 --> 01:03:38.405
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

01:03:41.764 --> 01:03:42.024
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

01:03:42.304 --> 01:03:43.285
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm actually trying to think.

01:03:44.645 --> 01:03:46.826
[SPEAKER_11]: SSJ100, Matt is still waiting on a new Zone of Enders game.

01:03:47.066 --> 01:03:52.167
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody who came into the store and saw there was a Saw game, everybody was like, there's a Saw game?

01:03:53.268 --> 01:03:53.968
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it any good?

01:03:53.988 --> 01:03:55.188
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

01:03:55.248 --> 01:03:56.129
[SPEAKER_01]: No one's ever played it.

01:03:57.409 --> 01:04:02.091
[SPEAKER_11]: I've heard from people that can stomach those kind of games that it's actually not as bad as you'd think.

01:04:02.171 --> 01:04:02.571
[SPEAKER_11]: And you know what?

01:04:02.671 --> 01:04:02.891
[SPEAKER_11]: I did...

01:04:03.869 --> 01:04:11.660
[SPEAKER_11]: I watched Shane play the second game's demo at E3 and it was interesting except for all the gore.

01:04:12.461 --> 01:04:13.583
[SPEAKER_11]: I just don't like that stuff.

01:04:14.144 --> 01:04:15.546
[SPEAKER_11]: But yet I love Silent Hill.

01:04:15.646 --> 01:04:16.387
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't explain it.

01:04:17.188 --> 01:04:20.509
[SPEAKER_03]: Silent Hill isn't, well, it's a different kind of gory.

01:04:20.529 --> 01:04:21.530
[SPEAKER_03]: It's more of a decay.

01:04:22.370 --> 01:04:25.231
[SPEAKER_11]: And I feel like Saw is more like LOL gore.

01:04:25.552 --> 01:04:26.652
[SPEAKER_11]: Like it's just like random.

01:04:26.672 --> 01:04:27.292
[SPEAKER_11]: Saw gore.

01:04:27.352 --> 01:04:28.673
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's how I put it.

01:04:29.033 --> 01:04:30.033
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at the violence.

01:04:30.153 --> 01:04:31.014
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

01:04:31.034 --> 01:04:31.614
[SPEAKER_03]: Blood.

01:04:31.914 --> 01:04:34.835
[SPEAKER_03]: Where Saw is fresh squirting, pulsating blood.

01:04:34.955 --> 01:04:35.236
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

01:04:35.596 --> 01:04:38.637
[SPEAKER_03]: Silent Hill is, it's been dead for a while, but it's still twitching.

01:04:38.937 --> 01:04:44.506
[SPEAKER_11]: Or the gore serves as much as I hate to say this, a plot point, as weird as that is.

01:04:44.586 --> 01:04:47.251
[SPEAKER_03]: It's for scene, not for shock.

01:04:47.391 --> 01:04:48.974
[SPEAKER_11]: Check out his head, it's a pyramid.

01:04:49.234 --> 01:04:49.454
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

01:04:50.919 --> 01:04:53.880
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, this guy's wearing a big metal triangle on his head.

01:04:54.100 --> 01:04:55.300
[SPEAKER_03]: Triangle man.

01:04:55.380 --> 01:04:56.261
[SPEAKER_03]: Triangle man.

01:04:58.021 --> 01:05:01.382
[SPEAKER_11]: How about another piece of gaming news, DarkSakura?

01:05:01.622 --> 01:05:02.102
[SPEAKER_01]: News?

01:05:02.362 --> 01:05:02.882
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fantastic.

01:05:02.902 --> 01:05:05.643
[SPEAKER_03]: This made me laugh my ass off, Rob.

01:05:06.484 --> 01:05:12.005
[SPEAKER_03]: Nipponichi, the company that made Disgaea, is doing a game called Criminal Girls for PSP.

01:05:12.785 --> 01:05:17.787
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like bad 70s chicks in prison is what it is.

01:05:19.089 --> 01:05:20.512
[SPEAKER_01]: This sounds awesome.

01:05:21.534 --> 01:05:23.298
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it directed by Quentin Tarantino?

01:05:23.919 --> 01:05:25.202
[SPEAKER_01]: Was Lindsay Lohan in it?

01:05:26.118 --> 01:05:27.059
[SPEAKER_01]: All Man Machete is going to be great.

01:05:27.079 --> 01:05:28.020
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but Lady Gaga is.

01:05:29.581 --> 01:05:29.921
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

01:05:30.141 --> 01:05:30.542
[SPEAKER_03]: Good enough.

01:05:31.062 --> 01:05:33.384
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, is it going to be like the telephone music video for real?

01:05:33.404 --> 01:05:34.045
[SPEAKER_11]: Because that's awesome.

01:05:34.225 --> 01:05:35.085
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a game about rehab.

01:05:35.105 --> 01:05:36.306
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I read the damn story?

01:05:36.647 --> 01:05:36.867
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

01:05:37.047 --> 01:05:37.607
[SPEAKER_11]: Not tonight.

01:05:39.049 --> 01:05:44.253
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, you play as an all-female prison warden that's set in hell.

01:05:45.394 --> 01:05:47.796
[SPEAKER_03]: And you have to rehabilitate seven prisoners.

01:05:48.536 --> 01:05:50.978
[SPEAKER_03]: And each of the prisoners are like seven deadly sins.

01:05:51.038 --> 01:05:53.981
[SPEAKER_03]: You have gluttony, greed, lust, you know.

01:05:56.863 --> 01:05:59.364
[SPEAKER_03]: Misty comes in and asks, is it the home for infinite losers?

01:05:59.904 --> 01:06:01.084
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have a microphone.

01:06:02.065 --> 01:06:02.725
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why she keeps doing it.

01:06:02.745 --> 01:06:04.986
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to say something, come in and grab the microphone.

01:06:05.026 --> 01:06:07.106
[SPEAKER_01]: Just take Misty's when she's not looking.

01:06:07.386 --> 01:06:09.587
[SPEAKER_03]: So you know how you have to rehabilitate them, Rob?

01:06:10.087 --> 01:06:10.307
[SPEAKER_01]: How?

01:06:10.987 --> 01:06:12.728
[SPEAKER_03]: With spankings and massages.

01:06:12.788 --> 01:06:14.088
[SPEAKER_01]: I read about this.

01:06:14.128 --> 01:06:14.949
[SPEAKER_01]: Because here's the deal.

01:06:15.369 --> 01:06:19.330
[SPEAKER_01]: Nippon Ichi had to cancel like three projects.

01:06:21.533 --> 01:06:23.114
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:06:46.704 --> 01:06:48.765
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it work with the Kinect?

01:06:50.866 --> 01:06:54.947
[SPEAKER_15]: It's on the PSP Does it work with the Kinect anyway?

01:06:55.908 --> 01:06:58.769
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably I'm sure someone will find a way

01:07:00.023 --> 01:07:03.925
[SPEAKER_11]: I am... So wait, let me get this straight again.

01:07:04.145 --> 01:07:11.328
[SPEAKER_11]: You are in a prison in the 70s, in hell, and you spank people to discipline them.

01:07:12.329 --> 01:07:13.549
[SPEAKER_11]: Or massage them, right?

01:07:13.949 --> 01:07:14.610
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that what I heard?

01:07:15.490 --> 01:07:24.374
[SPEAKER_11]: I think, ladies and gentlemen... Video game of the year, 2010.

01:07:26.963 --> 01:07:27.783
[SPEAKER_15]: No, there's pictures.

01:07:27.823 --> 01:07:28.704
[SPEAKER_15]: Let me find the picture.

01:07:29.284 --> 01:07:32.405
[SPEAKER_15]: It was... Oh, my gosh.

01:07:32.885 --> 01:07:33.365
[SPEAKER_11]: Was there a secret?

01:07:33.405 --> 01:07:35.126
[SPEAKER_11]: Was the secret word spank?

01:07:35.626 --> 01:07:38.127
[SPEAKER_11]: Did Pee Wee Herman come out before the show?

01:07:39.848 --> 01:07:42.348
[SPEAKER_03]: It was in Den Geeky PlayStation Magazine.

01:07:44.189 --> 01:07:46.750
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, maybe I missed the break during Bobby's show tonight.

01:07:47.370 --> 01:07:50.171
[SPEAKER_11]: Did he come out and say, today's secret word is spank.

01:07:50.331 --> 01:07:52.672
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, so that's why I missed it.

01:07:52.732 --> 01:07:55.213
[SPEAKER_01]: If somebody says spank, scream real loud.

01:07:57.519 --> 01:07:58.120
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you okay, DarkSakura?

01:07:58.140 --> 01:08:05.728
[SPEAKER_03]: I already put the link to the picture in there of what the characters look like with their ginormous boobies.

01:08:06.048 --> 01:08:10.313
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, to listen live, we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.

01:08:10.853 --> 01:08:13.436
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know this makes for terrible radio, but I'm looking at this.

01:08:13.777 --> 01:08:15.619
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, they have gigantic tits.

01:08:17.731 --> 01:08:40.791
[SPEAKER_11]: and they're like doing that whole blushing thing it looks like see how like okay notice this like the top of their tits is red that's either like a really bad sunburn tan it's boob blush or they're getting spanked on their tits probably or even better it's boob blush I can tell you women actually blush their boobies I didn't know that have you ever blushed your boobs not on purpose

01:08:44.008 --> 01:08:46.730
[SPEAKER_11]: This tells you how bad off the Japanese gaming market is.

01:08:46.910 --> 01:08:49.611
[SPEAKER_11]: Or did Dan just have red stuff on his face and he just went...

01:08:56.635 --> 01:08:59.576
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a story about how bad the Japanese gaming market is.

01:09:01.177 --> 01:09:03.718
[SPEAKER_01]: They're killing their important projects and they're keeping this.

01:09:04.598 --> 01:09:05.559
[SPEAKER_01]: They know who their market is.

01:09:05.999 --> 01:09:10.521
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, right, because that's the people in Japan who are buying the games or the psycho pervert otakus.

01:09:10.981 --> 01:09:13.662
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry, but this game sounds awesome.

01:09:14.103 --> 01:09:15.383
[SPEAKER_11]: And why are you knocking it?

01:09:15.463 --> 01:09:17.564
[SPEAKER_11]: Because we should be getting this game as well.

01:09:17.684 --> 01:09:18.605
[SPEAKER_11]: We won't, but we should.

01:09:18.905 --> 01:09:21.826
[SPEAKER_11]: This is President Cat 2010 right here.

01:09:21.946 --> 01:09:22.667
[SPEAKER_11]: I want this game.

01:09:22.687 --> 01:09:23.407
[SPEAKER_03]: I still want President Cat.

01:09:24.415 --> 01:09:25.116
[SPEAKER_03]: Dammit, me too.

01:09:26.537 --> 01:09:28.139
[SPEAKER_03]: Why have you not done this for me, husband?

01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:30.602
[SPEAKER_11]: I have no idea what you're talking about.

01:09:31.383 --> 01:09:32.044
[SPEAKER_03]: President Cat.

01:09:32.124 --> 01:09:33.625
[SPEAKER_11]: Your husband doesn't actually listen to this show.

01:09:33.665 --> 01:09:36.148
[SPEAKER_11]: He just likes to come on once in a while and bring the lulls.

01:09:37.129 --> 01:09:41.674
[SPEAKER_01]: I know about the existence of President Cat, but I don't really know what she's talking about.

01:09:43.856 --> 01:09:44.277
[SPEAKER_11]: That's all right.

01:09:45.188 --> 01:09:48.489
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, let's get into what video games are coming out soon.

01:09:48.529 --> 01:09:51.351
[SPEAKER_11]: And around the world, we're going to travel the world and look at release dates.

01:09:51.371 --> 01:09:52.851
[SPEAKER_11]: And we'll start in America.

01:09:53.712 --> 01:09:54.552
[SPEAKER_11]: America.

01:09:54.912 --> 01:10:00.154
[SPEAKER_02]: Coming out this... You said America, Rob, so I was just representing.

01:10:00.174 --> 01:10:01.175
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope the mic didn't pick that up.

01:10:01.615 --> 01:10:03.436
[SPEAKER_11]: You know the mic turns off, you know.

01:10:03.816 --> 01:10:04.256
[SPEAKER_03]: Mine doesn't.

01:10:04.676 --> 01:10:05.617
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just representing.

01:10:06.817 --> 01:10:07.277
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, thank you.

01:10:07.357 --> 01:10:08.918
[SPEAKER_11]: Alpha Cat Anagram in chat brings up a good point.

01:10:08.938 --> 01:10:13.420
[SPEAKER_11]: The PSP is region-free, so it's less of a pain than region-locked President Cat.

01:10:14.036 --> 01:10:14.676
[SPEAKER_08]: Good job.

01:10:15.256 --> 01:10:15.496
[SPEAKER_11]: Love it.

01:10:15.856 --> 01:10:19.157
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, coming out this week in America, Madden NFL 11, of course.

01:10:19.177 --> 01:10:20.197
[SPEAKER_11]: We already talked about that before.

01:10:20.237 --> 01:10:23.098
[SPEAKER_11]: It's coming out on the 10th and there's midnight launches going on everywhere.

01:10:23.538 --> 01:10:27.799
[SPEAKER_11]: And do any games dare to compete against Madden 11?

01:10:28.179 --> 01:10:29.360
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think so.

01:10:29.460 --> 01:10:30.800
[SPEAKER_11]: There's not a lot else coming out.

01:10:30.820 --> 01:10:31.560
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me see what counter.

01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:36.741
[SPEAKER_11]: There's also tons and tons and tons of peripherals and things coming out.

01:10:36.922 --> 01:10:40.342
[SPEAKER_11]: But as far as games coming out against Madden 11, nope.

01:10:40.842 --> 01:10:41.703
[SPEAKER_11]: This is Madden's week.

01:10:42.263 --> 01:10:42.963
[SPEAKER_11]: That's it for the U.S.

01:10:43.483 --> 01:10:47.786
[SPEAKER_03]: Meanwhile in England, they're like, Madden, that's a game for wankers!

01:10:50.707 --> 01:10:55.109
[SPEAKER_03]: We have coming out on the 10th, Dragon Age Golems of Amgarak.

01:10:57.050 --> 01:10:58.731
[SPEAKER_03]: On 11th, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World.

01:10:58.831 --> 01:11:02.413
[SPEAKER_03]: On the 12th, yeah, Madden, NFL 11, like anyone's going to give a crap about it over there.

01:11:03.414 --> 01:11:07.316
[SPEAKER_03]: 13th is Hoop World and Ship Simulator Extremes.

01:11:09.157 --> 01:11:09.437
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

01:11:10.666 --> 01:11:30.757
[SPEAKER_11]: I gotta say, just tangent a little bit I didn't know much about that whole Scott Pilgrim vs. the World thing I didn't realize that it's based on a comic book where clearly the author has a huge boner for video games because there's so many video game references in it Uh-oh, Mystique's coming in And he's Canadian Well then, fuck him!

01:11:30.857 --> 01:11:34.058
[SPEAKER_09]: He's from Canadia I love Canadia

01:11:37.421 --> 01:11:38.442
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that near Elbonia?

01:11:39.003 --> 01:11:41.525
[SPEAKER_11]: Look, look, I have Canadian friends, okay?

01:11:42.206 --> 01:11:42.606
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay?

01:11:42.686 --> 01:11:43.127
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry.

01:11:43.307 --> 01:11:43.587
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

01:11:43.807 --> 01:11:45.049
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the Canadianites.

01:11:46.170 --> 01:11:46.910
[SPEAKER_11]: No, for real, though.

01:11:46.930 --> 01:11:47.551
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh-oh.

01:11:47.671 --> 01:11:48.272
[SPEAKER_11]: Mystique's coming.

01:11:48.332 --> 01:11:50.774
[SPEAKER_03]: We're here.

01:11:50.854 --> 01:11:51.875
[SPEAKER_03]: We're here.

01:11:52.075 --> 01:11:54.217
[SPEAKER_03]: Flop, flop, flop, because she's wearing, I think, flip-flops or something.

01:11:54.438 --> 01:11:55.559
[SPEAKER_03]: Smack, smack, smack, smack, smack, smack.

01:11:58.790 --> 01:11:59.331
[SPEAKER_11]: But here's the thing.

01:12:00.371 --> 01:12:07.316
[SPEAKER_11]: At first, I had no interest in seeing the movie because I was like, oh, it's Michael Cera and it's not Arrested Development, so why would I care, right?

01:12:08.177 --> 01:12:12.840
[SPEAKER_11]: But then I hear it's all about this video game homage.

01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:17.523
[SPEAKER_11]: And then the whole thing where they actually went to Miyamoto to get the rights to use the Zelda music.

01:12:18.163 --> 01:12:24.387
[SPEAKER_11]: And you know the whole comic book is about he goes to defeat the ex-boyfriends who are like the seven bosses.

01:12:25.408 --> 01:12:26.029
[SPEAKER_11]: Dan, take me on a date!

01:12:26.069 --> 01:12:26.169
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes!

01:12:51.964 --> 01:13:06.963
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not dating all of you Misty would I'll take Misty out on a date because Alan's in San Francisco so Misty can be my date but no Nookie Rob's got jungle fever Rob's got jungle fever

01:13:09.004 --> 01:13:11.646
[SPEAKER_03]: If we call Alan, can we watch?

01:13:12.307 --> 01:13:13.628
[SPEAKER_11]: Stop it.

01:13:13.748 --> 01:13:14.209
[SPEAKER_11]: Stop it.

01:13:14.930 --> 01:13:16.791
[SPEAKER_11]: Y'all are filthy, disgusting pervs.

01:13:16.891 --> 01:13:17.232
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey!

01:13:17.572 --> 01:13:18.213
[SPEAKER_03]: You hang out with us.

01:13:18.433 --> 01:13:20.275
[SPEAKER_11]: Xbox 360 in Japan.

01:13:20.315 --> 01:13:21.536
[SPEAKER_11]: How about Japanese releases?

01:13:21.796 --> 01:13:22.297
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess.

01:13:22.477 --> 01:13:23.778
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's a sport they love in Japan.

01:13:23.878 --> 01:13:24.399
[SPEAKER_11]: Baseball.

01:13:24.479 --> 01:13:27.842
[SPEAKER_11]: Major League Baseball 2K10 is out from 2K Sports this week in Japan.

01:13:28.082 --> 01:13:29.484
[SPEAKER_11]: And it can't even sell there.

01:13:30.224 --> 01:13:30.825
[SPEAKER_11]: Stop.

01:13:30.885 --> 01:13:32.166
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it does all right over there.

01:13:32.426 --> 01:13:32.807
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

01:13:32.867 --> 01:13:34.168
[SPEAKER_03]: They're big, big.

01:13:34.468 --> 01:13:36.610
[SPEAKER_03]: They got the big boner for baseball in Japan.

01:13:37.531 --> 01:13:38.472
[SPEAKER_03]: Even bigger than here.

01:13:38.872 --> 01:13:39.172
[SPEAKER_01]: MLB 2K.

01:13:39.212 --> 01:13:39.653
[SPEAKER_01]: Sucks.

01:13:39.973 --> 01:13:42.616
[SPEAKER_03]: Sports of Japan.

01:13:43.096 --> 01:13:44.417
[SPEAKER_03]: Sumo and baseball.

01:13:44.677 --> 01:13:46.779
[SPEAKER_11]: That might actually be their big release this week.

01:13:46.819 --> 01:13:47.540
[SPEAKER_11]: But I have to say this.

01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:49.121
[SPEAKER_11]: On the Nintendo Wii, it's not this week.

01:13:49.161 --> 01:13:50.583
[SPEAKER_11]: It's coming out August 26th.

01:13:50.683 --> 01:13:51.784
[SPEAKER_11]: But I'm sorry.

01:13:51.824 --> 01:13:53.445
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the greatest name for a video game ever.

01:13:53.465 --> 01:13:54.246
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you ready for this?

01:13:54.446 --> 01:13:54.867
[SPEAKER_11]: On the Wii.

01:13:54.887 --> 01:13:56.248
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Super Spankin' Massage.

01:13:57.369 --> 01:13:58.210
[SPEAKER_11]: August 26, Twinkle Queen

01:14:16.636 --> 01:14:17.236
[SPEAKER_11]: That's on the 26th.

01:14:17.436 --> 01:14:18.077
[SPEAKER_11]: That's not this week.

01:14:18.097 --> 01:14:20.137
[SPEAKER_11]: But I just want to take a moment to acknowledge Twinkle Queen.

01:14:21.638 --> 01:14:23.759
[SPEAKER_11]: It looks like the baseball game is the only big release in Japan this week.

01:14:23.819 --> 01:14:24.399
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, no, I lied.

01:14:24.419 --> 01:14:25.139
[SPEAKER_11]: On the PSP.

01:14:25.719 --> 01:14:26.259
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, awesome.

01:14:26.499 --> 01:14:28.560
[SPEAKER_11]: Corpse Party is the name of the game.

01:14:29.080 --> 01:14:34.482
[SPEAKER_11]: Corpse Party Blood Covered Repeated Fear is coming out in a regular and limited edition.

01:14:34.502 --> 01:14:39.124
[SPEAKER_11]: It looks like some type of survival-ish horror game with a very 8-bit style to it.

01:14:39.464 --> 01:14:40.164
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's a chick.

01:14:40.484 --> 01:14:42.825
[SPEAKER_11]: They're wearing Sakura uniforms.

01:14:42.845 --> 01:14:44.306
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just wearing schoolgirl uniforms.

01:14:44.326 --> 01:14:44.466
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

01:14:45.726 --> 01:14:47.327
[SPEAKER_11]: But I guess they're having a corpse party?

01:14:47.447 --> 01:14:52.788
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know Also coming out of the PSP Remember last week that Scary Stories game came out?

01:14:52.948 --> 01:14:56.449
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, that's right But that was just like public domain stories on the DS, right?

01:14:56.529 --> 01:15:10.432
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah Kazoku Keikai-ku comes out on PSP this week And it looks like the less scary alternative if you want to play Because these girls are eating And this girl looks like she's farting on another one I don't know what's happening there, but whatever

01:15:11.193 --> 01:15:11.753
[SPEAKER_11]: Scott Pilgrim vs. The World

01:15:31.270 --> 01:15:40.197
[SPEAKER_11]: The series is about 23-year-old Canadian Scott Pilgrim, a slacker, hero, and part-time bassist who is living in Toronto and plays bass guitar in the band Sex Bob-Omb.

01:15:40.758 --> 01:15:47.283
[SPEAKER_11]: He falls in love with American delivery girl Ramona V. Flowers, but must defeat her seven evil ex-boyfriends in order to date her.

01:15:47.923 --> 01:15:48.964
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's the plot of the movie.

01:15:49.044 --> 01:15:49.745
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cute.

01:15:50.045 --> 01:15:50.666
[SPEAKER_11]: It does sound cute.

01:15:50.686 --> 01:15:53.728
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way... Dan, will you defeat my seven exes to date me?

01:15:54.492 --> 01:15:56.293
[SPEAKER_11]: That probably wouldn't be very hard.

01:15:56.594 --> 01:16:01.898
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the rival bands in the game, or in the comics, is called Clash at Demon Head.

01:16:02.338 --> 01:16:02.578
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.

01:16:02.598 --> 01:16:03.319
[SPEAKER_11]: That's great.

01:16:03.539 --> 01:16:06.521
[SPEAKER_11]: See, that's how you knew that guy had a boner for video games.

01:16:06.601 --> 01:16:07.141
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no doubt.

01:16:07.301 --> 01:16:10.444
[SPEAKER_11]: People don't know that game unless they're... Well, Sex Bob-omb is, you know... Sex Bob-omb's awesome, too.

01:16:10.464 --> 01:16:13.826
[SPEAKER_01]: Sex Bob-omb's a pretty good one, but yeah, Clash at Demon Head, that's pretty obscure.

01:16:15.047 --> 01:16:15.527
[SPEAKER_01]: It's awesome.

01:16:16.008 --> 01:16:16.348
Squeak.

01:16:16.588 --> 01:16:19.651
[SPEAKER_11]: The game is actually really, really cool, by the way.

01:16:19.911 --> 01:16:21.272
[SPEAKER_11]: Why are you having a squeak, DarkSakura?

01:16:21.372 --> 01:16:25.616
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I watched the trailer for this and I totally, totally, totally, totally, totally want this game.

01:16:25.756 --> 01:16:26.757
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what is it?

01:16:26.897 --> 01:16:27.698
[SPEAKER_03]: Sonic Colors.

01:16:29.099 --> 01:16:29.479
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.

01:16:30.500 --> 01:16:30.740
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

01:16:32.062 --> 01:16:32.322
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

01:16:32.582 --> 01:16:33.583
[SPEAKER_01]: The theme song is awesome.

01:16:33.834 --> 01:16:36.115
[SPEAKER_03]: The theme song is cheeseball-tastic and I love it.

01:16:36.195 --> 01:16:36.775
[SPEAKER_01]: But not good.

01:16:36.895 --> 01:16:39.556
[SPEAKER_03]: But not in the way that everyone's supersonic racing.

01:16:41.597 --> 01:16:43.018
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's Sonic Colors.

01:16:43.038 --> 01:16:43.698
[SPEAKER_03]: It's coming out.

01:16:43.898 --> 01:16:44.378
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, damn it.

01:16:44.618 --> 01:16:45.759
[SPEAKER_11]: I was trying to play it here in studio.

01:16:45.779 --> 01:16:46.799
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a stupid ad on this.

01:16:46.839 --> 01:16:47.059
[SPEAKER_11]: Hold on.

01:16:47.079 --> 01:16:48.120
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll get to the ad in a moment.

01:16:48.580 --> 01:16:49.440
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not a good ad.

01:16:49.520 --> 01:16:50.561
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a stupid ad.

01:16:50.641 --> 01:16:52.801
[SPEAKER_03]: In Europe, the game is coming out November 12th.

01:16:53.682 --> 01:16:57.343
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's actually the Sonic Team head.

01:16:57.363 --> 01:17:01.665
[SPEAKER_03]: Iizuka Takashi is the big dude.

01:17:02.966 --> 01:17:10.671
[SPEAKER_03]: Who is handling the game, and it's pretty, and it's really pretty.

01:17:10.691 --> 01:17:13.914
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at this and tell me this isn't gorgeous.

01:17:14.014 --> 01:17:14.394
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks cute.

01:17:14.414 --> 01:17:15.675
[SPEAKER_08]: Take off at the speed of sound.

01:17:25.796 --> 01:17:26.676
[SPEAKER_11]: That's it, buffering.

01:17:27.977 --> 01:17:29.018
[SPEAKER_11]: It did the same thing for me.

01:17:29.038 --> 01:17:29.578
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, whatever.

01:17:29.658 --> 01:17:30.078
[SPEAKER_11]: There you go.

01:17:30.679 --> 01:17:30.999
[SPEAKER_11]: Good enough.

01:17:31.599 --> 01:17:34.480
[SPEAKER_01]: Loading really, really slow.

01:17:36.221 --> 01:17:39.383
[SPEAKER_03]: At any rate, it looks intensely, intensely fun.

01:17:41.664 --> 01:17:44.846
[SPEAKER_03]: It reminded me just of how excited I was about Sonic Adventure.

01:17:46.307 --> 01:17:47.227
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's no shadow.

01:17:47.807 --> 01:17:49.248
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no all these other characters.

01:17:49.388 --> 01:17:50.949
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just freaking Sonic and Tails.

01:17:51.229 --> 01:17:52.610
[SPEAKER_11]: It looks cute as hell, I'll give you that.

01:17:54.052 --> 01:18:08.301
[SPEAKER_11]: SSJ100 Matt is in our chatroom saying Rob's band, speaking of like Scott Pilgrim's band and the rival bands Rob's band is Boom Boom Kitty Fuck I don't know where that comes from That was from Jay Can I call you Boom Boom Kitty Fuck?

01:18:08.401 --> 01:18:19.328
[SPEAKER_11]: No, wasn't it The nickname that he gave his Boo Boo Kitty Fuck Not Boom Boom There's a difference between Boom Boom and Boo Boo It's crossed over with Boom Boom Dollar Alright

01:18:20.034 --> 01:18:23.136
[SPEAKER_11]: The Mashup of the Century Boom Boom Kitty Fuck Orange Lounge

01:18:43.430 --> 01:18:43.950
[SPEAKER_11]: True story, people!

01:19:07.492 --> 01:19:26.160
[SPEAKER_11]: by the way if you want old episodes of OLR they're out there and I'm just gonna I'm gonna warn you though old OLR is nothing like new OLR he means out there like it is just wow wow have we come a long way in eight years like we haven't come far but it's still a long way we've come a way

01:19:27.160 --> 01:19:29.302
[SPEAKER_03]: We have evolved, but the spirit lives on.

01:19:29.462 --> 01:19:37.187
[SPEAKER_11]: If you listen to episode one, it really is a lot like tonight's show, actually, where it just isn't really about anything.

01:19:37.728 --> 01:19:38.208
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I'm kidding.

01:19:38.248 --> 01:19:38.568
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm kidding.

01:19:38.688 --> 01:19:39.769
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a lot shorter, though.

01:19:40.410 --> 01:19:40.630
[SPEAKER_11]: It was.

01:19:40.670 --> 01:19:41.931
[SPEAKER_11]: We used to only have a two-hour show.

01:19:41.951 --> 01:19:43.092
[SPEAKER_11]: Now we're like four hours.

01:19:43.112 --> 01:19:43.512
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

01:19:44.573 --> 01:19:44.833
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyhow.

01:19:45.731 --> 01:19:46.171
[SPEAKER_11]: Rob, more!

01:20:06.944 --> 01:20:20.921
[SPEAKER_11]: it's actually available for download so you can hack the ROM there and what's weird about this though they're not trying to do it to actually say like oh hey we're excited for Sonic 4 no no they're adding the features to try and point out how awful they are

01:20:23.334 --> 01:20:23.934
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know though.

01:20:23.975 --> 01:20:27.497
[SPEAKER_11]: I think there'd be a lot of people that would get this to kind of like see the cool new features.

01:20:27.597 --> 01:20:27.877
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

01:20:27.917 --> 01:20:29.218
[SPEAKER_11]: Sonic 4 didn't look terrible to me.

01:20:29.779 --> 01:20:30.179
[SPEAKER_03]: But whatever.

01:20:30.199 --> 01:20:31.300
[SPEAKER_03]: This is why I need Sonic Colors.

01:20:31.540 --> 01:20:33.221
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a very interesting form of protest.

01:20:33.261 --> 01:20:34.762
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you miss that a couple shows ago?

01:20:35.062 --> 01:20:35.683
[SPEAKER_11]: Matt brought that up.

01:20:35.983 --> 01:20:38.525
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the Sonic hat that you get for pre-ordering it.

01:20:39.045 --> 01:20:39.906
[SPEAKER_11]: And it actually looks like a hat.

01:20:39.926 --> 01:20:40.346
[SPEAKER_10]: Pre-order!

01:20:42.288 --> 01:20:42.568
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

01:20:42.628 --> 01:20:43.188
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't look at me.

01:20:45.550 --> 01:20:55.637
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, well, speaking of classic games such as Sonic 2 and, well, really any Sonic in general, we like to take a trip through the gaming vault and find a classic game of the week.

01:20:55.677 --> 01:21:03.523
[SPEAKER_11]: The Dark Sakura says, hey, listen, you damn kids, you ought to be playing this game and showing a little respect.

01:21:05.646 --> 01:21:07.367
[SPEAKER_11]: It's called the classic video game of the week.

01:21:07.427 --> 01:21:10.708
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, what is tonight's classic video game of the week?

01:21:10.989 --> 01:21:14.570
[SPEAKER_03]: Shadow Dancer, specifically the Mega Drive slash Genesis version.

01:21:14.910 --> 01:21:17.572
[SPEAKER_11]: Imagine that, a Genesis game inspired by your Genesis.

01:21:21.253 --> 01:21:26.016
[SPEAKER_03]: Although, now this is one of the games that I had Dan playing for me last night.

01:21:30.516 --> 01:21:31.276
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just Shinobi.

01:21:46.261 --> 01:21:49.562
[SPEAKER_03]: The Mega Drive version of Shadow Dancer, The Secret of Shinobi.

01:21:49.982 --> 01:21:52.102
[SPEAKER_03]: It came out on December 1st, 1990 in Japan.

01:21:52.782 --> 01:21:55.103
[SPEAKER_03]: And the releases came out in North America and Europe afterwards.

01:21:55.283 --> 01:21:56.703
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's on the Virtual Console.

01:21:58.384 --> 01:22:01.324
[SPEAKER_03]: And also in the Sega Genesis Collection for PS2 and PSP.

01:22:01.424 --> 01:22:03.345
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, that dog just ate that guy's face.

01:22:03.445 --> 01:22:04.105
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, right?

01:22:04.305 --> 01:22:05.165
[SPEAKER_03]: This one has a dog.

01:22:06.005 --> 01:22:06.225
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

01:22:06.545 --> 01:22:07.965
[SPEAKER_03]: You have a ninja dog.

01:22:08.986 --> 01:22:10.286
[SPEAKER_03]: How freaking cool is that?

01:22:11.420 --> 01:22:17.803
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, the main guy did not have a name in the arcade version.

01:22:18.564 --> 01:22:20.765
[SPEAKER_03]: In this one, though, he's called Hayate.

01:22:21.725 --> 01:22:28.689
[SPEAKER_03]: And his dog is... And he's actually supposed to be the son of Joe Musashi from the original Shinobi.

01:22:30.370 --> 01:22:32.150
[SPEAKER_03]: However, that was in the Japanese version.

01:22:32.291 --> 01:22:32.791
[SPEAKER_03]: In the U.S.

01:22:32.871 --> 01:22:35.672
[SPEAKER_03]: version, he's just Joe Musashi.

01:22:36.373 --> 01:22:37.373
[SPEAKER_03]: The dog's name is Yamato.

01:22:38.774 --> 01:22:40.955
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you know that that was the traditional name of Japan?

01:22:42.805 --> 01:22:43.225
[SPEAKER_11]: I did not.

01:22:43.506 --> 01:22:43.986
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you know.

01:22:44.586 --> 01:22:46.147
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why the ship was called Yamato.

01:22:47.308 --> 01:22:58.756
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, they're trying to avenge the death of a guy named Kato who was Hayate's mentor.

01:22:59.736 --> 01:23:02.118
[SPEAKER_03]: Or Musashi's student, depending on which version you're playing.

01:23:03.233 --> 01:23:04.954
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, different stages, different stuff.

01:23:06.135 --> 01:23:11.559
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead of looking for time bombs like you did in the coin-op blend, you rescue hostages.

01:23:12.640 --> 01:23:20.505
[SPEAKER_03]: And your bonus ones, instead of being the first person ones, are where you fall off of the building and shoot ninjas in the face with shuriken.

01:23:21.877 --> 01:23:22.558
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

01:23:44.418 --> 01:23:48.380
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's pretty, pretty hardcore.

01:23:48.480 --> 01:23:51.221
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, I didn't do the first Shinobi because honestly I like this one better.

01:23:52.462 --> 01:23:54.163
[SPEAKER_15]: Because you have a ninja dog!

01:23:55.743 --> 01:23:56.183
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell me!

01:23:57.104 --> 01:23:58.705
[SPEAKER_03]: Dance in the other room and go, ninja dog!

01:23:59.545 --> 01:24:01.446
[SPEAKER_11]: That should just be a video game right there, ninja dog.

01:24:01.746 --> 01:24:02.006
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

01:24:02.126 --> 01:24:04.107
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

01:24:04.647 --> 01:24:06.208
[SPEAKER_03]: I want a ninja dog.

01:24:06.808 --> 01:24:09.169
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I want my cat to be the big fat geisha.

01:24:11.530 --> 01:24:12.651
[SPEAKER_03]: He's an interesting ninja.

01:24:13.621 --> 01:24:14.282
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that it then?

01:24:14.322 --> 01:24:14.742
[SPEAKER_11]: That's it?

01:24:15.102 --> 01:24:15.322
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

01:24:15.562 --> 01:24:18.865
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, classic game of the week is Shadow Dancer.

01:24:19.826 --> 01:24:22.568
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to say you did like one of the other Shinobi games before.

01:24:22.608 --> 01:24:23.428
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think it was this one.

01:24:23.468 --> 01:24:25.089
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I actually did Shinobi before.

01:24:25.330 --> 01:24:26.010
[SPEAKER_03]: You probably did.

01:24:26.250 --> 01:24:31.114
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to say I've seen that in the... But Shadow Dancer is freaking amazing because you have an injured dog!

01:24:32.060 --> 01:24:32.841
[SPEAKER_11]: and Tacos.

01:25:07.230 --> 01:25:09.652
[SPEAKER_11]: Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:25:09.712 --> 01:25:15.317
[SPEAKER_11]: We are live on Sunday, August 8th, 2010 for the 377th episode of our show.

01:25:15.637 --> 01:25:19.541
[SPEAKER_11]: We're taping live at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.

01:25:19.941 --> 01:25:24.385
[SPEAKER_11]: No Loki tonight, he's still out on baby leave, but Dan the Man is joining us in studio tonight.

01:25:24.645 --> 01:25:25.065
[SPEAKER_11]: Sweet!

01:25:25.345 --> 01:25:30.248
[SPEAKER_11]: As is Misty, joining us all the way from the east-ish coast.

01:25:30.388 --> 01:25:34.910
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all the east coast to me, even though she's really from the Midwest, but we had that talk a little earlier.

01:25:34.970 --> 01:25:37.231
[SPEAKER_11]: But she flew out here to be with us, so we really appreciate it.

01:25:37.251 --> 01:25:37.611
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have tacos.

01:25:38.091 --> 01:25:42.754
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, and we are all eating Mystique's tacos right now, and they're delicious, I must say.

01:25:43.074 --> 01:25:43.474
[SPEAKER_11]: It's great.

01:25:44.114 --> 01:25:45.875
[SPEAKER_11]: So, needs more salt, though.

01:25:45.995 --> 01:25:46.876
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

01:25:46.916 --> 01:25:47.136
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

01:25:47.836 --> 01:25:49.437
[SPEAKER_11]: Because they're low sodium, get it?

01:25:49.617 --> 01:25:50.878
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, anyway.

01:25:50.978 --> 01:25:52.019
[SPEAKER_11]: No, actually, they were really good.

01:25:52.959 --> 01:25:56.782
[SPEAKER_11]: I would never have guessed that they were any type of special diet tacos.

01:25:57.603 --> 01:26:01.625
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyhow, I'm kind of tired today, you guys, and I apologize.

01:26:01.965 --> 01:26:02.726
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm really tired.

01:26:02.806 --> 01:26:11.972
[SPEAKER_11]: But last night, I actually did something I've been wanting to do for like 10 years and never have had the opportunity to until last night.

01:26:12.693 --> 01:26:16.615
[SPEAKER_11]: And that was I went and saw Showgirls in a theater.

01:26:18.176 --> 01:26:22.677
[SPEAKER_11]: It was... Mystique is laughing.

01:26:22.737 --> 01:26:23.337
[SPEAKER_11]: No, here's the thing.

01:26:23.557 --> 01:26:24.657
[SPEAKER_11]: Wait, wait, Mystique, Mystique.

01:26:25.017 --> 01:26:25.577
[SPEAKER_11]: Where's Mystique?

01:26:25.597 --> 01:26:27.978
[SPEAKER_11]: Mystique, get in here for a minute, because I have to tell you about this.

01:26:28.518 --> 01:26:30.278
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, get Mystique a mic.

01:26:30.658 --> 01:26:31.598
[SPEAKER_01]: Get in here, Mystique.

01:26:31.638 --> 01:26:35.059
[SPEAKER_09]: You actually paid to see Showgirls?

01:26:35.099 --> 01:26:35.839
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I paid.

01:26:36.439 --> 01:26:37.679
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, no, I got Alan to pay.

01:26:38.039 --> 01:26:42.420
[SPEAKER_11]: Alan paid $15 a ticket.

01:26:42.460 --> 01:26:43.280
[SPEAKER_11]: No, this isn't in there.

01:26:43.500 --> 01:26:45.541
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so we're at the Castro Theater, right?

01:26:46.261 --> 01:26:47.181
[SPEAKER_11]: Right in the heart...

01:26:49.116 --> 01:26:49.256
[SPEAKER_11]: Boobies!

01:26:49.276 --> 01:26:49.796
[SPEAKER_11]: Boobies everywhere!

01:26:49.816 --> 01:26:50.116
[SPEAKER_11]: Boobies!

01:26:50.156 --> 01:26:52.097
[SPEAKER_11]: You saw that movie when it came out!

01:27:16.906 --> 01:27:21.408
[SPEAKER_11]: Which is funny because, you know, I'm gay and all, but boobies are great.

01:27:21.608 --> 01:27:23.788
[SPEAKER_09]: Why is it with gay guys and boobs?

01:27:23.888 --> 01:27:25.069
[SPEAKER_09]: I've talked to a lot of gay guys.

01:27:25.149 --> 01:27:26.209
[SPEAKER_09]: They like boobs.

01:27:26.369 --> 01:27:27.630
[SPEAKER_11]: We like to call them fun bags.

01:27:29.810 --> 01:27:30.591
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what they are.

01:27:31.771 --> 01:27:32.771
[SPEAKER_09]: I call mine jubbles.

01:27:34.432 --> 01:27:35.152
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you name your boobs?

01:27:35.372 --> 01:27:36.773
[SPEAKER_09]: They're just jubbles.

01:27:37.913 --> 01:27:39.213
[SPEAKER_11]: But there's two of them, right?

01:27:39.253 --> 01:27:40.694
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't have a uniboob, do you?

01:27:40.914 --> 01:27:43.135
[SPEAKER_09]: No, they're the twins, but I just call them my jubbles.

01:27:43.375 --> 01:27:43.995
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, I see.

01:27:44.315 --> 01:27:45.296
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, that works, that works.

01:27:45.516 --> 01:27:47.957
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you name your boobies, DarkSakura?

01:27:49.959 --> 01:27:52.120
[SPEAKER_03]: One's don't touch me there, and two is stop it.

01:27:55.082 --> 01:27:55.402
[SPEAKER_11]: Lies.

01:27:56.183 --> 01:27:58.464
[SPEAKER_01]: I call them Lefty and Righty.

01:27:58.484 --> 01:28:00.646
[SPEAKER_11]: Shut up!

01:28:00.846 --> 01:28:04.348
[SPEAKER_11]: I had a girlfriend, yes, believe it or not, when I was like 16.

01:28:04.428 --> 01:28:07.190
[SPEAKER_09]: See, I'm not surprised about that either.

01:28:07.410 --> 01:28:08.411
[SPEAKER_11]: Her name was Chuck.

01:28:08.611 --> 01:28:10.332
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, shut up.

01:28:12.249 --> 01:28:18.154
[SPEAKER_11]: She named her boobies, and her boobies' names, get this, I am not making this up, were Pebbles and Bam Bam.

01:28:20.696 --> 01:28:21.236
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

01:28:22.377 --> 01:28:23.037
[SPEAKER_11]: How was their names?

01:28:23.978 --> 01:28:24.438
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

01:28:24.799 --> 01:28:26.900
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we know why Rob is gay.

01:28:28.982 --> 01:28:29.602
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what, though?

01:28:29.943 --> 01:28:33.165
[SPEAKER_03]: If dudes can name their junk, women can name their tits.

01:28:34.866 --> 01:28:35.566
[SPEAKER_03]: That's very true.

01:28:35.847 --> 01:28:36.707
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a free country.

01:28:37.648 --> 01:28:41.131
[SPEAKER_03]: Mine are just my boobs.

01:28:41.151 --> 01:28:41.671
[SPEAKER_03]: The girls.

01:28:42.272 --> 01:28:43.013
[SPEAKER_03]: Misty?

01:28:43.253 --> 01:28:44.013
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not even going to ask.

01:28:44.874 --> 01:28:46.776
[SPEAKER_11]: She'll throw that bottle of Mountain Dew at me.

01:28:48.097 --> 01:28:48.477
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see.

01:28:48.917 --> 01:28:51.640
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would I waste Mountain Dew like that?

01:28:51.660 --> 01:28:52.941
[SPEAKER_03]: Frisbee says kibbles and bits.

01:28:53.421 --> 01:28:54.262
Alright.

01:28:57.981 --> 01:28:59.922
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to know great boob names.

01:28:59.982 --> 01:29:02.644
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, I know that has nothing to do with gaming, but I don't care.

01:29:03.725 --> 01:29:04.646
[SPEAKER_11]: I need to know good boob names.

01:29:04.666 --> 01:29:06.147
[SPEAKER_03]: I know Joe Diaz says hers are named.

01:29:07.447 --> 01:29:09.409
[SPEAKER_11]: Wait, what are... She's not saying what they are.

01:29:09.429 --> 01:29:10.510
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, bummer.

01:29:11.150 --> 01:29:12.871
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on, you open that bag.

01:29:13.151 --> 01:29:14.012
[SPEAKER_03]: Now let the cat out.

01:29:16.433 --> 01:29:19.856
[SPEAKER_11]: Tiger Claw says you could just call them beanbags because you know you want to sleep on top of them.

01:29:20.156 --> 01:29:22.197
[SPEAKER_11]: That actually is one really good use of boobies.

01:29:23.198 --> 01:29:29.323
[SPEAKER_11]: Sometimes when you're watching a movie and cuddling with a fag hag, there's boobies that you can rest your weary head on.

01:29:30.924 --> 01:29:31.725
[SPEAKER_03]: I think boobs are great.

01:29:32.385 --> 01:29:35.028
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know that they actually sell boob pillows in Japan?

01:29:35.048 --> 01:29:37.309
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen the hand pillows.

01:29:40.962 --> 01:29:41.403
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

01:30:01.688 --> 01:30:30.685
[SPEAKER_11]: let's see she said my left one is named righty and the right one is named lefty so the guy doesn't get confused SSJ100 Matt says in chat see see see the religious fanatics and gays can both agree on the fact that boobs are fun you know what we do you know all this this prop I can see your dirty pillows what didn't you see Carrie do not want oh years ago years ago they're all gonna laugh at you all right

01:30:32.530 --> 01:30:36.733
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's get into... Let's derail the show further, shall we?

01:30:36.973 --> 01:30:37.414
[SPEAKER_11]: And how.

01:30:37.614 --> 01:30:39.055
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, let's get into Twitter topics.

01:30:39.115 --> 01:30:42.538
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's let the listeners control the show with topics for a little bit.

01:30:43.158 --> 01:30:43.759
[SPEAKER_11]: Sweet!

01:30:47.001 --> 01:30:49.824
[SPEAKER_11]: You can't run out to get a taco while we're trying to do Twitter topics.

01:30:49.844 --> 01:30:50.945
[SPEAKER_11]: She ran out to get a taco.

01:30:51.285 --> 01:30:51.926
[SPEAKER_11]: This is not...

01:30:52.884 --> 01:30:53.784
[SPEAKER_11]: Taco Topics.

01:30:53.864 --> 01:30:54.945
[SPEAKER_11]: It's Twitter Topics.

01:30:55.005 --> 01:30:56.765
[SPEAKER_11]: Taco Time.

01:30:57.045 --> 01:30:57.385
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go.

01:30:57.445 --> 01:30:58.065
[SPEAKER_01]: Twitter Topics.

01:30:58.526 --> 01:30:58.806
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

01:30:59.106 --> 01:30:59.466
[SPEAKER_11]: You ready, Dan?

01:30:59.526 --> 01:31:00.166
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm ready.

01:31:00.286 --> 01:31:00.866
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a game.

01:31:01.106 --> 01:31:03.807
[SPEAKER_11]: Robocoon gets our first Taco Topic tonight.

01:31:04.387 --> 01:31:09.068
[SPEAKER_11]: Saying that there is a game called Privates that is now out on the PC.

01:31:09.548 --> 01:31:10.769
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the sex game.

01:31:11.509 --> 01:31:11.629
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

01:31:11.949 --> 01:31:27.477
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, this is the one where, like, I think you play these little spermy condom-looking guys, and, yeah, you have a Windows computer, and you can download this game now, and I guess it's a game that teaches you about... six.

01:31:27.657 --> 01:31:28.678
[SPEAKER_11]: Does it work with Kinect?

01:31:30.179 --> 01:31:31.139
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it's a PC game.

01:31:31.759 --> 01:31:32.160
[SPEAKER_11]: For now.

01:31:34.141 --> 01:31:34.641
[SPEAKER_11]: You never know.

01:31:36.041 --> 01:31:40.030
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see, TigerClaw305 sends us lots and lots of links tonight.

01:31:40.050 --> 01:31:41.654
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to do a couple of these here.

01:31:42.054 --> 01:31:42.576
[SPEAKER_11]: First off...

01:31:44.145 --> 01:31:45.645
[SPEAKER_11]: I think this is actually really cool.

01:31:45.725 --> 01:31:49.026
[SPEAKER_11]: All joking and laughing and boob talk aside, this is actually a really great story here.

01:31:49.386 --> 01:31:52.467
[SPEAKER_11]: The Kinect is going to be able to recognize sign language.

01:31:52.747 --> 01:31:54.388
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as you're not sitting on the couch.

01:31:56.488 --> 01:32:03.090
[SPEAKER_11]: The Kinect will actually recognize American sign language, and it's due to a patent, I guess, that's out there.

01:32:03.810 --> 01:32:08.412
[SPEAKER_11]: If you are proficient in sign language, you can actually get the Xbox 360 to recognize sign language.

01:32:09.372 --> 01:32:09.732
[SPEAKER_11]: I know a sign.

01:32:09.752 --> 01:32:11.173
[SPEAKER_11]: I know how to say bitch in sign language.

01:32:11.193 --> 01:32:11.554
[SPEAKER_11]: I bet you do.

01:32:11.574 --> 01:32:11.934
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

01:32:39.561 --> 01:32:41.502
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, I'm sure we know the same one, Dan.

01:32:41.863 --> 01:32:44.804
[SPEAKER_11]: This is less awesome, but this is something that Tiger Claw sends.

01:32:44.864 --> 01:32:45.945
[SPEAKER_11]: It must be reported on.

01:32:46.005 --> 01:32:46.585
[SPEAKER_11]: It is news.

01:32:47.346 --> 01:32:49.827
[SPEAKER_11]: Billy Mitchell has taken back the Donkey Kong record.

01:32:50.087 --> 01:32:50.647
[SPEAKER_11]: Both of them.

01:32:50.887 --> 01:32:53.409
[SPEAKER_11]: It happened on August 7th, 2010.

01:32:53.469 --> 01:32:56.551
[SPEAKER_11]: He reclaimed Donkey Kong and Donkey Kong Jr.

01:32:56.871 --> 01:32:59.112
[SPEAKER_01]: Billy Mitchell is laying the smackdown.

01:32:59.415 --> 01:33:04.097
[SPEAKER_11]: It happened at Boomers Grand Prix Arcade in Florida, verified live by Twin Galaxies refs.

01:33:18.243 --> 01:33:18.783
[SPEAKER_11]: That's it.

01:33:19.344 --> 01:33:21.625
[SPEAKER_11]: Two hours and 42 minutes for Donkey Kong.

01:33:21.685 --> 01:33:23.786
[SPEAKER_11]: Three hours and 58 minutes for Donkey Kong Jr.

01:33:25.226 --> 01:33:26.107
[SPEAKER_11]: I think I like this.

01:33:26.607 --> 01:33:30.969
[SPEAKER_11]: He stopped right after he got past Hank Chien's score.

01:33:31.549 --> 01:33:34.671
[SPEAKER_11]: And Mitchell said, quote, Some say I'm being cocky.

01:33:35.051 --> 01:33:36.492
[SPEAKER_11]: Some say I'm being lazy.

01:33:37.032 --> 01:33:39.173
[SPEAKER_11]: I say I'm being Billy Mitchell.

01:33:39.593 --> 01:33:42.835
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, because he wants to have that record broken again.

01:33:44.246 --> 01:33:52.815
[SPEAKER_01]: He wants to be able to keep one-upping it because he really does know that he is that much better than everybody else at Donkey Kong.

01:33:54.877 --> 01:33:58.180
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether you love Mitchell or you hate him, and you know you hate him.

01:33:58.420 --> 01:33:59.701
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody hates Billy Mitchell.

01:34:00.362 --> 01:34:05.147
[SPEAKER_01]: The guy is the best in the world at that game.

01:34:07.251 --> 01:34:13.013
[SPEAKER_11]: SSJ100 Matt sends us a tweet about NHL 11 because we love sports games here at OLR.

01:34:13.033 --> 01:34:14.933
[SPEAKER_11]: There's nothing we love more than sports games.

01:34:15.113 --> 01:34:15.794
[SPEAKER_01]: And how.

01:34:15.914 --> 01:34:20.295
[SPEAKER_11]: But I will say, if I'm going to play a sports game, why are there all these giggling women in the other room?

01:34:20.555 --> 01:34:23.656
[SPEAKER_03]: Because Mystique's on the phone with our friend Beanie and Beanie said they had tacos too.

01:34:24.276 --> 01:34:24.596
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.

01:34:24.896 --> 01:34:25.896
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it taco day?

01:34:25.976 --> 01:34:27.157
[SPEAKER_01]: It is taco day.

01:34:27.217 --> 01:34:30.157
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, the people in front of us at the supermarket were buying the ingredients.

01:34:30.197 --> 01:34:31.878
[SPEAKER_01]: We're buying the stuff to make Mexican food.

01:34:32.677 --> 01:34:33.978
[SPEAKER_01]: Did I miss the memo?

01:34:34.098 --> 01:34:35.598
[SPEAKER_01]: I was not aware it was Taco Day.

01:34:35.618 --> 01:34:37.179
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought Taco Day was Tuesday.

01:34:37.239 --> 01:34:38.139
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you're here.

01:34:38.739 --> 01:34:40.680
[SPEAKER_02]: You know who started that branding?

01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:41.000
[SPEAKER_11]: Huh?

01:34:41.280 --> 01:34:41.500
[SPEAKER_02]: Me.

01:34:42.041 --> 01:34:42.281
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you?

01:34:42.521 --> 01:34:43.481
[SPEAKER_02]: I started Taco Tuesday.

01:34:44.081 --> 01:34:44.722
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

01:34:44.762 --> 01:34:46.502
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there'd be some folks who might argue with that.

01:34:46.742 --> 01:34:47.383
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope, I did it.

01:34:47.623 --> 01:34:47.863
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

01:34:49.483 --> 01:34:50.084
[SPEAKER_02]: and the internet.

01:34:50.104 --> 01:34:51.345
[SPEAKER_11]: Can I talk about NHL 11?

01:34:51.565 --> 01:34:51.825
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

01:34:52.065 --> 01:34:53.066
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, NHL 11.

01:34:53.586 --> 01:34:55.008
[SPEAKER_11]: There is download content.

01:34:55.068 --> 01:34:58.410
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all priced between 80 and 160 Microsoft points.

01:34:58.891 --> 01:35:05.236
[SPEAKER_11]: They're like, I guess, player boosts where you can actually like give yourself high boosts of five and one and three and so forth.

01:35:05.556 --> 01:35:10.480
[SPEAKER_11]: Get this, 156 different pieces of download content.

01:35:10.540 --> 01:35:12.902
[SPEAKER_11]: Because EA doesn't have enough money.

01:35:13.723 --> 01:35:16.185
[SPEAKER_11]: And they also, well, they need it to buy a soul.

01:35:18.106 --> 01:35:18.546
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, whatever.

01:35:18.586 --> 01:35:19.206
[SPEAKER_11]: Apparently.

01:35:19.787 --> 01:35:21.487
[SPEAKER_01]: What would EA do with a soul but sell it?

01:35:21.507 --> 01:35:21.847
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

01:35:21.867 --> 01:35:23.408
[SPEAKER_11]: That's kind of screwed up, I guess.

01:35:23.428 --> 01:35:24.448
[SPEAKER_11]: For more Madden rights.

01:35:24.808 --> 01:35:27.329
[SPEAKER_11]: Because really, you're paying to basically make your characters better.

01:35:29.269 --> 01:35:29.569
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

01:35:29.670 --> 01:35:30.590
[SPEAKER_01]: Learn to play.

01:35:32.150 --> 01:35:35.791
[SPEAKER_11]: SSJ100 Matt in our chat says, Hockey is being derailed for tacos.

01:35:35.931 --> 01:35:36.692
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, the humanity.

01:35:37.072 --> 01:35:37.532
[SPEAKER_11]: Hacos.

01:35:39.429 --> 01:35:44.216
[SPEAKER_03]: Frisbee gets kudos for saying Billy Mitchell, I'm number one at making sauce.

01:35:44.757 --> 01:35:45.718
[SPEAKER_03]: Taco's own hockey.

01:35:45.738 --> 01:35:48.583
[SPEAKER_03]: Billy Mitchell, I'm saucy!

01:35:49.985 --> 01:35:51.788
[SPEAKER_03]: For real, he sells sauce on the internet.

01:35:53.132 --> 01:35:56.954
[SPEAKER_11]: I love the idea of a new sport called Hakos or Taki.

01:36:00.116 --> 01:36:02.378
[SPEAKER_11]: And it would be hockey played with tacos.

01:36:03.098 --> 01:36:05.059
[SPEAKER_11]: But they have to be like, you know, steel tacos.

01:36:05.339 --> 01:36:06.180
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

01:36:06.360 --> 01:36:07.721
[SPEAKER_11]: Steel tacos.

01:36:08.241 --> 01:36:09.442
[SPEAKER_11]: Blades of tacos.

01:36:09.922 --> 01:36:11.383
[SPEAKER_14]: Blades of tacos.

01:36:11.983 --> 01:36:12.263
[SPEAKER_10]: I got it.

01:36:12.343 --> 01:36:14.024
[SPEAKER_10]: I got it.

01:36:14.064 --> 01:36:16.326
[SPEAKER_10]: They skate on tacos.

01:36:19.027 --> 01:36:19.748
[SPEAKER_01]: That would get messy.

01:36:21.029 --> 01:36:21.549
[SPEAKER_11]: But that would be fun.

01:36:22.970 --> 01:36:24.852
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just getting into Dreamcast import gaming.

01:36:49.551 --> 01:36:52.092
[SPEAKER_11]: Boy, you're about 15 years late now.

01:36:52.192 --> 01:36:52.732
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kidding.

01:36:52.752 --> 01:36:53.812
[SPEAKER_02]: You want Blue Stinger.

01:36:54.232 --> 01:36:58.534
[SPEAKER_11]: What DC games not already out in the US somehow are worth importing?

01:36:58.954 --> 01:37:03.415
[SPEAKER_11]: The only Dreamcast imports I've got are Fire Pro Wrestling D and Giant Graham 2000.

01:37:04.095 --> 01:37:05.816
[SPEAKER_11]: Which means he spent eight bucks.

01:37:07.637 --> 01:37:09.517
[SPEAKER_11]: He probably downloaded them off the inner tubes.

01:37:09.677 --> 01:37:12.658
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, the Japanese version of Blue Stinger is better than the US one.

01:37:12.738 --> 01:37:15.659
[SPEAKER_01]: The Japanese version of Blue Stinger is much better than the US one.

01:37:16.559 --> 01:37:18.342
[SPEAKER_11]: What about, isn't it the Japanese?

01:37:18.422 --> 01:37:19.263
[SPEAKER_11]: No, that was on the Saturn.

01:37:19.283 --> 01:37:21.466
[SPEAKER_11]: I was thinking Symphony of the Night, but that's on the Saturn.

01:37:21.486 --> 01:37:22.207
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's on the Saturn.

01:37:22.728 --> 01:37:24.731
[SPEAKER_11]: What other import awesome Dreamcast games are there?

01:37:27.361 --> 01:37:28.461
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura's going to the vault.

01:37:28.621 --> 01:37:30.281
[SPEAKER_11]: There's almost too many to go into.

01:37:31.742 --> 01:37:34.483
[SPEAKER_11]: While DarkSakura runs to the vault, I will take other tweets.

01:37:34.623 --> 01:37:36.683
[SPEAKER_01]: She's going to come back with a bunch of terrible suggestions.

01:37:37.023 --> 01:37:39.084
[SPEAKER_11]: Spazinator sends us a tweet.

01:37:39.684 --> 01:37:43.105
[SPEAKER_11]: Apparently it's a leaked video of the Castlevania Lords of Shadow game.

01:37:43.425 --> 01:37:44.385
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, ha ha ha.

01:37:44.465 --> 01:37:46.266
[SPEAKER_11]: He tried to rickroll us, but I had it on mute.

01:37:46.326 --> 01:37:52.247
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why I usually don't click on YouTube links, but he cleverly disguised it behind a bit.

01:37:52.607 --> 01:37:52.868
[SPEAKER_03]: Kick him.

01:37:54.708 --> 01:37:56.370
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't kick somebody off Twitter.

01:37:56.410 --> 01:37:57.512
[SPEAKER_11]: If I could, I would for that.

01:37:58.413 --> 01:37:59.574
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I mean just kick him.

01:38:00.275 --> 01:38:02.838
[SPEAKER_03]: I think everything in this box came out in the U.S.

01:38:04.981 --> 01:38:07.684
[SPEAKER_03]: And why do we have two copies of Capcom vs. SNK?

01:38:08.845 --> 01:38:09.987
[SPEAKER_11]: Because we're that awesome?

01:38:10.107 --> 01:38:12.550
[SPEAKER_03]: No, one of them's the Pro Edition.

01:38:12.921 --> 01:38:13.342
[SPEAKER_11]: DJ Blaziken No

01:38:28.342 --> 01:38:29.502
[SPEAKER_01]: Neither has anybody else.

01:38:29.782 --> 01:38:35.284
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, apparently there is actually out there in the world an 8-bit version of DJ Hero.

01:38:35.584 --> 01:38:36.345
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the same guy.

01:38:36.385 --> 01:38:38.425
[SPEAKER_11]: He downgraded some other games on the NES, too.

01:38:38.725 --> 01:38:39.466
[SPEAKER_11]: Here it is, folks.

01:38:41.346 --> 01:38:43.867
[SPEAKER_01]: These videos are always so bad it gives me cancer.

01:38:51.789 --> 01:38:53.490
[SPEAKER_11]: What song is this?

01:38:53.530 --> 01:38:54.650
[SPEAKER_11]: Hang in tough.

01:38:54.730 --> 01:38:55.891
[SPEAKER_15]: What song is this?

01:38:56.291 --> 01:38:56.791
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

01:38:58.843 --> 01:38:59.363
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, it's Queen.

01:39:05.889 --> 01:39:07.810
[SPEAKER_01]: This game sucks bad.

01:39:08.571 --> 01:39:09.191
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody bought it.

01:39:10.632 --> 01:39:12.894
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it's not... You don't buy it, Dan.

01:39:12.934 --> 01:39:13.414
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a hack.

01:39:13.474 --> 01:39:15.876
[SPEAKER_11]: Or not a hack, but a... No, I'm just talking about DJ Hero.

01:39:17.077 --> 01:39:19.379
[SPEAKER_01]: You have no idea how hard I tried to sell that game.

01:39:19.839 --> 01:39:20.900
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what made it sell?

01:39:21.020 --> 01:39:22.481
[SPEAKER_01]: When it went down to like 80% off?

01:39:22.522 --> 01:39:24.363
[SPEAKER_11]: It sold like crazy and now it's a hit.

01:39:24.583 --> 01:39:25.244
[SPEAKER_11]: People bought it.

01:39:26.204 --> 01:39:26.445
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyhow.

01:39:27.563 --> 01:39:28.123
[SPEAKER_11]: One more tweet.

01:39:28.143 --> 01:39:29.524
[SPEAKER_11]: Can I do one more tweet?

01:39:29.544 --> 01:39:35.306
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, I did go through the box, and I think everything that we have in the box came out in the U.S., but P.O.P.O.

01:39:35.326 --> 01:39:36.407
[SPEAKER_03]: Da, I really like that game.

01:39:36.607 --> 01:39:37.267
[SPEAKER_11]: Hydra Thunder.

01:39:37.968 --> 01:39:38.228
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

01:39:38.708 --> 01:39:40.289
[SPEAKER_03]: It still not imports, Dan, you dork.

01:39:40.389 --> 01:39:43.190
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you can't say it and give Blue Swim at least, like, one or two suggestions.

01:39:43.470 --> 01:39:43.750
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

01:39:44.811 --> 01:39:45.191
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see.

01:39:45.211 --> 01:39:46.311
[SPEAKER_11]: Orange right.

01:39:48.516 --> 01:39:54.238
[SPEAKER_11]: I like that name because it almost makes it sound like it should be Orange LR is right or something like that.

01:39:54.538 --> 01:40:01.761
[SPEAKER_11]: Orange Right sends a tweet saying Konami is going to have a DDR party at Royal Tea Cafe to celebrate their first DDR for the PS3.

01:40:02.122 --> 01:40:04.543
[SPEAKER_11]: Naoki will be there live DJing.

01:40:04.683 --> 01:40:05.903
[SPEAKER_11]: I did hear about this actually.

01:40:06.643 --> 01:40:08.064
[SPEAKER_04]: Too far away or I would want to go.

01:40:08.224 --> 01:40:10.505
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's in Culver City, California, which is in SoCal.

01:40:10.545 --> 01:40:14.827
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a little far, especially for a weeknight because it's on August 12th, which is like this week.

01:40:15.547 --> 01:40:17.808
[SPEAKER_11]: But hey, if we have folks in the area, by all means, go.

01:40:18.308 --> 01:40:19.770
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to try to send DJ Tyrant.

01:40:19.950 --> 01:40:22.753
[SPEAKER_11]: He's in SoCal and he's done some freelancing for the website.

01:40:22.773 --> 01:40:25.516
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'll see if he can go and cover this for us.

01:40:25.937 --> 01:40:26.698
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have jobs.

01:40:26.738 --> 01:40:27.218
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going.

01:40:28.231 --> 01:40:28.992
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm just kidding.

01:40:29.112 --> 01:40:33.194
[SPEAKER_01]: We ain't got no money.

01:40:33.254 --> 01:40:34.175
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I know.

01:40:34.215 --> 01:40:35.736
[SPEAKER_11]: You could use the show funds.

01:40:36.116 --> 01:40:36.977
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, wait.

01:40:37.137 --> 01:40:38.098
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't have show funds.

01:40:38.978 --> 01:40:40.319
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been too poor to donate.

01:40:41.160 --> 01:40:42.801
[SPEAKER_11]: We had show funds once.

01:40:43.061 --> 01:40:44.122
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we have a soundboard.

01:40:44.142 --> 01:40:45.422
[SPEAKER_11]: Now we have a soundboard, exactly.

01:40:45.763 --> 01:40:47.504
[SPEAKER_11]: And I got to go to California Extreme two years ago.

01:40:47.584 --> 01:40:47.964
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

01:40:48.344 --> 01:40:50.085
[SPEAKER_11]: TigerClaw saying I missed one of his tweets.

01:40:50.125 --> 01:40:50.846
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry, TigerClaw.

01:40:50.866 --> 01:40:51.967
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a two-tweet maximum.

01:40:52.007 --> 01:40:52.467
[SPEAKER_01]: Too bad.

01:40:52.487 --> 01:40:53.187
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the problem.

01:40:54.088 --> 01:40:55.109
[SPEAKER_01]: How does it feel, huh?

01:40:55.409 --> 01:40:55.649
[SPEAKER_01]: Huh?

01:40:57.171 --> 01:40:59.092
[SPEAKER_11]: I appreciate what Tiger Claws does for the show.

01:40:59.192 --> 01:41:01.754
[SPEAKER_11]: I do, but I have to spread... It's not the Tiger Claws segment.

01:41:01.854 --> 01:41:04.577
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the Twitter Claws segment.

01:41:04.617 --> 01:41:05.878
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually said the Twitter Claws segment.

01:41:05.898 --> 01:41:07.179
[SPEAKER_11]: It is now the Tiger Claws segment.

01:41:08.300 --> 01:41:08.600
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

01:41:09.401 --> 01:41:10.622
[SPEAKER_11]: Just totally missed my point.

01:41:10.802 --> 01:41:12.103
[SPEAKER_11]: The Tiger Claw contingency.

01:41:12.163 --> 01:41:12.463
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

01:41:13.504 --> 01:41:15.044
[SPEAKER_11]: How about more news, shall we?

01:41:15.545 --> 01:41:16.005
[SPEAKER_10]: How about it?

01:41:35.117 --> 01:41:37.319
[SPEAKER_11]: Hold on, I have to, sorry for the dead air, but I have to bring this up.

01:41:37.339 --> 01:41:41.923
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, I need, I need music if I'm going to report on a story from Waterloo Labs here.

01:41:41.963 --> 01:41:44.205
[SPEAKER_11]: This is mandatory that I have a story here.

01:41:50.892 --> 01:41:56.737
[SPEAKER_08]: My, my, at Waterloo, they'll steal your fucking eyeballs.

01:41:57.077 --> 01:41:59.359
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, no, seriously, Waterloo Labs.

01:42:00.327 --> 01:42:07.867
[SPEAKER_11]: They have developed an electrode system that actually measures your eye movement and uses it to control Super Mario Bros.

01:42:09.571 --> 01:42:10.071
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right.

01:42:10.151 --> 01:42:11.191
[SPEAKER_11]: So look at this dude here.

01:42:11.251 --> 01:42:12.292
[SPEAKER_11]: He actually has his eyes.

01:42:12.652 --> 01:42:15.453
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, I'll stop the ABBA here for a minute and the listeners rejoice.

01:42:16.113 --> 01:42:18.073
[SPEAKER_11]: And you can actually watch this guy in this little video here.

01:42:18.093 --> 01:42:18.273
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, guys.

01:42:18.373 --> 01:42:19.574
[SPEAKER_15]: Welcome to Waterloo Labs.

01:42:20.114 --> 01:42:22.955
[SPEAKER_15]: This time we're going to use electrodes, LabVIEW, and a single board.

01:42:23.055 --> 01:42:23.455
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

01:42:23.475 --> 01:42:24.795
[SPEAKER_11]: Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

01:42:24.835 --> 01:42:27.656
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like they're in like a garage.

01:42:28.136 --> 01:42:30.197
[SPEAKER_01]: Not like a garage like at your house.

01:42:30.897 --> 01:42:33.618
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like when we were at the OLR studio.

01:42:34.138 --> 01:42:35.798
[SPEAKER_11]: We are at the OLR studio.

01:42:36.058 --> 01:42:37.919
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's just a spare bedroom.

01:42:38.179 --> 01:42:38.519
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

01:42:40.530 --> 01:42:40.870
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

01:42:40.890 --> 01:42:41.490
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?

01:42:41.510 --> 01:42:43.311
[SPEAKER_01]: But it doesn't look like these guys are in, like, their garage.

01:42:43.331 --> 01:42:45.372
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like they're in, like, a mechanic's garage.

01:42:45.472 --> 01:42:46.112
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hilarious.

01:42:46.172 --> 01:42:48.993
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want to see these guys, like, just talk about their stupid device.

01:42:49.033 --> 01:42:49.514
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to see that.

01:42:49.534 --> 01:42:49.894
[SPEAKER_11]: There we go.

01:42:49.914 --> 01:42:50.494
[SPEAKER_11]: There's the guy playing.

01:42:50.594 --> 01:42:51.054
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, my God.

01:42:51.094 --> 01:42:53.935
[SPEAKER_11]: He actually looks up to jump, and the guy does jump.

01:42:55.216 --> 01:42:58.317
[SPEAKER_11]: That is... And they kind of move their head a little bit, though.

01:42:58.337 --> 01:42:59.037
[SPEAKER_11]: That's kind of cheating.

01:42:59.057 --> 01:42:59.298
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

01:42:59.318 --> 01:43:00.558
[SPEAKER_11]: I bet he can't get to the minus world.

01:43:01.618 --> 01:43:04.900
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to see him run through 8-1, always running like that.

01:43:05.620 --> 01:43:06.640
[SPEAKER_11]: That is freaky to me.

01:43:06.660 --> 01:43:06.781
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, see?

01:43:06.801 --> 01:43:07.241
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at him die.

01:43:07.421 --> 01:43:07.941
[SPEAKER_01]: I was doing something.

01:43:08.666 --> 01:43:09.927
[SPEAKER_15]: Boo!

01:43:10.267 --> 01:43:12.229
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, Rob, though, you know they've had this before?

01:43:12.989 --> 01:43:13.210
[SPEAKER_15]: What?

01:43:13.270 --> 01:43:14.311
[SPEAKER_03]: The Atari Mind Link.

01:43:14.871 --> 01:43:15.712
[SPEAKER_01]: It never worked.

01:43:16.012 --> 01:43:21.016
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Atari in the 80s marketed a controller that was going to play by your brain waves.

01:43:21.476 --> 01:43:24.659
[SPEAKER_01]: But it actually played by the way that you moved your head.

01:43:24.959 --> 01:43:25.579
[SPEAKER_11]: Like your forehead?

01:43:25.860 --> 01:43:26.140
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

01:43:26.600 --> 01:43:27.141
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah, so it was a gimmick.

01:43:27.161 --> 01:43:28.262
[SPEAKER_03]: It worked on your eyebrow muscles.

01:43:28.602 --> 01:43:29.663
[SPEAKER_01]: It was snake oil.

01:43:30.003 --> 01:43:30.543
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

01:43:30.663 --> 01:43:31.324
[SPEAKER_01]: Never released.

01:43:31.584 --> 01:43:32.005
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a...

01:43:33.516 --> 01:43:34.836
[SPEAKER_01]: Famous, famous vaporware.

01:43:35.216 --> 01:43:38.377
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think Waterloo Labs actually plans to do anything with this.

01:43:38.397 --> 01:43:38.897
[SPEAKER_01]: Waterloo!

01:43:39.217 --> 01:43:39.977
[SPEAKER_11]: I know, right?

01:43:40.437 --> 01:43:41.557
[SPEAKER_11]: Napoleon did surrender.

01:43:41.817 --> 01:43:42.518
[SPEAKER_11]: Napoleon.

01:43:44.958 --> 01:43:50.739
[SPEAKER_11]: Whatever, it made for a great YouTube and got their little lab all over blogs and on our show, so congrats, there you go.

01:43:51.959 --> 01:44:02.181
[SPEAKER_03]: This website, though, that I've tried to find the picture on, it actually shows some Atari wireless controllers that have these big antennas and this thing, and then an orthopedic shoe, and it's labeled, which one is the orthopedic shoe?

01:44:04.527 --> 01:44:12.756
[SPEAKER_11]: It looks like somebody in our chatroom, MOTC, I don't know if that's short for something, sorry, is like going crazy trying to get the DDR event information.

01:44:12.816 --> 01:44:15.679
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you're going, I want a phone call next week, dude.

01:44:17.361 --> 01:44:21.986
[SPEAKER_11]: And by the way, Orange Wright actually joined our chatroom and actually changed the name to Orange LR is right.

01:44:22.026 --> 01:44:22.446
[SPEAKER_11]: So there we go.

01:44:23.207 --> 01:44:23.507
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

01:44:24.408 --> 01:44:25.029
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

01:44:25.049 --> 01:44:25.329
[SPEAKER_11]: Appreciate it.

01:44:25.369 --> 01:44:26.150
[SPEAKER_01]: Well done, sir.

01:44:26.330 --> 01:44:26.771
[SPEAKER_01]: Well done.

01:44:27.771 --> 01:44:33.613
[SPEAKER_11]: and Tiger Claw, like the Google Ninja he is, right there with the Wikipedia article to the Atari Mine link.

01:44:34.274 --> 01:44:36.555
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to see a picture of this thing and see if it was scary looking.

01:44:37.235 --> 01:44:38.476
[SPEAKER_01]: I posted one in the chat room.

01:44:38.516 --> 01:44:39.816
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to the Atari History Museum.

01:44:39.996 --> 01:44:40.576
[SPEAKER_11]: Hold on, hold on.

01:44:41.697 --> 01:44:42.777
[SPEAKER_08]: The link is on the Wikipedia.

01:44:42.797 --> 01:44:44.178
[SPEAKER_11]: Hold on, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it.

01:44:45.799 --> 01:44:49.700
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see.

01:44:49.820 --> 01:44:50.621
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I see it, there it is.

01:44:51.221 --> 01:44:52.381
[SPEAKER_11]: That looks dumb.

01:44:53.462 --> 01:44:54.262
[SPEAKER_03]: It was.

01:44:54.282 --> 01:44:55.263
[SPEAKER_03]: That made for great radio.

01:44:55.283 --> 01:44:55.823
[SPEAKER_11]: It never worked.

01:44:57.230 --> 01:44:57.450
[SPEAKER_11]: Mind Maze

01:45:11.286 --> 01:45:12.047
[SPEAKER_11]: SkipSchool.

01:45:12.127 --> 01:45:12.548
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I'm kidding.

01:45:12.568 --> 01:45:12.988
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm kidding.

01:45:13.108 --> 01:45:13.469
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm kidding.

01:45:13.549 --> 01:45:13.849
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm kidding.

01:45:13.869 --> 01:45:14.270
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm kidding.

01:45:14.851 --> 01:45:17.434
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

01:45:17.775 --> 01:45:18.295
[SPEAKER_03]: Stuff.

01:45:19.777 --> 01:45:22.601
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, this is something that perhaps Dan might be interested in.

01:45:23.061 --> 01:45:23.402
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

01:45:24.003 --> 01:45:24.423
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

01:45:25.905 --> 01:45:29.410
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, actually, he couldn't do anything with it because it's only for Europe.

01:45:30.370 --> 01:45:36.976
[SPEAKER_03]: Gran Turismo 5, the European special editions, have two special editions, actually.

01:45:37.416 --> 01:45:39.818
[SPEAKER_03]: There's the signature edition that's like the U.S.

01:45:39.858 --> 01:45:40.659
[SPEAKER_03]: collector's edition.

01:45:41.139 --> 01:45:44.682
[SPEAKER_03]: It has a metal case, a miniature SLS AMG.

01:45:45.763 --> 01:45:47.184
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes with a toy car.

01:45:48.425 --> 01:45:48.906
[SPEAKER_03]: Model car.

01:45:49.426 --> 01:45:50.807
[SPEAKER_11]: It comes with a V6 engine.

01:45:52.148 --> 01:46:07.321
[SPEAKER_03]: A USB flash drive, a wallet, and an entry into a contest to win a Mercedes-Benz, and vouchers for 11 download content vehicles, a key fob, an art book, a driving strategy mini magazine, and it's going to be €179.99.

01:46:09.343 --> 01:46:10.865
[SPEAKER_01]: There's another special edition, too.

01:46:11.125 --> 01:46:12.026
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all that stuff.

01:46:12.606 --> 01:46:15.709
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes with the trunk of a Z06 Corvette, and it costs $70,000.

01:46:18.610 --> 01:46:22.412
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's another one if you don't have as much money, which is €79.99.

01:46:23.253 --> 01:46:36.741
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the collector's edition that has a slipcover, some art cards, the download content vouchers, and the driving magazines that came with the other version.

01:46:37.381 --> 01:46:45.286
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can decide if you want to have the cool version or the, oh my god, can I win the Mercedes version?

01:46:45.726 --> 01:46:47.127
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's keep in mind, that's Euro.

01:46:47.447 --> 01:46:47.647
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

01:46:47.807 --> 01:46:51.448
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's like, what, a buck and a half, a buck seventy-five per Euro?

01:46:51.589 --> 01:46:54.890
[SPEAKER_11]: Or you could just buy the goddamn game by itself and be happy with it.

01:46:55.150 --> 01:46:56.270
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll do the conversion right now.

01:46:57.471 --> 01:46:58.291
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to get the U.S.

01:46:58.351 --> 01:47:00.332
[SPEAKER_01]: Collector's Edition, but I don't think I'm going to spring for it.

01:47:00.352 --> 01:47:00.912
[SPEAKER_01]: What's in the U.S.

01:47:00.932 --> 01:47:01.593
[SPEAKER_01]: Collector's Edition?

01:47:03.454 --> 01:47:11.457
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes with a toy car, a bunch of DLC, art book, a book, a soundtrack, just all kinds of stuff.

01:47:12.137 --> 01:47:13.958
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like Gran Turismo, and I'm like...

01:47:14.306 --> 01:47:15.929
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, I'll do that.

01:47:15.949 --> 01:47:16.850
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I'm like, what?

01:47:16.930 --> 01:47:18.052
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like $150.

01:47:19.053 --> 01:47:19.815
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesus, no.

01:47:21.177 --> 01:47:21.477
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

01:47:22.118 --> 01:47:25.003
[SPEAKER_11]: Going to another game that's coming out later this year here in the U.S.

01:47:25.043 --> 01:47:25.523
[SPEAKER_11]: and the U.K.

01:47:25.824 --> 01:47:27.066
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's in the U.K.

01:47:27.086 --> 01:47:27.346
[SPEAKER_11]: this year.

01:47:27.366 --> 01:47:27.787
[SPEAKER_11]: Hmm?

01:47:30.089 --> 01:47:31.251
[SPEAKER_11]: 240 bucks to DarkSakura.

01:47:31.271 --> 01:47:31.852
[SPEAKER_11]: Got some money.

01:47:32.372 --> 01:47:38.321
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, hey, a new mode in GoldenEye that kind of throws you back to an old mode.

01:47:38.361 --> 01:47:38.801
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's the thing.

01:47:39.082 --> 01:47:43.488
[SPEAKER_11]: There used to be a mode, if you remember, in GoldenEye on the N64, it was called DK mode.

01:47:43.788 --> 01:47:46.692
[SPEAKER_11]: And that was the mode where you would all have the giant heads.

01:47:47.793 --> 01:47:51.815
[SPEAKER_11]: It made all the enemies and people in the game have these gigantic heads.

01:47:52.236 --> 01:47:55.377
[SPEAKER_11]: And they all had what they would call the proportions of Donkey Kong.

01:47:55.637 --> 01:48:01.360
[SPEAKER_11]: Because at that time, Rare was making, of course, this game and they were making the Donkey Kong games on Super Nintendo, right?

01:48:01.440 --> 01:48:03.301
[SPEAKER_11]: So is Donkey Kong mode coming back?

01:48:04.001 --> 01:48:05.282
[SPEAKER_11]: No, of course not, stupid.

01:48:05.302 --> 01:48:08.624
[SPEAKER_11]: Because Activision has the rights now and they don't own the rights to Donkey Kong.

01:48:08.924 --> 01:48:10.124
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's not coming back.

01:48:10.605 --> 01:48:16.628
[SPEAKER_11]: But what they did, and this is clever, they've decided to do, instead of big heads, they now have...

01:48:17.248 --> 01:48:18.710
[SPEAKER_11]: Big Hands!

01:48:19.291 --> 01:48:33.771
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right, there's a Big Hands mode that can be activated in multiplayer and you get Big Hands and this is it, you can only melee people so it is bitch slap mode basically you can only bitch slap the other players with your giant hands that is what it is

01:48:35.979 --> 01:48:36.319
[SPEAKER_11]: Awesome.

01:48:36.940 --> 01:48:41.885
[SPEAKER_11]: There also, by the way, is a mode that makes everybody tiny that I believe was in the old game as well.

01:48:41.945 --> 01:48:43.707
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a knick-knack mode is what it's called.

01:48:44.247 --> 01:48:49.353
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I alone in being a lot less interested in that game when they're like, yeah, we're going to redo Goldeneye.

01:48:49.713 --> 01:48:50.434
[SPEAKER_01]: Yay!

01:48:50.834 --> 01:48:53.857
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, we're going to take Pierce Brosnan out and we're going to put Daniel Craig in.

01:48:54.518 --> 01:48:55.138
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, that's...

01:48:56.785 --> 01:48:57.466
[SPEAKER_01]: That's interesting.

01:48:57.526 --> 01:48:58.267
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not a big deal.

01:48:58.507 --> 01:48:58.988
[SPEAKER_11]: Whatever.

01:49:00.409 --> 01:49:01.510
[SPEAKER_11]: Those Bond movies were fine.

01:49:01.630 --> 01:49:02.932
[SPEAKER_11]: The new ones were fine.

01:49:03.572 --> 01:49:04.053
[SPEAKER_01]: They're awesome.

01:49:04.073 --> 01:49:06.055
[SPEAKER_11]: But Goldeneye is Brosnan's movie.

01:49:06.996 --> 01:49:08.858
[SPEAKER_11]: I know, it's weird, but you know.

01:49:09.178 --> 01:49:11.681
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the whole thing is likeness rights.

01:49:12.041 --> 01:49:14.383
[SPEAKER_11]: I played it at E3, and I'll just say it doesn't even matter.

01:49:14.403 --> 01:49:15.685
[SPEAKER_11]: Brosnan's a whore for money.

01:49:16.065 --> 01:49:19.629
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all about Oddjob anyway, because he throws the hat, and it's awesome.

01:49:20.650 --> 01:49:22.010
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a shoe, honestly.

01:49:22.070 --> 01:49:22.591
[SPEAKER_11]: Honestly.

01:49:23.031 --> 01:49:24.111
[SPEAKER_11]: You fight like a woman.

01:49:24.891 --> 01:49:30.032
[SPEAKER_11]: Frisbee in our chatroom is a little upset saying you can't claim ownership on big heads and hands, etc.

01:49:31.053 --> 01:49:33.133
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe it was just they just didn't want to go there.

01:49:34.534 --> 01:49:36.294
[SPEAKER_11]: It's too close or something.

01:49:36.314 --> 01:49:38.595
[SPEAKER_01]: The conglomerate that owns what's left of Midway should sue.

01:49:40.040 --> 01:49:40.881
[SPEAKER_01]: Except it was a rare game.

01:49:41.502 --> 01:49:41.883
[SPEAKER_01]: Not Midway.

01:49:42.003 --> 01:49:45.428
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, but Midway, the big heads thing came along at NBA Jam.

01:49:46.489 --> 01:49:47.931
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, true.

01:49:47.951 --> 01:49:49.393
[SPEAKER_01]: Back to NBA Jam again.

01:49:49.573 --> 01:49:50.234
[SPEAKER_03]: Shut up, Dan.

01:49:50.575 --> 01:49:50.835
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

01:49:52.583 --> 01:49:53.083
[SPEAKER_11]: Shut up, Dan.

01:49:53.123 --> 01:49:54.184
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's do another news story.

01:49:54.664 --> 01:49:58.807
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, for those who are looking forward to Pokemon Black and White, they haven't already... Hey, Dan, here you go.

01:49:59.307 --> 01:49:59.807
[SPEAKER_03]: Woo, Pokemon.

01:49:59.827 --> 01:50:00.407
[SPEAKER_03]: And how.

01:50:01.068 --> 01:50:02.609
[SPEAKER_03]: They haven't already imported it.

01:50:03.309 --> 01:50:06.031
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

01:50:07.852 --> 01:50:12.254
[SPEAKER_03]: When you play through it the first time, until you beat it, you can only use the new Pokemon.

01:50:12.834 --> 01:50:14.135
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't get the old Pokemon.

01:50:14.815 --> 01:50:15.416
[SPEAKER_03]: No, Pika.

01:50:16.236 --> 01:50:16.797
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell?

01:50:16.837 --> 01:50:17.257
[SPEAKER_03]: Pika.

01:50:18.345 --> 01:50:19.146
[SPEAKER_03]: Not until you beat the game.

01:50:19.926 --> 01:50:20.967
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you can get some people.

01:50:21.367 --> 01:50:23.048
[SPEAKER_11]: Look, I understand why they're fighting.

01:50:23.068 --> 01:50:25.710
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, there's a lot of fucking Pokemon at this point, right?

01:50:25.730 --> 01:50:27.031
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, how many Pokemon are there now?

01:50:27.071 --> 01:50:28.912
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, 700 fucking Pokemon or something?

01:50:28.932 --> 01:50:30.593
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, it's just, it's insane.

01:50:30.613 --> 01:50:32.474
[SPEAKER_11]: And they're all starting to be like parodies of each other.

01:50:33.135 --> 01:50:41.300
[SPEAKER_11]: I would actually sympathize with Nintendo if they wanted to say, hey, look, new game, new system, new, or actually, did they have another DS?

01:50:41.340 --> 01:50:41.581
[SPEAKER_11]: Whatever.

01:50:41.901 --> 01:50:44.683
[SPEAKER_11]: New way of playing, new game, new Pokemon.

01:50:45.083 --> 01:50:46.564
[SPEAKER_11]: Stop asking for the old shit.

01:50:46.624 --> 01:50:47.825
[SPEAKER_03]: I still want an actual Pokemon MMO.

01:50:48.585 --> 01:50:52.349
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's weird that they kind of put the Pokemon in there anyway at the end.

01:50:52.370 --> 01:50:53.771
[SPEAKER_11]: But I guess it's a reward to beat the game.

01:50:54.552 --> 01:50:54.892
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess.

01:50:54.912 --> 01:50:55.253
[SPEAKER_11]: There you go.

01:50:55.893 --> 01:50:57.255
[SPEAKER_03]: I still want a Pokemon MMO.

01:50:57.315 --> 01:50:57.896
[SPEAKER_03]: I would play that.

01:50:58.216 --> 01:51:02.461
[SPEAKER_11]: Every time there's a Pokemon story on this show, somebody says, why don't they make this an MMO already?

01:51:02.841 --> 01:51:03.722
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a very good question.

01:51:03.742 --> 01:51:05.124
[SPEAKER_01]: Because a Pokemon Momo would work.

01:51:06.305 --> 01:51:07.386
[SPEAKER_11]: A Pokemon Momo?

01:51:08.708 --> 01:51:09.488
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that like a Moo Moo?

01:51:09.629 --> 01:51:09.749
[SPEAKER_11]: Momo.

01:51:09.769 --> 01:51:09.849
[SPEAKER_11]: Momo.

01:51:11.946 --> 01:51:13.387
[SPEAKER_11]: A Pokemon MMO would be great.

01:51:13.507 --> 01:51:13.888
[SPEAKER_11]: It would be.

01:51:13.988 --> 01:51:21.614
[SPEAKER_11]: But it would be weird because Nintendo, in their mission to protect children across the world with friends codes, how in the hell would an MMO work?

01:51:22.175 --> 01:51:24.817
[SPEAKER_11]: And they keep it like kid-friendly, quote-unquote.

01:51:24.837 --> 01:51:28.320
[SPEAKER_11]: Would it be like the Disney game where you can only say certain phrases to people?

01:51:29.041 --> 01:51:29.301
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

01:51:29.321 --> 01:51:30.262
[SPEAKER_11]: It would have to be what would happen.

01:51:30.642 --> 01:51:31.543
[SPEAKER_01]: That ain't my problem.

01:51:31.823 --> 01:51:33.565
[SPEAKER_01]: I just think that a Pokemon MMO would work.

01:51:33.965 --> 01:51:34.546
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, well, okay.

01:51:35.163 --> 01:51:35.964
[SPEAKER_04]: Screw the kids.

01:51:36.344 --> 01:51:36.685
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.

01:51:36.725 --> 01:51:37.406
[SPEAKER_01]: Screw the kids.

01:51:37.666 --> 01:51:38.367
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right, Misty.

01:51:38.447 --> 01:51:44.874
[SPEAKER_01]: I would play the Pokemon MMO while I ate my Nintendo cereal system and my Nintendo pajamas.

01:51:45.594 --> 01:51:46.295
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd be awesome.

01:51:47.637 --> 01:51:47.937
[SPEAKER_11]: Amen.

01:51:48.936 --> 01:51:50.237
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a broken computer.

01:52:08.796 --> 01:52:09.497
[SPEAKER_11]: And you're a fool.

01:52:28.390 --> 01:52:33.853
[SPEAKER_11]: Torchlight 2 is going to go above ground and it's now going to be on the continent of Vildoran.

01:52:34.193 --> 01:52:39.856
[SPEAKER_11]: There will still be deep caverns, but there will also be weather, time of day cycles, and random events.

01:52:39.876 --> 01:52:45.159
[SPEAKER_11]: You're going to be able to play online and, those of you that feel burned by Blizzard, LAN.

01:52:45.779 --> 01:52:47.460
[SPEAKER_11]: LAN parties for Torchlight 2.

01:52:47.520 --> 01:52:47.960
[SPEAKER_11]: There you go.

01:52:48.100 --> 01:52:48.660
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.

01:52:48.680 --> 01:52:51.322
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll totally have features that every other game already has.

01:52:51.402 --> 01:52:52.582
[SPEAKER_01]: Except StarCraft 2.

01:52:52.682 --> 01:52:53.223
[SPEAKER_01]: Score!

01:52:54.241 --> 01:52:55.904
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you can't play StarCraft 2 in it.

01:52:56.485 --> 01:52:58.068
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you can't play StarCraft 2 on LAN.

01:52:58.810 --> 01:53:00.072
[SPEAKER_01]: They took LAN out of StarCraft 2.

01:53:00.393 --> 01:53:01.575
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of a big deal.

01:53:01.595 --> 01:53:02.877
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, no, I know that.

01:53:02.917 --> 01:53:03.779
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, just making sure.

01:53:04.383 --> 01:53:24.575
[SPEAKER_11]: there will be a free peer-to-peer matchmaking service to meet new players of similar level and interest now I had heard that they were going to do an MMO about this I guess that is also still in development it's a free-to-play Torchlight MMO this is not the same game but there is a multiplayer Torchlight game on the way in 2011 I think that's exciting to me I don't know about you guys

01:53:25.635 --> 01:53:26.116
[SPEAKER_11]: So there you go.

01:53:26.796 --> 01:53:27.256
[SPEAKER_01]: So sweet.

01:53:27.577 --> 01:53:27.877
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

01:53:28.357 --> 01:53:31.419
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, now is the mailbag part of the show, except Jamie's not here.

01:53:31.559 --> 01:53:35.021
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're going to set the mailbag on fire, ladies and gentlemen.

01:53:35.061 --> 01:53:37.382
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn, where did I put my lighter?

01:53:41.785 --> 01:53:47.868
[SPEAKER_11]: Every week, DarkSakura opens up the email bag at mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com and she reads some emails for us.

01:53:47.928 --> 01:53:50.610
[SPEAKER_11]: We listen to them live as she reads them for us.

01:53:50.630 --> 01:53:52.991
[SPEAKER_11]: So DarkSakura, why don't you go ahead and read us an email?

01:53:56.954 --> 01:53:58.075
[SPEAKER_01]: This is some great radio right here.

01:53:58.095 --> 01:53:58.315
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

01:53:58.856 --> 01:53:59.236
[SPEAKER_03]: Mailbag.

01:53:59.256 --> 01:53:59.617
[SPEAKER_01]: Mailbag.

01:54:00.097 --> 01:54:00.898
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's not mailbag.

01:54:00.918 --> 01:54:01.638
[SPEAKER_03]: I had another story.

01:54:02.780 --> 01:54:03.340
[SPEAKER_01]: Not anymore.

01:54:04.181 --> 01:54:04.461
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

01:54:04.801 --> 01:54:05.282
[SPEAKER_01]: The music's playing.

01:54:05.302 --> 01:54:05.762
[SPEAKER_01]: Read the mail.

01:54:06.663 --> 01:54:07.064
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, come on.

01:54:07.104 --> 01:54:07.544
[SPEAKER_01]: Get to it.

01:54:07.564 --> 01:54:07.824
[SPEAKER_01]: Fine.

01:54:08.525 --> 01:54:08.905
[SPEAKER_01]: Fine.

01:54:08.965 --> 01:54:09.386
[SPEAKER_01]: Mail time.

01:54:10.447 --> 01:54:10.867
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

01:54:10.887 --> 01:54:11.268
[SPEAKER_01]: Mail call.

01:54:12.869 --> 01:54:13.310
[SPEAKER_01]: Land shark.

01:54:15.251 --> 01:54:16.352
[SPEAKER_04]: Mail call beats a booty call.

01:54:18.194 --> 01:54:18.635
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, how you doing?

01:54:18.975 --> 01:54:21.637
[SPEAKER_03]: The window's actually closed and I don't know who closed it, so whatever.

01:54:21.858 --> 01:54:22.138
[SPEAKER_03]: It was me.

01:54:25.379 --> 01:54:26.200
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, we can go with that.

01:54:26.940 --> 01:54:29.381
[SPEAKER_11]: Dan, why don't you pretend you're emailing Orange Lounge Radio?

01:54:29.402 --> 01:54:31.043
[SPEAKER_11]: What would you say in an email to Orange Lounge Radio?

01:54:31.183 --> 01:54:31.703
[SPEAKER_01]: Email's up.

01:54:32.003 --> 01:54:32.844
[SPEAKER_01]: Dear Rob.

01:54:33.344 --> 01:54:33.944
[SPEAKER_01]: Shut up, Dan.

01:54:34.024 --> 01:54:35.505
[SPEAKER_01]: Dan should be on this show way more often.

01:54:35.525 --> 01:54:36.346
[SPEAKER_01]: For real, Dan, shut up.

01:54:36.446 --> 01:54:38.107
[SPEAKER_01]: He is so cool and such a pimp.

01:54:38.752 --> 01:54:43.457
[SPEAKER_03]: Your little OLR crew, Blade3 here, just wanted to say keep up the great work with the shows.

01:54:44.317 --> 01:54:45.378
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't... Shows?

01:54:45.879 --> 01:54:46.760
[SPEAKER_03]: We have more than one show?

01:54:47.200 --> 01:54:48.101
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't live without them.

01:54:48.541 --> 01:54:51.644
[SPEAKER_03]: Your show-wa, not shows, show-wa.

01:54:52.205 --> 01:54:52.946
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like more shows.

01:54:53.826 --> 01:54:57.350
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep my week going, and with school starting this week, I'll need you more than ever.

01:54:57.390 --> 01:55:01.634
[SPEAKER_03]: And by the way, PlayStation Move is stupid, and I think Loki should smack everyone who buys one when he gets back.

01:55:01.654 --> 01:55:01.894
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.

01:55:03.295 --> 01:55:03.776
[SPEAKER_03]: Punctuation.

01:55:04.113 --> 01:55:05.374
[SPEAKER_01]: Loki's never coming back.

01:55:06.015 --> 01:55:06.655
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, he is.

01:55:06.695 --> 01:55:07.216
[SPEAKER_01]: He's coming.

01:55:07.236 --> 01:55:07.916
[SPEAKER_01]: The era of Dan has begun.

01:55:08.097 --> 01:55:08.617
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, God.

01:55:08.697 --> 01:55:09.778
[SPEAKER_11]: Help us all.

01:55:10.419 --> 01:55:15.263
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, there's only one show, but I think he means shows as in, you know, there's been 377 episodes.

01:55:15.603 --> 01:55:20.408
[SPEAKER_11]: Although, I will say, Extifer and I really want to do the other show, and I think I have a great concept now.

01:55:20.448 --> 01:55:20.968
[SPEAKER_03]: And we still...

01:55:22.509 --> 01:55:48.864
[SPEAKER_11]: now that I don't have school on the nights you had available I would like to do that still, it would be fun I want to do a show the Dan show not by myself what would a Dan show sound like if Dan was by himself with a microphone I have a mic words see the Dan and Mystique show oh shit all who oppose us would perish

01:55:50.669 --> 01:55:51.690
[SPEAKER_03]: Second email!

01:55:51.870 --> 01:55:54.152
[SPEAKER_03]: Greetings, number one show in the continental US.

01:55:55.113 --> 01:55:55.393
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

01:55:55.493 --> 01:55:56.514
[SPEAKER_03]: We're the greatest in the galaxy.

01:55:56.734 --> 01:55:58.435
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we're actually the greatest in the galaxy.

01:55:58.975 --> 01:56:01.577
[SPEAKER_11]: Although, when we had that decree... Do you have the decree?

01:56:01.957 --> 01:56:02.358
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I do.

01:56:02.538 --> 01:56:04.800
[SPEAKER_11]: The decree does not say the number one.

01:56:05.380 --> 01:56:06.701
[SPEAKER_11]: It just says the official.

01:56:06.721 --> 01:56:07.662
[SPEAKER_03]: I had tape stuck to it.

01:56:09.980 --> 01:56:10.680
[SPEAKER_11]: But I'll take number one.

01:56:10.700 --> 01:56:11.741
[SPEAKER_11]: What is going on over there?

01:56:11.861 --> 01:56:12.681
[SPEAKER_03]: Official decree.

01:56:12.801 --> 01:56:16.662
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge Radio is the official video game podcast of the galaxy forever.

01:56:16.682 --> 01:56:17.902
[SPEAKER_11]: Galaxy forever.

01:56:18.163 --> 01:56:21.664
[SPEAKER_11]: It doesn't say number one video game podcast, but it is the official video game podcast.

01:56:21.684 --> 01:56:26.865
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that we have been voted the number one show in the continental U.S., I guess Hawaii would beat us or something.

01:56:27.045 --> 01:56:29.006
[SPEAKER_11]: Meaning like all those one-up shows?

01:56:29.286 --> 01:56:29.706
[SPEAKER_11]: Unofficial.

01:56:30.286 --> 01:56:30.666
[SPEAKER_11]: Unofficial.

01:56:30.706 --> 01:56:31.387
[SPEAKER_11]: Not official.

01:56:31.627 --> 01:56:32.267
[SPEAKER_11]: GameSpot?

01:56:32.427 --> 01:56:32.867
[SPEAKER_11]: Unofficial.

01:56:32.967 --> 01:56:33.627
[SPEAKER_11]: Not official.

01:56:33.647 --> 01:56:34.047
[SPEAKER_11]: Giant Bomb?

01:56:34.167 --> 01:56:34.888
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not official.

01:56:34.908 --> 01:56:35.588
[SPEAKER_11]: Totally not official.

01:56:36.128 --> 01:56:37.368
[SPEAKER_03]: Reading the email.

01:56:38.089 --> 01:56:44.090
[SPEAKER_03]: I just heard a story on NPR about talks between Google and Verizon about paying extra for used bandwidth.

01:56:44.770 --> 01:56:49.651
[SPEAKER_03]: Decided that people who stream video, music, and especially online gamers will pay a lot extra for the bandwidth used.

01:56:50.171 --> 01:56:53.352
[SPEAKER_03]: This is very troubling to me since I'm an online gamer primarily.

01:56:53.752 --> 01:56:59.094
[SPEAKER_03]: Google seems to be the last straw, and if they give in, all the dominoes will start falling.

01:56:59.434 --> 01:57:04.535
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm wondering why I haven't heard more of an outcry from the gamer community about this bandwidth issue.

01:57:05.175 --> 01:57:12.261
[SPEAKER_03]: Since it has been behind the scenes for a while now, I also wonder what game studios and developers think of this.

01:57:13.322 --> 01:57:15.663
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what I'll do if rates go up anymore.

01:57:15.763 --> 01:57:16.564
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you guys think?

01:57:18.345 --> 01:57:20.907
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, you are the podcast that I look forward to all week.

01:57:20.947 --> 01:57:22.689
[SPEAKER_03]: You're loyal turtle in Philly.

01:57:22.849 --> 01:57:23.369
[SPEAKER_03]: Serious turtle.

01:57:23.389 --> 01:57:24.370
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you say turdy?

01:57:25.031 --> 01:57:27.372
[SPEAKER_03]: I was saying Philly when I said turtle, so shut up.

01:57:27.392 --> 01:57:29.334
[SPEAKER_01]: Wouldn't that come out as tilly?

01:57:30.652 --> 01:57:31.372
[SPEAKER_11]: Dan, you had a comment?

01:57:49.478 --> 01:58:17.698
[SPEAKER_11]: ultimately at the end of the day it's going to be your dollars that decide the other thing to keep in mind cable is slowly spreading through more and more neighborhoods and so forth and if you're also willing to make the sacrifice to go to something like DSL which might not be as fast perhaps there will be DSL competitors that are going to have an open internet that won't charge for this stuff AT&T still competes with Comcast still competes with neighborhood providers and so forth don't get me wrong folks I think this sucks too

01:58:18.779 --> 01:58:27.968
[SPEAKER_11]: but I'm just saying it might not be like you know eternal damnation for all of us I mean like there's going to be a limit that people are going to hit and they'll just cancel it

01:58:28.612 --> 01:58:29.552
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, because it's already started.

01:58:29.752 --> 01:58:32.473
[SPEAKER_01]: The phone companies are doing it, you know.

01:58:33.013 --> 01:58:39.135
[SPEAKER_01]: But there will always be somebody out there who's going to say, hey, you pay a little bit more and you can be unlimited.

01:58:39.655 --> 01:58:42.096
[SPEAKER_01]: The hope is that two things will happen.

01:58:42.156 --> 01:58:49.157
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one, competition will keep things cheap, you know, because there is more than one answer.

01:58:49.537 --> 01:58:54.699
[SPEAKER_01]: So if cable says, okay, we're charging you and DSL says, oh, no, we're not.

01:58:55.419 --> 01:59:23.534
[SPEAKER_01]: you know everybody will jump over to DSL and cable will lose all their money so they'll come back around the other thing that you're kind of looking at with the whole cable or with the whole unlimited bandwidth thing is that there are you know god help us government factions and that at work where the argument is that because the internet now is practically essential for life that they'll get involved to keep price gouging from happening you know

01:59:24.014 --> 01:59:50.383
[SPEAKER_01]: but who knows what's going to happen the truth is we're just going to have to gamers, online people the BitTorrent people who are the ones who are really screwed it up for everybody by sucking down massive amounts of bandwidth 24-7, 365 yeah, you heard that what's going to really happen is we're all going to have to deal with it and hopefully we don't get punked too hard

01:59:51.488 --> 01:59:54.591
[SPEAKER_11]: I would think they'd go after the Torrenters first, but I don't know.

02:00:14.304 --> 02:00:18.870
[SPEAKER_01]: Their other, you know, their movie studio, TV studio, whatever connections.

02:00:19.511 --> 02:00:21.413
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, they, yeah, they want the band.

02:00:21.553 --> 02:00:24.777
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus, you know, anything they can get away with charging us a little bit more money.

02:00:24.957 --> 02:00:26.239
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they want that money.

02:00:26.920 --> 02:00:27.841
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me that money.

02:00:28.742 --> 02:00:29.383
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me all your money.

02:00:29.583 --> 02:00:30.204
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me all your money.

02:00:30.384 --> 02:00:31.125
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me your money.

02:00:31.826 --> 02:00:33.948
[SPEAKER_11]: Well that's, uh, is that it for the email bag tonight?

02:00:34.348 --> 02:00:34.828
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes it is.

02:00:35.008 --> 02:00:44.195
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com if you want to send us an email in the future and hopefully you won't have to pay extra money through Comcast or whoever your service provider is to do so.

02:00:44.795 --> 02:00:45.756
[SPEAKER_11]: I know it's still free right now.

02:00:47.157 --> 02:00:51.240
[SPEAKER_11]: In the meantime, how about some angst, some anger, some F-U's.

02:00:51.480 --> 02:00:52.381
[SPEAKER_11]: Hold on, hold on, hold on.

02:01:06.901 --> 02:01:08.262
[SPEAKER_03]: F you to my software shield.

02:01:09.882 --> 02:01:10.743
[SPEAKER_03]: I defeated you!

02:01:12.323 --> 02:01:16.465
[SPEAKER_03]: And my hand for not being able to not hurt.

02:01:17.306 --> 02:01:18.646
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm about to go take some Vicodin.

02:01:20.727 --> 02:01:24.449
[SPEAKER_11]: My F you of the week goes to the fact that my weekend is almost over.

02:01:24.489 --> 02:01:29.491
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I actually had a pretty awesome weekend between, you know, Showgirls and other stuff.

02:01:30.031 --> 02:01:31.152
[SPEAKER_11]: Just, you know, I'm sad.

02:01:31.692 --> 02:01:32.152
[SPEAKER_11]: But whatever.

02:01:33.153 --> 02:01:33.653
[SPEAKER_11]: Life sucks.

02:01:35.600 --> 02:01:36.581
[SPEAKER_11]: Life sucks, you know?

02:01:36.942 --> 02:01:37.583
[SPEAKER_11]: Shit happens.

02:01:37.703 --> 02:01:37.943
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

02:01:39.004 --> 02:01:40.706
[SPEAKER_11]: Misty, do you have FUs of the week?

02:01:41.908 --> 02:01:42.369
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of.

02:01:43.410 --> 02:01:47.074
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just mostly to work drama and bullshit.

02:01:47.115 --> 02:01:48.737
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not even going to name specific names.

02:01:51.580 --> 02:01:54.484
[SPEAKER_04]: Also to the fact that I have not won the lottery, so I can't move out here yet.

02:01:55.922 --> 02:01:57.463
[SPEAKER_11]: FU to not winning the lottery, I can sign up for that.

02:01:57.483 --> 02:01:57.903
[SPEAKER_11]: No doubt.

02:01:58.503 --> 02:02:00.084
[SPEAKER_11]: Dan, the man, do you have some FUs?

02:02:00.424 --> 02:02:02.164
[SPEAKER_01]: I gotta throw an FU out to the economy.

02:02:03.165 --> 02:02:04.745
[SPEAKER_01]: Believe it or not, I miss having a job.

02:02:05.946 --> 02:02:09.987
[SPEAKER_01]: Having a job was actually a great way to break up your day.

02:02:13.548 --> 02:02:16.169
[SPEAKER_01]: And besides that, no, not too many.

02:02:17.530 --> 02:02:18.610
[SPEAKER_01]: FU to all who oppose me.

02:02:19.630 --> 02:02:20.191
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck you!

02:02:21.471 --> 02:02:22.872
[SPEAKER_01]: I will fucking kill you!

02:02:23.552 --> 02:02:24.012
[SPEAKER_04]: Back at ya.

02:02:25.582 --> 02:02:26.923
[SPEAKER_01]: Misty, are you saying you oppose Dan?

02:02:26.943 --> 02:02:27.563
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't oppose me.

02:02:27.723 --> 02:02:28.123
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh-oh.

02:02:28.604 --> 02:02:29.844
[SPEAKER_01]: We might have a throwdown.

02:02:29.864 --> 02:02:30.945
[SPEAKER_01]: No, just racial sarcasm.

02:02:30.965 --> 02:02:34.887
[SPEAKER_01]: Trust me, between now and Friday, I can make your life a living heck.

02:02:35.607 --> 02:02:35.927
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

02:02:37.048 --> 02:02:37.788
[SPEAKER_04]: Not compared to work.

02:02:38.229 --> 02:02:42.010
[SPEAKER_11]: Before we get back into the gaming news, of which I have a story here, and then we're going to get to the Skype line.

02:02:42.030 --> 02:02:42.571
[SPEAKER_04]: That's amazing.

02:02:42.591 --> 02:02:42.911
[SPEAKER_11]: Soon.

02:02:43.471 --> 02:02:48.374
[SPEAKER_11]: Soon we will get to the Skype line, and then the callers call in, and it just all goes down from there.

02:02:48.794 --> 02:02:49.054
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

02:02:49.574 --> 02:02:50.075
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to ask...

02:02:51.155 --> 02:02:54.678
[SPEAKER_11]: Misty though, what do you have planned for your week while you're here?

02:02:54.738 --> 02:02:55.578
[SPEAKER_11]: What are you going to do?

02:02:56.119 --> 02:02:58.280
[SPEAKER_11]: What stuff do you have to see?

02:02:59.301 --> 02:03:06.366
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I know when I think tourism I think Sacramento I think we should go to the zoo

02:03:08.623 --> 02:03:09.263
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be nice.

02:03:10.144 --> 02:03:15.107
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, mainly obligatory, our vagal time, sunrise for Parapara.

02:03:15.547 --> 02:03:17.489
[SPEAKER_11]: Feed Jamie to a giraffe if you go to the zoo.

02:03:17.969 --> 02:03:19.070
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no, red pandas.

02:03:19.730 --> 02:03:20.531
[SPEAKER_04]: Now why would I do that?

02:03:20.811 --> 02:03:21.932
[SPEAKER_04]: Dan maybe, but not Jamie.

02:03:25.874 --> 02:03:27.135
[SPEAKER_11]: Dan will get eaten by a grue.

02:03:29.717 --> 02:03:31.198
[SPEAKER_03]: Since when do they keep grues at zoos?

02:03:31.258 --> 02:03:32.319
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you guys going to go to San Francisco?

02:03:34.932 --> 02:03:38.533
[SPEAKER_03]: If we get enough people to help me with gas and parking... I think you guys will have fun.

02:03:38.973 --> 02:03:43.594
[SPEAKER_11]: Because, like Dan said, we're pretty broke, but... I don't know why your mic sucks, but... How about this?

02:03:43.854 --> 02:03:44.395
[SPEAKER_03]: Much better, yes.

02:03:44.715 --> 02:03:54.257
[SPEAKER_03]: If I have assistance with parking and everything and we eat cheap, and I don't completely blow my budget at Daiso, or IchibanCon, then...

02:03:55.902 --> 02:03:56.122
[SPEAKER_11]: Naya

02:04:18.806 --> 02:04:20.228
[SPEAKER_03]: The Gelato Place.

02:04:20.768 --> 02:04:21.850
[SPEAKER_03]: You can go to Naya and Berkeley.

02:04:21.870 --> 02:04:22.731
[SPEAKER_11]: You should go to Hot Cookie.

02:04:23.151 --> 02:04:23.932
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what Hot Cookie is?

02:04:23.992 --> 02:04:24.693
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the cookie store.

02:04:24.733 --> 02:04:25.975
[SPEAKER_11]: They sell cookies and underwear.

02:04:27.316 --> 02:04:28.778
[SPEAKER_11]: They sell cookies and panties.

02:04:28.838 --> 02:04:29.779
[SPEAKER_11]: That's really it.

02:04:30.260 --> 02:04:31.441
[SPEAKER_04]: Can't we just hit Yog-Yog?

02:04:32.783 --> 02:04:35.226
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, Yog-Yog is right around the corner from my house.

02:04:35.826 --> 02:04:36.267
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

02:04:36.547 --> 02:04:37.869
[SPEAKER_11]: I wish I could go with you gals, but...

02:04:38.999 --> 02:04:40.660
[SPEAKER_11]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

02:05:01.391 --> 02:05:23.412
[SPEAKER_11]: got bought this week and they sent out a release to their 17 million users saying quote X-Fire was bought by new owners today most of the team that has built X-Fire over the last six years is leaving we enjoyed working for you over the last 127 releases and wish we could stay to create the next 127 good luck and I'm sorry goodbye good luck and game on that's kind of uh

02:05:24.073 --> 02:05:26.896
[SPEAKER_11]: Tyton Gaming Skill Based Gaming Technology Money Competitive Gaming

02:05:41.892 --> 02:05:44.635
[SPEAKER_11]: Titan will be taking on the X-Fire name.

02:05:44.935 --> 02:05:48.399
[SPEAKER_11]: They're going to focus on ongoing innovation in the gaming space.

02:05:48.459 --> 02:05:51.883
[SPEAKER_11]: At least that's what the message says on their Titan website.

02:05:52.404 --> 02:05:53.245
[SPEAKER_11]: Quote, Interesting.

02:06:03.977 --> 02:06:10.583
[SPEAKER_11]: They're saying that this might be to try and position Titan Gaming to compete better with things like Virgin Gaming and so forth.

02:06:10.663 --> 02:06:16.748
[SPEAKER_11]: But I believe the sound you're going to hear right now is millions of users canceling their X-Fire accounts that they haven't already.

02:06:16.788 --> 02:06:17.429
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to be honest.

02:06:18.029 --> 02:06:20.291
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't used X-Fire since Steam came out.

02:06:20.751 --> 02:06:21.872
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, X-Fire?

02:06:22.213 --> 02:06:22.553
[SPEAKER_11]: Really?

02:06:22.573 --> 02:06:23.173
[SPEAKER_11]: I know.

02:06:23.754 --> 02:06:24.354
[SPEAKER_11]: They got bought?

02:06:24.414 --> 02:06:24.955
[SPEAKER_11]: Imagine that.

02:06:24.975 --> 02:06:27.217
[SPEAKER_11]: There it goes.

02:06:28.282 --> 02:06:34.567
[SPEAKER_11]: TigerClaw says if you go to Xfire.com you can watch a bunch of live streams of people playing on it and it's mostly wow.

02:06:34.707 --> 02:06:34.947
[SPEAKER_11]: Really?

02:06:36.108 --> 02:06:37.669
[SPEAKER_11]: Man, that's just what I want to see.

02:06:37.769 --> 02:06:42.333
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, let's go to Xfire.com right now and watch some a-holes play some wow.

[SPEAKER_11]: Live radio.

[SPEAKER_11]: I love this.

02:06:46.616 --> 02:06:47.216
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, you know what?

02:06:47.236 --> 02:06:51.139
[SPEAKER_11]: We need some theme music as we go to Xfire.com that was recently purchased by Titan.

02:06:51.459 --> 02:06:52.020
[SPEAKER_11]: Benny Hill.

02:06:57.029 --> 02:06:58.510
[SPEAKER_04]: That song works for practically everything.

02:06:58.550 --> 02:06:59.111
[SPEAKER_11]: Videos.

[SPEAKER_11]: Worst Rogue Priest in USA.

02:07:07.838 --> 02:07:09.039
[SPEAKER_11]: That doesn't even make sense.

02:07:09.639 --> 02:07:10.360
[SPEAKER_11]: How does that work?

02:07:10.760 --> 02:07:12.121
[SPEAKER_11]: There's some people doing arenas.

02:07:12.161 --> 02:07:14.723
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a heroic... Yeah, these are like all wow videos.

02:07:16.205 --> 02:07:16.465
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

02:07:16.505 --> 02:07:16.885
[SPEAKER_11]: You want to look?

02:07:16.925 --> 02:07:17.225
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see.

02:07:17.265 --> 02:07:19.627
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to see Worst Rogue Priest in the USA.

02:07:22.369 --> 02:07:22.830
[SPEAKER_11]: Where is it?

02:07:24.411 --> 02:07:24.972
[SPEAKER_11]: I clicked on it.

02:07:25.032 --> 02:07:25.512
[SPEAKER_11]: Nothing happened.

02:07:28.197 --> 02:07:29.897
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the worst segment ever.

02:07:29.957 --> 02:07:31.598
[SPEAKER_11]: Rob is fail at the internet.

02:07:31.618 --> 02:07:32.158
[SPEAKER_11]: Clearly.

02:07:32.438 --> 02:07:34.519
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, because I clicked on the wrong link.

02:07:34.539 --> 02:07:35.519
[SPEAKER_11]: This website sucks.

02:07:36.099 --> 02:07:38.140
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, let's X-Fire live video.

02:07:38.340 --> 02:07:39.560
[SPEAKER_04]: So now you're blaming the website.

02:07:39.720 --> 02:07:41.100
[SPEAKER_11]: Shh, shh, shh.

02:07:41.300 --> 02:07:42.401
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to snoop in, you guys.

02:07:42.961 --> 02:07:43.721
[SPEAKER_00]: Cyclone.

02:07:48.422 --> 02:07:49.163
[SPEAKER_00]: Cyclone.

02:07:51.163 --> 02:07:51.543
[SPEAKER_00]: Roots.

02:07:51.883 --> 02:07:53.184
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm casting Cyclone.

02:07:53.624 --> 02:07:54.544
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm casting Roots.

02:07:57.688 --> 02:08:04.330
[SPEAKER_11]: I got blind and... I'm getting drunk!

02:08:04.390 --> 02:08:09.111
[SPEAKER_11]: I fucking just fell asleep right there in that little... I mean, how much did they sell this website for?

02:08:09.151 --> 02:08:09.811
[SPEAKER_11]: 40 bucks?

02:08:09.831 --> 02:08:11.171
[SPEAKER_11]: Because that's about what it's worth.

02:08:12.092 --> 02:08:13.232
[SPEAKER_11]: It's 20 more than I would have paid.

02:08:15.012 --> 02:08:19.733
[SPEAKER_11]: Although I've got to say, couldn't we just do our show on X-Fire?

02:08:20.854 --> 02:08:21.534
[SPEAKER_01]: Not anymore.

02:08:23.106 --> 02:08:28.970
[SPEAKER_11]: We could go on there and do a live WoW stream and be all like, Hi, you're listening to Orange Dawn Radio.

02:08:29.310 --> 02:08:30.191
[SPEAKER_11]: Cyclone.

02:08:30.551 --> 02:08:31.972
[SPEAKER_11]: Cyclone.

02:08:31.992 --> 02:08:32.092
[SPEAKER_11]: Roots.

02:08:32.793 --> 02:08:33.933
[SPEAKER_11]: Cyclone.

02:08:34.094 --> 02:08:35.675
[SPEAKER_11]: And Cyclone.

02:08:36.595 --> 02:08:37.716
[SPEAKER_01]: Magic missile.

02:08:37.736 --> 02:08:39.938
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to use intimidating shout.

02:08:41.699 --> 02:08:43.160
[SPEAKER_11]: That really is a WoW move, actually.

02:08:43.260 --> 02:08:44.201
[SPEAKER_11]: I know.

02:08:46.442 --> 02:08:48.764
[SPEAKER_03]: Dan only knows that from watching South Park.

02:08:49.864 --> 02:08:50.205
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

02:08:51.030 --> 02:08:54.374
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, see, I didn't work in a video game store for 10 years or nothing.

02:08:55.055 --> 02:08:57.158
[SPEAKER_01]: People might talk about Warcraft there.

02:08:57.218 --> 02:09:00.422
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I banned my assistant manager from talking about Warcraft.

02:09:02.458 --> 02:09:02.838
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura

02:09:30.805 --> 02:09:32.887
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Treasure, actually.

02:09:34.528 --> 02:09:37.250
[SPEAKER_03]: They are wanting to work on another 3D shooting game.

02:09:37.951 --> 02:09:44.075
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you have really good programming skills and live in Japan, you actually might be able to make it.

02:09:44.536 --> 02:09:49.339
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a job listing on their website looking for a new project 3D action shooting game.

02:09:50.520 --> 02:09:54.003
[SPEAKER_03]: And they are advertising.

02:09:54.043 --> 02:09:55.864
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, we should send this actually to Krista.

02:09:57.585 --> 02:09:58.586
[SPEAKER_03]: Have her work for Treasure.

02:10:00.067 --> 02:10:01.549
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm surprised you're not applying for this.

02:10:01.609 --> 02:10:03.150
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't program shit.

02:10:03.951 --> 02:10:04.892
[SPEAKER_11]: You can learn fast.

02:10:04.912 --> 02:10:06.593
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to link this to Krista.

02:10:06.894 --> 02:10:10.497
[SPEAKER_11]: You could lie about your qualifications like in Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead.

02:10:11.057 --> 02:10:11.698
[SPEAKER_03]: That was great.

02:10:12.379 --> 02:10:13.880
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I see you graduated from Vassar.

02:10:15.161 --> 02:10:16.222
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm right on top of it, Rose.

02:10:17.543 --> 02:10:19.225
[SPEAKER_03]: You know I saw that in the theater.

02:10:19.285 --> 02:10:19.665
[SPEAKER_01]: Me too.

02:10:19.945 --> 02:10:21.026
[SPEAKER_01]: The dishes are done, man.

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:24.724
[SPEAKER_11]: Why are we quoting a movie that's like 20 years old?

02:10:24.804 --> 02:10:26.566
[SPEAKER_11]: Because movies, like, are awesome.

02:10:27.848 --> 02:10:30.972
[SPEAKER_11]: We have some listeners that weren't even born yet when that movie came out.

02:10:31.313 --> 02:10:31.793
[SPEAKER_11]: Fuck them.

02:10:32.014 --> 02:10:34.096
[SPEAKER_11]: It's on DVD.

02:10:35.731 --> 02:10:36.091
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe?

02:10:37.732 --> 02:10:39.832
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they've put worse shit on DVD from what I hear.

02:10:40.332 --> 02:10:41.913
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't specifically know what, but yeah.

02:10:42.273 --> 02:10:42.593
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

02:10:43.193 --> 02:10:44.414
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's talk StarCraft 2.

02:10:44.474 --> 02:10:45.614
[SPEAKER_11]: And how.

02:10:45.794 --> 02:10:46.074
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

02:10:46.174 --> 02:10:52.937
[SPEAKER_11]: And Dan, you better be careful because, you know, this house is prone to getting these spy bots and these bad things in it.

02:10:53.437 --> 02:10:55.737
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is important to know about StarCraft 2.

02:10:55.857 --> 02:11:00.319
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, this is actually halfway serious because there are a lot of phishing scams out there.

02:11:00.339 --> 02:11:03.120
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm not talking about, like, phishing, like, you know,

02:11:03.840 --> 02:11:04.401
[SPEAKER_11]: Reel her in.

02:11:04.681 --> 02:11:06.442
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm talking fishing like P.H.

02:11:06.642 --> 02:11:07.002
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow.

02:11:07.282 --> 02:11:08.864
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not like talking Dreamcast fishing.

02:11:08.984 --> 02:11:12.826
[SPEAKER_11]: The great thing is he's looking right at me when he's saying that like I'm not going to understand.

02:11:12.846 --> 02:11:14.227
[SPEAKER_11]: You need to understand.

02:11:14.327 --> 02:11:15.428
[SPEAKER_11]: No, Dan.

02:11:15.448 --> 02:11:19.071
[SPEAKER_01]: Why aren't you looking at DarkSakura over there?

02:11:20.151 --> 02:11:29.138
[SPEAKER_01]: Miss Spybot search and destroy herself who's downloaded 15 viruses in the time that we've watched the show and managed to kill them all.

02:11:31.749 --> 02:11:33.311
[SPEAKER_11]: and then she's looking at me like she's hurt.

02:11:34.051 --> 02:11:39.156
[SPEAKER_11]: She dumped like a gallon of bleach hypothetically into her computer to clean up any possible viruses.

02:11:39.316 --> 02:11:42.279
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and you want to know exactly how I got rid of it actually?

02:11:42.780 --> 02:11:46.163
[SPEAKER_03]: I finally ended up doing a Windows search finding the DLLs and deleting them.

02:11:47.044 --> 02:11:48.105
[SPEAKER_11]: And what was the DLL called?

02:11:48.942 --> 02:11:49.643
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck if I can remember.

02:11:49.683 --> 02:11:52.124
[SPEAKER_03]: There's also a few EXCs attached to it, but I got rid of them.

02:11:52.144 --> 02:11:53.325
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was called STD.

02:11:54.186 --> 02:11:57.308
[SPEAKER_03]: No, the STD one was one that was among the list of those.

02:11:57.688 --> 02:12:01.411
[SPEAKER_03]: But the things that I have are from like last year, all the instructions.

02:12:01.891 --> 02:12:03.112
[SPEAKER_03]: And the program has changed since.

02:12:03.432 --> 02:12:04.513
[SPEAKER_03]: So they've renamed all the stuff.

02:12:04.533 --> 02:12:05.974
[SPEAKER_03]: So I had to go back and refine them.

02:12:06.555 --> 02:12:08.536
[SPEAKER_03]: But I took care of it.

02:12:08.996 --> 02:12:10.878
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like a Pokemon, but STD.

02:12:10.898 --> 02:12:12.339
[SPEAKER_11]: Isn't that the oil that you put in your car?

02:12:12.359 --> 02:12:12.919
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was also actually...

02:12:19.464 --> 02:12:24.928
[SPEAKER_03]: Every time I would stop the process, it would restart the process through a different database builder that I had built in.

02:12:24.948 --> 02:12:28.270
[SPEAKER_03]: So I actually had to delete the database builder and the program.

02:12:29.411 --> 02:12:30.151
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's gone.

02:12:31.512 --> 02:12:32.993
[SPEAKER_11]: Did your computer become self-aware?

02:12:34.894 --> 02:12:35.835
[SPEAKER_03]: It touches itself, Rob.

02:12:36.590 --> 02:12:39.152
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, can I move on talking about StarCraft 2?

02:12:39.232 --> 02:12:40.432
[SPEAKER_03]: It sure is aware of itself.

02:12:40.693 --> 02:12:41.233
[SPEAKER_04]: If you must.

02:12:41.373 --> 02:12:47.096
[SPEAKER_11]: Be wary because there are a lot of phishing emails going out there about certain StarCraft 2 promotions.

02:12:47.196 --> 02:12:57.863
[SPEAKER_11]: For example, if there's an email that you get about new free maps or a new mount for Warcraft, I guess this kind of crosses over, or any type of extra StarCraft 2 stuff.

02:12:58.543 --> 02:13:05.370
[SPEAKER_11]: They're trying to get your battle.net account info to try and get your activation key for the game.

02:13:05.450 --> 02:13:06.391
[SPEAKER_11]: So be careful.

02:13:06.431 --> 02:13:07.973
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a lot of phishing emails out there.

02:13:08.773 --> 02:13:11.396
[SPEAKER_11]: Obviously, it's been going on in World of Warcraft 4 forever.

02:13:11.736 --> 02:13:20.084
[SPEAKER_11]: Unfortunately, Blizzard hasn't really been able to fight it outside of the authenticator, which is a little silly that they've had to release this authenticator to protect accounts.

02:13:20.144 --> 02:13:20.385
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean...

02:13:20.825 --> 02:13:23.066
[SPEAKER_11]: But unfortunately, they're just so prone to getting hacked.

02:13:23.106 --> 02:13:24.326
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, my own account was hacked.

02:13:24.627 --> 02:13:28.608
[SPEAKER_11]: I mentioned earlier in the show, you know, last year and it sucked.

02:13:28.728 --> 02:13:30.769
[SPEAKER_11]: It was it was kind of like virtual rape.

02:13:31.049 --> 02:13:36.711
[SPEAKER_11]: Like it was just my character was like somebody played my character played with my character when I didn't know.

02:13:37.211 --> 02:13:38.432
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just very sad.

02:13:38.703 --> 02:13:39.284
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:13:52.835 --> 02:13:54.056
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of times they do that too.

02:13:54.116 --> 02:14:00.640
[SPEAKER_11]: In fact, there actually is a big login message in World of Warcraft now that says don't use the same password for Warcraft that you do any other website.

02:14:00.921 --> 02:14:03.683
[SPEAKER_11]: Because if they get your password for Warcraft, they'll get your other passwords too.

02:14:07.025 --> 02:14:07.625
[SPEAKER_11]: Why is that funny?

02:14:07.845 --> 02:14:20.294
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I could just see some guy putting in his password, which is undoubtedly password, for his bank account and his World of Warcraft and his, you know, everything.

02:14:21.254 --> 02:14:21.895
[SPEAKER_01]: And then being like,

02:14:22.816 --> 02:14:24.498
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my god, I lost all my money.

02:14:24.959 --> 02:14:28.944
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, but the real tragedy is they cleaned out my Warcraft character.

02:14:29.645 --> 02:14:30.747
[SPEAKER_01]: You deserve it.

02:14:32.774 --> 02:15:00.562
[SPEAKER_11]: nobody deserves to have their Warcraft character raped I'm sorry Rob I know that hit a little too close there may be a few people Monty Boggs in our chatroom says did he touch your character in the swimsuit area and I play a tauren for heaven's sakes yes he did touch the tauren in the swimsuit area that's how desperate these people are Frisbee in our chatroom says password 12345 to which Bonds006 says damn it now I have to go change my password

02:15:00.981 --> 02:15:02.662
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the same password I have on my luggage.

02:15:05.565 --> 02:15:13.911
[SPEAKER_01]: The great thing is I read somewhere in this last week that they're cracking down on people who are having relations in World of Warcraft now.

02:15:14.131 --> 02:15:15.953
[SPEAKER_11]: Why can't they go after these companies?

02:15:15.993 --> 02:15:20.436
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, I realize they're in another country or whatever, but isn't Blizzard established in a lot of these other countries?

02:15:20.476 --> 02:15:22.138
[SPEAKER_11]: Why don't they go after these guys legally?

02:15:22.438 --> 02:15:23.779
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it's a bad thing that they're doing.

02:15:24.195 --> 02:15:25.817
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, wait, wait, wait, wait.

02:15:25.917 --> 02:15:27.980
[SPEAKER_03]: They have roleplay servers for a reason.

02:15:28.701 --> 02:15:30.143
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, apparently they don't care.

02:15:31.024 --> 02:15:35.210
[SPEAKER_01]: Because some 10-year-old went wandering on one of those roleplay servers, I guess.

02:15:35.230 --> 02:15:39.035
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, in a completely unrelated type of story, although I think that's what you're referring to.

02:15:39.695 --> 02:15:46.499
[SPEAKER_11]: Blizzard actually announced this week, kind of unofficially on the forums, they were going to patrol one of the servers a little more because of the roleplay.

02:15:46.699 --> 02:15:55.083
[SPEAKER_11]: This server's kind of known for being the adult roleplay server, and people like to roleplay in the tavern in Goldshire.

02:15:55.123 --> 02:15:55.984
[SPEAKER_11]: Right, that's what I read.

02:15:56.104 --> 02:15:57.445
[SPEAKER_11]: And I can't remember the name of the server.

02:15:57.485 --> 02:15:59.606
[SPEAKER_03]: You're in the tavern getting drunk!

02:16:01.022 --> 02:16:04.565
[SPEAKER_11]: If there's any girls there, I want to do them!

02:16:05.265 --> 02:16:10.649
[SPEAKER_11]: But what's amazing about RP servers is that there's just as many griefers as there are actual RPers.

02:16:10.949 --> 02:16:13.491
[SPEAKER_11]: So you can just imagine what these servers look like some days.

02:16:14.151 --> 02:16:16.112
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, that almost makes me want to play Warcraft.

02:16:16.953 --> 02:16:18.114
[SPEAKER_11]: You just want to be a griefer.

02:16:18.434 --> 02:16:18.914
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yes.

02:16:19.255 --> 02:16:21.116
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, no, you want to do adult RP.

02:16:21.396 --> 02:16:21.977
[SPEAKER_01]: Admit it, Dan.

02:16:22.077 --> 02:16:23.418
[SPEAKER_01]: I could do adult RP at home.

02:16:24.738 --> 02:16:25.319
[SPEAKER_01]: Trust me.

02:16:25.359 --> 02:16:26.319
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, really now?

02:16:26.359 --> 02:16:27.280
[SPEAKER_01]: Being an adult sucks.

02:16:27.300 --> 02:16:28.600
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd rather do 10-year-old RP.

02:16:28.620 --> 02:16:30.381
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd be like, why is your character sitting there on the ground?

02:16:30.441 --> 02:16:31.041
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm playing with G.I.

02:16:31.222 --> 02:16:31.762
[SPEAKER_01]: Joe's.

02:16:32.262 --> 02:16:33.443
[SPEAKER_03]: It's amazing.

02:16:34.023 --> 02:16:35.104
[SPEAKER_03]: Lance of Longinus.

02:16:36.584 --> 02:16:42.387
[SPEAKER_11]: If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

02:16:42.507 --> 02:16:45.249
[SPEAKER_11]: The Skype line is open.

02:16:45.269 --> 02:16:47.810
[SPEAKER_11]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.

02:16:47.890 --> 02:16:49.411
[SPEAKER_03]: Call and harass Dan for me.

02:16:50.611 --> 02:16:51.372
[SPEAKER_11]: Game Oler.

02:16:52.012 --> 02:16:53.753
[SPEAKER_11]: We should have a segment called Make Dan Laugh.

02:16:56.167 --> 02:16:56.427
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

02:16:57.547 --> 02:16:58.348
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not that hard.

02:16:59.288 --> 02:16:59.648
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.

02:16:59.748 --> 02:17:01.108
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm known as Chuckles.

02:17:01.188 --> 02:17:04.069
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, SalaciousPop in our chat is following up with the details of the story there.

02:17:04.309 --> 02:17:07.750
[SPEAKER_11]: There's one particular roleplay server that has been earmarked for erotic chat.

02:17:07.810 --> 02:17:09.250
[SPEAKER_11]: Apparently it gets pretty explicit.

02:17:09.290 --> 02:17:10.070
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, I want to play there.

02:17:10.270 --> 02:17:11.351
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the word erotic.

02:17:11.691 --> 02:17:14.411
[SPEAKER_11]: All level 5 toons in the human side start are in.

02:17:15.332 --> 02:17:21.093
[SPEAKER_11]: TigerClaw says, speaking of StarCraft, you have the story about Blizzard removing StarCraft 2 maps due to inappropriate content, right?

02:17:21.473 --> 02:17:22.393
[SPEAKER_11]: I did hear about that.

02:17:22.513 --> 02:17:25.414
[SPEAKER_11]: All the wang maps and penis looking maps and you know.

02:17:25.994 --> 02:17:30.544
[SPEAKER_01]: Quit making maps that look suggestive Attack your balls Alright

02:17:35.464 --> 02:17:38.405
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to defend your zone.

02:17:39.205 --> 02:17:39.966
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's be honest.

02:17:40.066 --> 02:17:43.227
[SPEAKER_01]: If the Zerg attack your groin, your day is ruined.

02:17:43.267 --> 02:17:50.389
[SPEAKER_11]: StarCraft 2 apparently has these crazy ass modes where you can make RP games.

02:17:50.930 --> 02:17:53.451
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, erotic roleplay in StarCraft.

02:17:53.891 --> 02:17:54.491
[SPEAKER_11]: Coming soon.

02:17:54.611 --> 02:17:55.191
[SPEAKER_11]: Jesus.

02:17:56.272 --> 02:17:57.052
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, my child.

02:17:57.092 --> 02:17:58.592
[SPEAKER_01]: Your soldiers are all really tiny.

02:17:59.633 --> 02:18:00.173
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's go to the phones.

02:18:00.193 --> 02:18:01.313
[SPEAKER_11]: I just don't see how that would be exciting.

02:18:01.393 --> 02:18:02.474
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, you're on Orange Silence Radio.

02:18:02.494 --> 02:18:02.834
[SPEAKER_11]: Who's this?

02:18:04.975 --> 02:18:05.395
[SPEAKER_11]: Yo.

02:18:06.176 --> 02:18:06.596
[SPEAKER_11]: Yo.

02:18:06.837 --> 02:18:07.537
[SPEAKER_08]: Yo.

02:18:08.398 --> 02:18:08.778
[SPEAKER_11]: What up?

02:18:08.798 --> 02:18:09.779
[SPEAKER_13]: Hello there, OLR.

02:18:09.799 --> 02:18:13.823
[SPEAKER_13]: Speaking of which, speaking of a Swede, this is that one Swede.

02:18:15.184 --> 02:18:18.206
[SPEAKER_11]: It's our crazy Swede, Akin Ripper is calling in.

02:18:18.246 --> 02:18:19.227
[SPEAKER_11]: Jesus heck is this?

02:18:20.708 --> 02:18:21.469
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut up, Dan.

02:18:21.489 --> 02:18:23.010
[SPEAKER_11]: He's one of our official Swedes.

02:18:23.030 --> 02:18:25.452
[SPEAKER_11]: Dan, we have listeners all over the world.

02:18:25.552 --> 02:18:26.533
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, this is real.

02:18:26.833 --> 02:18:26.974
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

02:18:29.174 --> 02:18:30.975
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought that guy was just putting on a voice.

02:18:31.075 --> 02:18:33.436
[SPEAKER_11]: No, he's really, well, at least as far as we know, he's really Swedish.

02:18:33.476 --> 02:18:34.656
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty impressed now, actually.

02:18:34.816 --> 02:18:37.237
[SPEAKER_13]: No, no, no, no, Dan, I am from Sweden.

02:18:37.477 --> 02:18:39.357
[SPEAKER_13]: Can we show an Apple film?

02:18:39.837 --> 02:18:44.099
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, well, that's a really bad example, but well.

02:18:44.539 --> 02:18:46.359
[SPEAKER_11]: He just went off on you in Swedish.

02:18:46.479 --> 02:18:47.459
[SPEAKER_11]: How is the chef?

02:18:47.600 --> 02:18:47.980
[SPEAKER_04]: That was hot.

02:18:49.800 --> 02:18:51.282
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a question about Sweden.

02:18:51.342 --> 02:18:52.022
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know.

02:18:53.163 --> 02:18:54.044
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to know this.

02:18:54.204 --> 02:18:58.889
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so in Sweden, do you guys call Swedish fish just fish?

02:19:00.490 --> 02:19:01.911
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we don't.

02:19:01.931 --> 02:19:03.873
[SPEAKER_01]: They're delicious and they're rad.

02:19:03.953 --> 02:19:04.754
[SPEAKER_13]: We don't fish.

02:19:06.541 --> 02:19:09.743
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, some of us do, but it's like dying out of sorts.

02:19:09.763 --> 02:19:10.544
[SPEAKER_01]: He said some of us do.

02:19:10.704 --> 02:19:11.184
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

02:19:11.925 --> 02:19:14.046
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad that you confirmed that for me.

02:19:14.586 --> 02:19:27.876
[SPEAKER_13]: But on the subject of fish, though, yes, I will, because I live in that part of Sweden where, you know, the thing where rotten fish is supposedly popular.

02:19:28.176 --> 02:19:30.058
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, wait, but it isn't rotten.

02:19:30.158 --> 02:19:33.160
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just like fermented beyond fermented.

02:19:33.900 --> 02:19:34.221
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

02:19:34.521 --> 02:19:34.641
[SPEAKER_13]: And...

02:19:35.712 --> 02:19:38.754
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, so-called Sooster means it.

02:19:38.774 --> 02:19:41.195
[SPEAKER_13]: So do you guys like eat them or do you just smell them?

02:19:41.235 --> 02:19:42.195
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm taking one of those.

02:19:44.777 --> 02:19:46.958
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, what did you call in for tonight?

02:19:46.978 --> 02:19:47.538
[SPEAKER_11]: What's the point?

02:19:48.279 --> 02:19:49.799
[SPEAKER_11]: Dan, stop egging him on.

02:19:49.900 --> 02:19:52.981
[SPEAKER_11]: Dan, Aki Ripper, what did you call in to talk about tonight?

02:19:53.001 --> 02:19:56.383
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what I said.

02:19:56.443 --> 02:20:03.987
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, Blizzard still won't accept won't let me play StarCraft 2, but oh well,

02:20:04.914 --> 02:20:06.174
[SPEAKER_13]: But here's the thing, though.

02:20:06.234 --> 02:20:13.996
[SPEAKER_13]: I haven't, like, I've tried to call their customer service for, well, what, two times?

02:20:14.136 --> 02:20:15.236
[SPEAKER_13]: And it was all busy.

02:20:15.316 --> 02:20:18.337
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm like, yeah, screw this.

02:20:18.577 --> 02:20:20.917
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to start playing Sims 3.

02:20:21.257 --> 02:20:23.178
[SPEAKER_13]: Can you play StarCraft 1?

02:20:23.358 --> 02:20:27.438
[SPEAKER_13]: And speaking of Sims 3, there has been, like, a few...

02:20:32.090 --> 02:20:43.248
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, in a recent tweet thing about the coming expansion since late night, or what is it now?

02:20:43.869 --> 02:20:44.049
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

02:20:44.662 --> 02:20:48.464
[SPEAKER_13]: Sims 3 Late Night, the latest expansion or whatever.

02:20:48.885 --> 02:20:51.086
[SPEAKER_11]: Is this with erotic roleplay as well?

02:20:51.806 --> 02:20:52.647
[SPEAKER_11]: Sims Late Night?

02:20:52.687 --> 02:20:53.688
[SPEAKER_11]: Sounds kind of kinky.

02:20:53.708 --> 02:20:55.369
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't that why they killed Sims Online?

02:20:55.409 --> 02:20:59.671
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, Sims Online turned into just, it was so sinful.

02:20:59.831 --> 02:21:00.612
[SPEAKER_11]: What was going on?

02:21:00.852 --> 02:21:01.392
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly.

02:21:01.412 --> 02:21:02.073
[SPEAKER_11]: Sims Online.

02:21:02.133 --> 02:21:04.174
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what the Sims always turns into.

02:21:04.454 --> 02:21:05.835
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone who plays the Sims is a pervo.

02:21:09.097 --> 02:21:10.558
[SPEAKER_03]: Dan, shut up.

02:21:11.078 --> 02:21:11.478
[SPEAKER_03]: I play Sims.

02:21:11.498 --> 02:21:11.879
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on, hold on.

02:21:11.979 --> 02:21:12.419
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't remember.

02:21:12.439 --> 02:21:12.979
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't remember.

02:21:13.199 --> 02:21:17.021
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to rewind a little bit because you're still mad at Blizzard and rightfully so.

02:21:17.301 --> 02:21:20.383
[SPEAKER_11]: But I have some ideas for you on how to take your revenge on Blizzard.

02:21:20.723 --> 02:21:26.646
[SPEAKER_11]: And one of them you just brought up, this stanky rotten fish thing, you need to send Blizzard a can of that.

02:21:28.367 --> 02:21:30.448
[SPEAKER_01]: So is it like you can't play any Blizzard games?

02:21:30.488 --> 02:21:32.228
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you play StarCraft 1, for example?

02:21:32.248 --> 02:21:33.969
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think it will help in any kind of way.

02:21:33.989 --> 02:21:34.169
[SPEAKER_13]: And well...

02:21:36.471 --> 02:21:52.409
[SPEAKER_13]: One kind of thing that pisses me a bit off is that while I have apparently some way on getting that authenticator, my current cell phone that I use don't support the authenticator, unfortunately.

02:21:53.450 --> 02:21:55.212
[SPEAKER_13]: Can you get the little physical one?

02:21:55.232 --> 02:21:55.833
[SPEAKER_13]: Which sucks.

02:21:56.448 --> 02:21:57.509
[SPEAKER_01]: What time is it in Sweden?

02:21:58.149 --> 02:22:03.593
[SPEAKER_13]: You talked about the Blizzard Authenticator.

02:22:03.653 --> 02:22:05.995
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, the actual one, not the mobile one.

02:22:06.335 --> 02:22:09.598
[SPEAKER_13]: Which is available to some cell phones.

02:22:10.154 --> 02:22:19.576
[SPEAKER_13]: My problem is that the current cell phone that I'm using at the moment, I can't use that because it's not a Symbian cell phone.

02:22:20.376 --> 02:22:21.657
[SPEAKER_11]: I can remember.

02:22:21.697 --> 02:22:25.397
[SPEAKER_11]: They sell a standalone one that's not just for cell phones.

02:22:25.697 --> 02:22:26.518
[SPEAKER_11]: You push a little button on it.

02:22:26.778 --> 02:22:29.298
[SPEAKER_11]: Alan has one, and I used to have one a couple years ago.

02:22:29.598 --> 02:22:30.759
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like a physical authenticator.

02:22:30.779 --> 02:22:31.999
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't need a mobile phone for it.

02:22:32.079 --> 02:22:36.320
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, which is good because I will most likely order that one instead of the...

02:22:37.270 --> 02:22:38.571
[SPEAKER_13]: instead of the one on the cell phone.

02:22:38.671 --> 02:22:40.492
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

02:22:40.812 --> 02:22:42.733
[SPEAKER_11]: Ike Ripper, we've got to let you go to get more calls.

02:22:42.833 --> 02:22:44.554
[SPEAKER_11]: Everybody was trying to get through to talk to Dan tonight.

02:22:44.854 --> 02:22:45.735
[SPEAKER_11]: But thank you very much.

02:22:46.535 --> 02:22:47.016
[SPEAKER_11]: Take care.

02:22:47.176 --> 02:22:48.416
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway, once again, for all.

02:22:49.784 --> 02:22:52.466
[SPEAKER_13]: Your show rocks!

02:22:53.067 --> 02:22:54.328
[SPEAKER_13]: I love you, AK Ripper.

02:22:54.368 --> 02:22:55.529
[SPEAKER_11]: By the way, one other suggestion.

02:22:55.549 --> 02:22:56.830
[SPEAKER_13]: Especially actually tonight.

02:22:57.330 --> 02:23:02.415
[SPEAKER_13]: Tonight since actually Dan and, well, Nifty and all those guests was quite fun.

02:23:02.615 --> 02:23:07.079
[SPEAKER_11]: If you want to make Blizzard really upset, threaten to take away IKEA.

02:23:10.221 --> 02:23:13.224
[SPEAKER_11]: Swedish people would.

02:23:13.504 --> 02:23:14.765
[SPEAKER_11]: AK Ripper, you take care, buddy.

02:23:15.145 --> 02:23:16.747
[SPEAKER_11]: Good luck with your Blizzard drama.

02:23:17.087 --> 02:23:17.407
[SPEAKER_13]: Later.

02:23:17.607 --> 02:23:17.868
[SPEAKER_11]: Bye.

02:23:18.608 --> 02:23:19.048
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, this is...

02:23:41.567 --> 02:23:47.473
[SPEAKER_11]: DJ Blazeken I'm doing fine and actually kind of excited about the 3DS but not as much as if

02:24:04.329 --> 02:24:08.553
[SPEAKER_12]: There were Beatmania or DJ Max coming to the PS3.

02:24:08.793 --> 02:24:09.454
[SPEAKER_11]: Wait, hold on.

02:24:09.634 --> 02:24:11.096
[SPEAKER_11]: I got a real quick question for you.

02:24:11.116 --> 02:24:11.756
[SPEAKER_11]: Where are you from?

02:24:13.798 --> 02:24:16.020
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm straight out of Omaha, Nebraska.

02:24:16.141 --> 02:24:17.021
[SPEAKER_12]: Stuck here in the...

02:24:18.497 --> 02:24:22.439
[SPEAKER_12]: Middle of the United States of America with the best music arcade in America.

02:24:22.459 --> 02:24:23.119
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, wait, hold on.

02:24:23.139 --> 02:24:24.120
[SPEAKER_11]: Hold that thought for a minute.

02:24:24.160 --> 02:24:26.161
[SPEAKER_11]: Dan, he's from Omaha, Nebraska.

02:24:26.181 --> 02:24:27.141
[SPEAKER_11]: That's not Sweden.

02:24:27.161 --> 02:24:27.982
[SPEAKER_11]: That's not Sweden.

02:24:28.002 --> 02:24:29.842
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even think they have Ikea in Nebraska.

02:24:29.862 --> 02:24:31.023
[SPEAKER_01]: Nebraska, almost worse.

02:24:31.163 --> 02:24:31.443
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

02:24:31.543 --> 02:24:32.003
[SPEAKER_01]: Shush.

02:24:32.284 --> 02:24:32.884
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost worse.

02:24:32.944 --> 02:24:34.545
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't been to Nebraska yet.

02:24:34.585 --> 02:24:37.926
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep in mind, I'm going to be smacking him like a red-headed stepchild later.

02:24:38.286 --> 02:24:38.566
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

02:24:38.767 --> 02:24:39.187
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I help?

02:24:39.487 --> 02:24:40.227
[SPEAKER_03]: The 3DS.

02:24:40.267 --> 02:24:44.089
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, you do know there is DJ Hero on the 3DS, but I don't know if you're a fan of that.

02:24:46.155 --> 02:24:46.915
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, do you know what?

02:24:47.035 --> 02:25:01.900
[SPEAKER_12]: I made a sketch about a few months ago while sitting in lunch at high school and trying to figure out, because I kind of rumored how Guitar Hero came to the DS, so I was kind of figuring out how the heck they're going to pull off DJ Hero on DS.

02:25:02.641 --> 02:25:15.665
[SPEAKER_12]: And my thing was the same thing that they did for Guitar Hero, but just put a miniature turntable into the GBA slot with the buttons on there and then have the crossfader

02:25:16.636 --> 02:25:17.597
[SPEAKER_12]: on the touch screen.

02:25:17.918 --> 02:25:19.219
[SPEAKER_12]: That was my idea.

02:25:35.800 --> 02:25:36.161
[SPEAKER_11]: Jesus.

02:25:36.181 --> 02:25:36.661
[SPEAKER_11]: Only balls?

02:25:36.681 --> 02:25:39.964
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, especially for steering, unless you're using the little analog nubs they got on there.

02:26:00.501 --> 02:26:02.123
[SPEAKER_12]: That's how I play on the PSP.

02:26:02.203 --> 02:26:06.327
[SPEAKER_12]: I cannot stand... Well, they have an analog nut on it.

02:26:06.887 --> 02:26:08.009
[SPEAKER_11]: The collision was so weird.

02:26:08.029 --> 02:26:11.732
[SPEAKER_11]: When you run into your wall, the car would rotate like 15 degrees at a time.

02:26:11.832 --> 02:26:13.114
[SPEAKER_11]: It wasn't very smooth.

02:26:13.694 --> 02:26:14.715
[SPEAKER_11]: It is rich, right, sir.

02:26:14.815 --> 02:26:15.016
[SPEAKER_11]: I know.

02:26:15.056 --> 02:26:15.456
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, wait.

02:26:15.676 --> 02:26:17.618
[SPEAKER_11]: Hold on, because this is the real question I wanted to ask.

02:26:17.638 --> 02:26:22.343
[SPEAKER_11]: DJ Blaziken said he was drawing this out while he was in high school, kind of like doodling, it sounds like.

02:26:22.363 --> 02:26:22.843
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

02:26:23.584 --> 02:26:24.064
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:26:42.307 --> 02:26:44.229
[SPEAKER_11]: and a vine and like, you know, things.

02:26:44.869 --> 02:26:46.371
[SPEAKER_11]: And you would like on another piece of paper.

02:26:46.391 --> 02:26:52.416
[SPEAKER_11]: It was basically a poor man's Dungeons and Dragons mixed with an 8-bit video game.

02:26:52.616 --> 02:26:57.120
[SPEAKER_01]: We made many, many poor graph paper.

02:26:57.260 --> 02:26:58.481
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, graph paper.

02:26:58.561 --> 02:27:00.623
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

02:27:00.703 --> 02:27:04.566
[SPEAKER_11]: And there would always be a woman with big boobies at the end of the maze that we were trying to get to.

02:27:04.586 --> 02:27:04.666
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

02:27:08.160 --> 02:27:10.301
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know why I decided to talk about that, but I did.

02:27:10.581 --> 02:27:13.382
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, I wanted to do a back in my day story.

02:27:13.582 --> 02:27:14.082
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, anyways.

02:27:15.503 --> 02:27:37.491
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, you know how the new DJ Max technical, which I haven't played yet, but I've been the only thing near to that we even have here in Omaha is DJ or not DJ Max Beatmania 13 Distorted is what we got over here, and I'll tell you this straight up, the

02:27:38.004 --> 02:27:40.185
[SPEAKER_12]: Family Fun Center is what it's called over here.

02:27:40.225 --> 02:27:43.887
[SPEAKER_12]: They've kept a majority of their music games up and running like perfect health.

02:27:44.827 --> 02:27:59.193
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, I've got to give a giant F you to my local mall's arcade because one of my favorite games down there, a music game in particular, In the Groove, which I play frequently when I go there while my mom's getting her nails done and whatnot.

02:28:00.534 --> 02:28:01.634
[SPEAKER_04]: That is one way to kill time.

02:28:01.654 --> 02:28:03.815
[SPEAKER_12]: Basically, it's down.

02:28:04.936 --> 02:28:05.036
[SPEAKER_12]: And

02:28:06.152 --> 02:28:08.656
[SPEAKER_12]: The game's been out of commission for more than a month.

02:28:11.582 --> 02:28:15.509
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you ever go to the nail salon and inhale the fumes in there before you go play in the groove?

02:28:17.042 --> 02:28:17.542
[SPEAKER_11]: BlackWolf

02:28:47.346 --> 02:28:49.747
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not the only one that has a vision problem.

02:28:49.887 --> 02:28:53.727
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm kind of also at the same point because I can only see well in one eye.

02:28:53.888 --> 02:28:57.708
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I can think of two listeners we have at least that have both eyes blind.

02:28:57.728 --> 02:29:01.529
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't In The Groove get sued out of existence?

02:29:02.750 --> 02:29:03.370
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it got sued.

02:29:03.410 --> 02:29:06.490
[SPEAKER_11]: It got annihilated by judgments, basically.

02:29:06.771 --> 02:29:08.551
[SPEAKER_11]: It was sued out of commission.

02:29:09.993 --> 02:29:10.834
[SPEAKER_11]: but that's a whole other show

02:29:38.740 --> 02:29:41.943
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to let you go, dude, because we've got to get more calls.

02:29:42.143 --> 02:29:44.665
[SPEAKER_12]: I've got one last question.

02:29:44.786 --> 02:29:45.206
[SPEAKER_12]: Make it quick.

02:29:46.027 --> 02:29:49.870
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you think there's a possibility of DJ Max Technica on the DS?

02:29:50.691 --> 02:29:51.592
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't hold my breath.

02:29:53.490 --> 02:29:54.691
[SPEAKER_11]: Anything is possible.

02:29:55.251 --> 02:29:58.233
[SPEAKER_11]: It's always about sales and how much those dev kits are going to cost.

02:29:58.393 --> 02:30:02.676
[SPEAKER_11]: I wouldn't expect it for at least a year because those dev kits are going to have to come down in price a little bit.

02:30:02.796 --> 02:30:04.097
[SPEAKER_11]: So don't get your hopes up for right away.

02:30:04.617 --> 02:30:06.999
[SPEAKER_11]: All you got for right now is DJ Hero.

02:30:07.039 --> 02:30:10.261
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you're lucky, somebody will come up with another innovative music game.

02:30:10.301 --> 02:30:16.706
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's not forget the DS is what gave us Elite Beat Agents, which basically is DJ Max Technica.

02:30:16.966 --> 02:30:18.187
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, right?

02:30:19.327 --> 02:30:21.669
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, again, I've never played Technica.

02:30:21.969 --> 02:30:37.333
[SPEAKER_11]: In the States and is now on sale with accessories for $9.99 Alright buddy, we're going to let you go to get more calls You take care, have a good one Alright, peace out, the show rocks, and bye Bye Okay, let's go to another call Hello, you're on Orange Lines Radio, who's this?

[SPEAKER_01]: She was for like a day.

[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's been on this but me.

[SPEAKER_11]: Dan, you are unemployed.

02:31:21.114 --> 02:31:22.576
[SPEAKER_11]: Now is the perfect time to play WoW.

02:31:22.696 --> 02:31:25.139
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly.

02:31:25.159 --> 02:31:26.501
[SPEAKER_11]: You're like the fourth person to do that.

02:31:26.801 --> 02:31:27.762
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.

02:31:27.842 --> 02:31:28.023

[SPEAKER_03]: Dan lives with me, so he's going to be playing Star Trek Online.

02:31:31.247 --> 02:31:31.447
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, shit.

02:31:32.774 --> 02:31:35.517
[SPEAKER_11]: Lock yourself in your room and get a laptop.

02:31:35.717 --> 02:31:36.898
[SPEAKER_02]: See this wallpaper?

02:31:37.979 --> 02:31:38.660
[SPEAKER_02]: Deep Space Nine.

02:31:39.041 --> 02:31:39.321
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.

02:31:39.581 --> 02:31:40.382
[SPEAKER_01]: Star Trek Online.

02:31:41.023 --> 02:31:41.443
[SPEAKER_01]: It's okay.

02:31:41.763 --> 02:31:42.764
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what's terrible?

02:31:42.804 --> 02:31:44.887
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was a teenager, I was a Trekkie.

02:31:45.367 --> 02:31:46.368
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean hardcore.

02:31:46.869 --> 02:31:50.593
[SPEAKER_01]: The posters, the movies, you know, knowing Klingon, the whole works.

02:31:51.033 --> 02:31:52.074
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a show.

02:31:52.515 --> 02:31:52.715
[SPEAKER_01]: Huh?

02:31:53.553 --> 02:31:54.854
[SPEAKER_07]: It was the show on television.

02:31:54.894 --> 02:31:55.154
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

02:31:55.454 --> 02:32:00.617
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, now my wife, ten years too late, has decided that she's going to be a Trekkie.

02:32:00.997 --> 02:32:01.697
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no, no.

02:32:01.717 --> 02:32:04.779
[SPEAKER_01]: That would have worked out for me, you know, years ago.

02:32:04.979 --> 02:32:06.520
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's just like, really?

02:32:06.880 --> 02:32:07.441
[SPEAKER_01]: Star Trek?

02:32:07.641 --> 02:32:08.261
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cute.

02:32:08.561 --> 02:32:09.241
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no, no.

02:32:09.281 --> 02:32:11.323
[SPEAKER_01]: Although, admittedly, I do kind of want some con cologne.

02:32:11.343 --> 02:32:13.304
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you take her to the tour that's at Mather?

02:32:13.324 --> 02:32:14.224
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we stopped to go.

02:32:14.324 --> 02:32:15.145
[SPEAKER_01]: I do want to go to Mather.

02:32:15.185 --> 02:32:15.705
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep in mind.

02:32:15.745 --> 02:32:16.325
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep in mind.

02:32:16.866 --> 02:32:17.926
[SPEAKER_01]: OLR day at Mather.

02:32:18.126 --> 02:32:20.247
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep in mind, I missed Deep Space Nine when it was on TV.

02:32:20.267 --> 02:32:20.648
[SPEAKER_01]: We can double date.

02:32:21.628 --> 02:32:21.968
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

02:32:43.141 --> 02:32:46.202
[SPEAKER_01]: Star Trek Online, though, admittedly looks like a pretty neat game.

02:32:46.362 --> 02:32:47.742
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, back to the caller.

02:32:47.802 --> 02:32:48.442
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, caller.

02:32:49.063 --> 02:32:49.383
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.

02:32:49.583 --> 02:32:53.304
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, so about those erotic chats, huh?

02:32:55.444 --> 02:32:56.304
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep, he does.

02:32:56.604 --> 02:32:58.445
[SPEAKER_11]: What did you call in to ask us about tonight?

02:32:58.465 --> 02:33:00.906
[SPEAKER_11]: He just wanted to remind you that you erotically chat, Rob.

02:33:01.166 --> 02:33:01.666
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, sorry.

02:33:02.146 --> 02:33:04.947
[SPEAKER_11]: You just wanted to bring up those late night chats live on air.

02:33:04.987 --> 02:33:05.507
[SPEAKER_11]: I see how it is.

02:33:05.527 --> 02:33:05.847
[SPEAKER_11]: That's fine.

02:33:06.987 --> 02:33:08.587
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me read some of these transcripts.

02:33:09.008 --> 02:33:10.148
[SPEAKER_11]: Seriously, let the man talk.

02:33:10.188 --> 02:33:10.448
[SPEAKER_11]: What's up?

02:33:13.746 --> 02:33:17.367
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I wanted to talk about the... Now I can't even think.

02:33:17.407 --> 02:33:19.388
[SPEAKER_07]: Now I got all derailed by the whole chat thing.

02:33:19.668 --> 02:33:21.668
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, welcome to my life tonight.

02:33:21.688 --> 02:33:22.749
[SPEAKER_11]: Welcome to OLR.

02:33:23.509 --> 02:33:26.150
[SPEAKER_11]: Jamie was like, hey, Dan should host the show while Loki's gone.

02:33:26.170 --> 02:33:28.071
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, oh, sure, that sounds like a great idea.

02:33:29.531 --> 02:33:30.791
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Dan's going to be great.

02:33:30.872 --> 02:33:31.692
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, no, Dan's been fun.

02:33:31.732 --> 02:33:32.212
[SPEAKER_11]: Dan's fun.

02:33:32.392 --> 02:33:32.992
[SPEAKER_01]: Guess what?

02:33:33.232 --> 02:33:33.452
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

02:33:33.632 --> 02:33:34.893
[SPEAKER_01]: You get the hell out of my house.

02:33:36.660 --> 02:33:38.781
[SPEAKER_01]: You can host from your new car.

02:33:40.602 --> 02:33:40.902
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

02:33:40.962 --> 02:33:42.542
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Rob could take it in.

02:33:43.062 --> 02:33:43.843
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

02:33:43.883 --> 02:33:44.703
[SPEAKER_01]: Dream on.

02:33:45.583 --> 02:33:46.504
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't say how.

02:33:46.644 --> 02:33:47.764
[SPEAKER_04]: I just said I think you could.

02:33:48.124 --> 02:33:50.365
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, I don't even want to go into that conversation.

02:33:50.465 --> 02:33:50.765
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

02:33:51.225 --> 02:33:51.665
[SPEAKER_11]: X-Link, hi.

02:33:51.685 --> 02:33:52.666
[SPEAKER_01]: This is getting inappropriate.

02:33:52.686 --> 02:33:53.966
[SPEAKER_11]: Where every gamer has a voice.

02:33:53.986 --> 02:33:56.427
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyways, how about those erotic chats?

02:33:58.868 --> 02:34:00.288
[SPEAKER_11]: What about it?

02:34:01.349 --> 02:34:04.270
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe you were going to ask something else until you were rudely derailed.

02:34:05.368 --> 02:34:06.669
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, no.

02:34:07.029 --> 02:34:08.090
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I can't think of what it is now.

02:34:08.810 --> 02:34:10.431
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I'm just going to leave it at that.

02:34:10.692 --> 02:34:12.473
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, well have a great week, X-Link!

02:34:12.733 --> 02:34:13.834
[SPEAKER_11]: Erotic chats!

02:34:14.014 --> 02:34:15.555
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for the call, I think.

02:34:16.615 --> 02:34:17.236
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a good one.

02:34:17.336 --> 02:34:18.196
[SPEAKER_01]: It was good to talk to you.

02:34:18.236 --> 02:34:18.637
[SPEAKER_01]: You too.

02:34:21.398 --> 02:34:21.939
[SPEAKER_01]: I enjoyed that.

02:34:21.959 --> 02:34:22.799
[SPEAKER_01]: He sounded like a good guy.

02:34:26.874 --> 02:34:27.594
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate this show.

02:34:27.754 --> 02:34:28.074
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

02:34:28.094 --> 02:34:29.635
[SPEAKER_11]: You're loving it.

02:34:29.915 --> 02:34:31.195
[SPEAKER_11]: I do love this show.

02:34:31.236 --> 02:34:32.636
[SPEAKER_11]: You've got a big smile on your face.

02:34:32.816 --> 02:34:33.036
[SPEAKER_01]: I do.

02:34:33.076 --> 02:34:33.576
[SPEAKER_11]: This is fun.

02:34:34.116 --> 02:34:35.177
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

02:34:35.197 --> 02:34:37.077
[SPEAKER_11]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:34:37.098 --> 02:34:37.938
[SPEAKER_11]: Use the name on Skype.

02:34:38.138 --> 02:34:39.358
[SPEAKER_11]: It's orange.

02:34:39.498 --> 02:34:40.159
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, here's the thing, though.

02:34:40.179 --> 02:34:44.740
[SPEAKER_11]: When Loki comes back, you guys, you have to say, oh, the show sucked when you weren't there.

02:34:44.880 --> 02:34:50.102
[SPEAKER_11]: It just wasn't working without you there because I don't want him to feel bad.

02:34:51.488 --> 02:34:52.269
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what's weird though?

02:34:52.530 --> 02:34:54.933
[SPEAKER_11]: He's probably listening to us.

02:34:54.973 --> 02:34:57.637
[SPEAKER_11]: The show is always better when one of us is missing.

02:34:57.737 --> 02:35:06.390
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, you know Jamie missed episode 69, which was that epic night that Loki sang the karaoke revolution and is like one of our greatest moments ever.

02:35:06.410 --> 02:35:07.712
[SPEAKER_03]: He's saying, I'm staying in.

02:35:07.992 --> 02:35:09.054
[SPEAKER_11]: and I was gone.

02:35:09.074 --> 02:35:14.381
[SPEAKER_11]: I was gone one night and this show just totally like, I don't even know what happened.

02:35:14.642 --> 02:35:20.130
[SPEAKER_11]: They were watching a Ron Jeremy biography live on air and commenting on it.

02:35:20.150 --> 02:35:22.914
[SPEAKER_01]: You wait until 378 when we pay all our Mad Libs.

02:35:24.520 --> 02:35:25.942
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, which episode was that?

02:35:26.242 --> 02:35:27.264
[SPEAKER_11]: It will be epic.

02:35:27.284 --> 02:35:28.405
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, can we take another call, please?

02:35:28.506 --> 02:35:28.706
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

02:35:29.207 --> 02:35:30.689
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, who said no?

02:35:31.470 --> 02:35:31.950
[SPEAKER_11]: Misty?

02:35:32.151 --> 02:35:33.232
[SPEAKER_11]: Misty's the new director.

02:35:33.633 --> 02:35:35.275
[SPEAKER_11]: Vito, take the call.

02:35:35.315 --> 02:35:35.976
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, I'm hanging up.

02:35:36.016 --> 02:35:36.497
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I'm kidding.

02:35:36.837 --> 02:35:37.919
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:35:37.939 --> 02:35:38.279
[SPEAKER_11]: Who's this?

02:35:39.707 --> 02:35:43.469
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, this is your family neighborhood Rick Roller Spazinator.

02:35:43.489 --> 02:35:44.770
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi Spazinator, it didn't work.

02:35:45.050 --> 02:35:46.391
[SPEAKER_11]: I had the sound off, haha.

02:35:46.851 --> 02:35:47.852
[SPEAKER_11]: What's up?

02:35:48.552 --> 02:35:55.856
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, after a couple years of having that, I know I'm kind of late to the whole Rick Rolling thing, but I figured I'd do it at least once.

02:35:57.077 --> 02:36:04.581
[SPEAKER_06]: But at any rate, two little tidbits of information, probably one of which you may already know about.

02:36:06.093 --> 02:36:11.216
[SPEAKER_06]: but I can't figure you would like to know about since you're really big on the music based games.

02:36:12.817 --> 02:36:23.322
[SPEAKER_06]: From what I've heard through Gravevine, supposedly DDR is coming to both the 360 and PlayStation 3.

02:36:25.843 --> 02:36:32.146
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't really follow DDR at all, so I don't know

02:36:33.021 --> 02:36:49.061
[SPEAKER_06]: Which a version of DDR is coming to the systems, but since I know that you are into DDR, I kind of figured the fact that it's coming out to newer systems may pique your interest.

02:36:49.767 --> 02:36:51.188
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right, motherfucker!

02:36:51.208 --> 02:36:51.428
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, bitch!

02:36:51.648 --> 02:36:51.848
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

02:36:51.888 --> 02:36:51.968
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

02:37:19.400 --> 02:37:20.861
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's Rick Wall and who now?

02:37:22.082 --> 02:37:26.004
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no stranger to love.

02:37:26.484 --> 02:37:28.145
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that deserved a Pikachu beatdown.

02:37:28.265 --> 02:37:30.026
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, I just got smacked with a Pikachu.

02:37:30.786 --> 02:37:32.868
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got shrivels on my screen, Rob.

02:37:33.948 --> 02:37:36.970
[SPEAKER_01]: When Rob gets smacked with a Pikachu, he usually means something else.

02:37:37.350 --> 02:37:38.451
[SPEAKER_03]: Where did you put Angus?

02:37:39.790 --> 02:37:41.291
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell are you talking about?

02:37:41.331 --> 02:37:41.911
[SPEAKER_03]: My Tribble!

02:37:42.351 --> 02:37:43.251
[SPEAKER_03]: It was in the blue bucket.

02:37:45.132 --> 02:37:46.853
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn, don't tell me right away about another Tribble.

02:37:46.953 --> 02:37:47.893
[SPEAKER_11]: Angus is in the closet.

02:37:47.933 --> 02:37:48.333
[SPEAKER_11]: Hold on.

02:37:49.013 --> 02:37:56.016
[SPEAKER_11]: Spazinator actually had a question, and I may or may not want to answer it, about what DDR version.

02:37:56.256 --> 02:37:57.076
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's the thing, Spazinator.

02:37:57.136 --> 02:37:58.317
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, this is my honest answer.

02:37:58.977 --> 02:38:04.119
[SPEAKER_11]: As far as these DDR games go, the new ones that are coming out, we don't know a lot about them, period.

02:38:04.159 --> 02:38:07.420
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what makes this press event that's happening this week so interesting is

02:38:07.760 --> 02:38:32.490
[SPEAKER_11]: is because we had all this information about the Xbox and PlayStation DDRs coming out and then suddenly there was nothing for a while but I think what happened is that at E3 then we saw Dance Masters come out and Dance Masters is a Xbox 360 game so that the PlayStation 3 users have something here is my guess and I honestly believe this is the honest to God truth the game that was going to come out on the 360 and PlayStation 3

02:38:33.130 --> 02:38:36.912
[SPEAKER_11]: Now canceled on the 360 in favor of Dance Masters.

02:38:37.332 --> 02:38:42.694
[SPEAKER_11]: But for those folks that don't have a 360, you get Dance Dance Revolution on the PlayStation 3.

02:38:43.334 --> 02:38:45.035
[SPEAKER_11]: I honestly kind of think that's where things went.

02:38:46.515 --> 02:38:51.037
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's really hard to say if this new PlayStation 3 game is going to be good or not until we know more about it.

02:38:52.118 --> 02:38:54.939
[SPEAKER_11]: From what we heard a couple years ago, it's like a greatest hits...

02:38:55.399 --> 02:39:23.792
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of the famous songs and some new ones Lots of DLC, 8 panel dancing It certainly makes it sound like it's going to be leaps and bounds better than the 360 games that already exist Because there is Universe 1, 2, and 3 But I think the PlayStation 3 one, you know, it's the first DDR game I'm not even acknowledging the Wii ones because they're ridiculous But it's the first real DDR game we've had in a couple years And if they've actually rebuilt it from the ground up and so forth, it might be kind of cool That's my thought Yeah

02:39:24.727 --> 02:39:35.511
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, as someone that's never touched a music game, aside from some of the older Guitar Hero games and The Rock Band games, I'm willing to at least give it a try.

02:39:36.212 --> 02:39:45.138
[SPEAKER_06]: Spazinator, before you go buy DDR on the PlayStation 3, which will cost you at least $60, honestly, if you want to try it and see if you like it, you can find dance games on the PlayStation 1, because I don't think you have a 360.

02:39:45.198 --> 02:39:45.658
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have a 360?

02:39:45.718 --> 02:39:45.838
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

02:40:01.238 --> 02:40:01.718
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I do.

02:40:01.978 --> 02:40:02.238
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, okay.

02:40:02.258 --> 02:40:02.919
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, then, never mind.

02:40:03.299 --> 02:40:07.120
[SPEAKER_11]: You can go buy a cheap dance pad for, like, no more than $20.

02:40:07.580 --> 02:40:12.542
[SPEAKER_11]: And you could probably... Like, DarkSakura found the fancy dance pads at a local... I bought three of them for $6.

02:40:12.702 --> 02:40:14.203
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, they're, like, super cheap.

02:40:14.483 --> 02:40:17.004
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you look at, like, discount stores and stuff, you might find them even cheaper.

02:40:17.064 --> 02:40:19.524
[SPEAKER_11]: But no more than $20 for a cheap game pad.

02:40:19.865 --> 02:40:26.127
[SPEAKER_11]: And, like, DDR Universe 2 at GameStop, I shit you not, I saw it in a bin the other day, $7 used.

02:40:26.547 --> 02:40:27.807
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would say for $27...

02:40:29.628 --> 02:40:54.033
[SPEAKER_11]: try it and if you think the game is fun and you're like hey I want like a more souped up version of this this is kind of fun this is getting me moving and burning calories then drop the 60 bucks on the PlayStation 3 but if you're not sure Spazinator don't don't spend more than 30 bucks doing the trial run because you'll still yeah I mean you're still getting a decent game out of it it's not that the 360 games are bad they're not they're just you know they're they're they're dated at this point

02:40:55.464 --> 02:40:57.305
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'll definitely look into it.

02:40:57.525 --> 02:41:06.991
[SPEAKER_06]: Granted, it's going to be a while before I buy even a used retail game, because money's kind of, you know, tight at the moment.

02:41:07.031 --> 02:41:13.936
[SPEAKER_06]: But before I do let you go, there's one more thing I just want to pass along.

02:41:14.056 --> 02:41:14.436
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, sir.

02:41:14.476 --> 02:41:19.579
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if it's on the Xbox Marketplace just yet or not.

02:41:19.859 --> 02:41:21.901
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been a couple days since I checked it, but...

02:41:22.785 --> 02:41:41.020
[SPEAKER_06]: at least over on the game side of the PSN store there is I guess it amounts to a half hour long machinima movie that Rockstar Games had made using Red Dead Redemption.

02:41:41.340 --> 02:41:42.181
[SPEAKER_11]: Interesting.

02:41:43.021 --> 02:41:51.228
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, totally free download, will cost you cents and it clocks in and literally

02:41:51.818 --> 02:41:55.579
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah, you know, based on the description I read on, uh,

02:42:18.502 --> 02:42:29.611
[SPEAKER_06]: and I think on the video itself towards the end, the half hour movie is supposed to serve as like a prequel to the actual game.

02:42:30.411 --> 02:42:30.752
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

02:42:31.312 --> 02:42:34.975
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, Spaznator, we're going to let you go so we can take more calls or wrap the show up.

02:42:34.995 --> 02:42:37.297
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know what we're going to do yet, but have a good one, buddy, okay?

02:42:38.348 --> 02:42:39.648
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep, you too, take care Later

02:43:08.109 --> 02:43:09.030
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a new regime here.

02:43:09.050 --> 02:43:11.011
[SPEAKER_11]: To be on the show.

02:43:11.031 --> 02:43:13.914
[SPEAKER_11]: 1-877-GAME-OLR Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

02:43:15.795 --> 02:43:16.696
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:43:16.716 --> 02:43:17.077
[SPEAKER_11]: Who's this?

02:43:18.037 --> 02:43:18.818
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, it's Ranma.

02:43:18.918 --> 02:43:19.499
[SPEAKER_11]: Hold on, hold on.

02:43:19.539 --> 02:43:25.884
[SPEAKER_11]: Before we take your call, Ranma, Producer Misty, Producer Misty, is there anything you want to make Ranma do to see if we can take his call tonight or not?

02:43:28.634 --> 02:43:29.955
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought that it was him, so he's cool.

02:43:30.195 --> 02:43:31.056
[SPEAKER_11]: Take off your pants!

02:43:31.296 --> 02:43:31.736
[SPEAKER_11]: Yodel!

02:43:32.397 --> 02:43:35.119
[SPEAKER_04]: Eat my terrible cooking!

02:43:35.139 --> 02:43:36.260
[SPEAKER_11]: Your cooking isn't terrible.

02:43:36.880 --> 02:43:38.301
[SPEAKER_03]: Misty's our Nakane.

02:43:38.362 --> 02:43:39.703
[SPEAKER_11]: You have a lovely taco.

02:43:40.423 --> 02:43:47.329
[SPEAKER_03]: Mystique is our local fusion of Nabiki and Akane, so she's our Nakane.

02:43:48.937 --> 02:43:53.538
[SPEAKER_14]: You guys are starting to scare the living shit out of me right now.

02:43:53.618 --> 02:43:54.038
[SPEAKER_14]: That's alright.

02:43:54.358 --> 02:43:54.638
[SPEAKER_14]: Good!

02:43:56.258 --> 02:43:57.879
[SPEAKER_11]: Wait, you just tuned in, didn't you?

02:43:58.559 --> 02:44:00.699
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, I just tuned in and got rip-rolled.

02:44:00.759 --> 02:44:01.959
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm like, what the hell?

02:44:02.100 --> 02:44:06.500
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to say, this show, like, yeah.

02:44:07.921 --> 02:44:09.541
[SPEAKER_01]: This show has been awesome.

02:44:10.461 --> 02:44:12.862
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been doing backflips over the shark all evening.

02:44:12.882 --> 02:44:15.062
[SPEAKER_01]: It has much more Dan than any other show has ever had.

02:44:16.681 --> 02:44:37.909
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm on the road with DDR Darla Bill we're coming back from somewhere and I get a text from GL saying that her boobs got nicknames now I'm dealing with my phone trying to get the stream to work with no avail you're trying to get the stream to work stop it right now Ranma, I'm so sorry for Dan

02:44:43.411 --> 02:44:44.411
[SPEAKER_03]: He's met Dan before.

02:44:47.092 --> 02:44:48.152
[SPEAKER_03]: He slept at my house.

02:44:48.652 --> 02:44:51.793
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, Dan just pitched Pikachu.

02:44:51.973 --> 02:44:55.614
[SPEAKER_11]: Can we ask what Ranma... Yes.

02:44:55.734 --> 02:44:57.354
[SPEAKER_11]: Can we ask Ranma why he called in tonight?

02:44:57.374 --> 02:44:59.315
[SPEAKER_11]: We all know Ranma.

02:44:59.555 --> 02:44:59.975
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, Ranma.

02:45:01.115 --> 02:45:06.816
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't have much to contribute except for the fact that DJ Hero bundles are now $40 at Best Buy.

02:45:07.717 --> 02:45:08.097
[SPEAKER_11]: Sweet.

02:45:08.317 --> 02:45:09.417
[SPEAKER_11]: Now they'll sell a million more.

02:45:10.479 --> 02:45:28.491
[SPEAKER_14]: I know, I went online earlier this morning and ordered mine and I went to check other places because it seems that Kmart was the first one to do and I was trying to get a price match but Best Buy has it but I find it funny that GameStop is selling their bundles for $49.99 online only and stores still $100 on related news to that

02:45:29.391 --> 02:45:32.054
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a great example of how failed the PS3 is.

02:45:32.895 --> 02:45:37.479
[SPEAKER_01]: At Fry's, the Super Deluxe Logitech Guitar Hero controllers.

02:45:37.539 --> 02:45:39.121
[SPEAKER_01]: They get the drum and the guitar.

02:45:40.182 --> 02:45:40.823
[SPEAKER_01]: 50 bucks a piece.

02:45:41.103 --> 02:45:42.084
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow.

02:45:42.104 --> 02:45:42.764
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you serious?

02:45:42.965 --> 02:45:44.746
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, because those are $200 controllers.

02:45:45.047 --> 02:45:48.210
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking at that and I'm like, if they have 361s, they're bought.

02:45:48.550 --> 02:45:49.191
[SPEAKER_01]: They are bought.

02:45:49.291 --> 02:45:50.292
[SPEAKER_01]: Find the 361s, they're still 200 bucks.

02:45:50.552 --> 02:45:50.612
[SPEAKER_01]: Ugh.

02:45:52.874 --> 02:45:59.717
[SPEAKER_14]: because honestly, not for nothing, I would drop $200 on the Logitech ones instead of buying the Mad Catz one because I don't care what anyone says.

02:45:59.997 --> 02:46:01.197
[SPEAKER_14]: Mad Catz controllers and etc.

02:46:01.217 --> 02:46:02.038
[SPEAKER_14]: is a piece of shit.

02:46:03.358 --> 02:46:03.818
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't say.

02:46:04.139 --> 02:46:06.780
[SPEAKER_11]: Frisbee in our chatroom says Toys R Us is at $40 as well.

02:46:06.800 --> 02:46:08.961
[SPEAKER_11]: Their Street Fighter sticks are pretty nice.

02:46:10.441 --> 02:46:16.724
[SPEAKER_11]: I will say though, guys, now, if you're at all interested in DJ Hero 2, now's the time to go get your controller.

02:46:17.024 --> 02:46:17.404
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

02:46:17.964 --> 02:46:20.945
[SPEAKER_11]: And get practically a free DJ Hero 1 with it.

02:46:21.065 --> 02:46:21.426
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

02:46:21.466 --> 02:46:21.846
[SPEAKER_11]: There you go.

[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

02:46:25.052 --> 02:46:28.254
[SPEAKER_14]: Or if you're smart, you buy two bundles and you trade in one game.

02:46:29.435 --> 02:46:29.975
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not smart.

02:46:30.675 --> 02:46:31.376
[SPEAKER_11]: I just went cross-eyed.

02:46:32.096 --> 02:46:32.377

[SPEAKER_11]: You've been making fun of me.

02:49:10.057 --> 02:49:11.898
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean... Sounds like you're opposing me, Rob.

02:49:11.958 --> 02:49:12.599
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I'm not opposing you.

02:49:12.619 --> 02:49:14.640
[SPEAKER_01]: I already told you what happens to people who oppose me.

02:49:14.680 --> 02:49:18.583
[SPEAKER_11]: But you've actually been hilarious, and I know the listeners love you, so thank you very much for being here tonight.

[SPEAKER_11]: It depends on Matt.

02:49:24.227 --> 02:49:25.568
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know what's going to happen, so we'll see.

02:49:25.908 --> 02:49:29.771
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as there's no Matt and I have nothing better to do, I'll be back.

02:49:29.951 --> 02:49:32.973
[SPEAKER_11]: Even if Matt is here, I'm sure we would all love it if you'd at least drop in.

02:49:33.013 --> 02:49:34.034
[SPEAKER_11]: Kind of do the Mystique thing.

02:49:34.074 --> 02:49:35.255
[SPEAKER_11]: Run in the room, say something, and run away.

02:49:35.615 --> 02:49:36.776
[SPEAKER_01]: I just like sitting at my own desk.

02:49:36.796 --> 02:49:37.116
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

02:49:38.097 --> 02:49:38.777
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good, isn't it?
