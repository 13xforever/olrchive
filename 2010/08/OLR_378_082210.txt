A new drawing tablet is announced for the Wii

Orange Lounge Radio
Hello my friends on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio
We are that show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle
We like to think of ourselves as the place where every gamer has a voice
My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my awesome co-hosts
Say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers
Yo, what up?
How are you doing, Jamie Summers?
My head is a nightmare of pain
I'm sorry to hear that, you seem to be in a relatively good mood tonight, all things considered
Yeah, it's just, it's like, you wanna know, it's not really like a headache
It's like being, having sore muscles in my head
Interesting, and what else do the voices in your head tell you?
Tell me to punch you in the face, no I'm kidding
It tells me that Dan's three bean salad is amazing and you should have some
I may have to a little later, when I'm finished downing these yummy parmesan, garlic, and herb pita chips
that I managed to eat the entire bag over the course of a week
We should totally take a picture of you modeling them, Rob
Perhaps I will in a moment
Maybe later, then the whole chat can see my Journey shirt
Of course, when Dark Sakura talks about taking pictures, they usually go right to our website
if you don't already know about it, www.orangeloungeradio.com
I'm trying to think what else is on orangeloungeradio.com for them to look at
Occasionally a story will be posted, what? That my phone is in the bedroom and I'm too lazy to go get it
Well, I guess that segment of the show just got shot, didn't it?
No, I'll go get the camera in a minute
Canceled due to laziness
I'll go get the camera in a minute
Which by the way, speaking of which, did you miss us last week everybody?
We're back after a week off
Last week was cancelled due to gay
Yes actually, partially it was
Although I wouldn't say Loki's baby is a part of that
But yeah, I was at a Lady Gaga concert, what? And what?
Judge me, I don't care
I'm not, because I've had a change of heart
We can talk about that later
But I want to introduce, because he's back, we've missed him
He's been gone for a few weeks, but he is back in the house tonight
Say hello to Loki
Hello
Techmaster Loki, how are you doing?
I'm fine
Tell us about the baby, we all want to know
He's not doing much, he just pretty much sleeps and poops and eats and that's about it
And he's awake every now and then for a few hours
But we've been trying to get him to sleep a little bit better at night
He looks like it's kind of funny, at night he doesn't sleep too deeply
And looks like he makes all these arm and leg movements
So it looks like he's fighting somebody in his sleep
It's kind of funny
Hopefully it's not his father
No, he's just like, and kicking his legs up and stuff
Interesting
Has he resisted the swaddling?
He doesn't like to be swaddled, really
Neither did Becky's son
They always say that babies should be swaddled when they're really young
I've seen more babies than not, just completely hate it
It's so weird that everybody has babies now
He liked it at first, I think he gets hot
He takes after me, so we run really warm
And it's not fun to have a tight blanket on you when you're really hot
There was one picture of him that I have to say, he looked like a little monkey
He does look like a little monkey, he also looks like
Oh, what's his name?
One of the kids from Malcolm in the Middle
Wow
Dewey, he looks like Dewey from Malcolm in the Middle
Let's go to our chatroom at chat.orangelaungeradio.com
Where our chatters can chat with us live as we do tape Sunday nights at All Games Radio
www.allgames.com is where you can listen to our show live
We do tape 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at All Games Radio
But if you want to chat live during the show, you gotta go to a different website
chat.orangelaungeradio.com
And that's our thing, where every gamer has a voice
You know, yeah, we talk about news, but I'm sure most of you that go to the trouble to download gaming blogs
Or download gaming podcasts probably also read gaming blogs
So I know you get your news from there, but we talk about it with you guys and get some different perspectives
But tonight, it's a lot of questions about Loki
Toygak says, holy shit, I missed you
I don't know if he's talking about the show in general or Loki or both or what, but there you go
Spazinator says, you were gone? LOLJK
DJ Dark Knight says, where's our cigars?
I don't know, is that a tradition people still do anymore?
I thought after all the whole smoking kills stuff
You know, and they really frown on smoking in general, they don't do the cigars so much anymore
I've seen candy cigars, but not the real ones
That's dumb
Bobby Black Wolf, the man who does the show before us here at All Games Radio
Has a great question, does he appreciate the nursery?
He doesn't really use the nursery yet because he's still sleeping in our room in a little portable crib
He will eventually use the nursery
No, not yet, he does not appreciate the nursery yet
I don't think he can even see the nursery yet
Really only can see about 8 to 12 inches in front of him
Because his eyes aren't fully developed yet
He can see red though
He can see red, there's not much red in that room though
But yeah, so he doesn't quite appreciate it yet
Our friends though, their son who's like a year and three months now
He loves that room, he just goes in and is like ahhhh
And just like, goes crazy
So yeah, I'm sure he will appreciate it later on
He's just, he's a little young right now
Were you here the week we talked about how your pictures got on a gaming blog
Or was that the night Josh was born?
I think that was the week that Josh was born
Yeah, your pictures made it onto what, Game Informer?
Some pretty big magazine
And we were kind of like laughing because
It had nothing to do with the fact that you're here on Orange Launch Radio
Which you know, it's fine, nobody listens to the show
Except the few faithful folks we've had over the years
But you just cracked me up because they found your photos on Flickr
And thought it made for a good story
But I think that just goes to show like
Yeah sure, a lot of people may have thought of doing a Mario themed nursery for their babies
But Matt took the full effort with it
It went all out
I still haven't finished his mobile yet, but
Like I said, I'm not really in a hurry because he's not using his crib yet
He's not going to learn to appreciate it for a little while
Nah, he doesn't really care about mobiles and stuff like that right now
I mean, he's got his swing, has little animals dangling from it
He could care less
He'll never realize what cool parents he has
Doing his room in the video game theme, you know
Because like, by the time he's a teenager
Well, obviously the room will be changed by the time he's a teenager
By the time he's like, you know
It's time for that nursery theme to be changed
He'll probably be like, man, video games are lame
All my parents, or all my dad does is talk about video games
No, he won't do that
I'm just messing
Alright, look, he's spoiled because he'll be like
Oh, and they're like, oh man, I really wish I had like a Wii 2 or something
Be like, ah, I already got that
I bought that for myself
But hey, you can use it if you want, you know
He'll never get to play them because his dad will always be using it
He's like, hey, I want to play this game, got it for you
Alright, we got to introduce somebody else here in the studio
Because he's been so good and patient
Sitting there for like seven minutes
While we've been doing the intro to the show
But he's here in studio, and you've heard him before
He's here, it's Alan, also known as Salacious Pop
Is joining us in the studio tonight
Hello everyone
Oh, what a weekend I've had
I'm hanging in there
Tell us about it, because your weekend and my weekend were very similar
Yes, we had a road trip up to Reno
Because the Rocky Horror Troop that Rob is a part of
Was doing a Rocky Horror performance
For about
3, 500 people we think
The number is still debated
Like, I've heard everywhere from 2,000
To 6,800
And they do it in an arena
It's definitely the largest showing they do regularly
In the country
I think there was once a large, large, large show in LA
But, I mean, this is the largest regular show they do
Where it's literally thousands of people
And honestly, at that point
2,500, 6,800
Looks all the same to me
It's a lot of fun
So, I'd never been to Reno before
So I was really excited to
Go gamble a little bit
And I came down
With food poisoning
And was sick as a dog
For a day and a half
While we were up there
I know, and I was worried that you were going to get
That whole associated response thing with Reno
So the next time I said, hey, let's go to Reno
You'd just think about, like, barfing
And you'd be like, no, I don't want to go
I started to feel kind of
Fluish and crappy during the car ride up
And I'm like, alright, 3 hour car ride, change in elevation
I just feel kind of icky
Hit the buffet, no, my stomach was like
That was a bad plan
That was your first mistake
You didn't condition yourself with enough junk food
Beforehand, see
You can't go to
Really anywhere in Nevada
And not have a buffet at some point
Unless you live there
I'm sure we have plenty of listeners in Las Vegas
Going, ugh, I'm sick of fucking
Hearing about buffets
They suck, they're terrible
They can shut up because they have Krispy Kreme
And Krispy Kreme is awesome
And I wish we still had it here
Instead of it's going to be what
What were they turning into, a Chick-fil-A?
A Panera bread
A Panera, screw it
Put it back to being
A Krispy Kreme again
I didn't care less about Panera
That building's been empty for like 3 years
It's been a very long time
It's longer than 3 years
Finally they're putting a Panera bread in there
I like Panera bread, I think they're a really good
Healthy place to eat
I don't like them because they're egg sandwiches
They don't scramble their eggs
They just kind of fry it
And then you get chunks of
If it's egg salad, it shouldn't be
Did you say egg or egg salad?
No, they're breakfast sandwiches with eggs on them
By the way, once in a while
We do stop talking about food and start talking about video games
Just once you know it's not a Food Network podcast
It's a game podcast
If they had scrambled their eggs, it'd be
An even distribution between the yolk and the white
And the problem is, when you fry it like that
You get these big chunks of yolk
And it doesn't taste very good
Plus they don't season anything
And it's terrible
Really wish it was a Krispy Kreme again
Next time, if you really want
One of these nights, when I come back from the Bay Area
I'll have to do it when Jamie's not looking
Because she'll be mad
That's awesome
From the Bay Area, because they still have them there
You know what, I want
One Krispy Kreme in particular
Which one?
So you say the Cheesecake Donut
As much as I like them
My favorite to this day is
Still the Eclair
Because I do love the custard
I might have to think about doing that
Is there one on the way home for me?
I think there is
You should just take me to the Bay Area
Would you just take you?
Just take me there
There's one near me in Daly City
I don't know where you would stay for the night
I mean, you can't sleep in the bed with
What?
Okay, you're gonna lonely roam the streets
Alright, anyhow
I'll be driving around singing Journey songs
Act F in our chatroom says
It isn't OLR without Orange Lounge Foodie-O
Don't you know it
Monty Boggs says
I click off once they stop talking about food
They would be heaven
I'm sure there is a donut buffet somewhere
There's gotta be
That would be kind of dangerous
Now I've heard about this thing
I'm just perpetuating the food thing
I've heard about this thing now where they're making hamburgers
Out of Krispy Kreme donuts
The Luther
There's a name for these?
It's because they figured out that website
ThisIsWhyYoureFat.com
And people are like
That's really bad for you
And then we get publication
Because people talk about it
And how crazy it is
It's ridiculous
It's a trend that I wish would go away
There was an episode of the Boondocks
On Cartoon Network
Specifically about the grandpa opening up a soul food restaurant
With the Luther
Wow
It seems like one of those foods
You get at the State Fair
The State Fair is the home of
Terribly bad for you food
I'll just make a deep fried hamburger
I don't know
Take the whole hamburger
You've had a Monte Cristo before
Is that what they call it?
Yeah
I tried to get Rob to order one
Even when he described it
It was a deep fried ham and cheese sandwich
It's thick sourdough toast
With ham and Swiss
And then it's dipped in a sweet batter
Deep fried
And then served with strawberry jam and powdered sugar
It's ham and cheese
French toast with crap on it
There's a lot of things I don't like about that
I don't like crap on my French toast
Other than maybe powdered sugar
And I really don't like powdered sugar if I can get it without it
I don't really care for jams
And jellies and stuff like that
And also I hate Swiss
He's quite a picky eater
I am a picky eater
Swiss is one of the lowest sodium cheeses
Also random
I saw that on the menu
Of course there are still Bennigan's
What they need to do is they need to take a burger
Bread it in the pub
Is that what it's called?
I don't know what Bennigan's is
I've seen it
I've never been there
Didn't we go at California Extreme?
No we went to IHOP
No we went to Bennigan's and then IHOP
You guys went to Bennigan's during the day
Dan and I showed up later
We went to Bennigan's
I'm sorry I'm distracted
I'm trying to get into how is your gaming week
But I have to ask Darsakra
She likes to surf the web during this show
She's on Facebook right now looking at pictures of Carol Channing
What?
The company that I work at
That I'm about to get laid off of
I found my boss's Facebook page
My first boss who hired me
And I'm looking at his photos of him
He was Carol Channing?
You were hired by Carol Channing?
Do you like raspberries?
Hired!
But he's the world's biggest Ann-Margret fan
And he's also
He's gone to her house
Got tons of photos
He and his partner
Have met
Her and her husband
And gone to shows
And sat in box seats
But I'm also looking at his other photos
Of other celebrities that he's met
And there's like him and Carol Channing
And Bo Derek and that's pretty cool
He's gonna be really sad in about 10 years
Wish I had pictures
With all the celebrities I've met
I have a picture
With um
My rock star hero
Mr. Castlevania himself
Good times
Yeah, with his wild hair
And him being taller than me
And looking absolutely like he was gonna pee himself
When I asked him in Japanese if I could have a photo
You were there for that
I was, I think I took the photo
Yes you did
And since Dark Sakura brought up Castlevania
I'll use it as a segue to finally talk about games
So Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?
Or two weeks if you wish
I really didn't play much of anything
I played a little pinball
And mostly I watched Dan scream
At his Nintendo emulator
Well today I watched him yell
At Rad Racer
But I wanted to hear the music
And the doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
The one that was used in the
The Strong Bad
Anime one
Anyway
Then Dan played some Turbo Out Run
And Out Runners
It was old school racing to hear it
Fuck it and turn it off
And
I found my Ninja Pass
But I couldn't find my SD
My micro SD card
I think those are pretty cheap to come by
Yeah, I ordered one for five bucks
But the whole reason I wanted it
Is because since I'm going back to the gym
My favorite thing to do is to go
Well, back in the day it was go on the elliptical
And play Pokemans
So now it's gonna be
I guess play whatever
Game I happen to have on me
And I wanted to find some of those
SNES ROM conversions
For the DSI
Nice
And then I can play lots and lots of Seiken 3
Because that's been the game
I've really been wanting to get into
Or just Final Fantasy 6, 3, whatever you want
I have a new game that I'm going to be playing
Thank you to a lack of forgetfulness
Finally, after like a month
I finally remember to bring Dark Sakura
Final Fantasy 13
Yeah, I really should finish that game
I'll be playing the crap out of this
And I start school next week too
Good times, you're gonna be busy
And Tuesday is old school DDR night
At Arviggle
Yes, I'm gonna go
I don't know if I'll actually play Ditter
But I'll definitely play some 2DX
And if they ever
Fix their frickin' Technica machine
I'll play that too
Alright
Maybe I'll play like
One round of DDR
That would be fun, I haven't done that forever
But I'm almost afraid to try again
Just because last time
That's cause I still think
It's humbling, you're gonna have to
Go down to 5 footers to like get yourself
Back into it
I've been playing 6's and 7's and it's been
Fun for me
It's humbling, cause you'll be all like
What was that one song, it's like a 9 footer
It's really fast, the heavenly something
Angelic mix
Oh, Healing Vision Angelic mix, that's it right?
It's one of those really fast
Songs that you dance to in DDR
And it's like super fast 9 footer
Back when I was in my younger
20's when DDR first came out
Or I guess when Max first came out
I was able to pass that song after a little bit of practice
But it didn't almost give me
Like a heart attack like it did when I tried it
I couldn't even finish it
It's insane. Well you remember back in the day
I could play tons of stuff
And now, but this is
How I look at it is
I've got those shiny
Sort of old
Dance pads I picked up at the thrift store
I'm gonna start playing again
I've had no
There's no excuse for me to have
Just not done it
I am really curious about this DDR
I need to bring this up at some point
Because I don't think it's in the show or otherwise
They had the Dance Dance Revolution preview
Party this past week
None of us went, but my buddy Mel
Who you guys all know Mel B
If you've been listening to the show long enough
He's been on before, he went
The pictures looked fun
Think DJ Tyrant who does sometimes an article
Or here or there for our website, he went too
And they said, well dance
Masters was clearly
The game to play there
That was a lot of fun
But the DDR for the PS3
Eh, the move stuff is kind of gimmicky
But otherwise, it's a pretty decent
DDR game and the song list looks
Really cool, like it's got a lot of really good songs
In it I gotta say
I liked the machine they had there
Yeah, there's a new X2 is now coming out
He said that was a sweet song list
And they fixed the dance pads, they're not so crappy anymore
Because X had really bad dance pads
They got DDRX at Dave and Buster's in town
I had to laugh
Sorry to interrupt
Because you mentioned Mel B
I had to laugh because I've been seeing this on my release list
And I finally found the box art for it
They have a game coming out in the week called
Get Fit with Mel B
Apparently there's a woman named Mel B
It's Scary Spice
That's who that is
That's Scary Spice, Mel B
Sorry
Go power blah blah blah
I'm Mel B
I'm the runner up on Dancing with the Stars
On the internet, doesn't know who I am
At any rate
Dan and I are having our fifth wedding anniversary
Oh
And we were gonna
Get folks together on the day before
Because we can't do the $40
Free play thing all day thing
On our actual anniversary
So we were gonna go and
Hit up Dave and Buster's and have like a big party
With whoever wants to show up
What day is this?
31st
It'll be August 31st
I should be here
And the first is our actual fifth year anniversary
And the second is when my conversion goes through
Oh wow
When do you do the whole um
The dip on the second
Oh wow
Fun dip
Good times
And then I will be shiny and new
And then you are officially
Yes
One of the chosen people at that point right?
One of the chosen people
Congrats in advance
Well somehow we completely deviated
From the talk of video games
What did we hit on in there?
Jews, Spice Girls
No but anyway
Loki
I haven't been playing a whole lot
You got a good excuse
I'm trying to think back to what I played at the hospital
On the DS
I don't even know if I played anything on the DS
I played a little bit more of
Spirit Tracks
That game is okay
I just
Some of the Zelda games on the DS
I just don't go through them very quickly
But it's alright
Then mainly
The only thing I've been playing since I got back to work
Has been
The Grand Theft Auto Lost and Damned
Yes we've gone back to Lost and Damned now
Because they were kind of craving
The open world Grand Theft Auto
Deathmatch things
And since you can't really do that
In the Battle of the Gay Tony
We're playing Lost and Damned
It's actually a little bit more fun
It's a little less serious
Because I'm not really trying to get up on the leaderboards
For that
I kind of want to go back to the Battle of the Gay Tony
So I can actually get to the top of the leaderboards
Because I kind of stopped at rank 59
But then on top of all that
I've been working still on
Working on my mods and stuff
For Grand Theft Auto
Because I have a really big one in the works
Right now that's going to be
Completely
Stuff that's never been done before
On the console version
And thankfully I
Upgraded my computer to Windows
7 64 bit
And added another 4 gigs of RAM
So now it runs smoothly
And I can actually run Grand Theft Auto
After having it crash after 5 minutes
There was something weird with the installation
Or something on XP
So now it's really stable
Which is great and I can actually work on it
Lots of baby jokes in the chatroom
Spaznator wants to know if you've been playing Babymaker Extreme
No
Frisbee says Loki has been playing lots of Imagine Babies
No
It's just
Just been playing reality babies
Just been playing washing the bottles
Changing the diapers
Good times
Fun stuff like that
Because now
With the sleep schedule and everything
We have to get up a lot of times
I kind of have to stick to the old person schedule
Where I have to go to bed at 9 o'clock
At night
Well it's been 11
11 o'clock at night is really what we've been sticking to
But sometimes 9 o'clock at night
Or 10
Between 9 and 11
Because I have to get up in the morning like at 5 in the morning
You know with the babies
So
That's how long it takes me to wake up
Is about 2 hours with the baby and stuff
And also on the weekends
I wake up early with the baby
To try to take him out of the room
So if he's fussing
Nelly can sleep some
With all that and having to change him
And do stuff every 3 hours
It really doesn't give me a lot of time to work on anything
So
Gameplay and stuff
I have a lot of stuff to play
Including a lot of things I really shouldn't be playing
I don't think anyone is surprised
That you haven't been able to play
A whole lot lately
We'll get into things I shouldn't be playing right
A little bit later
And then
Yeah just lots of stuff to
To be doing
But I've been mainly just working on the Grand Theft Auto stuff
Because that's what I play at work
And it's going to be so fun
When I mod things done
DarkSakura
You missed something you want to talk about in your week?
I played Star Trek Online
Of course you always do. Anything exciting going on there?
Dabo! The implemented Dabo
So you can gamble for Latinum
And they have Hololita
And they got Chase Masterson to do her voice
Wow
Lots of stuff in that game keeps growing over there
Good times
Alan! How you doing? How was your gaming week?
Pretty uneventful
I played the
Castlevania Harmony of
Schadenfreude or whatever the 360 version is
No I'm joking about the name
The multiplayer one
I played the demo of that, didn't like it
Don't know why
Playing as Alucard, upscaled HD graphics
Castlevania
Gave it two rounds
It's weird
It doesn't feel like other Castlevania games
I hear that the game really shines on its best
When it's multiplayer
No big surprise, most games are better
When it's multiplayer
Playing it normal is really strange
Especially the way the whole map
Is zoomed out in the beginning
Is just kind of a weird
Weird feeling
Some puzzle quests too, still working on that
Can only play that
For maybe 30-45 minutes
At a time because
When you get to the lower levels
I'm almost at the max level
I'm level 43 out of 50
I get to play so much freaking Bejeweled
Just to clear a room, it kind of becomes a grind
And of course World of Warcraft
Got some accomplishments
Done in that
What are your biggest accomplishments in World of Warcraft so far?
50 mounts
And I finally grinded all five cities in Argent Tournament
So I got my super hella exalted Argent champion
With cheesecake achievement
Does Blizzard actually mail you a cheesecake?
I hope so
Because all those dailies, never again
I wanted to die
Man, I would so play an MMO
If they sent you things in real life
For doing all the grinding
I mean you're paying $14.95 a month
Just to send a little cheap
Can you imagine if you're suddenly in the mail one day
Congratulations on your uber mount, here's a cheesecake
I want to play S.T.O. and have them send me
Romulan ale or a warp core breach
That would be a great idea
Davo, you win liquor
But you know there'd be people that would exploit the hell out of that
So they'd have to think of funny ways to put caps on it
But it's kind of like one of those loyalty programs
Like what, Square Enix sends out what
Like iPhones or no, iPod Touches or whatever
If you're like an uber platinum
Bought every game we ever put out member or whatever
But yeah
Anyhow
And our guild is now 6-12 of ICC
Same guild I'm in of course
We got down Rotface and
Festergut
And we're working on Valtheria
Dreamwalker, Healy, Dragon
Which probably was not the best idea for the next boss
Which I don't like that fight at all
So I don't know, we're going back in tomorrow
So maybe we'll do the Blood Princes
Is that what it is? The Blood Queen, the Princes
Princes and then Queen is after them
Yeah we gotta do that whole thing
Wow wow wow
I've been playing a lot of WoW 2 of course
All the same things he's been talking about
Well actually no cause my accomplishments I don't have nearly the same stuff
I haven't done the uber stuff
Alan's really good at focusing on one character
And I've got, I've started to develop
You know as the weight continues on
For Cataclysm, Ultihallism
And you know I've been leveling
A shaman which has been fun
And been slowly
Working on my warrior
Who was lulled at like 76 for the past
Like 4 months, she's up to like 78 now
So I'll probably get her over the hill
To 80 at some point then I'll have another 80
Outside of that though
Another Blizzard game I've been playing a lot of
I finally played
Starcraft 2
Which is old news
To a lot of you guys you know
Those of you that are huge fans of Starcraft
Bought this game the day it came out I'm sure
But you might remember I was very apprehensive
About getting into Starcraft because
The RTS thing I find to be very
Overwhelming especially when I see screenshots
For the game I'm like there's so much shit on the screen
How are you supposed to be able to manage all that
I don't understand this is too complicated
My feeble brain can't handle this
Of course I mentioned a couple weeks on the show
I came to the realization that my ex-boyfriend
Used to play Starcraft and he really
Enjoyed it and was a big fan of it and I'm thinking
If that asshole can play then so can I
So I finally said you know what
I'm going to just suck it up and get Starcraft 2
Because I have a lot of friends that play I'll figure it out
And I've been having a good time with it
It's actually
Quite a bit of fun and it's not nearly as bad
As I thought it would be for learning
At least in the campaign
The campaign very clever
In the way it does it it works into the story
Where like the first mission you don't even
Build structures you're just kind of walking around
And learning how to engage in combat
And walk around second mission
Okay now you're building structures and they
Add little bits and pieces at a time
Into this so the campaign is really cool
The way it's developed
Multiplayer
Not so noob friendly
I mean they've done some things
There's this whole practice league you can do
For a little while you can slow down the game
A lot I mean there are some things they've done
To help it be a little bit easier but
You know at the end of the day when you try to play
A human opponent it's it's it's tough
And
Playing though against like the computer AI
Depending on how you do it is
Is cool like you know
A friend of mine from the WoW guild and I were playing
Online the other night and we were playing
Two versus two but we would slow down
The game and we played very
Easy computer and it was almost too easy
Like we whooped it like three times so we
Said let's step it up to easy
And still we were able to conquer it
You know a little more difficult but not not too bad
So but then we played
Like instead of a custom game
We actually played the regular co-op
Mode that was like I don't know
Some different mode where you couldn't change
The speed so the speed was
Fast and we got annihilated
We got zerg literally
By because both computer opponents
Happened to be zerg and we just got slaughtered
And it was really hard so
As long as I can play the game slow
I'm good and then or getting better
I should say and I know the
Speed thing will come with time but
Yeah so multiplayer has been a very interesting
Experience but campaign is really cool
You know very animated very cool
Little like decks that you go through on the ship
To kind of well you're not
You don't start there you actually start in a
Different area but you move on to the ship
And you can kind of buy enhancements
And things which are really cool
So I like what they did there
Where things get weird I think with starcraft
Is that they made this
Decision to put out three starcraft
Games and they're gonna do I think the zerg game
Is coming next and there's gonna be a protoss game
Later on there what all
Within the next year year and a half maybe
I don't remember how far apart these games are supposed to be
But they're all coming out and my question is
You know for 60 bucks
For this game I feel like I got
A pretty good deal there's a really
Well fleshed out multiplayer game
There's a solid single player game in there
I'm a happy camper
But my question is in the next game
Okay there's gonna be
A zerg campaign alright I get that
That'll be cool cause I'll actually get to learn how to play
Zerg cause that's the other
Problem I have with multiplayer right now is that
Being that I am new to starcraft I didn't really
Get into the first game
I don't know what I'm doing when I play
Zerg or protoss I mean yeah I know
They have a lot of the similar stuff but I don't
I don't know it and there's no real easy
Way to learn it so
I guess these other games might be an easy way
For me to learn it but for everybody else
That's super into starcraft
I don't know how they're gonna justify 60 dollars
Just for a zerg campaign
Doesn't seem like
There's gonna be enough there I mean
I'm imagining they'll just have to do a shit ton
Of maps and some other enhancements
To multiplayer here and there
Achievements I don't know but 60 dollars
Is really gonna feel
Like you're not getting the same
Value out of the second game
So you do the first game and maybe
Obviously it's probably a little early for me
To be saying something like that cause I haven't played
The second game but I just kinda look at it
And go what are they gonna add that's gonna
Make it worth all that money cause multiplayer
Is multi you know that's I don't see that changing
A whole lot
I wanna
I think I recall the blizzard developers saying
Last year that when they announced that they were
Doing three separate releases
That the campaigns the story modes for each
Game is gonna be anywhere from
25 to 40 hours whatever is
Considered a full game length
Cause in Starcraft 1
All three campaigns together made up the game
So you're gonna be playing as the Terrans for
30 hours to get their whole story
Zerg for 30 hours to get their whole campaign
So I guess they're really it's more like a trilogy
I guess in one
Sequel but it's still gonna be really hard
After having plopped the money and
Feeling that value from this first
Game when I get that second game
If I don't feel that same value
I'm not gonna be pleased
If you don't care about lore really
And you're just in it for the multiplayer and the maps
Which a lot of people are
30 hours of campaign even if it's like ooh let's
You know go into the heart of the politics of the Zerg
It's like yeah I don't care
That's 30 hours I could be working on my ranking in league mode
Right? Yeah
So it's gonna be very interesting to see how they justify it
I think it's gonna be tough
But you know I don't know Blizzard
Clearly they know what they're doing
They have much success on the PC
You know I'm really excited for Diablo 3
And obviously the new WoW expansion
But at this point
I kind of look at it and go
I don't know if this was the best decision
I mean from a money making perspective
It was but
They might do 60 bucks, 45 bucks, 45 bucks
They might take it down a notch
On the prize for the latter two
I wonder if they're gonna do the other two as expansions
To the first one so you have to buy the first game
Ho ho
Wow
I could see that
If the second and third games were just expansions
To the first game
That I get but that's not the way Blizzard's talking
So I don't know
Alright anyhow
We're gonna get into some gaming news here
Now that we're done with our gaming week
But first some housekeeping
Not a whole lot of housekeeping I want to share tonight actually
Please join our Facebook if you haven't already
Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio is where our Facebook can be found
We're also on Twitter at Twitter.com slash O-L-R
We're gonna be taking your Twitter topics later on
So if you want to send us some of those that'd be great
And of course you can always email us
At mailbag at Orange Launch Radio
Dot com we'll get to reading your emails
A little later in the show
Otherwise not a lot of show
I mean we had last week off I don't see us having another show
Off until
Probably I know Halloween
Is on a Sunday this year right so there probably
Is not gonna be an alarm
I sent you a message about that
You did but I think it was when I was really intoxicated in Reno
That's something to discuss later
Yes how I
Drank so much in Reno that I actually fell out of the bed
Oh no I meant Halloween but
Oh uh
I just made that up
It's really funny huh
Rob fell out of the bed
Alright yeah we'll talk Halloween later
But otherwise we're set for a little while
Alright uh or
I don't know about Labor Day weekend
Because that's gonna be tough cause it's a three day weekend
We'll see
Drunk show?
It's gonna be an idea actually
We haven't done that in a long long time
No we haven't
I doubt Loki would be participating in that
Yeah I don't think I could
Does Dan drink at all? Can Dan drink?
He's not big on it
You know what we should do
We should do the marathon episode of Orange Lounge Radio
Yes
Cause there's nothing on
On All Games Radio after us
And we should just honestly see
And I don't know how the listeners will feel about this
We should do the regular show
And then we just go for it
Go as long as we possibly can
I wonder if there's a Guinness Book of World Records
For the world's longest podcast
We wouldn't hit it
Because I know some of these people
Especially when they do the charity bus
The desert bus
That thing goes on for like a week
But I'm talking about podcast
Even then I don't think we'd hit it in just 24 hours
We'd have to take it two weeks time
We'll add gaming podcast
In front of that
The longest episode of the official gaming podcast
Of the universe
I'm looking at the chatroom
Chat.orangeloungeradio.com
Breakman in our chatroom
Just for the record says falling out of the bed
Is way better than falling off the toilet
Haven't done that
Let's see
The chatroom says ooh drunk show
And of course as always we would drink responsibly
If we do have a drunk show then somebody else
Is gonna have to drive me here
On the vault floor like Jamie's other
Houseguests do
We'll figure that out
Tigerclaw says it'll be like an after birth XXL
Yeah something like that
Sj100matt says we should invite
Irene and Xtopher for this
We definitely should try to get other people here
If we do that
Maybe I'm onto something
I'm not going out of town for Labor Day
I usually do but I'm not this year
That's actually in two weeks
I plan on sitting on my ass
Are you available to come up here?
I was gonna say if you're staying at home
For Labor Day weekend I'm coming up here then
Maybe we'll do that
If people feel like crashing
So we can sleep in cycles
We've got the futile mattresses
In the vault
I can make it into a comfortable little bed
We have comfortable couches
We'll figure something out
That's in two weeks though
I just realized oh crap that's in two weeks
So next week we'll have an answer
On what's gonna happen in two weeks
Alright in the meantime
How about some actual bonafide gaming news
Loki I know you've missed the gaming news
How are you doing?
Doing alright
So there's a rumor going around saying that the brand new
Or I guess the next iteration
Of the PSP will have touch sensitive
Controls on the back of the system
Now this isn't that far fetched
Of an idea because if you've
Seen any of the
Shots of the PSP
On the phone that's supposed to be coming out
It actually has some sort of touch panels
On the front of the unit
I don't understand the back how that's really gonna
Work it seems a little awkward to me
But I guess we'll see
Um
And apparently this is coming from
An unnamed source according
To Eurogamer and
Um
There's not really
Much to go on I guess other than
Saying that um
Apparently the device is gonna
Be roughly the size of the PSP 3000
And um
That looks like there's gonna be plenty
Of room left over for
A physical media slot
On it so
None of this PSP go crap
Cause honestly that didn't sell very well at all
I think they were super flimsy
Yeah
Guess what Sony apparently people do like to buy
Physical copies of their games
Who would have thought
Um
So
I don't know it'd be interesting to see
If this really does anything
I think they really should just stick with
Putting at least a second analog stick on there
Um cause the actual PSP
Phone thing um had
This touch panel that would kind of replace
The analog sticks
And you could kind of use it like the analog sticks
Cause it was almost like a strip
Um which is an interesting idea I guess
But
I don't know
Hopefully the system will do a lot better than the
Last PSP so
I don't think the last PSP oh well the PSP Go
Did terribly yes but the original
You're not talking about the original PSP
I'm talking about the original PSP it's not done well recently
Well compared to the DS but it's done
Better than a lot of systems do
I would think
What other systems are we talking about out there?
The Lynx, the Game Gear, the
Gamescom, the uh
What was that shitty little thing they showed off at E3
A few years ago it was a portable device
The Gizmodo? The Gizmodo
The N-Gage, it's been better than all of those
I like the little
Guitar game on the Gizmodo though
Barely though Gizmondo that was it
Gizmondo
Oh Gizmodo's a gaming block
Or something like that
It's a dumb name for device anyways
Gizmondo
But yeah it's just I don't know
I don't see them doing too much
Stuff that's very different than the last
PSP I think that
The system's okay
They just have to make a few enhancements to it
And hopefully they'll learn from their mistakes
Um
And I hope for their sake that it's a little more
Secure as far as cracking it goes
No
Wait what adds value
To these rumors? Cause rumors
Can you know kinda come from anywhere
Like I could say oh the next PSP is gonna double as a
Cigarette lighter woohoo you know there you go
But uh
Cut, print, run with it
PSP to have cigarette lighter
But what adds this any value
What they're saying here
Um
Honestly don't know
So I guess we don't really know
I mean for all we know this could be
Some sort of
Analyst talking about the system
I don't know
Let's see here
It's um
According to three separate development sources
That have seen the new PSP
And
They're saying that it's gonna
Have a touch sensitive area on the back of the
Unit behind the screen
Which is weird if you think
About it I mean
That's just awkward
I mean if I'm gonna control a game and I'm
Touch screens on the back
Unless it like flips
Over or something so you can do like
Touch screen type games like the DS or something
But
I don't know
Going to our chatroom at chat.orangelandraday.com
Odd1 says I hope they keep the online
Functionality of the device, podcasting
Decent web browsing, shit was
Kind of cash you know and SD cards
Yeah um I kind of agree
PSP's biggest strength wasn't necessarily
The games that were on it but the fact it was kind of an all
In one type of thing I mean minus the phone
But you don't need a phone there
They added their advantage definitely
There but and the games were
Not bad I mean the games were good
It's just for whatever reason
Well I know what the reason is
You know they have rampant piracy
And I'm sure that's affected their
Sales of different games
And because of that now you don't have a lot of games being
Developed for the PSP just because it's not
Doing as well
I don't think it was a
Terrible system at all but
There's a few things that they could have fixed
Like you know the second analog stick would have been
Nice
Definitely think it should have at least two analog sticks
And then as far as the controls
Go I think it's fine maybe add
Some you know an L2 R2
Button you know so it's more like
The Playstation
And that's about it that's all you really need
To do as far as controls go because the controls
You know scheme
Is pretty much the same thing that's on the
Playstation 3 and the Xbox 360
And it works well you don't need to
Add some touch screens to it
Hell if you want to make the screen a touch screen or something
That's fine you know so you can type and stuff
It's a lot easier than you know the
Phone dialing type thing that they had
Going with it
That would be fine if you just
Make the screen a touch screen for that kind of stuff
Because people dig that
And if you want the control scheme you know for
Different like casual games
That would be fine
But I don't think they really need to reinvent
You know the controls for the system
Itself it's pretty good
Alright
Well we'll see what happens I would imagine if there
Was going to be a new PSP probably not going to hear anything
About it until next year's E3
They're saying it's expected to launch
At the end of 2011
Makes sense because you have the 3DS coming out
At the beginning of 2011 so
We'll see what happens maybe it'll do 3D
On top of all that doubt it
We'll see
By the way before I get into my next story I did want to bring
This up because somebody in chat had actually talked about
Let's see it was a little while ago here
But talking about the gaming marathon
Or the marathon we were talking about doing over Labor Day weekend
Tiger Con or chat room says
Seems like a good idea for those of us in the west coast
Or for those in the west coast
But for the east coast it would be enormously late for us
I actually got
A message right after that from
Bobby Blackwolf who does the show
Before us telling us he's actually going to be out
Labor Day weekend so that means
There's going to be no programming on all games radio
At all on Sunday because Dragon Con
Is that same weekend and PAX
So we'd only be going up against PAX
And Dragon Con
Just that?
I think there's a lot of people
Listening to our show though that aren't able to afford
To fly out to Seattle or Atlanta
So I'm sure there'll be an audience
For it if we want to do it
So we'll see
We'll have to see what happens
I have to make sure it's okay that we can
Just hijack the stream for a whole day
But I don't see why not
I think more people would rather hear the talking
Than the music but maybe it's just me
Anyway we'll let you know next week
As we move on talking about some more gaming news
And GoldenEye is happening on
Of course the Wii coming out a little later
This year
Except it's GoldenEye with Daniel Craig
Which is a little weird but you know it is
Somewhat of the same game
That you should know of before
Well what's pretty cool is that when the game comes out
They're going to be releasing a bundle that actually
Comes with a classic controller
So if you want to spend
$70 or $69.99
To be exact
Oh that's right because they have the
What's the difference? The classic controller
It's got the little grippies on it
There's a little bit extra stuff
But also not just the fact that it's pro
But it's gold, get it?
GoldenEye, gold
Golden Wii, Wii is golden
Golden Wii
So if you want to get a golden controller
Well there isn't actually a golden Wii
Just a golden classic controller pro
For your white Wii or your black Wii
Does it tell you to drink more water?
Sorry
Don't lick it
Don't lick the golden Wii
No release date
Announced outside the United States
So if you're in another country you may not be getting this
At all but you know what
Usually it's the other countries that get all those
Games, or not the games
The different colors and things for their systems
Before we do so
You can wait on this one
I don't know it sounds cool I already have a classic controller
Might not be pro with grippy things
I don't think I need a second one
Heck my Wii still isn't even hooked up
Although, shit
Metroid's out
Today?
It's next week
It's not next week, it's the week after next
Or wait, no it is next week
It has to be next week
The intro to that
The little trailer that was up
Is gorgeous
It looks awesome
I'm going to have to dust off the Wii and hook it up again
I think I really want to play that game
So we'll see
It's the first Wii game I've been interested in a very long time
But I did play Goldeneye a little bit at E3
And you know, it's Goldeneye
But I think it's just cashing on
The nostalgia
I don't think there's going to be
A whole lot else this brings to the table
Hey remember Goldeneye?
Hope that Oddjob isn't so much of a cheap bitch
I actually played as Oddjob
And he was an awesomely cheap bitch
Awesome
Dan and I watched this video
That's like the top ten dick moves
To pull in a game
And one of them is playing Oddjob
In deathmatch and Goldeneye
Okay now, I don't remember why
Why is he a cheap bitch?
Because he's short
It's like when he's right up on you
You can't shoot him
You have to aim low to shoot
But the hat toss thing is the best thing ever
It really is
There's a shoe, honestly
When we were in Reno at the hotel
I noticed
That the direct to your room streaming
For video games is N64 games
Which is just so backwards
And weird to me, I don't know why
It's been that way for years
And now what kind of technology
Is that run on? Is that similar to like the
Streaming
The PC games on live
Is that like on live in a hotel?
How does that work?
It's much lower tech than that
It's literally, I think, running a cartridge
Wow
So like too many people can't play it at once?
Since I'm on eBay right now
They do sell those systems sometimes
I don't remember what they're called
But they're really expensive and they have
A bunch of different
N64 games in there
That they can stream
Just while
Logie's looking at that, in our chatroom
At chat.orangelandraday.com, some of the chatters
Are talking about Netflix on the Wii
And a lot of folks using the Wii for Netflix
I'm talking about the LodgeNet Nintendo 64
Yes, wow
That the Wii
Is a good bedroom gaming console
And that a lot of people can get Netflix
In their bedroom with that
You do need a disc for that
There's no Netflix channel at this time
But some folks are kind of talking about that
Looking at a comment from Odd1 in chat asking
Does Goldeneye have online play?
I believe it does
But no voice chat
You just have to double opt in with your
45 digit friend code
Kind of what you're used to in the games
No voice chat, despite the fact we made this
Successory that we don't really use at all
Go Nintendo
Awesome
Alright, so
Going on Dark Sakura, what do you got for us?
Well you know what's better than a Nintendo 64
Lots of things actually
Peanut butter's better than a Nintendo 64
Hey
Mario Kart 64 was
Fucking awesome
Peanut butter is awesome
Dreamcast is pretty awesome
Guess what? They're still making games
I had these coconut M&M's today that were delicious
I had mocha M&M's
They were actually better than a Dreamcast
I have mocha M&M's and they're pretty damn good
I mean you can't lick a Dreamcast
Well you could, but it wouldn't be very tasty
Avoid the warranty on that
Unless you're Jessica Chopra
Anyway
They put out The Last Hope
And Wind and Water Puzzle Battles
And Rush Rush Rally Racing
They're doing more
Dreamcast games, they want to do more
And more, and they're actually trying to see if companies
Will release their games
On the Dreamcast
So they've got
Another release planned for next year
But to supplement
You know, any losses
They've actually, you know, well
To supplement their costs
They'll be reproducing games for WiiWare
And Xbox Live Arcade too
I was going to say, they should talk to Sega since they're going to be doing
Those Dreamcast games on
Live already
Yeah, when?
Soon
They did have Crazy Tax 83
And the guy behind it, he totally wants
Sega to start producing for the
Dreamcast again
Which I kind of think isn't going to happen
What could possibly make you think that?
Maybe because
They've said themselves the Dreamcast is over
Yeah
Also, yeah, who's going to produce new Dreamcast
Hardware? How long is it before the
Patents are up on those things and then all the
Korean and Chinese knockoff
Systems can come out, like the Nintendos
The Patents are up
On the old school Nintendos and you see all these
New Nintendos coming out
That are, you know, they don't have the
Blow on the cartridge problem
Or any of that stuff, I mean it's all kind of different now
I want the Famicom Disk System
Personally
I think there's one out there that plays NES and Genesis games
I want to say I saw
I have something that will do that
I have an NES and I have a Genesis
They have a Genesis one
And I have a PC
The portable Genesis one
I have a portable Genesis, it's called a Nomad
I want to say it's about 20 years, because I have a feeling
The Super Nintendo one is going to lapse really soon
It already has, they have Super Nintendo
systems out there
Do they really?
You know, new
Duo LT's and I'll be happy
But it would be interesting, I mean
Not to deviate too much from the topic at hand
But you know, even if Sega didn't want to do the Dreamcast
Themselves, license
Before the patent lapses
If they're just going to sit on it
Let someone else develop a Dreamcast
I honestly think the Dreamcast games are still pretty solid
You're cut out, for some reason
I think the Dreamcast games are still pretty solid
I mean, I've gone back
And wanted to play stuff up
I've been doing that today, I want to play Sonic Adventure
Because, well, you know
I'm still kind of hot
I'm holding the thing in
I'm telling you, we're not hearing you
Well, I'm still wanting to play
Sonic Colors, when it comes out
So I've been like, let's play Sonic Adventure
So
Alright
Well, we'll see how
Successful this venture is
It was also really easy to pirate Dreamcast games
So we'll have to see how successful this venture is
And hey, even if you couldn't
Get the game to burn right, you'd always get a great soundtrack
True
And they're those games that that company's putting out
They are out there
For piracy reasons
Why am I not surprised?
I just run them on my cabinet at home
Because I have a Dreamcast emulator on there
So, you know, fresh rush rally
Or whatever is pretty awesome, and I don't know where to buy that game
Not that I would anyway
Since it's like 40 bucks
40 bucks for a Dreamcast game, nowadays
No
Anyhow
So it's kind of funny
Apparently, Microsoft got this great idea
Excellent idea, that they're going to
Digitally distribute
Review copies of
Halo Reach to the press
Or press people
Or whomever they have that they're distributing this to
And it's available
In a games on demand format
Through live
In fact, some people found it actually
On the
Marketplace for
99,999
Microsoft points
Which is just, you know, it's just
That's not showing up on the console, right?
That's some website trick
Actually showing up on the website
And, you know, obviously
Even if you did have the
$1250
To purchase the game, it would let you
Purchase the game
Unfortunately though
Even though it did
Come up on there
Someone found a way to download it
And then people found a way
To crack it
And now it's leaked out there
Thanks to Microsoft
Which is ironic because this is probably
Why they did this in the first place
They probably switched to digital distribution
To avoid the piracy of the discs
And what happened was this
Game site, I think
GameTutorial.com
They
Originally downloaded it
And then they're like, haha, we have it
We're not going to share it with anybody
And somehow their copy leaked out to
Somebody else that was less scrupulous
Than they were and sent it out to the
Community and everybody figured out how to crack it
Like immediately
That website got it legitimately?
No, they found a way to hack the
Live server
To download it without actually having to have the code
And stuff
They did that
And
Yeah, so it's not
Too good for Microsoft
And of course they're investigating
How people were able to
Get this
Once it's on the internet, it's out there
That's a really bad one to lose
I'm surprised that
They didn't test this
On not so much of a triple A title
They tested it on
They did it with Crackdown 2 apparently
It's on there like that
But it didn't matter with Crackdown 2
Because that got leaked out a week or two before
It was actually released
This has been leaked out
Three weeks before
It comes out
The format that they've broken down to now
Games on Demand packages
Are basically how you install
A game onto your hard drive
It's that format
Or if you download it from their service
It's the same format but you're just downloading it
Consoles out there that are
Hacked with JTAG
Basically they can run
Pretty much anything
There's a program out there to convert
The games on demand packages to ISO
Or like a disk format
And then you just dump all the files on there
So that's what they basically did
After they cracked
The file that was on there
Monty Boggs in our chat
says
Bungie will ban hammer
That's actually kind of an interesting point
Because this is all being done digitally
And these copies are signed
Isn't there a way that Microsoft could
Ban hammer all the consoles that have this?
Well, yes and no
Because yes they could ban them
If they were dumb enough to take them online
But these are being
These copies that are out there right now
Are used on JTAG systems
Which are not used for online play
JTAG systems would get banned anyways
If you connected to Live after about four hours or so
You would get your console banned
So these systems are just meant for playing
See what they're doing now
Is to play online
Is they're using tunneling services
To use system like over the internet
To play other people
So that's how they're getting around it
So they don't care that they can't connect to Live
Oh they use like a warp pipe style thing
Yes exactly
So they're using tunneling services
To basically play online
And stuff like that
And also they're not really missing out on anything
If there's download content
Is this why we see less and less games supporting System Link?
My mind goes to Starcraft 2 and the LAN thing
Well the LAN thing
That's something different
I think the reason why consoles don't use System Link nowadays
Is because the games are so sophisticated
That they have trouble running them as a server
And also running the game
At the same time
It's not easy for them to do it
They have to program it
Efficiently enough to where they can do that
Like I wish Grant had thought it was System Link
Because
We would still be playing our mod game
Because we wouldn't have to update anything
So we could have been doing that
But we had to play over Live
Red Dead Redemption was System Link
And that's awesome because our internet connection at work sucks
And so a lot of times we get disconnected from Live
So System Link is definitely the way to go
And also we used to play Saints Row 2
Which was a good backup game
If our Live ever went down
We would just play a System Link game of that
And of course
Call of Duty and Halo
Is always supported System Link
Because of the LAN play and stuff like that
So they're not going to just take it out
Because of piracy
But yeah it kind of sucks
They tried to bypass it
But unfortunately there's no way around it
But the minute you try to take a
Hacked version of the game
Or a pirated version of the game online
You're going to get banned
If they play it on your
Say you have an account that you would use
On a JTAG system and on a Live system
If it shows that you're playing the game
Before the release like that
They're going to probably ban you anyways
Or at least flag you and watch what you do
So obviously if you're going to play the game
You don't play it on your account that you use on Live
But
I don't know
Alright
But yeah it's tragic
But that sort of thing happens
What's also funny though
Actually kind of tying in with the hacking stuff
There was a USB
Mod chip
Announced actually for the Playstation 3
That's going to be released next week
And apparently
This chip kind of works like
I guess
A tool that they have for
Actual Playstation repair
And stuff like that it puts the system into a developers mode
Where you can run on signed code
And apparently
This chip or whatever
The USB card
Can be updated
You can update the firmware on it
So they can never really be locked out from the system
And also it's going to be able
You're going to be able to dump games to your hard drive
And run them straight off your hard drive
Like you could with the Playstation 2 HD loader
And stuff like that
That's something that will be interesting
It's called the PS Jailbreak
Even though I don't really think it's a jailbreak
But that will be coming out
Next week which will be interesting
Now what about I saw this story on some websites
And the story said
Well we don't know what's going on
Because they're just showing this running on a debug system
Which is
They're showing a feature that isn't new for a debug system
Well that was that one video
That was from
I don't remember if it was osmodchips.com
Or something like that
It's one of the stores that's selling them
Online they were showing it running on their debug system
But the thing is
The company or whomever that made these chips
Send it out to a bunch of different sites
To review and test out
And stuff like that
And there were other people that do not have
Debug systems that were running it and doing the same thing
Can't Sony patch this out
In minutes?
No because it's the same tool that they use to fix
Their consoles so
They can't really patch it out because it would fuck up
I think developer consoles or something like that
Or if they did
Basically what they would have to do
Is ban a certain
USB ID or something like that
So that it would detect
Okay this is this card
So we're going to make it so that
You can't run this anymore
But all they can do is they update the firmware
On that card and they can change that ID
Or whatever
So I don't
They say that there's no way to ban it
And I'd be willing to bet though that
I mean they may patch it
And they may fix it again
With the PSP or the DS or the Wii
Or anything
They put out patches to fix things
And fix loopholes
But it may be too hard
And on the other thing too
What this is supposed to do is
It will also disable forced updates
Forced system updates
So for example
Newer software that comes out has the newer system versions
And stuff like that
And you can actually disable it from updating your system
So if you're playing offline
I don't know
It would be interesting to watch
Because now the one console system
That was the most secure
Has now been cracked wide open
It would be interesting to see
Vidpower in our chatroom says
What is with the term jailbreaking
Being used for everything that involves hacking?
You know the iPhones use that term too
I don't know
It's a clever term
And it caught on
It's a buzzword
It's trendy
It kind of makes sense for the iPhone
But it's trendy so everyone wants to use it now
I'm thinking about jailbreaking my phone
Just so I can downgrade the stupid OS
I hate iOS 4 on a 3G
Supposedly there's a patch coming
But we've been waiting what
Two months?
Actually I just updated the patch
On my 3GS
And I've noticed it running a little bit better
3GS's are different though
I know but I'm saying
It could have included some fixes
I'm not going to hold my breath
But I will get excited about this
I'm very excited about this announcement
Well of sorts
It's about the game Torchlight
Which is a little kind of PC
I don't know if you want to say indie game
It's by Runic Games which is made up
Of a lot of people who were with Blizzard
At one time or what have you
But it's a cool game one way or the other
If you like Diablo 2 this is a great kind of holdover
While you wait for Diablo 3
Torchlight
Originally they wanted to put Torchlight on Xbox Live Arcade
But they actually
I guess kind of held off for whatever reason
Didn't end up doing it
But now they're apparently putting serious effort
Into actually making a console version of Torchlight
And it was announced at Gamescom
By the Runic CEO Max Schaeffer
Quote, we're trying
We're talking to Sony and Microsoft
And we hope to get that done quickly
And they want to have it available by the holidays
Just so you know this game
Has actually already moved about 750,000 units
So it's already almost sold close to a million
Which isn't bad for a game like this
That's been mostly digital distribution
I know I got it on one of those crazy
Steam sales
And I'm sure a lot of you guys did
As well
Get it that way
Piracy apparently has been an issue with this game
Unfortunately
So they can't track how many illegal copies are going on out there
But seeing as Torchlight 2
Is going to be multiplayer
Especially if this does go to Xbox Live and so forth
They'll have that to think about
They'll be able to track that a little better
There's also a Torchlight MMO
Happening at some point
So we'll see
It'll be interesting though if Torchlight goes to Xbox Live
And PSN because it's only single player
One of its biggest drawbacks is there isn't really multiplayer in it
That's why they're doing Torchlight 2
And a lot of the games on
Xbox Live Arcade and Playstation Network
Really thrive on a multiplayer environment
Not all of them, like what, Mega Man 9
Is it really multiplayer?
There's other stuff out there that doesn't
Have to be multiplayer
But uh
It'll be very cool to have a Diablo style game
On Xbox Live I think
I don't know, what do you think? You're a fan of Torchlight, right Alan?
What do you think of this game moving to the
Consoles?
Whatever will help it get a larger audience
So that when, if the MMO
When it does come out
It'll succeed, then I'm all for it
Alright
Let's move on to some more gaming news
Then we'll get to some release dates, StarkSakra
Well
You know how some places
Have these archaic laws on the books
Like, in Alabama it's illegal
To walk around with an ice cream cone in your back pocket
Did you know that?
Now I wanna go and just do it
I don't know if you can walk around with an ice cream cone in your back pocket
With a crunch
It's possible, but it gets soggy
Well, the city of Beacon, New York
Has one that says
That there can't be pinball
Tables, they're illegal there
And now they're enforcing it
They've shut down
A retro arcade
You cut out for a minute
They shut down a retro arcade
Didn't pinball
Used to be associated with gambling
In the mafia and things like that
Years and years ago, so maybe that's where the law came from
And, you know, them darn kids
Um, the mayor of Beacon
You might have to switch mics
The mayor of Beacon said it was
Is this better?
Yes
Okay, they said it was about noise
That people complained about the noise
And blah blah blah blah blah
And so they said
Well, we'll just use this law
As a convenient excuse to enforce
The noise thing
Which is bull
I mean, seriously?
I know, I would actually like to see
What other businesses are around the people
That supposedly complained
So
You know, I think it was on CNN
Or one of the news channels
They were actually showing this place
And it actually looked kind of cool
And I'm thinking, like, I've never heard of this town
Until this happened, but
There was this place there that I thought
I might want to visit someday
But now I guess I can't
It's kind of a bummer
Because this place is somewhat unique
And I bet they would have had visitors
I don't know how far it is from New York City
But I bet there would have been folks in that
New York area that might take a trip out
To upstate someday to go take a look at it
But obviously they can't now
They're shooting themselves in the foot
And the guy's saying
We tried to help them save their business
And find them other locations
And use decibel tests to be objective
And blah blah blah
It's just crap
The loudest thing that happens
When I play pinball is when
I miss and I go, God damn it
And I'm just yelling
At the table
Do you think maybe that's what happened there?
Was just an outbreak of people saying, God damn it, shit
You know, if they had good carpeting
It would have totally muted the noise
There used to be
There was a little tiny arcade
Out in Roseville called Supercade
Years and years ago, run by this old gentleman
That sadly he got put out of business
He was in the middle of a strip mall
He had tons of pinball games and arcade games
And he never
Got noise complaints
Or what have you
There's people that own retro arcade tables
And have them out in the Galleria
In a hallway
So in the Danos
Interesting
Alright, well let's start to travel the world
And take a look at some release dates
And hopefully these games will not be banned
In your local city
Yes, not a whole lot
Coming out this week
But there's some pretty good stuff
Let's just start with the stuff
Not necessarily the good stuff
Martian Panic
From Zoo Games
It's a generic arcade shooter game
Available with a neon green
Shotgun, or by itself
Those of course on the Wii
Nancy Drew, Secrets Can Kill 2010
Coming out on PC
Umm...
Elemental War of Magic
On PC as well from
Stardock
Oh god, I forgot this was coming out
Because
Someone thought it was a great idea to put
Grease the musical
Or like the sing-along version of it
I guess, in theaters
There's Grease the video game
Coming out on Wii and DS
Where you can sing and dance with the
Casts of Grease
In opportunity form
Fun
This is pretty cool
Gunblade NYC
And L.A. Machine Guns
A game I seriously played tons of
Back in the Qsar days
Coming to the Wii as well
For a wonderful $30 retail price
Just like that House of the Dead 2 and 3 collection
It should be pretty fun
Gotta go back and play Ghost Squad some more
That's some fun stuff
Umm...
Dead Edition will also be coming out this week as well
Umm...
Mafia 2 on Playstation 3
And Xbox 360
And PC this week
Umm...
That game from 2K
Harvest Moon Grand Bazaar on DS this week
Here's a game for Rob
Hello Kitty Online
Coming out on PC this week
Yay! Wait, I thought this had been out for a while
Well, apparently it's the disc version
Of the game
It's just digital before you
NHL 2K11 on the Wii
Coming out this week
Ivy the Kiwi
On DS and Wii this week
The Bachelor
The video game
Okay, wait, you've said that game like three times
It's been delayed a ton of times, okay
I wonder why
Because it's a terrible, terrible game
I think they just want you to keep announcing it every week
So they keep delaying it one week at a time
You know that they are putting out an amazing race game
When I was in Reno, I played an amazing race slot machine
That was actually really cool
It was like a high budget thing
It had a huge subwoofer in it
It had Phil
That's all you need
It was a nice slot machine
And the one at Calneva
I won a ton of money on
Well, not a ton, for pennies I won a ton of money
But the one at Eldorado ripped me off
So just a word to the wise
That go to Reno to do their gaming
Go play at Calneva because their slots are looser
Yeah, The Bachelor video game
Eventually is going to come out at some point
Then making way for probably more crappier games
Oh, actually I know it's making way for more crappier games
Like Survivor and Minute to Win It
And
Pretty much any game show that's on TV now
Is going to have a game based on it
And it's going to be on the Wii
Because that's what they do
Battlefield Bad Company 2
The Ultimate Edition
A re-release with a bunch of download content
And fun download content for
Battlefield 1943
As well
Or 1942, I don't remember which game it is
Anyways, that's on
PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360
Ghost Pirate of Vuju Island
On PC, some value game there
From Disney
Guilty Party
Kind of like a clue type of game
That's on the Wii
Yeah, we talked about that a little while ago
This time it's actually coming out
Camp Rock the Final Jam on DS
A new movie
Ace Combat Joint Assault on PSP
Valkria Chronicles 2
On PSP as well
Game called Cosmo's Chaos on the DS
Of course, the big one this week
Metroid Other M, coming out on the Wii
And
And I believe that's it
Oh, no, there's a couple other crappier games here
At the very end
Valkria on the DS, my first dollhouse on the DS
And Prison Tycoon in Alcatraz on PC
Prison Tycoon in Alcatraz, wow

More comments from the chat room
Brakeman in our chat says
Yay, amazing race! Wait, what's the amazing race?
It's a TV show
Here
I thought they had it in other countries, maybe not
But it's like teams of two that go around the world
And it literally is a race
They pick up clues
It's like, I don't want to say a scavenger hunt
What's the other kind of game?
Isn't there a game that people
can play where you go from point A to point B
and pick up clues along the way? I don't know what the name for that is
But that's the reason why it is
You do tasks at every
point in every city and you move on and the winner gets a million bucks
It's a show
And let's see
Chat.orangewonnagevideo.com more comments
Where's the mole game? asks Frisbee
Excellent question
That was the best reality show they ever did
Monty Boggs says, how come Big Brother Wii
doesn't sound appealing to me?
Because you're not trashy
They still may do that
If the Survivor game sells, why not?
They had, was it
America's Top...
Do they have America's Top Model?
They had America's Top Model
What other
crappy games did they have?
Wipeout
They had a thing for that
I get Minute to Win it because they're just going to do
Wii versions of all those stupid games
they play on that show
Let's go to Target, the game
and buy paper cups and ping pong balls
and pay somebody a million dollars
to do the tricks
I'm surprised they don't have a home game yet
I believe it's coming out
if it's not already out
It's not hard to do
a home version of Minute to Win it
Go to the dollar store
Exactly, dollar store the game
SSG100Matt says
Robin Allen should be on The Amazing Race
I'm a Robin Jamie
Actually, I don't know how Allen feels about being on Network TV
like The Amazing Race, but I gotta say, me and my friend Victoria
have been talking about it for at least two years
how badly we need to go on The Amazing Race
I don't drive, and there's usually
you know, you have to get into
a jeep and one person does something
while the other person drives
and I couldn't do that
My favorite task I ever saw on The Amazing Race
was when they were in Thailand
and they had to get in these taxis
but they're karaoke taxis
Thai karaoke songs from point A to point B
or whatever, but they were actually
singing with women
in the back seat, but they were actually female
impersonators, and some of the teams
didn't even catch on to it
that they were singing with
Taiwan Asian female impersonators
Was there like a bro team
asking for their number?
You know there was, they showed it on TV
but the challenge cracked me up
I do free Xenocord
they do need a supermarket sweep game
I thought there was one
a while ago, a supermarket sweep game
like on PC or something
I love that game
watching that on, what was it, Lifetime?
Also, Press Your Luck
there is a Press Your Luck game on Wii
and I think there's another one coming out this year too
Yeah, there's Press Your Luck, A Price is Right
There's a new Wheel of Fortune game
New Jeopardy
A lot of those game shows
are actually out
I don't know how good they are
I seem to remember
X-Link called into the show some time ago
and he's told me about it since then
that the Press Your Luck game is surprisingly not bad
I mean, you get what you pay for
Right? I mean, if you buy a
Press Your Luck game, you know exactly what game
you're buying
It's not a big surprise
Is it responsive?
Do the questions repeat after
playing it three times?
That's all you really need, right?
You know what you're buying when you buy the Press Your Luck home game
Alright, let's get to the Japanese release dates
Enough about game shows. I could talk all day about game shows
I love game shows
In fact, I would love to see
the Sherri Shepherd version of the Newlywed game
because you know she's going to make a great house
Comment about the American X-Top Model game
Didn't sell well because no matter
what you did, Tyra got a better score
than you and then she yelled at you
So that didn't sell well
So here's a question though
What would happen if you had Tyra play
the America's Top Model game?
Now would it go into an infinite loop like
the Tic Tac Show game in WarGames?
If she still had her show
she would have used this opportunity to see
Now me, and here's my game
I had so much fun recording this
I had so much fun doing my game
The Tyra show really was the Tyra show
It was about Tyra
She could be doing a whole show on anorexia
and bulimia and one time she'd be like
I remember this one time when I was at a restaurant
and I didn't want to eat what was in front of me
and I found that to be so hard
I cried that I had the salad
and it was very devastating to me emotionally
Let's go to Japanese release dates
Kane & Lynch 2 Dog Days
comes out on the 26th on the
Xbox 360 hip hip hooray
That is a Japanese release
so I don't know if they fully localized it
or what but that is coming out
They're actually played by dogs now
Now that I'd buy
That would make the Kane & Lynch series like
ten times better
if it was a gritty crime drama
with canines, dogs
Hold down R2 to scoot your butt
Alright, on the PlayStation 3
Kane & Lynch 2 Dog Days
is also coming out over there
No word if you can press R3 to poop
Agarest Zenkei Zero
compile heart selection
comes out as well
I'm imagining it's some type of compilation
It's the record of the Agarest Wars
or at least maybe a sequel to it
the one where you can breed
It is a prelude to Agarest Zenki
so it is actually a prequel
You have to breed to create the new game
That has something in common
with a dog game then
Let's see, moving to
Man, and ten dogs
would be so much cooler if they gave
the dogs guns
Don't you think?
They have a game like that
This got brought up
at my work the other day too
It would be even cooler if dogs had guns
on their back
Yeah, but they've done that
It's Metal Max
or something?
Sega was what came out over here
They have dogs
with artillery cannons on their back
Ridiculous stuff
It's awesome
Coming out on the Wii in Japan
I talked about this last week
It's coming out on the 26th
Twinkle Queen comes out on
the Nintendo Wii
What kind of game do you think Twinkle Queen is, Alan?
I don't know, but I'm still waiting for my royalty check
I think it's Twinkle Star Sprites
It is
Here's the description
So is Carmen Sandiego coming back?
I don't think it's those types of PC games
I don't think of Laidback and
Tea Drinker as the same
I think of tight-assed
and ramrod straight
back Tea Drinker
being proper
Character themes and other background music will be imported from the
originals and rearranged for Twinkle Queen
A maximum of four players
can play the game at a time
So I love it, it's PC games
but it's coming out on the Wii
I'm looking at the screenshots and I don't see Carmen Sandiego
but I do see a lot of
scantily clad women
from Katamari Damacy
She's there
I think it would be laid back if your tea was laced with something
Isn't that the Queen from Katamari Damacy?
Yes it is
Is this a Romco Bandai game?
No, it's from Milestone
Maybe they licensed it or something
I swear that looks like the Queen from Katamari Damacy
No, she's wearing a kimono
So is it a fighting game?
It's probably something behind her head
Interesting
Oh well
Chicks beating each other up
We haven't seen that before
Actually we have
Nah, it's a joke
We've seen it tons of times
That's why I'm joking
Alright, anyhow, moving on to the handhelds
There's nothing on PlayStation 2
just so you know
On the Sony PSP
Ace Combat
Joint Assault
Hakioki Zusoruku
Portable comes out this week
from Idea Factory
I don't know what this game is
This is an adventure game
that
I don't know
This chick's cuddling with her blanket
in one of the cutscenes
Looks very dating sim
This looks like a girl dating sim game
Aren't these all boys trying to be her suitor?
Maybe that's what it is
Suitor, sperm donor
We got the bachelor here
We got that there
Monhoniki
Poka Poka Ailoumura
That's what she's hoping for
That's coming out from Capcom
I'm trying to see what game
it is, if it's something we would know here
You guys recognize this game?
They look like the characters from Animal Crossing
Don't they?
This is like a PSP version of Animal Crossing
No it's not
It's the little
I think ascii cat people
They kind of look like Doraemon
A little bit
They have ears
Interesting
Quickly on the DS
Sorry I'm taking a long time here
On the Nintendo DS
Nothing really notable
that comes out this week
Unfortunately
So there you go
Those are your Japanese release dates
Let's go to jolly old England
and talk about their releases
On the 24th we have Grease for Wii and DS
On the 24th we also have Gunblade New York
and L.A. Machine Guns Arcade
I'm a big fan of Gunblade New York
for the record
We also have Ivy the Kiwi
It's got a question mark at the end
So it's Ivy the Kiwi
It's coming out here
You have cut out yet again
Live radio folks
We have Ivy the Kiwi
Kiwi
Shank
Game vs. the World
and Shank again on Xbox 360
On the 27th we have Mafia 2
for PC, PS3, and 360
Alright
That's it
A few more news stories for you guys
in the classic game of the week
Sony has been ordered to pay 5 million yen
to a former Sony employee
who is named
Looks like
Hiro Kume
and he invented
I guess a small optical pickup
that was used to read and write discs
in the Playstation 2 and the original Playstation
Of course he felt that
Sony didn't recognize his contributions
and he took them to court
and he won
So that's not bad
and it roughly translates to
about $60,000
is what he won
and he says
I thank the court for identifying
some of my contributions to the company
but the company should have appreciated
my contributions when I was an employee
Ouch
Scathing a little bit
Speaking of lawsuits
This guy
Craig Smallwood apparently is his name
sued the makers of Lineage
He wants
basically them to fess up to the fact
that their game is too damn addicting
in so many words
that Lineage 2 specifically is so addicting
that he is quote
unable to function independently in usual daily activities
such as getting up, getting undressed,
bathing or communicating with family and friends
Apparently he played the game
for 20,000 hours
between 2004 and 2009
That's like literally
half of every single day
playing Lineage 2
Hmm
Apparently it's negligence
and gross negligence there
I think Bobby was talking about this story on his show too
and he found through some other resources I guess
that the guy was actually running a gold farming service
in this game
because you'll notice
he played for 20,000 hours between 2004 and 2009
Doesn't really point out why he stopped
So is he really addicted to the game
or is he just a jilted gold farmer?
I don't know
It seems like a combination of
I don't know, OCD
that could be a legitimate situation that he was in
but also he had
I guess from when we were listening to
Bobby Blackwolf's show
he had three accounts that he was using to gold farm
Maybe he realized that his return on investment
was so much better the more
hours he logged into each of his three accounts
and that's what got him
addicted
I have to play 12 hours a day
because then I'll make $100 this week
and uh
that could be it
Well let's just assume that wasn't
even all a factor
and that's off the table for a minute here
We're just talking about somebody suing
the makers of the game they've become addicted to
because their game is too addicting
I mean, really? Does that mean I can sue
McDonald's because I'm addicted to Chicken McNuggets
and they made me fat?
They've tried, people have tried
Really? What a country
I know, it's ridiculous
The whole thing is coming down to lack of self control
You know, I love Star Trek Online
You know how much I love the damn game
Guess who doesn't stay logged into it
for more than two hours at a time
That would be me
Even if my friends in the UK are on
I log off
As much as I love talking to them
You know, when I was playing
Ragnarok
Maybe I would leave it on to vend
But I would walk away from my computer
You know
It's addiction
Well not really addiction
There's no
Now the only thing that I could remotely say
of physical effect is
This is getting into a little bit
of chemical psychology
Is what stimulates the pleasure centers of the brain
And that does become addicting
You know, for example
Love has the same effect
in the brain that cocaine can
You know
And that's the only way
I can see any kind of addiction
possibly forming
But that's where the self control
comes in
It may be hard
But you have to take some time for yourself
Get away from the game
I don't know what Lineage 2 has in place
It's not a game I've played
I played it at E3 a few years ago
And have a can of coke in my vault
Oh
Was that the game that gave away the soda?
This was years ago
I think I remember it now
It wasn't a bad game
It's way more popular
in Asia than it is here
Way more popular
Wow is the US game
Lineage and Lineage 2 are twice that
what it is here
I recognize the
art style on this can
The character creation
Lineage is a huge game over there
I believe this gentleman lives in Hawaii
So Hawaii gets
a little bit of a blending of both cultures
a lot of times
Lineage probably has a pretty good fan base
Certainly has its players
here in the continental US too
I don't know
It's just a lot of other
games I've played
Like WoW
I joke that I'm addicted to WoW
But at the end of the day, for instance
Alan and I went to Reno this weekend
And we walked away
Believe it or not, we're okay
We're gonna run our daily the minute we get home
But we're okay
There have been times in WoW where it's like
maybe midnight, 1am
Daily, rep, whatever, BS
And I'm not tired yet
But I'm just on my mount
doing laps around Dalaran
And I'm not really playing
I'm like, what am I doing right now?
I'm in WoW
I have nothing to do
I should just log off
And I've had moments where I just have to make myself sign off
And you're not even chatting?
Because I've done that, but it's because I'm chatting with people
Like I'll be running laps in Dalaran, but I'm also chatting
Well I'll be reading Trade or whatever
There's nothing morally redeeming about Trade Chat
Yeah, it's like 4chan, but in WoW
Pretty much
But WoW, when you log in
Well, I don't remember if WoW has it when you log in
But at least I know some of the tip screens say
Some of the loading screens will say
Remember to take everything in moderation
Including Warcraft
Final Fantasy XI had a disclaimer
You had to click every time
Don't forget your friends, family, or work
You know, this whole little spiel
Every two or three hours?
No, every time you logged into the game you had to click it
Yeah, I remember that
But I mean
It really does come back
You know, and this
I can be on AIM and get caught up in a conversation with somebody
That's one thing
You know, I could be
Online reading news articles
And get caught up in reading
Or I do it with Wikipedia all the damn time
But the whole thing is
To catch yourself
To make reminders
When you notice the time
Then
Oh crap, I've gone on too long
You know, I'll have to check this later
I don't really think
I think that maybe going like
An hour or two over
When you decided that you wanted to stop
That's kind of understandable
Getting caught up is human nature
But to make a habit of it
And to
Play to the exclusion of all else
That's when it gets unhealthy
Well, again
I don't know if he's going to be very
Successful suing the makers of the game
Because he couldn't control himself
I just think it would set a horrific precedence
You know, we could sue anything
That had a negative effect on us
I mean, it's just
You have to have some self control
It's just kind of sad that the judge wouldn't throw it out
But nope, the judge actually
Is allowing the case to proceed
That should be interesting
You know why I would think it would be a good idea
To let a case like that proceed?
So he's struck down
Setting legal precedence
I can see that
Let's see, XenaCorner in our chatroom at chat.orangelandraday.com
Says Lineage 2 is an unreal engine converted
Grinding piece of shit
Or POS, I'm assuming meaning piece of shit
Tigerclaw says
You know, Starcraft 2 can be quite addicting
The other night I was playing it late at night
And by the time I stopped it was like 5am in the morning
Yeah, well a lot of video games
I mean, Starcraft I've heard of tons of addictions
Addictions of varying degrees
Stories of that
But I'm sure there's lots of video games
Even Jamie has talked about
When you were in high school or college
You stayed out for a week to play
And granted, I did have the flu
Legitimately
But all I did was play Final Fantasy
It was Final Fantasy 3
6 over in Japan
That's the only game I've ever
You know, played
While I was that sick
You know, when I had my surgery
I played tons of Blue Dragon last time
I didn't play any games this time because my hand
Heard a different way
But I played a ton of Blue Dragon last time
You know
Big deal
I wouldn't
I played a lot of Final Fantasy 7 when I was supposed to be in college
I'd skip class from time to time
To watch Sailor Moon or play Toushinden
I mean
And when my friend
Had his
He had a Saturn before everybody else because he imported it
And I stayed up all night playing
The damn Gundam game
And King of Fighters
But that's one time
You know
Alright
Well speaking of addicting games
I think it's time for us to take a trip down memory lane
And look at some of the games of the past
And that's in a segment we call
The Classic Game of the Week
Dark Sakura is picked as an addicting game
But it's certainly one she thinks
Kicks ass
It's the Classic Game of the Week
Dark Sakura, what should the kids be worshipping this week?
The game is called Wrecka
And this game was made
For the Summer Carnival in 1992
It's a very limited
Printing of it
But it's amazing for an S game
This isn't some music
You see it's got a pretty rad soundtrack
For an S game
All I hear are the bullets
I've got the soundtrack to this
But now the game itself
Is probably one of the
I would say earlier
Games that could be considered
Bullet hell
Really I think it could be
I mean you see who in the chat room got
Freaking excited with one of our
Bullet hell fans
But
Wrecka is
Pretty damn hardcore
I mean we've got ROMs of it
You can actually buy
Let me get this site again
I think it was
Wreckaness
You can buy reproduction
Cartridges
To play on US systems
Which is pretty cool
But the game
What makes it really special is that
It is
One of the
Highest
Sprite counts
In a game at a fast pace
And you can see
While it's playing on there
It's not really so much of a flicker
It's playing pretty smoothly
On the actual system
I'm seeing some flicker but it seems like they do some tricks
With the way the bullets fly out and things
I don't know if that's just the frame rate
In a conversion to YouTube or what
But it seems like they do some
It looks really amazing the frame rate
For a NES game
On the YouTube it's blazing fast
I'm really impressed by this
It really does play that fast
The game itself
Was published by
Naxastsoft
N-A-X-A-T
In 1992 like I said for the summer
Carnival
It is a side scroller
It has
Bottom to top
Scrolling
You get all kinds
Of power ups
Modifiable power ups
The ones you wait for them to change
Or you can shoot them and they'll change
This particular stage that we're watching
This is just the second level
You go up through this tube
And then you go backwards down the tube
That's kind of rad I like that
Yeah
And the soundtrack for it
Is freaking amazing
The other
Things that you have with this too
Is that instead of having bombs
That when you stop shooting
You can build up a power surge
And deflect
Incoming fire
And then if you charge it long time
It'll clear the screen
The way a bomb would do
Um
It's really hard to do that though
Because as you can see how fast the enemies come at you
And look at the effects in the background
I mean that's very
Looks almost mode 7-ish
I should say
And this was before there was such a thing as mode 7
It has a normal
Score attack and time attack
It's single player only
Um
The game is cool
You've got five primary weapons
And then five optional weapons
Um so you get different power ups
And you can shoot different ways
It's just really really amazing
But this isn't one of the typical story
Oh you have to fight off the aliens
Blah blah save the earth
And
I think that Wrecka is just a freaking cool name
For uh
For a game that needs blazing fire
But the official name is
World Consumer Series Summer Carnival
92 Wrecka
And good luck freaking finding it
I just even love that idea of flying
Up the tunnel and then flying back down
Like you just don't see that in a lot of shooters
At least that I can think of
Usually in fact shooters are almost always
Ship is on the bottom and you're moving
Your way up
Or you rarely ever see it the other way
Rarely ever see it the other way
Around where you're flying at the top of the screen
Moving down
You know the only other game that I've seen some kind of innovation
For the standard side scrolling shooter
Was that same Gundam game that was on the Saturn
Back in the day when it came out
Because you had um three planes
You were in the middle ground
But you had foreground and background
Enemies to fight too
And now this here is stationary
Not just that as a non-standard shooter
But I always think of of course this game
We never talk enough about it here on Orange Knows Radio
One of the most underrated NES games they ever made
Was half shooter and a decent shooter at that
And then half Zelda-ish game
In fact if we do end up doing our little labor day marathon
I think we should just play the shit out of that game
And beat it
Dude I'm all for it
But yeah see that right there
Is the example of the charging move
That's a pretty sweet game for an NES game
It's just it's super rare
And that's why
Those reproduction cartridges are out
I'm actually considering
Getting one
It's supposed to be um
Let me see how much they're selling it for
On the website
I believe that if you pay
$58
That's on check or money order
Standard delivery you get
The gray cartridge
A reproduction box and a manual
It's done in our chatroom as saying that
Legend consumer series only applies to the soundtrack
It's just Summer Carnival 92 Wrecka
Well the soundtrack
Cut out
What?
The soundtrack is worth having
I found it actually to download somewhere
So
Speaking of the soundtrack go get it
The music is really sweet
Alright there it is your classic game of the week
Wrecka
Or if you want Summer Carnival 92 Wrecka
For the Nintendo Entertainment System
Good luck finding that although it does sound like you get
The reproduced cartridges
If nothing else
Somebody get me one
That's gonna do it for part A here at Orange Lounge Radio
But we're not done yet we got more news coming up in part B
We're gonna talk a little bit about Rock Band 3
Talk a little bit about Dance Central
Lots of music game news
We're gonna talk about a new drawing tablet on the Wii
Talk of course a little bit about Doctor Who
And more hacking news
And also ways to cut the lines
At PAX
We'll be interested to see what the chatters think about this story
We're gonna be getting to this
Your emails, your twitter topics and much more
Your phone calls when we come back here at the show
Where every gamer has a voice
Orange Lounge Radio
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio
We are live on this Sunday evening
August the 22nd of 2010
Where we are taping live
The 378th episode of our show
Yeah
It's been about 8 and a half years
So there you go
Lots of news coming at you here in part B
We're gonna get into that in a minute
Your twitter topics here just a few minutes away
Thought we could talk a little more about Reno
And some of the fun experiences we had up there
There's actually some interesting arcades up there
Did anything in the arcades catch your eye?
While you were up there?
We were in the big one at Circus Circus
That was mostly just you know ticket
Ticket spitters you know gambling for kids
I did see a smaller arcade
That I never got a chance to actually go into
That had a lot of Capcom stuff
Like they had MVC 2
Yeah remember when we were looking in there
You were like no that's my kind of arcade
Yeah well it's like my butt you know
I've got 10 bucks is it gonna last longer on slots
Or on arcade games
So arcade games 1
Ray Ayanami says we should have gone to Atlantis
What do they have there
Oh they probably have really
The problem with a lot of those huge huge ones
They're not downtown
The downtown ones are much easier
Because they're all kind of in the same city block
You don't have to get in the car and go whatever
Anything else interesting in Reno that you came across?
The fact that it's kind of
I don't want
How can I say this without sounding pretentious
Just Reno is
Kind of low budget
I mean that's kind of the point
If you can afford to go to Vegas
You just go to Vegas
So Reno is really kind of watered down
We had a hilariously awful
Dining experience there
Which I thought was funny considering it's
Amazing sort of you know
The El Dorado, Silver Legacy, Circus Circus
It's all one big mall they're all connected
You can just stay in that facility
So it was after Rocky
And it was around 1130 we were all starving
And exhausted
So we sat down
Not even kidding
30 minutes for her to take our order
Another 35 for our food to arrive
So we were at the table for about an hour
And the food showed up and I had joked
That when we got our receipt
For the tip section we should write
In the margin
We put your tip in that slot machine
And you should go get it
Very nice
I've taken something from my
Best friend
She leaves two cents
Yeah I've done that before
I once was in I think it was in Olive Garden
Which is why I don't like going there
Where the friend and I that I was with
It was like 7 cents
It was a very specific amount of change
To where they knew it was deliberate
Well you know it was hard though in that case
I really don't like doing that
Unless it really is clearly
This weight person's fault
But last night I don't know
I kind of got the feeling like the place was just badly managed
Like I felt like the weight person was working
I mean she was trying her best
So I didn't want to be a dick
But you know it was really bad
The food was good but yours was cold
We all had hot food but yours was cold
So that was lame
Very lame
We're going to do this real quick
I'm getting a lot of complaints in chat that we're skipping really bad
And I don't know why that would be happening
So I just want to remind everybody in studio
Take a minute to make sure you don't have anything running in the background
That could be doing bandwidth
What I'm going to do, I'm going to do a quick
Disconnect and reconnect
So for live listeners you might get dumped
Just reconnect real quick
But I'm going to see if that helps fix the problem here
I'm going to do a quick disconnect and reconnect
And see what happens here
And we're going to keep things rolling for the podcast
So just bear with us
This is what happens when you tape a show live
So we're going to disconnect right now
And so
Haha the live listeners can't hear us right now
Are there any live listeners you want to talk smack about while we're doing this?
Smack smack smack smack
Alright let's reconnect
Alright so we're reconnected so we'll see
If that hopefully helps the problem
I don't know but everything otherwise
Looks good on our end
So it could be on the all games end as well
I don't know
So we'll see
Anyhow let's move on to some rapid fire news
And all the quick little things that
You know if we had a five hour show we could talk more about
Loki
Why don't you start us off
Let's see so
There's some interesting stuff here
We'll start with
Of course
Something from Dragon Quest 9
And there was something you mentioned
Robin I don't think it was Dragon Quest
It was um
Oh I remember now
It was 3D Dot Game Heroes
There was like uh
Foo Foo or something like that
It was insinuated like you know sex or something
Yes that is um
It's one of the towns you go in and yeah
You can buy Foo Foo from somebody
For like ten dollars and it makes you
It's very very uh
Well anyways
Apparently Dragon Quest
Um
I guess this is uh
Yeah Dragon Quest 9
There's something you can um
Purchase I guess
It's Poof Poof
Or Puff Puff
I guess Puff Puff Performance
Is a quest you can unlock
And um
Apparently Puff Puff is
Interesting because
Obviously this is an
E10 game there is
No sex involved
But uh Puff Puff I guess is coming
I read this
It's uh
It comes from the Japanese word
I guess uh
Pafu Pafu
Which I guess is supposed to represent the sound
Of rubbing
One's breasts and another person's face
And that's kind of like what happens
In this thing
This French woman
With large breasts
Um convinces the player to sit down
In a chair and she blindfolds him
And then she proceeds to
Perform Puff Puff on him
Of course funny enough
It's not really her breasts rubbing against his face
But it's two slimes against his face
But still
Kind of scandalous
A little bit
Is that really the sound that makes Pafu Pafu?
Is that what they said?
I don't know. Jamie could you come over here
For a minute?
Sure
We have an experiment we need to try
Okay we're gonna put the microphone right there
It didn't sound very Pafu Pafu
Like
Boobs what do you have to say?
They don't say anything
They just sit there and look pretty
Apparently
Apparently it's in the game and it's funny
They had a funny video of it as well
Online and it's very um
Filled with
Induendo
Yeah but E10
It'd be different if it was a mature raid game
Um
Red Faction Battlegrounds
Has been announced for Xbox Live Arcade
And the Playstation Network
By THQ Digital
Is gonna be a prequel to
Red Faction Armageddon
And if
I should say if THQ has it their way
They want to put the game out for free
Or close to free as possible
Perhaps as a preorder
Like
Incentive for ordering
Red Faction Armageddon
So that sounds kind of cool
Um
And is expected to come out sometime
In 2011 probably
3 or 4 months before the game is released
Or Red Faction Armageddon is released
Um
So that's interesting
And then finally
If you're a fan of music games
And who isn't
There is a brand new browser based music game
You can check out called
Instant Jam
It comes from Instant Action
And it's a game that looks very similar
To say like a Guitar Hero
Um
You know one of those games where you have
It sounds like a very instant kind of company
Yeah like the no highway and you know the
Different things coming down
Apparently it supports your own music library
Um and it also supports
Keyboard or USB guitar
Controllers and allows for
In game music purchases as well through
Amazon or iTunes
Um I guess it's a version of download content
And uh
There is a beta currently available through Facebook
And versions um
I guess playable through the website
And embedded elsewhere
Will be rolled out soon
Alright
Well let's move on with some other
Stories here and I want to talk about
Speaking of music games, Dance Central
Has some new songs announced for it
Ten more songs announced this week
Nelly Furtado with Man Eater
Basement Jax with
Rendezvous
Benny Benassi with Satisfaction
Nina Sky with Move Ya Body
Cascada with Evacuate the Dance Floor
Pitbull with I Know You Want Me
Calle Ocho
I know you want me
I know I want ya
Sounds like Strong Bad singing
Fanny Pack with
Too bad it's not the
Fanny Pack song, Camel Toe
But it's Hey Mammy
Mammy? M-A-M-Y
Mammy? Mammy is
M-O-M-M-Y
Depends on if it's a name
Or another language
Roriana has Pond to Replay
Cool and the Gang
Jungle Boogie
Technotronic with Pump Up the Jam
And Kylie Minogue
with Can't Get You Out of My Head
That was a fun song when it was in DDR
like years and years ago
I was going to say there were some
other songs as well
I can confirm that are going to be in the game
In fact I'm looking
Oh is it the whole lyric spill thing that happened?
No, no, not even
More scandalous than that
This is
This is Wonderful People
Shouldn't be in places that they are
Are they naughty people that have already gotten copies
of the game somehow? They're naughty people that have
gotten copies of the beta that's on
Partner Net right now
Of course they can't play anything because
it requires a Kinect camera but
doesn't mean that they won't know
what songs are on there
and included in there
I'm not sure if these have been already announced
Lady Gaga's Poker Face
Lips Ink, Mouth to Mouth
M-I-A, Arlor
No Doubt, Rock Steady
Bell Biv Devoe, Poison
and BC Boy's Body Moving, the Fat Boy Slim remix
A few of those were already out there
but I don't remember the M-I-A song being announced
that's news to me
Interesting
Alright
Well we'll see if
what the song list looks like anyway
I'm sure not too much longer
we'll have the full song list announced
I'll probably give you about ten songs a week till it's all out there
Anyhow, how about Toy Story 3
Yeah it's not just a movie
it's a game as well
The game is out there, it's on the Wii I'm sure
It's also on the Xbox 360 and the Playstation 3
In fact the Playstation 3
is taking the opportunity of
having this unique hybrid premium
edition
So there is actually a new version out there
of Toy Story 3 bundled with
the original Toy Story movie
on a single Blu-ray disc
for 6499
So it's interesting
that it's not just like a combo
pack, but it's actually
both things were put onto one
disc for 65 bucks
Interesting
Yeah
But sadly
it's not both Toy Story and Toy Story 2
otherwise that would be a really killer deal
but what about Toy Story 2?
What about that?
What about it?
Dartatouille is correcting me saying it was Love at First Sight
that was in Max 2 US
Can't Get You Out of My Head, I was really close
That was in one of the US ones
I thought Can't Get You Out of My Head wasn't one of the US ones
Oh well, whatever
Anyhow, how about something non-music
game related, how about an MMO
but this is not the type of MMO you'd think
It is related to Disney though
Disney Pixar has a game called World
of Cars online
and of course you know in the Disney MMOs
you may have heard of this, you can't type in
your own stuff, you have to use the pre-selected
phrases and things that have been selected
for you, well one of the other things
you can do in the game is that you can pick your own car number
because of course you're playing race cars
so you can have whatever car number you want
except for 69
you cannot be car
69 in the car's MMO
Can you be car 420?
No, because the cars only have two digits
but you could be car 54 and you could be like
where are you?
old joke
I liked that show, it had the dude that played
Herman Munster
There you go, so yeah when you're selecting
apparently when you're in the game selecting the number for your car
if you go like, you select each
digit one at a time, so if you select
4, 5, 7, then you see
1 through 9 is the next digit, but when you
select 6, it only goes 0 through 8
so, interesting
World of Cars
online is free, worldofcars.go.com
you can sign up for free
but it is a
$5.95 a month subscription
if you want to get all the features
of World of Cars
that will not unlock car number 69
no just so you know, not even if you
pay for it
Dark Sakura
Well how about some
something different, something in the
Squeenix direction, remember we talked about
Gun Loco?
Well it turns out it's a game about
a planet full of criminals
they're all crazy
crazy crazy crazy criminals with guns
and the world's sort of like
an earthish ruin
type place and there's different
factions and they're always fighting
so
it looks
completely hilarious
I think I would really really
like to play it
all the characters were done by
Kenny Wong and basically made
toys of everything and then they scanned
them into the game so that's how the design
come about, so that's pretty cool
and then
for Rock Band we have the Disturbed
Pack
that's going to be on August
24th a couple days
from now, the Disturbed Pack has another
way to die, Asylum and the Animal
and then
there's Universal Motown Republic
Rock Pack which is Crash King's
Mountain Man, the Vir Union
Seasons and We Are the Fallen Bury
Me Alive
also
only one of those is available in
Lego Rock Band and that is the Vir Union
Seasons and lastly
the big Horkan grocery
store chain in England
called Tesco, you've
heard of them I'm sure
No, because they don't have them here
Actually, they do
There's a company called Fresh and Easy
that's a
Tesco chain in the United States
Still, I don't think I've ever
been to one, but okay
Let's just be opening a couple
in Sacramento
but anyway
it's like a big grocery store chain
anyway, they are now
going to be buying
used games
you will be paid in credit and then you
can buy whatever you need in the grocery store
so
basically they're saying
for Red Dead Redemption you'll get
a £19 trade in
Mario Kart for Wii gets £19
FIFA 2010 gets
£12, that type of thing
and then they're going to resell the
stores at other outlets
and already
about 60 Tesco stores
accept them
Everybody wants a piece of that industry
Now when someone says they have to pick
between video games and food, if money's
certain, they can literally
I had to give up
Red Dead Redemption, but I got some
Top Ramen, awesome
Alright, let's get into some Twitter
topics tonight. Every week you guys
submit us topics at www.
twitter.com slash o-l-r
and we pick a few of our
favorite topics and read through them here on the show
and sadly
I seem to be without my music tonight
What did I do?
I broke it all
Well, I guess Twitter topics cancelled because I don't have
theme songs. I blame Rob, I blame Rob
Live Radio
You just want to
sing the theme song tonight?
Oh, thank god we're all
saved, alright
Twitter.com slash o-l-r
Let's see who tweeted us this week here
Redtertainment sends us a tweet
says, o-l-r, is there a video game
equivalent of Rocky Horror?
You mean a game so bad
that it's kind of good?
Actually, I'll say this, there really was
There was a Rocky Horror show game
There was one of them back in the 80's
on the Apple 2e and the Commodore 64
I believe had a version
and you actually went around the castle
getting parts of Frank N Furter's laser
or something like that, you could play as Brad or Janet
I remember, and then they made a CD
That sounds rather Maniac Mansion
It was kind of inspired by that
There was a CD-ROM based one in the
mid 90's for one of the big
UK revivals and it actually
had like, back when full motion video was in
every CD-ROM game, they actually had a
Rocky Horror show game there, but it was released
I think exclusively in the UK, so I never played it
I don't know if people out there did
but that would be it
What about a game so bad it's kind of good?
How about not taking the question so literally
and a game so bad
it's kind of good?
Like, I think about Loki and how he talks about
Driver 3 all the time, that it's so terrible
that it's actually kind of fun
Earth Defense Force 2017
It's a very terrible game
but it's very fun
I think back in the day for me it was
Abadox
I don't know if I can think of one
that I really go, gosh that game
is so bad that I just love it for some reason
Anything come to your mind now?
Think of?
I'm not sure if I'm thinking of
terrible or just really difficult
but Battletoads?
I thought of one
I thought of one, a game that we actually played
on end because it was so awful
What's that?
Batman 3
It had the butt monkey in it
Seriously, it had this
like a baboon, so it had the big exposed
butt, and it would fly
its butt at people
and then there was this one guy who his
taunt was shooting people
He could just take damage off by
taunting, just shoot
bang, and it was so bad
and the voice acting was so horrible
and even to this day when
I'm hanging out with Mystique and we see a monkey
we'll go butt monkey dance
butt monkey dance
because he danced when he won
Tigerclaw
leave it to him to have the Google Foos
skills to find more information
The Rocky Interactive Horror
Show game was released in March
April 1999
it was later than I thought
for the PC by Online PLC
Similarly to the earlier CRL game
the player plays as Brad or Janet
and must rescue their partner from the castle
unlike the older computer game
its gameplay was more puzzle oriented
and benefited from the added detail, graphics
and live video sequences that the PC could provide
Was Frank-N-Furter in it though?
because if Frank-N-Furter
is not in it, I mean Tim Curry
single handedly makes
that movie, he does
The screams of
thousands of people when Frank-N-Furter
first shows up in the movie, tell me so
Alright, anyhow
Let's see, other tweets
that we have Twitter.com
Tigerclaw
sends us a link about an Italian city
that's pissed at Gran Turismo 5
Now why would you be angry at Gran Turismo 5?
Well apparently
Siena is a
city in Tuscany, Italy
They're very unhappy that
one of their, I guess
famous roads, the Piazza Del Campo
is actually a race course in
Gran Turismo 5's kart mode
They want it removed in the game
The road is
in the game or the structures or what have you
It's also
I'm just trying to
see what it is here
Sorry, when we get things from Twitter
we haven't had a chance to look at them in advance
or whatever
I guess because it's also partially
a horse race, oh I see
the Piazza Del Campo is also
the name of a famous horse racing track
So I guess they don't want people to kind of get
confused over what's going on there
So they've sent out a quote
diplomatic request to Sony
to resolve the matter
This game is coming out very soon though
so I don't know if it's going to be able to be fixed
unless they patch it out
because that's how they fix everything these days, right?
Let's see
I'll read this one too from Tiger Claw
We give everybody at least two tweets
So Tiger Claw says it's this tweet
Disney Online hits a traffic high
with 36 million monthly
visitors, wow
How much are on Facebook?
How much of that's on Facebook? They don't really get their
users through Facebook, do they?
But they do Club Penguin
You've seen those Club Penguin cards at Target
and all those other stores. That's probably their biggest game there
They also have Toontown Online
Disney Fairies Pixie Hollow
I didn't even know there was a Disney Fairies Pixie Hollow
There you go
So lots and lots of games that Disney has
They've hit quite a milestone there
Never played one of them
I love Penguins too
I don't know why I've never played Club Penguin
but I just haven't
DJ Blazekin sends us a variety of stories
Some of them we're going to be talking about earlier or later
But this one I don't think goes on our showroll
This has to do with other Blizzard stuff
Big things planned for Diablo 3
at this year's BlizzCon
Apparently there is big Diablo 3 news coming out
at BlizzCon this year
It's going to be split into three games
No, let's hope not
I guess this is coming out of
Gamescom. It's the games director
Jay Wilson saying
I can say that this BlizzCon
in terms of Diablo news
will be the biggest one that we've ever had
Well it's probably because that's the game they're going to focus most on
because by that point we ought to know the release date
for Cataclysm
and it'll be out either just before or just after
Did they even have BlizzCon back in
Diablo 2 days?
No, they didn't
Of course it's going to be the one they've had the most time
I don't know what the hell that means
They're going to reveal another playable class in the game
They say there's only going to be one more
a fifth class and they've announced all the others
Cheerleader
Let's hope. Maybe they'll release a peripheral
for the keyboard like they had on
We Cheer. That'd be great
We'll see what happens
You know what's really interesting though about that is that
with Starcraft 2 having had
the digital distribution day one
but Diablo 3 is going to have that too
so I wonder if it's really going to have that big
midnight launch or what have you
I don't know
Let's see. Anyhow
Oh dear
We're getting linked to this by ActDeft
and I just see Furries in the title
so I'm worried about this
He links this to a story from Kotaku that says
Microsoft Connect supports Furries
and it's got a video on it
Do I want to see this?
We know what you're thinking
Will Microsoft Connect read your body
when fully encased in a fur suit?
And again this is coming from Kotaku I guess
Yes and sure enough somebody is dancing there
in a full kitty costume there
to Dance Central
Thank you ActDeft
for wasting 30 seconds of my life
I will never be able to get back
So at Dragon Con over Labor Day weekend
they can yiff
in the privacy of their hotel rooms
or they can get their gaga on
Bobby's going to Dragon Con
I hope he's still listening
Bobby I would really like to request
a full furry report
on the furry scene
at Dragon Con
Bring some Purell
I'd say bring the candle
I saw
DarkKusuke sends us a tweet on Twitter
saying that Star Wars Clone Wars
Open Beta opened today
Really I did not know that
A lot of these big games
coming out the Christmas season
I guess are having their betas open up
When's the DC Universe one open up?
That's the one I really want to play
Really bad
And lastly Alex P. Carson tweets us
saying does anybody know the official name
of the Super Mario version of M.I.A.
Paper Planes that was on the Afterbirth
a while back
That's making me think
There's a website that has tons of chiptunes
and I can't think of the name of it right now
but hopefully somebody in chat will remember
and we found it on there
and I bet if you search for Paper Planes
you could find it
There's some huge chiptunes website
and I can't remember the name of it
like it totally escapes me right now
Somebody in chat will remember what it is
It's like it's just a bunch of homegrown stuff
and if you like that you'll probably like a lot of the stuff that's on there
So hopefully somebody in chat will shout it out here soon
If not I'll Google it in a minute
I'll find it
Let me Google that for you
Alright that's gonna do it for Twitter Topics tonight
Don't miss tweets in the future
Twitter.com slash O-L-R
In the meantime while I try to figure out
what song that was
Loki
This week both the Guitar Hero
Warriors of Rock tracklist
and Rock Band
3 tracklists
were revealed
and it's interesting
because there's definitely a lot of stuff to go over
So let's start off
with Guitar Hero
Warriors of Rock
There's gonna be 93 tracks
I'm not gonna go through all of these
But some of the ones I thought were interesting
Rush 2112
They have all 7 parts of it
That's kind of neat I guess
Let's see
What are some of the ones that stood out to me
Rammstein
They've got a song from them
Looks like
Wade Mann's Hyle
Let's see here
REM Losing My Religion
Queen Bohemian Rhapsody
Of course both games have that
awesome song
By the way there was a Queen
slot machine that I played in Reno
and it's the most amazing
gambling device I've ever played
The bonus
round it lets me pick a Queen song and then
the game plays itself for free for like
a minute while I sit there and listen to Radio Gaga
It's amazing
That's cool
Um
Let's see what other songs on here
Um
They've got like actually a bunch of
Just a bunch of everything
About one song from each artist on here
Some of the ones I actually recognize
Let's see of course they have
Deep Purple, Burn
The
Queen's Clearwater Revival
Fortunate Son
Download content from
Rock Band 2
Foreigner feels like the first time
Um
By the way did you see
that video where they
fessed up that the Rock Band 3 leak was real
basically? Yeah they have the
Rock Band full track list behind
them. Yeah that was funny
Um anyway so yeah
lots of stuff, ballista's out there
Um
Looks pretty cool
And of course Rock Band 3
Uh we've got
Let's see here
Lots of things from there
Um their track list is
a little bit smaller but of course you get all the download content
from Rock Band 2 and
all the tracks from that and anything else
you pretty much have bought
So starting off with that
They have Amy Winehouse in
Rehab but I didn't really think of that as a rock
song but okay
Um
They of course uh let's see here
Devo, Whip It
They have Imagine by John Lennon though
Which I don't think of as a rock song
But I think that's a sweet
addition to the game. Hell yeah
Um one of course I was excited about
when they first announced it
Huey Lewis and the News, The Power of Love
Just need back time now
Perfect
I heard that song a ton at E3, that was in the E3 build
Um
Leonard Skynyrd Freebird
Of course on there
Marilyn Manson, The Beautiful People
Ozzy Osbourne,
Crazy Train
I know they had another Rammstein song on here
Duhost
Which is pretty cool. Not pussy
Is it in German?
If it is in German that would be great
I have to sort of digress
Why not? That's what we do here on this show
One of the E3 trips, all the DDR Freak
moderators got together and went to the Korean
karaoke place and Duhost was on there
and we were all
singing Duhost in our worst Rammstein
German voices
Duhost mich!
Oh that is great
Um you know Police Don't Stand So Close
to Me
They also had
I hate this song
Smash Mouth Walkin' on the Sun
The Sounds Livin' in America
At least it's not that
Hey now, you're an all-star
It's Avon, get paid
I think that was in Lego Rock Band
I hate that song
Um
Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers
I need to know
Curse of Fears, Everybody Wants to Rule the World
Lots of cool stuff
I'm just looking forward to actually being able to play
a lot of these songs with the keyboard
Which would be really sweet
I really hope they go back and add keyboard support
for some of the old classic download songs
Yeah I don't know if they're gonna but
They need to
They really need to
Just sayin'
Oh of course they have Deep Purple, Smoke on the Water
Probably the better at Deep Purple song if you ask me
Alright
By the way, just to answer that tweet from a few minutes ago
Finally found the answer there
We're using my Google FU
The listener's in chatroom and found it already
But just for anybody else who's listening
The artist's name is CSLSX
And the website I was trying to think of
8Bit Collective
Which is actually a really good website for a bunch of chiptunes
The number 8, not spelled out
Actually the number 8, bc.org
And you can get all these NES chiptunes
Actually that was like the worst possible clip
of the song I could play for you guys
But it's not bad, go check it out
More news for you guys
This is about a new peripheral
Which I find kind of interesting
You don't see a whole lot of these
3rd party peripherals, or at least you're not used to
You start seeing more now, like you know
DDR mats, and rock band guitars
And so forth, this is something a little new
THQ is putting out a new game tablet
For the Wii, it's like a drawing
Tablet that you
It's actually kind of like a combination, you put the Wii mode in there
And then you have actually this little tablet
It's called UDraw
It's a 4x6 inch tablet
And it's going to be coming out for the Wii
And it will be coming out for $70
And it comes with UDraw Studio
It's a drawing, coloring, and art based
video game, which I think is kind of cool
Mario Paint! It's Mario Paint basically
And how long have we been saying they need to do
Mario Paint on the Wii, so
THQ is kind of doing it the way it ought to be done
And what I love too is that one of the promotional
shots here for the game
Is somebody who has drawn
Wait for it, I'm trying to bring it up here in the studio
They've actually drawn on the screen, oh damn
It's a unicorn, somebody drew a unicorn
But unicorn works too
I'm wondering if there would be some way
They're going to make an adapter to use it on the PC or something
Because it's definitely
cheaper than buying a Bluetooth
Adapter
In the end though, I mean
I paid $400 for my tablet
And
I can use Photoshop
But Jamie, can you draw that
bitchin' unicorn? I could draw that unicorn
right now
It just got a hit on Apple a little bit
But the fact that the Wii has a proper
tablet means that it's more of an iPad than the
iPad is
There you go
Look, I'm drawing a unicorn right now
Yay
Actually, you know what, we've been
needing new album art for Orange Lounge Radio
And I'm still waiting on those pictures
Well I think it should be, you took one of me like
years ago, anyway
No, I think we should just have a giant unicorn
In the album art
Speaking of unicorns, and I know I'm a little bit
behind in times because I used to check
their YouTube feed every now and then
They have a new Charlie
the Unicorn, except it's not Charlie the Unicorn
It's Charlie
Teh-Unicron
And it's like these remixed versions of
the Charlie the Unicorn episodes
And it was hilarious because they burned
down the forest
Candy Mountain
Alright, anyway
Some other games that are coming out
That's not the only game coming out as the Mario
Paint-ish clone
U-Draw will also be getting launch games
Pictionary, because you know, you gotta have more
of the board games on the Wii
And Dude's Big Adventure, that's D-O-O-D
Like, doodle
He, dude
Dude's Big Adventure, it's a world where coloring
books come to life
Apparently it's heavily inspired by the game
Drawn to Life, which was also a THQ game
So they're just kinda like, you know, getting themselves there
I'm sure the next
Drawn to Life game will support this as well
We'll see
There's your damn unicorn
I can't hold the pen very well
I can't hold my stylus very well to control my
Can you put a picture of that up on orangeontradar.com?
Alright, awesome
Okay
Awesome
So yeah, U-Draw, I don't know, is anyone in here
interested in U-Draw? I guess Dark Soccer made
a pretty good case for it, if it would work on the PC
Nope
Yeah, I'm not really interested either, but I do want an iPad
Nope
I think a lot of
dinner parties have ended in divorce
due to bad rounds of Pictionary
And I'm glad that that experience can come
now, come to the Wii
To a whole new generation
Dark Soccer, I hate to tear you away from
unicorn drawing, but there is more gaming news
to be talked about tonight, correct?
The Doctor
Doctor Who, there's going to be a third
game
Oh, well, a third episode
of Doctor Who, the adventure games
This one's called TARDIS
And you get to fly the TARDIS
It'll be out on the
27th of August, and
the whole thing is that you have to
explore the entire TARDIS
And the TARDIS is freaking big
Remember, it's bigger on the inside
And
then you can fly the TARDIS
So, that's pretty cool
You know, it's basically
overcoming 40 years
of what's it like to pilot the TARDIS
in one game
Although, really, the TARDIS
is meant to be piloted by six people
It should be a bullet hell game featuring the TARDIS
The TARDIS can't shoot anything
That sounds retard-ous
Anyway, this one's featuring
the 11th Doctor
being Matt Smith
and Amy Pond
played by Karen Gillan
So, pretty cool
And it's free!
For all you people in the UK
Oh yeah, don't we have to pay for it though?
Because the Brits get it subsidized with their television tax
or whatever, but we have to actually pay for it
Yeah, we don't have TV tax
Lame
I mean, great that we don't have TV tax
Although, Comcast kind of, you know, sends me a
TV tax bill every month, but I guess that's a whole
other issue
You know I am going to be ditching cable TV though
Well, with an HD receiver
Like, I can just go get a good HD
antenna for 50 bucks and I can get my basic
channels, which is all I watch on cable
So, why am I bothering?
Although, I will say cable internet is where it's at
My internet with them
has actually gotten way faster recently
Now I'm getting, you know, about
I don't know what it ends up being
with megabits, but I'm getting about
one and a half megabytes
per second down
I forgot the sparkles
Thanks for downloading things really fast
Plus, we got some more HD channels, so I've been watching
Man vs. Food and
Lots of Ninja Warrior
I did notice a shit ton of new HD channels
I watched six hours of
Ninja Warrior straight one of these days
because I had to wake up with
Joshua, and he didn't want to go to sleep
and I couldn't change channel
But he didn't want to watch Ninja Warrior
I watched Ninja Warrior, I watched like three seasons of it
I like that you're teaching him young
Ninjas are awesome
Will you be an equal opportunity household where
pirates are also?
If they have a cool pirate game show, then yes
We'll watch the pirate game show, but
Right now it's just Ninja Warrior where it's at
And then of course G4, you know, they have to do
the American Ninja Warrior
And that just, that is about
as bad as the stupid American Iron
Chef, and you know, I hated it
a lot when it first
came out over here, but
now not so much
Just because I don't think I have the Japanese one
to compare it to anymore
Plus, Julie Chen
is a judge a lot on Iron Chef America
And I love Julie Chen, just saying
Wait, what are we talking about now?
You're ditching cable
The Doctor Who game, that was it
We got to the end of it, so it's all you, Logie
I'm sorry, it was
all these different tangents and I forgot which one
I see you shopping on eBay over there, it's all good
Yeah, I know
I don't even know what I'm looking for, I'm just looking
Because that's what I do
One of the things that's kind of funny
We were talking a little bit about different systems
being hacked, well, something else
that Microsoft had hoped wouldn't have been
hacked, but it was, was the brand
new Xbox 360
system, the S slim, whatever
the hell you want to call it, apparently
the
I guess, mod chip creation
group
Team Executor has been working
closely with Team Jungle, who has created
you know, drive firmwares
for the original
Xbox 360 systems, and
Commodore Forever, also
responsible for
firmwares for those systems and hacking
DVD drives, and now
they have figured out a way
to be able to patch
the DVD rom on those new
slim systems to
play backups, so yes
they have now created a new hacked
firmware for that
So
They just keep
trying, but they find ways around it
But again, if you
go online with it, bananated
right? Um
I'm not sure, because
I would assume, yes, eventually you'll
probably get banned, but
the newer firmwares nowadays, they have
light touch and stuff like that
are apparently really
stealthy, like it's very hard to detect
them, so
maybe? I don't know, I would assume
eventually, yes, but then again
I have a system at my work
that was supposed to be modded
and it hasn't been banned at all, then again
we've not played one burned game on it, we just
actually, it's funny, I bought it
to replace another modded system, that's
when we decided, hey, you know what, let's just play some
normal Grand Theft Auto games instead of the modded ones
Um, we will be playing the modded ones
again, but we're not modifying our drive
firmware, we're just doing disk swaps, so that
even if they did detect, you know, that
we were playing a modded game, when they look at the system
the drive's not modded, so
They can't ban me!
Well, they can, but
I would have
a fighting chance
Alright, you don't, you haven't
had to play, you haven't had the opportunity to play
around with one of the new 360 models, right?
I don't really care, I mean
it's neat that they changed, you know, the way
it looks, and I like how it makes little noises and
stuff when you click on the buttons
Um, and apparently there's some like
way, I, or, I remember
now they're gonna have the new sim system
with the Halo stuff
and it's gonna have some different sound effects for that
that's kinda neat, but
yeah, I mean, I don't know
I wouldn't need one of these
but, I don't know
if someone gives one to me, I'm not gonna turn down
Alright, well
do you like to cut in line at big
trade shows, or
I guess not necessarily a trade show, but big conventions
and uh, you know, have everybody hate you?
Uh, well here you have your
opportunity if you are a member of the gun club
it's uh, Electronic Arts
one of their uh, little promotional clubs
they actually are running a promotion right now
where you got an email
and if you want, you can skip the line
to see Dead Space 2 at Penny Arcade
Expo, if you have a copy of the email
that's right, you can skip the line with a printout
of the email, and uh, Penny Arcade
Expo's coming up in a couple weeks, that same
Labor Day weekend that we're thinking of doing a long show
and uh, there you go, you print out the email
now why hasn't somebody just put the email online
and then you just mass
print it and then go, maybe there's like a barcode
on it or something we're not seeing, I don't know
probably, no, I don't think that's the case
I think it's just people don't want to do that
so that, you know, the line for that is
really long, why would they, well
it's gonna have the same line anyway, you know
it's, exactly, and you know
what, and it, it does suck, but then
again, it's their booth space that they're, they
paid for, they can do whatever the hell they want
it's a strange precedent to be setting
I mean, I, the only weird
oddity about it for me is that, you know, and I
made a big mistake calling it a trade show earlier
because it's not, but PAX is more of a
convention, and I always thought one of the things
that was supposed to kind of separate it is that
everybody was on equal footing, like media
doesn't get special treatment there, you're not
supposed to be doing all these like media appointments
and things, like that's what E3 is for, even though
especially the years that E3
went to
the airport
in Santa Monica or wherever it was, PAX
kind of started to get a little more of that
uh, where, you know, you could get in early if you
were media and so forth, but I always thought PAX was supposed to be
this place where everybody's on equal ground
so, then, why
is it now that some people are
special, but of course, you know, again, it's
this company, their email list, they're just
trying to pimp the service, the gun club
they're trying to pimp it to make it have some values
so that people can sign up for it
I don't remember if it costs anything, I think it's just
I know you, like, for example, if you buy that
Battlefield Ultimate, uh, you know, Battlefield
Bad Company 2 Ultimate Edition or whatever
you get membership into the gun club
I don't remember if it costs anything
initially to sign up or whatever
but you get, like, you know, into the Medal of Honor
beta, um, early
and stuff like that, so it's little
tidbits of that kind of thing that are supposed to
I guess they're making it worthwhile
but, um
I don't know, like I said, they're a booth, they can
do whatever the hell they want
Toagak in our chatroom at chat.orangelandre.com
says, I like the whole, we don't care if you are
media stuff, believe it or not, me too
I, and I wish they did the same thing at E3
I know that sounds weird, cause, like, you know
I, I, you know, can get media
credentials for E3, but I just, I kinda
like it when everybody's in the same footy, but E3
you can't see E3 anymore without
Here's the thing with E3, planning it out six months
in advance, even if you do get media credentials
it still doesn't matter, because
they basically look at you
they're like, oh, well you're not IGN
or, you know, 1up
or whatever, so, well we don't
know who you are, so we don't care
you know, so it doesn't matter, you can get
it's because a lot of the marketing people
behind video games, don't play
video games, and know nothing about video games
there's so many of them out there
that just don't
they don't even know the product that they're
selling Oh yeah, I know that, I deal with a lot of
corporate sales reps from these
companies that are talking about the games coming on
and I start asking a question about stuff and they're like
I don't know, I don't play games, it's like
you know, you don't even know your own product?
I mean, come on
It's pretty astounding
kind of sad though
but
we just have to support those companies that
you know, know what they're doing
just like Konami, they don't like to
invite us anymore to things, but I understand
they're not in San Francisco anymore, but
so what, you know, you can at least send the damn
invite, and if we can't make it, that's not a big deal
well, the DDR thing was public, and I thought
that was great
yeah, that was a great way to do it
exactly, let all the people who really want to see it, go see it
alright, anyhow, let's
open up the mailbag
yay, every week you guys send us emails
here at mailbag at orangelandrado.com
we select a few of our favorites
and read them here on air
mailbag at orangelandrado.com
looks like our mailbag is very full from that mail we got
I'm not reading all of them
so don't be
butthurt if you don't get your email read
basically if it was one asking us to advertise
usernames, or asking us about
advertising, or asking us
about those types of things, we'll be replying
to you offline
um, first one up
um, hello O.L.R.
Haseo Sumi
uh, I can't say anything
Haseo Sumi Ragawa
um, hey, or Pliskin, as it was
in my last email, yes, it's a Metal Gear Solid reference
um, if Rob still
hates Justin Bieber, have him watch this, whatever
um, sorry, it's a
a video that I haven't pulled up
oh, everybody saw, it's probably him
getting hit with a water bottle
I saw the Keyboard Cat
version of that
and Dark Sakura, if you still love Doctor Who
I have a video for you, and I pulled it up and I'll watch it later
it's the Mighty Morphin' Dalek Rangers
and on to non-Bieber
stuff, um, okay, I tried to
download a shady copy of Bleach Heat
the Soul 6 for a Japanese game site
but for some reason it keeps saying
corrupted or unsupported data, any suggestions?
punctuation?
um, no, I'm kidding, um
I would say, um
check your region
what?
what was the question?
it downloaded a copy of Bleach Heat
the Soul 6 from a
Japanese game site
but it says corrupted or unsupported
data is that through an emulator
or through a console? it didn't say
he downloaded it?
give us more details, dude you get what you pay
for, I mean
re-download it
I don't know, if it's a PC game
then it sounds like it's just a corrupted download
and you have to re-download it
if you're downloading a pirated version of a game
of some sort, um
perhaps you need to burn it at a lower
lower speed
if you're pirating a current game
I don't think we can really help you
I mean, you're not supposed to be doing that, naughty naughty
if this is a game I don't recognize
from like 10, 15 years ago
they don't make anymore
well then, we can't help you
I think it's a PC game
if you bought it legitimately
then call the people who made the game
they can answer
he said shady
and third I would like to thank Rob
for his advice on an earlier episode
what you said helped, I told my friend
but not family for certain reasons
and I'm currently dating someone, once again thanks
oh, I'm glad to hear things worked out
I remember that email
so, um, good
I'm really really glad to hear it
and thank you Dark Soccer for reading my email
if you didn't, what the hell?
well, fine, thank you
thanks as always, your loyal listener, Haseo Sumiragawa
well, I'm
very glad, I hope my
headache hasn't made me too grumpy when reading it
um, oh, good lord
long
email
helping Akai Ripper
might be the longest meal in
OLR history, I don't know, it might be
good morning
everyone, this is the other Swede, Jiditz
writing in, I usually
rant about something, or comment
on things that were brought up during the last live show
but not this time
during episode 376, which is the show
before the previous one, Akai Ripper called in
and told us of his angst and how Blizzard had wronged him
seeing as that episode
went up kind of late, I didn't have time
to listen to the episode before the next
one aired, and couldn't share my knowledge
and experience when it comes to activating and playing
Starcraft 2, all that is about to change
so hold onto your socks and put your pants back
on because it's, what?
because it's time for a story of epic proportions
filled to the brim with angst
I have to put my pants back on
yeah, cause Rob's been
sitting here pantsless the whole time
I'm comfortable
twas the morning of the 27th
of July and the first thing I heard
was the blaring of my alarm clock
proclaiming it was the time for me to get up
had approached
excuse me
didn't mean to do
with slow steps I went up to the kitchen
to prepare my breakfast which on this
specific day consisted of two slices of toast
and a cup of coffee, the perfect combination
of breakfast items if you ask me
after gulping down my coffee
I went to feed Gullen, my polar bear cub
and then
oh my god, get to the point, like
I appreciated the storytelling, but
hold on, and then proceeded to get ready
to leave the house, now you may think
I went up early to stand in line to get my copy of
Starcraft 2, but you were sorely mistaken
you see, during the summer break I managed to acquire
an ingrown nail on my big toe on both my
feet, ow, this made walking
overall quite painful, so I promptly got in touch with my
doctor who had a spot open during the
27th of July, Starcraft 2 day
after a swift drive to the doctor's office
and later an extra 20 minutes of waiting
I finally get placed atop one of those
odd beds they have at the hospital and the
doctor arrives, oh lord
ok, ok, ok, ok, ok, look
I realize we're all about where every gamer
has a voice, and you know, I
want everybody to have their say, but
next time let's just try
some shit went down, and
no, I'm trying to see if there's a point
Jamie Summers is not your LiveJournal client
no I'm not, some
and I feel really bad about your
ingrown toenails, dude
you know what, I
I think, get a LiveJournal
I think Alan's making
a really good point there
I feel like an ass now, I'm sorry
that was really nice, but
I'm not trying to be rude, but it's a
3 hour show, not 10
we can read this email during the
Labor Day show, I'm gonna read
I wanna read out of it, fine
after all the crap with the doctor
paraphrasing of course
I wondered how
I could get the damn game, I thought
I could get it at home, so I went home
I'm paraphrasing now, ok
thank you
you turn it on, start a firefox
pull out the credit card
and then
Blizzard wanted to pay 60 euros
which is about 589
point 80 Swedish kronor
which is 77 bucks
for the digital purpose
at the local store it's 399 kronor
which is 52 dollars
so to buy a physical copy
it cost him 20 bucks cheaper
to go get the physical copy
so he did that
blah blah blah blah blah
gonna install it, gonna play
no, ok
now this is where I'm gonna read the email again
cause I'm pretty down into it now
the game said my Blizzard account did not have an
activated copy of the game associated to it
which I found to be strange since I had seen
with my own eyes, a quick google search revealed
I was not alone with this problem, but I was sad
that no one had found a way to fix it
so now we get to the point that might be able
thank you, might be able to help everyone
who has a similar problem, specifically
OkRipper, and having problems
getting through to the customer service support line
just email customer support
I emailed Blizzard support explaining my problem
which I had, you know, what I had tried
and that I would love some information on what I was doing wrong
within 6 hours I had gotten a reply that said they had
fixed the problem with the following
and the following attempt to play Starcraft 2
was successful, and it was beautiful
alright, story time isn't
is over, but this email isn't
so straighten up your backs and get ready for
Jiditz Indie Game of the Century
uhhh
there's codes
oh, sweet, codes
oh, are we supposed to read the entire email
and then light the codes for the reward? oops
I've been giving this guy a hard time
toigak in chatroom says, control F
point
hahahahaha
my point is
so
my friend who happens to be the developer finishes
Xbox Indie game Seaside Racing
a couple weeks ago and is now up for sale
on Xbox Live Marketplace for only 80 Microsoft points
Seaside Racing is a
stylistic physics based kart racer
made by a single person and is
currently features 3 maps, Xbox
Avatar implementation, and up to
8 player multiplayer, there's trailers
up here, I'll link it in the chatroom
umm
he has 4 codes to give away
sweet
we are going to be giving
away codes later on
maybe we'll post them on like Twitter and Facebook
to some fans later in the week
I will actually save this
email then
but I might keep a code for myself
I want to play it
PS, big thanks to Dark Saga for reading this long email
umm kind of
oops
oops
oops
oops
to tell you a story
I would have believed the polar bear
and I'll tell you why
when Lord Byron
you know the poet, went to college
he was not allowed to have
the rules were no dogs allowed on campus
but it did not say anything about a bear
so he had a pet bear
I think when he went to Cambridge
true story
true facts
so the polar bear could have been possible
I wanted to know what kind of toothpaste
he used, I could have
used what type of magazines
in the doctor's office
so yeah
I just don't think your email was detailed enough
to get a sense of
the situation
and dire urgency
I moved it
to the inbox
I'm glad to hear that emailing blizzard support
was a great option
I just want to say though like you could have condensed
that down to twitter size
tell akehripper to email them
just
move to inbox
here's some codes
no I'm giving this poor guy a hard time
we do appreciate the email
I'm sorry I paraphrased
but I did read it
and it was entertaining
and I want a polar bear now
I'm just going to replace the pony
you know when I go to a restaurant
and someone says is there anything else you'd like
say a pony
now I'm going to say a polar bear, thank you
yeah because one time you ended up getting a coney
when you asked for a pony the waitress brought you a
coney dog and I laughed
I took it home to Dan though and he ate it
and you totally felt guilty like the waitress was
going to take it back going oh
you were trying to be funny
oh I see
people usually do laugh
blame the sonic intercom
speaker
by the way one of the sonics in Roseville closed
just so you know
I know the one that was built into the
what's up with that
where was the other one
there's one over on
I'm sure our international listeners
in Mexico really appreciate this talk
but I think it's over on like Paradise
Grove or whatever that street is called
you know what I'm talking about Office 65
go up 65
and there's like a
Pleasant Grove that's it
Pleasant Grove
that's where it is
over by Walmart
by Walmart
I think it was the first day you ever met Alan
yes it was
and we had tater tots and it was magical
next
up
hey guys this is
I'm not going to read your name sorry dude I don't care if you put your name in there
I'm not reading it kid whatever
it's been a while since I've talked to you
I'm not sure if you've kept up on the money
related to music activities
I've been doing but I have some new
releases on disco warp music
that I think you'll want to post about so please get back to me
with an email address where I can send you some press material
pin my music
um
send him here
you have to email him to do that
he's probably not actually
listening to this show
was he on it? didn't we have him on years and years ago?
yeah but he's probably listening
well hi
well dude if you're listening email
um
Troy
just sent a simple message
dan plus o-l-r
equals awesome
he's not here anyway so I ain't gonna tell him
stop it
I'm trying to keep him
in his place
and you are inflating his ego
we need some dan sucks emails
is what we need we need him to get some hate mail
no because then I'll cry
everybody gets hate mail I marry him
only I'm allowed to say he sucks
you know what I'm gonna write an email to this show right now
rob
rob rob rob rob
may I have my hat please?
no you threw it it's mine now
no it's mine I'm gonna put it on my head
oh this
is cool it's from robaba
and it's actually someone I'm a fan of
um writer Peter David posted
on his blog that he is writing the Tron
comic book I'm not sure if it will
be released as a graphic novel
it probably will as it catches up
on the story behind Tron Legacy
I'm not a fanboy much but I am a
Tron fanboy I actually like Peter David
and I've read um
some of his Star Trek novels
and I think he wrote
the novelization for Iron Man
so it was I like
his writing a lot so
all I know about Tron is that I heard a rumor
this week that the Muppet
3D theater at California Adventure
is supposed to be being transformed into a Tron
3D preview I know
right? that's pretty much
the same noise I made when I heard
I didn't quite
make that noise but close
is that it for emails? no
like I said we have a bunch and I'm only reading a few
another one from robaba
now that Microsoft announced Windows Phone 7
a near random thought came to mind
is Game Room meant for the mobile phone?
it also has a heavy emphasis
on games in your live account
I think they are smart to do this
since games would be one of the few things
to rope people in you know they actually
what was
what was Microsoft's the Zune
were they
were they supposed to have had Zune integration
for Xbox Live
Indie Games I think was a rumor a while back
that XNA would play on the Zune 2
remember that thing at E3 where we sat on the big floor
with the subwoofer built into it
and it vibrated your butt every time the bass
would go loud and they had the phone
integration thing and people pulling
them around for their big pitch
yeah yeah
I don't remember what it was called
but I guess Microsoft
released a smartphone that came
and went in like three months
I posted it out on my Facebook
is that this Windows Phone?
it had a very
specific brand name
like a Zune obviously
but that's their music player
but there was a Microsoft phone
that was out for two months
I had never even heard of it and they were like
oh the kin
I remember they had the girl on Facebook
going around and meeting people
and people were like who the fuck are you
anyway
ooh a hard
question
yay
what I'm excited
you're as exciting as being
forced to eat Robin's minstrels
greetings
I come here today with a question about morality
I've always been a PC gamer
and usually pay between 20 to 50 bucks
for games Wheel of morality
turn turn turn tell us the lesson
that we should learn
and today's moral is
early to rise
and early to bed may make a man wise
but socially dead
read the damn email
and as long as I've got some good time
out of it I'm fine paying that
now I won't lie and say I haven't gotten
some games by other means either
now to my problem I've recently bought a PS3
and am appalled that there isn't
fire and blood protesting
at these $60
price points for games
as game companies whine when their games
don't make tons of profit
you know as well as I do
that when Steam puts a game up for 50% off sale
it sells like hotcakes and the developer makes
money has there been any PS3
game developers that put their game up for
40 to 50 bucks I wonder if they
would sell more
and thus make more
3D Dot Game Heroes was
$39.99 maybe
$49.99 but it was in that price range
you talk about there I believe
in America it sold
$150K which isn't
terrible but I
don't know if it'll have a sequel
actually for an atlas game that's really good
but it also came out around the same time as Lost Planet 2
Escape 3, Red Dead Redemption
split second blur
and that is also one game
and I can't think of a whole lot
that were cheaper I guess Super Street Fighter 2 was cheaper
yes
it was also you know an upgrade
to a game that you'd already paid
50 bucks for before
well now he's saying I've included a link
to the new PS3 USB hack that might be real
of course we covered it earlier
and to be truthful at $60 a game is it a little
it is a little tempting what do you guys think about it
your loyal turtle in Philly
is serious turtle
um
games are expensive but they've always been
expensive Street Fighter 2
speaking of which since we're talking about all these Street Fighter games
the original cartridge was what 70 bucks
Mortal Kombat was that bad
Chrono Trigger was pushin' 80 at one point
killer instinct I paid 60 bucks for
at Montgomery Wards
and keep in mind this is
10-15 years ago without inflation
oh no no no I was still in high school
no I wasn't I was in college
this was about 15 years ago
it was before I moved out here so yeah about 15 years ago
so you know video games have actually always
kind of been a little bit expensive
they dropped a lot when they went to CD
and that was part of the charm about
why CD gaming was really good
because they weren't putting all that extra chips
in cartridge so by the time the PlayStation 1
PlayStation 2 era came around they actually
dropped in price quite a bit
but now they're slowly climbing back up to where they used to be
not that I'm necessarily saying it's
justified because you're right there's a lot of
crap out there for 60 bucks
that really shouldn't be
but again what was I saying about
the marketing people behind video games earlier
that many of them
they don't play games oh yeah they don't play the games
so everything to them
is gold
I think that gaming fandom at large
or at least this is how the corporations
have kind of treated gaming fandom is that
they're very fickle
and they have a very short attention span
once a game is older than three months
no one cares
like remember when I said buy Starcraft 2
six months after it comes out
and it's like well no one's
everyone's going to have moved on by then
you have to charge your 60 bucks
because once the game is three months old
and you've made your money back by then
no one's going to care
movies are very similar
if you don't make your box office back in several weeks
then
direct to DVD when everyone else buys it and it becomes a cool hit
yeah
so I think it has a lot to do with
the analysts and their margins
of if this game doesn't
sell this much past
six weeks or whatever
their benchmark is then
yeah so they charge you 60 bucks for it
people who don't play video games are ruining the gaming industry
alright
I have one last email
are you ready?
yes
um
yo guys I just recently got hooked on your show
and I was very sad to not hear your
angelic lol voices last week
anyway I'm emailing you
wondering if you have any good PSP
titles that you could suggest to me and other
listeners as I am slowly getting tired
of Monster Hunter 2, Dissidia
and Fireteam Bravo
two thirds I guess
I'll honestly go for
almost anything aside from sports games
ew thanks and may the Flying Spaghetti
Monster bless you pro butcher
aka somebody
um
all hail his noodly
goodness uh what was I going to say
da da da da
if you like Dissidia
Final Fantasy 1 and 2 remakes are excellent
on the PSP
I think Luminous
the old puzzler and it's sequel
I think the sequel is good
some of the best puzzle games they ever put out on the PSP
almost was like a reason to own the system
I liked Every Extend Extra
which was another Mississippi game
I liked Papa Locross for a good RPG
Loco Roco is a cutesy game
if you like cutesy games
there's you know
PSP has quite a few little highlights in there
and a lot of the ports are surprisingly not bad
like Little Big Planet on PSP
32nd Game Heroes
since I was talking about the 3D Dot Game Heroes
the 32nd or Half Minute Hero
whatever it's called is pretty good too
and there's also going to be the new Kingdom Hearts game
coming out in September
and the Valkyria Chronicles
if you like that kind of thing
also of course
there was I believe a Persona
game that just came out
on PSP
um
and there should be more stuff coming out
in the 4th quarter of course
if you like music games
DJ Max is out there
and I like Rock Band Unplugged
but not everybody liked that
but if you like your 2DX type games
DJ Max is a good alternative
I think that's it for music games
Alf in our chat room
is suggesting
Hatsune Miku Project Diva
I forgot about that one
good call
some of the PSP collections are really good too
like the Gradius collection was pretty awesome
there's some pretty good collections of games
isn't there like a Mega Man collection on PSP as well?
it's pretty cool
but there's Mega Man
Mega Man X remade
the 3D
they also have the powered up Mega Man
the super deformed Mega Man 1
alright
well there you go, is that it for emails?
I thought there was a last minute
do you mind if I refresh the inbox?
it was from you
you were sending it wrong
so I'm not checking it
are you going to read it?
I think you should read it
I'm just so upset
she's taking away my voice everybody
that does not fit with the show
I know
it's a show where every gamer has a voice
and I am not being heard
especially since you are a super game analyst
I know
I am a video game analyst
dark sakura just read it and she wants to die
what's it say dark sakura?
I hate you all so much
I want you all to get the hot shotgun bullets to die
I wrote dan sucks lol
but I spelled sucks s-u-x
because I know she loves that
that sounds like proper English to me
I mean, sucks
that's how it turns out on my phone when I text people
I don't know what to say
I don't know what to say
I'm on my own when I text people
alright, ow
you see this?
it's mine now
it's landed in my yard
what the hell is it, Alan?
you're sleeping on the couch
alright
this is definitely the time of the show
I approve of Alan, thank you so much
this is definitely the part of the show where we're going to get angsty
with a segment we call the FUs of the Week
FU to my head hurting
and Rob
you stink
you sucks
um
I guess FU to lack of sleep
but you know
the baby doesn't know better
he just doesn't know what night and day is yet
and he also
had trouble pooping
hopefully he is past that now
because I hate trying to make him poop
it's difficult
well, it's not difficult
but it's gotta be embarrassing for him
but he doesn't know anything yet
tell Nellie to stop eating onions
that has nothing to do with him not pooping
you know, I'm really curious
if we're going to have a
are we going to get
are we going to get poop stories every week on OLR now?
that would be great
sure, I can tell you poop stories
see, because he is constipated
so he can't go
you have to take
so he has to have little
suppositories
put up there
poor guy
but it triggers him to poop
and he this morning
he pooped like 3 times
congratulations
it's good for him
but he still grunts all night long
and does his kung fu
that's quite good for having him watch Ninja Warrior
Alan Jeff and the FUs
hopefully the don't involve poop
his first word should be hadalken
FU to salmonella
E. coli and other invisible poop
that hides in your food and makes you sick
when you go on vacation
bad eggs?
bad chicken I think
maybe it was a bad egg
alright, my FU of the week goes to the
casinos in Reno, Nevada
what came first, the bad chicken or the bad egg?
my FU goes to the casinos in Reno, Nevada
for taking a large, undisclosed
sum of my money away from me this weekend
it's not supposed to happen
meanwhile, all my friends are going
I won $400 playing craps
how did you do?
Dynafire
no, I'm happy for my friends
but I'm sad for me
that's what's really important, right?
just a couple more stories
for you guys, and then the Skype line
we're gonna take your phone calls, oh god
Loki, what do you got for us?
don't sound too excited there
so I have some news
about Super Street Fighter 4
of course, the arcade version
has a few empty slots
available for some new characters
and that's what they're gonna get
they're gonna get some new characters
that are gonna be, I guess, exclusive to the arcade
at least for right now
of course
it doesn't say exactly what characters those
are gonna be, I guess that is yet to be determined
but there will be some new characters
coming
any characters you'd like to see
in Super Street Fighter 4 that haven't
come in yet?
Alan, I know you're a big fighting game fan
or any character that didn't make it from its
I'm assuming they're gonna take more characters from Alpha
and put them in
I wouldn't mind
Rolento
also, what's her name?
Alema?
Elena?
yeah, Alema's your Warcraft character
yeah, from the
kick character from Street Fighter 3
was awesome, her
might get to see it, who knows
Darsakra, I know you're a Capcom
fan girl too, any
extra characters for Street Fighter 4?
that I wanna see?
well, in that arcade
version, I would love to have Sakura
if there was another arcade version
well, she'd be in there because it's all the regular
characters I'm saying for an arcade version
I would want Sakura, and
other than that, I'd say
Ibuki
because I was a big Ibuki player
or maybe Karin
alright
I got one more story for you guys
I know who would be great
you know who would be great?
Rainbow Mika
she was the funny chick wrestler
with the heart pasties
alright
moving on to another
talking about a movie
we probably would have talked more about this last week
if we actually had a show, but we didn't
so this is Scott Pilgrim vs. The World
is making a lot of news, but
sadly for the gamers, not the kind of news you like to hear
it is not doing well at the box office
BOMB
in its first weekend at the box office
it made 10.6 million dollars
and while that still is a lot of money
when you really put it into context
it kinda sucks, because if you look at
some of the recent releases that have come out
and again
what did it cost to make?
Scott Pilgrim is, I wanna say 15
but I don't know for sure
is that profits?
no, this is just straight box office tally
so then it made less than it cost
I believe
they're saying that, yes
but here's the thing too, I should say this
technically it's not a video game movie
it's a comic book movie
but it's still got the whole
video game tie in
but this is the really sad part
is that the movie
Gamer with Gerard Butler
made 11.8 million
it made more money than Scott Pilgrim's first movie
but that's a generic action movie with Gerard Butler
I mean this movie didn't
have a lot of big
names in it, I mean Michael Cera
yay, I don't know
that and people have really
terrible tastes
Vampire Sucks
being number two
not to say that Expendables
is a bad movie, but see that's once again a generic
action movie, I mean if you like action movies
you go see that, it's gonna be awesome
whereas this is basically
some guy that's
falling in love with a woman and he has to fight
her exes, I mean that's
that's like
that's almost like my super ex-girlfriend
or something like that
which is also lousy, but yeah
I mean that's the kind of vibe
that sends off, I mean granted it was an awesome
movie, but not a lot of people
really get that kind of stuff
I mean they're not us
Well for what it's worth, it made more money than The Wizard
which made 4.2 million this opening weekend back in
1989, and Alone
in the Dark, it did better than a new evil movie
Oh well I hope so
And Double Dragon with Scott Wolf only made 2.6 million
dollars this opening weekend, so at least
it did better than that
And Scott Wolf does not like people reminding him about
that movie
So you really liked Scott Pilgrim right?
Loki?
I loved it, I'd go see it again
I just like the whole vibe of it, there's a lot of
in-jokes I guess if you're a gamer
a lot of things and references that you catch
I like the characters in it, like I said
one of my favorite characters was Wallace in there
because he was just cracking all sorts of
comments and stuff throughout the movie
But see one of the things that
bugged me about the movie is that characters
like him, they just kind of disappear
there's a lot not resolved
I feel like they tried to cram too much
with six comic books into one movie
but I mean, how else are you going to do it?
I don't really know how
They did it with Watchmen and Watchmen worked
True
What did you think of the movie, Alan?
I liked how the
video game fandom meta stuff
was put in
As far as the actual story, I didn't
care for it, I thought it was kind of creepy
and sexist
Because I'm all, I don't know
I'm too serious about that kind of stuff
Because you're a lesbian
They glossed over some of the characters, like the twins for example
They kind of glossed over who they even were
We just knew they were twins, she dated them at some point
and they had a battle
and that was it
I don't even know why they were terrible
Well, I kind of think they should have just cut that scene
out of the movie and just had her have five exes
You know what I mean?
And so they could develop something else
It just seemed a little strange
Part of what I really liked about it
I think I liked it more than Alan did
Although I did have some problems with it
including an unlikeable main character
I thought that
it was so random in some parts
that I couldn't help but laugh my ass off
Vegan police?
Yes, you're a vegan
Telekinesis
I just liked all the
different random things
in there, like for example
At the end where he's complaining
He's like
I can't believe he did that
It took me two hours!
Two hours to look up all their information
and contact numbers
It was funny
The League of Evil Exes
See, I thought for sure that he'd become
part of the League of Evil Exes
at the end of the movie
Oh my god, spoiler!
I said I thought that he would
Didn't say he actually did
Alright, anyhow
It was, um
It was, it was okay
No, I'd say I liked it
I think I liked the direction
and the ambiance of the movie
and just the whole, like, you know
just turning my brain off and enjoying it
as like a video game, you know
and I'd see it again, especially because
Dark Soccer still hasn't seen it
And seriously, you need to check out the PlayStation Network game
It is awesome
I bet it makes a really good
video game, ironically
It's an awesome game, and it's by that guy
who, remember when we were doing
Marvel vs. games
or whatever, that you guys voted off
Oh, how funny
Because he does really awesome pixel art
I don't remember his name now
But yeah, he did the whole game
River City Ransom-ish
Well, I love River City Ransom
I've been playing with the avatar creator
on the website, though, that's pretty fun
Yeah, I made a little avatar on there, too
Ooh, what website?
It's on the Scott Pilgrim vs. the World website
Look at her Facebook or my Facebook, it's there
Alright, let's open up the Skype line
Take some calls
1-877-GAME-OLR is our phone number
or you can give us a call on the Skype line
Our username on Skype is
OrangeLoungeRadio, that's all one word
But as a reminder, if you are gonna call us
with your computer, please
call Echo123
first, and I think in the newer versions of Skype
they actually say, make a test call
Do not skip that step, it's very important
because a lot of our crap calls
come in because you didn't test your connection
and then we know
Or you can always use the trusty old regular
telephone and you don't have to screw around with that too much
1-877-GAME-OLR
Meanwhile, while we wait for some calls
to come in, are there any last minute stories?
Yeah, Just Dance 2
just announced the
track list for that
some songs that they have in there that you can
dance to, I guess
I'm getting hammered with calls, we better go to the calls
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
Hello?
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
It's Kine
Hi, Kine, how are you?
What's on your mind, buddy?
Not too much
I was calling in about
the Poof Poof reference
in Dragon Quest 9
Yes, please, what about it?
The reference
in 3D Dot Game Heroes
is actually from a previous Dragon Quest
off of the NES
Really?
It was titled Dragon Warriors
here in the States
Yeah, and I can't remember which one it was
but I think it was the first Dragon Warrior
that came out
I played it off the last one in the trilogy
I didn't even catch
that as being an original
Dragon Warrior reference, I just thought it was
funny, because don't they do this whole thing
where they, like, in 3D Dot Game Heroes
it's been a couple months since I played it, but don't they do this whole
like little switcheroo thing where it ends up
it's her dad giving the
you know, massage or whatever they play it off
that's going to get you mad?
Yeah, and that's why I remember
what I said, that's also the inside
joke, there's a lot of Dragon
Quest and all the references inside
of that game
In like the first round, you can go in the back
and there's a slide and there must be
humans from Dragon Quest 3
so
I thought
No, I appreciate it, in fact
it's kind of funny to know that now that
that actually was from a
another game, it was kind of another
little reference and not just something they made up
but I like that 3D Dot Game Heroes
man, if you played, especially if you like
actually grew up with the 8 and 16 bit games
even if you didn't, if you have an appreciation for them
but especially if you did like grow up with them
I think they're just, like
it's just a hilarious video game because it's made by
nerds like you and me, clearly
Yeah, it was
definitely marked before
people that grew up, you know
in the 8 and 16 bit era
Um
Oh yeah, that was the other thing
I demand a
Commodore 64 episode
Oh yes, I think I was joking about this
on the forums, the Commodore 64 episode
of OLR, well if we end up doing
this whole marathon thing we're talking about for
Labor Day, I'm gonna see what we can do about
bringing some Commodore 64 content into it
absolutely, maybe I'll make
the cast sit down and play what would be a
good old school Commodore 64
game to make people play, we could actually, we could
do a Summer Games 2
Championship and we can all
play the different
countries, that would be awesome
Alright, well Kyan, thank you so much for the call
and have fun with 3D.GameHeroes
it's a great value
Alright, thank you
Alright, later
1877 Game OLR, if you'd like to give us a call
or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio
Let's go to another call, hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio
Who's this?
Hey, this is Butcher
either on email or DarkKiske
on Twitter
Butcher or DarkKiske on Twitter
What's on your mind?
I just want to make this quick
Thank you guys for giving me
PSP game suggestions earlier
Oh, this was your email, okay, yes
And that's about it
right now, but
I had something else and it
completely skipped my mind
Uh oh, see
this happens to us a lot when we do live radio
is that we're actually doing a show and then we forget
what we wanted to talk about, but that's why we always
write things down before we
do the show, but even then it sometimes
doesn't help us, but okay, so
you got, you were asking
for the PSP games?
Yeah, that was me
Did any of those sound interesting to you? You think you might actually go out
and pick any of those up?
Yeah, once I actually get a job I'm probably going to go out
and hunt down a few Final Fantasy games
You know, unfortunately, that is the
problem a lot of people are having right now in this economy
is it's just, it's kind of ironic
because we got that email about the high prices
of games too, and
it's just, you know, within this economy
it's so hard to kind of afford
a lot of that, and a couple weeks ago here on
the show, it was about three weeks ago now, we had that gal
and I'm so sorry, I forgot her name, what was her
I remember her real name, but she went by something
else here on the show, the gal who sat here
the night Loki had the baby
Oh, Ashley, um
No, I forgot what her
Yeah, her online name
I forgot what her online name was, but Ashley
Yeah, I knew that, but it's her online name, I couldn't remember
But she was a big on the budget gamer
She's going to be back
Yeah, she likes the cheap games
You know, there's a difference between cheap
and piracy, and you know
there's a lot of worthy cheap games out there
and free ones, because she said she was a big player
of what was it, like Runescape?
Was that the game? And it's like free
You can play that online
Alright, well anyway, good luck with the PSP
and let us know if you do find some good games
to pass along to the listeners, let us know, alright?
Yeah, sure thing
Alright, take care buddy
Oh yeah, go ahead
Thanks to you, to you for getting my name wrong
early on Twitter, it's not
DarkKisuke, what did you say, Kisuke?
Yeah
Anyway, that's it
Ah, I do my best, at least I read it
Alright, take care, bye
Alright, have a good night
I try my best
It's not spelled out phonetically
I'm probably not going to get it
We're getting a lot of calls tonight, but this is awesome
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
Hello
Oh, it's Xenocore
Hey, how you doing? A little delay there, that's alright
Hey, no problem man, it's been a long time
I know it has, how are you doing Xenocore?
Well, I've moved
five states, uh
managed to secure a job after three attempts
and many layoffs, and now I'm
working for Dell
Well congratulations
Well, doing army support
Very cool, wait, you moved from where to where?
You were in what, Virginia before?
I was in, uh, I was in Sebastian, Florida
Now I'm in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma
Oh, wow, okay, that's quite a move
Going from the east to the midwest
Wow, alright, well
How you liking Oklahoma? I've been there
once, I was 17 years old
Many years old
It's pretty much like living on a space colony
as close as you can imagine
There's little things to do here and there of everything
but you try to go outside the perimeter and there's
nothing but wasteland
Yeah, it's kind of isolated
That's pretty much where it's at
Well, what's on your mind tonight?
Uh, not much, not much
I'm actually getting ready to restart my
show, and I've been writing
for the Electra Sisterhood magazine
in the meantime
I have heard they launched a magazine
and it's not an e-zine, right?
It's an actual tangible super magazine, right?
No, no
You can get it in either form, they got it in PDF
as well as print
Wow, that's good for them, that can't be an easy venture
for them, so
I always seem to run into Ninja Sister at trade shows
and I think she's adorable, I really like her
She's been on some of the OLR special shows
She's great
Yeah, we're pimping everything out on landofesh.com
now, so
Oh, very nice, I didn't know there was a whole new website
We'll go check that out, absolutely
What kind of articles are you writing over there?
Well, the last one I did was a review on how
the marketing departments of all these games seem to
love to play with the words
and tell us what game is
actually not that, like how I got
pissed off with Demon Souls, I wrote all about it
in there. Very interesting, because
we were just talking earlier about
and I apologize, this might not have been what you
wanted to call in about, but we were talking a minute ago
about how it seems like a lot of marketing
departments don't actually play
video games at all
Oh yeah, that's corporate nature
in general, they'll sell the stuff without even
getting aware of what the hell they're selling
Yeah, you think it would be better if they did?
Eh, not
really
Sometimes it's just the mentality
The guy who can survive doing sales for a living
really doesn't have a lot of time to even
play these things, so you know
I just rope it up to that's the way the
world is and keep going
Gotcha. Well, I think I got us
off on a tangent, but besides your
work on ESH, what else is going on
in your world that you might want
to call in about tonight?
Not much, not much. I did see
Scott Pilgrim, but the one
guy, actually I just recently saw it today and
was quite happy. I started Facebooking all
over the place for it, but the one
thing that surprised me that I haven't
seen before was the
voice of reason and the
guiding light in the entire show
was Scott's
roommate, and this is the best
possible example I've seen of just
a normal person who just
happens to like guys too that's
treated with a little bit more respect
than I've seen in other mediums
things getting better lately. I
kind of agree with that, that was
it was pretty cool the way that
it was just like the cool
gay friend and that's just the way it was, but I think it
also shows like I kind of go
back to the original comics and from
what I've read on the original comics is that
that character was inspired by a real
life interaction that the
author of the comics had with a former
roommate of his. I think it just kind of goes
to show that the younger generation
especially, you know, and when I say that
God I make myself sound so old, but just
even folks that are like 10-15 years younger
than us, like it's just not even an
issue anymore. And if you look at the people who
do have an issue with
you know, same sex
relations and what have you, it's almost always
old fuddy duddies
you know, like that
I don't know why they're so threatened, but
it's just comforting to know that you know
especially a lot of the folks that listen to this show
it's just whatever
you know, it's just not even a big deal
you know, so I think it's great
cause that's the way it should be, it's just people like
who they like, I don't even think
you should have to be gay or
straight, just be
nice
Exactly, exactly
All we need
And I have one gaming accomplishment I gotta share
before I go, I managed
to find a working
version of Escape
from the Planet of Robot Monsters
and I got to the last dude and lost all the
rest of my credits there, it was epic, I loved it
How long did it take you to do that?
It took me about a good hour
but that game was
jimmied so that way we could still use credits
they took off the continue
limitation and everything, I actually got pretty
decent at it, but that game is brutal
it's as brutal as it should and half these games
that can only be played through MAME
right now, they need to be re-released
like whether on PSN or Xbox
Live or whatever, at least the newer ones from like the
late 90's and such
but that's all I got
keep gaming alive, excellent job guys
I'll talk to you in the future
Thank you so much for the phone call, I appreciate it buddy
Have a good one
Later, you too, bye bye
We can take some more calls
877-GAME-OLR
or our username on Skype is orangeloungeradio
and we'll
take some more calls, looks like things finally
slowed up here for a minute, we can get back to the
Dance 2 story if you want
Some of the songs in there, including some of the
really annoying songs, they've
got
let's see here, Kesha
with TikTok
OutKast with
I was just thinking there's not enough gutter
trash on the Wii
The Pussycat Dolls
When I Grow Up
I don't recognize a lot
of these songs
Avril Lavigne, Girlfriend
Let's see here
Bonnie M. Rasputin
Cher the Shoop Shoop song
Donna Summer's
Hot Stuff
This game sounds more and more like a 70's
disco with each song that you read
Ike and Tina Turner, Proud Mary
Wow, alright look
we're gonna go to a phone call to save this
We also have Justice with D.A.N.C.E
and that song is awesome
Hi you're on Orange Lawn's Radio, who's this?
Hey it's Ron, how's everyone doing tonight?
I am great, how are you?
I'm good
Before we get to you Loki
congratulations
Thank you
You're welcome
I saw Scott Pilgrim vs.
the World on Saturday
I enjoyed the movie but
the only issue
that I had
maybe because it's my
ginormous ego and my portrayal
and my odd views of the world
I just didn't like how
Scott Pilgrim was portrayed
as this socially inept
awkward geek
maybe it's because of the people that
I've run with throughout the years
I've never come across anybody
as bad as him
I can see that
Yeah
Yeah
To me
Isn't that kind of what Michael Cera is
in every movie he's in?
and Arrested Development to some extent
Michael Cera needs a shot
Jesse Hinesburg should have been in that movie
He was the kid from
Zombie Land
Yeah I know
What's funny is people think
that Michael Cera was in Zombieland
because they keep mistaking both guys
I'm like no that's two separate people
Hehehe
But did you like
otherwise besides the whole
main character which is funny enough
was one of the big problems I had with the movie
did you kind of like everything else about it?
Yeah I did
I even had to convince my best friend
to watch the movie
so maybe her view will be a little bit different
if she watches it
Yeah
It's kind of a bummer
that it's doing so terribly at the box office
because you know
I feel like people will never try to do
another movie like it
Why do you think the movie is bombing so terribly?
Simply put
it went up against The Expendables
and Julia Roberts
That's the only reason why it tanked out
Now if it went up
if it was out during an off season
it would have done good
because personally when I saw the poster
I'm like hmm maybe
I'm like okay I'll go see this
then The Expendables happens to show up
I'm like this is my 80's childhood right here
80's childhood
versus
geekdom geek fandom versus 80's childhood
Yeah exactly
and I'm asking people
give me faith in the movie
don't give me reasons to see it
just give me faith in it
unfortunately there was no faith
For me with The Expendables
it's like wow everything I don't
like about 80's movies in one movie
I'm like there's the perfect movie for me to
not see
At least that's
how I felt about it but you know
Well
at least I'm happy that
the movie is getting a sequel but you know that's just me
Alright
Alright
anything else you want to share with the
listeners tonight?
I picked up another DJ Hero
turntable controller for 20 bucks
and I'm looking forward to DJ Hero 2
Yeah now's a good time to get a
turntable controller if you have any interest in DJ Hero 2
because you could probably get the turntable by itself
and then DJ Hero 2 by itself
for much cheaper
than the combo
Maybe because I think it was only on sale
with Best Buy and Kmart
for like two weeks only
and now I've been checking prices
it's back at the regular price and my turntable
control was on back order for about a week and a half
Tekken 6 is on sale for 10 bucks
at Best Buy
Much better than 60
If you have the $28 coupon card
which you can print out
Alright Rob we're going to let you go so we can
try and get at least one more call in here before we sign off
for the night but thanks so much for your call okay buddy?
Not the problem Luigi
out here
Alright bye take care
Let's see one more call here
I'm going to try to get to tonight. Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio
who's this?
DJ Blaziken
DJ Blaziken what is on your mind?
Not much
other than some possible new game
for Butcher to pick up when he gets in cash
Actually
these games went down to like
10 bucks
and they are
Twisted Metal
I think
they even dropped
I think it's
I think it's
It was Quiz World for $7.99
on PSN
and then
oh yeah
Beats
which I also have a
review for
which it's kind of like
if you were to take
oh
Beatmania and just have three lines
that's what Beats is but the cool thing is
it's kind of like Stepmania
or ITG
where you can use your own music and
it goes off your memory card
like your whole music library
that you got on there
A lot of those games that make their own music
and I reviewed one here on the show just like I think
a couple weeks ago we were last on the air
there's that game that was on Steam like
Rhythm Zone or something like that that uses your own
MP3's and it's
Bootsy to use a word that Irene uses a lot
it's a Bootsy game because like
the note patterns that come up with the music you make
are just not interesting
yet a game like Audio Surf
I think is actually a lot better
and it makes its own patterns too
based on the MP3's you're playing but you're not
hitting buttons at random
like flailing on your keyboard in time
to the music. Audio Surf the game
is kind of different it's like a puzzle game mixed
with music mixed with action
I don't know it's different so it works for me
but I mean is this other game
you're talking about button flailing or what?
Okay
actually but this one though
it uses all four
the extra circle square buttons on your PSP
and
but the cool thing is
well here's the only jip of it
I tried to play along with some of my
DDR soundtrack songs
it won't work with them. It doesn't work with
anything under
two or three minutes
Oh that's weird
so I hate to say it for all you
B-Money fans who wanted to use your
B-Money soundtracks
for beats you're out of luck
That is kind of weird that it
won't work for such short songs
I wonder if that has to do with some type of like scoring
algorithm or
I can't even think of achievements
It's a scoring system but yet it'll work
with stuff like
the Initial V soundtrack
which I have
and like the only
B-Money song I have on there from
that which
I think everyone knows Night of Fire
of course
you know and
a lot of the old DDR songs
and I mean old old old DDR songs
came from a series in Japan
called Dance Mania X not to be
confused with Dance Maniacs
or just the Dance Mania albums
and if you can go to those albums
you can find a lot of longer
versions of old school B-Money songs
because they were all trimmed down from
CD cuts that were three or four minutes
long
Wow I had no clue
of that. There you go you learn something
new every day. Alright
Yeah Dance Maniacs
I do have one
and so
basically I was just
wondering what the heck else
you know oh yeah
even though it's import only
but I say it's worth it
if you love racing games
a lot of stuff like Ridge Racer might be starting to get tired
of it but also loves anime
Initial D
Street Stage
with
PSP
which
I don't know where else to get that because
nowhere
sells it here in America
Well if it's not something
you can get on the Playstation
store you have to
kind of go the harder routes of trying to find
Fish Up a Copy on eBay or Amazon
or one of those but they're you know
the internet really
so
Alright well anything else on your mind buddy before we let you
go
Hey I got a little question
for you on the fact
you're like I saw
something that was back on the old
games and it said a little thing on your profile like
you had some previous college and high school
broadcasting experience
and I got asked this too
what got you interested in broadcasting
That's a really good
question
That's because Rob
is a big attention whore
Partially that
Here's the thing when I was in college
No I know but no part of it is I'm
an attention whore I do I like the
getting the like for instance last night
at the Rocky thing that I was doing
I got to lead you know four thousand
some odd give or take a few thousand
in doing the time warp and that felt
awesome like just you know like all the
people doing you know what I'm telling them to do
is just kind of cool like you know
it was cool but to be honest
where that all comes from I got into
radio in college because I actually originally
originally originally was studying
to do computer science because you know I'm a nerd
I thought I'd like computers but for me
wasn't for me I didn't like it it's for other
people but not for me I actually had a really bad
professor that I think kind of just turned me off of the whole
thing but I switched
to studying television I was
actually wanting to be for a little bit I wanted to be a weather
man and then I was going to be a broadcast
journalist and I actually interned for a little while
at a CBS station up where I went to school
but I found that the
television industry from my perspective
from doing all that again for me
you know obviously there's people that are into it but for me
too competitive and too cut throat and
you know kind of the same thing with radio to some extent
but when I was doing college radio I kind of
got to do things on my own terms and you know
it didn't matter if no one was listening even if one
person was listening it was hilarious
and got to have fun doing it so
when internet radio came about it seemed like a real
natural progression although to be fair
I think without Travis
having kind of helped me make that
transition he's the host of
Under Station Alive I don't know if I would've
gotten into internet radio as quickly
as I did I think I would've
gotten here eventually
but I don't think I would've gotten into it
as quickly as I did outside of school but if
I actually wanted to go way way back and I don't think
I've talked about this a lot on the show but way
back in high school a friend
of mine used to have a public access show we
actually did on the local television
station so I actually had a TV show for about
two years my good
friend in high school and I actually produced this show
that we did it had nothing to do with video games it was more like a
little comedy show that we did just because we could
and it was great we got turned
on it was great there are very few
copies out there in existence and I am
very very
careful to not let that hit the internet
because I just don't want it out there they're all in your
mom's garage right ah somewhere
yeah my
friend Shannon would have copies of every
episode somewhere and my
mother has them somewhere although I don't know where they
are and the tapes probably melted by now and I've
YouTube I nope nope
that's I will not let them out because I do not
want them on YouTube because unfortunately
now that I do have this show
I think if people were to see that
I just it's no
and granted it would be a pain
in the ass to rip that from
video tape right now yeah
but unfortunately if it fell in the wrong hands it would
be done sooner than I would like it
to happen I'm not it's not
that I'm necessarily like embarrassed or whatever
but it's just you know what it's just not
what I do now
ah so ah
yeah but I did that show and that was a lot of fun and
the whole reason I got into that in the first place
what I wanted to get to to answer your question
ah I had
a substitute teacher one day
in a physics class and he came in
and he was actually trying to do his little like
emotional thing like you know because the public access
station was kind of hurting for more volunteers
and so forth and he was actually showing us a
video that he did like a music
video and my friend and I looked at each
other and thought this is so
like
ghetto that like if
he can do this we can do this
and that was honestly what got us
into it so we should do public
access that'd be hilarious it's so
funny to me now to hear when people
say man orange
launch radio and I've had people say this and it's like the
ultimate compliment I can get orange
launch radio like got me into doing what I'm
doing today because I heard it and I was like
I want to do something like that actually
actually that is
you guys are kind of my inspiration
I've listened to you guys since
oh my god what was it episode 50
back in the old live 365
station which I did mention in a
beatmania review for KIOS
915
here in Omaha
and I actually mentioned your guys
old bemonnie more show
awesome because of course I was
reviewing beatmania so I figured
you know if you like you know the stuff that you
hear of the clubs during the rave period
or the stuff that you might have heard way back
when on orange launch radio bemonnie
more show
go up this game woohoo
well thank you for the plug I appreciate it
that is awesome and so
but I just hope I'm on KIOS
dot org live stream
and 915
KIOS for Omaha listeners
if there are any besides me
um jazz from studio 1
is the show that I'm going to be on
um and then a few other
broadcasting students
I'm getting the first show
October 7th well best of luck
to you that is awesome
but I laugh because when people
when people tell me that I think
back to the video I saw in high school and I go
I hope people aren't saying I was inspired by
orange launch radio because they thought this show
was so terrible and ghetto
I can see that
but even if that's the reason then more
power to you I don't even care
I think it's great actually I had somebody tell me to my
face that they got into public access
because they thought my old TV show
they said blah blah blah was so
terrible and so awful
that you guys really inspired me to do this and I
was like oh thank you
alright
alright buddy we're going to let you go
the call's going on but hey
good luck with your show
thank you you rock have a good one
bye that's awesome
that is really the ultimate compliment it really is
and I think we'll end on that note so thank you
guys very much for the calls I'm so sorry
to those that didn't get through but hey we'll be back next
week so please send us emails
mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com or
twitter.com slash o-l-r we would
really really appreciate it
alright um
we're going to wrap up we're done we're going to close up
the shop for the night although I do want to make sure
Loki gets out any other last minute stories he wants
um just really quick
I was going to say um
there's also the a partial
track list for the Michael Jackson
um game the Michael Jackson
the experience and the first
few songs from Michael Jackson that'll be
in the game of course Bad
Beat It, Billie Jean, The Earth Song
The Girl Is Mine, Who Is It
and Workin' Day and Night
Workin' Day and Night's the only one I don't
recognize but
I'm sure I've heard it I just don't recognize
it by the title
um yeah so that's it
they have some really stupid looking
you know how they do those lifestyle
shots where they have like someone playing the game
and they show like you know
what it looks like on screen
this guy looks like a douche
so I don't know if I want to play this game
because I don't want to be that douchey guy
I kind of am curious
I'm curious just to see what it is
I might play it once in a dark room
when nobody can see me
and then I was going to mention there's a game
um called Minitroid
that is I don't know if it's out yet
or it's possibly being worked on
but it's basically a
remake or demake of
Metroid 2 but it's a
browser game and um
it's really
cute looking it's kind of small
but uh
I don't think it's been released
yet but it is coming
alright

switch sides and become a villain or a
mercenary and there's a whole new world in there
