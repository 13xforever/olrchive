1
00:00:14,226 --> 00:00:19,572
[SPEAKER_05]: Tonight, August 29th, 2010, could Sony soon adopt the controversial online pass?

2
00:00:19,952 --> 00:00:26,700
[SPEAKER_05]: Two retail chains jump in the used video game market, and an upcoming MMO plans to penalize players that play too much.

3
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:39,268
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio, the video game show where every gamer has a voice.

4
00:00:39,688 --> 00:00:48,273
[SPEAKER_03]: We do tape live every Sunday night at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.

5
00:00:48,713 --> 00:00:57,379
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be joining over the next few hours with my awesome co-host, always here every week, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

6
00:00:57,679 --> 00:00:59,379
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope I'm always here, it's my house.

7
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:03,260
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there have been times where you haven't been here and those are the awkward shows.

8
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,781
[SPEAKER_09]: The awkward shows where Dan's like, are they going to run off with the vault?

9
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:11,441
[SPEAKER_03]: There's also been about six different studios in OLR's history.

10
00:01:12,062 --> 00:01:15,542
[SPEAKER_03]: We tend to bounce around like a homeless college kid.

11
00:01:15,722 --> 00:01:16,702
[SPEAKER_09]: This one's my favorite.

12
00:01:17,182 --> 00:01:19,923
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because you just have to roll out of bed and into the studio.

13
00:01:20,203 --> 00:01:22,323
[SPEAKER_03]: This is my least favorite because I have to drive out here.

14
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:23,764
[SPEAKER_03]: At least I like you.

15
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:25,644
[SPEAKER_03]: I like your garage too.

16
00:01:26,244 --> 00:01:26,664
[SPEAKER_03]: It was nice.

17
00:01:26,724 --> 00:01:27,545
[SPEAKER_03]: Except it was hot.

18
00:01:56,118 --> 00:01:58,219
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, so... You seem to be doing okay, though.

19
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:14,187
[SPEAKER_11]: You seem to be awake enough, but if you not... Well, I can thank, you know, playing Final Fantasy XI for early hours in the morning, you know, to thank for that, since, you know, that kind of got me accustomed to, you know, being able to operate without that much sleep.

20
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:16,828
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if you nod off during the show, we'll know what's going on, right?

21
00:02:17,711 --> 00:02:18,131
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura

22
00:02:47,604 --> 00:02:49,446
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, it was fairly old school.

23
00:02:49,486 --> 00:03:05,059
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if the pile of Master System games is still out in the front room, because I've gotten used to it out there, but Dan was playing some Alex Kidd and Shinobi World, and Zillion, a lot of Zillion, and we played a couple things together.

24
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:05,900
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

25
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,241
[SPEAKER_09]: That only came out in Brazil.

26
00:03:25,481 --> 00:03:27,942
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was also after the Genesis version was out.

27
00:03:27,962 --> 00:03:30,823
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, you know, remember, Blast Processing was the secret to Sonic.

28
00:03:30,883 --> 00:03:31,343
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember that?

29
00:03:31,863 --> 00:03:38,225
[SPEAKER_03]: So there wasn't... Yeah, I mean, yeah, there was a Sonic on the Master System, but it was a little bit, you know, not... It was way after the fact.

30
00:03:38,565 --> 00:03:43,267
[SPEAKER_03]: So I sort of saw, back in the day, Alex Kidd as the Mario on Sega's system.

31
00:03:43,327 --> 00:03:44,347
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I don't know.

32
00:03:44,527 --> 00:03:46,628
[SPEAKER_03]: In my young mind, that's kind of what I saw.

33
00:03:47,248 --> 00:03:47,769
[SPEAKER_03]: Monopoly Monopoly

34
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:06,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wow.

35
00:04:07,126 --> 00:04:11,951
[SPEAKER_09]: As in Monopoly, but they actually did M-O-N-O space capital P-O-L-Y.

36
00:04:11,971 --> 00:04:12,472
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.

37
00:04:12,492 --> 00:04:13,453
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have Monopoly.

38
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:14,514
[SPEAKER_03]: Monopoly.

39
00:04:15,695 --> 00:04:16,335
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

40
00:04:16,495 --> 00:04:18,297
[SPEAKER_09]: But Dan didn't actually have the Master System.

41
00:04:18,497 --> 00:04:20,740
[SPEAKER_09]: He was using the Power Base Converter on the Genesis.

42
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,942
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I played some Star Trek online today.

43
00:04:23,582 --> 00:04:25,264
[SPEAKER_09]: I made an Andorian chick just because.

44
00:04:26,465 --> 00:04:26,625
[SPEAKER_09]: And...

45
00:04:30,475 --> 00:04:44,485
[SPEAKER_09]: I was given a game on Steam and one of our listeners sent me something fantastic and I put it over here because I've been waiting for Dan to get off the old school kick so I could play Final Fantasy XIII.

46
00:04:44,685 --> 00:04:45,025
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

47
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,988
[SPEAKER_09]: Gave me Rival School's drama album.

48
00:04:49,048 --> 00:04:49,889
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, from a listener?

49
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:50,549
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

50
00:04:50,689 --> 00:04:51,070
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

51
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:54,372
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was addressed to Sakura Kasugano.

52
00:04:55,633 --> 00:04:56,734
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know what listener sent that to you?

53
00:04:57,758 --> 00:05:05,055
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm trying to remember, I've got the box right here, but I didn't put the name on it, just his real name.

54
00:05:07,529 --> 00:05:08,269
[SPEAKER_03]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

55
00:05:29,122 --> 00:05:30,102
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Fred.

56
00:05:53,532 --> 00:05:57,697
[SPEAKER_03]: Siv4 I got from X-Link and I got the same Steam game you did.

57
00:05:57,917 --> 00:05:59,880
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that was... Okay.

58
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,684
[SPEAKER_09]: Because, yeah, I've been meaning to try it out.

59
00:06:03,585 --> 00:06:04,606
[SPEAKER_09]: I started school last week.

60
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:10,474
[SPEAKER_09]: So, of course, there goes... I play Peggle at Fuddruckers.

61
00:06:11,584 --> 00:06:12,804
[SPEAKER_03]: When they ruin my order!

62
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:15,845
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me go into our chatroom at chat.orangelandstreetie.com.

63
00:06:16,145 --> 00:06:20,886
[SPEAKER_03]: Dark Kiske is in chat trying to take responsibility for sending it to you, but said JK.

64
00:06:21,627 --> 00:06:25,868
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, Dark Tetsuya says, I don't know what my favorite Sega Master System game is.

65
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:29,469
[SPEAKER_03]: Toss up between the Ghostbusters port and Astro Warrior.

66
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:35,650
[SPEAKER_03]: Was the Ghostbusters port on Sega Master System the same one that was on Commodore 64 and the computers back in the early 80s?

67
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:37,591
[SPEAKER_03]: Or is that a different Ghostbusters game?

68
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,673
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you the gatekeeper?

69
00:06:55,327 --> 00:06:57,669
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is the last semester of school for you, right?

70
00:06:57,709 --> 00:06:59,310
[SPEAKER_03]: You graduate away this year?

71
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:01,612
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, not forever the last semester.

72
00:07:01,732 --> 00:07:04,194
[SPEAKER_03]: You've been in school since the show started.

73
00:07:04,515 --> 00:07:06,196
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you know why, and I've got to say this.

74
00:07:06,456 --> 00:07:09,158
[SPEAKER_03]: There's nothing wrong with always wanting to enrich the mind.

75
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:16,464
[SPEAKER_09]: I spent way too much time doing what everyone else said that I should do instead of doing what I love, and now I just said, fuck it, I'm doing what I love.

76
00:07:17,505 --> 00:07:23,770
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm going to graduate with my AA, and I'm going to do a year of the rest of my gen ed for...

77
00:07:24,751 --> 00:07:27,373
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm actually kind of thinking of not going to Sac State, maybe going to UC Davis.

78
00:07:28,514 --> 00:07:31,176
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll be a drive, but I might get a better education out of it.

79
00:07:31,397 --> 00:07:34,639
[SPEAKER_03]: So you'd say the life lesson you learned is that you should go to school to study what you love?

80
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:35,300
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

81
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,582
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I major in pornography in college?

82
00:07:38,963 --> 00:07:39,223
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob.

83
00:07:39,563 --> 00:07:39,743
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

84
00:07:40,524 --> 00:07:46,649
[SPEAKER_09]: My point is that when you find something that you can make a living out of that you love, go for it.

85
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:49,731
[SPEAKER_03]: I also love food, but I can't cook.

86
00:07:50,112 --> 00:07:52,173
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know what to do.

87
00:07:52,233 --> 00:07:54,736
[SPEAKER_09]: You could actually take journalism classes and be a food critic.

88
00:07:56,637 --> 00:07:57,658
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that's a good idea.

89
00:07:58,459 --> 00:08:00,721
[SPEAKER_03]: Aren't all food critics fat?

90
00:08:01,101 --> 00:08:03,223
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't take offense if you're a food critic.

91
00:08:03,263 --> 00:08:04,063
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never known any.

92
00:08:04,464 --> 00:08:05,705
[SPEAKER_09]: You could have high metabolism.

93
00:08:06,205 --> 00:08:08,207
[SPEAKER_11]: But they're all pompous asses.

94
00:08:08,887 --> 00:08:12,891
[SPEAKER_11]: At least that's what I've gathered from watching the Food Network.

95
00:08:13,691 --> 00:08:17,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, on Iron Chef America, Julie Chan is a food critic and she's my hero.

96
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:22,653
[SPEAKER_09]: We should do a one-off side podcast that's called Fat Butt.

97
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:27,834
[SPEAKER_09]: And talk about all the food we love that makes our butts fat.

98
00:08:27,854 --> 00:08:29,414
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what Alan calls me, actually.

99
00:08:29,674 --> 00:08:30,815
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

100
00:08:31,415 --> 00:08:32,675
[SPEAKER_03]: I could be the host, Fat Butt.

101
00:08:32,975 --> 00:08:34,635
[SPEAKER_09]: He shouldn't call you Fat Butt.

102
00:08:34,715 --> 00:08:35,456
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm making that up.

103
00:08:35,496 --> 00:08:36,876
[SPEAKER_09]: He should call you Plump Booty.

104
00:08:37,456 --> 00:08:38,396
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to get into it.

105
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:39,736
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, my nickname is Fat Kitty.

106
00:08:40,397 --> 00:08:42,377
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to get into that.

107
00:08:44,514 --> 00:08:49,083
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna get a text message in 5, 4, 3, STOP TALKING!

108
00:08:51,187 --> 00:08:54,994
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, anyhow, if that's it for DarkSakura's Gaming Week, Loki, how was your Gaming Week?

109
00:08:55,841 --> 00:08:56,862
[SPEAKER_11]: It was okay.

110
00:08:56,942 --> 00:09:07,928
[SPEAKER_11]: Didn't really play a lot except for on Friday where we did this kind of company sales team building thing where we went to Dave & Buster's and played some games.

111
00:09:09,249 --> 00:09:17,914
[SPEAKER_11]: The whole team building portion of that event was kind of dumb because they have this arcade full of wonderful games and they put you on all the old...

112
00:09:18,274 --> 00:09:19,456
[SPEAKER_11]: All the really crappy games.

113
00:09:19,556 --> 00:09:23,400
[SPEAKER_11]: Except for, say, Rallying Classic, which is better known as Daytona.

114
00:09:24,001 --> 00:09:25,422
[SPEAKER_11]: Sans License, you know.

115
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:27,625
[SPEAKER_11]: And that was fun.

116
00:09:28,005 --> 00:09:32,791
[SPEAKER_11]: But the person that was kind of... They had us split up into groups of four, so we were all teams of four.

117
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:39,352
[SPEAKER_11]: And the guy that was in charge of our three teams of four was an idiot.

118
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:47,654
[SPEAKER_11]: And instead of putting three people up each round to have them go head-to-head against each team, they just had each team compete against themselves.

119
00:09:47,974 --> 00:09:55,335
[SPEAKER_11]: And because of that and his horrible scorekeeping, we ended up near last place because he was a complete idiot.

120
00:09:55,435 --> 00:09:57,976
[SPEAKER_11]: Not that it matters because it was just for fun, but whatever.

121
00:09:58,316 --> 00:09:59,136
[SPEAKER_11]: It's still a waste of time.

122
00:09:59,876 --> 00:10:02,537
[SPEAKER_11]: I did, though, play some arcade games.

123
00:10:02,557 --> 00:10:05,098
[SPEAKER_11]: I got to play the Rambo shooting game, which is kind of funny.

124
00:10:06,359 --> 00:10:08,420
[SPEAKER_11]: But, I mean, it's just kind of... They have that at Golf Land, too.

125
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,600
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you play the Terminator one?

126
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:10,781
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that one's actually really fun.

127
00:10:10,881 --> 00:10:13,942
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I did walk past it a bunch of times, and that looked really cool.

128
00:10:13,982 --> 00:10:14,582
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's hard.

129
00:10:15,322 --> 00:10:16,943
[SPEAKER_11]: But I just didn't get a chance to do that.

130
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:18,404
[SPEAKER_11]: There are so many pretty games there.

131
00:10:18,504 --> 00:10:22,945
[SPEAKER_11]: But I actually played some DDR, played DDRX, and I...

132
00:10:25,384 --> 00:10:26,485
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

133
00:10:47,822 --> 00:10:51,843
[SPEAKER_11]: How that works is beyond me, but that's what happens.

134
00:10:51,863 --> 00:10:53,404
[SPEAKER_11]: So I played some doubles on that.

135
00:10:53,464 --> 00:10:56,685
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't really care for the new stage that they have.

136
00:10:56,745 --> 00:11:04,727
[SPEAKER_11]: It looks really cheap because it's all one single sheet of metal that they have in there instead of all the little panels, which are really cool looking.

137
00:11:05,427 --> 00:11:06,348
[SPEAKER_11]: But, yeah, whatever.

138
00:11:06,408 --> 00:11:08,188
[SPEAKER_11]: And the spacing's a little different.

139
00:11:09,469 --> 00:11:10,689
[SPEAKER_11]: But that's minor.

140
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:11,729
[SPEAKER_11]: Um...

141
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:14,670
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see, what else?

142
00:11:15,871 --> 00:11:18,692
[SPEAKER_11]: I played a game called Tank, Tank, Tank, which is kind of fun.

143
00:11:19,152 --> 00:11:20,713
[SPEAKER_09]: Which mission did you do?

144
00:11:21,573 --> 00:11:22,834
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you do the giant monster mission?

145
00:11:24,594 --> 00:11:26,975
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, we just played Versus, so... Oh, no.

146
00:11:27,095 --> 00:11:31,577
[SPEAKER_09]: Next time you play that, you have to do co-op and play against the giant bees.

147
00:11:32,537 --> 00:11:33,338
[SPEAKER_09]: And the giant squid.

148
00:11:33,938 --> 00:11:34,798
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the building mecha.

149
00:11:34,838 --> 00:11:35,899
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you were telling me about this game.

150
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:37,479
[SPEAKER_09]: This game is so much fun!

151
00:11:37,499 --> 00:11:38,980
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Tank versus Bees.

152
00:11:39,740 --> 00:12:07,462
[SPEAKER_09]: that's strange you can either choose versus or you know two tanks versus two other tanks or you can go against the evil robot hordes and so you get like these big missiles with grinny faces on them they're so fantastic I don't know bees are pretty fucking terrible I call them mecha bees but yeah tank tank tank was pretty fun and there was some other game that we played it was kind of like track mania the arcade game almost and that was alright what else did I play there

153
00:12:09,964 --> 00:12:10,745
[SPEAKER_11]: That was about it.

154
00:12:10,825 --> 00:12:12,206
[SPEAKER_11]: I just played a lot of DDR.

155
00:12:13,227 --> 00:12:15,509
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not very in shape anymore.

156
00:12:17,411 --> 00:12:26,078
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been a while since I played DDR, but I actually did play A on doubles on, I guess it's called Expert now, which is like an 11-footer.

157
00:12:27,539 --> 00:12:42,667
[SPEAKER_11]: and I passed it but oh my god I felt like crap afterwards of course now that I think of it I don't think there's ever been a time they played a and doubles on heavy or whatever that actually didn't feel like crap afterwards so that's fine did you go right into playing a hard song

158
00:12:44,135 --> 00:12:45,156
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, no, that was my last song.

159
00:12:45,236 --> 00:12:50,019
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually played... Still, just in one game, you played, you know, wow.

160
00:12:50,119 --> 00:12:52,161
[SPEAKER_11]: You ever heard of a warm-up?

161
00:12:52,861 --> 00:12:54,562
[SPEAKER_11]: I did play warm-up stuff.

162
00:12:54,903 --> 00:12:59,666
[SPEAKER_11]: It was really tiring me out, though, because I'm not used to it anymore.

163
00:12:59,766 --> 00:13:08,252
[SPEAKER_11]: So I was playing, you know, some of the new songs that were in there were kind of dumb, so I didn't really care for the new DDRX songs, I guess.

164
00:13:10,253 --> 00:13:38,392
[SPEAKER_11]: I played a few actually a few times I played Hysteria because I liked one of the patterns for I guess it was the I don't even know what they call it now the second setting it would have been trick I don't remember they change them all just to change them it's just annoying whatever red difficulty right yes the medium difficulty I like the double pattern for that so that was fun and then I was trying to remember like I remember there was

165
00:13:40,134 --> 00:13:53,233
[SPEAKER_11]: you know 20 November I know if you play that on I think heavy and little that like makes no notes for like quite a while that would have been fun also there's another one that was like that

166
00:13:54,722 --> 00:14:11,034
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, so, played a few rounds of that, and that was fun, um, and then, of course, you know, Redemption stuff, played some Deal or No Deal, because, I mean, that game was super easy, um, but yeah, so now, it was funny, because I had a bunch of Dave and Buster power cards from, like,

167
00:14:11,594 --> 00:14:17,998
[SPEAKER_11]: Back when we went to our first E3, like when we went to Irvine, you know, and went to that Dave & Buster's, I had a card from that.

168
00:14:18,018 --> 00:14:20,279
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow, that was a long time ago.

169
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:29,685
[SPEAKER_11]: I had one from when we went to Milpitas one time, and so I combined that together with one that they gave us to use during this competition.

170
00:14:30,025 --> 00:14:35,749
[SPEAKER_11]: Then I got another one from them later on, so I have like a bunch of credits at Dave & Buster's right now.

171
00:14:35,769 --> 00:14:37,730
[SPEAKER_11]: I just haven't gotten a chance to use them.

172
00:14:38,070 --> 00:15:06,256
[SPEAKER_11]: but it's not bad it's a small one compared to the other ones and they even said though like because the people are reps at Dave and Buster's they said it's one of the I think it's the smallest one that they have which is kind of lame but whatever it's nice to at least have one they should put another one in Folsom though I definitely agree that because there's nothing in Folsom and it's kind of weird that they put Dave and Buster's like right next to Golf Land and right down the street from you know John's Incredible Pizza you know all these different like fun land places it's weird they're right there

173
00:15:06,636 --> 00:15:10,279
[SPEAKER_11]: And then, of course, other than that, Grand Theft Auto Lost and Damned.

174
00:15:10,299 --> 00:15:11,480
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been playing a lot more of that.

175
00:15:11,941 --> 00:15:12,781
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's still fun.

176
00:15:12,801 --> 00:15:14,002
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm working on mod stuff.

177
00:15:14,343 --> 00:15:21,349
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of annoying, though, because I'm sure not a lot of people are familiar with the Grand Theft Auto console modding community.

178
00:15:21,729 --> 00:15:24,711
[SPEAKER_11]: But they're very, I don't know, very...

179
00:15:27,591 --> 00:15:29,012
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know what the word would be for it.

180
00:15:29,032 --> 00:15:31,333
[SPEAKER_11]: They're dicks, I guess.

181
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:35,835
[SPEAKER_11]: It's because they figure out something and they kind of hold it above everybody's head.

182
00:15:36,315 --> 00:15:41,418
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I figured out something, so I posted about it because, you know, it's kind of cool.

183
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:42,498
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought I'd share something.

184
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:50,683
[SPEAKER_11]: And so now they're saying, oh, well, we did the same thing and we're not going to tell you guys how to do it until a while from now.

185
00:15:50,703 --> 00:15:52,704
[SPEAKER_11]: So I posted in that same thread how to do it.

186
00:15:53,124 --> 00:15:54,344
[SPEAKER_11]: And they went and deleted my post.

187
00:15:54,665 --> 00:15:55,765
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, you motherfuckers.

188
00:15:56,085 --> 00:15:57,346
[SPEAKER_11]: So I got to release something.

189
00:15:57,586 --> 00:15:58,327
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, what is this?

190
00:15:59,087 --> 00:16:01,949
[SPEAKER_11]: It's modding the game.

191
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:09,955
[SPEAKER_11]: I figured out how to change the maps, and actually I figured out how to change where different cars spawn and stuff like that.

192
00:16:09,975 --> 00:16:11,196
[SPEAKER_11]: Make your own website.

193
00:16:11,376 --> 00:16:13,598
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I don't even give a crap.

194
00:16:13,618 --> 00:16:14,799
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, all you do...

195
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,981
[SPEAKER_03]: Post an Orange Lounge Radio story.

196
00:16:18,021 --> 00:16:18,621
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really easy.

197
00:16:18,661 --> 00:16:20,162
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll send you the PDF that Dekeman made.

198
00:16:20,503 --> 00:16:22,664
[SPEAKER_03]: You post a news story to OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

199
00:16:22,724 --> 00:16:23,724
[SPEAKER_03]: Title of story.

200
00:16:23,945 --> 00:16:24,965
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the name of this website?

201
00:16:25,585 --> 00:16:26,266
[SPEAKER_03]: Seven Sins.

202
00:16:26,646 --> 00:16:27,787
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck Seven Sins.

203
00:16:28,007 --> 00:16:31,629
[SPEAKER_03]: And then post your hacks and all that stuff.

204
00:16:31,829 --> 00:16:33,230
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like high school drama.

205
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:34,331
[SPEAKER_11]: It's so pathetic.

206
00:16:35,131 --> 00:16:37,213
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a bunch of high schoolers, I hate to break it to ya

207
00:16:56,061 --> 00:17:00,222
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I already have a YouTube video out there of it, and so I'm all set.

208
00:17:00,342 --> 00:17:03,863
[SPEAKER_11]: I've got my bases covered, but it's just that, you know, these guys... Dibs.

209
00:17:04,343 --> 00:17:05,183
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki has dibs.

210
00:17:05,303 --> 00:17:15,525
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just, like, they sent me a private message that says, don't worry, we'll give you, you know, we're crediting you for indirectly coming up with this idea.

211
00:17:15,545 --> 00:17:16,545
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, indirectly?

212
00:17:16,825 --> 00:17:19,266
[SPEAKER_11]: I directly came up with this fucking idea, stupid.

213
00:17:20,746 --> 00:17:21,527
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't mean to be rude but...

214
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:41,783
[SPEAKER_11]: I just have problems people taking credit for something I came up with.

215
00:17:42,263 --> 00:17:52,567
[SPEAKER_11]: The whole point was I was just trying to give them an idea because all the stuff that they have out there right now, hacks, is just people editing the lines for the handling of the cars and stuff like that.

216
00:17:52,587 --> 00:17:53,827
[SPEAKER_11]: So, oh, look, this car's fast.

217
00:17:53,887 --> 00:17:56,388
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, look, this car crashes through things.

218
00:17:56,488 --> 00:17:57,508
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, this one flies.

219
00:17:57,648 --> 00:17:58,709
[SPEAKER_11]: Big fucking whoop.

220
00:17:59,449 --> 00:18:03,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, I gotta take a sidetrack here to read some of the chat comments because they've been accumulating here.

221
00:18:03,933 --> 00:18:06,556
[SPEAKER_03]: SpazinatorPSN is talking about that Tank Tank Tank game.

222
00:18:06,576 --> 00:18:12,001
[SPEAKER_03]: It says, when you beat Tank Tank Tank and watch the credits, it says, tanks for playing!

223
00:18:13,021 --> 00:18:13,281
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

224
00:18:13,561 --> 00:18:13,942
[SPEAKER_03]: Get it?

225
00:18:14,602 --> 00:18:14,982
[SPEAKER_03]: Haha.

226
00:18:16,023 --> 00:18:21,206
[SPEAKER_03]: See, remember earlier I was talking about food and porn and all that and what we should major in in school?

227
00:18:21,807 --> 00:18:25,970
[SPEAKER_03]: SatelliteMinded in chat says, Rob should combine food and porn and make a living from that.

228
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:32,354
[SPEAKER_03]: And Ranma follows that up with a website called www.foodporndaily.com, which I'd never heard of, but...

229
00:18:33,129 --> 00:18:35,430
[SPEAKER_03]: Yum, all you do is you click on pictures of food.

230
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:39,452
[SPEAKER_03]: Like this one is mac and cheese with bacon and chicken.

231
00:18:40,092 --> 00:18:41,032
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I click it again.

232
00:18:42,053 --> 00:18:44,273
[SPEAKER_03]: Mmm, pork chops with parsley.

233
00:18:44,894 --> 00:18:45,434
[SPEAKER_03]: Yum.

234
00:18:46,374 --> 00:18:48,275
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just food porn.

235
00:18:49,455 --> 00:18:50,876
[SPEAKER_03]: Mmm, salmon sliders.

236
00:18:51,156 --> 00:18:52,517
[SPEAKER_03]: What about this is why you're fat?

237
00:18:53,677 --> 00:18:57,839
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of that stuff makes me ew, but this is like classy porn.

238
00:18:58,319 --> 00:18:58,419
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

239
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:08,783
[SPEAKER_09]: This is more like... It's the difference between an escort and a 20-buck prostitute.

240
00:19:09,263 --> 00:19:10,743
[SPEAKER_03]: This is like Cinemax.

241
00:19:11,604 --> 00:19:14,005
[SPEAKER_03]: Right here, the food porn daily is like Cinemax.

242
00:19:14,385 --> 00:19:16,305
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is why your fat.com is like Hustler.

243
00:19:16,566 --> 00:19:18,726
[SPEAKER_03]: That's basically the difference between the two.

244
00:19:19,387 --> 00:19:19,747
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

245
00:19:20,687 --> 00:19:21,247
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, anyhow.

246
00:19:21,307 --> 00:19:22,728
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else for your gaming week, Loki?

247
00:19:22,868 --> 00:19:23,088
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

248
00:19:23,764 --> 00:19:24,545
[SPEAKER_11]: No, that's really it.

249
00:19:24,885 --> 00:19:28,406
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just glad, though, my dev kit's coming next week.

250
00:19:28,606 --> 00:19:33,249
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm excited to see how that kind of works out for you.

251
00:19:33,529 --> 00:19:35,550
[SPEAKER_03]: Curious how that plays or whatever.

252
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:35,910
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

253
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:36,450
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

254
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:38,091
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see my gaming week.

255
00:19:38,731 --> 00:19:40,212
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been playing... Oh, real quick.

256
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:40,812
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, fine.

257
00:19:41,132 --> 00:19:41,872
[SPEAKER_03]: Not my gaming week.

258
00:19:42,473 --> 00:19:43,733
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just a story, real quick.

259
00:19:43,873 --> 00:19:44,674
[SPEAKER_11]: This is funny.

260
00:19:44,854 --> 00:19:45,214
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

261
00:19:46,014 --> 00:19:51,677
[SPEAKER_11]: I experienced on my way over to the show today what I would consider white trash karaoke.

262
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,500
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

263
00:20:11,525 --> 00:20:14,909
[SPEAKER_03]: Please tell me she's singing like, you know, Kesha or something.

264
00:20:15,349 --> 00:20:17,912
[SPEAKER_03]: Wake up in the morning feeling like we did it.

265
00:20:18,072 --> 00:20:22,317
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like some country western song or something, but it was awful.

266
00:20:22,457 --> 00:20:24,279
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, why would you blast that?

267
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:31,927
[SPEAKER_11]: Seriously, I thought they were having like a party or something, but no, it's just this one chick apparently wanting to annoy the neighbors.

268
00:20:31,947 --> 00:20:32,747
[SPEAKER_11]: She wants to be famous.

269
00:20:34,029 --> 00:20:34,429
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

270
00:20:34,689 --> 00:20:36,190
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I actually will start off.

271
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:41,154
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a completely, like, doesn't have anything to do with gaming story, but I had a very strange weekend, okay?

272
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:45,617
[SPEAKER_03]: I was actually supposed to be going to LA this weekend, but I didn't end up going.

273
00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:52,902
[SPEAKER_03]: And part of the reason why I didn't end up going is that I was scheduled to take a flight on JetBlue from Sacramento to Long Beach.

274
00:20:53,203 --> 00:20:56,965
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that's, you know, probably one of the easiest ways to get to LA, and JetBlue is a fine airline.

275
00:20:56,985 --> 00:20:58,887
[SPEAKER_03]: You can watch TV in the back seats and everything.

276
00:20:59,868 --> 00:21:21,449
[SPEAKER_03]: So we get to the airport, we're sitting there waiting for our flight to go, and suddenly they come on the intercom and say, well, your plane had to evacuate, there was an emergency, the brakes caught fire, and sure enough, we're looking out the window and there's this plane sitting there on the runway and the slides are all inflated and all these people are standing out kind of looking.

277
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:41,446
[SPEAKER_03]: and yeah if you heard about that because it was kind of a big deal it was on like CNN and stuff yeah I was supposed to be on that plane so I was sitting there in the terminal while that plane was landing waiting to board it so yeah that was kind of a day ruiner we tried to catch another flight that was seven hours later in Oakland but we were like okay well at least we'll still get to go to LA at some point

278
00:21:42,387 --> 00:22:03,662
[SPEAKER_03]: and then uh yeah that flight ended up getting delayed for about three and a half hours because the whole system was backed up and that's about the point where we said fuck it because a we could have just driven there faster b we were going to lose our rental car and all this other stuff and it was kind of annoying so uh kind of a bummer but yeah just a completely random story because you know it's it's not every day that you're sitting right in front of national news unfolding before your eyes

279
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:04,423
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

280
00:22:21,081 --> 00:22:21,662
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty cool.

281
00:22:21,702 --> 00:22:23,983
[SPEAKER_03]: How much did they pair?

282
00:22:25,825 --> 00:22:23,983
$75.

283
00:22:26,145 --> 00:22:35,573
[SPEAKER_03]: She was thinking she probably could have got more, but at the same time, at a moment like that, you're not thinking, oh, I want to take a picture so I can sell it.

284
00:22:36,433 --> 00:22:39,216
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was more of a novelty thing.

285
00:22:39,256 --> 00:22:41,858
[SPEAKER_03]: How many people can say they've sold a picture to the Associated Press?

286
00:22:42,558 --> 00:22:44,200
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not an everyday occurrence.

287
00:22:46,081 --> 00:22:49,684
[SPEAKER_03]: I think she did it more for the novelty of it than for the actual money, and I can't say I blame her.

288
00:22:49,704 --> 00:22:50,585
[SPEAKER_03]: I would have done the same thing.

289
00:22:50,925 --> 00:22:57,749
[SPEAKER_03]: I took pictures too on Twitter, it's just that iPhone pictures don't have nearly the detail that she actually took them on a real camera.

290
00:22:57,789 --> 00:23:00,811
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why they wanted her pictures, because not a lot of people had that.

291
00:23:00,911 --> 00:23:03,353
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, kind of a weird weekend.

292
00:23:03,813 --> 00:23:05,654
[SPEAKER_03]: So, let's see.

293
00:23:06,154 --> 00:23:11,438
[SPEAKER_03]: Monty Boggs in our chatroom says, stuff like that happens in airlines, bitch, about how not enough people are flying.

294
00:23:11,858 --> 00:23:12,438
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what, though?

295
00:23:13,139 --> 00:23:19,002
[SPEAKER_03]: Not to get too far off the topic of games, except that I was supposed to be playing a bunch of them this weekend and didn't get to because of this.

296
00:23:19,642 --> 00:23:19,723
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

297
00:23:20,743 --> 00:23:48,613
[SPEAKER_03]: Monty Boggs the thing is though that every time something like this happens like okay the SAC airport is not that big of an airport but this was I'm sure on the news wherever it is you live I know this was on the news in like Connecticut it was on CNN it was on MSNBC nobody died nobody was severely hurt like a few people were taken to the hospital but it's because a lot of whiplash type conditions because of the breaking of the plane and apparently people got rug burns from sliding down those inflatable slides

298
00:23:49,153 --> 00:24:14,175
[SPEAKER_03]: and those were the injuries that people had so it's unfortunate and it sucks but I've seen car accidents that were tons worse and you don't hear about every single car accident so I still think flying is pretty safe all things considered I'm glad the brakes decided to go when they did and not an hour later because I would prefer to just have stayed at home all weekend and not be in the hospital in Long Beach being treated for burns because I had to take a trip down the slide

299
00:24:15,556 --> 00:24:18,737
[SPEAKER_03]: However, if I did have to go down the slide, I'd at least grab a beer first like that guy did.

300
00:24:19,777 --> 00:24:21,358
[SPEAKER_03]: Beer is great.

301
00:24:22,078 --> 00:24:23,378
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me talk about actual games.

302
00:24:23,918 --> 00:24:27,859
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to talk about that because national news being right in front of me doesn't happen every day.

303
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:29,900
[SPEAKER_03]: Games.

304
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:32,701
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been playing Warcraft, of course, still working on my characters.

305
00:24:32,741 --> 00:24:37,042
[SPEAKER_03]: We're about halfway through Icecrown Citadel, which is cool, and the whole guild's gearing up, and it's cool.

306
00:24:37,342 --> 00:24:39,562
[SPEAKER_03]: But Cataclysm really needs to be out now.

307
00:24:39,842 --> 00:24:40,963
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm ready for it.

308
00:24:41,043 --> 00:24:41,583
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we all are.

309
00:24:42,424 --> 00:24:43,465
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been playing more Starcraft 2.

310
00:24:43,965 --> 00:24:50,371
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been just trying to go after some of the achievements a little bit and just playing the campaign a little bit here and there.

311
00:24:50,391 --> 00:24:57,098
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm progressing very slowly through that game, but considering I didn't even want to play it at first, I'm surprisingly having a really good time with that.

312
00:24:57,618 --> 00:24:59,479
[SPEAKER_03]: I do have a couple new games I want to talk about this week.

313
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:03,680
[SPEAKER_03]: First off, out on PlayStation Network this week was an adaptation of Press Your Luck.

314
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,581
[SPEAKER_03]: This game has already come out on the PC and the Wii, and I think there's an iPhone version as well.

315
00:25:08,901 --> 00:25:14,142
[SPEAKER_03]: But it came out on PlayStation Network this week, and it was really the first chance I had to check it out.

316
00:25:14,222 --> 00:25:18,623
[SPEAKER_03]: I have the DVD game from a few years ago, which I believe Jamie actually gave me as a gift a couple years ago.

317
00:25:19,304 --> 00:25:19,864
[SPEAKER_03]: I have that.

318
00:25:19,944 --> 00:25:24,465
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really the only version of the game I have to compare it to, which you can't compare a video game to a DVD game.

319
00:25:24,585 --> 00:25:24,805
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

320
00:25:25,785 --> 00:25:44,711
[SPEAKER_03]: I never really played the Wii game I've only heard about it and I've only really heard about the PC game as well so I haven't really played them the PlayStation 1 it's okay like there's some really cool things and then there's some really not so cool things that really detract from it

321
00:25:45,151 --> 00:25:46,432
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

322
00:26:02,406 --> 00:26:05,928
[SPEAKER_03]: and then when you're actually playing the board sequences, it's a lot of fun.

323
00:26:06,148 --> 00:26:10,029
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, your character's actually going, big bucks, big bucks, no whammies.

324
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:14,831
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they're actually saying it and the whammy animations are actually really well done.

325
00:26:14,891 --> 00:26:16,432
[SPEAKER_03]: That's actually probably the best thing about the adaptation.

326
00:26:16,452 --> 00:26:17,312
[SPEAKER_09]: I saw some on the trailer.

327
00:26:17,492 --> 00:26:20,033
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the whammy, there's new stuff.

328
00:26:20,454 --> 00:26:23,035
[SPEAKER_03]: You know how there would always be pop culture tie-ins?

329
00:26:23,135 --> 00:26:29,737
[SPEAKER_03]: I always remember the little whammy that was like Boy George that would sing, do you really want a whammy?

330
00:26:32,785 --> 00:26:35,429
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why I remember this stuff from when I was like seven, okay?

331
00:26:36,069 --> 00:26:40,475
[SPEAKER_03]: But now they have like an American Idol whammy and some of these other like pop culture references and that's really cute.

332
00:26:40,495 --> 00:26:40,876
[SPEAKER_08]: That's cool.

333
00:26:41,757 --> 00:26:46,784
[SPEAKER_03]: But unfortunately, with these really high points, there's also a lot of like clunk.

334
00:26:49,266 --> 00:26:51,328
[SPEAKER_03]: The interface feels very clunky.

335
00:26:51,868 --> 00:26:58,334
[SPEAKER_03]: The shell around the game itself feels very rushed and just not flashy at all like a game show should be.

336
00:26:58,834 --> 00:27:00,896
[SPEAKER_03]: It feels very Facebook game to me.

337
00:27:01,736 --> 00:27:06,440
[SPEAKER_03]: The avatar designer is very disappointing, especially considering that you're playing on a PlayStation.

338
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,602
[SPEAKER_03]: Why can't you just bring in my avatar from home?

339
00:27:09,062 --> 00:27:14,003
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it has this whole system built into it, and maybe that's a Sony restriction, I don't know.

340
00:27:14,323 --> 00:27:16,704
[SPEAKER_03]: But it seems a little weird that you can't play with your actual avatars.

341
00:27:17,464 --> 00:27:22,885
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried to play the game online, could never find a room full of people to play it with, so didn't really get to test that.

342
00:27:24,485 --> 00:27:27,206
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think the questions in the game are really weird.

343
00:27:27,846 --> 00:27:31,767
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, it's just all the... There's no... You would think if I'm...

344
00:27:32,427 --> 00:27:34,948
[SPEAKER_03]: Press your luck on the PlayStation 3.

345
00:27:35,689 --> 00:27:41,092
[SPEAKER_03]: I would try to ask a lot of pop culture questions or questions geared towards 20 and 30 somethings.

346
00:27:41,132 --> 00:27:47,455
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's just a lot of like weird off the wall ancient history and obscure sports questions that seem to show up in there.

347
00:27:47,475 --> 00:27:48,416
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's kind of like, what?

348
00:27:48,916 --> 00:27:51,438
[SPEAKER_03]: Did they just go to a trivia book and yank all this shit out?

349
00:27:51,478 --> 00:27:51,998
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I don't know.

350
00:27:52,358 --> 00:28:09,734
[SPEAKER_03]: probably what they did and there's a really weird like the single player mode is like playing through 16 episodes and your goal is to try and win each episode but the computer opponents have these different quirks so yeah weird but at the end of the day the game's only $10 so here's my thought

351
00:28:10,234 --> 00:28:32,018
[SPEAKER_03]: if you're bringing people over and you want to have laughs and you have three controllers and you want to have a fun little night this makes for a good board game substitute I don't think there's any substitute for an awesome board game like Clue or Monopoly or Catan or something like that but this is a fun little alternative you know I don't think it's anything I would take too seriously beyond that that's that's basically it for Press Your Luck um

352
00:28:33,338 --> 00:28:38,901
[SPEAKER_03]: Another game I've been playing this week is Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light, which is one of the new games that's on Xbox 360.

353
00:28:39,981 --> 00:28:41,822
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just want to give disclosure up front here.

354
00:28:41,902 --> 00:28:48,745
[SPEAKER_03]: A friend of mine actually worked on this game, so you may want to take what I'm about to say with a grain of salt, but I assure you that bears nothing on my opinion of this game.

355
00:28:48,965 --> 00:28:52,767
[SPEAKER_09]: And if I may say so, it was covered in last month's Retro Gamer.

356
00:28:53,687 --> 00:28:54,108
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it?

357
00:28:54,168 --> 00:28:55,008
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's not a retro game.

358
00:28:55,028 --> 00:28:55,828
[SPEAKER_03]: It just came out this week.

359
00:28:56,389 --> 00:28:59,170
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it must be because of the Tomb Raider history or whatever, maybe.

360
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:03,092
[SPEAKER_03]: And there is a certain kind of retro-ish feeling about this game.

361
00:29:03,692 --> 00:29:07,814
[SPEAKER_03]: But as far as the game goes, I paid the $15 for it.

362
00:29:07,854 --> 00:29:08,795
[SPEAKER_03]: I played through the demo.

363
00:29:09,295 --> 00:29:12,036
[SPEAKER_03]: And I gotta say, it is awesome.

364
00:29:12,577 --> 00:29:16,719
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it is one of the better Xbox Live Arcade games to come out in a long time.

365
00:29:17,539 --> 00:29:18,080
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the thing.

366
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:22,364
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't really feel like Tomb Raider at all to me, and I think that's why they're not calling it Tomb Raider.

367
00:29:22,384 --> 00:29:27,810
[SPEAKER_03]: They're calling it this Lara Croft game, but I would honestly call it Gauntlet Legends is what it feels like more to me.

368
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:37,200
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very arcade-feely with the score and the way the maps are and the isometric, but it's a good time.

369
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:40,701
[SPEAKER_03]: I played through with Alan for about three hours on Friday night.

370
00:29:40,741 --> 00:29:44,743
[SPEAKER_03]: We were just kind of going through the different levels and the co-op is a lot of fun.

371
00:29:45,183 --> 00:29:47,784
[SPEAKER_03]: Like some of the puzzles are really cool.

372
00:29:47,844 --> 00:29:49,165
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there's all these different mechanics.

373
00:29:49,205 --> 00:29:58,568
[SPEAKER_03]: Like one of you plays as Lara Croft and she has a grappling hook that she can grab like little, I don't know, like little chains with.

374
00:29:58,608 --> 00:30:00,249
[SPEAKER_03]: She can grab them and then grapple over to them.

375
00:30:00,729 --> 00:30:16,239
[SPEAKER_03]: and then you can also play as Totec who is like an Aztec warrior and he can use a shield to either block projectiles or he can use the shield and hold it up and then Laura can jump on his shield or he can throw spears that then Laura can jump on.

376
00:30:16,599 --> 00:30:24,364
[SPEAKER_03]: So you really have to work together in order to be able to solve these different puzzles and it actually made for a lot of fun and we were kind of...

377
00:30:25,565 --> 00:30:50,303
[SPEAKER_03]: every level in that game it seems to end with this big climactic scene like for instance the end of the first level you think you're at the end and then all of a sudden the walls start to move and they they start to move in and it's going to push you over into the pit of spikes if you don't think quickly and you really have to work together like you have to jump up then you have to have Totec throw a spear you jump on the spear jump up use your grappling hook to grab Totec bring him up I mean it's

378
00:30:50,643 --> 00:30:53,546
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds complicated the way I'm saying it, but it's all very fluid.

379
00:30:53,726 --> 00:30:57,070
[SPEAKER_03]: And the way it plays out, it executes a lot of fun.

380
00:30:57,110 --> 00:31:01,594
[SPEAKER_03]: And Alan and I are kind of yelling back and forth at each other like, no, no, no, do this, do this, do this.

381
00:31:01,834 --> 00:31:04,857
[SPEAKER_03]: And we actually fell in the spikes and died one time because we didn't have it together.

382
00:31:04,897 --> 00:31:06,319
[SPEAKER_03]: But then we figured it out the next time.

383
00:31:07,253 --> 00:31:08,274
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

384
00:31:31,512 --> 00:31:39,178
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know the rhyme or reason for that, but honestly, I was playing it in-house, and it was fine, and we had a lot of fun.

385
00:31:39,498 --> 00:31:44,402
[SPEAKER_03]: I could see, though, where it's really lacking if you had somebody you wanted to play with, but that'll be fixed in a couple weeks, I guess.

386
00:31:45,603 --> 00:31:50,807
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the other thing is that—oh, there's something else.

387
00:31:50,827 --> 00:31:52,308
[SPEAKER_03]: There's another drawback I was trying to think of.

388
00:31:53,635 --> 00:31:54,356
[SPEAKER_03]: Character models are nice.

389
00:32:09,133 --> 00:32:34,869
[SPEAKER_03]: and the single player mode what they do they give Laura the spear and then they alter some of the puzzles so that you can still do everything by yourself and I found myself playing through the first level like seven times this afternoon because there's all these different little mini objectives and one of them is a speed objective clear the level as fast as you can and there are lots of little shortcuts you have to take one of them is a points objective take it slow kill everything get all the points grab the diamonds

390
00:32:35,209 --> 00:32:38,432
[SPEAKER_03]: So it gives a lot of different reasons to replay the game.

391
00:32:38,772 --> 00:32:41,454
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it's absolutely worth checking out.

392
00:32:41,494 --> 00:32:49,021
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's one of the better games to come out in a while and makes me excited about Tomb Raider games again, which I never thought I'd say since like 1997.

393
00:32:49,541 --> 00:32:51,603
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you feel all tingly and brand new?

394
00:32:52,765 --> 00:32:53,285
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess so.

395
00:32:54,166 --> 00:32:58,128
[SPEAKER_03]: But I guess they're reinvigorating the regular franchise too and if it's anything like this it's going to be awesome.

396
00:32:58,408 --> 00:33:01,350
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I'm a big fan of Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light.

397
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:03,151
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely check out the demo if nothing else.

398
00:33:03,191 --> 00:33:06,933
[SPEAKER_03]: Demo's the first level and it'll give you a feel for the game.

399
00:33:07,373 --> 00:33:11,255
[SPEAKER_03]: Salacious Pop is in chat and actually says that would give home some purpose.

400
00:33:11,536 --> 00:33:12,236
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't have that.

401
00:33:12,276 --> 00:33:16,838
[SPEAKER_03]: That's in reference to the avatars on PlayStation 3 Press Your Luck.

402
00:33:17,839 --> 00:33:18,319
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

403
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:23,303
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, chat.orangelandradio.com if you want to join us in our chat room and give your own comments.

404
00:33:23,784 --> 00:33:26,666
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get into some housekeeping tonight and then we'll get into some actual gaming news.

405
00:33:26,966 --> 00:33:27,767
[SPEAKER_03]: Housekeeping tonight.

406
00:33:28,087 --> 00:33:29,588
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been talking about a marathon episode.

407
00:33:29,648 --> 00:33:32,631
[SPEAKER_03]: It was brought up last week and we were kind of joking like, should we really do this?

408
00:33:33,191 --> 00:33:33,791
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to do it.

409
00:33:34,031 --> 00:33:38,053
[SPEAKER_03]: We are going to do a long extended marathon episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

410
00:33:38,453 --> 00:33:42,995
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to start next week live at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.

411
00:33:43,015 --> 00:33:46,757
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to start at 2 o'clock Pacific, 5 o'clock Eastern.

412
00:33:46,797 --> 00:33:48,278
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a little bit earlier than usual.

413
00:33:48,338 --> 00:33:49,418
[SPEAKER_08]: And 10 o'clock in London.

414
00:33:49,578 --> 00:33:49,998
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

415
00:33:50,058 --> 00:33:55,201
[SPEAKER_03]: So this also is kind of that, those of you overseas that have been wanting to listen, here's your chance.

416
00:33:56,221 --> 00:34:01,084
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to go for two to five with our normal show, quote unquote.

417
00:34:01,384 --> 00:34:04,545
[SPEAKER_03]: And then after that, we're going to just keep going into the wee morning hours.

418
00:34:04,585 --> 00:34:05,766
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to go into the vault.

419
00:34:05,786 --> 00:34:09,568
[SPEAKER_03]: We're getting some extensions from the mic so we can actually go into the vault, play some old classic games.

420
00:34:09,808 --> 00:34:13,550
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to field a lot of comments from our chat room and kind of the listeners.

421
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:16,872
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to know some discussion topics you want to talk about during that time.

422
00:34:17,372 --> 00:34:18,513
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be kind of asking you guys.

423
00:34:18,853 --> 00:34:22,495
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, unfortunately, because of, you know, the baby and the wife and everything, he's only going to be here for the...

424
00:34:23,095 --> 00:34:23,435
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura

425
00:34:51,056 --> 00:34:51,316
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

426
00:34:52,017 --> 00:34:52,817
[SPEAKER_03]: As late as it can.

427
00:34:53,698 --> 00:34:55,559
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's see.

428
00:34:55,619 --> 00:34:57,840
[SPEAKER_03]: Ranma says, woohoo, time to alcohol down.

429
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:01,022
[SPEAKER_03]: We are actually thinking about doing at the top of every hour.

430
00:35:01,162 --> 00:35:02,283
[SPEAKER_03]: It's happy hour somewhere.

431
00:35:02,823 --> 00:35:07,125
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll actually take a drink of whatever country it happens to be happy hour in.

432
00:35:07,165 --> 00:35:08,386
[SPEAKER_03]: So tune in.

433
00:35:08,426 --> 00:35:09,186
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be a good time.

434
00:35:09,627 --> 00:35:09,967
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

435
00:35:10,563 --> 00:35:13,125
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, I think that's it for housekeeping.

436
00:35:13,205 --> 00:35:13,966
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have a whole lot else.

437
00:35:14,086 --> 00:35:14,847
[SPEAKER_03]: Add us on Facebook.

438
00:35:14,887 --> 00:35:16,629
[SPEAKER_03]: Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

439
00:35:16,649 --> 00:35:17,369
[SPEAKER_03]: We're also on Twitter.

440
00:35:17,409 --> 00:35:18,650
[SPEAKER_03]: Twitter.com slash OLR.

441
00:35:19,071 --> 00:35:20,973
[SPEAKER_03]: Visit our website at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

442
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:25,076
[SPEAKER_03]: There's been a few forum posts over the past few weeks that have been nice and so on.

443
00:35:25,537 --> 00:35:27,058
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get into some actual gaming news now.

444
00:35:27,178 --> 00:35:29,000
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, what is going on in the gaming world?

445
00:35:29,721 --> 00:35:31,282
[SPEAKER_11]: Lots of stuff this week.

446
00:35:31,362 --> 00:35:33,144
[SPEAKER_11]: Starting off in this kind of...

447
00:35:34,104 --> 00:35:43,606
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a little frustrating for me because I had the opportunity to participate in this.

448
00:35:44,486 --> 00:35:54,329
[SPEAKER_11]: Unfortunately, due to emails being eaten by a spam filter, I missed out, I think.

449
00:35:55,169 --> 00:35:55,949
[SPEAKER_11]: I could be wrong, though.

450
00:35:56,809 --> 00:35:59,870
[SPEAKER_11]: But the Connect beta is starting right now.

451
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:12,755
[SPEAKER_11]: Apparently, if you are part of the Microsoft Connect program, which I am, you get the occasional survey and beta test announcements and that kind of stuff.

452
00:36:13,115 --> 00:36:36,950
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, they sent out invites to, I'm not sure if it's all the members or some of the members, but people are getting invites to the Kinect beta, which they would actually send them a Kinect motion camera, as well as some software to test out, and the new dashboard update that's going to be coming out this fall, which includes some other cool stuff, including some audio enhancements and stuff like that.

453
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:41,171
[SPEAKER_11]: So hopefully that means that everybody doesn't sound like a little kid.

454
00:36:41,231 --> 00:36:43,652
[SPEAKER_11]: It's weird.

455
00:36:44,752 --> 00:36:54,856
[SPEAKER_11]: Sometimes when I'm out sick or something, or I have to take time off for my wife or the kid or whatever, and I play against my coworkers at work, they sound like little kids over the mics.

456
00:36:56,456 --> 00:36:57,797
[SPEAKER_11]: Even though that's not what they sound like on...

457
00:37:00,077 --> 00:37:04,298
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just really weird how badly the audio is distorted.

458
00:37:04,358 --> 00:37:07,099
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm hoping that that actually gets better.

459
00:37:07,239 --> 00:37:09,899
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't the Kinect device, doesn't it have a microphone on it too?

460
00:37:09,919 --> 00:37:10,619
[SPEAKER_03]: It does, yeah.

461
00:37:10,659 --> 00:37:12,260
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this supposed to be able to capture the room noise?

462
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:12,720
[SPEAKER_03]: It does.

463
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:17,061
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe they're doing audio enhancements to kind of better, you know, for the room talking.

464
00:37:17,101 --> 00:37:22,702
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if I'm sitting way back on the couch and Kinect's all the way in the front of the room, like it's got to use a different type of audio sensory.

465
00:37:22,882 --> 00:37:31,771
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes and no, but the reason why they're doing the upgrade to that is before, it's kind of like how our radio station was before on Live 365 or even the podcast.

466
00:37:32,172 --> 00:37:38,278
[SPEAKER_11]: How before we were kind of catering towards low bandwidth, 64K type stuff.

467
00:37:38,358 --> 00:37:42,923
[SPEAKER_11]: Now they're updating that because most people have broadband and that's why.

468
00:37:42,983 --> 00:37:43,324
[SPEAKER_03]: I see.

469
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:45,085
[SPEAKER_11]: They have more bandwidth to play with.

470
00:37:45,946 --> 00:37:48,708
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you know, it might also be the closure of original Xbox.

471
00:37:49,988 --> 00:37:58,173
[SPEAKER_11]: That's possible, because it says basically that the basic codec had originally required just a 64K connection, and it's time for us to move on.

472
00:37:59,093 --> 00:38:08,699
[SPEAKER_11]: Especially if we want to think about broadening a crackly headset on top of your head, not what people think about when they're talking about popular entertainment.

473
00:38:09,419 --> 00:38:25,915
[SPEAKER_11]: and you know I agree the audio quality should be better so that I can actually hear what people are saying instead of just hearing mumbling because that's what I hear a lot of times yeah if you go back and listen to old episodes of Orange Lounge Radio I mean they're out there there's information on the forums just remember guys it was a very different show in 2002

474
00:38:26,716 --> 00:38:27,316
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

475
00:38:48,983 --> 00:38:58,317
[SPEAKER_11]: But basically, though, the beta testers will be getting, I guess, Connect Adventures, Connect Supports, and Connect Joyride beta versions of those as well.

476
00:38:58,538 --> 00:39:03,445
[SPEAKER_11]: And I do believe there's also a beta version of Dance Central as well that's being sent out because...

477
00:39:04,386 --> 00:39:07,048
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably the five song demo that's been circulating.

478
00:39:07,649 --> 00:39:09,370
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I think it's something similar to that.

479
00:39:10,251 --> 00:39:11,151
[SPEAKER_11]: So that'd be kind of cool.

480
00:39:11,192 --> 00:39:13,133
[SPEAKER_11]: And those are actually supposed to be sent out now.

481
00:39:13,914 --> 00:39:16,976
[SPEAKER_11]: You should have gotten an email letting you know that's going to happen.

482
00:39:17,777 --> 00:39:23,121
[SPEAKER_11]: Like I said, I didn't realize that I'd gotten this invite way back from like on the 8th.

483
00:39:23,782 --> 00:39:26,284
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just registered the other day.

484
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:43,593
[SPEAKER_11]: but I'm crossing my fingers because not everybody that registers gets into it and I've been let into other beta programs so it would be nice because one, I like getting stuff early and two, I don't want to have to necessarily pay for this especially now with the baby and everything.

485
00:39:43,994 --> 00:39:47,035
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, just in case, Loki, this is for you for missing out.

486
00:39:48,416 --> 00:39:51,300
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

487
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,181
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for that.

488
00:39:52,221 --> 00:39:52,742
[SPEAKER_03]: You're welcome.

489
00:39:52,782 --> 00:39:53,182
[SPEAKER_03]: Anytime.

490
00:39:53,242 --> 00:39:53,943
[SPEAKER_03]: What are friends for?

491
00:39:54,544 --> 00:39:57,027
[SPEAKER_03]: Go into our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

492
00:39:57,047 --> 00:40:04,357
[SPEAKER_03]: Tiger Claw says, Microsoft may improve the quality of the voice chat, but still have yet to improve the quality of the people behind the voice chat.

493
00:40:04,377 --> 00:40:04,997
[SPEAKER_11]: That is true.

494
00:40:05,638 --> 00:40:06,299
[SPEAKER_03]: It's true.

495
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:10,924
[SPEAKER_11]: You will be able to hear all the horrible insults from 12-year-olds in high fidelity now.

496
00:40:10,984 --> 00:40:17,872
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you can hear F star star K, N I star star star, F star G, and all those wonderful words.

497
00:40:17,892 --> 00:40:19,274
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be awesome, though.

498
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:20,215
Yeah.

499
00:40:20,495 --> 00:40:31,298
[SPEAKER_11]: You know how they have the really bad voice dubbing in those made-for-TV, or not even necessarily made-for-TV, but how they have the television cable-friendly versions of movies and stuff?

500
00:40:32,259 --> 00:40:40,161
[SPEAKER_11]: The really bad ones where they'll actually change words to hot dog or kazoo or some weird-ass word.

501
00:40:40,801 --> 00:40:45,503
[SPEAKER_11]: It would be funny if they had some sort of algorithm to detect what people are saying and to kind of do that on the fly.

502
00:40:45,863 --> 00:40:47,484
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, wasn't there a story?

503
00:40:47,744 --> 00:40:53,587
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it was some time ago, like a couple years ago, about a patent filed by... I want to say it was Microsoft.

504
00:40:54,367 --> 00:40:59,070
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a long time ago, but I want to say we talked about a story, because we had a good laugh at it, about that type of technology.

505
00:40:59,410 --> 00:41:02,291
[SPEAKER_03]: That it could actually understand the word fuck, and it would replace it.

506
00:41:02,611 --> 00:41:07,214
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know, like, part of me wants to say it came out the next week, that it was all a lie, it was a red herring, it was a joke, but...

507
00:41:07,794 --> 00:41:08,074
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

508
00:41:08,094 --> 00:41:09,816
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to say that story was out there for some reason.

509
00:41:09,836 --> 00:41:10,277
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a while ago.

510
00:41:10,317 --> 00:41:11,218
[SPEAKER_11]: It would be funny, though.

511
00:41:11,238 --> 00:41:14,441
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be interesting if this might be the implementation of such technology.

512
00:41:14,461 --> 00:41:15,162
[SPEAKER_03]: Nah, I doubt it.

513
00:41:15,402 --> 00:41:15,462
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh?

514
00:41:16,063 --> 00:41:17,064
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

515
00:41:17,124 --> 00:41:17,424
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

516
00:41:18,586 --> 00:41:20,808
[SPEAKER_03]: Shadowrunner in our chat says, People still have dial-up.

517
00:41:20,848 --> 00:41:21,629
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought that died.

518
00:41:21,989 --> 00:41:24,472
[SPEAKER_03]: And Actdeft says, Dial-up still exists, believe it or not.

519
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:25,933
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, a lot of people are still on dial-up.

520
00:41:25,953 --> 00:41:27,575
[SPEAKER_03]: My parents are still on dial-up.

521
00:41:27,915 --> 00:41:28,916
[SPEAKER_03]: They will not switch.

522
00:41:28,997 --> 00:41:30,038
[SPEAKER_03]: They say it's too expensive.

523
00:41:30,458 --> 00:41:32,881
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people live in the woods where everything is interrupted by trees

524
00:41:48,718 --> 00:42:14,301
[SPEAKER_03]: or something else to consider other countries like you know do you think some countries outside of America, Europe, Japan are as wired for I guess when I say Europe I mean Britain and the surrounding countries don't send your emails saying Europe is not a country but you know what I mean like a lot of those areas are regions if I should say are better wired for internet than others you know what I mean

525
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:21,985
[SPEAKER_03]: So if Xbox is going to kind of ramp up the connection you need, they're kind of giving the finger to these people, right?

526
00:42:22,005 --> 00:42:25,827
[SPEAKER_11]: Not really, because you can't really play on Xbox Live with dial-up.

527
00:42:27,384 --> 00:42:29,125
[SPEAKER_11]: So, who cares?

528
00:42:30,245 --> 00:42:32,926
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can play with, like, can't you play with the satellite link?

529
00:42:33,146 --> 00:42:37,348
[SPEAKER_03]: Which isn't, it's faster than dial-up, but it's definitely not as fast as cable or even DSL, right?

530
00:42:37,368 --> 00:42:43,090
[SPEAKER_11]: We may have connection issues, because that's just like playing on our work, you know, network.

531
00:42:43,451 --> 00:42:48,172
[SPEAKER_11]: The connection's not very quick, and we get a lot of disconnects because of that.

532
00:42:48,353 --> 00:42:51,134
[SPEAKER_11]: But, it still works when it works, you know.

533
00:42:52,114 --> 00:42:55,415
[SPEAKER_03]: Ranma in our chat says, most ISPs are offering cable modem service for $19.99.

534
00:42:56,055 --> 00:42:57,255
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

535
00:42:58,275 --> 00:42:59,315
[SPEAKER_03]: I probably believe you.

536
00:42:59,355 --> 00:43:01,136
[SPEAKER_03]: I probably should help my parents price this.

537
00:43:01,196 --> 00:43:08,557
[SPEAKER_03]: But I kind of secretly think that my mom is just telling my dad it's too expensive because she knows that if they buy it, he'll be on the internet all the time.

538
00:43:09,037 --> 00:43:12,998
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm also thinking my mother is starting to learn how to use the internet and use email.

539
00:43:13,038 --> 00:43:14,598
[SPEAKER_03]: So why wouldn't she want faster internet?

540
00:43:14,838 --> 00:43:15,179
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

541
00:43:15,539 --> 00:43:16,439
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess you'll have to ask them.

542
00:43:16,979 --> 00:43:17,359
[SPEAKER_03]: So there you go.

543
00:43:17,782 --> 00:43:19,283
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else about the Kinect program, Loki?

544
00:43:19,323 --> 00:43:20,384
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else to know?

545
00:43:20,464 --> 00:43:22,245
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, this is just around the corner at this point, right?

546
00:43:22,265 --> 00:43:22,926
[SPEAKER_03]: About two months away?

547
00:43:23,646 --> 00:43:25,788
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, the Kinect, yeah, is coming out November 4th.

548
00:43:25,888 --> 00:43:30,791
[SPEAKER_11]: The actual devices will be out as soon as Microsoft sends them out.

549
00:43:31,151 --> 00:43:32,032
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me ask this question.

550
00:43:32,092 --> 00:43:33,733
[SPEAKER_11]: Why are they doing a beta program for this?

551
00:43:33,773 --> 00:43:37,756
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems weird because we haven't heard of a lot of hardware beta tests.

552
00:43:37,796 --> 00:43:43,520
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the last one I can remember is the PlayStation 2 hard drive for Final Fantasy XI, but I don't hear of this a lot.

553
00:43:44,644 --> 00:43:47,796
[SPEAKER_11]: It's really kind of unusual for them to be doing a lot of these.

554
00:43:48,217 --> 00:43:49,141
[SPEAKER_11]: I would think it's just...

555
00:43:51,025 --> 00:43:52,025
[SPEAKER_11]: Word of mouth, maybe.

556
00:43:52,765 --> 00:43:54,246
[SPEAKER_11]: Getting people excited about it.

557
00:43:54,926 --> 00:44:00,787
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a vast amount of NDA items on there.

558
00:44:00,847 --> 00:44:07,249
[SPEAKER_11]: They're basically not wanting people to share what's included in the new dashboard update and all this stuff.

559
00:44:07,369 --> 00:44:10,509
[SPEAKER_11]: But people talk anyways, and I think that they realize that.

560
00:44:10,729 --> 00:44:14,670
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just kind of like, ooh, information I'm not supposed to know.

561
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:16,151
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm more interested now.

562
00:44:16,191 --> 00:44:17,391
[SPEAKER_11]: Instead of just

563
00:44:19,455 --> 00:44:22,678
[SPEAKER_11]: So the whole thing is just a marketing thing.

564
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:28,784
[SPEAKER_11]: But I'm sure at the same time, though, there is some troubleshooting stuff that they're probably doing.

565
00:44:29,405 --> 00:44:36,151
[SPEAKER_11]: Just seeing, hey, are there any bugs that we haven't thought of yet that maybe are in this that we could patch day one or something?

566
00:44:37,553 --> 00:44:38,274
[SPEAKER_11]: That kind of stuff.

567
00:44:38,894 --> 00:44:39,094
[SPEAKER_11]: But...

568
00:44:39,915 --> 00:44:41,636
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm curious how well that video chat works.

569
00:44:41,696 --> 00:44:42,396
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want one.

570
00:44:42,676 --> 00:44:43,117
[SPEAKER_11]: That's all.

571
00:44:43,477 --> 00:44:46,058
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I was actually kind of interested in the Kinect stuff.

572
00:44:46,718 --> 00:44:50,800
[SPEAKER_11]: The move I could care less about, but it would be kind of fun.

573
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:56,663
[SPEAKER_11]: I would like to try out Dance Masters before it comes out so I don't look like a total tool trying to play the game.

574
00:44:57,743 --> 00:44:58,364
[SPEAKER_03]: Good luck with that.

575
00:44:59,004 --> 00:45:02,786
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, you know, it's all...

576
00:45:04,153 --> 00:45:05,494
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I understand.

577
00:45:05,534 --> 00:45:06,474
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, there's a lot.

578
00:45:07,074 --> 00:45:12,656
[SPEAKER_11]: The thing is, when you look at choreographed dancing, it looks stupid if one person's doing it.

579
00:45:12,776 --> 00:45:16,538
[SPEAKER_11]: If a bunch of people are doing it at the same time, it looks cool because it's all in sync.

580
00:45:16,878 --> 00:45:18,879
[SPEAKER_11]: But when one person's doing it, it's not so cool.

581
00:45:19,219 --> 00:45:19,459
[SPEAKER_03]: You mean...

582
00:45:20,379 --> 00:45:37,015
[SPEAKER_03]: or Para Para Paradise exactly like one person playing that game usually looked a little bit ridiculous but when everybody would stand behind the machine doing the same dance like people would walk up like how do they know that what do they do what it's a cult that game is a cult it's a trap

583
00:45:37,976 --> 00:45:39,178
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, so that's the thing.

584
00:45:39,759 --> 00:45:42,943
[SPEAKER_11]: They're going to have the routines from the music videos for some of these songs.

585
00:45:43,684 --> 00:45:45,286
[SPEAKER_11]: And yeah, it'll be kind of cool.

586
00:45:45,306 --> 00:45:47,989
[SPEAKER_11]: You're going to have a bunch of people doing it.

587
00:45:48,070 --> 00:45:53,377
[SPEAKER_11]: But can you imagine a bunch of sober people doing this together?

588
00:45:53,837 --> 00:45:54,678
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't imagine that.

589
00:45:55,058 --> 00:45:58,842
[SPEAKER_11]: All I can imagine is, hey, I'm going to play Dance Masters, and everyone's going, ha ha, you look stupid.

590
00:45:58,862 --> 00:46:04,147
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what's going to be awesome is learning on Dance Central, let's say, how to dance to Poker Face.

591
00:46:04,167 --> 00:46:05,788
[SPEAKER_11]: Dance Central, I mean, not Dance Masters.

592
00:46:05,848 --> 00:46:07,390
[SPEAKER_11]: Dance Masters look stupid.

593
00:46:08,010 --> 00:46:08,391
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, whatever.

594
00:46:08,631 --> 00:46:11,273
[SPEAKER_03]: But let's say you learn the dance to, I don't know,

595
00:46:12,174 --> 00:46:13,355
[SPEAKER_03]: Poker Face Poker Face

596
00:46:33,351 --> 00:46:34,212
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

597
00:46:54,557 --> 00:46:55,457
[SPEAKER_03]: I digress.

598
00:46:55,617 --> 00:47:01,239
[SPEAKER_03]: I think any time you have a group of three or more all doing the same thing, no matter what it is, like in sync, it's going to be interesting.

599
00:47:01,979 --> 00:47:02,479
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it is.

600
00:47:02,899 --> 00:47:03,699
[SPEAKER_11]: At least... You look weird.

601
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:10,361
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, at least be... It kind of reminds me of when I used to go to the club a long time ago.

602
00:47:11,081 --> 00:47:19,384
[SPEAKER_11]: There was a guy that looked like he... It was literally like some grandpa dressed up like Michael Jackson doing stuff, and it didn't matter what he was doing.

603
00:47:19,644 --> 00:47:20,904
[SPEAKER_11]: It's interesting because you're like...

604
00:47:22,216 --> 00:47:24,017
[SPEAKER_11]: That's something I don't see every day.

605
00:47:24,238 --> 00:47:25,299
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's the other thing, too.

606
00:47:25,339 --> 00:47:26,660
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it'll get people's attention.

607
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:29,642
[SPEAKER_11]: And really, going to clubs, that's all what it's about.

608
00:47:29,742 --> 00:47:31,083
[SPEAKER_11]: It's getting people's attention.

609
00:47:31,403 --> 00:47:33,365
[SPEAKER_11]: Because, you know, that's what you crave.

610
00:47:34,046 --> 00:47:39,410
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how often you've been to gay bars, Loki, but that's like all the people there on the dance floor.

611
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:41,712
[SPEAKER_03]: All that old man in the thriller outfit.

612
00:47:41,772 --> 00:47:46,215
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, it takes a lot to stand out like that at a gay bar.

613
00:47:47,116 --> 00:47:47,837
[SPEAKER_03]: It really does.

614
00:47:50,178 --> 00:47:56,784
[SPEAKER_03]: The one I remember is this fierce old drag queen that used to wear a leotard looking like Jane Fonda out of the 1980s.

615
00:47:57,164 --> 00:47:59,627
[SPEAKER_03]: They used to do goth dancing to pop songs.

616
00:48:00,628 --> 00:48:02,069
[SPEAKER_03]: That was unique.

617
00:48:03,330 --> 00:48:04,191
[SPEAKER_03]: That is unique.

618
00:48:04,271 --> 00:48:08,335
[SPEAKER_03]: That's plenty of genres right there.

619
00:48:08,375 --> 00:48:08,855
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

620
00:48:10,377 --> 00:48:12,198
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, America's the melting pot, so...

621
00:48:16,339 --> 00:48:17,140
[SPEAKER_08]: That sounds divine.

622
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:24,583
[SPEAKER_11]: There will be interest in Dance Central because look at how well Just Dance did.

623
00:48:25,204 --> 00:48:26,924
[SPEAKER_11]: That came out of fucking nowhere.

624
00:48:27,385 --> 00:48:29,506
[SPEAKER_11]: Just Dance is top of the charts for weeks.

625
00:48:29,586 --> 00:48:32,327
[SPEAKER_11]: It's still a really popular Wii game.

626
00:48:32,807 --> 00:48:34,348
[SPEAKER_11]: Where the hell did that come from?

627
00:48:34,708 --> 00:48:41,472
[SPEAKER_11]: So if that has that kind of popularity and we get the kind of support from Harmonix with this,

628
00:48:41,932 --> 00:48:42,653
[SPEAKER_11]: It'll be awesome.

629
00:48:45,116 --> 00:48:47,018
[SPEAKER_03]: Which, if they're given money, you know they will.

630
00:48:47,479 --> 00:48:49,121
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I'm hoping the support's awesome.

631
00:48:50,082 --> 00:48:59,933
[SPEAKER_11]: On the other hand, Dance Masters, Konami promises download content, but I have yet to see them actually come through with the download content.

632
00:48:59,953 --> 00:49:00,494
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see, we'll see.

633
00:49:00,514 --> 00:49:00,955
[SPEAKER_11]: You never know.

634
00:49:02,396 --> 00:49:03,698
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

635
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:25,883
[SPEAKER_03]: It does have a pretty extensive song library, I gotta say.

636
00:49:25,983 --> 00:49:34,292
[SPEAKER_03]: I was surprised, because I was expecting the library to be nothing but the same old damn songs from 4th Mix, 5th Mix, Max, Max 2, Extreme.

637
00:49:34,472 --> 00:49:36,034
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, all the same old songs, but it wasn't.

638
00:49:36,054 --> 00:49:37,255
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a lot of different stuff in there.

639
00:49:39,493 --> 00:49:50,137
[SPEAKER_11]: I know You Can't Touch Us is actually in DDRX, and I think Just Dance might be in one of the newer They probably are from other DDR games, but I was just surprised that they were licenses.

640
00:49:50,857 --> 00:49:52,798
[SPEAKER_03]: No matter what it is, they are commercial songs.

641
00:49:52,818 --> 00:49:55,339
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, they are still coming out with Dance Dance Revolution.

642
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:58,540
[SPEAKER_11]: Remember how they were going back to Dance Dance Revolution to make it really confusing?

643
00:49:59,420 --> 00:50:00,881
[SPEAKER_11]: For the PS3 and the Wii.

644
00:50:01,061 --> 00:50:01,761
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the Move one.

645
00:50:02,341 --> 00:50:03,402
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, they're different games.

646
00:50:03,482 --> 00:50:05,983
[SPEAKER_03]: Dance Dance Revolution on the Wii is just an extension of Hottest Party.

647
00:50:07,003 --> 00:50:10,204
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not saying it, but it's the same old balance board mode and all that stuff.

648
00:50:10,224 --> 00:50:11,584
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the one on the PS3 is the move.

649
00:50:12,025 --> 00:50:14,745
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the 360 is not getting DDR, it's getting Dance Masters.

650
00:50:14,785 --> 00:50:15,426
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how it's working.

651
00:50:15,566 --> 00:50:15,706
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

652
00:50:16,046 --> 00:50:16,386
[SPEAKER_03]: There it is.

653
00:50:17,326 --> 00:50:17,606
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

654
00:50:18,386 --> 00:50:20,707
[SPEAKER_03]: Hope you wrote down what I said really fast if you need an explanation.

655
00:50:20,927 --> 00:50:26,249
[SPEAKER_03]: And something you could use to write down real fast is a peripheral we talked about last week on the show, the U-Draw.

656
00:50:26,309 --> 00:50:26,769
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember this?

657
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:27,809
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice segue.

658
00:50:28,249 --> 00:50:29,249
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's awesome, huh?

659
00:50:29,510 --> 00:50:36,572
[SPEAKER_03]: The U-Draw was the third-party tablet that they were, I believe THQ was making it to do like a Pictionary game, and there was another game that they were making with this.

660
00:50:36,652 --> 00:50:40,754
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, there's Adventure, and there's also some actual drawing game that comes with the tablet.

661
00:50:40,874 --> 00:50:42,594
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad someone was paying attention last week.

662
00:50:42,634 --> 00:50:49,157
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well, there's a rumor out this week, and it's being run on GoNintendo.com, which, you know, they love their Nintendo over there.

663
00:50:49,817 --> 00:50:53,220
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess they have a tipster who says they have inside info on the U-Draw.

664
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:58,564
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm thinking if I'm GoNintendo, I don't run with this unless I know that there is some clout to this.

665
00:50:58,805 --> 00:50:59,925
[SPEAKER_03]: They've been around a little while.

666
00:51:00,506 --> 00:51:01,707
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's the quote.

667
00:51:03,028 --> 00:51:13,716
[SPEAKER_03]: Both games, talking about Nintendo themselves getting into making games for the U-Draw, are designed with the mass market gamer in mind, yet honor the passion of traditional gamers.

668
00:51:14,277 --> 00:51:18,060
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, one of the huge speculations right off the bat, Mario Paint.

669
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:19,981
[SPEAKER_03]: Finally, a new Mario Paint on the Wii.

670
00:51:20,021 --> 00:51:21,001
[SPEAKER_03]: Could it really be happening?

671
00:51:21,041 --> 00:51:22,982
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be awesome.

672
00:51:23,122 --> 00:51:26,164
[SPEAKER_03]: GoNintendo also speculates Kirby Canvas Curse, perhaps.

673
00:51:26,604 --> 00:51:29,045
[SPEAKER_03]: Although, honestly, insert any DS game here.

674
00:51:29,405 --> 00:51:30,746
[SPEAKER_03]: They can make an adaptation for it on the Wii.

675
00:51:30,766 --> 00:51:33,907
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if they would do another Kirby game that soon after Kirby's Epic Yarn, but...

676
00:51:34,187 --> 00:51:37,228
[SPEAKER_03]: But if they're making it now, it probably wouldn't be out until next Christmas, right?

677
00:51:37,248 --> 00:51:39,228
[SPEAKER_09]: I want a Mario Paint, and I want the music mode.

678
00:51:39,368 --> 00:51:50,210
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a Mario Paint would be great, although I believe it's one of those games you sort of see through retro-colored glasses where it was awesome when you were 12, but now it's... But the music mode was pretty rad.

679
00:51:51,290 --> 00:51:53,651
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's still like a cultish community for that.

680
00:51:54,511 --> 00:51:56,451
[SPEAKER_03]: There's an emulator for just the music mode.

681
00:51:56,571 --> 00:51:59,632
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, imagine if they brought back Mario Paint.

682
00:51:59,892 --> 00:52:00,032
[SPEAKER_03]: Just...

683
00:52:00,652 --> 00:52:01,233
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

684
00:52:17,271 --> 00:52:18,472
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

685
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:35,301
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

686
00:53:03,234 --> 00:53:03,815
[SPEAKER_03]: What a concept!

687
00:53:21,024 --> 00:53:44,414
[SPEAKER_03]: you have those SD cards that you can put in the slot on the Wii, imagine if the chiptune music making mode in this hypothetical Mario Paint game that I've completely made up, you could export MP3s to the SD card, oh my god it wouldn't be MP3s, oh my god it would be AAC files because remember they don't support MP3s anymore, okay fine, AACs then still, still it'd be amazing

688
00:53:46,214 --> 00:54:10,653
[SPEAKER_11]: and while you're at it you release a DS version or a DSi version that comes out as well where not only can you draw stuff but you can take pictures of things and then you know edit them and do all that fun stuff alright well what do you guys think the other game could possibly be Mario Paint I think is the number one fanboy request what would be the other one if you were making a game for Udraw in a Nintendo franchise what do you think it could be

689
00:54:14,607 --> 00:54:31,510
[SPEAKER_11]: Magic Pen Gel It's on Nintendo franchise That would be awesome Maybe if Nintendo made an RPG or something like that I don't think I played That game was so sweet Graffiti Kingdom, I remember that came out That was pretty awesome too, but I didn't play that very much

690
00:54:31,812 --> 00:54:37,496
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna say the other drawing game is a generic Wii blank game.

691
00:54:37,857 --> 00:54:45,483
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, Wii Party, Wii Sports, Wii... One of those, what's the island called now that they have all these games on, and the Wii Fit?

692
00:54:46,023 --> 00:54:47,324
[SPEAKER_03]: There's gonna be a Wii Draw.

693
00:54:47,464 --> 00:54:49,265
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the other Nintendo, it's just Wii Draw.

694
00:54:50,106 --> 00:54:52,028
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, then again, that would just be Mario Paint, wouldn't it?

695
00:54:52,288 --> 00:54:53,910
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe that's what you're getting instead of Mario Paint.

696
00:54:53,930 --> 00:54:57,573
[SPEAKER_11]: What if they had it where you can play Pikmin on it or something like that?

697
00:54:57,854 --> 00:54:58,694
[SPEAKER_11]: Ah, now you're talking.

698
00:54:58,815 --> 00:55:00,156
[SPEAKER_11]: Or like an RTS of some sort.

699
00:55:00,176 --> 00:55:01,537
[SPEAKER_09]: A recreation of the stylus.

700
00:55:03,759 --> 00:55:04,600
[SPEAKER_09]: Like with DS games.

701
00:55:05,021 --> 00:55:09,205
[SPEAKER_09]: Imagine how much easier, by the way, playing Cooking Mama on the Wii would be.

702
00:55:10,946 --> 00:55:11,507
[SPEAKER_03]: With a U-Draw.

703
00:55:11,809 --> 00:55:12,810
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, perhaps.

704
00:55:13,330 --> 00:55:15,391
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you know, it's not Cooking Mama anymore.

705
00:55:15,431 --> 00:55:16,471
[SPEAKER_11]: It's Crafting Mama.

706
00:55:17,072 --> 00:55:17,952
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the next one.

707
00:55:18,372 --> 00:55:20,233
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing I wanted to say about this real quick.

708
00:55:20,494 --> 00:55:24,796
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't it weird, though, that you have a first-party person supporting a third-party device?

709
00:55:25,436 --> 00:55:30,759
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, if Nintendo was planning on making games for this, wouldn't they just suddenly say, me?

710
00:55:30,959 --> 00:55:34,320
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe we want to buy this and make it a first-party peripheral.

711
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:37,700
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems weird to me that THQ is putting this out, but Nintendo is supporting it.

712
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:39,461
[SPEAKER_03]: These things are supposed to work in reverse.

713
00:55:39,681 --> 00:55:44,982
[SPEAKER_11]: Not necessarily, because they could just team up with them and have it actually where they release the peripheral.

714
00:55:45,042 --> 00:55:47,162
[SPEAKER_11]: It'll probably be bundled with one of their games.

715
00:55:47,242 --> 00:55:51,963
[SPEAKER_11]: If they came out with a MarioPay, for example, it would be bundled with the UDraw tablet.

716
00:55:52,103 --> 00:55:54,843
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just made by third parties.

717
00:55:54,883 --> 00:55:55,844
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of like... Well...

718
00:56:00,376 --> 00:56:03,320
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, speaking of firsts, she hasn't gotten to give us a news story tonight yet.

719
00:56:21,252 --> 00:56:23,415
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, how about some stuff for Red Dead Redemption?

720
00:56:24,136 --> 00:56:24,717
[SPEAKER_09]: A.K.A.

721
00:56:24,817 --> 00:56:26,119
[SPEAKER_09]: Grand Theft Horse.

722
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:34,872
[SPEAKER_09]: And I hate that these stupid ads on the side that they want to completely cover the entire page and not give me the little button to close the damn thing.

723
00:56:35,533 --> 00:56:35,693
[SPEAKER_09]: There.

724
00:56:36,613 --> 00:56:40,275
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, this is for Red Dead Redemption.

725
00:56:40,295 --> 00:56:42,936
[SPEAKER_09]: The Liars and Cheats Pack has a date in the UK.

726
00:56:43,636 --> 00:56:47,578
[SPEAKER_09]: And for the PS3 and 360, it will be released on the 21st of September.

727
00:56:48,178 --> 00:56:53,300
[SPEAKER_09]: It will be £7.99 on PlayStation Network and 800 Microsoft Points.

728
00:56:55,021 --> 00:56:57,102
[SPEAKER_09]: That's roughly €9.60 in Euros.

729
00:56:57,162 --> 00:56:57,202
[SPEAKER_09]: So...

730
00:56:59,543 --> 00:57:06,747
[SPEAKER_09]: It was going to be free, but they've decided to make it super nice, and then they can give away free packs.

731
00:57:07,547 --> 00:57:09,769
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, it's going to have different multiplayer modes.

732
00:57:09,869 --> 00:57:13,511
[SPEAKER_09]: One called Stronghold, where you take turns as attack and defense.

733
00:57:14,131 --> 00:57:22,476
[SPEAKER_09]: Multiplayer horse races, poker, liar's dice, an explosive rifle, gang hideouts, hunting grounds.

734
00:57:24,857 --> 00:57:30,002
[SPEAKER_09]: and 15 of the characters in story mode will be playable character skins.

735
00:57:30,583 --> 00:57:31,283
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's cool.

736
00:57:34,046 --> 00:57:40,752
[SPEAKER_03]: So Loki, you play a lot of Grand Theft Auto at work and DarkSakura made a joke calling it Grand Theft Horse.

737
00:57:40,792 --> 00:57:43,375
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do you think Red Dead Redemption hasn't caught on with your little crowd?

738
00:57:44,306 --> 00:57:45,267
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

739
00:58:03,269 --> 00:58:08,071
[SPEAKER_11]: to a deathmatch location on the map, and then you have to trigger it and invite your other people in there.

740
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:14,573
[SPEAKER_11]: And if it's anything like the times we've tried to set up before, the game's really dumb as far as setting up games.

741
00:58:15,613 --> 00:58:25,536
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, for example, we set up a deathmatch one time, and I invited everybody, they accepted, and it started loading the game, and then we ended up in the three separate deathmatches where we were the only player there.

742
00:58:26,357 --> 00:58:27,157
[SPEAKER_11]: I was like, what the hell?

743
00:58:27,837 --> 00:58:32,762
[SPEAKER_11]: So, that's why we don't play Red Dead Redemption right now.

744
00:58:33,083 --> 00:58:35,445
[SPEAKER_11]: We've been just playing Grand Theft Auto.

745
00:58:36,126 --> 00:58:37,787
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, it's fun to stick with.

746
00:58:38,288 --> 00:58:43,173
[SPEAKER_11]: Plus, they're really itching for me to get the mod game back up again so we can play that again.

747
00:58:43,473 --> 00:58:46,096
[SPEAKER_11]: Because that was some of the best games we've ever played.

748
00:58:47,457 --> 00:59:00,244
[SPEAKER_11]: and the best part about it is the guy that made one of the mod tools open for they have a beta version that's out there now that I signed up for the beta for that and the new version allows us to edit the files for Red Dead Redemption.

749
00:59:01,685 --> 00:59:02,906
[SPEAKER_03]: Make your own expansion pack.

750
00:59:02,966 --> 00:59:06,988
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's a very different format so that's something I need to explore.

751
00:59:07,368 --> 00:59:13,592
[SPEAKER_11]: I have to dump it to my hard drive first but it'll be interesting to check that out.

752
00:59:15,060 --> 00:59:17,545
[SPEAKER_09]: I also had another bit for this story as well.

753
00:59:19,369 --> 00:59:24,641
[SPEAKER_09]: For Red Dead Redemption there's a rumor going around that they're casting for the movie and asked Brad Pitt.

754
00:59:25,851 --> 00:59:28,273
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, I just saw that comment from TigerClaw in our chatroom too.

755
00:59:28,313 --> 00:59:30,215
[SPEAKER_03]: It was saying that at chat.orangecountry.com.

756
00:59:30,235 --> 00:59:33,458
[SPEAKER_03]: He said, oh yeah, you heard that Brad Pitt might star in a Red Dead Redemption movie.

757
00:59:33,839 --> 00:59:35,440
[SPEAKER_03]: Why does that sound like fanboy wank to me?

758
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:36,861
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds like fanboy wank to me.

759
00:59:36,982 --> 00:59:43,428
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, according to this, they've given him first refusal on it.

760
00:59:43,548 --> 00:59:44,569
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I don't know.

761
00:59:45,598 --> 00:59:57,427
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I also heard, I saw on LiveJournal or somewhere that apparently they cast, what's his name from Lost, Matthew Fox as the main guy in Mass Effect, which I guess they're making an actual movie out of.

762
00:59:57,507 --> 00:59:59,929
[SPEAKER_03]: And I looked at that and I said, boy, that sounds like Fanboy Wank.

763
01:00:01,490 --> 01:00:03,532
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't even know they were going to make a legitimate Mass Effect movie.

764
01:00:03,552 --> 01:00:05,093
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought they would wait until the trilogy is done.

765
01:00:06,014 --> 01:00:06,154
[SPEAKER_07]: But...

766
01:00:06,747 --> 01:00:08,729
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they're going to try to release it at the same time?

767
01:00:08,809 --> 01:00:09,150
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

768
01:00:10,151 --> 01:00:12,854
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I have to check and see.

769
01:00:12,914 --> 01:00:20,762
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't read the show roll all the way yet, but there was another movie thing that I don't remember if we're talking about it or not.

770
01:00:23,665 --> 01:00:23,786
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh...

771
01:00:24,366 --> 01:00:25,106
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think so.

772
01:00:25,126 --> 01:00:25,667
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think so.

773
01:00:25,707 --> 01:00:26,707
[SPEAKER_03]: If we spoil it, we spoil it.

774
01:00:26,727 --> 01:00:27,067
[SPEAKER_03]: Oops.

775
01:00:27,107 --> 01:00:28,868
[SPEAKER_11]: Whatever, okay.

776
01:00:30,469 --> 01:00:39,093
[SPEAKER_11]: Honestly, I am not familiar with this series because I don't own an iPhone or something like that, but was it Big Angry Bird or something like that?

777
01:00:39,333 --> 01:00:39,733
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yeah.

778
01:00:39,813 --> 01:00:41,454
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard of Angry Birds.

779
01:00:41,514 --> 01:00:42,074
[SPEAKER_11]: Angry Birds.

780
01:00:42,534 --> 01:00:44,275
[SPEAKER_11]: So they're supposed to be making a movie out of that.

781
01:00:44,455 --> 01:00:48,097
[SPEAKER_11]: That sounds dumb, but I don't know.

782
01:00:50,365 --> 01:00:50,785
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

783
01:00:50,805 --> 01:00:53,468
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know what kind of game you'd make out of that, but whatever.

784
01:00:53,828 --> 01:01:02,815
[SPEAKER_11]: I think what it's come down to is the movie industry is really hurting for original ideas, so now they're trying to just develop everything into a movie.

785
01:01:03,396 --> 01:01:14,725
[SPEAKER_11]: A perfect example of that is the whole Hasbro licensing with the Ouija game, the movie, or Battleship the movie, or Monopoly the movie.

786
01:01:14,825 --> 01:01:16,106
[SPEAKER_09]: They did Ouija the movie.

787
01:01:16,126 --> 01:01:17,087
[SPEAKER_09]: It was called The Exorcist.

788
01:01:18,217 --> 01:01:20,739
[SPEAKER_03]: or this nonsense that they're remaking Clue the movie.

789
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:25,363
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not remaking the 80s version of Clue which will always be a timeless classic.

790
01:01:26,184 --> 01:01:37,673
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just going to make a new movie based off a Clue that'll be I'm sure it's wonderful of a piece of cinema as the Clue 2 Murder in Disguise VCR game where you get to see Mr. Green dressed up as Madam Rose.

791
01:01:37,733 --> 01:01:38,694
[SPEAKER_03]: It was quality cinema.

792
01:01:40,962 --> 01:01:42,284
[SPEAKER_11]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

793
01:01:56,660 --> 01:02:02,228
[SPEAKER_11]: and it is being dealt with swiftly by Sony as well.

794
01:02:04,170 --> 01:02:14,304
[SPEAKER_11]: It was confirmed, I guess, by a bunch of different sources that despite the fact that one video showed it running on a dev console, it is actually the real deal.

795
01:02:15,444 --> 01:02:17,205
[SPEAKER_11]: It's actually sold out as well.

796
01:02:17,945 --> 01:02:25,929
[SPEAKER_11]: And, of course, it goes without saying that Sony, they say they have a way to detect whether you're running it or not, and they will ban you.

797
01:02:26,009 --> 01:02:29,730
[SPEAKER_11]: So, buyer beware, I suppose.

798
01:02:30,931 --> 01:02:35,993
[SPEAKER_11]: And apparently, I guess the device is kind of similar to the Pandora battery that was on the PSP.

799
01:02:37,034 --> 01:02:37,794
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

800
01:02:53,150 --> 01:03:05,474
[SPEAKER_11]: and Sony Australia has granted a temporary injunction by the federal court to block the importation and sale of the new mod chips as well.

801
01:03:05,894 --> 01:03:08,775
[SPEAKER_11]: It is a temporary injunction, means until August 31st.

802
01:03:09,335 --> 01:03:13,736
[SPEAKER_11]: So during that time, actually Sony will have, I guess...

803
01:03:15,077 --> 01:03:20,822
[SPEAKER_11]: They're the only ones that they can be sold to, and I'm not sure if they actually get to seize the hardware or whatever.

804
01:03:21,363 --> 01:03:24,626
[SPEAKER_11]: But this device wasn't made in Australia, right?

805
01:03:25,547 --> 01:03:35,616
[SPEAKER_11]: This isn't made in Australia, but Oz Modchips was one of the first modchip resellers that had these chips.

806
01:03:35,717 --> 01:03:35,917
[SPEAKER_11]: So...

807
01:03:37,458 --> 01:03:37,798
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

808
01:03:37,818 --> 01:03:40,419
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess it blocks something.

809
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:42,280
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see.

810
01:03:42,420 --> 01:03:44,421
[SPEAKER_11]: August 31st is a couple days away.

811
01:03:45,801 --> 01:03:51,403
[SPEAKER_11]: Especially if they aren't granted an extension on that, you better believe it.

812
01:03:51,423 --> 01:03:54,364
[SPEAKER_11]: They're going to kick that shit out of the door immediately.

813
01:03:55,925 --> 01:04:00,089
[SPEAKER_11]: Or you could just import one from the US, Canada, Switzerland, right?

814
01:04:00,189 --> 01:04:00,609
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly.

815
01:04:00,850 --> 01:04:08,657
[SPEAKER_11]: So, unless, unless, and I don't know, unless maybe they were the first ones to get it, and then those companies are buying it from Osmodchips, who knows.

816
01:04:10,538 --> 01:04:17,124
[SPEAKER_11]: And so, of course, you have the, basically, the temporary injunction does halt the sale to anyone but Sony.

817
01:04:17,825 --> 01:04:18,305
[SPEAKER_11]: Apparently...

818
01:04:20,366 --> 01:04:24,048
[SPEAKER_11]: They are legally forced to sell the PS jailbreaks to Sony.

819
01:04:26,228 --> 01:04:30,810
[SPEAKER_11]: And in any case, I guess they have a chance to figure out how the thing works.

820
01:04:31,790 --> 01:04:34,311
[SPEAKER_11]: In the meantime, I'm sure that they could buy one anyways.

821
01:04:35,431 --> 01:04:37,292
[SPEAKER_11]: They probably will try to figure out how it works.

822
01:04:37,672 --> 01:04:42,734
[SPEAKER_11]: And if anything, it probably works very similar to the way their dev kit stuff works.

823
01:04:43,915 --> 01:05:10,238
[SPEAKER_11]: and then of course the reason why they're trying to or they got the temporary injunction anyways is saying that apparently the device uses some sort of code that's from the dev kit or something like that that is proprietary and that it's violating whatever of course whoever is making these chips actually are saying that they don't use any of that stuff

824
01:05:11,278 --> 01:05:13,719
[SPEAKER_11]: and they aren't too worried by what's going on.

825
01:05:14,059 --> 01:05:18,441
[SPEAKER_11]: They're saying there was kind of a short back and forth Q&A with them.

826
01:05:20,462 --> 01:05:24,683
[SPEAKER_11]: It says companies in Australia get a lot of problems.

827
01:05:25,063 --> 01:05:27,524
[SPEAKER_11]: Sony halts Australian resellers.

828
01:05:28,665 --> 01:05:29,685
[SPEAKER_11]: Is this a big problem?

829
01:05:29,965 --> 01:05:32,546
[SPEAKER_11]: And it says it's a temporary injunction until August 31st.

830
01:05:33,386 --> 01:05:34,427
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll be reached then.

831
01:05:34,527 --> 01:05:36,007
[SPEAKER_11]: Nothing illegal has been done.

832
01:05:36,327 --> 01:05:37,628
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just a scare tactic.

833
01:05:38,548 --> 01:05:44,395
[SPEAKER_11]: and it says there's no copyright code and we have not interfered with any intellectual property laws.

834
01:05:45,056 --> 01:05:47,579
[SPEAKER_11]: The device is designed for homebrew, nothing illegal.

835
01:05:49,727 --> 01:05:54,210
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess you can say nothing illegal, but obviously it can be used both ways.

836
01:05:55,771 --> 01:05:59,294
[SPEAKER_11]: The product is very different from every other mod.

837
01:05:59,394 --> 01:06:00,054
[SPEAKER_11]: Nothing illegal.

838
01:06:00,274 --> 01:06:02,956
[SPEAKER_11]: Once again, reinforcing that.

839
01:06:04,057 --> 01:06:07,600
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, but all these shops returning customers' money back.

840
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,201
[SPEAKER_11]: People informed saying the order's canceled.

841
01:06:10,341 --> 01:06:11,843
[SPEAKER_11]: It says it's just a scare tactic.

842
01:06:11,923 --> 01:06:12,963
[SPEAKER_11]: It's obviously working.

843
01:06:13,564 --> 01:06:14,985
[SPEAKER_11]: It will work in Europe also.

844
01:06:15,005 --> 01:06:16,566
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

845
01:06:18,618 --> 01:06:19,179
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

846
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:37,062
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for watching!

847
01:06:54,727 --> 01:06:55,168
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see.

848
01:06:55,869 --> 01:07:03,464
[SPEAKER_11]: Like I said, I have one on order for the hell of it because I like to get everything, especially stuff that people don't want me to have.

849
01:07:04,907 --> 01:07:05,608
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice rationale.

850
01:07:06,519 --> 01:07:07,140
[SPEAKER_11]: Whatever.

851
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:09,201
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't have to justify it.

852
01:07:10,162 --> 01:07:11,383
[SPEAKER_11]: I spend plenty of money on games.

853
01:07:12,964 --> 01:07:16,367
[SPEAKER_11]: I have one on order and I'm not worried about it.

854
01:07:16,827 --> 01:07:25,394
[SPEAKER_11]: Like they said, if for some reason Sony does put some permanent injunction and prevents them from selling it, I get my money back.

855
01:07:26,335 --> 01:07:27,796
[SPEAKER_11]: If they don't, I get a mod chip.

856
01:07:28,116 --> 01:07:31,179
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't see how I lose out in this scenario.

857
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:32,920
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not a big deal.

858
01:07:34,341 --> 01:07:34,621
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

859
01:07:35,002 --> 01:07:41,146
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I don't know if the jailbreak will help out with this situation if it's adopted by Sony, but it's something that's becoming more and more popular.

860
01:07:41,206 --> 01:07:42,927
[SPEAKER_03]: We've talked about it quite at length on this show.

861
01:07:43,447 --> 01:07:44,888
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the online pass.

862
01:07:45,048 --> 01:07:45,889
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you remember that?

863
01:07:46,529 --> 01:07:52,513
[SPEAKER_03]: It's showing up in the EA Sports Games now, and I think THQ, Ubisoft supposedly is putting this on board.

864
01:07:54,074 --> 01:08:05,140
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you don't remember what the online pass is, it's where you pay $10 if you buy the game used for a code so that you can actually play the game online and unlock other features.

865
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:08,341
[SPEAKER_03]: It's locked out if you don't have the code.

866
01:08:08,501 --> 01:08:11,063
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, if you buy the game new, it comes with a code.

867
01:08:11,503 --> 01:08:13,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, guess what company is supposedly getting on board?

868
01:08:14,605 --> 01:08:15,045
[SPEAKER_03]: Sony.

869
01:08:15,545 --> 01:08:18,287
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right, Sony themselves for their first party games.

870
01:08:18,627 --> 01:08:21,988
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a comment from Sony Computer Entertainment Europe, Andrew House.

871
01:08:22,389 --> 01:08:23,449
[SPEAKER_03]: Quote, Because of mod chips like this.

872
01:08:38,210 --> 01:08:38,911
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, think about it.

873
01:08:38,991 --> 01:08:39,691
[SPEAKER_11]: That's one way.

874
01:08:39,791 --> 01:08:44,334
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, we'll prevent people from getting online because they won't have access to a code to get online.

875
01:08:44,394 --> 01:08:49,437
[SPEAKER_11]: Therefore, you know, enticing people to buy games.

876
01:08:50,118 --> 01:08:56,982
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, of course, this story made rounds all over the Internet because, you know, hearing Sony's going to jump on board gets, you know, people's ears perked.

877
01:08:57,022 --> 01:09:00,684
[SPEAKER_03]: But I like this particular perspective on it that was on Destructoid.

878
01:09:01,304 --> 01:09:03,846
[SPEAKER_03]: One of their authors over there when they ran the story said this.

879
01:09:03,986 --> 01:09:05,147
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought this was very good.

880
01:09:05,367 --> 01:09:06,588
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, this is from Destructoid.com.

881
01:09:07,948 --> 01:09:11,410
[SPEAKER_03]: quote, it seems that this is most certainly the future of online play.

882
01:09:11,550 --> 01:09:12,851
[SPEAKER_03]: Buy new or pay for it.

883
01:09:13,191 --> 01:09:14,231
[SPEAKER_03]: I still think it's ludicrous.

884
01:09:14,272 --> 01:09:18,313
[SPEAKER_03]: The industry relies more on trading credit than I think any publisher will want to admit.

885
01:09:18,674 --> 01:09:27,718
[SPEAKER_03]: And if trade-in values are diminished because of this, well, good luck trying to compete in an already competitive market when gamers find themselves even less able to afford your $60 luxuries.

886
01:09:28,238 --> 01:09:34,141
[SPEAKER_03]: And sums it up with this, the author does, if used games disappeared tomorrow, the market would crash.

887
01:09:34,661 --> 01:09:35,682
[SPEAKER_03]: I guarantee it.

888
01:09:37,176 --> 01:09:37,796
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's true.

889
01:09:37,816 --> 01:09:41,098
[SPEAKER_03]: He makes an interesting point.

890
01:09:41,578 --> 01:09:43,999
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a really interesting point.

891
01:09:44,060 --> 01:09:47,241
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it is an interesting point and here's my point to it right now.

892
01:09:47,741 --> 01:09:52,064
[SPEAKER_11]: As of right now, the stuff that they seem to be targeting is sports games.

893
01:09:53,264 --> 01:10:12,697
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if you're a sports gamer or if you should take offense to that because really they're the ones that they seem to be targeting because right now it's just UFC 2010, Tiger Woods 2011, NCAA 11, Madden 11, and then of course SmackDown vs. Raw 11.

894
01:10:13,357 --> 01:10:20,122
[SPEAKER_11]: Those are all if you would consider sports titles right now and they're also talking that this is going to be done in I guess MLB The Show 11.

895
01:10:20,162 --> 01:10:20,262
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

896
01:10:20,882 --> 01:10:28,387
[SPEAKER_03]: It's interesting that you say that because Ranma in our chatroom at chat.orange.online.com says, I have no problem with the online pass since they're just for sports games.

897
01:10:28,887 --> 01:10:32,209
[SPEAKER_03]: Once it passes to non-sports games, then I'll have a problem with it.

898
01:10:33,445 --> 01:10:36,447
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems to me there's different types of gamers too.

899
01:10:36,527 --> 01:10:54,142
[SPEAKER_03]: You have people that buy their systems, their consoles, and this is a significant amount of people for nothing but Madden, NBA, and a lot of those games that Loki named save for the occasional Halo, Call of Duty, and those types of mega games.

900
01:10:54,623 --> 01:11:00,468
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you have kind of the gamers like I think the majority of the people that listen to our show that like to play some of the more

901
01:11:01,168 --> 01:11:06,550
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, there's some crossovers.

902
01:11:06,590 --> 01:11:08,831
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not saying none of you like to play sports games.

903
01:11:08,891 --> 01:11:12,312
[SPEAKER_03]: Even I like Double Dribble and Blades of Steel and some of those old school sports games.

904
01:11:12,592 --> 01:11:13,292
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know what I mean.

905
01:11:13,653 --> 01:11:19,055
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, there definitely is kind of two factions of gaming, if you will.

906
01:11:19,435 --> 01:11:22,856
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is interesting that only this one seems to be impacted so far by this.

907
01:11:23,416 --> 01:11:28,538
[SPEAKER_11]: And something I would like to add is a story that didn't make our show roll, but I thought it was very interesting.

908
01:11:29,966 --> 01:11:38,733
[SPEAKER_11]: Ballsy of them to be making this sort of argument, but THQ basically called people that buy used games cheaters.

909
01:11:39,133 --> 01:11:44,037
[SPEAKER_11]: Like they're cheating the devs out of their hard-earned money or something.

910
01:11:44,737 --> 01:11:45,058
[SPEAKER_09]: That's...

911
01:11:45,666 --> 01:11:46,507
[SPEAKER_09]: That's ridiculous.

912
01:11:46,547 --> 01:11:48,829
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just kind of an ignorant argument.

913
01:11:48,949 --> 01:12:02,279
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to see where they're coming from, but that's very ignorant to the world we live in because does Paramount Pictures and 20th Century Fox say that about used DVD sales and used Blu-ray sales?

914
01:12:04,241 --> 01:12:05,542
[SPEAKER_03]: What is a garage sale?

915
01:12:05,722 --> 01:12:07,203
[SPEAKER_03]: Is a garage sale a cheating...

916
01:12:08,364 --> 01:12:09,525
[SPEAKER_03]: Party.

917
01:12:10,345 --> 01:12:13,447
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, selling your old shit is a part of American culture.

918
01:12:13,467 --> 01:12:17,649
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's what I don't understand that they're complaining anyways because here's the thing.

919
01:12:18,350 --> 01:12:23,913
[SPEAKER_11]: When they've sold it to their retailer, they've already sold their copies to the retailer.

920
01:12:23,953 --> 01:12:24,753
[SPEAKER_11]: They have their money.

921
01:12:25,173 --> 01:12:33,598
[SPEAKER_11]: It's up to the retailer to decide, hey, if people are buying used copies, then that sucks for me because I still have this new copy on the shelf or something like that.

922
01:12:34,058 --> 01:12:34,479
[SPEAKER_11]: But I don't...

923
01:12:35,655 --> 01:12:46,788
[SPEAKER_11]: THQ's Corey Ledesma said, I don't think we really care whether used game buyers are upset because new game buyers get everything.

924
01:12:49,171 --> 01:12:55,017
[SPEAKER_11]: So if used game buyers are upset that they don't get online features set, I don't really have much sympathy for them.

925
01:12:56,478 --> 01:12:59,540
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a little blunt, but we hope it doesn't disappoint people.

926
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:05,563
[SPEAKER_11]: We hope that people understand that when the game is used, we get cheated.

927
01:13:07,343 --> 01:13:12,946
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't see how you get cheated because there's still the same amount of people playing your damn game that there were before.

928
01:13:15,158 --> 01:13:17,339
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't understand how that you're cheated.

929
01:13:17,419 --> 01:13:22,541
[SPEAKER_11]: And if anything, say someone buys it used and they like it, then they go out and buy the next version.

930
01:13:22,581 --> 01:13:27,242
[SPEAKER_11]: Say, you know, I bought Saints Row 1 used or something like that, and I'm like, whoa, this is an awesome game.

931
01:13:27,302 --> 01:13:29,723
[SPEAKER_11]: And then Saints Row 2 comes out, I buy it new day one.

932
01:13:30,263 --> 01:13:35,345
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't understand how they lose out on this, but I'll tell you something, I'm not fucking buying your sports games, so...

933
01:13:37,226 --> 01:13:51,103
[SPEAKER_11]: whatever and I'll tell you what man I'll think twice about buying your other games if you have this kind of crap or the U-Draw which we talked about earlier in the show well the U-Draw is not going to have that because Wii doesn't really do online stuff too much and that's not really what they're going after but

934
01:13:51,844 --> 01:13:56,226
[SPEAKER_11]: It's still retarded to think that... It's still the same company.

935
01:13:56,246 --> 01:13:59,147
[SPEAKER_11]: And they've made excuses left and right.

936
01:13:59,327 --> 01:14:01,088
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, we get cheated out of stuff.

937
01:14:01,468 --> 01:14:02,248
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, wait a second.

938
01:14:02,268 --> 01:14:06,690
[SPEAKER_11]: You get cheated because you're not selling a new copy and so you're trying to entice people to buy new copies?

939
01:14:06,990 --> 01:14:13,532
[SPEAKER_11]: But I thought before you were saying that you needed this extra money to support your online services that you're now providing extra options for.

940
01:14:13,952 --> 01:14:20,195
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, wait, but now you're just saying that it's because all these used sales are really cutting into your profits.

941
01:14:21,977 --> 01:14:27,520
[SPEAKER_11]: Be glad you're selling copies at all because if you keep this kind of attitude up, you know, hey, let me tell you this much.

942
01:14:27,560 --> 01:14:29,541
[SPEAKER_11]: It hasn't helped Activision too much.

943
01:14:31,343 --> 01:14:33,664
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to go to our chat room, chat.orange.com.

944
01:14:33,724 --> 01:14:40,828
[SPEAKER_03]: Ranma just kind of takes one glove off and slaps THQ across the face saying, no, the companies that market the games at $59.99 are cheaters.

945
01:14:43,124 --> 01:15:11,517
[SPEAKER_11]: and the other thing too is on top of all that stuff calling these people cheaters and stuff you're putting out these sports games and I don't want to make generic you know I don't want to put out generic opinions of these sports games but a lot of people kind of agree that a lot of times these are just kind of roster updates that they put out each year and well to be fair it's the way that that faction looks at music games exactly and don't get me wrong I mean a lot of music games out there especially the Guitar Freak series

946
01:15:12,077 --> 01:15:15,980
[SPEAKER_11]: is just a different song list each year, and that's it.

947
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:21,443
[SPEAKER_11]: But, I mean, it's not like vast improvements between each game.

948
01:15:23,405 --> 01:15:27,107
[SPEAKER_11]: And the fact that they're saying, oh, well, we want you to pay extra money for this.

949
01:15:27,487 --> 01:15:31,830
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, and then we have this download content that could have been added in there for free, but we want a little bit more money.

950
01:15:32,591 --> 01:15:35,753
[SPEAKER_11]: And, oh, now you bought a used, so now you have to pay for online access.

951
01:15:35,813 --> 01:15:36,433
[SPEAKER_11]: But guess what?

952
01:15:37,354 --> 01:15:41,757
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe the used players will learn not to really give a shit about the online access.

953
01:15:42,117 --> 01:15:43,157
[SPEAKER_11]: Then what are you gonna do?

954
01:15:43,618 --> 01:15:49,220
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, look, they bought all your used games, you're still getting cheated, and they're not buying your stupid, you know, internet access.

955
01:15:49,300 --> 01:15:50,660
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me get to other chatroom comments.

956
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:55,242
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft in our chatroom says, Don't know, the used DVDs and Blu-ray market ain't that big.

957
01:15:55,842 --> 01:15:58,583
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep in mind, he's in another country, so I don't know if...

958
01:15:59,163 --> 01:16:06,129
[SPEAKER_03]: If that changes the perspective, I mean, I think if there's a store here that does nothing but sell used DVDs and that sort of thing.

959
01:16:06,169 --> 01:16:20,200
[SPEAKER_11]: I can tell you right now that the studios don't like used sales because at one time we were buying, because, you know, Redbox and stuff, they turn over their DVDs quite quick and they have to offload all that used product.

960
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:22,461
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, we used to buy it and then turn around and sell it.

961
01:16:23,322 --> 01:16:23,702
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura.com

962
01:16:49,049 --> 01:17:17,693
[SPEAKER_03]: um Actdeft goes on to say they're cheated out of the money they should have supposed to get with the sale of the new game uh let's see Ranma says I'm sorry THQ wrestling games are not sports games since WWE and so on is sports entertainment Satellite Minded says people are already paying to play games online why do they have to pay more for content that's on the disc and Tiger Claw says it all comes down to one word greed and I agree and you know what um it's kind of funny though like

963
01:17:19,443 --> 01:17:30,068
[SPEAKER_11]: If Microsoft did this, I think there would be a shit storm because people are already paying for online access and they'd be like, why the fuck do I have to pay for more online access?

964
01:17:30,088 --> 01:17:31,188
[SPEAKER_11]: It's probably why they don't.

965
01:17:32,008 --> 01:17:33,389
[SPEAKER_11]: It's probably smart to do this.

966
01:17:34,329 --> 01:17:35,950
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see how it plays out over there.

967
01:17:36,130 --> 01:17:37,451
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not a popular idea.

968
01:17:38,951 --> 01:17:40,272
[SPEAKER_11]: I just don't think it's necessary.

969
01:17:41,873 --> 01:17:42,753
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's what you need to do.

970
01:17:43,033 --> 01:17:46,775
[SPEAKER_11]: It's so simple and a lot of times they're doing it already, but

971
01:17:47,575 --> 01:17:51,896
[SPEAKER_11]: All you gotta do is just sell download content, you know?

972
01:17:52,197 --> 01:18:00,960
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't even necessarily have to, you know, cut stuff out of your game, but just support it with download content and you'll make a lot of money back, whether they bought it new or used.

973
01:18:01,020 --> 01:18:07,982
[SPEAKER_11]: If they bought it new, great, you make that sale and you make additional money, but if they bought it used, they're still buying download content.

974
01:18:09,238 --> 01:18:11,701
[SPEAKER_11]: and I don't see how you lose out of that because that's digital.

975
01:18:11,741 --> 01:18:13,103
[SPEAKER_11]: It's pure profit pretty much.

976
01:18:14,385 --> 01:18:14,705
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

977
01:18:15,006 --> 01:18:15,627
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's move on.

978
01:18:15,907 --> 01:18:17,709
[SPEAKER_03]: We spent a lot of time on this topic.

979
01:18:17,769 --> 01:18:19,251
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got a lot more stories to cover.

980
01:18:19,652 --> 01:18:26,581
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of legal things, I believe DarkSakura's got a more legally oriented story for us that could also be setting a precedent soon for the future of games.

981
01:18:26,895 --> 01:18:27,837
[SPEAKER_09]: That I do.

982
01:18:29,018 --> 01:18:35,587
[SPEAKER_09]: There is a case that was... The U.S.

983
01:18:35,627 --> 01:18:41,755
[SPEAKER_09]: Supreme Court is going to be reviewing Schwarzenegger vs. the Entertainment Merchants Association.

984
01:18:42,516 --> 01:18:53,780
[SPEAKER_09]: about a law that they're trying to get passed here that would put fines on renting or selling violent games to kids.

985
01:18:55,241 --> 01:19:07,866
[SPEAKER_09]: The way they're trying to get around the First Amendment rule is that they're easier to get their hands on and would cause more immediate harm than seeing it through TV movies or the internet.

986
01:19:09,369 --> 01:19:12,950
[SPEAKER_03]: How is buying a video game easier than TV?

987
01:19:13,990 --> 01:19:15,650
[SPEAKER_03]: You turn a box on.

988
01:19:17,051 --> 01:19:18,051
[SPEAKER_03]: That astounds me.

989
01:19:18,131 --> 01:19:19,471
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a bold argument.

990
01:19:19,491 --> 01:19:20,351
[SPEAKER_11]: It's dumb.

991
01:19:20,591 --> 01:19:22,592
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't understand why they're making this argument.

992
01:19:24,232 --> 01:19:27,593
[SPEAKER_11]: Wasting time on issues that really don't need to be even focused on.

993
01:19:28,093 --> 01:19:37,975
[SPEAKER_09]: The rest of the issue, too, is that while there are rules protecting minors from sexual imagery, there's not too many about violence.

994
01:19:39,769 --> 01:19:42,991
[SPEAKER_09]: The way that I see that is, again, it's scapegoatism.

995
01:19:43,372 --> 01:19:47,635
[SPEAKER_09]: Easy target, let's put everything on the video games and absolve the parents of their responsibility.

996
01:19:47,815 --> 01:19:48,895
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly, that's all it is.

997
01:19:48,975 --> 01:19:52,918
[SPEAKER_11]: Because if the parents aren't going to be responsible, then the government's got to be responsible for the kids, right?

998
01:19:54,039 --> 01:19:55,660
[SPEAKER_11]: Because that's the stance that they want to take.

999
01:19:55,860 --> 01:19:59,042
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's absolutely stupid that they're going to have laws.

1000
01:19:59,062 --> 01:19:59,642
[SPEAKER_11]: They're even going to...

1001
01:20:00,883 --> 01:20:09,750
[SPEAKER_11]: Really, I think it might be a way to generate some revenue for the states or whatever, just so they can find these people and make some extra money.

1002
01:20:10,491 --> 01:20:19,298
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe that's why they're driven to do this, but I don't see... I think it's really up to the parent to decide what's appropriate for their children.

1003
01:20:19,318 --> 01:20:19,558
[SPEAKER_11]: Agreed.

1004
01:20:19,578 --> 01:20:22,561
[SPEAKER_11]: If they want to play violent video games, then that's fine.

1005
01:20:23,061 --> 01:20:25,703
[SPEAKER_11]: Halo, an M-rated game, I don't think that's really that bad.

1006
01:20:25,763 --> 01:20:26,044
[SPEAKER_11]: I think a...

1007
01:20:27,965 --> 01:20:33,472
[SPEAKER_11]: Adolescent kid can handle that kind of stuff because it's really sci-fi.

1008
01:20:33,512 --> 01:20:39,719
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, Manhunt or something like that, that's a little different, but it's all what you decide is appropriate for your child.

1009
01:20:40,520 --> 01:20:48,048
[SPEAKER_09]: I know I've brought this up before, but have you seen that episode in Season 7 of Bullshit where they talked about video games and they had you-know-who

1010
01:20:48,889 --> 01:20:49,289
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura,

1011
01:21:07,518 --> 01:21:23,199
[SPEAKER_09]: and they take the kid out to go shoot an actual gun a real gun his mom's there they've got cops there everything's cool kid shot the gun once and didn't want to touch it again and it had him reduced to tears so

1012
01:21:25,154 --> 01:21:28,038
[SPEAKER_09]: Clearly, there is a difference.

1013
01:21:28,198 --> 01:21:37,409
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, if you play a game, you know, a violent game on the TV or even a little gun game on the TV versus shooting an actual firearm.

1014
01:21:38,290 --> 01:21:39,892
[SPEAKER_03]: I've gotten into a similar thing on this show.

1015
01:21:39,932 --> 01:21:44,237
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I enjoy the occasional, you know, Quake, Unreal Tournament and shooting game.

1016
01:21:44,597 --> 01:21:46,779
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't like guns at all.

1017
01:21:46,899 --> 01:21:48,460
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't ever want one in my house.

1018
01:21:48,701 --> 01:21:50,342
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm against them for me.

1019
01:21:51,123 --> 01:21:52,263
[SPEAKER_03]: I realize there's a second amendment.

1020
01:21:52,284 --> 01:21:53,665
[SPEAKER_03]: If other people want to have them, that's their right.

1021
01:21:53,725 --> 01:21:57,007
[SPEAKER_03]: But for me, I hate guns, like real ones.

1022
01:21:57,388 --> 01:21:58,649
[SPEAKER_03]: But I like gun games.

1023
01:21:59,790 --> 01:22:00,931
[SPEAKER_11]: But see, it's totally...

1024
01:22:02,612 --> 01:22:04,694
[SPEAKER_11]: It doesn't teach you how to kill people.

1025
01:22:05,135 --> 01:22:05,615
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it doesn't.

1026
01:22:05,815 --> 01:22:14,524
[SPEAKER_11]: If anything, it teaches you maybe tactics and stuff like that, but in the end, it doesn't teach you how to actually fire the weapon or use the weapon or anything like that.

1027
01:22:14,764 --> 01:22:18,828
[SPEAKER_09]: And the human mind is going to be far more creative than an AI in a game would be.

1028
01:22:19,489 --> 01:22:21,591
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me get to our chatroom, chat.orange.com.

1029
01:22:21,631 --> 01:22:25,194
[SPEAKER_03]: Frisbee wants to know, California residents, when does Arnold leave the governor's seat?

1030
01:22:25,574 --> 01:22:26,395
[SPEAKER_03]: January, I believe.

1031
01:22:26,715 --> 01:22:30,499
[SPEAKER_03]: And ironically enough, just a couple days after this is heard is the election.

1032
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:38,646
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's past the primaries, and it's down to the Meg Whitman's, the former CEO of eBay.

1033
01:22:38,726 --> 01:22:39,546
[SPEAKER_03]: She's the Republican.

1034
01:22:39,887 --> 01:22:43,970
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you have Jerry Brown, who was the governor of California in the late 70s, early 80s.

1035
01:22:45,771 --> 01:22:49,813
[SPEAKER_03]: But because term limits didn't go in until after he was in office, he's able to run again.

1036
01:22:50,173 --> 01:22:51,654
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a very interesting matchup.

1037
01:22:52,094 --> 01:22:52,895
[SPEAKER_03]: Very interesting.

1038
01:22:53,875 --> 01:22:55,056
[SPEAKER_11]: And neither one I like.

1039
01:22:55,676 --> 01:22:57,597
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the way a lot of people in this state feel.

1040
01:22:57,857 --> 01:23:03,199
[SPEAKER_11]: I hate her a lot just because of her campaign right now because it's just smear, smear, smear, smear, smear.

1041
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:06,981
[SPEAKER_03]: For a lot of people I talk to, it's who do you dislike less.

1042
01:23:08,266 --> 01:23:17,676
[SPEAKER_03]: I've made up my mind but I'm also a one issue kind of person and both candidates have made it pretty clear where they stand on the issue so I know where I'm voting.

1043
01:23:19,422 --> 01:23:23,444
[SPEAKER_09]: my absentee ballot should be coming before too long are you voting for Bill the Cat?

1044
01:23:24,925 --> 01:23:38,370
[SPEAKER_09]: no but keep in mind that I vote absentee every time I vote so that I can make a photocopy of my vote and then mail in my original so that it can't be tampered with but that's me

1045
01:23:40,972 --> 01:24:02,689
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, the other thing I was going to say, too, in response to the whole violent video game things, and we've also brought this up, too, is that the rate of violence has gone down in minors since, or at least gun-related violence, I think, or armed violence has gone down since 1991, you know, when the Nintendo popped up.

1046
01:24:04,050 --> 01:24:17,399
[SPEAKER_09]: Another thing too, and this just has to go to guns in general, is I think that a lack of exposure opens up the door, I think, for putting people in danger.

1047
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:28,266
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it's actually a proven statistic that in those gun-free zones, you know what I'm talking about, that the rate of gun-related violence is higher.

1048
01:24:29,186 --> 01:24:32,869
[SPEAKER_09]: Because anyone... People always want what they can't have?

1049
01:24:33,655 --> 01:24:34,196
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

1050
01:24:43,835 --> 01:24:44,675
[SPEAKER_09]: who won't be armed.

1051
01:24:44,876 --> 01:24:45,596
[SPEAKER_09]: They won't be armed.

1052
01:24:46,436 --> 01:24:47,397
[SPEAKER_09]: It makes people a target.

1053
01:24:48,117 --> 01:24:54,780
[SPEAKER_09]: If you know in a place you're going to go somewhere where you've got a likely chance that they're going to be following the rules there, you've got an easy target.

1054
01:24:55,901 --> 01:25:05,345
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the states where people are allowed to carry firearms on them that they have the lowest amount because an armed society is a polite society.

1055
01:25:06,146 --> 01:25:08,367
[SPEAKER_09]: These are related, trust me.

1056
01:25:09,427 --> 01:25:09,627
[SPEAKER_09]: But

1057
01:25:11,608 --> 01:25:19,555
[SPEAKER_09]: If you can establish this difference, make them something that someone's exposed to and say, hey, this is a dangerous object.

1058
01:25:19,675 --> 01:25:20,976
[SPEAKER_09]: You shouldn't be using this.

1059
01:25:21,476 --> 01:25:23,138
[SPEAKER_09]: This is not the same thing as this.

1060
01:25:23,198 --> 01:25:32,486
[SPEAKER_09]: When you give them item A and item B to compare, then I think that that level of exposure is going to put it in pretty early.

1061
01:25:33,046 --> 01:25:34,687
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, well, this is not reality.

1062
01:25:34,948 --> 01:25:36,529
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't have to be afraid of this.

1063
01:25:37,470 --> 01:25:37,950
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?

1064
01:25:39,211 --> 01:25:45,722
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know a lot of people can distinguish between what's real and what's not real, even kids, and I think a lot of times they just...

1065
01:25:47,731 --> 01:25:48,492
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what they blame.

1066
01:25:48,792 --> 01:25:51,935
[SPEAKER_11]: If they're not blaming video games for violence, they're blaming guns for violence.

1067
01:25:52,935 --> 01:26:06,486
[SPEAKER_11]: The problem is, no one's ever calling these people out and saying, especially these court cases, they go, oh, the video game made me do it, and the judge just doesn't go, take some goddamn responsibility for yourself.

1068
01:26:06,527 --> 01:26:11,811
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a few that have been thrown out, actually, lately, because they chalked it up to parental negligence.

1069
01:26:12,614 --> 01:26:17,797
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be interesting to see how the Supreme Court goes on this one though because it definitely will set a precedent, if nothing else.

1070
01:26:18,513 --> 01:26:30,260
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, and though they're going to have to go by previous precedent set, like what was that public decency thing that ended up being a free speech?

1071
01:26:30,581 --> 01:26:38,986
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, there was in Florida, there's a boob march every year, and it's allowed to go through as freedom of expression.

1072
01:26:39,847 --> 01:26:43,049
[SPEAKER_09]: If we can have boobs flapping around in humidity...

1073
01:26:43,989 --> 01:26:45,551
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that we can have a little... Wet boobs?

1074
01:26:46,311 --> 01:26:49,454
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we can have a little headshot, don't you think?

1075
01:26:50,715 --> 01:26:54,138
[SPEAKER_11]: I support this and I think that this should expand across the country.

1076
01:26:55,459 --> 01:26:56,160
[SPEAKER_11]: I support this.

1077
01:26:56,200 --> 01:26:56,440
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree.

1078
01:26:56,460 --> 01:26:57,721
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki's like, why are we talking about games?

1079
01:26:57,761 --> 01:26:59,062
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk more about the boob march.

1080
01:26:59,503 --> 01:27:02,926
[SPEAKER_09]: It was something having to do with people who, you know, were...

1081
01:27:04,651 --> 01:27:05,091
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

1082
01:27:28,985 --> 01:27:30,045
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't want to see your boobies.

1083
01:27:30,846 --> 01:27:34,327
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why they make shawls and covers.

1084
01:27:35,507 --> 01:27:36,107
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm being difficult.

1085
01:27:36,167 --> 01:27:36,948
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, I want to see.

1086
01:27:37,808 --> 01:27:38,268
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever.

1087
01:27:38,468 --> 01:27:39,348
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't need to go in there.

1088
01:27:39,548 --> 01:27:40,929
[SPEAKER_03]: She's just like, I don't want to show you anyway.

1089
01:27:41,289 --> 01:27:41,609
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1090
01:27:42,129 --> 01:27:43,010
[SPEAKER_03]: My boobs are epic.

1091
01:27:43,570 --> 01:27:44,170
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on.

1092
01:27:45,310 --> 01:27:46,711
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got a lot of show in the interest of time.

1093
01:27:46,731 --> 01:27:47,971
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got to get on release dates.

1094
01:27:48,011 --> 01:27:51,732
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about what violent games are coming to a store near you this week.

1095
01:27:52,533 --> 01:27:53,013
[SPEAKER_03]: Start with the U.S.

1096
01:27:53,233 --> 01:27:54,853
[SPEAKER_11]: Not really many violent games this week.

1097
01:27:55,173 --> 01:27:56,474
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's not too much.

1098
01:27:57,294 --> 01:27:58,035
[SPEAKER_11]: of a release week.

1099
01:27:58,475 --> 01:28:01,698
[SPEAKER_11]: It is going to start ramping up though very soon, but there are some decent things.

1100
01:28:02,058 --> 01:28:11,025
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a re-release of Battlefield Bad Company 2, the Ultimate Edition with some download content there for both Battlefield Bad Company 2 and Battlefield 1943 in there as well.

1101
01:28:12,546 --> 01:28:15,268
[SPEAKER_11]: Valkyria Chronicles 2 on the PSP.

1102
01:28:16,249 --> 01:28:19,652
[SPEAKER_11]: Gunblade New York City and LA Machine Guns on the Wii this week.

1103
01:28:21,193 --> 01:28:23,875
[SPEAKER_11]: Metroid Other M on the Wii this week, which is

1104
01:28:24,655 --> 01:28:52,348
[SPEAKER_11]: awesome Camp Rock the final jam on the DS tying in with the movie that's coming out and I hope they really do mean final because I don't care for those Camp Rock games or anything with Disney as far as our TV shows go Guilty Party on the Wii it wants to be Clue but it's just not Prison Tycoon Alcatraz I think a lot of this stuff was delayed from last week because I remember reading a bunch of this

1105
01:28:53,396 --> 01:29:00,060
[SPEAKER_11]: The Mumbo Jumbo Six Pack Second Edition with a bunch of different Mumbo Jumbo puzzle and card games in there as well.

1106
01:29:01,180 --> 01:29:09,885
[SPEAKER_11]: And what probably is going to be a really shitty game, We Wish You a Merry Christmas for the Wii.

1107
01:29:11,346 --> 01:29:12,907
[SPEAKER_11]: It's fucking August.

1108
01:29:13,027 --> 01:29:18,710
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's a re-release because honestly, yeah, it is a re-release and it's $10 now.

1109
01:29:19,170 --> 01:29:20,371
[SPEAKER_11]: And trust me, it's not worth $10.

1110
01:29:22,372 --> 01:29:22,912
[SPEAKER_11]: That is it.

1111
01:29:23,152 --> 01:29:24,393
[SPEAKER_11]: Next week will be some good stuff though.

1112
01:29:25,333 --> 01:29:27,754
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go over to Japan and check out what's coming out over there.

1113
01:29:28,174 --> 01:29:30,735
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of price reductions this week on the Xbox.

1114
01:29:30,815 --> 01:29:37,738
[SPEAKER_03]: Left 4 Dead 2, Halo 3 ODST, Modern Warfare 2, and Bayonetta all going into the Platinum Collection over there in Japan.

1115
01:29:38,058 --> 01:29:40,399
[SPEAKER_03]: And those are really the only releases to look forward to this week.

1116
01:29:40,459 --> 01:29:46,441
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of a similar situation where we're just kind of waiting for the big rush at the end of the year which will start any day now.

1117
01:29:47,121 --> 01:29:58,432
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on to the PlayStation 3, same thing, lots of price reductions, but that includes NBA Live 10, Need for Speed Shift, FIFA Soccer 10, World Class Soccer, Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2, and Bayonetta.

1118
01:29:58,873 --> 01:29:59,694
[SPEAKER_03]: That's on the PlayStation 3.

1119
01:29:59,934 --> 01:30:03,778
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, these are Japanese releases or price reductions as the case may be.

1120
01:30:04,378 --> 01:30:06,219
[SPEAKER_03]: as things move into the Platinum Series over there.

1121
01:30:07,179 --> 01:30:11,080
[SPEAKER_03]: Looking at the Nintendo Wii, big releases over there this week.

1122
01:30:11,120 --> 01:30:15,781
[SPEAKER_03]: Just Metroid Other M gets its release on September 2nd, so it's coming out over there this week as well.

1123
01:30:15,801 --> 01:30:19,002
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't really get it earlier or later, just a couple days later, I guess, if you want to be technical.

1124
01:30:19,762 --> 01:30:21,523
[SPEAKER_03]: PlayStation 2 doesn't have a whole lot going on.

1125
01:30:21,563 --> 01:30:29,745
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a new FIFA Soccer 10 coming out there, and Shin Sangoku Musou 5 Special gets a price reduction, if you're into that.

1126
01:30:30,225 --> 01:30:30,905
[SPEAKER_11]: Cthulhu Saves the World Xbox 360

1127
01:30:49,953 --> 01:30:58,322
[SPEAKER_11]: There are so many things wrong with that because Cthulhu never really saves anything unless it's saving by cleansing all humanity off of the world.

1128
01:30:59,984 --> 01:31:01,766
[SPEAKER_11]: But maybe that's coming out on 360 this week.

1129
01:31:02,066 --> 01:31:03,507
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe an Xbox Live Arcade game.

1130
01:31:03,988 --> 01:31:04,328
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

1131
01:31:04,528 --> 01:31:04,849
[SPEAKER_11]: Who knows?

1132
01:31:05,189 --> 01:31:06,010
[SPEAKER_11]: But that's an awesome name.

1133
01:31:06,971 --> 01:31:07,211
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1134
01:31:07,251 --> 01:31:11,976
[SPEAKER_03]: Also in Japan this week on the Nintendo DS, a game called Nintama Rantaru.

1135
01:31:13,103 --> 01:31:15,766
[SPEAKER_03]: Gakunen Taikosuen Puzzle No Dawn

1136
01:31:29,640 --> 01:31:45,993
[SPEAKER_03]: then lastly going on to the Sony PSP and seeing if anything is coming out over there worth mentioning Bleach, Heat the Soul 7 because you know you've missed your Bleach games so there's another one coming out on PSP this week also a game called White Breath Perfect Edition comes out this week as well on the PSP

1137
01:31:47,494 --> 01:31:48,634
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called White Breath.

1138
01:31:49,675 --> 01:31:51,196
[SPEAKER_03]: It is an adventure game.

1139
01:31:52,036 --> 01:31:53,977
[SPEAKER_03]: Trying to figure out if it's a dating sim or what.

1140
01:31:54,017 --> 01:32:00,240
[SPEAKER_03]: It's another one of those kind of like read and respond to the characters as they're talking to you.

1141
01:32:00,260 --> 01:32:01,921
[SPEAKER_03]: There's so many Japanese games that look like this.

1142
01:32:02,342 --> 01:32:02,882
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can choose.

1143
01:32:02,942 --> 01:32:04,082
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like there's a music mode.

1144
01:32:04,102 --> 01:32:05,763
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a music song called Slapstick.

1145
01:32:06,444 --> 01:32:06,924
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, whatever.

1146
01:32:06,964 --> 01:32:07,324
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

1147
01:32:07,364 --> 01:32:08,745
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are your releases in Japan this week.

1148
01:32:09,039 --> 01:32:09,659
[SPEAKER_09]: How about Europe?

1149
01:32:10,600 --> 01:32:12,161
[SPEAKER_09]: We do have some goodies in Europe.

1150
01:32:12,481 --> 01:32:18,645
[SPEAKER_09]: On the 31st, Bioshock 2 Minerva's Den on PS3, PC, Xbox 360.

1151
01:32:19,486 --> 01:32:22,187
[SPEAKER_09]: Dead Rising 2 Case Zero on Xbox 360.

1152
01:32:23,288 --> 01:32:30,633
[SPEAKER_09]: On September 3rd we have Metroid Other M and Tom Clancy's Hawk 2 and Valkyria Chronicles.

1153
01:32:31,473 --> 01:32:34,095
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's going to be a week of excitement.

1154
01:32:35,999 --> 01:32:39,871
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, just a few more news stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week.

1155
01:32:42,020 --> 01:32:42,420
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1156
01:32:43,561 --> 01:32:44,041
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see.

1157
01:32:44,101 --> 01:32:45,582
[SPEAKER_11]: There's some other cool stuff here.

1158
01:32:46,582 --> 01:32:47,283
[SPEAKER_11]: It's interesting.

1159
01:32:47,323 --> 01:32:56,307
[SPEAKER_11]: This week there was a lot of talk about used game stuff, despite the fact THQ thinks you're all cheaters for buying used games.

1160
01:32:56,387 --> 01:33:02,250
[SPEAKER_11]: But apparently some of their direct customers are going to be cheaters as well.

1161
01:33:03,351 --> 01:33:05,912
[SPEAKER_11]: Target is actually buying used games.

1162
01:33:05,952 --> 01:33:07,993
[SPEAKER_11]: They started their used game buying program.

1163
01:33:09,133 --> 01:33:17,118
[SPEAKER_11]: It's actually kind of taking place right now in Northern California, but they're going to be rolling out 850 stores by the year's end.

1164
01:33:17,839 --> 01:33:22,121
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not really sure how that program works, but that'll be interesting.

1165
01:33:24,796 --> 01:33:25,516
[SPEAKER_11]: Best Buy Best Buy

1166
01:33:43,261 --> 01:33:47,584
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, now they've actually begun doing used game trade-ins as well.

1167
01:33:48,204 --> 01:33:54,348
[SPEAKER_11]: And they also have, I guess, $20 gift cards for select titles.

1168
01:33:54,608 --> 01:34:02,773
[SPEAKER_11]: If you, you know, buy or trade in a certain game, they'll give you $20, I guess, addition.

1169
01:34:04,194 --> 01:34:09,858
[SPEAKER_11]: And, oh, I guess they'll give you $20 instead of the title's trade-in value.

1170
01:34:09,998 --> 01:34:11,999
[SPEAKER_11]: But, hey, $20 for games sometimes is pretty good.

1171
01:34:14,368 --> 01:34:41,276
[SPEAKER_11]: and um so yeah it's interesting so I'm sure if these guys you know start doing this that probably other retailers especially if they're successful with it will won't be too far behind and then everybody will be cheaters and what will you think then THQ I think they'll probably poop themselves uh anybody planning to take advantage of these programs

1172
01:34:42,523 --> 01:34:43,603
[SPEAKER_11]: No, not really.

1173
01:35:11,448 --> 01:35:12,089
[SPEAKER_03]: Episode 2, Two Households

1174
01:35:29,858 --> 01:35:39,501
[SPEAKER_03]: They're saying it will have better pathfinding, the option to switch between extended and short narration, a new walking animation, more subtitle options, and widescreen support.

1175
01:35:39,881 --> 01:35:43,122
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess it sounds like they've taken a lot of feedback from the first game and implemented it.

1176
01:35:43,162 --> 01:35:43,802
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's really cool.

1177
01:35:44,682 --> 01:35:54,085
[SPEAKER_03]: In a related story, the website GOG.com, G-O-G.com or goodoldgames.com, they're having a Keen's Quest 1 through 3 bundle selling right now for $9.99.

1178
01:35:55,185 --> 01:35:56,586
[SPEAKER_03]: There's also a pack with 4, 5, and 6 bundles.

1179
01:35:57,566 --> 01:35:58,346
[SPEAKER_03]: with the same price.

1180
01:35:58,366 --> 01:35:59,887
[SPEAKER_03]: You ever looked at GOG.com?

1181
01:35:59,927 --> 01:36:12,994
[SPEAKER_03]: They actually have quite a few old, old games for sale on there and a good way to get legitimate what I've seen called abandonware before when people just put up old games because they say it's old and no one cares about it anymore.

1182
01:36:13,014 --> 01:36:14,235
[SPEAKER_09]: As long as it's not Game.com.

1183
01:36:15,755 --> 01:36:16,296
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's not that.

1184
01:36:16,316 --> 01:36:18,577
[SPEAKER_09]: I had one of those and the taco and got rid of them both.

1185
01:36:19,295 --> 01:36:20,196
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1186
01:36:41,144 --> 01:36:41,764
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

1187
01:37:13,567 --> 01:37:15,228
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the theme music from the game.

1188
01:37:15,609 --> 01:37:15,889
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1189
01:37:16,149 --> 01:37:18,031
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, play the theme music from the anime.

1190
01:37:18,551 --> 01:37:19,812
[SPEAKER_03]: Play the theme music from the anime.

1191
01:37:19,913 --> 01:37:20,453
[SPEAKER_03]: I can do that.

1192
01:37:20,473 --> 01:37:20,993
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1193
01:37:21,013 --> 01:37:23,075
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I'm prepared here for a change.

1194
01:37:28,580 --> 01:37:31,102
[SPEAKER_09]: That's actually one of the best qualities I have that I can play into.

1195
01:37:34,805 --> 01:37:35,966
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, does the gun look familiar?

1196
01:37:36,247 --> 01:37:37,268
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, the gun does look familiar.

1197
01:37:37,308 --> 01:37:37,468
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

1198
01:37:37,488 --> 01:37:38,769
[SPEAKER_09]: You can link that in the chat room.

1199
01:37:39,009 --> 01:37:40,010
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure, I'll link this in the chat room.

1200
01:37:40,450 --> 01:37:40,711
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1201
01:37:40,731 --> 01:37:40,811
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1202
01:37:41,733 --> 01:37:46,776
[SPEAKER_09]: The game and the anime Zillion came out as companions to each other.

1203
01:37:46,797 --> 01:37:50,219
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to switch and do some play of the game.

1204
01:37:50,259 --> 01:37:51,280
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, didn't mean to cut you off.

1205
01:37:51,420 --> 01:37:53,361
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool.

1206
01:37:53,981 --> 01:38:02,347
[SPEAKER_09]: Game actually in Japan, its full name is Akai Kodan Zillion, which is Red Photon Zillion.

1207
01:38:03,148 --> 01:38:05,689
[SPEAKER_09]: And it kind of is Metroid-ish.

1208
01:38:05,909 --> 01:38:07,871
[SPEAKER_09]: It came out though before then, I believe.

1209
01:38:08,551 --> 01:38:11,732
[SPEAKER_09]: It was out in 1987 for the Sega Master System.

1210
01:38:12,632 --> 01:38:15,473
[SPEAKER_09]: And there was a sequel called Zillion 2, The Triformation.

1211
01:38:17,674 --> 01:38:21,936
[SPEAKER_09]: It also had things in common with Impossible Mission, too.

1212
01:38:22,436 --> 01:38:31,759
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically, the general story, you play a group called the White Knights, and you have to go get rid of this base on Planet X. So you play...

1213
01:38:32,419 --> 01:38:36,183
[SPEAKER_09]: Main dude, JJ, and you rescue Apple and Champ, who are the other guys.

1214
01:38:36,543 --> 01:38:37,844
[SPEAKER_09]: Keep in mind, early anime.

1215
01:38:38,625 --> 01:38:43,269
[SPEAKER_03]: Just real quick, don't want to cut you off, but since you brought it up, August 6th, 86 was Metroid.

1216
01:38:43,529 --> 01:38:44,650
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so then it was afterwards.

1217
01:38:45,351 --> 01:38:45,611
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1218
01:38:47,896 --> 01:38:59,229
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, you have to go past tripwires, turrets, forcefields, a bunch of enemy guards, including in some places they kind of run in like Metal Gear style.

1219
01:38:59,750 --> 01:39:02,933
[SPEAKER_09]: You hear the little alert noise.

1220
01:39:03,494 --> 01:39:04,015
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's pretty cool.

1221
01:39:04,475 --> 01:39:04,535
[SPEAKER_09]: J.J.

1222
01:39:04,555 --> 01:39:05,976
[SPEAKER_09]: is like a nice balance in between them.

1223
01:39:27,931 --> 01:39:39,036
[SPEAKER_09]: There's also a glitch in the game that you can become invincible by dying when you go into a room-to-room elevator, but you can't go to your status menu.

1224
01:39:40,397 --> 01:39:43,118
[SPEAKER_09]: The only way you can switch characters is when you find a new teammate.

1225
01:39:43,678 --> 01:39:52,122
[SPEAKER_09]: And of course, remember this is the Master System, it is kind of inconvenient to go pause your game on the system like it was back in the day.

1226
01:39:53,223 --> 01:39:53,323
[SPEAKER_09]: Um...

1227
01:39:55,684 --> 01:40:04,771
[SPEAKER_09]: But the music is, of course, a lot the same music from the anime.

1228
01:40:05,152 --> 01:40:10,416
[SPEAKER_09]: And the one where you go in and out of their main ship, it plays the opening theme from the anime.

1229
01:40:11,177 --> 01:40:13,498
[SPEAKER_09]: And it plays it when the Sega label goes off.

1230
01:40:13,959 --> 01:40:14,339
[SPEAKER_09]: And then...

1231
01:40:15,940 --> 01:40:16,461
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty cool.

1232
01:40:16,481 --> 01:40:20,863
[SPEAKER_09]: It's got a soundtrack called Akai Kodanzillion Let It Rock, which I have.

1233
01:40:21,643 --> 01:40:22,264
[SPEAKER_09]: Just saying.

1234
01:40:23,444 --> 01:40:24,965
[SPEAKER_09]: And the anime's pretty good, too, actually.

1235
01:40:25,585 --> 01:40:38,632
[SPEAKER_09]: But the game is... It's got a lot of different special messages in it, and you have... The way that you go through those rooms is that you have these little pods that you have to blow up and get a character out of, and then you input them into a computer.

1236
01:40:38,652 --> 01:40:40,793
[SPEAKER_09]: And the characters don't have to be in any particular order, by the way.

1237
01:40:42,975 --> 01:40:49,781
[SPEAKER_09]: and then you'll get like some special codes that will summon, you know, will turn off the tripwires or something and they do other stuff.

1238
01:40:50,581 --> 01:40:52,603
[SPEAKER_03]: This more reminds me of Impossible Mission.

1239
01:40:52,623 --> 01:40:54,024
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I said earlier.

1240
01:40:54,064 --> 01:40:56,446
[SPEAKER_09]: I said that it has a lot in common with Impossible Mission.

1241
01:40:56,466 --> 01:40:58,107
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.

1242
01:40:58,408 --> 01:40:59,849
[SPEAKER_03]: Just having looked at this for a little bit now, yeah.

1243
01:41:01,387 --> 01:41:05,668
[SPEAKER_09]: But keep in mind, this is a pretty, pretty sweet game.

1244
01:41:05,888 --> 01:41:08,929
[SPEAKER_09]: And it doesn't have a save function, sadly.

1245
01:41:09,429 --> 01:41:14,010
[SPEAKER_09]: Dan left his game paused while he was playing it for hours on end so he could do other stuff.

1246
01:41:15,331 --> 01:41:20,112
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'd have to say it's among the list of, you know, one of my favorites.

1247
01:41:20,152 --> 01:41:24,073
[SPEAKER_09]: And also keep in mind, there's a little guest star in Zillion.

1248
01:41:25,273 --> 01:41:26,314
[SPEAKER_09]: There's the Opa Opa.

1249
01:41:27,194 --> 01:41:27,494
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

1250
01:41:27,514 --> 01:41:27,594
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1251
01:41:28,294 --> 01:41:37,459
[SPEAKER_09]: When you're... Because you can shoot different of those little, you know, pods and get power-ups and one of your power-ups is an OPA-OPA and it gives you a level up.

1252
01:41:39,780 --> 01:41:41,561
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's just a little icon of an OPA-OPA.

1253
01:41:45,062 --> 01:41:46,483
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think this is alternate audio.

1254
01:41:46,503 --> 01:41:47,343
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think that's actually the game.

1255
01:41:47,383 --> 01:41:49,024
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that one, if this one I'm thinking of, that is.

1256
01:41:49,344 --> 01:41:52,626
[SPEAKER_09]: They said they unsynced and had to use different music.

1257
01:41:52,926 --> 01:41:53,166
[SPEAKER_07]: Dope.

1258
01:41:53,726 --> 01:41:54,187
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, um...

1259
01:41:57,648 --> 01:42:01,170
[SPEAKER_09]: If you watch the anime too, there's little scenes where the Opa Opa is hanging out with them.

1260
01:42:02,611 --> 01:42:04,452
[SPEAKER_03]: Some little references.

1261
01:42:04,652 --> 01:42:05,413
[SPEAKER_03]: Fantasy Zone.

1262
01:42:05,473 --> 01:42:05,773
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

1263
01:42:06,193 --> 01:42:09,095
[SPEAKER_09]: And of course we know what Fantasy Zone also had to do with.

1264
01:42:09,955 --> 01:42:10,836
[SPEAKER_09]: Space Harrier.

1265
01:42:11,837 --> 01:42:13,758
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe we should have Seven Degrees of Space Harrier.

1266
01:42:14,458 --> 01:42:15,439
[SPEAKER_03]: Could be a new game to play.

1267
01:42:15,719 --> 01:42:15,939
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1268
01:42:16,179 --> 01:42:16,860
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well there it is.

1269
01:42:16,880 --> 01:42:18,020
[SPEAKER_03]: Your classic game of the week.

1270
01:42:18,220 --> 01:42:20,102
[SPEAKER_03]: Zillion for the Sega Master System.

1271
01:42:20,602 --> 01:42:21,182
[SPEAKER_03]: Go play it.

1272
01:42:21,282 --> 01:42:21,763
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fun.

1273
01:42:22,043 --> 01:42:22,343
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1274
01:42:23,833 --> 01:42:27,594
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see what she picks next week because you still get one for the marathon show.

1275
01:42:27,935 --> 01:42:29,175
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we might have to actually play it.

1276
01:42:29,475 --> 01:42:30,215
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we should.

1277
01:42:30,495 --> 01:42:30,876
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

1278
01:42:31,176 --> 01:42:33,536
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to dig into the closet and go obscure.

1279
01:42:33,556 --> 01:42:34,377
[SPEAKER_03]: It better not suck.

1280
01:42:34,397 --> 01:42:35,617
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I'm saying.

1281
01:42:36,597 --> 01:42:36,898
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1282
01:42:37,558 --> 01:42:39,498
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to take a quick break here at Orange Laundry.

1283
01:42:39,558 --> 01:42:42,519
[SPEAKER_09]: Just for that, I'm going to make Rob play through Bungaio by himself on one man.

1284
01:42:42,639 --> 01:42:42,940
[SPEAKER_09]: Why?

1285
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:43,740
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would you do that?

1286
01:42:45,428 --> 01:42:48,390
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, we're going to take a quick break here at Orange Lounge Radio, but don't go anywhere.

1287
01:42:48,430 --> 01:42:50,991
[SPEAKER_03]: We will be right back with plenty more news stories.

1288
01:42:51,511 --> 01:42:54,093
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got your Twitter topics coming too, so make sure you get those in on Twitter.

1289
01:42:54,413 --> 01:42:58,855
[SPEAKER_03]: Your emails and phone calls all when we get back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1290
01:43:05,515 --> 01:43:08,137
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

1291
01:43:08,197 --> 01:43:11,540
[SPEAKER_03]: We are taping live on this Sunday evening, August the 29th of 2010.

1292
01:43:12,080 --> 01:43:19,806
[SPEAKER_03]: It is the 379th episode of our show and lots of folks in our chatroom talking about the upcoming marathon last week.

1293
01:43:20,106 --> 01:43:26,691
[SPEAKER_03]: Some folks asking, Robert M is asking in chat, any chance of the marathon being on the podcast or would there be licensed music being used?

1294
01:43:27,612 --> 01:43:30,013
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now I don't see why it wouldn't be podcast.

1295
01:43:30,033 --> 01:43:33,216
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean I guess it depends on what happens and the legality of what happens.

1296
01:43:33,896 --> 01:43:35,216
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't see why not.

1297
01:43:35,276 --> 01:43:41,678
[SPEAKER_03]: It will probably be labeled separately so that those folks, you know, because not everybody's going to want to hear it because it's going to have a different flow.

1298
01:43:42,178 --> 01:43:48,840
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not going to be as, dare I say it, polished as this show is, which you know is going to be really bad.

1299
01:43:49,560 --> 01:43:53,621
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, I'm going to label it differently, but it'll be there, I mean, for folks to download.

1300
01:43:53,681 --> 01:43:59,983
[SPEAKER_03]: But those folks that aren't really interested in the excess will be able to just get the regular three-hour show and move on with it.

1301
01:44:01,035 --> 01:44:25,719
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, that's what we're aiming for right now anyway We'll let you know for sure, of course, after we tape next week Anyhow, we've got more news to get into And of course we're going to get your Twitter topics here in just a minute And the FUs of the week, the mailbag, all those fun segments Phone calls coming up too But first, quick, quick, quick news There's just so much to talk about this week We just don't have time to spend 10 minutes on everything But Loki, what do we want to talk about quickly?

1302
01:44:26,581 --> 01:44:28,623
[SPEAKER_11]: This is Vegas is apparently cancelled.

1303
01:44:28,683 --> 01:44:33,366
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a game that was being developed by Surreal Software for Midway.

1304
01:44:33,386 --> 01:44:37,589
[SPEAKER_11]: But of course when Midway closed down it was then bought up by Warner Brothers Interactive.

1305
01:44:38,130 --> 01:44:40,211
[SPEAKER_11]: The premise of the game was retarded as it was.

1306
01:44:40,371 --> 01:44:46,336
[SPEAKER_11]: It's basically you going to Vegas, dancing, driving fast cars, punching people, and gambling.

1307
01:44:47,056 --> 01:44:51,259
[SPEAKER_11]: And apparently the game is rumored to have cost $43 million to make.

1308
01:44:54,028 --> 01:44:55,889
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow, what a waste of money that was.

1309
01:44:56,469 --> 01:44:59,431
[SPEAKER_11]: But no confirmation whether it's coming.

1310
01:44:59,851 --> 01:45:02,393
[SPEAKER_11]: It's actually canceled or not, but who gives a crap?

1311
01:45:03,193 --> 01:45:05,154
[SPEAKER_11]: What are you talking about?

1312
01:45:05,174 --> 01:45:06,895
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I do every time I go visit Tiara.

1313
01:45:08,096 --> 01:45:08,536
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly.

1314
01:45:09,877 --> 01:45:12,858
[SPEAKER_11]: Why would you want to play a game that do that?

1315
01:45:13,198 --> 01:45:14,479
[SPEAKER_11]: I just don't understand.

1316
01:45:14,819 --> 01:45:22,744
[SPEAKER_11]: The Homebrew Channel, it's been something that's been kind of a staple of the homebrew community on the Wii.

1317
01:45:23,624 --> 01:45:36,204
[SPEAKER_11]: for quite a while now since the release of homebrew channel version 1.07 they have added anonymous user statistics to the homebrew channel

1318
01:45:39,353 --> 01:46:01,492
[SPEAKER_11]: And apparently they have detected about 200,000 people using the homebrew channel on the Wii So that's kind of cool And unsurprisingly I guess the top country using this would be the USA Followed by France, Germany, Spain, and the Great Britain Um

1319
01:46:04,182 --> 01:46:13,231
[SPEAKER_11]: and it's interesting though that with that many systems out there there's not really a lot of people that use kind of the homebrew channel for stuff.

1320
01:46:13,871 --> 01:46:21,638
[SPEAKER_11]: So maybe the hacking and piracy stuff on the Wii isn't as prevalent as they think it is.

1321
01:46:22,319 --> 01:46:26,263
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course there's other methods for that but it's interesting nonetheless.

1322
01:46:27,584 --> 01:46:29,526
[SPEAKER_11]: And then finally a unique...

1323
01:46:30,715 --> 01:46:31,355
[SPEAKER_11]: MMO Dead State

1324
01:46:47,211 --> 01:46:55,195
[SPEAKER_11]: And I guess that developer is composed of Bethesda and Troika vets.

1325
01:46:56,396 --> 01:47:02,219
[SPEAKER_11]: They've come up with this new RPG set in a fictional town called Splendid, Texas.

1326
01:47:03,019 --> 01:47:31,927
[SPEAKER_11]: and which is in the middle of the grips I guess in the grips of a full on zombie apocalypse and the object is the keep yourself alive and I guess you operate out of a local school which serves as a hub and sanctuary from the horrors of the community and from there you must head out into the wild hunting down supplies and other survivors and of course using those resources to beef up your base there

1327
01:47:32,667 --> 01:47:55,239
[SPEAKER_11]: and of course there's tons of zombies and not everybody that you find will be friendly or sane for that matter and combat is supposed to be turn based and you'll be able to issue commands to whole groups or individuals as well so that's supposed to be headed out on a PC sometime I guess relatively soon

1328
01:47:56,400 --> 01:47:59,403
[SPEAKER_03]: Taking a step backward here real quick in chat, but it's a good chat comment.

1329
01:47:59,644 --> 01:48:09,255
[SPEAKER_03]: TigerClaw in our chat says, and those who pirate games, some people have been playing Metroid Other M on JustinTV, and I noticed one playing a pirated version that was loaded from the Homebrew channel.

1330
01:48:10,496 --> 01:48:11,257
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure there are.

1331
01:48:11,317 --> 01:48:14,902
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been leaked out since last week, so I wouldn't be surprised.

1332
01:48:15,563 --> 01:48:15,863
[SPEAKER_11]: Yikes.

1333
01:48:16,464 --> 01:48:19,048
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well, moving on to some other quick news here.

1334
01:48:19,228 --> 01:48:22,112
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm talking about another game coming out from Sony.

1335
01:48:22,753 --> 01:48:24,395
[SPEAKER_03]: It's up on PlayStation Japan.

1336
01:48:24,495 --> 01:48:32,266
[SPEAKER_03]: There's apparently a teaser page, and on this page you see this Japanese guy sitting in a tuxedo, and it looks like he's knitting.

1337
01:48:33,255 --> 01:48:34,695
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like the Godfather.

1338
01:48:34,996 --> 01:48:41,397
[SPEAKER_03]: It is what it looks like, but it's on PlayStation Japan, and EA owns the rights to Godfather, but the Godfather is knitting.

1339
01:48:43,078 --> 01:48:44,258
[SPEAKER_11]: It's for LittleBigPlanet 2.

1340
01:48:45,158 --> 01:48:45,558
[SPEAKER_11]: You think?

1341
01:48:45,998 --> 01:48:47,539
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it's been confirmed that's what it's for.

1342
01:48:47,599 --> 01:48:48,379
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

1343
01:48:48,399 --> 01:48:51,320
[SPEAKER_11]: Because he's crocheting a sack boy.

1344
01:48:52,140 --> 01:48:56,481
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's just funny, because if you actually go to the page, there's an animation of him crocheting.

1345
01:48:56,701 --> 01:48:57,001
[SPEAKER_03]: Cute.

1346
01:48:57,602 --> 01:48:57,802
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1347
01:48:57,982 --> 01:48:58,642
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, I get it.

1348
01:48:58,682 --> 01:48:59,102
[SPEAKER_03]: That's funny.

1349
01:48:59,542 --> 01:49:02,384
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1350
01:49:25,026 --> 01:49:29,871
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, the theme song to Zombies is now available on Rock Band Network.

1351
01:49:30,872 --> 01:49:36,198
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, if that wasn't enough, you're soon going to be able to get Zombies shirts and Hot Topic.

1352
01:49:37,018 --> 01:49:39,301
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you know Hot Topic loves to get in on that trendy stuff.

1353
01:49:40,062 --> 01:49:41,043
[SPEAKER_03]: And I love this shirt here.

1354
01:49:41,063 --> 01:49:42,604
[SPEAKER_03]: It just says, Zombies!

1355
01:49:42,885 --> 01:49:45,407
[SPEAKER_03]: With a big exclamation, exclamation, one.

1356
01:49:45,988 --> 01:49:46,368
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

1357
01:49:49,913 --> 01:49:52,935
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, real quickly, some music game news updates.

1358
01:49:53,035 --> 01:49:56,396
[SPEAKER_03]: Beatmania 2DX18 called Resort Anthem.

1359
01:49:56,456 --> 01:49:57,077
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, right?

1360
01:49:57,117 --> 01:49:58,337
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, wow, they got far.

1361
01:49:58,377 --> 01:49:59,478
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't matter what it's called.

1362
01:49:59,498 --> 01:50:00,638
[SPEAKER_03]: 2DX Sports Resort.

1363
01:50:01,299 --> 01:50:03,260
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll always be 18th style to me.

1364
01:50:03,640 --> 01:50:05,401
[SPEAKER_03]: But Resort Anthem has a release date.

1365
01:50:05,421 --> 01:50:06,321
[SPEAKER_03]: It's September 15th.

1366
01:50:06,941 --> 01:50:07,342
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

1367
01:50:07,442 --> 01:50:09,923
[SPEAKER_03]: And all those no arcades, it'll import that here in the U.S.

1368
01:50:10,526 --> 01:50:15,789
[SPEAKER_03]: And then lastly, DDRX2 is going to be location tested very soon in Joy-Z.

1369
01:50:16,970 --> 01:50:18,490
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have the specifics on where.

1370
01:50:18,651 --> 01:50:20,191
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm hoping somebody in our chatroom can fill me in.

1371
01:50:20,231 --> 01:50:22,553
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, my little newsy link is... Oh, there we go.

1372
01:50:22,733 --> 01:50:24,214
[SPEAKER_03]: On the border with lots of skee-ball.

1373
01:50:24,354 --> 01:50:25,735
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't working a minute ago.

1374
01:50:25,835 --> 01:50:29,577
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it actually is going to be at Funplex in East Hanover, New Jersey.

1375
01:50:30,357 --> 01:50:30,957
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where it's at.

1376
01:50:32,538 --> 01:50:35,020
[SPEAKER_03]: Enjoy if you live in Joy-Z or nearby.

1377
01:50:36,060 --> 01:50:37,721
[SPEAKER_03]: Go play some X2 and let us know what you think.

1378
01:50:38,101 --> 01:50:38,582
[SPEAKER_03]: Dark Sakura.

1379
01:50:39,491 --> 01:50:41,292
[SPEAKER_09]: I got your news right here.

1380
01:50:42,752 --> 01:50:49,935
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, there's a rumor going that for Marvel vs. Capcom 3 that Crimson Viper is going to be a character in it.

1381
01:50:51,635 --> 01:51:00,439
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think it's looking at this outline and the way that they have it done on the site that I think it's actually very likely Crimson Viper.

1382
01:51:00,519 --> 01:51:04,640
[SPEAKER_09]: They just masked her out and showed the silhouette and it fits perfectly.

1383
01:51:05,521 --> 01:51:05,661
[SPEAKER_09]: And

1384
01:51:06,981 --> 01:51:11,026
[SPEAKER_09]: So, um, I don't, she's cheap.

1385
01:51:11,126 --> 01:51:12,227
[SPEAKER_09]: Why put her in the game?

1386
01:51:12,507 --> 01:51:13,829
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do people hate her so much?

1387
01:51:13,869 --> 01:51:17,233
[SPEAKER_03]: I was reading the comments on that site and there's a lot of hate for Crimson Viper.

1388
01:51:17,253 --> 01:51:18,234
[SPEAKER_03]: She's a cheap whore?

1389
01:51:18,915 --> 01:51:21,217
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, a lot of characters in Street Fighter are cheap whores.

1390
01:51:21,237 --> 01:51:22,158
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what that game's all about.

1391
01:51:22,178 --> 01:51:23,360
[SPEAKER_03]: She's a masher's paradise?

1392
01:51:24,269 --> 01:51:25,070
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds good to me.

1393
01:51:25,390 --> 01:51:26,651
[SPEAKER_03]: She's Eddie Gordo.

1394
01:51:27,511 --> 01:51:29,633
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to love Eddie Gordo in Tekken 3.

1395
01:51:30,213 --> 01:51:30,653
[SPEAKER_03]: Mash her.

1396
01:51:30,753 --> 01:51:31,194
[SPEAKER_11]: And what?

1397
01:51:31,374 --> 01:51:31,774
[SPEAKER_11]: And what?

1398
01:51:31,914 --> 01:51:38,599
[SPEAKER_11]: So what are you going to do when you have, you know, Tekken versus Street Fighter or whatever, and you can do Eddie Gordo versus Crimson Viper?

1399
01:51:38,619 --> 01:51:39,899
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.

1400
01:51:39,940 --> 01:51:40,480
[SPEAKER_11]: What he said.

1401
01:51:42,681 --> 01:51:44,362
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, mash, mash, mash, mash, switch.

1402
01:51:44,443 --> 01:51:45,683
[SPEAKER_03]: Mash, mash, mash, mash, switch.

1403
01:51:48,505 --> 01:51:50,426
[SPEAKER_03]: All the buttons on my controller break within a week.

1404
01:51:50,607 --> 01:51:51,487
[SPEAKER_03]: How'd this happen?

1405
01:51:53,108 --> 01:51:54,029
[SPEAKER_09]: What'd you do that for?

1406
01:51:54,929 --> 01:51:56,950
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, how about something for a different game?

1407
01:51:57,030 --> 01:51:59,191
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know when I started talking in LeetSpeak.

1408
01:51:59,231 --> 01:52:00,232
[SPEAKER_03]: How does it happen?

1409
01:52:01,092 --> 01:52:02,072
[SPEAKER_09]: Crackdown 2, Rob.

1410
01:52:02,172 --> 01:52:02,813
[SPEAKER_09]: Crackdown 2.

1411
01:52:03,413 --> 01:52:03,853
[SPEAKER_09]: A.K.A.

1412
01:52:04,273 --> 01:52:05,094
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1413
01:52:05,414 --> 01:52:06,754
[SPEAKER_09]: I like jumping the sequel.

1414
01:52:09,055 --> 01:52:12,177
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically, the new download content is going to be...

1415
01:52:13,897 --> 01:52:16,078
[SPEAKER_09]: It's called Toy Box.

1416
01:52:17,019 --> 01:52:28,143
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's a free version that will have one called Keys to the City, which is an unlock, and the Thruster ability, which is jetpacks for your boot and vehicle tag.

1417
01:52:28,743 --> 01:52:37,667
[SPEAKER_09]: And then if you pay the 560 Microsoft points, then you'll get 5 new weapons, 2 new vehicles, a couple avatar items, 10 new Chivos.

1418
01:52:38,707 --> 01:52:41,208
[SPEAKER_09]: So, according to this, I guess that means achievement, huh?

1419
01:52:42,888 --> 01:52:43,969
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's a stupid word.

1420
01:52:44,029 --> 01:52:46,129
[SPEAKER_09]: It makes me think of Cheetos and now I want some.

1421
01:52:48,550 --> 01:52:54,131
[SPEAKER_03]: Why have Cheetos when you can have those knock-off Cheetos that are like the cheesy poofs?

1422
01:52:55,291 --> 01:52:56,071
[SPEAKER_03]: Cheese puffs.

1423
01:52:56,611 --> 01:52:58,412
[SPEAKER_03]: They sell them in big old bags at Trader Joe's.

1424
01:52:58,852 --> 01:53:01,832
[SPEAKER_03]: They're still cheesy but they're more puffy.

1425
01:53:02,713 --> 01:53:04,453
[SPEAKER_03]: They make me more puffy when I eat them.

1426
01:53:04,813 --> 01:53:05,493
[SPEAKER_09]: How about something else?

1427
01:53:05,953 --> 01:53:06,414
[SPEAKER_03]: How about it?

1428
01:53:07,574 --> 01:53:07,934
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, wait, wait.

1429
01:53:07,954 --> 01:53:08,775
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to say real quick.

1430
01:53:09,495 --> 01:53:25,801
[SPEAKER_03]: If Microsoft knew what they were doing, they would release download content for, I don't know, 400 points, 800 points that would allow you to go into the arena with the announcer and flamethrower him to death and then he'll talk and announce about how he's dying and why would you want to kill me?

1431
01:53:27,045 --> 01:53:30,766
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got a wife and family, peacekeeper, or whatever, agent.

1432
01:53:32,727 --> 01:53:34,227
[SPEAKER_09]: You can bite my butt, boss.

1433
01:53:36,528 --> 01:53:36,788
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway.

1434
01:53:36,848 --> 01:53:38,148
[SPEAKER_11]: It's Robert Stack, okay?

1435
01:53:38,188 --> 01:53:46,950
[SPEAKER_11]: They somehow have downloaded his consciousness into the game, and that's who I picture talking to me, and it makes me all warm and fuzzy inside.

1436
01:53:46,970 --> 01:53:49,231
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but you say Robert Stack, and I think Ultra Magnus.

1437
01:53:50,865 --> 01:53:53,427
[SPEAKER_09]: Because Transformers the movie was awesome.

1438
01:53:53,667 --> 01:53:54,488
[SPEAKER_09]: Not the new ones!

1439
01:53:54,768 --> 01:53:56,049
[SPEAKER_09]: The old school, animated.

1440
01:53:56,649 --> 01:53:56,929
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway.

1441
01:53:57,810 --> 01:53:58,991
[SPEAKER_09]: But we need sad music, Rob.

1442
01:53:59,071 --> 01:54:00,071
[SPEAKER_09]: We need really sad music.

1443
01:54:01,773 --> 01:54:02,233
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, hold on.

1444
01:54:02,273 --> 01:54:03,394
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me get you some sad music.

1445
01:54:03,494 --> 01:54:05,135
[SPEAKER_09]: Or maybe like some Sanctus or something.

1446
01:54:05,155 --> 01:54:06,576
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you fill time while I get you sad music?

1447
01:54:07,397 --> 01:54:11,339
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I know this is supposed to be like a little quick segment.

1448
01:54:11,399 --> 01:54:13,481
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on, hold on.

1449
01:54:13,501 --> 01:54:14,322
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's your sad music.

1450
01:54:16,403 --> 01:54:17,164
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on, work.

1451
01:54:17,364 --> 01:54:17,684
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, wait.

1452
01:54:21,661 --> 01:54:25,222
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh wait, sorry, I got the B-52's Funplex.

1453
01:54:25,422 --> 01:54:28,243
[SPEAKER_09]: I was thinking Funplex earlier, I know.

1454
01:54:28,323 --> 01:54:30,384
[SPEAKER_03]: I got the song for the other story mixed up.

1455
01:54:30,704 --> 01:54:31,504
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh well, make it work.

1456
01:54:31,524 --> 01:54:33,244
[SPEAKER_09]: You can just play this.

1457
01:54:35,465 --> 01:54:41,007
[SPEAKER_09]: We have to say rest in peace to a company who has brought us a bunch of games.

1458
01:54:41,727 --> 01:54:44,548
[SPEAKER_09]: They brought us Space Jam.

1459
01:54:46,929 --> 01:54:48,169
[SPEAKER_09]: They brought us Burnout.

1460
01:54:51,115 --> 01:54:51,955
[SPEAKER_09]: by Acclaim.

1461
01:54:53,276 --> 01:54:56,137
[SPEAKER_09]: Acclaim is going down.

1462
01:54:57,397 --> 01:54:58,377
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought they'd been down for a while.

1463
01:54:58,457 --> 01:54:59,538
[SPEAKER_09]: They're really down now.

1464
01:55:04,619 --> 01:55:05,380
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just gone.

1465
01:55:11,061 --> 01:55:13,722
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob, you are a sick puppy.

1466
01:55:16,023 --> 01:55:16,803
[SPEAKER_09]: Sick puppy!

1467
01:55:18,424 --> 01:55:18,964
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, Acclaim.

1468
01:55:20,259 --> 01:55:30,652
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, yeah, basically the deal is that Howard Marks bought the name and tried to reboot it as a free-to-play games portal.

1469
01:55:31,053 --> 01:55:31,613
[SPEAKER_11]: It was terrible.

1470
01:55:32,094 --> 01:55:33,876
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and crash and burn.

1471
01:55:34,597 --> 01:55:36,139
[SPEAKER_09]: I think you can go to the site and get refunds.

1472
01:55:37,501 --> 01:55:37,761
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway.

1473
01:55:39,571 --> 01:55:41,573
[SPEAKER_03]: What was the last big thing Acclaim did?

1474
01:55:41,713 --> 01:55:44,535
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't seen that name since, gosh.

1475
01:55:45,436 --> 01:55:47,438
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome to NBA Jam.

1476
01:55:47,458 --> 01:55:48,358
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't they do Double Dragon?

1477
01:55:48,458 --> 01:55:48,899
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, NBA Jam.

1478
01:55:48,919 --> 01:55:51,281
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say Double Dragon 2 on the NES, I think was them.

1479
01:55:52,362 --> 01:55:52,582
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1480
01:55:52,882 --> 01:56:02,630
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, NBA Jam, though, the last system that was out was, and I think it was, other than download versions, they did one on the PlayStation.

1481
01:56:03,611 --> 01:56:04,071
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they did.

1482
01:56:04,291 --> 01:56:04,632
[SPEAKER_03]: You're right.

1483
01:56:04,972 --> 01:56:08,415
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that we've been looking for that isn't the other version.

1484
01:56:08,666 --> 01:56:09,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Ranma.

1485
01:56:09,906 --> 01:56:11,667
[SPEAKER_03]: Acclaim did BMX XXX.

1486
01:56:11,747 --> 01:56:12,788
[SPEAKER_03]: That was Acclaim.

1487
01:56:13,368 --> 01:56:15,769
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that was the first foot in the grave.

1488
01:56:15,829 --> 01:56:18,210
[SPEAKER_03]: What a fine piece of gaming history that game is.

1489
01:56:19,030 --> 01:56:19,790
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess it was Acclaim.

1490
01:56:20,470 --> 01:56:22,591
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a fun game, okay?

1491
01:56:23,652 --> 01:56:24,252
[SPEAKER_11]: It was fun.

1492
01:56:25,092 --> 01:56:26,293
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's move on, guys.

1493
01:56:26,333 --> 01:56:28,493
[SPEAKER_09]: It was kind of cool dragging a hoe around on your bike.

1494
01:56:29,814 --> 01:56:30,854
[SPEAKER_09]: As in a BMX bike.

1495
01:56:33,015 --> 01:56:35,336
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, let's get into some Twitter topics.

1496
01:56:39,179 --> 01:56:40,220
[SPEAKER_03]: Twitter.com slash OLR

1497
01:56:55,198 --> 01:56:56,779
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Blaze Quinn is announcing this.

1498
01:56:57,480 --> 01:57:00,862
[SPEAKER_03]: I read this earlier in the week and I think this is worth reading.

1499
01:57:01,263 --> 01:57:07,847
[SPEAKER_03]: G4 has announced, according to DJ Blaze Quinn here in this news story, a new show called Bomb Patrol Afghanistan.

1500
01:57:08,488 --> 01:57:09,168
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you heard about this?

1501
01:57:09,228 --> 01:57:13,992
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the show on G4, which I don't know why we're reporting on this on the show.

1502
01:57:14,012 --> 01:57:17,074
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we banned G4 news from the show a while ago, but oh well, moment of weakness.

1503
01:57:17,654 --> 01:57:19,395
[SPEAKER_03]: They've made a show out of the Hurt Locker.

1504
01:57:20,155 --> 01:57:21,355
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the one that won the Oscar.

1505
01:57:21,835 --> 01:57:24,696
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, apparently it is Bomb Patrol Afghanistan.

1506
01:57:24,756 --> 01:57:32,058
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a new series about real-life soldiers who put their lives on the line every day as members of the Explosive Ordnance Disposal.

1507
01:57:32,538 --> 01:57:36,539
[SPEAKER_03]: The show will follow the lives of the EOD team, both at home and in Afghanistan.

1508
01:57:37,060 --> 01:57:37,400
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

1509
01:57:37,420 --> 01:57:41,021
[SPEAKER_03]: All things considered, I don't think it sounds like a bad show.

1510
01:57:41,101 --> 01:57:43,521
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just basically a documentary-ish type of show.

1511
01:57:43,581 --> 01:57:45,422
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's not like they're voting people out or...

1512
01:57:47,256 --> 01:57:51,059
[SPEAKER_09]: You get voted out of Afghanistan!

1513
01:57:51,279 --> 01:57:53,561
[SPEAKER_09]: Sweet!

1514
01:57:54,202 --> 01:57:55,983
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, we're sending you home.

1515
01:57:56,323 --> 01:57:57,284
[SPEAKER_03]: You know why this is news?

1516
01:57:58,085 --> 01:58:00,026
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an interesting show on G4.

1517
01:58:00,527 --> 01:58:02,809
[SPEAKER_03]: But I really don't understand the Hurt Locker connection.

1518
01:58:02,829 --> 01:58:06,091
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I would watch it.

1519
01:58:06,552 --> 01:58:07,893
[SPEAKER_03]: It made that subject...

1520
01:58:09,886 --> 01:58:11,827
[SPEAKER_03]: Put that subject in the public eye, if you will.

1521
01:58:12,507 --> 01:58:13,708
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is just furthering that.

1522
01:58:13,768 --> 01:58:14,308
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I don't know.

1523
01:58:14,328 --> 01:58:15,949
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't necessarily see it as bad news.

1524
01:58:15,989 --> 01:58:20,531
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just not gaming, but how long has G4 not been gaming for?

1525
01:58:20,951 --> 01:58:22,552
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll tell you, a really long time.

1526
01:58:24,133 --> 01:58:33,457
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, also, in somewhat related-ish news, EA is standing by their... Again, this is from a tweet from DJ Blaziken.

1527
01:58:34,117 --> 01:58:38,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Each EA is standing by Medal of Honor's choice to include the Taliban.

1528
01:58:38,920 --> 01:58:43,524
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, a comment here from British Defense Secretary Liam Fox, who criticized the game.

1529
01:58:43,584 --> 01:58:47,426
[SPEAKER_03]: Quote, "...at the hands of the Taliban, children have lost fathers and wives have lost husbands.

1530
01:58:47,746 --> 01:58:52,530
[SPEAKER_03]: It's shocking that someone would think it is acceptable to recreate the acts of the Taliban and British soldiers.

1531
01:58:52,970 --> 01:58:57,673
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard to believe any citizen of our country would wish to buy such a thoroughly un-British game.

1532
01:58:58,074 --> 01:59:02,917
[SPEAKER_03]: I would urge retailers to show their support for our armed forces and ban this tasteless product."

1533
01:59:03,417 --> 01:59:12,668
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, EA standing by it saying, it is a creative risk, but they are not going to let the protesters, quote, compromise our creative vision and what we want to do.

1534
01:59:14,470 --> 01:59:15,531
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't like it, don't buy it.

1535
01:59:16,733 --> 01:59:17,213
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds good to me.

1536
01:59:18,335 --> 01:59:19,336
[SPEAKER_03]: Going back to the tweets.

1537
01:59:22,058 --> 01:59:24,199
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkKisuke says, talk about Reach.

1538
01:59:43,294 --> 01:59:53,247
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, Halo 3 just kind of, it wasn't as, plus the group I used to play with, a bunch of college buddies, like a bunch of them had babies and stuff and they don't want to play video games online anymore.

1539
01:59:54,970 --> 01:59:55,531
[SPEAKER_03]: So there you go.

1540
01:59:56,474 --> 01:59:58,655
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really... I kind of lost interest in the Halo series.

1541
01:59:58,975 --> 01:59:59,755
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll check it out.

1542
02:00:00,035 --> 02:00:01,596
[SPEAKER_03]: If somebody I know buys it, I'll look.

1543
02:00:02,216 --> 02:00:03,336
[SPEAKER_03]: Is Dan getting Halo Reach?

1544
02:00:03,517 --> 02:00:04,817
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys probably aren't getting it, huh?

1545
02:00:05,377 --> 02:00:06,518
[SPEAKER_08]: That depends.

1546
02:00:07,738 --> 02:00:09,239
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, he'll probably get Halo Reach.

1547
02:00:09,939 --> 02:00:11,699
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure it's a popular game.

1548
02:00:12,300 --> 02:00:12,600
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

1549
02:00:14,662 --> 02:00:16,764
[SPEAKER_03]: TigerClaw305 sends us some links.

1550
02:00:18,126 --> 02:00:22,230
[SPEAKER_03]: Real quickly, a Wii balance board used to create a motorized baby buggy.

1551
02:00:22,470 --> 02:00:23,431
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.

1552
02:00:23,752 --> 02:00:24,613
[SPEAKER_03]: How does that work?

1553
02:00:24,913 --> 02:00:29,959
[SPEAKER_11]: It's basically, it's a toddler that can't really, or not even toddler, an infant that can't walk yet.

1554
02:00:30,259 --> 02:00:30,960
[SPEAKER_11]: Who makes the Skynet?

1555
02:00:52,995 --> 02:00:54,077
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a college student.

1556
02:00:54,457 --> 02:00:55,779
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, of course.

1557
02:00:55,919 --> 02:00:57,081
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's awfully cute.

1558
02:00:57,742 --> 02:00:58,062
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1559
02:00:58,943 --> 02:01:00,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, another link from Tigerclaw.

1560
02:01:00,506 --> 02:01:03,530
[SPEAKER_03]: Lenovo developing a motion control console for China.

1561
02:01:04,491 --> 02:01:04,771
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

1562
02:01:05,673 --> 02:01:06,774
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess it's called the E-Box?

1563
02:01:07,575 --> 02:01:11,298
[SPEAKER_03]: The console will also focus less on violence and more on family entertainment.

1564
02:01:30,134 --> 02:01:32,159
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, as does the Kinect.

1565
02:01:33,381 --> 02:01:33,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Oops.

1566
02:01:34,344 --> 02:01:37,050
[SPEAKER_03]: I swear I didn't plan that song to come on, but it's kind of funny in retrospect.

1567
02:01:37,451 --> 02:01:37,671
[SPEAKER_03]: More tweets.

1568
02:01:42,338 --> 02:01:43,498
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe this will be the last one here.

1569
02:01:43,738 --> 02:01:45,559
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no, there's a couple here.

1570
02:01:45,879 --> 02:01:47,899
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkKeysK gets another one in here.

1571
02:01:48,639 --> 02:01:52,140
[SPEAKER_03]: Maxis Dark Spore, a Diablo-style action RPG.

1572
02:01:53,040 --> 02:01:54,200
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know much about Dark Spore.

1573
02:01:54,220 --> 02:01:55,440
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this a game you know a little more about?

1574
02:01:55,760 --> 02:01:56,721
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a combination.

1575
02:01:56,781 --> 02:02:00,741
[SPEAKER_11]: It's basically like Spore, but set in a Diablo-type gameplay.

1576
02:02:00,801 --> 02:02:03,342
[SPEAKER_11]: So you create your character, and it's a hack-and-slash game.

1577
02:02:03,422 --> 02:02:04,362
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that sounds kind of cool.

1578
02:02:04,522 --> 02:02:06,402
[SPEAKER_03]: Maxis is the folks that made Spore, after all.

1579
02:02:06,422 --> 02:02:07,302
[SPEAKER_03]: They also made The Sims.

1580
02:02:07,963 --> 02:02:10,503
[SPEAKER_03]: They've been around a while, because that's basically Will Wright's studio, isn't it?

1581
02:02:10,843 --> 02:02:15,487
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft is linking us to a story Xplay gave Metroid Other M a 2 out of 5 says no need to watch the video

1582
02:02:40,559 --> 02:02:47,405
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, that's some intern at the station trying to keep X-Play relevant by causing a little controversy, I'm sure.

1583
02:02:47,505 --> 02:02:47,905
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't know.

1584
02:02:47,945 --> 02:02:49,327
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe the game is terrible.

1585
02:02:49,387 --> 02:02:49,747
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1586
02:02:50,087 --> 02:02:51,328
[SPEAKER_11]: It didn't get terrible reviews.

1587
02:02:51,348 --> 02:02:52,469
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it looks pretty good.

1588
02:02:52,489 --> 02:02:58,775
[SPEAKER_11]: I think what people didn't like was how sometimes it would switch between the first person and third person view.

1589
02:02:59,335 --> 02:03:04,800
[SPEAKER_11]: Just if you happen to, like, move the controller off the screen, it would just all of a sudden switch back, and that kind of sucked.

1590
02:03:05,560 --> 02:03:10,945
[SPEAKER_11]: and also the fact that you couldn't basically run around in the first person mode so people had gripes about that.

1591
02:03:10,965 --> 02:03:16,069
[SPEAKER_11]: Probably because they've been playing Metroid Prime for a while but whatever, it looks kind of cool.

1592
02:03:17,971 --> 02:03:19,952
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll just go on record and say fuck X-Play.

1593
02:03:20,953 --> 02:03:21,914
[SPEAKER_03]: Lastly, Sterlok.

1594
02:03:22,955 --> 02:03:26,398
[SPEAKER_03]: Pokemon Black and White are the fastest selling DS games in history.

1595
02:03:26,458 --> 02:03:27,559
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's a big surprise.

1596
02:03:28,219 --> 02:03:29,200
[SPEAKER_03]: Links us to this article.

1597
02:03:31,542 --> 02:03:38,926
[SPEAKER_03]: That does confirm, ever since July 31st, 2010, over a million pre-orders for Pokemon Black and White version were taken.

1598
02:03:38,966 --> 02:03:43,689
[SPEAKER_03]: That's 1.08 pre-orders for this game launching September 18th, 2010.

1599
02:03:44,109 --> 02:03:50,052
[SPEAKER_03]: And so Nintendo is saying that it's going to make Pokemon Black and White the fastest selling DS games ever.

1600
02:03:51,153 --> 02:03:53,414
[SPEAKER_03]: See, that's cheating though, because there's two different games there.

1601
02:03:54,355 --> 02:03:55,455
[SPEAKER_03]: But they counted as one.

1602
02:03:55,836 --> 02:03:56,576
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fuzzy math.

1603
02:03:58,143 --> 02:04:00,645
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever, I guess everybody lets him get away with it because it's Pokemans.

1604
02:04:02,707 --> 02:04:07,391
[SPEAKER_03]: TigerClaw wants to point out that Metroid Other M has an 81 on Metacritic.

1605
02:04:08,111 --> 02:04:11,094
[SPEAKER_03]: So that 2 out of 5 seems to be a little bit out of place.

1606
02:04:13,056 --> 02:04:13,316
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow.

1607
02:04:14,082 --> 02:04:16,083
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's move on to some other gaming news.

1608
02:04:16,223 --> 02:04:19,205
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to send us some tweets for next week, twitter.com slash olr.

1609
02:04:39,496 --> 02:04:46,460
[SPEAKER_11]: and, of course, as not a big surprise, Microsoft saying, oh, we're going to ban everybody that's playing Reach.

1610
02:04:46,560 --> 02:04:50,882
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, first off, if you're dumb enough to play online with Reach, then yes, you should be banned anyways.

1611
02:04:51,462 --> 02:04:54,924
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm assuming that this is also considering people that...

1612
02:04:55,524 --> 02:05:17,774
[SPEAKER_11]: Aren't necessarily playing online, but say people that have a JTAG console or something, and have an account that they use for live, and maybe move their account back and forth on a memory unit or something like that, and it would show in your recently played games or something like that, or if you get achievements before the release date, and then they can check out whether you have a modded console or something like that.

1613
02:05:17,934 --> 02:05:21,316
[SPEAKER_11]: So, if you don't want to get banned...

1614
02:05:22,679 --> 02:05:27,362
[SPEAKER_11]: Just don't play with a profile that you use online until it's launched.

1615
02:05:28,283 --> 02:05:32,906
[SPEAKER_11]: And they claim, though, that they can tell the difference between this and with the full version.

1616
02:05:33,126 --> 02:05:38,410
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, if you're really that scared about it, you can always re-download it when it gets leaked out from the disc.

1617
02:05:38,530 --> 02:05:40,431
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I don't know.

1618
02:05:40,651 --> 02:05:44,294
[SPEAKER_11]: But, yeah, so they're threatening to ban people, as they probably would.

1619
02:05:45,314 --> 02:05:46,775
[SPEAKER_11]: This doesn't come as a big surprise, though.

1620
02:05:46,795 --> 02:05:47,195
[SPEAKER_11]: No, not at all.

1621
02:05:47,215 --> 02:05:49,237
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they always want to ban people who are playing the game.

1622
02:05:49,317 --> 02:05:50,918
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, they don't want to say, well...

1623
02:05:51,810 --> 02:05:54,731
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh darn, I guess there's nothing we can do about it.

1624
02:05:54,791 --> 02:05:55,372
[SPEAKER_11]: Steal away.

1625
02:05:55,412 --> 02:05:56,652
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, they're not going to say that.

1626
02:05:56,672 --> 02:05:59,774
[SPEAKER_11]: They're going to be like, we're going to come to your house and set you on fire.

1627
02:05:59,894 --> 02:06:02,975
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, that's the kind of threats that they should be making.

1628
02:06:02,995 --> 02:06:04,416
[SPEAKER_03]: We will destroy you.

1629
02:06:04,436 --> 02:06:08,118
[SPEAKER_11]: If we could make your Xbox do other ring colors, we would.

1630
02:06:08,278 --> 02:06:11,579
[SPEAKER_11]: Your console will get set on fire and burn down your house and kill your cat.

1631
02:06:11,639 --> 02:06:12,180
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right.

1632
02:06:14,381 --> 02:06:16,602
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, Shermie's very well insulated.

1633
02:06:17,631 --> 02:06:18,813
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be funny, though.

1634
02:06:19,274 --> 02:06:21,899
[SPEAKER_11]: They have robot legs built into it.

1635
02:06:21,939 --> 02:06:24,845
[SPEAKER_11]: It just gets up, walks out, and goes back to Microsoft.

1636
02:06:24,945 --> 02:06:27,130
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that's a show I want to see on G4.

1637
02:06:27,250 --> 02:06:28,452
[SPEAKER_03]: Cat vs. Xbox.

1638
02:06:31,058 --> 02:06:32,259
[SPEAKER_09]: We've had that in my house.

1639
02:06:32,599 --> 02:06:32,919
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you?

1640
02:06:33,359 --> 02:06:34,079
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what it was?

1641
02:06:34,399 --> 02:06:34,619
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

1642
02:06:34,820 --> 02:06:37,721
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie taking the vacuum to the Xbox to get the cat hair out of it.

1643
02:06:39,041 --> 02:06:39,261
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

1644
02:06:39,502 --> 02:06:40,062
[SPEAKER_03]: Cat wins.

1645
02:06:40,102 --> 02:06:42,303
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe the cat was laying on top of it because it's warm.

1646
02:06:42,343 --> 02:06:43,343
[SPEAKER_03]: You know that happens quite a bit.

1647
02:06:43,863 --> 02:06:47,385
[SPEAKER_09]: Shermie... It would be too much effort for Shermie to get on top of it.

1648
02:06:47,405 --> 02:06:48,025
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll put it that way.

1649
02:06:48,125 --> 02:06:51,266
[SPEAKER_11]: My cat loves my Xbox 360, especially in the winter.

1650
02:06:51,306 --> 02:06:52,247
[SPEAKER_11]: She'll lay behind it.

1651
02:06:52,927 --> 02:06:58,929
[SPEAKER_11]: but she'll lay so close to it that there's no air flow so I don't really appreciate that too much but she will lay next to it.

1652
02:06:58,969 --> 02:06:59,690
[SPEAKER_11]: That and the computer.

1653
02:06:59,730 --> 02:07:01,871
[SPEAKER_11]: She loves all the hot air being blown out.

1654
02:07:01,931 --> 02:07:02,451
[SPEAKER_03]: They're warm.

1655
02:07:03,031 --> 02:07:03,351
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

1656
02:07:03,631 --> 02:07:08,173
[SPEAKER_11]: Or she'll lay on power supplies you know like those big old transformers because they're super hot.

1657
02:07:08,473 --> 02:07:12,275
[SPEAKER_11]: She's just like laying her head right on them like Katie you're going to electrocute yourself or something.

1658
02:07:12,295 --> 02:07:14,996
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what your cat needs is like an electric blanket or some other source.

1659
02:07:15,016 --> 02:07:15,456
[SPEAKER_09]: No she doesn't.

1660
02:07:15,496 --> 02:07:21,779
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I got for Shermie is this mat that redistributes their own heat and warms the whole thing.

1661
02:07:22,739 --> 02:07:24,119
[SPEAKER_09]: and she loves it and it was like 10 bucks.

1662
02:07:24,179 --> 02:07:31,561
[SPEAKER_11]: She has her little baby bed that she lays in still even though she's like way bigger than it but you know she's spoiled and she doesn't need anything.

1663
02:07:31,901 --> 02:07:32,642
[SPEAKER_11]: Kitten mittens.

1664
02:07:34,002 --> 02:07:36,503
[SPEAKER_11]: Does your cat make too much noise?

1665
02:07:37,223 --> 02:07:38,323
[SPEAKER_11]: Mittens made out of kittens?

1666
02:07:38,363 --> 02:07:39,763
[SPEAKER_11]: Well we got plenty of kittens to do that.

1667
02:07:42,204 --> 02:07:42,524
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

1668
02:07:42,584 --> 02:07:44,204
[SPEAKER_11]: Speaking of which, does anyone want a kitten?

1669
02:07:44,345 --> 02:07:46,005
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean because I've got like tons of them.

1670
02:07:46,505 --> 02:07:47,286
[SPEAKER_11]: They're overrunning my backyard.

1671
02:07:47,306 --> 02:07:49,769
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you going to do if somebody in New York is like, yes, I want a cat?

1672
02:07:49,869 --> 02:07:52,291
[SPEAKER_11]: I will put it in a box and ship it UPS.

1673
02:07:52,331 --> 02:07:53,152
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, just kidding.

1674
02:07:53,513 --> 02:07:55,074
[SPEAKER_11]: I will not do that because that's cruel.

1675
02:07:55,935 --> 02:07:57,677
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll ship it FedEx.

1676
02:07:58,898 --> 02:08:02,422
[SPEAKER_11]: Obviously, I can't get you a cat unless you actually drive all the way out here.

1677
02:08:02,742 --> 02:08:04,983
[SPEAKER_03]: Heart8 in our chatroom suggests a cat Snuggie.

1678
02:08:05,303 --> 02:08:05,984
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that idea.

1679
02:08:06,024 --> 02:08:09,305
[SPEAKER_11]: But, unfortunately, you will have to come and... It's kind of like pick and pull.

1680
02:08:09,466 --> 02:08:11,867
[SPEAKER_11]: You will have to pick and pull your own cat out of the backyard.

1681
02:08:14,588 --> 02:08:16,089
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't provide that service for you.

1682
02:08:16,569 --> 02:08:22,672
[SPEAKER_11]: There's only one cat that will actually... There's one of the cats that will actually get very paralyzed with fear.

1683
02:08:22,892 --> 02:08:24,933
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's the only cat that I can actually pick up out there.

1684
02:08:25,654 --> 02:08:27,795
[SPEAKER_11]: Because it'll just kind of freeze up and I just...

1685
02:08:28,496 --> 02:08:28,696
[SPEAKER_11]: Scoop.

1686
02:08:28,896 --> 02:08:29,437
[SPEAKER_03]: Scoop it right up.

1687
02:08:46,918 --> 02:08:50,800
[SPEAKER_03]: Alan showed me a video this week that makes me want a dog.

1688
02:08:51,060 --> 02:08:51,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, seriously.

1689
02:08:51,800 --> 02:08:54,821
[SPEAKER_03]: Because this is the cutest dog I've ever seen in my life.

1690
02:08:54,841 --> 02:08:55,522
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay?

1691
02:08:55,742 --> 02:08:57,002
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know what type of dog it is?

1692
02:08:57,503 --> 02:08:58,263
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a corgi.

1693
02:08:58,683 --> 02:08:59,563
[SPEAKER_03]: I love corgis!

1694
02:09:00,344 --> 02:09:03,885
[SPEAKER_03]: And the video, if you want to look this up on YouTube, is called Corgi Flop.

1695
02:09:04,526 --> 02:09:07,267
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's the most adorable thing I've ever seen in my entire life.

1696
02:09:07,327 --> 02:09:09,048
[SPEAKER_03]: So, like, there's this little dog that goes in.

1697
02:09:09,348 --> 02:09:10,288
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they got... Oh, wait, wait, wait.

1698
02:09:10,388 --> 02:09:11,429
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, where's the corgi?

1699
02:09:11,449 --> 02:09:11,669
[SPEAKER_03]: Corgi!

1700
02:09:11,689 --> 02:09:13,209
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so the dog and the person jump in.

1701
02:09:13,610 --> 02:09:14,450
[SPEAKER_03]: There goes the corgi.

1702
02:09:14,470 --> 02:09:14,570
[SPEAKER_03]: Corgi.

1703
02:09:15,111 --> 02:09:16,234
[SPEAKER_10]: Hold on.

1704
02:09:16,695 --> 02:09:22,730
[SPEAKER_03]: The corgi, like, watches for a minute, and then the corgi just, at some point, the corgi goes, come on, come on, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it.

1705
02:09:25,489 --> 02:09:26,970
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

1706
02:09:50,143 --> 02:09:52,983
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me link that in our chat room there, because I apologize.

1707
02:09:53,004 --> 02:09:56,824
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes for terrible radio, but I had to derail the show and just tell you about my experience.

1708
02:09:57,764 --> 02:09:58,404
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a big deal.

1709
02:09:58,464 --> 02:10:00,905
[SPEAKER_03]: For me to say I want a dog is a huge deal.

1710
02:10:00,965 --> 02:10:02,305
[SPEAKER_03]: Ask somebody who's known me for years and years.

1711
02:10:02,625 --> 02:10:07,986
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, me saying I want a dog, that's like call hell and ask if they've got ice cream.

1712
02:10:08,506 --> 02:10:11,507
[SPEAKER_03]: Really, yeah.

1713
02:10:11,587 --> 02:10:15,287
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like going into Rob's bedroom and finding an AK under his bed.

1714
02:10:16,628 --> 02:10:17,068
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty much.

1715
02:10:17,528 --> 02:10:19,308
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, anyhow, let's move on.

1716
02:10:20,469 --> 02:10:21,090
[SPEAKER_03]: 8-Hour-a-Week Limit

1717
02:10:38,368 --> 02:10:39,709
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, that's right.

1718
02:10:40,210 --> 02:10:50,499
[SPEAKER_03]: What's happening is that apparently in Final Fantasy XIV, once you've played a particular job class for 8 hours, the amount of experience you start to earn decreases.

1719
02:10:51,040 --> 02:10:54,103
[SPEAKER_03]: And once you've played for 15 hours, you're done.

1720
02:10:54,623 --> 02:10:56,625
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't earn any more experience.

1721
02:10:57,285 --> 02:11:00,428
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the reverse of what other games like World of Warcraft do.

1722
02:11:00,448 --> 02:11:01,709
[SPEAKER_11]: Wait, is it just one job class?

1723
02:11:01,749 --> 02:11:03,351
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you switch classes to something else?

1724
02:11:03,471 --> 02:11:04,832
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, apparently you can.

1725
02:11:04,852 --> 02:11:09,456
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's like, you know, if you remember Final Fantasy XI, that's practically like doing a whole different character.

1726
02:11:09,816 --> 02:11:10,496
[SPEAKER_03]: Completely different.

1727
02:11:10,777 --> 02:11:12,999
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a quote real quick about why this system is in place.

1728
02:11:13,359 --> 02:11:13,599
[SPEAKER_03]: Quote,

1729
02:11:21,986 --> 02:11:27,910
[SPEAKER_03]: Furthermore, it is being designed to not give those with more time on their hands to play an unfair advantage.

1730
02:11:33,840 --> 02:11:34,981
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1731
02:11:53,838 --> 02:11:55,959
[SPEAKER_03]: Just up in arms about this.

1732
02:11:56,039 --> 02:11:57,961
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, on the website going crazy.

1733
02:11:58,021 --> 02:11:59,982
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you guys have got to be kidding me.

1734
02:12:00,283 --> 02:12:02,665
[SPEAKER_03]: Who are you to tell me how long I can be playing these games?

1735
02:12:03,926 --> 02:12:04,606
[SPEAKER_03]: It's my money.

1736
02:12:05,006 --> 02:12:13,213
[SPEAKER_09]: There's another thing, though, to consider is that if it's also on a per-character basis, it also sort of balances out the leveling.

1737
02:12:14,374 --> 02:12:17,616
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, what's the word I'm thinking of?

1738
02:12:17,676 --> 02:12:19,098
[SPEAKER_09]: The hierarchy of levels?

1739
02:12:19,118 --> 02:12:19,638
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1740
02:12:19,818 --> 02:12:24,080
[SPEAKER_09]: to where you're not going to have a week later maxed out characters.

1741
02:12:24,800 --> 02:12:40,227
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to have people to really follow the incentive that are going to be on a more even par so people move up together and then they can start putting out content later on for those people who hit those higher levels.

1742
02:12:40,447 --> 02:12:41,048
[SPEAKER_09]: Does that make sense?

1743
02:12:42,128 --> 02:12:42,568
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit.

1744
02:12:43,069 --> 02:12:48,391
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, there was a translation that came out on the North American website that helped her try to bring some clarity to this.

1745
02:12:48,811 --> 02:12:49,872
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very lengthy.

1746
02:12:50,352 --> 02:12:51,753
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me try to give you the bullet points here.

1747
02:12:52,473 --> 02:12:57,075
[SPEAKER_03]: We calculated a value for the amount of skill or experience points that could be earned in a one-hour period.

1748
02:12:57,375 --> 02:13:09,301
[SPEAKER_03]: This theoretical value represents an hour spent engaged solely in combat, left quests, or any other activities that earn skill or experience points and sets a threshold to delimiting how many of these points can be earned in a period of play.

1749
02:13:09,861 --> 02:13:36,153
[SPEAKER_03]: based on this we have implemented a threshold value concept these thresholds are regulated by a one week timer that begins counting down the instant you earn experience points after a week has passed the thresholds will reset and the moment skill experience points are earned again the timer begins counting down anew for the first eight thresholds during this week long period players will receive skill or experience points at the maximum rate and then it goes on after that and then eventually reaches a rate of zero

1750
02:13:36,673 --> 02:13:44,695
[SPEAKER_03]: It is worth noting, however, that the reduced rate will also gradually recover while players are engaged in activities that do not yield skill or experience points.

1751
02:13:45,096 --> 02:13:50,917
[SPEAKER_03]: In this manner, it is possible for the threshold value to reset completely even before the completion of the one-week timer.

1752
02:13:52,418 --> 02:14:02,781
[SPEAKER_03]: So in a nutshell, this is very convoluted, but those of you that just plan to take three days off work and play Final Fantasy XIV non-stop when this comes out are going to be hitting this wall.

1753
02:14:03,154 --> 02:14:18,936
[SPEAKER_11]: yeah but now they're talking about stuff that doesn't require skills so say for example I go and fight fight fight fight fight and then burn out the whole thing then I can go craft and that will kind of build it back I mean I could spend a bunch of time like making food or something I don't know

1754
02:14:21,221 --> 02:14:22,061
[SPEAKER_03]: It's interesting.

1755
02:14:22,121 --> 02:14:23,002
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's their game.

1756
02:14:23,022 --> 02:14:24,782
[SPEAKER_03]: They can do what they want, but let me go back.

1757
02:14:25,283 --> 02:14:27,003
[SPEAKER_03]: I've played the Final Fantasy XIV beta.

1758
02:14:27,163 --> 02:14:29,164
[SPEAKER_03]: It stinks, and I'm sorry.

1759
02:14:29,304 --> 02:14:31,465
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think they made a quick game at all.

1760
02:14:33,146 --> 02:14:35,447
[SPEAKER_03]: It's harder, at least in the beta I played.

1761
02:14:36,107 --> 02:14:38,428
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, it's been a couple months, or maybe a month.

1762
02:14:39,028 --> 02:14:40,049
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1763
02:15:00,387 --> 02:15:12,887
[SPEAKER_03]: for me, that's where the weirdness is of this is that they swear up and down they want to make this more casual MMO and something you don't have to spend all this time playing but it just seems like the game itself is still Final Fantasy XI upgraded you know what I mean?

1764
02:15:13,688 --> 02:15:14,229
[SPEAKER_03]: so, I don't know

1765
02:15:16,109 --> 02:15:16,649
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be weird.

1766
02:15:17,250 --> 02:15:19,972
[SPEAKER_03]: Bonds in our chatroom says, good thing Warcraft does not do that.

1767
02:15:20,232 --> 02:15:23,034
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if you think about it, though, they do, in a way.

1768
02:15:23,294 --> 02:15:24,375
[SPEAKER_03]: They just do the reverse.

1769
02:15:24,995 --> 02:15:31,020
[SPEAKER_03]: You get rewarded with double XP for the time you aren't playing and logged out consecutively on a character.

1770
02:15:31,440 --> 02:15:34,122
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's to help you catch up so that people can't get too far ahead.

1771
02:15:34,582 --> 02:15:37,384
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's just like, it's more of a reward than a penalty.

1772
02:15:37,424 --> 02:15:40,166
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that seems to be where a lot of people are up in arms.

1773
02:15:40,786 --> 02:15:40,907
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

1774
02:15:41,927 --> 02:15:44,308
[SPEAKER_03]: Ziba in our chatroom says Guild Wars 2 all the way.

1775
02:15:44,628 --> 02:15:49,129
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I saw a video of Guild Wars 2 gameplay and I gotta say it looks pretty hot.

1776
02:15:49,509 --> 02:15:51,210
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks very action oriented.

1777
02:15:51,250 --> 02:15:53,810
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me see if I can find that same video here.

1778
02:15:54,130 --> 02:15:55,131
[SPEAKER_03]: Another quick YouTube.

1779
02:15:56,411 --> 02:15:59,612
[SPEAKER_03]: Have either of you guys heard anything about Guild Wars 2 or seen any of this?

1780
02:16:00,732 --> 02:16:00,972
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope.

1781
02:16:01,652 --> 02:16:04,633
[SPEAKER_09]: I kind of got out of the Guild Wars thing.

1782
02:16:04,653 --> 02:16:05,674
[SPEAKER_03]: This is so different.

1783
02:16:06,074 --> 02:16:06,534
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, here it is.

1784
02:16:06,654 --> 02:16:09,915
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is out of Gamescom.

1785
02:16:09,955 --> 02:16:10,895
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there we go.

1786
02:16:13,143 --> 02:16:13,423
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura

1787
02:16:39,540 --> 02:16:46,103
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, in other stuff, we do have... Now, this is not just gaming related.

1788
02:16:46,163 --> 02:16:54,567
[SPEAKER_09]: This is archaeology and anthropology and prehistoric biology.

1789
02:16:55,567 --> 02:16:56,788
[SPEAKER_03]: So, like Indiana Jones?

1790
02:16:58,934 --> 02:17:00,054
[SPEAKER_03]: Laura Croft, Tomb Raider

1791
02:17:19,663 --> 02:17:28,451
[SPEAKER_09]: They found a type of turtle, a Maolinid, I believe is how it's said, that evolved 50 million years ago.

1792
02:17:30,092 --> 02:17:36,819
[SPEAKER_09]: But now the funny thing about it is that when you look at it face on, it looks like King Koopa.

1793
02:17:38,377 --> 02:17:43,378
[SPEAKER_09]: Seriously, it's got the same facial shape.

1794
02:17:44,979 --> 02:17:48,779
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm not saying the old school Koopa, I'm saying the modern incarnation.

1795
02:17:50,280 --> 02:17:52,620
[SPEAKER_09]: It's got that flat head and the horns.

1796
02:17:52,640 --> 02:17:53,380
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you talking about?

1797
02:17:53,400 --> 02:17:54,981
[SPEAKER_03]: That thing looks nothing like Dennis Hopper.

1798
02:17:56,441 --> 02:17:56,761
[SPEAKER_03]: Get it?

1799
02:17:57,081 --> 02:17:58,321
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I get it.

1800
02:17:59,282 --> 02:18:01,702
[SPEAKER_11]: I know it's too soon, but they're both dead!

1801
02:18:01,722 --> 02:18:02,242
[SPEAKER_11]: Wah wah.

1802
02:18:05,283 --> 02:18:08,946
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to actually link the story into the chatroom because this is actually pretty cool.

1803
02:18:09,286 --> 02:18:11,167
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to see what our chatroom thinks about this.

1804
02:18:11,307 --> 02:18:12,308
[SPEAKER_09]: A quick wire in.

1805
02:18:12,588 --> 02:18:13,369
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what it looks like?

1806
02:18:13,469 --> 02:18:16,190
[SPEAKER_11]: It looks like, oh God, what the hell is his name?

1807
02:18:16,451 --> 02:18:17,651
[SPEAKER_11]: It looks fat is what it looks like.

1808
02:18:17,791 --> 02:18:21,034
[SPEAKER_11]: The big old turtle from Final Fantasy?

1809
02:18:21,054 --> 02:18:23,195
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I know what you're talking about.

1810
02:18:23,215 --> 02:18:23,655
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, yes.

1811
02:18:23,796 --> 02:18:24,696
[SPEAKER_03]: I know exactly what you're talking about.

1812
02:18:24,716 --> 02:18:25,397
[SPEAKER_03]: I forget the name too.

1813
02:18:26,838 --> 02:18:29,960
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, here's the question that's burning on my mind, DarkSakura.

1814
02:18:30,020 --> 02:18:33,302
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it a Koopa Troopa or a Para Koopa Troopa?

1815
02:18:33,462 --> 02:18:34,303
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a King Koopa.

1816
02:18:34,503 --> 02:18:34,863
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I see.

1817
02:18:35,863 --> 02:18:36,984
[SPEAKER_09]: Seriously, look at that head.

1818
02:18:38,004 --> 02:18:39,145
[SPEAKER_09]: That's an ugly sumbitch.

1819
02:18:40,845 --> 02:18:44,667
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, maybe it's... And Ranma in chat says, Zach, it's my ex-girlfriend.

1820
02:18:46,348 --> 02:18:47,488
[SPEAKER_11]: You dated a turtle?

1821
02:18:47,968 --> 02:18:48,889
[SPEAKER_11]: God, you're dumb.

1822
02:18:53,298 --> 02:18:54,539
[SPEAKER_09]: I like following all the links on here.

1823
02:18:54,559 --> 02:18:56,381
[SPEAKER_11]: What kind of weird kinky shit are you into?

1824
02:18:56,461 --> 02:19:02,386
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it possible that Miyamoto just got inspiration from books on the Galapagos Islands or something?

1825
02:19:03,187 --> 02:19:04,068
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be.

1826
02:19:04,108 --> 02:19:06,349
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we're reading way too much into this.

1827
02:19:06,450 --> 02:19:07,110
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I think you're right.

1828
02:19:07,130 --> 02:19:12,495
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, after all, it's the turtle that decided to evolve into something that would become a video game.

1829
02:19:12,575 --> 02:19:13,195
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why.

1830
02:19:13,335 --> 02:19:16,958
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we are thinking way too hard on this, and Loki, I demand a story about porn.

1831
02:19:17,739 --> 02:19:18,279
[SPEAKER_03]: Help me out here.

1832
02:19:18,739 --> 02:19:19,740
[SPEAKER_11]: A story about porn.

1833
02:19:20,100 --> 02:19:20,980
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you know what?

1834
02:19:21,160 --> 02:19:34,204
[SPEAKER_11]: I think I can kind of help you out because Playboy is teaming up with Big Point to form a new game label because they had some really awesome games that came out way back in the day, I guess.

1835
02:19:34,405 --> 02:19:38,506
[SPEAKER_03]: Now this isn't about porn because you know you only subscribe to Playboy for the articles.

1836
02:19:42,891 --> 02:19:53,496
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, anyways, they're teaming up with Big Point, uh, which is currently working on, I guess, the Battlestar Galactica online game, not having to do with porn, and, uh, other free, uh, to play games on its own web portal.

1837
02:19:53,716 --> 02:19:58,818
[SPEAKER_11]: And it says, uh, Playboy will now also distribute, uh, through its own domain some, uh, free-to-play games.

1838
02:19:59,399 --> 02:20:03,200
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, the first game to get the Red Cartman treatment is Poisonville.

1839
02:20:03,901 --> 02:20:06,362
[SPEAKER_11]: I wonder if this is like Farmville, but with poison.

1840
02:20:09,143 --> 02:20:10,784
[SPEAKER_11]: Link is probably not safe for work.

1841
02:20:10,924 --> 02:20:11,444
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's check it out.

1842
02:20:37,114 --> 02:20:39,876
[SPEAKER_11]: And the video's not playing, so I can only assume that there's no boobs.

1843
02:20:40,236 --> 02:20:42,358
[SPEAKER_11]: And I am very disappointed by that.

1844
02:20:43,939 --> 02:20:49,262
[SPEAKER_11]: Although I do have to say, though, in the background they have Pam Anderson from Miss February 1990.

1845
02:20:49,883 --> 02:20:51,324
[SPEAKER_11]: And she looks quite different now.

1846
02:20:54,184 --> 02:20:54,484
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

1847
02:21:20,940 --> 02:21:22,741
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, she's making out with some dude.

1848
02:21:23,041 --> 02:21:24,562
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, and she stole his car.

1849
02:21:27,724 --> 02:21:28,925
[SPEAKER_11]: Now that sounds like a game, Jamie.

1850
02:21:29,025 --> 02:21:32,587
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like they do a GTA game starring a badass chick.

1851
02:21:32,827 --> 02:21:33,967
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that's what it seems like so far.

1852
02:21:33,987 --> 02:21:35,188
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I'll play that.

1853
02:21:37,149 --> 02:21:40,451
[SPEAKER_11]: And she's going into the ghetto.

1854
02:21:40,791 --> 02:21:41,772
[SPEAKER_11]: There's all sorts of guys.

1855
02:21:41,972 --> 02:21:45,934
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a guy that just did a roundhouse kick into a windshield and broke the windshield.

1856
02:21:46,454 --> 02:21:47,555
[SPEAKER_11]: That's really excessive.

1857
02:21:49,096 --> 02:22:09,515
[SPEAKER_11]: and now she's teaming up with some really weird looking bikers it's a bunch of like really kind of girl powered chicks with assault rifles so if you imagine like a Saints Row why is Playboy making this girl Saints Row or APB with like you know lots of chicks and ski masks look look I don't mean to sound like sexist or whatever but why is Playboy

1858
02:22:10,356 --> 02:22:12,458
[SPEAKER_03]: The home of women exploitation.

1859
02:22:12,978 --> 02:22:17,582
[SPEAKER_03]: Making this game that's now like, hey, the girl's in charge.

1860
02:22:17,702 --> 02:22:18,943
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Angelina Jolie.

1861
02:22:19,003 --> 02:22:21,525
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm making out and stealing cars and all this stuff.

1862
02:22:21,585 --> 02:22:23,247
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I don't get it.

1863
02:22:23,967 --> 02:22:24,788
[SPEAKER_11]: It looks neat.

1864
02:22:24,908 --> 02:22:29,152
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, if it's free to play, I might check it out because, you know, it's kind of cool looking.

1865
02:22:29,772 --> 02:22:33,855
[SPEAKER_11]: But that's the trailer, which I'm sure has nothing to do with the actual gameplay of the game.

1866
02:22:34,816 --> 02:22:39,240
[SPEAKER_11]: And I gotta say, with a game that's, you know, on Playboy.com, um...

1867
02:22:40,874 --> 02:22:41,315
[SPEAKER_11]: Poisonville.com

1868
02:22:55,774 --> 02:23:01,276
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, Toa Gak in our chatroom says, GTA, girl take all your shit, in parentheses.

1869
02:23:01,336 --> 02:23:02,456
[SPEAKER_03]: Nah, he's trying, he's trying.

1870
02:23:02,616 --> 02:23:03,817
[SPEAKER_03]: You need a better acronym than that.

1871
02:23:03,937 --> 02:23:05,897
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, they've got the beta.

1872
02:23:06,157 --> 02:23:08,778
[SPEAKER_11]: You can try this free to play right now.

1873
02:23:09,379 --> 02:23:10,739
[SPEAKER_11]: Someone sounds like an infomercial.

1874
02:23:10,759 --> 02:23:11,859
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you on Playboy's payroll?

1875
02:23:12,019 --> 02:23:12,520
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I'm on...

1876
02:23:13,820 --> 02:23:15,521
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm on the Poisonville website.

1877
02:23:15,582 --> 02:23:20,205
[SPEAKER_11]: But I gotta say, though, I'm looking at all these different screenshots.

1878
02:23:20,225 --> 02:23:23,748
[SPEAKER_11]: The screenshots look pretty good, but the game has no nudity.

1879
02:23:24,309 --> 02:23:27,811
[SPEAKER_11]: Therefore, it does not need to be on this website.

1880
02:23:27,891 --> 02:23:37,099
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, if it's Playboy Mansion, the game, you know, where it's like, you know, kind of an adult version of Charlie's Angels where Hef is Charlie.

1881
02:23:40,061 --> 02:23:42,263
[SPEAKER_03]: The girls next door of the game would be great.

1882
02:23:42,745 --> 02:23:43,766
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello, angels.

1883
02:23:44,026 --> 02:23:45,686
[SPEAKER_11]: I need you to pleasure me today.

1884
02:23:46,907 --> 02:23:48,488
[SPEAKER_11]: That's how I kind of picture that game.

1885
02:23:48,988 --> 02:23:51,089
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want a decent game with boobies.

1886
02:23:51,189 --> 02:23:52,250
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that too much to ask?

1887
02:23:53,470 --> 02:23:54,451
[SPEAKER_03]: Besides God of War.

1888
02:23:55,591 --> 02:23:55,831
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1889
02:23:56,392 --> 02:23:56,912
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on.

1890
02:23:57,552 --> 02:23:58,293
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about...

1891
02:23:59,235 --> 02:23:59,956
[SPEAKER_03]: Atari 2600 Sword Quest, Tempest,

1892
02:24:22,672 --> 02:24:29,995
[SPEAKER_03]: Outlaw, Dodgem, Real Sports Football, Starship, and basically all the same shit you see in Game Room, right?

1893
02:24:30,015 --> 02:24:35,157
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's some arcade hits, including Pong and Lunar Lander and Missile Command and all this.

1894
02:24:35,838 --> 02:24:41,560
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess the one neat thing about this game, it is a $30 cartridge, so you're kind of like, oh boy, what do I care?

1895
02:24:41,920 --> 02:24:45,042
[SPEAKER_03]: The one neat thing about this game is that it does have something Game Room doesn't have.

1896
02:24:45,482 --> 02:24:48,063
[SPEAKER_03]: Single cartridge multiplayer games.

1897
02:24:48,183 --> 02:24:49,143
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

1898
02:25:10,573 --> 02:25:11,113
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1899
02:25:12,073 --> 02:25:18,695
[SPEAKER_03]: We got our retro fix with Game Room, and if they would just add multiplayer, maybe it would be better, and so on and so forth.

1900
02:25:19,215 --> 02:25:19,715
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

1901
02:25:21,515 --> 02:25:22,716
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, how about the mailbag?

1902
02:25:22,816 --> 02:25:34,898
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go to our mailbag at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com Every week, DarkSakura dives into the mailbag head first, picks out a couple emails that she thinks are worthy of being read on the show, and then she reads them.

1903
02:25:35,978 --> 02:25:36,519
[SPEAKER_03]: I do.

1904
02:25:36,699 --> 02:25:37,199
[SPEAKER_03]: You do.

1905
02:25:38,039 --> 02:25:38,699
[SPEAKER_03]: So, DarkSakura.

1906
02:25:39,594 --> 02:25:43,497
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, first of all, I delete any email that's full of stupidity.

1907
02:25:44,258 --> 02:25:44,898
[SPEAKER_09]: Good for you!

1908
02:25:46,119 --> 02:25:51,543
[SPEAKER_09]: So let me go on to the first of our beautiful, gorgeous, fantastical emails.

1909
02:25:53,164 --> 02:25:53,985
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll start with a shorty.

1910
02:25:55,066 --> 02:25:56,087
[SPEAKER_09]: Greetings, OLR crew.

1911
02:25:56,127 --> 02:25:57,207
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been a while, hasn't it?

1912
02:25:57,948 --> 02:25:59,409
[SPEAKER_09]: Just want to say that I love the show.

1913
02:25:59,589 --> 02:26:02,772
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, I saw Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, and it's now my new favorite movie.

1914
02:26:03,152 --> 02:26:05,354
[SPEAKER_09]: The video game references are hilarious.

1915
02:26:05,994 --> 02:26:09,395
[SPEAKER_09]: The Gay Roommate is hilarious, and so are the seven evil exes.

1916
02:26:09,875 --> 02:26:13,656
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to buy the book so I can see the backstory, and I'm going to buy the game also.

1917
02:26:14,096 --> 02:26:15,456
[SPEAKER_09]: So keep up the good work, OLR.

1918
02:26:15,656 --> 02:26:17,316
[SPEAKER_09]: Love, Geekboy2424.

1919
02:26:17,516 --> 02:26:17,836
[SPEAKER_09]: P.S.

1920
02:26:18,297 --> 02:26:23,278
[SPEAKER_09]: Those of you who get the reference from K-On, I give OLR a moi moi heart cannon.

1921
02:26:24,638 --> 02:26:24,998
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

1922
02:26:26,818 --> 02:26:27,318
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thanks.

1923
02:26:27,578 --> 02:26:28,479
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad you liked the movie.

1924
02:26:28,519 --> 02:26:33,560
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't think it was the best movie ever, but it tickled the retro funny bone, I suppose.

1925
02:26:34,260 --> 02:26:35,000
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, all that stuff.

1926
02:26:36,411 --> 02:26:36,771
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

1927
02:26:37,991 --> 02:26:38,912
[SPEAKER_09]: Next one from Troy.

1928
02:26:39,312 --> 02:26:39,772
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi.

1929
02:26:40,652 --> 02:26:44,913
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, apparently he sent two, so I'm going to actually go to the, see if I can find the first one.

1930
02:26:45,913 --> 02:26:46,733
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, maybe not.

1931
02:26:47,413 --> 02:26:48,514
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll just go ahead and read this one.

1932
02:26:50,174 --> 02:26:53,555
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry for the double email, but I thought this was funny.

1933
02:26:53,595 --> 02:26:57,856
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently you can buy Halo Reach early for 99,999 Microsoft points.

1934
02:27:00,662 --> 02:27:03,143
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, somebody didn't listen to last week's show yet when they sent the email.

1935
02:27:03,743 --> 02:27:04,103
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1936
02:27:04,143 --> 02:27:05,864
[SPEAKER_03]: Talked all about it on last week's show.

1937
02:27:05,964 --> 02:27:07,304
[SPEAKER_03]: And no, you can't.

1938
02:27:08,545 --> 02:27:09,685
[SPEAKER_03]: It's much cheaper than that now.

1939
02:27:10,726 --> 02:27:10,966
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it?

1940
02:27:11,506 --> 02:27:12,326
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, free.

1941
02:27:14,567 --> 02:27:15,347
[SPEAKER_03]: True, true.

1942
02:27:16,067 --> 02:27:18,928
[SPEAKER_03]: But you might get banned according to an article earlier in the show.

1943
02:27:19,349 --> 02:27:20,189
[SPEAKER_09]: This one's for me.

1944
02:27:21,348 --> 02:27:28,055
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey OLR, I'm writing in with a food-related question.

1945
02:27:28,115 --> 02:27:29,616
[SPEAKER_09]: It's labeled Orange Lounge Foodio.

1946
02:27:30,737 --> 02:27:33,960
[SPEAKER_09]: Food-related question specifically for Jamie.

1947
02:27:34,321 --> 02:27:38,024
[SPEAKER_09]: Apologies for sending this to the show inbox, but I couldn't find a way of contacting her personally.

1948
02:27:38,144 --> 02:27:38,485
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

1949
02:27:39,305 --> 02:27:42,188
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'll go ahead and read it.

1950
02:27:42,208 --> 02:27:43,950
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't had a good food derailing yet.

1951
02:27:44,562 --> 02:27:45,082
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

1952
02:28:07,020 --> 02:28:09,542
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been including foods such as salmon, beef, and oats into my diet.

1953
02:28:09,722 --> 02:28:12,263
[SPEAKER_09]: Anything with healthy fats and proteins will be appreciated as well.

1954
02:28:12,884 --> 02:28:13,944
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much in advance.

1955
02:28:13,964 --> 02:28:15,405
[SPEAKER_09]: I love the show and keep up the good work.

1956
02:28:15,465 --> 02:28:19,448
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not going to read the person's name, but I'm sure the person knows who it is.

1957
02:28:19,868 --> 02:28:22,490
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you're going to want to eat fried chicken and pizza.

1958
02:28:22,510 --> 02:28:22,810
[SPEAKER_03]: No, Rob.

1959
02:28:23,350 --> 02:28:25,172
[SPEAKER_09]: It's gaining... That's how I gain weight.

1960
02:28:25,232 --> 02:28:29,094
[SPEAKER_09]: The way that my uncle did it is he ate a lot of tuna.

1961
02:28:29,274 --> 02:28:31,616
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of tuna.

1962
02:28:33,457 --> 02:28:34,297
[SPEAKER_09]: You can also...

1963
02:28:36,672 --> 02:28:43,359
[SPEAKER_09]: Keep in mind, I'm going more towards the opposite direction, towards the lean tissue, the losing side.

1964
02:28:44,740 --> 02:28:50,185
[SPEAKER_09]: But you can eat... Tempeh is really good to get your protein from if you want a vegetarian source.

1965
02:28:52,427 --> 02:28:55,730
[SPEAKER_09]: Tofu... Beefcake 3000.

1966
02:28:57,557 --> 02:28:58,298
[SPEAKER_03]: Beefcake!

1967
02:28:59,239 --> 02:29:08,470
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're trying to go the real food route, I know that the way that my uncle did it is that also instead of sucrose, he used fructose as his sweetener because it's a more complex sugar.

1968
02:29:09,271 --> 02:29:13,316
[SPEAKER_09]: More whole wheat type stuff, but I'd say lots of fish.

1969
02:29:13,796 --> 02:29:14,237
[SPEAKER_09]: Lots of fish.

1970
02:29:14,257 --> 02:29:14,818
[SPEAKER_09]: Go get sushi.

1971
02:29:14,838 --> 02:29:16,420
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of sashimi.

1972
02:29:17,200 --> 02:29:19,861
[SPEAKER_09]: and you know, I don't know if you've got a Fuddruckers where you are.

1973
02:29:20,301 --> 02:29:22,101
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't seen them out in that area but maybe they do.

1974
02:29:22,442 --> 02:29:24,162
[SPEAKER_09]: They have elk burgers and they're super good.

1975
02:29:24,182 --> 02:29:28,923
[SPEAKER_09]: You can get elk and game meat like you can get venison at some grocery stores.

1976
02:29:29,503 --> 02:29:30,504
[SPEAKER_09]: You can probably go hunting for it.

1977
02:29:31,004 --> 02:29:32,504
[SPEAKER_03]: I should put out this disclaimer.

1978
02:29:32,564 --> 02:29:34,705
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie's not a doctor and neither am I. I am not.

1979
02:29:35,145 --> 02:29:39,166
[SPEAKER_03]: And you really should, if you want to make sure you're doing it the right way, be under a doctor's care.

1980
02:29:39,426 --> 02:29:41,248
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I was going to say, Rob.

1981
02:29:41,288 --> 02:29:42,009
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just saying.

1982
02:29:42,289 --> 02:29:43,631
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say it.

1983
02:29:43,691 --> 02:29:44,652
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't want to get sued.

1984
02:29:45,453 --> 02:29:46,313
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not a doctor.

1985
02:29:46,914 --> 02:29:48,556
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm telling you what I've read.

1986
02:29:48,896 --> 02:29:50,077
[SPEAKER_03]: She plays one on the internet.

1987
02:29:52,080 --> 02:29:52,780
[SPEAKER_09]: Dr. Sakura.

1988
02:29:52,960 --> 02:29:53,101
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

1989
02:29:53,321 --> 02:29:54,682
[SPEAKER_03]: She's played a lot of Trauma Center.

1990
02:29:55,563 --> 02:29:55,904
[SPEAKER_09]: Shut up.

1991
02:29:57,826 --> 02:29:58,987
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't make me break out the Vuvuzela.

1992
02:30:01,084 --> 02:30:07,149
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, I'm really, I'm just passing on to you what I've observed, what I've seen other people do.

1993
02:30:07,449 --> 02:30:16,976
[SPEAKER_09]: Really the best thing to do, which is what I was getting to before Rob stood on the soapbox, is talk to your nutritionist.

1994
02:30:17,216 --> 02:30:18,117
[SPEAKER_09]: Find a nutritionist.

1995
02:30:18,857 --> 02:30:19,658
[SPEAKER_09]: Do some research.

1996
02:30:21,039 --> 02:30:24,221
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll email you back with some of my own happenings.

1997
02:30:25,542 --> 02:30:28,164
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll make sure that you get my contact information.

1998
02:30:28,785 --> 02:30:28,945
[SPEAKER_09]: But...

1999
02:30:30,339 --> 02:30:38,406
[SPEAKER_09]: but yeah, I mean, and of course make sure that you do not slack off on the exercise change your routine

2000
02:30:39,651 --> 02:30:41,952
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless your goal is to get a bigger butt.

2001
02:30:42,772 --> 02:30:54,417
[SPEAKER_09]: A trainer that I talked to just the other day actually said that if you start hitting a rut in your, like your, and I was kind of actually, I was thinking about this too because I used to do this with DDR.

2002
02:30:55,377 --> 02:30:55,577
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

2003
02:30:56,797 --> 02:31:05,961
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that if you feel something getting too easy and you know, you can change it up, do something that's harder because that's how you challenge yourself, right?

2004
02:31:05,981 --> 02:31:06,081
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

2005
02:31:06,621 --> 02:31:16,329
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, someone was bringing it up at the gym just the other day and I was hearing him talk about it and I guess the same thing would apply, you know.

2006
02:31:17,410 --> 02:31:19,552
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not a fitness coach.

2007
02:31:20,233 --> 02:31:24,036
[SPEAKER_03]: And if all you really want is a bigger butt, DarkSakura was looking at some stuff before the show.

2008
02:31:24,056 --> 02:31:25,357
[SPEAKER_09]: Booty pop panties.

2009
02:31:25,557 --> 02:31:26,598
[SPEAKER_03]: Just look them up.

2010
02:31:26,718 --> 02:31:27,879
[SPEAKER_09]: Booty pop panties.

2011
02:31:28,640 --> 02:31:30,241
[SPEAKER_09]: They're $20 panties.

2012
02:31:31,182 --> 02:31:32,043
[SPEAKER_03]: They give you a bigger butt.

2013
02:31:32,614 --> 02:31:35,756
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2014
02:31:57,069 --> 02:31:59,591
[SPEAKER_09]: Second, about the marathon show, I'd be up for it.

2015
02:31:59,671 --> 02:32:02,953
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't been able to listen live for a while because of school and working on my book.

2016
02:32:03,273 --> 02:32:05,674
[SPEAKER_09]: But the concept of a marathon show intrigues me.

2017
02:32:06,075 --> 02:32:09,697
[SPEAKER_09]: Just think of all the loopy, incoherent chatter we could deliver around 8 a.m.

2018
02:32:09,897 --> 02:32:12,198
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be like the old school DDR tournament shows.

2019
02:32:12,679 --> 02:32:14,420
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to hear some real train wreck radio...

2020
02:32:15,160 --> 02:32:16,981
[SPEAKER_03]: Go look at like the go try to find the show.

2021
02:32:17,001 --> 02:32:22,543
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even know if it was recorded at B3 where we did like we had to do like 20 hours of programming across two days.

2022
02:32:22,583 --> 02:32:23,223
[SPEAKER_03]: It was crazy.

2023
02:32:23,363 --> 02:32:26,865
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's or my favorite as well was the shaft that we did.

2024
02:32:27,425 --> 02:32:30,466
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it was called Sacramento hosts another fabulous tournament.

2025
02:32:31,586 --> 02:32:32,707
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that's what we said it was.

2026
02:32:32,927 --> 02:32:33,107
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

2027
02:32:33,707 --> 02:32:56,450
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, that's, that was hosted at Scandia, and I just remember, like, I was emceeing the, the DDR freestyle, and at certain points, I'd look over, and there was one point where it just looked like Loki was bambling, rambling incoherently into the microphone, like, I don't even know what he was saying, and then at one point, Jahi, God, I love that guy, I don't know where he, where he's at these days, but Jahi, like, I remember looking over, and he had the mic just by himself, and he was just doing, like, this, right?

2028
02:32:57,310 --> 02:33:03,033
[SPEAKER_03]: Like yelling into the microphone, it seemed like I'm like, who's listening to him right now?

2029
02:33:03,133 --> 02:33:03,894
[SPEAKER_03]: Poor people.

2030
02:33:04,374 --> 02:33:04,954
[SPEAKER_09]: I love Jahi.

2031
02:33:05,174 --> 02:33:06,075
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, good times.

2032
02:33:06,735 --> 02:33:11,057
[SPEAKER_09]: By the way, just a note for anyone who owns an iPad, buy a Bluetooth wireless keyboard.

2033
02:33:11,738 --> 02:33:19,622
[SPEAKER_09]: It is a better keyboard than the virtual keyboard on the iPad, doesn't move out of place like the keyboard that hooks into the iPad dock, and can be found online for 40 bucks.

2034
02:33:19,762 --> 02:33:20,842
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, I own an iPad.

2035
02:33:22,663 --> 02:33:24,925
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the face he made, the P. So it...

2036
02:33:26,065 --> 02:33:27,265
[SPEAKER_09]: Staycare Redertainment.

2037
02:33:27,786 --> 02:33:30,866
[SPEAKER_09]: This message has been brought to you by the Black Robin Christmas Carol.

2038
02:33:31,047 --> 02:33:32,587
[SPEAKER_09]: Insert self-indulgent plug here.

2039
02:33:32,927 --> 02:33:33,787
[SPEAKER_09]: Sent from my iPad.

2040
02:33:33,867 --> 02:33:34,167
[SPEAKER_09]: Ha!

2041
02:33:35,968 --> 02:33:36,848
[SPEAKER_09]: Last email, Rob?

2042
02:33:37,548 --> 02:33:38,429
[SPEAKER_09]: No, actually we got two.

2043
02:33:39,189 --> 02:33:40,429
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, here's the other part from Troy.

2044
02:33:40,489 --> 02:33:40,769
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

2045
02:33:41,189 --> 02:33:42,050
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey there, OLR.

2046
02:33:42,210 --> 02:33:46,771
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't entirely know if you guys know how to love a cat or even if you have a pet, but you should watch this.

2047
02:33:49,136 --> 02:33:51,157
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, it's 100 Ways to Love a Cat.

2048
02:33:52,578 --> 02:33:53,179
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll watch it later.

2049
02:33:53,199 --> 02:33:54,279
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll watch it later.

2050
02:33:54,379 --> 02:33:54,900
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a cat.

2051
02:33:54,980 --> 02:33:55,600
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a Shermie.

2052
02:33:56,260 --> 02:33:57,481
[SPEAKER_09]: She likes to be loved with food.

2053
02:34:01,584 --> 02:34:02,664
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, here's the last one.

2054
02:34:02,805 --> 02:34:03,785
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, OLR folks.

2055
02:34:04,325 --> 02:34:04,626
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

2056
02:34:06,387 --> 02:34:06,687
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob.

2057
02:34:06,987 --> 02:34:07,147
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

2058
02:34:07,187 --> 02:34:08,228
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to respond back.

2059
02:34:08,248 --> 02:34:09,629
[SPEAKER_03]: If they say hi, I've got to say hi back.

2060
02:34:09,669 --> 02:34:10,389
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to be rude.

2061
02:34:10,609 --> 02:34:11,510
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, OLR folks.

2062
02:34:11,550 --> 02:34:14,232
[SPEAKER_09]: There was something that a friend of mine said to me that really bothered me.

2063
02:34:14,612 --> 02:34:16,033
[SPEAKER_09]: He said I wasn't a hardcore gamer.

2064
02:34:16,573 --> 02:34:19,254
[SPEAKER_09]: I was quite hurt by that because I always thought I was a hardcore gamer.

2065
02:34:19,274 --> 02:34:22,795
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a PS3, Wii, DS, First Generation, Dreamcast, Game Boy Color, and N64.

2066
02:34:23,175 --> 02:34:23,735
[SPEAKER_09]: I still win.

2067
02:34:24,315 --> 02:34:25,975
[SPEAKER_09]: All with their original boxes.

2068
02:34:26,635 --> 02:34:37,678
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got figurines from Soul Calibur 2, a resin statue from Space Channel 5, mounds and mounds of video games, sheet music, a few video game reference t-shirts, and even my screensaver and desktop wallpapers are from Echo Chrome and I don't even owe the game.

2069
02:34:38,178 --> 02:34:39,619
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you think I'm still a hardcore gamer?

2070
02:34:40,619 --> 02:34:40,699
[SPEAKER_09]: Um...

2071
02:34:42,333 --> 02:34:43,993
[SPEAKER_09]: Game is what you play, not what you own

2072
02:35:03,058 --> 02:35:04,419
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2073
02:35:24,915 --> 02:35:44,161
[SPEAKER_09]: my friend is constantly trying to get me to play Left 4 Dead and even though I don't have an Xbox 360 nor do I want one the reason I don't want to play it is because I suck at first person shooters and I end up getting killed when I try to fight against more seasoned gamers except for Portal see, your friend's a hater I can't wait for the sequel to come out for the record, sequel is spelled S-E-Q-U-E-L not A-L

2074
02:35:44,901 --> 02:35:47,703
[SPEAKER_09]: For the past few years, FPSers have been all the rage.

2075
02:35:48,164 --> 02:35:49,885
[SPEAKER_09]: There have been Halo clones left and right.

2076
02:35:49,945 --> 02:35:57,991
[SPEAKER_09]: So I guess my question is, does not liking a certain genre that seems to currently be the most popular make you someone less of a gamer?

2077
02:35:58,371 --> 02:35:59,832
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for reading my email, Stan.

2078
02:36:00,773 --> 02:36:01,453
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it doesn't.

2079
02:36:02,174 --> 02:36:04,916
[SPEAKER_09]: Your friend is just being a dick.

2080
02:36:05,336 --> 02:36:07,156
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, can I play devil's advocate for a minute?

2081
02:36:07,536 --> 02:36:14,978
[SPEAKER_03]: I think everybody in chat is in agreeance that his friend's just being a jerk and a hater, and I think we're all saying that too, but let me ask you this.

2082
02:36:15,938 --> 02:36:29,260
[SPEAKER_03]: Using this same logic, is somebody that plays Facebook games and Farmville and Bejeweled Blitz and Imagine Cat Shop and Just Dance, are they a gamer?

2083
02:36:30,920 --> 02:36:32,201
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think Facebook games count.

2084
02:36:33,661 --> 02:36:33,961
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

2085
02:36:33,981 --> 02:36:34,101
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

2086
02:36:34,545 --> 02:36:39,207
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, if you're playing Bejeweled on a handheld system, that's a game.

2087
02:36:41,027 --> 02:36:43,868
[SPEAKER_09]: See, okay, well, here's the definition.

2088
02:36:43,928 --> 02:36:45,749
[SPEAKER_09]: You've got your casual games, right?

2089
02:36:46,909 --> 02:36:50,411
[SPEAKER_09]: Which, they're technically, yes, they're games.

2090
02:36:51,871 --> 02:37:01,514
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think that the actual definition of gamer as far as what is socially considered a gamer has to do specifically with PC and console games.

2091
02:37:02,455 --> 02:37:02,735
[SPEAKER_09]: Not

2092
02:37:04,635 --> 02:37:06,956
[SPEAKER_09]: Flash-based games, if you know what I mean.

2093
02:37:07,616 --> 02:37:13,757
[SPEAKER_09]: But, like, installing said game on hard drive, playing, you know, against people.

2094
02:37:14,697 --> 02:37:18,118
[SPEAKER_09]: The more... The higher intensity stuff.

2095
02:37:18,358 --> 02:37:27,620
[SPEAKER_09]: I think multiplayer games, you know, again, installed content, console-type things, yes, those count.

2096
02:37:27,820 --> 02:37:28,500
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a gamer.

2097
02:37:28,800 --> 02:37:29,000
[SPEAKER_09]: But...

2098
02:37:30,061 --> 02:37:48,938
[SPEAKER_09]: if you play mostly puzzlers and things you're going to be looped into that casual category and I think that hardcore if I'm going to even go a bit further into generalizations we're looking at a very um what's the word that I'm thinking of um

2099
02:37:52,032 --> 02:37:55,033
[SPEAKER_09]: Gender-related type of theme.

2100
02:37:56,434 --> 02:38:00,676
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to try and nail down this definition a lot quicker.

2101
02:38:01,536 --> 02:38:05,478
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a gamer is someone who has an appreciation for game culture.

2102
02:38:05,878 --> 02:38:07,039
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a gaming enthusiast.

2103
02:38:07,619 --> 02:38:12,922
[SPEAKER_03]: If you went to the trouble to download this podcast and email it, you care about games enough.

2104
02:38:13,022 --> 02:38:13,982
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you're a gamer.

2105
02:38:15,303 --> 02:38:18,064
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have ever bought a gaming magazine off the shelf,

2106
02:38:18,544 --> 02:38:20,206
[SPEAKER_03]: You have an interest in gaming culture.

2107
02:38:20,226 --> 02:38:21,888
[SPEAKER_09]: We do have non-gamers that listen, by the way.

2108
02:38:23,070 --> 02:38:24,151
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's possible, sure.

2109
02:38:24,772 --> 02:38:27,075
[SPEAKER_03]: We probably have a lot of food fans at the rate this show is going.

2110
02:38:28,477 --> 02:38:36,887
[SPEAKER_03]: If you are somebody who has ever watched a television program about video games because you are interested in the content...

2111
02:38:37,888 --> 02:38:39,209
[SPEAKER_03]: You're probably a gamer.

2112
02:38:39,830 --> 02:38:43,373
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a gamer is just somebody who has an active interest in gaming culture.

2113
02:38:43,713 --> 02:38:55,423
[SPEAKER_03]: And somebody who does Farmville and that's it probably really isn't a gamer because they don't have an interest in the culture of games and why we play them and what motivates us and what keeps our interest.

2114
02:38:55,463 --> 02:38:55,863
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?

2115
02:38:56,244 --> 02:39:01,228
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's like, you know, the other definition of gamer is, of course, tabletop.

2116
02:39:02,970 --> 02:39:08,314
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, it's like, I can sit down, when I play Monopoly, am I playing a game?

2117
02:39:08,954 --> 02:39:11,016
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm playing as much of a game as I am playing Street Fighter.

2118
02:39:11,056 --> 02:39:13,017
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a game, it's for entertainment.

2119
02:39:13,618 --> 02:39:15,599
[SPEAKER_09]: But I don't collect Monopoly memorabilia.

2120
02:39:16,680 --> 02:39:19,662
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I'm not a board gamer, I guess.

2121
02:39:21,163 --> 02:39:29,689
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why I'm trying to look at it is by, and to put it back to this way, it's not what you have, it's what you do with it.

2122
02:39:30,750 --> 02:39:31,651
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, that sounded dirty.

2123
02:39:32,365 --> 02:39:53,609
[SPEAKER_09]: um it's the games that you have the games that you enjoy and if you play them all the time that's pretty hardcore you know and if you make it a part of your life I think that may like you were saying if you make it a part of your life then you're a gamer and your friend's a hater and your friend's a hater your friend's just judging you all right

2124
02:39:55,601 --> 02:40:05,730
[SPEAKER_03]: And TigerClaw in our chatroom says this If this so-called friend had been saying that, all that Then that is not a friend at all You get the impression that they don't want to be around you Just because you like games that they don't

2125
02:40:07,697 --> 02:40:14,362
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if it's necessarily that severe, but your friend just kind of, in regards to this topic, needs to pull his head out of his butt.

2126
02:40:14,422 --> 02:40:15,442
[SPEAKER_09]: Tiara told me something funny.

2127
02:40:15,462 --> 02:40:15,823
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?

2128
02:40:16,823 --> 02:40:20,566
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're playing Monopoly, you may not be a board gamer, you might be a board gamer.

2129
02:40:21,807 --> 02:40:22,747
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, play on words.

2130
02:40:24,108 --> 02:40:25,830
[SPEAKER_03]: She's a grammar enthusiast.

2131
02:40:25,930 --> 02:40:26,210
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

2132
02:40:27,491 --> 02:40:27,791
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow.

2133
02:40:27,831 --> 02:40:30,613
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, I get pretty bored once, you know, all the big streets are bought up.

2134
02:40:31,033 --> 02:40:31,975
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that it for the mailbag?

2135
02:40:32,615 --> 02:40:33,597
[SPEAKER_03]: It's over!

2136
02:40:33,657 --> 02:40:37,623
[SPEAKER_03]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com The mailbag is closed.

2137
02:40:37,703 --> 02:40:42,770
[SPEAKER_03]: It's time for us to do a little bit of ranting in a segment we like to call the F-Years of the Week.

2138
02:41:02,512 --> 02:41:10,734
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a number of FUs, but one of them is... What was it I was ranting about when you guys came in today?

2139
02:41:11,594 --> 02:41:12,134
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't remember.

2140
02:41:12,154 --> 02:41:14,094
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember.

2141
02:41:15,295 --> 02:41:15,875
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't remember.

2142
02:41:17,415 --> 02:41:20,816
[SPEAKER_03]: Just... When I came in here, you were talking about those booty shorts.

2143
02:41:22,016 --> 02:41:22,436
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, okay.

2144
02:41:22,916 --> 02:41:28,297
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got a lot of really good stuff happening to me this week, so I'd say FU to not having enough time.

2145
02:41:30,498 --> 02:41:31,398
[SPEAKER_09]: And stupid drivers!

2146
02:41:34,088 --> 02:41:39,272
[SPEAKER_11]: I also feel a lack of time, especially since I have to take care of the baby and I don't sleep very much anymore.

2147
02:41:40,392 --> 02:41:45,496
[SPEAKER_11]: I go to bed at like 11 and I have to wake up again to feed him.

2148
02:41:45,556 --> 02:41:51,900
[SPEAKER_11]: Like last night, I actually was trying to go to bed at like 9 because I anticipate getting up way early in the morning.

2149
02:41:52,821 --> 02:42:00,466
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I tried to put him down at 10 and he just kept fussing and would not go to sleep until about midnight.

2150
02:42:04,028 --> 02:42:13,656
[SPEAKER_11]: A couple hours and then wake up usually with him around 4 o'clock in the morning or 5 o'clock in the morning, sometimes 6 o'clock in the morning and we're up until I have to go to work.

2151
02:42:14,416 --> 02:42:20,742
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, multiply that times infinite and it really sucks.

2152
02:42:21,302 --> 02:42:25,926
[SPEAKER_11]: But just the lack of time to actually get to work on my Grand Theft Auto mods and stuff like that.

2153
02:42:26,526 --> 02:42:29,228
[SPEAKER_11]: and also an FU to just plain shitty drivers.

2154
02:42:29,288 --> 02:42:31,830
[SPEAKER_11]: I was behind this old... Well, I thought it was an old man.

2155
02:42:31,850 --> 02:42:32,931
[SPEAKER_11]: It ended up being an old woman.

2156
02:42:33,352 --> 02:42:38,856
[SPEAKER_11]: But she was obviously lost and didn't know where she was going or she was looking for a turn of some sort.

2157
02:42:39,256 --> 02:42:48,624
[SPEAKER_11]: And so she was driving really slow and then finally, it was funny and kind of ironic, blew through a red light and then it got caught by the red light camera.

2158
02:42:48,704 --> 02:42:48,884
[SPEAKER_11]: So...

2159
02:42:49,805 --> 02:42:51,246
[SPEAKER_11]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2160
02:43:11,121 --> 02:43:15,025
[SPEAKER_11]: My god, you treat this shit like it's high school with all the fucking drama and stuff.

2161
02:43:15,105 --> 02:43:19,408
[SPEAKER_11]: Some people are asking questions and you're like, well, I'm too good to answer your fucking questions.

2162
02:43:20,129 --> 02:43:21,731
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, fuck them.

2163
02:43:22,451 --> 02:43:30,438
[SPEAKER_11]: And fuck you for deleting my post just because I'm explaining how to do things because you want to claim to be the first person that's ever done this thing.

2164
02:43:30,478 --> 02:43:33,441
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe you should stop hanging on web forums with 14 and 15 year old boys.

2165
02:43:34,696 --> 02:43:37,619
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I try not to, but it's very limited.

2166
02:43:38,881 --> 02:43:45,849
[SPEAKER_11]: Modding the Xbox 360 version of Grand Theft Auto, it's very limited in the amount of message boards out there for that.

2167
02:43:45,889 --> 02:43:51,355
[SPEAKER_11]: Trust me, if there was a different source, a more mature form that I could go to, I would love to be there.

2168
02:43:52,156 --> 02:43:52,837
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2169
02:44:15,158 --> 02:44:22,082
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we ended up getting rerouted to another flight that was delayed for like three hours and it's kind of like they could have given us a better heads up about the delay.

2170
02:44:22,122 --> 02:44:23,262
[SPEAKER_03]: I was a little irritated.

2171
02:44:23,802 --> 02:44:25,763
[SPEAKER_03]: Some parts of that situation just seemed preventable.

2172
02:44:26,764 --> 02:44:33,007
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a pretty resilient person and I like to think I was able to let that situation kind of roll off my back as kind of like one of those funny life experiences.

2173
02:44:33,447 --> 02:44:39,310
[SPEAKER_03]: But I did feel really bad for my friend who was supposed to be a birthday trip for her and it's just, you know, really bummed out about it and

2174
02:44:40,131 --> 02:44:40,951
[SPEAKER_03]: I can understand.

2175
02:44:41,232 --> 02:44:42,633
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of sucks to have that happen.

2176
02:44:43,674 --> 02:44:47,358
[SPEAKER_03]: So, just F you to shit happening.

2177
02:44:47,879 --> 02:44:49,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Because sometimes it does.

2178
02:44:49,621 --> 02:44:50,362
[SPEAKER_03]: Shit happens.

2179
02:44:50,962 --> 02:44:52,284
[SPEAKER_03]: There ain't anything you can do about it.

2180
02:44:53,485 --> 02:44:55,107
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, meanwhile, back to the show.

2181
02:44:55,427 --> 02:44:57,730
[SPEAKER_03]: Couple news stories for you guys, and then the Skype line!

2182
02:44:58,789 --> 02:45:00,130
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, it's kind of interesting.

2183
02:45:00,170 --> 02:45:03,892
[SPEAKER_11]: There is a whole trademark dispute over Mafia Wars.

2184
02:45:04,692 --> 02:45:12,176
[SPEAKER_11]: Digital Chocolate is claiming that they had the trademark Mafia Wars for their, I believe, is an iPhone game.

2185
02:45:13,276 --> 02:45:21,261
[SPEAKER_11]: And then, of course, Zynga has their Mafia Wars game that came out later on that was on Facebook and PC and whatnot.

2186
02:45:21,761 --> 02:45:27,924
[SPEAKER_11]: And, of course, now their Mafia Wars game has all sorts of different marketing with Seven

2187
02:45:28,244 --> 02:45:28,905
[SPEAKER_11]: and that kind of stuff.

2188
02:45:29,605 --> 02:45:43,414
[SPEAKER_11]: It says the United States Patent and Trademark Office lists Zynga's first filing date for the game under the name Mafia Wars as July 1st 2009 although no filing under that name could be located with Digital Chocolate as the applicant.

2189
02:45:43,454 --> 02:45:48,677
[SPEAKER_11]: Digital Chocolate has not responded of course to the request by Joystick in this case.

2190
02:45:49,537 --> 02:45:50,938
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course you know it's

2191
02:45:52,259 --> 02:45:52,699
[SPEAKER_11]: Settlement Settlement

2192
02:46:15,538 --> 02:46:17,259
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, one more story for you guys.

2193
02:46:17,299 --> 02:46:19,481
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I should get that Skype line ready to go, shouldn't I?

2194
02:46:19,541 --> 02:46:20,522
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2195
02:46:20,542 --> 02:46:21,643
[SPEAKER_03]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2196
02:46:21,703 --> 02:46:22,724
[SPEAKER_03]: Username is Skype.

2197
02:46:22,744 --> 02:46:23,505
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to start calling.

2198
02:46:23,865 --> 02:46:26,868
[SPEAKER_03]: But meanwhile, I got one more story for you guys.

2199
02:46:26,988 --> 02:46:28,890
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is very interesting.

2200
02:46:28,930 --> 02:46:30,711
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's one of those things I looked at and I was like, really?

2201
02:46:30,772 --> 02:46:31,812
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this real life?

2202
02:46:32,013 --> 02:46:32,653
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even know.

2203
02:46:33,534 --> 02:46:33,894
[SPEAKER_03]: What is this?

2204
02:46:33,934 --> 02:46:34,495
[SPEAKER_03]: I cannot even.

2205
02:46:35,816 --> 02:46:39,299
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a game called The Bible Online.

2206
02:46:39,900 --> 02:46:40,420
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

2207
02:46:41,201 --> 02:46:41,761
[SPEAKER_03]: This is real.

2208
02:46:41,841 --> 02:46:53,306
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a game called The Bible Online where you will get to slip into the role of Abraham and his descendants and have the opportunity to reenact and witness the incidents of their times.

2209
02:46:54,366 --> 02:46:55,807
[SPEAKER_03]: The game will be split into chapters.

2210
02:46:55,907 --> 02:46:57,927
[SPEAKER_03]: The heroes will be the first one that comes out.

2211
02:46:58,408 --> 02:47:00,588
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically an MMO strategy game.

2212
02:47:00,628 --> 02:47:01,809
[SPEAKER_03]: You control your own tribe.

2213
02:47:01,849 --> 02:47:02,629
[SPEAKER_03]: You build a city.

2214
02:47:02,729 --> 02:47:04,250
[SPEAKER_03]: You wage war in the name of God.

2215
02:47:06,991 --> 02:47:27,683
[SPEAKER_03]: I see why I mean like this almost sounds like a joke like I just don't even get it but apparently there's a website it's thebible-onlinegame.com complete with side quests, role playing elements and there you go that's what it's all about no word yet if there's gonna be you know other religious texts what?

2216
02:47:29,083 --> 02:47:30,584
[SPEAKER_09]: have you actually looked at the screen captures on it?

2217
02:47:31,245 --> 02:47:33,046
[SPEAKER_09]: I did it's super dinky

2218
02:47:34,697 --> 02:47:36,218
[SPEAKER_03]: I almost think it's not real.

2219
02:47:36,478 --> 02:47:37,519
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it is.

2220
02:47:37,659 --> 02:47:37,979
[SPEAKER_03]: It's real.

2221
02:47:38,219 --> 02:47:39,140
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a beta sign up.

2222
02:47:39,240 --> 02:47:40,440
[SPEAKER_09]: It's stinky.

2223
02:47:40,520 --> 02:47:44,122
[SPEAKER_09]: It reminds me of a late 90s strategy game.

2224
02:47:44,943 --> 02:47:46,464
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's Bibleville?

2225
02:47:47,204 --> 02:47:49,945
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they going to have the Koran online?

2226
02:47:50,066 --> 02:47:53,107
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they going to be equal opportunity and do a Koran online?

2227
02:47:54,368 --> 02:47:54,688
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

2228
02:47:54,828 --> 02:47:56,769
[SPEAKER_03]: Just don't put it too close to ground zero.

2229
02:47:59,531 --> 02:47:59,851
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow.

2230
02:48:01,846 --> 02:48:02,427
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on.

2231
02:48:02,827 --> 02:48:03,388
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you making food?

2232
02:48:03,408 --> 02:48:04,109
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you making me food?

2233
02:48:04,129 --> 02:48:04,929
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want food.

2234
02:48:04,949 --> 02:48:05,670
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want a taco?

2235
02:48:05,730 --> 02:48:06,411
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want a taco.

2236
02:48:06,431 --> 02:48:06,671
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm fine.

2237
02:48:06,691 --> 02:48:08,053
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been sitting here hungry.

2238
02:48:08,513 --> 02:48:09,194
[SPEAKER_09]: Then make a taco.

2239
02:48:09,354 --> 02:48:09,995
[SPEAKER_09]: Watching Loki.

2240
02:48:10,055 --> 02:48:10,415
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll eat.

2241
02:48:10,495 --> 02:48:10,656
[SPEAKER_03]: Fine.

2242
02:48:10,676 --> 02:48:11,597
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll take calls without you.

2243
02:48:12,558 --> 02:48:13,559
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll be in here back in a second.

2244
02:48:13,579 --> 02:48:14,219
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm also making my taco.

2245
02:48:14,239 --> 02:48:15,080
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you want me to make you a taco?

2246
02:48:15,221 --> 02:48:16,061
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't want a taco.

2247
02:48:16,142 --> 02:48:16,522
[SPEAKER_03]: Then fine.

2248
02:48:16,602 --> 02:48:17,103
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be right back.

2249
02:48:17,183 --> 02:48:17,363
[SPEAKER_08]: Fine.

2250
02:48:18,140 --> 02:48:18,560
[SPEAKER_03]: Taco!

2251
02:48:18,701 --> 02:48:19,501
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to send Dan in?

2252
02:48:19,521 --> 02:48:20,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe Dan wants to talk to some listeners.

2253
02:48:20,783 --> 02:48:21,964
[SPEAKER_09]: Dan, you want to talk to some listeners?

2254
02:48:22,464 --> 02:48:23,946
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just have Dan answer the phones tonight.

2255
02:48:24,026 --> 02:48:25,107
[SPEAKER_09]: Dan, come answer the phones!

2256
02:48:27,829 --> 02:48:29,271
[SPEAKER_09]: He's busy playing something.

2257
02:48:29,291 --> 02:48:29,771
[SPEAKER_03]: What's he playing?

2258
02:48:30,071 --> 02:48:30,352
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know?

2259
02:48:30,572 --> 02:48:30,912
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

2260
02:48:30,992 --> 02:48:31,553
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, he's coming.

2261
02:48:31,573 --> 02:48:32,413
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you playing?

2262
02:48:32,454 --> 02:48:32,794
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, Dan.

2263
02:48:32,994 --> 02:48:34,255
[SPEAKER_07]: Dan, you want to answer the phones tonight?

2264
02:48:34,816 --> 02:48:35,076
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

2265
02:48:35,276 --> 02:48:36,678
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, Skyplane with Dan!

2266
02:48:37,358 --> 02:48:40,261
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so you're just going to say, Hi, this is Orange Haunts Radio.

2267
02:48:40,421 --> 02:48:40,821
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Dan.

2268
02:48:40,841 --> 02:48:41,262
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you want?

2269
02:48:41,522 --> 02:48:42,983
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, this is DJ Blaziken This is who?

2270
02:48:43,543 --> 02:48:43,983
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Blaziken

2271
02:49:05,438 --> 02:49:07,059
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Blaziken.

2272
02:49:07,279 --> 02:49:08,000
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, good.

2273
02:49:08,901 --> 02:49:09,561
[SPEAKER_04]: Good to hear from you.

2274
02:49:09,601 --> 02:49:10,142
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up, man?

2275
02:49:10,262 --> 02:49:10,802
[SPEAKER_04]: How you doing?

2276
02:49:11,263 --> 02:49:12,083
[SPEAKER_04]: What can we do for you?

2277
02:49:12,103 --> 02:49:16,787
[SPEAKER_01]: Not much other than I just got done with a Silent Hill in the dark session.

2278
02:49:18,548 --> 02:49:18,909
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

2279
02:49:20,290 --> 02:49:21,511
[SPEAKER_01]: Creepy as hell.

2280
02:49:21,711 --> 02:49:25,454
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the question is, did you have surround sound?

2281
02:49:26,795 --> 02:49:31,939
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm playing Homecoming for the 360, and I actually unplugged the 360 audio cables

2282
02:49:32,287 --> 02:49:35,428
[SPEAKER_01]: I plugged in my PSP audio cable for the stream.

2283
02:49:36,168 --> 02:49:39,809
[SPEAKER_01]: And so basically I'm listening to you guys while playing Silent Hill.

2284
02:49:40,650 --> 02:49:45,851
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of getting rid of some of the creepiness, but monsters coming out of the woodwork out of nowhere.

2285
02:49:46,992 --> 02:49:48,532
[SPEAKER_01]: Makes you jump out of a chair.

2286
02:49:48,552 --> 02:49:52,794
[SPEAKER_04]: See, that's a giant mistake, because Silent Hill is well known for its incredible sound design.

2287
02:49:53,254 --> 02:49:57,215
[SPEAKER_04]: You play that on surround sound system in the dark, it's going to fuck you up for life.

2288
02:49:59,503 --> 02:50:02,865
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, trust me, I've been screwed for life by Silent Hill years ago.

2289
02:50:02,885 --> 02:50:04,887
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I trust you, but I don't really want to hear about it.

2290
02:50:06,267 --> 02:50:08,869
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no, it was back on the old PlayStation 1.

2291
02:50:09,029 --> 02:50:11,631
[SPEAKER_01]: I played it probably, I played a demo.

2292
02:50:11,851 --> 02:50:13,372
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, I'm in the middle of a call.

2293
02:50:14,493 --> 02:50:21,877
[SPEAKER_01]: The demo of Silent Hill 1 basically creeped me the heck out when I was like 10, okay?

2294
02:50:22,458 --> 02:50:22,838
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

2295
02:50:23,697 --> 02:50:25,518
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you probably shouldn't have been playing that when you were 10.

2296
02:50:25,998 --> 02:50:27,879
[SPEAKER_04]: It must mean your parents don't care about you.

2297
02:50:30,019 --> 02:50:30,460
[SPEAKER_01]: I gotta go.

2298
02:50:31,260 --> 02:50:32,220
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been kicked out of the room.

2299
02:50:32,500 --> 02:50:32,881
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

2300
02:50:33,621 --> 02:50:35,322
[SPEAKER_04]: It's good to hear from you.

2301
02:50:36,182 --> 02:50:36,702
[SPEAKER_03]: Give me that!

2302
02:50:37,342 --> 02:50:37,863
[SPEAKER_04]: Stay black.

2303
02:50:38,563 --> 02:50:39,663
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for the call.

2304
02:50:39,783 --> 02:50:40,383
[SPEAKER_03]: Take care.

2305
02:50:41,364 --> 02:50:41,744
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.

2306
02:50:41,764 --> 02:50:42,424
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell?

2307
02:50:42,724 --> 02:50:43,245
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

2308
02:50:43,345 --> 02:50:43,645
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.

2309
02:50:43,665 --> 02:50:44,405
[SPEAKER_09]: That's my husband.

2310
02:50:44,425 --> 02:50:45,265
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to live with this.

2311
02:50:48,550 --> 02:50:51,213
[SPEAKER_03]: Did he really just end that call with stay black?

2312
02:50:51,393 --> 02:51:01,405
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even... Did it occur to you that he's not black, Dan?

2313
02:51:03,447 --> 02:51:04,929
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, moving on.

2314
02:51:05,109 --> 02:51:05,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's take another call.

2315
02:51:05,910 --> 02:51:06,911
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess Dan left the room.

2316
02:51:06,951 --> 02:51:07,552
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's move on.

2317
02:51:10,607 --> 02:51:11,788
[SPEAKER_03]: You're on Orange Launch Radio.

2318
02:51:11,828 --> 02:51:12,248
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

2319
02:51:12,928 --> 02:51:13,809
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Ranma.

2320
02:51:13,829 --> 02:51:16,690
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to know, did you do that on purpose or what?

2321
02:51:16,950 --> 02:51:18,891
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, really, that was just excellent timing.

2322
02:51:18,951 --> 02:51:19,812
[SPEAKER_03]: Do what on purpose?

2323
02:51:21,273 --> 02:51:22,633
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, you know exactly what I'm talking about.

2324
02:51:22,653 --> 02:51:23,694
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole chat room knows.

2325
02:51:24,054 --> 02:51:28,316
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no, but I would have closed the phone call with that if you want.

2326
02:51:30,117 --> 02:51:35,320
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, Dan just yelled from the living room, Ranma, stay black.

2327
02:51:36,544 --> 02:51:38,125
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell them to stay white.

2328
02:51:39,046 --> 02:51:41,048
[SPEAKER_03]: Ranma says to stay white.

2329
02:51:41,068 --> 02:51:46,171
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't think that was something that could be changed very easily unless you're like Ted Danson.

2330
02:51:46,211 --> 02:51:48,653
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it has to do with those old 70s movies.

2331
02:51:49,474 --> 02:51:53,496
[SPEAKER_07]: Just keep in mind, in the Hebrew Hammer, there's a line, Shlomo, stay Jewish.

2332
02:51:54,237 --> 02:51:56,579
[SPEAKER_03]: Once in a while, it's a video game talk show.

2333
02:51:56,839 --> 02:51:59,201
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you've played any games this week, Ranma, but...

2334
02:52:00,223 --> 02:52:01,125
[SPEAKER_02]: I have.

2335
02:52:02,647 --> 02:52:07,393
[SPEAKER_02]: I have been playing Scott Pilgrim vs. the World for the last four to five days.

2336
02:52:07,774 --> 02:52:09,336
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I played the demo actually this week.

2337
02:52:09,356 --> 02:52:12,621
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't talk about it because I got consumed with the Lara Croft game, but what do you think?

2338
02:52:14,013 --> 02:52:19,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyone that loves River City Ransom, get your ass on Xbox Live or PlayStation Network and get this game.

2339
02:52:19,940 --> 02:52:20,861
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

2340
02:52:20,941 --> 02:52:23,043
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just River City Ransom 2, isn't it?

2341
02:52:23,363 --> 02:52:24,044
[SPEAKER_03]: It really is.

2342
02:52:24,625 --> 02:52:27,508
[SPEAKER_02]: With all the gaming references, my god.

2343
02:52:27,828 --> 02:52:31,913
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm a type of person where I will play through a game and I'm pretty much done with it.

2344
02:52:31,933 --> 02:52:32,693
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't pick it up again.

2345
02:52:34,535 --> 02:52:37,418
[SPEAKER_02]: First day, me and my roommate, we finished the game in four and a half hours.

2346
02:52:37,618 --> 02:52:40,662
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple of days later, I jump on the game and plow right through it.

2347
02:52:40,882 --> 02:52:44,465
[SPEAKER_02]: And I played through the game again last night to like 4.30 in the morning.

2348
02:52:45,530 --> 02:52:46,530
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good time.

2349
02:52:46,590 --> 02:52:51,532
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like me on the Lara Croft game, but obviously this is for different reasons.

2350
02:52:51,852 --> 02:52:56,173
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it just the nostalgia factor that's getting you, or are you really having fun just kind of button mashing and beating them up?

2351
02:52:56,954 --> 02:52:57,374
[SPEAKER_02]: All of that.

2352
02:52:57,474 --> 02:53:02,495
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, hell, I actually went out and bought an arcade fighter joystick just to play this game with.

2353
02:53:02,755 --> 02:53:02,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

2354
02:53:02,955 --> 02:53:06,056
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just automatically adjusted to the joystick and played through the game.

2355
02:53:06,256 --> 02:53:07,417
[SPEAKER_02]: That is hardcore.

2356
02:53:07,957 --> 02:53:08,177
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

2357
02:53:08,837 --> 02:53:09,658
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.

2358
02:53:09,698 --> 02:53:09,878
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

2359
02:53:11,471 --> 02:53:15,213
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell us a little bit about how the game kind of changes as it progresses.

2360
02:53:15,273 --> 02:53:20,775
[SPEAKER_03]: Because something I noticed, like, in the demo I was playing, I was like, okay, well, this is kind of, you know, repetitive.

2361
02:53:20,835 --> 02:53:22,256
[SPEAKER_03]: It's button mashing, da-da-da.

2362
02:53:22,556 --> 02:53:25,737
[SPEAKER_03]: But then I noticed, like, as you level up, oh, you start getting new moves.

2363
02:53:25,817 --> 02:53:29,219
[SPEAKER_03]: And then as you go into the shops, you can kind of enhance the strength and so forth.

2364
02:53:29,519 --> 02:53:32,340
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that kind of evolution continue as you move on?

2365
02:53:33,121 --> 02:53:34,221
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, something like that.

2366
02:53:34,301 --> 02:53:40,924
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, as every level goes on, the game gets progressively harder and harder, but you get more coins and more money.

2367
02:53:42,319 --> 02:53:42,840
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2368
02:54:01,758 --> 02:54:04,859
[SPEAKER_02]: That and I looked at the leaderboards of my friends.

2369
02:54:04,959 --> 02:54:10,001
[SPEAKER_02]: I was determined to pretty much get to the top of the ladder out of my friends list, which I did.

2370
02:54:11,981 --> 02:54:16,523
[SPEAKER_02]: Last I recall, I'm ranked like 2,200 and everybody else is like in the 4,000s.

2371
02:54:17,023 --> 02:54:21,004
[SPEAKER_03]: That still means there's 2,199 people better than you.

2372
02:54:22,004 --> 02:54:25,285
[SPEAKER_02]: That means I'm going to have to go through every single one of them to get to the top.

2373
02:54:25,505 --> 02:54:26,066
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

2374
02:54:26,986 --> 02:54:30,067
[SPEAKER_02]: Number one guy has like over $9 million in the game.

2375
02:54:30,107 --> 02:54:30,547
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, well...

2376
02:54:31,351 --> 02:54:33,132
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got my work cut off for myself.

2377
02:54:33,372 --> 02:54:36,553
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good thing he's not playing Final Fantasy XIV or he would have got cut off by now.

2378
02:54:37,134 --> 02:54:37,474
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2379
02:54:38,074 --> 02:54:40,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Any other thoughts for our listeners tonight, Ranma, before I take some more calls?

2380
02:54:41,616 --> 02:54:49,859
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to talk about the whole online passing, but we'll save that for another time because that's like another 10 minutes of me ranting and losing my mind.

2381
02:54:49,959 --> 02:54:50,239
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2382
02:54:50,660 --> 02:54:51,220
[SPEAKER_03]: No problem.

2383
02:54:51,580 --> 02:54:54,721
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure there'll sadly be more stories on it as we move on.

2384
02:54:54,801 --> 02:54:57,563
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's folks asking for your gamer tag in chat, so you might want to share.

2385
02:54:58,323 --> 02:55:00,305
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'll type it out in the chat room right now.

2386
02:55:00,886 --> 02:55:03,148
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well, Ranma, thank you so much for calling in.

2387
02:55:03,308 --> 02:55:05,730
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a great week, and of course, stay black, my friend.

2388
02:55:06,251 --> 02:55:06,711
[SPEAKER_03]: L'chaim!

2389
02:55:06,971 --> 02:55:07,832
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, take care.

2390
02:55:12,797 --> 02:55:14,819
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go to the phones and take another call.

2391
02:55:14,899 --> 02:55:16,660
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on... I had my mouth full of taco.

2392
02:55:16,681 --> 02:55:18,322
[SPEAKER_07]: You had your mouth full... Was that a taco laugh?

2393
02:55:18,923 --> 02:55:19,783
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, I've got another call.

2394
02:55:19,823 --> 02:55:20,804
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2395
02:55:20,824 --> 02:55:21,165
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

2396
02:55:21,946 --> 02:55:22,927
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, it's Tiara!

2397
02:55:23,207 --> 02:55:24,528
[SPEAKER_03]: Tiara, my friend!

2398
02:55:24,588 --> 02:55:26,269
[SPEAKER_03]: Long time no chat, how are you?

2399
02:55:26,829 --> 02:55:28,330
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm doing very good, how are you?

2400
02:55:28,470 --> 02:55:31,011
[SPEAKER_03]: I am great, but I'd be better if I was in Vegas.

2401
02:55:31,992 --> 02:55:38,956
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, and speaking of Vegas, the reason I called is because I have to tell you about the This is Vegas game.

2402
02:55:39,616 --> 02:55:46,180
[SPEAKER_06]: The reason that they're not making it anymore is because I had to send out a cease and desist letter because they were copying my life.

2403
02:55:46,781 --> 02:55:47,021
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

2404
02:55:47,041 --> 02:55:47,121
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

2405
02:55:48,211 --> 02:55:56,317
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, I didn't mind, you know, the dancing, the gambling, you know, going out on the strip, but when they got to the part with punching people, I had to draw a line.

2406
02:55:56,878 --> 02:55:57,418
[SPEAKER_03]: I see.

2407
02:55:57,578 --> 02:56:03,443
[SPEAKER_03]: So, basically, because it was an unauthorized biography of Tiara, you had to cease and desist them.

2408
02:56:04,203 --> 02:56:04,784
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

2409
02:56:05,304 --> 02:56:07,686
[SPEAKER_03]: Ruining gamer dreams everywhere.

2410
02:56:08,246 --> 02:56:08,567
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

2411
02:56:08,627 --> 02:56:11,068
[SPEAKER_06]: I also had to put a stop on Boobville, so that's...

2412
02:56:11,809 --> 02:56:12,129
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

2413
02:56:31,345 --> 02:56:55,795
[SPEAKER_03]: and I played it and I played it for a while and it was like it sucked up a couple of hours of my life because it's kind of addicting it is very addicting which is weird because it's kind of stupid like I'm playing this game and I'm like this game is so stupid but I keep hoping that I'll get picked to play clock game and then I'm like oh if I get to level five I'll get to unlock a new pricing game and I'm really excited about that why because I'm a sad person you have Plinko

2414
02:56:56,676 --> 02:56:57,156
[SPEAKER_03]: Not yet.

2415
02:56:57,296 --> 02:57:03,678
[SPEAKER_03]: All I ever see... Well, the game is still in beta, but all I ever see is Clock Game and Safe Crackers.

2416
02:57:04,119 --> 02:57:05,759
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I always get Safe Crackers.

2417
02:57:05,839 --> 02:57:08,220
[SPEAKER_03]: There's another one you get to unlock at level 5.

2418
02:57:08,840 --> 02:57:10,921
[SPEAKER_03]: But I have found that I am a terrible shopper.

2419
02:57:11,041 --> 02:57:14,102
[SPEAKER_03]: I have yet to be called up to play a pricing game.

2420
02:57:14,502 --> 02:57:18,364
[SPEAKER_03]: But, but, but, this is important, I am an awesome wheel spinner.

2421
02:57:18,864 --> 02:57:21,205
[SPEAKER_03]: And I almost always get 95 cents or a dollar.

2422
02:57:21,385 --> 02:57:21,825
[SPEAKER_03]: Just saying.

2423
02:57:22,862 --> 02:57:23,242
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, nice.

2424
02:57:23,382 --> 02:57:25,784
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I always weigh under bid.

2425
02:57:26,484 --> 02:57:38,751
[SPEAKER_06]: The things that they have for bid, it's like nobody's going to pay as much money as the game says, and it seems like it's way more overpriced than the actual Price is Right television show.

2426
02:57:38,871 --> 02:57:51,598
[SPEAKER_03]: You just have to remember real people like you and me shop at places like Ikea and Target, and the Price is Right apparently buys all of their stuff at the Galleria, Versace, and all that good stuff.

2427
02:57:52,807 --> 02:57:54,869
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently so, yeah.

2428
02:57:55,149 --> 02:57:56,911
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, I just wanted to call and say hi.

2429
02:57:57,191 --> 02:57:58,472
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, thank you so much for the phone call.

2430
02:57:58,492 --> 02:58:01,215
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll tell you the story behind the This is Vegas.

2431
02:58:01,575 --> 02:58:02,516
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I appreciate it.

2432
02:58:02,656 --> 02:58:07,741
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish you would stop ruining the dreams of gamers everywhere, but maybe you'll let us have something fun in the future.

2433
02:58:08,325 --> 02:58:12,247
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you guys can come down to Vegas and I'll show you around.

2434
02:58:12,287 --> 02:58:16,029
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I would love to do if I don't have anything else planned this year?

2435
02:58:16,169 --> 02:58:18,270
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love to take a Christmas trip to Vegas.

2436
02:58:19,010 --> 02:58:20,471
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that would be fun.

2437
02:58:20,551 --> 02:58:22,972
[SPEAKER_06]: Christmas ain't no big deal to you anymore, right?

2438
02:58:22,992 --> 02:58:24,072
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go.

2439
02:58:24,512 --> 02:58:27,274
[SPEAKER_06]: Depending on if I get a certain house.

2440
02:58:27,314 --> 02:58:28,354
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'm shopping for a house.

2441
02:58:28,574 --> 02:58:30,915
[SPEAKER_06]: If I get one with an extra bedroom, you could probably even crash.

2442
02:58:30,935 --> 02:58:31,936
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be awesome.

2443
02:58:32,822 --> 02:58:36,865
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yes, and just so the chat knows, yes, Tiara has some type of clicking sound in the background.

2444
02:58:37,145 --> 02:58:39,987
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll just say Clicky the pen is trying to infiltrate Orange Lounge Radio.

2445
02:58:40,007 --> 02:58:40,788
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll just leave it at that.

2446
02:58:40,828 --> 02:58:41,628
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what that's all about.

2447
02:58:41,648 --> 02:58:42,129
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn, Clicky.

2448
02:58:42,349 --> 02:58:42,949
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn, Clicky.

2449
02:58:43,410 --> 02:58:44,350
[SPEAKER_06]: It returned.

2450
02:58:44,611 --> 02:58:45,811
[SPEAKER_06]: The ghost of Clicky passed.

2451
02:58:45,831 --> 02:58:46,492
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I don't know.

2452
02:58:46,592 --> 02:58:49,834
[SPEAKER_06]: This mic is very, very crazy with the clicking.

2453
02:58:49,934 --> 02:58:51,315
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes it comes up.

2454
02:58:51,456 --> 02:58:53,317
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes it just randomly disappears.

2455
02:58:53,637 --> 02:59:01,743
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's actually the doctor is coming to kidnap me, and it's the sonic screwdriver, but it's malfunctioning, so it makes a clicky noise instead of a... Well, you did get

2456
02:59:01,863 --> 02:59:02,884
[SPEAKER_06]: The Giggling Girl comic show again?

2457
02:59:27,358 --> 02:59:29,659
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it kind of is, except for there's a dude now.

2458
02:59:29,859 --> 02:59:31,779
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's two giggling girls and a dude.

2459
02:59:32,059 --> 02:59:32,880
[SPEAKER_06]: A giggling dude.

2460
02:59:33,000 --> 02:59:33,900
[SPEAKER_03]: Men ruining everything.

2461
02:59:35,440 --> 02:59:36,100
[SPEAKER_03]: Where can I get it?

2462
02:59:36,181 --> 02:59:36,961
[SPEAKER_03]: Where can I download it?

2463
02:59:37,441 --> 02:59:37,781
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it ready?

2464
02:59:37,841 --> 02:59:47,284
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be on infamousgamers.com and that's infamous without an I. So N-F-A-M-O-U-S gamers.com N Famous Gamers.

2465
02:59:47,744 --> 02:59:48,184
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds good.

2466
02:59:48,979 --> 02:59:49,279
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2467
02:59:49,840 --> 02:59:51,341
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Tiara, thanks so much for your call.

2468
02:59:51,381 --> 02:59:54,223
[SPEAKER_03]: Good luck with the podcast since DarkSakura's on it.

2469
02:59:54,263 --> 02:59:55,864
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure it'll be a challenge.

2470
02:59:56,105 --> 02:59:57,606
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm kidding.

2471
02:59:57,646 --> 02:59:58,366
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kidding.

2472
02:59:58,767 --> 03:00:01,149
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you should see the death stare I just got.

2473
03:00:01,189 --> 03:00:01,949
[SPEAKER_03]: It was pretty awesome.

2474
03:00:02,089 --> 03:00:03,210
[SPEAKER_07]: You owe me ice cream.

2475
03:00:04,471 --> 03:00:05,312
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't eat ice cream.

2476
03:00:05,492 --> 03:00:05,892
[SPEAKER_03]: Good luck.

2477
03:00:07,253 --> 03:00:07,934
[SPEAKER_03]: There's your ice cream.

2478
03:00:07,974 --> 03:00:08,274
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2479
03:00:09,475 --> 03:00:11,217
[SPEAKER_03]: Tiara, thank you so much for your phone call.

2480
03:00:11,577 --> 03:00:12,999
[SPEAKER_03]: Stay black and we'll talk to you next time.

[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

[SPEAKER_03]: Hello?

2496
03:01:12,863 --> 03:01:13,783

03:01:14,964 --> 03:01:15,264
[SPEAKER_03]: You there?

2499
03:01:15,664 --> 03:01:16,344
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope, it ended.

2500
03:01:16,424 --> 03:01:16,925
[SPEAKER_03]: They hung up.

2501
03:01:18,125 --> 03:01:19,186
[SPEAKER_03]: Trigger finger, I don't know.

2502
03:01:19,406 --> 03:01:20,166
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go to another call.

2503
03:01:20,206 --> 03:01:21,127
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2504
03:01:21,147 --> 03:01:21,467
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

03:01:23,799 --> 03:01:24,500
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you, my friend?

2508
03:01:25,021 --> 03:01:25,622
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing good.

2510
03:01:27,064 --> 03:01:32,053
[SPEAKER_00]: Watching my fiance over here playing on my iTouch, the How Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader, so...

2511
03:01:32,982 --> 03:01:34,202
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, that show.

2512
03:01:34,702 --> 03:01:37,483
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't believe they let Jeff Foxworthy host a game show.

2513
03:01:37,903 --> 03:01:43,404
[SPEAKER_00]: But speaking of game shows, the prices right on Facebook is a complete crap.

2514
03:01:43,784 --> 03:01:44,144
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?

2515
03:01:44,665 --> 03:01:45,965
[SPEAKER_08]: You are hating, alright?

2516
03:01:46,005 --> 03:01:46,705
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm hating it.

2517
03:01:46,825 --> 03:01:47,505
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are you hating it?

2518
03:01:47,545 --> 03:01:50,746
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a completely watered down version of the PC game.

2519
03:01:50,766 --> 03:01:56,407
[SPEAKER_00]: Just spend 20 bucks by the PC game, just go through it and you can unlock every single one of those games and play as much as you want.

2520
03:01:57,591 --> 03:02:05,879
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't sit there spending $7, $8 trying to unlock every single one of those games, which you can do the same thing for $20, maybe even a little less, and you can find it somewhere on sale or even on eBay or something.

2521
03:02:06,620 --> 03:02:12,125
[SPEAKER_03]: But will the PC game allow me to post how I'm doing in the game so I can show off my EP into the world?

2522
03:02:12,726 --> 03:02:14,908
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not just take a screenshot and do the same thing?

2523
03:02:15,189 --> 03:02:21,215
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, will it let me possibly, if my team score is high enough, win a trip to LA to see a backstage...

2524
03:02:21,980 --> 03:02:23,101
[SPEAKER_03]: Taping or whatever it was called.

2525
03:02:23,121 --> 03:02:25,582
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would you want to do that when you're already near LA as it is?

2526
03:02:25,602 --> 03:02:26,443
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not that close.

2527
03:02:27,884 --> 03:02:31,046
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, apparently I'm not able to fly there as I learned this week.

2528
03:02:32,507 --> 03:02:34,888
[SPEAKER_00]: Burning down planes and everything.

2529
03:02:35,228 --> 03:02:36,529
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just that awesome, I guess.

2530
03:02:36,649 --> 03:02:37,410
[SPEAKER_03]: Burning down the house.

2531
03:02:37,950 --> 03:02:38,811
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2532
03:03:04,250 --> 03:03:14,913
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing with the iTouch versions of Price is Right and Press Your Luck were both also watered down versions of the PC ones.

2533
03:03:14,933 --> 03:03:17,053
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of those iPod games are really horrible.

2534
03:03:17,093 --> 03:03:20,754
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll tell you, I finally was able to upgrade to the iPhone 4 this week.

2535
03:03:20,794 --> 03:03:23,295
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't talk about it earlier in the show because I had other video games to talk about.

2536
03:03:23,335 --> 03:03:27,176
[SPEAKER_03]: But I finally, being the sheep I am, I upgraded to an iPhone 4.

2537
03:03:27,296 --> 03:03:32,997
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the great things about it is that now it has the speed to actually be able to play a lot of the games that are out there for it.

2538
03:03:33,417 --> 03:03:34,898
[SPEAKER_03]: But some of them aren't worth my time.

2539
03:03:35,238 --> 03:03:39,560
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there's a port of Sonic 2 available, which, you know, don't get me wrong.

2540
03:03:39,640 --> 03:03:42,102
[SPEAKER_03]: I love Sonic and Sega makes some great games.

2541
03:03:42,202 --> 03:03:45,303
[SPEAKER_03]: But the frame rate, even on the iPhone 4, is kind of junky.

2542
03:03:45,363 --> 03:03:48,565
[SPEAKER_03]: And just controlling with the touchscreen is kind of crap.

2543
03:03:48,645 --> 03:03:50,946
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it just doesn't make for a good experience.

2544
03:03:51,347 --> 03:03:55,549
[SPEAKER_03]: Not everything in the world has to be on the frigging iPhone, you know.

2545
03:03:56,370 --> 03:03:56,790
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.

2546
03:03:58,794 --> 03:04:06,287
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a big fan of a lot of different games, and a lot of games, when they try to port it over, it was turning into absolute crap.

2547
03:04:06,347 --> 03:04:07,910
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, what did they do with this?

2548
03:04:07,990 --> 03:04:09,393
[SPEAKER_00]: Why did they do this in the first place?

2549
03:04:10,638 --> 03:04:22,869
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really interesting though just how saturated the marketplace has become.

2550
03:04:22,909 --> 03:04:26,913
[SPEAKER_03]: They say it's almost impossible to make money in there now because it's just so, so saturated.

2551
03:04:26,973 --> 03:04:32,678
[SPEAKER_03]: It takes so much for your game to stick out amongst everything that's out there that a lot of people are really struggling.

2552
03:04:33,604 --> 03:04:36,906
[SPEAKER_00]: I totally agree.

2553
03:04:37,026 --> 03:04:39,228
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, nothing against any of these games.

2554
03:04:39,308 --> 03:04:40,309
[SPEAKER_00]: I love Price is Right.

2555
03:04:40,329 --> 03:04:41,029
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that kind of stuff.

2556
03:04:41,049 --> 03:04:46,272
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only reason why I didn't blast it out to everybody on my Facebook page is because I didn't really want everybody to be playing it.

2557
03:04:46,313 --> 03:04:48,374
[SPEAKER_00]: I looked at it, and I'm like, at first, it wasn't even loading.

2558
03:04:48,514 --> 03:04:49,455
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't even loading at first.

2559
03:04:49,495 --> 03:04:51,056
[SPEAKER_00]: It was coming up as a blink screen.

2560
03:04:51,096 --> 03:04:54,978
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they did it, it was like, when I saw it, I'm like, no, I'm not doing this.

2561
03:04:55,419 --> 03:05:01,803
[SPEAKER_03]: To be fair, to play Devil's Advocate just a little bit, the game is still in beta, so it's not going to be perfect.

2562
03:05:01,823 --> 03:05:03,024
[SPEAKER_03]: I just got to throw that out there.

2563
03:05:04,344 --> 03:05:11,466
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, but I'd rather pay my $20 PC game that I bought.

2564
03:05:11,586 --> 03:05:20,067
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess one point you do make, you only get to play so many games of The Price is Right for free, and then if you want more coins, you have to buy them with real money.

2565
03:05:20,467 --> 03:05:22,448
[SPEAKER_03]: So I totally get your point.

2566
03:05:22,508 --> 03:05:26,789
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't spend real money on this game if you could just plop down $20 and get a superior game.

2567
03:05:26,989 --> 03:05:28,089
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll agree with that.

2568
03:05:28,849 --> 03:05:30,490
[SPEAKER_00]: or even cheaper depending on where you buy it from.

2569
03:05:30,530 --> 03:05:33,711
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've seen it even on sale as low as $10 depending on what place it's from.

2570
03:05:33,811 --> 03:05:34,751
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, yes.

2571
03:05:34,911 --> 03:05:38,212
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, like I said before, it's worth the wait.

2572
03:05:38,272 --> 03:05:40,153
[SPEAKER_00]: And the games are really good.

2573
03:05:40,213 --> 03:05:41,973
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they did a really good job with Press Your Luck.

2574
03:05:42,413 --> 03:05:43,294
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it for the PC.

2575
03:05:43,334 --> 03:05:44,254
[SPEAKER_00]: I play it all the time.

2576
03:05:44,334 --> 03:05:47,615
[SPEAKER_00]: I love how there's 17 different episodes you can go through and unlock different stuff.

2577
03:05:48,195 --> 03:05:53,696
[SPEAKER_00]: But as for the other versions, other than maybe that and the Wii, it was crap.

2578
03:05:53,916 --> 03:05:57,177
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like they just threw it out there without even knowing what was going on.

2579
03:05:57,677 --> 03:06:11,200
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would love to see the PlayStation version have like avatar support, but unfortunately, like I said before, the reason it didn't is because of the fact that it was a bad replica of the port basically from that of the PC or the Wii.

2580
03:06:12,617 --> 03:06:18,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well anything I gotta wrap up here, anything else you wanna talk to our listeners about tonight, real quick?

2581
03:06:18,158 --> 03:06:40,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Nah, that's pretty much it, that's all I know to say, that and the fact at this point that Civ 4 demo won't be coming out to the day of, but Civ 5, but yes, it's not coming out to the day of I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I was I've been so behind you myself There's too many damn games to keep track of these days, it's alright Alright, well thank you for the call my friend really appreciate it, have a wonderful week and stay black You too, 5,000 What'd he say at the end there?

2582
03:06:41,586 --> 03:06:42,187
[SPEAKER_03]: I missed that.

2583
03:06:42,347 --> 03:06:42,987
[SPEAKER_03]: I missed it too.

2584
03:06:43,448 --> 03:06:46,930
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope it wasn't another plain joke because, yeah, they frown on those.

2585
03:06:47,370 --> 03:06:49,151
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, that's it for the Skype line tonight.

2586
03:06:49,452 --> 03:06:50,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you guys so much for calling.

2587
03:06:50,712 --> 03:06:51,353
[SPEAKER_03]: We appreciate it.

2588
03:06:51,373 --> 03:06:54,395
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry if you didn't get through, but please, you can always send us an email, a tweet.

2589
03:06:54,495 --> 03:06:55,476
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not too much to ask.

2590
03:06:56,336 --> 03:06:57,057
[SPEAKER_03]: 140 characters or less.

2591
03:06:58,072 --> 03:07:00,534
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, any stories you want to get out here before we finish?

2592
03:07:01,194 --> 03:07:05,097
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I was just checking that right now to see if there was anything we didn't talk about.

2593
03:07:05,237 --> 03:07:07,859
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what, Tigerclaw's throwing one out in chat I'll mention real quick.

2594
03:07:08,000 --> 03:07:12,503
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember hearing this either unless Matt had just covered it before in the last one.

2595
03:07:13,063 --> 03:07:14,505
[SPEAKER_03]: There's an Epic Mickey Collector's Edition.

2596
03:07:14,565 --> 03:07:15,085
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you mention that?

2597
03:07:15,345 --> 03:07:17,266
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I didn't mention that, but whatever

2598
03:07:38,252 --> 03:07:44,157
[SPEAKER_11]: They had also a new collector's edition for Dead Rising 2 where you can actually get it from Capcom.

2599
03:07:44,537 --> 03:07:48,380
[SPEAKER_11]: It comes with a bunch of poker chips and custom poker cards and stuff like that.

2600
03:07:48,760 --> 03:07:54,204
[SPEAKER_11]: And then also a chance to win a six foot tall life-size statue of a zombie.

2601
03:07:55,685 --> 03:07:56,386
[SPEAKER_11]: But that's only, you know...

2602
03:07:57,282 --> 03:08:01,024
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought at first, before I actually read the article, that it was every single package.

2603
03:08:01,044 --> 03:08:02,625
[SPEAKER_11]: I was like, oh, gonna buy that instantly.

2604
03:08:02,805 --> 03:08:06,307
[SPEAKER_11]: But obviously that would be way too expensive.

2605
03:08:06,847 --> 03:08:09,669
[SPEAKER_11]: But that's something that they're gonna be giving away.

2606
03:08:11,310 --> 03:08:11,870
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see.

2607
03:08:12,030 --> 03:08:14,752
[SPEAKER_11]: Stuff that maybe we didn't talk about.

2608
03:08:18,794 --> 03:08:19,114
[SPEAKER_11]: Ah, yes.

2609
03:08:19,814 --> 03:08:23,476
[SPEAKER_11]: Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep is not coming to the PlayStation Network.

2610
03:08:23,516 --> 03:08:26,378
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you own a PSP Go, you ain't playing that game.

2611
03:08:28,120 --> 03:08:30,216
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you Square Enix Um

2612
03:08:32,011 --> 03:08:33,691
[SPEAKER_11]: See, we talked a little bit about Angry Birds.

2613
03:08:35,032 --> 03:08:39,113
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess the devs working with Hollywood Advisors on a possible movie pitch.

2614
03:08:39,833 --> 03:08:42,494
[SPEAKER_11]: They will probably accept it because they're desperate for stuff.

2615
03:08:44,874 --> 03:08:48,315
[SPEAKER_11]: The full track list for DJ Hero 2 got released.

2616
03:08:48,375 --> 03:08:52,116
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, by track list, it means the songs that they will be using in the mixes.

2617
03:08:52,917 --> 03:08:54,377
[SPEAKER_11]: Some cool stuff, though, I actually like.

2618
03:08:54,677 --> 03:08:58,418
[SPEAKER_11]: It was funny, one of the songs I was actually almost going to pick for a Cage Mackenzie.

2619
03:08:58,738 --> 03:09:15,079
[SPEAKER_11]: and still might pick the Prodigy Omen off their new album is on there and of course the classic Firestarter is part of that as well some new Tiesto tracks on there Speed Rail I Will Be Here and Come On

2620
03:09:17,202 --> 03:09:19,264
[SPEAKER_11]: lots of Lady Gaga, actually.

2621
03:09:19,705 --> 03:09:24,770
[SPEAKER_11]: They're going to have Love Game, Bad Romance, and Just Dance in there as well.

2622
03:09:25,070 --> 03:09:28,173
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, Connie West, Love Lockdown, and Heartless.

2623
03:09:29,374 --> 03:09:34,540
[SPEAKER_11]: And then they've got some random old school stuff in there, like they have...

2624
03:09:37,143 --> 03:09:41,028
[SPEAKER_11]: Janet Jackson, Axl F, Gorillaz, Stylo, Donna Summers, Bad Girls,

2625
03:09:58,566 --> 03:10:00,607
[SPEAKER_11]: New Order's Blue Monday is going to be in there.

2626
03:10:01,888 --> 03:10:03,069
[SPEAKER_11]: Orbital with the box.

2627
03:10:03,589 --> 03:10:05,050
[SPEAKER_11]: That's pretty awesome they have Orbital in there.

2628
03:10:05,331 --> 03:10:06,331
[SPEAKER_11]: Salt and Pepper's Push It.

2629
03:10:07,332 --> 03:10:13,597
[SPEAKER_11]: And then it's kind of cool Justice is going to be in there as well with D.A.N.C.E.

2630
03:10:13,757 --> 03:10:15,178
[SPEAKER_11]: and also Waters of Nazareth.

2631
03:10:15,558 --> 03:10:18,800
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't remember Waters of Nazareth but I did put in D.A.N.C.E.

2632
03:10:19,081 --> 03:10:20,522
[SPEAKER_11]: in Cage Match so that's kind of cool.

2633
03:10:21,062 --> 03:10:22,143
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, lots of cool stuff.

2634
03:10:22,523 --> 03:10:25,165
[SPEAKER_11]: Only one Daft Punk song, so that's a little depressing.

2635
03:10:25,305 --> 03:10:26,325
[SPEAKER_11]: Human After All is in there.

2636
03:10:27,886 --> 03:10:30,348
[SPEAKER_11]: Basement Jackson, Where's Your Head At?

2637
03:10:31,689 --> 03:10:32,569
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, lots of cool stuff.

2638
03:10:32,729 --> 03:10:33,770
[SPEAKER_11]: Very excited about it.

2639
03:10:34,030 --> 03:10:45,197
[SPEAKER_11]: In fact, actually, they have a Facebook app that you can check out that's a contest where you're supposed to guess what the mashups are, and they're kind of giving you a little bit of a preview of some of the songs that are actually going to be in the game, the sets and stuff.

2640
03:10:45,217 --> 03:10:46,357
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's kind of neat.

2641
03:10:46,377 --> 03:10:46,998
[SPEAKER_11]: So check that out.

2642
03:10:47,578 --> 03:10:52,561
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, I wonder if there's any standalone songs, because there were a few of those in year one, like Herbie Hancock.

2643
03:10:52,581 --> 03:10:57,884
[SPEAKER_11]: There might be some beat juggles or whatever, so that could be cool.

2644
03:10:59,605 --> 03:10:59,946
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

2645
03:11:02,027 --> 03:11:02,367
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

2646
03:11:03,448 --> 03:11:09,471
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well if that's it for Last Minute Stories, then I guess it's time to go around and get everybody's final thought.

2647
03:11:09,912 --> 03:11:11,132
[SPEAKER_03]: It's time to end another show.

2648
03:11:11,232 --> 03:11:11,953
[SPEAKER_03]: Boo hoo, sad.

2649
03:11:13,274 --> 03:11:14,134
[SPEAKER_03]: Final thoughts tonight.

2650
03:11:14,174 --> 03:11:16,015
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakra, what's your final thought tonight?

2651
03:11:16,276 --> 03:11:16,976
[SPEAKER_03]: My arms hurt.

2652
03:11:17,523 --> 03:11:18,144
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry to hear that.

2653
03:11:18,624 --> 03:11:19,785
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, you have a final thought tonight?

2654
03:11:20,425 --> 03:11:21,466
[SPEAKER_11]: One last thing I was going to say.

2655
03:11:21,646 --> 03:11:26,310
[SPEAKER_11]: Portal is also going to become part of the syllabus at apparently Wabash College.

2656
03:11:27,631 --> 03:11:30,834
[SPEAKER_11]: It's actually, you know, I don't think you have to read it, but obviously play it.

2657
03:11:31,795 --> 03:11:32,575
[SPEAKER_03]: Heck of a final thought.

2658
03:11:32,896 --> 03:11:40,682
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, but no, my final thought is I have a headache from lack of sleep and I don't anticipate it going away and that sucks.

2659
03:11:41,980 --> 03:11:45,421
[SPEAKER_03]: My final thought is, back to work tomorrow, back to the real world.

2660
03:11:45,481 --> 03:11:47,222
[SPEAKER_03]: Boo-hoo, cry, sob.

2661
03:11:47,262 --> 03:11:48,603
[SPEAKER_03]: But hey, three-day weekend coming up.
