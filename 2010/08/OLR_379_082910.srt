00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,640
tonight, August 29th, 2010, could Sony soon adopt the controversial online pass, two retail

00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,640
chains jump in the used video game market, and an upcoming MMO plans to penalize players

3
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:33,800
that play too much. Orange Lounge Radio. Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome

4
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:39,680
to another week of Orange Lounge Radio, the video game show where every gamer has a voice.

5
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:45,800
We do tape live every Sunday night at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, 6 o'clock pacific,

6
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,880
9 o'clock eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show. My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be

7
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:54,780
joining over the next few hours with my awesome co-hosts, always here every week, say hello

8
00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:00,160
to the one and only, Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers. I hope I'm always here, it's my house. Well,

9
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,400
there have been times where you haven't been here, and those are the awkward shows. The

10
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:08,240
awkward shows where Dan's like, are they gonna run off with the vault? Well, there's also

11
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:13,360
been about, you know, six different studios in OLR's history, we tend to bounce around

12
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,680
like a, I don't know, homeless college kid. This one's my favorite. Well, of course, yeah,

13
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,240
cause you just have to roll out of bed and into the studio, this is my least favorite

14
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,880
cause I have to drive out here. At least I like you. Alright. I liked your garage too.

15
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:32,120
It was nice. It was hot. Yes. Alright, also say hello to Tech Master Loki. Hello. We used

16
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:36,200
to tape the show at his house too, when it was my house too. Yes. Remember that? Years

17
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:41,160
ago. Yes. Years ago. I was like probably the second place we ever did the show. That was,

18
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:47,480
imagine if OLR was your life. That was pretty much that apartment. Good times, good times.

19
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:52,960
How have you been doing, Loki? How's the baby? How's life? Um, fine. Just, you know, I don't

20
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:58,040
get a lot of sleep. Of course, that's what they say. Yep, so. You seem to be doing okay

21
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:01,920
though. You seem to be awake enough, but if you don't... Well, I can thank, you know,

22
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:08,600
playing Final Fantasy XI for early hours in the morning, you know, to thank for that since,

23
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:13,520
you know, that kind of got me accustomed to, you know, being able to operate without that

24
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,320
much sleep. Well, if you nod off during the show, we'll know what's going on, right? Yeah,

25
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:25,320
you're boring me. Well, let's hope not. We also have our chat room to gauge us. Chat.orangeloungeradio.com,

26
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:29,280
the always present fourth guest on the show, especially when there isn't actually a fourth

27
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,600
guest here in studio tonight, as there is not tonight. It's the first show in a while

28
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,800
that I can remember where it's just the three of us. Doing it the way we've done it for

29
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,540
many, many years now. Anyhow, we're going to get into gaming news, but we always like

30
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:45,400
to start off the show with a little bit of, how was your gaming week? So, how was your

31
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:51,040
gaming week, DarkSakura? Um, it was fairly old school. I don't know if the pile of Master

32
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,280
System games is still out in the front room, because I've gotten used to it out there,

33
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:02,280
but Dan was playing some Alex Kidd in Shinobi World and Zillion, a lot of Zillion, and we

34
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,200
played a couple things together. What ever happened to the Alex Kidd games? It kind of

35
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,720
disappeared. He did them on Genesis. I remember when I was growing up, I sort of saw Alex

36
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,960
Kidd as sort of like Sega's Mario, because keep in mind, Sonic didn't show up until the

37
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:21,680
Genesis. But Sega got Sonic and that went away. And then they had a Master System version

38
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:27,920
of Sonic. That only came out in Brazil. And that was also after the Genesis version was

39
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,280
out, because remember Blast Processing was the secret to Sonic, remember that? So there

40
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,240
wasn't, yeah, I mean, yeah, there was a Sonic on the Master System, but it was a little

41
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:40,960
bit, you know, not, it was way after the fact. So I sort of saw, back in the day, Alex Kidd

42
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:46,240
as the Mario on Sega's system. I mean, I don't know, in my young mind, that's kind of what

43
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:51,280
I saw. So it's odd to me that Alex Kidd kind of disappeared, save for the, doesn't he make

44
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,320
cameos in some of the Sega sports games and things like that? That's really it. I think.

45
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:59,000
You know, one game that I forgot that we had that is actually kind of cool, the only reason

46
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:08,120
we really have this is because it was an oddity in printing. We have Monopoly. Wow. As a monopoly,

47
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:14,920
but they actually did M-O-N-O, space, capital P-O-L-Y. Awesome. So we have Monopoly. Monopoly.

48
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:19,400
Nice. And, but Dan didn't actually have the Master System, he was using the power-based

49
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:24,360
converter on the Genesis. And then I played some Star Trek online today. I made an Andorian

50
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:35,240
chick just because. And I really haven't, I was given a game on Steam. And one of our

51
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:40,760
listeners sent me something fantastic. And I put it over here, because I've been waiting

52
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:46,420
for Dan to get off the old school kick so I could play Final Fantasy 13. Thank you.

53
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:52,960
Gave me Rival School's drama album. Wait, from a listener? Yeah. Wow. And it was addressed

54
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:59,240
to Sakura Kasugano. Do you know what listener sent that to you? I'm trying to remember that

55
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:07,480
I've got the box right here, but he didn't put the name on it. It's just his real name.

56
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,360
I don't know who that is, but I know where that city and state is. I know exactly where

57
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:17,600
that is. Yeah. Just outside the big city there. Yeah. Yeah. Interesting. But it's really cool.

58
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:24,040
I love it. And I can understand about half of it. But I mean, I'm a big, I'm a big...

59
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:31,120
This one's actually the first one, the Shiritz Justice Kakuen. So. Wow. I'm pretty happy.

60
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,040
This has been like the year of getting strange packages in the mail from listeners. Because

61
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:38,960
I didn't... Loki, you got like a full freaking Xbox from a listener, didn't you? Yeah, J-Tech

62
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,720
system. And you never figured out who sent that to you? Nope. DarkSakura just... Send

63
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,360
me one!...forgot the guy's online name and doesn't want to say his real name. Yeah, I'm

64
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:56,640
like that. I got... I'm going to say, thank you, Fred. Civ 4 I got from X-Link and I got

65
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:01,960
the same Steam game you did, so. Oh, that was... Okay. Because yeah, I've been meaning

66
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:07,640
to try it out. It's just... I started school last week. Yeah. So, of course, there goes...

67
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:16,280
I play Peggle at Fuddruckers. When they ruin my order! Let me go into our chatroom at chat.orangeslaunceready.com.

68
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:21,720
DarkKisuke is in chat trying to take responsibility for sending it to you, but said JK. Let's

69
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:26,600
see. DarkTetsuya says, I do know what my favorite Sega Master Sister game is. Toss-up between

70
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:31,720
the Ghostbusters port and Astro Warrior. Was the Ghostbusters port on Sega Master System

71
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:36,040
the same one that was on like Commodore 64 and the computers back in the early 80s? Or

72
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:40,760
is that a different Ghostbusters game? Because I love the one that was on Commodore 64. The

73
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:45,160
one that had like... There was the Gatekeeper and the Keymaster and you didn't... When they

74
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:50,320
joined up, the game was over. Unless you had so many points, then you could climb the tower.

75
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:57,280
Ah, forget it. Forget it. Are you the Gatekeeper? So this is the last semester of school for

76
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:02,800
you, right? You graduate this year? Well, not forever the last semester. We've been

77
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,160
in school since the show started. Well, you know why? And I've got to say this. There's

78
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:11,520
nothing wrong with always wanting to enrich the mind. I spent way too much time doing

79
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,280
what everyone else said that I should do instead of doing what I love. And now I just said,

80
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:21,480
fuck it. I'm doing what I love. And I'm going to graduate with my AA. And I'm going to do

81
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:26,000
a year of the rest of my gen ed for... I'm actually kind of thinking of not going to

82
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,100
Sac State, maybe going to UC Davis. You know, it'll be a drive, but I might get a better

83
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:33,560
education out of it. So you'd say the life lesson you learned is that you should go to

84
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:40,560
school to study what you love? Yeah. Can I major in pornography in college? Rob. What?

85
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,400
My point is, is that when you find something that you can make a living out of that you

86
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:52,300
love, go for it. I also love food, but I can't cook. So I'm, I don't know what you can do.

87
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:56,520
You could actually take journalism classes and be a food critic. That's a really, ooh,

88
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:01,080
that's now that's a good idea. And then have like... Aren't all food critics fat? Like

89
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,000
I've never known. I mean, don't take offense if you're a food critic. I've never known

90
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,060
any, but... You can have high metabolism or actually you may be healthy. But they're all

91
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:14,400
pompous asses. At least that's what I've gathered from watching Iron Chef. Actually on Iron

92
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:19,820
Chef America, Julie Chen is a food critic and she's my hero. So I... We should do like

93
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:27,500
a one off side podcast that's called Fat Butt. And talk about all the food we love that makes

94
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:33,320
our butts fat. That's what Alan calls me actually. So I could be the host, Fat Butt. He shouldn't

95
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:38,660
call you Fat Bump. He should call you Plus Booty. I'm not going to get into it. Actually

96
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:45,500
my nickname is Fat Kitty. I'm just going to get into that. I'm going to get a text message

97
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:53,560
in five, four, three, stop talking! Alright, anyhow. If that's it for Dark Soccer's gaming

98
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:58,320
week, Loki, how was your gaming week? It was okay. Didn't really play a lot except for

99
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:03,920
on Friday where we did this kind of company sales team building thing where we went to

100
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:11,720
Dave and Buster's and played some games. The whole team building portion of that event

101
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:18,320
was kind of dumb because they have this arcade full of wonderful games and they put you on

102
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,640
all the really crappy games. Except for say, Rallying Classic, which is better known as

103
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:30,640
Daytona sans license. And that was fun. But the person, they had us split up in the groups

104
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:36,400
and stuff of four. So we were all teams of four. And the guy that was in charge of our

105
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:42,600
three teams of four was an idiot. And instead of putting three people up each round to have

106
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:48,020
them go head to head against each team, they just had each team compete against themselves.

107
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:54,480
And because of that and his horrible score keeping, we ended up near last place because

108
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,000
he was a clean idiot. Not that it matters because it was just for fun, but whatever.

109
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,760
It's still a waste of time. I did though play some arcade games. I got to play the Rambo

110
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:08,880
shooting game, which is kind of funny. They had that at Golf Land too. Did you play the

111
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,600
Terminator one? Because that one's actually really fun. No, I did walk past it a bunch

112
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,600
of times and that looked really cool. And it's hard! But I just didn't get a chance

113
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:22,920
to do that. There's so many pretty games there. But I actually played some DDR. I played DDRX.

114
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:30,180
And I, because I wasn't really familiar with the machine, I got stuck doing singles beginner.

115
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:36,240
Like one credit. And it was really annoying. And it was really strange. And I don't know

116
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,600
if the timing's different on beginner mode or something like that. But for some reason

117
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:44,640
I did horribly in beginner mode. But then when I actually played normal games and even

118
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:51,960
on doubles and stuff I did a lot better. How that works is beyond me, but that's what happened.

119
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:56,780
So I played some doubles on that. I don't really care for the new stage that they have.

120
00:10:56,780 --> 00:11:02,320
It looks really cheap because it's all one single sheet of metal that they have in there

121
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,520
instead of all the little panels, which are really cool looking. But yeah, whatever. And

122
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:16,400
the spacing's a little different. But that's minor. Let's see, what else? I played a game

123
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:22,200
called Tank Tank Tank, which is kind of fun. Which mission did you do? Did you do the giant

124
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:28,400
monster mission? Well we just played versus, so. Ah, no. Next time you play that you have

125
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:34,680
to do co-op and play against the giant bees. And the giant squid. And then the building

126
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,960
mecha. But you were telling me about this game. This game is so much fun! It's tank

127
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:44,840
versus bees. That's strange. Well, you can either choose versus or two tanks versus two

128
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:51,400
other tanks. Or you can go against the evil robot hordes. And so you get these big missiles

129
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:55,760
with granny faces on them. They're so fantastic. These are pretty fucking terrible. I call

130
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:00,960
them mecha bees. Tank Tank Tank was pretty fun. And there was some other game that we

131
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:05,040
played. It was kind of like Trackmania, the arcade game almost. And that was alright.

132
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:14,240
What else did I play there? That was about it. I just played a lot of DDR. I'm not very

133
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:21,200
in shape anymore. And it's been a while since I played DDR. But I actually did play A on

134
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:28,680
doubles on, I guess it's called Expert now, which is like an 11 footer. And I passed it,

135
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:34,320
oh my god, I felt like crap afterwards. Of course, now that I think of it, I don't think

136
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,040
there's ever been a time that I played A on doubles on heavy or whatever that I actually

137
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:42,360
didn't feel like crap afterwards. So that's fine. Did you go right into playing a hard

138
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:49,120
song? Well no, that was my last song. I actually played... Still, just in one game, you played,

139
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:57,360
you know, wow. You ever heard of a warm up? I did play warm up stuff. I did, it was really

140
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:02,680
tiring me out though because I'm not used to it anymore. So I was playing, you know,

141
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:06,000
some of the new songs that were in there were kind of dumb, so I didn't really care for

142
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:14,640
the new DDRX songs, I guess. I played, actually a few times I played Hysteria because I liked

143
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:21,040
one of the patterns for, I guess it was the, I don't even know what they call it now, the

144
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:25,160
second setting. It would have been Trick, I don't remember. Yeah, they changed them

145
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:29,720
all just to change them. It's just annoying. Whatever. Red difficulty, right? Yes, the

146
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:35,560
medium difficulty. I liked the double pattern for that, so that was fun. And then I was

147
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:41,600
trying to remember like, I remember there was, you know, 20 November I know if you play

148
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:46,560
that on I think heavy and little that like makes no notes for like quite a while, that

149
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:55,920
would have been fun. Also, there's another one that was like that. Anyway, so played

150
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:00,640
a few rounds of that and that was fun. And then of course, you know, Redemption stuff

151
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:07,640
played some Deal or No Deal because, I mean, that game was super easy. But yeah, so now

152
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:11,920
it was funny because I had a bunch of Dave and Buster power cards from like back when

153
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:16,680
we went to our first E3, like when we went to Irvine, you know, and went to that Dave

154
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:20,560
and Buster's. I had a card from that. I had one. Wow, that was a long time ago. I had

155
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:26,920
one from when we went to Milpitas one time and then so I combined that together with

156
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:31,920
one that they gave us to use during this competition. Then I got another one from them later on.

157
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:36,960
So I have like a bunch of credits at Dave and Buster's right now. I just haven't gotten

158
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:40,700
a chance to use them. But it's not bad. It's a small one compared to the other ones. They

159
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:45,080
even said, though, like because the people are reps at Dave and Buster's, they said it's

160
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:49,320
one of the, I think it's the smallest one that they have. Which is kind of lame, but

161
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:53,400
whatever. It's nice to at least have one. They should put another one in Folsom, though.

162
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:57,600
I definitely agree that because there's nothing in Folsom. And it's kind of weird that they

163
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,800
put Dave and Buster's like right next to Golf Land and right down the street from, you know,

164
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,680
John's Incredible Pizza. You know, all these different like fun land places. It's weird.

165
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:10,320
They're right there. And then of course, other than that, Grand Theft Auto, Lost in Damned

166
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,600
has been playing a lot more of that. And that's still fun. Working on mod stuff. It's kind

167
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:19,000
of annoying, though, because the, I'm sure not a lot of people are familiar with the

168
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:26,080
Grand Theft Auto console modding community. But they're very, I don't know, very, I don't

169
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:33,520
know what the word would be for it. They're dicks, I guess. It's because they figure out

170
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:38,080
something and then they kind of hold it above everybody's head. Well, I figured out something,

171
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:43,120
so I posted about it because, you know, it's it's kind of cool. I thought I'd share something.

172
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,160
And so now they're saying, oh, well, we're going to, you know, we did the same thing

173
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,760
and and, you know, we're not going to tell you guys how to do it until a while from now.

174
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:54,760
So I posted in that same thread how to do it. And they went and deleted my post. I'm

175
00:15:54,760 --> 00:16:01,640
like, you motherfuckers. So I got to release something. Wait, what is this? It's modding

176
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:06,560
the game. I know how to I figured out how to change the maps and actually I figured

177
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:11,320
out how to change work. Different cars spawn and stuff like that. It's all your own website.

178
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:16,720
It's all within the law. I don't even give a crap. I just I'm OK. You just I do post

179
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,560
an Orange Lounge radio story. It's really easy. I'll send you the PDF the deep man made.

180
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,360
You post a new story to orange launch radio dot com. Title of story. What's the name of

181
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:31,320
this website? The Seven Sins Fuck Seven Sins and then post the your your acts and all.

182
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:35,800
It's there's it's like high school drama. It's so it's probably a bunch of high school

183
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:42,240
or it's sad. It's really sad. But it the only thing I have a problem with, though, is someone

184
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,840
claiming credit to something that I figured out a long time ago. And there's even a post

185
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:49,760
that's like weeks old that's on that damn website. But, you know, of course, it's a

186
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:53,320
few pages back. So people don't realize it. Would you would you like to give out a hack

187
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:58,080
right now? So you you have patent pending? No, I already I already have a YouTube video

188
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:03,160
out there of it. And so I'm all set. I've got my bases covered. But it's just that,

189
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:08,240
you know, these days, Loki has dibs. It's just like they sent me a private message that

190
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:14,800
says, don't worry, we'll give you you know, we're crediting you for indirectly, you know,

191
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:18,920
coming up with this idea. I'm like indirectly. I directly came up with this fucking idea.

192
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:25,200
Stupid indirectly inspired you to come up with this idea. Basically, I walked you through

193
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:32,520
it. Whatever this guys sound. It's dumb. I don't mean to be little kids, you know, whatever.

194
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:39,400
It's just it's it's frustrating. I don't really care that, you know, I just have problems

195
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:43,840
people taking credit for something I came up with. The whole point was I was just trying

196
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:48,040
to give them an idea because all the stuff that they have out there right now, hacks

197
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:52,640
is just people editing like the lines for the handling of the cars and stuff like that.

198
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,360
So, oh, look, this car is fast. Oh, look, this car, you know, crashes through things.

199
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:01,120
Oh, this one flies. Big fucking whoop. All right. I got I got to take a sidetrack here

200
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,480
to read some of the chat comments because they've been accumulating here. Spazinator

201
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,760
PSN is talking about that tank, tank, tank game. Says when you beat tank, tank, tank

202
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:17,200
and watch the credits, it says tanks for playing. Yep. Get it? See, remember earlier I was talking

203
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:22,440
about food and porn and all that and what we should major in in school. Satellite Minded

204
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:27,040
in Chat says Rob should combine food and porn and make a living from that. And Rama follows

205
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:31,880
that up with a website called www dot food porn daily dot com, which I'd never heard

206
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:37,040
of. But, yeah, I'm all you do is you click on pictures of food like this one is mac and

207
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:43,440
cheese with bacon and chicken. Mm hmm. Then I click it again. Mm hmm. Pork chops with

208
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:51,840
parsley. Yum. And it's still food porn. Mm hmm. Salmon sliders. What about this is why

209
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:58,840
you're fat. A lot of that stuff makes me ill. But this this is this is like classy porn.

210
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:09,380
Like this is more like this is the difference between an escort. Yes. And, uh, 20 buck prostitute.

211
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:14,760
This is like Cinemax right here. The food porn daily is like Cinemax. And this is why

212
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:18,600
you're fat dot com is like hustler. That's that's basically the difference between the

213
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:24,040
two. There you go. All right. Anyhow, anything else for your gaming week, Loki? Sorry. No,

214
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:31,540
that's really it. I'm just glad, though, my dev kids coming next week. So, uh, I'm excited

215
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:35,080
to see you how that kind of works out for you. Curious what that well, how that plays

216
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:41,200
or whatever. We'll see. All right. Let's see my gaming week. I've been playing. Oh, fine.

217
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:47,180
Not my gaming. It's just a story real quick. And it's funny. Yes. I experienced on my way

218
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:54,560
over to the show today what I would consider white trash karaoke. Literally, my neighbor

219
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:58,360
across the street. I don't know if they dug out a karaoke machine or whatever, but there

220
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:03,800
was some really obnoxious loud music blaring from their garage. I thought it was like a

221
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:09,000
country western band or something practicing. No, it's this fat chick out there just saying

222
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,840
some really horrible song. Please tell me she's singing like, you know, cash or something.

223
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:20,520
No, wake up in the morning feeling like today. It's like some country western song. God.

224
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:26,400
But it was awful. I'm like, why would you blast that? Seriously? I thought they were

225
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:31,280
having like a party or something, but no, it's just this one one chick apparently wanting

226
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:36,360
to annoy the wants to be famous. Um, let's see. Well, I actually will start off. I have

227
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:40,480
a completely like doesn't have anything to do a gaming story, but I had a very strange

228
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:45,040
weekend. Okay. Um, I was actually supposed to be going to L.A. this weekend, but I didn't

229
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:49,720
end up going. And part of the reason why I didn't end up going is that I was scheduled

230
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:54,120
to take a flight on JetBlue from Sacramento to Long Beach because that's, you know, probably

231
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:57,540
one of the easiest ways to get to L.A. And JetBlue is a fine airline. You can watch TV

232
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:01,760
in the back seats and everything. Um, so we get to the airport, we're sitting there waiting

233
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:07,680
for our flight to go and suddenly they come on the intercom and say, um, well, uh, your

234
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:13,560
plane had to do a evacuate. There was an emergency. The brakes caught fire and, uh, they, and

235
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:17,080
sure enough, we're looking out the window and there's this plane sitting there on the

236
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:21,040
runway and the slides are all inflated and all these people are standing out kind of

237
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:25,640
looking. And yeah, if you heard about that, cause it was kind of a big deal. It was on

238
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:29,720
like CNN and stuff. Yeah. I was supposed to be on that plane. So I was sitting there in

239
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:34,640
the terminal while that plane was landing, waiting to board it. Uh, so yeah, that was

240
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:39,120
kind of a day ruiner. We tried to catch another flight that was seven hours later in Oakland,

241
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,480
but we were like, okay, well at least we'll still get to go to L.A. at some point. And

242
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:47,040
then, uh, yeah, that flight ended up getting delayed for about three and a half hours cause

243
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,960
the whole system was backed up. And that's about the point where we said fuck it because

244
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:54,000
a, we could have just driven there faster. B, we were going to lose our rental car and

245
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,640
all this other stuff and it was kind of annoying. So, uh, kind of a bummer. But yeah, just a

246
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,680
completely random story cause you know, it's, it's not every day that you're sitting right

247
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,960
in front of national news unfolding before your eyes. But one kind of cool thing that

248
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:10,520
did happen, I was posting about it on Twitter and uh, one of my friends actually took pictures

249
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:16,440
of the whole thing unfolding and uh, the associated press contacted us cause they saw me on Twitter

250
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:22,200
and actually bought her picture to use on their story. That's pretty cool. Yeah. How

251
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:27,880
much did they pay her? $75. Oh, she should have. She was thinking she probably could

252
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:32,680
have gotten more, but at the same time when you're, you don't like at a moment like that,

253
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:36,400
you're not thinking like, Oh, I want to take a picture so I can sell it. You know, and

254
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,680
it was more one of those, I think it was more of a novelty thing, right? Like how many people

255
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:43,160
can say they've sold the pictures of the associated price, right? You know, not every, that, that's

256
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:47,480
not an everyday occurrence. So, you know, I think she did it more for the novelty of

257
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:50,520
it than for the actual money. And I can't say I blame her. I would have done the same

258
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:55,140
thing. I took pictures too on Twitter. It's just that iPhone pictures don't have nearly

259
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:58,560
the detail that she actually took them on a real camera. That's why they wanted her

260
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:05,360
pictures cause not a lot of people had that. So yeah, kind of a weird weekend. So, um,

261
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:09,600
let's see. Monty Boggs in our chat room says stuff like that happens in airlines bitch

262
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:14,480
about how not enough people are flying. You know what though? Not to get too far off topic

263
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,640
of the topic of games, except that I was supposed to be playing a bunch of them this weekend

264
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:23,000
and didn't get to because of this. Um, Monty Boggs, the thing is though that every time

265
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,380
something like this happens, like, okay, the SAC airport is not that big of an airport,

266
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:31,900
but this was, I'm sure on the news wherever it is you live. I know this was on the news

267
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:37,960
in like Connecticut. It was on CNN. It was on MSNBC. Nobody died. Nobody was severely

268
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:42,360
hurt. Like a few people were taken to the hospital, but it's because a lot of whiplash

269
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:46,780
type conditions because of the breaking of the plane. And apparently people got rug burns

270
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:50,900
from sliding down those inflatable slides. And those are the injuries that people had.

271
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:56,540
So it's unfortunate and it sucks, but I've seen car accidents that were tons worse, you

272
00:23:56,540 --> 00:24:01,180
know, and you don't hear about every single car accident. So I still think flying is pretty

273
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:05,700
safe all things considered. I'm just, I'm glad the brakes decided to go when they did

274
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:09,380
and not an hour later cause I would prefer to just have stayed at home all weekend and

275
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:13,500
not be in the hospital in Long Beach being treated for burns cause I had to take a trip

276
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:17,760
down the slide. However, if I did have to go down the slide, I'd at least grab a beer

277
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:24,180
first like that guy did. All right. Beer is great. Let me talk about actual games. I just,

278
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:26,980
I had to talk about that cause national news being right in front of me doesn't happen

279
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:31,860
every day. All right. So, um, games. I've been playing Warcraft, of course, still working

280
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:35,460
on my characters. We're about halfway through Icecrown Citadel, which is cool. And the whole

281
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:40,380
guild's gearing up and it's cool, but Cataclysm really needs to be out like now. Like I'm

282
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:44,540
ready for it. I think we all are. Uh, been playing more Starcraft 2. I've been trying

283
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:48,860
to, just trying to go after some of the achievements a little bit and just playing, kind of playing

284
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:52,580
the campaign a little bit here and there. I'm pressing very slowly through that game,

285
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:56,440
but considering I didn't even want to play it at first, I'm surprisingly having a really

286
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:59,700
good time with that. I do have a couple of new games I want to talk about this week.

287
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:04,660
First off, out on PlayStation Network this week was an adaptation of Pressure Luck. This

288
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:08,100
game has already come out on the PC and the Wii and I think there's an iPhone version

289
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:12,060
as well, but it came out on PlayStation Network this week and it was really the first chance

290
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:16,420
I had to check it out. You know, I have the DVD game from a few years ago, which I believe

291
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:20,300
Jamie actually gave me as a gift a couple years ago. I have that. That's really the

292
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:23,660
only version of the game I have to compare it to, which you can't compare a video game

293
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:30,300
to a DVD game. Sorry. I never really played the Wii game. I've only heard about it. And

294
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:34,740
I've only really heard about the PC game as well. So I haven't really played them. The

295
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:42,580
PlayStation one, it's okay. Like there's some really cool things and then there's some really

296
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:46,860
not so cool things that really detract from it. And some of the cool things what I like

297
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:51,380
is that, you know, they give it the look and feel of Pressure Luck. When the thing starts,

298
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:55,300
you know, it's like, these players are about to play a game that could be the biggest game

299
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:58,460
of their lives as they're about to press the whole spiel they would say in the beginning

300
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:03,740
and it looks like the show and it's really cute. And then when you're actually playing

301
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:07,780
the board sequences, it's a lot of fun. Like, you know, your character's actually going

302
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:11,740
big bucks, big bucks, no whammies, you know, they're actually saying it and then and the

303
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:15,780
whammy animations are actually really well done. That's actually probably the best thing

304
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:19,760
about the adaptation. I saw some on the trailer. Yeah, the whammy there. There's new stuff

305
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,380
like there's you know how they would always be like pop culture tie ins. Like I always

306
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:28,140
remember the little whammy that was like boy George that would sing Do you do you really

307
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:36,100
want to wear me? I don't know why I remember this stuff from when I was like seven. Okay.

308
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:39,820
But now they have like an American Idol whammy and some of these other like pop culture references

309
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:45,500
and that's really cool. But unfortunately, with these really high points, there's also

310
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:53,060
a lot of like clunk. Like, just the interface feels very clunky. The shell around the game

311
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:59,140
itself feels very rushed and just not flashy at all like a game show should be. It feels

312
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:04,800
very Facebook game to me. The avatar designer is very disappointing, especially considering

313
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:09,100
that you're playing on a PlayStation. Why can't you just bring in my avatar from home?

314
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:13,660
You know, has this whole system built into it and maybe that's a Sony restriction. I

315
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:17,660
don't know. But it seems a little weird that you can't play with your actual avatars. I

316
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:21,260
tried to play the game online could never find a room full of people to play it with

317
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:27,900
so didn't really get to test that. And I think the questions in the game are really weird.

318
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:34,140
Like it's just only like there's no right. You would think if I'm press your luck on

319
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:39,120
the PlayStation three, I would try to ask a lot of pop culture questions or questions

320
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:44,420
geared towards 20 and 30 somethings. But there's just a lot of like weird off the wall ancient

321
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:47,860
history and obscure sports questions that seem to show up in there and it's kind of

322
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:52,660
like what? Did they just go to a trivia book and yank all this shit out? Like I don't know.

323
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:57,580
Probably what they did. And there's a really weird, like the single player mode is like

324
00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:02,980
playing through 16 episodes and your goal is to try and win each episode. But the computer

325
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:07,880
opponents have these different quirks. So yeah, weird. But at the end of the day, the

326
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:12,500
game is only $10. So here's my thought. If you're bringing people over and you want to

327
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:16,820
have laughs and you have three controllers and you want to have a fun little night, this

328
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:21,620
makes for a good board game substitute. I don't think there's any substitute for an

329
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:25,260
awesome board game like clue or monopoly or catan or something like that. But this is

330
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:28,960
a fun little alternative. You know, I don't think it's anything I would take too seriously

331
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:34,100
beyond that. That's, that's basically it for pressure luck. Another game I've been playing

332
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:37,960
this week is Laura Croft and the Guardian of light, which is one of the new games that's

333
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:42,820
on Xbox 360. And I just want to give disclosure a front here. A friend of mine actually worked

334
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:45,740
on this game. So you may want to take what I'm about to say with a grain of salt, but

335
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:50,620
I assure you that bears nothing on my opinion of this game. And if I may say so, it was

336
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:55,460
covered in last month's retro gamer. Was it? But it's not a retro game. It just came out

337
00:28:55,460 --> 00:29:00,100
this week. Oh, it must be because of the tomb Raider history or whatever, maybe. And, and

338
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:05,060
there is a certain kind of like retro ish feeling about this game. But, um, as far as

339
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:08,380
the game goes, you know, I still, I, I paid the 15 bucks for it. I played through the

340
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:15,300
demo and, uh, I gotta say it is awesome. I think it is one of the better Xbox live arcade

341
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:19,300
games to come out in a long time. It, here's the thing. It doesn't really feel like tomb

342
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:22,420
Raider at all to me. And I think that's why they're not calling it tomb Raider. They're

343
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:26,660
calling it this Laura Croft game, but I would honestly call it like gauntlet legends is

344
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:31,860
what it feels like more to me. It's more of, and it's very arcade feely with the score

345
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:36,660
and you know, kind of the, the way the maps are in the isometric, but it's, it's, um,

346
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:40,740
it's a good time. Uh, I played through with Alan for about three hours on Friday night.

347
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:45,260
We were just kind of going through the different levels and the, the co-op is a lot of fun.

348
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:49,260
Like some of the puzzles are really cool. Like there's all these different mechanics.

349
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:54,980
Like one of you plays as Laura Croft and she has a grappling hook that she can grab, um,

350
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:59,900
like little, um, I dunno, like little chains with, she can grab them and then grapple over

351
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:05,700
to them. And then, um, you can also play as Totek who is like a, um, Aztec warrior and

352
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:11,100
he can use a shield to either block projectiles or he can use the shield and hold it up. And

353
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:16,620
then Laura can jump on his shield or he can throw spears that then Laura can jump on.

354
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:21,240
So you really have to work together in order to be able to solve these different puzzles.

355
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:26,020
And it actually made for a lot of fun. Um, and we were kind of, you know, every level

356
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:30,140
in that game, it seems to end with this big climactic scene. Like for instance, the end

357
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:33,620
of the first level, you think you're at the end and then all of a sudden the walls start

358
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:38,260
to move and they, they start to move in and it's going to push you over into the pit of

359
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:42,060
spikes if you don't think quickly and you really have to work together. Like you have

360
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:47,300
to jump up, then you have to have Totek throw a spear. You jump on the spear, jump up, use

361
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:51,540
your grappling hook to grab Totek, bring him up. I mean, it's, it sounds complicated the

362
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:55,220
way I'm saying it, but it's, it's all very fluid and, and the way it plays out, it, it

363
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:58,980
executes a lot of fun. And you know, Alan and I are kind of yelling back and forth at

364
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:02,660
each other like, no, no, no, do this, do this, this, you know, and we actually fell on the

365
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:05,600
spikes and died one time cause we didn't have it together. But then we, you know, figured

366
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:10,020
it out the next time. That sounds like the most fun type of game. Those are the ones

367
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:13,100
that Dan and I used to play a lot together. And you know what, the co-op puzzles are done

368
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:16,820
really well. So I think, I think like if you have somebody to sit there and play it with

369
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:20,220
you, it's a lot of fun. I mean, here's one of the drawbacks to Lara Croft and it was

370
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:25,220
in the news because they didn't finish co-op on time or it's not, or buggy or I don't know

371
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:29,180
what happened, but the online co-op isn't there and it's not going to be out till the

372
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:35,420
PlayStation 3 version is out. I don't know the rhyme or reason for that, but honestly

373
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:39,920
I was playing it in house and it was fine and we had a lot of fun. I could see though

374
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:43,060
where it's really lacking, you know, if you had somebody you want to play with, but that'll

375
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:50,300
be fixed in a couple of weeks, I guess. And then the other thing is that, oh, there's

376
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:54,260
something else. There's another drawback I was trying to think of. It seemed like the

377
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:58,420
co-op game is shorter, but I think I just misread some things. So I don't, I don't want

378
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:03,580
to state that right now. I think it is the same length. It just looks weird in the summary.

379
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:07,500
But definitely there's going to be a lot of DLC for the game. But yeah, it's fun.

380
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:11,660
Character models are nice. And single player mode, what they do, they

381
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:15,900
give Laura the spear and then they alter some of the puzzles so that you can still do everything

382
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:20,540
by yourself. And I found myself playing through the first level like seven times this afternoon

383
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:24,580
because there's all these different little mini objectives and one of them is a speed

384
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:28,580
objective. Clear the level as fast as you can. And there are lots of little shortcuts

385
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:33,620
you have to take. One of them is a points objective. Take it slow, kill everything,

386
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:37,980
get all the points, grab the diamonds. So it gives a lot of different reasons to replay

387
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:42,180
the game. So I, I think it's absolutely worth checking out. I think it's one of the better

388
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:46,920
games to come out in a while and makes me excited about Tomb Raider games again, which

389
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:53,100
I never thought I'd say since like 1997. So do you feel all tingly and brand new? I guess

390
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:56,940
so, but I guess they're reinvigorating the regular franchise too. And if it's anything

391
00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:00,740
like this, it's going to be awesome. So yeah, I'm, I'm a big fan of Laura Croft and the

392
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:04,020
Guardian of Light. Definitely check out the demo if nothing else. Demo is the first level

393
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:08,980
and I'll give you a, give you a feel for the game. Salacious Pop is in chat and actually

394
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:14,300
says that would give home some purpose. Can't have that. That's in reference to the avatars

395
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:20,880
on a PlayStation three. Press your luck. There you go. All right, chat.orangelandtrady.com

396
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,300
if you want to join us in our chat room and give your own comments. Let's get into some

397
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:28,140
housekeeping tonight and then we'll get into some actual gaming news. Housekeeping tonight.

398
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:31,260
We've been talking about a marathon episode. It was brought up last week and we were kind

399
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:34,940
of joking like, should we really do this? We're going to do it. We are going to do a

400
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:40,180
long extended marathon episode of Orange Lounge Radio. It's going to start next week live

401
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:45,740
at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com. It's going to start at two o'clock Pacific, five

402
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:49,740
o'clock Eastern. So it's a little bit earlier than usual. And 10 o'clock in London. That's

403
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:54,380
right. So this also is kind of that those of you overseas that have been wanting to

404
00:33:54,380 --> 00:34:00,660
listen, here's your chance. So we're going to go for two to five with our normal show,

405
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:04,420
quote unquote. And then after that, we're going to just keep going into the wee morning

406
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:07,100
hours. We're going to go into the vault. We're going to need some extensions from the mic

407
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:10,420
so we can actually go into the vault, play some old classic games. We're going to field

408
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:14,660
a lot of comments from our chat room and kind of the listeners. We want to know some discussion

409
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:18,900
topics you want us to talk about during that time. We'll be kind of asking you guys. Low

410
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:21,660
Key, unfortunately, because of, you know, the baby and the wife and everything, he's

411
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:26,140
only going to be here for the quote unquote normal show, the first three hours, but he'll

412
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:33,060
be here and then he will be replaced. Low Key's not replaceable, of course, but we'll

413
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:37,820
have, I'm sure Dan will be here. I know Alan plans on being here and who knows what else

414
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:42,300
is actually going to be here on next Sunday to do that. And we plan on going until at

415
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:48,220
least midnight and Dark Soccer seems to think we can go even later. So we'll see. Dark Soccer,

416
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:54,420
how late do you think our marathon show should go? All right. As late as it can. And um,

417
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:59,820
let's see. Rama says, woohoo, time to alcohol down. We are actually thinking about doing

418
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:04,180
at the top of every hour. It's happy hour somewhere and we'll actually take a drink

419
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:09,100
of whatever country it happens to be happy hour in. So tune in. It's going to be a good

420
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:13,420
time. There you go. All right. Um, I think that's it for housekeeping. I don't have a

421
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:17,420
whole lot else. Add us on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange launch radio. We're also on Twitter,

422
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:21,420
twitter.com slash O L R. Visit our website at orange laundry.com. There's been a few

423
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:26,020
forum posts over the past a few weeks that have been nice and so on. Let's get into some

424
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:30,220
actual gaming news now. Loki, what is going on in the gaming world? Uh, lots of stuff

425
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:36,860
this week. I'm starting off and this kind of a little frustrating for me, um, because

426
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:45,480
I was actually, you know, I had the opportunity to participate in this and uh, unfortunately

427
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:56,100
due to, um, emails being eaten by a spam filter, I missed out. I think I could be wrong though.

428
00:35:56,100 --> 00:36:02,460
Um, but the connect beta is, um, starting right now. Apparently, um, if you are part

429
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:09,840
of the Microsoft connect program, which I am, um, you get, you know, the occasional

430
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:14,400
survey and beta tests announcements and that kind of stuff. Well, they sent out invites

431
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:18,780
to, um, I'm not sure if it's all the members or some of the members, but, uh, people are

432
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:24,340
getting invites to the connect beta, which they would actually send them a connect motion

433
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:29,940
camera as well as some software to test out and the new dashboard update that's going

434
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:35,120
to be coming out this fall. Um, which includes some other cool stuff, including, um, some

435
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:40,380
audio enhancements and stuff like that. So hopefully that means that, um, everybody doesn't

436
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:45,140
sound like a little kid. It's weird. Like when I was using, um, when sometimes when

437
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:49,640
I'm out sick or something, you know, I have to take time off for my wife or the kid or

438
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:54,240
whatever. Um, and I play against my coworkers at work. They sound like little kids over

439
00:36:54,240 --> 00:37:00,580
the mics. Um, even though that's not what they sound like, I'm, you know, in real life.

440
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:06,500
Um, it's just really weird how badly the audio is distorted. So I'm hoping that that actually

441
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:10,180
gets better. Isn't the connect device, doesn't it have a microphone on it too?

442
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:14,260
Um, it does. Yeah, sure. The room noise. So maybe they're doing audio enhancements to

443
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:18,880
kind of better, you know, for the room talking. Like if I'm sitting way back on the couch

444
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,760
and connects all the way in the front of the room, like it, it's got to use a different

445
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:27,000
type of sensory. Yes and no. But the reason why they're doing the upgrade to that is before

446
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:32,200
it's kind of like how our radio station was before on live three 65 or even the podcast,

447
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:37,760
how before we were kind of catering towards, you know, low bandwidth, you know, 64 K type

448
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:43,440
stuff now they're updating that because most people have broadband and that's why I see.

449
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:47,540
Okay. Yeah. More bandwidth to play with. So, Oh, you know, it might also be the closure

450
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:53,460
of original Xbox. Uh, that's, that's possible. Um, because it says basically that the basic

451
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:58,560
codec had originally required just a 64 K connection and it's time for us to move on.

452
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:05,520
Um, especially if we want to think about broadening, um, a crackly headset on top of your head,

453
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:09,880
not what people think about when they're talking about popular entertainment. And you know,

454
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:13,600
I agree the audio quality should be better so that I can actually hear what people are

455
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:19,080
saying. Um, instead of just hearing mumbling, cause that's what I hear a lot of times. Yeah.

456
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:22,000
If you go back and listen to old episodes of orange launch radio, I mean they're out

457
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,500
there, there's information on the forums. Just remember guys, it was a very different

458
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:29,980
show in 2002. If you go listen to it back when it was dial up friendly radio as we used

459
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:35,640
to call it, you know, it was what, 56 K MP3, no, 24 K MP3 pro or something like that. I

460
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:40,640
don't know what it was. It was, the quality was not very hot if you listen to the recordings

461
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:45,020
from back then and you know, the, the quality has come a long way. So I'm, I'm hoping it'll

462
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:50,620
be just as fast of a difference, uh, over Xbox live. Uh, but basically though the beta

463
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:55,920
testers will be getting, I guess, um, uh, connected ventures, connect sports and connect

464
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:00,140
joy ride, uh, beta versions of those as well. And I do believe there's also a beta version

465
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:04,920
of, uh, dance central as well that's being sent out because, um, it's probably the five

466
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:10,560
song demo that's been, um, yeah, I think it's something similar to that. Uh, so that'd be

467
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:14,440
kind of cool. And those are actually supposed to be sent out now. Um, you should have gotten

468
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:19,480
an email letting you know that's going to happen. I, like I said, I didn't realize that

469
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:26,000
I had gotten this invite way back from like on the eighth. Uh, so I just registered the

470
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,360
other day, but I'm crossing my fingers because not everybody that registers gets into it

471
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:35,780
and I've been led into other beta programs. So it would be nice because one, I like getting

472
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:41,600
stuff early and two, I don't want to have to necessarily pay for this. Uh, you know,

473
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:45,800
especially now with the baby and everything, but well, well just in case, Loki, this is

474
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:53,280
for you for missing out. There you go. Thank you for that. You're welcome. Anytime. What

475
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:57,200
are friends for going to our chat room at chat, that orange lounge radio.com. Tiger

476
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:02,080
claw says Microsoft may improve the quality of the voice chat, but still have yet to improve

477
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:06,760
the quality of the people behind the voice. That is true. You will be able to, you will

478
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:11,340
be able to hear all the horrible insults from 12 year olds and high fidelity. Now you can

479
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:18,280
hear F star star K and I star star star F star G and all those wonderful words. No,

480
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:23,480
it'd be awesome though. Cause you know how they have like the really bad, you know, voice

481
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:28,120
dubbing in those like made for TV or not even necessarily made for TV, but how they have

482
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:32,480
the television cable friendly versions of movies and stuff like, you know, the really

483
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:38,840
bad ones where they'll actually like change words to like hotdog or kazoo or some weird

484
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:43,600
ass word. Um, it'd be funny if they had some sort of algorithm to detect what people are

485
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:47,920
saying and to kind of do that on the fly. Ah, I see. Wasn't there a story? I mean, it

486
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:52,480
was some time ago, like a couple of years ago about a patent filed by, I want to say

487
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:56,640
it was Microsoft. It was a long time ago, but I want to say we talked about a story

488
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:00,200
because we had a good laugh at it about that type of technology that it could actually

489
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:03,520
understand the word fuck and it would replace it. And I don't know, like part of me wants

490
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:06,480
to say it came out the next week that it was all a lie. It was a red herring. It was a

491
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,960
joke, but I don't know. I want to say that story was out there for some reason. It was

492
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:13,840
a while ago. It would be funny though. Be interesting if this might be the implementation

493
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:19,640
of such technology. I doubt it. Yeah. Uh, let's see. A shadow runner in our chat says

494
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:24,080
people still have dial up. I thought that died and act def says dial up still exists.

495
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:26,980
Believe it or not. You know, a lot of people are still on that. Mike, my parents are still

496
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:32,180
on dial up. They will not switch. They say it's too expensive and like my phone has faster

497
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:35,280
internet than they get at their house. Something else to consider though, you know, a lot

498
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:39,640
of us are spoiled living in big cities out in the rural areas. Not everybody's wild wired

499
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:43,780
for, um, super fast internet. I mean, I think they have like satellite internet and some

500
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:47,840
other like workarounds. Some people live in the woods where everything is interrupted

501
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:52,920
by trees or something else to consider other countries. Like, you know, do you think some

502
00:41:52,920 --> 00:42:00,200
countries outside of America, Europe, Japan are as wired for, I guess when I say Europe,

503
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:04,960
I mean Britain and in the surrounding countries. I'm don't, don't send your emails saying Europe

504
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:10,400
is not a country. Um, but you know what I mean? Like a lot of these, those areas are

505
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:14,960
regions of us to say are better wired for internet than others. You know what I mean?

506
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:20,480
Yeah. So if Xbox is going to kind of ramp up the, uh, connection you need, they're kind

507
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:25,000
of given the finger to these people. Really? Because you can't really play on Xbox live

508
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:32,560
with dial up. So who cares? But you can play with like a, can't you play with the satellite

509
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:36,520
link, which isn't, it's faster than dial up, but it's definitely not as fast as cable or

510
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:41,920
even DSL. We may have connection issues cause that's just like playing on our, uh, work,

511
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:47,280
you know, network. It's the connection's not very quick and we get a lot of disconnects

512
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:53,280
with because of that, but it still works when it works. Yeah. Rama in our chat says most

513
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:59,160
ISPs are offering cable modem service for 1999. You know what? I, I probably believe

514
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:03,280
you, I probably should help my parents price this, but I kind of secretly think that my

515
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:07,280
mom is just telling my dad it's too expensive cause she knows that if they buy it, he'll

516
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:11,640
be on the internet all the time. But I'm also thinking my mother is starting to learn how

517
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:15,040
to use the internet and use email. So why wouldn't she want faster internet? I don't

518
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:18,600
know. I guess you'll have to ask them. So there you go. Anything else about the connect

519
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:22,160
program? Loki, anything else to know? I mean, this is just around the corner at this point,

520
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:25,640
right? About two months away. Um, well the connected, yeah, it's coming out November

521
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:31,200
4th. The actual, um, devices will be out, you know, soon as Microsoft sends them out.

522
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:34,560
Let me ask this question. Why are they doing a beta program for this? It seems weird because

523
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:38,920
you, we haven't heard of a lot of hardware beta tests. I mean, the last one I can remember

524
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:44,720
is the PlayStation two hard drive for Final Fantasy 11, but I don't hear this a lot. It's

525
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:51,160
really kind of unusual for them to be doing a lot of these. I would think it just word

526
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:56,360
of mouth maybe, um, getting people excited about it. You know, they're, there's, you

527
00:43:56,360 --> 00:44:02,240
know, a vast amount of NDA, you know, items on there. They're basically not wanting people

528
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:07,840
to share, you know, what's included in the new dashboard update and all this stuff. But

529
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:12,880
people talk anyways and I think that they realize that and it's just kind of like, you

530
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:16,440
know, Ooh, information I'm not supposed to know. I'm more interested now, you know, instead

531
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:24,760
of just, I don't know. So the whole thing is just a marketing thing. Or I mean, but

532
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:28,120
I'm sure at the same time though, there is like some troubleshooting stuff that they're

533
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:32,760
probably doing. Um, you know, just seeing, Hey, are there any bugs that we haven't thought

534
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:37,640
of yet that maybe are in this that we could patch day one or something. Um, you know,

535
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:42,880
that kind of stuff. But I'm curious how well that video chat works. I just want one. That's

536
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:47,440
all because I was actually kind of interested in the connect stuff, the move I could care

537
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:53,380
less about, but you know, it would be kind of fun. I would like to try out dance masters

538
00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:57,840
before it comes out. So I don't look like a total tool trying to play the game. Good

539
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:07,080
luck with that. I mean, you know, it's all, yes, I understand. Yeah, there's a lot of

540
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:12,240
the thing is when you look at choreographed dancing, um, it looks stupid if one person's

541
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:15,860
doing it. If a bunch of people are doing it at the same time, it looks cool because it's

542
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:23,480
all in sync. But when one person's doing it, it's not so cool. You mean or paradise? Exactly.

543
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:26,980
Like one person playing that game usually looked a little bit ridiculous, but when everybody

544
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:30,560
would stand behind the machine doing the same dance, like people would walk up like, how

545
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:37,760
do they know that? What do they do? What? It's a cult. That game is a cult. It's a trap.

546
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:41,120
Yeah. So that, that's the thing. You know, they're going to have like the routines from

547
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:46,840
like the music videos for some of these songs and yeah, it'll be kind of cool. Um, you would

548
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:53,000
have a bunch of people doing it, but can you imagine a bunch of sober people doing this

549
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,800
together? I can't imagine that. I'll, all I can imagine is, Hey, I'm going to play dance

550
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:00,840
masters and everyone going, ha, you look stupid or you know, what's going to be awesome is

551
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:05,120
learning on dance central. Let's say like how to dance to poker face central. I mean,

552
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:10,020
not dance masters, dance masters look stupid. Well, whatever. But like, let's say like you

553
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:14,520
learned the dance to, I don't know, poker face on dance central and like you and like

554
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:18,080
five year friends, I'll learn this dance and then you all go out to the club and when that

555
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:21,760
song comes on, you can all just start doing the dance. You're going to look weird. Well,

556
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:26,580
no, no. And people are going to look like you, you may look, but here's the thing though.

557
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:30,120
If you're all doing at the same time, it actually might look kind of cool. And people in clubs,

558
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:34,640
you know, they're kind of drunk anyways, so it doesn't matter. Um, no, but now, now if

559
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:39,320
you take a hilarious flash mobbing, it would be kind of cool. I mean, cause people, especially

560
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:42,680
if you have a bunch of hot chicks with you, no one's going to care. Um, you know, but

561
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:47,440
if you do what you learn and say dance masters in a club, people are going to think you're

562
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:55,800
a fucking idiot because it looks like Para. And unless you go to a club in Japan, I think

563
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:59,040
anytime you have a group of three or more, all doing the same thing, no matter what it

564
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:07,000
is, like in sync, it's going to be like interesting. I think it is weird. I mean, at least piece.

565
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:11,320
It kind of reminds me of when I used to go to the club long time ago. Um, there was a

566
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:16,140
guy that looked like he, it was literally like some grandpa dressed up like Michael

567
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:20,520
Jackson doing stuff. And it didn't matter what he was doing. It's interesting because

568
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:25,280
you're like, that's something I don't see every day. And that's the other thing too.

569
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:29,800
I mean, it'll get people's attention and really going to clubs. That's all what it's about.

570
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:34,280
It's getting people's attention because you know, that's what you crave. I don't know

571
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:38,160
how often you've been to gay bars, Loki, but there's, that's, that's like all the people

572
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:43,000
there on the dance floor, all that old man in the thriller outfit. Like I can think of

573
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:50,380
like, it takes a lot to stand out like that at a gay bar. It really does. Like the one

574
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:55,200
I remember is this fierce old drag queen that used to wear like a leotard looking like Jane

575
00:47:55,200 --> 00:48:03,440
Fonda out of the 1980s. They used to do like goth dancing to pop songs. That was unique.

576
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:10,040
That is unique. That's a, that was genres right there. That's right. It was, it was,

577
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:17,960
well, you know, America's the melting pot. So that sounds Rob. That sounds divine. Yes.

578
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:24,000
Yes. There will be interested in, in like dance central because look at how well, um,

579
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:28,200
just dance did. I mean that came out with like fucking nowhere. Just dance at the top

580
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:32,920
of the charts for like weeks. It's still, you know, a really popular Wii game. Where

581
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:37,040
the hell did that come from? So you know, if that has that kind of popularity and we

582
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:43,280
get the kind of support from, um, you know, harmonics with this, it'll be awesome. So

583
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:47,960
we'll just have to wait, which if they're given money, you know, they will. Yes. I'm

584
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:54,320
hoping the support's awesome. On the other hand, dance masters, Konami promises download

585
00:48:54,320 --> 00:49:00,520
content, but I have yet to see them actually come through with the download. We'll see.

586
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:04,600
You never know. Yeah. One thing I've been checking out, I upgraded my iPhone. Finally

587
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:08,620
I have one of the fours now and uh, I checked out like the DDR apps actually run smoothly

588
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:13,320
on the iPhone four. Now I was looking at DDR S plus the iPhone one and it's basically just

589
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:17,320
nothing but microtransactions, but there's a lot of songs in there and a lot of current

590
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:21,840
songs too. Like just dance by lady Gaga. You can't touch this by MC hammer and you know,

591
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:25,540
funny throwbacks like that. It does have a pretty extensive song library. I gotta say

592
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:30,200
I was, I was surprised cause I was expecting the library to be nothing but the same old

593
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:35,200
damn songs from fourth mix, fifth mix, max, max to extreme, you know, all the same old

594
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:40,080
songs, but it wasn't. There's a lot of different stuff in there. Kind of neat. Well I know

595
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:45,200
you can't touch this is actually in DDR X and I think just dance might be in one of

596
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:50,240
the newer probably are from other DDR games, but I was just surprised that they were licenses

597
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:54,240
no matter what it is. They, they are commercial. You know, they are still coming out with a

598
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:57,520
dance dance revolution. Remember how they were going back to dance dance revolution

599
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:02,760
to make it really confusing for the PS3 and the Wii. It's the move one. Oh, they're, they're

600
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:05,640
different games. Dance Dance Revolution on the Wii is just, it's an extension of hottest

601
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:09,600
party and they're not saying it, but it's, it's the same old like balance board mode

602
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:13,440
and all that stuff. And then the one on the PS3 is the move and then the 360 is not getting

603
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:18,400
DDR. It's getting dance masters. That's how it's working. Yeah, there it is. All right.

604
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:21,400
Hope you wrote down what I said really fast. If you need an explanation and something you

605
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:25,720
could use to write down real fast is a peripheral we talked about last week on the show. The

606
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:30,920
U-Draw. Remember this? Nice segue. Yeah, it's awesome, huh? The U-Draw was the third party

607
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:35,320
tablet that they were, I believe THQ was making it to do like a Pictionary game and there's

608
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:38,640
another game that they were making with this. Well, Dude's Adventure and then there's also

609
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:42,120
some actual drawing game that comes with the tablet. I'm glad someone was paying attention

610
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:47,320
last week. All right, well, there's a rumor out this week and it's being run on gonintendo.com,

611
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:51,120
which you know, they, they love their Nintendo over there. I guess they have a tipster who

612
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:55,100
says they have inside info on the U-Draw and I'm thinking if I'm Go Nintendo, I don't run

613
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:59,320
with this unless I know that there is some clout to this. You know, they've been around

614
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:06,500
a little while. So, here's the quote. Both games, talking about Nintendo themselves getting

615
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:11,840
into making games for the U-Draw, are designed with the mass market gamer in mind, yet honor

616
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:16,620
the passion of traditional gamers. And of course, one of the huge speculations right

617
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:21,200
off the bat, Mario Paint. Finally, a new Mario Paint on the Wii. Could it really be happening?

618
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:27,600
That'd be awesome. The Go Nintendo also speculates Kirby Canvas Curse, perhaps. Although, honestly,

619
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:30,960
insert any DS game here, they can make an adaptation for it. I don't know if they would

620
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:35,120
do another Kirby game that soon after Kirby's Epic Yarn, but. But if they're making it now,

621
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:38,640
it probably wouldn't be out until next Christmas, right? I want a Mario Paint and I want the

622
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:42,280
music mode. I think a Mario Paint would be great, although I believe it's one of those

623
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:46,640
games you sort of see through retro colored glasses where it was awesome when you were

624
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:52,640
12, but now it's... But the music mode was pretty rad. And there's still like a cultish

625
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:57,360
community for that. Imagine if they... There's an emulator for just the music mode. Okay,

626
00:51:57,360 --> 00:52:02,960
imagine if they brought back Mario Paint. Just... Call this a dream game if you want,

627
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:07,600
but just... This is... If Nintendo knew what they were doing... Maybe this could be a segment

628
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:11,440
on the show. If Nintendo knew what they were doing, what would happen to Mario Paint? Here,

629
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:18,320
let me help you with that. Yeah. Free help, free advice. They would bring back the Mario

630
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:23,560
music mode, but what they would do is they would really cash in on this whole chiptune

631
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:27,920
thing that's being made big again with the Scott Pilgrim game, and you know, chiptunes

632
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:33,320
are just kind of in right now. And a lot of the little symbols would make chiptune-y type

633
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:39,240
of noises, and it would be really easy in Mario Paint Wii to make chiptune sounds. And

634
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:42,840
they would still have some of the dumb stuff, like the cats meowing and the dogs barking

635
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:47,440
that people make songs out of, but if they really wanted to make a really thorough chiptune...

636
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:52,000
And when I say thorough, I mean it's still easy to use like the old Mario Paint was,

637
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:56,840
but it has a lot of options. I think there's a big cash cow there for that. And then imagine,

638
00:52:56,840 --> 00:53:00,940
again, if Nintendo knew what they were doing, you could upload to the internet and share

639
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:07,080
with other people. What a concept. What a concept! Or publish... I know this might be

640
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:13,440
hard to imagine, but if Nintendo knew what they were doing, if you put an SD card...

641
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:16,880
And there's obviously a joke here, because Nintendo is the number one system. They do

642
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:21,080
know what they're doing in some regards, but you know, if Nintendo wanted to make me happy,

643
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:26,120
you have those SD cards that you can put in the slot on the Wii. Imagine if the chiptune

644
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:30,280
music-making mode in this hypothetical Mario Paint game that I've completely made up, you

645
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:35,200
could export MP3s to the SD card. Oh my god. It wouldn't be MP3s. Oh my god. It would be

646
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:42,200
AAC files because, remember, they don't support MP3s anymore. Okay, fine. AACs then. Still.

647
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:47,120
Still. It would be amazing. It would be very amazing. And then while you're at it, you

648
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:52,760
release a DS version, or a DSi version that comes out as well, where not only can you

649
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:59,120
draw stuff, but you can take pictures of things and then, you know, edit them and do all that

650
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:03,860
fun stuff. Alright, well, what do you guys think the other game could possibly be? Mario

651
00:54:03,860 --> 00:54:07,680
Paint, I think, is the number one fanboy request. What would be the other one? If you were making

652
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:15,680
a game for UDraw in a Nintendo franchise, what do you think it could be? Magic Pen Jell.

653
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:22,080
It's not Nintendo franchise. That'd be awesome. Maybe if Nintendo made an RPG or something

654
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:28,320
like that. I don't think I played... That game was so sweet. Graffiti Kingdom, I remember

655
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:32,040
that came out, that was pretty awesome too, but I didn't play that very much. I'm gonna

656
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:41,360
say the other drawing game is a generic Wii blank game. Like, Wii Party, Wii Sports, Wii...

657
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:45,000
One of those, what's the island called now that they have all these games on, and the

658
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:49,400
Wii Fit? There's gonna be a Wii Draw. That's the other Nintendo game. It's just Wii Draw.

659
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:52,760
Of course, then again, that would just be Mario Paint, wouldn't it? So maybe that's

660
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:56,320
what you're getting instead of Mario Paint. What if they had it where you can play Pikmin

661
00:54:56,320 --> 00:55:00,760
on it or something like that? Ah, now you're talking. Or like an RTS of some sort. Recreation

662
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:08,080
of the stylus. Like with DS games. Imagine how much easier, by the way, playing Cooking

663
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:14,880
Mama on the Wii would be. With a U-Draw. Yeah. Perhaps. Well, you know, it's not Cooking

664
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:19,380
Mama anymore, it's Crafting Mama. That's the next one. The other thing I wanted to say

665
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:23,680
about this real quick, isn't it weird though that you have a first party person supporting

666
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:29,160
a third party device? Like, if Nintendo was planning on making games for this, wouldn't

667
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:34,240
they just suddenly say, maybe we want to buy this and make it a first party peripheral?

668
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:37,800
Like it seems weird to me that THQ is putting this out, but Nintendo is supporting it. These

669
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:41,280
things are supposed to work in reverse. Um, not necessarily, because they could just team

670
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:45,600
up with them and have it actually where they release the peripheral. It'll probably be

671
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:49,600
bundled with one of their games. Like if they came out with a Mario Paint, for example,

672
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:54,920
it would be bundled with the U-Draw tablet. It's just, you know, made by third parties.

673
00:55:54,920 --> 00:56:01,920
It's kind of like, um, well, I don't know. There's not really anything out there that's

674
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:09,000
kind of like that right now, where there's supporting a, you know, third party device.

675
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:14,560
That's what I'm saying. But hey, whatever. There's a first for everything. I guess that's

676
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:18,960
true. Okay, Dark Sakura, speaking of firsts, she hasn't gotten to give us a news story

677
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:25,640
tonight yet. I know! Okay, how about some stuff for Red Dead Redemption? AKA Grand Theft

678
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:31,560
Horse. And I hate that these stupid ads on the site decide that they want to completely

679
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:37,160
cover the entire page and not give me the little button to close the damn thing. There.

680
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:42,600
Anyway, um, this is for Red Dead Redemption, the Liars and Cheats pack has a date in the

681
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:50,080
UK. And for the PS3 and 360, it will be released on the 21st of September. It'll be £7.99

682
00:56:50,080 --> 00:57:00,200
on PlayStation Network and 800 Microsoft Points. That's roughly 9.60 in Euros. So, um, it was

683
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:04,920
going to be free, but they've decided to make it super nice and then they can give away

684
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:11,000
free packs. So, anyway, it's going to have different multiplayer modes, one called Stronghold,

685
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:19,080
where you take turns as attack and defense, multiplayer horse races, poker, liar's dice,

686
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:27,360
an explosive rifle, gang hideouts, hunting grounds, and 15 of the characters in story

687
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:37,200
mode will be playable character skins. So that's cool. So, Loki, you play a lot of Grand

688
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:41,040
Theft Auto at work, and Dark Soccer made a joke calling it Grand Theft Horse. Why do

689
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:45,360
you think Red Dead Redemption hasn't caught on with your little crowd? Well, we did. We

690
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:51,200
play that sometimes. It's just we don't have four copies of it. We only have three. So

691
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:55,080
we don't really play. And the thing about Red Dead Redemption that doesn't really work

692
00:57:55,080 --> 00:58:00,000
too well for a multiplayer is, I mean, the free mode stuff is kind of fun, but if you

693
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:05,280
want to do deathmatch, you have to basically go to a deathmatch location on the map and

694
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:09,320
then you have to trigger it and invite your other people in there. And if it's anything

695
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:14,400
like the times we've tried to set up before, the game's really dumb as far as setting up

696
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:20,620
games. Like, for example, we set up a deathmatch one time, and I invited everybody. They accepted.

697
00:58:20,620 --> 00:58:24,360
It started loading the game, and then we ended up in the three separate deathmatches where

698
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:29,840
we were the only player there. I was like, what the hell? So that's why we don't play

699
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:37,240
Red Dead Redemption right now. We've been just playing Grand Theft Auto. It's fun to

700
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:42,280
stick with. Plus, they're really itching for me to get the mod game back up again so we

701
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:47,920
can play that again, because that was some of the best games we've ever played. And the

702
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:53,480
best part about it is, the guy that made one of the mod tools, OpenIV, they have a beta

703
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:57,820
version that's out there now that I signed up for the beta for that, and the new version

704
00:58:57,820 --> 00:59:03,420
allows us to edit the files for Red Dead Redemption. Ah, make your own expansion pack. But it's

705
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:08,120
a very different format, so that's something I need to explore. I have to dump it to my

706
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:16,320
hard drive first, but it'll be interesting to check that out. I also had another bit

707
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:22,520
for this story as well. For Red Dead Redemption, there's a rumor going around that they're

708
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:27,360
casting for the movie and asked to Brad Pitt. Wow, I just saw that comment from Tiger Claw

709
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:31,200
in our chat room, too. It was saying that at chat.orangehunter.com, he said, oh yeah,

710
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:34,320
you heard that Brad Pitt might star in a Red Dead Redemption movie. Why does that sound

711
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:41,000
like fanboy wank to me? It sounds like fanboy wank to me. Well, according to this, they've

712
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:47,920
given him first refusal on it, so, I don't know. You know, I also heard, I saw on Live

713
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:54,120
Journal or somewhere that apparently they cast, what's his name from Lost, Matthew Fox

714
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:57,560
as the main guy in Mass Effect, which I guess they're making an actual movie out of. And

715
00:59:57,560 --> 01:00:01,920
I looked at that and I said, boy, that sounds like fanboy wank. I didn't even know they

716
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:04,640
were gonna make a legitimate Mass Effect movie. I thought they would wait until the trilogy

717
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:12,000
is done. But maybe they're gonna try to release it at the same time? I don't know. Well, I

718
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:17,080
have to check and see. I didn't read the show roll all the way yet, but there was another

719
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:25,320
movie thing, I don't remember if we're talking about it or not. I don't think so. I don't

720
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:30,800
think so. If we spoil it, we spoil it, oops. And whatever, okay, so it's that, and honestly,

721
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:35,260
I am not familiar with this series because I don't own an iPhone or something like that,

722
01:00:35,260 --> 01:00:41,600
but was it Big Angry Bird or something like that? Oh yeah, I've heard of Angry Birds.

723
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:49,360
So they're supposed to be making a movie out of that. That sounds dumb, but I don't know.

724
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:54,040
Interesting. I don't know what kind of game you'd make out of that, but whatever. I think

725
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:59,360
what it's come down to is the movie industry is really hurting for original ideas, so now

726
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:05,520
they're trying to just develop everything into a movie. And a perfect example of that

727
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:12,920
is the whole Hasbro licensing with the Ouija game, or Ouija game, the movie, or Battleship

728
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:18,240
the movie, or Monopoly the movie. They did Ouija the movie, it was called The Exorcist.

729
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:22,860
Or this nonsense that they're remaking Clue, the movie. They're not remaking the 80s version

730
01:01:22,860 --> 01:01:27,280
of Clue, which will always be a timeless classic. Oh no, yeah. They're just gonna make a new

731
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:32,960
movie based off of Clue that'll be, I'm sure it's wonderful, the piece of cinema is the

732
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:37,280
Clue 2 murder and disguise VCR game where you get to see Mr. Green dressed up as Madame

733
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:47,280
Rose. It was quality cinema. So yeah, it's just terrible ideas right now. It's very unfortunate.

734
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:53,720
So yes, last week we talked a little bit about a possible Playstation 3 mod chip, which apparently

735
01:01:53,720 --> 01:02:05,440
is real. And it is being dealt with swiftly by Sony as well. It was confirmed, I guess,

736
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:10,400
by a bunch of different sources that, you know, despite the fact that one video showed

737
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:18,080
it running on a dev console, it is actually the real deal. It's actually sold out as well.

738
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:23,960
And of course, it goes without saying that Sony, they say they have a way to detect whether

739
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:31,400
you're running it or not, and they will ban you. So buyer beware, I suppose. And apparently

740
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:38,600
the device is kind of similar to the Pandora battery that was on the PSP. They're not sure

741
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:43,740
if they can actually block the device from working with a software update. They may actually

742
01:02:43,740 --> 01:02:53,240
have to change the way the hardware is made in order to block the device from working.

743
01:02:53,240 --> 01:03:00,960
And Sony has actually, Sony Australia has granted a temporary injunction by the federal

744
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:06,520
court to block the importation and sale of the new mod chips as well. It is a temporary

745
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:15,240
injunction means until August 31st. So during that time, actually Sony will have, I guess,

746
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:19,060
they're the only ones that they can be sold to, and I'm not sure if they actually get

747
01:03:19,060 --> 01:03:21,440
to seize the hardware or whatever.

748
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:25,620
But that's just, like this device wasn't made in Australia, right?

749
01:03:25,620 --> 01:03:32,140
This isn't made in Australia, but Oz Mod Chips was one of the first, you know, first mod

750
01:03:32,140 --> 01:03:39,200
chip reseller that has, you know, had these chips. So, I don't know, it puts, I guess

751
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:44,560
it blocks something. You know, we'll see, August 31st is like, what, a couple days away,

752
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:50,680
so it might just be, you know, especially if they aren't granted an extension on that,

753
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:55,900
you better believe that they're going to kick that shit out of the door immediately, so.

754
01:03:55,900 --> 01:04:00,200
Or you could just import one from the US, Canada, Switzerland, right?

755
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:05,200
Exactly, so. Unless, unless, and I don't know, unless maybe they were the first ones to get

756
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:10,620
it, and then those companies are buying it from Oz Mod Chips, who knows.

757
01:04:10,620 --> 01:04:15,920
And so of course, yeah, the, basically the temporary injunction does halt the sale to

758
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:26,320
anyone but Sony. Apparently, they are legally forced to sell the PS jail breaks to Sony,

759
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:31,880
and in any case, they, I guess they have a chance to figure out how the thing works in

760
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:36,760
the meantime. I'm sure that they could buy one anyways. They probably will try to figure

761
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:41,760
out how it works. And if anything, it probably works very similar to the way their, I guess,

762
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:47,840
dev kit stuff works. And then of course, the reason why they're trying to, or they got

763
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:52,660
the temporary injunction anyways, is saying that apparently the device uses some sort

764
01:04:52,660 --> 01:04:58,320
of code that's from the dev, you know, dev kit or something like that, that, you know,

765
01:04:58,320 --> 01:05:05,580
is proprietary and that, you know, it's violating whatever. Of course, the, whoever is making

766
01:05:05,580 --> 01:05:11,760
these chips actually are saying that they don't use any of that stuff, and they aren't

767
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:16,720
too worried by what's going on. They're saying, you know, there was kind of a short back and

768
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:26,320
forth Q&A with them. It says, companies in Australia get a lot of problems. Sony halts

769
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:31,680
Australian resellers. Is this a big problem? And it says it's a temporary injunction until

770
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:38,720
August 31st. Will be reached then. Nothing illegal has been done. It's just a scare tactic.

771
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:43,520
And it says there's no copyright code and we have not interfered with any intellectual

772
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:50,120
property laws. The device is designed for homebrew. Nothing illegal. I guess you can

773
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:57,040
say nothing illegal, but yeah, obviously it can be used both ways. The product is very

774
01:05:57,040 --> 01:06:03,480
different from every other mod. Nothing illegal. Once again, they, you know, reinforcing that.

775
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:09,640
Yes, but all these shops, returning customers, money back, people informed saying the order

776
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:14,360
is canceled. It says it's just a scare tactic. It's obviously working. It will work in Europe

777
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:22,480
also. Then everyone will be missing out on lots of profits. Too bad for everyone who

778
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:31,760
gets scared easily. The strong ones will make out more now. And it says, yes, technically

779
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:38,460
shops do not know anything or know how the USB 6 works. Boot code or something like that

780
01:06:38,460 --> 01:06:42,960
because of this, people are scared and think that they can't win. We don't want to take

781
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:47,880
the risk. Um, but you understand, you see, um, nothing, there's nothing to be scared

782
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:51,520
about. No copyright infringement, no your affairs. They sound very foreign because it's

783
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:58,960
very broken English, but we'll see. Um, like I said, I have one on order for the hell of

784
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:04,360
it because I like to get everything, especially stuff that people don't want me to have. And

785
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:10,480
uh, nice rationale, whatever, you know, I don't have to, you know, justify it. I spend

786
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:16,040
plenty of money on games. Um, and then, so I have one on order and I'm not worried about

787
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:21,520
it cause you know, like they said, you know, if, if for some reason Sony does put some

788
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:26,380
permanent injunction, if you know, prevents them from selling it, I get my money back.

789
01:07:26,380 --> 01:07:32,560
If they don't, I get a mod chip. I don't see how I lose out in this scenario. So it's not

790
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:37,560
a big deal. All right. Well, I don't know if the jailbreak will help out with this situation

791
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:41,280
if it's adopted by Sony, but it's something that's becoming more and more popular. We've

792
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:46,240
talked about it quite at length on this show. It's the online pass. Yeah. You remember that?

793
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:51,720
Uh, it's showing up in the EA sports games now and I think THQ Ubisoft supposedly is

794
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:56,200
putting this on board. Um, and if you don't remember what the online pass is, it's where

795
01:07:56,200 --> 01:08:03,360
you pay $10 if you buy the game used for like a code so that you can actually play the game

796
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:08,800
online and unlock other features. Um, it's locked out if you don't have the code. Obviously

797
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:13,400
if you buy the game new, it comes with a code. Well guess what company is supposedly getting

798
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:19,360
on board? Sony. That's right. Sony themselves for their first party games. This is a comment

799
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:23,560
from a Sony computer entertainment Europe, Andrew House quote on the principle of making

800
01:08:23,560 --> 01:08:28,160
online portions of the game available or unlocked from the disc base released for a fee. We're

801
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:34,920
broadly supportive of that and we're exploring actively the same option for our own content.

802
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:40,360
Because of mod chips like this. I mean, think about that. That's one way. Well, we'll prevent

803
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:46,000
people from getting online because they will have access to a code to get online. Therefore,

804
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:52,740
you know, enticing people to buy games. Now, of course this story made rounds all over

805
01:08:52,740 --> 01:08:56,240
the internet because, you know, here in Sony is going to jump on board, gets, you know,

806
01:08:56,240 --> 01:09:01,280
people's ears perked. But I like this particular perspective on it that was on Destructoid.

807
01:09:01,280 --> 01:09:04,500
One of their authors over there when they ran the story said this, I thought this was

808
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:09,680
very good. Again, this is from Destructoid.com. Quote, it seems that this is most certainly

809
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:14,280
the future of online play. Buy new or pay for it. I still think it's ludicrous. The

810
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:18,680
industry relies more on trading credit than I think any publisher will want to admit.

811
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:22,280
And if trade in values are diminished because of this, well, good luck trying to compete

812
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:26,320
in an already competitive market when gamers find themselves even less able to afford your

813
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:32,980
$60 luxuries and sums it up with this. The author does. If used games disappeared tomorrow,

814
01:09:32,980 --> 01:09:40,560
the market would crash. I guarantee it. I think that's true. Um, he makes an interesting point.

815
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:45,640
I it's, it's, it's a really interesting point. Well, it is an interesting point and here,

816
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:50,440
here's my point to it right now. As of right now, the stuff that they seem to be targeting

817
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:55,440
is sports games. You know, I don't know if you should, if you're a sports game or if

818
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:58,800
you should take offense to that because really they're the ones that they seem to be targeting

819
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:05,560
because right now it's just UFC 2010, the, uh, Tiger Woods, you know, or Tiger Woods

820
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:13,380
2011, NCAA 11, Madden 11, um, and then of course, um, Smackdown versus Raw 11. Those

821
01:10:13,380 --> 01:10:17,100
are all, if you would consider sports titles right now. And they're also talking that this

822
01:10:17,100 --> 01:10:21,960
is going to be done in, I guess, MLB, the show 11. It's interesting that you say that

823
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:26,640
because Raman, our chat room at chat.orangelandstrategy.com says, I have no problem with the online pass

824
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:31,320
since they're just for sports games. Once it passes to non sports games, then I'll have

825
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:36,720
a problem with it. Um, it seems to me there's different types of gamers too. You know, you

826
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:42,240
have, um, you have people that buy their systems, their consoles, and this is a significant

827
01:10:42,240 --> 01:10:49,120
amount of people for nothing but Madden, NBA, and a lot of those games that Loki named save

828
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:54,880
for the occasional Halo, Call of Duty, and those types of, of mega games. And then you

829
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:58,160
have kind of the gamers, like I think the majority of the people that listen to our

830
01:10:58,160 --> 01:11:03,560
show that like to play some of the more gamer oriented titles that really have nothing to

831
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:07,460
do with sports games. And of course there's some crossover as I'm not saying none of you

832
01:11:07,460 --> 01:11:11,440
like to play sports games. Even I like Double Dribble and Blades of Steel and some of those

833
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:15,920
old school sports games. But you know what I mean. Like, you know, there, there definitely

834
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:21,200
is kind of two factions of gaming if you will. So it is interesting that only this one seems

835
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:25,880
to be impacted so far by this. Um, and something I would like to add, it was a story that didn't

836
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:32,600
make our show roll, but I thought it was very ballsy of them to be, you know, making this

837
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:39,160
sort of argument. But THQ basically called people that buy used games cheaters. Like

838
01:11:39,160 --> 01:11:45,760
they're cheating, you know, the devs out of, you know, their hard earned money or something.

839
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:46,760
That's ridiculous.

840
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:50,220
That's just kind of an ignorant argument. Like I re- I'm trying to see where they're

841
01:11:50,220 --> 01:11:56,600
coming from, but that's very ignorant to the world we live in because like, does Paramount

842
01:11:56,600 --> 01:12:02,540
Pictures and 20th Century Fox say that about used DVD sales and used Blu-ray sales and

843
01:12:02,540 --> 01:12:09,360
a lot of the used- I mean, what is a garage sale? Is a garage sale a cheating party? Like

844
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:13,520
just, I mean, selling your old shit is a part of American culture.

845
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:18,440
Here's what I don't understand that they're complaining anyways because, here's the thing.

846
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:23,920
When they've sold it to their retailer, they've already sold their copies to the retailer,

847
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:27,880
they have their money, it's up to the retailer to decide, hey, if people are buying used

848
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:32,560
copies, then, you know, that sucks for me because I still have this new copy on the

849
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:36,800
shelf or something like that. But I don't under- it's dumb.

850
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:42,980
Basically anyways, THQ's Corey Ledesma basically said, I don't think we really care whether

851
01:12:42,980 --> 01:12:49,380
used game buyers are upset because the new game buyers get everything. He says, so if

852
01:12:49,380 --> 01:12:53,800
used game buyers are upset that they don't get online features set, I don't really have

853
01:12:53,800 --> 01:13:00,100
much sympathy for them. That's a little blunt, but we hope it doesn't disappoint people.

854
01:13:00,100 --> 01:13:07,200
We hope that people understand that when the games bought used, we get cheated.

855
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:10,840
I don't see how you get cheated because there's still the same amount of people playing your

856
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:17,360
damn game that there were before. You know, I don't understand how that you're cheated.

857
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:21,400
And if anything, say someone buys it used and they like it, then they go out and buy

858
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:25,600
it in the next version. Say, you know, I bought Saints Row One used or something like that,

859
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:29,000
and I'm like, whoa, this is an awesome game. And Saints Row Two comes out, I buy it new

860
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:32,800
day one. I don't understand how they lose out on this, but I'll tell you something,

861
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:39,320
I'm not fucking buying your sports games, so whatever. And I'll tell you why, man. I'll

862
01:13:39,320 --> 01:13:42,800
think twice about buying your other games if you have this kind of crap.

863
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:45,080
Or the U-Draw, which we talked about earlier in the show.

864
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:48,200
Well, the U-Draw's not going to have that because Wii doesn't really do online stuff

865
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:54,000
too much, and that's not really what they're going after, but it's still retarded to think

866
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,000
that-

867
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,200
It's still, it's the same company.

868
01:13:56,200 --> 01:14:01,000
And they've made excuses left and right, and you know, oh, we get cheated out of stuff.

869
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:04,880
Well, wait a second, you get cheated because you're not selling a new copy, and so you're

870
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:08,200
trying to entice people to buy new copies? But I thought before you were saying that

871
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:12,200
you needed this extra money to support your online services that you're now providing

872
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:17,600
extra options for. Oh, wait, but now you're just saying that it's because, you know, all

873
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:23,400
these U-Sails are really cutting into your profits. Be glad you're selling copies at

874
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:27,400
all, because if you keep this kind of attitude up, you know, hey, let me tell you this much,

875
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:29,400
it hasn't helped Activision too much.

876
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:35,900
Uh, gotta go to our chatroom, chat.orangessontrady.com. Rama just kind of takes one glove off and

877
01:14:35,900 --> 01:14:41,400
slaps THQ across the face, saying, no, the companies that market the games at $59.99

878
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:42,400
are cheaters.

879
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:46,800
And, and the other thing too, is on top of all that stuff, calling these people cheaters

880
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:51,100
and stuff, and you're putting out these sports games, and I don't want to make generic, you

881
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:56,300
know, I don't want to put out generic opinions of these sports games, but a lot of people

882
01:14:56,300 --> 01:15:00,100
kind of agreed that a lot of times these are just kind of roster updates that they put

883
01:15:00,100 --> 01:15:01,200
out each year, and...

884
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:06,000
Well, to be fair, it's the way that that faction looks at music games.

885
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:10,300
Exactly. And, and don't get me wrong, I mean, a lot of music games out there, especially

886
01:15:10,300 --> 01:15:16,400
the Guitar Freak series, is just a different song list each year, and, and that's it. But

887
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:23,600
I mean, there isn't, it's not like, you know, vast improvements between each game, and the

888
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:27,700
fact that they're saying, oh, well, we want you to pay extra money for this, oh, and then

889
01:15:27,700 --> 01:15:30,700
we have this download content that could have been added in there for free, but, you know,

890
01:15:30,700 --> 01:15:34,700
we want a little bit more money, and oh, now you bought it used, so now you have to pay

891
01:15:34,700 --> 01:15:35,700
for online access.

892
01:15:35,700 --> 01:15:40,400
But guess what, you know? Maybe the used players will learn not to really give a shit about

893
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:45,100
the online access. Then what are you gonna do? Oh, look, they bought all your used games,

894
01:15:45,100 --> 01:15:48,700
you're still getting cheated, and they're not buying your stupid, you know, internet

895
01:15:48,700 --> 01:15:49,700
access.

896
01:15:49,700 --> 01:15:53,100
Let me get to other chatroom comments. ActDeaf in our chatroom says, don't know, the used

897
01:15:53,100 --> 01:15:57,900
DVDs and Blu-ray market ain't that big. Keep in mind, he's in another country, so I, I

898
01:15:57,900 --> 01:16:03,400
don't know if, if that changes the perspective. I mean, I think if there's a store here that

899
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:06,100
does nothing but sell used DVDs and, and that sort of thing.

900
01:16:06,100 --> 01:16:11,400
I can, I can tell you right now that the, the studios don't like used sales, because

901
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:16,300
at one time we were buying, because you know, Redbox and stuff, they have, they turn over

902
01:16:16,300 --> 01:16:20,900
their DVDs quite quick, and they have to offload all that used product. Well, we used to buy

903
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:26,100
it, and then turn around and sell it. They don't care for that too much, but it, you

904
01:16:26,100 --> 01:16:31,200
know, it's still legal practice, but they, what they do now is they make them destroy

905
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:37,400
their product after all these deals that they have in place with the vendors. But they don't

906
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:40,700
care for it too much, but it doesn't really impact them too much. They kind of blame piracy

907
01:16:40,700 --> 01:16:45,500
over, you know, any, a few movies used, but okay. Maybe, maybe it's just because we have

908
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:48,500
this handy-dandy store near me that it makes it really easy.

909
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:52,500
Um, Akdeft goes on to say, they're cheated out of the money they should have supposed

910
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:57,400
to get with the sale of the new game. Uh, let's see, Rama says, I'm sorry, THQ, wrestling

911
01:16:57,400 --> 01:17:02,600
games are not sports games, since WWE and so on is sports entertainment. Satellite Minded

912
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:07,200
says, people are already paying to play games online. Why do they have to pay more for content

913
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:13,300
that's on the disc? And Tiger Claw says, it all comes down to one word, greed.

914
01:17:13,300 --> 01:17:21,100
And I agree, and you know what? Um, it's kind of funny though, like, if Microsoft did this,

915
01:17:21,100 --> 01:17:25,400
I think there would be a shit storm, you know, because people are already paying for online

916
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:30,100
access and they'd be like, why the fuck do I got to pay for more online access?

917
01:17:30,100 --> 01:17:31,600
That's probably why they don't.

918
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:36,200
It's probably smart to do this. It's probably like, let's see how it plays out over there.

919
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:41,100
It's not a popular idea. Um, I just don't think it's necessary. If you want to make

920
01:17:41,100 --> 01:17:45,500
your, here's what you need to do. It's so simple, and you know, a lot of times they're

921
01:17:45,500 --> 01:17:52,300
doing it already, but all you got to do is just sell download content, you know? You

922
01:17:52,300 --> 01:17:56,700
don't even necessarily have to, you know, cut stuff out of your game, but just support

923
01:17:56,700 --> 01:17:59,900
it with download content and you'll make a lot of money back, whether they bought it

924
01:17:59,900 --> 01:18:03,900
new or used. If they bought it new, great, you make that sale and you make additional

925
01:18:03,900 --> 01:18:09,600
money, but if they bought it used, they're still buying download content. And I don't

926
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:13,700
see how you lose out of that because that's digital. It's pure profit, pretty much.

927
01:18:13,700 --> 01:18:18,700
Alright, let's move on. We spent a lot of time on this topic. We've got a lot more stories

928
01:18:18,700 --> 01:18:23,200
to cover. Speaking of legal things, I believe Dark Sakura's got a more legally oriented

929
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:27,100
story for us. They could also be setting a precedent soon for the future of games.

930
01:18:27,100 --> 01:18:39,000
That I do. There is a case that was, the US Supreme Court is going to be reviewing Schwarzenegger

931
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:45,300
versus the Entertainment Merchants Association about a law that they're trying to get passed

932
01:18:45,300 --> 01:18:55,300
here that would put fines on renting or selling violent games to kids. Because, and the way

933
01:18:55,300 --> 01:19:03,000
they're trying to get around the First Amendment rule is that they're easier to get their hands

934
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:09,400
on and would cause more immediate harm than seeing it through TV movies or the internet.

935
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:17,900
How is buying a video game easier than TV? TV, you turn a box on and it, that astounds

936
01:19:17,900 --> 01:19:24,500
me. That's a bold argument. It's dumb. I don't understand why they're making this argument.

937
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:28,100
They're wasting time on issues that really don't need to be even focused on.

938
01:19:28,100 --> 01:19:36,100
The rest of the issue, too, is that while there are rules protecting minors from sexual

939
01:19:36,100 --> 01:19:43,100
imagery, there's not too many about violence. The way that I see that is, again, it's scapegoapism.

940
01:19:43,100 --> 01:19:47,100
You know, easy target, let's put everything on the video games and absolve the parents

941
01:19:47,100 --> 01:19:48,100
of their responsibility.

942
01:19:48,100 --> 01:19:51,100
Exactly. That's all it is. Because, you know, if the parents aren't going to be responsible,

943
01:19:51,100 --> 01:19:55,000
the government's got to be responsible for the kids, right? Because that's the stance

944
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:59,300
that they want to take. I think it's absolutely stupid that they're going to have laws. They're

945
01:19:59,300 --> 01:20:04,300
even going to, really, I think it might be a way to generate some revenue, you know,

946
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:09,300
for, you know, the states or whatever, just so they can find these people and make some

947
01:20:09,300 --> 01:20:16,500
extra money. Maybe that's why they're driven to do this. But I don't see, I think it's

948
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:19,500
really up to the parent to decide what's appropriate for their children.

949
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:20,500
Agreed.

950
01:20:20,500 --> 01:20:23,400
You know, you want to play violent video games and that's fine. Like, you know, Halo and

951
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:28,700
M-rated game, I don't think that's really that bad. I think, you know, an adolescent,

952
01:20:28,700 --> 01:20:34,400
you know, kid can handle that kind of stuff because it's really sci-fi. Now, Manhunt or

953
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:38,800
something like that, that's a little different. But it's all what you decide is appropriate

954
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:39,800
for your child.

955
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:44,900
I know I've brought this up before, but have you seen that episode in Season 7 of Bullshit

956
01:20:44,900 --> 01:20:48,900
where they talked about video games and they had You Know Who on it?

957
01:20:48,900 --> 01:20:49,900
No.

958
01:20:49,900 --> 01:20:54,000
Well, they did this one and they got permission for everything. There's a kid who's really

959
01:20:54,000 --> 01:21:00,000
good at first person shooters, like seven or eight years old. And so they get a marine

960
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:05,000
or an ex-marine or someone who's really, you know, who's a big gamer and also really good

961
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:10,200
with guns, runs a shooting range. And they take the kid out to go shoot an actual gun,

962
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:16,800
a real gun. His mom's there. They've got cops there. Everything's cool. Kids shot the gun

963
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:27,100
once and didn't want to touch it again. And it had him reduced to tears. So clearly there

964
01:21:27,100 --> 01:21:32,700
is a difference. You know, if you play a game, you know, a violent game on the TV or even

965
01:21:32,700 --> 01:21:38,300
a little gun game on the TV versus shooting an actual firearm.

966
01:21:38,300 --> 01:21:42,400
I've gone into a similar thing on this show. You know, I enjoy the occasional, you know,

967
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:47,200
earthquake, unreal tournament and shooting game, but I don't like guns at all. I don't

968
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:52,300
ever want one in my house. I'm against them for me. I realize there's a second amendment.

969
01:21:52,300 --> 01:21:55,500
If other people want to have them, that's their right. But for me, I hate guns, like

970
01:21:55,500 --> 01:21:59,860
real ones. And, but I like gun games.

971
01:21:59,860 --> 01:22:06,820
But see, it's totally, it doesn't teach you how to kill people. If anything, it teaches

972
01:22:06,820 --> 01:22:10,980
you maybe, you know, tactics and stuff like that. But it does, in the end, it doesn't

973
01:22:10,980 --> 01:22:14,860
teach you how to actually fire the weapon or use the weapon or anything like that.

974
01:22:14,860 --> 01:22:19,060
And the human mind is going to be far more creative than an AI in a game would be.

975
01:22:19,060 --> 01:22:23,700
Let me get to our chatroom chat.ornisadger.com. Frisbee wants to know California residents,

976
01:22:23,700 --> 01:22:27,900
when does Arnold leave the governor seat? January, I believe. And ironically enough,

977
01:22:27,900 --> 01:22:33,020
just a couple of days after this is heard is the election. And it's, it's past the primaries

978
01:22:33,020 --> 01:22:40,140
and it's down to the Meg Whitman's, the former CEO of eBay. She's the Republican. And then

979
01:22:40,140 --> 01:22:44,300
you have Jerry Brown, who was the governor of California in the late seventies, early

980
01:22:44,300 --> 01:22:49,220
eighties. Um, but because term limits didn't go in until after he was in office, he's able

981
01:22:49,220 --> 01:22:53,900
to run again. So it's a very interesting matchup. Very interesting.

982
01:22:53,900 --> 01:22:58,260
In neither one. I like that's the way a lot of people in the state feel. And it's, I hate

983
01:22:58,260 --> 01:23:02,500
her a lot just because of her campaign right now, because it's just smear, smear, smear,

984
01:23:02,500 --> 01:23:08,540
smear, smear. And for a lot of people I talk to it's, who do you dislike less? I've made

985
01:23:08,540 --> 01:23:13,300
up my mind, but I'm, I'm also a one issue kind of person and both candidates have made

986
01:23:13,300 --> 01:23:19,420
it pretty clear where they stand on the issue. So I'm, I, uh, I know where I'm voting. Um,

987
01:23:19,420 --> 01:23:24,020
my absentee ballot should be coming before too long. Are you voting for Bill the cat?

988
01:23:24,020 --> 01:23:31,520
No, but keep him, keep in mind that I, I vote absentee every time I vote so that I can make

989
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:38,300
photocopy of my vote and then mail in my original so that it can't be tampered with. But that's

990
01:23:38,300 --> 01:23:45,780
funny. Um, well the other thing I was going to say too, um, in response to the whole violent

991
01:23:45,780 --> 01:23:49,700
video game things, and we've also brought this up too, is that the rate of violence

992
01:23:49,700 --> 01:23:57,220
has gone down in minors since, or at least gun related violence I think, or armed violence

993
01:23:57,220 --> 01:24:04,960
has gone down since 1991, you know, when the Nintendo popped up. Um, another thing too,

994
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:13,860
and this just has to go to, uh, guns in general, is I think that a lack of exposure opens up

995
01:24:13,860 --> 01:24:21,500
the door, I think, for putting people in danger. Um, because it's actually a proven statistic

996
01:24:21,500 --> 01:24:26,540
that in those gun free zones, you know what I'm talking about, that the rate of, uh, of

997
01:24:26,540 --> 01:24:33,980
gun related violence is higher because anyone... People always want what they can't have. Well,

998
01:24:33,980 --> 01:24:38,980
it's not just that. If it's a gun free zone, then people who normally carry a firearm on

999
01:24:38,980 --> 01:24:46,460
themselves, a legal firearm, and follow the law, who won't be armed. They won't be armed.

1000
01:24:46,460 --> 01:24:50,260
It makes people a target. It's, it's, if you, you know in a place you're going to go somewhere

1001
01:24:50,260 --> 01:24:53,740
where you've got a likely chance that they're going to be following the rules there, you've

1002
01:24:53,740 --> 01:25:00,200
got an easy target. It's just, it's those states where, uh, people are allowed to carry

1003
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:04,860
firearms on them, that they have the lowest amount, because an armed society is a polite

1004
01:25:04,860 --> 01:25:13,620
society. But, going back, these are related, trust me. But, um, if you can establish this

1005
01:25:13,620 --> 01:25:18,860
difference, make them something that someone's exposed to and say, hey, this is a dangerous

1006
01:25:18,860 --> 01:25:23,700
object, you shouldn't be using this. This is not the same thing as this. When you give

1007
01:25:23,700 --> 01:25:31,100
them item A and item B to compare, then I think that that level of exposure is going

1008
01:25:31,100 --> 01:25:36,080
to put it in pretty early. Oh, well, this is not reality. I don't have to be afraid

1009
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:41,760
of this. You know what I mean? And I know a lot of people can distinguish between what's

1010
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:47,980
real and what's not real, even kids, and I think a lot of times they just, that's what

1011
01:25:47,980 --> 01:25:51,020
they blame. You know, if they're not blaming video games for violence, they're blaming

1012
01:25:51,020 --> 01:25:57,100
guns for violence. And it's just, the problem is, no one's ever calling these people out

1013
01:25:57,100 --> 01:26:01,900
and saying, you know, no, like, especially these court cases that go, oh, the video game

1014
01:26:01,900 --> 01:26:06,220
made me do it, and the judge just doesn't go, take some goddamn responsibility for yourself.

1015
01:26:06,220 --> 01:26:10,780
There's a few that have been thrown out, actually, lately, because, um, they, uh, talked it up

1016
01:26:10,780 --> 01:26:15,140
to parental negligence. It'll be interesting to see how the Supreme Court goes on this

1017
01:26:15,140 --> 01:26:20,240
one, though, because it definitely will set a precedent, if nothing else. Well, and, though,

1018
01:26:20,240 --> 01:26:26,740
they're going to have to go by previous precedents, uh, precedent set, like, um, what was that

1019
01:26:26,740 --> 01:26:32,420
public decency, um, thing that ended up being a free speech? You know, there was, in Florida,

1020
01:26:32,420 --> 01:26:38,340
there was, um, there's a boob march every year, and it's allowed to go through as freedom

1021
01:26:38,340 --> 01:26:44,860
of expression. If we can have boobs flapping around in humidity, I think that we can have

1022
01:26:44,860 --> 01:26:51,220
a little, I think we can, I think we can have a little headshot, don't you think? I support

1023
01:26:51,220 --> 01:26:56,940
this, and I think that this should expand across the country. I support, like, why are

1024
01:26:56,940 --> 01:27:00,740
we talking about games? Let's talk more about the boob march. It was, it was something having

1025
01:27:00,740 --> 01:27:06,480
to do with people who, you know, were, had issues with, you know, men being able to walk

1026
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:10,300
without a shirt on and breastfeeding in public and that type of thing. And I agree, it is

1027
01:27:10,300 --> 01:27:14,700
a shame that women do not get to walk. But then again, you know, this is all post-men

1028
01:27:14,700 --> 01:27:21,140
of pause boobs, right? No, lots of young people. Oh really, okay, alright. And for the record,

1029
01:27:21,140 --> 01:27:28,060
when I spawn, I will breastfeed in public. Mental note, don't go out in public with Jamie.

1030
01:27:28,060 --> 01:27:33,780
Hey! I don't wanna see your boobies. That's why they, that's why they make shawls and

1031
01:27:33,780 --> 01:27:38,900
covers, you know. I'm being difficult. No, no, I wanna see, whatever, I don't even go

1032
01:27:38,900 --> 01:27:43,820
in there. She's just like, I don't wanna show you anyway. Alright. My boobs are epic. Moving

1033
01:27:43,820 --> 01:27:48,100
on. We got a lot of show. In the interest of time, we gotta get on release dates. Let's

1034
01:27:48,100 --> 01:27:52,460
talk about what violent games are coming to a store near you this week. Not really. Start

1035
01:27:52,460 --> 01:27:57,940
with the US. Not really many violent games this week, and it's not too much of a release

1036
01:27:57,940 --> 01:28:02,180
week. It is gonna start ramping up though very soon, but there are some decent things.

1037
01:28:02,180 --> 01:28:06,420
There's a re-release of Battlefield Bad Company 2, the Ultimate Edition, with some download

1038
01:28:06,420 --> 01:28:12,900
content there for both Battlefield Bad Company 2 and Battlefield 1943 in there as well. Valkyria

1039
01:28:12,900 --> 01:28:19,220
Chronicles 2 on the PSP. Gunblade New York City and L.A. Machine Guns on the Wii this

1040
01:28:19,220 --> 01:28:28,380
week. Metroid Other M on the Wii this week, which is awesome. Camp Rock the Final Jam

1041
01:28:28,380 --> 01:28:33,140
on the DS, tying in with the movie that's coming out. And I hope they really do mean

1042
01:28:33,140 --> 01:28:38,820
final because I don't care for those Camp Rock games or anything with Disney as far

1043
01:28:38,820 --> 01:28:47,940
as our two shows go. Guilty Party on the Wii. It wants to be Clue, but it's just not. Prison

1044
01:28:47,940 --> 01:28:51,820
Tycoon Alcatraz. I think a lot of this stuff was delayed from last week because I remember

1045
01:28:51,820 --> 01:28:56,780
reading a bunch of this. The Mumbo Jumbo Six Pack 2nd Edition with a bunch of different

1046
01:28:56,780 --> 01:29:05,380
Mumbo Jumbo puzzle and card games in there as well. And what probably is gonna be a really

1047
01:29:05,380 --> 01:29:13,420
shitty game. We wish you a Merry Christmas for the Wii. It's fucking August. I think

1048
01:29:13,420 --> 01:29:19,220
that's a re-release because honestly, yeah, that is a re-release and it's $10 now. And

1049
01:29:19,220 --> 01:29:25,420
trust me, it's not worth $10. That is it. Next week will be some good stuff though.

1050
01:29:25,420 --> 01:29:29,540
Let's go over to Japan and check out what's coming out over there. A lot of price reductions

1051
01:29:29,540 --> 01:29:34,860
this week on the Xbox. Left 4 Dead 2, Halo 3 ODST, Modern Warfare 2 and Bayonetta all

1052
01:29:34,860 --> 01:29:39,300
going into the Platinum Collection over there in Japan. And those are really the only releases

1053
01:29:39,300 --> 01:29:42,340
to look forward to this week. It's kind of a similar situation where we're just kind

1054
01:29:42,340 --> 01:29:47,220
of waiting for the big rush at the end of the year, which will start any day now. Moving

1055
01:29:47,220 --> 01:29:51,460
on to the PlayStation 3, same thing. Lots of price reductions, but that includes NBA

1056
01:29:51,460 --> 01:29:56,500
Live 10, Need for Speed Shift, FIFA Soccer 10, World Class Soccer, Call of Duty Modern

1057
01:29:56,500 --> 01:30:01,900
Warfare 2 and Bayonetta. That's on the PlayStation 3. Again, these are Japanese releases or price

1058
01:30:01,900 --> 01:30:07,340
reductions as the case may be as things move into the Platinum Series over there. Looking

1059
01:30:07,340 --> 01:30:12,620
at the Nintendo Wii, big releases over there this week. Just Metroid Other M gets its release

1060
01:30:12,620 --> 01:30:16,080
on September 2nd, so it's coming out over there this week as well. They didn't really

1061
01:30:16,080 --> 01:30:19,740
get it earlier or later. Just a couple days later I guess if we want to be technical.

1062
01:30:19,740 --> 01:30:24,940
PlayStation 2 doesn't have a whole lot going on. There is a new FIFA Soccer 10 coming out

1063
01:30:24,940 --> 01:30:30,180
there and Shin Sangoku Musou 5 Special gets a price reduction if you're into that.

1064
01:30:30,180 --> 01:30:35,940
I have to add something real quick here. I just noticed this on the Kotaku release list,

1065
01:30:35,940 --> 01:30:43,500
which I believe is from GameSpot. I'm assuming this is a download title. Well, actually I'm

1066
01:30:43,500 --> 01:30:47,700
pretty positive this is a download title, but it's awesome. Cthulhu Saves the World

1067
01:30:47,700 --> 01:30:52,820
on Xbox 360. There are so many things wrong with that because Cthulhu never really saves

1068
01:30:52,820 --> 01:31:00,340
anything unless it's saving by cleansing all humanity off of the world. But maybe that's

1069
01:31:00,340 --> 01:31:05,380
coming out on 360 this week. Maybe an Xbox Live Arcade game? I don't know. Who knows?

1070
01:31:05,380 --> 01:31:06,380
That's an awesome name.

1071
01:31:06,380 --> 01:31:13,860
Alright, also in Japan this week on the Nintendo DS, a game called Nintama Rantaru Gakunin

1072
01:31:13,860 --> 01:31:19,580
Taikosuan Puzzle No Dawn comes out this week. Basically it's a puzzle game with chibi little

1073
01:31:19,580 --> 01:31:25,220
characters. It looks like a lot of twin type characters or characters in teams. So it almost

1074
01:31:25,220 --> 01:31:29,740
looks like an amazing race puzzle game with chibi characters? Maybe not.

1075
01:31:29,740 --> 01:31:33,900
Then lastly, going on to the Sony PSP and seeing if anything is coming out over there

1076
01:31:33,900 --> 01:31:39,460
worth mentioning. Bleach Heat the Soul 7 because you know you've missed your Bleach games.

1077
01:31:39,460 --> 01:31:43,220
There's another one coming out on PSP this week. Also a game called White Breath Perfect

1078
01:31:43,220 --> 01:31:51,140
Edition comes out this week as well on the PSP. It's called White Breath. It is an adventure

1079
01:31:51,140 --> 01:31:54,940
game. Trying to figure out if it's a dating sim or what. It's another one of those kind

1080
01:31:54,940 --> 01:32:00,620
of like read and respond to the characters as they're talking to you. There's so many

1081
01:32:00,620 --> 01:32:03,860
Japanese games that look like this. But you can choose. It looks like there's a music

1082
01:32:03,860 --> 01:32:07,620
mode. There's a music song called Slapstick. Yeah, whatever. There you go. Those are your

1083
01:32:07,620 --> 01:32:10,660
releases in Japan this week. How about Europe?

1084
01:32:10,660 --> 01:32:17,980
We do have some goodies in Europe. On the 31st Bioshock 2 Minerva's Den on PS3, PC,

1085
01:32:17,980 --> 01:32:27,060
Xbox 360. Dead Rising 2 Case 0 on Xbox 360. On September 3rd we have Metroid Other M and

1086
01:32:27,060 --> 01:32:34,100
Tom Clancy's Hawk 2 and Valkyria Chronicles. So that's going to be a week of excitement.

1087
01:32:34,100 --> 01:32:42,020
Alright, just a few more news stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week.

1088
01:32:42,020 --> 01:32:47,780
Alright. Let's see, there's some other cool stuff here. It's interesting, this week there

1089
01:32:47,780 --> 01:32:54,300
was a lot of talk about used game stuff. Despite the fact, you know, THQ thinks you're all

1090
01:32:54,300 --> 01:33:00,780
cheaters for buying used games. But apparently some of their direct customers are going to

1091
01:33:00,780 --> 01:33:07,620
be cheaters as well. Target is actually buying used games. They started their used game buying

1092
01:33:07,620 --> 01:33:13,780
program. It's actually kind of taking place right now in Northern California. But they're

1093
01:33:13,780 --> 01:33:20,660
going to be rolling out 850 stores by the year's end. I'm not really sure how that program

1094
01:33:20,660 --> 01:33:27,620
works but that'll be interesting. I guess you can trade in games for store credit there.

1095
01:33:27,620 --> 01:33:35,780
I wonder what the trade in rate will be like. And then of course, to go with that, Best

1096
01:33:35,780 --> 01:33:41,300
Buy. They've been rumored to be mulling over a trade in program. In fact they had those

1097
01:33:41,300 --> 01:33:48,340
kiosks at one point. Well now they've actually begun doing used game trade ins as well. And

1098
01:33:48,340 --> 01:33:57,900
they also have, I guess, $20 gift cards for select titles. If you trade in a certain game

1099
01:33:57,900 --> 01:34:08,420
they'll give you $20, I guess, addition. Oh, I guess they'll give you $20 instead of the

1100
01:34:08,420 --> 01:34:17,340
titles trade in volume. But hey, $20 for games sometimes is pretty good. So yeah, it's interesting.

1101
01:34:17,340 --> 01:34:21,740
So I'm sure if these guys start doing this that probably other retailers, especially

1102
01:34:21,740 --> 01:34:27,500
if they're successful with it, won't be too far behind. And then everybody will be cheaters.

1103
01:34:27,500 --> 01:34:39,900
What will you think then, THQ? I think they'll probably poop themselves. Anybody planning

1104
01:34:39,900 --> 01:34:45,100
to take advantage of these programs? No, not really. I like the idea that I can take old

1105
01:34:45,100 --> 01:34:51,180
video games and turn them in at Target and turn them around and buy new shoes or a loaf

1106
01:34:51,180 --> 01:34:57,220
of bread. Yeah, nice. Alright, one more story for this half of the show and it's about the

1107
01:34:57,220 --> 01:35:03,460
Silver Lining. Remember that was the King's Quest fan game that had some problems legally

1108
01:35:03,460 --> 01:35:07,700
and then finally they were able to release it. Hooray and it was free. Double hooray.

1109
01:35:07,700 --> 01:35:12,140
Well it's in chapters and the next chapter is out in September. That's when it's coming

1110
01:35:12,140 --> 01:35:16,580
out and that's from the Phoenix Games who made the site. I love that name for that game

1111
01:35:16,580 --> 01:35:20,420
company because they've been through so much crap. And it's over in a post on their site.

1112
01:35:20,420 --> 01:35:24,940
It is coming out in September. Hey, that's really soon. No word on when in September

1113
01:35:24,940 --> 01:35:29,980
but there you go. The name of the game, it's called Episode 2, Two Households. They're

1114
01:35:29,980 --> 01:35:34,500
saying it will have better pathfinding, the option to switch between extended and short

1115
01:35:34,500 --> 01:35:40,340
narration, a new walking animation, more subtitle options, and widescreen support. So I guess

1116
01:35:40,340 --> 01:35:43,340
it sounds like they've taken a lot of feedback from the first game and implemented it. So

1117
01:35:43,340 --> 01:35:50,500
that's really cool. In a related story, the website GOG.com, G-O-G.com or goodollegames.com,

1118
01:35:50,500 --> 01:35:55,300
they're having a King's Quest 1 through 3 bundle selling right now for $9.99. There's

1119
01:35:55,300 --> 01:36:00,300
also a pack with 4, 5, and 6 with the same price. You ever looked at GOG.com? They actually

1120
01:36:00,300 --> 01:36:06,380
have quite a few old, old games for sale on there. And a good way to get legitimate what

1121
01:36:06,380 --> 01:36:11,460
they, I've seen called Abandonware before when people just put up old games because

1122
01:36:11,460 --> 01:36:16,180
they say it's old, no one cares about it anymore. As long as it's not Game.com. No, it's not

1123
01:36:16,180 --> 01:36:20,220
that. I had one of those and the Taco and got rid of them both. You had an N-Gage really?

1124
01:36:20,220 --> 01:36:25,580
Yes, I did. Oh my god. I brought it, Rob, I brought it with me to E3 one year. Clearly

1125
01:36:25,580 --> 01:36:30,120
I've erased it from my memory and can you blame me? And I'm glad that you know exactly

1126
01:36:30,120 --> 01:36:35,820
what I was talking about when I said Taco. Well, what other gaming devices look like

1127
01:36:35,820 --> 01:36:43,060
a taco? Alright, speaking of stuff in gaming's history, let's take a walk down gaming history

1128
01:36:43,060 --> 01:36:48,400
lane and review the classic game of the week. Every week Dark Sakura likes to step into

1129
01:36:48,400 --> 01:36:52,820
the vault, or her living room as the case may be, and pull out a classic game that she

1130
01:36:52,820 --> 01:36:59,540
says, hey, you little brats, you should be playing this game. So Dark Sakura, what is

1131
01:36:59,540 --> 01:37:03,700
the classic game of the week this week? The classic game is Zillion for the Sega Master

1132
01:37:03,700 --> 01:37:14,100
System. Yay! Now you gotta do something, Rob. What? Let's play this for a second. This is

1133
01:37:14,100 --> 01:37:18,980
the theme music from the game. Okay. Now play the theme music from the anime. Play the theme

1134
01:37:18,980 --> 01:37:29,020
music from the anime. I can do that. Okay. I'm prepared here for a change. That's actually

1135
01:37:29,020 --> 01:37:36,380
one of the best qualities I have that I can play. Now, does the gun look familiar? Yes,

1136
01:37:36,380 --> 01:37:39,660
the gun does look familiar, wow. You can link that in the chat room. Sure, I'll link this

1137
01:37:39,660 --> 01:37:46,900
in the chat room. Okay. The game and the anime Zillion came out as companions to each other.

1138
01:37:46,900 --> 01:37:51,620
I'm gonna switch and do some play of the game, sorry, didn't mean to cut you off. That's

1139
01:37:51,620 --> 01:38:00,820
pretty cool. The game actually in Japan, its full name is Akai Kodan Zillion, which is

1140
01:38:00,820 --> 01:38:08,580
Red Photon Zillion. And it kind of is Metroid-ish. It came out though before then, I believe.

1141
01:38:08,580 --> 01:38:14,540
It was out in 1987 for the Sega Master System. And there was a sequel called Zillion II,

1142
01:38:14,540 --> 01:38:23,660
the Triformation. It also had things in common with Impossible Mission too. Basically, the

1143
01:38:23,660 --> 01:38:28,940
general story, you play a group called the White Knights and you have to go get rid of

1144
01:38:28,940 --> 01:38:35,180
this base on Planet X. So you play the main dude, JJ, and you rescue Apple and Champ,

1145
01:38:35,180 --> 01:38:39,660
who are the other guys. Keep in mind, early anime. Just real quick, don't want to cut

1146
01:38:39,660 --> 01:38:45,620
you off, but since you brought it up, August 6th, 1986 was Metroid. Okay, so then it was

1147
01:38:45,620 --> 01:38:54,020
afterwards. Alright. Anyway, you have to go past tripwires, turrets, force fields, a bunch

1148
01:38:54,020 --> 01:38:59,620
of enemy guards. Including in some places, they kind of run in, like Metal Gear style.

1149
01:38:59,620 --> 01:39:07,140
The little alert noise, so it's pretty cool. You carry a little gun with you and if those

1150
01:39:07,140 --> 01:39:12,660
and chat room are checking it out, the gun is the same design, it's the design for the

1151
01:39:12,660 --> 01:39:18,900
Sega Master System light phaser. Um, and of course you gain levels for your guns and then

1152
01:39:18,900 --> 01:39:23,860
you can rescue, like I said, Apple and Champ and they have, Apple is fast but weak, Champ

1153
01:39:23,860 --> 01:39:29,160
is slow and strong and JJ is like a nice balance in between them. There's also a glitch in

1154
01:39:29,160 --> 01:39:36,160
the game that you can become invincible by dying when you go into a room to room elevator.

1155
01:39:36,160 --> 01:39:41,680
Um, but you can't go to your status menu. Um, the only way you can switch characters is

1156
01:39:41,680 --> 01:39:46,360
when you find a new teammate. Um, and of course, you know, remember this is the Master System,

1157
01:39:46,360 --> 01:39:51,880
it is kind of inconvenient to go pause your game on the system like it was back in the

1158
01:39:51,880 --> 01:39:58,880
day. Um, but the, uh, the music, uh, is, uh, of course a lot the same music from the, uh,

1159
01:39:58,880 --> 01:40:04,880
the anime. Um, and the one where you go in and out of their main ship, it plays the opening

1160
01:40:04,880 --> 01:40:11,280
theme from the anime. And it plays it when the Sega label goes off. And then, um, it's,

1161
01:40:11,280 --> 01:40:16,080
it's pretty cool. It's got an actual soundtrack called Akai Kodan Zillion Let It Rock, which

1162
01:40:16,080 --> 01:40:23,080
I have, just saying. And the anime's pretty good too, actually. Um, but the game is, uh,

1163
01:40:23,080 --> 01:40:29,080
it's got a lot of, uh, you know, different special messages in it. And you have, the

1164
01:40:29,080 --> 01:40:32,080
way that you go through those rooms is that you have these little pods that you have to

1165
01:40:32,080 --> 01:40:35,480
blow up and get a character out of. And then you put them into a computer. And the characters

1166
01:40:35,480 --> 01:40:40,280
don't have to be in any particular order, by the way. Um, and then you get, like, some

1167
01:40:40,280 --> 01:40:45,080
special codes that will summon, you know, like, will turn off the tripwires or something.

1168
01:40:45,080 --> 01:40:50,080
And they do other stuff. This more reminds me of Impossible Mission. That's what I love

1169
01:40:50,080 --> 01:40:54,080
said earlier. I said that it has a lot in common with Impossible Mission. Yeah, yeah.

1170
01:40:54,080 --> 01:41:00,080
But... Just having looked at this for a little bit now, yeah. But keep in mind, this is,

1171
01:41:00,080 --> 01:41:06,080
this is a pretty, pretty sweet game. And it doesn't have a save function, sadly. Dan left

1172
01:41:06,080 --> 01:41:13,080
his game paused while he was playing it for hours on end so he could do other stuff. But

1173
01:41:13,080 --> 01:41:17,080
I'd have to say, it's among the list of, you know, one of my favorite things about this

1174
01:41:17,080 --> 01:41:26,080
game. And also keep in mind, there's a little guest star in Zillion. There's the Oppa Oppa.

1175
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:34,080
Really? When you're, cause you can shoot different of those little, you know, pods and get power-ups

1176
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:40,080
and one of your power-ups is an Oppa Oppa and it gives you a level up. And it's just

1177
01:41:40,080 --> 01:41:47,080
a little icon of an Oppa Oppa. Well, I think this is alternate audio. I don't think that's

1178
01:41:47,080 --> 01:41:50,080
actually the game. Yeah, that one, if this one I'm thinking of that is. They said they

1179
01:41:50,080 --> 01:41:59,080
unsynced and had to use different music. Dope. But yeah, um, if you watch the anime too,

1180
01:41:59,080 --> 01:42:04,080
there's little scenes where the Oppa Oppa is hanging out with them. Some little references.

1181
01:42:04,080 --> 01:42:09,080
Fantasy Zone. Awesome. And of course we know what Fantasy Zone also had to do with,

1182
01:42:09,080 --> 01:42:15,080
Space Harrier. Maybe we should have Seven Degrees of Space Harrier. Could be a new game

1183
01:42:15,080 --> 01:42:19,080
to play. Yeah. Alright, well there it is, your classic game of the week, Zillion for

1184
01:42:19,080 --> 01:42:25,080
the Sega Master System. Go play it. It's fun. Alright. We'll see what she picks next week

1185
01:42:25,080 --> 01:42:29,080
cause you still get one for the marathon show. So, and now, then we might have to actually

1186
01:42:29,080 --> 01:42:33,080
play it. I think we should. We'll see. I'm gonna dig into the closet and go obscure.

1187
01:42:33,080 --> 01:42:39,080
Better not suck. That's all I'm saying. Alright. We're gonna take a quick break here at Orange

1188
01:42:39,080 --> 01:42:42,080
Lounge Radio. Just for that I'm gonna make Rob play through Bongio by himself on One

1189
01:42:42,080 --> 01:42:46,080
Man. Why? Why would you do that? Alright. Alright. We're gonna take a quick break here

1190
01:42:46,080 --> 01:42:50,080
at Orange Lounge Radio but don't go anywhere. We will be right back with plenty more news

1191
01:42:50,080 --> 01:42:54,080
stories. We got your Twitter topics coming too so make sure you get those in on Twitter.

1192
01:42:54,080 --> 01:43:05,080
Your emails and phone calls all when we get back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1193
01:43:05,080 --> 01:43:10,080
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio. We are taping live on this Sunday evening,

1194
01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:17,080
August the 29th of 2010. It is the 379th episode of our show and lots of folks in our chat

1195
01:43:17,080 --> 01:43:21,080
room talking about the upcoming marathon last week. Some folks asking, Robert M. is asking

1196
01:43:21,080 --> 01:43:25,080
in chat, any chance of the marathon being on the podcast or would there be licensed

1197
01:43:25,080 --> 01:43:30,080
music being used? Right now I don't see why it wouldn't be podcast. I mean I guess it

1198
01:43:30,080 --> 01:43:35,080
depends on what happens and the legality of what happens. But I don't see why not. It

1199
01:43:35,080 --> 01:43:39,080
will probably be labeled separately so that those folks, you know, because not everybody

1200
01:43:39,080 --> 01:43:43,080
is gonna want to hear. Because it's gonna have a different flow. It's not gonna be as,

1201
01:43:43,080 --> 01:43:50,080
dare I say it, polished as this show is. Which you know is gonna be really bad. But you know

1202
01:43:50,080 --> 01:43:54,080
I'm gonna label it differently. But it will be there for folks to download. But those

1203
01:43:54,080 --> 01:43:58,080
folks that aren't really interested in the excess will be able to just get the regular

1204
01:43:58,080 --> 01:44:03,080
3 hour show and move on with it. But yeah that's what we're aiming for right now anyway.

1205
01:44:03,080 --> 01:44:08,080
We'll let you know for sure of course after we tape next week. Anyhow we've got more

1206
01:44:08,080 --> 01:44:12,080
news to get into. And of course we're gonna get your Twitter topics here in just a minute.

1207
01:44:12,080 --> 01:44:16,080
And the FUs of the week, the mailbag, all those fun segments. Phone calls coming up

1208
01:44:16,080 --> 01:44:21,080
too. But first, quick quick quick news. And things, there's just so much to talk about

1209
01:44:21,080 --> 01:44:25,080
this week. We just don't have time to spend 10 minutes on everything. But Loki what do

1210
01:44:25,080 --> 01:44:29,080
we want to talk about quickly? This is Vegas. It's apparently cancelled. It was a game

1211
01:44:29,080 --> 01:44:34,080
that was being developed by Surreal Software for Midway. But of course when Midway

1212
01:44:34,080 --> 01:44:39,080
closed down it was then bought up by Warner Brothers Interactive. The premise of the game

1213
01:44:39,080 --> 01:44:44,080
was retarded as it was. It's basically you going to Vegas, dancing, driving fast cars,

1214
01:44:44,080 --> 01:44:51,080
punching people, and gambling. And apparently the game is rumored to have cost 43 million

1215
01:44:51,080 --> 01:44:59,080
dollars to make. Wow what a waste of money that was. But no confirmation whether it's

1216
01:44:59,080 --> 01:45:05,080
coming, it's actually cancelled or not but who gives a crap. What are you talking about?

1217
01:45:05,080 --> 01:45:10,080
That's what I do every time I go visit Tara. Exactly. Gamble and punch people. Why would

1218
01:45:10,080 --> 01:45:16,080
you want to play a game that do that? I just don't understand. The homebrew channel, it's

1219
01:45:16,080 --> 01:45:23,080
been something that's been kind of a staple of the homebrew community on the Wii for

1220
01:45:23,080 --> 01:45:32,080
quite a while now. Since the release of homebrew channel version 1.07 they have added

1221
01:45:32,080 --> 01:45:41,080
anonymous user statistics to the homebrew channel installations as well. And apparently

1222
01:45:41,080 --> 01:45:49,080
they have detected about 200,000 people using the homebrew channel on the Wii. So that's

1223
01:45:49,080 --> 01:45:55,080
kind of cool. And unsurprisingly I guess the top country using this would be the USA

1224
01:45:55,080 --> 01:46:06,080
followed by France, Germany, Spain, and the Great Britain. And it's interesting though

1225
01:46:06,080 --> 01:46:12,080
that with that many systems out there there's not really a lot of people that use kind of

1226
01:46:12,080 --> 01:46:19,080
the homebrew channel for stuff. So maybe the hacking and piracy stuff on the Wii isn't

1227
01:46:19,080 --> 01:46:25,080
as prevalent as they think it is. Of course there's other methods for that but it's

1228
01:46:25,080 --> 01:46:33,080
interesting nonetheless. And finally a unique MMO has been announced called Dead State.

1229
01:46:33,080 --> 01:46:41,080
It is possibly the first zombie RPG that's available as an MMO. It's coming from a

1230
01:46:41,080 --> 01:46:49,080
company called Double Bear, which is better than a single bear. And I guess that developer

1231
01:46:49,080 --> 01:46:59,080
is composed of Bethesda and Troika Vets. They've come up with this new RPG set in a

1232
01:46:59,080 --> 01:47:07,080
fictional town called Splendid, Texas. Which is in the grips of a full on zombie

1233
01:47:07,080 --> 01:47:14,080
apocalypse. And the object is to keep yourself alive. And I guess you operate out of a

1234
01:47:14,080 --> 01:47:20,080
local school which serves as a hub and sanctuary from the horrors of the community.

1235
01:47:20,080 --> 01:47:26,080
And from there you must head out into the wild hunting down supplies and other survivors.

1236
01:47:26,080 --> 01:47:34,080
And of course using those resources to beef up your base there. And of course there's

1237
01:47:34,080 --> 01:47:40,080
tons of zombies and not everybody that you find will be friendly or sane for that matter.

1238
01:47:40,080 --> 01:47:45,080
And combat is supposed to be turn based and you'll be able to issue commands to whole

1239
01:47:45,080 --> 01:47:53,080
groups or individuals as well. So that's supposed to be headed out on a PC sometime

1240
01:47:53,080 --> 01:47:56,080
I guess relatively soon.

1241
01:47:56,080 --> 01:47:59,080
Taking a step backward here real quick in chat, but it's a good chat comment. Tiger

1242
01:47:59,080 --> 01:48:03,080
Claw in our chat says, and those who pirate games, some people have been playing Metroid

1243
01:48:03,080 --> 01:48:08,080
Other M on Justin TV. And I noticed one playing a pirated version that was loaded from

1244
01:48:08,080 --> 01:48:10,080
the homebrew channel.

1245
01:48:10,080 --> 01:48:15,080
I'm sure there are. It's been leaked out since last week so I wouldn't be surprised.

1246
01:48:15,080 --> 01:48:20,080
Yikes. Alright well moving on to some other quick news here. I'm talking about another

1247
01:48:20,080 --> 01:48:25,080
game coming out from Sony. It's up on PlayStation Japan. There's apparently a teaser

1248
01:48:25,080 --> 01:48:31,080
page. And on this page you see this Japanese guy sitting in a tuxedo and it looks like

1249
01:48:31,080 --> 01:48:33,080
he's knitting.

1250
01:48:33,080 --> 01:48:35,080
It looks like the Godfather.

1251
01:48:35,080 --> 01:48:40,080
It is what it looks like but it's on PlayStation Japan and EA owns the rights to the Godfather

1252
01:48:40,080 --> 01:48:42,080
but the Godfather is knitting.

1253
01:48:42,080 --> 01:48:45,080
It's for LittleBigPlanet 2.

1254
01:48:45,080 --> 01:48:46,080
You think?

1255
01:48:46,080 --> 01:48:48,080
No it's been confirmed that's what it's for.

1256
01:48:48,080 --> 01:48:49,080
Interesting.

1257
01:48:49,080 --> 01:48:54,080
Because he's crocheting a sack boy. But it's just funny because if you actually go to the

1258
01:48:54,080 --> 01:48:57,080
page there's an animation of him crocheting.

1259
01:48:57,080 --> 01:48:58,080
Cute.

1260
01:48:58,080 --> 01:49:03,080
Alright I get it. That's funny. Alright. Also some updates on I made a game with

1261
01:49:03,080 --> 01:49:07,080
Jambi Jinich. See when people speak and leads speak that's how I say it. I made a game

1262
01:49:07,080 --> 01:49:09,080
with Jambi Jinich.

1263
01:49:09,080 --> 01:49:13,080
Because they use three for E and one for I and all that stuff.

1264
01:49:13,080 --> 01:49:15,080
So yeah.

1265
01:49:15,080 --> 01:49:20,080
Apparently I made a game with Jambi Jinich. It has sold over 300,000 copies.

1266
01:49:20,080 --> 01:49:22,080
That's a lot for an indie game.

1267
01:49:22,080 --> 01:49:24,080
A lot a lot of games.

1268
01:49:24,080 --> 01:49:30,080
Also the theme song to Jambi's is now available on Rock Band Network.

1269
01:49:30,080 --> 01:49:36,080
Also if that wasn't enough you're soon going to be able to get Jambi's shirts and Hot Topic.

1270
01:49:36,080 --> 01:49:39,080
Because you know Hot Topic loves to get in on that trendy stuff.

1271
01:49:39,080 --> 01:49:45,080
And I love this shirt here. It just says Jambi's with a big exclamation exclamation one.

1272
01:49:45,080 --> 01:49:47,080
There you go.

1273
01:49:47,080 --> 01:49:56,080
Also real quickly some music game news updates. BeatMania 2DX 18 called Resort Anthem.

1274
01:49:56,080 --> 01:49:58,080
I know right. I'm like wow they got four.

1275
01:49:58,080 --> 01:49:59,080
Resort Anthem. It doesn't matter what it's called.

1276
01:49:59,080 --> 01:50:03,080
2DX Sports Resort. It will always be 18th style to me.

1277
01:50:03,080 --> 01:50:06,080
But Resort Anthem has a release date at September 15th.

1278
01:50:06,080 --> 01:50:10,080
There you go. And all those no arcades that will import that here in the US.

1279
01:50:10,080 --> 01:50:16,080
And then lastly DDRX2 is going to be location tested very soon in Joy-Z.

1280
01:50:16,080 --> 01:50:20,080
I don't have the specifics on where. I'm hoping someone here in chat room can fill me in.

1281
01:50:20,080 --> 01:50:24,080
Unfortunately my little newsy link is... Oh there we go. On the border with lots of skee-ball.

1282
01:50:24,080 --> 01:50:30,080
It wasn't working a minute ago. No it actually is going to be at Funplex in East Hanover, New Jersey.

1283
01:50:30,080 --> 01:50:36,080
That's where it's at. Enjoy if you live in Joy-Z or nearby.

1284
01:50:36,080 --> 01:50:39,080
Go play some X2 and let us know what you think. Dark Sakura.

1285
01:50:39,080 --> 01:50:42,080
I got your news right here.

1286
01:50:42,080 --> 01:50:49,080
Well there's a rumor going that for Marvel vs. Capcom 3 that Crimson Viper is going to be a character in it.

1287
01:50:49,080 --> 01:50:57,080
But I think it's looking at this outline in the way that they have it done on the site.

1288
01:50:57,080 --> 01:51:05,080
That I think it's actually very likely Crimson Viper. They just masked her out and showed the silhouette and it fits perfectly.

1289
01:51:05,080 --> 01:51:12,080
She's cheap. Why put her in the game?

1290
01:51:12,080 --> 01:51:17,080
Why do people hate her so much? I was reading the comments on that site and there's a lot of hate for Crimson Viper.

1291
01:51:17,080 --> 01:51:18,080
She's a cheap whore.

1292
01:51:18,080 --> 01:51:22,080
Well a lot of characters in Street Fighter are cheap whores. That's what the game's all about.

1293
01:51:22,080 --> 01:51:23,080
She's a masher's paradise.

1294
01:51:23,080 --> 01:51:25,080
Sounds good to me.

1295
01:51:25,080 --> 01:51:26,080
She's Eddie Gordo.

1296
01:51:26,080 --> 01:51:29,080
I used to love Eddie Gordo in Tekken 3.

1297
01:51:29,080 --> 01:51:30,080
Masher.

1298
01:51:30,080 --> 01:51:31,080
And what? And what?

1299
01:51:31,080 --> 01:51:38,080
So what are you going to do when you have Tekken vs. Street Fighter or whatever and you can do Eddie Gordo vs. Crimson Viper?

1300
01:51:38,080 --> 01:51:41,080
What he said.

1301
01:51:41,080 --> 01:51:47,080
It's like, mash mash mash mash, switch, mash mash mash, switch.

1302
01:51:47,080 --> 01:51:52,080
All the buttons on my controller break within a week. How did this happen?

1303
01:51:52,080 --> 01:51:56,080
What did you do that for? Well how about something for a different game?

1304
01:51:56,080 --> 01:52:01,080
I don't know when I started talking in Leetspeak. How did this happen?

1305
01:52:01,080 --> 01:52:08,080
Crackdown 2, Rob. Crackdown 2. A.K.A. I like jumping the sequel.

1306
01:52:08,080 --> 01:52:16,080
Basically the new download content is going to be, it's called Toy Box.

1307
01:52:16,080 --> 01:52:28,080
And it's a free, there's a free version that will have one called Keys to the City, which is an unlock, and the thruster ability, which is jet packs for your boot and vehicle tag.

1308
01:52:28,080 --> 01:52:38,080
And then if you pay the 560 Microsoft points, then you'll get 5 new weapons, 2 new vehicles, a couple of avatar items, 10 new cheevos.

1309
01:52:38,080 --> 01:52:41,080
So, according to this, I guess that means achievement, huh?

1310
01:52:41,080 --> 01:52:42,080
Mhm.

1311
01:52:42,080 --> 01:52:48,080
I think that's a stupid word. It makes me think of cheetos, and now I want some.

1312
01:52:48,080 --> 01:52:53,080
Why have cheetos when you can have those, like, knockoff cheetos that are like the cheesy poops?

1313
01:52:53,080 --> 01:52:55,080
Like there's much more. Cheese puffs.

1314
01:52:55,080 --> 01:53:02,080
Cheese puffs or whatever. They sell them in big ol' bags at Trader Joe's. They're just, they're still cheesy, but they're more puffy.

1315
01:53:02,080 --> 01:53:04,080
And they make me more puffy when I eat them.

1316
01:53:04,080 --> 01:53:05,080
How about something else?

1317
01:53:05,080 --> 01:53:07,080
How about it?

1318
01:53:07,080 --> 01:53:22,080
Oh, wait, wait. I want to say real quick. If Microsoft knew what they were doing, they would release download content for, I don't know, 400 points, 800 points, that would allow you to go into the arena with the announcer and flamethrower him to death.

1319
01:53:22,080 --> 01:53:26,080
And then they'll talk and announce about how he's dying. And why would you want to kill me?

1320
01:53:26,080 --> 01:53:32,080
I've got a wife and family, peacekeeper, or whatever, agent.

1321
01:53:32,080 --> 01:53:35,080
You can bite my butt, boss.

1322
01:53:35,080 --> 01:53:36,080
You know.

1323
01:53:36,080 --> 01:53:37,080
Anyway.

1324
01:53:37,080 --> 01:53:47,080
It's Robert Stack, okay? They somehow have downloaded his consciousness into the game, and that's who I picture talking to me, and it makes me all warm and fuzzy inside.

1325
01:53:47,080 --> 01:53:50,080
Yeah, but you said Robert Stack, and I think Ultra Magnus.

1326
01:53:50,080 --> 01:53:56,080
Because Transformers the movie was awesome. Not the new ones! The old school, animated.

1327
01:53:56,080 --> 01:54:00,080
Anyway, um, but we need sad music, Rob. We need really sad music.

1328
01:54:00,080 --> 01:54:03,080
Um, okay, hold on. Let me get you some sad music.

1329
01:54:03,080 --> 01:54:05,080
Or maybe like some Sanctus or something.

1330
01:54:05,080 --> 01:54:07,080
Can you fill time while I get you sad music?

1331
01:54:07,080 --> 01:54:10,080
Well, I know this is supposed to be like a little quick segment.

1332
01:54:10,080 --> 01:54:11,080
I made a game with...

1333
01:54:11,080 --> 01:54:16,080
Hold on, hold on, here's your sad music.

1334
01:54:16,080 --> 01:54:18,080
Come on, work.

1335
01:54:21,080 --> 01:54:22,080
Oh wait.

1336
01:54:22,080 --> 01:54:25,080
Sorry, I got the B-52's funplex.

1337
01:54:25,080 --> 01:54:28,080
I was thinking funplex earlier, I know.

1338
01:54:28,080 --> 01:54:31,080
I got the song for the other story mixed up. Oh well, make it work.

1339
01:54:31,080 --> 01:54:35,080
You can just play this.

1340
01:54:35,080 --> 01:54:41,080
We have to say rest in peace to a company who has brought us a bunch of games.

1341
01:54:41,080 --> 01:54:46,080
They brought us Space Jam.

1342
01:54:46,080 --> 01:54:51,080
They brought us Burnout.

1343
01:54:51,080 --> 01:54:57,080
Bye, Acclaim! Acclaim is going down.

1344
01:54:57,080 --> 01:54:59,080
I thought they'd been down for a while.

1345
01:54:59,080 --> 01:55:01,080
I'm going down now.

1346
01:55:04,080 --> 01:55:06,080
It's just fun.

1347
01:55:11,080 --> 01:55:15,080
Rob, you are a sick puppy.

1348
01:55:15,080 --> 01:55:18,080
Sick puppy!

1349
01:55:18,080 --> 01:55:20,080
Sorry, Acclaim.

1350
01:55:20,080 --> 01:55:27,080
Well, yeah, basically the deal is that Howard Marks bought the name

1351
01:55:27,080 --> 01:55:31,080
and tried to reboot it as a free-to-play games portal.

1352
01:55:31,080 --> 01:55:32,080
It was terrible.

1353
01:55:32,080 --> 01:55:34,080
Yeah, in Crash and Burn.

1354
01:55:34,080 --> 01:55:37,080
I think you can go to the site and get refunds.

1355
01:55:37,080 --> 01:55:39,080
Anyway.

1356
01:55:39,080 --> 01:55:42,080
What was the last big thing Acclaim did?

1357
01:55:42,080 --> 01:55:44,080
I haven't seen that name since...

1358
01:55:44,080 --> 01:55:45,080
Gosh.

1359
01:55:45,080 --> 01:55:47,080
Welcome to NBA Jam.

1360
01:55:47,080 --> 01:55:48,080
Didn't they do Double Dragon?

1361
01:55:48,080 --> 01:55:49,080
Okay, NBA Jam.

1362
01:55:49,080 --> 01:55:52,080
I was going to say Double Dragon 2 on the NES, I think it was then.

1363
01:55:52,080 --> 01:55:53,080
Yeah.

1364
01:55:53,080 --> 01:55:57,080
But even NBA Jam, though, the last system it was out was...

1365
01:55:57,080 --> 01:55:59,080
I think it was...

1366
01:55:59,080 --> 01:56:03,080
Other than the download versions, they did one on the PlayStation.

1367
01:56:03,080 --> 01:56:05,080
Well, they did. You're right.

1368
01:56:05,080 --> 01:56:09,080
Yeah, that we've been looking for that isn't the other version.

1369
01:56:09,080 --> 01:56:12,080
Thank you, Rama. Acclaim did BMX XXX.

1370
01:56:12,080 --> 01:56:13,080
That was Acclaim.

1371
01:56:13,080 --> 01:56:16,080
I think that was the first foot in the grave.

1372
01:56:16,080 --> 01:56:18,080
What a fine piece of gaming history that game is.

1373
01:56:18,080 --> 01:56:19,080
I thought that was mid...

1374
01:56:19,080 --> 01:56:21,080
Yeah, I guess it was Acclaim.

1375
01:56:21,080 --> 01:56:23,080
It was a fun game, okay?

1376
01:56:23,080 --> 01:56:25,080
It was fun.

1377
01:56:25,080 --> 01:56:26,080
Alright, let's move on, guys.

1378
01:56:26,080 --> 01:56:29,080
It was kind of cool dragging a hoe around on your bike.

1379
01:56:29,080 --> 01:56:32,080
As in a BMX bike.

1380
01:56:32,080 --> 01:56:38,080
Wow, let's get into some Twitter topics!

1381
01:56:38,080 --> 01:56:43,080
Every week you guys send us your tweets at twitter.com slash O-L-R.

1382
01:56:43,080 --> 01:56:45,080
Let's read some of them tweets.

1383
01:56:45,080 --> 01:56:47,080
Lots of tweets from DJ Blazkin.

1384
01:56:47,080 --> 01:56:51,080
I can't read all of these because some of these are coming up later in the show.

1385
01:56:51,080 --> 01:56:53,080
Besides, we have a two tweet limit.

1386
01:56:53,080 --> 01:56:55,080
You're getting greedy with the tweets.

1387
01:56:55,080 --> 01:56:57,080
DJ Blazkin is announcing this.

1388
01:56:57,080 --> 01:57:01,080
I read this earlier in the week and I think this is worth reading.

1389
01:57:01,080 --> 01:57:04,080
G4 has announced, according to DJ Blazkin here in this news story,

1390
01:57:04,080 --> 01:57:08,080
a new show called Bomb Patrol Afghanistan.

1391
01:57:08,080 --> 01:57:09,080
Have you heard about this?

1392
01:57:09,080 --> 01:57:14,080
This is the show on G4, which I don't know why we're reporting on this on the show.

1393
01:57:14,080 --> 01:57:17,080
I think we banned G4 news from the show a while ago, but oh well, moment of weakness.

1394
01:57:17,080 --> 01:57:20,080
They've made a show out of The Hurt Locker.

1395
01:57:20,080 --> 01:57:22,080
Yeah, the one that won the Oscar.

1396
01:57:22,080 --> 01:57:25,080
Yeah, apparently it is Bomb Patrol Afghanistan.

1397
01:57:25,080 --> 01:57:29,080
It's a new series about real life soldiers who put their lives on the line every day

1398
01:57:29,080 --> 01:57:32,080
as members of the Explosive Ordnance Disposal.

1399
01:57:32,080 --> 01:57:37,080
The show will follow the lives of the EOD team both at home and in Afghanistan.

1400
01:57:37,080 --> 01:57:41,080
You know what? All things considered, I don't think it sounds like a bad show.

1401
01:57:41,080 --> 01:57:43,080
It's just basically a documentary-ish type of show.

1402
01:57:43,080 --> 01:57:48,080
I mean, it's not like they're voting people out or bombing people when they lose.

1403
01:57:48,080 --> 01:57:50,080
You get voted out of Afghanistan!

1404
01:57:50,080 --> 01:57:51,080
Kaboom!

1405
01:57:51,080 --> 01:57:52,080
Sweet!

1406
01:57:52,080 --> 01:57:54,080
Yeah, so I don't know.

1407
01:57:54,080 --> 01:57:56,080
I'm sorry, we're sending you home.

1408
01:57:56,080 --> 01:57:57,080
You know why this is news?

1409
01:57:57,080 --> 01:58:00,080
It's an interesting show on G4.

1410
01:58:00,080 --> 01:58:02,080
But I really don't understand The Hurt Locker connection.

1411
01:58:02,080 --> 01:58:05,080
I think it's just they're doing it because of the movie.

1412
01:58:05,080 --> 01:58:06,080
I think I would watch it.

1413
01:58:06,080 --> 01:58:12,080
It made that subject, it put that subject in the public eye, if you will.

1414
01:58:12,080 --> 01:58:14,080
And this is just furthering that, so I don't know.

1415
01:58:14,080 --> 01:58:16,080
I don't necessarily see it as bad news.

1416
01:58:16,080 --> 01:58:21,080
It's just not gaming, but how long has G4 not been gaming for?

1417
01:58:21,080 --> 01:58:24,080
I'll tell you, a really long time.

1418
01:58:24,080 --> 01:58:28,080
By the way, also, in somewhat related-ish news,

1419
01:58:28,080 --> 01:58:34,080
EA is standing by their, again, this is from a tweet from DJ Blazekin,

1420
01:58:34,080 --> 01:58:39,080
EA is standing by Medal of Honor's choice to include the Taliban.

1421
01:58:39,080 --> 01:58:42,080
You'll see a comment here from British Defense Secretary Liam Fox,

1422
01:58:42,080 --> 01:58:44,080
who criticized the game, quote,

1423
01:58:44,080 --> 01:58:47,080
At the hands of the Taliban, children have lost fathers and wives have lost husbands.

1424
01:58:47,080 --> 01:58:52,080
It's shocking that someone would think it is acceptable to recreate the acts of the Taliban and British soldiers.

1425
01:58:52,080 --> 01:58:58,080
It's hard to believe any citizen of our country would wish to buy such a thoroughly un-British game.

1426
01:58:58,080 --> 01:59:03,080
I would urge retailers to show their support for our armed forces and ban this tasteless product.

1427
01:59:03,080 --> 01:59:10,080
Ooh, EA standing by it, saying it is a creative risk, but they are not going to let the protesters, quote,

1428
01:59:10,080 --> 01:59:14,080
Compromise our creative vision and what we want to do.

1429
01:59:14,080 --> 01:59:16,080
If you don't like it, don't buy it.

1430
01:59:16,080 --> 01:59:18,080
Sounds good to me.

1431
01:59:18,080 --> 01:59:21,080
Going back to the tweets.

1432
01:59:21,080 --> 01:59:22,080
Let's see.

1433
01:59:22,080 --> 01:59:25,080
Darkiske says, talk about Reach.

1434
01:59:25,080 --> 01:59:28,080
I have to admit, I haven't really been paying attention to a lot of the details about Halo Reach.

1435
01:59:28,080 --> 01:59:30,080
I can't reach you from here, Rob.

1436
01:59:30,080 --> 01:59:33,080
I didn't play Halo 3 ODST at all.

1437
01:59:33,080 --> 01:59:36,080
I'm not a Halo hater, I used to love Halo.

1438
01:59:36,080 --> 01:59:39,080
I played Halo 1, I loved Halo 2.

1439
01:59:39,080 --> 01:59:42,080
I played a shit ton of Halo 2 and I even played a little bit of Halo 3.

1440
01:59:42,080 --> 01:59:46,080
But I don't know, Halo 3 just kind of, it wasn't as...

1441
01:59:46,080 --> 01:59:51,080
Plus the group I used to play with, a bunch of college buddies, a bunch of them had babies and stuff.

1442
01:59:51,080 --> 01:59:54,080
They don't want to play video games online anymore.

1443
01:59:54,080 --> 01:59:56,080
So there you go.

1444
01:59:56,080 --> 01:59:58,080
I kind of lost interest in the Halo series.

1445
01:59:58,080 --> 02:00:00,080
I'll check it out.

1446
02:00:00,080 --> 02:00:02,080
If somebody I know buys it, I'll look.

1447
02:00:02,080 --> 02:00:04,080
Is Dan getting Halo Reach?

1448
02:00:04,080 --> 02:00:06,080
You guys probably aren't getting it, huh?

1449
02:00:06,080 --> 02:00:08,080
That depends.

1450
02:00:08,080 --> 02:00:10,080
Yeah, he'll probably get Halo Reach.

1451
02:00:10,080 --> 02:00:12,080
I'm sure it's a popular game.

1452
02:00:12,080 --> 02:00:14,080
We'll see.

1453
02:00:14,080 --> 02:00:18,080
Tigerclaw305 sends us some links.

1454
02:00:18,080 --> 02:00:22,080
Real quickly, a Wii balance board used to create a motorized baby buggy.

1455
02:00:22,080 --> 02:00:24,080
That's awesome.

1456
02:00:24,080 --> 02:00:26,080
How does that work?

1457
02:00:26,080 --> 02:00:30,080
It's a toddler that can't really, or not even toddler, an infant that can't walk yet.

1458
02:00:30,080 --> 02:00:34,080
So they sit her down in this little infant seat.

1459
02:00:34,080 --> 02:00:38,080
And it's sitting on top of a Wii balance board.

1460
02:00:38,080 --> 02:00:42,080
And below that is a robot.

1461
02:00:42,080 --> 02:00:48,080
And so when she leans to go grab for something, because babies like to grab at what they want,

1462
02:00:48,080 --> 02:00:50,080
it goes in that direction.

1463
02:00:50,080 --> 02:00:52,080
Who makes the Skynet?

1464
02:00:52,080 --> 02:00:54,080
It's a college student.

1465
02:00:54,080 --> 02:00:56,080
Oh, of course.

1466
02:00:56,080 --> 02:00:58,080
But it's awfully cute.

1467
02:00:58,080 --> 02:01:00,080
Also another link from Tigerclaw.

1468
02:01:00,080 --> 02:01:04,080
Lenovo developing a motion control console for China.

1469
02:01:04,080 --> 02:01:08,080
I guess it's called the E-Box, is what this is.

1470
02:01:08,080 --> 02:01:10,080
It's the technology of Kinect.

1471
02:01:10,080 --> 02:01:16,080
Unlike the move in the Wii, E-Box plots movements and translates them into an on-screen action

1472
02:01:16,080 --> 02:01:18,080
without the need for controller.

1473
02:01:18,080 --> 02:01:22,080
No price announced yet, but it will be between the price of a Wii and a 360.

1474
02:01:22,080 --> 02:01:25,080
The console, I think this is an interesting topic here too.

1475
02:01:25,080 --> 02:01:30,080
The console will also focus less on violence and more on family entertainment.

1476
02:01:30,080 --> 02:01:32,080
Well, as does the Kinect.

1477
02:01:32,080 --> 02:01:34,080
Oops.

1478
02:01:34,080 --> 02:01:37,080
I swear I didn't plan that song to come on, but it's kind of funny in retrospect.

1479
02:01:37,080 --> 02:01:39,080
Alright, anyhow.

1480
02:01:39,080 --> 02:01:42,080
More tweets.

1481
02:01:42,080 --> 02:01:44,080
Maybe this will be the last one here.

1482
02:01:44,080 --> 02:01:46,080
Oh no, there's a couple here.

1483
02:01:46,080 --> 02:01:48,080
DarkKiske gets another one in here.

1484
02:01:48,080 --> 02:01:52,080
Maxis Darkspore, a Diablo-style action RPG.

1485
02:01:52,080 --> 02:01:54,080
I don't know much about Darkspore.

1486
02:01:54,080 --> 02:01:56,080
Is this a game you know a little more about?

1487
02:01:56,080 --> 02:02:00,080
It's basically a spore, but set in a Diablo-type gameplay.

1488
02:02:00,080 --> 02:02:03,080
So you create your character and it's a hack and slash game.

1489
02:02:03,080 --> 02:02:05,080
Oh, that sounds kind of cool.

1490
02:02:05,080 --> 02:02:07,080
Maxis is the folks that made Spore after all.

1491
02:02:07,080 --> 02:02:09,080
They also made The Sims.

1492
02:02:09,080 --> 02:02:11,080
They've been around a while, because that's basically Will Wright's studio, isn't it?

1493
02:02:11,080 --> 02:02:13,080
This could be interesting.

1494
02:02:13,080 --> 02:02:15,080
They're saying it's a co-op focused action game.

1495
02:02:15,080 --> 02:02:19,080
Ooh, that's cool, because that sounds kind of like the Lara Croft game that I played this week that I like.

1496
02:02:19,080 --> 02:02:21,080
So I'll check this out.

1497
02:02:21,080 --> 02:02:24,080
There's some images posted up on this website that we got linked to.

1498
02:02:24,080 --> 02:02:26,080
Looks interesting. I'll keep an eye on that.

1499
02:02:26,080 --> 02:02:29,080
Of course, it depends on how much it costs.

1500
02:02:29,080 --> 02:02:32,080
In this day and age, you've got to watch what you're buying.

1501
02:02:32,080 --> 02:02:34,080
ActDeft is linking us to a story.

1502
02:02:34,080 --> 02:02:38,080
X-Play gave Metroid Other M a 2 out of 5.

1503
02:02:38,080 --> 02:02:40,080
Says no need to watch the video.

1504
02:02:40,080 --> 02:02:47,080
That's some intern at the station trying to keep X-Play relevant by causing a little controversy, I'm sure.

1505
02:02:47,080 --> 02:02:50,080
No, I don't know. Maybe the game is terrible. I don't know.

1506
02:02:50,080 --> 02:02:53,080
It didn't get terrible reviews. I think it looks pretty good.

1507
02:02:53,080 --> 02:02:59,080
I think what people didn't like was how sometimes it would switch between the first person and third person view.

1508
02:02:59,080 --> 02:03:05,080
Just if you happened to move the controller off the screen, it would just all of a sudden switch back, and that kind of sucked.

1509
02:03:05,080 --> 02:03:11,080
And also the fact that you couldn't basically run around in the first person mode, so people had gripes about that.

1510
02:03:11,080 --> 02:03:17,080
Probably because they've been playing Metroid Prime for a while, but whatever. It looks kind of cool.

1511
02:03:17,080 --> 02:03:20,080
I'll just go on record and say fuck X-Play.

1512
02:03:20,080 --> 02:03:22,080
Lastly, Sturlok.

1513
02:03:22,080 --> 02:03:28,080
Pokemon Black and White are the fastest selling DS games in history. Well, there's a big surprise.

1514
02:03:28,080 --> 02:03:30,080
Links us to this article.

1515
02:03:30,080 --> 02:03:39,080
That does confirm, ever since July 31st, 2010, over a million pre-orders for Pokemon Black and White version were taken.

1516
02:03:39,080 --> 02:03:45,080
That's 1.08 pre-orders for this game launching September 18th, 2010.

1517
02:03:45,080 --> 02:03:51,080
And so Nintendo is saying that is going to make Pokemon Black and White the fastest selling DS games ever.

1518
02:03:51,080 --> 02:03:54,080
See, that's cheating, though, because there's two different games there.

1519
02:03:54,080 --> 02:03:58,080
But they counted as one. That's fuzzy math.

1520
02:03:58,080 --> 02:04:02,080
Whatever. I guess everybody lets them get away with it, because it's Pokemans.

1521
02:04:02,080 --> 02:04:08,080
Tigerclaw wants to point out that Metroid Other M has an 81 on Metacritic.

1522
02:04:08,080 --> 02:04:13,080
So that two out of five seems to be a little bit out of place.

1523
02:04:13,080 --> 02:04:16,080
Anyhow, let's move on to some other gaming news.

1524
02:04:16,080 --> 02:04:20,080
If you want to send us some tweets for next week, twitter.com slash O-L-R.

1525
02:04:20,080 --> 02:04:24,080
Yeah, I'm sure they have their own justifications for that, but whatever.

1526
02:04:24,080 --> 02:04:29,080
So, since we mentioned Reach a little bit, Reach, of course, did get pirated.

1527
02:04:29,080 --> 02:04:39,080
There was apparently people that found a way to download the supposed review only version of Reach that was a games on demand package.

1528
02:04:39,080 --> 02:04:46,080
And, of course, as not a big surprise, Microsoft saying, oh, we're going to ban everybody that's playing Reach.

1529
02:04:46,080 --> 02:04:51,080
Well, first off, if you're dumb enough to play online with Reach, then yes, you should be banned anyways.

1530
02:04:51,080 --> 02:04:57,080
I'm assuming that this is also considering people that aren't necessarily playing online,

1531
02:04:57,080 --> 02:05:02,080
but say people that have a JTAG console or something and have an account that they use for live,

1532
02:05:02,080 --> 02:05:06,080
and maybe move their account back and forth on a memory unit or something like that,

1533
02:05:06,080 --> 02:05:10,080
and it would show in your recently played games or something like that,

1534
02:05:10,080 --> 02:05:13,080
or if you get achievements before the release date.

1535
02:05:13,080 --> 02:05:18,080
And then they can check out whether you have a mod console or something like that.

1536
02:05:18,080 --> 02:05:28,080
So, you know, if you don't want to get banned, just don't play with a profile that you use online until it's launched.

1537
02:05:28,080 --> 02:05:33,080
And they claim, though, that they can tell the difference between this and with the full version,

1538
02:05:33,080 --> 02:05:40,080
but, you know, if you're really that scared about it, you can always re-download it when it gets leaked out from the disc.

1539
02:05:40,080 --> 02:05:45,080
I don't know. But, yeah, so they're threatening to ban people, as they probably would.

1540
02:05:45,080 --> 02:05:49,080
This doesn't come as a big surprise, though. I mean, they always want to ban people who are playing the game.

1541
02:05:49,080 --> 02:05:50,080
Of course. They don't want to say,

1542
02:05:50,080 --> 02:05:55,080
Well, oh, darn, I guess there's nothing we can do about it. Steal away.

1543
02:05:55,080 --> 02:05:57,080
I mean, they're not going to say that.

1544
02:05:57,080 --> 02:06:00,080
They're going to be like, we're going to come to your house and set you on fire.

1545
02:06:00,080 --> 02:06:03,080
I mean, that's the kind of threats that they should be making.

1546
02:06:03,080 --> 02:06:05,080
We will destroy you.

1547
02:06:05,080 --> 02:06:08,080
If we could make your Xbox do other ring colors, we would.

1548
02:06:08,080 --> 02:06:11,080
Your console will get set on fire and burn down your house and kill your cat.

1549
02:06:11,080 --> 02:06:14,080
That's right.

1550
02:06:14,080 --> 02:06:17,080
I don't know. Shermy's very well insulated.

1551
02:06:17,080 --> 02:06:22,080
That would be funny, though. They have a robot, like, robot legs built into it.

1552
02:06:22,080 --> 02:06:25,080
It just gets up, walks out, and goes back to Microsoft.

1553
02:06:25,080 --> 02:06:31,080
Now, that's a show I want to see on G4. Cat versus Xbox.

1554
02:06:31,080 --> 02:06:32,080
We've had that at my house.

1555
02:06:32,080 --> 02:06:33,080
Have you?

1556
02:06:33,080 --> 02:06:34,080
You know what it was?

1557
02:06:34,080 --> 02:06:35,080
What?

1558
02:06:35,080 --> 02:06:38,080
Jamie taking the vacuum to the Xbox to get the cat hair out of it.

1559
02:06:38,080 --> 02:06:39,080
Mm-hmm. Nice.

1560
02:06:39,080 --> 02:06:40,080
Cat wins.

1561
02:06:40,080 --> 02:06:43,080
Maybe the cat was laying on top of it because it's warm. You know that happens quite a bit.

1562
02:06:43,080 --> 02:06:48,080
Shermy... It would be too much effort for Shermy to get on top of it. I'll put it that way.

1563
02:06:48,080 --> 02:06:52,080
My cat loves my Xbox 360, especially in the winter. She'll lay behind it.

1564
02:06:52,080 --> 02:06:57,080
But she'll lay so close to it that there's no airflow, so I don't really appreciate that too much.

1565
02:06:57,080 --> 02:07:02,080
But she will lay next to it. That and the computer. She loves, you know, all the hot air being blown out.

1566
02:07:02,080 --> 02:07:03,080
They're warm.

1567
02:07:03,080 --> 02:07:06,080
Exactly. Or she'll lay on power supplies, you know, like those big old transformers.

1568
02:07:06,080 --> 02:07:07,080
Mm-hmm.

1569
02:07:07,080 --> 02:07:08,080
Because they're super hot.

1570
02:07:08,080 --> 02:07:09,080
Yeah.

1571
02:07:09,080 --> 02:07:12,080
She's just, like, laying her head right on them. Like, kitty, you're going to electrocute yourself for something.

1572
02:07:12,080 --> 02:07:15,080
You know what your cat needs is, like, an electric blanket or some other source of...

1573
02:07:15,080 --> 02:07:16,080
No, she doesn't.

1574
02:07:16,080 --> 02:07:22,080
You know what I got for Shermy is this mat that redistributes their own heat and warms the whole thing.

1575
02:07:22,080 --> 02:07:24,080
And she loves it, and it was, like, ten bucks.

1576
02:07:24,080 --> 02:07:28,080
She has her little baby bed that she lays in still, even though she's, like, way bigger than it.

1577
02:07:28,080 --> 02:07:29,080
But, you know...

1578
02:07:29,080 --> 02:07:30,080
You know what your cat needs?

1579
02:07:30,080 --> 02:07:32,080
She's spoiled, and she doesn't need anything.

1580
02:07:32,080 --> 02:07:33,080
Kitten mittens.

1581
02:07:34,080 --> 02:07:37,080
Does your cat make too much noise?

1582
02:07:37,080 --> 02:07:42,080
Mittens made out of kittens? Well, we got plenty of kittens to do that, so...

1583
02:07:42,080 --> 02:07:46,080
All right, speaking of which, does anyone want a kitten? I mean, because I've got, like, tons of them.

1584
02:07:46,080 --> 02:07:47,080
They're overrunning my backyard.

1585
02:07:47,080 --> 02:07:50,080
What are you going to do if somebody in New York is like, yes, I want a cat?

1586
02:07:50,080 --> 02:07:53,080
I will put it in a box and ship it UPS. No, no, just kidding.

1587
02:07:53,080 --> 02:07:55,080
I will not do that because that's cruel.

1588
02:07:55,080 --> 02:07:57,080
Then we'll ship it FedEx. No.

1589
02:07:57,080 --> 02:08:02,080
Obviously, I can't get you a cat unless you actually drive all the way out here.

1590
02:08:02,080 --> 02:08:06,080
Heart eight in our chat room suggests a cat Snuggie. I like that idea.

1591
02:08:06,080 --> 02:08:09,080
But, unfortunately, you will have to come and... It's kind of like pick and pull.

1592
02:08:09,080 --> 02:08:14,080
You will have to pick and pull your own cat out of the backyard, so...

1593
02:08:14,080 --> 02:08:16,080
I can't provide that service for you.

1594
02:08:16,080 --> 02:08:18,080
There's only one cat that will actually...

1595
02:08:18,080 --> 02:08:22,080
There's one of the cats that will actually get, like, very, you know, paralyzed with fear.

1596
02:08:22,080 --> 02:08:25,080
And that's the only cat that I can actually pick up out there.

1597
02:08:25,080 --> 02:08:28,080
Because it'll just kind of freeze up, and I just...

1598
02:08:28,080 --> 02:08:29,080
Scoop. Scoop it right up.

1599
02:08:29,080 --> 02:08:32,080
Can I completely derail the show with a YouTube?

1600
02:08:32,080 --> 02:08:33,080
Which makes for awesome radio.

1601
02:08:33,080 --> 02:08:36,080
But, okay, here's the thing. Like, I...

1602
02:08:36,080 --> 02:08:39,080
I'm not a big dog person, right? I'm not a big fan of dogs.

1603
02:08:39,080 --> 02:08:41,080
I think they're kind of, like...

1604
02:08:41,080 --> 02:08:45,080
I was bit by one when I was five, and I've had, like, these weird symptoms ever since.

1605
02:08:45,080 --> 02:08:51,080
But, Alan showed me a video this week that makes me want a dog.

1606
02:08:51,080 --> 02:08:55,080
Like, seriously. Because this is the cutest dog I've ever seen in my life.

1607
02:08:55,080 --> 02:08:57,080
Okay? And you know what type of dog it is?

1608
02:08:57,080 --> 02:08:58,080
It's a Corgi.

1609
02:08:58,080 --> 02:09:00,080
I love Corgis!

1610
02:09:00,080 --> 02:09:04,080
And the video, if you want to look this up on YouTube, is called Corgi Flop.

1611
02:09:04,080 --> 02:09:07,080
And it's the most adorable thing I've ever seen in my entire life.

1612
02:09:07,080 --> 02:09:09,080
So, like, there's this little dog that goes in, and then they got...

1613
02:09:09,080 --> 02:09:11,080
Oh, wait, wait, oh, where's the Corgi?

1614
02:09:11,080 --> 02:09:12,080
Corgi!

1615
02:09:12,080 --> 02:09:15,080
Okay, so the dog and the person jump in, there goes the Corgi.

1616
02:09:15,080 --> 02:09:16,080
Corgi's like...

1617
02:09:16,080 --> 02:09:19,080
The Corgi, like, watches for a minute, and then the Corgi just...

1618
02:09:19,080 --> 02:09:21,080
At one point, the Corgi goes...

1619
02:09:21,080 --> 02:09:23,080
Come on, come on, do it, do it, do it, do it. Flop!

1620
02:09:25,080 --> 02:09:26,080
Those little legs.

1621
02:09:26,080 --> 02:09:28,080
They're so adorable!

1622
02:09:28,080 --> 02:09:31,080
Oh, and Rob, for the record, Corgis are very friendly dogs.

1623
02:09:31,080 --> 02:09:34,080
I know, I know, and a Corgi would never bite me.

1624
02:09:34,080 --> 02:09:36,080
That's something that, like, pit bulls do.

1625
02:09:36,080 --> 02:09:39,080
Corgis are just adorable, and they swim and everything.

1626
02:09:39,080 --> 02:09:40,080
You definitely should get...

1627
02:09:40,080 --> 02:09:42,080
Oops! Flop!

1628
02:09:42,080 --> 02:09:47,080
She'd definitely get a Pembroke Welsh Corgi, Rob.

1629
02:09:47,080 --> 02:09:50,080
Although that laughing sounds evil.

1630
02:09:50,080 --> 02:09:52,080
Let me link that in our chatroom there, so...

1631
02:09:52,080 --> 02:09:54,080
Because I apologize, that makes for terrible radio,

1632
02:09:54,080 --> 02:09:57,080
but I had to derail the show and just tell you about my experience where...

1633
02:09:57,080 --> 02:10:00,080
That's a big deal. For me to say I want a dog is, like, a huge deal.

1634
02:10:00,080 --> 02:10:02,080
Like, ask somebody who's known me for years and years.

1635
02:10:02,080 --> 02:10:04,080
Dark Sakura? Me saying I want a dog?

1636
02:10:04,080 --> 02:10:05,080
That's like...

1637
02:10:05,080 --> 02:10:08,080
Like, call hell and ask if they've got ice cream, because seriously...

1638
02:10:08,080 --> 02:10:09,080
Really, yeah.

1639
02:10:09,080 --> 02:10:10,080
Alright, anyhow...

1640
02:10:10,080 --> 02:10:15,080
It's like going into Rob's bedroom and finding an AK under his bed.

1641
02:10:15,080 --> 02:10:17,080
Pretty much.

1642
02:10:17,080 --> 02:10:19,080
Alright, anyhow, let's move on.

1643
02:10:19,080 --> 02:10:23,080
This is shocking news as well, actually.

1644
02:10:23,080 --> 02:10:26,080
I don't know, this is really dividing the community,

1645
02:10:26,080 --> 02:10:30,080
and this is news about Final Fantasy XIV

1646
02:10:30,080 --> 02:10:34,080
and what the game director Nobuaki Komodo said this week

1647
02:10:34,080 --> 02:10:38,080
about the 8 hour a week limit.

1648
02:10:38,080 --> 02:10:40,080
Yes, that's right.

1649
02:10:40,080 --> 02:10:43,080
What's happening is that apparently in Final Fantasy XIV,

1650
02:10:43,080 --> 02:10:47,080
once you've played a particular job class for 8 hours,

1651
02:10:47,080 --> 02:10:50,080
the amount of experience you start to earn decreases.

1652
02:10:50,080 --> 02:10:54,080
And once you've played for 15 hours, you're done.

1653
02:10:54,080 --> 02:10:57,080
You can't earn any more experience.

1654
02:10:57,080 --> 02:11:00,080
This is the reverse of what other games like World of Warcraft do, where...

1655
02:11:00,080 --> 02:11:03,080
Wait, is it just one job class? Can you switch classes to something else?

1656
02:11:03,080 --> 02:11:05,080
Yes, apparently you can.

1657
02:11:05,080 --> 02:11:07,080
But that's like, you know, if you remember Final Fantasy XI,

1658
02:11:07,080 --> 02:11:09,080
that's practically like doing a whole different character.

1659
02:11:09,080 --> 02:11:10,080
Completely different.

1660
02:11:10,080 --> 02:11:13,080
Here's a quote real quick about why this system is in place.

1661
02:11:13,080 --> 02:11:16,080
Quote, first off, the main concept behind Final Fantasy XIV

1662
02:11:16,080 --> 02:11:19,080
is allowing those players with little time on their hands to play effectively,

1663
02:11:19,080 --> 02:11:21,080
and game balance is based off of that.

1664
02:11:21,080 --> 02:11:25,080
Furthermore, it is being designed to not give those with more time on their hands

1665
02:11:25,080 --> 02:11:28,080
to play an unfair advantage.

1666
02:11:28,080 --> 02:11:33,080
And also we don't want people that play in, you know, say, you know,

1667
02:11:33,080 --> 02:11:38,080
was it those internet cafes in Hong Kong, you know, abandoning their children

1668
02:11:38,080 --> 02:11:41,080
and killing themselves over playing this game.

1669
02:11:41,080 --> 02:11:45,080
Because of that, systems such as Guardian's Favor, a bonus to guild levs,

1670
02:11:45,080 --> 02:11:48,080
have been implemented to make leveling in the short term easier

1671
02:11:48,080 --> 02:11:50,080
than leveling in the long term.

1672
02:11:50,080 --> 02:11:56,080
And of course there are tons of people just up in arms about this.

1673
02:11:56,080 --> 02:11:58,080
Like on the website going crazy.

1674
02:11:58,080 --> 02:12:00,080
Like you guys have got to be kidding me.

1675
02:12:00,080 --> 02:12:03,080
Who are you to tell me how long I can be playing these games?

1676
02:12:03,080 --> 02:12:05,080
Da da da da da. It's my money.

1677
02:12:05,080 --> 02:12:09,080
There's another thing though to consider is that if it's also on a per character basis,

1678
02:12:09,080 --> 02:12:14,080
it also sort of balances out the leveling.

1679
02:12:14,080 --> 02:12:20,080
I mean the, what's the word I'm thinking of, the hierarchy of levels

1680
02:12:20,080 --> 02:12:25,080
to where you're not going to have, you know, a week later maxed out characters.

1681
02:12:25,080 --> 02:12:30,080
You're going to have people that to really follow the incentive

1682
02:12:30,080 --> 02:12:34,080
that are going to be on a more even par so people move up together

1683
02:12:34,080 --> 02:12:38,080
and then they can start putting out content, you know, later on

1684
02:12:38,080 --> 02:12:42,080
for those people who hit those higher levels. Does that make sense?

1685
02:12:42,080 --> 02:12:46,080
A little bit. Now there was a translation that came out on the North America website

1686
02:12:46,080 --> 02:12:48,080
that helped to try to bring some clarity to this.

1687
02:12:48,080 --> 02:12:52,080
It's very lengthy. Let me try to give you the bullet points here.

1688
02:12:52,080 --> 02:12:55,080
We calculated a value for the amount of skill or experience points

1689
02:12:55,080 --> 02:12:57,080
that could be earned in a one hour period.

1690
02:12:57,080 --> 02:13:01,080
This theoretical value represents an hour spent engaged solely in combat,

1691
02:13:01,080 --> 02:13:05,080
left quests or any other activities that earn skill or experience points

1692
02:13:05,080 --> 02:13:09,080
and sets a threshold to delimiting how many of these points can be earned in a period of play.

1693
02:13:09,080 --> 02:13:13,080
Based on this, we have implemented a threshold value concept.

1694
02:13:13,080 --> 02:13:16,080
These thresholds are regulated by a one week timer

1695
02:13:16,080 --> 02:13:19,080
that begins counting down the instant you earn experience points.

1696
02:13:19,080 --> 02:13:21,080
After a week is passed, the thresholds will reset

1697
02:13:21,080 --> 02:13:23,080
and the moment skill experience points are earned again,

1698
02:13:23,080 --> 02:13:25,080
the timer begins counting down anew.

1699
02:13:25,080 --> 02:13:28,080
For the first eight thresholds during this week long period,

1700
02:13:28,080 --> 02:13:31,080
players will receive skill or experience points at the maximum rate

1701
02:13:31,080 --> 02:13:36,080
and then it goes on after that and then eventually reaches a rate of zero.

1702
02:13:36,080 --> 02:13:40,080
It is worth noting, however, that the reduced rate will also gradually recover

1703
02:13:40,080 --> 02:13:44,080
while players are engaged in activities that do not yield skill or experience points.

1704
02:13:44,080 --> 02:13:48,080
In this manner, it is possible for the threshold value to reset completely

1705
02:13:48,080 --> 02:13:51,080
even before the completion of the one week timer.

1706
02:13:51,080 --> 02:13:54,080
So in a nutshell, this is very convoluted,

1707
02:13:54,080 --> 02:13:57,080
but those of you that just plan to take three days off work

1708
02:13:57,080 --> 02:14:00,080
and play Final Fantasy XIV nonstop when this comes out

1709
02:14:00,080 --> 02:14:03,080
are going to be hitting this wall.

1710
02:14:03,080 --> 02:14:07,080
Yeah, but now they're talking about stuff that doesn't require skills.

1711
02:14:07,080 --> 02:14:10,080
So say, for example, I go and fight, fight, fight, fight,

1712
02:14:10,080 --> 02:14:12,080
and then burn out the whole thing.

1713
02:14:12,080 --> 02:14:15,080
Then I can go craft and that will kind of build it back.

1714
02:14:15,080 --> 02:14:18,080
I mean, I could spend a bunch of time like making food or something.

1715
02:14:18,080 --> 02:14:21,080
I don't know.

1716
02:14:21,080 --> 02:14:23,080
It's interesting. I mean, it's their game.

1717
02:14:23,080 --> 02:14:25,080
They can do what they want, but let me go back.

1718
02:14:25,080 --> 02:14:28,080
I've played the Final Fantasy XIV beta. It stinks.

1719
02:14:28,080 --> 02:14:32,080
And I'm sorry. I don't think they made a quick game at all.

1720
02:14:32,080 --> 02:14:36,080
It's harder, at least in the beta I played.

1721
02:14:36,080 --> 02:14:39,080
Again, it's been a couple months, or maybe a month.

1722
02:14:39,080 --> 02:14:42,080
But in the beta I played, it was much harder to go out and kill monsters

1723
02:14:42,080 --> 02:14:46,080
than just log in, warp, and click and go.

1724
02:14:46,080 --> 02:14:49,080
It honestly feels, and I'm really trying not to be biased,

1725
02:14:49,080 --> 02:14:52,080
but it feels like it was a lot faster in WoW,

1726
02:14:52,080 --> 02:14:55,080
or even Ion if you want to take a non-WoW game, or Guild Wars.

1727
02:14:55,080 --> 02:14:58,080
All those games seemed a lot easier to get going in

1728
02:14:58,080 --> 02:15:00,080
than it did Final Fantasy XIV.

1729
02:15:00,080 --> 02:15:02,080
For me, that's where the weirdness is of this,

1730
02:15:02,080 --> 02:15:06,080
is that they swear up and down they want to make this more casual MMO

1731
02:15:06,080 --> 02:15:08,080
and something you don't have to spend all this time playing,

1732
02:15:08,080 --> 02:15:12,080
but it just seems like the game itself is still Final Fantasy XI upgraded.

1733
02:15:12,080 --> 02:15:14,080
You know what I mean?

1734
02:15:14,080 --> 02:15:16,080
So, I don't know.

1735
02:15:16,080 --> 02:15:17,080
That'd be weird.

1736
02:15:17,080 --> 02:15:18,080
Bonds in our chat room says,

1737
02:15:18,080 --> 02:15:20,080
Good thing Warcraft does not do that.

1738
02:15:20,080 --> 02:15:23,080
Well, if you think about it, though, they do in a way.

1739
02:15:23,080 --> 02:15:25,080
They just do the reverse.

1740
02:15:25,080 --> 02:15:29,080
You get rewarded with double XP for the time you aren't playing

1741
02:15:29,080 --> 02:15:31,080
and you're logged out consecutively on a character,

1742
02:15:31,080 --> 02:15:34,080
and that's to help you catch up so that people can't get too far ahead.

1743
02:15:34,080 --> 02:15:37,080
So, it's just like it's more of a reward than a penalty,

1744
02:15:37,080 --> 02:15:41,080
and I think that seems to be where a lot of people are up in arms.

1745
02:15:41,080 --> 02:15:43,080
Ziba in our chat room says,

1746
02:15:43,080 --> 02:15:44,080
Guild Wars 2 all the way.

1747
02:15:44,080 --> 02:15:47,080
You know, I saw a video of Guild Wars 2 gameplay,

1748
02:15:47,080 --> 02:15:49,080
and I got to say, it looks pretty hot.

1749
02:15:49,080 --> 02:15:51,080
It looks very action-oriented.

1750
02:15:51,080 --> 02:15:56,080
Let me see if I can find that same video here, another quick YouTube.

1751
02:15:56,080 --> 02:16:00,080
Have either of you guys heard anything about Guild Wars 2 or seen any of this?

1752
02:16:00,080 --> 02:16:01,080
Nope.

1753
02:16:01,080 --> 02:16:02,080
A video came out of...

1754
02:16:02,080 --> 02:16:04,080
Yeah, I kind of got out of the Guild Wars thing, so...

1755
02:16:04,080 --> 02:16:06,080
Yeah, but this is so different.

1756
02:16:06,080 --> 02:16:08,080
Oh, here it is.

1757
02:16:08,080 --> 02:16:10,080
I think this is out of Gamescom.

1758
02:16:10,080 --> 02:16:13,080
Yeah, there we go.

1759
02:16:13,080 --> 02:16:15,080
Like, it's more of an...

1760
02:16:15,080 --> 02:16:17,080
This probably isn't the best video to show it off,

1761
02:16:17,080 --> 02:16:19,080
but it looks a lot more like action-based.

1762
02:16:19,080 --> 02:16:21,080
Very pretty.

1763
02:16:21,080 --> 02:16:24,080
This is some leaked video out of Gamescom we're watching here in studio

1764
02:16:24,080 --> 02:16:26,080
to see, like, the hit point numbers flying,

1765
02:16:26,080 --> 02:16:27,080
and this guy's dual-wielding.

1766
02:16:27,080 --> 02:16:29,080
It looks really cool.

1767
02:16:29,080 --> 02:16:30,080
I got to say.

1768
02:16:30,080 --> 02:16:33,080
I'll post that link in chat so you guys can look at the video that I'm looking at.

1769
02:16:33,080 --> 02:16:35,080
I think that's going to be a pretty neat game.

1770
02:16:35,080 --> 02:16:37,080
All right, anyway, moving on.

1771
02:16:37,080 --> 02:16:39,080
Dark Soccer, what else do you have for us in gaming news?

1772
02:16:39,080 --> 02:16:43,080
Well, in other stuff, we do have...

1773
02:16:43,080 --> 02:16:46,080
Now, this is not just gaming-related.

1774
02:16:46,080 --> 02:16:50,080
This is archaeology and anthropology,

1775
02:16:50,080 --> 02:16:55,080
and prehistoric biology.

1776
02:16:55,080 --> 02:16:57,080
So, like, Indiana Jones?

1777
02:16:57,080 --> 02:16:58,080
Hmm.

1778
02:16:58,080 --> 02:17:00,080
Lara Croft Tomb Raider?

1779
02:17:00,080 --> 02:17:04,080
Basically, on a Pacific island,

1780
02:17:04,080 --> 02:17:10,080
they found a giant turtle that they thought went extinct 50,000 years ago,

1781
02:17:10,080 --> 02:17:13,080
but apparently it still lived on.

1782
02:17:13,080 --> 02:17:17,080
So, in a 3,000-year-old site on the Nautu,

1783
02:17:17,080 --> 02:17:19,080
I guess it's how it's pronounced,

1784
02:17:19,080 --> 02:17:26,080
they found a type of turtle, a maolinid, I believe is how it's said,

1785
02:17:26,080 --> 02:17:29,080
that evolved 50 million years ago.

1786
02:17:29,080 --> 02:17:35,080
But now the funny thing about it is that when you look at it face-on,

1787
02:17:35,080 --> 02:17:38,080
it looks like King Koopa.

1788
02:17:38,080 --> 02:17:39,080
Seriously.

1789
02:17:39,080 --> 02:17:44,080
It's got the same facial shape,

1790
02:17:44,080 --> 02:17:45,080
the same...

1791
02:17:45,080 --> 02:17:47,080
And I'm not saying the old-school Koopa.

1792
02:17:47,080 --> 02:17:50,080
I'm saying the modern incarnation.

1793
02:17:50,080 --> 02:17:53,080
It's got that flat head and the horns.

1794
02:17:53,080 --> 02:17:54,080
What are you talking about?

1795
02:17:54,080 --> 02:17:56,080
That thing looks nothing like Dennis Hopper.

1796
02:17:56,080 --> 02:17:57,080
Get it?

1797
02:17:57,080 --> 02:17:59,080
Yes, I get it.

1798
02:17:59,080 --> 02:18:03,080
I know it's too soon, but they're both dead!

1799
02:18:03,080 --> 02:18:05,080
Wah-wah.

1800
02:18:05,080 --> 02:18:07,080
I'm going to actually link the story into the chat room,

1801
02:18:07,080 --> 02:18:09,080
because this is actually pretty cool.

1802
02:18:09,080 --> 02:18:11,080
I'd like to see what our chat room thinks about this.

1803
02:18:11,080 --> 02:18:12,080
A quick wire-in.

1804
02:18:12,080 --> 02:18:13,080
You know what it looks like?

1805
02:18:13,080 --> 02:18:14,080
It looks like...

1806
02:18:14,080 --> 02:18:16,080
Oh, God, what the hell's his name?

1807
02:18:16,080 --> 02:18:17,080
It looks fat, is what it looks like.

1808
02:18:17,080 --> 02:18:21,080
The big old turtle from Final Fantasy.

1809
02:18:21,080 --> 02:18:23,080
Oh, I know what you're talking about.

1810
02:18:23,080 --> 02:18:24,080
Yes, yes.

1811
02:18:24,080 --> 02:18:25,080
I know exactly what you're talking about,

1812
02:18:25,080 --> 02:18:26,080
and I forget the name, too.

1813
02:18:26,080 --> 02:18:29,080
Now, here's the question that's burning on my mind,

1814
02:18:29,080 --> 02:18:30,080
DarkSakura.

1815
02:18:30,080 --> 02:18:33,080
Was it a Koopa Troopa or a Para Koopa Troopa?

1816
02:18:33,080 --> 02:18:34,080
It's a King Koopa.

1817
02:18:34,080 --> 02:18:35,080
Oh, I see.

1818
02:18:35,080 --> 02:18:37,080
Seriously, look at that head.

1819
02:18:37,080 --> 02:18:39,080
That's an ugly sumbitch.

1820
02:18:39,080 --> 02:18:41,080
Well, maybe it's...

1821
02:18:41,080 --> 02:18:43,080
And Rama in chat says,

1822
02:18:43,080 --> 02:18:46,080
Zach, it's my ex-girlfriend.

1823
02:18:46,080 --> 02:18:47,080
You dated a turtle?

1824
02:18:47,080 --> 02:18:52,080
God, you're dumb.

1825
02:18:52,080 --> 02:18:54,080
Of course, I like following all the links on here.

1826
02:18:54,080 --> 02:18:56,080
What kind of weird kinky shit are you into?

1827
02:18:56,080 --> 02:18:59,080
Is it possible that Miyamoto just got inspiration

1828
02:18:59,080 --> 02:19:02,080
from, like, books on the Galapagos Islands or something?

1829
02:19:02,080 --> 02:19:03,080
You know, is it...

1830
02:19:03,080 --> 02:19:04,080
It could be.

1831
02:19:04,080 --> 02:19:06,080
I think we're reading way too much into this.

1832
02:19:06,080 --> 02:19:07,080
Yeah, I think you're right.

1833
02:19:07,080 --> 02:19:10,080
I mean, after all, it's the turtle that decided to evolve

1834
02:19:10,080 --> 02:19:12,080
into something that would become a video game.

1835
02:19:12,080 --> 02:19:13,080
That's why.

1836
02:19:13,080 --> 02:19:15,080
You know, we are thinking way too hard on this,

1837
02:19:15,080 --> 02:19:17,080
and, Loki, I demand a story about porn.

1838
02:19:17,080 --> 02:19:18,080
Help me out here.

1839
02:19:18,080 --> 02:19:20,080
A story about porn?

1840
02:19:20,080 --> 02:19:21,080
Well, you know what?

1841
02:19:21,080 --> 02:19:23,080
I think I can kind of help you out,

1842
02:19:23,080 --> 02:19:25,080
because Playboy is teaming up with Bigpoint

1843
02:19:25,080 --> 02:19:29,080
to form a new game label,

1844
02:19:29,080 --> 02:19:31,080
because, you know, they had some really awesome games

1845
02:19:31,080 --> 02:19:34,080
that came out way back in the day, I guess.

1846
02:19:34,080 --> 02:19:35,080
Now, this isn't about porn,

1847
02:19:35,080 --> 02:19:41,080
because you know you only subscribe to Playboy for the articles.

1848
02:19:41,080 --> 02:19:45,080
Anyways, they're teaming up with Bigpoint,

1849
02:19:45,080 --> 02:19:46,080
which is currently working on, I guess,

1850
02:19:46,080 --> 02:19:48,080
the Battlestar Galactica online game,

1851
02:19:48,080 --> 02:19:50,080
not having to do with porn,

1852
02:19:50,080 --> 02:19:53,080
and other free-to-play games on its own web portal.

1853
02:19:53,080 --> 02:19:57,080
It says Playboy will now also distribute through its own domain

1854
02:19:57,080 --> 02:19:59,080
some free-to-play games.

1855
02:19:59,080 --> 02:20:03,080
The first game to get the red cartman treatment is Poisonville.

1856
02:20:03,080 --> 02:20:07,080
I wonder if this is, like, Farmville, but with poison.

1857
02:20:07,080 --> 02:20:09,080
I play that.

1858
02:20:09,080 --> 02:20:11,080
Link is probably not safe for work.

1859
02:20:11,080 --> 02:20:12,080
Let's check it out.

1860
02:20:12,080 --> 02:20:13,080
Wait, they're teaming up with Playboy, though.

1861
02:20:13,080 --> 02:20:17,080
Why don't they make Boobville on Facebook?

1862
02:20:17,080 --> 02:20:19,080
Poisonville, let's see here.

1863
02:20:19,080 --> 02:20:23,080
And it's on the Playboy.com website, and...

1864
02:20:23,080 --> 02:20:24,080
Boobville, is this thing on?

1865
02:20:24,080 --> 02:20:25,080
It looks like Driver.

1866
02:20:25,080 --> 02:20:26,080
Boobs?

1867
02:20:26,080 --> 02:20:27,080
Boobville?

1868
02:20:27,080 --> 02:20:31,080
No, it looks like, almost like Driver.

1869
02:20:31,080 --> 02:20:32,080
I'm surprised.

1870
02:20:32,080 --> 02:20:37,080
There is no boobs to be seen at this point.

1871
02:20:37,080 --> 02:20:38,080
And the video's not playing,

1872
02:20:38,080 --> 02:20:40,080
so I can only assume that there's no boobs.

1873
02:20:40,080 --> 02:20:43,080
And I am very disappointed by that.

1874
02:20:43,080 --> 02:20:45,080
Although I do have to say, though,

1875
02:20:45,080 --> 02:20:47,080
in the background they have Pam Anderson

1876
02:20:47,080 --> 02:20:49,080
from Miss February 1990,

1877
02:20:49,080 --> 02:20:53,080
and she looks quite different now.

1878
02:20:53,080 --> 02:20:56,080
How could they just make a video game out of boobs,

1879
02:20:56,080 --> 02:20:58,080
you think, that would actually be entertaining?

1880
02:20:58,080 --> 02:21:00,080
They need a new Playboy the Mansion game.

1881
02:21:00,080 --> 02:21:01,080
Remember that?

1882
02:21:01,080 --> 02:21:02,080
Yes.

1883
02:21:02,080 --> 02:21:03,080
Oh, wait, here we go.

1884
02:21:03,080 --> 02:21:04,080
Here we go.

1885
02:21:04,080 --> 02:21:05,080
All right.

1886
02:21:05,080 --> 02:21:08,080
Playboy.com, and...

1887
02:21:08,080 --> 02:21:09,080
What is this game?

1888
02:21:09,080 --> 02:21:11,080
Chew the boobs in three, two, one.

1889
02:21:11,080 --> 02:21:13,080
No, it's some dude, and he's a...

1890
02:21:13,080 --> 02:21:15,080
Is that a chick?

1891
02:21:15,080 --> 02:21:16,080
That might be a chick.

1892
02:21:16,080 --> 02:21:18,080
Some chick just escaped from jail.

1893
02:21:18,080 --> 02:21:19,080
Oh, now she's picking up a...

1894
02:21:19,080 --> 02:21:21,080
A topless chick?

1895
02:21:21,080 --> 02:21:23,080
Oh, she's making out with some dude.

1896
02:21:23,080 --> 02:21:25,080
Oh, and she stole his car.

1897
02:21:25,080 --> 02:21:29,080
Now that sounds like a game changing.

1898
02:21:29,080 --> 02:21:33,080
I could do a GTA game starring, like, a badass chick.

1899
02:21:33,080 --> 02:21:34,080
Well, that's what it seems like so far.

1900
02:21:34,080 --> 02:21:37,080
Yeah, I'll play that.

1901
02:21:37,080 --> 02:21:40,080
And, uh, she's going into the ghetto.

1902
02:21:40,080 --> 02:21:42,080
There's all sorts of guys.

1903
02:21:42,080 --> 02:21:45,080
There's a guy that just did a roundhouse kick into a windshield

1904
02:21:45,080 --> 02:21:46,080
and broke the windshield.

1905
02:21:46,080 --> 02:21:49,080
That's really excessive.

1906
02:21:49,080 --> 02:21:53,080
And now she's teaming up with some really weird-looking bikers.

1907
02:21:53,080 --> 02:21:56,080
It's a bunch of, like, really kind of girl-powered chicks

1908
02:21:56,080 --> 02:21:57,080
with assault rifles.

1909
02:21:57,080 --> 02:21:59,080
So if you imagine, like, a Saints Row or...

1910
02:21:59,080 --> 02:22:01,080
Why is Playboy making this girl...

1911
02:22:01,080 --> 02:22:05,080
They throw her APB with, like, you know, lots of chicks and ski masks and stuff.

1912
02:22:05,080 --> 02:22:08,080
Look, look, I don't mean to sound, like, sexist or whatever,

1913
02:22:08,080 --> 02:22:13,080
but why is Playboy the home of women exploitation,

1914
02:22:13,080 --> 02:22:15,080
making this game that's now like,

1915
02:22:15,080 --> 02:22:17,080
Hey, the girl's in charge.

1916
02:22:17,080 --> 02:22:19,080
I'm Angelina Jolie.

1917
02:22:19,080 --> 02:22:21,080
I'm making out and stealing cars and all this stuff.

1918
02:22:21,080 --> 02:22:24,080
Like, I don't get it.

1919
02:22:24,080 --> 02:22:25,080
It looks neat.

1920
02:22:25,080 --> 02:22:27,080
I mean, if it's free-to-play, I might check it out

1921
02:22:27,080 --> 02:22:29,080
because, you know, it's kind of cool-looking.

1922
02:22:29,080 --> 02:22:32,080
But that's the trailer, which I'm sure has nothing to do

1923
02:22:32,080 --> 02:22:34,080
with the actual gameplay of the game.

1924
02:22:34,080 --> 02:22:39,080
And I gotta say, with a game that's, you know, on Playboy.com,

1925
02:22:39,080 --> 02:22:42,080
not a bit of nudity in there at all.

1926
02:22:42,080 --> 02:22:44,080
No nudity whatsoever.

1927
02:22:44,080 --> 02:22:45,080
Except for Pam Anderson in the background.

1928
02:22:45,080 --> 02:22:46,080
Poisonville.com.

1929
02:22:46,080 --> 02:22:47,080
Let's try that website.

1930
02:22:47,080 --> 02:22:49,080
Maybe there's nudity there.

1931
02:22:49,080 --> 02:22:50,080
Let's see.

1932
02:22:50,080 --> 02:22:52,080
We'll get lucky here.

1933
02:22:52,080 --> 02:22:55,080
Poisonville.com.

1934
02:22:55,080 --> 02:22:56,080
Let's see.

1935
02:22:56,080 --> 02:22:59,080
Toa Gak in our chat room says, GTA, girl take all.

1936
02:22:59,080 --> 02:23:00,080
Your shit.

1937
02:23:00,080 --> 02:23:01,080
In parentheses.

1938
02:23:01,080 --> 02:23:02,080
Nah, he's trying.

1939
02:23:02,080 --> 02:23:03,080
He's trying.

1940
02:23:03,080 --> 02:23:04,080
You need a better acronym than that.

1941
02:23:04,080 --> 02:23:05,080
Oh, oh, oh.

1942
02:23:05,080 --> 02:23:06,080
They've got the beta.

1943
02:23:06,080 --> 02:23:07,080
You can try this.

1944
02:23:07,080 --> 02:23:09,080
Free-to-play right now.

1945
02:23:09,080 --> 02:23:10,080
Someone sounds like an infomercial.

1946
02:23:10,080 --> 02:23:11,080
Are you on Playboy's payroll?

1947
02:23:11,080 --> 02:23:15,080
No, I'm on the Poisonville website.

1948
02:23:15,080 --> 02:23:16,080
But I gotta say, though,

1949
02:23:16,080 --> 02:23:20,080
I'm looking at all these different screenshots and stuff.

1950
02:23:20,080 --> 02:23:21,080
The screenshots look pretty good,

1951
02:23:21,080 --> 02:23:24,080
but the game has no nudity.

1952
02:23:24,080 --> 02:23:28,080
Therefore does not need to be on this website.

1953
02:23:28,080 --> 02:23:33,080
Now, if it's Playboy Mansion, the game, you know,

1954
02:23:33,080 --> 02:23:36,080
where it's kind of an adult version of Charlie's Angels

1955
02:23:36,080 --> 02:23:40,080
where heff is Charlie.

1956
02:23:40,080 --> 02:23:43,080
The girls next door of the game would be great.

1957
02:23:43,080 --> 02:23:44,080
Hello, angels.

1958
02:23:44,080 --> 02:23:47,080
I need you to pleasure me today.

1959
02:23:47,080 --> 02:23:49,080
That's how I kind of picture that game.

1960
02:23:49,080 --> 02:23:51,080
I just want a decent game with boobies.

1961
02:23:51,080 --> 02:23:53,080
Is that too much to ask?

1962
02:23:53,080 --> 02:23:55,080
Besides God of War.

1963
02:23:55,080 --> 02:23:56,080
All right.

1964
02:23:56,080 --> 02:24:00,080
Moving on, let's talk about something that definitely

1965
02:24:00,080 --> 02:24:02,080
doesn't have to do anything at all with boobies.

1966
02:24:02,080 --> 02:24:04,080
In fact, this is possibly the worst possible story

1967
02:24:04,080 --> 02:24:06,080
that could follow up on that last story.

1968
02:24:06,080 --> 02:24:09,080
It has to do with a new Nintendo DS game.

1969
02:24:09,080 --> 02:24:12,080
It's called Atari's Greatest Hits Volume 1.

1970
02:24:12,080 --> 02:24:16,080
It's 50 different games available to play on the Nintendo DS,

1971
02:24:16,080 --> 02:24:21,080
things from the Atari 2600 games such as Sword Quest,

1972
02:24:21,080 --> 02:24:27,080
Tempest, Outlaw, Dodge'em, Real Sports Football,

1973
02:24:27,080 --> 02:24:30,080
Starship, and basically all the same shit you see in Game Room, right?

1974
02:24:30,080 --> 02:24:33,080
And then there's some arcade hits including Pong and

1975
02:24:33,080 --> 02:24:36,080
Lunar Lander and Missile Command and all this.

1976
02:24:36,080 --> 02:24:38,080
I guess the one neat thing about this game,

1977
02:24:38,080 --> 02:24:40,080
it is a $30 cartridge, so you're kind of like,

1978
02:24:40,080 --> 02:24:42,080
oh, boy, what do I care?

1979
02:24:42,080 --> 02:24:44,080
The one neat thing about this game is that it does have

1980
02:24:44,080 --> 02:24:46,080
something Game Room doesn't have.

1981
02:24:46,080 --> 02:24:48,080
Single cartridge multiplayer.

1982
02:24:48,080 --> 02:24:50,080
20 titles in the game's collection.

1983
02:24:50,080 --> 02:24:52,080
I'm imagining some of them are single player and

1984
02:24:52,080 --> 02:24:55,080
don't have a reason to be shared like Adventure and Sword Quest.

1985
02:24:55,080 --> 02:24:58,080
But 20 of the games, you'll be able to share the game data

1986
02:24:58,080 --> 02:25:01,080
with another DS to do multiplayer.

1987
02:25:01,080 --> 02:25:03,080
That includes Space Duel and Pong.

1988
02:25:03,080 --> 02:25:07,080
And you'll be able to do the multiplayer DS with just one cartridge.

1989
02:25:07,080 --> 02:25:10,080
So I guess that's kind of cool, but at the same time,

1990
02:25:10,080 --> 02:25:14,080
I don't know, we got our retro fix with Game Room,

1991
02:25:14,080 --> 02:25:16,080
and if they would just add multiplayer,

1992
02:25:16,080 --> 02:25:19,080
maybe it would be better and so on and so forth.

1993
02:25:19,080 --> 02:25:21,080
There you go.

1994
02:25:21,080 --> 02:25:23,080
Hey, how about the mailbag?

1995
02:25:23,080 --> 02:25:27,080
Let's go to our mailbag at mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com.

1996
02:25:27,080 --> 02:25:30,080
Every week Dark Sakura dives into the mailbag head first,

1997
02:25:30,080 --> 02:25:32,080
picks out a couple emails that she thinks are worthy

1998
02:25:32,080 --> 02:25:35,080
of being read on the show, and then she reads them.

1999
02:25:35,080 --> 02:25:36,080
I do.

2000
02:25:36,080 --> 02:25:37,080
You do.

2001
02:25:37,080 --> 02:25:39,080
So Dark Sakura.

2002
02:25:39,080 --> 02:25:43,080
Well, first of all, I delete any email that's full of stupidity.

2003
02:25:43,080 --> 02:25:44,080
Just thought I'd say that.

2004
02:25:44,080 --> 02:25:46,080
Good for you.

2005
02:25:46,080 --> 02:25:50,080
So let me go on to the first of our beautiful,

2006
02:25:50,080 --> 02:25:53,080
gorgeous, fantastical emails.

2007
02:25:53,080 --> 02:25:55,080
I'll start with a shorty.

2008
02:25:55,080 --> 02:25:56,080
Greetings, OLR crew.

2009
02:25:56,080 --> 02:25:58,080
It's been a while, hasn't it?

2010
02:25:58,080 --> 02:25:59,080
I just want to say that I love the show.

2011
02:25:59,080 --> 02:26:01,080
Also, I saw Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,

2012
02:26:01,080 --> 02:26:03,080
and it's now my new favorite movie.

2013
02:26:03,080 --> 02:26:06,080
The video game references are hilarious.

2014
02:26:06,080 --> 02:26:10,080
The gay roommate is hilarious, and so are the seven evil exes.

2015
02:26:10,080 --> 02:26:12,080
I'm going to buy the book so I can see the backstory,

2016
02:26:12,080 --> 02:26:14,080
and I'm going to buy the game also.

2017
02:26:14,080 --> 02:26:15,080
So keep up the good work, OLR.

2018
02:26:15,080 --> 02:26:17,080
Love, Geekboy2424.

2019
02:26:17,080 --> 02:26:21,080
P.S. Those of you who get the reference from K.ON,

2020
02:26:21,080 --> 02:26:24,080
I give OLR a muy muy heart cannon.

2021
02:26:24,080 --> 02:26:26,080
Wow.

2022
02:26:26,080 --> 02:26:27,080
Well, thanks.

2023
02:26:27,080 --> 02:26:28,080
I'm glad you liked the movie.

2024
02:26:28,080 --> 02:26:30,080
I didn't think it was the best movie ever,

2025
02:26:30,080 --> 02:26:34,080
but it was, it tickled the retro funny bone, I suppose.

2026
02:26:34,080 --> 02:26:36,080
You know, all that stuff.

2027
02:26:36,080 --> 02:26:37,080
There you go.

2028
02:26:37,080 --> 02:26:39,080
Next one from Troy.

2029
02:26:39,080 --> 02:26:40,080
Hi.

2030
02:26:40,080 --> 02:26:43,080
Okay, apparently you sent two, so I'm going to actually go to the,

2031
02:26:43,080 --> 02:26:45,080
see if I can find the first one.

2032
02:26:45,080 --> 02:26:47,080
Okay, maybe not.

2033
02:26:47,080 --> 02:26:49,080
I'll just go ahead and read this one.

2034
02:26:49,080 --> 02:26:53,080
Sorry for the double email, but I thought this was funny.

2035
02:26:53,080 --> 02:27:00,080
Apparently you can buy Halo Reach early for 99,999 Microsoft points.

2036
02:27:00,080 --> 02:27:02,080
Oh, somebody didn't listen to last week's show yet

2037
02:27:02,080 --> 02:27:03,080
when they sent the email.

2038
02:27:03,080 --> 02:27:04,080
Yeah.

2039
02:27:04,080 --> 02:27:06,080
Talked to all about it on last week's show.

2040
02:27:06,080 --> 02:27:08,080
And no, you can't.

2041
02:27:08,080 --> 02:27:10,080
That's much cheaper than that now.

2042
02:27:10,080 --> 02:27:11,080
Is it?

2043
02:27:11,080 --> 02:27:13,080
Yeah. Free.

2044
02:27:13,080 --> 02:27:15,080
Oh, true.

2045
02:27:15,080 --> 02:27:16,080
True.

2046
02:27:16,080 --> 02:27:19,080
But you might get banned according to an article earlier in the show.

2047
02:27:19,080 --> 02:27:21,080
Ooh, this one's for me.

2048
02:27:21,080 --> 02:27:22,080
From you?

2049
02:27:22,080 --> 02:27:23,080
For me.

2050
02:27:23,080 --> 02:27:24,080
For you?

2051
02:27:24,080 --> 02:27:25,080
Well, let's hear it.

2052
02:27:25,080 --> 02:27:26,080
Hey, OLR.

2053
02:27:26,080 --> 02:27:28,080
I'm writing in with a food related question.

2054
02:27:28,080 --> 02:27:30,080
It's labeled Orange Lounge Foodio.

2055
02:27:30,080 --> 02:27:34,080
Um, food related questions, especially for, specifically for Jamie.

2056
02:27:34,080 --> 02:27:36,080
Apologies for sending this to the show inbox,

2057
02:27:36,080 --> 02:27:38,080
but I couldn't find a way of contacting her personally.

2058
02:27:38,080 --> 02:27:39,080
Wow.

2059
02:27:39,080 --> 02:27:40,080
Well, I'll go and read it.

2060
02:27:40,080 --> 02:27:41,080
Why not?

2061
02:27:41,080 --> 02:27:42,080
Jamie.

2062
02:27:42,080 --> 02:27:44,080
We haven't had a good food derailing yet.

2063
02:27:44,080 --> 02:27:47,080
I've been working my way to better health over the past few months.

2064
02:27:47,080 --> 02:27:49,080
With the help of persistent diet and exercise,

2065
02:27:49,080 --> 02:27:52,080
I've managed to gain a healthy 25 pounds.

2066
02:27:52,080 --> 02:27:56,080
However, I've hit a rut and stopped gaining weight for about three weeks now.

2067
02:27:56,080 --> 02:27:58,080
My body has become accustomed to my diet,

2068
02:27:58,080 --> 02:28:02,080
and I need to add more to it if I want to progress.

2069
02:28:02,080 --> 02:28:06,080
Do you have any suggestions as to what foods have high amounts of calories?

2070
02:28:06,080 --> 02:28:07,080
Hmm.

2071
02:28:07,080 --> 02:28:09,080
I've been including foods such as salmon, beef, and oats into my diet.

2072
02:28:09,080 --> 02:28:12,080
Anything with healthy fats and proteins will be appreciated as well.

2073
02:28:12,080 --> 02:28:14,080
Thank you so much in advance.

2074
02:28:14,080 --> 02:28:15,080
I love the show and keep up the good work.

2075
02:28:15,080 --> 02:28:17,080
I'm not going to read the person's name,

2076
02:28:17,080 --> 02:28:19,080
but I'm sure the person knows who it is.

2077
02:28:19,080 --> 02:28:22,080
Well, you're going to want to eat fried chicken and pizza.

2078
02:28:22,080 --> 02:28:23,080
No, Rob.

2079
02:28:23,080 --> 02:28:24,080
It's gaining weight.

2080
02:28:24,080 --> 02:28:25,080
That's how I gained weight.

2081
02:28:25,080 --> 02:28:29,080
The way that my uncle did it is he ate a lot of tuna.

2082
02:28:29,080 --> 02:28:31,080
A lot of tuna.

2083
02:28:31,080 --> 02:28:35,080
Um, you can also, um,

2084
02:28:35,080 --> 02:28:40,080
Now, keep in mind, I'm going more towards the opposite direction,

2085
02:28:40,080 --> 02:28:43,080
towards the, you know, lean tissue, the losing side.

2086
02:28:43,080 --> 02:28:46,080
Um, but you can eat, um,

2087
02:28:46,080 --> 02:28:50,080
Tempe is really good to get your protein from if you want a vegetarian source.

2088
02:28:50,080 --> 02:28:55,080
Um, tofu, um, but-

2089
02:28:55,080 --> 02:28:57,080
Beefcake 3000.

2090
02:28:57,080 --> 02:28:59,080
Beefcake!

2091
02:28:59,080 --> 02:29:01,080
If you're trying to go, like, the real food route,

2092
02:29:01,080 --> 02:29:03,080
I know that the way that my uncle did it is that instead of,

2093
02:29:03,080 --> 02:29:07,080
also instead of sucrose, he used, um, fructose as a sweetener,

2094
02:29:07,080 --> 02:29:09,080
because it's a more complex sugar.

2095
02:29:09,080 --> 02:29:11,080
And, you know, more whole wheat type stuff,

2096
02:29:11,080 --> 02:29:13,080
but I'd say lots of fish.

2097
02:29:13,080 --> 02:29:14,080
Lots of fish.

2098
02:29:14,080 --> 02:29:15,080
Go get sushi.

2099
02:29:15,080 --> 02:29:17,080
A lot of sashimi.

2100
02:29:17,080 --> 02:29:20,080
And, you know, I don't know if you've got a Fuddruckers where you are.

2101
02:29:20,080 --> 02:29:22,080
I haven't seen them out in that area, but maybe they do.

2102
02:29:22,080 --> 02:29:24,080
They have elk burgers, and they're super good.

2103
02:29:24,080 --> 02:29:26,080
You can get elk and game meat.

2104
02:29:26,080 --> 02:29:29,080
Like, you can get venison at some grocery stores.

2105
02:29:29,080 --> 02:29:31,080
You can probably go hunting for it.

2106
02:29:31,080 --> 02:29:32,080
I should put out this disclaimer.

2107
02:29:32,080 --> 02:29:34,080
Jamie's not a doctor, and neither am I.

2108
02:29:34,080 --> 02:29:35,080
I am not.

2109
02:29:35,080 --> 02:29:38,080
And you really should, if you want to make sure you're doing it the right way,

2110
02:29:38,080 --> 02:29:39,080
be under a doctor's care.

2111
02:29:39,080 --> 02:29:41,080
That's what I was gonna say wrong.

2112
02:29:41,080 --> 02:29:42,080
I'm just saying.

2113
02:29:42,080 --> 02:29:43,080
I was gonna say it.

2114
02:29:43,080 --> 02:29:45,080
I just don't want to get sued.

2115
02:29:45,080 --> 02:29:47,080
I'm not a doctor.

2116
02:29:47,080 --> 02:29:49,080
I'm showing you what I've read and what other-

2117
02:29:49,080 --> 02:29:51,080
But she plays one on the internet.

2118
02:29:51,080 --> 02:29:53,080
Dr. Sakura. No.

2119
02:29:53,080 --> 02:29:55,080
She's played a lot of Trauma Center.

2120
02:29:55,080 --> 02:29:57,080
Ugh, shut up.

2121
02:29:57,080 --> 02:30:00,080
Don't make me break out the vuvuzela.

2122
02:30:00,080 --> 02:30:02,080
Anyway.

2123
02:30:02,080 --> 02:30:07,080
I'm really just passing on to you what I've observed, what I've seen other people do.

2124
02:30:07,080 --> 02:30:09,080
Really the best thing to do.

2125
02:30:09,080 --> 02:30:15,080
Which is what I was getting to before Rob stood on the soapbox.

2126
02:30:15,080 --> 02:30:17,080
Is talk to your nutritionist.

2127
02:30:17,080 --> 02:30:18,080
Find a nutritionist.

2128
02:30:18,080 --> 02:30:20,080
Do some research.

2129
02:30:20,080 --> 02:30:24,080
I'll email you back with some of my own happenings.

2130
02:30:24,080 --> 02:30:28,080
I'll make sure that you get my contact information.

2131
02:30:28,080 --> 02:30:30,080
But, um.

2132
02:30:30,080 --> 02:30:31,080
But, yeah. I mean.

2133
02:30:31,080 --> 02:30:37,080
And, of course, make sure that you do not slack off on the exercise.

2134
02:30:37,080 --> 02:30:39,080
Change your routine.

2135
02:30:39,080 --> 02:30:42,080
Unless your goal is to get a bigger butt.

2136
02:30:42,080 --> 02:30:45,080
A trainer that I talked to just the other day, actually.

2137
02:30:45,080 --> 02:30:51,080
Said that if you start hitting a rut in your, um, like your-

2138
02:30:51,080 --> 02:30:53,080
And I was kind of actually thinking about this, too.

2139
02:30:53,080 --> 02:30:55,080
Because I used to do this with DDR.

2140
02:30:55,080 --> 02:30:56,080
Okay.

2141
02:30:56,080 --> 02:31:00,080
Is that if you feel something getting too easy.

2142
02:31:00,080 --> 02:31:02,080
And, you know.

2143
02:31:02,080 --> 02:31:04,080
You can change it up. Do something that's harder.

2144
02:31:04,080 --> 02:31:06,080
Because that's how you challenge yourself, right?

2145
02:31:06,080 --> 02:31:10,080
Well, someone was bringing it up at the gym just the other day.

2146
02:31:10,080 --> 02:31:12,080
And I was hearing them talk about it.

2147
02:31:12,080 --> 02:31:15,080
And I guess the same thing would apply.

2148
02:31:15,080 --> 02:31:17,080
You know.

2149
02:31:17,080 --> 02:31:20,080
I'm not a fitness coach.

2150
02:31:20,080 --> 02:31:22,080
And if all you really want is a bigger butt.

2151
02:31:22,080 --> 02:31:24,080
Dark Soccer was looking at some stuff before the show.

2152
02:31:24,080 --> 02:31:26,080
Booty Pop Panties.

2153
02:31:26,080 --> 02:31:27,080
Just look them up. Google them.

2154
02:31:27,080 --> 02:31:29,080
Booty Pop Panties.

2155
02:31:29,080 --> 02:31:31,080
They're $20 panties.

2156
02:31:31,080 --> 02:31:32,080
They give you a bigger butt?

2157
02:31:32,080 --> 02:31:34,080
They make your butt pop.

2158
02:31:34,080 --> 02:31:35,080
Alright.

2159
02:31:35,080 --> 02:31:40,080
And apparently according to Kelly Ripa, they're really comfortable to sit on.

2160
02:31:40,080 --> 02:31:43,080
Like I'd listen to anything that chick has to say.

2161
02:31:43,080 --> 02:31:46,080
Dear OLR, first of all, congrats to Loki on the new spawn.

2162
02:31:46,080 --> 02:31:53,080
I've seen the pictures and if the kid is in fact a white guy with red hair, I might suggest sunscreen. Lots.

2163
02:31:53,080 --> 02:31:57,080
I'm talking a container of sunscreen the size of a grain cellar.

2164
02:31:57,080 --> 02:32:00,080
Second, about the marathon show, I'd be up for it.

2165
02:32:00,080 --> 02:32:03,080
I haven't been able to listen live for a while because of school and working on my book.

2166
02:32:03,080 --> 02:32:06,080
But the concept of a marathon show intrigues me.

2167
02:32:06,080 --> 02:32:10,080
Just think of all the loopy incoherent chatter we could deliver around 8 AM.

2168
02:32:10,080 --> 02:32:13,080
It'll be like the old school DDR tournament shows.

2169
02:32:13,080 --> 02:32:16,080
If you want to hear some real train wreck radio, go look at the...

2170
02:32:16,080 --> 02:32:19,080
Go try to find the show. I don't even know if it was recorded at B3.

2171
02:32:19,080 --> 02:32:23,080
Where we did like... We had to do like 20 hours of programming across two days. It was crazy.

2172
02:32:23,080 --> 02:32:27,080
Or my favorite as well was the Shaft that we did.

2173
02:32:27,080 --> 02:32:31,080
Yes, it was called Sacramento hosts another fabulous tournament.

2174
02:32:31,080 --> 02:32:33,080
Oh, that's what we said it was.

2175
02:32:33,080 --> 02:32:35,080
Yes. That was hosted at Scandia.

2176
02:32:35,080 --> 02:32:40,080
And I just remember like I was emceeing the DDR freestyle.

2177
02:32:40,080 --> 02:32:46,080
And at certain points I'd look over and there was one point where it just looked like Loki was rambling incoherently into the microphone.

2178
02:32:46,080 --> 02:32:47,080
Like I don't even know what he was saying.

2179
02:32:47,080 --> 02:32:52,080
And then at one point Jahi... God, I love that guy. I don't know where he's at these days.

2180
02:32:52,080 --> 02:32:55,080
But Jahi, like I remember looking over and he had the mic just by himself.

2181
02:32:55,080 --> 02:32:57,080
And he was just going like this...

2182
02:32:57,080 --> 02:33:01,080
Like yelling into the microphone. It seemed like I'm like...

2183
02:33:01,080 --> 02:33:04,080
Who's listening to him right now? Poor people.

2184
02:33:04,080 --> 02:33:05,080
I love Jahi.

2185
02:33:05,080 --> 02:33:06,080
Oh yeah. Good times.

2186
02:33:06,080 --> 02:33:11,080
By the way, just to note for anyone who owns an iPad, buy a Bluetooth wireless keyboard.

2187
02:33:11,080 --> 02:33:19,080
It is a better keyboard than the virtual keyboard on the iPad, doesn't move out of place like the keyboard that hooks into the iPad dock, and can be found online for 40 bucks.

2188
02:33:19,080 --> 02:33:21,080
Again, I own an iPad.

2189
02:33:21,080 --> 02:33:24,080
That's the face he made. The P.

2190
02:33:24,080 --> 02:33:25,080
So it went...

2191
02:33:25,080 --> 02:33:27,080
Staycare Redertainment.

2192
02:33:27,080 --> 02:33:32,080
This message has been brought to you by the Black Robin Christmas Carol. Insert self-indulgent plug here.

2193
02:33:32,080 --> 02:33:34,080
Sent from my iPad. Ha!

2194
02:33:34,080 --> 02:33:36,080
Last email, Rob?

2195
02:33:36,080 --> 02:33:38,080
No, actually we got two.

2196
02:33:38,080 --> 02:33:40,080
Oh, here's the other part from Troy. Sorry.

2197
02:33:40,080 --> 02:33:47,080
Hey there, OLR. I don't entirely know if you guys know how to love a cat or even if you have a pet, but you should watch this.

2198
02:33:47,080 --> 02:33:51,080
Oh, it's 100 Ways to Love a Cat.

2199
02:33:51,080 --> 02:33:53,080
Well, I'll watch it later.

2200
02:33:53,080 --> 02:33:54,080
I'll watch it later.

2201
02:33:54,080 --> 02:33:56,080
I have a cat. I have a Shermie.

2202
02:33:56,080 --> 02:33:58,080
She likes to be loved with food.

2203
02:33:58,080 --> 02:34:00,080
Um...

2204
02:34:00,080 --> 02:34:02,080
Okay, here's the last one.

2205
02:34:02,080 --> 02:34:04,080
Hi, OLR folks.

2206
02:34:04,080 --> 02:34:05,080
Hi.

2207
02:34:05,080 --> 02:34:06,080
Rob.

2208
02:34:06,080 --> 02:34:10,080
What? I'm gonna respond back. If they say hi, I gotta say hi back. I don't wanna be rude.

2209
02:34:10,080 --> 02:34:14,080
Hi, OLR folks. There was something that a friend of mine said to me that really bothered me.

2210
02:34:14,080 --> 02:34:16,080
He said I wasn't a hardcore gamer.

2211
02:34:16,080 --> 02:34:19,080
I was quite hurt by that because I always thought I was a hardcore gamer.

2212
02:34:19,080 --> 02:34:23,080
I have a PS3, Wii, DS, First Generation, Dreamcast, Gameboy Color, and N64.

2213
02:34:23,080 --> 02:34:24,080
I still win.

2214
02:34:24,080 --> 02:34:26,080
All with their original boxes.

2215
02:34:26,080 --> 02:34:31,080
I've got figurines from Soul Calibur 2, a resin statue from Space Channel 5, Mounds and Mounds of Video Games,

2216
02:34:31,080 --> 02:34:33,080
sheet music, a few video game reference t-shirts,

2217
02:34:33,080 --> 02:34:38,080
and even my screensaver and desktop wallpapers are from EchoChrome and I don't even owe the game.

2218
02:34:38,080 --> 02:34:40,080
Do you think I'm still a hardcore gamer?

2219
02:34:40,080 --> 02:34:42,080
Um...

2220
02:34:42,080 --> 02:34:44,080
Gamer is what you play, not what you own.

2221
02:34:44,080 --> 02:34:45,080
No, you're just a pussy.

2222
02:34:45,080 --> 02:34:48,080
Game is what you play, not what you own.

2223
02:34:48,080 --> 02:34:52,080
Your friend is clearly just elitist.

2224
02:34:52,080 --> 02:34:53,080
Jealous.

2225
02:34:53,080 --> 02:34:54,080
Yeah, he's just a hater.

2226
02:34:54,080 --> 02:34:55,080
He's judging you.

2227
02:34:55,080 --> 02:34:57,080
You know what? We have a saying.

2228
02:34:57,080 --> 02:34:59,080
And the saying goes like this.

2229
02:34:59,080 --> 02:35:00,080
Haters gonna hate.

2230
02:35:00,080 --> 02:35:01,080
And your friend is a hater.

2231
02:35:01,080 --> 02:35:03,080
And all he's gonna do is he's gonna hate.

2232
02:35:03,080 --> 02:35:04,080
He's judging.

2233
02:35:04,080 --> 02:35:05,080
Yeah, that's right.

2234
02:35:05,080 --> 02:35:06,080
He's judging.

2235
02:35:06,080 --> 02:35:07,080
Stop judging.

2236
02:35:07,080 --> 02:35:08,080
Right.

2237
02:35:08,080 --> 02:35:09,080
A quick bit of history about me.

2238
02:35:09,080 --> 02:35:12,080
I grew up as a 90s gamer when I was in my teens, like the rest of us.

2239
02:35:12,080 --> 02:35:15,080
I was all about fighting games, among other genres,

2240
02:35:15,080 --> 02:35:19,080
and there was no shortage of Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat clones.

2241
02:35:19,080 --> 02:35:23,080
The same was side-scrolling beat-em-up games like Simpsons Arcade and X-Men,

2242
02:35:23,080 --> 02:35:25,080
to the X-Men game was great.

2243
02:35:25,080 --> 02:35:27,080
My friend is constantly trying to get me to play Left 4 Dead,

2244
02:35:27,080 --> 02:35:30,080
and even though I don't have an Xbox 360, nor do I want one,

2245
02:35:30,080 --> 02:35:33,080
the reason I don't want to play it is because I suck at first-person shooters,

2246
02:35:33,080 --> 02:35:37,080
and I end up getting killed when I try to fight against more seasoned gamers,

2247
02:35:37,080 --> 02:35:38,080
except for Portal.

2248
02:35:38,080 --> 02:35:39,080
See, your friend's a hater.

2249
02:35:39,080 --> 02:35:41,080
I can't wait for the sequel to come out.

2250
02:35:41,080 --> 02:35:44,080
For the record, the sequel is spelled S-E-Q-U-E-L, not A-L.

2251
02:35:44,080 --> 02:35:48,080
For the past few years, FPSers have been all the rage.

2252
02:35:48,080 --> 02:35:50,080
There have been Halo clones left and right,

2253
02:35:50,080 --> 02:35:53,080
so I guess my question is, does not liking a certain genre

2254
02:35:53,080 --> 02:35:58,080
that seems to currently be the most popular make you someone less of a gamer?

2255
02:35:58,080 --> 02:36:00,080
Thank you for reading my email, Stan.

2256
02:36:00,080 --> 02:36:02,080
No, it doesn't.

2257
02:36:02,080 --> 02:36:05,080
Your friend is just being a dick.

2258
02:36:05,080 --> 02:36:07,080
Okay, can I play devil's advocate for a minute?

2259
02:36:07,080 --> 02:36:08,080
Go for it.

2260
02:36:08,080 --> 02:36:11,080
I think everybody in chat is in agreeance that his friend's just being a jerk

2261
02:36:11,080 --> 02:36:14,080
and a hater, and I think we're all saying that too,

2262
02:36:14,080 --> 02:36:16,080
but let me ask you this.

2263
02:36:16,080 --> 02:36:21,080
Using this same logic, is somebody that plays Facebook games

2264
02:36:21,080 --> 02:36:28,080
and Farmville and Bejeweled Blitz and Imagine Cat Shop and Just Dance,

2265
02:36:28,080 --> 02:36:30,080
are they a gamer?

2266
02:36:30,080 --> 02:36:33,080
I don't think Facebook games count.

2267
02:36:33,080 --> 02:36:34,080
Really?

2268
02:36:34,080 --> 02:36:41,080
Now, if you're playing Bejeweled on a handheld system, that's a game.

2269
02:36:41,080 --> 02:36:44,080
See, okay, well, here's the definition.

2270
02:36:44,080 --> 02:36:47,080
You've got your casual games, right?

2271
02:36:47,080 --> 02:36:52,080
Which, they're technically, yes, they're games.

2272
02:36:52,080 --> 02:36:58,080
But I think that the actual definition of gamer as far as what is socially considered a gamer

2273
02:36:58,080 --> 02:37:02,080
has to do specifically with PC and console games.

2274
02:37:02,080 --> 02:37:07,080
Not flash-based games, if you know what I mean,

2275
02:37:07,080 --> 02:37:14,080
but, like, installing said game on hard drive playing, you know, against people.

2276
02:37:14,080 --> 02:37:18,080
The more, the higher intensity stuff.

2277
02:37:18,080 --> 02:37:25,080
I think multiplayer games, you know, again, installed content, console type things,

2278
02:37:25,080 --> 02:37:29,080
yes, those count. That's a gamer.

2279
02:37:29,080 --> 02:37:36,080
But if you play mostly puzzlers and things, you're gonna be looped into that casual category.

2280
02:37:36,080 --> 02:37:42,080
And I think that hardcore, if I'm gonna even go a bit further into generalizations,

2281
02:37:42,080 --> 02:37:55,080
we're looking at a very, what's the word that I'm thinking of, gender related type of theme.

2282
02:37:55,080 --> 02:38:01,080
I think I can, I wanna try and nail down this definition a lot quicker.

2283
02:38:01,080 --> 02:38:05,080
I think a gamer is someone who has an appreciation for game culture.

2284
02:38:05,080 --> 02:38:07,080
It's a gaming enthusiast.

2285
02:38:07,080 --> 02:38:11,080
If you enter the trouble to download this podcast and email it,

2286
02:38:11,080 --> 02:38:14,080
you care about games enough, I think you're a gamer.

2287
02:38:14,080 --> 02:38:18,080
If you have ever bought a gaming magazine off the shelf,

2288
02:38:18,080 --> 02:38:20,080
you have an interest in gaming culture, you're a gamer.

2289
02:38:20,080 --> 02:38:22,080
We do have non-gamers that listen, by the way.

2290
02:38:22,080 --> 02:38:28,080
And that's possible, sure. We probably have a lot of food fans at the rate this show's going.

2291
02:38:28,080 --> 02:38:35,080
If you are somebody who has ever watched a television program about video games

2292
02:38:35,080 --> 02:38:39,080
because you are interested in the content, you're probably a gamer.

2293
02:38:39,080 --> 02:38:43,080
I think a gamer is just somebody who has an active interest in gaming culture.

2294
02:38:43,080 --> 02:38:48,080
And somebody who does Farmville and That's It probably really isn't a gamer

2295
02:38:48,080 --> 02:38:52,080
because they don't have an interest in the culture of games and why we play them.

2296
02:38:52,080 --> 02:38:53,080
They're someone that just plays games.

2297
02:38:53,080 --> 02:38:56,080
And what motivates us and what keeps our interest, you know what I mean?

2298
02:38:56,080 --> 02:39:02,080
Well, it's like, you know, the other definition of gamer is, of course, tabletop.

2299
02:39:02,080 --> 02:39:08,080
But, you know, it's like I can sit down, when I play Monopoly, am I playing a game?

2300
02:39:08,080 --> 02:39:11,080
I'm playing as much of a game as I am playing Street Fighter.

2301
02:39:11,080 --> 02:39:13,080
It's a game. It's for entertainment.

2302
02:39:13,080 --> 02:39:16,080
But I don't collect Monopoly memorabilia.

2303
02:39:16,080 --> 02:39:20,080
So, I'm not a board gamer, I guess.

2304
02:39:20,080 --> 02:39:26,080
That's what I'm trying to look at it is by, and to put it back to this way,

2305
02:39:26,080 --> 02:39:30,080
it's not what you have, it's what you do with it.

2306
02:39:30,080 --> 02:39:32,080
Okay, that sounded dirty.

2307
02:39:32,080 --> 02:39:35,080
It's the games that you have, the games that you enjoy.

2308
02:39:35,080 --> 02:39:40,080
And if you play them all the time, that's pretty hardcore, you know.

2309
02:39:40,080 --> 02:39:45,080
And if you make it a part of your life, like you were saying,

2310
02:39:45,080 --> 02:39:48,080
if you make it a part of your life, then you're a gamer.

2311
02:39:48,080 --> 02:39:50,080
And your friend's a hater.

2312
02:39:50,080 --> 02:39:53,080
And your friend's a hater. Your friend's just judging you.

2313
02:39:53,080 --> 02:39:54,080
All right.

2314
02:39:54,080 --> 02:39:57,080
And Tigerclaw in our chatroom says this.

2315
02:39:57,080 --> 02:40:01,080
If this so-called friend had been saying that, all that, then that is not a friend at all.

2316
02:40:01,080 --> 02:40:07,080
You get the impression that they don't want to be around you just because you like games that they don't.

2317
02:40:07,080 --> 02:40:09,080
I don't know if it's necessarily that severe,

2318
02:40:09,080 --> 02:40:14,080
but your friend just kind of, in regards to this topic, needs to pull his head out of his butt.

2319
02:40:14,080 --> 02:40:15,080
Tiara told me something funny.

2320
02:40:15,080 --> 02:40:16,080
What's that?

2321
02:40:16,080 --> 02:40:21,080
If you're playing Monopoly, you may not be a board gamer, you might be a board gamer.

2322
02:40:21,080 --> 02:40:24,080
Ah, play on words.

2323
02:40:24,080 --> 02:40:27,080
She's a grammar enthusiast. All right.

2324
02:40:27,080 --> 02:40:28,080
Anyhow.

2325
02:40:28,080 --> 02:40:31,080
I get pretty bored once, you know, all the big streets are bought up.

2326
02:40:31,080 --> 02:40:32,080
Is that it for the mailbag?

2327
02:40:32,080 --> 02:40:33,080
It's over!

2328
02:40:33,080 --> 02:40:36,080
Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

2329
02:40:36,080 --> 02:40:37,080
The mailbag is closed.

2330
02:40:37,080 --> 02:40:43,080
It's time for us to do a little bit of ranting in a segment we like to call The F-Years of the Week.

2331
02:40:43,080 --> 02:41:08,080
I have a number of FUs, but one of them is...

2332
02:41:08,080 --> 02:41:11,080
What was I ranting about when you guys came in today?

2333
02:41:11,080 --> 02:41:13,080
I don't remember.

2334
02:41:13,080 --> 02:41:15,080
I don't remember.

2335
02:41:15,080 --> 02:41:17,080
I don't remember.

2336
02:41:17,080 --> 02:41:18,080
Just...

2337
02:41:18,080 --> 02:41:22,080
When I came in here, you were talking about those booty shorts.

2338
02:41:22,080 --> 02:41:23,080
Well, okay.

2339
02:41:23,080 --> 02:41:30,080
I've got a lot of really good stuff happening to me this week, so I'd say FU to not having enough time.

2340
02:41:30,080 --> 02:41:34,080
And stupid drivers!

2341
02:41:34,080 --> 02:41:40,080
I also say an FU to lack of time, especially since I have to take care of the baby and I don't sleep very much anymore.

2342
02:41:40,080 --> 02:41:45,080
I go to bed at, like, 11 and I have to wake up again to feed him.

2343
02:41:45,080 --> 02:41:52,080
Like, last night, I actually was trying to go to bed at, like, 9 because I anticipate getting up way early in the morning.

2344
02:41:52,080 --> 02:42:01,080
And so I tried to put him down at 10 and he just kept fussing and would not go to sleep until about midnight.

2345
02:42:01,080 --> 02:42:08,080
And that sucked and I had to get up again every couple hours and then wake up usually with him around 4 o'clock in the morning.

2346
02:42:08,080 --> 02:42:14,080
Or 5 o'clock in the morning, sometimes 6 o'clock in the morning, and we're up until I have to go to work.

2347
02:42:14,080 --> 02:42:19,080
So, you know, multiply that times infinite.

2348
02:42:19,080 --> 02:42:21,080
And it really sucks.

2349
02:42:21,080 --> 02:42:26,080
But just the lack of time to actually get to work on my grandpa thought of mods and stuff like that.

2350
02:42:26,080 --> 02:42:29,080
And also an FU to just plain shitty drivers.

2351
02:42:29,080 --> 02:42:31,080
I was behind this old...

2352
02:42:31,080 --> 02:42:33,080
Well, I thought it was an old man. I ended up being an old woman.

2353
02:42:33,080 --> 02:42:39,080
But she was obviously lost and didn't know where she was going or she was looking for a turn of some sort.

2354
02:42:39,080 --> 02:42:43,080
And so she was driving really slow and then finally it was funny and kind of ironic.

2355
02:42:43,080 --> 02:42:48,080
Blew through a red light and then it got caught by the red light camera.

2356
02:42:48,080 --> 02:42:54,080
So a little bit of karma justice there, but I just hate people that do that kind of stuff.

2357
02:42:54,080 --> 02:42:55,080
Or just blow through stop signs.

2358
02:42:55,080 --> 02:42:57,080
I ran into somebody in a parking lot.

2359
02:42:57,080 --> 02:43:01,080
Well, they didn't really run into them, but they just blew right through the stop sign.

2360
02:43:01,080 --> 02:43:03,080
Like, oh, it doesn't apply to me.

2361
02:43:03,080 --> 02:43:09,080
So, you know, FU to those people and FU to the stupid young modders on sevensins.com.

2362
02:43:09,080 --> 02:43:15,080
Because, my God, you treat this shit like it's high school with all the fucking drama and stuff.

2363
02:43:15,080 --> 02:43:19,080
Some people are asking questions and you're like, well, I'm too good to answer your fucking questions.

2364
02:43:19,080 --> 02:43:22,080
So, you know, fuck them.

2365
02:43:22,080 --> 02:43:26,080
And fuck you for deleting my post just because I'm explaining how to do things.

2366
02:43:26,080 --> 02:43:30,080
Because you want to claim to be the first person that's ever done this thing.

2367
02:43:30,080 --> 02:43:34,080
Maybe you should stop hanging on web forums with fourteen and fifteen year old boys.

2368
02:43:34,080 --> 02:43:37,080
Well, I try not to, but it's very limited.

2369
02:43:37,080 --> 02:43:45,080
You know, modding the Xbox 360 version of Grand Theft Auto, it's very limited in the amount of message boards out there for that.

2370
02:43:45,080 --> 02:43:51,080
Trust me, if there was a different source, a more mature forum that I could go to, I would love to be there.

2371
02:43:51,080 --> 02:43:55,080
Do you think anyone from that forum might listen to this show and just go post over there?

2372
02:43:55,080 --> 02:43:56,080
No, I don't care.

2373
02:43:56,080 --> 02:44:00,080
This asshole on this internet radio station.

2374
02:44:00,080 --> 02:44:01,080
I really don't care.

2375
02:44:01,080 --> 02:44:05,080
My FU of the week, really not hard to figure out this week.

2376
02:44:05,080 --> 02:44:10,080
I'm a little angsty and would like to give a big FU to the fact that my trip got cancelled.

2377
02:44:10,080 --> 02:44:19,080
And it wasn't just the fact that a plane caught fire, but it was the fact that, you know, we ended up getting rerouted to another flight that was delayed for like three hours.

2378
02:44:19,080 --> 02:44:22,080
And it's kind of like they could have given us a better heads up about the delay.

2379
02:44:22,080 --> 02:44:23,080
I was a little irritated.

2380
02:44:23,080 --> 02:44:26,080
Some parts of that situation just seemed preventable.

2381
02:44:26,080 --> 02:44:33,080
I'm a pretty resilient person, and I like to think I was able to let that situation kind of roll off my back as kind of like one of those funny life experiences.

2382
02:44:33,080 --> 02:44:39,080
But I did feel really bad for my friend, who it was supposed to be a birthday trip for her, and it's just, you know, really bummed out about it.

2383
02:44:39,080 --> 02:44:41,080
And I can understand.

2384
02:44:41,080 --> 02:44:43,080
Kind of sucks to have that happen.

2385
02:44:43,080 --> 02:44:47,080
So, just FU to shit happening.

2386
02:44:47,080 --> 02:44:49,080
Because sometimes it does.

2387
02:44:49,080 --> 02:44:53,080
Shit happens, or anything you can do about it.

2388
02:44:53,080 --> 02:44:55,080
Alright, meanwhile, back to the show.

2389
02:44:55,080 --> 02:44:58,080
Couple news stories for you guys, and then the Skypline!

2390
02:44:58,080 --> 02:45:00,080
Yes, it's kind of interesting.

2391
02:45:00,080 --> 02:45:04,080
There is a whole trademark dispute over Mafia Wars.

2392
02:45:04,080 --> 02:45:12,080
Digital Chocolate is claiming that they had the trademark Mafia Wars for their, I believe it's an iPhone game.

2393
02:45:12,080 --> 02:45:18,080
And then of course, you know, Zynga has their Mafia Wars game that came out later on.

2394
02:45:18,080 --> 02:45:21,080
That was on Facebook and PC and whatnot.

2395
02:45:21,080 --> 02:45:29,080
And of course, now, you know, their Mafia Wars game has all sorts of different marketing with, you know, 7-Eleven and that kind of stuff.

2396
02:45:29,080 --> 02:45:38,080
It says, um, the United States Patent and Trademark Office lists Zynga's first filing date for the game under the name Mafia Wars as July 1, 2009.

2397
02:45:38,080 --> 02:45:49,080
Although no filing under that name could be located with Digital Chocolate as the applicant, Digital Chocolate has not responded, of course, to the request by Joystick in this case.

2398
02:45:49,080 --> 02:45:52,080
Um, of course, you know, it's...

2399
02:45:52,080 --> 02:45:58,080
I don't know if it's a case that they didn't trademark the name, which would kind of suck for them.

2400
02:45:58,080 --> 02:46:03,080
But, I mean, the game did clearly come out before the Zynga version of Mafia Wars.

2401
02:46:03,080 --> 02:46:06,080
So, you know, they're going to court over that now.

2402
02:46:06,080 --> 02:46:08,080
Settlement. Yeah.

2403
02:46:08,080 --> 02:46:13,080
It's where these things always end up. Some type of out-of-court settlement. I'm sure.

2404
02:46:13,080 --> 02:46:15,080
Alright.

2405
02:46:15,080 --> 02:46:19,080
Anyhow, one more story for you guys. I guess I should get that Skype line ready to go, shouldn't I?

2406
02:46:19,080 --> 02:46:24,080
Alright, uh, 1877 game O-L-R, username is skypeazorgen. I don't know if you want to start calling.

2407
02:46:24,080 --> 02:46:26,080
But meanwhile, I got one more song...er, one more song.

2408
02:46:26,080 --> 02:46:32,080
One more story for you guys and this is very interesting and it's one of those things I looked at and I was like, really? Is this real life?

2409
02:46:32,080 --> 02:46:33,080
I don't even know.

2410
02:46:33,080 --> 02:46:35,080
What is this? I cannot even.

2411
02:46:35,080 --> 02:46:42,080
It's a game called The Bible Online. That's right. This is real.

2412
02:46:42,080 --> 02:46:54,080
It's a game called The Bible Online where you will get to slip into the role of Abraham and his descendants and have the opportunity to reenact and witness the incidents of their times.

2413
02:46:54,080 --> 02:46:58,080
The game will be split into chapters. The heroes will be the first one that comes out.

2414
02:46:58,080 --> 02:47:04,080
It's basically an MMO strategy game. You control your own tribe, you build a city, you wage war in the name of God.

2415
02:47:04,080 --> 02:47:14,080
I see why I mean, like, this almost sounds like a joke. Like, I just don't even get it but apparently there's a website. It's thebible-onlinegame.com.

2416
02:47:14,080 --> 02:47:21,080
Complete with side quests, role-playing elements and, uh, there you go. That's what it's all about.

2417
02:47:21,080 --> 02:47:27,080
No word yet if there's gonna be, you know, other religious texts. Um, what?

2418
02:47:27,080 --> 02:47:31,080
Have you actually looked at the screen captures on it? I did.

2419
02:47:31,080 --> 02:47:32,080
Yeah?

2420
02:47:32,080 --> 02:47:33,080
It's super dinky.

2421
02:47:33,080 --> 02:47:37,080
I almost think it, like, it's not real. Like, I just...

2422
02:47:37,080 --> 02:47:38,080
No, it is. It's real.

2423
02:47:38,080 --> 02:47:39,080
Wow.

2424
02:47:39,080 --> 02:47:45,080
There's a beta sign up. It's just, it's dinky. It's like, it reminds me even of a, like, a late 90s strategy game.

2425
02:47:45,080 --> 02:47:46,080
Where's Bibleville?

2426
02:47:46,080 --> 02:47:53,080
What? Are they gonna have a, uh, the Quran online? Are they gonna, are they gonna be equal opportunity and do a Quran online?

2427
02:47:53,080 --> 02:47:55,080
No.

2428
02:47:55,080 --> 02:47:58,080
Just don't put it too close to ground zero.

2429
02:47:58,080 --> 02:48:04,080
Anyhow. Moving on. Are you making food? Are you making me food?

2430
02:48:04,080 --> 02:48:05,080
Do you want a taco?

2431
02:48:05,080 --> 02:48:06,080
I don't want a taco. I'm fine.

2432
02:48:06,080 --> 02:48:08,080
I've been sitting here hungry.

2433
02:48:08,080 --> 02:48:09,080
Then make a taco.

2434
02:48:09,080 --> 02:48:10,080
Watching Linky eat.

2435
02:48:10,080 --> 02:48:12,080
Fine. I'll take calls without you.

2436
02:48:12,080 --> 02:48:15,080
I'll be in here a pack of taco. I'm also making my taco. Do you want me to make you a taco?

2437
02:48:15,080 --> 02:48:16,080
No, I don't want a taco.

2438
02:48:16,080 --> 02:48:17,080
Then fine. I'll be right back.

2439
02:48:17,080 --> 02:48:18,080
Fine.

2440
02:48:18,080 --> 02:48:19,080
Taco!

2441
02:48:19,080 --> 02:48:20,080
Do you want to send Dan in? Maybe Dan wants to talk to some listeners.

2442
02:48:20,080 --> 02:48:22,080
Dan, you wanna talk to some listeners?

2443
02:48:22,080 --> 02:48:24,080
Let's just have Dan answer the phones tonight.

2444
02:48:24,080 --> 02:48:27,080
Dan, come answer the phones.

2445
02:48:27,080 --> 02:48:29,080
He's busy playing something.

2446
02:48:29,080 --> 02:48:30,080
What's he playing? Do you know?

2447
02:48:30,080 --> 02:48:31,080
I don't know.

2448
02:48:31,080 --> 02:48:32,080
Oh, he's coming.

2449
02:48:32,080 --> 02:48:33,080
What are you playing?

2450
02:48:33,080 --> 02:48:35,080
Hey Dan. Dan, you wanna answer the phones tonight?

2451
02:48:35,080 --> 02:48:36,080
Yes.

2452
02:48:36,080 --> 02:48:37,080
Alright, Skypline with Dan.

2453
02:48:37,080 --> 02:48:41,080
Alright, so you're just gonna say, hi, this is Orange Lounge Radio. This is Dan. What do you want?

2454
02:48:41,080 --> 02:48:42,080
Okay, just fear me.

2455
02:48:42,080 --> 02:48:49,080
Alright, here we go. Skypline with Dan tonight. 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2456
02:48:49,080 --> 02:48:50,080
You ready to go to the phones, Dan?

2457
02:48:50,080 --> 02:48:51,080
Let's do it.

2458
02:48:51,080 --> 02:48:54,080
Here we go. Here's the first call.

2459
02:48:54,080 --> 02:48:57,080
Hello, this is Orange Lounge Radio. Sup?

2460
02:48:57,080 --> 02:49:01,080
Hey, this is DJ Blaziken.

2461
02:49:01,080 --> 02:49:03,080
This is who?

2462
02:49:03,080 --> 02:49:05,080
DJ Blaziken.

2463
02:49:05,080 --> 02:49:06,080
DJ Blaziken.

2464
02:49:06,080 --> 02:49:07,080
DJ Blaziken.

2465
02:49:07,080 --> 02:49:12,080
Oh, good. Good to hear from you. What's up, man? How you doing? What can we do for you?

2466
02:49:12,080 --> 02:49:18,080
Uh, it's not much. I just got done with a Silent Hill in the dark session.

2467
02:49:18,080 --> 02:49:20,080
Wow.

2468
02:49:20,080 --> 02:49:24,080
Creepy as hell. Even though despite I unplugged my 60s audio cables...

2469
02:49:24,080 --> 02:49:26,080
Now the question is, did you have surround sound?

2470
02:49:26,080 --> 02:49:36,080
Um, I'm playing Homecoming for the 360 and I actually unplugged the 360 audio cables and plugged in my PSP audio cables for the stream.

2471
02:49:36,080 --> 02:49:40,080
And so basically I'm listening to you guys while playing Silent Hill.

2472
02:49:40,080 --> 02:49:49,080
I kind of get rid of the sound of the creepiness, but monsters coming out of the woodwork nowhere makes you jump out of my chair.

2473
02:49:49,080 --> 02:49:53,080
It's a giant mistake because Silent Hill is well known for its incredible sound design.

2474
02:49:53,080 --> 02:49:59,080
You play that on, like, surround sound system in the dark, it's going to fuck you up for life.

2475
02:49:59,080 --> 02:50:03,080
Oh, trust me. I've been screwed for life by Silent Hill years ago.

2476
02:50:03,080 --> 02:50:06,080
Yeah, I trust you, but I don't really want to hear about it.

2477
02:50:06,080 --> 02:50:11,080
No, no, no. It was back on the old PlayStation 1. I played it probably... I played a demo.

2478
02:50:11,080 --> 02:50:13,080
Hey, I'm in the middle of a call.

2479
02:50:13,080 --> 02:50:23,080
The demo of Silent Hill 1 basically creeped me the heck out when I was, like, 10. Okay?

2480
02:50:23,080 --> 02:50:28,080
You know, you probably shouldn't have been playing that when you were 10. It must mean your parents don't care about you.

2481
02:50:28,080 --> 02:50:32,080
I gotta go. I'm being kicked out of the room.

2482
02:50:32,080 --> 02:50:33,080
All right.

2483
02:50:33,080 --> 02:50:36,080
It's good to hear from you. And, uh...

2484
02:50:36,080 --> 02:50:37,080
Give me that!

2485
02:50:37,080 --> 02:50:38,080
Stay black.

2486
02:50:38,080 --> 02:50:39,080
What?

2487
02:50:39,080 --> 02:50:43,080
Give me the call. Take care. Bye. I don't know. Bye.

2488
02:50:43,080 --> 02:50:48,080
That's my husband. I have to live with this.

2489
02:50:48,080 --> 02:50:53,080
Did he really just end that call with, stay black? Is that...

2490
02:50:53,080 --> 02:50:58,080
I don't even...

2491
02:50:58,080 --> 02:51:03,080
Did it occur to you that he's not black, Dan?

2492
02:51:03,080 --> 02:51:10,080
All right. Moving on. Let's take another call. I guess Dan left the room. Let's move on.

2493
02:51:10,080 --> 02:51:12,080
Hi, here on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

2494
02:51:12,080 --> 02:51:19,080
This is Ron Mudd. I want to know... Did you do that on purpose or what? I mean, really. That was just excellent timing.

2495
02:51:19,080 --> 02:51:21,080
Do what on purpose?

2496
02:51:21,080 --> 02:51:24,080
Rob, you know exactly what I'm talking about. No chat room knows.

2497
02:51:24,080 --> 02:51:29,080
Oh. No, but I would have closed the phone call with that if you want, but...

2498
02:51:29,080 --> 02:51:36,080
Actually, Dan just yelled from the living room, Rama, stay black.

2499
02:51:36,080 --> 02:51:38,080
Tell him to stay white.

2500
02:51:38,080 --> 02:51:47,080
You know, Rama says to stay white. You know, I didn't think that was something that could be changed very easily unless you're like Ted Danson at a, you know...

2501
02:51:47,080 --> 02:51:49,080
I think it has to do with those old 70s movies.

2502
02:51:49,080 --> 02:51:50,080
All right, well...

2503
02:51:50,080 --> 02:51:54,080
Because keep in mind, it's like the Hebrew hammer. There's a line, Shlomo, stay Jewish.

2504
02:51:54,080 --> 02:52:00,080
Once in a while, it's a video game talk show. I don't know if you've played any games this week, Rama, but...

2505
02:52:00,080 --> 02:52:07,080
I have. I have been playing Scott Pilgrim vs. the World for the last four to five days.

2506
02:52:07,080 --> 02:52:13,080
You know, I played the demo actually this week. I didn't talk about it because I got consumed with the Laura Croft game, but what do you think?

2507
02:52:13,080 --> 02:52:20,080
Anyone that loves River City Ransom, get your ass on Xbox Live or PlayStation Network and get this game. That's it.

2508
02:52:20,080 --> 02:52:24,080
It really, it's just River City Ransom 2, isn't it? It really is.

2509
02:52:24,080 --> 02:52:33,080
With all the gaming references, my God. I mean, I'm a type of person where I will play through a game and like, I'm pretty much done with it, won't pick it up again.

2510
02:52:33,080 --> 02:52:45,080
I fl, first day, me and my roommate, we finished the game in four and a half hours. Couple of days later, I jump on the game and plow right through it, and I played through the game again last night to like 4.30 in the morning.

2511
02:52:45,080 --> 02:52:51,080
It's a good time. That's like me on the Laura Croft game, but obviously this is, you know, for different reasons.

2512
02:52:51,080 --> 02:52:56,080
Is it just the nostalgia factor that's getting you, or are you really having fun just kind of button mashing and beating them up?

2513
02:52:56,080 --> 02:53:02,080
All of that. I mean, hell, I actually went out and bought an arcade fighter joystick just to play this game with.

2514
02:53:02,080 --> 02:53:03,080
Wow.

2515
02:53:03,080 --> 02:53:06,080
And I just automatically adjusted to the joystick and played through the game.

2516
02:53:06,080 --> 02:53:07,080
That is hardcore.

2517
02:53:07,080 --> 02:53:08,080
Yes.

2518
02:53:08,080 --> 02:53:22,080
That's awesome. Well, tell us a little bit about how the game kind of changes as it progresses, because something I noticed, like, in the demo I was playing, I was like, okay, well, this is kind of, you know, repetitive, it's button mashing, da-da-da.

2519
02:53:22,080 --> 02:53:25,080
But then I noticed, like, as you level up, oh, you start getting new moves.

2520
02:53:25,080 --> 02:53:26,080
Yes.

2521
02:53:26,080 --> 02:53:32,080
And then as you go into the shops, you can kind of enhance the strength and so forth. Does that kind of evolution continue as you move on?

2522
02:53:32,080 --> 02:53:41,080
Yes, something like that. Like, as every level goes on, the game gets progressively harder and harder, but you get more coins and more money.

2523
02:53:41,080 --> 02:53:46,080
Okay. So did you beat the game, or are you done with the game yet?

2524
02:53:46,080 --> 02:53:56,080
Yeah, me and my roommate, we finished the game, then I went through and beat the game twice, so I got two more times to go through the game so I can unlock the hidden character.

2525
02:53:56,080 --> 02:54:01,080
Ah, I was going to ask what the incentive is for multiple replay, but it's hidden characters then.

2526
02:54:01,080 --> 02:54:11,080
That, and when I looked at the lead divorce of my friends, I was determined to pretty much get to the top of the ladder out of my friends list, which I did.

2527
02:54:11,080 --> 02:54:17,080
Last I recall, I'm ranked, like, 2200, and everybody else is, like, in the 4000s.

2528
02:54:17,080 --> 02:54:21,080
That still means there's 2199 people better than you.

2529
02:54:21,080 --> 02:54:25,080
That means I'm going to have to go through every single one of them to get to the top.

2530
02:54:25,080 --> 02:54:26,080
That's right.

2531
02:54:26,080 --> 02:54:33,080
Number one guy has, like, over nine million dollars in the game on the vault. I've got my work cut out for myself.

2532
02:54:33,080 --> 02:54:37,080
It's a good thing he's not playing Final Fantasy XIV, or he would have got cut off by now.

2533
02:54:37,080 --> 02:54:41,080
Alright, any other thoughts for our listeners tonight, Rama, before I take some more calls?

2534
02:54:41,080 --> 02:54:50,080
I was going to talk about the whole online passing, but we'll save that for another time, because that's, like, another ten minutes of me ranting and losing my mind.

2535
02:54:50,080 --> 02:54:55,080
Alright, well, no problem. I'm sure there'll sadly be more stories on it as we move on.

2536
02:54:55,080 --> 02:54:58,080
There's folks asking for your gamertag in chat, so you might want to share.

2537
02:54:58,080 --> 02:55:01,080
Oh, I'll type it out in the chat room right now.

2538
02:55:01,080 --> 02:55:06,080
Alright, well, Rama, thank you so much for calling in. Have a great week, and of course, stay black, my friend.

2539
02:55:06,080 --> 02:55:07,080
L'chaim!

2540
02:55:07,080 --> 02:55:08,080
Alright, take care.

2541
02:55:11,080 --> 02:55:15,080
Let's go to the phones and take another call. Hi, you're on...

2542
02:55:15,080 --> 02:55:17,080
I had my mouth full of taco.

2543
02:55:17,080 --> 02:55:20,080
You had your mouth full? Was that a taco left? Alright, I've got another call.

2544
02:55:20,080 --> 02:55:22,080
Hi, you're on Ordnance Launch Radio. Who's this?

2545
02:55:22,080 --> 02:55:23,080
Hey, it's Tiara.

2546
02:55:23,080 --> 02:55:26,080
Tiara, my friend. Long time, no chat. How are you?

2547
02:55:26,080 --> 02:55:28,080
I'm doing very good. How are you?

2548
02:55:28,080 --> 02:55:31,080
I am great, but I'd be better if I was in Vegas.

2549
02:55:31,080 --> 02:55:39,080
Oh, yeah, and speaking of Vegas, the reason I called is because I have to tell you about the This is Vegas game.

2550
02:55:39,080 --> 02:55:40,080
Yes.

2551
02:55:40,080 --> 02:55:46,080
The reason that they're not making it anymore is because I had to send out a cease and desist letter because they were copying my life.

2552
02:55:46,080 --> 02:55:47,080
What?

2553
02:55:47,080 --> 02:55:56,080
Yeah, I mean, I didn't mind, you know, the dancing, the gambling, you know, going out on the strip, but when they got to the part with punching people, I had to draw a line.

2554
02:55:56,080 --> 02:56:03,080
I see. So, basically, because it was an unauthorized biography of Tiara, you had to cease and desist them.

2555
02:56:03,080 --> 02:56:04,080
Exactly.

2556
02:56:04,080 --> 02:56:08,080
Ruining gamer dreams everywhere. How dare you?

2557
02:56:08,080 --> 02:56:13,080
I know. I also had to put a stop on Boobville, so that's the reason there's no Boobville.

2558
02:56:13,080 --> 02:56:16,080
Damn it! You ruined everything!

2559
02:56:16,080 --> 02:56:24,080
I'm also angry with you because I did not know that there was a Price is Right game on Facebook until you posted about that.

2560
02:56:24,080 --> 02:56:30,080
I didn't know about it until I posted about it. I mean, maybe I played once or twice, but yes, there is a Price is Right game on Facebook.

2561
02:56:30,080 --> 02:56:37,080
Yeah, and I played it, and I played it for a while, and it was like, it sucked up a couple of hours of my life because it's kind of addicting.

2562
02:56:37,080 --> 02:56:41,080
It is very addicting, which is weird because it's kind of stupid.

2563
02:56:41,080 --> 02:56:42,080
It really is.

2564
02:56:42,080 --> 02:56:53,080
And I'm like, this game is so stupid, but I keep hoping that I'll get picked to play Clock Game, and then I'm like, ooh, if I get to level 5, I'll get to unlock a new pricing game, and I'm really excited about that.

2565
02:56:53,080 --> 02:56:55,080
Why? Because I'm a sad person.

2566
02:56:55,080 --> 02:56:56,080
Do you have Plinko?

2567
02:56:56,080 --> 02:57:03,080
Not yet. All they have, all I ever see, well, the game is still in beta, but all I ever see is Clock Game and Safe Crackers.

2568
02:57:03,080 --> 02:57:05,080
Yeah, I always get Safe Crackers.

2569
02:57:05,080 --> 02:57:22,080
There's another one you get to unlock at level 5, but I have found that I am a terrible shopper. I have yet to be called up to play a pricing game, but, but, but, this is important, I am an awesome wheel spinner, and I almost always get 95 cents or a dollar, just saying.

2570
02:57:22,080 --> 02:57:39,080
Oh, nice. Yeah, I always weigh underbid. Like, the things that they are selling, or that they have for bid, it's like, nobody's going to pay as much money as the game says, and it seems like it's way more overpriced than the actual Prices Right television show, you know?

2571
02:57:39,080 --> 02:57:52,080
You just have to remember, real people like you and me shop at places like IKEA and Target, and the Prices Right apparently buys all of their stuff at the Galleria, you know, Versace, and all that good stuff.

2572
02:57:52,080 --> 02:57:54,080
Apparently so, yeah.

2573
02:57:54,080 --> 02:57:55,080
They shop at Whole Foods.

2574
02:57:55,080 --> 02:57:57,080
Anyways, I just wanted to call and say hi.

2575
02:57:57,080 --> 02:57:58,080
Well, thank you so much for the phone call.

2576
02:57:58,080 --> 02:58:01,080
I'll tell you the story behind the This is Vegas.

2577
02:58:01,080 --> 02:58:08,080
Well, I appreciate it. I wish you would stop ruining the dreams of gamers everywhere, but maybe you'll let us have something fun in the future?

2578
02:58:08,080 --> 02:58:12,080
Well, you guys can come down to Vegas, and I'll show you around.

2579
02:58:12,080 --> 02:58:18,080
You know what I would love to do if I don't have anything else planned this year? I would love to take, like, a Christmas trip to Vegas.

2580
02:58:18,080 --> 02:58:20,080
Yeah, that would be fun.

2581
02:58:20,080 --> 02:58:23,080
Christmas ain't no big deal to you anymore, right? Let's go.

2582
02:58:23,080 --> 02:58:31,080
I actually, depending on if I get a certain house, oh, I'm shopping for a house, so if I get one with an extra bedroom, you could probably even crash.

2583
02:58:31,080 --> 02:58:32,080
That would be awesome.

2584
02:58:32,080 --> 02:58:41,080
Oh, yes, and just so the chat knows, yes, Tiara has some type of clicking sound in the background. We'll just say Clicky the pen is trying to infiltrate Orange Lounge Radio. We'll just leave it at that. I don't know what that's all about.

2585
02:58:41,080 --> 02:58:42,080
Damn Clicky.

2586
02:58:42,080 --> 02:58:43,080
Damn Clicky.

2587
02:58:43,080 --> 02:58:45,080
It returned. The ghost was Clicky past.

2588
02:58:45,080 --> 02:58:53,080
Yeah, I don't know. This mic is very, very crazy with the clicking. Sometimes it comes up, sometimes it just randomly disappears.

2589
02:58:53,080 --> 02:59:01,080
I think it's actually the doctor is coming to kidnap me, and it's the sonic screwdriver, but it's malfunctioning, so it makes a Clicky noise instead of a...

2590
02:59:01,080 --> 02:59:04,080
Well, you did get possessed by the Daleks earlier.

2591
02:59:04,080 --> 02:59:10,080
I thought maybe it was like, you know, she's like Bob Dole where she clutches the pen all day, and she's just clicking it because she's nervous about...

2592
02:59:10,080 --> 02:59:14,080
Well, you missed when she got invaded by Daleks earlier.

2593
02:59:14,080 --> 02:59:15,080
Yeah.

2594
02:59:15,080 --> 02:59:16,080
Is that on the other...

2595
02:59:16,080 --> 02:59:17,080
We were recording our other podcast.

2596
02:59:17,080 --> 02:59:21,080
Am I allowed to talk about that? Oh, you just did, so I can't.

2597
02:59:21,080 --> 02:59:25,080
We're doing another podcast. You're going to plug it?

2598
02:59:25,080 --> 02:59:27,080
Is it the Giggling Girl comic show again?

2599
02:59:27,080 --> 02:59:32,080
Yeah, it kind of is, except for there's a dude now, so it's two giggling girls and a dude.

2600
02:59:32,080 --> 02:59:33,080
Giggling dude.

2601
02:59:33,080 --> 02:59:35,080
Men ruining everything.

2602
02:59:35,080 --> 02:59:38,080
Where can I get it? Where can I download it? Is it ready?

2603
02:59:38,080 --> 02:59:46,080
It's going to be on EnfamousGamers.com, and that's Enfamous without an I, so N-F-A-M-O-U-S Gamers dot com.

2604
02:59:46,080 --> 02:59:49,080
EnfamousGamers. Sounds good. All right.

2605
02:59:49,080 --> 02:59:56,080
Well, Tiara, thanks so much for your call. Good luck with the podcast since Dark Soccer is on, and I'm sure it'll be a challenge.

2606
02:59:56,080 --> 03:00:02,080
But I'm kidding, I'm kidding. Oh, you should see the death stare. I just got it. It was pretty awesome.

2607
03:00:02,080 --> 03:00:04,080
You owe me ice cream.

2608
03:00:04,080 --> 03:00:09,080
I don't eat ice cream. Good luck. There's your ice cream. All right.

2609
03:00:09,080 --> 03:00:13,080
Tiara, thank you so much for your phone call. Stay black, and we'll talk to you next time.

2610
03:00:13,080 --> 03:00:14,080
All right, thanks.

2611
03:00:14,080 --> 03:00:15,080
All right, take care.

2612
03:00:15,080 --> 03:00:22,080
1-877-KMOLR. Are you seeing him on Skype? It's Orange Lounge Radio.

2613
03:00:22,080 --> 03:00:27,080
I think I'm just going to say that to all the callers tonight. Just, you know, why not?

2614
03:00:27,080 --> 03:00:31,080
All right, 1-877-KMOLR. Your username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2615
03:00:31,080 --> 03:00:34,080
While we wait for some calls, Loki, do we have any last minute stories tonight?

2616
03:00:34,080 --> 03:00:40,080
Snoop Dogg is having some rock band tracks coming to, well, rock band.

2617
03:00:40,080 --> 03:00:41,080
You don't say.

2618
03:00:41,080 --> 03:00:47,080
No, I don't say. No, it's on September 7th. I'm not sure what tracks are actually going to be in the-

2619
03:00:47,080 --> 03:00:50,080
It's not that fucking California girls song, is it?

2620
03:00:50,080 --> 03:01:00,080
It's going to be an eight-pack of tracks. It's going to include, and they don't say. So it's eight tracks, though.

2621
03:01:00,080 --> 03:01:05,080
How convenient. All right, let's go to the phones. We got more calls coming in.

2622
03:01:05,080 --> 03:01:07,080
But they were produced exclusively for rock band.

2623
03:01:07,080 --> 03:01:11,080
Hold on, we're getting hamburger calls. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

2624
03:01:11,080 --> 03:01:17,080
Hello? I think they hung up. Hi, Orange Lounge Radio. You there? Nope, it ended. They hung up.

2625
03:01:17,080 --> 03:01:22,080
Trigger finger, I don't know. Let's go to another call. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

2626
03:01:22,080 --> 03:01:23,080
Hey, this is X-Link.

2627
03:01:23,080 --> 03:01:25,080
Hi, X-Link. How are you, my friend?

2628
03:01:25,080 --> 03:01:32,080
Doing good. Doing well. Watching my fiancé over here playing on my iTouch, the Are You Smart in the 5th Grader.

2629
03:01:32,080 --> 03:01:38,080
Ah, that show. I can't believe they let Jeff Fox wear the host of Game Show.

2630
03:01:38,080 --> 03:01:43,080
But speaking of game shows, The Price is Right on Facebook is a complete crap.

2631
03:01:43,080 --> 03:01:46,080
Really? You are hitting, all right?

2632
03:01:46,080 --> 03:01:48,080
I'm hating it. Why are you hating it?

2633
03:01:48,080 --> 03:01:51,080
It's a completely watered-down version of the PC game.

2634
03:01:51,080 --> 03:01:57,080
If you spend 20 bucks by the PC game, just go through it and you can unlock every single one of these games and play as much as you want.

2635
03:01:57,080 --> 03:02:02,080
Don't sit there spending seven, eight hours trying to unlock every single one of these games, which you can do the same thing for 20 bucks,

2636
03:02:02,080 --> 03:02:06,080
maybe even a little less, and you can find it somewhere on sale or even on eBay or something.

2637
03:02:06,080 --> 03:02:12,080
But will the PC game allow me to post how I'm doing in the game so I can show off my EP into the world?

2638
03:02:12,080 --> 03:02:15,080
Why not just take a screenshot and do the same thing?

2639
03:02:15,080 --> 03:02:23,080
Will it let me possibly, if my team score is high enough, win a trip to L.A. to see a backstage taping or whatever it was called?

2640
03:02:23,080 --> 03:02:25,080
Why would you want to do that when you're already near L.A. as it is?

2641
03:02:25,080 --> 03:02:27,080
I'm not that close.

2642
03:02:27,080 --> 03:02:31,080
Hey, apparently I'm not able to fly there, as I learned this week.

2643
03:02:31,080 --> 03:02:34,080
Yeah, like burning down planes and everything.

2644
03:02:34,080 --> 03:02:37,080
I'm just that awesome, I guess. Burning down the house.

2645
03:02:37,080 --> 03:02:40,080
Yeah. You're hot. You're just burning down planes.

2646
03:02:40,080 --> 03:02:43,080
Hey, hey, hey. You can't make jokes like that.

2647
03:02:43,080 --> 03:02:45,080
Alright. Look, uh...

2648
03:02:45,080 --> 03:02:48,080
We can make jokes like that. They're just not in good taste.

2649
03:02:48,080 --> 03:02:49,080
Clearly.

2650
03:02:49,080 --> 03:02:51,080
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. That's going a little too far.

2651
03:02:51,080 --> 03:02:55,080
Anyways, a lot of these games are on Facebook.

2652
03:02:55,080 --> 03:03:00,080
I just don't like anymore because a lot of them, especially like the Price is Right, how it was in beta,

2653
03:03:00,080 --> 03:03:04,080
I didn't like that because of it being a watered-down version of the PC game.

2654
03:03:04,080 --> 03:03:08,080
Same thing with the iTouch versions of Price is Right.

2655
03:03:08,080 --> 03:03:15,080
And Price is Right were both also watered-down versions of the PC one.

2656
03:03:15,080 --> 03:03:17,080
Some of those iPod games are really horrible.

2657
03:03:17,080 --> 03:03:21,080
And I'll tell you, I finally was able to upgrade to the iPhone 4 this week.

2658
03:03:21,080 --> 03:03:23,080
I didn't talk about it earlier in the show because I had other video games to talk about.

2659
03:03:23,080 --> 03:03:27,080
But I finally, being the sheep I am, I upgraded to an iPhone 4.

2660
03:03:27,080 --> 03:03:33,080
One of the great things about it is that now it has the speed to actually be able to play a lot of the games that are out there for it.

2661
03:03:33,080 --> 03:03:35,080
But some of them aren't worth my time.

2662
03:03:35,080 --> 03:03:39,080
Like, there's a port of Sonic 2 available, which, you know, don't get me wrong.

2663
03:03:39,080 --> 03:03:42,080
I love Sonic and Sega makes some great games.

2664
03:03:42,080 --> 03:03:45,080
But the frame rate, even on the iPhone 4, is kind of junky.

2665
03:03:45,080 --> 03:03:48,080
And just controlling with the touchscreen is kind of crap.

2666
03:03:48,080 --> 03:03:51,080
Like, it just doesn't make for a good experience.

2667
03:03:51,080 --> 03:03:56,080
Not everything in the world has to be on the friggin' iPhone, you know?

2668
03:03:56,080 --> 03:03:58,080
No, I agree.

2669
03:03:58,080 --> 03:04:01,080
You know, I'm a big fan of a lot of different games.

2670
03:04:01,080 --> 03:04:06,080
And a lot of games, when they try to port it over, it was like turning into absolute, you know, crap.

2671
03:04:06,080 --> 03:04:09,080
It's like, what did they do with this? Why did they do this in the first place?

2672
03:04:09,080 --> 03:04:12,080
It's like, you don't think they took enough time with it, you know?

2673
03:04:12,080 --> 03:04:15,080
It's like, or at least enough feedback, I don't know.

2674
03:04:15,080 --> 03:04:19,080
Maybe because a lot of the feedback is being diluted by other companies, but, you know.

2675
03:04:19,080 --> 03:04:22,080
It's really interesting, though, just how saturated the marketplace has become.

2676
03:04:22,080 --> 03:04:26,080
They say it's almost impossible to make money in there now because it's just so, so saturated.

2677
03:04:26,080 --> 03:04:31,080
It takes so much for your game to stick out amongst everything that's out there

2678
03:04:31,080 --> 03:04:33,080
that a lot of people are really struggling.

2679
03:04:33,080 --> 03:04:35,080
I totally agree. I totally agree.

2680
03:04:35,080 --> 03:04:39,080
And, you know, I mean, nothing against any of these games.

2681
03:04:39,080 --> 03:04:41,080
You know, I love Price is Right and I love that kind of stuff.

2682
03:04:41,080 --> 03:04:43,080
And the only reason why I didn't blast it out at everybody on my Facebook page

2683
03:04:43,080 --> 03:04:46,080
is because I didn't really want everybody to be playing it.

2684
03:04:46,080 --> 03:04:48,080
I looked at it and I'm like, at first, it wasn't even loading.

2685
03:04:48,080 --> 03:04:51,080
It wasn't even loading at first. It was coming up as a blink train.

2686
03:04:51,080 --> 03:04:55,080
And when they did it, it was like, when I saw it, I'm like, no, I'm not doing this.

2687
03:04:55,080 --> 03:05:00,080
To be fair, to play Devil's Advocate just a little bit, the game is still in beta,

2688
03:05:00,080 --> 03:05:03,080
so it's not going to be perfect. I just got to throw that out there.

2689
03:05:03,080 --> 03:05:09,080
Yes, but I had 20, you know, I'd rather pay my $20 PC game that I bought.

2690
03:05:09,080 --> 03:05:11,080
So I was happy when I bought it day one.

2691
03:05:11,080 --> 03:05:15,080
I guess one point you do make, you know, you only get to play so many games

2692
03:05:15,080 --> 03:05:18,080
of The Price is Right for free, and then if you want more coins,

2693
03:05:18,080 --> 03:05:20,080
you have to buy them with real money.

2694
03:05:20,080 --> 03:05:24,080
So I totally get your point. Don't spend real money on this game

2695
03:05:24,080 --> 03:05:27,080
if you could just plop down $20 and get a superior game.

2696
03:05:27,080 --> 03:05:28,080
I'll agree with that.

2697
03:05:28,080 --> 03:05:30,080
Or even cheaper, depending on where you buy it from.

2698
03:05:30,080 --> 03:05:33,080
I mean, I've seen it even on sale as low as $10, depending on what place it's from.

2699
03:05:33,080 --> 03:05:38,080
So I mean, yes. Like I said before, it's worth the wait.

2700
03:05:38,080 --> 03:05:40,080
And the games are really good.

2701
03:05:40,080 --> 03:05:42,080
I mean, they did a real good job with Press Your Luck.

2702
03:05:42,080 --> 03:05:44,080
I love it for the PC. I play it all the time.

2703
03:05:44,080 --> 03:05:46,080
I love how there's 17 different episodes you can go through

2704
03:05:46,080 --> 03:05:48,080
and unlock different stuff.

2705
03:05:48,080 --> 03:05:53,080
But as for the other versions, other than maybe that and the Wii, it was crap.

2706
03:05:53,080 --> 03:05:57,080
It was like they just threw it out there without even knowing what was going on.

2707
03:05:57,080 --> 03:06:01,080
And I would love to see the PlayStation version have, like, avatar support.

2708
03:06:01,080 --> 03:06:04,080
But unfortunately, like I said before, the reason it didn't

2709
03:06:04,080 --> 03:06:09,080
is because of the fact that it was a bad replica of the port,

2710
03:06:09,080 --> 03:06:12,080
basically from that of the PC or the Wii.

2711
03:06:12,080 --> 03:06:15,080
All right. Well, I got to wrap up here.

2712
03:06:15,080 --> 03:06:18,080
Anything else you want to talk to our listeners about tonight real quick?

2713
03:06:18,080 --> 03:06:20,080
No, that's pretty much it. That's all I wanted to say.

2714
03:06:20,080 --> 03:06:23,080
That and the fact that Civ IV demo won't be coming out to the day of.

2715
03:06:23,080 --> 03:06:26,080
Civ V, but yes, it's not coming out to the day of.

2716
03:06:26,080 --> 03:06:29,080
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I've been so behind you.

2717
03:06:29,080 --> 03:06:32,080
There's too many damn games to keep track of these days. It's all right.

2718
03:06:32,080 --> 03:06:34,080
Well, thank you for the call, my friend. Really appreciate it.

2719
03:06:34,080 --> 03:06:37,080
Have a wonderful week, and stay black.

2720
03:06:37,080 --> 03:06:38,080
You too. 5,000.

2721
03:06:38,080 --> 03:06:39,080
Bye.

2722
03:06:39,080 --> 03:06:41,080
What'd he say at the end there?

2723
03:06:41,080 --> 03:06:42,080
I missed that.

2724
03:06:42,080 --> 03:06:45,080
I missed it too. I hope it wasn't another plain joke,

2725
03:06:45,080 --> 03:06:47,080
because, yeah, they frown on those.

2726
03:06:47,080 --> 03:06:49,080
All right, that's it for the Skype line tonight.

2727
03:06:49,080 --> 03:06:51,080
Thank you guys so much for calling. We appreciate it.

2728
03:06:51,080 --> 03:06:54,080
Sorry if you didn't get through, but please, you can always send us an email, a tweet.

2729
03:06:54,080 --> 03:06:57,080
It's not too much to ask. 140 characters or less.

2730
03:06:57,080 --> 03:07:00,080
Loki, any stories you want to get out here before we finish?

2731
03:07:00,080 --> 03:07:05,080
Uh, yeah, I was just checking that right now to see if there was anything we didn't talk about.

2732
03:07:05,080 --> 03:07:08,080
You know what? Tigerclaw's throwing one out in chat I'll mention real quick.

2733
03:07:08,080 --> 03:07:12,080
I don't remember hearing this either unless Matt had just covered it before in the last one.

2734
03:07:12,080 --> 03:07:15,080
There's an Epic Mickey Collector's Edition. Did you mention that?

2735
03:07:15,080 --> 03:07:17,080
No, I didn't mention that, but whatever.

2736
03:07:17,080 --> 03:07:22,080
There is this Epic Mickey Collector's Edition, which you don't see a whole lot of Wii game collector's editions,

2737
03:07:22,080 --> 03:07:26,080
so that's kind of cool. But yeah, it looks like it's in an extra big box,

2738
03:07:26,080 --> 03:07:29,080
and it comes with a little, uh, it's $69.99.

2739
03:07:29,080 --> 03:07:33,080
It comes with a faceplate for the Wiimote, a DVD as well,

2740
03:07:33,080 --> 03:07:38,080
and it looks like a little five-inch vinyl figurine of Mickey with a paintbrush, which is kind of cool.

2741
03:07:38,080 --> 03:07:42,080
They had also a new collector's edition for Dead Rising 2,

2742
03:07:42,080 --> 03:07:44,080
where you can actually get it from Capcom,

2743
03:07:44,080 --> 03:07:48,080
and it comes with, like, a bunch of poker chips and custom poker cards and stuff like that,

2744
03:07:48,080 --> 03:07:54,080
and then also a chance to win a six-foot-tall life-size statue of, uh, Zombie.

2745
03:07:54,080 --> 03:07:56,080
But that's only, you know.

2746
03:07:56,080 --> 03:08:01,080
I thought at first, before I actually read the article, that it was every single package that was like,

2747
03:08:01,080 --> 03:08:06,080
oop, gonna buy that instantly, but, uh, obviously that would be way too expensive.

2748
03:08:06,080 --> 03:08:09,080
But, um, that's something that they're gonna be giving away.

2749
03:08:09,080 --> 03:08:15,080
Uh, let's see, stuff that maybe we didn't talk about.

2750
03:08:15,080 --> 03:08:18,080
Um...

2751
03:08:18,080 --> 03:08:19,080
Ah, yes.

2752
03:08:19,080 --> 03:08:23,080
Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep is not coming to the PlayStation Network,

2753
03:08:23,080 --> 03:08:27,080
so if you own a PSP Go, you ain't playing that game.

2754
03:08:27,080 --> 03:08:29,080
Thank you, Square Enix.

2755
03:08:29,080 --> 03:08:31,080
Um...

2756
03:08:31,080 --> 03:08:34,080
See, we talked a little bit about Angry Birds.

2757
03:08:34,080 --> 03:08:39,080
Um, I guess the devs working with Hollywood advisors on a possible movie pitch.

2758
03:08:39,080 --> 03:08:42,080
They will probably accept it because they're desperate for stuff.

2759
03:08:42,080 --> 03:08:44,080
Um...

2760
03:08:44,080 --> 03:08:48,080
The full track list for DJ Hero 2 got released.

2761
03:08:48,080 --> 03:08:52,080
Well, by track list, it means the songs that they will be using in the mixes.

2762
03:08:52,080 --> 03:08:54,080
Um, some cool stuff, though, I actually like.

2763
03:08:54,080 --> 03:08:58,080
It was funny, one of the songs I was actually almost gonna pick for a cage mechanism,

2764
03:08:58,080 --> 03:09:03,080
and still might pick, uh, the Prodigy Omen off their new album is on there.

2765
03:09:03,080 --> 03:09:08,080
And of course the, um, the classic Firestarter is part of that as well.

2766
03:09:08,080 --> 03:09:11,080
Um, some new Tiesto tracks on there.

2767
03:09:11,080 --> 03:09:16,080
Uh, Speedrail, I Will Be Here, and Come On.

2768
03:09:16,080 --> 03:09:20,080
Um, lots of Lady Gaga, actually.

2769
03:09:20,080 --> 03:09:25,080
They're gonna have Love Game, Bad Romance, and Just Dance in there as well.

2770
03:09:25,080 --> 03:09:29,080
Of course, Connie West's Love Lockdown and Heartless.

2771
03:09:29,080 --> 03:09:34,080
Um, and then they've got some random, like, old school stuff in there.

2772
03:09:34,080 --> 03:09:37,080
Like, they have, uh...

2773
03:09:37,080 --> 03:09:39,080
Is it Janet Jackson with Nasty?

2774
03:09:39,080 --> 03:09:45,080
Um, you know, they have Axl F is in there, the Axl Fully theme from the Beverly Hills Cop movies.

2775
03:09:45,080 --> 03:09:49,080
Um, Gorillaz, they've got Stylo in there.

2776
03:09:49,080 --> 03:09:51,080
Sweet!

2777
03:09:51,080 --> 03:09:54,080
Uh, Donna Summer's with, uh, Bad Girls.

2778
03:09:54,080 --> 03:09:58,080
Stylo has a pretty sweet bass line, though, I bet mixes really well with other songs.

2779
03:09:58,080 --> 03:10:01,080
Uh, New Order's Blue Monday is gonna be in there.

2780
03:10:01,080 --> 03:10:03,080
Uh, Orbital with the box.

2781
03:10:03,080 --> 03:10:05,080
That's pretty awesome, they have Orbital in there.

2782
03:10:05,080 --> 03:10:07,080
Uh, Salt-N-Pepa's Push It.

2783
03:10:07,080 --> 03:10:09,080
And then, um...

2784
03:10:09,080 --> 03:10:15,080
It's kinda cool, uh, Justice is gonna be in there as well with D.A.N.C.E. and also Waters of Nazareth.

2785
03:10:15,080 --> 03:10:21,080
I don't remember Waters of Nazareth, but I did put in D.A.N.C.E. in that cage match, so that's kinda cool.

2786
03:10:21,080 --> 03:10:22,080
But yeah, lots of cool stuff.

2787
03:10:22,080 --> 03:10:25,080
Uh, only one Daft Punk song, so that's a little depressing.

2788
03:10:25,080 --> 03:10:27,080
Human, after all, is in there.

2789
03:10:27,080 --> 03:10:30,080
Um, Basement Jacks with Where's Your Head At.

2790
03:10:30,080 --> 03:10:32,080
Um, yeah, lots of cool stuff.

2791
03:10:32,080 --> 03:10:34,080
Very excited about it.

2792
03:10:34,080 --> 03:10:39,080
In fact, actually, they have a Facebook app that you can check out that's a contest where you're supposed to guess what the mashups are.

2793
03:10:39,080 --> 03:10:45,080
And they're kinda giving you a little bit of a preview of, um, some of the songs that are actually gonna be in the game of sets and stuff.

2794
03:10:45,080 --> 03:10:47,080
So, it's kinda neat, so check that out.

2795
03:10:47,080 --> 03:10:52,080
Alright. I wonder if there's any standalone songs, cause there were a few of those in, uh, D0-1, like Herbie Hancock.

2796
03:10:52,080 --> 03:10:57,080
There might be some beat juggles or whatever, um, so, that could be cool.

2797
03:10:57,080 --> 03:11:00,080
Um, I don't know.

2798
03:11:00,080 --> 03:11:02,080
Uh, we'll see.

2799
03:11:02,080 --> 03:11:03,080
Yeah.

2800
03:11:03,080 --> 03:11:09,080
Alright, well if that's it for, uh, Last Minute Stories, then, um, I guess it's time to go around and get everybody's final thought.

2801
03:11:09,080 --> 03:11:11,080
It's time to end another show.

2802
03:11:11,080 --> 03:11:12,080
Boohoo, sad.

2803
03:11:12,080 --> 03:11:14,080
Um, final thoughts tonight.

2804
03:11:14,080 --> 03:11:16,080
Darsakra, what's your final thought tonight?

2805
03:11:16,080 --> 03:11:17,080
My arms hurt.

2806
03:11:17,080 --> 03:11:18,080
I'm sorry to hear that.

2807
03:11:18,080 --> 03:11:20,080
Loki, you have a final thought tonight?

2808
03:11:20,080 --> 03:11:27,080
Uh, one last thing I was gonna say, uh, Portal is also gonna become part of the syllabus at apparently Wabush College.

2809
03:11:27,080 --> 03:11:31,080
It's actually, you know, I don't think you have to read it, but obviously play it.

2810
03:11:31,080 --> 03:11:33,080
Cause they're a heck of a final thought.

2811
03:11:33,080 --> 03:11:40,080
Yeah, but, uh, no, my final thought is, uh, I have a headache from lack of sleep, and I don't anticipate it going away.

2812
03:11:40,080 --> 03:11:42,080
And that sucks.

2813
03:11:42,080 --> 03:11:47,080
My final thought is, back to work tomorrow, back to the real world, boohoo, cry, sob.

2814
03:11:47,080 --> 03:11:50,080
But hey, three day weekend coming up, yay! Labor Day!

2815
03:11:50,080 --> 03:11:52,080
Yay!

2816
03:11:52,080 --> 03:11:54,080
That's right, that's, uh, next weekend.

2817
03:11:54,080 --> 03:11:56,080
That's right, it's coming weekend.

2818
03:11:56,080 --> 03:11:58,080
Ah, that's why we're doing the, it all makes sense now.

2819
03:11:58,080 --> 03:12:01,080
There you go! Hello!

2820
03:12:01,080 --> 03:12:03,080
Uh, you know what that means, though?

2821
03:12:03,080 --> 03:12:08,080
That means I have to wake up earlier with the baby, because Nellie's gonna be like, I wanna sleep in!

2822
03:12:08,080 --> 03:12:10,080
Which is fine, you know, I let her.

2823
03:12:10,080 --> 03:12:19,080
I pamper this woman, like, seriously, I get like four hours of sleep, and I give her a foot massage.

2824
03:12:19,080 --> 03:12:24,080
You know, I don't even go to sleep, I give her a foot massage, and then I go to sleep.

2825
03:12:24,080 --> 03:12:25,080
Wow.

2826
03:12:25,080 --> 03:12:27,080
Yeah, yeah, good husband here!

2827
03:12:27,080 --> 03:12:28,080
You're a great husband.

2828
03:12:28,080 --> 03:12:35,080
Alright, uh, keep your eye out on the forums, guys, we're gonna be taking suggestions for the marathon, um, within reason, keep it clean.

2829
03:12:35,080 --> 03:12:40,080
Uh, and, uh, all that good stuff, um, Loki, of course, will be joining us next week for the real show, quote, quote.

2830
03:12:40,080 --> 03:12:47,080
Uh, and then, uh, myself, DarkSakura, Alan will be here for the marathon, um, hopefully Dan, and who knows who else are gonna show up.

2831
03:12:47,080 --> 03:12:51,080
You gotta invite Mystique, I hope she shows up, because she can yell random things in the microphone.

2832
03:12:51,080 --> 03:12:53,080
What other local folks can we be inviting to the show?

2833
03:12:53,080 --> 03:12:55,080
Maybe a few peeps.

2834
03:12:55,080 --> 03:12:57,080
Alright, it'll be surprise-filled.

2835
03:12:57,080 --> 03:13:00,080
So, we'll be back next week with an epic, epicness show.

2836
03:13:00,080 --> 03:13:03,080
Uh, until then, thank you guys so much for listening to our show.

2837
03:13:03,080 --> 03:13:07,080
If you like what you've heard, as we always say, please tell a friend or two about the show.

2838
03:13:07,080 --> 03:13:09,080
Help us spread the word about Orange Lounge Radio.

2839
03:13:09,080 --> 03:13:13,080
We don't have a huge website backing us, you know, we're not a one-up or a game spot or whatever.

2840
03:13:13,080 --> 03:13:16,080
We are just us, and we always have been, and we're not gonna change.

2841
03:13:16,080 --> 03:13:19,080
Um, so we'll see you next week with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

2842
03:13:19,080 --> 03:13:21,080
Have a great week, everybody!

2843
03:13:21,080 --> 03:13:22,080
And stay black.

03:13:22,080 --> 03:13:26,080
