7000	12000	With your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky, and Lowkey
13000	21000	Tonight, August 8th, 2010, Kinect may not be available for Indie games. Soon you can play video games with your eyes.
21000	24000	And a warning for all Starcraft 2 players.
24000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	37000	Hello my friends and welcome to episode number 377 of Orange Lounge Radio.
37000	41000	We are that video game talk show where every gamer has a voice.
41000	48000	My name is Rob Roberts. I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host, the one and only, knocking stuff over.
48000	51000	She reaches for her mic. Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
51000	56000	How you doing? Why are you so angry? Why are you mad though?
56000	63000	Because I made a boo boo and this thing is trying to get rid of this stupid thing.
63000	66000	You made a boo boo? Please, let's revel in what mistakes you've made.
68000	74000	I got that security shield thing because I hit space.
75000	79000	So my security shield, is that one of those spammy spam spammers programs?
79000	85000	It's called a rogue anti-spyware when it's really the worst kind of spyware there is.
85000	91000	So it's spyware disguised as anti-spyware. It's the type of thing my mom would have all over her computer.
91000	94000	Yeah, and I'm trying to get rid of it without having to reboot.
94000	99000	So word of warning to those folks out there. Watch what you hit the space bar on.
99000	101000	I know right. Just because it looks like your windows doesn't mean it's right.
101000	107000	And I was actually right in the middle of typing to somebody on AIM when it popped up.
107000	110000	I hate that. Because I use the space bar for everything.
110000	115000	Right, of course. Alright, not joining us tonight is Tech Master Loki.
115000	118000	Of course, if you were listening to last week's show, he had a baby last week.
118000	122000	So he's on baby leave for a little while. We'll let you know when he's going to come back.
122000	126000	But filling in for Loki in the meantime, not replacing Loki because Loki is irreplaceable.
126000	132000	But filling in for Loki, say hello to, we've missed this guy too because it's been a while since he's been on the show.
132000	135000	Say hello to Dan the Man. How you doing Dan?
135000	138000	I'm kind of on the show like every week or two.
138000	142000	Well you do drop in and say hello, but you don't sit in on the show like you're doing tonight.
142000	144000	I get to sit at my own desk.
144000	146000	I know, instead of Loki taking up the chair, it's you.
146000	147000	Awesome.
147000	151000	So the listeners heard you had a rough week last week. How you doing though?
151000	152000	Not really.
152000	153000	Yeah?
153000	154000	I feel like before.
154000	156000	I'm sorry, not this last week.
156000	157000	It was last week.
157000	158000	Whatever.
158000	159000	I'm good.
159000	160000	You're good. Feeling good?
160000	161000	Yeah.
161000	164000	Alright. Are you feeling beautiful?
164000	165000	Of course.
165000	167000	I just had to throw him a curve ball.
167000	168000	And awesome.
168000	173000	Alright. Dan is going to be helping out while Loki's on vacation because it's really easy for Dan to help out because he lives here.
173000	176000	So, you know, he's usually pretty readily available.
176000	182000	So Dan will be filling in until Loki decides he's going to come back, which I hope he does decide to come back at some point.
182000	185000	Because I got to admit, there's that part of me that's always wondered.
185000	190000	You know, when Loki has this baby, is he going to want to do a little radio show on the internet anymore?
190000	195000	Or is he going to worry that the stuff he says on this show his kid might hear someday? I don't know.
195000	197000	That would be awfully pathetic.
197000	202000	No, I'm positive he will come back, but he can take all the time he needs.
202000	205000	Alright. Well, we'll get back to Dan in a little while.
205000	210000	But I want to introduce somebody else to you guys because we have a guest in the studio tonight too.
210000	212000	And we're really glad to have her.
212000	219000	It's the second time she's been on the show and she probably would be one of the few guests that come.
219000	225000	I can only think of maybe two or three guests that have traveled further than she has to be on the show.
225000	227000	Say hello, everybody, to Misty is here tonight.
227000	229000	Howdy, y'all.
229000	230000	How you doing, Misty?
230000	231000	I'm doing good.
231000	232000	Alright, excellent.
232000	235000	So, let's see, for those that haven't, when was the last time you were on the show?
235000	237000	It was about a year ago-ish?
237000	242000	No, due to stuff happening last time, we never even got to do a pre-taped segment.
242000	246000	So this is my first time, just my second time being in Dan and Jamie's house.
246000	250000	I thought for some reason you were on a show. Oh, we did like a pre-taped thing or something, huh?
250000	252000	We didn't even get to that last time.
252000	253000	Really?
253000	254000	Really.
254000	255000	I thought you should have been on a show before.
255000	256000	Yeah, Rob.
256000	257000	Yeah.
257000	262000	Well, okay, after 377 episodes, they all start to blur a little bit, okay? Give me a break.
262000	265000	Alright, well anyway, then welcome to the show at BSMA.
265000	268000	But you've called in before and all that good stuff, so hopefully the listeners know you.
268000	274000	And also, a lot of listeners may have not heard you because you don't call in every week.
274000	280000	But you have a presence on the website, and you've been following the Twitters, and I know you've always been a big supporter of the show.
280000	284000	So thank you, first off, for being such a supporter of OLR over the years.
284000	286000	When did you first start listening? It's been a while, right?
286000	287000	Episode 91.
287000	290000	Wow, that's some time ago. Alright.
290000	296000	What is the best thing about Orange Lounge Radio, you think? Just to inflate our egos a little bit?
296000	306000	Again, it's back more toward the DDR in random days. Of course, the tangents that pop up now still make it worth it.
306000	318000	You know, I've kind of heard that, that even though we're not a music-based game show anymore, kind of like the community that still lives on because of that, I've definitely heard is like a thing that people like about the show.
318000	328000	And certainly, you know, as much as I've hated on a lot of the recent games that that same company's put out that gave us DDR, obviously the show wouldn't exist if it weren't for that.
328000	336000	And for that, I will always be thankful, and they'll always be a part of me that wants to play those games as crappy as they are these days.
336000	340000	Alright, anyhow, so Misty will be joining us, and we'll talk to her a little more a little later.
340000	346000	But we're going to get into a little bit of how was your gaming week, because we always start off the show talking about our gaming weeks and what we've been playing.
346000	353000	So let's go over to DarkSakura. What have you been playing besides Download, Add-A-Wear, and Spybot as quickly as possible?
353000	366000	Well, I played some Ragnarok and Star Trek online, as usual, and then I made Dan play stuff for me so I could watch, because my hand still hurts a lot.
366000	368000	Oh, that's right. You still have the hand thing going on.
368000	370000	But it's not seeping joint fluid anymore.
370000	374000	Yeah, actually, I can stand to look at it now. I get very squeamish with the whole blood thing.
374000	375000	You can touch it.
375000	379000	I don't want to touch it. I don't want to touch it. Why?
379000	382000	Because it's not gross.
382000	384000	I meant to slide the hole, not the hole.
384000	385000	Oh, I touched the hole.
385000	386000	Rob touched the hole.
386000	388000	I touched Jamie's hole. Sorry, Dan.
388000	390000	Alright.
390000	392000	No problem.
392000	393000	Alright.
393000	396000	Oh, Rob.
396000	401000	At least the hole's in your hand and not in your head.
401000	405000	But Dan played the games for me so that I could watch and then go, what?
405000	409000	Alright. Well, Dan, we'll skip on over to you. What kind of games have you been playing this week?
409000	413000	I've been playing Hydra Thunder Hurricane, which is awesome.
413000	418000	Why is it awesome? Because I downloaded it and I was like, this just isn't the same.
418000	423000	Because I love jet boat racing. I don't understand why, but it's awesome.
423000	431000	I can, like, jump my boat, break things, win races, go online, get my ass kicked. It's amazing.
431000	436000	Why is it that everybody online is better than me? Like, I can't figure this out.
436000	438000	Like, it doesn't matter what game I play.
438000	444000	And is it just me, guys? Whenever I go online and play a game online, I am always in last place.
444000	449000	Unless it's not.
449000	455000	See, she didn't have a mic. Room spontaneously combusts into laughter in a while.
455000	457000	That's the way Mystique works.
457000	462000	Yeah, she's Mystique. Stop it. We're doing a radio show.
462000	464000	She doesn't care.
464000	469000	Dan and Jamie's friend, Mystique, she's funny and she ran in here and just whispered,
469000	472000	you know, I said, why do I always come in last? She just came in here and whispered,
472000	476000	it's because you're gay. And that's why everybody started laughing.
476000	480000	Because she came in here and gave the thumbs up. So anyway, we got to get her mic.
480000	484000	We got to get a wireless mic for Mystique so that way when she runs in and out, we'll still get her.
484000	487000	Anyway, where was I? See, now I got lost.
487000	491000	Thanks Mystique for derailing the whole goddamn show.
491000	492000	We're talking about my gaming week.
492000	493000	Oh, yes.
493000	495000	We decided to lament the fact that you suck at games online.
495000	499000	Yes, I suck at video games online. Why is it Halo? Last place.
499000	504000	I would think partially because the only game I'll typically play online is Rock Band 2.
504000	508000	I do okay with the music games. DDR, like UltraMix back in the day.
508000	510000	I would kick your ass at UltraMix. I will.
510000	513000	But there were some very scary people that could even beat me.
513000	515000	But that's one of the few.
515000	518000	But like, okay, Blur. Have you played Blur? The online racing game?
518000	520000	Have you played it online at all against other people?
520000	521000	No.
521000	527000	Usually I do really shitty, but one time, one time I actually won a race.
527000	531000	I won a race against like 10 other people and I was so excited.
531000	533000	I'll admit, I felt a little tingle down there.
533000	536000	I was so excited.
536000	537000	Wow.
537000	539000	And that's like the only time that's ever happened.
539000	541000	Alright.
541000	543000	And that new downloadable Castlevania.
543000	545000	How is the new downloadable Castlevania?
545000	549000	Well, I only played the trial, so it's interesting.
549000	556000	It seems like it'd probably be really cool with a crew of people, but by yourself, not very fun.
556000	560000	I've heard it's an awesome multiplayer game, but I have yet to experience the multiplayer.
560000	562000	Did you download it?
562000	567000	I checked out the demo for a little bit and I played it at E3 a few months ago.
567000	572000	And when I was at E3, I was like, this game's kind of weird, but it's kind of interesting and fun.
572000	575000	And when I downloaded it, I was like, yeah, this is still kind of weird.
575000	579000	The thing I don't like about the game, and I don't like games that do this,
579000	585000	is that the game really just throws you in with no description whatsoever.
585000	590000	And look, guys, I realize most Atari 2600 games and NES games back in the day did the same thing.
590000	593000	Like Mario doesn't tell you what to do.
593000	596000	But games were less complicated back then.
596000	598000	It takes a second.
598000	600000	And there's so many buttons and stuff.
600000	605000	Usually I need a little bit of a tutorial, but all I see in Castlevania is boss.
605000	609000	And I'm like, okay, I'll go do that.
609000	613000	But then every time I think I know the way to the boss, there's a fucking wall there or something.
613000	616000	I'm like, why didn't I see that when I was looking at the whole map?
616000	620000	It seems to be my new four people who are going to download it, it'd be worth my money.
620000	622000	But is it 15?
622000	625000	It is 15. That's where it's at now.
625000	627000	If it was 10 bucks, it'd be almost an automatic anyway.
627000	632000	The $15 thing, except for a game like Hurricane, which is obviously an undertaking,
632000	636000	it seems to me like that's a little excessive for Castlevania.
636000	639000	All right, I'm going to go to the chat room, because chat rooms are filling up with comments here.
639000	641000	chat.orangelandsradio.com
641000	644000	We love our chatters, and every week they join us here.
644000	648000	Let's see, TigerClaw is going to start us off tonight saying, in response to the
648000	650000	Why Do I Always Lose Online,
650000	653000	Sky, it's simple, they've been playing the game a whole lot.
653000	656000	If you're someone who plays casual, you'll get your ass kicked online.
656000	658000	Yeah, pretty much.
658000	661000	He also goes on to say, I haven't played Starcraft 2 online yet,
661000	663000	knowing I'll just get my ass whooped.
663000	666000	I want to play it online, but only doing co-op games.
666000	668000	That's kind of how I feel about a lot of that stuff, too.
668000	673000	But yet, I play World of Warcraft, and I actually really enjoy PVP and World of Warcraft.
673000	677000	But that's, World of Warcraft's not like other games.
677000	681000	It's really not. Games like that, their MMOs are in a little bubble of their own.
681000	683000	They're not like other stuff.
683000	687000	Leo Shannon in our chat says, Rob, try BlazBlue, whatever you want to say, CS.
687000	690000	They have a beginner mode that works with online mode.
690000	693000	You can button mash your way to victory.
693000	695000	Sounds good to me. There you go.
695000	701000	And Amaze Satsuma chimes in and says,
701000	704000	New Castlevania does have a good multiplayer game.
704000	707000	There you go.
707000	710000	Hello? Hi.
710000	712000	And now your mic is ruined again.
712000	714000	How about this?
714000	718000	I was explaining to Dan why we can't have more than three people in the chat room.
718000	721000	Because the moment number four pops in, boot.
721000	723000	Is Misty on 3G, though? Are you on 3G?
723000	724000	No, I'm on Wi-Fi.
724000	726000	Can you switch to 3G or will your app stop working?
726000	730000	It's all Wi-Fi for mine. Remember, I have no fancy iPhone.
730000	732000	Oh, that's right. You have an iPhone.
732000	734000	It looks like an iPhone.
734000	736000	That's right. I'll live.
736000	738000	Dan, you can look over here.
738000	740000	It's always there.
740000	743000	Anyway, chat.orangeonshade.com if you want to chat with the host.
743000	745000	Except for Dan, because he can't get in.
745000	747000	Screw you people.
747000	749000	You have a mic. Why do you need IRC?
749000	751000	So I can see what people are saying.
751000	753000	He wants to know when people are talking shit about him.
753000	756000	If people are talking shit, I'll let you know.
756000	757000	Holy crap.
757000	758000	You okay there?
758000	760000	Oh, I was running Hijack This to see if I could find it,
760000	762000	but there's way too many things that are running.
762000	764000	Jamie's computer is super broken.
764000	767000	Jamie has downloaded like seven anti-spyware programs
767000	769000	since the time I sat down in this chair.
769000	772000	I just downloaded Hijack This and Attawear, but haven't rebooted.
772000	775000	She doesn't just want to remove the spyware from her computer.
775000	777000	She wants to obliterate it.
777000	779000	She wants to wipe it off the base of the planet.
779000	780000	You will die.
780000	783000	I've already deleted a whole bunch of its DLLs
783000	785000	and stopped the process from running.
785000	788000	Because Jamie steals so much crap off the internet.
788000	791000	Jamie's going to show up at the front door of the company
791000	794000	that made this with her iron fists.
794000	796000	Somebody's going to get face pummeled.
796000	798000	I want her not to go to the porn websites.
798000	800000	But no!
800000	804000	For the record, I was going to a site that explained
804000	807000	the history of gay people in the Old Testament.
807000	809000	Porn!
809000	810000	Okay.
810000	812000	I don't know why you're giving her shit about it, Dan.
812000	813000	You made her download it.
813000	817000	I wanted to read the article and instead it did this shit to me.
817000	820000	I was trying to be conscientious!
820000	822000	I get my porn from other websites.
822000	824000	I get my porn from kicking you.
824000	828000	Alright, anything else that you played this week, Dan?
828000	830000	I played a bunch of Genesis games
830000	832000	because my wife was like, play Genesis games!
832000	834000	Yeah, I heard there was Sega Night last night.
834000	836000	Yeah, I don't know.
836000	838000	All I know is Jamie wanted me to get beat
838000	840000	because she picked every one of the hardest Genesis games
840000	842000	and was like, play this, play this.
842000	844000	Finally she goes back for another batch of games
844000	846000	and I'm like, if she comes back with Gunstar Heroes
846000	847000	I'm going to shoot her.
847000	850000	And she came back with Gunstar Heroes.
850000	853000	What was the other game that I brought?
853000	856000	I don't remember what the other one was.
856000	858000	Oh, no, it wasn't Midnight Resistance.
858000	861000	It was something else difficult.
861000	863000	But the games that I brought out were...
863000	865000	Well, it was Robo-Lest and Silpheed.
865000	867000	Every freaking game, yeah.
867000	870000	Silpheed, Robo-Lest, Shattered Answer,
870000	872000	Strider, which is normally a game that I would just
872000	874000	dominate without even thinking about it.
874000	877000	And tonight, or last night, every cheap death
877000	879000	I was like, son of a bitch!
879000	881000	Oh, terrible stuff.
881000	883000	Didn't you beat Strider with your eyes closed once
883000	885000	or something crazy? What was it?
885000	887000	I've beaten Strider every which way.
887000	889000	Seriously.
889000	892000	And last night, like I said, I continued three times,
892000	894000	didn't finish the game.
894000	896000	I was just like, all right.
896000	898000	That's plenty of that.
898000	900000	For the record, it was two stages.
900000	902000	Genesis does what I don't.
902000	904000	For the record, it was two stages that I beat
904000	906000	with my eyes closed.
906000	908000	I have no idea what you're talking about.
908000	910000	When I was a kid, I could beat 8-1
910000	912000	on Super Mario Brothers with my eyes closed
912000	915000	because I had the level timed.
915000	919000	I could get through 8-1 without stopping,
919000	921000	but I couldn't do it with my eyes closed.
921000	923000	But I could do it continuously running through the whole thing.
923000	925000	I couldn't do that anymore.
925000	927000	I can still get through it running.
927000	929000	I couldn't do it blindfolded anymore
929000	931000	because I don't remember the timing.
931000	933000	All right.
933000	935000	I want to know what crazy accomplishments
935000	937000	our chatters have accomplished in video games.
937000	939000	Like, just weird shit.
939000	941000	Like, you beat a game. Okay, great.
941000	943000	Yeah, we all beat games.
943000	945000	I want to know, like, you beat a game
945000	947000	while hanging upside down,
947000	949000	getting water shot at your face or something.
949000	951000	I want to know what crazy video game accomplishments
951000	953000	you guys have done.
953000	955000	That would be fun to know about.
955000	957000	It was kind of nonexistent.
957000	959000	I think I pretty much hit on everything I played this week.
959000	961000	I had a really busy week,
961000	963000	so I didn't get a lot done,
963000	965000	and I really didn't get a lot done with the podcast,
965000	967000	so I apologize to that. I'll talk about that in a minute.
967000	969000	But I didn't play a lot outside of Warcraft.
969000	971000	I'll give you guys a Warcraft update
971000	973000	for those that care, all two of you.
973000	975000	Shut up.
975000	977000	Our guild is now in Icecrown Citadel
977000	979000	because remember, our guild is about six months
979000	981000	behind all the other guilds
981000	983000	because we didn't start raiding
983000	985000	about six weeks ago, probably, at this point.
985000	987000	We're now in Icecrown Citadel.
987000	989000	You were raiding, but it wasn't lairs.
989000	991000	We're in Icecrown Citadel now,
991000	993000	and we took out the fourth boss, Sauerfang.
993000	995000	And that's how far we are right now.
995000	997000	Sauerfang.
997000	999000	Oh, I was like, if it's Sauerfang?
999000	1001000	That guy had to be like...
1001000	1003000	It's with you, it's not an O.
1003000	1005000	But I was saying, if it was Sauer,
1005000	1007000	then I'd be like, okay, what's gonna be my
1007000	1009000	fear-instilling nickname?
1009000	1011000	Well, he got Bloodfang,
1011000	1013000	Evilfang, and this one's Darkfang.
1013000	1015000	I guess I'll go with Sauer.
1015000	1017000	Sauerfang.
1017000	1019000	It's not like Sauerfang, it's Sauerfang.
1019000	1021000	Sauerfang. That sounds like a dog.
1021000	1023000	Sauerfang.
1023000	1025000	So yeah, that was the ICC accomplishment.
1025000	1027000	I am on number four, by the way.
1027000	1029000	Number four.
1029000	1031000	Removal program number four.
1031000	1033000	The AVG is good.
1033000	1035000	It's all the stuff that I should have put on here to begin with.
1035000	1037000	So you know what the problem with this whole thing is?
1037000	1039000	I'm gonna have to fix your computer.
1039000	1041000	I fixed your computer
1041000	1043000	when you had that stupid thing that kept popping up.
1043000	1045000	You remember that one registry thing that would keep
1045000	1047000	replicating itself every time you deleted the
1047000	1049000	registry file unless you removed yourself
1049000	1051000	from the internet? No, because I really try not to
1051000	1053000	get that shit on my computer.
1053000	1055000	Everybody got it. And I removed it off Dan's.
1055000	1057000	I have no idea what you're talking about.
1057000	1059000	I just had a video card explode on me once.
1059000	1061000	That was really... I don't get a lot of spot...
1061000	1063000	Well, my WoW account got hacked
1063000	1065000	about... when was it? It was when I was in Disneyland
1065000	1067000	October, so it was about
1067000	1069000	almost a year ago now.
1069000	1071000	Shut up.
1071000	1073000	My WoW account got hacked.
1073000	1075000	And I was like, how the hell
1075000	1077000	did that happen? Did somebody get my password?
1077000	1079000	What kind of keylogger got on my computer?
1079000	1081000	Who else has my password? And then I figured
1081000	1083000	it out. You know how I am pretty convinced
1083000	1085000	somebody got my Warcraft password?
1085000	1087000	Because I used to play on my ex's computer.
1087000	1089000	And he was dumb enough to get all that spyware stuff.
1089000	1091000	So that's how they got my password
1091000	1093000	because I made the mistake of playing on someone
1093000	1095000	else's computer and it doesn't know better.
1095000	1097000	So, word of warning, everybody.
1097000	1099000	I do think that I've already uninstalled
1099000	1101000	World of Warcraft from my computer.
1101000	1103000	Even though I probably won't ever play it again,
1103000	1105000	I don't want them to get my account.
1105000	1107000	Because they would have stole your World of Warcraft account.
1107000	1109000	They would have stole all the gold
1109000	1111000	Rob gave me.
1111000	1113000	Oh, while I'm ex-bashing here on the show,
1113000	1115000	can I tell you something else I realized?
1115000	1117000	Which one?
1117000	1119000	It actually has to do with gaming.
1119000	1121000	You know which one. The one...
1121000	1123000	Oh!
1123000	1125000	There.
1125000	1127000	Because I don't want to
1127000	1129000	do slanderous or anything.
1129000	1131000	Here's the thing. I actually realized this today
1131000	1133000	while I was driving down and listening to another podcast.
1133000	1135000	You know how I've been really afraid to play
1135000	1137000	Starcraft 2 because I think it's too hard.
1137000	1139000	And I'm not really good at RTS games.
1139000	1141000	I'm really worried that the game is not...
1141000	1143000	I'm not going to be able to do well at the game.
1143000	1145000	Well, I realized that my ex
1145000	1147000	was a big Starcraft fan.
1147000	1149000	His online name was actually based out of the
1149000	1151000	Starcraft universe and everything. And it really hit me.
1151000	1153000	If that dumb fuck can play
1153000	1155000	Starcraft, I can play Starcraft!
1155000	1157000	So I'm going to go out and buy Starcraft 2 tomorrow.
1157000	1159000	I'm Jim Brainer 1262,
1159000	1161000	hardcore Starcraft fan.
1161000	1163000	Well,
1163000	1165000	you were still supposed to bring me something, Rob.
1165000	1169000	Oh,
1169000	1171000	I haven't been home.
1171000	1173000	I haven't been home.
1173000	1175000	If you put it on the easiest setting, by the way,
1175000	1177000	Starcraft 2 is like, hyper easy.
1177000	1179000	Is it really?
1179000	1181000	Like, die!
1181000	1183000	BlackWolf, our good pal who does the show before us
1183000	1185000	here at All Games Radio, which by the way, I don't remember
1185000	1187000	if I said this, but we do tape live every week at
1187000	1189000	www.allgames.com right after
1189000	1191000	Bobby BlackWolf's show.
1191000	1193000	Bobby BlackWolf says casual mode
1193000	1195000	is reasonable, Rob.
1195000	1197000	There you go. I guess that's cool.
1197000	1199000	Oh yeah, in my gaming week. I got Starcraft 2 last week.
1199000	1201000	How was it? You like it?
1201000	1203000	Can I play it? Am I smart enough to play it?
1203000	1205000	Yeah, that's what I said. It's not very hard.
1205000	1207000	If you play it on casual.
1207000	1209000	There's too many screenshots and stuff.
1209000	1211000	I'm like, there's too many units on the screen.
1211000	1213000	I can't handle this. It's too much.
1213000	1215000	I'm just, I'm weird, you guys.
1215000	1217000	Are you seeing this?
1217000	1219000	I don't play a lot of RTS.
1219000	1221000	This thing is amazing. Yeah, Jamie got that out when you were gone last week.
1221000	1223000	I was thumbing through it and I turned everything upside down and put it back.
1223000	1225000	Sweet.
1225000	1227000	Let's see.
1227000	1229000	I was asking for gaming accomplishments
1229000	1231000	and I didn't see a lot, but I do see
1231000	1233000	SalaciousPop in our chat room
1233000	1235000	says, I got up to stage
1235000	1237000	5 and Battletoads on one set of lives once.
1237000	1239000	Once. That's an accomplishment.
1239000	1241000	That is an accomplishment. Also, oh wow.
1241000	1243000	Also, I
1243000	1245000	beat the original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
1245000	1247000	NES game twice
1247000	1249000	with all four turtles alive.
1249000	1251000	That's pretty hardcore.
1251000	1253000	Yeah, that's pretty
1253000	1255000	tricky. That's a tough game.
1255000	1257000	The technodrome was actually a really
1257000	1259000	difficult boss.
1259000	1261000	Alright. Tigerclaw in chat
1261000	1263000	says, yeah, I play in casual mode, but the game is still
1263000	1265000	kicking my ass though. It's all about trial and error.
1265000	1267000	If you fuck up, just restart. See, Tigerclaw
1267000	1269000	and I need to play co-op because it's
1269000	1271000	like the blind leading the blind. That would be awesome.
1271000	1273000	Rage quit the team.
1273000	1275000	Rage quit the team. Yes. Rage quit together.
1275000	1277000	Alright.
1277000	1279000	I have my first rage quit, Rob.
1279000	1281000	Rage quit?
1281000	1283000	In Star Trek Online? Really?
1283000	1285000	Because my shit got blew up.
1285000	1287000	And I was like, fuck this. Exit.
1287000	1289000	I rage quit playing Genesis games last night.
1289000	1291000	Alright.
1291000	1293000	Ask Misty. Misty, I don't want to neglect you
1293000	1295000	and your gaming week. How was your gaming week?
1295000	1297000	Between work
1297000	1299000	and because of my
1299000	1301000	tendency to do a shift on two hours
1301000	1303000	of sleep and then crash after I get home.
1303000	1305000	Basically non-existent. Had some
1305000	1307000	obligatory Rock Band 2 time.
1307000	1309000	But
1309000	1311000	for some reason I... Don't forget to
1311000	1313000	talk in that mic, hon, or we can't hear you.
1313000	1315000	But basically non-existent.
1315000	1317000	Rock Band 2.
1317000	1319000	Bought some stupid Rainbow Unicorn
1319000	1321000	game. I blame Rob.
1321000	1323000	Rainbow Unicorn game is awesome.
1323000	1325000	Robot Unicorn Attack on iPhone.
1325000	1327000	What about the one where you get
1327000	1329000	ass, is it?
1329000	1331000	Pink anus. That's on Steam.
1331000	1333000	I have that game. I know you do.
1333000	1335000	Really? Yes.
1335000	1337000	There's a unicorn game and there's a...
1337000	1339000	How many times have I told the story on this show already?
1339000	1341000	There's a mineral or something that you use
1341000	1343000	to like, I don't know, perfect your unicorns.
1343000	1345000	Polish their horns, we'll say.
1345000	1347000	That is...
1347000	1349000	Anus. A-E-N-U-S.
1349000	1351000	So you collect pink anus
1351000	1353000	to polish their horns, basically.
1353000	1355000	I knew that, I just wanted to hear you say it.
1355000	1357000	Okay.
1357000	1359000	Alright, anyway.
1359000	1361000	Alright,
1361000	1363000	anything else for your gaming week, Misty?
1363000	1365000	Not really.
1365000	1367000	And by the way, you took a flight
1367000	1369000	out here for the first time, right? When was your first time
1369000	1371000	flying? Yes it was. How was it?
1371000	1373000	Was it that bad?
1373000	1375000	Surprisingly,
1375000	1377000	the only time I was really that nervous was during
1377000	1379000	takeoff. Alright. And then once you got
1379000	1381000	in the air, you just took a Valium and everything was okay?
1381000	1383000	No, I'm kidding. I'm kidding.
1383000	1385000	No, I had drugs in case
1385000	1387000	I needed them, though.
1387000	1389000	Just in case. Some standby.
1389000	1391000	But no, it wasn't too bad.
1391000	1393000	Hell, by about the time
1393000	1395000	we got over the Grand Canyon, I was
1395000	1397000	even kind of getting to the point where I could look
1397000	1399000	out the window for more than half a second before
1399000	1401000	having to look away. Oh, but looking out the
1401000	1403000	window is great. Actually, I like going over lakes
1403000	1405000	and taking pictures of them.
1405000	1407000	I like flying JetBlue or
1407000	1409000	Frontier or any airline that has the
1409000	1411000	television in the seat in front of me because
1411000	1413000	then I just, and I
1413000	1415000	literally did this once. I was on a flight to
1415000	1417000	New York, which is about five and a half hours from
1417000	1419000	SAC, or SF, and I watched
1419000	1421000	SpongeBob SquarePants the entire way.
1421000	1423000	It was the best flight I ever took. I didn't have to think
1423000	1425000	about the takeoff. I mean, yeah, it's
1425000	1427000	noisy, but otherwise it was like,
1427000	1429000	you know, SpongeBob SquarePants. Anyway.
1429000	1431000	Oh, but you bet I whipped out my
1431000	1433000	iPod as soon as they announced that we had
1433000	1435000	reached cruising altitude. And even
1435000	1437000	then I didn't buy the book I bought through the
1437000	1439000	Kindle app. Isn't that
1439000	1441000	funny? You'll bring all this shit and you're like, yeah, I'm gonna
1441000	1443000	watch a movie on the plane. I'm gonna play this game.
1443000	1445000	And then, like, you just fall asleep.
1445000	1447000	At least that's what I do. Well,
1447000	1449000	there's more attention span for me, but that
1449000	1451000	is part of the reason I made it a point not
1451000	1453000	to pack any physical books, just my
1453000	1455000	iPod and a notebook
1455000	1457000	for writing out my ghetto blog
1457000	1459000	mainly. I really like having my netbook
1459000	1461000	because it's, um, since I have, like, an
1461000	1463000	eight-hour battery on it,
1463000	1465000	I can just watch movies
1465000	1467000	and Doctor Who and stuff
1467000	1469000	the entire time. I'll tell you
1469000	1471000	what I still do on planes, and this
1471000	1473000	is old school. This is what, back in my
1473000	1475000	day, before we had a Game Boy,
1475000	1477000	this is what we did, okay?
1477000	1479000	And still, to this day, I
1479000	1481000	like to do this, is that, you know those
1481000	1483000	variety games books? They're like the
1483000	1485000	Penny Press variety crossword
1485000	1487000	puzzles and games? Like, they have the crosswords
1487000	1489000	and the anagram puzzles
1489000	1491000	and, you know, the logic puzzles and
1491000	1493000	all those. Surely someone in chat knows
1493000	1495000	what I'm talking about. I will buy, like, one
1495000	1497000	of those books at the, um,
1497000	1499000	you know, they always have, like, a newsstand, and that will
1499000	1501000	actually entertain me for a good couple hours on the flight
1501000	1503000	because those logic problems are hard, you guys.
1503000	1505000	The heck with the chatroom. I actually have
1505000	1507000	one somewhere in my room that my mom gave me before
1507000	1509000	ASEN that I was gonna do
1509000	1511000	on the train up to Chicago,
1511000	1513000	and I either lost
1513000	1515000	it or I just didn't do it. All I know
1515000	1517000	is it's sitting in my room undone still.
1517000	1519000	Let's be honest.
1519000	1521000	You wanna have fun on a plane, train, bus, whatever?
1521000	1523000	Mad Libs.
1523000	1525000	Mad Libs are great.
1525000	1527000	Mad Libs rule. Especially if you're like
1527000	1529000	loud Mad Libs. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1529000	1531000	If, like, you guys are all sitting a bunch of seats apart
1531000	1533000	and it's all your co-workers
1533000	1535000	or your friends, and everyone
1535000	1537000	on the plane is really, really annoyed
1537000	1539000	with you guys already, start doing
1539000	1541000	some Mad Libs. Oh my God.
1541000	1543000	It's the most fun you could possibly have.
1543000	1545000	But, Dan, keep in mind that
1545000	1547000	when I do travel, it's
1547000	1549000	usually alone, and I'm
1549000	1551000	unless I'm like with
1551000	1553000	you, Rob and Jamie, I'm not particularly
1553000	1555000	social on my
1555000	1557000	method of travel. Do Mad Libs with the people
1557000	1559000	next to you. Or do Mad Libs by yourself.
1559000	1561000	Just be like
1561000	1563000	You can do Mad Libs by yourself.
1563000	1565000	Just turn to the person next to you,
1565000	1567000	scary hobo, psycho killer,
1567000	1569000	housewife, whatever, and be like, hey,
1569000	1571000	you wanna throw down some Mad Libs?
1571000	1573000	If they say no, sit next to someone else.
1573000	1575000	Excuse me, ma'am. Excuse me, excuse me, ma'am.
1575000	1577000	Ma'am. Ma'am. Ma'am.
1577000	1579000	Ma'am. I need
1579000	1581000	an adjective.
1581000	1583000	Can I get an adverb?
1583000	1585000	Can I get a proper noun?
1585000	1587000	Hit the call button on the flight.
1587000	1589000	How can I help you today?
1589000	1591000	Excuse me, attendant? Yes, I need a noun.
1591000	1593000	I need
1593000	1595000	an adjective that ends in
1595000	1597000	Lee. And the good point is
1597000	1599000	and the good thing is you probably will see
1599000	1601000	any of those fuckers ever again.
1601000	1603000	I
1603000	1605000	need a transitive verb.
1605000	1607000	Or you can just use whatever words that they give you.
1607000	1609000	You don't have to worry about whether they give you
1609000	1611000	the right word or not. Hey, hey,
1611000	1613000	give me a word. F off. There you go. Perfect.
1613000	1615000	Those are gonna be some awesome
1615000	1617000	Mad Libs.
1617000	1619000	I
1619000	1621000	don't know what that has to do with games, but who cares.
1621000	1623000	Alright, housekeeping tonight.
1623000	1625000	Mad Libs is kind of a game.
1625000	1627000	Mad Libs are the best of
1627000	1629000	Do they have like a mad
1629000	1631000	They should have Mad Libs on Xbox Live.
1631000	1633000	I was just thinking Xbox Live Arcade
1633000	1635000	Mad Libs. Now that
1635000	1637000	1 versus 100 is gone,
1637000	1639000	it should be replaced by
1639000	1641000	Xbox Live Mad Libs.
1641000	1643000	And the funnier you can make them, the more points you get.
1643000	1645000	Hosted by Dan. Yeah.
1645000	1647000	I would be better than the guy who did 1 versus 100.
1647000	1649000	That's the most fun you can have with your clothes on.
1649000	1651000	Send in your adverb right now.
1651000	1653000	Do it. Do it.
1653000	1655000	Do it. You remember one time
1655000	1657000	back early in the show, I tried to do a
1657000	1659000	Mad Lib. Mad Libs for us.
1659000	1661000	I think I do remember.
1661000	1663000	SSJ 100 Matt has a good point.
1663000	1665000	He says, I totally want to sit between
1665000	1667000	Dan and Rob on a plane.
1667000	1669000	I don't blame you, Matt.
1669000	1671000	That would be awkward.
1671000	1673000	We should do 1 versus, or not 1 versus.
1673000	1675000	We should do Orange Land Radio Mad Libs.
1675000	1677000	You know, I was thinking the
1677000	1679000	same thing, but it was brought to my attention
1679000	1681000	that Understation Live has a segment called
1681000	1683000	USL Mad Libs. And if we star
1683000	1685000	our Mad Libs, I'm going to get a nasty
1685000	1687000	voicemail from Travis. Okay. Sorry, Travis.
1687000	1689000	We're doing them. Yeah.
1689000	1691000	One of these weeks. Ah, screw that.
1691000	1693000	Maybe even tonight
1693000	1695000	if I can find a book, we are doing Mad Libs.
1695000	1697000	Alright, alright, fine.
1697000	1699000	Go find a Mad Lib book, and we will
1699000	1701000	do Mad Libs in Part B. Don't even think
1701000	1703000	we don't have one. I know you got one somewhere.
1703000	1705000	Jamie, you must find our Mad Libs
1705000	1707000	book. Alright. You know, I found them the other day.
1707000	1709000	So hurry up and go to Kmart and get a new one or something.
1709000	1711000	We could do Chat Room Mad Libs.
1711000	1713000	Let them suggest. Right, exactly.
1713000	1715000	It's the show where every gamer
1715000	1717000	gives a noun. Everybody
1717000	1719000	gets their word
1719000	1721000	in Mad Libs.
1721000	1723000	Alright.
1723000	1725000	I think our chat room is really enjoying
1725000	1727000	having you on the show already. Without
1727000	1729000	Dan, there would not be Mad Libs. It's what we do.
1729000	1731000	Right. Housekeeping.
1731000	1733000	Tonight, first
1733000	1735000	my opponent. I deleted it!
1735000	1737000	Wait, that fucker.
1737000	1739000	I found that shit
1739000	1741000	and I owned it.
1741000	1743000	Awesome. Thank you, folks.
1743000	1745000	Good night.
1745000	1747000	Hey, where's my OS?
1747000	1749000	MT Recycle Bin. Hell to the yes.
1751000	1753000	Everyone, go on your computer and look for
1753000	1755000	MS008E
1755000	1757000	underscore 247 dot exe and delete
1757000	1759000	that shit for me, please. Her computer is gonna be like
1759000	1761000	I can't do that, Jamie.
1763000	1765000	Housekeeping, I wanted to apologize
1765000	1767000	that the last podcast is still not up on the
1767000	1769000	feed. It'll go up tonight. If I don't
1769000	1771000	do it Sunday or Monday, then I don't get around
1771000	1773000	to doing it at all. But you'll get two shows
1773000	1775000	on the feed this week. And here's the other
1775000	1777000	thing, guys, and I know it's gonna be really
1777000	1779000	sad, but we have to say it. There's
1779000	1781000	not going to be a show next week.
1781000	1783000	I'm sorry, but no-
1783000	1785000	Because of Rob. Well, I'd like
1785000	1787000	to think Loki's also partially to blame.
1787000	1789000	But I'm gonna be out of town
1789000	1791000	next weekend, so I will not be here.
1791000	1793000	Obviously, Matt is still on baby
1793000	1795000	leave. And Jamie, well,
1795000	1797000	she'll probably infect her computer or something else.
1797000	1799000	So she'll need to- I could just do it
1799000	1801000	myself. Just three hours
1801000	1803000	of Dan. Dan radio.
1803000	1805000	We hate him so
1805000	1807000	much. There's a button that you push.
1807000	1809000	All you do is wait for Bobby to say
1809000	1811000	push the button, and then
1811000	1813000	you push the button and you're live.
1813000	1815000	Radio is so fucking
1815000	1817000	easy. Especially shoutcast.
1817000	1819000	Hell, I even did the shoutcast
1819000	1821000	station for a little bit, took part in one.
1821000	1823000	It would be cool if I could pump up the volume again.
1823000	1825000	I won't be here. That would win.
1825000	1827000	Maybe we'll try to pre-tape
1827000	1829000	this week or something. Maybe.
1829000	1831000	I don't want to promise that. Rob. Rob. Rob. Rob.
1831000	1833000	What? What is one of my
1833000	1835000	major pet peeves using unnecessary
1835000	1837000	prefixes?
1837000	1839000	I have no idea what she's talking
1839000	1841000	about. You don't pre-tape,
1841000	1843000	you just tape. Don't you listen to George
1843000	1845000	Carlin?
1845000	1847000	Shut up.
1847000	1849000	Hey, I like having Dan on
1849000	1851000	the show.
1851000	1853000	No,
1853000	1855000	the moment that he says that, I start thinking of ways to
1855000	1857000	kill him, so. Alright.
1857000	1859000	And I start praying for death.
1859000	1861000	I think I'm done apologizing.
1861000	1863000	Facebook.com slash OrangeLivesRadio
1863000	1865000	join our Facebook. He hit me in the booby.
1867000	1869000	Hey, just so you know, it wasn't like
1869000	1871000	violence. I threw a gachamon at her.
1871000	1873000	I'll take a picture of it.
1873000	1875000	Sweet.
1875000	1877000	Do we even want to do gaming news tonight,
1877000	1879000	or should I just let the two of them go at it for three hours?
1879000	1881000	Welcome to our delightful marriage.
1881000	1883000	Doesn't Madden come out next week?
1883000	1885000	Doesn't Madden come out next week? I don't know.
1885000	1887000	Fuck Madden.
1887000	1889000	Yes, I will agree with that totally.
1889000	1891000	Here's the tragedy, okay?
1891000	1893000	If you talked to me a couple months ago,
1893000	1895000	and I still had a job, I would know
1895000	1897000	when Madden's coming out, because it would be like
1897000	1899000	my whole life. I'd be like,
1899000	1901000	oh man, I gotta get ready for Madden launch.
1901000	1903000	Oh man, how many Madden pre-orders do I have?
1903000	1905000	Now that it's not my whole life, I'm just
1905000	1907000	like, hey, isn't
1907000	1909000	that football game coming out?
1909000	1911000	Jesus, who cares?
1911000	1913000	Yeah, World Cup 94.
1913000	1915000	No, not football.
1915000	1917000	Football!
1917000	1919000	I thought
1919000	1921000	I saw some email about Madden
1921000	1923000	Midnight Madness. Oh look,
1923000	1925000	this page I'm on, look, the whole time
1925000	1927000	there's been this giant ad sitting there on the page
1927000	1929000	I'm on. Midnight launch at
1929000	1931000	Walmart, August 10th, so yes,
1931000	1933000	Madden's out tomorrow.
1933000	1935000	I'm awesome at this.
1935000	1937000	My favorite part is that the whole time
1937000	1939000	we were saying, I don't know, I don't know, it's sitting right
1939000	1941000	there on the screen.
1941000	1943000	But it's Madden, it won't matter, so it does not
1943000	1945000	matter. My screen has the Sega Genesis on it.
1945000	1947000	I can't do it.
1947000	1949000	Alright.
1949000	1951000	I regret nothing.
1951000	1955000	I would like, I wish
1955000	1957000	I wish I had more time to be an idiot.
1957000	1959000	It makes it so I know I don't want to fuck
1959000	1961000	Madden, I want Madden to go off and get
1961000	1963000	fucked.
1963000	1965000	Preferably in a big
1965000	1967000	flamey death. Here's the thing, I would love
1967000	1969000	to go out to the midnight launches
1969000	1971000	and do something for the
1971000	1973000	Madden launch.
1973000	1975000	That can happen before the fire happens.
1975000	1977000	No, because look, I have friends that play
1977000	1979000	Madden. You know what?
1979000	1981000	I was going to say, you've got to watch out for it, because
1981000	1983000	honestly enough, I've done many
1983000	1985000	many midnight launches. I've done halos,
1985000	1987000	I've done Grand Theft Autos, which are
1987000	1989000	by far the scariest.
1989000	1991000	Especially San Andreas, because our games
1991000	1993000	would have laid like five hours.
1993000	1995000	But Madden's are the one
1995000	1997000	midnight launch where dudes throw down and get into fights.
1997000	1999000	Wow.
1999000	2001000	Because you've got these people in line, and you know that they're the
2001000	2003000	obsessives because they get in line at like noon.
2003000	2005000	It's like, dude, we've got 700
2005000	2007000	copies. We're not running out.
2007000	2009000	The guy's like, oh, I've got to get my Madden.
2009000	2011000	Gotta get that Madden. Got that Madden!
2011000	2013000	So people are waiting for Madden.
2013000	2015000	Fuck your Madden prick.
2015000	2017000	Then they start having this argument about like,
2017000	2019000	oh man, the Raiders, this team, oh no,
2019000	2021000	this team, that team, and they're like about to throw
2021000	2023000	down. And I'm like, guys, guys, look, football.
2023000	2025000	And then they like run out in the parking lot
2025000	2027000	and start throwing around the football. It worked really
2027000	2029000	well. Because I thought they were going to
2029000	2031000	kill each other.
2031000	2033000	Here's the thing, though. If I make fun of
2033000	2035000	people that stand in line for Madden,
2035000	2037000	then I play World of Warcraft
2037000	2039000	and Dance Dance Revolution
2039000	2041000	for heaven's sakes. Like, you know,
2041000	2043000	it's, you can't like be
2043000	2045000	a Trekkie and then look at the guy obsessed with Star Wars
2045000	2047000	and call him a nerd, you know what I mean?
2047000	2049000	Sure you can.
2049000	2051000	It's called having a double standard.
2053000	2055000	It happens all the time!
2055000	2057000	It happens all the time!
2057000	2059000	I feel like as a responsible
2059000	2061000	gaming journalist,
2063000	2065000	That was funny.
2065000	2067000	I feel like
2067000	2069000	as the, I shouldn't,
2069000	2071000	you know, I'm not saying
2071000	2073000	make fun of people.
2073000	2075000	You know, it's just that you're supposed to make fun
2075000	2077000	of people different from you. Which is, in your case,
2077000	2079000	everybody. So,
2079000	2081000	you know, you just gotta get
2081000	2083000	on it. I remember we were waiting for the Dreamcast,
2083000	2085000	right? Were you there for, no you weren't there for, that was
2085000	2087000	kind of before... That was before I knew you kids.
2087000	2089000	That was for the whole Rob time. That's right.
2089000	2091000	We were waiting in line for Dreamcast,
2091000	2093000	and people were driving by and they were
2093000	2095000	making fun of us and we were just making fun of them back.
2095000	2097000	But it was Dreamcast, not fucking Madden.
2097000	2099000	What are you waiting for? We're like,
2099000	2101000	Pokemon cards!
2101000	2103000	What are you guys waiting for?
2103000	2105000	Beanie Babies!
2105000	2107000	And then this reporter showed up and started covering us
2107000	2109000	for the news, and we heckled her so
2109000	2111000	mercilessly that she ran off crying.
2111000	2113000	Midnight launch lines rule.
2113000	2115000	You've gotta do it.
2115000	2117000	We did the Wii thing, remember?
2117000	2119000	We did the donuts and coffee for the Wii.
2119000	2121000	I don't remember that.
2121000	2123000	Yeah, you didn't go, you were asleep.
2123000	2125000	I was sleeping because I had to go to a store the next day
2125000	2127000	and sell the four Wiis that I had.
2127000	2129000	Still, Beanie Babies and Pokey News.
2129000	2131000	Kristen and I were waiting in line and we bribed them for our spot
2131000	2133000	at the front of the line.
2133000	2135000	Yeah, because you got to cut to the front because there was
2135000	2137000	a listener of Orange Lawn's radio.
2137000	2139000	Like the one listener in Sacramento
2139000	2141000	happened to be at the front of the line.
2141000	2143000	Whatever works.
2143000	2145000	That's a great story too because Jamie says,
2145000	2147000	Oh yeah, me and Kristen are gonna go wait in line for the Wii
2147000	2149000	if I can get one, can I buy one?
2149000	2151000	And I'm like, yeah, yeah, you go on and do that.
2151000	2153000	Be sure to pick me up a copy of Zelda.
2153000	2155000	So I wake up the next day to go sell Wiis
2155000	2157000	and I look on my couch, there's a Wii sitting with a copy of Zelda.
2157000	2159000	I was like, son of a bitch.
2159000	2161000	How did she do that?
2161000	2165000	It's called contacts.
2165000	2167000	I guess.
2167000	2169000	I wonder if that guy still listens.
2169000	2171000	But as soon as Krispy Kreme opened,
2171000	2173000	Kris went out and got donuts.
2173000	2175000	Krispy Kreme is 24 hours, darlin'.
2175000	2177000	Not that one. It wasn't 24 hours.
2177000	2179000	If he does listen, thank you.
2179000	2181000	My wife spent $250 on a game console
2181000	2183000	that I've played like three times.
2183000	2187000	We've played it more than that.
2187000	2189000	Are you gonna play the new Metroid when it comes out?
2189000	2191000	Probably.
2191000	2193000	Can you play the new Sonic when it comes out?
2193000	2195000	I play everything a little bit. I won't play it on the Wii.
2195000	2197000	Sonic!
2197000	2199000	Can we actually get into some gaming news now?
2199000	2201000	Let me see, how far into the show are we tonight?
2201000	2203000	No, what if I refuse?
2203000	2205000	Hey! Whoever is in the chat room is
2205000	2207000	OLR recruit, you got five minutes to change your
2207000	2209000	nickname or I kick you.
2209000	2211000	Damn.
2211000	2213000	I know, you're on a power trip tonight.
2213000	2215000	What is up with this?
2215000	2217000	The program, Rob.
2217000	2219000	I've been fringing on her territory so
2219000	2221000	she has to be Alpha Jamie.
2221000	2223000	My E-peen
2223000	2225000	is so huge right now.
2227000	2229000	Nice.
2229000	2231000	So, gaming news.
2231000	2233000	I've got a ruler.
2233000	2235000	Once in a while, shove it up your ass.
2235000	2237000	Oh!
2237000	2239000	See, Rob? That's not appropriate.
2239000	2241000	Now now, Rob.
2241000	2243000	Bad. Bad Rob.
2243000	2245000	Now, aw,
2245000	2247000	you made the OLR recruit cry
2247000	2249000	because he or she does not know how to
2249000	2251000	change their name and they're very sad.
2251000	2253000	What the hell was that?
2253000	2255000	Alright.
2255000	2257000	You are walking home.
2257000	2259000	Alright.
2259000	2261000	Can I, can I... I somehow doubt it.
2261000	2263000	Can I, hello, can I, can I
2263000	2265000	do the gaming news now? Hello?
2265000	2267000	Hi, hello? Hi. Gaming news, the hell is that?
2267000	2269000	Rob. Hello? It's news
2269000	2271000	about gaming.
2271000	2273000	We need a theme song for gaming news.
2273000	2275000	Every other show on All Games has some theme song
2275000	2277000	when they go into gaming news. We do not have a theme song.
2277000	2279000	The Benny Hill theme. I've got one for you, Rob.
2279000	2281000	Yakety Sax.
2281000	2283000	For this episode, I just might have to...
2283000	2285000	Here's Rob's theme song.
2285000	2287000	What?
2287000	2289000	No, I was supposed to be the one
2289000	2291000	to bust out that app randomly.
2291000	2293000	Stop it right now.
2293000	2295000	What in the flippity fuck was that?
2295000	2297000	My Mozilla app.
2297000	2299000	You are deleting that.
2299000	2301000	If you're listening,
2301000	2303000	I need you to be back here.
2303000	2305000	Like, I know you have a baby.
2305000	2307000	Please come back
2307000	2309000	as soon as possible. I'm trying to help you get in the news.
2309000	2311000	I know you are. It's not my fault.
2311000	2313000	Everything is your fault, Dan.
2313000	2315000	Now we replace Jamie.
2315000	2317000	Sweet.
2317000	2319000	Alright.
2319000	2321000	Then you can sit in her desk.
2321000	2323000	Dan, keep in mind,
2323000	2325000	I know where you sleep.
2325000	2327000	And there's a Dave & Buster letter
2327000	2329000	opener right here with kind of sharp edges.
2329000	2331000	Kind of.
2331000	2333000	Gaming news? No, gaming news.
2339000	2341000	Xbox Live Indie
2341000	2343000	Games.
2343000	2345000	Might not be getting Kinect.
2345000	2347000	Alright, here's the deal.
2347000	2349000	A lot of folks might be thinking,
2349000	2351000	hey, Kinect is coming out soon.
2351000	2353000	Xbox Live has this whole
2353000	2355000	indie games thing. Why can't we have Kinect
2355000	2357000	games on Xbox Live? Well, because they don't
2357000	2359000	want to let you do it.
2359000	2361000	Look, this is because of an interview based with
2361000	2363000	Digital Spy.
2363000	2365000	A Microsoft spokesperson actually said that, quote,
2365000	2367000	only developers with established
2367000	2369000	contacts and
2369000	2371000	contracts with Microsoft
2371000	2373000	are going to be able to make the Kinect games.
2373000	2375000	Only those that Microsoft actually
2375000	2377000	partnered with for the launch are able
2377000	2379000	to make the Kinect games.
2379000	2381000	They haven't said that you will never
2381000	2383000	be able to make a Kinect game if you
2383000	2385000	are a developer for XNA. It's going
2385000	2387000	to be considered for the future,
2387000	2389000	but nothing is actually being considered at this
2389000	2391000	time. So sorry there will be no
2391000	2393000	Baby Maker
2393000	2395000	2000 or whatever that game is called
2395000	2397000	Kinect enabled at launch.
2397000	2399000	It does seem to me to be the dumbest thing
2399000	2401000	they could possibly do. Why is that?
2401000	2403000	Well, if you
2403000	2405000	think about it, all the video game
2405000	2407000	companies are going to be trying to do the same thing
2407000	2409000	the same way.
2409000	2411000	They're going to try to make the Kinect work.
2411000	2413000	It's going to be some maniac out there
2413000	2415000	with some indie game idea who's
2415000	2417000	going to come up with the idea that makes
2417000	2419000	the Kinect the must-have
2419000	2421000	object that people
2421000	2423000	will pay $150 for.
2423000	2425000	Because the thing is already $60
2425000	2427000	overpriced.
2427000	2429000	They're killing it. They're just
2429000	2431000	killing it.
2431000	2433000	It's killing its chances of becoming
2433000	2435000	the next big thing. Dan, I got to admit
2435000	2437000	Dance Central is pretty awesome.
2437000	2439000	You know you want to play Dance Central.
2439000	2441000	Dan, are you going to dance to Poker Face?
2441000	2443000	Probably not.
2443000	2445000	I'm not saying the Kinect is not a great idea.
2445000	2447000	I believe
2447000	2449000	in the Kinect. I believe in the
2449000	2451000	demonstrations I've seen. I think the
2451000	2453000	technology is amazing. I'm glad
2453000	2455000	to see that somebody is getting on it.
2455000	2457000	And that it's not Sony's
2457000	2459000	pathetic, we-controller
2459000	2461000	rip-off. But at the same
2461000	2463000	time, I just think from a
2463000	2465000	retailer's perspective, they're
2465000	2467000	charging too much for it.
2467000	2469000	And I just don't see it
2469000	2471000	doing anything different
2471000	2473000	yet. I mean, if something comes out
2473000	2475000	with the interactivity of
2475000	2477000	the Milo program
2477000	2479000	and
2479000	2481000	a great game is built
2481000	2483000	around it, and you can
2483000	2485000	stand around and
2485000	2487000	play that game,
2487000	2489000	it'll sell some Kinects, sure.
2489000	2491000	But you need something like
2491000	2493000	the Wii Bowling thing that got
2493000	2495000	everyone to believe in the Wii.
2495000	2497000	The thing on the Wii was, oh wow, that's kind of cool.
2497000	2499000	Wii Bowling's amazing! It's like bowling
2499000	2501000	in real life! And the Kinect doesn't
2501000	2503000	have that program.
2503000	2505000	Because you're not going to mainstream
2505000	2507000	people with Dance Central.
2507000	2509000	Even though it's by Harmonix and it's a great game
2509000	2511000	for Rob.
2511000	2513000	For me.
2513000	2515000	Well, because to you,
2515000	2517000	that's the kind of thing that you're into.
2517000	2519000	That's the kind of thing that you love. For me,
2519000	2521000	I was never really into the music rhythm games
2521000	2523000	except for Guitar Hero
2523000	2525000	and Guitar Freaks and whatnot.
2525000	2527000	Well, of course you're going to want it to.
2527000	2529000	That way you have to spend the money on it.
2529000	2531000	Maybe there will be a Red Dead Redemption Part 2
2531000	2533000	where you can actually choke a bitch.
2533000	2535000	Sure! Exactly!
2535000	2537000	Where I can lasso
2537000	2539000	everyone in town by waving my arm
2539000	2541000	and, wait, that didn't look so good.
2541000	2543000	That looks like I'm playing Dance Party there.
2543000	2545000	Or Dance Central.
2545000	2547000	But yeah, they just need to come up with
2547000	2549000	the right program, and I think that telling the indie
2549000	2551000	developers, yeah, you guys are out
2551000	2553000	on this is a big mistake.
2553000	2555000	If Choke-a-Bitch mode happened
2555000	2557000	in the next Red Dead Redemption,
2557000	2559000	I might even have to invest in that.
2559000	2561000	Screw Choke-a-Bitch mode. Someone just needs
2561000	2563000	to release a game called Choke-a-Bitch.
2563000	2565000	Even better.
2565000	2567000	Could you do that lasso motion one more time in Studio
2567000	2569000	Dam for us? Let's do the
2569000	2571000	lasso motion one more time.
2571000	2573000	Oh, darn it.
2573000	2575000	I screwed on the thing I was trying to do.
2575000	2577000	I was going to get Dan some music to do his
2577000	2579000	lassoing, too.
2579000	2581000	That's a poker face.
2581000	2583000	Come on, Dan.
2583000	2585000	Is it on YouTube?
2585000	2587000	Swing that hand, Dan.
2587000	2589000	That's classy.
2589000	2591000	Everything is on YouTube.
2591000	2593000	You know what? I like the piano version of that song.
2593000	2595000	I like the Cartman version.
2595000	2597000	I don't even know how I got into
2597000	2599000	Just Dance. There's a Cartman version? Why am I not
2599000	2601000	surprised? Other comments from our chatroom
2601000	2603000	at chat.orangelaunchradio.com
2603000	2605000	Let's see. Sj100matt
2605000	2607000	says that our good buddy and indie developer
2607000	2609000	YYR is pissed about this.
2609000	2611000	He was going to make Killer
2611000	2613000	Wheelchair Golden Girls game using
2613000	2615000	Kinect. See, that's what
2615000	2617000	Microsoft's afraid of.
2617000	2619000	Is that if they let the indie developers make
2619000	2621000	it, somebody's going to make the Golden Girls
2621000	2623000	game featuring Kinect, and then
2623000	2625000	that's going to be the must-have game.
2625000	2627000	Not dancing.
2627000	2629000	They still have ultimate control over what
2629000	2631000	release is.
2631000	2633000	Right?
2633000	2635000	Yes, but
2635000	2637000	if it's objectionable,
2637000	2639000	reject it.
2639000	2641000	XNA is a little different, because it's all
2641000	2643000	community-based, and
2643000	2645000	Microsoft, per se, I mean, yes,
2645000	2647000	they have ultimate control over it, but
2647000	2649000	they don't really babysit it. It's all
2649000	2651000	community-driven. It's like, what's the difference
2651000	2653000	being controlled by your controller and controlled
2653000	2655000	by Kinect? I think
2655000	2657000	it's probably a technical
2657000	2659000	problem. You know, I think that
2659000	2661000	the Kinect is not working out as well as I thought it
2661000	2663000	was already, and so now they're like,
2663000	2665000	oh, no, we just won't let the indie guys on it,
2665000	2667000	and, you know, we can
2667000	2669000	give the developers specific instructions
2669000	2671000	how to make the thing work.
2671000	2673000	They don't want to show all their cards,
2673000	2675000	basically. Maybe.
2675000	2677000	Anyhow, let's move on with more gaming news.
2677000	2679000	Dark Sakura, surely you have something you want to share with us tonight.
2679000	2681000	Well, it's about the move.
2681000	2683000	The move.
2683000	2685000	Hahahaha, Sony.
2685000	2687000	Well, they
2687000	2689000	are not going to have just a kiosk
2689000	2691000	for showing that they've actually
2691000	2693000	given me reps, Sony is,
2693000	2695000	to teach people how to use the move
2695000	2697000	in person. Ooh.
2697000	2699000	Is it that complex? Is it that
2699000	2701000	big of a deal? Yeah, and the
2701000	2703000	reps are all training on Nintendo Wiis.
2703000	2705000	But they are going
2705000	2707000	to be
2707000	2709000	giving seven hours of
2709000	2711000	move training to
2711000	2713000	people who already have a base knowledge
2713000	2715000	of Sony consoles.
2715000	2717000	And the competition.
2717000	2719000	Ooh.
2719000	2721000	Speaking of, um, stupid,
2721000	2723000	they're actually coming out.
2723000	2725000	What?
2725000	2727000	I don't...
2727000	2729000	And speaking of, um, stupid,
2729000	2731000	that was funny, so don't stop.
2731000	2733000	Okay, anyway, speaking of stupid, um,
2733000	2735000	there's actually accessories that are going to be
2735000	2737000	out with the move, like gloves.
2737000	2739000	Yes, they are
2739000	2741000	gloves.
2741000	2743000	And you can secure the move
2743000	2745000	thing to the glove
2745000	2747000	so that you don't drop it.
2747000	2749000	What else can you
2749000	2751000	secure to the glove? Probably a
2751000	2753000	cog.
2753000	2755000	Okay. It is kind of, well,
2755000	2757000	the move is kind of wide
2757000	2759000	like a good dildo, so maybe you could put a vibrator
2759000	2761000	in there.
2761000	2763000	Kay.
2763000	2765000	That's my wife, ladies and gentlemen!
2765000	2767000	No.
2767000	2769000	I'm just saying, I'm using my
2769000	2771000	imagination. You said what else could go in there that would be
2771000	2773000	useful. Joe Digitech in our chatroom is calling
2773000	2775000	him Love Gloves.
2775000	2777000	Cucumbers, Rob!
2777000	2779000	What if you're really, really
2779000	2781000	hungry, okay, get this, what if you're
2781000	2783000	really, really hungry and you're playing your move
2783000	2785000	and you don't really want to
2785000	2787000	have to let go of your cucumber to
2787000	2789000	play? Will it be cross
2789000	2791000	compatible with Nintendo Wii accessories?
2791000	2793000	Is it a bumpy cucumber? I bet you can use it
2793000	2795000	with a Wiimote!
2795000	2797000	Classic!
2797000	2799000	But yeah, stupid.
2799000	2801000	You guys could use them on your microphones.
2801000	2803000	That's true, we can use them on our microphones
2803000	2805000	but we don't drop them because we're too...
2805000	2807000	I guess maybe we don't have the
2807000	2809000	fine motor control or brain power
2809000	2811000	to understand. Open hand,
2811000	2813000	insert object, close hand.
2813000	2815000	Hold tightly!
2815000	2817000	Maybe? I think if you're going to release an accessory
2817000	2819000	that's so complex that you need to
2819000	2821000	train people to train people
2821000	2823000	for you to pay people to train
2823000	2825000	people how to use it. For seven hours
2825000	2827000	of training? Okay, but to be fair, to be fair,
2827000	2829000	fair Dan, let's be fair.
2829000	2831000	We're fair. A couple weeks ago on the show
2831000	2833000	we talked about Kinect doing demos
2833000	2835000	at Macy's.
2835000	2837000	So they are also sending
2837000	2839000	people out to teach them how to use Kinect
2839000	2841000	which really involves just
2841000	2843000	flailing. There isn't even
2843000	2845000	a controller to use. No gloves,
2845000	2847000	no cucumbers,
2847000	2849000	just you.
2849000	2851000	And your cucumber.
2851000	2853000	They didn't train anyone how to use iToy.
2853000	2855000	Well, we
2855000	2857000	saw how that went. Exactly. All they needed
2857000	2859000	to do was get the window washing game out there at
2859000	2861000	Macy's and it was sold like crazy.
2861000	2863000	That little game where you were like the ninja and you were like
2863000	2865000	standing on the screen and hitting all the little ninjas.
2865000	2867000	That was pretty fun.
2867000	2869000	So now, I guess it is, now people decide to
2869000	2871000	abuse Kinect. They can say
2871000	2873000	well we have people out there teaching them how to use it
2873000	2875000	right. It's not our
2875000	2877000	fault. We showed them how to do it. Well
2877000	2879000	companies do believe that all their users
2879000	2881000	are devastatingly stupid.
2881000	2883000	When my bank got new ATMs, they had a
2883000	2885000	couple days where people would stand outside and
2885000	2887000	teach you how to use the ATM. Nice.
2887000	2889000	They were called the ATM
2889000	2891000	ambassadors.
2891000	2893000	Did you have to use them? Because I'd be like
2893000	2895000	if they were like, do you need
2895000	2897000	help using the ATM? I'd be like, get the fuck out of here.
2897000	2899000	I don't want you seeing my pin. Unfortunately,
2899000	2901000	I wasn't using the ATM. I was taking my deposit
2901000	2903000	to the bank when I was working at the store.
2903000	2905000	Did you know that the new ATMs will actually
2905000	2907000	take your deposits? We would make fun of the ATM
2907000	2909000	ambassador every morning.
2911000	2913000	I don't think he liked me very much.
2913000	2915000	Yeah, but it was a job.
2915000	2917000	Pointing at him and laughing.
2917000	2919000	It was a job.
2919000	2921000	Our chat room is suggesting that as far as these gloves go,
2921000	2923000	you can get a glittery one for the new Michael
2923000	2925000	Jackson game.
2925000	2927000	Dot, dot, dot.
2927000	2929000	They're padded.
2929000	2931000	Is it just so that you don't
2931000	2933000	accidentally punch yourself in the face for something to do?
2933000	2935000	I'm gonna put
2935000	2937000	the picture of this in the chat room.
2937000	2939000	The new move helmet.
2939000	2941000	Don't
2941000	2943000	forget about the crayons that come as a pack
2943000	2945000	and snack.
2945000	2947000	Because
2947000	2949000	if you're playing games with the woo, the move,
2949000	2951000	you obviously need a helmet. The woo?
2951000	2953000	The woo. The woo?
2953000	2955000	I would like to see a console
2955000	2957000	named the woo. We have the wee and the woo.
2957000	2959000	There should be a console named the woos.
2959000	2961000	The woos? Like the maze.
2961000	2963000	Do you remember? Tangent time.
2963000	2965000	Actually, this is a reflow. We need the
2965000	2967000	little dream sequence.
2967000	2969000	Well, you got control. Make it happen.
2969000	2971000	I don't have every sound
2971000	2973000	ever known a man. You're killing me with this.
2973000	2975000	Look, look, look.
2975000	2977000	Back in the day, Nintendo Power
2977000	2979000	like sixth or seventh
2979000	2981000	issue, they actually profiled
2981000	2983000	a real life video game
2983000	2985000	that existed in Vacaville, California.
2985000	2987000	It was called the woos. Yeah.
2987000	2989000	And it was the maze. And that's what Dan's
2989000	2991000	referring to. That was a Nintendo Power, huh?
2991000	2993000	The Nintendo Power was awesome.
2993000	2995000	Twenty years ago, yes.
2995000	2997000	Oh yeah. Or whenever it started.
2997000	2999000	Back when Nintendo Power started, it was amazing.
2999000	3001000	And then GamePro came out
3001000	3003000	and we all made fun of it because it wasn't as good as Nintendo Power.
3003000	3005000	The woos Vacaville.
3005000	3007000	I was on like Team GamePro
3007000	3009000	or whatever it was called. There's a website up.
3009000	3011000	Yeah, it was like you had to write an essay
3011000	3013000	and they picked 250 people to be in their little club
3013000	3015000	and do you know what we did once we were in the club?
3015000	3017000	Nothing.
3017000	3019000	Yeah. So it's like I won
3019000	3021000	I don't even remember what I wrote my essay on
3021000	3023000	but yeah, it was a long time ago.
3023000	3025000	But sadly the woos is long gone.
3025000	3027000	They bulldozed the woos. Way gone.
3027000	3029000	I posted a link.
3029000	3031000	Is it a car dealership or an outlet mall?
3031000	3033000	Oh, that might be where they built the outlets.
3033000	3035000	I'm pretty sure that's where they built the outlets.
3035000	3037000	Oh, how sad.
3037000	3039000	So every time I go to the big
3039000	3041000	Calvin Klein outlet store
3041000	3043000	that was once...
3043000	3045000	That's what you do is you walk up and down the aisle
3045000	3047000	and the sales people are finally like, what are you doing?
3047000	3049000	I can't find my way out.
3049000	3051000	Okay, this is kind of funny.
3051000	3053000	I found a blog about it with an aerial view.
3053000	3055000	It probably was the same aerial view
3055000	3057000	that was in Nintendo Power years ago.
3057000	3059000	They would actually change the configuration.
3059000	3061000	I love how this starts. Back in the late 80s
3061000	3063000	things sucked. The music sucked.
3063000	3065000	The movie sucked. The entertainment slash things
3065000	3067000	that you do sucked. What the fuck are they smoking?
3067000	3069000	Back in the late 80s the movies rocked.
3069000	3071000	We had hella arcades then.
3071000	3073000	What a hell, author.
3073000	3075000	This person apparently is pooping on the woos.
3075000	3077000	It was born in 1991
3077000	3079000	so kiss my ass.
3079000	3081000	Alright, what's next?
3081000	3083000	Princess Bride did not suck.
3083000	3085000	Thank you.
3085000	3087000	Mystique came in and said,
3087000	3089000	hey, hey.
3089000	3091000	I don't even know what you're talking about.
3091000	3093000	Because the Princess Bride was like 87, 88.
3093000	3095000	Right.
3095000	3097000	And this guy says that there were no good movies in the late 80s
3097000	3099000	and therefore Mystique has just
3099000	3101000	made a logic
3101000	3103000	she's done a logic thing.
3103000	3105000	Wow, anything can happen once.
3105000	3107000	It's inconceivable.
3107000	3109000	I do not think that word
3109000	3111000	means what you think it means.
3111000	3113000	My head hurts.
3113000	3115000	Let's talk about
3115000	3117000	NBA Elite 11.
3117000	3119000	It comes with NBA Jam.
3119000	3121000	Thank you, Dan. That's what I was going to report.
3121000	3123000	That's a scam. It's a scam
3123000	3125000	because I have no interest in NBA
3125000	3127000	Elite 11 but I want NBA Jam
3127000	3129000	with a burning, fiery passion.
3129000	3131000	And I don't want to pay 60 bucks for it.
3131000	3133000	It's a fake.
3133000	3135000	What?
3135000	3137000	So just pretend you didn't hear that and I'm going to report
3137000	3139000	this news you've never heard before.
3139000	3141000	NBA Elite 11
3141000	3143000	will have a one-time download code
3143000	3145000	that will let you access
3145000	3147000	three modes of NBA Jam, Play Now,
3147000	3149000	Classic Campaign, and online.
3149000	3151000	This would explain why we saw ESRB ratings
3151000	3153000	last week.
3153000	3155000	They are not selling these separately, at least
3155000	3157000	for now. My gut tells me
3157000	3159000	where there's money to be made.
3159000	3161000	This is how it's going to work for like two months
3161000	3163000	or three months and then it'll be out for everybody.
3163000	3165000	Well sure, it's EA and EA is all
3165000	3167000	about the money but oh man.
3167000	3169000	For people like me who are idiots
3169000	3171000	who have been dying for NBA Jam
3171000	3173000	either I got to pay 50 bucks to get it
3173000	3175000	on the Wii or I got to pay 60
3175000	3177000	bucks to get it on the 360 rather
3177000	3179000	than paying the 15 bucks which I would be totally
3179000	3181000	willing to pay to get it on the 360.
3181000	3183000	Because
3183000	3185000	I love NBA Jam. I don't like
3185000	3187000	sports games but I love
3187000	3189000	NBA Jam.
3189000	3191000	I am in
3191000	3193000	your court.
3193000	3195000	I made a basketball joke.
3195000	3197000	That was awesome.
3197000	3199000	I hate you so much.
3199000	3201000	I don't like a lot of sports
3201000	3203000	games either but I love NBA
3203000	3205000	Jam, Double Dribble,
3205000	3207000	Blades of Steel. Oh, Blades of Steel
3207000	3209000	is sweet. It's like the best game
3209000	3211000	Konami ever made. I like the fact that you can play
3211000	3213000	Gradius at halftime. I know, right?
3213000	3215000	That's what everybody loves.
3215000	3217000	So sports games
3217000	3219000	aren't always like
3219000	3221000	missable for me. Like there's some
3221000	3223000	that you have to have. And I'm kind of in the same court
3223000	3225000	as you. They have to put the fun in. If they're
3225000	3227000	fun, you will play
3227000	3229000	them. How can I not
3229000	3231000	want NBA Jam on the 360
3231000	3233000	or even the PS3 because
3233000	3235000	360 means Xbox Live means I
3235000	3237000	can Boom Shakalaka
3237000	3239000	with my friends.
3239000	3241000	Right. That sounded dirty, Rob.
3241000	3243000	You could be like, puts it up.
3243000	3245000	Sweet touch.
3245000	3247000	Aw, NBA Jam is so cool.
3247000	3249000	I miss the old machines
3249000	3251000	where if you put in the right date you can play as
3251000	3253000	Mortal Kombat characters.
3253000	3255000	And Bill Clinton. That was the first
3255000	3257000	revision of NBA Jam Tournament
3257000	3259000	Edition. Hold on, though.
3259000	3261000	The way of looking at it that you just
3261000	3263000	said, Dan, is that I can pay $50
3263000	3265000	to have it on the Wii or I
3265000	3267000	could just wait and pay $15
3267000	3269000	for it on the Xbox 360. But that's assuming
3269000	3271000	it would be $15. What if
3271000	3273000	EA knows they have a premium
3273000	3275000	game here? What if you were looking at it
3275000	3277000	as I'm paying $60 for NBA
3277000	3279000	Jam and getting some other basketball game
3279000	3281000	for free? That's pretty graphics. Right. If it
3281000	3283000	was a full release, because the thing is I'll
3283000	3285000	never play NBA Elite 11.
3285000	3287000	I just never will. Not even once? Probably not.
3287000	3289000	Okay. Because I've
3289000	3291000	played NBA Live. I've
3291000	3293000	played NBA 2K. You know, and
3293000	3295000	honestly, in
3295000	3297000	this race, my
3297000	3299000	horse is definitely 2K.
3299000	3301000	It's just better. I mean, I
3301000	3303000	understand everyone out there. Oh, NBA
3303000	3305000	EA Sports, whatever. NBA
3305000	3307000	Live has just been atrocious
3307000	3309000	since like 2005.
3309000	3311000	But NBA Jam is awesome. Hence why it's
3311000	3313000	now NBA Elite. Exactly.
3313000	3315000	They finally said, okay, we're tired of getting our asses
3315000	3317000	kicked by 2K. We're going to change the
3317000	3319000	name. We're going to change the game. And then 2K is like,
3319000	3321000	Jordan, motherfuckers!
3321000	3323000	And then Elite was like, screw!
3323000	3325000	This sucks!
3325000	3327000	We'll put NBA Jam with
3327000	3329000	it! And I'm just like, oh, touche.
3329000	3331000	Touche EA. Very well
3331000	3333000	played. A2 EA?
3333000	3335000	Yeah, whatever. Yeah, I
3335000	3337000	want NBA Jam bad.
3337000	3339000	Tigerclaw in our chatroom
3339000	3341000	says, think about it. If NBA Jam had
3341000	3343000	online, we can try to represent the OL Army
3343000	3345000	in the big battles sometime in the future.
3345000	3347000	I completely forgot to mention Big Battle
3347000	3349000	during housekeeping because I got derailed. Something about
3349000	3351000	Mad Libs, but something
3351000	3353000	that the listeners have been asking
3353000	3355000	for forever is coming to the
3355000	3357000	Big Battle. A music game.
3357000	3359000	That's right. Guitar Hero 5 is now in the Big Battle.
3359000	3361000	So check it out. TheBigBattle.net
3361000	3363000	There you go. And if OLR
3363000	3365000	doesn't win the music game competition,
3365000	3367000	I don't, like,
3367000	3369000	like, really? Really?
3369000	3371000	I will disown all of you. No, I'm kidding.
3371000	3373000	I think my solution is if somebody
3373000	3375000	is buying NBA Elite and doesn't
3375000	3377000	care about NBA Jam, I will
3377000	3379000	buy their download code from them.
3379000	3381000	You're not gonna find that person.
3381000	3383000	You're killing me with this, Rob.
3383000	3385000	Well, I'm not gonna
3385000	3387000	buy it all special and shit.
3387000	3389000	See, I'm looking at it this
3389000	3391000	way. What if instead of looking
3391000	3393000	at it as I'm buying this game
3393000	3395000	and getting ripped off with this game
3395000	3397000	I don't even want, what if, okay, NBA
3397000	3399000	Jam on the Wii cost me
3399000	3401000	$50, I could pay
3401000	3403000	$10 more to get it on the 360,
3403000	3405000	which is, you know, pretty much what
3405000	3407000	most premium usually is.
3407000	3409000	You have to look at it the other way around.
3409000	3411000	I mean, sure, I want
3411000	3413000	it to come out for $15, too, but
3413000	3415000	you know, think about how the Wii
3415000	3417000	folks would be in an uproar if it was like, well,
3417000	3419000	it's $15 there but you're gonna charge me $50?
3419000	3421000	F you.
3421000	3423000	The Wii version gets extra modes.
3423000	3425000	I guess that's true, they do have extra modes.
3425000	3427000	They get like the classic Super
3427000	3429000	Star Tour and stuff, which I could care
3429000	3431000	less about. Alright.
3431000	3433000	Alright, let's, uh,
3433000	3435000	let's move on for more news. Can I just completely
3435000	3437000	get away from sports, please? Yes, you may.
3437000	3439000	Let's take a deep
3439000	3441000	breath of air.
3441000	3443000	If we were talking about
3443000	3445000	rugby or cricket... NBA
3445000	3447000	DJ Max
3447000	3449000	portable 3
3449000	3451000	has, um,
3451000	3453000	some, uh, new features.
3453000	3455000	It's, uh, and keep in mind this is
3455000	3457000	not a game that I have really played much
3457000	3459000	if any of, but they have
3459000	3461000	a, um, 3-track remixing
3461000	3463000	system that's made just for that
3463000	3465000	particular version. Um,
3465000	3467000	and, uh,
3467000	3469000	it, I was watching the video
3469000	3471000	of it while you were going off on,
3471000	3473000	um, NBA, whatever.
3473000	3475000	And, um,
3475000	3477000	but they're saying that, um,
3477000	3479000	that it's supposed to actually
3479000	3481000	be a completely revamped system.
3481000	3483000	It looks kinda neat.
3483000	3485000	Did they put a mode in the game that will
3485000	3487000	make it fun? I'm kidding,
3487000	3489000	I'm kidding, DJ Max is fine. DJ Max is,
3489000	3491000	it's BeatMania 2DX with buttons on your PS3
3491000	3493000	and it's fine, I'm just giving it a hard time.
3493000	3495000	I just wanted, like, some of the DJ Max
3495000	3497000	fans to sit there and
3497000	3499000	make this. The music is actually sounding
3499000	3501000	kinda cool. The music's neat.
3501000	3505000	This is a great radio, we're just sitting here.
3505000	3507000	I don't know what that is, but that gave me
3507000	3509000	a headache.
3509000	3511000	Ah, creepy girl with no eyes.
3511000	3513000	Alright.
3513000	3515000	I don't know, uh, I'm glad they're putting in some new
3515000	3517000	modes and some new ideas so it doesn't just
3517000	3519000	feel like a 2DX port. It's kinda cool.
3519000	3521000	And, you know, to be fair, they have had
3521000	3523000	some other stuff, like, they do, like, like a
3523000	3525000	3-button mode, a 6-button mode, a
3525000	3527000	11 billion button mode. They do
3527000	3529000	all these different, like, modes and tricks
3529000	3531000	with it. Somebody else's PSP mode,
3531000	3533000	somebody's Wii mode.
3533000	3535000	I would like to see 2DX on the
3535000	3537000	PSP. I would like to see 2DX
3537000	3539000	on the PS3. With the Konami-style
3539000	3541000	2DX PSP controller.
3541000	3543000	Like, where is my PlayStation
3543000	3545000	3 version, like, of 2DX?
3545000	3547000	Why has that not come out yet?
3547000	3549000	I thought 2DX was over.
3549000	3551000	No, it's still going in the arcades in Japan.
3551000	3553000	Oh, I thought that they actually did a final version.
3553000	3555000	They did a final BeatMania.
3555000	3557000	They did BeatMania 1
3557000	3559000	and they did BeatMania 3 final,
3559000	3561000	but they never did a BeatMania 2 Deluxe final.
3561000	3563000	Interesting. That's still going.
3563000	3565000	They're on, like, what...
3565000	3567000	98th style, U6. I don't know, they're on, like,
3567000	3569000	18th or 19th style. They're a lot.
3569000	3571000	Nice. Because it proved popular
3571000	3573000	and has longevity.
3573000	3575000	It's a neat game. It's because that arcade machine
3575000	3577000	is amazing. The next one's gonna be
3577000	3579000	with remix mode or some shit in it.
3579000	3581000	It's so good.
3581000	3583000	Well, if you like these DJ games, maybe
3583000	3585000	DJ Hero 2 is something you're interested in.
3585000	3587000	I know I am, actually. The first DJ Hero game
3587000	3589000	was really underrated. Why are you laughing at me?
3589000	3591000	Oh, you told me I was gonna jump in and say,
3591000	3593000	but probably not.
3593000	3595000	No, DJ Hero 2 is gonna
3595000	3597000	have, of course, the multiplayer mode. And DJ Hero
3597000	3599000	1 had that too, but one thing that was missing when
3599000	3601000	you would play online is rewind.
3601000	3603000	That's right. Now you can
3603000	3605000	rewind in multiplayer mode.
3605000	3607000	You couldn't do that before, but now you're actually
3607000	3609000	gonna get to rewind. So once you get enough power
3609000	3611000	in the multiplayer mode, you're gonna be able to spin
3611000	3613000	the thing backwards and you rewind the track
3613000	3615000	and get more points. So in DJ Hero 2,
3615000	3617000	this will be in there. And what
3617000	3619000	happens is that while you rewind, your opponent
3619000	3621000	gets to do nothing while you
3621000	3623000	rack up the points.
3623000	3625000	So that'll be kinda fun.
3625000	3627000	Yeah, that's gonna get pretty ugly.
3627000	3629000	I'm just looking forward to
3629000	3631000	the rapping in it and how that'll play out online.
3631000	3633000	Actually, Dan, I would love to do
3633000	3635000	some DJ Hero where I will do the DJ and you do
3635000	3637000	the rapping. Wouldn't that be fun?
3637000	3639000	You know what we need?
3639000	3641000	I would throw down. We need Dan
3641000	3643000	playing Def Jam Rap Star.
3643000	3645000	Is this out yet?
3645000	3647000	I think it's coming out soon.
3647000	3649000	I heard about that and that sounds amazing.
3649000	3651000	Here's the thing, you guys.
3651000	3653000	I know not everybody is into rap music.
3653000	3655000	I can
3655000	3657000	give or take it, depending on who the artist is.
3657000	3659000	But the music game that they're doing
3659000	3661000	actually looks really good.
3661000	3663000	They had Def
3663000	3665000	Jam Rap Star sitting next to
3665000	3667000	Glee Karaoke Revolution.
3667000	3669000	And I will tell you what,
3669000	3671000	Def Jam Rap Star
3671000	3673000	popped a cap in Glee's ass so
3673000	3675000	fast it's not even funny because the Glee game
3675000	3677000	was terrible. It's terrible.
3677000	3679000	Well, first of all, anything that Konami
3679000	3681000	I mean, I hate to say this because I have
3681000	3683000	great love for Konami. But anything that Konami
3683000	3685000	does these days is pretty bad.
3685000	3687000	Dance Masters looks
3687000	3689000	interesting. It's the first really
3689000	3691000	really interesting music game I've seen from them in a while.
3691000	3693000	Who knows? But the budget's gone.
3693000	3695000	Konami is not into
3695000	3697000	gaming like they were. There's just not
3697000	3699000	a lot of...
3699000	3701000	Well, they closed one of their
3701000	3703000	offices that was a huge part of it.
3703000	3705000	They closed a lot of it. I mean, a lot of Konami
3705000	3707000	is just history. All the good talent is
3707000	3709000	gone.
3709000	3711000	They're basically outsourcing
3711000	3713000	their franchises to make some money, but
3713000	3715000	yeah, anything that Konami
3715000	3717000	does is
3717000	3719000	pretty cut rate these days.
3719000	3721000	Not to get off topic, but what do you think of that
3721000	3723000	Castlevania game that's coming out? The Castlevania
3723000	3725000	God of War thing?
3725000	3727000	Hopefully going to be okay?
3727000	3729000	I mean, Castlevania
3729000	3731000	in 3D is pretty miss and miss.
3731000	3733000	Not that
3733000	3735000	Lament of Innocence
3735000	3737000	and Curse of Darkness was the
3737000	3739000	other one. Those weren't the worst
3739000	3741000	3D action games to ever happen, but
3741000	3743000	they weren't the quality of what you'd
3743000	3745000	consider Castlevania. The new one
3745000	3747000	looks really good.
3747000	3749000	They say they got Kojima on it
3749000	3751000	and Kojima's kind of
3751000	3753000	Konami's only superstar that's
3753000	3755000	really left, so
3755000	3757000	if it's awesome, great.
3757000	3759000	I just don't know
3759000	3761000	I just don't have a lot of
3761000	3763000	you know, hope for
3763000	3765000	3D Castlevania. If I play it and I like it
3765000	3767000	I'm going to be pleasantly surprised. If you like
3767000	3769000	God of War, I think you'll like it. It's very pretty.
3769000	3771000	It's much sexier than
3771000	3773000	the other 3D games. Of course it's on a different
3773000	3775000	console too. It looks great. But I totally
3775000	3777000	get what you're saying because Symphony of the Night was easily
3777000	3779000	easily one of the top 10 video games
3779000	3781000	ever made. Symphony of the Night is
3781000	3783000	there's almost no equal.
3783000	3785000	I still like Run to a Blood better.
3785000	3787000	And so it's kind of like every Castlevania game since then
3787000	3789000	it just hasn't compared.
3789000	3791000	Yeah.
3791000	3793000	Well, they're all building off of that formula
3793000	3795000	and you know, they're all
3795000	3797000	all the 2D ones are, you know
3797000	3799000	they're all portables and you know
3799000	3801000	they lose points for that.
3801000	3803000	Not that they're bad, but yeah.
3803000	3805000	I really like Portrait of Ruin when I got through it.
3805000	3807000	Portrait of Ruin was a great game.
3807000	3809000	Let's see, SalaciousPop in our chatroom
3809000	3811000	says, Konami only seems to burp up new flavors
3811000	3813000	of Castlevania and Silent Hill. What was
3813000	3815000	their last really new IP?
3815000	3817000	Saw.
3817000	3819000	Hahahaha
3819000	3821000	Hahahaha
3821000	3823000	Okay. I'm actually trying to think.
3823000	3825000	SHJ100 Matt
3825000	3827000	is still waiting on a new Zone of Enders game.
3827000	3829000	Everybody who came into the store and
3829000	3831000	saw there was a Saw game, everybody was like
3831000	3833000	there's a Saw game?
3833000	3835000	Is it any good?
3835000	3837000	I don't know. No one's ever played it.
3837000	3839000	I've heard from people that can stomach
3839000	3841000	those kind of games that it's actually
3841000	3843000	not as bad as you'd think. And you know what? I did
3843000	3845000	I did play, well I watched
3845000	3847000	I watched Shane play the second
3847000	3849000	games demo at E3 and
3849000	3851000	it was interesting except for
3851000	3853000	all the gore. I just don't like
3853000	3855000	that stuff. But yet I love
3855000	3857000	Silent Hill. I can't explain it.
3857000	3859000	Silent Hill isn't
3859000	3861000	well, it's a different kind of gore. It's more of a
3861000	3863000	decay. And I feel like
3863000	3865000	Saw is more like LOL gore.
3865000	3867000	Like it's just like random. LOL gore.
3867000	3869000	Here's how I put it.
3869000	3871000	Look at the violence.
3871000	3873000	Where Saw is
3873000	3875000	fresh, squirting, pulsating blood.
3875000	3877000	Silent Hill is, it's been
3877000	3879000	dead for a while, but it's still twitching.
3879000	3881000	Or the gore serves
3881000	3883000	as much as I hate to say this, a
3883000	3885000	plot point, as weird as that is.
3885000	3887000	It's for scene, not for
3887000	3889000	shock. Check out his head, it's a pyramid.
3889000	3891000	Yes.
3891000	3893000	Dude, this guy's wearing a big metal triangle
3893000	3895000	on his head. Triangle man.
3895000	3897000	Triangle man.
3897000	3899000	How about another
3899000	3901000	piece of gaming news, Dark
3901000	3903000	Sakura? News? That's fantastic.
3903000	3905000	This made me laugh my ass off, Rob.
3905000	3907000	Nipponichi,
3907000	3909000	the company that made
3909000	3911000	Disgaea, is doing a game called Criminal Girls
3911000	3913000	for PSP. And
3913000	3915000	it's like bad 70's
3915000	3917000	chicks in prison
3917000	3919000	is what it is.
3919000	3921000	This sounds awesome.
3921000	3923000	Was it directed by Quentin Tarantino?
3923000	3925000	Is Lizzie Lohan in it?
3925000	3927000	Aw man, Machete's gonna be great.
3927000	3929000	No, but Lady Gaga is.
3929000	3931000	Sorry. Good enough.
3931000	3933000	Oh, is it gonna be like the telephone music video
3933000	3935000	for real? Cause that's awesome.
3935000	3937000	Can I create the cam story? No.
3937000	3939000	Not tonight.
3939000	3941000	Anyway, you play as
3941000	3943000	an all female prison warden
3943000	3945000	that's set in hell.
3945000	3947000	And you have to rehabilitate
3947000	3949000	seven prisoners, and each of the
3949000	3951000	prisoners are like seven deadly sins.
3951000	3953000	So you have gluttony, greed, lust,
3953000	3955000	you know.
3955000	3957000	Is it home for infinite losers?
3957000	3959000	Misty comes in and asks, is it the home for
3959000	3961000	infinite losers? You don't have a microphone.
3961000	3963000	That's what she keeps doing.
3963000	3965000	If you're gonna say something, come in and grab the microphone.
3965000	3967000	Just take Misty's when she's not looking.
3967000	3969000	So you know how you have to rehabilitate
3969000	3971000	them, Rob? How?
3971000	3973000	With spankings and massages.
3973000	3975000	I read about this. Cause here's the deal.
3975000	3977000	Nipponichi had
3977000	3979000	to cancel like three projects.
3979000	3981000	You okay?
3981000	3983000	Breathe, Dark Soccer,
3983000	3985000	breathe. You alright?
3985000	3987000	It's really not that funny. Nipponichi
3987000	3989000	had to cancel like three or four projects
3989000	3991000	and this is the one that they kept.
3993000	3995000	I'm actually
3995000	3997000	getting scared a little bit, Dark Soccer, are you
3997000	3999000	okay? Only a little bit?
3999000	4001000	Spanking
4001000	4003000	and massages.
4003000	4007000	Does it work
4007000	4009000	with the Kinect?
4009000	4011000	It's on the
4011000	4013000	PSP.
4013000	4015000	Does it work with the Kinect anyway?
4015000	4017000	Probably.
4017000	4019000	I'm sure someone will find a way.
4019000	4021000	I am...
4021000	4023000	So wait, let me
4023000	4025000	get this straight again. You are
4025000	4027000	in a prison
4027000	4029000	in hell and you
4029000	4031000	spank people to
4031000	4033000	massage them.
4033000	4035000	Or massage them, right? Is that what I heard?
4035000	4037000	I think, ladies and gentlemen...
4043000	4045000	Video game of the year 2010.
4047000	4049000	There's pictures. Let me find the picture.
4049000	4051000	It was...
4051000	4053000	Oh my gosh.
4053000	4055000	Was the secret word spank?
4055000	4057000	Did Pee Wee Herman
4057000	4059000	come out before the show?
4059000	4061000	It was in Dengeki
4061000	4063000	PlayStation magazine.
4063000	4065000	You know, maybe I
4065000	4067000	missed the break during Bobby's show tonight.
4067000	4069000	Did he come out and say, today's secret
4069000	4071000	word is spank.
4071000	4073000	Oh, so that's why I missed it.
4073000	4075000	If somebody says spank, scream real loud.
4075000	4077000	Are you okay, Dark Soccer?
4077000	4079000	I'm going to put the link to the picture
4079000	4081000	in there of
4081000	4083000	what the characters
4083000	4085000	look like with their ginormous
4085000	4087000	boobies. And again, to listen live,
4087000	4089000	we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock
4089000	4091000	Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, and
4091000	4093000	I know this makes for terrible radio, but I'm looking
4093000	4095000	at this. Of course, they have gigantic
4095000	4097000	tits.
4097000	4099000	And they're like doing that whole blushing
4099000	4101000	thing. It looks like, see how like, okay,
4101000	4103000	notice this, like the top of their tits is
4103000	4105000	red. That's either like a really bad
4105000	4107000	sunburned tan. It's boob blush.
4107000	4109000	Or they're getting spanked on their tits.
4109000	4111000	Probably. Oh, even better, it's boob blush.
4113000	4115000	I can tell you... Women actually
4115000	4117000	blush their boobies? I didn't know that.
4117000	4119000	Boobs can blush. Have you ever blushed your
4119000	4121000	boobs? Not on purpose.
4123000	4125000	This tells you how bad
4125000	4127000	off the Japanese gaming market is.
4127000	4129000	Did Dan just have red stuff on his face
4129000	4131000	and he just went...
4135000	4137000	They're not very red right now. This is a
4137000	4139000	story about how bad the Japanese gaming
4139000	4141000	market is. That's red!
4141000	4143000	They're killing their important projects and they're
4143000	4145000	keeping this. They know who their
4145000	4147000	market is. Well, right, because that's the
4147000	4149000	people in Japan who are buying the games or the
4149000	4151000	psycho pervert otakus. Um, I'm
4151000	4153000	sorry, but this game sounds
4153000	4155000	awesome. And why are you
4155000	4157000	knocking it? Because we should be getting this game
4157000	4159000	as well. We won't, but we should.
4159000	4161000	This is President Cat 2010
4161000	4163000	right here. I want this game.
4163000	4165000	I still want President Cat! Damn it, me too.
4165000	4167000	Why have you not
4167000	4169000	done this for me, husband?
4169000	4171000	I have no idea what you're talking about.
4171000	4173000	President Cat! Your husband doesn't actually
4173000	4175000	listen to this show. He just likes to come on once in a while
4175000	4177000	and bring the lols. I
4177000	4179000	know about the existence of President
4179000	4181000	Cat, but I don't really know what she's
4181000	4183000	talking about.
4183000	4185000	That's alright.
4185000	4187000	Hey, let's get into what video games
4187000	4189000	are coming out soon and around
4189000	4191000	the world. We're going to travel the world and look at release
4191000	4193000	dates, and we'll start in America.
4193000	4195000	America.
4195000	4197000	Coming out this...
4197000	4199000	You said
4199000	4201000	America, Rob, so I was just representing.
4201000	4203000	I hope the mic didn't pick that up.
4203000	4205000	You know the mic turns off, you know.
4205000	4207000	Mine doesn't. I was just representing.
4207000	4209000	Ooh, thank you. AlphaKananagram in chat brings up a good point.
4209000	4211000	The PSP is region-free, so
4211000	4213000	it's less of a pain than region-locked President
4213000	4215000	Cat. Good job.
4215000	4217000	Love it. Alright, coming out this week in America,
4217000	4219000	Madden NFL 11.
4219000	4221000	Of course, we already talked about that before. It's coming out on the
4221000	4223000	10th, and there's midnight launches going on everywhere.
4223000	4225000	And do any games
4225000	4227000	dare to compete against Madden
4227000	4229000	11? I don't think
4229000	4231000	so. There's not a lot else coming out.
4231000	4233000	Let me see what counter... There's also tons and tons
4233000	4235000	and tons of
4235000	4237000	peripherals and things coming out.
4237000	4239000	But as far as games coming out against
4239000	4241000	Madden 11, nope.
4241000	4243000	This is Madden's week. That's it for the US.
4243000	4245000	Meanwhile in England, they're like,
4245000	4247000	Madden, that's a game
4247000	4249000	for wankers!
4249000	4251000	We have
4251000	4253000	coming out on the 10th,
4253000	4255000	Dragon Age Golems of Amgarak.
4255000	4257000	Um,
4257000	4259000	on 11th, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World.
4259000	4261000	On the 12th, yeah, Madden NFL 11.
4261000	4263000	Like, anyone's gonna give a crap about it over there.
4263000	4265000	Um, 13 is Hoop World.
4265000	4267000	And Ship Simulator Extremes.
4267000	4269000	That's it.
4269000	4271000	I gotta say,
4271000	4273000	just tangent a little bit,
4273000	4275000	I didn't know much about that whole Scott Pilgrim vs.
4275000	4277000	the World thing. I didn't realize
4277000	4279000	that it's based on a comic book
4279000	4281000	where clearly the author has a huge
4281000	4283000	boner for video games, because there's so
4283000	4285000	many video game references in it.
4285000	4287000	Uh oh, Mystique's coming in.
4287000	4289000	And he's Canadian.
4289000	4291000	Well then, fuck him!
4291000	4293000	I'm just kidding.
4293000	4295000	He's from Canadia. I love Canadia.
4295000	4297000	All right.
4297000	4299000	Is that near Albonia?
4299000	4301000	Look, look, I have Canadian friends,
4301000	4303000	okay? Okay?
4303000	4305000	I'm sorry. All right.
4305000	4307000	I like the Canadianites.
4307000	4309000	No, for real though. Uh oh.
4309000	4311000	Mystique's coming in.
4311000	4313000	We're here. We're here. Flap, flap, flap.
4313000	4315000	Because she's wearing, I think, flip flops or something.
4315000	4317000	Smack, smack, smack, smack, smack, smack.
4317000	4319000	Never mind.
4319000	4321000	So, but here's the thing.
4321000	4323000	At first I had no interest in seeing the movie
4323000	4325000	because I was like, oh, it's Michael Cera
4325000	4327000	and it's not Arrested Development.
4327000	4329000	So why would I care, right?
4329000	4331000	But then I hear it's all about this
4331000	4333000	video game, like, homage.
4333000	4335000	And then the whole, like, thing where they actually
4335000	4337000	went to Miyamoto to get the rights to use
4337000	4339000	the Zelda music in the thing.
4339000	4341000	And the comic book is about, like, he goes
4341000	4343000	to defeat the ex-boyfriends
4343000	4345000	who are, like, the seven bosses.
4345000	4347000	Or, I shouldn't say they're not
4347000	4349000	all ex-boyfriends.
4349000	4351000	One of them's a girl, but still.
4351000	4353000	It's like the harem of boss monsters
4353000	4355000	that are the exes of this chick
4355000	4357000	he's interested in. It's like the plot.
4357000	4359000	And I'm like, that actually sounds, like,
4359000	4361000	kind of awesome in an 11-year-old way.
4361000	4363000	I want to go see it.
4363000	4365000	Let's go see it.
4365000	4367000	I think that movie does sound completely sweet.
4367000	4369000	So I had no idea.
4369000	4371000	Dan, take me on a date.
4371000	4373000	I'm not dating all of you.
4373000	4375000	Misty.
4375000	4377000	Misty Wood.
4377000	4379000	I'll take Mystique out on a date.
4379000	4381000	Because Alan's in San Francisco, so Mystique
4381000	4383000	can be my date.
4383000	4385000	But no Nookie.
4385000	4387000	Rob's got jungle fever.
4387000	4389000	If we call
4389000	4391000	Alan, can we watch?
4391000	4393000	Stop it.
4393000	4395000	Stop it.
4395000	4397000	They're filthy, disgusting pervs.
4397000	4399000	You hang out with us.
4399000	4401000	Xbox 360 in Japan. How about Japanese
4401000	4403000	releases? I guess.
4403000	4405000	Here's a sport they love in Japan. Baseball.
4405000	4407000	Major League Baseball 2K10 is out from 2K Sports
4407000	4409000	this week in Japan. And it can't even sell
4409000	4411000	there.
4411000	4413000	I think it does alright over there.
4413000	4415000	I don't know. They're big, big.
4415000	4417000	They got the big boner for baseball in Japan.
4417000	4419000	Even bigger than here.
4419000	4421000	MLB 2K.
4421000	4423000	Sports of Japan.
4423000	4425000	Sumo and Baseball.
4425000	4427000	That might actually be their big release this week.
4427000	4429000	But I have to say this. On the Nintendo Wii.
4429000	4431000	It's not this week. It's coming out August 26th.
4431000	4433000	But I'm sorry. This is the greatest name for
4433000	4435000	video game ever. Are you ready for this?
4435000	4437000	On the Wii. This is super spanking massage.
4437000	4439000	Close. August 26th. You ready?
4439000	4441000	Twinkle Queen.
4441000	4443000	Wait.
4443000	4445000	Are you sure that's not in the Twinkle Star Sprites
4445000	4447000	family? I think it is.
4447000	4449000	Even if it is.
4449000	4451000	It's called Twinkle Queen. Oh no. It's a fighting game.
4451000	4453000	It's a fighting game with chicks.
4453000	4455000	Because we've never seen that before.
4455000	4457000	That was like fun.
4457000	4459000	That's on the 26th. That's not this week.
4459000	4461000	But I just wanted to take a moment to acknowledge Twinkle Queen.
4461000	4463000	It looks like the baseball game is the only big
4463000	4465000	release in Japan this week. Oh no. I lied.
4465000	4467000	On the PSP. Oh awesome.
4467000	4469000	Corpse Party is the name of the game.
4469000	4471000	Corpse Party Blood Covered
4471000	4473000	Repeated Fear is coming out in a
4473000	4475000	regular and limited edition.
4475000	4477000	It looks like some type of survival-ish
4477000	4479000	horror game with a very 8-bit style to it.
4479000	4481000	And there's a chick.
4481000	4483000	They're wearing Sakura uniforms.
4483000	4485000	They're just wearing school girl uniforms.
4485000	4487000	But I guess they're having a Corpse Party?
4487000	4489000	I don't know.
4489000	4491000	Remember last week that
4491000	4493000	Scary Stories game came out.
4493000	4495000	Oh that's right. But that was just like public domain
4495000	4497000	stories on the DS right? Yeah.
4497000	4499000	Kazoku Keikaku
4499000	4501000	comes out on the PSP this week.
4501000	4503000	It looks like the less scary alternative
4503000	4505000	if you want to play.
4505000	4507000	Because these girls are eating and this girl
4507000	4509000	looks like she's farting on another one. I don't know what's happening there.
4509000	4511000	But whatever.
4511000	4513000	So it's family something.
4513000	4515000	Maybe it's the family fucking something.
4515000	4517000	Apparently this is the month of no men
4517000	4519000	in Japan because none of these games
4519000	4521000	have men in them. They're all girls.
4521000	4523000	All the time. As it should be.
4523000	4525000	By the way, from Robocoon
4525000	4527000	in our chat room, I don't know if this is from Wikipedia
4527000	4529000	or what, but giving us the background on
4529000	4531000	Scott Pilgrim vs. the World.
4531000	4533000	The series is about 23-year-old Canadian
4533000	4535000	Scott Pilgrim, a slacker hero
4535000	4537000	and part-time bassist who is living in Toronto
4537000	4539000	and plays bass guitar in the band
4539000	4541000	Sex Bob-omb. He falls
4541000	4543000	in love with American delivery girl
4543000	4545000	Ramona V. Flowers but must defeat her
4545000	4547000	seven evil ex-boyfriends in order to date
4547000	4549000	her. And that's the plot of the movie.
4549000	4551000	That's cute. Oh it does sound cute. By the way
4551000	4553000	Dan, will you defeat my seven exes
4553000	4555000	to date me?
4555000	4557000	That probably wouldn't be very hard. One of the
4557000	4559000	rival bands in the game
4559000	4561000	or in the comics is called
4561000	4563000	Clash at Demonhead. Nice.
4563000	4565000	See, that's how you knew that guy
4565000	4567000	had a boner for video games.
4567000	4569000	People don't know that game unless they're...
4569000	4571000	Sex Bob-omb is awesome too.
4571000	4573000	Clash at Demonhead, that's
4573000	4575000	pretty obscure.
4575000	4577000	That's awesome.
4577000	4579000	The game is actually really, really cool
4579000	4581000	by the way. Why are you having a Squeak, ArcSaga?
4581000	4583000	Because I watched the trailer for this
4583000	4585000	and I totally, totally, totally, totally, totally
4585000	4587000	want this game. What are you talking about?
4587000	4589000	Sonic Colors.
4589000	4591000	Oh wow.
4591000	4593000	What? The theme song
4593000	4595000	is awesome. The theme song is
4595000	4597000	Cheeseballtastic and I love it. But not good.
4597000	4599000	But not in the way that everyone's
4599000	4601000	Super Sonic Racing.
4601000	4603000	But it's Sonic Colors
4603000	4605000	is coming out. Oh dammit. I was trying to
4605000	4607000	play it here in studio. There's a stupid ad on this.
4607000	4609000	Hold on, we'll get through the ad and then we'll...
4609000	4611000	It's not a good ad. It's a stupid ad. Well at any rate, in Europe
4611000	4613000	the game is coming out November 12th
4613000	4615000	and it's
4615000	4617000	actually the Sonic Team
4617000	4619000	head, Izuka Takashi
4619000	4621000	is the
4621000	4623000	big dude
4623000	4625000	who is handling the game
4625000	4627000	and it's pretty and it's really pretty.
4633000	4635000	Happy, happy, happy, happy, happy.
4635000	4637000	Look at this and tell me this is gorgeous.
4637000	4639000	It looks cute.
4645000	4647000	That's hit buffering.
4647000	4649000	It did the same thing for me.
4649000	4651000	Alright, whatever. There you go.
4651000	4653000	Good enough.
4655000	4657000	At any rate,
4657000	4659000	it looks intensely, intensely
4659000	4661000	fun.
4661000	4663000	It reminded me just of how
4663000	4665000	excited I was about Sonic Adventure.
4665000	4667000	And there's no shadow.
4667000	4669000	There's no all these other characters.
4669000	4671000	It's just freakin' Sonic and Tails.
4671000	4673000	It looks cute as hell. I'll give you that.
4673000	4675000	SSG-100 Matt is in our chat
4675000	4677000	room saying Rob's band, speaking
4677000	4679000	of Scott Pilgrim's band and the Rival band.
4679000	4681000	Rob's band is Boom Boom Kitty Fuck.
4681000	4683000	I don't know where that comes from.
4683000	4685000	That was from
4685000	4687000	Jay.
4687000	4689000	Can I call you Boom Boom Kitty Fuck?
4689000	4691000	No, wasn't it?
4691000	4693000	The nickname that he gave his...
4693000	4695000	Boo Boo Kitty Fuck.
4695000	4697000	There's a difference between Boom Boom and Boo Boo.
4697000	4699000	It's crossed over with Boom Boom Dollar.
4699000	4701000	The mashup of the century.
4701000	4703000	That would be a great band name actually.
4703000	4705000	Boom Boom Kitty Fuck. Boom Boom Dollar.
4705000	4707000	That was almost the name of the show actually,
4707000	4709000	but we went with Orange Honch Radio. It was almost
4709000	4711000	Boom Boom Dollar Radio, but sadly.
4711000	4713000	That would have been pretty bad. I actually
4713000	4715000	want to say, no, I'm not fucking with you.
4715000	4717000	That was on the list of names.
4717000	4719000	In the long run, that would have been pretty bad.
4719000	4721000	Finally, wasn't it? We should just do like
4721000	4723000	Orange Lounge.
4723000	4725000	I think it was the idea that we
4725000	4727000	would be lounging around talking
4727000	4729000	and it made sense. I had a
4729000	4731000	migraine our first show.
4731000	4733000	You didn't really start
4733000	4735000	actually 100%
4735000	4737000	being on the show until about the 4th or 5th
4737000	4739000	episode. It's because I had to sleep in the Harry
4739000	4741000	Potter closet.
4741000	4743000	Remember? Yes. I was at the
4743000	4745000	Gay Frat House. Good times.
4745000	4747000	In the Harry Potter closet. True story people.
4747000	4749000	By the way, if you want old episodes of
4749000	4751000	OLR, they're out there.
4751000	4753000	I'm going to warn you though, old OLR
4753000	4755000	is nothing like new OLR.
4755000	4757000	He means out there.
4757000	4759000	It is just wow.
4759000	4761000	Wow have we come a long
4761000	4763000	way in 8 years. We haven't come far
4763000	4765000	but it's still a long way.
4765000	4767000	We've come away.
4767000	4769000	We have evolved but the spirit lives on.
4769000	4771000	If you listen to episode 1,
4771000	4773000	it really is a lot like tonight's
4773000	4775000	show actually where it just
4775000	4777000	isn't really about anything.
4777000	4779000	No, I'm kidding. I'm kidding.
4779000	4781000	It was a lot shorter though. It was. We used to only
4781000	4783000	have a 2 hour show and now we're like 4 hours.
4783000	4785000	I don't know. Anyhow.
4785000	4787000	Rob, more. More?
4787000	4789000	How about more Sonic? I'll tell you more Sonic.
4789000	4791000	It's a hack of Sonic 2.
4791000	4793000	It's called the Dimps edition
4793000	4795000	and it's a ROM hack of Sonic 2
4795000	4797000	that apparently is supposed to make it more
4797000	4799000	like Sonic 4 and there's actually this
4799000	4801000	little trailer that's out there.
4801000	4803000	It got flagged on YouTube.
4803000	4805000	Denied. Oh well.
4805000	4807000	There was a trailer out there on YouTube.
4807000	4809000	It's actually available for download so you can hack the ROM
4809000	4811000	there and what's weird
4811000	4813000	about this though, they're not trying to do it
4813000	4815000	to actually say like, oh hey we're
4815000	4817000	excited for Sonic 4. No no.
4817000	4819000	They're adding the features to try
4819000	4821000	and point out how awful they are.
4823000	4825000	I don't know though. I think there would be a lot of people
4825000	4827000	that would get this to kind of like see the cool
4827000	4829000	new features. I don't know. Sonic 4 didn't look terrible
4829000	4831000	to me. But whatever. This is why I need Sonic
4831000	4833000	colors. It's a very interesting form of protest.
4833000	4835000	Did you miss that a couple shows ago?
4835000	4837000	Matt brought that up. It's the Sonic
4837000	4839000	cat that you get for pre-ordering it.
4839000	4841000	And it actually looks like a... Pre-order!
4841000	4843000	Alright. Don't look at
4843000	4845000	me.
4845000	4847000	Alright. Well speaking of classic games
4847000	4849000	such as Sonic 2 and well really any
4849000	4851000	Sonic in general.
4851000	4853000	We like to take a trip through the
4853000	4855000	gaming vault and find a classic
4855000	4857000	game of the week. The Dark Sakura says hey
4857000	4859000	listen
4859000	4861000	you damn kids. You ought to be
4861000	4863000	playing this game and showing a little
4863000	4865000	respect.
4865000	4867000	It's called the classic video game
4867000	4869000	of the week. Dark Sakura what is
4869000	4871000	tonight's classic video game of the week?
4871000	4873000	Shadow Dancer. Specifically the Mega Drive
4873000	4875000	slash Genesis version.
4875000	4877000	Imagine that. A Genesis game inspired by
4877000	4879000	your Genesis.
4879000	4881000	Well. Um.
4881000	4883000	Although I. Now this
4883000	4885000	is one of the games that I had Dan
4885000	4887000	playing for me last night.
4887000	4889000	I love him.
4889000	4891000	It's just
4891000	4893000	Shinobi.
4893000	4895000	It's actually. Dan this is my second
4895000	4897000	shut up.
4897000	4899000	Anyway. Um.
4899000	4901000	This is
4901000	4903000	this. This is the
4903000	4905000	sequel to Shinobi and it actually is different than the
4905000	4907000	arcade version. The Mega Drive
4907000	4909000	version of Shadow Dancer. The secret of
4909000	4911000	Shinobi. It came out on December 1st
4911000	4913000	1990 in Japan. And
4913000	4915000	the releases came out in North America and Europe afterwards.
4915000	4917000	And it's on the virtual console.
4917000	4919000	Um. And also in the
4919000	4921000	Sega Genesis collection for PS2 and
4921000	4923000	PSP. Dude that dog just ate that guys
4923000	4925000	face. I know right. This one has a dog.
4925000	4927000	What. You have a
4927000	4929000	ninja dog.
4929000	4931000	How freaking cool is that.
4931000	4933000	Anyway. Um. The main guy
4933000	4935000	did not have a name in
4935000	4937000	the um. In the uh.
4937000	4939000	Arcade version. And this one
4939000	4941000	though he's called Hayate.
4941000	4943000	And his dog is
4943000	4945000	and he's actually supposed to be the son of
4945000	4947000	Joe Musashi from
4947000	4949000	the original Shinobi.
4949000	4951000	Um. However
4951000	4953000	that was in the Japanese version. In the US version
4953000	4955000	he's just
4955000	4957000	Joe Musashi. Um. The dog's name is
4957000	4959000	Yamato.
4959000	4961000	Did you know that was the traditional name of Japan?
4961000	4963000	I do not.
4963000	4965000	Now you know. That's why
4965000	4967000	this ship was called Yamato.
4967000	4969000	Anyway. Um.
4969000	4971000	Anyway uh. They're trying to
4971000	4973000	uh. Uh. Avenge
4973000	4975000	this uh. The death of a guy
4975000	4977000	named uh. Kato who
4977000	4979000	was Hayate's mentor.
4979000	4981000	Or Musashi's student depending
4981000	4983000	on which version you're playing.
4983000	4985000	Um. So yeah. Different stages. Different stuff.
4985000	4987000	Um. Instead of looking for
4987000	4989000	time bombs like you did in the uh.
4989000	4991000	coin op one you rescue
4991000	4993000	hostages. And
4993000	4995000	your bonus one instead of being the first
4995000	4997000	person ones are where you fall off
4997000	4999000	of the building and shoot ninjas
4999000	5001000	in the face with shuriken.
5001000	5003000	Isn't that not amazing?
5003000	5005000	And then they also did a
5005000	5007000	Master System version that was out in Europe and Brazil
5007000	5009000	because remember like we said. They love
5009000	5011000	the Master System in Brazil.
5011000	5013000	And um. But this one was
5013000	5015000	actually a direct um. port
5015000	5017000	of the arcade version.
5017000	5019000	And it came out
5019000	5021000	on the computer. For home computer
5021000	5023000	by US Gold.
5023000	5025000	And
5025000	5027000	it's uh.
5027000	5029000	Pretty. Pretty hardcore. And yeah I didn't
5029000	5031000	do the first Kenobi because honestly I like this one better.
5031000	5033000	Cause you have
5033000	5035000	a ninja dog.
5035000	5037000	Tell me.
5037000	5039000	Dance in the other room and play ninja dog.
5039000	5041000	That should just be a video game right there.
5041000	5043000	Ninja dog. Yes.
5043000	5045000	Alright. I want
5045000	5047000	a ninja dog.
5047000	5049000	And then I want my cat to be the big fat
5049000	5051000	geisha.
5053000	5055000	Is that it then? That's it?
5055000	5057000	Yes. Alright. Classic game of the week is
5057000	5059000	Shadow Dancer.
5059000	5061000	I want to say you did like
5061000	5063000	one of the other shinobi games before.
5063000	5065000	I think I actually did shinobi before.
5065000	5067000	You probably did. I want to say I've
5067000	5069000	seen that in the uh. But Shadow Dancer is freaking
5069000	5071000	amazing. Cause you have a ninja dog.
5071000	5073000	I get the ninja
5073000	5075000	dog thing. Dog.
5075000	5077000	Alright. Named Yamato.
5077000	5079000	Well guys we are going to take a break but
5079000	5081000	we will be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio

5123000	5125000	is joining us in the studio tonight. Sweet.
5125000	5127000	As is Misty joining us
5127000	5129000	all the way from the
5129000	5131000	east-ish coast. It's all the east coast
5131000	5133000	to me even though she's really from the midwest
5133000	5135000	but we had that talk a little earlier.
5135000	5137000	But she flew out here to be with us so we really
5137000	5139000	appreciate it. And we have tacos. Yes.
5139000	5141000	And we are all eating Mystique's tacos right now
5141000	5143000	and they're delicious I must say.
5143000	5145000	It's great. So uh
5145000	5147000	needs more salt though. No I'm kidding I'm kidding.
5147000	5149000	Alright cause they're low sodium
5149000	5151000	get it? Alright anyway. Uh
5151000	5153000	no actually they were really good. I
5153000	5155000	would never have guessed that they were any type
5155000	5157000	of special diet tacos.
5157000	5159000	Anyhow um
5159000	5161000	I'm kind of tired today you guys and I
5161000	5163000	apologize I'm really tired but
5163000	5165000	um last night I actually
5165000	5167000	I did something I've been wanting to do
5167000	5169000	for like 10 years and
5169000	5171000	never have had the opportunity to
5171000	5173000	until last night. And
5173000	5175000	um that was I went and saw
5175000	5177000	Showgirls in a theater.
5177000	5179000	It was
5179000	5181000	Mystique is laughing.
5181000	5183000	Mystique is just like they're bellowing.
5183000	5185000	No here's the thing. Wait wait Mystique Mystique
5185000	5187000	where's Mystique? Mystique get in here for a minute
5187000	5189000	cause I have to tell you about this. Okay
5189000	5191000	get Mystique a mic.
5191000	5193000	Get in here Mystique. Mystique.
5193000	5195000	You actually paid to see Showgirls?
5195000	5197000	Yes I paid. Well actually no I got
5197000	5199000	Alan to pay. Alan paid
5199000	5201000	15
5201000	5203000	15 dollars a ticket. No this isn't in
5203000	5205000	there. Okay so we're at the Castro Theater
5205000	5209000	right? Right in the heart
5209000	5211000	of you know what okay? And here's
5211000	5213000	the thing it was hosted by a
5213000	5215000	drag queen named Peaches Christ
5215000	5217000	Okay
5217000	5219000	that's officially awesome. And
5219000	5221000	uh she's been doing this for years this thing
5221000	5223000	she calls like midnight mass although for whatever
5223000	5225000	reason it was 8pm this year. She hosted
5225000	5227000	um uh Showgirls
5227000	5229000	and I you know I saw the movie like
5229000	5231000	not long after it came out and I was like
5231000	5233000	boobies every
5233000	5235000	boobies everywhere boobies
5235000	5237000	you saw that movie when it came out
5237000	5239000	not funny. Which is funny cause you know
5239000	5241000	I'm gay and all but I just boobies are
5241000	5243000	great like. And Rob made me watch it. Yeah why is it with
5243000	5245000	gay guys and boobs? I've talked to a lot of gay guys
5245000	5247000	they like boobs. Um we like to call them
5247000	5249000	fun bags cause
5249000	5251000	that's what they are.
5251000	5253000	I call mine jubbles.
5253000	5255000	Do you name your boobs?
5255000	5257000	They're just jubbles. Jubbles?
5257000	5259000	They're my jubbles. But there's two of them right?
5259000	5261000	Unless you don't have a uni-boob do you?
5261000	5263000	No they're the twins but I just call them my jubbles.
5263000	5265000	Oh okay I see. Alright that works
5265000	5267000	that works. Do you name your boobies?
5267000	5269000	Darth sakura?
5269000	5271000	Uh it's uh one's don't touch me there
5271000	5273000	and two is stop it.
5275000	5277000	Lies. Alright um
5277000	5279000	I call them lefty and righty.
5279000	5281000	You would. Shut up.
5281000	5283000	I had a girlfriend uh yes
5283000	5285000	believe it or not when I was like 16.
5285000	5287000	See I'm not surprised about that either. I had a girlfriend
5287000	5289000	and her name was Chuck. No no
5289000	5291000	shut up.
5291000	5293000	Her she named her boobies
5293000	5295000	and her boobies names get this
5295000	5297000	I'm not even I am not making this up
5297000	5299000	were Pebbles and Bam Bam.
5299000	5301000	Wow.
5301000	5303000	How is their names?
5303000	5305000	Wow.
5305000	5307000	Now we know why Rob is gay.
5307000	5309000	You know what
5309000	5311000	if dudes can name their junk
5311000	5313000	women can name their tits.
5313000	5315000	That's
5315000	5317000	very true. It's a free country.
5317000	5319000	Mine are just my
5319000	5321000	boobs.
5321000	5323000	The girls. Misty?
5323000	5325000	I'm not even gonna ask. She'll
5325000	5327000	throw that bottle of Mountain Dew at me. Alright
5327000	5329000	uh let's see
5329000	5331000	Now why would I waste mine and do like that?
5331000	5333000	Frisbee says kibbles and bits.
5337000	5339000	I want to know great
5339000	5341000	boob names. Like I know that has nothing to
5341000	5343000	do with gaming but I don't care.
5343000	5345000	I need to know good boob names.
5345000	5347000	So Dia says hers are named.
5347000	5349000	Wait what are uh
5349000	5351000	She's not saying what they are. Oh bummer.
5351000	5353000	Come on. You open that bag.
5353000	5355000	Now let the cat out.
5355000	5357000	Alright. Tiger Claw
5357000	5359000	says you can just call them bean bags because you know you
5359000	5361000	want to sleep on top of them. That actually is one
5361000	5363000	really good use of boobies. Like you know
5363000	5365000	sometimes when you're watching a movie and cuddling
5365000	5367000	with the fag hag there's you know boobies
5367000	5369000	that you can kind of you know rest your weary
5369000	5371000	head on. So there you go.
5371000	5373000	I think boobs are great. They are.
5373000	5375000	I think that they actually sell boob pillows in Japan.
5375000	5377000	And wrist rest
5377000	5379000	for your mouth so they are boobies.
5379000	5381000	Oh I've seen the hand pillows.
5381000	5383000	But they also sell laps that are like
5383000	5385000	maids. Maids laps.
5385000	5387000	For people
5387000	5389000	to lean on and sleep.
5389000	5391000	Interesting. It's that whole
5391000	5393000	mole thing you know. Alright.
5393000	5395000	Fair enough. Alright anyhow
5395000	5397000	I don't know what that had to do with games but boy
5397000	5399000	wasn't it fun. Alright. Man is a weird
5399000	5401000	place.
5401000	5403000	Let's see. Okay this is great.
5403000	5405000	She said my left one is named
5405000	5407000	Righty and the right one is named Lefty so the guy
5407000	5409000	doesn't get confused.
5409000	5411000	SSJ100 Matt says in chat
5411000	5413000	see see see the religious
5413000	5415000	fanatics and gays can both agree
5415000	5417000	on the fact that boobs are fun.
5417000	5419000	You know what we do you know
5419000	5421000	all this propping debate. I can see your dirty
5421000	5423000	pillows.
5423000	5425000	What? Didn't you see
5425000	5427000	Carrie? Do not want. Oh.
5427000	5429000	Years ago. Years ago.
5429000	5431000	They're all gonna laugh at you. Alright.
5431000	5433000	No. They're all gonna
5433000	5435000	laugh at you. Let's
5435000	5437000	derail the show further shall we?
5437000	5439000	And how. Alright let's get into Twitter topics.
5439000	5441000	Let's let the listeners control
5441000	5443000	the show with topics for a little bit.
5443000	5445000	Sweet.
5445000	5447000	Taco.
5447000	5449000	You can't run out to get a taco while we're trying to do
5449000	5451000	Twitter topics. She ran out to get a taco.
5451000	5453000	This is not
5453000	5455000	taco topics. It's Twitter topics.
5455000	5457000	Taco time.
5457000	5459000	Let's go Twitter topics. Alright.
5459000	5461000	You ready Dan? I'm ready. There's a game
5461000	5463000	Robocoon gets our first taco
5463000	5465000	topic tonight. Saying that there is
5465000	5467000	a game called Privates
5467000	5469000	that is now out on the PC.
5469000	5471000	This is the sex game.
5471000	5473000	Yes this is the one
5473000	5475000	where like I think you play these
5475000	5477000	little sperm-y condom looking guys
5477000	5479000	and yeah
5479000	5481000	you have a Windows computer
5481000	5483000	and
5483000	5485000	you can download this game now and
5485000	5487000	I guess it's a game that teaches you about
5487000	5489000	sex. Does it work with Kinect?
5489000	5491000	No it's a PC game.
5491000	5493000	For now.
5493000	5495000	You never know.
5495000	5497000	Let's see TigerClaw
5497000	5499000	305 sends us lots and lots
5499000	5501000	of links tonight. We're going to do a
5501000	5503000	couple of these here. First off
5503000	5505000	I think this is actually
5505000	5507000	really cool. All joking and laughing and boob
5507000	5509000	talk aside this is actually a really great story here.
5509000	5511000	The Kinect is going to be able to
5511000	5513000	recognize sign language. As long
5513000	5515000	as you're not sitting on the couch.
5515000	5517000	The
5517000	5519000	Kinect will actually recognize
5519000	5521000	American Sign Language and
5521000	5523000	it's due to a patent I guess that's out there.
5523000	5525000	If you are proficient in sign
5525000	5527000	language you can actually get the
5527000	5529000	Xbox 360 to recognize
5529000	5531000	the letters that you're doing in sign.
5531000	5533000	That's a great way to learn too.
5533000	5535000	Apparently though even if you don't know ASL
5535000	5537000	you somehow will be able to
5537000	5539000	lip read. That's pretty specific
5539000	5541000	for the Kinect. That's also kind of scary
5541000	5543000	if you think about it. They're saying
5543000	5545000	that instead of voice chat you may be
5545000	5547000	able to actually sign.
5547000	5549000	You need to learn how to start signing all that
5549000	5551000	foul language you hear on Xbox Live because
5551000	5553000	that's what this will be useful for.
5553000	5555000	I know how to sign.
5555000	5557000	I know how to say bitch in sign language.
5557000	5559000	I bet you do.
5559000	5561000	I'm sure we know the same
5561000	5563000	one Dan. This is less awesome
5563000	5565000	but this is something that TigerClaw sends.
5565000	5567000	It must be reported on. It is news.
5567000	5569000	Billy Mitchell has taken back the
5569000	5571000	Donkey Kong record.
5571000	5573000	It happened on August 7th 2010.
5573000	5575000	He reclaimed Donkey Kong
5575000	5577000	and Donkey Kong Jr.
5577000	5579000	Billy Mitchell is laying the smackdown.
5579000	5581000	That's right. He is not to be
5581000	5583000	fucked with. There it is.
5583000	5585000	He's like Steve Weeby sucks.
5585000	5587000	Whatever his name is. Hank Chien.
5587000	5589000	The dentist. Goodbye.
5589000	5591000	That's right. Off with you.
5591000	5593000	It happened at Boomers Grand Prix Arcade
5593000	5595000	in Florida verified
5595000	5597000	live by Twin Galaxies
5597000	5599000	Refs. That's it.
5599000	5601000	2 hours and 42 minutes
5601000	5603000	for Donkey Kong. 3 hours and 58 minutes
5603000	5605000	for Donkey Kong Jr.
5605000	5607000	I think I like this. He
5607000	5609000	stopped right after he
5609000	5611000	got past Hank Chien's score
5611000	5613000	and Mitchell said
5613000	5615000	quote, some say I'm being cocky.
5615000	5617000	Some say I'm being lazy.
5617000	5619000	I say I'm being Billy Mitchell.
5619000	5621000	Well because he wants
5621000	5623000	to have that record broken again.
5623000	5625000	He wants to be
5625000	5627000	able to keep one upping it because he really
5627000	5629000	does know that he is
5629000	5631000	that much better than everybody else
5631000	5633000	at Donkey Kong.
5633000	5635000	You know whether
5635000	5637000	you love Mitchell or
5637000	5639000	you hate him and you know you hate him. Everybody hates
5639000	5641000	Billy Mitchell. The guy
5641000	5643000	you know is the best in
5643000	5645000	the world at that game.
5647000	5649000	SSG100Matt sends us a tweet
5649000	5651000	about NHL 11
5651000	5653000	because we love sports games here at OLR.
5653000	5655000	There's nothing we love more than sports games.
5655000	5657000	And how?
5657000	5659000	If I'm going to play a sports game, why are there all these
5659000	5661000	giggling women in the other room?
5661000	5663000	Mystique's on the phone with our friend Beanie and Beanie said they had
5663000	5665000	tacos too.
5665000	5667000	Is it Taco Day?
5667000	5669000	The people in front of us at the supermarket
5669000	5671000	were buying the ingredients were buying the stuff to make
5671000	5673000	Mexican food.
5673000	5675000	Did I miss the memo? I was not aware it was
5675000	5677000	Taco Day. I thought Taco Day was
5677000	5679000	Tuesday.
5679000	5681000	You know who started that branding?
5681000	5683000	Me. Did you? I started Taco Tuesday.
5683000	5685000	I don't know.
5685000	5687000	That was a Del Taco thing.
5687000	5689000	I invented the internet.
5689000	5691000	Can I talk about NHL 11?
5691000	5693000	Yes.
5693000	5695000	There is download content.
5695000	5697000	It's all priced between 80 and 160
5697000	5699000	Microsoft points.
5699000	5701000	They're like player boosts where you can
5701000	5703000	actually give yourself high boosts
5703000	5705000	of 5 and 1 and 3 and so forth.
5705000	5707000	Get this.
5707000	5709000	156 different pieces
5709000	5711000	of download content.
5711000	5713000	Because EA doesn't have enough money.
5713000	5715000	Well they needed to
5715000	5717000	buy a soul.
5717000	5719000	Apparently.
5719000	5721000	What would EA do with a soul but
5721000	5723000	sell it? I don't know. That's kind of screwed up
5723000	5725000	I guess. For more Madden rights.
5725000	5727000	Because really you're paying to basically make your characters
5727000	5729000	better.
5729000	5731000	Learn to play.
5731000	5733000	SSG100 Matt
5733000	5735000	in our chat says hockey is being derailed
5735000	5737000	for tacos. Oh the humanity.
5737000	5739000	Tacos.
5739000	5741000	Frisbee gets kudos
5741000	5743000	for saying Billy Mitchell. I'm number one
5743000	5745000	at making sauce.
5745000	5747000	Tacos own hockey.
5747000	5749000	I'm saucy.
5749000	5751000	For real he sells
5751000	5753000	sauce on the internet.
5753000	5755000	I love the idea of a new sport
5755000	5757000	called Hocko's or Taki.
5757000	5759000	Or Taki.
5759000	5761000	And it would be hockey
5761000	5763000	played with tacos.
5763000	5765000	But they have to be like you know steal tacos.
5765000	5767000	Yeah. Alright. Steal tacos.
5767000	5769000	Blades of tacos.
5769000	5771000	Blades of tacos.
5771000	5773000	What's DS Master
5773000	5775000	doing allowed in the chat? They skate
5775000	5777000	on tacos.
5777000	5779000	Wow.
5779000	5781000	That would get messy.
5781000	5783000	But that would be fun.
5783000	5785000	I just can't DS Master.
5785000	5787000	Have fun. Alright.
5787000	5789000	Moving on. Let's see. What the hell is DS Master?
5789000	5791000	Lame. Some guy.
5791000	5793000	AK Ripper and USOC
5793000	5795000	says this week's episode
5795000	5797000	is awesome. Indeed.
5797000	5799000	This is also AK Ripper's
5799000	5801000	first time listening to Oella. No I'm kidding.
5801000	5803000	Alright. He calls in a lot.
5803000	5805000	Blue Swim sends us some
5805000	5807000	tweets. I'm just getting into
5807000	5809000	Dreamcast import gaming.
5809000	5811000	Boy you're about
5811000	5813000	15 years late now. I'm kidding. You want
5813000	5815000	Blue Stinger. What DC
5815000	5817000	games not already out in the US
5817000	5819000	somehow are worth importing.
5819000	5821000	The only Dreamcast imports I've got are
5821000	5823000	Fire Pro Wrestling D and Giant
5823000	5825000	Gram 2000. Which means he spent
5825000	5827000	8 bucks.
5827000	5829000	He probably downloaded them off the
5829000	5831000	inner tubes. Actually the Japanese version of
5831000	5833000	Blue Stinger is better than the US one.
5833000	5835000	The Japanese version of Blue Stinger is much better
5835000	5837000	than the US one. What about
5837000	5839000	isn't it the Japanese? No that was on the
5839000	5841000	Saturn. I was thinking Symphony of the Night but that's
5841000	5843000	on the Saturn. Yeah that's on the Saturn. What other
5843000	5845000	import awesome Dreamcast games are there?
5845000	5847000	Hold on. There's yeah.
5847000	5849000	Dark Soccer is going to the vault.
5849000	5851000	There's almost too many to go into.
5851000	5853000	Well while Dark Soccer runs to the vault
5853000	5855000	I will take other tweets.
5855000	5857000	She's going to come back with a bunch of terrible suggestions.
5857000	5859000	Spazinator sends us a tweet.
5859000	5861000	Apparently it's a leaked video
5861000	5863000	of the Castlevania Lords of Shadow Game.
5863000	5865000	Oh ha ha ha. He tried to
5865000	5867000	Rickroll us but I had it on mute.
5867000	5869000	That's why I usually don't
5869000	5871000	click on YouTube links but he cleverly
5871000	5873000	disguised it behind a bit.
5873000	5875000	Kick him.
5875000	5877000	I can't kick somebody off Twitter. If I could I would
5877000	5879000	for that. No I would just
5879000	5881000	kick him. I think everything
5881000	5883000	in this box came out in the US.
5883000	5885000	And
5885000	5887000	why do we have two copies of Capcom vs
5887000	5889000	SNK? Because
5889000	5891000	we're that awesome. No one
5891000	5893000	of them's the pro edition.
5893000	5895000	I gave him the best kick I could over Twitter.
5895000	5897000	I just sent him a tweet that said THWACK.
5897000	5899000	Boot to the head.
5899000	5901000	Alright let's see.
5901000	5903000	DJ Blazekin. Ever wonder what it would
5903000	5905000	be like to have DJ Hero on the NES?
5905000	5907000	No.
5907000	5909000	Neither has anybody
5909000	5911000	else. Well apparently
5911000	5913000	there is actually out there in the world
5913000	5915000	an 8 bit version of DJ Hero.
5915000	5917000	This is the same guy. He downgraded
5917000	5919000	some other games on the NES too. Here it is
5919000	5921000	folks.
5921000	5923000	These videos are always so bad
5923000	5925000	it gives me cancer.
5931000	5933000	What song is this?
5933000	5935000	Hangin' Tough.
5935000	5937000	What song is this?
5937000	5939000	Oh it's
5939000	5941000	Queen.
5945000	5947000	This game
5947000	5949000	sucks bad. Nobody bought
5949000	5951000	it.
5951000	5953000	You don't buy it Dan.
5953000	5955000	It's a hack. No I'm just talking about
5955000	5957000	DJ Hero.
5957000	5959000	You have no idea how hard I tried to sell
5959000	5961000	that game. You know what made it sell?
5961000	5963000	When it went down to like 80% off
5963000	5965000	it sold like crazy and now it's a hit.
5965000	5967000	People bought it. Anyhow.
5967000	5969000	One more tweet. Can I do one more tweet?
5969000	5971000	By the way I did go through the box
5971000	5973000	and I think everything that we have in the box
5973000	5975000	came out in the US. But
5975000	5977000	P.O.P.O. Da. I really like that game.
5977000	5979000	Hide with Thunder.
5979000	5981000	Someone imports Dan you dork.
5981000	5983000	Well you can't say it and give Blue Swim at least
5983000	5985000	one or two suggestions.
5985000	5987000	Let's see.
5987000	5989000	Orange Rite.
5989000	5991000	Because it almost makes it sound like Orange
5991000	5993000	L.R. is
5993000	5995000	right or something like that. Orange Rite
5995000	5997000	says his tweet saying Konami is
5997000	5999000	going to have a DDR party at Royal Tea
5999000	6001000	Cafe to celebrate their first DDR
6001000	6003000	for the PS3. Naoki will be
6003000	6005000	there live DJing. I did hear
6005000	6007000	about this actually. Too far
6007000	6009000	away or I would want to go. Yeah it's in Culver City
6009000	6011000	California which is in SoCal. It's a little
6011000	6013000	far especially for a weeknight because it's on August
6013000	6015000	12th which is like this week.
6015000	6017000	But hey if we have folks in the area
6017000	6019000	by all means go. I'm going to try to send
6019000	6021000	DJ Tyrant. He's in SoCal
6021000	6023000	and he's done some freelancing for the website so I'll
6023000	6025000	see if he can go and like cover this
6025000	6027000	for us. We don't have jobs we're going.
6027000	6029000	No I'm just kidding.
6029000	6031000	We ain't got no money.
6033000	6035000	Oh I know you could use the show
6035000	6037000	funds. Oh wait
6037000	6039000	we don't have show funds.
6039000	6041000	I've been too poor to donate.
6041000	6043000	We had show funds once.
6043000	6045000	Now we have a soundboard.
6045000	6047000	And I got to go to California Extreme
6047000	6049000	two years ago. Alright. Tiger Claw
6049000	6051000	saying I missed one of his tweets. I'm sorry Tiger Claw
6051000	6053000	there's a two tweet maximum. Too bad.
6053000	6055000	How does it feel?
6055000	6057000	Huh? Huh? Nah I
6057000	6059000	I appreciate what Tiger Claw does for the show
6059000	6061000	I do but I have to spread. It's not the
6061000	6063000	Tiger Claw segment. It's the Twitter Claw
6063000	6065000	Twitter Claw segment. I actually
6065000	6067000	said the Twitter Claw segment.
6067000	6069000	Shit. Alright.
6069000	6071000	Totally missed my point.
6071000	6073000	Tiger Claw contingency. Alright.
6073000	6075000	How about more news shall we?
6075000	6077000	And how? How about it?
6077000	6079000	This is like freaky fucking
6079000	6081000	scary to me. This reminds me of a
6081000	6083000	scene in the Clockwork Orange and I don't like it.
6083000	6085000	Although I love the name
6085000	6087000	of the company who made this because their name
6087000	6089000	is Waterloo Labs.
6089000	6091000	Do you get it?
6095000	6097000	Hold on I have to sorry for the dead air but I have to
6097000	6099000	bring this up like I need I need music
6099000	6101000	if I'm going to report on a story from Waterloo
6101000	6103000	Labs here. This is mandatory
6103000	6105000	that I have a story here.
6117000	6119000	Alright no seriously Waterloo
6119000	6121000	Labs they have developed
6121000	6123000	an electrode system that actually
6123000	6125000	measures your eye movement and
6125000	6127000	uses it to control
6127000	6129000	Super Mario Brothers.
6129000	6131000	That's right. So look at this dude
6131000	6133000	here. He actually has his eyes. Actually
6133000	6135000	I'll stop the Abba here for a minute and the listeners
6135000	6137000	rejoice. And you can actually watch
6137000	6139000	this guy in this little video here.
6143000	6145000	Alright blah blah blah blah blah.
6145000	6147000	Looks like they're in like a
6147000	6149000	garage. Not like a
6149000	6151000	garage like at your house.
6151000	6153000	It's like when we were at the OLR
6153000	6155000	studio. We are at the
6155000	6157000	OLR studio. And it's just a
6157000	6159000	spare bedroom.
6159000	6161000	Alright.
6161000	6163000	It looks like these guys are in like
6163000	6165000	their garage. It looks like they're in like a mechanics
6165000	6167000	garage. It's hilarious. I don't want to see these
6167000	6169000	guys like just talk about their stupid device.
6169000	6171000	There we go. There's the guy playing. Oh my god
6171000	6173000	he actually looks up to jump.
6173000	6175000	And the guy does jump.
6175000	6177000	That is and they
6177000	6179000	kind of move their head a little bit though. That's kind of
6179000	6181000	cheating. I bet he can't get to the line in this world.
6181000	6183000	I'd like to see him run through 8-1
6183000	6185000	always running like that.
6185000	6187000	That is freaky to me.
6187000	6189000	Oh see look at him die.
6189000	6191000	Boo.
6191000	6193000	Now Rob though you know they've had this before.
6193000	6195000	What? The Atari Mindlink.
6195000	6197000	Really? Yeah Atari in the
6197000	6199000	80's marketed a controller
6199000	6201000	that was going to play by your brainwaves.
6201000	6203000	But it actually played by the way that you
6203000	6205000	moved your head.
6205000	6207000	Like your forehead? Yeah.
6207000	6209000	It worked on your eyebrow muscles.
6209000	6211000	Snake oil. Exactly. Never released.
6211000	6213000	It was a
6213000	6215000	famous vaporware.
6215000	6217000	I don't think Waterloo Labs
6217000	6219000	actually plans to do anything with this. Waterloo.
6219000	6221000	I know right. Napoleon did
6221000	6223000	surrender. Napoleon.
6223000	6225000	Whatever
6225000	6227000	it made for a great YouTube and got their little
6227000	6229000	lab all over blogs and on
6229000	6231000	our show so congrats. There you go.
6231000	6233000	This website though that I
6233000	6235000	tried to find the picture on it actually
6235000	6237000	shows some Atari wireless
6237000	6239000	controllers that have these big antennas and
6239000	6241000	this thing and then an orthopedic shoe and it's
6241000	6243000	labeled which one is the orthopedic shoe.
6243000	6245000	It looks like
6245000	6247000	somebody in our chat room MOTC
6247000	6249000	I don't know if that's short for something. Sorry.
6249000	6251000	Is like going crazy trying to get the DDR
6251000	6253000	event information.
6253000	6255000	So if you're going I want a phone call next
6255000	6257000	week dude.
6257000	6259000	And by the way Orange Right actually
6259000	6261000	joined our chat room and actually changed the name to
6261000	6263000	Orange LR is right. So there we go.
6263000	6265000	Alright. Thank you very much.
6265000	6267000	Appreciate it. Well done sir. Well done.
6267000	6269000	And Tiger Claw like the
6269000	6271000	Google Ninja he is right there with the Wikipedia
6271000	6273000	article to the Atari
6273000	6275000	mind link. I want to see a picture
6275000	6277000	of this thing and see if it was scary looking.
6277000	6279000	I posted one in the chat room.
6279000	6281000	Go to the Atari History Museum. Hold on. Hold on.
6281000	6283000	The link is on the wiki page. Hold on.
6283000	6285000	I'm on it. I'm on it. I'm on it.
6285000	6287000	Let's see.
6289000	6291000	Oh I see it. There it is.
6291000	6293000	That looks dumb.
6293000	6295000	It was. That made for
6295000	6297000	great. It never worked.
6297000	6299000	I guess there was a game called Mind Maze.
6299000	6301000	Also that dude is wearing loafers with
6301000	6303000	no socks.
6303000	6305000	It was the 80's.
6305000	6307000	MOTC has finals that night and can't
6307000	6309000	attend the DDR party.
6309000	6311000	Fire. Blow them off.
6311000	6313000	Skip school. No I'm kidding.
6313000	6315000	I'm kidding. I'm kidding.
6315000	6317000	Dark Sakura.
6317000	6319000	What do you have for us? Stuff.
6319000	6321000	Actually this is something that perhaps
6321000	6323000	Dan might be interested in.
6323000	6325000	Maybe. Maybe.
6325000	6327000	Well actually it's
6327000	6329000	he couldn't do anything with it because it's only
6329000	6331000	for Europe.
6331000	6333000	The European special editions
6333000	6335000	have
6335000	6337000	two special editions actually.
6337000	6339000	There's the signature addiction
6339000	6341000	that's like the US collector's edition.
6341000	6343000	It has a metal case.
6343000	6345000	A miniature SLS AMG
6345000	6347000	It comes with a toy car.
6347000	6349000	Model car.
6349000	6351000	It comes with a V6 engine.
6351000	6353000	A USB flash drive.
6353000	6355000	A wallet.
6355000	6357000	And an entry into a contest to win a Mercedes-Benz.
6357000	6359000	And vouchers for 11 download content
6359000	6361000	vehicles. A key fob.
6361000	6363000	An art book. A driving strategy
6363000	6365000	mini magazine.
6365000	6367000	And it's going to be
6367000	6369000	$179.99.
6369000	6371000	There's another special edition too.
6371000	6373000	It's all that stuff. It comes
6373000	6375000	to the trunk of a Z06 Corvette
6375000	6377000	and it costs $70,000.
6377000	6379000	And then
6379000	6381000	there's another one
6381000	6383000	if you don't have as much money which is $79.99
6383000	6385000	Euro.
6385000	6387000	It's the collector's edition that has a slip
6387000	6389000	cover.
6389000	6391000	Some art cards.
6391000	6393000	The download content
6393000	6395000	vouchers and the driving magazines
6395000	6397000	that came with the other version.
6397000	6399000	So you can decide
6399000	6401000	if you want to
6401000	6403000	have the cool version
6403000	6405000	or the oh my god can I win the Mercedes
6405000	6407000	version. Well let's keep in mind that's Euro.
6407000	6409000	So that's like what a buck and a half
6409000	6411000	a buck seventy five per Euro.
6411000	6413000	Or you could just buy the god damn
6413000	6415000	game by itself and be happy with it.
6415000	6417000	I'll do the conversion right now.
6417000	6419000	I want to get the US collector's edition
6419000	6421000	but I don't think I'm going to spring for it. What's in the US
6421000	6423000	collector's edition?
6423000	6425000	It comes with a toy car.
6425000	6427000	Bunch of DLC. Art book.
6427000	6429000	A book.
6429000	6431000	Soundtrack. Just all kinds of
6431000	6433000	stuff. And I like Gran Turismo
6433000	6435000	and after I'm like yeah
6435000	6437000	yeah I'll do that. And I'm like what it's
6437000	6439000	like 150 bucks?
6439000	6441000	Jesus no.
6441000	6443000	Alright going to another game
6443000	6445000	that's coming out later this year here in the US
6445000	6447000	and the UK. I think it's in the UK
6447000	6449000	this year.
6449000	6451000	240 bucks.
6451000	6453000	Got some money.
6453000	6455000	Hey a new mode in
6455000	6457000	GoldenEye that kind of
6457000	6459000	throws you back to an old mode. Here's the thing
6459000	6461000	there used to be a mode if you remember in GoldenEye
6461000	6463000	on the N64 it was called DK
6463000	6465000	mode. And that was the mode where you would all
6465000	6467000	have the giant heads.
6467000	6469000	It made all the enemies
6469000	6471000	and people in the game have these gigantic
6471000	6473000	heads and they all had
6473000	6475000	what they would call the proportions of Donkey
6475000	6477000	Kong because at that time Rare
6477000	6479000	was making of course this game and they were making
6479000	6481000	the Donkey Kong games on Super Nintendo right?
6481000	6483000	So is Donkey Kong mode coming back?
6483000	6485000	No of course not stupid
6485000	6487000	because Activision has the rights now and they
6487000	6489000	don't own the rights to Donkey Kong.
6489000	6491000	So it's not coming back. But
6491000	6493000	what they did and this is clever
6493000	6495000	they've decided to do a instead of big
6495000	6497000	heads they now have
6497000	6499000	big hands.
6499000	6501000	That's right there's a big hands
6501000	6503000	mode that can be activated in multi
6503000	6505000	players and you get big hands
6505000	6507000	and this is it. You can only melee
6507000	6509000	people so it is bitch slap mode basically.
6509000	6511000	You can only bitch slap the other players
6511000	6513000	with your giant hands.
6513000	6515000	That is what it is.
6515000	6517000	Awesome.
6517000	6519000	There also by the way is a mode
6519000	6521000	that makes everybody tiny that I believe was in the
6521000	6523000	old game as well. There's a knick knack mode
6523000	6525000	is what it's called. Am I alone in being
6525000	6527000	a lot less interested in that game when
6527000	6529000	they're like yeah we're going to redo GoldenEye.
6529000	6531000	Yay. Oh we're
6531000	6533000	going to take Pierce Brosnan out and we're going to put
6533000	6535000	Daniel Craig in. Oh yeah that's
6535000	6537000	that's
6537000	6539000	interesting. That's not a big deal. Whatever.
6539000	6541000	You see it was those Bond movies
6541000	6543000	were fine. The new ones were fine. They're awesome.
6543000	6545000	But GoldenEye is
6545000	6547000	Brosnan's movie. I
6547000	6549000	know it's weird but you know
6549000	6551000	the multiplayer one is fun.
6551000	6553000	I played it at E3
6553000	6555000	and I'll just say it doesn't even matter. Brosnan's a whore
6555000	6557000	for money. It's all about Odd
6557000	6559000	Job anyway because he throws the hat
6559000	6561000	and it's awesome.
6561000	6563000	There's a shoe honestly. Honestly.
6563000	6565000	You fight like a woman.
6565000	6567000	Frisbee in our chat room is a little upset saying you
6567000	6569000	can't claim ownership on big heads
6569000	6571000	and hands etc.
6571000	6573000	Maybe it was just they just didn't want to go there.
6573000	6575000	It's too
6575000	6577000	too close or something. The conglomerate
6577000	6579000	that owns what's left of Midway should sue.
6579000	6581000	Except it was a rare game.
6581000	6583000	Not Midway. Right but Midway
6583000	6585000	the big heads thing came along in NBA
6585000	6587000	Jam.
6587000	6589000	Back to NBA Jam again.
6589000	6591000	Shut up Dan.
6591000	6593000	Shut up Dan.
6593000	6595000	Let's do another news story. Well
6595000	6597000	for those who are looking forward to Pokemon Black
6597000	6599000	and White that haven't already. Hey Dan here you go.
6599000	6601000	And how?
6601000	6603000	That haven't already imported it.
6603000	6605000	Sorry.
6605000	6607000	You um
6607000	6609000	when you play through it the first time
6609000	6611000	until you beat it you can only
6611000	6613000	use the new Pokemon.
6613000	6615000	You don't get the old Pokemons.
6615000	6617000	No Pika.
6617000	6619000	Pika. Not until you beat the game.
6619000	6621000	Dan you can get some Pika.
6621000	6623000	Look I understand why they're fighting
6623000	6625000	like there's a lot of fucking Pokemon
6625000	6627000	at this point right like how many Pokemon are there now
6627000	6629000	like 700 fucking Pokemon or something like
6629000	6631000	it's just it's insane and they're all
6631000	6633000	starting to be like parodies of each other.
6633000	6635000	I would under I would actually sympathize
6635000	6637000	with Nintendo if they wanted to say hey look
6637000	6639000	new game, new system
6639000	6641000	or actually did they have another
6641000	6643000	DS? Whatever. New way of playing, new game
6643000	6645000	new Pokemon.
6645000	6647000	Stop asking for the old shit. I still want an
6647000	6649000	actual Pokemon MMO. But it's
6649000	6651000	weird that they kind of put
6651000	6653000	the Pokemon in there anyway at the end but I guess it's a
6653000	6655000	reward to beat the game. I guess.
6655000	6657000	There you go. I still want a Pokemon MMO
6657000	6659000	I would play that. Every time there's a
6659000	6661000	Pokemon story on this show somebody says
6661000	6663000	why don't they make this an MMO already?
6663000	6665000	That's a very good question. Because a Pokemon Momo would work.
6665000	6667000	A Pokemon Momo?
6667000	6669000	Is that like a
6669000	6671000	Moomoo? Momo.
6671000	6673000	A Pokemon MMO would be
6673000	6675000	great. It would be. But it would be weird
6675000	6677000	because Nintendo in their
6677000	6679000	mission to protect children across the
6679000	6681000	world with friends codes how in the hell would an
6681000	6683000	MMO work? And they keep it
6683000	6685000	like kid friendly quote unquote.
6685000	6687000	Would it be like the Disney game where you can only
6687000	6689000	say certain phrases to people?
6689000	6691000	That would have to be what would happen.
6691000	6693000	That ain't my problem. I just think that a Pokemon MMO
6693000	6695000	would work. Oh well okay.
6695000	6697000	Screw the kids. That's right. Screw the
6697000	6699000	kids. That's right Misty.
6699000	6701000	I would play the Pokemon MMO
6701000	6703000	while I ate my Nintendo cereal system
6703000	6705000	in my Nintendo pajamas.
6705000	6707000	It'd be awesome.
6707000	6709000	Amen.
6709000	6711000	This is awesome. It's not Pokemon
6711000	6713000	but it's almost as awesome. Torchlight
6713000	6715000	is coming. Torchlight 2
6715000	6717000	there's a sequel to the game Torchlight
6717000	6719000	which if you haven't played honestly they've had this game
6719000	6721000	on sale on
6721000	6723000	Steam I don't know how many times
6723000	6725000	and if you haven't picked it up by now you're a fool
6725000	6727000	because this game is great. If you like
6727000	6729000	I have a broken computer. I suppose
6729000	6731000	that's an acceptable excuse. And you're a fool.
6731000	6733000	But Diablo 2.
6733000	6735000	Who doesn't like Diablo Diablo 2? If you like those
6735000	6737000	games you're going to love Torchlight because it's basically half the
6737000	6739000	same team. But they made this game Torchlight
6739000	6741000	and they have announced that they are going to be doing a
6741000	6743000	sequel. It's going to be in 2011.
6743000	6745000	Multiplayer support.
6745000	6747000	Yay! Because that's what the first game really
6747000	6749000	badly needed. Torchlight 2
6749000	6751000	is going to go above ground
6751000	6753000	and it's now going to be on the continent of
6753000	6755000	Vilderand. There will still be
6755000	6757000	deep caverns but there will also be
6757000	6759000	weather, time of day cycles
6759000	6761000	and random events. You're going to be able to play
6761000	6763000	online and those of you
6763000	6765000	that feel burned by Blizzard, LAN.
6765000	6767000	LAN parties for Torchlight 2.
6767000	6769000	There you go. That's great. It'll totally
6769000	6771000	have features that every other game already has.
6771000	6773000	Except Starcraft 2. Score!
6773000	6775000	No you can't play
6775000	6777000	Starcraft 2 in it.
6777000	6779000	Well you can't play Starcraft 2 on LAN.
6779000	6781000	They took LAN out of Starcraft 2.
6781000	6783000	It's kind of a big deal.
6783000	6785000	There will be a
6785000	6787000	free peer to peer matchmaking service to meet
6787000	6789000	new players of similar level
6789000	6791000	and interest. Now I had heard
6791000	6793000	that they were going to do an MMO about this.
6793000	6795000	I guess that is also still in development.
6795000	6797000	It's a free to play Torchlight MMO.
6797000	6799000	This is not the same game.
6799000	6801000	But there is a multiplayer Torchlight game
6801000	6803000	on the way in 2011.
6803000	6805000	I think that's exciting to me. I don't know about you guys.
6805000	6807000	So there you go.
6807000	6809000	So sweet. Alright.
6809000	6811000	Well now is the mailbag part of the show except
6811000	6813000	Jamie is not here so
6813000	6815000	we're going to set the mailbag on fire ladies and gentlemen.
6815000	6817000	That's going to be another news story.
6817000	6819000	Damn! Where did I put my lighter?
6819000	6825000	Every week DarkSakura opens up the email bag at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com
6825000	6827000	and she reads some emails for us.
6827000	6829000	We listen to them live
6829000	6831000	as she reads them for us.
6831000	6833000	So DarkSakura, why don't you go ahead and read us an email.
6837000	6839000	This is some great radio right here.
6839000	6841000	Mailbag? No it's not mailbag.
6841000	6843000	I had another story.
6843000	6845000	Not anymore.
6845000	6847000	The music is playing. Read the mail.
6847000	6849000	Come on get to it. Mail.
6849000	6851000	Mail time.
6851000	6853000	Mail call.
6853000	6855000	Land shark.
6855000	6857000	Mail call beats the booty call.
6857000	6859000	Hey how you doing?
6859000	6861000	The window is actually closed and I don't know who closed it so whatever.
6861000	6863000	It was me.
6865000	6867000	Okay we can go with that.
6867000	6869000	Dan, why don't you pretend you're emailing OrangeLawnsRadio.
6869000	6871000	What would you say in an email to OrangeLawnsRadio?
6871000	6873000	Email's up. Dear Rob.
6873000	6875000	Shut up Dan. Dan should be on this show way more often.
6875000	6877000	For real Dan. Shut up.
6877000	6879000	He is so cool and such a pimp.
6879000	6881000	Hello all our crew. Blade3 here.
6881000	6883000	Just wanted to say keep up the great work with the shows.
6883000	6885000	I can't. Shows?
6885000	6887000	We have more than one show?
6887000	6889000	I can't live without them.
6889000	6891000	You're show-wa.
6891000	6893000	Not shows. Show-wa.
6893000	6895000	I'd like more shows.
6895000	6897000	Keep my week going and with school starting this week I'll need you more than ever.
6897000	6903000	And by the way PlayStation Move is stupid and I think Loki should smack everyone who buys one when he gets back thanks.
6903000	6905000	Punctuation.
6905000	6907000	Loki's never coming back.
6907000	6909000	Yes he is.
6909000	6911000	Oh god help us all.
6911000	6915000	We have one show but I think he means shows as in you know there's been 377 episodes.
6915000	6921000	Although I will say Extrofer and I really want to do the other show and I think I have a great concept now.
6921000	6927000	Now that I don't have school on the nights you had available.
6927000	6929000	I would like to do that still. It would be fun.
6929000	6931000	I want to do a show.
6931000	6933000	The Dan show.
6933000	6935000	Not by myself.
6935000	6937000	What would a Dan show sound like if Dan was by himself with a microphone?
6937000	6941000	I have a mic. Words.
6941000	6943000	See?
6943000	6945000	The Dan and Mystique show.
6945000	6947000	Oh shit.
6947000	6949000	All who oppose us would perish.
6949000	6951000	Second email.
6951000	6953000	Greetings number one show in the continental US.
6953000	6955000	We're the greatest in the galaxy.
6955000	6957000	Yeah we're actually the greatest in the galaxy.
6957000	6959000	Although when we had that decree.
6959000	6961000	Do you have the decree?
6961000	6963000	The decree does not say the number one.
6963000	6965000	It just says the official.
6965000	6967000	I had tape stuck to it.
6967000	6969000	But I'll take number one.
6969000	6971000	What is going on over there?
6971000	6973000	Official decree.
6973000	6977000	Orange Lounge Radio is the official video game podcast of the galaxy forever.
6977000	6979000	It doesn't say number one video game podcast.
6979000	6981000	But it is the official video game podcast.
6981000	6983000	Which makes it number one.
6983000	6985000	Now that we have been voted the number one show in the continental US.
6985000	6987000	I guess Hawaii would beat us or something.
6987000	6989000	Meaning like all those one up shows.
6989000	6991000	Unofficial.
6991000	6993000	Not official.
6993000	6995000	Giant bomb. It's not official.
6995000	6997000	Totally not official.
6997000	6999000	Reading the email.
6999000	7003000	I just heard a story on NPR about talks between Google and Verizon about paying extra for used bandwidth.
7003000	7009000	Decided that people who stream video and music and especially online gamers will pay a lot extra for the bandwidth used.
7009000	7013000	This is very troubling to me since I'm an online gamer primarily.
7013000	7019000	Google seems to be the last straw and if they give in all the dominoes will start falling.
7019000	7025000	I'm wondering why I haven't heard more of an outcry from the gamer community about this bandwidth issue.
7025000	7029000	Since it has been behind the scenes for a while now.
7029000	7033000	I also wonder what game studios and developers think of this.
7033000	7035000	I don't know what I'll do if rates go up anymore.
7035000	7037000	What do you guys think?
7037000	7039000	I got this.
7039000	7041000	Honestly you are the podcast I look forward to all week.
7041000	7043000	Your loyal turtle in Philly.
7043000	7045000	Serious turtle.
7045000	7047000	Did you say turdie?
7047000	7049000	Shut up.
7049000	7051000	Wouldn't that come out as Tilly?
7051000	7053000	Dan you had a comment on this email?
7053000	7057000	Yes. The reason there's no outcry about it is because if it's going to happen it's going to happen.
7057000	7063000	There's literally nothing you can do to stop the cable companies from eventually getting to charge you for bandwidth.
7063000	7065000	Actually there is something you could do.
7065000	7067000	Cancel your cable.
7067000	7069000	Cancel your cable.
7069000	7071000	Ultimately at the end of the day it's going to be your dollars that decide.
7071000	7079000	Keep in mind. The other thing to keep in mind. Cable is slowly spreading through more and more neighborhoods and so forth.
7079000	7083000	And if you're also willing to make the sacrifice to go to something like DSL which might not be as fast.
7083000	7089000	You know perhaps there will be DSL competitors that are going to have an open internet that won't charge for this stuff.
7089000	7093000	You know AT&T still competes with Comcast still competes with neighborhood providers and so forth.
7093000	7097000	Don't get me wrong folks. I think this sucks too.
7097000	7103000	But I'm just saying it might not be like you know eternal damnation for all of us.
7103000	7107000	I mean like there's going to be a limit that people are going to hit and they'll just cancel it.
7107000	7111000	Well because it's already started. The phone companies are doing it you know.
7111000	7118000	But there will always be somebody out there who's going to say hey you pay a little bit more and you can be unlimited.
7118000	7124000	The hope is that two things will happen. Number one competition will keep things cheap.
7124000	7129000	You know because there is more than one answer.
7129000	7134000	So if cable says okay we're charging you and DSL says oh no we're not.
7134000	7140000	You know everybody will jump over to DSL and cable will lose all their money so they'll come back around.
7140000	7146000	The other thing that you're kind of looking at with the whole cable or with the whole unlimited bandwidth thing.
7146000	7151000	Is that there are you know God help us government factions and that at work.
7151000	7159000	Where the argument is that because the internet now is practically essential for life.
7159000	7163000	That they'll get involved to keep price gouging from happening.
7163000	7165000	You know but who knows what's going to happen.
7165000	7169000	The truth is we're just going to have to you know gamers online people.
7169000	7175000	You know the bit torrent people who are the ones who are really screwed it up for everybody by sucking down massive amounts of bandwidth.
7175000	7185000	24-7, 365. Yeah you heard that. What's going to really happen is you know we're all going to have to deal with it.
7185000	7191000	And hopefully yeah we don't get we don't get punked too hard.
7191000	7195000	I would think they'd go after the torrenters first but I don't know.
7195000	7197000	The thing is though everyone's a torrenter now.
7197000	7198000	Yeah that's true.
7198000	7208000	There's so many people who do it that you know it's one of their big ideas especially because you know Comcast now is a media conglomerate.
7208000	7219000	So for them anything they can do to shut down a torrenter protects in their eyes their other you know their movie studio, TV studio, whatever connections.
7219000	7225000	So you know they yeah they want the bandwidth plus you know anything they can get away with charging us a little bit more money.
7225000	7228000	You know they want that money. Give me that money.
7228000	7229000	Give me all your money.
7229000	7231000	Give me all your money. Give me your money.
7231000	7234000	Well that's is that it for the e-mail bag tonight?
7234000	7235000	Yes it is.
7235000	7244000	All right mail bag at orange lounge radio dot com if you want to send us an e-mail in the future and hopefully you won't have to pay extra money through Comcast or whoever your service provider is to do so.
7244000	7246000	I know it's still free right now.
7246000	7251000	In the meantime how about some angst, some anger, some FUs.
7251000	7266000	Hubba hubba hubba.
7266000	7269000	FU to my software shield.
7269000	7272000	I defeated you.
7272000	7277000	And my hand for not being able to not hurt.
7277000	7280000	I'm about to go take some Vicodin.
7280000	7290000	My FU of the week goes to the fact that my weekend is almost over because I actually had a pretty awesome weekend between you know showgirls and other stuff.
7290000	7293000	Just you know I'm sad but whatever.
7293000	7295000	Life sucks.
7295000	7297000	Life sucks you know.
7297000	7298000	Shit happens.
7298000	7299000	All right.
7299000	7301000	Misty do you have FUs of the week?
7301000	7311000	Kind of. It's just mostly to work drama and bullshit. I'm not even going to name specific names.
7311000	7315000	Also to the fact that I have not won the lottery so I can't move out here yet.
7315000	7318000	FU to not winning the lottery. I can sign off.
7318000	7320000	Dan the man. Do you have some FUs?
7320000	7323000	I got to throw an FU out to the economy.
7323000	7326000	Believe it or not I miss having a job.
7326000	7332000	Having a job was actually a great way to break up your day.
7332000	7333000	And how.
7333000	7337000	And besides that no not too many.
7337000	7339000	FU to all who oppose me.
7339000	7341000	Fuck you.
7341000	7343000	I will fucking kill you.
7343000	7345000	Back at you.
7345000	7347000	Misty are you saying you oppose Dan?
7347000	7348000	Don't oppose me.
7348000	7351000	Uh oh. We might have a throw down.
7351000	7355000	Trust me between now and Friday I can make your life a living heck.
7355000	7357000	Alright.
7357000	7358000	Not compared to work.
7358000	7361000	Before we get back into the gaming news of which I have a story here.
7361000	7363000	News about gaming? That's amazing.
7363000	7365000	Soon we will get to the Skype line.
7365000	7369000	And then the callers call in and it just all goes wild from there.
7369000	7372000	Alright I want to ask Misty though.
7372000	7375000	What do you have planned for your week while you're here?
7375000	7376000	What are you going to do?
7376000	7378000	What stuff do you have to see?
7378000	7383000	Because I know when I think tourism I think Sacramento.
7383000	7387000	I think we should go to the zoo.
7387000	7389000	That would be nice.
7389000	7393000	But yeah mainly obligatory Arviggle time.
7393000	7395000	Sunrise for Para Para.
7395000	7397000	Feed Jamie to a giraffe if you go to the zoo.
7397000	7399000	No no no red pandas.
7399000	7402000	Why would I do that? Dan maybe but not Jamie.
7402000	7407000	Dan will get eaten by a Gru.
7407000	7411000	Since when do they keep Gru's at zoos?
7411000	7413000	Are you guys going to go to San Francisco?
7413000	7417000	If we get enough people to help me with gas and parking.
7417000	7419000	I think you guys will have fun.
7419000	7421000	Because like Dan said we're pretty broke but.
7421000	7423000	I don't know why your mic sucks but.
7423000	7424000	How about this okay.
7424000	7425000	Much better yes.
7425000	7429000	If I have assistance with parking and everything and we eat cheap.
7429000	7432000	And I don't completely blow my budget at Daiso.
7432000	7436000	Or at Ichibancon then we should be fine.
7436000	7439000	Sometimes you can find street parking it's just really rare.
7439000	7444000	The garage is fine because honestly if you eat at like one of the little restaurants in there.
7444000	7445000	They'll all validate.
7445000	7446000	Oh Japantown?
7446000	7447000	Yeah Japantown.
7447000	7449000	Because I figured except I really kind of.
7449000	7452000	Well except that one garage that I feel most secure going to.
7452000	7455000	Is also the most expensive in the Castro.
7455000	7458000	Because I totally want to go to Naya.
7458000	7460000	The gelato place.
7460000	7462000	You can go to Naya in Berkeley.
7462000	7463000	You should go to hot cookie.
7463000	7464000	You know what hot cookie is?
7464000	7466000	It's the cookie store they sell cookies and underwear.
7466000	7467000	And pantsu.
7467000	7469000	They sell cookies and panties that's.
7469000	7470000	Yep.
7470000	7471000	Really it.
7471000	7472000	Can't we just hit yogurt.
7472000	7476000	Actually yogurt is right around the corner from my house.
7476000	7477000	Exactly.
7477000	7478000	I wish I could go with you gals but.
7478000	7479000	I have to work.
7479000	7480000	I don't have a lot of time.
7480000	7483000	If I want to go to gay days this year I have to keep working.
7483000	7485000	We'll get your man to entertain us.
7485000	7486000	Alright.
7486000	7487000	Anyhow back to gaming news then.
7487000	7489000	Let's get into this story about Xfire.
7489000	7490000	Do you guys remember Xfire?
7490000	7493000	Because I was using Xfire a couple years ago then I like stopped.
7493000	7494000	I do.
7494000	7496000	Steam kind of took its place for me.
7496000	7499000	But I guess there's still a lot of people using Xfire and Xfire is still around.
7499000	7503000	But Xfire got bought this week.
7503000	7509000	And they sent out a release to their 17 million users saying quote Xfire was bought by new owners today.
7509000	7513000	Most of the team that has built Xfire over the last six years is leaving.
7513000	7518000	We enjoyed working for you over the last 127 releases and wish we could stay to create the next 127.
7518000	7520000	Good luck and.
7520000	7521000	I'm sorry goodbye.
7521000	7522000	Good luck and game on.
7522000	7527000	That's kind of a thinly veiled like we just got bought and all laid off.
7527000	7528000	That's kind of sad actually.
7528000	7530000	Why did they get bought?
7530000	7534000	Well they were bought by Titan Gaming and they're based out of Los Angeles.
7534000	7538000	They have what's called skill based gaming technology.
7538000	7541000	Read that as money competitive gaming.
7541000	7544000	Titan will be taking on the Xfire name.
7544000	7548000	They're going to focus on ongoing innovation in the gaming space.
7548000	7552000	At least that's you know what the message says on their Titan website.
7552000	7556000	Quote the Xfire services will continue uninterrupted for its users.
7556000	7561000	And it will help gaming companies better engage their users and monetize their games.
7561000	7563000	Interesting.
7563000	7570000	They're saying that this might be to try and position Titan Gaming to compete better with things like virgin gaming and so forth.
7570000	7576000	But I believe the sound you're going to hear right now is millions of users canceling their Xfire accounts that they haven't already.
7576000	7580000	I'm going to be honest. I haven't used Xfire since Steam came out.
7580000	7582000	I was like Xfire? Really?
7582000	7583000	I know.
7583000	7586000	They got bought? Imagine that.
7586000	7587000	There it goes.
7587000	7595000	Tigerclaws says if you go to Xfire.com you can watch a bunch of live streams of people playing on it and it's mostly wow. Really?
7595000	7597000	Man that's just what I want to see.
7597000	7602000	Well let's go to Xfire.com right now and watch some a-holes play some wow.
7602000	7604000	Let's see we're going to go to Xfire.com.
7604000	7606000	To do live radio. I love this.
7606000	7611000	Actually you know what? We need some theme music as we go to Xfire.com that was recently purchased by Titan.
7611000	7616000	Benny Hill.
7616000	7618000	This song works for practically everything.
7618000	7621000	Videos. Live videos.
7621000	7622000	Let's see here.
7622000	7625000	There's Starcraft 2 going on live.
7625000	7627000	Worst rogue priest in USA.
7627000	7629000	That doesn't even make sense.
7629000	7630000	How does that work?
7630000	7632000	There's some people doing arenas.
7632000	7635000	Yeah these are like all wow videos.
7635000	7642000	I want to see worst rogue priest in the USA.
7642000	7644000	Where is it?
7644000	7648000	I clicked on it and nothing happened.
7648000	7650000	This is the worst segment ever.
7650000	7652000	Rob is fail at the internet.
7652000	7656000	Clearly. Oh I clicked on the wrong link. This website sucks.
7656000	7658000	Xfire live video.
7658000	7661000	So now you're blaming the website.
7661000	7663000	We're going to snoop in you guys.
7663000	7668000	Cyclone.
7668000	7671000	Cyclone.
7671000	7672000	Roots.
7672000	7677000	I'm casting cyclone. I'm casting roots.
7677000	7678000	Needs more magic music.
7678000	7683000	I got blind and uh.
7683000	7684000	I'm getting drunk.
7684000	7687000	I fucking just fell asleep right there in that little piece.
7687000	7692000	I mean how much did they sell this website for? 40 bucks? Because that's about what it's worth.
7692000	7695000	It's 20 more than I would have paid.
7695000	7697000	Although I've got to say.
7697000	7701000	Couldn't we just do our show on Xfire?
7701000	7703000	There might be more.
7703000	7709000	We could go on there and uh you know go on uh and do like a live wow stream and be all like hi you're listening to orange on video.
7709000	7712000	Cyclone. Cyclone.
7712000	7714000	Roots.
7714000	7716000	And cyclone.
7716000	7718000	Magic missile.
7718000	7721000	I'm going to use intimidating shout.
7721000	7723000	That really is a wow move actually.
7723000	7726000	I know.
7726000	7729000	Dan only knows that from watching South Park.
7729000	7731000	Alright.
7731000	7735000	No no see I didn't work in a video game store for 10 years or nothing.
7735000	7737000	People might talk about Warcraft there.
7737000	7742000	In fact I banned my assistant manager from talking about Warcraft.
7742000	7746000	He'd talk about Warcraft and I'd be like no I need you to do some work.
7746000	7749000	So if he came into work one day and started going cyclone.
7749000	7752000	You know what's amazing about that? That was live.
7752000	7757000	That wasn't planned. That was actually happening right now somewhere.
7757000	7761000	That just happened.
7761000	7763000	Anyhow.
7763000	7768000	One more story from Dark Sakura and one more from me and then we're going to open up the phone lines and if you thought cyclone was bad.
7768000	7770000	Alright. Dark Sakura.
7770000	7773000	Well Treasure actually.
7773000	7777000	They are wanting to work on another 3D shooting game.
7777000	7781000	And if you have really good programming skills and live in Japan.
7781000	7784000	You actually might be able to make it.
7784000	7789000	They have a job listing on their website looking for a new project 3D action shooting game.
7789000	7793000	And they are advertising.
7793000	7796000	Dude we should send this actually to Krista.
7796000	7799000	Have her work for Treshar.
7799000	7802000	I'm surprised you're not applying for this.
7802000	7804000	I can't program shit.
7804000	7806000	You can learn fast.
7806000	7807000	I'm going to link this to Krista.
7807000	7811000	You could lie about your qualifications like in Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead.
7811000	7815000	That was great. Oh I see you graduated from Vassar.
7815000	7817000	I'm right on top of it Rose.
7817000	7819000	You know I saw that in the theater.
7819000	7820000	Me too.
7820000	7822000	The dishes are done man.
7822000	7825000	Why are we quoting a movie that's like 20 years old?
7825000	7827000	Because movies are awesome.
7827000	7831000	We have some listeners that weren't even born yet when that movie came out.
7831000	7833000	Fuck them.
7833000	7835000	It's on DVD.
7835000	7837000	Maybe.
7837000	7840000	Well they've put worse shit on DVD from what I hear.
7840000	7842000	I don't specifically know what but yeah.
7842000	7843000	Alright.
7843000	7845000	Let's talk Starcraft 2.
7845000	7846000	And how.
7846000	7853000	And Dan you better be careful because you know this house is prone to getting these spy bots and these bad things in it.
7853000	7856000	And this is important to know about Starcraft 2.
7856000	7860000	Actually this is actually halfway serious because there are a lot of phishing scams out there.
7860000	7863000	And I'm not talking about like phishing like you know.
7863000	7865000	Reel her in.
7865000	7867000	I'm talking phishing like P.H.
7867000	7868000	Wow.
7868000	7869000	I'm not like talking Dreamcast phishing.
7869000	7871000	The great thing is he's looking right at me.
7871000	7872000	I know.
7872000	7873000	And he's saying that like I'm not going to understand.
7873000	7874000	You need to understand.
7874000	7875000	No Dan.
7875000	7876000	Dan.
7876000	7877000	Why aren't you looking at.
7877000	7878000	Listen to the words.
7878000	7880000	Why aren't you looking at DarkSakura over there.
7880000	7891000	This spy bot search and destroy herself who's downloaded 15 viruses in the time that we've watched the show and managed to managed to kill them all.
7891000	7894000	Then she's looking at me like she's hurt.
7894000	7899000	She dumped like a gallon of bleach hypothetically into her computer to clean up any possible viruses.
7899000	7900000	See that's what I'm saying.
7900000	7902000	Yeah and you want to know exactly how it got rid of it actually.
7902000	7906000	I finally ended up doing a Windows search finding the DLLs and deleting them.
7906000	7907000	See.
7907000	7909000	And what was the DLL called?
7909000	7910000	Fuck if I can remember.
7910000	7911000	There's also a few EXEs attached to it.
7911000	7912000	But I got rid of them.
7912000	7913000	I thought it was called STD.
7913000	7917000	No the STD one was one that was among the list of those.
7917000	7920000	But the things that I have are from like last year.
7920000	7921000	All the instructions.
7921000	7923000	And the program has changed since.
7923000	7924000	So they've renamed all the stuff.
7924000	7926000	So I had to go back and find them.
7926000	7928000	But I took care of it.
7928000	7931000	It's like a Pokemon but STD.
7931000	7945000	And it was also actually every time I would stop the process it would restart the process through a different database builder that I had built in.
7945000	7949000	So I actually had to delete the database builder and the program.
7949000	7951000	It's like Skynet yo.
7951000	7954000	Did your computer become self aware?
7954000	7956000	It touches itself Rob.
7956000	7957000	Alright.
7957000	7959000	Can I move on talking about Starcraft 2 here?
7959000	7960000	It sure is aware of itself.
7960000	7961000	If you must.
7961000	7967000	Be wary because there are a lot of phishing emails going out there about certain Starcraft 2 promotions.
7967000	7974000	For example if there's an email that you get about new free maps or a new mount for Warcraft.
7974000	7975000	I guess this kind of crosses over.
7975000	7978000	Or you know any type of extra Starcraft 2 stuff.
7978000	7985000	They're trying to get your battle.net account info to try and get your activation key for the game.
7985000	7988000	So be careful there's a lot of phishing emails out there.
7988000	7991000	Obviously it's been going on in World of Warcraft 4 forever.
7991000	7996000	Unfortunately Blizzard hasn't really been able to fight it outside of the authenticator.
7996000	8000000	Which is a little silly that they've had to release this authenticator to protect accounts.
8000000	8003000	I mean but unfortunately they're just so prone to getting hacked.
8003000	8004000	I mean my own account was hacked.
8004000	8006000	I mentioned earlier in the show.
8006000	8008000	You know last year and it sucked.
8008000	8011000	It was kind of like virtual rape.
8011000	8013000	Like it was just my character.
8013000	8015000	Somebody played my character.
8015000	8017000	Played with my character when I didn't know.
8017000	8019000	It's just very sad.
8019000	8022000	What's ridiculous is it's the class of cybercriminal.
8022000	8025000	You know they're just doing it to fuck with people.
8025000	8028000	Because I mean really why wouldn't you just steal their bank account number.
8028000	8032000	Or you know something where you could actually steal some money.
8032000	8034000	Well a lot of times they do that too.
8034000	8041000	In fact there actually is a big login message in World of Warcraft now that says don't use the same password for Warcraft that you do any other website.
8041000	8044000	Because if they get your password for Warcraft they'll get your other passwords too.
8044000	8048000	Why is that funny?
8048000	8052000	Because I could just see some guy putting in his password which is undoubtedly password.
8052000	8060000	For his bank account and his World of Warcraft and his you know everything.
8060000	8064000	And then being like oh my god I lost all my money.
8064000	8069000	Oh but the real tragedy is they cleaned out my Warcraft character.
8069000	8071000	You deserve it.
8071000	8076000	Nobody deserves to have their Warcraft character raped.
8076000	8078000	I'm sorry Rob.
8078000	8080000	I know that hit a little too close.
8080000	8082000	Well there may be a few people.
8082000	8086000	Yes Monty Boggs in our chat room says did he touch your character in the swimsuit area.
8086000	8088000	And I play a Tauren for heaven's sake.
8088000	8091000	Yes he did touch the Tauren in the swimsuit area.
8091000	8094000	That's how desperate these people are.
8094000	8100000	Alright Frisbee in our chat room says password 12345 to which Bonds006 says dammit now I have to go change my password.
8100000	8105000	That's the same password I have on my luggage.
8105000	8114000	The great thing is I read somewhere in this last week that they're cracking down on people who are having relations in World of Warcraft now.
8114000	8116000	Why can't they go after these companies?
8116000	8120000	Like I realize they're in another country or whatever but isn't Blizzard established in a lot of these other countries?
8120000	8122000	Why don't they go after these guys legally?
8122000	8124000	I mean it's a bad thing that they're doing.
8124000	8128000	Well wait wait wait they have roleplay servers for a reason.
8128000	8130000	Yeah well apparently they don't care.
8130000	8135000	Because some 10 year old went wandering on into one of those roleplay servers I guess.
8135000	8139000	Yes in a completely unrelated type of story although I think that's what you're referring to.
8139000	8146000	Blizzard actually announced this week kind of unofficially on the forums they were going to patrol one of the servers a little more because of the roleplay.
8146000	8155000	This server is kind of known for being the adult roleplay server and people like to roleplay in the tavern in Goldshire.
8155000	8156000	Right that's what I read.
8156000	8158000	And I can't remember the name of the server.
8158000	8160000	You're in the tavern getting drunk.
8160000	8165000	If there's any girls there I want to do them.
8165000	8171000	But what's amazing about RP servers is that there's just as many griefers as there are actual RPers.
8171000	8174000	So you can just imagine what these servers look like some days.
8174000	8176000	You know that almost makes me want to play Warcraft.
8176000	8178000	You just want to be a griefer.
8178000	8179000	Oh yes.
8179000	8181000	Oh no you want to do adult RP.
8181000	8182000	Admit it Dan.
8182000	8184000	I can do adult RP at home.
8184000	8185000	Trust me bitch.
8185000	8186000	Oh really now.
8186000	8187000	Being an adult sucks.
8187000	8188000	I'd rather do 10 year old RP.
8188000	8190000	They'd be like why is your character sitting there on the ground.
8190000	8192000	I'm playing with GI Joes.
8192000	8193000	It's amazing.
8193000	8196000	Lance of Longinus.
8196000	8202000	If you want to give us a call 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
8202000	8204000	The Skype line is open.
8204000	8208000	1-877-GAME-OLR or OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype.
8208000	8210000	Call and harass Dan for me.
8210000	8212000	Game-olar.
8212000	8214000	We should have a segment called Make Dan Laugh.
8214000	8215000	Haha.
8215000	8216000	Alright.
8216000	8218000	That's not that hard.
8218000	8219000	Let's see.
8219000	8220000	I'm known as Chuckles.
8220000	8224000	Yeah SalaciousPop in our chat is following up with the details of the story there.
8224000	8227000	There is one particular roleplay server that has been earmarked for erotic chat.
8227000	8229000	Apparently it gets pretty explicit.
8229000	8230000	Dude I want to play there.
8230000	8231000	I love the word erotic.
8231000	8234000	All level 5 toons in the human side starter in.
8234000	8241000	Tigerclaw says speaking of Starcraft you have the story about Blizzard removing Starcraft 2 maps due to inappropriate content right?
8241000	8245000	I did hear about that. All the wang maps and penis looking maps and you know.
8245000	8248000	Quit making maps that look suggestive.
8248000	8250000	Attack your balls.
8250000	8251000	Alright.
8251000	8255000	Hahahaha.
8255000	8257000	You have to defend your zone.
8257000	8259000	Haven't you heard like.
8259000	8261000	Let's be honest. If the Zerg attacked your groin.
8261000	8271000	Starcraft 2 apparently has these crazy like as modes where like you can like make RP games and like.
8271000	8273000	Ooo erotic roleplay in Starcraft.
8273000	8274000	Coming soon.
8274000	8275000	Jesus.
8275000	8277000	Yes my child.
8277000	8279000	Your soldiers are all really tiny.
8279000	8280000	Let's go to the phones.
8280000	8281000	I just don't see how that would be exciting.
8281000	8283000	Hi you're on OrangeLion's radio. Who's this?
8283000	8285000	Yo.
8285000	8286000	Yo.
8286000	8287000	Yo.
8287000	8288000	What up?
8288000	8294000	Hello there O.L.R. Speaking of which. Speaking of Swede. If it's that one. Swede.
8294000	8295000	Ahem.
8295000	8298000	It's our crazy Swede Aki Ripper is calling in.
8298000	8300000	Jesus heck is this.
8300000	8301000	Oh shut up.
8301000	8303000	He's one of our official Swedes.
8303000	8305000	Dan we have listeners all over the world.
8305000	8307000	Oh he's. This is real.
8307000	8308000	Yes this is a real guy.
8308000	8309000	Yeah well.
8309000	8311000	I thought that guy was just putting on a voice.
8311000	8313000	No he's really. Well at least as far as we know.
8313000	8315000	I'm pretty impressed now actually.
8315000	8319000	No no no no. Dan I am from Sweden.
8319000	8324000	Oh well that's a really bad example but well.
8324000	8326000	He just went off on you in Swedish.
8326000	8327000	How is the chef?
8327000	8329000	That was hot.
8329000	8332000	I have a question about Sweden I want to know.
8332000	8334000	I have to know this.
8334000	8340000	Okay so in Sweden do you guys call Swedish fish just fish?
8340000	8341000	No we don't.
8341000	8344000	Because they're delicious and they're red.
8344000	8346000	We don't fish.
8346000	8350000	Well some of us do but it's like dying out.
8350000	8352000	He said some of us do. Thank you.
8352000	8354000	I'm glad that you confirmed that for me.
8354000	8358000	But on the subject of fish though.
8358000	8360000	Yes I will.
8360000	8368000	Because I live in that part of Sweden where you know the thing where rotten fish is supposedly popular.
8368000	8373000	Oh wait but it isn't rotten it's just like fermented beyond fermented.
8373000	8379000	And yeah so called soothed minted.
8379000	8382000	So do you guys like eat them or do you just smell them?
8382000	8387000	Anyway what did you call in for tonight?
8387000	8388000	What's the point?
8388000	8390000	Dan stop egging him on.
8390000	8393000	Dan Aki Ripper what did you call in to talk about tonight?
8393000	8395000	That's what I said.
8395000	8406000	Well Blizzard still won't let me play Starcraft 2 but here goes the thing though.
8406000	8415000	I tried to call their customer service two times and it was all busy.
8415000	8422000	And I was like screw this I'm going to start playing Sims 3.
8422000	8424000	Can you play Starcraft 1?
8424000	8439000	And speaking of Sims 3 there has been like a few talks well in a recent tweet thing about the coming expansion.
8439000	8443000	Sims late night or what is it no.
8443000	8448000	Yeah Sims 3 late night the latest expansion or whatever.
8448000	8451000	Is this with erotic roleplay as well?
8451000	8454000	Sims late night sounds kind of kinky.
8454000	8455000	Isn't that why they killed Sims Online?
8455000	8460000	Yeah Sims Online turned into just it was so sinful what was going on.
8460000	8461000	Exactly.
8461000	8462000	Sims Online.
8462000	8464000	And that's what the Sims always comes into.
8464000	8468000	Everyone who plays Sims is a pervo.
8468000	8471000	Dan shut up I played Sims.
8471000	8477000	Hold on hold on Aki Ripper I want to rewind a little bit because you're still mad at Blizzard and rightfully so.
8477000	8480000	But I have some ideas for you on how to take your revenge on Blizzard.
8480000	8487000	And one of them you just brought up this stanky rotten fish thing you need to send Blizzard a can of that.
8487000	8492000	So is it like you can't play any Blizzard games can you play Starcraft 1 for example?
8492000	8494000	I don't think it will help in a kind of way.
8494000	8506000	And well one kind of thing that pisses me a bit off is that well while I have apparently some way on getting that authenticator.
8506000	8513000	My current cell phone that I use don't support the authenticator unfortunately.
8513000	8516000	Can you get the little physical one?
8516000	8518000	What time is it in Sweden?
8518000	8520000	It's three thirty in the morning.
8520000	8523000	You talked about the Blizzard authenticator.
8523000	8525000	Yeah the actual one not the mobile one.
8525000	8530000	Which is available to some cell phones.
8530000	8540000	My problem is that the current cell phone that I'm using at the moment I can't use that because it's not a symbian cell phone.
8540000	8545000	I can remember they sell a stand alone one that's not just for cell phones.
8545000	8547000	It's like you push a little button on it.
8547000	8549000	Alan has one and I used to have one a couple years ago.
8549000	8552000	It's like a physical authenticator you don't need a mobile phone for it.
8552000	8560000	Which is good because I will most likely order that one instead of the one on a cell phone.
8560000	8562000	AK Ripper we got to let you go to get more calls.
8562000	8564000	Everybody was trying to get through to talk to Dan tonight.
8564000	8566000	But thank you very much.
8566000	8567000	Take care.
8567000	8569000	Anyway once again for all.
8569000	8572000	Your show rocks beyond the den.
8572000	8574000	I love you AK Ripper.
8574000	8575000	By the way one other suggestion.
8575000	8582000	Actually tonight since actually Dan and well Misty and all those guesses was quite fun.
8582000	8585000	If you want to make Blizzard really upset.
8585000	8587000	Threaten to take away Ikea.
8587000	8589000	Right.
8589000	8591000	Swedish people will.
8591000	8595000	AK Ripper you take care buddy.
8595000	8597000	Good luck with your Blizzard drama.
8597000	8598000	Bye.
8598000	8602000	Dude why do you think I've been listening for practically 300 episodes now?
8602000	8603000	Good time.
8603000	8606000	Hey you see that's what we should do tomorrow is go to Ikea.
8606000	8607000	Ikea?
8607000	8609000	You should go have meatballs.
8609000	8611000	We're going to Ikea for lunch.
8611000	8612000	I'm not.
8612000	8614000	We got a call coming in.
8614000	8615000	Hey behave.
8615000	8617000	Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio who's this?
8617000	8618000	Behave.
8618000	8619000	This.
8619000	8621000	Well this is.
8621000	8623000	If you're from Sweden we're hanging out.
8623000	8624000	Oh I can't understand.
8624000	8625000	Dan.
8625000	8626000	Shush.
8626000	8627000	Just for a minute.
8627000	8629000	You sit there and you shush.
8629000	8630000	Okay.
8630000	8631000	Okay sorry caller.
8631000	8632000	I'm sorry.
8632000	8633000	Hi Blaisekin.
8633000	8635000	Okay hi Blaisekin how are you?
8635000	8644000	I'm doing fine and actually I'm kind of excited about the 3DS but not as much as if there
8644000	8648000	were Beatmania or DJ Max coming to the PS3.
8648000	8649000	Wait hold on.
8649000	8651000	I got a real quick question for you.
8651000	8653000	Where are you from?
8653000	8656000	I'm straight out of Omaha, Nebraska.
8656000	8661000	Stuck here in the middle of the United States of America with the best music arcade in America.
8661000	8662000	Okay wait.
8662000	8663000	Hold on.
8663000	8664000	Hold that thought for a minute.
8664000	8665000	Dan.
8665000	8666000	He's from Omaha, Nebraska.
8666000	8667000	That's not Sweden.
8667000	8668000	That's not Sweden.
8668000	8670000	I don't even think they have Ikea in Nebraska.
8670000	8671000	Nebraska almost worse.
8671000	8672000	Alright.
8672000	8673000	Shush.
8673000	8674000	Almost worse.
8674000	8675000	I haven't been to Nebraska yet.
8675000	8678000	Keep in mind I'm going to be smacking him like a red-headed stepchild later.
8678000	8679000	Alright.
8679000	8680000	Can I help?
8680000	8681000	The 3DS.
8681000	8686000	Now you do know there is DJ Hero on the 3DS but I don't know if you're a fan of that.
8686000	8687000	Actually do you know what?
8687000	8689000	I made a sketch.
8689000	8694000	About a few months ago while sitting in lunch at high school and trying to figure out because
8694000	8698640	I kind of rumored you know how Guitar Hero came to the 3DS so I was kind of figuring
8698640	8704100	out how the heck they're going to pull off DJ Hero on 3DS and my thing was like the same
8704100	8712840	thing that they did for Guitar Hero but just put a miniature turntable into the GBA slot
8712840	8717480	with the buttons on there and then have the cross fader on the touch screen.
8717480	8718480	That's no GBA.
8718480	8719480	That's my idea.
8719480	8720480	That's no GBA.
8720480	8721480	You're really close.
8721480	8723920	The cross fader is on the touch screen so is the turntable.
8723920	8724920	That's how they do it.
8724920	8725920	Aww.
8725920	8726920	What?
8726920	8728400	There's no peripheral on the bottom.
8728400	8729400	I didn't play it.
8729400	8734040	I heard all this secondhand from Shane but seriously go listen to the E3 shows which
8734040	8736520	are still on iTunes and on the website.
8736520	8737520	Wednesday.
8737520	8738520	Tuesday.
8738520	8739520	No.
8739520	8740520	Tuesday's E3 show.
8740520	8743680	The first E3 show, whenever that was, we talked about DJ Hero on the 3DS because he actually
8743680	8744680	played it.
8744680	8745680	I missed it.
8745680	8750160	He was playing Ridge Racer on the 3DS which sucks balls.
8750160	8751160	Only balls?
8751160	8752160	Yeah.
8752160	8760040	Especially for steering unless you're using the little analog that they got on there.
8760040	8762160	That's how I play on the PSP.
8762160	8766920	I cannot stand on the touch screen too.
8766920	8768120	The collision was so weird.
8768120	8772040	When you run into your wall, the car would rotate like 15 degrees at a time.
8772040	8773040	It wasn't very smooth.
8773040	8774040	Oh.
8774040	8775040	It is Ridge Racer.
8775040	8776040	Anyway, wait.
8776040	8777040	Hold on.
8777040	8778040	This is the real question I want to ask.
8778040	8781840	DJ Blazekin said he was drawing this out while he was in high school, kind of doodling it
8781840	8782840	sounds like.
8782840	8783840	Okay.
8783840	8787960	I don't know about you but when I was of that age, in high school, in junior high and even
8787960	8791080	grade school a little bit, you know what we used to draw when we were bored?
8791080	8795680	We would draw out those little adventure games where you would draw your lair.
8795680	8797120	Don't you remember this?
8797120	8798360	Was this just me?
8798360	8804880	You draw out the lair and there might be a pit full of alligators and a vine and things.
8804880	8812600	It was basically a poor man's Dungeons and Dragons mixed with an 8-bit video game.
8812600	8820760	We made many, many poor graph paper, six sided die, ghetto RPGs.
8820760	8823760	And there would always be a woman with big boobies at the end of the maze that you were
8823760	8828080	trying to get to.
8828080	8831640	I don't know why I decided to talk about that but I did.
8831640	8835400	I wanted to do it back in my day story.
8835400	8836400	Okay.
8836400	8843720	You know how the new DJ Max Technical, which I haven't played yet, but the only thing near
8843720	8854400	to that we even have here in Omaha is DJ, or not DJ Max, BeatMania 13 Distorted is
8854400	8855680	what we got over here.
8855680	8860080	And I'll tell you this straight up, the Family Fun Center is what it's called over here.
8860080	8864080	They've kept a majority of their music games up and running like perfect health.
8864080	8871000	Now, I've got to give a giant F you to my local malls arcade because one of my favorite
8871000	8876000	games down there, a music game in particular, In the Groove, which I play frequently when
8876000	8877000	I go there.
8877000	8880640	Well, my mom's getting her nails done and whatnot.
8880640	8882640	That is one way to kill time.
8882640	8885080	Basically, it's down.
8885080	8889700	And the game's been out of commission for more than a month.
8889700	8891600	How long do you...
8891600	8895200	Do you ever go to the nail salon and inhale the fumes in there before you go play In the
8895200	8896200	Groove?
8896200	8897200	No.
8897200	8898200	I know.
8898200	8899200	It really, really improves the experience.
8899200	8900840	I was going to say, maybe that's what makes the game fun.
8900840	8901840	I'm just kidding.
8901840	8902840	No.
8902840	8903840	No, no, no, no, no.
8903840	8908560	But I usually have my own little USB flash drive with my custom songs on it to play on
8908560	8911120	it, which I have all the DDR soundtrack songs.
8911120	8913060	Oh, well that's cool, yeah.
8913060	8916840	That was pretty cool when they opened it up on that last patch to all the USB stuff.
8916840	8917840	That was neat.
8917840	8918840	I'll give you that.
8918840	8923320	Yeah, and here's the thing.
8923320	8926320	I'm actually visually impaired in one eye myself.
8926320	8929800	Black Wolf is not the only one that has a vision problem.
8929800	8933720	I'm kind of ultimately at the same point, because I can only see well in one eye.
8933720	8938200	Well, I can think of two listeners we have at least that have both eyes blind.
8938200	8941800	Didn't In the Groove get sued out of existence?
8941800	8943440	Yeah, it got sued.
8943440	8946600	It got annihilated by judgments, basically.
8946600	8949080	It was sued out of commission.
8949080	8951280	But that's a whole nother show.
8951280	8956640	In the Groove though, like players and DDRs, one, you didn't have a bunch of friggin background
8956640	8963720	videos going on with flashing arrows, which it's just like solid color arrows, no background
8963720	8964720	video.
8964720	8966920	It's way easier to see.
8966920	8973240	And even completely 2020 sighted players I've talked to say that it's better and easier
8973240	8977040	to play it in DDR for getting the notes.
8977040	8978040	Awesome.
8978040	8979040	All right.
8979040	8981840	We're going to let you go, dude, because we've got to get more calls.
8981840	8984200	But I got one last question for you guys.
8984200	8985200	Make it quick.
8985200	8986200	Make it quick.
8986200	8990000	Do you think there's a possibility of DJ Max Technica on the DS?
8990000	8993560	I wouldn't hold my breath.
8993560	8995320	Anything is possible.
8995320	8998280	It's always about sales and how much those dev kits are going to cost.
8998280	9001840	I wouldn't expect it for at least a year because those dev kits are going to have to come down
9001840	9002840	in price a little bit.
9002840	9004240	So don't get your hopes up for right away.
9004240	9007080	All you got for right now is DJ Hero.
9007080	9010400	And if you're lucky, somebody will come up with another innovative music game.
9010400	9016840	Let's not forget the DS is what gave us Elite Beat Agents, which is basically DJ Max Technica.
9016840	9018800	I mean, right?
9018800	9025400	So I've never played Technica in the States and is now on sale with accessories for $9.99.
9025400	9026400	It has Flee.
9026400	9027400	That's a kickass song.
9027400	9028400	All right, buddy.
9028400	9029400	We're gonna let you go to get more calls.
9029400	9030400	You take care.
9030400	9031400	Have a good one.
9031400	9032400	Peace out.
9032400	9033400	Bye.
9033400	9034400	Bye.
9034400	9035400	Okay.
9035400	9036400	Let's go to another call.
9036400	9037400	Hello.
9037400	9038400	You're on Orange Lawn's radio.
9038400	9039400	Who's this?
9039400	9040400	Hey, this is X-Link.
9040400	9041400	Hi, X-Link.
9041400	9042400	Hi.
9042400	9043400	How are you?
9043400	9044400	Hey.
9044400	9045400	Doing good.
9045400	9046400	Awesome.
9046400	9047400	What's on your mind?
9047400	9048400	You know, it made me laugh when you're talking about the erotic chat.
9048400	9049400	And wow, it made me think of some of the stuff that some of the chats we have late at night
9049400	9050400	here on the guild.
9050400	9051400	Wow.
9051400	9052400	No, no.
9052400	9053400	No, no.
9053400	9054400	Hold up.
9054400	9055400	Ryan and I are in the same guild.
9055400	9056400	Yeah.
9056400	9057400	I picked that up real quick.
9057400	9058400	No, no, no.
9058400	9059400	They're dick and fart jokes.
9059400	9060400	They're not anything actually.
9060400	9061400	Yeah, whatever.
9061400	9062720	But the whole team is in the guild as well.
9062720	9065400	It only gets more and more kinky.
9065400	9067320	Let me guess.
9067320	9069360	Jamie's in there too, huh?
9069360	9071240	She was for like a day.
9071240	9072440	Everybody's been on this but me.
9072440	9074040	No, Rob, I got to level 20.
9074040	9077000	Why do I miss all the hot erotic chat?
9077000	9078000	You're on...
9078000	9079000	Oh, don't worry, Dan.
9079000	9080000	It's your like.
9080000	9081000	I also need a transcript.
9081000	9082000	Dan, you are unemployed.
9082000	9083340	Now is the perfect time to play WoW.
9083340	9084340	Exactly.
9084340	9086880	You're like the fourth person to that.
9086880	9087880	Rob, Rob, Rob.
9087880	9088880	What?
9088880	9090740	Dan lives with me, so he's going to be playing Star Trek online.
9090740	9092740	Oh sh...
9092740	9094740	Lock yourself in your room.
9094740	9095740	Get a laptop.
9095740	9097740	See this wallpaper?
9097740	9098740	Deep Space Nine.
9098740	9100740	I know. Star Trek Online.
9100740	9101740	It's okay.
9101740	9102740	You know what's terrible?
9102740	9104740	When I was a teenager, I was a Trekkie.
9104740	9106740	I mean hardcore.
9106740	9108740	The posters, the movies, you know,
9108740	9110740	knowing Klingon, the whole works.
9110740	9112740	It was a show.
9112740	9114740	It was the show on television.
9114740	9116740	Yeah. Well now, my wife,
9116740	9118740	ten years too late,
9118740	9120740	has decided that she's going to be a Trekkie.
9120740	9121740	No, no, no, no, no.
9121740	9123740	That would have worked out for me, you know,
9123740	9124740	years ago.
9124740	9126740	Now it's just like, really?
9126740	9128740	Star Trek? That's cute.
9128740	9129740	No, no, no, no.
9129740	9131740	Although admittedly I do kind of want some con cologne.
9131740	9133740	Did you take her to the tour that's at Mather?
9133740	9134740	No, we stopped to go.
9134740	9135740	I do want to go too.
9135740	9136740	I want to go too.
9136740	9137740	Keep in mind...
9137740	9139740	Keep in mind, I missed Deep Space Nine
9139740	9141740	when it was on TV.
9141740	9143740	I watched a few episodes here and there,
9143740	9145740	but I was also in school.
9145740	9147740	I had college to do.
9147740	9149740	So her and her friends come over
9149740	9151740	and they take over my big screen TV and my surround system
9151740	9153740	and they sit on my couch
9153740	9155740	and they watch Deep Space Nine on my big screen TV.
9155740	9156740	How is that a problem?
9156740	9158740	It's not a problem.
9158740	9159740	But all I'm saying is,
9159740	9162740	man, what happened when I would have enjoyed that?
9162740	9164740	Star Trek Online though, admittedly,
9164740	9166740	looks like a pretty neat game.
9166740	9167740	Okay, back to the caller.
9167740	9168740	Hi, caller.
9168740	9169740	Hi.
9169740	9174740	Anyway, so about those erotic chats, huh?
9174740	9176740	Yep, he does.
9176740	9178740	What did you call in to ask us about tonight?
9178740	9180740	He just wanted to remind you that you
9180740	9181740	erotically chat, Rob.
9181740	9182740	Oh, sorry.
9182740	9184740	He just wanted to bring up those late night chats
9184740	9185740	live on air.
9185740	9186740	I see how it is.
9186740	9187740	That's fine.
9187740	9188740	How dare you.
9188740	9189740	Let me read some of these transcripts.
9189740	9190740	All right.
9190740	9191740	No, seriously, let the man talk.
9191740	9192740	What's up?
9192740	9195740	No, I wanted to talk about the...
9195740	9197740	God, now I can't even think.
9197740	9199740	Now I got all derailed by the whole chat thing.
9199740	9201740	Yeah, welcome to my life tonight.
9201740	9202740	Welcome to OLR.
9202740	9203740	Jamie was like,
9203740	9205740	hey, Dan should host the show while Loki's gone.
9205740	9206740	I'm like, oh, sure.
9206740	9208740	That sounds like a great idea.
9208740	9210740	I think Dan's doing a great job.
9210740	9211740	Oh, no.
9211740	9212740	Dan's been fun.
9212740	9213740	Dan's fun.
9213740	9214740	Guess what?
9214740	9215740	What?
9215740	9216740	You get the hell out of my house.
9216740	9217740	You can host your story.
9217740	9218740	You can host it from your new car.
9218740	9219740	I don't know.
9219740	9222740	I think Rob could take you, Dan.
9222740	9223740	Yeah.
9223740	9224740	Dream on.
9224740	9225740	I didn't say how.
9225740	9227740	I just said I think you could.
9227740	9229740	Look, I don't even want to go into that conversation.
9229740	9230740	All right.
9230740	9231740	X-Link, hi.
9231740	9232740	This is getting inappropriate.
9232740	9233740	Where every gamer has a voice.
9233740	9238740	So anyways, how about those erotic chats?
9238740	9240740	What about it?
9240740	9244740	I believe you were going to ask something else until you were rudely derailed.
9244740	9246740	Um, no.
9246740	9248740	No, I can't think of what it is now.
9248740	9250740	So I'm just going to leave it at that.
9250740	9251740	All right.
9251740	9252740	Well, have a great week, X-Link.
9252740	9253740	Erotic chats.
9253740	9255740	Thanks for the call, I think.
9255740	9256740	All right.
9256740	9257740	Have a good one.
9257740	9258740	It was good to talk to you.
9258740	9260740	You too.
9260740	9261740	I enjoyed that.
9261740	9266740	He sounded like a good guy.
9266740	9267740	I hate this show.
9267740	9268740	All right.
9268740	9269740	1-8-7.
9269740	9270740	You're loving it.
9270740	9271740	I do love this show.
9271740	9272740	You've got a big smile on your face.
9272740	9273740	I do.
9273740	9274740	This is fun.
9274740	9275740	All right.
9275740	9276740	1-8-7-7 game.
9276740	9277740	O-L-R.
9277740	9278740	username on Skype is orange.
9278740	9279740	But see, now here's the thing, though.
9279740	9284740	When Loki comes back, you guys, you have to say, oh, the show sucked when you weren't
9284740	9285740	there.
9285740	9288740	Like, it just wasn't working without you there.
9288740	9290740	Because I don't want him to feel.
9290740	9291740	You know what's weird, though?
9291740	9292740	The show.
9292740	9293740	He's probably listening to us.
9293740	9294740	You know he's not coming back.
9294740	9297740	The show is always better when one of us is missing.
9297740	9304740	Like, you know Jamie missed episode 69, which was that epic night that Loki sang the karaoke
9304740	9306740	revolution, and it's like one of our greatest movies ever.
9306740	9307740	He sang I'm Staying In.
9307740	9308740	And I was gone.
9308740	9309740	Nice.
9309740	9313740	I was gone one night, and this show just totally, like, I don't even know what happened.
9313740	9319740	Like, they were watching a Ron Jeremy biography live on air and commenting on it.
9319740	9323740	You wait until 378 when we pay all our mad libs.
9323740	9325740	Wait, which episode is it?
9325740	9326740	It will be epic.
9326740	9328740	All right, can we take another call, please?
9328740	9329740	No.
9329740	9330740	Of course.
9330740	9331740	Hi.
9331740	9332740	Who said no?
9332740	9333740	Misty.
9333740	9334740	Misty's the new director.
9334740	9335740	Veto.
9335740	9336740	Producer.
9336740	9337740	I'm taking the call.
9337740	9338740	All right, I'm hanging up.
9338740	9339740	No, I'm kidding.
9339740	9340740	Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio.
9340740	9341740	Who's this?
9341740	9343740	Hi, this is your friendly neighborhood Rick Roller spazzing eater.
9343740	9344740	Hi, spazzing eater.
9344740	9345740	It didn't work.
9345740	9346740	I had the sound off.
9346740	9347740	Haha.
9347740	9348740	What's up?
9348740	9353740	Well, after a couple of years of having that on, I know I kind of relate to the whole Rick
9353740	9356740	Roller thing, but I figured you've got to do it at least once.
9356740	9361740	But at any rate, two little tidbits of information.
9361740	9367740	I probably wonder what you may already know about, but I can't figure you would like to
9367740	9371740	know about since you're really big on the music-based games.
9371740	9382740	From what I've heard through the grapevine, supposedly DDR is coming to both the 360 and
9382740	9385740	PlayStation 3.
9385740	9395740	I don't really follow DDR at all, so I don't know which version of DDR is coming to the
9395740	9404740	other versions, but since I know the two of you are into DDR, I kind of figured the fact
9404740	9409740	that it's coming out to newer systems may pique your interest.
9409740	9413740	Sure, spazzing eater, actually, spazzing eater, I've got the perfect answer to your question
9413740	9417740	actually because we actually have a friend that works at Konami that can actually answer
9417740	9422740	this question and tell us some of the differences between the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3
9422740	9423740	version.
9423740	9425740	So let's head on over to my friend who's going to tell us.
9425740	9426740	That's right, motherfucker.
9426740	9427740	How's it feel?
9427740	9428740	How's it feel?
9428740	9429740	Oh, bitch!
9429740	9430740	What?
9430740	9431740	What?
9431740	9432740	Who's Rick Wall and who now?
9432740	9433740	He's no stranger to love.
9433740	9434740	Yeah, that deserved a Pikachu beatdown.
9434740	9435740	All right.
9435740	9436740	I just got smacked with a Pikachu.
9436740	9437740	All right.
9437740	9438740	I've got troubles on my screen, Rob.
9438740	9439740	Squeeze.
9439740	9440740	Squeeze.
9440740	9441740	Squeeze.
9441740	9442740	Squeeze.
9442740	9443740	Squeeze.
9443740	9444740	Squeeze.
9444740	9445740	Squeeze.
9445740	9446740	Squeeze.
9446740	9447740	Squeeze.
9447740	9448740	Squeeze.
9448740	9449740	Squeeze.
9449740	9450740	Squeeze.
9450740	9451740	Squeeze.
9451740	9453740	I've got troubles on my screen, Rob.
9453740	9454740	Squeeze.
9454740	9456740	When Rob gets smacked with a Pikachu, he usually makes something else.
9456740	9457740	Wait, wait, wait, wait.
9457740	9458740	Where did you put Angus?
9458740	9460740	What the hell are you talking about?
9460740	9461740	Who's Angus?
9461740	9462740	My trouble.
9462740	9463740	It was in the blue bucket.
9463740	9465740	Damn, don't tell me right away about another trouble.
9465740	9466740	Hey, hold on.
9466740	9468740	Angus is in the closet.
9468740	9469740	Hold on.
9469740	9471740	Spazinator actually had a question.
9471740	9473740	I may or may not want to answer it.
9473740	9475740	About what DDR version.
9475740	9476740	Here's the thing, Spazinator.
9476740	9478740	Actually, this is my honest answer.
9478740	9483740	As far as these DDR games go, the new ones that are coming out, we don't know a lot about them, period.
9483740	9494740	That's what makes this press event that's happening this week so interesting is because we had all this information about the Xbox and PlayStation DDRs coming out, and then suddenly there was nothing for a while.
9494740	9501740	But I think what happened is that at E3, then we saw Dance Masters come out, and Dance Masters is a Xbox 360 game.
9501740	9508740	So that the PlayStation 3 users have something, here is my guess, and I honestly believe this is the honest-to-God truth.
9508740	9516740	The game that was going to come out on the 360 and PlayStation 3 now canceled on the 360 in favor of Dance Masters.
9516740	9522740	But for those folks that don't have a 360, you get Dance Dance Revolution on the PlayStation 3.
9522740	9524740	I honestly kind of think that's where things went.
9524740	9530740	And it's really hard to say if this new PlayStation 3 game is going to be good or not until we know more about it.
9530740	9539740	From what we heard a couple years ago, it's like a greatest hits, a lot of the famous songs and some new ones, lots of DLC, eight-panel dancing.
9539740	9547740	It certainly makes it sound like it's going to be leaps and bounds better than the 360 games that already exist, because there is Universe 1, 2, and 3.
9547740	9557740	But I think the PlayStation 3 one, you know, it's the first DDR game, I'm not even acknowledging the Wii ones because they're ridiculous, but it's the first real DDR game we've had in a couple years.
9557740	9563740	And if they've actually rebuilt it from the ground up and so forth, it might be kind of cool. That's my thoughts.
9563740	9575740	Yeah, as someone that's never touched a music game aside from some of the older Guitar Hero games and the Rock Band games, I'm willing to at least give it a try.
9575740	9585740	Granted, I know it's hard core into that series as you guys are, but I'm willing to give anything a try, you know?
9585740	9597740	Faznator, before you go buy DDR on the PlayStation 3, which will cost you at least $60, honestly, if you want to try it and see if you like it, you can find dance games on the PlayStation 1.
9597740	9600740	Because I don't think you have a 360. Do you have a 360?
9600740	9601740	Yeah, I do.
9601740	9607740	Oh, okay, well then never mind. You can go buy a cheap dance pad for like no more than 20 bucks.
9607740	9611740	And you could probably, like Dark Sakura found the fancy dance pads at a local discount store.
9611740	9612740	I bought three of them for six bucks.
9612740	9619740	Yeah, they're like super cheap. So if you look at like discount stores and stuff, you might find them even cheaper, but no more than 20 bucks for a cheap game pad.
9619740	9625740	And like DDR Universe 2 at GameStop, I shit you not, I saw it in a bin the other day, $7 used.
9625740	9640740	So I would say for 27 bucks, try it. And if you think the game is fun and you're like, hey, I want like a more souped up version of this, this is kind of fun, this is getting me moving and burning calories, then drop the 60 bucks on the PlayStation 3.
9640740	9646740	But if you're not sure, Spaznator, don't spend more than 30 bucks doing the trial run.
9646740	9654740	Because you're still getting a decent game out of it. It's not that the 360 games are bad, they're not. They're just, you know, they're dated at this point.
9654740	9666740	Yeah, I'll definitely look into it. It's going to be a while before I buy even a used retail game because money is kind of, you know, tight at the moment.
9666740	9679740	But before I do let you go, there's one more thing I just want to pass along. I don't know if it's on the Xbox marketplace just yet or not.
9679740	9701740	It's been a couple days since I checked it. But at least over on the game side of the PSN store, there is, you know, I guess it amounts to a half hour long machinima movie that Rockstar Games had made using Red Dead Redemption.
9701740	9703740	Interesting.
9703740	9719740	Yeah, totally free download, will cost you a cent. And it clocks in at literally 29 minutes and 6 seconds. I just gave it a brief looking over and it looks kind of decent.
9719740	9731740	You know, if Rockstar is behind it, they have a great writing team, so it's probably pretty good. Especially if it's just a video, I don't see why it's not on the 360. I haven't looked, but I don't see why it wouldn't be there.
9731740	9749740	Yeah, based on the description I read on the video itself towards the end, the half hour movie is supposed to serve as a prequel to the actual game.
9749740	9757740	Alright. Well, Spaznado, we're going to let you go so we can take more calls or wrap the show up. I don't know what we're going to do yet, but have a good one buddy, okay?
9757740	9759740	Yep, you too. Take care.
9759740	9769740	Alright. It was good to not hear a horror story about the Playstation 3 from Spaznado for a week. It was some positive news. He's keeping it positive tonight for you, Dan.
9769740	9771740	He's thinking of playing DDR.
9771740	9774740	Are we going to take more calls? Producer Misty, are we taking more calls or fuck them?
9774740	9776740	I hope so. Depends on who we get though.
9776740	9789740	Alright. Producer Misty says call if you want to try. You have to audition now to be on the show. You have to get through Misty to be on the show.
9789740	9794740	1-877-GAME-OLR. Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
9794740	9797740	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
9797740	9798740	Hey, it's Rama.
9798740	9806740	Hold on, hold on. Before we take your call, Rama. Producer Misty, is there anything you want to make Rama do to see if we can take his call tonight or not?
9806740	9809740	No. I thought that it was him, so he's cool.
9809740	9810740	Take off your pants.
9810740	9811740	Yodel!
9811740	9813740	Eat my terrible cooking.
9813740	9816740	Your cooking isn't terrible.
9816740	9817740	Misty's our Nakane.
9817740	9821740	You have a lovely taco.
9821740	9828740	Mystique is our local fusion of Nabiki and Akane, so she's our Nakane.
9828740	9830740	She agrees.
9830740	9833740	Yeah, you guys are starting to scare the living shit out of me right now.
9833740	9834740	That's alright.
9834740	9835740	Good.
9835740	9836740	God dammit.
9836740	9838740	Wait, you just tuned in, didn't you?
9838740	9841740	Yes, I just tuned in and got rick rolled. I'm like, what the hell?
9841740	9847740	I just want to say, this show, like, yeah.
9847740	9850740	This show has been awesome.
9850740	9852740	I've been doing backflips over the shark all evening.
9852740	9855740	It has much more Dan than any other show has ever had.
9855740	9857740	I mean, really, I'm on the road with...
9857740	9860740	And the promise of Orange on the Road with Mad Libs.
9860740	9863740	I'm on the road with DDR Darla Bill. We're coming back from somewhere.
9863740	9867740	And I get a text from Gio saying that her boobs got nicknames now.
9867740	9873740	I'm fiddling with my phone, trying to get the stream to work with no avail.
9873740	9875740	You're trying to get the stream to work.
9875740	9877740	You know, they make some medicines.
9877740	9879740	Stop it. Stop it right now.
9879740	9882740	Rama, I'm so sorry for Dan.
9882740	9884740	He's met Dan before.
9884740	9886740	Yes, I have.
9886740	9888740	He slept at my house.
9888740	9891740	Dude, Dan just pitched Pikachu.
9891740	9892740	Can we ask what Rama...
9892740	9894740	I've met Rama before too.
9894740	9895740	Yes.
9895740	9897740	Can we ask Rama why he called in tonight?
9897740	9898740	We all know Rama.
9898740	9899740	Instead of consistently derailing this call.
9899740	9900740	Yes, Rama?
9900740	9906740	I didn't have much to contribute except for the fact that DJ Hero bundles are now 40 bucks at Best Buy.
9906740	9907740	Sweet.
9907740	9909740	Now they'll sell a million more.
9909740	9912740	I went online earlier this morning and ordered mine.
9912740	9918740	And I went to check other places because it seems that Kmart was the first one to do when I was trying to get a price match.
9918740	9919740	But Best Buy has it.
9919740	9926740	But I find it funny that GameStop is selling their bundles for $49.99 online only in stores still 100 bucks.
9926740	9928740	On related news to that.
9928740	9931740	This is a great example of how failed the PS3 is.
9931740	9940740	At Fry's, the Super Deluxe Logitech Guitar Hero controllers. The drum and the guitar. 50 bucks a piece.
9940740	9941740	Wow.
9941740	9942740	So I'm looking at that.
9942740	9943740	Are you serious?
9943740	9944740	Yes, because those are $200 controllers.
9944740	9947740	I'm looking at that and I'm like, if they have $360 ones, they're bought.
9947740	9948740	They are bought.
9948740	9951740	Find the $360 ones, they're still $200 bucks.
9951740	9958740	Because honestly, not for nothing, I would drop $200 bucks on the Logitech ones instead of buying the Mad Catz ones.
9958740	9962740	I don't care what anyone says. Mad Catz controllers and accessories are pieces of shit.
9962740	9963740	You don't say.
9963740	9966740	Frisbee in our chatroom says Toys R Us is at 40 bucks as well.
9966740	9968740	Their Street Fighter stakes are pretty nice.
9968740	9976740	I will say though guys, if you're at all interested in DJ Hero 2, now's the time to go get your controller.
9976740	9977740	Yeah.
9977740	9980740	And get practically a free DJ Hero 1 with it.
9980740	9981740	Yeah.
9981740	9983740	There you go. Yeah.
9983740	9984740	Yeah.
9984740	9988740	Or if you're smart, you buy two bundles and you trade them in one game.
9988740	9989740	I'm not smart.
9989740	9991740	I just went cross-eyed.
9991740	9992740	All right.
9992740	9994740	Rama, thanks so much for your call, buddy.
9994740	9996740	Anything else you want to share quickly tonight?
9996740	9998740	No, that's it.
9998740	9999740	All right. Bye.
9999740	10000740	Peace.
10000740	10001740	All right.
10001740	10002740	All right.
10002740	10004740	I think that's going to do it for phone calls tonight, guys.
10004740	10005740	We got to wrap up.
10005740	10006740	I'm glad Rama called.
10006740	10007740	I was hoping for him to call.
10007740	10008740	I'm looking at Baby.
10008740	10010740	Apparently he wasn't really listening most of the night.
10010740	10011740	Baby.
10011740	10012740	Baby.
10012740	10013740	Baby.
10013740	10015740	That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Laundry.
10015740	10016740	Do we have any last minutes?
10016740	10017740	Baby.
10017740	10018740	Loki's Baby, I know.
10018740	10019740	Baby.
10019740	10020740	You can post that in chat.
10020740	10021740	It's a public blog.
10021740	10022740	Okay.
10022740	10023740	Yeah.
10023740	10024740	It is adorable.
10024740	10025740	Actually, I think a picture of Nellie and Baby is on orangelaundry.com.
10025740	10027740	Like in the little flicker thingy at the top.
10027740	10028740	I think so.
10028740	10029740	Yeah.
10029740	10030740	So check it out if you want to see the Baby.
10030740	10031740	All right.
10031740	10032740	That's going to do it.
10032740	10033740	That looks like a baby.
10033740	10034740	We're wrapping up tonight's show.
10034740	10035740	Do we have any last minute stories?
10035740	10038740	Any last minute video game news stories you wanted to talk about?
10038740	10039740	Not really.
10039740	10040740	Dan?
10040740	10041740	I like video games.
10041740	10042740	I know.
10042740	10044740	But, you know, are we doing an after birth raw?
10044740	10046740	Because we really don't do cage match or anything.
10046740	10047740	We'll do a quick after birth.
10047740	10048740	Okay.
10048740	10049740	All right.
10049740	10050740	It'll be more of a still birth.
10050740	10051740	All right.
10051740	10052740	I will take four chat room FUs.
10052740	10053740	All right.
10053740	10054740	How's that?
10054740	10055740	Fus.
10055740	10056740	But we got to wrap up the actual podcast part of the show.
10056740	10057740	That's it.
10057740	10058740	We're done.
10058740	10059740	We're out of here.
10059740	10060740	Good night.
10060740	10062740	I have to go around the room, though, and say before I got to say goodbye to our guests.
10062740	10064740	Misty, thank you so much for being here.
10064740	10065740	We hope it was fun.
10065740	10068740	You picked a hell of a show to attend, I got to say.
10068740	10071740	Any episode would have been more epic with me visiting.
10071740	10073740	And she's so humble.
10073740	10074740	Exactly.
10074740	10075740	All right.
10075740	10078740	Well, you have a safe trip back, and we'll come back again soon.
10078740	10079740	See us real soon.
10079740	10080740	All right.
10080740	10082740	We're canceling the show because you're not here next week.
10082740	10083740	Just so you know.
10083740	10084740	Oh, that's the reason.
10084740	10087740	So all the listeners that are upset there's no show next week, you need to blame Misty.
10087740	10089740	Hey, you told me how to start a show, so it's happening.
10089740	10091740	Dan, the man.
10091740	10094740	Oh, actually, I got to say, before we go to Dan, Misty, do you have any final thoughts
10094740	10095740	for our listeners tonight?
10095740	10099740	If I had to pick a theme song for this week, it would probably be the Nickelback song,
10099740	10100740	Burn It to the Ground.
10100740	10103740	Nickelback is not allowed to be associated with this program.
10103740	10104740	That's what I tried to tell her.
10104740	10105740	Shut the hell up.
10105740	10106740	All right.
10106740	10107740	You should hope.
10107740	10108740	How many times am I going to tell you that?
10108740	10109740	Dan.
10109740	10111740	Oh, I'll do Mystique.
10111740	10112740	All right.
10112740	10117740	Mystique, thank you for, I don't know really what you did here tonight, but thank you for
10117740	10118740	the tacos, actually.
10118740	10119740	They were amazing.
10119740	10121740	I told you I was going to give you some of my meat.
10121740	10122740	All right.
10122740	10123740	It was delicious.
10123740	10125740	Mystique, do you have anything you want to say to listeners?
10125740	10127740	Any final thoughts?
10127740	10130740	If you want to marry me, you better fork over something valuable.
10130740	10132740	There you go.
10132740	10134740	I got a dollar.
10134740	10135740	All right.
10135740	10139740	Dan, sir, thank you so much for being on the show tonight.
10139740	10142740	Orange Lounge Radio, starring Dan.
10142740	10147740	Despite all the bashing and fun making fun of you, you've been hilarious tonight.
10147740	10149740	You've been making fun of me.
10149740	10150740	I mean-
10150740	10151740	Sounds like you're opposing me, Rob.
10151740	10152740	No, I'm not opposing you.
10152740	10154740	I already told you what happened to people who oppose me.
10154740	10156740	But you've actually been hilarious, and I know the listeners love you.
10156740	10158740	So thank you very much for being here tonight.
10158740	10159740	That's what I do.
10159740	10160740	We'll maybe see you again in a couple weeks.
10160740	10161740	Apparently I'll be back in two weeks.
10161740	10162740	Apparently.
10162740	10163740	It depends on Matt.
10163740	10164740	I don't know what's going to happen.
10164740	10165740	So we'll see.
10165740	10166740	But even if-
10166740	10167740	As long as there's no Matt and I have nothing better to do-
10167740	10168740	Even if Matt is here-
10168740	10169740	I'll be back.
10169740	10172740	Even if Matt is here, I'm sure we would all love it if you'd at least drop in.
10172740	10173740	Kind of do the Mystique thing.
10173740	10174740	Run in the room, say something, and run away.
10174740	10176740	I just like sitting at my own desk.
10176740	10177740	All right.
10177740	10178740	It's good, isn't it?
10178740	10180740	Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight, Dan?
10180740	10181740	No, not really.
10181740	10182740	Okay.
10182740	10183740	People from Sweden sound funny.
10183740	10186740	All right.
10186740	10187740	And it's like, really?
10187740	10188740	Old news.
10188740	10189740	That was awesome.
10189740	10190740	Totally old news.
10190740	10191740	All right.
10191740	10192740	I'll save Dark Sakura for last, because she likes to have the final, final word.
10192740	10197740	My final thought is, I don't know what my final thought is.
10197740	10201740	I just, I'm in a better mood now than I was when I got here.
10201740	10203740	You have a hot dog twitched your boobs.
10203740	10204740	I do.
10204740	10206740	I have a hot dog shirt on.
10206740	10207740	And that's it.
10207740	10208740	Dark Sakura.
10208740	10209740	I won!
10209740	10210740	Thank you.

10239740	10240740	So we'll see you...
10240740	10241740	Rob, unnecessary prefix.
10241740	10242740	You know what?
10242740	10243740	We'll...
10243740	10245740	Shut the hell up.
10245740	10246740	You know what?
10246740	10247740	This is my house.
