9226	23731	DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki Tonight, August 8th, 2010 Connect may not be available for indie games Soon you can play video games with your eyes And a warning for all StarCraft II players
31468	37753	Hello my friends and welcome to episode number 377 of Orange Lounge Radio.
37833	41216	We are that video game talk show where every gamer has a voice.
41557	50865	My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host, the one and only, knocking stuff over, she reaches for her mic, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
51725	52246	How you doing?
53387	54448	Why are you so angry?
55008	55749	Why are you mad though?
56089	62791	Because I made a boo-boo and this thing is trying to... I'm trying to get rid of this stupid thing.
62831	63652	You made a boo-boo?
63712	65932	Please, let's revel in what mistakes you've made.
68533	73795	I got that My Security Shield thing because I hit space...
75635	79536	So my security shield, is that one of those spammy spam spammers programs?
79796	84878	It's called a rogue anti-spyware when it's really the worst kind of spyware there is.
85058	88719	So it's spyware disguised as anti-spyware.
88939	91080	It's the type of thing my mom would have all over her computer.
91660	94321	Yeah, and I'm trying to get rid of it without having to reboot.
94941	99106	So, word of warning to those folks out there, watch what you hit the space bar on.
99126	99587	I know, right?
99627	101569	Just because it looks like your windows doesn't mean it's right.
102030	107517	And I was actually right in the middle of typing to somebody on AIM when it popped up.
107717	108258	I hate that.
108859	110661	Because I use the space bar for everything.
110821	111362	Right, of course.
112483	113404	Dan the Man
137998	138238	Of course.
138258	138458	Of course.
166617	168740	I just had to throw him a curveball.
169020	173686	Dan is going to be helping out while Loki's on vacation because it's really easy for Dan to help out because he lives here.
174447	176269	He's usually pretty readily available.
177050	185320	Dan will be filling in until Loki decides he's going to come back, which I hope he does decide to come back at some point because there's that part of me that's always wondered.
186101	190142	You know, when Loki has this baby, is he going to want to do a little radio show on the internet anymore?
191042	194563	Or is he going to worry that the stuff he says on this show his kid might hear someday?
194663	195084	I don't know.
195844	197464	That would be awfully pathetic.
198425	202466	No, I'm positive he will come back, but he can take all the time he needs.
202906	203146	Alright.
204006	210490	Well, we'll get back to Dan in a little while, but I want to introduce somebody else to you guys because we have a guest in studio tonight, too.
210990	212371	And we're really glad to have her.
212771	219595	It's the second time she's been on the show, and she probably would be one of the few guests that come.
220035	225178	I can only think of maybe like two or three guests that have traveled further than she has to be on the show.
225558	227459	Say hello, everybody, to Misty is here tonight.
228989	229730	How you doing, Misty?
229950	230550	I'm doing good.
230770	231590	Alright, excellent.
231971	235632	So, um, let's see, for those that haven't, when was the last time you were on the show?
235653	236913	It was about a year ago-ish?
237353	246358	No, due to stuff happening last time, we never even got to do a pre-tape segment, so this is my first time, just my second time being in Dan and Jamie's house.
246598	248179	I thought for some reason you were on a show.
248299	251260	Oh, you did, we did like a pre-tape thing or something, huh?
251520	252821	We didn't even get to that last time.
252881	253121	Really?
253441	253681	Really.
253761	255302	I thought you should have been on a show before.
255582	256083	Yeah, Rob.
257003	257483	Yeah.
257583	261726	Well, okay, after 377 episodes, they all start to blur a little bit, okay?
261746	262266	Give me a break.
262646	267969	All right, well, anyway, well, then welcome to the show at BSMA, but you've called in before and all that good stuff, so hopefully the listeners know you.
268409	284197	And also, a lot of listeners may have not heard you because you don't call in every week, but you have a presence on the website, and you've been following the Twitters, and I know you've always been a big supporter of the show, so thank you, first off, for being such a supporter of OLR over the years.
284237	285178	When did you first start listening?
285218	285838	It's been a while, right?
286457	286817	Episode 91.
287638	289278	Wow, that's some time ago.
289778	291359	All right.
291999	294240	What is the best thing about Orange Lawn Tradio, you think?
294480	296221	Just to inflate our egos a little bit.
297762	301843	Again, it's back more toward the DDR and random days.
302964	306365	Of course, the tangents that pop up now still make it worth it.
306840	318129	You know, I've kind of heard that, that even though we're not a music-based game show anymore, kind of like the community that still lives on because of that, I've definitely heard is like a thing that people like about the show.
318609	328297	And certainly, you know, as much as I've hated on a lot of the recent games that that same company's put out that gave us DDR, obviously the show wouldn't exist if it weren't for that.
328397	330198	And for that, I will always be thankful.
330278	336043	And there'll always be a part of me that wants to play those games as crappy as they are these days.
336423	348907	Alright, anyhow, so Misty will be joining us and we'll talk to her a little more a little later, but we're going to get into a little bit of how was your gaming week, because we always start off the show talking about our gaming weeks and what we've been playing, so let's go over to DarkSakura.
349847	353409	What have you been playing besides Download, Adaware, and Spybot as quickly as possible?
354829	364132	It's, um, well, I played some Ragnarok and Star Trek Online, as usual, and then I made Dan play stuff for me so I could watch.
366314	367575	Oh, that's right.
367595	368796	You still have the hand thing going on.
368816	370677	But it's not seeping joint fluid anymore.
370737	373079	Yeah, actually, I can stand to look at it now.
373139	374920	I get very squeamish with the whole blood thing.
375340	376161	I don't want to touch it.
376641	377482	I don't want to touch it.
377542	378782	Touch it, touch it, touch it.
378802	378863	Why?
379043	380043	Because it's not gross.
382025	384006	I meant the side of the hole, not the hole.
384266	384906	Oh, I touched the hole.
384926	385907	Rob touched the hole.
386567	387468	I touched Jamie's hole.
387508	387888	Sorry, Dan.
388249	388509	All right.
388749	390710	No problem.
392411	392651	All right.
392751	393352	Oh, Rob.
396531	398392	At least the hole's in your hand and not in your head.
400933	404515	Dan played the games for me so that I could watch and then go, what?
404936	406997	Alright, well Dan, we'll skip on over to you.
407237	408597	What kind of games have you been playing this week?
409258	412580	I've been playing Hydra Thunder Hurricane, which is awesome.
412940	413740	Why is it awesome?
413760	417202	Because I downloaded it and I was like, this just isn't the same.
417222	419303	Because I love jet boat racing.
419964	422485	I don't understand why, but it's awesome.
423444	429966	I can, like, jump my boat, break things, win races, go online, get my ass kicked.
430627	431207	It's amazing.
431787	434788	Why is it that everybody online is better than me?
435188	436449	Like, I can't figure this out.
436489	438209	Like, it doesn't matter what game I play.
438609	439970	And is it just me, guys?
440270	444011	Whenever I go online and play a game online, I am always in last place.
444151	451054	Unless... It's not... See, she didn't have a mic, so...
453435	457458	That's the way Mystique works.
457638	460740	Stop it.
460780	461840	We're doing a radio show.
462421	463221	She doesn't care.
463862	469445	Dan and Jamie's friend, Mystique, she's funny and she ran in here and just whispered.
469925	470966	I said, why do I always come in last?
471006	473488	She just came in here and whispered, it's because you're gay.
473568	475309	And that's why everybody started laughing.
475851	486277	And then she came in here and gave the thumbs up So anyway We gotta get a wireless mic for Mystique So that way when she runs in and out we'll still get her Anyway Where was I?
486357	498083	See now I got lost Thanks Mystique for derailing the whole goddamn show We're talking about my gaming week And you decided to lament the fact that you suck at games online Yes I suck at video games online Why is it Halo last place?
498804	502686	I would think partially Because the only game I'll typically play online is Rock Band 2
504145	505425	I do okay with the music games.
505505	509626	DDR, like Ultramix back in the day, I would kick your ass at Ultramix.
509706	509966	I will.
510646	514167	But there were some very scary people that could even beat me, but that's one of the few.
515067	516408	But like, okay, Blur.
516548	517208	Have you played Blur?
517628	518368	The online racing game?
518388	519988	Have you played it online at all against other people?
520229	520449	No.
520809	526330	Usually I do really shitty, but one time, one time, I actually won a race.
527270	544900	I won a race against like 10 other people and I was so excited I'll admit, I felt a little tingle down there I was so excited Wow And that's like the only time that's ever happened Alright And that new downloadable Castlevania How is the new downloadable Castlevania?
545141	555867	Well, I only played the trial So, uh, it's interesting It seems like it'd probably be really cool with a crew of people, but by yourself not very fun
556471	559987	I've heard it's an awesome multiplayer game but I have yet to experience the multiplayer.
560731	561394	Did you download it?
562023	590358	I checked out the demo for a little bit and I played it at E3 a few months ago and when I was at E3 I was like this game's kind of weird but it's kind of interesting and fun and when I downloaded it I was like yeah this is still kind of weird like I just the thing I don't like about the game and I don't like games that do this is that the game really just throws you in with no description whatsoever and look guys I realize most Atari 2600 games and NES games back in the day did the same thing
590838	592719	Mario doesn't tell you what to do.
593199	595500	But games were less complicated back then.
597562	598322	It takes a second.
598802	600303	And there's so many buttons and stuff.
600443	605185	Usually I need a little bit of a tutorial, but all I see in Castlevania is Boss.
605806	609468	And I'm like, okay, I'll go do that.
609508	613430	But then every time I think I know the way to the boss, there's a fucking wall there or something.
613450	615611	I'm like, why didn't I see that when I was looking at the whole map?
615891	618632	It seems to be my new four people who are going to download it.
619272	620093	It'd be worth my money.
621074	622376	Is it $15?
622476	622677	It is $15.
624199	625020	That's where it's at now.
625060	627064	If it was $10, it would be almost an automatic anyway.
627364	635517	The $15 thing, except for a game like Hurricane, which is obviously an undertaking, it seems to me like that's a little excessive for Castlevania.
636314	639216	Alright, I'm going to go to the chat room because chat rooms are filling up with comments here.
639276	644459	Chat.OrangeLawnsRadio.com We love our chatters and every week they join us here.
644860	645220	Let's see.
645560	649723	Tiger Claw is going to start us off tonight saying in response to the why do I always lose online.
650123	650964	Sky, it's simple.
650984	652765	They've been playing the game a whole lot.
652965	656187	If you're someone who plays casual, you'll get your ass kicked online.
657128	657688	Yeah, pretty much.
657948	662932	He also goes on to say I haven't played StarCraft 2 online yet knowing I'll just get my ass whooped.
663232	665994	I want to play it online but only doing co-op games.
666574	682724	it's kind of how I feel about a lot of that stuff too but yet I play World of Warcraft and I actually really enjoy PvP and World of Warcraft but that's, World of Warcraft's like not like other games it's really not, games like that their MMOs are in a little bubble of their own they're not like other stuff
683264	687165	Leo Shen in our chat says, Rob, try BlazBlue, BlazeBlue, whatever you want to say, CS.
687565	690206	They have a beginner mode that works with online mode.
690226	691827	You can button mash your way to victory.
692887	693487	Sounds good to me.
694167	694508	There you go.
694768	703310	And AmazeSatsuma... AmazeSatsuma chimes in and says, the new Castlevania does have a good multiplayer game.
704371	706071	There you go.
707792	708092	Hello.
708212	708432	Hi.
708492	708572	Hi.
710376	710896	and your mic.
710936	712056	Now your mic is ruined again.
712596	713697	How about this?
713717	714897	Yeah, we're good.
714997	721078	I was explaining to Dan why we can't have more than three people in the chat room because the moment number four pops in, boot.
721318	722358	Is Misty on 3G though?
722418	722958	Are you on 3G?
723459	724259	No, I'm on Wi-Fi.
724419	726079	Can you switch to 3G or will your app stop working?
726779	727959	It's all Wi-Fi for mine.
727979	729620	Remember, I have no fancy iPhone.
730120	730560	Oh, that's right.
730580	731900	You have an iPhone.
732240	733440	It looks like an iPhone.
733861	734161	All right.
734461	734761	That's right.
734781	735061	I'll live.
735601	735841	All right.
737202	738203	Dan, you can look over here.
738283	740383	It's always there.
740563	744945	Anyway, chat.orangeentree.com if you want to chat with the host, except for Dan because he can't get in.
745705	746426	Screw you people.
747106	747706	You have a mic.
747726	748706	Why do you need IRC?
749847	750927	So I can see what people are saying.
751087	752828	He wants to know when people are talking shit about him.
752968	755129	If people are talking shit, I'll let you know.
756129	756950	Holy crap.
757431	757972	You okay there?
758472	761957	Oh, I was running Hijack This to see if I could find it, but there's way too many things that are running.
762538	763459	Jamie's computer is super broken.
763479	768666	Jamie has downloaded like seven anti-spyware programs since the time I sat down in this chair.
768706	770608	I just downloaded Hijack This and Attaware.
770849	772431	Because... But I haven't rebooted.
772571	773251	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
798448	800229	But no!
800789	807393	For the record, I was going to a site that explained the history of gay people in the Old Testament.
807754	808234	Porn!
810855	812656	I don't know why you're giving her shit about it, Dan.
812676	813597	You made her download it.
813977	816839	I wanted to read the article and instead it did this shit to me.
817599	819300	I was trying to be conscientious!
820421	821902	I get my porn from other websites.
822282	823643	I get my porn from kicking you.
825244	827405	Alright, anything else that you played this week, Dan?
828633	832738	I played a bunch of Genesis games because my wife was like, play Genesis games.
832798	834379	Yeah, I heard there was Sega Night last night.
834600	835801	Yeah, I don't know.
836221	842308	All I know is Jamie wanted me to get beat because she picked every one of the hardest Genesis games and was like, play this, play this.
842748	844290	Finally, she goes back for another batch of games.
844310	846752	I'm like, if she comes back with Gunstar Heroes, I'm going to shoot her.
847593	849075	And she came back with Gunstar Heroes.
850450	853054	What was the other game that I brought?
854617	856099	I don't remember what the other one was.
856439	858002	Oh, no, it wasn't Midnight Resistance.
858062	858302	It was...
860225	861085	Something else difficult.
861546	865468	But the games that I brought out were, well, there was Robo Aleste and Sylphied.
865488	866428	Every freaking game.
866528	874172	Yeah, Sylphied, Robo Aleste, Shadow Dancer, Strider, which is normally a game that I would just dominate without even thinking about it.
874232	879115	And tonight, or last night, every cheap death, I was like, son of a bitch.
879515	881436	Oh, terrible stuff.
881456	884477	Didn't you beat Strider with your eyes closed once or something crazy?
884898	887459	I've beaten Strider every which way.
889039	893560	Seriously, and last night, like I said, I continued three times, didn't finish the game.
894140	897621	I was just like, alright, that's plenty of that.
899242	904924	For the record, it was two stages that I beat with my eyes closed.
906444	908244	I have no idea what you're talking about.
908625	910965	Well, when I was a kid, I could beat 8-1 on Super Mario Bros.
911005	913506	with my eyes closed because I had the level timed.
915761	920703	I could get through 8-1 without stopping, but I couldn't do it with my eyes closed.
920763	922824	But I could do it continuously running through the whole thing.
923464	924364	I couldn't do that anymore.
925345	928846	I can still get through it running, it's just I can't do it blindfolded anymore because I don't remember the timing.
932529	935852	I want to know what crazy accomplishments our chatters have accomplished in video games.
935912	937773	Like weird shit.
937914	939215	Like you beat a game.
939295	939935	Okay, great.
939975	940976	Yeah, we all beat games.
941317	947202	I want to know you beat a game while hanging upside down, getting water shot at your face or something.
947662	950685	I want to know what crazy video game accomplishments you guys have done.
951065	951926	That would be fun to know about.
952486	956288	Alright, in the meantime, I'll talk about my gaming week, which actually was kind of non-existent.
956308	958089	I think I pretty much hit on everything I played this week.
958409	964532	I had a really busy week, so I didn't get a lot done, and I really didn't get a lot done with the podcast, so I apologize for that.
964552	965313	I'll talk about that in a minute.
965673	969695	But I didn't play a lot outside of Warcraft.
969755	972417	I'll give you guys a Warcraft update, for those that care, all two of you.
972437	972837	Woo!
973297	973657	Shut up.
974877	976578	Our guild is now in Icecrown Citadel.
976598	984219	Because remember, our guild is about six months behind all the other guilds because we didn't start raiding until about six weeks ago, probably, at this point.
984599	985780	We're now in Icecrown Citadel.
985820	987160	You were raiding, but it wasn't lairs.
988480	992461	We're in Icecrown Citadel now, and we took out the fourth boss, Sourfang.
992821	994121	And that's how far we are right now.
994202	995102	Sourfang.
995142	996222	Sourfang.
996362	1000843	Oh, I was like, if it's Sourfang, that guy had to be like... It's with you, it's not no.
1001961	1007585	I was saying if it was Sour, then I'd be like, okay, what's going to be my fear-instilling nickname?
1008466	1012929	Well, he got Bloodfang, and this one got Evilfang, and this one's Darkfang.
1012969	1014311	I guess I'll go with Sour.
1015491	1016312	Sourfang.
1016392	1017013	Sour.
1017033	1018134	It's not like Sourfang.
1018194	1018894	Sourfang.
1018934	1019715	Sour.
1019815	1020636	That sounds like a dog.
1020916	1021697	Sour.
1022037	1022337	All right.
1023118	1025239	So, yeah, that was the ICC accomplishments.
1025740	1027381	I am on number four, by the way.
1027641	1028342	Number four, Bloodfang.
1029105	1035868	Removal Program Number 4 The AVG's good It's all the stuff that I should have put on here to begin with So you know what the problem with this whole thing is?
1035988	1049835	I'm gonna have to fix your computer The fuck you will I fixed your computer when you had that stupid thing that kept popping up You remember that one registry thing that would keep replicating itself every time you deleted the registry file unless you removed yourself from the internet?
1049975	1051876	No, because I really try not to get that shit on my computer
1052768	1053509	Everybody got it.
1053909	1054970	And I removed it off Dan's.
1055371	1056532	I have no idea what you're talking about.
1056552	1058454	I just had a video card explode on me once.
1058494	1064260	That was really... I don't get a lot of... Well, my WoW account got hacked about... When was it?
1064280	1066101	It was when I was in Disneyland October.
1066121	1067843	So it was about almost a year ago now.
1068324	1069285	My WoW account... Shut up.
1069585	1070806	No, that was a really long time ago.
1071807	1073468	My WoW account got hacked.
1073588	1075610	And I was like, how the hell did that happen?
1075930	1077011	Did somebody get my password?
1077271	1079512	What kind of keylogger got on my computer?
1079552	1080473	Who else has my password?
1080493	1081273	And then I figured it out.
1081313	1084555	You know how I am pretty convinced somebody got my Warcraft password?
1085116	1088998	Because I used to play on my ex's computer and he was dumb enough to get all that spyware stuff.
1089058	1094362	So that's how they got my password because I made the mistake of playing on someone else's computer and didn't know better.
1095942	1096843	Word of warning, everybody.
1096863	1100366	Do you think that I've already uninstalled World of Warcraft from my computer?
1100827	1104210	Even though I probably won't ever play it again, I don't want them to get my account.
1104591	1106933	Because they would have stole your World of Warcraft account.
1107393	1109716	They would have stole all the gold Rob gave me.
1110416	1115541	Oh, while I'm X-bashing here on the show, can I tell you something else I realized?
1115601	1115982	Which one?
1116002	1117243	It actually has to do with gaming.
1118264	1118965	You know which one.
1119005	1119305	The one...
1122177	1122297	Oh!
1122317	1123077	I mouthed it off air.
1124178	1124738	Oh, yes.
1124898	1128359	Because I don't want to, you know, do slanderous or anything.
1128399	1129460	But no, here's the thing.
1129540	1132621	I actually realized this today while I was driving down listening to another podcast.
1132961	1138303	You know how I've been really afraid to play StarCraft 2 because I think it's too hard and I'm not really good at RTS games.
1138343	1141684	I'm really worried that the game is not... Like, I'm not going to be able to do well at the game.
1142264	1146085	Well, I realized that my ex was a big StarCraft fan.
1146345	1150427	Like, he actually... His online name was actually based out of the StarCraft universe and everything and it really hit me.
1150467	1150847	I was like...
1151707	1165386	if that dumb fuck can play StarCraft I can play StarCraft so I'm gonna go out and buy StarCraft 2 tomorrow I'm Jim Raynor 1262 hardcore StarCraft fan well you were still supposed to bring me something Rob
1166887	1168608	Oh, Final Fantasy XIII, yes.
1168728	1170069	I haven't been home.
1170089	1171450	I haven't been home.
1171510	1175992	If you put it on the easiest setting, by the way, StarCraft II is, like, hyper easy.
1176352	1176792	Is it really?
1176933	1180114	It's like two enemy soldiers come out and you're just like, die!
1180234	1180515	That's good.
1180735	1189920	Blackwolf, our good pal who does the show before us here at All Games Radio, which, by the way, I don't remember if I said this, but we do tape live every week at www.allgames.com right after Bobby Blackwolf's show.
1190980	1193962	Bobby Blackwolf says casual mode is reasonable, Rob.
1194502	1195483	So, there you go.
1195503	1196043	I guess that's cool.
1196397	1197218	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1211220	1211740	It's too much.
1212241	1213482	I'm weird, you guys.
1213602	1214822	Are you seeing this?
1215023	1216484	I don't play a lot of RTSs yet.
1216504	1217364	This thing is amazing.
1217484	1219245	Yeah, Jamie got that out when you were gone last week.
1219526	1222488	I was thumbing through it, and I turned everything upside down and put it back.
1222828	1223208	Sweet.
1223308	1224209	All right.
1224269	1224669	Let's see.
1224689	1237558	I was asking for gaming accomplishments, and I didn't see a lot, but I do see SalaciousPop in our chat room says, I got up to stage five in Battletoads on one set of lives once.
1238098	1238238	Once.
1238378	1239239	That's an accomplishment.
1239259	1239979	That is an accomplishment.
1240119	1241000	Also, oh, wow.
1242142	1248297	Also, I beat the original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles NES game twice with all four turtles alive.
1249220	1250002	That's pretty hardcore.
1251244	1253025	I had my first Rage Quit, Rob!
1279824	1280405	Rage quit.
1280605	1280946	In what?
1281006	1281847	In Star Trek Online.
1282027	1282308	Really?
1282548	1283690	Because my ship got blewed up.
1284070	1285132	And I was like, fuck this.
1285592	1285953	Exit.
1286854	1288737	I rage quit playing Genesis games last night.
1290019	1290299	All right.
1290860	1291781	I got to ask Misty.
1291941	1293724	Misty, I don't want to neglect you and your gaming week.
1293764	1294365	How was your gaming week?
1295188	1298710	Don't forget to talk in that mic on, or we can't hear you.
1314119	1315440	But basically non-existent.
1315600	1316401	Rock Band 2.
1317122	1319564	Bought some stupid Rainbow Unicorn game.
1319604	1320244	I blame Rob.
1320605	1321846	Rainbow Unicorn game is awesome.
1322266	1323647	Robot Unicorn Attack on iPhone.
1323807	1327630	What about the one where you get ass, is it?
1327731	1328351	Pink anus.
1328511	1329432	Pink anus.
1329452	1330153	That's on Steam.
1330313	1331113	I have that game.
1331354	1331794	I know you do.
1331994	1332274	Really?
1332935	1333636	Yes.
1333916	1336118	There's a unicorn game and there's a...
1336698	1338520	How many times have I told the story on this show already?
1338720	1344184	There's a mineral or something that you use to, like, I don't know, perfect your unicorns, polish their horns, we'll say.
1346486	1347126	It's anus.
1347406	1348607	A-E-N-U-S.
1349448	1352390	So you collect pink anus to polish their horns, basically.
1352951	1353331	I knew that.
1353371	1354272	I just wanted to hear you say it.
1354372	1354852	Okay.
1356914	1357594	Alright, anyway.
1360657	1362518	Alright, anything else for your gaming week, Misty?
1364119	1364660	Not really.
1365973	1368301	And by the way, you took a flight out here for the first time, right?
1368321	1369405	Wasn't this your first time flying?
1369425	1370188	Yes, it was.
1370268	1371071	How was it?
1371151	1371733	Was it that bad?
1373811	1377372	Surprisingly, the only time I was really that nervous was during takeoff.
1377392	1381013	Alright, and then once you got in the air, you just took a Valium and everything was okay?
1381053	1382693	No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
1382733	1385514	No, I had drugs in case I needed them, though.
1386775	1388035	Just in case, some standby.
1388375	1390596	Yep, but no, it wasn't too bad.
1391516	1399598	Hell, by about the time we got over the Grand Canyon, I was even kind of getting to the point where I could look out the window for more than half a second before having to look away.
1400427	1401708	Oh, but looking out the window is great.
1401728	1403990	Actually, I like going over lakes and taking pictures of them.
1405191	1414238	I like flying JetBlue or Frontier or any airline that has the television in the seat in front of me because then I just... And I literally did this once.
1414299	1420864	I was on a flight to New York, which is about five and a half hours from SAC or SF, and I watched SpongeBob SquarePants the entire way.
1420884	1422025	And it was the best flight I ever took.
1422405	1424087	I didn't have to think about the takeoff.
1424467	1428871	I mean, yeah, it's noisy, but otherwise it was like, you know, SpongeBob SquarePants.
1429031	1429271	Anyway.
1429764	1434046	Oh, but you bet I whipped out my iPod as soon as they announced that we had reached cruising altitude.
1434706	1437367	And even then I didn't buy the book I bought through the Kindle app.
1438847	1439367	Isn't that funny?
1439387	1441888	You'll bring all this shit and you're like, yeah, I'm gonna watch a movie on the plane.
1441908	1443189	I'm gonna play this game.
1443269	1444589	And then, like, you just fall asleep.
1445350	1446210	At least that's what I do.
1446721	1452346	Well, there's more attention span for me, but that is part of the reason I made it a point not to pack any physical books.
1452426	1457551	Just my iPod and a notebook for writing up my ghetto blog, mainly.
1457872	1467641	I really like having my netbook because since I have an 8-hour battery on it, I can just watch movies and Doctor Who and stuff the entire time.
1468686	1470606	I'll tell you what I still do on planes.
1470766	1471767	And this is old school.
1472527	1476687	Back in my day, before we had a Game Boy, this is what we did, okay?
1477988	1479648	And still, to this day, I like to do this.
1480368	1482348	You know those variety games books?
1482428	1486169	They're like the penny press variety crossword puzzles in games.
1486189	1491410	They have the crosswords and the anagram puzzles and the logic puzzles and all those.
1491770	1493750	Surely someone in chat knows what I'm talking about.
1494271	1496171	I will buy one of those books at the...
1497071	1497251	Mad Libs
1523766	1524826	Mad Libs are great.
1524886	1525787	Mad Libs rule.
1526147	1527907	Especially loud Mad Libs.
1527927	1528367	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1528647	1539890	If you guys are all sitting a bunch of seats apart, and it's all your coworkers or your friends, and everyone on the plane is really, really annoyed with you guys already, start doing some Mad Libs.
1540430	1541010	Oh, my God.
1541411	1543051	It's the most fun you could possibly have.
1543211	1555955	But Dan, keep in mind that when I do travel, it's usually alone and I'm, unless I'm like with you, Rob and Jamie, I'm not particularly social on my method of travel.
1556115	1557696	Do Mad Libs with the people next to you.
1557896	1561477	Or do Mad Libs by yourself.
1561497	1563077	You can do Mad Libs by yourself.
1563097	1568179	Just turn to the person next to you, scary hobo, psycho killer, housewife, whatever, and say, hey.
1568933	1570154	You want to throw down some ad libs?
1571256	1573458	If they say no, sit next to someone else.
1573558	1574219	Excuse me, ma'am.
1574399	1574740	Excuse me.
1574780	1575561	Excuse me, ma'am.
1575821	1576061	Ma'am.
1576522	1576722	Ma'am.
1576882	1577143	Ma'am.
1577603	1577783	Ma'am.
1578104	1578805	Hey, random bitch.
1578885	1579906	I need an adjective.
1580567	1581488	I need an adjective.
1581508	1582409	Can I get an adverb?
1583590	1584732	Can I get a proper noun?
1585212	1586474	Hit the call button on the flight.
1588456	1589796	How can they help you today?
1590156	1591317	Yes, I need a noun.
1591337	1595558	I need an adjective that ends in Lee.
1596398	1600259	And the good thing is you probably won't see any of those fuckers ever again.
1603040	1604700	I need a transitive verb.
1604800	1606621	Or you can just use whatever words that they give you.
1607381	1609782	You don't have to worry about whether they give you the right word or not.
1610142	1611502	Hey, hey, give me a word.
1611842	1612202	F off.
1612262	1612782	There you go.
1612842	1613262	Perfect.
1613803	1615323	Those are going to be some awesome Mad Libs.
1619249	1639651	I don't know what that has to do with games, but who cares Alright, housekeeping tonight Mad Libs is kind of a game Mad Libs are the best ever Do they have like a They should have Mad Libs on Xbox Live I was just thinking Xbox Live Arcade Mad Libs Now that 1 vs 100 is gone It should be replaced by Xbox Live Mad Libs
1640615	1642356	And the funnier you can make them, the more points you get.
1642376	1643157	Hosted by Dan.
1643497	1643857	Yeah.
1644758	1646099	I would be better than the guy who did 1 vs. 100.
1646219	1648941	That's the most fun you can have with your clothes on.
1649441	1651502	Send in your adverb right now.
1651983	1652343	Do it.
1652723	1653043	Do it.
1653143	1653684	Do it.
1653924	1657406	You remember one time back early in the show, I tried to do a Mad Lib.
1658227	1658967	Mad Libs for us.
1659007	1660088	I think I do remember.
1661429	1663070	SSJ100 Matt has a good point.
1663350	1666372	He says, I totally want to sit between Dan and Prov on a plane.
1667353	1668113	I don't blame you, Matt.
1668374	1669534	Yeah, that would be awkward.
1670996	1672619	We should do Orange Lounge Radio Mad Libs.
1675874	1677054	I know you got one somewhere.
1677094	1677314	Jamie.
1704142	1705503	You must find our Mad Libs book.
1706004	1707185	You know, I found them the other day.
1707285	1708946	So hurry up and go to Kmart and get a new one or something.
1708966	1710247	We could do chat room Mad Libs.
1710648	1711909	Let them suggest.
1712009	1712730	Right, exactly.
1713450	1715632	It's the show where every gamer gives a noun.
1715892	1719816	Everybody gets their word in Mad Libs.
1722158	1722678	Alright.
1723859	1726241	I think our chat room is really enjoying having you on the show already.
1726701	1728083	Without Dan, there would not be Mad Libs.
1728203	1728683	It's what we do.
1730333	1730994	Housekeeping.
1732196	1736423	I deleted it!
1738367	1739929	I found that shit and I owned it.
1741138	1741538	Awesome.
1742258	1742979	Thank you, folks.
1743039	1743499	Good night.
1745859	1746659	Hey, where's my OS?
1746699	1747600	Empty recycle bin.
1748000	1749000	Hell to the yes.
1751281	1757842	Everyone, go on your computer and look for MS008E underscore 247 dot EXE and delete that shit from me, please.
1758122	1760283	Her computer is going to be like, I can't do that, Jamie.
1762867	1764368	Housekeeping, Housekeeping, Housekeeping
1787725	1815268	but I'm going to be out of town next weekend so I will not be here obviously Matt is still on baby leave and Jamie, well she'll probably infect her computer or something else so she'll need to I could just do it myself just three hours of Dan Dan Radio we hate him so much there's a button that you push all you do is wait for Bobby to say push the button and then you push the button and you're live radio is so fucking easy
1816334	1817355	Especially Shoutcast.
1817395	1821097	Hell, I even ditched the Shoutcast station for a little bit.
1821117	1823258	It would be cool if I could do Pump Up the Volume again.
1823838	1824559	I won't be here.
1824739	1825279	That would win.
1825920	1828701	Maybe we'll try to pre-tape this week or something.
1828781	1829162	Maybe.
1829322	1831843	I don't want to promise that.
1831883	1832163	What?
1832403	1834104	What is one of my major pet peeves?
1834665	1836326	Using unnecessary prefixes.
1838087	1839468	I have no idea what she's talking about.
1840028	1841169	You don't pre-tape.
1841209	1842349	You just tape.
1842389	1843390	Don't you listen to George Carlin?
1845342	1845662	Shut up.
1848143	1852985	Hey, I like having Dan on the show.
1853005	1855186	The moment that he says that, I start thinking of ways to kill him.
1856947	1858488	And I start praying for death.
1859388	1860529	I think I'm done apologizing.
1860929	1862870	Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
1862890	1864830	Join our Facebook.
1867492	1869452	Hey, just so you know, it wasn't like violence.
1869492	1870753	I threw a Gatchaman at her.
1872094	1873014	I'll take a picture of it.
1875004	1879309	Do we even want to do gaming news tonight or should I just let the two of them go at it for three hours?
1879709	1882853	Welcome to our delightful marriage.
1882973	1884174	Doesn't Madden come out next week?
1884294	1884655	I don't know.
1885340	1886201	Fuck Madden!
1887022	1889203	Yes, I will agree with that totally.
1889224	1890204	Fuck Madden.
1890565	1898191	If you talked to me a couple months ago and I still had a job, I would know when Madden's coming out because it would be like my whole life.
1898551	1900633	I'd be like, oh man, I gotta get ready for Madden launch.
1900933	1902835	Oh man, how many Madden pre-orders do I have?
1903295	1908520	Now that it's not my whole life, I'm just like, hey, isn't that football game coming out?
1909653	1910534	Jesus, who cares?
1910594	1911455	Yeah, World Cup 94.
1911515	1913496	No, not football.
1913777	1914697	Football.
1915198	1915838	Football.
1919061	1922204	I thought I saw some email about Madden Midnight Madness.
1922284	1924245	Oh, look, this page I'm on.
1924305	1927548	Look, the whole time there's been this giant ad sitting there on the page I'm on.
1928069	1930411	Midnight launch at Walmart, August 10th.
1930571	1932392	So yes, Madden is out tomorrow.
1932552	1933433	I'm awesome at this.
1935149	1939953	My favorite part is that the whole time we were saying, I don't know, I don't know, it's sitting right there on the screen.
1940914	1943296	But it's been at Walmart, so it does not matter.
1943316	1945778	My screen has the Sega Genesis on it.
1946659	1947279	I can't do it.
1947719	1948020	Alright.
1948600	1949261	I regret nothing.
1954613	1956714	I wish I had more time to be an idiot.
1956734	1959335	It makes it seem like, no, I don't want to fuck Madden.
1959496	1961476	I want Madden to go off and get fucked.
1962317	1963457	Exactly.
1963878	1964278	Here's the thing.
1964318	1965818	Preferably in a big flamey death.
1965838	1966459	Here's the thing.
1966559	1972001	I would love to go out to the midnight launches and do something for the Madden launch.
1972061	1972722	Like, you know.
1973062	1974703	Make fun of people who are waiting for Madden?
1974783	1977364	No, because look, I have friends that play Madden.
1977404	1977764	You know what?
1978084	1983871	I was going to say, you've got to watch out for it because, honestly enough, I've done many, many midnight launches.
1984311	1992341	I've done Halos, I've done Grand Theft Autos, which are by far the scariest, especially San Andreas because our games are delayed like five hours.
1992821	1997126	But Madden's are the one midnight launch where dudes throw down and get into fights.
1997987	1998347	Wow.
1998507	2002669	Because you got these people in line and you know that they're the obsessives because they get in line at like noon.
2003209	2005370	It's like, dude, we got 700 copies.
2005550	2006511	We're not running out.
2007011	2008791	The guy's like, oh, I gotta get my Madden.
2009052	2009912	Gotta get that Madden.
2010132	2010932	Got that Madden.
2011372	2012813	So people are waiting for Madden.
2014514	2018335	Then they start having this argument about like, oh man, the Raiders, this team.
2018495	2019756	Oh no, this team, that team.
2019796	2021276	And they're like about to throw down.
2021297	2022217	And I'm like, guys, guys, look.
2022597	2023658	Football.
2023998	2026380	And then they like run out in the parking lot and start throwing around the football.
2026440	2027381	It worked really well.
2028301	2029642	Because I thought they were going to kill each other.
2031504	2032064	Here's the thing, though.
2032104	2040150	If I make fun of people that stand in line for Madden, then I play World of Warcraft and Dance Dance Revolution for heaven's sakes.
2040230	2045954	Like, you know, you can't like be a Trekkie and then look at the guy obsessed with Star Wars and call him a nerd.
2045994	2046555	You know what I mean?
2046835	2047435	Sure you can.
2049157	2050818	It's called having a double standard.
2054811	2056714	It happens all the time.
2056814	2057295	Thank you.
2057495	2061019	I feel like as a responsible gaming journalist.
2063342	2064083	That was funny.
2066528	2078036	I feel like as that I shouldn't, you know, I'm not saying make bad mouth one group, you know, it's just that you're supposed to make fun of people different from you, which is in your case, everybody.
2078737	2081299	So, you know, you just got to get on it.
2081539	2083380	I remember we were waiting for the Dreamcast, right?
2083440	2087803	Were you there for the whole you weren't there for that was kind of before I knew you the whole Rob time.
2087864	2088344	That's right.
2088384	2091506	That's we were waiting in line for Dreamcast.
2091566	2095249	People were driving by and they're making fun of us and we're just making fun of them back.
2095549	2096669	But it was Dreamcast, not fucking Madden.
2114223	2114984	You've got to do it.
2115044	2115764	You've got to go out.
2115784	2116485	We did the Wii thing.
2116505	2118226	Remember we did the donuts and coffee for the Wii?
2119747	2120548	I don't remember that.
2120948	2121709	Well, yeah, you didn't go.
2121729	2122369	You were asleep.
2122549	2126452	I was sleeping because I had to go to a store the next day and sell the four Wiis that I had.
2126612	2127613	Still, Beanie Babies and Pokemans.
2127633	2131195	Kristen and I were waiting in line and we bribed them for our spot in line.
2131515	2136138	Well, yeah, because you got to cut to the front because there was a listener of Orange Lounge Radio.
2136879	2140742	Like the one listener in Sacramento happened to be at the front of the line.
2141622	2142603	Whatever works.
2142623	2146828	That's a great story too because Jamie says, oh yeah, me and Kristen are going to go wait in line for the Wii.
2146868	2148309	If I can get one, can I buy one?
2148329	2149130	And I'm like, yeah, yeah.
2149370	2150271	You go on and do that.
2150331	2151973	Be sure to pick me up a copy of Zelda.
2152293	2155897	So I wake up the next day to go sell Wiis and I look on my couch.
2155917	2157438	There's a Wii sitting with a copy of Zelda.
2157498	2158740	I was like, son of a bitch.
2160181	2161202	How did she do that?
2162664	2164285	It's called contacts.
2165613	2167434	I wonder if that guy still listens.
2168175	2172057	But as soon as Krispy Kreme opened, Kris went out and got donuts.
2172417	2174358	Krispy Kreme is 24 hours, darling.
2174559	2175599	Not that one.
2175959	2176760	It wasn't 24 hours.
2177200	2179181	If he does listen, thank you.
2179281	2182744	My wife spent $250 on a game console that I've played like three times.
2184845	2186146	You've played it more than that.
2188746	2190287	Are you going to play the new Metroid when it comes out?
2190788	2191288	Probably.
2191508	2191748	All right.
2191768	2193309	Can you play the new Sonic when it comes out?
2193349	2194170	I play everything a little bit.
2194210	2195111	I won't play it on the Wii.
2195191	2195771	Sonic!
2196272	2196552	All right.
2197252	2198914	Can we actually get into some gaming news now?
2199254	2199674	Let me see.
2199694	2200855	How far into the show are we tonight?
2200875	2201336	What if I refuse?
2201356	2202316	With no gaming content.
2202757	2203797	37 minutes.
2203817	2206039	Whoever is in the chat room is OLR Recruit.
2206059	2208241	You got five minutes to change your nickname or I kick you.
2211000	2213101	I know, you're on a power trip tonight.
2213141	2213802	What is up with this?
2213982	2216864	I defeated the program, Rob.
2217304	2220266	I'm infringing on her territory, so she has to be Alpha Jamie.
2222468	2224690	My EPing is so huge right now.
2227412	2227692	Nice.
2230000	2230920	So, gaming news.
2230940	2231380	Yeah.
2231681	2232361	I got a ruler.
2232621	2234521	Once in a while, shove it up your ass.
2234602	2234902	All right.
2236542	2236662	Oh.
2236742	2237743	Now, now, now, Rob.
2237763	2239223	See, Rob, that's not appropriate.
2240303	2240904	Now, now, Rob.
2240924	2241304	Bad.
2241924	2242584	Bad, Rob.
2244505	2250627	Now, you made the OL Army recruit cry because he or she does not know how to change their name and they're very sad.
2251687	2252807	What the hell was that?
2253108	2253408	All right.
2254983	2256024	Well, I didn't want to hang out with the customer.
2256044	2256785	You are walking home.
2257785	2258066	Alright.
2258906	2260528	Can I, can I... I somehow doubt it.
2261388	2264111	Can I, hello, can I, can I do the gaming news now?
2264211	2264531	Do it!
2264711	2265392	Hi, hello?
2266112	2266533	Gaming news?
2266573	2267514	The hell is that?
2267854	2268094	Hello?
2268374	2269796	It's news about gaming.
2270898	2272560	I need a theme song for Gaming News.
2272881	2276184	Every other show on All Games has some theme song when they go into Gaming News.
2276224	2277346	We do not have a theme song.
2278307	2279148	I've got one for you, Rob.
2279188	2280129	Yakety Sax.
2281010	2281931	For this episode?
2282492	2283272	Here's Rob's theme song.
2283292	2283413	What?
2288100	2290982	Oh, I was supposed to be the one to bust out that app randomly.
2291142	2292342	Stop it right now.
2292422	2294304	What in the flippity fuck was that?
2294824	2296025	It's my Zilla app.
2297105	2298226	You are deleting that.
2298406	2301908	Loki, if you're listening, I need you to be back here.
2302969	2304189	Like, I know you have a baby.
2306010	2308252	Please come back as soon as possible.
2308512	2308972	I know you are.
2308992	2309752	It's not my fault.
2310393	2311073	I've segued into it.
2311113	2312394	Everything is your fault, Dan.
2312414	2312634	Sweet.
2312654	2312694	No.
2317922	2318182	Alright.
2318382	2319443	Then you can sit in her desk.
2320523	2324205	Dan, keep in mind, I know where you sleep.
2325606	2328747	And there's a Dave and Buster's letter opener right here with kind of sharp edges.
2329347	2329807	Kind of.
2330708	2331348	Gaming news.
2331388	2332209	So, gaming news.
2334069	2334550	Sweet.
2339935	2344178	Xbox Live Indie Games might not be getting Kinect.
2345258	2347980	All right, here's the deal.
2348040	2351402	A lot of folks might be thinking, hey, Kinect is coming out soon.
2351922	2353903	Xbox Live has this whole Indie Games thing.
2353963	2356105	Why can't we have Kinect games on Xbox Live?
2356325	2357946	Well, because they don't want to let you do it.
2358837	2361980	Look, this is because of an interview based with Digital Spy.
2362600	2372710	A Microsoft spokesperson actually said that, "...only developers with established contacts and contracts with Microsoft are going to be able to make the Kinect games.
2373410	2378255	Only those that Microsoft actually partnered with for the launch are able to make the Kinect games."
2379495	2400522	they haven't said that you will never be able to make a Kinect game if you are a developer for XNA it's going to be considered for the future but nothing is actually being considered at this time so sorry there will be no Baby Maker 2000 or whatever that game is called Kinect enabled at launch it does seem to me to be the dumbest thing they could possibly do why is that?
2401641	2408726	Well, if you think about it, all the video game companies are going to be trying to do the same thing, the same way.
2409426	2411067	They're going to try to make the Kinect work.
2411408	2422535	It's going to be some maniac out there with some indie game idea who's going to come up with the idea that makes the Kinect the must-have object that people will pay $150 for.
2422575	2425657	Because the thing is already $60 overpriced.
2427238	2428159	They're killing it.
2428419	2429460	They're just killing it.
2430876	2434137	It's killing its chances of becoming the next big thing.
2434257	2437118	Dan, I gotta admit, Dance Central is pretty awesome.
2437338	2439159	You know you wanna play Dance Central.
2439179	2440840	Dan, are you gonna dance to Poker Face?
2440920	2441340	Probably not.
2442360	2444741	I'm not saying that the Kinect is not a great idea.
2446482	2447822	I believe in the Kinect.
2447862	2450103	I believe in the demonstrations I've seen.
2450423	2452164	I think the technology's amazing.
2452544	2459727	I'm glad to see that somebody is getting on it and that it's not, you know, Sony's pathetic Wii controller rip-off.
2460441	2466044	But at the same time, I just think, from a retailer's perspective, they're charging too much for it.
2467505	2471308	And I just don't see it doing anything different yet.
2471568	2485976	I mean, if something comes out with the interactivity of the Milo program and a great game is built around it and you can stand around and play that game...
2486997	2494402	It'll sell some Kinect, sure, but you need something that, you know, like the Wii Bowling thing that got everyone to believe in the Wii.
2494782	2496963	Everything on the Wii was, oh, wow, that's kind of cool, that's kind of cool.
2497223	2498224	Wii Bowling's amazing!
2498284	2499645	It's like bowling in real life!
2500065	2502186	And the Kinect doesn't have that program.
2503667	2506509	Because you're not going to mainstream people with Dance Central.
2506749	2509331	You know, even though it's by Harmonix and it's a great game for Rob.
2511873	2534893	for me well because to you no you know that's the kind of thing that you're into that's the kind of thing that you love for me I was never really into the music rhythm games except for Guitar Hero and you know Guitar Freaks and whatnot well of course you're gonna want it too well maybe that way I have to spend the money on it maybe there will be like a Red Dead Redemption part two where you can actually choke a bitch sure exactly
2535794	2536794	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2563917	2564358	Even better.
2564618	2567420	Could you do that lasso motion one more time in studio, Dan, for us?
2567460	2568621	I'm pretty sure I'm going to pass on that.
2568661	2570803	Let's do the lasso motion one more.
2570903	2571404	Oh, darn it.
2572865	2574847	I screwed on the thing I was trying to do.
2575627	2577689	I was going to give Dan some music to do his lassoing, too.
2578150	2579891	Oh, I'm going to do some poker face.
2580231	2581172	Ma-ma-ma-ma.
2584039	2584639	Come on, Dan!
2584819	2585799	Is it on YouTube?
2586240	2587300	Swing that hand, Dan!
2587680	2588500	That's classy.
2588720	2589880	Everything is on YouTube.
2590861	2591281	You know what?
2591461	2592821	I like the piano version of that song.
2592861	2594842	I like the Cartman version.
2596242	2597862	I don't even know how I got into Just Dance.
2597882	2598762	There's a Cartman version?
2598782	2599663	Why am I not surprised?
2599803	2603964	Other comments from our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com Let's see.
2604364	2609005	SSJ100Matt says that our good buddy and indie developer YYR is pissed about this.
2609645	2613166	He was gonna make Killer Wheelchair Golden Girls game using Kinect.
2614366	2616969	Right, but they don't... I mean, they still have ultimate control over what release is.
2635439	2642364	XNA is a little different because it's all community-based.
2643085	2648369	Microsoft, per se, yes, they have ultimate control over it, but they don't really babysit it.
2648709	2650370	It's all community-driven.
2650410	2653693	What's the difference between it being controlled by your controller and controlled by Kinect?
2654093	2657436	I think it's probably a technical problem.
2658325	2660926	DarkSakura, surely you have something you want to share with us tonight
2678874	2679935	Well, it's about the move.
2680455	2681075	The move.
2682556	2684036	Ha ha ha, Sony.
2685637	2690339	Well, they are not going to have just a kiosk for showing the move.
2690359	2695382	They're actually hiring reps, Sony is, to teach people how to use the move in person.
2696302	2697743	Ooh, is it that complex?
2698163	2699263	Is it that big of a deal?
2699944	2702385	Yeah, and the reps are all training on Nintendo Wii's.
2703393	2713686	But they are going to be giving seven hours of move training to people who already have a base knowledge of Sony consoles.
2715067	2716409	And the competition.
2718512	2721575	And speaking of stupid, they're actually coming out...
2723885	2724145	What?
2726866	2728387	And speaking of stupid.
2728747	2729547	It was stupid.
2729647	2730427	So don't stop.
2730707	2737130	Okay, anyway, speaking of stupid, there's actually accessories that are going to be out with the move, like gloves.
2738270	2739991	Yes, they are gloves.
2740711	2746993	And you can secure the move thing to the glove so that you don't drop it.
2748173	2749874	What else can you secure to the glove?
2750353	2751254	Probably a cock.
2753036	2753257	Okay.
2753577	2759445	It is kind of... Well, the move is kind of wide like a good dildo, so maybe you could put a vibrator in there.
2759465	2762228	Okay.
2763550	2765152	That's my wife, ladies and gentlemen!
2766954	2767354	No.
2767775	2768435	I'm just saying.
2768495	2769555	I'm using my imagination.
2769576	2771517	You said what else could go in there that would be useful.
2771657	2774178	Joe Digitech in our chatroom is calling them love gloves.
2775119	2776039	Cucumbers, Rob.
2777580	2779581	What if you're really, really hungry?
2780041	2780582	Okay, get this.
2780622	2788166	What if you're really, really hungry and you're playing your move and you don't really want to have to let go of your cucumber to play it?
2788246	2790507	Will it be cross-compatible with Nintendo Wii?
2790667	2791768	Is it a bumpy cucumber?
2792128	2793969	I bet you can use it with a Wiimote.
2795130	2795790	Classic.
2798299	2800220	You guys can use them on your microphones.
2800460	2801861	That's true.
2801901	2810066	We can use them on our microphones so that we don't drop them because we're too... I guess maybe we don't have the fine motor control or brain power to understand.
2810426	2811087	Open hand.
2811307	2812267	Insert object.
2812407	2813088	Close hand.
2813468	2814249	Hold tightly.
2815109	2815449	Maybe?
2815749	2821173	I think if you're going to release an accessory that's so complex that you need to train people to train people.
2821413	2822153	For seven hours.
2822173	2824214	You need to pay people to train people how to use it.
2824334	2825435	For seven hours of training.
2825455	2826295	Okay, but to be fair.
2826536	2826996	To be fair.
2827036	2827456	To be fair.
2827556	2827976	Fair or down?
2828236	2828437	Fair.
2828617	2829077	Let's be fair.
2829257	2829517	We're fair.
2829737	2833920	A couple weeks ago on the show, we talked about Kinect doing demos at Macy's.
2835282	2841950	So they are also sending people out to teach them how to use Kinect, which really involves just flailing.
2842310	2844392	There isn't even a controller to use.
2844432	2850639	No gloves, no cucumbers, just you and your cucumber.
2850659	2852101	They didn't train anyone how to use iToy.
2853302	2853523	Well...
2854784	2855745	and we saw how that went.
2855965	2856486	Exactly.
2856686	2860631	All they needed to do was to get the window washing game out there in Macy's and it was sold like crazy.
2860651	2865076	That little game where you were like the ninja and you were like or the standing on the screen and you're hitting all the little ninjas.
2865236	2865917	That was pretty fun.
2866357	2870081	So now I guess it is now people decide to abuse Kinect.
2870502	2873385	They say well we have people out there teaching them how to use it right.
2874346	2876267	It's not our fault, we showed them how to do it.
2894817	2896117	Do you need help using the ATM?
2896157	2897158	I'd be like, get the fuck out of here.
2897178	2898138	I don't want you seeing my pin.
2898578	2900559	Unfortunately, I wasn't using the ATM.
2900599	2903319	I was taking my deposit to the bank, you know, when I was working at the store.
2903499	2906120	Did you know that the new ATMs will actually take your deposits?
2906220	2908801	We would make fun of the ATM ambassador every morning.
2911142	2912502	I don't think he liked me very much.
2912862	2916223	Yeah, but it was a job.
2916623	2917823	It was a job.
2917983	2923505	DarkTetsuya in our chatroom is suggesting that as far as his glove goes, you can get a glittery one for the new Michael Jackson game.
2924605	2924985	Woo!
2925626	2926626	Dot, dot, dot.
2927327	2930108	These actually look... They're padded.
2930168	2933190	Is it just so that you don't accidentally punch yourself in the face or something, too?
2934031	2936192	I'm going to put the picture of this in the chat room.
2936252	2937533	The new move helmet.
2940895	2943556	Don't forget about the crayons that come as a pack-in snack.
2946943	2947303	Look, look, look.
2975354	2986142	Back in the day, in Nintendo Power, like 6th or 7th issue, they actually profiled a real-life video game that existed in Vacaville, California, and it was called The Woos.
2986182	2986482	Yeah.
2986682	2989204	And it was The Maze, and that's what Dan's referring to.
2989224	2990545	That was in Nintendo Power, huh?
2990625	2991406	It was in Nintendo Power.
2991426	2992647	The Nintendo Power was awesome.
2994228	2994948	20 years ago, yes.
2995168	2995689	Oh, yeah.
2995749	2996529	Or whenever it started.
2996549	2999191	Back when Nintendo Power started, it was amazing.
3000152	3003114	And then GamePro came out, and we all made fun of it because it wasn't as good as Nintendo Power.
3003154	3004095	The Woos Vacaville.
3005623	3007845	I was on Team GamePro or whatever it was called.
3007885	3009026	There's a website up.
3009126	3013069	Yeah, it was like you had to write an essay and they picked 250 people to be in their little club.
3013370	3015251	And do you know what we did once we were in the club?
3016192	3016592	Nothing.
3017033	3017313	Yeah.
3017793	3018674	So it's like I won.
3018694	3022858	I don't even remember what I wrote my essay on, but yeah, it was a long time ago.
3023699	3024980	But sadly, the Wooz is long gone.
3025000	3025880	They bulldozed the Wooz.
3025900	3026501	Way gone.
3026621	3027422	What's there now?
3027722	3028643	A car dealership.
3028823	3031185	Is it a car dealership or is it like an outlet mall?
3032734	3034256	I'm pretty sure that's where they built the outlets.
3048752	3049773	Okay, this is kind of funny.
3049813	3053277	I found a blog about it with an aerial view.
3053657	3057241	It probably was the same aerial view that was in Nintendo Power years ago because they would actually show it.
3057261	3059083	They would actually change the configuration every few months.
3059103	3059724	I love how this starts.
3060084	3061666	Back in the late 80s, things sucked.
3062086	3062767	The music sucked.
3062967	3063628	The movies sucked.
3063928	3065209	The entertainment slash things to do sucked.
3065230	3066411	What the fuck are they smoking?
3066471	3068613	Back in the late 80s, the movies rocked.
3068633	3069995	We had hella arcades then.
3070515	3072596	What the hell, author?
3072656	3075398	This person apparently is pooping on the woos.
3075438	3077320	Was born in 1991, so kiss my ass.
3077400	3078881	That person sucks.
3078941	3079981	Alright, what's next?
3083464	3085125	The Princess Bride did not suck.
3085165	3085605	Thank you!
3085905	3087806	Mystique came in and said, hey, hey.
3087906	3089527	The Princess Bride does not suck.
3089628	3090868	I don't even know what you're talking about.
3090888	3092009	Because the Princess Bride was like 87, 88.
3093669	3093909	Right.
3094570	3100739	And this guy says that there were no good movies in the late 80s and therefore Mystique has just made a logic.
3101480	3102782	She's done a logic thing.
3103263	3104505	Wow, anything can happen once.
3104525	3107068	It's inconceivable.
3108390	3110153	I do not think that word means what you think it means.
3112560	3113141	My head hurts.
3114342	3116444	Let's talk about NBA Elite 11.
3117085	3118506	It comes with NBA Jam.
3118887	3119447	Thank you, Dan.
3119487	3120428	That's what I was going to report.
3120448	3121509	That's a scam.
3122070	3128617	It's a scam because I have no interest in NBA Elite 11, but I want NBA Jam with a burning, fiery passion.
3129198	3131320	And I don't want to pay 60 bucks for it.
3132441	3132901	Burning, huh?
3133702	3133942	What?
3134522	3138323	So just pretend you didn't hear that and I'm going to report this news you've never heard before.
3139263	3146165	NBA Elite 11 will have a one-time download code that will let you access three modes of NBA Jam.
3146185	3148386	Play Now, Classic Campaign, and Online.
3148706	3151367	This would explain why we saw ESRB ratings last week.
3152367	3155228	They are not selling these separately, at least for now.
3155608	3156628	My gut tells me...
3157228	3158509	Where there's money to be made.
3159070	3162893	This is how it's going to work for like two months or three months, and then it'll be out for everybody.
3162913	3165615	Well, sure, it's EA, and EA is all about the money.
3165875	3180288	But, oh man, for people like me, who are idiots, who have been dying for NBA Jam, either I gotta pay 50 bucks to get it on the Wii, or I gotta pay 60 bucks to get it on the 360, rather than paying the 15 bucks, which I would be totally willing to pay to get it on the 360.
3180328	3180488	Because...
3183131	3187628	I love NBA Jam I don't like sports games, but I love NBA Jam
3188829	3212900	Shaka, Laka I am in your court I made a basketball joke That was awesome I hate you so much I don't like a lot of sports games either but I love NBA Jam, Double Dribble Blades of Steel Blades of Steel is sweet It's like the best game Konami ever made I like the fact that you can play Gradius at halftime I know, right?
3213060	3214401	Awesome
3216442	3220564	Sports games aren't always missable for me.
3220584	3221805	There's some that you have to have.
3222125	3223145	I'm kind of in the same court as you.
3223165	3224266	They have to put the fun in.
3224426	3227448	If they're fun, you will play them.
3227987	3229989	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3252825	3254145	and Bill Clinton.
3254165	3257226	That was the first revision of NBA Jam Tournament Edition.
3257526	3258066	Hold on though.
3258086	3259527	We can do that on MAME.
3259727	3269309	The way of looking at it that you just said, Dan, is that I can pay $50 to have it on the Wii or I could just wait and pay $15 for it on the Xbox 360 but that's assuming it would be $15.
3270710	3273450	What if EA knows they have a premium game here?
3273950	3279532	What if you were looking at it as I'm paying $60 for NBA Jam and getting some other basketball game for free?
3279632	3280352	That's pretty graphics.
3280532	3284594	Right, if it was a full release, because the thing is I'll never play NBA Elite 11.
3285014	3285694	I just never will.
3285714	3286294	Not even once?
3286574	3287175	Probably not.
3287275	3287535	Okay.
3287935	3298419	Because I've played NBA Live, I've played NBA 2K, you know, and honestly, in this race, my horse is definitely 2K.
3298879	3300320	It's just better.
3300440	3301960	I mean, I understand everyone out there.
3302521	3304421	Oh, NBA, EA Sports, whatever.
3304561	3307763	NBA Live has just been atrocious since like 2005.
3309704	3311985	But NBA Jam... Hence why it's now NBA Elite.
3312605	3313026	Exactly.
3313046	3315947	They finally said, okay, we're tired of getting our asses kicked by 2K.
3316267	3317167	We're going to change the name.
3317188	3318008	We're going to change the game.
3318028	3320669	And then 2K's like, Jordan, motherfuckers!
3321109	3323450	And then Elite was like, screw!
3323811	3324651	This sucks!
3325792	3327152	We'll put NBA Jam with it!
3327212	3329013	And I'm just like, oh, touche.
3329353	3330374	Touche EA.
3330534	3331434	Very well played.
3331954	3332735	A2 EA?
3333155	3333835	Yeah, whatever.
3334616	3336477	Yeah, I want NBA Jam bad.
3338004	3339765	TigerClaw in our chatroom says, think about it.
3339845	3344467	If NBA Jam had online, we can try to represent the OL Army in the Big Battle sometime in the future.
3345368	3348389	Completely forgot to mention Big Battle during housekeeping because I got derailed.
3348409	3349370	Something about Mad Libs.
3349450	3350690	Mad Libs!
3350730	3355353	Something that the listeners have been asking for for forever is coming to the Big Battle.
3356033	3356714	A music game.
3356814	3357154	That's right.
3357174	3358915	Guitar Hero 5 is now in the Big Battle.
3358955	3359355	Check it out.
3359715	3360896	TheBigBattle.net.
3361676	3362016	There you go.
3362276	3368720	And if OLR doesn't win the music game competition, I don't, like, really?
3368820	3369120	Really?
3369621	3370761	I will disown all of you.
3370781	3371202	No, I'm kidding.
3371542	3378466	I think my solution is if somebody is buying NBA Elite and doesn't care about NBA Jam, I will buy their download code from them.
3379827	3381088	You're not going to find that person.
3382348	3383369	You're killing me with this, Rob.
3383820	3386562	Well, I'm not going to buy it all special and shit.
3387602	3389343	See, I'm looking at it this way.
3390063	3406693	What if instead of looking at it as I'm buying this game and getting ripped off with this game I don't even want, what if NBA Jam on the Wii cost me $50, I could pay $10 more to get it on the 360, which is pretty much what most premium usually is.
3406993	3408634	You have to look at it the other way around.
3410330	3418655	I mean, sure, I want it to come out for $15 too, but, you know, think about how the Wii folks would be in an uproar if it was like, well, it's $15 there, but you're going to charge me $50?
3418755	3419896	F you.
3420956	3422257	The Wii version gets extra boats.
3423427	3423607	NBA Jam
3446624	3463934	DJ Maxx portable 3 has some new features it's and keep in mind this is not a game that I have really played much if any of but they have a three-track remixing system that's made just for that particular version
3466556	3482997	And, uh, I was watching the video of it while you were going off on, um, NBA whatever And, um, but they're saying that, um, that it's supposed to actually be a completely revamped system It looks kinda neat
3483444	3485625	Did they put a mode in the game that will make it fun?
3486705	3511612	I'm kidding, I'm kidding, DJ Max is fine DJ Max is, it's Beatmania 2DX with buttons on your PSP And it's fine, I'm just giving it a hard time I just wanted like, some of the DJ Max fans to sit there and The music is actually sounding kind of cool The music's neat This is great radio, we're just sitting here I don't know what that is, but that gave me a headache Ah, creepy girl with no eyes Alright
3512941	3513321	I don't know.
3513761	3518202	I'm glad they're putting in some new modes and some new ideas so it doesn't just feel like a 2DX port.
3518282	3519262	It's kind of cool.
3519282	3521503	And to be fair, they have had some other stuff.
3521523	3526424	They do a three-button mode, a six-button mode, a eleventy-billion-button mode.
3526704	3529645	They do all these different modes and tricks with it.
3529685	3532525	Somebody else's PSP mode, somebody's Wii mode.
3533565	3535586	I would like to see 2DX on the PSP.
3536226	3537786	I would like to see 2DX on the PS3.
3538246	3540927	With the Konami-style 2DX PSP controller.
3541427	3545350	Where is my PlayStation 3 version of 2DX?
3545451	3546411	Why has that not come out yet?
3546431	3548293	I thought 2DX was over.
3549194	3550735	No, it's still going in the arcades in Japan.
3550755	3553137	Oh, I thought that they actually did a final version.
3553317	3554978	They did a final Beatmania.
3555719	3560803	They did Beatmania 1 final, they did Beatmania 3 final, but they never did a Beatmania 2 deluxe final.
3561724	3562144	Interesting.
3562184	3562945	That's still going.
3562965	3565326	They're on like... 98th style.
3565346	3566207	I don't know.
3566247	3568069	They're on like 18th or 19th style.
3568229	3568589	They're a lot.
3570010	3572131	Because it proved popular and has longevity.
3573412	3573932	It's a neat game.
3573952	3575693	It's because that arcade machine is amazing.
3575713	3579035	The next one's going to be with remix mode or some shit in it.
3579195	3579856	It's so good.
3580916	3585019	Well, if you like these DJ games, maybe DJ Hero 2 is something you're interested in.
3585119	3585999	I know I am, actually.
3586039	3587860	The first DJ Hero game was really underrated.
3587920	3589081	Why are you laughing at me?
3589461	3592183	Oh, you told me I was going to jump in and say, but probably not.
3593601	3596462	No, DJ Hero 2 is going to have, of course, the multiplayer mode.
3596482	3601384	And DJ Hero 1 had that too, but one thing that was missing when you would play online is rewind.
3601764	3602204	That's right.
3602344	3604805	Now you can rewind in multiplayer mode.
3605085	3607706	You couldn't do that before, but now you're actually going to get to rewind.
3608006	3614028	So once you get enough power in the multiplayer mode, you're going to be able to spin the thing backwards, and you rewind the track and get more points.
3614568	3616469	So in DJ Hero 2, this will be in there.
3616869	3621871	And what happens is that while you rewind, your opponent gets to do nothing while you rack up the points.
3622111	3622711	Hee hee!
3623271	3624051	So that'll be kind of fun.
3624471	3625752	Yeah, that's gonna get pretty ugly.
3628093	3631274	I'm just looking forward to the rapping in it and how that'll play out online.
3631394	3635595	Actually, Dan, I would love to do some DJ Hero where I will do the DJ and you do the rapping.
3635875	3636576	Wouldn't that be fun?
3638797	3639437	You know what we need?
3639457	3640357	I would throw down.
3640397	3642558	We need Dan playing a Def Jam rap star.
3642998	3643799	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3662340	3685191	They had Def Jam Rapstar sitting next to Glee Karaoke Revolution And I will tell you what Def Jam Rapstar popped a cap in Glee's ass so fast It's not even funny because the Glee game was terrible Of course it did Well, first of all, anything that Konami I mean, I hate to say this because I have great love for Konami But anything that Konami does these days is pretty bad
3686041	3687402	Dance Masters looks interesting.
3687542	3691124	It's the first really, really interesting music game I've seen from them in a while.
3691164	3693025	Who knows, but the budget's gone.
3693085	3696307	Konami is not into gaming like they were.
3696427	3702591	There's just not a lot of... Well, they closed one of their offices that was a huge part of it.
3702611	3703511	They closed a lot of it.
3703571	3705632	I mean, a lot of Konami is just history.
3706053	3707513	All the good talent is gone.
3708914	3712937	They're basically outsourcing their franchises to make some money, but...
3713857	3718819	Yeah, anything that Konami does is, you know, pretty cut right these days.
3719200	3721921	Not to get off topic, but what do you think of that Castlevania game that's coming out?
3721961	3723962	The Castlevania God of War thing.
3724890	3727311	It's hopefully going to be okay.
3727431	3732213	I mean, Castlevania in 3D is pretty miss and miss.
3732333	3737455	Not that Lament of Innocence and Curse of Darkness was the other one.
3737475	3737975	I think so, yeah.
3738095	3744017	Those weren't the worst 3D action games to ever happen, but they weren't the quality of what you'd consider Castlevania.
3744537	3746998	The new one looks really good.
3747538	3757021	They say they got Kojima on it, and you know, Kojima's kind of Konami's only superstar that's really left So, if it's awesome, great!
3757841	3770545	I just don't know, I just don't have a lot of, you know, hope for 3D Castlevania If I play it and I like it, I'm gonna be pleasantly surprised If you like God of War, I think you'll like it, it's very pretty It's much sexier
3770865	3771726	I love Symphony of the Night
3791109	3799894	Well, they're all building off of that formula and, you know, they're all, all the 2D ones are, you know, they're all portables and, you know, they lose points for that.
3800875	3802576	Um, not that they're bad, but yeah.
3802596	3804597	I really liked Portrait of Ruin when I got through it.
3804917	3805998	Portrait of Ruin was a great game.
3807399	3807839	Uh, let's see.
3807879	3812682	Salacious Pop in our chat room says, Konami only seems to burp up new flavors of Castlevania and Silent Hill.
3812722	3814523	What was their last really new IP?
3815463	3816504	Uh, Saw?
3816924	3818405	Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
3821764	3822024	Okay.
3822304	3823285	I'm actually trying to think.
3824645	3826826	SSJ100, Matt is still waiting on a new Zone of Enders game.
3827066	3832167	Everybody who came into the store and saw there was a Saw game, everybody was like, there's a Saw game?
3833268	3833968	Is it any good?
3833988	3835188	I don't know.
3835248	3836129	No one's ever played it.
3837409	3842091	I've heard from people that can stomach those kind of games that it's actually not as bad as you'd think.
3842171	3842571	And you know what?
3842671	3842891	I did...
3843869	3851660	I watched Shane play the second game's demo at E3 and it was interesting except for all the gore.
3852461	3853583	I just don't like that stuff.
3854144	3855546	But yet I love Silent Hill.
3855646	3856387	I can't explain it.
3857188	3860509	Silent Hill isn't, well, it's a different kind of gory.
3860529	3861530	It's more of a decay.
3862370	3865231	And I feel like Saw is more like LOL gore.
3865552	3866652	Like it's just like random.
3866672	3867292	Saw gore.
3867352	3868673	Here's how I put it.
3869033	3870033	Look at the violence.
3870153	3871014	Exactly.
3871034	3871614	Blood.
3871914	3874835	Where Saw is fresh squirting, pulsating blood.
3874955	3875236	Yes.
3875596	3878637	Silent Hill is, it's been dead for a while, but it's still twitching.
3878937	3884506	Or the gore serves as much as I hate to say this, a plot point, as weird as that is.
3884586	3887251	It's for scene, not for shock.
3887391	3888974	Check out his head, it's a pyramid.
3889234	3889454	Yes.
3890919	3893880	Dude, this guy's wearing a big metal triangle on his head.
3894100	3895300	Triangle man.
3895380	3896261	Triangle man.
3898021	3901382	How about another piece of gaming news, DarkSakura?
3901622	3902102	News?
3902362	3902882	That's fantastic.
3902902	3905643	This made me laugh my ass off, Rob.
3906484	3912005	Nipponichi, the company that made Disgaea, is doing a game called Criminal Girls for PSP.
3912785	3917787	And it's like bad 70s chicks in prison is what it is.
3919089	3920512	This sounds awesome.
3921534	3923298	Was it directed by Quentin Tarantino?
3923919	3925202	Was Lindsay Lohan in it?
3926118	3927059	All Man Machete is going to be great.
3927079	3928020	No, but Lady Gaga is.
3929581	3929921	Sorry.
3930141	3930542	Good enough.
3931062	3933384	Oh, is it going to be like the telephone music video for real?
3933404	3934045	Because that's awesome.
3934225	3935085	It's not a game about rehab.
3935105	3936306	Can I read the damn story?
3936647	3936867	No.
3937047	3937607	Not tonight.
3939049	3944253	Anyway, you play as an all-female prison warden that's set in hell.
3945394	3947796	And you have to rehabilitate seven prisoners.
3948536	3950978	And each of the prisoners are like seven deadly sins.
3951038	3953981	You have gluttony, greed, lust, you know.
3956863	3959364	Misty comes in and asks, is it the home for infinite losers?
3959904	3961084	You don't have a microphone.
3962065	3962725	That's why she keeps doing it.
3962745	3964986	If you're going to say something, come in and grab the microphone.
3965026	3967106	Just take Misty's when she's not looking.
3967386	3969587	So you know how you have to rehabilitate them, Rob?
3970087	3970307	How?
3970987	3972728	With spankings and massages.
3972788	3974088	I read about this.
3974128	3974949	Because here's the deal.
3975369	3979330	Nippon Ichi had to cancel like three projects.
3981533	3983114	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4006704	4008765	Does it work with the Kinect?
4010866	4014947	It's on the PSP Does it work with the Kinect anyway?
4015908	4018769	Probably I'm sure someone will find a way
4020023	4023925	I am... So wait, let me get this straight again.
4024145	4031328	You are in a prison in the 70s, in hell, and you spank people to discipline them.
4032329	4033549	Or massage them, right?
4033949	4034610	Is that what I heard?
4035490	4044374	I think, ladies and gentlemen... Video game of the year, 2010.
4046963	4047783	No, there's pictures.
4047823	4048704	Let me find the picture.
4049284	4052405	It was... Oh, my gosh.
4052885	4053365	Was there a secret?
4053405	4055126	Was the secret word spank?
4055626	4058127	Did Pee Wee Herman come out before the show?
4059848	4062348	It was in Den Geeky PlayStation Magazine.
4064189	4066750	You know, maybe I missed the break during Bobby's show tonight.
4067370	4070171	Did he come out and say, today's secret word is spank.
4070331	4072672	Oh, so that's why I missed it.
4072732	4075213	If somebody says spank, scream real loud.
4077519	4078120	Are you okay, DarkSakura?
4078140	4085728	I already put the link to the picture in there of what the characters look like with their ginormous boobies.
4086048	4090313	And again, to listen live, we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.
4090853	4093436	And I know this makes for terrible radio, but I'm looking at this.
4093777	4095619	Of course, they have gigantic tits.
4097731	4120791	and they're like doing that whole blushing thing it looks like see how like okay notice this like the top of their tits is red that's either like a really bad sunburn tan it's boob blush or they're getting spanked on their tits probably or even better it's boob blush I can tell you women actually blush their boobies I didn't know that have you ever blushed your boobs not on purpose
4124008	4126730	This tells you how bad off the Japanese gaming market is.
4126910	4129611	Or did Dan just have red stuff on his face and he just went...
4136635	4139576	This is a story about how bad the Japanese gaming market is.
4141177	4143718	They're killing their important projects and they're keeping this.
4144598	4145559	They know who their market is.
4145999	4150521	Well, right, because that's the people in Japan who are buying the games or the psycho pervert otakus.
4150981	4153662	I'm sorry, but this game sounds awesome.
4154103	4155383	And why are you knocking it?
4155463	4157564	Because we should be getting this game as well.
4157684	4158605	We won't, but we should.
4158905	4161826	This is President Cat 2010 right here.
4161946	4162667	I want this game.
4162687	4163407	I still want President Cat.
4164415	4165116	Dammit, me too.
4166537	4168139	Why have you not done this for me, husband?
4168960	4170602	I have no idea what you're talking about.
4171383	4172044	President Cat.
4172124	4173625	Your husband doesn't actually listen to this show.
4173665	4176148	He just likes to come on once in a while and bring the lulls.
4177129	4181674	I know about the existence of President Cat, but I don't really know what she's talking about.
4183856	4184277	That's all right.
4185188	4188489	Hey, let's get into what video games are coming out soon.
4188529	4191351	And around the world, we're going to travel the world and look at release dates.
4191371	4192851	And we'll start in America.
4193712	4194552	America.
4194912	4200154	Coming out this... You said America, Rob, so I was just representing.
4200174	4201175	I hope the mic didn't pick that up.
4201615	4203436	You know the mic turns off, you know.
4203816	4204256	Mine doesn't.
4204676	4205617	I was just representing.
4206817	4207277	Oh, thank you.
4207357	4208918	Alpha Cat Anagram in chat brings up a good point.
4208938	4213420	The PSP is region-free, so it's less of a pain than region-locked President Cat.
4214036	4214676	Good job.
4215256	4215496	Love it.
4215856	4219157	Alright, coming out this week in America, Madden NFL 11, of course.
4219177	4220197	We already talked about that before.
4220237	4223098	It's coming out on the 10th and there's midnight launches going on everywhere.
4223538	4227799	And do any games dare to compete against Madden 11?
4228179	4229360	I don't think so.
4229460	4230800	There's not a lot else coming out.
4230820	4231560	Let me see what counter.
4231840	4236741	There's also tons and tons and tons of peripherals and things coming out.
4236922	4240342	But as far as games coming out against Madden 11, nope.
4240842	4241703	This is Madden's week.
4242263	4242963	That's it for the U.S.
4243483	4247786	Meanwhile in England, they're like, Madden, that's a game for wankers!
4250707	4255109	We have coming out on the 10th, Dragon Age Golems of Amgarak.
4257050	4258731	On 11th, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World.
4258831	4262413	On the 12th, yeah, Madden, NFL 11, like anyone's going to give a crap about it over there.
4263414	4267316	13th is Hoop World and Ship Simulator Extremes.
4269157	4269437	That's it.
4270666	4290757	I gotta say, just tangent a little bit I didn't know much about that whole Scott Pilgrim vs. the World thing I didn't realize that it's based on a comic book where clearly the author has a huge boner for video games because there's so many video game references in it Uh-oh, Mystique's coming in And he's Canadian Well then, fuck him!
4290857	4294058	He's from Canadia I love Canadia
4297421	4298442	Is that near Elbonia?
4299003	4301525	Look, look, I have Canadian friends, okay?
4302206	4302606	Okay?
4302686	4303127	I'm sorry.
4303307	4303587	All right.
4303807	4305049	I like the Canadianites.
4306170	4306910	No, for real, though.
4306930	4307551	Uh-oh.
4307671	4308272	Mystique's coming.
4308332	4310774	We're here.
4310854	4311875	We're here.
4312075	4314217	Flop, flop, flop, because she's wearing, I think, flip-flops or something.
4314438	4315559	Smack, smack, smack, smack, smack, smack.
4318790	4319331	But here's the thing.
4320371	4327316	At first, I had no interest in seeing the movie because I was like, oh, it's Michael Cera and it's not Arrested Development, so why would I care, right?
4328177	4332840	But then I hear it's all about this video game homage.
4332920	4337523	And then the whole thing where they actually went to Miyamoto to get the rights to use the Zelda music.
4338163	4344387	And you know the whole comic book is about he goes to defeat the ex-boyfriends who are like the seven bosses.
4345408	4346029	Dan, take me on a date!
4346069	4346169	Yes!
4371964	4386963	I'm not dating all of you Misty would I'll take Misty out on a date because Alan's in San Francisco so Misty can be my date but no Nookie Rob's got jungle fever Rob's got jungle fever
4389004	4391646	If we call Alan, can we watch?
4392307	4393628	Stop it.
4393748	4394209	Stop it.
4394930	4396791	Y'all are filthy, disgusting pervs.
4396891	4397232	Hey!
4397572	4398213	You hang out with us.
4398433	4400275	Xbox 360 in Japan.
4400315	4401536	How about Japanese releases?
4401796	4402297	I guess.
4402477	4403778	Here's a sport they love in Japan.
4403878	4404399	Baseball.
4404479	4407842	Major League Baseball 2K10 is out from 2K Sports this week in Japan.
4408082	4409484	And it can't even sell there.
4410224	4410825	Stop.
4410885	4412166	I think it does all right over there.
4412426	4412807	I don't know.
4412867	4414168	They're big, big.
4414468	4416610	They got the big boner for baseball in Japan.
4417531	4418472	Even bigger than here.
4418872	4419172	MLB 2K.
4419212	4419653	Sucks.
4419973	4422616	Sports of Japan.
4423096	4424417	Sumo and baseball.
4424677	4426779	That might actually be their big release this week.
4426819	4427540	But I have to say this.
4427600	4429121	On the Nintendo Wii, it's not this week.
4429161	4430583	It's coming out August 26th.
4430683	4431784	But I'm sorry.
4431824	4433445	This is the greatest name for a video game ever.
4433465	4434246	Are you ready for this?
4434446	4434867	On the Wii.
4434887	4436248	This is Super Spankin' Massage.
4437369	4438210	August 26, Twinkle Queen
4456636	4457236	That's on the 26th.
4457436	4458077	That's not this week.
4458097	4460137	But I just want to take a moment to acknowledge Twinkle Queen.
4461638	4463759	It looks like the baseball game is the only big release in Japan this week.
4463819	4464399	Oh, no, I lied.
4464419	4465139	On the PSP.
4465719	4466259	Oh, awesome.
4466499	4468560	Corpse Party is the name of the game.
4469080	4474482	Corpse Party Blood Covered Repeated Fear is coming out in a regular and limited edition.
4474502	4479124	It looks like some type of survival-ish horror game with a very 8-bit style to it.
4479464	4480164	And there's a chick.
4480484	4482825	They're wearing Sakura uniforms.
4482845	4484306	They're just wearing schoolgirl uniforms.
4484326	4484466	Yeah.
4485726	4487327	But I guess they're having a corpse party?
4487447	4492788	I don't know Also coming out of the PSP Remember last week that Scary Stories game came out?
4492948	4496449	Oh, that's right But that was just like public domain stories on the DS, right?
4496529	4510432	Yeah Kazoku Keikai-ku comes out on PSP this week And it looks like the less scary alternative if you want to play Because these girls are eating And this girl looks like she's farting on another one I don't know what's happening there, but whatever
4511193	4511753	Scott Pilgrim vs. The World
4531270	4540197	The series is about 23-year-old Canadian Scott Pilgrim, a slacker, hero, and part-time bassist who is living in Toronto and plays bass guitar in the band Sex Bob-Omb.
4540758	4547283	He falls in love with American delivery girl Ramona V. Flowers, but must defeat her seven evil ex-boyfriends in order to date her.
4547923	4548964	And that's the plot of the movie.
4549044	4549745	That's cute.
4550045	4550666	It does sound cute.
4550686	4553728	By the way... Dan, will you defeat my seven exes to date me?
4554492	4556293	That probably wouldn't be very hard.
4556594	4561898	One of the rival bands in the game, or in the comics, is called Clash at Demon Head.
4562338	4562578	Nice.
4562598	4563319	That's great.
4563539	4566521	See, that's how you knew that guy had a boner for video games.
4566601	4567141	Oh, no doubt.
4567301	4570444	People don't know that game unless they're... Well, Sex Bob-omb is, you know... Sex Bob-omb's awesome, too.
4570464	4573826	Sex Bob-omb's a pretty good one, but yeah, Clash at Demon Head, that's pretty obscure.
4575047	4575527	It's awesome.
4576008	4576348	Squeak.
4576588	4579651	The game is actually really, really cool, by the way.
4579911	4581272	Why are you having a squeak, DarkSakura?
4581372	4585616	Because I watched the trailer for this and I totally, totally, totally, totally, totally want this game.
4585756	4586757	Well, what is it?
4586897	4587698	Sonic Colors.
4589099	4589479	Oh, wow.
4590500	4590740	What?
4592062	4592322	What?
4592582	4593583	The theme song is awesome.
4593834	4596115	The theme song is cheeseball-tastic and I love it.
4596195	4596775	But not good.
4596895	4599556	But not in the way that everyone's supersonic racing.
4601597	4603018	But it's Sonic Colors.
4603038	4603698	It's coming out.
4603898	4604378	Oh, damn it.
4604618	4605759	I was trying to play it here in studio.
4605779	4606799	There's a stupid ad on this.
4606839	4607059	Hold on.
4607079	4608120	We'll get to the ad in a moment.
4608580	4609440	It's not a good ad.
4609520	4610561	It's a stupid ad.
4610641	4612801	In Europe, the game is coming out November 12th.
4613682	4617343	And it's actually the Sonic Team head.
4617363	4621665	Iizuka Takashi is the big dude.
4622966	4630671	Who is handling the game, and it's pretty, and it's really pretty.
4630691	4633914	Look at this and tell me this isn't gorgeous.
4634014	4634394	It looks cute.
4634414	4635675	Take off at the speed of sound.
4645796	4646676	That's it, buffering.
4647977	4649018	It did the same thing for me.
4649038	4649578	Alright, whatever.
4649658	4650078	There you go.
4650679	4650999	Good enough.
4651599	4654480	Loading really, really slow.
4656221	4659383	At any rate, it looks intensely, intensely fun.
4661664	4664846	It reminded me just of how excited I was about Sonic Adventure.
4666307	4667227	And there's no shadow.
4667807	4669248	There's no all these other characters.
4669388	4670949	It's just freaking Sonic and Tails.
4671229	4672610	It looks cute as hell, I'll give you that.
4674052	4688301	SSJ100 Matt is in our chatroom saying Rob's band, speaking of like Scott Pilgrim's band and the rival bands Rob's band is Boom Boom Kitty Fuck I don't know where that comes from That was from Jay Can I call you Boom Boom Kitty Fuck?
4688401	4699328	No, wasn't it The nickname that he gave his Boo Boo Kitty Fuck Not Boom Boom There's a difference between Boom Boom and Boo Boo It's crossed over with Boom Boom Dollar Alright
4700034	4703136	The Mashup of the Century Boom Boom Kitty Fuck Orange Lounge
4723430	4723950	True story, people!
4747492	4766160	by the way if you want old episodes of OLR they're out there and I'm just gonna I'm gonna warn you though old OLR is nothing like new OLR he means out there like it is just wow wow have we come a long way in eight years like we haven't come far but it's still a long way we've come a way
4767160	4769302	We have evolved, but the spirit lives on.
4769462	4777187	If you listen to episode one, it really is a lot like tonight's show, actually, where it just isn't really about anything.
4777728	4778208	No, I'm kidding.
4778248	4778568	I'm kidding.
4778688	4779769	It was a lot shorter, though.
4780410	4780630	It was.
4780670	4781931	We used to only have a two-hour show.
4781951	4783092	Now we're like four hours.
4783112	4783512	I don't know.
4784573	4784833	Anyhow.
4785731	4786171	Rob, more!
4806944	4820921	it's actually available for download so you can hack the ROM there and what's weird about this though they're not trying to do it to actually say like oh hey we're excited for Sonic 4 no no they're adding the features to try and point out how awful they are
4823334	4823934	I don't know though.
4823975	4827497	I think there'd be a lot of people that would get this to kind of like see the cool new features.
4827597	4827877	I don't know.
4827917	4829218	Sonic 4 didn't look terrible to me.
4829779	4830179	But whatever.
4830199	4831300	This is why I need Sonic Colors.
4831540	4833221	It's a very interesting form of protest.
4833261	4834762	Did you miss that a couple shows ago?
4835062	4835683	Matt brought that up.
4835983	4838525	It's the Sonic hat that you get for pre-ordering it.
4839045	4839906	And it actually looks like a hat.
4839926	4840346	Pre-order!
4842288	4842568	Alright.
4842628	4843188	Don't look at me.
4845550	4855637	All right, well, speaking of classic games such as Sonic 2 and, well, really any Sonic in general, we like to take a trip through the gaming vault and find a classic game of the week.
4855677	4863523	The Dark Sakura says, hey, listen, you damn kids, you ought to be playing this game and showing a little respect.
4865646	4867367	It's called the classic video game of the week.
4867427	4870708	DarkSakura, what is tonight's classic video game of the week?
4870989	4874570	Shadow Dancer, specifically the Mega Drive slash Genesis version.
4874910	4877572	Imagine that, a Genesis game inspired by your Genesis.
4881253	4886016	Although, now this is one of the games that I had Dan playing for me last night.
4890516	4891276	It's just Shinobi.
4906261	4909562	The Mega Drive version of Shadow Dancer, The Secret of Shinobi.
4909982	4912102	It came out on December 1st, 1990 in Japan.
4912782	4915103	And the releases came out in North America and Europe afterwards.
4915283	4916703	And it's on the Virtual Console.
4918384	4921324	And also in the Sega Genesis Collection for PS2 and PSP.
4921424	4923345	Dude, that dog just ate that guy's face.
4923445	4924105	I know, right?
4924305	4925165	This one has a dog.
4926005	4926225	What?
4926545	4927965	You have a ninja dog.
4928986	4930286	How freaking cool is that?
4931420	4937803	Anyway, the main guy did not have a name in the arcade version.
4938564	4940765	In this one, though, he's called Hayate.
4941725	4948689	And his dog is... And he's actually supposed to be the son of Joe Musashi from the original Shinobi.
4950370	4952150	However, that was in the Japanese version.
4952291	4952791	In the U.S.
4952871	4955672	version, he's just Joe Musashi.
4956373	4957373	The dog's name is Yamato.
4958774	4960955	Did you know that that was the traditional name of Japan?
4962805	4963225	I did not.
4963506	4963986	Now you know.
4964586	4966147	That's why the ship was called Yamato.
4967308	4978756	Anyway, they're trying to avenge the death of a guy named Kato who was Hayate's mentor.
4979736	4982118	Or Musashi's student, depending on which version you're playing.
4983233	4984954	So yeah, different stages, different stuff.
4986135	4991559	Instead of looking for time bombs like you did in the coin-op blend, you rescue hostages.
4992640	5000505	And your bonus ones, instead of being the first person ones, are where you fall off of the building and shoot ninjas in the face with shuriken.
5001877	5002558	DarkSakura.com
5024418	5028380	and it's pretty, pretty hardcore.
5028480	5031221	And yeah, I didn't do the first Shinobi because honestly I like this one better.
5032462	5034163	Because you have a ninja dog!
5035743	5036183	Tell me!
5037104	5038705	Dance in the other room and go, ninja dog!
5039545	5041446	That should just be a video game right there, ninja dog.
5041746	5042006	Yes.
5042126	5044107	Alright.
5044647	5046208	I want a ninja dog.
5046808	5049169	And then I want my cat to be the big fat geisha.
5051530	5052651	He's an interesting ninja.
5053621	5054282	Is that it then?
5054322	5054742	That's it?
5055102	5055322	Yes.
5055562	5058865	Alright, classic game of the week is Shadow Dancer.
5059826	5062568	I want to say you did like one of the other Shinobi games before.
5062608	5063428	I don't think it was this one.
5063468	5065089	I think I actually did Shinobi before.
5065330	5066010	You probably did.
5066250	5071114	I want to say I've seen that in the... But Shadow Dancer is freaking amazing because you have an injured dog!
5072060	5072841	and Tacos.
5107230	5109652	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.
5109712	5115317	We are live on Sunday, August 8th, 2010 for the 377th episode of our show.
5115637	5119541	We're taping live at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.
5119941	5124385	No Loki tonight, he's still out on baby leave, but Dan the Man is joining us in studio tonight.
5124645	5125065	Sweet!
5125345	5130248	As is Misty, joining us all the way from the east-ish coast.
5130388	5134910	It's all the east coast to me, even though she's really from the Midwest, but we had that talk a little earlier.
5134970	5137231	But she flew out here to be with us, so we really appreciate it.
5137251	5137611	And we have tacos.
5138091	5142754	Yes, and we are all eating Mystique's tacos right now, and they're delicious, I must say.
5143074	5143474	It's great.
5144114	5145875	So, needs more salt, though.
5145995	5146876	No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
5146916	5147136	Alright.
5147836	5149437	Because they're low sodium, get it?
5149617	5150878	All right, anyway.
5150978	5152019	No, actually, they were really good.
5152959	5156782	I would never have guessed that they were any type of special diet tacos.
5157603	5161625	Anyhow, I'm kind of tired today, you guys, and I apologize.
5161965	5162726	I'm really tired.
5162806	5171972	But last night, I actually did something I've been wanting to do for like 10 years and never have had the opportunity to until last night.
5172693	5176615	And that was I went and saw Showgirls in a theater.
5178176	5182677	It was... Mystique is laughing.
5182737	5183337	No, here's the thing.
5183557	5184657	Wait, wait, Mystique, Mystique.
5185017	5185577	Where's Mystique?
5185597	5187978	Mystique, get in here for a minute, because I have to tell you about this.
5188518	5190278	Okay, get Mystique a mic.
5190658	5191598	Get in here, Mystique.
5191638	5195059	You actually paid to see Showgirls?
5195099	5195839	Yes, I paid.
5196439	5197679	Actually, no, I got Alan to pay.
5198039	5202420	Alan paid $15 a ticket.
5202460	5203280	No, this isn't in there.
5203500	5205541	Okay, so we're at the Castro Theater, right?
5206261	5207181	Right in the heart...
5209116	5209256	Boobies!
5209276	5209796	Boobies everywhere!
5209816	5210116	Boobies!
5210156	5212097	You saw that movie when it came out!
5236906	5241408	Which is funny because, you know, I'm gay and all, but boobies are great.
5241608	5243788	Why is it with gay guys and boobs?
5243888	5245069	I've talked to a lot of gay guys.
5245149	5246209	They like boobs.
5246369	5247630	We like to call them fun bags.
5249810	5250591	That's what they are.
5251771	5252771	I call mine jubbles.
5254432	5255152	Do you name your boobs?
5255372	5256773	They're just jubbles.
5257913	5259213	But there's two of them, right?
5259253	5260694	You don't have a uniboob, do you?
5260914	5263135	No, they're the twins, but I just call them my jubbles.
5263375	5263995	Okay, I see.
5264315	5265296	Alright, that works, that works.
5265516	5267957	Do you name your boobies, DarkSakura?
5269959	5272120	One's don't touch me there, and two is stop it.
5275082	5275402	Lies.
5276183	5278464	I call them Lefty and Righty.
5278484	5280646	Shut up!
5280846	5284348	I had a girlfriend, yes, believe it or not, when I was like 16.
5284428	5287190	See, I'm not surprised about that either.
5287410	5288411	Her name was Chuck.
5288611	5290332	No, no, shut up.
5292249	5298154	She named her boobies, and her boobies' names, get this, I am not making this up, were Pebbles and Bam Bam.
5300696	5301236	Wow.
5302377	5303037	How was their names?
5303978	5304438	Wow.
5304799	5306900	And now we know why Rob is gay.
5308982	5309602	You know what, though?
5309943	5313165	If dudes can name their junk, women can name their tits.
5314866	5315566	That's very true.
5315847	5316707	It's a free country.
5317648	5321131	Mine are just my boobs.
5321151	5321671	The girls.
5322272	5323013	Misty?
5323253	5324013	I'm not even going to ask.
5324874	5326776	She'll throw that bottle of Mountain Dew at me.
5328097	5328477	Let's see.
5328917	5331640	Why would I waste Mountain Dew like that?
5331660	5332941	Frisbee says kibbles and bits.
5333421	5334262	Alright.
5337981	5339922	I want to know great boob names.
5339982	5342644	Like, I know that has nothing to do with gaming, but I don't care.
5343725	5344646	I need to know good boob names.
5344666	5346147	I know Joe Diaz says hers are named.
5347447	5349409	Wait, what are... She's not saying what they are.
5349429	5350510	Oh, bummer.
5351150	5352871	Come on, you open that bag.
5353151	5354012	Now let the cat out.
5356433	5359856	Tiger Claw says you could just call them beanbags because you know you want to sleep on top of them.
5360156	5362197	That actually is one really good use of boobies.
5363198	5369323	Sometimes when you're watching a movie and cuddling with a fag hag, there's boobies that you can rest your weary head on.
5370924	5371725	I think boobs are great.
5372385	5375028	Do you know that they actually sell boob pillows in Japan?
5375048	5377309	I've seen the hand pillows.
5380962	5381403	DarkSakura.com
5401688	5430685	let's see she said my left one is named righty and the right one is named lefty so the guy doesn't get confused SSJ100 Matt says in chat see see see the religious fanatics and gays can both agree on the fact that boobs are fun you know what we do you know all this this prop I can see your dirty pillows what didn't you see Carrie do not want oh years ago years ago they're all gonna laugh at you all right
5432530	5436733	Let's get into... Let's derail the show further, shall we?
5436973	5437414	And how.
5437614	5439055	Alright, let's get into Twitter topics.
5439115	5442538	Let's let the listeners control the show with topics for a little bit.
5443158	5443759	Sweet!
5447001	5449824	You can't run out to get a taco while we're trying to do Twitter topics.
5449844	5450945	She ran out to get a taco.
5451285	5451926	This is not...
5452884	5453784	Taco Topics.
5453864	5454945	It's Twitter Topics.
5455005	5456765	Taco Time.
5457045	5457385	Let's go.
5457445	5458065	Twitter Topics.
5458526	5458806	Alright.
5459106	5459466	You ready, Dan?
5459526	5460166	I'm ready.
5460286	5460866	There's a game.
5461106	5463807	Robocoon gets our first Taco Topic tonight.
5464387	5469068	Saying that there is a game called Privates that is now out on the PC.
5469548	5470769	This is the sex game.
5471509	5471629	What?
5471949	5487477	Yes, this is the one where, like, I think you play these little spermy condom-looking guys, and, yeah, you have a Windows computer, and you can download this game now, and I guess it's a game that teaches you about... six.
5487657	5488678	Does it work with Kinect?
5490179	5491139	No, it's a PC game.
5491759	5492160	For now.
5494141	5494641	You never know.
5496041	5500030	Let's see, TigerClaw305 sends us lots and lots of links tonight.
5500050	5501654	We're going to do a couple of these here.
5502054	5502576	First off...
5504145	5505645	I think this is actually really cool.
5505725	5509026	All joking and laughing and boob talk aside, this is actually a really great story here.
5509386	5512467	The Kinect is going to be able to recognize sign language.
5512747	5514388	As long as you're not sitting on the couch.
5516488	5523090	The Kinect will actually recognize American sign language, and it's due to a patent, I guess, that's out there.
5523810	5528412	If you are proficient in sign language, you can actually get the Xbox 360 to recognize sign language.
5529372	5529732	I know a sign.
5529752	5531173	I know how to say bitch in sign language.
5531193	5531554	I bet you do.
5531574	5531934	All right.
5559561	5561502	Also, I'm sure we know the same one, Dan.
5561863	5564804	This is less awesome, but this is something that Tiger Claw sends.
5564864	5565945	It must be reported on.
5566005	5566585	It is news.
5567346	5569827	Billy Mitchell has taken back the Donkey Kong record.
5570087	5570647	Both of them.
5570887	5573409	It happened on August 7th, 2010.
5573469	5576551	He reclaimed Donkey Kong and Donkey Kong Jr.
5576871	5579112	Billy Mitchell is laying the smackdown.
5579415	5584097	It happened at Boomers Grand Prix Arcade in Florida, verified live by Twin Galaxies refs.
5598243	5598783	That's it.
5599344	5601625	Two hours and 42 minutes for Donkey Kong.
5601685	5603786	Three hours and 58 minutes for Donkey Kong Jr.
5605226	5606107	I think I like this.
5606607	5610969	He stopped right after he got past Hank Chien's score.
5611549	5614671	And Mitchell said, quote, Some say I'm being cocky.
5615051	5616492	Some say I'm being lazy.
5617032	5619173	I say I'm being Billy Mitchell.
5619593	5622835	Well, because he wants to have that record broken again.
5624246	5632815	He wants to be able to keep one-upping it because he really does know that he is that much better than everybody else at Donkey Kong.
5634877	5638180	Whether you love Mitchell or you hate him, and you know you hate him.
5638420	5639701	Everybody hates Billy Mitchell.
5640362	5645147	The guy is the best in the world at that game.
5647251	5653013	SSJ100 Matt sends us a tweet about NHL 11 because we love sports games here at OLR.
5653033	5654933	There's nothing we love more than sports games.
5655113	5655794	And how.
5655914	5660295	But I will say, if I'm going to play a sports game, why are there all these giggling women in the other room?
5660555	5663656	Because Mystique's on the phone with our friend Beanie and Beanie said they had tacos too.
5664276	5664596	Nice.
5664896	5665896	Is it taco day?
5665976	5667157	It is taco day.
5667217	5670157	Actually, the people in front of us at the supermarket were buying the ingredients.
5670197	5671878	We're buying the stuff to make Mexican food.
5672677	5673978	Did I miss the memo?
5674098	5675598	I was not aware it was Taco Day.
5675618	5677179	I thought Taco Day was Tuesday.
5677239	5678139	Because you're here.
5678739	5680680	You know who started that branding?
5680800	5681000	Huh?
5681280	5681500	Me.
5682041	5682281	Did you?
5682521	5683481	I started Taco Tuesday.
5684081	5684722	I don't know.
5684762	5686502	I think there'd be some folks who might argue with that.
5686742	5687383	Nope, I did it.
5687623	5687863	All right.
5689483	5690084	and the internet.
5690104	5691345	Can I talk about NHL 11?
5691565	5691825	Yes.
5692065	5693066	All right, NHL 11.
5693586	5695008	There is download content.
5695068	5698410	It's all priced between 80 and 160 Microsoft points.
5698891	5705236	They're like, I guess, player boosts where you can actually like give yourself high boosts of five and one and three and so forth.
5705556	5710480	Get this, 156 different pieces of download content.
5710540	5712902	Because EA doesn't have enough money.
5713723	5716185	And they also, well, they need it to buy a soul.
5718106	5718546	Yeah, whatever.
5718586	5719206	Apparently.
5719787	5721487	What would EA do with a soul but sell it?
5721507	5721847	I don't know.
5721867	5723408	That's kind of screwed up, I guess.
5723428	5724448	For more Madden rights.
5724808	5727329	Because really, you're paying to basically make your characters better.
5729269	5729569	Alright.
5729670	5730590	Learn to play.
5732150	5735791	SSJ100 Matt in our chat says, Hockey is being derailed for tacos.
5735931	5736692	Oh, the humanity.
5737072	5737532	Hacos.
5739429	5744216	Frisbee gets kudos for saying Billy Mitchell, I'm number one at making sauce.
5744757	5745718	Taco's own hockey.
5745738	5748583	Billy Mitchell, I'm saucy!
5749985	5751788	For real, he sells sauce on the internet.
5753132	5756954	I love the idea of a new sport called Hakos or Taki.
5760116	5762378	And it would be hockey played with tacos.
5763098	5765059	But they have to be like, you know, steel tacos.
5765339	5766180	Yeah.
5766360	5767721	Steel tacos.
5768241	5769442	Blades of tacos.
5769922	5771383	Blades of tacos.
5771983	5772263	I got it.
5772343	5774024	I got it.
5774064	5776326	They skate on tacos.
5779027	5779748	That would get messy.
5781029	5781549	But that would be fun.
5782970	5784852	I'm just getting into Dreamcast import gaming.
5809551	5812092	Boy, you're about 15 years late now.
5812192	5812732	I'm kidding.
5812752	5813812	You want Blue Stinger.
5814232	5818534	What DC games not already out in the US somehow are worth importing?
5818954	5823415	The only Dreamcast imports I've got are Fire Pro Wrestling D and Giant Graham 2000.
5824095	5825816	Which means he spent eight bucks.
5827637	5829517	He probably downloaded them off the inner tubes.
5829677	5832658	Actually, the Japanese version of Blue Stinger is better than the US one.
5832738	5835659	The Japanese version of Blue Stinger is much better than the US one.
5836559	5838342	What about, isn't it the Japanese?
5838422	5839263	No, that was on the Saturn.
5839283	5841466	I was thinking Symphony of the Night, but that's on the Saturn.
5841486	5842207	Yeah, that's on the Saturn.
5842728	5844731	What other import awesome Dreamcast games are there?
5847361	5848461	DarkSakura's going to the vault.
5848621	5850281	There's almost too many to go into.
5851742	5854483	While DarkSakura runs to the vault, I will take other tweets.
5854623	5856683	She's going to come back with a bunch of terrible suggestions.
5857023	5859084	Spazinator sends us a tweet.
5859684	5863105	Apparently it's a leaked video of the Castlevania Lords of Shadow game.
5863425	5864385	Oh, ha ha ha.
5864465	5866266	He tried to rickroll us, but I had it on mute.
5866326	5872247	That's why I usually don't click on YouTube links, but he cleverly disguised it behind a bit.
5872607	5872868	Kick him.
5874708	5876370	I can't kick somebody off Twitter.
5876410	5877512	If I could, I would for that.
5878413	5879574	No, I mean just kick him.
5880275	5882838	I think everything in this box came out in the U.S.
5884981	5887684	And why do we have two copies of Capcom vs. SNK?
5888845	5889987	Because we're that awesome?
5890107	5892550	No, one of them's the Pro Edition.
5892921	5893342	DJ Blaziken No
5908342	5909502	Neither has anybody else.
5909782	5915284	Well, apparently there is actually out there in the world an 8-bit version of DJ Hero.
5915584	5916345	This is the same guy.
5916385	5918425	He downgraded some other games on the NES, too.
5918725	5919466	Here it is, folks.
5921346	5923867	These videos are always so bad it gives me cancer.
5931789	5933490	What song is this?
5933530	5934650	Hang in tough.
5934730	5935891	What song is this?
5936291	5936791	I don't know.
5938843	5939363	Oh, it's Queen.
5945889	5947810	This game sucks bad.
5948571	5949191	Nobody bought it.
5950632	5952894	Well, it's not... You don't buy it, Dan.
5952934	5953414	It's a hack.
5953474	5955876	Or not a hack, but a... No, I'm just talking about DJ Hero.
5957077	5959379	You have no idea how hard I tried to sell that game.
5959839	5960900	You know what made it sell?
5961020	5962481	When it went down to like 80% off?
5962522	5964363	It sold like crazy and now it's a hit.
5964583	5965244	People bought it.
5966204	5966445	Anyhow.
5967563	5968123	One more tweet.
5968143	5969524	Can I do one more tweet?
5969544	5975306	By the way, I did go through the box, and I think everything that we have in the box came out in the U.S., but P.O.P.O.
5975326	5976407	Da, I really like that game.
5976607	5977267	Hydra Thunder.
5977968	5978228	All right.
5978708	5980289	It still not imports, Dan, you dork.
5980389	5983190	Well, you can't say it and give Blue Swim at least, like, one or two suggestions.
5983470	5983750	All right.
5984811	5985191	Let's see.
5985211	5986311	Orange right.
5988516	5994238	I like that name because it almost makes it sound like it should be Orange LR is right or something like that.
5994538	6001761	Orange Right sends a tweet saying Konami is going to have a DDR party at Royal Tea Cafe to celebrate their first DDR for the PS3.
6002122	6004543	Naoki will be there live DJing.
6004683	6005903	I did hear about this actually.
6006643	6008064	Too far away or I would want to go.
6008224	6010505	Yeah, it's in Culver City, California, which is in SoCal.
6010545	6014827	It's a little far, especially for a weeknight because it's on August 12th, which is like this week.
6015547	6017808	But hey, if we have folks in the area, by all means, go.
6018308	6019770	I'm going to try to send DJ Tyrant.
6019950	6022753	He's in SoCal and he's done some freelancing for the website.
6022773	6025516	So I'll see if he can go and cover this for us.
6025937	6026698	We don't have jobs.
6026738	6027218	We're going.
6028231	6028992	No, I'm just kidding.
6029112	6033194	We ain't got no money.
6033254	6034175	Oh, I know.
6034215	6035736	You could use the show funds.
6036116	6036977	Oh, wait.
6037137	6038098	We don't have show funds.
6038978	6040319	I've been too poor to donate.
6041160	6042801	We had show funds once.
6043061	6044122	Now we have a soundboard.
6044142	6045422	Now we have a soundboard, exactly.
6045763	6047504	And I got to go to California Extreme two years ago.
6047584	6047964	All right.
6048344	6050085	TigerClaw saying I missed one of his tweets.
6050125	6050846	I'm sorry, TigerClaw.
6050866	6051967	There's a two-tweet maximum.
6052007	6052467	Too bad.
6052487	6053187	That's the problem.
6054088	6055109	How does it feel, huh?
6055409	6055649	Huh?
6057171	6059092	I appreciate what Tiger Claws does for the show.
6059192	6061754	I do, but I have to spread... It's not the Tiger Claws segment.
6061854	6064577	It's the Twitter Claws segment.
6064617	6065878	I actually said the Twitter Claws segment.
6065898	6067179	It is now the Tiger Claws segment.
6068300	6068600	Alright.
6069401	6070622	Just totally missed my point.
6070802	6072103	The Tiger Claw contingency.
6072163	6072463	Alright.
6073504	6075044	How about more news, shall we?
6075545	6076005	How about it?
6095117	6097319	Hold on, I have to, sorry for the dead air, but I have to bring this up.
6097339	6101923	Like, I need, I need music if I'm going to report on a story from Waterloo Labs here.
6101963	6104205	This is mandatory that I have a story here.
6110892	6116737	My, my, at Waterloo, they'll steal your fucking eyeballs.
6117077	6119359	All right, no, seriously, Waterloo Labs.
6120327	6127867	They have developed an electrode system that actually measures your eye movement and uses it to control Super Mario Bros.
6129571	6130071	That's right.
6130151	6131191	So look at this dude here.
6131251	6132292	He actually has his eyes.
6132652	6135453	Actually, I'll stop the ABBA here for a minute and the listeners rejoice.
6136113	6138073	And you can actually watch this guy in this little video here.
6138093	6138273	Hey, guys.
6138373	6139574	Welcome to Waterloo Labs.
6140114	6142955	This time we're going to use electrodes, LabVIEW, and a single board.
6143055	6143455	All right.
6143475	6144795	Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
6144835	6147656	It looks like they're in like a garage.
6148136	6150197	Not like a garage like at your house.
6150897	6153618	It's like when we were at the OLR studio.
6154138	6155798	We are at the OLR studio.
6156058	6157919	And it's just a spare bedroom.
6158179	6158519	Right.
6160530	6160870	All right.
6160890	6161490	Why?
6161510	6163311	But it doesn't look like these guys are in, like, their garage.
6163331	6165372	It looks like they're in, like, a mechanic's garage.
6165472	6166112	It's hilarious.
6166172	6168993	I don't want to see these guys, like, just talk about their stupid device.
6169033	6169514	I want to see that.
6169534	6169894	There we go.
6169914	6170494	There's the guy playing.
6170594	6171054	Oh, my God.
6171094	6173935	He actually looks up to jump, and the guy does jump.
6175216	6178317	That is... And they kind of move their head a little bit, though.
6178337	6179037	That's kind of cheating.
6179057	6179298	I don't know.
6179318	6180558	I bet he can't get to the minus world.
6181618	6184900	I'd like to see him run through 8-1, always running like that.
6185620	6186640	That is freaky to me.
6186660	6186781	Oh, see?
6186801	6187241	Look at him die.
6187421	6187941	I was doing something.
6188666	6189927	Boo!
6190267	6192229	Now, Rob, though, you know they've had this before?
6192989	6193210	What?
6193270	6194311	The Atari Mind Link.
6194871	6195712	It never worked.
6196012	6201016	Yeah, Atari in the 80s marketed a controller that was going to play by your brain waves.
6201476	6204659	But it actually played by the way that you moved your head.
6204959	6205579	Like your forehead?
6205860	6206140	Yeah.
6206600	6207141	Ah, so it was a gimmick.
6207161	6208262	It worked on your eyebrow muscles.
6208602	6209663	It was snake oil.
6210003	6210543	Exactly.
6210663	6211324	Never released.
6211584	6212005	It was a...
6213516	6214836	Famous, famous vaporware.
6215216	6218377	I don't think Waterloo Labs actually plans to do anything with this.
6218397	6218897	Waterloo!
6219217	6219977	I know, right?
6220437	6221557	Napoleon did surrender.
6221817	6222518	Napoleon.
6224958	6230739	Whatever, it made for a great YouTube and got their little lab all over blogs and on our show, so congrats, there you go.
6231959	6242181	This website, though, that I've tried to find the picture on, it actually shows some Atari wireless controllers that have these big antennas and this thing, and then an orthopedic shoe, and it's labeled, which one is the orthopedic shoe?
6244527	6252756	It looks like somebody in our chatroom, MOTC, I don't know if that's short for something, sorry, is like going crazy trying to get the DDR event information.
6252816	6255679	So if you're going, I want a phone call next week, dude.
6257361	6261986	And by the way, Orange Wright actually joined our chatroom and actually changed the name to Orange LR is right.
6262026	6262446	So there we go.
6263207	6263507	All right.
6264408	6265029	Thank you very much.
6265049	6265329	Appreciate it.
6265369	6266150	Well done, sir.
6266330	6266771	Well done.
6267771	6273613	and Tiger Claw, like the Google Ninja he is, right there with the Wikipedia article to the Atari Mine link.
6274274	6276555	I want to see a picture of this thing and see if it was scary looking.
6277235	6278476	I posted one in the chat room.
6278516	6279816	Go to the Atari History Museum.
6279996	6280576	Hold on, hold on.
6281697	6282777	The link is on the Wikipedia.
6282797	6284178	Hold on, I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm on it.
6285799	6289700	Let's see.
6289820	6290621	Oh, I see it, there it is.
6291221	6292381	That looks dumb.
6293462	6294262	It was.
6294282	6295263	That made for great radio.
6295283	6295823	It never worked.
6297230	6297450	Mind Maze
6311286	6312047	SkipSchool.
6312127	6312548	No, I'm kidding.
6312568	6312988	I'm kidding.
6313108	6313469	I'm kidding.
6313549	6313849	I'm kidding.
6313869	6314270	I'm kidding.
6314851	6317434	All right, DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
6317775	6318295	Stuff.
6319777	6322601	Actually, this is something that perhaps Dan might be interested in.
6323061	6323402	Maybe.
6324003	6324423	Maybe.
6325905	6329410	Well, actually, he couldn't do anything with it because it's only for Europe.
6330370	6336976	Gran Turismo 5, the European special editions, have two special editions, actually.
6337416	6339818	There's the signature edition that's like the U.S.
6339858	6340659	collector's edition.
6341139	6344682	It has a metal case, a miniature SLS AMG.
6345763	6347184	It comes with a toy car.
6348425	6348906	Model car.
6349426	6350807	It comes with a V6 engine.
6352148	6367321	A USB flash drive, a wallet, and an entry into a contest to win a Mercedes-Benz, and vouchers for 11 download content vehicles, a key fob, an art book, a driving strategy mini magazine, and it's going to be €179.99.
6369343	6370865	There's another special edition, too.
6371125	6372026	It's all that stuff.
6372606	6375709	It comes with the trunk of a Z06 Corvette, and it costs $70,000.
6378610	6382412	And then there's another one if you don't have as much money, which is €79.99.
6383253	6396741	It's the collector's edition that has a slipcover, some art cards, the download content vouchers, and the driving magazines that came with the other version.
6397381	6405286	So you can decide if you want to have the cool version or the, oh my god, can I win the Mercedes version?
6405726	6407127	Well, let's keep in mind, that's Euro.
6407447	6407647	Yeah.
6407807	6411448	So that's like, what, a buck and a half, a buck seventy-five per Euro?
6411589	6414890	Or you could just buy the goddamn game by itself and be happy with it.
6415150	6416270	I'll do the conversion right now.
6417471	6418291	I want to get the U.S.
6418351	6420332	Collector's Edition, but I don't think I'm going to spring for it.
6420352	6420912	What's in the U.S.
6420932	6421593	Collector's Edition?
6423454	6431457	It comes with a toy car, a bunch of DLC, art book, a book, a soundtrack, just all kinds of stuff.
6432137	6433958	And I like Gran Turismo, and I'm like...
6434306	6435929	Yeah, yeah, I'll do that.
6435949	6436850	Then I'm like, what?
6436930	6438052	It's like $150.
6439053	6439815	Jesus, no.
6441177	6441477	All right.
6442118	6445003	Going to another game that's coming out later this year here in the U.S.
6445043	6445523	and the U.K.
6445824	6447066	I think it's in the U.K.
6447086	6447346	this year.
6447366	6447787	Hmm?
6450089	6451251	240 bucks to DarkSakura.
6451271	6451852	Got some money.
6452372	6458321	Alright, hey, a new mode in GoldenEye that kind of throws you back to an old mode.
6458361	6458801	Here's the thing.
6459082	6463488	There used to be a mode, if you remember, in GoldenEye on the N64, it was called DK mode.
6463788	6466692	And that was the mode where you would all have the giant heads.
6467793	6471815	It made all the enemies and people in the game have these gigantic heads.
6472236	6475377	And they all had what they would call the proportions of Donkey Kong.
6475637	6481360	Because at that time, Rare was making, of course, this game and they were making the Donkey Kong games on Super Nintendo, right?
6481440	6483301	So is Donkey Kong mode coming back?
6484001	6485282	No, of course not, stupid.
6485302	6488624	Because Activision has the rights now and they don't own the rights to Donkey Kong.
6488924	6490124	So it's not coming back.
6490605	6496628	But what they did, and this is clever, they've decided to do, instead of big heads, they now have...
6497248	6498710	Big Hands!
6499291	6513771	That's right, there's a Big Hands mode that can be activated in multiplayer and you get Big Hands and this is it, you can only melee people so it is bitch slap mode basically you can only bitch slap the other players with your giant hands that is what it is
6515979	6516319	Awesome.
6516940	6521885	There also, by the way, is a mode that makes everybody tiny that I believe was in the old game as well.
6521945	6523707	There's a knick-knack mode is what it's called.
6524247	6529353	Am I alone in being a lot less interested in that game when they're like, yeah, we're going to redo Goldeneye.
6529713	6530434	Yay!
6530834	6533857	Oh, we're going to take Pierce Brosnan out and we're going to put Daniel Craig in.
6534518	6535138	Oh, yeah, that's...
6536785	6537466	That's interesting.
6537526	6538267	That's not a big deal.
6538507	6538988	Whatever.
6540409	6541510	Those Bond movies were fine.
6541630	6542932	The new ones were fine.
6543572	6544053	They're awesome.
6544073	6546055	But Goldeneye is Brosnan's movie.
6546996	6548858	I know, it's weird, but you know.
6549178	6551681	And then the whole thing is likeness rights.
6552041	6554383	I played it at E3, and I'll just say it doesn't even matter.
6554403	6555685	Brosnan's a whore for money.
6556065	6559629	It's all about Oddjob anyway, because he throws the hat, and it's awesome.
6560650	6562010	This is a shoe, honestly.
6562070	6562591	Honestly.
6563031	6564111	You fight like a woman.
6564891	6570032	Frisbee in our chatroom is a little upset saying you can't claim ownership on big heads and hands, etc.
6571053	6573133	Maybe it was just they just didn't want to go there.
6574534	6576294	It's too close or something.
6576314	6578595	The conglomerate that owns what's left of Midway should sue.
6580040	6580881	Except it was a rare game.
6581502	6581883	Not Midway.
6582003	6585428	Right, but Midway, the big heads thing came along at NBA Jam.
6586489	6587931	Oh, true.
6587951	6589393	Back to NBA Jam again.
6589573	6590234	Shut up, Dan.
6590575	6590835	Alright.
6592583	6593083	Shut up, Dan.
6593123	6594184	Let's do another news story.
6594664	6598807	Well, for those who are looking forward to Pokemon Black and White, they haven't already... Hey, Dan, here you go.
6599307	6599807	Woo, Pokemon.
6599827	6600407	And how.
6601068	6602609	They haven't already imported it.
6603309	6606031	Sorry.
6607852	6612254	When you play through it the first time, until you beat it, you can only use the new Pokemon.
6612834	6614135	You don't get the old Pokemon.
6614815	6615416	No, Pika.
6616236	6616797	What the hell?
6616837	6617257	Pika.
6618345	6619146	Not until you beat the game.
6619926	6620967	Then you can get some people.
6621367	6623048	Look, I understand why they're fighting.
6623068	6625710	Like, there's a lot of fucking Pokemon at this point, right?
6625730	6627031	Like, how many Pokemon are there now?
6627071	6628912	Like, 700 fucking Pokemon or something?
6628932	6630593	Like, it's just, it's insane.
6630613	6632474	And they're all starting to be like parodies of each other.
6633135	6641300	I would actually sympathize with Nintendo if they wanted to say, hey, look, new game, new system, new, or actually, did they have another DS?
6641340	6641581	Whatever.
6641901	6644683	New way of playing, new game, new Pokemon.
6645083	6646564	Stop asking for the old shit.
6646624	6647825	I still want an actual Pokemon MMO.
6648585	6652349	But it's weird that they kind of put the Pokemon in there anyway at the end.
6652370	6653771	But I guess it's a reward to beat the game.
6654552	6654892	I guess.
6654912	6655253	There you go.
6655893	6657255	I still want a Pokemon MMO.
6657315	6657896	I would play that.
6658216	6662461	Every time there's a Pokemon story on this show, somebody says, why don't they make this an MMO already?
6662841	6663722	That's a very good question.
6663742	6665124	Because a Pokemon Momo would work.
6666305	6667386	A Pokemon Momo?
6668708	6669488	Is that like a Moo Moo?
6669629	6669749	Momo.
6669769	6669849	Momo.
6671946	6673387	A Pokemon MMO would be great.
6673507	6673888	It would be.
6673988	6681614	But it would be weird because Nintendo, in their mission to protect children across the world with friends codes, how in the hell would an MMO work?
6682175	6684817	And they keep it like kid-friendly, quote-unquote.
6684837	6688320	Would it be like the Disney game where you can only say certain phrases to people?
6689041	6689301	I don't know.
6689321	6690262	It would have to be what would happen.
6690642	6691543	That ain't my problem.
6691823	6693565	I just think that a Pokemon MMO would work.
6693965	6694546	Oh, well, okay.
6695163	6695964	Screw the kids.
6696344	6696685	That's right.
6696725	6697406	Screw the kids.
6697666	6698367	That's right, Misty.
6698447	6704874	I would play the Pokemon MMO while I ate my Nintendo cereal system and my Nintendo pajamas.
6705594	6706295	It'd be awesome.
6707637	6707937	Amen.
6708936	6710237	I have a broken computer.
6728796	6729497	And you're a fool.
6748390	6753853	Torchlight 2 is going to go above ground and it's now going to be on the continent of Vildoran.
6754193	6759856	There will still be deep caverns, but there will also be weather, time of day cycles, and random events.
6759876	6765159	You're going to be able to play online and, those of you that feel burned by Blizzard, LAN.
6765779	6767460	LAN parties for Torchlight 2.
6767520	6767960	There you go.
6768100	6768660	That's great.
6768680	6771322	It'll totally have features that every other game already has.
6771402	6772582	Except StarCraft 2.
6772682	6773223	Score!
6774241	6775904	No, you can't play StarCraft 2 in it.
6776485	6778068	Well, you can't play StarCraft 2 on LAN.
6778810	6780072	They took LAN out of StarCraft 2.
6780393	6781575	It's kind of a big deal.
6781595	6782877	Yeah, no, I know that.
6782917	6783779	Alright, just making sure.
6784383	6804575	there will be a free peer-to-peer matchmaking service to meet new players of similar level and interest now I had heard that they were going to do an MMO about this I guess that is also still in development it's a free-to-play Torchlight MMO this is not the same game but there is a multiplayer Torchlight game on the way in 2011 I think that's exciting to me I don't know about you guys
6805635	6806116	So there you go.
6806796	6807256	So sweet.
6807577	6807877	All right.
6808357	6811419	Well, now is the mailbag part of the show, except Jamie's not here.
6811559	6815021	So we're going to set the mailbag on fire, ladies and gentlemen.
6815061	6817382	Damn, where did I put my lighter?
6821785	6827868	Every week, DarkSakura opens up the email bag at mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com and she reads some emails for us.
6827928	6830610	We listen to them live as she reads them for us.
6830630	6832991	So DarkSakura, why don't you go ahead and read us an email?
6836954	6838075	This is some great radio right here.
6838095	6838315	What?
6838856	6839236	Mailbag.
6839256	6839617	Mailbag.
6840097	6840898	No, it's not mailbag.
6840918	6841638	I had another story.
6842780	6843340	Not anymore.
6844181	6844461	No.
6844801	6845282	The music's playing.
6845302	6845762	Read the mail.
6846663	6847064	Hey, come on.
6847104	6847544	Get to it.
6847564	6847824	Fine.
6848525	6848905	Fine.
6848965	6849386	Mail time.
6850447	6850867	You know what?
6850887	6851268	Mail call.
6852869	6853310	Land shark.
6855251	6856352	Mail call beats a booty call.
6858194	6858635	Hey, how you doing?
6858975	6861637	The window's actually closed and I don't know who closed it, so whatever.
6861858	6862138	It was me.
6865379	6866200	Okay, we can go with that.
6866940	6869381	Dan, why don't you pretend you're emailing Orange Lounge Radio?
6869402	6871043	What would you say in an email to Orange Lounge Radio?
6871183	6871703	Email's up.
6872003	6872844	Dear Rob.
6873344	6873944	Shut up, Dan.
6874024	6875505	Dan should be on this show way more often.
6875525	6876346	For real, Dan, shut up.
6876446	6878107	He is so cool and such a pimp.
6878752	6883457	Your little OLR crew, Blade3 here, just wanted to say keep up the great work with the shows.
6884317	6885378	I can't... Shows?
6885879	6886760	We have more than one show?
6887200	6888101	I can't live without them.
6888541	6891644	Your show-wa, not shows, show-wa.
6892205	6892946	I'd like more shows.
6893826	6897350	Keep my week going, and with school starting this week, I'll need you more than ever.
6897390	6901634	And by the way, PlayStation Move is stupid, and I think Loki should smack everyone who buys one when he gets back.
6901654	6901894	Thanks.
6903295	6903776	Punctuation.
6904113	6905374	Loki's never coming back.
6906015	6906655	Yes, he is.
6906695	6907216	He's coming.
6907236	6907916	The era of Dan has begun.
6908097	6908617	Oh, God.
6908697	6909778	Help us all.
6910419	6915263	Yeah, there's only one show, but I think he means shows as in, you know, there's been 377 episodes.
6915603	6920408	Although, I will say, Extifer and I really want to do the other show, and I think I have a great concept now.
6920448	6920968	And we still...
6922509	6948864	now that I don't have school on the nights you had available I would like to do that still, it would be fun I want to do a show the Dan show not by myself what would a Dan show sound like if Dan was by himself with a microphone I have a mic words see the Dan and Mystique show oh shit all who oppose us would perish
6950669	6951690	Second email!
6951870	6954152	Greetings, number one show in the continental US.
6955113	6955393	Thank you.
6955493	6956514	We're the greatest in the galaxy.
6956734	6958435	Yeah, we're actually the greatest in the galaxy.
6958975	6961577	Although, when we had that decree... Do you have the decree?
6961957	6962358	Yes, I do.
6962538	6964800	The decree does not say the number one.
6965380	6966701	It just says the official.
6966721	6967662	I had tape stuck to it.
6969980	6970680	But I'll take number one.
6970700	6971741	What is going on over there?
6971861	6972681	Official decree.
6972801	6976662	Orange Lounge Radio is the official video game podcast of the galaxy forever.
6976682	6977902	Galaxy forever.
6978163	6981664	It doesn't say number one video game podcast, but it is the official video game podcast.
6981684	6986865	Now that we have been voted the number one show in the continental U.S., I guess Hawaii would beat us or something.
6987045	6989006	Meaning like all those one-up shows?
6989286	6989706	Unofficial.
6990286	6990666	Unofficial.
6990706	6991387	Not official.
6991627	6992267	GameSpot?
6992427	6992867	Unofficial.
6992967	6993627	Not official.
6993647	6994047	Giant Bomb?
6994167	6994888	It's not official.
6994908	6995588	Totally not official.
6996128	6997368	Reading the email.
6998089	7004090	I just heard a story on NPR about talks between Google and Verizon about paying extra for used bandwidth.
7004770	7009651	Decided that people who stream video, music, and especially online gamers will pay a lot extra for the bandwidth used.
7010171	7013352	This is very troubling to me since I'm an online gamer primarily.
7013752	7019094	Google seems to be the last straw, and if they give in, all the dominoes will start falling.
7019434	7024535	I'm wondering why I haven't heard more of an outcry from the gamer community about this bandwidth issue.
7025175	7032261	Since it has been behind the scenes for a while now, I also wonder what game studios and developers think of this.
7033322	7035663	I don't know what I'll do if rates go up anymore.
7035763	7036564	What do you guys think?
7038345	7040907	Honestly, you are the podcast that I look forward to all week.
7040947	7042689	You're loyal turtle in Philly.
7042849	7043369	Serious turtle.
7043389	7044370	Did you say turdy?
7045031	7047372	I was saying Philly when I said turtle, so shut up.
7047392	7049334	Wouldn't that come out as tilly?
7050652	7051372	Dan, you had a comment?
7069478	7097698	ultimately at the end of the day it's going to be your dollars that decide the other thing to keep in mind cable is slowly spreading through more and more neighborhoods and so forth and if you're also willing to make the sacrifice to go to something like DSL which might not be as fast perhaps there will be DSL competitors that are going to have an open internet that won't charge for this stuff AT&T still competes with Comcast still competes with neighborhood providers and so forth don't get me wrong folks I think this sucks too
7098779	7107968	but I'm just saying it might not be like you know eternal damnation for all of us I mean like there's going to be a limit that people are going to hit and they'll just cancel it
7108612	7109552	Well, because it's already started.
7109752	7112473	The phone companies are doing it, you know.
7113013	7119135	But there will always be somebody out there who's going to say, hey, you pay a little bit more and you can be unlimited.
7119655	7122096	The hope is that two things will happen.
7122156	7129157	Number one, competition will keep things cheap, you know, because there is more than one answer.
7129537	7134699	So if cable says, okay, we're charging you and DSL says, oh, no, we're not.
7135419	7163534	you know everybody will jump over to DSL and cable will lose all their money so they'll come back around the other thing that you're kind of looking at with the whole cable or with the whole unlimited bandwidth thing is that there are you know god help us government factions and that at work where the argument is that because the internet now is practically essential for life that they'll get involved to keep price gouging from happening you know
7164014	7190383	but who knows what's going to happen the truth is we're just going to have to gamers, online people the BitTorrent people who are the ones who are really screwed it up for everybody by sucking down massive amounts of bandwidth 24-7, 365 yeah, you heard that what's going to really happen is we're all going to have to deal with it and hopefully we don't get punked too hard
7191488	7194591	I would think they'd go after the Torrenters first, but I don't know.
7214304	7218870	Their other, you know, their movie studio, TV studio, whatever connections.
7219511	7221413	So, you know, they, yeah, they want the band.
7221553	7224777	Plus, you know, anything they can get away with charging us a little bit more money.
7224957	7226239	You know, they want that money.
7226920	7227841	Give me that money.
7228742	7229383	Give me all your money.
7229583	7230204	Give me all your money.
7230384	7231125	Give me your money.
7231826	7233948	Well that's, uh, is that it for the email bag tonight?
7234348	7234828	Yes it is.
7235008	7244195	Alright, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com if you want to send us an email in the future and hopefully you won't have to pay extra money through Comcast or whoever your service provider is to do so.
7244795	7245756	I know it's still free right now.
7247157	7251240	In the meantime, how about some angst, some anger, some F-U's.
7251480	7252381	Hold on, hold on, hold on.
7266901	7268262	F you to my software shield.
7269882	7270743	I defeated you!
7272323	7276465	And my hand for not being able to not hurt.
7277306	7278646	I'm about to go take some Vicodin.
7280727	7284449	My F you of the week goes to the fact that my weekend is almost over.
7284489	7289491	Because I actually had a pretty awesome weekend between, you know, Showgirls and other stuff.
7290031	7291152	Just, you know, I'm sad.
7291692	7292152	But whatever.
7293153	7293653	Life sucks.
7295600	7296581	Life sucks, you know?
7296942	7297583	Shit happens.
7297703	7297943	All right.
7299004	7300706	Misty, do you have FUs of the week?
7301908	7302369	Kind of.
7303410	7307074	It's just mostly to work drama and bullshit.
7307115	7308737	I'm not even going to name specific names.
7311580	7314484	Also to the fact that I have not won the lottery, so I can't move out here yet.
7315922	7317463	FU to not winning the lottery, I can sign up for that.
7317483	7317903	No doubt.
7318503	7320084	Dan, the man, do you have some FUs?
7320424	7322164	I gotta throw an FU out to the economy.
7323165	7324745	Believe it or not, I miss having a job.
7325946	7329987	Having a job was actually a great way to break up your day.
7333548	7336169	And besides that, no, not too many.
7337530	7338610	FU to all who oppose me.
7339630	7340191	Fuck you!
7341471	7342872	I will fucking kill you!
7343552	7344012	Back at ya.
7345582	7346923	Misty, are you saying you oppose Dan?
7346943	7347563	Don't oppose me.
7347723	7348123	Uh-oh.
7348604	7349844	We might have a throwdown.
7349864	7350945	No, just racial sarcasm.
7350965	7354887	Trust me, between now and Friday, I can make your life a living heck.
7355607	7355927	All right.
7357048	7357788	Not compared to work.
7358229	7362010	Before we get back into the gaming news, of which I have a story here, and then we're going to get to the Skype line.
7362030	7362571	That's amazing.
7362591	7362911	Soon.
7363471	7368374	Soon we will get to the Skype line, and then the callers call in, and it just all goes down from there.
7368794	7369054	All right.
7369574	7370075	I want to ask...
7371155	7374678	Misty though, what do you have planned for your week while you're here?
7374738	7375578	What are you going to do?
7376119	7378280	What stuff do you have to see?
7379301	7386366	Because I know when I think tourism I think Sacramento I think we should go to the zoo
7388623	7389263	That would be nice.
7390144	7395107	But yeah, mainly obligatory, our vagal time, sunrise for Parapara.
7395547	7397489	Feed Jamie to a giraffe if you go to the zoo.
7397969	7399070	No, no, no, red pandas.
7399730	7400531	Now why would I do that?
7400811	7401932	Dan maybe, but not Jamie.
7405874	7407135	Dan will get eaten by a grue.
7409717	7411198	Since when do they keep grues at zoos?
7411258	7412319	Are you guys going to go to San Francisco?
7414932	7418533	If we get enough people to help me with gas and parking... I think you guys will have fun.
7418973	7423594	Because, like Dan said, we're pretty broke, but... I don't know why your mic sucks, but... How about this?
7423854	7424395	Much better, yes.
7424715	7434257	If I have assistance with parking and everything and we eat cheap, and I don't completely blow my budget at Daiso, or IchibanCon, then...
7435902	7436122	Naya
7458806	7460228	The Gelato Place.
7460768	7461850	You can go to Naya and Berkeley.
7461870	7462731	You should go to Hot Cookie.
7463151	7463932	You know what Hot Cookie is?
7463992	7464693	It's the cookie store.
7464733	7465975	They sell cookies and underwear.
7467316	7468778	They sell cookies and panties.
7468838	7469779	That's really it.
7470260	7471441	Can't we just hit Yog-Yog?
7472783	7475226	Actually, Yog-Yog is right around the corner from my house.
7475826	7476267	Exactly.
7476547	7477869	I wish I could go with you gals, but...
7478999	7480660	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7501391	7523412	got bought this week and they sent out a release to their 17 million users saying quote X-Fire was bought by new owners today most of the team that has built X-Fire over the last six years is leaving we enjoyed working for you over the last 127 releases and wish we could stay to create the next 127 good luck and I'm sorry goodbye good luck and game on that's kind of uh
7524073	7526896	Tyton Gaming Skill Based Gaming Technology Money Competitive Gaming
7541892	7544635	Titan will be taking on the X-Fire name.
7544935	7548399	They're going to focus on ongoing innovation in the gaming space.
7548459	7551883	At least that's what the message says on their Titan website.
7552404	7553245	Quote, Interesting.
7563977	7570583	They're saying that this might be to try and position Titan Gaming to compete better with things like Virgin Gaming and so forth.
7570663	7576748	But I believe the sound you're going to hear right now is millions of users canceling their X-Fire accounts that they haven't already.
7576788	7577429	I'm going to be honest.
7578029	7580291	I haven't used X-Fire since Steam came out.
7580751	7581872	I was like, X-Fire?
7582213	7582553	Really?
7582573	7583173	I know.
7583754	7584354	They got bought?
7584414	7584955	Imagine that.
7584975	7587217	There it goes.
7588282	7594567	TigerClaw says if you go to Xfire.com you can watch a bunch of live streams of people playing on it and it's mostly wow.
7594707	7594947	Really?
7596108	7597669	Man, that's just what I want to see.
7597769	7602333	Well, let's go to Xfire.com right now and watch some a-holes play some wow.
7602393	7602653	Let's see.
7602673	7603974	We're going to go to Xfire.com.
7605495	7606075	Live radio.
7606135	7606556	I love this.
7606616	7607216	Actually, you know what?
7607236	7611139	We need some theme music as we go to Xfire.com that was recently purchased by Titan.
7611459	7612020	Benny Hill.
7617029	7618510	That song works for practically everything.
7618550	7619111	Videos.
7619291	7620392	Live videos.
7622033	7622614	Let's see here.
7622814	7624875	There's StarCraft 2 going on live.
7625476	7627778	Worst Rogue Priest in USA.
7627838	7629039	That doesn't even make sense.
7629639	7630360	How does that work?
7630760	7632121	There's some people doing arenas.
7632161	7634723	There's a heroic... Yeah, these are like all wow videos.
7636205	7636465	I don't know.
7636505	7636885	You want to look?
7636925	7637225	Let's see.
7637265	7639627	I want to see Worst Rogue Priest in the USA.
7642369	7642830	Where is it?
7644411	7644972	I clicked on it.
7645032	7645512	Nothing happened.
7648197	7649897	This is the worst segment ever.
7649957	7651598	Rob is fail at the internet.
7651618	7652158	Clearly.
7652438	7654519	Oh, because I clicked on the wrong link.
7654539	7655519	This website sucks.
7656099	7658140	All right, let's X-Fire live video.
7658340	7659560	So now you're blaming the website.
7659720	7661100	Shh, shh, shh.
7661300	7662401	We're going to snoop in, you guys.
7662961	7663721	Cyclone.
7668422	7669163	Cyclone.
7671163	7671543	Roots.
7671883	7673184	I'm casting Cyclone.
7673624	7674544	I'm casting Roots.
7677688	7684330	I got blind and... I'm getting drunk!
7684390	7689111	I fucking just fell asleep right there in that little... I mean, how much did they sell this website for?
7689151	7689811	40 bucks?
7689831	7691171	Because that's about what it's worth.
7692092	7693232	It's 20 more than I would have paid.
7695012	7699733	Although I've got to say, couldn't we just do our show on X-Fire?
7700854	7701534	Not anymore.
7703106	7708970	We could go on there and do a live WoW stream and be all like, Hi, you're listening to Orange Dawn Radio.
7709310	7710191	Cyclone.
7710551	7711972	Cyclone.
7711992	7712092	Roots.
7712793	7713933	Cyclone.
7714094	7715675	And Cyclone.
7716595	7717716	Magic missile.
7717736	7719938	I'm going to use intimidating shout.
7721699	7723160	That really is a WoW move, actually.
7723260	7724201	I know.
7726442	7728764	Dan only knows that from watching South Park.
7729864	7730205	All right.
7731030	7734374	No, no, see, I didn't work in a video game store for 10 years or nothing.
7735055	7737158	People might talk about Warcraft there.
7737218	7740422	In fact, I banned my assistant manager from talking about Warcraft.
7742458	7742838	DarkSakura
7770805	7772887	Well, Treasure, actually.
7774528	7777250	They are wanting to work on another 3D shooting game.
7777951	7784075	And if you have really good programming skills and live in Japan, you actually might be able to make it.
7784536	7789339	They have a job listing on their website looking for a new project 3D action shooting game.
7790520	7794003	And they are advertising.
7794043	7795864	Dude, we should send this actually to Krista.
7797585	7798586	Have her work for Treasure.
7800067	7801549	I'm surprised you're not applying for this.
7801609	7803150	I can't program shit.
7803951	7804892	You can learn fast.
7804912	7806593	I'm going to link this to Krista.
7806894	7810497	You could lie about your qualifications like in Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead.
7811057	7811698	That was great.
7812379	7813880	Oh, I see you graduated from Vassar.
7815161	7816222	I'm right on top of it, Rose.
7817543	7819225	You know I saw that in the theater.
7819285	7819665	Me too.
7819945	7821026	The dishes are done, man.
7822000	7824724	Why are we quoting a movie that's like 20 years old?
7824804	7826566	Because movies, like, are awesome.
7827848	7830972	We have some listeners that weren't even born yet when that movie came out.
7831313	7831793	Fuck them.
7832014	7834096	It's on DVD.
7835731	7836091	Maybe?
7837732	7839832	Well, they've put worse shit on DVD from what I hear.
7840332	7841913	I don't specifically know what, but yeah.
7842273	7842593	All right.
7843193	7844414	Let's talk StarCraft 2.
7844474	7845614	And how.
7845794	7846074	All right.
7846174	7852937	And Dan, you better be careful because, you know, this house is prone to getting these spy bots and these bad things in it.
7853437	7855737	And this is important to know about StarCraft 2.
7855857	7860319	Actually, this is actually halfway serious because there are a lot of phishing scams out there.
7860339	7863120	And I'm not talking about, like, phishing, like, you know,
7863840	7864401	Reel her in.
7864681	7866442	I'm talking fishing like P.H.
7866642	7867002	Wow.
7867282	7868864	I'm not like talking Dreamcast fishing.
7868984	7872826	The great thing is he's looking right at me when he's saying that like I'm not going to understand.
7872846	7874227	You need to understand.
7874327	7875428	No, Dan.
7875448	7879071	Why aren't you looking at DarkSakura over there?
7880151	7889138	Miss Spybot search and destroy herself who's downloaded 15 viruses in the time that we've watched the show and managed to kill them all.
7891749	7893311	and then she's looking at me like she's hurt.
7894051	7899156	She dumped like a gallon of bleach hypothetically into her computer to clean up any possible viruses.
7899316	7902279	Yeah, and you want to know exactly how I got rid of it actually?
7902780	7906163	I finally ended up doing a Windows search finding the DLLs and deleting them.
7907044	7908105	And what was the DLL called?
7908942	7909643	Fuck if I can remember.
7909683	7912124	There's also a few EXCs attached to it, but I got rid of them.
7912144	7913325	I thought it was called STD.
7914186	7917308	No, the STD one was one that was among the list of those.
7917688	7921411	But the things that I have are from like last year, all the instructions.
7921891	7923112	And the program has changed since.
7923432	7924513	So they've renamed all the stuff.
7924533	7925974	So I had to go back and refine them.
7926555	7928536	But I took care of it.
7928996	7930878	It's like a Pokemon, but STD.
7930898	7932339	Isn't that the oil that you put in your car?
7932359	7932919	And it was also actually...
7939464	7944928	Every time I would stop the process, it would restart the process through a different database builder that I had built in.
7944948	7948270	So I actually had to delete the database builder and the program.
7949411	7950151	And it's gone.
7951512	7952993	Did your computer become self-aware?
7954894	7955835	It touches itself, Rob.
7956590	7959152	Alright, can I move on talking about StarCraft 2?
7959232	7960432	It sure is aware of itself.
7960693	7961233	If you must.
7961373	7967096	Be wary because there are a lot of phishing emails going out there about certain StarCraft 2 promotions.
7967196	7977863	For example, if there's an email that you get about new free maps or a new mount for Warcraft, I guess this kind of crosses over, or any type of extra StarCraft 2 stuff.
7978543	7985370	They're trying to get your battle.net account info to try and get your activation key for the game.
7985450	7986391	So be careful.
7986431	7987973	There's a lot of phishing emails out there.
7988773	7991396	Obviously, it's been going on in World of Warcraft 4 forever.
7991736	8000084	Unfortunately, Blizzard hasn't really been able to fight it outside of the authenticator, which is a little silly that they've had to release this authenticator to protect accounts.
8000144	8000385	I mean...
8000825	8003066	But unfortunately, they're just so prone to getting hacked.
8003106	8004326	I mean, my own account was hacked.
8004627	8008608	I mentioned earlier in the show, you know, last year and it sucked.
8008728	8010769	It was it was kind of like virtual rape.
8011049	8016711	Like it was just my character was like somebody played my character played with my character when I didn't know.
8017211	8018432	It's just very sad.
8018703	8019284	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8032835	8034056	A lot of times they do that too.
8034116	8040640	In fact, there actually is a big login message in World of Warcraft now that says don't use the same password for Warcraft that you do any other website.
8040921	8043683	Because if they get your password for Warcraft, they'll get your other passwords too.
8047025	8047625	Why is that funny?
8047845	8060294	Because I could just see some guy putting in his password, which is undoubtedly password, for his bank account and his World of Warcraft and his, you know, everything.
8061254	8061895	And then being like,
8062816	8064498	Oh my god, I lost all my money.
8064959	8068944	Oh, but the real tragedy is they cleaned out my Warcraft character.
8069645	8070747	You deserve it.
8072774	8100562	nobody deserves to have their Warcraft character raped I'm sorry Rob I know that hit a little too close there may be a few people Monty Boggs in our chatroom says did he touch your character in the swimsuit area and I play a tauren for heaven's sakes yes he did touch the tauren in the swimsuit area that's how desperate these people are Frisbee in our chatroom says password 12345 to which Bonds006 says damn it now I have to go change my password
8100981	8102662	That's the same password I have on my luggage.
8105565	8113911	The great thing is I read somewhere in this last week that they're cracking down on people who are having relations in World of Warcraft now.
8114131	8115953	Why can't they go after these companies?
8115993	8120436	Like, I realize they're in another country or whatever, but isn't Blizzard established in a lot of these other countries?
8120476	8122138	Why don't they go after these guys legally?
8122438	8123779	I mean, it's a bad thing that they're doing.
8124195	8125817	Well, wait, wait, wait, wait.
8125917	8127980	They have roleplay servers for a reason.
8128701	8130143	Yeah, well, apparently they don't care.
8131024	8135210	Because some 10-year-old went wandering on one of those roleplay servers, I guess.
8135230	8139035	Yes, in a completely unrelated type of story, although I think that's what you're referring to.
8139695	8146499	Blizzard actually announced this week, kind of unofficially on the forums, they were going to patrol one of the servers a little more because of the roleplay.
8146699	8155083	This server's kind of known for being the adult roleplay server, and people like to roleplay in the tavern in Goldshire.
8155123	8155984	Right, that's what I read.
8156104	8157445	And I can't remember the name of the server.
8157485	8159606	You're in the tavern getting drunk!
8161022	8164565	If there's any girls there, I want to do them!
8165265	8170649	But what's amazing about RP servers is that there's just as many griefers as there are actual RPers.
8170949	8173491	So you can just imagine what these servers look like some days.
8174151	8176112	You know, that almost makes me want to play Warcraft.
8176953	8178114	You just want to be a griefer.
8178434	8178914	Oh, yes.
8179255	8181116	Oh, no, you want to do adult RP.
8181396	8181977	Admit it, Dan.
8182077	8183418	I could do adult RP at home.
8184738	8185319	Trust me.
8185359	8186319	Oh, really now?
8186359	8187280	Being an adult sucks.
8187300	8188600	I'd rather do 10-year-old RP.
8188620	8190381	They'd be like, why is your character sitting there on the ground?
8190441	8191041	I'm playing with G.I.
8191222	8191762	Joe's.
8192262	8193443	It's amazing.
8194023	8195104	Lance of Longinus.
8196584	8202387	If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8202507	8205249	The Skype line is open.
8205269	8207810	1-877-GAME-OLR or Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.
8207890	8209411	Call and harass Dan for me.
8210611	8211372	Game Oler.
8212012	8213753	We should have a segment called Make Dan Laugh.
8216167	8216427	Alright.
8217547	8218348	That's not that hard.
8219288	8219648	Let's see.
8219748	8221108	I'm known as Chuckles.
8221188	8224069	Yeah, SalaciousPop in our chat is following up with the details of the story there.
8224309	8227750	There's one particular roleplay server that has been earmarked for erotic chat.
8227810	8229250	Apparently it gets pretty explicit.
8229290	8230070	Dude, I want to play there.
8230270	8231351	I love the word erotic.
8231691	8234411	All level 5 toons in the human side start are in.
8235332	8241093	TigerClaw says, speaking of StarCraft, you have the story about Blizzard removing StarCraft 2 maps due to inappropriate content, right?
8241473	8242393	I did hear about that.
8242513	8245414	All the wang maps and penis looking maps and you know.
8245994	8250544	Quit making maps that look suggestive Attack your balls Alright
8255464	8258405	You have to defend your zone.
8259205	8259966	Let's be honest.
8260066	8263227	If the Zerg attack your groin, your day is ruined.
8263267	8270389	StarCraft 2 apparently has these crazy ass modes where you can make RP games.
8270930	8273451	Oh, erotic roleplay in StarCraft.
8273891	8274491	Coming soon.
8274611	8275191	Jesus.
8276272	8277052	Yes, my child.
8277092	8278592	Your soldiers are all really tiny.
8279633	8280173	Let's go to the phones.
8280193	8281313	I just don't see how that would be exciting.
8281393	8282474	Hi, you're on Orange Silence Radio.
8282494	8282834	Who's this?
8284975	8285395	Yo.
8286176	8286596	Yo.
8286837	8287537	Yo.
8288398	8288778	What up?
8288798	8289779	Hello there, OLR.
8289799	8293823	Speaking of which, speaking of a Swede, this is that one Swede.
8295184	8298206	It's our crazy Swede, Akin Ripper is calling in.
8298246	8299227	Jesus heck is this?
8300708	8301469	Shut up, Dan.
8301489	8303010	He's one of our official Swedes.
8303030	8305452	Dan, we have listeners all over the world.
8305552	8306533	Oh, this is real.
8306833	8306974	Yes.
8309174	8310975	I thought that guy was just putting on a voice.
8311075	8313436	No, he's really, well, at least as far as we know, he's really Swedish.
8313476	8314656	I'm pretty impressed now, actually.
8314816	8317237	No, no, no, no, Dan, I am from Sweden.
8317477	8319357	Can we show an Apple film?
8319837	8324099	Oh, well, that's a really bad example, but well.
8324539	8326359	He just went off on you in Swedish.
8326479	8327459	How is the chef?
8327600	8327980	That was hot.
8329800	8331282	I have a question about Sweden.
8331342	8332022	I want to know.
8333163	8334044	I have to know this.
8334204	8338889	Okay, so in Sweden, do you guys call Swedish fish just fish?
8340490	8341911	No, we don't.
8341931	8343873	They're delicious and they're rad.
8343953	8344754	We don't fish.
8346541	8349743	Well, some of us do, but it's like dying out of sorts.
8349763	8350544	He said some of us do.
8350704	8351184	Thank you.
8351925	8354046	I'm glad that you confirmed that for me.
8354586	8367876	But on the subject of fish, though, yes, I will, because I live in that part of Sweden where, you know, the thing where rotten fish is supposedly popular.
8368176	8370058	Oh, wait, but it isn't rotten.
8370158	8373160	It's just like fermented beyond fermented.
8373900	8374221	Right.
8374521	8374641	And...
8375712	8378754	Yeah, so-called Sooster means it.
8378774	8381195	So do you guys like eat them or do you just smell them?
8381235	8382195	I'm taking one of those.
8384777	8386958	Anyway, what did you call in for tonight?
8386978	8387538	What's the point?
8388279	8389799	Dan, stop egging him on.
8389900	8392981	Dan, Aki Ripper, what did you call in to talk about tonight?
8393001	8396383	That's what I said.
8396443	8403987	Well, Blizzard still won't accept won't let me play StarCraft 2, but oh well,
8404914	8406174	But here's the thing, though.
8406234	8413996	I haven't, like, I've tried to call their customer service for, well, what, two times?
8414136	8415236	And it was all busy.
8415316	8418337	And I'm like, yeah, screw this.
8418577	8420917	I'm going to start playing Sims 3.
8421257	8423178	Can you play StarCraft 1?
8423358	8427438	And speaking of Sims 3, there has been, like, a few...
8432090	8443248	Well, in a recent tweet thing about the coming expansion since late night, or what is it now?
8443869	8444049	Yeah.
8444662	8448464	Sims 3 Late Night, the latest expansion or whatever.
8448885	8451086	Is this with erotic roleplay as well?
8451806	8452647	Sims Late Night?
8452687	8453688	Sounds kind of kinky.
8453708	8455369	Isn't that why they killed Sims Online?
8455409	8459671	Yeah, Sims Online turned into just, it was so sinful.
8459831	8460612	What was going on?
8460852	8461392	Exactly.
8461412	8462073	Sims Online.
8462133	8464174	That's what the Sims always turns into.
8464454	8465835	Everyone who plays the Sims is a pervo.
8469097	8470558	Dan, shut up.
8471078	8471478	I play Sims.
8471498	8471879	Hold on, hold on.
8471979	8472419	I can't remember.
8472439	8472979	I can't remember.
8473199	8477021	I want to rewind a little bit because you're still mad at Blizzard and rightfully so.
8477301	8480383	But I have some ideas for you on how to take your revenge on Blizzard.
8480723	8486646	And one of them you just brought up, this stanky rotten fish thing, you need to send Blizzard a can of that.
8488367	8490448	So is it like you can't play any Blizzard games?
8490488	8492228	Can you play StarCraft 1, for example?
8492248	8493969	I don't think it will help in any kind of way.
8493989	8494169	And well...
8496471	8512409	One kind of thing that pisses me a bit off is that while I have apparently some way on getting that authenticator, my current cell phone that I use don't support the authenticator, unfortunately.
8513450	8515212	Can you get the little physical one?
8515232	8515833	Which sucks.
8516448	8517509	What time is it in Sweden?
8518149	8523593	You talked about the Blizzard Authenticator.
8523653	8525995	Yeah, the actual one, not the mobile one.
8526335	8529598	Which is available to some cell phones.
8530154	8539576	My problem is that the current cell phone that I'm using at the moment, I can't use that because it's not a Symbian cell phone.
8540376	8541657	I can remember.
8541697	8545397	They sell a standalone one that's not just for cell phones.
8545697	8546518	You push a little button on it.
8546778	8549298	Alan has one, and I used to have one a couple years ago.
8549598	8550759	It's like a physical authenticator.
8550779	8551999	You don't need a mobile phone for it.
8552079	8556320	Yeah, which is good because I will most likely order that one instead of the...
8557270	8558571	instead of the one on the cell phone.
8558671	8560492	All right.
8560812	8562733	Ike Ripper, we've got to let you go to get more calls.
8562833	8564554	Everybody was trying to get through to talk to Dan tonight.
8564854	8565735	But thank you very much.
8566535	8567016	Take care.
8567176	8568416	Anyway, once again, for all.
8569784	8572466	Your show rocks!
8573067	8574328	I love you, AK Ripper.
8574368	8575529	By the way, one other suggestion.
8575549	8576830	Especially actually tonight.
8577330	8582415	Tonight since actually Dan and, well, Nifty and all those guests was quite fun.
8582615	8587079	If you want to make Blizzard really upset, threaten to take away IKEA.
8590221	8593224	Swedish people would.
8593504	8594765	AK Ripper, you take care, buddy.
8595145	8596747	Good luck with your Blizzard drama.
8597087	8597407	Later.
8597607	8597868	Bye.
8598608	8599048	Well, this is...
8621567	8627473	DJ Blazeken I'm doing fine and actually kind of excited about the 3DS but not as much as if
8644329	8648553	There were Beatmania or DJ Max coming to the PS3.
8648793	8649454	Wait, hold on.
8649634	8651096	I got a real quick question for you.
8651116	8651756	Where are you from?
8653798	8656020	I'm straight out of Omaha, Nebraska.
8656141	8657021	Stuck here in the...
8658497	8662439	Middle of the United States of America with the best music arcade in America.
8662459	8663119	Okay, wait, hold on.
8663139	8664120	Hold that thought for a minute.
8664160	8666161	Dan, he's from Omaha, Nebraska.
8666181	8667141	That's not Sweden.
8667161	8667982	That's not Sweden.
8668002	8669842	I don't even think they have Ikea in Nebraska.
8669862	8671023	Nebraska, almost worse.
8671163	8671443	All right.
8671543	8672003	Shush.
8672284	8672884	Almost worse.
8672944	8674545	I haven't been to Nebraska yet.
8674585	8677926	Keep in mind, I'm going to be smacking him like a red-headed stepchild later.
8678286	8678566	All right.
8678767	8679187	Can I help?
8679487	8680227	The 3DS.
8680267	8684089	Now, you do know there is DJ Hero on the 3DS, but I don't know if you're a fan of that.
8686155	8686915	Actually, do you know what?
8687035	8701900	I made a sketch about a few months ago while sitting in lunch at high school and trying to figure out, because I kind of rumored how Guitar Hero came to the DS, so I was kind of figuring out how the heck they're going to pull off DJ Hero on DS.
8702641	8715665	And my thing was the same thing that they did for Guitar Hero, but just put a miniature turntable into the GBA slot with the buttons on there and then have the crossfader
8716636	8717597	on the touch screen.
8717918	8719219	That was my idea.
8735800	8736161	Jesus.
8736181	8736661	Only balls?
8736681	8739964	Yeah, especially for steering, unless you're using the little analog nubs they got on there.
8760501	8762123	That's how I play on the PSP.
8762203	8766327	I cannot stand... Well, they have an analog nut on it.
8766887	8768009	The collision was so weird.
8768029	8771732	When you run into your wall, the car would rotate like 15 degrees at a time.
8771832	8773114	It wasn't very smooth.
8773694	8774715	It is rich, right, sir.
8774815	8775016	I know.
8775056	8775456	Anyway, wait.
8775676	8777618	Hold on, because this is the real question I wanted to ask.
8777638	8782343	DJ Blaziken said he was drawing this out while he was in high school, kind of like doodling, it sounds like.
8782363	8782843	Okay.
8783584	8784064	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8802307	8804229	and a vine and like, you know, things.
8804869	8806371	And you would like on another piece of paper.
8806391	8812416	It was basically a poor man's Dungeons and Dragons mixed with an 8-bit video game.
8812616	8817120	We made many, many poor graph paper.
8817260	8818481	Yes, graph paper.
8818561	8820623	Exactly.
8820703	8824566	And there would always be a woman with big boobies at the end of the maze that we were trying to get to.
8824586	8824666	Yeah.
8828160	8830301	I don't know why I decided to talk about that, but I did.
8830581	8833382	Alright, I wanted to do a back in my day story.
8833582	8834082	Yes, anyways.
8835503	8857491	Okay, you know how the new DJ Max technical, which I haven't played yet, but I've been the only thing near to that we even have here in Omaha is DJ or not DJ Max Beatmania 13 Distorted is what we got over here, and I'll tell you this straight up, the
8858004	8860185	Family Fun Center is what it's called over here.
8860225	8863887	They've kept a majority of their music games up and running like perfect health.
8864827	8879193	Now, I've got to give a giant F you to my local mall's arcade because one of my favorite games down there, a music game in particular, In the Groove, which I play frequently when I go there while my mom's getting her nails done and whatnot.
8880534	8881634	That is one way to kill time.
8881654	8883815	Basically, it's down.
8884936	8885036	And
8886152	8888656	The game's been out of commission for more than a month.
8891582	8895509	Do you ever go to the nail salon and inhale the fumes in there before you go play in the groove?
8897042	8897542	BlackWolf
8927346	8929747	It's not the only one that has a vision problem.
8929887	8933727	I'm kind of also at the same point because I can only see well in one eye.
8933888	8937708	Well, I can think of two listeners we have at least that have both eyes blind.
8937728	8941529	Didn't In The Groove get sued out of existence?
8942750	8943370	Yeah, it got sued.
8943410	8946490	It got annihilated by judgments, basically.
8946771	8948551	It was sued out of commission.
8949993	8950834	but that's a whole other show
8978740	8981943	We're going to let you go, dude, because we've got to get more calls.
8982143	8984665	I've got one last question.
8984786	8985206	Make it quick.
8986027	8989870	Do you think there's a possibility of DJ Max Technica on the DS?
8990691	8991592	I wouldn't hold my breath.
8993490	8994691	Anything is possible.
8995251	8998233	It's always about sales and how much those dev kits are going to cost.
8998393	9002676	I wouldn't expect it for at least a year because those dev kits are going to have to come down in price a little bit.
9002796	9004097	So don't get your hopes up for right away.
9004617	9006999	All you got for right now is DJ Hero.
9007039	9010261	And if you're lucky, somebody will come up with another innovative music game.
9010301	9016706	Let's not forget the DS is what gave us Elite Beat Agents, which basically is DJ Max Technica.
9016966	9018187	I mean, right?
9019327	9021669	Well, again, I've never played Technica.
9021969	9037333	In the States and is now on sale with accessories for $9.99 Alright buddy, we're going to let you go to get more calls You take care, have a good one Alright, peace out, the show rocks, and bye Bye Okay, let's go to another call Hello, you're on Orange Lines Radio, who's this?

9071133	9072394	Everybody's been on this but me.
9072414	9073695	No, Rob, I got to level 20.
9073995	9076057	Why do I miss all the hot erotic chat?
9076949	9077830	Oh, don't worry, Dan.
9077870	9079672	If you like it, I'll send you the transcripts.
9079692	9080994	Dan, you are unemployed.
9081114	9082576	Now is the perfect time to play WoW.
9082696	9085139	Exactly.
9085159	9086501	You're like the fourth person to do that.
9086801	9087762	Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.
9087842	9088023	What?
9088503	9090566	Dan lives with me, so he's going to be playing Star Trek Online.
9091247	9091447	Oh, shit.
9092774	9095517	Lock yourself in your room and get a laptop.
9095717	9096898	See this wallpaper?
9097979	9098660	Deep Space Nine.
9099041	9099321	I know.
9099581	9100382	Star Trek Online.
9101023	9101443	It's okay.
9101763	9102764	You know what's terrible?
9102804	9104887	When I was a teenager, I was a Trekkie.
9105367	9106368	I mean hardcore.
9106869	9110593	The posters, the movies, you know, knowing Klingon, the whole works.
9111033	9112074	It was a show.
9112515	9112715	Huh?
9113553	9114854	It was the show on television.
9114894	9115154	Yeah.
9115454	9120617	Well, now my wife, ten years too late, has decided that she's going to be a Trekkie.
9120997	9121697	No, no, no, no.
9121717	9124779	That would have worked out for me, you know, years ago.
9124979	9126520	Now it's just like, really?
9126880	9127441	Star Trek?
9127641	9128261	That's cute.
9128561	9129241	No, no, no, no.
9129281	9131323	Although, admittedly, I do kind of want some con cologne.
9131343	9133304	Did you take her to the tour that's at Mather?
9133324	9134224	No, we stopped to go.
9134324	9135145	I do want to go to Mather.
9135185	9135705	Keep in mind.
9135745	9136325	Keep in mind.
9136866	9137926	OLR day at Mather.
9138126	9140247	Keep in mind, I missed Deep Space Nine when it was on TV.
9140267	9140648	We can double date.
9141628	9141968	DarkSakura.com
9163141	9166202	Star Trek Online, though, admittedly looks like a pretty neat game.
9166362	9167742	Okay, back to the caller.
9167802	9168442	Hi, caller.
9169063	9169383	Hi.
9169583	9173304	Anyway, so about those erotic chats, huh?
9175444	9176304	Yep, he does.
9176604	9178445	What did you call in to ask us about tonight?
9178465	9180906	He just wanted to remind you that you erotically chat, Rob.
9181166	9181666	Oh, sorry.
9182146	9184947	You just wanted to bring up those late night chats live on air.
9184987	9185507	I see how it is.
9185527	9185847	That's fine.
9186987	9188587	Let me read some of these transcripts.
9189008	9190148	Seriously, let the man talk.
9190188	9190448	What's up?
9193746	9197367	No, I wanted to talk about the... Now I can't even think.
9197407	9199388	Now I got all derailed by the whole chat thing.
9199668	9201668	Yeah, welcome to my life tonight.
9201688	9202749	Welcome to OLR.
9203509	9206150	Jamie was like, hey, Dan should host the show while Loki's gone.
9206170	9208071	I'm like, oh, sure, that sounds like a great idea.
9209531	9210791	I think Dan's going to be great.
9210872	9211692	Oh, no, Dan's been fun.
9211732	9212212	Dan's fun.
9212392	9212992	Guess what?
9213232	9213452	What?
9213632	9214893	You get the hell out of my house.
9216660	9218781	You can host from your new car.
9220602	9220902	I don't know.
9220962	9222542	I think Rob could take it in.
9223062	9223843	Yeah.
9223883	9224703	Dream on.
9225583	9226504	I didn't say how.
9226644	9227764	I just said I think you could.
9228124	9230365	Look, I don't even want to go into that conversation.
9230465	9230765	All right.
9231225	9231665	X-Link, hi.
9231685	9232666	This is getting inappropriate.
9232686	9233966	Where every gamer has a voice.
9233986	9236427	So anyways, how about those erotic chats?
9238868	9240288	What about it?
9241349	9244270	I believe you were going to ask something else until you were rudely derailed.
9245368	9246669	Um, no.
9247029	9248090	No, I can't think of what it is now.
9248810	9250431	So, I'm just going to leave it at that.
9250692	9252473	Alright, well have a great week, X-Link!
9252733	9253834	Erotic chats!
9254014	9255555	Thanks for the call, I think.
9256615	9257236	Have a good one.
9257336	9258196	It was good to talk to you.
9258236	9258637	You too.
9261398	9261939	I enjoyed that.
9261959	9262799	He sounded like a good guy.
9266874	9267594	I hate this show.
9267754	9268074	All right.
9268094	9269635	You're loving it.
9269915	9271195	I do love this show.
9271236	9272636	You've got a big smile on your face.
9272816	9273036	I do.
9273076	9273576	This is fun.
9274116	9275177	All right.
9275197	9277077	1-877-GAME-OLR.
9277098	9277938	Use the name on Skype.
9278138	9279358	It's orange.
9279498	9280159	Now, here's the thing, though.
9280179	9284740	When Loki comes back, you guys, you have to say, oh, the show sucked when you weren't there.
9284880	9290102	It just wasn't working without you there because I don't want him to feel bad.
9291488	9292269	You know what's weird though?
9292530	9294933	He's probably listening to us.
9294973	9297637	The show is always better when one of us is missing.
9297737	9306390	Like, you know Jamie missed episode 69, which was that epic night that Loki sang the karaoke revolution and is like one of our greatest moments ever.
9306410	9307712	He's saying, I'm staying in.
9307992	9309054	and I was gone.
9309074	9314381	I was gone one night and this show just totally like, I don't even know what happened.
9314642	9320130	They were watching a Ron Jeremy biography live on air and commenting on it.
9320150	9322914	You wait until 378 when we pay all our Mad Libs.
9324520	9325942	Wait, which episode was that?
9326242	9327264	It will be epic.
9327284	9328405	All right, can we take another call, please?
9328506	9328706	All right.
9329207	9330689	Hi, who said no?
9331470	9331950	Misty?
9332151	9333232	Misty's the new director.
9333633	9335275	Vito, take the call.
9335315	9335976	All right, I'm hanging up.
9336016	9336497	No, I'm kidding.
9336837	9337919	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9337939	9338279	Who's this?
9339707	9343469	Hi, this is your family neighborhood Rick Roller Spazinator.
9343489	9344770	Hi Spazinator, it didn't work.
9345050	9346391	I had the sound off, haha.
9346851	9347852	What's up?
9348552	9355856	Well, after a couple years of having that, I know I'm kind of late to the whole Rick Rolling thing, but I figured I'd do it at least once.
9357077	9364581	But at any rate, two little tidbits of information, probably one of which you may already know about.
9366093	9371216	but I can't figure you would like to know about since you're really big on the music based games.
9372817	9383322	From what I've heard through Gravevine, supposedly DDR is coming to both the 360 and PlayStation 3.
9385843	9392146	I don't really follow DDR at all, so I don't know
9393021	9409061	Which a version of DDR is coming to the systems, but since I know that you are into DDR, I kind of figured the fact that it's coming out to newer systems may pique your interest.
9409767	9411188	That's right, motherfucker!
9411208	9411428	Oh, bitch!
9411648	9411848	What?
9411888	9411968	What?
9439400	9440861	Who's Rick Wall and who now?
9442082	9446004	There's no stranger to love.
9446484	9448145	Yeah, that deserved a Pikachu beatdown.
9448265	9450026	Alright, I just got smacked with a Pikachu.
9450786	9452868	I've got shrivels on my screen, Rob.
9453948	9456970	When Rob gets smacked with a Pikachu, he usually means something else.
9457350	9458451	Where did you put Angus?
9459790	9461291	What the hell are you talking about?
9461331	9461911	My Tribble!
9462351	9463251	It was in the blue bucket.
9465132	9466853	Damn, don't tell me right away about another Tribble.
9466953	9467893	Angus is in the closet.
9467933	9468333	Hold on.
9469013	9476016	Spazinator actually had a question, and I may or may not want to answer it, about what DDR version.
9476256	9477076	Here's the thing, Spazinator.
9477136	9478317	Actually, this is my honest answer.
9478977	9484119	As far as these DDR games go, the new ones that are coming out, we don't know a lot about them, period.
9484159	9487420	That's what makes this press event that's happening this week so interesting is
9487760	9512490	is because we had all this information about the Xbox and PlayStation DDRs coming out and then suddenly there was nothing for a while but I think what happened is that at E3 then we saw Dance Masters come out and Dance Masters is a Xbox 360 game so that the PlayStation 3 users have something here is my guess and I honestly believe this is the honest to God truth the game that was going to come out on the 360 and PlayStation 3
9513130	9516912	Now canceled on the 360 in favor of Dance Masters.
9517332	9522694	But for those folks that don't have a 360, you get Dance Dance Revolution on the PlayStation 3.
9523334	9525035	I honestly kind of think that's where things went.
9526515	9531037	And it's really hard to say if this new PlayStation 3 game is going to be good or not until we know more about it.
9532118	9534939	From what we heard a couple years ago, it's like a greatest hits...
9535399	9563792	A lot of the famous songs and some new ones Lots of DLC, 8 panel dancing It certainly makes it sound like it's going to be leaps and bounds better than the 360 games that already exist Because there is Universe 1, 2, and 3 But I think the PlayStation 3 one, you know, it's the first DDR game I'm not even acknowledging the Wii ones because they're ridiculous But it's the first real DDR game we've had in a couple years And if they've actually rebuilt it from the ground up and so forth, it might be kind of cool That's my thought Yeah
9564727	9575511	Yeah, as someone that's never touched a music game, aside from some of the older Guitar Hero games and The Rock Band games, I'm willing to at least give it a try.
9576212	9585138	Spazinator, before you go buy DDR on the PlayStation 3, which will cost you at least $60, honestly, if you want to try it and see if you like it, you can find dance games on the PlayStation 1, because I don't think you have a 360.
9585198	9585658	Do you have a 360?
9585718	9585838	No.
9601238	9601718	Yeah, I do.
9601978	9602238	Oh, okay.
9602258	9602919	Well, then, never mind.
9603299	9607120	You can go buy a cheap dance pad for, like, no more than $20.
9607580	9612542	And you could probably... Like, DarkSakura found the fancy dance pads at a local... I bought three of them for $6.
9612702	9614203	Yeah, they're, like, super cheap.
9614483	9617004	So if you look at, like, discount stores and stuff, you might find them even cheaper.
9617064	9619524	But no more than $20 for a cheap game pad.
9619865	9626127	And, like, DDR Universe 2 at GameStop, I shit you not, I saw it in a bin the other day, $7 used.
9626547	9627807	So I would say for $27...
9629628	9654033	try it and if you think the game is fun and you're like hey I want like a more souped up version of this this is kind of fun this is getting me moving and burning calories then drop the 60 bucks on the PlayStation 3 but if you're not sure Spazinator don't don't spend more than 30 bucks doing the trial run because you'll still yeah I mean you're still getting a decent game out of it it's not that the 360 games are bad they're not they're just you know they're they're they're dated at this point
9655464	9657305	Yeah, I'll definitely look into it.
9657525	9666991	Granted, it's going to be a while before I buy even a used retail game, because money's kind of, you know, tight at the moment.
9667031	9673936	But before I do let you go, there's one more thing I just want to pass along.
9674056	9674436	Yes, sir.
9674476	9679579	I don't know if it's on the Xbox Marketplace just yet or not.
9679859	9681901	It's been a couple days since I checked it, but...
9682785	9701020	at least over on the game side of the PSN store there is I guess it amounts to a half hour long machinima movie that Rockstar Games had made using Red Dead Redemption.
9701340	9702181	Interesting.
9703021	9711228	Yeah, totally free download, will cost you cents and it clocks in and literally
9711818	9715579	Yeah, yeah, you know, based on the description I read on, uh,
9738502	9749611	and I think on the video itself towards the end, the half hour movie is supposed to serve as like a prequel to the actual game.
9750411	9750752	All right.
9751312	9754975	Well, Spaznator, we're going to let you go so we can take more calls or wrap the show up.
9754995	9757297	I don't know what we're going to do yet, but have a good one, buddy, okay?
9758348	9759648	Yep, you too, take care Later
9788109	9789030	It's a new regime here.
9789050	9791011	To be on the show.
9791031	9793914	1-877-GAME-OLR Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9795795	9796696	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9796716	9797077	Who's this?
9798037	9798818	Hey, it's Ranma.
9798918	9799499	Hold on, hold on.
9799539	9805884	Before we take your call, Ranma, Producer Misty, Producer Misty, is there anything you want to make Ranma do to see if we can take his call tonight or not?
9808634	9809955	I thought that it was him, so he's cool.
9810195	9811056	Take off your pants!
9811296	9811736	Yodel!
9812397	9815119	Eat my terrible cooking!
9815139	9816260	Your cooking isn't terrible.
9816880	9818301	Misty's our Nakane.
9818362	9819703	You have a lovely taco.
9820423	9827329	Mystique is our local fusion of Nabiki and Akane, so she's our Nakane.
9828937	9833538	You guys are starting to scare the living shit out of me right now.
9833618	9834038	That's alright.
9834358	9834638	Good!
9836258	9837879	Wait, you just tuned in, didn't you?
9838559	9840699	Yes, I just tuned in and got rip-rolled.
9840759	9841959	I'm like, what the hell?
9842100	9846500	I just want to say, this show, like, yeah.
9847921	9849541	This show has been awesome.
9850461	9852862	I've been doing backflips over the shark all evening.
9852882	9855062	It has much more Dan than any other show has ever had.
9856681	9877909	I'm on the road with DDR Darla Bill we're coming back from somewhere and I get a text from GL saying that her boobs got nicknames now I'm dealing with my phone trying to get the stream to work with no avail you're trying to get the stream to work stop it right now Ranma, I'm so sorry for Dan
9883411	9884411	He's met Dan before.
9887092	9888152	He slept at my house.
9888652	9891793	Dude, Dan just pitched Pikachu.
9891973	9895614	Can we ask what Ranma... Yes.
9895734	9897354	Can we ask Ranma why he called in tonight?
9897374	9899315	We all know Ranma.
9899555	9899975	Yes, Ranma.
9901115	9906816	I didn't have much to contribute except for the fact that DJ Hero bundles are now $40 at Best Buy.
9907717	9908097	Sweet.
9908317	9909417	Now they'll sell a million more.
9910479	9928491	I know, I went online earlier this morning and ordered mine and I went to check other places because it seems that Kmart was the first one to do and I was trying to get a price match but Best Buy has it but I find it funny that GameStop is selling their bundles for $49.99 online only and stores still $100 on related news to that
9929391	9932054	This is a great example of how failed the PS3 is.
9932895	9937479	At Fry's, the Super Deluxe Logitech Guitar Hero controllers.
9937539	9939121	They get the drum and the guitar.
9940182	9940823	50 bucks a piece.
9941103	9942084	Wow.
9942104	9942764	Are you serious?
9942965	9944746	Yes, because those are $200 controllers.
9945047	9948210	I'm looking at that and I'm like, if they have 361s, they're bought.
9948550	9949191	They are bought.
9949291	9950292	Find the 361s, they're still 200 bucks.
9950552	9950612	Ugh.
9952874	9959717	because honestly, not for nothing, I would drop $200 on the Logitech ones instead of buying the Mad Catz one because I don't care what anyone says.
9959997	9961197	Mad Catz controllers and etc.
9961217	9962038	is a piece of shit.
9963358	9963818	You don't say.
9964139	9966780	Frisbee in our chatroom says Toys R Us is at $40 as well.
9966800	9968961	Their Street Fighter sticks are pretty nice.
9970441	9976724	I will say though, guys, now, if you're at all interested in DJ Hero 2, now's the time to go get your controller.
9977024	9977404	Yeah.
9977964	9980945	And get practically a free DJ Hero 1 with it.
9981065	9981426	Yeah.
9981466	9981846	There you go.
9981886	9982286	Yeah.
9983991	9984691	Yeah.
9985052	9988254	Or if you're smart, you buy two bundles and you trade in one game.
9989435	9989975	I'm not smart.
9990675	9991376	I just went cross-eyed.
9992096	9992377	All right.
9993377	9994978	Ranma, thanks so much for your call, buddy.
9994998	9996379	Anything else you want to share quickly tonight?
9997920	9998420	No, that's it.
9999081	9999621	All right, bye.
9999901	10000202	Peace.
10000242	10001182	Bye.

10006906	10007687	I was hoping for him to call.
10007707	10008547	I'm looking at baby.
10008627	10010488	Apparently, he wasn't really listening most of the night.
10010729	10011009	I know.
10011029	10011769	He missed out.
10011989	10012270	All right.

10034045	10034986	We're wrapping up tonight's show.
10035026	10036287	Do we have any last minute stories?
10036367	10038729	Any last minute video game news stories you want to talk about?
10038869	10039349	Not really.
10039970	10040210	Dan?
10040530	10041391	I like video games.
10041471	10042051	I know, me too.
10042111	10042612	They're pretty cool.
10042652	10044733	But, you know, are we doing an afterbirth, Rob?
10044773	10046855	Because we really don't do cage match or anything.
10046875	10047816	We'll do a quick afterbirth.
10048136	10048396	Okay.
10048476	10048736	Alright.
10049197	10050217	It'll be more of a stillbirth.

10085368	10088249	So all the listeners that are upset there's no show next week, you need to blame Misty.
