14226	19572	Tonight, August 29th, 2010, could Sony soon adopt the controversial online pass?
19952	26700	Two retail chains jump in the used video game market, and an upcoming MMO plans to penalize players that play too much.
31823	39268	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio, the video game show where every gamer has a voice.
39688	48273	We do tape live every Sunday night at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
48713	57379	My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be joining over the next few hours with my awesome co-host, always here every week, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
57679	59379	I hope I'm always here, it's my house.
59879	63260	Well, there have been times where you haven't been here and those are the awkward shows.
63400	66781	The awkward shows where Dan's like, are they going to run off with the vault?
67901	71441	There's also been about six different studios in OLR's history.
72062	75542	We tend to bounce around like a homeless college kid.
75722	76702	This one's my favorite.
77182	79923	Yeah, because you just have to roll out of bed and into the studio.
80203	82323	This is my least favorite because I have to drive out here.
83083	83764	At least I like you.
84084	85644	I like your garage too.
86244	86664	It was nice.
86724	87545	Except it was hot.
116118	118219	Yep, so... You seem to be doing okay, though.
118259	134187	You seem to be awake enough, but if you not... Well, I can thank, you know, playing Final Fantasy XI for early hours in the morning, you know, to thank for that, since, you know, that kind of got me accustomed to, you know, being able to operate without that much sleep.
134667	136828	Well, if you nod off during the show, we'll know what's going on, right?
137711	138131	DarkSakura
167604	169446	Um, it was fairly old school.
169486	185059	I don't know if the pile of Master System games is still out in the front room, because I've gotten used to it out there, but Dan was playing some Alex Kidd and Shinobi World, and Zillion, a lot of Zillion, and we played a couple things together.
185319	185900	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
203360	205241	That only came out in Brazil.
205481	207942	And that was also after the Genesis version was out.
207962	210823	Because, you know, remember, Blast Processing was the secret to Sonic.
210883	211343	Remember that?
211863	218225	So there wasn't... Yeah, I mean, yeah, there was a Sonic on the Master System, but it was a little bit, you know, not... It was way after the fact.
218565	223267	So I sort of saw, back in the day, Alex Kidd as the Mario on Sega's system.
223327	224347	I mean, I don't know.
224527	226628	In my young mind, that's kind of what I saw.
227248	227769	Monopoly Monopoly
245845	246446	Oh, wow.
247126	251951	As in Monopoly, but they actually did M-O-N-O space capital P-O-L-Y.
251971	252472	Awesome.
252492	253453	So we have Monopoly.
253833	254514	Monopoly.
255695	256335	Nice.
256495	258297	But Dan didn't actually have the Master System.
258497	260740	He was using the Power Base Converter on the Genesis.
260920	262942	And then I played some Star Trek online today.
263582	265264	I made an Andorian chick just because.
266465	266625	And...
270475	284485	I was given a game on Steam and one of our listeners sent me something fantastic and I put it over here because I've been waiting for Dan to get off the old school kick so I could play Final Fantasy XIII.
284685	285025	Thank you.
286286	288988	Gave me Rival School's drama album.
289048	289889	Wait, from a listener?
290189	290549	Yeah.
290689	291070	Wow.
291910	294372	And it was addressed to Sakura Kasugano.
295633	296734	Do you know what listener sent that to you?
297758	305055	I'm trying to remember, I've got the box right here, but I didn't put the name on it, just his real name.
307529	308269	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
329122	330102	Thank you, Fred.
353532	357697	Siv4 I got from X-Link and I got the same Steam game you did.
357917	359880	Oh, that was... Okay.
360180	362684	Because, yeah, I've been meaning to try it out.
363585	364606	I started school last week.
365948	370474	So, of course, there goes... I play Peggle at Fuddruckers.
371584	372804	When they ruin my order!
373164	375845	Let me go into our chatroom at chat.orangelandstreetie.com.
376145	380886	Dark Kiske is in chat trying to take responsibility for sending it to you, but said JK.
381627	385868	Let's see, Dark Tetsuya says, I don't know what my favorite Sega Master System game is.
385968	389469	Toss up between the Ghostbusters port and Astro Warrior.
389789	395650	Was the Ghostbusters port on Sega Master System the same one that was on Commodore 64 and the computers back in the early 80s?
396030	397591	Or is that a different Ghostbusters game?
398231	399673	Are you the gatekeeper?
415327	417669	So this is the last semester of school for you, right?
417709	419310	You graduate away this year?
419330	421612	Well, not forever the last semester.
421732	424194	You've been in school since the show started.
424515	426196	Well, you know why, and I've got to say this.
426456	429158	There's nothing wrong with always wanting to enrich the mind.
429679	436464	I spent way too much time doing what everyone else said that I should do instead of doing what I love, and now I just said, fuck it, I'm doing what I love.
437505	443770	And I'm going to graduate with my AA, and I'm going to do a year of the rest of my gen ed for...
444751	447373	I'm actually kind of thinking of not going to Sac State, maybe going to UC Davis.
448514	451176	It'll be a drive, but I might get a better education out of it.
451397	454639	So you'd say the life lesson you learned is that you should go to school to study what you love?
455080	455300	Yeah.
455980	457582	Can I major in pornography in college?
458963	459223	Rob.
459563	459743	What?
460524	466649	My point is that when you find something that you can make a living out of that you love, go for it.
467009	469731	I also love food, but I can't cook.
470112	472173	So I don't know what to do.
472233	474736	You could actually take journalism classes and be a food critic.
476637	477658	Now that's a good idea.
478459	480721	Aren't all food critics fat?
481101	483223	Don't take offense if you're a food critic.
483263	484063	I've never known any.
484464	485705	You could have high metabolism.
486205	488207	But they're all pompous asses.
488887	492891	At least that's what I've gathered from watching the Food Network.
493691	497372	Actually, on Iron Chef America, Julie Chan is a food critic and she's my hero.
498332	502653	We should do a one-off side podcast that's called Fat Butt.
505714	507834	And talk about all the food we love that makes our butts fat.
507854	509414	That's what Alan calls me, actually.
509674	510815	Really?
511415	512675	I could be the host, Fat Butt.
512975	514635	He shouldn't call you Fat Butt.
514715	515456	I'm making that up.
515496	516876	He should call you Plump Booty.
517456	518396	I'm not going to get into it.
518476	519736	Actually, my nickname is Fat Kitty.
520397	522377	I'm not going to get into that.
524514	529083	I'm gonna get a text message in 5, 4, 3, STOP TALKING!
531187	534994	Alright, anyhow, if that's it for DarkSakura's Gaming Week, Loki, how was your Gaming Week?
535841	536862	It was okay.
536942	547928	Didn't really play a lot except for on Friday where we did this kind of company sales team building thing where we went to Dave & Buster's and played some games.
549249	557914	The whole team building portion of that event was kind of dumb because they have this arcade full of wonderful games and they put you on all the old...
558274	559456	All the really crappy games.
559556	563400	Except for, say, Rallying Classic, which is better known as Daytona.
564001	565422	Sans License, you know.
567024	567625	And that was fun.
568005	572791	But the person that was kind of... They had us split up into groups of four, so we were all teams of four.
573531	579352	And the guy that was in charge of our three teams of four was an idiot.
579512	587654	And instead of putting three people up each round to have them go head-to-head against each team, they just had each team compete against themselves.
587974	595335	And because of that and his horrible scorekeeping, we ended up near last place because he was a complete idiot.
595435	597976	Not that it matters because it was just for fun, but whatever.
598316	599136	It's still a waste of time.
599876	602537	I did, though, play some arcade games.
602557	605098	I got to play the Rambo shooting game, which is kind of funny.
606359	608420	But, I mean, it's just kind of... They have that at Golf Land, too.
608440	609600	Did you play the Terminator one?
609620	610781	Because that one's actually really fun.
610881	613942	No, I did walk past it a bunch of times, and that looked really cool.
613982	614582	And it's hard.
615322	616943	But I just didn't get a chance to do that.
617183	618404	There are so many pretty games there.
618504	622945	But I actually played some DDR, played DDRX, and I...
625384	626485	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
647822	651843	How that works is beyond me, but that's what happens.
651863	653404	So I played some doubles on that.
653464	656685	I don't really care for the new stage that they have.
656745	664727	It looks really cheap because it's all one single sheet of metal that they have in there instead of all the little panels, which are really cool looking.
665427	666348	But, yeah, whatever.
666408	668188	And the spacing's a little different.
669469	670689	But that's minor.
671629	671729	Um...
673590	674670	Let's see, what else?
675871	678692	I played a game called Tank, Tank, Tank, which is kind of fun.
679152	680713	Which mission did you do?
681573	682834	Did you do the giant monster mission?
684594	686975	Well, we just played Versus, so... Oh, no.
687095	691577	Next time you play that, you have to do co-op and play against the giant bees.
692537	693338	And the giant squid.
693938	694798	And then the building mecha.
694838	695899	Oh, you were telling me about this game.
696159	697479	This game is so much fun!
697499	698980	It's Tank versus Bees.
699740	727462	that's strange you can either choose versus or you know two tanks versus two other tanks or you can go against the evil robot hordes and so you get like these big missiles with grinny faces on them they're so fantastic I don't know bees are pretty fucking terrible I call them mecha bees but yeah tank tank tank was pretty fun and there was some other game that we played it was kind of like track mania the arcade game almost and that was alright what else did I play there
729964	730745	That was about it.
730825	732206	I just played a lot of DDR.
733227	735509	I'm not very in shape anymore.
737411	746078	It's been a while since I played DDR, but I actually did play A on doubles on, I guess it's called Expert now, which is like an 11-footer.
747539	762667	and I passed it but oh my god I felt like crap afterwards of course now that I think of it I don't think there's ever been a time they played a and doubles on heavy or whatever that actually didn't feel like crap afterwards so that's fine did you go right into playing a hard song
764135	765156	Well, no, that was my last song.
765236	770019	I actually played... Still, just in one game, you played, you know, wow.
770119	772161	You ever heard of a warm-up?
772861	774562	I did play warm-up stuff.
774903	779666	It was really tiring me out, though, because I'm not used to it anymore.
779766	788252	So I was playing, you know, some of the new songs that were in there were kind of dumb, so I didn't really care for the new DDRX songs, I guess.
790253	818392	I played a few actually a few times I played Hysteria because I liked one of the patterns for I guess it was the I don't even know what they call it now the second setting it would have been trick I don't remember they change them all just to change them it's just annoying whatever red difficulty right yes the medium difficulty I like the double pattern for that so that was fun and then I was trying to remember like I remember there was
820134	833233	you know 20 November I know if you play that on I think heavy and little that like makes no notes for like quite a while that would have been fun also there's another one that was like that
834722	851034	Anyway, so, played a few rounds of that, and that was fun, um, and then, of course, you know, Redemption stuff, played some Deal or No Deal, because, I mean, that game was super easy, um, but yeah, so now, it was funny, because I had a bunch of Dave and Buster power cards from, like,
851594	857998	Back when we went to our first E3, like when we went to Irvine, you know, and went to that Dave & Buster's, I had a card from that.
858018	860279	Wow, that was a long time ago.
860420	869685	I had one from when we went to Milpitas one time, and so I combined that together with one that they gave us to use during this competition.
870025	875749	Then I got another one from them later on, so I have like a bunch of credits at Dave & Buster's right now.
875769	877730	I just haven't gotten a chance to use them.
878070	906256	but it's not bad it's a small one compared to the other ones and they even said though like because the people are reps at Dave and Buster's they said it's one of the I think it's the smallest one that they have which is kind of lame but whatever it's nice to at least have one they should put another one in Folsom though I definitely agree that because there's nothing in Folsom and it's kind of weird that they put Dave and Buster's like right next to Golf Land and right down the street from you know John's Incredible Pizza you know all these different like fun land places it's weird they're right there
906636	910279	And then, of course, other than that, Grand Theft Auto Lost and Damned.
910299	911480	I've been playing a lot more of that.
911941	912781	And that's still fun.
912801	914002	I'm working on mod stuff.
914343	921349	It's kind of annoying, though, because I'm sure not a lot of people are familiar with the Grand Theft Auto console modding community.
921729	924711	But they're very, I don't know, very...
927591	929012	I don't know what the word would be for it.
929032	931333	They're dicks, I guess.
931833	935835	It's because they figure out something and they kind of hold it above everybody's head.
936315	941418	Well, I figured out something, so I posted about it because, you know, it's kind of cool.
941458	942498	I thought I'd share something.
943039	950683	And so now they're saying, oh, well, we did the same thing and we're not going to tell you guys how to do it until a while from now.
950703	952704	So I posted in that same thread how to do it.
953124	954344	And they went and deleted my post.
954665	955765	I'm like, you motherfuckers.
956085	957346	So I got to release something.
957586	958327	Wait, what is this?
959087	961949	It's modding the game.
963290	969955	I figured out how to change the maps, and actually I figured out how to change where different cars spawn and stuff like that.
969975	971196	Make your own website.
971376	973598	Well, I don't even give a crap.
973618	974799	Okay, all you do...
976380	977981	Post an Orange Lounge Radio story.
978021	978621	It's really easy.
978661	980162	I'll send you the PDF that Dekeman made.
980503	982664	You post a news story to OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
982724	983724	Title of story.
983945	984965	What's the name of this website?
985585	986266	Seven Sins.
986646	987787	Fuck Seven Sins.
988007	991629	And then post your hacks and all that stuff.
991829	993230	It's like high school drama.
993290	994331	It's so pathetic.
995131	997213	It is a bunch of high schoolers, I hate to break it to ya
1016061	1020222	No, I already have a YouTube video out there of it, and so I'm all set.
1020342	1023863	I've got my bases covered, but it's just that, you know, these guys... Dibs.
1024343	1025183	Loki has dibs.
1025303	1035525	It's just, like, they sent me a private message that says, don't worry, we'll give you, you know, we're crediting you for indirectly coming up with this idea.
1035545	1036545	I'm like, indirectly?
1036825	1039266	I directly came up with this fucking idea, stupid.
1040746	1041527	I don't mean to be rude but...
1058541	1061783	I just have problems people taking credit for something I came up with.
1062263	1072567	The whole point was I was just trying to give them an idea because all the stuff that they have out there right now, hacks, is just people editing the lines for the handling of the cars and stuff like that.
1072587	1073827	So, oh, look, this car's fast.
1073887	1076388	Oh, look, this car crashes through things.
1076488	1077508	Oh, this one flies.
1077648	1078709	Big fucking whoop.
1079449	1083433	Alright, I gotta take a sidetrack here to read some of the chat comments because they've been accumulating here.
1083933	1086556	SpazinatorPSN is talking about that Tank Tank Tank game.
1086576	1092001	It says, when you beat Tank Tank Tank and watch the credits, it says, tanks for playing!
1093021	1093281	Yep.
1093561	1093942	Get it?
1094602	1094982	Haha.
1096023	1101206	See, remember earlier I was talking about food and porn and all that and what we should major in in school?
1101807	1105970	SatelliteMinded in chat says, Rob should combine food and porn and make a living from that.
1106390	1112354	And Ranma follows that up with a website called www.foodporndaily.com, which I'd never heard of, but...
1113129	1115430	Yum, all you do is you click on pictures of food.
1115510	1119452	Like this one is mac and cheese with bacon and chicken.
1120092	1121032	Then I click it again.
1122053	1124273	Mmm, pork chops with parsley.
1124894	1125434	Yum.
1126374	1128275	And it's just food porn.
1129455	1130876	Mmm, salmon sliders.
1131156	1132517	What about this is why you're fat?
1133677	1137839	A lot of that stuff makes me ew, but this is like classy porn.
1138319	1138419	Yeah.
1139940	1148783	This is more like... It's the difference between an escort and a 20-buck prostitute.
1149263	1150743	This is like Cinemax.
1151604	1154005	Right here, the food porn daily is like Cinemax.
1154385	1156305	And this is why your fat.com is like Hustler.
1156566	1158726	That's basically the difference between the two.
1159387	1159747	There you go.
1160687	1161247	All right, anyhow.
1161307	1162728	Anything else for your gaming week, Loki?
1162868	1163088	Sorry.
1163764	1164545	No, that's really it.
1164885	1168406	I'm just glad, though, my dev kit's coming next week.
1168606	1173249	I'm excited to see how that kind of works out for you.
1173529	1175550	Curious how that plays or whatever.
1175570	1175910	We'll see.
1176210	1176450	All right.
1177150	1178091	Let's see my gaming week.
1178731	1180212	I've been playing... Oh, real quick.
1180312	1180812	Oh, fine.
1181132	1181872	Not my gaming week.
1182473	1183733	It's just a story, real quick.
1183873	1184674	This is funny.
1184854	1185214	Yes.
1186014	1191677	I experienced on my way over to the show today what I would consider white trash karaoke.
1193380	1194500	Thanks for watching!
1211525	1214909	Please tell me she's singing like, you know, Kesha or something.
1215349	1217912	Wake up in the morning feeling like we did it.
1218072	1222317	It's like some country western song or something, but it was awful.
1222457	1224279	I'm like, why would you blast that?
1225540	1231927	Seriously, I thought they were having like a party or something, but no, it's just this one chick apparently wanting to annoy the neighbors.
1231947	1232747	She wants to be famous.
1234029	1234429	Let's see.
1234689	1236190	Well, I actually will start off.
1236270	1241154	I have a completely, like, doesn't have anything to do with gaming story, but I had a very strange weekend, okay?
1242115	1245617	I was actually supposed to be going to LA this weekend, but I didn't end up going.
1246378	1252902	And part of the reason why I didn't end up going is that I was scheduled to take a flight on JetBlue from Sacramento to Long Beach.
1253203	1256965	Because that's, you know, probably one of the easiest ways to get to LA, and JetBlue is a fine airline.
1256985	1258887	You can watch TV in the back seats and everything.
1259868	1281449	So we get to the airport, we're sitting there waiting for our flight to go, and suddenly they come on the intercom and say, well, your plane had to evacuate, there was an emergency, the brakes caught fire, and sure enough, we're looking out the window and there's this plane sitting there on the runway and the slides are all inflated and all these people are standing out kind of looking.
1282330	1301446	and yeah if you heard about that because it was kind of a big deal it was on like CNN and stuff yeah I was supposed to be on that plane so I was sitting there in the terminal while that plane was landing waiting to board it so yeah that was kind of a day ruiner we tried to catch another flight that was seven hours later in Oakland but we were like okay well at least we'll still get to go to LA at some point
1302387	1323662	and then uh yeah that flight ended up getting delayed for about three and a half hours because the whole system was backed up and that's about the point where we said fuck it because a we could have just driven there faster b we were going to lose our rental car and all this other stuff and it was kind of annoying so uh kind of a bummer but yeah just a completely random story because you know it's it's not every day that you're sitting right in front of national news unfolding before your eyes
1323922	1324423	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1341081	1341662	That's pretty cool.
1341702	1343983	How much did they pair?
1345825	1343983	$75.
1346145	1355573	She was thinking she probably could have got more, but at the same time, at a moment like that, you're not thinking, oh, I want to take a picture so I can sell it.
1356433	1359216	I think it was more of a novelty thing.
1359256	1361858	How many people can say they've sold a picture to the Associated Press?
1362558	1364200	That's not an everyday occurrence.
1366081	1369684	I think she did it more for the novelty of it than for the actual money, and I can't say I blame her.
1369704	1370585	I would have done the same thing.
1370925	1377749	I took pictures too on Twitter, it's just that iPhone pictures don't have nearly the detail that she actually took them on a real camera.
1377789	1380811	That's why they wanted her pictures, because not a lot of people had that.
1380911	1383353	So, yeah, kind of a weird weekend.
1383813	1385654	So, let's see.
1386154	1391438	Monty Boggs in our chatroom says, stuff like that happens in airlines, bitch, about how not enough people are flying.
1391858	1392438	You know what, though?
1393139	1399002	Not to get too far off the topic of games, except that I was supposed to be playing a bunch of them this weekend and didn't get to because of this.
1399642	1399723	Um...
1400743	1428613	Monty Boggs the thing is though that every time something like this happens like okay the SAC airport is not that big of an airport but this was I'm sure on the news wherever it is you live I know this was on the news in like Connecticut it was on CNN it was on MSNBC nobody died nobody was severely hurt like a few people were taken to the hospital but it's because a lot of whiplash type conditions because of the breaking of the plane and apparently people got rug burns from sliding down those inflatable slides
1429153	1454175	and those were the injuries that people had so it's unfortunate and it sucks but I've seen car accidents that were tons worse and you don't hear about every single car accident so I still think flying is pretty safe all things considered I'm glad the brakes decided to go when they did and not an hour later because I would prefer to just have stayed at home all weekend and not be in the hospital in Long Beach being treated for burns because I had to take a trip down the slide
1455556	1458737	However, if I did have to go down the slide, I'd at least grab a beer first like that guy did.
1459777	1461358	Beer is great.
1462078	1463378	Let me talk about actual games.
1463918	1467859	I had to talk about that because national news being right in front of me doesn't happen every day.
1469580	1469900	Games.
1470060	1472701	I've been playing Warcraft, of course, still working on my characters.
1472741	1477042	We're about halfway through Icecrown Citadel, which is cool, and the whole guild's gearing up, and it's cool.
1477342	1479562	But Cataclysm really needs to be out now.
1479842	1480963	I'm ready for it.
1481043	1481583	I think we all are.
1482424	1483465	I've been playing more Starcraft 2.
1483965	1490371	I've been just trying to go after some of the achievements a little bit and just playing the campaign a little bit here and there.
1490391	1497098	I'm progressing very slowly through that game, but considering I didn't even want to play it at first, I'm surprisingly having a really good time with that.
1497618	1499479	I do have a couple new games I want to talk about this week.
1499539	1503680	First off, out on PlayStation Network this week was an adaptation of Press Your Luck.
1504640	1508581	This game has already come out on the PC and the Wii, and I think there's an iPhone version as well.
1508901	1514142	But it came out on PlayStation Network this week, and it was really the first chance I had to check it out.
1514222	1518623	I have the DVD game from a few years ago, which I believe Jamie actually gave me as a gift a couple years ago.
1519304	1519864	I have that.
1519944	1524465	That's really the only version of the game I have to compare it to, which you can't compare a video game to a DVD game.
1524585	1524805	Sorry.
1525785	1544711	I never really played the Wii game I've only heard about it and I've only really heard about the PC game as well so I haven't really played them the PlayStation 1 it's okay like there's some really cool things and then there's some really not so cool things that really detract from it
1545151	1546432	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1562406	1565928	and then when you're actually playing the board sequences, it's a lot of fun.
1566148	1570029	Like, you know, your character's actually going, big bucks, big bucks, no whammies.
1570069	1574831	You know, they're actually saying it and the whammy animations are actually really well done.
1574891	1576432	That's actually probably the best thing about the adaptation.
1576452	1577312	I saw some on the trailer.
1577492	1580033	Yeah, the whammy, there's new stuff.
1580454	1583035	You know how there would always be pop culture tie-ins?
1583135	1589737	I always remember the little whammy that was like Boy George that would sing, do you really want a whammy?
1592785	1595429	I don't know why I remember this stuff from when I was like seven, okay?
1596069	1600475	But now they have like an American Idol whammy and some of these other like pop culture references and that's really cute.
1600495	1600876	That's cool.
1601757	1606784	But unfortunately, with these really high points, there's also a lot of like clunk.
1609266	1611328	The interface feels very clunky.
1611868	1618334	The shell around the game itself feels very rushed and just not flashy at all like a game show should be.
1618834	1620896	It feels very Facebook game to me.
1621736	1626440	The avatar designer is very disappointing, especially considering that you're playing on a PlayStation.
1626520	1628602	Why can't you just bring in my avatar from home?
1629062	1634003	You know, it has this whole system built into it, and maybe that's a Sony restriction, I don't know.
1634323	1636704	But it seems a little weird that you can't play with your actual avatars.
1637464	1642885	I tried to play the game online, could never find a room full of people to play it with, so didn't really get to test that.
1644485	1647206	And I think the questions in the game are really weird.
1647846	1651767	Like, it's just all the... There's no... You would think if I'm...
1652427	1654948	Press your luck on the PlayStation 3.
1655689	1661092	I would try to ask a lot of pop culture questions or questions geared towards 20 and 30 somethings.
1661132	1667455	But there's just a lot of like weird off the wall ancient history and obscure sports questions that seem to show up in there.
1667475	1668416	And it's kind of like, what?
1668916	1671438	Did they just go to a trivia book and yank all this shit out?
1671478	1671998	Like, I don't know.
1672358	1689734	probably what they did and there's a really weird like the single player mode is like playing through 16 episodes and your goal is to try and win each episode but the computer opponents have these different quirks so yeah weird but at the end of the day the game's only $10 so here's my thought
1690234	1712018	if you're bringing people over and you want to have laughs and you have three controllers and you want to have a fun little night this makes for a good board game substitute I don't think there's any substitute for an awesome board game like Clue or Monopoly or Catan or something like that but this is a fun little alternative you know I don't think it's anything I would take too seriously beyond that that's that's basically it for Press Your Luck um
1713338	1718901	Another game I've been playing this week is Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light, which is one of the new games that's on Xbox 360.
1719981	1721822	And I just want to give disclosure up front here.
1721902	1728745	A friend of mine actually worked on this game, so you may want to take what I'm about to say with a grain of salt, but I assure you that bears nothing on my opinion of this game.
1728965	1732767	And if I may say so, it was covered in last month's Retro Gamer.
1733687	1734108	Was it?
1734168	1735008	But it's not a retro game.
1735028	1735828	It just came out this week.
1736389	1739170	Oh, it must be because of the Tomb Raider history or whatever, maybe.
1739630	1743092	And there is a certain kind of retro-ish feeling about this game.
1743692	1747814	But as far as the game goes, I paid the $15 for it.
1747854	1748795	I played through the demo.
1749295	1752036	And I gotta say, it is awesome.
1752577	1756719	I think it is one of the better Xbox Live Arcade games to come out in a long time.
1757539	1758080	Here's the thing.
1758220	1762364	It doesn't really feel like Tomb Raider at all to me, and I think that's why they're not calling it Tomb Raider.
1762384	1767810	They're calling it this Lara Croft game, but I would honestly call it Gauntlet Legends is what it feels like more to me.
1767870	1777200	It's very arcade-feely with the score and the way the maps are and the isometric, but it's a good time.
1777980	1780701	I played through with Alan for about three hours on Friday night.
1780741	1784743	We were just kind of going through the different levels and the co-op is a lot of fun.
1785183	1787784	Like some of the puzzles are really cool.
1787844	1789165	Like there's all these different mechanics.
1789205	1798568	Like one of you plays as Lara Croft and she has a grappling hook that she can grab like little, I don't know, like little chains with.
1798608	1800249	She can grab them and then grapple over to them.
1800729	1816239	and then you can also play as Totec who is like an Aztec warrior and he can use a shield to either block projectiles or he can use the shield and hold it up and then Laura can jump on his shield or he can throw spears that then Laura can jump on.
1816599	1824364	So you really have to work together in order to be able to solve these different puzzles and it actually made for a lot of fun and we were kind of...
1825565	1850303	every level in that game it seems to end with this big climactic scene like for instance the end of the first level you think you're at the end and then all of a sudden the walls start to move and they they start to move in and it's going to push you over into the pit of spikes if you don't think quickly and you really have to work together like you have to jump up then you have to have Totec throw a spear you jump on the spear jump up use your grappling hook to grab Totec bring him up I mean it's
1850643	1853546	It sounds complicated the way I'm saying it, but it's all very fluid.
1853726	1857070	And the way it plays out, it executes a lot of fun.
1857110	1861594	And Alan and I are kind of yelling back and forth at each other like, no, no, no, do this, do this, do this.
1861834	1864857	And we actually fell in the spikes and died one time because we didn't have it together.
1864897	1866319	But then we figured it out the next time.
1867253	1868274	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1891512	1899178	I don't know the rhyme or reason for that, but honestly, I was playing it in-house, and it was fine, and we had a lot of fun.
1899498	1904402	I could see, though, where it's really lacking if you had somebody you wanted to play with, but that'll be fixed in a couple weeks, I guess.
1905603	1910807	And then the other thing is that—oh, there's something else.
1910827	1912308	There's another drawback I was trying to think of.
1913635	1914356	Character models are nice.
1929133	1954869	and the single player mode what they do they give Laura the spear and then they alter some of the puzzles so that you can still do everything by yourself and I found myself playing through the first level like seven times this afternoon because there's all these different little mini objectives and one of them is a speed objective clear the level as fast as you can and there are lots of little shortcuts you have to take one of them is a points objective take it slow kill everything get all the points grab the diamonds
1955209	1958432	So it gives a lot of different reasons to replay the game.
1958772	1961454	So I think it's absolutely worth checking out.
1961494	1969021	I think it's one of the better games to come out in a while and makes me excited about Tomb Raider games again, which I never thought I'd say since like 1997.
1969541	1971603	Do you feel all tingly and brand new?
1972765	1973285	I guess so.
1974166	1978128	But I guess they're reinvigorating the regular franchise too and if it's anything like this it's going to be awesome.
1978408	1981350	So yeah, I'm a big fan of Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light.
1981710	1983151	Definitely check out the demo if nothing else.
1983191	1986933	Demo's the first level and it'll give you a feel for the game.
1987373	1991255	Salacious Pop is in chat and actually says that would give home some purpose.
1991536	1992236	Can't have that.
1992276	1996838	That's in reference to the avatars on PlayStation 3 Press Your Luck.
1997839	1998319	There you go.
1999120	2003303	Alright, chat.orangelandradio.com if you want to join us in our chat room and give your own comments.
2003784	2006666	Let's get into some housekeeping tonight and then we'll get into some actual gaming news.
2006966	2007767	Housekeeping tonight.
2008087	2009588	We've been talking about a marathon episode.
2009648	2012631	It was brought up last week and we were kind of joking like, should we really do this?
2013191	2013791	We're going to do it.
2014031	2018053	We are going to do a long extended marathon episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
2018453	2022995	It's going to start next week live at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.
2023015	2026757	It's going to start at 2 o'clock Pacific, 5 o'clock Eastern.
2026797	2028278	So it's a little bit earlier than usual.
2028338	2029418	And 10 o'clock in London.
2029578	2029998	That's right.
2030058	2035201	So this also is kind of that, those of you overseas that have been wanting to listen, here's your chance.
2036221	2041084	So we're going to go for two to five with our normal show, quote unquote.
2041384	2044545	And then after that, we're going to just keep going into the wee morning hours.
2044585	2045766	We're going to go into the vault.
2045786	2049568	We're getting some extensions from the mic so we can actually go into the vault, play some old classic games.
2049808	2053550	We're going to field a lot of comments from our chat room and kind of the listeners.
2053630	2056872	We want to know some discussion topics you want to talk about during that time.
2057372	2058513	We'll be kind of asking you guys.
2058853	2062495	Loki, unfortunately, because of, you know, the baby and the wife and everything, he's only going to be here for the...
2063095	2063435	DarkSakura
2091056	2091316	All right.
2092017	2092817	As late as it can.
2093698	2095559	And let's see.
2095619	2097840	Ranma says, woohoo, time to alcohol down.
2097900	2101022	We are actually thinking about doing at the top of every hour.
2101162	2102283	It's happy hour somewhere.
2102823	2107125	And we'll actually take a drink of whatever country it happens to be happy hour in.
2107165	2108386	So tune in.
2108426	2109186	It's going to be a good time.
2109627	2109967	There you go.
2110563	2113125	Alright, I think that's it for housekeeping.
2113205	2113966	I don't have a whole lot else.

2119071	2120973	Visit our website at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
2120993	2125076	There's been a few forum posts over the past few weeks that have been nice and so on.
2125537	2127058	Let's get into some actual gaming news now.
2127178	2129000	Loki, what is going on in the gaming world?
2129721	2131282	Lots of stuff this week.
2131362	2133144	Starting off in this kind of...
2134104	2143606	It's a little frustrating for me because I had the opportunity to participate in this.
2144486	2154329	Unfortunately, due to emails being eaten by a spam filter, I missed out, I think.
2155169	2155949	I could be wrong, though.
2156809	2159870	But the Connect beta is starting right now.
2160230	2172755	Apparently, if you are part of the Microsoft Connect program, which I am, you get the occasional survey and beta test announcements and that kind of stuff.
2173115	2196950	Well, they sent out invites to, I'm not sure if it's all the members or some of the members, but people are getting invites to the Kinect beta, which they would actually send them a Kinect motion camera, as well as some software to test out, and the new dashboard update that's going to be coming out this fall, which includes some other cool stuff, including some audio enhancements and stuff like that.
2197450	2201171	So hopefully that means that everybody doesn't sound like a little kid.
2201231	2203652	It's weird.
2204752	2214856	Sometimes when I'm out sick or something, or I have to take time off for my wife or the kid or whatever, and I play against my coworkers at work, they sound like little kids over the mics.
2216456	2217797	Even though that's not what they sound like on...
2220077	2224298	It's just really weird how badly the audio is distorted.
2224358	2227099	So I'm hoping that that actually gets better.
2227239	2229899	Isn't the Kinect device, doesn't it have a microphone on it too?
2229919	2230619	It does, yeah.
2230659	2232260	Is this supposed to be able to capture the room noise?
2232540	2232720	It does.
2232740	2237061	So maybe they're doing audio enhancements to kind of better, you know, for the room talking.
2237101	2242702	Like if I'm sitting way back on the couch and Kinect's all the way in the front of the room, like it's got to use a different type of audio sensory.
2242882	2251771	Yes and no, but the reason why they're doing the upgrade to that is before, it's kind of like how our radio station was before on Live 365 or even the podcast.
2252172	2258278	How before we were kind of catering towards low bandwidth, 64K type stuff.
2258358	2262923	Now they're updating that because most people have broadband and that's why.
2262983	2263324	I see.
2263344	2265085	They have more bandwidth to play with.
2265946	2268708	Oh, you know, it might also be the closure of original Xbox.
2269988	2278173	That's possible, because it says basically that the basic codec had originally required just a 64K connection, and it's time for us to move on.
2279093	2288699	Especially if we want to think about broadening a crackly headset on top of your head, not what people think about when they're talking about popular entertainment.
2289419	2305915	and you know I agree the audio quality should be better so that I can actually hear what people are saying instead of just hearing mumbling because that's what I hear a lot of times yeah if you go back and listen to old episodes of Orange Lounge Radio I mean they're out there there's information on the forums just remember guys it was a very different show in 2002
2306716	2307316	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2328983	2338317	But basically, though, the beta testers will be getting, I guess, Connect Adventures, Connect Supports, and Connect Joyride beta versions of those as well.
2338538	2343445	And I do believe there's also a beta version of Dance Central as well that's being sent out because...
2344386	2347048	It's probably the five song demo that's been circulating.
2347649	2349370	Yeah, I think it's something similar to that.
2350251	2351151	So that'd be kind of cool.
2351192	2353133	And those are actually supposed to be sent out now.
2353914	2356976	You should have gotten an email letting you know that's going to happen.
2357777	2363121	Like I said, I didn't realize that I'd gotten this invite way back from like on the 8th.
2363782	2366284	So I just registered the other day.
2366864	2383593	but I'm crossing my fingers because not everybody that registers gets into it and I've been let into other beta programs so it would be nice because one, I like getting stuff early and two, I don't want to have to necessarily pay for this especially now with the baby and everything.
2383994	2387035	Well, just in case, Loki, this is for you for missing out.
2388416	2391300	There you go.
2391320	2392181	Thank you for that.
2392221	2392742	You're welcome.
2392782	2393182	Anytime.
2393242	2393943	What are friends for?
2394544	2397027	Go into our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
2397047	2404357	Tiger Claw says, Microsoft may improve the quality of the voice chat, but still have yet to improve the quality of the people behind the voice chat.
2404377	2404997	That is true.
2405638	2406299	It's true.
2406599	2410924	You will be able to hear all the horrible insults from 12-year-olds in high fidelity now.
2410984	2417872	Now you can hear F star star K, N I star star star, F star G, and all those wonderful words.
2417892	2419274	That would be awesome, though.
2419834	2420215	Yeah.
2420495	2431298	You know how they have the really bad voice dubbing in those made-for-TV, or not even necessarily made-for-TV, but how they have the television cable-friendly versions of movies and stuff?
2432259	2440161	The really bad ones where they'll actually change words to hot dog or kazoo or some weird-ass word.
2440801	2445503	It would be funny if they had some sort of algorithm to detect what people are saying and to kind of do that on the fly.
2445863	2447484	Uh, wasn't there a story?
2447744	2453587	I mean, it was some time ago, like a couple years ago, about a patent filed by... I want to say it was Microsoft.
2454367	2459070	It was a long time ago, but I want to say we talked about a story, because we had a good laugh at it, about that type of technology.
2459410	2462291	That it could actually understand the word fuck, and it would replace it.
2462611	2467214	And I don't know, like, part of me wants to say it came out the next week, that it was all a lie, it was a red herring, it was a joke, but...
2467794	2468074	I don't know.
2468094	2469816	I want to say that story was out there for some reason.
2469836	2470277	It was a while ago.
2470317	2471218	It would be funny, though.
2471238	2474441	It would be interesting if this might be the implementation of such technology.
2474461	2475162	Nah, I doubt it.
2475402	2475462	Huh?
2476063	2477064	Yeah.
2477124	2477424	Let's see.
2478586	2480808	Shadowrunner in our chat says, People still have dial-up.
2480848	2481629	I thought that died.
2481989	2484472	And Actdeft says, Dial-up still exists, believe it or not.
2484732	2485933	You know, a lot of people are still on dial-up.
2485953	2487575	My parents are still on dial-up.
2487915	2488916	They will not switch.
2488997	2490038	They say it's too expensive.
2490458	2492881	Some people live in the woods where everything is interrupted by trees
2508718	2534301	or something else to consider other countries like you know do you think some countries outside of America, Europe, Japan are as wired for I guess when I say Europe I mean Britain and the surrounding countries don't send your emails saying Europe is not a country but you know what I mean like a lot of those areas are regions if I should say are better wired for internet than others you know what I mean
2535241	2541985	So if Xbox is going to kind of ramp up the connection you need, they're kind of giving the finger to these people, right?
2542005	2545827	Not really, because you can't really play on Xbox Live with dial-up.
2547384	2549125	So, who cares?
2550245	2552926	But you can play with, like, can't you play with the satellite link?
2553146	2557348	Which isn't, it's faster than dial-up, but it's definitely not as fast as cable or even DSL, right?
2557368	2563090	We may have connection issues, because that's just like playing on our work, you know, network.
2563451	2568172	The connection's not very quick, and we get a lot of disconnects because of that.
2568353	2571134	But, it still works when it works, you know.
2572114	2575415	Ranma in our chat says, most ISPs are offering cable modem service for $19.99.
2576055	2577255	You know what?
2578275	2579315	I probably believe you.
2579355	2581136	I probably should help my parents price this.
2581196	2588557	But I kind of secretly think that my mom is just telling my dad it's too expensive because she knows that if they buy it, he'll be on the internet all the time.
2589037	2592998	But I'm also thinking my mother is starting to learn how to use the internet and use email.
2593038	2594598	So why wouldn't she want faster internet?
2594838	2595179	I don't know.
2595539	2596439	I guess you'll have to ask them.
2596979	2597359	So there you go.
2597782	2599283	Anything else about the Kinect program, Loki?
2599323	2600384	Anything else to know?
2600464	2602245	I mean, this is just around the corner at this point, right?
2602265	2602926	About two months away?
2603646	2605788	Well, the Kinect, yeah, is coming out November 4th.
2605888	2610791	The actual devices will be out as soon as Microsoft sends them out.
2611151	2612032	Let me ask this question.
2612092	2613733	Why are they doing a beta program for this?
2613773	2617756	It seems weird because we haven't heard of a lot of hardware beta tests.
2617796	2623520	I mean, the last one I can remember is the PlayStation 2 hard drive for Final Fantasy XI, but I don't hear of this a lot.
2624644	2627796	It's really kind of unusual for them to be doing a lot of these.
2628217	2629141	I would think it's just...
2631025	2632025	Word of mouth, maybe.
2632765	2634246	Getting people excited about it.
2634926	2640787	There's a vast amount of NDA items on there.
2640847	2647249	They're basically not wanting people to share what's included in the new dashboard update and all this stuff.
2647369	2650509	But people talk anyways, and I think that they realize that.
2650729	2654670	It's just kind of like, ooh, information I'm not supposed to know.
2654750	2656151	I'm more interested now.
2656191	2657391	Instead of just
2659455	2662678	So the whole thing is just a marketing thing.
2664540	2668784	But I'm sure at the same time, though, there is some troubleshooting stuff that they're probably doing.
2669405	2676151	Just seeing, hey, are there any bugs that we haven't thought of yet that maybe are in this that we could patch day one or something?
2677553	2678274	That kind of stuff.
2678894	2679094	But...
2679915	2681636	I'm curious how well that video chat works.
2681696	2682396	I just want one.
2682676	2683117	That's all.
2683477	2686058	Because I was actually kind of interested in the Kinect stuff.
2686718	2690800	The move I could care less about, but it would be kind of fun.
2690960	2696663	I would like to try out Dance Masters before it comes out so I don't look like a total tool trying to play the game.
2697743	2698364	Good luck with that.
2699004	2702786	I mean, you know, it's all...
2704153	2705494	Yes, I understand.
2705534	2706474	Yeah, there's a lot.
2707074	2712656	The thing is, when you look at choreographed dancing, it looks stupid if one person's doing it.
2712776	2716538	If a bunch of people are doing it at the same time, it looks cool because it's all in sync.
2716878	2718879	But when one person's doing it, it's not so cool.
2719219	2719459	You mean...
2720379	2737015	or Para Para Paradise exactly like one person playing that game usually looked a little bit ridiculous but when everybody would stand behind the machine doing the same dance like people would walk up like how do they know that what do they do what it's a cult that game is a cult it's a trap
2737976	2739178	Yeah, so that's the thing.
2739759	2742943	They're going to have the routines from the music videos for some of these songs.
2743684	2745286	And yeah, it'll be kind of cool.
2745306	2747989	You're going to have a bunch of people doing it.
2748070	2753377	But can you imagine a bunch of sober people doing this together?
2753837	2754678	I can't imagine that.
2755058	2758842	All I can imagine is, hey, I'm going to play Dance Masters, and everyone's going, ha ha, you look stupid.
2758862	2764147	You know what's going to be awesome is learning on Dance Central, let's say, how to dance to Poker Face.
2764167	2765788	Dance Central, I mean, not Dance Masters.
2765848	2767390	Dance Masters look stupid.
2768010	2768391	Well, whatever.
2768631	2771273	But let's say you learn the dance to, I don't know,
2772174	2773355	Poker Face Poker Face
2793351	2794212	Thanks for watching!
2814557	2815457	I digress.
2815617	2821239	I think any time you have a group of three or more all doing the same thing, no matter what it is, like in sync, it's going to be interesting.
2821979	2822479	I think it is.
2822899	2823699	At least... You look weird.
2824000	2830361	I mean, at least be... It kind of reminds me of when I used to go to the club a long time ago.
2831081	2839384	There was a guy that looked like he... It was literally like some grandpa dressed up like Michael Jackson doing stuff, and it didn't matter what he was doing.
2839644	2840904	It's interesting because you're like...
2842216	2844017	That's something I don't see every day.
2844238	2845299	And that's the other thing, too.
2845339	2846660	I mean, it'll get people's attention.
2846980	2849642	And really, going to clubs, that's all what it's about.
2849742	2851083	It's getting people's attention.
2851403	2853365	Because, you know, that's what you crave.
2854046	2859410	I don't know how often you've been to gay bars, Loki, but that's like all the people there on the dance floor.
2859790	2861712	All that old man in the thriller outfit.
2861772	2866215	Like, it takes a lot to stand out like that at a gay bar.
2867116	2867837	It really does.
2870178	2876784	The one I remember is this fierce old drag queen that used to wear a leotard looking like Jane Fonda out of the 1980s.
2877164	2879627	They used to do goth dancing to pop songs.
2880628	2882069	That was unique.
2883330	2884191	That is unique.
2884271	2888335	That's plenty of genres right there.
2888375	2888855	That's right.
2890377	2892198	Well, you know, America's the melting pot, so...
2896339	2897140	That sounds divine.
2898800	2904583	There will be interest in Dance Central because look at how well Just Dance did.
2905204	2906924	That came out of fucking nowhere.
2907385	2909506	Just Dance is top of the charts for weeks.
2909586	2912327	It's still a really popular Wii game.
2912807	2914348	Where the hell did that come from?
2914708	2921472	So if that has that kind of popularity and we get the kind of support from Harmonix with this,
2921932	2922653	It'll be awesome.
2925116	2927018	Which, if they're given money, you know they will.
2927479	2929121	Yes, I'm hoping the support's awesome.
2930082	2939933	On the other hand, Dance Masters, Konami promises download content, but I have yet to see them actually come through with the download content.
2939953	2940494	We'll see, we'll see.
2940514	2940955	You never know.
2942396	2943698	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2963340	2965883	It does have a pretty extensive song library, I gotta say.
2965983	2974292	I was surprised, because I was expecting the library to be nothing but the same old damn songs from 4th Mix, 5th Mix, Max, Max 2, Extreme.
2974472	2976034	You know, all the same old songs, but it wasn't.
2976054	2977255	There was a lot of different stuff in there.
2979493	2990137	I know You Can't Touch Us is actually in DDRX, and I think Just Dance might be in one of the newer They probably are from other DDR games, but I was just surprised that they were licenses.
2990857	2992798	No matter what it is, they are commercial songs.
2992818	2995339	You know, they are still coming out with Dance Dance Revolution.
2995359	2998540	Remember how they were going back to Dance Dance Revolution to make it really confusing?
2999420	3000881	For the PS3 and the Wii.
3001061	3001761	It's the Move one.
3002341	3003402	Oh, they're different games.
3003482	3005983	Dance Dance Revolution on the Wii is just an extension of Hottest Party.
3007003	3010204	They're not saying it, but it's the same old balance board mode and all that stuff.
3010224	3011584	And then the one on the PS3 is the move.
3012025	3014745	And then the 360 is not getting DDR, it's getting Dance Masters.
3014785	3015426	That's how it's working.
3015566	3015706	Yeah.
3016046	3016386	There it is.
3017326	3017606	All right.
3018386	3020707	Hope you wrote down what I said really fast if you need an explanation.
3020927	3026249	And something you could use to write down real fast is a peripheral we talked about last week on the show, the U-Draw.
3026309	3026769	Remember this?
3027149	3027809	Nice segue.
3028249	3029249	Yeah, that's awesome, huh?
3029510	3036572	The U-Draw was the third-party tablet that they were, I believe THQ was making it to do like a Pictionary game, and there was another game that they were making with this.
3036652	3040754	Well, there's Adventure, and there's also some actual drawing game that comes with the tablet.
3040874	3042594	I'm glad someone was paying attention last week.
3042634	3049157	All right, well, there's a rumor out this week, and it's being run on GoNintendo.com, which, you know, they love their Nintendo over there.
3049817	3053220	I guess they have a tipster who says they have inside info on the U-Draw.
3053240	3058564	And I'm thinking if I'm GoNintendo, I don't run with this unless I know that there is some clout to this.
3058805	3059925	They've been around a little while.
3060506	3061707	So here's the quote.
3063028	3073716	Both games, talking about Nintendo themselves getting into making games for the U-Draw, are designed with the mass market gamer in mind, yet honor the passion of traditional gamers.
3074277	3078060	And of course, one of the huge speculations right off the bat, Mario Paint.
3078320	3079981	Finally, a new Mario Paint on the Wii.
3080021	3081001	Could it really be happening?
3081041	3082982	That'd be awesome.
3083122	3086164	GoNintendo also speculates Kirby Canvas Curse, perhaps.
3086604	3089045	Although, honestly, insert any DS game here.
3089405	3090746	They can make an adaptation for it on the Wii.
3090766	3093907	I don't know if they would do another Kirby game that soon after Kirby's Epic Yarn, but...
3094187	3097228	But if they're making it now, it probably wouldn't be out until next Christmas, right?
3097248	3099228	I want a Mario Paint, and I want the music mode.
3099368	3110210	I think a Mario Paint would be great, although I believe it's one of those games you sort of see through retro-colored glasses where it was awesome when you were 12, but now it's... But the music mode was pretty rad.
3111290	3113651	And there's still like a cultish community for that.
3114511	3116451	There's an emulator for just the music mode.
3116571	3119632	Okay, imagine if they brought back Mario Paint.
3119892	3120032	Just...
3120652	3121233	DarkSakura.com
3137271	3138472	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
3154401	3155301	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3183234	3183815	What a concept!
3201024	3224414	you have those SD cards that you can put in the slot on the Wii, imagine if the chiptune music making mode in this hypothetical Mario Paint game that I've completely made up, you could export MP3s to the SD card, oh my god it wouldn't be MP3s, oh my god it would be AAC files because remember they don't support MP3s anymore, okay fine, AACs then still, still it'd be amazing
3226214	3250653	and while you're at it you release a DS version or a DSi version that comes out as well where not only can you draw stuff but you can take pictures of things and then you know edit them and do all that fun stuff alright well what do you guys think the other game could possibly be Mario Paint I think is the number one fanboy request what would be the other one if you were making a game for Udraw in a Nintendo franchise what do you think it could be
3254607	3271510	Magic Pen Gel It's on Nintendo franchise That would be awesome Maybe if Nintendo made an RPG or something like that I don't think I played That game was so sweet Graffiti Kingdom, I remember that came out That was pretty awesome too, but I didn't play that very much
3271812	3277496	I'm gonna say the other drawing game is a generic Wii blank game.
3277857	3285483	Like, Wii Party, Wii Sports, Wii... One of those, what's the island called now that they have all these games on, and the Wii Fit?
3286023	3287324	There's gonna be a Wii Draw.
3287464	3289265	That's the other Nintendo, it's just Wii Draw.
3290106	3292028	Of course, then again, that would just be Mario Paint, wouldn't it?
3292288	3293910	So maybe that's what you're getting instead of Mario Paint.
3293930	3297573	What if they had it where you can play Pikmin on it or something like that?
3297854	3298694	Ah, now you're talking.
3298815	3300156	Or like an RTS of some sort.
3300176	3301537	A recreation of the stylus.
3303759	3304600	Like with DS games.
3305021	3309205	Imagine how much easier, by the way, playing Cooking Mama on the Wii would be.
3310946	3311507	With a U-Draw.
3311809	3312810	Yeah, perhaps.
3313330	3315391	Well, you know, it's not Cooking Mama anymore.
3315431	3316471	It's Crafting Mama.
3317072	3317952	That's the next one.
3318372	3320233	The other thing I wanted to say about this real quick.
3320494	3324796	Isn't it weird, though, that you have a first-party person supporting a third-party device?
3325436	3330759	Like, if Nintendo was planning on making games for this, wouldn't they just suddenly say, me?
3330959	3334320	Maybe we want to buy this and make it a first-party peripheral.
3334360	3337700	It seems weird to me that THQ is putting this out, but Nintendo is supporting it.
3337740	3339461	These things are supposed to work in reverse.
3339681	3344982	Not necessarily, because they could just team up with them and have it actually where they release the peripheral.
3345042	3347162	It'll probably be bundled with one of their games.
3347242	3351963	If they came out with a MarioPay, for example, it would be bundled with the UDraw tablet.
3352103	3354843	It's just made by third parties.
3354883	3355844	It's kind of like... Well...
3360376	3363320	DarkSakura, speaking of firsts, she hasn't gotten to give us a news story tonight yet.
3381252	3383415	Okay, how about some stuff for Red Dead Redemption?
3384136	3384717	A.K.A.
3384817	3386119	Grand Theft Horse.
3386980	3394872	And I hate that these stupid ads on the side that they want to completely cover the entire page and not give me the little button to close the damn thing.
3395533	3395693	There.
3396613	3400275	Anyway, this is for Red Dead Redemption.
3400295	3402936	The Liars and Cheats Pack has a date in the UK.
3403636	3407578	And for the PS3 and 360, it will be released on the 21st of September.
3408178	3413300	It will be £7.99 on PlayStation Network and 800 Microsoft Points.
3415021	3417102	That's roughly €9.60 in Euros.
3417162	3417202	So...
3419543	3426747	It was going to be free, but they've decided to make it super nice, and then they can give away free packs.
3427547	3429769	Anyway, it's going to have different multiplayer modes.
3429869	3433511	One called Stronghold, where you take turns as attack and defense.
3434131	3442476	Multiplayer horse races, poker, liar's dice, an explosive rifle, gang hideouts, hunting grounds.
3444857	3450002	and 15 of the characters in story mode will be playable character skins.
3450583	3451283	So that's cool.
3454046	3460752	So Loki, you play a lot of Grand Theft Auto at work and DarkSakura made a joke calling it Grand Theft Horse.
3460792	3463375	Why do you think Red Dead Redemption hasn't caught on with your little crowd?
3464306	3465267	Thanks for watching!
3483269	3488071	to a deathmatch location on the map, and then you have to trigger it and invite your other people in there.
3488651	3494573	And if it's anything like the times we've tried to set up before, the game's really dumb as far as setting up games.
3495613	3505536	Like, for example, we set up a deathmatch one time, and I invited everybody, they accepted, and it started loading the game, and then we ended up in the three separate deathmatches where we were the only player there.
3506357	3507157	I was like, what the hell?
3507837	3512762	So, that's why we don't play Red Dead Redemption right now.
3513083	3515445	We've been just playing Grand Theft Auto.
3516126	3517787	You know, it's fun to stick with.
3518288	3523173	Plus, they're really itching for me to get the mod game back up again so we can play that again.
3523473	3526096	Because that was some of the best games we've ever played.
3527457	3540244	and the best part about it is the guy that made one of the mod tools open for they have a beta version that's out there now that I signed up for the beta for that and the new version allows us to edit the files for Red Dead Redemption.
3541685	3542906	Make your own expansion pack.
3542966	3546988	But it's a very different format so that's something I need to explore.
3547368	3553592	I have to dump it to my hard drive first but it'll be interesting to check that out.
3555060	3557545	I also had another bit for this story as well.
3559369	3564641	For Red Dead Redemption there's a rumor going around that they're casting for the movie and asked Brad Pitt.
3565851	3568273	Wow, I just saw that comment from TigerClaw in our chatroom too.
3568313	3570215	It was saying that at chat.orangecountry.com.
3570235	3573458	He said, oh yeah, you heard that Brad Pitt might star in a Red Dead Redemption movie.
3573839	3575440	Why does that sound like fanboy wank to me?
3575640	3576861	It sounds like fanboy wank to me.
3576982	3583428	Well, according to this, they've given him first refusal on it.
3583548	3584569	So, I don't know.
3585598	3597427	You know, I also heard, I saw on LiveJournal or somewhere that apparently they cast, what's his name from Lost, Matthew Fox as the main guy in Mass Effect, which I guess they're making an actual movie out of.
3597507	3599929	And I looked at that and I said, boy, that sounds like Fanboy Wank.
3601490	3603532	I didn't even know they were going to make a legitimate Mass Effect movie.
3603552	3605093	I thought they would wait until the trilogy is done.
3606014	3606154	But...
3606747	3608729	Maybe they're going to try to release it at the same time?
3608809	3609150	I don't know.
3610151	3612854	Well, I have to check and see.
3612914	3620762	I didn't read the show roll all the way yet, but there was another movie thing that I don't remember if we're talking about it or not.
3623665	3623786	Uh...
3624366	3625106	I don't think so.
3625126	3625667	I don't think so.
3625707	3626707	If we spoil it, we spoil it.
3626727	3627067	Oops.
3627107	3628868	Whatever, okay.
3630469	3639093	Honestly, I am not familiar with this series because I don't own an iPhone or something like that, but was it Big Angry Bird or something like that?
3639333	3639733	Oh, yeah.
3639813	3641454	I've heard of Angry Birds.
3641514	3642074	Angry Birds.
3642534	3644275	So they're supposed to be making a movie out of that.
3644455	3648097	That sounds dumb, but I don't know.
3650365	3650785	Interesting.
3650805	3653468	I don't know what kind of game you'd make out of that, but whatever.
3653828	3662815	I think what it's come down to is the movie industry is really hurting for original ideas, so now they're trying to just develop everything into a movie.
3663396	3674725	A perfect example of that is the whole Hasbro licensing with the Ouija game, the movie, or Battleship the movie, or Monopoly the movie.
3674825	3676106	They did Ouija the movie.
3676126	3677087	It was called The Exorcist.
3678217	3680739	or this nonsense that they're remaking Clue the movie.
3681119	3685363	They're not remaking the 80s version of Clue which will always be a timeless classic.
3686184	3697673	They're just going to make a new movie based off a Clue that'll be I'm sure it's wonderful of a piece of cinema as the Clue 2 Murder in Disguise VCR game where you get to see Mr. Green dressed up as Madam Rose.
3697733	3698694	It was quality cinema.
3700962	3702284	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3716660	3722228	and it is being dealt with swiftly by Sony as well.
3724170	3734304	It was confirmed, I guess, by a bunch of different sources that despite the fact that one video showed it running on a dev console, it is actually the real deal.
3735444	3737205	It's actually sold out as well.
3737945	3745929	And, of course, it goes without saying that Sony, they say they have a way to detect whether you're running it or not, and they will ban you.
3746009	3749730	So, buyer beware, I suppose.
3750931	3755993	And apparently, I guess the device is kind of similar to the Pandora battery that was on the PSP.
3757034	3757794	Thanks for watching!
3773150	3785474	and Sony Australia has granted a temporary injunction by the federal court to block the importation and sale of the new mod chips as well.
3785894	3788775	It is a temporary injunction, means until August 31st.
3789335	3793736	So during that time, actually Sony will have, I guess...
3795077	3800822	They're the only ones that they can be sold to, and I'm not sure if they actually get to seize the hardware or whatever.
3801363	3804626	But this device wasn't made in Australia, right?
3805547	3815616	This isn't made in Australia, but Oz Modchips was one of the first modchip resellers that had these chips.
3815717	3815917	So...
3817458	3817798	I don't know.
3817818	3820419	I guess it blocks something.
3821920	3822280	We'll see.
3822420	3824421	August 31st is a couple days away.
3825801	3831403	Especially if they aren't granted an extension on that, you better believe it.
3831423	3834364	They're going to kick that shit out of the door immediately.
3835925	3840089	Or you could just import one from the US, Canada, Switzerland, right?
3840189	3840609	Exactly.
3840850	3848657	So, unless, unless, and I don't know, unless maybe they were the first ones to get it, and then those companies are buying it from Osmodchips, who knows.
3850538	3857124	And so, of course, you have the, basically, the temporary injunction does halt the sale to anyone but Sony.
3857825	3858305	Apparently...
3860366	3864048	They are legally forced to sell the PS jailbreaks to Sony.
3866228	3870810	And in any case, I guess they have a chance to figure out how the thing works.
3871790	3874311	In the meantime, I'm sure that they could buy one anyways.
3875431	3877292	They probably will try to figure out how it works.
3877672	3882734	And if anything, it probably works very similar to the way their dev kit stuff works.
3883915	3910238	and then of course the reason why they're trying to or they got the temporary injunction anyways is saying that apparently the device uses some sort of code that's from the dev kit or something like that that is proprietary and that it's violating whatever of course whoever is making these chips actually are saying that they don't use any of that stuff
3911278	3913719	and they aren't too worried by what's going on.
3914059	3918441	They're saying there was kind of a short back and forth Q&A with them.
3920462	3924683	It says companies in Australia get a lot of problems.
3925063	3927524	Sony halts Australian resellers.
3928665	3929685	Is this a big problem?
3929965	3932546	And it says it's a temporary injunction until August 31st.
3933386	3934427	We'll be reached then.
3934527	3936007	Nothing illegal has been done.
3936327	3937628	It's just a scare tactic.
3938548	3944395	and it says there's no copyright code and we have not interfered with any intellectual property laws.
3945056	3947579	The device is designed for homebrew, nothing illegal.
3949727	3954210	I guess you can say nothing illegal, but obviously it can be used both ways.
3955771	3959294	The product is very different from every other mod.
3959394	3960054	Nothing illegal.
3960274	3962956	Once again, reinforcing that.
3964057	3967600	Yes, but all these shops returning customers' money back.
3968000	3970201	People informed saying the order's canceled.
3970341	3971843	It says it's just a scare tactic.
3971923	3972963	It's obviously working.
3973564	3974985	It will work in Europe also.
3975005	3976566	Yeah.
3978618	3979179	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3995800	3997062	Thank you for watching!
4014727	4015168	We'll see.
4015869	4023464	Like I said, I have one on order for the hell of it because I like to get everything, especially stuff that people don't want me to have.
4024907	4025608	Nice rationale.
4026519	4027140	Whatever.
4027240	4029201	I don't have to justify it.
4030162	4031383	I spend plenty of money on games.
4032964	4036367	I have one on order and I'm not worried about it.
4036827	4045394	Like they said, if for some reason Sony does put some permanent injunction and prevents them from selling it, I get my money back.
4046335	4047796	If they don't, I get a mod chip.
4048116	4051179	I don't see how I lose out in this scenario.
4052320	4052920	It's not a big deal.
4054341	4054621	All right.
4055002	4061146	Well, I don't know if the jailbreak will help out with this situation if it's adopted by Sony, but it's something that's becoming more and more popular.
4061206	4062927	We've talked about it quite at length on this show.
4063447	4064888	It's the online pass.
4065048	4065889	Yeah, you remember that?
4066529	4072513	It's showing up in the EA Sports Games now, and I think THQ, Ubisoft supposedly is putting this on board.
4074074	4085140	And if you don't remember what the online pass is, it's where you pay $10 if you buy the game used for a code so that you can actually play the game online and unlock other features.
4086600	4088341	It's locked out if you don't have the code.
4088501	4091063	Obviously, if you buy the game new, it comes with a code.
4091503	4093904	Well, guess what company is supposedly getting on board?
4094605	4095045	Sony.
4095545	4098287	That's right, Sony themselves for their first party games.
4098627	4101988	This is a comment from Sony Computer Entertainment Europe, Andrew House.
4102389	4103449	Quote, Because of mod chips like this.
4118210	4118911	I mean, think about it.
4118991	4119691	That's one way.
4119791	4124334	Well, we'll prevent people from getting online because they won't have access to a code to get online.
4124394	4129437	Therefore, you know, enticing people to buy games.
4130118	4136982	Now, of course, this story made rounds all over the Internet because, you know, hearing Sony's going to jump on board gets, you know, people's ears perked.
4137022	4140684	But I like this particular perspective on it that was on Destructoid.
4141304	4143846	One of their authors over there when they ran the story said this.
4143986	4145147	I thought this was very good.
4145367	4146588	Again, this is from Destructoid.com.
4147948	4151410	quote, it seems that this is most certainly the future of online play.
4151550	4152851	Buy new or pay for it.
4153191	4154231	I still think it's ludicrous.
4154272	4158313	The industry relies more on trading credit than I think any publisher will want to admit.
4158674	4167718	And if trade-in values are diminished because of this, well, good luck trying to compete in an already competitive market when gamers find themselves even less able to afford your $60 luxuries.
4168238	4174141	And sums it up with this, the author does, if used games disappeared tomorrow, the market would crash.
4174661	4175682	I guarantee it.
4177176	4177796	I think that's true.
4177816	4181098	He makes an interesting point.
4181578	4183999	It's a really interesting point.
4184060	4187241	Well, it is an interesting point and here's my point to it right now.
4187741	4192064	As of right now, the stuff that they seem to be targeting is sports games.
4193264	4212697	I don't know if you're a sports gamer or if you should take offense to that because really they're the ones that they seem to be targeting because right now it's just UFC 2010, Tiger Woods 2011, NCAA 11, Madden 11, and then of course SmackDown vs. Raw 11.
4213357	4220122	Those are all if you would consider sports titles right now and they're also talking that this is going to be done in I guess MLB The Show 11.
4220162	4220262	Yeah.
4220882	4228387	It's interesting that you say that because Ranma in our chatroom at chat.orange.online.com says, I have no problem with the online pass since they're just for sports games.
4228887	4232209	Once it passes to non-sports games, then I'll have a problem with it.
4233445	4236447	It seems to me there's different types of gamers too.
4236527	4254142	You have people that buy their systems, their consoles, and this is a significant amount of people for nothing but Madden, NBA, and a lot of those games that Loki named save for the occasional Halo, Call of Duty, and those types of mega games.
4254623	4260468	And then you have kind of the gamers like I think the majority of the people that listen to our show that like to play some of the more
4261168	4266550	And of course, there's some crossovers.
4266590	4268831	I'm not saying none of you like to play sports games.
4268891	4272312	Even I like Double Dribble and Blades of Steel and some of those old school sports games.
4272592	4273292	But you know what I mean.
4273653	4279055	Like, you know, there definitely is kind of two factions of gaming, if you will.
4279435	4282856	So it is interesting that only this one seems to be impacted so far by this.
4283416	4288538	And something I would like to add is a story that didn't make our show roll, but I thought it was very interesting.
4289966	4298733	Ballsy of them to be making this sort of argument, but THQ basically called people that buy used games cheaters.
4299133	4304037	Like they're cheating the devs out of their hard-earned money or something.
4304737	4305058	That's...
4305666	4306507	That's ridiculous.
4306547	4308829	That's just kind of an ignorant argument.
4308949	4322279	I'm trying to see where they're coming from, but that's very ignorant to the world we live in because does Paramount Pictures and 20th Century Fox say that about used DVD sales and used Blu-ray sales?
4324241	4325542	What is a garage sale?
4325722	4327203	Is a garage sale a cheating...
4328364	4329525	Party.
4330345	4333447	I mean, selling your old shit is a part of American culture.
4333467	4337649	Here's what I don't understand that they're complaining anyways because here's the thing.
4338350	4343913	When they've sold it to their retailer, they've already sold their copies to the retailer.
4343953	4344753	They have their money.
4345173	4353598	It's up to the retailer to decide, hey, if people are buying used copies, then that sucks for me because I still have this new copy on the shelf or something like that.
4354058	4354479	But I don't...
4355655	4366788	THQ's Corey Ledesma said, I don't think we really care whether used game buyers are upset because new game buyers get everything.
4369171	4375017	So if used game buyers are upset that they don't get online features set, I don't really have much sympathy for them.
4376478	4379540	That's a little blunt, but we hope it doesn't disappoint people.
4380080	4385563	We hope that people understand that when the game is used, we get cheated.
4387343	4392946	I don't see how you get cheated because there's still the same amount of people playing your damn game that there were before.
4395158	4397339	I don't understand how that you're cheated.
4397419	4402541	And if anything, say someone buys it used and they like it, then they go out and buy the next version.
4402581	4407242	Say, you know, I bought Saints Row 1 used or something like that, and I'm like, whoa, this is an awesome game.
4407302	4409723	And then Saints Row 2 comes out, I buy it new day one.
4410263	4415345	I don't understand how they lose out on this, but I'll tell you something, I'm not fucking buying your sports games, so...
4417226	4431103	whatever and I'll tell you what man I'll think twice about buying your other games if you have this kind of crap or the U-Draw which we talked about earlier in the show well the U-Draw is not going to have that because Wii doesn't really do online stuff too much and that's not really what they're going after but
4431844	4436226	It's still retarded to think that... It's still the same company.
4436246	4439147	And they've made excuses left and right.
4439327	4441088	Oh, we get cheated out of stuff.
4441468	4442248	Well, wait a second.
4442268	4446690	You get cheated because you're not selling a new copy and so you're trying to entice people to buy new copies?
4446990	4453532	But I thought before you were saying that you needed this extra money to support your online services that you're now providing extra options for.
4453952	4460195	Oh, wait, but now you're just saying that it's because all these used sales are really cutting into your profits.
4461977	4467520	Be glad you're selling copies at all because if you keep this kind of attitude up, you know, hey, let me tell you this much.
4467560	4469541	It hasn't helped Activision too much.
4471343	4473664	I got to go to our chat room, chat.orange.com.
4473724	4480828	Ranma just kind of takes one glove off and slaps THQ across the face saying, no, the companies that market the games at $59.99 are cheaters.
4483124	4511517	and the other thing too is on top of all that stuff calling these people cheaters and stuff you're putting out these sports games and I don't want to make generic you know I don't want to put out generic opinions of these sports games but a lot of people kind of agree that a lot of times these are just kind of roster updates that they put out each year and well to be fair it's the way that that faction looks at music games exactly and don't get me wrong I mean a lot of music games out there especially the Guitar Freak series
4512077	4515980	is just a different song list each year, and that's it.
4516360	4521443	But, I mean, it's not like vast improvements between each game.
4523405	4527107	And the fact that they're saying, oh, well, we want you to pay extra money for this.
4527487	4531830	Oh, and then we have this download content that could have been added in there for free, but we want a little bit more money.
4532591	4535753	And, oh, now you bought a used, so now you have to pay for online access.
4535813	4536433	But guess what?
4537354	4541757	Maybe the used players will learn not to really give a shit about the online access.
4542117	4543157	Then what are you gonna do?
4543618	4549220	Oh, look, they bought all your used games, you're still getting cheated, and they're not buying your stupid, you know, internet access.
4549300	4550660	Let me get to other chatroom comments.
4551040	4555242	Actdeft in our chatroom says, Don't know, the used DVDs and Blu-ray market ain't that big.
4555842	4558583	Keep in mind, he's in another country, so I don't know if...
4559163	4566129	If that changes the perspective, I mean, I think if there's a store here that does nothing but sell used DVDs and that sort of thing.
4566169	4580200	I can tell you right now that the studios don't like used sales because at one time we were buying, because, you know, Redbox and stuff, they turn over their DVDs quite quick and they have to offload all that used product.
4580240	4582461	Well, we used to buy it and then turn around and sell it.
4583322	4583702	DarkSakura.com
4609049	4637693	um Actdeft goes on to say they're cheated out of the money they should have supposed to get with the sale of the new game uh let's see Ranma says I'm sorry THQ wrestling games are not sports games since WWE and so on is sports entertainment Satellite Minded says people are already paying to play games online why do they have to pay more for content that's on the disc and Tiger Claw says it all comes down to one word greed and I agree and you know what um it's kind of funny though like
4639443	4650068	If Microsoft did this, I think there would be a shit storm because people are already paying for online access and they'd be like, why the fuck do I have to pay for more online access?
4650088	4651188	It's probably why they don't.
4652008	4653389	It's probably smart to do this.
4654329	4655950	Let's see how it plays out over there.
4656130	4657451	It's not a popular idea.
4658951	4660272	I just don't think it's necessary.
4661873	4662753	Here's what you need to do.
4663033	4666775	It's so simple and a lot of times they're doing it already, but
4667575	4671896	All you gotta do is just sell download content, you know?
4672197	4680960	You don't even necessarily have to, you know, cut stuff out of your game, but just support it with download content and you'll make a lot of money back, whether they bought it new or used.
4681020	4687982	If they bought it new, great, you make that sale and you make additional money, but if they bought it used, they're still buying download content.
4689238	4691701	and I don't see how you lose out of that because that's digital.
4691741	4693103	It's pure profit pretty much.
4694385	4694705	All right.
4695006	4695627	Let's move on.
4695907	4697709	We spent a lot of time on this topic.
4697769	4699251	We've got a lot more stories to cover.
4699652	4706581	Speaking of legal things, I believe DarkSakura's got a more legally oriented story for us that could also be setting a precedent soon for the future of games.
4706895	4707837	That I do.
4709018	4715587	There is a case that was... The U.S.
4715627	4721755	Supreme Court is going to be reviewing Schwarzenegger vs. the Entertainment Merchants Association.
4722516	4733780	about a law that they're trying to get passed here that would put fines on renting or selling violent games to kids.
4735241	4747866	The way they're trying to get around the First Amendment rule is that they're easier to get their hands on and would cause more immediate harm than seeing it through TV movies or the internet.
4749369	4752950	How is buying a video game easier than TV?
4753990	4755650	You turn a box on.
4757051	4758051	That astounds me.
4758131	4759471	That's a bold argument.
4759491	4760351	It's dumb.
4760591	4762592	I don't understand why they're making this argument.
4764232	4767593	Wasting time on issues that really don't need to be even focused on.
4768093	4777975	The rest of the issue, too, is that while there are rules protecting minors from sexual imagery, there's not too many about violence.
4779769	4782991	The way that I see that is, again, it's scapegoatism.
4783372	4787635	Easy target, let's put everything on the video games and absolve the parents of their responsibility.
4787815	4788895	Exactly, that's all it is.
4788975	4792918	Because if the parents aren't going to be responsible, then the government's got to be responsible for the kids, right?
4794039	4795660	Because that's the stance that they want to take.
4795860	4799042	I think it's absolutely stupid that they're going to have laws.
4799062	4799642	They're even going to...
4800883	4809750	Really, I think it might be a way to generate some revenue for the states or whatever, just so they can find these people and make some extra money.
4810491	4819298	Maybe that's why they're driven to do this, but I don't see... I think it's really up to the parent to decide what's appropriate for their children.
4819318	4819558	Agreed.
4819578	4822561	If they want to play violent video games, then that's fine.
4823061	4825703	Halo, an M-rated game, I don't think that's really that bad.
4825763	4826044	I think a...
4827965	4833472	Adolescent kid can handle that kind of stuff because it's really sci-fi.
4833512	4839719	Now, Manhunt or something like that, that's a little different, but it's all what you decide is appropriate for your child.
4840520	4848048	I know I've brought this up before, but have you seen that episode in Season 7 of Bullshit where they talked about video games and they had you-know-who
4848889	4849289	DarkSakura,
4867518	4883199	and they take the kid out to go shoot an actual gun a real gun his mom's there they've got cops there everything's cool kid shot the gun once and didn't want to touch it again and it had him reduced to tears so
4885154	4888038	Clearly, there is a difference.
4888198	4897409	You know, if you play a game, you know, a violent game on the TV or even a little gun game on the TV versus shooting an actual firearm.
4898290	4899892	I've gotten into a similar thing on this show.
4899932	4904237	You know, I enjoy the occasional, you know, Quake, Unreal Tournament and shooting game.
4904597	4906779	But I don't like guns at all.
4906899	4908460	I don't ever want one in my house.
4908701	4910342	I'm against them for me.
4911123	4912263	I realize there's a second amendment.
4912284	4913665	If other people want to have them, that's their right.
4913725	4917007	But for me, I hate guns, like real ones.
4917388	4918649	But I like gun games.
4919790	4920931	But see, it's totally...
4922612	4924694	It doesn't teach you how to kill people.
4925135	4925615	No, it doesn't.
4925815	4934524	If anything, it teaches you maybe tactics and stuff like that, but in the end, it doesn't teach you how to actually fire the weapon or use the weapon or anything like that.
4934764	4938828	And the human mind is going to be far more creative than an AI in a game would be.
4939489	4941591	Let me get to our chatroom, chat.orange.com.
4941631	4945194	Frisbee wants to know, California residents, when does Arnold leave the governor's seat?
4945574	4946395	January, I believe.
4946715	4950499	And ironically enough, just a couple days after this is heard is the election.
4951520	4958646	And it's past the primaries, and it's down to the Meg Whitman's, the former CEO of eBay.
4958726	4959546	She's the Republican.
4959887	4963970	And then you have Jerry Brown, who was the governor of California in the late 70s, early 80s.
4965771	4969813	But because term limits didn't go in until after he was in office, he's able to run again.
4970173	4971654	So it's a very interesting matchup.
4972094	4972895	Very interesting.
4973875	4975056	And neither one I like.
4975676	4977597	That's the way a lot of people in this state feel.
4977857	4983199	I hate her a lot just because of her campaign right now because it's just smear, smear, smear, smear, smear.
4984400	4986981	For a lot of people I talk to, it's who do you dislike less.
4988266	4997676	I've made up my mind but I'm also a one issue kind of person and both candidates have made it pretty clear where they stand on the issue so I know where I'm voting.
4999422	5003444	my absentee ballot should be coming before too long are you voting for Bill the Cat?
5004925	5018370	no but keep in mind that I vote absentee every time I vote so that I can make a photocopy of my vote and then mail in my original so that it can't be tampered with but that's me
5020972	5042689	Well, the other thing I was going to say, too, in response to the whole violent video game things, and we've also brought this up, too, is that the rate of violence has gone down in minors since, or at least gun-related violence, I think, or armed violence has gone down since 1991, you know, when the Nintendo popped up.
5044050	5057399	Another thing too, and this just has to go to guns in general, is I think that a lack of exposure opens up the door, I think, for putting people in danger.
5059560	5068266	Because it's actually a proven statistic that in those gun-free zones, you know what I'm talking about, that the rate of gun-related violence is higher.
5069186	5072869	Because anyone... People always want what they can't have?
5073655	5074196	DarkSakura.com
5083835	5084675	who won't be armed.
5084876	5085596	They won't be armed.
5086436	5087397	It makes people a target.
5088117	5094780	If you know in a place you're going to go somewhere where you've got a likely chance that they're going to be following the rules there, you've got an easy target.
5095901	5105345	It's the states where people are allowed to carry firearms on them that they have the lowest amount because an armed society is a polite society.
5106146	5108367	These are related, trust me.
5109427	5109627	But
5111608	5119555	If you can establish this difference, make them something that someone's exposed to and say, hey, this is a dangerous object.
5119675	5120976	You shouldn't be using this.
5121476	5123138	This is not the same thing as this.
5123198	5132486	When you give them item A and item B to compare, then I think that that level of exposure is going to put it in pretty early.
5133046	5134687	Oh, well, this is not reality.
5134948	5136529	I don't have to be afraid of this.
5137470	5137950	You know what I mean?
5139211	5145722	And I know a lot of people can distinguish between what's real and what's not real, even kids, and I think a lot of times they just...
5147731	5148492	That's what they blame.
5148792	5151935	If they're not blaming video games for violence, they're blaming guns for violence.
5152935	5166486	The problem is, no one's ever calling these people out and saying, especially these court cases, they go, oh, the video game made me do it, and the judge just doesn't go, take some goddamn responsibility for yourself.
5166527	5171811	There's a few that have been thrown out, actually, lately, because they chalked it up to parental negligence.
5172614	5177797	It'll be interesting to see how the Supreme Court goes on this one though because it definitely will set a precedent, if nothing else.
5178513	5190260	Well, and though they're going to have to go by previous precedent set, like what was that public decency thing that ended up being a free speech?
5190581	5198986	You know, there was in Florida, there's a boob march every year, and it's allowed to go through as freedom of expression.
5199847	5203049	If we can have boobs flapping around in humidity...
5203989	5205551	I think that we can have a little... Wet boobs?
5206311	5209454	I think we can have a little headshot, don't you think?
5210715	5214138	I support this and I think that this should expand across the country.
5215459	5216160	I support this.
5216200	5216440	I agree.
5216460	5217721	Loki's like, why are we talking about games?
5217761	5219062	Let's talk more about the boob march.
5219503	5222926	It was something having to do with people who, you know, were...
5224651	5225091	DarkSakura.com
5248985	5250045	I just don't want to see your boobies.
5250846	5254327	That's why they make shawls and covers.
5255507	5256107	I'm being difficult.
5256167	5256948	No, no, I want to see.
5257808	5258268	Whatever.
5258468	5259348	I don't need to go in there.
5259548	5260929	She's just like, I don't want to show you anyway.
5261289	5261609	All right.
5262129	5263010	My boobs are epic.
5263570	5264170	Moving on.
5265310	5266711	We've got a lot of show in the interest of time.
5266731	5267971	We've got to get on release dates.
5268011	5271732	Let's talk about what violent games are coming to a store near you this week.
5272533	5273013	Start with the U.S.
5273233	5274853	Not really many violent games this week.
5275173	5276474	And it's not too much.
5277294	5278035	of a release week.
5278475	5281698	It is going to start ramping up though very soon, but there are some decent things.
5282058	5291025	There's a re-release of Battlefield Bad Company 2, the Ultimate Edition with some download content there for both Battlefield Bad Company 2 and Battlefield 1943 in there as well.
5292546	5295268	Valkyria Chronicles 2 on the PSP.
5296249	5299652	Gunblade New York City and LA Machine Guns on the Wii this week.
5301193	5303875	Metroid Other M on the Wii this week, which is
5304655	5332348	awesome Camp Rock the final jam on the DS tying in with the movie that's coming out and I hope they really do mean final because I don't care for those Camp Rock games or anything with Disney as far as our TV shows go Guilty Party on the Wii it wants to be Clue but it's just not Prison Tycoon Alcatraz I think a lot of this stuff was delayed from last week because I remember reading a bunch of this
5333396	5340060	The Mumbo Jumbo Six Pack Second Edition with a bunch of different Mumbo Jumbo puzzle and card games in there as well.
5341180	5349885	And what probably is going to be a really shitty game, We Wish You a Merry Christmas for the Wii.
5351346	5352907	It's fucking August.
5353027	5358710	I think that's a re-release because honestly, yeah, it is a re-release and it's $10 now.
5359170	5360371	And trust me, it's not worth $10.
5362372	5362912	That is it.
5363152	5364393	Next week will be some good stuff though.
5365333	5367754	Let's go over to Japan and check out what's coming out over there.
5368174	5370735	A lot of price reductions this week on the Xbox.
5370815	5377738	Left 4 Dead 2, Halo 3 ODST, Modern Warfare 2, and Bayonetta all going into the Platinum Collection over there in Japan.
5378058	5380399	And those are really the only releases to look forward to this week.
5380459	5386441	It's kind of a similar situation where we're just kind of waiting for the big rush at the end of the year which will start any day now.
5387121	5398432	Moving on to the PlayStation 3, same thing, lots of price reductions, but that includes NBA Live 10, Need for Speed Shift, FIFA Soccer 10, World Class Soccer, Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2, and Bayonetta.
5398873	5399694	That's on the PlayStation 3.
5399934	5403778	Again, these are Japanese releases or price reductions as the case may be.
5404378	5406219	as things move into the Platinum Series over there.
5407179	5411080	Looking at the Nintendo Wii, big releases over there this week.
5411120	5415781	Just Metroid Other M gets its release on September 2nd, so it's coming out over there this week as well.
5415801	5419002	They didn't really get it earlier or later, just a couple days later, I guess, if you want to be technical.
5419762	5421523	PlayStation 2 doesn't have a whole lot going on.
5421563	5429745	There is a new FIFA Soccer 10 coming out there, and Shin Sangoku Musou 5 Special gets a price reduction, if you're into that.
5430225	5430905	Cthulhu Saves the World Xbox 360
5449953	5458322	There are so many things wrong with that because Cthulhu never really saves anything unless it's saving by cleansing all humanity off of the world.
5459984	5461766	But maybe that's coming out on 360 this week.
5462066	5463507	Maybe an Xbox Live Arcade game.
5463988	5464328	I don't know.
5464528	5464849	Who knows?
5465189	5466010	But that's an awesome name.
5466971	5467211	All right.
5467251	5471976	Also in Japan this week on the Nintendo DS, a game called Nintama Rantaru.
5473103	5475766	Gakunen Taikosuen Puzzle No Dawn
5489640	5505993	then lastly going on to the Sony PSP and seeing if anything is coming out over there worth mentioning Bleach, Heat the Soul 7 because you know you've missed your Bleach games so there's another one coming out on PSP this week also a game called White Breath Perfect Edition comes out this week as well on the PSP
5507494	5508634	It's called White Breath.
5509675	5511196	It is an adventure game.
5512036	5513977	Trying to figure out if it's a dating sim or what.
5514017	5520240	It's another one of those kind of like read and respond to the characters as they're talking to you.
5520260	5521921	There's so many Japanese games that look like this.
5522342	5522882	But you can choose.
5522942	5524082	It looks like there's a music mode.
5524102	5525763	There's a music song called Slapstick.
5526444	5526924	Yeah, whatever.
5526964	5527324	There you go.
5527364	5528745	Those are your releases in Japan this week.
5529039	5529659	How about Europe?
5530600	5532161	We do have some goodies in Europe.
5532481	5538645	On the 31st, Bioshock 2 Minerva's Den on PS3, PC, Xbox 360.
5539486	5542187	Dead Rising 2 Case Zero on Xbox 360.
5543288	5550633	On September 3rd we have Metroid Other M and Tom Clancy's Hawk 2 and Valkyria Chronicles.
5551473	5554095	So that's going to be a week of excitement.
5555999	5559871	Alright, just a few more news stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week.
5562020	5562420	All right.
5563561	5564041	Let's see.
5564101	5565582	There's some other cool stuff here.
5566582	5567283	It's interesting.
5567323	5576307	This week there was a lot of talk about used game stuff, despite the fact THQ thinks you're all cheaters for buying used games.
5576387	5582250	But apparently some of their direct customers are going to be cheaters as well.
5583351	5585912	Target is actually buying used games.
5585952	5587993	They started their used game buying program.
5589133	5597118	It's actually kind of taking place right now in Northern California, but they're going to be rolling out 850 stores by the year's end.
5597839	5602121	I'm not really sure how that program works, but that'll be interesting.
5604796	5605516	Best Buy Best Buy
5623261	5627584	Well, now they've actually begun doing used game trade-ins as well.
5628204	5634348	And they also have, I guess, $20 gift cards for select titles.
5634608	5642773	If you, you know, buy or trade in a certain game, they'll give you $20, I guess, addition.
5644194	5649858	And, oh, I guess they'll give you $20 instead of the title's trade-in value.
5649998	5651999	But, hey, $20 for games sometimes is pretty good.
5654368	5681276	and um so yeah it's interesting so I'm sure if these guys you know start doing this that probably other retailers especially if they're successful with it will won't be too far behind and then everybody will be cheaters and what will you think then THQ I think they'll probably poop themselves uh anybody planning to take advantage of these programs
5682523	5683603	No, not really.
5711448	5712089	Episode 2, Two Households
5729858	5739501	They're saying it will have better pathfinding, the option to switch between extended and short narration, a new walking animation, more subtitle options, and widescreen support.
5739881	5743122	So I guess it sounds like they've taken a lot of feedback from the first game and implemented it.
5743162	5743802	So that's really cool.
5744682	5754085	In a related story, the website GOG.com, G-O-G.com or goodoldgames.com, they're having a Keen's Quest 1 through 3 bundle selling right now for $9.99.
5755185	5756586	There's also a pack with 4, 5, and 6 bundles.
5757566	5758346	with the same price.
5758366	5759887	You ever looked at GOG.com?
5759927	5772994	They actually have quite a few old, old games for sale on there and a good way to get legitimate what I've seen called abandonware before when people just put up old games because they say it's old and no one cares about it anymore.
5773014	5774235	As long as it's not Game.com.
5775755	5776296	No, it's not that.
5776316	5778577	I had one of those and the taco and got rid of them both.
5779295	5780196	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5801144	5801764	DarkSakura.com
5833567	5835228	This is the theme music from the game.
5835609	5835889	Okay.
5836149	5838031	Now, play the theme music from the anime.
5838551	5839812	Play the theme music from the anime.
5839913	5840453	I can do that.
5840473	5840993	Okay.
5841013	5843075	Because I'm prepared here for a change.
5848580	5851102	That's actually one of the best qualities I have that I can play into.
5854805	5855966	Now, does the gun look familiar?
5856247	5857268	Yes, the gun does look familiar.
5857308	5857468	Wow.
5857488	5858769	You can link that in the chat room.
5859009	5860010	Sure, I'll link this in the chat room.
5860450	5860711	Okay.
5860731	5860811	Okay.
5861733	5866776	The game and the anime Zillion came out as companions to each other.
5866797	5870219	I'm going to switch and do some play of the game.
5870259	5871280	Sorry, didn't mean to cut you off.
5871420	5873361	That's cool.
5873981	5882347	Game actually in Japan, its full name is Akai Kodan Zillion, which is Red Photon Zillion.
5883148	5885689	And it kind of is Metroid-ish.
5885909	5887871	It came out though before then, I believe.
5888551	5891732	It was out in 1987 for the Sega Master System.
5892632	5895473	And there was a sequel called Zillion 2, The Triformation.
5897674	5901936	It also had things in common with Impossible Mission, too.
5902436	5911759	Basically, the general story, you play a group called the White Knights, and you have to go get rid of this base on Planet X. So you play...
5912419	5916183	Main dude, JJ, and you rescue Apple and Champ, who are the other guys.
5916543	5917844	Keep in mind, early anime.
5918625	5923269	Just real quick, don't want to cut you off, but since you brought it up, August 6th, 86 was Metroid.
5923529	5924650	Okay, so then it was afterwards.
5925351	5925611	All right.
5927896	5939229	Anyway, you have to go past tripwires, turrets, forcefields, a bunch of enemy guards, including in some places they kind of run in like Metal Gear style.
5939750	5942933	You hear the little alert noise.
5943494	5944015	So it's pretty cool.
5944475	5944535	J.J.
5944555	5945976	is like a nice balance in between them.
5967931	5979036	There's also a glitch in the game that you can become invincible by dying when you go into a room-to-room elevator, but you can't go to your status menu.
5980397	5983118	The only way you can switch characters is when you find a new teammate.
5983678	5992122	And of course, remember this is the Master System, it is kind of inconvenient to go pause your game on the system like it was back in the day.
5993223	5993323	Um...
5995684	6004771	But the music is, of course, a lot the same music from the anime.
6005152	6010416	And the one where you go in and out of their main ship, it plays the opening theme from the anime.
6011177	6013498	And it plays it when the Sega label goes off.
6013959	6014339	And then...
6015940	6016461	It's pretty cool.
6016481	6020863	It's got a soundtrack called Akai Kodanzillion Let It Rock, which I have.
6021643	6022264	Just saying.
6023444	6024965	And the anime's pretty good, too, actually.
6025585	6038632	But the game is... It's got a lot of different special messages in it, and you have... The way that you go through those rooms is that you have these little pods that you have to blow up and get a character out of, and then you input them into a computer.
6038652	6040793	And the characters don't have to be in any particular order, by the way.
6042975	6049781	and then you'll get like some special codes that will summon, you know, will turn off the tripwires or something and they do other stuff.
6050581	6052603	This more reminds me of Impossible Mission.
6052623	6054024	That's what I said earlier.
6054064	6056446	I said that it has a lot in common with Impossible Mission.
6056466	6058107	Yeah, yeah.
6058408	6059849	Just having looked at this for a little bit now, yeah.
6061387	6065668	But keep in mind, this is a pretty, pretty sweet game.
6065888	6068929	And it doesn't have a save function, sadly.
6069429	6074010	Dan left his game paused while he was playing it for hours on end so he could do other stuff.
6075331	6080112	But I'd have to say it's among the list of, you know, one of my favorites.
6080152	6084073	And also keep in mind, there's a little guest star in Zillion.
6085273	6086314	There's the Opa Opa.
6087194	6087494	Really?
6087514	6087594	Yeah.
6088294	6097459	When you're... Because you can shoot different of those little, you know, pods and get power-ups and one of your power-ups is an OPA-OPA and it gives you a level up.
6099780	6101561	And it's just a little icon of an OPA-OPA.
6105062	6106483	Well, I think this is alternate audio.
6106503	6107343	I don't think that's actually the game.
6107383	6109024	Yeah, that one, if this one I'm thinking of, that is.
6109344	6112626	They said they unsynced and had to use different music.
6112926	6113166	Dope.
6113726	6114187	But yeah, um...
6117648	6121170	If you watch the anime too, there's little scenes where the Opa Opa is hanging out with them.
6122611	6124452	Some little references.
6124652	6125413	Fantasy Zone.
6125473	6125773	Awesome.
6126193	6129095	And of course we know what Fantasy Zone also had to do with.
6129955	6130836	Space Harrier.
6131837	6133758	Maybe we should have Seven Degrees of Space Harrier.
6134458	6135439	Could be a new game to play.
6135719	6135939	Yeah.
6136179	6136860	Alright, well there it is.
6136880	6138020	Your classic game of the week.
6138220	6140102	Zillion for the Sega Master System.
6140602	6141182	Go play it.
6141282	6141763	It's fun.
6142043	6142343	Alright.
6143833	6147594	We'll see what she picks next week because you still get one for the marathon show.
6147935	6149175	Then we might have to actually play it.
6149475	6150215	I think we should.
6150495	6150876	We'll see.
6151176	6153536	I'm going to dig into the closet and go obscure.
6153556	6154377	It better not suck.
6154397	6155617	That's all I'm saying.
6156597	6156898	All right.
6157558	6159498	We're going to take a quick break here at Orange Laundry.
6159558	6162519	Just for that, I'm going to make Rob play through Bungaio by himself on one man.
6162639	6162940	Why?
6163000	6163740	Why would you do that?
6165428	6168390	Alright, we're going to take a quick break here at Orange Lounge Radio, but don't go anywhere.
6168430	6170991	We will be right back with plenty more news stories.
6171511	6174093	We've got your Twitter topics coming too, so make sure you get those in on Twitter.
6174413	6178855	Your emails and phone calls all when we get back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
6185515	6188137	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.
6188197	6191540	We are taping live on this Sunday evening, August the 29th of 2010.
6192080	6199806	It is the 379th episode of our show and lots of folks in our chatroom talking about the upcoming marathon last week.
6200106	6206691	Some folks asking, Robert M is asking in chat, any chance of the marathon being on the podcast or would there be licensed music being used?
6207612	6210013	Right now I don't see why it wouldn't be podcast.
6210033	6213216	I mean I guess it depends on what happens and the legality of what happens.
6213896	6215216	But I don't see why not.
6215276	6221678	It will probably be labeled separately so that those folks, you know, because not everybody's going to want to hear it because it's going to have a different flow.
6222178	6228840	It's not going to be as, dare I say it, polished as this show is, which you know is going to be really bad.
6229560	6233621	But, you know, I'm going to label it differently, but it'll be there, I mean, for folks to download.
6233681	6239983	But those folks that aren't really interested in the excess will be able to just get the regular three-hour show and move on with it.
6241035	6265719	But yeah, that's what we're aiming for right now anyway We'll let you know for sure, of course, after we tape next week Anyhow, we've got more news to get into And of course we're going to get your Twitter topics here in just a minute And the FUs of the week, the mailbag, all those fun segments Phone calls coming up too But first, quick, quick, quick news There's just so much to talk about this week We just don't have time to spend 10 minutes on everything But Loki, what do we want to talk about quickly?
6266581	6268623	This is Vegas is apparently cancelled.
6268683	6273366	It was a game that was being developed by Surreal Software for Midway.
6273386	6277589	But of course when Midway closed down it was then bought up by Warner Brothers Interactive.
6278130	6280211	The premise of the game was retarded as it was.
6280371	6286336	It's basically you going to Vegas, dancing, driving fast cars, punching people, and gambling.
6287056	6291259	And apparently the game is rumored to have cost $43 million to make.
6294028	6295889	Wow, what a waste of money that was.
6296469	6299431	But no confirmation whether it's coming.
6299851	6302393	It's actually canceled or not, but who gives a crap?
6303193	6305154	What are you talking about?
6305174	6306895	That's what I do every time I go visit Tiara.
6308096	6308536	Exactly.
6309877	6312858	Why would you want to play a game that do that?
6313198	6314479	I just don't understand.
6314819	6322744	The Homebrew Channel, it's been something that's been kind of a staple of the homebrew community on the Wii.
6323624	6336204	for quite a while now since the release of homebrew channel version 1.07 they have added anonymous user statistics to the homebrew channel
6339353	6361492	And apparently they have detected about 200,000 people using the homebrew channel on the Wii So that's kind of cool And unsurprisingly I guess the top country using this would be the USA Followed by France, Germany, Spain, and the Great Britain Um
6364182	6373231	and it's interesting though that with that many systems out there there's not really a lot of people that use kind of the homebrew channel for stuff.
6373871	6381638	So maybe the hacking and piracy stuff on the Wii isn't as prevalent as they think it is.
6382319	6386263	Of course there's other methods for that but it's interesting nonetheless.
6387584	6389526	And then finally a unique...
6390715	6391355	MMO Dead State
6407211	6415195	And I guess that developer is composed of Bethesda and Troika vets.
6416396	6422219	They've come up with this new RPG set in a fictional town called Splendid, Texas.
6423019	6451927	and which is in the middle of the grips I guess in the grips of a full on zombie apocalypse and the object is the keep yourself alive and I guess you operate out of a local school which serves as a hub and sanctuary from the horrors of the community and from there you must head out into the wild hunting down supplies and other survivors and of course using those resources to beef up your base there
6452667	6475239	and of course there's tons of zombies and not everybody that you find will be friendly or sane for that matter and combat is supposed to be turn based and you'll be able to issue commands to whole groups or individuals as well so that's supposed to be headed out on a PC sometime I guess relatively soon
6476400	6479403	Taking a step backward here real quick in chat, but it's a good chat comment.
6479644	6489255	TigerClaw in our chat says, and those who pirate games, some people have been playing Metroid Other M on JustinTV, and I noticed one playing a pirated version that was loaded from the Homebrew channel.
6490496	6491257	I'm sure there are.
6491317	6494902	It's been leaked out since last week, so I wouldn't be surprised.
6495563	6495863	Yikes.
6496464	6499048	Alright, well, moving on to some other quick news here.
6499228	6502112	I'm talking about another game coming out from Sony.
6502753	6504395	It's up on PlayStation Japan.
6504495	6512266	There's apparently a teaser page, and on this page you see this Japanese guy sitting in a tuxedo, and it looks like he's knitting.
6513255	6514695	It looks like the Godfather.
6514996	6521397	It is what it looks like, but it's on PlayStation Japan, and EA owns the rights to Godfather, but the Godfather is knitting.
6523078	6524258	It's for LittleBigPlanet 2.
6525158	6525558	You think?
6525998	6527539	No, it's been confirmed that's what it's for.
6527599	6528379	Interesting.
6528399	6531320	Because he's crocheting a sack boy.
6532140	6536481	But it's just funny, because if you actually go to the page, there's an animation of him crocheting.
6536701	6537001	Cute.
6537602	6537802	Yes.
6537982	6538642	All right, I get it.
6538682	6539102	That's funny.
6539542	6542384	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6565026	6569871	Also, the theme song to Zombies is now available on Rock Band Network.
6570872	6576198	Also, if that wasn't enough, you're soon going to be able to get Zombies shirts and Hot Topic.
6577018	6579301	Because you know Hot Topic loves to get in on that trendy stuff.
6580062	6581043	And I love this shirt here.
6581063	6582604	It just says, Zombies!
6582885	6585407	With a big exclamation, exclamation, one.
6585988	6586368	There you go.
6589913	6592935	Also, real quickly, some music game news updates.
6593035	6596396	Beatmania 2DX18 called Resort Anthem.
6596456	6597077	I know, right?
6597117	6598337	I'm like, wow, they got far.
6598377	6599478	It doesn't matter what it's called.
6599498	6600638	2DX Sports Resort.
6601299	6603260	It'll always be 18th style to me.
6603640	6605401	But Resort Anthem has a release date.
6605421	6606321	It's September 15th.
6606941	6607342	There you go.
6607442	6609923	And all those no arcades, it'll import that here in the U.S.
6610526	6615789	And then lastly, DDRX2 is going to be location tested very soon in Joy-Z.
6616970	6618490	I don't have the specifics on where.
6618651	6620191	I'm hoping somebody in our chatroom can fill me in.
6620231	6622553	Unfortunately, my little newsy link is... Oh, there we go.
6622733	6624214	On the border with lots of skee-ball.
6624354	6625735	It wasn't working a minute ago.
6625835	6629577	No, it actually is going to be at Funplex in East Hanover, New Jersey.
6630357	6630957	That's where it's at.
6632538	6635020	Enjoy if you live in Joy-Z or nearby.
6636060	6637721	Go play some X2 and let us know what you think.
6638101	6638582	Dark Sakura.
6639491	6641292	I got your news right here.
6642752	6649935	Well, there's a rumor going that for Marvel vs. Capcom 3 that Crimson Viper is going to be a character in it.
6651635	6660439	But I think it's looking at this outline and the way that they have it done on the site that I think it's actually very likely Crimson Viper.
6660519	6664640	They just masked her out and showed the silhouette and it fits perfectly.
6665521	6665661	And
6666981	6671026	So, um, I don't, she's cheap.
6671126	6672227	Why put her in the game?
6672507	6673829	Why do people hate her so much?
6673869	6677233	I was reading the comments on that site and there's a lot of hate for Crimson Viper.
6677253	6678234	She's a cheap whore?
6678915	6681217	Well, a lot of characters in Street Fighter are cheap whores.
6681237	6682158	That's what that game's all about.
6682178	6683360	She's a masher's paradise?
6684269	6685070	Sounds good to me.
6685390	6686651	She's Eddie Gordo.
6687511	6689633	I used to love Eddie Gordo in Tekken 3.
6690213	6690653	Mash her.
6690753	6691194	And what?
6691374	6691774	And what?
6691914	6698599	So what are you going to do when you have, you know, Tekken versus Street Fighter or whatever, and you can do Eddie Gordo versus Crimson Viper?
6698619	6699899	Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.
6699940	6700480	What he said.
6702681	6704362	It's like, mash, mash, mash, mash, switch.
6704443	6705683	Mash, mash, mash, mash, switch.
6708505	6710426	All the buttons on my controller break within a week.
6710607	6711487	How'd this happen?
6713108	6714029	What'd you do that for?
6714929	6716950	Well, how about something for a different game?
6717030	6719191	I don't know when I started talking in LeetSpeak.
6719231	6720232	How does it happen?
6721092	6722072	Crackdown 2, Rob.
6722172	6722813	Crackdown 2.
6723413	6723853	A.K.A.
6724273	6725094	I don't know.
6725414	6726754	I like jumping the sequel.
6729055	6732177	Basically, the new download content is going to be...
6733897	6736078	It's called Toy Box.
6737019	6748143	And there's a free version that will have one called Keys to the City, which is an unlock, and the Thruster ability, which is jetpacks for your boot and vehicle tag.
6748743	6757667	And then if you pay the 560 Microsoft points, then you'll get 5 new weapons, 2 new vehicles, a couple avatar items, 10 new Chivos.
6758707	6761208	So, according to this, I guess that means achievement, huh?
6762888	6763969	I think that's a stupid word.
6764029	6766129	It makes me think of Cheetos and now I want some.
6768550	6774131	Why have Cheetos when you can have those knock-off Cheetos that are like the cheesy poofs?
6775291	6776071	Cheese puffs.
6776611	6778412	They sell them in big old bags at Trader Joe's.
6778852	6781832	They're still cheesy but they're more puffy.
6782713	6784453	They make me more puffy when I eat them.
6784813	6785493	How about something else?
6785953	6786414	How about it?
6787574	6787934	Oh, wait, wait.
6787954	6788775	I want to say real quick.
6789495	6805801	If Microsoft knew what they were doing, they would release download content for, I don't know, 400 points, 800 points that would allow you to go into the arena with the announcer and flamethrower him to death and then he'll talk and announce about how he's dying and why would you want to kill me?
6807045	6810766	I've got a wife and family, peacekeeper, or whatever, agent.
6812727	6814227	You can bite my butt, boss.
6816528	6816788	Anyway.
6816848	6818148	It's Robert Stack, okay?
6818188	6826950	They somehow have downloaded his consciousness into the game, and that's who I picture talking to me, and it makes me all warm and fuzzy inside.
6826970	6829231	Yeah, but you say Robert Stack, and I think Ultra Magnus.
6830865	6833427	Because Transformers the movie was awesome.
6833667	6834488	Not the new ones!
6834768	6836049	The old school, animated.
6836649	6836929	Anyway.
6837810	6838991	But we need sad music, Rob.
6839071	6840071	We need really sad music.
6841773	6842233	Okay, hold on.
6842273	6843394	Let me get you some sad music.
6843494	6845135	Or maybe like some Sanctus or something.
6845155	6846576	Can you fill time while I get you sad music?
6847397	6851339	Well, I know this is supposed to be like a little quick segment.
6851399	6853481	Hold on, hold on.
6853501	6854322	Here's your sad music.
6856403	6857164	Come on, work.
6857364	6857684	Okay, wait.
6861661	6865222	Oh wait, sorry, I got the B-52's Funplex.
6865422	6868243	I was thinking Funplex earlier, I know.
6868323	6870384	I got the song for the other story mixed up.
6870704	6871504	Oh well, make it work.
6871524	6873244	You can just play this.
6875465	6881007	We have to say rest in peace to a company who has brought us a bunch of games.
6881727	6884548	They brought us Space Jam.
6886929	6888169	They brought us Burnout.
6891115	6891955	by Acclaim.
6893276	6896137	Acclaim is going down.
6897397	6898377	I thought they'd been down for a while.
6898457	6899538	They're really down now.
6904619	6905380	It's just gone.
6911061	6913722	Rob, you are a sick puppy.
6916023	6916803	Sick puppy!
6918424	6918964	Sorry, Acclaim.
6920259	6930652	Well, yeah, basically the deal is that Howard Marks bought the name and tried to reboot it as a free-to-play games portal.
6931053	6931613	It was terrible.
6932094	6933876	Yeah, and crash and burn.
6934597	6936139	I think you can go to the site and get refunds.
6937501	6937761	Anyway.
6939571	6941573	What was the last big thing Acclaim did?
6941713	6944535	I haven't seen that name since, gosh.
6945436	6947438	Welcome to NBA Jam.
6947458	6948358	Didn't they do Double Dragon?
6948458	6948899	Okay, NBA Jam.
6948919	6951281	I was going to say Double Dragon 2 on the NES, I think was them.
6952362	6952582	Yeah.
6952882	6962630	Well, NBA Jam, though, the last system that was out was, and I think it was, other than download versions, they did one on the PlayStation.
6963611	6964071	Well, they did.
6964291	6964632	You're right.
6964972	6968415	Yeah, that we've been looking for that isn't the other version.
6968666	6969806	Thank you, Ranma.
6969906	6971667	Acclaim did BMX XXX.
6971747	6972788	That was Acclaim.
6973368	6975769	I think that was the first foot in the grave.
6975829	6978210	What a fine piece of gaming history that game is.
6979030	6979790	I guess it was Acclaim.
6980470	6982591	It was a fun game, okay?
6983652	6984252	It was fun.
6985092	6986293	Alright, let's move on, guys.
6986333	6988493	It was kind of cool dragging a hoe around on your bike.
6989814	6990854	As in a BMX bike.
6993015	6995336	Wow, let's get into some Twitter topics.
6999179	7000220	Twitter.com slash OLR
7015198	7016779	DJ Blaze Quinn is announcing this.
7017480	7020862	I read this earlier in the week and I think this is worth reading.
7021263	7027847	G4 has announced, according to DJ Blaze Quinn here in this news story, a new show called Bomb Patrol Afghanistan.
7028488	7029168	Have you heard about this?
7029228	7033992	This is the show on G4, which I don't know why we're reporting on this on the show.
7034012	7037074	I think we banned G4 news from the show a while ago, but oh well, moment of weakness.
7037654	7039395	They've made a show out of the Hurt Locker.
7040155	7041355	Yeah, the one that won the Oscar.
7041835	7044696	Yeah, apparently it is Bomb Patrol Afghanistan.
7044756	7052058	It's a new series about real-life soldiers who put their lives on the line every day as members of the Explosive Ordnance Disposal.
7052538	7056539	The show will follow the lives of the EOD team, both at home and in Afghanistan.
7057060	7057400	You know what?
7057420	7061021	All things considered, I don't think it sounds like a bad show.
7061101	7063521	It's just basically a documentary-ish type of show.
7063581	7065422	I mean, it's not like they're voting people out or...
7067256	7071059	You get voted out of Afghanistan!
7071279	7073561	Sweet!
7074202	7075983	I'm sorry, we're sending you home.
7076323	7077284	You know why this is news?
7078085	7080026	It's an interesting show on G4.
7080527	7082809	But I really don't understand the Hurt Locker connection.
7082829	7086091	I think I would watch it.
7086552	7087893	It made that subject...
7089886	7091827	Put that subject in the public eye, if you will.
7092507	7093708	And this is just furthering that.
7093768	7094308	So, I don't know.
7094328	7095949	I don't necessarily see it as bad news.
7095989	7100531	It's just not gaming, but how long has G4 not been gaming for?
7100951	7102552	I'll tell you, a really long time.
7104133	7113457	By the way, also, in somewhat related-ish news, EA is standing by their... Again, this is from a tweet from DJ Blaziken.
7114117	7118120	Each EA is standing by Medal of Honor's choice to include the Taliban.
7118920	7123524	Let's see, a comment here from British Defense Secretary Liam Fox, who criticized the game.
7123584	7127426	Quote, "...at the hands of the Taliban, children have lost fathers and wives have lost husbands.
7127746	7132530	It's shocking that someone would think it is acceptable to recreate the acts of the Taliban and British soldiers.
7132970	7137673	It's hard to believe any citizen of our country would wish to buy such a thoroughly un-British game.
7138074	7142917	I would urge retailers to show their support for our armed forces and ban this tasteless product."
7143417	7152668	Ooh, EA standing by it saying, it is a creative risk, but they are not going to let the protesters, quote, compromise our creative vision and what we want to do.
7154470	7155531	If you don't like it, don't buy it.
7156733	7157213	Sounds good to me.
7158335	7159336	Going back to the tweets.
7162058	7164199	DarkKisuke says, talk about Reach.
7183294	7193247	I don't know, Halo 3 just kind of, it wasn't as, plus the group I used to play with, a bunch of college buddies, like a bunch of them had babies and stuff and they don't want to play video games online anymore.
7194970	7195531	So there you go.
7196474	7198655	I don't really... I kind of lost interest in the Halo series.
7198975	7199755	I'll check it out.
7200035	7201596	If somebody I know buys it, I'll look.
7202216	7203336	Is Dan getting Halo Reach?
7203517	7204817	You guys probably aren't getting it, huh?
7205377	7206518	That depends.
7207738	7209239	Yeah, he'll probably get Halo Reach.
7209939	7211699	I'm sure it's a popular game.
7212300	7212600	We'll see.
7214662	7216764	TigerClaw305 sends us some links.
7218126	7222230	Real quickly, a Wii balance board used to create a motorized baby buggy.
7222470	7223431	That's awesome.
7223752	7224613	How does that work?
7224913	7229959	It's basically, it's a toddler that can't really, or not even toddler, an infant that can't walk yet.
7230259	7230960	Who makes the Skynet?
7252995	7254077	It's a college student.
7254457	7255779	Oh, of course.
7255919	7257081	But it's awfully cute.
7257742	7258062	Alright.
7258943	7260446	Also, another link from Tigerclaw.
7260506	7263530	Lenovo developing a motion control console for China.
7264491	7264771	Hmm.
7265673	7266774	I guess it's called the E-Box?
7267575	7271298	The console will also focus less on violence and more on family entertainment.
7290134	7292159	Well, as does the Kinect.
7293381	7293622	Oops.
7294344	7297050	I swear I didn't plan that song to come on, but it's kind of funny in retrospect.
7297451	7297671	More tweets.
7302338	7303498	Maybe this will be the last one here.
7303738	7305559	Oh, no, there's a couple here.
7305879	7307899	DarkKeysK gets another one in here.
7308639	7312140	Maxis Dark Spore, a Diablo-style action RPG.
7313040	7314200	I don't know much about Dark Spore.
7314220	7315440	Is this a game you know a little more about?
7315760	7316721	It's a combination.
7316781	7320741	It's basically like Spore, but set in a Diablo-type gameplay.
7320801	7323342	So you create your character, and it's a hack-and-slash game.
7323422	7324362	Oh, that sounds kind of cool.
7324522	7326402	Maxis is the folks that made Spore, after all.
7326422	7327302	They also made The Sims.
7327963	7330503	They've been around a while, because that's basically Will Wright's studio, isn't it?
7330843	7335487	Actdeft is linking us to a story Xplay gave Metroid Other M a 2 out of 5 says no need to watch the video
7360559	7367405	Um, that's some intern at the station trying to keep X-Play relevant by causing a little controversy, I'm sure.
7367505	7367905	No, I don't know.
7367945	7369327	Maybe the game is terrible.
7369387	7369747	I don't know.
7370087	7371328	It didn't get terrible reviews.
7371348	7372469	I think it looks pretty good.
7372489	7378775	I think what people didn't like was how sometimes it would switch between the first person and third person view.
7379335	7384800	Just if you happen to, like, move the controller off the screen, it would just all of a sudden switch back, and that kind of sucked.
7385560	7390945	and also the fact that you couldn't basically run around in the first person mode so people had gripes about that.
7390965	7396069	Probably because they've been playing Metroid Prime for a while but whatever, it looks kind of cool.
7397971	7399952	I'll just go on record and say fuck X-Play.
7400953	7401914	Lastly, Sterlok.
7402955	7406398	Pokemon Black and White are the fastest selling DS games in history.
7406458	7407559	Well, there's a big surprise.
7408219	7409200	Links us to this article.
7411542	7418926	That does confirm, ever since July 31st, 2010, over a million pre-orders for Pokemon Black and White version were taken.
7418966	7423689	That's 1.08 pre-orders for this game launching September 18th, 2010.
7424109	7430052	And so Nintendo is saying that it's going to make Pokemon Black and White the fastest selling DS games ever.
7431153	7433414	See, that's cheating though, because there's two different games there.
7434355	7435455	But they counted as one.
7435836	7436576	That's fuzzy math.
7438143	7440645	Whatever, I guess everybody lets him get away with it because it's Pokemans.
7442707	7447391	TigerClaw wants to point out that Metroid Other M has an 81 on Metacritic.
7448111	7451094	So that 2 out of 5 seems to be a little bit out of place.
7453056	7453316	Anyhow.
7454082	7456083	Let's move on to some other gaming news.
7456223	7459205	If you want to send us some tweets for next week, twitter.com slash olr.
7479496	7486460	and, of course, as not a big surprise, Microsoft saying, oh, we're going to ban everybody that's playing Reach.
7486560	7490882	Well, first off, if you're dumb enough to play online with Reach, then yes, you should be banned anyways.
7491462	7494924	I'm assuming that this is also considering people that...
7495524	7517774	Aren't necessarily playing online, but say people that have a JTAG console or something, and have an account that they use for live, and maybe move their account back and forth on a memory unit or something like that, and it would show in your recently played games or something like that, or if you get achievements before the release date, and then they can check out whether you have a modded console or something like that.
7517934	7521316	So, if you don't want to get banned...
7522679	7527362	Just don't play with a profile that you use online until it's launched.
7528283	7532906	And they claim, though, that they can tell the difference between this and with the full version.
7533126	7538410	But, you know, if you're really that scared about it, you can always re-download it when it gets leaked out from the disc.
7538530	7540431	So, I don't know.
7540651	7544294	But, yeah, so they're threatening to ban people, as they probably would.
7545314	7546775	This doesn't come as a big surprise, though.
7546795	7547195	No, not at all.
7547215	7549237	I mean, they always want to ban people who are playing the game.
7549317	7550918	Of course, they don't want to say, well...
7551810	7554731	Oh darn, I guess there's nothing we can do about it.
7554791	7555372	Steal away.
7555412	7556652	I mean, they're not going to say that.
7556672	7559774	They're going to be like, we're going to come to your house and set you on fire.
7559894	7562975	I mean, that's the kind of threats that they should be making.
7562995	7564416	We will destroy you.
7564436	7568118	If we could make your Xbox do other ring colors, we would.
7568278	7571579	Your console will get set on fire and burn down your house and kill your cat.
7571639	7572180	That's right.
7574381	7576602	I don't know, Shermie's very well insulated.
7577631	7578813	That would be funny, though.
7579274	7581899	They have robot legs built into it.
7581939	7584845	It just gets up, walks out, and goes back to Microsoft.
7584945	7587130	Now that's a show I want to see on G4.
7587250	7588452	Cat vs. Xbox.
7591058	7592259	We've had that in my house.
7592599	7592919	Have you?
7593359	7594079	You know what it was?
7594399	7594619	What?
7594820	7597721	Jamie taking the vacuum to the Xbox to get the cat hair out of it.
7599041	7599261	Nice.
7599502	7600062	Cat wins.
7600102	7602303	Maybe the cat was laying on top of it because it's warm.
7602343	7603343	You know that happens quite a bit.
7603863	7607385	Shermie... It would be too much effort for Shermie to get on top of it.
7607405	7608025	I'll put it that way.
7608125	7611266	My cat loves my Xbox 360, especially in the winter.
7611306	7612247	She'll lay behind it.
7612927	7618929	but she'll lay so close to it that there's no air flow so I don't really appreciate that too much but she will lay next to it.
7618969	7619690	That and the computer.
7619730	7621871	She loves all the hot air being blown out.
7621931	7622451	They're warm.
7623031	7623351	Exactly.
7623631	7628173	Or she'll lay on power supplies you know like those big old transformers because they're super hot.
7628473	7632275	She's just like laying her head right on them like Katie you're going to electrocute yourself or something.
7632295	7634996	You know what your cat needs is like an electric blanket or some other source.
7635016	7635456	No she doesn't.
7635496	7641779	You know what I got for Shermie is this mat that redistributes their own heat and warms the whole thing.
7642739	7644119	and she loves it and it was like 10 bucks.
7644179	7651561	She has her little baby bed that she lays in still even though she's like way bigger than it but you know she's spoiled and she doesn't need anything.
7651901	7652642	Kitten mittens.
7654002	7656503	Does your cat make too much noise?
7657223	7658323	Mittens made out of kittens?
7658363	7659763	Well we got plenty of kittens to do that.
7662204	7662524	Alright.
7662584	7664204	Speaking of which, does anyone want a kitten?
7664345	7666005	I mean because I've got like tons of them.
7666505	7667286	They're overrunning my backyard.
7667306	7669769	What are you going to do if somebody in New York is like, yes, I want a cat?
7669869	7672291	I will put it in a box and ship it UPS.
7672331	7673152	No, no, just kidding.
7673513	7675074	I will not do that because that's cruel.
7675935	7677677	We'll ship it FedEx.
7678898	7682422	Obviously, I can't get you a cat unless you actually drive all the way out here.
7682742	7684983	Heart8 in our chatroom suggests a cat Snuggie.
7685303	7685984	I like that idea.
7686024	7689305	But, unfortunately, you will have to come and... It's kind of like pick and pull.
7689466	7691867	You will have to pick and pull your own cat out of the backyard.
7694588	7696089	I can't provide that service for you.
7696569	7702672	There's only one cat that will actually... There's one of the cats that will actually get very paralyzed with fear.
7702892	7704933	And that's the only cat that I can actually pick up out there.
7705654	7707795	Because it'll just kind of freeze up and I just...
7708496	7708696	Scoop.
7708896	7709437	Scoop it right up.
7726918	7730800	Alan showed me a video this week that makes me want a dog.
7731060	7731780	Like, seriously.
7731800	7734821	Because this is the cutest dog I've ever seen in my life.
7734841	7735522	Okay?
7735742	7737002	And you know what type of dog it is?
7737503	7738263	It's a corgi.
7738683	7739563	I love corgis!
7740344	7743885	And the video, if you want to look this up on YouTube, is called Corgi Flop.
7744526	7747267	And it's the most adorable thing I've ever seen in my entire life.
7747327	7749048	So, like, there's this little dog that goes in.
7749348	7750288	And then they got... Oh, wait, wait, wait.
7750388	7751429	Oh, where's the corgi?
7751449	7751669	Corgi!
7751689	7753209	Okay, so the dog and the person jump in.
7753610	7754450	There goes the corgi.
7754470	7754570	Corgi.
7755111	7756234	Hold on.
7756695	7762730	The corgi, like, watches for a minute, and then the corgi just, at some point, the corgi goes, come on, come on, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it.
7765489	7766970	Thanks for watching!
7790143	7792983	Let me link that in our chat room there, because I apologize.
7793004	7796824	That makes for terrible radio, but I had to derail the show and just tell you about my experience.
7797764	7798404	That's a big deal.
7798464	7800905	For me to say I want a dog is a huge deal.
7800965	7802305	Ask somebody who's known me for years and years.
7802625	7807986	DarkSakura, me saying I want a dog, that's like call hell and ask if they've got ice cream.
7808506	7811507	Really, yeah.
7811587	7815287	It's like going into Rob's bedroom and finding an AK under his bed.
7816628	7817068	Pretty much.
7817528	7819308	All right, anyhow, let's move on.
7820469	7821090	8-Hour-a-Week Limit
7838368	7839709	Yes, that's right.
7840210	7850499	What's happening is that apparently in Final Fantasy XIV, once you've played a particular job class for 8 hours, the amount of experience you start to earn decreases.
7851040	7854103	And once you've played for 15 hours, you're done.
7854623	7856625	You can't earn any more experience.
7857285	7860428	This is the reverse of what other games like World of Warcraft do.
7860448	7861709	Wait, is it just one job class?
7861749	7863351	Can you switch classes to something else?
7863471	7864832	Yes, apparently you can.
7864852	7869456	But that's like, you know, if you remember Final Fantasy XI, that's practically like doing a whole different character.
7869816	7870496	Completely different.
7870777	7872999	Here's a quote real quick about why this system is in place.
7873359	7873599	Quote,
7881986	7887910	Furthermore, it is being designed to not give those with more time on their hands to play an unfair advantage.
7893840	7894981	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7913838	7915959	Just up in arms about this.
7916039	7917961	Like, on the website going crazy.
7918021	7919982	Like, you guys have got to be kidding me.
7920283	7922665	Who are you to tell me how long I can be playing these games?
7923926	7924606	It's my money.
7925006	7933213	There's another thing, though, to consider is that if it's also on a per-character basis, it also sort of balances out the leveling.
7934374	7937616	I mean, what's the word I'm thinking of?
7937676	7939098	The hierarchy of levels?
7939118	7939638	Yeah.
7939818	7944080	to where you're not going to have a week later maxed out characters.
7944800	7960227	You're going to have people to really follow the incentive that are going to be on a more even par so people move up together and then they can start putting out content later on for those people who hit those higher levels.
7960447	7961048	Does that make sense?
7962128	7962568	A little bit.
7963069	7968391	Now, there was a translation that came out on the North American website that helped her try to bring some clarity to this.
7968811	7969872	It's very lengthy.
7970352	7971753	Let me try to give you the bullet points here.
7972473	7977075	We calculated a value for the amount of skill or experience points that could be earned in a one-hour period.
7977375	7989301	This theoretical value represents an hour spent engaged solely in combat, left quests, or any other activities that earn skill or experience points and sets a threshold to delimiting how many of these points can be earned in a period of play.
7989861	8016153	based on this we have implemented a threshold value concept these thresholds are regulated by a one week timer that begins counting down the instant you earn experience points after a week has passed the thresholds will reset and the moment skill experience points are earned again the timer begins counting down anew for the first eight thresholds during this week long period players will receive skill or experience points at the maximum rate and then it goes on after that and then eventually reaches a rate of zero
8016673	8024695	It is worth noting, however, that the reduced rate will also gradually recover while players are engaged in activities that do not yield skill or experience points.
8025096	8030917	In this manner, it is possible for the threshold value to reset completely even before the completion of the one-week timer.
8032418	8042781	So in a nutshell, this is very convoluted, but those of you that just plan to take three days off work and play Final Fantasy XIV non-stop when this comes out are going to be hitting this wall.
8043154	8058936	yeah but now they're talking about stuff that doesn't require skills so say for example I go and fight fight fight fight fight and then burn out the whole thing then I can go craft and that will kind of build it back I mean I could spend a bunch of time like making food or something I don't know
8061221	8062061	It's interesting.
8062121	8063002	I mean, it's their game.
8063022	8064782	They can do what they want, but let me go back.
8065283	8067003	I've played the Final Fantasy XIV beta.
8067163	8069164	It stinks, and I'm sorry.
8069304	8071465	I don't think they made a quick game at all.
8073146	8075447	It's harder, at least in the beta I played.
8076107	8078428	Again, it's been a couple months, or maybe a month.
8079028	8080049	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8100387	8112887	for me, that's where the weirdness is of this is that they swear up and down they want to make this more casual MMO and something you don't have to spend all this time playing but it just seems like the game itself is still Final Fantasy XI upgraded you know what I mean?
8113688	8114229	so, I don't know
8116109	8116649	That'd be weird.
8117250	8119972	Bonds in our chatroom says, good thing Warcraft does not do that.
8120232	8123034	Well, if you think about it, though, they do, in a way.
8123294	8124375	They just do the reverse.
8124995	8131020	You get rewarded with double XP for the time you aren't playing and logged out consecutively on a character.
8131440	8134122	And that's to help you catch up so that people can't get too far ahead.
8134582	8137384	So it's just like, it's more of a reward than a penalty.
8137424	8140166	And I think that seems to be where a lot of people are up in arms.
8140786	8140907	So...
8141927	8144308	Ziba in our chatroom says Guild Wars 2 all the way.
8144628	8149129	You know, I saw a video of Guild Wars 2 gameplay and I gotta say it looks pretty hot.
8149509	8151210	It looks very action oriented.
8151250	8153810	Let me see if I can find that same video here.
8154130	8155131	Another quick YouTube.
8156411	8159612	Have either of you guys heard anything about Guild Wars 2 or seen any of this?
8160732	8160972	Nope.
8161652	8164633	I kind of got out of the Guild Wars thing.
8164653	8165674	This is so different.
8166074	8166534	Oh, here it is.
8166654	8169915	I think this is out of Gamescom.
8169955	8170895	Yeah, there we go.
8173143	8173423	DarkSakura
8199540	8206103	Well, in other stuff, we do have... Now, this is not just gaming related.
8206163	8214567	This is archaeology and anthropology and prehistoric biology.
8215567	8216788	So, like Indiana Jones?
8218934	8220054	Laura Croft, Tomb Raider
8239663	8248451	They found a type of turtle, a Maolinid, I believe is how it's said, that evolved 50 million years ago.
8250092	8256819	But now the funny thing about it is that when you look at it face on, it looks like King Koopa.
8258377	8263378	Seriously, it's got the same facial shape.
8264979	8268779	And I'm not saying the old school Koopa, I'm saying the modern incarnation.
8270280	8272620	It's got that flat head and the horns.
8272640	8273380	What are you talking about?
8273400	8274981	That thing looks nothing like Dennis Hopper.
8276441	8276761	Get it?
8277081	8278321	Yes, I get it.
8279282	8281702	I know it's too soon, but they're both dead!
8281722	8282242	Wah wah.
8285283	8288946	I'm going to actually link the story into the chatroom because this is actually pretty cool.
8289286	8291167	I'd like to see what our chatroom thinks about this.
8291307	8292308	A quick wire in.
8292588	8293369	You know what it looks like?
8293469	8296190	It looks like, oh God, what the hell is his name?
8296451	8297651	It looks fat is what it looks like.
8297791	8301034	The big old turtle from Final Fantasy?
8301054	8303195	Oh, I know what you're talking about.
8303215	8303655	Yes, yes.
8303796	8304696	I know exactly what you're talking about.
8304716	8305397	I forget the name too.
8306838	8309960	Now, here's the question that's burning on my mind, DarkSakura.
8310020	8313302	Was it a Koopa Troopa or a Para Koopa Troopa?
8313462	8314303	It's a King Koopa.
8314503	8314863	Oh, I see.
8315863	8316984	Seriously, look at that head.
8318004	8319145	That's an ugly sumbitch.
8320845	8324667	Well, maybe it's... And Ranma in chat says, Zach, it's my ex-girlfriend.
8326348	8327488	You dated a turtle?
8327968	8328889	God, you're dumb.
8333298	8334539	I like following all the links on here.
8334559	8336381	What kind of weird kinky shit are you into?
8336461	8342386	Is it possible that Miyamoto just got inspiration from books on the Galapagos Islands or something?
8343187	8344068	It could be.
8344108	8346349	I think we're reading way too much into this.
8346450	8347110	Yeah, I think you're right.
8347130	8352495	I mean, after all, it's the turtle that decided to evolve into something that would become a video game.
8352575	8353195	That's why.
8353335	8356958	You know, we are thinking way too hard on this, and Loki, I demand a story about porn.
8357739	8358279	Help me out here.
8358739	8359740	A story about porn.
8360100	8360980	Well, you know what?
8361160	8374204	I think I can kind of help you out because Playboy is teaming up with Big Point to form a new game label because they had some really awesome games that came out way back in the day, I guess.
8374405	8378506	Now this isn't about porn because you know you only subscribe to Playboy for the articles.
8382891	8393496	Um, anyways, they're teaming up with Big Point, uh, which is currently working on, I guess, the Battlestar Galactica online game, not having to do with porn, and, uh, other free, uh, to play games on its own web portal.
8393716	8398818	And it says, uh, Playboy will now also distribute, uh, through its own domain some, uh, free-to-play games.
8399399	8403200	Uh, the first game to get the Red Cartman treatment is Poisonville.
8403901	8406362	I wonder if this is like Farmville, but with poison.
8409143	8410784	Link is probably not safe for work.
8410924	8411444	Let's check it out.
8437114	8439876	And the video's not playing, so I can only assume that there's no boobs.
8440236	8442358	And I am very disappointed by that.
8443939	8449262	Although I do have to say, though, in the background they have Pam Anderson from Miss February 1990.
8449883	8451324	And she looks quite different now.
8454184	8454484	DarkSakura.com
8480940	8482741	Oh, she's making out with some dude.
8483041	8484562	Oh, and she stole his car.
8487724	8488925	Now that sounds like a game, Jamie.
8489025	8492587	It's like they do a GTA game starring a badass chick.
8492827	8493967	Well, that's what it seems like so far.
8493987	8495188	Yeah, I'll play that.
8497149	8500451	And she's going into the ghetto.
8500791	8501772	There's all sorts of guys.
8501972	8505934	There's a guy that just did a roundhouse kick into a windshield and broke the windshield.
8506454	8507555	That's really excessive.
8509096	8529515	and now she's teaming up with some really weird looking bikers it's a bunch of like really kind of girl powered chicks with assault rifles so if you imagine like a Saints Row why is Playboy making this girl Saints Row or APB with like you know lots of chicks and ski masks look look I don't mean to sound like sexist or whatever but why is Playboy
8530356	8532458	The home of women exploitation.
8532978	8537582	Making this game that's now like, hey, the girl's in charge.
8537702	8538943	I'm Angelina Jolie.
8539003	8541525	I'm making out and stealing cars and all this stuff.
8541585	8543247	Like, I don't get it.
8543967	8544788	It looks neat.
8544908	8549152	I mean, if it's free to play, I might check it out because, you know, it's kind of cool looking.
8549772	8553855	But that's the trailer, which I'm sure has nothing to do with the actual gameplay of the game.
8554816	8559240	And I gotta say, with a game that's, you know, on Playboy.com, um...
8560874	8561315	Poisonville.com
8575774	8581276	Let's see, Toa Gak in our chatroom says, GTA, girl take all your shit, in parentheses.
8581336	8582456	Nah, he's trying, he's trying.
8582616	8583817	You need a better acronym than that.
8583937	8585897	Oh, they've got the beta.
8586157	8588778	You can try this free to play right now.
8589379	8590739	Someone sounds like an infomercial.
8590759	8591859	Are you on Playboy's payroll?
8592019	8592520	No, I'm on...
8593820	8595521	I'm on the Poisonville website.
8595582	8600205	But I gotta say, though, I'm looking at all these different screenshots.
8600225	8603748	The screenshots look pretty good, but the game has no nudity.
8604309	8607811	Therefore, it does not need to be on this website.
8607891	8617099	Now, if it's Playboy Mansion, the game, you know, where it's like, you know, kind of an adult version of Charlie's Angels where Hef is Charlie.
8620061	8622263	The girls next door of the game would be great.
8622745	8623766	Hello, angels.
8624026	8625686	I need you to pleasure me today.
8626907	8628488	That's how I kind of picture that game.
8628988	8631089	I just want a decent game with boobies.
8631189	8632250	Is that too much to ask?
8633470	8634451	Besides God of War.
8635591	8635831	All right.
8636392	8636912	Moving on.
8637552	8638293	Let's talk about...
8639235	8639956	Atari 2600 Sword Quest, Tempest,
8662672	8669995	Outlaw, Dodgem, Real Sports Football, Starship, and basically all the same shit you see in Game Room, right?
8670015	8675157	And then there's some arcade hits, including Pong and Lunar Lander and Missile Command and all this.
8675838	8681560	I guess the one neat thing about this game, it is a $30 cartridge, so you're kind of like, oh boy, what do I care?
8681920	8685042	The one neat thing about this game is that it does have something Game Room doesn't have.
8685482	8688063	Single cartridge multiplayer games.
8688183	8689143	Thank you for watching!
8710573	8711113	I don't know.
8712073	8718695	We got our retro fix with Game Room, and if they would just add multiplayer, maybe it would be better, and so on and so forth.
8719215	8719715	There you go.
8721515	8722716	Hey, how about the mailbag?
8722816	8734898	Let's go to our mailbag at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com Every week, DarkSakura dives into the mailbag head first, picks out a couple emails that she thinks are worthy of being read on the show, and then she reads them.
8735978	8736519	I do.
8736699	8737199	You do.
8738039	8738699	So, DarkSakura.
8739594	8743497	Well, first of all, I delete any email that's full of stupidity.
8744258	8744898	Good for you!
8746119	8751543	So let me go on to the first of our beautiful, gorgeous, fantastical emails.
8753164	8753985	I'll start with a shorty.
8755066	8756087	Greetings, OLR crew.
8756127	8757207	It's been a while, hasn't it?
8757948	8759409	Just want to say that I love the show.
8759589	8762772	Also, I saw Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, and it's now my new favorite movie.
8763152	8765354	The video game references are hilarious.
8765994	8769395	The Gay Roommate is hilarious, and so are the seven evil exes.
8769875	8773656	I'm going to buy the book so I can see the backstory, and I'm going to buy the game also.
8774096	8775456	So keep up the good work, OLR.
8775656	8777316	Love, Geekboy2424.
8777516	8777836	P.S.
8778297	8783278	Those of you who get the reference from K-On, I give OLR a moi moi heart cannon.
8784638	8784998	Wow.
8786818	8787318	Well, thanks.
8787578	8788479	I'm glad you liked the movie.
8788519	8793560	I didn't think it was the best movie ever, but it tickled the retro funny bone, I suppose.
8794260	8795000	You know, all that stuff.
8796411	8796771	There you go.
8797991	8798912	Next one from Troy.
8799312	8799772	Hi.
8800652	8804913	Okay, apparently he sent two, so I'm going to actually go to the, see if I can find the first one.
8805913	8806733	Okay, maybe not.
8807413	8808514	I'll just go ahead and read this one.
8810174	8813555	Sorry for the double email, but I thought this was funny.
8813595	8817856	Apparently you can buy Halo Reach early for 99,999 Microsoft points.
8820662	8823143	Oh, somebody didn't listen to last week's show yet when they sent the email.
8823743	8824103	Yeah.
8824143	8825864	Talked all about it on last week's show.
8825964	8827304	And no, you can't.
8828545	8829685	It's much cheaper than that now.
8830726	8830966	Is it?
8831506	8832326	Yeah, free.
8834567	8835347	True, true.
8836067	8838928	But you might get banned according to an article earlier in the show.
8839349	8840189	This one's for me.
8841348	8848055	Hey OLR, I'm writing in with a food-related question.
8848115	8849616	It's labeled Orange Lounge Foodio.
8850737	8853960	Food-related question specifically for Jamie.
8854321	8858024	Apologies for sending this to the show inbox, but I couldn't find a way of contacting her personally.
8858144	8858485	Wow.
8859305	8862188	Well, I'll go ahead and read it.
8862208	8863950	We haven't had a good food derailing yet.
8864562	8865082	DarkSakura.com
8887020	8889542	I've been including foods such as salmon, beef, and oats into my diet.
8889722	8892263	Anything with healthy fats and proteins will be appreciated as well.
8892884	8893944	Thank you so much in advance.
8893964	8895405	I love the show and keep up the good work.
8895465	8899448	I'm not going to read the person's name, but I'm sure the person knows who it is.
8899868	8902490	Well, you're going to want to eat fried chicken and pizza.
8902510	8902810	No, Rob.
8903350	8905172	It's gaining... That's how I gain weight.
8905232	8909094	The way that my uncle did it is he ate a lot of tuna.
8909274	8911616	A lot of tuna.
8913457	8914297	You can also...
8916672	8923359	Keep in mind, I'm going more towards the opposite direction, towards the lean tissue, the losing side.
8924740	8930185	But you can eat... Tempeh is really good to get your protein from if you want a vegetarian source.
8932427	8935730	Tofu... Beefcake 3000.
8937557	8938298	Beefcake!
8939239	8948470	If you're trying to go the real food route, I know that the way that my uncle did it is that also instead of sucrose, he used fructose as his sweetener because it's a more complex sugar.
8949271	8953316	More whole wheat type stuff, but I'd say lots of fish.
8953796	8954237	Lots of fish.
8954257	8954818	Go get sushi.
8954838	8956420	A lot of sashimi.
8957200	8959861	and you know, I don't know if you've got a Fuddruckers where you are.
8960301	8962101	I haven't seen them out in that area but maybe they do.
8962442	8964162	They have elk burgers and they're super good.
8964182	8968923	You can get elk and game meat like you can get venison at some grocery stores.
8969503	8970504	You can probably go hunting for it.
8971004	8972504	I should put out this disclaimer.
8972564	8974705	Jamie's not a doctor and neither am I. I am not.
8975145	8979166	And you really should, if you want to make sure you're doing it the right way, be under a doctor's care.
8979426	8981248	That's what I was going to say, Rob.
8981288	8982009	I'm just saying.
8982289	8983631	I was going to say it.
8983691	8984652	I just don't want to get sued.
8985453	8986313	I'm not a doctor.
8986914	8988556	I'm telling you what I've read.
8988896	8990077	She plays one on the internet.
8992080	8992780	Dr. Sakura.
8992960	8993101	No.
8993321	8994682	She's played a lot of Trauma Center.
8995563	8995904	Shut up.
8997826	8998987	Don't make me break out the Vuvuzela.
9001084	9007149	Anyway, I'm really, I'm just passing on to you what I've observed, what I've seen other people do.
9007449	9016976	Really the best thing to do, which is what I was getting to before Rob stood on the soapbox, is talk to your nutritionist.
9017216	9018117	Find a nutritionist.
9018857	9019658	Do some research.
9021039	9024221	I'll email you back with some of my own happenings.
9025542	9028164	I'll make sure that you get my contact information.
9028785	9028945	But...
9030339	9038406	but yeah, I mean, and of course make sure that you do not slack off on the exercise change your routine
9039651	9041952	Unless your goal is to get a bigger butt.
9042772	9054417	A trainer that I talked to just the other day actually said that if you start hitting a rut in your, like your, and I was kind of actually, I was thinking about this too because I used to do this with DDR.
9055377	9055577	Okay.
9056797	9065961	Is that if you feel something getting too easy and you know, you can change it up, do something that's harder because that's how you challenge yourself, right?
9065981	9066081	Right.
9066621	9076329	Well, someone was bringing it up at the gym just the other day and I was hearing him talk about it and I guess the same thing would apply, you know.
9077410	9079552	I'm not a fitness coach.
9080233	9084036	And if all you really want is a bigger butt, DarkSakura was looking at some stuff before the show.
9084056	9085357	Booty pop panties.
9085557	9086598	Just look them up.
9086718	9087879	Booty pop panties.
9088640	9090241	They're $20 panties.
9091182	9092043	They give you a bigger butt.
9092614	9095756	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9117069	9119591	Second, about the marathon show, I'd be up for it.
9119671	9122953	I haven't been able to listen live for a while because of school and working on my book.
9123273	9125674	But the concept of a marathon show intrigues me.
9126075	9129697	Just think of all the loopy, incoherent chatter we could deliver around 8 a.m.
9129897	9132198	It'll be like the old school DDR tournament shows.
9132679	9134420	If you want to hear some real train wreck radio...
9135160	9136981	Go look at like the go try to find the show.
9137001	9142543	I don't even know if it was recorded at B3 where we did like we had to do like 20 hours of programming across two days.
9142583	9143223	It was crazy.
9143363	9146865	And it's or my favorite as well was the shaft that we did.
9147425	9150466	Yes, it was called Sacramento hosts another fabulous tournament.
9151586	9152707	Oh, that's what we said it was.
9152927	9153107	Yes.
9153707	9176450	Uh, that's, that was hosted at Scandia, and I just remember, like, I was emceeing the, the DDR freestyle, and at certain points, I'd look over, and there was one point where it just looked like Loki was bambling, rambling incoherently into the microphone, like, I don't even know what he was saying, and then at one point, Jahi, God, I love that guy, I don't know where he, where he's at these days, but Jahi, like, I remember looking over, and he had the mic just by himself, and he was just doing, like, this, right?
9177310	9183033	Like yelling into the microphone, it seemed like I'm like, who's listening to him right now?
9183133	9183894	Poor people.
9184374	9184954	I love Jahi.
9185174	9186075	Oh yeah, good times.
9186735	9191057	By the way, just a note for anyone who owns an iPad, buy a Bluetooth wireless keyboard.
9191738	9199622	It is a better keyboard than the virtual keyboard on the iPad, doesn't move out of place like the keyboard that hooks into the iPad dock, and can be found online for 40 bucks.
9199762	9200842	Again, I own an iPad.
9202663	9204925	That's the face he made, the P. So it...
9206065	9207265	Staycare Redertainment.
9207786	9210866	This message has been brought to you by the Black Robin Christmas Carol.
9211047	9212587	Insert self-indulgent plug here.
9212927	9213787	Sent from my iPad.
9213867	9214167	Ha!
9215968	9216848	Last email, Rob?
9217548	9218429	No, actually we got two.
9219189	9220429	Oh, here's the other part from Troy.
9220489	9220769	Sorry.
9221189	9222050	Hey there, OLR.
9222210	9226771	I don't entirely know if you guys know how to love a cat or even if you have a pet, but you should watch this.
9229136	9231157	Oh, it's 100 Ways to Love a Cat.
9232578	9233179	I'll watch it later.
9233199	9234279	I'll watch it later.
9234379	9234900	I have a cat.
9234980	9235600	I have a Shermie.
9236260	9237481	She likes to be loved with food.
9241584	9242664	Okay, here's the last one.
9242805	9243785	Hi, OLR folks.
9244325	9244626	Hi.
9246387	9246687	Rob.
9246987	9247147	What?
9247187	9248228	I'm going to respond back.
9248248	9249629	If they say hi, I've got to say hi back.
9249669	9250389	I don't want to be rude.
9250609	9251510	Hi, OLR folks.
9251550	9254232	There was something that a friend of mine said to me that really bothered me.
9254612	9256033	He said I wasn't a hardcore gamer.
9256573	9259254	I was quite hurt by that because I always thought I was a hardcore gamer.
9259274	9262795	I have a PS3, Wii, DS, First Generation, Dreamcast, Game Boy Color, and N64.
9263175	9263735	I still win.
9264315	9265975	All with their original boxes.
9266635	9277678	I've got figurines from Soul Calibur 2, a resin statue from Space Channel 5, mounds and mounds of video games, sheet music, a few video game reference t-shirts, and even my screensaver and desktop wallpapers are from Echo Chrome and I don't even owe the game.
9278178	9279619	Do you think I'm still a hardcore gamer?
9280619	9280699	Um...
9282333	9283993	Game is what you play, not what you own
9303058	9304419	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9324915	9344161	my friend is constantly trying to get me to play Left 4 Dead and even though I don't have an Xbox 360 nor do I want one the reason I don't want to play it is because I suck at first person shooters and I end up getting killed when I try to fight against more seasoned gamers except for Portal see, your friend's a hater I can't wait for the sequel to come out for the record, sequel is spelled S-E-Q-U-E-L not A-L
9344901	9347703	For the past few years, FPSers have been all the rage.
9348164	9349885	There have been Halo clones left and right.
9349945	9357991	So I guess my question is, does not liking a certain genre that seems to currently be the most popular make you someone less of a gamer?
9358371	9359832	Thank you for reading my email, Stan.
9360773	9361453	No, it doesn't.
9362174	9364916	Your friend is just being a dick.
9365336	9367156	Okay, can I play devil's advocate for a minute?
9367536	9374978	I think everybody in chat is in agreeance that his friend's just being a jerk and a hater, and I think we're all saying that too, but let me ask you this.
9375938	9389260	Using this same logic, is somebody that plays Facebook games and Farmville and Bejeweled Blitz and Imagine Cat Shop and Just Dance, are they a gamer?
9390920	9392201	I don't think Facebook games count.
9393661	9393961	Really?
9393981	9394101	Really?
9394545	9399207	Now, if you're playing Bejeweled on a handheld system, that's a game.
9401027	9403868	See, okay, well, here's the definition.
9403928	9405749	You've got your casual games, right?
9406909	9410411	Which, they're technically, yes, they're games.
9411871	9421514	But I think that the actual definition of gamer as far as what is socially considered a gamer has to do specifically with PC and console games.
9422455	9422735	Not
9424635	9426956	Flash-based games, if you know what I mean.
9427616	9433757	But, like, installing said game on hard drive, playing, you know, against people.
9434697	9438118	The more... The higher intensity stuff.
9438358	9447620	I think multiplayer games, you know, again, installed content, console-type things, yes, those count.
9447820	9448500	That's a gamer.
9448800	9449000	But...
9450061	9468938	if you play mostly puzzlers and things you're going to be looped into that casual category and I think that hardcore if I'm going to even go a bit further into generalizations we're looking at a very um what's the word that I'm thinking of um
9472032	9475033	Gender-related type of theme.
9476434	9480676	I want to try and nail down this definition a lot quicker.
9481536	9485478	I think a gamer is someone who has an appreciation for game culture.
9485878	9487039	It's a gaming enthusiast.
9487619	9492922	If you went to the trouble to download this podcast and email it, you care about games enough.
9493022	9493982	I think you're a gamer.
9495303	9498064	If you have ever bought a gaming magazine off the shelf,
9498544	9500206	You have an interest in gaming culture.
9500226	9501888	We do have non-gamers that listen, by the way.
9503070	9504151	And that's possible, sure.
9504772	9507075	We probably have a lot of food fans at the rate this show is going.
9508477	9516887	If you are somebody who has ever watched a television program about video games because you are interested in the content...
9517888	9519209	You're probably a gamer.
9519830	9523373	I think a gamer is just somebody who has an active interest in gaming culture.
9523713	9535423	And somebody who does Farmville and that's it probably really isn't a gamer because they don't have an interest in the culture of games and why we play them and what motivates us and what keeps our interest.
9535463	9535863	You know what I mean?
9536244	9541228	Well, it's like, you know, the other definition of gamer is, of course, tabletop.
9542970	9548314	But, you know, it's like, I can sit down, when I play Monopoly, am I playing a game?
9548954	9551016	I'm playing as much of a game as I am playing Street Fighter.
9551056	9553017	It's a game, it's for entertainment.
9553618	9555599	But I don't collect Monopoly memorabilia.
9556680	9559662	So, I'm not a board gamer, I guess.
9561163	9569689	That's why I'm trying to look at it is by, and to put it back to this way, it's not what you have, it's what you do with it.
9570750	9571651	Okay, that sounded dirty.
9572365	9593609	um it's the games that you have the games that you enjoy and if you play them all the time that's pretty hardcore you know and if you make it a part of your life I think that may like you were saying if you make it a part of your life then you're a gamer and your friend's a hater and your friend's a hater your friend's just judging you all right
9595601	9605730	And TigerClaw in our chatroom says this If this so-called friend had been saying that, all that Then that is not a friend at all You get the impression that they don't want to be around you Just because you like games that they don't
9607697	9614362	I don't know if it's necessarily that severe, but your friend just kind of, in regards to this topic, needs to pull his head out of his butt.
9614422	9615442	Tiara told me something funny.
9615462	9615823	What's that?
9616823	9620566	If you're playing Monopoly, you may not be a board gamer, you might be a board gamer.
9621807	9622747	Ah, play on words.
9624108	9625830	She's a grammar enthusiast.
9625930	9626210	Alright.
9627491	9627791	Anyhow.
9627831	9630613	I don't know, I get pretty bored once, you know, all the big streets are bought up.
9631033	9631975	Is that it for the mailbag?
9632615	9633597	It's over!
9633657	9637623	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com The mailbag is closed.
9637703	9642770	It's time for us to do a little bit of ranting in a segment we like to call the F-Years of the Week.
9662512	9670734	I have a number of FUs, but one of them is... What was it I was ranting about when you guys came in today?
9671594	9672134	I don't remember.
9672154	9674094	I don't remember.
9675295	9675875	I don't remember.
9677415	9680816	Just... When I came in here, you were talking about those booty shorts.
9682016	9682436	Well, okay.
9682916	9688297	I've got a lot of really good stuff happening to me this week, so I'd say FU to not having enough time.
9690498	9691398	And stupid drivers!
9694088	9699272	I also feel a lack of time, especially since I have to take care of the baby and I don't sleep very much anymore.
9700392	9705496	I go to bed at like 11 and I have to wake up again to feed him.
9705556	9711900	Like last night, I actually was trying to go to bed at like 9 because I anticipate getting up way early in the morning.
9712821	9720466	And so I tried to put him down at 10 and he just kept fussing and would not go to sleep until about midnight.
9724028	9733656	A couple hours and then wake up usually with him around 4 o'clock in the morning or 5 o'clock in the morning, sometimes 6 o'clock in the morning and we're up until I have to go to work.
9734416	9740742	So, you know, multiply that times infinite and it really sucks.
9741302	9745926	But just the lack of time to actually get to work on my Grand Theft Auto mods and stuff like that.
9746526	9749228	and also an FU to just plain shitty drivers.
9749288	9751830	I was behind this old... Well, I thought it was an old man.
9751850	9752931	It ended up being an old woman.
9753352	9758856	But she was obviously lost and didn't know where she was going or she was looking for a turn of some sort.
9759256	9768624	And so she was driving really slow and then finally, it was funny and kind of ironic, blew through a red light and then it got caught by the red light camera.
9768704	9768884	So...
9769805	9771246	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
9791121	9795025	My god, you treat this shit like it's high school with all the fucking drama and stuff.
9795105	9799408	Some people are asking questions and you're like, well, I'm too good to answer your fucking questions.
9800129	9801731	So, you know, fuck them.
9802451	9810438	And fuck you for deleting my post just because I'm explaining how to do things because you want to claim to be the first person that's ever done this thing.
9810478	9813441	Maybe you should stop hanging on web forums with 14 and 15 year old boys.
9814696	9817619	Well, I try not to, but it's very limited.
9818881	9825849	Modding the Xbox 360 version of Grand Theft Auto, it's very limited in the amount of message boards out there for that.
9825889	9831355	Trust me, if there was a different source, a more mature form that I could go to, I would love to be there.
9832156	9832837	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9855158	9862082	You know, we ended up getting rerouted to another flight that was delayed for like three hours and it's kind of like they could have given us a better heads up about the delay.
9862122	9863262	I was a little irritated.
9863802	9865763	Some parts of that situation just seemed preventable.
9866764	9873007	I'm a pretty resilient person and I like to think I was able to let that situation kind of roll off my back as kind of like one of those funny life experiences.
9873447	9879310	But I did feel really bad for my friend who was supposed to be a birthday trip for her and it's just, you know, really bummed out about it and
9880131	9880951	I can understand.
9881232	9882633	Kind of sucks to have that happen.
9883674	9887358	So, just F you to shit happening.
9887879	9889120	Because sometimes it does.
9889621	9890362	Shit happens.
9890962	9892284	There ain't anything you can do about it.
9893485	9895107	Alright, meanwhile, back to the show.
9895427	9897730	Couple news stories for you guys, and then the Skype line!
9898789	9900130	Yes, it's kind of interesting.
9900170	9903892	There is a whole trademark dispute over Mafia Wars.
9904692	9912176	Digital Chocolate is claiming that they had the trademark Mafia Wars for their, I believe, is an iPhone game.
9913276	9921261	And then, of course, Zynga has their Mafia Wars game that came out later on that was on Facebook and PC and whatnot.
9921761	9927924	And, of course, now their Mafia Wars game has all sorts of different marketing with Seven
9928244	9928905	and that kind of stuff.
9929605	9943414	It says the United States Patent and Trademark Office lists Zynga's first filing date for the game under the name Mafia Wars as July 1st 2009 although no filing under that name could be located with Digital Chocolate as the applicant.
9943454	9948677	Digital Chocolate has not responded of course to the request by Joystick in this case.
9949537	9950938	Of course you know it's
9952259	9952699	Settlement Settlement
9975538	9977259	Anyhow, one more story for you guys.
9977299	9979481	I guess I should get that Skype line ready to go, shouldn't I?
9979541	9980522	All right.
9980542	9981643	1-877-GAME-OLR.
9981703	9982724	Username is Skype.
9982744	9983505	If you want to start calling.
9983865	9986868	But meanwhile, I got one more story for you guys.
9986988	9988890	And this is very interesting.
9988930	9990711	And it's one of those things I looked at and I was like, really?
9990772	9991812	Is this real life?
9992013	9992653	I don't even know.
9993534	9993894	What is this?
9993934	9994495	I cannot even.
9995816	9999299	It's a game called The Bible Online.
9999900	10000420	That's right.
10001201	10001761	This is real.
10001841	10013306	It's a game called The Bible Online where you will get to slip into the role of Abraham and his descendants and have the opportunity to reenact and witness the incidents of their times.
10014366	10015807	The game will be split into chapters.
10015907	10017927	The heroes will be the first one that comes out.
10018408	10020588	It's basically an MMO strategy game.
10020628	10021809	You control your own tribe.
10021849	10022629	You build a city.
10022729	10024250	You wage war in the name of God.
10026991	10047683	I see why I mean like this almost sounds like a joke like I just don't even get it but apparently there's a website it's thebible-onlinegame.com complete with side quests, role playing elements and there you go that's what it's all about no word yet if there's gonna be you know other religious texts what?
10049083	10050584	have you actually looked at the screen captures on it?
10051245	10053046	I did it's super dinky
10054697	10056218	I almost think it's not real.
10056478	10057519	No, it is.
10057659	10057979	It's real.
10058219	10059140	There's a beta sign up.
10059240	10060440	It's stinky.
10060520	10064122	It reminds me of a late 90s strategy game.
10064943	10066464	Where's Bibleville?
10067204	10069945	Are they going to have the Koran online?
10070066	10073107	Are they going to be equal opportunity and do a Koran online?
10074368	10074688	No.
10074828	10076769	Just don't put it too close to ground zero.
10079531	10079851	Anyhow.
10081846	10082427	Moving on.
10082827	10083388	Are you making food?
10083408	10084109	Are you making me food?
10084129	10084929	I don't want food.
10084949	10085670	Do you want a taco?
10085730	10086411	I don't want a taco.
10086431	10086671	I'm fine.
10086691	10088053	I've been sitting here hungry.
10088513	10089194	Then make a taco.
10089354	10089995	Watching Loki.
10090055	10090415	I'll eat.
10090495	10090656	Fine.
10090676	10091597	I'll take calls without you.
10092558	10093559	I'll be in here back in a second.
10093579	10094219	I'm also making my taco.
10094239	10095080	Do you want me to make you a taco?
10095221	10096061	No, I don't want a taco.
10096142	10096522	Then fine.
10096602	10097103	I'll be right back.
10097183	10097363	Fine.
10098140	10098560	Taco!
10098701	10099501	Do you want to send Dan in?
10099521	10100622	Maybe Dan wants to talk to some listeners.
10100783	10101964	Dan, you want to talk to some listeners?
10102464	10103946	Let's just have Dan answer the phones tonight.
10104026	10105107	Dan, come answer the phones!
10107829	10109271	He's busy playing something.
10109291	10109771	What's he playing?
10110071	10110352	Do you know?
10110572	10110912	I don't know.
10110992	10111553	Oh, he's coming.
10111573	10112413	What are you playing?
10112454	10112794	Hey, Dan.
10112994	10114255	Dan, you want to answer the phones tonight?
10114816	10115076	Yes.
10115276	10116678	Alright, Skyplane with Dan!
10117358	10120261	Alright, so you're just going to say, Hi, this is Orange Haunts Radio.
10120421	10120821	This is Dan.
10120841	10121262	What do you want?
10121522	10122983	Hey, this is DJ Blaziken This is who?
10123543	10123983	DJ Blaziken
10145438	10147059	DJ Blaziken.
10147279	10148000	Oh, good.
10148901	10149561	Good to hear from you.
10149601	10150142	What's up, man?
10150262	10150802	How you doing?
10151263	10152083	What can we do for you?
10152103	10156787	Not much other than I just got done with a Silent Hill in the dark session.
10158548	10158909	Wow.
10160290	10161511	Creepy as hell.
10161711	10165454	Now the question is, did you have surround sound?
10166795	10171939	I'm playing Homecoming for the 360, and I actually unplugged the 360 audio cables
10172287	10175428	I plugged in my PSP audio cable for the stream.
10176168	10179809	And so basically I'm listening to you guys while playing Silent Hill.
10180650	10185851	Kind of getting rid of some of the creepiness, but monsters coming out of the woodwork out of nowhere.
10186992	10188532	Makes you jump out of a chair.
10188552	10192794	See, that's a giant mistake, because Silent Hill is well known for its incredible sound design.
10193254	10197215	You play that on surround sound system in the dark, it's going to fuck you up for life.
10199503	10202865	Oh, trust me, I've been screwed for life by Silent Hill years ago.
10202885	10204887	Yeah, I trust you, but I don't really want to hear about it.
10206267	10208869	No, no, no, it was back on the old PlayStation 1.
10209029	10211631	I played it probably, I played a demo.
10211851	10213372	Hey, I'm in the middle of a call.
10214493	10221877	The demo of Silent Hill 1 basically creeped me the heck out when I was like 10, okay?
10222458	10222838	Okay.
10223697	10225518	You know, you probably shouldn't have been playing that when you were 10.
10225998	10227879	It must mean your parents don't care about you.
10230019	10230460	I gotta go.
10231260	10232220	I've been kicked out of the room.
10232500	10232881	Alright.
10233621	10235322	It's good to hear from you.
10236182	10236702	Give me that!
10237342	10237863	Stay black.
10238563	10239663	Thanks for the call.
10239783	10240383	Take care.
10241364	10241744	Bye.
10241764	10242424	What the hell?
10242724	10243245	I don't know.
10243345	10243645	Bye.
10243665	10244405	That's my husband.
10244425	10245265	I have to live with this.
10248550	10251213	Did he really just end that call with stay black?
10251393	10261405	I don't even... Did it occur to you that he's not black, Dan?
10263447	10264929	Alright, moving on.
10265109	10265890	Let's take another call.
10265910	10266911	I guess Dan left the room.
10266951	10267552	Let's move on.
10270607	10271788	You're on Orange Launch Radio.
10271828	10272248	Who's this?
10272928	10273809	This is Ranma.
10273829	10276690	I want to know, did you do that on purpose or what?
10276950	10278891	I mean, really, that was just excellent timing.
10278951	10279812	Do what on purpose?
10281273	10282633	Rob, you know exactly what I'm talking about.
10282653	10283694	The whole chat room knows.
10284054	10288316	Oh, no, but I would have closed the phone call with that if you want.
10290117	10295320	Actually, Dan just yelled from the living room, Ranma, stay black.
10296544	10298125	Tell them to stay white.
10299046	10301048	Ranma says to stay white.
10301068	10306171	I didn't think that was something that could be changed very easily unless you're like Ted Danson.
10306211	10308653	I think it has to do with those old 70s movies.
10309474	10313496	Just keep in mind, in the Hebrew Hammer, there's a line, Shlomo, stay Jewish.
10314237	10316579	Once in a while, it's a video game talk show.
10316839	10319201	I don't know if you've played any games this week, Ranma, but...
10320223	10321125	I have.
10322647	10327393	I have been playing Scott Pilgrim vs. the World for the last four to five days.
10327774	10329336	You know, I played the demo actually this week.
10329356	10332621	I didn't talk about it because I got consumed with the Lara Croft game, but what do you think?
10334013	10339559	Anyone that loves River City Ransom, get your ass on Xbox Live or PlayStation Network and get this game.
10339940	10340861	That's it.
10340941	10343043	It's just River City Ransom 2, isn't it?
10343363	10344044	It really is.
10344625	10347508	With all the gaming references, my god.
10347828	10351913	I mean, I'm a type of person where I will play through a game and I'm pretty much done with it.
10351933	10352693	I won't pick it up again.
10354535	10357418	First day, me and my roommate, we finished the game in four and a half hours.
10357618	10360662	A couple of days later, I jump on the game and plow right through it.
10360882	10364465	And I played through the game again last night to like 4.30 in the morning.
10365530	10366530	It's a good time.
10366590	10371532	That's like me on the Lara Croft game, but obviously this is for different reasons.
10371852	10376173	Is it just the nostalgia factor that's getting you, or are you really having fun just kind of button mashing and beating them up?
10376954	10377374	All of that.
10377474	10382495	I mean, hell, I actually went out and bought an arcade fighter joystick just to play this game with.
10382755	10382915	Wow.
10382955	10386056	And I just automatically adjusted to the joystick and played through the game.
10386256	10387417	That is hardcore.
10387957	10388177	Yes.
10388837	10389658	That's awesome.
10389698	10389878	Wow.
10391471	10395213	Tell us a little bit about how the game kind of changes as it progresses.
10395273	10400775	Because something I noticed, like, in the demo I was playing, I was like, okay, well, this is kind of, you know, repetitive.
10400835	10402256	It's button mashing, da-da-da.
10402556	10405737	But then I noticed, like, as you level up, oh, you start getting new moves.
10405817	10409219	And then as you go into the shops, you can kind of enhance the strength and so forth.
10409519	10412340	Does that kind of evolution continue as you move on?
10413121	10414221	Yeah, something like that.
10414301	10420924	Like, as every level goes on, the game gets progressively harder and harder, but you get more coins and more money.
10422319	10422840	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
10441758	10444859	That and I looked at the leaderboards of my friends.
10444959	10450001	I was determined to pretty much get to the top of the ladder out of my friends list, which I did.
10451981	10456523	Last I recall, I'm ranked like 2,200 and everybody else is like in the 4,000s.
10457023	10461004	That still means there's 2,199 people better than you.
10462004	10465285	That means I'm going to have to go through every single one of them to get to the top.
10465505	10466066	That's right.
10466986	10470067	Number one guy has like over $9 million in the game.
10470107	10470547	I'm like, well...
10471351	10473132	I've got my work cut off for myself.
10473372	10476553	It's a good thing he's not playing Final Fantasy XIV or he would have got cut off by now.
10477134	10477474	All right.
10478074	10480735	Any other thoughts for our listeners tonight, Ranma, before I take some more calls?
10481616	10489859	I was going to talk about the whole online passing, but we'll save that for another time because that's like another 10 minutes of me ranting and losing my mind.
10489959	10490239	All right.
10490660	10491220	No problem.
10491580	10494721	I'm sure there'll sadly be more stories on it as we move on.
10494801	10497563	And there's folks asking for your gamer tag in chat, so you might want to share.
10498323	10500305	Oh, I'll type it out in the chat room right now.
10500886	10503148	Alright, well, Ranma, thank you so much for calling in.
10503308	10505730	Have a great week, and of course, stay black, my friend.
10506251	10506711	L'chaim!
10506971	10507832	Alright, take care.
10512797	10514819	Let's go to the phones and take another call.
10514899	10516660	Hi, you're on... I had my mouth full of taco.
10516681	10518322	You had your mouth full... Was that a taco laugh?
10518923	10519783	Alright, I've got another call.
10519823	10520804	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
10520824	10521165	Who's this?
10521946	10522927	Hey, it's Tiara!
10523207	10524528	Tiara, my friend!
10524588	10526269	Long time no chat, how are you?
10526829	10528330	I'm doing very good, how are you?
10528470	10531011	I am great, but I'd be better if I was in Vegas.
10531992	10538956	Oh yeah, and speaking of Vegas, the reason I called is because I have to tell you about the This is Vegas game.
10539616	10546180	The reason that they're not making it anymore is because I had to send out a cease and desist letter because they were copying my life.
10546781	10547021	What?
10547041	10547121	What?
10548211	10556317	Yeah, I mean, I didn't mind, you know, the dancing, the gambling, you know, going out on the strip, but when they got to the part with punching people, I had to draw a line.
10556878	10557418	I see.
10557578	10563443	So, basically, because it was an unauthorized biography of Tiara, you had to cease and desist them.
10564203	10564784	Exactly.
10565304	10567686	Ruining gamer dreams everywhere.
10568246	10568567	I know.
10568627	10571068	I also had to put a stop on Boobville, so that's...
10571809	10572129	DarkSakura.com
10591345	10615795	and I played it and I played it for a while and it was like it sucked up a couple of hours of my life because it's kind of addicting it is very addicting which is weird because it's kind of stupid like I'm playing this game and I'm like this game is so stupid but I keep hoping that I'll get picked to play clock game and then I'm like oh if I get to level five I'll get to unlock a new pricing game and I'm really excited about that why because I'm a sad person you have Plinko
10616676	10617156	Not yet.
10617296	10623678	All I ever see... Well, the game is still in beta, but all I ever see is Clock Game and Safe Crackers.
10624119	10625759	Yeah, I always get Safe Crackers.
10625839	10628220	There's another one you get to unlock at level 5.
10628840	10630921	But I have found that I am a terrible shopper.
10631041	10634102	I have yet to be called up to play a pricing game.
10634502	10638364	But, but, but, this is important, I am an awesome wheel spinner.
10638864	10641205	And I almost always get 95 cents or a dollar.
10641385	10641825	Just saying.
10642862	10643242	Oh, nice.
10643382	10645784	Yeah, I always weigh under bid.
10646484	10658751	The things that they have for bid, it's like nobody's going to pay as much money as the game says, and it seems like it's way more overpriced than the actual Price is Right television show.
10658871	10671598	You just have to remember real people like you and me shop at places like Ikea and Target, and the Price is Right apparently buys all of their stuff at the Galleria, Versace, and all that good stuff.
10672807	10674869	Apparently so, yeah.
10675149	10676911	Anyways, I just wanted to call and say hi.
10677191	10678472	Well, thank you so much for the phone call.
10678492	10681215	I'll tell you the story behind the This is Vegas.
10681575	10682516	Well, I appreciate it.
10682656	10687741	I wish you would stop ruining the dreams of gamers everywhere, but maybe you'll let us have something fun in the future.
10688325	10692247	Well, you guys can come down to Vegas and I'll show you around.
10692287	10696029	You know what I would love to do if I don't have anything else planned this year?
10696169	10698270	I would love to take a Christmas trip to Vegas.
10699010	10700471	Yeah, that would be fun.
10700551	10702972	Christmas ain't no big deal to you anymore, right?
10702992	10704072	Let's go.
10704512	10707274	Depending on if I get a certain house.
10707314	10708354	Oh, I'm shopping for a house.
10708574	10710915	If I get one with an extra bedroom, you could probably even crash.
10710935	10711936	That would be awesome.
10712822	10716865	Oh, yes, and just so the chat knows, yes, Tiara has some type of clicking sound in the background.
10717145	10719987	We'll just say Clicky the pen is trying to infiltrate Orange Lounge Radio.
10720007	10720788	We'll just leave it at that.
10720828	10721628	I don't know what that's all about.
10721648	10722129	Damn, Clicky.
10722349	10722949	Damn, Clicky.
10723410	10724350	It returned.
10724611	10725811	The ghost of Clicky passed.
10725831	10726492	Yeah, I don't know.
10726592	10729834	This mic is very, very crazy with the clicking.
10729934	10731315	Sometimes it comes up.
10731456	10733317	Sometimes it just randomly disappears.
10733637	10741743	I think it's actually the doctor is coming to kidnap me, and it's the sonic screwdriver, but it's malfunctioning, so it makes a clicky noise instead of a... Well, you did get
10741863	10742884	The Giggling Girl comic show again?
10767358	10769659	Yeah, it kind of is, except for there's a dude now.
10769859	10771779	So it's two giggling girls and a dude.
10772059	10772880	A giggling dude.
10773000	10773900	Men ruining everything.
10775440	10776100	Where can I get it?
10776181	10776961	Where can I download it?
10777441	10777781	Is it ready?
10777841	10787284	It's going to be on infamousgamers.com and that's infamous without an I. So N-F-A-M-O-U-S gamers.com N Famous Gamers.
10787744	10788184	Sounds good.
10788979	10789279	All right.
10789840	10791341	Well, Tiara, thanks so much for your call.
10791381	10794223	Good luck with the podcast since DarkSakura's on it.
10794263	10795864	I'm sure it'll be a challenge.
10796105	10797606	But I'm kidding.
10797646	10798366	I'm kidding.
10798767	10801149	Oh, you should see the death stare I just got.
10801189	10801949	It was pretty awesome.
10802089	10803210	You owe me ice cream.
10804471	10805312	I don't eat ice cream.
10805492	10805892	Good luck.
10807253	10807934	There's your ice cream.
10807974	10808274	All right.
10809475	10811217	Tiara, thank you so much for your phone call.
10811577	10812999	Stay black and we'll talk to you next time.
10813499	10813939	Alright, thanks.
10813959	10817002	Alright, take care.
10817022	10821427	1-877-GAME-OLR or use him on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
10822468	10824189	I think I'm just going to say that to all the callers tonight.
10825270	10827432	Just, you know, why not?
10827592	10831556	Alright, 1-877-GAME-OLR or use him on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
10831576	10834499	While we wait for some calls, Loki, do we have any last minute stories tonight?
10835127	10835727	Snoop Dogg
10861897	10862898	Alright, let's go to the phones.
10862918	10864178	We've got more calls coming in.
10865399	10867420	But they're produced exclusively for Rock Band.
10867440	10868380	Hold on, we're getting hammered with calls.
10868400	10869281	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
10869301	10869621	Who's this?
10872342	10872682	Hello?
10872863	10873783	I think they hung up.
10873903	10874844	Hi, Orange Launch Radio.
10874964	10875264	You there?
10875664	10876344	Nope, it ended.
10876424	10876925	They hung up.
10878125	10879186	Trigger finger, I don't know.
10879406	10880166	Let's go to another call.
10880206	10881127	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
10881147	10881467	Who's this?
10882236	10883057	Hey, this is X-Link.
10883098	10883779	Hi, X-Link.
10883799	10884500	How are you, my friend?
10885021	10885622	Doing good.
10885842	10886383	Doing well.
10887064	10892053	Watching my fiance over here playing on my iTouch, the How Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader, so...
10892982	10894202	Ah, that show.
10894702	10897483	I can't believe they let Jeff Foxworthy host a game show.
10897903	10903404	But speaking of game shows, the prices right on Facebook is a complete crap.
10903784	10904144	Really?
10904665	10905965	You are hating, alright?
10906005	10906705	I'm hating it.
10906825	10907505	Why are you hating it?
10907545	10910746	It's a completely watered down version of the PC game.
10910766	10916407	Just spend 20 bucks by the PC game, just go through it and you can unlock every single one of those games and play as much as you want.
10917591	10925879	Don't sit there spending $7, $8 trying to unlock every single one of those games, which you can do the same thing for $20, maybe even a little less, and you can find it somewhere on sale or even on eBay or something.
10926620	10932125	But will the PC game allow me to post how I'm doing in the game so I can show off my EP into the world?
10932726	10934908	Why not just take a screenshot and do the same thing?
10935189	10941215	Well, will it let me possibly, if my team score is high enough, win a trip to LA to see a backstage...
10941980	10943101	Taping or whatever it was called.
10943121	10945582	Why would you want to do that when you're already near LA as it is?
10945602	10946443	I'm not that close.
10947884	10951046	Hey, apparently I'm not able to fly there as I learned this week.
10952507	10954888	Burning down planes and everything.
10955228	10956529	I'm just that awesome, I guess.
10956649	10957410	Burning down the house.
10957950	10958811	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10984250	10994913	Same thing with the iTouch versions of Price is Right and Press Your Luck were both also watered down versions of the PC ones.
10994933	10997053	Some of those iPod games are really horrible.
10997093	11000754	And I'll tell you, I finally was able to upgrade to the iPhone 4 this week.
11000794	11003295	I didn't talk about it earlier in the show because I had other video games to talk about.
11003335	11007176	But I finally, being the sheep I am, I upgraded to an iPhone 4.
11007296	11012997	One of the great things about it is that now it has the speed to actually be able to play a lot of the games that are out there for it.
11013417	11014898	But some of them aren't worth my time.
11015238	11019560	Like there's a port of Sonic 2 available, which, you know, don't get me wrong.
11019640	11022102	I love Sonic and Sega makes some great games.
11022202	11025303	But the frame rate, even on the iPhone 4, is kind of junky.
11025363	11028565	And just controlling with the touchscreen is kind of crap.
11028645	11030946	Like it just doesn't make for a good experience.
11031347	11035549	Not everything in the world has to be on the frigging iPhone, you know.
11036370	11036790	I agree.
11038794	11046287	I'm a big fan of a lot of different games, and a lot of games, when they try to port it over, it was turning into absolute crap.
11046347	11047910	It's like, what did they do with this?
11047990	11049393	Why did they do this in the first place?
11050638	11062869	It's really interesting though just how saturated the marketplace has become.
11062909	11066913	They say it's almost impossible to make money in there now because it's just so, so saturated.
11066973	11072678	It takes so much for your game to stick out amongst everything that's out there that a lot of people are really struggling.
11073604	11076906	I totally agree.
11077026	11079228	I mean, nothing against any of these games.
11079308	11080309	I love Price is Right.
11080329	11081029	I love that kind of stuff.
11081049	11086272	And the only reason why I didn't blast it out to everybody on my Facebook page is because I didn't really want everybody to be playing it.
11086313	11088374	I looked at it, and I'm like, at first, it wasn't even loading.
11088514	11089455	It wasn't even loading at first.
11089495	11091056	It was coming up as a blink screen.
11091096	11094978	And when they did it, it was like, when I saw it, I'm like, no, I'm not doing this.
11095419	11101803	To be fair, to play Devil's Advocate just a little bit, the game is still in beta, so it's not going to be perfect.
11101823	11103024	I just got to throw that out there.
11104344	11111466	Yes, but I'd rather pay my $20 PC game that I bought.
11111586	11120067	I guess one point you do make, you only get to play so many games of The Price is Right for free, and then if you want more coins, you have to buy them with real money.
11120467	11122448	So I totally get your point.
11122508	11126789	Don't spend real money on this game if you could just plop down $20 and get a superior game.
11126989	11128089	I'll agree with that.
11128849	11130490	or even cheaper depending on where you buy it from.
11130530	11133711	I mean, I've seen it even on sale as low as $10 depending on what place it's from.
11133811	11134751	So, I mean, yes.
11134911	11138212	I mean, you know, like I said before, it's worth the wait.
11138272	11140153	And the games are really good.
11140213	11141973	I mean, they did a really good job with Press Your Luck.
11142413	11143294	I love it for the PC.
11143334	11144254	I play it all the time.
11144334	11147615	I love how there's 17 different episodes you can go through and unlock different stuff.
11148195	11153696	But as for the other versions, other than maybe that and the Wii, it was crap.
11153916	11157177	It was like they just threw it out there without even knowing what was going on.
11157677	11171200	And I would love to see the PlayStation version have like avatar support, but unfortunately, like I said before, the reason it didn't is because of the fact that it was a bad replica of the port basically from that of the PC or the Wii.
11172617	11178138	Alright, well anything I gotta wrap up here, anything else you wanna talk to our listeners about tonight, real quick?
11178158	11200622	Nah, that's pretty much it, that's all I know to say, that and the fact at this point that Civ 4 demo won't be coming out to the day of, but Civ 5, but yes, it's not coming out to the day of I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I was I've been so behind you myself There's too many damn games to keep track of these days, it's alright Alright, well thank you for the call my friend really appreciate it, have a wonderful week and stay black You too, 5,000 What'd he say at the end there?
11201586	11202187	I missed that.
11202347	11202987	I missed it too.
11203448	11206930	I hope it wasn't another plain joke because, yeah, they frown on those.
11207370	11209151	Alright, that's it for the Skype line tonight.
11209452	11210672	Thank you guys so much for calling.
11210712	11211353	We appreciate it.
11211373	11214395	Sorry if you didn't get through, but please, you can always send us an email, a tweet.
11214495	11215476	It's not too much to ask.
11216336	11217057	140 characters or less.
11218072	11220534	Loki, any stories you want to get out here before we finish?
11221194	11225097	Yeah, I was just checking that right now to see if there was anything we didn't talk about.
11225237	11227859	You know what, Tigerclaw's throwing one out in chat I'll mention real quick.
11228000	11232503	I don't remember hearing this either unless Matt had just covered it before in the last one.
11233063	11234505	There's an Epic Mickey Collector's Edition.
11234565	11235085	Did you mention that?
11235345	11237266	No, I didn't mention that, but whatever
11258252	11264157	They had also a new collector's edition for Dead Rising 2 where you can actually get it from Capcom.
11264537	11268380	It comes with a bunch of poker chips and custom poker cards and stuff like that.
11268760	11274204	And then also a chance to win a six foot tall life-size statue of a zombie.
11275685	11276386	But that's only, you know...
11277282	11281024	I thought at first, before I actually read the article, that it was every single package.
11281044	11282625	I was like, oh, gonna buy that instantly.
11282805	11286307	But obviously that would be way too expensive.
11286847	11289669	But that's something that they're gonna be giving away.
11291310	11291870	Let's see.
11292030	11294752	Stuff that maybe we didn't talk about.
11298794	11299114	Ah, yes.
11299814	11303476	Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep is not coming to the PlayStation Network.
11303516	11306378	So if you own a PSP Go, you ain't playing that game.
11308120	11310216	Thank you Square Enix Um
11312011	11313691	See, we talked a little bit about Angry Birds.
11315032	11319113	I guess the devs working with Hollywood Advisors on a possible movie pitch.
11319833	11322494	They will probably accept it because they're desperate for stuff.
11324874	11328315	The full track list for DJ Hero 2 got released.
11328375	11332116	Well, by track list, it means the songs that they will be using in the mixes.
11332917	11334377	Some cool stuff, though, I actually like.
11334677	11338418	It was funny, one of the songs I was actually almost going to pick for a Cage Mackenzie.
11338738	11355079	and still might pick the Prodigy Omen off their new album is on there and of course the classic Firestarter is part of that as well some new Tiesto tracks on there Speed Rail I Will Be Here and Come On
11357202	11359264	lots of Lady Gaga, actually.
11359705	11364770	They're going to have Love Game, Bad Romance, and Just Dance in there as well.
11365070	11368173	Of course, Connie West, Love Lockdown, and Heartless.
11369374	11374540	And then they've got some random old school stuff in there, like they have...
11377143	11381028	Janet Jackson, Axl F, Gorillaz, Stylo, Donna Summers, Bad Girls,
11398566	11400607	New Order's Blue Monday is going to be in there.
11401888	11403069	Orbital with the box.
11403589	11405050	That's pretty awesome they have Orbital in there.
11405331	11406331	Salt and Pepper's Push It.
11407332	11413597	And then it's kind of cool Justice is going to be in there as well with D.A.N.C.E.
11413757	11415178	and also Waters of Nazareth.
11415558	11418800	I don't remember Waters of Nazareth but I did put in D.A.N.C.E.
11419081	11420522	in Cage Match so that's kind of cool.
11421062	11422143	But yeah, lots of cool stuff.
11422523	11425165	Only one Daft Punk song, so that's a little depressing.
11425305	11426325	Human After All is in there.
11427886	11430348	Basement Jackson, Where's Your Head At?
11431689	11432569	Yeah, lots of cool stuff.
11432729	11433770	Very excited about it.
11434030	11445197	In fact, actually, they have a Facebook app that you can check out that's a contest where you're supposed to guess what the mashups are, and they're kind of giving you a little bit of a preview of some of the songs that are actually going to be in the game, the sets and stuff.
11445217	11446357	So that's kind of neat.
11446377	11446998	So check that out.
11447578	11452561	Alright, I wonder if there's any standalone songs, because there were a few of those in year one, like Herbie Hancock.
11452581	11457884	There might be some beat juggles or whatever, so that could be cool.
11459605	11459946	I don't know.
11462027	11462367	We'll see.
11463448	11469471	Alright, well if that's it for Last Minute Stories, then I guess it's time to go around and get everybody's final thought.
11469912	11471132	It's time to end another show.
11471232	11471953	Boo hoo, sad.
11473274	11474134	Final thoughts tonight.
11474174	11476015	DarkSakra, what's your final thought tonight?
11476276	11476976	My arms hurt.
11477523	11478144	I'm sorry to hear that.
11478624	11479785	Loki, you have a final thought tonight?
11480425	11481466	One last thing I was going to say.
11481646	11486310	Portal is also going to become part of the syllabus at apparently Wabash College.
11487631	11490834	It's actually, you know, I don't think you have to read it, but obviously play it.
11491795	11492575	Heck of a final thought.
11492896	11500682	Yeah, but no, my final thought is I have a headache from lack of sleep and I don't anticipate it going away and that sucks.
11501980	11505421	My final thought is, back to work tomorrow, back to the real world.
11505481	11507222	Boo-hoo, cry, sob.
11507262	11508603	But hey, three-day weekend coming up.
11508663	11509563	Yay!
