0	20640	tonight, August 29th, 2010, could Sony soon adopt the controversial online pass, two retail
20640	25640	chains jump in the used video game market, and an upcoming MMO plans to penalize players
25640	33800	that play too much. Orange Lounge Radio. Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome
33800	39680	to another week of Orange Lounge Radio, the video game show where every gamer has a voice.
39680	45800	We do tape live every Sunday night at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, 6 o'clock pacific,
45800	49880	9 o'clock eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show. My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be
49880	54780	joining over the next few hours with my awesome co-hosts, always here every week, say hello
54780	60160	to the one and only, Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers. I hope I'm always here, it's my house. Well,
60160	63400	there have been times where you haven't been here, and those are the awkward shows. The
63400	68240	awkward shows where Dan's like, are they gonna run off with the vault? Well, there's also
68240	73360	been about, you know, six different studios in OLR's history, we tend to bounce around
73360	77680	like a, I don't know, homeless college kid. This one's my favorite. Well, of course, yeah,
77680	81240	cause you just have to roll out of bed and into the studio, this is my least favorite
81240	85880	cause I have to drive out here. At least I like you. Alright. I liked your garage too.
85880	92120	It was nice. It was hot. Yes. Alright, also say hello to Tech Master Loki. Hello. We used
92120	96200	to tape the show at his house too, when it was my house too. Yes. Remember that? Years
96200	101160	ago. Yes. Years ago. I was like probably the second place we ever did the show. That was,
101160	107480	imagine if OLR was your life. That was pretty much that apartment. Good times, good times.
107480	112960	How have you been doing, Loki? How's the baby? How's life? Um, fine. Just, you know, I don't
112960	118040	get a lot of sleep. Of course, that's what they say. Yep, so. You seem to be doing okay
118040	121920	though. You seem to be awake enough, but if you don't... Well, I can thank, you know,
121920	128600	playing Final Fantasy XI for early hours in the morning, you know, to thank for that since,
128600	133520	you know, that kind of got me accustomed to, you know, being able to operate without that
133520	138320	much sleep. Well, if you nod off during the show, we'll know what's going on, right? Yeah,
138320	145320	you're boring me. Well, let's hope not. We also have our chat room to gauge us. Chat.orangeloungeradio.com,
145320	149280	the always present fourth guest on the show, especially when there isn't actually a fourth
149280	153600	guest here in studio tonight, as there is not tonight. It's the first show in a while
153600	156800	that I can remember where it's just the three of us. Doing it the way we've done it for
156800	161540	many, many years now. Anyhow, we're going to get into gaming news, but we always like
161540	165400	to start off the show with a little bit of, how was your gaming week? So, how was your
165400	171040	gaming week, DarkSakura? Um, it was fairly old school. I don't know if the pile of Master
171040	175280	System games is still out in the front room, because I've gotten used to it out there,
175280	182280	but Dan was playing some Alex Kidd in Shinobi World and Zillion, a lot of Zillion, and we
183800	187200	played a couple things together. What ever happened to the Alex Kidd games? It kind of
187200	192720	disappeared. He did them on Genesis. I remember when I was growing up, I sort of saw Alex
192720	196960	Kidd as sort of like Sega's Mario, because keep in mind, Sonic didn't show up until the
196960	201680	Genesis. But Sega got Sonic and that went away. And then they had a Master System version
201680	207920	of Sonic. That only came out in Brazil. And that was also after the Genesis version was
207920	212280	out, because remember Blast Processing was the secret to Sonic, remember that? So there
212280	215240	wasn't, yeah, I mean, yeah, there was a Sonic on the Master System, but it was a little
215240	220960	bit, you know, not, it was way after the fact. So I sort of saw, back in the day, Alex Kidd
220960	226240	as the Mario on Sega's system. I mean, I don't know, in my young mind, that's kind of what
226240	231280	I saw. So it's odd to me that Alex Kidd kind of disappeared, save for the, doesn't he make
231280	235320	cameos in some of the Sega sports games and things like that? That's really it. I think.
235320	239000	You know, one game that I forgot that we had that is actually kind of cool, the only reason
239000	248120	we really have this is because it was an oddity in printing. We have Monopoly. Wow. As a monopoly,
248120	254920	but they actually did M-O-N-O, space, capital P-O-L-Y. Awesome. So we have Monopoly. Monopoly.
254920	259400	Nice. And, but Dan didn't actually have the Master System, he was using the power-based
259400	264360	converter on the Genesis. And then I played some Star Trek online today. I made an Andorian
264360	275240	chick just because. And I really haven't, I was given a game on Steam. And one of our
275240	280760	listeners sent me something fantastic. And I put it over here, because I've been waiting
280760	286420	for Dan to get off the old school kick so I could play Final Fantasy 13. Thank you.
286420	292960	Gave me Rival School's drama album. Wait, from a listener? Yeah. Wow. And it was addressed
292960	299240	to Sakura Kasugano. Do you know what listener sent that to you? I'm trying to remember that
299240	307480	I've got the box right here, but he didn't put the name on it. It's just his real name.
307480	310360	I don't know who that is, but I know where that city and state is. I know exactly where
310360	317600	that is. Yeah. Just outside the big city there. Yeah. Yeah. Interesting. But it's really cool.
317600	324040	I love it. And I can understand about half of it. But I mean, I'm a big, I'm a big...
324040	331120	This one's actually the first one, the Shiritz Justice Kakuen. So. Wow. I'm pretty happy.
331120	335040	This has been like the year of getting strange packages in the mail from listeners. Because
335040	338960	I didn't... Loki, you got like a full freaking Xbox from a listener, didn't you? Yeah, J-Tech
338960	342720	system. And you never figured out who sent that to you? Nope. DarkSakura just... Send
342720	347360	me one!...forgot the guy's online name and doesn't want to say his real name. Yeah, I'm
347360	356640	like that. I got... I'm going to say, thank you, Fred. Civ 4 I got from X-Link and I got
356640	361960	the same Steam game you did, so. Oh, that was... Okay. Because yeah, I've been meaning
361960	367640	to try it out. It's just... I started school last week. Yeah. So, of course, there goes...
367640	376280	I play Peggle at Fuddruckers. When they ruin my order! Let me go into our chatroom at chat.orangeslaunceready.com.
376280	381720	DarkKisuke is in chat trying to take responsibility for sending it to you, but said JK. Let's
381720	386600	see. DarkTetsuya says, I do know what my favorite Sega Master Sister game is. Toss-up between
386600	391720	the Ghostbusters port and Astro Warrior. Was the Ghostbusters port on Sega Master System
391720	396040	the same one that was on like Commodore 64 and the computers back in the early 80s? Or
396040	400760	is that a different Ghostbusters game? Because I love the one that was on Commodore 64. The
400760	405160	one that had like... There was the Gatekeeper and the Keymaster and you didn't... When they
405160	410320	joined up, the game was over. Unless you had so many points, then you could climb the tower.
410320	417280	Ah, forget it. Forget it. Are you the Gatekeeper? So this is the last semester of school for
417280	422800	you, right? You graduate this year? Well, not forever the last semester. We've been
422800	427160	in school since the show started. Well, you know why? And I've got to say this. There's
427160	431520	nothing wrong with always wanting to enrich the mind. I spent way too much time doing
431520	435280	what everyone else said that I should do instead of doing what I love. And now I just said,
435280	441480	fuck it. I'm doing what I love. And I'm going to graduate with my AA. And I'm going to do
441480	446000	a year of the rest of my gen ed for... I'm actually kind of thinking of not going to
446000	450100	Sac State, maybe going to UC Davis. You know, it'll be a drive, but I might get a better
450100	453560	education out of it. So you'd say the life lesson you learned is that you should go to
453560	460560	school to study what you love? Yeah. Can I major in pornography in college? Rob. What?
460560	465400	My point is, is that when you find something that you can make a living out of that you
465400	472300	love, go for it. I also love food, but I can't cook. So I'm, I don't know what you can do.
472300	476520	You could actually take journalism classes and be a food critic. That's a really, ooh,
476520	481080	that's now that's a good idea. And then have like... Aren't all food critics fat? Like
481080	484000	I've never known. I mean, don't take offense if you're a food critic. I've never known
484000	487060	any, but... You can have high metabolism or actually you may be healthy. But they're all
487060	494400	pompous asses. At least that's what I've gathered from watching Iron Chef. Actually on Iron
494400	499820	Chef America, Julie Chen is a food critic and she's my hero. So I... We should do like
499820	507500	a one off side podcast that's called Fat Butt. And talk about all the food we love that makes
507500	513320	our butts fat. That's what Alan calls me actually. So I could be the host, Fat Butt. He shouldn't
513320	518660	call you Fat Bump. He should call you Plus Booty. I'm not going to get into it. Actually
518660	525500	my nickname is Fat Kitty. I'm just going to get into that. I'm going to get a text message
525500	533560	in five, four, three, stop talking! Alright, anyhow. If that's it for Dark Soccer's gaming
533560	538320	week, Loki, how was your gaming week? It was okay. Didn't really play a lot except for
538320	543920	on Friday where we did this kind of company sales team building thing where we went to
543920	551720	Dave and Buster's and played some games. The whole team building portion of that event
551720	558320	was kind of dumb because they have this arcade full of wonderful games and they put you on
558320	562640	all the really crappy games. Except for say, Rallying Classic, which is better known as
562640	570640	Daytona sans license. And that was fun. But the person, they had us split up in the groups
570640	576400	and stuff of four. So we were all teams of four. And the guy that was in charge of our
576400	582600	three teams of four was an idiot. And instead of putting three people up each round to have
582600	588020	them go head to head against each team, they just had each team compete against themselves.
588020	594480	And because of that and his horrible score keeping, we ended up near last place because
594480	598000	he was a clean idiot. Not that it matters because it was just for fun, but whatever.
598000	603760	It's still a waste of time. I did though play some arcade games. I got to play the Rambo
603760	608880	shooting game, which is kind of funny. They had that at Golf Land too. Did you play the
608880	612600	Terminator one? Because that one's actually really fun. No, I did walk past it a bunch
612600	616600	of times and that looked really cool. And it's hard! But I just didn't get a chance
616600	622920	to do that. There's so many pretty games there. But I actually played some DDR. I played DDRX.
622920	630180	And I, because I wasn't really familiar with the machine, I got stuck doing singles beginner.
630180	636240	Like one credit. And it was really annoying. And it was really strange. And I don't know
636240	640600	if the timing's different on beginner mode or something like that. But for some reason
640600	644640	I did horribly in beginner mode. But then when I actually played normal games and even
644640	651960	on doubles and stuff I did a lot better. How that works is beyond me, but that's what happened.
651960	656780	So I played some doubles on that. I don't really care for the new stage that they have.
656780	662320	It looks really cheap because it's all one single sheet of metal that they have in there
662320	666520	instead of all the little panels, which are really cool looking. But yeah, whatever. And
666520	676400	the spacing's a little different. But that's minor. Let's see, what else? I played a game
676400	682200	called Tank Tank Tank, which is kind of fun. Which mission did you do? Did you do the giant
682200	688400	monster mission? Well we just played versus, so. Ah, no. Next time you play that you have
688400	694680	to do co-op and play against the giant bees. And the giant squid. And then the building
694680	697960	mecha. But you were telling me about this game. This game is so much fun! It's tank
697960	704840	versus bees. That's strange. Well, you can either choose versus or two tanks versus two
704840	711400	other tanks. Or you can go against the evil robot hordes. And so you get these big missiles
711400	715760	with granny faces on them. They're so fantastic. These are pretty fucking terrible. I call
715760	720960	them mecha bees. Tank Tank Tank was pretty fun. And there was some other game that we
720960	725040	played. It was kind of like Trackmania, the arcade game almost. And that was alright.
725040	734240	What else did I play there? That was about it. I just played a lot of DDR. I'm not very
734240	741200	in shape anymore. And it's been a while since I played DDR. But I actually did play A on
741200	748680	doubles on, I guess it's called Expert now, which is like an 11 footer. And I passed it,
748680	754320	oh my god, I felt like crap afterwards. Of course, now that I think of it, I don't think
754320	758040	there's ever been a time that I played A on doubles on heavy or whatever that I actually
758040	762360	didn't feel like crap afterwards. So that's fine. Did you go right into playing a hard
762360	769120	song? Well no, that was my last song. I actually played... Still, just in one game, you played,
769120	777360	you know, wow. You ever heard of a warm up? I did play warm up stuff. I did, it was really
777360	782680	tiring me out though because I'm not used to it anymore. So I was playing, you know,
782680	786000	some of the new songs that were in there were kind of dumb, so I didn't really care for
786000	794640	the new DDRX songs, I guess. I played, actually a few times I played Hysteria because I liked
794640	801040	one of the patterns for, I guess it was the, I don't even know what they call it now, the
801040	805160	second setting. It would have been Trick, I don't remember. Yeah, they changed them
805160	809720	all just to change them. It's just annoying. Whatever. Red difficulty, right? Yes, the
809720	815560	medium difficulty. I liked the double pattern for that, so that was fun. And then I was
815560	821600	trying to remember like, I remember there was, you know, 20 November I know if you play
821600	826560	that on I think heavy and little that like makes no notes for like quite a while, that
826560	835920	would have been fun. Also, there's another one that was like that. Anyway, so played
835920	840640	a few rounds of that and that was fun. And then of course, you know, Redemption stuff
840640	847640	played some Deal or No Deal because, I mean, that game was super easy. But yeah, so now
847640	851920	it was funny because I had a bunch of Dave and Buster power cards from like back when
851920	856680	we went to our first E3, like when we went to Irvine, you know, and went to that Dave
856680	860560	and Buster's. I had a card from that. I had one. Wow, that was a long time ago. I had
860560	866920	one from when we went to Milpitas one time and then so I combined that together with
866920	871920	one that they gave us to use during this competition. Then I got another one from them later on.
871920	876960	So I have like a bunch of credits at Dave and Buster's right now. I just haven't gotten
876960	880700	a chance to use them. But it's not bad. It's a small one compared to the other ones. They
880700	885080	even said, though, like because the people are reps at Dave and Buster's, they said it's
885080	889320	one of the, I think it's the smallest one that they have. Which is kind of lame, but
889320	893400	whatever. It's nice to at least have one. They should put another one in Folsom, though.
893400	897600	I definitely agree that because there's nothing in Folsom. And it's kind of weird that they
897600	901800	put Dave and Buster's like right next to Golf Land and right down the street from, you know,
901800	905680	John's Incredible Pizza. You know, all these different like fun land places. It's weird.
905680	910320	They're right there. And then of course, other than that, Grand Theft Auto, Lost in Damned
910320	914600	has been playing a lot more of that. And that's still fun. Working on mod stuff. It's kind
914600	919000	of annoying, though, because the, I'm sure not a lot of people are familiar with the
919000	926080	Grand Theft Auto console modding community. But they're very, I don't know, very, I don't
926080	933520	know what the word would be for it. They're dicks, I guess. It's because they figure out
933520	938080	something and then they kind of hold it above everybody's head. Well, I figured out something,
938080	943120	so I posted about it because, you know, it's it's kind of cool. I thought I'd share something.
943120	946160	And so now they're saying, oh, well, we're going to, you know, we did the same thing
946160	950760	and and, you know, we're not going to tell you guys how to do it until a while from now.
950760	954760	So I posted in that same thread how to do it. And they went and deleted my post. I'm
954760	961640	like, you motherfuckers. So I got to release something. Wait, what is this? It's modding
961640	966560	the game. I know how to I figured out how to change the maps and actually I figured
966560	971320	out how to change work. Different cars spawn and stuff like that. It's all your own website.
971320	976720	It's all within the law. I don't even give a crap. I just I'm OK. You just I do post
976720	980560	an Orange Lounge radio story. It's really easy. I'll send you the PDF the deep man made.
980560	984360	You post a new story to orange launch radio dot com. Title of story. What's the name of
984360	991320	this website? The Seven Sins Fuck Seven Sins and then post the your your acts and all.
991320	995800	It's there's it's like high school drama. It's so it's probably a bunch of high school
995800	1002240	or it's sad. It's really sad. But it the only thing I have a problem with, though, is someone
1002240	1005840	claiming credit to something that I figured out a long time ago. And there's even a post
1005840	1009760	that's like weeks old that's on that damn website. But, you know, of course, it's a
1009760	1013320	few pages back. So people don't realize it. Would you would you like to give out a hack
1013320	1018080	right now? So you you have patent pending? No, I already I already have a YouTube video
1018080	1023160	out there of it. And so I'm all set. I've got my bases covered. But it's just that,
1023160	1028240	you know, these days, Loki has dibs. It's just like they sent me a private message that
1028240	1034800	says, don't worry, we'll give you you know, we're crediting you for indirectly, you know,
1034800	1038920	coming up with this idea. I'm like indirectly. I directly came up with this fucking idea.
1038920	1045200	Stupid indirectly inspired you to come up with this idea. Basically, I walked you through
1045200	1052520	it. Whatever this guys sound. It's dumb. I don't mean to be little kids, you know, whatever.
1052520	1059400	It's just it's it's frustrating. I don't really care that, you know, I just have problems
1059400	1063840	people taking credit for something I came up with. The whole point was I was just trying
1063840	1068040	to give them an idea because all the stuff that they have out there right now, hacks
1068040	1072640	is just people editing like the lines for the handling of the cars and stuff like that.
1072640	1076360	So, oh, look, this car is fast. Oh, look, this car, you know, crashes through things.
1076360	1081120	Oh, this one flies. Big fucking whoop. All right. I got I got to take a sidetrack here
1081120	1084480	to read some of the chat comments because they've been accumulating here. Spazinator
1084480	1088760	PSN is talking about that tank, tank, tank game. Says when you beat tank, tank, tank
1088760	1097200	and watch the credits, it says tanks for playing. Yep. Get it? See, remember earlier I was talking
1097200	1102440	about food and porn and all that and what we should major in in school. Satellite Minded
1102440	1107040	in Chat says Rob should combine food and porn and make a living from that. And Rama follows
1107040	1111880	that up with a website called www dot food porn daily dot com, which I'd never heard
1111880	1117040	of. But, yeah, I'm all you do is you click on pictures of food like this one is mac and
1117040	1123440	cheese with bacon and chicken. Mm hmm. Then I click it again. Mm hmm. Pork chops with
1123440	1131840	parsley. Yum. And it's still food porn. Mm hmm. Salmon sliders. What about this is why
1131840	1138840	you're fat. A lot of that stuff makes me ill. But this this is this is like classy porn.
1138840	1149380	Like this is more like this is the difference between an escort. Yes. And, uh, 20 buck prostitute.
1149380	1154760	This is like Cinemax right here. The food porn daily is like Cinemax. And this is why
1154760	1158600	you're fat dot com is like hustler. That's that's basically the difference between the
1158600	1164040	two. There you go. All right. Anyhow, anything else for your gaming week, Loki? Sorry. No,
1164040	1171540	that's really it. I'm just glad, though, my dev kids coming next week. So, uh, I'm excited
1171540	1175080	to see you how that kind of works out for you. Curious what that well, how that plays
1175080	1181200	or whatever. We'll see. All right. Let's see my gaming week. I've been playing. Oh, fine.
1181200	1187180	Not my gaming. It's just a story real quick. And it's funny. Yes. I experienced on my way
1187180	1194560	over to the show today what I would consider white trash karaoke. Literally, my neighbor
1194560	1198360	across the street. I don't know if they dug out a karaoke machine or whatever, but there
1198360	1203800	was some really obnoxious loud music blaring from their garage. I thought it was like a
1203800	1209000	country western band or something practicing. No, it's this fat chick out there just saying
1209000	1214840	some really horrible song. Please tell me she's singing like, you know, cash or something.
1214840	1220520	No, wake up in the morning feeling like today. It's like some country western song. God.
1220520	1226400	But it was awful. I'm like, why would you blast that? Seriously? I thought they were
1226400	1231280	having like a party or something, but no, it's just this one one chick apparently wanting
1231280	1236360	to annoy the wants to be famous. Um, let's see. Well, I actually will start off. I have
1236360	1240480	a completely like doesn't have anything to do a gaming story, but I had a very strange
1240480	1245040	weekend. Okay. Um, I was actually supposed to be going to L.A. this weekend, but I didn't
1245040	1249720	end up going. And part of the reason why I didn't end up going is that I was scheduled
1249720	1254120	to take a flight on JetBlue from Sacramento to Long Beach because that's, you know, probably
1254120	1257540	one of the easiest ways to get to L.A. And JetBlue is a fine airline. You can watch TV
1257540	1261760	in the back seats and everything. Um, so we get to the airport, we're sitting there waiting
1261760	1267680	for our flight to go and suddenly they come on the intercom and say, um, well, uh, your
1267680	1273560	plane had to do a evacuate. There was an emergency. The brakes caught fire and, uh, they, and
1273560	1277080	sure enough, we're looking out the window and there's this plane sitting there on the
1277080	1281040	runway and the slides are all inflated and all these people are standing out kind of
1281040	1285640	looking. And yeah, if you heard about that, cause it was kind of a big deal. It was on
1285640	1289720	like CNN and stuff. Yeah. I was supposed to be on that plane. So I was sitting there in
1289720	1294640	the terminal while that plane was landing, waiting to board it. Uh, so yeah, that was
1294640	1299120	kind of a day ruiner. We tried to catch another flight that was seven hours later in Oakland,
1299120	1302480	but we were like, okay, well at least we'll still get to go to L.A. at some point. And
1302480	1307040	then, uh, yeah, that flight ended up getting delayed for about three and a half hours cause
1307040	1309960	the whole system was backed up. And that's about the point where we said fuck it because
1309960	1314000	a, we could have just driven there faster. B, we were going to lose our rental car and
1314000	1318640	all this other stuff and it was kind of annoying. So, uh, kind of a bummer. But yeah, just a
1318640	1321680	completely random story cause you know, it's, it's not every day that you're sitting right
1321680	1324960	in front of national news unfolding before your eyes. But one kind of cool thing that
1324960	1330520	did happen, I was posting about it on Twitter and uh, one of my friends actually took pictures
1330520	1336440	of the whole thing unfolding and uh, the associated press contacted us cause they saw me on Twitter
1336440	1342200	and actually bought her picture to use on their story. That's pretty cool. Yeah. How
1342200	1347880	much did they pay her? $75. Oh, she should have. She was thinking she probably could
1347880	1352680	have gotten more, but at the same time when you're, you don't like at a moment like that,
1352680	1356400	you're not thinking like, Oh, I want to take a picture so I can sell it. You know, and
1356400	1359680	it was more one of those, I think it was more of a novelty thing, right? Like how many people
1359680	1363160	can say they've sold the pictures of the associated price, right? You know, not every, that, that's
1363160	1367480	not an everyday occurrence. So, you know, I think she did it more for the novelty of
1367480	1370520	it than for the actual money. And I can't say I blame her. I would have done the same
1370520	1375140	thing. I took pictures too on Twitter. It's just that iPhone pictures don't have nearly
1375140	1378560	the detail that she actually took them on a real camera. That's why they wanted her
1378560	1385360	pictures cause not a lot of people had that. So yeah, kind of a weird weekend. So, um,
1385360	1389600	let's see. Monty Boggs in our chat room says stuff like that happens in airlines bitch
1389600	1394480	about how not enough people are flying. You know what though? Not to get too far off topic
1394480	1397640	of the topic of games, except that I was supposed to be playing a bunch of them this weekend
1397640	1403000	and didn't get to because of this. Um, Monty Boggs, the thing is though that every time
1403000	1407380	something like this happens, like, okay, the SAC airport is not that big of an airport,
1407380	1411900	but this was, I'm sure on the news wherever it is you live. I know this was on the news
1411900	1417960	in like Connecticut. It was on CNN. It was on MSNBC. Nobody died. Nobody was severely
1417960	1422360	hurt. Like a few people were taken to the hospital, but it's because a lot of whiplash
1422360	1426780	type conditions because of the breaking of the plane. And apparently people got rug burns
1426780	1430900	from sliding down those inflatable slides. And those are the injuries that people had.
1430900	1436540	So it's unfortunate and it sucks, but I've seen car accidents that were tons worse, you
1436540	1441180	know, and you don't hear about every single car accident. So I still think flying is pretty
1441180	1445700	safe all things considered. I'm just, I'm glad the brakes decided to go when they did
1445700	1449380	and not an hour later cause I would prefer to just have stayed at home all weekend and
1449380	1453500	not be in the hospital in Long Beach being treated for burns cause I had to take a trip
1453500	1457760	down the slide. However, if I did have to go down the slide, I'd at least grab a beer
1457760	1464180	first like that guy did. All right. Beer is great. Let me talk about actual games. I just,
1464180	1466980	I had to talk about that cause national news being right in front of me doesn't happen
1466980	1471860	every day. All right. So, um, games. I've been playing Warcraft, of course, still working
1471860	1475460	on my characters. We're about halfway through Icecrown Citadel, which is cool. And the whole
1475460	1480380	guild's gearing up and it's cool, but Cataclysm really needs to be out like now. Like I'm
1480380	1484540	ready for it. I think we all are. Uh, been playing more Starcraft 2. I've been trying
1484540	1488860	to, just trying to go after some of the achievements a little bit and just playing, kind of playing
1488860	1492580	the campaign a little bit here and there. I'm pressing very slowly through that game,
1492580	1496440	but considering I didn't even want to play it at first, I'm surprisingly having a really
1496440	1499700	good time with that. I do have a couple of new games I want to talk about this week.
1499700	1504660	First off, out on PlayStation Network this week was an adaptation of Pressure Luck. This
1504660	1508100	game has already come out on the PC and the Wii and I think there's an iPhone version
1508100	1512060	as well, but it came out on PlayStation Network this week and it was really the first chance
1512060	1516420	I had to check it out. You know, I have the DVD game from a few years ago, which I believe
1516420	1520300	Jamie actually gave me as a gift a couple years ago. I have that. That's really the
1520300	1523660	only version of the game I have to compare it to, which you can't compare a video game
1523660	1530300	to a DVD game. Sorry. I never really played the Wii game. I've only heard about it. And
1530300	1534740	I've only really heard about the PC game as well. So I haven't really played them. The
1534740	1542580	PlayStation one, it's okay. Like there's some really cool things and then there's some really
1542580	1546860	not so cool things that really detract from it. And some of the cool things what I like
1546860	1551380	is that, you know, they give it the look and feel of Pressure Luck. When the thing starts,
1551380	1555300	you know, it's like, these players are about to play a game that could be the biggest game
1555300	1558460	of their lives as they're about to press the whole spiel they would say in the beginning
1558460	1563740	and it looks like the show and it's really cute. And then when you're actually playing
1563740	1567780	the board sequences, it's a lot of fun. Like, you know, your character's actually going
1567780	1571740	big bucks, big bucks, no whammies, you know, they're actually saying it and then and the
1571740	1575780	whammy animations are actually really well done. That's actually probably the best thing
1575780	1579760	about the adaptation. I saw some on the trailer. Yeah, the whammy there. There's new stuff
1579760	1583380	like there's you know how they would always be like pop culture tie ins. Like I always
1583380	1588140	remember the little whammy that was like boy George that would sing Do you do you really
1588140	1596100	want to wear me? I don't know why I remember this stuff from when I was like seven. Okay.
1596100	1599820	But now they have like an American Idol whammy and some of these other like pop culture references
1599820	1605500	and that's really cool. But unfortunately, with these really high points, there's also
1605500	1613060	a lot of like clunk. Like, just the interface feels very clunky. The shell around the game
1613060	1619140	itself feels very rushed and just not flashy at all like a game show should be. It feels
1619140	1624800	very Facebook game to me. The avatar designer is very disappointing, especially considering
1624800	1629100	that you're playing on a PlayStation. Why can't you just bring in my avatar from home?
1629100	1633660	You know, has this whole system built into it and maybe that's a Sony restriction. I
1633660	1637660	don't know. But it seems a little weird that you can't play with your actual avatars. I
1637660	1641260	tried to play the game online could never find a room full of people to play it with
1641260	1647900	so didn't really get to test that. And I think the questions in the game are really weird.
1647900	1654140	Like it's just only like there's no right. You would think if I'm press your luck on
1654140	1659120	the PlayStation three, I would try to ask a lot of pop culture questions or questions
1659120	1664420	geared towards 20 and 30 somethings. But there's just a lot of like weird off the wall ancient
1664420	1667860	history and obscure sports questions that seem to show up in there and it's kind of
1667860	1672660	like what? Did they just go to a trivia book and yank all this shit out? Like I don't know.
1672660	1677580	Probably what they did. And there's a really weird, like the single player mode is like
1677580	1682980	playing through 16 episodes and your goal is to try and win each episode. But the computer
1682980	1687880	opponents have these different quirks. So yeah, weird. But at the end of the day, the
1687880	1692500	game is only $10. So here's my thought. If you're bringing people over and you want to
1692500	1696820	have laughs and you have three controllers and you want to have a fun little night, this
1696820	1701620	makes for a good board game substitute. I don't think there's any substitute for an
1701620	1705260	awesome board game like clue or monopoly or catan or something like that. But this is
1705260	1708960	a fun little alternative. You know, I don't think it's anything I would take too seriously
1708960	1714100	beyond that. That's, that's basically it for pressure luck. Another game I've been playing
1714100	1717960	this week is Laura Croft and the Guardian of light, which is one of the new games that's
1717960	1722820	on Xbox 360. And I just want to give disclosure a front here. A friend of mine actually worked
1722820	1725740	on this game. So you may want to take what I'm about to say with a grain of salt, but
1725740	1730620	I assure you that bears nothing on my opinion of this game. And if I may say so, it was
1730620	1735460	covered in last month's retro gamer. Was it? But it's not a retro game. It just came out
1735460	1740100	this week. Oh, it must be because of the tomb Raider history or whatever, maybe. And, and
1740100	1745060	there is a certain kind of like retro ish feeling about this game. But, um, as far as
1745060	1748380	the game goes, you know, I still, I, I paid the 15 bucks for it. I played through the
1748380	1755300	demo and, uh, I gotta say it is awesome. I think it is one of the better Xbox live arcade
1755300	1759300	games to come out in a long time. It, here's the thing. It doesn't really feel like tomb
1759300	1762420	Raider at all to me. And I think that's why they're not calling it tomb Raider. They're
1762420	1766660	calling it this Laura Croft game, but I would honestly call it like gauntlet legends is
1766660	1771860	what it feels like more to me. It's more of, and it's very arcade feely with the score
1771860	1776660	and you know, kind of the, the way the maps are in the isometric, but it's, it's, um,
1776660	1780740	it's a good time. Uh, I played through with Alan for about three hours on Friday night.
1780740	1785260	We were just kind of going through the different levels and the, the co-op is a lot of fun.
1785260	1789260	Like some of the puzzles are really cool. Like there's all these different mechanics.
1789260	1794980	Like one of you plays as Laura Croft and she has a grappling hook that she can grab, um,
1794980	1799900	like little, um, I dunno, like little chains with, she can grab them and then grapple over
1799900	1805700	to them. And then, um, you can also play as Totek who is like a, um, Aztec warrior and
1805700	1811100	he can use a shield to either block projectiles or he can use the shield and hold it up. And
1811100	1816620	then Laura can jump on his shield or he can throw spears that then Laura can jump on.
1816620	1821240	So you really have to work together in order to be able to solve these different puzzles.
1821240	1826020	And it actually made for a lot of fun. Um, and we were kind of, you know, every level
1826020	1830140	in that game, it seems to end with this big climactic scene. Like for instance, the end
1830140	1833620	of the first level, you think you're at the end and then all of a sudden the walls start
1833620	1838260	to move and they, they start to move in and it's going to push you over into the pit of
1838260	1842060	spikes if you don't think quickly and you really have to work together. Like you have
1842060	1847300	to jump up, then you have to have Totek throw a spear. You jump on the spear, jump up, use
1847300	1851540	your grappling hook to grab Totek, bring him up. I mean, it's, it sounds complicated the
1851540	1855220	way I'm saying it, but it's, it's all very fluid and, and the way it plays out, it, it
1855220	1858980	executes a lot of fun. And you know, Alan and I are kind of yelling back and forth at
1858980	1862660	each other like, no, no, no, do this, do this, this, you know, and we actually fell on the
1862660	1865600	spikes and died one time cause we didn't have it together. But then we, you know, figured
1865600	1870020	it out the next time. That sounds like the most fun type of game. Those are the ones
1870020	1873100	that Dan and I used to play a lot together. And you know what, the co-op puzzles are done
1873100	1876820	really well. So I think, I think like if you have somebody to sit there and play it with
1876820	1880220	you, it's a lot of fun. I mean, here's one of the drawbacks to Lara Croft and it was
1880220	1885220	in the news because they didn't finish co-op on time or it's not, or buggy or I don't know
1885220	1889180	what happened, but the online co-op isn't there and it's not going to be out till the
1889180	1895420	PlayStation 3 version is out. I don't know the rhyme or reason for that, but honestly
1895420	1899920	I was playing it in house and it was fine and we had a lot of fun. I could see though
1899920	1903060	where it's really lacking, you know, if you had somebody you want to play with, but that'll
1903060	1910300	be fixed in a couple of weeks, I guess. And then the other thing is that, oh, there's
1910300	1914260	something else. There's another drawback I was trying to think of. It seemed like the
1914260	1918420	co-op game is shorter, but I think I just misread some things. So I don't, I don't want
1918420	1923580	to state that right now. I think it is the same length. It just looks weird in the summary.
1923580	1927500	But definitely there's going to be a lot of DLC for the game. But yeah, it's fun.
1927500	1931660	Character models are nice. And single player mode, what they do, they
1931660	1935900	give Laura the spear and then they alter some of the puzzles so that you can still do everything
1935900	1940540	by yourself. And I found myself playing through the first level like seven times this afternoon
1940540	1944580	because there's all these different little mini objectives and one of them is a speed
1944580	1948580	objective. Clear the level as fast as you can. And there are lots of little shortcuts
1948580	1953620	you have to take. One of them is a points objective. Take it slow, kill everything,
1953620	1957980	get all the points, grab the diamonds. So it gives a lot of different reasons to replay
1957980	1962180	the game. So I, I think it's absolutely worth checking out. I think it's one of the better
1962180	1966920	games to come out in a while and makes me excited about Tomb Raider games again, which
1966920	1973100	I never thought I'd say since like 1997. So do you feel all tingly and brand new? I guess
1973100	1976940	so, but I guess they're reinvigorating the regular franchise too. And if it's anything
1976940	1980740	like this, it's going to be awesome. So yeah, I'm, I'm a big fan of Laura Croft and the
1980740	1984020	Guardian of Light. Definitely check out the demo if nothing else. Demo is the first level
1984020	1988980	and I'll give you a, give you a feel for the game. Salacious Pop is in chat and actually
1988980	1994300	says that would give home some purpose. Can't have that. That's in reference to the avatars
1994300	2000880	on a PlayStation three. Press your luck. There you go. All right, chat.orangelandtrady.com

2004300	2008140	housekeeping tonight and then we'll get into some actual gaming news. Housekeeping tonight.
2008140	2011260	We've been talking about a marathon episode. It was brought up last week and we were kind
2011260	2014940	of joking like, should we really do this? We're going to do it. We are going to do a
2014940	2020180	long extended marathon episode of Orange Lounge Radio. It's going to start next week live
2020180	2025740	at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com. It's going to start at two o'clock Pacific, five
2025740	2029740	o'clock Eastern. So it's a little bit earlier than usual. And 10 o'clock in London. That's
2029740	2034380	right. So this also is kind of that those of you overseas that have been wanting to
2034380	2040660	listen, here's your chance. So we're going to go for two to five with our normal show,
2040660	2044420	quote unquote. And then after that, we're going to just keep going into the wee morning
2044420	2047100	hours. We're going to go into the vault. We're going to need some extensions from the mic
2047100	2050420	so we can actually go into the vault, play some old classic games. We're going to field
2050420	2054660	a lot of comments from our chat room and kind of the listeners. We want to know some discussion
2054660	2058900	topics you want us to talk about during that time. We'll be kind of asking you guys. Low
2058900	2061660	Key, unfortunately, because of, you know, the baby and the wife and everything, he's
2061660	2066140	only going to be here for the quote unquote normal show, the first three hours, but he'll
2066140	2073060	be here and then he will be replaced. Low Key's not replaceable, of course, but we'll
2073060	2077820	have, I'm sure Dan will be here. I know Alan plans on being here and who knows what else
2077820	2082300	is actually going to be here on next Sunday to do that. And we plan on going until at
2082300	2088220	least midnight and Dark Soccer seems to think we can go even later. So we'll see. Dark Soccer,
2088220	2094420	how late do you think our marathon show should go? All right. As late as it can. And um,
2094420	2099820	let's see. Rama says, woohoo, time to alcohol down. We are actually thinking about doing
2099820	2104180	at the top of every hour. It's happy hour somewhere and we'll actually take a drink
2104180	2109100	of whatever country it happens to be happy hour in. So tune in. It's going to be a good
2109100	2113420	time. There you go. All right. Um, I think that's it for housekeeping. I don't have a
2113420	2117420	whole lot else. Add us on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange launch radio. We're also on Twitter,
2117420	2121420	twitter.com slash O L R. Visit our website at orange laundry.com. There's been a few
2121420	2126020	forum posts over the past a few weeks that have been nice and so on. Let's get into some
2126020	2130220	actual gaming news now. Loki, what is going on in the gaming world? Uh, lots of stuff
2130220	2136860	this week. I'm starting off and this kind of a little frustrating for me, um, because
2136860	2145480	I was actually, you know, I had the opportunity to participate in this and uh, unfortunately
2145480	2156100	due to, um, emails being eaten by a spam filter, I missed out. I think I could be wrong though.
2156100	2162460	Um, but the connect beta is, um, starting right now. Apparently, um, if you are part
2162460	2169840	of the Microsoft connect program, which I am, um, you get, you know, the occasional
2169840	2174400	survey and beta tests announcements and that kind of stuff. Well, they sent out invites
2174400	2178780	to, um, I'm not sure if it's all the members or some of the members, but, uh, people are
2178780	2184340	getting invites to the connect beta, which they would actually send them a connect motion
2184340	2189940	camera as well as some software to test out and the new dashboard update that's going
2189940	2195120	to be coming out this fall. Um, which includes some other cool stuff, including, um, some
2195120	2200380	audio enhancements and stuff like that. So hopefully that means that, um, everybody doesn't
2200380	2205140	sound like a little kid. It's weird. Like when I was using, um, when sometimes when
2205140	2209640	I'm out sick or something, you know, I have to take time off for my wife or the kid or
2209640	2214240	whatever. Um, and I play against my coworkers at work. They sound like little kids over
2214240	2220580	the mics. Um, even though that's not what they sound like, I'm, you know, in real life.
2220580	2226500	Um, it's just really weird how badly the audio is distorted. So I'm hoping that that actually
2226500	2230180	gets better. Isn't the connect device, doesn't it have a microphone on it too?
2230180	2234260	Um, it does. Yeah, sure. The room noise. So maybe they're doing audio enhancements to
2234260	2238880	kind of better, you know, for the room talking. Like if I'm sitting way back on the couch
2238880	2241760	and connects all the way in the front of the room, like it, it's got to use a different
2241760	2247000	type of sensory. Yes and no. But the reason why they're doing the upgrade to that is before
2247000	2252200	it's kind of like how our radio station was before on live three 65 or even the podcast,
2252200	2257760	how before we were kind of catering towards, you know, low bandwidth, you know, 64 K type
2257760	2263440	stuff now they're updating that because most people have broadband and that's why I see.
2263440	2267540	Okay. Yeah. More bandwidth to play with. So, Oh, you know, it might also be the closure
2267540	2273460	of original Xbox. Uh, that's, that's possible. Um, because it says basically that the basic
2273460	2278560	codec had originally required just a 64 K connection and it's time for us to move on.
2278560	2285520	Um, especially if we want to think about broadening, um, a crackly headset on top of your head,
2285520	2289880	not what people think about when they're talking about popular entertainment. And you know,
2289880	2293600	I agree the audio quality should be better so that I can actually hear what people are
2293600	2299080	saying. Um, instead of just hearing mumbling, cause that's what I hear a lot of times. Yeah.
2299080	2302000	If you go back and listen to old episodes of orange launch radio, I mean they're out
2302000	2305500	there, there's information on the forums. Just remember guys, it was a very different
2305500	2309980	show in 2002. If you go listen to it back when it was dial up friendly radio as we used
2309980	2315640	to call it, you know, it was what, 56 K MP3, no, 24 K MP3 pro or something like that. I
2315640	2320640	don't know what it was. It was, the quality was not very hot if you listen to the recordings
2320640	2325020	from back then and you know, the, the quality has come a long way. So I'm, I'm hoping it'll
2325020	2330620	be just as fast of a difference, uh, over Xbox live. Uh, but basically though the beta
2330620	2335920	testers will be getting, I guess, um, uh, connected ventures, connect sports and connect
2335920	2340140	joy ride, uh, beta versions of those as well. And I do believe there's also a beta version
2340140	2344920	of, uh, dance central as well that's being sent out because, um, it's probably the five
2344920	2350560	song demo that's been, um, yeah, I think it's something similar to that. Uh, so that'd be
2350560	2354440	kind of cool. And those are actually supposed to be sent out now. Um, you should have gotten
2354440	2359480	an email letting you know that's going to happen. I, like I said, I didn't realize that
2359480	2366000	I had gotten this invite way back from like on the eighth. Uh, so I just registered the
2366000	2370360	other day, but I'm crossing my fingers because not everybody that registers gets into it
2370360	2375780	and I've been led into other beta programs. So it would be nice because one, I like getting
2375780	2381600	stuff early and two, I don't want to have to necessarily pay for this. Uh, you know,
2381600	2385800	especially now with the baby and everything, but well, well just in case, Loki, this is
2385800	2393280	for you for missing out. There you go. Thank you for that. You're welcome. Anytime. What
2393280	2397200	are friends for going to our chat room at chat, that orange lounge radio.com. Tiger
2397200	2402080	claw says Microsoft may improve the quality of the voice chat, but still have yet to improve
2402080	2406760	the quality of the people behind the voice. That is true. You will be able to, you will
2406760	2411340	be able to hear all the horrible insults from 12 year olds and high fidelity. Now you can
2411340	2418280	hear F star star K and I star star star F star G and all those wonderful words. No,
2418280	2423480	it'd be awesome though. Cause you know how they have like the really bad, you know, voice
2423480	2428120	dubbing in those like made for TV or not even necessarily made for TV, but how they have
2428120	2432480	the television cable friendly versions of movies and stuff like, you know, the really
2432480	2438840	bad ones where they'll actually like change words to like hotdog or kazoo or some weird
2438840	2443600	ass word. Um, it'd be funny if they had some sort of algorithm to detect what people are
2443600	2447920	saying and to kind of do that on the fly. Ah, I see. Wasn't there a story? I mean, it
2447920	2452480	was some time ago, like a couple of years ago about a patent filed by, I want to say
2452480	2456640	it was Microsoft. It was a long time ago, but I want to say we talked about a story
2456640	2460200	because we had a good laugh at it about that type of technology that it could actually
2460200	2463520	understand the word fuck and it would replace it. And I don't know, like part of me wants
2463520	2466480	to say it came out the next week that it was all a lie. It was a red herring. It was a
2466480	2469960	joke, but I don't know. I want to say that story was out there for some reason. It was
2469960	2473840	a while ago. It would be funny though. Be interesting if this might be the implementation
2473840	2479640	of such technology. I doubt it. Yeah. Uh, let's see. A shadow runner in our chat says
2479640	2484080	people still have dial up. I thought that died and act def says dial up still exists.
2484080	2486980	Believe it or not. You know, a lot of people are still on that. Mike, my parents are still
2486980	2492180	on dial up. They will not switch. They say it's too expensive and like my phone has faster
2492180	2495280	internet than they get at their house. Something else to consider though, you know, a lot
2495280	2499640	of us are spoiled living in big cities out in the rural areas. Not everybody's wild wired
2499640	2503780	for, um, super fast internet. I mean, I think they have like satellite internet and some
2503780	2507840	other like workarounds. Some people live in the woods where everything is interrupted
2507840	2512920	by trees or something else to consider other countries. Like, you know, do you think some
2512920	2520200	countries outside of America, Europe, Japan are as wired for, I guess when I say Europe,
2520200	2524960	I mean Britain and in the surrounding countries. I'm don't, don't send your emails saying Europe
2524960	2530400	is not a country. Um, but you know what I mean? Like a lot of these, those areas are
2530400	2534960	regions of us to say are better wired for internet than others. You know what I mean?
2534960	2540480	Yeah. So if Xbox is going to kind of ramp up the, uh, connection you need, they're kind
2540480	2545000	of given the finger to these people. Really? Because you can't really play on Xbox live
2545000	2552560	with dial up. So who cares? But you can play with like a, can't you play with the satellite
2552560	2556520	link, which isn't, it's faster than dial up, but it's definitely not as fast as cable or
2556520	2561920	even DSL. We may have connection issues cause that's just like playing on our, uh, work,
2561920	2567280	you know, network. It's the connection's not very quick and we get a lot of disconnects
2567280	2573280	with because of that, but it still works when it works. Yeah. Rama in our chat says most
2573280	2579160	ISPs are offering cable modem service for 1999. You know what? I, I probably believe
2579160	2583280	you, I probably should help my parents price this, but I kind of secretly think that my
2583280	2587280	mom is just telling my dad it's too expensive cause she knows that if they buy it, he'll
2587280	2591640	be on the internet all the time. But I'm also thinking my mother is starting to learn how
2591640	2595040	to use the internet and use email. So why wouldn't she want faster internet? I don't
2595040	2598600	know. I guess you'll have to ask them. So there you go. Anything else about the connect
2598600	2602160	program? Loki, anything else to know? I mean, this is just around the corner at this point,
2602160	2605640	right? About two months away. Um, well the connected, yeah, it's coming out November
2605640	2611200	4th. The actual, um, devices will be out, you know, soon as Microsoft sends them out.
2611200	2614560	Let me ask this question. Why are they doing a beta program for this? It seems weird because
2614560	2618920	you, we haven't heard of a lot of hardware beta tests. I mean, the last one I can remember
2618920	2624720	is the PlayStation two hard drive for Final Fantasy 11, but I don't hear this a lot. It's
2624720	2631160	really kind of unusual for them to be doing a lot of these. I would think it just word
2631160	2636360	of mouth maybe, um, getting people excited about it. You know, they're, there's, you
2636360	2642240	know, a vast amount of NDA, you know, items on there. They're basically not wanting people
2642240	2647840	to share, you know, what's included in the new dashboard update and all this stuff. But
2647840	2652880	people talk anyways and I think that they realize that and it's just kind of like, you
2652880	2656440	know, Ooh, information I'm not supposed to know. I'm more interested now, you know, instead
2656440	2664760	of just, I don't know. So the whole thing is just a marketing thing. Or I mean, but
2664760	2668120	I'm sure at the same time though, there is like some troubleshooting stuff that they're
2668120	2672760	probably doing. Um, you know, just seeing, Hey, are there any bugs that we haven't thought
2672760	2677640	of yet that maybe are in this that we could patch day one or something. Um, you know,
2677640	2682880	that kind of stuff. But I'm curious how well that video chat works. I just want one. That's
2682880	2687440	all because I was actually kind of interested in the connect stuff, the move I could care
2687440	2693380	less about, but you know, it would be kind of fun. I would like to try out dance masters
2693380	2697840	before it comes out. So I don't look like a total tool trying to play the game. Good
2697840	2707080	luck with that. I mean, you know, it's all, yes, I understand. Yeah, there's a lot of
2707080	2712240	the thing is when you look at choreographed dancing, um, it looks stupid if one person's
2712240	2715860	doing it. If a bunch of people are doing it at the same time, it looks cool because it's
2715860	2723480	all in sync. But when one person's doing it, it's not so cool. You mean or paradise? Exactly.
2723480	2726980	Like one person playing that game usually looked a little bit ridiculous, but when everybody
2726980	2730560	would stand behind the machine doing the same dance, like people would walk up like, how
2730560	2737760	do they know that? What do they do? What? It's a cult. That game is a cult. It's a trap.
2737760	2741120	Yeah. So that, that's the thing. You know, they're going to have like the routines from
2741120	2746840	like the music videos for some of these songs and yeah, it'll be kind of cool. Um, you would
2746840	2753000	have a bunch of people doing it, but can you imagine a bunch of sober people doing this
2753000	2756800	together? I can't imagine that. I'll, all I can imagine is, Hey, I'm going to play dance
2756800	2760840	masters and everyone going, ha, you look stupid or you know, what's going to be awesome is
2760840	2765120	learning on dance central. Let's say like how to dance to poker face central. I mean,
2765120	2770020	not dance masters, dance masters look stupid. Well, whatever. But like, let's say like you
2770020	2774520	learned the dance to, I don't know, poker face on dance central and like you and like
2774520	2778080	five year friends, I'll learn this dance and then you all go out to the club and when that
2778080	2781760	song comes on, you can all just start doing the dance. You're going to look weird. Well,
2781760	2786580	no, no. And people are going to look like you, you may look, but here's the thing though.
2786580	2790120	If you're all doing at the same time, it actually might look kind of cool. And people in clubs,
2790120	2794640	you know, they're kind of drunk anyways, so it doesn't matter. Um, no, but now, now if
2794640	2799320	you take a hilarious flash mobbing, it would be kind of cool. I mean, cause people, especially
2799320	2802680	if you have a bunch of hot chicks with you, no one's going to care. Um, you know, but
2802680	2807440	if you do what you learn and say dance masters in a club, people are going to think you're
2807440	2815800	a fucking idiot because it looks like Para. And unless you go to a club in Japan, I think
2815800	2819040	anytime you have a group of three or more, all doing the same thing, no matter what it
2819040	2827000	is, like in sync, it's going to be like interesting. I think it is weird. I mean, at least piece.
2827000	2831320	It kind of reminds me of when I used to go to the club long time ago. Um, there was a
2831320	2836140	guy that looked like he, it was literally like some grandpa dressed up like Michael
2836140	2840520	Jackson doing stuff. And it didn't matter what he was doing. It's interesting because
2840520	2845280	you're like, that's something I don't see every day. And that's the other thing too.
2845280	2849800	I mean, it'll get people's attention and really going to clubs. That's all what it's about.
2849800	2854280	It's getting people's attention because you know, that's what you crave. I don't know
2854280	2858160	how often you've been to gay bars, Loki, but there's, that's, that's like all the people
2858160	2863000	there on the dance floor, all that old man in the thriller outfit. Like I can think of
2863000	2870380	like, it takes a lot to stand out like that at a gay bar. It really does. Like the one
2870380	2875200	I remember is this fierce old drag queen that used to wear like a leotard looking like Jane
2875200	2883440	Fonda out of the 1980s. They used to do like goth dancing to pop songs. That was unique.
2883440	2890040	That is unique. That's a, that was genres right there. That's right. It was, it was,
2890040	2897960	well, you know, America's the melting pot. So that sounds Rob. That sounds divine. Yes.
2897960	2904000	Yes. There will be interested in, in like dance central because look at how well, um,
2904000	2908200	just dance did. I mean that came out with like fucking nowhere. Just dance at the top
2908200	2912920	of the charts for like weeks. It's still, you know, a really popular Wii game. Where
2912920	2917040	the hell did that come from? So you know, if that has that kind of popularity and we
2917040	2923280	get the kind of support from, um, you know, harmonics with this, it'll be awesome. So
2923280	2927960	we'll just have to wait, which if they're given money, you know, they will. Yes. I'm
2927960	2934320	hoping the support's awesome. On the other hand, dance masters, Konami promises download
2934320	2940520	content, but I have yet to see them actually come through with the download. We'll see.
2940520	2944600	You never know. Yeah. One thing I've been checking out, I upgraded my iPhone. Finally
2944600	2948620	I have one of the fours now and uh, I checked out like the DDR apps actually run smoothly
2948620	2953320	on the iPhone four. Now I was looking at DDR S plus the iPhone one and it's basically just
2953320	2957320	nothing but microtransactions, but there's a lot of songs in there and a lot of current
2957320	2961840	songs too. Like just dance by lady Gaga. You can't touch this by MC hammer and you know,
2961840	2965540	funny throwbacks like that. It does have a pretty extensive song library. I gotta say
2965540	2970200	I was, I was surprised cause I was expecting the library to be nothing but the same old
2970200	2975200	damn songs from fourth mix, fifth mix, max, max to extreme, you know, all the same old
2975200	2980080	songs, but it wasn't. There's a lot of different stuff in there. Kind of neat. Well I know
2980080	2985200	you can't touch this is actually in DDR X and I think just dance might be in one of
2985200	2990240	the newer probably are from other DDR games, but I was just surprised that they were licenses
2990240	2994240	no matter what it is. They, they are commercial. You know, they are still coming out with a
2994240	2997520	dance dance revolution. Remember how they were going back to dance dance revolution
2997520	3002760	to make it really confusing for the PS3 and the Wii. It's the move one. Oh, they're, they're
3002760	3005640	different games. Dance Dance Revolution on the Wii is just, it's an extension of hottest
3005640	3009600	party and they're not saying it, but it's, it's the same old like balance board mode
3009600	3013440	and all that stuff. And then the one on the PS3 is the move and then the 360 is not getting
3013440	3018400	DDR. It's getting dance masters. That's how it's working. Yeah, there it is. All right.
3018400	3021400	Hope you wrote down what I said really fast. If you need an explanation and something you
3021400	3025720	could use to write down real fast is a peripheral we talked about last week on the show. The
3025720	3030920	U-Draw. Remember this? Nice segue. Yeah, it's awesome, huh? The U-Draw was the third party
3030920	3035320	tablet that they were, I believe THQ was making it to do like a Pictionary game and there's
3035320	3038640	another game that they were making with this. Well, Dude's Adventure and then there's also
3038640	3042120	some actual drawing game that comes with the tablet. I'm glad someone was paying attention
3042120	3047320	last week. All right, well, there's a rumor out this week and it's being run on gonintendo.com,
3047320	3051120	which you know, they, they love their Nintendo over there. I guess they have a tipster who
3051120	3055100	says they have inside info on the U-Draw and I'm thinking if I'm Go Nintendo, I don't run
3055100	3059320	with this unless I know that there is some clout to this. You know, they've been around
3059320	3066500	a little while. So, here's the quote. Both games, talking about Nintendo themselves getting
3066500	3071840	into making games for the U-Draw, are designed with the mass market gamer in mind, yet honor
3071840	3076620	the passion of traditional gamers. And of course, one of the huge speculations right
3076620	3081200	off the bat, Mario Paint. Finally, a new Mario Paint on the Wii. Could it really be happening?
3081200	3087600	That'd be awesome. The Go Nintendo also speculates Kirby Canvas Curse, perhaps. Although, honestly,
3087600	3090960	insert any DS game here, they can make an adaptation for it. I don't know if they would
3090960	3095120	do another Kirby game that soon after Kirby's Epic Yarn, but. But if they're making it now,
3095120	3098640	it probably wouldn't be out until next Christmas, right? I want a Mario Paint and I want the
3098640	3102280	music mode. I think a Mario Paint would be great, although I believe it's one of those
3102280	3106640	games you sort of see through retro colored glasses where it was awesome when you were
3106640	3112640	12, but now it's... But the music mode was pretty rad. And there's still like a cultish
3112640	3117360	community for that. Imagine if they... There's an emulator for just the music mode. Okay,
3117360	3122960	imagine if they brought back Mario Paint. Just... Call this a dream game if you want,
3122960	3127600	but just... This is... If Nintendo knew what they were doing... Maybe this could be a segment
3127600	3131440	on the show. If Nintendo knew what they were doing, what would happen to Mario Paint? Here,
3131440	3138320	let me help you with that. Yeah. Free help, free advice. They would bring back the Mario
3138320	3143560	music mode, but what they would do is they would really cash in on this whole chiptune
3143560	3147920	thing that's being made big again with the Scott Pilgrim game, and you know, chiptunes
3147920	3153320	are just kind of in right now. And a lot of the little symbols would make chiptune-y type
3153320	3159240	of noises, and it would be really easy in Mario Paint Wii to make chiptune sounds. And
3159240	3162840	they would still have some of the dumb stuff, like the cats meowing and the dogs barking
3162840	3167440	that people make songs out of, but if they really wanted to make a really thorough chiptune...
3167440	3172000	And when I say thorough, I mean it's still easy to use like the old Mario Paint was,
3172000	3176840	but it has a lot of options. I think there's a big cash cow there for that. And then imagine,
3176840	3180940	again, if Nintendo knew what they were doing, you could upload to the internet and share
3180940	3187080	with other people. What a concept. What a concept! Or publish... I know this might be
3187080	3193440	hard to imagine, but if Nintendo knew what they were doing, if you put an SD card...
3193440	3196880	And there's obviously a joke here, because Nintendo is the number one system. They do
3196880	3201080	know what they're doing in some regards, but you know, if Nintendo wanted to make me happy,
3201080	3206120	you have those SD cards that you can put in the slot on the Wii. Imagine if the chiptune
3206120	3210280	music-making mode in this hypothetical Mario Paint game that I've completely made up, you
3210280	3215200	could export MP3s to the SD card. Oh my god. It wouldn't be MP3s. Oh my god. It would be
3215200	3222200	AAC files because, remember, they don't support MP3s anymore. Okay, fine. AACs then. Still.
3222200	3227120	Still. It would be amazing. It would be very amazing. And then while you're at it, you
3227120	3232760	release a DS version, or a DSi version that comes out as well, where not only can you
3232760	3239120	draw stuff, but you can take pictures of things and then, you know, edit them and do all that
3239120	3243860	fun stuff. Alright, well, what do you guys think the other game could possibly be? Mario
3243860	3247680	Paint, I think, is the number one fanboy request. What would be the other one? If you were making
3247680	3255680	a game for UDraw in a Nintendo franchise, what do you think it could be? Magic Pen Jell.
3255680	3262080	It's not Nintendo franchise. That'd be awesome. Maybe if Nintendo made an RPG or something
3262080	3268320	like that. I don't think I played... That game was so sweet. Graffiti Kingdom, I remember
3268320	3272040	that came out, that was pretty awesome too, but I didn't play that very much. I'm gonna
3272040	3281360	say the other drawing game is a generic Wii blank game. Like, Wii Party, Wii Sports, Wii...
3281360	3285000	One of those, what's the island called now that they have all these games on, and the
3285000	3289400	Wii Fit? There's gonna be a Wii Draw. That's the other Nintendo game. It's just Wii Draw.
3289400	3292760	Of course, then again, that would just be Mario Paint, wouldn't it? So maybe that's
3292760	3296320	what you're getting instead of Mario Paint. What if they had it where you can play Pikmin
3296320	3300760	on it or something like that? Ah, now you're talking. Or like an RTS of some sort. Recreation
3300760	3308080	of the stylus. Like with DS games. Imagine how much easier, by the way, playing Cooking
3308080	3314880	Mama on the Wii would be. With a U-Draw. Yeah. Perhaps. Well, you know, it's not Cooking
3314880	3319380	Mama anymore, it's Crafting Mama. That's the next one. The other thing I wanted to say
3319380	3323680	about this real quick, isn't it weird though that you have a first party person supporting
3323680	3329160	a third party device? Like, if Nintendo was planning on making games for this, wouldn't
3329160	3334240	they just suddenly say, maybe we want to buy this and make it a first party peripheral?
3334240	3337800	Like it seems weird to me that THQ is putting this out, but Nintendo is supporting it. These
3337800	3341280	things are supposed to work in reverse. Um, not necessarily, because they could just team
3341280	3345600	up with them and have it actually where they release the peripheral. It'll probably be
3345600	3349600	bundled with one of their games. Like if they came out with a Mario Paint, for example,
3349600	3354920	it would be bundled with the U-Draw tablet. It's just, you know, made by third parties.
3354920	3361920	It's kind of like, um, well, I don't know. There's not really anything out there that's
3362320	3369000	kind of like that right now, where there's supporting a, you know, third party device.
3369000	3374560	That's what I'm saying. But hey, whatever. There's a first for everything. I guess that's
3374560	3378960	true. Okay, Dark Sakura, speaking of firsts, she hasn't gotten to give us a news story
3378960	3385640	tonight yet. I know! Okay, how about some stuff for Red Dead Redemption? AKA Grand Theft
3385640	3391560	Horse. And I hate that these stupid ads on the site decide that they want to completely
3391560	3397160	cover the entire page and not give me the little button to close the damn thing. There.
3397160	3402600	Anyway, um, this is for Red Dead Redemption, the Liars and Cheats pack has a date in the
3402600	3410080	UK. And for the PS3 and 360, it will be released on the 21st of September. It'll be £7.99
3410080	3420200	on PlayStation Network and 800 Microsoft Points. That's roughly 9.60 in Euros. So, um, it was
3420200	3424920	going to be free, but they've decided to make it super nice and then they can give away
3424920	3431000	free packs. So, anyway, it's going to have different multiplayer modes, one called Stronghold,
3431000	3439080	where you take turns as attack and defense, multiplayer horse races, poker, liar's dice,
3439080	3447360	an explosive rifle, gang hideouts, hunting grounds, and 15 of the characters in story
3447360	3457200	mode will be playable character skins. So that's cool. So, Loki, you play a lot of Grand
3457200	3461040	Theft Auto at work, and Dark Soccer made a joke calling it Grand Theft Horse. Why do
3461040	3465360	you think Red Dead Redemption hasn't caught on with your little crowd? Well, we did. We
3465360	3471200	play that sometimes. It's just we don't have four copies of it. We only have three. So
3471200	3475080	we don't really play. And the thing about Red Dead Redemption that doesn't really work
3475080	3480000	too well for a multiplayer is, I mean, the free mode stuff is kind of fun, but if you
3480000	3485280	want to do deathmatch, you have to basically go to a deathmatch location on the map and
3485280	3489320	then you have to trigger it and invite your other people in there. And if it's anything
3489320	3494400	like the times we've tried to set up before, the game's really dumb as far as setting up
3494400	3500620	games. Like, for example, we set up a deathmatch one time, and I invited everybody. They accepted.
3500620	3504360	It started loading the game, and then we ended up in the three separate deathmatches where
3504360	3509840	we were the only player there. I was like, what the hell? So that's why we don't play
3509840	3517240	Red Dead Redemption right now. We've been just playing Grand Theft Auto. It's fun to
3517240	3522280	stick with. Plus, they're really itching for me to get the mod game back up again so we
3522280	3527920	can play that again, because that was some of the best games we've ever played. And the
3527920	3533480	best part about it is, the guy that made one of the mod tools, OpenIV, they have a beta
3533480	3537820	version that's out there now that I signed up for the beta for that, and the new version
3537820	3543420	allows us to edit the files for Red Dead Redemption. Ah, make your own expansion pack. But it's
3543420	3548120	a very different format, so that's something I need to explore. I have to dump it to my
3548120	3556320	hard drive first, but it'll be interesting to check that out. I also had another bit
3556320	3562520	for this story as well. For Red Dead Redemption, there's a rumor going around that they're
3562520	3567360	casting for the movie and asked to Brad Pitt. Wow, I just saw that comment from Tiger Claw
3567360	3571200	in our chat room, too. It was saying that at chat.orangehunter.com, he said, oh yeah,
3571200	3574320	you heard that Brad Pitt might star in a Red Dead Redemption movie. Why does that sound
3574320	3581000	like fanboy wank to me? It sounds like fanboy wank to me. Well, according to this, they've
3581000	3587920	given him first refusal on it, so, I don't know. You know, I also heard, I saw on Live
3587920	3594120	Journal or somewhere that apparently they cast, what's his name from Lost, Matthew Fox
3594120	3597560	as the main guy in Mass Effect, which I guess they're making an actual movie out of. And
3597560	3601920	I looked at that and I said, boy, that sounds like fanboy wank. I didn't even know they
3601920	3604640	were gonna make a legitimate Mass Effect movie. I thought they would wait until the trilogy
3604640	3612000	is done. But maybe they're gonna try to release it at the same time? I don't know. Well, I
3612000	3617080	have to check and see. I didn't read the show roll all the way yet, but there was another
3617080	3625320	movie thing, I don't remember if we're talking about it or not. I don't think so. I don't
3625320	3630800	think so. If we spoil it, we spoil it, oops. And whatever, okay, so it's that, and honestly,
3630800	3635260	I am not familiar with this series because I don't own an iPhone or something like that,
3635260	3641600	but was it Big Angry Bird or something like that? Oh yeah, I've heard of Angry Birds.
3641600	3649360	So they're supposed to be making a movie out of that. That sounds dumb, but I don't know.
3649360	3654040	Interesting. I don't know what kind of game you'd make out of that, but whatever. I think
3654040	3659360	what it's come down to is the movie industry is really hurting for original ideas, so now
3659360	3665520	they're trying to just develop everything into a movie. And a perfect example of that
3665520	3672920	is the whole Hasbro licensing with the Ouija game, or Ouija game, the movie, or Battleship
3672920	3678240	the movie, or Monopoly the movie. They did Ouija the movie, it was called The Exorcist.
3678240	3682860	Or this nonsense that they're remaking Clue, the movie. They're not remaking the 80s version
3682860	3687280	of Clue, which will always be a timeless classic. Oh no, yeah. They're just gonna make a new
3687280	3692960	movie based off of Clue that'll be, I'm sure it's wonderful, the piece of cinema is the
3692960	3697280	Clue 2 murder and disguise VCR game where you get to see Mr. Green dressed up as Madame
3697280	3707280	Rose. It was quality cinema. So yeah, it's just terrible ideas right now. It's very unfortunate.
3707280	3713720	So yes, last week we talked a little bit about a possible Playstation 3 mod chip, which apparently
3713720	3725440	is real. And it is being dealt with swiftly by Sony as well. It was confirmed, I guess,
3725440	3730400	by a bunch of different sources that, you know, despite the fact that one video showed
3730400	3738080	it running on a dev console, it is actually the real deal. It's actually sold out as well.
3738080	3743960	And of course, it goes without saying that Sony, they say they have a way to detect whether
3743960	3751400	you're running it or not, and they will ban you. So buyer beware, I suppose. And apparently
3751400	3758600	the device is kind of similar to the Pandora battery that was on the PSP. They're not sure
3758600	3763740	if they can actually block the device from working with a software update. They may actually
3763740	3773240	have to change the way the hardware is made in order to block the device from working.
3773240	3780960	And Sony has actually, Sony Australia has granted a temporary injunction by the federal
3780960	3786520	court to block the importation and sale of the new mod chips as well. It is a temporary
3786520	3795240	injunction means until August 31st. So during that time, actually Sony will have, I guess,
3795240	3799060	they're the only ones that they can be sold to, and I'm not sure if they actually get
3799060	3801440	to seize the hardware or whatever.
3801440	3805620	But that's just, like this device wasn't made in Australia, right?
3805620	3812140	This isn't made in Australia, but Oz Mod Chips was one of the first, you know, first mod
3812140	3819200	chip reseller that has, you know, had these chips. So, I don't know, it puts, I guess
3819200	3824560	it blocks something. You know, we'll see, August 31st is like, what, a couple days away,
3824560	3830680	so it might just be, you know, especially if they aren't granted an extension on that,
3830680	3835900	you better believe that they're going to kick that shit out of the door immediately, so.
3835900	3840200	Or you could just import one from the US, Canada, Switzerland, right?
3840200	3845200	Exactly, so. Unless, unless, and I don't know, unless maybe they were the first ones to get
3845200	3850620	it, and then those companies are buying it from Oz Mod Chips, who knows.
3850620	3855920	And so of course, yeah, the, basically the temporary injunction does halt the sale to
3855920	3866320	anyone but Sony. Apparently, they are legally forced to sell the PS jail breaks to Sony,
3866320	3871880	and in any case, they, I guess they have a chance to figure out how the thing works in
3871880	3876760	the meantime. I'm sure that they could buy one anyways. They probably will try to figure
3876760	3881760	out how it works. And if anything, it probably works very similar to the way their, I guess,
3881760	3887840	dev kit stuff works. And then of course, the reason why they're trying to, or they got
3887840	3892660	the temporary injunction anyways, is saying that apparently the device uses some sort
3892660	3898320	of code that's from the dev, you know, dev kit or something like that, that, you know,
3898320	3905580	is proprietary and that, you know, it's violating whatever. Of course, the, whoever is making
3905580	3911760	these chips actually are saying that they don't use any of that stuff, and they aren't
3911760	3916720	too worried by what's going on. They're saying, you know, there was kind of a short back and
3916720	3926320	forth Q&A with them. It says, companies in Australia get a lot of problems. Sony halts
3926320	3931680	Australian resellers. Is this a big problem? And it says it's a temporary injunction until
3931680	3938720	August 31st. Will be reached then. Nothing illegal has been done. It's just a scare tactic.
3938720	3943520	And it says there's no copyright code and we have not interfered with any intellectual
3943520	3950120	property laws. The device is designed for homebrew. Nothing illegal. I guess you can
3950120	3957040	say nothing illegal, but yeah, obviously it can be used both ways. The product is very
3957040	3963480	different from every other mod. Nothing illegal. Once again, they, you know, reinforcing that.
3963480	3969640	Yes, but all these shops, returning customers, money back, people informed saying the order
3969640	3974360	is canceled. It says it's just a scare tactic. It's obviously working. It will work in Europe
3974360	3982480	also. Then everyone will be missing out on lots of profits. Too bad for everyone who
3982480	3991760	gets scared easily. The strong ones will make out more now. And it says, yes, technically
3991760	3998460	shops do not know anything or know how the USB 6 works. Boot code or something like that
3998460	4002960	because of this, people are scared and think that they can't win. We don't want to take
4002960	4007880	the risk. Um, but you understand, you see, um, nothing, there's nothing to be scared
4007880	4011520	about. No copyright infringement, no your affairs. They sound very foreign because it's
4011520	4018960	very broken English, but we'll see. Um, like I said, I have one on order for the hell of
4018960	4024360	it because I like to get everything, especially stuff that people don't want me to have. And
4024360	4030480	uh, nice rationale, whatever, you know, I don't have to, you know, justify it. I spend
4030480	4036040	plenty of money on games. Um, and then, so I have one on order and I'm not worried about
4036040	4041520	it cause you know, like they said, you know, if, if for some reason Sony does put some
4041520	4046380	permanent injunction, if you know, prevents them from selling it, I get my money back.
4046380	4052560	If they don't, I get a mod chip. I don't see how I lose out in this scenario. So it's not
4052560	4057560	a big deal. All right. Well, I don't know if the jailbreak will help out with this situation
4057560	4061280	if it's adopted by Sony, but it's something that's becoming more and more popular. We've
4061280	4066240	talked about it quite at length on this show. It's the online pass. Yeah. You remember that?
4066240	4071720	Uh, it's showing up in the EA sports games now and I think THQ Ubisoft supposedly is
4071720	4076200	putting this on board. Um, and if you don't remember what the online pass is, it's where
4076200	4083360	you pay $10 if you buy the game used for like a code so that you can actually play the game
4083360	4088800	online and unlock other features. Um, it's locked out if you don't have the code. Obviously
4088800	4093400	if you buy the game new, it comes with a code. Well guess what company is supposedly getting
4093400	4099360	on board? Sony. That's right. Sony themselves for their first party games. This is a comment
4099360	4103560	from a Sony computer entertainment Europe, Andrew House quote on the principle of making
4103560	4108160	online portions of the game available or unlocked from the disc base released for a fee. We're
4108160	4114920	broadly supportive of that and we're exploring actively the same option for our own content.
4114920	4120360	Because of mod chips like this. I mean, think about that. That's one way. Well, we'll prevent
4120360	4126000	people from getting online because they will have access to a code to get online. Therefore,
4126000	4132740	you know, enticing people to buy games. Now, of course this story made rounds all over
4132740	4136240	the internet because, you know, here in Sony is going to jump on board, gets, you know,
4136240	4141280	people's ears perked. But I like this particular perspective on it that was on Destructoid.
4141280	4144500	One of their authors over there when they ran the story said this, I thought this was
4144500	4149680	very good. Again, this is from Destructoid.com. Quote, it seems that this is most certainly
4149680	4154280	the future of online play. Buy new or pay for it. I still think it's ludicrous. The
4154280	4158680	industry relies more on trading credit than I think any publisher will want to admit.
4158680	4162280	And if trade in values are diminished because of this, well, good luck trying to compete
4162280	4166320	in an already competitive market when gamers find themselves even less able to afford your
4166320	4172980	$60 luxuries and sums it up with this. The author does. If used games disappeared tomorrow,
4172980	4180560	the market would crash. I guarantee it. I think that's true. Um, he makes an interesting point.
4180560	4185640	I it's, it's, it's a really interesting point. Well, it is an interesting point and here,
4185640	4190440	here's my point to it right now. As of right now, the stuff that they seem to be targeting
4190440	4195440	is sports games. You know, I don't know if you should, if you're a sports game or if
4195440	4198800	you should take offense to that because really they're the ones that they seem to be targeting
4198800	4205560	because right now it's just UFC 2010, the, uh, Tiger Woods, you know, or Tiger Woods
4205560	4213380	2011, NCAA 11, Madden 11, um, and then of course, um, Smackdown versus Raw 11. Those
4213380	4217100	are all, if you would consider sports titles right now. And they're also talking that this
4217100	4221960	is going to be done in, I guess, MLB, the show 11. It's interesting that you say that
4221960	4226640	because Raman, our chat room at chat.orangelandstrategy.com says, I have no problem with the online pass
4226640	4231320	since they're just for sports games. Once it passes to non sports games, then I'll have
4231320	4236720	a problem with it. Um, it seems to me there's different types of gamers too. You know, you
4236720	4242240	have, um, you have people that buy their systems, their consoles, and this is a significant
4242240	4249120	amount of people for nothing but Madden, NBA, and a lot of those games that Loki named save
4249120	4254880	for the occasional Halo, Call of Duty, and those types of, of mega games. And then you
4254880	4258160	have kind of the gamers, like I think the majority of the people that listen to our
4258160	4263560	show that like to play some of the more gamer oriented titles that really have nothing to
4263560	4267460	do with sports games. And of course there's some crossover as I'm not saying none of you
4267460	4271440	like to play sports games. Even I like Double Dribble and Blades of Steel and some of those
4271440	4275920	old school sports games. But you know what I mean. Like, you know, there, there definitely
4275920	4281200	is kind of two factions of gaming if you will. So it is interesting that only this one seems
4281200	4285880	to be impacted so far by this. Um, and something I would like to add, it was a story that didn't
4285880	4292600	make our show roll, but I thought it was very ballsy of them to be, you know, making this
4292600	4299160	sort of argument. But THQ basically called people that buy used games cheaters. Like
4299160	4305760	they're cheating, you know, the devs out of, you know, their hard earned money or something.
4305760	4306760	That's ridiculous.
4306760	4310220	That's just kind of an ignorant argument. Like I re- I'm trying to see where they're
4310220	4316600	coming from, but that's very ignorant to the world we live in because like, does Paramount
4316600	4322540	Pictures and 20th Century Fox say that about used DVD sales and used Blu-ray sales and
4322540	4329360	a lot of the used- I mean, what is a garage sale? Is a garage sale a cheating party? Like
4329360	4333520	just, I mean, selling your old shit is a part of American culture.
4333520	4338440	Here's what I don't understand that they're complaining anyways because, here's the thing.
4338440	4343920	When they've sold it to their retailer, they've already sold their copies to the retailer,
4343920	4347880	they have their money, it's up to the retailer to decide, hey, if people are buying used
4347880	4352560	copies, then, you know, that sucks for me because I still have this new copy on the
4352560	4356800	shelf or something like that. But I don't under- it's dumb.
4356800	4362980	Basically anyways, THQ's Corey Ledesma basically said, I don't think we really care whether
4362980	4369380	used game buyers are upset because the new game buyers get everything. He says, so if
4369380	4373800	used game buyers are upset that they don't get online features set, I don't really have
4373800	4380100	much sympathy for them. That's a little blunt, but we hope it doesn't disappoint people.
4380100	4387200	We hope that people understand that when the games bought used, we get cheated.
4387200	4390840	I don't see how you get cheated because there's still the same amount of people playing your
4390840	4397360	damn game that there were before. You know, I don't understand how that you're cheated.
4397360	4401400	And if anything, say someone buys it used and they like it, then they go out and buy
4401400	4405600	it in the next version. Say, you know, I bought Saints Row One used or something like that,
4405600	4409000	and I'm like, whoa, this is an awesome game. And Saints Row Two comes out, I buy it new
4409000	4412800	day one. I don't understand how they lose out on this, but I'll tell you something,
4412800	4419320	I'm not fucking buying your sports games, so whatever. And I'll tell you why, man. I'll
4419320	4422800	think twice about buying your other games if you have this kind of crap.
4422800	4425080	Or the U-Draw, which we talked about earlier in the show.
4425080	4428200	Well, the U-Draw's not going to have that because Wii doesn't really do online stuff
4428200	4434000	too much, and that's not really what they're going after, but it's still retarded to think
4434000	4435000	that-
4435000	4436200	It's still, it's the same company.
4436200	4441000	And they've made excuses left and right, and you know, oh, we get cheated out of stuff.
4441000	4444880	Well, wait a second, you get cheated because you're not selling a new copy, and so you're
4444880	4448200	trying to entice people to buy new copies? But I thought before you were saying that
4448200	4452200	you needed this extra money to support your online services that you're now providing
4452200	4457600	extra options for. Oh, wait, but now you're just saying that it's because, you know, all
4457600	4463400	these U-Sails are really cutting into your profits. Be glad you're selling copies at
4463400	4467400	all, because if you keep this kind of attitude up, you know, hey, let me tell you this much,
4467400	4469400	it hasn't helped Activision too much.
4469400	4475900	Uh, gotta go to our chatroom, chat.orangessontrady.com. Rama just kind of takes one glove off and
4475900	4481400	slaps THQ across the face, saying, no, the companies that market the games at $59.99
4481400	4482400	are cheaters.
4482400	4486800	And, and the other thing too, is on top of all that stuff, calling these people cheaters
4486800	4491100	and stuff, and you're putting out these sports games, and I don't want to make generic, you
4491100	4496300	know, I don't want to put out generic opinions of these sports games, but a lot of people
4496300	4500100	kind of agreed that a lot of times these are just kind of roster updates that they put
4500100	4501200	out each year, and...
4501200	4506000	Well, to be fair, it's the way that that faction looks at music games.
4506000	4510300	Exactly. And, and don't get me wrong, I mean, a lot of music games out there, especially
4510300	4516400	the Guitar Freak series, is just a different song list each year, and, and that's it. But
4516400	4523600	I mean, there isn't, it's not like, you know, vast improvements between each game, and the
4523600	4527700	fact that they're saying, oh, well, we want you to pay extra money for this, oh, and then
4527700	4530700	we have this download content that could have been added in there for free, but, you know,
4530700	4534700	we want a little bit more money, and oh, now you bought it used, so now you have to pay
4534700	4535700	for online access.
4535700	4540400	But guess what, you know? Maybe the used players will learn not to really give a shit about
4540400	4545100	the online access. Then what are you gonna do? Oh, look, they bought all your used games,
4545100	4548700	you're still getting cheated, and they're not buying your stupid, you know, internet
4548700	4549700	access.
4549700	4553100	Let me get to other chatroom comments. ActDeaf in our chatroom says, don't know, the used
4553100	4557900	DVDs and Blu-ray market ain't that big. Keep in mind, he's in another country, so I, I
4557900	4563400	don't know if, if that changes the perspective. I mean, I think if there's a store here that
4563400	4566100	does nothing but sell used DVDs and, and that sort of thing.
4566100	4571400	I can, I can tell you right now that the, the studios don't like used sales, because
4571400	4576300	at one time we were buying, because you know, Redbox and stuff, they have, they turn over
4576300	4580900	their DVDs quite quick, and they have to offload all that used product. Well, we used to buy
4580900	4586100	it, and then turn around and sell it. They don't care for that too much, but it, you
4586100	4591200	know, it's still legal practice, but they, what they do now is they make them destroy
4591200	4597400	their product after all these deals that they have in place with the vendors. But they don't
4597400	4600700	care for it too much, but it doesn't really impact them too much. They kind of blame piracy
4600700	4605500	over, you know, any, a few movies used, but okay. Maybe, maybe it's just because we have
4605500	4608500	this handy-dandy store near me that it makes it really easy.
4608500	4612500	Um, Akdeft goes on to say, they're cheated out of the money they should have supposed
4612500	4617400	to get with the sale of the new game. Uh, let's see, Rama says, I'm sorry, THQ, wrestling
4617400	4622600	games are not sports games, since WWE and so on is sports entertainment. Satellite Minded
4622600	4627200	says, people are already paying to play games online. Why do they have to pay more for content
4627200	4633300	that's on the disc? And Tiger Claw says, it all comes down to one word, greed.
4633300	4641100	And I agree, and you know what? Um, it's kind of funny though, like, if Microsoft did this,
4641100	4645400	I think there would be a shit storm, you know, because people are already paying for online
4645400	4650100	access and they'd be like, why the fuck do I got to pay for more online access?
4650100	4651600	That's probably why they don't.
4651600	4656200	It's probably smart to do this. It's probably like, let's see how it plays out over there.
4656200	4661100	It's not a popular idea. Um, I just don't think it's necessary. If you want to make
4661100	4665500	your, here's what you need to do. It's so simple, and you know, a lot of times they're
4665500	4672300	doing it already, but all you got to do is just sell download content, you know? You
4672300	4676700	don't even necessarily have to, you know, cut stuff out of your game, but just support
4676700	4679900	it with download content and you'll make a lot of money back, whether they bought it
4679900	4683900	new or used. If they bought it new, great, you make that sale and you make additional
4683900	4689600	money, but if they bought it used, they're still buying download content. And I don't
4689600	4693700	see how you lose out of that because that's digital. It's pure profit, pretty much.
4693700	4698700	Alright, let's move on. We spent a lot of time on this topic. We've got a lot more stories
4698700	4703200	to cover. Speaking of legal things, I believe Dark Sakura's got a more legally oriented
4703200	4707100	story for us. They could also be setting a precedent soon for the future of games.
4707100	4719000	That I do. There is a case that was, the US Supreme Court is going to be reviewing Schwarzenegger
4719000	4725300	versus the Entertainment Merchants Association about a law that they're trying to get passed
4725300	4735300	here that would put fines on renting or selling violent games to kids. Because, and the way
4735300	4743000	they're trying to get around the First Amendment rule is that they're easier to get their hands
4743000	4749400	on and would cause more immediate harm than seeing it through TV movies or the internet.
4749400	4757900	How is buying a video game easier than TV? TV, you turn a box on and it, that astounds
4757900	4764500	me. That's a bold argument. It's dumb. I don't understand why they're making this argument.
4764500	4768100	They're wasting time on issues that really don't need to be even focused on.
4768100	4776100	The rest of the issue, too, is that while there are rules protecting minors from sexual
4776100	4783100	imagery, there's not too many about violence. The way that I see that is, again, it's scapegoapism.
4783100	4787100	You know, easy target, let's put everything on the video games and absolve the parents
4787100	4788100	of their responsibility.
4788100	4791100	Exactly. That's all it is. Because, you know, if the parents aren't going to be responsible,
4791100	4795000	the government's got to be responsible for the kids, right? Because that's the stance
4795000	4799300	that they want to take. I think it's absolutely stupid that they're going to have laws. They're
4799300	4804300	even going to, really, I think it might be a way to generate some revenue, you know,
4804300	4809300	for, you know, the states or whatever, just so they can find these people and make some
4809300	4816500	extra money. Maybe that's why they're driven to do this. But I don't see, I think it's
4816500	4819500	really up to the parent to decide what's appropriate for their children.
4819500	4820500	Agreed.
4820500	4823400	You know, you want to play violent video games and that's fine. Like, you know, Halo and
4823400	4828700	M-rated game, I don't think that's really that bad. I think, you know, an adolescent,
4828700	4834400	you know, kid can handle that kind of stuff because it's really sci-fi. Now, Manhunt or
4834400	4838800	something like that, that's a little different. But it's all what you decide is appropriate
4838800	4839800	for your child.
4839800	4844900	I know I've brought this up before, but have you seen that episode in Season 7 of Bullshit
4844900	4848900	where they talked about video games and they had You Know Who on it?
4848900	4849900	No.
4849900	4854000	Well, they did this one and they got permission for everything. There's a kid who's really
4854000	4860000	good at first person shooters, like seven or eight years old. And so they get a marine
4860000	4865000	or an ex-marine or someone who's really, you know, who's a big gamer and also really good
4865000	4870200	with guns, runs a shooting range. And they take the kid out to go shoot an actual gun,
4870200	4876800	a real gun. His mom's there. They've got cops there. Everything's cool. Kids shot the gun
4876800	4887100	once and didn't want to touch it again. And it had him reduced to tears. So clearly there
4887100	4892700	is a difference. You know, if you play a game, you know, a violent game on the TV or even
4892700	4898300	a little gun game on the TV versus shooting an actual firearm.
4898300	4902400	I've gone into a similar thing on this show. You know, I enjoy the occasional, you know,
4902400	4907200	earthquake, unreal tournament and shooting game, but I don't like guns at all. I don't
4907200	4912300	ever want one in my house. I'm against them for me. I realize there's a second amendment.
4912300	4915500	If other people want to have them, that's their right. But for me, I hate guns, like
4915500	4919860	real ones. And, but I like gun games.
4919860	4926820	But see, it's totally, it doesn't teach you how to kill people. If anything, it teaches
4926820	4930980	you maybe, you know, tactics and stuff like that. But it does, in the end, it doesn't
4930980	4934860	teach you how to actually fire the weapon or use the weapon or anything like that.
4934860	4939060	And the human mind is going to be far more creative than an AI in a game would be.
4939060	4943700	Let me get to our chatroom chat.ornisadger.com. Frisbee wants to know California residents,
4943700	4947900	when does Arnold leave the governor seat? January, I believe. And ironically enough,
4947900	4953020	just a couple of days after this is heard is the election. And it's, it's past the primaries
4953020	4960140	and it's down to the Meg Whitman's, the former CEO of eBay. She's the Republican. And then
4960140	4964300	you have Jerry Brown, who was the governor of California in the late seventies, early
4964300	4969220	eighties. Um, but because term limits didn't go in until after he was in office, he's able
4969220	4973900	to run again. So it's a very interesting matchup. Very interesting.
4973900	4978260	In neither one. I like that's the way a lot of people in the state feel. And it's, I hate
4978260	4982500	her a lot just because of her campaign right now, because it's just smear, smear, smear,
4982500	4988540	smear, smear. And for a lot of people I talk to it's, who do you dislike less? I've made
4988540	4993300	up my mind, but I'm, I'm also a one issue kind of person and both candidates have made
4993300	4999420	it pretty clear where they stand on the issue. So I'm, I, uh, I know where I'm voting. Um,
4999420	5004020	my absentee ballot should be coming before too long. Are you voting for Bill the cat?
5004020	5011520	No, but keep him, keep in mind that I, I vote absentee every time I vote so that I can make
5011520	5018300	photocopy of my vote and then mail in my original so that it can't be tampered with. But that's
5018300	5025780	funny. Um, well the other thing I was going to say too, um, in response to the whole violent
5025780	5029700	video game things, and we've also brought this up too, is that the rate of violence
5029700	5037220	has gone down in minors since, or at least gun related violence I think, or armed violence
5037220	5044960	has gone down since 1991, you know, when the Nintendo popped up. Um, another thing too,
5044960	5053860	and this just has to go to, uh, guns in general, is I think that a lack of exposure opens up
5053860	5061500	the door, I think, for putting people in danger. Um, because it's actually a proven statistic
5061500	5066540	that in those gun free zones, you know what I'm talking about, that the rate of, uh, of
5066540	5073980	gun related violence is higher because anyone... People always want what they can't have. Well,
5073980	5078980	it's not just that. If it's a gun free zone, then people who normally carry a firearm on
5078980	5086460	themselves, a legal firearm, and follow the law, who won't be armed. They won't be armed.
5086460	5090260	It makes people a target. It's, it's, if you, you know in a place you're going to go somewhere
5090260	5093740	where you've got a likely chance that they're going to be following the rules there, you've
5093740	5100200	got an easy target. It's just, it's those states where, uh, people are allowed to carry
5100200	5104860	firearms on them, that they have the lowest amount, because an armed society is a polite
5104860	5113620	society. But, going back, these are related, trust me. But, um, if you can establish this
5113620	5118860	difference, make them something that someone's exposed to and say, hey, this is a dangerous
5118860	5123700	object, you shouldn't be using this. This is not the same thing as this. When you give
5123700	5131100	them item A and item B to compare, then I think that that level of exposure is going
5131100	5136080	to put it in pretty early. Oh, well, this is not reality. I don't have to be afraid
5136080	5141760	of this. You know what I mean? And I know a lot of people can distinguish between what's
5141760	5147980	real and what's not real, even kids, and I think a lot of times they just, that's what
5147980	5151020	they blame. You know, if they're not blaming video games for violence, they're blaming
5151020	5157100	guns for violence. And it's just, the problem is, no one's ever calling these people out
5157100	5161900	and saying, you know, no, like, especially these court cases that go, oh, the video game
5161900	5166220	made me do it, and the judge just doesn't go, take some goddamn responsibility for yourself.
5166220	5170780	There's a few that have been thrown out, actually, lately, because, um, they, uh, talked it up
5170780	5175140	to parental negligence. It'll be interesting to see how the Supreme Court goes on this
5175140	5180240	one, though, because it definitely will set a precedent, if nothing else. Well, and, though,
5180240	5186740	they're going to have to go by previous precedents, uh, precedent set, like, um, what was that
5186740	5192420	public decency, um, thing that ended up being a free speech? You know, there was, in Florida,
5192420	5198340	there was, um, there's a boob march every year, and it's allowed to go through as freedom
5198340	5204860	of expression. If we can have boobs flapping around in humidity, I think that we can have
5204860	5211220	a little, I think we can, I think we can have a little headshot, don't you think? I support
5211220	5216940	this, and I think that this should expand across the country. I support, like, why are
5216940	5220740	we talking about games? Let's talk more about the boob march. It was, it was something having
5220740	5226480	to do with people who, you know, were, had issues with, you know, men being able to walk
5226480	5230300	without a shirt on and breastfeeding in public and that type of thing. And I agree, it is
5230300	5234700	a shame that women do not get to walk. But then again, you know, this is all post-men
5234700	5241140	of pause boobs, right? No, lots of young people. Oh really, okay, alright. And for the record,
5241140	5248060	when I spawn, I will breastfeed in public. Mental note, don't go out in public with Jamie.
5248060	5253780	Hey! I don't wanna see your boobies. That's why they, that's why they make shawls and
5253780	5258900	covers, you know. I'm being difficult. No, no, I wanna see, whatever, I don't even go
5258900	5263820	in there. She's just like, I don't wanna show you anyway. Alright. My boobs are epic. Moving
5263820	5268100	on. We got a lot of show. In the interest of time, we gotta get on release dates. Let's
5268100	5272460	talk about what violent games are coming to a store near you this week. Not really. Start
5272460	5277940	with the US. Not really many violent games this week, and it's not too much of a release
5277940	5282180	week. It is gonna start ramping up though very soon, but there are some decent things.
5282180	5286420	There's a re-release of Battlefield Bad Company 2, the Ultimate Edition, with some download
5286420	5292900	content there for both Battlefield Bad Company 2 and Battlefield 1943 in there as well. Valkyria
5292900	5299220	Chronicles 2 on the PSP. Gunblade New York City and L.A. Machine Guns on the Wii this
5299220	5308380	week. Metroid Other M on the Wii this week, which is awesome. Camp Rock the Final Jam
5308380	5313140	on the DS, tying in with the movie that's coming out. And I hope they really do mean
5313140	5318820	final because I don't care for those Camp Rock games or anything with Disney as far
5318820	5327940	as our two shows go. Guilty Party on the Wii. It wants to be Clue, but it's just not. Prison
5327940	5331820	Tycoon Alcatraz. I think a lot of this stuff was delayed from last week because I remember
5331820	5336780	reading a bunch of this. The Mumbo Jumbo Six Pack 2nd Edition with a bunch of different
5336780	5345380	Mumbo Jumbo puzzle and card games in there as well. And what probably is gonna be a really
5345380	5353420	shitty game. We wish you a Merry Christmas for the Wii. It's fucking August. I think
5353420	5359220	that's a re-release because honestly, yeah, that is a re-release and it's $10 now. And
5359220	5365420	trust me, it's not worth $10. That is it. Next week will be some good stuff though.
5365420	5369540	Let's go over to Japan and check out what's coming out over there. A lot of price reductions
5369540	5374860	this week on the Xbox. Left 4 Dead 2, Halo 3 ODST, Modern Warfare 2 and Bayonetta all
5374860	5379300	going into the Platinum Collection over there in Japan. And those are really the only releases
5379300	5382340	to look forward to this week. It's kind of a similar situation where we're just kind
5382340	5387220	of waiting for the big rush at the end of the year, which will start any day now. Moving
5387220	5391460	on to the PlayStation 3, same thing. Lots of price reductions, but that includes NBA
5391460	5396500	Live 10, Need for Speed Shift, FIFA Soccer 10, World Class Soccer, Call of Duty Modern
5396500	5401900	Warfare 2 and Bayonetta. That's on the PlayStation 3. Again, these are Japanese releases or price
5401900	5407340	reductions as the case may be as things move into the Platinum Series over there. Looking
5407340	5412620	at the Nintendo Wii, big releases over there this week. Just Metroid Other M gets its release
5412620	5416080	on September 2nd, so it's coming out over there this week as well. They didn't really
5416080	5419740	get it earlier or later. Just a couple days later I guess if we want to be technical.
5419740	5424940	PlayStation 2 doesn't have a whole lot going on. There is a new FIFA Soccer 10 coming out
5424940	5430180	there and Shin Sangoku Musou 5 Special gets a price reduction if you're into that.
5430180	5435940	I have to add something real quick here. I just noticed this on the Kotaku release list,
5435940	5443500	which I believe is from GameSpot. I'm assuming this is a download title. Well, actually I'm
5443500	5447700	pretty positive this is a download title, but it's awesome. Cthulhu Saves the World
5447700	5452820	on Xbox 360. There are so many things wrong with that because Cthulhu never really saves
5452820	5460340	anything unless it's saving by cleansing all humanity off of the world. But maybe that's
5460340	5465380	coming out on 360 this week. Maybe an Xbox Live Arcade game? I don't know. Who knows?
5465380	5466380	That's an awesome name.
5466380	5473860	Alright, also in Japan this week on the Nintendo DS, a game called Nintama Rantaru Gakunin
5473860	5479580	Taikosuan Puzzle No Dawn comes out this week. Basically it's a puzzle game with chibi little
5479580	5485220	characters. It looks like a lot of twin type characters or characters in teams. So it almost
5485220	5489740	looks like an amazing race puzzle game with chibi characters? Maybe not.
5489740	5493900	Then lastly, going on to the Sony PSP and seeing if anything is coming out over there
5493900	5499460	worth mentioning. Bleach Heat the Soul 7 because you know you've missed your Bleach games.
5499460	5503220	There's another one coming out on PSP this week. Also a game called White Breath Perfect
5503220	5511140	Edition comes out this week as well on the PSP. It's called White Breath. It is an adventure
5511140	5514940	game. Trying to figure out if it's a dating sim or what. It's another one of those kind
5514940	5520620	of like read and respond to the characters as they're talking to you. There's so many
5520620	5523860	Japanese games that look like this. But you can choose. It looks like there's a music
5523860	5527620	mode. There's a music song called Slapstick. Yeah, whatever. There you go. Those are your
5527620	5530660	releases in Japan this week. How about Europe?
5530660	5537980	We do have some goodies in Europe. On the 31st Bioshock 2 Minerva's Den on PS3, PC,
5537980	5547060	Xbox 360. Dead Rising 2 Case 0 on Xbox 360. On September 3rd we have Metroid Other M and
5547060	5554100	Tom Clancy's Hawk 2 and Valkyria Chronicles. So that's going to be a week of excitement.
5554100	5562020	Alright, just a few more news stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week.
5562020	5567780	Alright. Let's see, there's some other cool stuff here. It's interesting, this week there
5567780	5574300	was a lot of talk about used game stuff. Despite the fact, you know, THQ thinks you're all
5574300	5580780	cheaters for buying used games. But apparently some of their direct customers are going to
5580780	5587620	be cheaters as well. Target is actually buying used games. They started their used game buying
5587620	5593780	program. It's actually kind of taking place right now in Northern California. But they're
5593780	5600660	going to be rolling out 850 stores by the year's end. I'm not really sure how that program
5600660	5607620	works but that'll be interesting. I guess you can trade in games for store credit there.
5607620	5615780	I wonder what the trade in rate will be like. And then of course, to go with that, Best
5615780	5621300	Buy. They've been rumored to be mulling over a trade in program. In fact they had those
5621300	5628340	kiosks at one point. Well now they've actually begun doing used game trade ins as well. And
5628340	5637900	they also have, I guess, $20 gift cards for select titles. If you trade in a certain game
5637900	5648420	they'll give you $20, I guess, addition. Oh, I guess they'll give you $20 instead of the
5648420	5657340	titles trade in volume. But hey, $20 for games sometimes is pretty good. So yeah, it's interesting.
5657340	5661740	So I'm sure if these guys start doing this that probably other retailers, especially
5661740	5667500	if they're successful with it, won't be too far behind. And then everybody will be cheaters.
5667500	5679900	What will you think then, THQ? I think they'll probably poop themselves. Anybody planning
5679900	5685100	to take advantage of these programs? No, not really. I like the idea that I can take old
5685100	5691180	video games and turn them in at Target and turn them around and buy new shoes or a loaf
5691180	5697220	of bread. Yeah, nice. Alright, one more story for this half of the show and it's about the
5697220	5703460	Silver Lining. Remember that was the King's Quest fan game that had some problems legally
5703460	5707700	and then finally they were able to release it. Hooray and it was free. Double hooray.
5707700	5712140	Well it's in chapters and the next chapter is out in September. That's when it's coming
5712140	5716580	out and that's from the Phoenix Games who made the site. I love that name for that game
5716580	5720420	company because they've been through so much crap. And it's over in a post on their site.
5720420	5724940	It is coming out in September. Hey, that's really soon. No word on when in September
5724940	5729980	but there you go. The name of the game, it's called Episode 2, Two Households. They're
5729980	5734500	saying it will have better pathfinding, the option to switch between extended and short
5734500	5740340	narration, a new walking animation, more subtitle options, and widescreen support. So I guess
5740340	5743340	it sounds like they've taken a lot of feedback from the first game and implemented it. So
5743340	5750500	that's really cool. In a related story, the website GOG.com, G-O-G.com or goodollegames.com,
5750500	5755300	they're having a King's Quest 1 through 3 bundle selling right now for $9.99. There's
5755300	5760300	also a pack with 4, 5, and 6 with the same price. You ever looked at GOG.com? They actually
5760300	5766380	have quite a few old, old games for sale on there. And a good way to get legitimate what
5766380	5771460	they, I've seen called Abandonware before when people just put up old games because
5771460	5776180	they say it's old, no one cares about it anymore. As long as it's not Game.com. No, it's not
5776180	5780220	that. I had one of those and the Taco and got rid of them both. You had an N-Gage really?
5780220	5785580	Yes, I did. Oh my god. I brought it, Rob, I brought it with me to E3 one year. Clearly
5785580	5790120	I've erased it from my memory and can you blame me? And I'm glad that you know exactly
5790120	5795820	what I was talking about when I said Taco. Well, what other gaming devices look like
5795820	5803060	a taco? Alright, speaking of stuff in gaming's history, let's take a walk down gaming history
5803060	5808400	lane and review the classic game of the week. Every week Dark Sakura likes to step into
5808400	5812820	the vault, or her living room as the case may be, and pull out a classic game that she
5812820	5819540	says, hey, you little brats, you should be playing this game. So Dark Sakura, what is
5819540	5823700	the classic game of the week this week? The classic game is Zillion for the Sega Master
5823700	5834100	System. Yay! Now you gotta do something, Rob. What? Let's play this for a second. This is
5834100	5838980	the theme music from the game. Okay. Now play the theme music from the anime. Play the theme
5838980	5849020	music from the anime. I can do that. Okay. I'm prepared here for a change. That's actually
5849020	5856380	one of the best qualities I have that I can play. Now, does the gun look familiar? Yes,
5856380	5859660	the gun does look familiar, wow. You can link that in the chat room. Sure, I'll link this
5859660	5866900	in the chat room. Okay. The game and the anime Zillion came out as companions to each other.
5866900	5871620	I'm gonna switch and do some play of the game, sorry, didn't mean to cut you off. That's
5871620	5880820	pretty cool. The game actually in Japan, its full name is Akai Kodan Zillion, which is
5880820	5888580	Red Photon Zillion. And it kind of is Metroid-ish. It came out though before then, I believe.
5888580	5894540	It was out in 1987 for the Sega Master System. And there was a sequel called Zillion II,
5894540	5903660	the Triformation. It also had things in common with Impossible Mission too. Basically, the
5903660	5908940	general story, you play a group called the White Knights and you have to go get rid of
5908940	5915180	this base on Planet X. So you play the main dude, JJ, and you rescue Apple and Champ,
5915180	5919660	who are the other guys. Keep in mind, early anime. Just real quick, don't want to cut
5919660	5925620	you off, but since you brought it up, August 6th, 1986 was Metroid. Okay, so then it was
5925620	5934020	afterwards. Alright. Anyway, you have to go past tripwires, turrets, force fields, a bunch
5934020	5939620	of enemy guards. Including in some places, they kind of run in, like Metal Gear style.
5939620	5947140	The little alert noise, so it's pretty cool. You carry a little gun with you and if those
5947140	5952660	and chat room are checking it out, the gun is the same design, it's the design for the
5952660	5958900	Sega Master System light phaser. Um, and of course you gain levels for your guns and then
5958900	5963860	you can rescue, like I said, Apple and Champ and they have, Apple is fast but weak, Champ
5963860	5969160	is slow and strong and JJ is like a nice balance in between them. There's also a glitch in
5969160	5976160	the game that you can become invincible by dying when you go into a room to room elevator.
5976160	5981680	Um, but you can't go to your status menu. Um, the only way you can switch characters is
5981680	5986360	when you find a new teammate. Um, and of course, you know, remember this is the Master System,
5986360	5991880	it is kind of inconvenient to go pause your game on the system like it was back in the
5991880	5998880	day. Um, but the, uh, the music, uh, is, uh, of course a lot the same music from the, uh,
5998880	6004880	the anime. Um, and the one where you go in and out of their main ship, it plays the opening
6004880	6011280	theme from the anime. And it plays it when the Sega label goes off. And then, um, it's,
6011280	6016080	it's pretty cool. It's got an actual soundtrack called Akai Kodan Zillion Let It Rock, which
6016080	6023080	I have, just saying. And the anime's pretty good too, actually. Um, but the game is, uh,
6023080	6029080	it's got a lot of, uh, you know, different special messages in it. And you have, the
6029080	6032080	way that you go through those rooms is that you have these little pods that you have to
6032080	6035480	blow up and get a character out of. And then you put them into a computer. And the characters
6035480	6040280	don't have to be in any particular order, by the way. Um, and then you get, like, some
6040280	6045080	special codes that will summon, you know, like, will turn off the tripwires or something.
6045080	6050080	And they do other stuff. This more reminds me of Impossible Mission. That's what I love
6050080	6054080	said earlier. I said that it has a lot in common with Impossible Mission. Yeah, yeah.
6054080	6060080	But... Just having looked at this for a little bit now, yeah. But keep in mind, this is,
6060080	6066080	this is a pretty, pretty sweet game. And it doesn't have a save function, sadly. Dan left
6066080	6073080	his game paused while he was playing it for hours on end so he could do other stuff. But
6073080	6077080	I'd have to say, it's among the list of, you know, one of my favorite things about this
6077080	6086080	game. And also keep in mind, there's a little guest star in Zillion. There's the Oppa Oppa.
6086080	6094080	Really? When you're, cause you can shoot different of those little, you know, pods and get power-ups
6094080	6100080	and one of your power-ups is an Oppa Oppa and it gives you a level up. And it's just
6100080	6107080	a little icon of an Oppa Oppa. Well, I think this is alternate audio. I don't think that's
6107080	6110080	actually the game. Yeah, that one, if this one I'm thinking of that is. They said they
6110080	6119080	unsynced and had to use different music. Dope. But yeah, um, if you watch the anime too,
6119080	6124080	there's little scenes where the Oppa Oppa is hanging out with them. Some little references.
6124080	6129080	Fantasy Zone. Awesome. And of course we know what Fantasy Zone also had to do with,
6129080	6135080	Space Harrier. Maybe we should have Seven Degrees of Space Harrier. Could be a new game
6135080	6139080	to play. Yeah. Alright, well there it is, your classic game of the week, Zillion for
6139080	6145080	the Sega Master System. Go play it. It's fun. Alright. We'll see what she picks next week
6145080	6149080	cause you still get one for the marathon show. So, and now, then we might have to actually
6149080	6153080	play it. I think we should. We'll see. I'm gonna dig into the closet and go obscure.
6153080	6159080	Better not suck. That's all I'm saying. Alright. We're gonna take a quick break here at Orange
6159080	6162080	Lounge Radio. Just for that I'm gonna make Rob play through Bongio by himself on One
6162080	6166080	Man. Why? Why would you do that? Alright. Alright. We're gonna take a quick break here
6166080	6170080	at Orange Lounge Radio but don't go anywhere. We will be right back with plenty more news
6170080	6174080	stories. We got your Twitter topics coming too so make sure you get those in on Twitter.
6174080	6185080	Your emails and phone calls all when we get back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
6185080	6190080	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio. We are taping live on this Sunday evening,
6190080	6197080	August the 29th of 2010. It is the 379th episode of our show and lots of folks in our chat
6197080	6201080	room talking about the upcoming marathon last week. Some folks asking, Robert M. is asking
6201080	6205080	in chat, any chance of the marathon being on the podcast or would there be licensed
6205080	6210080	music being used? Right now I don't see why it wouldn't be podcast. I mean I guess it
6210080	6215080	depends on what happens and the legality of what happens. But I don't see why not. It
6215080	6219080	will probably be labeled separately so that those folks, you know, because not everybody
6219080	6223080	is gonna want to hear. Because it's gonna have a different flow. It's not gonna be as,
6223080	6230080	dare I say it, polished as this show is. Which you know is gonna be really bad. But you know
6230080	6234080	I'm gonna label it differently. But it will be there for folks to download. But those
6234080	6238080	folks that aren't really interested in the excess will be able to just get the regular
6238080	6243080	3 hour show and move on with it. But yeah that's what we're aiming for right now anyway.
6243080	6248080	We'll let you know for sure of course after we tape next week. Anyhow we've got more
6248080	6252080	news to get into. And of course we're gonna get your Twitter topics here in just a minute.
6252080	6256080	And the FUs of the week, the mailbag, all those fun segments. Phone calls coming up
6256080	6261080	too. But first, quick quick quick news. And things, there's just so much to talk about
6261080	6265080	this week. We just don't have time to spend 10 minutes on everything. But Loki what do
6265080	6269080	we want to talk about quickly? This is Vegas. It's apparently cancelled. It was a game
6269080	6274080	that was being developed by Surreal Software for Midway. But of course when Midway
6274080	6279080	closed down it was then bought up by Warner Brothers Interactive. The premise of the game
6279080	6284080	was retarded as it was. It's basically you going to Vegas, dancing, driving fast cars,
6284080	6291080	punching people, and gambling. And apparently the game is rumored to have cost 43 million
6291080	6299080	dollars to make. Wow what a waste of money that was. But no confirmation whether it's
6299080	6305080	coming, it's actually cancelled or not but who gives a crap. What are you talking about?
6305080	6310080	That's what I do every time I go visit Tara. Exactly. Gamble and punch people. Why would
6310080	6316080	you want to play a game that do that? I just don't understand. The homebrew channel, it's
6316080	6323080	been something that's been kind of a staple of the homebrew community on the Wii for
6323080	6332080	quite a while now. Since the release of homebrew channel version 1.07 they have added
6332080	6341080	anonymous user statistics to the homebrew channel installations as well. And apparently
6341080	6349080	they have detected about 200,000 people using the homebrew channel on the Wii. So that's
6349080	6355080	kind of cool. And unsurprisingly I guess the top country using this would be the USA
6355080	6366080	followed by France, Germany, Spain, and the Great Britain. And it's interesting though
6366080	6372080	that with that many systems out there there's not really a lot of people that use kind of
6372080	6379080	the homebrew channel for stuff. So maybe the hacking and piracy stuff on the Wii isn't
6379080	6385080	as prevalent as they think it is. Of course there's other methods for that but it's
6385080	6393080	interesting nonetheless. And finally a unique MMO has been announced called Dead State.
6393080	6401080	It is possibly the first zombie RPG that's available as an MMO. It's coming from a
6401080	6409080	company called Double Bear, which is better than a single bear. And I guess that developer
6409080	6419080	is composed of Bethesda and Troika Vets. They've come up with this new RPG set in a
6419080	6427080	fictional town called Splendid, Texas. Which is in the grips of a full on zombie
6427080	6434080	apocalypse. And the object is to keep yourself alive. And I guess you operate out of a
6434080	6440080	local school which serves as a hub and sanctuary from the horrors of the community.
6440080	6446080	And from there you must head out into the wild hunting down supplies and other survivors.
6446080	6454080	And of course using those resources to beef up your base there. And of course there's
6454080	6460080	tons of zombies and not everybody that you find will be friendly or sane for that matter.
6460080	6465080	And combat is supposed to be turn based and you'll be able to issue commands to whole
6465080	6473080	groups or individuals as well. So that's supposed to be headed out on a PC sometime
6473080	6476080	I guess relatively soon.
6476080	6479080	Taking a step backward here real quick in chat, but it's a good chat comment. Tiger
6479080	6483080	Claw in our chat says, and those who pirate games, some people have been playing Metroid
6483080	6488080	Other M on Justin TV. And I noticed one playing a pirated version that was loaded from
6488080	6490080	the homebrew channel.
6490080	6495080	I'm sure there are. It's been leaked out since last week so I wouldn't be surprised.
6495080	6500080	Yikes. Alright well moving on to some other quick news here. I'm talking about another
6500080	6505080	game coming out from Sony. It's up on PlayStation Japan. There's apparently a teaser
6505080	6511080	page. And on this page you see this Japanese guy sitting in a tuxedo and it looks like
6511080	6513080	he's knitting.
6513080	6515080	It looks like the Godfather.
6515080	6520080	It is what it looks like but it's on PlayStation Japan and EA owns the rights to the Godfather
6520080	6522080	but the Godfather is knitting.
6522080	6525080	It's for LittleBigPlanet 2.
6525080	6526080	You think?
6526080	6528080	No it's been confirmed that's what it's for.
6528080	6529080	Interesting.
6529080	6534080	Because he's crocheting a sack boy. But it's just funny because if you actually go to the
6534080	6537080	page there's an animation of him crocheting.
6537080	6538080	Cute.
6538080	6543080	Alright I get it. That's funny. Alright. Also some updates on I made a game with
6543080	6547080	Jambi Jinich. See when people speak and leads speak that's how I say it. I made a game
6547080	6549080	with Jambi Jinich.
6549080	6553080	Because they use three for E and one for I and all that stuff.
6553080	6555080	So yeah.
6555080	6560080	Apparently I made a game with Jambi Jinich. It has sold over 300,000 copies.
6560080	6562080	That's a lot for an indie game.
6562080	6564080	A lot a lot of games.
6564080	6570080	Also the theme song to Jambi's is now available on Rock Band Network.
6570080	6576080	Also if that wasn't enough you're soon going to be able to get Jambi's shirts and Hot Topic.
6576080	6579080	Because you know Hot Topic loves to get in on that trendy stuff.
6579080	6585080	And I love this shirt here. It just says Jambi's with a big exclamation exclamation one.
6585080	6587080	There you go.
6587080	6596080	Also real quickly some music game news updates. BeatMania 2DX 18 called Resort Anthem.
6596080	6598080	I know right. I'm like wow they got four.
6598080	6599080	Resort Anthem. It doesn't matter what it's called.
6599080	6603080	2DX Sports Resort. It will always be 18th style to me.
6603080	6606080	But Resort Anthem has a release date at September 15th.
6606080	6610080	There you go. And all those no arcades that will import that here in the US.
6610080	6616080	And then lastly DDRX2 is going to be location tested very soon in Joy-Z.
6616080	6620080	I don't have the specifics on where. I'm hoping someone here in chat room can fill me in.
6620080	6624080	Unfortunately my little newsy link is... Oh there we go. On the border with lots of skee-ball.
6624080	6630080	It wasn't working a minute ago. No it actually is going to be at Funplex in East Hanover, New Jersey.
6630080	6636080	That's where it's at. Enjoy if you live in Joy-Z or nearby.
6636080	6639080	Go play some X2 and let us know what you think. Dark Sakura.
6639080	6642080	I got your news right here.
6642080	6649080	Well there's a rumor going that for Marvel vs. Capcom 3 that Crimson Viper is going to be a character in it.
6649080	6657080	But I think it's looking at this outline in the way that they have it done on the site.
6657080	6665080	That I think it's actually very likely Crimson Viper. They just masked her out and showed the silhouette and it fits perfectly.
6665080	6672080	She's cheap. Why put her in the game?
6672080	6677080	Why do people hate her so much? I was reading the comments on that site and there's a lot of hate for Crimson Viper.
6677080	6678080	She's a cheap whore.
6678080	6682080	Well a lot of characters in Street Fighter are cheap whores. That's what the game's all about.
6682080	6683080	She's a masher's paradise.
6683080	6685080	Sounds good to me.
6685080	6686080	She's Eddie Gordo.
6686080	6689080	I used to love Eddie Gordo in Tekken 3.
6689080	6690080	Masher.
6690080	6691080	And what? And what?
6691080	6698080	So what are you going to do when you have Tekken vs. Street Fighter or whatever and you can do Eddie Gordo vs. Crimson Viper?
6698080	6701080	What he said.
6701080	6707080	It's like, mash mash mash mash, switch, mash mash mash, switch.
6707080	6712080	All the buttons on my controller break within a week. How did this happen?
6712080	6716080	What did you do that for? Well how about something for a different game?
6716080	6721080	I don't know when I started talking in Leetspeak. How did this happen?
6721080	6728080	Crackdown 2, Rob. Crackdown 2. A.K.A. I like jumping the sequel.
6728080	6736080	Basically the new download content is going to be, it's called Toy Box.
6736080	6748080	And it's a free, there's a free version that will have one called Keys to the City, which is an unlock, and the thruster ability, which is jet packs for your boot and vehicle tag.
6748080	6758080	And then if you pay the 560 Microsoft points, then you'll get 5 new weapons, 2 new vehicles, a couple of avatar items, 10 new cheevos.
6758080	6761080	So, according to this, I guess that means achievement, huh?
6761080	6762080	Mhm.
6762080	6768080	I think that's a stupid word. It makes me think of cheetos, and now I want some.
6768080	6773080	Why have cheetos when you can have those, like, knockoff cheetos that are like the cheesy poops?
6773080	6775080	Like there's much more. Cheese puffs.
6775080	6782080	Cheese puffs or whatever. They sell them in big ol' bags at Trader Joe's. They're just, they're still cheesy, but they're more puffy.
6782080	6784080	And they make me more puffy when I eat them.
6784080	6785080	How about something else?
6785080	6787080	How about it?
6787080	6802080	Oh, wait, wait. I want to say real quick. If Microsoft knew what they were doing, they would release download content for, I don't know, 400 points, 800 points, that would allow you to go into the arena with the announcer and flamethrower him to death.
6802080	6806080	And then they'll talk and announce about how he's dying. And why would you want to kill me?
6806080	6812080	I've got a wife and family, peacekeeper, or whatever, agent.
6812080	6815080	You can bite my butt, boss.
6815080	6816080	You know.
6816080	6817080	Anyway.
6817080	6827080	It's Robert Stack, okay? They somehow have downloaded his consciousness into the game, and that's who I picture talking to me, and it makes me all warm and fuzzy inside.
6827080	6830080	Yeah, but you said Robert Stack, and I think Ultra Magnus.
6830080	6836080	Because Transformers the movie was awesome. Not the new ones! The old school, animated.
6836080	6840080	Anyway, um, but we need sad music, Rob. We need really sad music.
6840080	6843080	Um, okay, hold on. Let me get you some sad music.
6843080	6845080	Or maybe like some Sanctus or something.
6845080	6847080	Can you fill time while I get you sad music?
6847080	6850080	Well, I know this is supposed to be like a little quick segment.
6850080	6851080	I made a game with...
6851080	6856080	Hold on, hold on, here's your sad music.
6856080	6858080	Come on, work.
6861080	6862080	Oh wait.
6862080	6865080	Sorry, I got the B-52's funplex.
6865080	6868080	I was thinking funplex earlier, I know.
6868080	6871080	I got the song for the other story mixed up. Oh well, make it work.
6871080	6875080	You can just play this.
6875080	6881080	We have to say rest in peace to a company who has brought us a bunch of games.
6881080	6886080	They brought us Space Jam.
6886080	6891080	They brought us Burnout.
6891080	6897080	Bye, Acclaim! Acclaim is going down.
6897080	6899080	I thought they'd been down for a while.
6899080	6901080	I'm going down now.
6904080	6906080	It's just fun.
6911080	6915080	Rob, you are a sick puppy.
6915080	6918080	Sick puppy!
6918080	6920080	Sorry, Acclaim.
6920080	6927080	Well, yeah, basically the deal is that Howard Marks bought the name
6927080	6931080	and tried to reboot it as a free-to-play games portal.
6931080	6932080	It was terrible.
6932080	6934080	Yeah, in Crash and Burn.
6934080	6937080	I think you can go to the site and get refunds.
6937080	6939080	Anyway.
6939080	6942080	What was the last big thing Acclaim did?
6942080	6944080	I haven't seen that name since...
6944080	6945080	Gosh.
6945080	6947080	Welcome to NBA Jam.
6947080	6948080	Didn't they do Double Dragon?
6948080	6949080	Okay, NBA Jam.
6949080	6952080	I was going to say Double Dragon 2 on the NES, I think it was then.
6952080	6953080	Yeah.
6953080	6957080	But even NBA Jam, though, the last system it was out was...
6957080	6959080	I think it was...
6959080	6963080	Other than the download versions, they did one on the PlayStation.
6963080	6965080	Well, they did. You're right.
6965080	6969080	Yeah, that we've been looking for that isn't the other version.
6969080	6972080	Thank you, Rama. Acclaim did BMX XXX.
6972080	6973080	That was Acclaim.
6973080	6976080	I think that was the first foot in the grave.
6976080	6978080	What a fine piece of gaming history that game is.
6978080	6979080	I thought that was mid...
6979080	6981080	Yeah, I guess it was Acclaim.
6981080	6983080	It was a fun game, okay?
6983080	6985080	It was fun.
6985080	6986080	Alright, let's move on, guys.
6986080	6989080	It was kind of cool dragging a hoe around on your bike.
6989080	6992080	As in a BMX bike.
6992080	6998080	Wow, let's get into some Twitter topics!
6998080	7003080	Every week you guys send us your tweets at twitter.com slash O-L-R.
7003080	7005080	Let's read some of them tweets.
7005080	7007080	Lots of tweets from DJ Blazkin.
7007080	7011080	I can't read all of these because some of these are coming up later in the show.
7011080	7013080	Besides, we have a two tweet limit.
7013080	7015080	You're getting greedy with the tweets.
7015080	7017080	DJ Blazkin is announcing this.
7017080	7021080	I read this earlier in the week and I think this is worth reading.
7021080	7024080	G4 has announced, according to DJ Blazkin here in this news story,
7024080	7028080	a new show called Bomb Patrol Afghanistan.
7028080	7029080	Have you heard about this?
7029080	7034080	This is the show on G4, which I don't know why we're reporting on this on the show.
7034080	7037080	I think we banned G4 news from the show a while ago, but oh well, moment of weakness.
7037080	7040080	They've made a show out of The Hurt Locker.
7040080	7042080	Yeah, the one that won the Oscar.
7042080	7045080	Yeah, apparently it is Bomb Patrol Afghanistan.
7045080	7049080	It's a new series about real life soldiers who put their lives on the line every day
7049080	7052080	as members of the Explosive Ordnance Disposal.
7052080	7057080	The show will follow the lives of the EOD team both at home and in Afghanistan.
7057080	7061080	You know what? All things considered, I don't think it sounds like a bad show.
7061080	7063080	It's just basically a documentary-ish type of show.
7063080	7068080	I mean, it's not like they're voting people out or bombing people when they lose.
7068080	7070080	You get voted out of Afghanistan!
7070080	7071080	Kaboom!
7071080	7072080	Sweet!
7072080	7074080	Yeah, so I don't know.
7074080	7076080	I'm sorry, we're sending you home.
7076080	7077080	You know why this is news?
7077080	7080080	It's an interesting show on G4.
7080080	7082080	But I really don't understand The Hurt Locker connection.
7082080	7085080	I think it's just they're doing it because of the movie.
7085080	7086080	I think I would watch it.
7086080	7092080	It made that subject, it put that subject in the public eye, if you will.
7092080	7094080	And this is just furthering that, so I don't know.
7094080	7096080	I don't necessarily see it as bad news.
7096080	7101080	It's just not gaming, but how long has G4 not been gaming for?
7101080	7104080	I'll tell you, a really long time.
7104080	7108080	By the way, also, in somewhat related-ish news,
7108080	7114080	EA is standing by their, again, this is from a tweet from DJ Blazekin,
7114080	7119080	EA is standing by Medal of Honor's choice to include the Taliban.
7119080	7122080	You'll see a comment here from British Defense Secretary Liam Fox,
7122080	7124080	who criticized the game, quote,
7124080	7127080	At the hands of the Taliban, children have lost fathers and wives have lost husbands.
7127080	7132080	It's shocking that someone would think it is acceptable to recreate the acts of the Taliban and British soldiers.
7132080	7138080	It's hard to believe any citizen of our country would wish to buy such a thoroughly un-British game.
7138080	7143080	I would urge retailers to show their support for our armed forces and ban this tasteless product.
7143080	7150080	Ooh, EA standing by it, saying it is a creative risk, but they are not going to let the protesters, quote,
7150080	7154080	Compromise our creative vision and what we want to do.
7154080	7156080	If you don't like it, don't buy it.
7156080	7158080	Sounds good to me.
7158080	7161080	Going back to the tweets.
7161080	7162080	Let's see.
7162080	7165080	Darkiske says, talk about Reach.
7165080	7168080	I have to admit, I haven't really been paying attention to a lot of the details about Halo Reach.
7168080	7170080	I can't reach you from here, Rob.
7170080	7173080	I didn't play Halo 3 ODST at all.
7173080	7176080	I'm not a Halo hater, I used to love Halo.
7176080	7179080	I played Halo 1, I loved Halo 2.
7179080	7182080	I played a shit ton of Halo 2 and I even played a little bit of Halo 3.
7182080	7186080	But I don't know, Halo 3 just kind of, it wasn't as...
7186080	7191080	Plus the group I used to play with, a bunch of college buddies, a bunch of them had babies and stuff.
7191080	7194080	They don't want to play video games online anymore.
7194080	7196080	So there you go.
7196080	7198080	I kind of lost interest in the Halo series.
7198080	7200080	I'll check it out.
7200080	7202080	If somebody I know buys it, I'll look.
7202080	7204080	Is Dan getting Halo Reach?
7204080	7206080	You guys probably aren't getting it, huh?
7206080	7208080	That depends.
7208080	7210080	Yeah, he'll probably get Halo Reach.
7210080	7212080	I'm sure it's a popular game.
7212080	7214080	We'll see.
7214080	7218080	Tigerclaw305 sends us some links.
7218080	7222080	Real quickly, a Wii balance board used to create a motorized baby buggy.
7222080	7224080	That's awesome.
7224080	7226080	How does that work?
7226080	7230080	It's a toddler that can't really, or not even toddler, an infant that can't walk yet.
7230080	7234080	So they sit her down in this little infant seat.
7234080	7238080	And it's sitting on top of a Wii balance board.
7238080	7242080	And below that is a robot.
7242080	7248080	And so when she leans to go grab for something, because babies like to grab at what they want,
7248080	7250080	it goes in that direction.
7250080	7252080	Who makes the Skynet?
7252080	7254080	It's a college student.
7254080	7256080	Oh, of course.
7256080	7258080	But it's awfully cute.
7258080	7260080	Also another link from Tigerclaw.
7260080	7264080	Lenovo developing a motion control console for China.
7264080	7268080	I guess it's called the E-Box, is what this is.
7268080	7270080	It's the technology of Kinect.
7270080	7276080	Unlike the move in the Wii, E-Box plots movements and translates them into an on-screen action
7276080	7278080	without the need for controller.
7278080	7282080	No price announced yet, but it will be between the price of a Wii and a 360.
7282080	7285080	The console, I think this is an interesting topic here too.
7285080	7290080	The console will also focus less on violence and more on family entertainment.
7290080	7292080	Well, as does the Kinect.
7292080	7294080	Oops.
7294080	7297080	I swear I didn't plan that song to come on, but it's kind of funny in retrospect.
7297080	7299080	Alright, anyhow.
7299080	7302080	More tweets.
7302080	7304080	Maybe this will be the last one here.
7304080	7306080	Oh no, there's a couple here.
7306080	7308080	DarkKiske gets another one in here.
7308080	7312080	Maxis Darkspore, a Diablo-style action RPG.
7312080	7314080	I don't know much about Darkspore.
7314080	7316080	Is this a game you know a little more about?
7316080	7320080	It's basically a spore, but set in a Diablo-type gameplay.
7320080	7323080	So you create your character and it's a hack and slash game.
7323080	7325080	Oh, that sounds kind of cool.
7325080	7327080	Maxis is the folks that made Spore after all.
7327080	7329080	They also made The Sims.
7329080	7331080	They've been around a while, because that's basically Will Wright's studio, isn't it?
7331080	7333080	This could be interesting.
7333080	7335080	They're saying it's a co-op focused action game.
7335080	7339080	Ooh, that's cool, because that sounds kind of like the Lara Croft game that I played this week that I like.
7339080	7341080	So I'll check this out.
7341080	7344080	There's some images posted up on this website that we got linked to.
7344080	7346080	Looks interesting. I'll keep an eye on that.
7346080	7349080	Of course, it depends on how much it costs.
7349080	7352080	In this day and age, you've got to watch what you're buying.
7352080	7354080	ActDeft is linking us to a story.
7354080	7358080	X-Play gave Metroid Other M a 2 out of 5.
7358080	7360080	Says no need to watch the video.
7360080	7367080	That's some intern at the station trying to keep X-Play relevant by causing a little controversy, I'm sure.
7367080	7370080	No, I don't know. Maybe the game is terrible. I don't know.
7370080	7373080	It didn't get terrible reviews. I think it looks pretty good.
7373080	7379080	I think what people didn't like was how sometimes it would switch between the first person and third person view.
7379080	7385080	Just if you happened to move the controller off the screen, it would just all of a sudden switch back, and that kind of sucked.
7385080	7391080	And also the fact that you couldn't basically run around in the first person mode, so people had gripes about that.
7391080	7397080	Probably because they've been playing Metroid Prime for a while, but whatever. It looks kind of cool.
7397080	7400080	I'll just go on record and say fuck X-Play.
7400080	7402080	Lastly, Sturlok.
7402080	7408080	Pokemon Black and White are the fastest selling DS games in history. Well, there's a big surprise.
7408080	7410080	Links us to this article.
7410080	7419080	That does confirm, ever since July 31st, 2010, over a million pre-orders for Pokemon Black and White version were taken.
7419080	7425080	That's 1.08 pre-orders for this game launching September 18th, 2010.
7425080	7431080	And so Nintendo is saying that is going to make Pokemon Black and White the fastest selling DS games ever.
7431080	7434080	See, that's cheating, though, because there's two different games there.
7434080	7438080	But they counted as one. That's fuzzy math.
7438080	7442080	Whatever. I guess everybody lets them get away with it, because it's Pokemans.
7442080	7448080	Tigerclaw wants to point out that Metroid Other M has an 81 on Metacritic.
7448080	7453080	So that two out of five seems to be a little bit out of place.
7453080	7456080	Anyhow, let's move on to some other gaming news.
7456080	7460080	If you want to send us some tweets for next week, twitter.com slash O-L-R.
7460080	7464080	Yeah, I'm sure they have their own justifications for that, but whatever.
7464080	7469080	So, since we mentioned Reach a little bit, Reach, of course, did get pirated.
7469080	7479080	There was apparently people that found a way to download the supposed review only version of Reach that was a games on demand package.
7479080	7486080	And, of course, as not a big surprise, Microsoft saying, oh, we're going to ban everybody that's playing Reach.
7486080	7491080	Well, first off, if you're dumb enough to play online with Reach, then yes, you should be banned anyways.
7491080	7497080	I'm assuming that this is also considering people that aren't necessarily playing online,
7497080	7502080	but say people that have a JTAG console or something and have an account that they use for live,
7502080	7506080	and maybe move their account back and forth on a memory unit or something like that,
7506080	7510080	and it would show in your recently played games or something like that,
7510080	7513080	or if you get achievements before the release date.
7513080	7518080	And then they can check out whether you have a mod console or something like that.
7518080	7528080	So, you know, if you don't want to get banned, just don't play with a profile that you use online until it's launched.
7528080	7533080	And they claim, though, that they can tell the difference between this and with the full version,
7533080	7540080	but, you know, if you're really that scared about it, you can always re-download it when it gets leaked out from the disc.
7540080	7545080	I don't know. But, yeah, so they're threatening to ban people, as they probably would.
7545080	7549080	This doesn't come as a big surprise, though. I mean, they always want to ban people who are playing the game.
7549080	7550080	Of course. They don't want to say,
7550080	7555080	Well, oh, darn, I guess there's nothing we can do about it. Steal away.
7555080	7557080	I mean, they're not going to say that.
7557080	7560080	They're going to be like, we're going to come to your house and set you on fire.
7560080	7563080	I mean, that's the kind of threats that they should be making.
7563080	7565080	We will destroy you.
7565080	7568080	If we could make your Xbox do other ring colors, we would.
7568080	7571080	Your console will get set on fire and burn down your house and kill your cat.
7571080	7574080	That's right.
7574080	7577080	I don't know. Shermy's very well insulated.
7577080	7582080	That would be funny, though. They have a robot, like, robot legs built into it.
7582080	7585080	It just gets up, walks out, and goes back to Microsoft.
7585080	7591080	Now, that's a show I want to see on G4. Cat versus Xbox.
7591080	7592080	We've had that at my house.
7592080	7593080	Have you?
7593080	7594080	You know what it was?
7594080	7595080	What?
7595080	7598080	Jamie taking the vacuum to the Xbox to get the cat hair out of it.
7598080	7599080	Mm-hmm. Nice.
7599080	7600080	Cat wins.
7600080	7603080	Maybe the cat was laying on top of it because it's warm. You know that happens quite a bit.
7603080	7608080	Shermy... It would be too much effort for Shermy to get on top of it. I'll put it that way.
7608080	7612080	My cat loves my Xbox 360, especially in the winter. She'll lay behind it.
7612080	7617080	But she'll lay so close to it that there's no airflow, so I don't really appreciate that too much.
7617080	7622080	But she will lay next to it. That and the computer. She loves, you know, all the hot air being blown out.
7622080	7623080	They're warm.
7623080	7626080	Exactly. Or she'll lay on power supplies, you know, like those big old transformers.
7626080	7627080	Mm-hmm.
7627080	7628080	Because they're super hot.
7628080	7629080	Yeah.
7629080	7632080	She's just, like, laying her head right on them. Like, kitty, you're going to electrocute yourself for something.
7632080	7635080	You know what your cat needs is, like, an electric blanket or some other source of...
7635080	7636080	No, she doesn't.
7636080	7642080	You know what I got for Shermy is this mat that redistributes their own heat and warms the whole thing.
7642080	7644080	And she loves it, and it was, like, ten bucks.
7644080	7648080	She has her little baby bed that she lays in still, even though she's, like, way bigger than it.
7648080	7649080	But, you know...
7649080	7650080	You know what your cat needs?
7650080	7652080	She's spoiled, and she doesn't need anything.
7652080	7653080	Kitten mittens.
7654080	7657080	Does your cat make too much noise?
7657080	7662080	Mittens made out of kittens? Well, we got plenty of kittens to do that, so...
7662080	7666080	All right, speaking of which, does anyone want a kitten? I mean, because I've got, like, tons of them.
7666080	7667080	They're overrunning my backyard.
7667080	7670080	What are you going to do if somebody in New York is like, yes, I want a cat?
7670080	7673080	I will put it in a box and ship it UPS. No, no, just kidding.
7673080	7675080	I will not do that because that's cruel.
7675080	7677080	Then we'll ship it FedEx. No.
7677080	7682080	Obviously, I can't get you a cat unless you actually drive all the way out here.
7682080	7686080	Heart eight in our chat room suggests a cat Snuggie. I like that idea.
7686080	7689080	But, unfortunately, you will have to come and... It's kind of like pick and pull.
7689080	7694080	You will have to pick and pull your own cat out of the backyard, so...
7694080	7696080	I can't provide that service for you.
7696080	7698080	There's only one cat that will actually...
7698080	7702080	There's one of the cats that will actually get, like, very, you know, paralyzed with fear.
7702080	7705080	And that's the only cat that I can actually pick up out there.
7705080	7708080	Because it'll just kind of freeze up, and I just...
7708080	7709080	Scoop. Scoop it right up.
7709080	7712080	Can I completely derail the show with a YouTube?
7712080	7713080	Which makes for awesome radio.
7713080	7716080	But, okay, here's the thing. Like, I...
7716080	7719080	I'm not a big dog person, right? I'm not a big fan of dogs.
7719080	7721080	I think they're kind of, like...
7721080	7725080	I was bit by one when I was five, and I've had, like, these weird symptoms ever since.
7725080	7731080	But, Alan showed me a video this week that makes me want a dog.
7731080	7735080	Like, seriously. Because this is the cutest dog I've ever seen in my life.
7735080	7737080	Okay? And you know what type of dog it is?
7737080	7738080	It's a Corgi.
7738080	7740080	I love Corgis!
7740080	7744080	And the video, if you want to look this up on YouTube, is called Corgi Flop.
7744080	7747080	And it's the most adorable thing I've ever seen in my entire life.
7747080	7749080	So, like, there's this little dog that goes in, and then they got...
7749080	7751080	Oh, wait, wait, oh, where's the Corgi?
7751080	7752080	Corgi!
7752080	7755080	Okay, so the dog and the person jump in, there goes the Corgi.
7755080	7756080	Corgi's like...
7756080	7759080	The Corgi, like, watches for a minute, and then the Corgi just...
7759080	7761080	At one point, the Corgi goes...
7761080	7763080	Come on, come on, do it, do it, do it, do it. Flop!
7765080	7766080	Those little legs.
7766080	7768080	They're so adorable!
7768080	7771080	Oh, and Rob, for the record, Corgis are very friendly dogs.
7771080	7774080	I know, I know, and a Corgi would never bite me.
7774080	7776080	That's something that, like, pit bulls do.
7776080	7779080	Corgis are just adorable, and they swim and everything.
7779080	7780080	You definitely should get...
7780080	7782080	Oops! Flop!
7782080	7787080	She'd definitely get a Pembroke Welsh Corgi, Rob.
7787080	7790080	Although that laughing sounds evil.
7790080	7792080	Let me link that in our chatroom there, so...
7792080	7794080	Because I apologize, that makes for terrible radio,
7794080	7797080	but I had to derail the show and just tell you about my experience where...
7797080	7800080	That's a big deal. For me to say I want a dog is, like, a huge deal.
7800080	7802080	Like, ask somebody who's known me for years and years.
7802080	7804080	Dark Sakura? Me saying I want a dog?
7804080	7805080	That's like...
7805080	7808080	Like, call hell and ask if they've got ice cream, because seriously...
7808080	7809080	Really, yeah.
7809080	7810080	Alright, anyhow...
7810080	7815080	It's like going into Rob's bedroom and finding an AK under his bed.
7815080	7817080	Pretty much.
7817080	7819080	Alright, anyhow, let's move on.
7819080	7823080	This is shocking news as well, actually.
7823080	7826080	I don't know, this is really dividing the community,
7826080	7830080	and this is news about Final Fantasy XIV
7830080	7834080	and what the game director Nobuaki Komodo said this week
7834080	7838080	about the 8 hour a week limit.
7838080	7840080	Yes, that's right.
7840080	7843080	What's happening is that apparently in Final Fantasy XIV,
7843080	7847080	once you've played a particular job class for 8 hours,
7847080	7850080	the amount of experience you start to earn decreases.
7850080	7854080	And once you've played for 15 hours, you're done.
7854080	7857080	You can't earn any more experience.
7857080	7860080	This is the reverse of what other games like World of Warcraft do, where...
7860080	7863080	Wait, is it just one job class? Can you switch classes to something else?
7863080	7865080	Yes, apparently you can.
7865080	7867080	But that's like, you know, if you remember Final Fantasy XI,
7867080	7869080	that's practically like doing a whole different character.
7869080	7870080	Completely different.
7870080	7873080	Here's a quote real quick about why this system is in place.
7873080	7876080	Quote, first off, the main concept behind Final Fantasy XIV
7876080	7879080	is allowing those players with little time on their hands to play effectively,
7879080	7881080	and game balance is based off of that.
7881080	7885080	Furthermore, it is being designed to not give those with more time on their hands
7885080	7888080	to play an unfair advantage.
7888080	7893080	And also we don't want people that play in, you know, say, you know,
7893080	7898080	was it those internet cafes in Hong Kong, you know, abandoning their children
7898080	7901080	and killing themselves over playing this game.
7901080	7905080	Because of that, systems such as Guardian's Favor, a bonus to guild levs,
7905080	7908080	have been implemented to make leveling in the short term easier
7908080	7910080	than leveling in the long term.
7910080	7916080	And of course there are tons of people just up in arms about this.
7916080	7918080	Like on the website going crazy.
7918080	7920080	Like you guys have got to be kidding me.
7920080	7923080	Who are you to tell me how long I can be playing these games?
7923080	7925080	Da da da da da. It's my money.
7925080	7929080	There's another thing though to consider is that if it's also on a per character basis,
7929080	7934080	it also sort of balances out the leveling.
7934080	7940080	I mean the, what's the word I'm thinking of, the hierarchy of levels
7940080	7945080	to where you're not going to have, you know, a week later maxed out characters.
7945080	7950080	You're going to have people that to really follow the incentive
7950080	7954080	that are going to be on a more even par so people move up together
7954080	7958080	and then they can start putting out content, you know, later on
7958080	7962080	for those people who hit those higher levels. Does that make sense?
7962080	7966080	A little bit. Now there was a translation that came out on the North America website
7966080	7968080	that helped to try to bring some clarity to this.
7968080	7972080	It's very lengthy. Let me try to give you the bullet points here.
7972080	7975080	We calculated a value for the amount of skill or experience points
7975080	7977080	that could be earned in a one hour period.
7977080	7981080	This theoretical value represents an hour spent engaged solely in combat,
7981080	7985080	left quests or any other activities that earn skill or experience points
7985080	7989080	and sets a threshold to delimiting how many of these points can be earned in a period of play.
7989080	7993080	Based on this, we have implemented a threshold value concept.
7993080	7996080	These thresholds are regulated by a one week timer
7996080	7999080	that begins counting down the instant you earn experience points.
7999080	8001080	After a week is passed, the thresholds will reset
8001080	8003080	and the moment skill experience points are earned again,
8003080	8005080	the timer begins counting down anew.
8005080	8008080	For the first eight thresholds during this week long period,
8008080	8011080	players will receive skill or experience points at the maximum rate
8011080	8016080	and then it goes on after that and then eventually reaches a rate of zero.
8016080	8020080	It is worth noting, however, that the reduced rate will also gradually recover
8020080	8024080	while players are engaged in activities that do not yield skill or experience points.
8024080	8028080	In this manner, it is possible for the threshold value to reset completely
8028080	8031080	even before the completion of the one week timer.
8031080	8034080	So in a nutshell, this is very convoluted,
8034080	8037080	but those of you that just plan to take three days off work
8037080	8040080	and play Final Fantasy XIV nonstop when this comes out
8040080	8043080	are going to be hitting this wall.
8043080	8047080	Yeah, but now they're talking about stuff that doesn't require skills.
8047080	8050080	So say, for example, I go and fight, fight, fight, fight,
8050080	8052080	and then burn out the whole thing.
8052080	8055080	Then I can go craft and that will kind of build it back.
8055080	8058080	I mean, I could spend a bunch of time like making food or something.
8058080	8061080	I don't know.
8061080	8063080	It's interesting. I mean, it's their game.
8063080	8065080	They can do what they want, but let me go back.
8065080	8068080	I've played the Final Fantasy XIV beta. It stinks.
8068080	8072080	And I'm sorry. I don't think they made a quick game at all.
8072080	8076080	It's harder, at least in the beta I played.
8076080	8079080	Again, it's been a couple months, or maybe a month.
8079080	8082080	But in the beta I played, it was much harder to go out and kill monsters
8082080	8086080	than just log in, warp, and click and go.
8086080	8089080	It honestly feels, and I'm really trying not to be biased,
8089080	8092080	but it feels like it was a lot faster in WoW,
8092080	8095080	or even Ion if you want to take a non-WoW game, or Guild Wars.
8095080	8098080	All those games seemed a lot easier to get going in
8098080	8100080	than it did Final Fantasy XIV.
8100080	8102080	For me, that's where the weirdness is of this,
8102080	8106080	is that they swear up and down they want to make this more casual MMO
8106080	8108080	and something you don't have to spend all this time playing,
8108080	8112080	but it just seems like the game itself is still Final Fantasy XI upgraded.
8112080	8114080	You know what I mean?
8114080	8116080	So, I don't know.
8116080	8117080	That'd be weird.
8117080	8118080	Bonds in our chat room says,
8118080	8120080	Good thing Warcraft does not do that.
8120080	8123080	Well, if you think about it, though, they do in a way.
8123080	8125080	They just do the reverse.
8125080	8129080	You get rewarded with double XP for the time you aren't playing
8129080	8131080	and you're logged out consecutively on a character,
8131080	8134080	and that's to help you catch up so that people can't get too far ahead.
8134080	8137080	So, it's just like it's more of a reward than a penalty,
8137080	8141080	and I think that seems to be where a lot of people are up in arms.
8141080	8143080	Ziba in our chat room says,
8143080	8144080	Guild Wars 2 all the way.
8144080	8147080	You know, I saw a video of Guild Wars 2 gameplay,
8147080	8149080	and I got to say, it looks pretty hot.
8149080	8151080	It looks very action-oriented.
8151080	8156080	Let me see if I can find that same video here, another quick YouTube.
8156080	8160080	Have either of you guys heard anything about Guild Wars 2 or seen any of this?
8160080	8161080	Nope.
8161080	8162080	A video came out of...
8162080	8164080	Yeah, I kind of got out of the Guild Wars thing, so...
8164080	8166080	Yeah, but this is so different.
8166080	8168080	Oh, here it is.
8168080	8170080	I think this is out of Gamescom.
8170080	8173080	Yeah, there we go.
8173080	8175080	Like, it's more of an...
8175080	8177080	This probably isn't the best video to show it off,
8177080	8179080	but it looks a lot more like action-based.
8179080	8181080	Very pretty.
8181080	8184080	This is some leaked video out of Gamescom we're watching here in studio
8184080	8186080	to see, like, the hit point numbers flying,
8186080	8187080	and this guy's dual-wielding.
8187080	8189080	It looks really cool.
8189080	8190080	I got to say.
8190080	8193080	I'll post that link in chat so you guys can look at the video that I'm looking at.
8193080	8195080	I think that's going to be a pretty neat game.
8195080	8197080	All right, anyway, moving on.
8197080	8199080	Dark Soccer, what else do you have for us in gaming news?
8199080	8203080	Well, in other stuff, we do have...
8203080	8206080	Now, this is not just gaming-related.
8206080	8210080	This is archaeology and anthropology,
8210080	8215080	and prehistoric biology.
8215080	8217080	So, like, Indiana Jones?
8217080	8218080	Hmm.
8218080	8220080	Lara Croft Tomb Raider?
8220080	8224080	Basically, on a Pacific island,
8224080	8230080	they found a giant turtle that they thought went extinct 50,000 years ago,
8230080	8233080	but apparently it still lived on.
8233080	8237080	So, in a 3,000-year-old site on the Nautu,
8237080	8239080	I guess it's how it's pronounced,
8239080	8246080	they found a type of turtle, a maolinid, I believe is how it's said,
8246080	8249080	that evolved 50 million years ago.
8249080	8255080	But now the funny thing about it is that when you look at it face-on,
8255080	8258080	it looks like King Koopa.
8258080	8259080	Seriously.
8259080	8264080	It's got the same facial shape,
8264080	8265080	the same...
8265080	8267080	And I'm not saying the old-school Koopa.
8267080	8270080	I'm saying the modern incarnation.
8270080	8273080	It's got that flat head and the horns.
8273080	8274080	What are you talking about?
8274080	8276080	That thing looks nothing like Dennis Hopper.
8276080	8277080	Get it?
8277080	8279080	Yes, I get it.
8279080	8283080	I know it's too soon, but they're both dead!
8283080	8285080	Wah-wah.
8285080	8287080	I'm going to actually link the story into the chat room,
8287080	8289080	because this is actually pretty cool.
8289080	8291080	I'd like to see what our chat room thinks about this.
8291080	8292080	A quick wire-in.
8292080	8293080	You know what it looks like?
8293080	8294080	It looks like...
8294080	8296080	Oh, God, what the hell's his name?
8296080	8297080	It looks fat, is what it looks like.
8297080	8301080	The big old turtle from Final Fantasy.
8301080	8303080	Oh, I know what you're talking about.
8303080	8304080	Yes, yes.
8304080	8305080	I know exactly what you're talking about,
8305080	8306080	and I forget the name, too.
8306080	8309080	Now, here's the question that's burning on my mind,
8309080	8310080	DarkSakura.
8310080	8313080	Was it a Koopa Troopa or a Para Koopa Troopa?
8313080	8314080	It's a King Koopa.
8314080	8315080	Oh, I see.
8315080	8317080	Seriously, look at that head.
8317080	8319080	That's an ugly sumbitch.
8319080	8321080	Well, maybe it's...
8321080	8323080	And Rama in chat says,
8323080	8326080	Zach, it's my ex-girlfriend.
8326080	8327080	You dated a turtle?
8327080	8332080	God, you're dumb.
8332080	8334080	Of course, I like following all the links on here.
8334080	8336080	What kind of weird kinky shit are you into?
8336080	8339080	Is it possible that Miyamoto just got inspiration
8339080	8342080	from, like, books on the Galapagos Islands or something?
8342080	8343080	You know, is it...
8343080	8344080	It could be.
8344080	8346080	I think we're reading way too much into this.
8346080	8347080	Yeah, I think you're right.
8347080	8350080	I mean, after all, it's the turtle that decided to evolve
8350080	8352080	into something that would become a video game.
8352080	8353080	That's why.
8353080	8355080	You know, we are thinking way too hard on this,
8355080	8357080	and, Loki, I demand a story about porn.
8357080	8358080	Help me out here.
8358080	8360080	A story about porn?
8360080	8361080	Well, you know what?
8361080	8363080	I think I can kind of help you out,
8363080	8365080	because Playboy is teaming up with Bigpoint
8365080	8369080	to form a new game label,
8369080	8371080	because, you know, they had some really awesome games
8371080	8374080	that came out way back in the day, I guess.
8374080	8375080	Now, this isn't about porn,
8375080	8381080	because you know you only subscribe to Playboy for the articles.
8381080	8385080	Anyways, they're teaming up with Bigpoint,
8385080	8386080	which is currently working on, I guess,
8386080	8388080	the Battlestar Galactica online game,
8388080	8390080	not having to do with porn,
8390080	8393080	and other free-to-play games on its own web portal.
8393080	8397080	It says Playboy will now also distribute through its own domain
8397080	8399080	some free-to-play games.
8399080	8403080	The first game to get the red cartman treatment is Poisonville.
8403080	8407080	I wonder if this is, like, Farmville, but with poison.
8407080	8409080	I play that.
8409080	8411080	Link is probably not safe for work.
8411080	8412080	Let's check it out.
8412080	8413080	Wait, they're teaming up with Playboy, though.
8413080	8417080	Why don't they make Boobville on Facebook?
8417080	8419080	Poisonville, let's see here.
8419080	8423080	And it's on the Playboy.com website, and...
8423080	8424080	Boobville, is this thing on?
8424080	8425080	It looks like Driver.
8425080	8426080	Boobs?
8426080	8427080	Boobville?
8427080	8431080	No, it looks like, almost like Driver.
8431080	8432080	I'm surprised.
8432080	8437080	There is no boobs to be seen at this point.
8437080	8438080	And the video's not playing,
8438080	8440080	so I can only assume that there's no boobs.
8440080	8443080	And I am very disappointed by that.
8443080	8445080	Although I do have to say, though,
8445080	8447080	in the background they have Pam Anderson
8447080	8449080	from Miss February 1990,
8449080	8453080	and she looks quite different now.
8453080	8456080	How could they just make a video game out of boobs,
8456080	8458080	you think, that would actually be entertaining?
8458080	8460080	They need a new Playboy the Mansion game.
8460080	8461080	Remember that?
8461080	8462080	Yes.
8462080	8463080	Oh, wait, here we go.
8463080	8464080	Here we go.
8464080	8465080	All right.
8465080	8468080	Playboy.com, and...
8468080	8469080	What is this game?
8469080	8471080	Chew the boobs in three, two, one.
8471080	8473080	No, it's some dude, and he's a...
8473080	8475080	Is that a chick?
8475080	8476080	That might be a chick.
8476080	8478080	Some chick just escaped from jail.
8478080	8479080	Oh, now she's picking up a...
8479080	8481080	A topless chick?
8481080	8483080	Oh, she's making out with some dude.
8483080	8485080	Oh, and she stole his car.
8485080	8489080	Now that sounds like a game changing.
8489080	8493080	I could do a GTA game starring, like, a badass chick.
8493080	8494080	Well, that's what it seems like so far.
8494080	8497080	Yeah, I'll play that.
8497080	8500080	And, uh, she's going into the ghetto.
8500080	8502080	There's all sorts of guys.
8502080	8505080	There's a guy that just did a roundhouse kick into a windshield
8505080	8506080	and broke the windshield.
8506080	8509080	That's really excessive.
8509080	8513080	And now she's teaming up with some really weird-looking bikers.
8513080	8516080	It's a bunch of, like, really kind of girl-powered chicks
8516080	8517080	with assault rifles.
8517080	8519080	So if you imagine, like, a Saints Row or...
8519080	8521080	Why is Playboy making this girl...
8521080	8525080	They throw her APB with, like, you know, lots of chicks and ski masks and stuff.
8525080	8528080	Look, look, I don't mean to sound, like, sexist or whatever,
8528080	8533080	but why is Playboy the home of women exploitation,
8533080	8535080	making this game that's now like,
8535080	8537080	Hey, the girl's in charge.
8537080	8539080	I'm Angelina Jolie.
8539080	8541080	I'm making out and stealing cars and all this stuff.
8541080	8544080	Like, I don't get it.
8544080	8545080	It looks neat.
8545080	8547080	I mean, if it's free-to-play, I might check it out
8547080	8549080	because, you know, it's kind of cool-looking.
8549080	8552080	But that's the trailer, which I'm sure has nothing to do
8552080	8554080	with the actual gameplay of the game.
8554080	8559080	And I gotta say, with a game that's, you know, on Playboy.com,
8559080	8562080	not a bit of nudity in there at all.
8562080	8564080	No nudity whatsoever.
8564080	8565080	Except for Pam Anderson in the background.
8565080	8566080	Poisonville.com.
8566080	8567080	Let's try that website.
8567080	8569080	Maybe there's nudity there.
8569080	8570080	Let's see.
8570080	8572080	We'll get lucky here.
8572080	8575080	Poisonville.com.
8575080	8576080	Let's see.
8576080	8579080	Toa Gak in our chat room says, GTA, girl take all.
8579080	8580080	Your shit.
8580080	8581080	In parentheses.
8581080	8582080	Nah, he's trying.
8582080	8583080	He's trying.
8583080	8584080	You need a better acronym than that.
8584080	8585080	Oh, oh, oh.
8585080	8586080	They've got the beta.
8586080	8587080	You can try this.
8587080	8589080	Free-to-play right now.
8589080	8590080	Someone sounds like an infomercial.
8590080	8591080	Are you on Playboy's payroll?
8591080	8595080	No, I'm on the Poisonville website.
8595080	8596080	But I gotta say, though,
8596080	8600080	I'm looking at all these different screenshots and stuff.
8600080	8601080	The screenshots look pretty good,
8601080	8604080	but the game has no nudity.
8604080	8608080	Therefore does not need to be on this website.
8608080	8613080	Now, if it's Playboy Mansion, the game, you know,
8613080	8616080	where it's kind of an adult version of Charlie's Angels
8616080	8620080	where heff is Charlie.
8620080	8623080	The girls next door of the game would be great.
8623080	8624080	Hello, angels.
8624080	8627080	I need you to pleasure me today.
8627080	8629080	That's how I kind of picture that game.
8629080	8631080	I just want a decent game with boobies.
8631080	8633080	Is that too much to ask?
8633080	8635080	Besides God of War.
8635080	8636080	All right.
8636080	8640080	Moving on, let's talk about something that definitely
8640080	8642080	doesn't have to do anything at all with boobies.
8642080	8644080	In fact, this is possibly the worst possible story
8644080	8646080	that could follow up on that last story.
8646080	8649080	It has to do with a new Nintendo DS game.
8649080	8652080	It's called Atari's Greatest Hits Volume 1.
8652080	8656080	It's 50 different games available to play on the Nintendo DS,
8656080	8661080	things from the Atari 2600 games such as Sword Quest,
8661080	8667080	Tempest, Outlaw, Dodge'em, Real Sports Football,
8667080	8670080	Starship, and basically all the same shit you see in Game Room, right?
8670080	8673080	And then there's some arcade hits including Pong and
8673080	8676080	Lunar Lander and Missile Command and all this.
8676080	8678080	I guess the one neat thing about this game,
8678080	8680080	it is a $30 cartridge, so you're kind of like,
8680080	8682080	oh, boy, what do I care?
8682080	8684080	The one neat thing about this game is that it does have
8684080	8686080	something Game Room doesn't have.
8686080	8688080	Single cartridge multiplayer.
8688080	8690080	20 titles in the game's collection.
8690080	8692080	I'm imagining some of them are single player and
8692080	8695080	don't have a reason to be shared like Adventure and Sword Quest.
8695080	8698080	But 20 of the games, you'll be able to share the game data
8698080	8701080	with another DS to do multiplayer.
8701080	8703080	That includes Space Duel and Pong.
8703080	8707080	And you'll be able to do the multiplayer DS with just one cartridge.
8707080	8710080	So I guess that's kind of cool, but at the same time,
8710080	8714080	I don't know, we got our retro fix with Game Room,
8714080	8716080	and if they would just add multiplayer,
8716080	8719080	maybe it would be better and so on and so forth.
8719080	8721080	There you go.
8721080	8723080	Hey, how about the mailbag?
8723080	8727080	Let's go to our mailbag at mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com.
8727080	8730080	Every week Dark Sakura dives into the mailbag head first,
8730080	8732080	picks out a couple emails that she thinks are worthy
8732080	8735080	of being read on the show, and then she reads them.
8735080	8736080	I do.
8736080	8737080	You do.
8737080	8739080	So Dark Sakura.
8739080	8743080	Well, first of all, I delete any email that's full of stupidity.
8743080	8744080	Just thought I'd say that.
8744080	8746080	Good for you.
8746080	8750080	So let me go on to the first of our beautiful,
8750080	8753080	gorgeous, fantastical emails.
8753080	8755080	I'll start with a shorty.
8755080	8756080	Greetings, OLR crew.
8756080	8758080	It's been a while, hasn't it?
8758080	8759080	I just want to say that I love the show.
8759080	8761080	Also, I saw Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,
8761080	8763080	and it's now my new favorite movie.
8763080	8766080	The video game references are hilarious.
8766080	8770080	The gay roommate is hilarious, and so are the seven evil exes.
8770080	8772080	I'm going to buy the book so I can see the backstory,
8772080	8774080	and I'm going to buy the game also.
8774080	8775080	So keep up the good work, OLR.
8775080	8777080	Love, Geekboy2424.
8777080	8781080	P.S. Those of you who get the reference from K.ON,
8781080	8784080	I give OLR a muy muy heart cannon.
8784080	8786080	Wow.
8786080	8787080	Well, thanks.
8787080	8788080	I'm glad you liked the movie.
8788080	8790080	I didn't think it was the best movie ever,
8790080	8794080	but it was, it tickled the retro funny bone, I suppose.
8794080	8796080	You know, all that stuff.
8796080	8797080	There you go.
8797080	8799080	Next one from Troy.
8799080	8800080	Hi.
8800080	8803080	Okay, apparently you sent two, so I'm going to actually go to the,
8803080	8805080	see if I can find the first one.
8805080	8807080	Okay, maybe not.
8807080	8809080	I'll just go ahead and read this one.
8809080	8813080	Sorry for the double email, but I thought this was funny.
8813080	8820080	Apparently you can buy Halo Reach early for 99,999 Microsoft points.
8820080	8822080	Oh, somebody didn't listen to last week's show yet
8822080	8823080	when they sent the email.
8823080	8824080	Yeah.
8824080	8826080	Talked to all about it on last week's show.
8826080	8828080	And no, you can't.
8828080	8830080	That's much cheaper than that now.
8830080	8831080	Is it?
8831080	8833080	Yeah. Free.
8833080	8835080	Oh, true.
8835080	8836080	True.
8836080	8839080	But you might get banned according to an article earlier in the show.
8839080	8841080	Ooh, this one's for me.
8841080	8842080	From you?
8842080	8843080	For me.
8843080	8844080	For you?
8844080	8845080	Well, let's hear it.
8845080	8846080	Hey, OLR.
8846080	8848080	I'm writing in with a food related question.
8848080	8850080	It's labeled Orange Lounge Foodio.
8850080	8854080	Um, food related questions, especially for, specifically for Jamie.
8854080	8856080	Apologies for sending this to the show inbox,
8856080	8858080	but I couldn't find a way of contacting her personally.
8858080	8859080	Wow.
8859080	8860080	Well, I'll go and read it.
8860080	8861080	Why not?
8861080	8862080	Jamie.
8862080	8864080	We haven't had a good food derailing yet.
8864080	8867080	I've been working my way to better health over the past few months.
8867080	8869080	With the help of persistent diet and exercise,
8869080	8872080	I've managed to gain a healthy 25 pounds.
8872080	8876080	However, I've hit a rut and stopped gaining weight for about three weeks now.
8876080	8878080	My body has become accustomed to my diet,
8878080	8882080	and I need to add more to it if I want to progress.
8882080	8886080	Do you have any suggestions as to what foods have high amounts of calories?
8886080	8887080	Hmm.
8887080	8889080	I've been including foods such as salmon, beef, and oats into my diet.
8889080	8892080	Anything with healthy fats and proteins will be appreciated as well.
8892080	8894080	Thank you so much in advance.
8894080	8895080	I love the show and keep up the good work.
8895080	8897080	I'm not going to read the person's name,
8897080	8899080	but I'm sure the person knows who it is.
8899080	8902080	Well, you're going to want to eat fried chicken and pizza.
8902080	8903080	No, Rob.
8903080	8904080	It's gaining weight.
8904080	8905080	That's how I gained weight.
8905080	8909080	The way that my uncle did it is he ate a lot of tuna.
8909080	8911080	A lot of tuna.
8911080	8915080	Um, you can also, um,
8915080	8920080	Now, keep in mind, I'm going more towards the opposite direction,
8920080	8923080	towards the, you know, lean tissue, the losing side.
8923080	8926080	Um, but you can eat, um,
8926080	8930080	Tempe is really good to get your protein from if you want a vegetarian source.
8930080	8935080	Um, tofu, um, but-
8935080	8937080	Beefcake 3000.
8937080	8939080	Beefcake!
8939080	8941080	If you're trying to go, like, the real food route,
8941080	8943080	I know that the way that my uncle did it is that instead of,
8943080	8947080	also instead of sucrose, he used, um, fructose as a sweetener,
8947080	8949080	because it's a more complex sugar.
8949080	8951080	And, you know, more whole wheat type stuff,
8951080	8953080	but I'd say lots of fish.
8953080	8954080	Lots of fish.
8954080	8955080	Go get sushi.
8955080	8957080	A lot of sashimi.
8957080	8960080	And, you know, I don't know if you've got a Fuddruckers where you are.
8960080	8962080	I haven't seen them out in that area, but maybe they do.
8962080	8964080	They have elk burgers, and they're super good.
8964080	8966080	You can get elk and game meat.
8966080	8969080	Like, you can get venison at some grocery stores.
8969080	8971080	You can probably go hunting for it.
8971080	8972080	I should put out this disclaimer.
8972080	8974080	Jamie's not a doctor, and neither am I.
8974080	8975080	I am not.
8975080	8978080	And you really should, if you want to make sure you're doing it the right way,
8978080	8979080	be under a doctor's care.
8979080	8981080	That's what I was gonna say wrong.
8981080	8982080	I'm just saying.
8982080	8983080	I was gonna say it.
8983080	8985080	I just don't want to get sued.
8985080	8987080	I'm not a doctor.
8987080	8989080	I'm showing you what I've read and what other-
8989080	8991080	But she plays one on the internet.
8991080	8993080	Dr. Sakura. No.
8993080	8995080	She's played a lot of Trauma Center.
8995080	8997080	Ugh, shut up.
8997080	9000080	Don't make me break out the vuvuzela.
9000080	9002080	Anyway.
9002080	9007080	I'm really just passing on to you what I've observed, what I've seen other people do.
9007080	9009080	Really the best thing to do.
9009080	9015080	Which is what I was getting to before Rob stood on the soapbox.
9015080	9017080	Is talk to your nutritionist.
9017080	9018080	Find a nutritionist.
9018080	9020080	Do some research.
9020080	9024080	I'll email you back with some of my own happenings.
9024080	9028080	I'll make sure that you get my contact information.
9028080	9030080	But, um.
9030080	9031080	But, yeah. I mean.
9031080	9037080	And, of course, make sure that you do not slack off on the exercise.
9037080	9039080	Change your routine.
9039080	9042080	Unless your goal is to get a bigger butt.
9042080	9045080	A trainer that I talked to just the other day, actually.
9045080	9051080	Said that if you start hitting a rut in your, um, like your-
9051080	9053080	And I was kind of actually thinking about this, too.
9053080	9055080	Because I used to do this with DDR.
9055080	9056080	Okay.
9056080	9060080	Is that if you feel something getting too easy.
9060080	9062080	And, you know.
9062080	9064080	You can change it up. Do something that's harder.
9064080	9066080	Because that's how you challenge yourself, right?
9066080	9070080	Well, someone was bringing it up at the gym just the other day.
9070080	9072080	And I was hearing them talk about it.
9072080	9075080	And I guess the same thing would apply.
9075080	9077080	You know.
9077080	9080080	I'm not a fitness coach.
9080080	9082080	And if all you really want is a bigger butt.
9082080	9084080	Dark Soccer was looking at some stuff before the show.
9084080	9086080	Booty Pop Panties.
9086080	9087080	Just look them up. Google them.
9087080	9089080	Booty Pop Panties.
9089080	9091080	They're $20 panties.
9091080	9092080	They give you a bigger butt?
9092080	9094080	They make your butt pop.
9094080	9095080	Alright.
9095080	9100080	And apparently according to Kelly Ripa, they're really comfortable to sit on.
9100080	9103080	Like I'd listen to anything that chick has to say.
9103080	9106080	Dear OLR, first of all, congrats to Loki on the new spawn.
9106080	9113080	I've seen the pictures and if the kid is in fact a white guy with red hair, I might suggest sunscreen. Lots.
9113080	9117080	I'm talking a container of sunscreen the size of a grain cellar.
9117080	9120080	Second, about the marathon show, I'd be up for it.
9120080	9123080	I haven't been able to listen live for a while because of school and working on my book.
9123080	9126080	But the concept of a marathon show intrigues me.
9126080	9130080	Just think of all the loopy incoherent chatter we could deliver around 8 AM.
9130080	9133080	It'll be like the old school DDR tournament shows.
9133080	9136080	If you want to hear some real train wreck radio, go look at the...
9136080	9139080	Go try to find the show. I don't even know if it was recorded at B3.
9139080	9143080	Where we did like... We had to do like 20 hours of programming across two days. It was crazy.
9143080	9147080	Or my favorite as well was the Shaft that we did.
9147080	9151080	Yes, it was called Sacramento hosts another fabulous tournament.
9151080	9153080	Oh, that's what we said it was.
9153080	9155080	Yes. That was hosted at Scandia.
9155080	9160080	And I just remember like I was emceeing the DDR freestyle.
9160080	9166080	And at certain points I'd look over and there was one point where it just looked like Loki was rambling incoherently into the microphone.
9166080	9167080	Like I don't even know what he was saying.
9167080	9172080	And then at one point Jahi... God, I love that guy. I don't know where he's at these days.
9172080	9175080	But Jahi, like I remember looking over and he had the mic just by himself.
9175080	9177080	And he was just going like this...
9177080	9181080	Like yelling into the microphone. It seemed like I'm like...
9181080	9184080	Who's listening to him right now? Poor people.
9184080	9185080	I love Jahi.
9185080	9186080	Oh yeah. Good times.
9186080	9191080	By the way, just to note for anyone who owns an iPad, buy a Bluetooth wireless keyboard.
9191080	9199080	It is a better keyboard than the virtual keyboard on the iPad, doesn't move out of place like the keyboard that hooks into the iPad dock, and can be found online for 40 bucks.
9199080	9201080	Again, I own an iPad.
9201080	9204080	That's the face he made. The P.
9204080	9205080	So it went...
9205080	9207080	Staycare Redertainment.
9207080	9212080	This message has been brought to you by the Black Robin Christmas Carol. Insert self-indulgent plug here.
9212080	9214080	Sent from my iPad. Ha!
9214080	9216080	Last email, Rob?
9216080	9218080	No, actually we got two.
9218080	9220080	Oh, here's the other part from Troy. Sorry.
9220080	9227080	Hey there, OLR. I don't entirely know if you guys know how to love a cat or even if you have a pet, but you should watch this.
9227080	9231080	Oh, it's 100 Ways to Love a Cat.
9231080	9233080	Well, I'll watch it later.
9233080	9234080	I'll watch it later.
9234080	9236080	I have a cat. I have a Shermie.
9236080	9238080	She likes to be loved with food.
9238080	9240080	Um...
9240080	9242080	Okay, here's the last one.
9242080	9244080	Hi, OLR folks.
9244080	9245080	Hi.
9245080	9246080	Rob.
9246080	9250080	What? I'm gonna respond back. If they say hi, I gotta say hi back. I don't wanna be rude.
9250080	9254080	Hi, OLR folks. There was something that a friend of mine said to me that really bothered me.
9254080	9256080	He said I wasn't a hardcore gamer.
9256080	9259080	I was quite hurt by that because I always thought I was a hardcore gamer.
9259080	9263080	I have a PS3, Wii, DS, First Generation, Dreamcast, Gameboy Color, and N64.
9263080	9264080	I still win.
9264080	9266080	All with their original boxes.
9266080	9271080	I've got figurines from Soul Calibur 2, a resin statue from Space Channel 5, Mounds and Mounds of Video Games,
9271080	9273080	sheet music, a few video game reference t-shirts,
9273080	9278080	and even my screensaver and desktop wallpapers are from EchoChrome and I don't even owe the game.
9278080	9280080	Do you think I'm still a hardcore gamer?
9280080	9282080	Um...
9282080	9284080	Gamer is what you play, not what you own.
9284080	9285080	No, you're just a pussy.
9285080	9288080	Game is what you play, not what you own.
9288080	9292080	Your friend is clearly just elitist.
9292080	9293080	Jealous.
9293080	9294080	Yeah, he's just a hater.
9294080	9295080	He's judging you.
9295080	9297080	You know what? We have a saying.
9297080	9299080	And the saying goes like this.
9299080	9300080	Haters gonna hate.
9300080	9301080	And your friend is a hater.
9301080	9303080	And all he's gonna do is he's gonna hate.
9303080	9304080	He's judging.
9304080	9305080	Yeah, that's right.
9305080	9306080	He's judging.
9306080	9307080	Stop judging.
9307080	9308080	Right.
9308080	9309080	A quick bit of history about me.
9309080	9312080	I grew up as a 90s gamer when I was in my teens, like the rest of us.
9312080	9315080	I was all about fighting games, among other genres,
9315080	9319080	and there was no shortage of Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat clones.
9319080	9323080	The same was side-scrolling beat-em-up games like Simpsons Arcade and X-Men,
9323080	9325080	to the X-Men game was great.
9325080	9327080	My friend is constantly trying to get me to play Left 4 Dead,
9327080	9330080	and even though I don't have an Xbox 360, nor do I want one,
9330080	9333080	the reason I don't want to play it is because I suck at first-person shooters,
9333080	9337080	and I end up getting killed when I try to fight against more seasoned gamers,
9337080	9338080	except for Portal.
9338080	9339080	See, your friend's a hater.
9339080	9341080	I can't wait for the sequel to come out.
9341080	9344080	For the record, the sequel is spelled S-E-Q-U-E-L, not A-L.
9344080	9348080	For the past few years, FPSers have been all the rage.
9348080	9350080	There have been Halo clones left and right,
9350080	9353080	so I guess my question is, does not liking a certain genre
9353080	9358080	that seems to currently be the most popular make you someone less of a gamer?
9358080	9360080	Thank you for reading my email, Stan.
9360080	9362080	No, it doesn't.
9362080	9365080	Your friend is just being a dick.
9365080	9367080	Okay, can I play devil's advocate for a minute?
9367080	9368080	Go for it.
9368080	9371080	I think everybody in chat is in agreeance that his friend's just being a jerk
9371080	9374080	and a hater, and I think we're all saying that too,
9374080	9376080	but let me ask you this.
9376080	9381080	Using this same logic, is somebody that plays Facebook games
9381080	9388080	and Farmville and Bejeweled Blitz and Imagine Cat Shop and Just Dance,
9388080	9390080	are they a gamer?
9390080	9393080	I don't think Facebook games count.
9393080	9394080	Really?
9394080	9401080	Now, if you're playing Bejeweled on a handheld system, that's a game.
9401080	9404080	See, okay, well, here's the definition.
9404080	9407080	You've got your casual games, right?
9407080	9412080	Which, they're technically, yes, they're games.
9412080	9418080	But I think that the actual definition of gamer as far as what is socially considered a gamer
9418080	9422080	has to do specifically with PC and console games.
9422080	9427080	Not flash-based games, if you know what I mean,
9427080	9434080	but, like, installing said game on hard drive playing, you know, against people.
9434080	9438080	The more, the higher intensity stuff.
9438080	9445080	I think multiplayer games, you know, again, installed content, console type things,
9445080	9449080	yes, those count. That's a gamer.
9449080	9456080	But if you play mostly puzzlers and things, you're gonna be looped into that casual category.
9456080	9462080	And I think that hardcore, if I'm gonna even go a bit further into generalizations,
9462080	9475080	we're looking at a very, what's the word that I'm thinking of, gender related type of theme.
9475080	9481080	I think I can, I wanna try and nail down this definition a lot quicker.
9481080	9485080	I think a gamer is someone who has an appreciation for game culture.
9485080	9487080	It's a gaming enthusiast.
9487080	9491080	If you enter the trouble to download this podcast and email it,
9491080	9494080	you care about games enough, I think you're a gamer.
9494080	9498080	If you have ever bought a gaming magazine off the shelf,
9498080	9500080	you have an interest in gaming culture, you're a gamer.
9500080	9502080	We do have non-gamers that listen, by the way.
9502080	9508080	And that's possible, sure. We probably have a lot of food fans at the rate this show's going.
9508080	9515080	If you are somebody who has ever watched a television program about video games
9515080	9519080	because you are interested in the content, you're probably a gamer.
9519080	9523080	I think a gamer is just somebody who has an active interest in gaming culture.
9523080	9528080	And somebody who does Farmville and That's It probably really isn't a gamer
9528080	9532080	because they don't have an interest in the culture of games and why we play them.
9532080	9533080	They're someone that just plays games.
9533080	9536080	And what motivates us and what keeps our interest, you know what I mean?
9536080	9542080	Well, it's like, you know, the other definition of gamer is, of course, tabletop.
9542080	9548080	But, you know, it's like I can sit down, when I play Monopoly, am I playing a game?
9548080	9551080	I'm playing as much of a game as I am playing Street Fighter.
9551080	9553080	It's a game. It's for entertainment.
9553080	9556080	But I don't collect Monopoly memorabilia.
9556080	9560080	So, I'm not a board gamer, I guess.
9560080	9566080	That's what I'm trying to look at it is by, and to put it back to this way,
9566080	9570080	it's not what you have, it's what you do with it.
9570080	9572080	Okay, that sounded dirty.
9572080	9575080	It's the games that you have, the games that you enjoy.
9575080	9580080	And if you play them all the time, that's pretty hardcore, you know.
9580080	9585080	And if you make it a part of your life, like you were saying,
9585080	9588080	if you make it a part of your life, then you're a gamer.
9588080	9590080	And your friend's a hater.
9590080	9593080	And your friend's a hater. Your friend's just judging you.
9593080	9594080	All right.
9594080	9597080	And Tigerclaw in our chatroom says this.
9597080	9601080	If this so-called friend had been saying that, all that, then that is not a friend at all.
9601080	9607080	You get the impression that they don't want to be around you just because you like games that they don't.
9607080	9609080	I don't know if it's necessarily that severe,
9609080	9614080	but your friend just kind of, in regards to this topic, needs to pull his head out of his butt.
9614080	9615080	Tiara told me something funny.
9615080	9616080	What's that?
9616080	9621080	If you're playing Monopoly, you may not be a board gamer, you might be a board gamer.
9621080	9624080	Ah, play on words.
9624080	9627080	She's a grammar enthusiast. All right.
9627080	9628080	Anyhow.
9628080	9631080	I get pretty bored once, you know, all the big streets are bought up.
9631080	9632080	Is that it for the mailbag?
9632080	9633080	It's over!
9633080	9636080	Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
9636080	9637080	The mailbag is closed.
9637080	9643080	It's time for us to do a little bit of ranting in a segment we like to call The F-Years of the Week.
9643080	9668080	I have a number of FUs, but one of them is...
9668080	9671080	What was I ranting about when you guys came in today?
9671080	9673080	I don't remember.
9673080	9675080	I don't remember.
9675080	9677080	I don't remember.
9677080	9678080	Just...
9678080	9682080	When I came in here, you were talking about those booty shorts.
9682080	9683080	Well, okay.
9683080	9690080	I've got a lot of really good stuff happening to me this week, so I'd say FU to not having enough time.
9690080	9694080	And stupid drivers!
9694080	9700080	I also say an FU to lack of time, especially since I have to take care of the baby and I don't sleep very much anymore.
9700080	9705080	I go to bed at, like, 11 and I have to wake up again to feed him.
9705080	9712080	Like, last night, I actually was trying to go to bed at, like, 9 because I anticipate getting up way early in the morning.
9712080	9721080	And so I tried to put him down at 10 and he just kept fussing and would not go to sleep until about midnight.
9721080	9728080	And that sucked and I had to get up again every couple hours and then wake up usually with him around 4 o'clock in the morning.
9728080	9734080	Or 5 o'clock in the morning, sometimes 6 o'clock in the morning, and we're up until I have to go to work.
9734080	9739080	So, you know, multiply that times infinite.
9739080	9741080	And it really sucks.
9741080	9746080	But just the lack of time to actually get to work on my grandpa thought of mods and stuff like that.
9746080	9749080	And also an FU to just plain shitty drivers.
9749080	9751080	I was behind this old...
9751080	9753080	Well, I thought it was an old man. I ended up being an old woman.
9753080	9759080	But she was obviously lost and didn't know where she was going or she was looking for a turn of some sort.
9759080	9763080	And so she was driving really slow and then finally it was funny and kind of ironic.
9763080	9768080	Blew through a red light and then it got caught by the red light camera.
9768080	9774080	So a little bit of karma justice there, but I just hate people that do that kind of stuff.
9774080	9775080	Or just blow through stop signs.
9775080	9777080	I ran into somebody in a parking lot.
9777080	9781080	Well, they didn't really run into them, but they just blew right through the stop sign.
9781080	9783080	Like, oh, it doesn't apply to me.
9783080	9789080	So, you know, FU to those people and FU to the stupid young modders on sevensins.com.
9789080	9795080	Because, my God, you treat this shit like it's high school with all the fucking drama and stuff.
9795080	9799080	Some people are asking questions and you're like, well, I'm too good to answer your fucking questions.
9799080	9802080	So, you know, fuck them.
9802080	9806080	And fuck you for deleting my post just because I'm explaining how to do things.
9806080	9810080	Because you want to claim to be the first person that's ever done this thing.
9810080	9814080	Maybe you should stop hanging on web forums with fourteen and fifteen year old boys.
9814080	9817080	Well, I try not to, but it's very limited.
9817080	9825080	You know, modding the Xbox 360 version of Grand Theft Auto, it's very limited in the amount of message boards out there for that.
9825080	9831080	Trust me, if there was a different source, a more mature forum that I could go to, I would love to be there.
9831080	9835080	Do you think anyone from that forum might listen to this show and just go post over there?
9835080	9836080	No, I don't care.
9836080	9840080	This asshole on this internet radio station.
9840080	9841080	I really don't care.
9841080	9845080	My FU of the week, really not hard to figure out this week.
9845080	9850080	I'm a little angsty and would like to give a big FU to the fact that my trip got cancelled.
9850080	9859080	And it wasn't just the fact that a plane caught fire, but it was the fact that, you know, we ended up getting rerouted to another flight that was delayed for like three hours.
9859080	9862080	And it's kind of like they could have given us a better heads up about the delay.
9862080	9863080	I was a little irritated.
9863080	9866080	Some parts of that situation just seemed preventable.
9866080	9873080	I'm a pretty resilient person, and I like to think I was able to let that situation kind of roll off my back as kind of like one of those funny life experiences.
9873080	9879080	But I did feel really bad for my friend, who it was supposed to be a birthday trip for her, and it's just, you know, really bummed out about it.
9879080	9881080	And I can understand.
9881080	9883080	Kind of sucks to have that happen.
9883080	9887080	So, just FU to shit happening.
9887080	9889080	Because sometimes it does.
9889080	9893080	Shit happens, or anything you can do about it.
9893080	9895080	Alright, meanwhile, back to the show.
9895080	9898080	Couple news stories for you guys, and then the Skypline!
9898080	9900080	Yes, it's kind of interesting.
9900080	9904080	There is a whole trademark dispute over Mafia Wars.
9904080	9912080	Digital Chocolate is claiming that they had the trademark Mafia Wars for their, I believe it's an iPhone game.
9912080	9918080	And then of course, you know, Zynga has their Mafia Wars game that came out later on.
9918080	9921080	That was on Facebook and PC and whatnot.
9921080	9929080	And of course, now, you know, their Mafia Wars game has all sorts of different marketing with, you know, 7-Eleven and that kind of stuff.
9929080	9938080	It says, um, the United States Patent and Trademark Office lists Zynga's first filing date for the game under the name Mafia Wars as July 1, 2009.
9938080	9949080	Although no filing under that name could be located with Digital Chocolate as the applicant, Digital Chocolate has not responded, of course, to the request by Joystick in this case.
9949080	9952080	Um, of course, you know, it's...
9952080	9958080	I don't know if it's a case that they didn't trademark the name, which would kind of suck for them.
9958080	9963080	But, I mean, the game did clearly come out before the Zynga version of Mafia Wars.
9963080	9966080	So, you know, they're going to court over that now.
9966080	9968080	Settlement. Yeah.
9968080	9973080	It's where these things always end up. Some type of out-of-court settlement. I'm sure.
9973080	9975080	Alright.
9975080	9979080	Anyhow, one more story for you guys. I guess I should get that Skype line ready to go, shouldn't I?
9979080	9984080	Alright, uh, 1877 game O-L-R, username is skypeazorgen. I don't know if you want to start calling.
9984080	9986080	But meanwhile, I got one more song...er, one more song.
9986080	9992080	One more story for you guys and this is very interesting and it's one of those things I looked at and I was like, really? Is this real life?
9992080	9993080	I don't even know.
9993080	9995080	What is this? I cannot even.
9995080	10002080	It's a game called The Bible Online. That's right. This is real.
10002080	10014080	It's a game called The Bible Online where you will get to slip into the role of Abraham and his descendants and have the opportunity to reenact and witness the incidents of their times.
10014080	10018080	The game will be split into chapters. The heroes will be the first one that comes out.
10018080	10024080	It's basically an MMO strategy game. You control your own tribe, you build a city, you wage war in the name of God.
10024080	10034080	I see why I mean, like, this almost sounds like a joke. Like, I just don't even get it but apparently there's a website. It's thebible-onlinegame.com.
10034080	10041080	Complete with side quests, role-playing elements and, uh, there you go. That's what it's all about.
10041080	10047080	No word yet if there's gonna be, you know, other religious texts. Um, what?
10047080	10051080	Have you actually looked at the screen captures on it? I did.
10051080	10052080	Yeah?
10052080	10053080	It's super dinky.
10053080	10057080	I almost think it, like, it's not real. Like, I just...
10057080	10058080	No, it is. It's real.
10058080	10059080	Wow.
10059080	10065080	There's a beta sign up. It's just, it's dinky. It's like, it reminds me even of a, like, a late 90s strategy game.
10065080	10066080	Where's Bibleville?
10066080	10073080	What? Are they gonna have a, uh, the Quran online? Are they gonna, are they gonna be equal opportunity and do a Quran online?
10073080	10075080	No.
10075080	10078080	Just don't put it too close to ground zero.
10078080	10084080	Anyhow. Moving on. Are you making food? Are you making me food?
10084080	10085080	Do you want a taco?
10085080	10086080	I don't want a taco. I'm fine.
10086080	10088080	I've been sitting here hungry.
10088080	10089080	Then make a taco.
10089080	10090080	Watching Linky eat.
10090080	10092080	Fine. I'll take calls without you.
10092080	10095080	I'll be in here a pack of taco. I'm also making my taco. Do you want me to make you a taco?
10095080	10096080	No, I don't want a taco.
10096080	10097080	Then fine. I'll be right back.
10097080	10098080	Fine.
10098080	10099080	Taco!
10099080	10100080	Do you want to send Dan in? Maybe Dan wants to talk to some listeners.
10100080	10102080	Dan, you wanna talk to some listeners?
10102080	10104080	Let's just have Dan answer the phones tonight.
10104080	10107080	Dan, come answer the phones.
10107080	10109080	He's busy playing something.
10109080	10110080	What's he playing? Do you know?
10110080	10111080	I don't know.
10111080	10112080	Oh, he's coming.
10112080	10113080	What are you playing?
10113080	10115080	Hey Dan. Dan, you wanna answer the phones tonight?
10115080	10116080	Yes.
10116080	10117080	Alright, Skypline with Dan.
10117080	10121080	Alright, so you're just gonna say, hi, this is Orange Lounge Radio. This is Dan. What do you want?
10121080	10122080	Okay, just fear me.
10122080	10129080	Alright, here we go. Skypline with Dan tonight. 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
10129080	10130080	You ready to go to the phones, Dan?
10130080	10131080	Let's do it.
10131080	10134080	Here we go. Here's the first call.
10134080	10137080	Hello, this is Orange Lounge Radio. Sup?
10137080	10141080	Hey, this is DJ Blaziken.
10141080	10143080	This is who?
10143080	10145080	DJ Blaziken.
10145080	10146080	DJ Blaziken.
10146080	10147080	DJ Blaziken.
10147080	10152080	Oh, good. Good to hear from you. What's up, man? How you doing? What can we do for you?
10152080	10158080	Uh, it's not much. I just got done with a Silent Hill in the dark session.
10158080	10160080	Wow.
10160080	10164080	Creepy as hell. Even though despite I unplugged my 60s audio cables...
10164080	10166080	Now the question is, did you have surround sound?
10166080	10176080	Um, I'm playing Homecoming for the 360 and I actually unplugged the 360 audio cables and plugged in my PSP audio cables for the stream.
10176080	10180080	And so basically I'm listening to you guys while playing Silent Hill.
10180080	10189080	I kind of get rid of the sound of the creepiness, but monsters coming out of the woodwork nowhere makes you jump out of my chair.
10189080	10193080	It's a giant mistake because Silent Hill is well known for its incredible sound design.
10193080	10199080	You play that on, like, surround sound system in the dark, it's going to fuck you up for life.
10199080	10203080	Oh, trust me. I've been screwed for life by Silent Hill years ago.
10203080	10206080	Yeah, I trust you, but I don't really want to hear about it.
10206080	10211080	No, no, no. It was back on the old PlayStation 1. I played it probably... I played a demo.
10211080	10213080	Hey, I'm in the middle of a call.
10213080	10223080	The demo of Silent Hill 1 basically creeped me the heck out when I was, like, 10. Okay?
10223080	10228080	You know, you probably shouldn't have been playing that when you were 10. It must mean your parents don't care about you.
10228080	10232080	I gotta go. I'm being kicked out of the room.
10232080	10233080	All right.
10233080	10236080	It's good to hear from you. And, uh...
10236080	10237080	Give me that!
10237080	10238080	Stay black.
10238080	10239080	What?
10239080	10243080	Give me the call. Take care. Bye. I don't know. Bye.
10243080	10248080	That's my husband. I have to live with this.
10248080	10253080	Did he really just end that call with, stay black? Is that...
10253080	10258080	I don't even...
10258080	10263080	Did it occur to you that he's not black, Dan?
10263080	10270080	All right. Moving on. Let's take another call. I guess Dan left the room. Let's move on.
10270080	10272080	Hi, here on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
10272080	10279080	This is Ron Mudd. I want to know... Did you do that on purpose or what? I mean, really. That was just excellent timing.
10279080	10281080	Do what on purpose?
10281080	10284080	Rob, you know exactly what I'm talking about. No chat room knows.
10284080	10289080	Oh. No, but I would have closed the phone call with that if you want, but...
10289080	10296080	Actually, Dan just yelled from the living room, Rama, stay black.
10296080	10298080	Tell him to stay white.
10298080	10307080	You know, Rama says to stay white. You know, I didn't think that was something that could be changed very easily unless you're like Ted Danson at a, you know...
10307080	10309080	I think it has to do with those old 70s movies.
10309080	10310080	All right, well...
10310080	10314080	Because keep in mind, it's like the Hebrew hammer. There's a line, Shlomo, stay Jewish.
10314080	10320080	Once in a while, it's a video game talk show. I don't know if you've played any games this week, Rama, but...
10320080	10327080	I have. I have been playing Scott Pilgrim vs. the World for the last four to five days.
10327080	10333080	You know, I played the demo actually this week. I didn't talk about it because I got consumed with the Laura Croft game, but what do you think?
10333080	10340080	Anyone that loves River City Ransom, get your ass on Xbox Live or PlayStation Network and get this game. That's it.
10340080	10344080	It really, it's just River City Ransom 2, isn't it? It really is.
10344080	10353080	With all the gaming references, my God. I mean, I'm a type of person where I will play through a game and like, I'm pretty much done with it, won't pick it up again.
10353080	10365080	I fl, first day, me and my roommate, we finished the game in four and a half hours. Couple of days later, I jump on the game and plow right through it, and I played through the game again last night to like 4.30 in the morning.
10365080	10371080	It's a good time. That's like me on the Laura Croft game, but obviously this is, you know, for different reasons.
10371080	10376080	Is it just the nostalgia factor that's getting you, or are you really having fun just kind of button mashing and beating them up?
10376080	10382080	All of that. I mean, hell, I actually went out and bought an arcade fighter joystick just to play this game with.
10382080	10383080	Wow.
10383080	10386080	And I just automatically adjusted to the joystick and played through the game.
10386080	10387080	That is hardcore.
10387080	10388080	Yes.
10388080	10402080	That's awesome. Well, tell us a little bit about how the game kind of changes as it progresses, because something I noticed, like, in the demo I was playing, I was like, okay, well, this is kind of, you know, repetitive, it's button mashing, da-da-da.
10402080	10405080	But then I noticed, like, as you level up, oh, you start getting new moves.
10405080	10406080	Yes.
10406080	10412080	And then as you go into the shops, you can kind of enhance the strength and so forth. Does that kind of evolution continue as you move on?
10412080	10421080	Yes, something like that. Like, as every level goes on, the game gets progressively harder and harder, but you get more coins and more money.
10421080	10426080	Okay. So did you beat the game, or are you done with the game yet?
10426080	10436080	Yeah, me and my roommate, we finished the game, then I went through and beat the game twice, so I got two more times to go through the game so I can unlock the hidden character.
10436080	10441080	Ah, I was going to ask what the incentive is for multiple replay, but it's hidden characters then.
10441080	10451080	That, and when I looked at the lead divorce of my friends, I was determined to pretty much get to the top of the ladder out of my friends list, which I did.
10451080	10457080	Last I recall, I'm ranked, like, 2200, and everybody else is, like, in the 4000s.
10457080	10461080	That still means there's 2199 people better than you.
10461080	10465080	That means I'm going to have to go through every single one of them to get to the top.
10465080	10466080	That's right.
10466080	10473080	Number one guy has, like, over nine million dollars in the game on the vault. I've got my work cut out for myself.
10473080	10477080	It's a good thing he's not playing Final Fantasy XIV, or he would have got cut off by now.
10477080	10481080	Alright, any other thoughts for our listeners tonight, Rama, before I take some more calls?
10481080	10490080	I was going to talk about the whole online passing, but we'll save that for another time, because that's, like, another ten minutes of me ranting and losing my mind.
10490080	10495080	Alright, well, no problem. I'm sure there'll sadly be more stories on it as we move on.
10495080	10498080	There's folks asking for your gamertag in chat, so you might want to share.
10498080	10501080	Oh, I'll type it out in the chat room right now.
10501080	10506080	Alright, well, Rama, thank you so much for calling in. Have a great week, and of course, stay black, my friend.
10506080	10507080	L'chaim!
10507080	10508080	Alright, take care.
10511080	10515080	Let's go to the phones and take another call. Hi, you're on...
10515080	10517080	I had my mouth full of taco.
10517080	10520080	You had your mouth full? Was that a taco left? Alright, I've got another call.
10520080	10522080	Hi, you're on Ordnance Launch Radio. Who's this?
10522080	10523080	Hey, it's Tiara.
10523080	10526080	Tiara, my friend. Long time, no chat. How are you?
10526080	10528080	I'm doing very good. How are you?
10528080	10531080	I am great, but I'd be better if I was in Vegas.
10531080	10539080	Oh, yeah, and speaking of Vegas, the reason I called is because I have to tell you about the This is Vegas game.
10539080	10540080	Yes.
10540080	10546080	The reason that they're not making it anymore is because I had to send out a cease and desist letter because they were copying my life.
10546080	10547080	What?
10547080	10556080	Yeah, I mean, I didn't mind, you know, the dancing, the gambling, you know, going out on the strip, but when they got to the part with punching people, I had to draw a line.
10556080	10563080	I see. So, basically, because it was an unauthorized biography of Tiara, you had to cease and desist them.
10563080	10564080	Exactly.
10564080	10568080	Ruining gamer dreams everywhere. How dare you?
10568080	10573080	I know. I also had to put a stop on Boobville, so that's the reason there's no Boobville.
10573080	10576080	Damn it! You ruined everything!
10576080	10584080	I'm also angry with you because I did not know that there was a Price is Right game on Facebook until you posted about that.
10584080	10590080	I didn't know about it until I posted about it. I mean, maybe I played once or twice, but yes, there is a Price is Right game on Facebook.
10590080	10597080	Yeah, and I played it, and I played it for a while, and it was like, it sucked up a couple of hours of my life because it's kind of addicting.
10597080	10601080	It is very addicting, which is weird because it's kind of stupid.
10601080	10602080	It really is.
10602080	10613080	And I'm like, this game is so stupid, but I keep hoping that I'll get picked to play Clock Game, and then I'm like, ooh, if I get to level 5, I'll get to unlock a new pricing game, and I'm really excited about that.
10613080	10615080	Why? Because I'm a sad person.
10615080	10616080	Do you have Plinko?
10616080	10623080	Not yet. All they have, all I ever see, well, the game is still in beta, but all I ever see is Clock Game and Safe Crackers.
10623080	10625080	Yeah, I always get Safe Crackers.
10625080	10642080	There's another one you get to unlock at level 5, but I have found that I am a terrible shopper. I have yet to be called up to play a pricing game, but, but, but, this is important, I am an awesome wheel spinner, and I almost always get 95 cents or a dollar, just saying.
10642080	10659080	Oh, nice. Yeah, I always weigh underbid. Like, the things that they are selling, or that they have for bid, it's like, nobody's going to pay as much money as the game says, and it seems like it's way more overpriced than the actual Prices Right television show, you know?
10659080	10672080	You just have to remember, real people like you and me shop at places like IKEA and Target, and the Prices Right apparently buys all of their stuff at the Galleria, you know, Versace, and all that good stuff.
10672080	10674080	Apparently so, yeah.
10674080	10675080	They shop at Whole Foods.
10675080	10677080	Anyways, I just wanted to call and say hi.
10677080	10678080	Well, thank you so much for the phone call.
10678080	10681080	I'll tell you the story behind the This is Vegas.
10681080	10688080	Well, I appreciate it. I wish you would stop ruining the dreams of gamers everywhere, but maybe you'll let us have something fun in the future?
10688080	10692080	Well, you guys can come down to Vegas, and I'll show you around.
10692080	10698080	You know what I would love to do if I don't have anything else planned this year? I would love to take, like, a Christmas trip to Vegas.
10698080	10700080	Yeah, that would be fun.
10700080	10703080	Christmas ain't no big deal to you anymore, right? Let's go.
10703080	10711080	I actually, depending on if I get a certain house, oh, I'm shopping for a house, so if I get one with an extra bedroom, you could probably even crash.
10711080	10712080	That would be awesome.
10712080	10721080	Oh, yes, and just so the chat knows, yes, Tiara has some type of clicking sound in the background. We'll just say Clicky the pen is trying to infiltrate Orange Lounge Radio. We'll just leave it at that. I don't know what that's all about.
10721080	10722080	Damn Clicky.
10722080	10723080	Damn Clicky.
10723080	10725080	It returned. The ghost was Clicky past.
10725080	10733080	Yeah, I don't know. This mic is very, very crazy with the clicking. Sometimes it comes up, sometimes it just randomly disappears.
10733080	10741080	I think it's actually the doctor is coming to kidnap me, and it's the sonic screwdriver, but it's malfunctioning, so it makes a Clicky noise instead of a...
10741080	10744080	Well, you did get possessed by the Daleks earlier.
10744080	10750080	I thought maybe it was like, you know, she's like Bob Dole where she clutches the pen all day, and she's just clicking it because she's nervous about...
10750080	10754080	Well, you missed when she got invaded by Daleks earlier.
10754080	10755080	Yeah.
10755080	10756080	Is that on the other...
10756080	10757080	We were recording our other podcast.
10757080	10761080	Am I allowed to talk about that? Oh, you just did, so I can't.
10761080	10765080	We're doing another podcast. You're going to plug it?
10765080	10767080	Is it the Giggling Girl comic show again?
10767080	10772080	Yeah, it kind of is, except for there's a dude now, so it's two giggling girls and a dude.
10772080	10773080	Giggling dude.
10773080	10775080	Men ruining everything.
10775080	10778080	Where can I get it? Where can I download it? Is it ready?
10778080	10786080	It's going to be on EnfamousGamers.com, and that's Enfamous without an I, so N-F-A-M-O-U-S Gamers dot com.
10786080	10789080	EnfamousGamers. Sounds good. All right.
10789080	10796080	Well, Tiara, thanks so much for your call. Good luck with the podcast since Dark Soccer is on, and I'm sure it'll be a challenge.
10796080	10802080	But I'm kidding, I'm kidding. Oh, you should see the death stare. I just got it. It was pretty awesome.
10802080	10804080	You owe me ice cream.
10804080	10809080	I don't eat ice cream. Good luck. There's your ice cream. All right.
10809080	10813080	Tiara, thank you so much for your phone call. Stay black, and we'll talk to you next time.
10813080	10814080	All right, thanks.
10814080	10815080	All right, take care.
10815080	10822080	1-877-KMOLR. Are you seeing him on Skype? It's Orange Lounge Radio.
10822080	10827080	I think I'm just going to say that to all the callers tonight. Just, you know, why not?
10827080	10831080	All right, 1-877-KMOLR. Your username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
10831080	10834080	While we wait for some calls, Loki, do we have any last minute stories tonight?
10834080	10840080	Snoop Dogg is having some rock band tracks coming to, well, rock band.
10840080	10841080	You don't say.
10841080	10847080	No, I don't say. No, it's on September 7th. I'm not sure what tracks are actually going to be in the-
10847080	10850080	It's not that fucking California girls song, is it?
10850080	10860080	It's going to be an eight-pack of tracks. It's going to include, and they don't say. So it's eight tracks, though.
10860080	10865080	How convenient. All right, let's go to the phones. We got more calls coming in.
10865080	10867080	But they were produced exclusively for rock band.
10867080	10871080	Hold on, we're getting hamburger calls. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
10871080	10877080	Hello? I think they hung up. Hi, Orange Lounge Radio. You there? Nope, it ended. They hung up.
10877080	10882080	Trigger finger, I don't know. Let's go to another call. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
10882080	10883080	Hey, this is X-Link.
10883080	10885080	Hi, X-Link. How are you, my friend?
10885080	10892080	Doing good. Doing well. Watching my fiancé over here playing on my iTouch, the Are You Smart in the 5th Grader.
10892080	10898080	Ah, that show. I can't believe they let Jeff Fox wear the host of Game Show.
10898080	10903080	But speaking of game shows, The Price is Right on Facebook is a complete crap.
10903080	10906080	Really? You are hitting, all right?
10906080	10908080	I'm hating it. Why are you hating it?
10908080	10911080	It's a completely watered-down version of the PC game.
10911080	10917080	If you spend 20 bucks by the PC game, just go through it and you can unlock every single one of these games and play as much as you want.
10917080	10922080	Don't sit there spending seven, eight hours trying to unlock every single one of these games, which you can do the same thing for 20 bucks,
10922080	10926080	maybe even a little less, and you can find it somewhere on sale or even on eBay or something.
10926080	10932080	But will the PC game allow me to post how I'm doing in the game so I can show off my EP into the world?
10932080	10935080	Why not just take a screenshot and do the same thing?
10935080	10943080	Will it let me possibly, if my team score is high enough, win a trip to L.A. to see a backstage taping or whatever it was called?
10943080	10945080	Why would you want to do that when you're already near L.A. as it is?
10945080	10947080	I'm not that close.
10947080	10951080	Hey, apparently I'm not able to fly there, as I learned this week.
10951080	10954080	Yeah, like burning down planes and everything.
10954080	10957080	I'm just that awesome, I guess. Burning down the house.
10957080	10960080	Yeah. You're hot. You're just burning down planes.
10960080	10963080	Hey, hey, hey. You can't make jokes like that.
10963080	10965080	Alright. Look, uh...
10965080	10968080	We can make jokes like that. They're just not in good taste.
10968080	10969080	Clearly.
10969080	10971080	I'm sorry. I'm sorry. That's going a little too far.
10971080	10975080	Anyways, a lot of these games are on Facebook.
10975080	10980080	I just don't like anymore because a lot of them, especially like the Price is Right, how it was in beta,
10980080	10984080	I didn't like that because of it being a watered-down version of the PC game.
10984080	10988080	Same thing with the iTouch versions of Price is Right.
10988080	10995080	And Price is Right were both also watered-down versions of the PC one.
10995080	10997080	Some of those iPod games are really horrible.
10997080	11001080	And I'll tell you, I finally was able to upgrade to the iPhone 4 this week.
11001080	11003080	I didn't talk about it earlier in the show because I had other video games to talk about.
11003080	11007080	But I finally, being the sheep I am, I upgraded to an iPhone 4.
11007080	11013080	One of the great things about it is that now it has the speed to actually be able to play a lot of the games that are out there for it.
11013080	11015080	But some of them aren't worth my time.
11015080	11019080	Like, there's a port of Sonic 2 available, which, you know, don't get me wrong.
11019080	11022080	I love Sonic and Sega makes some great games.
11022080	11025080	But the frame rate, even on the iPhone 4, is kind of junky.
11025080	11028080	And just controlling with the touchscreen is kind of crap.
11028080	11031080	Like, it just doesn't make for a good experience.
11031080	11036080	Not everything in the world has to be on the friggin' iPhone, you know?
11036080	11038080	No, I agree.
11038080	11041080	You know, I'm a big fan of a lot of different games.
11041080	11046080	And a lot of games, when they try to port it over, it was like turning into absolute, you know, crap.
11046080	11049080	It's like, what did they do with this? Why did they do this in the first place?
11049080	11052080	It's like, you don't think they took enough time with it, you know?
11052080	11055080	It's like, or at least enough feedback, I don't know.
11055080	11059080	Maybe because a lot of the feedback is being diluted by other companies, but, you know.
11059080	11062080	It's really interesting, though, just how saturated the marketplace has become.
11062080	11066080	They say it's almost impossible to make money in there now because it's just so, so saturated.
11066080	11071080	It takes so much for your game to stick out amongst everything that's out there
11071080	11073080	that a lot of people are really struggling.
11073080	11075080	I totally agree. I totally agree.
11075080	11079080	And, you know, I mean, nothing against any of these games.
11079080	11081080	You know, I love Price is Right and I love that kind of stuff.
11081080	11083080	And the only reason why I didn't blast it out at everybody on my Facebook page
11083080	11086080	is because I didn't really want everybody to be playing it.
11086080	11088080	I looked at it and I'm like, at first, it wasn't even loading.
11088080	11091080	It wasn't even loading at first. It was coming up as a blink train.
11091080	11095080	And when they did it, it was like, when I saw it, I'm like, no, I'm not doing this.
11095080	11100080	To be fair, to play Devil's Advocate just a little bit, the game is still in beta,
11100080	11103080	so it's not going to be perfect. I just got to throw that out there.
11103080	11109080	Yes, but I had 20, you know, I'd rather pay my $20 PC game that I bought.
11109080	11111080	So I was happy when I bought it day one.
11111080	11115080	I guess one point you do make, you know, you only get to play so many games
11115080	11118080	of The Price is Right for free, and then if you want more coins,
11118080	11120080	you have to buy them with real money.
11120080	11124080	So I totally get your point. Don't spend real money on this game
11124080	11127080	if you could just plop down $20 and get a superior game.
11127080	11128080	I'll agree with that.
11128080	11130080	Or even cheaper, depending on where you buy it from.
11130080	11133080	I mean, I've seen it even on sale as low as $10, depending on what place it's from.
11133080	11138080	So I mean, yes. Like I said before, it's worth the wait.
11138080	11140080	And the games are really good.
11140080	11142080	I mean, they did a real good job with Press Your Luck.
11142080	11144080	I love it for the PC. I play it all the time.
11144080	11146080	I love how there's 17 different episodes you can go through
11146080	11148080	and unlock different stuff.
11148080	11153080	But as for the other versions, other than maybe that and the Wii, it was crap.
11153080	11157080	It was like they just threw it out there without even knowing what was going on.
11157080	11161080	And I would love to see the PlayStation version have, like, avatar support.
11161080	11164080	But unfortunately, like I said before, the reason it didn't
11164080	11169080	is because of the fact that it was a bad replica of the port,
11169080	11172080	basically from that of the PC or the Wii.
11172080	11175080	All right. Well, I got to wrap up here.
11175080	11178080	Anything else you want to talk to our listeners about tonight real quick?
11178080	11180080	No, that's pretty much it. That's all I wanted to say.
11180080	11183080	That and the fact that Civ IV demo won't be coming out to the day of.
11183080	11186080	Civ V, but yes, it's not coming out to the day of.
11186080	11189080	I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I've been so behind you.
11189080	11192080	There's too many damn games to keep track of these days. It's all right.
11192080	11194080	Well, thank you for the call, my friend. Really appreciate it.
11194080	11197080	Have a wonderful week, and stay black.
11197080	11198080	You too. 5,000.
11198080	11199080	Bye.
11199080	11201080	What'd he say at the end there?
11201080	11202080	I missed that.
11202080	11205080	I missed it too. I hope it wasn't another plain joke,
11205080	11207080	because, yeah, they frown on those.
11207080	11209080	All right, that's it for the Skype line tonight.
11209080	11211080	Thank you guys so much for calling. We appreciate it.
11211080	11214080	Sorry if you didn't get through, but please, you can always send us an email, a tweet.
11214080	11217080	It's not too much to ask. 140 characters or less.
11217080	11220080	Loki, any stories you want to get out here before we finish?
11220080	11225080	Uh, yeah, I was just checking that right now to see if there was anything we didn't talk about.
11225080	11228080	You know what? Tigerclaw's throwing one out in chat I'll mention real quick.
11228080	11232080	I don't remember hearing this either unless Matt had just covered it before in the last one.
11232080	11235080	There's an Epic Mickey Collector's Edition. Did you mention that?
11235080	11237080	No, I didn't mention that, but whatever.
11237080	11242080	There is this Epic Mickey Collector's Edition, which you don't see a whole lot of Wii game collector's editions,
11242080	11246080	so that's kind of cool. But yeah, it looks like it's in an extra big box,
11246080	11249080	and it comes with a little, uh, it's $69.99.
11249080	11253080	It comes with a faceplate for the Wiimote, a DVD as well,
11253080	11258080	and it looks like a little five-inch vinyl figurine of Mickey with a paintbrush, which is kind of cool.
11258080	11262080	They had also a new collector's edition for Dead Rising 2,
11262080	11264080	where you can actually get it from Capcom,
11264080	11268080	and it comes with, like, a bunch of poker chips and custom poker cards and stuff like that,
11268080	11274080	and then also a chance to win a six-foot-tall life-size statue of, uh, Zombie.
11274080	11276080	But that's only, you know.
11276080	11281080	I thought at first, before I actually read the article, that it was every single package that was like,
11281080	11286080	oop, gonna buy that instantly, but, uh, obviously that would be way too expensive.
11286080	11289080	But, um, that's something that they're gonna be giving away.
11289080	11295080	Uh, let's see, stuff that maybe we didn't talk about.
11295080	11298080	Um...
11298080	11299080	Ah, yes.
11299080	11303080	Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep is not coming to the PlayStation Network,
11303080	11307080	so if you own a PSP Go, you ain't playing that game.
11307080	11309080	Thank you, Square Enix.
11309080	11311080	Um...
11311080	11314080	See, we talked a little bit about Angry Birds.
11314080	11319080	Um, I guess the devs working with Hollywood advisors on a possible movie pitch.
11319080	11322080	They will probably accept it because they're desperate for stuff.
11322080	11324080	Um...
11324080	11328080	The full track list for DJ Hero 2 got released.
11328080	11332080	Well, by track list, it means the songs that they will be using in the mixes.
11332080	11334080	Um, some cool stuff, though, I actually like.
11334080	11338080	It was funny, one of the songs I was actually almost gonna pick for a cage mechanism,
11338080	11343080	and still might pick, uh, the Prodigy Omen off their new album is on there.
11343080	11348080	And of course the, um, the classic Firestarter is part of that as well.
11348080	11351080	Um, some new Tiesto tracks on there.
11351080	11356080	Uh, Speedrail, I Will Be Here, and Come On.
11356080	11360080	Um, lots of Lady Gaga, actually.
11360080	11365080	They're gonna have Love Game, Bad Romance, and Just Dance in there as well.
11365080	11369080	Of course, Connie West's Love Lockdown and Heartless.
11369080	11374080	Um, and then they've got some random, like, old school stuff in there.
11374080	11377080	Like, they have, uh...
11377080	11379080	Is it Janet Jackson with Nasty?
11379080	11385080	Um, you know, they have Axl F is in there, the Axl Fully theme from the Beverly Hills Cop movies.
11385080	11389080	Um, Gorillaz, they've got Stylo in there.
11389080	11391080	Sweet!
11391080	11394080	Uh, Donna Summer's with, uh, Bad Girls.
11394080	11398080	Stylo has a pretty sweet bass line, though, I bet mixes really well with other songs.
11398080	11401080	Uh, New Order's Blue Monday is gonna be in there.
11401080	11403080	Uh, Orbital with the box.
11403080	11405080	That's pretty awesome, they have Orbital in there.
11405080	11407080	Uh, Salt-N-Pepa's Push It.
11407080	11409080	And then, um...
11409080	11415080	It's kinda cool, uh, Justice is gonna be in there as well with D.A.N.C.E. and also Waters of Nazareth.
11415080	11421080	I don't remember Waters of Nazareth, but I did put in D.A.N.C.E. in that cage match, so that's kinda cool.
11421080	11422080	But yeah, lots of cool stuff.
11422080	11425080	Uh, only one Daft Punk song, so that's a little depressing.
11425080	11427080	Human, after all, is in there.
11427080	11430080	Um, Basement Jacks with Where's Your Head At.
11430080	11432080	Um, yeah, lots of cool stuff.
11432080	11434080	Very excited about it.
11434080	11439080	In fact, actually, they have a Facebook app that you can check out that's a contest where you're supposed to guess what the mashups are.
11439080	11445080	And they're kinda giving you a little bit of a preview of, um, some of the songs that are actually gonna be in the game of sets and stuff.
11445080	11447080	So, it's kinda neat, so check that out.
11447080	11452080	Alright. I wonder if there's any standalone songs, cause there were a few of those in, uh, D0-1, like Herbie Hancock.
11452080	11457080	There might be some beat juggles or whatever, um, so, that could be cool.
11457080	11460080	Um, I don't know.
11460080	11462080	Uh, we'll see.
11462080	11463080	Yeah.
11463080	11469080	Alright, well if that's it for, uh, Last Minute Stories, then, um, I guess it's time to go around and get everybody's final thought.
11469080	11471080	It's time to end another show.
11471080	11472080	Boohoo, sad.
11472080	11474080	Um, final thoughts tonight.
11474080	11476080	Darsakra, what's your final thought tonight?
11476080	11477080	My arms hurt.
11477080	11478080	I'm sorry to hear that.
11478080	11480080	Loki, you have a final thought tonight?
11480080	11487080	Uh, one last thing I was gonna say, uh, Portal is also gonna become part of the syllabus at apparently Wabush College.
11487080	11491080	It's actually, you know, I don't think you have to read it, but obviously play it.
11491080	11493080	Cause they're a heck of a final thought.
11493080	11500080	Yeah, but, uh, no, my final thought is, uh, I have a headache from lack of sleep, and I don't anticipate it going away.
11500080	11502080	And that sucks.
11502080	11507080	My final thought is, back to work tomorrow, back to the real world, boohoo, cry, sob.
11507080	11510080	But hey, three day weekend coming up, yay! Labor Day!
11510080	11512080	Yay!
11512080	11514080	That's right, that's, uh, next weekend.
11514080	11516080	That's right, it's coming weekend.
11516080	11518080	Ah, that's why we're doing the, it all makes sense now.
11518080	11521080	There you go! Hello!
11521080	11523080	Uh, you know what that means, though?
11523080	11528080	That means I have to wake up earlier with the baby, because Nellie's gonna be like, I wanna sleep in!
11528080	11530080	Which is fine, you know, I let her.
11530080	11539080	I pamper this woman, like, seriously, I get like four hours of sleep, and I give her a foot massage.
11539080	11544080	You know, I don't even go to sleep, I give her a foot massage, and then I go to sleep.
11544080	11545080	Wow.
11545080	11547080	Yeah, yeah, good husband here!
11547080	11548080	You're a great husband.
11548080	11555080	Alright, uh, keep your eye out on the forums, guys, we're gonna be taking suggestions for the marathon, um, within reason, keep it clean.
11555080	11560080	Uh, and, uh, all that good stuff, um, Loki, of course, will be joining us next week for the real show, quote, quote.
11560080	11567080	Uh, and then, uh, myself, DarkSakura, Alan will be here for the marathon, um, hopefully Dan, and who knows who else are gonna show up.
11567080	11571080	You gotta invite Mystique, I hope she shows up, because she can yell random things in the microphone.
11571080	11573080	What other local folks can we be inviting to the show?
11573080	11575080	Maybe a few peeps.
11575080	11577080	Alright, it'll be surprise-filled.
11577080	11580080	So, we'll be back next week with an epic, epicness show.
