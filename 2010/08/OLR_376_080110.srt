00:00:14,155 --> 00:00:25,595
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, August 1st, 2010, a big MMO plans a free-to-play model, Valve accidentally bans 12,000 players, and the creator of Ultima wins $28 million from his former company.

2
00:00:31,584 --> 00:00:36,326
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:36,386 --> 00:00:41,909
[SPEAKER_01]: We are that program dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle.

4
00:00:41,949 --> 00:00:44,590
[SPEAKER_01]: We are that show where every gamer has a voice.

5
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:45,850
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Rob Roberts.

6
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:48,452
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be joining you over the next few hours here at All Games Radio.

7
00:00:49,432 --> 00:00:50,153
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, Jamie Summers

8
00:01:07,928 --> 00:01:10,990
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know you were dining on meat this week.

9
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:16,573
[SPEAKER_02]: Every so often I dine on the meat, but I do not necessarily chow on the cow, and I definitely don't dine on the swine.

10
00:01:16,693 --> 00:01:18,455
[SPEAKER_01]: Chow on the cow and dine on the swine, alright.

11
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:20,756
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember I got that from Danielle back in the day.

12
00:01:21,368 --> 00:01:24,171
[SPEAKER_01]: Loki is not here tonight

13
00:01:39,847 --> 00:01:44,068
[SPEAKER_01]: Loki's not here because this is the day that we knew was going to be coming for some time.

14
00:01:44,268 --> 00:01:49,589
[SPEAKER_01]: Loki's going to be out for a few shows because Miss Loki went into labor this morning at 11 a.m.

15
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:50,630
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all we know.

16
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:52,110
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have a lot of updates other than that.

17
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:56,251
[SPEAKER_01]: The baby is not here, or at least the arrival has not been announced on Facebook.

18
00:01:56,511 --> 00:01:59,732
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I were Loki, I would not be running to Facebook to announce the birth first thing.

19
00:02:00,416 --> 00:02:08,000
[SPEAKER_02]: My guess is that they do have a tiny one right now who is currently doing a lot of sleeping as is mommy.

20
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:17,545
[SPEAKER_02]: So during sleep time we should start seeing the messages because the body goes through quite a lot of hell in childbirth.

21
00:02:20,063 --> 00:02:21,425
[SPEAKER_02]: Being born is hard work.

22
00:02:23,326 --> 00:02:25,007
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot of pushing.

23
00:02:25,027 --> 00:02:27,690
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do have some guests here.

24
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:33,134
[SPEAKER_01]: Because this all happened this morning, we weren't really prepared to have another co-host come in.

25
00:02:33,174 --> 00:02:34,735
[SPEAKER_01]: We are going to have something a little more permanent.

26
00:02:35,376 --> 00:02:38,078
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, not permanent because obviously Loki's not being replaced.

27
00:02:38,118 --> 00:02:38,979
[SPEAKER_01]: God know he'll come back.

28
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:45,344
[SPEAKER_01]: But for about the next month or so while Loki's off being a daddy, we'll have a more long-term co-host next week.

29
00:02:45,924 --> 00:02:47,185
[SPEAKER_01]: But for now, we have some special guests.

30
00:02:47,205 --> 00:02:47,786
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a co-host, Rob.

31
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:48,506
[SPEAKER_01]: What's that?

32
00:02:48,526 --> 00:02:51,208
[SPEAKER_01]: Where is it?

33
00:02:51,228 --> 00:02:52,208
[SPEAKER_01]: Aha, your co-host fails.

34
00:02:52,328 --> 00:02:52,608
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

35
00:02:52,948 --> 00:02:54,369
[SPEAKER_02]: My co-host is turned from me.

36
00:02:57,571 --> 00:02:59,352
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, the batteries are dying on the Dalek.

37
00:02:59,412 --> 00:03:00,292
[SPEAKER_01]: That ought to tell you something.

38
00:03:00,332 --> 00:03:01,193
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's not dying.

39
00:03:01,633 --> 00:03:02,813
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs to exterminate itself.

40
00:03:03,414 --> 00:03:05,135
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have some guests here in studio tonight.

41
00:03:05,195 --> 00:03:06,395
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say hello first, too.

42
00:03:06,655 --> 00:03:10,377
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've met both of these guests for the first and second time tonight.

43
00:03:10,437 --> 00:03:13,959
[SPEAKER_01]: So I apologize if I'm mispronouncing you, but you're Mila?

44
00:03:14,019 --> 00:03:14,199
[SPEAKER_01]: Myla.

45
00:03:14,219 --> 00:03:14,379
[SPEAKER_01]: Myla.

46
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,520
[SPEAKER_01]: Myla Minoki.

47
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:17,541
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you, Myla Minoki?

48
00:03:17,561 --> 00:03:17,601
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.

49
00:03:20,222 --> 00:03:24,244
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm glad to be a guest on the show.

50
00:03:24,444 --> 00:03:24,964
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't wait.

51
00:03:25,004 --> 00:03:27,885
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not hearing you at all and I'm trying to figure out why.

52
00:03:28,065 --> 00:03:28,685
[SPEAKER_02]: Turn my mic.

53
00:03:29,346 --> 00:03:31,206
[SPEAKER_02]: See Rob, you were afraid that my mic was going to be crappy.

54
00:03:31,286 --> 00:03:32,007
[SPEAKER_01]: What is going on?

55
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:33,247
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the switch on?

56
00:03:33,287 --> 00:03:34,328
[SPEAKER_01]: That's always a common mistake.

57
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:36,468
[SPEAKER_01]: Now much better.

58
00:03:37,609 --> 00:03:39,650
[SPEAKER_01]: First rule of radio, turn your mic on.

59
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:42,471
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's try this from the top.

60
00:03:42,551 --> 00:03:42,831
[SPEAKER_01]: Myla!

61
00:03:43,311 --> 00:03:43,892
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi there!

62
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:44,272
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you?

63
00:03:44,633 --> 00:03:45,554
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing fantastic.

64
00:03:46,795 --> 00:03:53,403
[SPEAKER_04]: I was actually turned on to the show by our wonderful intern, Drunami, and I guess I'm the sub-intern?

65
00:03:53,603 --> 00:03:55,085
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess I count as the sub-intern?

66
00:03:55,105 --> 00:03:56,266
[SPEAKER_01]: You're the intern's intern.

67
00:03:56,707 --> 00:03:57,748
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm the intern's gopher.

68
00:03:57,968 --> 00:03:58,769
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm the gopher.

69
00:03:58,910 --> 00:03:59,450
[SPEAKER_04]: You're the gopher.

70
00:03:59,470 --> 00:03:59,711
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn it!

71
00:04:00,911 --> 00:04:04,794
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a lot in common gaming-wise with intern Drew, right?

72
00:04:04,854 --> 00:04:05,574
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

73
00:04:05,734 --> 00:04:08,235
[SPEAKER_01]: You described yourself to me as a budget gamer.

74
00:04:08,255 --> 00:04:09,356
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the type of video games you're into?

75
00:04:09,376 --> 00:04:09,596
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

76
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:14,519
[SPEAKER_04]: If it costs less than $10, I've usually either played it or bought it.

77
00:04:15,539 --> 00:04:20,782
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm usually very much on the budget gaming, so much so that my MMO of choice is RuneScape.

78
00:04:20,902 --> 00:04:21,182
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

79
00:04:21,202 --> 00:04:21,963
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's free.

80
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:23,551
[SPEAKER_01]: Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary

81
00:04:40,273 --> 00:04:40,954
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, that's me.

82
00:04:41,074 --> 00:04:41,634
[SPEAKER_01]: How you doing, Gary?

83
00:04:42,395 --> 00:04:42,855
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm alright.

84
00:04:43,576 --> 00:04:44,056
[SPEAKER_01]: Glad to be here.

85
00:04:44,276 --> 00:04:44,516
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

86
00:04:44,877 --> 00:04:45,737
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a friend of Punk Night.

87
00:04:46,298 --> 00:04:46,578
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?

88
00:04:47,359 --> 00:04:50,961
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody is so randomly connected to OLR somehow.

89
00:04:50,981 --> 00:04:51,662
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got to figure this out.

90
00:04:51,682 --> 00:04:55,005
[SPEAKER_06]: You might know me as Mindstorm or SMF2045 online.

91
00:04:55,265 --> 00:04:55,445
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

92
00:04:55,465 --> 00:04:56,025
[SPEAKER_06]: Either one of those.

93
00:04:56,426 --> 00:04:56,746
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.

94
00:04:56,766 --> 00:04:57,907
[SPEAKER_06]: That'd be SMF.

95
00:04:58,427 --> 00:04:58,948
[SPEAKER_06]: Getting back.

96
00:04:59,088 --> 00:04:59,848
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, whatever.

97
00:05:00,969 --> 00:05:01,730
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an acronym.

98
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:02,911
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll explain later.

99
00:05:02,931 --> 00:05:03,051
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

100
00:05:03,751 --> 00:05:06,093
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

101
00:05:23,446 --> 00:05:24,327
[SPEAKER_01]: Not entirely true.

102
00:05:24,707 --> 00:05:25,267
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, okay.

103
00:05:25,668 --> 00:05:29,230
[SPEAKER_01]: I got the impression you're more of a games that involve more than six sides on my dice.

104
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:36,756
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I'm a tabletop gamer, but thanks to DarkSakura, I picked up SimCity 3, and when I get a chance to play it, I love it.

105
00:05:36,776 --> 00:05:37,356
[SPEAKER_06]: SimCity?

106
00:05:37,476 --> 00:05:38,597
[SPEAKER_06]: Sims 3.

107
00:05:38,737 --> 00:05:39,057
[SPEAKER_06]: Sims 3.

108
00:05:39,698 --> 00:05:40,258
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

109
00:05:40,498 --> 00:05:41,979
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a SimCity 3, I believe.

110
00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:42,540
[SPEAKER_01]: No, SimCity 3000.

111
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,681
[SPEAKER_02]: No, wait till I get you Modnum.

112
00:05:46,222 --> 00:05:48,124
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I left off SimCity a long time ago.

113
00:05:48,284 --> 00:05:49,605
[SPEAKER_02]: I just downloaded Boob Sliders.

114
00:05:50,947 --> 00:05:52,429
[SPEAKER_01]: This isn't the first time I've met Gary.

115
00:05:53,251 --> 00:05:55,736
[SPEAKER_01]: The first time I met Gary was at Jamie's rock band party.

116
00:05:55,896 --> 00:05:56,878
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yes, rock band.

117
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:58,021
[SPEAKER_06]: The beer potluck.

118
00:05:58,902 --> 00:06:00,465
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yes, that was technically the beer potluck.

119
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:01,487
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember the beer potluck.

120
00:06:01,507 --> 00:06:01,928
[SPEAKER_06]: When was that?

121
00:06:02,822 --> 00:06:05,583
[SPEAKER_01]: Your mic is dying.

122
00:06:06,064 --> 00:06:09,406
[SPEAKER_01]: Ouch, my ears.

123
00:06:10,126 --> 00:06:13,908
[SPEAKER_02]: I told everyone to bring beer so we could have a beer potluck.

124
00:06:15,128 --> 00:06:16,749
[SPEAKER_02]: Gary brought meat, which was almost as good.

125
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:20,912
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because I don't drink.

126
00:06:21,932 --> 00:06:24,493
[SPEAKER_02]: I still have one Guinness left from that time, Rob.

127
00:06:24,954 --> 00:06:25,394
[SPEAKER_02]: One Guinness.

128
00:06:26,034 --> 00:06:27,995
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to drink the fuck out of that Guinness.

129
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:31,137
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll be able to skip a meal when you do because Guinness is liquid bread.

130
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:32,592
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yummy.

131
00:06:33,033 --> 00:06:37,581
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's going to be my celebration for being off Vicodin because my hand is fucked up even more now.

132
00:06:38,322 --> 00:06:39,785
[SPEAKER_04]: And by the way, thanks for the peach beer.

133
00:06:39,805 --> 00:06:40,366
[SPEAKER_04]: It was delicious.

134
00:06:40,805 --> 00:06:44,347
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I couldn't, you remember I couldn't drink the peach Lombek?

135
00:06:44,527 --> 00:06:44,887
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.

136
00:06:45,248 --> 00:06:46,428
[SPEAKER_02]: I gave it to her.

137
00:06:46,508 --> 00:06:46,688
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

138
00:06:46,889 --> 00:06:47,369
[SPEAKER_04]: It was wonderful.

139
00:06:47,469 --> 00:06:48,349
[SPEAKER_04]: I loved it.

140
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:50,251
[SPEAKER_02]: So now for the story.

141
00:06:50,751 --> 00:06:51,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay.

142
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:51,932
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, story time?

143
00:06:52,272 --> 00:06:52,532
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

144
00:06:52,552 --> 00:06:53,673
[SPEAKER_02]: This is how we met.

145
00:06:54,033 --> 00:06:55,133
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, Myla.

146
00:06:55,494 --> 00:06:56,354
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

147
00:06:56,394 --> 00:06:57,855
[SPEAKER_02]: We skip names all the time.

148
00:06:57,895 --> 00:07:03,839
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, Gary tells me that on our way to Shul downtown that we're picking up somebody.

149
00:07:04,819 --> 00:07:07,921
[SPEAKER_02]: So I instantly am pounce-hugged by this person.

150
00:07:08,382 --> 00:07:10,684
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, okay, hi, you're fun.

151
00:07:11,244 --> 00:07:12,145
[SPEAKER_02]: I instantly like you.

152
00:07:12,825 --> 00:07:17,469
[SPEAKER_02]: And then she was talking about playing DDR, and I said, oh yeah, I used to moderate on DDR Freak.

153
00:07:17,609 --> 00:07:18,349
[SPEAKER_02]: It was DarkSakura.

154
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,531
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's like, from Orange Lounge?

155
00:07:21,952 --> 00:07:22,913
[SPEAKER_02]: You know Drew!

156
00:07:23,433 --> 00:07:23,993
[SPEAKER_01]: How funny.

157
00:07:24,454 --> 00:07:25,515
[SPEAKER_01]: Small world, ain't it?

158
00:07:25,535 --> 00:07:26,015
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, small world.

159
00:07:26,075 --> 00:07:29,818
[SPEAKER_02]: So we both called him and left him what-the-fuck voice messages.

160
00:07:29,878 --> 00:07:30,618
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait a minute, wait a minute.

161
00:07:30,738 --> 00:07:32,660
[SPEAKER_01]: Is tonight on OLR like Jew party?

162
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,981
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that what this is tonight?

163
00:07:34,201 --> 00:07:34,961
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the matter?

164
00:07:34,981 --> 00:07:35,882
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't count.

165
00:07:36,502 --> 00:07:38,604
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I thought you... I'm not yet.

166
00:07:38,704 --> 00:07:39,965
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

167
00:07:40,245 --> 00:07:41,706
[SPEAKER_06]: The people in this room are only half Jewish.

168
00:07:41,746 --> 00:07:43,968
[SPEAKER_06]: There's only half Jewish.

169
00:07:44,068 --> 00:07:44,969
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Jewish by proxy.

170
00:07:45,249 --> 00:07:45,549
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

171
00:07:46,269 --> 00:07:46,530
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

172
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:50,453
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have Jew, Jew by proxy, Jew in training, and not Jew.

173
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:51,133
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

174
00:07:52,074 --> 00:07:52,434
Just kidding.

175
00:07:53,134 --> 00:07:53,495
[SPEAKER_02]: And gay.

176
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:57,557
[SPEAKER_06]: The short word for not Jew is goy.

177
00:07:57,617 --> 00:08:04,101
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the world of oppressed peoples.

178
00:08:04,641 --> 00:08:06,523
[SPEAKER_01]: But I love the Jewish people.

179
00:08:06,603 --> 00:08:10,065
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say I'm not a fag hag, but I'm a Jew hag.

180
00:08:10,105 --> 00:08:11,486
[SPEAKER_01]: You're a Jew hag.

181
00:08:11,986 --> 00:08:13,727
[SPEAKER_01]: What would you call it?

182
00:08:14,067 --> 00:08:15,928
[SPEAKER_01]: Like somebody who likes to hang out?

183
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:17,029
[SPEAKER_01]: You're a goy toy.

184
00:08:17,089 --> 00:08:17,630
[SPEAKER_01]: A goy toy.

185
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:18,190
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.

186
00:08:20,972 --> 00:08:21,292
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

187
00:08:22,673 --> 00:08:23,274
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't mind us.

188
00:08:23,354 --> 00:08:24,815
[SPEAKER_04]: We're geeks, we're gamers, and we're fun.

189
00:08:25,135 --> 00:08:26,616
[SPEAKER_01]: And very silly.

190
00:08:26,856 --> 00:08:31,780
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, guys, this is one of those weeks where I don't know why we're doing a show tonight.

191
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:32,481
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly.

192
00:08:33,302 --> 00:08:34,543
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not?

193
00:08:34,603 --> 00:08:36,124
[SPEAKER_01]: We need this, Rob.

194
00:08:36,164 --> 00:08:37,585
[SPEAKER_01]: For some reason, guys, like...

195
00:08:37,865 --> 00:08:42,649
[SPEAKER_01]: We decided to do the trial Facebook ad campaign this week, which I'll talk about in a minute.

196
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:46,412
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a big deal, but we're trying to get word out there more about the show.

197
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:50,016
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we probably have some brand new people listening for the first time tonight.

198
00:08:50,036 --> 00:08:50,576
[SPEAKER_01]: We're sorry.

199
00:08:50,836 --> 00:08:53,198
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm thinking to myself... Apologies in advance.

200
00:08:53,238 --> 00:08:55,921
[SPEAKER_01]: Please go back in the archives and listen.

201
00:08:55,961 --> 00:08:57,702
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, 374 was a good show.

202
00:08:58,203 --> 00:09:01,125
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad that you have these numbers memorized, because I sure as hell don't.

203
00:09:01,225 --> 00:09:02,987
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, how do you know it's not going to be a good show tonight?

204
00:09:03,908 --> 00:09:04,568
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it'll be fine.

205
00:09:04,608 --> 00:09:05,309
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to have fun.

206
00:09:06,089 --> 00:09:07,090
[SPEAKER_02]: and that being really fun.

207
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:10,233
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially when we're completely just thrown off our patterns.

208
00:09:10,313 --> 00:09:11,814
[SPEAKER_02]: The random is hilarious.

209
00:09:11,874 --> 00:09:17,339
[SPEAKER_01]: I think all of us tonight kind of collectively, well I can't speak for the guests, but I know Jamie and I just kind of don't give a fuck tonight.

210
00:09:17,359 --> 00:09:17,979
[SPEAKER_01]: At least I don't.

211
00:09:18,888 --> 00:09:20,729
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys have me on the show, so I know you don't give a fuck.

212
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:23,772
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys have me on the show, so it's proof you don't give a fuck.

213
00:09:23,892 --> 00:09:26,214
[SPEAKER_02]: I gave a fuck, but I don't remember who I gave it to.

214
00:09:26,234 --> 00:09:27,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably Dan.

215
00:09:27,655 --> 00:09:28,535
[SPEAKER_02]: That's dangerous.

216
00:09:29,596 --> 00:09:35,040
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, there was... We should probably get into the how was our week and day and shit, because there was some stuff.

217
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:41,705
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, technically it's how was your gaming week is how we start off, but I know you're dying to talk about why you're off.

218
00:09:41,945 --> 00:09:43,226
[SPEAKER_01]: I really don't have an excuse.

219
00:09:43,487 --> 00:09:44,968
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just... I'm on the rag.

220
00:09:45,368 --> 00:09:46,529
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm on man rag tonight.

221
00:09:46,569 --> 00:09:47,650
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what you'd call that.

222
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:50,031
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need that.

223
00:09:50,091 --> 00:09:50,912
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for damn sure.

224
00:09:51,332 --> 00:09:52,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Need some freshening, Rob?

225
00:09:52,373 --> 00:09:53,354
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you feel not so fresh?

226
00:09:53,374 --> 00:09:54,074
[SPEAKER_02]: We could get you a douche.

227
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:56,616
[SPEAKER_01]: You know how... You're a douche.

228
00:09:57,777 --> 00:09:59,057
[SPEAKER_02]: Your face is a douche.

229
00:09:59,077 --> 00:10:03,340
[SPEAKER_02]: You know how... I'll friend your butt.

230
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:05,502
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you know what I'm talking about.

231
00:10:05,722 --> 00:10:07,303
[SPEAKER_01]: Seventh grade flashbacks.

232
00:10:07,343 --> 00:10:12,927
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody will just tell you good morning and you'll want to be like, Why are you looking at me like that?

233
00:10:13,187 --> 00:10:13,387
Okay.

234
00:10:13,747 --> 00:10:17,130
[SPEAKER_01]: Although that makes it sound like it's about my relationship, which it really is not.

235
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,392
[SPEAKER_01]: My relationship is awesome.

236
00:10:18,792 --> 00:10:20,614
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Alan is the best thing ever.

237
00:10:20,834 --> 00:10:22,215
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Alan is the best thing ever.

238
00:10:22,235 --> 00:10:22,916
[SPEAKER_01]: It's everything else.

239
00:10:23,276 --> 00:10:24,197
[SPEAKER_02]: I want him to be my gay boyfriend.

240
00:10:24,217 --> 00:10:24,677
[SPEAKER_01]: He's bugging me.

241
00:10:25,979 --> 00:10:26,799
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't have him.

242
00:10:26,819 --> 00:10:27,300
[SPEAKER_01]: He's mine.

243
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:30,463
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, well anyhow.

244
00:10:30,998 --> 00:10:32,339
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

245
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:52,881
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't know any of those.

246
00:10:53,741 --> 00:10:55,382
[SPEAKER_06]: As I'm eating chips during the show.

247
00:10:55,402 --> 00:10:56,463
[SPEAKER_02]: S-T-F-U.

248
00:10:56,983 --> 00:10:58,304
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, you're eating something kind of healthy.

249
00:10:59,265 --> 00:10:59,605
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of.

250
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:01,426
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a banana for breakfast.

251
00:11:01,546 --> 00:11:01,767
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

252
00:11:03,107 --> 00:11:03,788
[SPEAKER_02]: My husband, Dan...

253
00:11:05,894 --> 00:11:11,640
[SPEAKER_02]: Age 34, went into the hospital Tuesday morning at a quarter after 3 for congestive heart failure.

254
00:11:12,681 --> 00:11:13,922
[SPEAKER_02]: My husband is 34 years old.

255
00:11:14,703 --> 00:11:16,024
[SPEAKER_02]: This is something that you could die from.

256
00:11:17,346 --> 00:11:20,268
[SPEAKER_02]: Or suffer massive damage to your other organs.

257
00:11:20,629 --> 00:11:21,910
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, he was coughing up blood.

258
00:11:22,411 --> 00:11:22,691
[SPEAKER_04]: Yikes.

259
00:11:23,091 --> 00:11:24,953
[SPEAKER_02]: And feeling really short of breath.

260
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:27,275
[SPEAKER_02]: He didn't have any of the pain or numbness.

261
00:11:27,796 --> 00:11:29,438
[SPEAKER_02]: So, thankfully, his heart was in good shape.

262
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:34,061
[SPEAKER_02]: He went in early Tuesday morning and got to leave Friday afternoon.

263
00:11:34,641 --> 00:11:36,722
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, more like Friday evening.

264
00:11:37,203 --> 00:11:38,704
[SPEAKER_02]: His blood pressure was super high.

265
00:11:38,824 --> 00:11:52,252
[SPEAKER_02]: Thankfully, after numerous ultrasounds and x-rays and what give you rays and tests and things and prodding, lots of prodding, they determined that all the rest of him worked just fine.

266
00:11:53,353 --> 00:11:55,955
[SPEAKER_02]: He didn't damage his organs and he could come home.

267
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:59,177
[SPEAKER_02]: He's on blood pressure medication now, quite a bit of it.

268
00:11:59,837 --> 00:12:01,280
[SPEAKER_02]: www.DarkSakura.com

269
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:18,623
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've got someone in the room who's been through the similar.

270
00:12:37,003 --> 00:12:38,544
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

271
00:12:54,355 --> 00:12:54,435
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike,

272
00:13:18,843 --> 00:13:19,764
[SPEAKER_02]: I am talking on my mic.

273
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:21,205
[SPEAKER_01]: It's... LA!

274
00:13:21,445 --> 00:13:24,068
[SPEAKER_01]: Your connection at the base is... Okay, I'm holding it in.

275
00:13:24,088 --> 00:13:24,788
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm holding it in.

276
00:13:24,808 --> 00:13:25,429
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I can hear you.

277
00:13:25,829 --> 00:13:26,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

278
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:27,010
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, of course you can hear me.

279
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:28,171
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean through your mic.

280
00:13:28,852 --> 00:13:34,317
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, let this be a warning to everybody that, you know, don't think this can't happen to me.

281
00:13:34,617 --> 00:13:43,024
[SPEAKER_02]: You really... And I know, again, it's like with Dan's situation, he wasn't ready to change until he got slapped in the face with it.

282
00:13:43,064 --> 00:13:43,325
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

283
00:13:44,045 --> 00:13:44,686
[SPEAKER_02]: Ignition Pads 3 of them

284
00:14:12,404 --> 00:14:16,767
[SPEAKER_02]: for $6 at the thrift store.

285
00:14:16,827 --> 00:14:18,509
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if they work, but they were in good shape.

286
00:14:18,609 --> 00:14:22,452
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to clean the crap out of them, and I'm going to make Dan play some Boom Boom Dollar with me.

287
00:14:22,812 --> 00:14:24,253
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay!

288
00:14:24,873 --> 00:14:25,654
[SPEAKER_06]: That sounds awesome.

289
00:14:25,674 --> 00:14:30,498
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's what my week's been, so really, as far as going into gaming, I ain't played shit.

290
00:14:31,578 --> 00:14:34,039
[SPEAKER_02]: Except for Ragnarok Online, which I'm playing again.

291
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:41,183
[SPEAKER_02]: And really, I played that because it was so mindless that I could just play and not have to think.

292
00:14:41,943 --> 00:14:43,304
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I wasn't able to sleep.

293
00:14:43,464 --> 00:14:54,169
[SPEAKER_02]: I went that first day on an hour and a half of sleep and did not go to bed until something like... I took a little nap, which is my hour and a half of sleep, and then I was up until like three in the morning.

294
00:14:54,537 --> 00:14:55,538
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I can't say I blame you.

295
00:14:55,698 --> 00:15:08,128
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was up again at 9 the next day, and I just, it's been, I slept really funny, and I've spent, I've never been so freaked out in my life, even though I knew he was in good hands, you know.

296
00:15:09,829 --> 00:15:14,753
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the other thing, too, and, you know, I know I'm probably going into a bit of personal detail, but I don't care.

297
00:15:15,294 --> 00:15:16,795
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a microphone, and I'm going to use it.

298
00:15:16,975 --> 00:15:19,437
[SPEAKER_01]: Tonight's the feel-good episode of OLR, everybody.

299
00:15:19,457 --> 00:15:23,961
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't make me bust out the booze, Hila.

300
00:15:26,698 --> 00:15:35,643
[SPEAKER_02]: At any rate, the way things were going, you know, Dan and I were talking about, you know, we've been talking about having a kid, me and Dan.

301
00:15:35,723 --> 00:15:39,486
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I've been forthcoming on this on the show because I'm going to totally get Matt to do our nursery.

302
00:15:39,906 --> 00:15:41,087
[SPEAKER_04]: Aw, mini Sakura, yay!

303
00:15:42,379 --> 00:15:46,840
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this a tangent where I can mention that Matt's nursery was actually on Game Informer?

304
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,800
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it?

305
00:15:48,561 --> 00:15:50,441
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that a big blog or magazine?

306
00:15:50,501 --> 00:15:51,241
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to be honest.

307
00:15:51,481 --> 00:15:54,082
[SPEAKER_02]: Game Informer is the one that's sponsored by... Are they the GameStop one?

308
00:15:54,202 --> 00:15:54,382
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

309
00:15:54,582 --> 00:15:56,883
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, his nursery was on that.

310
00:15:57,363 --> 00:15:59,223
[SPEAKER_01]: But it had nothing to do with OLR.

311
00:15:59,343 --> 00:16:01,624
[SPEAKER_01]: They found his pictures on Flickr.

312
00:16:02,304 --> 00:16:02,584
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura.com

313
00:16:28,665 --> 00:16:32,990
[SPEAKER_02]: However, you can copyright the photos and then they have to pay you.

314
00:16:34,932 --> 00:16:35,973
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case, it's good news.

315
00:16:36,033 --> 00:16:38,515
[SPEAKER_01]: But you just got to be careful what you put up on the internet.

316
00:16:38,615 --> 00:16:41,959
[SPEAKER_01]: If it hadn't been good news, you want to be careful.

317
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:44,882
[SPEAKER_06]: Just be careful what you say on your Facebook accounts.

318
00:16:44,922 --> 00:16:49,326
[SPEAKER_06]: People have gotten fired from jobs because they said something their bosses didn't like.

319
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:53,529
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why mine is fully blocked and I really don't allow photo tagging.

320
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:57,092
[SPEAKER_02]: If someone's tagged my stuff, I go look it up and only let the stuff I tag myself.

321
00:16:57,132 --> 00:17:00,715
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate that Facebook does not let you approve what you get tagged in.

322
00:17:00,815 --> 00:17:03,177
[SPEAKER_02]: But nobody can see my stuff.

323
00:17:04,057 --> 00:17:05,358
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody who's not a friend of yours.

324
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:06,339
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

325
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,321
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't allow friend-to-friend viewing.

326
00:17:09,301 --> 00:17:09,742
[SPEAKER_06]: Understood.

327
00:17:11,143 --> 00:17:11,643
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, Jamie.

328
00:17:11,683 --> 00:17:12,844
[SPEAKER_01]: Back to your traumatic week.

329
00:17:12,924 --> 00:17:13,324
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

330
00:17:14,369 --> 00:17:15,269
[SPEAKER_02]: So please, share with us.

331
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:23,534
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, well, you know, Dan and I were talking about having a kid, and I totally don't want to really do it until I'm sure he's going to stick with this.

332
00:17:24,054 --> 00:17:39,802
[SPEAKER_02]: As much as I would like one, I want to make sure that, you know, and we were actually, the ironic thing is that we were talking about that Tuesday, Monday during the day, is, you know, how, and I wasn't so much worried about him dying, I was worried about him not being able to keep up with the kid, you know, because Dan's a big guy.

333
00:17:40,782 --> 00:17:43,644
[SPEAKER_02]: And now I'm actually worried about maybe, you know, him dying.

334
00:17:44,284 --> 00:17:48,186
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm, you know, I'll say right now, I'm 34 years old.

335
00:17:48,806 --> 00:17:51,848
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Dan and I are coming up on our 5th anniversary on September 1st.

336
00:17:52,308 --> 00:17:54,809
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been together for almost 14 years as of January.

337
00:17:55,810 --> 00:18:00,752
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I never thought for an instant I was ever going to have to be without him.

338
00:18:01,312 --> 00:18:02,073
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was...

339
00:18:02,853 --> 00:18:03,574
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

340
00:18:25,832 --> 00:18:36,222
[SPEAKER_02]: People out there, if you have a significant other or someone in your family that is at risk, you need to sit down and have the talk with them because when they think it can't happen, it does.

341
00:18:38,036 --> 00:19:01,021
[SPEAKER_01]: and so you know even though we're being one of those game podcasts yet another one that doesn't actually seem to talk about games for 30 minutes this is important because you know if you are you know sitting there and you're you're down in Doritos and maybe you're a little bit fluffy you know I love that word fluffy chances are me too I think it's a Gabriel Iglesias I think you know and it happens to all of us I'm feeling a little fluffy right now in fact

342
00:19:01,741 --> 00:19:04,522
[SPEAKER_06]: My grandma's got a refrigerator magnet that says I'm not fat, I'm fluffy.

343
00:19:04,743 --> 00:19:05,503
[SPEAKER_06]: My boobs are fluffy.

344
00:19:05,803 --> 00:19:09,265
[SPEAKER_06]: It's something to watch out for if you spend lots of time sitting.

345
00:19:09,285 --> 00:19:12,726
[SPEAKER_06]: I used to work in an office and play games, didn't get much exercise.

346
00:19:13,246 --> 00:19:14,987
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a wake-up call earlier this year.

347
00:19:15,047 --> 00:19:15,747
[SPEAKER_01]: God bless the Wii.

348
00:19:16,127 --> 00:19:18,528
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if you're not well, I don't know about that.

349
00:19:18,568 --> 00:19:19,469
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if I'd go that far.

350
00:19:19,969 --> 00:19:22,010
[SPEAKER_02]: I still want to borrow your Wii Fit.

351
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:26,833
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if you're not fluffy, take time to evaluate.

352
00:19:27,754 --> 00:19:30,255
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I going outside enough?

353
00:19:30,436 --> 00:19:32,417
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I walking?

354
00:19:32,677 --> 00:19:37,420
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I maybe eating not so good as I could be?

355
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:40,442
[SPEAKER_06]: The straight Cheetos diet is not necessarily good for you.

356
00:19:40,482 --> 00:19:43,124
[SPEAKER_02]: This is going to be our big thing.

357
00:19:43,344 --> 00:19:45,866
[SPEAKER_02]: Watch the refined carbohydrates.

358
00:19:46,446 --> 00:19:47,487
[SPEAKER_02]: Watch the processed foods.

359
00:19:48,328 --> 00:19:50,309
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, even if it says low sodium on the can...

360
00:19:50,669 --> 00:19:51,830
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura.com.

361
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:09,359
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura.com

362
00:20:27,038 --> 00:20:31,643
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, that's a given, but you'd be surprised how hard that is sometimes.

363
00:20:31,663 --> 00:20:34,806
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd be surprised how much shit you're eating.

364
00:20:34,886 --> 00:20:37,228
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm honest, I eat a lot of shit.

365
00:20:37,588 --> 00:20:39,210
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really need to cut back on that.

366
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:41,011
[SPEAKER_01]: And you smell like it.

367
00:20:41,091 --> 00:20:43,774
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not, I don't mean actual poop shit.

368
00:20:44,014 --> 00:20:45,756
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean crappy food.

369
00:20:45,956 --> 00:20:46,236
[SPEAKER_06]: Bad food.

370
00:20:46,276 --> 00:20:49,399
[SPEAKER_06]: Like McDonald's, Burger King, all that fast food crap.

371
00:20:49,699 --> 00:20:50,280
[SPEAKER_01]: You know...

372
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,704
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody knows you're not stupid people.

373
00:20:54,024 --> 00:20:56,227
[SPEAKER_01]: You know how to download a podcast on the internet.

374
00:20:56,347 --> 00:20:57,028
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not dumb.

375
00:20:57,789 --> 00:20:59,972
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what's good for you and what's not good for you.

376
00:21:00,172 --> 00:21:02,795
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's okay to indulge once in a while.

377
00:21:04,017 --> 00:21:06,540
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know where I would be in this world without Chicken McNuggets.

378
00:21:07,781 --> 00:21:09,942
[SPEAKER_01]: But you don't order the 20 pack of chicken McNuggets.

379
00:21:10,062 --> 00:21:11,222
[SPEAKER_01]: And you don't do it every day.

380
00:21:11,402 --> 00:21:12,342
[SPEAKER_02]: Get a Happy Meal.

381
00:21:12,362 --> 00:21:13,063
[SPEAKER_01]: For one person.

382
00:21:13,143 --> 00:21:13,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Get a Happy Meal.

383
00:21:13,923 --> 00:21:14,103
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

384
00:21:14,723 --> 00:21:23,406
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the other bit of advice I have with this, and Dan is thankfully learning this now, is just the eat when you're hungry, stop when you're not.

385
00:21:23,566 --> 00:21:25,486
[SPEAKER_02]: Not when you're full, when you're not hungry.

386
00:21:25,686 --> 00:21:33,409
[SPEAKER_06]: And you also need to make sure you eat at regular intervals, breakfast, lunch, dinner, and maybe a small snack in between, but don't eat super late and stuff like that.

387
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:34,789
[SPEAKER_02]: I eat it eight times a day.

388
00:21:35,675 --> 00:21:38,117
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, that's good if you eat small meals a day.

389
00:21:38,137 --> 00:21:40,019
[SPEAKER_02]: But I eat about 100-200 calories a pop.

390
00:21:40,119 --> 00:21:40,619
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

391
00:21:40,639 --> 00:21:41,560
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a small meal.

392
00:21:41,841 --> 00:21:45,063
[SPEAKER_02]: But as long as I stick with my mostly raw food, I don't have to track what I eat.

393
00:21:45,444 --> 00:21:47,125
[SPEAKER_02]: The one problem is that I don't get enough sodium.

394
00:21:48,366 --> 00:21:48,686
[SPEAKER_02]: Irony.

395
00:21:48,887 --> 00:21:49,908
[SPEAKER_06]: You have the opposite problem.

396
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:51,209
[SPEAKER_02]: I have the opposite problem, yep.

397
00:21:51,249 --> 00:21:51,909
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

398
00:21:52,209 --> 00:21:55,693
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I eat mostly fruits and vegetables, and they're raw and processed.

399
00:21:56,453 --> 00:21:58,375
[SPEAKER_02]: If they're processed, it's because I threw them in my blender.

400
00:21:59,755 --> 00:22:23,105
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know you eat beef occasionally Sometimes When the PMS monster hits We don't talk about that I talk about it all the time This is important to say There's nothing wrong if you are a little fluffy Everybody's a little fluffy It's fine Love yourself the way you are But make sure that you pay attention to your health Just be fluffy and healthy

401
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:25,346
[SPEAKER_02]: Low Weight Obesity

402
00:22:50,191 --> 00:22:54,903
[SPEAKER_02]: Meaning that they had a higher range of fat to muscle ratio than these other people did.

403
00:22:54,943 --> 00:22:55,625
[SPEAKER_06]: Never heard of that.

404
00:22:55,745 --> 00:22:56,768
[SPEAKER_06]: Low weight obesity.

405
00:22:59,127 --> 00:22:59,587
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching!

406
00:23:20,643 --> 00:23:20,903
[SPEAKER_01]: True.

407
00:23:20,923 --> 00:23:21,203
[SPEAKER_01]: True enough.

408
00:23:43,513 --> 00:23:50,138
[SPEAKER_01]: We do reach a wide audience on this show, so if we can save one other person from having to go to the hospital, then... I was so mad.

409
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:50,478
[SPEAKER_01]: 20... I was mad.

410
00:23:50,998 --> 00:23:51,679
[SPEAKER_01]: Your mic again.

411
00:23:51,899 --> 00:23:52,699
[SPEAKER_01]: Your mic's mad at you.

412
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:53,720
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

413
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:54,841
[SPEAKER_02]: I was mad.

414
00:23:55,541 --> 00:23:57,903
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, once I got over being worried, I was mad.

415
00:23:58,443 --> 00:24:01,265
[SPEAKER_02]: Because honestly, who does he have to blame for what happened to him?

416
00:24:01,846 --> 00:24:02,146
[SPEAKER_02]: Himself.

417
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:06,569
[SPEAKER_02]: When my jeans get snug, who do I have to blame for that?

418
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:09,652
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, sometimes I have, you know, PMS to blame for that.

419
00:24:10,012 --> 00:24:12,514
[SPEAKER_02]: But usually it's me.

420
00:24:13,275 --> 00:24:15,796
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we have to be responsible for ourselves.

421
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:24,703
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing, like all those morons out there who are out there suing McDonald's and shit because, Oh, I ate your hamburgers and I got overweight.

422
00:24:25,004 --> 00:24:26,885
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, don't eat the damn food, stupid.

423
00:24:28,326 --> 00:24:28,967
[SPEAKER_02]: End of story.

424
00:24:30,368 --> 00:24:32,509
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so anyway, I'm sorry for going off that.

425
00:24:32,529 --> 00:24:33,270
[SPEAKER_02]: So how about my games, Rob?

426
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:34,521
[SPEAKER_01]: How about your games?

427
00:24:34,541 --> 00:24:35,462
[SPEAKER_01]: You already mentioned games.

428
00:24:35,482 --> 00:24:36,143
[SPEAKER_01]: You didn't play a lot.

429
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:37,865
[SPEAKER_02]: But Star Trek Online Episode 2 came out.

430
00:24:38,086 --> 00:24:38,186
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh.

431
00:24:38,406 --> 00:24:44,654
[SPEAKER_02]: Which I got... Now, my hand has been killing me because... Oh, on top of all this crap with Dan, my hand's infected.

432
00:24:45,195 --> 00:24:45,795
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay!

433
00:24:45,875 --> 00:24:47,117
[SPEAKER_02]: When I move my finger, it squishes.

434
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:48,701
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not good.

435
00:25:06,038 --> 00:25:08,019
[SPEAKER_06]: Star Trek Online Warp Core Breach Warp Core Breach

436
00:25:32,071 --> 00:25:33,132
[SPEAKER_01]: I meant eject the warp core.

437
00:25:33,332 --> 00:25:36,934
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, my mind goes to the drink automatically, but yeah, eject the warp core because of a breach.

438
00:25:36,954 --> 00:25:38,375
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that was like every episode of Star Trek.

439
00:25:38,395 --> 00:25:39,316
[SPEAKER_01]: They had to eject the warp core.

440
00:25:39,336 --> 00:25:42,297
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I did find that the warp core breach was a legitimate drink from the show.

441
00:25:43,038 --> 00:25:44,118
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh.

442
00:25:44,819 --> 00:25:46,800
[SPEAKER_02]: And he pulled it out in the same bowl and everything.

443
00:25:47,401 --> 00:25:47,781
[SPEAKER_02]: Cork did.

444
00:25:48,541 --> 00:25:48,921
[SPEAKER_01]: Good times.

445
00:25:48,961 --> 00:25:49,222
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway.

446
00:25:49,522 --> 00:25:49,762
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

447
00:25:50,863 --> 00:25:51,743
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that it for your gaming week?

448
00:25:53,784 --> 00:25:54,145
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

449
00:25:54,645 --> 00:25:58,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan's buddy, Will, started Crackdown 2, so we just kept making fun of the boss.

450
00:25:59,568 --> 00:26:00,549
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, shut up, dude.

451
00:26:00,589 --> 00:26:00,929
[SPEAKER_02]: We know.

452
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:02,772
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway.

453
00:26:04,694 --> 00:26:11,399
[SPEAKER_01]: My gaming week, you know, obviously I played a lot of Warcraft as a chatter earlier said, but yourself.

454
00:26:13,941 --> 00:26:21,447
[SPEAKER_01]: Our little raid group finally cleared the Trial of the Champion on Ten Man, which yes, I know is like behind where most guilds are at right now, but we just started raiding like

455
00:26:21,807 --> 00:26:23,128
[SPEAKER_01]: Last month, so shut up.

456
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:23,808
[SPEAKER_01]: We're awesome.

457
00:26:24,668 --> 00:26:25,148
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was fun.

458
00:26:25,789 --> 00:26:31,691
[SPEAKER_01]: And other than that, though, I've been trying to play games other than WoW, but I didn't have a lot of success this week.

459
00:26:31,771 --> 00:26:33,712
[SPEAKER_01]: I did play some Game Room.

460
00:26:33,932 --> 00:26:36,353
[SPEAKER_01]: I played Frostbite on Game Room, which just came out.

461
00:26:36,373 --> 00:26:39,994
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an old, old, old school Atari 2600 game that I remember from when I was a kid.

462
00:26:40,014 --> 00:26:50,238
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to stay up and play that for hours, and it's still kind of cool, although I think a lot of you that don't get the classic gaming thing will not get this either, so I don't expect everybody to run out and download it.

463
00:26:50,438 --> 00:26:51,058
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

464
00:27:11,734 --> 00:27:28,531
[SPEAKER_01]: as an assassin before I was playing the paladin-y type of class that was more of a defender and it's just like the matches went on forever but as an assassin I'm just like cutting people left and right it's awesome and this time I hope to not miss any side quests like I did the first time you know that reminds me of when you were going around saying bitch I cut you

465
00:27:29,215 --> 00:27:31,578
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's kind of like that, but now on Puzzle Quest.

466
00:27:32,259 --> 00:27:33,160
[SPEAKER_01]: New games this week.

467
00:27:33,261 --> 00:27:39,349
[SPEAKER_01]: I did check out just the demo for Hydro Thunder Hurricane because I wanted to see, and Jamie's yelling it's awesome.

468
00:27:40,551 --> 00:27:42,413
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually didn't really agree with her.

469
00:27:42,633 --> 00:27:45,317
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just kind of like, eh, it's okay.

470
00:27:46,879 --> 00:27:57,290
[SPEAKER_01]: There's something about playing that game in a big old cabinet at the arcade with other people that was much more fun to me than sitting at home in my chair playing it on my Xbox controller.

471
00:27:57,390 --> 00:27:57,771
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

472
00:27:57,871 --> 00:27:58,792
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wasn't feeling it.

473
00:27:59,533 --> 00:28:01,335
[SPEAKER_01]: The graphics didn't do it for me either.

474
00:28:01,355 --> 00:28:02,596
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just something about it.

475
00:28:02,636 --> 00:28:03,637
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like it wasn't...

476
00:28:05,018 --> 00:28:05,479
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.

477
00:28:05,659 --> 00:28:08,420
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, again, I'm only playing a demo.

478
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:10,321
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not trying to review the whole game.

479
00:28:10,361 --> 00:28:13,603
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just saying, was I sold on the game based on what I played?

480
00:28:13,903 --> 00:28:14,163
[SPEAKER_01]: Nah.

481
00:28:14,543 --> 00:28:17,244
[SPEAKER_01]: So I ended up passing on the full version.

482
00:28:17,564 --> 00:28:23,367
[SPEAKER_01]: Jamie's yelling she bought the full version, but she is not in a mic right now, so we can't hear her.

483
00:28:23,467 --> 00:28:24,808
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't hear you.

484
00:28:25,448 --> 00:28:25,748
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.

485
00:28:27,049 --> 00:28:28,450
[SPEAKER_01]: So what else did I play this week?

486
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:33,774
[SPEAKER_01]: Sadly, I didn't play StarCraft 2, although it seems like everybody's been playing that because I haven't picked it up yet.

487
00:28:34,255 --> 00:28:37,237
[SPEAKER_01]: It's too much money right now.

488
00:28:37,497 --> 00:28:39,959
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems to be all that most of you guys are talking about.

489
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:41,961
[SPEAKER_06]: StarCraft 2, DC Universe.

490
00:28:42,945 --> 00:29:01,531
[SPEAKER_02]: DC Universe I'm excited about there's that new trailer out for DC Universe that looked pretty hot Dan got Starcraft 2 and it's gorgeous and the collector's edition comes with all the old versions and we did get Hydra Thunder Hurricane except I can't play it right now and he loves it but he loved the old one too really?

491
00:29:01,711 --> 00:29:10,134
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know maybe I was just in a bad mood you'll have to see the new levels the level in I think it's in Turkey it's gorgeous

492
00:29:11,395 --> 00:29:12,996
[SPEAKER_01]: There was some interesting mechanics with it.

493
00:29:13,036 --> 00:29:19,040
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't hate it, but there's so much other games to play right now that I wasn't like, I want to drop $15 on this.

494
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:22,822
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially knowing that the Castlevania game is out next week, and I know I'm going to want that.

495
00:29:22,983 --> 00:29:25,124
[SPEAKER_01]: Just based on what games I've liked historically.

496
00:29:25,164 --> 00:29:29,607
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem, I think, with the game so far is the way that you unlock the levels.

497
00:29:30,367 --> 00:29:33,689
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you have to keep playing and keep playing and earn credits, and then you unlock the levels.

498
00:29:33,889 --> 00:29:34,930
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not as cool.

499
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:35,290
[SPEAKER_01]: Hmm.

500
00:29:37,072 --> 00:29:38,333
[SPEAKER_01]: Other games I've been playing this week.

501
00:29:38,834 --> 00:29:43,139
[SPEAKER_01]: On the PC, I actually bought a game on Steam called Rhythm Zone.

502
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:50,587
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a $9 game that is basically Guitar Hero for your computer, but you use the keys to play.

503
00:29:51,208 --> 00:29:55,712
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe you can plug in USB devices, but gonna be honest, didn't really look into that.

504
00:29:56,413 --> 00:29:57,494
[SPEAKER_01]: I just played it with a keyboard.

505
00:29:58,095 --> 00:30:23,964
[SPEAKER_01]: the thing about the game is that yes it has a library of songs that it comes with but it also will make a note chart to any mp3 on your drive as you can possibly imagine if you've ever played one of those DDR games that makes up the steps to the music as it goes along usually the note patterns that show up kind of blow and it's just like let's bang on random keys to my mp3 collection that's really a more appropriate title for the game

506
00:30:24,904 --> 00:30:28,025
[SPEAKER_01]: The game is just a straight up jack of Guitar Hero.

507
00:30:28,245 --> 00:30:34,046
[SPEAKER_01]: Really doesn't add anything new to the mix except for, ooh, I can bang random keys to my MP3s.

508
00:30:34,967 --> 00:30:41,308
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, for some inexplicable reason, the screen likes to slowly rotate to the left and to the right.

509
00:30:41,808 --> 00:30:50,051
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why, but suddenly, like, you know, you're doing... Like, imagine if you were playing Guitar Hero and then just suddenly the whole screen started to rotate to the left, like 45 degrees.

510
00:30:50,451 --> 00:30:51,591
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd be like, what?

511
00:30:52,091 --> 00:30:53,232
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

512
00:31:10,843 --> 00:31:19,671
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess the one nice thing I could say about it is that it does seem like they have saved room to expand the game later on.

513
00:31:20,592 --> 00:31:28,739
[SPEAKER_01]: So as long as they don't make me pay for any of those expansions, because $9 is already too much for what I got, that might be redeeming.

514
00:31:29,399 --> 00:31:31,021
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm not gonna hold my breath.

515
00:31:32,222 --> 00:31:33,683
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that's Rhythm Zone on Steam.

516
00:31:34,704 --> 00:31:35,124
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a fan.

517
00:31:35,645 --> 00:31:35,745
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

518
00:31:36,725 --> 00:31:42,327
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see, that otherwise is pretty much it, especially as far as new stuff goes.

519
00:31:42,647 --> 00:31:44,227
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't really play a whole lot of other new stuff.

520
00:31:44,467 --> 00:31:46,187
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to turn it over to Myla.

521
00:31:46,588 --> 00:31:47,788
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you been playing anything this week?

522
00:31:47,808 --> 00:31:48,408
[SPEAKER_01]: New or old?

523
00:31:48,908 --> 00:31:54,329
[SPEAKER_04]: Not only have I been playing something, but I am playing something currently, RuneScape.

524
00:31:54,549 --> 00:31:55,290
[SPEAKER_04]: It's my new crack.

525
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:56,710
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's my old crack.

526
00:31:56,750 --> 00:32:00,391
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been a member of this wonderful game for...

527
00:32:01,511 --> 00:32:03,413
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, since 1998.

528
00:32:04,153 --> 00:32:05,214
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not hearing you very well.

529
00:32:05,254 --> 00:32:06,034
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that mic's good.

530
00:32:06,094 --> 00:32:06,515
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.

531
00:32:06,815 --> 00:32:07,075
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it up?

532
00:32:07,375 --> 00:32:08,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay, yay, it's up.

533
00:32:09,017 --> 00:32:10,858
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been playing RuneScape since 1998.

534
00:32:11,258 --> 00:32:18,063
[SPEAKER_04]: I was a member, or not a member, but a free player back when the wilderness was PvP.

535
00:32:18,443 --> 00:32:19,404
[SPEAKER_04]: What a concept!

536
00:32:20,445 --> 00:32:25,589
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they switched it over to PvP servers, which just made a lot of us just very unhappy.

537
00:32:25,609 --> 00:32:26,029
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

538
00:32:26,549 --> 00:32:50,663
[SPEAKER_04]: um but then they released uh about a year ago they released the Dungeoneering skill which is what I'm working on right now and it just it brings a whole new level to the game it's you know originally RuneScape was you know something you played on the weekends when you're bored and didn't have really anything to do and you know you do one skill and then you do another skill and it's just kind of you know kind of monotonous kind of stuff and it's really fun and

539
00:32:51,443 --> 00:32:52,164
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

540
00:33:07,583 --> 00:33:09,685
[SPEAKER_04]: But you also use your crafting skill to make new armor.

541
00:33:10,146 --> 00:33:14,710
[SPEAKER_04]: And you jump into the Dungeoneering levels with no equipment.

542
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:16,912
[SPEAKER_04]: You build your own equipment.

543
00:33:16,952 --> 00:33:17,953
[SPEAKER_04]: You build your own things.

544
00:33:18,133 --> 00:33:24,219
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything that you do in the Dungeoneering is based off your regular stats.

545
00:33:24,819 --> 00:33:30,405
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's amazing because it really, you know, for those people like me who spent the, you know,

546
00:33:30,745 --> 00:33:31,305
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

547
00:33:57,518 --> 00:34:01,962
[SPEAKER_04]: When you're soloing, it's a little more difficult, but you get more of the feel of the skill.

548
00:34:02,542 --> 00:34:11,050
[SPEAKER_04]: When you're doing the four-member parties, especially in the earlier levels, it really feels like you're just running in a dungeon, wasting everything, and keep going.

549
00:34:11,490 --> 00:34:15,874
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you're maybe at the boss for like maybe, you know, 15 seconds.

550
00:34:16,335 --> 00:34:19,097
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds like playing a PSO back in the day.

551
00:34:19,338 --> 00:34:19,538
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm.

552
00:34:20,498 --> 00:34:24,860
[SPEAKER_04]: But as you go down into the levels, the skill increases.

553
00:34:25,341 --> 00:34:26,842
[SPEAKER_04]: But therein lies the problem.

554
00:34:27,042 --> 00:34:37,507
[SPEAKER_04]: Whenever you start a Dungeoneering level, it takes how many people are going in, and then from there it determines which level you start in.

555
00:34:38,228 --> 00:34:41,550
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you've been soloing for a long time...

556
00:34:42,851 --> 00:34:52,660
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll be at level 14, and the dungeons will be really harder, but if you don't do a lot of the four-mans or three-mans, you'll be stuck at the first couple of levels, and you'll be going, Where's the challenge?

557
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:53,561
[SPEAKER_04]: What's going on?

558
00:34:53,941 --> 00:34:54,641
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything's easy!

559
00:34:54,762 --> 00:34:55,282
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell?

560
00:34:56,163 --> 00:34:59,646
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a little different, but it's really fun.

561
00:35:00,026 --> 00:35:01,067
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really, really fun.

562
00:35:01,148 --> 00:35:03,109
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, RuneScape's been around since 98?

563
00:35:03,289 --> 00:35:03,490
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

564
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:04,771
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my gosh.

565
00:35:04,871 --> 00:35:05,832
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been around forever.

566
00:35:06,092 --> 00:35:06,192
[SPEAKER_04]: It's...

567
00:35:07,333 --> 00:35:09,375
[SPEAKER_01]: Have they done major makeovers to it since then?

568
00:35:10,276 --> 00:35:11,177
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of those things.

569
00:35:11,258 --> 00:35:15,222
[SPEAKER_04]: RuneScape, it's been slowly evolving over the years.

570
00:35:15,943 --> 00:35:18,245
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll release a patch here, a patch there.

571
00:35:18,946 --> 00:35:27,875
[SPEAKER_04]: Dungeoneering's really the first full world patch and update that they've done in literally years.

572
00:35:28,796 --> 00:35:29,697
[SPEAKER_04]: Shoot, I'm dying.

573
00:35:55,181 --> 00:35:56,041
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you playing RuneScape right now?

574
00:35:56,061 --> 00:35:58,424
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm playing RuneScape right now and I'm just about to die.

575
00:35:58,744 --> 00:36:02,347
[SPEAKER_04]: But the good news is if you die in the Dungeoneering skill, they just pop you back to the home world.

576
00:36:03,148 --> 00:36:09,394
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the only thing that death in Dungeoneering really accomplishes is, yes, you get a sucky score at the end.

577
00:36:09,594 --> 00:36:10,315
[SPEAKER_04]: That's about all it does.

578
00:36:12,048 --> 00:36:20,271
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there's some folks in chat, I see Drew Nami is in chat and he's saying RuneScape with kind of one of those like, you know, whatever faces.

579
00:36:20,972 --> 00:36:24,293
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think he's a fan of RuneScape, but it's free, right?

580
00:36:24,353 --> 00:36:24,793
[SPEAKER_01]: It's free.

581
00:36:25,273 --> 00:36:28,214
[SPEAKER_04]: That's one of the... Is it better than Yaris?

582
00:36:28,294 --> 00:36:29,455
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gotta be better than Yaris.

583
00:36:30,095 --> 00:36:33,897
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, my cat's stinky butt is better than Yaris.

584
00:36:37,288 --> 00:36:40,270
[SPEAKER_01]: TigerClaw in our chatroom says StarCraft 2 is a huge graphical upgrade.

585
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:41,951
[SPEAKER_01]: It's no longer the pixelated graphics.

586
00:36:41,971 --> 00:36:43,231
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything is all 3D graphics.

587
00:36:43,291 --> 00:36:44,172
[SPEAKER_01]: No, yeah, yeah.

588
00:36:44,252 --> 00:36:47,874
[SPEAKER_02]: All the cinematic areas are in-game, are real-time.

589
00:36:48,134 --> 00:37:00,941
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, and I understand that, but my point was is that, you know, RuneScape, yeah, it's from 98, and people are still playing it today, which might seem weird, but I was just saying, like, StarCraft was out only one year later than that, and hell of people still playing that.

590
00:37:01,301 --> 00:37:03,022
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been playing Ragnarok Online since 97.

591
00:37:03,803 --> 00:37:04,443
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, my.

592
00:37:04,823 --> 00:37:05,824
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that game really that old?

593
00:37:06,707 --> 00:37:07,107
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty old.

594
00:37:07,387 --> 00:37:08,068
[SPEAKER_02]: I can double check.

595
00:37:09,028 --> 00:37:12,189
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it was out in Korea before that, and I was playing on the Japanese servers for a little while.

596
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:16,071
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I was playing on the open beta for IRO.

597
00:37:18,352 --> 00:37:18,812
[SPEAKER_01]: Old games.

598
00:37:19,512 --> 00:37:20,553
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still playing it, too.

599
00:37:20,813 --> 00:37:22,193
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything else you want to give a shout-out to in a game?

600
00:37:24,094 --> 00:37:25,174
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, hey, Drew.

601
00:37:25,995 --> 00:37:28,276
[SPEAKER_04]: Other than that, no, not really.

602
00:37:29,316 --> 00:37:32,717
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm literally in the middle of a dungeon right now, and I'm kind of milling through it.

603
00:37:33,098 --> 00:37:34,658
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, we'll try not to suck up all our bandwidth.

604
00:37:34,678 --> 00:37:34,978
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't.

605
00:37:35,058 --> 00:37:35,279
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't.

606
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:41,160
[SPEAKER_01]: Gary, now I know you said beforehand you weren't too much of a console.

607
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,520
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, you might be a PC gamer?

608
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:44,161
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I used to be console.

609
00:37:44,181 --> 00:37:47,681
[SPEAKER_06]: I grew up with an 8 and 16-bit Nintendo.

610
00:37:48,321 --> 00:37:50,962
[SPEAKER_06]: Original Final Fantasy, awesome.

611
00:37:51,182 --> 00:37:54,563
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a PlayStation 2 that hasn't seen much use lately.

612
00:37:54,983 --> 00:37:58,423
[SPEAKER_06]: More as a DVD player than a game console.

613
00:37:58,983 --> 00:38:01,244
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'd get back into it.

614
00:38:02,144 --> 00:38:08,726
[SPEAKER_06]: and I picked up a couple of computer games and I always actively look for interesting looking computer games.

615
00:38:10,066 --> 00:38:13,107
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm seriously looking at Batman Arkham Asylum.

616
00:38:13,947 --> 00:38:14,807
[SPEAKER_06]: That game is great.

617
00:38:15,987 --> 00:38:17,448
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, another recommendation.

618
00:38:18,208 --> 00:38:21,328
[SPEAKER_06]: The reviews seem to be glowing all around so it's probably something I'm going to have to pick up.

619
00:38:21,568 --> 00:38:27,070
[SPEAKER_01]: If you like the Batman universe, they've got a lot of the voice actors from the animated series.

620
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:28,370
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good.

621
00:38:28,578 --> 00:38:29,138
[SPEAKER_06]: DC Universe Online

622
00:38:58,427 --> 00:39:26,723
[SPEAKER_01]: if you want to comment on anything we're talking about tonight chat.orangeloungeradio.com is the place to be or on the Game Surge Network we are in channel Orange Lounge we don't use the regular all games chat room I don't know why it's just we always had a separate room and that way when we have a separate room we're in control and have ops and all that stuff we're just control freaks alright let's see so I was going to ask you about tabletop games I know we don't talk a lot about tabletop games but briefly what types of tabletop games do you play?

623
00:39:27,363 --> 00:39:29,064
[SPEAKER_06]: Dungeons & Dragons 4th Edition.

624
00:39:29,204 --> 00:39:30,864
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, okay, stop with the boos.

625
00:39:30,984 --> 00:39:32,064
[SPEAKER_06]: Stop with the boos.

626
00:39:33,164 --> 00:39:34,085
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not bad.

627
00:39:34,125 --> 00:39:37,826
[SPEAKER_06]: You can do anything, just about anything in 4th Edition you can do into previous ones.

628
00:39:38,426 --> 00:39:42,047
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm clueless when it comes to this stuff because I haven't played D&D in a while.

629
00:39:42,147 --> 00:39:45,047
[SPEAKER_01]: I played a little bit like two years ago, but that maybe lasted a month.

630
00:39:46,228 --> 00:39:48,008
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are people so mad about 4th Edition?

631
00:39:48,348 --> 00:39:49,750
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

632
00:40:06,313 --> 00:40:09,835
[SPEAKER_06]: The teleportation is line of sight, very short distances.

633
00:40:10,815 --> 00:40:12,896
[SPEAKER_06]: But you know, it's not bad.

634
00:40:13,797 --> 00:40:14,938
[SPEAKER_06]: You just gotta give it a try.

635
00:40:15,838 --> 00:40:19,621
[SPEAKER_06]: The teleporting in previous editions, especially in 3rd, was crazy.

636
00:40:20,061 --> 00:40:21,362
[SPEAKER_06]: It got to the point where a party would...

637
00:40:22,142 --> 00:40:27,304
[SPEAKER_06]: Teleport would scry, teleport, and kill the main boss, and that was your whole campaign in the teen levels.

638
00:40:27,845 --> 00:40:30,126
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, 3.5 D&D tended to break.

639
00:40:30,326 --> 00:40:36,768
[SPEAKER_06]: The entire system broke around 16th to 18th level because they just hadn't... It was a design thing.

640
00:40:36,928 --> 00:40:42,451
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, what it kind of reminded me of was the difference between, you know, WoW in the early levels is, you know...

641
00:40:42,751 --> 00:40:43,391
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of alright.

642
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:48,234
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have a lot of things, but you can still level up pretty quickly.

643
00:40:48,354 --> 00:40:53,416
[SPEAKER_04]: With 4th Ed, it almost reminds me of the first couple levels of Final Fantasy XI.

644
00:40:54,036 --> 00:40:56,317
[SPEAKER_04]: Until you get to 10, you're crap.

645
00:40:57,138 --> 00:41:02,961
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the big misconceptions about 4th Edition is it's an MMO on tabletop.

646
00:41:03,381 --> 00:41:05,042
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's not an MMO on tabletop.

647
00:41:05,102 --> 00:41:08,383
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, they share terminology with World of Warcraft.

648
00:41:08,783 --> 00:41:11,465
[SPEAKER_06]: It makes it convenient, but you can still do...

649
00:41:12,205 --> 00:41:19,076
[SPEAKER_06]: This is not a ding on computer console games, but you can still do more because you have a living person who can keep making up the story.

650
00:41:19,397 --> 00:41:20,879
[SPEAKER_01]: You're only limited by your imagination.

651
00:41:20,899 --> 00:41:21,500
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, exactly.

652
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:22,442
[SPEAKER_06]: Whereas, you know...

653
00:41:24,744 --> 00:41:49,936
[SPEAKER_06]: that's right well yes and you know house rules in a in a home game is the name of the game so I mean you can change the system to a point um and if if there's something that somebody wants to do you know it's just it's it depends on what you like I mean people who don't like fourth edition go play Pathfinder that's fine nothing no problem there I'm glad Paizo was around to put out an alternative for the folks that that didn't like the genre shift but

654
00:41:50,456 --> 00:41:51,337
[SPEAKER_06]: I enjoy Fourth.

655
00:41:52,818 --> 00:41:58,821
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm hoping that they'll license or put out a computer game based on the Fourth Edition rule set.

656
00:41:59,662 --> 00:42:04,044
[SPEAKER_06]: I know Wizards of the Coast was having some issues with Atari as their game publisher.

657
00:42:04,104 --> 00:42:06,466
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if those got worked out yet or not.

658
00:42:07,206 --> 00:42:09,067
[SPEAKER_06]: But I like Fourth Edition.

659
00:42:09,147 --> 00:42:12,649
[SPEAKER_06]: I also like hero games, superheroes, champions.

660
00:42:14,090 --> 00:42:14,931
[SPEAKER_12]: I play Champions.

661
00:42:15,471 --> 00:42:18,773
[SPEAKER_06]: Champions is fun, but it's a very, very numbers-heavy game.

662
00:42:20,014 --> 00:42:24,737
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not a math guy, so I need a character generator to keep the stuff straight.

663
00:42:24,857 --> 00:42:29,100
[SPEAKER_06]: But, eh, you know, I haven't played the Champions Online MMO.

664
00:42:30,281 --> 00:42:38,986
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm told it's very different in its mechanics, and they just licensed... Actually, they bought the Champions name from Hero Games and then licensed it back to them.

665
00:42:39,407 --> 00:42:40,487
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an interesting arrangement.

666
00:42:40,607 --> 00:42:41,068
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.

667
00:42:41,508 --> 00:42:42,109
[SPEAKER_06]: Dundracon

668
00:43:00,968 --> 00:43:28,751
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, they got 6th edition Hero now Is the current edition of that And I have yet to play it But I'm looking forward to doing something different than D&D very soon I've been playing Dungeons & Dragons since 3rd edition came out Pretty much uninterrupted straight Wow Yeah, steady diet You kind of get tired of it after a little while I just, it's the fantasy thing I'm ready for a genre shift myself I want to do a nice steampunk game

669
00:43:29,071 --> 00:43:40,974
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me get to some comments from our chatroom at chat.orange.com Without turning into a tabletop gaming show, although it is important, you know, a lot of computer games we play today are inspired, like Champions Online is a perfect example, directly inspired by the tabletop universe.

670
00:43:41,014 --> 00:43:43,555
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, without D&D, you wouldn't have World of Warcraft.

671
00:43:43,635 --> 00:43:44,115
[SPEAKER_01]: No way.

672
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:46,516
[SPEAKER_01]: Or probably even stuff like Final Fantasy.

673
00:43:46,776 --> 00:43:47,556
[SPEAKER_01]: Nope.

674
00:43:47,676 --> 00:43:48,116
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.

675
00:43:48,396 --> 00:43:52,637
[SPEAKER_01]: Comments from our chatroom at chat.orange.com Shaoran says, that's not why 4th edition isn't as good.

676
00:43:52,697 --> 00:43:55,018
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not as good because there's next to no customization.

677
00:43:55,218 --> 00:43:55,958
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not true.

678
00:43:56,498 --> 00:43:56,838
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, boy.

679
00:43:57,419 --> 00:43:57,739
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

680
00:43:57,779 --> 00:43:59,800
[SPEAKER_01]: How about we save the debate for another time?

681
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:00,601
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, yes.

682
00:44:00,901 --> 00:44:05,043
[SPEAKER_01]: Monty Boggs says, none of my group wants to spend money on the new books, so we haven't upgraded.

683
00:44:06,604 --> 00:44:09,866
[SPEAKER_01]: Shaoran clarified, though, at least in terms of skills and multi-classing.

684
00:44:10,306 --> 00:44:13,368
[SPEAKER_06]: That's also... No fan of the flames.

685
00:44:13,488 --> 00:44:14,689
[SPEAKER_12]: I will leave it at this.

686
00:44:15,409 --> 00:44:16,930
[SPEAKER_12]: I still love second edition for a reason.

687
00:44:17,952 --> 00:44:19,633
[SPEAKER_01]: Take your THACO and shove it.

688
00:44:19,773 --> 00:44:20,053
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I have.

689
00:44:20,073 --> 00:44:22,695
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, I can calculate my THACO in my sleep, sir.

690
00:44:22,715 --> 00:44:25,817
[SPEAKER_06]: THACO in low saving throws, high attack rolls, yes.

691
00:44:25,937 --> 00:44:29,960
[SPEAKER_01]: Camara says the fourth edition book talked down to me like I was a child.

692
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:31,861
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what the dice looks like.

693
00:44:31,961 --> 00:44:33,042
[SPEAKER_01]: This is how you roll it.

694
00:44:33,422 --> 00:44:35,884
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's a problem I've always had with Wizards of the Coast.

695
00:44:36,045 --> 00:44:38,107
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't write very well.

696
00:44:38,167 --> 00:44:40,509
[SPEAKER_06]: The game books aren't written very flavorfully.

697
00:44:40,529 --> 00:44:41,390
[SPEAKER_06]: We miss you, TSR.

698
00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:45,373
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, well, actually, that's one thing I like about White Wolf.

699
00:44:45,914 --> 00:44:51,799
[SPEAKER_06]: At least the old World of Darkness, the vampire, the werewolf books were written very flavorfully.

700
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,402
[SPEAKER_06]: You actually could feel the world when you were reading it.

701
00:44:54,702 --> 00:45:00,588
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and then they switched to New World and there was much sighing and gnashing of teeth.

702
00:45:01,009 --> 00:45:02,490
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't talk about New World of Darkness.

703
00:45:03,031 --> 00:45:04,533
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a subject that's left in the closet.

704
00:45:04,553 --> 00:45:07,376
[SPEAKER_02]: We've just made Jodea happy because we're talking about you.

705
00:45:07,396 --> 00:45:11,620
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pleasantly surprised at what a warm reception the tabletop chat is getting from our chat room.

706
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:14,683
[SPEAKER_01]: We may have to have a tabletop corner or something in the future.

707
00:45:14,723 --> 00:45:15,024
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

708
00:45:16,386 --> 00:45:16,847
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll do it.

709
00:45:17,267 --> 00:45:18,089
[SPEAKER_06]: TSR is dead.

710
00:45:18,129 --> 00:45:23,499
[SPEAKER_06]: They died of their own money grubbing, but unfortunately it looks like Wizards of the Coast might be going the same way.

711
00:45:23,819 --> 00:45:24,641
[SPEAKER_06]: Eh, that's life.

712
00:45:25,109 --> 00:45:28,130
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's get into some housekeeping here so we can get to the video game news of the week.

713
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:30,671
[SPEAKER_01]: Housekeeping going on here at Orange Lounge Radio.

714
00:45:31,351 --> 00:45:39,534
[SPEAKER_01]: I mentioned a Facebook ad campaign earlier, and just to tell you guys what's going on, it doesn't really directly affect the show, but we decided to try a little something something.

715
00:45:40,054 --> 00:45:41,694
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't make any money doing OLR.

716
00:45:41,734 --> 00:45:42,875
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to make that very clear.

717
00:45:42,935 --> 00:45:44,055
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have ads during the show.

718
00:45:44,075 --> 00:45:44,955
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have any on the site.

719
00:45:45,115 --> 00:45:45,335
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?

720
00:45:45,375 --> 00:45:46,116
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.

721
00:45:46,156 --> 00:45:48,496
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't for eight years made money doing OLR.

722
00:45:50,277 --> 00:45:55,359
[SPEAKER_01]: So the only exception would be donations, which we don't actively solicit them at all.

723
00:45:55,399 --> 00:46:05,322
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have a PayPal link or anything, but folks in the past have donated generously to the show, and that's kept us definitely going, be it bandwidth, time, whatever it is, not necessarily just money.

724
00:46:06,362 --> 00:46:08,183
[SPEAKER_01]: But we decided, what the hell, let's take...

725
00:46:08,843 --> 00:46:10,044
[SPEAKER_01]: www.facebook.com slash orangeloungeradio

726
00:46:37,162 --> 00:46:38,004
[SPEAKER_01]: We're also on Twitter.

727
00:46:38,024 --> 00:46:39,266
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be taking Twitter topics later.

728
00:46:39,306 --> 00:46:41,230
[SPEAKER_01]: Twitter.com slash OLR.

729
00:46:42,112 --> 00:46:42,492
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

730
00:46:43,374 --> 00:46:45,438
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's all I have for housekeeping tonight.

731
00:46:45,498 --> 00:46:47,301
[SPEAKER_01]: So why don't we get into some actual gaming news?

732
00:46:49,082 --> 00:46:49,282
[SPEAKER_01]: StarCraft 2

733
00:47:07,781 --> 00:47:11,843
[SPEAKER_01]: StarCraft 2 sold 1.8 million copies on day one.

734
00:47:12,164 --> 00:47:14,605
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not counting Korea, just so you know.

735
00:47:14,645 --> 00:47:15,425
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not counting Korea?

736
00:47:15,445 --> 00:47:16,506
[SPEAKER_01]: Not counting Korea.

737
00:47:17,286 --> 00:47:19,527
[SPEAKER_01]: So 1.8 million on the first day.

738
00:47:20,328 --> 00:47:22,069
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Americas and Europe.

739
00:47:23,109 --> 00:47:27,051
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep in mind, though, I want to say, didn't World of Warcraft sell a little more?

740
00:47:27,372 --> 00:47:31,734
[SPEAKER_01]: Not original WoW, but like Wrath of the Lich King sold what, like 2.8, I think, on day one?

741
00:47:31,914 --> 00:47:35,517
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, can you give us some other numbers for context of that?

742
00:47:35,898 --> 00:47:38,300
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to say World of Warcraft, Wrath of the Lich King, yeah.

743
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:39,461
[SPEAKER_01]: It's here later in the story.

744
00:47:40,081 --> 00:47:42,303
[SPEAKER_01]: 2.8 million units on day one as well.

745
00:47:42,443 --> 00:47:43,825
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's another Blizzard game.

746
00:47:44,085 --> 00:47:44,866
[SPEAKER_01]: But here's the difference.

747
00:47:45,146 --> 00:47:52,833
[SPEAKER_01]: With an MMO, especially one like WoW, there's this huge need to be the first person on the server at level 80.

748
00:47:53,093 --> 00:47:53,613
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?

749
00:47:53,934 --> 00:47:56,116
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of people who want to go out and get it right away.

750
00:47:56,836 --> 00:48:01,137
[SPEAKER_01]: StarCraft 2 I think is a little different because I don't think everybody needs to jump on board with that.

751
00:48:01,217 --> 00:48:04,818
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't jump in right away but you know I was lining up.

752
00:48:05,078 --> 00:48:06,558
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't line up for Rathalich King.

753
00:48:06,578 --> 00:48:08,039
[SPEAKER_01]: I just went and got it the next day.

754
00:48:08,939 --> 00:48:11,860
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a lot of people I think that are just kind of chilling with StarCraft 2.

755
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:13,200
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have to get it right now.

756
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:16,021
[SPEAKER_01]: They can wait a little bit or at least for a price drop.

757
00:48:16,041 --> 00:48:17,981
[SPEAKER_01]: But then again, with Blizzard, good luck.

758
00:48:18,521 --> 00:48:19,141
[SPEAKER_01]: Good luck on that.

759
00:48:19,181 --> 00:48:20,922
[SPEAKER_01]: They're still charging $20 for Diablo 2.

760
00:48:20,962 --> 00:48:26,103
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I never heard anyone stressing over missing a raid in anything but World of Warcraft.

761
00:48:27,168 --> 00:48:40,537
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, as far as the original StarCraft goes, I actually got my copy from a friend who actually bet me money for whether or not I could beat him at StarCraft.

762
00:48:41,037 --> 00:48:44,520
[SPEAKER_04]: And I didn't know the game, so he's like, here, you borrow my copy.

763
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:48,462
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I played Zerg and whipped him good, so that teaches him.

764
00:48:48,842 --> 00:48:53,746
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm watching the trailer for StarCraft 2, Wings of Liberty, Ghosts of the Past.

765
00:48:53,786 --> 00:48:54,967
[SPEAKER_06]: Looks intriguing.

766
00:48:55,007 --> 00:48:56,888
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, that's an interesting monster.

767
00:48:57,969 --> 00:48:59,390
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, hooray for the Zerg.

768
00:48:59,750 --> 00:49:00,911
[SPEAKER_04]: Hooray for the Zerg.

769
00:49:01,371 --> 00:49:06,254
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how I feel about this whole splitting it up into three games, though, because really, you know, I don't know.

770
00:49:08,176 --> 00:49:22,606
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, even for splitting it up into three games, you know, they still gave some outrageous additions to some of the other, you know, like the Zerg, like the Protoss, you know, the exploding Zerglings I absolutely love.

771
00:49:22,986 --> 00:49:23,066
Yeah.

772
00:49:23,767 --> 00:49:41,646
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know enough about the StarCraft universe to even profess to say oh this is a good idea or no but I kind of think like okay kind of going from that wow fanboy perspective of maybe these are more like expansion packs these future releases are kind of like expansion packs in a way but they're also standalone because like

773
00:49:42,026 --> 00:49:43,107
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'll see you next time.

774
00:49:56,431 --> 00:49:56,611
[SPEAKER_01]: Hmm.

775
00:49:57,332 --> 00:49:57,492
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

776
00:49:57,512 --> 00:49:58,412
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.

777
00:49:58,533 --> 00:49:59,193
[SPEAKER_04]: Very much so.

778
00:49:59,853 --> 00:50:04,357
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a strange experiment they're trying, and it's getting them a lot of crap.

779
00:50:04,377 --> 00:50:12,282
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's a lot of people really pooping on StarCraft 2 because of the whole lack of LAN support, but that's... I hate to say it, I think it's more of a vocal minority than anything else.

780
00:50:12,322 --> 00:50:12,923
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

781
00:50:12,943 --> 00:50:14,784
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it's anything to...

782
00:50:14,924 --> 00:50:26,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, some of the, you know, looking at all the additions of what they made from the original game to the new game, it really makes, you know, each of the races a little more versatile.

783
00:50:27,092 --> 00:50:32,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, you know, with the original Zergs, you know, you really only had one option, Zerg Rush.

784
00:50:32,715 --> 00:50:33,016
[SPEAKER_04]: That was it.

785
00:50:33,216 --> 00:50:34,377
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the only way to really...

786
00:50:35,337 --> 00:50:43,440
[SPEAKER_04]: Make a dent into the opposing sides and to really thrive was just Zerg Rush.

787
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:45,040
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was really your only tactic.

788
00:50:45,460 --> 00:51:01,386
[SPEAKER_04]: With the new additions that they have, like the Explodies, Zerglingo Boom, it makes for a really interesting new way of playing for those people who are just used to one style for, you know...

789
00:51:02,908 --> 00:51:06,340
[SPEAKER_04]: for the individuals like the Protoss, like the Terrans.

790
00:51:07,389 --> 00:51:14,131
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, stepping away a little bit from the gameplay for a minute here to talk numbers again, because I think this is very interesting and could be very telling for the future.

791
00:51:14,911 --> 00:51:28,395
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, again, this report on VGCharts.com is estimating that 31% of those units were sold on Battle.net, meaning that about a third was all digital distribution directly through Battle.net.

792
00:51:29,475 --> 00:51:33,776
[SPEAKER_01]: That could be very, it's almost a telling sign of where GameStop's going to be in 10 years.

793
00:51:34,159 --> 00:51:40,288
[SPEAKER_06]: So do you think games on DVD, CD are going to be obsolete and you just download it in the future?

794
00:51:40,629 --> 00:51:41,590
[SPEAKER_06]: How long do you think it's going to take?

795
00:51:41,610 --> 00:51:42,792
[SPEAKER_06]: Because obviously it is going to happen.

796
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:46,124
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, have CDs gone obsolete yet?

797
00:51:46,264 --> 00:51:47,144
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not yet.

798
00:51:47,164 --> 00:51:49,565
[SPEAKER_01]: They've had unexpected longevity somehow.

799
00:51:49,885 --> 00:51:53,866
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been punched and kicked and throttled and had their hair pulled.

800
00:51:53,986 --> 00:51:54,386
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty much.

801
00:51:54,406 --> 00:51:55,766
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're not dead yet.

802
00:51:56,327 --> 00:51:57,547
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not dead yet.

803
00:51:57,647 --> 00:51:59,607
[SPEAKER_01]: CDs are... They're not getting better, though.

804
00:51:59,988 --> 00:52:05,489
[SPEAKER_01]: CDs are kind of where, right now, I think you can kind of look to that to see a little bit about where gaming's going.

805
00:52:06,029 --> 00:52:07,250
[SPEAKER_12]: Here's my parallel.

806
00:52:07,790 --> 00:52:08,890
[SPEAKER_12]: Newspapers and online...

807
00:52:09,270 --> 00:52:14,554
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, newspaper circulation is down so far, so fast.

808
00:52:14,874 --> 00:52:16,295
[SPEAKER_06]: Newsweek is up for sale.

809
00:52:16,456 --> 00:52:17,616
[SPEAKER_04]: But they're not all dead yet.

810
00:52:17,656 --> 00:52:18,657
[SPEAKER_06]: No, they're not all dead yet.

811
00:52:18,737 --> 00:52:23,060
[SPEAKER_06]: Major dailies are hurting, like the Washington Post, the New York Times, but they're not gone.

812
00:52:23,621 --> 00:52:24,982
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll see what form they take.

813
00:52:25,042 --> 00:52:28,645
[SPEAKER_06]: The iPad might have something to say about what form they take in the future.

814
00:52:29,425 --> 00:52:30,326
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see how that goes.

815
00:52:30,406 --> 00:52:32,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Or the Amazon Kindle.

816
00:52:32,387 --> 00:52:33,808
[SPEAKER_04]: The Kindle, yes.

817
00:52:34,269 --> 00:52:36,070
[SPEAKER_06]: And also Sony has another e-reader.

818
00:52:36,110 --> 00:52:36,851
[SPEAKER_06]: I forgot what it was called.

819
00:52:36,871 --> 00:52:38,512
[SPEAKER_12]: Sony's e-reader is actually really, really nice.

820
00:52:38,652 --> 00:52:41,195
[SPEAKER_06]: I have the Kindle app on my iPhone and I absolutely love it.

821
00:52:41,215 --> 00:52:44,779
[SPEAKER_12]: And keep in mind, I'm trying to go into publication for my field when I'm out of school.

822
00:52:59,568 --> 00:53:04,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Thankfully, there's jobs out there for online publication as well as print publications.

823
00:53:05,051 --> 00:53:06,252
[SPEAKER_06]: Besides just blogging.

824
00:53:06,432 --> 00:53:09,814
[SPEAKER_02]: If you know how to do them both, you're in a good place.

825
00:53:12,876 --> 00:53:17,799
[SPEAKER_03]: I've thankfully been printed before.

826
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:23,963
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate to do this, but I have actually breaking news, a special report we have to go to.

827
00:53:27,332 --> 00:53:27,935
Thanks for watching!

828
00:53:31,562 --> 00:53:33,843
[SPEAKER_01]: Live late breaking news, you guys.

829
00:53:33,903 --> 00:53:35,624
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very important.

830
00:53:35,664 --> 00:53:38,266
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just been a post on Facebook.

831
00:53:38,986 --> 00:53:40,867
[SPEAKER_01]: Joshua Hunter was born at 5.14 p.m.

832
00:53:40,907 --> 00:53:44,970
[SPEAKER_01]: So congratulations to Loki.

833
00:53:45,010 --> 00:53:46,511
[SPEAKER_06]: And there was much rejoicing.

834
00:53:48,132 --> 00:53:53,355
[SPEAKER_04]: And I actually think I just saw something in the Orange Lounge from Kitsune.

835
00:53:53,375 --> 00:53:56,176
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's how I knew to look.

836
00:53:57,177 --> 00:53:59,538
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they're able to refresh a little faster.

837
00:53:59,658 --> 00:54:00,439
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so cute!

838
00:54:01,159 --> 00:54:01,740
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, right?

839
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:04,161
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at that little one!

840
00:54:04,201 --> 00:54:08,904
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, she couldn't have waited one more hour to have the baby during OLR.

841
00:54:08,924 --> 00:54:10,766
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's a Bobby Blackwolf baby.

842
00:54:10,906 --> 00:54:12,747
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, babies wait for no one.

843
00:54:14,088 --> 00:54:15,389
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure Nelly's like, get this child out of me.

844
00:54:20,117 --> 00:54:20,637
[SPEAKER_01]: There it is.

845
00:54:20,717 --> 00:54:22,999
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my impression of Nellie in childbirth.

846
00:54:23,319 --> 00:54:25,601
[SPEAKER_01]: The baby kind of looks like Nellie.

847
00:54:26,221 --> 00:54:27,602
[SPEAKER_01]: He does?

848
00:54:27,802 --> 00:54:28,202
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

849
00:54:28,222 --> 00:54:31,985
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he's got, though, you see that turn of his mouth?

850
00:54:32,165 --> 00:54:32,445
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

851
00:54:32,785 --> 00:54:34,226
[SPEAKER_02]: That's totally Loki.

852
00:54:34,266 --> 00:54:35,407
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you can definitely see.

853
00:54:36,188 --> 00:54:37,508
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he's got Nellie's nose.

854
00:54:38,629 --> 00:54:39,290
[SPEAKER_01]: So there you go.

855
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:40,130
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

856
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:44,033
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry to interrupt the show, but that was definitely worth interrupting the show for.

857
00:54:44,073 --> 00:54:46,574
[SPEAKER_12]: I wonder if they're going to have a brist for him, and then I feel really sorry.

858
00:54:46,594 --> 00:54:47,495
[SPEAKER_12]: Aww.

859
00:54:48,596 --> 00:54:48,716
[SPEAKER_12]: Aww.

860
00:54:49,056 --> 00:54:50,998
[SPEAKER_06]: Final Fantasy VII Victory Dance.

861
00:54:51,038 --> 00:54:51,879
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, that brings back memories.

862
00:54:51,899 --> 00:54:52,159
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.

863
00:54:52,439 --> 00:54:54,582
[SPEAKER_01]: I should have found that music.

864
00:54:54,882 --> 00:54:55,182
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

865
00:54:56,043 --> 00:54:59,727
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, any more baby news we get during the show we'll bring to you, okay?

866
00:54:59,747 --> 00:55:00,087
[SPEAKER_01]: Yay.

867
00:55:00,107 --> 00:55:00,387
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

868
00:55:00,648 --> 00:55:02,409
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, he's so pretty.

869
00:55:02,489 --> 00:55:03,230
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's got red hair.

870
00:55:03,571 --> 00:55:05,653
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we're just glad that StarCraft didn't lay an egg.

871
00:55:06,013 --> 00:55:06,153
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh!

872
00:55:06,253 --> 00:55:07,635
[SPEAKER_04]: Ouch.

873
00:55:08,495 --> 00:55:10,217
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's my... Yeah.

874
00:55:10,257 --> 00:55:10,818
[SPEAKER_01]: Too soon.

875
00:55:11,138 --> 00:55:11,438
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

876
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:14,542
[SPEAKER_01]: Moving on.

877
00:55:15,523 --> 00:55:16,324
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's my rim shot?

878
00:55:16,484 --> 00:55:16,744
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.

879
00:55:16,924 --> 00:55:19,207
[SPEAKER_01]: Drew Nami's like, how long before he's eating super bacon?

880
00:55:19,267 --> 00:55:20,448
[SPEAKER_01]: Too soon, you guys.

881
00:55:20,568 --> 00:55:21,229
[SPEAKER_01]: Good God.

882
00:55:21,730 --> 00:55:23,231
[SPEAKER_01]: Be happy for 24 hours.

883
00:55:23,352 --> 00:55:23,592
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

884
00:55:25,858 --> 00:55:26,699
[SPEAKER_01]: Actdeft has a point there.

885
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:28,781
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the first OLR baby.

886
00:55:29,421 --> 00:55:32,544
[SPEAKER_02]: I gave a congratulations to his sperm and Nelly's hard work.

887
00:55:33,225 --> 00:55:37,688
[SPEAKER_01]: Loki and Nelly were only dating when this show started.

888
00:55:37,768 --> 00:55:39,890
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously, who did all the work?

889
00:55:39,950 --> 00:55:40,931
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not saying you're wrong.

890
00:55:40,971 --> 00:55:41,872
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not saying you're wrong.

891
00:55:42,312 --> 00:55:43,934
[SPEAKER_06]: I said you got your priorities straight.

892
00:55:43,954 --> 00:55:49,058
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a comedian I like called Henry Cho who's a Korean guy from Tennessee, so he sounds totally Tennessee-y.

893
00:55:49,278 --> 00:55:49,678
[SPEAKER_01]: StarCraft 2

894
00:56:19,116 --> 00:56:19,260
Ah...

895
00:56:20,396 --> 00:56:28,800
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that is supposedly, I guess, coming to StarCraft 2 in the future, I guess it was supposed to be there when it launched, but it didn't make it, is chat rooms.

896
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:29,980
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.

897
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:31,801
[SPEAKER_01]: You were supposed to have chat rooms in StarCraft 2.

898
00:56:32,041 --> 00:56:39,684
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not there yet, but it's going to be added in a later patch, and that is per a forum post from one of the community managers over at Blizzard.

899
00:56:40,164 --> 00:56:46,367
[SPEAKER_01]: The chat room is going to be, quote, based around groups where you will be able to join public channels that are based around your interests.

900
00:56:46,787 --> 00:56:48,008
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds like it's going to be like AOL.

901
00:56:49,349 --> 00:56:49,889
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay!

902
00:56:51,149 --> 00:56:52,210
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that a good thing?

903
00:56:52,810 --> 00:56:53,550
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think so.

904
00:56:54,050 --> 00:57:03,312
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be private chat rooms as well if you are so inclined or you could always use real ID if you don't mind your last name being plastered all over the internet.

905
00:57:03,332 --> 00:57:05,412
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is why I use an alias.

906
00:57:06,553 --> 00:57:10,974
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried but Blizzard just kind of took it right off my credit card and was like, oh hey, this must be your name.

907
00:57:14,494 --> 00:57:16,655
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyhow, that's in the future for StarCraft 2.

908
00:57:16,695 --> 00:57:17,815
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, what do you got for us?

909
00:57:18,342 --> 00:57:18,802
[SPEAKER_05]: Baby.

910
00:57:19,683 --> 00:57:21,543
[SPEAKER_01]: He's obsessed.

911
00:57:21,903 --> 00:57:22,644
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, everybody.

912
00:57:22,664 --> 00:57:23,544
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see you next week.

913
00:57:23,864 --> 00:57:25,665
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no, no, no, no.

914
00:57:26,825 --> 00:57:29,606
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the biological bomb started ticking really hardcore.

915
00:57:29,906 --> 00:57:30,166
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

916
00:57:31,667 --> 00:57:33,207
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you feel a Twitter in your... Twitter.

917
00:57:34,368 --> 00:57:36,028
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you feel a Twitter in your uterus?

918
00:57:36,909 --> 00:57:39,750
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I was actually thinking of Kathy Griffin, so was it a Twitter in the twat?

919
00:57:41,792 --> 00:57:42,473
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, too soon.

920
00:57:43,033 --> 00:57:43,273
[SPEAKER_06]: Ouch.

921
00:57:43,593 --> 00:57:44,774
[SPEAKER_06]: Where is that rim shot?

922
00:57:45,715 --> 00:57:46,815
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob's got the sad trombone.

923
00:57:47,556 --> 00:57:47,936
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no.

924
00:57:48,076 --> 00:57:48,636
[SPEAKER_04]: I got it right here.

925
00:57:48,796 --> 00:57:51,978
[SPEAKER_04]: What, keep going?

926
00:57:53,059 --> 00:58:09,148
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, remember we were talking a while back about the R4 being banned, being that that's the little memory card reader thing for the Nintendo DS so that you could play ROMs or copies of games or bootleg games.

927
00:58:09,688 --> 00:58:38,761
[SPEAKER_02]: um so there has well I've got a ninja pass so I'm going to talk but anyway um I really got it for though all my imports it's not mine officer I swear but anyway anyway um they actually um there's been a released uh you know they were banned in the UK and now there's a bit more information that's put out about it they basically said that it was actually related to a number of different devices that were sold by Playable's

928
00:58:39,681 --> 00:58:44,025
[SPEAKER_02]: which is the company that they banned was Playables Limited.

929
00:58:45,626 --> 00:58:54,913
[SPEAKER_02]: The devices are defined, and this is a quote, enabled Nintendo DS users to play unlawful copies of Nintendo DS games with which they have downloaded using the internet.

930
00:58:54,993 --> 00:58:58,636
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what Nintendo means about game copiers.

931
00:58:59,896 --> 00:59:12,742
[SPEAKER_02]: But the things that really make it illegal, and this is actually on the list are the R4DS, M3DS, DS1 Supercard, DSTT, DS Linker, Ace Card, CycloDS, Evolution, N5, and EZ Devices.

932
00:59:13,002 --> 00:59:13,942
[SPEAKER_02]: You didn't mention the Ninja Pass.

933
00:59:13,962 --> 00:59:14,903
[SPEAKER_01]: So all the fun stuff.

934
00:59:15,023 --> 00:59:16,543
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't mention the Ninja Pass, so I'm cool.

935
00:59:16,643 --> 00:59:18,064
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they always make the good stuff illegal.

936
00:59:18,704 --> 00:59:43,941
[SPEAKER_02]: but all of these are ones that use the micro SD flashcard and the argument though basically Nintendo's claim was that it was in violation of the Copyright Designs and Patents Act of 1998 in the UK and the argument that Playables put up was basically that it was to play homebrew games

937
00:59:44,815 --> 00:59:59,177
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, but basically the whole big thing is that the device circumvents Nintendo's machine you know, any of the programming built into it that's there on purpose um

938
01:00:01,428 --> 01:00:18,383
[SPEAKER_02]: And so basically, all of these things, the different encryptions, different things that Nintendo built into the hardware to protect from being able to use bootlegs and whatnot, the device is supposed to counteract them, so that's a big thing that Nintendo's got a bug up their butt about.

939
01:00:20,884 --> 01:00:48,137
[SPEAKER_02]: and according to Nintendo they've seized more than 165,000 game copiers that were intended for playables and so basically they're just you know that was the whole deal about it that even though yeah there's a bunch of other cool things you can do with them the whole bless you the whole big thing has to do with circumventing their hard work

940
01:00:50,389 --> 01:00:54,793
[SPEAKER_01]: I get that and all, but doesn't this seem a little throwing out the baby with the bathwater to you?

941
01:00:55,473 --> 01:00:56,194
[SPEAKER_01]: No pun intended.

942
01:00:56,934 --> 01:01:06,563
[SPEAKER_01]: Because this is where they're saying that since you can use this device to pirate games, it shouldn't be out there on the market.

943
01:01:06,623 --> 01:01:08,664
[SPEAKER_01]: But I can use my computer to pirate games.

944
01:01:08,704 --> 01:01:10,066
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that mean my computer should be banned?

945
01:01:10,086 --> 01:01:10,126
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

946
01:01:11,949 --> 01:01:14,410
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's more about what you use it for.

947
01:01:14,470 --> 01:01:17,691
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, the good thing about the R4 is that it does open it up to homebrew.

948
01:01:18,331 --> 01:01:20,532
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, of course, I can see both sides of it.

949
01:01:20,832 --> 01:01:27,295
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of people that can sit there and go, okay, you know damn well there's plenty of people that buy those R4s that aren't using it for homebrew.

950
01:01:27,335 --> 01:01:29,016
[SPEAKER_01]: They are using it for the malicious purpose.

951
01:01:29,356 --> 01:01:29,876
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's tough.

952
01:01:29,916 --> 01:01:31,116
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, where do you draw the line?

953
01:01:31,797 --> 01:01:32,157
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

954
01:01:33,777 --> 01:01:39,460
[SPEAKER_04]: So... That's a tough call because, you know, it's... With the gaming community, you know...

955
01:01:41,312 --> 01:01:59,619
[SPEAKER_04]: That kind of stuff is really, you know, it's hard to call because, you know, you got the regular, you know, honest gamers who actually buy their stuff and, you know, they don't get, you know, access to this because, you know, just a bunch of people decided, oh, we're gonna steal games.

956
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:07,286
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not fair to both the legitimate players as well as the guys who are doing the stuff.

957
01:02:07,686 --> 01:02:08,888
[SPEAKER_04]: Either way, it's a bad deal.

958
01:02:09,809 --> 01:02:23,022
[SPEAKER_01]: You see, if Nintendo would open up the DS to homebrew, not that I see them ever doing that, but if they were to do something like that, this cart wouldn't really have a lot of leg to stand on because its only purpose would be for something shady.

959
01:02:24,222 --> 01:02:24,683
[SPEAKER_01]: I get it.

960
01:02:24,883 --> 01:02:29,926
[SPEAKER_01]: Nintendo doesn't want to open that up because then there's going to be all sorts of scary homebrew things.

961
01:02:30,006 --> 01:02:35,229
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there would be homebrew to play Sony PS1 games on your DS or something like that.

962
01:02:35,249 --> 01:02:35,729
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?

963
01:02:35,970 --> 01:02:37,831
[SPEAKER_01]: Which would just be horrible.

964
01:02:37,931 --> 01:02:40,192
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, right?

965
01:02:40,332 --> 01:02:45,275
[SPEAKER_01]: How many people originally bought a PSP to play the NES emulator that was out at the time?

966
01:02:45,996 --> 01:02:46,756
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't buy one.

967
01:02:47,797 --> 01:02:49,098
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's another thing.

968
01:02:49,278 --> 01:02:52,960
[SPEAKER_04]: Games that strictly come out for the PSP like Dissidia

969
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:53,400
Yay!

970
01:02:53,420 --> 01:02:53,560
Yay!

971
01:02:53,620 --> 01:02:53,981
Yay!

972
01:03:15,454 --> 01:03:16,355
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just ridiculous.

973
01:03:16,975 --> 01:03:21,359
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's part of the reason why I didn't play Kingdom Hearts Chain of Memories is because I didn't own a DS.

974
01:03:21,379 --> 01:03:27,583
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but at the same time, emulators, especially to play current games, are super duper illegal and just as bad as what they're banning.

975
01:03:27,943 --> 01:03:31,906
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, at least know what it is.

976
01:03:31,966 --> 01:03:36,709
[SPEAKER_02]: At least with the R4 and those devices, they are contingent on you having the system.

977
01:03:38,631 --> 01:03:38,811
[SPEAKER_01]: True.

978
01:03:39,271 --> 01:03:39,431
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

979
01:03:40,132 --> 01:03:40,332
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

980
01:03:40,785 --> 01:03:42,708
[SPEAKER_01]: Was there more you wanted to say there, Jamie?

981
01:03:43,028 --> 01:03:54,283
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it was just quoting other cases in Europe that had to do with reel-to-reel tape copiers, but said that this was far worse because it did actually go right on the edge of copyright infringement.

982
01:03:54,793 --> 01:04:01,579
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, well, look, if you want something for free, here's something new that's going to be for free that doesn't involve questionable legality things.

983
01:04:01,599 --> 01:04:02,921
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a totally legit thing.

984
01:04:03,601 --> 01:04:06,424
[SPEAKER_01]: EverQuest 2 is soon going to have a free model.

985
01:04:06,604 --> 01:04:06,804
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

986
01:04:07,125 --> 01:04:10,488
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, EverQuest 2 is getting EverQuest 2 Extended.

987
01:04:10,888 --> 01:04:11,809
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, here's the thing, though.

988
01:04:11,849 --> 01:04:15,913
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not like when Lords of the Rings opened up.

989
01:04:16,093 --> 01:04:17,615
[SPEAKER_01]: No, D&D opened up to free-to-play.

990
01:04:17,635 --> 01:04:17,875
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm.

991
01:04:18,135 --> 01:04:18,795
[SPEAKER_01]: DDO Opened Up and Went Free

992
01:04:40,442 --> 01:04:42,044
[SPEAKER_01]: EverQuest 2 Extended

993
01:05:00,161 --> 01:05:03,102
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting because they show all these different types of plans.

994
01:05:03,442 --> 01:05:05,663
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get a free plan for bronze.

995
01:05:05,803 --> 01:05:07,164
[SPEAKER_01]: What they call the bronze level is free.

996
01:05:07,444 --> 01:05:16,287
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a silver plan that's a $10 one-time purchase that gets you more character slots, more spells opened up, you get more bag slots and so forth, more...

997
01:05:21,789 --> 01:05:22,429
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

998
01:05:46,878 --> 01:05:47,779
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting tactic.

999
01:05:48,019 --> 01:05:55,504
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if there'll be a lot of platinum and gold players on there, because I think they would be all in regular EverQuest, but I bet you'll get a lot of bronze and maybe even some silvers.

1000
01:05:55,904 --> 01:05:58,726
[SPEAKER_06]: And that isn't going to cross over with the regular EverQuest, too.

1001
01:05:58,826 --> 01:06:00,247
[SPEAKER_06]: That's going to be its own separate thing.

1002
01:06:00,727 --> 01:06:01,848
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what they're saying now.

1003
01:06:02,208 --> 01:06:07,472
[SPEAKER_01]: But my curiosity is, well, then what if one population starts to really off-balance the other?

1004
01:06:07,572 --> 01:06:09,653
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a possibility they might merge them later on?

1005
01:06:10,373 --> 01:06:36,144
[SPEAKER_01]: I was reading on this thing about if you've already got an existing subscription for EverQuest then you basically get a gold account okay that's what I figured is that if you're already paying them 15 bucks a month that's probably what the regular ones are paying them interesting though that not only have they launched and maybe this is the unreported part of the story is that not only have they launched a free but they've also launched a pay us more version with that platinum tier

1006
01:06:36,864 --> 01:06:39,945
[SPEAKER_06]: is it more expensive than the regular games monthly subscription?

1007
01:06:39,965 --> 01:06:55,111
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the regular games monthly is the same as that gold $15 a month at least that's like the average MMO subscription but $200 a year I mean that's not as terrible as it sounds because you have to divide $200 by 12 so it's about what maybe $18 a month so it's not terrible

1008
01:06:56,731 --> 01:07:16,581
[SPEAKER_04]: um you know how you were saying with the the going to free to play um I when I actually had the power on my computer to do it um I used to play this game uh Cartoon Network's Fusion Fall don't knock it till you tried it um it's we're big fans of uh um robot unicorn attack here so yeah

1009
01:07:16,801 --> 01:07:32,088
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so the Cartoon Network Universe MMO, originally when it first came out, you would have the future levels, which was like about five sections of the world and a couple of quests and things like that.

1010
01:07:32,128 --> 01:07:37,891
[SPEAKER_04]: And then in order to go to the past was a whole new world, was a totally expanded world.

1011
01:07:38,692 --> 01:07:40,893
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was like 15 a month.

1012
01:07:41,633 --> 01:07:45,155
[SPEAKER_04]: And now I think it was back in April, they went completely free to play.

1013
01:07:46,136 --> 01:08:04,795
[SPEAKER_04]: and they literally skyrocketed their membership because it finally went free to play because a lot of us who really enjoyed the game were pissed that most of the game cost you money because me being a poor gamer.

1014
01:08:06,076 --> 01:08:08,699
[SPEAKER_03]: I am totally against paying any sort of money for a game.

1015
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:10,180
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, within $10.

1016
01:08:10,220 --> 01:08:14,624
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's a lot of people listening that are probably in the same boat you are.

1017
01:08:15,145 --> 01:08:22,612
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a shout-out coming here from Giovedea in our chatroom at chat.orangelandredi.com Fusion Fall is amazing.

1018
01:08:23,213 --> 01:08:27,497
[SPEAKER_01]: VidPower in our chatroom says those old Cartoon Network Toonami Flash games were great.

1019
01:08:27,897 --> 01:08:29,799
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkTetsuya is saying Adult Swim needs an MMO.

1020
01:08:30,820 --> 01:08:59,601
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah, well, FusionFall is close enough to an Adult Swim MMO because the graphics of the game really remind me of this wonderful artist called Bleedman who's on DeviantArt and look him up, he's awesome it's like making the cartoony, you know like Dexter, not so cartoony, like he actually has a body and hands and arms what a concept so very cool DarkSakura, what do you got next for us?

1021
01:09:00,236 --> 01:09:04,599
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we have some other stuff for fans of Force Unleashed.

1022
01:09:05,079 --> 01:09:10,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Force Unleashed 2 has been in development, except the executive producer quit.

1023
01:09:11,463 --> 01:09:11,844
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no.

1024
01:09:13,144 --> 01:09:19,989
[SPEAKER_02]: Hayden Blackman resigned from LucasArts after being with them for 13 years, and he just said it was time to go.

1025
01:09:21,470 --> 01:09:23,911
[SPEAKER_01]: He was like, I am not putting Jar Jar Binks in my game.

1026
01:09:24,252 --> 01:09:24,592
[SPEAKER_01]: F you.

1027
01:09:24,612 --> 01:09:24,712
[SPEAKER_01]: F you.

1028
01:09:25,427 --> 01:09:53,652
[SPEAKER_02]: well as a quote while the decision to leave LucasArts did not happen overnight or come easily I really feel that now is the best time for me to move on and explore new creative challenges and look forward to the next phase of my career meaning god I hate this place I want to quit I know like totally reading through the lines there's huge drama that went down that you're never going to know about and LucasArts is saying that his departure is not going to affect the game's development at all yeah

1029
01:09:53,937 --> 01:09:55,558
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh no, it won't affect quality at all.

1030
01:09:56,118 --> 01:09:56,278
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1031
01:09:56,939 --> 01:09:57,679
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you never know.

1032
01:09:57,719 --> 01:10:00,460
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I know we're sitting here kind of poking fun, but it could get better.

1033
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:01,041
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows?

1034
01:10:01,361 --> 01:10:03,702
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, you know, LucasArts left the dry.

1035
01:10:04,182 --> 01:10:10,345
[SPEAKER_02]: We are extremely grateful for his many contributions, fully support him in his new endeavors, and wish him all the best in the future.

1036
01:10:10,646 --> 01:10:17,209
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we're a company in California, and you're not allowed to say really anything bad about your previous employees, including the reasons why they left.

1037
01:10:19,212 --> 01:10:29,311
[SPEAKER_01]: by the way, I had a friend that worked at LucasArts and she totally got me in the Skywalker Ranch didn't you have George Lucas walk right by and you said something about you wanted to fling your sandwich at him?

1038
01:10:29,491 --> 01:10:31,916
[SPEAKER_12]: I was in meatless flicking distance of George Lucas

1039
01:10:32,898 --> 01:10:34,019
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard this story on the show before.

1040
01:10:34,039 --> 01:10:34,779
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanted my money back.

1041
01:10:34,959 --> 01:10:36,420
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank God for your self-restraint.

1042
01:10:37,460 --> 01:10:38,120
[SPEAKER_06]: What a concept.

1043
01:11:05,133 --> 01:11:21,160
[SPEAKER_01]: I think one of the new things people will be excited about too is how we're going to be able to penalize people who are habitually quitting out of games, which isn't exactly cheating, but it creates a really negative experience for everybody else in the game.

1044
01:11:21,519 --> 01:11:22,980
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're going to penalize rage quitting?

1045
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:23,400
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1046
01:11:23,580 --> 01:11:23,901
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

1047
01:11:24,801 --> 01:11:32,226
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually have new tools now to detect that, and eventually people who do this habitually will actually be penalized.

1048
01:11:32,747 --> 01:11:39,111
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to be able to remove them from the population so they can't make everyone else keep having a bad time.

1049
01:11:39,671 --> 01:11:51,359
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, of course, they don't elaborate on what exactly they're doing, but doesn't that sound to me like if you rage quit too much, you're going to get banished to Rage Quit Island, where you will play with nothing but other rage quitters?

1050
01:11:51,759 --> 01:11:52,861
[SPEAKER_12]: and not be allowed to rage quit.

1051
01:11:53,942 --> 01:11:55,665
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds kind of amazing actually.

1052
01:11:56,069 --> 01:11:57,370
[SPEAKER_12]: They should make them do Battle Royale.

1053
01:11:57,650 --> 01:11:58,151
[SPEAKER_12]: For real.

1054
01:11:59,052 --> 01:12:03,395
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, okay, they say they're going to be able to tell the difference between a rage quit and a disconnect.

1055
01:12:03,415 --> 01:12:04,196
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let me tell you this.

1056
01:12:04,236 --> 01:12:08,019
[SPEAKER_01]: In Final Fantasy XI, my version of rage quit was to go turn off the cable modem.

1057
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:15,145
[SPEAKER_01]: So how would they know that that was... How did they know that that's me rage quitting and not a disconnect?

1058
01:12:15,225 --> 01:12:23,853
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, I get backing out of a match and all that or quitting or whatever, but how do they know the difference between that and a legitimate drop of the connection?

1059
01:12:24,113 --> 01:12:26,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know those wonderful ninja mods.

1060
01:12:26,614 --> 01:12:27,555
[SPEAKER_04]: You never know where they are.

1061
01:12:28,655 --> 01:12:30,516
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it could be the timing of it, too.

1062
01:12:30,556 --> 01:12:38,380
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, if you are habitually always quitting when certain circumstances met, then that's when you get banished to Rage Quit Island or something.

1063
01:12:38,420 --> 01:12:47,864
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, if you're down and you always seem to lose your connection one minute before the match is over, you're probably going to get targeted for exile, is my thought.

1064
01:12:48,243 --> 01:12:48,784
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1065
01:13:03,403 --> 01:13:03,943
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, let's see.

1066
01:13:04,063 --> 01:13:08,046
[SPEAKER_01]: Tigerclaw says maybe someone with high pings lagging out and disconnecting.

1067
01:13:08,186 --> 01:13:11,787
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah, maybe kind of seeing like, oh, the pings suddenly get slower and slower.

1068
01:13:11,848 --> 01:13:16,350
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a legitimate disconnect where somebody who just had a really good connection and suddenly, oh, it's gone.

1069
01:13:16,830 --> 01:13:17,530
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe a little less.

1070
01:13:17,891 --> 01:13:20,832
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be very curious to see how this all plays out.

1071
01:13:21,533 --> 01:13:22,653
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm.

1072
01:13:22,853 --> 01:13:23,694
[SPEAKER_01]: How they're going to treat that.

1073
01:13:23,714 --> 01:13:29,437
[SPEAKER_01]: But I love the idea of making all the rage quitters play together on their own little island where they can all rage quit and, you know...

1074
01:13:30,157 --> 01:13:30,537
[SPEAKER_01]: Go F themselves.

1075
01:13:30,557 --> 01:13:32,579
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like trapping a bunch of trolls on a single island.

1076
01:13:32,599 --> 01:13:34,040
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

1077
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:41,184
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the idea of Xbox Live being like the continent of awesome people and then trolls banished to their own island.

1078
01:13:41,244 --> 01:13:41,885
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds great to me.

1079
01:13:41,905 --> 01:13:44,746
[SPEAKER_02]: If they're trolls they need to be banished to their own bridge.

1080
01:13:45,847 --> 01:13:46,548
[SPEAKER_01]: To go live under?

1081
01:13:46,888 --> 01:13:48,709
[SPEAKER_06]: As long as the bridge doesn't connect to anything.

1082
01:13:48,829 --> 01:13:49,890
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure, I'm all for that.

1083
01:13:51,243 --> 01:13:51,463
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura

1084
01:14:05,718 --> 01:14:08,100
[SPEAKER_02]: My hand is broken!

1085
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:09,361
[SPEAKER_01]: Use your good hand.

1086
01:14:10,622 --> 01:14:11,423
[SPEAKER_01]: God gave you two.

1087
01:14:11,743 --> 01:14:12,944
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to go take some more Vicodin.

1088
01:14:14,345 --> 01:14:16,887
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, anyway, Valve made a whoops.

1089
01:14:18,008 --> 01:14:24,714
[SPEAKER_02]: They banned 12,000 legitimate Modern Warfare 2 players.

1090
01:14:26,035 --> 01:14:33,021
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, the software that's in Steamworks to get the cheaters

1091
01:14:34,141 --> 01:14:41,843
[SPEAKER_02]: went on an extermination rampage and banned 12,000 players over the last two weeks.

1092
01:14:43,023 --> 01:14:57,027
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically what happened is that, and this is a quote from the email that was sent out by Gabe Newell, who's the Valve president, the problem was that Steam would fail a signature check between the disk version of a DLL and a latent memory version.

1093
01:14:58,347 --> 01:15:01,869
[SPEAKER_02]: So, basically, they said, you know, our bad, sorry.

1094
01:15:02,229 --> 01:15:02,570
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoops.

1095
01:15:03,150 --> 01:15:04,191
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that he used angst.

1096
01:15:04,271 --> 01:15:06,672
[SPEAKER_02]: I apologize for any frustration or angst that may have caused you.

1097
01:15:07,513 --> 01:15:10,056
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you all turn your caps lock off now?

1098
01:15:10,316 --> 01:15:10,777
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, right?

1099
01:15:11,377 --> 01:15:22,588
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's also promised a giftable copy of Left 4 Dead 2 to all of those affected, as well as a copy for themselves.

1100
01:15:23,449 --> 01:15:28,053
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I get accidentally banned from a Steam game, I'm going to get two free copies of a game.

1101
01:15:28,974 --> 01:15:29,755
[SPEAKER_02]: One is giftable.

1102
01:15:30,365 --> 01:15:32,787
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, that's basically two free copies, right?

1103
01:15:32,867 --> 01:15:34,568
[SPEAKER_01]: One for you and one for someone you really like.

1104
01:15:34,728 --> 01:15:38,450
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so hey, any of you that's been affected by this, gimme!

1105
01:15:39,711 --> 01:15:40,071
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?

1106
01:15:40,131 --> 01:15:41,292
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of where I'm at, too.

1107
01:15:41,332 --> 01:15:44,474
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, you know, I have Left 4 Dead 1, but not 2.

1108
01:15:45,194 --> 01:15:59,022
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think why they're giving Left 4 Dead 2 out is because, you know, when you get banned from a game like Modern Warfare 2, you know, the only compensation you can get is to go around killing a bunch of zombies is compensation, you know?

1109
01:15:59,363 --> 01:15:59,823
Yeah.

1110
01:15:59,983 --> 01:16:01,883
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a fair trade.

1111
01:16:02,083 --> 01:16:03,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Playing a big hairy biker.

1112
01:16:03,644 --> 01:16:04,104
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

1113
01:16:04,324 --> 01:16:11,065
[SPEAKER_01]: Besides the also obvious part that it's also their game, you know, it is Valve's game, it's kind of one that they can give away.

1114
01:16:11,585 --> 01:16:21,027
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually is kind of impressive that they instead didn't go, oh, well, whoops, we'll give you a copy of, what's cheaper, Left 4 Dead 1, you know, or something.

1115
01:16:21,427 --> 01:16:22,848
[SPEAKER_02]: Magical Unicorn Fart.

1116
01:16:22,988 --> 01:16:23,608
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.

1117
01:16:23,628 --> 01:16:25,228
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't think that was a Valve game.

1118
01:16:26,388 --> 01:16:28,209
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have a free copy of Alien Swarm.

1119
01:16:29,029 --> 01:16:29,149
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh.

1120
01:16:31,555 --> 01:16:38,175
[SPEAKER_03]: Alien Swarm Oh wait, everybody's getting that free So, have we talked already about the wonderfulness that is Portal 2?

1121
01:16:39,574 --> 01:16:40,515
[SPEAKER_01]: on this show we have.

1122
01:16:40,855 --> 01:16:44,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you watch all the tech demonstrations?

1123
01:16:45,660 --> 01:16:46,241
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, right?

1124
01:16:47,202 --> 01:16:48,363
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the slippery thing.

1125
01:16:49,064 --> 01:16:49,564
[SPEAKER_04]: The what?

1126
01:16:49,865 --> 01:16:50,665
[SPEAKER_02]: The slippery goo?

1127
01:16:50,966 --> 01:16:51,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, the goo.

1128
01:16:52,007 --> 01:16:52,447
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the goo.

1129
01:16:52,467 --> 01:16:53,168
[SPEAKER_04]: And the bouncy goo?

1130
01:16:53,509 --> 01:16:54,129
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the bouncy goo.

1131
01:16:54,390 --> 01:16:55,310
[SPEAKER_04]: That was so great.

1132
01:16:55,531 --> 01:16:59,535
[SPEAKER_04]: I was very much pleased with the entire concept of Portal.

1133
01:17:02,038 --> 01:17:05,242
[SPEAKER_04]: The fact that they changed the... Oh, and I died.

1134
01:17:05,462 --> 01:17:06,603
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh well.

1135
01:17:06,643 --> 01:17:07,665
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you still playing RuneScape?

1136
01:17:07,685 --> 01:17:08,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I'm still playing RuneScape.

1137
01:17:09,066 --> 01:17:09,988
[SPEAKER_04]: The zombie just killed me.

1138
01:17:10,028 --> 01:17:12,531
[SPEAKER_01]: You're worse than Loki in Magic Robot Unicorn.

1139
01:17:12,671 --> 01:17:13,892
[SPEAKER_04]: He plays Magic Robot Unicorn.

1140
01:17:13,932 --> 01:17:15,514
[SPEAKER_01]: He denies that he does it too, but he does.

1141
01:17:17,132 --> 01:17:25,358
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, the only grief I kind of have is the fact that they're theoretically using the same protagonist, but she looks nothing like the original game.

1142
01:17:25,978 --> 01:17:26,859
[SPEAKER_04]: Did they put a picture of her?

1143
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:28,320
[SPEAKER_00]: Of Chell?

1144
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:30,442
[SPEAKER_04]: They did, but they didn't.

1145
01:17:30,622 --> 01:17:32,523
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't seen the picture of her.

1146
01:17:32,864 --> 01:17:37,127
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I saw the one that was in Game Informer, the different one they had.

1147
01:17:37,147 --> 01:17:42,251
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know she's also supposed to be, the actual person is supposed to be showing up in Half-Life 3.

1148
01:17:42,911 --> 01:17:46,154
[SPEAKER_01]: We also might have set off an LOL, Accidental False Alarm, in chat.

1149
01:17:46,454 --> 01:17:48,135
[SPEAKER_01]: Thamster says, wait, is that out now?

1150
01:17:48,356 --> 01:17:49,316
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no, no, it's not.

1151
01:17:49,396 --> 01:17:51,058
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1152
01:17:51,098 --> 01:17:51,778
[SPEAKER_01]: Not until 2011.

1153
01:17:51,858 --> 01:17:52,459
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no.

1154
01:17:53,300 --> 01:17:53,560
[SPEAKER_01]: Nope.

1155
01:17:53,940 --> 01:17:56,382
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are some sexy demos on YouTube if you want to go check it out.

1156
01:17:56,602 --> 01:17:57,423
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yes.

1157
01:17:57,443 --> 01:18:01,086
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go to release dates, travel around the world, and talk about games that are going to be coming out.

1158
01:18:01,446 --> 01:18:04,547
[SPEAKER_01]: Portal 2 will not be on the list this week, but maybe some other stuff.

1159
01:18:04,967 --> 01:18:06,327
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to start with the U.S.

1160
01:18:06,367 --> 01:18:06,627
[SPEAKER_01]: tonight.

1161
01:18:06,647 --> 01:18:09,128
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to shake things up a little bit because obviously Loki's not here.

1162
01:18:09,148 --> 01:18:09,928
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to cover U.S.

1163
01:18:09,968 --> 01:18:13,289
[SPEAKER_01]: tonight and pronounce things correctly for once, I hope.

1164
01:18:13,869 --> 01:18:15,930
[SPEAKER_01]: Monster Rancher DS is out this week.

1165
01:18:16,010 --> 01:18:18,210
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to cost you $30 if you want that on the DS.

1166
01:18:18,790 --> 01:18:20,191
[SPEAKER_01]: Sing it, family hits.

1167
01:18:20,691 --> 01:18:27,472
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right, because you know you want to sing songs from Beauty and the Beast and The Little Mermaid, all from Disney, coming out on the PlayStation 3 and the Wii this week.

1168
01:18:30,373 --> 01:18:31,495
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what's interesting though?

1169
01:18:32,216 --> 01:18:33,637
[SPEAKER_01]: The PS3 one is cheaper.

1170
01:18:33,838 --> 01:18:35,480
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, because the Wii one comes with a mic.

1171
01:18:35,660 --> 01:18:37,282
[SPEAKER_01]: I get it.

1172
01:18:37,362 --> 01:18:40,446
[SPEAKER_01]: Gary, I know this is going to be the one that gets you back into console games.

1173
01:18:40,466 --> 01:18:40,767
[SPEAKER_01]: You ready?

1174
01:18:41,167 --> 01:18:42,269
[SPEAKER_01]: Dora the Explorer.

1175
01:18:42,349 --> 01:18:44,291
[SPEAKER_01]: Dora's Big Birthday Adventure on the DS.

1176
01:18:44,512 --> 01:18:45,393
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, whatever.

1177
01:18:45,413 --> 01:18:45,793
[SPEAKER_01]: 30 bucks.

1178
01:18:47,255 --> 01:18:48,235
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh no.

1179
01:18:48,295 --> 01:18:50,437
[SPEAKER_06]: If I were to get another console, I'd get a PS3.

1180
01:18:51,778 --> 01:18:55,520
[SPEAKER_01]: Junior Classic Books and Fairy Tales, $20 on the Nintendo DS.

1181
01:18:55,540 --> 01:19:01,285
[SPEAKER_01]: This is basically, you're paying for $130 that are pretty much in the public domain, or were really cheap to license.

1182
01:19:01,365 --> 01:19:02,946
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you want that, hey, have fun with it.

1183
01:19:03,546 --> 01:19:08,590
[SPEAKER_01]: So, quite a barrage of some more wireless controllers and accessories also out this week.

1184
01:19:09,270 --> 01:19:12,733
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we might have hit on most of the games...

1185
01:19:13,473 --> 01:19:16,394
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's kind of a slow week in game release world.

1186
01:19:16,434 --> 01:19:18,455
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to see if there's anything else this week.

1187
01:19:19,576 --> 01:19:22,957
[SPEAKER_04]: They got anything good in the budget bin?

1188
01:19:23,617 --> 01:19:25,818
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this new game on the Xbox 360 is only $30.

1189
01:19:26,638 --> 01:19:29,620
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a role-playing game, and for an Xbox 360 game, that's something.

1190
01:19:30,020 --> 01:19:32,621
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Agarest War, and it comes out on the 5th.

1191
01:19:33,490 --> 01:19:35,032
[SPEAKER_06]: Record of Argorist War

1192
01:19:59,094 --> 01:19:59,974
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I have for the U.S.

1193
01:19:59,994 --> 01:20:00,315
[SPEAKER_01]: this week.

1194
01:20:00,635 --> 01:20:01,596
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, like I said, the U.K.

1195
01:20:01,616 --> 01:20:02,717
[SPEAKER_02]: is looking pretty bare.

1196
01:20:03,037 --> 01:20:05,119
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing until next week, so I'm going to do Japan.

1197
01:20:05,639 --> 01:20:06,300
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay!

1198
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:08,902
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry to take your pronunciation away from you, Rob.

1199
01:20:10,283 --> 01:20:10,864
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really fine.

1200
01:20:11,064 --> 01:20:13,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Put all that anime pronunciation skill to the test.

1201
01:20:14,252 --> 01:20:19,157
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we've got a few things that don't really particularly have a date on it, but they're for PC and Mac.

1202
01:20:19,177 --> 01:20:27,185
[SPEAKER_02]: We have Arma 2, Operation Arrowhead, Battle vs. Chess, City of Heroes Going Rogue, Elemental War of Magic, Cannon Lynch 2, Mafia 2.

1203
01:20:28,807 --> 01:20:29,527
[SPEAKER_02]: Going to...

1204
01:20:31,369 --> 01:20:31,969
[SPEAKER_02]: The PSP.

1205
01:20:33,350 --> 01:20:38,171
[SPEAKER_02]: There's Assassin's Creed Bloodlines from Ubi the Best, so it's basically re-released.

1206
01:20:38,611 --> 01:20:42,892
[SPEAKER_02]: There's Hayarikami 3, which is another re-release.

1207
01:20:42,952 --> 01:20:47,253
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Oretachi no Sabage Versus, which is a new game.

1208
01:20:51,094 --> 01:20:56,157
[SPEAKER_02]: Also coming out on the Nintendo DS, we have Battle Spirits Digital Starter.

1209
01:20:56,337 --> 01:20:58,118
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a game that I totally want to play.

1210
01:20:58,699 --> 01:21:01,860
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Chokowai Hanashi DS Aonosho.

1211
01:21:02,561 --> 01:21:05,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Which, it means like super scary stories.

1212
01:21:06,783 --> 01:21:07,944
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all ghost tales.

1213
01:21:08,364 --> 01:21:08,804
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what they are.

1214
01:21:10,165 --> 01:21:14,008
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also we have Heartcatch Precure Oshare Collection.

1215
01:21:14,328 --> 01:21:16,409
[SPEAKER_02]: So, there's also Jewel Pet.

1216
01:21:16,749 --> 01:21:19,251
[SPEAKER_02]: Mahono Oheade Isho ni Aboso.

1217
01:21:20,171 --> 01:21:20,531
[SPEAKER_02]: No, sorry.

1218
01:21:21,752 --> 01:21:22,292
[SPEAKER_02]: Asobo.

1219
01:21:22,413 --> 01:21:23,313
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I said that wrong.

1220
01:21:23,353 --> 01:21:23,994
[SPEAKER_02]: Asobo.

1221
01:21:24,134 --> 01:21:24,494
[SPEAKER_02]: Asobo.

1222
01:21:24,614 --> 01:21:24,934
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, good.

1223
01:21:24,954 --> 01:21:25,595
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just me.

1224
01:21:26,335 --> 01:21:27,416
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, I just read too fast.

1225
01:21:27,876 --> 01:21:29,977
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have Mame Goma Kawaii Gaipai.

1226
01:21:29,997 --> 01:21:32,599
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no, I'm thinking opai.

1227
01:21:32,659 --> 01:21:33,340
[SPEAKER_02]: Opai means boobs.

1228
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:36,942
[SPEAKER_02]: Tetris Party Premium also on August 5th.

1229
01:21:37,202 --> 01:21:38,802
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait, there's a game about boobs coming out?

1230
01:21:38,862 --> 01:21:42,803
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's Ippai, and I thought I was thinking Oppai, which is boobs.

1231
01:21:44,023 --> 01:21:54,525
[SPEAKER_02]: PlayStation 2, we have J-League winning 11 2010 Club Championship, and Persona 3 FES, which is a PlayStation the best to re-release.

1232
01:21:54,866 --> 01:21:57,086
[SPEAKER_02]: Persona 4, also PlayStation 2 the best.

1233
01:21:57,886 --> 01:22:01,607
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Shin Sango Musou 4 Empires, which is also a re-release.

1234
01:22:02,187 --> 01:22:04,347
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, Madden NFL 11 is also on the list.

1235
01:22:05,108 --> 01:22:06,348
[SPEAKER_02]: The Persona games were really good.

1236
01:22:06,368 --> 01:22:06,928
[SPEAKER_02]: I really liked them.

1237
01:22:07,048 --> 01:22:12,855
[SPEAKER_01]: Believe it or not, we have sports fans that listen to the show who want their roster update for the year, just like DDR fans want their song list.

1238
01:22:12,875 --> 01:22:14,998
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm wondering who in Japan likes American football.

1239
01:22:15,018 --> 01:22:19,363
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, on the way, we have Tetris Party Premium and Twinkle Queen.

1240
01:22:20,084 --> 01:22:21,385
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, Arcade Shooter.

1241
01:22:21,405 --> 01:22:22,266
[SPEAKER_01]: Twinkle Queen?

1242
01:22:22,426 --> 01:22:22,987
[SPEAKER_02]: Twinkle Queen.

1243
01:22:23,027 --> 01:22:23,688
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me look this up.

1244
01:22:23,928 --> 01:22:25,969
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I met a drag queen like that once

1245
01:22:40,543 --> 01:22:41,624
[SPEAKER_01]: Been there, done that.

1246
01:22:41,704 --> 01:22:44,326
[SPEAKER_01]: How many all-chick fighting games have we seen at this point?

1247
01:22:45,807 --> 01:22:47,788
[SPEAKER_01]: They are not going to sleep with you when you beat the game.

1248
01:22:48,628 --> 01:22:56,033
[SPEAKER_02]: A few undated things that I just think is funny is Gunblade New York and LA Machine Guns Arcade Pack, which I would totally get.

1249
01:22:56,493 --> 01:22:57,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Love you, Sega.

1250
01:22:58,615 --> 01:23:00,276
[SPEAKER_02]: Cold Gym Dance Workout.

1251
01:23:01,657 --> 01:23:02,197
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1252
01:23:02,717 --> 01:23:03,238
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, right?

1253
01:23:03,678 --> 01:23:06,220
[SPEAKER_02]: And Lucha Libre AAA Heroes Del Ring.

1254
01:23:08,566 --> 01:23:10,735
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the one they were plugging at E3.

1255
01:23:11,116 --> 01:23:12,341
[SPEAKER_02]: And Disney Guilty Party.

1256
01:23:14,382 --> 01:23:17,063
[SPEAKER_01]: I know what game that is, but that's just a funny way of phrasing it.

1257
01:23:17,083 --> 01:23:17,703
[SPEAKER_06]: I love the name.

1258
01:23:17,743 --> 01:23:19,123
[SPEAKER_06]: Disney Guilty Party?

1259
01:23:19,183 --> 01:23:20,844
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's guilty of stealing the cookies?

1260
01:23:20,864 --> 01:23:21,664
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that like Clue?

1261
01:23:22,404 --> 01:23:23,324
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind is.

1262
01:23:23,344 --> 01:23:24,224
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a whodunit game.

1263
01:23:24,244 --> 01:23:25,205
[SPEAKER_01]: Disney characters?

1264
01:23:25,805 --> 01:23:28,105
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like an original Disney game.

1265
01:23:28,145 --> 01:23:30,926
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like Ariel and Beauty and the Beast and stuff.

1266
01:23:31,526 --> 01:23:38,828
[SPEAKER_04]: The only Disney game that I'm actually looking forward to that they were plugging in E3 really, really bad was Epic Mickey.

1267
01:23:39,088 --> 01:23:39,928
[SPEAKER_04]: That looks amazing.

1268
01:23:40,248 --> 01:23:53,158
[SPEAKER_01]: Epic Mickey does look epic, but I gotta give a shout-out to Tron, because I don't stand for movies very often, but I will be there day one, Tron 3D, and I'm gonna have the biggest fanboy boner in the galaxy.

1269
01:23:54,759 --> 01:23:55,780
[SPEAKER_06]: Gamers unite!

1270
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:57,741
[SPEAKER_06]: Gamers unite!

1271
01:23:57,882 --> 01:24:01,504
[SPEAKER_06]: Then you know they're gonna sell so many tie-in games with that, it's gonna be ridiculous.

1272
01:24:01,825 --> 01:24:02,805
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's a good movie.

1273
01:24:02,825 --> 01:24:04,427
[SPEAKER_02]: God, I hope it's a good movie.

1274
01:24:05,367 --> 01:24:05,507
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1275
01:24:06,448 --> 01:24:08,471
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, back to the Japanese list.

1276
01:24:08,731 --> 01:24:13,136
[SPEAKER_02]: PlayStation 3, Assassin's Creed 2 Special Edition, and Tiger Woods PGA Tour 11.

1277
01:24:14,338 --> 01:24:14,638
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?

1278
01:24:15,759 --> 01:24:22,908
[SPEAKER_02]: And then finally for Xbox 360, we have Assassin's Creed 2 Special Edition Platinum Collection, and Magna Carta 2, which I know is pretty big.

1279
01:24:23,228 --> 01:24:24,189
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a Platinum Collection.

1280
01:24:24,750 --> 01:24:25,511
[SPEAKER_02]: And that would be all.

1281
01:24:26,091 --> 01:24:26,632
[SPEAKER_04]: That's everything.

1282
01:24:27,092 --> 01:24:29,834
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of those were budget bin games or re-releases, which I really like.

1283
01:24:29,874 --> 01:24:31,155
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Magna Carta 2 is a re-release.

1284
01:24:31,215 --> 01:24:34,278
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Japan seems to be doing a lot of price reductions this time of year.

1285
01:24:34,618 --> 01:24:37,620
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't know what the occasion is, but hey, I'll take any excuse.

1286
01:24:37,841 --> 01:24:42,644
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so will I. Somebody's got some serious rage against Mickey on the chat room.

1287
01:24:43,565 --> 01:24:44,847
[SPEAKER_01]: That would actually be Drew Nami.

1288
01:24:45,307 --> 01:24:49,172
[SPEAKER_01]: Some folks in our chat room are asking, where is, where was it here?

1289
01:24:49,212 --> 01:24:50,113
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going back to our chat room.

1290
01:24:50,133 --> 01:24:53,897
[SPEAKER_01]: Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com, and I think the whole Twinkle Queen brought this up.

1291
01:24:54,558 --> 01:24:57,261
[SPEAKER_01]: Frisbee's asking, where the fuck is the RuPaul's Drag Race game?

1292
01:24:57,621 --> 01:24:58,162
I think we should.

1293
01:24:58,602 --> 01:24:58,742
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

1294
01:24:58,762 --> 01:24:58,942
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

1295
01:25:21,612 --> 01:25:23,316
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, come on, chat room.

1296
01:25:23,536 --> 01:25:24,739
[SPEAKER_01]: Which would you rather play?

1297
01:25:25,140 --> 01:25:28,268
[SPEAKER_01]: The Bachelor or RuPaul's Drag Race?

1298
01:25:29,271 --> 01:25:29,631
[SPEAKER_01]: RuPaul.

1299
01:25:31,375 --> 01:25:40,598
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, even you guys who have no interest in drag whatsoever, completely secure in your masculinity and your love of women, I think you would play RuPaul's Drag Race versus The Bachelor.

1300
01:25:41,018 --> 01:25:41,998
[SPEAKER_06]: And why do you say this?

1301
01:25:42,578 --> 01:25:43,499
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it's awesome!

1302
01:25:43,579 --> 01:25:46,480
[SPEAKER_01]: Because The Bachelor is gayer than RuPaul's Drag Race.

1303
01:25:46,500 --> 01:25:47,180
[SPEAKER_01]: It really is.

1304
01:25:47,460 --> 01:25:48,500
[SPEAKER_06]: I won't argue with that.

1305
01:25:48,640 --> 01:25:49,200
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

1306
01:25:49,381 --> 01:25:50,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, this is my thing.

1307
01:25:52,321 --> 01:25:55,802
[SPEAKER_02]: When I see my husband spend hours customizing wrestling characters...

1308
01:25:57,904 --> 01:25:58,806
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they're dress-up dolls?

1309
01:25:58,846 --> 01:25:59,568
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Barbie, yeah.

1310
01:25:59,809 --> 01:26:00,691
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Barbie for men.

1311
01:26:00,771 --> 01:26:02,395
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, yeah, men really like to do this too.

1312
01:26:02,856 --> 01:26:04,580
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, wrestling is just soap opera for men.

1313
01:26:05,472 --> 01:26:06,792
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing wrong with that.

1314
01:26:06,832 --> 01:26:08,673
[SPEAKER_01]: Men need their stories told.

1315
01:26:08,773 --> 01:26:10,753
[SPEAKER_01]: I loved it.

1316
01:26:11,013 --> 01:26:17,555
[SPEAKER_04]: And speaking of the whole rage-quitting thing for Halo, I just rage-created RuneScape because I was sick of dying.

1317
01:26:17,575 --> 01:26:19,355
[SPEAKER_04]: I died twice.

1318
01:26:19,375 --> 01:26:21,716
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to get banished to Rage Quit Island.

1319
01:26:21,896 --> 01:26:27,137
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, actually, don't get me started on the fact that I started the game day one in RuneScape.

1320
01:26:27,617 --> 01:26:29,979
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, how to fend for myself.

1321
01:26:30,379 --> 01:26:32,760
[SPEAKER_04]: Had to learn how to use all my skills on my own.

1322
01:26:33,181 --> 01:26:37,323
[SPEAKER_04]: Then about, you know, two years after I started playing, they introduced Noob Island.

1323
01:26:38,244 --> 01:26:38,444
[SPEAKER_04]: Oy!

1324
01:26:39,425 --> 01:26:39,905
[SPEAKER_04]: Noob Island.

1325
01:26:40,085 --> 01:26:42,086
[SPEAKER_01]: They basically show you... There really is a place called Noob Island.

1326
01:26:42,206 --> 01:26:42,667
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1327
01:26:42,747 --> 01:26:45,609
[SPEAKER_04]: They basically show you how to get to fifth level.

1328
01:26:46,109 --> 01:26:52,013
[SPEAKER_04]: They walk you through it tutorial style on how to craft... Does a little hand come out of the monitor?

1329
01:26:52,153 --> 01:26:52,493
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

1330
01:26:52,513 --> 01:26:52,933
[SPEAKER_01]: Come with me.

1331
01:26:52,973 --> 01:26:56,616
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like that stupid Milo thing they were showing at E3 last year.

1332
01:26:56,656 --> 01:26:56,836
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1333
01:26:57,136 --> 01:26:58,277
[SPEAKER_04]: Come with me!

1334
01:26:58,437 --> 01:27:00,559
[SPEAKER_04]: They were probably losing too many new people.

1335
01:27:00,779 --> 01:27:03,641
[SPEAKER_04]: It reminded me of that annoying paperclip guy on Word.

1336
01:27:04,562 --> 01:27:06,283
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh god, it was turning the thing off.

1337
01:27:06,403 --> 01:27:08,004
[SPEAKER_05]: I just got a pepper in my wound.

1338
01:27:08,405 --> 01:27:13,809
[SPEAKER_01]: Every Word computer I ever log into for the first time, I'm always like, okay, first things first.

1339
01:27:13,869 --> 01:27:14,709
[SPEAKER_01]: Launch Word.

1340
01:27:14,729 --> 01:27:16,050
[SPEAKER_01]: Right click, disable.

1341
01:27:16,491 --> 01:27:18,793
[SPEAKER_06]: Kill the paperclip!

1342
01:27:19,053 --> 01:27:21,415
[SPEAKER_06]: Or the wizard, or whatever form it happens to take.

1343
01:27:21,455 --> 01:27:23,076
[SPEAKER_06]: That thing is so bloody annoying.

1344
01:27:23,479 --> 01:27:25,100
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1345
01:27:51,756 --> 01:27:59,059
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, look, I'm all about whatever makes you happy, but at the same time, don't complain about your system being slow when you have Miss Kitty running around chasing yarn.

1346
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:05,202
[SPEAKER_02]: My word for the whole thing is, why?

1347
01:28:05,542 --> 01:28:07,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a question, just why?

1348
01:28:07,423 --> 01:28:11,265
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold on, Dark Tetsuya is making the Project Journey game for OLR, right?

1349
01:28:11,585 --> 01:28:15,227
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we have a level where Dark Sakura shoots paper clips?

1350
01:28:15,387 --> 01:28:16,487
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that would be appropriate.

1351
01:28:17,028 --> 01:28:17,248
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

1352
01:28:17,853 --> 01:28:19,395
[SPEAKER_01]: She can euthanize Mr. Paperclip.

1353
01:28:19,475 --> 01:28:19,995
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be great.

1354
01:28:20,756 --> 01:28:21,597
[SPEAKER_01]: Just making that request.

1355
01:28:21,617 --> 01:28:22,538
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not gory enough.

1356
01:28:22,558 --> 01:28:24,200
[SPEAKER_06]: That guy needs to die horribly.

1357
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:28,164
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, then a paperclip can just attack her hand if she loses.

1358
01:28:28,184 --> 01:28:30,827
[SPEAKER_12]: The giant paperclip, but when you shoot him, he bleeds kittens.

1359
01:28:31,708 --> 01:28:32,388
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

1360
01:28:32,869 --> 01:28:38,395
[SPEAKER_06]: I was thinking just Mr. Paperclip could melt into slag slowly and painfully, but okay, fine.

1361
01:28:41,175 --> 01:28:42,256
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, can I do a story?

1362
01:28:42,336 --> 01:28:42,816
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you may.

1363
01:28:44,217 --> 01:28:45,097
[SPEAKER_02]: Guess what?

1364
01:28:45,898 --> 01:28:47,879
[SPEAKER_02]: Disney acquired PlayDom.

1365
01:28:48,620 --> 01:28:49,420
[SPEAKER_01]: What does that mean?

1366
01:28:50,120 --> 01:28:52,262
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, PlayDom does sorority life, Rob.

1367
01:28:52,362 --> 01:28:57,405
[SPEAKER_01]: My favorite Facebook game.

1368
01:28:57,505 --> 01:29:03,769
[SPEAKER_01]: I seriously played sorority life religiously for like a month and then I got... Don't judge me!

1369
01:29:05,230 --> 01:29:06,331
[SPEAKER_08]: I see you judging him.

1370
01:29:06,652 --> 01:29:08,674
[SPEAKER_01]: You totally were just judging me right there.

1371
01:29:08,694 --> 01:29:09,435
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you see that look?

1372
01:29:09,455 --> 01:29:10,716
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the look of judgment.

1373
01:29:11,537 --> 01:29:11,817
[SPEAKER_03]: Chips.

1374
01:29:11,957 --> 01:29:12,458
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.

1375
01:29:13,599 --> 01:29:15,862
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to grab the chips because this is just entertaining now.

1376
01:29:17,003 --> 01:29:20,066
[SPEAKER_01]: I was playing, look, but do you know why I was playing sorority life?

1377
01:29:20,126 --> 01:29:24,271
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there was a dress up your character mode and I was the fiercest diva on the block.

1378
01:29:25,777 --> 01:29:26,197
[SPEAKER_01]: I was.

1379
01:29:26,638 --> 01:29:27,238
[SPEAKER_06]: I got nothing.

1380
01:29:27,258 --> 01:29:28,019
[SPEAKER_06]: I got nothing.

1381
01:29:28,219 --> 01:29:32,783
[SPEAKER_01]: And she would beat bitches down with her purse because that's what she did in sorority life.

1382
01:29:33,344 --> 01:29:35,566
[SPEAKER_01]: But here's what started frustrating me about sorority life.

1383
01:29:35,906 --> 01:29:44,134
[SPEAKER_01]: They implemented, and I cannot believe we are giving this any face time on the show, but I really want to reiterate this week, I don't give a fuck.

1384
01:29:44,654 --> 01:29:44,954
[SPEAKER_01]: All right?

1385
01:29:45,135 --> 01:29:45,335
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1386
01:29:45,395 --> 01:29:47,036
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, so sorority life.

1387
01:29:47,817 --> 01:29:49,058
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever floats your boat, man.

1388
01:29:49,939 --> 01:29:51,120
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever sinks your battleship.

1389
01:29:51,180 --> 01:29:51,741
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, that too.

1390
01:29:52,620 --> 01:30:18,949
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorority Life, yeah, I played it for like a month and I quit finally because I got really irritated that whenever you log in for some reason it would instantly put you up to the top of other people's list of who wants to beat down this bitch and so like I would log in and within three seconds I would be out of energy because I would basically get gang raped by all these blonde bitches the minute I log in so Sorority Life needed to give me at least like two minutes to bank my money or something

1391
01:30:19,429 --> 01:30:20,150
[SPEAKER_01]: But I didn't do that.

1392
01:30:20,450 --> 01:30:21,911
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's my complaint with sorority life.

1393
01:30:21,931 --> 01:30:24,892
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've totally wasted two minutes of your life that you're never going to get back.

1394
01:30:26,353 --> 01:30:26,994
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I keep going?

1395
01:30:27,114 --> 01:30:27,294
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1396
01:30:27,614 --> 01:30:33,437
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Playdom also has Social City and Market Street.

1397
01:30:33,497 --> 01:30:35,258
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are their other kind of big ones.

1398
01:30:35,799 --> 01:30:38,680
[SPEAKER_02]: But Disney acquired them.

1399
01:30:40,201 --> 01:30:41,862
[SPEAKER_02]: It now has sorority life.

1400
01:30:41,902 --> 01:30:44,684
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe we'll get Princess Sorority Life.

1401
01:30:45,549 --> 01:30:46,710
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that would bring me back.

1402
01:30:46,890 --> 01:30:47,530
[SPEAKER_02]: I would play that.

1403
01:30:47,911 --> 01:30:49,052
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, just real quick.

1404
01:30:49,072 --> 01:30:52,974
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to see Belle give everyone the smackdown because she's the brainy woman.

1405
01:30:53,255 --> 01:30:58,678
[SPEAKER_01]: Tiana being the new girl on the block is not old and aged like Belle so she will beat you all down.

1406
01:30:58,698 --> 01:31:02,081
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's Jasmine who probably has her whole... Jasmine will just whine.

1407
01:31:02,281 --> 01:31:04,843
[SPEAKER_02]: She'll just, you know, stick her tiger on people.

1408
01:31:07,128 --> 01:31:08,089
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to have a tiger!

1409
01:31:08,309 --> 01:31:09,750
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to be a princess with a tiger, Rob!

1410
01:31:10,070 --> 01:31:10,771
[SPEAKER_02]: Not with a frog.

1411
01:31:11,452 --> 01:31:13,233
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought you wanted a princess with a pony.

1412
01:31:13,553 --> 01:31:13,833
[SPEAKER_02]: No!

1413
01:31:14,054 --> 01:31:14,354
[SPEAKER_02]: Tiger!

1414
01:31:15,315 --> 01:31:15,855
[SPEAKER_04]: Or a goat.

1415
01:31:18,297 --> 01:31:26,583
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm officially decreeing the wah-wah sound to SSJ Matt for a Facebook game, getting FaceTime on the show.

1416
01:31:26,683 --> 01:31:27,444
[SPEAKER_04]: Who would have thunk it?

1417
01:31:27,504 --> 01:31:28,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, he gets the wah-wah sound.

1418
01:31:28,625 --> 01:31:30,406
[SPEAKER_04]: I see what you did there.

1419
01:31:31,327 --> 01:31:33,229
[SPEAKER_02]: I've bitched about how much I hate Farmville.

1420
01:31:34,189 --> 01:31:35,991
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh god, don't get me started.

1421
01:31:36,846 --> 01:31:40,129
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm playing Hotel City and I actually like it.

1422
01:31:40,169 --> 01:31:42,492
[SPEAKER_01]: You say that like it's supposed to make it better.

1423
01:31:42,632 --> 01:31:43,533
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's okay.

1424
01:31:44,963 --> 01:31:45,383
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, anyhow.

1425
01:31:46,104 --> 01:31:47,605
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, now how about a real game?

1426
01:31:48,266 --> 01:31:48,806
[SPEAKER_01]: I like this.

1427
01:31:48,906 --> 01:31:49,627
[SPEAKER_01]: This is awesome.

1428
01:31:50,027 --> 01:31:53,310
[SPEAKER_01]: This game is called, it's an old school game, Pango.

1429
01:31:53,970 --> 01:31:59,975
[SPEAKER_01]: Pango was, let me see if I can find some music from Pango because Pango was pretty epic back in the day.

1430
01:32:00,355 --> 01:32:06,420
[SPEAKER_01]: It was this game where you would play a penguin and you walked around a maze and you could push ice blocks.

1431
01:32:06,440 --> 01:32:07,341
[SPEAKER_12]: It's freaking hard too.

1432
01:32:08,102 --> 01:32:09,043
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a lot of fun.

1433
01:32:09,103 --> 01:32:11,484
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember what it's inspired by but let's see.

1434
01:32:11,525 --> 01:32:11,925
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a

1435
01:32:15,154 --> 01:32:15,874
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I'm a pango.

1436
01:32:23,578 --> 01:32:26,559
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, then you push these little ice blocks around and smush the guys in the stage.

1437
01:32:26,620 --> 01:32:27,200
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot of fun.

1438
01:32:27,400 --> 01:32:27,760
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cute.

1439
01:32:28,040 --> 01:32:29,961
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks like Pac-Man with a penguin.

1440
01:32:30,982 --> 01:32:31,962
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's no dots either.

1441
01:32:32,102 --> 01:32:33,863
[SPEAKER_06]: What are those green things trying to chase you?

1442
01:32:34,003 --> 01:32:35,444
[SPEAKER_01]: The green things are, I guess, trying to eat you.

1443
01:32:35,484 --> 01:32:35,784
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

1444
01:32:37,578 --> 01:32:43,764
[SPEAKER_05]: We recognize the music too That became later on I know, I've heard it before What other game was it in?

1445
01:32:43,824 --> 01:32:55,634
[SPEAKER_01]: DDR Raver's Choice Oh wow Anyway, that's not the point The point is, it's coming out on the PSP Yay

1446
01:32:56,875 --> 01:32:57,976
[SPEAKER_01]: No, wait, no, I take that back.

1447
01:32:58,036 --> 01:33:01,538
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually... I'm sorry, no, this is something completely different.

1448
01:33:01,579 --> 01:33:01,939
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.

1449
01:33:01,959 --> 01:33:03,740
[SPEAKER_01]: It looked like a PSP screenshot at first.

1450
01:33:03,780 --> 01:33:04,981
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually an arcade game.

1451
01:33:06,062 --> 01:33:09,204
[SPEAKER_01]: It's coming out in arcades in Japan.

1452
01:33:09,265 --> 01:33:11,186
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be an eight-player version.

1453
01:33:11,706 --> 01:33:14,328
[SPEAKER_01]: Eight-player simultaneous penguins running around the screen.

1454
01:33:15,309 --> 01:33:16,710
[SPEAKER_01]: No graphical upgrade at all.

1455
01:33:17,691 --> 01:33:18,412
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course not!

1456
01:33:18,432 --> 01:33:18,832
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course not!

1457
01:33:18,852 --> 01:33:19,153
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course not!

1458
01:33:19,173 --> 01:33:19,673
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course not!

1459
01:33:44,620 --> 01:33:47,962
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, now, speaking of classic games Wait, wait, speaking of Sega What?

1460
01:33:48,202 --> 01:34:01,549
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to enlist the aid of the chatroom because I used to know the name of this game and for the life of me I forgot about it It's a Sega Saturn game that was visual, not visual, it was audio only and you grew seeds with it A.K.A.

1461
01:34:01,569 --> 01:34:02,690
[SPEAKER_02]: the game came with a packet of seeds

1462
01:34:04,324 --> 01:34:06,745
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura likes to dig through the gaming vault and find a game that she says, Hey!

1463
01:34:34,437 --> 01:34:39,140
[SPEAKER_01]: You little children, babies of the world, including the new one born tonight.

1464
01:34:39,640 --> 01:34:44,163
[SPEAKER_01]: Listen, babies, you should be schooled on these old games.

1465
01:34:44,203 --> 01:34:46,565
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was your age, I played these games.

1466
01:34:47,325 --> 01:34:48,066
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, DarkSakura?

1467
01:34:48,086 --> 01:34:48,826
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, Rob.

1468
01:34:48,846 --> 01:34:49,867
[SPEAKER_01]: You weren't really a baby.

1469
01:34:49,907 --> 01:34:52,429
[SPEAKER_01]: You were probably like 15 when this particular game came out.

1470
01:34:52,509 --> 01:34:53,649
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I wasn't.

1471
01:34:54,070 --> 01:34:54,530
[SPEAKER_01]: How old were you?

1472
01:34:55,451 --> 01:34:56,331
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have been 20.

1473
01:34:56,771 --> 01:34:57,912
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.

1474
01:34:58,152 --> 01:34:58,913
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, I take that back.

1475
01:34:58,933 --> 01:34:59,574
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have been 19.

1476
01:34:59,794 --> 01:35:03,016
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, well, enough talk about what age you would have been.

1477
01:35:03,056 --> 01:35:04,157
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about what the game is.

1478
01:35:04,197 --> 01:35:05,578
[SPEAKER_01]: What game did you pick for the folks tonight?

1479
01:35:05,958 --> 01:35:06,779
[SPEAKER_02]: Guardian Heroes.

1480
01:35:08,760 --> 01:35:09,501
[SPEAKER_02]: Guardian Heroes.

1481
01:35:11,082 --> 01:35:12,103
[SPEAKER_02]: If you will play the music, please.

1482
01:35:13,424 --> 01:35:14,404
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the character select.

1483
01:35:14,444 --> 01:35:14,605
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me...

1484
01:35:17,208 --> 01:35:18,548
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Saturn music.

1485
01:35:19,548 --> 01:35:24,549
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, yeah, the game came out on the Sega Saturn in 1996.

1486
01:35:25,569 --> 01:35:30,430
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, it was kind of funny because this came out before it did in Japan.

1487
01:35:30,530 --> 01:35:40,012
[SPEAKER_02]: It came out January 25th in America, January 26th in Japan, which I think might have actually, if I'm doing my, no, because then, I'm sorry.

1488
01:35:40,252 --> 01:35:45,133
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to think about, you know, across time zones if that would have been right, but no, I think Japan's a day ahead of us.

1489
01:35:45,700 --> 01:35:46,260
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

1490
01:36:04,785 --> 01:36:08,169
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a sequel that came out in 2004 for the Game Boy Advance.

1491
01:36:08,230 --> 01:36:09,531
[SPEAKER_02]: It was Advance Guardian Heroes.

1492
01:36:09,611 --> 01:36:16,259
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's sort of an RPG touch to the beat-em-up genre.

1493
01:36:17,060 --> 01:36:19,863
[SPEAKER_02]: As you can, those of us in here can tell on Rob's computer.

1494
01:36:19,923 --> 01:36:20,064
[SPEAKER_12]: Ooh!

1495
01:36:20,544 --> 01:36:21,045
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I like it.

1496
01:36:21,365 --> 01:36:22,025
[SPEAKER_04]: I very much like it.

1497
01:36:22,546 --> 01:36:25,348
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of got the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles feel.

1498
01:36:25,368 --> 01:36:26,730
[SPEAKER_06]: I was thinking Street Fighter 2.

1499
01:36:27,871 --> 01:36:28,892
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's not a fighting game.

1500
01:36:29,152 --> 01:36:29,672
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a beat-em-up.

1501
01:36:29,692 --> 01:36:34,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Sort of like how Final Fight and Double Dragon.

1502
01:36:34,657 --> 01:36:37,660
[SPEAKER_02]: Except this one has magic and swords.

1503
01:36:37,720 --> 01:36:38,781
[SPEAKER_02]: Magic and swords.

1504
01:36:38,821 --> 01:36:39,902
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's no blood.

1505
01:36:40,582 --> 01:36:47,108
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, going forward, it had a versus mode where you could pick up to six different characters individually.

1506
01:36:47,308 --> 01:36:48,850
[SPEAKER_02]: and compete with the main characters.

1507
01:36:48,890 --> 01:36:54,254
[SPEAKER_02]: You get unlockable monsters, bosses and civilians with a timed battle or to the death.

1508
01:36:55,115 --> 01:37:01,641
[SPEAKER_02]: You get experience points during each scene and you can customize your characters with six different attributes.

1509
01:37:01,681 --> 01:37:07,446
[SPEAKER_02]: You have strength, vitality, intelligence, mentality, agility and luck.

1510
01:37:08,987 --> 01:37:13,031
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually luck is good for the spell casters.

1511
01:37:13,573 --> 01:37:17,616
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, there is, of course, the story mode.

1512
01:37:17,876 --> 01:37:20,378
[SPEAKER_02]: You can actually take different paths along the story.

1513
01:37:20,758 --> 01:37:23,520
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've got different endings, different bosses, different levels.

1514
01:37:24,080 --> 01:37:28,563
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, basically it has a ton of replayability just because you can really keep going.

1515
01:37:28,823 --> 01:37:31,625
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, this is one thing that I know my husband loves about this.

1516
01:37:32,966 --> 01:37:36,148
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a path that will lead to gold and silver from Gunstar Heroes.

1517
01:37:37,689 --> 01:37:38,429
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's pretty cool.

1518
01:37:38,610 --> 01:37:40,271
[SPEAKER_02]: And keep in mind, this was put up by Treasure.

1519
01:37:41,417 --> 01:37:43,280
[SPEAKER_02]: So it gets the, oh my god, Treshar!

1520
01:37:43,740 --> 01:37:45,863
[SPEAKER_02]: Award too.

1521
01:37:47,285 --> 01:37:55,716
[SPEAKER_02]: And, of course, the gold and silver as the final boss uses the gem power like he did against our heroes.

1522
01:37:56,857 --> 01:38:02,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you really can, um, it has multiple levels in the game.

1523
01:38:03,341 --> 01:38:06,683
[SPEAKER_02]: You usually only have three planes of battle, the four, the mid, and the back.

1524
01:38:07,403 --> 01:38:09,565
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and you can switch them out in sequence.

1525
01:38:10,445 --> 01:38:10,785
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and...

1526
01:38:12,066 --> 01:38:14,828
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also the shoulder buttons that make you move back and forth.

1527
01:38:15,388 --> 01:38:17,369
[SPEAKER_02]: You also have evasive moves.

1528
01:38:18,249 --> 01:38:24,212
[SPEAKER_02]: And you also have, like, if you get surrounded, you can change your planes.

1529
01:38:24,893 --> 01:38:26,914
[SPEAKER_02]: You can move to the foreground or background and whatnot.

1530
01:38:27,774 --> 01:38:28,455
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's pretty cool.

1531
01:38:29,815 --> 01:38:36,619
[SPEAKER_02]: With the games, you have Samuel Han, who is just a physical powerhouse type of guy.

1532
01:38:36,639 --> 01:38:37,980
[SPEAKER_02]: You have Randy M. Green.

1533
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,321
[SPEAKER_02]: Who has some spells.

1534
01:38:42,861 --> 01:38:43,942
[SPEAKER_02]: Their elemental magic.

1535
01:38:44,542 --> 01:38:49,083
[SPEAKER_02]: Ginjiro Ibushi, who is more moving attacks.

1536
01:38:50,164 --> 01:38:52,504
[SPEAKER_02]: Nicole Neal, who has different magic.

1537
01:38:53,025 --> 01:38:57,526
[SPEAKER_02]: And Serena Corsair, who's supposed to be just a knight.

1538
01:38:57,666 --> 01:38:58,707
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty well-rounded.

1539
01:39:00,487 --> 01:39:02,348
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it's the big game.

1540
01:39:02,448 --> 01:39:02,568
[SPEAKER_02]: It's...

1541
01:39:05,064 --> 01:39:32,158
[SPEAKER_02]: and also good luck freaking finding it now in Japan it was common as dirt I mean super common in the US not so much because they really didn't release very many copies over here and of course we didn't they released plenty of advanced Guardian Heroes but the Saturn one in the US pretty hard to find and it's got really crappy Americanized artwork on the cover makes me kind of sick

1542
01:39:33,298 --> 01:39:36,823
[SPEAKER_02]: But apart from that, though, I mean, it's a pretty damn good game.

1543
01:39:37,503 --> 01:39:38,625
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll leave the cover in the chat room.

1544
01:39:39,446 --> 01:39:43,991
[SPEAKER_01]: There it is, folks, for the Sega Saturn, your classic game of the week, Guardian Heroes.

1545
01:39:44,932 --> 01:39:46,835
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of a neat little combination there.

1546
01:39:47,095 --> 01:39:48,517
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it when genres collide.

1547
01:39:49,878 --> 01:39:51,240
[SPEAKER_12]: And on top of that, it's treasure.

1548
01:39:52,563 --> 01:39:55,604
[SPEAKER_01]: is there a treasure game you haven't done at this point as a classic game of the week?

1549
01:39:55,624 --> 01:40:04,726
[SPEAKER_02]: we haven't done like Chameleon Twist or um so you guys can guess what will be done before well no I might have to eventually do that have I done Silhouette Mirage?

1550
01:40:05,387 --> 01:40:13,289
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I have done Silhouette Mirage you have to check the wiki I can't remember there's been over over 125 classic games of the week at this point crazy

1551
01:40:13,749 --> 01:40:14,009
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1552
01:40:14,450 --> 01:40:17,152
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyhow, we're going to go ahead and take a break.

1553
01:40:17,392 --> 01:40:18,013
[SPEAKER_01]: I have done it.

1554
01:40:18,433 --> 01:40:20,575
[SPEAKER_01]: There is plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio to come.

1555
01:40:20,595 --> 01:40:23,057
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to talk about Microsoft Connect in the next segment.

1556
01:40:23,397 --> 01:40:26,780
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to talk about Silent Hill and a new comic book apparently coming out.

1557
01:40:26,840 --> 01:40:29,802
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes, believe it or not, more Facebook games.

1558
01:40:29,902 --> 01:40:31,644
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to talk about Zynga tonight.

1559
01:40:31,964 --> 01:40:32,424
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.

1560
01:40:32,745 --> 01:40:33,145
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.

1561
01:40:33,305 --> 01:40:33,986
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't tune out.

1562
01:40:34,006 --> 01:40:34,886
[SPEAKER_01]: I promise you.

1563
01:40:35,807 --> 01:40:37,008
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be lol-tastic.

1564
01:40:37,428 --> 01:40:40,951
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll be back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1565
01:40:41,011 --> 01:40:41,692
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay tuned.

1566
01:40:47,930 --> 01:40:50,752
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello everybody and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

1567
01:40:50,772 --> 01:40:57,656
[SPEAKER_01]: We are taping live on this August 1st of 2010 here at Orange Lounge Radio headquarters live at allgames.com.

1568
01:40:58,137 --> 01:41:01,119
[SPEAKER_01]: And today is actually a very special day in OLR history.

1569
01:41:01,199 --> 01:41:06,662
[SPEAKER_01]: Loki is not here tonight because his baby boy was just born earlier this evening at about 5 o'clock.

1570
01:41:07,303 --> 01:41:10,465
[SPEAKER_01]: Joshua is the boy's name in case you were wondering and you didn't hear earlier in the show.

1571
01:41:11,085 --> 01:41:12,447
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna blast Yay

1572
01:41:32,605 --> 01:41:33,706
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm having an absolute blast.

1573
01:41:33,726 --> 01:41:34,427
[SPEAKER_01]: This is so much fun.

1574
01:41:34,547 --> 01:41:35,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I know why Drew comes.

1575
01:41:35,687 --> 01:41:37,008
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we're only halfway through.

1576
01:41:37,048 --> 01:41:37,669
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the best part.

1577
01:41:37,709 --> 01:41:40,110
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't even gotten to emails or tweets.

1578
01:41:40,170 --> 01:41:41,391
[SPEAKER_01]: We got Twitters to get to a little bit.

1579
01:41:41,411 --> 01:41:42,272
[SPEAKER_01]: But wait, there's more.

1580
01:41:42,292 --> 01:41:42,972
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait, there's more.

1581
01:41:43,012 --> 01:41:45,314
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, you only got about five more minutes to get Twitter topics in.

1582
01:41:45,414 --> 01:41:48,336
[SPEAKER_01]: I have not been able to do any plugs on Twitter tonight because I've been so busy.

1583
01:41:48,696 --> 01:41:50,778
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know if we're going to have anything waiting for us there, but I'll look.

1584
01:41:51,238 --> 01:41:52,459
[SPEAKER_12]: We have spam in French.

1585
01:41:53,359 --> 01:41:55,121
[SPEAKER_01]: We get spam in French all the time.

1586
01:41:55,181 --> 01:41:55,481
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.

1587
01:41:55,521 --> 01:41:56,822
[SPEAKER_12]: I was just laughing because I can read it.

1588
01:41:57,827 --> 01:41:59,388
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1589
01:42:23,497 --> 01:42:50,241
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess these are some rumors picked up it was on buy.com but the listing was since pulled I can tell you this though the rumblings around and people that I know and you know I got friends in low places and so forth Orange Lounge Radio wants to tell you guys this is true these are happening but I mean also that's kind of like telling you like rain will eventually fall from the sky next month of course there's going to be limited editions of these huge games shouldn't be a huge surprise

1590
01:42:50,641 --> 01:42:53,023
[SPEAKER_01]: Activision hasn't officially announced it yet, but they will.

1591
01:42:53,183 --> 01:42:55,724
[SPEAKER_01]: Prestige for $150, Hard Edition for $80.

1592
01:42:56,385 --> 01:42:57,485
[SPEAKER_01]: Couldn't tell you what's in those.

1593
01:42:58,446 --> 01:43:03,529
[SPEAKER_01]: Although we're hearing possibly something about maybe a little car.

1594
01:43:05,518 --> 01:43:07,159
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, take that with what you will.

1595
01:43:08,379 --> 01:43:10,160
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one that Activision will talk about.

1596
01:43:10,220 --> 01:43:13,121
[SPEAKER_01]: It is DJ Tiesto is actually joining DJ Hero 2.

1597
01:43:13,941 --> 01:43:18,823
[SPEAKER_01]: He's actually going to be in the game as a playable character and he's going to be doing two new mixes in the game.

1598
01:43:18,943 --> 01:43:20,424
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's kind of rad.

1599
01:43:20,564 --> 01:43:27,327
[SPEAKER_01]: No news yet as to exactly what he's doing, but there was a little video that was released.

1600
01:43:27,767 --> 01:43:29,788
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not sure what this video shows us.

1601
01:43:29,848 --> 01:43:33,049
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it just shows him in game and it might be like playing one of his mixes here.

1602
01:43:33,909 --> 01:43:36,170
[SPEAKER_01]: But they did release a little clip here from DJ Hero 2.

1603
01:43:39,152 --> 01:43:40,833
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to get a little more of it here in studio.

1604
01:43:41,013 --> 01:43:43,894
[SPEAKER_04]: The first one was really awesome.

1605
01:43:44,014 --> 01:43:46,215
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I love DJ Hero 1.

1606
01:43:46,436 --> 01:43:47,016
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a DJ.

1607
01:43:50,137 --> 01:43:51,758
[SPEAKER_12]: I play for so many people.

1608
01:43:52,058 --> 01:43:53,739
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm very lucky that I have that opportunity.

1609
01:43:53,759 --> 01:43:54,940
[SPEAKER_01]: Nah, I don't want to hear the whole interview.

1610
01:43:54,980 --> 01:43:56,921
[SPEAKER_01]: I was hoping to hear more of his music.

1611
01:43:56,941 --> 01:43:58,762
[SPEAKER_05]: Being part of the DJ Hero game is...

1612
01:43:59,515 --> 01:44:00,916
[SPEAKER_01]: He'll be in DJ Hero, hooray for him.

1613
01:44:01,396 --> 01:44:04,098
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, Kmart.

1614
01:44:04,138 --> 01:44:07,541
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, this is like three shows in a row we've actually had a Kmart story.

1615
01:44:07,641 --> 01:44:08,641
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't get this.

1616
01:44:09,102 --> 01:44:10,483
[SPEAKER_01]: When did Kmart become relevant?

1617
01:44:10,663 --> 01:44:11,363
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't understand.

1618
01:44:11,463 --> 01:44:12,484
[SPEAKER_01]: This is so weird.

1619
01:44:12,864 --> 01:44:18,728
[SPEAKER_01]: They've done the whole rebranding thing, so perhaps... Well, they're really trying to appeal to the gamers, and this is a pretty big one.

1620
01:44:18,748 --> 01:44:20,390
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a great way to appeal to gamers.

1621
01:44:20,790 --> 01:44:21,911
[SPEAKER_01]: Sell stuff cheap.

1622
01:44:22,671 --> 01:44:26,115
[SPEAKER_01]: The Wii console, down to $179.99 this week.

1623
01:44:26,295 --> 01:44:27,256
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

1624
01:44:27,376 --> 01:44:28,677
[SPEAKER_01]: A whole $20 off.

1625
01:44:29,178 --> 01:44:32,301
[SPEAKER_01]: But hey, that's 10% of the cost, so hard to complain about that.

1626
01:44:32,882 --> 01:44:36,666
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, the deal runs out tomorrow, so you better hurry up and get on that.

1627
01:44:36,986 --> 01:44:37,907
[SPEAKER_12]: Aw, damn.

1628
01:44:37,967 --> 01:44:39,249
[SPEAKER_12]: Came right around the corner from my house.

1629
01:44:39,349 --> 01:44:42,172
[SPEAKER_01]: Both the white and the black Wiis, just so you know.

1630
01:44:42,856 --> 01:44:44,438
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no money, no!

1631
01:44:44,458 --> 01:44:46,661
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, how about some other stuff?

1632
01:44:46,801 --> 01:44:47,342
[SPEAKER_01]: How about it?

1633
01:44:48,163 --> 01:44:49,345
[SPEAKER_02]: This makes me particularly happy.

1634
01:44:49,425 --> 01:44:52,769
[SPEAKER_02]: In Rock Band, we have Blondie.

1635
01:44:52,989 --> 01:44:54,111
[SPEAKER_01]: Yay!

1636
01:44:54,471 --> 01:44:58,056
[SPEAKER_01]: There's already a little Blondie in there, but I'm never going to say no to more Blondie.

1637
01:44:58,897 --> 01:45:02,159
[SPEAKER_02]: and also a group that I like, Family Force 5.

1638
01:45:04,001 --> 01:45:14,208
[SPEAKER_02]: So actually, with this upcoming pack that's going to be out on August 3rd, we have Rapture for Blondie, Jesus Freak DC Talk, whatever, The Perfect Crime No.

1639
01:45:14,228 --> 01:45:26,397
[SPEAKER_02]: 2, The Decemberists, I Only Want You, Eagles of Death Metal, Saturday Morning Eels, Love Addict Family Force 5, Sturm und Drang, KMFDM, and Bulletproof LaRue.

1640
01:45:28,442 --> 01:45:29,804
[SPEAKER_01]: Shut up, what, in Rock Band?

1641
01:45:29,984 --> 01:45:30,204
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm.

1642
01:45:30,325 --> 01:45:31,446
[SPEAKER_01]: We're getting Bulletproof?

1643
01:45:31,847 --> 01:45:32,067
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1644
01:45:32,127 --> 01:45:34,810
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that song, even though it's like way overplayed on the radio right now.

1645
01:45:34,830 --> 01:45:35,171
[SPEAKER_01]: Yay!

1646
01:45:35,231 --> 01:45:36,853
[SPEAKER_01]: I loved it like nine months ago.

1647
01:45:37,994 --> 01:45:38,255
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.

1648
01:45:38,315 --> 01:45:39,937
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm getting DC Talk, that's funny.

1649
01:45:41,630 --> 01:45:42,210
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, come on.

1650
01:45:42,571 --> 01:45:43,691
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's give them a break.

1651
01:45:43,992 --> 01:45:51,016
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, ESRB has Fatal Labyrinth, which was a Sega Genesis game.

1652
01:45:52,377 --> 01:46:02,583
[SPEAKER_02]: It's supposed to be set up on the PC downloads, but it's also going to be available for Wii for the Virtual Console and Mac, PS3, Xbox 360.

1653
01:46:04,614 --> 01:46:06,555
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in the Genesis collection thingy.

1654
01:46:06,575 --> 01:46:07,536
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't bother.

1655
01:46:07,756 --> 01:46:09,297
[SPEAKER_02]: In the Sonic Ultimate Genesis collection.

1656
01:46:09,357 --> 01:46:11,158
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, get the Sonic collection.

1657
01:46:11,198 --> 01:46:15,501
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great, but don't bother with a $5 standalone release when you can get that collection for $20.

1658
01:46:15,561 --> 01:46:16,001
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great.

1659
01:46:16,641 --> 01:46:18,422
[SPEAKER_02]: And you get tons of stuff right now.

1660
01:46:18,442 --> 01:46:19,703
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes it is worth it to pay more.

1661
01:46:19,843 --> 01:46:21,084
[SPEAKER_01]: And that game kind of blows.

1662
01:46:21,424 --> 01:46:28,148
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I hate to say it, but it's kind of like somebody decided to port... I don't know if you guys know Rogue, the old-ass game from years and years ago.

1663
01:46:28,428 --> 01:46:31,770
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody decided to port Rogue to the Sega Genesis, and that's kind of what you got.

1664
01:46:32,210 --> 01:46:33,031
[SPEAKER_01]: And Rogue is more fun.

1665
01:46:34,577 --> 01:46:55,429
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, um, now also in other news, um, there is a mandatory update for, um, PS3 FromWorth, uh, 3.41 So, um, it's gonna add in a You May Like section to the PlayStation Store And, really, that's about it There's nothing else But it's mandatory!

1666
01:46:55,629 --> 01:47:00,972
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like how Twitter now shows me people I ought to be following I don't give a crap Anyway

1667
01:47:01,969 --> 01:47:04,354
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, I'm like, a lot of these people I'm not following for a reason.

1668
01:47:04,615 --> 01:47:05,156
[SPEAKER_01]: Just so you know.

1669
01:47:06,639 --> 01:47:11,510
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, let's go to Twitter topics and visit the tweeter and see who's sending us messages.

1670
01:47:13,789 --> 01:47:14,410
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1671
01:47:33,192 --> 01:47:52,909
[SPEAKER_01]: and this is definitely one that I think is interesting that we did overlook and it comes from the International Business Times that he's actually linking us to China is actually pushing a real name system for online games and that starts today, August 1st you're going to have to register using your real name if you want to play an online game this is like real ID gone wrong, really wrong

1672
01:47:53,870 --> 01:47:55,251
[SPEAKER_01]: That comes from the Ministry of Culture.

1673
01:47:55,311 --> 01:47:56,992
[SPEAKER_01]: It was announced on June 22nd.

1674
01:47:57,512 --> 01:48:05,516
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's part of a nationwide campaign to improve management of the virtual gaming industry and protect the minor from unwholesome content.

1675
01:48:06,280 --> 01:48:08,981
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you do realize this is China, right?

1676
01:48:09,001 --> 01:48:09,962
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know, I know, it's different.

1677
01:48:10,002 --> 01:48:11,662
[SPEAKER_01]: It's obviously a lot different than Real ID.

1678
01:48:11,963 --> 01:48:18,946
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they have some serious issues with people not managing their time well on these MMOs, right?

1679
01:48:19,546 --> 01:48:20,366
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I don't know.

1680
01:48:20,406 --> 01:48:27,530
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, but then again, we have some people with issues not managing their time well in America as well, so it just seems to be a lot worse.

1681
01:48:27,590 --> 01:48:29,531
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the stories you hear are really, really scary over there.

1682
01:48:29,551 --> 01:48:31,352
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what they're talking about, Shifty Eye, Shifty Eye.

1683
01:48:33,093 --> 01:48:38,281
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyhow, how would you like it if they stepped in and said, hey, everybody's going to have to play online games with their real name.

1684
01:48:38,341 --> 01:48:39,062
[SPEAKER_01]: Do not want.

1685
01:48:39,763 --> 01:48:40,524
[SPEAKER_08]: Do not want.

1686
01:48:40,644 --> 01:48:41,465
[SPEAKER_01]: Good luck with that, China.

1687
01:48:42,133 --> 01:48:45,936
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, next up, though, speaking of China, how about Chinatown?

1688
01:48:46,557 --> 01:48:49,979
[SPEAKER_01]: Matt, SJ100Matt on Twitter actually wanted to link us to this.

1689
01:48:50,019 --> 01:48:52,882
[SPEAKER_01]: He kind of wanted to give a shout-out to one of his local arcades.

1690
01:48:52,902 --> 01:48:57,966
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard of this place, but I've never been, and he was very proud that Kotaku had featured it this week.

1691
01:48:58,006 --> 01:49:02,630
[SPEAKER_01]: As you know, they're one of the big boy gaming blogs, and so they feature stuff once in a while.

1692
01:49:03,290 --> 01:49:30,753
[SPEAKER_01]: and they are talking about the Chinatown Fair Video Arcade it is located on Mott Street in New York City's Chinatown apparently it is also this environment that LGBT youth can just kind of be themselves yeah I read about that kind of interesting that it's gaming and LGBT colliding although I thought it was really cool when I went to that place in Portland they had like an LGBT night once a month which I thought was kind of fun all the gay gamers can get together

1693
01:49:32,114 --> 01:49:34,857
[SPEAKER_02]: I really feel they need to include the asexual in that list too.

1694
01:49:37,120 --> 01:49:42,466
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's a big old long string of alphabet soup, but at some point it gets too big.

1695
01:49:42,686 --> 01:49:43,146
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?

1696
01:49:43,907 --> 01:49:44,288
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway.

1697
01:49:45,061 --> 01:49:45,842
[SPEAKER_01]: www.DarkSakura.com

1698
01:50:05,772 --> 01:50:09,417
[SPEAKER_01]: So it just sounds like this hodgepodge of just go play and have fun.

1699
01:50:09,697 --> 01:50:11,579
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what video games should be about anyway.

1700
01:50:11,599 --> 01:50:17,787
[SPEAKER_01]: It shouldn't even be about LGBT or Rayvars or Otaku or whatever.

1701
01:50:17,807 --> 01:50:19,008
[SPEAKER_01]: It should just be about just have fun.

1702
01:50:19,689 --> 01:50:20,230
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be a dick.

1703
01:50:21,693 --> 01:50:22,714
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.

1704
01:50:23,095 --> 01:50:24,236
[SPEAKER_01]: We got enough clicks in the real world.

1705
01:50:24,676 --> 01:50:26,218
[SPEAKER_04]: Always remember rule one.

1706
01:50:26,599 --> 01:50:27,139
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't be a dick.

1707
01:50:27,740 --> 01:50:28,240
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

1708
01:50:28,300 --> 01:50:28,601
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

1709
01:50:28,621 --> 01:50:29,101
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be a dick.

1710
01:50:29,161 --> 01:50:31,464
[SPEAKER_01]: And don't bring your click into the virtual world.

1711
01:50:32,645 --> 01:50:39,052
[SPEAKER_01]: And then lastly, DarkTetsuya on the tweeters wants us to plug his latest retro review for Mega Man on the site.

1712
01:50:39,133 --> 01:50:41,615
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually pretty awesome, so go check that out at OrangeLaunchVideo.com.

1713
01:50:44,520 --> 01:50:47,563
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to say expose on Mega Man, but it's a nice little retrospective.

1714
01:50:47,923 --> 01:50:50,345
[SPEAKER_06]: The original Mega Man games, I remember those very fondly.

1715
01:50:50,365 --> 01:50:51,085
[SPEAKER_06]: They were awesome.

1716
01:50:51,205 --> 01:50:56,610
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man, you've got to see some of the new ones, because the new ones invoke the old ones very well.

1717
01:50:56,670 --> 01:50:57,351
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very cool.

1718
01:50:58,551 --> 01:50:59,072
[SPEAKER_01]: Very, very cool.

1719
01:50:59,608 --> 01:51:01,609
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, let's get back into some other news here.

1720
01:51:01,629 --> 01:51:03,671
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to start off with a story on Kinect.

1721
01:51:04,131 --> 01:51:07,093
[SPEAKER_01]: Kinect, of course, being the motion control device coming out from Microsoft.

1722
01:51:07,393 --> 01:51:15,458
[SPEAKER_01]: We announced last week that it was going to be $150, although obviously speculation had run rampant on that for a while.

1723
01:51:16,158 --> 01:51:17,599
[SPEAKER_01]: It's coming with Kinect Adventures.

1724
01:51:18,099 --> 01:51:20,681
[SPEAKER_01]: And, of course, they got a lot of shit for that.

1725
01:51:21,161 --> 01:51:23,663
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I guess they came out this week.

1726
01:51:23,703 --> 01:51:25,905
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the marketing manager, Brett Siddons.

1727
01:51:26,105 --> 01:51:28,567
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the marketing manager for Microsoft Connects.

1728
01:51:29,107 --> 01:51:31,048
[SPEAKER_01]: He was at an event in the UK for Amazon.

1729
01:51:31,108 --> 01:51:34,791
[SPEAKER_01]: He says that Connect is, quote, very competitively priced.

1730
01:51:35,291 --> 01:51:38,714
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, since he was in the UK, he was talking about UK pricing, but you know what?

1731
01:51:38,734 --> 01:51:40,495
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all the same deal at the end of the day.

1732
01:51:41,396 --> 01:51:47,720
[SPEAKER_01]: He's basically saying that the navigation controller is going to be an extra $30 on top of the $100 bundle.

1733
01:51:47,800 --> 01:51:47,961
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

1734
01:51:49,042 --> 01:51:49,422
[SPEAKER_01]: and DJ Ranma S.

1735
01:52:07,542 --> 01:52:36,470
[SPEAKER_01]: uh so anyway uh Microsoft is basically trying to say hey if you want two people to have fun you only need one connect whereas with all these other systems you need two of everything and we kind of knew they'd go this way and I think as we talked about last week a little bit it's kind of like well but your console then offsets the price of a Wii and it's really all about the games at the end of the day honestly I mean you can charge plenty for this system as long as you have the games to back it up but if Dance Central is going to be your only good game

1736
01:52:37,495 --> 01:53:04,920
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if it's worth the time of all the E3 games that I saw for the Kinect the one that I really would love to go over to a friend's house and play because I do not own a 360 god forbid is the Children of Eden looks amazing it does look great it's too bad they didn't have a playable one on the show floor so we don't know enough about it but if you just imagine it's going to be Rez using your body that's cool enough for me

1737
01:53:05,185 --> 01:53:07,648
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that just looks absolutely amazing.

1738
01:53:08,929 --> 01:53:09,910
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be great.

1739
01:53:11,172 --> 01:53:13,014
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, DarkSakura, what do you got for us?

1740
01:53:15,754 --> 01:53:17,675
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this is actually pretty cool.

1741
01:53:18,476 --> 01:53:28,503
[SPEAKER_02]: Silent Hill 8, the guy who's writing it, Tom Waltz, is also working on a comic book crossover called Silent Hill Past Life.

1742
01:53:29,143 --> 01:53:39,570
[SPEAKER_02]: Set in 1867 and is about an outlaw called Jebediah Foster who meets a widow that changes his ways.

1743
01:53:40,531 --> 01:53:43,152
[SPEAKER_02]: And they move to Silent Hill to escape the Wild West.

1744
01:53:44,433 --> 01:53:47,435
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but, of course, Silent Hill screws them over.

1745
01:53:49,135 --> 01:53:54,458
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but, it's that, um, the game is going to feature a character from the comic.

1746
01:53:54,938 --> 01:53:56,619
[SPEAKER_02]: Although the game is in modern times.

1747
01:53:58,099 --> 01:54:01,681
[SPEAKER_02]: So, hey, I hope that they do better.

1748
01:54:02,741 --> 01:54:05,823
[SPEAKER_02]: The trailer is out, though, for Silent Hill 8, and I really need to sit down and watch it.

1749
01:54:08,564 --> 01:54:09,925
[SPEAKER_01]: They showed a little bit at E3.

1750
01:54:10,225 --> 01:54:10,745
[SPEAKER_01]: It looked alright.

1751
01:54:12,846 --> 01:54:14,109
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that you have to put in your birthday.

1752
01:54:15,372 --> 01:54:16,034
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's not awesome?

1753
01:54:16,054 --> 01:54:17,938
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, because it's restricted content, young lady.

1754
01:54:17,958 --> 01:54:18,339
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

1755
01:54:19,918 --> 01:54:24,141
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, well, while she's watching that, I have to bring this up.

1756
01:54:24,281 --> 01:54:28,544
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize in advance, but let's all poke a little fun at Zynga this week.

1757
01:54:29,125 --> 01:54:31,526
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they did something where they're getting a lot of shit for it.

1758
01:54:31,606 --> 01:54:34,568
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you don't like Zynga, you can kind of jump on the bandwagon with this.

1759
01:54:34,608 --> 01:54:35,089
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be fun.

1760
01:54:35,369 --> 01:54:35,989
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, here's the deal.

1761
01:54:36,470 --> 01:54:37,831
[SPEAKER_01]: Zynga has this game on Facebook.

1762
01:54:37,871 --> 01:54:39,091
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called Street Racing.

1763
01:54:39,812 --> 01:54:45,856
[SPEAKER_01]: And they announced, with really no rhyme or reason, that they are shutting the game down tomorrow, August 2nd.

1764
01:54:47,257 --> 01:54:48,358
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1765
01:55:10,376 --> 01:55:10,636
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura.com

1766
01:55:29,915 --> 01:55:40,220
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Zynga came out this week and said, quote, as an acknowledgement of the inconvenience these changes may have caused, we have offered credits to all players who have made a purchase in the last 90 days.

1767
01:55:42,761 --> 01:55:43,021
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1768
01:55:44,502 --> 01:55:53,866
[SPEAKER_01]: So these players will receive a credit for the exact amounts of their purchases, plus an additional 100 units of premium currency in any of Zynga's nine most popular games.

1769
01:55:55,242 --> 01:55:58,686
[SPEAKER_01]: So in other words, if you bought stuff, they're not going to refund you.

1770
01:55:58,786 --> 01:56:02,190
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just going to let you have credits for other games.

1771
01:56:03,592 --> 01:56:05,233
[SPEAKER_01]: What if I don't want those other games?

1772
01:56:08,729 --> 01:56:16,173
[SPEAKER_01]: Although we can kind of sit here and kind of point and laugh and ha-ha at Zynga and who bought that shit anyway, it does kind of lead to this scary precedent.

1773
01:56:16,933 --> 01:56:23,277
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, right now you can buy things in World of Warcraft, right?

1774
01:56:24,137 --> 01:56:28,679
[SPEAKER_01]: And what if in World of Warcraft you buy, I don't know, like a pet?

1775
01:56:28,839 --> 01:56:30,520
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going to happen when World of Warcraft goes away?

1776
01:56:30,880 --> 01:56:32,161
[SPEAKER_01]: You lose that pet.

1777
01:56:32,721 --> 01:56:33,182
[SPEAKER_01]: Which, you know...

1778
01:56:34,182 --> 01:56:36,063
[SPEAKER_01]: Duh, you should know that.

1779
01:56:36,183 --> 01:56:38,244
[SPEAKER_01]: Games don't last forever and so forth.

1780
01:56:38,284 --> 01:56:43,866
[SPEAKER_01]: But it should be something you think about before you get these, you know, untangible items, correct?

1781
01:56:44,266 --> 01:56:46,367
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this serves as a little bit of a lesson.

1782
01:56:46,747 --> 01:56:49,308
[SPEAKER_01]: If ever this game decides to shut its doors...

1783
01:56:51,517 --> 01:56:52,218
[SPEAKER_04]: It's gone.

1784
01:57:18,679 --> 01:57:20,260
[SPEAKER_04]: So you don't lose it.

1785
01:57:20,701 --> 01:57:21,141
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't lose it.

1786
01:57:21,201 --> 01:57:31,148
[SPEAKER_04]: Which, you know, the whole thing that they're shutting it down, you know, it's for no rhyme or reason, nothing.

1787
01:57:32,105 --> 01:57:33,086
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura.com

1788
01:57:52,142 --> 01:57:56,466
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyhow, let's see, where are we at?

1789
01:57:57,627 --> 01:58:12,660
[SPEAKER_01]: Comments in chatroom, chat.orange.com Bonds006 says, but Neopets, PetPet, they live, I hope Neopets is another one of those sites that might go away someday Hitstun, if ever Xbox Live goes offline, you can't play any of the Xbox Live indie games you bought

1790
01:58:13,480 --> 01:58:13,960
[SPEAKER_01]: Good point.

1791
01:58:14,061 --> 01:58:16,882
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, original Xbox was just shut down a couple months ago.

1792
01:58:17,243 --> 01:58:21,205
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that mean in about five years the Xbox we have now is also going to get shut down?

1793
01:58:21,305 --> 01:58:22,706
[SPEAKER_01]: And then all these indie games go wrong?

1794
01:58:23,627 --> 01:58:29,931
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of funny because a lot of people were giving crap to OnLive, the new service that's out that lets you play games through the streaming service.

1795
01:58:30,351 --> 01:58:34,414
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you're going to buy this game for $50, but it's really only guaranteed to work for three years.

1796
01:58:34,594 --> 01:58:36,075
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they might pull the plug on OnLive.

1797
01:58:36,735 --> 01:58:41,418
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas if you go to the store and buy a game for $50, you pretty much have it quote-unquote forever.

1798
01:58:41,718 --> 01:58:41,858
[SPEAKER_08]: Mm-hmm.

1799
01:58:43,379 --> 01:58:44,460
[SPEAKER_01]: Just things to think about.

1800
01:58:44,620 --> 01:58:46,862
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know one way or the other.

1801
01:58:47,002 --> 01:58:52,045
[SPEAKER_04]: It kind of almost reminds me of the old school Nintendo.

1802
01:58:52,666 --> 01:58:58,129
[SPEAKER_04]: Every time a new console would come out, you can't use the old school games in the new console.

1803
01:58:58,189 --> 01:59:04,854
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like you just plunker down 15 bucks to buy that really awesome version of Zelda that won't go in your Super Nintendo.

1804
01:59:05,354 --> 01:59:06,615
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing was backward compatible.

1805
01:59:06,695 --> 01:59:12,037
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I kind of stuck to the PlayStation series so I can play my old PlayStation games on the PS2.

1806
01:59:12,217 --> 01:59:15,939
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess they're all backward compatible with the PS3 too.

1807
01:59:16,039 --> 01:59:19,620
[SPEAKER_01]: PS1 is, and this is what doesn't make sense about Sony.

1808
01:59:19,720 --> 01:59:24,862
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends what console you got and how early you bought a PS3 if you can backwards compatible or can't.

1809
01:59:25,122 --> 01:59:26,123
[SPEAKER_01]: I think she can, but I can't.

1810
01:59:26,163 --> 01:59:29,624
[SPEAKER_02]: I can because we have a first release PS3.

1811
01:59:29,664 --> 01:59:33,946
[SPEAKER_02]: They took out a lot of the extra bells and whistles with later releases.

1812
01:59:34,546 --> 02:00:02,118
[SPEAKER_02]: so if I bought a PS3 now I wouldn't be able to he probably couldn't do jack shit no sir not unless you got really lucky in finding a used one and a lot of people jack up the prices of those that are backwards compatible you know what's extra funny is that usually Dan and I wait until second releases come out when we get stuff because we're usually not initial adopters of consoles and phones and stuff but we got this right away and we sort of got a reward because our discover card gave us back a hundred bucks

1813
02:00:03,338 --> 02:00:05,581
[SPEAKER_06]: So would a new PS3 let you play a PS2 game?

1814
02:00:05,601 --> 02:00:08,643
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I know they still sell PS2 games.

1815
02:00:09,324 --> 02:00:11,787
[SPEAKER_02]: However, I think I've got an extra PS2 you could probably borrow.

1816
02:00:12,027 --> 02:00:13,628
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a PS2 that works just fine.

1817
02:00:13,688 --> 02:00:15,110
[SPEAKER_01]: You can play PS1 games.

1818
02:00:16,537 --> 02:00:17,378
[SPEAKER_02]: and Imports, right?

1819
02:00:17,618 --> 02:00:18,279
[SPEAKER_02]: Import PS1 games.

1820
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:24,365
[SPEAKER_01]: No, the region locks are still in place for PS1 and PS2 but it's region free for the new games.

1821
02:00:24,906 --> 02:00:25,346
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

1822
02:00:25,526 --> 02:00:26,828
[SPEAKER_01]: PS3 games are region free.

1823
02:00:27,288 --> 02:00:27,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1824
02:00:27,969 --> 02:00:36,557
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is interesting but you might remember like Loki imported a racing game that he thought was awful but he imported it.

1825
02:00:37,778 --> 02:00:47,183
[SPEAKER_01]: And the exciting thing is, if Beatmania 2DX ever comes out on the PlayStation 3, I know that was the game that made me buy a Japanese PlayStation 2 so I could play it.

1826
02:00:47,203 --> 02:00:47,563
[SPEAKER_01]: Same here.

1827
02:00:47,703 --> 02:00:50,044
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how obsessed with this music game series I was.

1828
02:00:50,604 --> 02:00:54,826
[SPEAKER_01]: If they do release that on PS3 in the future, which I hope they will, it's going to break down that...

1829
02:00:55,987 --> 02:00:56,527
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we did ours too.

1830
02:01:11,196 --> 02:01:11,416
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.

1831
02:01:12,717 --> 02:01:13,377
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people did.

1832
02:01:13,397 --> 02:01:13,978
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't just me.

1833
02:01:14,198 --> 02:01:15,999
[SPEAKER_04]: I still have my old clunker at home.

1834
02:01:16,239 --> 02:01:19,802
[SPEAKER_04]: My wonderful, the original PS2 box.

1835
02:01:20,282 --> 02:01:28,007
[SPEAKER_01]: Props to those PS2s for holding up after all those years because I believe we heard Bobby on the show right before us talking about his Xbox 360 red-ringed.

1836
02:01:28,428 --> 02:01:32,350
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my friends just sent me a text over the weekend, my 360 red-ringed frown face.

1837
02:01:33,211 --> 02:01:34,511
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't build them like they used to.

1838
02:01:34,591 --> 02:01:35,132
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they don't.

1839
02:01:35,412 --> 02:01:41,614
[SPEAKER_06]: My PS2 is still up and going because I don't use it that much, mostly for DVDs, but yeah, it still works.

1840
02:01:42,214 --> 02:01:48,016
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not real confident about Sony optical drives, just bad experiences, but we'll see how long it lasts.

1841
02:01:48,056 --> 02:01:48,696
[SPEAKER_06]: So far, so good.

1842
02:01:49,606 --> 02:01:52,487
[SPEAKER_01]: Breast Lowell is in our chat and says, I still want to get a JPS2.

1843
02:01:52,547 --> 02:01:54,367
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the good news is it's really cheap now.

1844
02:01:54,667 --> 02:01:56,368
[SPEAKER_01]: You probably get it for only about $100 now.

1845
02:01:56,748 --> 02:01:57,748
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe $120, $150.

1846
02:01:57,888 --> 02:01:59,889
[SPEAKER_01]: For a Japanese PlayStation 2, yes.

1847
02:02:00,189 --> 02:02:04,310
[SPEAKER_01]: But keep in mind, if you import a console from Japan, it's only going to play the Japanese games.

1848
02:02:04,830 --> 02:02:09,291
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's got to be something out there that you can't get here, like dating sims.

1849
02:02:09,891 --> 02:02:10,131
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1850
02:02:11,411 --> 02:02:13,532
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go to our mailbag.

1851
02:02:15,342 --> 02:02:17,564
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see if some of the faces have changed in our mailbag.

1852
02:02:17,584 --> 02:02:20,086
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking about some things never change.

1853
02:02:20,246 --> 02:02:21,206
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see about the emails.

1854
02:02:21,547 --> 02:02:24,389
[SPEAKER_01]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us an email.

1855
02:02:24,429 --> 02:02:26,030
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we got quite a few this week, right Jamie?

1856
02:02:26,891 --> 02:02:27,451
[SPEAKER_02]: A few more, yeah.

1857
02:02:28,091 --> 02:02:31,494
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, this is your friendly neighborhood Mexican, except in Arizona, Actdeft.

1858
02:02:32,054 --> 02:02:34,917
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, very late congrats on your 8th anniversary.

1859
02:02:35,077 --> 02:02:35,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep up the good work.

1860
02:02:36,238 --> 02:02:36,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, sir.

1861
02:02:37,518 --> 02:02:40,621
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that I said that, I want to comment on some stuff you talked about on your last show.

1862
02:02:41,101 --> 02:02:42,882
[SPEAKER_02]: First, about the connect and the move.

1863
02:02:43,803 --> 02:02:45,784
[SPEAKER_02]: You asked people if they're going to buy either of them.

1864
02:02:45,844 --> 02:02:55,329
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll probably get the Kinect later when it gets cheaper, because I really want to try both Dance Central and Dance Master, and probably other games that Microsoft may release in the future.

1865
02:02:55,989 --> 02:02:58,390
[SPEAKER_02]: And Kinect does really look awesome.

1866
02:02:58,610 --> 02:03:05,874
[SPEAKER_02]: But the move, first of all, I don't own a PS3 yet, so before I get the move, I need a really good reason to get a PS3, which right now is nothing.

1867
02:03:06,997 --> 02:03:08,218
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1868
02:03:26,676 --> 02:03:31,621
[SPEAKER_02]: I consider that their biggest problem and why the move may fail.

1869
02:03:32,522 --> 02:03:36,386
[SPEAKER_02]: And the PlayStation Network in Mexico and other Latin American countries sucks.

1870
02:03:36,827 --> 02:03:40,911
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, little to no content at all, and they want me to pay for a plus service too?

1871
02:03:41,171 --> 02:03:41,632
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right.

1872
02:03:42,938 --> 02:03:44,860
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, this is a long email.

1873
02:03:45,101 --> 02:03:47,904
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing that you discussed was controllers versus keyboards and mouse.

1874
02:03:48,364 --> 02:03:51,168
[SPEAKER_02]: I really think it comes down to what you're playing and how you're playing.

1875
02:03:51,668 --> 02:03:55,893
[SPEAKER_02]: For first person shooters, sure, keyboard and mouse are way better because of precision and other stuff.

1876
02:03:56,254 --> 02:04:02,621
[SPEAKER_02]: But for platformers or action games, I prefer controllers since it will give more comfort and allow you to do more stuff like jumping and attacking.

1877
02:04:03,762 --> 02:04:18,892
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to put two games as an example, Mirror's Edge and Psychonauts Mirror's Edge, while you can play with a keyboard and mouse just fine there are a lot of button combinations that are easier to do with a controller and with Psychonauts the game was designed for consoles so the keyboard controls are just plain awkward

1878
02:04:19,853 --> 02:04:28,396
[SPEAKER_02]: There are games that are easier with keyboard and mouse like Team Fortress 2 and Left 4 Dead, not to mention point-and-click adventures, western RPGs, strategy games, or MMOs.

1879
02:04:28,996 --> 02:04:33,338
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think you just need to learn both ways of controlling games and get the hang of both.

1880
02:04:33,578 --> 02:04:39,040
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no better way of playing games in general, just a more comfortable way to play certain games, which I agree with, by the way.

1881
02:04:39,981 --> 02:04:41,162
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's all I want to say.

1882
02:04:41,242 --> 02:04:41,963
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for reading.

1883
02:04:42,063 --> 02:04:42,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Until next time.

1884
02:04:42,965 --> 02:04:43,245
[SPEAKER_02]: P.S.

1885
02:04:43,685 --> 02:04:47,871
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry my lack of articles on the OLR main page, but no internet at home makes it difficult to do so.

1886
02:04:48,251 --> 02:04:48,692
[SPEAKER_02]: P.S.S.

1887
02:04:48,952 --> 02:04:50,634
[SPEAKER_02]: Suck it, Arizona, and your racist laws.

1888
02:04:51,596 --> 02:04:52,497
[SPEAKER_02]: Deft is Cabrown.

1889
02:04:55,073 --> 02:05:13,207
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, well, I think, especially the keyboard mouse part, I think a lot of the debate usually is around first person shooters, but definitely you bring up a good point about, you know, it really depends on the type of game you're playing, absolutely, is that, you know, keyboard mouse ain't gonna cut it, I think, as well for a game like Psychonauts, but...

1890
02:05:14,088 --> 02:05:17,829
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, I don't know if it's because... I don't even know how to explain it.

1891
02:05:17,909 --> 02:05:22,071
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to play Quake just fine with keyboard and mouse, but some of these new games are just too many buttons.

1892
02:05:23,691 --> 02:05:27,173
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, I know, but yet when I hold a controller in my hand, it makes sense.

1893
02:05:27,313 --> 02:05:28,153
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't explain it.

1894
02:05:28,253 --> 02:05:29,654
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't expect anyone else to understand it.

1895
02:05:29,774 --> 02:05:30,674
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just the way it is for me.

1896
02:05:30,874 --> 02:05:39,216
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you what's funny is that when I was playing PSO, I could not, I mean, you can play it with a keyboard, it just was much more comfortable with a controller.

1897
02:05:39,756 --> 02:05:44,417
[SPEAKER_02]: But Final Fantasy XI, everyone was saying, why aren't you playing with a keyboard, why aren't you using a keyboard, why aren't you using a keyboard?

1898
02:05:44,678 --> 02:05:46,558
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, because I can do just fine with my controller.

1899
02:05:47,658 --> 02:05:48,959
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted one for World of Warcraft.

1900
02:05:49,179 --> 02:05:51,479
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate playing World of Warcraft because I hate playing it on the keyboard.

1901
02:05:52,860 --> 02:05:53,660
[SPEAKER_01]: What about Star Trek Online?

1902
02:05:53,680 --> 02:05:54,320
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't that all keyboard?

1903
02:05:54,685 --> 02:06:02,328
[SPEAKER_02]: It is, but for some reason, when you get into space combat, it really helps to have a mouse.

1904
02:06:03,249 --> 02:06:03,589
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

1905
02:06:03,889 --> 02:06:08,731
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you can rotate your camera with it, as well as do direct targeting.

1906
02:06:10,132 --> 02:06:11,572
[SPEAKER_02]: So, it works a lot better.

1907
02:06:11,692 --> 02:06:19,956
[SPEAKER_04]: As well as the difference between even different versions of the same game, like the different Wii versus PlayStation versions.

1908
02:06:20,036 --> 02:06:22,897
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I played the original PlayStation 2 version of Okami...

1909
02:06:23,577 --> 02:06:24,158
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay!

1910
02:06:24,738 --> 02:06:25,179
[SPEAKER_04]: Fun game.

1911
02:06:25,859 --> 02:06:31,924
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I played the Wii re-release, and surprisingly, I liked the PlayStation 1 better.

1912
02:06:32,424 --> 02:06:38,669
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the Wii Remote, I don't know what it was, it just felt more...

1913
02:06:39,824 --> 02:06:40,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Clunky.

1914
02:06:40,904 --> 02:06:41,765
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?

1915
02:06:42,285 --> 02:06:45,106
[SPEAKER_04]: It felt like it was rushed.

1916
02:06:45,286 --> 02:06:55,231
[SPEAKER_04]: It felt like it was, you know, they were just trying to hurry it out as fast as they could and they didn't bother with the calibration that they needed to make it good.

1917
02:06:56,391 --> 02:06:57,872
[SPEAKER_04]: With PlayStation 2, you don't have that problem.

1918
02:06:58,052 --> 02:06:59,512
[SPEAKER_04]: You do not have that problem with Okami.

1919
02:07:03,914 --> 02:07:04,795
[SPEAKER_01]: How about the next email?

1920
02:07:05,095 --> 02:07:06,535
[SPEAKER_02]: We're fond of calling it the Wiimote.

1921
02:07:09,368 --> 02:07:16,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Weemote, Weemote, Weemote, Weemote, Weemote, Weemote, I don't know this.

1922
02:07:16,216 --> 02:07:17,017
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't own one.

1923
02:07:19,180 --> 02:07:23,364
[SPEAKER_02]: Good morning everyone, this is Jeet, it's the other Swede, writing in once again.

1924
02:07:24,265 --> 02:07:30,229
[SPEAKER_02]: This time I'd like to comment a bit on the discussion that was brought forth last time concerning the accuracy and comfort when it comes to controllers.

1925
02:07:30,790 --> 02:07:35,994
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I could start a five-page rant about why a mouse and keyboard is far superior to any console controllers, but I won't.

1926
02:07:36,774 --> 02:07:41,878
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason is that I am very biased, and due to that bias, I can't objectively say that the mouse is better.

1927
02:07:42,378 --> 02:07:47,222
[SPEAKER_02]: It's only a personal preference embedded in me during my childhood thanks to my uncle who introduced me to PC gaming.

1928
02:07:47,942 --> 02:07:57,373
[SPEAKER_02]: It's simple, whatever controller you like, be it an Xbox 360 controller, Playstation Move, or mouse, it's only the best peripheral for you personally, not the whole world and everyone in it.

1929
02:07:57,594 --> 02:07:58,074
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you!

1930
02:07:59,416 --> 02:08:07,565
[SPEAKER_02]: To sum it up, the discussion of what control method is the quote best is pointless since it all comes down to what you are skilled at using or prefer.

1931
02:08:08,266 --> 02:08:08,646
[SPEAKER_02]: P.S.

1932
02:08:09,046 --> 02:08:11,307
[SPEAKER_02]: Note that I didn't apologize for any spelling errors this time.

1933
02:08:11,547 --> 02:08:18,710
[SPEAKER_02]: That's because I realized it's rude for someone who grew up with English as their primary language to comment on minor flaws of someone who learned it as a second language.

1934
02:08:19,310 --> 02:08:22,011
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see you typing a letter to me in Swedish without grammatical errors in it.

1935
02:08:22,071 --> 02:08:23,492
[SPEAKER_02]: I still love you, even you, DarkSakura.

1936
02:08:24,392 --> 02:08:28,534
[SPEAKER_02]: And by the way, if I know someone's typing from another country, I don't give them a hard time.

1937
02:08:29,554 --> 02:08:29,954
[SPEAKER_02]: If I know.

1938
02:08:30,835 --> 02:08:31,575
[SPEAKER_02]: If I don't, I'm sorry.

1939
02:08:32,595 --> 02:08:33,156
[SPEAKER_02]: P.S.S.

1940
02:08:33,456 --> 02:08:35,517
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for reading my letter and I hope your hand is feeling better.

1941
02:08:35,737 --> 02:08:36,757
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, but it's not.

1942
02:08:38,084 --> 02:08:43,331
[SPEAKER_01]: Drew Nami in our chatroom at chat.orange.radio.com says, IKEA controller for the Swedish email.

1943
02:08:43,791 --> 02:08:44,232
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.

1944
02:08:44,752 --> 02:08:45,273
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh-huh.

1945
02:08:46,274 --> 02:08:49,578
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, apparently it's international email night at Orange Challenge Radio.

1946
02:08:49,598 --> 02:08:52,922
[SPEAKER_01]: But hey, that's awesome to know that we have listeners all over the globe.

1947
02:08:52,962 --> 02:08:53,583
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so awesome.

1948
02:08:53,991 --> 02:08:54,771
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, next email.

1949
02:08:55,792 --> 02:08:58,314
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey Orange Lounge, long time listener, first time responder.

1950
02:08:59,114 --> 02:09:01,095
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, we got the cliche.

1951
02:09:01,435 --> 02:09:01,756
[SPEAKER_01]: Love it.

1952
02:09:02,276 --> 02:09:07,039
[SPEAKER_02]: As for the move, personally I think it will be the better motion control option.

1953
02:09:07,399 --> 02:09:12,562
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, the price point is high, but I think it will be the most accurate on the most powerful system of the three.

1954
02:09:13,102 --> 02:09:18,185
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw some great screen tests demonstrating its abilities and I think it could be a hardcore alternative to the Wii.

1955
02:09:18,626 --> 02:09:20,347
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the main reason I have avoided the Wii.

1956
02:09:20,427 --> 02:09:21,728
[SPEAKER_02]: It lacks the hardcore devotion.

1957
02:09:21,748 --> 02:09:22,168
[SPEAKER_02]: Snow5.

1958
02:09:25,154 --> 02:09:27,557
[SPEAKER_01]: Just playing devil's advocate to your email.

1959
02:09:27,678 --> 02:09:38,012
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of get that perspective and that's why a lot of people have avoided the Wii, but what about games like Brawl and Metroid Other M and some of these other kind of like, and GoldenEye, some of these other cool things that are on the Wii.

1960
02:09:38,072 --> 02:09:40,755
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, is that not hardcore enough?

1961
02:09:40,775 --> 02:09:41,476
[SPEAKER_05]: No More Heroes?

1962
02:09:42,157 --> 02:10:06,003
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah I mean I don't know it's kind of like I it feels like there's some cool stuff on the way I mean granted maybe not as much and yeah we kind of made some errors when it comes to not being online I think that's one of their like biggest flaws is that there's the multiplayer online is just a joke you know compared to what else is out there I agree but appreciate the perspective we have two more emails to go no

1963
02:10:06,684 --> 02:10:07,004
[SPEAKER_02]: Too bad!

1964
02:10:07,024 --> 02:10:09,186
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's why you sound like an auctioneer.

1965
02:10:27,017 --> 02:10:27,217
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1966
02:10:28,999 --> 02:10:33,003
[SPEAKER_02]: Second is I'm wondering if there was a way to get the live stream via mobile platform, i.e.

1967
02:10:33,083 --> 02:10:33,683
[SPEAKER_02]: a MotoDroid.

1968
02:10:33,844 --> 02:10:40,730
[SPEAKER_02]: Third is actually two things in the first letting being that DarkSakura is a fiend for grammar, spelling, and punctuation.

1969
02:10:40,750 --> 02:10:44,413
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it might interest you to know that the site has lasted, has several

1970
02:10:45,134 --> 02:10:49,075
[SPEAKER_02]: Lastly, I wonder what point during this email she stops reading this and starts to have convulsions.

1971
02:10:49,416 --> 02:10:54,317
[SPEAKER_02]: As I've written this without punctuation, I have made several misspellings and several grammatical errors on purpose.

1972
02:10:54,737 --> 02:10:57,838
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that I don't like her or anything, I just thought that I might get a giggle.

1973
02:10:58,159 --> 02:10:59,719
[SPEAKER_02]: Good times all and keep up the good work.

1974
02:11:00,339 --> 02:11:04,081
[SPEAKER_02]: I figured by then it was, hey, you did use...

1975
02:11:06,997 --> 02:11:11,041
[SPEAKER_01]: You gotta laugh at me anytime somebody writes in to give DarkSakura some shit.

1976
02:11:11,081 --> 02:11:11,501
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.

1977
02:11:11,962 --> 02:11:16,346
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm laughing at this because I realized by that point that it was on purpose.

1978
02:11:16,706 --> 02:11:18,207
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a punctuation troll?

1979
02:11:19,509 --> 02:11:23,873
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, we have our first grammar troll on Orange Lounge Radio.

1980
02:11:23,913 --> 02:11:24,633
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.

1981
02:11:24,653 --> 02:11:25,614
[SPEAKER_02]: You get a gold star.

1982
02:11:25,634 --> 02:11:26,895
[SPEAKER_01]: You totally get a gold star.

1983
02:11:26,935 --> 02:11:28,437
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is from Kane I Am.

1984
02:11:28,857 --> 02:11:30,659
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't sign it, but I'm taking it from the email.

1985
02:11:30,819 --> 02:11:35,401
[SPEAKER_01]: Kane IM, you get a gold star for being the first grammar troll at Orange Lounge Radio.

1986
02:11:35,581 --> 02:11:37,822
[SPEAKER_02]: And the subject of the subject is we, yay, wahoo.

1987
02:11:38,402 --> 02:11:42,024
[SPEAKER_01]: Please, that is not encouraging others to copy what this gentleman has done.

1988
02:11:42,484 --> 02:11:45,265
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because if you do it the first time, you're clever.

1989
02:11:45,405 --> 02:11:47,166
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyone who does it the second time is stupid.

1990
02:11:47,492 --> 02:11:50,033
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, what was the real question here, though?

1991
02:11:50,053 --> 02:11:52,775
[SPEAKER_01]: There was something in there I actually wanted to answer that had come up in there.

1992
02:11:52,855 --> 02:11:53,915
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Loki's job.

1993
02:11:54,395 --> 02:11:55,596
[SPEAKER_01]: He works for a game distributor.

1994
02:11:55,796 --> 02:12:02,619
[SPEAKER_01]: So he actually, like, he's kind of the middleman between gaming companies and the actual stores.

1995
02:12:03,900 --> 02:12:05,861
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that for iPhone we use apps.

1996
02:12:25,046 --> 02:12:32,930
[SPEAKER_01]: There's an All Games app on the iPhone, supposedly, but I guess it disappeared this week, so I don't know what's going on there.

1997
02:12:32,990 --> 02:12:35,752
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a Scott question, not a Rob question, so I don't know.

1998
02:12:36,792 --> 02:12:37,673
[SPEAKER_01]: But I will say this.

1999
02:12:37,833 --> 02:12:41,555
[SPEAKER_01]: Any program that can use Shoutcast can listen to the All Games stream.

2000
02:12:41,835 --> 02:12:44,096
[SPEAKER_01]: You just have to get the link for the Shoutcast feed.

2001
02:12:44,136 --> 02:12:45,817
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little silly for me to yell it out here.

2002
02:12:45,877 --> 02:12:47,658
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Pandora has a...

2003
02:12:49,184 --> 02:12:51,886
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to all... Well, Pandora's... Does it have shoutcast mode in it, though?

2004
02:12:52,006 --> 02:12:52,306
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

2005
02:12:52,346 --> 02:12:52,826
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

2006
02:12:53,086 --> 02:12:56,528
[SPEAKER_01]: But most mobile phones have some type of shoutcast tuner app.

2007
02:12:56,608 --> 02:13:01,191
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, anything that's like, listen to thousands of internet radio stations is probably a shoutcast app.

2008
02:13:01,571 --> 02:13:06,073
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you go to allgames.com, you can get the link to listen to all games radio.

2009
02:13:06,534 --> 02:13:06,714
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

2010
02:13:06,834 --> 02:13:07,374
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty easy.

2011
02:13:08,134 --> 02:13:08,435
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

2012
02:13:08,875 --> 02:13:10,876
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the grammar thing.

2013
02:13:11,616 --> 02:13:12,337
[SPEAKER_02]: Which I'm laughing.

2014
02:13:12,397 --> 02:13:14,698
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually laughing because I realized it was on purpose.

2015
02:13:14,963 --> 02:13:27,188
[SPEAKER_01]: How funny, Tiger, I'm sorry, I have to say this, Tiger Call in our chat room is saying since the All Games app isn't up right now, you can get the Video Game Outsiders iPhone app because they're another show on the network, they do Tuesdays here, and I guess their app does it.

2016
02:13:28,288 --> 02:13:28,728
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.

2017
02:13:29,749 --> 02:13:31,810
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I guess a backup.

2018
02:13:32,090 --> 02:13:32,670
[SPEAKER_02]: The last one.

2019
02:13:35,452 --> 02:13:36,373
[SPEAKER_02]: Greetings, OLR.

2020
02:13:36,493 --> 02:13:37,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Rini here.

2021
02:13:37,873 --> 02:13:42,194
[SPEAKER_02]: I will soon be the proud owner of a new Beatles Rock Band limited edition bundle that I scored for $20.

2022
02:13:43,515 --> 02:13:52,517
[SPEAKER_02]: However, I have not owned a Rock Band game until now, so I was wondering if you and the listeners could give any advice on what I should know about keeping my gear in great condition.

2023
02:13:54,538 --> 02:13:55,238
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say...

2024
02:13:57,043 --> 02:13:59,046
[SPEAKER_02]: Sanitize it if other people play it.

2025
02:14:00,248 --> 02:14:03,052
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially if they have greasy fingers.

2026
02:14:03,352 --> 02:14:05,675
[SPEAKER_01]: Or liquor is being mixed with those controllers.

2027
02:14:06,116 --> 02:14:06,637
[SPEAKER_01]: Seriously.

2028
02:14:07,276 --> 02:14:15,139
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, um, those monitor wipes that you can use to clean, like, your computer screen, those might be good for it.

2029
02:14:15,219 --> 02:14:16,360
[SPEAKER_02]: Alcohol prep pads, yo.

2030
02:14:16,460 --> 02:14:17,921
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm.

2031
02:14:17,941 --> 02:14:21,622
[SPEAKER_01]: Because alcohol just dries... Clorox wipes are, like, the greatest invention ever.

2032
02:14:21,642 --> 02:14:22,903
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but you gotta be careful with those.

2033
02:14:23,043 --> 02:14:24,984
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's true, you don't want to bleach your controllers, I guess that's true.

2034
02:14:25,004 --> 02:14:35,328
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, the horrible thing is, is when you said, you know, if alcohol's being mixed with drinks, I got this horrible mental image of a Rock Band controller mixing a giant vat of alcohol.

2035
02:14:36,476 --> 02:14:37,750
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't use it for that purpose.

2036
02:14:38,482 --> 02:14:41,463
[SPEAKER_06]: You must hate your rock band if you're doing that.

2037
02:14:42,284 --> 02:14:47,306
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, when you store them, make sure that you don't have them stacked up haphazardly.

2038
02:14:48,707 --> 02:14:55,050
[SPEAKER_02]: We usually stand ours up on end and put them in a corner to where they won't really fall on each other.

2039
02:14:55,190 --> 02:15:00,933
[SPEAKER_01]: If you really want to take good care of them, and this is the way to do it, just go get one of those big plastic storage tubs at Target.

2040
02:15:01,493 --> 02:15:03,254
[SPEAKER_01]: It would cost you only a couple bucks.

2041
02:15:03,394 --> 02:15:04,554
[SPEAKER_01]: Ikea would have them too.

2042
02:15:04,694 --> 02:15:05,795
[SPEAKER_01]: Any place ought to have it.

2043
02:15:06,195 --> 02:15:07,076
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2044
02:15:23,120 --> 02:15:24,361
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't Stop Believin'

2045
02:15:52,125 --> 02:15:52,886
[SPEAKER_01]: is really all you need.

2046
02:15:53,026 --> 02:15:53,787
[SPEAKER_02]: Skull Crusher Mountain.

2047
02:15:54,888 --> 02:15:57,391
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely look for the free stuff on the Marketplace.

2048
02:15:57,431 --> 02:15:58,432
[SPEAKER_01]: Jonathan Colton stuff.

2049
02:15:58,572 --> 02:16:00,494
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really about what type of music you're into.

2050
02:16:00,614 --> 02:16:01,335
[SPEAKER_02]: And Stephen Colbert.

2051
02:16:02,936 --> 02:16:03,517
[SPEAKER_01]: Lady Gaga.

2052
02:16:04,057 --> 02:16:05,359
[SPEAKER_02]: Blah.

2053
02:16:05,579 --> 02:16:06,800
[SPEAKER_01]: Blah yourself.

2054
02:16:06,900 --> 02:16:07,321
[SPEAKER_01]: Haters.

2055
02:16:07,701 --> 02:16:08,102
[SPEAKER_01]: Haters.

2056
02:16:08,262 --> 02:16:09,022
[SPEAKER_01]: Haters.

2057
02:16:09,103 --> 02:16:10,204
[SPEAKER_02]: Haters gonna hate, Rob.

2058
02:16:10,224 --> 02:16:10,764
[SPEAKER_02]: Haters gonna hate.

2059
02:16:10,784 --> 02:16:11,265
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

2060
02:16:11,545 --> 02:16:12,066
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, boy.

2061
02:16:13,550 --> 02:16:13,930
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

2062
02:16:15,371 --> 02:16:16,532
[SPEAKER_06]: Stop the hate.

2063
02:16:16,772 --> 02:16:17,412
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

2064
02:16:18,132 --> 02:16:28,278
[SPEAKER_02]: I have actually said this, Rob, and I made this statement clear when we went out to Vic's Ice Cream downtown, that I do not dislike Lady Gaga.

2065
02:16:28,878 --> 02:16:34,701
[SPEAKER_02]: I dislike the radio versions of her songs, but every time I've heard piano versions, I've really liked them.

2066
02:16:37,429 --> 02:16:41,053
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

2067
02:16:41,113 --> 02:16:41,893
[SPEAKER_06]: No one cur.

2068
02:16:42,174 --> 02:16:45,817
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought you just disliked the performance art aspects of her videos.

2069
02:16:46,117 --> 02:16:49,220
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't like her videos, but I mean, I like the video for Alejandro.

2070
02:16:49,901 --> 02:16:52,663
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't like the videos, but the songs are pretty awesome.

2071
02:16:53,444 --> 02:16:54,325
[SPEAKER_01]: I like video games.

2072
02:16:54,866 --> 02:16:55,746
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, let's go on.

2073
02:16:56,627 --> 02:16:57,788
[SPEAKER_01]: I also like Angst.

2074
02:16:57,848 --> 02:17:00,651
[SPEAKER_01]: What a perfect segue into our FUs of the week.

2075
02:17:01,051 --> 02:17:01,672
[SPEAKER_01]: Yay!

2076
02:17:16,161 --> 02:17:23,686
[SPEAKER_01]: And now for those new to Orange Lounge Radio, this is the part of the show where we just say a big F you to whatever we've been waiting to say an F you to all week.

2077
02:17:23,846 --> 02:17:24,347
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura?

2078
02:17:25,147 --> 02:17:29,350
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to the hole in my hand and to my husband's blood pressure.

2079
02:17:30,491 --> 02:17:33,073
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna beat you, butthead.

2080
02:17:33,933 --> 02:17:34,173
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

2081
02:17:36,375 --> 02:17:40,898
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna give an F you to all the sand in my hypothetical vagina that I apparently have today.

2082
02:17:41,138 --> 02:17:41,418
[SPEAKER_01]: I just...

2083
02:17:43,188 --> 02:17:44,969
[SPEAKER_02]: are you feeling a little gritty and not so fresh?

2084
02:17:45,069 --> 02:18:01,240
[SPEAKER_04]: yes I have to say a big F you to any gaming company who is willing to charge multiple dollars for copies of games that I already own yes, I'm talking to you, PlayStation

2085
02:18:03,675 --> 02:18:09,356
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, the biggest FU, well, general FUs all around too.

2086
02:18:09,916 --> 02:18:12,377
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see, the list is long and distinguished, we'll keep it short.

2087
02:18:12,737 --> 02:18:15,858
[SPEAKER_06]: Fox News, Sarah Palin, Meg Whitman, boo!

2088
02:18:18,238 --> 02:18:20,239
[SPEAKER_06]: Carly Fiorna, oh god, no.

2089
02:18:20,379 --> 02:18:21,479
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought you were keeping it short.

2090
02:18:21,699 --> 02:18:23,179
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah, I am keeping it short.

2091
02:18:23,639 --> 02:18:25,720
[SPEAKER_06]: And the whole Republican Party, go rot, FU.

2092
02:18:28,154 --> 02:18:29,976
[SPEAKER_01]: That won't generate any emails tonight.

2093
02:18:30,957 --> 02:18:34,560
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, Rob, as an official woman, you can have an honorary vag.

2094
02:18:36,181 --> 02:18:36,802
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yay.

2095
02:18:36,902 --> 02:18:38,203
[SPEAKER_01]: Just what I've always wanted.

2096
02:18:38,363 --> 02:18:39,204
[SPEAKER_01]: You can keep it.

2097
02:18:39,845 --> 02:18:41,226
[SPEAKER_01]: These things are nothing but trouble.

2098
02:18:44,301 --> 02:18:45,661
[SPEAKER_02]: So you don't have to have a hypothetical one.

2099
02:18:45,681 --> 02:18:46,722
[SPEAKER_02]: You can have an honorary one.

2100
02:18:47,182 --> 02:18:47,842
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want one.

2101
02:18:47,942 --> 02:18:49,223
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the difference?

2102
02:18:50,023 --> 02:18:51,363
[SPEAKER_02]: They're both non-existent.

2103
02:18:51,383 --> 02:18:52,023
[SPEAKER_01]: Send it back.

2104
02:18:52,163 --> 02:18:54,604
[SPEAKER_01]: Return to sender.

2105
02:18:55,004 --> 02:18:56,145
[SPEAKER_02]: Do not want.

2106
02:18:56,265 --> 02:18:57,825
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob's pet vag.

2107
02:19:01,106 --> 02:19:01,986
[SPEAKER_01]: My little vag.

2108
02:19:03,767 --> 02:19:05,928
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a product idea for Hasbro.

2109
02:19:06,568 --> 02:19:07,388
[SPEAKER_12]: Imagine vagina.

2110
02:19:12,159 --> 02:19:12,519
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

2111
02:19:13,620 --> 02:19:15,302
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyhow, let's move on.

2112
02:19:15,382 --> 02:19:16,763
[SPEAKER_01]: Loki is in our chat room right now.

2113
02:19:17,083 --> 02:19:17,484
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

2114
02:19:17,544 --> 02:19:19,285
[SPEAKER_01]: He joined on the hospital Wi-Fi.

2115
02:19:19,866 --> 02:19:20,866
[SPEAKER_01]: He's in chat right now.

2116
02:19:20,986 --> 02:19:21,267
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

2117
02:19:21,307 --> 02:19:22,268
[SPEAKER_03]: For free Wi-Fi?

2118
02:19:22,328 --> 02:19:23,048
[SPEAKER_03]: I second that.

2119
02:19:23,168 --> 02:19:24,629
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if he's listening or what.

2120
02:19:24,790 --> 02:19:30,074
[SPEAKER_01]: I just sent him a private message if I can call him, but I don't know if he can see.

2121
02:19:30,114 --> 02:19:30,715
[SPEAKER_01]: He probably can't hear.

2122
02:19:30,755 --> 02:19:31,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Free slow Wi-Fi.

2123
02:19:31,715 --> 02:19:33,217
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what you get when it's free Wi-Fi.

2124
02:19:33,257 --> 02:19:34,418
[SPEAKER_04]: It's slow Wi-Fi.

2125
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:38,580
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

2126
02:19:38,600 --> 02:19:39,981
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll see if we can call them or not.

2127
02:19:40,481 --> 02:19:41,101
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see.

2128
02:19:41,141 --> 02:19:42,681
[SPEAKER_01]: But for now, we're going to keep on moving with the news.

2129
02:19:44,362 --> 02:19:44,702
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.

2130
02:19:45,062 --> 02:19:50,384
[SPEAKER_01]: Metroid Other M. Now here's a Wii game that's going to be pretty hardcore for that person earlier.

2131
02:19:50,484 --> 02:19:52,224
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I'm excited about this game.

2132
02:19:52,264 --> 02:19:54,905
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm finally going to dust off the Wii after like six months of not playing it.

2133
02:19:55,325 --> 02:19:57,125
[SPEAKER_01]: This is kind of an interesting mode they're putting in the game.

2134
02:19:57,165 --> 02:20:00,386
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a theater mode in Metroid Other M. That's right.

2135
02:20:00,486 --> 02:20:05,788
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to just watch the movie Metroid Other M, you can do that.

2136
02:20:06,488 --> 02:20:06,848
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.

2137
02:20:07,108 --> 02:20:11,590
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a theater mode, according to one of the designers at Nintendo, Yoshio Sakamoto.

2138
02:20:11,890 --> 02:20:16,551
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a theater mode that lets you view all of the cutscenes linked together seamlessly as a single movie.

2139
02:20:17,131 --> 02:20:25,934
[SPEAKER_01]: We placed just as much weight on enjoying the story as we did on the action aspects of the game, but it's hard to fully communicate a storyline in a video game with just one playthrough.

2140
02:20:26,494 --> 02:20:32,899
[SPEAKER_01]: At the same time, though, it's asking a lot of players to beat the game twice to get it all, so that's where the idea for that mode came from.

2141
02:20:33,260 --> 02:20:37,803
[SPEAKER_01]: It lets you make a lot of discoveries, things you missed, or dialogue that makes more sense in retrospect.

2142
02:20:38,304 --> 02:20:40,545
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope it helps people understand the story better.

2143
02:20:41,546 --> 02:20:43,188
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting approach.

2144
02:20:43,968 --> 02:20:55,938
[SPEAKER_04]: That almost kind of reminds me of Final Fantasy X. They had the theater that was in Luka that you could go to and buy the individual cutscenes, which was really nice when you wanted to look at them all together.

2145
02:20:56,458 --> 02:21:00,240
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was going to say, people have been kind of doing this whole like cutscene movie thing for years.

2146
02:21:00,300 --> 02:21:08,763
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I'm pretty sure I could probably go on YouTube and just see, you know, nothing but cutscenes from some of the more recent Final Fantasy games and get a pretty good sense of what the story is all about.

2147
02:21:08,903 --> 02:21:13,225
[SPEAKER_01]: So kind of interesting that the game is now kind of officially endorsing that idea.

2148
02:21:13,285 --> 02:21:14,865
[SPEAKER_01]: But I like his reasoning behind it.

2149
02:21:15,205 --> 02:21:18,446
[SPEAKER_01]: He's just kind of like, you know what, you shouldn't have to beat the game twice to get everything.

2150
02:21:20,067 --> 02:21:46,015
[SPEAKER_01]: and you might kind of go it's nintendo easy mode just hit the button or whatever but you know i i i i'll give them a little credit i think something as epic as metroid is is worthy of a theater mode so is it cheating if you watch the whole movie first and then you play the game or yes but in my opinion that's no worse than going on the internet and reading the entire faq before you play the game good point yeah that's true i mean is it really any worse i

2151
02:21:48,429 --> 02:21:50,109
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm okay with it.

2152
02:21:50,149 --> 02:21:50,509
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.

2153
02:21:50,609 --> 02:21:53,290
[SPEAKER_01]: TigerClaw says, now the question is how long is the theater mode?

2154
02:21:53,370 --> 02:21:56,211
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually cutscenes, when you add them all together, they aren't usually an hour.

2155
02:21:56,492 --> 02:21:57,572
[SPEAKER_01]: They're saying two hours.

2156
02:21:58,292 --> 02:22:01,013
[SPEAKER_01]: Two hours is divided into chapters just like a DVD.

2157
02:22:01,454 --> 02:22:03,554
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just the cutscenes.

2158
02:22:04,014 --> 02:22:08,856
[SPEAKER_01]: There's actually pre-recorded gameplay that will be intertwined with it.

2159
02:22:10,057 --> 02:22:15,439
[SPEAKER_01]: Although I guess at one point they wanted to actually have recorded bits of you playing the game.

2160
02:22:15,839 --> 02:22:20,062
[SPEAKER_01]: that would then go into theater mode, but it's too big of a pain in the ass, basically, and I'll tell you why.

2161
02:22:20,102 --> 02:22:22,264
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because there's no decent storage on the Wii.

2162
02:22:22,804 --> 02:22:25,786
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though that's not what they're saying, I'm totally filling in the gaps there and making it up.

2163
02:22:26,267 --> 02:22:27,147
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gotta be the reason.

2164
02:22:27,307 --> 02:22:28,829
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't store that information.

2165
02:22:28,969 --> 02:22:30,610
[SPEAKER_06]: But it is watching an actual movie.

2166
02:22:30,990 --> 02:22:31,491
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty much.

2167
02:22:31,951 --> 02:22:32,711
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kinda cool.

2168
02:22:32,751 --> 02:22:34,313
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, how many people are perfectly content?

2169
02:22:34,613 --> 02:22:40,077
[SPEAKER_01]: Dark Sakura comes in here, and a lot of her gaming weeks usually are, I watched Dan play blank.

2170
02:22:40,597 --> 02:22:43,699
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of people that game by watching other people game.

2171
02:22:44,300 --> 02:22:44,420
Well,

2172
02:22:45,601 --> 02:22:52,626
[SPEAKER_02]: Part of it for me is that he'll play a lot of single player stuff and loves to just completely dominate the front room.

2173
02:22:54,427 --> 02:22:57,609
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually if I'm out there and he's playing something, it's just me watching him play something.

2174
02:22:57,629 --> 02:22:59,370
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially now since I had my hand surgery.

2175
02:23:00,711 --> 02:23:03,393
[SPEAKER_02]: I really get a lot of enjoyment out of just sitting down watching him play.

2176
02:23:03,493 --> 02:23:09,217
[SPEAKER_02]: I could sit and watch him play Grand Theft Horse for a while because it was very cinematic.

2177
02:23:10,217 --> 02:23:11,658
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't watching games boring?

2178
02:23:11,918 --> 02:23:12,038
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

2179
02:23:12,958 --> 02:23:13,759
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like watching a movie.

2180
02:23:14,359 --> 02:23:18,401
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a DVD that's all the cutscenes of Final Fantasy X-2.

2181
02:23:18,962 --> 02:23:21,583
[SPEAKER_01]: Alan will watch me PvP in WoW and he enjoys it.

2182
02:23:21,623 --> 02:23:24,064
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, he likes to play backseat driver too, but that's okay.

2183
02:23:24,524 --> 02:23:24,885
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fun.

2184
02:23:25,245 --> 02:23:25,865
[SPEAKER_01]: I like doing that.

2185
02:23:26,365 --> 02:23:26,685
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cool.

2186
02:23:28,686 --> 02:23:28,967
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

2187
02:23:30,848 --> 02:23:36,250
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, one more story and then I've got one more story as well and then we're going to get to the phones.

2188
02:23:36,270 --> 02:23:37,571
[SPEAKER_01]: 877-GAME-OLR in just a moment.

2189
02:23:37,811 --> 02:23:41,136
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of funny because this is something I downloaded and never got a chance to play.

2190
02:23:41,216 --> 02:23:42,678
[SPEAKER_02]: I was actually sitting here trying to play it.

2191
02:23:43,479 --> 02:23:48,826
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the Gorillas Escape to Plastic Beach, which is on iPad and iPhone.

2192
02:23:48,966 --> 02:23:49,467
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, nice.

2193
02:23:50,808 --> 02:23:51,249
[SPEAKER_02]: Good band.

2194
02:23:52,070 --> 02:23:52,851
[SPEAKER_06]: What's that about?

2195
02:23:53,692 --> 02:23:56,793
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's basically them trying to get to the plastic beach.

2196
02:23:58,634 --> 02:24:07,617
[SPEAKER_02]: You either play Murdoch, who flies on a doom glider, and he's trying to keep 2D from escaping.

2197
02:24:08,337 --> 02:24:08,657
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

2198
02:24:09,537 --> 02:24:10,478
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so it's...

2199
02:24:12,059 --> 02:24:16,661
[SPEAKER_02]: It's only $1.99 and you can get it as a browser game too.

2200
02:24:17,402 --> 02:24:19,683
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's pretty cute.

2201
02:24:19,783 --> 02:24:21,504
[SPEAKER_02]: Here, let me start it up again.

2202
02:24:21,764 --> 02:24:24,626
[SPEAKER_02]: I know this is fantastic because you won't probably be able to hear it very well.

2203
02:24:26,567 --> 02:24:27,828
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems interesting to me though.

2204
02:24:27,868 --> 02:24:33,171
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean usually these are the type of things you put out before an album comes out to kind of raise awareness about it.

2205
02:24:33,992 --> 02:24:36,593
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a little weird that this is coming out now.

2206
02:24:36,994 --> 02:24:37,574
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this picking up?

2207
02:24:39,996 --> 02:24:40,917
[SPEAKER_01]: Very quietly.

2208
02:24:40,977 --> 02:24:42,739
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of our listeners probably won't be able to hear it very well.

2209
02:24:44,020 --> 02:24:48,664
[SPEAKER_01]: Headphone people will probably be able to hear it okay, but speaker people probably not.

2210
02:24:50,105 --> 02:24:51,406
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to let you hear the beginning of it.

2211
02:24:53,368 --> 02:24:53,888
[SPEAKER_01]: It's loading.

2212
02:24:53,988 --> 02:24:54,969
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just beep beep boops.

2213
02:24:55,970 --> 02:24:56,751
[SPEAKER_01]: We can hear it there a little bit.

2214
02:25:02,597 --> 02:25:03,618
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I'm so British.

2215
02:25:24,403 --> 02:25:25,846
[SPEAKER_01]: Making more money off the characters.

2216
02:25:25,926 --> 02:25:26,547
[SPEAKER_01]: But hey, you know what?

2217
02:25:26,587 --> 02:25:31,217
[SPEAKER_01]: If they can have Britney Spears apps and sing along to Tap Tap Bieber or whatever those games are.

2218
02:25:32,499 --> 02:25:33,622
[SPEAKER_02]: She's such a cute little girl.

2219
02:25:33,962 --> 02:25:34,103
[SPEAKER_01]: Who?

2220
02:25:34,992 --> 02:25:41,138
[SPEAKER_01]: Justine Bieber That's awesome I was like, who are you talking about?

2221
02:25:41,298 --> 02:25:42,138
[SPEAKER_01]: Britney Spears?

2222
02:25:42,178 --> 02:25:56,171
[SPEAKER_02]: She's not a little girl anymore No, Justine Bieber Oh, Justine Bieber, okay She's the cutest little lesbian, I swear I'm a big Gorillaz fan, so this is so cute But man, looking at the iPad version though, I'd really love to play the iPad one

2223
02:25:57,358 --> 02:25:59,040
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like fun.

2224
02:25:59,580 --> 02:26:00,902
[SPEAKER_02]: Murdoch and his Doom Glider.

2225
02:26:01,382 --> 02:26:07,288
[SPEAKER_01]: One more story for you guys about a guy who now will have plenty of money to develop games on the iPad if he chooses to.

2226
02:26:07,809 --> 02:26:08,750
[SPEAKER_01]: Richard Garriott.

2227
02:26:09,230 --> 02:26:11,893
[SPEAKER_01]: He is the guy that made Ultima many, many years ago.

2228
02:26:11,933 --> 02:26:12,634
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember Ultima?

2229
02:26:13,134 --> 02:26:15,537
[SPEAKER_01]: It was epic epicness.

2230
02:26:15,577 --> 02:26:17,459
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I spent a lot of time playing Ultima Exodus.

2231
02:26:17,799 --> 02:26:17,919
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh.

2232
02:26:17,959 --> 02:26:18,059
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh.

2233
02:26:47,310 --> 02:26:48,130
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, here's the deal.

2234
02:26:48,810 --> 02:26:55,651
[SPEAKER_01]: Apparently, it came out today that out of the $47 million that Richard Garriott was seeking, he was actually awarded $28 million.

2235
02:26:55,692 --> 02:26:56,972
[SPEAKER_01]: Touching.

2236
02:26:57,252 --> 02:26:57,652
[SPEAKER_01]: Yikes.

2237
02:26:58,272 --> 02:26:59,392
[SPEAKER_01]: So, there you go.

2238
02:26:59,492 --> 02:27:06,853
[SPEAKER_01]: Apparently, they did find that there was some misrepresentation going on there and some contracts were breached and so forth.

2239
02:27:07,454 --> 02:27:08,554
[SPEAKER_01]: Very unfortunate.

2240
02:27:08,654 --> 02:27:14,075
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what's unfortunate, though, is that NCSoft makes a lot of... I hope they have good insurance, like legal insurance or something, because...

2241
02:27:15,775 --> 02:27:30,504
[SPEAKER_01]: they make a lot of MMOs and hopefully this won't hit them in the pockets really hard because they've got a lot of stuff under development at MCSoft right now this is going to suck that they're going to have to pay this guy out $28 million because they screwed up some things

2242
02:27:33,146 --> 02:27:34,867
[SPEAKER_01]: Tabula Rasa was an interesting game.

2243
02:27:34,927 --> 02:27:35,928
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of a bummer.

2244
02:27:36,048 --> 02:27:37,289
[SPEAKER_01]: It got kind of a crappy break.

2245
02:27:37,429 --> 02:27:37,769
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

2246
02:27:39,290 --> 02:27:40,711
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they just didn't promote it well enough.

2247
02:27:40,771 --> 02:27:41,051
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

2248
02:27:41,071 --> 02:27:43,953
[SPEAKER_01]: Or maybe just nothing was able to beat WoW at that time.

2249
02:27:44,013 --> 02:27:44,393
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

2250
02:27:45,073 --> 02:27:46,414
[SPEAKER_01]: But there it is.

2251
02:27:46,955 --> 02:27:47,235
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

2252
02:27:47,295 --> 02:27:55,520
[SPEAKER_01]: We are going to go ahead and open up the Skype line if you want to give us a call at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2253
02:27:55,680 --> 02:27:59,462
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead and give us a call and we'll take a few calls before we end the show.

2254
02:27:59,542 --> 02:28:00,363
[SPEAKER_01]: Close up shop tonight.

2255
02:28:02,003 --> 02:28:21,949
[SPEAKER_01]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username is Orange Lounge Radio I was hoping Loki would call us but I guess his Wi-Fi at the hospital is not so great he's not getting the private messages but that's okay he's got better things to do than talk to us honestly I know we're his friends and everything but he's got more important stuff tonight it's all good it's all good

2256
02:28:24,311 --> 02:28:26,892
[SPEAKER_01]: We should try to take the mics on the road and go see the baby.

2257
02:28:27,232 --> 02:28:27,832
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be fun.

2258
02:28:28,012 --> 02:28:29,673
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be absolutely cute.

2259
02:28:29,773 --> 02:28:33,033
[SPEAKER_01]: At the same time, everybody probably wants to be left the fuck alone right now.

2260
02:28:33,053 --> 02:28:39,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep in mind, for like the next month, all this baby is going to be able to see is Blur, Blur, Blur.

2261
02:28:39,275 --> 02:28:40,095
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, Red!

2262
02:28:40,395 --> 02:28:41,276
[SPEAKER_01]: But you like Blur.

2263
02:28:41,536 --> 02:28:42,296
[SPEAKER_01]: They're a great band.

2264
02:28:42,896 --> 02:28:43,116
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

2265
02:28:43,576 --> 02:28:43,856
[SPEAKER_11]: Dork.

2266
02:28:43,896 --> 02:28:44,677
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a phone call.

2267
02:28:44,757 --> 02:28:45,897
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2268
02:28:45,917 --> 02:28:46,317
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's this?

2269
02:28:47,117 --> 02:28:49,578
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, it's Ranma, back from Otakon 2010.

2270
02:28:49,998 --> 02:28:51,679
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Ranma, what's up?

2271
02:28:51,719 --> 02:28:52,099
[SPEAKER_11]: Sup?

2272
02:28:52,119 --> 02:28:52,159
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi.

2273
02:28:52,599 --> 02:28:53,239
[SPEAKER_01]: How you doing?

2274
02:28:54,697 --> 02:28:55,698
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm doing good.

2275
02:28:55,718 --> 02:28:59,002
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm a little tired, but it's a con.

2276
02:28:59,022 --> 02:28:59,682
[SPEAKER_11]: What do you expect?

2277
02:29:00,203 --> 02:29:01,304
[SPEAKER_02]: You didn't get con funk, did you?

2278
02:29:02,205 --> 02:29:03,546
[SPEAKER_11]: Cons are always exhausting.

2279
02:29:03,566 --> 02:29:07,991
[SPEAKER_11]: No, just so you know, the term con funk is officially dead.

2280
02:29:08,391 --> 02:29:10,373
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been replaced with hobo.

2281
02:29:11,274 --> 02:29:11,555
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

2282
02:29:11,575 --> 02:29:11,875
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

2283
02:29:12,215 --> 02:29:12,716
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

2284
02:29:13,036 --> 02:29:13,857
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't heard that before.

2285
02:29:13,877 --> 02:29:14,037
[SPEAKER_11]: Hobo.

2286
02:29:15,168 --> 02:29:15,488
[SPEAKER_11]: Hobo.

2287
02:29:15,688 --> 02:29:18,709
[SPEAKER_11]: Horrific otaku body odor.

2288
02:29:19,430 --> 02:29:20,070
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, God.

2289
02:29:20,510 --> 02:29:22,711
[SPEAKER_06]: A similar thing happens at game conventions, too.

2290
02:29:22,871 --> 02:29:23,551
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.

2291
02:29:23,591 --> 02:29:28,353
[SPEAKER_02]: Confunk, but keep in mind, Confunk also, though, encompasses con disease.

2292
02:29:30,614 --> 02:29:36,696
[SPEAKER_02]: Which was coined here in California, which was coined for quite a while here in California as the Dorbola.

2293
02:29:38,237 --> 02:29:40,138
[SPEAKER_02]: Because remember, we can track it back to Doreen.

2294
02:29:41,747 --> 02:29:42,647
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember that, yes.

2295
02:29:43,088 --> 02:29:43,428
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway.

2296
02:29:43,448 --> 02:29:44,008
[SPEAKER_02]: He got married.

2297
02:29:44,588 --> 02:29:45,329
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, I know.

2298
02:29:46,209 --> 02:29:48,190
[SPEAKER_01]: How was the con, Ranma?

2299
02:29:49,551 --> 02:29:53,132
[SPEAKER_11]: It was good, despite some of the couple of things that happened this weekend.

2300
02:29:53,152 --> 02:29:58,195
[SPEAKER_11]: I had fun, my staff had fun, and I saw an ITG3 machine there.

2301
02:30:00,050 --> 02:30:01,191
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait, they made an In The Groove 3?

2302
02:30:01,291 --> 02:30:03,914
[SPEAKER_11]: There was an In The Groove 3 machine.

2303
02:30:04,114 --> 02:30:07,899
[SPEAKER_11]: It wasn't on, so I don't know what was on it.

2304
02:30:07,939 --> 02:30:10,421
[SPEAKER_11]: My game report, I'll have to ask her what was on the machine.

2305
02:30:10,581 --> 02:30:14,786
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't they get sued to all hell and they can't make any more?

2306
02:30:15,467 --> 02:30:17,169
[SPEAKER_01]: Was there a third mix officially?

2307
02:30:18,943 --> 02:30:19,863
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

2308
02:30:19,883 --> 02:30:22,924
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it was in process before it got shut down.

2309
02:30:23,004 --> 02:30:26,645
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, maybe someone snuck it out and threw it onto a machine or something.

2310
02:30:26,745 --> 02:30:29,026
[SPEAKER_11]: I do have a picture of the unit.

2311
02:30:29,126 --> 02:30:31,006
[SPEAKER_11]: A purposefully leaked prototype.

2312
02:30:31,046 --> 02:30:31,807
[SPEAKER_01]: You said unit.

2313
02:30:31,907 --> 02:30:35,168
[SPEAKER_01]: Hitstun in chat says ITG3 is a mod of ITG2.

2314
02:30:35,228 --> 02:30:37,088
[SPEAKER_01]: That wouldn't surprise me either, actually.

2315
02:30:37,448 --> 02:30:38,208
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.

2316
02:30:38,789 --> 02:30:40,809
[SPEAKER_11]: And oddly enough, there was no DDR machines there.

2317
02:30:40,889 --> 02:30:44,910
[SPEAKER_11]: It was just that one ITG machine and two Pump It Up Pro 2 machines.

2318
02:30:45,530 --> 02:30:45,931
[SPEAKER_11]: Interesting.

2319
02:30:46,691 --> 02:30:47,331
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, very.

2320
02:30:48,632 --> 02:30:49,813
[SPEAKER_01]: What else in the gaming world?

2321
02:30:50,994 --> 02:30:55,017
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I didn't cover too much of the gaming because I was more covering everything else.

2322
02:30:55,037 --> 02:30:57,579
[SPEAKER_11]: But I can tell you about gaming cosplays.

2323
02:30:57,899 --> 02:30:58,960
[SPEAKER_11]: I can tell you this much.

2324
02:30:59,320 --> 02:31:05,164
[SPEAKER_11]: Every year when a Final Fantasy game comes out, everybody and their mother does cosplays.

2325
02:31:05,224 --> 02:31:09,307
[SPEAKER_11]: And for the longest time, the big cosplay was always Final Fantasy VII.

2326
02:31:09,968 --> 02:31:10,849
[SPEAKER_11]: I can tell you this right now.

2327
02:31:10,869 --> 02:31:15,132
[SPEAKER_11]: There was about 12 to 13 Final Fantasy cosplayers.

2328
02:31:16,192 --> 02:31:17,674
[SPEAKER_11]: Six to seven of them were from XIII.

2329
02:31:19,426 --> 02:31:19,846
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

2330
02:31:19,906 --> 02:31:21,968
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, 13's very cosplayable.

2331
02:31:23,168 --> 02:31:23,648
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?

2332
02:31:23,668 --> 02:31:27,070
[SPEAKER_11]: It is, but I don't think it really went over well with a lot of the fans.

2333
02:31:27,090 --> 02:31:29,512
[SPEAKER_11]: Because from what I've talked to a lot of people, at first they love 13.

2334
02:31:29,552 --> 02:31:31,533
[SPEAKER_11]: They're like, what the shit is this?

2335
02:31:37,056 --> 02:31:37,376
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

2336
02:31:37,416 --> 02:31:38,357
[SPEAKER_01]: I still like 13.

2337
02:31:38,417 --> 02:31:39,938
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what y'all's problem is, but whatever.

2338
02:31:40,618 --> 02:31:42,259
[SPEAKER_11]: I enjoy 13 too, you know.

2339
02:31:43,120 --> 02:31:44,520
[SPEAKER_11]: The battle system just kind of threw me.

2340
02:31:45,441 --> 02:31:46,802
[SPEAKER_11]: That's probably what it is.

2341
02:31:48,578 --> 02:32:06,438
[SPEAKER_01]: gotcha someone was supposed to lend me their copy I keep forgetting I'm sorry you have to like text me right before a show one night when I'm not in the bay so let's see what else do I want to ask you about the con well quickly any really cool like events even anime style or whatever what were some memorable moments of the con

2342
02:32:07,575 --> 02:32:14,520
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, my best memorable moment was the concert I went to this afternoon.

2343
02:32:14,640 --> 02:32:18,243
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a Japanese hip-hop group called Homei Kazoku.

2344
02:32:19,004 --> 02:32:28,551
[SPEAKER_11]: The best way I can describe them is, if you remember hip-hop rap music from the 80s when it was good, that take it to the next level.

2345
02:32:30,012 --> 02:32:30,452
[SPEAKER_11]: I see.

2346
02:32:32,053 --> 02:32:33,054
[SPEAKER_11]: As good as Dragon Ash?

2347
02:32:34,671 --> 02:32:36,653
[SPEAKER_11]: Honestly, I think they're better than Dragon Ash.

2348
02:32:36,973 --> 02:32:37,233
[SPEAKER_11]: Really?

2349
02:32:37,433 --> 02:32:38,054
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, snap.

2350
02:32:38,814 --> 02:32:45,120
[SPEAKER_11]: And generally, when a lot of Japanese artists come over, they always have a little bit of trouble speaking English to the fans.

2351
02:32:46,241 --> 02:32:50,264
[SPEAKER_11]: They were speaking 100% English.

2352
02:32:50,844 --> 02:32:52,946
[SPEAKER_11]: No stuttering, no rough edges.

2353
02:32:53,006 --> 02:32:55,088
[SPEAKER_11]: It was just straight, clear, right across the board.

2354
02:32:55,188 --> 02:33:00,792
[SPEAKER_11]: And I've been to a lot of J-rock, J-pop concerts at Otakon and other conventions.

2355
02:33:02,660 --> 02:33:06,162
[SPEAKER_11]: At this concert, everybody was on their feet going nuts.

2356
02:33:06,282 --> 02:33:09,304
[SPEAKER_11]: I have never seen a crowd this wild.

2357
02:33:10,104 --> 02:33:10,444
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.

2358
02:33:12,045 --> 02:33:14,326
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Ranma, we gotta wrap up so we can get more calls.

2359
02:33:14,346 --> 02:33:15,767
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have anything else you want to say about the con?

2360
02:33:16,647 --> 02:33:19,028
[SPEAKER_11]: There was a fire at the convention center.

2361
02:33:19,168 --> 02:33:19,408
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

2362
02:33:20,389 --> 02:33:20,629
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

2363
02:33:21,589 --> 02:33:22,670
[SPEAKER_01]: Did somebody say fire?

2364
02:33:41,869 --> 02:33:43,189
[SPEAKER_01]: So what'd you say on fire, Ranma?

2365
02:33:44,370 --> 02:33:44,730
[SPEAKER_11]: Rob?

2366
02:33:45,610 --> 02:33:45,850
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

2367
02:33:46,991 --> 02:33:47,891
[SPEAKER_11]: You're a dick.

2368
02:33:48,671 --> 02:33:49,972
[SPEAKER_11]: But you know what?

2369
02:33:50,012 --> 02:33:54,553
[SPEAKER_11]: I still love you.

2370
02:33:56,294 --> 02:33:57,994
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, like, not everybody gets that joke, Ranma.

2371
02:33:58,294 --> 02:34:00,235
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, well, tell us about the fire real quick.

2372
02:34:01,082 --> 02:34:01,723
[SPEAKER_11]: What a con-ruiner.

2373
02:34:19,622 --> 02:34:21,543
[SPEAKER_11]: and at least it wasn't snowing outside.

2374
02:34:23,124 --> 02:34:31,708
[SPEAKER_11]: And talking to some people, I kind of figured out who started the grease fire and I think only me and Jamie will catch this joke as I post a link to the comment in the chat.

2375
02:34:31,748 --> 02:34:33,028
[SPEAKER_11]: I did, I did, I did.

2376
02:34:33,048 --> 02:34:35,089
[SPEAKER_01]: I like what Amaze Satsuma says in our chat room.

2377
02:34:35,389 --> 02:34:39,311
[SPEAKER_01]: Con's on fire.

2378
02:34:39,411 --> 02:34:40,131
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice, I like that.

2379
02:34:41,472 --> 02:34:43,593
[SPEAKER_01]: I can be the theme song for when your con gets set on fire.

2380
02:34:44,133 --> 02:34:45,734
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, that's it.

2381
02:34:45,814 --> 02:34:47,655
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to hang up on you now so we can take more calls.

2382
02:34:47,795 --> 02:34:48,255
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a good night.

2383
02:34:49,096 --> 02:34:49,556
[SPEAKER_01]: Good night.

2384
02:34:49,756 --> 02:34:50,056
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye.

2385
02:34:51,657 --> 02:34:53,278
[SPEAKER_12]: Dude, fuck GameStop.

2386
02:34:53,298 --> 02:34:54,758
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to take another call real quick.

2387
02:34:55,319 --> 02:34:57,040
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I want to know more about why you're angry.

2388
02:34:57,340 --> 02:34:58,320
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2389
02:34:58,340 --> 02:34:58,700
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's this?

2390
02:35:00,381 --> 02:35:01,542
[SPEAKER_10]: This is Kane IM.

2391
02:35:02,482 --> 02:35:03,263
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, what was that?

2392
02:35:04,343 --> 02:35:05,304
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Kane IM.

2393
02:35:06,064 --> 02:35:07,025
[SPEAKER_10]: Kane IM.

2394
02:35:08,225 --> 02:35:08,625
[SPEAKER_01]: I got it.

2395
02:35:08,685 --> 02:35:09,446
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, Kane IM?

2396
02:35:11,292 --> 02:35:11,832
[SPEAKER_10]: Not much.

2397
02:35:12,052 --> 02:35:16,274
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, I did find a way to run the live show off my phone.

2398
02:35:16,754 --> 02:35:19,295
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I do appreciate your guys' help.

2399
02:35:19,635 --> 02:35:24,657
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, he's the same guy who emailed in about getting the... Okay, so what did you end up using?

2400
02:35:27,218 --> 02:35:28,498
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a shoutcast program.

2401
02:35:28,538 --> 02:35:30,018
[SPEAKER_10]: I did a little bit of searching online.

2402
02:35:33,380 --> 02:35:35,000
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm glad you were able to find something.

2403
02:35:35,040 --> 02:35:36,501
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't call in because I wanted to know...

2404
02:35:38,066 --> 02:35:41,475
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you guys have any suggestions on how to get an IRC program for my phone?

2405
02:35:45,629 --> 02:35:47,850
[SPEAKER_10]: so that I can join in on the chat.

2406
02:35:48,110 --> 02:35:50,432
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that there is one for iPhone.

2407
02:35:50,572 --> 02:35:51,612
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know about the Droid.

2408
02:35:51,672 --> 02:35:58,636
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate to say iPhone again, but again, that All Games app, whenever it comes back, because I imagine its disappearance is only temporary, you can get on IRC.

2409
02:35:58,656 --> 02:35:59,557
[SPEAKER_01]: The Droid has a browser, right?

2410
02:35:59,657 --> 02:36:00,657
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a PSP?

2411
02:36:01,018 --> 02:36:01,278
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

2412
02:36:01,738 --> 02:36:09,502
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, if you have a PSP, go to olrpsp.com and you can do the chat and the stream all from the PSP.

2413
02:36:10,623 --> 02:36:14,385
[SPEAKER_10]: Unfortunately, I'm a truck driver and Wi-Fi is kind of scarce.

2414
02:36:14,727 --> 02:36:15,067
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

2415
02:36:15,087 --> 02:36:15,267
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

2416
02:36:37,215 --> 02:36:37,976
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure.

2417
02:36:38,216 --> 02:36:46,838
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm opening up to our own chatters right now to see if they have any suggestions at chat.orangeloungeradio.com I guess just try to search for something IRC.

2418
02:36:47,018 --> 02:36:55,280
[SPEAKER_01]: Because with any IRC client, you should be able to connect to the Game Surge Network, which is the network we're on.

2419
02:36:55,620 --> 02:36:57,801
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's just channel Orange Lounge.

2420
02:36:58,441 --> 02:37:01,763
[SPEAKER_01]: Any IRC client can get to our room.

2421
02:37:01,843 --> 02:37:04,165
[SPEAKER_01]: Here in studio, we use MIRC.

2422
02:37:04,425 --> 02:37:07,447
[SPEAKER_01]: As Toa Gak in our chat says, IRC is IRC is IRC, right?

2423
02:37:08,087 --> 02:37:09,668
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that's correct.

2424
02:37:10,869 --> 02:37:17,153
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, I don't know what IRC clients exist on that platform, but you have to run a search and maybe Google can tell you.

2425
02:37:18,734 --> 02:37:19,334
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, thanks.

2426
02:37:19,994 --> 02:37:21,115
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, well, good luck to you.

2427
02:37:21,956 --> 02:37:24,137
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, any games that you've been playing while you've been out on the road?

2428
02:37:26,573 --> 02:37:31,897
[SPEAKER_10]: I just got Naughty Bear and my one sinful pleasure is Harvest Moon.

2429
02:37:32,077 --> 02:37:32,917
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you like Naughty Bear?

2430
02:37:32,937 --> 02:37:33,998
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I really want to play it.

2431
02:37:35,980 --> 02:37:38,161
[SPEAKER_10]: Picture Manhunt with teddy bears.

2432
02:37:38,641 --> 02:37:40,503
[SPEAKER_10]: That's about all it is.

2433
02:37:40,563 --> 02:37:41,704
[SPEAKER_10]: It's good for a giggle.

2434
02:37:41,804 --> 02:37:42,524
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the thing, though.

2435
02:37:42,584 --> 02:37:43,765
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds awesome.

2436
02:37:44,065 --> 02:37:48,188
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember when we were looking at the previews here in studio, we were so excited and everything else.

2437
02:37:48,348 --> 02:37:51,230
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've heard the game is real shit.

2438
02:37:51,351 --> 02:37:53,312
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, it's getting terrible reviews.

2439
02:37:53,572 --> 02:37:54,553
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm kind of, you know...

2440
02:37:54,913 --> 02:37:59,415
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that reviewers necessarily know everything, but it did kind of give me pause.

2441
02:37:59,475 --> 02:38:02,456
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, wow, this game is doing really bad in the reviews.

2442
02:38:03,677 --> 02:38:06,998
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you see that, why that's happening, or do you think it's totally unfounded?

2443
02:38:08,559 --> 02:38:10,259
[SPEAKER_10]: The controls are a bit clunky.

2444
02:38:10,319 --> 02:38:15,041
[SPEAKER_10]: The camera doesn't seem to want to cooperate with you.

2445
02:38:16,782 --> 02:38:23,765
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I'll wait if you really want to play it until either someone else buys it, or we play it bargain-based.

2446
02:38:25,231 --> 02:38:26,372
[SPEAKER_01]: I can... Maybe I'll do that.

2447
02:38:26,432 --> 02:38:27,493
[SPEAKER_01]: Bargain Basement then.

2448
02:38:28,154 --> 02:38:28,454
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

2449
02:38:28,494 --> 02:38:30,596
[SPEAKER_01]: It's too bad they can't get some of those basic things right.

2450
02:38:30,636 --> 02:38:32,318
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like they don't even play the game or something.

2451
02:38:32,378 --> 02:38:32,718
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

2452
02:38:33,188 --> 02:38:35,689
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, then, in about, you know, a couple of months, I might just pick it up.

2453
02:38:37,290 --> 02:38:38,451
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait, I thought you were an Xbox owner.

2454
02:38:39,471 --> 02:38:43,553
[SPEAKER_04]: That doesn't mean I can't go over to somebody's house and play.

2455
02:38:43,573 --> 02:38:45,514
[SPEAKER_04]: That's usually where I get all my gaming experiences.

2456
02:38:45,574 --> 02:38:49,376
[SPEAKER_04]: I usually have some... I know a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy who owns a 360.

2457
02:38:49,416 --> 02:38:50,777
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

2458
02:38:51,777 --> 02:38:58,020
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, well, KaneIM, we're going to let you get back to your thing, but thanks so much for the call, and good luck with the mobile phone quest.

2459
02:38:58,040 --> 02:38:59,101
[SPEAKER_01]: We appreciate you trying so hard.

2460
02:39:00,521 --> 02:39:01,102
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, no problem.

2461
02:39:01,122 --> 02:39:04,005
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys try and keep, you know, do what you're doing and take it easy.

2462
02:39:04,185 --> 02:39:05,126
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you very much.

2463
02:39:05,266 --> 02:39:05,987
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep on trucking.

2464
02:39:06,348 --> 02:39:06,628
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

2465
02:39:07,929 --> 02:39:08,150
Bye.

2466
02:39:08,270 --> 02:39:09,711
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always wanted to say that to a truck driver.

2467
02:39:09,792 --> 02:39:10,072
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

2468
02:39:12,423 --> 02:39:14,044
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, anyhow, let's see.

2469
02:39:14,124 --> 02:39:21,748
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking at chat and some folks clarifying some things about the OLR PSP and HitStun is saying, OLR PSP's chat is a shout box, not an IRC chat.

2470
02:39:21,788 --> 02:39:22,469
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is correct.

2471
02:39:22,769 --> 02:39:25,371
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no IRC clients that work on PSP right now.

2472
02:39:25,751 --> 02:39:29,813
[SPEAKER_01]: Loki tried to get that to happen and he couldn't because you're absolutely right.

2473
02:39:29,913 --> 02:39:31,334
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing that works right now.

2474
02:39:31,554 --> 02:39:32,014
[SPEAKER_01]: So there it is.

2475
02:39:33,175 --> 02:39:34,276
[SPEAKER_01]: We can do at least one more call.

2476
02:39:34,336 --> 02:39:35,256
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, you're on Orange Silence Radio.

2477
02:39:35,276 --> 02:39:35,617
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's this?

2478
02:39:37,009 --> 02:39:40,471
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, hello there, you all are.

2479
02:39:40,491 --> 02:39:44,133
[SPEAKER_01]: This is that one, Aki Ripper, from Sweden.

2480
02:39:44,253 --> 02:39:45,834
[SPEAKER_01]: Aki Ripper.

2481
02:39:45,994 --> 02:39:46,734
[SPEAKER_01]: From Sweden.

2482
02:39:46,794 --> 02:39:47,915
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the other Swede.

2483
02:39:47,995 --> 02:39:49,575
[SPEAKER_01]: It's another Battle of the Swedes night.

2484
02:39:49,635 --> 02:39:50,036
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.

2485
02:39:50,056 --> 02:39:51,877
[SPEAKER_01]: We had our emailer, and now we have Aki Ripper.

2486
02:39:52,257 --> 02:39:55,899
[SPEAKER_01]: No, there's always room for at least two Swedish people.

2487
02:39:55,939 --> 02:39:56,319
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?

2488
02:39:56,379 --> 02:39:59,240
[SPEAKER_01]: If a third Swedish person wanted to listen, I would welcome them, too.

2489
02:39:59,961 --> 02:40:01,601
[SPEAKER_08]: What is on your mind?

2490
02:40:01,862 --> 02:40:04,283
[SPEAKER_01]: And if there were four, we could make our own version of ABBA.

2491
02:40:04,623 --> 02:40:06,024
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Aki Ripper, what's on your mind?

2492
02:40:07,064 --> 02:40:07,385
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah?

2493
02:40:08,025 --> 02:40:08,746
[SPEAKER_01]: What the funk?

2494
02:40:09,426 --> 02:40:09,786
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn it.

2495
02:40:10,687 --> 02:40:11,268
[SPEAKER_09]: What's on your mind?

2496
02:40:11,528 --> 02:40:11,808
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello?

2497
02:40:13,069 --> 02:40:13,429
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

2498
02:40:13,649 --> 02:40:13,930
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello?

2499
02:40:14,050 --> 02:40:14,770
[SPEAKER_01]: What's on your mind?

2500
02:40:17,392 --> 02:40:24,798
[SPEAKER_09]: I rambled on on the network one time and well, Stormcatcher 2 could be wonderful if I could play it.

2501
02:40:25,799 --> 02:40:26,279
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh no.

2502
02:40:26,719 --> 02:40:27,980
[SPEAKER_01]: Did they lock Sweden out?

2503
02:40:28,841 --> 02:40:29,321
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no.

2504
02:40:29,602 --> 02:40:33,404
[SPEAKER_09]: The thing is that I can't play it due to the thing that Battle.net

2505
02:40:36,048 --> 02:40:49,273
[SPEAKER_09]: refused to accept that I have tapped in my key in Battle.net and said it's listed, but when I launched the game and said like, no, you do not have a StarCraft key associated with your Battle.net account.

2506
02:40:50,333 --> 02:40:56,595
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, it's all listed there, but the game refuses to say yes or something.

2507
02:40:58,126 --> 02:41:00,587
[SPEAKER_01]: We have an angry, angry Swede on the show tonight.

2508
02:41:00,607 --> 02:41:03,387
[SPEAKER_01]: You hear that anger in his voice.

2509
02:41:03,467 --> 02:41:06,588
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm quite pissed in that regard.

2510
02:41:08,948 --> 02:41:15,610
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, around 900 Swedish crowns, which is like... I'm going to be rough.

2511
02:41:16,770 --> 02:41:18,710
[SPEAKER_09]: How much, by the way, is the collector's edition?

2512
02:41:18,730 --> 02:41:21,131
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, it's the collector's edition.

2513
02:41:21,151 --> 02:41:21,131
$99.

2514
02:41:21,371 --> 02:41:22,351
[SPEAKER_01]: How much you pay it in...

2515
02:41:26,624 --> 02:41:36,392
[SPEAKER_09]: And they can do it all, but it's somewhere around, well, it's somewhere around 90 bucks or even less.

2516
02:41:36,792 --> 02:41:37,032
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

2517
02:41:37,493 --> 02:41:40,315
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, here's a suggestion.

2518
02:41:40,355 --> 02:41:41,235
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even know if this works.

2519
02:41:41,256 --> 02:41:42,136
[SPEAKER_01]: You've probably already done this.

2520
02:41:42,557 --> 02:41:48,381
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you logged on to the web portal, going on to battle.net on the web and making sure that the game is associated there?

2521
02:41:48,741 --> 02:41:51,363
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, well, it's listed there.

2522
02:41:52,805 --> 02:41:55,447
[SPEAKER_09]: And, well, the thing is that, well, I've...

2523
02:41:57,454 --> 02:41:58,834
[SPEAKER_09]: And here's the other thing, though.

2524
02:42:01,336 --> 02:42:05,199
[SPEAKER_09]: The workaround that I'm trying to do is, well, change password.

2525
02:42:05,519 --> 02:42:13,344
[SPEAKER_09]: If word for the following fact that I have forgotten my, like, hidden question... Uh-oh.

2526
02:42:13,924 --> 02:42:14,805
[SPEAKER_09]: That's my problem.

2527
02:42:15,045 --> 02:42:20,168
[SPEAKER_09]: So, and I've... And, well, I've tried... Tried calling the...

2528
02:42:23,658 --> 02:42:26,139
[SPEAKER_09]: calling Blizzard about it, but here's the thing, though.

2529
02:42:26,319 --> 02:42:30,500
[SPEAKER_09]: Trying to call the Blizzard line around these parts apparently seems quite hard.

2530
02:42:31,040 --> 02:42:47,184
[SPEAKER_09]: And the irony is that I've managed to call the US one when I had problems with the... when I had problems at the time when I was playing World of Warcraft on US servers, then I got straight along.

2531
02:42:47,664 --> 02:42:48,304
[SPEAKER_09]: And now it's like...

2532
02:42:49,595 --> 02:42:52,217
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, you're out of luck or something.

2533
02:42:52,377 --> 02:42:53,038
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, well, anyway.

2534
02:42:53,278 --> 02:42:55,680
[SPEAKER_01]: Has your WoW account been inactive for some time?

2535
02:42:56,701 --> 02:43:01,745
[SPEAKER_09]: My WoW account, both of my WoW accounts have been inactive for like...

2536
02:43:04,938 --> 02:43:07,119
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you have an authenticator on that account?

2537
02:43:07,619 --> 02:43:08,779
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I did not.

2538
02:43:09,060 --> 02:43:16,102
[SPEAKER_09]: Because the authenticator, when I played the authenticator, wasn't released yet.

2539
02:43:16,423 --> 02:43:21,064
[SPEAKER_01]: It is possible, and I don't know, but it's possible that your account got hacked.

2540
02:43:21,244 --> 02:43:30,268
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I have heard of people that even though they had inactive Warcraft accounts, that some people would go in there and reactivate them to get access to the characters.

2541
02:43:30,328 --> 02:43:31,949
[SPEAKER_01]: It's crazy, crazy stuff.

2542
02:43:32,549 --> 02:43:35,910
[SPEAKER_01]: Just hypothesizing that that could be what's screwing with you over there.

2543
02:43:36,010 --> 02:43:41,452
[SPEAKER_01]: So, definitely, you're going to have to keep on Blizzard and, I guess, email if nothing else.

2544
02:43:41,472 --> 02:43:42,192
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

2545
02:43:42,392 --> 02:43:45,173
[SPEAKER_09]: I will have to call them or something.

2546
02:43:45,753 --> 02:44:02,058
[SPEAKER_09]: Because, well, but one of the problems that I have also is that, well, if I'm right, to be able to identify, well, I'm going to have to go find... The problem is also is that I need to find a scanner

2547
02:44:03,255 --> 02:44:09,800
[SPEAKER_09]: or the scanner because I need to scan in my passport or something.

2548
02:44:11,549 --> 02:44:21,092
[SPEAKER_09]: to send, well, to basically, like, made in a file and send it to them and say that, yes, this is me, of sorts.

2549
02:44:21,352 --> 02:44:22,413
[SPEAKER_01]: What a pain.

2550
02:44:22,453 --> 02:44:24,373
[SPEAKER_01]: Or are you just going to have to give him the angry Swede?

2551
02:44:24,714 --> 02:44:27,354
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds like this angry Swede's quite justified in his anger.

2552
02:44:27,394 --> 02:44:29,555
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I wish you the best.

2553
02:44:29,595 --> 02:44:31,256
[SPEAKER_09]: I wish there was a magic wand.

2554
02:44:31,336 --> 02:44:33,816
[SPEAKER_09]: In that regard, I am quite pissed.

2555
02:44:34,137 --> 02:44:37,438
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, and also, because, well, and also, because, well...

2556
02:44:39,289 --> 02:44:53,128
[SPEAKER_09]: StarCraft 2, and here's the other thing though, in a kind of way, I already know what happens in, because also the thing is, playing StarCraft, I wasn't that hyped for StarCraft 2 in a kind of way anyway, since, uh,

2557
02:44:53,709 --> 02:45:03,811
[SPEAKER_09]: The thing that I did is that since I got the Collector's Edition, you have this special DVD of sorts when you get all the video frequencies from the game.

2558
02:45:03,831 --> 02:45:06,112
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm all like, yeah, let's watch this.

2559
02:45:06,192 --> 02:45:09,632
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah, you just got spoiled the whole game.

2560
02:45:11,673 --> 02:45:17,234
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, here's the other thing, though, and even more fun, is that, well, if I...

2561
02:45:18,121 --> 02:45:42,391
[SPEAKER_09]: and especially actually in a kind of way since I'm like one of those players that played through the first StarCraft game were playing like code power overwhelming yes please which was that well god mode activated well Aki Ripper I wish I could fix it for you but it sounds like you're just gonna have to keep on Blizzard customer support but do let us know what happens okay buddy

2562
02:45:43,191 --> 02:45:45,152
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I'll keep you updated.

2563
02:45:45,192 --> 02:45:46,932
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, I hope you can get to the Zerging soon.

2564
02:45:47,132 --> 02:45:47,892
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, hang in there.

2565
02:45:48,552 --> 02:45:49,193
[SPEAKER_01]: Take care, buddy.

2566
02:45:49,773 --> 02:45:50,053
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye.

2567
02:45:51,453 --> 02:45:52,373
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, poor guy.

2568
02:45:53,334 --> 02:45:55,274
[SPEAKER_01]: But hey, tough lesson for everybody.

2569
02:45:55,454 --> 02:45:57,435
[SPEAKER_01]: Learn at Ake Ripper's expense.

2570
02:45:57,595 --> 02:45:59,695
[SPEAKER_01]: Learn at the expense of the Swedes.

2571
02:46:00,415 --> 02:46:04,696
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't forget your security question, because that sucks when that happens.

2572
02:46:04,756 --> 02:46:10,638
[SPEAKER_01]: You gotta be very careful with that stuff, so make sure you will be able to remember it later on, or else you're gonna have

[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, I'm going to ask for your final thought tonight.

2639
02:48:54,616 --> 02:48:55,517

2640
02:48:59,260 --> 02:49:01,423
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura deserves our full sympathy.

2641
02:49:02,083 --> 02:49:02,944
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been a rough week.

[SPEAKER_02]: You need a hug.

2644
02:49:05,367 --> 02:49:05,867
[SPEAKER_02]: And a cookie.

2645
02:49:06,328 --> 02:49:07,249
[SPEAKER_01]: And a pony.

2646
02:49:07,629 --> 02:49:08,150
[SPEAKER_01]: And a dinner.

2647
02:49:08,370 --> 02:49:10,072

2648
02:49:10,152 --> 02:49:11,393
[SPEAKER_01]: Gary, do you have a final thought tonight?

2649
02:49:13,879 --> 02:49:18,283
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been too long since I've done any console game or any computer game.

2650
02:49:18,303 --> 02:49:19,223
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to get back into it.

2651
02:49:19,243 --> 02:49:23,467
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks like things have taken quantum leaps from the last time I did this seriously.

2652
02:49:24,147 --> 02:49:27,290
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw the screenshots of Arkham Asylum and was blown away.

2653
02:49:27,911 --> 02:49:28,951
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad we could inspire you.

2654
02:49:29,252 --> 02:49:29,512

02:49:30,613 --> 02:49:31,854
[SPEAKER_01]: Milo, you have a final thought tonight?

2656
02:49:32,054 --> 02:49:47,851
[SPEAKER_01]: DC Online Wow I'm totally going to be there too Can't wait And my final thought is I think Pinkberry would make it all better I've never been there It's really good But sadly it's Sunday and they're not going to be open But anyway, tomorrow

2657
02:49:48,311 --> 02:49:49,452

02:49:50,574 --> 02:49:52,956
[SPEAKER_01]: We will be back here next week to do it all over again.

2660
02:49:52,996 --> 02:50:02,206
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, Loki's going to be out for a little while longer, but hey, DarkSakura and I are perfectly capable of holding down the fort, so tune in next week to see what the antics bring, and I've got duct tape.

2661
02:50:02,446 --> 02:50:07,352
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have a co-host next week to fill in for Loki, so more on that next week.

02:50:07,372 --> 02:50:09,114
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see you next week here at Orange Lounge Radio.

2663

[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I almost forgot.

2664
02:50:11,696 --> 02:50:14,578
[SPEAKER_01]: If you did enjoy our show, please tell two people about the show.

2665
02:50:14,618 --> 02:50:18,221
[SPEAKER_01]: Help us spread the word because we're not a multi-million dollar organization.

2666
02:50:18,261 --> 02:50:21,444
[SPEAKER_01]: We're excited when we have $10 in the budget to spend on a Facebook ad.

2667
02:50:22,004 --> 02:50:25,527
[SPEAKER_01]: So we really, really can use your guys' help in helping us spread the word of Orange Launch Radio.

2668
