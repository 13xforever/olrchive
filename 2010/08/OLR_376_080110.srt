00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,180
Tonight, August 1st, 2010, a big MMO plans a free-to-play model, Valve accidentally

2
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:29,980
bans 12,000 players, and the creator of Ultima wins $28 million from his former company.

3
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:35,600
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge

4
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,600
Radio.

5
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,320
We are that program dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer

6
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,320
lifestyle.

7
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,980
We are that show where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:45,980
My name is Rob Roberts.

9
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:50,080
I'll be joining you over the next few hours here at All Games Radio, where we tape live

10
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:55,080
every Sunday night, www.allgames.com, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, 6 o'clock

11
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,400
Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.

12
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,740
Boy, we say a lot in this intro.

13
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:02,760
The consoling voice over there in the corner, also joining us over the next few hours, Dark

14
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,760
Sakura, Jamie Summers.

15
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,800
We're also into game and meat, because elk is really tasty.

16
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:11,480
I didn't know you were dining on meat this week.

17
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:15,360
Every so often I dine on the meat, but I do not necessarily chow on the cow, and I definitely

18
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,360
don't dine on the swine.

19
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,480
Chow on the cow and dine on the swine, alright.

20
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,280
Remember, I got that from Danielle back in the day.

21
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,280
Oh my gosh.

22
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,280
Yep.

23
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,280
Wow.

24
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,720
I don't chow on cow and I don't dine on swine.

25
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,280
She was crazier than Sarah Palin.

26
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,280
Alright.

27
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,280
Um.

28
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,280
Look.

29
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,920
Let me, let me move on to introducing guests, on to happier topics.

30
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,040
Let's talk about Loki is not here tonight.

31
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:44,400
Loki's not here, because this is the day that we knew was going to be coming for some time.

32
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,880
Loki's going to be out for a few shows, because Loki, Miss Loki, went into labor this morning

33
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,060
at 11 a.m.

34
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,060
That's all we know.

35
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,640
We don't have a lot of updates other than that.

36
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,920
The baby is not here, or at least the arrival has not been announced on Facebook, but if

37
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:00,400
I were Loki, I would not be running to Facebook to announce the birth first thing.

38
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:07,320
My guess is that they do have a tiny one right now, who is currently doing a lot of sleeping,

39
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,840
as is mommy.

40
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:14,800
So during sleep time, we should start seeing the messages, because the, the, the body goes

41
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,360
through quite a lot of hell in childbirth.

42
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,360
So uh.

43
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,360
Yeah.

44
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,160
Being born is hard work.

45
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,360
It's a lot of pushing.

46
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,840
Alright, uh, we're going to, uh, so we do have some guests here, because this all happened

47
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:33,080
this morning, we weren't really prepared to have another co-host come in.

48
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:36,680
We are going to have something a little more permanent, um, well, not, not permanent, because

49
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,880
obviously Loki's not being replaced.

50
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:41,600
God, no, he'll come back, uh, but you know, for about the next month or so, while Loki's

51
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:46,440
off being a daddy, uh, we'll have a more long-term co-host next week, uh, but for now, we have

52
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,440
some special guests.

53
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,440
I have a co-host, Rob.

54
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,440
What's that?

55
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,440
Where is it?

56
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,440
Ah, how your co-host fails.

57
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,440
Alright.

58
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,520
Next guest is turned for me.

59
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:00,320
Okay, the batteries are dying on the Dalek, that ought to tell you something.

60
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,320
No, it's not dying.

61
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,440
It needs to exterminate itself.

62
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,320
We do have some guests here in studio tonight.

63
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:09,360
Let's say hello first to, uh, and I, I've met both of these guests for the first and

64
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,360
second time tonight, so I apologize if I'm mispronouncing you, but you're Mila?

65
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,360
Myla.

66
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,360
Myla.

67
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,360
Myla Minoke.

68
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,360
How are you, Myla Minoke?

69
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:23,360
I am doing very well, my sir, and I'm glad to be your guest on the show.

70
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,800
We don't, wait, we're not hearing you at all, and I'm trying to figure out why.

71
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,800
Turn my mic.

72
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,360
See, Rob, you were afraid that my mic was going to be crappy.

73
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,360
What is going on?

74
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,400
Is this, is the switch on?

75
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,400
That's always a common mistake.

76
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,400
Yes.

77
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,400
Hello out there in Disneyland.

78
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,400
Much better.

79
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,400
Hello.

80
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,400
Yes.

81
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,400
First, first rule of radio, turn your mic on.

82
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,400
Yeah, turn my mic on.

83
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,400
So, yes.

84
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,400
Let's try this from the top.

85
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,400
Myla.

86
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,400
Hi there.

87
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,400
How are you?

88
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,400
I'm doing fantastic.

89
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,760
Um, I'm actually, I was actually turned onto the show by our wonderful, uh, intern, Dronami,

90
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:55,160
and I am, I guess I'm the sub-intern, I guess I count, as the sub-intern.

91
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,160
You're the intern's intern.

92
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,560
You're the, you're the intern's gopher.

93
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,560
Yeah, I'm the gopher.

94
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,560
You're the gopher.

95
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,560
Aw, dammit.

96
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,720
Now you, but you have a lot in common gaming-wise with intern Drew, right?

97
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,720
Yes.

98
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,360
What, you're, you, you described yourself to me as like a budget gamer.

99
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,720
That's the type of video games you're into?

100
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,720
Yes.

101
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,840
Um, if it costs less than ten bucks, I've usually either played it, played it or bought

102
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,840
it.

103
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,840
So.

104
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,840
Yeah.

105
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:17,840
I'm, I'm usually very much on the budget gaming.

106
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,880
So much so that my MMO of choice is RuneScape.

107
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,880
Why?

108
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,000
Cause it's free.

109
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,640
We have news about a free MMO tonight, a new one going free.

110
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,120
So we'll talk about that a little later.

111
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,120
Very much.

112
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,800
But also we had a very interesting, um, meeting you and I did.

113
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,800
Yeah.

114
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,000
Thanks to a particular somebody else in this room.

115
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,800
So let's get to him and then talk about the meeting.

116
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,800
Okay.

117
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,800
So let's introduce somebody else.

118
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,360
So we also have joining us tonight, Gary.

119
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,360
Yes.

120
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,360
Yep.

121
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,360
That's me.

122
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,360
How you doing, Gary?

123
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,360
Um, all right.

124
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,360
Glad to be here.

125
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,360
Yes.

126
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,360
He's a friend of Punk Night.

127
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,360
Yeah.

128
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,680
Everybody is so like, like randomly connected to OLR somehow.

129
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,680
I've got to forget this.

130
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,680
You might know me as Mindstorm or SMF 2045 online.

131
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,680
Okay.

132
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,680
Either one of those.

133
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,680
Right on.

134
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,680
Um.

135
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,680
That'd be smf.

136
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,680
Getting back.

137
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,680
Yeah.

138
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,680
Whatever.

139
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,680
It's an acronym.

140
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,680
I'll explain later.

141
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,680
I know.

142
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,000
But, um, trying to get back into console gaming after hiatus of several years, um, need to

143
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
get caught up.

144
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
He plays a lot of D&D.

145
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,520
I'm hoping we can talk about something you're into tonight.

146
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,480
Now, yeah, you, you confessed to me before the show that you're just, you're just kind

147
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:20,720
of here for the atmosphere tonight cause you don't really play a lot of console games or

148
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,720
PC games.

149
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,720
Right?

150
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,720
You play games.

151
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,720
Not entirely true.

152
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,720
Okay.

153
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,720
Okay.

154
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,680
I, well, I got the impression you're more of a games that involve more than six sides

155
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,680
on my dice.

156
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,680
Yes.

157
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,680
I'm a tabletop gamer.

158
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,680
Nothing wrong with that.

159
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,040
But thanks to Dark, Dark Sakura, I picked up SimCity 3 and when I get a, when I get a chance

160
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,040
to play it, I love it.

161
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,040
SimCity?

162
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,040
Sims 3.

163
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,040
Sims 3.

164
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,040
Sims 3.

165
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,040
Yes.

166
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,040
There was a SimCity 3.

167
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,040
I know.

168
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,040
But you mod them.

169
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,200
No, I left off SimCity a long time ago.

170
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,720
I just downloaded boob sliders.

171
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,040
Well, I do.

172
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,280
This isn't the first time I've met Gary.

173
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,920
The first time I met Gary was at Jamie's rock band party.

174
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,920
Oh yes.

175
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,920
Rock band.

176
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,920
The beer potluck.

177
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,920
Oh yes.

178
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,920
That was technically the beer potluck.

179
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,920
I don't remember the beer potluck.

180
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,920
When was that?

181
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,920
Your mic is dying.

182
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,920
I don't know.

183
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,920
Ouch.

184
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,920
My ears.

185
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,920
Jamie.

186
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,920
Okay.

187
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:15,280
So everyone was, I told everyone to bring beer so we could have a beer potluck and Gary

188
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,040
brought meat which was almost as good.

189
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,960
Yeah, because I don't drink.

190
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,960
No.

191
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:25,000
But, but, you know, we finally, I still have one Guinness left from that time, Rob.

192
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
One Guinness.

193
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,920
And I'm gonna drink the fuck out of that Guinness.

194
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:31,440
And you'll be able to skip a meal when you do because Guinness is liquid bread.

195
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,440
Oh, yummy.

196
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:36,840
But, but that's gonna be my celebration for being off Vicodin because my hand is fucked

197
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,840
up even more now.

198
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,840
Aw.

199
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,840
And by the way, thanks for the peach beer.

200
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,840
It was delicious.

201
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,840
Yes.

202
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,840
I couldn't.

203
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,840
You remember I couldn't drink the, the peach Lombek.

204
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,840
Oh yeah.

205
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,840
I gave it to her.

206
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,840
Nice.

207
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,840
It was wonderful.

208
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,840
I loved it.

209
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,840
Yeah.

210
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,840
So, um, so now for the story.

211
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,840
Yay.

212
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,840
Oh, story time?

213
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,840
Yes.

214
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,840
This is how we met.

215
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,840
Ashley.

216
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,840
Uh, Myla.

217
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,840
Yeah.

218
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,840
We, we skip names all the time.

219
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:04,880
So anyway, um, Gary tells me that on our way to Shule downtown that we're picking up somebody.

220
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:11,160
So I instantly am pounced, hugged by this person and I'm like, okay, hi, you're fun.

221
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,920
I instantly like you.

222
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:16,840
And then we, she's talking about playing DDR and I said, Oh yeah, I used to moderate on

223
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,840
DDR freak.

224
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,840
It was dark Sakura.

225
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:26,120
And she's like from orange lounge, you know, drew a funny small world in it.

226
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,000
So we both called him and left him.

227
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,720
Um, what the fuck voice messages?

228
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,720
Wait a minute.

229
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,720
Wait a minute.

230
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,840
Is tonight on OLR like Jew party?

231
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,360
Is that what this is tonight?

232
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,360
What's the matter?

233
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,360
I don't count.

234
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,360
Oh, okay.

235
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,360
Oh, I thought, Oh, I thought you.

236
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,360
Oh, okay.

237
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,840
Is it the people in this room are only half true.

238
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,720
There's only half Jewish.

239
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,720
Yeah.

240
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,720
I'm Jewish by proxy.

241
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,720
Okay.

242
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,720
All right.

243
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,160
So we have Jew, Jew by proxy, Jew in training and not Jew.

244
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,160
Okay.

245
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,160
And gay.

246
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,320
The short, the short word for not Jew is goi.

247
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,640
Well, welcome, welcome to the world.

248
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,640
Here's your Yiddish lesson.

249
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:03,800
I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, welcome to the world of oppressive of oppressed peoples.

250
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,800
Yes.

251
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,520
But, but I love, I love the Jewish people.

252
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:10,680
I would say I'm a, I'm a, like, I'm not a fag hag, but I'm a, I'm a Jew.

253
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,680
I'm a Jew hag.

254
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,680
I don't know.

255
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,680
What would you call it?

256
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,600
Like a, like somebody who likes to hang out.

257
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,600
You're a goi toy.

258
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,600
A goi toy.

259
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,600
There you go.

260
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,600
All right.

261
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,600
Don't mind us.

262
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,240
We're geeks, we're gamers and we're fun.

263
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,880
And, and very silly.

264
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:31,560
Honestly, guys, this is one of those weeks where I don't know why we're doing a show

265
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,560
tonight.

266
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,920
Like, why not?

267
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:38,400
I think it's because we need, we need this, Rob, for some reason, guys, like we decided

268
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:42,800
to do the, the trial Facebook ad campaign this week, which I'll talk about in a minute.

269
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,480
It's not, it's not a big deal, but you know, we're, we're trying to get word out there

270
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,860
more about the show.

271
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,080
And so we probably have some brand new people listening for the first time tonight.

272
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,080
We're sorry.

273
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:55,840
And I'm thinking to myself, apologies in advance, please go back in the archives and listen

274
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,560
like three 74 was a good show.

275
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:01,000
I'm glad that you have these numbers memorized because I sure as hell don't.

276
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,880
Hey, how do you know it's not going to be a good show tonight?

277
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,880
No, it'll be fine.

278
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:09,400
We're all like, and that being really fun, especially when we're completely just thrown

279
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,400
off our patterns.

280
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,400
Yeah.

281
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,400
Random is hilarious.

282
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,160
I think all of us tonight kind of collected, well, I can't speak for the guests, but I

283
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,240
know Jamie and I just kind of don't give a fuck tonight.

284
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,240
At least I don't.

285
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,760
I, you guys have me on the show, so I know you don't give a fuck.

286
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,760
You guys have me on the show, so it's proof you don't give a fuck.

287
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,760
I gave a fuck, but I don't remember who I gave it to.

288
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,760
Probably Dan.

289
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,760
That's dangerous.

290
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:34,280
But yeah, there was, um, we should probably get into the how was our weekend day and shit

291
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,280
because there was some stuff.

292
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,160
Well, technically it's how was your gaming week is how we start off.

293
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,800
But I know, I know you're dying to talk about why you're off.

294
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,280
I really don't have an excuse.

295
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,040
I'm just, I'm on the rag.

296
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,520
I'm on man rag tonight.

297
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,720
I don't know what you'd call that.

298
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,080
I have some Vagisil if you need it.

299
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,240
I don't need that.

300
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,240
That's for damn sure.

301
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,240
I just need some freshening, Rob.

302
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,240
Do you feel not so fresh?

303
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,240
We could get you a douche.

304
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,240
You know how, you're a douche.

305
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,240
Your face is a douche.

306
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,240
Ow.

307
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,240
You know how.

308
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,480
I'll friend your butt.

309
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,560
I know you, I know you know what I'm talking about.

310
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:10,560
You know how like, somebody will just tell you good morning and you'll want to be like,

311
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,760
why are you looking at me like that?

312
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,920
Although that makes it sound like it's about my relationship, but it's really, it's not

313
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,600
like my relationship is awesome.

314
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:23,160
I think Alan is the best thing ever, but I think everything else, everything else.

315
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,960
I want him to be my gay boyfriend.

316
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:28,080
But you're already, you can't have him, he's mine.

317
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,080
All right.

318
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,080
All right.

319
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:35,280
Well, anyhow, so, so I'm just, I don't know, I'm just being a bitch tonight.

320
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,840
What's, what's your excuse, DarkSaga?

321
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:42,120
Well, um, and I'm, I'm going to go into details, kind of details about this, just because it's

322
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:47,920
something that people, especially gamers with, who are stereotypically lazy gamers who eat

323
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,400
Cheetos and all kinds of crap, need to be freaking aware.

324
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:55,640
We don't know any of those, as I need chips during the show.

325
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,640
S-T-F-U.

326
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,480
Rob, you're eating something kind of healthy.

327
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,480
Kind of.

328
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,120
I had a banana for breakfast anyway.

329
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:10,720
My husband, Dan, age 34, went into the hospital Tuesday morning at a quarter after three for

330
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,720
congestive heart failure.

331
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,800
My husband is 34 years old.

332
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:20,920
This is something that you could die from or suffer massive damage to your other organs.

333
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:25,400
Eventually he was coughing up blood and feeling really short of breath.

334
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:29,840
He didn't have any of the pain or numbness, so thankfully his heart was in good shape.

335
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:34,800
Um, but he's, he went in early Tuesday morning and got to leave Friday afternoon or actually

336
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:39,160
more like Friday evening and, um, his blood pressure was super high.

337
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:45,320
Thankfully after numerous ultrasounds and x-rays and what give you rays and tests and

338
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:51,040
things and prodding, lots of prodding, um, he, um, they determined that all the rest

339
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:56,480
of him worked just fine and he didn't damage his organs and he could come home, but he's

340
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:02,200
on blood pressure medication now, quite a bit of it and, um, low sodium diet.

341
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,680
And this is just a word of warning, you know, Dan said that, you know, I'd been harping

342
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:10,040
on him, you've heard me harp on him, you know, people have been telling him and he just was

343
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:13,320
not ready to believe it until it finally happened to him.

344
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:17,800
And I warn everybody out there, and we've got someone in the room who's been through

345
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,800
the same, similar.

346
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:24,520
Yeah, mine wasn't quite as serious, but President's Day weekend this year actually, um, I was

347
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:30,480
at a game convention and I felt really sick, uh, to the point where I got stuck in the

348
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:35,880
lobby of the convention, uh, and paramedics came because I felt faint, didn't feel like

349
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:40,960
I could get up, um, missed a day at the convention because I was convalescing, managed to drive

350
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:45,640
back to Sacramento, but then that week, um, when I was going to bed one night, I started

351
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:50,000
feeling dizzy, my heart was racing and I thought I was going to black out, so I called 911.

352
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,440
They took me to the hospital and they told me that I had, I forget the exact medical

353
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,280
name, but it was basically a viral infection of the lining of my heart, but it gave me

354
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:04,300
very, very, very similar symptoms to congestive heart failure to the point where they gave

355
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:08,260
me a pamphlet on congestive heart failure, what to eat, what not to eat, how to take

356
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,260
care of yourself.

357
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:14,400
So I can relate to Dan's situation and I definitely feel for you, this is scary and thank God

358
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,400
you're getting through it.

359
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,400
Let this be a warning to everybody.

360
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,400
Mike.

361
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,400
I am talking on my mic.

362
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,400
It's, it's...

363
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,400
LA!

364
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,400
Your connection at the base is...

365
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,400
Okay, I'm holding it in.

366
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,400
I'm holding it in.

367
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,400
Yeah, I can hear you.

368
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,400
Okay.

369
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,400
Well, of course you can hear me.

370
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,400
Well, I mean through your mic.

371
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,400
Okay.

372
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:34,000
Anyway, um, let this be a warning to everybody that, you know, don't think this can't happen

373
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
to me.

374
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,920
I really, and, and I know, and again, it's like with Dan's situation, he wasn't ready

375
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,320
to change until he got slapped in the face with it.

376
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,320
Yeah.

377
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,120
I, I really warn everybody not to get to that point.

378
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,480
So, and you know, in my show Solidarity for Dance, since he's got to be restrictive, I'm

379
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:55,480
going back fully into my 70 to 80% raw food.

380
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,920
Um, I am going to stick with it.

381
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,320
I've bought dance pads so we can play DDR at home.

382
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,320
Nice.

383
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,320
Yeah, this, let this be a lesson.

384
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,320
Get this, get this.

385
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,240
I mean, you know, we used to, we've got tons of dance pads, but I found, um, uh, not Cobalt

386
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,240
Flux.

387
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,240
What are the other ones called?

388
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,240
Ignitions.

389
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,240
Ignition pads.

390
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,760
Three of them for, um, for $6 at the thrift store.

391
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,520
I don't know if they work, but they were in good shape.

392
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:22,120
I'm going to clean the crap out of them and I'm gonna make Dan play some Boom Boom Dollar

393
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,120
with me.

394
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,120
Yay.

395
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,120
Shoot.

396
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,120
But, um, that sounds awesome.

397
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,120
But that's what my week's been.

398
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:33,200
So really, um, as far as going into gaming, I ain't played shit except for Ragnarok Online,

399
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,560
which I'm playing again.

400
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:39,600
And really I played that because it's so freaking, it was so mindless that I could just play

401
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,400
in and not have to think because I wasn't able to sleep.

402
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:48,080
I went that first day on an hour and a half of sleep and did not go to bed until something

403
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:52,000
like I took, yeah, a little nap, which is my hour and a half of sleep.

404
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,920
And then I was up until like three in the morning and I was up again at nine the next

405
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,920
day.

406
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:02,680
And I just, it's been, I slept really funny.

407
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:06,400
And I've spent, I've never been so freaked out in my life, even though I knew he was

408
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:11,400
in good hands, you know, and this is the other thing too.

409
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:15,200
And you know, I know I'm probably going into a bit of personal detail, but I don't care.

410
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,240
I have a microphone and I'm going to use it.

411
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,880
Tonight's the feel good episode of OLR everybody.

412
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:26,720
Don't make me bust out the booze, Hila.

413
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:33,600
At any rate, um, the, uh, the way things were going, you know, Dan and I were talking about,

414
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,040
you know, we've been talking about having a kid, me and Dan, I know I've been forthcoming

415
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,040
on this, on the show.

416
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,800
Cause I'm going to totally get Matt to do a nursery.

417
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,200
Oh, mini Sakura.

418
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,200
Yay.

419
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:46,920
Is this a tangent where I can mention that Matt's nursery was actually on Game Informer,

420
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:50,440
which I guess is that a big blog or magazine?

421
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,440
I'm going to be honest.

422
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,320
Game Informer is the one that's the GameStop one.

423
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,320
Yes.

424
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,320
Okay.

425
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,400
So he was on that, but it had nothing to do with OLR.

426
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:02,520
They found his pictures on Flickr.

427
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:07,400
So just a heads up to everybody and not to get too tangenty from Dark Sakura's important

428
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,200
story, but, um, be careful what you put up on the internet.

429
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,520
I mean, obviously who cares about this?

430
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:15,720
This is a good thing for Matt cause it's kind of cute that people care, but be careful.

431
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,360
I will shove that iPhone sideways.

432
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,360
Yeah.

433
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,680
Sounds good to me.

434
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,080
Here's the thing, but whatever you put on like Flickr, public Facebook, public Twitter

435
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,880
can be picked up by like anybody.

436
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:33,640
However, you can, um, you can copyright the photos and then they have to pay you.

437
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:37,720
But in this case it's good news, but you just, you just gotta be careful what you put up

438
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,720
on the internet.

439
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,960
Just if it hadn't been good news, you know, you want to be, you want to be careful.

440
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,960
Yeah.

441
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,120
Just be careful what you say on your Facebook accounts.

442
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,680
People have gotten fired from jobs because they said something their bosses didn't like.

443
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,480
That's why mine is fully blocked and I don't allow, I really don't allow photo tagging.

444
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,440
You know, if someone's tagged my stuff, I go look it up and I'll look at the stuff I

445
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,440
tagged myself.

446
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,760
Hate that Facebook does not let you approve what you get tagged in.

447
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:03,600
But nobody can see, nobody can see my stuff.

448
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,600
Okay.

449
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,600
Nobody who's not a friend of yours.

450
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,600
Yeah, exactly.

451
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,600
All right.

452
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,600
And I don't allow friend to friend viewing.

453
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,600
Mm hmm.

454
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,600
Understood.

455
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,600
Yeah.

456
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,600
Sorry.

457
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,600
Sorry Jamie.

458
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,600
Back to your traumatic week.

459
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,600
Yes.

460
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,600
So please share with us.

461
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,600
Anyway.

462
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,680
Well, you know, Dan and I were talking about having a kid and now I totally don't want

463
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:24,680
to really do it until I'm sure he's going to stick with, with this as much as I would

464
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:30,160
like when I want to make sure that, you know, and, and we were actually, the ironic thing

465
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:34,960
is that we were talking about that Tuesday, um, Monday during the day is, you know, how,

466
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,740
and I wasn't so much worried about him dying.

467
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:39,760
I was worried about him not being able to keep up with a kid, you know, cause Dan's

468
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:45,760
a big guy and now I'm actually worried about maybe, you know, him dying and I'm, you know,

469
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:50,060
I'm 30, I'm, I'll say right now, I'm 34 years old, you know, Dan and I are coming up on

470
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:52,440
our fifth anniversary on September 1st.

471
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:58,660
We've been together for almost 14 years as of January and you know, I've never thought

472
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:01,400
for an instant I was ever going to have to be without him.

473
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:05,560
So it was, you know, and not that I'm saying that I'm one of those, oh, I'll die if you

474
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:10,040
die, you know, or I can't go without you, I can't do anything by myself.

475
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,840
You know, I'm not that one of those type of, of people.

476
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,560
I would be okay.

477
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:19,480
I would be incredibly depressed, but I would be okay.

478
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:22,640
It's just that it's something that no one ever thinks about.

479
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:28,200
So I also say, you know, uh, people out there, if you have a significant other or someone

480
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:34,680
in your family that is at risk, you need to sit down and have the talk with them because

481
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:38,120
when they think it can't happen, it does.

482
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:41,760
And so, you know, even though we're being one of those game podcasts, yet another one

483
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:46,160
that doesn't actually seem to talk about games for 30 minutes, this is important because,

484
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,720
you know, if you are, you know, sitting there and you're, you're down in Doritos and maybe

485
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:55,320
you're a little bit fluffy, you know, chances are me too.

486
00:18:55,320 --> 00:19:00,180
I think it's, you know, when it happens to all of us, I'm, I'm feeling a little fluffy

487
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,180
right now.

488
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:05,880
In fact, my grandpa, my grandma's got a refrigerator magnet says, I'm not fat, I'm fluffy, fluffy.

489
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,520
It's something that it's something to watch out for.

490
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,320
If you spend lots of time sitting, you know, I used to work in an office and, you know,

491
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,800
play games, didn't get much exercise.

492
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:16,280
It was a wake up call early this year.

493
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,520
Even if you're not, well, I don't know about that.

494
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:22,400
I don't know if I go that far, but I still want to borrow your Wii Fit.

495
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:27,760
Even if you're not fluffy, it just, you know, take time to just kind of evaluate, you know,

496
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:37,640
am I going outside enough, am I walking, am I maybe eating not so good as I could be?

497
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,420
The straight Cheetos diet is not necessarily good for him.

498
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:46,520
And this is, this is going to be our big thing is watch the refined carbohydrates, you know,

499
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,520
watch the processed foods.

500
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:52,400
Seriously, what, even if it says low sodium on the can, no, no, no, no, no, no.

501
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,160
If it's canned, it's got sodium in it.

502
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,160
It's not, yeah.

503
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:58,160
Almost all the processed soups have tons of sodium on them.

504
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,840
Like Dan's limited to 2000 calories, not calories, 2000 milligrams a day of sodium.

505
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:05,120
They put me on a low sodium diet too.

506
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,880
I can't eat anything in the canned soup aisle anymore.

507
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:08,880
It's way too salty.

508
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,320
I'm going to, even though dark soccer is giving you great advice and these are all important

509
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:18,160
things that you should consider, like I'm going to give you like a diet so easy anybody

510
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,160
can do it.

511
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:22,060
Like seriously, you don't have to, you don't even have to look at the back of a package.

512
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,060
This is it.

513
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,060
This is the diet.

514
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,060
This is the diet.

515
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:26,060
This is how it works.

516
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:27,060
It's called don't eat shit.

517
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:31,360
Well, yeah, that's a given, but you'd be surprised how hard that is sometimes.

518
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:37,680
You'd be surprised how much shit you're eating and I'm honest, I eat a lot of shit and I

519
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,200
really need to cut back on that.

520
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,720
I'm not, I don't, that was just mean.

521
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,800
I don't mean actual poop shit.

522
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:49,280
I mean crappy food, like McDonald's, Burger King, all that fast food crap.

523
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:54,080
You know, everybody knows you're not stupid people.

524
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,440
You know how to download a podcast on the internet.

525
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,840
You're not dumb.

526
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:02,240
You know what's good for you and what's not good for you and it's okay to indulge once

527
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,240
in a while.

528
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:08,240
God, I don't know where I would be in this world without chicken McNuggets, but you don't

529
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:13,200
order the 20 pack of chicken McNuggets and you don't do it every day for one person.

530
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,200
Get a happy meal.

531
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,200
Yeah.

532
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,200
You know, that's this.

533
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,020
You know, the other bit of advice I have with this, and Dan is thankfully learning this

534
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:24,840
now is just the eat when you're hungry, stop when you're not, not when you're full, when

535
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:25,840
you're not hungry.

536
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:30,440
And you also need to make sure you eat at regular intervals, breakfast, lunch, dinner,

537
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:33,400
and maybe a small snack in between, but don't eat super late and stuff like that.

538
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,400
I eat it eight times a day.

539
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,560
Yes, that's good if you eat small meals a day.

540
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:40,200
But I eat about 100 to 200 calories a pop.

541
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,200
There you go.

542
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,200
That's a small meal.

543
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,480
But as long as I stick with my mostly raw food, I don't have to track what I eat.

544
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,360
The one problem is that I don't get enough sodium.

545
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,360
Irony.

546
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,040
You have the opposite problem.

547
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,720
I have the opposite problem, yep.

548
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,720
Interesting.

549
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,480
Because I eat mostly fruits and vegetables and they're raw and processed.

550
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,840
If they're processed, it's because I threw them in my blender.

551
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,400
But I know you eat beef occasionally.

552
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,400
Sometimes.

553
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,400
Occasionally.

554
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,400
Sometimes.

555
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:10,880
So anyway, um, we're going to get back in the games here, but, um, just, uh, you know,

556
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,960
also I, this is important to say, there's nothing wrong if you are a little fluffy.

557
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:15,960
Everybody's a little fluffy.

558
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,200
It's in, it's fine.

559
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,200
It's American.

560
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,200
Somebody just...

561
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,120
Love yourself the way you are, but make sure that you pay attention to your health.

562
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,480
Just be fluffy and healthy.

563
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,480
Yeah.

564
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:29,160
You know, as one last little tangent, I was reading an article, something about, um, six

565
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:36,420
months ago, I think, that was about, um, comparing skinny people to technically overweight people

566
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:42,400
and how, um, a good number of people are, that are overweight are technically, um, in

567
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,760
better shape than the skinny people that was talking about actually, um, what they were

568
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:53,480
calling, um, low weight obesity, meaning that they had a higher range of, uh, fat to muscle

569
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,020
ratio than these other people did.

570
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,020
Never heard of that.

571
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,020
Low weight obesity.

572
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:58,020
Low weight obesity.

573
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,080
Let's go to our chat room.

574
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:05,000
You guys chat.orangelaungeradio.com where we like to leave, uh, leave, read comments.

575
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
See, I told you I'm out of it tonight.

576
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,320
As we do tape live on Sunday nights at all games radio, uh, Burr first comment tonight

577
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:15,240
in our chat room at chat.orangelaungeradio.com says, his diet plan is to play so much.

578
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,240
Wow.

579
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,720
You don't have time to eat shit.

580
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:23,000
Um, that's half true, but you'd be surprised how much shit you eat while you're sitting

581
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,400
there in front of a computer playing games, usually because it's convenient and convenient

582
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,640
food, convenient food is usually shitty food.

583
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,640
Anyway, I'm sorry.

584
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,320
I didn't mean to get on the health kick, but it is important.

585
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,320
Obviously bring it up once in a while.

586
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:38,440
And that when it hits you in the face like that is sort of like the best thing you can

587
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:41,520
do is share it with other people so that they learn from your issues.

588
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,520
True.

589
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,520
True.

590
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,520
No.

591
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,520
And we do reach a wide audience on this show.

592
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:51,080
So if we can save one other person from having to go to the hospital, then I was 20.

593
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,080
Your mic again.

594
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,080
Your mic's mad at you.

595
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,080
Okay.

596
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,080
Clearly.

597
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,080
I was, I was mad.

598
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,080
I got over being worried.

599
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:03,760
I was mad because honestly, who does he have to blame for, for what happened to him, himself?

600
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,680
When my genes get snug, who do I have to blame for that?

601
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,680
Well, it's okay.

602
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:13,320
Sometimes I have, you know, PMS to blame for that, but usually it's, it's me.

603
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,720
You know, we have to be responsible for ourselves.

604
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,720
Nothing.

605
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:21,560
Like all those morons out there who are out there suing McDonald's and shit because, oh

606
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:24,680
I ate your hamburgers and I got overweight, man.

607
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:28,360
Well, don't eat the damn food, stupid.

608
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,400
End of story.

609
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,400
You know?

610
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,400
So anyway, I'm sorry for going off that.

611
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,780
So how about my games, Rob?

612
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:34,780
How about your games?

613
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:35,780
You already mentioned games.

614
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:36,780
You didn't play a lot.

615
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:41,480
But Star Trek Online episode two came out, which I got, I, you know, my hand has been

616
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:45,920
killing me because, oh, on top of all this crap with Dan, my hand's infected.

617
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,920
When I move my finger, it squishes.

618
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,920
Ew.

619
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,920
That's not good.

620
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,920
That's really gross.

621
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,920
I'm going to the doctor tomorrow.

622
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:55,920
Anyway, so I couldn't really do much, but I did get to explore my ship.

623
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,560
They've expanded the ships.

624
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,440
I have an engineering deck.

625
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,600
I have captain's quarters.

626
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,520
I have a sick bay and a lounge and a ready room on my bridge.

627
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,180
See, I got to get into this online Star Trek.

628
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:09,180
This just sounds awesome.

629
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,180
It's beautiful.

630
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:15,120
But, so I didn't really get to do much except talk to my fleet mates and run around my ship

631
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,120
like a crazy person.

632
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,560
But it was really cool.

633
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:22,000
In Star Trek Online, do you ever get to eject the warp core breach or the warp core because

634
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
of a breach or whatever?

635
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
No.

636
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Really?

637
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,800
But my friend told me today that they're going to be doing on-ship missions.

638
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,800
Yay.

639
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,920
So maybe you do have a warp core breach.

640
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,360
I meant eject the warp core.

641
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,840
Of course my mind goes to the drink automatically, but yeah, eject the warp core because of a

642
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:37,840
breach.

643
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,840
Because that was like every episode of Star Trek.

644
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:39,840
They had to eject the warp core.

645
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:44,960
You know, I did find that the warp core breach was a legitimate drink from the show and he

646
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,560
pulled it out in the same bowl and everything.

647
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,560
Cork did.

648
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,560
Good times.

649
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,560
Anyway.

650
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,560
All right.

651
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,560
Is that it for your gaming week?

652
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:58,560
Oh yeah, Dan's buddy Will started Crackdown 2, so we just kept making fun of the boss.

653
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,600
Going, shut up, dude.

654
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,400
We know.

655
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,720
So anyway.

656
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:10,340
My gaming week, you know, obviously I play a lot of Warcraft, as a chatter earlier said,

657
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:13,960
but yourself.

658
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:17,960
Our little raid group finally cleared the Trial of the Champion on 10man, which yes

659
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:21,160
I know is like behind where most guilds are at right now, but we just started raiding

660
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,480
like last month.

661
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,480
So shut up.

662
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,480
We're awesome.

663
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,960
So that was fun.

664
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:30,320
And other than that though, I've been trying to play games other than WoW, but I didn't

665
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,720
have a lot of success this week.

666
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,880
I did play some Game Room.

667
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,480
I played Frostbite on Game Room, which just came out.

668
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,040
That's an old, old, old school Atari 2600 game that I remember from when I was a kid.

669
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,240
We used to stay up and play that for hours.

670
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,320
And it's still kind of cool.

671
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:47,680
Although I think a lot of you that don't get the classic gaming thing will not get this

672
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:50,680
either, so I don't expect everybody to run out and download it.

673
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:53,840
But the cool thing about Game Room, again, you can demo everything for 10 minutes, which

674
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:59,240
is more than enough time to figure out if you like an old school arcade game or not.

675
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,840
I've also been playing more Puzzle Quest II.

676
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:04,760
I started the whole dang game over just so I could play as an assassin, because it seems

677
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:08,440
like it's so much easier to just cut through things left and right, or I should say poison

678
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:13,280
them to death, overload them with poison, as an assassin.

679
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:16,760
Before I was playing the paladin-y type of class, it was more of a defender, and it's

680
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,480
just like the matches went on forever.

681
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,120
But as an assassin, I'm just like cutting people left and right.

682
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,240
It's awesome.

683
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,960
And this time, I hope to not miss any side quests like I did the first time.

684
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,920
You know, that reminds me of when you were going around saying, bitch, I cut you.

685
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:32,280
Yeah, it's kind of like that, but now I'm Puzzle Quest.

686
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,280
New games this week.

687
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:38,720
I did check out just the demo for Hydro Thunder Hurricane, because I wanted to see, and Jamie's

688
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,440
yelling, it's awesome.

689
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,560
I actually didn't really agree with her.

690
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:47,000
I was just kind of like, eh, it's okay.

691
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,140
There's something about playing that game in a big old cabinet at the arcade with other

692
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:56,760
people that was much more fun to me than sitting at home in my chair playing it on my Xbox

693
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,760
controller.

694
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,760
I don't know.

695
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,760
I just wasn't feeling it.

696
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,400
The graphics didn't do it for me either.

697
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,560
It's just something about it.

698
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:05,840
Like I feel like it wasn't awesome.

699
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,560
But you know, again, I'm only playing a demo.

700
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,360
I'm not trying to review the whole game.

701
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:13,920
I'm just saying, was I sold on the game based on what I played?

702
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,920
Nah.

703
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:17,000
So I ended up passing on the full version.

704
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
You guys, Jamie's yelling.

705
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,480
She bought the full version, but she is not in a mic right now, so we can't hear her.

706
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,520
We can't hear you.

707
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,080
Let's see.

708
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,600
So what else did I play this week?

709
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:32,160
Sadly, I didn't play Starcraft 2, although it seems like everybody's been playing that

710
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:35,560
because I haven't picked it up yet.

711
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,520
It's too much money right now.

712
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:42,960
It seems to be all of it, most of you guys are talking about Starcraft 2, DC Universe.

713
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,880
DC Universe I'm excited about.

714
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,440
There's that new trailer out for DC Universe that looked pretty hot.

715
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,880
Do I have to interrupt?

716
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,880
What?

717
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,640
Dan got Starcraft 2 and it's gorgeous and the collection edition comes with all the

718
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,920
old versions.

719
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:59,580
And we did get Hydra Thunder Hurricane, except I can't play it right now.

720
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:00,580
And he loves it.

721
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:01,580
But he loved the old one too.

722
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:02,580
Really?

723
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:03,580
I don't know.

724
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:04,580
Maybe I was just in a bad mood.

725
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:05,580
You'll have to see the new levels.

726
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:08,560
The level in, I think it's in Turkey.

727
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:11,440
That's gorgeous.

728
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,960
There was some interesting mechanics with it.

729
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,400
Like I didn't like hate it, but I just was, you know, there's so much other games to play

730
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:19,920
right now that I wasn't like, ah, I want to drop 15 bucks on this, especially knowing

731
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,500
that the Castlevania game's out next week.

732
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:25,120
And I know I'm going to want that just based on what games I've liked historically.

733
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:29,040
The problem I think with the game so far is the way you unlock, is the way that you unlock

734
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:32,880
the levels because you have to keep playing and keep playing and earn credits and then

735
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,520
you unlock the levels and it's not as cool.

736
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:41,160
Um, other games I've been playing this week, uh, on the PC, I actually bought a game on

737
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,120
Steam called Rhythm Zone.

738
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:50,040
Uh, it was a $9 game that is basically Guitar Hero for your computer, but you use the keys

739
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,040
to play.

740
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:55,640
I believe you can plug in USB devices, but going to be honest, didn't really look into

741
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,640
that.

742
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,080
Uh, I just played it with a keyboard.

743
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,480
The thing about the game is that yes, it has a library of songs that it comes with, but

744
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:07,720
it also will make a note chart to any MP3 on your drive.

745
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:12,080
As you can possibly imagine, if you've ever played one of those DDR games that makes up

746
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:16,960
the steps to the music as it goes along, uh, usually the note patterns that show up kind

747
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:22,120
of blow and it's just like, let's bang on random keys to my MP3 collection.

748
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,360
That's really a more appropriate title for the game.

749
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:29,280
Um, the game is just a straight up jack of Guitar Hero, really doesn't add anything new

750
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:34,200
to the mix except for, ooh, I can bang random keys to my MP3s.

751
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:40,480
Um, also for some inexplicable reason, the screen likes to slowly rotate to the left

752
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,720
and to the right.

753
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:45,280
I don't know why, but suddenly like, you know, you're doing, like imagine if you were playing

754
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:49,000
Guitar Hero and then just suddenly the whole screen started to rotate to the left like

755
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,520
45 degrees.

756
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:55,280
You'd be like, what in the fuck, what kind of fuckery is this going on right now?

757
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,960
And that's kind of exactly what was going on in Rhythm Zone.

758
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:02,560
So um, I really didn't like it, I'm sorry to say.

759
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:07,080
So I would say keep your $9 and just play more Alien Swarm, honestly.

760
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:13,880
Um, as much as I love Misa music games, and I guess the one nice thing I could say about

761
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:20,960
it is that it does seem like they have saved room to expand the game later on, so as long

762
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:25,400
as they don't make me pay for any of those expansions, because $9 is already too much

763
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:32,120
for what I got, that might be redeeming, but I'm not going to hold my breath.

764
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,760
Yes, that's Rhythm Zone on Steam.

765
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:35,760
Not a fan.

766
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,760
Okay.

767
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:42,880
Uh, let's see, that otherwise is pretty much it, especially as far as new stuff goes, didn't

768
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,520
really play a whole lot of other new stuff.

769
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:49,040
So I'm going to turn it over to Myla, have you been playing anything this week, New World?

770
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:53,600
Not only am I playing, have I been playing something, but I am playing something currently,

771
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:59,520
RuneScape, it's my new crack, well it's my old crack, I've been a member of this wonderful

772
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:04,240
game for, wow, since 1998.

773
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,840
We're not hearing you very well, make sure that mic's good, there you go.

774
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:07,840
Is it up?

775
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:08,840
Yay, yay, it's up.

776
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:14,400
Um, I've been playing RuneScape since 1998, I was a member, er, not a member, but a free

777
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:21,280
player back when the wilderness was PvP, what a concept, um, and then they switched it over

778
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:26,160
to PvP servers, which just made a lot of us just very unhappy.

779
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:31,120
Um, but then they released, about a year ago, they released the engineering skill, which

780
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:36,720
is what I'm working on right now, and it just, it brings a whole new level to the game.

781
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,480
It's, you know, originally RuneScape was, you know, something you played on the weekends

782
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:44,480
when you're bored and didn't have really anything to do, and, you know, you do one skill and

783
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:49,520
then you do another skill, and it's just kinda, you know, kinda monotonous kind of stuff and

784
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:54,000
it's really fun and, but now that the engineering skill's out, it's amazing because you can

785
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:00,040
use your regular skills that you get naturally through the game as a window into the new

786
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:05,880
skill, which is great, because, um, you use your magic skill for your magic-based attacks

787
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:09,240
just like you would in a regular game, but you also use your crafting skill to make new

788
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:15,240
armor, and you jump into the dungeoneering levels with no equipment.

789
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:21,080
You build your own equipment, you build your own things, everything that you do in the

790
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:24,880
dungeoneering is based off your regular stats.

791
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:30,200
And it's amazing because it really, you know, for those people like me who spent the, you

792
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:37,040
know, umpteenth million plus hours of, uh, of, you know, doing the skills, it actually

793
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:41,080
is a benefit because now I can, you know, waltz into a dungeon, beat a whole bunch of

794
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:46,040
bad guys, level up my armor, and keep going.

795
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:52,800
The only bad part I find with the skill is that when you, because it's one to four players,

796
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:57,640
it's one to four player group teams, you know, like a raiding party.

797
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:02,680
When you're soloing, it's a little more difficult, but you get more of the feel of the skill.

798
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:07,480
When you're doing the four member parties, especially in the earlier levels, it really

799
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:11,560
feels like you're just running in a dungeon, wasting everything, and keep going.

800
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:16,360
You know, you're maybe at the boss for like maybe, you know, fifteen seconds.

801
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:20,640
That sounds like playing a PSO back in the day.

802
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:25,520
But you know, as you go down into the levels, you know, the skill increases.

803
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,360
But therein lies the problem.

804
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:34,200
Whenever you start a dungeoneering level, it takes how many people are going in, and

805
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:38,280
then from there, it determines which level you start in.

806
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:45,040
So if you've been soloing for a long time, you'll be at like level fourteen, and you

807
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,960
know, the dungeons will be really harder, but if you don't do a lot of the four mans

808
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:51,800
or three mans, you'll be stuck at like the first couple of levels, and you'll be going,

809
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,000
where's the challenge?

810
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
What's going on?

811
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Everything's easy!

812
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,200
What the hell?

813
00:34:56,200 --> 00:35:00,080
So it's a little different, but it's really fun.

814
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,080
It's really, really fun.

815
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,800
Now RuneScape's been around since ninety-eight?

816
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,800
Yes.

817
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,800
Oh my gosh.

818
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,800
It's been around forever.

819
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:10,360
Have they done like major makeovers to it since then?

820
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:16,040
It's one of those things, RuneScape, it's been slowly evolving over the years, you know.

821
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:19,720
They'll release a patch here, a patch there.

822
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:27,680
Dungeoneering's really the first full world patch and update that they've done in literally

823
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,680
years.

824
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:34,440
You know what's funny is that a lot of people are talking Starcraft 2 this week, and what's

825
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:39,780
funny about Starcraft 2 is that it's an upgrade to a game that is about ten years old, what

826
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:41,880
Starcraft 1 came out what, ninety-nine?

827
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,880
Yeah.

828
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:46,680
And there were still people playing that, well there were people still playing it today

829
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:47,680
probably that haven't got the new one.

830
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,680
But people are still playing Diablo.

831
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:55,360
Oh yeah, I mean that's just as old too, so I mean, it's kind of funny to think, are you

832
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,360
playing RuneScape right now?

833
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,840
Yeah, I'm playing RuneScape right now and I'm just about to die.

834
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:03,200
But the good news is if you die in the Dungeoneering skill, they just pop you back to the homeworld.

835
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:08,680
You know, the only thing that death in Dungeoneering really accomplishes is, yes, you get a sucky

836
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:09,680
score at the end.

837
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,680
That's about all it does.

838
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:16,560
Now there's some folks in chat, I see DrewNami's in chat and he's saying RuneScape with kind

839
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:20,720
of one of those like, you know, whatever faces.

840
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:24,420
I don't think he's a fan of RuneScape, but it's free, right?

841
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:25,420
It's free.

842
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:27,180
That's one of the big puzzles.

843
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:28,340
Is it better than Yaris?

844
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:30,000
It's got to be better than Yaris.

845
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Alright.

846
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:37,320
Rob, my cat's stinky butt is better than Yaris.

847
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,380
Tigerclaw in our chatroom says, Starcraft 2 is a huge graphical upgrade.

848
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:42,160
It's no longer the pixelated graphics.

849
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,160
Everything is all 3D graphics.

850
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,160
Oh yeah, yeah.

851
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:48,120
Oh no, all the cinematic areas are in game, are real time.

852
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:52,520
No, no, and I understand that, but my point was is that, you know, RuneScape, yeah, it's

853
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:55,920
from 98 and people are still playing it today, which might seem weird, but I was just saying

854
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:00,560
like, Starcraft was out only one year later than that and hell, people are still playing

855
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,560
that.

856
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,520
I've been playing Ragnarok online since 97.

857
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,820
Oh my, is that game really that old?

858
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:07,820
Pretty old.

859
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:08,820
I can double check.

860
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:11,520
Because I knew it was out in Korea before that and I was playing on the Japanese servers

861
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,520
for a little while.

862
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,520
Interesting.

863
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:18,400
And then I was playing on the open beta for IRO.

864
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,400
Old games.

865
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,400
Alright, Mila.

866
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,400
Still playing it too.

867
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,240
Anything else you want to give a shout out to in a game you released here?

868
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:29,200
Well, hey Drew, other than that, nah, not really.

869
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:33,080
I'm literally in the middle of a dungeon right now and I'm kind of milling through it, so.

870
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,840
Alright, we'll try not to suck up all our bandwidth.

871
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:35,840
Alright.

872
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,840
I won't.

873
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,840
I know.

874
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,840
I won't.

875
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:41,520
Gary, now I know you said beforehand you weren't too much of a console or, well no, now you

876
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,920
might be a PC gamer, I'm here.

877
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:48,600
Well, I used to be console, I grew up with an 8 and 16 bit Nintendo, Final Fantasy, original

878
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,120
Final Fantasy, awesome.

879
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:58,360
I have a Playstation 2 that hasn't seen much use lately, more as a DVD player than a game

880
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,360
console.

881
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:06,840
But I get back into it and I picked up a couple of computer games and I always actively look

882
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:10,040
for interesting looking computer games.

883
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:13,360
I'm seriously looking at Batman Arkham Asylum.

884
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,520
That game is great.

885
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,280
Okay, another recommendation.

886
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:21,200
The reviews seem to be glowing all around, so it's probably something I'm going to have

887
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,200
to pick up.

888
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,600
If you like the Batman universe, it's, you know, they've got a lot of the voice actors

889
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:28,520
from the animated series and, you know, it's good.

890
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:35,080
Well, I'm watching the DC Universe Online trailer and it looks pretty awesome, at least

891
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,840
what they put together here.

892
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:37,880
It was very epic.

893
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,360
I did watch that earlier this week.

894
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:43,040
I'm really jazzed about DC Universe Online, I think it's going to be great.

895
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,320
The graphics look pretty crazy and awesome.

896
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:50,080
Yeah, I think my favorite part of that whole trailer was the part where Joker's about to

897
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:53,160
shoot the bazooka and Harley's literally holding him on the side of the building.

898
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,160
Yeah, I saw that.

899
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,160
Probably trying to drag him back.

900
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,160
Good times.

901
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:02,600
If you want to comment on anything we're talking about tonight, chat.orangeloungeradio.com is

902
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:07,240
the place to be or on the Game Surge Network, we are in channel Orange Lounge.

903
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,840
We don't use the regular all games chat room.

904
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:09,840
I don't know why.

905
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:13,600
It's just we always had a separate room and that way when we have a separate room, we're

906
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,680
in control and have ops and all that stuff.

907
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,680
We're just control freaks.

908
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:22,560
Alright, um, let's see, so, um, I was going to ask you about tabletop games.

909
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:26,160
I know we don't talk a lot about tabletop games, but briefly, what types of tabletop

910
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,160
games do you play?

911
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:33,200
Um, Dungeons and Dragons, 4th edition, okay, okay, stop with the booze, stop with the booze.

912
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,200
It's not bad.

913
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:38,320
You can do anything, just about anything in 4th edition you can do into previous ones.

914
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:41,840
I'm clueless when it comes to this stuff because I haven't played D&D in a while.

915
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:46,320
Why, I played a little bit like two years ago, but that maybe lasted a month.

916
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,920
Why are people so mad about 4th edition?

917
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:51,520
Because it's a genre shift.

918
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:56,720
Previous editions of D&D were high fantasy, lots of powerful spells.

919
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:00,520
You got them fairly early on in your character's career.

920
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:06,320
4th edition, you aren't flying until you're in the teen levels.

921
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:11,880
The teleportation is line of sight, very short distances, um, but you know, that's, it's

922
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:12,880
not bad.

923
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,840
It's, you just gotta give it a try.

924
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:20,040
The teleporting in previous editions, especially in 3rd, was crazy.

925
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:25,000
It got to the point where a party would teleport, would scry, teleport, and kill the main boss

926
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:30,320
and that was your whole campaign in the teen levels, and of course 3.5 D&D tended to break,

927
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:35,800
the entire system broke around 16th to 18th level, um, because they just hadn't, it was

928
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,800
a design thing.

929
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:41,400
Yeah, what it kind of reminded me of was the difference between, you know, wow in the early

930
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:45,160
levels is, you know, kind of alright, you know, you're not, you know, you don't have

931
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:48,160
a lot of things, but you can still, you know, level up pretty quickly.

932
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:53,120
You know, with 4th ed, it almost reminds me of the first couple levels of Final Fantasy

933
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,120
11.

934
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:56,120
Until you get to 10, you're crap.

935
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,120
Yeah.

936
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:03,360
One of the big misconceptions about 4th edition is it's, it's like a, it's an MMO on tabletop.

937
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,960
No it's not an MMO on tabletop.

938
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,800
Yes, they share terminology with World of Warcraft.

939
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:14,640
It makes it convenient, but you can still do, this is not a ding on, on computer console

940
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:18,480
games, but you can still do more because you have a living person who can keep making up

941
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,480
the story.

942
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,000
You're only limited by your imagination.

943
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Yes, exactly.

944
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Whereas, you know.

945
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,880
And a good DM knows what rules to edit.

946
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:25,880
That's right.

947
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:29,680
Well yes, and you know, house rules in a, in a home game is the name of the game.

948
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:36,520
So I mean, you can change the system to a point, if there's something that somebody

949
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,840
wants to do.

950
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:40,240
You know, it's just, it depends on what you like.

951
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:43,980
I mean, people who don't like 4th edition go play Pathfinder, that's fine.

952
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:44,980
No problem there.

953
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:49,900
I'm glad Taizo was around to put out an alternative for the folks that didn't like the genre shift.

954
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:52,680
But I enjoy 4th.

955
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:58,800
I'm hoping that they'll license or put out a computer game based on the 4th edition rules

956
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:04,080
but I know Wizards of the Coast was having some issues with Atari as their game publisher.

957
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:07,400
I don't know if those got worked out yet or not.

958
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:13,600
But I like 4th edition, I also like hero games, superheroes, champions.

959
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,920
I play champions.

960
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:19,940
Champions is fun but it's a very, very hidden numbers heavy game.

961
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:26,000
I'm not a math guy so I need a character generator to keep the stuff straight but eh.

962
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:33,320
You know, I haven't played the champions online MMO, I'm told it's very different in its mechanics

963
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:37,800
and they just licensed, actually they bought the champions name from hero games and then

964
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,480
licensed it back to them.

965
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:40,480
It's an interesting arrangement.

966
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,480
Ooh, amazing.

967
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:48,160
Yep, I talked to Steve Long, one of the hero lead designers at length, well actually not

968
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:53,880
at length briefly, at the last convention I was at, I think that was Kublai Khan or

969
00:42:53,880 --> 00:43:01,120
Dunder Khan in February and he explained how that worked out, it's kind of interesting.

970
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:07,860
But yeah, they got 6th edition hero now is the current edition of that and I have yet

971
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:12,560
to play it but I'm looking forward to doing something different than D&D very soon.

972
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:17,000
I've been playing Dungeons and Dragons since 3rd edition came out, pretty much uninterrupted

973
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
straight.

974
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Wow.

975
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Dedication.

976
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,600
You kind of get tired of it after a little while.

977
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:26,760
I just, it's the fantasy thing, I'm ready for a genre shift myself.

978
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:29,160
I want to do a nice steampunk game.

979
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:32,140
Let me get to some comments from our chatroom at chat.orangetonstrategy.com, without turning

980
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:35,480
into a tabletop gaming show, although it is important, you know, a lot of computer games

981
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:39,440
we play today are inspired, like champions online is a perfect example, directly inspired

982
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,140
by the tabletop universe.

983
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:43,700
Well without D&D you wouldn't have World of Warcraft.

984
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:45,000
No way.

985
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,920
Or probably even stuff like Final Fantasy.

986
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:47,920
Nope.

987
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:52,160
Let's see, comments from our chatroom at chat.orangetonstrategy.com, Shauran says that's not why 4th edition

988
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,160
isn't as good.

989
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:55,440
It's not as good because there's next to no customization.

990
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:56,440
That's not true.

991
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:57,440
Oh boy.

992
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,440
Alright.

993
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:00,440
How about we save the debate for another time.

994
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:01,440
Alright, yes.

995
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,520
Monty Boggs says, none of my group wants to spend money on the new books, so we haven't

996
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:06,520
upgraded.

997
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:10,500
Shauran clarified though, at least in terms of skills and multi-classing.

998
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:11,500
That's also...

999
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:13,500
No fan of the Flames.

1000
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:18,100
I will leave it at this, I still love 2nd edition for a reason.

1001
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:19,100
Take your THAC0 and shove it.

1002
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:20,100
Yes I have.

1003
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:22,920
Hey, I can calculate my THAC0 in my sleep, sir.

1004
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:26,000
THAC0 and low saving throws, high attack rolls, yes.

1005
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,400
Camara says, the 4th edition book talked down to me like I was a child.

1006
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:33,280
This is what the dice looks like, this is how you roll it.

1007
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:36,120
Yeah, that's a problem I've always had with Wizards of the Coast.

1008
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:38,240
They don't write very well.

1009
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,320
The game books aren't written very flavorfully.

1010
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:41,880
We miss you TSR.

1011
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:45,440
Yeah, well actually, that's one thing I like about White Wolf.

1012
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:51,560
At least the old World of Darkness, the vampire, the werewolf books were written very flavorfully.

1013
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:54,720
You actually could feel the world when you were reading it.

1014
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:58,320
Yeah, and then they switched to New World and there was much sighing and...

1015
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,320
We won't talk about New World.

1016
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:00,320
We don't talk about New World.

1017
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:01,320
Gnashing of teeth.

1018
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:03,120
We don't talk about New World of Darkness.

1019
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:04,840
It's a scientist left in the closet.

1020
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:07,320
We just made GFD happy because we're talking about New World of Darkness.

1021
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:11,440
I'm pleasantly surprised at what a warm reception the tabletop chat is getting from our chat

1022
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:12,440
room.

1023
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:15,520
It seems to have a tabletop corner or something in the future, I don't know.

1024
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:16,520
Alright.

1025
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:17,520
I'll do it.

1026
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:18,520
Yeah, TSR is dead.

1027
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:22,160
They died of their own money grubbing but unfortunately it looks like Wizards of the

1028
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:23,680
Coast might be going the same way.

1029
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:24,680
Eh, that's life.

1030
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:27,880
Alright, let's get into some housekeeping here so we can get to the video game news

1031
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:28,880
of the week.

1032
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:31,240
Housekeeping going on here at Orange Lounge Radio.

1033
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:35,280
I mentioned a Facebook ad campaign earlier and just to tell you guys what's going on,

1034
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:40,100
it doesn't really directly affect the show but we decided to try a little something something.

1035
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:41,600
We don't make any money doing OLR.

1036
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:42,960
I want to make that very clear.

1037
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:43,960
We don't have ads during the show.

1038
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:44,960
We don't have any on the site.

1039
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:45,960
Money?

1040
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:46,960
Really?

1041
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:47,960
I know.

1042
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:50,320
We don't make, we haven't for eight years made money doing OLR.

1043
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:55,120
So the only exception would be like donations which we, we don't actively solicit them at

1044
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:56,120
all.

1045
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:58,440
We don't have like a PayPal link or anything but you know, folks in the past have donated

1046
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:03,700
generously to the show and you know, that's kept us definitely going via bandwidth, time,

1047
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:04,700
whatever it is.

1048
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:06,460
Not necessarily just money.

1049
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:09,520
But we decided what the hell, let's take you know, ten bucks.

1050
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:13,660
We can find ten bucks and see what happens if we throw it into a Facebook ad campaign.

1051
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:17,640
And so thanks to any of you new guys we got from that.

1052
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:23,320
I know it, it, you know, it got us a little bit of extra exposure so we're thinking about

1053
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:24,720
doing more stuff like that in the future.

1054
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:25,720
I don't know.

1055
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:26,720
Exposure, exposure, exposure.

1056
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:28,320
We'll see.

1057
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:29,760
So maybe more of that in the future.

1058
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:30,760
I don't know.

1059
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:35,400
But do join our Facebook community if you're not already on there, www.facebook.com slash

1060
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:37,320
Orange Lounge Radio.

1061
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:38,320
We're also on Twitter.

1062
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:39,320
We'll be taking Twitter topics later.

1063
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:40,920
We're also on Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

1064
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:41,920
Alright.

1065
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:45,480
So, that's all I have for Housekeeping tonight.

1066
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:47,400
So why don't we get into some actual gaming news?

1067
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:48,400
Yay!

1068
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:53,680
We're going to start off tonight with a story on Starcraft 2.

1069
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:57,160
Starcraft 2 obviously is the big thing in gaming this week, although I personally have

1070
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:58,160
not played it.

1071
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,960
You've definitely heard some comments from chatters and Jamie watching Dan play and some

1072
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:01,960
other stuff.

1073
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:03,800
Exactly how big was Starcraft 2?

1074
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:11,760
Well, according to a report at vgcharts.com, Starcraft 2 sold 1.8 million copies on day

1075
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:12,760
one.

1076
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:14,760
That's not counting Korea, just so you know.

1077
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:15,760
That's not counting Korea?

1078
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:16,760
Not counting Korea.

1079
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:17,760
Okay.

1080
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:20,520
So, 1.8 million on the first day.

1081
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:23,200
That's Americas and Europe.

1082
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:27,000
Keep in mind though, I want to say, didn't World of Warcraft sell a little more?

1083
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:31,140
It's for, not original wow, but like Wrath of the Lich King sold what, like 2.8 I think

1084
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:32,140
on day one?

1085
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:33,140
Yeah.

1086
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:35,560
Do you have some other numbers for context of that?

1087
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:38,640
I want to say World of Warcraft Wrath of the Lich King, yeah.

1088
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:43,160
It's here later in the story, 2.8 million units on day one as well, and that's another

1089
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:44,160
Blizzard game.

1090
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,280
But here's the difference.

1091
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:51,800
With an MMO, especially one like wow, there's this huge need to be the first person on the

1092
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:54,000
server at level 80, you know what I mean?

1093
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,080
So there's a lot of people who want to go out and get it right away.

1094
00:47:57,080 --> 00:48:00,560
Starcraft 2 I think is a little different because I don't think everybody needs to jump

1095
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:01,560
on board with that.

1096
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:05,320
You can jump in right away, but you know I was lining up, well I didn't actually, I didn't

1097
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:09,040
line up for Wrath of the Lich King, I just went and got it the next day.

1098
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:12,280
But there's a lot of people I think that are just kind of chilling with Starcraft 2, like

1099
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:13,280
they don't have to get it right now.

1100
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:14,280
Yeah.

1101
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:17,560
They can wait a little bit, or at least for a price drop, but then again, with Blizzard,

1102
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:18,560
good luck.

1103
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:19,560
Yeah.

1104
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:20,560
Good luck on that.

1105
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:21,560
They're still charging 20 bucks for Diablo 2.

1106
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:26,640
Yeah, I never heard anyone stressing over missing a raid in anything but World of Warcraft.

1107
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:35,240
Yeah, as far as the original Starcraft goes, I actually got my copy from a friend who actually

1108
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:41,100
bet me money for whether or not I could beat him at Starcraft.

1109
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:45,240
And I didn't know the game, so he's like, here you borrow my copy.

1110
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:48,800
And then I played Zerg and whipped him good, so that teaches him.

1111
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:53,880
I'm watching the trailer for Starcraft 2, Wings of Liberty, Ghosts of the Past.

1112
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:54,880
Looks intriguing.

1113
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:58,400
Wow, that's an interesting monster.

1114
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:59,960
Hurry for the Zerg.

1115
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:01,320
Hurry for the Zerg.

1116
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:05,440
I don't know how I feel about this whole splitting it up into three games, though, because really,

1117
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:06,760
you know, I don't know.

1118
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:07,760
It's...

1119
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:14,720
Well, even for splitting it up into three games, you know, they still gave some outrageous

1120
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:19,560
additions to some of the other, you know, like the Zerg, like the Protoss, you know,

1121
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:23,680
the exploding Zerglings I absolutely love.

1122
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:28,400
I don't know enough about the Starcraft universe to even profess to say, oh, this is a good

1123
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:33,400
idea or no, but I kind of think, like, okay, kind of going from that wow fanboy perspective

1124
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:36,840
of maybe these are more like expansion packs.

1125
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:41,400
These future releases are kind of like expansion packs in a way, but they're also standal...

1126
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:45,440
Because, like, I could totally just skip this game and buy the Zerg game, right?

1127
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,520
Because the next one's the Zerg game.

1128
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:48,520
And then I could just...

1129
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:49,520
Oh, the next one is the Zerg.

1130
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:50,840
I believe the next one's the Zerg game.

1131
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:53,280
And then I could just Zerg all night and all day.

1132
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:54,280
All day.

1133
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:56,440
And still do multiplayer like everyone else, right?

1134
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:57,440
Mm-hmm.

1135
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:58,440
Yeah.

1136
00:49:58,440 --> 00:49:59,440
Interesting.

1137
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:00,440
Very much so.

1138
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:04,400
It's a strange experiment they're trying, and it's getting them a lot of crap.

1139
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:07,680
You know, there's a lot of people really pooping on Starcraft 2 because of the whole lack of

1140
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:09,480
land support, but that's...

1141
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:10,480
I hate to say it.

1142
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,480
I think it's more of a vocal minority than anything else.

1143
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:13,480
Yeah.

1144
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:14,880
I don't think it's anything to take.

1145
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:15,880
Yeah.

1146
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:16,880
The...

1147
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:20,120
Some of the, you know, looking at all the additions of what they made from the original

1148
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:27,400
game to the new game, it really makes each of the races a little more versatile.

1149
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:32,040
Because with the original Zergs, you really only had one option.

1150
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:33,040
Zerg Rush.

1151
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:34,040
That was it.

1152
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:42,160
That was the only way to really make a dent into the opposing sides and to really thrive

1153
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:43,600
was just Zerg Rush.

1154
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:45,560
And that was really your only tactic.

1155
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:53,680
With the new additions that they have, like the Explodes, Zerg lingo boom, is...

1156
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:59,840
It makes for a really interesting new way of playing for those people who are just used

1157
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:05,960
to one style for, you know, for, you know, the individuals like the Protoss, like the

1158
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:06,960
Terrans.

1159
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:10,520
Well, stepping away a little bit from the gameplay for a minute here to talk numbers

1160
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:14,960
again, because I think this is very interesting and could be very telling for the future.

1161
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:21,520
Now again, this report on VGcharts.com is estimating that 31% of those units were sold

1162
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,520
on Battle.net.

1163
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:29,680
Meaning that about a third was all digital distribution directly through Battle.net.

1164
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:31,360
That could be very...

1165
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:34,200
It's almost a telling sign of where GameStop's gonna be in 10 years.

1166
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:38,640
So do you think DVDs, games on DVD, CD are gonna be obsolete and you just download it

1167
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:39,640
in the future?

1168
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:43,400
How long do you think it's gonna take, because obviously it is gonna happen.

1169
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:46,320
Well, have CDs gone obsolete yet?

1170
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:47,320
No, not yet.

1171
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:50,120
They've had unexpected longevity somehow.

1172
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:54,160
They've been punched and kicked and throttled and had their hair pulled.

1173
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:55,160
Pretty much.

1174
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:56,160
But they're not dead yet.

1175
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:57,160
And I think...

1176
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:58,160
They're not dead yet.

1177
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,160
CDs are...

1178
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:00,160
They're not getting better though.

1179
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:04,240
CDs are kind of where, right now, I think you can kind of look to that to see a little

1180
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:05,720
bit about where gaming's going.

1181
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:08,280
Well, here's my parallel.

1182
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:09,640
Newspapers and online.

1183
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:10,840
Yes.

1184
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:14,880
Super circulation is down so far, so fast.

1185
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:16,560
Newsweek is up for sale.

1186
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:17,560
But they're not all dead yet.

1187
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:18,560
No, they're not all dead yet.

1188
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:22,600
And major dailies are hurting, like the Washington Post and the New York Times, but they're not

1189
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:23,680
gone.

1190
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:25,080
So we'll see what form they take.

1191
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:29,480
The iPad might have something to say about what form they take in the future.

1192
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:30,480
We'll see how that goes.

1193
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,600
Or the Amazon Kindle.

1194
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:34,320
The Kindle, yes.

1195
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:36,080
And also Sony has another e-reader.

1196
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:37,080
I forgot what it was called.

1197
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:38,760
Sony's e-reader's actually really, really nice.

1198
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:39,760
Okay.

1199
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:40,760
I've never seen it, so I don't know anything about it.

1200
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:42,240
One of my friends in my class has one.

1201
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:43,240
Okay.

1202
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:44,240
Which she reads books under the table during class.

1203
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:46,240
My mom has a Kindle and swears by it.

1204
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:49,720
I have the Kindle app on my iPhone, and I absolutely love it.

1205
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:57,760
And keep in mind, I'm trying to go into publication for my field when I'm out of school.

1206
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:05,080
And thankfully, there's jobs out there for online publication as well as print publications.

1207
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:06,480
Besides just blogging.

1208
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:10,920
If you know how to do them both, you're in a good place.

1209
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:11,920
Okay.

1210
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:12,920
Mm-hmm.

1211
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:13,920
Yeah, definitely.

1212
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:14,920
And I've thankfully been printed before.

1213
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:15,920
Yay.

1214
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:16,920
Ooh.

1215
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:17,920
Right here.

1216
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:18,920
La-di-da.

1217
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:19,920
All right.

1218
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:27,440
I hate to do this, but I have actually breaking news, a special report we have to go to.

1219
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:34,320
Live, late breaking news, you guys.

1220
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:35,820
Very important.

1221
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:38,920
There's just been a post on Facebook.

1222
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:41,920
Joshua Hunter was born at 5.14 PM.

1223
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:42,920
Yay.

1224
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:44,920
So congratulations to Loki.

1225
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:46,920
And there was much rejoicing.

1226
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:47,920
Yay.

1227
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:48,920
Congratulations.

1228
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:53,520
And I actually think I just saw something in the orange lounge from Kitsune.

1229
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:56,400
Yeah, that's how I knew to look.

1230
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:57,400
So yeah.

1231
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,400
Because they're able to refresh a little faster.

1232
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:00,400
Okay.

1233
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:01,400
I'm just making sure you're watching.

1234
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:02,400
Oh, it's so cute.

1235
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:03,400
I know, right?

1236
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:04,400
So there you go.

1237
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:05,400
Look at that little one.

1238
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:06,400
Wow.

1239
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:08,840
She couldn't have waited one more hour to have the baby during OLR.

1240
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:10,840
Now it's a Bobby Black Wolf baby.

1241
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:11,840
I'm sorry.

1242
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:12,840
Babies wait for no one.

1243
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:13,840
I'm kidding.

1244
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:20,200
I'm sure Nellie's like, get this child out of me.

1245
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:21,200
There it is.

1246
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:23,280
That's my impression of Nellie in childbirth.

1247
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,840
The baby kind of looks like Nellie.

1248
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:26,840
Really?

1249
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:27,840
Yeah.

1250
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:28,840
He does.

1251
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:32,480
I think he's got, though, you see that turn of his mouth?

1252
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:33,480
Yeah.

1253
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:34,480
That's totally Loki.

1254
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:35,480
You can definitely see.

1255
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:38,680
But he's got, I think he's got Nellie's nose.

1256
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:39,680
So there you go.

1257
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:40,680
All right.

1258
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:44,320
Sorry to interrupt the show, but that was definitely worth interrupting a show for.

1259
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:49,240
I wonder if they're going to have a bris for him, and then I feel really sorry.

1260
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:50,800
Final Fantasy VII victory dance.

1261
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:51,800
Wow, that brings back memories.

1262
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:52,800
I know.

1263
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:54,800
I should have found that music.

1264
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:55,800
All right.

1265
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:59,920
Well, any more baby news we get during the show, we'll bring to you, okay?

1266
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:00,920
Yay.

1267
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:01,920
All right.

1268
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:02,920
He's so pretty.

1269
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:03,920
And he's got red hair.

1270
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:04,920
Yeah.

1271
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:05,920
We're just glad that Starcraft didn't lay an egg.

1272
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:06,920
Oh.

1273
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:07,920
Ouch.

1274
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:08,920
Where's my?

1275
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:09,920
Yeah.

1276
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:10,920
Too soon.

1277
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:11,920
All right.

1278
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:12,920
Moving on.

1279
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:13,920
Where's my rimshot?

1280
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:14,920
Wow.

1281
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:19,320
Drew Nami's like, how long before he's eating super bacon?

1282
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:20,320
Too soon, you guys.

1283
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:21,320
Good God.

1284
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:22,320
Be happy for 24 hours.

1285
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:23,320
All right.

1286
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:26,720
I know Act F has a point there.

1287
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:28,800
It's the first, the first OLR baby.

1288
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:33,440
Well, I can, I can, I gave a congratulations to his sperm and Nellie's hard work.

1289
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:36,920
Loki and Nellie were only dating when the show started.

1290
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:37,920
All right.

1291
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:38,920
Seriously.

1292
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:39,920
Who did all the work?

1293
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:40,920
That's not, I'm not saying you're wrong.

1294
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:41,920
I'm not saying you're wrong.

1295
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:45,840
You know, I was, there's actually, there's a comedian I like called Henry Cho, who's

1296
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:49,000
a Korean guy from Tennessee, so he sounds totally Tennessee.

1297
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:53,280
I just want to remind the new listeners, last week we talked about games, the week before

1298
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:54,280
we had a lot of game content.

1299
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:55,280
Now there's a baby.

1300
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:57,280
Normally we talk about games, we swear.

1301
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:01,040
But, but I like it how he came home and the house was a mess, he asked his wife, he's

1302
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:02,520
like, man, the house is a mess.

1303
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:03,520
What'd you do?

1304
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:06,440
Well, let's see, today I made a lung.

1305
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:08,560
When you make body parts, let me know.

1306
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:09,560
So.

1307
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:11,440
All right.

1308
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:12,680
Can I talk Starcraft 2?

1309
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:13,680
Yeah.

1310
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:14,680
Are you sure?

1311
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:15,680
Go ahead.

1312
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:16,680
All right.

1313
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:20,440
Starcraft 2.

1314
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:25,440
One thing that is supposedly, I guess, coming to Starcraft 2 in the future, I guess it was

1315
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:29,660
supposed to be there when it launched, but it didn't make it, is chat rooms.

1316
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:30,660
That's right.

1317
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:32,080
You were supposed to have chat rooms in Starcraft 2.

1318
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:36,160
It's not there yet, but it's going to be added in a later patch, and that is per a forum

1319
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:40,160
post from one of the community managers over at Blizzard.

1320
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:44,000
The chat room is going to be, quote, based around groups where you will be able to join

1321
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,000
public channels that are based around your interests.

1322
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,320
Sounds like it's going to be like AOL.

1323
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:49,320
Yay.

1324
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:50,320
No.

1325
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:51,320
I'm kidding.

1326
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:52,480
Is that a good thing?

1327
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:53,800
I don't think so.

1328
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:57,920
There will be private chat rooms as well if you are so inclined, or you could always use

1329
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:02,440
real ID if you don't mind your last name being plastered all over the internet.

1330
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:03,440
Yay.

1331
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:04,440
There you go.

1332
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:05,440
Which is why I use an alias.

1333
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:06,440
There you go.

1334
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:10,400
I tried, but Blizzard just took it right off my credit card and was like, oh hey, this

1335
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:11,400
must be your name.

1336
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:12,400
Aw.

1337
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:13,400
All right.

1338
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:14,400
Man, I know.

1339
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:16,800
Anyhow, that's in the future for Starcraft 2.

1340
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:18,800
DarkSakura, what do you got for us?

1341
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:19,800
Baby.

1342
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:21,800
I knew this was going to happen.

1343
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:22,800
He's obsessed.

1344
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:23,800
Thank you, everybody.

1345
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:24,800
We'll see you next week.

1346
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:26,800
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1347
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:27,800
No, no.

1348
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:29,800
The little bombs started ticking really hardcore.

1349
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:30,800
Anyway.

1350
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:31,800
Aw.

1351
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:33,800
Did you feel a Twitter in your, or Twitter.

1352
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:35,800
Did you feel a Twitter in your uterus?

1353
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:41,240
Well, I was actually thinking of Kathy Griffin, so was it a Twitter in the twat?

1354
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:43,040
Oh, too soon.

1355
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:44,040
Ouch.

1356
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:45,040
Where is that rim shot?

1357
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:47,040
Rob's got the sad trombone.

1358
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:48,040
No, no, no.

1359
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:49,040
I got it right here.

1360
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:50,040
I just did.

1361
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:51,040
Uh.

1362
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:52,040
Anyway.

1363
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:53,040
Keep going?

1364
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:58,480
Anyway, remember we were talking a while back about the R4 being banned, being that that's

1365
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:06,040
the little memory card reader thing for the Nintendo DS so that you could play ROMs, or

1366
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:09,480
copies of games, or bootleg games.

1367
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:10,480
Um.

1368
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:11,480
Bootleg?

1369
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:17,420
So, there has, well, I've got a Ninja Pass, so I don't want to talk, but anyway, I really

1370
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:18,720
got it for all my imports.

1371
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:19,720
It's not mine, officer.

1372
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:20,720
I swear.

1373
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:28,240
But anyway, anyway, they actually, there's been released, they were banned in the UK,

1374
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:31,800
and now there's a bit more information that's put out about it.

1375
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:37,800
They basically said that it was actually related to a number of different devices that were

1376
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:45,800
sold by Playables, which is the company that they banned was Playables Limited.

1377
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:50,120
There are, the devices are defined, and this is a quote, enabled Nintendo DS users to play

1378
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:54,800
unlawful copies of Nintendo DS games with which they have downloaded using the internet.

1379
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:55,800
Ooh, naughty, naughty.

1380
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:58,800
That's what Nintendo means about game copiers.

1381
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:04,720
But the things that really make it illegal, and this is actually on the list are the R4

1382
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:12,520
DS, M3 DS, DS1 Supercard, DSTT, DS Linker, Ace Card, Cyclo DS, Evolution, N5, and EZ

1383
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:13,520
devices.

1384
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:14,520
You didn't mention the Ninja Pass.

1385
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:15,520
So all the fun stuff.

1386
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:16,520
They didn't mention the Ninja Pass, so I'm cool.

1387
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:18,520
Yeah, they always make the good stuff illegal.

1388
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:23,200
But all of these are ones that use the micro SD flash card.

1389
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:29,280
And the argument though, well basically, Nintendo's claim was that it was in violation of the

1390
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:34,000
Copyright Designs and Patents Act of 1998 in the UK.

1391
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:45,760
And the argument that Playables put up was basically that it was to play homebrew games.

1392
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:55,240
Basically the whole big thing is that the device circumvents Nintendo's machine.

1393
00:59:55,240 --> 01:00:01,440
Any of the programming built into it that's there on purpose.

1394
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:06,400
And so basically, all of these things, the different encryptions, different things that

1395
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:13,080
Nintendo built into the hardware to protect from being able to use bootlegs and whatnot.

1396
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:15,040
The device is supposed to counteract them.

1397
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:21,160
So that's a big thing that Nintendo's got a bug up their butt about.

1398
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:28,240
And according to Nintendo, they've seized more than 165,000 game copiers that were intended

1399
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:30,640
for Playables.

1400
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:37,440
And so basically, that was the whole deal about it.

1401
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:43,820
Even though there's a bunch of other cool things you can do with them, the whole big

1402
01:00:43,820 --> 01:00:50,240
thing has to do with circumventing their hardware.

1403
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:53,880
I get that and all, but doesn't this seem a little throwing out the baby with the bath

1404
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:55,480
water to you?

1405
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:57,160
No pun intended.

1406
01:00:57,160 --> 01:01:01,440
Because this is where...

1407
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:05,880
They're saying that since you can use this device to pirate games, it shouldn't be out

1408
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:06,880
there on the market.

1409
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:11,880
But I can use my computer to pirate games, does that mean my computer should be banned?

1410
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:14,540
I mean, it's more about what you use it for.

1411
01:01:14,540 --> 01:01:18,360
And the good thing about the R4 is that it does open it up to homebrew.

1412
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:20,980
Now of course, I can see both sides of it.

1413
01:01:20,980 --> 01:01:24,440
There's a lot of people that can sit there and go, okay, you know damn well there's plenty

1414
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:27,360
of people that buy those R4s that aren't using it for homebrew.

1415
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:29,400
They are using it for the malicious purpose.

1416
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:30,400
So it's tough.

1417
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:31,400
It's like, where do you draw the line?

1418
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:35,460
I don't know.

1419
01:01:35,460 --> 01:01:45,120
That's a tough call, because with the gaming community, that kind of stuff is really hard

1420
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:46,120
to call.

1421
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:54,360
Because you've got the regular honest gamers who actually buy their stuff, and they don't

1422
01:01:54,360 --> 01:02:00,360
get access to this because just a bunch of people decided, oh, we're going to steal games.

1423
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:05,960
So it's not fair to both the legitimate players, as well as the guys who are doing the stuff.

1424
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:09,840
So it's, you know, either way, it's a bad deal.

1425
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:15,080
You see, if Nintendo would open up the DS to homebrew, not that I see them ever doing

1426
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:18,720
that, but if they were to do something like that, you know, this cart wouldn't really

1427
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:23,680
have a lot of leg to stand on, because its only purpose would be for something shady.

1428
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:28,040
But I get it, Nintendo doesn't want to open that up, because then, you know, there's going

1429
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:30,080
to be all sorts of scary homebrew.

1430
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:34,960
Well there would be homebrew to play, you know, Sony PS1 games on your DS, or something

1431
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:36,040
like that, you know what I mean?

1432
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:37,840
Which would just be horrible!

1433
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:40,360
I know, right?

1434
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:44,000
How many people originally bought a PSP to play the NES emulator that was out at the

1435
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,000
time?

1436
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:48,240
Well, I didn't buy one, but yeah.

1437
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:52,160
And that's another thing, like, games that strictly come out for the PSP.

1438
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:58,560
Like Dissidia, or Birth by Sleep.

1439
01:02:58,560 --> 01:03:04,360
You know, both of those games that just came out for the PSP, you know, if it wasn't for

1440
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:07,940
emulators, most of us wouldn't be able to play those games.

1441
01:03:07,940 --> 01:03:13,500
Because we're not going to plunker down $120 just to buy a console for a game for two games

1442
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:15,560
that we're going to play.

1443
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:17,040
It's just ridiculous.

1444
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:20,720
So it's part of the reason why I didn't play Kingdom Hearts Chain of Memories, is because

1445
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:21,720
I didn't own a DS.

1446
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:25,400
Yeah, but at the same time, emulators, especially to play current games, are like super duper

1447
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:27,720
illegal and just as bad as what they're banning.

1448
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:31,960
I mean, at least know what, you know, that it is what it is.

1449
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:37,560
Well, at least with the R4 and those devices, they are contingent on you having the system.

1450
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:38,560
Mm-hmm.

1451
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:39,560
True.

1452
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:40,560
Yeah.

1453
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:41,560
Yeah.

1454
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:42,560
Was there more you wanted to say there, Jamie?

1455
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:43,560
I thought I heard you turning it up.

1456
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:48,000
No, it was just quoting other cases in Europe that were, you know, had to do with reel-to-reel

1457
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:53,000
tape copiers, but said that this was far worse because it did actually go right on the edge

1458
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,160
of copyright infringement.

1459
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:58,480
All right, well look, if you want something for free, here's something new that's going

1460
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:01,640
to be for free that doesn't involve questionable legality things.

1461
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:03,600
This is a totally legit thing.

1462
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:06,680
EverQuest 2 is soon going to have a free model.

1463
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:07,680
What?

1464
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:10,880
Yeah, EverQuest 2 is getting EverQuest 2 extended.

1465
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:14,880
Now here's the thing though, this is not like when Lords of the Ring, or was it, yeah, Lords

1466
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:17,280
of the Rings opened up, no, D&D opened up to free-to-play.

1467
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:19,680
Maybe Lords of the Ring did too, I can't remember.

1468
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:23,320
Yeah, DDO opened up to win free, but there's, you know, you still have to, certain things

1469
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:25,960
you still have to pay for in the game, but yeah.

1470
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:29,440
And that's something, somewhat what's going to happen here too, but EverQuest 2 is getting

1471
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:36,920
a free-to-play version, so there's going to be, EverQuest 2 will still exist as it does

1472
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:42,920
today, but they're going to launch, kind of next door, EverQuest 2 extended, so it's kind

1473
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:44,920
of like a parallel universe, if you will.

1474
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:48,920
It's going to use a web-based application, there will be free and there will be optional

1475
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:53,640
paid memberships, you can buy equipment in the game, but you still get access to all

1476
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:58,100
the zones that you have right now, there's this whole FAQ up on the website, they do

1477
01:04:58,100 --> 01:05:02,120
plan to launch this in mid-August, but it's interesting because they show all these different

1478
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:03,480
types of plans.

1479
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:08,120
You can get a free plan for bronze, what they call the bronze level is free, there's a silver

1480
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:14,280
plan that's a $10 one-time purchase that gets you more character slots, more, let's see,

1481
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:19,520
I'm trying to see what else, you get more spells opened up, you get more bag slots and

1482
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:25,400
so forth, more, you do get limits on your coins, but that goes up at the silver level,

1483
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:31,080
or you can pay $15 a month for the gold level, which gets you, I imagine, pretty much everything

1484
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:36,320
you get with EverQuest 2, or if you want, you can plunk down $200 for a full year.

1485
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:43,760
You've got to be really dedicated for that, but $200 across a year is $18 a month, but

1486
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:47,240
that's like the Uber access where you have unlimited everything.

1487
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:48,240
Interesting tactic.

1488
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:50,800
I don't know if there'll be a lot of platinum and gold players on there, because I think

1489
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:54,720
they would be all in regular EverQuest, but I bet you'd get a lot of bronze and maybe

1490
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:55,720
even some silvers.

1491
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:59,360
And that isn't going to cross over with the regular EverQuest 2, that's going to be its

1492
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:00,880
own separate thing.

1493
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:05,760
That's what they're saying now, but my curiosity is, well then what if one population starts

1494
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:09,320
to really off-balance the other, is there a possibility they might merge them later

1495
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:10,320
on?

1496
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:15,400
I was reading on this thing about if you've already got an existing subscription for EverQuest,

1497
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:17,280
then you basically get a gold account.

1498
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:21,760
Okay, that's what I figured, is that if you're already paying them $15 a month, that's probably

1499
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:24,320
what the regular ones are paying them.

1500
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:27,360
Interesting though, that not only have they launched, and maybe this is the unreported

1501
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:32,920
part of the story, is that not only have they launched a free, but they've also launched

1502
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:36,200
a pay us more version with that platinum tier.

1503
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:39,880
Is it more expensive than the regular games monthly subscription?

1504
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:43,600
I think the regular games monthly is the same as that gold, $15 a month, at least that's

1505
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:48,160
like the average MMO subscription, but $200 a year, I mean that's not as terrible as it

1506
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:54,080
sounds because you have to divide 200 by 12, so it's about what, maybe 18 a month?

1507
01:06:54,080 --> 01:06:57,240
So it's not terrible.

1508
01:06:57,240 --> 01:07:03,580
You know, how you were saying with the going to free to play, I, when I actually had the

1509
01:07:03,580 --> 01:07:08,840
power on my computer to do it, I used to play this game Cartoon Network's Fusion Fall.

1510
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:11,240
Don't knock it till you've tried it.

1511
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:18,040
We're big fans of Robot Unicorn Attack here, so yeah, definitely play those games.

1512
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:23,360
The Cartoon Network Universe MMO, originally when it first came out, you would have the

1513
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:31,240
future levels, which was like about five sections of the world, and you know, a couple of quests

1514
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:36,280
and things like that, and then in order to go to the past, was a whole new world.

1515
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:43,040
It was a totally expanded world, and that was like 15 a month, and now, I think it was

1516
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:49,880
back in April, they went completely free to play, and they're, they literally skyrocketed

1517
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:53,600
their membership because they finally went free to play, because a lot of us who really

1518
01:07:53,600 --> 01:08:03,480
enjoyed the game were pissed that it, that most of the game cost you money, because you

1519
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:05,880
know, me being a poor gamer, you know?

1520
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:09,400
I am totally against paying any sort of money for a game.

1521
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:11,120
Okay, within ten dollars.

1522
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:15,320
Well, there's a lot of people listening that are probably in the same boat you are, but

1523
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:21,200
there's a shout out coming here from GioVedea in our chatroom at chat.orangelandraday.com.

1524
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:26,680
Fusion Fall is amazing, VidPower in our chatroom says those old Cartoon Network Toonami Flash

1525
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:30,760
games were great, Dark Tetsuya says an Adult Swim needs an MMO.

1526
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:36,400
Yeah, well, Fusion Fall is close enough to an Adult Swim MMO, because the graphics of

1527
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:42,320
the game really remind me of this wonderful artist called Bleedman, who's on DeviantArt,

1528
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:45,860
and look him up, he's awesome.

1529
01:08:45,860 --> 01:08:50,880
It's like making the cartoony, you know, like Dexter, not so cartoony, like he actually

1530
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:56,600
has a body, and hands, and arms, what a concept.

1531
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:57,600
Very cool.

1532
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:58,600
Yay.

1533
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:00,040
DarkSakura, what do you got next for us?

1534
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:01,880
Well, we have some other stuff.

1535
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:10,080
For fans of Force Unleashed, well, Force Unleashed 2 has been in development, except the executive

1536
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:11,080
producer quit.

1537
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:13,080
Oh no.

1538
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:18,600
Hayden Blackman resigned from LucasArts after being with them for thirteen years, and he

1539
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:21,460
just said it was time to go.

1540
01:09:21,460 --> 01:09:25,360
He was like, I am not putting Jar Jar Binks in my game, F you.

1541
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:30,240
Well, as a quote, while the decision to leave LucasArts did not happen overnight or come

1542
01:09:30,240 --> 01:09:35,680
easily, I really feel that now is the best time for me to move on and explore new creative

1543
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:39,880
challenges, and look forward to the next phase of my career, meaning, god, I hate this place,

1544
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:40,880
I want to quit.

1545
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:44,600
I know, like, totally reading through the lines, there's huge drama that went down that

1546
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:46,000
you're never going to know about.

1547
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,000
Yeah.

1548
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:52,160
And LucasArts is saying that his departure is not going to affect the game's development

1549
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:53,160
at all.

1550
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:54,160
Yeah.

1551
01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:55,920
No, it won't affect the quality at all.

1552
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:56,920
No.

1553
01:09:56,920 --> 01:09:57,920
Well, you never know.

1554
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:00,640
I mean, I know we're sitting here kind of poking fun, but it could get better.

1555
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:01,640
Who knows?

1556
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:04,160
And of course, you know, LucasArts left the dry.

1557
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:08,840
We are extremely grateful for his many contributions, fully support him in his new endeavors, and

1558
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:10,800
wish him all the best in the future.

1559
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:14,040
Because we're a company in California, and you're not allowed to say really anything

1560
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:19,200
bad about your previous employees, including the reasons why they left.

1561
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:22,280
By the way, I had a friend that worked at LucasArts, and she totally got me in the Skywalker

1562
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:23,280
Ranch.

1563
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:24,280
Whoa.

1564
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:25,280
You've been doing this on the show before.

1565
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:26,280
I'm always trying.

1566
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:28,600
Didn't you have George Lucas walk right by, and you said something about you want to fling

1567
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:29,600
your sandwich at him?

1568
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:32,120
I was in meatloaf-looking distance of George Lucas.

1569
01:10:32,120 --> 01:10:34,000
I've heard this story on the show before.

1570
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,000
I wanted my money back.

1571
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,000
Thank God for your self-restraint.

1572
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
What a concept.

1573
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:43,680
Anyhow, moving on to non-Star Wars-related news, but certainly another series has a lot

1574
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:44,680
of fans.

1575
01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:45,680
Halo.

1576
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:48,880
Of course, Halo Reach is on its way out a little later this year.

1577
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:52,240
What's very interesting, though, is that it was announced this week that Bungie, and this

1578
01:10:52,240 --> 01:10:57,880
was in an interview they had with Xbox 360 achievements, the website, talking about the

1579
01:10:57,880 --> 01:11:03,520
community director at Bungie, Brian Gerard, is saying that in Halo Reach, they're going

1580
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:07,280
to be doing something a little differently for you folks who like to quit your games

1581
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:08,280
early.

1582
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:11,960
Quote, I think one of the new things people will be excited about, too, is how we're going

1583
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:16,920
to be able to penalize people who are habitually quitting out of games, which isn't exactly

1584
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:21,560
cheating, but it creates a really negative experience for everybody else in the game.

1585
01:11:21,560 --> 01:11:23,280
So they're going to penalize rage quitting?

1586
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:24,280
Yes.

1587
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:25,280
Nice.

1588
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:30,280
We actually have new tools now to detect that, and eventually, people who do this habitually

1589
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:32,780
will actually be penalized.

1590
01:11:32,780 --> 01:11:37,680
We want to be able to remove them from the population so they can't make everyone else

1591
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:39,320
keep having a bad time.

1592
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:44,080
Now, of course, they don't elaborate on what exactly they're doing, but doesn't that sound

1593
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:49,160
to me like if you rage quit too much, you're going to get banished to Rage Quit Island,

1594
01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:51,820
where you will play with nothing but other rage quitters?

1595
01:11:51,820 --> 01:11:54,040
And not be allowed to rage quit.

1596
01:11:54,040 --> 01:11:56,120
That sounds kind of amazing, actually.

1597
01:11:56,120 --> 01:11:57,680
They should make them do Battle Royale.

1598
01:11:57,680 --> 01:11:59,120
For real.

1599
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:02,040
But at the same time, okay, they say they're going to be able to tell the difference between

1600
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:03,280
a rage quit and a disconnect.

1601
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:04,280
Well, let me tell you this.

1602
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:08,740
In Final Fantasy XI, my version of rage quit was to go turn off the cable modem.

1603
01:12:08,740 --> 01:12:14,280
So how would they know that that was, how did they know that that's me rage quitting

1604
01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:15,280
and not a disconnect?

1605
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:19,040
Like, you know, I get, like, backing out of a match and all that, or quitting or whatever,

1606
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:24,120
but how do they know the difference between that and a legitimate drop of the connection?

1607
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:26,720
Well, you know those wonderful ninja mods.

1608
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:28,920
You never know where they are.

1609
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:30,680
Maybe it could be the timing of it, too.

1610
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:35,600
Like if you are habitually always quitting when a certain circumstance is met, then that's

1611
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:38,520
when you get banished to Rage Quit Island or something.

1612
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:43,620
Like if, hmm, you're down and you always seem to lose your connection one minute before

1613
01:12:43,620 --> 01:12:48,000
the match is over, you're probably going to get targeted for exile, is my thought.

1614
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:51,960
Well, how do you know when somebody quits because they're, just because they're pissed

1615
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:54,880
and if somebody quits because they have a real emergency happening?

1616
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:58,160
I mean, obviously, that would be kind of rare, you'd hope, but, you know.

1617
01:12:58,160 --> 01:13:01,800
Well, now they do use the word habitual, so you would probably have to do it more than

1618
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:02,800
once, for sure.

1619
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:03,800
Okay.

1620
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:04,800
Let's see.

1621
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:08,000
Tigerclaw says, maybe someone with high pings lagging out and disconnecting.

1622
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:12,000
Ah, maybe kind of seeing, like, oh, the pings suddenly get slower and slower.

1623
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:15,400
That's a legitimate disconnect where somebody who just had a really good connection and

1624
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:17,720
suddenly, oop, it's gone, maybe a little less.

1625
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:23,760
I'd be very curious to see how this all plays out, how they're going to treat that.

1626
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:26,800
But I love the idea of making all the rage quitters play together on their own little

1627
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:30,200
island where they can all rage quit and, you know, go after themselves.

1628
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:32,680
It's like trapping a bunch of trolls on a single island.

1629
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:33,680
Exactly.

1630
01:13:33,680 --> 01:13:34,680
They kill each other.

1631
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:35,680
Wow.

1632
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:36,680
That's amazing.

1633
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:39,960
I love the idea of Xbox Live being like the continent of awesome people and then trolls

1634
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:41,200
banished to their own island.

1635
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:42,200
Sounds great to me.

1636
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:43,200
I wish you could do that on every single island.

1637
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:45,880
If they're trolls, they need to be banished to their own bridge.

1638
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:46,880
To go live under?

1639
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:50,200
As long as the bridge doesn't connect to anything, sure, I'm all for that.

1640
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:51,200
All right.

1641
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:55,480
We're going to move on to Dark Sakura with some gaming news, then we're going to get

1642
01:13:55,480 --> 01:13:57,600
into release dates in just a little bit here.

1643
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:00,480
Of course, the moment Rob says that, I dropped chips on the floor.

1644
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:01,480
I'm sorry, Dark Sakura.

1645
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:03,920
Well, you didn't make me drop the chips.

1646
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:04,920
That's right.

1647
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:05,920
You're just clumsy.

1648
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:06,920
My hand is broken.

1649
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:07,920
Knock it off.

1650
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:08,920
She has an excuse.

1651
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:09,920
Use your good hand.

1652
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:10,920
God gave you two.

1653
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:13,920
I need to go take some more Vicodin.

1654
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:14,920
Aw.

1655
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:18,040
Okay, Valve made a whoops.

1656
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:26,440
They banned 12,000 legitimate Modern Warfare 2 players.

1657
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:37,240
Basically the software that's in Steamworks to get the cheaters went on an extermination

1658
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:43,400
rampage and banned 12,000 players over the last two weeks.

1659
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:46,720
Basically what happened is that, and this is a quote from the email that was sent out

1660
01:14:46,720 --> 01:14:52,120
by Gabe Newell, who's the Valve president, the problem was that Steam would fail a signature

1661
01:14:52,120 --> 01:14:58,400
check between the disk version of a DLL and a latent memory version.

1662
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:02,520
So basically they said, you know, our bad, sorry.

1663
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:03,520
Whoops.

1664
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:04,520
I like that he's angst.

1665
01:15:04,520 --> 01:15:06,800
I apologize for any frustration or angst at me that's caused you.

1666
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:08,240
Haven't I ever seen angst in a professional shooter?

1667
01:15:08,240 --> 01:15:10,200
Can you all turn your caps lock off now?

1668
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:11,440
I know, right?

1669
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:20,800
So he's also promised a giftable copy of Left 4 Dead 2 to all of those affected, as well

1670
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:23,480
as a copy for themselves.

1671
01:15:23,480 --> 01:15:27,640
So if I get accidentally banned from a Steam game, I'm going to get two free copies of

1672
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:29,000
a game.

1673
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:30,000
One is giftable.

1674
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,000
Right.

1675
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:32,880
That's basically two free copies, right?

1676
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:34,680
One for you and one for someone you really like.

1677
01:15:34,680 --> 01:15:35,680
Yeah.

1678
01:15:35,680 --> 01:15:38,600
So hey, any of you that's been affected by this, gimme.

1679
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:39,600
Right?

1680
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:45,000
That's kind of where I'm at too, I'm like, you know, I have Left 4 Dead 1, but not 2.

1681
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:51,560
Well, I think why they're giving Left 4 Dead 2 out is because, you know, when you get banned

1682
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:56,360
from a game like Modern Warfare 2, you know, the only compensation you can get is to go

1683
01:15:56,360 --> 01:15:59,320
around kiddling a bunch of zombies is compensation, you know?

1684
01:15:59,320 --> 01:16:01,000
It's a fair trade.

1685
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,760
Well also, playing a big hairy biker.

1686
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:04,760
Exactly.

1687
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:09,560
Besides the also obvious part that it's also their game, you know, it is Val's game.

1688
01:16:09,560 --> 01:16:11,620
It's kind of one that they can give away.

1689
01:16:11,620 --> 01:16:16,800
It actually is kind of impressive that they instead didn't go, oh, well, whoops, we'll

1690
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:22,100
give you a copy of what's what's what's cheaper Left 4 Dead 1, you know, or something magical

1691
01:16:22,100 --> 01:16:23,100
unicorn fart.

1692
01:16:23,100 --> 01:16:24,100
Yeah, exactly.

1693
01:16:24,100 --> 01:16:25,100
Magical.

1694
01:16:25,100 --> 01:16:26,100
Well, I don't think that was a valve game.

1695
01:16:26,100 --> 01:16:29,480
So you can have a free copy of Alien Swarm.

1696
01:16:29,480 --> 01:16:32,280
Yeah, Alien Swarm.

1697
01:16:32,280 --> 01:16:34,680
Oh, wait, everybody's getting that free.

1698
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:39,040
So have we talked already about the wonderfulness that is Portal 2?

1699
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:43,880
Uh, on this show we have, but did you watch all the, um, while I'm firing up release dates?

1700
01:16:43,880 --> 01:16:44,880
Tech demonstrations?

1701
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:45,880
Wow!

1702
01:16:45,880 --> 01:16:47,120
I know, right?

1703
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:49,120
I love the slippery thing.

1704
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:50,120
The what?

1705
01:16:50,120 --> 01:16:51,120
The slippery goo?

1706
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:52,120
Yes, the goo.

1707
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:53,120
I love the goo.

1708
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:54,120
And the bouncy goo?

1709
01:16:54,120 --> 01:16:55,120
I love the bouncy goo.

1710
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:56,120
That was so great.

1711
01:16:56,120 --> 01:17:00,080
I was I was very much pleased with with the entire concept of Portal.

1712
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:05,400
Um, you know, the fact that they changed the the, oh, and I died.

1713
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:06,400
Oh, well.

1714
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:07,400
Are you still playing RuneScape?

1715
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:08,400
Yes, I'm still playing RuneScape.

1716
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:09,400
I'm still playing RuneScape.

1717
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:10,400
The zombie just killed me.

1718
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:12,400
You're worse than Loki in Magic Robot Unicorn.

1719
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:13,720
He plays Magic Robot Unicorn.

1720
01:17:13,720 --> 01:17:16,560
He denies that he does it too, but he does.

1721
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:21,320
But um, but yeah, I the only, you know, grief I kind of have was the fact that they're using

1722
01:17:21,320 --> 01:17:24,720
the, they're theoretically using the same protagonist, but she looks nothing like the

1723
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:25,720
original game.

1724
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:27,280
Did they put a picture of her?

1725
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:30,700
Um, they did, but they didn't.

1726
01:17:30,700 --> 01:17:32,800
It's like, um, they had in the picture of her.

1727
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:37,120
Well, I saw the one that was in Game Informer, um, the different, uh,

1728
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:40,320
Well, you know, she's also supposed to be, the actual person is supposed to be showing

1729
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:42,920
up in, um, Half Life 3.

1730
01:17:42,920 --> 01:17:46,200
We also might've set off an LOL, Accidental False Alarm in chat.

1731
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:48,160
Uh, Thamster says, wait, is that out now?

1732
01:17:48,160 --> 01:17:49,160
No, no, no, no, it's not.

1733
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:51,160
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1734
01:17:51,160 --> 01:17:52,160
That's a 2011.

1735
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:54,000
No, no, no, no, nope.

1736
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:57,000
But there are some sexy demos on YouTube if you want to go check it out.

1737
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:00,480
Uh, let's go to release dates, travel around the world and talk about games that are going

1738
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:01,480
to be coming out.

1739
01:18:01,480 --> 01:18:02,480
Yeah.

1740
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:05,020
Portal 2 will not be on the list this week, but maybe some other stuff.

1741
01:18:05,020 --> 01:18:06,680
So I'm going to start with the US tonight.

1742
01:18:06,680 --> 01:18:09,080
We're going to shake things up a little bit because obviously Loki's not here.

1743
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:12,800
So I'm going to cover US tonight and, uh, pronounce things correctly for once.

1744
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:13,800
I hope.

1745
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:16,080
Uh, Monster Rancher DS is out this week.

1746
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:18,900
It's going to cost you 30 bucks if you want that on the DS.

1747
01:18:18,900 --> 01:18:19,900
Sing it.

1748
01:18:19,900 --> 01:18:20,900
Family Hits.

1749
01:18:20,900 --> 01:18:21,900
That's right.

1750
01:18:21,900 --> 01:18:24,360
Cause you know, you want to sing songs from Beauty and the Beast and the Little Mermaid

1751
01:18:24,360 --> 01:18:29,000
all from Disney coming out on the DS and I'm sorry, the PlayStation three and the Wii

1752
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,440
this week.

1753
01:18:30,440 --> 01:18:32,240
You know what's interesting though?

1754
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:33,720
The PS3 one is cheaper.

1755
01:18:33,720 --> 01:18:35,600
Oh, because the Wii one comes with the mic.

1756
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:36,760
I get it.

1757
01:18:36,760 --> 01:18:40,560
Uh, Gary, I know this, this is going to be the one to get you back into console games.

1758
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:41,560
You ready?

1759
01:18:41,560 --> 01:18:42,560
Dora the Explorer.

1760
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:44,560
Dora's big first adventure on the DS.

1761
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:45,560
Oh, whatever.

1762
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:46,560
30 bucks.

1763
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:47,560
Oh no.

1764
01:18:47,560 --> 01:18:48,560
I know.

1765
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:51,120
If I wanted to get another console, I'd get a PS3.

1766
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:52,120
No.

1767
01:18:52,120 --> 01:18:55,640
Junior classic books and fairy tales, $20 on the Nintendo DS.

1768
01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:59,880
This is basically you're paying for 130 bucks that are pretty much in the public domain

1769
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:03,620
or were really cheap to license, but if you want that, hey, have fun with it.

1770
01:19:03,620 --> 01:19:08,280
So, uh, uh, quite a barrage of some more wireless controllers and accessories also out this

1771
01:19:08,280 --> 01:19:09,280
week.

1772
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:12,560
And, uh, I think we might've hit on most of the games.

1773
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:13,560
Yeah.

1774
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:16,480
I think it's kind of a slow week in game release world.

1775
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:18,760
I'm trying to see if there's anything else this week.

1776
01:19:18,760 --> 01:19:20,280
Well, there's nothing in the budget.

1777
01:19:20,280 --> 01:19:22,480
They got anything good in the budget Ben?

1778
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:26,720
Uh, well, this new game on the Xbox 360 is only $30.

1779
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:27,720
It's a role playing game.

1780
01:19:27,720 --> 01:19:32,440
And for an Xbox 360 game, that's something it's a auger rest war and it's comes out on

1781
01:19:32,440 --> 01:19:39,560
the fifth record of auger rest record of auger rest war familiar, like a certain, uh, war.

1782
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:40,560
Yeah.

1783
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:41,560
Yeah.

1784
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:42,560
Could be inspired.

1785
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:46,960
I was going to tell you record of us were started off from a Japanese tabletop game.

1786
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:47,960
Yeah.

1787
01:19:47,960 --> 01:19:48,960
Yeah.

1788
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:49,960
I knew that.

1789
01:19:49,960 --> 01:19:53,680
And if I had a bootleg of the legend of Kristinia, which was supposed to be like the original

1790
01:19:53,680 --> 01:19:59,240
sequel and they showed a bunch of guys at the convention playing it, why am I not surprised?

1791
01:19:59,240 --> 01:20:00,440
That's all I have for the U S this week.

1792
01:20:00,440 --> 01:20:04,040
Well, like I said, the UK is looking pretty bare, nothing until next week.

1793
01:20:04,040 --> 01:20:05,600
So I'm going to do Japan.

1794
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:06,600
Yay.

1795
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:10,360
Sorry to take your pronunciation away from you, Rob.

1796
01:20:10,360 --> 01:20:11,360
It's really fine.

1797
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:13,840
Put all that anime pronunciation skill to the test.

1798
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:18,440
Well, um, we've got a few things that don't really particularly have a date on it, but

PlayStation two, we have J league winning 11, 2010 club championship and persona three,

1825
01:21:51,080 --> 01:21:56,400
uh, FES, which is a PlayStation, the best to re-release persona four, also PlayStation

1826
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:58,000
two, the best.

1827
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:03,280
And then Shin Sangokumusou four empires, which is also a re-release, of course, Madden NFL

1828
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:06,360
11 is also on the list, so the persona games were really good.

1829
01:22:06,360 --> 01:22:07,360
I really liked them.

1830
01:22:07,360 --> 01:22:08,360
Believe it or not.

1831
01:22:08,360 --> 01:22:11,240
We have sports fans that listen to the show who want their roster update for the year.

1832
01:22:11,240 --> 01:22:15,800
Just like DDR fans with their song, like who in Japan likes American football anyway, on

1833
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:20,280
the way we have Tetris party premium and twinkle queen.

1834
01:22:20,280 --> 01:22:23,880
Also, um, arcade shooter, twinkle queen, let me look this up.

1835
01:22:23,880 --> 01:22:26,160
I think I met a drag queen like that once.

1836
01:22:26,160 --> 01:22:27,160
Ooh.

1837
01:22:27,160 --> 01:22:28,160
It looks pretty.

1838
01:22:28,160 --> 01:22:30,120
Isn't that a game right up your alley?

1839
01:22:30,120 --> 01:22:32,120
No, I'm looking at screen captures of it.

1840
01:22:32,120 --> 01:22:33,120
Oh, it's a fighting game.

1841
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:34,680
Oh, it's an all girl fighting game.

1842
01:22:34,680 --> 01:22:35,680
Oh, sweet.

1843
01:22:35,680 --> 01:22:36,680
Oh, wow.

1844
01:22:36,680 --> 01:22:37,680
You have my attention.

1845
01:22:37,680 --> 01:22:40,720
Sort of like the OSCO 120% back in the day.

1846
01:22:40,720 --> 01:22:41,760
Been there, done that.

1847
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:44,800
How many all chick fighting games have we seen at this point?

1848
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:48,560
Anyway, they are not going to sleep with you when you beat the game, just so you know.

1849
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:53,360
A few, um, um, you know, undated things that I just think is funny is gun blade, New York

1850
01:22:53,360 --> 01:22:56,600
and LA machine guns arcade pack, which I would totally get.

1851
01:22:56,600 --> 01:22:57,600
Love you.

1852
01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:03,800
Sega, um, colds, gym, dance, workout, and I know, right.

1853
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:07,520
And Lucha Libre, triple a heroes, Dell ring.

1854
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:14,120
And um, that was the one they were plugging at, uh, E3 and Disney guilty party.

1855
01:23:14,120 --> 01:23:17,640
I know what game that is, but that's just a funny way of phrasing it.

1856
01:23:17,640 --> 01:23:19,360
That Disney guilty party.

1857
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:23,920
Who's guilty of stealing the cookies that like clue and it kind of is like a who done

1858
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:24,920
a game.

1859
01:23:24,920 --> 01:23:25,920
There were so many characters.

1860
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:28,200
The only thing, uh, it's like an original Disney game.

1861
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:31,560
It's not like Ariel and beauty of the beast and stuff.

1862
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:35,360
The only Disney game that I'm actually looking forward to that they were, um, that they were

1863
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:39,160
plugging in E3 really, really bad was Epic Mickey.

1864
01:23:39,160 --> 01:23:40,160
That looks amazing.

1865
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:45,720
Epic Mickey does look Epic, but I got to give a shout out to Tron because I don't stand

1866
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:51,160
for movies very often, but I will be there day one Tron 3D and I'm going to have the

1867
01:23:51,160 --> 01:23:53,320
biggest fanboy boner in the galaxy.

1868
01:23:53,320 --> 01:23:54,320
Oh yeah.

1869
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:55,320
Gamers unite!

1870
01:23:55,320 --> 01:23:59,640
We'll have to just have a party of it, then you know they're going to sell so many tie

1871
01:23:59,640 --> 01:24:00,640
in games with that.

1872
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:01,640
It's going to be ridiculous.

1873
01:24:01,640 --> 01:24:02,640
If it's a good movie.

1874
01:24:02,640 --> 01:24:05,640
I had a light second game on my phone.

1875
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:06,640
Yeah.

1876
01:24:06,640 --> 01:24:11,900
Anyway, back to the Japanese list, um, PlayStation 3, Assassin's Creed II special edition and

1877
01:24:11,900 --> 01:24:15,840
Tiger Woods PGA Tour 11, why?

1878
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:20,760
And then finally for Xbox 360 we have Assassin's Creed II special edition platinum collection.

1879
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:25,200
Magna Carta 2, which I know is pretty big, and it's a platinum collection, and that would

1880
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:26,200
be all.

1881
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:27,200
That's everything.

1882
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:29,840
A lot of those were budget-binned games or re-releases, which I really like.

1883
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:31,240
Yeah, Magna Carta 2 is a re-release.

1884
01:24:31,240 --> 01:24:34,740
Yeah, Japan seems to be doing a lot of price reductions this time of year.

1885
01:24:34,740 --> 01:24:37,880
Don't know what the occasion is, but hey, I'll take any excuse.

1886
01:24:37,880 --> 01:24:39,280
Yeah, so will I.

1887
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:43,600
Yeah, somebody's got some serious rage against Mickey on the chat room.

1888
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:45,360
That would actually be Drunami.

1889
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:49,560
Some folks in our chat room are asking, uh, where is, where was it here, I'm going back

1890
01:24:49,560 --> 01:24:53,400
to our chat room, chat.orangelaungeradio.com, and I think the whole twinkle queen brought

1891
01:24:53,400 --> 01:24:54,400
this up.

1892
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:57,480
Frisbee's asking, where the fuck is the RuPaul's Drag Race game?

1893
01:24:57,480 --> 01:25:02,320
I think we talked about that on a previous edition of OLR.

1894
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:06,960
Frisbee is saying, or RuPaul's Mario Kart slash Diddy Kong Racing, I really do want

1895
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:09,320
RuPaul to have a video game of some sort.

1896
01:25:09,320 --> 01:25:13,340
Like if Project Runway can have a freaking game, or what, The Bachelor had a game come

1897
01:25:13,340 --> 01:25:17,040
out last week or this week or something, I mean, come on.

1898
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:18,640
This bitch needs a game.

1899
01:25:18,640 --> 01:25:19,640
Exactly.

1900
01:25:19,640 --> 01:25:20,640
Come on.

1901
01:25:20,640 --> 01:25:21,640
Exactly.

1902
01:25:21,640 --> 01:25:25,100
Who would, I mean, come on chat room, which would you rather play?

1903
01:25:25,100 --> 01:25:29,480
The Bachelor or RuPaul's Drag Race?

1904
01:25:29,480 --> 01:25:35,680
Even, look, even you guys who have no interest in drag whatsoever, completely secure your

1905
01:25:35,680 --> 01:25:40,120
masculinity and your love of women, I think you would play RuPaul's Drag Race versus The

1906
01:25:40,120 --> 01:25:41,120
Bachelor.

1907
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:42,120
Absolutely.

1908
01:25:42,120 --> 01:25:43,120
And why do you say this?

1909
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:44,120
Because it's awesome.

1910
01:25:44,120 --> 01:25:46,560
Because The Bachelor is gayer than RuPaul's Drag Race.

1911
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:47,560
It really is.

1912
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:48,560
I won't argue with that.

1913
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:49,560
You know what?

1914
01:25:49,560 --> 01:25:50,560
Okay.

1915
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:51,560
This is my thing.

1916
01:25:51,560 --> 01:25:57,960
Is it when I saw, when I see my husband spend hours customizing wrestling characters, like

1917
01:25:57,960 --> 01:25:58,960
they're dressed up dolls.

1918
01:25:58,960 --> 01:25:59,960
It's Barbie.

1919
01:25:59,960 --> 01:26:00,960
Yeah.

1920
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:01,960
It's Barbie for men.

1921
01:26:01,960 --> 01:26:02,960
I was like, yeah, men really like to do this too.

1922
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:05,560
Well, wrestling is just soap opera for men.

1923
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:06,920
There's nothing wrong with that.

1924
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:07,920
Men need their stories.

1925
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:08,920
Very bad soap opera.

1926
01:26:08,920 --> 01:26:11,080
I loved it.

1927
01:26:11,080 --> 01:26:16,820
And speaking of the whole rage quitting thing for Halo, I just rage created RuneScape because

1928
01:26:16,820 --> 01:26:17,820
I was sick of dying.

1929
01:26:17,820 --> 01:26:18,820
I died twice.

1930
01:26:18,820 --> 01:26:21,840
You need to get banished to a rage quit island.

1931
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:25,960
Oh, actually, don't get me started on the fact that, you know, I started the game day

1932
01:26:25,960 --> 01:26:32,220
one in RuneScape, you know, had to fend for myself, had to learn how to use all my skills

1933
01:26:32,220 --> 01:26:36,680
on my own, then about, you know, two years after I started playing, they introduced New

1934
01:26:36,680 --> 01:26:37,680
Byland.

1935
01:26:37,680 --> 01:26:38,680
Oi!

1936
01:26:38,680 --> 01:26:39,680
New Byland.

1937
01:26:39,680 --> 01:26:40,680
They basically show you-

1938
01:26:40,680 --> 01:26:42,280
There really is a place called New Byland.

1939
01:26:42,280 --> 01:26:43,280
Yeah.

1940
01:26:43,280 --> 01:26:46,560
They basically show you how to get to fifth level.

1941
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:50,480
They walk you through it tutorial style on how to crab-

1942
01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:52,200
The little hand come out of the monitor.

1943
01:26:52,200 --> 01:26:53,200
Exactly.

1944
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:54,200
Come with me.

1945
01:26:54,200 --> 01:26:56,720
It's like that stupid Milo thing they were showing at E3 last year.

1946
01:26:56,720 --> 01:26:57,720
Like come with me.

1947
01:26:57,720 --> 01:26:58,720
Yeah.

1948
01:26:58,720 --> 01:27:00,800
They were probably gonna listen to many of those people.

1949
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:03,920
It reminded me of that annoying paperclip guy on Word.

1950
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:04,920
Oh, God.

1951
01:27:04,920 --> 01:27:06,360
Let me turn the thing off.

1952
01:27:06,360 --> 01:27:08,580
I just caught a pepper in my wound.

1953
01:27:08,580 --> 01:27:13,600
Every work computer I ever log into for the first time, I'm always like, okay, first thing's

1954
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:14,600
first.

1955
01:27:14,600 --> 01:27:15,600
Launch Word.

1956
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:16,600
Kill that office assistant.

1957
01:27:16,600 --> 01:27:17,600
Right click, disable.

1958
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:18,600
Kill the paperclip.

1959
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:19,600
Euthanize the paperclip.

1960
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:21,500
Or the wizard or whatever form it happens to take.

1961
01:27:21,500 --> 01:27:23,500
That thing is so bloody annoying.

1962
01:27:23,500 --> 01:27:28,640
Do you know how many people I've seen in my professional career that like to have Mr.

1963
01:27:28,640 --> 01:27:32,800
Paperclip up all day long, but they don't like, you know how in Word you can actually

1964
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:33,800
change it.

1965
01:27:33,800 --> 01:27:34,800
So you can change it.

1966
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:35,800
Clippy.

1967
01:27:35,800 --> 01:27:36,800
That's what it's name was.

1968
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:37,800
You have Clippy, but you also have the little kitty.

1969
01:27:37,800 --> 01:27:38,800
Yeah.

1970
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:42,440
And I can't tell you how many I've seen that just like to leave the cat up on their desk

1971
01:27:42,440 --> 01:27:48,320
all day, like a little virtual Tamagotchi kitty pet running around their desktop.

1972
01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:54,460
And I'm like, but hey, look, I'm all about whatever makes you happy, but at the same

1973
01:27:54,460 --> 01:27:58,400
time don't complain about your system being slow when you have Miss Kitty running around

1974
01:27:58,400 --> 01:27:59,400
chasing yarn.

1975
01:27:59,400 --> 01:28:00,400
Yep.

1976
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:01,400
Yep.

1977
01:28:01,400 --> 01:28:02,400
Yes.

1978
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:03,400
Clippy must die.

1979
01:28:03,400 --> 01:28:04,400
My word for the whole thing is why?

1980
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:05,400
Because not a question.

1981
01:28:05,400 --> 01:28:06,400
Because they need their hands held.

1982
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:07,400
Not a question.

1983
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:08,400
Just why.

1984
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:09,400
Hold on.

1985
01:28:09,400 --> 01:28:11,640
Dark Tetsuya is making the project journey game for OLR, right?

1986
01:28:11,640 --> 01:28:15,320
Can we have a level where like Dark Sakura shoots paperclips?

1987
01:28:15,320 --> 01:28:17,880
I think that would be appropriate.

1988
01:28:17,880 --> 01:28:19,240
She can euthanize Mr. Paperclip.

1989
01:28:19,240 --> 01:28:20,860
That would be great.

1990
01:28:20,860 --> 01:28:21,860
Just making that request.

1991
01:28:21,860 --> 01:28:22,860
That's not gory enough.

1992
01:28:22,860 --> 01:28:23,860
That guy needs to die horribly.

1993
01:28:23,860 --> 01:28:27,880
Well, then a paperclip can just attack her hand if she loses.

1994
01:28:27,880 --> 01:28:32,800
Rob, the giant paperclip, but when you shoot him, he leads kittens.

1995
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:38,600
I was thinking just Mr. Paperclip could melt into slag slowly and painfully, but okay,

1996
01:28:38,600 --> 01:28:39,600
fine.

1997
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:40,600
Okay.

1998
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:42,320
Well, Rob, can I do a story?

1999
01:28:42,320 --> 01:28:43,320
Yes, you may.

2000
01:28:43,320 --> 01:28:44,320
Okay.

2001
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:45,320
Guess what?

2002
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:46,320
What?

2003
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:48,680
Disney acquired Playdom.

2004
01:28:48,680 --> 01:28:49,680
What does that mean?

2005
01:28:49,680 --> 01:28:52,360
Well, Playdom does sorority life, Rob.

2006
01:28:52,360 --> 01:28:54,480
My favorite Facebook game.

2007
01:28:54,480 --> 01:28:56,640
I so quit that really fast.

2008
01:28:56,640 --> 01:28:57,640
What?

2009
01:28:57,640 --> 01:29:03,160
I played, I seriously played sorority life religiously for like a month and then I got,

2010
01:29:03,160 --> 01:29:04,160
don't judge me.

2011
01:29:04,160 --> 01:29:06,520
I see you judging him.

2012
01:29:06,520 --> 01:29:08,680
You totally were just judging me right there.

2013
01:29:08,680 --> 01:29:09,680
Did you see that look?

2014
01:29:09,680 --> 01:29:10,680
That was the look of judgment.

2015
01:29:10,680 --> 01:29:11,680
He was judging.

2016
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:12,680
Chips.

2017
01:29:12,680 --> 01:29:13,680
That's right.

2018
01:29:13,680 --> 01:29:14,680
Oh.

2019
01:29:14,680 --> 01:29:16,760
I need to grab the chips because this is just entertaining now.

2020
01:29:16,760 --> 01:29:20,400
I was playing, look, but do you know why I was playing sorority life?

2021
01:29:20,400 --> 01:29:25,680
Because there was a dress up character mode and I was the fiercest diva on the block.

2022
01:29:25,680 --> 01:29:26,680
I was.

2023
01:29:26,680 --> 01:29:27,680
I got nothing.

2024
01:29:27,680 --> 01:29:28,680
I got nothing.

2025
01:29:28,680 --> 01:29:32,560
And uh, she would, she would beat bitches down with her purse cause that's just sorority

2026
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:33,560
life.

2027
01:29:33,560 --> 01:29:35,920
But here's what started frustrating me about sorority life.

2028
01:29:35,920 --> 01:29:40,200
They implemented, and I cannot believe we are giving this any FaceTime on the show,

2029
01:29:40,200 --> 01:29:43,080
but I really want to reiterate this week.

2030
01:29:43,080 --> 01:29:44,080
I don't give a fuck.

2031
01:29:44,080 --> 01:29:45,080
All right.

2032
01:29:45,080 --> 01:29:46,080
All right.

2033
01:29:46,080 --> 01:29:48,000
So anyway, so sorority life.

2034
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,160
Whatever floats your boat, man.

2035
01:29:50,160 --> 01:29:51,160
Whatever sinks your battleship.

2036
01:29:51,160 --> 01:29:53,040
Yes, that too.

2037
01:29:53,040 --> 01:29:54,040
Sorority life.

2038
01:29:54,040 --> 01:29:58,520
I, I played it for like a month and uh, I quit finally because I got really irritated

2039
01:29:58,520 --> 01:30:03,760
that whenever you log in, for some reason it would instantly put you up to the top of

2040
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:07,120
other people's list of who wants to beat down this bitch.

2041
01:30:07,120 --> 01:30:10,680
And so like I would log in and within three seconds I would be out of energy because I

2042
01:30:10,680 --> 01:30:14,800
would basically get gang raped by all these blonde bitches the minute I log in.

2043
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:19,540
So sorority life needed to give me at least like two minutes to bank my money or something,

2044
01:30:19,540 --> 01:30:20,540
but I didn't do that.

2045
01:30:20,540 --> 01:30:23,600
And that's my complaint with sorority life and I've totally wasted two minutes of your

2046
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:24,600
life.

2047
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:25,600
You're never going to get back.

2048
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:27,280
Can I, can I keep going?

2049
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:28,280
Yes.

2050
01:30:28,280 --> 01:30:32,840
Well play them also uses, um, social city also has, sorry, social city and market street.

2051
01:30:32,840 --> 01:30:38,600
You know, those are their other kind of big ones, but um, but Disney, Disney acquired

2052
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:39,600
them.

2053
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:45,600
It, it now has sorority life, so maybe we'll get, you know, princess sorority life.

2054
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:46,840
Now that would bring me back.

2055
01:30:46,840 --> 01:30:47,840
I would play that.

2056
01:30:47,840 --> 01:30:48,840
Okay.

2057
01:30:48,840 --> 01:30:49,840
Just real quick.

2058
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:51,800
I would like to see Belle give everyone the smack down.

2059
01:30:51,800 --> 01:30:53,640
She's the brainy woman.

2060
01:30:53,640 --> 01:30:58,280
Tiana being the new girl on the block is not old and aged like Belle, so she will beat

2061
01:30:58,280 --> 01:30:59,280
you all down.

2062
01:30:59,280 --> 01:31:01,000
There's Jasmine who probably has her whole.

2063
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:02,360
Jasmine will just whine.

2064
01:31:02,360 --> 01:31:06,960
She'll just, you know, sic her tiger on people.

2065
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:08,200
I want to have a tiger.

2066
01:31:08,200 --> 01:31:11,400
I want to be a princess with a tiger, Rob, not with a frog.

2067
01:31:11,400 --> 01:31:13,600
I thought you wanted a princess with a pony.

2068
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:17,400
No tiger or a goat.

2069
01:31:17,400 --> 01:31:18,400
Wow.

2070
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:25,280
Yeah, I'm, I'm officially decreeing the, the wah wah sound to SSJ Matt for a Facebook game,

2071
01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:26,720
getting FaceTime on the show.

2072
01:31:26,720 --> 01:31:27,720
Who would have thunk it?

2073
01:31:27,720 --> 01:31:28,720
Yeah.

2074
01:31:28,720 --> 01:31:29,720
He gets the wah wah sound.

2075
01:31:29,720 --> 01:31:30,720
I see what you did there.

2076
01:31:30,720 --> 01:31:33,280
I've, I've, um, I've bitched about how much I hate Farmville.

2077
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:34,280
Oh God.

2078
01:31:34,280 --> 01:31:36,720
Don't get me started.

2079
01:31:36,720 --> 01:31:40,200
I'm playing hotel city and I actually like it.

2080
01:31:40,200 --> 01:31:42,720
You say that like it's supposed to make it better.

2081
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:43,720
Like it's okay.

2082
01:31:43,720 --> 01:31:44,720
All right.

2083
01:31:44,720 --> 01:31:45,720
Anyhow.

2084
01:31:45,720 --> 01:31:48,160
Uh, hey, now how about a real game?

2085
01:31:48,160 --> 01:31:49,160
I like this.

2086
01:31:49,160 --> 01:31:50,160
This is awesome.

2087
01:31:50,160 --> 01:31:55,680
This game is called, there's an old school game, pengo K pengo was, let me see if I can

2088
01:31:55,680 --> 01:31:58,840
find some music from pengo cause pink pengo was pretty Epic.

2089
01:31:58,840 --> 01:32:03,200
Uh, back in the day it was this game where you would play a penguin and you walked around,

2090
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:09,040
um, a maze and you could push ice blocks freaking hard too, but it's a lot of fun.

2091
01:32:09,040 --> 01:32:11,640
I don't, I don't remember what it's inspired by, but let's see.

2092
01:32:11,640 --> 01:32:18,080
Here's a, here's some of pengo.

2093
01:32:18,080 --> 01:32:26,520
So yeah, then you push these little ice blocks around and smoosh the guys in the stage.

2094
01:32:26,520 --> 01:32:27,520
It's a lot of fun.

2095
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:28,520
It's cute.

2096
01:32:28,520 --> 01:32:31,920
It looks like pac man with a penguin and there's no dots either.

2097
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:34,000
What are those green things trying to chase you?

2098
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:35,440
The green things are, I guess trying to eat you.

2099
01:32:35,440 --> 01:32:36,440
I don't know.

2100
01:32:36,440 --> 01:32:37,440
Okay.

2101
01:32:37,440 --> 01:32:38,440
We recognize the music too.

2102
01:32:38,440 --> 01:32:39,440
Yeah.

2103
01:32:39,440 --> 01:32:40,440
That became later on.

2104
01:32:40,440 --> 01:32:42,000
I know I've heard it before.

2105
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:43,080
What game was it in?

2106
01:32:43,080 --> 01:32:44,080
What other game was in?

2107
01:32:44,080 --> 01:32:45,080
DDR.

2108
01:32:45,080 --> 01:32:46,080
Oh, raver's choice.

2109
01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:47,080
Oh wow.

2110
01:32:47,080 --> 01:32:48,080
Well there anyway.

2111
01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:49,080
That's not the point.

2112
01:32:49,080 --> 01:32:53,080
The point is it's coming out on the PSP.

2113
01:32:53,080 --> 01:32:54,080
Yay.

2114
01:32:54,080 --> 01:32:58,080
Um, no, wait, no, I take that back.

2115
01:32:58,080 --> 01:33:01,560
It's actually, I'm sorry, no, this is something completely different.

2116
01:33:01,560 --> 01:33:02,560
I'm sorry.

2117
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:03,760
It looked like a PSP screenshot at first.

2118
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:05,440
It's actually an arcade game.

2119
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:09,300
Uh, it's coming out in, uh, arcades in Japan.

2120
01:33:09,300 --> 01:33:13,600
It's going to be an eight player version, eight player, simultaneous penguins running

2121
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:14,600
around the screen.

2122
01:33:14,600 --> 01:33:15,600
Yay.

2123
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:18,440
It's not a graphical upgrade at all.

2124
01:33:18,440 --> 01:33:19,440
It's still, it's old school.

2125
01:33:19,440 --> 01:33:21,000
Hey, it's all about the gameplay.

2126
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:22,880
So there you go.

2127
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:23,880
That's really it.

2128
01:33:23,880 --> 01:33:24,880
That's all there is to say.

2129
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:26,500
It's getting a new eight player version.

2130
01:33:26,500 --> 01:33:30,960
It's an upgrade there and uh, yeah, I'm, I'm all about checking that out when that comes

2131
01:33:30,960 --> 01:33:31,960
out.

2132
01:33:31,960 --> 01:33:32,960
That's going to be cute.

2133
01:33:32,960 --> 01:33:35,320
Uh, there's, they've really only teased it with one screenshot.

2134
01:33:35,320 --> 01:33:36,840
They really haven't said a lot else.

2135
01:33:36,840 --> 01:33:41,440
Uh, but apparently more information will come out on club Sega on August 6th.

2136
01:33:41,440 --> 01:33:43,440
That'd be pretty cool.

2137
01:33:43,440 --> 01:33:44,440
Yay.

2138
01:33:44,440 --> 01:33:45,440
Woo.

2139
01:33:45,440 --> 01:33:46,440
No, no, no.

2140
01:33:46,440 --> 01:33:47,440
That's speaking of classic games.

2141
01:33:47,440 --> 01:33:50,600
Speaking of Sega, I need to enlist the aid of the chat room because I used to know the

2142
01:33:50,600 --> 01:33:53,240
name of this game and for the life of me, I forgot about it.

2143
01:33:53,240 --> 01:33:58,120
Um, it's a Sega Saturn game that was visual, not visual.

2144
01:33:58,120 --> 01:34:00,720
It was audio only and you grew seeds with it.

2145
01:34:00,720 --> 01:34:04,480
A K the game came with a packet of seeds.

2146
01:34:04,480 --> 01:34:06,920
I've only seen it once in my life and I do not remember the name of it.

2147
01:34:06,920 --> 01:34:09,360
So if anyone can find the name of the game for me, please do.

2148
01:34:09,360 --> 01:34:10,360
So what?

2149
01:34:10,360 --> 01:34:14,400
It was like music to grow seeds by you'd have to, you would control the sound output from

2150
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:15,640
it or something.

2151
01:34:15,640 --> 01:34:16,720
It was one of those bizarre games.

2152
01:34:16,720 --> 01:34:19,680
This guy's noted for super bizarre games.

2153
01:34:19,680 --> 01:34:22,120
Anyway, okay, continue Rob.

2154
01:34:22,120 --> 01:34:25,760
Okay, we're going to get into the classic game of the week as if that wasn't obscure

2155
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:26,920
enough for you.

2156
01:34:26,920 --> 01:34:29,120
Now's the part of the show.

2157
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:34,520
Dark Soccer likes to dig through the gaming vault and find a game that she says, hey,

2158
01:34:34,520 --> 01:34:39,560
you little children, babies of the world, including the new one born tonight.

2159
01:34:39,560 --> 01:34:44,320
Listen, babies, you should be, uh, schooled on these old games.

2160
01:34:44,320 --> 01:34:47,640
When I was your age, I played these games, right?

2161
01:34:47,640 --> 01:34:48,640
Dark Sakura.

2162
01:34:48,640 --> 01:34:49,640
Right.

2163
01:34:49,640 --> 01:34:50,640
You weren't really a baby.

2164
01:34:50,640 --> 01:34:54,920
You were probably like 15 when this particular game came out, but Hey, how old were you?

2165
01:34:54,920 --> 01:34:57,000
Um, I would have been, um, 20.

2166
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:58,000
Oh wow.

2167
01:34:58,000 --> 01:34:59,000
No, no, I take that back.

2168
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:00,000
I would have been 19.

2169
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:01,000
All right.

2170
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,160
Well enough talk about what you age you would have been.

2171
01:35:03,160 --> 01:35:04,320
Let's talk about what the game is.

2172
01:35:04,320 --> 01:35:06,320
What games did you pick for the folks tonight?

2173
01:35:06,320 --> 01:35:09,040
Guardian heroes.

2174
01:35:09,040 --> 01:35:10,040
Guardian heroes.

2175
01:35:10,040 --> 01:35:14,840
Um, if you will play the music, please, that's the character select.

2176
01:35:14,840 --> 01:35:17,640
I love Saturn music.

2177
01:35:17,640 --> 01:35:25,840
Anyway, yeah, the game came out on the Sega Saturn in 1996.

2178
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:30,560
Actually it was kind of funny because this came out before it did in Japan.

2179
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:36,080
It came out January 25th in America, January 26th in Japan, which I think might've actually

2180
01:35:36,080 --> 01:35:41,820
if, if I'm doing my no, cause then I was like, I'm trying to think about, you know, across

2181
01:35:41,820 --> 01:35:46,000
time zones if that would've been right, but no, I think Japan's a day ahead of us.

2182
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:47,000
Yeah, it sounds right.

2183
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:48,000
Yeah.

2184
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:53,880
Um, anyway, um, it came out on the Sega Saturn and it was, um, kind of like what Golden Axe

2185
01:35:53,880 --> 01:36:02,340
was, um, sort of 2d side scrolling, beat them up, kind of punching things, you know, using

2186
01:36:02,340 --> 01:36:04,320
magic and swords and stuff.

2187
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:08,800
Um, there was a sequel that came out in 2004 for the Game Boy Advance that was advanced

2188
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:17,080
guardian heroes, but it's sort of a, an RPG touch to the beat them up, the genre.

2189
01:36:17,080 --> 01:36:19,800
As you can, those of us in here can tell on Bob's computer.

2190
01:36:19,800 --> 01:36:20,800
Oh, I like it.

2191
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:21,800
I very much like it.

2192
01:36:21,800 --> 01:36:26,840
It's kind of got the, the, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles feel, you know, street fighter

2193
01:36:26,840 --> 01:36:27,840
2.

2194
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:28,840
No, it's not a fighting game.

2195
01:36:28,840 --> 01:36:34,480
It's, it's a beat them up, sort of like how, uh, um, Final Fight and you know, Double Dragon.

2196
01:36:34,480 --> 01:36:40,320
Except this one has magic and swords, magic and swords, but there's no blood.

2197
01:36:40,320 --> 01:36:47,160
Anyway, um, going forward, um, it had a versus mode for you to pick up to six different characters

2198
01:36:47,160 --> 01:36:48,720
and compete with the main characters.

2199
01:36:48,720 --> 01:36:55,160
You get unlockable monsters, bosses, and civilians with the time to battle or to death.

2200
01:36:55,160 --> 01:37:00,240
You get experience points through each scene and you can customize your characters with,

2201
01:37:00,240 --> 01:37:01,720
um, six different attributes.

2202
01:37:01,720 --> 01:37:07,920
You have strength, vitality, intelligence, mentality, agility, and luck.

2203
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:13,840
Um, it's actually luck is good for, um, the spell casters.

2204
01:37:13,840 --> 01:37:17,240
Anyway, um, there is of course the story mode.

2205
01:37:17,240 --> 01:37:20,440
Um, you can actually take different paths along the story.

2206
01:37:20,440 --> 01:37:24,080
So you've got different endings, different bosses, different levels.

2207
01:37:24,080 --> 01:37:28,000
You can, I mean basically it has a ton of replayability just because you can really

2208
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:29,000
keep going.

2209
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:32,040
In fact, this is one thing, and this is one thing that I know my husband loves about this,

2210
01:37:32,040 --> 01:37:37,720
is that, um, there's a path that will lead to gold and silver from Gunstar Heroes.

2211
01:37:37,720 --> 01:37:38,720
So that's pretty cool.

2212
01:37:38,720 --> 01:37:41,480
And keep in mind, this was put up by Treasure.

2213
01:37:41,480 --> 01:37:45,440
So it gets the, oh my God, Treasure Award too.

2214
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:54,480
Um, and, uh, of course the gold and silver, um, as the final boss uses the, the gem power

2215
01:37:54,480 --> 01:37:56,480
like you did in Gunstar Heroes.

2216
01:37:56,480 --> 01:38:03,360
Um, you really can, um, it has multiple levels in the game.

2217
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:07,080
You usually only have three planes of battle, the four, the mid, and the back.

2218
01:38:07,080 --> 01:38:09,920
Um, and you can switch them out in sequence.

2219
01:38:09,920 --> 01:38:15,360
Um, and there's also the shoulder buttons will make you move back and forth.

2220
01:38:15,360 --> 01:38:23,040
You also have eva- evasive moves, and, um, you also have, uh, um, like if you get surrounded

2221
01:38:23,040 --> 01:38:24,840
you can change your planes.

2222
01:38:24,840 --> 01:38:27,440
You can move to a foreground or background and whatnot.

2223
01:38:27,440 --> 01:38:29,280
So that's pretty cool.

2224
01:38:29,280 --> 01:38:36,160
Um, with the games you have Samuel Hahn, um, who is, uh, just a physical powerhouse type

2225
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:37,160
of guy.

2226
01:38:37,160 --> 01:38:43,960
You have Randy M. Green, who, um, has some spells, uh, they're elemental magic.

2227
01:38:43,960 --> 01:38:49,360
Um, Jinjiro Ibushi, who is, um, more moving attacks.

2228
01:38:49,360 --> 01:38:53,040
Uh, Nicole Neal, who has different magic.

2229
01:38:53,040 --> 01:38:57,280
And Serena Corsair, who's supposed to be, um, just a knight.

2230
01:38:57,280 --> 01:38:58,280
Pretty, pretty well-rounded.

2231
01:38:58,280 --> 01:39:07,120
Um, so yeah, it's, it's the big game, it's, uh, a real- and also good luck freaking finding

2232
01:39:07,120 --> 01:39:08,120
it.

2233
01:39:08,120 --> 01:39:10,420
Now, in Japan it was common as derp.

2234
01:39:10,420 --> 01:39:12,040
I mean, super common.

2235
01:39:12,040 --> 01:39:18,880
In the U.S., not so much because, um, they really didn't release very many copies over

2236
01:39:18,880 --> 01:39:23,120
here and of course we didn't, um, you know, they, they released plenty of, uh, advanced

2237
01:39:23,120 --> 01:39:24,120
Guardian Heroes.

2238
01:39:24,120 --> 01:39:29,280
But the Saturn one in the U.S., pretty hard to find and it's got really crappy Americanized

2239
01:39:29,280 --> 01:39:31,280
artwork on the cover.

2240
01:39:31,280 --> 01:39:36,280
Makes me kinda sick, but apart from that, though, I mean, it's a pretty, pretty damn

2241
01:39:36,280 --> 01:39:37,280
good game.

2242
01:39:37,280 --> 01:39:38,280
Alright.

2243
01:39:38,280 --> 01:39:39,500
I'll leave the cover in the chatroom.

2244
01:39:39,500 --> 01:39:43,840
There it is, folks, for the Sega Saturn, your classic game of the week, Guardian Heroes.

2245
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:46,960
Kind of a neat little, uh, combination there.

2246
01:39:46,960 --> 01:39:48,520
I like it when genres collide.

2247
01:39:48,520 --> 01:39:52,540
Well, and, and on top of that, it's treasure.

2248
01:39:52,540 --> 01:39:55,640
Is there a treasure game you haven't done at this point as a classic game of the week?

2249
01:39:55,640 --> 01:39:58,760
Well, I haven't done, like, Chameleon Twist or, um...

2250
01:39:58,760 --> 01:40:01,320
So that you, you guys can guess what'll be done for the...

2251
01:40:01,320 --> 01:40:03,200
I have, well, no, I might have to eventually do that.

2252
01:40:03,200 --> 01:40:05,200
Have I done, um, Silhouette Mirage?

2253
01:40:05,200 --> 01:40:06,840
I think I have done Silhouette Mirage.

2254
01:40:06,840 --> 01:40:07,840
You have to check the wiki.

2255
01:40:07,840 --> 01:40:08,840
I can't remember.

2256
01:40:08,840 --> 01:40:09,840
I have to look.

2257
01:40:09,840 --> 01:40:12,840
I mean, over, over 125 classic games of the week at this point.

2258
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:13,840
Crazy.

2259
01:40:13,840 --> 01:40:14,840
Alright.

2260
01:40:14,840 --> 01:40:17,520
Anyhow, uh, we're gonna go ahead and take a break, but we'll be back.

2261
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:18,520
I have done it.

2262
01:40:18,520 --> 01:40:20,520
There is plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio to come.

2263
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:23,000
We're gonna talk about Microsoft Kinect in the next segment.

2264
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:26,880
We're gonna talk about Silent Hill and a new comic book, apparently, coming out.

2265
01:40:26,880 --> 01:40:29,900
And yes, believe it or not, more Facebook games.

2266
01:40:29,900 --> 01:40:31,800
We have to talk about Zynga tonight.

2267
01:40:31,800 --> 01:40:32,800
I know.

2268
01:40:32,800 --> 01:40:33,800
I know.

2269
01:40:33,800 --> 01:40:34,800
Don't tune out.

2270
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:35,800
I promise you.

2271
01:40:35,800 --> 01:40:36,800
Rob.

2272
01:40:36,800 --> 01:40:37,800
It's gonna be lol-tastic.

2273
01:40:37,800 --> 01:40:41,080
We're gonna be back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

2274
01:40:41,080 --> 01:40:42,080
Stay tuned.

2275
01:40:42,080 --> 01:40:50,800
Hello, everybody, and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

2276
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:56,280
We are taping live on this August 1st of 2010 here at Orange Lounge Radio headquarters,

2277
01:40:56,280 --> 01:40:58,220
live at allgames.com.

2278
01:40:58,220 --> 01:41:01,240
And today is actually a very special day in OLR history.

2279
01:41:01,240 --> 01:41:05,520
Loki is not here tonight because his baby boy was just born earlier this evening at

2280
01:41:05,520 --> 01:41:07,080
five, about five o'clock.

2281
01:41:07,080 --> 01:41:10,160
Joshua is the boy's name, in case you were wondering, and you didn't hear earlier in

2282
01:41:10,160 --> 01:41:12,160
the show.

2283
01:41:12,160 --> 01:41:13,300
So we won't have Loki.

2284
01:41:13,300 --> 01:41:16,080
We anticipate he'll be out about a month.

2285
01:41:16,080 --> 01:41:17,680
So I mean, I don't know.

2286
01:41:17,680 --> 01:41:20,540
Knowing him, he might try to come back next week, but hopefully he'll take some time off

2287
01:41:20,540 --> 01:41:23,460
to go be with the baby and his wife during this very awesome time.

2288
01:41:23,460 --> 01:41:25,120
So in the meantime, we have guests galore.

2289
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:28,160
So we have a couple joining us in the studio tonight, so welcome back.

2290
01:41:28,160 --> 01:41:29,680
I hope you guys are having fun so far.

2291
01:41:29,680 --> 01:41:30,680
I'm having a blast.

2292
01:41:30,680 --> 01:41:31,680
Mila and Gary are here.

2293
01:41:31,680 --> 01:41:32,680
Yay.

2294
01:41:32,680 --> 01:41:33,680
I'm having an absolute blast.

2295
01:41:33,680 --> 01:41:34,680
Awesome.

2296
01:41:34,680 --> 01:41:35,680
This is so much fun.

2297
01:41:35,680 --> 01:41:36,680
Now I know why Drew comes.

2298
01:41:36,680 --> 01:41:37,680
He comes all the way through.

2299
01:41:37,680 --> 01:41:38,680
That's the best part.

2300
01:41:38,680 --> 01:41:40,200
We haven't even gotten emails or tweets.

2301
01:41:40,200 --> 01:41:41,560
We got Twitters to get to it a little bit.

2302
01:41:41,560 --> 01:41:42,560
But wait, there's more.

2303
01:41:42,560 --> 01:41:43,560
But wait, there's more.

2304
01:41:43,560 --> 01:41:45,240
In fact, you only got about five more minutes to get Twitter topics in.

2305
01:41:45,240 --> 01:41:48,200
I have not been able to do any plugs on Twitter tonight because I've been so busy.

2306
01:41:48,200 --> 01:41:51,240
So I don't know if we're going to have anything waiting for us there, but I'll look.

2307
01:41:51,240 --> 01:41:53,360
We have spam in French.

2308
01:41:53,360 --> 01:41:55,120
We get spam in French all the time.

2309
01:41:55,120 --> 01:41:56,120
I know.

2310
01:41:56,120 --> 01:41:58,080
I was just laughing because I can read it.

2311
01:41:58,080 --> 01:41:59,960
They think the show is based out of Quebec or something.

2312
01:41:59,960 --> 01:42:00,960
I don't know.

2313
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:04,400
All right, let's get to some rapid, rapid news, some quick news that we like to go over

2314
01:42:04,400 --> 01:42:08,120
very quickly before we get to the Twitter topics tonight.

2315
01:42:08,120 --> 01:42:11,360
I'll start tonight since we don't have Loki.

2316
01:42:11,360 --> 01:42:16,720
We have some news about some Call of Duty, I guess, special edition games.

2317
01:42:16,720 --> 01:42:18,120
These are black ops.

2318
01:42:18,120 --> 01:42:23,160
There's going to be a prestige edition for 150 bucks and a hardened edition for 80 bucks.

2319
01:42:23,160 --> 01:42:25,200
I guess these are some rumors picked up.

2320
01:42:25,200 --> 01:42:29,480
It was on buy.com, but the listing was since pulled.

2321
01:42:29,480 --> 01:42:34,680
I can tell you this, though, the rumblings around and people that I know and, you know,

2322
01:42:34,680 --> 01:42:37,400
I got friends in low places and so forth.

2323
01:42:37,400 --> 01:42:39,840
Orange on Trady wants to tell you guys this is true.

2324
01:42:39,840 --> 01:42:45,000
These are happening, but I mean, also, that's kind of like telling you like rain will eventually

2325
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:46,480
fall from the sky next month.

2326
01:42:46,480 --> 01:42:49,360
Of course, there's going to be limited editions of these huge games.

2327
01:42:49,360 --> 01:42:50,720
Shouldn't be a huge surprise.

2328
01:42:50,720 --> 01:42:54,640
Activision hasn't officially announced it yet, but they will prestige for 150 bucks,

2329
01:42:54,640 --> 01:42:56,560
hardened edition for $80.

2330
01:42:56,560 --> 01:42:58,440
Couldn't tell you what's in those.

2331
01:42:58,440 --> 01:43:05,400
Although we're hearing possibly like something about maybe a little car.

2332
01:43:05,400 --> 01:43:06,400
I don't know.

2333
01:43:06,400 --> 01:43:08,480
Take that with what you will.

2334
01:43:08,480 --> 01:43:10,120
This is one that Activision will talk about.

2335
01:43:10,120 --> 01:43:14,000
It is DJ Tiesto is actually joining DJ Hero 2.

2336
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:17,400
He's actually going to be in the game as a playable character, and he's going to be doing

2337
01:43:17,400 --> 01:43:18,880
two new mixes in the game.

2338
01:43:18,880 --> 01:43:20,600
I think that's kind of rad.

2339
01:43:20,600 --> 01:43:27,800
No news yet as to exactly what he's doing, but there was a little video that was released,

2340
01:43:27,800 --> 01:43:29,760
so I'm not sure what this video shows us.

2341
01:43:29,760 --> 01:43:33,400
I think it just shows him in game, and it might be like playing one of his mixes here,

2342
01:43:33,400 --> 01:43:39,120
but they did release a little clip here from DJ Hero 2.

2343
01:43:39,120 --> 01:43:43,720
I'm trying to get a little more of it here in studio, but the first one was really awesome.

2344
01:43:43,720 --> 01:43:45,720
Oh, I love DJ Hero 1.

2345
01:43:45,720 --> 01:43:47,720
I'm a DJ.

2346
01:43:47,720 --> 01:43:52,000
Play for so many people.

2347
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:53,720
I'm very lucky that I have that opportunity.

2348
01:43:53,720 --> 01:43:54,720
Nah, I don't want to hear the whole interview.

2349
01:43:54,720 --> 01:43:55,720
I was hoping to hear more of his music.

2350
01:43:55,720 --> 01:43:58,760
He'll be part of DJ Hero Gamers.

2351
01:43:58,760 --> 01:44:01,800
Alright, he'll be in DJ Hero, hooray for him.

2352
01:44:01,800 --> 01:44:03,600
Alright, also Kmart.

2353
01:44:03,600 --> 01:44:07,560
Wow, this is like three shows in a row we've actually had a Kmart story.

2354
01:44:07,560 --> 01:44:09,200
I don't get this.

2355
01:44:09,200 --> 01:44:10,560
When did Kmart become relevant?

2356
01:44:10,560 --> 01:44:11,560
I don't understand.

2357
01:44:11,560 --> 01:44:12,560
This is so weird.

2358
01:44:12,560 --> 01:44:14,880
Well, you know they've done the whole rebranding thing, so perhaps.

2359
01:44:14,880 --> 01:44:18,800
Well, they're really trying to appeal to the gamers, and this is a pretty big one.

2360
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:20,960
This is a great way to appeal to gamers.

2361
01:44:20,960 --> 01:44:22,720
Sell stuff cheap.

2362
01:44:22,720 --> 01:44:26,360
The Wii console, down to $179.99 this week.

2363
01:44:26,360 --> 01:44:27,360
What is it?

2364
01:44:27,360 --> 01:44:32,920
A whole $20 off, but hey, that's 10% of the cost, so hard to complain about that.

2365
01:44:32,920 --> 01:44:36,920
By the way, the deal runs out tomorrow, so you better hurry up and get on that.

2366
01:44:36,920 --> 01:44:37,920
Aw, damn.

2367
01:44:37,920 --> 01:44:39,520
It just came right around the corner from my house.

2368
01:44:39,520 --> 01:44:42,720
Both the white and the black Wiis, just so you know.

2369
01:44:42,720 --> 01:44:44,440
I have no money, no.

2370
01:44:44,440 --> 01:44:46,840
Well, how about some other stuff?

2371
01:44:46,840 --> 01:44:47,840
How about it?

2372
01:44:47,840 --> 01:44:48,840
Yeah.

2373
01:44:48,840 --> 01:44:49,840
This makes me particularly happy.

2374
01:44:49,840 --> 01:44:52,840
In the rock band, we have Blondie.

2375
01:44:52,840 --> 01:44:53,840
Yay!

2376
01:44:53,840 --> 01:44:54,840
Ooh.

2377
01:44:54,840 --> 01:44:58,960
There's already a little Blondie in there, but I'm never gonna say no to more Blondie.

2378
01:44:58,960 --> 01:45:02,640
And also a group that I like, Family Force 5.

2379
01:45:02,640 --> 01:45:03,640
Money?

2380
01:45:03,640 --> 01:45:09,280
So, actually, so with this upcoming pack that's gonna be out on August 3rd, we have Rapture

2381
01:45:09,280 --> 01:45:16,520
for Blondie, Jesus Freak DC Talk, whatever, The Perfect Crime number 2, The Decemberists,

2382
01:45:16,520 --> 01:45:22,660
I Only Want You, Eagles of Death Metal, Saturday Morning Eels, Love Addict Family Force 5,

2383
01:45:22,660 --> 01:45:28,280
Sturm and Drang, KMFDM, and Bulletproof LaRue.

2384
01:45:28,280 --> 01:45:29,280
Shut up.

2385
01:45:29,280 --> 01:45:30,280
What, in rock band?

2386
01:45:30,280 --> 01:45:31,280
Mm-hmm.

2387
01:45:31,280 --> 01:45:32,280
We're getting Bulletproof?

2388
01:45:32,280 --> 01:45:33,280
Yeah.

2389
01:45:33,280 --> 01:45:34,280
I love that song.

2390
01:45:34,280 --> 01:45:35,280
Even though it's way overplayed on the radio right now.

2391
01:45:35,280 --> 01:45:36,280
Yay!

2392
01:45:36,280 --> 01:45:37,280
I loved it like nine months ago.

2393
01:45:37,280 --> 01:45:38,280
Awesome.

2394
01:45:38,280 --> 01:45:39,560
I'm getting DC Talk.

2395
01:45:39,560 --> 01:45:40,560
That's funny.

2396
01:45:40,560 --> 01:45:41,560
Oh, come on.

2397
01:45:41,560 --> 01:45:43,560
Let's give him a break.

2398
01:45:43,560 --> 01:45:52,400
ASRB has Fatal Labyrinth, which was a Sega Genesis game.

2399
01:45:52,400 --> 01:45:58,280
It's supposed to be set up on, well, it's on the PC downloads, but it's also gonna be

2400
01:45:58,280 --> 01:46:04,640
available for Wii, for the Virtual Console, and Mac, PS3, Xbox 360.

2401
01:46:04,640 --> 01:46:06,440
It's in the Genesis collection thingy.

2402
01:46:06,440 --> 01:46:07,440
Yes it is.

2403
01:46:07,440 --> 01:46:08,440
Don't bother.

2404
01:46:08,440 --> 01:46:09,440
In the Sonic Ultimate Genesis collection.

2405
01:46:09,440 --> 01:46:11,200
I mean, get the Sonic collection.

2406
01:46:11,200 --> 01:46:15,560
It's great, but don't bother with a $5 standalone release when you get that collection for $20.

2407
01:46:15,560 --> 01:46:16,560
It's great.

2408
01:46:16,560 --> 01:46:17,560
Mm-hmm.

2409
01:46:17,560 --> 01:46:18,560
And you get, like, tons of stuff right now.

2410
01:46:18,560 --> 01:46:19,880
Sometimes it is worth it to pay more.

2411
01:46:19,880 --> 01:46:21,280
And that game kind of blows.

2412
01:46:21,280 --> 01:46:25,000
I mean, I hate to say it, but it's kind of like somebody decided to port, I don't know

2413
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:28,440
if you guys know Rogue, the old-ass game from, like, years and years ago.

2414
01:46:28,440 --> 01:46:32,240
Somebody decided to port Rogue to the Sega Genesis, and that's kind of what you got.

2415
01:46:32,240 --> 01:46:33,800
And Rogue is more fun.

2416
01:46:33,800 --> 01:46:43,800
Well, um, now also in other news, there is a mandatory update for PS3 firmware 3.41.

2417
01:46:43,800 --> 01:46:50,040
So it's gonna add in a You May Like section to the PlayStation Store.

2418
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:52,040
And really, that's about it.

2419
01:46:52,040 --> 01:46:54,040
There's nothing else.

2420
01:46:54,040 --> 01:46:55,760
But it's mandatory.

2421
01:46:55,760 --> 01:46:58,720
That's like how Twitter now shows me people I ought to be following.

2422
01:46:58,720 --> 01:47:00,160
I don't give a crap.

2423
01:47:00,160 --> 01:47:01,160
Anyway.

2424
01:47:01,160 --> 01:47:06,120
I know, I'm like, a lot of these people I'm not following for a reason, just so you know.

2425
01:47:06,120 --> 01:47:11,160
All right, let's go to Twitter topics and visit the Tweeter and see who's sending us

2426
01:47:11,160 --> 01:47:13,960
messages.

2427
01:47:13,960 --> 01:47:17,040
Not a lot, because I forgot to put the call out on Twitter earlier this evening, because

2428
01:47:17,040 --> 01:47:19,160
I was kind of, you know, I had a lot going on.

2429
01:47:19,160 --> 01:47:21,240
You know, stuff and things and such as.

2430
01:47:21,240 --> 01:47:25,160
But we did, that did not stop some tweets from coming in, and we're very excited that

2431
01:47:25,160 --> 01:47:27,240
at least a handful of tweets are coming in.

2432
01:47:27,240 --> 01:47:33,280
First one from Tiger Claw, because he always will dig up a story that we somehow overlook.

2433
01:47:33,280 --> 01:47:35,800
And this is definitely one that I think is interesting, that we did overlook, and it

2434
01:47:35,800 --> 01:47:40,720
comes from the International Business Times that he's actually linking us to.

2435
01:47:40,720 --> 01:47:46,280
China is actually pushing a real name system for online games, and that starts today, August

2436
01:47:46,280 --> 01:47:47,280
1st.

2437
01:47:47,280 --> 01:47:50,020
You're gonna have to register using your real name if you want to play an online game.

2438
01:47:50,020 --> 01:47:52,360
This is like real ID gone wrong.

2439
01:47:52,360 --> 01:47:53,960
Really wrong.

2440
01:47:53,960 --> 01:47:55,300
That comes from the Ministry of Culture.

2441
01:47:55,300 --> 01:48:01,480
It was announced on June 22nd, and it's part of a nationwide campaign to improve management

2442
01:48:01,480 --> 01:48:05,760
of the virtual gaming industry and protect the minor from unwholesome content.

2443
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:08,360
Well, you do realize this is China, right?

2444
01:48:08,360 --> 01:48:10,040
Yeah, I know, it's different.

2445
01:48:10,040 --> 01:48:11,720
It's obviously a lot different than real ID.

2446
01:48:11,720 --> 01:48:18,520
Well, they have some serious issues with people not managing their time well on these MMOs,

2447
01:48:18,520 --> 01:48:19,520
right?

2448
01:48:19,520 --> 01:48:20,520
So, I don't know.

2449
01:48:20,520 --> 01:48:23,560
I mean, but then again, we have some people with issues not managing their time well in

2450
01:48:23,560 --> 01:48:27,600
America as well, so it just seems to be a lot worse.

2451
01:48:27,600 --> 01:48:29,440
Some of the stories you hear are really, really scary over there.

2452
01:48:29,440 --> 01:48:33,120
I don't know what they're talking about, Shifty Eyes, Shifty Eyes.

2453
01:48:33,120 --> 01:48:36,600
But anyhow, how would you like it if they stepped in and said, hey, everybody's gonna

2454
01:48:36,600 --> 01:48:38,320
have to play online games with their real name.

2455
01:48:38,320 --> 01:48:39,320
Do not want.

2456
01:48:39,320 --> 01:48:40,320
Do not want.

2457
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:42,320
Good luck with that, China.

2458
01:48:42,320 --> 01:48:45,760
All right, next up though, speaking of China, how about Chinatown?

2459
01:48:45,760 --> 01:48:50,000
Matt, sj100matt on Twitter actually wanted to link us to this.

2460
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,840
He kind of wanted to give a shout out to one of his local arcades.

2461
01:48:52,840 --> 01:48:57,400
I've heard of this place, but I've never been, and he was very proud that Kotaku had featured

2462
01:48:57,400 --> 01:49:01,840
it this week, because you know, they're one of the big boy gaming blogs, and so they feature

2463
01:49:01,840 --> 01:49:03,400
stuff once in a while.

2464
01:49:03,400 --> 01:49:07,000
And they are talking about the Chinatown Fair Video Arcade.

2465
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:10,680
It is located on Mott Street in New York City's Chinatown.

2466
01:49:10,680 --> 01:49:17,240
Apparently, it is also this environment that LGBT youth can just kind of be themselves.

2467
01:49:17,240 --> 01:49:18,560
Oh yeah, I read about that.

2468
01:49:18,560 --> 01:49:25,000
Kind of interesting that it's gaming and LGBT colliding, although I thought it was really

2469
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:26,600
cool when I went to that place in Portland.

2470
01:49:26,600 --> 01:49:29,640
They had like an LGBT night once a month, which I thought was kind of fun.

2471
01:49:29,640 --> 01:49:31,040
All the gay gamers can get together.

2472
01:49:31,040 --> 01:49:37,200
You know, I really feel that they need to include the asexual on that list too.

2473
01:49:37,200 --> 01:49:42,020
Well there's a big old long string of alphabet soup, but you know, at some point it gets

2474
01:49:42,020 --> 01:49:43,020
too big.

2475
01:49:43,020 --> 01:49:44,020
You know what I mean?

2476
01:49:44,020 --> 01:49:47,840
But anyway, let's see, what else do I want to say?

2477
01:49:47,840 --> 01:49:51,300
They wrote this nice little article on it that talked about, you know, that basically

2478
01:49:51,300 --> 01:49:54,780
it's a very diverse place and all the customers are very valued.

2479
01:49:54,780 --> 01:49:57,760
As they should be, that's just good customer service folks.

2480
01:49:57,760 --> 01:50:01,000
So a quote from one of the patrons of the place, we get all sorts.

2481
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:05,780
We got dudes that go to raves, we got anime nerds, otaku, we get professional players.

2482
01:50:05,780 --> 01:50:09,800
So it just sounds like this hodgepodge of just go play and have fun.

2483
01:50:09,800 --> 01:50:11,480
That's what video games should be about anyway.

2484
01:50:11,480 --> 01:50:18,360
It shouldn't even be about LGBT or raevars or otaku or whatever.

2485
01:50:18,360 --> 01:50:19,760
Just have fun.

2486
01:50:19,760 --> 01:50:20,760
Don't be a dick.

2487
01:50:20,760 --> 01:50:21,760
Yeah, exactly.

2488
01:50:21,760 --> 01:50:24,840
We got enough clicks in the real world.

2489
01:50:24,840 --> 01:50:27,600
Always remember rule one, don't be a dick.

2490
01:50:27,600 --> 01:50:28,600
Exactly.

2491
01:50:28,600 --> 01:50:29,600
Exactly.

2492
01:50:29,600 --> 01:50:30,600
Don't be a dick.

2493
01:50:30,600 --> 01:50:32,720
And don't bring your click into the virtual world.

2494
01:50:32,720 --> 01:50:37,760
And then lastly, Dark Tetsuya on the tweeters wants us to plug his latest retro review for

2495
01:50:37,760 --> 01:50:39,160
Mega Man on the site.

2496
01:50:39,160 --> 01:50:42,400
It's actually pretty awesome, so go check that out at orangeslunchradio.com.

2497
01:50:42,400 --> 01:50:47,920
Whole little, I don't want to say expose on Mega Man, but it's a nice little retrospective.

2498
01:50:47,920 --> 01:50:50,360
The original Mega Man games, I remember those very fondly.

2499
01:50:50,360 --> 01:50:51,360
They were awesome.

2500
01:50:51,360 --> 01:50:55,240
Oh man, you got to see some of the new ones, because the new ones are, they invoke the

2501
01:50:55,240 --> 01:50:56,680
old ones very well.

2502
01:50:56,680 --> 01:50:57,680
It's very cool.

2503
01:50:57,680 --> 01:50:59,040
Very, very cool.

2504
01:50:59,040 --> 01:51:01,600
All right, let's get back into some other news here.

2505
01:51:01,600 --> 01:51:03,520
I'm going to start off with a story on Kinect.

2506
01:51:03,520 --> 01:51:07,400
Kinect, of course, being the motion control device coming out from Microsoft.

2507
01:51:07,400 --> 01:51:12,920
We announced last week that it was going to be $150, although, obviously, speculation

2508
01:51:12,920 --> 01:51:16,160
had run rampant on that for a while.

2509
01:51:16,160 --> 01:51:18,160
It's coming with Kinect Adventures.

2510
01:51:18,160 --> 01:51:21,280
And of course, they got a lot of shit for that.

2511
01:51:21,280 --> 01:51:23,680
Well, I guess they came out this week.

2512
01:51:23,680 --> 01:51:26,160
It was the marketing manager, Brett Siddons.

2513
01:51:26,160 --> 01:51:29,080
He's the marketing manager for Microsoft Kinect.

2514
01:51:29,080 --> 01:51:31,080
He was at an event in the UK for Amazon.

2515
01:51:31,080 --> 01:51:34,880
He says that the Kinect is, quote, very competitively priced.

2516
01:51:34,880 --> 01:51:38,200
Now, since he was in the UK, he was talking about UK pricing.

2517
01:51:38,200 --> 01:51:39,200
But you know what?

2518
01:51:39,200 --> 01:51:41,400
It's all the same deal at the end of the day.

2519
01:51:41,400 --> 01:51:46,960
He's basically saying that the navigation controller is going to be an extra $30 on

2520
01:51:46,960 --> 01:51:49,000
top of the $100 bundle.

2521
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:53,180
At least that is the Sony, you know, way of looking at things.

2522
01:51:53,180 --> 01:51:57,640
So I think we talked a little bit about price chart last week anyway that showed everything

2523
01:51:57,640 --> 01:51:59,040
kind of all in a row there.

2524
01:51:59,040 --> 01:52:04,520
And yeah, if you want to get the whole deal for PlayStation Move, it's a little bit more

2525
01:52:04,520 --> 01:52:07,900
expensive than Kinect, especially when it's two people.

2526
01:52:07,900 --> 01:52:13,320
So anyway, Microsoft is basically trying to say, hey, if you want two people to have fun,

2527
01:52:13,320 --> 01:52:17,560
you only need one Kinect, whereas with all these other systems, you need two of everything.

2528
01:52:17,560 --> 01:52:19,240
And we kind of knew they'd go this way.

2529
01:52:19,240 --> 01:52:23,160
And I think as we talked about last week a little bit, it's kind of like, well, but your

2530
01:52:23,160 --> 01:52:28,960
console then offsets the price of a Wii and it's really all about the games at the end

2531
01:52:28,960 --> 01:52:29,960
of the day, honestly.

2532
01:52:29,960 --> 01:52:34,480
I mean, you can charge plenty for this system as long as you have the games to back it up.

2533
01:52:34,480 --> 01:52:38,840
But if Dance Central is going to be your only good game, I don't know if it's worth the

2534
01:52:38,840 --> 01:52:39,840
time.

2535
01:52:39,840 --> 01:52:46,960
Of all the E3 games that I saw for the Kinect, the one that I really would love to go over

2536
01:52:46,960 --> 01:52:54,840
to a friend's house and play because I do not own a 360, God forbid, is the Children

2537
01:52:54,840 --> 01:52:56,240
of Eden.

2538
01:52:56,240 --> 01:52:57,320
Looks amazing.

2539
01:52:57,320 --> 01:52:58,320
It does look great.

2540
01:52:58,320 --> 01:53:01,080
It's too bad they didn't have a playable one on the show floor, so we don't know enough

2541
01:53:01,080 --> 01:53:02,080
about it.

2542
01:53:02,080 --> 01:53:05,240
If you can't imagine it's going to be Rez using your body, that's cool enough for me.

2543
01:53:05,240 --> 01:53:08,160
Yeah, that just looks absolutely amazing.

2544
01:53:08,160 --> 01:53:09,160
And so.

2545
01:53:09,160 --> 01:53:10,160
It'll be great.

2546
01:53:10,160 --> 01:53:11,160
All right.

2547
01:53:11,160 --> 01:53:14,480
Dr. Sakura, what do you got for us?

2548
01:53:14,480 --> 01:53:15,480
Stuff.

2549
01:53:15,480 --> 01:53:18,520
Well, this is actually pretty cool.

2550
01:53:18,520 --> 01:53:26,680
Silent Hill 8, the guy who's writing it, Tom Waltz, is also working on a comic book crossover

2551
01:53:26,680 --> 01:53:29,280
called Silent Hill Past Life.

2552
01:53:29,280 --> 01:53:38,920
But in 1867, and it was about an outlaw called Jebediah Foster, who meets a widow that changes

2553
01:53:38,920 --> 01:53:40,560
his ways.

2554
01:53:40,560 --> 01:53:45,640
And they move to Silent Hill to escape the Wild West.

2555
01:53:45,640 --> 01:53:49,560
But of course Silent Hill screws him over.

2556
01:53:49,560 --> 01:53:55,400
But it's that the game is going to feature a character from the comic, although the game

2557
01:53:55,400 --> 01:53:58,140
is in modern times.

2558
01:53:58,140 --> 01:54:04,760
So hey, I hope that they do better trailers out there for Silent Hill 8, and I really

2559
01:54:04,760 --> 01:54:08,560
need to sit down and watch it.

2560
01:54:08,560 --> 01:54:10,240
They showed a little bit at E3.

2561
01:54:10,240 --> 01:54:12,840
It looked all right.

2562
01:54:12,840 --> 01:54:15,560
I like that you have to put in your birthday.

2563
01:54:15,560 --> 01:54:18,120
Because it's restricted content, young lady.

2564
01:54:18,120 --> 01:54:19,120
I know.

2565
01:54:19,120 --> 01:54:20,120
All right.

2566
01:54:20,120 --> 01:54:24,160
Well, while she's watching that, I have to bring this up.

2567
01:54:24,160 --> 01:54:28,680
I apologize in advance, but let's all poke a little fun at Zynga this week.

2568
01:54:28,680 --> 01:54:31,600
Because they did something where they're getting a lot of shit for it.

2569
01:54:31,600 --> 01:54:34,600
So if you don't like Zynga, you can kind of like jump on the bandwagon with this.

2570
01:54:34,600 --> 01:54:35,600
It'll be fun.

2571
01:54:35,600 --> 01:54:36,600
Okay, here's the deal.

2572
01:54:36,600 --> 01:54:37,880
Zynga has this game on Facebook.

2573
01:54:37,880 --> 01:54:39,920
It's called Street Racing.

2574
01:54:39,920 --> 01:54:44,520
And they announced, with really no rhyme or reason, that they are shutting the game down

2575
01:54:44,520 --> 01:54:47,000
tomorrow, August 2nd.

2576
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:48,640
I don't know what Street Racing is.

2577
01:54:48,640 --> 01:54:49,640
I've never played it.

2578
01:54:49,640 --> 01:54:52,400
I'm just going to guess it's Farmville with Cars.

2579
01:54:52,400 --> 01:54:53,400
Okay?

2580
01:54:53,400 --> 01:54:54,480
That's just my guess.

2581
01:54:54,480 --> 01:54:57,840
Or maybe it's like Mafia Wars, but with street cars.

2582
01:54:57,840 --> 01:54:58,960
Maybe it's like Fast and the Furious.

2583
01:54:58,960 --> 01:54:59,960
I don't know.

2584
01:54:59,960 --> 01:55:03,560
Regardless, whatever the reason, this game is being shut down tomorrow.

2585
01:55:03,560 --> 01:55:05,720
No rhyme or reason why they're doing it.

2586
01:55:05,720 --> 01:55:11,240
Now, if you know Zynga, part of the way they make money is that they try to get you to

2587
01:55:11,240 --> 01:55:15,080
buy shit in game with, you know, they pop up all these things about, you know, what

2588
01:55:15,080 --> 01:55:18,000
you can get for, you know, extra money.

2589
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:21,040
If you give them money, you can get this in game.

2590
01:55:21,040 --> 01:55:25,200
And so a lot of people are wondering, well, if I paid money for Street Racing, which,

2591
01:55:25,200 --> 01:55:29,480
believe it or not, a lot of people did, what's going to happen?

2592
01:55:29,480 --> 01:55:34,120
Well, Zynga came out this week and said, quote, as an acknowledgement of the inconvenience

2593
01:55:34,120 --> 01:55:38,800
these changes may have caused, we have offered credits to all players who have made a purchase

2594
01:55:38,800 --> 01:55:42,040
in the last 90 days.

2595
01:55:42,040 --> 01:55:44,540
All right.

2596
01:55:44,540 --> 01:55:48,400
So these players will receive a credit for the exact amounts of their purchases, plus

2597
01:55:48,400 --> 01:55:55,280
an additional hundred units of premium currency in any of Zynga's nine most popular games.

2598
01:55:55,280 --> 01:55:58,880
So in other words, if you bought stuff, they're not going to refund you.

2599
01:55:58,880 --> 01:56:03,680
They're just going to let you have credits for other games.

2600
01:56:03,680 --> 01:56:08,740
What if I don't want those other games?

2601
01:56:08,740 --> 01:56:12,280
Although we can kind of sit here and kind of point and laugh and haha at Zynga and who

2602
01:56:12,280 --> 01:56:16,960
bought that shit anyway, it does kind of lead to this scary precedent.

2603
01:56:16,960 --> 01:56:24,240
For example, right now you can buy things in World of Warcraft, right?

2604
01:56:24,240 --> 01:56:28,960
And what if in World of Warcraft you buy, I don't know, like a pet?

2605
01:56:28,960 --> 01:56:30,920
What's going to happen when World of Warcraft goes away?

2606
01:56:30,920 --> 01:56:37,400
You lose that pet, which, you know, duh, you should know that games don't last forever

2607
01:56:37,400 --> 01:56:38,400
and so forth.

2608
01:56:38,400 --> 01:56:42,840
But it should be something you think about before you get these, you know, untangible

2609
01:56:42,840 --> 01:56:43,840
items.

2610
01:56:43,840 --> 01:56:44,840
Correct?

2611
01:56:44,840 --> 01:56:47,000
So this serves as a little bit of a lesson.

2612
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:52,960
If ever this game decides to shut its doors, it's gone.

2613
01:56:52,960 --> 01:56:55,640
You know, there is a members runescape as well as a freerunscape.

2614
01:56:55,640 --> 01:56:58,920
Yes, I'm going back on a kick for about two seconds.

2615
01:56:58,920 --> 01:57:03,520
But if you run out of membership money and it boots you back into free world, you keep

2616
01:57:03,520 --> 01:57:04,980
all your stuff.

2617
01:57:04,980 --> 01:57:07,280
You just can't use anything.

2618
01:57:07,280 --> 01:57:13,220
So you keep all your members' stuff that you, you know, bought or acquired or whatever,

2619
01:57:13,220 --> 01:57:18,720
but it just stays in your bank and pretty much useless until you get more money.

2620
01:57:18,720 --> 01:57:20,760
So you don't lose it.

2621
01:57:20,760 --> 01:57:29,240
You don't lose it, which, you know, the whole thing that they're shutting it down, you know,

2622
01:57:29,240 --> 01:57:33,760
it's for no rhyme or reason, nothing.

2623
01:57:33,760 --> 01:57:36,480
They're not saying why Street Racer got shut down.

2624
01:57:36,480 --> 01:57:40,680
I'm wondering if it has to do with the fact that street racing is kind of like a, you

2625
01:57:40,680 --> 01:57:44,040
know, borderline legality type of thing, and maybe they're getting in shit because they're

2626
01:57:44,040 --> 01:57:49,360
promoting something that's, you know, kind of illegal in a way.

2627
01:57:49,360 --> 01:57:52,120
I wonder if that's, that's probably what it's about.

2628
01:57:52,120 --> 01:57:55,480
Anyhow, let's see.

2629
01:57:55,480 --> 01:57:57,760
Where are we at?

2630
01:57:57,760 --> 01:58:00,000
Comments in chatroom chat.orangelandtrady.com.

2631
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:04,520
Bonds 006 says, but Neopets, Petpet, they live, I hope.

2632
01:58:04,520 --> 01:58:07,360
Neopets is another one of those sites that might go away someday.

2633
01:58:07,360 --> 01:58:12,240
Hitstun, if ever Xbox live goes offline, you can't play any of the Xbox live indie games

2634
01:58:12,240 --> 01:58:13,240
you bought.

2635
01:58:13,240 --> 01:58:14,240
Good point.

2636
01:58:14,240 --> 01:58:17,360
I mean, original Xbox was just shut down a couple months ago.

2637
01:58:17,360 --> 01:58:21,280
Does that mean in about five years, the Xbox we have now is also going to get shut down

2638
01:58:21,280 --> 01:58:23,700
and then all these indie games go wrong?

2639
01:58:23,700 --> 01:58:26,840
It's kind of funny because a lot of people were giving crap to on live.

2640
01:58:26,840 --> 01:58:30,480
The new service that's out to let you play games like through the streaming service.

2641
01:58:30,480 --> 01:58:33,800
Like you're going to buy this game for $50, but it's really only guaranteed to work for

2642
01:58:33,800 --> 01:58:34,800
three years.

2643
01:58:34,800 --> 01:58:36,840
Then they might pull the plug on, on live.

2644
01:58:36,840 --> 01:58:41,080
Whereas if you go to the store and buy a game for $50, you pretty much have it quote unquote

2645
01:58:41,080 --> 01:58:43,520
forever.

2646
01:58:43,520 --> 01:58:44,520
Just things to think about.

2647
01:58:44,520 --> 01:58:48,360
I don't know one way or the other.

2648
01:58:48,360 --> 01:58:52,720
It's kind of almost reminds me of the old school Nintendo, how they would, you know,

2649
01:58:52,720 --> 01:58:57,480
every time a new console would come out, you can't use the old school games in the new

2650
01:58:57,480 --> 01:58:58,480
console.

2651
01:58:58,480 --> 01:59:03,040
So it's like you just, you know, plunker down 15 bucks to buy that really awesome version

2652
01:59:03,040 --> 01:59:04,040
of Zelda.

2653
01:59:04,040 --> 01:59:05,040
That won't go in your Super Nintendo.

2654
01:59:05,040 --> 01:59:06,840
Yeah, nothing was backward compatible.

2655
01:59:06,840 --> 01:59:11,560
That's why I kind of stuck to the PlayStation series so I can play my old PlayStation games

2656
01:59:11,560 --> 01:59:12,560
on the PS2.

2657
01:59:12,560 --> 01:59:15,920
I guess they're all backward compatible with the PS3 too.

2658
01:59:15,920 --> 01:59:19,740
PS1 is, but you, and this is what doesn't make sense about Sony.

2659
01:59:19,740 --> 01:59:24,480
It depends what console you got and how early you bought a PS3 if you can backwards compatible

2660
01:59:24,480 --> 01:59:25,480
or can't.

2661
01:59:25,480 --> 01:59:26,480
I think she can, but I can't.

2662
01:59:26,480 --> 01:59:30,560
I can because I got, we have a first release PS3.

2663
01:59:30,560 --> 01:59:34,620
They took out a lot of the extra bells and whistles with later releases.

2664
01:59:34,620 --> 01:59:38,160
So if I bought a PS3 now I wouldn't be able to, he probably couldn't do jack shit.

2665
01:59:38,160 --> 01:59:42,240
No sir, not unless you got really lucky in finding a used one and a lot of people jack

2666
01:59:42,240 --> 01:59:44,480
up the prices of those that are backwards compatible.

2667
01:59:44,480 --> 01:59:45,480
Thanks.

2668
01:59:45,480 --> 01:59:50,240
You know what's extra funny is that usually Dan and I wait until second releases come

2669
01:59:50,240 --> 01:59:55,920
out for when we get stuff because we're usually not initial adopters of consoles and phones

2670
01:59:55,920 --> 02:00:00,760
and stuff, but we got this right away and we sort of got a reward because our Discover

2671
02:00:00,760 --> 02:00:03,420
card gave us back a hundred bucks.

2672
02:00:03,420 --> 02:00:05,560
So would a new PS3 let you play a PS2 game?

2673
02:00:05,560 --> 02:00:08,040
Cause I know they still sell PS2 games.

2674
02:00:08,040 --> 02:00:09,040
Nope.

2675
02:00:09,040 --> 02:00:12,080
However, I think I've got an extra PS2 you could probably borrow.

2676
02:00:12,080 --> 02:00:16,660
But you can play, you can play PS1 games.

2677
02:00:16,660 --> 02:00:17,660
And imports, right?

2678
02:00:17,660 --> 02:00:18,660
Import PS1 games.

2679
02:00:18,660 --> 02:00:19,660
Uh, no.

2680
02:00:19,660 --> 02:00:24,240
The region locks are still in place for PS1 and PS2, but it's region free for the new

2681
02:00:24,240 --> 02:00:25,240
games.

2682
02:00:25,240 --> 02:00:26,240
That's right.

2683
02:00:26,240 --> 02:00:27,240
PS3 games are region free.

2684
02:00:27,240 --> 02:00:28,240
Yeah.

2685
02:00:28,240 --> 02:00:34,040
Which is interesting, but you might remember like Loki imported a, uh, uh, racing game

2686
02:00:34,040 --> 02:00:37,460
that he thought was awful, but he imported it.

2687
02:00:37,460 --> 02:00:42,480
So the, and the exciting thing is if BeatMania 2DX ever comes out on the PlayStation 3, you

2688
02:00:42,480 --> 02:00:46,720
know, that was a, I know that was the game that made me buy a Japanese PlayStation 2

2689
02:00:46,720 --> 02:00:47,720
so I could play it.

2690
02:00:47,720 --> 02:00:48,720
Same here.

2691
02:00:48,720 --> 02:00:50,640
That's how obsessed with this music game series I was.

2692
02:00:50,640 --> 02:00:54,300
If they do release that on PS3 in the future, which I hope they will, it's going to break

2693
02:00:54,300 --> 02:00:57,080
down that, that border essentially.

2694
02:00:57,080 --> 02:01:00,960
And if I want to just import it from a Japanese retailer, I'll be able to play it on my PS3.

2695
02:01:00,960 --> 02:01:05,500
I won't have to spend another $400 on an extra place to, and yes, I spent like 400 bucks

2696
02:01:05,500 --> 02:01:08,120
on a Japanese PS2 just so I could play the stupid game.

2697
02:01:08,120 --> 02:01:10,040
Yeah, we, we did ours too.

2698
02:01:10,040 --> 02:01:11,040
I know.

2699
02:01:11,040 --> 02:01:12,040
Yeah.

2700
02:01:12,040 --> 02:01:13,040
A lot of people did.

2701
02:01:13,040 --> 02:01:14,040
It wasn't just me.

2702
02:01:14,040 --> 02:01:16,260
I still have my old clunker at home.

2703
02:01:16,260 --> 02:01:20,360
My wonderful, the original PS2 box.

2704
02:01:20,360 --> 02:01:24,780
Props to those PS2s for holding up after all those years, cause I believe we heard a Bobby

2705
02:01:24,780 --> 02:01:28,460
on the show right before us talking about his Xbox 360 red ringed.

2706
02:01:28,460 --> 02:01:33,240
One of my friends just sent me a text over the weekend, my 360 red ringed frown face.

2707
02:01:33,240 --> 02:01:34,600
They don't build them like they used to.

2708
02:01:34,600 --> 02:01:35,600
No they don't.

2709
02:01:35,600 --> 02:01:41,000
My PS2 is still up and going because I don't use it that much, mostly for DVDs, but yeah,

2710
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:42,160
it still works.

2711
02:01:42,160 --> 02:01:45,760
I'm not, I'm not real confident about Sony optical drives.

2712
02:01:45,760 --> 02:01:48,080
Just bad experiences, but we'll see how long it lasts.

2713
02:01:48,080 --> 02:01:49,640
So far, so good.

2714
02:01:49,640 --> 02:01:52,200
Breslull's in our chat and says, I still want to get a JPS2.

2715
02:01:52,200 --> 02:01:54,840
Well, the good news is it's really cheap now.

2716
02:01:54,840 --> 02:01:59,560
You probably get it for only about a hundred now, maybe 120, 150 for Japanese PlayStation

2717
02:01:59,560 --> 02:02:00,560
2.

2718
02:02:00,560 --> 02:02:01,560
Yes.

2719
02:02:01,560 --> 02:02:04,240
But keep in mind, if you import a console from Japan, it's only going to play the Japanese

2720
02:02:04,240 --> 02:02:05,240
games.

2721
02:02:05,240 --> 02:02:08,520
So there's gotta be something out there that you can't get here.

2722
02:02:08,520 --> 02:02:09,800
Like dating Sims.

2723
02:02:09,800 --> 02:02:15,480
All right, let's go to our mailbag.

2724
02:02:15,480 --> 02:02:17,480
Let's see if some of the faces have changed in our mailbag.

2725
02:02:17,480 --> 02:02:20,360
We're talking about some things never change.

2726
02:02:20,360 --> 02:02:22,020
Let's see about the emails.

2727
02:02:22,020 --> 02:02:24,400
Mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com if you want to send us an email.

2728
02:02:24,400 --> 02:02:26,240
I think we've got quite a few this week, right, Jamie?

2729
02:02:26,240 --> 02:02:28,000
Uh, a few more, yeah.

2730
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:32,240
Hello, this is your friendly neighborhood Mexican, except in Arizona, act daft.

2731
02:02:32,240 --> 02:02:35,200
First of all, very late congrats on your eighth anniversary.

2732
02:02:35,200 --> 02:02:36,200
Keep up the good work.

2733
02:02:36,200 --> 02:02:37,520
Thank you, sir.

2734
02:02:37,520 --> 02:02:41,300
Now that I said that, I want to comment on some stuff you talked about on your last show.

2735
02:02:41,300 --> 02:02:43,840
First about the Kinect and the move.

2736
02:02:43,840 --> 02:02:45,800
You asked people if they're going to buy either of them.

2737
02:02:45,800 --> 02:02:49,840
I'll probably get the Kinect later when it gets cheaper because I don't really, because

2738
02:02:49,840 --> 02:02:53,760
I really want to try both Dance Central and Dance Master, and probably other games that

2739
02:02:53,760 --> 02:02:56,120
Microsoft may release in the future.

2740
02:02:56,120 --> 02:02:58,720
And Kinect does really look awesome.

2741
02:02:58,720 --> 02:03:01,080
But the move, first of all, I don't own a PS3 yet.

2742
02:03:01,080 --> 02:03:05,320
So before I get the move, I need a really good reason to get a PS3, which right now

2743
02:03:05,320 --> 02:03:06,320
is nothing.

2744
02:03:06,320 --> 02:03:11,360
Granted, there are a few PS3 exclusive games I do want, but they don't justify a reason

2745
02:03:11,360 --> 02:03:12,840
to get the console.

2746
02:03:12,840 --> 02:03:17,560
So before Sony tries to sell me a peripheral for any game at all, they should be working

2747
02:03:17,560 --> 02:03:21,840
on selling me the console itself, because like Loki said, the move is just going to

2748
02:03:21,840 --> 02:03:23,960
be the Wii with pretty graphics.

2749
02:03:23,960 --> 02:03:26,620
And I already have a Wii that I barely use.

2750
02:03:26,620 --> 02:03:32,680
I consider that their, excuse me, that their biggest problem and why the move may fail.

2751
02:03:32,680 --> 02:03:36,600
And the PlayStation Network in Mexico and other Latin American countries sucks.

2752
02:03:36,600 --> 02:03:41,160
Seriously, little to no content at all, and they want me to pay for a Plus service too?

2753
02:03:41,160 --> 02:03:42,160
Yeah, right.

2754
02:03:42,160 --> 02:03:45,320
Wow, this is a long email.

2755
02:03:45,320 --> 02:03:48,160
Another thing that you discussed was controllers versus keyboards and mouse.

2756
02:03:48,160 --> 02:03:51,720
I really think it comes down to what you're playing and how you're playing.

2757
02:03:51,720 --> 02:03:55,160
For first person shooters, sure, keyboard and mouse are way better because of precision

2758
02:03:55,160 --> 02:03:59,640
and other stuff, but for platformers or action games, I prefer controllers since it will

2759
02:03:59,640 --> 02:04:03,720
give more comfort and allow you to do more stuff like jumping and attacking.

2760
02:04:03,720 --> 02:04:07,680
I'm going to put two games as an example, Mirrors Edge and Psychonauts.

2761
02:04:07,680 --> 02:04:11,720
Mirrors Edge, while you can play with a keyboard and mouse just fine, there are a lot of button

2762
02:04:11,720 --> 02:04:15,480
combinations that are easier to do with a controller, and with Psychonauts, the game was designed

2763
02:04:15,480 --> 02:04:19,960
for consoles, so the keyboard controls are just plain awkward.

2764
02:04:19,960 --> 02:04:24,440
There are games that are easier with keyboard and mouse like Team Fortress 2 and Left 4 Dead,

2765
02:04:24,440 --> 02:04:29,040
not to mention point and click adventures, western RPGs, strategy games, or MMOs.

2766
02:04:29,040 --> 02:04:33,680
So I think you just need to learn both ways of controlling games and get the hang of both.

2767
02:04:33,680 --> 02:04:37,000
There's no better way of playing games in general, just a more comfortable way to play

2768
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:40,040
certain games, which I agree with, by the way.

2769
02:04:40,040 --> 02:04:44,720
So that's all I want to say, thanks for reading, until next time, PS, sorry my lack of articles

2770
02:04:44,720 --> 02:04:49,240
on the OLR main page, but no internet at home makes it difficult to do so, PSS, suck at

2771
02:04:49,240 --> 02:04:51,640
Arizona and your racist laws.

2772
02:04:51,640 --> 02:04:53,640
Deft is kabrown.

2773
02:04:53,640 --> 02:05:02,200
Um, well, I think, especially the keyboard mouse part, I think a lot of the debate usually

2774
02:05:02,200 --> 02:05:06,360
is around first person shooters, but definitely you bring up a good point about, you know,

2775
02:05:06,360 --> 02:05:10,160
it really depends on the type of game you're playing, absolutely, is that keyboard mouse

2776
02:05:10,160 --> 02:05:14,880
ain't gonna cut it, I think, as well for a game like Psychonauts, but for me, I don't

2777
02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:17,920
know if it's because, I don't even know how to explain it.

2778
02:05:17,920 --> 02:05:21,220
Like I used to play Quake just fine with keyboard and mouse, but some of these new games are

2779
02:05:21,220 --> 02:05:26,600
just too many buttons, where, I know, I know, but yet when I hold a controller in my hand,

2780
02:05:26,600 --> 02:05:27,600
it makes sense.

2781
02:05:27,600 --> 02:05:30,360
I can't explain it, I don't expect anyone else to understand it, just the way it is

2782
02:05:30,360 --> 02:05:31,360
for me.

2783
02:05:31,360 --> 02:05:35,880
I'll tell you what's funny is that when I was playing PSO, I could not, I mean you can

2784
02:05:35,880 --> 02:05:39,840
play it with a keyboard, it just was much more comfortable with a controller.

2785
02:05:39,840 --> 02:05:42,880
But Final Fantasy XI, everyone was saying, why aren't you playing with a keyboard, why

2786
02:05:42,880 --> 02:05:45,440
aren't you using a keyboard, why aren't you using a keyboard, I'm like, because I can

2787
02:05:45,440 --> 02:05:47,440
do just fine with my controller.

2788
02:05:47,440 --> 02:05:50,880
I wanted one for World of Warcraft, I hate playing World of Warcraft because I hate playing

2789
02:05:50,880 --> 02:05:51,880
it on the keyboard.

2790
02:05:51,880 --> 02:05:54,680
What about Star Trek Online, isn't that all keyboard?

2791
02:05:54,680 --> 02:06:00,200
It is, but for some reason, it's, when you get into space combat, it really helps to

2792
02:06:00,200 --> 02:06:02,880
have a mouse.

2793
02:06:02,880 --> 02:06:04,200
Interesting.

2794
02:06:04,200 --> 02:06:11,680
Because you can rotate your camera with it, as well as do direct targeting.

2795
02:06:11,680 --> 02:06:16,640
As well as the difference between, you know, even different versions of the same game,

2796
02:06:16,640 --> 02:06:20,120
like the different Wii versus, you know, PlayStation versions.

2797
02:06:20,120 --> 02:06:24,840
Like I played the original PlayStation 2 version of Okami, yay!

2798
02:06:24,840 --> 02:06:25,920
Fun game.

2799
02:06:25,920 --> 02:06:32,700
And then I played the Wii re-release, and surprisingly, I liked the PlayStation 1 better.

2800
02:06:32,700 --> 02:06:40,980
Because the Wii remote, I don't know what it was, it just felt more clunky.

2801
02:06:40,980 --> 02:06:42,320
You know what I mean?

2802
02:06:42,320 --> 02:06:48,480
It felt like it was rushed, it felt like it was, you know, it was, they were just trying

2803
02:06:48,480 --> 02:06:53,440
to hurry it out as fast as they could, and they didn't bother with the calibration that

2804
02:06:53,440 --> 02:06:56,460
they needed to make it good.

2805
02:06:56,460 --> 02:06:58,120
With PlayStation 2, you don't have that problem.

2806
02:06:58,120 --> 02:07:00,800
You do not have that problem with Okami.

2807
02:07:00,800 --> 02:07:02,800
So.

2808
02:07:02,800 --> 02:07:05,200
How about the next email?

2809
02:07:05,200 --> 02:07:07,200
We're fond of calling it the Wii-mote.

2810
02:07:07,200 --> 02:07:11,440
Instead of Wii remote, we call it the Wii-mote.

2811
02:07:11,440 --> 02:07:12,440
Wii-mote?

2812
02:07:12,440 --> 02:07:13,440
Wii-mote?

2813
02:07:13,440 --> 02:07:14,440
Ok.

2814
02:07:14,440 --> 02:07:15,440
I don't know this.

2815
02:07:15,440 --> 02:07:17,440
I don't own one.

2816
02:07:17,440 --> 02:07:20,320
Good morning, everyone.

2817
02:07:20,320 --> 02:07:21,320
This is Jeet.

2818
02:07:21,320 --> 02:07:22,320
It's the other Swede.

2819
02:07:22,320 --> 02:07:24,320
Writing in once again.

2820
02:07:24,320 --> 02:07:27,400
This time I'd like to comment a bit on the discussion that was brought forth last time

2821
02:07:27,400 --> 02:07:30,840
concerning the accuracy and comfort when it comes to controllers.

2822
02:07:30,840 --> 02:07:34,320
Now I could start a five page rant about why a mouse and keyboard is far superior to any

2823
02:07:34,320 --> 02:07:36,800
console controllers, but I won't.

2824
02:07:36,800 --> 02:07:41,080
The reason is that I am very biased, and due to that bias, I can't objectively say that

2825
02:07:41,080 --> 02:07:42,440
a mouse is better.

2826
02:07:42,440 --> 02:07:45,800
It's only a personal preference embedded in me during my childhood thanks to my uncle

2827
02:07:45,800 --> 02:07:48,000
who introduced me to PC gaming.

2828
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:52,040
It's simple, whatever controller you like, be it an Xbox 360 controller, PlayStation

2829
02:07:52,040 --> 02:07:56,600
Move, or mouse, it's only the best peripheral for you personally, not the whole world and

2830
02:07:56,600 --> 02:07:57,600
everyone in it.

2831
02:07:57,600 --> 02:07:58,600
Thank you.

2832
02:07:58,600 --> 02:08:04,600
To sum it up, the discussion of what control method is the quote best is pointless since

2833
02:08:04,600 --> 02:08:07,720
it all comes down to what you are skilled at using or prefer.

2834
02:08:07,720 --> 02:08:11,680
P.S. note that I didn't apologize for any spelling errors this time.

2835
02:08:11,680 --> 02:08:15,120
That's because I realized it's rude for someone who grew up with English as their primary

2836
02:08:15,120 --> 02:08:19,440
language to come into the minor flaws of someone who learned it as a second language.

2837
02:08:19,440 --> 02:08:22,040
Let's see you typing a letter to me in Swedish without grammatical errors in it.

2838
02:08:22,040 --> 02:08:23,760
I still love you, even you Dark Sakura.

2839
02:08:23,760 --> 02:08:24,760
Aww.

2840
02:08:24,760 --> 02:08:29,560
Anyway, if I know someone's typing from another country, I don't give them a hard time.

2841
02:08:29,560 --> 02:08:30,560
If I know.

2842
02:08:30,560 --> 02:08:32,560
If I don't, I'm sorry.

2843
02:08:32,560 --> 02:08:33,560
P.S.S.

2844
02:08:33,560 --> 02:08:35,880
Thanks for reading my letter and I hope your hand is feeling better.

2845
02:08:35,880 --> 02:08:38,120
Thank you, but it's not.

2846
02:08:38,120 --> 02:08:43,520
Drew Nami in our chatroom at chat.orangetownstrader.com says, IKEA controller for the Swedish email.

2847
02:08:43,520 --> 02:08:44,520
There you go.

2848
02:08:44,520 --> 02:08:45,520
Uh huh.

2849
02:08:45,520 --> 02:08:46,520
Uh huh.

2850
02:08:46,520 --> 02:08:50,320
And yeah, apparently it's international email night at Orange Island Radio, but hey, that's

2851
02:08:50,320 --> 02:08:53,080
awesome to know that we have listeners all over the globe.

2852
02:08:53,080 --> 02:08:54,080
That's so awesome.

2853
02:08:54,080 --> 02:08:55,080
Alright.

2854
02:08:55,080 --> 02:08:56,080
Next email.

2855
02:08:56,080 --> 02:08:57,080
Hey Orange Lounge.

2856
02:08:57,080 --> 02:08:58,080
Long time listener.

2857
02:08:58,080 --> 02:08:59,080
First time responder.

2858
02:08:59,080 --> 02:09:00,080
Oooh.

2859
02:09:00,080 --> 02:09:01,560
We got the cliche.

2860
02:09:01,560 --> 02:09:02,560
Love it.

2861
02:09:02,560 --> 02:09:07,080
As for the move, personally I think it will be the better motion control option.

2862
02:09:07,080 --> 02:09:11,360
Yes, the price point is high, but I think it will be the most accurate on the most powerful

2863
02:09:11,360 --> 02:09:12,880
system of the three.

2864
02:09:12,880 --> 02:09:17,120
I saw some great screen tests demonstrating its abilities and I think it could be a hardcore

2865
02:09:17,120 --> 02:09:18,800
alternative to the Wii.

2866
02:09:18,800 --> 02:09:20,400
That's the main reason I have avoided the Wii.

2867
02:09:20,400 --> 02:09:22,080
It lacks the hardcore devotions.

2868
02:09:22,080 --> 02:09:23,080
No five.

2869
02:09:23,080 --> 02:09:29,600
Just playing devil's advocate to your email, I kind of get that perspective and that's

2870
02:09:29,600 --> 02:09:34,040
why a lot of people have avoided the Wii, but what about games like Brawl and Metroid

2871
02:09:34,040 --> 02:09:36,960
Other M and some of these other kind of like, and GoldenEye, some of these are the cool

2872
02:09:36,960 --> 02:09:40,800
things that are on the Wii, I mean is that not hardcore enough?

2873
02:09:40,800 --> 02:09:41,800
No more heroes?

2874
02:09:41,800 --> 02:09:47,040
Yeah, I mean, I don't know, it's kind of like, it feels like there's some cool stuff on the

2875
02:09:47,040 --> 02:09:51,240
Wii, I mean granted maybe not as much, and yeah, Wii kind of made some errors when it

2876
02:09:51,240 --> 02:09:55,720
comes to not being online, I think that's one of their biggest flaws is that the multiplayer

2877
02:09:55,720 --> 02:10:00,120
online is just a joke, you know, compared to what else is out there.

2878
02:10:00,120 --> 02:10:02,640
I agree.

2879
02:10:02,640 --> 02:10:04,280
But appreciate the perspective.

2880
02:10:04,280 --> 02:10:05,760
We have two more emails to go.

2881
02:10:05,760 --> 02:10:06,760
No!

2882
02:10:06,760 --> 02:10:07,760
Too bad!

2883
02:10:07,760 --> 02:10:10,800
Hello, OLR, I have been listening for about three months and I love the show, although

2884
02:10:10,800 --> 02:10:14,560
I must admit that I'm not a music game person myself, I'd much rather RPGs but teach their

2885
02:10:14,560 --> 02:10:15,560
own.

2886
02:10:15,560 --> 02:10:17,000
I'm dropping this to you for three reasons.

2887
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:20,600
First I was wondering what job Loki has that he's able to play Xbox at work.

2888
02:10:20,600 --> 02:10:21,600
Would love that job.

2889
02:10:21,600 --> 02:10:25,120
Second, he's not using any periods by the way.

2890
02:10:25,120 --> 02:10:28,240
Oh, that's why you sound like an auctioneer.

2891
02:10:28,240 --> 02:10:29,240
Yes.

2892
02:10:29,240 --> 02:10:32,680
Second is I was wondering if there was a way to get the livestream via mobile platform,

2893
02:10:32,680 --> 02:10:33,680
i.e. a moto-droid.

2894
02:10:33,680 --> 02:10:39,320
Third, is actually two things in the first letting, being that Dark Soccer is a fiend

2895
02:10:39,320 --> 02:10:42,320
for grammar, spelling, and punctuation, I thought it might interest her to know that

2896
02:10:42,320 --> 02:10:47,080
this site has lasted, has several, lastly I wonder what point during this email she

2897
02:10:47,080 --> 02:10:49,040
stops reading this and starts to have convulsions.

2898
02:10:49,040 --> 02:10:53,080
As I've written this without punctuation and have made several misspellings and several

2899
02:10:53,080 --> 02:10:56,520
grammatical errors on purpose, not that I don't like her or anything, I just thought

2900
02:10:56,520 --> 02:10:59,920
that it might get a giggle, good times all and keep up the good work.

2901
02:10:59,920 --> 02:11:07,120
I had to figure, I figured by then it was, hey you did, you did use a punctuation mark.

2902
02:11:07,120 --> 02:11:11,120
You gotta laugh out of me anytime somebody writes in to give Dark Soccer some shit, I

2903
02:11:11,120 --> 02:11:12,120
love it.

2904
02:11:12,120 --> 02:11:16,760
No, I'm laughing at this because I realized by that point that it was on purpose.

2905
02:11:16,760 --> 02:11:19,120
So this is a punctuation troll.

2906
02:11:19,120 --> 02:11:24,680
Wow, we have our first grammar troll on Orange Lounge Radio, that's awesome.

2907
02:11:24,680 --> 02:11:25,680
You get a gold star.

2908
02:11:25,680 --> 02:11:26,680
You totally get a gold star.

2909
02:11:26,680 --> 02:11:30,920
And this is from Kane I Am, I didn't sign it but I'm taking it from the email.

2910
02:11:30,920 --> 02:11:35,640
Kane I Am, you get a gold star for being the first grammar troll at Orange Lounge Radio.

2911
02:11:35,640 --> 02:11:38,440
And the subject of the subject is Wee Yay Wahoo.

2912
02:11:38,440 --> 02:11:42,400
Please, that is not encouraging others to copy what this gentleman has done.

2913
02:11:42,400 --> 02:11:46,480
Yeah, because if you do it the first time, you're clever, anyone who does it the second

2914
02:11:46,480 --> 02:11:47,480
time is stupid.

2915
02:11:47,480 --> 02:11:50,120
Alright, what was the real question here though?

2916
02:11:50,120 --> 02:11:53,040
There was something in there I actually wanted to answer that had come up in there.

2917
02:11:53,040 --> 02:11:54,440
Oh, Loki's Job.

2918
02:11:54,440 --> 02:11:55,880
He works for a game distributor.

2919
02:11:55,880 --> 02:12:02,480
So he actually, like he's kind of the middle man between gaming companies and the actual

2920
02:12:02,480 --> 02:12:03,480
stores.

2921
02:12:03,480 --> 02:12:04,480
Yeah.

2922
02:12:04,480 --> 02:12:09,320
Because it's very hard for a gaming company to manage all these stores directly, so they

2923
02:12:09,320 --> 02:12:11,720
use distributors to kind of be the middle men.

2924
02:12:11,720 --> 02:12:14,400
And that's basically what he does, he works for the distributor.

2925
02:12:14,400 --> 02:12:16,320
And then there was something right after that about...

2926
02:12:16,320 --> 02:12:19,680
About being able to listen to us on mobile, because he's got a Moto Droid 3rd.

2927
02:12:19,680 --> 02:12:20,680
Okay, I...

2928
02:12:20,680 --> 02:12:22,680
Sorry, a Moto Droid.

2929
02:12:22,680 --> 02:12:25,160
We have, well I know that for iPhone we use apps.

2930
02:12:25,160 --> 02:12:31,640
There's an all games app on the iPhone supposedly, but I guess it disappeared this week, so I

2931
02:12:31,640 --> 02:12:33,480
don't know what's going on there.

2932
02:12:33,480 --> 02:12:37,040
That's a Scott question, not a Rob question, so I don't know.

2933
02:12:37,040 --> 02:12:41,880
But I will say this, any program that can use Shoutcast can listen to the all game stream.

2934
02:12:41,880 --> 02:12:45,440
You just have to get the link for the Shoutcast feed, it's a little silly for me to yell it

2935
02:12:45,440 --> 02:12:46,440
out here.

2936
02:12:46,440 --> 02:12:49,200
I think Pandora has a...

2937
02:12:49,200 --> 02:12:50,200
Go to all...

2938
02:12:50,200 --> 02:12:51,200
Well Pandora's...

2939
02:12:51,200 --> 02:12:52,200
Does it have Shoutcast mode in it though?

2940
02:12:52,200 --> 02:12:53,200
I don't know.

2941
02:12:53,200 --> 02:12:54,200
I don't know.

2942
02:12:54,200 --> 02:12:58,000
But most mobile phones have some type of Shoutcast tuner app, I mean anything that's like, listen

2943
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:01,640
to thousands of internet radio stations, it's probably a Shoutcast app.

2944
02:13:01,640 --> 02:13:06,320
And if you go to allgames.com you can get the link to listen to all games radio.

2945
02:13:06,320 --> 02:13:07,320
Yeah.

2946
02:13:07,320 --> 02:13:08,320
Pretty easy.

2947
02:13:08,320 --> 02:13:11,680
Okay, and then the grammar thing.

2948
02:13:11,680 --> 02:13:15,000
Which I'm laughing, I'm actually laughing, because I realized it was on purpose.

2949
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:16,000
How funny, Tiger...

2950
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:18,720
I'm sorry, I have to say this, Tigercall on our chatroom is saying since the all games

2951
02:13:18,720 --> 02:13:22,880
app isn't up right now, you can get the Video Game Outsiders iPhone app, because they're

2952
02:13:22,880 --> 02:13:25,420
another show on the network, they do Tuesdays here.

2953
02:13:25,420 --> 02:13:28,440
And I guess their app does it.

2954
02:13:28,440 --> 02:13:29,440
That's cool.

2955
02:13:29,440 --> 02:13:31,160
So, I guess a backup.

2956
02:13:31,160 --> 02:13:35,480
Okay, and the last one.

2957
02:13:35,480 --> 02:13:37,760
Greetings OLR, Rini here.

2958
02:13:37,760 --> 02:13:42,020
I will soon be the proud owner of a new Beatles Rock Band limited edition bundle that I scored

2959
02:13:42,020 --> 02:13:43,020
for 20 bucks.

2960
02:13:43,020 --> 02:13:44,020
Wow.

2961
02:13:44,020 --> 02:13:48,400
I have not owned a Rock Band game until now, so I was wondering if you and the listeners

2962
02:13:48,400 --> 02:13:54,400
could give any advice on what I should know about keeping my gear in great condition.

2963
02:13:54,400 --> 02:14:00,160
I would say, sanitize it if other people play it.

2964
02:14:00,160 --> 02:14:03,400
Especially if they have greasy fingers.

2965
02:14:03,400 --> 02:14:06,320
Or liquor is being mixed with those controllers.

2966
02:14:06,320 --> 02:14:07,320
Seriously.

2967
02:14:07,320 --> 02:14:14,400
Yes, those monitor wipes that you can use to clean your computer screen, those might

2968
02:14:14,400 --> 02:14:15,480
be good for it.

2969
02:14:15,480 --> 02:14:18,080
Alcohol prep pads, yo.

2970
02:14:18,080 --> 02:14:19,440
Because alcohol just dries.

2971
02:14:19,440 --> 02:14:21,600
Clorox wipes are like the greatest invention ever.

2972
02:14:21,600 --> 02:14:23,040
Yeah, but you gotta be careful with those.

2973
02:14:23,040 --> 02:14:25,480
That's true, you don't want to bleach your controllers like a sister.

2974
02:14:25,480 --> 02:14:29,600
The horrible thing is, when you said, you know, if alcohol is being mixed with us drinks,

2975
02:14:29,600 --> 02:14:36,360
I got this horrible mental image of a Rock Band controller mixing a giant vat of alcohol.

2976
02:14:36,360 --> 02:14:38,520
I wouldn't use it for that purpose.

2977
02:14:38,520 --> 02:14:42,160
You must hate your Rock Band if you're doing that, wow.

2978
02:14:42,160 --> 02:14:48,760
And also, when you store them, make sure that you don't have them stacked up haphazardly.

2979
02:14:48,760 --> 02:14:54,600
We usually stand ours up on end and put them in a corner to where they won't really fall

2980
02:14:54,600 --> 02:14:55,600
on each other.

2981
02:14:55,600 --> 02:14:58,280
If you really want to take good care of them, and this is the way to do it, just go get

2982
02:14:58,280 --> 02:15:01,500
one of those big plastic storage tubs at Target.

2983
02:15:01,500 --> 02:15:03,320
It would cost you only a couple bucks.

2984
02:15:03,320 --> 02:15:06,840
IKEA would have them too, any place ought to have it.

2985
02:15:06,840 --> 02:15:12,320
You can just get a big storage tub and put your drum kit and your guitar in there, and

2986
02:15:12,320 --> 02:15:17,000
then that way it won't get a crap ton of dust on it, it won't be left out to be kicked and

2987
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:18,560
pushed around and fall over.

2988
02:15:18,560 --> 02:15:23,320
With all my Baymani stuff, we would typically just put them back in the box.

2989
02:15:23,320 --> 02:15:24,320
That's dedication.

2990
02:15:24,320 --> 02:15:28,840
I don't know if, especially I think the guitar is in pieces in the Rock Band box, I want

2991
02:15:28,840 --> 02:15:29,840
to say.

2992
02:15:29,840 --> 02:15:30,840
I don't know if I'd want to put it back together.

2993
02:15:30,840 --> 02:15:35,560
We can do that with our Rock Band ones, but for the ones that we could, we would do that.

2994
02:15:35,560 --> 02:15:38,280
Plastic tubs, if you have the space for it, would be great.

2995
02:15:38,280 --> 02:15:42,520
Of course I will be getting Rock Band, Rock Band 2, and Lego Rock Band very soon, so please

2996
02:15:42,520 --> 02:15:45,960
kindly randomly blurt out any good download content songs.

2997
02:15:45,960 --> 02:15:46,960
Thanks.

2998
02:15:46,960 --> 02:15:47,960
P.S.

2999
02:15:47,960 --> 02:15:49,720
Give Dark Sakura more ginger ale, dude.

3000
02:15:49,720 --> 02:15:52,160
Don't stop believin'.

3001
02:15:52,160 --> 02:15:53,160
Is really all you need.

3002
02:15:53,160 --> 02:15:55,120
Skullcrusher Mountain.

3003
02:15:55,120 --> 02:15:57,400
Definitely look for the free stuff on the marketplace.

3004
02:15:57,400 --> 02:15:58,640
Jonathan Coulton stuff.

3005
02:15:58,640 --> 02:16:00,440
It's really about what type of music you're into.

3006
02:16:00,440 --> 02:16:02,960
And Stephen Colbert.

3007
02:16:02,960 --> 02:16:03,960
Lady Gaga.

3008
02:16:03,960 --> 02:16:04,960
Blah.

3009
02:16:04,960 --> 02:16:05,960
Blah yourself.

3010
02:16:05,960 --> 02:16:06,960
Haters.

3011
02:16:06,960 --> 02:16:07,960
Haters.

3012
02:16:07,960 --> 02:16:08,960
Haters.

3013
02:16:08,960 --> 02:16:09,960
We're not...

3014
02:16:09,960 --> 02:16:10,960
Haters gonna hate, Rob.

3015
02:16:10,960 --> 02:16:11,960
Haters gonna hate.

3016
02:16:11,960 --> 02:16:12,960
That's right.

3017
02:16:12,960 --> 02:16:13,960
Oh boy.

3018
02:16:13,960 --> 02:16:14,960
That's it.

3019
02:16:14,960 --> 02:16:15,960
You can't...

3020
02:16:15,960 --> 02:16:16,960
Stop the hate.

3021
02:16:16,960 --> 02:16:17,960
That's right.

3022
02:16:17,960 --> 02:16:22,360
I have actually said this, Rob, and I made this statement clear when we went out to Vick's

3023
02:16:22,360 --> 02:16:28,600
Ice Cream downtown, that I do not dislike Lady Gaga.

3024
02:16:28,600 --> 02:16:33,920
I dislike the radio versions of her songs, but every time I've heard piano versions,

3025
02:16:33,920 --> 02:16:35,560
I've really liked them.

3026
02:16:35,560 --> 02:16:36,560
Okay.

3027
02:16:36,560 --> 02:16:37,560
Okay.

3028
02:16:37,560 --> 02:16:38,560
So, it's...

3029
02:16:38,560 --> 02:16:39,560
No one-ker.

3030
02:16:39,560 --> 02:16:45,680
I thought you just disliked the performance art aspects of her videos.

3031
02:16:45,680 --> 02:16:46,680
Videos get you...

3032
02:16:46,680 --> 02:16:50,200
Well, I don't like her videos, but I mean, I like the video for Alejandro.

3033
02:16:50,200 --> 02:16:53,360
I don't like the videos, but the songs are pretty awesome.

3034
02:16:53,360 --> 02:16:54,360
I like video games.

3035
02:16:54,360 --> 02:16:55,360
All right, let's...

3036
02:16:55,360 --> 02:16:56,480
Yes, let's go on.

3037
02:16:56,480 --> 02:16:57,880
I also like Angst.

3038
02:16:57,880 --> 02:17:02,360
What a perfect segue into our FUs of the week.

3039
02:17:02,360 --> 02:17:04,360
Yay.

3040
02:17:04,360 --> 02:17:20,280
And now, for those new to Orange Lounge Radio, this is the part of the show where we just

3041
02:17:20,280 --> 02:17:24,960
say a big FU to whatever we're going to say an FU to all week, Dark Soccer.

3042
02:17:24,960 --> 02:17:30,520
FU to the hole in my hand, and to my husband's blood pressure.

3043
02:17:30,520 --> 02:17:36,040
We're going to beat you, butthead, okay.

3044
02:17:36,040 --> 02:17:40,400
I'm going to give an FU to all the sand in my hypothetical vagina that I apparently have

3045
02:17:40,400 --> 02:17:41,400
today.

3046
02:17:41,400 --> 02:17:42,400
I just...

3047
02:17:42,400 --> 02:17:46,880
Are you feeling a little gritty and not so fresh?

3048
02:17:46,880 --> 02:17:48,880
Yes.

3049
02:17:48,880 --> 02:17:56,200
I have to say a big FU to any gaming company who is willing to charge multiple dollars

3050
02:17:56,200 --> 02:17:59,120
for copies of games that I already own.

3051
02:17:59,120 --> 02:18:03,600
Yes, I'm talking to you, PlayStation.

3052
02:18:03,600 --> 02:18:10,000
Okay, the biggest FU, well, general FUs all around to...

3053
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:11,720
Let's see, the list is long and distinguished.

3054
02:18:11,720 --> 02:18:12,720
We'll keep it short.

3055
02:18:12,720 --> 02:18:18,240
Fox News, Sarah Palin, Meg Whitman, boo!

3056
02:18:18,240 --> 02:18:19,240
Carly Fiona?

3057
02:18:19,240 --> 02:18:20,240
Oh God, no.

3058
02:18:20,240 --> 02:18:21,480
I thought you were keeping it short.

3059
02:18:21,480 --> 02:18:23,680
Yeah, yeah, I am keeping it short.

3060
02:18:23,680 --> 02:18:28,280
And the whole Republican Party, go rot, FU.

3061
02:18:28,280 --> 02:18:29,920
That won't generate any emails tonight.

3062
02:18:29,920 --> 02:18:34,240
By the way, by the way, by the way, Rob, as an official woman, you can have an honorary

3063
02:18:34,240 --> 02:18:35,240
veg.

3064
02:18:35,240 --> 02:18:38,360
Oh yay, just I've always wanted...

3065
02:18:38,360 --> 02:18:39,880
You can keep it.

3066
02:18:39,880 --> 02:18:41,760
These things are nothing but trouble.

3067
02:18:41,760 --> 02:18:46,800
So you don't have to have a hypothetical one, you can have an honorary one.

3068
02:18:46,800 --> 02:18:47,800
I don't want one.

3069
02:18:47,800 --> 02:18:48,800
What's the difference?

3070
02:18:48,800 --> 02:18:49,800
I...

3071
02:18:49,800 --> 02:18:50,800
They're both non-existent.

3072
02:18:50,800 --> 02:18:54,520
Send it back, return to sender.

3073
02:18:54,520 --> 02:18:55,520
The warranty experience, sorry.

3074
02:18:55,520 --> 02:18:56,520
Do not want.

3075
02:18:56,520 --> 02:19:01,120
Rob's pet vag.

3076
02:19:01,120 --> 02:19:02,120
My little vag.

3077
02:19:02,120 --> 02:19:05,800
Hmm, there's a product idea for Hasbro.

3078
02:19:05,800 --> 02:19:06,800
What?

3079
02:19:06,800 --> 02:19:08,800
Imagine vagina.

3080
02:19:08,800 --> 02:19:15,400
All right, anyhow, let's move on.

3081
02:19:15,400 --> 02:19:19,920
Loki is in our chat room right now, he's in the chat, he joined on the hospital Wi-Fi.

3082
02:19:19,920 --> 02:19:20,920
He's in chat right now.

3083
02:19:20,920 --> 02:19:23,080
Woot for free Wi-Fi, I second that.

3084
02:19:23,080 --> 02:19:27,520
I don't know if he's listening or what, I just sent him a private message if I can call

3085
02:19:27,520 --> 02:19:30,920
him, but I don't know if he can see, he probably can't hear.

3086
02:19:30,920 --> 02:19:37,920
Free slow Wi-Fi, that's what you get when it's free Wi-Fi, it's slow Wi-Fi.

3087
02:19:37,920 --> 02:19:41,200
I don't know, so we'll see if we can call him or not, we'll see.

3088
02:19:41,200 --> 02:19:43,400
But for now we're gonna keep on moving with the news.

3089
02:19:43,400 --> 02:19:49,120
Ah, let's see, Metroid Other M, now here's a Wii game that's gonna be pretty hardcore

3090
02:19:49,120 --> 02:19:53,160
for that person earlier, but yeah, I'm excited about this game, I'm finally gonna dust off

3091
02:19:53,160 --> 02:19:55,400
the Wii after like six months of not playing it.

3092
02:19:55,400 --> 02:19:58,500
This is kind of an interesting mode they're putting in the game, it's gonna be a theater

3093
02:19:58,500 --> 02:20:04,640
mode in Metroid Other M. That's right, if you wanna just watch the movie Metroid Other

3094
02:20:04,640 --> 02:20:06,600
M, you can do that.

3095
02:20:06,600 --> 02:20:11,080
That's right, there's a theater mode according to one of the designers at Nintendo, Yoshio

3096
02:20:11,080 --> 02:20:14,920
Sakamoto, there's a theater mode that lets you view all of the cutscenes linked together

3097
02:20:14,920 --> 02:20:17,160
seamlessly as a single movie.

3098
02:20:17,160 --> 02:20:20,840
We placed just as much weight on enjoying the story as we did on the action aspects

3099
02:20:20,840 --> 02:20:25,520
of the game, but it's hard to fully communicate a storyline in a video game with just one

3100
02:20:25,520 --> 02:20:26,520
playthrough.

3101
02:20:26,520 --> 02:20:30,400
At the same time though, it's asking a lot of players to beat the game twice to get it

3102
02:20:30,400 --> 02:20:33,280
all, so that's where the idea for that mode came from.

3103
02:20:33,280 --> 02:20:36,960
It lets you make a lot of discoveries, things you missed, or dialogue that makes more sense

3104
02:20:36,960 --> 02:20:38,160
in retrospect.

3105
02:20:38,160 --> 02:20:42,040
I hope it helps people understand the story better.

3106
02:20:42,040 --> 02:20:43,040
Interesting approach.

3107
02:20:43,040 --> 02:20:44,040
Nice!

3108
02:20:44,040 --> 02:20:51,280
That almost kind of reminds me of Final Fantasy X, they had the theater that was in Luka that

3109
02:20:51,280 --> 02:20:55,320
you could go to and buy the individual cutscenes, which was really nice when you wanted to look

3110
02:20:55,320 --> 02:20:56,320
at them all together.

3111
02:20:56,320 --> 02:20:59,480
Yeah, and I was gonna say, people have been kind of doing this whole cutscene movie thing

3112
02:20:59,480 --> 02:21:04,380
for years, like I'm pretty sure I could probably go on YouTube and just see nothing but cutscenes

3113
02:21:04,380 --> 02:21:08,240
from some of the more recent Final Fantasy games, get a pretty good sense of what the

3114
02:21:08,240 --> 02:21:09,240
story's all about.

3115
02:21:09,240 --> 02:21:13,640
So, kind of interesting that the game is now officially endorsing that idea, but I like

3116
02:21:13,640 --> 02:21:15,280
his reasoning behind it.

3117
02:21:15,280 --> 02:21:18,120
He's just kind of like, you know what, you shouldn't have to beat the game twice to get

3118
02:21:18,120 --> 02:21:20,320
everything.

3119
02:21:20,320 --> 02:21:25,660
And you might kind of go, it's Nintendo Easy Mode, just hit the button or whatever, but

3120
02:21:25,660 --> 02:21:29,880
you know, I'll give him a little credit.

3121
02:21:29,880 --> 02:21:33,120
I think something as epic as Metroid is worthy of a theater mode.

3122
02:21:33,120 --> 02:21:37,360
So is it cheating if you watch the whole movie first and then you play the game?

3123
02:21:37,360 --> 02:21:41,480
Yes, but in my opinion that's no worse than going on the internet and reading the entire

3124
02:21:41,480 --> 02:21:42,960
FAQ before you play the game.

3125
02:21:42,960 --> 02:21:43,960
Good point.

3126
02:21:43,960 --> 02:21:44,960
Yeah, true.

3127
02:21:44,960 --> 02:21:46,440
I mean, is it really any worse?

3128
02:21:46,440 --> 02:21:50,280
So, I'm okay with it.

3129
02:21:50,280 --> 02:21:53,560
Let's see, Tigerclaw says, now the question is how long is the theater mode?

3130
02:21:53,560 --> 02:21:56,600
Usually cutscenes, when you add them all together, they aren't usually an hour.

3131
02:21:56,600 --> 02:21:58,340
They're saying two hours.

3132
02:21:58,340 --> 02:22:01,540
Two hours is divided into chapters just like a DVD.

3133
02:22:01,540 --> 02:22:08,480
It's not just the cutscenes, there's actually prerecorded gameplay that will be intertwined

3134
02:22:08,480 --> 02:22:09,480
with it.

3135
02:22:09,480 --> 02:22:14,920
Although, I guess at one point they wanted to actually have recorded bits of you playing

3136
02:22:14,920 --> 02:22:19,440
the game that would then go into theater mode, but it's too big of a pain in the ass, basically,

3137
02:22:19,440 --> 02:22:20,440
and I'll tell you why.

3138
02:22:20,440 --> 02:22:22,920
It's because there's no decent storage on the Wii.

3139
02:22:22,920 --> 02:22:25,360
Even though it's not what they're saying, I'm totally filling in the gaps there and

3140
02:22:25,360 --> 02:22:27,640
making it up, it's got to be the reason.

3141
02:22:27,640 --> 02:22:29,020
You can't store that information.

3142
02:22:29,020 --> 02:22:31,160
But it is watching an actual movie.

3143
02:22:31,160 --> 02:22:32,160
Pretty much.

3144
02:22:32,160 --> 02:22:33,160
That's kind of cool.

3145
02:22:33,160 --> 02:22:34,160
That's nice.

3146
02:22:34,160 --> 02:22:35,160
I mean, how many people are perfectly content?

3147
02:22:35,160 --> 02:22:39,760
DarkSakura comes in here and a lot of her gaming weeks usually are, I watched Dan play

3148
02:22:39,760 --> 02:22:40,760
blank.

3149
02:22:40,760 --> 02:22:44,040
There's a lot of people that game by watching other people game.

3150
02:22:44,040 --> 02:22:49,200
Well, yeah, I mean, part of it for me is that he'll play a lot of single player stuff and

3151
02:22:49,200 --> 02:22:53,480
loves to just, you know, completely dominate the front room.

3152
02:22:53,480 --> 02:22:57,440
So usually if I'm out there and he's playing something, it's just me watching him play

3153
02:22:57,440 --> 02:22:58,440
something.

3154
02:22:58,440 --> 02:22:59,980
Especially now since I had my hand surgery.

3155
02:22:59,980 --> 02:23:03,520
You know, I really get a lot of enjoyment out of just sitting down watching him play.

3156
02:23:03,520 --> 02:23:08,760
Like I could sit and watch him play Grand Theft Horse for a while because it was very

3157
02:23:08,760 --> 02:23:09,760
cinematic.

3158
02:23:09,760 --> 02:23:11,800
Isn't watching games boring?

3159
02:23:11,800 --> 02:23:12,800
No.

3160
02:23:12,800 --> 02:23:13,800
No.

3161
02:23:13,800 --> 02:23:14,800
It's like watching a movie.

3162
02:23:14,800 --> 02:23:18,840
Actually, I have a DVD that's all the cut scenes of Final Fantasy X-2.

3163
02:23:18,840 --> 02:23:21,600
Alan will watch me PVP and wow and he enjoys it.

3164
02:23:21,600 --> 02:23:24,560
Of course, he likes to play backseat driver too, but that's okay.

3165
02:23:24,560 --> 02:23:25,560
It's fun.

3166
02:23:25,560 --> 02:23:26,560
I like doing that.

3167
02:23:26,560 --> 02:23:27,560
It's cool.

3168
02:23:27,560 --> 02:23:34,080
Alright, um, Dark Sakura, one more story and then I've got one more story as well and then

3169
02:23:34,080 --> 02:23:37,840
we're going to get to the phones, 877 game OLR in just a moment.

3170
02:23:37,840 --> 02:23:41,120
It's kind of funny because this is something I downloaded and never got a chance to play.

3171
02:23:41,120 --> 02:23:43,360
I was actually sitting here trying to play it.

3172
02:23:43,360 --> 02:23:49,040
Um, it was the Gorillaz Escape to Plastic Beach, which is on iPad and iPhone.

3173
02:23:49,040 --> 02:23:50,040
Oh, nice.

3174
02:23:50,040 --> 02:23:51,040
And, uh.

3175
02:23:51,040 --> 02:23:52,040
Good band.

3176
02:23:52,040 --> 02:23:53,040
What's that about?

3177
02:23:53,040 --> 02:23:59,640
Well, it's basically, it's them trying to get to the Plastic Beach and, like, you either

3178
02:23:59,640 --> 02:24:07,120
play, you play Murdock who flies on a Doom Glider and, um, he's trying to keep 2D from

3179
02:24:07,120 --> 02:24:08,120
escaping.

3180
02:24:08,120 --> 02:24:09,120
Nice.

3181
02:24:09,120 --> 02:24:17,480
You know, so it's, uh, it's only $1.99 and, um, you can get it as a browser game too.

3182
02:24:17,480 --> 02:24:19,640
So, uh, it's pretty cute.

3183
02:24:19,640 --> 02:24:21,520
Like, here, let me, let me start it up again.

3184
02:24:21,520 --> 02:24:26,600
I know this is fantastic cause you won't probably be able to hear it very well, but, um.

3185
02:24:26,600 --> 02:24:27,840
It seems interesting to me though.

3186
02:24:27,840 --> 02:24:31,980
I mean, usually these are the type of things you put out before an album comes out to kind

3187
02:24:31,980 --> 02:24:34,060
of raise awareness about it.

3188
02:24:34,060 --> 02:24:36,680
So it's a little weird that this is coming out now.

3189
02:24:36,680 --> 02:24:40,360
Is this picking up?

3190
02:24:40,360 --> 02:24:41,360
Very quietly.

3191
02:24:41,360 --> 02:24:44,080
Most of our listeners probably won't be able to hear it very well.

3192
02:24:44,080 --> 02:24:48,200
Headphone people will probably be able to hear it okay, but speaker people probably

3193
02:24:48,200 --> 02:24:49,200
not.

3194
02:24:49,200 --> 02:24:50,200
Yeah.

3195
02:24:50,200 --> 02:24:53,440
I'm trying to let you hear the beginning of it.

3196
02:24:53,440 --> 02:24:54,440
It's loading.

3197
02:24:54,440 --> 02:24:55,440
It's just beep, beep, boops.

3198
02:24:55,440 --> 02:24:57,440
Oh, we can hear it there a little bit.

3199
02:24:57,440 --> 02:25:01,440
I need to get away.

3200
02:25:01,440 --> 02:25:04,440
Oh, I'm so British.

3201
02:25:04,440 --> 02:25:08,760
He's left a key in your car.

3202
02:25:08,760 --> 02:25:10,760
Catch me if you can.

3203
02:25:10,760 --> 02:25:15,720
Oh, are you running a Monty Python skit on your iPhone?

3204
02:25:15,720 --> 02:25:18,760
That's what it sounds like a little bit, doesn't it?

3205
02:25:18,760 --> 02:25:19,760
So cute.

3206
02:25:19,760 --> 02:25:23,600
It is actually the actual voice actors and everything.

3207
02:25:23,600 --> 02:25:24,600
Nice.

3208
02:25:24,600 --> 02:25:26,600
Making more money off the characters, but hey, you know what?

3209
02:25:26,600 --> 02:25:30,680
If they can have Britney Spears apps and sing along to Lady Tap Tap Bieber or whatever those

3210
02:25:30,680 --> 02:25:31,680
games are.

3211
02:25:31,680 --> 02:25:34,280
She's such a cute little girl.

3212
02:25:34,280 --> 02:25:35,280
Who?

3213
02:25:35,280 --> 02:25:36,280
Justine Bieber.

3214
02:25:36,280 --> 02:25:37,280
That's awesome.

3215
02:25:37,280 --> 02:25:41,360
I was like, who are you talking about?

3216
02:25:41,360 --> 02:25:42,360
Britney Spears?

3217
02:25:42,360 --> 02:25:43,360
She's not a little girl anymore.

3218
02:25:43,360 --> 02:25:44,360
No, Justine Bieber.

3219
02:25:44,360 --> 02:25:45,360
Oh, Justine Bieber.

3220
02:25:45,360 --> 02:25:46,360
Okay.

3221
02:25:46,360 --> 02:25:48,360
She's the cutest little lesbian, I swear.

3222
02:25:48,360 --> 02:25:54,360
I'm a big Gorillaz fan, so this is so cute, but man, though looking at the iPad version

3223
02:25:54,360 --> 02:25:57,400
though, I'd really love to play the iPad one.

3224
02:25:57,400 --> 02:25:58,400
It looks like fun.

3225
02:25:58,400 --> 02:26:01,440
It looks very much like a Murdoch is Doom Glider.

3226
02:26:01,440 --> 02:26:05,840
One more story for you guys about a guy who now will have plenty of money to develop games

3227
02:26:05,840 --> 02:26:06,840
on the iPad.

3228
02:26:06,840 --> 02:26:11,720
If he chooses to Richard Garriott, he is the guy that made Ultima many, many years

3229
02:26:11,720 --> 02:26:12,720
ago.

3230
02:26:12,720 --> 02:26:13,720
Remember Ultima?

3231
02:26:13,720 --> 02:26:14,720
It was epic epicness.

3232
02:26:14,720 --> 02:26:15,720
It was an awesome, awesome.

3233
02:26:15,720 --> 02:26:17,880
I know I spent a lot of time playing Ultima Exodus.

3234
02:26:17,880 --> 02:26:23,320
He made a game a little less successful called Tabula Rasa a couple of years ago.

3235
02:26:23,320 --> 02:26:24,320
Remember that?

3236
02:26:24,320 --> 02:26:31,320
Well, Tabula Rasa closed of course, and NCsoft was the company behind Tabula Rasa and Richard

3237
02:26:31,320 --> 02:26:34,560
Garriott was not happy with the way things went.

3238
02:26:34,560 --> 02:26:42,240
In fact, he sued NCsoft for fraud, breach of contract, misrepresentation because he's

3239
02:26:42,240 --> 02:26:46,400
saying he didn't voluntarily leave the company as NCsoft claimed.

3240
02:26:46,400 --> 02:26:47,400
Ooh.

3241
02:26:47,400 --> 02:26:48,400
Well, here's the deal.

3242
02:26:48,400 --> 02:26:52,400
Apparently, it came out today that out of the 47 million that Richard Garriott was

3243
02:26:52,400 --> 02:26:56,240
seeking, he was actually awarded $28 million.

3244
02:26:56,240 --> 02:26:57,240
Touching.

3245
02:26:57,240 --> 02:26:58,240
Yikes.

3246
02:26:58,240 --> 02:26:59,480
So, there you go.

3247
02:26:59,480 --> 02:27:02,960
Apparently, they did find that there was some misrepresentation going on there and some

3248
02:27:02,960 --> 02:27:07,640
contracts were breached and so forth.

3249
02:27:07,640 --> 02:27:08,680
Very unfortunate.

3250
02:27:08,680 --> 02:27:09,680
You know what's unfortunate?

3251
02:27:09,680 --> 02:27:13,000
That was that NCsoft makes a lot of... I hope they have good insurance, like legal

3252
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:19,000
insurance or something because they make a lot of MMOs and hopefully this won't hit them

3253
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:23,560
in the pockets really hard because they've got a lot of stuff under development at NCsoft

3254
02:27:23,560 --> 02:27:24,560
right now.

3255
02:27:24,560 --> 02:27:27,280
This is going to suck that they're going to have to pay this guy out $28 million because

3256
02:27:27,280 --> 02:27:33,160
they screwed up some things.

3257
02:27:33,160 --> 02:27:34,960
Tabula Rasa was an interesting game.

3258
02:27:34,960 --> 02:27:36,040
It's kind of a bummer.

3259
02:27:36,040 --> 02:27:37,320
It got kind of a crappy break.

3260
02:27:37,320 --> 02:27:38,320
I don't know.

3261
02:27:38,320 --> 02:27:40,640
It shouldn't... Maybe they just didn't promote it well enough.

3262
02:27:40,640 --> 02:27:41,640
I don't know.

3263
02:27:41,640 --> 02:27:43,960
Nothing was able to beat WoW at that time.

3264
02:27:43,960 --> 02:27:44,960
I don't know.

3265
02:27:44,960 --> 02:27:46,600
But, there it is.

3266
02:27:46,600 --> 02:27:47,600
All right.

3267
02:27:47,600 --> 02:27:52,800
We are going to go ahead and open up the Skype line if you want to give us a call at 1-877-GAME-OLR

3268
02:27:52,800 --> 02:27:55,720
or our username on Skype is ORANGELOUNGERADIO.

3269
02:27:55,720 --> 02:27:59,680
Go ahead and give us a call and we'll take a few calls before we end the show, close

3270
02:27:59,680 --> 02:28:05,080
up shop tonight, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username is ORANGELOUNGERADIO.

3271
02:28:05,080 --> 02:28:10,880
I was hoping Loki would call us but I guess his Wi-Fi at the hospital is not so great.

3272
02:28:10,880 --> 02:28:14,160
He's not getting the private messages but that's okay.

3273
02:28:14,160 --> 02:28:16,640
He's got better things to do than talk to us, honestly.

3274
02:28:16,640 --> 02:28:20,360
I know we're his friends and everything but he's got more important stuff tonight.

3275
02:28:20,360 --> 02:28:21,560
It's all good.

3276
02:28:21,560 --> 02:28:24,360
It's all good.

3277
02:28:24,360 --> 02:28:27,360
We should try to take the mics on the road and go see the baby.

3278
02:28:27,360 --> 02:28:28,360
That would be fun.

3279
02:28:28,360 --> 02:28:29,360
That would be absolutely cute.

3280
02:28:29,360 --> 02:28:33,000
At the same time, everybody probably wants to be left the fuck alone right now.

3281
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:38,320
Keep in mind, for the next month, all this baby is going to be able to see is blur, blur,

3282
02:28:38,320 --> 02:28:39,320
blur.

3283
02:28:39,320 --> 02:28:40,480
Ooh, red.

3284
02:28:40,480 --> 02:28:41,480
But you like blur.

3285
02:28:41,480 --> 02:28:42,480
They're a great band.

3286
02:28:42,480 --> 02:28:43,480
Yeah.

3287
02:28:43,480 --> 02:28:44,480
Dork.

3288
02:28:44,480 --> 02:28:45,480
We got a phone call.

3289
02:28:45,480 --> 02:28:46,480
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

3290
02:28:46,480 --> 02:28:47,480
Who's this?

3291
02:28:47,480 --> 02:28:49,760
Hey, it's Rama back from Otacon 2010.

3292
02:28:49,760 --> 02:28:50,760
Hey, Rama.

3293
02:28:50,760 --> 02:28:51,760
What's up?

3294
02:28:51,760 --> 02:28:52,760
Sup.

3295
02:28:52,760 --> 02:28:53,760
How you doing?

3296
02:28:53,760 --> 02:28:54,760
Hey.

3297
02:28:54,760 --> 02:28:55,760
I'm doing good.

3298
02:28:55,760 --> 02:28:58,960
I'm a little tired but, eh, it's a con.

3299
02:28:58,960 --> 02:28:59,960
What do you expect?

3300
02:28:59,960 --> 02:29:02,480
You didn't get confunk, did you?

3301
02:29:02,480 --> 02:29:03,480
Cons are always exhausting.

3302
02:29:03,480 --> 02:29:04,480
No, wait, wait.

3303
02:29:04,480 --> 02:29:07,920
Just so you know, the term confunk is officially dead.

3304
02:29:07,920 --> 02:29:10,520
It's been replaced with hobo.

3305
02:29:10,520 --> 02:29:11,520
What?

3306
02:29:11,520 --> 02:29:12,520
What?

3307
02:29:12,520 --> 02:29:13,520
Okay.

3308
02:29:13,520 --> 02:29:15,520
Haven't heard that before.

3309
02:29:15,520 --> 02:29:16,520
Hobo.

3310
02:29:16,520 --> 02:29:18,400
Horrific otaku body odor.

3311
02:29:18,400 --> 02:29:19,400
Hobo.

3312
02:29:19,400 --> 02:29:20,400
Oh, god.

3313
02:29:20,400 --> 02:29:21,400
No, no, no, no, no, no.

3314
02:29:21,400 --> 02:29:22,680
A similar thing happens at game conventions, too.

3315
02:29:22,680 --> 02:29:23,680
No, no, no.

3316
02:29:23,680 --> 02:29:28,280
Confunk, but keep in mind, confunk also, though, encompasses con disease.

3317
02:29:28,280 --> 02:29:29,280
Ooh.

3318
02:29:29,280 --> 02:29:30,280
Well, that's just...

3319
02:29:30,280 --> 02:29:31,280
Well, that's...

3320
02:29:31,280 --> 02:29:32,280
Which was coined here in California...

3321
02:29:32,280 --> 02:29:33,280
Well, that's just...

3322
02:29:33,280 --> 02:29:34,280
Which was coined here in California...

3323
02:29:34,280 --> 02:29:35,280
...to replace the con in your pocket.

3324
02:29:35,280 --> 02:29:38,400
...to replace the con in California as the Dorbola.

3325
02:29:38,400 --> 02:29:41,640
Because remember, we can track it back to Doreen.

3326
02:29:41,640 --> 02:29:42,640
I remember that, yes.

3327
02:29:42,640 --> 02:29:43,640
Anyway...

3328
02:29:43,640 --> 02:29:44,640
We got married!

3329
02:29:44,640 --> 02:29:45,640
I know, I know.

3330
02:29:45,640 --> 02:29:46,640
She and Simon got married.

3331
02:29:46,640 --> 02:29:48,720
How was the con, Rama?

3332
02:29:48,720 --> 02:29:53,480
It was good, despite some of the couple of things that happened this weekend.

3333
02:29:53,480 --> 02:29:58,480
I had fun, my staff had fun, and I saw an ITG3 machine there.

3334
02:29:58,480 --> 02:29:59,480
What?

3335
02:29:59,480 --> 02:30:00,480
Wait, wait, wait.

3336
02:30:00,480 --> 02:30:01,880
They made an in-the-groove 3?

3337
02:30:01,880 --> 02:30:02,880
What?

3338
02:30:02,880 --> 02:30:04,100
There was an in-the-groove 3 machine there.

3339
02:30:04,100 --> 02:30:07,920
It wasn't on, so I don't know what was on it.

3340
02:30:07,920 --> 02:30:10,800
My game reporter, I'll have to ask her what was on the machine.

3341
02:30:10,800 --> 02:30:13,760
Didn't they get, like, sued to all hell?

3342
02:30:13,760 --> 02:30:15,840
And they can't make any more?

3343
02:30:15,840 --> 02:30:18,720
Was there a third mix officially?

3344
02:30:18,720 --> 02:30:19,840
I don't know.

3345
02:30:19,840 --> 02:30:24,640
I think it was in process before it got shut down, so, you know, maybe someone snuck it

3346
02:30:24,640 --> 02:30:26,360
out and threw it onto a machine or something.

3347
02:30:26,360 --> 02:30:29,040
I do have a picture of the unit, though.

3348
02:30:29,040 --> 02:30:30,840
A purposefully leaked prototype.

3349
02:30:30,840 --> 02:30:31,840
You said unit.

3350
02:30:31,840 --> 02:30:35,560
His son in chat says ITG3 is a mod of ITG2.

3351
02:30:35,560 --> 02:30:37,280
That wouldn't surprise me either, actually.

3352
02:30:37,280 --> 02:30:38,280
That makes sense.

3353
02:30:38,280 --> 02:30:40,880
Yeah, and oddly enough, there was no DDR machines there.

3354
02:30:40,880 --> 02:30:45,720
It was just that one ITG machine and two pump-it-up Pro2 machines.

3355
02:30:45,720 --> 02:30:46,720
Interesting.

3356
02:30:46,720 --> 02:30:48,720
Yeah, very.

3357
02:30:48,720 --> 02:30:50,200
What else in the gaming world?

3358
02:30:50,200 --> 02:30:55,280
Well, I didn't cover too much of the gaming because I was more covering it than I could

3359
02:30:55,280 --> 02:30:57,820
tell you about gaming cosplays.

3360
02:30:57,820 --> 02:30:59,440
I can tell you this much.

3361
02:30:59,440 --> 02:31:05,280
Every year when a Final Fantasy game comes out, everybody and their mother does cosplays,

3362
02:31:05,280 --> 02:31:09,880
and for the longest time, the big cosplay was always Final Fantasy VII.

3363
02:31:09,880 --> 02:31:10,880
I can tell you this right now.

3364
02:31:10,880 --> 02:31:18,520
There was about 12 to 13 Final Fantasy cosplayers, 6 to 7 of them were from XIII.

3365
02:31:18,520 --> 02:31:19,520
Wow.

3366
02:31:19,520 --> 02:31:23,220
Well, XIII's very cosplayable.

3367
02:31:23,220 --> 02:31:24,220
You know what I mean?

3368
02:31:24,220 --> 02:31:27,440
It is, but I don't think it really went over well with a lot of the fans, because from

3369
02:31:27,440 --> 02:31:31,480
when I talk to a lot of people, at first they love XIII, they're like, what the shit is

3370
02:31:31,480 --> 02:31:32,480
this?

3371
02:31:32,480 --> 02:31:33,480
Eh.

3372
02:31:33,480 --> 02:31:34,480
Hmm.

3373
02:31:34,480 --> 02:31:35,480
Eh.

3374
02:31:35,480 --> 02:31:40,120
I don't know, I still like XIII, I don't know what y'all's problem is, but whatever.

3375
02:31:40,120 --> 02:31:43,160
I enjoy XIII too, you know.

3376
02:31:43,160 --> 02:31:45,600
The battle system just kinda threw me.

3377
02:31:45,600 --> 02:31:47,440
That's probably what it is.

3378
02:31:47,440 --> 02:31:48,440
Gotcha.

3379
02:31:48,440 --> 02:31:50,960
Someone was supposed to lend me their copy.

3380
02:31:50,960 --> 02:31:53,360
I keep forgetting, I'm sorry.

3381
02:31:53,360 --> 02:31:57,600
You have to text me right before a show one night when I'm not in the bay.

3382
02:31:57,600 --> 02:32:01,120
Let's see, what else do I want to ask you about the con?

3383
02:32:01,120 --> 02:32:05,640
Well quickly, any really cool events, even anime style or whatever, what were some memorable

3384
02:32:05,640 --> 02:32:07,360
moments of the con?

3385
02:32:07,360 --> 02:32:14,640
Okay, my best memorable moment was the concert I went to this afternoon.

3386
02:32:14,640 --> 02:32:19,020
It was a Japanese hip-hop group called Homemade Kazoku.

3387
02:32:19,020 --> 02:32:24,600
The best way I could describe them is, if you remember hip-hop rap music from the 80s

3388
02:32:24,600 --> 02:32:29,880
when it was good, that'd take it to the next level.

3389
02:32:29,880 --> 02:32:30,880
I see.

3390
02:32:30,880 --> 02:32:31,880
Okay.

3391
02:32:31,880 --> 02:32:33,960
Are they as good as Dragon Ash?

3392
02:32:33,960 --> 02:32:36,960
Honestly, I think they're better than Dragon Ash.

3393
02:32:36,960 --> 02:32:37,960
Really?

3394
02:32:37,960 --> 02:32:38,960
Oh, snap.

3395
02:32:38,960 --> 02:32:42,440
And generally when a lot of Japanese artists come over, you know, they always have a little

3396
02:32:42,440 --> 02:32:50,840
bit of trouble speaking English to the fans, they were speaking in pure, 100% English.

3397
02:32:50,840 --> 02:32:55,720
No stuttering, no rough edges, it was just straight, clearly right across the board.

3398
02:32:55,720 --> 02:33:02,640
I've been to a lot of J-Rock, J-Pop concerts at Otakano, the conventions.

3399
02:33:02,640 --> 02:33:06,200
At this concert, everybody was on their feet going nuts.

3400
02:33:06,200 --> 02:33:10,120
I've never seen a crowd this wild.

3401
02:33:10,120 --> 02:33:11,120
Awesome.

3402
02:33:11,120 --> 02:33:14,200
Well, Rama, we got to wrap up so we can get more calls.

3403
02:33:14,200 --> 02:33:16,720
Do you have anything else you want to say about the con?

3404
02:33:16,720 --> 02:33:19,560
There was a fire at the convention center.

3405
02:33:19,560 --> 02:33:20,560
What?

3406
02:33:20,560 --> 02:33:21,560
Yes.

3407
02:33:21,560 --> 02:33:23,560
Did somebody say fire?

3408
02:33:23,560 --> 02:33:25,560
Oh, no.

3409
02:33:25,560 --> 02:33:44,240
So what'd you set on fire, Rama?

3410
02:33:44,240 --> 02:33:45,240
Rob?

3411
02:33:45,240 --> 02:33:46,240
What?

3412
02:33:46,240 --> 02:33:47,240
You're a dick.

3413
02:33:47,240 --> 02:33:48,240
You know what?

3414
02:33:48,240 --> 02:33:49,240
I know.

3415
02:33:49,240 --> 02:33:58,000
Okay, like, not everybody gets that joke, Rama.

3416
02:33:58,000 --> 02:34:00,840
All right, well, tell us about the fire real quick.

3417
02:34:00,840 --> 02:34:06,160
I was over in the Hilton doing a press conference with H&E Hotel, a Japanese fashion designer.

3418
02:34:06,160 --> 02:34:11,380
I found out from my staffers that a grease fire broke out in the concession stand, which

3419
02:34:11,380 --> 02:34:16,720
is downstairs, where the dealer's room is, they had to evacuate the entire convention

3420
02:34:16,720 --> 02:34:17,720
center.

3421
02:34:17,720 --> 02:34:18,720
What a con-runner.

3422
02:34:18,720 --> 02:34:23,200
At least it wasn't snowing outside.

3423
02:34:23,200 --> 02:34:27,520
And talking to some people, I kind of figured out who started the grease fire, and I think

3424
02:34:27,520 --> 02:34:32,920
only me and Jamie will catch this joke as I post a link to the complex in the chat room.

3425
02:34:32,920 --> 02:34:33,920
I did.

3426
02:34:33,920 --> 02:34:34,920
I did.

3427
02:34:34,920 --> 02:34:35,920
I did.

3428
02:34:35,920 --> 02:34:36,920
I like what Amaze Satsuma says in our chat room.

3429
02:34:36,920 --> 02:34:37,920
Con's on fire.

3430
02:34:37,920 --> 02:34:38,920
Nice.

3431
02:34:38,920 --> 02:34:39,920
I like that.

3432
02:34:39,920 --> 02:34:44,120
I can be the theme song for when your con gets set on fire.

3433
02:34:44,120 --> 02:34:45,480
All right.

3434
02:34:45,480 --> 02:34:46,480
That's it.

3435
02:34:46,480 --> 02:34:49,200
We're going to bring up on you now so we can take more calls, but have a good night.

3436
02:34:49,200 --> 02:34:50,200
Good night.

3437
02:34:50,200 --> 02:34:51,200
Bye.

3438
02:34:51,200 --> 02:34:52,200
All right.

3439
02:34:52,200 --> 02:34:53,200
Dude, fuck GameStop.

3440
02:34:53,200 --> 02:34:56,520
We're going to take another call real quick, and then I want to know more about why you're

3441
02:34:56,520 --> 02:34:57,520
angry.

3442
02:34:57,520 --> 02:34:58,520
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

3443
02:34:58,520 --> 02:34:59,520
Who's this?

3444
02:34:59,520 --> 02:35:00,520
This is Kane IM.

3445
02:35:00,520 --> 02:35:01,520
I'm sorry, what was that?

3446
02:35:01,520 --> 02:35:02,520
It's Kane IM.

3447
02:35:02,520 --> 02:35:03,520
This is Kane IM.

3448
02:35:03,520 --> 02:35:04,520
Kane IM.

3449
02:35:04,520 --> 02:35:05,520
You're a female.

3450
02:35:05,520 --> 02:35:06,520
I got it.

3451
02:35:06,520 --> 02:35:07,520
What's up, Kane IM?

3452
02:35:07,520 --> 02:35:08,520
Not much.

3453
02:35:08,520 --> 02:35:18,600
Actually, I did find a way to run the live show off my phone, so I do appreciate your

3454
02:35:18,600 --> 02:35:19,600
guys' help.

3455
02:35:19,600 --> 02:35:22,120
Oh, he's the same guy who emailed in about getting the...

3456
02:35:22,120 --> 02:35:23,120
Yeah.

3457
02:35:23,120 --> 02:35:24,120
Okay.

3458
02:35:24,120 --> 02:35:25,120
What did you end up using?

3459
02:35:25,120 --> 02:35:28,520
It was a shoutcast program.

3460
02:35:28,520 --> 02:35:33,720
I did a little bit of searching online.

3461
02:35:33,720 --> 02:35:34,720
I'm glad you were able to find something.

3462
02:35:34,720 --> 02:35:42,440
I wanted to know if you guys had any suggestions on how to get an IRC program for my phone.

3463
02:35:42,440 --> 02:35:44,560
An IRC program for your phone.

3464
02:35:44,560 --> 02:35:48,000
So that I could join in on the chat.

3465
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:50,440
I know that there is one for iPhone.

3466
02:35:50,440 --> 02:35:51,600
I don't know about the joint.

3467
02:35:51,600 --> 02:35:55,860
I hate to say iPhone again, but again, that All Games app, whenever it comes back, because

3468
02:35:55,860 --> 02:35:58,360
I imagine its disappearance is only temporary, you can get an IRC.

3469
02:35:58,360 --> 02:35:59,680
The joint has a browser, right?

3470
02:35:59,680 --> 02:36:00,680
Do you have a PSP?

3471
02:36:00,680 --> 02:36:01,680
Yes.

3472
02:36:01,680 --> 02:36:02,680
Okay.

3473
02:36:02,680 --> 02:36:03,680
If you have a PSP...

3474
02:36:03,680 --> 02:36:04,680
Yeah.

3475
02:36:04,680 --> 02:36:09,400
If you have a PSP.com, then you can do the chat and the stream all from the PSP.

3476
02:36:09,400 --> 02:36:10,400
Oh, no, wait.

3477
02:36:10,400 --> 02:36:14,720
Unfortunately, I'm a truck driver, and Wi-Fi is kind of scarce.

3478
02:36:14,720 --> 02:36:15,720
Oh, and you know what?

3479
02:36:15,720 --> 02:36:18,840
I lied anyway, because the chat room on the PSP is totally separate.

3480
02:36:18,840 --> 02:36:19,840
It's a junk.

3481
02:36:19,840 --> 02:36:21,280
It's all filled with spammers, too.

3482
02:36:21,280 --> 02:36:22,280
It's junk.

3483
02:36:22,280 --> 02:36:24,280
It used to be awesome.

3484
02:36:24,280 --> 02:36:25,280
Oh, hard.

3485
02:36:25,280 --> 02:36:31,920
Gosh, I'm trying to think of IRC that you could do on a Black Bear, or no, you have

3486
02:36:31,920 --> 02:36:32,920
an M-Droid, right?

3487
02:36:32,920 --> 02:36:33,920
Yes.

3488
02:36:33,920 --> 02:36:34,920
Yeah.

3489
02:36:34,920 --> 02:36:38,080
I'm not sure.

3490
02:36:38,080 --> 02:36:41,920
I'm opening up to our own chatters right now to see if they have any suggestions at

3491
02:36:41,920 --> 02:36:44,560
chat.orangelandraday.com.

3492
02:36:44,560 --> 02:36:50,920
I guess just try to search for something IRC, because with any IRC client, you should be

3493
02:36:50,920 --> 02:36:55,900
able to connect to the Game Surge Network, which is the network we're on, and then it's

3494
02:36:55,900 --> 02:36:58,520
just channel Orange Lounge.

3495
02:36:58,520 --> 02:37:01,440
Any IRC client can get to our room.

3496
02:37:01,440 --> 02:37:03,960
We use, here in studio, we use M-I-R-C.

3497
02:37:03,960 --> 02:37:08,040
So yeah, and this toy guy in our chat says, IRC is IRC is IRC, right?

3498
02:37:08,040 --> 02:37:09,040
And yes, that's correct.

3499
02:37:09,040 --> 02:37:10,040
Yeah.

3500
02:37:10,040 --> 02:37:14,880
So unfortunately, I don't know what IRC clients exist on that platform, but you have to run

3501
02:37:14,880 --> 02:37:17,640
a search and maybe Google can tell you.

3502
02:37:17,640 --> 02:37:19,120
All right, thanks.

3503
02:37:19,120 --> 02:37:23,480
All right, well, good luck to you, and well, hey, any games that you've been playing while

3504
02:37:23,480 --> 02:37:26,480
you've been out on the road?

3505
02:37:26,480 --> 02:37:32,120
I just got Naughty Bear, and my one sinful pleasure is Harvest Moon.

3506
02:37:32,120 --> 02:37:33,120
How do you like Naughty Bear?

3507
02:37:33,120 --> 02:37:34,680
Because I really want to play it.

3508
02:37:34,680 --> 02:37:38,280
I would picture manhunt with teddy bears.

3509
02:37:38,280 --> 02:37:40,220
That's about all it is.

3510
02:37:40,220 --> 02:37:41,220
Now see, it's-

3511
02:37:41,220 --> 02:37:42,220
It's good for a giggle.

3512
02:37:42,220 --> 02:37:43,220
Here's the thing, though.

3513
02:37:43,220 --> 02:37:46,600
It sounds awesome, and I remember when we were looking at the previews here in studio,

3514
02:37:46,600 --> 02:37:51,400
we were so excited and everything else, but I've heard the game is real shit.

3515
02:37:51,400 --> 02:37:56,180
Like it's getting terrible reviews, so I'm kind of, you know, not the reviewers necessarily

3516
02:37:56,180 --> 02:37:59,440
know everything, but it did kind of give me pause.

3517
02:37:59,440 --> 02:38:03,760
I was like, wow, this game is doing really bad in the reviews.

3518
02:38:03,760 --> 02:38:04,760
Can you see that?

3519
02:38:04,760 --> 02:38:05,760
Why that's happening?

3520
02:38:05,760 --> 02:38:07,160
Or do you think it's totally unfounded?

3521
02:38:07,160 --> 02:38:14,400
The controls are a bit clunky, the camera doesn't seem to want to want to cooperate

3522
02:38:14,400 --> 02:38:15,400
with you.

3523
02:38:15,400 --> 02:38:22,360
I mean, I would wait if you really want to play it until either someone else plays it,

3524
02:38:22,360 --> 02:38:25,120
or we play it bargain based.

3525
02:38:25,120 --> 02:38:27,720
I can, maybe I'll do that bargain basement then.

3526
02:38:27,720 --> 02:38:30,680
All right, it's too bad they can't get some of those basic things right.

3527
02:38:30,680 --> 02:38:32,360
It's like they don't even play the game or something.

3528
02:38:32,360 --> 02:38:33,360
I don't know.

3529
02:38:33,360 --> 02:38:36,000
Well then, in about, you know, a couple of months I might just pick it up.

3530
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:38,840
Oh yeah, I thought you were an Xbox owner.

3531
02:38:38,840 --> 02:38:40,000
It's only on 3-

3532
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:43,720
That doesn't mean I can't go over to somebody's house and play.

3533
02:38:43,720 --> 02:38:45,520
That's usually where I get all my gaming experiences.

3534
02:38:45,520 --> 02:38:49,960
I usually have some- I know a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy who owns a 360.

3535
02:38:49,960 --> 02:38:50,960
There you go.

3536
02:38:50,960 --> 02:38:51,960
There you go.

3537
02:38:51,960 --> 02:38:55,520
All right, well K9M, we're going to let you get back to your thing, but thanks so much

3538
02:38:55,520 --> 02:38:56,520
for the call.

3539
02:38:56,520 --> 02:38:58,040
And good luck with the mobile phone quest.

3540
02:38:58,040 --> 02:38:59,040
We appreciate you trying so hard.

3541
02:38:59,040 --> 02:39:00,040
All right, no problem.

3542
02:39:00,040 --> 02:39:04,240
You guys try and keep, you know, doing what you're doing and take it easy.

3543
02:39:04,240 --> 02:39:05,320
Well thank you very much.

3544
02:39:05,320 --> 02:39:06,320
Keep on trucking.

3545
02:39:06,320 --> 02:39:07,320
All right.

3546
02:39:07,320 --> 02:39:08,320
Bye.

3547
02:39:08,320 --> 02:39:09,800
I've always wanted to say that to a truck driver.

3548
02:39:09,800 --> 02:39:10,800
All right.

3549
02:39:10,800 --> 02:39:16,180
All right, anyhow, let's see, I'm looking at chat and some folks clarifying some things

3550
02:39:16,180 --> 02:39:21,800
about the OLR PSP and Hitstun is saying, OLR PSP's chat is a shout box, not an IRC chat.

3551
02:39:21,800 --> 02:39:22,800
And that is correct.

3552
02:39:22,800 --> 02:39:25,920
There is no IRC clients that work on PSP right now.

3553
02:39:25,920 --> 02:39:30,020
Loki tried to get that to happen and he couldn't, because you're absolutely right.

3554
02:39:30,020 --> 02:39:31,560
There's nothing that works right now.

3555
02:39:31,560 --> 02:39:32,560
So there it is.

3556
02:39:32,560 --> 02:39:34,240
Oh, we can do at least one more call.

3557
02:39:34,240 --> 02:39:35,240
Hi, you're on Orange Orange Radio.

3558
02:39:35,240 --> 02:39:36,240
Who's this?

3559
02:39:36,240 --> 02:39:37,240
Yeah, hello there.

3560
02:39:37,240 --> 02:39:38,240
Yo, hello.

3561
02:39:38,240 --> 02:39:39,240
Hello.

3562
02:39:39,240 --> 02:39:40,240
How are you doing?

3563
02:39:40,240 --> 02:39:41,240
Who's this?

3564
02:39:41,240 --> 02:39:43,800
This is that one, Aki Ripper from Sweden.

3565
02:39:43,800 --> 02:39:44,800
Aki Ripper.

3566
02:39:44,800 --> 02:39:46,080
From PlayStarts F2.

3567
02:39:46,080 --> 02:39:47,080
From Sweden.

3568
02:39:47,080 --> 02:39:48,080
It's the other Swede.

3569
02:39:48,080 --> 02:39:49,560
It's another Battle of the Swedes night.

3570
02:39:49,560 --> 02:39:50,560
I love it.

3571
02:39:50,560 --> 02:39:51,560
We had our emailer.

3572
02:39:51,560 --> 02:39:52,560
Aki Ripper.

3573
02:39:52,560 --> 02:39:55,960
No, there's always room for at least two Swedish people.

3574
02:39:55,960 --> 02:39:56,960
You know what?

3575
02:39:56,960 --> 02:40:00,040
If a third Swedish person wanted to listen, I would welcome them too.

3576
02:40:00,040 --> 02:40:01,040
What is on your mind?

3577
02:40:01,040 --> 02:40:02,040
Well, I will...

3578
02:40:02,040 --> 02:40:04,360
And if there were four, we could make our own version of Abba.

3579
02:40:04,360 --> 02:40:06,600
All right, Aki Ripper, what's on your mind?

3580
02:40:06,600 --> 02:40:07,600
Yo.

3581
02:40:07,600 --> 02:40:09,600
What the funk.

3582
02:40:09,600 --> 02:40:10,800
Damn it.

3583
02:40:10,800 --> 02:40:11,800
What's on your mind?

3584
02:40:11,800 --> 02:40:12,800
Hello?

3585
02:40:12,800 --> 02:40:13,800
Yeah.

3586
02:40:13,800 --> 02:40:14,800
Hello?

3587
02:40:14,800 --> 02:40:15,800
What's on your mind?

3588
02:40:15,800 --> 02:40:24,240
Well, I ramble on the network one time and, well, Star Wars 2 could be wonderful if I could

3589
02:40:24,240 --> 02:40:25,240
play it.

3590
02:40:25,240 --> 02:40:26,240
Oh, no.

3591
02:40:26,240 --> 02:40:27,240
What's going on?

3592
02:40:27,240 --> 02:40:28,240
Did they lock Sweden out?

3593
02:40:28,240 --> 02:40:29,240
No, no.

3594
02:40:29,240 --> 02:40:36,560
The thing is that I can't play it due to the thing that Battle of the Swedes refused to

3595
02:40:36,560 --> 02:40:42,360
accept that I have tapped in my key in Battle of the Swedes and said it's listed.

3596
02:40:42,360 --> 02:40:48,200
But when I launch a game and say like, no, you do not have a stock FT associated with

3597
02:40:48,200 --> 02:40:50,600
your Battle of the account.

3598
02:40:50,600 --> 02:40:58,200
Like it's all listed there, but the game refuses to say no, yes, or something.

3599
02:40:58,200 --> 02:41:00,520
We have an angry, angry Swede on the show tonight.

3600
02:41:00,520 --> 02:41:02,600
You hear that anger in his voice.

3601
02:41:02,600 --> 02:41:03,600
I don't...

3602
02:41:03,600 --> 02:41:12,160
I'm quite pissed in that regard since, well, I, well, around, well, 900 Swedish crowns

3603
02:41:12,160 --> 02:41:18,280
and that, which is like, I'm going to be a rough, how much, by the way, is the collector's

3604
02:41:18,280 --> 02:41:21,440
edition in, anyway, it's the collector's edition.

3605
02:41:21,440 --> 02:41:22,440
$99.

3606
02:41:22,440 --> 02:41:28,680
How much, how much you pay it, pay it in, and they can do it out, but it's somewhere

3607
02:41:28,680 --> 02:41:36,840
around, well, somewhere around 90 bucks or even less.

3608
02:41:36,840 --> 02:41:37,840
Wow.

3609
02:41:37,840 --> 02:41:41,800
Well, here's, here's a suggestion, I don't even know if this works, you probably already

3610
02:41:41,800 --> 02:41:42,800
done this.

3611
02:41:42,800 --> 02:41:46,760
Have you logged onto the web portal, going onto battle.net on the web and making sure

3612
02:41:46,760 --> 02:41:48,760
that the game is associated there?

3613
02:41:48,760 --> 02:41:52,920
Yeah, well there, it's listed there.

3614
02:41:52,920 --> 02:42:01,760
And well, the thing is that, well, I've, and here's the other thing though, the, the work

3615
02:42:01,760 --> 02:42:05,040
around that I'm trying to do is, well, change password.

3616
02:42:05,040 --> 02:42:12,600
If it weren't for the following fact that I had forgotten my like hidden question, hidden,

3617
02:42:12,600 --> 02:42:15,120
that's my, that's my problem, that's my problem.

3618
02:42:15,120 --> 02:42:24,520
So and I've, and well, I've tried for, tried to, for, tried calling the, calling Blizzard

3619
02:42:24,520 --> 02:42:28,880
about it, but here's the other thing though, trying to call the Blizzard line around these

3620
02:42:28,880 --> 02:42:31,180
parts, around these seems quite hard.

3621
02:42:31,180 --> 02:42:37,600
And the irony is that I've managed to, managed to call the US one when I had problems with

3622
02:42:37,600 --> 02:42:43,680
the, you know, when I had problems with my, at the time when I was playing World of Warcraft

3623
02:42:43,680 --> 02:42:47,760
on US, on US servers, then I got straight along.

3624
02:42:47,760 --> 02:42:52,280
And now it's like, yeah, you're out of luck or something.

3625
02:42:52,280 --> 02:42:53,400
Oh, well anyway.

3626
02:42:53,400 --> 02:42:56,740
Has your WoW account been inactive for some time?

3627
02:42:56,740 --> 02:43:05,040
My WoW account, my, both of my WoW accounts have been inactive for like a one of a year.

3628
02:43:05,040 --> 02:43:07,360
Did you have an authenticator on that account?

3629
02:43:07,360 --> 02:43:15,240
No, I did not because I, because the authenticator, when I played the, the authenticator wasn't

3630
02:43:15,240 --> 02:43:16,240
released yet.

3631
02:43:16,240 --> 02:43:21,460
It is possible, and I don't know, but it's possible that your account got hacked because

3632
02:43:21,460 --> 02:43:25,800
I have heard of people that even though they had inactive Warcraft accounts, that some

3633
02:43:25,800 --> 02:43:30,400
people would go in there and like reactivate them to get access to the characters.

3634
02:43:30,400 --> 02:43:32,720
It's crazy, crazy stuff.

3635
02:43:32,720 --> 02:43:36,080
Just hypothesizing that that could be what's screwing with you over there.

3636
02:43:36,080 --> 02:43:42,480
So definitely, uh, you're going to have to keep on Blizzard and, and I guess, well, I

3637
02:43:42,480 --> 02:43:49,680
will have to call them or, or in something because, well, uh, but, but, but my, one of

3638
02:43:49,680 --> 02:43:55,960
the problems that I have also is that, well, if I remember right, to be able to identify,

3639
02:43:55,960 --> 02:44:02,880
well, I'm have to go find, the problem is also is that I need to find like a scanner

3640
02:44:02,880 --> 02:44:13,720
or a scanner because I need to scan in my passport or something, uh, to send a, well,

3641
02:44:13,720 --> 02:44:20,800
to a basic way, like maybe in a file and send it to them and say that, yes, this is me of

3642
02:44:20,800 --> 02:44:21,800
sorts.

3643
02:44:21,800 --> 02:44:22,800
What a pain.

3644
02:44:22,800 --> 02:44:24,880
Or are you just going to have to give them the angry Swede?

3645
02:44:24,880 --> 02:44:27,640
Sounds like this angry Swede is quite justified in his anger.

3646
02:44:27,640 --> 02:44:28,640
Yes.

3647
02:44:28,640 --> 02:44:29,640
I, I, I wish you the best.

3648
02:44:29,640 --> 02:44:31,360
I wish there was a magic wand.

3649
02:44:31,360 --> 02:44:39,440
In that regard, I am quite pissed and also because, well, and also because, well, uh,

3650
02:44:39,440 --> 02:44:44,240
Starcraft 2, and here's the other thing though, in a kind of way, I already know what happens

3651
02:44:44,240 --> 02:44:50,400
in, because also the thing is, so, uh, playing Starcraft, I wasn't that hyped for Starcraft

3652
02:44:50,400 --> 02:44:56,640
2 in a kind of way anyway, since, uh, the thing that I did is that since I got the collector's

3653
02:44:56,640 --> 02:45:02,540
edition, you have this like special DVD of sorts when you get all the, uh, the, uh, video

3654
02:45:02,540 --> 02:45:06,240
frequencies from the game and I'm like, yeah, let's watch this.

3655
02:45:06,240 --> 02:45:09,880
So yeah, you just got spoiled the whole game.

3656
02:45:09,880 --> 02:45:19,120
Well, here's the other thing though, uh, and even more fun is that, well, if I, and especially

3657
02:45:19,120 --> 02:45:22,560
actually in a kind of way, since I'm like one of those players that played through the

3658
02:45:22,560 --> 02:45:31,720
first Starcraft game, we're playing like code power overwhelming, yes, please.

3659
02:45:31,720 --> 02:45:34,080
Which was that, well, god mode activated.

3660
02:45:34,080 --> 02:45:35,280
Oh well.

3661
02:45:35,280 --> 02:45:36,280
Okay.

3662
02:45:36,280 --> 02:45:37,280
Ripper.

3663
02:45:37,280 --> 02:45:39,720
I wish I could fix it for you, but it sounds like you're just going to have to keep on

3664
02:45:39,720 --> 02:45:42,120
Blizzard customer support, but do let us know what happens.

3665
02:45:42,120 --> 02:45:43,120
Okay, buddy.

3666
02:45:43,120 --> 02:45:45,120
Yeah, well, I'll keep you updated.

3667
02:45:45,120 --> 02:45:46,120
All right.

3668
02:45:46,120 --> 02:45:47,120
I hope he can get to the zerging soon.

3669
02:45:47,120 --> 02:45:48,120
All right.

3670
02:45:48,120 --> 02:45:49,120
Hang in there.

3671
02:45:49,120 --> 02:45:50,120
Take care, buddy.

3672
02:45:50,120 --> 02:45:51,120
Bye.

3673
02:45:51,120 --> 02:45:52,120
All right.

3674
02:45:52,120 --> 02:45:53,120
Poor guy.

3675
02:45:53,120 --> 02:45:56,040
But Hey, tough lesson for everybody learned.

3676
02:45:56,040 --> 02:45:57,040
Learn it.

3677
02:45:57,040 --> 02:45:58,040
Okay.

3678
02:45:58,040 --> 02:45:59,040
Ripper's expense.

3679
02:45:59,040 --> 02:46:00,600
Learn at the expense of the Swedes.

3680
02:46:00,600 --> 02:46:04,800
Don't forget your security question because that sucks when that happens.

3681
02:46:04,800 --> 02:46:09,280
You got to be very careful with that stuff, so make sure you will be able to remember

3682
02:46:09,280 --> 02:46:13,320
it later on or else you're going to have all those problems that Aki Ripper was talking

3683
02:46:13,320 --> 02:46:14,320
about there.

3684
02:46:14,320 --> 02:46:15,320
All right.

3685
02:46:15,320 --> 02:46:17,840
Well, that is going to do it for Orange Laundria's phone calls tonight.

3686
02:46:17,840 --> 02:46:19,400
We're going to close up the Skypline.

3687
02:46:19,400 --> 02:46:20,400
I don't know.

3688
02:46:20,400 --> 02:46:22,600
Usually Loki is the collector of last minute stories.

3689
02:46:22,600 --> 02:46:24,760
I don't know if Dark Sakura pulled anything.

3690
02:46:24,760 --> 02:46:25,760
I did.

3691
02:46:25,760 --> 02:46:26,760
You did?

3692
02:46:26,760 --> 02:46:28,600
Well, Dark Sakura, what do you have for last minute stories tonight?

3693
02:46:28,600 --> 02:46:34,960
The Canadians are luring game developers out of Alabama.

3694
02:46:34,960 --> 02:46:39,360
I didn't realize there was like this whole avalanche of game developers in Alabama in

3695
02:46:39,360 --> 02:46:40,360
the first place.

3696
02:46:40,360 --> 02:46:48,040
Well, the province of Newfoundland and Labrador paid $300,000 to a Huntsville, Alabama video

3697
02:46:48,040 --> 02:46:52,600
game development company so it could set up a studio in Canada.

3698
02:46:52,600 --> 02:47:00,480
It's Bit Trap Studios Canada is doing a multiplayer online games and wants some help.

3699
02:47:00,480 --> 02:47:01,480
I see.

3700
02:47:01,480 --> 02:47:05,920
They're hoping that it will infuse $1.6 million into the local economy.

3701
02:47:05,920 --> 02:47:06,920
I see.

3702
02:47:06,920 --> 02:47:09,520
I knew those Canadians were up to no good.

3703
02:47:09,520 --> 02:47:11,920
It's an economic war that they're declaring.

3704
02:47:11,920 --> 02:47:12,920
I see.

3705
02:47:12,920 --> 02:47:18,280
But that was like jazz.

3706
02:47:18,280 --> 02:47:21,240
Time to start pouring your maple syrup down the sewers.

3707
02:47:21,240 --> 02:47:24,720
Like, dude, I'm from Alabama, so it was cool.

3708
02:47:24,720 --> 02:47:27,800
I'm just, obviously I'm teasing, come on.

3709
02:47:27,800 --> 02:47:29,760
We like our neighbors to the north really.

3710
02:47:29,760 --> 02:47:30,760
Usually.

3711
02:47:30,760 --> 02:47:31,760
Usually.

3712
02:47:31,760 --> 02:47:32,760
Most days.

3713
02:47:32,760 --> 02:47:33,760
Most days.

3714
02:47:33,760 --> 02:47:34,760
All right.

3715
02:47:34,760 --> 02:47:35,760
Anything else?

3716
02:47:35,760 --> 02:47:36,760
Was that it?

3717
02:47:36,760 --> 02:47:37,760
Nope.

3718
02:47:37,760 --> 02:47:38,760
All right.

3719
02:47:38,760 --> 02:47:39,760
No, that was not it or no, there's nothing else?

3720
02:47:39,760 --> 02:47:40,760
No, there's nothing else.

3721
02:47:40,760 --> 02:47:41,760
All right.

3722
02:47:41,760 --> 02:47:42,760
I'm being a jerk.

3723
02:47:42,760 --> 02:47:43,760
All right.

3724
02:47:43,760 --> 02:47:44,760
That's going to do it for Orange Laundry tonight.

3725
02:47:44,760 --> 02:47:48,640
It's about time for us to go around and wrap everything up and put the nail in the coffin

3726
02:47:48,640 --> 02:47:49,640
of the show.

3727
02:47:49,640 --> 02:47:52,560
We're going to go around and get everybody's final thought, but first I have to thank our

3728
02:47:52,560 --> 02:47:55,320
guests for being here tonight because they did great work.

3729
02:47:55,320 --> 02:47:56,960
Really did good work tonight.

3730
02:47:56,960 --> 02:47:57,960
Really appreciate it.

3731
02:47:57,960 --> 02:47:59,200
So, Gary, thank you so much for being here tonight.

3732
02:47:59,200 --> 02:48:00,200
You're welcome.

3733
02:48:00,200 --> 02:48:01,200
It was a pleasure.

3734
02:48:01,200 --> 02:48:02,200
Glad to be here.

3735
02:48:02,200 --> 02:48:04,560
I hope the show has inspired you to get up in console and PC gaming.

3736
02:48:04,560 --> 02:48:06,360
I saw you were doing the Dungeons and Dragons download.

3737
02:48:06,360 --> 02:48:09,720
Yeah, but I'm also thinking about what console I should buy, so.

3738
02:48:09,720 --> 02:48:10,720
Oh, tough decision.

3739
02:48:10,720 --> 02:48:11,720
Tough decision.

3740
02:48:11,720 --> 02:48:12,720
Yes, it is.

3741
02:48:12,720 --> 02:48:13,720
Let me help you after the show.

3742
02:48:13,720 --> 02:48:14,720
All right.

3743
02:48:14,720 --> 02:48:20,080
So, do come back and let us know what you end up getting and what PC games you do end

3744
02:48:20,080 --> 02:48:21,080
up getting into.

3745
02:48:21,080 --> 02:48:22,080
Oh, I'd love to come back.

3746
02:48:22,080 --> 02:48:23,080
All right.

3747
02:48:23,080 --> 02:48:24,080
Please do.

3748
02:48:24,080 --> 02:48:26,080
Also, Myla, thank you so much for being on the show tonight.

3749
02:48:26,080 --> 02:48:27,080
No problem.

3750
02:48:27,080 --> 02:48:28,080
Appreciate it.

3751
02:48:28,080 --> 02:48:32,080
And a shout out to my lovelies in the chat rooms who actually know who I am.

3752
02:48:32,080 --> 02:48:33,080
We love the chatters.

3753
02:48:33,080 --> 02:48:34,080
Appreciate them.

3754
02:48:34,080 --> 02:48:35,080
So, yeah.

3755
02:48:35,080 --> 02:48:36,080
Go RuneScape.

3756
02:48:36,080 --> 02:48:37,080
Okay.

3757
02:48:37,080 --> 02:48:38,080
I'm done.

3758
02:48:38,080 --> 02:48:39,880
And Myla, keep enjoying your 12-year-old game.

3759
02:48:39,880 --> 02:48:40,880
I know.

3760
02:48:40,880 --> 02:48:41,880
It's great.

3761
02:48:41,880 --> 02:48:42,880
I know.

3762
02:48:42,880 --> 02:48:43,880
No, no.

3763
02:48:43,880 --> 02:48:44,880
No gaming reports.

3764
02:48:44,880 --> 02:48:46,880
So, between you and Drunami, I think we'll be pretty covered.

3765
02:48:46,880 --> 02:48:47,880
So, come on back sometime.

3766
02:48:47,880 --> 02:48:48,880
Yup.

3767
02:48:48,880 --> 02:48:49,880
Yup.

3768
02:48:49,880 --> 02:48:50,880
Yup.

3769
02:48:50,880 --> 02:48:51,880
With this economy, you need it.

3770
02:48:51,880 --> 02:48:54,680
DarkSakura, I'm going to ask for your final thought tonight.

3771
02:48:54,680 --> 02:48:56,680
What is your final thought?

3772
02:48:56,680 --> 02:48:57,680
Ow.

3773
02:48:57,680 --> 02:48:59,360
Poor thing.

3774
02:48:59,360 --> 02:49:01,200
DarkSakura deserves our full sympathy.

3775
02:49:01,200 --> 02:49:02,200
It's been a rough week.

3776
02:49:02,200 --> 02:49:03,200
Sympathy.

3777
02:49:03,200 --> 02:49:04,200
I want a cookie.

3778
02:49:04,200 --> 02:49:05,200
You need a hug.

3779
02:49:05,200 --> 02:49:06,200
And a cookie.

3780
02:49:06,200 --> 02:49:07,200
And a cookie.

3781
02:49:07,200 --> 02:49:08,200
And a pony.

3782
02:49:08,200 --> 02:49:09,200
And a dinner.

3783
02:49:09,200 --> 02:49:10,200
I need to give our guests their final thought, too.

3784
02:49:10,200 --> 02:49:12,200
Gary, do you have a final thought tonight?

3785
02:49:12,200 --> 02:49:18,600
Um, it's been too long since I've done any console game or any computer game and I need

3786
02:49:18,600 --> 02:49:19,600
back into it.

3787
02:49:19,600 --> 02:49:24,040
It looks like things have taken quantum leaps from the last time I did this seriously.

3788
02:49:24,040 --> 02:49:27,840
I saw the screenshots of Arkham Asylum and was blown away, so.

3789
02:49:27,840 --> 02:49:29,400
I'm glad we could inspire you.

3790
02:49:29,400 --> 02:49:30,400
Yup.

3791
02:49:30,400 --> 02:49:32,120
Uh, Myla, do you have a final thought tonight?

3792
02:49:32,120 --> 02:49:33,120
DC Online.

3793
02:49:33,120 --> 02:49:34,120
Wow.

3794
02:49:34,120 --> 02:49:35,120
Oh yeah.

3795
02:49:35,120 --> 02:49:36,880
You're totally going to be there, too.

3796
02:49:36,880 --> 02:49:37,880
Can't wait.

3797
02:49:37,880 --> 02:49:42,320
Uh, and my final thought is, I think Pinkberry would make it all better.

3798
02:49:42,320 --> 02:49:43,320
Yeah.

3799
02:49:43,320 --> 02:49:44,320
I've never been there.

3800
02:49:44,320 --> 02:49:45,320
It's really good.

3801
02:49:45,320 --> 02:49:47,200
But sadly, it's Sunday and they're not going to be open.

3802
02:49:47,200 --> 02:49:48,200
But anyway, tomorrow.

3803
02:49:48,200 --> 02:49:49,200
Aw.

3804
02:49:49,200 --> 02:49:50,200
Alright, that's it, guys.

3805
02:49:50,200 --> 02:49:51,200
Have a wonderful week.

3806
02:49:51,200 --> 02:49:53,040
We will be back here next week to do it all over again.

3807
02:49:53,040 --> 02:49:55,320
Unfortunately, Loki's going to be out for a little while longer.

3808
02:49:55,320 --> 02:49:59,560
But hey, DarkSakura and I are perfectly capable of holding down the fort, so tune in next

3809
02:49:59,560 --> 02:50:02,520
week to see what the antics bring and- I got duct tape.

3810
02:50:02,520 --> 02:50:07,400
We're going to have a co-host next week to fill in for Loki, so more on that next week.

3811
02:50:07,400 --> 02:50:09,640
We'll see you next week here at Orange Lounge Radio.

3812
02:50:09,640 --> 02:50:11,680
Oh, I almost forgot.

3813
02:50:11,680 --> 02:50:14,680
If you did enjoy our show, please tell two people about the show.

3814
02:50:14,680 --> 02:50:18,040
Help us spread the word because we're not a multi-million dollar organization.

02:50:18,040 --> 02:50:22,000
You know, we're excited when we have $10 in the budget to spend on a Facebook ad.

3816
02:50:22,000 --> 02:50:25,160
So we really, really can use your guys' help in helping us spread the word of Orange Lounge

3817
02:50:25,160 --> 02:50:26,160
Radio.

3818
02:50:26,160 --> 02:50:27,160
That's all we ask.

3819
02:50:27,160 --> 02:50:28,160
Alright?

3820
02:50:28,160 --> 02:50:29,160
