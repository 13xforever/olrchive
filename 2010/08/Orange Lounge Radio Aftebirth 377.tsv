19707	20427	Okay, guys.
21888	22468	Shut up.
24468	26129	I didn't intend for that to happen, I swear.
26229	26469	All right.
26589	27909	That was a couple of shit.
28069	28370	Shut up.
28810	29130	All right.
29190	30550	That was too good.
30570	31070	All right.
31090	35212	We got to save part B. In order to do that, I have to stop the recording for a minute and play some music.
35232	37292	So we'll be right back in two minutes with the afterbirth.
37792	39613	And yes, right, Dan, there's even more show to go.
40173	40553	Sweet.
40673	40873	All right.
40893	41553	We'll be right back, guys.
41573	42414	It's the sticky part.
42554	42694	Ew.
42714	44394	Ew.
47652	49573	My thoughts exactly We'll be right back
181598	183500	Hi, we're back with the Orange Launch Radio Afterbirth.
183520	188303	This is the part of the show that's too hot to podcast, and I really apologize that we don't have a webcam anymore.
188323	188884	Way too hot.
189064	190845	You guys missed it during the break there.
191486	192947	Dan was doing the lasso.
194608	196390	Mystique was trying to white people dance.
198030	199611	I was white people dancing.
201031	201952	And it was pretty scary.
201972	203932	You were trying to... I did the sprinkler.
203952	204272	It was fun.
204292	206733	You were trying to glow stick rave without glow sticks.
206773	206953	Yes.
207273	208114	And with the lights on.
208134	209534	That was a very rave-y song.
209774	210654	It was fun.
211034	213095	And meanwhile, I'm over here sitting... I don't know these people.
213115	213775	I don't know these people.
213935	214435	All these people.
214475	215716	Somebody's confused!
215956	217476	You were kind of wagging your finger a little bit.
217516	220377	She was over there trying to get more viruses off her computer.
221078	221438	Dan!
223638	224619	Where's my treble? !
226630	227871	In the closet with Rob.
229312	231293	Rob is not in the closet.
231333	233775	So I ain't in the closet.
234095	234555	True that.
235496	235856	All right.
236036	238678	Usually we would do the cage match right about now.
238998	241019	But we don't have a cage match right now because Loki ain't here.
242400	243641	They wouldn't let me pick a song.
244061	244381	No, we will.
244902	246323	And they banned my idea of a song.
246563	248404	I would have been afraid of what Dan would pick for a song.
248924	250645	But we will do some FUs.
250665	251886	Did we get sufficient chat remains?
251926	252307	Six.
252747	253487	I thought you said four.
253687	254528	Well, I've been nice.
255008	256029	I like even numbers, Rob.
257506	258307	You're never nice.
258627	260009	Play the music!
261210	262272	She's trying to confuse people.
270441	275608	The first one is... Mike's out.
276008	276429	F you to the mic.
279425	294897	Heihachi Suendoshi, who's also Alpha Kananagram, F you to Hatsune Miku Project Diva 2nd for not including the song Far Away by KZ, my favorite song from Diva 1, yet including the level, stage, elements, and edit mode.
295358	296639	Maybe it's a special unlock.
297119	298740	Dan, have you ever played Project Diva?
299541	301322	I have no idea what you're talking about.
301362	303284	It's a Hatsune Miku.
303304	304865	It can't be the game I'd play if I still had PSP.
304885	305946	That makes me want to kill you.
308925	311306	Ranma, F you to my friend's husband.
311346	315749	Be thankful I didn't slap you out at Otakon last weekend.
316089	317310	You ungrateful piece of trash.
317570	318770	Yeah, fuck that guy.
318930	322813	You should get on the knees and worship that woman because she does a lot more than you think.
323193	326475	And also stop blowing your paycheck on frivolous shit and take care of your kids.
326895	328015	Dude, seriously.
330417	336200	DJ Blaze Kid, F you to Westroads Mall Arcade for fixing everything else but in the groove.
337753	338934	Twigak.
338954	339955	Can't fix a broken game.
342237	342757	I'm terrible.
343157	345519	F you to my computer for being the slowest piece of crap ever.
345619	349102	I will smash you to the ground if you don't shape up Twigak's computer.
349542	350623	Thanks for scaring my computer.
350643	352504	Yeah, fuck that computer.
353946	354486	Jodea.
354506	359270	F you to you for demanding F you to you, you demanding wench, you heart.
360050	361391	Yeah, fuck that wench.
363293	363793	You know what?
365919	368920	Patty, that was amazingly hot.
370400	371620	I can't stop thinking about you now.
372741	374181	I have no idea what happened.
375841	378722	Last one, Emei Satsuma, F you for getting jury duty.
379142	382903	At least I was able to request a postponement because of school is coming up.
383543	387484	Dan just got a look on his face like, oh, I think I got jury duty this week.
389773	390534	Jury duty.
391014	392315	Fuck it right in the ear.
392335	393215	You do have jury duty?
393235	395497	Fuck it with something hard and sandpaper.
396697	397598	You do have jury duty?
397618	398278	I don't know.
399279	400540	You might want to find out.
400580	402481	You kind of like have to go.
402982	406063	Or you call them and tell them you have severe diarrhea and you can't do it.
406164	408065	I have to call in.
408985	410286	Tell them that you've died of dysentery.
410326	413628	Tell them you were in the fucking hospital last week and they'll probably do it.
413648	414429	No, it wasn't last week.
414469	415349	I think it's this week.
415630	415750	Oh.
416590	417491	Like starting tomorrow.
417911	418191	Shit.
418231	418872	So you better call in.
419622	426245	Thanks to my wife for telling me what I already knew.
426265	426845	Fuck her!
427185	428406	I thought that was kind of the point.
428666	429806	That's what got you in trouble.
432687	434728	I like mustard on my french fries.
437389	441811	What the hell is happening to this program?
441871	442691	It imploded.
443131	444732	You know what the show needs more of?
446413	446953	Structure.
448874	453478	I swear to God, if she put on that Vuvuzela thing, I was going to throw her phone in the toilet.
453778	454259	Me too.
454359	454639	What?
455240	456201	Nothing.
456221	457362	Why did I forget my ferret?
457982	459323	What are you talking about, the Vuvuzela?
459744	462226	I have fucking no idea what you're talking about.
462266	462907	Don't do it.
463387	464168	I'll unplug your mic.
465729	467931	She's doing it here.
468251	469372	What are you grabbing me for?
471341	478947	For your information, Dan, for your information, Dan, four square, bitch.
479147	482270	Well, I forgot to check in because I want to become the mayor of the house.
482450	483931	You're never going to be the mayor of the house, Rob.
484011	484552	I check in every day.
484572	486013	Yes, I'm the mayor of Walgreens.
487514	491317	We went right by the Walgreens near my house, and I said, I should check in here.
491677	492738	Rob is the mayor.
492858	495581	Rob lives nowhere near the damn Walgreens by my house.
495941	497622	Yeah, Rob is the mayor of Walgreens.
498843	499444	Don't feel bad.
499464	500745	How does this happen?
500945	501405	Don't feel bad.
501425	503207	I'm the mayor of the Walgreens across from my work.
503547	504388	And naturally my work.
504608	507570	I'm the mayor of a Chinese restaurant over by my house.
508231	509272	Aren't you the mayor of Cowschwitz?
509992	512694	I got dethroned as the mayor of Cowschwitz, which pissed me off.
512775	513215	Actually, no.
513535	517739	Melody was the mayor of Cowschwitz, and I was the mayor of Near the Stinky Cows on I-5.
517759	518960	That's right.
519020	519700	That's right.
520941	521341	And let's see.
521362	522062	What else am I the mayor of?
522082	523023	I'm the mayor of one other place.
523578	524418	and I can't remember what it is.
524439	524839	Walgreens.
525219	525919	No, it's not Walgreens.
526099	528641	I'm the mayor of Walgreens, the Chinese restaurant and one other place.
528681	529141	I can't remember.
529161	530342	Another Walgreens.
531182	533364	Hold on.
533464	535965	Rob, you should create a place that calls the chair in Jamie's house.
537446	538567	The chair at Jamie's house.
539447	540608	I will let you be the mayor of the chair.
541488	542669	Practically in the closet.
543449	545451	In the closet at Jamie's house.
548089	548669	That's right, Ranma.
548689	550070	The fabulous OLR Studios.
550110	553252	Ranma in our chatroom says, Rob is the fabulous mayor of Walgreens.
553292	554393	Fabulous.
556794	558315	Am I really that gay, you guys?
558415	558855	Come on.
559656	561577	You are wearing a shirt with a hot dog on it.
561617	562838	No, no, no.
563358	565499	It's not just a shirt with a hot dog on it.
565659	566900	It has a rainbow, too.
567440	567841	It does.
568061	568421	It does.
569222	572423	You should take a picture of my shirt, but I just don't want my fat old gut to be out there.
572704	574285	It just needs glitter to make it complete.
574325	574545	Hold on.
574585	575565	I'm trying to see where I'm the mayor.
575585	576446	I'm the mayor of three places.
577236	578137	Jack in the Box!
578437	580999	You're the mayor of Jack in the Box.
581239	585122	A week ago, Jack in the Box sent out the most amazing coupon sheet.
585182	586764	It had all sorts of cool freebies on it.
588865	590527	Rob totally made the Pee Wee Herman face.
592408	592689	Let's see.
592769	593549	Oh, I'm checking in.
593589	593910	Hold on.
593950	594530	Places.
597192	598313	I gotta be careful how I do this.
598333	599434	I don't want to tell the listeners where you live.
599454	600735	This is so too hot for the podcast.
600815	601336	I know, right?
601376	602657	This is amazing radio right now.
604778	606260	As Rob plays with his iPhone.
606320	606700	Live!
607256	607916	On the air.
608436	609717	Jamie is the mayor.
609877	610277	Let's see.
610317	611017	Check in here.
611037	611878	Fuck yes, I'm the mayor.
611898	612398	You're the mayor of where?
612718	613218	This house.
614979	615319	Really?
615339	616539	Yes.
616679	617640	That's just pathetic.
618440	619560	At least on Foursquare.
619580	629524	I just had to check to make sure my zipper was up when she took... All Games Radio is switching between its live and on-demand feed.
629804	631005	This may take several moments.
631365	631805	Visit all...
660649	669855	What happened?
679662	680142	Be back.
685146	685426	Alright.
685606	685926	Alright.
687958	688839	Mad Libs Mad Libs
720268	721228	Pretty good timing, though.
721248	722889	The claw.
723029	723929	It is our master.
725110	726830	It decides who will go and who will stay.
726850	729912	You can ask us anything you want.
730372	730992	Within reason.
731732	732753	Ask Orange Lounge.
732893	733253	Type.
733693	734353	Message.
734653	737774	You can ask anything unreasonable, but we may not answer it.
737915	739615	That's right.
740075	741316	Ask what color Misty's undies are.
741456	743237	I'm going to tell her.
743297	744177	I'm going to have to speak.
744197	745537	Because she'll tell you.
746838	747138	All right.
748556	749437	She's checking.
754020	755101	I just looked over.
758364	759805	Panties were hanging out.
762027	763468	It was all for you, Rob.
763488	764929	Jamie's taking pictures.
767776	768096	What?
768256	769557	I can't even turn around.
770617	771377	Rob, Rob, Rob.
771437	773778	Dan gets on the show, all hell breaks loose.
774359	775339	I'm making shit happen.
775379	777580	I've got girls taking their pants off.
777620	778260	It's crazy.
779100	780741	It's crazy around here.
780941	781521	Dan, dude.
781541	782782	Rob, it's fine.
782862	784682	It's misty.
785623	788664	It's misty and misty being on the same time.
790085	791245	Do not put that on the internet.
791285	792626	I would not put that on the internet.
792706	794326	I'm putting it on our website.
794366	795447	Don't put it on the internet.
797276	798897	Look, stars!
799477	801858	It's just, it's not like she's going beaver.
801878	804300	Now I want to watch Roger Rabbit.
805300	807581	Can we do... Are you ready?
807921	809382	Ask OLR.
809402	811523	Look, every little red screen right there is a question.
811623	812964	So we got a lot of questions.
813024	813444	I'm seriously crying.
813464	813604	Alright.
818019	819980	Ranma says, I demand a fucking web camera.
820160	821561	Alright, can we go?
821641	822061	Can we go?
822161	823342	Tough shit, Ranma.
823422	823962	Alright, here we go.
824843	825503	Sing a song.
826184	828145	Can you help me out, Dan?
829545	832527	Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.
833007	836389	What will we find out tonight on Orange Lounge Radio?
836709	839431	Will we find out the color of Mystique's panties?
839711	842613	I deeply wish I had a lyric because I want to sing that song.
842633	842933	I'm done.
843953	846155	That's like if we're trying to sing about some chick's panties.
846195	846796	It is very fun.
847256	849898	I had a good time singing the song with you.
853460	855542	The greatest thing is this part isn't recorded.
858357	860117	Actually, I do have a recording running.
860177	862978	I usually just throw this out, but tonight I might save it.
863018	865479	You should save it for the DVD that we're never going to do.
865499	866279	The DVD we're never going to do.
866899	867880	We will do the DVD.
867940	868840	Free with every t-shirt.
868960	870921	We will do the DVD.
870981	873441	If we ever get the damn shirts out.
874582	877023	Gold Anthro asks, what color are Misty's underwear?
879323	881224	They are blue with stars on them.
881684	883305	Stars and moons.
883605	884265	And moons.
884983	886766	But no pink diamonds or horseshoes.
888729	889410	Or Pikachus.
889710	893636	DJ Blaziken asks, what was your first Bomani experience?
893937	895339	I'm going to defer this question to Dan.
895559	897783	What was your first Bomani experience?
901193	902333	I guess it would have been what?
902973	904474	Me bringing that Burn Over?
904994	906834	No, I mean, it was in the arcade for sure.
907594	910815	No, we had the... Down at Milpitas.
911035	912295	No, it was at Disneyland.
912775	913756	No, it was before that.
914296	918837	We played DDR in 99 when they were first coming out in California.
918897	922677	I remember, though, pretty early on, I imported the Dreamcast version for Jamie.
922697	923498	He got it for me for my birthday.
923518	926378	That was probably the only version of DDR that I really bothered to play.
926478	929919	Then Julie bought a second dance pad, which I promptly stole from her and never gave back.
930507	931449	No, he's not kidding.
931489	932370	It's in the box.
932891	935154	No, no, we still have it in the box.
937417	940180	And if you ask her about it, she'll probably say, oh, I should get that back from you.
940200	947831	Honestly, my first momentary experience where I really enjoyed it was Guitar Freaks at Milpitas.
948479	966325	Which George got me to play because George was like, no, no, no, it's cool, you'll like this Because I was like, DJ, fuck that game, I'm gonna play Street Fighter And he was like, no, man, you gotta try Guitar Freaks, and I played Guitar Freaks And Guitar Freaks at first was the greatest Bimani game because you could suck at it, but it didn't hack you too hard
966650	967271	I hate that fucking game.
989867	993048	Ranma asks, Sky, how fabulous are you?
994369	994709	Why?
995409	997610	I will defer to the others in studio.
997891	998911	How fabulous am I?
999051	1003193	To quote Ulala, in a paraphrase, you are fabulous.
1003773	1004554	Hot dog!
1006935	1007315	Misty?
1007335	1008275	Boom shakalaka.
1009356	1012577	I'm not quite sure brilliant comes to mind, though.
1012917	1013858	Jaguar!
1014178	1016059	Jaguar!
1016099	1016419	Jaguar!
1019199	1023623	SSJ100 Matt asks, how did Dan propose to Jamie?
1024984	1025745	Did you propose?
1027967	1028907	Even I know this story.
1029007	1030889	If I know this story and you two don't.
1031049	1033131	We just more like decided that we were going to do it.
1033351	1035313	I think it had something to do with pro wrestling.
1035533	1037395	No, no, no, no, no.
1037495	1038716	We were watching UHF.
1039016	1039857	Was it UHF?
1040277	1041338	On Valentine's Day.
1041378	1043480	We were watching something and there was a lot of sex involved.
1043500	1045341	And Jamie got to drink from the fire hose.
1045521	1046362	Just so you know.
1048024	1048244	Yuck.
1050089	1055731	No, but we were drinking, we were, no, this is how you knew that one day your wife would be Jewish.
1056232	1057532	Because we were drinking Manischewitz.
1058012	1059613	I fucking didn't know you were going to be Jewish.
1061054	1063795	I still barely, I still barely, I still don't even want to realize that.
1065716	1066436	Mazel Tov!
1066596	1067917	Mazel Tov!
1068377	1070818	I'm going to get seven days of presents.
1071705	1076509	I love pencils and erasers.
1076549	1078210	Dan is a real humanitarian.
1078470	1080592	He tries to see the good in everything.
1080672	1081632	My wife's going to be Jewish.
1081933	1084875	Eight days of presents!
1088097	1089838	Yay, two Christmases!
1090259	1097684	I just now see the irony in the proposed, the sort of co-decision.
1102780	1104562	When are you all coming to New York City?
1105183	1106484	New York City?
1106524	1121338	Get a rope When I ain't a broke ass When Sister Act is on Broadway Yeah, I need to accumulate some money before I can come crash When someone invites me for free I've never been to New York
1122017	1122377	I have.
1123398	1124539	It's pretty fantastic.
1124680	1126601	I do love New York.
1126761	1130685	This is how long ago I went to New York.
1131506	1135009	There were still these really two large buildings and one of them had a hole in it.
1135910	1138392	There are so many ways to die in New York City.
1139253	1140534	Thank you, Dennis Leary.
1141875	1143957	But Rob, does that date when I went?
1143977	1145499	Start spreading the news.
1146280	1147841	Well, I've already been to Chicago sometimes.
1148334	1149094	I love New York.
1149395	1150095	Chicago.
1150415	1152816	I have the best nights out in New York City.
1152876	1153337	You know why?
1153377	1154577	Because they never end.
1155117	1156798	I want to go to New York with Rob.
1157459	1158599	We will have the best time.
1158639	1159920	We're going to go to Broadway.
1160140	1161361	Broadway.
1162261	1162861	Next question.
1162961	1165463	We're going to go see Mamma Mia on Broadway.
1165483	1168244	Yeah, we can make Go LRG finally happen and it can happen in New York.
1168769	1171690	Giovedea is asking quite a few questions here.
1172190	1173110	Some of them have already been asked.
1173730	1174291	We'll start here.
1174811	1177732	If you had Lady Tatas, what would their names be?
1178192	1179052	Ooh, Dan.
1180612	1183133	Maybe that could be Lady Gaga's sidekick, Lady Tata.
1186874	1188935	Dr. Evil and Professor Chaos.
1189795	1192956	I think mine would have, well, on that note, then I would have to name one.
1193096	1193696	Alejandro.
1193716	1193896	Alejandro.
1194597	1196159	and the other one, I don't know.
1196699	1197120	Enrique.
1197140	1197700	Telephone.
1197721	1201044	Rikki Martin.
1201264	1202726	Yeah, Rikki Martin and Alejandro.
1202766	1203066	All right.
1204888	1207791	And Giovedeo wants to know, Rob, will you be my gay boyfriend?
1209814	1211275	Have we ever played that song on the show before?
1211295	1212396	Do you have a lot of money?
1212537	1215360	Well, when it comes to being the hag...
1216030	1222334	DarkTetsuya says, since there probably won't be a show, can we finally run the best of next week?
1222374	1225796	If I'm not too lazy to upload it to the all game server, sure.
1242736	1244757	Just get on me about that mid-week and I'll make sure it happens.
1245537	1247819	ToyGak asks, oh, a game question.
1247859	1249340	What is that, a video game question?
1249360	1251321	I thought he was going to ask me what color undies I was wearing.
1251581	1252062	Alright, here we go.
1253222	1264570	ToyGak asks, Would you rather have a game with an amazing storyline but last-gen graphics or amazing graphics and a poor storyline?
1265631	1267752	I would go with amazing storyline.
1270336	1276218	Graphics cease to mean anything after your first few hours of playing the game, so the storyline is pretty much vital.
1277659	1278979	Are you comparing panties?
1279059	1280440	What is going on over there?
1281840	1282781	Take off your shirts!
1284201	1288943	Oh god, she did it!
1289223	1290924	Shit's getting crazy up in here!
1291184	1292484	Where's the malt liquor?
1295625	1297486	That's not my panties I was talking about.
1297506	1298306	By the way, very nice.
1305303	1312325	Actually, I want amazing graphics and poor storyline because you know the spanking game has no storyline whatsoever and that sounds better than anything else.
1312945	1315846	Spanking and massage.
1316326	1317006	Simspank.
1317386	1318166	What's the next question?
1319066	1320567	I'm getting to it, I'm getting to it.
1321327	1324127	Toagak also asks, why are there so many nicknames for boobs?
1324227	1325988	Boobs, knockers, tits, fun bags, etc.
1328933	1329393	Jumblies.
1330134	1330894	Why not?
1332315	1335097	Because breasts sound so formal.
1336839	1340702	People do stupid shit like name their cars, so why not?
1341402	1344785	There's a song that talks about the many names of a penis.
1346526	1347407	Monty Python did it.
1347667	1348508	Tallywhacker.
1349628	1351049	Isn't it awfully nice to have a penis?
1351630	1352951	Isn't it awfully good to have a dung?
1354092	1356674	Your piece of pork, your wife's best friend, your pussy or your cock.
1357155	1358416	You can wrap it up in ribbons.
1358436	1359997	You can stick it in your sock.
1360318	1364862	Amaze Satsuma says, can you give me a job slash occupation for Mad Libs?
1365302	1366023	Jizzmopper.
1370194	1371855	Actually, I prefer Cumbucket.
1371875	1372796	Erotic Engineer.
1376298	1377719	I like Cumbucket.
1377819	1378440	Frisbee.
1379020	1381982	Dear Strong Bad, how do you type with boxing gloves on your hands?
1382403	1383484	Wrong show.
1384264	1386286	That question was totally crappy.
1390250	1390590	That's it.
1390810	1391711	That was all the questions.
1392091	1393232	I have a question, Rob.
1393552	1393793	What?
1394233	1395474	What the fuck are we on?
1395694	1396034	I don't know.
1396414	1398736	But that's going to do it for Ask Orange Lounge.
1398816	1400197	All Games Radio!
1400297	1401878	Who said we need to be on anything?
1403163	1403983	I'm not even unbiking it.
1404023	1407245	That's all the time we have for Ask Orange Lounge.
1407565	1410886	We hope you learned something tonight on Orange Lounge Radio.
1411727	1412907	SD has blue panties.
1413328	1414608	Blue underwear.
1414968	1418270	That's all I learned and now I'm scarred for the rest of the night.
1418990	1420511	Good for you.
1422512	1422832	P.S.
1422852	1423292	Jizzmonger.
1427051	1428473	Alright, Ranma's asking a serious question.
1428493	1429956	Actually, this is a serious question.
1430256	1430517	Uh-oh.
1430597	1431037	Downer.
1431218	1434182	Alright, Ranma's saying... Thanks, Ranma.
1434222	1435464	I don't think I've ever told this on a show.
1435484	1436286	Are we really going to do this?
1436546	1436907	Sure, why not?
1436947	1437167	Do it.
1437367	1440753	Ranma says, when did you come out of the closet and how did your family take it?
1441923	1442963	Dan, do you want to answer this?
1444324	1446044	They knew when I was young.
1446064	1454587	In Dan's case, when they finally removed the deadbolt and he came out blinking into the sunlight for the first time in 13 years.
1454607	1456448	They were all surprisingly accepting.
1456688	1457288	Here's the deal.
1457308	1457728	Here's the deal.
1458189	1461930	My mom asked me for like three months straight every day, are you gay?
1462270	1462670	Are you gay?
1462750	1462990	Are you gay?
1463030	1464371	And it kind of got annoying.
1464451	1465051	I was like, because
1465424	1466165	This is what it was.
1466625	1474153	I didn't like the fact, you know, because I had a tough time in high school because I got called fag and all that stuff a lot in high school and I didn't really like it.
1474454	1479039	And I didn't really know I was gay then because I was just trying to be normal, you know, have a girlfriend and, you know, this is how we roll.
1479359	1482102	You know, I'm a hot stud playing the clarinet in the marching band, right?
1482529	1489251	So, you know, and trying to do that whole thing, I didn't really want to admit I was gay because I didn't want all those people to be right.
1489911	1493313	But then when I kind of realized I was gay, like I, that was one of the first things I had to conquer.
1493353	1496233	So when my mom joined in on it, I really didn't appreciate it.
1496574	1500895	Finally, one day it actually kind of exploded in a, yes, are you happy?
1500975	1501815	Now leave me alone.
1501855	1503696	And she ran off to her room to cry for the rest of the day.
1504316	1504877	Bitches.
1504937	1505317	Bitches.
1505337	1505477	Alright.
1505497	1505557	But...
1531280	1539147	Then the next day she came out with her eyes all puffy and she's like, I just want you to know I still love you and I've known since you were four.
1540308	1541328	And I'm like, how do you know?
1541589	1543751	I didn't know until I was like 17.
1543811	1544911	How do you know when you're four?
1545292	1546833	Because mothers always know.
1546853	1551637	We had a kid in my family, my eldest cousin, who was gay.
1552398	1553719	I miss him.
1553899	1554379	I never...
1555653	1557574	I never put too and too into it.
1557614	1558655	It was just he was who he was.
1558735	1564579	But my folks and people in my family were always like, we knew from the time he was a young, young boy that he was gay.
1565959	1571703	There's a part of me that doesn't like that, though, because it insinuates that being gay you act a certain way, and I don't think that's true.
1573284	1574745	As I sit here with my legs crossed.
1574785	1576206	It's so fucking true, though.
1576246	1576986	Tapping on the table.
1577286	1580168	It's not like you can't act gay if you're straight.
1580188	1581469	You can't act straight if you're gay, but...
1582506	1586091	But what is straight acting and gay acting?
1586131	1587032	There's not, you know.
1587473	1588615	You know what I'm talking about.
1588675	1588875	I know.
1588935	1590577	You fucking know what I'm talking about.
1590637	1591258	I do, but.
1591298	1593622	And I understand, I'm not trying to perpetuate the stereotype.
1593662	1594683	Okay, I appreciate that.
1594703	1597888	But like, I looked at Rob when I first met you and I was like, wow.
1600413	1628418	and you're not wearing like feather boas and shit although he has I didn't come in and go hi Dan I was just like oh you know not in a bad way Dan's gaydar has improved I wasn't threatening I probably had my arm around Jamie and we were skipping and Dan was like somehow this is not threatening to me I'm not a threatened kind of guy that's true that's true
1629638	1633519	Dan knows that I have complete and utter devotion to the gays.
1634359	1635940	To the gays, exactly.
1636060	1640681	The truth is, you know, I realize that any who oppose me can be summarily dealt with.
1641121	1645222	Yeah, dealt with.
1645282	1645602	All right.
1645622	1648102	Do you know what I finally told my mom about that I had a girlfriend before?
1648602	1648862	Really?
1648962	1649543	You know what she said?
1649603	1649803	What?
1650303	1651043	I don't need to hear that.
1652199	1652539	Me either.
1653560	1654541	You do?
1654561	1663709	Alright, well, here's the other thing that's important, because my mom said, and this is a very important part of the story, is my mom said, I called your grandma, and I told her, I'm like, why are you telling everybody?
1664149	1666691	She's like, no, I want you to know what your grandma said, because it meant a lot.
1667051	1669593	She said, I told your grandma that you were gay, and I'm like, what'd she say?
1670014	1671935	And my grandma said, so what?
1675078	1677380	So rest in peace, Grandma Shaw.
1677762	1678022	All right.
1678763	1679063	Anyhow.
1679083	1681324	You know, Dan, I do miss your cousin.
1681945	1682345	Yes, me too.
1682365	1684006	Because I got along really well with your cousin.
1684126	1685267	He was a cool cat.
1686727	1688929	No, we'll talk about that.
1689009	1691350	Lastly, God, it's like the all-gay OLR.
1691430	1694872	DJ Blaziken asks, what do you think about Prop 8 being put in the fire?
1695993	1700696	Obviously, obviously it needed to happen, and it's a good thing, but
1701295	1702016	Thanks for watching!
1711909	1714970	But honestly, this issue just isn't over until the Supreme Court decides on it.
1715050	1717071	And I am a little nervous about the Supreme Court deciding.
1717091	1718872	Whose rights are we going to take away next?
1719412	1730976	I just hope that history and things that happened in, you know, Loving v. Virginia and some of these other things that happened in the past will kind of set the precedence for overturning Prop 8 at the Supreme Court level.
1731496	1732097	But I worry.
1732497	1738199	There's unfortunately that many ignoramus people in the world who, for whatever reason, want to have their say in my life.
1738399	1741741	The moment they bring the 14th Amendment into it, you know it becomes an even bigger issue.
1742602	1750587	And I kind of think that some of those pro-Prop 8 people might actually have more to fear if it goes to the Supreme Court.
1751107	1758872	Because then if they uphold the ruling that yes, this is unconstitutional, that's national precedent.
1759092	1762294	They're a bunch of scared-ass, insecure fuckers.
1762514	1763475	I know, it's just like, what?
1767361	1775925	I assure you, I don't want to have my wedding in a church and I'm not going to sue any church that doesn't want to have my wedding because I'm not...
1777631	1779872	I just, people can do whatever they want to do.
1780172	1780873	No, here's what I have to say.
1780893	1782053	You can do whatever you want to do.
1782133	1783114	Let me do what I want to do.
1784094	1785295	Rob, here's what I have to say.
1785595	1785735	What?
1786056	1798022	Is it okay if, you know, the fundamental Christians want to use Leviticus as their standing point for saying, you know, which is actually in Jewish law, man shall not lay with another man like a woman.
1798582	1800425	That just means that I guess you can't have boobs or something.
1801407	1810420	But anyway, if the Christians want to use Leviticus, they also have to keep kosher and grow out their beards and wear tall black hats like the Hasidic do.
1810891	1839956	I put the fun in fundamentalist well it's not even quote the bible all you want or any religious text but there's like an amendment in the constitution that says freedom of religion meaning I am free of your religion well see and that's my other point I mean my point is that if they're trying to use if they're trying to use a law when they admittedly don't follow the laws themselves then that's just being hypocritical
1842579	1843419	Here's the end of the thing.
1843779	1849022	I am encouraged by the fact that folks our age, and I see a lot of people in chat going, I have a gay friend, who cares?
1849362	1849822	I don't care.
1850202	1856045	And that seems to be the attitude of most 18 to 35 year olds in this day and age.
1856065	1857025	They just need to vote.
1857165	1863408	So the good news is, when we're the old farts on the Supreme Court making the decisions, this will be over.
1864328	1867570	We're just going to have to wait for the ignorant people to pass on.
1868317	1884805	Well, I mean, if you take a look at the Civil Rights Movement, the 14th Amendment passed 100 years before Brown versus the Board of Education and the Montgomery Boycott, the Montgomery Best Boycott with Rosa Parks.
1885566	1887807	And so how many of us our age look back on that and go,
1888257	1890238	So even if I'm not around to see it
1918468	1921390	I know someday it will change.
1930498	1936981	I'm just saying, if anyone is still listening, make sure that when the opportunity comes up for you to vote on important issues like this, that you do it.
1937021	1941823	Because I was watching the voter turnout during the whole Prop 8 thing, and I was completely dismayed.
1941983	1947865	We were really relying on the Berkeley area, and the voter turnout was only something like 52%.
1949986	1953931	And it could have completely turned the whole thing because the vote was 52 to 49.
1955873	1960959	Just if the rest of the voting population had put in the effort, it wouldn't have even been an issue.
1962020	1962881	So, I'm just saying.
1963356	1969182	This was a very interesting election year, though, because either way the tide had gone, you were going to have a minority in the White House.
1969362	1972665	Either you had a racial minority or you had a sexual minority.
1973046	1977290	You would have had one crazy-ass fucking woman in the White House, but you would have had a woman in the White House, you know?
1979052	1979512	You know what?
1979712	1980133	You know what?
1980593	1982735	I think my problem with Hillary is that she...
1983636	1984436	No, I'm not even talking to her.
1984476	1985357	I'm talking to Sarah Palin.
1985617	1990159	Hillary hasn't been to primaries.
1990199	1995102	But whatever happened, you would have had a minority in the White House when we were there.
1995222	2000624	I felt... Two minorities right there.
2000724	2002005	Two minorities in one.
2002025	2003866	Mystique's going to run and that's going to be the bill.
2003886	2004726	This is what we need.
2005347	2007388	What we need, Rob, is a Jewish black woman.
2009288	2010329	What we need is just
2011013	2012674	Someone who's not a dick.
2012694	2013755	That's just all I want.
2015156	2016256	I'm not going to get too political.
2016556	2018178	That means I'll never be president.
2019618	2020819	President Dan.
2020859	2022400	Because I put the dick in dictator.
2023421	2023981	Rob, no.
2024561	2025102	We need Renna.
2026463	2026983	We need Renna.
2027023	2027623	President Cat.
2027643	2027904	That's right.
2028004	2028564	That's what we need.
2028584	2029084	President Cat.
2029605	2030405	You will meow this mess.
2030845	2031106	Alright.
2033755	2034895	Should we declare nuclear war?
2036376	2037797	Would you like to play a game?
2037957	2042958	Let's go to the fortune cookie masters of the day.
2042998	2044039	This show's getting too deep.
2044219	2047400	I mean, this is supposed to be a ha-ha funny show.
2047440	2048400	We sung the thing.
2048480	2049281	The segment's over.
2049341	2050301	Quit asking questions.
2051562	2052262	What the hell?
2052702	2054363	Erotic chat in Goldshire.
2055823	2057824	Keep in mind, this is what happens when geeks grow up.
2058861	2059341	Geeks!
2060122	2061202	Guess what, all you kids?

2068846	2070927	Here's your fortune cookie message of the day, kids.
2073949	2075530	That's a fucking leprechaun.
2079252	2080653	That's rockstar shit.
2080933	2083135	The Leprechaun is amazing.
2083355	2084776	I'll eat your dog and shine your shoes.
2084857	2086238	Fuck you, I'm a Leprechaun.
2087018	2089440	Magically delicious, yellow moons, pink hearts, fuck you.
2090241	2091642	I'll eat your dog and shine your shoes.
2091862	2093483	They'll eat your fucking dog.
2093864	2094985	They're not fucking around.
2095705	2097026	And they'll shine your shoes.
2097767	2098788	That's a complete 180.
2099969	2102130	I saw the movie Leprechaun years back.
2102631	2103611	Awesome piece of film.
2104412	2106653	They eat your dog, but they'll shine your shoes.
2106933	2108233	One minute, the next minute.
2108493	2109113	And you know what?
2109594	2114435	My dog's important to me because my dog licks, but a fucking leprechaun.
2114895	2118276	Whoever came up with that, by the way, fucking genius.
2118516	2119676	They are drunk.
2119857	2120477	They're mean.
2120557	2121097	They're green.
2121117	2122097	They got rotted teeth.
2122177	2123198	All they care about is money.
2123238	2123958	They're my agent.
2125138	2126358	I'll eat your dog and shine your shoes.
2126458	2126879	Fuck you.
2127359	2127879	Irish spring.
2129462	2131324	They're wonderful little fucking creatures.
2131404	2135587	And if you go outside when you leave here tonight, you fucking see a leprechaun.
2135607	2137388	You shoot that motherfucking thing.
2137609	2138469	You kill that dead.
2138489	2139410	You put that down.
2140271	2141992	That was Bob Saget, believe it or not.
2142893	2143854	That's crazy, isn't it?
2143994	2144895	Night, Michelle.
