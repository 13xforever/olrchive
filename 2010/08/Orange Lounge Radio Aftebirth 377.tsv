0	24440	Okay, guys, quick- shut up!
24440	26240	I didn't intend for that to happen, I swear.
26240	27240	Alright.
27240	28240	That was- I got bullshit!
28240	29240	Shut up.
29240	30240	That was too good.
30240	34200	Alright, we gotta save part B, and in order to do that I have to stop the recording for
34200	37920	a minute and play some music, so we'll be right back in two minutes with the afterbirth,
37920	39920	and yes, right, Dan, there's even more show to go.
39920	40920	Sweet.
40920	41920	Alright, we'll be right back, guys.
41920	42920	It's the sticky part.
42920	43920	Ew.
43920	49920	My thoughts exactly- we'll be right back!
49920	69640	Okay.
159640	183600	Hi, we're back with the Orange Laundry afterbirth.
183600	187360	It's the part of the show that's too hot to podcast, and I really apologize that we don't
187360	189160	have a webcam anymore.
189160	191720	You guys missed it during the break there.
191720	197880	Dan was doing the lasso, Mystique was trying to white people dance.
197880	201120	I was white people dancing.
201120	202120	And it was pretty scary.
202120	203120	You were trying to...
203120	204120	I did the sprinkler.
204120	205120	It was fun.
205120	208160	You were trying to glow stick rave without glow sticks with the lights on.
208160	209720	That was a very ravy song.
209720	210720	It was fun.
210720	211720	I should have...
211720	212720	And meanwhile, I'm over here sitting...
212720	213720	I don't know these people.
213720	214720	I don't know these people.
214720	215720	I don't know these people.
215720	216720	Send me some confused!
216720	217720	You were kind of wagging your finger a little bit.
217720	218720	That was...
218720	219720	I was trying to get more viruses off the computer.
219720	220720	Dan, where's my treble?
220720	221720	He's in the closet with Rob.
221720	222720	Rob is not in the closet.
222720	223720	True that.
223720	224720	All right.
224720	239920	Usually, we would do the cage match right about now, but we don't have a cage match
239920	241920	right now because Loki ain't here, so...
241920	243620	They wouldn't let me pick a song.
243620	244620	But we will...
244620	245620	No, we will.
245620	246620	And they banned my idea of a song.
246620	249120	I would have been afraid of what Dan would pick for a song.
249120	250720	But we will do some FUs.
250720	252120	Do we get sufficient chat remains?
252120	253120	Six.
253120	254120	I thought you said four.
254120	255120	Well, I've been nice.
255120	257620	I like even numbers, Rob.
257620	258620	You're never nice.
258620	259620	Play your music!
259620	260620	She's trying to confuse people.
260620	271620	The first one is Heihachi Tsundoshi, who's also...
271620	277620	Mike's out, FU to the mic.
277620	285220	Heihachi Tsundoshi, who's also Alpha Kinanagram, FU to Hatsune Miku, Project Diva, second
285220	291000	for not including the song Faraway by, is it Kizz or KZ, my favorite song from Diva
291000	295520	One, yet including the level stage elements in edit mode.
295520	296520	Maybe it's a special unlock.
296520	298920	Dan, have you ever played Project Diva?
298920	301320	I have no idea what you're talking about.
301320	302320	Miku.
302320	304720	I can't have the game I would play if I still had a PSP.
304720	306720	That makes me want to kill you.
306720	311360	Ranma, FU to my friend's husband.
311360	317520	Be thankful I didn't slap you out at Otacon last weekend, you ungrateful piece of trash.
317520	319000	Yeah, fuck that guy!
319000	322480	You should get on the knees and worship that woman because she does a lot more than you
322480	323480	think.
323480	327520	And also stop blowing your paycheck on frivolous shit and take care of your kids.
327520	330480	Dude, seriously.
330480	338360	GJBlazeKid, FU to Westroads Mall Arcade for fixing everything else but in the groove.
338360	339360	Toygak.
339360	340360	Can't fix a broken game.
340360	341360	I'm terrible.
341360	345520	FU to my computer for being the slowest piece of crap ever.
345520	349520	I will smash you to the ground if you don't shape up Toygak's computer.
349520	350840	Thanks for scaring my computer.
350840	353840	Yeah, fuck that computer!
353840	360600	FU to you, you demanding wench, you heart.
360600	363360	Yeah, fuck that wench.
363360	370240	You know what, Patty, that was amazingly hot.
370240	372240	I can't stop thinking about you now.
372240	376080	I have no idea what happened.
376080	379160	Last one, MA says to my FU for getting jury duty.
379160	383600	At least I was able to request a postponement because of school is coming up.
383600	385600	Dan just got a look on his face like, oh fuck.
385600	387600	I think I had jury duty this week.
387600	388600	Fuck jury duty!
388600	389600	Fuck it right in the ear!
389600	390600	You do have jury duty?
390600	391600	Fuck it with something hard and sandpaper.
391600	392600	You do have jury duty?
392600	393600	I don't know.
393600	394600	You might want to find out.
394600	395600	You kind of like have to go.
395600	396600	Well I don't know.
396600	397600	Or you call them and tell them you have severe diarrhea and you can't do it.
397600	398600	I have to call in.
398600	399600	Tell them you have, tell them that you've died of dysentery.
399600	412600	Tell them you were in the fucking hospital last week.
412600	413600	Oh my god.
413600	414600	I can't believe we could have probably do it.
414600	415600	Oh it wasn't last week.
415600	416600	I think it's this week.
416600	417600	Like starting tomorrow.
417600	418600	Shit.
418600	419600	So you better call in.
419600	420600	Thanks for fucking with my wife.
420600	421600	Look at this.
421600	422600	Who's telling me what I already knew.
422600	423600	Fuck her!
423600	428600	I thought that was kind of the point.
428600	432600	That's what got you in trouble.
432600	437600	I like mustard on my French fries.
437600	441600	What the hell is happening to this person?
441600	446400	You know what the show needs more of?
446400	447400	Structure?
447400	453800	I swear to god if she put on that Vuvuzela thing I was gonna throw her phone in the toilet.
453800	454800	Me too.
454800	455800	What?
455800	456800	Nothing.
456800	457800	Why did I forget my favorite?
457800	458800	What are you talking about, the Vuvuzela?
458800	459800	I have no idea what you're talking about.
459800	460800	Don't do it.
460800	461800	I'll unplug your mic.
461800	462800	She's doing it.
462800	463800	What did you grab me for?
463800	464800	She wanted me.
464800	475200	Do you have any idea what's happening here?
475200	478880	For your information, Dan, four square, bitch.
478880	479880	Vuvuzela?
479880	482560	I forgot to check in because I want to become the mayor of the house.
482560	483960	You're never gonna be the mayor of the house, Rob.
483960	484960	I check in every day.
484960	485960	Yes, I'm the mayor of Walgreens.
485960	491520	We went right by the Walgreens near my house and I said, I should check in here.
491520	492840	Rob is the mayor.
492840	499000	Rob lives nowhere near the damn Walgreens by the house, yet Rob is the mayor of Walgreens.
499000	500000	Don't feel bad.
500000	501000	I'm the mayor.
501000	502000	How does this happen?
502000	503000	Don't feel bad.
503000	504000	I'm the mayor of the Walgreens across from my work.
504000	505000	And naturally my work.
505000	507560	I'm the mayor of a Chinese restaurant over by my house.
507560	509920	Aren't you the mayor of Kaushwitz?
509920	513000	I got dethroned as the mayor of Kaushwitz, which pissed me off.
513000	517100	Actually no, Melody was the mayor of Kaushwitz and I was the mayor of near the stinky cows
517100	518100	on I-5.
518100	519100	That's right.
519100	521100	That's right.
521100	522100	And let's see, what else am I the mayor of?
522100	524960	I'm the mayor of one other place and I can't remember what it is.
524960	525960	Walgreens.
525960	526960	No, it's not Walgreens.
526960	528680	I'm the mayor of Walgreens, the Chinese restaurant and one other place.
528680	529680	I can't remember.
529680	530680	Another Walgreens.
530680	531680	I was the...
531680	532680	Hold on.
532680	533680	Rob, you should create a...
533680	534680	I'm not the mayor of Taco Bell.
534680	537500	You should create a place that calls the chair in Jamie's house.
537500	539400	The chair at Jamie's house.
539400	541400	I will let you be the mayor of the chair.
541400	543520	Practically in the closet at Jamie's house.
543520	548260	In the closet at Jamie's house.
548260	549260	That's right.
549260	550260	The fabulous OLR Studios.
550260	553680	My grandma in our chat room says Rob is the fabulous mayor of Walgreens.
553680	554680	Fabulous.
554680	558520	Am I really that gay, you guys?
558520	559720	Come on.
559720	562560	You are wearing a shirt with a hot dog on it.
562560	563560	No, no, no.
563560	565680	It's not just a shirt with a hot dog on it.
565680	566920	It has a rainbow too.
566920	567920	It does.
567920	568920	It does.
568920	572280	You should take a picture of my shirt, but I just don't want my fat old gut to be out
572280	573280	there.
573280	574280	It just needs glitter to make it complete.
574280	575280	Hold on.
575280	576280	I'm trying to see where I'm the mayor.
576280	577280	I'm the mayor of three places.
577280	578280	Jack in the box.
578280	579280	Jack in the box.
579280	580280	Jack in the box.
580280	581280	Jack in the box.
581280	582280	Yes.
582280	585020	A week ago, Jack in the Box sent out the most amazing coupon sheet.
585020	588980	It had all sorts of cool freebies on it.
588980	590920	Rob totally made the peewee Herman face.
590920	591920	Okay.
591920	592920	Um, let's see.
592920	593920	Oh, I'm checking in.
593920	594920	Hold on.
594920	595920	Places.
595920	598360	And I gotta be careful how I do this.
598360	599440	I don't want to tell the listeners where you live.
599440	600640	This is so too hot for the podcast.
600640	601640	Exactly.
601640	602640	I know, right?
602640	603640	This is amazing radio right now.
603640	604640	Okay.
604640	605640	Oops.
605640	606640	As Rob plays with this iPhone.
606640	607640	Live!
607640	608640	On the air.
608640	611080	Amy is the mayor, let's see, check in here.
611080	612080	Fuck yes, I'm the mayor.
612080	613080	You're the mayor of where?
613080	614080	This house.
614080	615080	Really?
615080	616080	Yes.
616080	618460	That's just pathetic.
618460	619960	At least on Foursquare.
619960	626320	I just had to check to make sure my zipper was up when she took the...
626320	629880	All Games Radio is switching between its live and on-demand feed.
629880	631600	This may take several moments.
631600	660640	All Games Radio is switching between its live and on-demand feed.
660640	661640	Tap dancing.
661640	662640	What happened?
662640	663640	I don't...
663640	664640	Be back.
664640	665640	All right.
665640	666640	Yeah, you've got hot dogs.
666640	680640	I have a pink roller skate on my shirt.
680640	694680	You do, we're free tonight.
694680	695680	I don't know how that happened.
695680	697680	I don't know how this stream came out.
697680	698680	Holly, you're tomorrow.
698680	699680	I didn't murder this stream.
699680	704680	Would you still remember me?
704680	706480	You know what we need to do?
706480	709400	You know what we need to do that we haven't done in forever and we'll do it tonight because
709400	711960	we don't have a cage match and we ended a little bit early tonight.
711960	714480	We're going to do Ask Orange Lounge.
714480	715480	Ooh!
715480	716480	Everyone.
716480	717480	Everyone.
717480	718480	Ooh.
718480	719480	Pretty good timing though.
719480	720480	Ah.
720480	721480	It is our master.
721480	722480	Ooh.
722480	726480	It decides who will go and who will stay.
726480	730480	You can ask us anything you want.
730480	731880	Within reason.
731880	732880	Ask Orange Lounge.
732880	733880	Type.
733880	734880	Message to Sky.
734880	738040	You can ask anything unreasonable, but we may not answer it.
738040	739040	That's right.
739040	740040	Ask.
740040	741400	Ask what color Misty's Undies are.
741400	742400	I'm going to do it.
742400	743400	She's wearing a ball.
743400	744400	I'm at Misty's to speak.
744400	745400	Because she'll tell you.
745400	746400	No.
746400	747400	I actually know.
747400	748400	All right.
748400	749400	Oh, really?
749400	750400	She's jacking.
750400	751400	I just slipped over.
751400	752400	Her panties were hanging out.
752400	753400	Hold on.
753400	754400	It was all for you, Rob.
754400	755400	I'm telling you.
755400	756400	Jamie's taking pictures.
756400	757400	What?
757400	758400	I can't even turn around.
758400	769720	Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.
769720	774360	All hell breaks loose.
774360	775360	I'm making shit happen.
775360	777320	I've got girls taking their pants off.
777320	778320	No, fuck it.
778320	779320	It's crazy.
779320	780320	Yeah.
780320	781320	Shit'd be crazy around here.
781320	782320	Dan, do it.
782320	783320	Rob.
783320	784320	It's not good.
784320	785320	It's fine as long as you don't see the cootie on there.
785320	786320	It's Misty.
786320	787320	It's Misty and Misty being on the cootie at the same time.
787320	791200	Do not put that on the Internet.
791200	792640	I would not put that on the Internet.
792640	793640	I'm putting it on the Internet.
793640	794640	I'm putting it on the Internet.
794640	795640	Dude, don't get our flicker taken away.
795640	796640	Look, stars.
796640	797640	It's just under us.
797640	798640	It's not like she's going beaver.
798640	799640	Now I want to watch Roger Rabbit.
799640	800640	Can we do...
800640	801640	Are you ready?
801640	802640	Ask O.L.R.
802640	803640	All right.
803640	804640	Ask O.L.R.
804640	805640	We got...
805640	806640	Look, every little red screen right there is a question.
806640	807640	So we got a lot of questions.
807640	808640	We want to see the picture of Misty's panties.
808640	809640	I'm seriously crying.
809640	810640	All right.
810640	820480	Ronma says, I demand a fucking web camera.
820480	821480	All right.
821480	822480	Can we go?
822480	823480	Can we go?
823480	824480	Yeah.
824480	825480	Top shit, Ronma.
825480	826480	All right.
826480	827480	Here we go.
827480	828480	Sing a song.
828480	829480	Can you help me out, Dan?
829480	830480	All right, guys.
830480	831480	I'm looking at the screen.
831480	832480	Let's ask O.L.R.
832480	833480	Some stupid question.
833480	835480	What will we find out tonight on O.L.R.
835480	836480	Radio?
836480	838760	Will we find out the color of Misty's panties?
838760	839760	Yes.
839760	843040	I deeply wish I had a lyric sheet because I want to sing that song.
843040	844040	I'm done.
844040	845040	O.L.R. radio song.
845040	846040	That's like if we're trying to sing about some chick's panties.
846040	847040	It is very fun.
847040	848040	I had a good time.
848040	849040	Exactly.
849040	853480	Singing the song with you.
853480	855800	The greatest thing is this part isn't recorded.
855800	856800	Oh.
856800	857800	Oh.
857800	858800	I want to listen to this again later.
858800	860120	Actually, I do have a recording running.
860120	863080	I usually just throw this out, but tonight I might save it.
863080	865160	You should save it for the DVD that we're never going to do.
865160	866520	The DVD we're never going to do.
866520	867960	We will do the DVD.
867960	869000	Free with every t-shirt.
869000	870000	We will do the DVD.
870000	871000	It's a DVD of a radio show.
871000	872560	If we ever get the damn shirts out.
872560	874560	It's just not what it's like.
874560	879360	Goldanthro asks, what color are Misty's underwear?
879360	881920	They are blue with stars on them.
881920	885080	Stars and moons.
885080	888760	But no pink diamonds or horseshoes.
888760	889760	Or Pikachu's.
889760	893880	DJ Blazkin asks, what was your first Bamani experience?
893880	895640	I'm going to defer this question to Dan.
895640	899120	What was your first Bamani experience?
899120	903000	Uh, I guess it would have been what?
903000	904400	Me bringing that burn over.
904400	907640	No, I mean, it was in the arcade for sure.
907640	908640	No, we had the-
908640	910200	Down in Milpitas.
910200	912200	That's, no, it was at Disneyland.
912200	914320	No, no, it was before that.
914320	918840	We played DDR in 99 when they were first coming out in California.
918840	919840	It was early.
919840	922640	I remember though, pretty early on, I imported the Dreamcast version for Jamie.
922640	926400	And that was probably the only version of DDR that I really bothered to play.
926400	929440	And then Julie bought a second dance pad, which I probably stole from her and never
929440	930440	gave back.
930440	931560	No, he's not kidding.
931560	933760	It's in the box.
933760	936920	We still have it in the box.
936920	937920	So yeah.
937920	940680	And if you ask her about it, she'll probably say, oh, I should get that back from you.
940680	948560	My first Bamani experience where I really enjoyed it was Guitar Freaks at Milpitas.
948560	951520	Which George got me to play because George was like, no, no, no, it's cool.
951520	952520	You'll like this.
952520	954000	And I was like, fuck that game.
954000	956120	I'm going to play Street Fighter.
956120	958800	And he was like, no, man, you got to try Guitar Freaks.
958800	960240	And I played Guitar Freaks.
960240	964960	And Guitar Freaks at first was the greatest Bamani game because you could suck at it,
964960	966760	but it didn't hack you too hard.
966760	967760	Like you could barely pass.
967760	969620	And it was like, that was the best song ever.
969620	970620	You kick ass.
970620	971620	And I'm like, I love this game.
971620	973520	It makes me feel good about myself.
973520	977080	Then like the third or fourth mix came out and it got blisteringly hard.
977080	979080	And I was like, all right, I can play Welcome to the Jungle.
979080	981080	And it's like, fuck you, you lose.
981080	986160	And I'm like, I paid for this.
986160	987520	That's what you pay Bamani games to do.
987520	988520	Make fun of you.
988520	989520	I hate that.
989520	990520	All right.
990520	993920	Rama asks, Sky, how fabulous are you?
993920	994920	Why?
994920	997920	I will, I will defer to the, to the others in studio.
997920	999080	How fabulous am I?
999080	1003680	To quote Ulala in a paraphrase, you are fab-u-less.
1003680	1005560	Hot dog.
1005560	1006560	Misty?
1006560	1007560	Boom shakalaka.
1007560	1013320	I'm not quite sure, brilliant comes to mind though.
1013320	1014320	Jaguar!
1014320	1015320	Jaguar!
1015320	1016320	Jaguar!
1016320	1025080	SSJ wonder mat asks, how did Dan propose to Jamie?
1025080	1028080	Did you propose?
1028080	1029080	Even I know this story.
1029080	1031080	If you guys, if I know this story and you two don't.
1031080	1033280	We just more like decided that we were going to do it.
1033280	1035280	I think it had something to do with pro wrestling.
1035280	1036680	No, no, no, no, no.
1036680	1039080	We were watching, we were watching UHF.
1039080	1040240	Was it UHF?
1040240	1041240	On Valentine's day.
1041240	1043520	We were watching something and there was a lot of sex involved.
1043520	1045680	And Jamie got to drink from the fire hose.
1045680	1048680	Just so you know.
1048680	1049680	Yuck.
1049680	1055240	No, but we were drinking, we were, no, this is how you knew that one day your wife would
1055240	1056240	be Jewish.
1056240	1057240	Cause we were drinking Manischewitz.
1057240	1060960	I fucking didn't know you were going to be Jewish.
1060960	1065720	I still barely, I still barely, I still don't even want to realize that.
1065720	1066720	Mazel tov!
1066720	1067720	Mazel tov!
1067720	1071520	I'm going to get seven days of presents.
1071520	1072520	All right.
1072520	1073520	Yeah.
1073520	1074520	Pencils and erasers.
1074520	1076520	I love pencils and erasers.
1076520	1078520	Dan is a real humanitarian.
1078520	1080040	He tries to see the good in everything.
1080040	1081040	Yes.
1081040	1082040	My wife's going to be Jewish.
1082040	1083040	Eight days of presents!
1083040	1084040	Eight days of presents!
1084040	1085040	Yay!
1085040	1086040	Two Christmases!
1086040	1095040	I just, I just, just now see the irony in the present.
1095040	1100040	The proposed, the, the sort of co-decision to get married over Manischewitz.
1100040	1101040	All right.
1101040	1105040	Also, S2100Matt asks, when are you all coming to New York City?
1105040	1106640	New York City?
1106640	1109720	To get a rope.
1109720	1111320	When I ain't a broke ass.
1111320	1112720	When Sister Act is on Broadway.
1112720	1113720	Yeah.
1113720	1117520	I need to accumulate some money before I can come crush.
1117520	1119360	When someone invites me for free.
1119360	1121800	I've never been to New York.
1121800	1122800	I have.
1122800	1123800	It's fun.
1123800	1124800	It's, it's pretty fantastic.
1124800	1125800	I love New York.
1125800	1126800	Especially when I'm over that flank.
1126800	1129840	This is how long ago, this is how long ago was it?
1129840	1130840	I went to New York.
1130840	1136020	Um, there were still these really two large buildings and one of them had a hole in it.
1136020	1139520	There are so many ways to die in New York City.
1139520	1140520	Thank you, Dennis Leary.
1140520	1141520	All right.
1141520	1143520	But, Rob, does that date when I went?
1143520	1145520	Start spreading the news.
1145520	1148220	Well, I've already been to Chicago, so.
1148220	1150320	I love New York.
1150320	1152940	I have the best nights out in New York City.
1152940	1153940	You know why?
1153940	1154940	Because it's never end.
1154940	1157520	I want to go to New York with Rob.
1157520	1158720	We will have the best time.
1158720	1159720	We're going to go to Broadway.
1159720	1160720	Broadway.
1160720	1161720	Next question.
1161720	1165120	We're going to go see Mama Beyond Broadway, can't we?
1165120	1166120	Yeah.
1166120	1168720	We can make OLRG finally happen and it can happen in New York.
1168720	1172280	Giove Dea is asking quite a few questions here.
1172280	1173600	Some of them have already been asked.
1173600	1174880	Uh, we'll start here.
1174880	1178040	If you had Lady Tata's, what would their names be?
1178040	1179040	Ooh, Dan.
1179040	1183480	Hey, maybe, maybe that could be Lady Gaga's sidekick, Lady Tata.
1183480	1186840	Instead of Chibi Moon, it's-
1186840	1189280	Dr. Evil and Professor Chaos.
1189280	1194720	I think mine would have, well, on that note, then I would have to name one Alejandro and
1194720	1196760	the other one, I don't know.
1196760	1197760	Enrique.
1197760	1198760	Polka Face.
1198760	1199760	Ricky Martin.
1199760	1200760	Ricky Martin.
1200760	1202760	Yeah, Ricky Martin and Alejandro.
1202760	1203760	All right.
1203760	1207640	And Giove Dea wants to know, Rob, will you be my gay boyfriend?
1207640	1211600	Have you, have we ever played that song on the show before?
1211600	1212600	Do you have a lot of money?
1212600	1218600	Uh, when it comes to being, uh, uh, the, the hag gay relationship, I am Polly.
1218600	1219600	So I, yes.
1219600	1220600	Pollyanna?
1220600	1221600	And easy.
1221600	1222600	All right.
1222600	1227280	Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, your hags love you.
1227280	1229640	And I love my hags and they're fun bags.
1229640	1230640	All right.
1230640	1235560	Dark Tetsuya says, since there probably won't be a show, can we finally run the best of
1235560	1237060	next week?
1237060	1240720	If I'm not too lazy to upload it to the all game server?
1240720	1241720	Sure.
1241720	1245200	No, I'll just get, just get on me about that midweek and I'll make sure it happens.
1245200	1247920	Uh, Toa Gak asks, oh, a game question.
1247920	1248920	What is that?
1248920	1249920	A video game question?
1249920	1252920	I thought he was going to ask me what color undies I was wearing.
1252920	1253920	All right, here we go.
1253920	1261840	Toa Gak asks, would you rather have a game with an amazing storyline, but last gen graphics
1261840	1265480	or amazing graphics and a poor storyline?
1265480	1270720	I would go with, with amazing storyline.
1270720	1274520	Like cease to mean anything after your first few hours of playing the game.
1274520	1277680	So the storyline is pretty much fine.
1277680	1279160	Are you comparing panties?
1279160	1280840	What is going on over there?
1280840	1284360	Take off your shirts.
1284360	1289440	Oh God, she did it.
1289440	1291320	Shit's getting crazy up in here.
1291320	1296000	Where's the malt liquor?
1296000	1298680	That's not my panties I was talking about.
1298680	1301280	By the way, very nice.
1301280	1302280	Malte liquor doesn't burn.
1302280	1303280	All right.
1303280	1309280	Um, I would say actually I want amazing graphics and poor storyline because you know, the spanking
1309280	1313040	game has no storyline whatsoever and that sounds better than anything else.
1313040	1320000	So what's the nice question I'm getting to it.
1320000	1321000	I'm getting to it.
1321000	1325440	Uh, Toa Gak also asked, why are there so many nicknames for boobs, boobs, knockers, tits,
1325440	1327440	fun bags, et cetera.
1327440	1328880	Um, jumblies.
1328880	1330280	Why not?
1330280	1333680	Well, how come so many-
1333680	1337040	Because breasts sound so formal.
1337040	1339800	People do stupid shit like name their car, so why not?
1339800	1346640	How come there's a song that talks about the many names of a penis?
1346640	1347640	Monty Python did it.
1347640	1348640	Halliwhacker.
1348640	1351680	Isn't it awful nice to have a penis?
1351680	1354200	Isn't it awfully good to have a dong?
1354200	1356920	Your piece of pork, your wife's best friend, your pussy or your cock.
1356920	1360200	You can wrap it up in riddance, you can stick it in your sock.
1360200	1365280	Amaze Satsuma says, can you give me a job slash occupation for Mad Libs?
1365280	1367280	Jizz Mopper.
1367280	1371640	Actually, actually I prefer Kumbucket.
1371640	1375960	Erotic Engineer.
1375960	1377920	I like Kumbucket.
1377920	1382280	Frisbee, dear strong bad, how do you type with boxing gloves on your hands?
1382280	1384480	Wrong show.
1384480	1390440	That question was totally crappy.
1390440	1391440	That's it.
1391440	1392440	That was all the questions.
1392440	1393440	I have a question, Rob.
1393440	1394440	What?
1394440	1395440	Uh oh.
1395440	1396440	What the fuck are we on?
1396440	1398280	I don't know, but that's going to do it for Ask Orange Lounge.
1398280	1399280	All games radio.
1399280	1402280	Who said we need to be on anything?
1402280	1404280	I'm not even on Bikin' It.
1404280	1407640	That's all the time we have for Ask Orange Lounge.
1407640	1410800	We hope you learn something tonight on Orange Lounge Radio.
1410800	1415160	All the women wear blue underwear.
1415160	1416160	That's all I learned.
1416160	1418920	And now I'm scarred for the rest of the night.
1418920	1422480	Good for you.
1422480	1424480	P.S. Jizz Mopper.
1424480	1428560	All right, Rama's asking a serious question.
1428560	1429960	Actually, this is a serious question.
1429960	1430960	Uh oh.
1430960	1431960	Downer.
1431960	1432960	All right, Rama say- Thanks, Rama.
1432960	1433960	Serious question.
1433960	1434960	We can't get a serious question.
1434960	1435960	I don't think I've ever told this on a show.
1435960	1436960	Are we really going to do this?
1436960	1437960	Sure, why not?
1437960	1438960	Do it.
1438960	1440760	Rama says, when did you come out of the closet and how did your family take it?
1440760	1444920	Dan, do you want to answer this?
1444920	1446920	They knew when I was young.
1446920	1452560	No, in Dan's case, when they finally removed the deadbolt and he came out blinking into
1452560	1455200	the sunlight for the first time in 13 years.
1455200	1456880	They were all surprisingly accepting.
1456880	1457880	Here's the deal.
1457880	1458880	Here's the deal.
1458880	1462040	My mom asked me for like three months straight every day, are you gay?
1462040	1463040	Are you gay?
1463040	1464040	Are you gay?
1464040	1465040	And like, it kind of got annoying.
1465040	1466280	Like I was like, cause this is what it was.
1466280	1470720	I didn't like the fact, you know, cause I had a tough time in high school cause I
1470720	1474480	got called fag and all that stuff a lot in high school and I didn't really like it.
1474480	1477080	And I didn't really know I was gay then cause I was just trying to be normal.
1477080	1479380	You know, have a girlfriend and you know, this is how we roll.
1479380	1482560	You know, I'm, I'm a hot stud playing the clarinet in the marching band, right?
1482560	1487840	So you know, and trying to do that whole thing, I didn't really want to admit I was gay because
1487840	1490000	I didn't want all those people to be right.
1490000	1492880	But then when I kind of realized I was gay, like I, that was one of the first things I
1492880	1493880	had to conquer.
1493880	1496880	So when my mom joined in on it, I really didn't appreciate it.
1496880	1501000	Probably one day it actually kind of exploded in a, yes, are you happy?
1501000	1502000	Now leave me alone.
1502000	1504520	And she ran off to her room to cry for the rest of the day.
1504520	1505600	But here's why she did it.
1505600	1507120	I found this out years later.
1507120	1511800	I had some friends over one night and she actually overheard one of my lady friends
1511800	1516260	at the time, um, I almost said her name, but I guess I shouldn't, on the phone, uh, talking
1516260	1520080	to her mom and she overheard her say to her mom, no, don't worry.
1520080	1521080	They're all gay guys.
1521080	1522080	It's going to be fine.
1522080	1525760	So my mom actually found out because of my loud mouth female friend.
1525760	1527080	So she knew that whole time.
1527080	1529040	She just wanted me to tell her bitches.
1529040	1530040	All right.
1530040	1535520	But then the next day she came out with her eyes all puffy and you know, she's like, I
1535520	1537680	just want you to know I still love you.
1537680	1540360	And I've known since you were four.
1540360	1544120	And I'm like, how do you know when I didn't know until I was like 17, how do you know
1544120	1545520	when you're four?
1545520	1551040	Because mothers always, we had a kid in my family, you know, but my, my eldest cousin
1551040	1557600	who was gay and I never, you know, I never put two and two into it.
1557600	1561440	It was just, he was who he was, but my folks and people in my family were always like,
1561440	1564560	we knew from the time he was a young, young boy that he was gay.
1564560	1568580	I just, I always, there's a part of me that doesn't like that though, because it insinuates
1568580	1570600	that being gay, you act a certain way.
1570600	1573280	And I don't think that's true.
1573280	1578280	As I sit here on my legs crossed tapping on the table, but there's not like you can't,
1578280	1579280	okay.
1579280	1581440	You can't act gay if you're straight, you can't act straight if you're gay.
1581440	1586240	But what is straight acting and gay acting?
1586240	1589000	There's not, you know, you know what I'm talking about.
1589000	1590520	You fucking know what I'm talking about.
1590520	1595960	I do, but I understand I'm not trying to perpetuate the stereotype or anything, but like I looked
1595960	1602040	at Rob when I first met you and I was like, wow, and you're not wearing like feather boas
1602040	1603040	and shit.
1603040	1619200	I didn't come in and go, hi Dan, Dan's gaydar has improved because I wasn't threatening.
1619200	1623280	I was probably, I probably had my arm around Jamie and we were skipping and Dan was like,
1623280	1629840	somehow this is not threatening to me.
1629840	1637600	Dan knows that I have complete and utter devotion to the gays, the truth is, you know, I realize
1637600	1641480	that any who oppose me can be summarily dealt with.
1641480	1642960	All right.
1642960	1648320	Do you know if I told my mom about that I had a girlfriend before?
1648320	1649320	Really?
1649320	1650320	You know what she said?
1650320	1651320	What?
1651320	1652320	I don't need to hear that.
1652320	1653320	Yeah, me either.
1653320	1654320	You do?
1654320	1655320	All right.
1655320	1657800	Well, here's the, here's the other thing that's important because my mom said, and this is
1657800	1661880	very important, important part of the story is my mom said, I called your grandma and
1661880	1664240	I told her, I'm like, why are you telling everybody?
1664240	1667280	She's like, no, I want you to know what your grandma said, because it meant a lot.
1667280	1670080	I told your grandma that you were gay and I'm like, what'd she say?
1670080	1675120	And my grandma said, so what?
1675120	1677120	So rest in peace, grandma Shaw.
1677120	1678120	All right.
1678120	1683680	Uh, anyhow, um, Dan, I do miss your cousin because I got along really well with your
1683680	1684680	cousin.
1684680	1693280	Uh, lastly, God, it's like the all gay OLR DJ Blaiskin asks, what do you think about
1693280	1695440	prop eight being put in the fire?
1695440	1700680	Um, obviously, obviously it needed to happen and it's a good thing.
1700680	1704520	But the thing is, is that, you know, because of the way it happened, that there are people
1704520	1707240	out there who do still want to fight it.
1707240	1708240	It's not over.
1708240	1712320	I just, I would, there's a part of me that really hopes the stay gets lifted, but honestly
1712320	1715100	this issue just isn't over until the Supreme court decides on it.
1715100	1719000	And I am a little nervous about the Supreme court decides, are we going to take away next?
1719000	1725440	I just hope that history and things that happened in, you know, loving V Virginia and some of
1725440	1729480	these other things that happened in the past will kind of set the presidents for overturning
1729480	1731580	property at the Supreme court level.
1731580	1736540	But I worry there's unfortunately that many ignoramus people in the world who for whatever
1736540	1738440	reason want to have their say in my life.
1738440	1742280	The moment they bring the 14th amendment into it, you know, it becomes an even bigger issue.
1742280	1747720	And I kind of think that some of those pro prop eight people might actually have more
1747720	1753820	to fear if it goes to the, to the Supreme court, because then if, if this, they uphold
1753820	1759240	the ruling that, yes, this is unconstitutional, that's national precedent.
1759240	1760240	National precedent.
1760240	1762380	There's a bunch of scared ass insecure fuckers.
1762380	1763380	I know.
1763380	1772160	It's just like, what I assure you, I don't want to have my wedding in a church and I
1772160	1777480	am not going to sue any church that doesn't want to have my wedding because I'm not, well,
1777480	1779920	I just, people can do whatever they want to do.
1779920	1782240	No, here's what I have to do, whatever you want to do.
1782240	1784520	Let me do what I want to do here, Rob.
1784520	1785520	Here's what I have to say.
1785520	1786520	What is it?
1786520	1787520	Okay.
1787520	1793700	If you know, the, the fundamental Christians want to use Leviticus as their standing point
1793700	1797440	for saying, you know, which is actually in Jewish law, man shall not lay with another
1797440	1798700	man like a woman.
1798700	1800840	That just means that I guess you can't have boobs or something.
1800840	1806200	Um, but anyway, if, if the Christians want to use Leviticus, they also have to keep kosher
1806200	1810800	and grow out their beards and wear tall black hats like the Hasidic do.
1810800	1812760	I put the fun in fundamentalist.
1812760	1817600	Well it's not even, here's the thing, quote the Bible all you want or any religious text,
1817600	1823260	but there's like an amendment in the constitution that says freedom of religion, meaning I am
1823260	1824760	free of your religion.
1824760	1826840	Well see, and that's, that's my other point.
1826840	1835400	I mean, my point is that if they're trying to use, if they're trying to use a law when
1835400	1842760	they admittedly don't follow the laws themselves, then that's just being hypocritical.
1842760	1843760	Here's the end of the thing.
1843760	1848040	I am encouraged by the fact that folks our age, and I see a lot of people in chat going,
1848040	1849200	I have a gay friend who cares.
1849200	1850200	I don't care.
1850200	1855880	You know, and that, that seems to be the attitude of most 18 to 35 year olds in this day and
1855880	1856880	age.
1856880	1857880	They just need to vote.
1857880	1862640	So the good news is when we're the old farts on the Supreme Court making the decisions,
1862640	1863640	this will be over.
1863640	1864640	Yeah.
1864640	1867520	We're just going to have to wait for the ignorant people to pass on.
1867520	1873260	Well, I mean, if you, if you take a look at the civil rights movement, the 14th amendment
1873260	1879920	passed a hundred years before Brown versus the Board of Education and the, and the Montgomery
1879920	1885040	boycott, the Montgomery bus boycott with Rosa Parks.
1885040	1889680	And so how many of us our age look back on that and go, God, they were so dumb.
1889680	1891760	Like what was the big fucking deal?
1891760	1893760	Like when, right.
1893760	1894760	Yeah.
1894760	1899800	But when the Plessy case went, there's people who were old, old, you know, were young at
1899800	1905500	that time who disagreed, who were older at that time and voted in the new way.
1905500	1907080	That's you're exactly right.
1907080	1910160	Our history is teaching us right now that eventually all of those people with the big
1910160	1912160	stick up their ass are going to be dead.
1912160	1916280	And guess who gets to step in?
1916280	1921760	So even if I'm not around to see it, I know someday it will change.
1921760	1922760	And that's that.
1922760	1923760	We'll be able to marry Pikachu.
1923760	1927560	But you know, if anyone is still listening, is anyone still listening?
1927560	1930400	Yeah, we actually have a few people still listening believe it or not.
1930400	1933900	I'm just saying if anyone is still listening, make sure that when the opportunity comes
1933900	1938000	up for you to vote and important issues like this, that you do it because I was watching
1938000	1942020	the voter turnout during the whole Prop 8 thing and I was completely dismayed.
1942020	1946400	They were, we were really relying on, you know, the Berkeley area and you know, the
1946400	1951760	voter turnout was only something like 52% and it could have completely turned the whole
1951760	1956120	thing because the vote was 52 to 49.
1956120	1960400	Just if the rest of the voting population had put in the effort, it wouldn't have even
1960400	1961400	been an issue.
1961400	1963400	So, I'm just saying.
1963400	1967360	This was a very interesting election year though, because either way the tide had gone,
1967360	1969480	you were going to have a minority in the White House.
1969480	1973080	Either you had a racial minority or you had the sexual minority.
1973080	1975940	You would have had one crazy ass fucking woman in the White House, but you would have had
1975940	1977880	a woman in the White House, you know?
1977880	1983080	You know what, you know what, I think my problem with Hillary is that she, uh,
1983080	1984080	No, I don't.
1984080	1985080	I'm not talking to her.
1985080	1986080	I'm talking Sarah Palin.
1986080	1993400	Hillary doesn't win the primaries, but despite whatever, whatever happened, you would have
1993400	1995080	had a minority in the White House when we were there.
1995080	2003240	I thought, I thought it was two minorities right there, two minorities in one, and that's
2003240	2004240	going to be the bill.
2004240	2005240	This is what we need.
2005240	2009360	What we need, Rob, is a Jewish black woman.
2009360	2012600	What we need is just someone who's not a dick.
2012600	2014480	Like that's just all I want.
2014480	2016680	And I, I'm not going to get too political.
2016680	2023560	That means I'll never be president, because I put the dick in the dictator.
2023560	2026480	No, I, I, we need Renna.
2026480	2027480	We need Renna.
2027480	2028480	President cat.
2028480	2029480	That's right.
2029480	2030480	That's what we need.
2030480	2031480	President cat.
2031480	2032480	You will meow this mess.
2032480	2033840	All right.
2033840	2036520	Should we declare nuclear war?
2036520	2041080	Would you like to play a game?
2041080	2043040	Let's go to the fortune cookie message of the day.
2043040	2044120	This show is getting too deep.
2044120	2047480	I mean, this is just, this is supposed to be a haha funny show.
2047480	2048480	We sung the thing.
