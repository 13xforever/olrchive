With your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky, and Lowkey

00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Tonight, August 8th, 2010, Kinect may not be available for Indie games. Soon you can play video games with your eyes.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And a warning for all Starcraft 2 players.

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Orange Lounge Radio

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Hello my friends and welcome to episode number 377 of Orange Lounge Radio.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
We are that video game talk show where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
My name is Rob Roberts. I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host, the one and only, knocking stuff over.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
She reaches for her mic. Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
How you doing? Why are you so angry? Why are you mad though?

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Because I made a boo boo and this thing is trying to get rid of this stupid thing.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
You made a boo boo? Please, let's revel in what mistakes you've made.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I got that security shield thing because I hit space.

14
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
So my security shield, is that one of those spammy spam spammers programs?

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
It's called a rogue anti-spyware when it's really the worst kind of spyware there is.

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
So it's spyware disguised as anti-spyware. It's the type of thing my mom would have all over her computer.

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Yeah, and I'm trying to get rid of it without having to reboot.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
So word of warning to those folks out there. Watch what you hit the space bar on.

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I know right. Just because it looks like your windows doesn't mean it's right.

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
And I was actually right in the middle of typing to somebody on AIM when it popped up.

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I hate that. Because I use the space bar for everything.

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Right, of course. Alright, not joining us tonight is Tech Master Loki.

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Of course, if you were listening to last week's show, he had a baby last week.

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
So he's on baby leave for a little while. We'll let you know when he's going to come back.

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
But filling in for Loki in the meantime, not replacing Loki because Loki is irreplaceable.

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
But filling in for Loki, say hello to, we've missed this guy too because it's been a while since he's been on the show.

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Say hello to Dan the Man. How you doing Dan?

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm kind of on the show like every week or two.

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Well you do drop in and say hello, but you don't sit in on the show like you're doing tonight.

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I get to sit at my own desk.

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I know, instead of Loki taking up the chair, it's you.

32
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Awesome.

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
So the listeners heard you had a rough week last week. How you doing though?

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Not really.

35
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Yeah?

36
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I feel like before.

37
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'm sorry, not this last week.

38
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It was last week.

39
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Whatever.

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'm good.

41
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You're good. Feeling good?

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Yeah.

43
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Alright. Are you feeling beautiful?

44
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Of course.

45
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I just had to throw him a curve ball.

46
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And awesome.

47
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Alright. Dan is going to be helping out while Loki's on vacation because it's really easy for Dan to help out because he lives here.

48
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
So, you know, he's usually pretty readily available.

49
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
So Dan will be filling in until Loki decides he's going to come back, which I hope he does decide to come back at some point.

50
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Because I got to admit, there's that part of me that's always wondered.

51
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You know, when Loki has this baby, is he going to want to do a little radio show on the internet anymore?

52
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Or is he going to worry that the stuff he says on this show his kid might hear someday? I don't know.

53
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
That would be awfully pathetic.

54
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
No, I'm positive he will come back, but he can take all the time he needs.

55
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Alright. Well, we'll get back to Dan in a little while.

56
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
But I want to introduce somebody else to you guys because we have a guest in the studio tonight too.

57
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
And we're really glad to have her.

58
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It's the second time she's been on the show and she probably would be one of the few guests that come.

59
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I can only think of maybe two or three guests that have traveled further than she has to be on the show.

60
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Say hello, everybody, to Misty is here tonight.

61
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Howdy, y'all.

62
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
How you doing, Misty?

63
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'm doing good.

64
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Alright, excellent.

65
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
So, let's see, for those that haven't, when was the last time you were on the show?

66
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It was about a year ago-ish?

67
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
No, due to stuff happening last time, we never even got to do a pre-taped segment.

68
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
So this is my first time, just my second time being in Dan and Jamie's house.

69
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I thought for some reason you were on a show. Oh, we did like a pre-taped thing or something, huh?

70
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
We didn't even get to that last time.

71
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Really?

72
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Really.

73
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I thought you should have been on a show before.

74
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Yeah, Rob.

75
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Yeah.

76
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Well, okay, after 377 episodes, they all start to blur a little bit, okay? Give me a break.

77
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Alright, well anyway, then welcome to the show at BSMA.

78
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
But you've called in before and all that good stuff, so hopefully the listeners know you.

79
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,000
And also, a lot of listeners may have not heard you because you don't call in every week.

80
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
But you have a presence on the website, and you've been following the Twitters, and I know you've always been a big supporter of the show.

81
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
So thank you, first off, for being such a supporter of OLR over the years.

82
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
When did you first start listening? It's been a while, right?

83
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Episode 91.

84
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Wow, that's some time ago. Alright.

85
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,000
What is the best thing about Orange Lounge Radio, you think? Just to inflate our egos a little bit?

86
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Again, it's back more toward the DDR in random days. Of course, the tangents that pop up now still make it worth it.

87
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You know, I've kind of heard that, that even though we're not a music-based game show anymore, kind of like the community that still lives on because of that, I've definitely heard is like a thing that people like about the show.

88
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:28,000
And certainly, you know, as much as I've hated on a lot of the recent games that that same company's put out that gave us DDR, obviously the show wouldn't exist if it weren't for that.

89
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:36,000
And for that, I will always be thankful, and they'll always be a part of me that wants to play those games as crappy as they are these days.

90
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Alright, anyhow, so Misty will be joining us, and we'll talk to her a little more a little later.

91
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,000
But we're going to get into a little bit of how was your gaming week, because we always start off the show talking about our gaming weeks and what we've been playing.

92
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:53,000
So let's go over to DarkSakura. What have you been playing besides Download, Add-A-Wear, and Spybot as quickly as possible?

93
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Well, I played some Ragnarok and Star Trek online, as usual, and then I made Dan play stuff for me so I could watch, because my hand still hurts a lot.

94
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Oh, that's right. You still have the hand thing going on.

95
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
But it's not seeping joint fluid anymore.

96
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Yeah, actually, I can stand to look at it now. I get very squeamish with the whole blood thing.

97
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You can touch it.

98
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I don't want to touch it. I don't want to touch it. Why?

99
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Because it's not gross.

100
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I meant to slide the hole, not the hole.

101
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Oh, I touched the hole.

102
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Rob touched the hole.

103
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I touched Jamie's hole. Sorry, Dan.

104
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Alright.

105
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
No problem.

106
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Alright.

107
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Oh, Rob.

108
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
At least the hole's in your hand and not in your head.

109
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
But Dan played the games for me so that I could watch and then go, what?

110
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Alright. Well, Dan, we'll skip on over to you. What kind of games have you been playing this week?

111
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I've been playing Hydra Thunder Hurricane, which is awesome.

112
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Why is it awesome? Because I downloaded it and I was like, this just isn't the same.

113
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Because I love jet boat racing. I don't understand why, but it's awesome.

114
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I can, like, jump my boat, break things, win races, go online, get my ass kicked. It's amazing.

115
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Why is it that everybody online is better than me? Like, I can't figure this out.

116
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Like, it doesn't matter what game I play.

117
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,000
And is it just me, guys? Whenever I go online and play a game online, I am always in last place.

118
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Unless it's not.

119
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,000
See, she didn't have a mic. Room spontaneously combusts into laughter in a while.

120
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
That's the way Mystique works.

121
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Yeah, she's Mystique. Stop it. We're doing a radio show.

122
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
She doesn't care.

123
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Dan and Jamie's friend, Mystique, she's funny and she ran in here and just whispered,

124
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
you know, I said, why do I always come in last? She just came in here and whispered,

125
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
it's because you're gay. And that's why everybody started laughing.

126
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Because she came in here and gave the thumbs up. So anyway, we got to get her mic.

127
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
We got to get a wireless mic for Mystique so that way when she runs in and out, we'll still get her.

128
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Anyway, where was I? See, now I got lost.

129
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Thanks Mystique for derailing the whole goddamn show.

130
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
We're talking about my gaming week.

131
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Oh, yes.

132
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
We decided to lament the fact that you suck at games online.

133
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Yes, I suck at video games online. Why is it Halo? Last place.

134
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I would think partially because the only game I'll typically play online is Rock Band 2.

135
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I do okay with the music games. DDR, like UltraMix back in the day.

136
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I would kick your ass at UltraMix. I will.

137
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
But there were some very scary people that could even beat me.

138
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
But that's one of the few.

139
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
But like, okay, Blur. Have you played Blur? The online racing game?

140
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Have you played it online at all against other people?

141
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
No.

142
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Usually I do really shitty, but one time, one time I actually won a race.

143
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I won a race against like 10 other people and I was so excited.

144
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I'll admit, I felt a little tingle down there.

145
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I was so excited.

146
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Wow.

147
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
And that's like the only time that's ever happened.

148
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Alright.

149
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
And that new downloadable Castlevania.

150
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
How is the new downloadable Castlevania?

151
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Well, I only played the trial, so it's interesting.

152
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:16,000
It seems like it'd probably be really cool with a crew of people, but by yourself, not very fun.

153
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I've heard it's an awesome multiplayer game, but I have yet to experience the multiplayer.

154
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Did you download it?

155
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I checked out the demo for a little bit and I played it at E3 a few months ago.

156
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
And when I was at E3, I was like, this game's kind of weird, but it's kind of interesting and fun.

157
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
And when I downloaded it, I was like, yeah, this is still kind of weird.

158
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
The thing I don't like about the game, and I don't like games that do this,

159
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:45,000
is that the game really just throws you in with no description whatsoever.

160
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
And look, guys, I realize most Atari 2600 games and NES games back in the day did the same thing.

161
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Like Mario doesn't tell you what to do.

162
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
But games were less complicated back then.

163
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
It takes a second.

164
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
And there's so many buttons and stuff.

165
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Usually I need a little bit of a tutorial, but all I see in Castlevania is boss.

166
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
And I'm like, okay, I'll go do that.

167
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
But then every time I think I know the way to the boss, there's a fucking wall there or something.

168
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I'm like, why didn't I see that when I was looking at the whole map?

169
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
It seems to be my new four people who are going to download it, it'd be worth my money.

170
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
But is it 15?

171
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It is 15. That's where it's at now.

172
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
If it was 10 bucks, it'd be almost an automatic anyway.

173
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
The $15 thing, except for a game like Hurricane, which is obviously an undertaking,

174
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
it seems to me like that's a little excessive for Castlevania.

175
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
All right, I'm going to go to the chat room, because chat rooms are filling up with comments here.

176
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
chat.orangelandsradio.com

177
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
We love our chatters, and every week they join us here.

178
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Let's see, TigerClaw is going to start us off tonight saying, in response to the

179
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Why Do I Always Lose Online,

180
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Sky, it's simple, they've been playing the game a whole lot.

181
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
If you're someone who plays casual, you'll get your ass kicked online.

182
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Yeah, pretty much.

183
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
He also goes on to say, I haven't played Starcraft 2 online yet,

184
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
knowing I'll just get my ass whooped.

185
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I want to play it online, but only doing co-op games.

186
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
That's kind of how I feel about a lot of that stuff, too.

187
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
But yet, I play World of Warcraft, and I actually really enjoy PVP and World of Warcraft.

188
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
But that's, World of Warcraft's not like other games.

189
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
It's really not. Games like that, their MMOs are in a little bubble of their own.

190
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
They're not like other stuff.

191
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Leo Shannon in our chat says, Rob, try BlazBlue, whatever you want to say, CS.

192
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
They have a beginner mode that works with online mode.

193
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
You can button mash your way to victory.

194
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Sounds good to me. There you go.

195
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:41,000
And Amaze Satsuma chimes in and says,

196
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
New Castlevania does have a good multiplayer game.

197
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
There you go.

198
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Hello? Hi.

199
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
And now your mic is ruined again.

200
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
How about this?

201
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I was explaining to Dan why we can't have more than three people in the chat room.

202
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Because the moment number four pops in, boot.

203
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Is Misty on 3G, though? Are you on 3G?

204
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
No, I'm on Wi-Fi.

205
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Can you switch to 3G or will your app stop working?

206
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It's all Wi-Fi for mine. Remember, I have no fancy iPhone.

207
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Oh, that's right. You have an iPhone.

208
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
It looks like an iPhone.

209
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
That's right. I'll live.

210
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Dan, you can look over here.

211
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
It's always there.

212
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Anyway, chat.orangeonshade.com if you want to chat with the host.

213
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Except for Dan, because he can't get in.

214
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Screw you people.

215
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
You have a mic. Why do you need IRC?

216
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
So I can see what people are saying.

217
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
He wants to know when people are talking shit about him.

218
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
If people are talking shit, I'll let you know.

219
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Holy crap.

220
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
You okay there?

221
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Oh, I was running Hijack This to see if I could find it,

222
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
but there's way too many things that are running.

223
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Jamie's computer is super broken.

224
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Jamie has downloaded like seven anti-spyware programs

225
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
since the time I sat down in this chair.

226
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I just downloaded Hijack This and Attawear, but haven't rebooted.

227
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
She doesn't just want to remove the spyware from her computer.

228
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
She wants to obliterate it.

229
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
She wants to wipe it off the base of the planet.

230
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
You will die.

231
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I've already deleted a whole bunch of its DLLs

232
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
and stopped the process from running.

233
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Because Jamie steals so much crap off the internet.

234
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Jamie's going to show up at the front door of the company

235
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
that made this with her iron fists.

236
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Somebody's going to get face pummeled.

237
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I want her not to go to the porn websites.

238
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
But no!

239
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
For the record, I was going to a site that explained

240
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
the history of gay people in the Old Testament.

241
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Porn!

242
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Okay.

243
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I don't know why you're giving her shit about it, Dan.

244
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
You made her download it.

245
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I wanted to read the article and instead it did this shit to me.

246
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I was trying to be conscientious!

247
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I get my porn from other websites.

248
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I get my porn from kicking you.

249
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Alright, anything else that you played this week, Dan?

250
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I played a bunch of Genesis games

251
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
because my wife was like, play Genesis games!

252
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Yeah, I heard there was Sega Night last night.

253
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Yeah, I don't know.

254
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
All I know is Jamie wanted me to get beat

255
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
because she picked every one of the hardest Genesis games

256
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
and was like, play this, play this.

257
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Finally she goes back for another batch of games

258
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
and I'm like, if she comes back with Gunstar Heroes

259
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I'm going to shoot her.

260
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
And she came back with Gunstar Heroes.

261
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
What was the other game that I brought?

262
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I don't remember what the other one was.

263
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Oh, no, it wasn't Midnight Resistance.

264
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
It was something else difficult.

265
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
But the games that I brought out were...

266
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Well, it was Robo-Lest and Silpheed.

267
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Every freaking game, yeah.

268
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Silpheed, Robo-Lest, Shattered Answer,

269
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Strider, which is normally a game that I would just

270
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
dominate without even thinking about it.

271
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
And tonight, or last night, every cheap death

272
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I was like, son of a bitch!

273
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Oh, terrible stuff.

274
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Didn't you beat Strider with your eyes closed once

275
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
or something crazy? What was it?

276
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I've beaten Strider every which way.

277
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Seriously.

278
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
And last night, like I said, I continued three times,

279
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
didn't finish the game.

280
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I was just like, all right.

281
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
That's plenty of that.

282
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
For the record, it was two stages.

283
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Genesis does what I don't.

284
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
For the record, it was two stages that I beat

285
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
with my eyes closed.

286
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I have no idea what you're talking about.

287
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
When I was a kid, I could beat 8-1

288
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
on Super Mario Brothers with my eyes closed

289
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
because I had the level timed.

290
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I could get through 8-1 without stopping,

291
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
but I couldn't do it with my eyes closed.

292
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
But I could do it continuously running through the whole thing.

293
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I couldn't do that anymore.

294
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I can still get through it running.

295
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I couldn't do it blindfolded anymore

296
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
because I don't remember the timing.

297
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
All right.

298
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I want to know what crazy accomplishments

299
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
our chatters have accomplished in video games.

300
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Like, just weird shit.

301
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Like, you beat a game. Okay, great.

302
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Yeah, we all beat games.

303
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I want to know, like, you beat a game

304
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
while hanging upside down,

305
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
getting water shot at your face or something.

306
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I want to know what crazy video game accomplishments

307
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
you guys have done.

308
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
That would be fun to know about.

309
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
It was kind of nonexistent.

310
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I think I pretty much hit on everything I played this week.

311
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I had a really busy week,

312
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
so I didn't get a lot done,

313
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
and I really didn't get a lot done with the podcast,

314
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
so I apologize to that. I'll talk about that in a minute.

315
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
But I didn't play a lot outside of Warcraft.

316
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I'll give you guys a Warcraft update

317
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
for those that care, all two of you.

318
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Shut up.

319
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Our guild is now in Icecrown Citadel

320
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
because remember, our guild is about six months

321
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
behind all the other guilds

322
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
because we didn't start raiding

323
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
about six weeks ago, probably, at this point.

324
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
We're now in Icecrown Citadel.

325
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
You were raiding, but it wasn't lairs.

326
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
We're in Icecrown Citadel now,

327
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
and we took out the fourth boss, Sauerfang.

328
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
And that's how far we are right now.

329
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Sauerfang.

330
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Oh, I was like, if it's Sauerfang?

331
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
That guy had to be like...

332
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
It's with you, it's not an O.

333
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
But I was saying, if it was Sauer,

334
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
then I'd be like, okay, what's gonna be my

335
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
fear-instilling nickname?

336
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Well, he got Bloodfang,

337
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Evilfang, and this one's Darkfang.

338
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I guess I'll go with Sauer.

339
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Sauerfang.

340
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
It's not like Sauerfang, it's Sauerfang.

341
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Sauerfang. That sounds like a dog.

342
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Sauerfang.

343
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
So yeah, that was the ICC accomplishment.

344
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I am on number four, by the way.

345
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Number four.

346
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Removal program number four.

347
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
The AVG is good.

348
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
It's all the stuff that I should have put on here to begin with.

349
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
So you know what the problem with this whole thing is?

350
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I'm gonna have to fix your computer.

351
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I fixed your computer

352
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
when you had that stupid thing that kept popping up.

353
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
You remember that one registry thing that would keep

354
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
replicating itself every time you deleted the

355
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
registry file unless you removed yourself

356
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
from the internet? No, because I really try not to

357
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
get that shit on my computer.

358
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Everybody got it. And I removed it off Dan's.

359
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I have no idea what you're talking about.

360
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I just had a video card explode on me once.

361
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
That was really... I don't get a lot of spot...

362
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Well, my WoW account got hacked

363
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
about... when was it? It was when I was in Disneyland

364
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
October, so it was about

365
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
almost a year ago now.

366
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Shut up.

367
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
My WoW account got hacked.

368
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
And I was like, how the hell

369
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
did that happen? Did somebody get my password?

370
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
What kind of keylogger got on my computer?

371
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Who else has my password? And then I figured

372
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
it out. You know how I am pretty convinced

373
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
somebody got my Warcraft password?

374
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Because I used to play on my ex's computer.

375
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
And he was dumb enough to get all that spyware stuff.

376
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
So that's how they got my password

377
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
because I made the mistake of playing on someone

378
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
else's computer and it doesn't know better.

379
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
So, word of warning, everybody.

380
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I do think that I've already uninstalled

381
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
World of Warcraft from my computer.

382
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Even though I probably won't ever play it again,

383
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I don't want them to get my account.

384
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Because they would have stole your World of Warcraft account.

385
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
They would have stole all the gold

386
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Rob gave me.

387
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Oh, while I'm ex-bashing here on the show,

388
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
can I tell you something else I realized?

389
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Which one?

390
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
It actually has to do with gaming.

391
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
You know which one. The one...

392
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Oh!

393
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
There.

394
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Because I don't want to

395
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
do slanderous or anything.

396
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Here's the thing. I actually realized this today

397
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
while I was driving down and listening to another podcast.

398
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
You know how I've been really afraid to play

399
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Starcraft 2 because I think it's too hard.

400
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
And I'm not really good at RTS games.

401
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I'm really worried that the game is not...

402
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I'm not going to be able to do well at the game.

403
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Well, I realized that my ex

404
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
was a big Starcraft fan.

405
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
His online name was actually based out of the

406
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Starcraft universe and everything. And it really hit me.

407
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
If that dumb fuck can play

408
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Starcraft, I can play Starcraft!

409
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
So I'm going to go out and buy Starcraft 2 tomorrow.

410
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I'm Jim Brainer 1262,

411
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
hardcore Starcraft fan.

412
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Well,

413
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
you were still supposed to bring me something, Rob.

414
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Oh,

415
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I haven't been home.

416
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I haven't been home.

417
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
If you put it on the easiest setting, by the way,

418
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Starcraft 2 is like, hyper easy.

419
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Is it really?

420
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Like, die!

421
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
BlackWolf, our good pal who does the show before us

422
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
here at All Games Radio, which by the way, I don't remember

423
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
if I said this, but we do tape live every week at

424
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
www.allgames.com right after

425
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Bobby BlackWolf's show.

426
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Bobby BlackWolf says casual mode

427
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
is reasonable, Rob.

428
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
There you go. I guess that's cool.

429
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Oh yeah, in my gaming week. I got Starcraft 2 last week.

430
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
How was it? You like it?

431
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Can I play it? Am I smart enough to play it?

432
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Yeah, that's what I said. It's not very hard.

433
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
If you play it on casual.

434
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
There's too many screenshots and stuff.

435
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I'm like, there's too many units on the screen.

436
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I can't handle this. It's too much.

437
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I'm just, I'm weird, you guys.

438
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Are you seeing this?

439
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I don't play a lot of RTS.

440
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
This thing is amazing. Yeah, Jamie got that out when you were gone last week.

441
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I was thumbing through it and I turned everything upside down and put it back.

442
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Sweet.

443
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Let's see.

444
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I was asking for gaming accomplishments

445
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
and I didn't see a lot, but I do see

446
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
SalaciousPop in our chat room

447
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
says, I got up to stage

448
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
5 and Battletoads on one set of lives once.

449
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Once. That's an accomplishment.

450
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
That is an accomplishment. Also, oh wow.

451
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Also, I

452
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
beat the original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

453
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
NES game twice

454
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
with all four turtles alive.

455
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
That's pretty hardcore.

456
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Yeah, that's pretty

457
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
tricky. That's a tough game.

458
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
The technodrome was actually a really

459
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
difficult boss.

460
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Alright. Tigerclaw in chat

461
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
says, yeah, I play in casual mode, but the game is still

462
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
kicking my ass though. It's all about trial and error.

463
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
If you fuck up, just restart. See, Tigerclaw

464
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
and I need to play co-op because it's

465
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
like the blind leading the blind. That would be awesome.

466
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Rage quit the team.

467
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Rage quit the team. Yes. Rage quit together.

468
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Alright.

469
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I have my first rage quit, Rob.

470
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Rage quit?

471
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
In Star Trek Online? Really?

472
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Because my shit got blew up.

473
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
And I was like, fuck this. Exit.

474
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I rage quit playing Genesis games last night.

475
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Alright.

476
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Ask Misty. Misty, I don't want to neglect you

477
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
and your gaming week. How was your gaming week?

478
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Between work

479
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
and because of my

480
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
tendency to do a shift on two hours

481
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
of sleep and then crash after I get home.

482
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Basically non-existent. Had some

483
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
obligatory Rock Band 2 time.

484
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
But

485
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
for some reason I... Don't forget to

486
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
talk in that mic, hon, or we can't hear you.

487
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
But basically non-existent.

488
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Rock Band 2.

489
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Bought some stupid Rainbow Unicorn

490
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
game. I blame Rob.

491
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Rainbow Unicorn game is awesome.

492
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Robot Unicorn Attack on iPhone.

493
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
What about the one where you get

494
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
ass, is it?

495
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Pink anus. That's on Steam.

496
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I have that game. I know you do.

497
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Really? Yes.

498
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
There's a unicorn game and there's a...

499
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
How many times have I told the story on this show already?

500
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
There's a mineral or something that you use

501
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
to like, I don't know, perfect your unicorns.

502
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Polish their horns, we'll say.

503
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
That is...

504
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Anus. A-E-N-U-S.

505
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
So you collect pink anus

506
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
to polish their horns, basically.

507
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I knew that, I just wanted to hear you say it.

508
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Okay.

509
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Alright, anyway.

510
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Alright,

511
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
anything else for your gaming week, Misty?

512
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Not really.

513
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
And by the way, you took a flight

514
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
out here for the first time, right? When was your first time

515
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
flying? Yes it was. How was it?

516
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Was it that bad?

517
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Surprisingly,

518
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
the only time I was really that nervous was during

519
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
takeoff. Alright. And then once you got

520
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
in the air, you just took a Valium and everything was okay?

521
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
No, I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

522
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
No, I had drugs in case

523
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I needed them, though.

524
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Just in case. Some standby.

525
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
But no, it wasn't too bad.

526
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Hell, by about the time

527
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
we got over the Grand Canyon, I was

528
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
even kind of getting to the point where I could look

529
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
out the window for more than half a second before

530
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
having to look away. Oh, but looking out the

531
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
window is great. Actually, I like going over lakes

532
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
and taking pictures of them.

533
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I like flying JetBlue or

534
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Frontier or any airline that has the

535
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
television in the seat in front of me because

536
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
then I just, and I

537
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
literally did this once. I was on a flight to

538
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
New York, which is about five and a half hours from

539
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
SAC, or SF, and I watched

540
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
SpongeBob SquarePants the entire way.

541
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
It was the best flight I ever took. I didn't have to think

542
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
about the takeoff. I mean, yeah, it's

543
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
noisy, but otherwise it was like,

544
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
you know, SpongeBob SquarePants. Anyway.

545
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Oh, but you bet I whipped out my

546
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
iPod as soon as they announced that we had

547
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
reached cruising altitude. And even

548
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
then I didn't buy the book I bought through the

549
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Kindle app. Isn't that

550
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
funny? You'll bring all this shit and you're like, yeah, I'm gonna

551
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
watch a movie on the plane. I'm gonna play this game.

552
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
And then, like, you just fall asleep.

553
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
At least that's what I do. Well,

554
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
there's more attention span for me, but that

555
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
is part of the reason I made it a point not

556
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
to pack any physical books, just my

557
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
iPod and a notebook

558
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
for writing out my ghetto blog

559
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
mainly. I really like having my netbook

560
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
because it's, um, since I have, like, an

561
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
eight-hour battery on it,

562
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I can just watch movies

563
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
and Doctor Who and stuff

564
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
the entire time. I'll tell you

565
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
what I still do on planes, and this

566
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
is old school. This is what, back in my

567
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
day, before we had a Game Boy,

568
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
this is what we did, okay?

569
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
And still, to this day, I

570
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
like to do this, is that, you know those

571
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
variety games books? They're like the

572
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Penny Press variety crossword

573
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
puzzles and games? Like, they have the crosswords

574
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
and the anagram puzzles

575
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
and, you know, the logic puzzles and

576
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
all those. Surely someone in chat knows

577
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
what I'm talking about. I will buy, like, one

578
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
of those books at the, um,

579
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
you know, they always have, like, a newsstand, and that will

580
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
actually entertain me for a good couple hours on the flight

581
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
because those logic problems are hard, you guys.

582
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
The heck with the chatroom. I actually have

583
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
one somewhere in my room that my mom gave me before

584
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
ASEN that I was gonna do

585
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
on the train up to Chicago,

586
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
and I either lost

587
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
it or I just didn't do it. All I know

588
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
is it's sitting in my room undone still.

589
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Let's be honest.

590
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
You wanna have fun on a plane, train, bus, whatever?

591
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Mad Libs.

592
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Mad Libs are great.

593
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Mad Libs rule. Especially if you're like

594
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
loud Mad Libs. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

595
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
If, like, you guys are all sitting a bunch of seats apart

596
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
and it's all your co-workers

597
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
or your friends, and everyone

598
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
on the plane is really, really annoyed

599
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
with you guys already, start doing

600
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
some Mad Libs. Oh my God.

601
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
It's the most fun you could possibly have.

602
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
But, Dan, keep in mind that

603
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
when I do travel, it's

604
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
usually alone, and I'm

605
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
unless I'm like with

606
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
you, Rob and Jamie, I'm not particularly

607
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
social on my

608
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
method of travel. Do Mad Libs with the people

609
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
next to you. Or do Mad Libs by yourself.

610
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Just be like

611
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
You can do Mad Libs by yourself.

612
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Just turn to the person next to you,

613
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
scary hobo, psycho killer,

614
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
housewife, whatever, and be like, hey,

615
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
you wanna throw down some Mad Libs?

616
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
If they say no, sit next to someone else.

617
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Excuse me, ma'am. Excuse me, excuse me, ma'am.

618
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Ma'am. Ma'am. Ma'am.

619
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Ma'am. I need

620
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
an adjective.

621
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Can I get an adverb?

622
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Can I get a proper noun?

623
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Hit the call button on the flight.

624
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
How can I help you today?

625
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Excuse me, attendant? Yes, I need a noun.

626
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
I need

627
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
an adjective that ends in

628
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Lee. And the good point is

629
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
and the good thing is you probably will see

630
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
any of those fuckers ever again.

631
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
I

632
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
need a transitive verb.

633
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Or you can just use whatever words that they give you.

634
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
You don't have to worry about whether they give you

635
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
the right word or not. Hey, hey,

636
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
give me a word. F off. There you go. Perfect.

637
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Those are gonna be some awesome

638
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Mad Libs.

639
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
I

640
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
don't know what that has to do with games, but who cares.

641
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Alright, housekeeping tonight.

642
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Mad Libs is kind of a game.

643
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Mad Libs are the best of

644
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Do they have like a mad

645
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
They should have Mad Libs on Xbox Live.

646
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
I was just thinking Xbox Live Arcade

647
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Mad Libs. Now that

648
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
1 versus 100 is gone,

649
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
it should be replaced by

650
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Xbox Live Mad Libs.

651
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
And the funnier you can make them, the more points you get.

652
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Hosted by Dan. Yeah.

653
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
I would be better than the guy who did 1 versus 100.

654
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
That's the most fun you can have with your clothes on.

655
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Send in your adverb right now.

656
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Do it. Do it.

657
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Do it. You remember one time

658
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
back early in the show, I tried to do a

659
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Mad Lib. Mad Libs for us.

660
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I think I do remember.

661
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
SSJ 100 Matt has a good point.

662
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
He says, I totally want to sit between

663
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Dan and Rob on a plane.

664
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
I don't blame you, Matt.

665
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
That would be awkward.

666
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
We should do 1 versus, or not 1 versus.

667
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
We should do Orange Land Radio Mad Libs.

668
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
You know, I was thinking the

669
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
same thing, but it was brought to my attention

670
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
that Understation Live has a segment called

671
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
USL Mad Libs. And if we star

672
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
our Mad Libs, I'm going to get a nasty

673
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
voicemail from Travis. Okay. Sorry, Travis.

674
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
We're doing them. Yeah.

675
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
One of these weeks. Ah, screw that.

676
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Maybe even tonight

677
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
if I can find a book, we are doing Mad Libs.

678
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Alright, alright, fine.

679
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Go find a Mad Lib book, and we will

680
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
do Mad Libs in Part B. Don't even think

681
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
we don't have one. I know you got one somewhere.

682
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Jamie, you must find our Mad Libs

683
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
book. Alright. You know, I found them the other day.

684
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
So hurry up and go to Kmart and get a new one or something.

685
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
We could do Chat Room Mad Libs.

686
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Let them suggest. Right, exactly.

687
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
It's the show where every gamer

688
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
gives a noun. Everybody

689
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
gets their word

690
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
in Mad Libs.

691
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Alright.

692
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
I think our chat room is really enjoying

693
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
having you on the show already. Without

694
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Dan, there would not be Mad Libs. It's what we do.

695
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Right. Housekeeping.

696
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Tonight, first

697
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
my opponent. I deleted it!

698
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Wait, that fucker.

699
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
I found that shit

700
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
and I owned it.

701
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Awesome. Thank you, folks.

702
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Good night.

703
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Hey, where's my OS?

704
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
MT Recycle Bin. Hell to the yes.

705
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Everyone, go on your computer and look for

706
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
MS008E

707
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
underscore 247 dot exe and delete

708
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
that shit for me, please. Her computer is gonna be like

709
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
I can't do that, Jamie.

710
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Housekeeping, I wanted to apologize

711
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
that the last podcast is still not up on the

712
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
feed. It'll go up tonight. If I don't

713
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
do it Sunday or Monday, then I don't get around

714
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
to doing it at all. But you'll get two shows

715
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
on the feed this week. And here's the other

716
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
thing, guys, and I know it's gonna be really

717
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
sad, but we have to say it. There's

718
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
not going to be a show next week.

719
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
I'm sorry, but no-

720
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Because of Rob. Well, I'd like

721
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
to think Loki's also partially to blame.

722
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
But I'm gonna be out of town

723
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
next weekend, so I will not be here.

724
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Obviously, Matt is still on baby

725
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
leave. And Jamie, well,

726
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
she'll probably infect her computer or something else.

727
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
So she'll need to- I could just do it

728
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
myself. Just three hours

729
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
of Dan. Dan radio.

730
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
We hate him so

731
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
much. There's a button that you push.

732
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
All you do is wait for Bobby to say

733
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
push the button, and then

734
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
you push the button and you're live.

735
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Radio is so fucking

736
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
easy. Especially shoutcast.

737
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Hell, I even did the shoutcast

738
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
station for a little bit, took part in one.

739
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
It would be cool if I could pump up the volume again.

740
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
I won't be here. That would win.

741
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Maybe we'll try to pre-tape

742
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
this week or something. Maybe.

743
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
I don't want to promise that. Rob. Rob. Rob. Rob.

744
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
What? What is one of my

745
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
major pet peeves using unnecessary

746
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
prefixes?

747
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
I have no idea what she's talking

748
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
about. You don't pre-tape,

749
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
you just tape. Don't you listen to George

750
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Carlin?

751
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Shut up.

752
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Hey, I like having Dan on

753
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
the show.

754
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
No,

755
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
the moment that he says that, I start thinking of ways to

756
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
kill him, so. Alright.

757
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
And I start praying for death.

758
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
I think I'm done apologizing.

759
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Facebook.com slash OrangeLivesRadio

760
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
join our Facebook. He hit me in the booby.

761
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Hey, just so you know, it wasn't like

762
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
violence. I threw a gachamon at her.

763
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
I'll take a picture of it.

764
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Sweet.

765
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Do we even want to do gaming news tonight,

766
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
or should I just let the two of them go at it for three hours?

767
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Welcome to our delightful marriage.

768
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Doesn't Madden come out next week?

769
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Doesn't Madden come out next week? I don't know.

770
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Fuck Madden.

771
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Yes, I will agree with that totally.

772
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Here's the tragedy, okay?

773
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
If you talked to me a couple months ago,

774
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
and I still had a job, I would know

775
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
when Madden's coming out, because it would be like

776
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
my whole life. I'd be like,

777
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
oh man, I gotta get ready for Madden launch.

778
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Oh man, how many Madden pre-orders do I have?

779
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Now that it's not my whole life, I'm just

780
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
like, hey, isn't

781
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
that football game coming out?

782
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Jesus, who cares?

783
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Yeah, World Cup 94.

784
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
No, not football.

785
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Football!

786
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
I thought

787
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
I saw some email about Madden

788
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Midnight Madness. Oh look,

789
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
this page I'm on, look, the whole time

790
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
there's been this giant ad sitting there on the page

791
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
I'm on. Midnight launch at

792
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Walmart, August 10th, so yes,

793
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Madden's out tomorrow.

794
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
I'm awesome at this.

795
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
My favorite part is that the whole time

796
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
we were saying, I don't know, I don't know, it's sitting right

797
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
there on the screen.

798
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
But it's Madden, it won't matter, so it does not

799
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
matter. My screen has the Sega Genesis on it.

800
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
I can't do it.

801
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Alright.

802
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
I regret nothing.

803
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,000
I would like, I wish

804
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
I wish I had more time to be an idiot.

805
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
It makes it so I know I don't want to fuck

806
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Madden, I want Madden to go off and get

807
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
fucked.

808
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Preferably in a big

809
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
flamey death. Here's the thing, I would love

810
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
to go out to the midnight launches

811
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
and do something for the

812
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Madden launch.

813
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
That can happen before the fire happens.

814
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
No, because look, I have friends that play

815
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Madden. You know what?

816
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
I was going to say, you've got to watch out for it, because

817
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
honestly enough, I've done many

818
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
many midnight launches. I've done halos,

819
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
I've done Grand Theft Autos, which are

820
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
by far the scariest.

821
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Especially San Andreas, because our games

822
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
would have laid like five hours.

823
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
But Madden's are the one

824
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
midnight launch where dudes throw down and get into fights.

825
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Wow.

826
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Because you've got these people in line, and you know that they're the

827
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
obsessives because they get in line at like noon.

828
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
It's like, dude, we've got 700

829
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
copies. We're not running out.

830
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
The guy's like, oh, I've got to get my Madden.

831
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Gotta get that Madden. Got that Madden!

832
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
So people are waiting for Madden.

833
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Fuck your Madden prick.

834
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Then they start having this argument about like,

835
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
oh man, the Raiders, this team, oh no,

836
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
this team, that team, and they're like about to throw

837
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
down. And I'm like, guys, guys, look, football.

838
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
And then they like run out in the parking lot

839
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
and start throwing around the football. It worked really

840
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
well. Because I thought they were going to

841
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
kill each other.

842
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Here's the thing, though. If I make fun of

843
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
people that stand in line for Madden,

844
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
then I play World of Warcraft

845
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
and Dance Dance Revolution

846
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
for heaven's sakes. Like, you know,

847
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
it's, you can't like be

848
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
a Trekkie and then look at the guy obsessed with Star Wars

849
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
and call him a nerd, you know what I mean?

850
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Sure you can.

851
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
It's called having a double standard.

852
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
It happens all the time!

853
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
It happens all the time!

854
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
I feel like as a responsible

855
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
gaming journalist,

856
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
That was funny.

857
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
I feel like

858
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
as the, I shouldn't,

859
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
you know, I'm not saying

860
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
make fun of people.

861
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
You know, it's just that you're supposed to make fun

862
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
of people different from you. Which is, in your case,

863
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
everybody. So,

864
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
you know, you just gotta get

865
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
on it. I remember we were waiting for the Dreamcast,

866
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
right? Were you there for, no you weren't there for, that was

867
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
kind of before... That was before I knew you kids.

868
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
That was for the whole Rob time. That's right.

869
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
We were waiting in line for Dreamcast,

870
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
and people were driving by and they were

871
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
making fun of us and we were just making fun of them back.

872
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
But it was Dreamcast, not fucking Madden.

873
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
What are you waiting for? We're like,

874
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Pokemon cards!

875
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
What are you guys waiting for?

876
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Beanie Babies!

877
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
And then this reporter showed up and started covering us

878
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
for the news, and we heckled her so

879
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
mercilessly that she ran off crying.

880
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Midnight launch lines rule.

881
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
You've gotta do it.

882
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
We did the Wii thing, remember?

883
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
We did the donuts and coffee for the Wii.

884
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
I don't remember that.

885
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Yeah, you didn't go, you were asleep.

886
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
I was sleeping because I had to go to a store the next day

887
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
and sell the four Wiis that I had.

888
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Still, Beanie Babies and Pokey News.

889
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Kristen and I were waiting in line and we bribed them for our spot

890
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
at the front of the line.

891
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Yeah, because you got to cut to the front because there was

892
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
a listener of Orange Lawn's radio.

893
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Like the one listener in Sacramento

894
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
happened to be at the front of the line.

895
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Whatever works.

896
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
That's a great story too because Jamie says,

897
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Oh yeah, me and Kristen are gonna go wait in line for the Wii

898
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
if I can get one, can I buy one?

899
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
And I'm like, yeah, yeah, you go on and do that.

900
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Be sure to pick me up a copy of Zelda.

901
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
So I wake up the next day to go sell Wiis

902
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
and I look on my couch, there's a Wii sitting with a copy of Zelda.

903
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
I was like, son of a bitch.

904
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
How did she do that?

905
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,000
It's called contacts.

906
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
I guess.

907
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
I wonder if that guy still listens.

908
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
But as soon as Krispy Kreme opened,

909
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Kris went out and got donuts.

910
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Krispy Kreme is 24 hours, darlin'.

911
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Not that one. It wasn't 24 hours.

912
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
If he does listen, thank you.

913
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
My wife spent $250 on a game console

914
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
that I've played like three times.

915
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,000
We've played it more than that.

916
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Are you gonna play the new Metroid when it comes out?

917
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Probably.

918
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Can you play the new Sonic when it comes out?

919
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
I play everything a little bit. I won't play it on the Wii.

920
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Sonic!

921
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Can we actually get into some gaming news now?

922
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Let me see, how far into the show are we tonight?

923
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
No, what if I refuse?

924
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Hey! Whoever is in the chat room is

925
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
OLR recruit, you got five minutes to change your

926
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
nickname or I kick you.

927
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Damn.

928
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
I know, you're on a power trip tonight.

929
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
What is up with this?

930
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
The program, Rob.

931
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
I've been fringing on her territory so

932
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
she has to be Alpha Jamie.

933
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
My E-peen

934
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
is so huge right now.

935
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Nice.

936
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
So, gaming news.

937
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
I've got a ruler.

938
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Once in a while, shove it up your ass.

939
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Oh!

940
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
See, Rob? That's not appropriate.

941
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Now now, Rob.

942
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Bad. Bad Rob.

943
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Now, aw,

944
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
you made the OLR recruit cry

945
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
because he or she does not know how to

946
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
change their name and they're very sad.

947
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
What the hell was that?

948
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Alright.

949
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
You are walking home.

950
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Alright.

951
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Can I, can I... I somehow doubt it.

952
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Can I, hello, can I, can I

953
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
do the gaming news now? Hello?

954
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Hi, hello? Hi. Gaming news, the hell is that?

955
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Rob. Hello? It's news

956
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
about gaming.

957
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
We need a theme song for gaming news.

958
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Every other show on All Games has some theme song

959
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
when they go into gaming news. We do not have a theme song.

960
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
The Benny Hill theme. I've got one for you, Rob.

961
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Yakety Sax.

962
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
For this episode, I just might have to...

963
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Here's Rob's theme song.

964
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
What?

965
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
No, I was supposed to be the one

966
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
to bust out that app randomly.

967
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Stop it right now.

968
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
What in the flippity fuck was that?

969
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
My Mozilla app.

970
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
You are deleting that.

971
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
If you're listening,

972
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
I need you to be back here.

973
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Like, I know you have a baby.

974
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Please come back

975
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
as soon as possible. I'm trying to help you get in the news.

976
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
I know you are. It's not my fault.

977
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Everything is your fault, Dan.

978
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Now we replace Jamie.

979
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Sweet.

980
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Alright.

981
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Then you can sit in her desk.

982
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Dan, keep in mind,

983
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
I know where you sleep.

984
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
And there's a Dave & Buster letter

985
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
opener right here with kind of sharp edges.

986
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Kind of.

987
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Gaming news? No, gaming news.

988
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Xbox Live Indie

989
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Games.

990
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Might not be getting Kinect.

991
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Alright, here's the deal.

992
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
A lot of folks might be thinking,

993
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
hey, Kinect is coming out soon.

994
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Xbox Live has this whole

995
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
indie games thing. Why can't we have Kinect

996
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
games on Xbox Live? Well, because they don't

997
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
want to let you do it.

998
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Look, this is because of an interview based with

999
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Digital Spy.

1000
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
A Microsoft spokesperson actually said that, quote,

1001
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
only developers with established

1002
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
contacts and

1003
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
contracts with Microsoft

1004
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
are going to be able to make the Kinect games.

1005
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Only those that Microsoft actually

1006
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
partnered with for the launch are able

1007
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
to make the Kinect games.

1008
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
They haven't said that you will never

1009
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
be able to make a Kinect game if you

1010
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
are a developer for XNA. It's going

1011
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
to be considered for the future,

1012
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
but nothing is actually being considered at this

1013
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
time. So sorry there will be no

1014
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Baby Maker

1015
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
2000 or whatever that game is called

1016
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Kinect enabled at launch.

1017
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
It does seem to me to be the dumbest thing

1018
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
they could possibly do. Why is that?

1019
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Well, if you

1020
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
think about it, all the video game

1021
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
companies are going to be trying to do the same thing

1022
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
the same way.

1023
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
They're going to try to make the Kinect work.

1024
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
It's going to be some maniac out there

1025
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
with some indie game idea who's

1026
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
going to come up with the idea that makes

1027
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
the Kinect the must-have

1028
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
object that people

1029
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
will pay $150 for.

1030
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Because the thing is already $60

1031
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
overpriced.

1032
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
They're killing it. They're just

1033
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
killing it.

1034
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
It's killing its chances of becoming

1035
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
the next big thing. Dan, I got to admit

1036
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Dance Central is pretty awesome.

1037
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
You know you want to play Dance Central.

1038
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Dan, are you going to dance to Poker Face?

1039
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Probably not.

1040
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
I'm not saying the Kinect is not a great idea.

1041
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
I believe

1042
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
in the Kinect. I believe in the

1043
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
demonstrations I've seen. I think the

1044
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
technology is amazing. I'm glad

1045
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
to see that somebody is getting on it.

1046
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
And that it's not Sony's

1047
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
pathetic, we-controller

1048
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
rip-off. But at the same

1049
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
time, I just think from a

1050
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
retailer's perspective, they're

1051
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
charging too much for it.

1052
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
And I just don't see it

1053
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
doing anything different

1054
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
yet. I mean, if something comes out

1055
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
with the interactivity of

1056
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
the Milo program

1057
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
and

1058
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
a great game is built

1059
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
around it, and you can

1060
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
stand around and

1061
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
play that game,

1062
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
it'll sell some Kinects, sure.

1063
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
But you need something like

1064
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
the Wii Bowling thing that got

1065
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
everyone to believe in the Wii.

1066
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
The thing on the Wii was, oh wow, that's kind of cool.

1067
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Wii Bowling's amazing! It's like bowling

1068
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
in real life! And the Kinect doesn't

1069
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
have that program.

1070
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Because you're not going to mainstream

1071
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
people with Dance Central.

1072
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Even though it's by Harmonix and it's a great game

1073
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
for Rob.

1074
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
For me.

1075
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Well, because to you,

1076
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
that's the kind of thing that you're into.

1077
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
That's the kind of thing that you love. For me,

1078
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
I was never really into the music rhythm games

1079
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
except for Guitar Hero

1080
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
and Guitar Freaks and whatnot.

1081
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Well, of course you're going to want it to.

1082
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
That way you have to spend the money on it.

1083
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Maybe there will be a Red Dead Redemption Part 2

1084
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
where you can actually choke a bitch.

1085
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Sure! Exactly!

1086
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Where I can lasso

1087
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
everyone in town by waving my arm

1088
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
and, wait, that didn't look so good.

1089
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
That looks like I'm playing Dance Party there.

1090
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Or Dance Central.

1091
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
But yeah, they just need to come up with

1092
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
the right program, and I think that telling the indie

1093
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
developers, yeah, you guys are out

1094
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
on this is a big mistake.

1095
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
If Choke-a-Bitch mode happened

1096
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
in the next Red Dead Redemption,

1097
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
I might even have to invest in that.

1098
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Screw Choke-a-Bitch mode. Someone just needs

1099
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
to release a game called Choke-a-Bitch.

1100
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Even better.

1101
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Could you do that lasso motion one more time in Studio

1102
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Dam for us? Let's do the

1103
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
lasso motion one more time.

1104
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Oh, darn it.

1105
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
I screwed on the thing I was trying to do.

1106
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
I was going to get Dan some music to do his

1107
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
lassoing, too.

1108
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
That's a poker face.

1109
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Come on, Dan.

1110
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Is it on YouTube?

1111
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Swing that hand, Dan.

1112
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
That's classy.

1113
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Everything is on YouTube.

1114
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
You know what? I like the piano version of that song.

1115
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
I like the Cartman version.

1116
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
I don't even know how I got into

1117
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Just Dance. There's a Cartman version? Why am I not

1118
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
surprised? Other comments from our chatroom

1119
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
at chat.orangelaunchradio.com

1120
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Let's see. Sj100matt

1121
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
says that our good buddy and indie developer

1122
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
YYR is pissed about this.

1123
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
He was going to make Killer

1124
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Wheelchair Golden Girls game using

1125
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Kinect. See, that's what

1126
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Microsoft's afraid of.

1127
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Is that if they let the indie developers make

1128
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
it, somebody's going to make the Golden Girls

1129
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
game featuring Kinect, and then

1130
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
that's going to be the must-have game.

1131
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Not dancing.

1132
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
They still have ultimate control over what

1133
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
release is.

1134
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Right?

1135
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Yes, but

1136
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
if it's objectionable,

1137
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
reject it.

1138
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
XNA is a little different, because it's all

1139
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
community-based, and

1140
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Microsoft, per se, I mean, yes,

1141
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
they have ultimate control over it, but

1142
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
they don't really babysit it. It's all

1143
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
community-driven. It's like, what's the difference

1144
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
being controlled by your controller and controlled

1145
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
by Kinect? I think

1146
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
it's probably a technical

1147
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
problem. You know, I think that

1148
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
the Kinect is not working out as well as I thought it

1149
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
was already, and so now they're like,

1150
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
oh, no, we just won't let the indie guys on it,

1151
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
and, you know, we can

1152
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
give the developers specific instructions

1153
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
how to make the thing work.

1154
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
They don't want to show all their cards,

1155
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
basically. Maybe.

1156
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Anyhow, let's move on with more gaming news.

1157
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Dark Sakura, surely you have something you want to share with us tonight.

1158
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Well, it's about the move.

1159
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
The move.

1160
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Hahahaha, Sony.

1161
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Well, they

1162
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
are not going to have just a kiosk

1163
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
for showing that they've actually

1164
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
given me reps, Sony is,

1165
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
to teach people how to use the move

1166
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
in person. Ooh.

1167
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Is it that complex? Is it that

1168
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
big of a deal? Yeah, and the

1169
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
reps are all training on Nintendo Wiis.

1170
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
But they are going

1171
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
to be

1172
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
giving seven hours of

1173
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
move training to

1174
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
people who already have a base knowledge

1175
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
of Sony consoles.

1176
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
And the competition.

1177
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Ooh.

1178
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Speaking of, um, stupid,

1179
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
they're actually coming out.

1180
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
What?

1181
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
I don't...

1182
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
And speaking of, um, stupid,

1183
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
that was funny, so don't stop.

1184
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Okay, anyway, speaking of stupid, um,

1185
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
there's actually accessories that are going to be

1186
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
out with the move, like gloves.

1187
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Yes, they are

1188
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
gloves.

1189
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
And you can secure the move

1190
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
thing to the glove

1191
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
so that you don't drop it.

1192
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
What else can you

1193
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
secure to the glove? Probably a

1194
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
cog.

1195
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Okay. It is kind of, well,

1196
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
the move is kind of wide

1197
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
like a good dildo, so maybe you could put a vibrator

1198
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
in there.

1199
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Kay.

1200
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
That's my wife, ladies and gentlemen!

1201
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
No.

1202
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
I'm just saying, I'm using my

1203
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
imagination. You said what else could go in there that would be

1204
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
useful. Joe Digitech in our chatroom is calling

1205
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
him Love Gloves.

1206
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Cucumbers, Rob!

1207
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
What if you're really, really

1208
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
hungry, okay, get this, what if you're

1209
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
really, really hungry and you're playing your move

1210
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
and you don't really want to

1211
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
have to let go of your cucumber to

1212
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
play? Will it be cross

1213
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
compatible with Nintendo Wii accessories?

1214
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Is it a bumpy cucumber? I bet you can use it

1215
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
with a Wiimote!

1216
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Classic!

1217
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
But yeah, stupid.

1218
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
You guys could use them on your microphones.

1219
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
That's true, we can use them on our microphones

1220
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
but we don't drop them because we're too...

1221
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
I guess maybe we don't have the

1222
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
fine motor control or brain power

1223
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
to understand. Open hand,

1224
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
insert object, close hand.

1225
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Hold tightly!

1226
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Maybe? I think if you're going to release an accessory

1227
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
that's so complex that you need to

1228
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
train people to train people

1229
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
for you to pay people to train

1230
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
people how to use it. For seven hours

1231
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
of training? Okay, but to be fair, to be fair,

1232
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
fair Dan, let's be fair.

1233
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
We're fair. A couple weeks ago on the show

1234
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
we talked about Kinect doing demos

1235
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
at Macy's.

1236
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
So they are also sending

1237
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
people out to teach them how to use Kinect

1238
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
which really involves just

1239
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
flailing. There isn't even

1240
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
a controller to use. No gloves,

1241
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
no cucumbers,

1242
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
just you.

1243
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
And your cucumber.

1244
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
They didn't train anyone how to use iToy.

1245
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Well, we

1246
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
saw how that went. Exactly. All they needed

1247
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
to do was get the window washing game out there at

1248
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Macy's and it was sold like crazy.

1249
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
That little game where you were like the ninja and you were like

1250
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
standing on the screen and hitting all the little ninjas.

1251
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
That was pretty fun.

1252
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
So now, I guess it is, now people decide to

1253
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
abuse Kinect. They can say

1254
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
well we have people out there teaching them how to use it

1255
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
right. It's not our

1256
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
fault. We showed them how to do it. Well

1257
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
companies do believe that all their users

1258
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
are devastatingly stupid.

1259
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
When my bank got new ATMs, they had a

1260
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
couple days where people would stand outside and

1261
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
teach you how to use the ATM. Nice.

1262
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
They were called the ATM

1263
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
ambassadors.

1264
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Did you have to use them? Because I'd be like

1265
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
if they were like, do you need

1266
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
help using the ATM? I'd be like, get the fuck out of here.

1267
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
I don't want you seeing my pin. Unfortunately,

1268
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
I wasn't using the ATM. I was taking my deposit

1269
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
to the bank when I was working at the store.

1270
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Did you know that the new ATMs will actually

1271
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
take your deposits? We would make fun of the ATM

1272
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
ambassador every morning.

1273
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
I don't think he liked me very much.

1274
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Yeah, but it was a job.

1275
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Pointing at him and laughing.

1276
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
It was a job.

1277
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Our chat room is suggesting that as far as these gloves go,

1278
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
you can get a glittery one for the new Michael

1279
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Jackson game.

1280
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Dot, dot, dot.

1281
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
They're padded.

1282
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Is it just so that you don't

1283
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
accidentally punch yourself in the face for something to do?

1284
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
I'm gonna put

1285
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
the picture of this in the chat room.

1286
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
The new move helmet.

1287
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Don't

1288
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
forget about the crayons that come as a pack

1289
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
and snack.

1290
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Because

1291
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
if you're playing games with the woo, the move,

1292
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
you obviously need a helmet. The woo?

1293
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
The woo. The woo?

1294
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
I would like to see a console

1295
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
named the woo. We have the wee and the woo.

1296
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
There should be a console named the woos.

1297
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
The woos? Like the maze.

1298
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Do you remember? Tangent time.

1299
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Actually, this is a reflow. We need the

1300
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
little dream sequence.

1301
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Well, you got control. Make it happen.

1302
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
I don't have every sound

1303
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
ever known a man. You're killing me with this.

1304
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Look, look, look.

1305
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Back in the day, Nintendo Power

1306
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
like sixth or seventh

1307
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
issue, they actually profiled

1308
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
a real life video game

1309
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
that existed in Vacaville, California.

1310
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
It was called the woos. Yeah.

1311
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
And it was the maze. And that's what Dan's

1312
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
referring to. That was a Nintendo Power, huh?

1313
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
The Nintendo Power was awesome.

1314
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Twenty years ago, yes.

1315
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Oh yeah. Or whenever it started.

1316
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Back when Nintendo Power started, it was amazing.

1317
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
And then GamePro came out

1318
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
and we all made fun of it because it wasn't as good as Nintendo Power.

1319
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
The woos Vacaville.

1320
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
I was on like Team GamePro

1321
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
or whatever it was called. There's a website up.

1322
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Yeah, it was like you had to write an essay

1323
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
and they picked 250 people to be in their little club

1324
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
and do you know what we did once we were in the club?

1325
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Nothing.

1326
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Yeah. So it's like I won

1327
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
I don't even remember what I wrote my essay on

1328
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
but yeah, it was a long time ago.

1329
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
But sadly the woos is long gone.

1330
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
They bulldozed the woos. Way gone.

1331
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
I posted a link.

1332
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Is it a car dealership or an outlet mall?

1333
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Oh, that might be where they built the outlets.

1334
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
I'm pretty sure that's where they built the outlets.

1335
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Oh, how sad.

1336
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
So every time I go to the big

1337
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Calvin Klein outlet store

1338
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
that was once...

1339
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
That's what you do is you walk up and down the aisle

1340
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
and the sales people are finally like, what are you doing?

1341
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
I can't find my way out.

1342
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Okay, this is kind of funny.

1343
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
I found a blog about it with an aerial view.

1344
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
It probably was the same aerial view

1345
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
that was in Nintendo Power years ago.

1346
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
They would actually change the configuration.

1347
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
I love how this starts. Back in the late 80s

1348
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
things sucked. The music sucked.

1349
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
The movie sucked. The entertainment slash things

1350
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
that you do sucked. What the fuck are they smoking?

1351
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Back in the late 80s the movies rocked.

1352
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
We had hella arcades then.

1353
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
What a hell, author.

1354
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
This person apparently is pooping on the woos.

1355
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
It was born in 1991

1356
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
so kiss my ass.

1357
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Alright, what's next?

1358
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Princess Bride did not suck.

1359
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Thank you.

1360
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Mystique came in and said,

1361
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
hey, hey.

1362
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
I don't even know what you're talking about.

1363
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Because the Princess Bride was like 87, 88.

1364
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Right.

1365
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
And this guy says that there were no good movies in the late 80s

1366
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
and therefore Mystique has just

1367
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
made a logic

1368
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
she's done a logic thing.

1369
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Wow, anything can happen once.

1370
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
It's inconceivable.

1371
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
I do not think that word

1372
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
means what you think it means.

1373
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
My head hurts.

1374
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Let's talk about

1375
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
NBA Elite 11.

1376
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
It comes with NBA Jam.

1377
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Thank you, Dan. That's what I was going to report.

1378
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
That's a scam. It's a scam

1379
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
because I have no interest in NBA

1380
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Elite 11 but I want NBA Jam

1381
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
with a burning, fiery passion.

1382
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
And I don't want to pay 60 bucks for it.

1383
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
It's a fake.

1384
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
What?

1385
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
So just pretend you didn't hear that and I'm going to report

1386
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
this news you've never heard before.

1387
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
NBA Elite 11

1388
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
will have a one-time download code

1389
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
that will let you access

1390
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
three modes of NBA Jam, Play Now,

1391
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Classic Campaign, and online.

1392
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
This would explain why we saw ESRB ratings

1393
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
last week.

1394
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
They are not selling these separately, at least

1395
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
for now. My gut tells me

1396
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
where there's money to be made.

1397
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
This is how it's going to work for like two months

1398
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
or three months and then it'll be out for everybody.

1399
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Well sure, it's EA and EA is all

1400
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
about the money but oh man.

1401
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
For people like me who are idiots

1402
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
who have been dying for NBA Jam

1403
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
either I got to pay 50 bucks to get it

1404
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
on the Wii or I got to pay 60

1405
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
bucks to get it on the 360 rather

1406
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
than paying the 15 bucks which I would be totally

1407
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
willing to pay to get it on the 360.

1408
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Because

1409
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
I love NBA Jam. I don't like

1410
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
sports games but I love

1411
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
NBA Jam.

1412
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
I am in

1413
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
your court.

1414
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
I made a basketball joke.

1415
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
That was awesome.

1416
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
I hate you so much.

1417
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
I don't like a lot of sports

1418
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
games either but I love NBA

1419
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Jam, Double Dribble,

1420
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Blades of Steel. Oh, Blades of Steel

1421
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
is sweet. It's like the best game

1422
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Konami ever made. I like the fact that you can play

1423
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Gradius at halftime. I know, right?

1424
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
That's what everybody loves.

1425
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
So sports games

1426
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
aren't always like

1427
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
missable for me. Like there's some

1428
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
that you have to have. And I'm kind of in the same court

1429
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
as you. They have to put the fun in. If they're

1430
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
fun, you will play

1431
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
them. How can I not

1432
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
want NBA Jam on the 360

1433
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
or even the PS3 because

1434
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
360 means Xbox Live means I

1435
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
can Boom Shakalaka

1436
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
with my friends.

1437
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Right. That sounded dirty, Rob.

1438
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
You could be like, puts it up.

1439
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Sweet touch.

1440
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Aw, NBA Jam is so cool.

1441
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
I miss the old machines

1442
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
where if you put in the right date you can play as

1443
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Mortal Kombat characters.

1444
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
And Bill Clinton. That was the first

1445
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
revision of NBA Jam Tournament

1446
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Edition. Hold on, though.

1447
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
The way of looking at it that you just

1448
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
said, Dan, is that I can pay $50

1449
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
to have it on the Wii or I

1450
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
could just wait and pay $15

1451
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
for it on the Xbox 360. But that's assuming

1452
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
it would be $15. What if

1453
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
EA knows they have a premium

1454
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
game here? What if you were looking at it

1455
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
as I'm paying $60 for NBA

1456
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Jam and getting some other basketball game

1457
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
for free? That's pretty graphics. Right. If it

1458
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
was a full release, because the thing is I'll

1459
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
never play NBA Elite 11.

1460
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
I just never will. Not even once? Probably not.

1461
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Okay. Because I've

1462
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
played NBA Live. I've

1463
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
played NBA 2K. You know, and

1464
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
honestly, in

1465
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
this race, my

1466
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
horse is definitely 2K.

1467
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
It's just better. I mean, I

1468
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
understand everyone out there. Oh, NBA

1469
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
EA Sports, whatever. NBA

1470
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Live has just been atrocious

1471
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
since like 2005.

1472
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
But NBA Jam is awesome. Hence why it's

1473
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
now NBA Elite. Exactly.

1474
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
They finally said, okay, we're tired of getting our asses

1475
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
kicked by 2K. We're going to change the

1476
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
name. We're going to change the game. And then 2K is like,

1477
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Jordan, motherfuckers!

1478
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
And then Elite was like, screw!

1479
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
This sucks!

1480
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
We'll put NBA Jam with

1481
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
it! And I'm just like, oh, touche.

1482
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Touche EA. Very well

1483
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
played. A2 EA?

1484
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Yeah, whatever. Yeah, I

1485
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
want NBA Jam bad.

1486
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Tigerclaw in our chatroom

1487
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
says, think about it. If NBA Jam had

1488
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
online, we can try to represent the OL Army

1489
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
in the big battles sometime in the future.

1490
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
I completely forgot to mention Big Battle

1491
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
during housekeeping because I got derailed. Something about

1492
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Mad Libs, but something

1493
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
that the listeners have been asking

1494
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
for forever is coming to the

1495
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Big Battle. A music game.

1496
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
That's right. Guitar Hero 5 is now in the Big Battle.

1497
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
So check it out. TheBigBattle.net

1498
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
There you go. And if OLR

1499
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
doesn't win the music game competition,

1500
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
I don't, like,

1501
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
like, really? Really?

1502
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
I will disown all of you. No, I'm kidding.

1503
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
I think my solution is if somebody

1504
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
is buying NBA Elite and doesn't

1505
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
care about NBA Jam, I will

1506
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
buy their download code from them.

1507
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
You're not gonna find that person.

1508
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
You're killing me with this, Rob.

1509
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
Well, I'm not gonna

1510
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
buy it all special and shit.

1511
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
See, I'm looking at it this

1512
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
way. What if instead of looking

1513
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
at it as I'm buying this game

1514
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
and getting ripped off with this game

1515
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
I don't even want, what if, okay, NBA

1516
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Jam on the Wii cost me

1517
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
$50, I could pay

1518
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
$10 more to get it on the 360,

1519
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
which is, you know, pretty much what

1520
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
most premium usually is.

1521
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
You have to look at it the other way around.

1522
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
I mean, sure, I want

1523
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
it to come out for $15, too, but

1524
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
you know, think about how the Wii

1525
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
folks would be in an uproar if it was like, well,

1526
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
it's $15 there but you're gonna charge me $50?

1527
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
F you.

1528
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
The Wii version gets extra modes.

1529
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
I guess that's true, they do have extra modes.

1530
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
They get like the classic Super

1531
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Star Tour and stuff, which I could care

1532
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
less about. Alright.

1533
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Alright, let's, uh,

1534
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
let's move on for more news. Can I just completely

1535
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
get away from sports, please? Yes, you may.

1536
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Let's take a deep

1537
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
breath of air.

1538
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
If we were talking about

1539
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
rugby or cricket... NBA

1540
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
DJ Max

1541
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
portable 3

1542
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
has, um,

1543
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
some, uh, new features.

1544
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
It's, uh, and keep in mind this is

1545
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
not a game that I have really played much

1546
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
if any of, but they have

1547
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
a, um, 3-track remixing

1548
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
system that's made just for that

1549
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
particular version. Um,

1550
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
and, uh,

1551
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
it, I was watching the video

1552
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
of it while you were going off on,

1553
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
um, NBA, whatever.

1554
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
And, um,

1555
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
but they're saying that, um,

1556
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
that it's supposed to actually

1557
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
be a completely revamped system.

1558
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
It looks kinda neat.

1559
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Did they put a mode in the game that will

1560
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
make it fun? I'm kidding,

1561
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
I'm kidding, DJ Max is fine. DJ Max is,

1562
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
it's BeatMania 2DX with buttons on your PS3

1563
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
and it's fine, I'm just giving it a hard time.

1564
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
I just wanted, like, some of the DJ Max

1565
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
fans to sit there and

1566
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
make this. The music is actually sounding

1567
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
kinda cool. The music's neat.

1568
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:25,000
This is a great radio, we're just sitting here.

1569
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
I don't know what that is, but that gave me

1570
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
a headache.

1571
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Ah, creepy girl with no eyes.

1572
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Alright.

1573
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
I don't know, uh, I'm glad they're putting in some new

1574
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
modes and some new ideas so it doesn't just

1575
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
feel like a 2DX port. It's kinda cool.

1576
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
And, you know, to be fair, they have had

1577
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
some other stuff, like, they do, like, like a

1578
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
3-button mode, a 6-button mode, a

1579
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
11 billion button mode. They do

1580
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
all these different, like, modes and tricks

1581
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
with it. Somebody else's PSP mode,

1582
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
somebody's Wii mode.

1583
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
I would like to see 2DX on the

1584
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
PSP. I would like to see 2DX

1585
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
on the PS3. With the Konami-style

1586
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
2DX PSP controller.

1587
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Like, where is my PlayStation

1588
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
3 version, like, of 2DX?

1589
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Why has that not come out yet?

1590
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
I thought 2DX was over.

1591
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
No, it's still going in the arcades in Japan.

1592
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Oh, I thought that they actually did a final version.

1593
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
They did a final BeatMania.

1594
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
They did BeatMania 1

1595
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
and they did BeatMania 3 final,

1596
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
but they never did a BeatMania 2 Deluxe final.

1597
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Interesting. That's still going.

1598
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
They're on, like, what...

1599
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
98th style, U6. I don't know, they're on, like,

1600
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
18th or 19th style. They're a lot.

1601
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
Nice. Because it proved popular

1602
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
and has longevity.

1603
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
It's a neat game. It's because that arcade machine

1604
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
is amazing. The next one's gonna be

1605
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
with remix mode or some shit in it.

1606
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
It's so good.

1607
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Well, if you like these DJ games, maybe

1608
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
DJ Hero 2 is something you're interested in.

1609
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
I know I am, actually. The first DJ Hero game

1610
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
was really underrated. Why are you laughing at me?

1611
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Oh, you told me I was gonna jump in and say,

1612
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
but probably not.

1613
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
No, DJ Hero 2 is gonna

1614
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
have, of course, the multiplayer mode. And DJ Hero

1615
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
1 had that too, but one thing that was missing when

1616
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
you would play online is rewind.

1617
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
That's right. Now you can

1618
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
rewind in multiplayer mode.

1619
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
You couldn't do that before, but now you're actually

1620
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
gonna get to rewind. So once you get enough power

1621
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
in the multiplayer mode, you're gonna be able to spin

1622
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
the thing backwards and you rewind the track

1623
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
and get more points. So in DJ Hero 2,

1624
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
this will be in there. And what

1625
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
happens is that while you rewind, your opponent

1626
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
gets to do nothing while you

1627
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
rack up the points.

1628
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
So that'll be kinda fun.

1629
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Yeah, that's gonna get pretty ugly.

1630
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
I'm just looking forward to

1631
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
the rapping in it and how that'll play out online.

1632
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
Actually, Dan, I would love to do

1633
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
some DJ Hero where I will do the DJ and you do

1634
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
the rapping. Wouldn't that be fun?

1635
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
You know what we need?

1636
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
I would throw down. We need Dan

1637
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
playing Def Jam Rap Star.

1638
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Is this out yet?

1639
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
I think it's coming out soon.

1640
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
I heard about that and that sounds amazing.

1641
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Here's the thing, you guys.

1642
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
I know not everybody is into rap music.

1643
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
I can

1644
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
give or take it, depending on who the artist is.

1645
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
But the music game that they're doing

1646
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
actually looks really good.

1647
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
They had Def

1648
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Jam Rap Star sitting next to

1649
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
Glee Karaoke Revolution.

1650
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
And I will tell you what,

1651
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
Def Jam Rap Star

1652
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
popped a cap in Glee's ass so

1653
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
fast it's not even funny because the Glee game

1654
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
was terrible. It's terrible.

1655
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Well, first of all, anything that Konami

1656
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
I mean, I hate to say this because I have

1657
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
great love for Konami. But anything that Konami

1658
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
does these days is pretty bad.

1659
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Dance Masters looks

1660
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
interesting. It's the first really

1661
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
really interesting music game I've seen from them in a while.

1662
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Who knows? But the budget's gone.

1663
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Konami is not into

1664
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
gaming like they were. There's just not

1665
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
a lot of...

1666
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
Well, they closed one of their

1667
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
offices that was a huge part of it.

1668
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
They closed a lot of it. I mean, a lot of Konami

1669
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
is just history. All the good talent is

1670
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
gone.

1671
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
They're basically outsourcing

1672
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
their franchises to make some money, but

1673
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
yeah, anything that Konami

1674
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
does is

1675
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
pretty cut rate these days.

1676
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
Not to get off topic, but what do you think of that

1677
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
Castlevania game that's coming out? The Castlevania

1678
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
God of War thing?

1679
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Hopefully going to be okay?

1680
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
I mean, Castlevania

1681
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
in 3D is pretty miss and miss.

1682
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
Not that

1683
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Lament of Innocence

1684
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
and Curse of Darkness was the

1685
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
other one. Those weren't the worst

1686
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
3D action games to ever happen, but

1687
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
they weren't the quality of what you'd

1688
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
consider Castlevania. The new one

1689
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
looks really good.

1690
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
They say they got Kojima on it

1691
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
and Kojima's kind of

1692
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Konami's only superstar that's

1693
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
really left, so

1694
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
if it's awesome, great.

1695
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
I just don't know

1696
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
I just don't have a lot of

1697
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
you know, hope for

1698
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
3D Castlevania. If I play it and I like it

1699
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
I'm going to be pleasantly surprised. If you like

1700
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
God of War, I think you'll like it. It's very pretty.

1701
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
It's much sexier than

1702
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
the other 3D games. Of course it's on a different

1703
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
console too. It looks great. But I totally

1704
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
get what you're saying because Symphony of the Night was easily

1705
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
easily one of the top 10 video games

1706
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
ever made. Symphony of the Night is

1707
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
there's almost no equal.

1708
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
I still like Run to a Blood better.

1709
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
And so it's kind of like every Castlevania game since then

1710
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
it just hasn't compared.

1711
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
Yeah.

1712
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
Well, they're all building off of that formula

1713
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
and you know, they're all

1714
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
all the 2D ones are, you know

1715
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
they're all portables and you know

1716
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
they lose points for that.

1717
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Not that they're bad, but yeah.

1718
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
I really like Portrait of Ruin when I got through it.

1719
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
Portrait of Ruin was a great game.

1720
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
Let's see, SalaciousPop in our chatroom

1721
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
says, Konami only seems to burp up new flavors

1722
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
of Castlevania and Silent Hill. What was

1723
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
their last really new IP?

1724
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
Saw.

1725
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Hahahaha

1726
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
Hahahaha

1727
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
Okay. I'm actually trying to think.

1728
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
SHJ100 Matt

1729
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
is still waiting on a new Zone of Enders game.

1730
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Everybody who came into the store and

1731
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
saw there was a Saw game, everybody was like

1732
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
there's a Saw game?

1733
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
Is it any good?

1734
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
I don't know. No one's ever played it.

1735
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
I've heard from people that can stomach

1736
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
those kind of games that it's actually

1737
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
not as bad as you'd think. And you know what? I did

1738
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
I did play, well I watched

1739
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
I watched Shane play the second

1740
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
games demo at E3 and

1741
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
it was interesting except for

1742
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
all the gore. I just don't like

1743
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
that stuff. But yet I love

1744
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
Silent Hill. I can't explain it.

1745
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Silent Hill isn't

1746
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
well, it's a different kind of gore. It's more of a

1747
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
decay. And I feel like

1748
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Saw is more like LOL gore.

1749
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Like it's just like random. LOL gore.

1750
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
Here's how I put it.

1751
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Look at the violence.

1752
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Where Saw is

1753
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
fresh, squirting, pulsating blood.

1754
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
Silent Hill is, it's been

1755
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
dead for a while, but it's still twitching.

1756
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
Or the gore serves

1757
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
as much as I hate to say this, a

1758
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
plot point, as weird as that is.

1759
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
It's for scene, not for

1760
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
shock. Check out his head, it's a pyramid.

1761
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Yes.

1762
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Dude, this guy's wearing a big metal triangle

1763
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
on his head. Triangle man.

1764
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
Triangle man.

1765
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
How about another

1766
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
piece of gaming news, Dark

1767
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
Sakura? News? That's fantastic.

1768
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
This made me laugh my ass off, Rob.

1769
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Nipponichi,

1770
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
the company that made

1771
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
Disgaea, is doing a game called Criminal Girls

1772
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
for PSP. And

1773
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
it's like bad 70's

1774
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
chicks in prison

1775
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
is what it is.

1776
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
This sounds awesome.

1777
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Was it directed by Quentin Tarantino?

1778
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Is Lizzie Lohan in it?

1779
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
Aw man, Machete's gonna be great.

1780
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
No, but Lady Gaga is.

1781
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
Sorry. Good enough.

1782
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
Oh, is it gonna be like the telephone music video

1783
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
for real? Cause that's awesome.

1784
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Can I create the cam story? No.

1785
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
Not tonight.

1786
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
Anyway, you play as

1787
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
an all female prison warden

1788
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
that's set in hell.

1789
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
And you have to rehabilitate

1790
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
seven prisoners, and each of the

1791
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
prisoners are like seven deadly sins.

1792
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
So you have gluttony, greed, lust,

1793
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
you know.

1794
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
Is it home for infinite losers?

1795
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Misty comes in and asks, is it the home for

1796
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
infinite losers? You don't have a microphone.

1797
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
That's what she keeps doing.

1798
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
If you're gonna say something, come in and grab the microphone.

1799
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
Just take Misty's when she's not looking.

1800
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
So you know how you have to rehabilitate

1801
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
them, Rob? How?

1802
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
With spankings and massages.

1803
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
I read about this. Cause here's the deal.

1804
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
Nipponichi had

1805
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
to cancel like three projects.

1806
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
You okay?

1807
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
Breathe, Dark Soccer,

1808
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
breathe. You alright?

1809
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
It's really not that funny. Nipponichi

1810
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
had to cancel like three or four projects

1811
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
and this is the one that they kept.

1812
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
I'm actually

1813
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
getting scared a little bit, Dark Soccer, are you

1814
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
okay? Only a little bit?

1815
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Spanking

1816
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
and massages.

1817
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:47,000
Does it work

1818
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
with the Kinect?

1819
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
It's on the

1820
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
PSP.

1821
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Does it work with the Kinect anyway?

1822
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
Probably.

1823
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
I'm sure someone will find a way.

1824
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
I am...

1825
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
So wait, let me

1826
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
get this straight again. You are

1827
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
in a prison

1828
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
in hell and you

1829
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
spank people to

1830
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
massage them.

1831
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
Or massage them, right? Is that what I heard?

1832
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
I think, ladies and gentlemen...

1833
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
Video game of the year 2010.

1834
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
There's pictures. Let me find the picture.

1835
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
It was...

1836
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Oh my gosh.

1837
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
Was the secret word spank?

1838
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
Did Pee Wee Herman

1839
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
come out before the show?

1840
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
It was in Dengeki

1841
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
PlayStation magazine.

1842
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
You know, maybe I

1843
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
missed the break during Bobby's show tonight.

1844
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
Did he come out and say, today's secret

1845
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
word is spank.

1846
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
Oh, so that's why I missed it.

1847
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
If somebody says spank, scream real loud.

1848
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
Are you okay, Dark Soccer?

1849
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
I'm going to put the link to the picture

1850
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
in there of

1851
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
what the characters

1852
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
look like with their ginormous

1853
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
boobies. And again, to listen live,

1854
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock

1855
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, and

1856
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
I know this makes for terrible radio, but I'm looking

1857
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
at this. Of course, they have gigantic

1858
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
tits.

1859
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
And they're like doing that whole blushing

1860
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
thing. It looks like, see how like, okay,

1861
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
notice this, like the top of their tits is

1862
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
red. That's either like a really bad

1863
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
sunburned tan. It's boob blush.

1864
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
Or they're getting spanked on their tits.

1865
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Probably. Oh, even better, it's boob blush.

1866
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
I can tell you... Women actually

1867
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
blush their boobies? I didn't know that.

1868
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
Boobs can blush. Have you ever blushed your

1869
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
boobs? Not on purpose.

1870
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
This tells you how bad

1871
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
off the Japanese gaming market is.

1872
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
Did Dan just have red stuff on his face

1873
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
and he just went...

1874
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
They're not very red right now. This is a

1875
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
story about how bad the Japanese gaming

1876
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
market is. That's red!

1877
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
They're killing their important projects and they're

1878
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
keeping this. They know who their

1879
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
market is. Well, right, because that's the

1880
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
people in Japan who are buying the games or the

1881
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
psycho pervert otakus. Um, I'm

1882
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
sorry, but this game sounds

1883
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
awesome. And why are you

1884
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
knocking it? Because we should be getting this game

1885
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
as well. We won't, but we should.

1886
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
This is President Cat 2010

1887
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
right here. I want this game.

1888
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
I still want President Cat! Damn it, me too.

1889
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
Why have you not

1890
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
done this for me, husband?

1891
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
I have no idea what you're talking about.

1892
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
President Cat! Your husband doesn't actually

1893
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
listen to this show. He just likes to come on once in a while

1894
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
and bring the lols. I

1895
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
know about the existence of President

1896
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Cat, but I don't really know what she's

1897
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
talking about.

1898
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
That's alright.

1899
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
Hey, let's get into what video games

1900
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
are coming out soon and around

1901
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
the world. We're going to travel the world and look at release

1902
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
dates, and we'll start in America.

1903
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
America.

1904
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
Coming out this...

1905
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
You said

1906
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
America, Rob, so I was just representing.

1907
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
I hope the mic didn't pick that up.

1908
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
You know the mic turns off, you know.

1909
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
Mine doesn't. I was just representing.

1910
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Ooh, thank you. AlphaKananagram in chat brings up a good point.

1911
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
The PSP is region-free, so

1912
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
it's less of a pain than region-locked President

1913
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Cat. Good job.

1914
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
Love it. Alright, coming out this week in America,

1915
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
Madden NFL 11.

1916
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
Of course, we already talked about that before. It's coming out on the

1917
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
10th, and there's midnight launches going on everywhere.

1918
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
And do any games

1919
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
dare to compete against Madden

1920
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
11? I don't think

1921
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
so. There's not a lot else coming out.

1922
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
Let me see what counter... There's also tons and tons

1923
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
and tons of

1924
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
peripherals and things coming out.

1925
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
But as far as games coming out against

1926
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
Madden 11, nope.

1927
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
This is Madden's week. That's it for the US.

1928
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Meanwhile in England, they're like,

1929
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
Madden, that's a game

1930
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
for wankers!

1931
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
We have

1932
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
coming out on the 10th,

1933
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
Dragon Age Golems of Amgarak.

1934
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
Um,

1935
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
on 11th, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World.

1936
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
On the 12th, yeah, Madden NFL 11.

1937
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
Like, anyone's gonna give a crap about it over there.

1938
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
Um, 13 is Hoop World.

1939
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
And Ship Simulator Extremes.

1940
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
That's it.

1941
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
I gotta say,

1942
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
just tangent a little bit,

1943
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
I didn't know much about that whole Scott Pilgrim vs.

1944
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
the World thing. I didn't realize

1945
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
that it's based on a comic book

1946
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
where clearly the author has a huge

1947
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
boner for video games, because there's so

1948
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
many video game references in it.

1949
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
Uh oh, Mystique's coming in.

1950
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
And he's Canadian.

1951
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
Well then, fuck him!

1952
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
I'm just kidding.

1953
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
He's from Canadia. I love Canadia.

1954
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
All right.

1955
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
Is that near Albonia?

1956
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Look, look, I have Canadian friends,

1957
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
okay? Okay?

1958
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
I'm sorry. All right.

1959
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
I like the Canadianites.

1960
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
No, for real though. Uh oh.

1961
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
Mystique's coming in.

1962
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
We're here. We're here. Flap, flap, flap.

1963
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
Because she's wearing, I think, flip flops or something.

1964
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
Smack, smack, smack, smack, smack, smack.

1965
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Never mind.

1966
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
So, but here's the thing.

1967
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
At first I had no interest in seeing the movie

1968
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
because I was like, oh, it's Michael Cera

1969
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
and it's not Arrested Development.

1970
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
So why would I care, right?

1971
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
But then I hear it's all about this

1972
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
video game, like, homage.

1973
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
And then the whole, like, thing where they actually

1974
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
went to Miyamoto to get the rights to use

1975
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
the Zelda music in the thing.

1976
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
And the comic book is about, like, he goes

1977
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
to defeat the ex-boyfriends

1978
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
who are, like, the seven bosses.

1979
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
Or, I shouldn't say they're not

1980
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
all ex-boyfriends.

1981
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
One of them's a girl, but still.

1982
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
It's like the harem of boss monsters

1983
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
that are the exes of this chick

1984
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
he's interested in. It's like the plot.

1985
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
And I'm like, that actually sounds, like,

1986
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
kind of awesome in an 11-year-old way.

1987
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
I want to go see it.

1988
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
Let's go see it.

1989
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
I think that movie does sound completely sweet.

1990
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
So I had no idea.

1991
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
Dan, take me on a date.

1992
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
I'm not dating all of you.

1993
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
Misty.

1994
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
Misty Wood.

1995
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
I'll take Mystique out on a date.

1996
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
Because Alan's in San Francisco, so Mystique

1997
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
can be my date.

1998
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
But no Nookie.

1999
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Rob's got jungle fever.

2000
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
If we call

2001
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
Alan, can we watch?

2002
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
Stop it.

2003
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
Stop it.

2004
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
They're filthy, disgusting pervs.

2005
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
You hang out with us.

2006
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
Xbox 360 in Japan. How about Japanese

2007
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
releases? I guess.

2008
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
Here's a sport they love in Japan. Baseball.

2009
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
Major League Baseball 2K10 is out from 2K Sports

2010
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
this week in Japan. And it can't even sell

2011
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
there.

2012
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
I think it does alright over there.

2013
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
I don't know. They're big, big.

2014
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
They got the big boner for baseball in Japan.

2015
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
Even bigger than here.

2016
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
MLB 2K.

2017
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
Sports of Japan.

2018
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
Sumo and Baseball.

2019
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
That might actually be their big release this week.

2020
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
But I have to say this. On the Nintendo Wii.

2021
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
It's not this week. It's coming out August 26th.

2022
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
But I'm sorry. This is the greatest name for

2023
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
video game ever. Are you ready for this?

2024
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
On the Wii. This is super spanking massage.

2025
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
Close. August 26th. You ready?

2026
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
Twinkle Queen.

2027
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
Wait.

2028
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
Are you sure that's not in the Twinkle Star Sprites

2029
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
family? I think it is.

2030
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
Even if it is.

2031
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
It's called Twinkle Queen. Oh no. It's a fighting game.

2032
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
It's a fighting game with chicks.

2033
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
Because we've never seen that before.

2034
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
That was like fun.

2035
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
That's on the 26th. That's not this week.

2036
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
But I just wanted to take a moment to acknowledge Twinkle Queen.

2037
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
It looks like the baseball game is the only big

2038
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
release in Japan this week. Oh no. I lied.

2039
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
On the PSP. Oh awesome.

2040
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
Corpse Party is the name of the game.

2041
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
Corpse Party Blood Covered

2042
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
Repeated Fear is coming out in a

2043
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
regular and limited edition.

2044
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
It looks like some type of survival-ish

2045
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
horror game with a very 8-bit style to it.

2046
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
And there's a chick.

2047
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
They're wearing Sakura uniforms.

2048
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
They're just wearing school girl uniforms.

2049
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
But I guess they're having a Corpse Party?

2050
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
I don't know.

2051
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
Remember last week that

2052
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
Scary Stories game came out.

2053
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
Oh that's right. But that was just like public domain

2054
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
stories on the DS right? Yeah.

2055
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
Kazoku Keikaku

2056
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
comes out on the PSP this week.

2057
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
It looks like the less scary alternative

2058
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
if you want to play.

2059
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
Because these girls are eating and this girl

2060
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
looks like she's farting on another one. I don't know what's happening there.

2061
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
But whatever.

2062
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
So it's family something.

2063
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
Maybe it's the family fucking something.

2064
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
Apparently this is the month of no men

2065
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
in Japan because none of these games

2066
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
have men in them. They're all girls.

2067
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
All the time. As it should be.

2068
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
By the way, from Robocoon

2069
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
in our chat room, I don't know if this is from Wikipedia

2070
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
or what, but giving us the background on

2071
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World.

2072
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
The series is about 23-year-old Canadian

2073
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
Scott Pilgrim, a slacker hero

2074
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
and part-time bassist who is living in Toronto

2075
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
and plays bass guitar in the band

2076
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
Sex Bob-omb. He falls

2077
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
in love with American delivery girl

2078
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
Ramona V. Flowers but must defeat her

2079
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
seven evil ex-boyfriends in order to date

2080
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
her. And that's the plot of the movie.

2081
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
That's cute. Oh it does sound cute. By the way

2082
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
Dan, will you defeat my seven exes

2083
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
to date me?

2084
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
That probably wouldn't be very hard. One of the

2085
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
rival bands in the game

2086
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
or in the comics is called

2087
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
Clash at Demonhead. Nice.

2088
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
See, that's how you knew that guy

2089
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
had a boner for video games.

2090
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
People don't know that game unless they're...

2091
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
Sex Bob-omb is awesome too.

2092
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
Clash at Demonhead, that's

2093
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
pretty obscure.

2094
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
That's awesome.

2095
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
The game is actually really, really cool

2096
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
by the way. Why are you having a Squeak, ArcSaga?

2097
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
Because I watched the trailer for this

2098
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
and I totally, totally, totally, totally, totally

2099
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
want this game. What are you talking about?

2100
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
Sonic Colors.

2101
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
Oh wow.

2102
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
What? The theme song

2103
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
is awesome. The theme song is

2104
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
Cheeseballtastic and I love it. But not good.

2105
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
But not in the way that everyone's

2106
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
Super Sonic Racing.

2107
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
But it's Sonic Colors

2108
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
is coming out. Oh dammit. I was trying to

2109
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
play it here in studio. There's a stupid ad on this.

2110
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
Hold on, we'll get through the ad and then we'll...

2111
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
It's not a good ad. It's a stupid ad. Well at any rate, in Europe

2112
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
the game is coming out November 12th

2113
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
and it's

2114
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
actually the Sonic Team

2115
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
head, Izuka Takashi

2116
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
is the

2117
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
big dude

2118
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
who is handling the game

2119
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
and it's pretty and it's really pretty.

2120
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
Happy, happy, happy, happy, happy.

2121
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
Look at this and tell me this is gorgeous.

2122
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
It looks cute.

2123
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
That's hit buffering.

2124
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
It did the same thing for me.

2125
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
Alright, whatever. There you go.

2126
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
Good enough.

2127
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
At any rate,

2128
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
it looks intensely, intensely

2129
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
fun.

2130
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
It reminded me just of how

2131
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
excited I was about Sonic Adventure.

2132
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
And there's no shadow.

2133
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
There's no all these other characters.

2134
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
It's just freakin' Sonic and Tails.

2135
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
It looks cute as hell. I'll give you that.

2136
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
SSG-100 Matt is in our chat

2137
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
room saying Rob's band, speaking

2138
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
of Scott Pilgrim's band and the Rival band.

2139
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
Rob's band is Boom Boom Kitty Fuck.

2140
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
I don't know where that comes from.

2141
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
That was from

2142
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
Jay.

2143
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
Can I call you Boom Boom Kitty Fuck?

2144
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
No, wasn't it?

2145
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
The nickname that he gave his...

2146
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
Boo Boo Kitty Fuck.

2147
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
There's a difference between Boom Boom and Boo Boo.

2148
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
It's crossed over with Boom Boom Dollar.

2149
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
The mashup of the century.

2150
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
That would be a great band name actually.

2151
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
Boom Boom Kitty Fuck. Boom Boom Dollar.

2152
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
That was almost the name of the show actually,

2153
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
but we went with Orange Honch Radio. It was almost

2154
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
Boom Boom Dollar Radio, but sadly.

2155
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
That would have been pretty bad. I actually

2156
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
want to say, no, I'm not fucking with you.

2157
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
That was on the list of names.

2158
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
In the long run, that would have been pretty bad.

2159
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
Finally, wasn't it? We should just do like

2160
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
Orange Lounge.

2161
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
I think it was the idea that we

2162
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
would be lounging around talking

2163
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
and it made sense. I had a

2164
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
migraine our first show.

2165
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
You didn't really start

2166
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
actually 100%

2167
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
being on the show until about the 4th or 5th

2168
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
episode. It's because I had to sleep in the Harry

2169
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
Potter closet.

2170
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
Remember? Yes. I was at the

2171
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
Gay Frat House. Good times.

2172
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
In the Harry Potter closet. True story people.

2173
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
By the way, if you want old episodes of

2174
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
OLR, they're out there.

2175
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
I'm going to warn you though, old OLR

2176
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
is nothing like new OLR.

2177
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
He means out there.

2178
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
It is just wow.

2179
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
Wow have we come a long

2180
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
way in 8 years. We haven't come far

2181
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
but it's still a long way.

2182
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
We've come away.

2183
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
We have evolved but the spirit lives on.

2184
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
If you listen to episode 1,

2185
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
it really is a lot like tonight's

2186
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
show actually where it just

2187
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
isn't really about anything.

2188
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
No, I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

2189
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
It was a lot shorter though. It was. We used to only

2190
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
have a 2 hour show and now we're like 4 hours.

2191
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
I don't know. Anyhow.

2192
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
Rob, more. More?

2193
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
How about more Sonic? I'll tell you more Sonic.

2194
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
It's a hack of Sonic 2.

2195
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
It's called the Dimps edition

2196
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
and it's a ROM hack of Sonic 2

2197
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
that apparently is supposed to make it more

2198
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
like Sonic 4 and there's actually this

2199
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
little trailer that's out there.

2200
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
It got flagged on YouTube.

2201
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
Denied. Oh well.

2202
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
There was a trailer out there on YouTube.

2203
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
It's actually available for download so you can hack the ROM

2204
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
there and what's weird

2205
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
about this though, they're not trying to do it

2206
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
to actually say like, oh hey we're

2207
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
excited for Sonic 4. No no.

2208
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
They're adding the features to try

2209
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
and point out how awful they are.

2210
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
I don't know though. I think there would be a lot of people

2211
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
that would get this to kind of like see the cool

2212
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
new features. I don't know. Sonic 4 didn't look terrible

2213
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
to me. But whatever. This is why I need Sonic

2214
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
colors. It's a very interesting form of protest.

2215
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
Did you miss that a couple shows ago?

2216
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
Matt brought that up. It's the Sonic

2217
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
cat that you get for pre-ordering it.

2218
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
And it actually looks like a... Pre-order!

2219
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
Alright. Don't look at

2220
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
me.

2221
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
Alright. Well speaking of classic games

2222
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
such as Sonic 2 and well really any

2223
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
Sonic in general.

2224
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
We like to take a trip through the

2225
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
gaming vault and find a classic

2226
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
game of the week. The Dark Sakura says hey

2227
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
listen

2228
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
you damn kids. You ought to be

2229
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
playing this game and showing a little

2230
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
respect.

2231
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
It's called the classic video game

2232
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
of the week. Dark Sakura what is

2233
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
tonight's classic video game of the week?

2234
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
Shadow Dancer. Specifically the Mega Drive

2235
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
slash Genesis version.

2236
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
Imagine that. A Genesis game inspired by

2237
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
your Genesis.

2238
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
Well. Um.

2239
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
Although I. Now this

2240
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
is one of the games that I had Dan

2241
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
playing for me last night.

2242
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
I love him.

2243
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
It's just

2244
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
Shinobi.

2245
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
It's actually. Dan this is my second

2246
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
shut up.

2247
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
Anyway. Um.

2248
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
This is

2249
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
this. This is the

2250
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
sequel to Shinobi and it actually is different than the

2251
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
arcade version. The Mega Drive

2252
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
version of Shadow Dancer. The secret of

2253
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
Shinobi. It came out on December 1st

2254
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
1990 in Japan. And

2255
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
the releases came out in North America and Europe afterwards.

2256
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
And it's on the virtual console.

2257
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
Um. And also in the

2258
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
Sega Genesis collection for PS2 and

2259
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
PSP. Dude that dog just ate that guys

2260
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
face. I know right. This one has a dog.

2261
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
What. You have a

2262
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
ninja dog.

2263
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
How freaking cool is that.

2264
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
Anyway. Um. The main guy

2265
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
did not have a name in

2266
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
the um. In the uh.

2267
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
Arcade version. And this one

2268
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
though he's called Hayate.

2269
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
And his dog is

2270
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
and he's actually supposed to be the son of

2271
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
Joe Musashi from

2272
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
the original Shinobi.

2273
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
Um. However

2274
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
that was in the Japanese version. In the US version

2275
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
he's just

2276
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
Joe Musashi. Um. The dog's name is

2277
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
Yamato.

2278
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
Did you know that was the traditional name of Japan?

2279
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
I do not.

2280
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
Now you know. That's why

2281
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
this ship was called Yamato.

2282
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
Anyway. Um.

2283
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
Anyway uh. They're trying to

2284
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
uh. Uh. Avenge

2285
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
this uh. The death of a guy

2286
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
named uh. Kato who

2287
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
was Hayate's mentor.

2288
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
Or Musashi's student depending

2289
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
on which version you're playing.

2290
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
Um. So yeah. Different stages. Different stuff.

2291
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
Um. Instead of looking for

2292
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
time bombs like you did in the uh.

2293
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
coin op one you rescue

2294
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
hostages. And

2295
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
your bonus one instead of being the first

2296
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
person ones are where you fall off

2297
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
of the building and shoot ninjas

2298
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
in the face with shuriken.

2299
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
Isn't that not amazing?

2300
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
And then they also did a

2301
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
Master System version that was out in Europe and Brazil

2302
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
because remember like we said. They love

2303
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
the Master System in Brazil.

2304
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
And um. But this one was

2305
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
actually a direct um. port

2306
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
of the arcade version.

2307
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
And it came out

2308
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
on the computer. For home computer

2309
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
by US Gold.

2310
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
And

2311
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
it's uh.

2312
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
Pretty. Pretty hardcore. And yeah I didn't

2313
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
do the first Kenobi because honestly I like this one better.

2314
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
Cause you have

2315
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
a ninja dog.

2316
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
Tell me.

2317
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
Dance in the other room and play ninja dog.

2318
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
That should just be a video game right there.

2319
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
Ninja dog. Yes.

2320
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
Alright. I want

2321
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
a ninja dog.

2322
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
And then I want my cat to be the big fat

2323
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
geisha.

2324
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
Is that it then? That's it?

2325
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
Yes. Alright. Classic game of the week is

2326
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
Shadow Dancer.

2327
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
I want to say you did like

2328
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
one of the other shinobi games before.

2329
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
I think I actually did shinobi before.

2330
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
You probably did. I want to say I've

2331
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
seen that in the uh. But Shadow Dancer is freaking

2332
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
amazing. Cause you have a ninja dog.

2333
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
I get the ninja

2334
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
dog thing. Dog.

2335
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
Alright. Named Yamato.

2336
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000

all the way from the

2359
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
east-ish coast. It's all the east coast

2360
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
to me even though she's really from the midwest

2361
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
but we had that talk a little earlier.

2362
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
But she flew out here to be with us so we really

2363
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
appreciate it. And we have tacos. Yes.

2364
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
And we are all eating Mystique's tacos right now

2365
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
and they're delicious I must say.

2366
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
It's great. So uh

2367
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
needs more salt though. No I'm kidding I'm kidding.

2368
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
Alright cause they're low sodium

2369
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
get it? Alright anyway. Uh

2370
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
no actually they were really good. I

2371
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
would never have guessed that they were any type

2372
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
of special diet tacos.

2373
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
Anyhow um

2374
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
I'm kind of tired today you guys and I

2375
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000

2376
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
um last night I actually

2377
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
I did something I've been wanting to do

2378
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
for like 10 years and

2379
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
never have had the opportunity to

2380
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
until last night. And

2381
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
um that was I went and saw

2382
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
Showgirls in a theater.

2383
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
It was

2384
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
Mystique is laughing.

2385
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
Mystique is just like they're bellowing.

2386
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
No here's the thing. Wait wait Mystique Mystique

01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
believe it or not when I was like 16.

2435
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
See I'm not surprised about that either. I had a girlfriend

2436
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
and her name was Chuck. No no

2437
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
shut up.

2438
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
Her she named her boobies

2439
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
and her boobies names get this

2440
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
I'm not even I am not making this up

2441
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
were Pebbles and Bam Bam.

2442
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
Wow.

2443
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
How is their names?

2444
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
Wow.

2445
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
Now we know why Rob is gay.

2446
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
You know what

2447
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
if dudes can name their junk

2448
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
women can name their tits.

2449
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
That's

2450
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
very true. It's a free country.

2451
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
Mine are just my

2452
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
boobs.

2453
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,000
The girls. Misty?

2454
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
I'm not even gonna ask. She'll

2455
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
throw that bottle of Mountain Dew at me. Alright

2456
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
uh let's see

2457
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
Now why would I waste mine and do like that?

2458
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
Frisbee says kibbles and bits.

2459
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
I want to know great

2460
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
boob names. Like I know that has nothing to

2461
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
do with gaming but I don't care.

2462
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
I need to know good boob names.

2463
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
So Dia says hers are named.

2464
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
Wait what are uh

2465
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
She's not saying what they are. Oh bummer.

2466
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
Come on. You open that bag.

2467
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
Now let the cat out.

2468
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
Alright. Tiger Claw

2469
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
says you can just call them bean bags because you know you

2470
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
want to sleep on top of them. That actually is one

2471
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
really good use of boobies. Like you know

2472
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
sometimes when you're watching a movie and cuddling

2473
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
with the fag hag there's you know boobies

2474
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
that you can kind of you know rest your weary

2475
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
head on. So there you go.

2476
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
I think boobs are great. They are.

2477
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
I think that they actually sell boob pillows in Japan.

2478
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
And wrist rest

2479
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
for your mouth so they are boobies.

2480
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
Oh I've seen the hand pillows.

2481
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
But they also sell laps that are like

2482
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
maids. Maids laps.

2483
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,000
For people

2484
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
to lean on and sleep.

2485
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
Interesting. It's that whole

2486
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
mole thing you know. Alright.

2487
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
Fair enough. Alright anyhow

2488
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
I don't know what that had to do with games but boy

2489
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
wasn't it fun. Alright. Man is a weird

2490
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
place.

2491
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
Let's see. Okay this is great.

2492
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
She said my left one is named

2493
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
Righty and the right one is named Lefty so the guy

2494
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
doesn't get confused.

2495
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
SSJ100 Matt says in chat

2496
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
see see see the religious

2497
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
fanatics and gays can both agree

2498
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
on the fact that boobs are fun.

2499
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
You know what we do you know

2500
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
all this propping debate. I can see your dirty

2501
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
pillows.

2502
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
What? Didn't you see

2503
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
Carrie? Do not want. Oh.

2504
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
Years ago. Years ago.

2505
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
They're all gonna laugh at you. Alright.

2506
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
No. They're all gonna

2507
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
laugh at you. Let's

2508
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,000
derail the show further shall we?

2509
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
And how. Alright let's get into Twitter topics.

2510
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
Let's let the listeners control

2511
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
the show with topics for a little bit.

2512
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
Sweet.

2513
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
Taco.

2514
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
You can't run out to get a taco while we're trying to do

2515
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
Twitter topics. She ran out to get a taco.

2516
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
This is not

2517
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
taco topics. It's Twitter topics.

2518
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
Taco time.

2519
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
Let's go Twitter topics. Alright.

2520
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
You ready Dan? I'm ready. There's a game

2521
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
Robocoon gets our first taco

2522
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
topic tonight. Saying that there is

2523
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
a game called Privates

2524
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
that is now out on the PC.

2525
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
This is the sex game.

2526
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
Yes this is the one

2527
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
where like I think you play these

2528
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
little sperm-y condom looking guys

2529
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
and yeah

2530
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
you have a Windows computer

2531
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
and

2532
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000
you can download this game now and

2533
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
I guess it's a game that teaches you about

2534
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
sex. Does it work with Kinect?

2535
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
No it's a PC game.

2536
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
For now.

2537
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
You never know.

2538
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000
Let's see TigerClaw

2539
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
305 sends us lots and lots

2540
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
of links tonight. We're going to do a

2541
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
couple of these here. First off

2542
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
I think this is actually

2543
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
really cool. All joking and laughing and boob

2544
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
talk aside this is actually a really great story here.

2545
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
The Kinect is going to be able to

2546
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
recognize sign language. As long

2547
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
as you're not sitting on the couch.

2548
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
The

2549
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
Kinect will actually recognize

2550
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
American Sign Language and

2551
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
it's due to a patent I guess that's out there.

2552
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
If you are proficient in sign

2553
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
language you can actually get the

2554
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
Xbox 360 to recognize

2555
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
the letters that you're doing in sign.

2556
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
That's a great way to learn too.

2557
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
Apparently though even if you don't know ASL

2558
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
you somehow will be able to

2559
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
lip read. That's pretty specific

2560
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
for the Kinect. That's also kind of scary

2561
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
if you think about it. They're saying

2562
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
that instead of voice chat you may be

2563
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
able to actually sign.

2564
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
You need to learn how to start signing all that

2565
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
foul language you hear on Xbox Live because

2566
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
that's what this will be useful for.

2567
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
I know how to sign.

2568
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
I know how to say bitch in sign language.

2569
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
I bet you do.

2570
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
I'm sure we know the same

2571
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
one Dan. This is less awesome

2572
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
but this is something that TigerClaw sends.

2573
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
It must be reported on. It is news.

2574
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
Billy Mitchell has taken back the

2575
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
Donkey Kong record.

2576
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
It happened on August 7th 2010.

2577
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
He reclaimed Donkey Kong

2578
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
and Donkey Kong Jr.

2579
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
Billy Mitchell is laying the smackdown.

2580
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
That's right. He is not to be

2581
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
fucked with. There it is.

2582
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
He's like Steve Weeby sucks.

2583
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
Whatever his name is. Hank Chien.

2584
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
The dentist. Goodbye.

2585
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
That's right. Off with you.

2586
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
It happened at Boomers Grand Prix Arcade

2587
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
in Florida verified

2588
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
live by Twin Galaxies

2589
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
Refs. That's it.

2590
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
2 hours and 42 minutes

2591
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
for Donkey Kong. 3 hours and 58 minutes

2592
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
for Donkey Kong Jr.

2593
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
I think I like this. He

2594
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
stopped right after he

2595
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
got past Hank Chien's score

2596
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
and Mitchell said

2597
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
quote, some say I'm being cocky.

2598
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
Some say I'm being lazy.

2599
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
I say I'm being Billy Mitchell.

2600
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
Well because he wants

2601
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
to have that record broken again.

2602
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
He wants to be

2603
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
able to keep one upping it because he really

2604
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
does know that he is

2605
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,000
that much better than everybody else

2606
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
at Donkey Kong.

2607
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
You know whether

2608
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
you love Mitchell or

2609
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
you hate him and you know you hate him. Everybody hates

2610
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
Billy Mitchell. The guy

2611
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
you know is the best in

2612
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
the world at that game.

2613
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
SSG100Matt sends us a tweet

2614
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
about NHL 11

2615
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
because we love sports games here at OLR.

2616
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
There's nothing we love more than sports games.

2617
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
And how?

2618
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
If I'm going to play a sports game, why are there all these

2619
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
giggling women in the other room?

2620
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
Mystique's on the phone with our friend Beanie and Beanie said they had

2621
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
tacos too.

2622
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
Is it Taco Day?

2623
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
The people in front of us at the supermarket

2624
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
were buying the ingredients were buying the stuff to make

2625
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
Mexican food.

2626
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
Did I miss the memo? I was not aware it was

2627
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
Taco Day. I thought Taco Day was

2628
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
Tuesday.

2629
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
You know who started that branding?

2630
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
Me. Did you? I started Taco Tuesday.

2631
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
I don't know.

2632
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
That was a Del Taco thing.

2633
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
I invented the internet.

2634
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
Can I talk about NHL 11?

2635
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
Yes.

2636
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
There is download content.

2637
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,000
It's all priced between 80 and 160

2638
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
Microsoft points.

2639
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
They're like player boosts where you can

2640
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
actually give yourself high boosts

2641
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
of 5 and 1 and 3 and so forth.

2642
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
Get this.

2643
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
156 different pieces

2644
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
of download content.

2645
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
Because EA doesn't have enough money.

2646
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
Well they needed to

2647
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
buy a soul.

2648
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
Apparently.

2649
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
What would EA do with a soul but

2650
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
sell it? I don't know. That's kind of screwed up

2651
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
I guess. For more Madden rights.

2652
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
Because really you're paying to basically make your characters

2653
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
better.

2654
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
Learn to play.

2655
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
SSG100 Matt

2656
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
in our chat says hockey is being derailed

2657
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
for tacos. Oh the humanity.

2658
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
Tacos.

2659
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
Frisbee gets kudos

2660
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
for saying Billy Mitchell. I'm number one

2661
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
at making sauce.

2662
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
Tacos own hockey.

2663
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
I'm saucy.

2664
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
For real he sells

2665
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
sauce on the internet.

2666
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
I love the idea of a new sport

2667
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
called Hocko's or Taki.

2668
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
Or Taki.

2669
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,000
And it would be hockey

2670
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,000
played with tacos.

2671
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,000
But they have to be like you know steal tacos.

2672
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,000
Yeah. Alright. Steal tacos.

2673
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
Blades of tacos.

2674
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
Blades of tacos.

2675
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
What's DS Master

2676
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
doing allowed in the chat? They skate

2677
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
on tacos.

2678
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
Wow.

2679
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
That would get messy.

2680
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,000
But that would be fun.

2681
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
I just can't DS Master.

2682
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,000
Have fun. Alright.

2683
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,000
Moving on. Let's see. What the hell is DS Master?

2684
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
Lame. Some guy.

2685
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
AK Ripper and USOC

2686
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
says this week's episode

2687
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,000
is awesome. Indeed.

2688
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
This is also AK Ripper's

2689
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
first time listening to Oella. No I'm kidding.

2690
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
Alright. He calls in a lot.

2691
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
Blue Swim sends us some

2692
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,000
tweets. I'm just getting into

2693
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,000
Dreamcast import gaming.

2694
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
Boy you're about

2695
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
15 years late now. I'm kidding. You want

2696
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
Blue Stinger. What DC

2697
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
games not already out in the US

2698
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
somehow are worth importing.

2699
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
The only Dreamcast imports I've got are

2700
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
Fire Pro Wrestling D and Giant

2701
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
Gram 2000. Which means he spent

2702
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
8 bucks.

2703
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
He probably downloaded them off the

2704
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
inner tubes. Actually the Japanese version of

2705
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
Blue Stinger is better than the US one.

2706
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
The Japanese version of Blue Stinger is much better

2707
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
than the US one. What about

2708
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
isn't it the Japanese? No that was on the

2709
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
Saturn. I was thinking Symphony of the Night but that's

2710
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
on the Saturn. Yeah that's on the Saturn. What other

2711
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
import awesome Dreamcast games are there?

2712
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
Hold on. There's yeah.

2713
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
Dark Soccer is going to the vault.

2714
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
There's almost too many to go into.

2715
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
Well while Dark Soccer runs to the vault

2716
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
I will take other tweets.

2717
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
She's going to come back with a bunch of terrible suggestions.

2718
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
Spazinator sends us a tweet.

2719
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
Apparently it's a leaked video

2720
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
of the Castlevania Lords of Shadow Game.

2721
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,000
Oh ha ha ha. He tried to

2722
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,000
Rickroll us but I had it on mute.

2723
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
That's why I usually don't

2724
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,000
click on YouTube links but he cleverly

2725
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
disguised it behind a bit.

2726
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
Kick him.

2727
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
I can't kick somebody off Twitter. If I could I would

2728
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
for that. No I would just

2729
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:01,000
kick him. I think everything

2730
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,000
in this box came out in the US.

2731
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000
And

2732
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,000
why do we have two copies of Capcom vs

2733
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,000
SNK? Because

2734
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,000
we're that awesome. No one

2735
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,000
of them's the pro edition.

2736
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
I gave him the best kick I could over Twitter.

2737
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,000
I just sent him a tweet that said THWACK.

2738
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,000
Boot to the head.

2739
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
Alright let's see.

2740
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
DJ Blazekin. Ever wonder what it would

2741
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,000
be like to have DJ Hero on the NES?

2742
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,000
No.

2743
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,000
Neither has anybody

2744
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
else. Well apparently

2745
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
there is actually out there in the world

2746
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
an 8 bit version of DJ Hero.

2747
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,000
This is the same guy. He downgraded

2748
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,000
some other games on the NES too. Here it is

2749
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,000
folks.

2750
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
These videos are always so bad

2751
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
it gives me cancer.

2752
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,000
What song is this?

2753
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,000
Hangin' Tough.

2754
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
What song is this?

2755
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,000
Oh it's

2756
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,000
Queen.

2757
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,000
This game

2758
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
sucks bad. Nobody bought

2759
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,000
it.

2760
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,000
You don't buy it Dan.

2761
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,000
It's a hack. No I'm just talking about

2762
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
DJ Hero.

2763
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,000
You have no idea how hard I tried to sell

2764
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,000
that game. You know what made it sell?

2765
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,000
When it went down to like 80% off

2766
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:25,000
it sold like crazy and now it's a hit.

2767
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,000
People bought it. Anyhow.

2768
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,000
One more tweet. Can I do one more tweet?

2769
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,000
By the way I did go through the box

2770
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
and I think everything that we have in the box

2771
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,000
came out in the US. But

2772
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,000
P.O.P.O. Da. I really like that game.

2773
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,000
Hide with Thunder.

2774
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,000
Someone imports Dan you dork.

2775
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:43,000
Well you can't say it and give Blue Swim at least

2776
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,000
one or two suggestions.

2777
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,000
Let's see.

2778
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:49,000
Orange Rite.

2779
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,000
Because it almost makes it sound like Orange

2780
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
L.R. is

2781
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,000
right or something like that. Orange Rite

2782
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,000
says his tweet saying Konami is

2783
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
going to have a DDR party at Royal Tea

2784
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,000
Cafe to celebrate their first DDR

2785
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,000
for the PS3. Naoki will be

2786
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,000
there live DJing. I did hear

2787
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
about this actually. Too far

2788
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,000
away or I would want to go. Yeah it's in Culver City

2789
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,000
California which is in SoCal. It's a little

2790
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
far especially for a weeknight because it's on August

2791
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,000
12th which is like this week.

2792
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,000
But hey if we have folks in the area

2793
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,000
by all means go. I'm going to try to send

2794
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,000
DJ Tyrant. He's in SoCal

2795
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000
and he's done some freelancing for the website so I'll

2796
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,000
see if he can go and like cover this

2797
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,000
for us. We don't have jobs we're going.

2798
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
No I'm just kidding.

2799
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,000
We ain't got no money.

2800
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,000
Oh I know you could use the show

2801
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,000
funds. Oh wait

2802
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,000
we don't have show funds.

2803
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,000
I've been too poor to donate.

2804
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,000
We had show funds once.

2805
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,000
Now we have a soundboard.

2806
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,000
And I got to go to California Extreme

2807
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,000
two years ago. Alright. Tiger Claw

2808
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,000
saying I missed one of his tweets. I'm sorry Tiger Claw

2809
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,000
there's a two tweet maximum. Too bad.

2810
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,000
How does it feel?

2811
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
Huh? Huh? Nah I

2812
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
I appreciate what Tiger Claw does for the show

2813
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
I do but I have to spread. It's not the

2814
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,000
Tiger Claw segment. It's the Twitter Claw

2815
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
Twitter Claw segment. I actually

2816
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,000
said the Twitter Claw segment.

2817
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
Shit. Alright.

2818
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,000
Totally missed my point.

2819
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
Tiger Claw contingency. Alright.

2820
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,000
How about more news shall we?

2821
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,000
And how? How about it?

2822
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,000
This is like freaky fucking

2823
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
scary to me. This reminds me of a

2824
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,000
scene in the Clockwork Orange and I don't like it.

2825
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
Although I love the name

2826
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
of the company who made this because their name

2827
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,000
is Waterloo Labs.

2828
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,000
Do you get it?

2829
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,000
Hold on I have to sorry for the dead air but I have to

2830
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,000
bring this up like I need I need music

2831
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,000
if I'm going to report on a story from Waterloo

2832
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
Labs here. This is mandatory

2833
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
that I have a story here.

2834
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
Alright no seriously Waterloo

2835
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,000
Labs they have developed

2836
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
an electrode system that actually

2837
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,000
measures your eye movement and

2838
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,000
uses it to control

2839
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
Super Mario Brothers.

2840
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
That's right. So look at this dude

2841
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
here. He actually has his eyes. Actually

2842
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:15,000
I'll stop the Abba here for a minute and the listeners

2843
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
rejoice. And you can actually watch

2844
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,000
this guy in this little video here.

2845
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,000
Alright blah blah blah blah blah.

2846
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000
Looks like they're in like a

2847
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,000
garage. Not like a

2848
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,000
garage like at your house.

2849
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,000
It's like when we were at the OLR

2850
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
studio. We are at the

2851
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,000
OLR studio. And it's just a

2852
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000
spare bedroom.

2853
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,000
Alright.

2854
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,000
It looks like these guys are in like

2855
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:45,000
their garage. It looks like they're in like a mechanics

2856
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,000
garage. It's hilarious. I don't want to see these

2857
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,000
guys like just talk about their stupid device.

2858
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,000
There we go. There's the guy playing. Oh my god

2859
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,000
he actually looks up to jump.

2860
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
And the guy does jump.

2861
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
That is and they

2862
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
kind of move their head a little bit though. That's kind of

2863
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
cheating. I bet he can't get to the line in this world.

2864
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,000
I'd like to see him run through 8-1

2865
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,000
always running like that.

2866
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,000
That is freaky to me.

2867
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,000
Oh see look at him die.

2868
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,000
Boo.

2869
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
Now Rob though you know they've had this before.

2870
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
What? The Atari Mindlink.

2871
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,000
Really? Yeah Atari in the

2872
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,000
80's marketed a controller

2873
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
that was going to play by your brainwaves.

2874
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
But it actually played by the way that you

2875
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
moved your head.

2876
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,000
Like your forehead? Yeah.

2877
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
It worked on your eyebrow muscles.

2878
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
Snake oil. Exactly. Never released.

2879
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,000
It was a

2880
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,000
famous vaporware.

2881
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
I don't think Waterloo Labs

2882
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,000
actually plans to do anything with this. Waterloo.

2883
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,000
I know right. Napoleon did

2884
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,000
surrender. Napoleon.

2885
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,000
Whatever

2886
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,000
it made for a great YouTube and got their little

2887
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
lab all over blogs and on

2888
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
our show so congrats. There you go.

2889
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,000
This website though that I

2890
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,000
tried to find the picture on it actually

2891
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,000
shows some Atari wireless

2892
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
controllers that have these big antennas and

2893
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,000
this thing and then an orthopedic shoe and it's

2894
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,000
labeled which one is the orthopedic shoe.

2895
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
It looks like

2896
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
somebody in our chat room MOTC

2897
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
I don't know if that's short for something. Sorry.

2898
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,000
Is like going crazy trying to get the DDR

2899
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
event information.

2900
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,000
So if you're going I want a phone call next

2901
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,000
week dude.

2902
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000
And by the way Orange Right actually

2903
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,000
joined our chat room and actually changed the name to

2904
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:23,000
Orange LR is right. So there we go.

2905
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,000
Alright. Thank you very much.

2906
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
Appreciate it. Well done sir. Well done.

2907
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,000
And Tiger Claw like the

2908
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,000
Google Ninja he is right there with the Wikipedia

2909
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,000
article to the Atari

2910
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:35,000
mind link. I want to see a picture

2911
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,000
of this thing and see if it was scary looking.

2912
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,000
I posted one in the chat room.

2913
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,000
Go to the Atari History Museum. Hold on. Hold on.

2914
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,000
The link is on the wiki page. Hold on.

2915
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,000
I'm on it. I'm on it. I'm on it.

2916
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,000
Let's see.

2917
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,000
Oh I see it. There it is.

2918
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,000
That looks dumb.

2919
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
It was. That made for

2920
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,000
great. It never worked.

2921
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,000
I guess there was a game called Mind Maze.

2922
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,000
Also that dude is wearing loafers with

2923
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,000
no socks.

2924
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,000
It was the 80's.

2925
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,000
MOTC has finals that night and can't

2926
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,000
attend the DDR party.

2927
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,000
Fire. Blow them off.

2928
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,000
Skip school. No I'm kidding.

2929
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:15,000
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

2930
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:17,000
Dark Sakura.

2931
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,000
What do you have for us? Stuff.

2932
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,000
Actually this is something that perhaps

2933
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,000
Dan might be interested in.

2934
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,000
Maybe. Maybe.

2935
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
Well actually it's

2936
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,000
he couldn't do anything with it because it's only

2937
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,000
for Europe.

2938
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
The European special editions

2939
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,000
have

2940
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,000
two special editions actually.

2941
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
There's the signature addiction

2942
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000
that's like the US collector's edition.

2943
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
It has a metal case.

2944
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
A miniature SLS AMG

2945
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
It comes with a toy car.

2946
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,000
Model car.

2947
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,000
It comes with a V6 engine.

2948
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,000
A USB flash drive.

2949
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,000
A wallet.

2950
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,000
And an entry into a contest to win a Mercedes-Benz.

2951
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,000
And vouchers for 11 download content

2952
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,000
vehicles. A key fob.

2953
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,000
An art book. A driving strategy

2954
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,000
mini magazine.

2955
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,000
And it's going to be

2956
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,000
$179.99.

2957
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,000
There's another special edition too.

2958
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000
It's all that stuff. It comes

2959
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,000
to the trunk of a Z06 Corvette

2960
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
and it costs $70,000.

2961
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,000
And then

2962
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
there's another one

2963
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,000
if you don't have as much money which is $79.99

2964
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,000
Euro.

2965
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,000
It's the collector's edition that has a slip

2966
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,000
cover.

2967
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,000
Some art cards.

2968
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
The download content

2969
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
vouchers and the driving magazines

2970
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
that came with the other version.

2971
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
So you can decide

2972
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
if you want to

2973
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,000
have the cool version

2974
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,000
or the oh my god can I win the Mercedes

2975
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,000
version. Well let's keep in mind that's Euro.

2976
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,000
So that's like what a buck and a half

2977
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
a buck seventy five per Euro.

2978
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
Or you could just buy the god damn

2979
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
game by itself and be happy with it.

2980
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
I'll do the conversion right now.

2981
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
I want to get the US collector's edition

2982
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,000
but I don't think I'm going to spring for it. What's in the US

2983
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
collector's edition?

2984
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,000
It comes with a toy car.

2985
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,000
Bunch of DLC. Art book.

2986
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,000
A book.

2987
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,000
Soundtrack. Just all kinds of

2988
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,000
stuff. And I like Gran Turismo

2989
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000
and after I'm like yeah

2990
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,000
yeah I'll do that. And I'm like what it's

2991
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,000
like 150 bucks?

2992
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
Jesus no.

2993
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,000
Alright going to another game

2994
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,000
that's coming out later this year here in the US

2995
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,000
and the UK. I think it's in the UK

2996
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,000
this year.

2997
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:31,000
240 bucks.

2998
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,000
Got some money.

2999
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,000
Hey a new mode in

3000
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,000
GoldenEye that kind of

3001
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
throws you back to an old mode. Here's the thing

3002
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,000
there used to be a mode if you remember in GoldenEye

3003
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
on the N64 it was called DK

3004
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
mode. And that was the mode where you would all

3005
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,000
have the giant heads.

3006
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:49,000
It made all the enemies

3007
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,000
and people in the game have these gigantic

3008
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
heads and they all had

3009
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,000
what they would call the proportions of Donkey

3010
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,000
Kong because at that time Rare

3011
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
was making of course this game and they were making

3012
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,000
the Donkey Kong games on Super Nintendo right?

3013
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:03,000
So is Donkey Kong mode coming back?

3014
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
No of course not stupid

3015
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
because Activision has the rights now and they

3016
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
don't own the rights to Donkey Kong.

3017
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,000
So it's not coming back. But

3018
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
what they did and this is clever

3019
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
they've decided to do a instead of big

3020
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,000
heads they now have

3021
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,000
big hands.

3022
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,000
That's right there's a big hands

3023
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,000
mode that can be activated in multi

3024
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,000
players and you get big hands

3025
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,000
and this is it. You can only melee

3026
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,000
people so it is bitch slap mode basically.

3027
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000
You can only bitch slap the other players

3028
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
with your giant hands.

3029
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,000
That is what it is.

3030
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,000
Awesome.

3031
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:39,000
There also by the way is a mode

3032
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
that makes everybody tiny that I believe was in the

3033
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
old game as well. There's a knick knack mode

3034
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
is what it's called. Am I alone in being

3035
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,000
a lot less interested in that game when

3036
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,000
they're like yeah we're going to redo GoldenEye.

3037
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
Yay. Oh we're

3038
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,000
going to take Pierce Brosnan out and we're going to put

3039
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
Daniel Craig in. Oh yeah that's

3040
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
that's

3041
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
interesting. That's not a big deal. Whatever.

3042
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:01,000
You see it was those Bond movies

3043
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,000
were fine. The new ones were fine. They're awesome.

3044
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,000
But GoldenEye is

3045
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
Brosnan's movie. I

3046
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,000
know it's weird but you know

3047
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,000
the multiplayer one is fun.

3048
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
I played it at E3

3049
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,000
and I'll just say it doesn't even matter. Brosnan's a whore

3050
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,000
for money. It's all about Odd

3051
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
Job anyway because he throws the hat

3052
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,000
and it's awesome.

3053
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,000
There's a shoe honestly. Honestly.

3054
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:25,000
You fight like a woman.

3055
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:27,000
Frisbee in our chat room is a little upset saying you

3056
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,000
can't claim ownership on big heads

3057
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,000
and hands etc.

3058
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,000
Maybe it was just they just didn't want to go there.

3059
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
It's too

3060
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
too close or something. The conglomerate

3061
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:39,000
that owns what's left of Midway should sue.

3062
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,000
Except it was a rare game.

3063
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,000
Not Midway. Right but Midway

3064
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,000
the big heads thing came along in NBA

3065
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:47,000
Jam.

3066
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:49,000
Back to NBA Jam again.

3067
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,000
Shut up Dan.

3068
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
Shut up Dan.

3069
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,000
Let's do another news story. Well

3070
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,000
for those who are looking forward to Pokemon Black

3071
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,000
and White that haven't already. Hey Dan here you go.

3072
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
And how?

3073
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,000
That haven't already imported it.

3074
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,000
Sorry.

3075
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:07,000
You um

3076
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,000
when you play through it the first time

3077
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
until you beat it you can only

3078
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,000
use the new Pokemon.

3079
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,000
You don't get the old Pokemons.

3080
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,000
No Pika.

3081
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:19,000
Pika. Not until you beat the game.

3082
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
Dan you can get some Pika.

3083
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,000
Look I understand why they're fighting

3084
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,000
like there's a lot of fucking Pokemon

3085
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:27,000
at this point right like how many Pokemon are there now

3086
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:29,000
like 700 fucking Pokemon or something like

3087
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,000
it's just it's insane and they're all

3088
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,000
starting to be like parodies of each other.

3089
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,000
I would under I would actually sympathize

3090
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,000
with Nintendo if they wanted to say hey look

3091
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,000
new game, new system

3092
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
or actually did they have another

3093
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,000
DS? Whatever. New way of playing, new game

3094
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,000
new Pokemon.

3095
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,000
Stop asking for the old shit. I still want an

3096
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,000
actual Pokemon MMO. But it's

3097
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:51,000
weird that they kind of put

3098
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:53,000
the Pokemon in there anyway at the end but I guess it's a

3099
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
reward to beat the game. I guess.

3100
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,000
There you go. I still want a Pokemon MMO

3101
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,000
I would play that. Every time there's a

3102
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,000
Pokemon story on this show somebody says

3103
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,000
why don't they make this an MMO already?

3104
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,000
That's a very good question. Because a Pokemon Momo would work.

3105
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:07,000
A Pokemon Momo?

3106
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,000
Is that like a

3107
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,000
Moomoo? Momo.

3108
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:13,000
A Pokemon MMO would be

3109
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000
great. It would be. But it would be weird

3110
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,000
because Nintendo in their

3111
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,000
mission to protect children across the

3112
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,000
world with friends codes how in the hell would an

3113
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,000
MMO work? And they keep it

3114
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,000
like kid friendly quote unquote.

3115
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,000
Would it be like the Disney game where you can only

3116
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:29,000
say certain phrases to people?

3117
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,000
That would have to be what would happen.

3118
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,000
That ain't my problem. I just think that a Pokemon MMO

3119
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:35,000
would work. Oh well okay.

3120
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:37,000
Screw the kids. That's right. Screw the

3121
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,000
kids. That's right Misty.

3122
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,000
I would play the Pokemon MMO

3123
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
while I ate my Nintendo cereal system

3124
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,000
in my Nintendo pajamas.

3125
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,000
It'd be awesome.

3126
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
Amen.

3127
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000
This is awesome. It's not Pokemon

3128
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,000
but it's almost as awesome. Torchlight

3129
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:55,000
is coming. Torchlight 2

3130
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
there's a sequel to the game Torchlight

3131
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,000
which if you haven't played honestly they've had this game

3132
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:01,000
on sale on

3133
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,000
Steam I don't know how many times

3134
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,000
and if you haven't picked it up by now you're a fool

3135
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:07,000
because this game is great. If you like

3136
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:09,000
I have a broken computer. I suppose

3137
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:11,000
that's an acceptable excuse. And you're a fool.

3138
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,000
But Diablo 2.

3139
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:15,000
Who doesn't like Diablo Diablo 2? If you like those

3140
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:17,000
games you're going to love Torchlight because it's basically half the

3141
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,000
same team. But they made this game Torchlight

3142
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
and they have announced that they are going to be doing a

3143
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,000
sequel. It's going to be in 2011.

3144
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,000
Multiplayer support.

3145
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:27,000
Yay! Because that's what the first game really

3146
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,000
badly needed. Torchlight 2

3147
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:31,000
is going to go above ground

3148
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:33,000
and it's now going to be on the continent of

3149
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000
Vilderand. There will still be

3150
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:37,000
deep caverns but there will also be

3151
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:39,000
weather, time of day cycles

3152
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,000
and random events. You're going to be able to play

3153
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:43,000
online and those of you

3154
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,000
that feel burned by Blizzard, LAN.

3155
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,000
LAN parties for Torchlight 2.

3156
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,000
There you go. That's great. It'll totally

3157
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,000
have features that every other game already has.

3158
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,000
Except Starcraft 2. Score!

3159
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,000
No you can't play

3160
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:57,000
Starcraft 2 in it.

3161
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,000
Well you can't play Starcraft 2 on LAN.

3162
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,000
They took LAN out of Starcraft 2.

3163
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,000
It's kind of a big deal.

3164
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,000
There will be a

3165
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,000
free peer to peer matchmaking service to meet

3166
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,000
new players of similar level

3167
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,000
and interest. Now I had heard

3168
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:13,000
that they were going to do an MMO about this.

3169
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:15,000
I guess that is also still in development.

3170
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:17,000
It's a free to play Torchlight MMO.

3171
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:19,000
This is not the same game.

3172
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,000
But there is a multiplayer Torchlight game

3173
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:23,000
on the way in 2011.

3174
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,000
I think that's exciting to me. I don't know about you guys.

3175
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,000
So there you go.

3176
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,000
So sweet. Alright.

3177
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,000
Well now is the mailbag part of the show except

3178
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,000
Jamie is not here so

3179
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,000
we're going to set the mailbag on fire ladies and gentlemen.

3180
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,000
That's going to be another news story.

3181
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,000
Damn! Where did I put my lighter?

3182
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:45,000
Every week DarkSakura opens up the email bag at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com

3183
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,000
and she reads some emails for us.

3184
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,000
We listen to them live

3185
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
as she reads them for us.

3186
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,000
So DarkSakura, why don't you go ahead and read us an email.

3187
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,000
This is some great radio right here.

3188
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,000
Mailbag? No it's not mailbag.

3189
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,000
I had another story.

3190
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,000
Not anymore.

3191
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:07,000
The music is playing. Read the mail.

3192
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:09,000
Come on get to it. Mail.

3193
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,000
Mail time.

3194
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,000
Mail call.

3195
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,000
Land shark.

3196
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:17,000
Mail call beats the booty call.

3197
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
Hey how you doing?

3198
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:21,000
The window is actually closed and I don't know who closed it so whatever.

3199
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,000
It was me.

3200
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:27,000
Okay we can go with that.

3201
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:29,000
Dan, why don't you pretend you're emailing OrangeLawnsRadio.

3202
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
What would you say in an email to OrangeLawnsRadio?

3203
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,000
Email's up. Dear Rob.

3204
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,000
Shut up Dan. Dan should be on this show way more often.

3205
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,000
For real Dan. Shut up.

3206
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:39,000
He is so cool and such a pimp.

3207
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,000
Hello all our crew. Blade3 here.

3208
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:43,000
Just wanted to say keep up the great work with the shows.

3209
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,000
I can't. Shows?

3210
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,000
We have more than one show?

3211
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
I can't live without them.

3212
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,000
You're show-wa.

3213
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,000
Not shows. Show-wa.

3214
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:55,000
I'd like more shows.

3215
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:57,000
Keep my week going and with school starting this week I'll need you more than ever.

3216
01:54:57,000 --> 01:55:03,000
And by the way PlayStation Move is stupid and I think Loki should smack everyone who buys one when he gets back thanks.

3217
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:05,000
Punctuation.

3218
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,000
Loki's never coming back.

3219
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:09,000
Yes he is.

3220
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,000
Oh god help us all.

3221
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:15,000
We have one show but I think he means shows as in you know there's been 377 episodes.

3222
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:21,000
Although I will say Extrofer and I really want to do the other show and I think I have a great concept now.

3223
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:27,000
Now that I don't have school on the nights you had available.

3224
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:29,000
I would like to do that still. It would be fun.

3225
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,000
I want to do a show.

3226
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,000
The Dan show.

3227
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:35,000
Not by myself.

3228
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:37,000
What would a Dan show sound like if Dan was by himself with a microphone?

3229
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:41,000
I have a mic. Words.

3230
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,000
See?

3231
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:45,000
The Dan and Mystique show.

3232
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:47,000
Oh shit.

3233
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:49,000
All who oppose us would perish.

3234
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:51,000
Second email.

3235
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:53,000
Greetings number one show in the continental US.

3236
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:55,000
We're the greatest in the galaxy.

3237
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:57,000
Yeah we're actually the greatest in the galaxy.

3238
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,000
Although when we had that decree.

3239
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,000
Do you have the decree?

3240
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:03,000
The decree does not say the number one.

3241
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,000
It just says the official.

3242
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:07,000
I had tape stuck to it.

3243
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:09,000
But I'll take number one.

3244
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,000
What is going on over there?

3245
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:13,000
Official decree.

3246
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:17,000
Orange Lounge Radio is the official video game podcast of the galaxy forever.

3247
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,000
It doesn't say number one video game podcast.

3248
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:21,000
But it is the official video game podcast.

3249
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:23,000
Which makes it number one.

3250
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,000
Now that we have been voted the number one show in the continental US.

3251
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:27,000
I guess Hawaii would beat us or something.

3252
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:29,000
Meaning like all those one up shows.

3253
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:31,000
Unofficial.

3254
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:33,000
Not official.

3255
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:35,000
Giant bomb. It's not official.

3256
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:37,000
Totally not official.

3257
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:39,000
Reading the email.

3258
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:43,000
I just heard a story on NPR about talks between Google and Verizon about paying extra for used bandwidth.

3259
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:49,000
Decided that people who stream video and music and especially online gamers will pay a lot extra for the bandwidth used.

3260
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:53,000
This is very troubling to me since I'm an online gamer primarily.

3261
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:59,000
Google seems to be the last straw and if they give in all the dominoes will start falling.

3262
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:05,000
I'm wondering why I haven't heard more of an outcry from the gamer community about this bandwidth issue.

3263
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:09,000
Since it has been behind the scenes for a while now.

3264
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:13,000
I also wonder what game studios and developers think of this.

3265
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:15,000
I don't know what I'll do if rates go up anymore.

3266
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:17,000
What do you guys think?

3267
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:19,000
I got this.

3268
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:21,000
Honestly you are the podcast I look forward to all week.

3269
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,000
Your loyal turtle in Philly.

3270
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,000
Serious turtle.

3271
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:27,000
Did you say turdie?

3272
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:29,000
Shut up.

3273
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:31,000
Wouldn't that come out as Tilly?

3274
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:33,000
Dan you had a comment on this email?

3275
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:37,000
Yes. The reason there's no outcry about it is because if it's going to happen it's going to happen.

3276
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:43,000
There's literally nothing you can do to stop the cable companies from eventually getting to charge you for bandwidth.

3277
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:45,000
Actually there is something you could do.

3278
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:47,000
Cancel your cable.

3279
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:49,000
Cancel your cable.

3280
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:51,000
Ultimately at the end of the day it's going to be your dollars that decide.

3281
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:59,000
Keep in mind. The other thing to keep in mind. Cable is slowly spreading through more and more neighborhoods and so forth.

3282
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:03,000
And if you're also willing to make the sacrifice to go to something like DSL which might not be as fast.

3283
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:09,000
You know perhaps there will be DSL competitors that are going to have an open internet that won't charge for this stuff.

3284
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:13,000
You know AT&T still competes with Comcast still competes with neighborhood providers and so forth.

3285
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:17,000
Don't get me wrong folks. I think this sucks too.

3286
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:23,000
But I'm just saying it might not be like you know eternal damnation for all of us.

3287
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:27,000
I mean like there's going to be a limit that people are going to hit and they'll just cancel it.

3288
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:31,000
Well because it's already started. The phone companies are doing it you know.

3289
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:38,000
But there will always be somebody out there who's going to say hey you pay a little bit more and you can be unlimited.

3290
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:44,000
The hope is that two things will happen. Number one competition will keep things cheap.

3291
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:49,000
You know because there is more than one answer.

3292
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:54,000
So if cable says okay we're charging you and DSL says oh no we're not.

3293
01:58:54,000 --> 01:59:00,000
You know everybody will jump over to DSL and cable will lose all their money so they'll come back around.

3294
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:06,000
The other thing that you're kind of looking at with the whole cable or with the whole unlimited bandwidth thing.

3295
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:11,000
Is that there are you know God help us government factions and that at work.

3296
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:19,000
Where the argument is that because the internet now is practically essential for life.

3297
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:23,000
That they'll get involved to keep price gouging from happening.

3298
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:25,000
You know but who knows what's going to happen.

3299
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:29,000
The truth is we're just going to have to you know gamers online people.

3300
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:35,000
You know the bit torrent people who are the ones who are really screwed it up for everybody by sucking down massive amounts of bandwidth.

3301
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:45,000
24-7, 365. Yeah you heard that. What's going to really happen is you know we're all going to have to deal with it.

3302
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:51,000
And hopefully yeah we don't get we don't get punked too hard.

3303
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:55,000
I would think they'd go after the torrenters first but I don't know.

3304
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:57,000
The thing is though everyone's a torrenter now.

3305
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:58,000
Yeah that's true.

3306
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:08,000
There's so many people who do it that you know it's one of their big ideas especially because you know Comcast now is a media conglomerate.

3307
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:19,000
So for them anything they can do to shut down a torrenter protects in their eyes their other you know their movie studio, TV studio, whatever connections.

3308
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:25,000
So you know they yeah they want the bandwidth plus you know anything they can get away with charging us a little bit more money.

3309
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:28,000
You know they want that money. Give me that money.

3310
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:29,000
Give me all your money.

3311
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:31,000
Give me all your money. Give me your money.

3312
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:34,000
Well that's is that it for the e-mail bag tonight?

3313
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:35,000
Yes it is.

3314
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:44,000
All right mail bag at orange lounge radio dot com if you want to send us an e-mail in the future and hopefully you won't have to pay extra money through Comcast or whoever your service provider is to do so.

3315
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,000
I know it's still free right now.

3316
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:51,000
In the meantime how about some angst, some anger, some FUs.

3317
02:00:51,000 --> 02:01:06,000
Hubba hubba hubba.

3318
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:09,000
FU to my software shield.

3319
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:12,000
I defeated you.

3320
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:17,000
And my hand for not being able to not hurt.

3321
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:20,000
I'm about to go take some Vicodin.

3322
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:30,000
My FU of the week goes to the fact that my weekend is almost over because I actually had a pretty awesome weekend between you know showgirls and other stuff.

3323
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:33,000
Just you know I'm sad but whatever.

3324
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:35,000
Life sucks.

3325
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:37,000
Life sucks you know.

3326
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:38,000
Shit happens.

3327
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:39,000
All right.

3328
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:41,000
Misty do you have FUs of the week?

3329
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:51,000
Kind of. It's just mostly to work drama and bullshit. I'm not even going to name specific names.

3330
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:55,000
Also to the fact that I have not won the lottery so I can't move out here yet.

3331
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:58,000
FU to not winning the lottery. I can sign off.

3332
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,000
Dan the man. Do you have some FUs?

3333
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:03,000
I got to throw an FU out to the economy.

3334
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:06,000
Believe it or not I miss having a job.

3335
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:12,000
Having a job was actually a great way to break up your day.

3336
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:13,000
And how.

3337
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:17,000
And besides that no not too many.

3338
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:19,000
FU to all who oppose me.

3339
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:21,000
Fuck you.

3340
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:23,000
I will fucking kill you.

3341
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:25,000
Back at you.

3342
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:27,000
Misty are you saying you oppose Dan?

3343
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:28,000
Don't oppose me.

3344
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:31,000
Uh oh. We might have a throw down.

3345
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:35,000
Trust me between now and Friday I can make your life a living heck.

3346
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:37,000
Alright.

3347
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:38,000
Not compared to work.

3348
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:41,000
Before we get back into the gaming news of which I have a story here.

3349
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:43,000
News about gaming? That's amazing.

3350
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:45,000
Soon we will get to the Skype line.

3351
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:49,000
And then the callers call in and it just all goes wild from there.

3352
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:52,000
Alright I want to ask Misty though.

3353
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:55,000
What do you have planned for your week while you're here?

3354
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:56,000
What are you going to do?

3355
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,000
What stuff do you have to see?

3356
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:03,000
Because I know when I think tourism I think Sacramento.

3357
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:07,000
I think we should go to the zoo.

3358
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:09,000
That would be nice.

3359
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:13,000
But yeah mainly obligatory Arviggle time.

3360
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:15,000
Sunrise for Para Para.

3361
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:17,000
Feed Jamie to a giraffe if you go to the zoo.

3362
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:19,000
No no no red pandas.

3363
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:22,000
Why would I do that? Dan maybe but not Jamie.

3364
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:27,000
Dan will get eaten by a Gru.

3365
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:31,000
Since when do they keep Gru's at zoos?

3366
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:33,000
Are you guys going to go to San Francisco?

3367
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:37,000
If we get enough people to help me with gas and parking.

3368
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:39,000
I think you guys will have fun.

3369
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:41,000
Because like Dan said we're pretty broke but.

3370
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:43,000
I don't know why your mic sucks but.

3371
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:44,000
How about this okay.

3372
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:45,000
Much better yes.

3373
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:49,000
If I have assistance with parking and everything and we eat cheap.

3374
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:52,000
And I don't completely blow my budget at Daiso.

3375
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:56,000
Or at Ichibancon then we should be fine.

3376
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:59,000
Sometimes you can find street parking it's just really rare.

3377
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:04,000
The garage is fine because honestly if you eat at like one of the little restaurants in there.

3378
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:05,000
They'll all validate.

3379
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:06,000
Oh Japantown?

3380
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:07,000
Yeah Japantown.

3381
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:09,000
Because I figured except I really kind of.

3382
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:12,000
Well except that one garage that I feel most secure going to.

3383
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:15,000
Is also the most expensive in the Castro.

3384
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:18,000
Because I totally want to go to Naya.

3385
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
The gelato place.

3386
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,000
You can go to Naya in Berkeley.

3387
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:23,000
You should go to hot cookie.

3388
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:24,000
You know what hot cookie is?

3389
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
It's the cookie store they sell cookies and underwear.

3390
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:27,000
And pantsu.

3391
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:29,000
They sell cookies and panties that's.

3392
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:30,000
Yep.

3393
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:31,000
Really it.

3394
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:32,000
Can't we just hit yogurt.

3395
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:36,000
Actually yogurt is right around the corner from my house.

3396
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:37,000
Exactly.

3397
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:38,000
I wish I could go with you gals but.

3398
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:39,000
I have to work.

3399
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:40,000
I don't have a lot of time.

3400
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:43,000
If I want to go to gay days this year I have to keep working.

3401
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:45,000
We'll get your man to entertain us.

3402
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:46,000
Alright.

3403
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:47,000
Anyhow back to gaming news then.

3404
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:49,000
Let's get into this story about Xfire.

3405
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:50,000
Do you guys remember Xfire?

3406
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:53,000
Because I was using Xfire a couple years ago then I like stopped.

3407
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:54,000
I do.

3408
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,000
Steam kind of took its place for me.

3409
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:59,000
But I guess there's still a lot of people using Xfire and Xfire is still around.

3410
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:03,000
But Xfire got bought this week.

3411
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:09,000
And they sent out a release to their 17 million users saying quote Xfire was bought by new owners today.

3412
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:13,000
Most of the team that has built Xfire over the last six years is leaving.

3413
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:18,000
We enjoyed working for you over the last 127 releases and wish we could stay to create the next 127.

3414
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
Good luck and.

3415
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:21,000
I'm sorry goodbye.

3416
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:22,000
Good luck and game on.

3417
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:27,000
That's kind of a thinly veiled like we just got bought and all laid off.

3418
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:28,000
That's kind of sad actually.

3419
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
Why did they get bought?

3420
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:34,000
Well they were bought by Titan Gaming and they're based out of Los Angeles.

3421
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:38,000
They have what's called skill based gaming technology.

3422
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:41,000
Read that as money competitive gaming.

3423
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:44,000
Titan will be taking on the Xfire name.

3424
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:48,000
They're going to focus on ongoing innovation in the gaming space.

3425
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:52,000
At least that's you know what the message says on their Titan website.

3426
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:56,000
Quote the Xfire services will continue uninterrupted for its users.

3427
02:05:56,000 --> 02:06:01,000
And it will help gaming companies better engage their users and monetize their games.

3428
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:03,000
Interesting.

3429
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:10,000
They're saying that this might be to try and position Titan Gaming to compete better with things like virgin gaming and so forth.

3430
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:16,000
But I believe the sound you're going to hear right now is millions of users canceling their Xfire accounts that they haven't already.

3431
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:20,000
I'm going to be honest. I haven't used Xfire since Steam came out.

3432
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
I was like Xfire? Really?

3433
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:23,000
I know.

3434
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:26,000
They got bought? Imagine that.

3435
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:27,000
There it goes.

3436
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:35,000
Tigerclaws says if you go to Xfire.com you can watch a bunch of live streams of people playing on it and it's mostly wow. Really?

3437
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:37,000
Man that's just what I want to see.

3438
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:42,000
Well let's go to Xfire.com right now and watch some a-holes play some wow.

3439
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,000
Let's see we're going to go to Xfire.com.

3440
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,000
To do live radio. I love this.

3441
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:51,000
Actually you know what? We need some theme music as we go to Xfire.com that was recently purchased by Titan.

3442
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:56,000
Benny Hill.

3443
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,000
This song works for practically everything.

3444
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:01,000
Videos. Live videos.

3445
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:02,000
Let's see here.

3446
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:05,000
There's Starcraft 2 going on live.

3447
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:07,000
Worst rogue priest in USA.

3448
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:09,000
That doesn't even make sense.

3449
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:10,000
How does that work?

3450
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,000
There's some people doing arenas.

3451
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:15,000
Yeah these are like all wow videos.

3452
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:22,000
I want to see worst rogue priest in the USA.

3453
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,000
Where is it?

3454
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:28,000
I clicked on it and nothing happened.

3455
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,000
This is the worst segment ever.

3456
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,000
Rob is fail at the internet.

3457
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:36,000
Clearly. Oh I clicked on the wrong link. This website sucks.

3458
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,000
Xfire live video.

3459
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:41,000
So now you're blaming the website.

3460
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:43,000
We're going to snoop in you guys.

3461
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:48,000
Cyclone.

3462
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:51,000
Cyclone.

3463
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:52,000
Roots.

3464
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:57,000
I'm casting cyclone. I'm casting roots.

3465
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:58,000
Needs more magic music.

3466
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:03,000
I got blind and uh.

3467
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:04,000
I'm getting drunk.

3468
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:07,000
I fucking just fell asleep right there in that little piece.

3469
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:12,000
I mean how much did they sell this website for? 40 bucks? Because that's about what it's worth.

3470
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:15,000
It's 20 more than I would have paid.

3471
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:17,000
Although I've got to say.

3472
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:21,000
Couldn't we just do our show on Xfire?

3473
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:23,000
There might be more.

3474
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:29,000
We could go on there and uh you know go on uh and do like a live wow stream and be all like hi you're listening to orange on video.

3475
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:32,000
Cyclone. Cyclone.

3476
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,000
Roots.

3477
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,000
And cyclone.

3478
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,000
Magic missile.

3479
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:41,000
I'm going to use intimidating shout.

3480
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:43,000
That really is a wow move actually.

3481
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:46,000
I know.

3482
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:49,000
Dan only knows that from watching South Park.

3483
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:51,000
Alright.

3484
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:55,000
No no see I didn't work in a video game store for 10 years or nothing.

3485
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:57,000
People might talk about Warcraft there.

3486
02:08:57,000 --> 02:09:02,000
In fact I banned my assistant manager from talking about Warcraft.

3487
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:06,000
He'd talk about Warcraft and I'd be like no I need you to do some work.

3488
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:09,000
So if he came into work one day and started going cyclone.

3489
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:12,000
You know what's amazing about that? That was live.

3490
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:17,000
That wasn't planned. That was actually happening right now somewhere.

3491
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:21,000
That just happened.

3492
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:23,000
Anyhow.

3493
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:28,000
One more story from Dark Sakura and one more from me and then we're going to open up the phone lines and if you thought cyclone was bad.

3494
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:30,000
Alright. Dark Sakura.

3495
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:33,000
Well Treasure actually.

3496
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:37,000
They are wanting to work on another 3D shooting game.

3497
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:41,000
And if you have really good programming skills and live in Japan.

3498
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:44,000
You actually might be able to make it.

3499
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:49,000
They have a job listing on their website looking for a new project 3D action shooting game.

3500
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:53,000
And they are advertising.

3501
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:56,000
Dude we should send this actually to Krista.

3502
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:59,000
Have her work for Treshar.

3503
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:02,000
I'm surprised you're not applying for this.

3504
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:04,000
I can't program shit.

3505
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:06,000
You can learn fast.

3506
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:07,000
I'm going to link this to Krista.

3507
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:11,000
You could lie about your qualifications like in Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead.

3508
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:15,000
That was great. Oh I see you graduated from Vassar.

3509
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:17,000
I'm right on top of it Rose.

3510
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:19,000
You know I saw that in the theater.

3511
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:20,000
Me too.

3512
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:22,000
The dishes are done man.

3513
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:25,000
Why are we quoting a movie that's like 20 years old?

3514
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:27,000
Because movies are awesome.

3515
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:31,000
We have some listeners that weren't even born yet when that movie came out.

3516
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:33,000
Fuck them.

3517
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:35,000
It's on DVD.

3518
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:37,000
Maybe.

3519
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:40,000
Well they've put worse shit on DVD from what I hear.

3520
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,000
I don't specifically know what but yeah.

3521
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:43,000
Alright.

3522
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:45,000
Let's talk Starcraft 2.

3523
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:46,000
And how.

3524
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:53,000
And Dan you better be careful because you know this house is prone to getting these spy bots and these bad things in it.

3525
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:56,000
And this is important to know about Starcraft 2.

3526
02:10:56,000 --> 02:11:00,000
Actually this is actually halfway serious because there are a lot of phishing scams out there.

3527
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:03,000
And I'm not talking about like phishing like you know.

3528
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:05,000
Reel her in.

3529
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:07,000
I'm talking phishing like P.H.

3530
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:08,000
Wow.

3531
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:09,000
I'm not like talking Dreamcast phishing.

3532
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:11,000
The great thing is he's looking right at me.

3533
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:12,000
I know.

3534
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:13,000
And he's saying that like I'm not going to understand.

3535
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:14,000
You need to understand.

3536
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:15,000
No Dan.

3537
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:16,000
Dan.

3538
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:17,000
Why aren't you looking at.

3539
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:18,000
Listen to the words.

3540
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:20,000
Why aren't you looking at DarkSakura over there.

3541
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:31,000
This spy bot search and destroy herself who's downloaded 15 viruses in the time that we've watched the show and managed to managed to kill them all.

3542
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:34,000
Then she's looking at me like she's hurt.

3543
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:39,000
She dumped like a gallon of bleach hypothetically into her computer to clean up any possible viruses.

3544
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:40,000
See that's what I'm saying.

3545
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:42,000
Yeah and you want to know exactly how it got rid of it actually.

3546
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:46,000
I finally ended up doing a Windows search finding the DLLs and deleting them.

3547
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:47,000
See.

3548
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:49,000
And what was the DLL called?

3549
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:50,000
Fuck if I can remember.

3550
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:51,000
There's also a few EXEs attached to it.

3551
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:52,000
But I got rid of them.

3552
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:53,000
I thought it was called STD.

3553
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:57,000
No the STD one was one that was among the list of those.

3554
02:11:57,000 --> 02:12:00,000
But the things that I have are from like last year.

3555
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:01,000
All the instructions.

3556
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:03,000
And the program has changed since.

3557
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:04,000
So they've renamed all the stuff.

3558
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,000
So I had to go back and find them.

3559
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,000
But I took care of it.

3560
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:11,000
It's like a Pokemon but STD.

3561
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:25,000
And it was also actually every time I would stop the process it would restart the process through a different database builder that I had built in.

3562
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:29,000
So I actually had to delete the database builder and the program.

3563
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:31,000
It's like Skynet yo.

3564
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:34,000
Did your computer become self aware?

3565
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:36,000
It touches itself Rob.

3566
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:37,000
Alright.

3567
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:39,000
Can I move on talking about Starcraft 2 here?

3568
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:40,000
It sure is aware of itself.

3569
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:41,000
If you must.

3570
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:47,000
Be wary because there are a lot of phishing emails going out there about certain Starcraft 2 promotions.

3571
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:54,000
For example if there's an email that you get about new free maps or a new mount for Warcraft.

3572
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:55,000
I guess this kind of crosses over.

3573
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:58,000
Or you know any type of extra Starcraft 2 stuff.

3574
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:05,000
They're trying to get your battle.net account info to try and get your activation key for the game.

3575
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:08,000
So be careful there's a lot of phishing emails out there.

3576
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:11,000
Obviously it's been going on in World of Warcraft 4 forever.

3577
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:16,000
Unfortunately Blizzard hasn't really been able to fight it outside of the authenticator.

3578
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:20,000
Which is a little silly that they've had to release this authenticator to protect accounts.

3579
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:23,000
I mean but unfortunately they're just so prone to getting hacked.

3580
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:24,000
I mean my own account was hacked.

3581
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:26,000
I mentioned earlier in the show.

3582
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:28,000
You know last year and it sucked.

3583
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:31,000
It was kind of like virtual rape.

3584
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:33,000
Like it was just my character.

3585
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:35,000
Somebody played my character.

3586
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:37,000
Played with my character when I didn't know.

3587
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:39,000
It's just very sad.

3588
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:42,000
What's ridiculous is it's the class of cybercriminal.

3589
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:45,000
You know they're just doing it to fuck with people.

3590
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:48,000
Because I mean really why wouldn't you just steal their bank account number.

3591
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:52,000
Or you know something where you could actually steal some money.

3592
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,000
Well a lot of times they do that too.

3593
02:13:54,000 --> 02:14:01,000
In fact there actually is a big login message in World of Warcraft now that says don't use the same password for Warcraft that you do any other website.

3594
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:04,000
Because if they get your password for Warcraft they'll get your other passwords too.

3595
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:08,000
Why is that funny?

3596
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:12,000
Because I could just see some guy putting in his password which is undoubtedly password.

3597
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:20,000
For his bank account and his World of Warcraft and his you know everything.

3598
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:24,000
And then being like oh my god I lost all my money.

3599
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:29,000
Oh but the real tragedy is they cleaned out my Warcraft character.

3600
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:31,000
You deserve it.

3601
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:36,000
Nobody deserves to have their Warcraft character raped.

3602
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:38,000
I'm sorry Rob.

3603
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:40,000
I know that hit a little too close.

3604
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:42,000
Well there may be a few people.

3605
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:46,000
Yes Monty Boggs in our chat room says did he touch your character in the swimsuit area.

3606
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,000
And I play a Tauren for heaven's sake.

3607
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:51,000
Yes he did touch the Tauren in the swimsuit area.

3608
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:54,000
That's how desperate these people are.

3609
02:14:54,000 --> 02:15:00,000
Alright Frisbee in our chat room says password 12345 to which Bonds006 says dammit now I have to go change my password.

3610
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:05,000
That's the same password I have on my luggage.

3611
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:14,000
The great thing is I read somewhere in this last week that they're cracking down on people who are having relations in World of Warcraft now.

3612
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,000
Why can't they go after these companies?

3613
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:20,000
Like I realize they're in another country or whatever but isn't Blizzard established in a lot of these other countries?

3614
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:22,000
Why don't they go after these guys legally?

3615
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,000
I mean it's a bad thing that they're doing.

3616
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:28,000
Well wait wait wait they have roleplay servers for a reason.

3617
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:30,000
Yeah well apparently they don't care.

3618
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:35,000
Because some 10 year old went wandering on into one of those roleplay servers I guess.

3619
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:39,000
Yes in a completely unrelated type of story although I think that's what you're referring to.

3620
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:46,000
Blizzard actually announced this week kind of unofficially on the forums they were going to patrol one of the servers a little more because of the roleplay.

3621
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:55,000
This server is kind of known for being the adult roleplay server and people like to roleplay in the tavern in Goldshire.

3622
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:56,000
Right that's what I read.

3623
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,000
And I can't remember the name of the server.

3624
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:00,000
You're in the tavern getting drunk.

3625
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:05,000
If there's any girls there I want to do them.

3626
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:11,000
But what's amazing about RP servers is that there's just as many griefers as there are actual RPers.

3627
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:14,000
So you can just imagine what these servers look like some days.

3628
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:16,000
You know that almost makes me want to play Warcraft.

3629
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:18,000
You just want to be a griefer.

3630
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:19,000
Oh yes.

3631
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:21,000
Oh no you want to do adult RP.

3632
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:22,000
Admit it Dan.

3633
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:24,000
I can do adult RP at home.

3634
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:25,000
Trust me bitch.

3635
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:26,000
Oh really now.

3636
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:27,000
Being an adult sucks.

3637
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:28,000
I'd rather do 10 year old RP.

3638
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:30,000
They'd be like why is your character sitting there on the ground.

3639
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,000
I'm playing with GI Joes.

3640
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:33,000
It's amazing.

3641
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:36,000
Lance of Longinus.

3642
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:42,000
If you want to give us a call 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

3643
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:44,000
The Skype line is open.

3644
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:48,000
1-877-GAME-OLR or OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype.

3645
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,000
Call and harass Dan for me.

3646
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:52,000
Game-olar.

3647
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,000
We should have a segment called Make Dan Laugh.

3648
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:55,000
Haha.

3649
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:56,000
Alright.

3650
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:58,000
That's not that hard.

3651
02:16:58,000 --> 02:16:59,000
Let's see.

3652
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:00,000
I'm known as Chuckles.

3653
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:04,000
Yeah SalaciousPop in our chat is following up with the details of the story there.

3654
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:07,000
There is one particular roleplay server that has been earmarked for erotic chat.

3655
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:09,000
Apparently it gets pretty explicit.

3656
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:10,000
Dude I want to play there.

3657
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:11,000
I love the word erotic.

3658
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:14,000
All level 5 toons in the human side starter in.

3659
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:21,000
Tigerclaw says speaking of Starcraft you have the story about Blizzard removing Starcraft 2 maps due to inappropriate content right?

3660
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:25,000
I did hear about that. All the wang maps and penis looking maps and you know.

3661
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:28,000
Quit making maps that look suggestive.

3662
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:30,000
Attack your balls.

3663
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:31,000
Alright.

3664
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:35,000
Hahahaha.

3665
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:37,000
You have to defend your zone.

3666
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:39,000
Haven't you heard like.

3667
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:41,000
Let's be honest. If the Zerg attacked your groin.

3668
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:51,000
Starcraft 2 apparently has these crazy like as modes where like you can like make RP games and like.

3669
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:53,000
Ooo erotic roleplay in Starcraft.

3670
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:54,000
Coming soon.

3671
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:55,000
Jesus.

3672
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:57,000
Yes my child.

3673
02:17:57,000 --> 02:17:59,000
Your soldiers are all really tiny.

3674
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:00,000
Let's go to the phones.

3675
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:01,000
I just don't see how that would be exciting.

3676
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:03,000
Hi you're on OrangeLion's radio. Who's this?

3677
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:05,000
Yo.

3678
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:06,000
Yo.

3679
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:07,000
Yo.

3680
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:08,000
What up?

3681
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:14,000
Hello there O.L.R. Speaking of which. Speaking of Swede. If it's that one. Swede.

3682
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:15,000
Ahem.

3683
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:18,000
It's our crazy Swede Aki Ripper is calling in.

3684
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,000
Jesus heck is this.

3685
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:21,000
Oh shut up.

3686
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:23,000
He's one of our official Swedes.

3687
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:25,000
Dan we have listeners all over the world.

3688
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:27,000
Oh he's. This is real.

3689
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:28,000
Yes this is a real guy.

3690
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:29,000
Yeah well.

3691
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:31,000
I thought that guy was just putting on a voice.

3692
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:33,000
No he's really. Well at least as far as we know.

3693
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:35,000
I'm pretty impressed now actually.

3694
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:39,000
No no no no. Dan I am from Sweden.

3695
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:44,000
Oh well that's a really bad example but well.

3696
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:46,000
He just went off on you in Swedish.

3697
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:47,000
How is the chef?

3698
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:49,000
That was hot.

3699
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:52,000
I have a question about Sweden I want to know.

3700
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:54,000
I have to know this.

3701
02:18:54,000 --> 02:19:00,000
Okay so in Sweden do you guys call Swedish fish just fish?

3702
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:01,000
No we don't.

3703
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:04,000
Because they're delicious and they're red.

3704
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:06,000
We don't fish.

3705
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:10,000
Well some of us do but it's like dying out.

3706
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:12,000
He said some of us do. Thank you.

3707
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,000
I'm glad that you confirmed that for me.

3708
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:18,000
But on the subject of fish though.

3709
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:20,000
Yes I will.

3710
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:28,000
Because I live in that part of Sweden where you know the thing where rotten fish is supposedly popular.

3711
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:33,000
Oh wait but it isn't rotten it's just like fermented beyond fermented.

3712
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:39,000
And yeah so called soothed minted.

3713
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:42,000
So do you guys like eat them or do you just smell them?

3714
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:47,000
Anyway what did you call in for tonight?

3715
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:48,000
What's the point?

3716
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:50,000
Dan stop egging him on.

3717
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:53,000
Dan Aki Ripper what did you call in to talk about tonight?

3718
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:55,000
That's what I said.

3719
02:19:55,000 --> 02:20:06,000
Well Blizzard still won't let me play Starcraft 2 but here goes the thing though.

3720
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:15,000
I tried to call their customer service two times and it was all busy.

3721
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:22,000
And I was like screw this I'm going to start playing Sims 3.

3722
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:24,000
Can you play Starcraft 1?

3723
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:39,000
And speaking of Sims 3 there has been like a few talks well in a recent tweet thing about the coming expansion.

3724
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:43,000
Sims late night or what is it no.

3725
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:48,000
Yeah Sims 3 late night the latest expansion or whatever.

3726
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:51,000
Is this with erotic roleplay as well?

3727
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:54,000
Sims late night sounds kind of kinky.

3728
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:55,000
Isn't that why they killed Sims Online?

3729
02:20:55,000 --> 02:21:00,000
Yeah Sims Online turned into just it was so sinful what was going on.

3730
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:01,000
Exactly.

3731
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:02,000
Sims Online.

3732
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:04,000
And that's what the Sims always comes into.

3733
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:08,000
Everyone who plays Sims is a pervo.

3734
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:11,000
Dan shut up I played Sims.

3735
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:17,000
Hold on hold on Aki Ripper I want to rewind a little bit because you're still mad at Blizzard and rightfully so.

3736
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:20,000
But I have some ideas for you on how to take your revenge on Blizzard.

3737
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:27,000
And one of them you just brought up this stanky rotten fish thing you need to send Blizzard a can of that.

3738
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:32,000
So is it like you can't play any Blizzard games can you play Starcraft 1 for example?

3739
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,000
I don't think it will help in a kind of way.

3740
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:46,000
And well one kind of thing that pisses me a bit off is that well while I have apparently some way on getting that authenticator.

3741
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:53,000
My current cell phone that I use don't support the authenticator unfortunately.

3742
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:56,000
Can you get the little physical one?

3743
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:58,000
What time is it in Sweden?

3744
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:00,000
It's three thirty in the morning.

3745
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:03,000
You talked about the Blizzard authenticator.

3746
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:05,000
Yeah the actual one not the mobile one.

3747
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:10,000
Which is available to some cell phones.

3748
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:20,000
My problem is that the current cell phone that I'm using at the moment I can't use that because it's not a symbian cell phone.

3749
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:25,000
I can remember they sell a stand alone one that's not just for cell phones.

3750
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:27,000
It's like you push a little button on it.

3751
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:29,000
Alan has one and I used to have one a couple years ago.

3752
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:32,000
It's like a physical authenticator you don't need a mobile phone for it.

3753
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:40,000
Which is good because I will most likely order that one instead of the one on a cell phone.

3754
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:42,000
AK Ripper we got to let you go to get more calls.

3755
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:44,000
Everybody was trying to get through to talk to Dan tonight.

3756
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:46,000
But thank you very much.

3757
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:47,000
Take care.

3758
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:49,000
Anyway once again for all.

3759
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:52,000
Your show rocks beyond the den.

3760
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:54,000
I love you AK Ripper.

3761
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:55,000
By the way one other suggestion.

3762
02:22:55,000 --> 02:23:02,000
Actually tonight since actually Dan and well Misty and all those guesses was quite fun.

3763
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:05,000
If you want to make Blizzard really upset.

3764
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:07,000
Threaten to take away Ikea.

3765
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:09,000
Right.

3766
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:11,000
Swedish people will.

3767
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:15,000
AK Ripper you take care buddy.

3768
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:17,000
Good luck with your Blizzard drama.

3769
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:18,000
Bye.

3770
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:22,000
Dude why do you think I've been listening for practically 300 episodes now?

3771
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:23,000
Good time.

3772
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:26,000
Hey you see that's what we should do tomorrow is go to Ikea.

3773
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:27,000
Ikea?

3774
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:29,000
You should go have meatballs.

3775
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:31,000
We're going to Ikea for lunch.

3776
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:32,000
I'm not.

3777
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:34,000
We got a call coming in.

3778
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:35,000
Hey behave.

3779
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:37,000
Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio who's this?

3780
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:38,000
Behave.

3781
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:39,000
This.

3782
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:41,000
Well this is.

3783
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:43,000
If you're from Sweden we're hanging out.

3784
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:44,000
Oh I can't understand.

3785
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:45,000
Dan.

3786
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:46,000
Shush.

3787
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:47,000
Just for a minute.

3788
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:49,000
You sit there and you shush.

3789
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:50,000
Okay.

3790
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:51,000
Okay sorry caller.

3791
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:52,000
I'm sorry.

3792
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:53,000
Hi Blaisekin.

3793
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:55,000
Okay hi Blaisekin how are you?

3794
02:23:55,000 --> 02:24:04,000
I'm doing fine and actually I'm kind of excited about the 3DS but not as much as if there

3795
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:08,000
were Beatmania or DJ Max coming to the PS3.

3796
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:09,000
Wait hold on.

3797
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:11,000
I got a real quick question for you.

3798
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:13,000
Where are you from?

3799
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:16,000
I'm straight out of Omaha, Nebraska.

3800
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:21,000
Stuck here in the middle of the United States of America with the best music arcade in America.

3801
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:22,000
Okay wait.

3802
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:23,000
Hold on.

3803
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:24,000
Hold that thought for a minute.

3804
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:25,000
Dan.

3805
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:26,000
He's from Omaha, Nebraska.

3806
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:27,000
That's not Sweden.

3807
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:28,000
That's not Sweden.

3808
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:30,000
I don't even think they have Ikea in Nebraska.

3809
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:31,000
Nebraska almost worse.

3810
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:32,000
Alright.

3811
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:33,000
Shush.

3812
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:34,000
Almost worse.

3813
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:35,000
I haven't been to Nebraska yet.

3814
02:24:35,000 --> 02:24:38,000
Keep in mind I'm going to be smacking him like a red-headed stepchild later.

3815
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:39,000
Alright.

3816
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:40,000
Can I help?

3817
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:41,000
The 3DS.

3818
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:46,000
Now you do know there is DJ Hero on the 3DS but I don't know if you're a fan of that.

3819
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:47,000
Actually do you know what?

3820
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:49,000
I made a sketch.

3821
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:54,000
About a few months ago while sitting in lunch at high school and trying to figure out because

3822
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:58,640
I kind of rumored you know how Guitar Hero came to the 3DS so I was kind of figuring

3823
02:24:58,640 --> 02:25:04,100
out how the heck they're going to pull off DJ Hero on 3DS and my thing was like the same

3824
02:25:04,100 --> 02:25:12,840
thing that they did for Guitar Hero but just put a miniature turntable into the GBA slot

3825
02:25:12,840 --> 02:25:17,480
with the buttons on there and then have the cross fader on the touch screen.

3826
02:25:17,480 --> 02:25:18,480
That's no GBA.

3827
02:25:18,480 --> 02:25:19,480
That's my idea.

3828
02:25:19,480 --> 02:25:20,480
That's no GBA.

3829
02:25:20,480 --> 02:25:21,480
You're really close.

3830
02:25:21,480 --> 02:25:23,920
The cross fader is on the touch screen so is the turntable.

3831
02:25:23,920 --> 02:25:24,920
That's how they do it.

3832
02:25:24,920 --> 02:25:25,920
Aww.

3833
02:25:25,920 --> 02:25:26,920
What?

3834
02:25:26,920 --> 02:25:28,400
There's no peripheral on the bottom.

3835
02:25:28,400 --> 02:25:29,400
I didn't play it.

3836
02:25:29,400 --> 02:25:34,040
I heard all this secondhand from Shane but seriously go listen to the E3 shows which

3837
02:25:34,040 --> 02:25:36,520
are still on iTunes and on the website.

3838
02:25:36,520 --> 02:25:37,520
Wednesday.

3839
02:25:37,520 --> 02:25:38,520
Tuesday.

3840
02:25:38,520 --> 02:25:39,520
No.

3841
02:25:39,520 --> 02:25:40,520
Tuesday's E3 show.

3842
02:25:40,520 --> 02:25:43,680
The first E3 show, whenever that was, we talked about DJ Hero on the 3DS because he actually

3843
02:25:43,680 --> 02:25:44,680
played it.

3844
02:25:44,680 --> 02:25:45,680
I missed it.

3845
02:25:45,680 --> 02:25:50,160
He was playing Ridge Racer on the 3DS which sucks balls.

3846
02:25:50,160 --> 02:25:51,160
Only balls?

3847
02:25:51,160 --> 02:25:52,160
Yeah.

3848
02:25:52,160 --> 02:26:00,040
Especially for steering unless you're using the little analog that they got on there.

3849
02:26:00,040 --> 02:26:02,160
That's how I play on the PSP.

3850
02:26:02,160 --> 02:26:06,920
I cannot stand on the touch screen too.

3851
02:26:06,920 --> 02:26:08,120
The collision was so weird.

3852
02:26:08,120 --> 02:26:12,040
When you run into your wall, the car would rotate like 15 degrees at a time.

3853
02:26:12,040 --> 02:26:13,040
It wasn't very smooth.

3854
02:26:13,040 --> 02:26:14,040
Oh.

3855
02:26:14,040 --> 02:26:15,040
It is Ridge Racer.

3856
02:26:15,040 --> 02:26:16,040
Anyway, wait.

3857
02:26:16,040 --> 02:26:17,040
Hold on.

3858
02:26:17,040 --> 02:26:18,040
This is the real question I want to ask.

3859
02:26:18,040 --> 02:26:21,840
DJ Blazekin said he was drawing this out while he was in high school, kind of doodling it

3860
02:26:21,840 --> 02:26:22,840
sounds like.

3861
02:26:22,840 --> 02:26:23,840
Okay.

3862
02:26:23,840 --> 02:26:27,960
I don't know about you but when I was of that age, in high school, in junior high and even

3863
02:26:27,960 --> 02:26:31,080
grade school a little bit, you know what we used to draw when we were bored?

3864
02:26:31,080 --> 02:26:35,680
We would draw out those little adventure games where you would draw your lair.

3865
02:26:35,680 --> 02:26:37,120
Don't you remember this?

3866
02:26:37,120 --> 02:26:38,360
Was this just me?

3867
02:26:38,360 --> 02:26:44,880
You draw out the lair and there might be a pit full of alligators and a vine and things.

3868
02:26:44,880 --> 02:26:52,600
It was basically a poor man's Dungeons and Dragons mixed with an 8-bit video game.

3869
02:26:52,600 --> 02:27:00,760
We made many, many poor graph paper, six sided die, ghetto RPGs.

3870
02:27:00,760 --> 02:27:03,760
And there would always be a woman with big boobies at the end of the maze that you were

3871
02:27:03,760 --> 02:27:08,080
trying to get to.

3872
02:27:08,080 --> 02:27:11,640
I don't know why I decided to talk about that but I did.

3873
02:27:11,640 --> 02:27:15,400
I wanted to do it back in my day story.

3874
02:27:15,400 --> 02:27:16,400
Okay.

3875
02:27:16,400 --> 02:27:23,720
You know how the new DJ Max Technical, which I haven't played yet, but the only thing near

3876
02:27:23,720 --> 02:27:34,400
to that we even have here in Omaha is DJ, or not DJ Max, BeatMania 13 Distorted is

3877
02:27:34,400 --> 02:27:35,680
what we got over here.

3878
02:27:35,680 --> 02:27:40,080
And I'll tell you this straight up, the Family Fun Center is what it's called over here.

3879
02:27:40,080 --> 02:27:44,080
They've kept a majority of their music games up and running like perfect health.

3880
02:27:44,080 --> 02:27:51,000
Now, I've got to give a giant F you to my local malls arcade because one of my favorite

3881
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:56,000
games down there, a music game in particular, In the Groove, which I play frequently when

3882
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:57,000
I go there.

3883
02:27:57,000 --> 02:28:00,640
Well, my mom's getting her nails done and whatnot.

3884
02:28:00,640 --> 02:28:02,640
That is one way to kill time.

3885
02:28:02,640 --> 02:28:05,080
Basically, it's down.

3886
02:28:05,080 --> 02:28:09,700
And the game's been out of commission for more than a month.

3887
02:28:09,700 --> 02:28:11,600
How long do you...

3888
02:28:11,600 --> 02:28:15,200
Do you ever go to the nail salon and inhale the fumes in there before you go play In the

3889
02:28:15,200 --> 02:28:16,200
Groove?

3890
02:28:16,200 --> 02:28:17,200
No.

3891
02:28:17,200 --> 02:28:18,200
I know.

3892
02:28:18,200 --> 02:28:19,200
It really, really improves the experience.

3893
02:28:19,200 --> 02:28:20,840
I was going to say, maybe that's what makes the game fun.

3894
02:28:20,840 --> 02:28:21,840
I'm just kidding.

3895
02:28:21,840 --> 02:28:22,840
No.

3896
02:28:22,840 --> 02:28:23,840
No, no, no, no, no.

3897
02:28:23,840 --> 02:28:28,560
But I usually have my own little USB flash drive with my custom songs on it to play on

3898
02:28:28,560 --> 02:28:31,120
it, which I have all the DDR soundtrack songs.

3899
02:28:31,120 --> 02:28:33,060
Oh, well that's cool, yeah.

3900
02:28:33,060 --> 02:28:36,840
That was pretty cool when they opened it up on that last patch to all the USB stuff.

3901
02:28:36,840 --> 02:28:37,840
That was neat.

3902
02:28:37,840 --> 02:28:38,840
I'll give you that.

3903
02:28:38,840 --> 02:28:43,320
Yeah, and here's the thing.

3904
02:28:43,320 --> 02:28:46,320
I'm actually visually impaired in one eye myself.

3905
02:28:46,320 --> 02:28:49,800
Black Wolf is not the only one that has a vision problem.

3906
02:28:49,800 --> 02:28:53,720
I'm kind of ultimately at the same point, because I can only see well in one eye.

3907
02:28:53,720 --> 02:28:58,200
Well, I can think of two listeners we have at least that have both eyes blind.

3908
02:28:58,200 --> 02:29:01,800
Didn't In the Groove get sued out of existence?

3909
02:29:01,800 --> 02:29:03,440
Yeah, it got sued.

3910
02:29:03,440 --> 02:29:06,600
It got annihilated by judgments, basically.

3911
02:29:06,600 --> 02:29:09,080
It was sued out of commission.

3912
02:29:09,080 --> 02:29:11,280
But that's a whole nother show.

3913
02:29:11,280 --> 02:29:16,640
In the Groove though, like players and DDRs, one, you didn't have a bunch of friggin background

3914
02:29:16,640 --> 02:29:23,720
videos going on with flashing arrows, which it's just like solid color arrows, no background

3915
02:29:23,720 --> 02:29:24,720
video.

3916
02:29:24,720 --> 02:29:26,920
It's way easier to see.

3917
02:29:26,920 --> 02:29:33,240
And even completely 2020 sighted players I've talked to say that it's better and easier

3918
02:29:33,240 --> 02:29:37,040
to play it in DDR for getting the notes.

3919
02:29:37,040 --> 02:29:38,040
Awesome.

3920
02:29:38,040 --> 02:29:39,040
All right.

3921
02:29:39,040 --> 02:29:41,840
We're going to let you go, dude, because we've got to get more calls.

3922
02:29:41,840 --> 02:29:44,200
But I got one last question for you guys.

3923
02:29:44,200 --> 02:29:45,200
Make it quick.

3924
02:29:45,200 --> 02:29:46,200
Make it quick.

3925
02:29:46,200 --> 02:29:50,000
Do you think there's a possibility of DJ Max Technica on the DS?

3926
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:53,560
I wouldn't hold my breath.

3927
02:29:53,560 --> 02:29:55,320
Anything is possible.

3928
02:29:55,320 --> 02:29:58,280
It's always about sales and how much those dev kits are going to cost.

3929
02:29:58,280 --> 02:30:01,840
I wouldn't expect it for at least a year because those dev kits are going to have to come down

3930
02:30:01,840 --> 02:30:02,840
in price a little bit.

3931
02:30:02,840 --> 02:30:04,240
So don't get your hopes up for right away.

3932
02:30:04,240 --> 02:30:07,080
All you got for right now is DJ Hero.

3933
02:30:07,080 --> 02:30:10,400
And if you're lucky, somebody will come up with another innovative music game.

3934
02:30:10,400 --> 02:30:16,840
Let's not forget the DS is what gave us Elite Beat Agents, which is basically DJ Max Technica.

3935
02:30:16,840 --> 02:30:18,800
I mean, right?

3936
02:30:18,800 --> 02:30:25,400
So I've never played Technica in the States and is now on sale with accessories for $9.99.

3937
02:30:25,400 --> 02:30:26,400
It has Flee.

3938
02:30:26,400 --> 02:30:27,400
That's a kickass song.

3939
02:30:27,400 --> 02:30:28,400
All right, buddy.

3940
02:30:28,400 --> 02:30:29,400
We're gonna let you go to get more calls.

3941
02:30:29,400 --> 02:30:30,400
You take care.

3942
02:30:30,400 --> 02:30:31,400
Have a good one.

3943
02:30:31,400 --> 02:30:32,400
Peace out.

3944
02:30:32,400 --> 02:30:33,400
Bye.

3945
02:30:33,400 --> 02:30:34,400
Bye.

3946
02:30:34,400 --> 02:30:35,400
Okay.

3947
02:30:35,400 --> 02:30:36,400
Let's go to another call.

3948
02:30:36,400 --> 02:30:37,400
Hello.

3949
02:30:37,400 --> 02:30:38,400
You're on Orange Lawn's radio.

3950
02:30:38,400 --> 02:30:39,400
Who's this?

3951
02:30:39,400 --> 02:30:40,400
Hey, this is X-Link.

3952
02:30:40,400 --> 02:30:41,400
Hi, X-Link.

3953
02:30:41,400 --> 02:30:42,400
Hi.

3954
02:30:42,400 --> 02:30:43,400
How are you?

3955
02:30:43,400 --> 02:30:44,400
Hey.

3956
02:30:44,400 --> 02:30:45,400
Doing good.

3957
02:30:45,400 --> 02:30:46,400
Awesome.

3958
02:30:46,400 --> 02:30:47,400
What's on your mind?

3959
02:30:47,400 --> 02:30:48,400
You know, it made me laugh when you're talking about the erotic chat.

3960
02:30:48,400 --> 02:30:49,400
And wow, it made me think of some of the stuff that some of the chats we have late at night

3961
02:30:49,400 --> 02:30:50,400
here on the guild.

3962
02:30:50,400 --> 02:30:51,400
Wow.

3963
02:30:51,400 --> 02:30:52,400
No, no.

3964
02:30:52,400 --> 02:30:53,400
No, no.

3965
02:30:53,400 --> 02:30:54,400
Hold up.

3966
02:30:54,400 --> 02:30:55,400
Ryan and I are in the same guild.

3967
02:30:55,400 --> 02:30:56,400
Yeah.

3968
02:30:56,400 --> 02:30:57,400
I picked that up real quick.

3969
02:30:57,400 --> 02:30:58,400
No, no, no.

3970
02:30:58,400 --> 02:30:59,400
They're dick and fart jokes.

3971
02:30:59,400 --> 02:31:00,400
They're not anything actually.

3972
02:31:00,400 --> 02:31:01,400
Yeah, whatever.

3973
02:31:01,400 --> 02:31:02,720
But the whole team is in the guild as well.

3974
02:31:02,720 --> 02:31:05,400
It only gets more and more kinky.

3975
02:31:05,400 --> 02:31:07,320
Let me guess.

3976
02:31:07,320 --> 02:31:09,360
Jamie's in there too, huh?

3977
02:31:09,360 --> 02:31:11,240
She was for like a day.

3978
02:31:11,240 --> 02:31:12,440
Everybody's been on this but me.

3979
02:31:12,440 --> 02:31:14,040
No, Rob, I got to level 20.

3980
02:31:14,040 --> 02:31:17,000
Why do I miss all the hot erotic chat?

3981
02:31:17,000 --> 02:31:18,000
You're on...

3982
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:19,000
Oh, don't worry, Dan.

3983
02:31:19,000 --> 02:31:20,000
It's your like.

3984
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:21,000
I also need a transcript.

3985
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:22,000
Dan, you are unemployed.

3986
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:23,340
Now is the perfect time to play WoW.

3987
02:31:23,340 --> 02:31:24,340
Exactly.

3988
02:31:24,340 --> 02:31:26,880
You're like the fourth person to that.

3989
02:31:26,880 --> 02:31:27,880
Rob, Rob, Rob.

3990
02:31:27,880 --> 02:31:28,880
What?

3991
02:31:28,880 --> 02:31:30,740
Dan lives with me, so he's going to be playing Star Trek online.

3992
02:31:30,740 --> 02:31:32,740
Oh sh...

3993
02:31:32,740 --> 02:31:34,740
Lock yourself in your room.

3994
02:31:34,740 --> 02:31:35,740
Get a laptop.

3995
02:31:35,740 --> 02:31:37,740
See this wallpaper?

3996
02:31:37,740 --> 02:31:38,740
Deep Space Nine.

3997
02:31:38,740 --> 02:31:40,740
I know. Star Trek Online.

3998
02:31:40,740 --> 02:31:41,740
It's okay.

3999
02:31:41,740 --> 02:31:42,740
You know what's terrible?

4000
02:31:42,740 --> 02:31:44,740
When I was a teenager, I was a Trekkie.

4001
02:31:44,740 --> 02:31:46,740
I mean hardcore.

4002
02:31:46,740 --> 02:31:48,740
The posters, the movies, you know,

4003
02:31:48,740 --> 02:31:50,740
knowing Klingon, the whole works.

4004
02:31:50,740 --> 02:31:52,740
It was a show.

4005
02:31:52,740 --> 02:31:54,740
It was the show on television.

4006
02:31:54,740 --> 02:31:56,740
Yeah. Well now, my wife,

4007
02:31:56,740 --> 02:31:58,740
ten years too late,

4008
02:31:58,740 --> 02:32:00,740
has decided that she's going to be a Trekkie.

4009
02:32:00,740 --> 02:32:01,740
No, no, no, no, no.

4010
02:32:01,740 --> 02:32:03,740
That would have worked out for me, you know,

4011
02:32:03,740 --> 02:32:04,740
years ago.

4012
02:32:04,740 --> 02:32:06,740
Now it's just like, really?

4013
02:32:06,740 --> 02:32:08,740
Star Trek? That's cute.

4014
02:32:08,740 --> 02:32:09,740
No, no, no, no.

4015
02:32:09,740 --> 02:32:11,740
Although admittedly I do kind of want some con cologne.

4016
02:32:11,740 --> 02:32:13,740
Did you take her to the tour that's at Mather?

4017
02:32:13,740 --> 02:32:14,740
No, we stopped to go.

4018
02:32:14,740 --> 02:32:15,740
I do want to go too.

4019
02:32:15,740 --> 02:32:16,740
I want to go too.

4020
02:32:16,740 --> 02:32:17,740
Keep in mind...

4021
02:32:17,740 --> 02:32:19,740
Keep in mind, I missed Deep Space Nine

4022
02:32:19,740 --> 02:32:21,740
when it was on TV.

4023
02:32:21,740 --> 02:32:23,740
I watched a few episodes here and there,

4024
02:32:23,740 --> 02:32:25,740
but I was also in school.

4025
02:32:25,740 --> 02:32:27,740
I had college to do.

4026
02:32:27,740 --> 02:32:29,740
So her and her friends come over

4027
02:32:29,740 --> 02:32:31,740
and they take over my big screen TV and my surround system

4028
02:32:31,740 --> 02:32:33,740
and they sit on my couch

4029
02:32:33,740 --> 02:32:35,740
and they watch Deep Space Nine on my big screen TV.

4030
02:32:35,740 --> 02:32:36,740
How is that a problem?

4031
02:32:36,740 --> 02:32:38,740
It's not a problem.

4032
02:32:38,740 --> 02:32:39,740
But all I'm saying is,

4033
02:32:39,740 --> 02:32:42,740
man, what happened when I would have enjoyed that?

4034
02:32:42,740 --> 02:32:44,740
Star Trek Online though, admittedly,

4035
02:32:44,740 --> 02:32:46,740
looks like a pretty neat game.

4036
02:32:46,740 --> 02:32:47,740
Okay, back to the caller.

4037
02:32:47,740 --> 02:32:48,740
Hi, caller.

4038
02:32:48,740 --> 02:32:49,740
Hi.

4039
02:32:49,740 --> 02:32:54,740
Anyway, so about those erotic chats, huh?

4040
02:32:54,740 --> 02:32:56,740
Yep, he does.

4041
02:32:56,740 --> 02:32:58,740
What did you call in to ask us about tonight?

4042
02:32:58,740 --> 02:33:00,740
He just wanted to remind you that you

4043
02:33:00,740 --> 02:33:01,740
erotically chat, Rob.

4044
02:33:01,740 --> 02:33:02,740
Oh, sorry.

4045
02:33:02,740 --> 02:33:04,740
He just wanted to bring up those late night chats

4046
02:33:04,740 --> 02:33:05,740
live on air.

4047
02:33:05,740 --> 02:33:06,740
I see how it is.

4048
02:33:06,740 --> 02:33:07,740
That's fine.

4049
02:33:07,740 --> 02:33:08,740
How dare you.

4050
02:33:08,740 --> 02:33:09,740
Let me read some of these transcripts.

4051
02:33:09,740 --> 02:33:10,740
All right.

4052
02:33:10,740 --> 02:33:11,740
No, seriously, let the man talk.

4053
02:33:11,740 --> 02:33:12,740
What's up?

4054
02:33:12,740 --> 02:33:15,740
No, I wanted to talk about the...

4055
02:33:15,740 --> 02:33:17,740
God, now I can't even think.

4056
02:33:17,740 --> 02:33:19,740
Now I got all derailed by the whole chat thing.

4057
02:33:19,740 --> 02:33:21,740
Yeah, welcome to my life tonight.

4058
02:33:21,740 --> 02:33:22,740
Welcome to OLR.

4059
02:33:22,740 --> 02:33:23,740
Jamie was like,

4060
02:33:23,740 --> 02:33:25,740
hey, Dan should host the show while Loki's gone.

4061
02:33:25,740 --> 02:33:26,740
I'm like, oh, sure.

4062
02:33:26,740 --> 02:33:28,740
That sounds like a great idea.

4063
02:33:28,740 --> 02:33:30,740
I think Dan's doing a great job.

4064
02:33:30,740 --> 02:33:31,740
Oh, no.

4065
02:33:31,740 --> 02:33:32,740
Dan's been fun.

4066
02:33:32,740 --> 02:33:33,740
Dan's fun.

4067
02:33:33,740 --> 02:33:34,740
Guess what?

4068
02:33:34,740 --> 02:33:35,740
What?

4069
02:33:35,740 --> 02:33:36,740
You get the hell out of my house.

4070
02:33:36,740 --> 02:33:37,740
You can host your story.

4071
02:33:37,740 --> 02:33:38,740
You can host it from your new car.

4072
02:33:38,740 --> 02:33:39,740
I don't know.

4073
02:33:39,740 --> 02:33:42,740
I think Rob could take you, Dan.

4074
02:33:42,740 --> 02:33:43,740
Yeah.

4075
02:33:43,740 --> 02:33:44,740
Dream on.

4076
02:33:44,740 --> 02:33:45,740
I didn't say how.

4077
02:33:45,740 --> 02:33:47,740
I just said I think you could.

4078
02:33:47,740 --> 02:33:49,740
Look, I don't even want to go into that conversation.

4079
02:33:49,740 --> 02:33:50,740
All right.

4080
02:33:50,740 --> 02:33:51,740
X-Link, hi.

4081
02:33:51,740 --> 02:33:52,740
This is getting inappropriate.

4082
02:33:52,740 --> 02:33:53,740
Where every gamer has a voice.

4083
02:33:53,740 --> 02:33:58,740
So anyways, how about those erotic chats?

4084
02:33:58,740 --> 02:34:00,740
What about it?

4085
02:34:00,740 --> 02:34:04,740
I believe you were going to ask something else until you were rudely derailed.

4086
02:34:04,740 --> 02:34:06,740
Um, no.

4087
02:34:06,740 --> 02:34:08,740
No, I can't think of what it is now.

4088
02:34:08,740 --> 02:34:10,740
So I'm just going to leave it at that.

4089
02:34:10,740 --> 02:34:11,740
All right.

4090
02:34:11,740 --> 02:34:12,740
Well, have a great week, X-Link.

4091
02:34:12,740 --> 02:34:13,740
Erotic chats.

4092
02:34:13,740 --> 02:34:15,740
Thanks for the call, I think.

4093
02:34:15,740 --> 02:34:16,740
All right.

4094
02:34:16,740 --> 02:34:17,740
Have a good one.

4095
02:34:17,740 --> 02:34:18,740
It was good to talk to you.

4096
02:34:18,740 --> 02:34:20,740
You too.

4097
02:34:20,740 --> 02:34:21,740
I enjoyed that.

4098
02:34:21,740 --> 02:34:26,740
He sounded like a good guy.

4099
02:34:26,740 --> 02:34:27,740
I hate this show.

4100
02:34:27,740 --> 02:34:28,740
All right.

4101
02:34:28,740 --> 02:34:29,740
1-8-7.

4102
02:34:29,740 --> 02:34:30,740
You're loving it.

4103
02:34:30,740 --> 02:34:31,740
I do love this show.

4104
02:34:31,740 --> 02:34:32,740
You've got a big smile on your face.

4105
02:34:32,740 --> 02:34:33,740
I do.

4106
02:34:33,740 --> 02:34:34,740
This is fun.

4107
02:34:34,740 --> 02:34:35,740
All right.

4108
02:34:35,740 --> 02:34:36,740
1-8-7-7 game.

4109
02:34:36,740 --> 02:34:37,740
O-L-R.

4110
02:34:37,740 --> 02:34:38,740
username on Skype is orange.

4111
02:34:38,740 --> 02:34:39,740
But see, now here's the thing, though.

4112
02:34:39,740 --> 02:34:44,740
When Loki comes back, you guys, you have to say, oh, the show sucked when you weren't

4113
02:34:44,740 --> 02:34:45,740
there.

4114
02:34:45,740 --> 02:34:48,740
Like, it just wasn't working without you there.

4115
02:34:48,740 --> 02:34:50,740
Because I don't want him to feel.

4116
02:34:50,740 --> 02:34:51,740
You know what's weird, though?

4117
02:34:51,740 --> 02:34:52,740
The show.

4118
02:34:52,740 --> 02:34:53,740
He's probably listening to us.

4119
02:34:53,740 --> 02:34:54,740
You know he's not coming back.

4120
02:34:54,740 --> 02:34:57,740
The show is always better when one of us is missing.

4121
02:34:57,740 --> 02:35:04,740
Like, you know Jamie missed episode 69, which was that epic night that Loki sang the karaoke

4122
02:35:04,740 --> 02:35:06,740
revolution, and it's like one of our greatest movies ever.

4123
02:35:06,740 --> 02:35:07,740
He sang I'm Staying In.

4124
02:35:07,740 --> 02:35:08,740
And I was gone.

4125
02:35:08,740 --> 02:35:09,740
Nice.

4126
02:35:09,740 --> 02:35:13,740
I was gone one night, and this show just totally, like, I don't even know what happened.

4127
02:35:13,740 --> 02:35:19,740
Like, they were watching a Ron Jeremy biography live on air and commenting on it.

4128
02:35:19,740 --> 02:35:23,740
You wait until 378 when we pay all our mad libs.

4129
02:35:23,740 --> 02:35:25,740
Wait, which episode is it?

4130
02:35:25,740 --> 02:35:26,740
It will be epic.

4131
02:35:26,740 --> 02:35:28,740
All right, can we take another call, please?

4132
02:35:28,740 --> 02:35:29,740
No.

4133
02:35:29,740 --> 02:35:30,740
Of course.

4134
02:35:30,740 --> 02:35:31,740
Hi.

4135
02:35:31,740 --> 02:35:32,740
Who said no?

4136
02:35:32,740 --> 02:35:33,740
Misty.

4137
02:35:33,740 --> 02:35:34,740
Misty's the new director.

4138
02:35:34,740 --> 02:35:35,740
Veto.

4139
02:35:35,740 --> 02:35:36,740
Producer.

4140
02:35:36,740 --> 02:35:37,740
I'm taking the call.

4141
02:35:37,740 --> 02:35:38,740
All right, I'm hanging up.

4142
02:35:38,740 --> 02:35:39,740
No, I'm kidding.

4143
02:35:39,740 --> 02:35:40,740
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio.

4144
02:35:40,740 --> 02:35:41,740
Who's this?

4145
02:35:41,740 --> 02:35:43,740
Hi, this is your friendly neighborhood Rick Roller spazzing eater.

4146
02:35:43,740 --> 02:35:44,740
Hi, spazzing eater.

4147
02:35:44,740 --> 02:35:45,740
It didn't work.

4148
02:35:45,740 --> 02:35:46,740
I had the sound off.

4149
02:35:46,740 --> 02:35:47,740
Haha.

4150
02:35:47,740 --> 02:35:48,740
What's up?

4151
02:35:48,740 --> 02:35:53,740
Well, after a couple of years of having that on, I know I kind of relate to the whole Rick

4152
02:35:53,740 --> 02:35:56,740
Roller thing, but I figured you've got to do it at least once.

4153
02:35:56,740 --> 02:36:01,740
But at any rate, two little tidbits of information.

4154
02:36:01,740 --> 02:36:07,740
I probably wonder what you may already know about, but I can't figure you would like to

4155
02:36:07,740 --> 02:36:11,740
know about since you're really big on the music-based games.

4156
02:36:11,740 --> 02:36:22,740
From what I've heard through the grapevine, supposedly DDR is coming to both the 360 and

4157
02:36:22,740 --> 02:36:25,740
PlayStation 3.

4158
02:36:25,740 --> 02:36:35,740
I don't really follow DDR at all, so I don't know which version of DDR is coming to the

4159
02:36:35,740 --> 02:36:44,740
other versions, but since I know the two of you are into DDR, I kind of figured the fact

4160
02:36:44,740 --> 02:36:49,740
that it's coming out to newer systems may pique your interest.

4161
02:36:49,740 --> 02:36:53,740
Sure, spazzing eater, actually, spazzing eater, I've got the perfect answer to your question

4162
02:36:53,740 --> 02:36:57,740
actually because we actually have a friend that works at Konami that can actually answer

4163
02:36:57,740 --> 02:37:02,740
this question and tell us some of the differences between the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3

4164
02:37:02,740 --> 02:37:03,740
version.

4165
02:37:03,740 --> 02:37:05,740
So let's head on over to my friend who's going to tell us.

4166
02:37:05,740 --> 02:37:06,740
That's right, motherfucker.

4167
02:37:06,740 --> 02:37:07,740
How's it feel?

4168
02:37:07,740 --> 02:37:08,740
How's it feel?

4169
02:37:08,740 --> 02:37:09,740
Oh, bitch!

4170
02:37:09,740 --> 02:37:10,740
What?

4171
02:37:10,740 --> 02:37:11,740
What?

4172
02:37:11,740 --> 02:37:12,740
Who's Rick Wall and who now?

4173
02:37:12,740 --> 02:37:13,740
He's no stranger to love.

4174
02:37:13,740 --> 02:37:14,740
Yeah, that deserved a Pikachu beatdown.

4175
02:37:14,740 --> 02:37:15,740
All right.

4176
02:37:15,740 --> 02:37:16,740
I just got smacked with a Pikachu.

4177
02:37:16,740 --> 02:37:17,740
All right.

4178
02:37:17,740 --> 02:37:18,740
I've got troubles on my screen, Rob.

4179
02:37:18,740 --> 02:37:19,740
Squeeze.

4180
02:37:19,740 --> 02:37:20,740
Squeeze.

4181
02:37:20,740 --> 02:37:21,740
Squeeze.

4182
02:37:21,740 --> 02:37:22,740
Squeeze.

4183
02:37:22,740 --> 02:37:23,740
Squeeze.

4184
02:37:23,740 --> 02:37:24,740
Squeeze.

4185
02:37:24,740 --> 02:37:25,740
Squeeze.

4186
02:37:25,740 --> 02:37:26,740
Squeeze.

4187
02:37:26,740 --> 02:37:27,740
Squeeze.

4188
02:37:27,740 --> 02:37:28,740
Squeeze.

4189
02:37:28,740 --> 02:37:29,740
Squeeze.

4190
02:37:29,740 --> 02:37:30,740
Squeeze.

4191
02:37:30,740 --> 02:37:31,740
Squeeze.

4192
02:37:31,740 --> 02:37:33,740
I've got troubles on my screen, Rob.

4193
02:37:33,740 --> 02:37:34,740
Squeeze.

4194
02:37:34,740 --> 02:37:36,740
When Rob gets smacked with a Pikachu, he usually makes something else.

4195
02:37:36,740 --> 02:37:37,740
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

4196
02:37:37,740 --> 02:37:38,740
Where did you put Angus?

4197
02:37:38,740 --> 02:37:40,740
What the hell are you talking about?

4198
02:37:40,740 --> 02:37:41,740
Who's Angus?

4199
02:37:41,740 --> 02:37:42,740
My trouble.

4200
02:37:42,740 --> 02:37:43,740
It was in the blue bucket.

4201
02:37:43,740 --> 02:37:45,740
Damn, don't tell me right away about another trouble.

4202
02:37:45,740 --> 02:37:46,740
Hey, hold on.

4203
02:37:46,740 --> 02:37:48,740
Angus is in the closet.

4204
02:37:48,740 --> 02:37:49,740
Hold on.

4205
02:37:49,740 --> 02:37:51,740
Spazinator actually had a question.

4206
02:37:51,740 --> 02:37:53,740
I may or may not want to answer it.

4207
02:37:53,740 --> 02:37:55,740
About what DDR version.

4208
02:37:55,740 --> 02:37:56,740
Here's the thing, Spazinator.

4209
02:37:56,740 --> 02:37:58,740
Actually, this is my honest answer.

4210
02:37:58,740 --> 02:38:03,740
As far as these DDR games go, the new ones that are coming out, we don't know a lot about them, period.

4211
02:38:03,740 --> 02:38:14,740
That's what makes this press event that's happening this week so interesting is because we had all this information about the Xbox and PlayStation DDRs coming out, and then suddenly there was nothing for a while.

4212
02:38:14,740 --> 02:38:21,740
But I think what happened is that at E3, then we saw Dance Masters come out, and Dance Masters is a Xbox 360 game.

4213
02:38:21,740 --> 02:38:28,740
So that the PlayStation 3 users have something, here is my guess, and I honestly believe this is the honest-to-God truth.

4214
02:38:28,740 --> 02:38:36,740
The game that was going to come out on the 360 and PlayStation 3 now canceled on the 360 in favor of Dance Masters.

4215
02:38:36,740 --> 02:38:42,740
But for those folks that don't have a 360, you get Dance Dance Revolution on the PlayStation 3.

4216
02:38:42,740 --> 02:38:44,740
I honestly kind of think that's where things went.

4217
02:38:44,740 --> 02:38:50,740
And it's really hard to say if this new PlayStation 3 game is going to be good or not until we know more about it.

4218
02:38:50,740 --> 02:38:59,740
From what we heard a couple years ago, it's like a greatest hits, a lot of the famous songs and some new ones, lots of DLC, eight-panel dancing.

4219
02:38:59,740 --> 02:39:07,740
It certainly makes it sound like it's going to be leaps and bounds better than the 360 games that already exist, because there is Universe 1, 2, and 3.

4220
02:39:07,740 --> 02:39:17,740
But I think the PlayStation 3 one, you know, it's the first DDR game, I'm not even acknowledging the Wii ones because they're ridiculous, but it's the first real DDR game we've had in a couple years.

4221
02:39:17,740 --> 02:39:23,740
And if they've actually rebuilt it from the ground up and so forth, it might be kind of cool. That's my thoughts.

4222
02:39:23,740 --> 02:39:35,740
Yeah, as someone that's never touched a music game aside from some of the older Guitar Hero games and the Rock Band games, I'm willing to at least give it a try.

4223
02:39:35,740 --> 02:39:45,740
Granted, I know it's hard core into that series as you guys are, but I'm willing to give anything a try, you know?

4224
02:39:45,740 --> 02:39:57,740
Faznator, before you go buy DDR on the PlayStation 3, which will cost you at least $60, honestly, if you want to try it and see if you like it, you can find dance games on the PlayStation 1.

4225
02:39:57,740 --> 02:40:00,740
Because I don't think you have a 360. Do you have a 360?

4226
02:40:00,740 --> 02:40:01,740
Yeah, I do.

4227
02:40:01,740 --> 02:40:07,740
Oh, okay, well then never mind. You can go buy a cheap dance pad for like no more than 20 bucks.

4228
02:40:07,740 --> 02:40:11,740
And you could probably, like Dark Sakura found the fancy dance pads at a local discount store.

4229
02:40:11,740 --> 02:40:12,740
I bought three of them for six bucks.

4230
02:40:12,740 --> 02:40:19,740
Yeah, they're like super cheap. So if you look at like discount stores and stuff, you might find them even cheaper, but no more than 20 bucks for a cheap game pad.

4231
02:40:19,740 --> 02:40:25,740
And like DDR Universe 2 at GameStop, I shit you not, I saw it in a bin the other day, $7 used.

4232
02:40:25,740 --> 02:40:40,740
So I would say for 27 bucks, try it. And if you think the game is fun and you're like, hey, I want like a more souped up version of this, this is kind of fun, this is getting me moving and burning calories, then drop the 60 bucks on the PlayStation 3.

4233
02:40:40,740 --> 02:40:46,740
But if you're not sure, Spaznator, don't spend more than 30 bucks doing the trial run.

4234
02:40:46,740 --> 02:40:54,740
Because you're still getting a decent game out of it. It's not that the 360 games are bad, they're not. They're just, you know, they're dated at this point.

4235
02:40:54,740 --> 02:41:06,740
Yeah, I'll definitely look into it. It's going to be a while before I buy even a used retail game because money is kind of, you know, tight at the moment.

4236
02:41:06,740 --> 02:41:19,740
But before I do let you go, there's one more thing I just want to pass along. I don't know if it's on the Xbox marketplace just yet or not.

4237
02:41:19,740 --> 02:41:41,740
It's been a couple days since I checked it. But at least over on the game side of the PSN store, there is, you know, I guess it amounts to a half hour long machinima movie that Rockstar Games had made using Red Dead Redemption.

4238
02:41:41,740 --> 02:41:43,740
Interesting.

4239
02:41:43,740 --> 02:41:59,740
Yeah, totally free download, will cost you a cent. And it clocks in at literally 29 minutes and 6 seconds. I just gave it a brief looking over and it looks kind of decent.

4240
02:41:59,740 --> 02:42:11,740
You know, if Rockstar is behind it, they have a great writing team, so it's probably pretty good. Especially if it's just a video, I don't see why it's not on the 360. I haven't looked, but I don't see why it wouldn't be there.

4241
02:42:11,740 --> 02:42:29,740
Yeah, based on the description I read on the video itself towards the end, the half hour movie is supposed to serve as a prequel to the actual game.

4242
02:42:29,740 --> 02:42:37,740
Alright. Well, Spaznado, we're going to let you go so we can take more calls or wrap the show up. I don't know what we're going to do yet, but have a good one buddy, okay?

4243
02:42:37,740 --> 02:42:39,740
Yep, you too. Take care.

4244
02:42:39,740 --> 02:42:49,740
Alright. It was good to not hear a horror story about the Playstation 3 from Spaznado for a week. It was some positive news. He's keeping it positive tonight for you, Dan.

4245
02:42:49,740 --> 02:42:51,740
He's thinking of playing DDR.

4246
02:42:51,740 --> 02:42:54,740
Are we going to take more calls? Producer Misty, are we taking more calls or fuck them?

4247
02:42:54,740 --> 02:42:56,740
I hope so. Depends on who we get though.

4248
02:42:56,740 --> 02:43:09,740
Alright. Producer Misty says call if you want to try. You have to audition now to be on the show. You have to get through Misty to be on the show.

4249
02:43:09,740 --> 02:43:14,740
1-877-GAME-OLR. Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

4250
02:43:14,740 --> 02:43:17,740
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

4251
02:43:17,740 --> 02:43:18,740
Hey, it's Rama.

4252
02:43:18,740 --> 02:43:26,740
Hold on, hold on. Before we take your call, Rama. Producer Misty, is there anything you want to make Rama do to see if we can take his call tonight or not?

4253
02:43:26,740 --> 02:43:29,740
No. I thought that it was him, so he's cool.

4254
02:43:29,740 --> 02:43:30,740
Take off your pants.

4255
02:43:30,740 --> 02:43:31,740
Yodel!

4256
02:43:31,740 --> 02:43:33,740
Eat my terrible cooking.

4257
02:43:33,740 --> 02:43:36,740
Your cooking isn't terrible.

4258
02:43:36,740 --> 02:43:37,740
Misty's our Nakane.

4259
02:43:37,740 --> 02:43:41,740
You have a lovely taco.

4260
02:43:41,740 --> 02:43:48,740
Mystique is our local fusion of Nabiki and Akane, so she's our Nakane.

4261
02:43:48,740 --> 02:43:50,740
She agrees.

4262
02:43:50,740 --> 02:43:53,740
Yeah, you guys are starting to scare the living shit out of me right now.

4263
02:43:53,740 --> 02:43:54,740
That's alright.

4264
02:43:54,740 --> 02:43:55,740
Good.

4265
02:43:55,740 --> 02:43:56,740
God dammit.

4266
02:43:56,740 --> 02:43:58,740
Wait, you just tuned in, didn't you?

4267
02:43:58,740 --> 02:44:01,740
Yes, I just tuned in and got rick rolled. I'm like, what the hell?

4268
02:44:01,740 --> 02:44:07,740
I just want to say, this show, like, yeah.

4269
02:44:07,740 --> 02:44:10,740
This show has been awesome.

4270
02:44:10,740 --> 02:44:12,740
I've been doing backflips over the shark all evening.

4271
02:44:12,740 --> 02:44:15,740
It has much more Dan than any other show has ever had.

4272
02:44:15,740 --> 02:44:17,740
I mean, really, I'm on the road with...

4273
02:44:17,740 --> 02:44:20,740
And the promise of Orange on the Road with Mad Libs.

4274
02:44:20,740 --> 02:44:23,740
I'm on the road with DDR Darla Bill. We're coming back from somewhere.

4275
02:44:23,740 --> 02:44:27,740
And I get a text from Gio saying that her boobs got nicknames now.

4276
02:44:27,740 --> 02:44:33,740
I'm fiddling with my phone, trying to get the stream to work with no avail.

4277
02:44:33,740 --> 02:44:35,740
You're trying to get the stream to work.

4278
02:44:35,740 --> 02:44:37,740
You know, they make some medicines.

4279
02:44:37,740 --> 02:44:39,740
Stop it. Stop it right now.

4280
02:44:39,740 --> 02:44:42,740
Rama, I'm so sorry for Dan.

4281
02:44:42,740 --> 02:44:44,740
He's met Dan before.

4282
02:44:44,740 --> 02:44:46,740
Yes, I have.

4283
02:44:46,740 --> 02:44:48,740
He slept at my house.

4284
02:44:48,740 --> 02:44:51,740
Dude, Dan just pitched Pikachu.

4285
02:44:51,740 --> 02:44:52,740
Can we ask what Rama...

4286
02:44:52,740 --> 02:44:54,740
I've met Rama before too.

4287
02:44:54,740 --> 02:44:55,740
Yes.

4288
02:44:55,740 --> 02:44:57,740
Can we ask Rama why he called in tonight?

4289
02:44:57,740 --> 02:44:58,740
We all know Rama.

4290
02:44:58,740 --> 02:44:59,740
Instead of consistently derailing this call.

4291
02:44:59,740 --> 02:45:00,740
Yes, Rama?

4292
02:45:00,740 --> 02:45:06,740
I didn't have much to contribute except for the fact that DJ Hero bundles are now 40 bucks at Best Buy.

4293
02:45:06,740 --> 02:45:07,740
Sweet.

4294
02:45:07,740 --> 02:45:09,740
Now they'll sell a million more.

4295
02:45:09,740 --> 02:45:12,740
I went online earlier this morning and ordered mine.

4296
02:45:12,740 --> 02:45:18,740
And I went to check other places because it seems that Kmart was the first one to do when I was trying to get a price match.

4297
02:45:18,740 --> 02:45:19,740
But Best Buy has it.

4298
02:45:19,740 --> 02:45:26,740
But I find it funny that GameStop is selling their bundles for $49.99 online only in stores still 100 bucks.

4299
02:45:26,740 --> 02:45:28,740
On related news to that.

4300
02:45:28,740 --> 02:45:31,740
This is a great example of how failed the PS3 is.

4301
02:45:31,740 --> 02:45:40,740
At Fry's, the Super Deluxe Logitech Guitar Hero controllers. The drum and the guitar. 50 bucks a piece.

4302
02:45:40,740 --> 02:45:41,740
Wow.

4303
02:45:41,740 --> 02:45:42,740
So I'm looking at that.

4304
02:45:42,740 --> 02:45:43,740
Are you serious?

4305
02:45:43,740 --> 02:45:44,740
Yes, because those are $200 controllers.

4306
02:45:44,740 --> 02:45:47,740
I'm looking at that and I'm like, if they have $360 ones, they're bought.

4307
02:45:47,740 --> 02:45:48,740
They are bought.

4308
02:45:48,740 --> 02:45:51,740
Find the $360 ones, they're still $200 bucks.

4309
02:45:51,740 --> 02:45:58,740
Because honestly, not for nothing, I would drop $200 bucks on the Logitech ones instead of buying the Mad Catz ones.

4310
02:45:58,740 --> 02:46:02,740
I don't care what anyone says. Mad Catz controllers and accessories are pieces of shit.

4311
02:46:02,740 --> 02:46:03,740
You don't say.

4312
02:46:03,740 --> 02:46:06,740
Frisbee in our chatroom says Toys R Us is at 40 bucks as well.

4313
02:46:06,740 --> 02:46:08,740
Their Street Fighter stakes are pretty nice.

4314
02:46:08,740 --> 02:46:16,740
I will say though guys, if you're at all interested in DJ Hero 2, now's the time to go get your controller.

4315
02:46:16,740 --> 02:46:17,740
Yeah.

4316
02:46:17,740 --> 02:46:20,740
And get practically a free DJ Hero 1 with it.

4317
02:46:20,740 --> 02:46:21,740
Yeah.

4318
02:46:21,740 --> 02:46:23,740
There you go. Yeah.

4319
02:46:23,740 --> 02:46:24,740
Yeah.

4320
02:46:24,740 --> 02:46:28,740
Or if you're smart, you buy two bundles and you trade them in one game.

4321
02:46:28,740 --> 02:46:29,740
I'm not smart.

4322
02:46:29,740 --> 02:46:31,740
I just went cross-eyed.

4323
02:46:31,740 --> 02:46:32,740
All right.

4324
02:46:32,740 --> 02:46:34,740
Rama, thanks so much for your call, buddy.

4325
02:46:34,740 --> 02:46:36,740
Anything else you want to share quickly tonight?

4326
02:46:36,740 --> 02:46:38,740
No, that's it.

4327
02:46:38,740 --> 02:46:39,740
All right. Bye.

4328
02:46:39,740 --> 02:46:40,740
Peace.

4329
02:46:40,740 --> 02:46:41,740
All right.

4330
02:46:41,740 --> 02:46:42,740
All right.

4331
02:46:42,740 --> 02:46:44,740
I think that's going to do it for phone calls tonight, guys.

4332
02:46:44,740 --> 02:46:45,740
We got to wrap up.

4333
02:46:45,740 --> 02:46:46,740
I'm glad Rama called.

4334
02:46:46,740 --> 02:46:47,740
I was hoping for him to call.

4335
02:46:47,740 --> 02:46:48,740
I'm looking at Baby.

4336
02:46:48,740 --> 02:46:50,740
Apparently he wasn't really listening most of the night.

4337
02:46:50,740 --> 02:46:51,740
Baby.

4338
02:46:51,740 --> 02:46:52,740
Baby.

4339
02:46:52,740 --> 02:46:53,740
Baby.

4340
02:46:53,740 --> 02:46:55,740
That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Laundry.

4341
02:46:55,740 --> 02:46:56,740
Do we have any last minutes?

4342
02:46:56,740 --> 02:46:57,740
Baby.

4343
02:46:57,740 --> 02:46:58,740
Loki's Baby, I know.

4344
02:46:58,740 --> 02:46:59,740
Baby.

4345
02:46:59,740 --> 02:47:00,740
You can post that in chat.

4346
02:47:00,740 --> 02:47:01,740
It's a public blog.

4347
02:47:01,740 --> 02:47:02,740
Okay.

4348
02:47:02,740 --> 02:47:03,740
Yeah.

4349
02:47:03,740 --> 02:47:04,740
It is adorable.

4350
02:47:04,740 --> 02:47:05,740
Actually, I think a picture of Nellie and Baby is on orangelaundry.com.

4351
02:47:05,740 --> 02:47:07,740
Like in the little flicker thingy at the top.

4352
02:47:07,740 --> 02:47:08,740
I think so.

4353
02:47:08,740 --> 02:47:09,740
Yeah.

4354
02:47:09,740 --> 02:47:10,740
So check it out if you want to see the Baby.

4355
02:47:10,740 --> 02:47:11,740
All right.

4356
02:47:11,740 --> 02:47:12,740
That's going to do it.

4357
02:47:12,740 --> 02:47:13,740
That looks like a baby.

4358
02:47:13,740 --> 02:47:14,740
We're wrapping up tonight's show.

4359
02:47:14,740 --> 02:47:15,740
Do we have any last minute stories?

4360
02:47:15,740 --> 02:47:18,740
Any last minute video game news stories you wanted to talk about?

4361
02:47:18,740 --> 02:47:19,740
Not really.

4362
02:47:19,740 --> 02:47:20,740
Dan?

4363
02:47:20,740 --> 02:47:21,740
I like video games.

4364
02:47:21,740 --> 02:47:22,740
I know.

4365
02:47:22,740 --> 02:47:24,740
But, you know, are we doing an after birth raw?

4366
02:47:24,740 --> 02:47:26,740
Because we really don't do cage match or anything.

4367
02:47:26,740 --> 02:47:27,740
We'll do a quick after birth.

4368
02:47:27,740 --> 02:47:28,740
Okay.

4369
02:47:28,740 --> 02:47:29,740
All right.

4370
02:47:29,740 --> 02:47:30,740
It'll be more of a still birth.

4371
02:47:30,740 --> 02:47:31,740
All right.

4372
02:47:31,740 --> 02:47:32,740
I will take four chat room FUs.

4373
02:47:32,740 --> 02:47:33,740
All right.

4374
02:47:33,740 --> 02:47:34,740
How's that?

4375
02:47:34,740 --> 02:47:35,740
Fus.

4376
02:47:35,740 --> 02:47:36,740
But we got to wrap up the actual podcast part of the show.

4377
02:47:36,740 --> 02:47:37,740
That's it.

4378
02:47:37,740 --> 02:47:38,740
We're done.

4379
02:47:38,740 --> 02:47:39,740
We're out of here.

4380
02:47:39,740 --> 02:47:40,740
Good night.

4381
02:47:40,740 --> 02:47:42,740
I have to go around the room, though, and say before I got to say goodbye to our guests.

4382
02:47:42,740 --> 02:47:44,740
Misty, thank you so much for being here.

4383
02:47:44,740 --> 02:47:45,740
We hope it was fun.

4384
02:47:45,740 --> 02:47:48,740
You picked a hell of a show to attend, I got to say.

4385
02:47:48,740 --> 02:47:51,740
Any episode would have been more epic with me visiting.

4386
02:47:51,740 --> 02:47:53,740
And she's so humble.

4387
02:47:53,740 --> 02:47:54,740
Exactly.

4388
02:47:54,740 --> 02:47:55,740
All right.

4389
02:47:55,740 --> 02:47:58,740
Well, you have a safe trip back, and we'll come back again soon.

4390
02:47:58,740 --> 02:47:59,740
See us real soon.

4391
02:47:59,740 --> 02:48:00,740
All right.

4392
02:48:00,740 --> 02:48:02,740
We're canceling the show because you're not here next week.

4393
02:48:02,740 --> 02:48:03,740
Just so you know.

4394
02:48:03,740 --> 02:48:04,740
Oh, that's the reason.

4395
02:48:04,740 --> 02:48:07,740
So all the listeners that are upset there's no show next week, you need to blame Misty.

4396
02:48:07,740 --> 02:48:09,740
Hey, you told me how to start a show, so it's happening.

4397
02:48:09,740 --> 02:48:11,740
Dan, the man.

4398
02:48:11,740 --> 02:48:14,740
Oh, actually, I got to say, before we go to Dan, Misty, do you have any final thoughts

4399
02:48:14,740 --> 02:48:15,740
for our listeners tonight?

4400
02:48:15,740 --> 02:48:19,740
If I had to pick a theme song for this week, it would probably be the Nickelback song,

4401
02:48:19,740 --> 02:48:20,740
Burn It to the Ground.

4402
02:48:20,740 --> 02:48:23,740
Nickelback is not allowed to be associated with this program.

4403
02:48:23,740 --> 02:48:24,740
That's what I tried to tell her.

4404
02:48:24,740 --> 02:48:25,740
Shut the hell up.

4405
02:48:25,740 --> 02:48:26,740
All right.

4406
02:48:26,740 --> 02:48:27,740
You should hope.

4407
02:48:27,740 --> 02:48:28,740
How many times am I going to tell you that?

4408
02:48:28,740 --> 02:48:29,740
Dan.

4409
02:48:29,740 --> 02:48:31,740
Oh, I'll do Mystique.

4410
02:48:31,740 --> 02:48:32,740
All right.

4411
02:48:32,740 --> 02:48:37,740
Mystique, thank you for, I don't know really what you did here tonight, but thank you for

4412
02:48:37,740 --> 02:48:38,740
the tacos, actually.

4413
02:48:38,740 --> 02:48:39,740
They were amazing.

4414
02:48:39,740 --> 02:48:41,740
I told you I was going to give you some of my meat.

4415
02:48:41,740 --> 02:48:42,740
All right.

4416
02:48:42,740 --> 02:48:43,740
It was delicious.

4417
02:48:43,740 --> 02:48:45,740
Mystique, do you have anything you want to say to listeners?

4418
02:48:45,740 --> 02:48:47,740
Any final thoughts?

4419
02:48:47,740 --> 02:48:50,740
If you want to marry me, you better fork over something valuable.

4420
02:48:50,740 --> 02:48:52,740
There you go.

4421
02:48:52,740 --> 02:48:54,740
I got a dollar.

4422
02:48:54,740 --> 02:48:55,740
All right.

4423
02:48:55,740 --> 02:48:59,740
Dan, sir, thank you so much for being on the show tonight.

4424
02:48:59,740 --> 02:49:02,740
Orange Lounge Radio, starring Dan.

4425
02:49:02,740 --> 02:49:07,740
Despite all the bashing and fun making fun of you, you've been hilarious tonight.

4426
02:49:07,740 --> 02:49:09,740
You've been making fun of me.

4427
02:49:09,740 --> 02:49:10,740
I mean-

4428
02:49:10,740 --> 02:49:11,740
Sounds like you're opposing me, Rob.

4429
02:49:11,740 --> 02:49:12,740
No, I'm not opposing you.

4430
02:49:12,740 --> 02:49:14,740
I already told you what happened to people who oppose me.

4431
02:49:14,740 --> 02:49:16,740
But you've actually been hilarious, and I know the listeners love you.

4432
02:49:16,740 --> 02:49:18,740
So thank you very much for being here tonight.

4433
02:49:18,740 --> 02:49:19,740
That's what I do.

4434
02:49:19,740 --> 02:49:20,740
We'll maybe see you again in a couple weeks.

4435
02:49:20,740 --> 02:49:21,740
Apparently I'll be back in two weeks.

4436
02:49:21,740 --> 02:49:22,740
Apparently.

4437
02:49:22,740 --> 02:49:23,740
It depends on Matt.

4438
02:49:23,740 --> 02:49:24,740
I don't know what's going to happen.

4439
02:49:24,740 --> 02:49:25,740
So we'll see.

4440
02:49:25,740 --> 02:49:26,740
But even if-

4441
02:49:26,740 --> 02:49:27,740
As long as there's no Matt and I have nothing better to do-

4442
02:49:27,740 --> 02:49:28,740
Even if Matt is here-

4443
02:49:28,740 --> 02:49:29,740
I'll be back.

4444
02:49:29,740 --> 02:49:32,740
Even if Matt is here, I'm sure we would all love it if you'd at least drop in.

4445
02:49:32,740 --> 02:49:33,740
Kind of do the Mystique thing.

4446
02:49:33,740 --> 02:49:34,740
Run in the room, say something, and run away.

4447
02:49:34,740 --> 02:49:36,740
I just like sitting at my own desk.

4448
02:49:36,740 --> 02:49:37,740
All right.

4449
02:49:37,740 --> 02:49:38,740
It's good, isn't it?

4450
02:49:38,740 --> 02:49:40,740
Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight, Dan?

4451
02:49:40,740 --> 02:49:41,740
No, not really.

4452
02:49:41,740 --> 02:49:42,740
Okay.

4453
02:49:42,740 --> 02:49:43,740
People from Sweden sound funny.

4454
02:49:43,740 --> 02:49:46,740
All right.

4455
02:49:46,740 --> 02:49:47,740
And it's like, really?

4456
02:49:47,740 --> 02:49:48,740
Old news.

4457
02:49:48,740 --> 02:49:49,740
That was awesome.

4458
02:49:49,740 --> 02:49:50,740
Totally old news.

4459
02:49:50,740 --> 02:49:51,740
All right.

4460
02:49:51,740 --> 02:49:52,740
I'll save Dark Sakura for last, because she likes to have the final, final word.

4461
02:49:52,740 --> 02:49:57,740
My final thought is, I don't know what my final thought is.

4462
02:49:57,740 --> 02:50:01,740
I just, I'm in a better mood now than I was when I got here.

4463
02:50:01,740 --> 02:50:03,740
You have a hot dog twitched your boobs.

4464
02:50:03,740 --> 02:50:04,740
I do.

4465
02:50:04,740 --> 02:50:06,740
I have a hot dog shirt on.

4466
02:50:06,740 --> 02:50:07,740
And that's it.

4467
02:50:07,740 --> 02:50:08,740
Dark Sakura.

4468
02:50:08,740 --> 02:50:09,740
I won!

4469
02:50:09,740 --> 02:50:10,740
Thank you.

4470
02:50:10,740 --> 02:50:15,740
Thank you guys so much for checking out Orange Lounge Radio.

4471
02:50:15,740 --> 02:50:18,740

4477
02:50:30,740 --> 02:50:31,740
Just help us spread the word.

4478
02:50:31,740 --> 02:50:32,740
We really appreciate it.

4479
02:50:32,740 --> 02:50:34,740
Have a wonderful two weeks.

4480
02:50:34,740 --> 02:50:38,740
We'll see you back in two weeks with an all new, unless, I don't know, maybe a pre-tape

4481
02:50:38,740 --> 02:50:39,740
will happen, but I want to get your hopes up.

4482
02:50:39,740 --> 02:50:40,740
So we'll see you...

4483
02:50:40,740 --> 02:50:41,740
Rob, unnecessary prefix.

4484
02:50:41,740 --> 02:50:42,740
You know what?

4485
02:50:42,740 --> 02:50:43,740
We'll...

4486
02:50:43,740 --> 02:50:45,740
Shut the hell up.

4487
02:50:45,740 --> 02:50:46,740
You know what?

4488
02:50:46,740 --> 02:50:47,740
This is my house.

4489
02:50:47,740 --> 02:50:48,740
Damn!

4490
02:50:48,740 --> 02:50:50,740
If you don't like it, you get the fuck out.

4491
02:50:50,740 --> 02:50:53,740
And on that note, we'll see you whenever we see you.

4492
02:50:53,740 --> 02:50:54,740
Good night.

4493
02:50:54,740 --> 02:50:57,740
