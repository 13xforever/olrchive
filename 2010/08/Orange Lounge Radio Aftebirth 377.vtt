WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:24.440
Okay, guys, quick- shut up!

00:24.440 --> 00:26.240
I didn't intend for that to happen, I swear.

00:26.240 --> 00:27.240
Alright.

00:27.240 --> 00:28.240
That was- I got bullshit!

00:28.240 --> 00:29.240
Shut up.

00:29.240 --> 00:30.240
That was too good.

00:30.240 --> 00:34.200
Alright, we gotta save part B, and in order to do that I have to stop the recording for

00:34.200 --> 00:37.920
a minute and play some music, so we'll be right back in two minutes with the afterbirth,

00:37.920 --> 00:39.920
and yes, right, Dan, there's even more show to go.

00:39.920 --> 00:40.920
Sweet.

00:40.920 --> 00:41.920
Alright, we'll be right back, guys.

00:41.920 --> 00:42.920
It's the sticky part.

00:42.920 --> 00:43.920
Ew.

00:43.920 --> 00:49.920
My thoughts exactly- we'll be right back!

00:49.920 --> 01:09.640
Okay.

02:39.640 --> 03:03.600
Hi, we're back with the Orange Laundry afterbirth.

03:03.600 --> 03:07.360
It's the part of the show that's too hot to podcast, and I really apologize that we don't

03:07.360 --> 03:09.160
have a webcam anymore.

03:09.160 --> 03:11.720
You guys missed it during the break there.

03:11.720 --> 03:17.880
Dan was doing the lasso, Mystique was trying to white people dance.

03:17.880 --> 03:21.120
I was white people dancing.

03:21.120 --> 03:22.120
And it was pretty scary.

03:22.120 --> 03:23.120
You were trying to...

03:23.120 --> 03:24.120
I did the sprinkler.

03:24.120 --> 03:25.120
It was fun.

03:25.120 --> 03:28.160
You were trying to glow stick rave without glow sticks with the lights on.

03:28.160 --> 03:29.720
That was a very ravy song.

03:29.720 --> 03:30.720
It was fun.

03:30.720 --> 03:31.720
I should have...

03:31.720 --> 03:32.720
And meanwhile, I'm over here sitting...

03:32.720 --> 03:33.720
I don't know these people.

03:33.720 --> 03:34.720
I don't know these people.

03:34.720 --> 03:35.720
I don't know these people.

03:35.720 --> 03:36.720
Send me some confused!

03:36.720 --> 03:37.720
You were kind of wagging your finger a little bit.

03:37.720 --> 03:38.720
That was...

03:38.720 --> 03:39.720
I was trying to get more viruses off the computer.

03:39.720 --> 03:40.720
Dan, where's my treble?

03:40.720 --> 03:41.720
He's in the closet with Rob.

03:41.720 --> 03:42.720
Rob is not in the closet.

03:42.720 --> 03:43.720
True that.

03:43.720 --> 03:44.720
All right.

03:44.720 --> 03:59.920
Usually, we would do the cage match right about now, but we don't have a cage match

03:59.920 --> 04:01.920
right now because Loki ain't here, so...

04:01.920 --> 04:03.620
They wouldn't let me pick a song.

04:03.620 --> 04:04.620
But we will...

04:04.620 --> 04:05.620
No, we will.

04:05.620 --> 04:06.620
And they banned my idea of a song.

04:06.620 --> 04:09.120
I would have been afraid of what Dan would pick for a song.

04:09.120 --> 04:10.720
But we will do some FUs.

04:10.720 --> 04:12.120
Do we get sufficient chat remains?

04:12.120 --> 04:13.120
Six.

04:13.120 --> 04:14.120
I thought you said four.

04:14.120 --> 04:15.120
Well, I've been nice.

04:15.120 --> 04:17.620
I like even numbers, Rob.

04:17.620 --> 04:18.620
You're never nice.

04:18.620 --> 04:19.620
Play your music!

04:19.620 --> 04:20.620
She's trying to confuse people.

04:20.620 --> 04:31.620
The first one is Heihachi Tsundoshi, who's also...

04:31.620 --> 04:37.620
Mike's out, FU to the mic.

04:37.620 --> 04:45.220
Heihachi Tsundoshi, who's also Alpha Kinanagram, FU to Hatsune Miku, Project Diva, second

04:45.220 --> 04:51.000
for not including the song Faraway by, is it Kizz or KZ, my favorite song from Diva

04:51.000 --> 04:55.520
One, yet including the level stage elements in edit mode.

04:55.520 --> 04:56.520
Maybe it's a special unlock.

04:56.520 --> 04:58.920
Dan, have you ever played Project Diva?

04:58.920 --> 05:01.320
I have no idea what you're talking about.

05:01.320 --> 05:02.320
Miku.

05:02.320 --> 05:04.720
I can't have the game I would play if I still had a PSP.

05:04.720 --> 05:06.720
That makes me want to kill you.

05:06.720 --> 05:11.360
Ranma, FU to my friend's husband.

05:11.360 --> 05:17.520
Be thankful I didn't slap you out at Otacon last weekend, you ungrateful piece of trash.

05:17.520 --> 05:19.000
Yeah, fuck that guy!

05:19.000 --> 05:22.480
You should get on the knees and worship that woman because she does a lot more than you

05:22.480 --> 05:23.480
think.

05:23.480 --> 05:27.520
And also stop blowing your paycheck on frivolous shit and take care of your kids.

05:27.520 --> 05:30.480
Dude, seriously.

05:30.480 --> 05:38.360
GJBlazeKid, FU to Westroads Mall Arcade for fixing everything else but in the groove.

05:38.360 --> 05:39.360
Toygak.

05:39.360 --> 05:40.360
Can't fix a broken game.

05:40.360 --> 05:41.360
I'm terrible.

05:41.360 --> 05:45.520
FU to my computer for being the slowest piece of crap ever.

05:45.520 --> 05:49.520
I will smash you to the ground if you don't shape up Toygak's computer.

05:49.520 --> 05:50.840
Thanks for scaring my computer.

05:50.840 --> 05:53.840
Yeah, fuck that computer!

05:53.840 --> 06:00.600
FU to you, you demanding wench, you heart.

06:00.600 --> 06:03.360
Yeah, fuck that wench.

06:03.360 --> 06:10.240
You know what, Patty, that was amazingly hot.

06:10.240 --> 06:12.240
I can't stop thinking about you now.

06:12.240 --> 06:16.080
I have no idea what happened.

06:16.080 --> 06:19.160
Last one, MA says to my FU for getting jury duty.

06:19.160 --> 06:23.600
At least I was able to request a postponement because of school is coming up.

06:23.600 --> 06:25.600
Dan just got a look on his face like, oh fuck.

06:25.600 --> 06:27.600
I think I had jury duty this week.

06:27.600 --> 06:28.600
Fuck jury duty!

06:28.600 --> 06:29.600
Fuck it right in the ear!

06:29.600 --> 06:30.600
You do have jury duty?

06:30.600 --> 06:31.600
Fuck it with something hard and sandpaper.

06:31.600 --> 06:32.600
You do have jury duty?

06:32.600 --> 06:33.600
I don't know.

06:33.600 --> 06:34.600
You might want to find out.

06:34.600 --> 06:35.600
You kind of like have to go.

06:35.600 --> 06:36.600
Well I don't know.

06:36.600 --> 06:37.600
Or you call them and tell them you have severe diarrhea and you can't do it.

06:37.600 --> 06:38.600
I have to call in.

06:38.600 --> 06:39.600
Tell them you have, tell them that you've died of dysentery.

06:39.600 --> 06:52.600
Tell them you were in the fucking hospital last week.

06:52.600 --> 06:53.600
Oh my god.

06:53.600 --> 06:54.600
I can't believe we could have probably do it.

06:54.600 --> 06:55.600
Oh it wasn't last week.

06:55.600 --> 06:56.600
I think it's this week.

06:56.600 --> 06:57.600
Like starting tomorrow.

06:57.600 --> 06:58.600
Shit.

06:58.600 --> 06:59.600
So you better call in.

06:59.600 --> 07:00.600
Thanks for fucking with my wife.

07:00.600 --> 07:01.600
Look at this.

07:01.600 --> 07:02.600
Who's telling me what I already knew.

07:02.600 --> 07:03.600
Fuck her!

07:03.600 --> 07:08.600
I thought that was kind of the point.

07:08.600 --> 07:12.600
That's what got you in trouble.

07:12.600 --> 07:17.600
I like mustard on my French fries.

07:17.600 --> 07:21.600
What the hell is happening to this person?

07:21.600 --> 07:26.400
You know what the show needs more of?

07:26.400 --> 07:27.400
Structure?

07:27.400 --> 07:33.800
I swear to god if she put on that Vuvuzela thing I was gonna throw her phone in the toilet.

07:33.800 --> 07:34.800
Me too.

07:34.800 --> 07:35.800
What?

07:35.800 --> 07:36.800
Nothing.

07:36.800 --> 07:37.800
Why did I forget my favorite?

07:37.800 --> 07:38.800
What are you talking about, the Vuvuzela?

07:38.800 --> 07:39.800
I have no idea what you're talking about.

07:39.800 --> 07:40.800
Don't do it.

07:40.800 --> 07:41.800
I'll unplug your mic.

07:41.800 --> 07:42.800
She's doing it.

07:42.800 --> 07:43.800
What did you grab me for?

07:43.800 --> 07:44.800
She wanted me.

07:44.800 --> 07:55.200
Do you have any idea what's happening here?

07:55.200 --> 07:58.880
For your information, Dan, four square, bitch.

07:58.880 --> 07:59.880
Vuvuzela?

07:59.880 --> 08:02.560
I forgot to check in because I want to become the mayor of the house.

08:02.560 --> 08:03.960
You're never gonna be the mayor of the house, Rob.

08:03.960 --> 08:04.960
I check in every day.

08:04.960 --> 08:05.960
Yes, I'm the mayor of Walgreens.

08:05.960 --> 08:11.520
We went right by the Walgreens near my house and I said, I should check in here.

08:11.520 --> 08:12.840
Rob is the mayor.

08:12.840 --> 08:19.000
Rob lives nowhere near the damn Walgreens by the house, yet Rob is the mayor of Walgreens.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
Don't feel bad.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
I'm the mayor.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
How does this happen?

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
Don't feel bad.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
I'm the mayor of the Walgreens across from my work.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
And naturally my work.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.560
I'm the mayor of a Chinese restaurant over by my house.

08:27.560 --> 08:29.920
Aren't you the mayor of Kaushwitz?

08:29.920 --> 08:33.000
I got dethroned as the mayor of Kaushwitz, which pissed me off.

08:33.000 --> 08:37.100
Actually no, Melody was the mayor of Kaushwitz and I was the mayor of near the stinky cows

08:37.100 --> 08:38.100
on I-5.

08:38.100 --> 08:39.100
That's right.

08:39.100 --> 08:41.100
That's right.

08:41.100 --> 08:42.100
And let's see, what else am I the mayor of?

08:42.100 --> 08:44.960
I'm the mayor of one other place and I can't remember what it is.

08:44.960 --> 08:45.960
Walgreens.

08:45.960 --> 08:46.960
No, it's not Walgreens.

08:46.960 --> 08:48.680
I'm the mayor of Walgreens, the Chinese restaurant and one other place.

08:48.680 --> 08:49.680
I can't remember.

08:49.680 --> 08:50.680
Another Walgreens.

08:50.680 --> 08:51.680
I was the...

08:51.680 --> 08:52.680
Hold on.

08:52.680 --> 08:53.680
Rob, you should create a...

08:53.680 --> 08:54.680
I'm not the mayor of Taco Bell.

08:54.680 --> 08:57.500
You should create a place that calls the chair in Jamie's house.

08:57.500 --> 08:59.400
The chair at Jamie's house.

08:59.400 --> 09:01.400
I will let you be the mayor of the chair.

09:01.400 --> 09:03.520
Practically in the closet at Jamie's house.

09:03.520 --> 09:08.260
In the closet at Jamie's house.

09:08.260 --> 09:09.260
That's right.

09:09.260 --> 09:10.260
The fabulous OLR Studios.

09:10.260 --> 09:13.680
My grandma in our chat room says Rob is the fabulous mayor of Walgreens.

09:13.680 --> 09:14.680
Fabulous.

09:14.680 --> 09:18.520
Am I really that gay, you guys?

09:18.520 --> 09:19.720
Come on.

09:19.720 --> 09:22.560
You are wearing a shirt with a hot dog on it.

09:22.560 --> 09:23.560
No, no, no.

09:23.560 --> 09:25.680
It's not just a shirt with a hot dog on it.

09:25.680 --> 09:26.920
It has a rainbow too.

09:26.920 --> 09:27.920
It does.

09:27.920 --> 09:28.920
It does.

09:28.920 --> 09:32.280
You should take a picture of my shirt, but I just don't want my fat old gut to be out

09:32.280 --> 09:33.280
there.

09:33.280 --> 09:34.280
It just needs glitter to make it complete.

09:34.280 --> 09:35.280
Hold on.

09:35.280 --> 09:36.280
I'm trying to see where I'm the mayor.

09:36.280 --> 09:37.280
I'm the mayor of three places.

09:37.280 --> 09:38.280
Jack in the box.

09:38.280 --> 09:39.280
Jack in the box.

09:39.280 --> 09:40.280
Jack in the box.

09:40.280 --> 09:41.280
Jack in the box.

09:41.280 --> 09:42.280
Yes.

09:42.280 --> 09:45.020
A week ago, Jack in the Box sent out the most amazing coupon sheet.

09:45.020 --> 09:48.980
It had all sorts of cool freebies on it.

09:48.980 --> 09:50.920
Rob totally made the peewee Herman face.

09:50.920 --> 09:51.920
Okay.

09:51.920 --> 09:52.920
Um, let's see.

09:52.920 --> 09:53.920
Oh, I'm checking in.

09:53.920 --> 09:54.920
Hold on.

09:54.920 --> 09:55.920
Places.

09:55.920 --> 09:58.360
And I gotta be careful how I do this.

09:58.360 --> 09:59.440
I don't want to tell the listeners where you live.

09:59.440 --> 10:00.640
This is so too hot for the podcast.

10:00.640 --> 10:01.640
Exactly.

10:01.640 --> 10:02.640
I know, right?

10:02.640 --> 10:03.640
This is amazing radio right now.

10:03.640 --> 10:04.640
Okay.

10:04.640 --> 10:05.640
Oops.

10:05.640 --> 10:06.640
As Rob plays with this iPhone.

10:06.640 --> 10:07.640
Live!

10:07.640 --> 10:08.640
On the air.

10:08.640 --> 10:11.080
Amy is the mayor, let's see, check in here.

10:11.080 --> 10:12.080
Fuck yes, I'm the mayor.

10:12.080 --> 10:13.080
You're the mayor of where?

10:13.080 --> 10:14.080
This house.

10:14.080 --> 10:15.080
Really?

10:15.080 --> 10:16.080
Yes.

10:16.080 --> 10:18.460
That's just pathetic.

10:18.460 --> 10:19.960
At least on Foursquare.

10:19.960 --> 10:26.320
I just had to check to make sure my zipper was up when she took the...

10:26.320 --> 10:29.880
All Games Radio is switching between its live and on-demand feed.

10:29.880 --> 10:31.600
This may take several moments.

10:31.600 --> 11:00.640
All Games Radio is switching between its live and on-demand feed.

11:00.640 --> 11:01.640
Tap dancing.

11:01.640 --> 11:02.640
What happened?

11:02.640 --> 11:03.640
I don't...

11:03.640 --> 11:04.640
Be back.

11:04.640 --> 11:05.640
All right.

11:05.640 --> 11:06.640
Yeah, you've got hot dogs.

11:06.640 --> 11:20.640
I have a pink roller skate on my shirt.

11:20.640 --> 11:34.680
You do, we're free tonight.

11:34.680 --> 11:35.680
I don't know how that happened.

11:35.680 --> 11:37.680
I don't know how this stream came out.

11:37.680 --> 11:38.680
Holly, you're tomorrow.

11:38.680 --> 11:39.680
I didn't murder this stream.

11:39.680 --> 11:44.680
Would you still remember me?

11:44.680 --> 11:46.480
You know what we need to do?

11:46.480 --> 11:49.400
You know what we need to do that we haven't done in forever and we'll do it tonight because

11:49.400 --> 11:51.960
we don't have a cage match and we ended a little bit early tonight.

11:51.960 --> 11:54.480
We're going to do Ask Orange Lounge.

11:54.480 --> 11:55.480
Ooh!

11:55.480 --> 11:56.480
Everyone.

11:56.480 --> 11:57.480
Everyone.

11:57.480 --> 11:58.480
Ooh.

11:58.480 --> 11:59.480
Pretty good timing though.

11:59.480 --> 12:00.480
Ah.

12:00.480 --> 12:01.480
It is our master.

12:01.480 --> 12:02.480
Ooh.

12:02.480 --> 12:06.480
It decides who will go and who will stay.

12:06.480 --> 12:10.480
You can ask us anything you want.

12:10.480 --> 12:11.880
Within reason.

12:11.880 --> 12:12.880
Ask Orange Lounge.

12:12.880 --> 12:13.880
Type.

12:13.880 --> 12:14.880
Message to Sky.

12:14.880 --> 12:18.040
You can ask anything unreasonable, but we may not answer it.

12:18.040 --> 12:19.040
That's right.

12:19.040 --> 12:20.040
Ask.

12:20.040 --> 12:21.400
Ask what color Misty's Undies are.

12:21.400 --> 12:22.400
I'm going to do it.

12:22.400 --> 12:23.400
She's wearing a ball.

12:23.400 --> 12:24.400
I'm at Misty's to speak.

12:24.400 --> 12:25.400
Because she'll tell you.

12:25.400 --> 12:26.400
No.

12:26.400 --> 12:27.400
I actually know.

12:27.400 --> 12:28.400
All right.

12:28.400 --> 12:29.400
Oh, really?

12:29.400 --> 12:30.400
She's jacking.

12:30.400 --> 12:31.400
I just slipped over.

12:31.400 --> 12:32.400
Her panties were hanging out.

12:32.400 --> 12:33.400
Hold on.

12:33.400 --> 12:34.400
It was all for you, Rob.

12:34.400 --> 12:35.400
I'm telling you.

12:35.400 --> 12:36.400
Jamie's taking pictures.

12:36.400 --> 12:37.400
What?

12:37.400 --> 12:38.400
I can't even turn around.

12:38.400 --> 12:49.720
Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.

12:49.720 --> 12:54.360
All hell breaks loose.

12:54.360 --> 12:55.360
I'm making shit happen.

12:55.360 --> 12:57.320
I've got girls taking their pants off.

12:57.320 --> 12:58.320
No, fuck it.

12:58.320 --> 12:59.320
It's crazy.

12:59.320 --> 13:00.320
Yeah.

13:00.320 --> 13:01.320
Shit'd be crazy around here.

13:01.320 --> 13:02.320
Dan, do it.

13:02.320 --> 13:03.320
Rob.

13:03.320 --> 13:04.320
It's not good.

13:04.320 --> 13:05.320
It's fine as long as you don't see the cootie on there.

13:05.320 --> 13:06.320
It's Misty.

13:06.320 --> 13:07.320
It's Misty and Misty being on the cootie at the same time.

13:07.320 --> 13:11.200
Do not put that on the Internet.

13:11.200 --> 13:12.640
I would not put that on the Internet.

13:12.640 --> 13:13.640
I'm putting it on the Internet.

13:13.640 --> 13:14.640
I'm putting it on the Internet.

13:14.640 --> 13:15.640
Dude, don't get our flicker taken away.

13:15.640 --> 13:16.640
Look, stars.

13:16.640 --> 13:17.640
It's just under us.

13:17.640 --> 13:18.640
It's not like she's going beaver.

13:18.640 --> 13:19.640
Now I want to watch Roger Rabbit.

13:19.640 --> 13:20.640
Can we do...

13:20.640 --> 13:21.640
Are you ready?

13:21.640 --> 13:22.640
Ask O.L.R.

13:22.640 --> 13:23.640
All right.

13:23.640 --> 13:24.640
Ask O.L.R.

13:24.640 --> 13:25.640
We got...

13:25.640 --> 13:26.640
Look, every little red screen right there is a question.

13:26.640 --> 13:27.640
So we got a lot of questions.

13:27.640 --> 13:28.640
We want to see the picture of Misty's panties.

13:28.640 --> 13:29.640
I'm seriously crying.

13:29.640 --> 13:30.640
All right.

13:30.640 --> 13:40.480
Ronma says, I demand a fucking web camera.

13:40.480 --> 13:41.480
All right.

13:41.480 --> 13:42.480
Can we go?

13:42.480 --> 13:43.480
Can we go?

13:43.480 --> 13:44.480
Yeah.

13:44.480 --> 13:45.480
Top shit, Ronma.

13:45.480 --> 13:46.480
All right.

13:46.480 --> 13:47.480
Here we go.

13:47.480 --> 13:48.480
Sing a song.

13:48.480 --> 13:49.480
Can you help me out, Dan?

13:49.480 --> 13:50.480
All right, guys.

13:50.480 --> 13:51.480
I'm looking at the screen.

13:51.480 --> 13:52.480
Let's ask O.L.R.

13:52.480 --> 13:53.480
Some stupid question.

13:53.480 --> 13:55.480
What will we find out tonight on O.L.R.

13:55.480 --> 13:56.480
Radio?

13:56.480 --> 13:58.760
Will we find out the color of Misty's panties?

13:58.760 --> 13:59.760
Yes.

13:59.760 --> 14:03.040
I deeply wish I had a lyric sheet because I want to sing that song.

14:03.040 --> 14:04.040
I'm done.

14:04.040 --> 14:05.040
O.L.R. radio song.

14:05.040 --> 14:06.040
That's like if we're trying to sing about some chick's panties.

14:06.040 --> 14:07.040
It is very fun.

14:07.040 --> 14:08.040
I had a good time.

14:08.040 --> 14:09.040
Exactly.

14:09.040 --> 14:13.480
Singing the song with you.

14:13.480 --> 14:15.800
The greatest thing is this part isn't recorded.

14:15.800 --> 14:16.800
Oh.

14:16.800 --> 14:17.800
Oh.

14:17.800 --> 14:18.800
I want to listen to this again later.

14:18.800 --> 14:20.120
Actually, I do have a recording running.

14:20.120 --> 14:23.080
I usually just throw this out, but tonight I might save it.

14:23.080 --> 14:25.160
You should save it for the DVD that we're never going to do.

14:25.160 --> 14:26.520
The DVD we're never going to do.

14:26.520 --> 14:27.960
We will do the DVD.

14:27.960 --> 14:29.000
Free with every t-shirt.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
We will do the DVD.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
It's a DVD of a radio show.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.560
If we ever get the damn shirts out.

14:32.560 --> 14:34.560
It's just not what it's like.

14:34.560 --> 14:39.360
Goldanthro asks, what color are Misty's underwear?

14:39.360 --> 14:41.920
They are blue with stars on them.

14:41.920 --> 14:45.080
Stars and moons.

14:45.080 --> 14:48.760
But no pink diamonds or horseshoes.

14:48.760 --> 14:49.760
Or Pikachu's.

14:49.760 --> 14:53.880
DJ Blazkin asks, what was your first Bamani experience?

14:53.880 --> 14:55.640
I'm going to defer this question to Dan.

14:55.640 --> 14:59.120
What was your first Bamani experience?

14:59.120 --> 15:03.000
Uh, I guess it would have been what?

15:03.000 --> 15:04.400
Me bringing that burn over.

15:04.400 --> 15:07.640
No, I mean, it was in the arcade for sure.

15:07.640 --> 15:08.640
No, we had the-

15:08.640 --> 15:10.200
Down in Milpitas.

15:10.200 --> 15:12.200
That's, no, it was at Disneyland.

15:12.200 --> 15:14.320
No, no, it was before that.

15:14.320 --> 15:18.840
We played DDR in 99 when they were first coming out in California.

15:18.840 --> 15:19.840
It was early.

15:19.840 --> 15:22.640
I remember though, pretty early on, I imported the Dreamcast version for Jamie.

15:22.640 --> 15:26.400
And that was probably the only version of DDR that I really bothered to play.

15:26.400 --> 15:29.440
And then Julie bought a second dance pad, which I probably stole from her and never

15:29.440 --> 15:30.440
gave back.

15:30.440 --> 15:31.560
No, he's not kidding.

15:31.560 --> 15:33.760
It's in the box.

15:33.760 --> 15:36.920
We still have it in the box.

15:36.920 --> 15:37.920
So yeah.

15:37.920 --> 15:40.680
And if you ask her about it, she'll probably say, oh, I should get that back from you.

15:40.680 --> 15:48.560
My first Bamani experience where I really enjoyed it was Guitar Freaks at Milpitas.

15:48.560 --> 15:51.520
Which George got me to play because George was like, no, no, no, it's cool.

15:51.520 --> 15:52.520
You'll like this.

15:52.520 --> 15:54.000
And I was like, fuck that game.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.120
I'm going to play Street Fighter.

15:56.120 --> 15:58.800
And he was like, no, man, you got to try Guitar Freaks.

15:58.800 --> 16:00.240
And I played Guitar Freaks.

16:00.240 --> 16:04.960
And Guitar Freaks at first was the greatest Bamani game because you could suck at it,

16:04.960 --> 16:06.760
but it didn't hack you too hard.

16:06.760 --> 16:07.760
Like you could barely pass.

16:07.760 --> 16:09.620
And it was like, that was the best song ever.

16:09.620 --> 16:10.620
You kick ass.

16:10.620 --> 16:11.620
And I'm like, I love this game.

16:11.620 --> 16:13.520
It makes me feel good about myself.

16:13.520 --> 16:17.080
Then like the third or fourth mix came out and it got blisteringly hard.

16:17.080 --> 16:19.080
And I was like, all right, I can play Welcome to the Jungle.

16:19.080 --> 16:21.080
And it's like, fuck you, you lose.

16:21.080 --> 16:26.160
And I'm like, I paid for this.

16:26.160 --> 16:27.520
That's what you pay Bamani games to do.

16:27.520 --> 16:28.520
Make fun of you.

16:28.520 --> 16:29.520
I hate that.

16:29.520 --> 16:30.520
All right.

16:30.520 --> 16:33.920
Rama asks, Sky, how fabulous are you?

16:33.920 --> 16:34.920
Why?

16:34.920 --> 16:37.920
I will, I will defer to the, to the others in studio.

16:37.920 --> 16:39.080
How fabulous am I?

16:39.080 --> 16:43.680
To quote Ulala in a paraphrase, you are fab-u-less.

16:43.680 --> 16:45.560
Hot dog.

16:45.560 --> 16:46.560
Misty?

16:46.560 --> 16:47.560
Boom shakalaka.

16:47.560 --> 16:53.320
I'm not quite sure, brilliant comes to mind though.

16:53.320 --> 16:54.320
Jaguar!

16:54.320 --> 16:55.320
Jaguar!

16:55.320 --> 16:56.320
Jaguar!

16:56.320 --> 17:05.080
SSJ wonder mat asks, how did Dan propose to Jamie?

17:05.080 --> 17:08.080
Did you propose?

17:08.080 --> 17:09.080
Even I know this story.

17:09.080 --> 17:11.080
If you guys, if I know this story and you two don't.

17:11.080 --> 17:13.280
We just more like decided that we were going to do it.

17:13.280 --> 17:15.280
I think it had something to do with pro wrestling.

17:15.280 --> 17:16.680
No, no, no, no, no.

17:16.680 --> 17:19.080
We were watching, we were watching UHF.

17:19.080 --> 17:20.240
Was it UHF?

17:20.240 --> 17:21.240
On Valentine's day.

17:21.240 --> 17:23.520
We were watching something and there was a lot of sex involved.

17:23.520 --> 17:25.680
And Jamie got to drink from the fire hose.

17:25.680 --> 17:28.680
Just so you know.

17:28.680 --> 17:29.680
Yuck.

17:29.680 --> 17:35.240
No, but we were drinking, we were, no, this is how you knew that one day your wife would

17:35.240 --> 17:36.240
be Jewish.

17:36.240 --> 17:37.240
Cause we were drinking Manischewitz.

17:37.240 --> 17:40.960
I fucking didn't know you were going to be Jewish.

17:40.960 --> 17:45.720
I still barely, I still barely, I still don't even want to realize that.

17:45.720 --> 17:46.720
Mazel tov!

17:46.720 --> 17:47.720
Mazel tov!

17:47.720 --> 17:51.520
I'm going to get seven days of presents.

17:51.520 --> 17:52.520
All right.

17:52.520 --> 17:53.520
Yeah.

17:53.520 --> 17:54.520
Pencils and erasers.

17:54.520 --> 17:56.520
I love pencils and erasers.

17:56.520 --> 17:58.520
Dan is a real humanitarian.

17:58.520 --> 18:00.040
He tries to see the good in everything.

18:00.040 --> 18:01.040
Yes.

18:01.040 --> 18:02.040
My wife's going to be Jewish.

18:02.040 --> 18:03.040
Eight days of presents!

18:03.040 --> 18:04.040
Eight days of presents!

18:04.040 --> 18:05.040
Yay!

18:05.040 --> 18:06.040
Two Christmases!

18:06.040 --> 18:15.040
I just, I just, just now see the irony in the present.

18:15.040 --> 18:20.040
The proposed, the, the sort of co-decision to get married over Manischewitz.

18:20.040 --> 18:21.040
All right.

18:21.040 --> 18:25.040
Also, S2100Matt asks, when are you all coming to New York City?

18:25.040 --> 18:26.640
New York City?

18:26.640 --> 18:29.720
To get a rope.

18:29.720 --> 18:31.320
When I ain't a broke ass.

18:31.320 --> 18:32.720
When Sister Act is on Broadway.

18:32.720 --> 18:33.720
Yeah.

18:33.720 --> 18:37.520
I need to accumulate some money before I can come crush.

18:37.520 --> 18:39.360
When someone invites me for free.

18:39.360 --> 18:41.800
I've never been to New York.

18:41.800 --> 18:42.800
I have.

18:42.800 --> 18:43.800
It's fun.

18:43.800 --> 18:44.800
It's, it's pretty fantastic.

18:44.800 --> 18:45.800
I love New York.

18:45.800 --> 18:46.800
Especially when I'm over that flank.

18:46.800 --> 18:49.840
This is how long ago, this is how long ago was it?

18:49.840 --> 18:50.840
I went to New York.

18:50.840 --> 18:56.020
Um, there were still these really two large buildings and one of them had a hole in it.

18:56.020 --> 18:59.520
There are so many ways to die in New York City.

18:59.520 --> 19:00.520
Thank you, Dennis Leary.

19:00.520 --> 19:01.520
All right.

19:01.520 --> 19:03.520
But, Rob, does that date when I went?

19:03.520 --> 19:05.520
Start spreading the news.

19:05.520 --> 19:08.220
Well, I've already been to Chicago, so.

19:08.220 --> 19:10.320
I love New York.

19:10.320 --> 19:12.940
I have the best nights out in New York City.

19:12.940 --> 19:13.940
You know why?

19:13.940 --> 19:14.940
Because it's never end.

19:14.940 --> 19:17.520
I want to go to New York with Rob.

19:17.520 --> 19:18.720
We will have the best time.

19:18.720 --> 19:19.720
We're going to go to Broadway.

19:19.720 --> 19:20.720
Broadway.

19:20.720 --> 19:21.720
Next question.

19:21.720 --> 19:25.120
We're going to go see Mama Beyond Broadway, can't we?

19:25.120 --> 19:26.120
Yeah.

19:26.120 --> 19:28.720
We can make OLRG finally happen and it can happen in New York.

19:28.720 --> 19:32.280
Giove Dea is asking quite a few questions here.

19:32.280 --> 19:33.600
Some of them have already been asked.

19:33.600 --> 19:34.880
Uh, we'll start here.

19:34.880 --> 19:38.040
If you had Lady Tata's, what would their names be?

19:38.040 --> 19:39.040
Ooh, Dan.

19:39.040 --> 19:43.480
Hey, maybe, maybe that could be Lady Gaga's sidekick, Lady Tata.

19:43.480 --> 19:46.840
Instead of Chibi Moon, it's-

19:46.840 --> 19:49.280
Dr. Evil and Professor Chaos.

19:49.280 --> 19:54.720
I think mine would have, well, on that note, then I would have to name one Alejandro and

19:54.720 --> 19:56.760
the other one, I don't know.

19:56.760 --> 19:57.760
Enrique.

19:57.760 --> 19:58.760
Polka Face.

19:58.760 --> 19:59.760
Ricky Martin.

19:59.760 --> 20:00.760
Ricky Martin.

20:00.760 --> 20:02.760
Yeah, Ricky Martin and Alejandro.

20:02.760 --> 20:03.760
All right.

20:03.760 --> 20:07.640
And Giove Dea wants to know, Rob, will you be my gay boyfriend?

20:07.640 --> 20:11.600
Have you, have we ever played that song on the show before?

20:11.600 --> 20:12.600
Do you have a lot of money?

20:12.600 --> 20:18.600
Uh, when it comes to being, uh, uh, the, the hag gay relationship, I am Polly.

20:18.600 --> 20:19.600
So I, yes.

20:19.600 --> 20:20.600
Pollyanna?

20:20.600 --> 20:21.600
And easy.

20:21.600 --> 20:22.600
All right.

20:22.600 --> 20:27.280
Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, your hags love you.

20:27.280 --> 20:29.640
And I love my hags and they're fun bags.

20:29.640 --> 20:30.640
All right.

20:30.640 --> 20:35.560
Dark Tetsuya says, since there probably won't be a show, can we finally run the best of

20:35.560 --> 20:37.060
next week?

20:37.060 --> 20:40.720
If I'm not too lazy to upload it to the all game server?

20:40.720 --> 20:41.720
Sure.

20:41.720 --> 20:45.200
No, I'll just get, just get on me about that midweek and I'll make sure it happens.

20:45.200 --> 20:47.920
Uh, Toa Gak asks, oh, a game question.

20:47.920 --> 20:48.920
What is that?

20:48.920 --> 20:49.920
A video game question?

20:49.920 --> 20:52.920
I thought he was going to ask me what color undies I was wearing.

20:52.920 --> 20:53.920
All right, here we go.

20:53.920 --> 21:01.840
Toa Gak asks, would you rather have a game with an amazing storyline, but last gen graphics

21:01.840 --> 21:05.480
or amazing graphics and a poor storyline?

21:05.480 --> 21:10.720
I would go with, with amazing storyline.

21:10.720 --> 21:14.520
Like cease to mean anything after your first few hours of playing the game.

21:14.520 --> 21:17.680
So the storyline is pretty much fine.

21:17.680 --> 21:19.160
Are you comparing panties?

21:19.160 --> 21:20.840
What is going on over there?

21:20.840 --> 21:24.360
Take off your shirts.

21:24.360 --> 21:29.440
Oh God, she did it.

21:29.440 --> 21:31.320
Shit's getting crazy up in here.

21:31.320 --> 21:36.000
Where's the malt liquor?

21:36.000 --> 21:38.680
That's not my panties I was talking about.

21:38.680 --> 21:41.280
By the way, very nice.

21:41.280 --> 21:42.280
Malte liquor doesn't burn.

21:42.280 --> 21:43.280
All right.

21:43.280 --> 21:49.280
Um, I would say actually I want amazing graphics and poor storyline because you know, the spanking

21:49.280 --> 21:53.040
game has no storyline whatsoever and that sounds better than anything else.

21:53.040 --> 22:00.000
So what's the nice question I'm getting to it.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
I'm getting to it.

22:01.000 --> 22:05.440
Uh, Toa Gak also asked, why are there so many nicknames for boobs, boobs, knockers, tits,

22:05.440 --> 22:07.440
fun bags, et cetera.

22:07.440 --> 22:08.880
Um, jumblies.

22:08.880 --> 22:10.280
Why not?

22:10.280 --> 22:13.680
Well, how come so many-

22:13.680 --> 22:17.040
Because breasts sound so formal.

22:17.040 --> 22:19.800
People do stupid shit like name their car, so why not?

22:19.800 --> 22:26.640
How come there's a song that talks about the many names of a penis?

22:26.640 --> 22:27.640
Monty Python did it.

22:27.640 --> 22:28.640
Halliwhacker.

22:28.640 --> 22:31.680
Isn't it awful nice to have a penis?

22:31.680 --> 22:34.200
Isn't it awfully good to have a dong?

22:34.200 --> 22:36.920
Your piece of pork, your wife's best friend, your pussy or your cock.

22:36.920 --> 22:40.200
You can wrap it up in riddance, you can stick it in your sock.

22:40.200 --> 22:45.280
Amaze Satsuma says, can you give me a job slash occupation for Mad Libs?

22:45.280 --> 22:47.280
Jizz Mopper.

22:47.280 --> 22:51.640
Actually, actually I prefer Kumbucket.

22:51.640 --> 22:55.960
Erotic Engineer.

22:55.960 --> 22:57.920
I like Kumbucket.

22:57.920 --> 23:02.280
Frisbee, dear strong bad, how do you type with boxing gloves on your hands?

23:02.280 --> 23:04.480
Wrong show.

23:04.480 --> 23:10.440
That question was totally crappy.

23:10.440 --> 23:11.440
That's it.

23:11.440 --> 23:12.440
That was all the questions.

23:12.440 --> 23:13.440
I have a question, Rob.

23:13.440 --> 23:14.440
What?

23:14.440 --> 23:15.440
Uh oh.

23:15.440 --> 23:16.440
What the fuck are we on?

23:16.440 --> 23:18.280
I don't know, but that's going to do it for Ask Orange Lounge.

23:18.280 --> 23:19.280
All games radio.

23:19.280 --> 23:22.280
Who said we need to be on anything?

23:22.280 --> 23:24.280
I'm not even on Bikin' It.

23:24.280 --> 23:27.640
That's all the time we have for Ask Orange Lounge.

23:27.640 --> 23:30.800
We hope you learn something tonight on Orange Lounge Radio.

23:30.800 --> 23:35.160
All the women wear blue underwear.

23:35.160 --> 23:36.160
That's all I learned.

23:36.160 --> 23:38.920
And now I'm scarred for the rest of the night.

23:38.920 --> 23:42.480
Good for you.

23:42.480 --> 23:44.480
P.S. Jizz Mopper.

23:44.480 --> 23:48.560
All right, Rama's asking a serious question.

23:48.560 --> 23:49.960
Actually, this is a serious question.

23:49.960 --> 23:50.960
Uh oh.

23:50.960 --> 23:51.960
Downer.

23:51.960 --> 23:52.960
All right, Rama say- Thanks, Rama.

23:52.960 --> 23:53.960
Serious question.

23:53.960 --> 23:54.960
We can't get a serious question.

23:54.960 --> 23:55.960
I don't think I've ever told this on a show.

23:55.960 --> 23:56.960
Are we really going to do this?

23:56.960 --> 23:57.960
Sure, why not?

23:57.960 --> 23:58.960
Do it.

23:58.960 --> 24:00.760
Rama says, when did you come out of the closet and how did your family take it?

24:00.760 --> 24:04.920
Dan, do you want to answer this?

24:04.920 --> 24:06.920
They knew when I was young.

24:06.920 --> 24:12.560
No, in Dan's case, when they finally removed the deadbolt and he came out blinking into

24:12.560 --> 24:15.200
the sunlight for the first time in 13 years.

24:15.200 --> 24:16.880
They were all surprisingly accepting.

24:16.880 --> 24:17.880
Here's the deal.

24:17.880 --> 24:18.880
Here's the deal.

24:18.880 --> 24:22.040
My mom asked me for like three months straight every day, are you gay?

24:22.040 --> 24:23.040
Are you gay?

24:23.040 --> 24:24.040
Are you gay?

24:24.040 --> 24:25.040
And like, it kind of got annoying.

24:25.040 --> 24:26.280
Like I was like, cause this is what it was.

24:26.280 --> 24:30.720
I didn't like the fact, you know, cause I had a tough time in high school cause I

24:30.720 --> 24:34.480
got called fag and all that stuff a lot in high school and I didn't really like it.

24:34.480 --> 24:37.080
And I didn't really know I was gay then cause I was just trying to be normal.

24:37.080 --> 24:39.380
You know, have a girlfriend and you know, this is how we roll.

24:39.380 --> 24:42.560
You know, I'm, I'm a hot stud playing the clarinet in the marching band, right?

24:42.560 --> 24:47.840
So you know, and trying to do that whole thing, I didn't really want to admit I was gay because

24:47.840 --> 24:50.000
I didn't want all those people to be right.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.880
But then when I kind of realized I was gay, like I, that was one of the first things I

24:52.880 --> 24:53.880
had to conquer.

24:53.880 --> 24:56.880
So when my mom joined in on it, I really didn't appreciate it.

24:56.880 --> 25:01.000
Probably one day it actually kind of exploded in a, yes, are you happy?

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
Now leave me alone.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.520
And she ran off to her room to cry for the rest of the day.

25:04.520 --> 25:05.600
But here's why she did it.

25:05.600 --> 25:07.120
I found this out years later.

25:07.120 --> 25:11.800
I had some friends over one night and she actually overheard one of my lady friends

25:11.800 --> 25:16.260
at the time, um, I almost said her name, but I guess I shouldn't, on the phone, uh, talking

25:16.260 --> 25:20.080
to her mom and she overheard her say to her mom, no, don't worry.

25:20.080 --> 25:21.080
They're all gay guys.

25:21.080 --> 25:22.080
It's going to be fine.

25:22.080 --> 25:25.760
So my mom actually found out because of my loud mouth female friend.

25:25.760 --> 25:27.080
So she knew that whole time.

25:27.080 --> 25:29.040
She just wanted me to tell her bitches.

25:29.040 --> 25:30.040
All right.

25:30.040 --> 25:35.520
But then the next day she came out with her eyes all puffy and you know, she's like, I

25:35.520 --> 25:37.680
just want you to know I still love you.

25:37.680 --> 25:40.360
And I've known since you were four.

25:40.360 --> 25:44.120
And I'm like, how do you know when I didn't know until I was like 17, how do you know

25:44.120 --> 25:45.520
when you're four?

25:45.520 --> 25:51.040
Because mothers always, we had a kid in my family, you know, but my, my eldest cousin

25:51.040 --> 25:57.600
who was gay and I never, you know, I never put two and two into it.

25:57.600 --> 26:01.440
It was just, he was who he was, but my folks and people in my family were always like,

26:01.440 --> 26:04.560
we knew from the time he was a young, young boy that he was gay.

26:04.560 --> 26:08.580
I just, I always, there's a part of me that doesn't like that though, because it insinuates

26:08.580 --> 26:10.600
that being gay, you act a certain way.

26:10.600 --> 26:13.280
And I don't think that's true.

26:13.280 --> 26:18.280
As I sit here on my legs crossed tapping on the table, but there's not like you can't,

26:18.280 --> 26:19.280
okay.

26:19.280 --> 26:21.440
You can't act gay if you're straight, you can't act straight if you're gay.

26:21.440 --> 26:26.240
But what is straight acting and gay acting?

26:26.240 --> 26:29.000
There's not, you know, you know what I'm talking about.

26:29.000 --> 26:30.520
You fucking know what I'm talking about.

26:30.520 --> 26:35.960
I do, but I understand I'm not trying to perpetuate the stereotype or anything, but like I looked

26:35.960 --> 26:42.040
at Rob when I first met you and I was like, wow, and you're not wearing like feather boas

26:42.040 --> 26:43.040
and shit.

26:43.040 --> 26:59.200
I didn't come in and go, hi Dan, Dan's gaydar has improved because I wasn't threatening.

26:59.200 --> 27:03.280
I was probably, I probably had my arm around Jamie and we were skipping and Dan was like,

27:03.280 --> 27:09.840
somehow this is not threatening to me.

27:09.840 --> 27:17.600
Dan knows that I have complete and utter devotion to the gays, the truth is, you know, I realize

27:17.600 --> 27:21.480
that any who oppose me can be summarily dealt with.

27:21.480 --> 27:22.960
All right.

27:22.960 --> 27:28.320
Do you know if I told my mom about that I had a girlfriend before?

27:28.320 --> 27:29.320
Really?

27:29.320 --> 27:30.320
You know what she said?

27:30.320 --> 27:31.320
What?

27:31.320 --> 27:32.320
I don't need to hear that.

27:32.320 --> 27:33.320
Yeah, me either.

27:33.320 --> 27:34.320
You do?

27:34.320 --> 27:35.320
All right.

27:35.320 --> 27:37.800
Well, here's the, here's the other thing that's important because my mom said, and this is

27:37.800 --> 27:41.880
very important, important part of the story is my mom said, I called your grandma and

27:41.880 --> 27:44.240
I told her, I'm like, why are you telling everybody?

27:44.240 --> 27:47.280
She's like, no, I want you to know what your grandma said, because it meant a lot.

27:47.280 --> 27:50.080
I told your grandma that you were gay and I'm like, what'd she say?

27:50.080 --> 27:55.120
And my grandma said, so what?

27:55.120 --> 27:57.120
So rest in peace, grandma Shaw.

27:57.120 --> 27:58.120
All right.

27:58.120 --> 28:03.680
Uh, anyhow, um, Dan, I do miss your cousin because I got along really well with your

28:03.680 --> 28:04.680
cousin.

28:04.680 --> 28:13.280
Uh, lastly, God, it's like the all gay OLR DJ Blaiskin asks, what do you think about

28:13.280 --> 28:15.440
prop eight being put in the fire?

28:15.440 --> 28:20.680
Um, obviously, obviously it needed to happen and it's a good thing.

28:20.680 --> 28:24.520
But the thing is, is that, you know, because of the way it happened, that there are people

28:24.520 --> 28:27.240
out there who do still want to fight it.

28:27.240 --> 28:28.240
It's not over.

28:28.240 --> 28:32.320
I just, I would, there's a part of me that really hopes the stay gets lifted, but honestly

28:32.320 --> 28:35.100
this issue just isn't over until the Supreme court decides on it.

28:35.100 --> 28:39.000
And I am a little nervous about the Supreme court decides, are we going to take away next?

28:39.000 --> 28:45.440
I just hope that history and things that happened in, you know, loving V Virginia and some of

28:45.440 --> 28:49.480
these other things that happened in the past will kind of set the presidents for overturning

28:49.480 --> 28:51.580
property at the Supreme court level.

28:51.580 --> 28:56.540
But I worry there's unfortunately that many ignoramus people in the world who for whatever

28:56.540 --> 28:58.440
reason want to have their say in my life.

28:58.440 --> 29:02.280
The moment they bring the 14th amendment into it, you know, it becomes an even bigger issue.

29:02.280 --> 29:07.720
And I kind of think that some of those pro prop eight people might actually have more

29:07.720 --> 29:13.820
to fear if it goes to the, to the Supreme court, because then if, if this, they uphold

29:13.820 --> 29:19.240
the ruling that, yes, this is unconstitutional, that's national precedent.

29:19.240 --> 29:20.240
National precedent.

29:20.240 --> 29:22.380
There's a bunch of scared ass insecure fuckers.

29:22.380 --> 29:23.380
I know.

29:23.380 --> 29:32.160
It's just like, what I assure you, I don't want to have my wedding in a church and I

29:32.160 --> 29:37.480
am not going to sue any church that doesn't want to have my wedding because I'm not, well,

29:37.480 --> 29:39.920
I just, people can do whatever they want to do.

29:39.920 --> 29:42.240
No, here's what I have to do, whatever you want to do.

29:42.240 --> 29:44.520
Let me do what I want to do here, Rob.

29:44.520 --> 29:45.520
Here's what I have to say.

29:45.520 --> 29:46.520
What is it?

29:46.520 --> 29:47.520
Okay.

29:47.520 --> 29:53.700
If you know, the, the fundamental Christians want to use Leviticus as their standing point

29:53.700 --> 29:57.440
for saying, you know, which is actually in Jewish law, man shall not lay with another

29:57.440 --> 29:58.700
man like a woman.

29:58.700 --> 30:00.840
That just means that I guess you can't have boobs or something.

30:00.840 --> 30:06.200
Um, but anyway, if, if the Christians want to use Leviticus, they also have to keep kosher

30:06.200 --> 30:10.800
and grow out their beards and wear tall black hats like the Hasidic do.

30:10.800 --> 30:12.760
I put the fun in fundamentalist.

30:12.760 --> 30:17.600
Well it's not even, here's the thing, quote the Bible all you want or any religious text,

30:17.600 --> 30:23.260
but there's like an amendment in the constitution that says freedom of religion, meaning I am

30:23.260 --> 30:24.760
free of your religion.

30:24.760 --> 30:26.840
Well see, and that's, that's my other point.

30:26.840 --> 30:35.400
I mean, my point is that if they're trying to use, if they're trying to use a law when

30:35.400 --> 30:42.760
they admittedly don't follow the laws themselves, then that's just being hypocritical.

30:42.760 --> 30:43.760
Here's the end of the thing.

30:43.760 --> 30:48.040
I am encouraged by the fact that folks our age, and I see a lot of people in chat going,

30:48.040 --> 30:49.200
I have a gay friend who cares.

30:49.200 --> 30:50.200
I don't care.

30:50.200 --> 30:55.880
You know, and that, that seems to be the attitude of most 18 to 35 year olds in this day and

30:55.880 --> 30:56.880
age.

30:56.880 --> 30:57.880
They just need to vote.

30:57.880 --> 31:02.640
So the good news is when we're the old farts on the Supreme Court making the decisions,

31:02.640 --> 31:03.640
this will be over.

31:03.640 --> 31:04.640
Yeah.

31:04.640 --> 31:07.520
We're just going to have to wait for the ignorant people to pass on.

31:07.520 --> 31:13.260
Well, I mean, if you, if you take a look at the civil rights movement, the 14th amendment

31:13.260 --> 31:19.920
passed a hundred years before Brown versus the Board of Education and the, and the Montgomery

31:19.920 --> 31:25.040
boycott, the Montgomery bus boycott with Rosa Parks.

31:25.040 --> 31:29.680
And so how many of us our age look back on that and go, God, they were so dumb.

31:29.680 --> 31:31.760
Like what was the big fucking deal?

31:31.760 --> 31:33.760
Like when, right.

31:33.760 --> 31:34.760
Yeah.

31:34.760 --> 31:39.800
But when the Plessy case went, there's people who were old, old, you know, were young at

31:39.800 --> 31:45.500
that time who disagreed, who were older at that time and voted in the new way.

31:45.500 --> 31:47.080
That's you're exactly right.

31:47.080 --> 31:50.160
Our history is teaching us right now that eventually all of those people with the big

31:50.160 --> 31:52.160
stick up their ass are going to be dead.

31:52.160 --> 31:56.280
And guess who gets to step in?

31:56.280 --> 32:01.760
So even if I'm not around to see it, I know someday it will change.

32:01.760 --> 32:02.760
And that's that.

32:02.760 --> 32:03.760
We'll be able to marry Pikachu.

32:03.760 --> 32:07.560
But you know, if anyone is still listening, is anyone still listening?

32:07.560 --> 32:10.400
Yeah, we actually have a few people still listening believe it or not.

32:10.400 --> 32:13.900
I'm just saying if anyone is still listening, make sure that when the opportunity comes

32:13.900 --> 32:18.000
up for you to vote and important issues like this, that you do it because I was watching

32:18.000 --> 32:22.020
the voter turnout during the whole Prop 8 thing and I was completely dismayed.

32:22.020 --> 32:26.400
They were, we were really relying on, you know, the Berkeley area and you know, the

32:26.400 --> 32:31.760
voter turnout was only something like 52% and it could have completely turned the whole

32:31.760 --> 32:36.120
thing because the vote was 52 to 49.

32:36.120 --> 32:40.400
Just if the rest of the voting population had put in the effort, it wouldn't have even

32:40.400 --> 32:41.400
been an issue.

32:41.400 --> 32:43.400
So, I'm just saying.

32:43.400 --> 32:47.360
This was a very interesting election year though, because either way the tide had gone,

32:47.360 --> 32:49.480
you were going to have a minority in the White House.

32:49.480 --> 32:53.080
Either you had a racial minority or you had the sexual minority.

32:53.080 --> 32:55.940
You would have had one crazy ass fucking woman in the White House, but you would have had

32:55.940 --> 32:57.880
a woman in the White House, you know?

32:57.880 --> 33:03.080
You know what, you know what, I think my problem with Hillary is that she, uh,

33:03.080 --> 33:04.080
No, I don't.

33:04.080 --> 33:05.080
I'm not talking to her.

33:05.080 --> 33:06.080
I'm talking Sarah Palin.

33:06.080 --> 33:13.400
Hillary doesn't win the primaries, but despite whatever, whatever happened, you would have

33:13.400 --> 33:15.080
had a minority in the White House when we were there.

33:15.080 --> 33:23.240
I thought, I thought it was two minorities right there, two minorities in one, and that's

33:23.240 --> 33:24.240
going to be the bill.

33:24.240 --> 33:25.240
This is what we need.

33:25.240 --> 33:29.360
What we need, Rob, is a Jewish black woman.

33:29.360 --> 33:32.600
What we need is just someone who's not a dick.

33:32.600 --> 33:34.480
Like that's just all I want.

33:34.480 --> 33:36.680
And I, I'm not going to get too political.

33:36.680 --> 33:43.560
That means I'll never be president, because I put the dick in the dictator.

33:43.560 --> 33:46.480
No, I, I, we need Renna.

33:46.480 --> 33:47.480
We need Renna.

33:47.480 --> 33:48.480
President cat.

33:48.480 --> 33:49.480
That's right.

33:49.480 --> 33:50.480
That's what we need.

33:50.480 --> 33:51.480
President cat.

33:51.480 --> 33:52.480
You will meow this mess.

33:52.480 --> 33:53.840
All right.

33:53.840 --> 33:56.520
Should we declare nuclear war?

33:56.520 --> 34:01.080
Would you like to play a game?

34:01.080 --> 34:03.040
Let's go to the fortune cookie message of the day.

34:03.040 --> 34:04.120
This show is getting too deep.

34:04.120 --> 34:07.480
I mean, this is just, this is supposed to be a haha funny show.

34:07.480 --> 34:08.480
We sung the thing.

34:08.480 --> 34:09.480
The segment's over.

34:09.480 --> 34:10.480
Quit asking questions.

34:10.480 --> 34:15.960
Yeah, but this is, this is erotic chat and gold shire.

34:15.960 --> 34:16.960
Keep in mind.

34:16.960 --> 34:18.520
This is what happens when geeks grow up.

34:18.520 --> 34:19.520
Yep.

34:19.520 --> 34:20.520
Guess what?

34:20.520 --> 34:25.520
All you kids, you're going to read geek life, geek-life.com.

34:25.520 --> 34:26.520
That guy from Sweden.

34:26.520 --> 34:27.520
Here.

34:27.520 --> 34:28.520
Here it is.

34:28.520 --> 34:29.520
Your fortune.

34:29.520 --> 34:30.520
I think he is our age.

34:30.520 --> 34:36.880
Here's your fortune cookie message of the day kids.

34:36.880 --> 34:39.500
That's a fucking leprechaun.

34:39.500 --> 34:41.000
That's rock star shit.

34:41.000 --> 34:43.280
The leprechaun is amazing.

34:43.280 --> 34:44.960
I'll eat your dog and shine your shoes.

34:44.960 --> 34:45.960
Fuck you.

34:45.960 --> 34:46.960
I'm a leprechaun.

34:46.960 --> 34:47.960
Magically delicious.

34:47.960 --> 34:48.960
Yellow moons.

34:48.960 --> 34:49.960
Pink hearts.

34:49.960 --> 34:50.960
Fuck you.

34:50.960 --> 34:51.960
I'll eat your dog and shine your shoes.

34:51.960 --> 34:53.600
They'll eat your fucking dog.

34:53.600 --> 34:57.960
They're not fucking around and they'll shine your shoes.

34:57.960 --> 34:59.880
That's a complete 180.

34:59.880 --> 35:02.480
I saw the movie leprechaun years back.

35:02.480 --> 35:04.480
Awesome piece of film.

35:04.480 --> 35:07.000
They eat your dog, but they'll shine your shoes.

35:07.000 --> 35:08.600
One minute, the next minute.

35:08.600 --> 35:09.600
You know what?

35:09.600 --> 35:14.920
My dog's important to me because my dog licks, but a fucking leprechaun.

35:14.920 --> 35:18.520
Whoever came up with that, by the way, fucking genius.

35:18.520 --> 35:19.920
They are drunk.

35:19.920 --> 35:20.920
They're mean.

35:20.920 --> 35:21.920
They're green.

35:21.920 --> 35:22.920
They got rotted teeth.

35:22.920 --> 35:23.920
All they care about is money.

35:23.920 --> 35:24.920
They're my agent.

35:24.920 --> 35:26.520
I'll eat your dog and shine your shoes.

35:26.520 --> 35:27.520
Fuck you.

35:27.520 --> 35:29.520
I'm a spring.

35:29.520 --> 35:31.480
They're wonderful little fucking creatures.

35:31.480 --> 35:35.640
If you go outside when you leave here tonight, you fucking see a leprechaun.

35:35.640 --> 35:37.640
You shoot that mother fucking thing.

35:37.640 --> 35:38.640
You kill that dead.

35:38.640 --> 35:39.640
You put that down.

35:39.640 --> 35:43.040
That was Bob Saget, believe it or not.

35:43.040 --> 35:44.040
That's crazy.

35:44.040 --> 35:45.040
Isn't it?

35:45.040 --> 35:46.040
Crazy.

35:46.040 --> 35:48.160

36:02.440 --> 36:03.440
No, we like them.

36:03.440 --> 36:04.440
Derek's cool.

36:04.440 --> 36:05.440
He put on the big battle.

36:05.440 --> 36:06.440
He's a good guy.
