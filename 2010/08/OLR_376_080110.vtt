00:00.000 --> 00:20.180
Tonight, August 1st, 2010, a big MMO plans a free-to-play model, Valve accidentally

00:20.180 --> 00:29.980
bans 12,000 players, and the creator of Ultima wins $28 million from his former company.

00:29.980 --> 00:35.600
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge

00:35.600 --> 00:36.600
Radio.

00:36.600 --> 00:41.320
We are that program dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer

00:41.320 --> 00:42.320
lifestyle.

00:42.320 --> 00:44.980
We are that show where every gamer has a voice.

00:44.980 --> 00:45.980
My name is Rob Roberts.

00:45.980 --> 00:50.080
I'll be joining you over the next few hours here at All Games Radio, where we tape live

00:50.080 --> 00:55.080
every Sunday night, www.allgames.com, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, 6 o'clock

00:55.080 --> 00:56.400
Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.

00:56.400 --> 00:58.740
Boy, we say a lot in this intro.

00:58.740 --> 01:02.760
The consoling voice over there in the corner, also joining us over the next few hours, Dark

01:02.760 --> 01:03.760
Sakura, Jamie Summers.

01:03.760 --> 01:07.800
We're also into game and meat, because elk is really tasty.

01:07.800 --> 01:11.480
I didn't know you were dining on meat this week.

01:11.480 --> 01:15.360
Every so often I dine on the meat, but I do not necessarily chow on the cow, and I definitely

01:15.360 --> 01:16.360
don't dine on the swine.

01:16.360 --> 01:18.480
Chow on the cow and dine on the swine, alright.

01:18.480 --> 01:21.280
Remember, I got that from Danielle back in the day.

01:21.280 --> 01:22.280
Oh my gosh.

01:22.280 --> 01:23.280
Yep.

01:23.280 --> 01:24.280
Wow.

01:24.280 --> 01:26.720
I don't chow on cow and I don't dine on swine.

01:26.720 --> 01:28.280
She was crazier than Sarah Palin.

01:28.280 --> 01:29.280
Alright.

01:29.280 --> 01:30.280
Um.

01:30.280 --> 01:31.280
Look.

01:31.280 --> 01:36.920
Let me, let me move on to introducing guests, on to happier topics.

01:36.920 --> 01:40.040
Let's talk about Loki is not here tonight.

01:40.040 --> 01:44.400
Loki's not here, because this is the day that we knew was going to be coming for some time.

01:44.400 --> 01:48.880
Loki's going to be out for a few shows, because Loki, Miss Loki, went into labor this morning

01:48.880 --> 01:50.060
at 11 a.m.

01:50.060 --> 01:51.060
That's all we know.

01:51.060 --> 01:52.640
We don't have a lot of updates other than that.

01:52.640 --> 01:56.920
The baby is not here, or at least the arrival has not been announced on Facebook, but if

01:56.920 --> 02:00.400
I were Loki, I would not be running to Facebook to announce the birth first thing.

02:00.400 --> 02:07.320
My guess is that they do have a tiny one right now, who is currently doing a lot of sleeping,

02:07.320 --> 02:08.840
as is mommy.

02:08.840 --> 02:14.800
So during sleep time, we should start seeing the messages, because the, the, the body goes

02:14.800 --> 02:18.360
through quite a lot of hell in childbirth.

02:18.360 --> 02:19.360
So uh.

02:19.360 --> 02:20.360
Yeah.

02:20.360 --> 02:22.160
Being born is hard work.

02:22.160 --> 02:24.360
It's a lot of pushing.

02:24.360 --> 02:28.840
Alright, uh, we're going to, uh, so we do have some guests here, because this all happened

02:28.840 --> 02:33.080
this morning, we weren't really prepared to have another co-host come in.

02:33.080 --> 02:36.680
We are going to have something a little more permanent, um, well, not, not permanent, because

02:36.680 --> 02:37.880
obviously Loki's not being replaced.

02:37.880 --> 02:41.600
God, no, he'll come back, uh, but you know, for about the next month or so, while Loki's

02:41.600 --> 02:46.440
off being a daddy, uh, we'll have a more long-term co-host next week, uh, but for now, we have

02:46.440 --> 02:47.440
some special guests.

02:47.440 --> 02:48.440
I have a co-host, Rob.

02:48.440 --> 02:49.440
What's that?

02:49.440 --> 02:50.440
Where is it?

02:50.440 --> 02:52.440
Ah, how your co-host fails.

02:52.440 --> 02:53.440
Alright.

02:53.440 --> 02:55.520
Next guest is turned for me.

02:55.520 --> 03:00.320
Okay, the batteries are dying on the Dalek, that ought to tell you something.

03:00.320 --> 03:01.320
No, it's not dying.

03:01.320 --> 03:03.440
It needs to exterminate itself.

03:03.440 --> 03:05.320
We do have some guests here in studio tonight.

03:05.320 --> 03:09.360
Let's say hello first to, uh, and I, I've met both of these guests for the first and

03:09.360 --> 03:14.360
second time tonight, so I apologize if I'm mispronouncing you, but you're Mila?

03:14.360 --> 03:15.360
Myla.

03:15.360 --> 03:16.360
Myla.

03:16.360 --> 03:17.360
Myla Minoke.

03:17.360 --> 03:18.360
How are you, Myla Minoke?

03:18.360 --> 03:23.360
I am doing very well, my sir, and I'm glad to be your guest on the show.

03:23.360 --> 03:27.800
We don't, wait, we're not hearing you at all, and I'm trying to figure out why.

03:27.800 --> 03:28.800
Turn my mic.

03:28.800 --> 03:31.360
See, Rob, you were afraid that my mic was going to be crappy.

03:31.360 --> 03:32.360
What is going on?

03:32.360 --> 03:33.400
Is this, is the switch on?

03:33.400 --> 03:34.400
That's always a common mistake.

03:34.400 --> 03:35.400
Yes.

03:35.400 --> 03:36.400
Hello out there in Disneyland.

03:36.400 --> 03:37.400
Much better.

03:37.400 --> 03:38.400
Hello.

03:38.400 --> 03:39.400
Yes.

03:39.400 --> 03:40.400
First, first rule of radio, turn your mic on.

03:40.400 --> 03:41.400
Yeah, turn my mic on.

03:41.400 --> 03:42.400
So, yes.

03:42.400 --> 03:43.400
Let's try this from the top.

03:43.400 --> 03:44.400
Myla.

03:44.400 --> 03:45.400
Hi there.

03:45.400 --> 03:46.400
How are you?

03:46.400 --> 03:47.400
I'm doing fantastic.

03:47.400 --> 03:50.760
Um, I'm actually, I was actually turned onto the show by our wonderful, uh, intern, Dronami,

03:50.760 --> 03:55.160
and I am, I guess I'm the sub-intern, I guess I count, as the sub-intern.

03:55.160 --> 03:56.160
You're the intern's intern.

03:56.160 --> 03:57.560
You're the, you're the intern's gopher.

03:57.560 --> 03:58.560
Yeah, I'm the gopher.

03:58.560 --> 03:59.560
You're the gopher.

03:59.560 --> 04:00.560
Aw, dammit.

04:00.560 --> 04:04.720
Now you, but you have a lot in common gaming-wise with intern Drew, right?

04:04.720 --> 04:05.720
Yes.

04:05.720 --> 04:08.360
What, you're, you, you described yourself to me as like a budget gamer.

04:08.360 --> 04:09.720
That's the type of video games you're into?

04:09.720 --> 04:10.720
Yes.

04:10.720 --> 04:13.840
Um, if it costs less than ten bucks, I've usually either played it, played it or bought

04:13.840 --> 04:14.840
it.

04:14.840 --> 04:15.840
So.

04:15.840 --> 04:16.840
Yeah.

04:16.840 --> 04:17.840
I'm, I'm usually very much on the budget gaming.

04:17.840 --> 04:20.880
So much so that my MMO of choice is RuneScape.

04:20.880 --> 04:21.880
Why?

04:21.880 --> 04:23.000
Cause it's free.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.640
We have news about a free MMO tonight, a new one going free.

04:25.640 --> 04:27.120
So we'll talk about that a little later.

04:27.120 --> 04:28.120
Very much.

04:28.120 --> 04:31.800
But also we had a very interesting, um, meeting you and I did.

04:31.800 --> 04:32.800
Yeah.

04:32.800 --> 04:34.000
Thanks to a particular somebody else in this room.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.800
So let's get to him and then talk about the meeting.

04:35.800 --> 04:36.800
Okay.

04:36.800 --> 04:37.800
So let's introduce somebody else.

04:37.800 --> 04:39.360
So we also have joining us tonight, Gary.

04:39.360 --> 04:40.360
Yes.

04:40.360 --> 04:41.360
Yep.

04:41.360 --> 04:42.360
That's me.

04:42.360 --> 04:43.360
How you doing, Gary?

04:43.360 --> 04:44.360
Um, all right.

04:44.360 --> 04:45.360
Glad to be here.

04:45.360 --> 04:46.360
Yes.

04:46.360 --> 04:47.360
He's a friend of Punk Night.

04:47.360 --> 04:48.360
Yeah.

04:48.360 --> 04:50.680
Everybody is so like, like randomly connected to OLR somehow.

04:50.680 --> 04:51.680
I've got to forget this.

04:51.680 --> 04:54.680
You might know me as Mindstorm or SMF 2045 online.

04:54.680 --> 04:55.680
Okay.

04:55.680 --> 04:56.680
Either one of those.

04:56.680 --> 04:57.680
Right on.

04:57.680 --> 04:58.680
Um.

04:58.680 --> 04:59.680
That'd be smf.

04:59.680 --> 05:00.680
Getting back.

05:00.680 --> 05:01.680
Yeah.

05:01.680 --> 05:02.680
Whatever.

05:02.680 --> 05:03.680
It's an acronym.

05:03.680 --> 05:04.680
I'll explain later.

05:04.680 --> 05:05.680
I know.

05:05.680 --> 05:10.000
But, um, trying to get back into console gaming after hiatus of several years, um, need to

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
get caught up.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
He plays a lot of D&D.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.520
I'm hoping we can talk about something you're into tonight.

05:14.520 --> 05:17.480
Now, yeah, you, you confessed to me before the show that you're just, you're just kind

05:17.480 --> 05:20.720
of here for the atmosphere tonight cause you don't really play a lot of console games or

05:20.720 --> 05:21.720
PC games.

05:21.720 --> 05:22.720
Right?

05:22.720 --> 05:23.720
You play games.

05:23.720 --> 05:24.720
Not entirely true.

05:24.720 --> 05:25.720
Okay.

05:25.720 --> 05:26.720
Okay.

05:26.720 --> 05:28.680
I, well, I got the impression you're more of a games that involve more than six sides

05:28.680 --> 05:29.680
on my dice.

05:29.680 --> 05:30.680
Yes.

05:30.680 --> 05:31.680
I'm a tabletop gamer.

05:31.680 --> 05:32.680
Nothing wrong with that.

05:32.680 --> 05:36.040
But thanks to Dark, Dark Sakura, I picked up SimCity 3 and when I get a, when I get a chance

05:36.040 --> 05:37.040
to play it, I love it.

05:37.040 --> 05:38.040
SimCity?

05:38.040 --> 05:39.040
Sims 3.

05:39.040 --> 05:40.040
Sims 3.

05:40.040 --> 05:41.040
Sims 3.

05:41.040 --> 05:42.040
Yes.

05:42.040 --> 05:43.040
There was a SimCity 3.

05:43.040 --> 05:44.040
I know.

05:44.040 --> 05:45.040
But you mod them.

05:45.040 --> 05:48.200
No, I left off SimCity a long time ago.

05:48.200 --> 05:49.720
I just downloaded boob sliders.

05:49.720 --> 05:51.040
Well, I do.

05:51.040 --> 05:53.280
This isn't the first time I've met Gary.

05:53.280 --> 05:55.920
The first time I met Gary was at Jamie's rock band party.

05:55.920 --> 05:56.920
Oh yes.

05:56.920 --> 05:57.920
Rock band.

05:57.920 --> 05:58.920
The beer potluck.

05:58.920 --> 05:59.920
Oh yes.

05:59.920 --> 06:00.920
That was technically the beer potluck.

06:00.920 --> 06:01.920
I don't remember the beer potluck.

06:01.920 --> 06:02.920
When was that?

06:02.920 --> 06:03.920
Your mic is dying.

06:03.920 --> 06:04.920
I don't know.

06:04.920 --> 06:05.920
Ouch.

06:05.920 --> 06:06.920
My ears.

06:06.920 --> 06:07.920
Jamie.

06:07.920 --> 06:08.920
Okay.

06:08.920 --> 06:15.280
So everyone was, I told everyone to bring beer so we could have a beer potluck and Gary

06:15.280 --> 06:17.040
brought meat which was almost as good.

06:17.040 --> 06:18.960
Yeah, because I don't drink.

06:18.960 --> 06:19.960
No.

06:19.960 --> 06:25.000
But, but, you know, we finally, I still have one Guinness left from that time, Rob.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
One Guinness.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.920
And I'm gonna drink the fuck out of that Guinness.

06:27.920 --> 06:31.440
And you'll be able to skip a meal when you do because Guinness is liquid bread.

06:31.440 --> 06:32.440
Oh, yummy.

06:32.440 --> 06:36.840
But, but that's gonna be my celebration for being off Vicodin because my hand is fucked

06:36.840 --> 06:37.840
up even more now.

06:37.840 --> 06:38.840
Aw.

06:38.840 --> 06:39.840
And by the way, thanks for the peach beer.

06:39.840 --> 06:40.840
It was delicious.

06:40.840 --> 06:41.840
Yes.

06:41.840 --> 06:42.840
I couldn't.

06:42.840 --> 06:43.840
You remember I couldn't drink the, the peach Lombek.

06:43.840 --> 06:44.840
Oh yeah.

06:44.840 --> 06:45.840
I gave it to her.

06:45.840 --> 06:46.840
Nice.

06:46.840 --> 06:47.840
It was wonderful.

06:47.840 --> 06:48.840
I loved it.

06:48.840 --> 06:49.840
Yeah.

06:49.840 --> 06:50.840
So, um, so now for the story.

06:50.840 --> 06:51.840
Yay.

06:51.840 --> 06:52.840
Oh, story time?

06:52.840 --> 06:53.840
Yes.

06:53.840 --> 06:54.840
This is how we met.

06:54.840 --> 06:55.840
Ashley.

06:55.840 --> 06:56.840
Uh, Myla.

06:56.840 --> 06:57.840
Yeah.

06:57.840 --> 06:58.840
We, we skip names all the time.

06:58.840 --> 07:04.880
So anyway, um, Gary tells me that on our way to Shule downtown that we're picking up somebody.

07:04.880 --> 07:11.160
So I instantly am pounced, hugged by this person and I'm like, okay, hi, you're fun.

07:11.160 --> 07:12.920
I instantly like you.

07:12.920 --> 07:16.840
And then we, she's talking about playing DDR and I said, Oh yeah, I used to moderate on

07:16.840 --> 07:17.840
DDR freak.

07:17.840 --> 07:18.840
It was dark Sakura.

07:18.840 --> 07:26.120
And she's like from orange lounge, you know, drew a funny small world in it.

07:26.120 --> 07:28.000
So we both called him and left him.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.720
Um, what the fuck voice messages?

07:29.720 --> 07:30.720
Wait a minute.

07:30.720 --> 07:31.720
Wait a minute.

07:31.720 --> 07:32.840
Is tonight on OLR like Jew party?

07:32.840 --> 07:34.360
Is that what this is tonight?

07:34.360 --> 07:35.360
What's the matter?

07:35.360 --> 07:36.360
I don't count.

07:36.360 --> 07:37.360
Oh, okay.

07:37.360 --> 07:38.360
Oh, I thought, Oh, I thought you.

07:38.360 --> 07:39.360
Oh, okay.

07:39.360 --> 07:41.840
Is it the people in this room are only half true.

07:41.840 --> 07:43.720
There's only half Jewish.

07:43.720 --> 07:44.720
Yeah.

07:44.720 --> 07:45.720
I'm Jewish by proxy.

07:45.720 --> 07:46.720
Okay.

07:46.720 --> 07:47.720
All right.

07:47.720 --> 07:51.160
So we have Jew, Jew by proxy, Jew in training and not Jew.

07:51.160 --> 07:52.160
Okay.

07:52.160 --> 07:53.160
And gay.

07:53.160 --> 07:56.320
The short, the short word for not Jew is goi.

07:56.320 --> 07:58.640
Well, welcome, welcome to the world.

07:58.640 --> 07:59.640
Here's your Yiddish lesson.

07:59.640 --> 08:03.800
I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, welcome to the world of oppressive of oppressed peoples.

08:03.800 --> 08:04.800
Yes.

08:04.800 --> 08:06.520
But, but I love, I love the Jewish people.

08:06.520 --> 08:10.680
I would say I'm a, I'm a, like, I'm not a fag hag, but I'm a, I'm a Jew.

08:10.680 --> 08:11.680
I'm a Jew hag.

08:11.680 --> 08:12.680
I don't know.

08:12.680 --> 08:13.680
What would you call it?

08:13.680 --> 08:16.600
Like a, like somebody who likes to hang out.

08:16.600 --> 08:17.600
You're a goi toy.

08:17.600 --> 08:18.600
A goi toy.

08:18.600 --> 08:19.600
There you go.

08:19.600 --> 08:20.600
All right.

08:20.600 --> 08:21.600
Don't mind us.

08:21.600 --> 08:25.240
We're geeks, we're gamers and we're fun.

08:25.240 --> 08:26.880
And, and very silly.

08:26.880 --> 08:31.560
Honestly, guys, this is one of those weeks where I don't know why we're doing a show

08:31.560 --> 08:32.560
tonight.

08:32.560 --> 08:33.920
Like, why not?

08:33.920 --> 08:38.400
I think it's because we need, we need this, Rob, for some reason, guys, like we decided

08:38.400 --> 08:42.800
to do the, the trial Facebook ad campaign this week, which I'll talk about in a minute.

08:42.800 --> 08:45.480
It's not, it's not a big deal, but you know, we're, we're trying to get word out there

08:45.480 --> 08:46.860
more about the show.

08:46.860 --> 08:50.080
And so we probably have some brand new people listening for the first time tonight.

08:50.080 --> 08:51.080
We're sorry.

08:51.080 --> 08:55.840
And I'm thinking to myself, apologies in advance, please go back in the archives and listen

08:55.840 --> 08:57.560
like three 74 was a good show.

08:57.560 --> 09:01.000
I'm glad that you have these numbers memorized because I sure as hell don't.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.880
Hey, how do you know it's not going to be a good show tonight?

09:02.880 --> 09:03.880
No, it'll be fine.

09:03.880 --> 09:09.400
We're all like, and that being really fun, especially when we're completely just thrown

09:09.400 --> 09:10.400
off our patterns.

09:10.400 --> 09:11.400
Yeah.

09:11.400 --> 09:12.400
Random is hilarious.

09:12.400 --> 09:15.160
I think all of us tonight kind of collected, well, I can't speak for the guests, but I

09:15.160 --> 09:17.240
know Jamie and I just kind of don't give a fuck tonight.

09:17.240 --> 09:18.240
At least I don't.

09:18.240 --> 09:20.760
I, you guys have me on the show, so I know you don't give a fuck.

09:20.760 --> 09:23.760
You guys have me on the show, so it's proof you don't give a fuck.

09:23.760 --> 09:26.760
I gave a fuck, but I don't remember who I gave it to.

09:26.760 --> 09:27.760
Probably Dan.

09:27.760 --> 09:28.760
That's dangerous.

09:28.760 --> 09:34.280
But yeah, there was, um, we should probably get into the how was our weekend day and shit

09:34.280 --> 09:35.280
because there was some stuff.

09:35.280 --> 09:38.160
Well, technically it's how was your gaming week is how we start off.

09:38.160 --> 09:41.800
But I know, I know you're dying to talk about why you're off.

09:41.800 --> 09:43.280
I really don't have an excuse.

09:43.280 --> 09:45.040
I'm just, I'm on the rag.

09:45.040 --> 09:46.520
I'm on man rag tonight.

09:46.520 --> 09:47.720
I don't know what you'd call that.

09:47.720 --> 09:49.080
I have some Vagisil if you need it.

09:49.080 --> 09:50.240
I don't need that.

09:50.240 --> 09:51.240
That's for damn sure.

09:51.240 --> 09:52.240
I just need some freshening, Rob.

09:52.240 --> 09:53.240
Do you feel not so fresh?

09:53.240 --> 09:54.240
We could get you a douche.

09:54.240 --> 09:57.240
You know how, you're a douche.

09:57.240 --> 09:59.240
Your face is a douche.

09:59.240 --> 10:00.240
Ow.

10:00.240 --> 10:01.240
You know how.

10:01.240 --> 10:02.480
I'll friend your butt.

10:02.480 --> 10:05.560
I know you, I know you know what I'm talking about.

10:05.560 --> 10:10.560
You know how like, somebody will just tell you good morning and you'll want to be like,

10:10.560 --> 10:13.760
why are you looking at me like that?

10:13.760 --> 10:16.920
Although that makes it sound like it's about my relationship, but it's really, it's not

10:16.920 --> 10:18.600
like my relationship is awesome.

10:18.600 --> 10:23.160
I think Alan is the best thing ever, but I think everything else, everything else.

10:23.160 --> 10:24.960
I want him to be my gay boyfriend.

10:24.960 --> 10:28.080
But you're already, you can't have him, he's mine.

10:28.080 --> 10:29.080
All right.

10:29.080 --> 10:30.080
All right.

10:30.080 --> 10:35.280
Well, anyhow, so, so I'm just, I don't know, I'm just being a bitch tonight.

10:35.280 --> 10:36.840
What's, what's your excuse, DarkSaga?

10:36.840 --> 10:42.120
Well, um, and I'm, I'm going to go into details, kind of details about this, just because it's

10:42.120 --> 10:47.920
something that people, especially gamers with, who are stereotypically lazy gamers who eat

10:47.920 --> 10:51.400
Cheetos and all kinds of crap, need to be freaking aware.

10:51.400 --> 10:55.640
We don't know any of those, as I need chips during the show.

10:55.640 --> 10:56.640
S-T-F-U.

10:56.640 --> 10:59.480
Rob, you're eating something kind of healthy.

10:59.480 --> 11:00.480
Kind of.

11:00.480 --> 11:03.120
I had a banana for breakfast anyway.

11:03.120 --> 11:10.720
My husband, Dan, age 34, went into the hospital Tuesday morning at a quarter after three for

11:10.720 --> 11:12.720
congestive heart failure.

11:12.720 --> 11:14.800
My husband is 34 years old.

11:14.800 --> 11:20.920
This is something that you could die from or suffer massive damage to your other organs.

11:20.920 --> 11:25.400
Eventually he was coughing up blood and feeling really short of breath.

11:25.400 --> 11:29.840
He didn't have any of the pain or numbness, so thankfully his heart was in good shape.

11:29.840 --> 11:34.800
Um, but he's, he went in early Tuesday morning and got to leave Friday afternoon or actually

11:34.800 --> 11:39.160
more like Friday evening and, um, his blood pressure was super high.

11:39.160 --> 11:45.320
Thankfully after numerous ultrasounds and x-rays and what give you rays and tests and

11:45.320 --> 11:51.040
things and prodding, lots of prodding, um, he, um, they determined that all the rest

11:51.040 --> 11:56.480
of him worked just fine and he didn't damage his organs and he could come home, but he's

11:56.480 --> 12:02.200
on blood pressure medication now, quite a bit of it and, um, low sodium diet.

12:02.200 --> 12:05.680
And this is just a word of warning, you know, Dan said that, you know, I'd been harping

12:05.680 --> 12:10.040
on him, you've heard me harp on him, you know, people have been telling him and he just was

12:10.040 --> 12:13.320
not ready to believe it until it finally happened to him.

12:13.320 --> 12:17.800
And I warn everybody out there, and we've got someone in the room who's been through

12:17.800 --> 12:18.800
the same, similar.

12:18.800 --> 12:24.520
Yeah, mine wasn't quite as serious, but President's Day weekend this year actually, um, I was

12:24.520 --> 12:30.480
at a game convention and I felt really sick, uh, to the point where I got stuck in the

12:30.480 --> 12:35.880
lobby of the convention, uh, and paramedics came because I felt faint, didn't feel like

12:35.880 --> 12:40.960
I could get up, um, missed a day at the convention because I was convalescing, managed to drive

12:40.960 --> 12:45.640
back to Sacramento, but then that week, um, when I was going to bed one night, I started

12:45.640 --> 12:50.000
feeling dizzy, my heart was racing and I thought I was going to black out, so I called 911.

12:50.000 --> 12:55.440
They took me to the hospital and they told me that I had, I forget the exact medical

12:55.440 --> 12:59.280
name, but it was basically a viral infection of the lining of my heart, but it gave me

12:59.280 --> 13:04.300
very, very, very similar symptoms to congestive heart failure to the point where they gave

13:04.300 --> 13:08.260
me a pamphlet on congestive heart failure, what to eat, what not to eat, how to take

13:08.260 --> 13:09.260
care of yourself.

13:09.260 --> 13:14.400
So I can relate to Dan's situation and I definitely feel for you, this is scary and thank God

13:14.400 --> 13:15.400
you're getting through it.

13:15.400 --> 13:18.400
Let this be a warning to everybody.

13:18.400 --> 13:19.400
Mike.

13:19.400 --> 13:20.400
I am talking on my mic.

13:20.400 --> 13:21.400
It's, it's...

13:21.400 --> 13:22.400
LA!

13:22.400 --> 13:23.400
Your connection at the base is...

13:23.400 --> 13:24.400
Okay, I'm holding it in.

13:24.400 --> 13:25.400
I'm holding it in.

13:25.400 --> 13:26.400
Yeah, I can hear you.

13:26.400 --> 13:27.400
Okay.

13:27.400 --> 13:28.400
Well, of course you can hear me.

13:28.400 --> 13:29.400
Well, I mean through your mic.

13:29.400 --> 13:30.400
Okay.

13:30.400 --> 13:34.000
Anyway, um, let this be a warning to everybody that, you know, don't think this can't happen

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
to me.

13:35.000 --> 13:39.920
I really, and, and I know, and again, it's like with Dan's situation, he wasn't ready

13:39.920 --> 13:43.320
to change until he got slapped in the face with it.

13:43.320 --> 13:44.320
Yeah.

13:44.320 --> 13:47.120
I, I really warn everybody not to get to that point.

13:47.120 --> 13:51.480
So, and you know, in my show Solidarity for Dance, since he's got to be restrictive, I'm

13:51.480 --> 13:55.480
going back fully into my 70 to 80% raw food.

13:55.480 --> 13:57.920
Um, I am going to stick with it.

13:57.920 --> 14:01.320
I've bought dance pads so we can play DDR at home.

14:01.320 --> 14:02.320
Nice.

14:02.320 --> 14:03.320
Yeah, this, let this be a lesson.

14:03.320 --> 14:04.320
Get this, get this.

14:04.320 --> 14:08.240
I mean, you know, we used to, we've got tons of dance pads, but I found, um, uh, not Cobalt

14:08.240 --> 14:09.240
Flux.

14:09.240 --> 14:10.240
What are the other ones called?

14:10.240 --> 14:11.240
Ignitions.

14:11.240 --> 14:12.240
Ignition pads.

14:12.240 --> 14:16.760
Three of them for, um, for $6 at the thrift store.

14:16.760 --> 14:18.520
I don't know if they work, but they were in good shape.

14:18.520 --> 14:22.120
I'm going to clean the crap out of them and I'm gonna make Dan play some Boom Boom Dollar

14:22.120 --> 14:23.120
with me.

14:23.120 --> 14:24.120
Yay.

14:24.120 --> 14:25.120
Shoot.

14:25.120 --> 14:26.120
But, um, that sounds awesome.

14:26.120 --> 14:27.120
But that's what my week's been.

14:27.120 --> 14:33.200
So really, um, as far as going into gaming, I ain't played shit except for Ragnarok Online,

14:33.200 --> 14:34.560
which I'm playing again.

14:34.560 --> 14:39.600
And really I played that because it's so freaking, it was so mindless that I could just play

14:39.600 --> 14:43.400
in and not have to think because I wasn't able to sleep.

14:43.400 --> 14:48.080
I went that first day on an hour and a half of sleep and did not go to bed until something

14:48.080 --> 14:52.000
like I took, yeah, a little nap, which is my hour and a half of sleep.

14:52.000 --> 14:57.920
And then I was up until like three in the morning and I was up again at nine the next

14:57.920 --> 14:58.920
day.

14:58.920 --> 15:02.680
And I just, it's been, I slept really funny.

15:02.680 --> 15:06.400
And I've spent, I've never been so freaked out in my life, even though I knew he was

15:06.400 --> 15:11.400
in good hands, you know, and this is the other thing too.

15:11.400 --> 15:15.200
And you know, I know I'm probably going into a bit of personal detail, but I don't care.

15:15.200 --> 15:17.240
I have a microphone and I'm going to use it.

15:17.240 --> 15:19.880
Tonight's the feel good episode of OLR everybody.

15:19.880 --> 15:26.720
Don't make me bust out the booze, Hila.

15:26.720 --> 15:33.600
At any rate, um, the, uh, the way things were going, you know, Dan and I were talking about,

15:33.600 --> 15:37.040
you know, we've been talking about having a kid, me and Dan, I know I've been forthcoming

15:37.040 --> 15:38.040
on this, on the show.

15:38.040 --> 15:39.800
Cause I'm going to totally get Matt to do a nursery.

15:39.800 --> 15:41.200
Oh, mini Sakura.

15:41.200 --> 15:42.200
Yay.

15:42.200 --> 15:46.920
Is this a tangent where I can mention that Matt's nursery was actually on Game Informer,

15:46.920 --> 15:50.440
which I guess is that a big blog or magazine?

15:50.440 --> 15:51.440
I'm going to be honest.

15:51.440 --> 15:54.320
Game Informer is the one that's the GameStop one.

15:54.320 --> 15:55.320
Yes.

15:55.320 --> 15:56.320
Okay.

15:56.320 --> 15:59.400
So he was on that, but it had nothing to do with OLR.

15:59.400 --> 16:02.520
They found his pictures on Flickr.

16:02.520 --> 16:07.400
So just a heads up to everybody and not to get too tangenty from Dark Sakura's important

16:07.400 --> 16:10.200
story, but, um, be careful what you put up on the internet.

16:10.200 --> 16:11.520
I mean, obviously who cares about this?

16:11.520 --> 16:15.720
This is a good thing for Matt cause it's kind of cute that people care, but be careful.

16:15.720 --> 16:18.360
I will shove that iPhone sideways.

16:18.360 --> 16:19.360
Yeah.

16:19.360 --> 16:21.680
Sounds good to me.

16:21.680 --> 16:26.080
Here's the thing, but whatever you put on like Flickr, public Facebook, public Twitter

16:26.080 --> 16:27.880
can be picked up by like anybody.

16:27.880 --> 16:33.640
However, you can, um, you can copyright the photos and then they have to pay you.

16:33.640 --> 16:37.720
But in this case it's good news, but you just, you just gotta be careful what you put up

16:37.720 --> 16:38.720
on the internet.

16:38.720 --> 16:41.960
Just if it hadn't been good news, you know, you want to be, you want to be careful.

16:41.960 --> 16:42.960
Yeah.

16:42.960 --> 16:45.120
Just be careful what you say on your Facebook accounts.

16:45.120 --> 16:49.680
People have gotten fired from jobs because they said something their bosses didn't like.

16:49.680 --> 16:53.480
That's why mine is fully blocked and I don't allow, I really don't allow photo tagging.

16:53.480 --> 16:56.440
You know, if someone's tagged my stuff, I go look it up and I'll look at the stuff I

16:56.440 --> 16:57.440
tagged myself.

16:57.440 --> 17:00.760
Hate that Facebook does not let you approve what you get tagged in.

17:00.760 --> 17:03.600
But nobody can see, nobody can see my stuff.

17:03.600 --> 17:04.600
Okay.

17:04.600 --> 17:05.600
Nobody who's not a friend of yours.

17:05.600 --> 17:06.600
Yeah, exactly.

17:06.600 --> 17:07.600
All right.

17:07.600 --> 17:08.600
And I don't allow friend to friend viewing.

17:08.600 --> 17:09.600
Mm hmm.

17:09.600 --> 17:10.600
Understood.

17:10.600 --> 17:11.600
Yeah.

17:11.600 --> 17:12.600
Sorry.

17:12.600 --> 17:13.600
Sorry Jamie.

17:13.600 --> 17:14.600
Back to your traumatic week.

17:14.600 --> 17:15.600
Yes.

17:15.600 --> 17:16.600
So please share with us.

17:16.600 --> 17:17.600
Anyway.

17:17.600 --> 17:20.680
Well, you know, Dan and I were talking about having a kid and now I totally don't want

17:20.680 --> 17:24.680
to really do it until I'm sure he's going to stick with, with this as much as I would

17:24.680 --> 17:30.160
like when I want to make sure that, you know, and, and we were actually, the ironic thing

17:30.160 --> 17:34.960
is that we were talking about that Tuesday, um, Monday during the day is, you know, how,

17:34.960 --> 17:36.740
and I wasn't so much worried about him dying.

17:36.740 --> 17:39.760
I was worried about him not being able to keep up with a kid, you know, cause Dan's

17:39.760 --> 17:45.760
a big guy and now I'm actually worried about maybe, you know, him dying and I'm, you know,

17:45.760 --> 17:50.060
I'm 30, I'm, I'll say right now, I'm 34 years old, you know, Dan and I are coming up on

17:50.060 --> 17:52.440
our fifth anniversary on September 1st.

17:52.440 --> 17:58.660
We've been together for almost 14 years as of January and you know, I've never thought

17:58.660 --> 18:01.400
for an instant I was ever going to have to be without him.

18:01.400 --> 18:05.560
So it was, you know, and not that I'm saying that I'm one of those, oh, I'll die if you

18:05.560 --> 18:10.040
die, you know, or I can't go without you, I can't do anything by myself.

18:10.040 --> 18:12.840
You know, I'm not that one of those type of, of people.

18:12.840 --> 18:15.560
I would be okay.

18:15.560 --> 18:19.480
I would be incredibly depressed, but I would be okay.

18:19.480 --> 18:22.640
It's just that it's something that no one ever thinks about.

18:22.640 --> 18:28.200
So I also say, you know, uh, people out there, if you have a significant other or someone

18:28.200 --> 18:34.680
in your family that is at risk, you need to sit down and have the talk with them because

18:34.680 --> 18:38.120
when they think it can't happen, it does.

18:38.120 --> 18:41.760
And so, you know, even though we're being one of those game podcasts, yet another one

18:41.760 --> 18:46.160
that doesn't actually seem to talk about games for 30 minutes, this is important because,

18:46.160 --> 18:50.720
you know, if you are, you know, sitting there and you're, you're down in Doritos and maybe

18:50.720 --> 18:55.320
you're a little bit fluffy, you know, chances are me too.

18:55.320 --> 19:00.180
I think it's, you know, when it happens to all of us, I'm, I'm feeling a little fluffy

19:00.180 --> 19:01.180
right now.

19:01.180 --> 19:05.880
In fact, my grandpa, my grandma's got a refrigerator magnet says, I'm not fat, I'm fluffy, fluffy.

19:05.880 --> 19:07.520
It's something that it's something to watch out for.

19:07.520 --> 19:11.320
If you spend lots of time sitting, you know, I used to work in an office and, you know,

19:11.320 --> 19:12.800
play games, didn't get much exercise.

19:12.800 --> 19:16.280
It was a wake up call early this year.

19:16.280 --> 19:18.520
Even if you're not, well, I don't know about that.

19:18.520 --> 19:22.400
I don't know if I go that far, but I still want to borrow your Wii Fit.

19:22.400 --> 19:27.760
Even if you're not fluffy, it just, you know, take time to just kind of evaluate, you know,

19:27.760 --> 19:37.640
am I going outside enough, am I walking, am I maybe eating not so good as I could be?

19:37.640 --> 19:40.420
The straight Cheetos diet is not necessarily good for him.

19:40.420 --> 19:46.520
And this is, this is going to be our big thing is watch the refined carbohydrates, you know,

19:46.520 --> 19:47.520
watch the processed foods.

19:47.520 --> 19:52.400
Seriously, what, even if it says low sodium on the can, no, no, no, no, no, no.

19:52.400 --> 19:54.160
If it's canned, it's got sodium in it.

19:54.160 --> 19:55.160
It's not, yeah.

19:55.160 --> 19:58.160
Almost all the processed soups have tons of sodium on them.

19:58.160 --> 20:02.840
Like Dan's limited to 2000 calories, not calories, 2000 milligrams a day of sodium.

20:02.840 --> 20:05.120
They put me on a low sodium diet too.

20:05.120 --> 20:07.880
I can't eat anything in the canned soup aisle anymore.

20:07.880 --> 20:08.880
It's way too salty.

20:08.880 --> 20:13.320
I'm going to, even though dark soccer is giving you great advice and these are all important

20:13.320 --> 20:18.160
things that you should consider, like I'm going to give you like a diet so easy anybody

20:18.160 --> 20:19.160
can do it.

20:19.160 --> 20:22.060
Like seriously, you don't have to, you don't even have to look at the back of a package.

20:22.060 --> 20:23.060
This is it.

20:23.060 --> 20:24.060
This is the diet.

20:24.060 --> 20:25.060
This is the diet.

20:25.060 --> 20:26.060
This is how it works.

20:26.060 --> 20:27.060
It's called don't eat shit.

20:27.060 --> 20:31.360
Well, yeah, that's a given, but you'd be surprised how hard that is sometimes.

20:31.360 --> 20:37.680
You'd be surprised how much shit you're eating and I'm honest, I eat a lot of shit and I

20:37.680 --> 20:39.200
really need to cut back on that.

20:39.200 --> 20:41.720
I'm not, I don't, that was just mean.

20:41.720 --> 20:43.800
I don't mean actual poop shit.

20:43.800 --> 20:49.280
I mean crappy food, like McDonald's, Burger King, all that fast food crap.

20:49.280 --> 20:54.080
You know, everybody knows you're not stupid people.

20:54.080 --> 20:56.440
You know how to download a podcast on the internet.

20:56.440 --> 20:57.840
You're not dumb.

20:57.840 --> 21:02.240
You know what's good for you and what's not good for you and it's okay to indulge once

21:02.240 --> 21:03.240
in a while.

21:03.240 --> 21:08.240
God, I don't know where I would be in this world without chicken McNuggets, but you don't

21:08.240 --> 21:13.200
order the 20 pack of chicken McNuggets and you don't do it every day for one person.

21:13.200 --> 21:14.200
Get a happy meal.

21:14.200 --> 21:15.200
Yeah.

21:15.200 --> 21:16.200
You know, that's this.

21:16.200 --> 21:19.020
You know, the other bit of advice I have with this, and Dan is thankfully learning this

21:19.020 --> 21:24.840
now is just the eat when you're hungry, stop when you're not, not when you're full, when

21:24.840 --> 21:25.840
you're not hungry.

21:25.840 --> 21:30.440
And you also need to make sure you eat at regular intervals, breakfast, lunch, dinner,

21:30.440 --> 21:33.400
and maybe a small snack in between, but don't eat super late and stuff like that.

21:33.400 --> 21:35.400
I eat it eight times a day.

21:35.400 --> 21:37.560
Yes, that's good if you eat small meals a day.

21:37.560 --> 21:40.200
But I eat about 100 to 200 calories a pop.

21:40.200 --> 21:41.200
There you go.

21:41.200 --> 21:42.200
That's a small meal.

21:42.200 --> 21:45.480
But as long as I stick with my mostly raw food, I don't have to track what I eat.

21:45.480 --> 21:47.360
The one problem is that I don't get enough sodium.

21:47.360 --> 21:48.360
Irony.

21:48.360 --> 21:50.040
You have the opposite problem.

21:50.040 --> 21:51.720
I have the opposite problem, yep.

21:51.720 --> 21:52.720
Interesting.

21:52.720 --> 21:56.480
Because I eat mostly fruits and vegetables and they're raw and processed.

21:56.480 --> 21:59.840
If they're processed, it's because I threw them in my blender.

21:59.840 --> 22:01.400
But I know you eat beef occasionally.

22:01.400 --> 22:02.400
Sometimes.

22:02.400 --> 22:03.400
Occasionally.

22:03.400 --> 22:04.400
Sometimes.

22:04.400 --> 22:10.880
So anyway, um, we're going to get back in the games here, but, um, just, uh, you know,

22:10.880 --> 22:14.960
also I, this is important to say, there's nothing wrong if you are a little fluffy.

22:14.960 --> 22:15.960
Everybody's a little fluffy.

22:15.960 --> 22:17.200
It's in, it's fine.

22:17.200 --> 22:18.200
It's American.

22:18.200 --> 22:19.200
Somebody just...

22:19.200 --> 22:22.120
Love yourself the way you are, but make sure that you pay attention to your health.

22:22.120 --> 22:23.480
Just be fluffy and healthy.

22:23.480 --> 22:24.480
Yeah.

22:24.480 --> 22:29.160
You know, as one last little tangent, I was reading an article, something about, um, six

22:29.160 --> 22:36.420
months ago, I think, that was about, um, comparing skinny people to technically overweight people

22:36.420 --> 22:42.400
and how, um, a good number of people are, that are overweight are technically, um, in

22:42.400 --> 22:46.760
better shape than the skinny people that was talking about actually, um, what they were

22:46.760 --> 22:53.480
calling, um, low weight obesity, meaning that they had a higher range of, uh, fat to muscle

22:53.480 --> 22:55.020
ratio than these other people did.

22:55.020 --> 22:56.020
Never heard of that.

22:56.020 --> 22:57.020
Low weight obesity.

22:57.020 --> 22:58.020
Low weight obesity.

22:58.020 --> 23:00.080
Let's go to our chat room.

23:00.080 --> 23:05.000
You guys chat.orangelaungeradio.com where we like to leave, uh, leave, read comments.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
See, I told you I'm out of it tonight.

23:07.000 --> 23:11.320
As we do tape live on Sunday nights at all games radio, uh, Burr first comment tonight

23:11.320 --> 23:15.240
in our chat room at chat.orangelaungeradio.com says, his diet plan is to play so much.

23:15.240 --> 23:16.240
Wow.

23:16.240 --> 23:17.720
You don't have time to eat shit.

23:17.720 --> 23:23.000
Um, that's half true, but you'd be surprised how much shit you eat while you're sitting

23:23.000 --> 23:26.400
there in front of a computer playing games, usually because it's convenient and convenient

23:26.400 --> 23:28.640
food, convenient food is usually shitty food.

23:28.640 --> 23:29.640
Anyway, I'm sorry.

23:29.640 --> 23:32.320
I didn't mean to get on the health kick, but it is important.

23:32.320 --> 23:34.320
Obviously bring it up once in a while.

23:34.320 --> 23:38.440
And that when it hits you in the face like that is sort of like the best thing you can

23:38.440 --> 23:41.520
do is share it with other people so that they learn from your issues.

23:41.520 --> 23:42.520
True.

23:42.520 --> 23:43.520
True.

23:43.520 --> 23:44.520
No.

23:44.520 --> 23:45.520
And we do reach a wide audience on this show.

23:45.520 --> 23:51.080
So if we can save one other person from having to go to the hospital, then I was 20.

23:51.080 --> 23:52.080
Your mic again.

23:52.080 --> 23:53.080
Your mic's mad at you.

23:53.080 --> 23:54.080
Okay.

23:54.080 --> 23:55.080
Clearly.

23:55.080 --> 23:56.080
I was, I was mad.

23:56.080 --> 23:57.080
I got over being worried.

23:57.080 --> 24:03.760
I was mad because honestly, who does he have to blame for, for what happened to him, himself?

24:03.760 --> 24:06.680
When my genes get snug, who do I have to blame for that?

24:06.680 --> 24:07.680
Well, it's okay.

24:07.680 --> 24:13.320
Sometimes I have, you know, PMS to blame for that, but usually it's, it's me.

24:13.320 --> 24:15.720
You know, we have to be responsible for ourselves.

24:15.720 --> 24:16.720
Nothing.

24:16.720 --> 24:21.560
Like all those morons out there who are out there suing McDonald's and shit because, oh

24:21.560 --> 24:24.680
I ate your hamburgers and I got overweight, man.

24:24.680 --> 24:28.360
Well, don't eat the damn food, stupid.

24:28.360 --> 24:30.400
End of story.

24:30.400 --> 24:31.400
You know?

24:31.400 --> 24:32.400
So anyway, I'm sorry for going off that.

24:32.400 --> 24:33.780
So how about my games, Rob?

24:33.780 --> 24:34.780
How about your games?

24:34.780 --> 24:35.780
You already mentioned games.

24:35.780 --> 24:36.780
You didn't play a lot.

24:36.780 --> 24:41.480
But Star Trek Online episode two came out, which I got, I, you know, my hand has been

24:41.480 --> 24:45.920
killing me because, oh, on top of all this crap with Dan, my hand's infected.

24:45.920 --> 24:47.920
When I move my finger, it squishes.

24:47.920 --> 24:48.920
Ew.

24:48.920 --> 24:49.920
That's not good.

24:49.920 --> 24:50.920
That's really gross.

24:50.920 --> 24:51.920
I'm going to the doctor tomorrow.

24:51.920 --> 24:55.920
Anyway, so I couldn't really do much, but I did get to explore my ship.

24:55.920 --> 24:57.560
They've expanded the ships.

24:57.560 --> 24:59.440
I have an engineering deck.

24:59.440 --> 25:01.600
I have captain's quarters.

25:01.600 --> 25:05.520
I have a sick bay and a lounge and a ready room on my bridge.

25:05.520 --> 25:08.180
See, I got to get into this online Star Trek.

25:08.180 --> 25:09.180
This just sounds awesome.

25:09.180 --> 25:10.180
It's beautiful.

25:10.180 --> 25:15.120
But, so I didn't really get to do much except talk to my fleet mates and run around my ship

25:15.120 --> 25:16.120
like a crazy person.

25:16.120 --> 25:17.560
But it was really cool.

25:17.560 --> 25:22.000
In Star Trek Online, do you ever get to eject the warp core breach or the warp core because

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
of a breach or whatever?

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
No.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.000
Really?

25:25.000 --> 25:27.800
But my friend told me today that they're going to be doing on-ship missions.

25:27.800 --> 25:28.800
Yay.

25:28.800 --> 25:31.920
So maybe you do have a warp core breach.

25:31.920 --> 25:33.360
I meant eject the warp core.

25:33.360 --> 25:36.840
Of course my mind goes to the drink automatically, but yeah, eject the warp core because of a

25:36.840 --> 25:37.840
breach.

25:37.840 --> 25:38.840
Because that was like every episode of Star Trek.

25:38.840 --> 25:39.840
They had to eject the warp core.

25:39.840 --> 25:44.960
You know, I did find that the warp core breach was a legitimate drink from the show and he

25:44.960 --> 25:47.560
pulled it out in the same bowl and everything.

25:47.560 --> 25:48.560
Cork did.

25:48.560 --> 25:49.560
Good times.

25:49.560 --> 25:50.560
Anyway.

25:50.560 --> 25:51.560
All right.

25:51.560 --> 25:52.560
Is that it for your gaming week?

25:52.560 --> 25:58.560
Oh yeah, Dan's buddy Will started Crackdown 2, so we just kept making fun of the boss.

25:58.560 --> 26:00.600
Going, shut up, dude.

26:00.600 --> 26:02.400
We know.

26:02.400 --> 26:04.720
So anyway.

26:04.720 --> 26:10.340
My gaming week, you know, obviously I play a lot of Warcraft, as a chatter earlier said,

26:10.340 --> 26:13.960
but yourself.

26:13.960 --> 26:17.960
Our little raid group finally cleared the Trial of the Champion on 10man, which yes

26:17.960 --> 26:21.160
I know is like behind where most guilds are at right now, but we just started raiding

26:21.160 --> 26:22.480
like last month.

26:22.480 --> 26:23.480
So shut up.

26:23.480 --> 26:24.480
We're awesome.

26:24.480 --> 26:25.960
So that was fun.

26:25.960 --> 26:30.320
And other than that though, I've been trying to play games other than WoW, but I didn't

26:30.320 --> 26:31.720
have a lot of success this week.

26:31.720 --> 26:33.880
I did play some Game Room.

26:33.880 --> 26:36.480
I played Frostbite on Game Room, which just came out.

26:36.480 --> 26:40.040
That's an old, old, old school Atari 2600 game that I remember from when I was a kid.

26:40.040 --> 26:42.240
We used to stay up and play that for hours.

26:42.240 --> 26:43.320
And it's still kind of cool.

26:43.320 --> 26:47.680
Although I think a lot of you that don't get the classic gaming thing will not get this

26:47.680 --> 26:50.680
either, so I don't expect everybody to run out and download it.

26:50.680 --> 26:53.840
But the cool thing about Game Room, again, you can demo everything for 10 minutes, which

26:53.840 --> 26:59.240
is more than enough time to figure out if you like an old school arcade game or not.

26:59.240 --> 27:00.840
I've also been playing more Puzzle Quest II.

27:00.840 --> 27:04.760
I started the whole dang game over just so I could play as an assassin, because it seems

27:04.760 --> 27:08.440
like it's so much easier to just cut through things left and right, or I should say poison

27:08.440 --> 27:13.280
them to death, overload them with poison, as an assassin.

27:13.280 --> 27:16.760
Before I was playing the paladin-y type of class, it was more of a defender, and it's

27:16.760 --> 27:18.480
just like the matches went on forever.

27:18.480 --> 27:21.120
But as an assassin, I'm just like cutting people left and right.

27:21.120 --> 27:22.240
It's awesome.

27:22.240 --> 27:25.960
And this time, I hope to not miss any side quests like I did the first time.

27:25.960 --> 27:28.920
You know, that reminds me of when you were going around saying, bitch, I cut you.

27:28.920 --> 27:32.280
Yeah, it's kind of like that, but now I'm Puzzle Quest.

27:32.280 --> 27:33.280
New games this week.

27:33.280 --> 27:38.720
I did check out just the demo for Hydro Thunder Hurricane, because I wanted to see, and Jamie's

27:38.720 --> 27:40.440
yelling, it's awesome.

27:40.440 --> 27:42.560
I actually didn't really agree with her.

27:42.560 --> 27:47.000
I was just kind of like, eh, it's okay.

27:47.000 --> 27:51.140
There's something about playing that game in a big old cabinet at the arcade with other

27:51.140 --> 27:56.760
people that was much more fun to me than sitting at home in my chair playing it on my Xbox

27:56.760 --> 27:57.760
controller.

27:57.760 --> 27:58.760
I don't know.

27:58.760 --> 27:59.760
I just wasn't feeling it.

27:59.760 --> 28:01.400
The graphics didn't do it for me either.

28:01.400 --> 28:02.560
It's just something about it.

28:02.560 --> 28:05.840
Like I feel like it wasn't awesome.

28:05.840 --> 28:08.560
But you know, again, I'm only playing a demo.

28:08.560 --> 28:10.360
I'm not trying to review the whole game.

28:10.360 --> 28:13.920
I'm just saying, was I sold on the game based on what I played?

28:13.920 --> 28:14.920
Nah.

28:14.920 --> 28:17.000
So I ended up passing on the full version.

28:17.000 --> 28:18.000
You guys, Jamie's yelling.

28:18.000 --> 28:23.480
She bought the full version, but she is not in a mic right now, so we can't hear her.

28:23.480 --> 28:25.520
We can't hear you.

28:25.520 --> 28:27.080
Let's see.

28:27.080 --> 28:28.600
So what else did I play this week?

28:28.600 --> 28:32.160
Sadly, I didn't play Starcraft 2, although it seems like everybody's been playing that

28:32.160 --> 28:35.560
because I haven't picked it up yet.

28:35.560 --> 28:37.520
It's too much money right now.

28:37.520 --> 28:42.960
It seems to be all of it, most of you guys are talking about Starcraft 2, DC Universe.

28:42.960 --> 28:44.880
DC Universe I'm excited about.

28:44.880 --> 28:47.440
There's that new trailer out for DC Universe that looked pretty hot.

28:47.440 --> 28:49.880
Do I have to interrupt?

28:49.880 --> 28:50.880
What?

28:50.880 --> 28:54.640
Dan got Starcraft 2 and it's gorgeous and the collection edition comes with all the

28:54.640 --> 28:55.920
old versions.

28:55.920 --> 28:59.580
And we did get Hydra Thunder Hurricane, except I can't play it right now.

28:59.580 --> 29:00.580
And he loves it.

29:00.580 --> 29:01.580
But he loved the old one too.

29:01.580 --> 29:02.580
Really?

29:02.580 --> 29:03.580
I don't know.

29:03.580 --> 29:04.580
Maybe I was just in a bad mood.

29:04.580 --> 29:05.580
You'll have to see the new levels.

29:05.580 --> 29:08.560
The level in, I think it's in Turkey.

29:08.560 --> 29:11.440
That's gorgeous.

29:11.440 --> 29:12.960
There was some interesting mechanics with it.

29:12.960 --> 29:16.400
Like I didn't like hate it, but I just was, you know, there's so much other games to play

29:16.400 --> 29:19.920
right now that I wasn't like, ah, I want to drop 15 bucks on this, especially knowing

29:19.920 --> 29:21.500
that the Castlevania game's out next week.

29:21.500 --> 29:25.120
And I know I'm going to want that just based on what games I've liked historically.

29:25.120 --> 29:29.040
The problem I think with the game so far is the way you unlock, is the way that you unlock

29:29.040 --> 29:32.880
the levels because you have to keep playing and keep playing and earn credits and then

29:32.880 --> 29:35.520
you unlock the levels and it's not as cool.

29:35.520 --> 29:41.160
Um, other games I've been playing this week, uh, on the PC, I actually bought a game on

29:41.160 --> 29:43.120
Steam called Rhythm Zone.

29:43.120 --> 29:50.040
Uh, it was a $9 game that is basically Guitar Hero for your computer, but you use the keys

29:50.040 --> 29:51.040
to play.

29:51.040 --> 29:55.640
I believe you can plug in USB devices, but going to be honest, didn't really look into

29:55.640 --> 29:56.640
that.

29:56.640 --> 29:58.080
Uh, I just played it with a keyboard.

29:58.080 --> 30:01.480
The thing about the game is that yes, it has a library of songs that it comes with, but

30:01.480 --> 30:07.720
it also will make a note chart to any MP3 on your drive.

30:07.720 --> 30:12.080
As you can possibly imagine, if you've ever played one of those DDR games that makes up

30:12.080 --> 30:16.960
the steps to the music as it goes along, uh, usually the note patterns that show up kind

30:16.960 --> 30:22.120
of blow and it's just like, let's bang on random keys to my MP3 collection.

30:22.120 --> 30:24.360
That's really a more appropriate title for the game.

30:24.360 --> 30:29.280
Um, the game is just a straight up jack of Guitar Hero, really doesn't add anything new

30:29.280 --> 30:34.200
to the mix except for, ooh, I can bang random keys to my MP3s.

30:34.200 --> 30:40.480
Um, also for some inexplicable reason, the screen likes to slowly rotate to the left

30:40.480 --> 30:41.720
and to the right.

30:41.720 --> 30:45.280
I don't know why, but suddenly like, you know, you're doing, like imagine if you were playing

30:45.280 --> 30:49.000
Guitar Hero and then just suddenly the whole screen started to rotate to the left like

30:49.000 --> 30:50.520
45 degrees.

30:50.520 --> 30:55.280
You'd be like, what in the fuck, what kind of fuckery is this going on right now?

30:55.280 --> 30:57.960
And that's kind of exactly what was going on in Rhythm Zone.

30:57.960 --> 31:02.560
So um, I really didn't like it, I'm sorry to say.

31:02.560 --> 31:07.080
So I would say keep your $9 and just play more Alien Swarm, honestly.

31:07.080 --> 31:13.880
Um, as much as I love Misa music games, and I guess the one nice thing I could say about

31:13.880 --> 31:20.960
it is that it does seem like they have saved room to expand the game later on, so as long

31:20.960 --> 31:25.400
as they don't make me pay for any of those expansions, because $9 is already too much

31:25.400 --> 31:32.120
for what I got, that might be redeeming, but I'm not going to hold my breath.

31:32.120 --> 31:34.760
Yes, that's Rhythm Zone on Steam.

31:34.760 --> 31:35.760
Not a fan.

31:35.760 --> 31:36.760
Okay.

31:36.760 --> 31:42.880
Uh, let's see, that otherwise is pretty much it, especially as far as new stuff goes, didn't

31:42.880 --> 31:44.520
really play a whole lot of other new stuff.

31:44.520 --> 31:49.040
So I'm going to turn it over to Myla, have you been playing anything this week, New World?

31:49.040 --> 31:53.600
Not only am I playing, have I been playing something, but I am playing something currently,

31:53.600 --> 31:59.520
RuneScape, it's my new crack, well it's my old crack, I've been a member of this wonderful

31:59.520 --> 32:04.240
game for, wow, since 1998.

32:04.240 --> 32:06.840
We're not hearing you very well, make sure that mic's good, there you go.

32:06.840 --> 32:07.840
Is it up?

32:07.840 --> 32:08.840
Yay, yay, it's up.

32:08.840 --> 32:14.400
Um, I've been playing RuneScape since 1998, I was a member, er, not a member, but a free

32:14.400 --> 32:21.280
player back when the wilderness was PvP, what a concept, um, and then they switched it over

32:21.280 --> 32:26.160
to PvP servers, which just made a lot of us just very unhappy.

32:26.160 --> 32:31.120
Um, but then they released, about a year ago, they released the engineering skill, which

32:31.120 --> 32:36.720
is what I'm working on right now, and it just, it brings a whole new level to the game.

32:36.720 --> 32:40.480
It's, you know, originally RuneScape was, you know, something you played on the weekends

32:40.480 --> 32:44.480
when you're bored and didn't have really anything to do, and, you know, you do one skill and

32:44.480 --> 32:49.520
then you do another skill, and it's just kinda, you know, kinda monotonous kind of stuff and

32:49.520 --> 32:54.000
it's really fun and, but now that the engineering skill's out, it's amazing because you can

32:54.000 --> 33:00.040
use your regular skills that you get naturally through the game as a window into the new

33:00.040 --> 33:05.880
skill, which is great, because, um, you use your magic skill for your magic-based attacks

33:05.880 --> 33:09.240
just like you would in a regular game, but you also use your crafting skill to make new

33:09.240 --> 33:15.240
armor, and you jump into the dungeoneering levels with no equipment.

33:15.240 --> 33:21.080
You build your own equipment, you build your own things, everything that you do in the

33:21.080 --> 33:24.880
dungeoneering is based off your regular stats.

33:24.880 --> 33:30.200
And it's amazing because it really, you know, for those people like me who spent the, you

33:30.200 --> 33:37.040
know, umpteenth million plus hours of, uh, of, you know, doing the skills, it actually

33:37.040 --> 33:41.080
is a benefit because now I can, you know, waltz into a dungeon, beat a whole bunch of

33:41.080 --> 33:46.040
bad guys, level up my armor, and keep going.

33:46.040 --> 33:52.800
The only bad part I find with the skill is that when you, because it's one to four players,

33:52.800 --> 33:57.640
it's one to four player group teams, you know, like a raiding party.

33:57.640 --> 34:02.680
When you're soloing, it's a little more difficult, but you get more of the feel of the skill.

34:02.680 --> 34:07.480
When you're doing the four member parties, especially in the earlier levels, it really

34:07.480 --> 34:11.560
feels like you're just running in a dungeon, wasting everything, and keep going.

34:11.560 --> 34:16.360
You know, you're maybe at the boss for like maybe, you know, fifteen seconds.

34:16.360 --> 34:20.640
That sounds like playing a PSO back in the day.

34:20.640 --> 34:25.520
But you know, as you go down into the levels, you know, the skill increases.

34:25.520 --> 34:27.360
But therein lies the problem.

34:27.360 --> 34:34.200
Whenever you start a dungeoneering level, it takes how many people are going in, and

34:34.200 --> 34:38.280
then from there, it determines which level you start in.

34:38.280 --> 34:45.040
So if you've been soloing for a long time, you'll be at like level fourteen, and you

34:45.040 --> 34:47.960
know, the dungeons will be really harder, but if you don't do a lot of the four mans

34:47.960 --> 34:51.800
or three mans, you'll be stuck at like the first couple of levels, and you'll be going,

34:51.800 --> 34:53.000
where's the challenge?

34:53.000 --> 34:54.000
What's going on?

34:54.000 --> 34:55.000
Everything's easy!

34:55.000 --> 34:56.200
What the hell?

34:56.200 --> 35:00.080
So it's a little different, but it's really fun.

35:00.080 --> 35:01.080
It's really, really fun.

35:01.080 --> 35:02.800
Now RuneScape's been around since ninety-eight?

35:02.800 --> 35:03.800
Yes.

35:03.800 --> 35:04.800
Oh my gosh.

35:04.800 --> 35:05.800
It's been around forever.

35:05.800 --> 35:10.360
Have they done like major makeovers to it since then?

35:10.360 --> 35:16.040
It's one of those things, RuneScape, it's been slowly evolving over the years, you know.

35:16.040 --> 35:19.720
They'll release a patch here, a patch there.

35:19.720 --> 35:27.680
Dungeoneering's really the first full world patch and update that they've done in literally

35:27.680 --> 35:29.680
years.

35:29.680 --> 35:34.440
You know what's funny is that a lot of people are talking Starcraft 2 this week, and what's

35:34.440 --> 35:39.780
funny about Starcraft 2 is that it's an upgrade to a game that is about ten years old, what

35:39.780 --> 35:41.880
Starcraft 1 came out what, ninety-nine?

35:41.880 --> 35:42.880
Yeah.

35:42.880 --> 35:46.680
And there were still people playing that, well there were people still playing it today

35:46.680 --> 35:47.680
probably that haven't got the new one.

35:47.680 --> 35:48.680
But people are still playing Diablo.

35:48.680 --> 35:55.360
Oh yeah, I mean that's just as old too, so I mean, it's kind of funny to think, are you

35:55.360 --> 35:56.360
playing RuneScape right now?

35:56.360 --> 35:58.840
Yeah, I'm playing RuneScape right now and I'm just about to die.

35:58.840 --> 36:03.200
But the good news is if you die in the Dungeoneering skill, they just pop you back to the homeworld.

36:03.200 --> 36:08.680
You know, the only thing that death in Dungeoneering really accomplishes is, yes, you get a sucky

36:08.680 --> 36:09.680
score at the end.

36:09.680 --> 36:11.680
That's about all it does.

36:11.680 --> 36:16.560
Now there's some folks in chat, I see DrewNami's in chat and he's saying RuneScape with kind

36:16.560 --> 36:20.720
of one of those like, you know, whatever faces.

36:20.720 --> 36:24.420
I don't think he's a fan of RuneScape, but it's free, right?

36:24.420 --> 36:25.420
It's free.

36:25.420 --> 36:27.180
That's one of the big puzzles.

36:27.180 --> 36:28.340
Is it better than Yaris?

36:28.340 --> 36:30.000
It's got to be better than Yaris.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.000
Alright.

36:31.000 --> 36:37.320
Rob, my cat's stinky butt is better than Yaris.

36:37.320 --> 36:40.380
Tigerclaw in our chatroom says, Starcraft 2 is a huge graphical upgrade.

36:40.380 --> 36:42.160
It's no longer the pixelated graphics.

36:42.160 --> 36:43.160
Everything is all 3D graphics.

36:43.160 --> 36:44.160
Oh yeah, yeah.

36:44.160 --> 36:48.120
Oh no, all the cinematic areas are in game, are real time.

36:48.120 --> 36:52.520
No, no, and I understand that, but my point was is that, you know, RuneScape, yeah, it's

36:52.520 --> 36:55.920
from 98 and people are still playing it today, which might seem weird, but I was just saying

36:55.920 --> 37:00.560
like, Starcraft was out only one year later than that and hell, people are still playing

37:00.560 --> 37:01.560
that.

37:01.560 --> 37:03.520
I've been playing Ragnarok online since 97.

37:03.520 --> 37:06.820
Oh my, is that game really that old?

37:06.820 --> 37:07.820
Pretty old.

37:07.820 --> 37:08.820
I can double check.

37:08.820 --> 37:11.520
Because I knew it was out in Korea before that and I was playing on the Japanese servers

37:11.520 --> 37:12.520
for a little while.

37:12.520 --> 37:13.520
Interesting.

37:13.520 --> 37:18.400
And then I was playing on the open beta for IRO.

37:18.400 --> 37:19.400
Old games.

37:19.400 --> 37:20.400
Alright, Mila.

37:20.400 --> 37:21.400
Still playing it too.

37:21.400 --> 37:24.240
Anything else you want to give a shout out to in a game you released here?

37:24.240 --> 37:29.200
Well, hey Drew, other than that, nah, not really.

37:29.200 --> 37:33.080
I'm literally in the middle of a dungeon right now and I'm kind of milling through it, so.

37:33.080 --> 37:34.840
Alright, we'll try not to suck up all our bandwidth.

37:34.840 --> 37:35.840
Alright.

37:35.840 --> 37:36.840
I won't.

37:36.840 --> 37:37.840
I know.

37:37.840 --> 37:38.840
I won't.

37:38.840 --> 37:41.520
Gary, now I know you said beforehand you weren't too much of a console or, well no, now you

37:41.520 --> 37:42.920
might be a PC gamer, I'm here.

37:42.920 --> 37:48.600
Well, I used to be console, I grew up with an 8 and 16 bit Nintendo, Final Fantasy, original

37:48.600 --> 37:51.120
Final Fantasy, awesome.

37:51.120 --> 37:58.360
I have a Playstation 2 that hasn't seen much use lately, more as a DVD player than a game

37:58.360 --> 37:59.360
console.

37:59.360 --> 38:06.840
But I get back into it and I picked up a couple of computer games and I always actively look

38:06.840 --> 38:10.040
for interesting looking computer games.

38:10.040 --> 38:13.360
I'm seriously looking at Batman Arkham Asylum.

38:13.360 --> 38:15.520
That game is great.

38:15.520 --> 38:18.280
Okay, another recommendation.

38:18.280 --> 38:21.200
The reviews seem to be glowing all around, so it's probably something I'm going to have

38:21.200 --> 38:22.200
to pick up.

38:22.200 --> 38:24.600
If you like the Batman universe, it's, you know, they've got a lot of the voice actors

38:24.600 --> 38:28.520
from the animated series and, you know, it's good.

38:28.520 --> 38:35.080
Well, I'm watching the DC Universe Online trailer and it looks pretty awesome, at least

38:35.080 --> 38:36.840
what they put together here.

38:36.840 --> 38:37.880
It was very epic.

38:37.880 --> 38:39.360
I did watch that earlier this week.

38:39.360 --> 38:43.040
I'm really jazzed about DC Universe Online, I think it's going to be great.

38:43.040 --> 38:45.320
The graphics look pretty crazy and awesome.

38:45.320 --> 38:50.080
Yeah, I think my favorite part of that whole trailer was the part where Joker's about to

38:50.080 --> 38:53.160
shoot the bazooka and Harley's literally holding him on the side of the building.

38:53.160 --> 38:54.160
Yeah, I saw that.

38:54.160 --> 38:56.160
Probably trying to drag him back.

38:56.160 --> 38:57.160
Good times.

38:57.160 --> 39:02.600
If you want to comment on anything we're talking about tonight, chat.orangeloungeradio.com is

39:02.600 --> 39:07.240
the place to be or on the Game Surge Network, we are in channel Orange Lounge.

39:07.240 --> 39:08.840
We don't use the regular all games chat room.

39:08.840 --> 39:09.840
I don't know why.

39:09.840 --> 39:13.600
It's just we always had a separate room and that way when we have a separate room, we're

39:13.600 --> 39:15.680
in control and have ops and all that stuff.

39:15.680 --> 39:16.680
We're just control freaks.

39:16.680 --> 39:22.560
Alright, um, let's see, so, um, I was going to ask you about tabletop games.

39:22.560 --> 39:26.160
I know we don't talk a lot about tabletop games, but briefly, what types of tabletop

39:26.160 --> 39:27.160
games do you play?

39:27.160 --> 39:33.200
Um, Dungeons and Dragons, 4th edition, okay, okay, stop with the booze, stop with the booze.

39:33.200 --> 39:34.200
It's not bad.

39:34.200 --> 39:38.320
You can do anything, just about anything in 4th edition you can do into previous ones.

39:38.320 --> 39:41.840
I'm clueless when it comes to this stuff because I haven't played D&D in a while.

39:41.840 --> 39:46.320
Why, I played a little bit like two years ago, but that maybe lasted a month.

39:46.320 --> 39:48.920
Why are people so mad about 4th edition?

39:48.920 --> 39:51.520
Because it's a genre shift.

39:51.520 --> 39:56.720
Previous editions of D&D were high fantasy, lots of powerful spells.

39:56.720 --> 40:00.520
You got them fairly early on in your character's career.

40:00.520 --> 40:06.320
4th edition, you aren't flying until you're in the teen levels.

40:06.320 --> 40:11.880
The teleportation is line of sight, very short distances, um, but you know, that's, it's

40:11.880 --> 40:12.880
not bad.

40:12.880 --> 40:15.840
It's, you just gotta give it a try.

40:15.840 --> 40:20.040
The teleporting in previous editions, especially in 3rd, was crazy.

40:20.040 --> 40:25.000
It got to the point where a party would teleport, would scry, teleport, and kill the main boss

40:25.000 --> 40:30.320
and that was your whole campaign in the teen levels, and of course 3.5 D&D tended to break,

40:30.320 --> 40:35.800
the entire system broke around 16th to 18th level, um, because they just hadn't, it was

40:35.800 --> 40:36.800
a design thing.

40:36.800 --> 40:41.400
Yeah, what it kind of reminded me of was the difference between, you know, wow in the early

40:41.400 --> 40:45.160
levels is, you know, kind of alright, you know, you're not, you know, you don't have

40:45.160 --> 40:48.160
a lot of things, but you can still, you know, level up pretty quickly.

40:48.160 --> 40:53.120
You know, with 4th ed, it almost reminds me of the first couple levels of Final Fantasy

40:53.120 --> 40:54.120
11.

40:54.120 --> 40:56.120
Until you get to 10, you're crap.

40:56.120 --> 40:57.120
Yeah.

40:57.120 --> 41:03.360
One of the big misconceptions about 4th edition is it's, it's like a, it's an MMO on tabletop.

41:03.360 --> 41:04.960
No it's not an MMO on tabletop.

41:04.960 --> 41:08.800
Yes, they share terminology with World of Warcraft.

41:08.800 --> 41:14.640
It makes it convenient, but you can still do, this is not a ding on, on computer console

41:14.640 --> 41:18.480
games, but you can still do more because you have a living person who can keep making up

41:18.480 --> 41:19.480
the story.

41:19.480 --> 41:21.000
You're only limited by your imagination.

41:21.000 --> 41:22.000
Yes, exactly.

41:22.000 --> 41:23.000
Whereas, you know.

41:23.000 --> 41:24.880
And a good DM knows what rules to edit.

41:24.880 --> 41:25.880
That's right.

41:25.880 --> 41:29.680
Well yes, and you know, house rules in a, in a home game is the name of the game.

41:29.680 --> 41:36.520
So I mean, you can change the system to a point, if there's something that somebody

41:36.520 --> 41:37.840
wants to do.

41:37.840 --> 41:40.240
You know, it's just, it depends on what you like.

41:40.240 --> 41:43.980
I mean, people who don't like 4th edition go play Pathfinder, that's fine.

41:43.980 --> 41:44.980
No problem there.

41:44.980 --> 41:49.900
I'm glad Taizo was around to put out an alternative for the folks that didn't like the genre shift.

41:49.900 --> 41:52.680
But I enjoy 4th.

41:52.680 --> 41:58.800
I'm hoping that they'll license or put out a computer game based on the 4th edition rules

41:58.800 --> 42:04.080
but I know Wizards of the Coast was having some issues with Atari as their game publisher.

42:04.080 --> 42:07.400
I don't know if those got worked out yet or not.

42:07.400 --> 42:13.600
But I like 4th edition, I also like hero games, superheroes, champions.

42:13.600 --> 42:15.920
I play champions.

42:15.920 --> 42:19.940
Champions is fun but it's a very, very hidden numbers heavy game.

42:19.940 --> 42:26.000
I'm not a math guy so I need a character generator to keep the stuff straight but eh.

42:26.000 --> 42:33.320
You know, I haven't played the champions online MMO, I'm told it's very different in its mechanics

42:33.320 --> 42:37.800
and they just licensed, actually they bought the champions name from hero games and then

42:37.800 --> 42:39.480
licensed it back to them.

42:39.480 --> 42:40.480
It's an interesting arrangement.

42:40.480 --> 42:41.480
Ooh, amazing.

42:41.480 --> 42:48.160
Yep, I talked to Steve Long, one of the hero lead designers at length, well actually not

42:48.160 --> 42:53.880
at length briefly, at the last convention I was at, I think that was Kublai Khan or

42:53.880 --> 43:01.120
Dunder Khan in February and he explained how that worked out, it's kind of interesting.

43:01.120 --> 43:07.860
But yeah, they got 6th edition hero now is the current edition of that and I have yet

43:07.860 --> 43:12.560
to play it but I'm looking forward to doing something different than D&D very soon.

43:12.560 --> 43:17.000
I've been playing Dungeons and Dragons since 3rd edition came out, pretty much uninterrupted

43:17.000 --> 43:18.000
straight.

43:18.000 --> 43:19.000
Wow.

43:19.000 --> 43:20.000
Dedication.

43:20.000 --> 43:22.600
You kind of get tired of it after a little while.

43:22.600 --> 43:26.760
I just, it's the fantasy thing, I'm ready for a genre shift myself.

43:26.760 --> 43:29.160
I want to do a nice steampunk game.

43:29.160 --> 43:32.140
Let me get to some comments from our chatroom at chat.orangetonstrategy.com, without turning

43:32.140 --> 43:35.480
into a tabletop gaming show, although it is important, you know, a lot of computer games

43:35.480 --> 43:39.440
we play today are inspired, like champions online is a perfect example, directly inspired

43:39.440 --> 43:41.140
by the tabletop universe.

43:41.140 --> 43:43.700
Well without D&D you wouldn't have World of Warcraft.

43:43.700 --> 43:45.000
No way.

43:45.000 --> 43:46.920
Or probably even stuff like Final Fantasy.

43:46.920 --> 43:47.920
Nope.

43:47.920 --> 43:52.160
Let's see, comments from our chatroom at chat.orangetonstrategy.com, Shauran says that's not why 4th edition

43:52.160 --> 43:53.160
isn't as good.

43:53.160 --> 43:55.440
It's not as good because there's next to no customization.

43:55.440 --> 43:56.440
That's not true.

43:56.440 --> 43:57.440
Oh boy.

43:57.440 --> 43:58.440
Alright.

43:58.440 --> 44:00.440
How about we save the debate for another time.

44:00.440 --> 44:01.440
Alright, yes.

44:01.440 --> 44:04.520
Monty Boggs says, none of my group wants to spend money on the new books, so we haven't

44:04.520 --> 44:06.520
upgraded.

44:06.520 --> 44:10.500
Shauran clarified though, at least in terms of skills and multi-classing.

44:10.500 --> 44:11.500
That's also...

44:11.500 --> 44:13.500
No fan of the Flames.

44:13.500 --> 44:18.100
I will leave it at this, I still love 2nd edition for a reason.

44:18.100 --> 44:19.100
Take your THAC0 and shove it.

44:19.100 --> 44:20.100
Yes I have.

44:20.100 --> 44:22.920
Hey, I can calculate my THAC0 in my sleep, sir.

44:22.920 --> 44:26.000
THAC0 and low saving throws, high attack rolls, yes.

44:26.000 --> 44:30.400
Camara says, the 4th edition book talked down to me like I was a child.

44:30.400 --> 44:33.280
This is what the dice looks like, this is how you roll it.

44:33.280 --> 44:36.120
Yeah, that's a problem I've always had with Wizards of the Coast.

44:36.120 --> 44:38.240
They don't write very well.

44:38.240 --> 44:40.320
The game books aren't written very flavorfully.

44:40.320 --> 44:41.880
We miss you TSR.

44:41.880 --> 44:45.440
Yeah, well actually, that's one thing I like about White Wolf.

44:45.440 --> 44:51.560
At least the old World of Darkness, the vampire, the werewolf books were written very flavorfully.

44:51.560 --> 44:54.720
You actually could feel the world when you were reading it.

44:54.720 --> 44:58.320
Yeah, and then they switched to New World and there was much sighing and...

44:58.320 --> 44:59.320
We won't talk about New World.

44:59.320 --> 45:00.320
We don't talk about New World.

45:00.320 --> 45:01.320
Gnashing of teeth.

45:01.320 --> 45:03.120
We don't talk about New World of Darkness.

45:03.120 --> 45:04.840
It's a scientist left in the closet.

45:04.840 --> 45:07.320
We just made GFD happy because we're talking about New World of Darkness.

45:07.320 --> 45:11.440
I'm pleasantly surprised at what a warm reception the tabletop chat is getting from our chat

45:11.440 --> 45:12.440
room.

45:12.440 --> 45:15.520
It seems to have a tabletop corner or something in the future, I don't know.

45:15.520 --> 45:16.520
Alright.

45:16.520 --> 45:17.520
I'll do it.

45:17.520 --> 45:18.520
Yeah, TSR is dead.

45:18.520 --> 45:22.160
They died of their own money grubbing but unfortunately it looks like Wizards of the

45:22.160 --> 45:23.680
Coast might be going the same way.

45:23.680 --> 45:24.680
Eh, that's life.

45:24.680 --> 45:27.880
Alright, let's get into some housekeeping here so we can get to the video game news

45:27.880 --> 45:28.880
of the week.

45:28.880 --> 45:31.240
Housekeeping going on here at Orange Lounge Radio.

45:31.240 --> 45:35.280
I mentioned a Facebook ad campaign earlier and just to tell you guys what's going on,

45:35.280 --> 45:40.100
it doesn't really directly affect the show but we decided to try a little something something.

45:40.100 --> 45:41.600
We don't make any money doing OLR.

45:41.600 --> 45:42.960
I want to make that very clear.

45:42.960 --> 45:43.960
We don't have ads during the show.

45:43.960 --> 45:44.960
We don't have any on the site.

45:44.960 --> 45:45.960
Money?

45:45.960 --> 45:46.960
Really?

45:46.960 --> 45:47.960
I know.

45:47.960 --> 45:50.320
We don't make, we haven't for eight years made money doing OLR.

45:50.320 --> 45:55.120
So the only exception would be like donations which we, we don't actively solicit them at

45:55.120 --> 45:56.120
all.

45:56.120 --> 45:58.440
We don't have like a PayPal link or anything but you know, folks in the past have donated

45:58.440 --> 46:03.700
generously to the show and you know, that's kept us definitely going via bandwidth, time,

46:03.700 --> 46:04.700
whatever it is.

46:04.700 --> 46:06.460
Not necessarily just money.

46:06.460 --> 46:09.520
But we decided what the hell, let's take you know, ten bucks.

46:09.520 --> 46:13.660
We can find ten bucks and see what happens if we throw it into a Facebook ad campaign.

46:13.660 --> 46:17.640
And so thanks to any of you new guys we got from that.

46:17.640 --> 46:23.320
I know it, it, you know, it got us a little bit of extra exposure so we're thinking about

46:23.320 --> 46:24.720
doing more stuff like that in the future.

46:24.720 --> 46:25.720
I don't know.

46:25.720 --> 46:26.720
Exposure, exposure, exposure.

46:26.720 --> 46:28.320
We'll see.

46:28.320 --> 46:29.760
So maybe more of that in the future.

46:29.760 --> 46:30.760
I don't know.

46:30.760 --> 46:35.400
But do join our Facebook community if you're not already on there, www.facebook.com slash

46:35.400 --> 46:37.320
Orange Lounge Radio.

46:37.320 --> 46:38.320
We're also on Twitter.

46:38.320 --> 46:39.320
We'll be taking Twitter topics later.

46:39.320 --> 46:40.920
We're also on Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

46:40.920 --> 46:41.920
Alright.

46:41.920 --> 46:45.480
So, that's all I have for Housekeeping tonight.

46:45.480 --> 46:47.400
So why don't we get into some actual gaming news?

46:47.400 --> 46:48.400
Yay!

46:48.400 --> 46:53.680
We're going to start off tonight with a story on Starcraft 2.

46:53.680 --> 46:57.160
Starcraft 2 obviously is the big thing in gaming this week, although I personally have

46:57.160 --> 46:58.160
not played it.

46:58.160 --> 47:00.960
You've definitely heard some comments from chatters and Jamie watching Dan play and some

47:00.960 --> 47:01.960
other stuff.

47:01.960 --> 47:03.800
Exactly how big was Starcraft 2?

47:03.800 --> 47:11.760
Well, according to a report at vgcharts.com, Starcraft 2 sold 1.8 million copies on day

47:11.760 --> 47:12.760
one.

47:12.760 --> 47:14.760
That's not counting Korea, just so you know.

47:14.760 --> 47:15.760
That's not counting Korea?

47:15.760 --> 47:16.760
Not counting Korea.

47:16.760 --> 47:17.760
Okay.

47:17.760 --> 47:20.520
So, 1.8 million on the first day.

47:20.520 --> 47:23.200
That's Americas and Europe.

47:23.200 --> 47:27.000
Keep in mind though, I want to say, didn't World of Warcraft sell a little more?

47:27.000 --> 47:31.140
It's for, not original wow, but like Wrath of the Lich King sold what, like 2.8 I think

47:31.140 --> 47:32.140
on day one?

47:32.140 --> 47:33.140
Yeah.

47:33.140 --> 47:35.560
Do you have some other numbers for context of that?

47:35.560 --> 47:38.640
I want to say World of Warcraft Wrath of the Lich King, yeah.

47:38.640 --> 47:43.160
It's here later in the story, 2.8 million units on day one as well, and that's another

47:43.160 --> 47:44.160
Blizzard game.

47:44.160 --> 47:45.280
But here's the difference.

47:45.280 --> 47:51.800
With an MMO, especially one like wow, there's this huge need to be the first person on the

47:51.800 --> 47:54.000
server at level 80, you know what I mean?

47:54.000 --> 47:57.080
So there's a lot of people who want to go out and get it right away.

47:57.080 --> 48:00.560
Starcraft 2 I think is a little different because I don't think everybody needs to jump

48:00.560 --> 48:01.560
on board with that.

48:01.560 --> 48:05.320
You can jump in right away, but you know I was lining up, well I didn't actually, I didn't

48:05.320 --> 48:09.040
line up for Wrath of the Lich King, I just went and got it the next day.

48:09.040 --> 48:12.280
But there's a lot of people I think that are just kind of chilling with Starcraft 2, like

48:12.280 --> 48:13.280
they don't have to get it right now.

48:13.280 --> 48:14.280
Yeah.

48:14.280 --> 48:17.560
They can wait a little bit, or at least for a price drop, but then again, with Blizzard,

48:17.560 --> 48:18.560
good luck.

48:18.560 --> 48:19.560
Yeah.

48:19.560 --> 48:20.560
Good luck on that.

48:20.560 --> 48:21.560
They're still charging 20 bucks for Diablo 2.

48:21.560 --> 48:26.640
Yeah, I never heard anyone stressing over missing a raid in anything but World of Warcraft.

48:26.640 --> 48:35.240
Yeah, as far as the original Starcraft goes, I actually got my copy from a friend who actually

48:35.240 --> 48:41.100
bet me money for whether or not I could beat him at Starcraft.

48:41.100 --> 48:45.240
And I didn't know the game, so he's like, here you borrow my copy.

48:45.240 --> 48:48.800
And then I played Zerg and whipped him good, so that teaches him.

48:48.800 --> 48:53.880
I'm watching the trailer for Starcraft 2, Wings of Liberty, Ghosts of the Past.

48:53.880 --> 48:54.880
Looks intriguing.

48:54.880 --> 48:58.400
Wow, that's an interesting monster.

48:58.400 --> 48:59.960
Hurry for the Zerg.

48:59.960 --> 49:01.320
Hurry for the Zerg.

49:01.320 --> 49:05.440
I don't know how I feel about this whole splitting it up into three games, though, because really,

49:05.440 --> 49:06.760
you know, I don't know.

49:06.760 --> 49:07.760
It's...

49:07.760 --> 49:14.720
Well, even for splitting it up into three games, you know, they still gave some outrageous

49:14.720 --> 49:19.560
additions to some of the other, you know, like the Zerg, like the Protoss, you know,

49:19.560 --> 49:23.680
the exploding Zerglings I absolutely love.

49:23.680 --> 49:28.400
I don't know enough about the Starcraft universe to even profess to say, oh, this is a good

49:28.400 --> 49:33.400
idea or no, but I kind of think, like, okay, kind of going from that wow fanboy perspective

49:33.400 --> 49:36.840
of maybe these are more like expansion packs.

49:36.840 --> 49:41.400
These future releases are kind of like expansion packs in a way, but they're also standal...

49:41.400 --> 49:45.440
Because, like, I could totally just skip this game and buy the Zerg game, right?

49:45.440 --> 49:47.520
Because the next one's the Zerg game.

49:47.520 --> 49:48.520
And then I could just...

49:48.520 --> 49:49.520
Oh, the next one is the Zerg.

49:49.520 --> 49:50.840
I believe the next one's the Zerg game.

49:50.840 --> 49:53.280
And then I could just Zerg all night and all day.

49:53.280 --> 49:54.280
All day.

49:54.280 --> 49:56.440
And still do multiplayer like everyone else, right?

49:56.440 --> 49:57.440
Mm-hmm.

49:57.440 --> 49:58.440
Yeah.

49:58.440 --> 49:59.440
Interesting.

49:59.440 --> 50:00.440
Very much so.

50:00.440 --> 50:04.400
It's a strange experiment they're trying, and it's getting them a lot of crap.

50:04.400 --> 50:07.680
You know, there's a lot of people really pooping on Starcraft 2 because of the whole lack of

50:07.680 --> 50:09.480
land support, but that's...

50:09.480 --> 50:10.480
I hate to say it.

50:10.480 --> 50:12.480
I think it's more of a vocal minority than anything else.

50:12.480 --> 50:13.480
Yeah.

50:13.480 --> 50:14.880
I don't think it's anything to take.

50:14.880 --> 50:15.880
Yeah.

50:15.880 --> 50:16.880
The...

50:16.880 --> 50:20.120
Some of the, you know, looking at all the additions of what they made from the original

50:20.120 --> 50:27.400
game to the new game, it really makes each of the races a little more versatile.

50:27.400 --> 50:32.040
Because with the original Zergs, you really only had one option.

50:32.040 --> 50:33.040
Zerg Rush.

50:33.040 --> 50:34.040
That was it.

50:34.040 --> 50:42.160
That was the only way to really make a dent into the opposing sides and to really thrive

50:42.160 --> 50:43.600
was just Zerg Rush.

50:43.600 --> 50:45.560
And that was really your only tactic.

50:45.560 --> 50:53.680
With the new additions that they have, like the Explodes, Zerg lingo boom, is...

50:53.680 --> 50:59.840
It makes for a really interesting new way of playing for those people who are just used

50:59.840 --> 51:05.960
to one style for, you know, for, you know, the individuals like the Protoss, like the

51:05.960 --> 51:06.960
Terrans.

51:06.960 --> 51:10.520
Well, stepping away a little bit from the gameplay for a minute here to talk numbers

51:10.520 --> 51:14.960
again, because I think this is very interesting and could be very telling for the future.

51:14.960 --> 51:21.520
Now again, this report on VGcharts.com is estimating that 31% of those units were sold

51:21.520 --> 51:23.520
on Battle.net.

51:23.520 --> 51:29.680
Meaning that about a third was all digital distribution directly through Battle.net.

51:29.680 --> 51:31.360
That could be very...

51:31.360 --> 51:34.200
It's almost a telling sign of where GameStop's gonna be in 10 years.

51:34.200 --> 51:38.640
So do you think DVDs, games on DVD, CD are gonna be obsolete and you just download it

51:38.640 --> 51:39.640
in the future?

51:39.640 --> 51:43.400
How long do you think it's gonna take, because obviously it is gonna happen.

51:43.400 --> 51:46.320
Well, have CDs gone obsolete yet?

51:46.320 --> 51:47.320
No, not yet.

51:47.320 --> 51:50.120
They've had unexpected longevity somehow.

51:50.120 --> 51:54.160
They've been punched and kicked and throttled and had their hair pulled.

51:54.160 --> 51:55.160
Pretty much.

51:55.160 --> 51:56.160
But they're not dead yet.

51:56.160 --> 51:57.160
And I think...

51:57.160 --> 51:58.160
They're not dead yet.

51:58.160 --> 51:59.160
CDs are...

51:59.160 --> 52:00.160
They're not getting better though.

52:00.160 --> 52:04.240
CDs are kind of where, right now, I think you can kind of look to that to see a little

52:04.240 --> 52:05.720
bit about where gaming's going.

52:05.720 --> 52:08.280
Well, here's my parallel.

52:08.280 --> 52:09.640
Newspapers and online.

52:09.640 --> 52:10.840
Yes.

52:10.840 --> 52:14.880
Super circulation is down so far, so fast.

52:14.880 --> 52:16.560
Newsweek is up for sale.

52:16.560 --> 52:17.560
But they're not all dead yet.

52:17.560 --> 52:18.560
No, they're not all dead yet.

52:18.560 --> 52:22.600
And major dailies are hurting, like the Washington Post and the New York Times, but they're not

52:22.600 --> 52:23.680
gone.

52:23.680 --> 52:25.080
So we'll see what form they take.

52:25.080 --> 52:29.480
The iPad might have something to say about what form they take in the future.

52:29.480 --> 52:30.480
We'll see how that goes.

52:30.480 --> 52:32.600
Or the Amazon Kindle.

52:32.600 --> 52:34.320
The Kindle, yes.

52:34.320 --> 52:36.080
And also Sony has another e-reader.

52:36.080 --> 52:37.080
I forgot what it was called.

52:37.080 --> 52:38.760
Sony's e-reader's actually really, really nice.

52:38.760 --> 52:39.760
Okay.

52:39.760 --> 52:40.760
I've never seen it, so I don't know anything about it.

52:40.760 --> 52:42.240
One of my friends in my class has one.

52:42.240 --> 52:43.240
Okay.

52:43.240 --> 52:44.240
Which she reads books under the table during class.

52:44.240 --> 52:46.240
My mom has a Kindle and swears by it.

52:46.240 --> 52:49.720
I have the Kindle app on my iPhone, and I absolutely love it.

52:49.720 --> 52:57.760
And keep in mind, I'm trying to go into publication for my field when I'm out of school.

52:57.760 --> 53:05.080
And thankfully, there's jobs out there for online publication as well as print publications.

53:05.080 --> 53:06.480
Besides just blogging.

53:06.480 --> 53:10.920
If you know how to do them both, you're in a good place.

53:10.920 --> 53:11.920
Okay.

53:11.920 --> 53:12.920
Mm-hmm.

53:12.920 --> 53:13.920
Yeah, definitely.

53:13.920 --> 53:14.920
And I've thankfully been printed before.

53:14.920 --> 53:15.920
Yay.

53:15.920 --> 53:16.920
Ooh.

53:16.920 --> 53:17.920
Right here.

53:17.920 --> 53:18.920
La-di-da.

53:18.920 --> 53:19.920
All right.

53:19.920 --> 53:27.440
I hate to do this, but I have actually breaking news, a special report we have to go to.

53:27.440 --> 53:34.320
Live, late breaking news, you guys.

53:34.320 --> 53:35.820
Very important.

53:35.820 --> 53:38.920
There's just been a post on Facebook.

53:38.920 --> 53:41.920
Joshua Hunter was born at 5.14 PM.

53:41.920 --> 53:42.920
Yay.

53:42.920 --> 53:44.920
So congratulations to Loki.

53:44.920 --> 53:46.920
And there was much rejoicing.

53:46.920 --> 53:47.920
Yay.

53:47.920 --> 53:48.920
Congratulations.

53:48.920 --> 53:53.520
And I actually think I just saw something in the orange lounge from Kitsune.

53:53.520 --> 53:56.400
Yeah, that's how I knew to look.

53:56.400 --> 53:57.400
So yeah.

53:57.400 --> 53:59.400
Because they're able to refresh a little faster.

53:59.400 --> 54:00.400
Okay.

54:00.400 --> 54:01.400
I'm just making sure you're watching.

54:01.400 --> 54:02.400
Oh, it's so cute.

54:02.400 --> 54:03.400
I know, right?

54:03.400 --> 54:04.400
So there you go.

54:04.400 --> 54:05.400
Look at that little one.

54:05.400 --> 54:06.400
Wow.

54:06.400 --> 54:08.840
She couldn't have waited one more hour to have the baby during OLR.

54:08.840 --> 54:10.840
Now it's a Bobby Black Wolf baby.

54:10.840 --> 54:11.840
I'm sorry.

54:11.840 --> 54:12.840
Babies wait for no one.

54:12.840 --> 54:13.840
I'm kidding.

54:13.840 --> 54:20.200
I'm sure Nellie's like, get this child out of me.

54:20.200 --> 54:21.200
There it is.

54:21.200 --> 54:23.280
That's my impression of Nellie in childbirth.

54:23.280 --> 54:25.840
The baby kind of looks like Nellie.

54:25.840 --> 54:26.840
Really?

54:26.840 --> 54:27.840
Yeah.

54:27.840 --> 54:28.840
He does.

54:28.840 --> 54:32.480
I think he's got, though, you see that turn of his mouth?

54:32.480 --> 54:33.480
Yeah.

54:33.480 --> 54:34.480
That's totally Loki.

54:34.480 --> 54:35.480
You can definitely see.

54:35.480 --> 54:38.680
But he's got, I think he's got Nellie's nose.

54:38.680 --> 54:39.680
So there you go.

54:39.680 --> 54:40.680
All right.

54:40.680 --> 54:44.320
Sorry to interrupt the show, but that was definitely worth interrupting a show for.

54:44.320 --> 54:49.240
I wonder if they're going to have a bris for him, and then I feel really sorry.

54:49.240 --> 54:50.800
Final Fantasy VII victory dance.

54:50.800 --> 54:51.800
Wow, that brings back memories.

54:51.800 --> 54:52.800
I know.

54:52.800 --> 54:54.800
I should have found that music.

54:54.800 --> 54:55.800
All right.

54:55.800 --> 54:59.920
Well, any more baby news we get during the show, we'll bring to you, okay?

54:59.920 --> 55:00.920
Yay.

55:00.920 --> 55:01.920
All right.

55:01.920 --> 55:02.920
He's so pretty.

55:02.920 --> 55:03.920
And he's got red hair.

55:03.920 --> 55:04.920
Yeah.

55:04.920 --> 55:05.920
We're just glad that Starcraft didn't lay an egg.

55:05.920 --> 55:06.920
Oh.

55:06.920 --> 55:07.920
Ouch.

55:07.920 --> 55:08.920
Where's my?

55:08.920 --> 55:09.920
Yeah.

55:09.920 --> 55:10.920
Too soon.

55:10.920 --> 55:11.920
All right.

55:11.920 --> 55:12.920
Moving on.

55:12.920 --> 55:13.920
Where's my rimshot?

55:13.920 --> 55:14.920
Wow.

55:14.920 --> 55:19.320
Drew Nami's like, how long before he's eating super bacon?

55:19.320 --> 55:20.320
Too soon, you guys.

55:20.320 --> 55:21.320
Good God.

55:21.320 --> 55:22.320
Be happy for 24 hours.

55:22.320 --> 55:23.320
All right.

55:23.320 --> 55:26.720
I know Act F has a point there.

55:26.720 --> 55:28.800
It's the first, the first OLR baby.

55:28.800 --> 55:33.440
Well, I can, I can, I gave a congratulations to his sperm and Nellie's hard work.

55:33.440 --> 55:36.920
Loki and Nellie were only dating when the show started.

55:36.920 --> 55:37.920
All right.

55:37.920 --> 55:38.920
Seriously.

55:38.920 --> 55:39.920
Who did all the work?

55:39.920 --> 55:40.920
That's not, I'm not saying you're wrong.

55:40.920 --> 55:41.920
I'm not saying you're wrong.

55:41.920 --> 55:45.840
You know, I was, there's actually, there's a comedian I like called Henry Cho, who's

55:45.840 --> 55:49.000
a Korean guy from Tennessee, so he sounds totally Tennessee.

55:49.000 --> 55:53.280
I just want to remind the new listeners, last week we talked about games, the week before

55:53.280 --> 55:54.280
we had a lot of game content.

55:54.280 --> 55:55.280
Now there's a baby.

55:55.280 --> 55:57.280
Normally we talk about games, we swear.

55:57.280 --> 56:01.040
But, but I like it how he came home and the house was a mess, he asked his wife, he's

56:01.040 --> 56:02.520
like, man, the house is a mess.

56:02.520 --> 56:03.520
What'd you do?

56:03.520 --> 56:06.440
Well, let's see, today I made a lung.

56:06.440 --> 56:08.560
When you make body parts, let me know.

56:08.560 --> 56:09.560
So.

56:09.560 --> 56:11.440
All right.

56:11.440 --> 56:12.680
Can I talk Starcraft 2?

56:12.680 --> 56:13.680
Yeah.

56:13.680 --> 56:14.680
Are you sure?

56:14.680 --> 56:15.680
Go ahead.

56:15.680 --> 56:16.680
All right.

56:16.680 --> 56:20.440
Starcraft 2.

56:20.440 --> 56:25.440
One thing that is supposedly, I guess, coming to Starcraft 2 in the future, I guess it was

56:25.440 --> 56:29.660
supposed to be there when it launched, but it didn't make it, is chat rooms.

56:29.660 --> 56:30.660
That's right.

56:30.660 --> 56:32.080
You were supposed to have chat rooms in Starcraft 2.

56:32.080 --> 56:36.160
It's not there yet, but it's going to be added in a later patch, and that is per a forum

56:36.160 --> 56:40.160
post from one of the community managers over at Blizzard.

56:40.160 --> 56:44.000
The chat room is going to be, quote, based around groups where you will be able to join

56:44.000 --> 56:47.000
public channels that are based around your interests.

56:47.000 --> 56:48.320
Sounds like it's going to be like AOL.

56:48.320 --> 56:49.320
Yay.

56:49.320 --> 56:50.320
No.

56:50.320 --> 56:51.320
I'm kidding.

56:51.320 --> 56:52.480
Is that a good thing?

56:52.480 --> 56:53.800
I don't think so.

56:53.800 --> 56:57.920
There will be private chat rooms as well if you are so inclined, or you could always use

56:57.920 --> 57:02.440
real ID if you don't mind your last name being plastered all over the internet.

57:02.440 --> 57:03.440
Yay.

57:03.440 --> 57:04.440
There you go.

57:04.440 --> 57:05.440
Which is why I use an alias.

57:05.440 --> 57:06.440
There you go.

57:06.440 --> 57:10.400
I tried, but Blizzard just took it right off my credit card and was like, oh hey, this

57:10.400 --> 57:11.400
must be your name.

57:11.400 --> 57:12.400
Aw.

57:12.400 --> 57:13.400
All right.

57:13.400 --> 57:14.400
Man, I know.

57:14.400 --> 57:16.800
Anyhow, that's in the future for Starcraft 2.

57:16.800 --> 57:18.800
DarkSakura, what do you got for us?

57:18.800 --> 57:19.800
Baby.

57:19.800 --> 57:21.800
I knew this was going to happen.

57:21.800 --> 57:22.800
He's obsessed.

57:22.800 --> 57:23.800
Thank you, everybody.

57:23.800 --> 57:24.800
We'll see you next week.

57:24.800 --> 57:26.800
No, no, no, no, no, no.

57:26.800 --> 57:27.800
No, no.

57:27.800 --> 57:29.800
The little bombs started ticking really hardcore.

57:29.800 --> 57:30.800
Anyway.

57:30.800 --> 57:31.800
Aw.

57:31.800 --> 57:33.800
Did you feel a Twitter in your, or Twitter.

57:33.800 --> 57:35.800
Did you feel a Twitter in your uterus?

57:35.800 --> 57:41.240
Well, I was actually thinking of Kathy Griffin, so was it a Twitter in the twat?

57:41.240 --> 57:43.040
Oh, too soon.

57:43.040 --> 57:44.040
Ouch.

57:44.040 --> 57:45.040
Where is that rim shot?

57:45.040 --> 57:47.040
Rob's got the sad trombone.

57:47.040 --> 57:48.040
No, no, no.

57:48.040 --> 57:49.040
I got it right here.

57:49.040 --> 57:50.040
I just did.

57:50.040 --> 57:51.040
Uh.

57:51.040 --> 57:52.040
Anyway.

57:52.040 --> 57:53.040
Keep going?

57:53.040 --> 57:58.480
Anyway, remember we were talking a while back about the R4 being banned, being that that's

57:58.480 --> 58:06.040
the little memory card reader thing for the Nintendo DS so that you could play ROMs, or

58:06.040 --> 58:09.480
copies of games, or bootleg games.

58:09.480 --> 58:10.480
Um.

58:10.480 --> 58:11.480
Bootleg?

58:11.480 --> 58:17.420
So, there has, well, I've got a Ninja Pass, so I don't want to talk, but anyway, I really

58:17.420 --> 58:18.720
got it for all my imports.

58:18.720 --> 58:19.720
It's not mine, officer.

58:19.720 --> 58:20.720
I swear.

58:20.720 --> 58:28.240
But anyway, anyway, they actually, there's been released, they were banned in the UK,

58:28.240 --> 58:31.800
and now there's a bit more information that's put out about it.

58:31.800 --> 58:37.800
They basically said that it was actually related to a number of different devices that were

58:37.800 --> 58:45.800
sold by Playables, which is the company that they banned was Playables Limited.

58:45.800 --> 58:50.120
There are, the devices are defined, and this is a quote, enabled Nintendo DS users to play

58:50.120 --> 58:54.800
unlawful copies of Nintendo DS games with which they have downloaded using the internet.

58:54.800 --> 58:55.800
Ooh, naughty, naughty.

58:55.800 --> 58:58.800
That's what Nintendo means about game copiers.

58:58.800 --> 59:04.720
But the things that really make it illegal, and this is actually on the list are the R4

59:04.720 --> 59:12.520
DS, M3 DS, DS1 Supercard, DSTT, DS Linker, Ace Card, Cyclo DS, Evolution, N5, and EZ

59:12.520 --> 59:13.520
devices.

59:13.520 --> 59:14.520
You didn't mention the Ninja Pass.

59:14.520 --> 59:15.520
So all the fun stuff.

59:15.520 --> 59:16.520
They didn't mention the Ninja Pass, so I'm cool.

59:16.520 --> 59:18.520
Yeah, they always make the good stuff illegal.

59:18.520 --> 59:23.200
But all of these are ones that use the micro SD flash card.

59:23.200 --> 59:29.280
And the argument though, well basically, Nintendo's claim was that it was in violation of the

59:29.280 --> 59:34.000
Copyright Designs and Patents Act of 1998 in the UK.

59:34.000 --> 59:45.760
And the argument that Playables put up was basically that it was to play homebrew games.

59:45.760 --> 59:55.240
Basically the whole big thing is that the device circumvents Nintendo's machine.

59:55.240 --> 01:00:01.440
Any of the programming built into it that's there on purpose.

01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:06.400
And so basically, all of these things, the different encryptions, different things that

01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:13.080
Nintendo built into the hardware to protect from being able to use bootlegs and whatnot.

01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:15.040
The device is supposed to counteract them.

01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:21.160
So that's a big thing that Nintendo's got a bug up their butt about.

01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:28.240
And according to Nintendo, they've seized more than 165,000 game copiers that were intended

01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:30.640
for Playables.

01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:37.440
And so basically, that was the whole deal about it.

01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:43.820
Even though there's a bunch of other cool things you can do with them, the whole big

01:00:43.820 --> 01:00:50.240
thing has to do with circumventing their hardware.

01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:53.880
I get that and all, but doesn't this seem a little throwing out the baby with the bath

01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:55.480
water to you?

01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:57.160
No pun intended.

01:00:57.160 --> 01:01:01.440
Because this is where...

01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:05.880
They're saying that since you can use this device to pirate games, it shouldn't be out

01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:06.880
there on the market.

01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:11.880
But I can use my computer to pirate games, does that mean my computer should be banned?

01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:14.540
I mean, it's more about what you use it for.

01:01:14.540 --> 01:01:18.360
And the good thing about the R4 is that it does open it up to homebrew.

01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:20.980
Now of course, I can see both sides of it.

01:01:20.980 --> 01:01:24.440
There's a lot of people that can sit there and go, okay, you know damn well there's plenty

01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:27.360
of people that buy those R4s that aren't using it for homebrew.

01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:29.400
They are using it for the malicious purpose.

01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:30.400
So it's tough.

01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:31.400
It's like, where do you draw the line?

01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:35.460
I don't know.

01:01:35.460 --> 01:01:45.120
That's a tough call, because with the gaming community, that kind of stuff is really hard

01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:46.120
to call.

01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:54.360
Because you've got the regular honest gamers who actually buy their stuff, and they don't

01:01:54.360 --> 01:02:00.360
get access to this because just a bunch of people decided, oh, we're going to steal games.

01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:05.960
So it's not fair to both the legitimate players, as well as the guys who are doing the stuff.

01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:09.840
So it's, you know, either way, it's a bad deal.

01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:15.080
You see, if Nintendo would open up the DS to homebrew, not that I see them ever doing

01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:18.720
that, but if they were to do something like that, you know, this cart wouldn't really

01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:23.680
have a lot of leg to stand on, because its only purpose would be for something shady.

01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:28.040
But I get it, Nintendo doesn't want to open that up, because then, you know, there's going

01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:30.080
to be all sorts of scary homebrew.

01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:34.960
Well there would be homebrew to play, you know, Sony PS1 games on your DS, or something

01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:36.040
like that, you know what I mean?

01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:37.840
Which would just be horrible!

01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:40.360
I know, right?

01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:44.000
How many people originally bought a PSP to play the NES emulator that was out at the

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:45.000
time?

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:48.240
Well, I didn't buy one, but yeah.

01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:52.160
And that's another thing, like, games that strictly come out for the PSP.

01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:58.560
Like Dissidia, or Birth by Sleep.

01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:04.360
You know, both of those games that just came out for the PSP, you know, if it wasn't for

01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:07.940
emulators, most of us wouldn't be able to play those games.

01:03:07.940 --> 01:03:13.500
Because we're not going to plunker down $120 just to buy a console for a game for two games

01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:15.560
that we're going to play.

01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:17.040
It's just ridiculous.

01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:20.720
So it's part of the reason why I didn't play Kingdom Hearts Chain of Memories, is because

01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:21.720
I didn't own a DS.

01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:25.400
Yeah, but at the same time, emulators, especially to play current games, are like super duper

01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:27.720
illegal and just as bad as what they're banning.

01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:31.960
I mean, at least know what, you know, that it is what it is.

01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:37.560
Well, at least with the R4 and those devices, they are contingent on you having the system.

01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:38.560
Mm-hmm.

01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:39.560
True.

01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:40.560
Yeah.

01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:41.560
Yeah.

01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:42.560
Was there more you wanted to say there, Jamie?

01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:43.560
I thought I heard you turning it up.

01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:48.000
No, it was just quoting other cases in Europe that were, you know, had to do with reel-to-reel

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:53.000
tape copiers, but said that this was far worse because it did actually go right on the edge

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:54.160
of copyright infringement.

01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:58.480
All right, well look, if you want something for free, here's something new that's going

01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:01.640
to be for free that doesn't involve questionable legality things.

01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:03.600
This is a totally legit thing.

01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:06.680
EverQuest 2 is soon going to have a free model.

01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:07.680
What?

01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:10.880
Yeah, EverQuest 2 is getting EverQuest 2 extended.

01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:14.880
Now here's the thing though, this is not like when Lords of the Ring, or was it, yeah, Lords

01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:17.280
of the Rings opened up, no, D&D opened up to free-to-play.

01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:19.680
Maybe Lords of the Ring did too, I can't remember.

01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:23.320
Yeah, DDO opened up to win free, but there's, you know, you still have to, certain things

01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:25.960
you still have to pay for in the game, but yeah.

01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:29.440
And that's something, somewhat what's going to happen here too, but EverQuest 2 is getting

01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:36.920
a free-to-play version, so there's going to be, EverQuest 2 will still exist as it does

01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:42.920
today, but they're going to launch, kind of next door, EverQuest 2 extended, so it's kind

01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:44.920
of like a parallel universe, if you will.

01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:48.920
It's going to use a web-based application, there will be free and there will be optional

01:04:48.920 --> 01:04:53.640
paid memberships, you can buy equipment in the game, but you still get access to all

01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:58.100
the zones that you have right now, there's this whole FAQ up on the website, they do

01:04:58.100 --> 01:05:02.120
plan to launch this in mid-August, but it's interesting because they show all these different

01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:03.480
types of plans.

01:05:03.480 --> 01:05:08.120
You can get a free plan for bronze, what they call the bronze level is free, there's a silver

01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:14.280
plan that's a $10 one-time purchase that gets you more character slots, more, let's see,

01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:19.520
I'm trying to see what else, you get more spells opened up, you get more bag slots and

01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:25.400
so forth, more, you do get limits on your coins, but that goes up at the silver level,

01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:31.080
or you can pay $15 a month for the gold level, which gets you, I imagine, pretty much everything

01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:36.320
you get with EverQuest 2, or if you want, you can plunk down $200 for a full year.

01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:43.760
You've got to be really dedicated for that, but $200 across a year is $18 a month, but

01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:47.240
that's like the Uber access where you have unlimited everything.

01:05:47.240 --> 01:05:48.240
Interesting tactic.

01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:50.800
I don't know if there'll be a lot of platinum and gold players on there, because I think

01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:54.720
they would be all in regular EverQuest, but I bet you'd get a lot of bronze and maybe

01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:55.720
even some silvers.

01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:59.360
And that isn't going to cross over with the regular EverQuest 2, that's going to be its

01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:00.880
own separate thing.

01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:05.760
That's what they're saying now, but my curiosity is, well then what if one population starts

01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:09.320
to really off-balance the other, is there a possibility they might merge them later

01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:10.320
on?

01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:15.400
I was reading on this thing about if you've already got an existing subscription for EverQuest,

01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:17.280
then you basically get a gold account.

01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:21.760
Okay, that's what I figured, is that if you're already paying them $15 a month, that's probably

01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:24.320
what the regular ones are paying them.

01:06:24.320 --> 01:06:27.360
Interesting though, that not only have they launched, and maybe this is the unreported

01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:32.920
part of the story, is that not only have they launched a free, but they've also launched

01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:36.200
a pay us more version with that platinum tier.

01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:39.880
Is it more expensive than the regular games monthly subscription?

01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:43.600
I think the regular games monthly is the same as that gold, $15 a month, at least that's

01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:48.160
like the average MMO subscription, but $200 a year, I mean that's not as terrible as it

01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:54.080
sounds because you have to divide 200 by 12, so it's about what, maybe 18 a month?

01:06:54.080 --> 01:06:57.240
So it's not terrible.

01:06:57.240 --> 01:07:03.580
You know, how you were saying with the going to free to play, I, when I actually had the

01:07:03.580 --> 01:07:08.840
power on my computer to do it, I used to play this game Cartoon Network's Fusion Fall.

01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:11.240
Don't knock it till you've tried it.

01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:18.040
We're big fans of Robot Unicorn Attack here, so yeah, definitely play those games.

01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:23.360
The Cartoon Network Universe MMO, originally when it first came out, you would have the

01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:31.240
future levels, which was like about five sections of the world, and you know, a couple of quests

01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:36.280
and things like that, and then in order to go to the past, was a whole new world.

01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:43.040
It was a totally expanded world, and that was like 15 a month, and now, I think it was

01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:49.880
back in April, they went completely free to play, and they're, they literally skyrocketed

01:07:49.880 --> 01:07:53.600
their membership because they finally went free to play, because a lot of us who really

01:07:53.600 --> 01:08:03.480
enjoyed the game were pissed that it, that most of the game cost you money, because you

01:08:03.480 --> 01:08:05.880
know, me being a poor gamer, you know?

01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:09.400
I am totally against paying any sort of money for a game.

01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:11.120
Okay, within ten dollars.

01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:15.320
Well, there's a lot of people listening that are probably in the same boat you are, but

01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:21.200
there's a shout out coming here from GioVedea in our chatroom at chat.orangelandraday.com.

01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:26.680
Fusion Fall is amazing, VidPower in our chatroom says those old Cartoon Network Toonami Flash

01:08:26.680 --> 01:08:30.760
games were great, Dark Tetsuya says an Adult Swim needs an MMO.

01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:36.400
Yeah, well, Fusion Fall is close enough to an Adult Swim MMO, because the graphics of

01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:42.320
the game really remind me of this wonderful artist called Bleedman, who's on DeviantArt,

01:08:42.320 --> 01:08:45.860
and look him up, he's awesome.

01:08:45.860 --> 01:08:50.880
It's like making the cartoony, you know, like Dexter, not so cartoony, like he actually

01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:56.600
has a body, and hands, and arms, what a concept.

01:08:56.600 --> 01:08:57.600
Very cool.

01:08:57.600 --> 01:08:58.600
Yay.

01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:00.040
DarkSakura, what do you got next for us?

01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:01.880
Well, we have some other stuff.

01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:10.080
For fans of Force Unleashed, well, Force Unleashed 2 has been in development, except the executive

01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:11.080
producer quit.

01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:13.080
Oh no.

01:09:13.080 --> 01:09:18.600
Hayden Blackman resigned from LucasArts after being with them for thirteen years, and he

01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:21.460
just said it was time to go.

01:09:21.460 --> 01:09:25.360
He was like, I am not putting Jar Jar Binks in my game, F you.

01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:30.240
Well, as a quote, while the decision to leave LucasArts did not happen overnight or come

01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:35.680
easily, I really feel that now is the best time for me to move on and explore new creative

01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:39.880
challenges, and look forward to the next phase of my career, meaning, god, I hate this place,

01:09:39.880 --> 01:09:40.880
I want to quit.

01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:44.600
I know, like, totally reading through the lines, there's huge drama that went down that

01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:46.000
you're never going to know about.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:47.000
Yeah.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:52.160
And LucasArts is saying that his departure is not going to affect the game's development

01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:53.160
at all.

01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:54.160
Yeah.

01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:55.920
No, it won't affect the quality at all.

01:09:55.920 --> 01:09:56.920
No.

01:09:56.920 --> 01:09:57.920
Well, you never know.

01:09:57.920 --> 01:10:00.640
I mean, I know we're sitting here kind of poking fun, but it could get better.

01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:01.640
Who knows?

01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:04.160
And of course, you know, LucasArts left the dry.

01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:08.840
We are extremely grateful for his many contributions, fully support him in his new endeavors, and

01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:10.800
wish him all the best in the future.

01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:14.040
Because we're a company in California, and you're not allowed to say really anything

01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:19.200
bad about your previous employees, including the reasons why they left.

01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:22.280
By the way, I had a friend that worked at LucasArts, and she totally got me in the Skywalker

01:10:22.280 --> 01:10:23.280
Ranch.

01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:24.280
Whoa.

01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:25.280
You've been doing this on the show before.

01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:26.280
I'm always trying.

01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:28.600
Didn't you have George Lucas walk right by, and you said something about you want to fling

01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:29.600
your sandwich at him?

01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:32.120
I was in meatloaf-looking distance of George Lucas.

01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:34.000
I've heard this story on the show before.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:35.000
I wanted my money back.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:36.000
Thank God for your self-restraint.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
What a concept.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:43.680
Anyhow, moving on to non-Star Wars-related news, but certainly another series has a lot

01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:44.680
of fans.

01:10:44.680 --> 01:10:45.680
Halo.

01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:48.880
Of course, Halo Reach is on its way out a little later this year.

01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:52.240
What's very interesting, though, is that it was announced this week that Bungie, and this

01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:57.880
was in an interview they had with Xbox 360 achievements, the website, talking about the

01:10:57.880 --> 01:11:03.520
community director at Bungie, Brian Gerard, is saying that in Halo Reach, they're going

01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:07.280
to be doing something a little differently for you folks who like to quit your games

01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:08.280
early.

01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:11.960
Quote, I think one of the new things people will be excited about, too, is how we're going

01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:16.920
to be able to penalize people who are habitually quitting out of games, which isn't exactly

01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:21.560
cheating, but it creates a really negative experience for everybody else in the game.

01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:23.280
So they're going to penalize rage quitting?

01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:24.280
Yes.

01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:25.280
Nice.

01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:30.280
We actually have new tools now to detect that, and eventually, people who do this habitually

01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:32.780
will actually be penalized.

01:11:32.780 --> 01:11:37.680
We want to be able to remove them from the population so they can't make everyone else

01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:39.320
keep having a bad time.

01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:44.080
Now, of course, they don't elaborate on what exactly they're doing, but doesn't that sound

01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:49.160
to me like if you rage quit too much, you're going to get banished to Rage Quit Island,

01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:51.820
where you will play with nothing but other rage quitters?

01:11:51.820 --> 01:11:54.040
And not be allowed to rage quit.

01:11:54.040 --> 01:11:56.120
That sounds kind of amazing, actually.

01:11:56.120 --> 01:11:57.680
They should make them do Battle Royale.

01:11:57.680 --> 01:11:59.120
For real.

01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:02.040
But at the same time, okay, they say they're going to be able to tell the difference between

01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:03.280
a rage quit and a disconnect.

01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:04.280
Well, let me tell you this.

01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:08.740
In Final Fantasy XI, my version of rage quit was to go turn off the cable modem.

01:12:08.740 --> 01:12:14.280
So how would they know that that was, how did they know that that's me rage quitting

01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:15.280
and not a disconnect?

01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:19.040
Like, you know, I get, like, backing out of a match and all that, or quitting or whatever,

01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:24.120
but how do they know the difference between that and a legitimate drop of the connection?

01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:26.720
Well, you know those wonderful ninja mods.

01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:28.920
You never know where they are.

01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:30.680
Maybe it could be the timing of it, too.

01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:35.600
Like if you are habitually always quitting when a certain circumstance is met, then that's

01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:38.520
when you get banished to Rage Quit Island or something.

01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:43.620
Like if, hmm, you're down and you always seem to lose your connection one minute before

01:12:43.620 --> 01:12:48.000
the match is over, you're probably going to get targeted for exile, is my thought.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:51.960
Well, how do you know when somebody quits because they're, just because they're pissed

01:12:51.960 --> 01:12:54.880
and if somebody quits because they have a real emergency happening?

01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:58.160
I mean, obviously, that would be kind of rare, you'd hope, but, you know.

01:12:58.160 --> 01:13:01.800
Well, now they do use the word habitual, so you would probably have to do it more than

01:13:01.800 --> 01:13:02.800
once, for sure.

01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:03.800
Okay.

01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:04.800
Let's see.

01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:08.000
Tigerclaw says, maybe someone with high pings lagging out and disconnecting.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:12.000
Ah, maybe kind of seeing, like, oh, the pings suddenly get slower and slower.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:15.400
That's a legitimate disconnect where somebody who just had a really good connection and

01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:17.720
suddenly, oop, it's gone, maybe a little less.

01:13:17.720 --> 01:13:23.760
I'd be very curious to see how this all plays out, how they're going to treat that.

01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:26.800
But I love the idea of making all the rage quitters play together on their own little

01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:30.200
island where they can all rage quit and, you know, go after themselves.

01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:32.680
It's like trapping a bunch of trolls on a single island.

01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:33.680
Exactly.

01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:34.680
They kill each other.

01:13:34.680 --> 01:13:35.680
Wow.

01:13:35.680 --> 01:13:36.680
That's amazing.

01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:39.960
I love the idea of Xbox Live being like the continent of awesome people and then trolls

01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:41.200
banished to their own island.

01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:42.200
Sounds great to me.

01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:43.200
I wish you could do that on every single island.

01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:45.880
If they're trolls, they need to be banished to their own bridge.

01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:46.880
To go live under?

01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:50.200
As long as the bridge doesn't connect to anything, sure, I'm all for that.

01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:51.200
All right.

01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:55.480
We're going to move on to Dark Sakura with some gaming news, then we're going to get

01:13:55.480 --> 01:13:57.600
into release dates in just a little bit here.

01:13:57.600 --> 01:14:00.480
Of course, the moment Rob says that, I dropped chips on the floor.

01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:01.480
I'm sorry, Dark Sakura.

01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:03.920
Well, you didn't make me drop the chips.

01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:04.920
That's right.

01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:05.920
You're just clumsy.

01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:06.920
My hand is broken.

01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:07.920
Knock it off.

01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:08.920
She has an excuse.

01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:09.920
Use your good hand.

01:14:09.920 --> 01:14:10.920
God gave you two.

01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:13.920
I need to go take some more Vicodin.

01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:14.920
Aw.

01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:18.040
Okay, Valve made a whoops.

01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:26.440
They banned 12,000 legitimate Modern Warfare 2 players.

01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:37.240
Basically the software that's in Steamworks to get the cheaters went on an extermination

01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:43.400
rampage and banned 12,000 players over the last two weeks.

01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:46.720
Basically what happened is that, and this is a quote from the email that was sent out

01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:52.120
by Gabe Newell, who's the Valve president, the problem was that Steam would fail a signature

01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:58.400
check between the disk version of a DLL and a latent memory version.

01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:02.520
So basically they said, you know, our bad, sorry.

01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:03.520
Whoops.

01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:04.520
I like that he's angst.

01:15:04.520 --> 01:15:06.800
I apologize for any frustration or angst at me that's caused you.

01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:08.240
Haven't I ever seen angst in a professional shooter?

01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:10.200
Can you all turn your caps lock off now?

01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:11.440
I know, right?

01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:20.800
So he's also promised a giftable copy of Left 4 Dead 2 to all of those affected, as well

01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:23.480
as a copy for themselves.

01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:27.640
So if I get accidentally banned from a Steam game, I'm going to get two free copies of

01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:29.000
a game.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:30.000
One is giftable.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:31.000
Right.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:32.880
That's basically two free copies, right?

01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:34.680
One for you and one for someone you really like.

01:15:34.680 --> 01:15:35.680
Yeah.

01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:38.600
So hey, any of you that's been affected by this, gimme.

01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:39.600
Right?

01:15:39.600 --> 01:15:45.000
That's kind of where I'm at too, I'm like, you know, I have Left 4 Dead 1, but not 2.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:51.560
Well, I think why they're giving Left 4 Dead 2 out is because, you know, when you get banned

01:15:51.560 --> 01:15:56.360
from a game like Modern Warfare 2, you know, the only compensation you can get is to go

01:15:56.360 --> 01:15:59.320
around kiddling a bunch of zombies is compensation, you know?

01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:01.000
It's a fair trade.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.760
Well also, playing a big hairy biker.

01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:04.760
Exactly.

01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:09.560
Besides the also obvious part that it's also their game, you know, it is Val's game.

01:16:09.560 --> 01:16:11.620
It's kind of one that they can give away.

01:16:11.620 --> 01:16:16.800
It actually is kind of impressive that they instead didn't go, oh, well, whoops, we'll

01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:22.100
give you a copy of what's what's what's cheaper Left 4 Dead 1, you know, or something magical

01:16:22.100 --> 01:16:23.100
unicorn fart.

01:16:23.100 --> 01:16:24.100
Yeah, exactly.

01:16:24.100 --> 01:16:25.100
Magical.

01:16:25.100 --> 01:16:26.100
Well, I don't think that was a valve game.

01:16:26.100 --> 01:16:29.480
So you can have a free copy of Alien Swarm.

01:16:29.480 --> 01:16:32.280
Yeah, Alien Swarm.

01:16:32.280 --> 01:16:34.680
Oh, wait, everybody's getting that free.

01:16:34.680 --> 01:16:39.040
So have we talked already about the wonderfulness that is Portal 2?

01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:43.880
Uh, on this show we have, but did you watch all the, um, while I'm firing up release dates?

01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:44.880
Tech demonstrations?

01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:45.880
Wow!

01:16:45.880 --> 01:16:47.120
I know, right?

01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:49.120
I love the slippery thing.

01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:50.120
The what?

01:16:50.120 --> 01:16:51.120
The slippery goo?

01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:52.120
Yes, the goo.

01:16:52.120 --> 01:16:53.120
I love the goo.

01:16:53.120 --> 01:16:54.120
And the bouncy goo?

01:16:54.120 --> 01:16:55.120
I love the bouncy goo.

01:16:55.120 --> 01:16:56.120
That was so great.

01:16:56.120 --> 01:17:00.080
I was I was very much pleased with with the entire concept of Portal.

01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:05.400
Um, you know, the fact that they changed the the, oh, and I died.

01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:06.400
Oh, well.

01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:07.400
Are you still playing RuneScape?

01:17:07.400 --> 01:17:08.400
Yes, I'm still playing RuneScape.

01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:09.400
I'm still playing RuneScape.

01:17:09.400 --> 01:17:10.400
The zombie just killed me.

01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:12.400
You're worse than Loki in Magic Robot Unicorn.

01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:13.720
He plays Magic Robot Unicorn.

01:17:13.720 --> 01:17:16.560
He denies that he does it too, but he does.

01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:21.320
But um, but yeah, I the only, you know, grief I kind of have was the fact that they're using

01:17:21.320 --> 01:17:24.720
the, they're theoretically using the same protagonist, but she looks nothing like the

01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:25.720
original game.

01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:27.280
Did they put a picture of her?

01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:30.700
Um, they did, but they didn't.

01:17:30.700 --> 01:17:32.800
It's like, um, they had in the picture of her.

01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:37.120
Well, I saw the one that was in Game Informer, um, the different, uh,

01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:40.320
Well, you know, she's also supposed to be, the actual person is supposed to be showing

01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:42.920
up in, um, Half Life 3.

01:17:42.920 --> 01:17:46.200
We also might've set off an LOL, Accidental False Alarm in chat.

01:17:46.200 --> 01:17:48.160
Uh, Thamster says, wait, is that out now?

01:17:48.160 --> 01:17:49.160
No, no, no, no, it's not.

01:17:49.160 --> 01:17:51.160
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:17:51.160 --> 01:17:52.160
That's a 2011.

01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:54.000
No, no, no, no, nope.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:57.000
But there are some sexy demos on YouTube if you want to go check it out.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:00.480
Uh, let's go to release dates, travel around the world and talk about games that are going

01:18:00.480 --> 01:18:01.480
to be coming out.

01:18:01.480 --> 01:18:02.480
Yeah.

01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:05.020
Portal 2 will not be on the list this week, but maybe some other stuff.

01:18:05.020 --> 01:18:06.680
So I'm going to start with the US tonight.

01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:09.080
We're going to shake things up a little bit because obviously Loki's not here.

01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:12.800
So I'm going to cover US tonight and, uh, pronounce things correctly for once.

01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:13.800
I hope.

01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:16.080
Uh, Monster Rancher DS is out this week.

01:18:16.080 --> 01:18:18.900
It's going to cost you 30 bucks if you want that on the DS.

01:18:18.900 --> 01:18:19.900
Sing it.

01:18:19.900 --> 01:18:20.900
Family Hits.

01:18:20.900 --> 01:18:21.900
That's right.

01:18:21.900 --> 01:18:24.360
Cause you know, you want to sing songs from Beauty and the Beast and the Little Mermaid

01:18:24.360 --> 01:18:29.000
all from Disney coming out on the DS and I'm sorry, the PlayStation three and the Wii

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:30.440
this week.

01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:32.240
You know what's interesting though?

01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:33.720
The PS3 one is cheaper.

01:18:33.720 --> 01:18:35.600
Oh, because the Wii one comes with the mic.

01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:36.760
I get it.

01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:40.560
Uh, Gary, I know this, this is going to be the one to get you back into console games.

01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:41.560
You ready?

01:18:41.560 --> 01:18:42.560
Dora the Explorer.

01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:44.560
Dora's big first adventure on the DS.

01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:45.560
Oh, whatever.

01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:46.560
30 bucks.

01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:47.560
Oh no.

01:18:47.560 --> 01:18:48.560
I know.

01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:51.120
If I wanted to get another console, I'd get a PS3.

01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:52.120
No.

01:18:52.120 --> 01:18:55.640
Junior classic books and fairy tales, $20 on the Nintendo DS.

01:18:55.640 --> 01:18:59.880
This is basically you're paying for 130 bucks that are pretty much in the public domain

01:18:59.880 --> 01:19:03.620
or were really cheap to license, but if you want that, hey, have fun with it.

01:19:03.620 --> 01:19:08.280
So, uh, uh, quite a barrage of some more wireless controllers and accessories also out this

01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:09.280
week.

01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:12.560
And, uh, I think we might've hit on most of the games.

01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:13.560
Yeah.

01:19:13.560 --> 01:19:16.480
I think it's kind of a slow week in game release world.

01:19:16.480 --> 01:19:18.760
I'm trying to see if there's anything else this week.

01:19:18.760 --> 01:19:20.280
Well, there's nothing in the budget.

01:19:20.280 --> 01:19:22.480
They got anything good in the budget Ben?

01:19:22.480 --> 01:19:26.720
Uh, well, this new game on the Xbox 360 is only $30.

01:19:26.720 --> 01:19:27.720
It's a role playing game.

01:19:27.720 --> 01:19:32.440
And for an Xbox 360 game, that's something it's a auger rest war and it's comes out on

01:19:32.440 --> 01:19:39.560
the fifth record of auger rest record of auger rest war familiar, like a certain, uh, war.

01:19:39.560 --> 01:19:40.560
Yeah.

01:19:40.560 --> 01:19:41.560
Yeah.

01:19:41.560 --> 01:19:42.560
Could be inspired.

01:19:42.560 --> 01:19:46.960
I was going to tell you record of us were started off from a Japanese tabletop game.

01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:47.960
Yeah.

01:19:47.960 --> 01:19:48.960
Yeah.

01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:49.960
I knew that.

01:19:49.960 --> 01:19:53.680
And if I had a bootleg of the legend of Kristinia, which was supposed to be like the original

01:19:53.680 --> 01:19:59.240
sequel and they showed a bunch of guys at the convention playing it, why am I not surprised?

01:19:59.240 --> 01:20:00.440
That's all I have for the U S this week.

01:20:00.440 --> 01:20:04.040
Well, like I said, the UK is looking pretty bare, nothing until next week.

01:20:04.040 --> 01:20:05.600
So I'm going to do Japan.

01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:06.600
Yay.

01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:10.360
Sorry to take your pronunciation away from you, Rob.

01:20:10.360 --> 01:20:11.360
It's really fine.

01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:13.840
Put all that anime pronunciation skill to the test.

01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:18.440
Well, um, we've got a few things that don't really particularly have a date on it, but

01:20:18.440 --> 01:20:19.440
they're for PC and Mac.

01:21:23.640 --> 01:21:24.640
I said that.

01:21:24.640 --> 01:21:25.640
Oh, good.

01:21:25.640 --> 01:21:26.640
Okay.

01:21:26.640 --> 01:21:27.960
Well, you know, I just read too fast.

01:21:27.960 --> 01:21:33.880
And then we have Mamegoma Kawaii Gaibai, um, oh no, I'm thinking Oppai, Oppai means boobs.

01:21:33.880 --> 01:21:37.080
Um, Tetris party premium also on, um, August 5th.

01:21:37.080 --> 01:21:38.960
Wait, there's a game about boobs coming out?

01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:42.120
No, it's Ipai and I thought I was thinking Oppai, which is.

01:21:42.120 --> 01:21:43.120
Surprises you.

01:21:43.120 --> 01:21:44.120
Yeah.

And then Shin Sangokumusou four empires, which is also a re-release, of course, Madden NFL

01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:06.360
11 is also on the list, so the persona games were really good.

01:22:06.360 --> 01:22:07.360
I really liked them.

01:22:07.360 --> 01:22:08.360
Believe it or not.

01:22:08.360 --> 01:22:11.240
We have sports fans that listen to the show who want their roster update for the year.

01:22:11.240 --> 01:22:15.800
Just like DDR fans with their song, like who in Japan likes American football anyway, on

01:22:15.800 --> 01:22:20.280
the way we have Tetris party premium and twinkle queen.

01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:23.880
Also, um, arcade shooter, twinkle queen, let me look this up.

01:22:23.880 --> 01:22:26.160
I think I met a drag queen like that once.

01:22:26.160 --> 01:22:27.160
Ooh.

01:22:27.160 --> 01:22:28.160
It looks pretty.

01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:30.120
Isn't that a game right up your alley?

01:22:30.120 --> 01:22:32.120
No, I'm looking at screen captures of it.

01:22:32.120 --> 01:22:33.120
Oh, it's a fighting game.

01:22:33.120 --> 01:22:34.680
Oh, it's an all girl fighting game.

01:22:34.680 --> 01:22:35.680
Oh, sweet.

01:22:35.680 --> 01:22:36.680
Oh, wow.

01:22:36.680 --> 01:22:37.680
You have my attention.

01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:40.720
Sort of like the OSCO 120% back in the day.

01:22:40.720 --> 01:22:41.760
Been there, done that.

01:22:41.760 --> 01:22:44.800
How many all chick fighting games have we seen at this point?

01:22:44.800 --> 01:22:48.560
Anyway, they are not going to sleep with you when you beat the game, just so you know.

01:22:48.560 --> 01:22:53.360
A few, um, um, you know, undated things that I just think is funny is gun blade, New York

01:22:53.360 --> 01:22:56.600
and LA machine guns arcade pack, which I would totally get.

01:22:56.600 --> 01:22:57.600
Love you.

01:22:57.600 --> 01:23:03.800
Sega, um, colds, gym, dance, workout, and I know, right.

01:23:03.800 --> 01:23:07.520
And Lucha Libre, triple a heroes, Dell ring.

01:23:07.520 --> 01:23:14.120
And um, that was the one they were plugging at, uh, E3 and Disney guilty party.

01:23:14.120 --> 01:23:17.640
I know what game that is, but that's just a funny way of phrasing it.

01:23:17.640 --> 01:23:19.360
That Disney guilty party.

01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:23.920
Who's guilty of stealing the cookies that like clue and it kind of is like a who done

01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:24.920
a game.

01:23:24.920 --> 01:23:25.920
There were so many characters.

01:23:25.920 --> 01:23:28.200
The only thing, uh, it's like an original Disney game.

01:23:28.200 --> 01:23:31.560
It's not like Ariel and beauty of the beast and stuff.

01:23:31.560 --> 01:23:35.360
The only Disney game that I'm actually looking forward to that they were, um, that they were

01:23:35.360 --> 01:23:39.160
plugging in E3 really, really bad was Epic Mickey.

01:23:39.160 --> 01:23:40.160
That looks amazing.

01:23:40.160 --> 01:23:45.720
Epic Mickey does look Epic, but I got to give a shout out to Tron because I don't stand

01:23:45.720 --> 01:23:51.160
for movies very often, but I will be there day one Tron 3D and I'm going to have the

01:23:51.160 --> 01:23:53.320
biggest fanboy boner in the galaxy.

01:23:53.320 --> 01:23:54.320
Oh yeah.

01:23:54.320 --> 01:23:55.320
Gamers unite!

01:23:55.320 --> 01:23:59.640
We'll have to just have a party of it, then you know they're going to sell so many tie

01:23:59.640 --> 01:24:00.640
in games with that.

01:24:00.640 --> 01:24:01.640
It's going to be ridiculous.

01:24:01.640 --> 01:24:02.640
If it's a good movie.

01:24:02.640 --> 01:24:05.640
I had a light second game on my phone.

01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:06.640
Yeah.

01:24:06.640 --> 01:24:11.900
Anyway, back to the Japanese list, um, PlayStation 3, Assassin's Creed II special edition and

01:24:11.900 --> 01:24:15.840
Tiger Woods PGA Tour 11, why?

01:24:15.840 --> 01:24:20.760
And then finally for Xbox 360 we have Assassin's Creed II special edition platinum collection.

01:24:20.760 --> 01:24:25.200
Magna Carta 2, which I know is pretty big, and it's a platinum collection, and that would

01:24:25.200 --> 01:24:26.200
be all.

01:24:26.200 --> 01:24:27.200
That's everything.

01:24:27.200 --> 01:24:29.840
A lot of those were budget-binned games or re-releases, which I really like.

01:24:29.840 --> 01:24:31.240
Yeah, Magna Carta 2 is a re-release.

01:24:31.240 --> 01:24:34.740
Yeah, Japan seems to be doing a lot of price reductions this time of year.

01:24:34.740 --> 01:24:37.880
Don't know what the occasion is, but hey, I'll take any excuse.

01:24:37.880 --> 01:24:39.280
Yeah, so will I.

01:24:39.280 --> 01:24:43.600
Yeah, somebody's got some serious rage against Mickey on the chat room.

01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:45.360
That would actually be Drunami.

01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:49.560
Some folks in our chat room are asking, uh, where is, where was it here, I'm going back

01:24:49.560 --> 01:24:53.400
to our chat room, chat.orangelaungeradio.com, and I think the whole twinkle queen brought

01:24:53.400 --> 01:24:54.400
this up.

01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:57.480
Frisbee's asking, where the fuck is the RuPaul's Drag Race game?

01:24:57.480 --> 01:25:02.320
I think we talked about that on a previous edition of OLR.

01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:06.960
Frisbee is saying, or RuPaul's Mario Kart slash Diddy Kong Racing, I really do want

01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:09.320
RuPaul to have a video game of some sort.

01:25:09.320 --> 01:25:13.340
Like if Project Runway can have a freaking game, or what, The Bachelor had a game come

01:25:13.340 --> 01:25:17.040
out last week or this week or something, I mean, come on.

01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:18.640
This bitch needs a game.

01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:19.640
Exactly.

01:25:19.640 --> 01:25:20.640
Come on.

01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:21.640
Exactly.

01:25:21.640 --> 01:25:25.100
Who would, I mean, come on chat room, which would you rather play?

01:25:25.100 --> 01:25:29.480
The Bachelor or RuPaul's Drag Race?

01:25:29.480 --> 01:25:35.680
Even, look, even you guys who have no interest in drag whatsoever, completely secure your

01:25:35.680 --> 01:25:40.120
masculinity and your love of women, I think you would play RuPaul's Drag Race versus The

01:25:40.120 --> 01:25:41.120
Bachelor.

01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:42.120
Absolutely.

01:25:42.120 --> 01:25:43.120
And why do you say this?

01:25:43.120 --> 01:25:44.120
Because it's awesome.

01:25:44.120 --> 01:25:46.560
Because The Bachelor is gayer than RuPaul's Drag Race.

01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:47.560
It really is.

01:25:47.560 --> 01:25:48.560
I won't argue with that.

01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:49.560
You know what?

01:25:49.560 --> 01:25:50.560
Okay.

01:25:50.560 --> 01:25:51.560
This is my thing.

01:25:51.560 --> 01:25:57.960
Is it when I saw, when I see my husband spend hours customizing wrestling characters, like

01:25:57.960 --> 01:25:58.960
they're dressed up dolls.

01:25:58.960 --> 01:25:59.960
It's Barbie.

01:25:59.960 --> 01:26:00.960
Yeah.

01:26:00.960 --> 01:26:01.960
It's Barbie for men.

01:26:01.960 --> 01:26:02.960
I was like, yeah, men really like to do this too.

01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:05.560
Well, wrestling is just soap opera for men.

01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:06.920
There's nothing wrong with that.

01:26:06.920 --> 01:26:07.920
Men need their stories.

01:26:07.920 --> 01:26:08.920
Very bad soap opera.

01:26:08.920 --> 01:26:11.080
I loved it.

01:26:11.080 --> 01:26:16.820
And speaking of the whole rage quitting thing for Halo, I just rage created RuneScape because

01:26:16.820 --> 01:26:17.820
I was sick of dying.

01:26:17.820 --> 01:26:18.820
I died twice.

01:26:18.820 --> 01:26:21.840
You need to get banished to a rage quit island.

01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:25.960
Oh, actually, don't get me started on the fact that, you know, I started the game day

01:26:25.960 --> 01:26:32.220
one in RuneScape, you know, had to fend for myself, had to learn how to use all my skills

01:26:32.220 --> 01:26:36.680
on my own, then about, you know, two years after I started playing, they introduced New

01:26:36.680 --> 01:26:37.680
Byland.

01:26:37.680 --> 01:26:38.680
Oi!

01:26:38.680 --> 01:26:39.680
New Byland.

01:26:39.680 --> 01:26:40.680
They basically show you-

01:26:40.680 --> 01:26:42.280
There really is a place called New Byland.

01:26:42.280 --> 01:26:43.280
Yeah.

01:26:43.280 --> 01:26:46.560
They basically show you how to get to fifth level.

01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:50.480
They walk you through it tutorial style on how to crab-

01:26:50.480 --> 01:26:52.200
The little hand come out of the monitor.

01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:53.200
Exactly.

01:26:53.200 --> 01:26:54.200
Come with me.

01:26:54.200 --> 01:26:56.720
It's like that stupid Milo thing they were showing at E3 last year.

01:26:56.720 --> 01:26:57.720
Like come with me.

01:26:57.720 --> 01:26:58.720
Yeah.

01:26:58.720 --> 01:27:00.800
They were probably gonna listen to many of those people.

01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:03.920
It reminded me of that annoying paperclip guy on Word.

01:27:03.920 --> 01:27:04.920
Oh, God.

01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:06.360
Let me turn the thing off.

01:27:06.360 --> 01:27:08.580
I just caught a pepper in my wound.

01:27:08.580 --> 01:27:13.600
Every work computer I ever log into for the first time, I'm always like, okay, first thing's

01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:14.600
first.

01:27:14.600 --> 01:27:15.600
Launch Word.

01:27:15.600 --> 01:27:16.600
Kill that office assistant.

01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:17.600
Right click, disable.

01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:18.600
Kill the paperclip.

01:27:18.600 --> 01:27:19.600
Euthanize the paperclip.

01:27:19.600 --> 01:27:21.500
Or the wizard or whatever form it happens to take.

01:27:21.500 --> 01:27:23.500
That thing is so bloody annoying.

01:27:23.500 --> 01:27:28.640
Do you know how many people I've seen in my professional career that like to have Mr.

01:27:28.640 --> 01:27:32.800
Paperclip up all day long, but they don't like, you know how in Word you can actually

01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:33.800
change it.

01:27:33.800 --> 01:27:34.800
So you can change it.

01:27:34.800 --> 01:27:35.800
Clippy.

01:27:35.800 --> 01:27:36.800
That's what it's name was.

01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:37.800
You have Clippy, but you also have the little kitty.

01:27:37.800 --> 01:27:38.800
Yeah.

01:27:38.800 --> 01:27:42.440
And I can't tell you how many I've seen that just like to leave the cat up on their desk

01:27:42.440 --> 01:27:48.320
all day, like a little virtual Tamagotchi kitty pet running around their desktop.

01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:54.460
And I'm like, but hey, look, I'm all about whatever makes you happy, but at the same

01:27:54.460 --> 01:27:58.400
time don't complain about your system being slow when you have Miss Kitty running around

01:27:58.400 --> 01:27:59.400
chasing yarn.

01:27:59.400 --> 01:28:00.400
Yep.

01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:01.400
Yep.

01:28:01.400 --> 01:28:02.400
Yes.

01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:03.400
Clippy must die.

01:28:03.400 --> 01:28:04.400
My word for the whole thing is why?

01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:05.400
Because not a question.

01:28:05.400 --> 01:28:06.400
Because they need their hands held.

01:28:06.400 --> 01:28:07.400
Not a question.

01:28:07.400 --> 01:28:08.400
Just why.

01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:09.400
Hold on.

01:28:09.400 --> 01:28:11.640
Dark Tetsuya is making the project journey game for OLR, right?

01:28:11.640 --> 01:28:15.320
Can we have a level where like Dark Sakura shoots paperclips?

01:28:15.320 --> 01:28:17.880
I think that would be appropriate.

01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:19.240
She can euthanize Mr. Paperclip.

01:28:19.240 --> 01:28:20.860
That would be great.

01:28:20.860 --> 01:28:21.860
Just making that request.

01:28:21.860 --> 01:28:22.860
That's not gory enough.

01:28:22.860 --> 01:28:23.860
That guy needs to die horribly.

01:28:23.860 --> 01:28:27.880
Well, then a paperclip can just attack her hand if she loses.

01:28:27.880 --> 01:28:32.800
Rob, the giant paperclip, but when you shoot him, he leads kittens.

01:28:32.800 --> 01:28:38.600
I was thinking just Mr. Paperclip could melt into slag slowly and painfully, but okay,

01:28:38.600 --> 01:28:39.600
fine.

01:28:39.600 --> 01:28:40.600
Okay.

01:28:40.600 --> 01:28:42.320
Well, Rob, can I do a story?

01:28:42.320 --> 01:28:43.320
Yes, you may.

01:28:43.320 --> 01:28:44.320
Okay.

01:28:44.320 --> 01:28:45.320
Guess what?

01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:46.320
What?

01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:48.680
Disney acquired Playdom.

01:28:48.680 --> 01:28:49.680
What does that mean?

01:28:49.680 --> 01:28:52.360
Well, Playdom does sorority life, Rob.

01:28:52.360 --> 01:28:54.480
My favorite Facebook game.

01:28:54.480 --> 01:28:56.640
I so quit that really fast.

01:28:56.640 --> 01:28:57.640
What?

01:28:57.640 --> 01:29:03.160
I played, I seriously played sorority life religiously for like a month and then I got,

01:29:03.160 --> 01:29:04.160
don't judge me.

01:29:04.160 --> 01:29:06.520
I see you judging him.

01:29:06.520 --> 01:29:08.680
You totally were just judging me right there.

01:29:08.680 --> 01:29:09.680
Did you see that look?

01:29:09.680 --> 01:29:10.680
That was the look of judgment.

01:29:10.680 --> 01:29:11.680
He was judging.

01:29:11.680 --> 01:29:12.680
Chips.

01:29:12.680 --> 01:29:13.680
That's right.

01:29:13.680 --> 01:29:14.680
Oh.

01:29:14.680 --> 01:29:16.760
I need to grab the chips because this is just entertaining now.

01:29:16.760 --> 01:29:20.400
I was playing, look, but do you know why I was playing sorority life?

01:29:20.400 --> 01:29:25.680
Because there was a dress up character mode and I was the fiercest diva on the block.

01:29:25.680 --> 01:29:26.680
I was.

01:29:26.680 --> 01:29:27.680
I got nothing.

01:29:27.680 --> 01:29:28.680
I got nothing.

01:29:28.680 --> 01:29:32.560
And uh, she would, she would beat bitches down with her purse cause that's just sorority

01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:33.560
life.

01:29:33.560 --> 01:29:35.920
But here's what started frustrating me about sorority life.

01:29:35.920 --> 01:29:40.200
They implemented, and I cannot believe we are giving this any FaceTime on the show,

01:29:40.200 --> 01:29:43.080
but I really want to reiterate this week.

01:29:43.080 --> 01:29:44.080
I don't give a fuck.

01:29:44.080 --> 01:29:45.080
All right.

01:29:45.080 --> 01:29:46.080
All right.

01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:48.000
So anyway, so sorority life.

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.160
Whatever floats your boat, man.

01:29:50.160 --> 01:29:51.160
Whatever sinks your battleship.

01:29:51.160 --> 01:29:53.040
Yes, that too.

01:29:53.040 --> 01:29:54.040
Sorority life.

01:29:54.040 --> 01:29:58.520
I, I played it for like a month and uh, I quit finally because I got really irritated

01:29:58.520 --> 01:30:03.760
that whenever you log in, for some reason it would instantly put you up to the top of

01:30:03.760 --> 01:30:07.120
other people's list of who wants to beat down this bitch.

01:30:07.120 --> 01:30:10.680
And so like I would log in and within three seconds I would be out of energy because I

01:30:10.680 --> 01:30:14.800
would basically get gang raped by all these blonde bitches the minute I log in.

01:30:14.800 --> 01:30:19.540
So sorority life needed to give me at least like two minutes to bank my money or something,

01:30:19.540 --> 01:30:20.540
but I didn't do that.

01:30:20.540 --> 01:30:23.600
And that's my complaint with sorority life and I've totally wasted two minutes of your

01:30:23.600 --> 01:30:24.600
life.

01:30:24.600 --> 01:30:25.600
You're never going to get back.

01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:27.280
Can I, can I keep going?

01:30:27.280 --> 01:30:28.280
Yes.

01:30:28.280 --> 01:30:32.840
Well play them also uses, um, social city also has, sorry, social city and market street.

01:30:32.840 --> 01:30:38.600
You know, those are their other kind of big ones, but um, but Disney, Disney acquired

01:30:38.600 --> 01:30:39.600
them.

01:30:39.600 --> 01:30:45.600
It, it now has sorority life, so maybe we'll get, you know, princess sorority life.

01:30:45.600 --> 01:30:46.840
Now that would bring me back.

01:30:46.840 --> 01:30:47.840
I would play that.

01:30:47.840 --> 01:30:48.840
Okay.

01:30:48.840 --> 01:30:49.840
Just real quick.

01:30:49.840 --> 01:30:51.800
I would like to see Belle give everyone the smack down.

01:30:51.800 --> 01:30:53.640
She's the brainy woman.

01:30:53.640 --> 01:30:58.280
Tiana being the new girl on the block is not old and aged like Belle, so she will beat

01:30:58.280 --> 01:30:59.280
you all down.

01:30:59.280 --> 01:31:01.000
There's Jasmine who probably has her whole.

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:02.360
Jasmine will just whine.

01:31:02.360 --> 01:31:06.960
She'll just, you know, sic her tiger on people.

01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:08.200
I want to have a tiger.

01:31:08.200 --> 01:31:11.400
I want to be a princess with a tiger, Rob, not with a frog.

01:31:11.400 --> 01:31:13.600
I thought you wanted a princess with a pony.

01:31:13.600 --> 01:31:17.400
No tiger or a goat.

01:31:17.400 --> 01:31:18.400
Wow.

01:31:18.400 --> 01:31:25.280
Yeah, I'm, I'm officially decreeing the, the wah wah sound to SSJ Matt for a Facebook game,

01:31:25.280 --> 01:31:26.720
getting FaceTime on the show.

01:31:26.720 --> 01:31:27.720
Who would have thunk it?

01:31:27.720 --> 01:31:28.720
Yeah.

01:31:28.720 --> 01:31:29.720
He gets the wah wah sound.

01:31:29.720 --> 01:31:30.720
I see what you did there.

01:31:30.720 --> 01:31:33.280
I've, I've, um, I've bitched about how much I hate Farmville.

01:31:33.280 --> 01:31:34.280
Oh God.

01:31:34.280 --> 01:31:36.720
Don't get me started.

01:31:36.720 --> 01:31:40.200
I'm playing hotel city and I actually like it.

01:31:40.200 --> 01:31:42.720
You say that like it's supposed to make it better.

01:31:42.720 --> 01:31:43.720
Like it's okay.

01:31:43.720 --> 01:31:44.720
All right.

01:31:44.720 --> 01:31:45.720
Anyhow.

01:31:45.720 --> 01:31:48.160
Uh, hey, now how about a real game?

01:31:48.160 --> 01:31:49.160
I like this.

01:31:49.160 --> 01:31:50.160
This is awesome.

01:31:50.160 --> 01:31:55.680
This game is called, there's an old school game, pengo K pengo was, let me see if I can

01:31:55.680 --> 01:31:58.840
find some music from pengo cause pink pengo was pretty Epic.

01:31:58.840 --> 01:32:03.200
Uh, back in the day it was this game where you would play a penguin and you walked around,

01:32:03.200 --> 01:32:09.040
um, a maze and you could push ice blocks freaking hard too, but it's a lot of fun.

01:32:09.040 --> 01:32:11.640
I don't, I don't remember what it's inspired by, but let's see.

01:32:11.640 --> 01:32:18.080
Here's a, here's some of pengo.

01:32:18.080 --> 01:32:26.520
So yeah, then you push these little ice blocks around and smoosh the guys in the stage.

01:32:26.520 --> 01:32:27.520
It's a lot of fun.

01:32:27.520 --> 01:32:28.520
It's cute.

01:32:28.520 --> 01:32:31.920
It looks like pac man with a penguin and there's no dots either.

01:32:31.920 --> 01:32:34.000
What are those green things trying to chase you?

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:35.440
The green things are, I guess trying to eat you.

01:32:35.440 --> 01:32:36.440
I don't know.

01:32:36.440 --> 01:32:37.440
Okay.

01:32:37.440 --> 01:32:38.440
We recognize the music too.

01:32:38.440 --> 01:32:39.440
Yeah.

01:32:39.440 --> 01:32:40.440
That became later on.

01:32:40.440 --> 01:32:42.000
I know I've heard it before.

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:43.080
What game was it in?

01:32:43.080 --> 01:32:44.080
What other game was in?

01:32:44.080 --> 01:32:45.080
DDR.

01:32:45.080 --> 01:32:46.080
Oh, raver's choice.

01:32:46.080 --> 01:32:47.080
Oh wow.

01:32:47.080 --> 01:32:48.080
Well there anyway.

01:32:48.080 --> 01:32:49.080
That's not the point.

01:32:49.080 --> 01:32:53.080
The point is it's coming out on the PSP.

01:32:53.080 --> 01:32:54.080
Yay.

01:32:54.080 --> 01:32:58.080
Um, no, wait, no, I take that back.

01:32:58.080 --> 01:33:01.560
It's actually, I'm sorry, no, this is something completely different.

01:33:01.560 --> 01:33:02.560
I'm sorry.

01:33:02.560 --> 01:33:03.760
It looked like a PSP screenshot at first.

01:33:03.760 --> 01:33:05.440
It's actually an arcade game.

01:33:05.440 --> 01:33:09.300
Uh, it's coming out in, uh, arcades in Japan.

01:33:09.300 --> 01:33:13.600
It's going to be an eight player version, eight player, simultaneous penguins running

01:33:13.600 --> 01:33:14.600
around the screen.

01:33:14.600 --> 01:33:15.600
Yay.

01:33:15.600 --> 01:33:18.440
It's not a graphical upgrade at all.

01:33:18.440 --> 01:33:19.440
It's still, it's old school.

01:33:19.440 --> 01:33:21.000
Hey, it's all about the gameplay.

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:22.880
So there you go.

01:33:22.880 --> 01:33:23.880
That's really it.

01:33:23.880 --> 01:33:24.880
That's all there is to say.

01:33:24.880 --> 01:33:26.500
It's getting a new eight player version.

01:33:26.500 --> 01:33:30.960
It's an upgrade there and uh, yeah, I'm, I'm all about checking that out when that comes

01:33:30.960 --> 01:33:31.960
out.

01:33:31.960 --> 01:33:32.960
That's going to be cute.

01:33:32.960 --> 01:33:35.320
Uh, there's, they've really only teased it with one screenshot.

01:33:35.320 --> 01:33:36.840
They really haven't said a lot else.

01:33:36.840 --> 01:33:41.440
Uh, but apparently more information will come out on club Sega on August 6th.

01:33:41.440 --> 01:33:43.440
That'd be pretty cool.

01:33:43.440 --> 01:33:44.440
Yay.

01:33:44.440 --> 01:33:45.440
Woo.

01:33:45.440 --> 01:33:46.440
No, no, no.

01:33:46.440 --> 01:33:47.440
That's speaking of classic games.

01:33:47.440 --> 01:33:50.600
Speaking of Sega, I need to enlist the aid of the chat room because I used to know the

01:33:50.600 --> 01:33:53.240
name of this game and for the life of me, I forgot about it.

01:33:53.240 --> 01:33:58.120
Um, it's a Sega Saturn game that was visual, not visual.

01:33:58.120 --> 01:34:00.720
It was audio only and you grew seeds with it.

01:34:00.720 --> 01:34:04.480
A K the game came with a packet of seeds.

01:34:04.480 --> 01:34:06.920
I've only seen it once in my life and I do not remember the name of it.

01:34:06.920 --> 01:34:09.360
So if anyone can find the name of the game for me, please do.

01:34:09.360 --> 01:34:10.360
So what?

01:34:10.360 --> 01:34:14.400
It was like music to grow seeds by you'd have to, you would control the sound output from

01:34:14.400 --> 01:34:15.640
it or something.

01:34:15.640 --> 01:34:16.720
It was one of those bizarre games.

01:34:16.720 --> 01:34:19.680
This guy's noted for super bizarre games.

01:34:19.680 --> 01:34:22.120
Anyway, okay, continue Rob.

01:34:22.120 --> 01:34:25.760
Okay, we're going to get into the classic game of the week as if that wasn't obscure

01:34:25.760 --> 01:34:26.920
enough for you.

01:34:26.920 --> 01:34:29.120
Now's the part of the show.

01:34:29.120 --> 01:34:34.520
Dark Soccer likes to dig through the gaming vault and find a game that she says, hey,

01:34:34.520 --> 01:34:39.560
you little children, babies of the world, including the new one born tonight.

01:34:39.560 --> 01:34:44.320
Listen, babies, you should be, uh, schooled on these old games.

01:34:44.320 --> 01:34:47.640
When I was your age, I played these games, right?

01:34:47.640 --> 01:34:48.640
Dark Sakura.

01:34:48.640 --> 01:34:49.640
Right.

01:34:49.640 --> 01:34:50.640
You weren't really a baby.

01:34:50.640 --> 01:34:54.920
You were probably like 15 when this particular game came out, but Hey, how old were you?

01:34:54.920 --> 01:34:57.000
Um, I would have been, um, 20.

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:58.000
Oh wow.

01:34:58.000 --> 01:34:59.000
No, no, I take that back.

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:00.000
I would have been 19.

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:01.000
All right.

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.160
Well enough talk about what you age you would have been.

01:35:03.160 --> 01:35:04.320
Let's talk about what the game is.

01:35:04.320 --> 01:35:06.320
What games did you pick for the folks tonight?

01:35:06.320 --> 01:35:09.040
Guardian heroes.

01:35:09.040 --> 01:35:10.040
Guardian heroes.

01:35:10.040 --> 01:35:14.840
Um, if you will play the music, please, that's the character select.

01:35:14.840 --> 01:35:17.640
I love Saturn music.

01:35:17.640 --> 01:35:25.840
Anyway, yeah, the game came out on the Sega Saturn in 1996.

01:35:25.840 --> 01:35:30.560
Actually it was kind of funny because this came out before it did in Japan.

01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:36.080
It came out January 25th in America, January 26th in Japan, which I think might've actually

01:35:36.080 --> 01:35:41.820
if, if I'm doing my no, cause then I was like, I'm trying to think about, you know, across

01:35:41.820 --> 01:35:46.000
time zones if that would've been right, but no, I think Japan's a day ahead of us.

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:47.000
Yeah, it sounds right.

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:48.000
Yeah.

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:53.880
Um, anyway, um, it came out on the Sega Saturn and it was, um, kind of like what Golden Axe

01:35:53.880 --> 01:36:02.340
was, um, sort of 2d side scrolling, beat them up, kind of punching things, you know, using

01:36:02.340 --> 01:36:04.320
magic and swords and stuff.

01:36:04.320 --> 01:36:08.800
Um, there was a sequel that came out in 2004 for the Game Boy Advance that was advanced

01:36:08.800 --> 01:36:17.080
guardian heroes, but it's sort of a, an RPG touch to the beat them up, the genre.

01:36:17.080 --> 01:36:19.800
As you can, those of us in here can tell on Bob's computer.

01:36:19.800 --> 01:36:20.800
Oh, I like it.

01:36:20.800 --> 01:36:21.800
I very much like it.

01:36:21.800 --> 01:36:26.840
It's kind of got the, the, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles feel, you know, street fighter

01:36:26.840 --> 01:36:27.840
2.

01:36:27.840 --> 01:36:28.840
No, it's not a fighting game.

01:36:28.840 --> 01:36:34.480
It's, it's a beat them up, sort of like how, uh, um, Final Fight and you know, Double Dragon.

01:36:34.480 --> 01:36:40.320
Except this one has magic and swords, magic and swords, but there's no blood.

01:36:40.320 --> 01:36:47.160
Anyway, um, going forward, um, it had a versus mode for you to pick up to six different characters

01:36:47.160 --> 01:36:48.720
and compete with the main characters.

01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:55.160
You get unlockable monsters, bosses, and civilians with the time to battle or to death.

01:36:55.160 --> 01:37:00.240
You get experience points through each scene and you can customize your characters with,

01:37:00.240 --> 01:37:01.720
um, six different attributes.

01:37:01.720 --> 01:37:07.920
You have strength, vitality, intelligence, mentality, agility, and luck.

01:37:07.920 --> 01:37:13.840
Um, it's actually luck is good for, um, the spell casters.

01:37:13.840 --> 01:37:17.240
Anyway, um, there is of course the story mode.

01:37:17.240 --> 01:37:20.440
Um, you can actually take different paths along the story.

01:37:20.440 --> 01:37:24.080
So you've got different endings, different bosses, different levels.

01:37:24.080 --> 01:37:28.000
You can, I mean basically it has a ton of replayability just because you can really

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:29.000
keep going.

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:32.040
In fact, this is one thing, and this is one thing that I know my husband loves about this,

01:37:32.040 --> 01:37:37.720
is that, um, there's a path that will lead to gold and silver from Gunstar Heroes.

01:37:37.720 --> 01:37:38.720
So that's pretty cool.

01:37:38.720 --> 01:37:41.480
And keep in mind, this was put up by Treasure.

01:37:41.480 --> 01:37:45.440
So it gets the, oh my God, Treasure Award too.

01:37:45.440 --> 01:37:54.480
Um, and, uh, of course the gold and silver, um, as the final boss uses the, the gem power

01:37:54.480 --> 01:37:56.480
like you did in Gunstar Heroes.

01:37:56.480 --> 01:38:03.360
Um, you really can, um, it has multiple levels in the game.

01:38:03.360 --> 01:38:07.080
You usually only have three planes of battle, the four, the mid, and the back.

01:38:07.080 --> 01:38:09.920
Um, and you can switch them out in sequence.

01:38:09.920 --> 01:38:15.360
Um, and there's also the shoulder buttons will make you move back and forth.

01:38:15.360 --> 01:38:23.040
You also have eva- evasive moves, and, um, you also have, uh, um, like if you get surrounded

01:38:23.040 --> 01:38:24.840
you can change your planes.

01:38:24.840 --> 01:38:27.440
You can move to a foreground or background and whatnot.

01:38:27.440 --> 01:38:29.280
So that's pretty cool.

01:38:29.280 --> 01:38:36.160
Um, with the games you have Samuel Hahn, um, who is, uh, just a physical powerhouse type

01:38:36.160 --> 01:38:37.160
of guy.

01:38:37.160 --> 01:38:43.960
You have Randy M. Green, who, um, has some spells, uh, they're elemental magic.

01:38:43.960 --> 01:38:49.360
Um, Jinjiro Ibushi, who is, um, more moving attacks.

01:38:49.360 --> 01:38:53.040
Uh, Nicole Neal, who has different magic.

01:38:53.040 --> 01:38:57.280
And Serena Corsair, who's supposed to be, um, just a knight.

01:38:57.280 --> 01:38:58.280
Pretty, pretty well-rounded.

01:38:58.280 --> 01:39:07.120
Um, so yeah, it's, it's the big game, it's, uh, a real- and also good luck freaking finding

01:39:07.120 --> 01:39:08.120
it.

01:39:08.120 --> 01:39:10.420
Now, in Japan it was common as derp.

01:39:10.420 --> 01:39:12.040
I mean, super common.

01:39:12.040 --> 01:39:18.880
In the U.S., not so much because, um, they really didn't release very many copies over

01:39:18.880 --> 01:39:23.120
here and of course we didn't, um, you know, they, they released plenty of, uh, advanced

01:39:23.120 --> 01:39:24.120
Guardian Heroes.

01:39:24.120 --> 01:39:29.280
But the Saturn one in the U.S., pretty hard to find and it's got really crappy Americanized

01:39:29.280 --> 01:39:31.280
artwork on the cover.

01:39:31.280 --> 01:39:36.280
Makes me kinda sick, but apart from that, though, I mean, it's a pretty, pretty damn

01:39:36.280 --> 01:39:37.280
good game.

01:39:37.280 --> 01:39:38.280
Alright.

01:39:38.280 --> 01:39:39.500
I'll leave the cover in the chatroom.

01:39:39.500 --> 01:39:43.840
There it is, folks, for the Sega Saturn, your classic game of the week, Guardian Heroes.

01:39:43.840 --> 01:39:46.960
Kind of a neat little, uh, combination there.

01:39:46.960 --> 01:39:48.520
I like it when genres collide.

01:39:48.520 --> 01:39:52.540
Well, and, and on top of that, it's treasure.

01:39:52.540 --> 01:39:55.640
Is there a treasure game you haven't done at this point as a classic game of the week?

01:39:55.640 --> 01:39:58.760
Well, I haven't done, like, Chameleon Twist or, um...

01:39:58.760 --> 01:40:01.320
So that you, you guys can guess what'll be done for the...

01:40:01.320 --> 01:40:03.200
I have, well, no, I might have to eventually do that.

01:40:03.200 --> 01:40:05.200
Have I done, um, Silhouette Mirage?

01:40:05.200 --> 01:40:06.840
I think I have done Silhouette Mirage.

01:40:06.840 --> 01:40:07.840
You have to check the wiki.

01:40:07.840 --> 01:40:08.840
I can't remember.

01:40:08.840 --> 01:40:09.840
I have to look.

01:40:09.840 --> 01:40:12.840
I mean, over, over 125 classic games of the week at this point.

01:40:12.840 --> 01:40:13.840
Crazy.

01:40:13.840 --> 01:40:14.840
Alright.

01:40:14.840 --> 01:40:17.520
Anyhow, uh, we're gonna go ahead and take a break, but we'll be back.

01:40:17.520 --> 01:40:18.520
I have done it.

01:40:18.520 --> 01:40:20.520
There is plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio to come.

01:40:20.520 --> 01:40:23.000
We're gonna talk about Microsoft Kinect in the next segment.

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:26.880
We're gonna talk about Silent Hill and a new comic book, apparently, coming out.

01:40:26.880 --> 01:40:29.900
And yes, believe it or not, more Facebook games.

01:40:29.900 --> 01:40:31.800
We have to talk about Zynga tonight.

01:40:31.800 --> 01:40:32.800
I know.

01:40:32.800 --> 01:40:33.800
I know.

01:40:33.800 --> 01:40:34.800
Don't tune out.

01:40:34.800 --> 01:40:35.800
I promise you.

01:40:35.800 --> 01:40:36.800
Rob.

01:40:36.800 --> 01:40:37.800
It's gonna be lol-tastic.

01:40:37.800 --> 01:40:41.080
We're gonna be back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:40:41.080 --> 01:40:42.080
Stay tuned.

01:40:42.080 --> 01:40:50.800
Hello, everybody, and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:40:50.800 --> 01:40:56.280
We are taping live on this August 1st of 2010 here at Orange Lounge Radio headquarters,

01:40:56.280 --> 01:40:58.220
live at allgames.com.

01:40:58.220 --> 01:41:01.240
And today is actually a very special day in OLR history.

01:41:01.240 --> 01:41:05.520
Loki is not here tonight because his baby boy was just born earlier this evening at

01:41:05.520 --> 01:41:07.080
five, about five o'clock.

01:41:07.080 --> 01:41:10.160
Joshua is the boy's name, in case you were wondering, and you didn't hear earlier in

01:41:10.160 --> 01:41:12.160
the show.

01:41:12.160 --> 01:41:13.300
So we won't have Loki.

01:41:13.300 --> 01:41:16.080
We anticipate he'll be out about a month.

01:41:16.080 --> 01:41:17.680
So I mean, I don't know.

01:41:17.680 --> 01:41:20.540
Knowing him, he might try to come back next week, but hopefully he'll take some time off

01:41:20.540 --> 01:41:23.460
to go be with the baby and his wife during this very awesome time.

01:41:23.460 --> 01:41:25.120
So in the meantime, we have guests galore.

01:41:25.120 --> 01:41:28.160
So we have a couple joining us in the studio tonight, so welcome back.

01:41:28.160 --> 01:41:29.680
I hope you guys are having fun so far.

01:41:29.680 --> 01:41:30.680
I'm having a blast.

01:41:30.680 --> 01:41:31.680
Mila and Gary are here.

01:41:31.680 --> 01:41:32.680
Yay.

01:41:32.680 --> 01:41:33.680
I'm having an absolute blast.

01:41:33.680 --> 01:41:34.680
Awesome.

01:41:34.680 --> 01:41:35.680
This is so much fun.

01:41:35.680 --> 01:41:36.680
Now I know why Drew comes.

01:41:36.680 --> 01:41:37.680
He comes all the way through.

01:41:37.680 --> 01:41:38.680
That's the best part.

01:41:38.680 --> 01:41:40.200
We haven't even gotten emails or tweets.

01:41:40.200 --> 01:41:41.560
We got Twitters to get to it a little bit.

01:41:41.560 --> 01:41:42.560
But wait, there's more.

01:41:42.560 --> 01:41:43.560
But wait, there's more.

01:41:43.560 --> 01:41:45.240
In fact, you only got about five more minutes to get Twitter topics in.

01:41:45.240 --> 01:41:48.200
I have not been able to do any plugs on Twitter tonight because I've been so busy.

01:41:48.200 --> 01:41:51.240
So I don't know if we're going to have anything waiting for us there, but I'll look.

01:41:51.240 --> 01:41:53.360
We have spam in French.

01:41:53.360 --> 01:41:55.120
We get spam in French all the time.

01:41:55.120 --> 01:41:56.120
I know.

01:41:56.120 --> 01:41:58.080
I was just laughing because I can read it.

01:41:58.080 --> 01:41:59.960
They think the show is based out of Quebec or something.

01:41:59.960 --> 01:42:00.960
I don't know.

01:42:00.960 --> 01:42:04.400
All right, let's get to some rapid, rapid news, some quick news that we like to go over

01:42:04.400 --> 01:42:08.120
very quickly before we get to the Twitter topics tonight.

01:42:08.120 --> 01:42:11.360
I'll start tonight since we don't have Loki.

01:42:11.360 --> 01:42:16.720
We have some news about some Call of Duty, I guess, special edition games.

01:42:16.720 --> 01:42:18.120
These are black ops.

01:42:18.120 --> 01:42:23.160
There's going to be a prestige edition for 150 bucks and a hardened edition for 80 bucks.

01:42:23.160 --> 01:42:25.200
I guess these are some rumors picked up.

01:42:25.200 --> 01:42:29.480
It was on buy.com, but the listing was since pulled.

01:42:29.480 --> 01:42:34.680
I can tell you this, though, the rumblings around and people that I know and, you know,

01:42:34.680 --> 01:42:37.400
I got friends in low places and so forth.

01:42:37.400 --> 01:42:39.840
Orange on Trady wants to tell you guys this is true.

01:42:39.840 --> 01:42:45.000
These are happening, but I mean, also, that's kind of like telling you like rain will eventually

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:46.480
fall from the sky next month.

01:42:46.480 --> 01:42:49.360
Of course, there's going to be limited editions of these huge games.

01:42:49.360 --> 01:42:50.720
Shouldn't be a huge surprise.

01:42:50.720 --> 01:42:54.640
Activision hasn't officially announced it yet, but they will prestige for 150 bucks,

01:42:54.640 --> 01:42:56.560
hardened edition for $80.

01:42:56.560 --> 01:42:58.440
Couldn't tell you what's in those.

01:42:58.440 --> 01:43:05.400
Although we're hearing possibly like something about maybe a little car.

01:43:05.400 --> 01:43:06.400
I don't know.

01:43:06.400 --> 01:43:08.480
Take that with what you will.

01:43:08.480 --> 01:43:10.120
This is one that Activision will talk about.

01:43:10.120 --> 01:43:14.000
It is DJ Tiesto is actually joining DJ Hero 2.

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:17.400
He's actually going to be in the game as a playable character, and he's going to be doing

01:43:17.400 --> 01:43:18.880
two new mixes in the game.

01:43:18.880 --> 01:43:20.600
I think that's kind of rad.

01:43:20.600 --> 01:43:27.800
No news yet as to exactly what he's doing, but there was a little video that was released,

01:43:27.800 --> 01:43:29.760
so I'm not sure what this video shows us.

01:43:29.760 --> 01:43:33.400
I think it just shows him in game, and it might be like playing one of his mixes here,

01:43:33.400 --> 01:43:39.120
but they did release a little clip here from DJ Hero 2.

01:43:39.120 --> 01:43:43.720
I'm trying to get a little more of it here in studio, but the first one was really awesome.

01:43:43.720 --> 01:43:45.720
Oh, I love DJ Hero 1.

01:43:45.720 --> 01:43:47.720
I'm a DJ.

01:43:47.720 --> 01:43:52.000
Play for so many people.

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:53.720
I'm very lucky that I have that opportunity.

01:43:53.720 --> 01:43:54.720
Nah, I don't want to hear the whole interview.

01:43:54.720 --> 01:43:55.720
I was hoping to hear more of his music.

01:43:55.720 --> 01:43:58.760
He'll be part of DJ Hero Gamers.

01:43:58.760 --> 01:44:01.800
Alright, he'll be in DJ Hero, hooray for him.

01:44:01.800 --> 01:44:03.600
Alright, also Kmart.

01:44:03.600 --> 01:44:07.560
Wow, this is like three shows in a row we've actually had a Kmart story.

01:44:07.560 --> 01:44:09.200
I don't get this.

01:44:09.200 --> 01:44:10.560
When did Kmart become relevant?

01:44:10.560 --> 01:44:11.560
I don't understand.

01:44:11.560 --> 01:44:12.560
This is so weird.

01:44:12.560 --> 01:44:14.880
Well, you know they've done the whole rebranding thing, so perhaps.

01:44:14.880 --> 01:44:18.800
Well, they're really trying to appeal to the gamers, and this is a pretty big one.

01:44:18.800 --> 01:44:20.960
This is a great way to appeal to gamers.

01:44:20.960 --> 01:44:22.720
Sell stuff cheap.

01:44:22.720 --> 01:44:26.360
The Wii console, down to $179.99 this week.

01:44:26.360 --> 01:44:27.360
What is it?

01:44:27.360 --> 01:44:32.920
A whole $20 off, but hey, that's 10% of the cost, so hard to complain about that.

01:44:32.920 --> 01:44:36.920
By the way, the deal runs out tomorrow, so you better hurry up and get on that.

01:44:36.920 --> 01:44:37.920
Aw, damn.

01:44:37.920 --> 01:44:39.520
It just came right around the corner from my house.

01:44:39.520 --> 01:44:42.720
Both the white and the black Wiis, just so you know.

01:44:42.720 --> 01:44:44.440
I have no money, no.

01:44:44.440 --> 01:44:46.840
Well, how about some other stuff?

01:44:46.840 --> 01:44:47.840
How about it?

01:44:47.840 --> 01:44:48.840
Yeah.

01:44:48.840 --> 01:44:49.840
This makes me particularly happy.

01:44:49.840 --> 01:44:52.840
In the rock band, we have Blondie.

01:44:52.840 --> 01:44:53.840
Yay!

01:44:53.840 --> 01:44:54.840
Ooh.

01:44:54.840 --> 01:44:58.960
There's already a little Blondie in there, but I'm never gonna say no to more Blondie.

01:44:58.960 --> 01:45:02.640
And also a group that I like, Family Force 5.

01:45:02.640 --> 01:45:03.640
Money?

01:45:03.640 --> 01:45:09.280
So, actually, so with this upcoming pack that's gonna be out on August 3rd, we have Rapture

01:45:09.280 --> 01:45:16.520
for Blondie, Jesus Freak DC Talk, whatever, The Perfect Crime number 2, The Decemberists,

01:45:16.520 --> 01:45:22.660
I Only Want You, Eagles of Death Metal, Saturday Morning Eels, Love Addict Family Force 5,

01:45:22.660 --> 01:45:28.280
Sturm and Drang, KMFDM, and Bulletproof LaRue.

01:45:28.280 --> 01:45:29.280
Shut up.

01:45:29.280 --> 01:45:30.280
What, in rock band?

01:45:30.280 --> 01:45:31.280
Mm-hmm.

01:45:31.280 --> 01:45:32.280
We're getting Bulletproof?

01:45:32.280 --> 01:45:33.280
Yeah.

01:45:33.280 --> 01:45:34.280
I love that song.

01:45:34.280 --> 01:45:35.280
Even though it's way overplayed on the radio right now.

01:45:35.280 --> 01:45:36.280
Yay!

01:45:36.280 --> 01:45:37.280
I loved it like nine months ago.

01:45:37.280 --> 01:45:38.280
Awesome.

01:45:38.280 --> 01:45:39.560
I'm getting DC Talk.

01:45:39.560 --> 01:45:40.560
That's funny.

01:45:40.560 --> 01:45:41.560
Oh, come on.

01:45:41.560 --> 01:45:43.560
Let's give him a break.

01:45:43.560 --> 01:45:52.400
ASRB has Fatal Labyrinth, which was a Sega Genesis game.

01:45:52.400 --> 01:45:58.280
It's supposed to be set up on, well, it's on the PC downloads, but it's also gonna be

01:45:58.280 --> 01:46:04.640
available for Wii, for the Virtual Console, and Mac, PS3, Xbox 360.

01:46:04.640 --> 01:46:06.440
It's in the Genesis collection thingy.

01:46:06.440 --> 01:46:07.440
Yes it is.

01:46:07.440 --> 01:46:08.440
Don't bother.

01:46:08.440 --> 01:46:09.440
In the Sonic Ultimate Genesis collection.

01:46:09.440 --> 01:46:11.200
I mean, get the Sonic collection.

01:46:11.200 --> 01:46:15.560
It's great, but don't bother with a $5 standalone release when you get that collection for $20.

01:46:15.560 --> 01:46:16.560
It's great.

01:46:16.560 --> 01:46:17.560
Mm-hmm.

01:46:17.560 --> 01:46:18.560
And you get, like, tons of stuff right now.

01:46:18.560 --> 01:46:19.880
Sometimes it is worth it to pay more.

01:46:19.880 --> 01:46:21.280
And that game kind of blows.

01:46:21.280 --> 01:46:25.000
I mean, I hate to say it, but it's kind of like somebody decided to port, I don't know

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:28.440
if you guys know Rogue, the old-ass game from, like, years and years ago.

01:46:28.440 --> 01:46:32.240
Somebody decided to port Rogue to the Sega Genesis, and that's kind of what you got.

01:46:32.240 --> 01:46:33.800
And Rogue is more fun.

01:46:33.800 --> 01:46:43.800
Well, um, now also in other news, there is a mandatory update for PS3 firmware 3.41.

01:46:43.800 --> 01:46:50.040
So it's gonna add in a You May Like section to the PlayStation Store.

01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:52.040
And really, that's about it.

01:46:52.040 --> 01:46:54.040
There's nothing else.

01:46:54.040 --> 01:46:55.760
But it's mandatory.

01:46:55.760 --> 01:46:58.720
That's like how Twitter now shows me people I ought to be following.

01:46:58.720 --> 01:47:00.160
I don't give a crap.

01:47:00.160 --> 01:47:01.160
Anyway.

01:47:01.160 --> 01:47:06.120
I know, I'm like, a lot of these people I'm not following for a reason, just so you know.

01:47:06.120 --> 01:47:11.160
All right, let's go to Twitter topics and visit the Tweeter and see who's sending us

01:47:11.160 --> 01:47:13.960
messages.

01:47:13.960 --> 01:47:17.040
Not a lot, because I forgot to put the call out on Twitter earlier this evening, because

01:47:17.040 --> 01:47:19.160
I was kind of, you know, I had a lot going on.

01:47:19.160 --> 01:47:21.240
You know, stuff and things and such as.

01:47:21.240 --> 01:47:25.160
But we did, that did not stop some tweets from coming in, and we're very excited that

01:47:25.160 --> 01:47:27.240
at least a handful of tweets are coming in.

01:47:27.240 --> 01:47:33.280
First one from Tiger Claw, because he always will dig up a story that we somehow overlook.

01:47:33.280 --> 01:47:35.800
And this is definitely one that I think is interesting, that we did overlook, and it

01:47:35.800 --> 01:47:40.720
comes from the International Business Times that he's actually linking us to.

01:47:40.720 --> 01:47:46.280
China is actually pushing a real name system for online games, and that starts today, August

01:47:46.280 --> 01:47:47.280
1st.

01:47:47.280 --> 01:47:50.020
You're gonna have to register using your real name if you want to play an online game.

01:47:50.020 --> 01:47:52.360
This is like real ID gone wrong.

01:47:52.360 --> 01:47:53.960
Really wrong.

01:47:53.960 --> 01:47:55.300
That comes from the Ministry of Culture.

01:47:55.300 --> 01:48:01.480
It was announced on June 22nd, and it's part of a nationwide campaign to improve management

01:48:01.480 --> 01:48:05.760
of the virtual gaming industry and protect the minor from unwholesome content.

01:48:05.760 --> 01:48:08.360
Well, you do realize this is China, right?

01:48:08.360 --> 01:48:10.040
Yeah, I know, it's different.

01:48:10.040 --> 01:48:11.720
It's obviously a lot different than real ID.

01:48:11.720 --> 01:48:18.520
Well, they have some serious issues with people not managing their time well on these MMOs,

01:48:18.520 --> 01:48:19.520
right?

01:48:19.520 --> 01:48:20.520
So, I don't know.

01:48:20.520 --> 01:48:23.560
I mean, but then again, we have some people with issues not managing their time well in

01:48:23.560 --> 01:48:27.600
America as well, so it just seems to be a lot worse.

01:48:27.600 --> 01:48:29.440
Some of the stories you hear are really, really scary over there.

01:48:29.440 --> 01:48:33.120
I don't know what they're talking about, Shifty Eyes, Shifty Eyes.

01:48:33.120 --> 01:48:36.600
But anyhow, how would you like it if they stepped in and said, hey, everybody's gonna

01:48:36.600 --> 01:48:38.320
have to play online games with their real name.

01:48:38.320 --> 01:48:39.320
Do not want.

01:48:39.320 --> 01:48:40.320
Do not want.

01:48:40.320 --> 01:48:42.320
Good luck with that, China.

01:48:42.320 --> 01:48:45.760
All right, next up though, speaking of China, how about Chinatown?

01:48:45.760 --> 01:48:50.000
Matt, sj100matt on Twitter actually wanted to link us to this.

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.840
He kind of wanted to give a shout out to one of his local arcades.

01:48:52.840 --> 01:48:57.400
I've heard of this place, but I've never been, and he was very proud that Kotaku had featured

01:48:57.400 --> 01:49:01.840
it this week, because you know, they're one of the big boy gaming blogs, and so they feature

01:49:01.840 --> 01:49:03.400
stuff once in a while.

01:49:03.400 --> 01:49:07.000
And they are talking about the Chinatown Fair Video Arcade.

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:10.680
It is located on Mott Street in New York City's Chinatown.

01:49:10.680 --> 01:49:17.240
Apparently, it is also this environment that LGBT youth can just kind of be themselves.

01:49:17.240 --> 01:49:18.560
Oh yeah, I read about that.

01:49:18.560 --> 01:49:25.000
Kind of interesting that it's gaming and LGBT colliding, although I thought it was really

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:26.600
cool when I went to that place in Portland.

01:49:26.600 --> 01:49:29.640
They had like an LGBT night once a month, which I thought was kind of fun.

01:49:29.640 --> 01:49:31.040
All the gay gamers can get together.

01:49:31.040 --> 01:49:37.200
You know, I really feel that they need to include the asexual on that list too.

01:49:37.200 --> 01:49:42.020
Well there's a big old long string of alphabet soup, but you know, at some point it gets

01:49:42.020 --> 01:49:43.020
too big.

01:49:43.020 --> 01:49:44.020
You know what I mean?

01:49:44.020 --> 01:49:47.840
But anyway, let's see, what else do I want to say?

01:49:47.840 --> 01:49:51.300
They wrote this nice little article on it that talked about, you know, that basically

01:49:51.300 --> 01:49:54.780
it's a very diverse place and all the customers are very valued.

01:49:54.780 --> 01:49:57.760
As they should be, that's just good customer service folks.

01:49:57.760 --> 01:50:01.000
So a quote from one of the patrons of the place, we get all sorts.

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:05.780
We got dudes that go to raves, we got anime nerds, otaku, we get professional players.

01:50:05.780 --> 01:50:09.800
So it just sounds like this hodgepodge of just go play and have fun.

01:50:09.800 --> 01:50:11.480
That's what video games should be about anyway.

01:50:11.480 --> 01:50:18.360
It shouldn't even be about LGBT or raevars or otaku or whatever.

01:50:18.360 --> 01:50:19.760
Just have fun.

01:50:19.760 --> 01:50:20.760
Don't be a dick.

01:50:20.760 --> 01:50:21.760
Yeah, exactly.

01:50:21.760 --> 01:50:24.840
We got enough clicks in the real world.

01:50:24.840 --> 01:50:27.600
Always remember rule one, don't be a dick.

01:50:27.600 --> 01:50:28.600
Exactly.

01:50:28.600 --> 01:50:29.600
Exactly.

01:50:29.600 --> 01:50:30.600
Don't be a dick.

01:50:30.600 --> 01:50:32.720
And don't bring your click into the virtual world.

01:50:32.720 --> 01:50:37.760
And then lastly, Dark Tetsuya on the tweeters wants us to plug his latest retro review for

01:50:37.760 --> 01:50:39.160
Mega Man on the site.

01:50:39.160 --> 01:50:42.400
It's actually pretty awesome, so go check that out at orangeslunchradio.com.

01:50:42.400 --> 01:50:47.920
Whole little, I don't want to say expose on Mega Man, but it's a nice little retrospective.

01:50:47.920 --> 01:50:50.360
The original Mega Man games, I remember those very fondly.

01:50:50.360 --> 01:50:51.360
They were awesome.

01:50:51.360 --> 01:50:55.240
Oh man, you got to see some of the new ones, because the new ones are, they invoke the

01:50:55.240 --> 01:50:56.680
old ones very well.

01:50:56.680 --> 01:50:57.680
It's very cool.

01:50:57.680 --> 01:50:59.040
Very, very cool.

01:50:59.040 --> 01:51:01.600
All right, let's get back into some other news here.

01:51:01.600 --> 01:51:03.520
I'm going to start off with a story on Kinect.

01:51:03.520 --> 01:51:07.400
Kinect, of course, being the motion control device coming out from Microsoft.

01:51:07.400 --> 01:51:12.920
We announced last week that it was going to be $150, although, obviously, speculation

01:51:12.920 --> 01:51:16.160
had run rampant on that for a while.

01:51:16.160 --> 01:51:18.160
It's coming with Kinect Adventures.

01:51:18.160 --> 01:51:21.280
And of course, they got a lot of shit for that.

01:51:21.280 --> 01:51:23.680
Well, I guess they came out this week.

01:51:23.680 --> 01:51:26.160
It was the marketing manager, Brett Siddons.

01:51:26.160 --> 01:51:29.080
He's the marketing manager for Microsoft Kinect.

01:51:29.080 --> 01:51:31.080
He was at an event in the UK for Amazon.

01:51:31.080 --> 01:51:34.880
He says that the Kinect is, quote, very competitively priced.

01:51:34.880 --> 01:51:38.200
Now, since he was in the UK, he was talking about UK pricing.

01:51:38.200 --> 01:51:39.200
But you know what?

01:51:39.200 --> 01:51:41.400
It's all the same deal at the end of the day.

01:51:41.400 --> 01:51:46.960
He's basically saying that the navigation controller is going to be an extra $30 on

01:51:46.960 --> 01:51:49.000
top of the $100 bundle.

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:53.180
At least that is the Sony, you know, way of looking at things.

01:51:53.180 --> 01:51:57.640
So I think we talked a little bit about price chart last week anyway that showed everything

01:51:57.640 --> 01:51:59.040
kind of all in a row there.

01:51:59.040 --> 01:52:04.520
And yeah, if you want to get the whole deal for PlayStation Move, it's a little bit more

01:52:04.520 --> 01:52:07.900
expensive than Kinect, especially when it's two people.

01:52:07.900 --> 01:52:13.320
So anyway, Microsoft is basically trying to say, hey, if you want two people to have fun,

01:52:13.320 --> 01:52:17.560
you only need one Kinect, whereas with all these other systems, you need two of everything.

01:52:17.560 --> 01:52:19.240
And we kind of knew they'd go this way.

01:52:19.240 --> 01:52:23.160
And I think as we talked about last week a little bit, it's kind of like, well, but your

01:52:23.160 --> 01:52:28.960
console then offsets the price of a Wii and it's really all about the games at the end

01:52:28.960 --> 01:52:29.960
of the day, honestly.

01:52:29.960 --> 01:52:34.480
I mean, you can charge plenty for this system as long as you have the games to back it up.

01:52:34.480 --> 01:52:38.840
But if Dance Central is going to be your only good game, I don't know if it's worth the

01:52:38.840 --> 01:52:39.840
time.

01:52:39.840 --> 01:52:46.960
Of all the E3 games that I saw for the Kinect, the one that I really would love to go over

01:52:46.960 --> 01:52:54.840
to a friend's house and play because I do not own a 360, God forbid, is the Children

01:52:54.840 --> 01:52:56.240
of Eden.

01:52:56.240 --> 01:52:57.320
Looks amazing.

01:52:57.320 --> 01:52:58.320
It does look great.

01:52:58.320 --> 01:53:01.080
It's too bad they didn't have a playable one on the show floor, so we don't know enough

01:53:01.080 --> 01:53:02.080
about it.

01:53:02.080 --> 01:53:05.240
If you can't imagine it's going to be Rez using your body, that's cool enough for me.

01:53:05.240 --> 01:53:08.160
Yeah, that just looks absolutely amazing.

01:53:08.160 --> 01:53:09.160
And so.

01:53:09.160 --> 01:53:10.160
It'll be great.

01:53:10.160 --> 01:53:11.160
All right.

01:53:11.160 --> 01:53:14.480
Dr. Sakura, what do you got for us?

01:53:14.480 --> 01:53:15.480
Stuff.

01:53:15.480 --> 01:53:18.520
Well, this is actually pretty cool.

01:53:18.520 --> 01:53:26.680
Silent Hill 8, the guy who's writing it, Tom Waltz, is also working on a comic book crossover

01:53:26.680 --> 01:53:29.280
called Silent Hill Past Life.

01:53:29.280 --> 01:53:38.920
But in 1867, and it was about an outlaw called Jebediah Foster, who meets a widow that changes

01:53:38.920 --> 01:53:40.560
his ways.

01:53:40.560 --> 01:53:45.640
And they move to Silent Hill to escape the Wild West.

01:53:45.640 --> 01:53:49.560
But of course Silent Hill screws him over.

01:53:49.560 --> 01:53:55.400
But it's that the game is going to feature a character from the comic, although the game

01:53:55.400 --> 01:53:58.140
is in modern times.

01:53:58.140 --> 01:54:04.760
So hey, I hope that they do better trailers out there for Silent Hill 8, and I really

01:54:04.760 --> 01:54:08.560
need to sit down and watch it.

01:54:08.560 --> 01:54:10.240
They showed a little bit at E3.

01:54:10.240 --> 01:54:12.840
It looked all right.

01:54:12.840 --> 01:54:15.560
I like that you have to put in your birthday.

01:54:15.560 --> 01:54:18.120
Because it's restricted content, young lady.

01:54:18.120 --> 01:54:19.120
I know.

01:54:19.120 --> 01:54:20.120
All right.

01:54:20.120 --> 01:54:24.160
Well, while she's watching that, I have to bring this up.

01:54:24.160 --> 01:54:28.680
I apologize in advance, but let's all poke a little fun at Zynga this week.

01:54:28.680 --> 01:54:31.600
Because they did something where they're getting a lot of shit for it.

01:54:31.600 --> 01:54:34.600
So if you don't like Zynga, you can kind of like jump on the bandwagon with this.

01:54:34.600 --> 01:54:35.600
It'll be fun.

01:54:35.600 --> 01:54:36.600
Okay, here's the deal.

01:54:36.600 --> 01:54:37.880
Zynga has this game on Facebook.

01:54:37.880 --> 01:54:39.920
It's called Street Racing.

01:54:39.920 --> 01:54:44.520
And they announced, with really no rhyme or reason, that they are shutting the game down

01:54:44.520 --> 01:54:47.000
tomorrow, August 2nd.

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:48.640
I don't know what Street Racing is.

01:54:48.640 --> 01:54:49.640
I've never played it.

01:54:49.640 --> 01:54:52.400
I'm just going to guess it's Farmville with Cars.

01:54:52.400 --> 01:54:53.400
Okay?

01:54:53.400 --> 01:54:54.480
That's just my guess.

01:54:54.480 --> 01:54:57.840
Or maybe it's like Mafia Wars, but with street cars.

01:54:57.840 --> 01:54:58.960
Maybe it's like Fast and the Furious.

01:54:58.960 --> 01:54:59.960
I don't know.

01:54:59.960 --> 01:55:03.560
Regardless, whatever the reason, this game is being shut down tomorrow.

01:55:03.560 --> 01:55:05.720
No rhyme or reason why they're doing it.

01:55:05.720 --> 01:55:11.240
Now, if you know Zynga, part of the way they make money is that they try to get you to

01:55:11.240 --> 01:55:15.080
buy shit in game with, you know, they pop up all these things about, you know, what

01:55:15.080 --> 01:55:18.000
you can get for, you know, extra money.

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:21.040
If you give them money, you can get this in game.

01:55:21.040 --> 01:55:25.200
And so a lot of people are wondering, well, if I paid money for Street Racing, which,

01:55:25.200 --> 01:55:29.480
believe it or not, a lot of people did, what's going to happen?

01:55:29.480 --> 01:55:34.120
Well, Zynga came out this week and said, quote, as an acknowledgement of the inconvenience

01:55:34.120 --> 01:55:38.800
these changes may have caused, we have offered credits to all players who have made a purchase

01:55:38.800 --> 01:55:42.040
in the last 90 days.

01:55:42.040 --> 01:55:44.540
All right.

01:55:44.540 --> 01:55:48.400
So these players will receive a credit for the exact amounts of their purchases, plus

01:55:48.400 --> 01:55:55.280
an additional hundred units of premium currency in any of Zynga's nine most popular games.

01:55:55.280 --> 01:55:58.880
So in other words, if you bought stuff, they're not going to refund you.

01:55:58.880 --> 01:56:03.680
They're just going to let you have credits for other games.

01:56:03.680 --> 01:56:08.740
What if I don't want those other games?

01:56:08.740 --> 01:56:12.280
Although we can kind of sit here and kind of point and laugh and haha at Zynga and who

01:56:12.280 --> 01:56:16.960
bought that shit anyway, it does kind of lead to this scary precedent.

01:56:16.960 --> 01:56:24.240
For example, right now you can buy things in World of Warcraft, right?

01:56:24.240 --> 01:56:28.960
And what if in World of Warcraft you buy, I don't know, like a pet?

01:56:28.960 --> 01:56:30.920
What's going to happen when World of Warcraft goes away?

01:56:30.920 --> 01:56:37.400
You lose that pet, which, you know, duh, you should know that games don't last forever

01:56:37.400 --> 01:56:38.400
and so forth.

01:56:38.400 --> 01:56:42.840
But it should be something you think about before you get these, you know, untangible

01:56:42.840 --> 01:56:43.840
items.

01:56:43.840 --> 01:56:44.840
Correct?

01:56:44.840 --> 01:56:47.000
So this serves as a little bit of a lesson.

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:52.960
If ever this game decides to shut its doors, it's gone.

01:56:52.960 --> 01:56:55.640
You know, there is a members runescape as well as a freerunscape.

01:56:55.640 --> 01:56:58.920
Yes, I'm going back on a kick for about two seconds.

01:56:58.920 --> 01:57:03.520
But if you run out of membership money and it boots you back into free world, you keep

01:57:03.520 --> 01:57:04.980
all your stuff.

01:57:04.980 --> 01:57:07.280
You just can't use anything.

01:57:07.280 --> 01:57:13.220
So you keep all your members' stuff that you, you know, bought or acquired or whatever,

01:57:13.220 --> 01:57:18.720
but it just stays in your bank and pretty much useless until you get more money.

01:57:18.720 --> 01:57:20.760
So you don't lose it.

01:57:20.760 --> 01:57:29.240
You don't lose it, which, you know, the whole thing that they're shutting it down, you know,

01:57:29.240 --> 01:57:33.760
it's for no rhyme or reason, nothing.

01:57:33.760 --> 01:57:36.480
They're not saying why Street Racer got shut down.

01:57:36.480 --> 01:57:40.680
I'm wondering if it has to do with the fact that street racing is kind of like a, you

01:57:40.680 --> 01:57:44.040
know, borderline legality type of thing, and maybe they're getting in shit because they're

01:57:44.040 --> 01:57:49.360
promoting something that's, you know, kind of illegal in a way.

01:57:49.360 --> 01:57:52.120
I wonder if that's, that's probably what it's about.

01:57:52.120 --> 01:57:55.480
Anyhow, let's see.

01:57:55.480 --> 01:57:57.760
Where are we at?

01:57:57.760 --> 01:58:00.000
Comments in chatroom chat.orangelandtrady.com.

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:04.520
Bonds 006 says, but Neopets, Petpet, they live, I hope.

01:58:04.520 --> 01:58:07.360
Neopets is another one of those sites that might go away someday.

01:58:07.360 --> 01:58:12.240
Hitstun, if ever Xbox live goes offline, you can't play any of the Xbox live indie games

01:58:12.240 --> 01:58:13.240
you bought.

01:58:13.240 --> 01:58:14.240
Good point.

01:58:14.240 --> 01:58:17.360
I mean, original Xbox was just shut down a couple months ago.

01:58:17.360 --> 01:58:21.280
Does that mean in about five years, the Xbox we have now is also going to get shut down

01:58:21.280 --> 01:58:23.700
and then all these indie games go wrong?

01:58:23.700 --> 01:58:26.840
It's kind of funny because a lot of people were giving crap to on live.

01:58:26.840 --> 01:58:30.480
The new service that's out to let you play games like through the streaming service.

01:58:30.480 --> 01:58:33.800
Like you're going to buy this game for $50, but it's really only guaranteed to work for

01:58:33.800 --> 01:58:34.800
three years.

01:58:34.800 --> 01:58:36.840
Then they might pull the plug on, on live.

01:58:36.840 --> 01:58:41.080
Whereas if you go to the store and buy a game for $50, you pretty much have it quote unquote

01:58:41.080 --> 01:58:43.520
forever.

01:58:43.520 --> 01:58:44.520
Just things to think about.

01:58:44.520 --> 01:58:48.360
I don't know one way or the other.

01:58:48.360 --> 01:58:52.720
It's kind of almost reminds me of the old school Nintendo, how they would, you know,

01:58:52.720 --> 01:58:57.480
every time a new console would come out, you can't use the old school games in the new

01:58:57.480 --> 01:58:58.480
console.

01:58:58.480 --> 01:59:03.040
So it's like you just, you know, plunker down 15 bucks to buy that really awesome version

01:59:03.040 --> 01:59:04.040
of Zelda.

01:59:04.040 --> 01:59:05.040
That won't go in your Super Nintendo.

01:59:05.040 --> 01:59:06.840
Yeah, nothing was backward compatible.

01:59:06.840 --> 01:59:11.560
That's why I kind of stuck to the PlayStation series so I can play my old PlayStation games

01:59:11.560 --> 01:59:12.560
on the PS2.

01:59:12.560 --> 01:59:15.920
I guess they're all backward compatible with the PS3 too.

01:59:15.920 --> 01:59:19.740
PS1 is, but you, and this is what doesn't make sense about Sony.

01:59:19.740 --> 01:59:24.480
It depends what console you got and how early you bought a PS3 if you can backwards compatible

01:59:24.480 --> 01:59:25.480
or can't.

01:59:25.480 --> 01:59:26.480
I think she can, but I can't.

01:59:26.480 --> 01:59:30.560
I can because I got, we have a first release PS3.

01:59:30.560 --> 01:59:34.620
They took out a lot of the extra bells and whistles with later releases.

01:59:34.620 --> 01:59:38.160
So if I bought a PS3 now I wouldn't be able to, he probably couldn't do jack shit.

01:59:38.160 --> 01:59:42.240
No sir, not unless you got really lucky in finding a used one and a lot of people jack

01:59:42.240 --> 01:59:44.480
up the prices of those that are backwards compatible.

01:59:44.480 --> 01:59:45.480
Thanks.

01:59:45.480 --> 01:59:50.240
You know what's extra funny is that usually Dan and I wait until second releases come

01:59:50.240 --> 01:59:55.920
out for when we get stuff because we're usually not initial adopters of consoles and phones

01:59:55.920 --> 02:00:00.760
and stuff, but we got this right away and we sort of got a reward because our Discover

02:00:00.760 --> 02:00:03.420
card gave us back a hundred bucks.

02:00:03.420 --> 02:00:05.560
So would a new PS3 let you play a PS2 game?

02:00:05.560 --> 02:00:08.040
Cause I know they still sell PS2 games.

02:00:08.040 --> 02:00:09.040
Nope.

02:00:09.040 --> 02:00:12.080
However, I think I've got an extra PS2 you could probably borrow.

02:00:12.080 --> 02:00:16.660
But you can play, you can play PS1 games.

02:00:16.660 --> 02:00:17.660
And imports, right?

02:00:17.660 --> 02:00:18.660
Import PS1 games.

02:00:18.660 --> 02:00:19.660
Uh, no.

02:00:19.660 --> 02:00:24.240
The region locks are still in place for PS1 and PS2, but it's region free for the new

02:00:24.240 --> 02:00:25.240
games.

02:00:25.240 --> 02:00:26.240
That's right.

02:00:26.240 --> 02:00:27.240
PS3 games are region free.

02:00:27.240 --> 02:00:28.240
Yeah.

02:00:28.240 --> 02:00:34.040
Which is interesting, but you might remember like Loki imported a, uh, uh, racing game

02:00:34.040 --> 02:00:37.460
that he thought was awful, but he imported it.

02:00:37.460 --> 02:00:42.480
So the, and the exciting thing is if BeatMania 2DX ever comes out on the PlayStation 3, you

02:00:42.480 --> 02:00:46.720
know, that was a, I know that was the game that made me buy a Japanese PlayStation 2

02:00:46.720 --> 02:00:47.720
so I could play it.

02:00:47.720 --> 02:00:48.720
Same here.

02:00:48.720 --> 02:00:50.640
That's how obsessed with this music game series I was.

02:00:50.640 --> 02:00:54.300
If they do release that on PS3 in the future, which I hope they will, it's going to break

02:00:54.300 --> 02:00:57.080
down that, that border essentially.

02:00:57.080 --> 02:01:00.960
And if I want to just import it from a Japanese retailer, I'll be able to play it on my PS3.

02:01:00.960 --> 02:01:05.500
I won't have to spend another $400 on an extra place to, and yes, I spent like 400 bucks

02:01:05.500 --> 02:01:08.120
on a Japanese PS2 just so I could play the stupid game.

02:01:08.120 --> 02:01:10.040
Yeah, we, we did ours too.

02:01:10.040 --> 02:01:11.040
I know.

02:01:11.040 --> 02:01:12.040
Yeah.

02:01:12.040 --> 02:01:13.040
A lot of people did.

02:01:13.040 --> 02:01:14.040
It wasn't just me.

02:01:14.040 --> 02:01:16.260
I still have my old clunker at home.

02:01:16.260 --> 02:01:20.360
My wonderful, the original PS2 box.

02:01:20.360 --> 02:01:24.780
Props to those PS2s for holding up after all those years, cause I believe we heard a Bobby

02:01:24.780 --> 02:01:28.460
on the show right before us talking about his Xbox 360 red ringed.

02:01:28.460 --> 02:01:33.240
One of my friends just sent me a text over the weekend, my 360 red ringed frown face.

02:01:33.240 --> 02:01:34.600
They don't build them like they used to.

02:01:34.600 --> 02:01:35.600
No they don't.

02:01:35.600 --> 02:01:41.000
My PS2 is still up and going because I don't use it that much, mostly for DVDs, but yeah,

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:42.160
it still works.

02:01:42.160 --> 02:01:45.760
I'm not, I'm not real confident about Sony optical drives.

02:01:45.760 --> 02:01:48.080
Just bad experiences, but we'll see how long it lasts.

02:01:48.080 --> 02:01:49.640
So far, so good.

02:01:49.640 --> 02:01:52.200
Breslull's in our chat and says, I still want to get a JPS2.

02:01:52.200 --> 02:01:54.840
Well, the good news is it's really cheap now.

02:01:54.840 --> 02:01:59.560
You probably get it for only about a hundred now, maybe 120, 150 for Japanese PlayStation

02:01:59.560 --> 02:02:00.560
2.

02:02:00.560 --> 02:02:01.560
Yes.

02:02:01.560 --> 02:02:04.240
But keep in mind, if you import a console from Japan, it's only going to play the Japanese

02:02:04.240 --> 02:02:05.240
games.

02:02:05.240 --> 02:02:08.520
So there's gotta be something out there that you can't get here.

02:02:08.520 --> 02:02:09.800
Like dating Sims.

02:02:09.800 --> 02:02:15.480
All right, let's go to our mailbag.

02:02:15.480 --> 02:02:17.480
Let's see if some of the faces have changed in our mailbag.

02:02:17.480 --> 02:02:20.360
We're talking about some things never change.

02:02:20.360 --> 02:02:22.020
Let's see about the emails.

02:02:22.020 --> 02:02:24.400
Mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com if you want to send us an email.

02:02:24.400 --> 02:02:26.240
I think we've got quite a few this week, right, Jamie?

02:02:26.240 --> 02:02:28.000
Uh, a few more, yeah.

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:32.240
Hello, this is your friendly neighborhood Mexican, except in Arizona, act daft.

02:02:32.240 --> 02:02:35.200
First of all, very late congrats on your eighth anniversary.

02:02:35.200 --> 02:02:36.200
Keep up the good work.

02:02:36.200 --> 02:02:37.520
Thank you, sir.

02:02:37.520 --> 02:02:41.300
Now that I said that, I want to comment on some stuff you talked about on your last show.

02:02:41.300 --> 02:02:43.840
First about the Kinect and the move.

02:02:43.840 --> 02:02:45.800
You asked people if they're going to buy either of them.

02:02:45.800 --> 02:02:49.840
I'll probably get the Kinect later when it gets cheaper because I don't really, because

02:02:49.840 --> 02:02:53.760
I really want to try both Dance Central and Dance Master, and probably other games that

02:02:53.760 --> 02:02:56.120
Microsoft may release in the future.

02:02:56.120 --> 02:02:58.720
And Kinect does really look awesome.

02:02:58.720 --> 02:03:01.080
But the move, first of all, I don't own a PS3 yet.

02:03:01.080 --> 02:03:05.320
So before I get the move, I need a really good reason to get a PS3, which right now

02:03:05.320 --> 02:03:06.320
is nothing.

02:03:06.320 --> 02:03:11.360
Granted, there are a few PS3 exclusive games I do want, but they don't justify a reason

02:03:11.360 --> 02:03:12.840
to get the console.

02:03:12.840 --> 02:03:17.560
So before Sony tries to sell me a peripheral for any game at all, they should be working

02:03:17.560 --> 02:03:21.840
on selling me the console itself, because like Loki said, the move is just going to

02:03:21.840 --> 02:03:23.960
be the Wii with pretty graphics.

02:03:23.960 --> 02:03:26.620
And I already have a Wii that I barely use.

02:03:26.620 --> 02:03:32.680
I consider that their, excuse me, that their biggest problem and why the move may fail.

02:03:32.680 --> 02:03:36.600
And the PlayStation Network in Mexico and other Latin American countries sucks.

02:03:36.600 --> 02:03:41.160
Seriously, little to no content at all, and they want me to pay for a Plus service too?

02:03:41.160 --> 02:03:42.160
Yeah, right.

02:03:42.160 --> 02:03:45.320
Wow, this is a long email.

02:03:45.320 --> 02:03:48.160
Another thing that you discussed was controllers versus keyboards and mouse.

02:03:48.160 --> 02:03:51.720
I really think it comes down to what you're playing and how you're playing.

02:03:51.720 --> 02:03:55.160
For first person shooters, sure, keyboard and mouse are way better because of precision

02:03:55.160 --> 02:03:59.640
and other stuff, but for platformers or action games, I prefer controllers since it will

02:03:59.640 --> 02:04:03.720
give more comfort and allow you to do more stuff like jumping and attacking.

02:04:03.720 --> 02:04:07.680
I'm going to put two games as an example, Mirrors Edge and Psychonauts.

02:04:07.680 --> 02:04:11.720
Mirrors Edge, while you can play with a keyboard and mouse just fine, there are a lot of button

02:04:11.720 --> 02:04:15.480
combinations that are easier to do with a controller, and with Psychonauts, the game was designed

02:04:15.480 --> 02:04:19.960
for consoles, so the keyboard controls are just plain awkward.

02:04:19.960 --> 02:04:24.440
There are games that are easier with keyboard and mouse like Team Fortress 2 and Left 4 Dead,

02:04:24.440 --> 02:04:29.040
not to mention point and click adventures, western RPGs, strategy games, or MMOs.

02:04:29.040 --> 02:04:33.680
So I think you just need to learn both ways of controlling games and get the hang of both.

02:04:33.680 --> 02:04:37.000
There's no better way of playing games in general, just a more comfortable way to play

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:40.040
certain games, which I agree with, by the way.

02:04:40.040 --> 02:04:44.720
So that's all I want to say, thanks for reading, until next time, PS, sorry my lack of articles

02:04:44.720 --> 02:04:49.240
on the OLR main page, but no internet at home makes it difficult to do so, PSS, suck at

02:04:49.240 --> 02:04:51.640
Arizona and your racist laws.

02:04:51.640 --> 02:04:53.640
Deft is kabrown.

02:04:53.640 --> 02:05:02.200
Um, well, I think, especially the keyboard mouse part, I think a lot of the debate usually

02:05:02.200 --> 02:05:06.360
is around first person shooters, but definitely you bring up a good point about, you know,

02:05:06.360 --> 02:05:10.160
it really depends on the type of game you're playing, absolutely, is that keyboard mouse

02:05:10.160 --> 02:05:14.880
ain't gonna cut it, I think, as well for a game like Psychonauts, but for me, I don't

02:05:14.880 --> 02:05:17.920
know if it's because, I don't even know how to explain it.

02:05:17.920 --> 02:05:21.220
Like I used to play Quake just fine with keyboard and mouse, but some of these new games are

02:05:21.220 --> 02:05:26.600
just too many buttons, where, I know, I know, but yet when I hold a controller in my hand,

02:05:26.600 --> 02:05:27.600
it makes sense.

02:05:27.600 --> 02:05:30.360
I can't explain it, I don't expect anyone else to understand it, just the way it is

02:05:30.360 --> 02:05:31.360
for me.

02:05:31.360 --> 02:05:35.880
I'll tell you what's funny is that when I was playing PSO, I could not, I mean you can

02:05:35.880 --> 02:05:39.840
play it with a keyboard, it just was much more comfortable with a controller.

02:05:39.840 --> 02:05:42.880
But Final Fantasy XI, everyone was saying, why aren't you playing with a keyboard, why

02:05:42.880 --> 02:05:45.440
aren't you using a keyboard, why aren't you using a keyboard, I'm like, because I can

02:05:45.440 --> 02:05:47.440
do just fine with my controller.

02:05:47.440 --> 02:05:50.880
I wanted one for World of Warcraft, I hate playing World of Warcraft because I hate playing

02:05:50.880 --> 02:05:51.880
it on the keyboard.

02:05:51.880 --> 02:05:54.680
What about Star Trek Online, isn't that all keyboard?

02:05:54.680 --> 02:06:00.200
It is, but for some reason, it's, when you get into space combat, it really helps to

02:06:00.200 --> 02:06:02.880
have a mouse.

02:06:02.880 --> 02:06:04.200
Interesting.

02:06:04.200 --> 02:06:11.680
Because you can rotate your camera with it, as well as do direct targeting.

02:06:11.680 --> 02:06:16.640
As well as the difference between, you know, even different versions of the same game,

02:06:16.640 --> 02:06:20.120
like the different Wii versus, you know, PlayStation versions.

02:06:20.120 --> 02:06:24.840
Like I played the original PlayStation 2 version of Okami, yay!

02:06:24.840 --> 02:06:25.920
Fun game.

02:06:25.920 --> 02:06:32.700
And then I played the Wii re-release, and surprisingly, I liked the PlayStation 1 better.

02:06:32.700 --> 02:06:40.980
Because the Wii remote, I don't know what it was, it just felt more clunky.

02:06:40.980 --> 02:06:42.320
You know what I mean?

02:06:42.320 --> 02:06:48.480
It felt like it was rushed, it felt like it was, you know, it was, they were just trying

02:06:48.480 --> 02:06:53.440
to hurry it out as fast as they could, and they didn't bother with the calibration that

02:06:53.440 --> 02:06:56.460
they needed to make it good.

02:06:56.460 --> 02:06:58.120
With PlayStation 2, you don't have that problem.

02:06:58.120 --> 02:07:00.800
You do not have that problem with Okami.

02:07:00.800 --> 02:07:02.800
So.

02:07:02.800 --> 02:07:05.200
How about the next email?

02:07:05.200 --> 02:07:07.200
We're fond of calling it the Wii-mote.

02:07:07.200 --> 02:07:11.440
Instead of Wii remote, we call it the Wii-mote.

02:07:11.440 --> 02:07:12.440
Wii-mote?

02:07:12.440 --> 02:07:13.440
Wii-mote?

02:07:13.440 --> 02:07:14.440
Ok.

02:07:14.440 --> 02:07:15.440
I don't know this.

02:07:15.440 --> 02:07:17.440
I don't own one.

02:07:17.440 --> 02:07:20.320
Good morning, everyone.

02:07:20.320 --> 02:07:21.320
This is Jeet.

02:07:21.320 --> 02:07:22.320
It's the other Swede.

02:07:22.320 --> 02:07:24.320
Writing in once again.

02:07:24.320 --> 02:07:27.400
This time I'd like to comment a bit on the discussion that was brought forth last time

02:07:27.400 --> 02:07:30.840
concerning the accuracy and comfort when it comes to controllers.

02:07:30.840 --> 02:07:34.320
Now I could start a five page rant about why a mouse and keyboard is far superior to any

02:07:34.320 --> 02:07:36.800
console controllers, but I won't.

02:07:36.800 --> 02:07:41.080
The reason is that I am very biased, and due to that bias, I can't objectively say that

02:07:41.080 --> 02:07:42.440
a mouse is better.

02:07:42.440 --> 02:07:45.800
It's only a personal preference embedded in me during my childhood thanks to my uncle

02:07:45.800 --> 02:07:48.000
who introduced me to PC gaming.

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:52.040
It's simple, whatever controller you like, be it an Xbox 360 controller, PlayStation

02:07:52.040 --> 02:07:56.600
Move, or mouse, it's only the best peripheral for you personally, not the whole world and

02:07:56.600 --> 02:07:57.600
everyone in it.

02:07:57.600 --> 02:07:58.600
Thank you.

02:07:58.600 --> 02:08:04.600
To sum it up, the discussion of what control method is the quote best is pointless since

02:08:04.600 --> 02:08:07.720
it all comes down to what you are skilled at using or prefer.

02:08:07.720 --> 02:08:11.680
P.S. note that I didn't apologize for any spelling errors this time.

02:08:11.680 --> 02:08:15.120
That's because I realized it's rude for someone who grew up with English as their primary

02:08:15.120 --> 02:08:19.440
language to come into the minor flaws of someone who learned it as a second language.

02:08:19.440 --> 02:08:22.040
Let's see you typing a letter to me in Swedish without grammatical errors in it.

02:08:22.040 --> 02:08:23.760
I still love you, even you Dark Sakura.

02:08:23.760 --> 02:08:24.760
Aww.

02:08:24.760 --> 02:08:29.560
Anyway, if I know someone's typing from another country, I don't give them a hard time.

02:08:29.560 --> 02:08:30.560
If I know.

02:08:30.560 --> 02:08:32.560
If I don't, I'm sorry.

02:08:32.560 --> 02:08:33.560
P.S.S.

02:08:33.560 --> 02:08:35.880
Thanks for reading my letter and I hope your hand is feeling better.

02:08:35.880 --> 02:08:38.120
Thank you, but it's not.

02:08:38.120 --> 02:08:43.520
Drew Nami in our chatroom at chat.orangetownstrader.com says, IKEA controller for the Swedish email.

02:08:43.520 --> 02:08:44.520
There you go.

02:08:44.520 --> 02:08:45.520
Uh huh.

02:08:45.520 --> 02:08:46.520
Uh huh.

02:08:46.520 --> 02:08:50.320
And yeah, apparently it's international email night at Orange Island Radio, but hey, that's

02:08:50.320 --> 02:08:53.080
awesome to know that we have listeners all over the globe.

02:08:53.080 --> 02:08:54.080
That's so awesome.

02:08:54.080 --> 02:08:55.080
Alright.

02:08:55.080 --> 02:08:56.080
Next email.

02:08:56.080 --> 02:08:57.080
Hey Orange Lounge.

02:08:57.080 --> 02:08:58.080
Long time listener.

02:08:58.080 --> 02:08:59.080
First time responder.

02:08:59.080 --> 02:09:00.080
Oooh.

02:09:00.080 --> 02:09:01.560
We got the cliche.

02:09:01.560 --> 02:09:02.560
Love it.

02:09:02.560 --> 02:09:07.080
As for the move, personally I think it will be the better motion control option.

02:09:07.080 --> 02:09:11.360
Yes, the price point is high, but I think it will be the most accurate on the most powerful

02:09:11.360 --> 02:09:12.880
system of the three.

02:09:12.880 --> 02:09:17.120
I saw some great screen tests demonstrating its abilities and I think it could be a hardcore

02:09:17.120 --> 02:09:18.800
alternative to the Wii.

02:09:18.800 --> 02:09:20.400
That's the main reason I have avoided the Wii.

02:09:20.400 --> 02:09:22.080
It lacks the hardcore devotions.

02:09:22.080 --> 02:09:23.080
No five.

02:09:23.080 --> 02:09:29.600
Just playing devil's advocate to your email, I kind of get that perspective and that's

02:09:29.600 --> 02:09:34.040
why a lot of people have avoided the Wii, but what about games like Brawl and Metroid

02:09:34.040 --> 02:09:36.960
Other M and some of these other kind of like, and GoldenEye, some of these are the cool

02:09:36.960 --> 02:09:40.800
things that are on the Wii, I mean is that not hardcore enough?

02:09:40.800 --> 02:09:41.800
No more heroes?

02:09:41.800 --> 02:09:47.040
Yeah, I mean, I don't know, it's kind of like, it feels like there's some cool stuff on the

02:09:47.040 --> 02:09:51.240
Wii, I mean granted maybe not as much, and yeah, Wii kind of made some errors when it

02:09:51.240 --> 02:09:55.720
comes to not being online, I think that's one of their biggest flaws is that the multiplayer

02:09:55.720 --> 02:10:00.120
online is just a joke, you know, compared to what else is out there.

02:10:00.120 --> 02:10:02.640
I agree.

02:10:02.640 --> 02:10:04.280
But appreciate the perspective.

02:10:04.280 --> 02:10:05.760
We have two more emails to go.

02:10:05.760 --> 02:10:06.760
No!

02:10:06.760 --> 02:10:07.760
Too bad!

02:10:07.760 --> 02:10:10.800
Hello, OLR, I have been listening for about three months and I love the show, although

02:10:10.800 --> 02:10:14.560
I must admit that I'm not a music game person myself, I'd much rather RPGs but teach their

02:10:14.560 --> 02:10:15.560
own.

02:10:15.560 --> 02:10:17.000
I'm dropping this to you for three reasons.

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:20.600
First I was wondering what job Loki has that he's able to play Xbox at work.

02:10:20.600 --> 02:10:21.600
Would love that job.

02:10:21.600 --> 02:10:25.120
Second, he's not using any periods by the way.

02:10:25.120 --> 02:10:28.240
Oh, that's why you sound like an auctioneer.

02:10:28.240 --> 02:10:29.240
Yes.

02:10:29.240 --> 02:10:32.680
Second is I was wondering if there was a way to get the livestream via mobile platform,

02:10:32.680 --> 02:10:33.680
i.e. a moto-droid.

02:10:33.680 --> 02:10:39.320
Third, is actually two things in the first letting, being that Dark Soccer is a fiend

02:10:39.320 --> 02:10:42.320
for grammar, spelling, and punctuation, I thought it might interest her to know that

02:10:42.320 --> 02:10:47.080
this site has lasted, has several, lastly I wonder what point during this email she

02:10:47.080 --> 02:10:49.040
stops reading this and starts to have convulsions.

02:10:49.040 --> 02:10:53.080
As I've written this without punctuation and have made several misspellings and several

02:10:53.080 --> 02:10:56.520
grammatical errors on purpose, not that I don't like her or anything, I just thought

02:10:56.520 --> 02:10:59.920
that it might get a giggle, good times all and keep up the good work.

02:10:59.920 --> 02:11:07.120
I had to figure, I figured by then it was, hey you did, you did use a punctuation mark.

02:11:07.120 --> 02:11:11.120
You gotta laugh out of me anytime somebody writes in to give Dark Soccer some shit, I

02:11:11.120 --> 02:11:12.120
love it.

02:11:12.120 --> 02:11:16.760
No, I'm laughing at this because I realized by that point that it was on purpose.

02:11:16.760 --> 02:11:19.120
So this is a punctuation troll.

02:11:19.120 --> 02:11:24.680
Wow, we have our first grammar troll on Orange Lounge Radio, that's awesome.

02:11:24.680 --> 02:11:25.680
You get a gold star.

02:11:25.680 --> 02:11:26.680
You totally get a gold star.

02:11:26.680 --> 02:11:30.920
And this is from Kane I Am, I didn't sign it but I'm taking it from the email.

02:11:30.920 --> 02:11:35.640
Kane I Am, you get a gold star for being the first grammar troll at Orange Lounge Radio.

02:11:35.640 --> 02:11:38.440
And the subject of the subject is Wee Yay Wahoo.

02:11:38.440 --> 02:11:42.400
Please, that is not encouraging others to copy what this gentleman has done.

02:11:42.400 --> 02:11:46.480
Yeah, because if you do it the first time, you're clever, anyone who does it the second

02:11:46.480 --> 02:11:47.480
time is stupid.

02:11:47.480 --> 02:11:50.120
Alright, what was the real question here though?

02:11:50.120 --> 02:11:53.040
There was something in there I actually wanted to answer that had come up in there.

02:11:53.040 --> 02:11:54.440
Oh, Loki's Job.

02:11:54.440 --> 02:11:55.880
He works for a game distributor.

02:11:55.880 --> 02:12:02.480
So he actually, like he's kind of the middle man between gaming companies and the actual

02:12:02.480 --> 02:12:03.480
stores.

02:12:03.480 --> 02:12:04.480
Yeah.

02:12:04.480 --> 02:12:09.320
Because it's very hard for a gaming company to manage all these stores directly, so they

02:12:09.320 --> 02:12:11.720
use distributors to kind of be the middle men.

02:12:11.720 --> 02:12:14.400
And that's basically what he does, he works for the distributor.

02:12:14.400 --> 02:12:16.320
And then there was something right after that about...

02:12:16.320 --> 02:12:19.680
About being able to listen to us on mobile, because he's got a Moto Droid 3rd.

02:12:19.680 --> 02:12:20.680
Okay, I...

02:12:20.680 --> 02:12:22.680
Sorry, a Moto Droid.

02:12:22.680 --> 02:12:25.160
We have, well I know that for iPhone we use apps.

02:12:25.160 --> 02:12:31.640
There's an all games app on the iPhone supposedly, but I guess it disappeared this week, so I

02:12:31.640 --> 02:12:33.480
don't know what's going on there.

02:12:33.480 --> 02:12:37.040
That's a Scott question, not a Rob question, so I don't know.

02:12:37.040 --> 02:12:41.880
But I will say this, any program that can use Shoutcast can listen to the all game stream.

02:12:41.880 --> 02:12:45.440
You just have to get the link for the Shoutcast feed, it's a little silly for me to yell it

02:12:45.440 --> 02:12:46.440
out here.

02:12:46.440 --> 02:12:49.200
I think Pandora has a...

02:12:49.200 --> 02:12:50.200
Go to all...

02:12:50.200 --> 02:12:51.200
Well Pandora's...

02:12:51.200 --> 02:12:52.200
Does it have Shoutcast mode in it though?

02:12:52.200 --> 02:12:53.200
I don't know.

02:12:53.200 --> 02:12:54.200
I don't know.

02:12:54.200 --> 02:12:58.000
But most mobile phones have some type of Shoutcast tuner app, I mean anything that's like, listen

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:01.640
to thousands of internet radio stations, it's probably a Shoutcast app.

02:13:01.640 --> 02:13:06.320
And if you go to allgames.com you can get the link to listen to all games radio.

02:13:06.320 --> 02:13:07.320
Yeah.

02:13:07.320 --> 02:13:08.320
Pretty easy.

02:13:08.320 --> 02:13:11.680
Okay, and then the grammar thing.

02:13:11.680 --> 02:13:15.000
Which I'm laughing, I'm actually laughing, because I realized it was on purpose.

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:16.000
How funny, Tiger...

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:18.720
I'm sorry, I have to say this, Tigercall on our chatroom is saying since the all games

02:13:18.720 --> 02:13:22.880
app isn't up right now, you can get the Video Game Outsiders iPhone app, because they're

02:13:22.880 --> 02:13:25.420
another show on the network, they do Tuesdays here.

02:13:25.420 --> 02:13:28.440
And I guess their app does it.

02:13:28.440 --> 02:13:29.440
That's cool.

02:13:29.440 --> 02:13:31.160
So, I guess a backup.

02:13:31.160 --> 02:13:35.480
Okay, and the last one.

02:13:35.480 --> 02:13:37.760
Greetings OLR, Rini here.

02:13:37.760 --> 02:13:42.020
I will soon be the proud owner of a new Beatles Rock Band limited edition bundle that I scored

02:13:42.020 --> 02:13:43.020
for 20 bucks.

02:13:43.020 --> 02:13:44.020
Wow.

02:13:44.020 --> 02:13:48.400
I have not owned a Rock Band game until now, so I was wondering if you and the listeners

02:13:48.400 --> 02:13:54.400
could give any advice on what I should know about keeping my gear in great condition.

02:13:54.400 --> 02:14:00.160
I would say, sanitize it if other people play it.

02:14:00.160 --> 02:14:03.400
Especially if they have greasy fingers.

02:14:03.400 --> 02:14:06.320
Or liquor is being mixed with those controllers.

02:14:06.320 --> 02:14:07.320
Seriously.

02:14:07.320 --> 02:14:14.400
Yes, those monitor wipes that you can use to clean your computer screen, those might

02:14:14.400 --> 02:14:15.480
be good for it.

02:14:15.480 --> 02:14:18.080
Alcohol prep pads, yo.

02:14:18.080 --> 02:14:19.440
Because alcohol just dries.

02:14:19.440 --> 02:14:21.600
Clorox wipes are like the greatest invention ever.

02:14:21.600 --> 02:14:23.040
Yeah, but you gotta be careful with those.

02:14:23.040 --> 02:14:25.480
That's true, you don't want to bleach your controllers like a sister.

02:14:25.480 --> 02:14:29.600
The horrible thing is, when you said, you know, if alcohol is being mixed with us drinks,

02:14:29.600 --> 02:14:36.360
I got this horrible mental image of a Rock Band controller mixing a giant vat of alcohol.

02:14:36.360 --> 02:14:38.520
I wouldn't use it for that purpose.

02:14:38.520 --> 02:14:42.160
You must hate your Rock Band if you're doing that, wow.

02:14:42.160 --> 02:14:48.760
And also, when you store them, make sure that you don't have them stacked up haphazardly.

02:14:48.760 --> 02:14:54.600
We usually stand ours up on end and put them in a corner to where they won't really fall

02:14:54.600 --> 02:14:55.600
on each other.

02:14:55.600 --> 02:14:58.280
If you really want to take good care of them, and this is the way to do it, just go get

02:14:58.280 --> 02:15:01.500
one of those big plastic storage tubs at Target.

02:15:01.500 --> 02:15:03.320
It would cost you only a couple bucks.

02:15:03.320 --> 02:15:06.840
IKEA would have them too, any place ought to have it.

02:15:06.840 --> 02:15:12.320
You can just get a big storage tub and put your drum kit and your guitar in there, and

02:15:12.320 --> 02:15:17.000
then that way it won't get a crap ton of dust on it, it won't be left out to be kicked and

02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:18.560
pushed around and fall over.

02:15:18.560 --> 02:15:23.320
With all my Baymani stuff, we would typically just put them back in the box.

02:15:23.320 --> 02:15:24.320
That's dedication.

02:15:24.320 --> 02:15:28.840
I don't know if, especially I think the guitar is in pieces in the Rock Band box, I want

02:15:28.840 --> 02:15:29.840
to say.

02:15:29.840 --> 02:15:30.840
I don't know if I'd want to put it back together.

02:15:30.840 --> 02:15:35.560
We can do that with our Rock Band ones, but for the ones that we could, we would do that.

02:15:35.560 --> 02:15:38.280
Plastic tubs, if you have the space for it, would be great.

02:15:38.280 --> 02:15:42.520
Of course I will be getting Rock Band, Rock Band 2, and Lego Rock Band very soon, so please

02:15:42.520 --> 02:15:45.960
kindly randomly blurt out any good download content songs.

02:15:45.960 --> 02:15:46.960
Thanks.

02:15:46.960 --> 02:15:47.960
P.S.

02:15:47.960 --> 02:15:49.720
Give Dark Sakura more ginger ale, dude.

02:15:49.720 --> 02:15:52.160
Don't stop believin'.

02:15:52.160 --> 02:15:53.160
Is really all you need.

02:15:53.160 --> 02:15:55.120
Skullcrusher Mountain.

02:15:55.120 --> 02:15:57.400
Definitely look for the free stuff on the marketplace.

02:15:57.400 --> 02:15:58.640
Jonathan Coulton stuff.

02:15:58.640 --> 02:16:00.440
It's really about what type of music you're into.

02:16:00.440 --> 02:16:02.960
And Stephen Colbert.

02:16:02.960 --> 02:16:03.960
Lady Gaga.

02:16:03.960 --> 02:16:04.960
Blah.

02:16:04.960 --> 02:16:05.960
Blah yourself.

02:16:05.960 --> 02:16:06.960
Haters.

02:16:06.960 --> 02:16:07.960
Haters.

02:16:07.960 --> 02:16:08.960
Haters.

02:16:08.960 --> 02:16:09.960
We're not...

02:16:09.960 --> 02:16:10.960
Haters gonna hate, Rob.

02:16:10.960 --> 02:16:11.960
Haters gonna hate.

02:16:11.960 --> 02:16:12.960
That's right.

02:16:12.960 --> 02:16:13.960
Oh boy.

02:16:13.960 --> 02:16:14.960
That's it.

02:16:14.960 --> 02:16:15.960
You can't...

02:16:15.960 --> 02:16:16.960
Stop the hate.

02:16:16.960 --> 02:16:17.960
That's right.

02:16:17.960 --> 02:16:22.360
I have actually said this, Rob, and I made this statement clear when we went out to Vick's

02:16:22.360 --> 02:16:28.600
Ice Cream downtown, that I do not dislike Lady Gaga.

02:16:28.600 --> 02:16:33.920
I dislike the radio versions of her songs, but every time I've heard piano versions,

02:16:33.920 --> 02:16:35.560
I've really liked them.

02:16:35.560 --> 02:16:36.560
Okay.

02:16:36.560 --> 02:16:37.560
Okay.

02:16:37.560 --> 02:16:38.560
So, it's...

02:16:38.560 --> 02:16:39.560
No one-ker.

02:16:39.560 --> 02:16:45.680
I thought you just disliked the performance art aspects of her videos.

02:16:45.680 --> 02:16:46.680
Videos get you...

02:16:46.680 --> 02:16:50.200
Well, I don't like her videos, but I mean, I like the video for Alejandro.

02:16:50.200 --> 02:16:53.360
I don't like the videos, but the songs are pretty awesome.

02:16:53.360 --> 02:16:54.360
I like video games.

02:16:54.360 --> 02:16:55.360
All right, let's...

02:16:55.360 --> 02:16:56.480
Yes, let's go on.

02:16:56.480 --> 02:16:57.880
I also like Angst.

02:16:57.880 --> 02:17:02.360
What a perfect segue into our FUs of the week.

02:17:02.360 --> 02:17:04.360
Yay.

02:17:04.360 --> 02:17:20.280
And now, for those new to Orange Lounge Radio, this is the part of the show where we just

02:17:20.280 --> 02:17:24.960
say a big FU to whatever we're going to say an FU to all week, Dark Soccer.

02:17:24.960 --> 02:17:30.520
FU to the hole in my hand, and to my husband's blood pressure.

02:17:30.520 --> 02:17:36.040
We're going to beat you, butthead, okay.

02:17:36.040 --> 02:17:40.400
I'm going to give an FU to all the sand in my hypothetical vagina that I apparently have

02:17:40.400 --> 02:17:41.400
today.

02:17:41.400 --> 02:17:42.400
I just...

02:17:42.400 --> 02:17:46.880
Are you feeling a little gritty and not so fresh?

02:17:46.880 --> 02:17:48.880
Yes.

02:17:48.880 --> 02:17:56.200
I have to say a big FU to any gaming company who is willing to charge multiple dollars

02:17:56.200 --> 02:17:59.120
for copies of games that I already own.

02:17:59.120 --> 02:18:03.600
Yes, I'm talking to you, PlayStation.

02:18:03.600 --> 02:18:10.000
Okay, the biggest FU, well, general FUs all around to...

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:11.720
Let's see, the list is long and distinguished.

02:18:11.720 --> 02:18:12.720
We'll keep it short.

02:18:12.720 --> 02:18:18.240
Fox News, Sarah Palin, Meg Whitman, boo!

02:18:18.240 --> 02:18:19.240
Carly Fiona?

02:18:19.240 --> 02:18:20.240
Oh God, no.

02:18:20.240 --> 02:18:21.480
I thought you were keeping it short.

02:18:21.480 --> 02:18:23.680
Yeah, yeah, I am keeping it short.

02:18:23.680 --> 02:18:28.280
And the whole Republican Party, go rot, FU.

02:18:28.280 --> 02:18:29.920
That won't generate any emails tonight.

02:18:29.920 --> 02:18:34.240
By the way, by the way, by the way, Rob, as an official woman, you can have an honorary

02:18:34.240 --> 02:18:35.240
veg.

02:18:35.240 --> 02:18:38.360
Oh yay, just I've always wanted...

02:18:38.360 --> 02:18:39.880
You can keep it.

02:18:39.880 --> 02:18:41.760
These things are nothing but trouble.

02:18:41.760 --> 02:18:46.800
So you don't have to have a hypothetical one, you can have an honorary one.

02:18:46.800 --> 02:18:47.800
I don't want one.

02:18:47.800 --> 02:18:48.800
What's the difference?

02:18:48.800 --> 02:18:49.800
I...

02:18:49.800 --> 02:18:50.800
They're both non-existent.

02:18:50.800 --> 02:18:54.520
Send it back, return to sender.

02:18:54.520 --> 02:18:55.520
The warranty experience, sorry.

02:18:55.520 --> 02:18:56.520
Do not want.

02:18:56.520 --> 02:19:01.120
Rob's pet vag.

02:19:01.120 --> 02:19:02.120
My little vag.

02:19:02.120 --> 02:19:05.800
Hmm, there's a product idea for Hasbro.

02:19:05.800 --> 02:19:06.800
What?

02:19:06.800 --> 02:19:08.800
Imagine vagina.

02:19:08.800 --> 02:19:15.400
All right, anyhow, let's move on.

02:19:15.400 --> 02:19:19.920
Loki is in our chat room right now, he's in the chat, he joined on the hospital Wi-Fi.

02:19:19.920 --> 02:19:20.920
He's in chat right now.

02:19:20.920 --> 02:19:23.080
Woot for free Wi-Fi, I second that.

02:19:23.080 --> 02:19:27.520
I don't know if he's listening or what, I just sent him a private message if I can call

02:19:27.520 --> 02:19:30.920
him, but I don't know if he can see, he probably can't hear.

02:19:30.920 --> 02:19:37.920
Free slow Wi-Fi, that's what you get when it's free Wi-Fi, it's slow Wi-Fi.

02:19:37.920 --> 02:19:41.200
I don't know, so we'll see if we can call him or not, we'll see.

02:19:41.200 --> 02:19:43.400
But for now we're gonna keep on moving with the news.

02:19:43.400 --> 02:19:49.120
Ah, let's see, Metroid Other M, now here's a Wii game that's gonna be pretty hardcore

02:19:49.120 --> 02:19:53.160
for that person earlier, but yeah, I'm excited about this game, I'm finally gonna dust off

02:19:53.160 --> 02:19:55.400
the Wii after like six months of not playing it.

02:19:55.400 --> 02:19:58.500
This is kind of an interesting mode they're putting in the game, it's gonna be a theater

02:19:58.500 --> 02:20:04.640
mode in Metroid Other M. That's right, if you wanna just watch the movie Metroid Other

02:20:04.640 --> 02:20:06.600
M, you can do that.

02:20:06.600 --> 02:20:11.080
That's right, there's a theater mode according to one of the designers at Nintendo, Yoshio

02:20:11.080 --> 02:20:14.920
Sakamoto, there's a theater mode that lets you view all of the cutscenes linked together

02:20:14.920 --> 02:20:17.160
seamlessly as a single movie.

02:20:17.160 --> 02:20:20.840
We placed just as much weight on enjoying the story as we did on the action aspects

02:20:20.840 --> 02:20:25.520
of the game, but it's hard to fully communicate a storyline in a video game with just one

02:20:25.520 --> 02:20:26.520
playthrough.

02:20:26.520 --> 02:20:30.400
At the same time though, it's asking a lot of players to beat the game twice to get it

02:20:30.400 --> 02:20:33.280
all, so that's where the idea for that mode came from.

02:20:33.280 --> 02:20:36.960
It lets you make a lot of discoveries, things you missed, or dialogue that makes more sense

02:20:36.960 --> 02:20:38.160
in retrospect.

02:20:38.160 --> 02:20:42.040
I hope it helps people understand the story better.

02:20:42.040 --> 02:20:43.040
Interesting approach.

02:20:43.040 --> 02:20:44.040
Nice!

02:20:44.040 --> 02:20:51.280
That almost kind of reminds me of Final Fantasy X, they had the theater that was in Luka that

02:20:51.280 --> 02:20:55.320
you could go to and buy the individual cutscenes, which was really nice when you wanted to look

02:20:55.320 --> 02:20:56.320
at them all together.

02:20:56.320 --> 02:20:59.480
Yeah, and I was gonna say, people have been kind of doing this whole cutscene movie thing

02:20:59.480 --> 02:21:04.380
for years, like I'm pretty sure I could probably go on YouTube and just see nothing but cutscenes

02:21:04.380 --> 02:21:08.240
from some of the more recent Final Fantasy games, get a pretty good sense of what the

02:21:08.240 --> 02:21:09.240
story's all about.

02:21:09.240 --> 02:21:13.640
So, kind of interesting that the game is now officially endorsing that idea, but I like

02:21:13.640 --> 02:21:15.280
his reasoning behind it.

02:21:15.280 --> 02:21:18.120
He's just kind of like, you know what, you shouldn't have to beat the game twice to get

02:21:18.120 --> 02:21:20.320
everything.

02:21:20.320 --> 02:21:25.660
And you might kind of go, it's Nintendo Easy Mode, just hit the button or whatever, but

02:21:25.660 --> 02:21:29.880
you know, I'll give him a little credit.

02:21:29.880 --> 02:21:33.120
I think something as epic as Metroid is worthy of a theater mode.

02:21:33.120 --> 02:21:37.360
So is it cheating if you watch the whole movie first and then you play the game?

02:21:37.360 --> 02:21:41.480
Yes, but in my opinion that's no worse than going on the internet and reading the entire

02:21:41.480 --> 02:21:42.960
FAQ before you play the game.

02:21:42.960 --> 02:21:43.960
Good point.

02:21:43.960 --> 02:21:44.960
Yeah, true.

02:21:44.960 --> 02:21:46.440
I mean, is it really any worse?

02:21:46.440 --> 02:21:50.280
So, I'm okay with it.

02:21:50.280 --> 02:21:53.560
Let's see, Tigerclaw says, now the question is how long is the theater mode?

02:21:53.560 --> 02:21:56.600
Usually cutscenes, when you add them all together, they aren't usually an hour.

02:21:56.600 --> 02:21:58.340
They're saying two hours.

02:21:58.340 --> 02:22:01.540
Two hours is divided into chapters just like a DVD.

02:22:01.540 --> 02:22:08.480
It's not just the cutscenes, there's actually prerecorded gameplay that will be intertwined

02:22:08.480 --> 02:22:09.480
with it.

02:22:09.480 --> 02:22:14.920
Although, I guess at one point they wanted to actually have recorded bits of you playing

02:22:14.920 --> 02:22:19.440
the game that would then go into theater mode, but it's too big of a pain in the ass, basically,

02:22:19.440 --> 02:22:20.440
and I'll tell you why.

02:22:20.440 --> 02:22:22.920
It's because there's no decent storage on the Wii.

02:22:22.920 --> 02:22:25.360
Even though it's not what they're saying, I'm totally filling in the gaps there and

02:22:25.360 --> 02:22:27.640
making it up, it's got to be the reason.

02:22:27.640 --> 02:22:29.020
You can't store that information.

02:22:29.020 --> 02:22:31.160
But it is watching an actual movie.

02:22:31.160 --> 02:22:32.160
Pretty much.

02:22:32.160 --> 02:22:33.160
That's kind of cool.

02:22:33.160 --> 02:22:34.160
That's nice.

02:22:34.160 --> 02:22:35.160
I mean, how many people are perfectly content?

02:22:35.160 --> 02:22:39.760
DarkSakura comes in here and a lot of her gaming weeks usually are, I watched Dan play

02:22:39.760 --> 02:22:40.760
blank.

02:22:40.760 --> 02:22:44.040
There's a lot of people that game by watching other people game.

02:22:44.040 --> 02:22:49.200
Well, yeah, I mean, part of it for me is that he'll play a lot of single player stuff and

02:22:49.200 --> 02:22:53.480
loves to just, you know, completely dominate the front room.

02:22:53.480 --> 02:22:57.440
So usually if I'm out there and he's playing something, it's just me watching him play

02:22:57.440 --> 02:22:58.440
something.

02:22:58.440 --> 02:22:59.980
Especially now since I had my hand surgery.

02:22:59.980 --> 02:23:03.520
You know, I really get a lot of enjoyment out of just sitting down watching him play.

02:23:03.520 --> 02:23:08.760
Like I could sit and watch him play Grand Theft Horse for a while because it was very

02:23:08.760 --> 02:23:09.760
cinematic.

02:23:09.760 --> 02:23:11.800
Isn't watching games boring?

02:23:11.800 --> 02:23:12.800
No.

02:23:12.800 --> 02:23:13.800
No.

02:23:13.800 --> 02:23:14.800
It's like watching a movie.

02:23:14.800 --> 02:23:18.840
Actually, I have a DVD that's all the cut scenes of Final Fantasy X-2.

02:23:18.840 --> 02:23:21.600
Alan will watch me PVP and wow and he enjoys it.

02:23:21.600 --> 02:23:24.560
Of course, he likes to play backseat driver too, but that's okay.

02:23:24.560 --> 02:23:25.560
It's fun.

02:23:25.560 --> 02:23:26.560
I like doing that.

02:23:26.560 --> 02:23:27.560
It's cool.

02:23:27.560 --> 02:23:34.080
Alright, um, Dark Sakura, one more story and then I've got one more story as well and then

02:23:34.080 --> 02:23:37.840
we're going to get to the phones, 877 game OLR in just a moment.

02:23:37.840 --> 02:23:41.120
It's kind of funny because this is something I downloaded and never got a chance to play.

02:23:41.120 --> 02:23:43.360
I was actually sitting here trying to play it.

02:23:43.360 --> 02:23:49.040
Um, it was the Gorillaz Escape to Plastic Beach, which is on iPad and iPhone.

02:23:49.040 --> 02:23:50.040
Oh, nice.

02:23:50.040 --> 02:23:51.040
And, uh.

02:23:51.040 --> 02:23:52.040
Good band.

02:23:52.040 --> 02:23:53.040
What's that about?

02:23:53.040 --> 02:23:59.640
Well, it's basically, it's them trying to get to the Plastic Beach and, like, you either

02:23:59.640 --> 02:24:07.120
play, you play Murdock who flies on a Doom Glider and, um, he's trying to keep 2D from

02:24:07.120 --> 02:24:08.120
escaping.

02:24:08.120 --> 02:24:09.120
Nice.

02:24:09.120 --> 02:24:17.480
You know, so it's, uh, it's only $1.99 and, um, you can get it as a browser game too.

02:24:17.480 --> 02:24:19.640
So, uh, it's pretty cute.

02:24:19.640 --> 02:24:21.520
Like, here, let me, let me start it up again.

02:24:21.520 --> 02:24:26.600
I know this is fantastic cause you won't probably be able to hear it very well, but, um.

02:24:26.600 --> 02:24:27.840
It seems interesting to me though.

02:24:27.840 --> 02:24:31.980
I mean, usually these are the type of things you put out before an album comes out to kind

02:24:31.980 --> 02:24:34.060
of raise awareness about it.

02:24:34.060 --> 02:24:36.680
So it's a little weird that this is coming out now.

02:24:36.680 --> 02:24:40.360
Is this picking up?

02:24:40.360 --> 02:24:41.360
Very quietly.

02:24:41.360 --> 02:24:44.080
Most of our listeners probably won't be able to hear it very well.

02:24:44.080 --> 02:24:48.200
Headphone people will probably be able to hear it okay, but speaker people probably

02:24:48.200 --> 02:24:49.200
not.

02:24:49.200 --> 02:24:50.200
Yeah.

02:24:50.200 --> 02:24:53.440
I'm trying to let you hear the beginning of it.

02:24:53.440 --> 02:24:54.440
It's loading.

02:24:54.440 --> 02:24:55.440
It's just beep, beep, boops.

02:24:55.440 --> 02:24:57.440
Oh, we can hear it there a little bit.

02:24:57.440 --> 02:25:01.440
I need to get away.

02:25:01.440 --> 02:25:04.440
Oh, I'm so British.

02:25:04.440 --> 02:25:08.760
He's left a key in your car.

02:25:08.760 --> 02:25:10.760
Catch me if you can.

02:25:10.760 --> 02:25:15.720
Oh, are you running a Monty Python skit on your iPhone?

02:25:15.720 --> 02:25:18.760
That's what it sounds like a little bit, doesn't it?

02:25:18.760 --> 02:25:19.760
So cute.

02:25:19.760 --> 02:25:23.600
It is actually the actual voice actors and everything.

02:25:23.600 --> 02:25:24.600
Nice.

02:25:24.600 --> 02:25:26.600
Making more money off the characters, but hey, you know what?

02:25:26.600 --> 02:25:30.680
If they can have Britney Spears apps and sing along to Lady Tap Tap Bieber or whatever those

02:25:30.680 --> 02:25:31.680
games are.

02:25:31.680 --> 02:25:34.280
She's such a cute little girl.

02:25:34.280 --> 02:25:35.280
Who?

02:25:35.280 --> 02:25:36.280
Justine Bieber.

02:25:36.280 --> 02:25:37.280
That's awesome.

02:25:37.280 --> 02:25:41.360
I was like, who are you talking about?

02:25:41.360 --> 02:25:42.360
Britney Spears?

02:25:42.360 --> 02:25:43.360
She's not a little girl anymore.

02:25:43.360 --> 02:25:44.360
No, Justine Bieber.

02:25:44.360 --> 02:25:45.360
Oh, Justine Bieber.

02:25:45.360 --> 02:25:46.360
Okay.

02:25:46.360 --> 02:25:48.360
She's the cutest little lesbian, I swear.

02:25:48.360 --> 02:25:54.360
I'm a big Gorillaz fan, so this is so cute, but man, though looking at the iPad version

02:25:54.360 --> 02:25:57.400
though, I'd really love to play the iPad one.

02:25:57.400 --> 02:25:58.400
It looks like fun.

02:25:58.400 --> 02:26:01.440
It looks very much like a Murdoch is Doom Glider.

02:26:01.440 --> 02:26:05.840
One more story for you guys about a guy who now will have plenty of money to develop games

02:26:05.840 --> 02:26:06.840
on the iPad.

02:26:06.840 --> 02:26:11.720
If he chooses to Richard Garriott, he is the guy that made Ultima many, many years

02:26:11.720 --> 02:26:12.720
ago.

02:26:12.720 --> 02:26:13.720
Remember Ultima?

02:26:13.720 --> 02:26:14.720
It was epic epicness.

02:26:14.720 --> 02:26:15.720
It was an awesome, awesome.

02:26:15.720 --> 02:26:17.880
I know I spent a lot of time playing Ultima Exodus.

02:26:17.880 --> 02:26:23.320
He made a game a little less successful called Tabula Rasa a couple of years ago.

02:26:23.320 --> 02:26:24.320
Remember that?

02:26:24.320 --> 02:26:31.320
Well, Tabula Rasa closed of course, and NCsoft was the company behind Tabula Rasa and Richard

02:26:31.320 --> 02:26:34.560
Garriott was not happy with the way things went.

02:26:34.560 --> 02:26:42.240
In fact, he sued NCsoft for fraud, breach of contract, misrepresentation because he's

02:26:42.240 --> 02:26:46.400
saying he didn't voluntarily leave the company as NCsoft claimed.

02:26:46.400 --> 02:26:47.400
Ooh.

02:26:47.400 --> 02:26:48.400
Well, here's the deal.

02:26:48.400 --> 02:26:52.400
Apparently, it came out today that out of the 47 million that Richard Garriott was

02:26:52.400 --> 02:26:56.240
seeking, he was actually awarded $28 million.

02:26:56.240 --> 02:26:57.240
Touching.

02:26:57.240 --> 02:26:58.240
Yikes.

02:26:58.240 --> 02:26:59.480
So, there you go.

02:26:59.480 --> 02:27:02.960
Apparently, they did find that there was some misrepresentation going on there and some

02:27:02.960 --> 02:27:07.640
contracts were breached and so forth.

02:27:07.640 --> 02:27:08.680
Very unfortunate.

02:27:08.680 --> 02:27:09.680
You know what's unfortunate?

02:27:09.680 --> 02:27:13.000
That was that NCsoft makes a lot of... I hope they have good insurance, like legal

02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:19.000
insurance or something because they make a lot of MMOs and hopefully this won't hit them

02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:23.560
in the pockets really hard because they've got a lot of stuff under development at NCsoft

02:27:23.560 --> 02:27:24.560
right now.

02:27:24.560 --> 02:27:27.280
This is going to suck that they're going to have to pay this guy out $28 million because

02:27:27.280 --> 02:27:33.160
they screwed up some things.

02:27:33.160 --> 02:27:34.960
Tabula Rasa was an interesting game.

02:27:34.960 --> 02:27:36.040
It's kind of a bummer.

02:27:36.040 --> 02:27:37.320
It got kind of a crappy break.

02:27:37.320 --> 02:27:38.320
I don't know.

02:27:38.320 --> 02:27:40.640
It shouldn't... Maybe they just didn't promote it well enough.

02:27:40.640 --> 02:27:41.640
I don't know.

02:27:41.640 --> 02:27:43.960
Nothing was able to beat WoW at that time.

02:27:43.960 --> 02:27:44.960
I don't know.

02:27:44.960 --> 02:27:46.600
But, there it is.

02:27:46.600 --> 02:27:47.600
All right.

02:27:47.600 --> 02:27:52.800
We are going to go ahead and open up the Skype line if you want to give us a call at 1-877-GAME-OLR

02:27:52.800 --> 02:27:55.720
or our username on Skype is ORANGELOUNGERADIO.

02:27:55.720 --> 02:27:59.680
Go ahead and give us a call and we'll take a few calls before we end the show, close

02:27:59.680 --> 02:28:05.080
up shop tonight, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username is ORANGELOUNGERADIO.

02:28:05.080 --> 02:28:10.880
I was hoping Loki would call us but I guess his Wi-Fi at the hospital is not so great.

02:28:10.880 --> 02:28:14.160
He's not getting the private messages but that's okay.

02:28:14.160 --> 02:28:16.640
He's got better things to do than talk to us, honestly.

02:28:16.640 --> 02:28:20.360
I know we're his friends and everything but he's got more important stuff tonight.

02:28:20.360 --> 02:28:21.560
It's all good.

02:28:21.560 --> 02:28:24.360
It's all good.

02:28:24.360 --> 02:28:27.360
We should try to take the mics on the road and go see the baby.

02:28:27.360 --> 02:28:28.360
That would be fun.

02:28:28.360 --> 02:28:29.360
That would be absolutely cute.

02:28:29.360 --> 02:28:33.000
At the same time, everybody probably wants to be left the fuck alone right now.

02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:38.320
Keep in mind, for the next month, all this baby is going to be able to see is blur, blur,

02:28:38.320 --> 02:28:39.320
blur.

02:28:39.320 --> 02:28:40.480
Ooh, red.

02:28:40.480 --> 02:28:41.480
But you like blur.

02:28:41.480 --> 02:28:42.480
They're a great band.

02:28:42.480 --> 02:28:43.480
Yeah.

02:28:43.480 --> 02:28:44.480
Dork.

02:28:44.480 --> 02:28:45.480
We got a phone call.

02:28:45.480 --> 02:28:46.480
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:28:46.480 --> 02:28:47.480
Who's this?

02:28:47.480 --> 02:28:49.760
Hey, it's Rama back from Otacon 2010.

02:28:49.760 --> 02:28:50.760
Hey, Rama.

02:28:50.760 --> 02:28:51.760
What's up?

02:28:51.760 --> 02:28:52.760
Sup.

02:28:52.760 --> 02:28:53.760
How you doing?

02:28:53.760 --> 02:28:54.760
Hey.

02:28:54.760 --> 02:28:55.760
I'm doing good.

02:28:55.760 --> 02:28:58.960
I'm a little tired but, eh, it's a con.

02:28:58.960 --> 02:28:59.960
What do you expect?

02:28:59.960 --> 02:29:02.480
You didn't get confunk, did you?

02:29:02.480 --> 02:29:03.480
Cons are always exhausting.

02:29:03.480 --> 02:29:04.480
No, wait, wait.

02:29:04.480 --> 02:29:07.920
Just so you know, the term confunk is officially dead.

02:29:07.920 --> 02:29:10.520
It's been replaced with hobo.

02:29:10.520 --> 02:29:11.520
What?

02:29:11.520 --> 02:29:12.520
What?

02:29:12.520 --> 02:29:13.520
Okay.

02:29:13.520 --> 02:29:15.520
Haven't heard that before.

02:29:15.520 --> 02:29:16.520
Hobo.

02:29:16.520 --> 02:29:18.400
Horrific otaku body odor.

02:29:18.400 --> 02:29:19.400
Hobo.

02:29:19.400 --> 02:29:20.400
Oh, god.

02:29:20.400 --> 02:29:21.400
No, no, no, no, no, no.

02:29:21.400 --> 02:29:22.680
A similar thing happens at game conventions, too.

02:29:22.680 --> 02:29:23.680
No, no, no.

02:29:23.680 --> 02:29:28.280
Confunk, but keep in mind, confunk also, though, encompasses con disease.

02:29:28.280 --> 02:29:29.280
Ooh.

02:29:29.280 --> 02:29:30.280
Well, that's just...

02:29:30.280 --> 02:29:31.280
Well, that's...

02:29:31.280 --> 02:29:32.280
Which was coined here in California...

02:29:32.280 --> 02:29:33.280
Well, that's just...

02:29:33.280 --> 02:29:34.280
Which was coined here in California...

02:29:34.280 --> 02:29:35.280
...to replace the con in your pocket.

02:29:35.280 --> 02:29:38.400
...to replace the con in California as the Dorbola.

02:29:38.400 --> 02:29:41.640
Because remember, we can track it back to Doreen.

02:29:41.640 --> 02:29:42.640
I remember that, yes.

02:29:42.640 --> 02:29:43.640
Anyway...

02:29:43.640 --> 02:29:44.640
We got married!

02:29:44.640 --> 02:29:45.640
I know, I know.

02:29:45.640 --> 02:29:46.640
She and Simon got married.

02:29:46.640 --> 02:29:48.720
How was the con, Rama?

02:29:48.720 --> 02:29:53.480
It was good, despite some of the couple of things that happened this weekend.

02:29:53.480 --> 02:29:58.480
I had fun, my staff had fun, and I saw an ITG3 machine there.

02:29:58.480 --> 02:29:59.480
What?

02:29:59.480 --> 02:30:00.480
Wait, wait, wait.

02:30:00.480 --> 02:30:01.880
They made an in-the-groove 3?

02:30:01.880 --> 02:30:02.880
What?

02:30:02.880 --> 02:30:04.100
There was an in-the-groove 3 machine there.

02:30:04.100 --> 02:30:07.920
It wasn't on, so I don't know what was on it.

02:30:07.920 --> 02:30:10.800
My game reporter, I'll have to ask her what was on the machine.

02:30:10.800 --> 02:30:13.760
Didn't they get, like, sued to all hell?

02:30:13.760 --> 02:30:15.840
And they can't make any more?

02:30:15.840 --> 02:30:18.720
Was there a third mix officially?

02:30:18.720 --> 02:30:19.840
I don't know.

02:30:19.840 --> 02:30:24.640
I think it was in process before it got shut down, so, you know, maybe someone snuck it

02:30:24.640 --> 02:30:26.360
out and threw it onto a machine or something.

02:30:26.360 --> 02:30:29.040
I do have a picture of the unit, though.

02:30:29.040 --> 02:30:30.840
A purposefully leaked prototype.

02:30:30.840 --> 02:30:31.840
You said unit.

02:30:31.840 --> 02:30:35.560
His son in chat says ITG3 is a mod of ITG2.

02:30:35.560 --> 02:30:37.280
That wouldn't surprise me either, actually.

02:30:37.280 --> 02:30:38.280
That makes sense.

02:30:38.280 --> 02:30:40.880
Yeah, and oddly enough, there was no DDR machines there.

02:30:40.880 --> 02:30:45.720
It was just that one ITG machine and two pump-it-up Pro2 machines.

02:30:45.720 --> 02:30:46.720
Interesting.

02:30:46.720 --> 02:30:48.720
Yeah, very.

02:30:48.720 --> 02:30:50.200
What else in the gaming world?

02:30:50.200 --> 02:30:55.280
Well, I didn't cover too much of the gaming because I was more covering it than I could

02:30:55.280 --> 02:30:57.820
tell you about gaming cosplays.

02:30:57.820 --> 02:30:59.440
I can tell you this much.

02:30:59.440 --> 02:31:05.280
Every year when a Final Fantasy game comes out, everybody and their mother does cosplays,

02:31:05.280 --> 02:31:09.880
and for the longest time, the big cosplay was always Final Fantasy VII.

02:31:09.880 --> 02:31:10.880
I can tell you this right now.

02:31:10.880 --> 02:31:18.520
There was about 12 to 13 Final Fantasy cosplayers, 6 to 7 of them were from XIII.

02:31:18.520 --> 02:31:19.520
Wow.

02:31:19.520 --> 02:31:23.220
Well, XIII's very cosplayable.

02:31:23.220 --> 02:31:24.220
You know what I mean?

02:31:24.220 --> 02:31:27.440
It is, but I don't think it really went over well with a lot of the fans, because from

02:31:27.440 --> 02:31:31.480
when I talk to a lot of people, at first they love XIII, they're like, what the shit is

02:31:31.480 --> 02:31:32.480
this?

02:31:32.480 --> 02:31:33.480
Eh.

02:31:33.480 --> 02:31:34.480
Hmm.

02:31:34.480 --> 02:31:35.480
Eh.

02:31:35.480 --> 02:31:40.120
I don't know, I still like XIII, I don't know what y'all's problem is, but whatever.

02:31:40.120 --> 02:31:43.160
I enjoy XIII too, you know.

02:31:43.160 --> 02:31:45.600
The battle system just kinda threw me.

02:31:45.600 --> 02:31:47.440
That's probably what it is.

02:31:47.440 --> 02:31:48.440
Gotcha.

02:31:48.440 --> 02:31:50.960
Someone was supposed to lend me their copy.

02:31:50.960 --> 02:31:53.360
I keep forgetting, I'm sorry.

02:31:53.360 --> 02:31:57.600
You have to text me right before a show one night when I'm not in the bay.

02:31:57.600 --> 02:32:01.120
Let's see, what else do I want to ask you about the con?

02:32:01.120 --> 02:32:05.640
Well quickly, any really cool events, even anime style or whatever, what were some memorable

02:32:05.640 --> 02:32:07.360
moments of the con?

02:32:07.360 --> 02:32:14.640
Okay, my best memorable moment was the concert I went to this afternoon.

02:32:14.640 --> 02:32:19.020
It was a Japanese hip-hop group called Homemade Kazoku.

02:32:19.020 --> 02:32:24.600
The best way I could describe them is, if you remember hip-hop rap music from the 80s

02:32:24.600 --> 02:32:29.880
when it was good, that'd take it to the next level.

02:32:29.880 --> 02:32:30.880
I see.

02:32:30.880 --> 02:32:31.880
Okay.

02:32:31.880 --> 02:32:33.960
Are they as good as Dragon Ash?

02:32:33.960 --> 02:32:36.960
Honestly, I think they're better than Dragon Ash.

02:32:36.960 --> 02:32:37.960
Really?

02:32:37.960 --> 02:32:38.960
Oh, snap.

02:32:38.960 --> 02:32:42.440
And generally when a lot of Japanese artists come over, you know, they always have a little

02:32:42.440 --> 02:32:50.840
bit of trouble speaking English to the fans, they were speaking in pure, 100% English.

02:32:50.840 --> 02:32:55.720
No stuttering, no rough edges, it was just straight, clearly right across the board.

02:32:55.720 --> 02:33:02.640
I've been to a lot of J-Rock, J-Pop concerts at Otakano, the conventions.

02:33:02.640 --> 02:33:06.200
At this concert, everybody was on their feet going nuts.

02:33:06.200 --> 02:33:10.120
I've never seen a crowd this wild.

02:33:10.120 --> 02:33:11.120
Awesome.

02:33:11.120 --> 02:33:14.200
Well, Rama, we got to wrap up so we can get more calls.

02:33:14.200 --> 02:33:16.720
Do you have anything else you want to say about the con?

02:33:16.720 --> 02:33:19.560
There was a fire at the convention center.

02:33:19.560 --> 02:33:20.560
What?

02:33:20.560 --> 02:33:21.560
Yes.

02:33:21.560 --> 02:33:23.560
Did somebody say fire?

02:33:23.560 --> 02:33:25.560
Oh, no.

02:33:25.560 --> 02:33:44.240
So what'd you set on fire, Rama?

02:33:44.240 --> 02:33:45.240
Rob?

02:33:45.240 --> 02:33:46.240
What?

02:33:46.240 --> 02:33:47.240
You're a dick.

02:33:47.240 --> 02:33:48.240
You know what?

02:33:48.240 --> 02:33:49.240
I know.

02:33:49.240 --> 02:33:58.000
Okay, like, not everybody gets that joke, Rama.

02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:00.840
All right, well, tell us about the fire real quick.

02:34:00.840 --> 02:34:06.160
I was over in the Hilton doing a press conference with H&E Hotel, a Japanese fashion designer.

02:34:06.160 --> 02:34:11.380
I found out from my staffers that a grease fire broke out in the concession stand, which

02:34:11.380 --> 02:34:16.720
is downstairs, where the dealer's room is, they had to evacuate the entire convention

02:34:16.720 --> 02:34:17.720
center.

02:34:17.720 --> 02:34:18.720
What a con-runner.

02:34:18.720 --> 02:34:23.200
At least it wasn't snowing outside.

02:34:23.200 --> 02:34:27.520
And talking to some people, I kind of figured out who started the grease fire, and I think

02:34:27.520 --> 02:34:32.920
only me and Jamie will catch this joke as I post a link to the complex in the chat room.

02:34:32.920 --> 02:34:33.920
I did.

02:34:33.920 --> 02:34:34.920
I did.

02:34:34.920 --> 02:34:35.920
I did.

02:34:35.920 --> 02:34:36.920
I like what Amaze Satsuma says in our chat room.

02:34:36.920 --> 02:34:37.920
Con's on fire.

02:34:37.920 --> 02:34:38.920
Nice.

02:34:38.920 --> 02:34:39.920
I like that.

02:34:39.920 --> 02:34:44.120
I can be the theme song for when your con gets set on fire.

02:34:44.120 --> 02:34:45.480
All right.

02:34:45.480 --> 02:34:46.480
That's it.

02:34:46.480 --> 02:34:49.200
We're going to bring up on you now so we can take more calls, but have a good night.

02:34:49.200 --> 02:34:50.200
Good night.

02:34:50.200 --> 02:34:51.200
Bye.

02:34:51.200 --> 02:34:52.200
All right.

02:34:52.200 --> 02:34:53.200
Dude, fuck GameStop.

02:34:53.200 --> 02:34:56.520
We're going to take another call real quick, and then I want to know more about why you're

02:34:56.520 --> 02:34:57.520
angry.

02:34:57.520 --> 02:34:58.520
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:34:58.520 --> 02:34:59.520
Who's this?

02:34:59.520 --> 02:35:00.520
This is Kane IM.

02:35:00.520 --> 02:35:01.520
I'm sorry, what was that?

02:35:01.520 --> 02:35:02.520
It's Kane IM.

02:35:02.520 --> 02:35:03.520
This is Kane IM.

02:35:03.520 --> 02:35:04.520
Kane IM.

02:35:04.520 --> 02:35:05.520
You're a female.

02:35:05.520 --> 02:35:06.520
I got it.

02:35:06.520 --> 02:35:07.520
What's up, Kane IM?

02:35:07.520 --> 02:35:08.520
Not much.

02:35:08.520 --> 02:35:18.600
Actually, I did find a way to run the live show off my phone, so I do appreciate your

02:35:18.600 --> 02:35:19.600
guys' help.

02:35:19.600 --> 02:35:22.120
Oh, he's the same guy who emailed in about getting the...

02:35:22.120 --> 02:35:23.120
Yeah.

02:35:23.120 --> 02:35:24.120
Okay.

02:35:24.120 --> 02:35:25.120
What did you end up using?

02:35:25.120 --> 02:35:28.520
It was a shoutcast program.

02:35:28.520 --> 02:35:33.720
I did a little bit of searching online.

02:35:33.720 --> 02:35:34.720
I'm glad you were able to find something.

02:35:34.720 --> 02:35:42.440
I wanted to know if you guys had any suggestions on how to get an IRC program for my phone.

02:35:42.440 --> 02:35:44.560
An IRC program for your phone.

02:35:44.560 --> 02:35:48.000
So that I could join in on the chat.

02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:50.440
I know that there is one for iPhone.

02:35:50.440 --> 02:35:51.600
I don't know about the joint.

02:35:51.600 --> 02:35:55.860
I hate to say iPhone again, but again, that All Games app, whenever it comes back, because

02:35:55.860 --> 02:35:58.360
I imagine its disappearance is only temporary, you can get an IRC.

02:35:58.360 --> 02:35:59.680
The joint has a browser, right?

02:35:59.680 --> 02:36:00.680
Do you have a PSP?

02:36:00.680 --> 02:36:01.680
Yes.

02:36:01.680 --> 02:36:02.680
Okay.

02:36:02.680 --> 02:36:03.680
If you have a PSP...

02:36:03.680 --> 02:36:04.680
Yeah.

02:36:04.680 --> 02:36:09.400
If you have a PSP.com, then you can do the chat and the stream all from the PSP.

02:36:09.400 --> 02:36:10.400
Oh, no, wait.

02:36:10.400 --> 02:36:14.720
Unfortunately, I'm a truck driver, and Wi-Fi is kind of scarce.

02:36:14.720 --> 02:36:15.720
Oh, and you know what?

02:36:15.720 --> 02:36:18.840
I lied anyway, because the chat room on the PSP is totally separate.

02:36:18.840 --> 02:36:19.840
It's a junk.

02:36:19.840 --> 02:36:21.280
It's all filled with spammers, too.

02:36:21.280 --> 02:36:22.280
It's junk.

02:36:22.280 --> 02:36:24.280
It used to be awesome.

02:36:24.280 --> 02:36:25.280
Oh, hard.

02:36:25.280 --> 02:36:31.920
Gosh, I'm trying to think of IRC that you could do on a Black Bear, or no, you have

02:36:31.920 --> 02:36:32.920
an M-Droid, right?

02:36:32.920 --> 02:36:33.920
Yes.

02:36:33.920 --> 02:36:34.920
Yeah.

02:36:34.920 --> 02:36:38.080
I'm not sure.

02:36:38.080 --> 02:36:41.920
I'm opening up to our own chatters right now to see if they have any suggestions at

02:36:41.920 --> 02:36:44.560
chat.orangelandraday.com.

02:36:44.560 --> 02:36:50.920
I guess just try to search for something IRC, because with any IRC client, you should be

02:36:50.920 --> 02:36:55.900
able to connect to the Game Surge Network, which is the network we're on, and then it's

02:36:55.900 --> 02:36:58.520
just channel Orange Lounge.

02:36:58.520 --> 02:37:01.440
Any IRC client can get to our room.

02:37:01.440 --> 02:37:03.960
We use, here in studio, we use M-I-R-C.

02:37:03.960 --> 02:37:08.040
So yeah, and this toy guy in our chat says, IRC is IRC is IRC, right?

02:37:08.040 --> 02:37:09.040
And yes, that's correct.

02:37:09.040 --> 02:37:10.040
Yeah.

02:37:10.040 --> 02:37:14.880
So unfortunately, I don't know what IRC clients exist on that platform, but you have to run

02:37:14.880 --> 02:37:17.640
a search and maybe Google can tell you.

02:37:17.640 --> 02:37:19.120
All right, thanks.

02:37:19.120 --> 02:37:23.480
All right, well, good luck to you, and well, hey, any games that you've been playing while

02:37:23.480 --> 02:37:26.480
you've been out on the road?

02:37:26.480 --> 02:37:32.120
I just got Naughty Bear, and my one sinful pleasure is Harvest Moon.

02:37:32.120 --> 02:37:33.120
How do you like Naughty Bear?

02:37:33.120 --> 02:37:34.680
Because I really want to play it.

02:37:34.680 --> 02:37:38.280
I would picture manhunt with teddy bears.

02:37:38.280 --> 02:37:40.220
That's about all it is.

02:37:40.220 --> 02:37:41.220
Now see, it's-

02:37:41.220 --> 02:37:42.220
It's good for a giggle.

02:37:42.220 --> 02:37:43.220
Here's the thing, though.

02:37:43.220 --> 02:37:46.600
It sounds awesome, and I remember when we were looking at the previews here in studio,

02:37:46.600 --> 02:37:51.400
we were so excited and everything else, but I've heard the game is real shit.

02:37:51.400 --> 02:37:56.180
Like it's getting terrible reviews, so I'm kind of, you know, not the reviewers necessarily

02:37:56.180 --> 02:37:59.440
know everything, but it did kind of give me pause.

02:37:59.440 --> 02:38:03.760
I was like, wow, this game is doing really bad in the reviews.

02:38:03.760 --> 02:38:04.760
Can you see that?

02:38:04.760 --> 02:38:05.760
Why that's happening?

02:38:05.760 --> 02:38:07.160
Or do you think it's totally unfounded?

02:38:07.160 --> 02:38:14.400
The controls are a bit clunky, the camera doesn't seem to want to want to cooperate

02:38:14.400 --> 02:38:15.400
with you.

02:38:15.400 --> 02:38:22.360
I mean, I would wait if you really want to play it until either someone else plays it,

02:38:22.360 --> 02:38:25.120
or we play it bargain based.

02:38:25.120 --> 02:38:27.720
I can, maybe I'll do that bargain basement then.

02:38:27.720 --> 02:38:30.680
All right, it's too bad they can't get some of those basic things right.

02:38:30.680 --> 02:38:32.360
It's like they don't even play the game or something.

02:38:32.360 --> 02:38:33.360
I don't know.

02:38:33.360 --> 02:38:36.000
Well then, in about, you know, a couple of months I might just pick it up.

02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:38.840
Oh yeah, I thought you were an Xbox owner.

02:38:38.840 --> 02:38:40.000
It's only on 3-

02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:43.720
That doesn't mean I can't go over to somebody's house and play.

02:38:43.720 --> 02:38:45.520
That's usually where I get all my gaming experiences.

02:38:45.520 --> 02:38:49.960
I usually have some- I know a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy who owns a 360.

02:38:49.960 --> 02:38:50.960
There you go.

02:38:50.960 --> 02:38:51.960
There you go.

02:38:51.960 --> 02:38:55.520
All right, well K9M, we're going to let you get back to your thing, but thanks so much

02:38:55.520 --> 02:38:56.520
for the call.

02:38:56.520 --> 02:38:58.040
And good luck with the mobile phone quest.

02:38:58.040 --> 02:38:59.040
We appreciate you trying so hard.

02:38:59.040 --> 02:39:00.040
All right, no problem.

02:39:00.040 --> 02:39:04.240
You guys try and keep, you know, doing what you're doing and take it easy.

02:39:04.240 --> 02:39:05.320
Well thank you very much.

02:39:05.320 --> 02:39:06.320
Keep on trucking.

02:39:06.320 --> 02:39:07.320
All right.

02:39:07.320 --> 02:39:08.320
Bye.

02:39:08.320 --> 02:39:09.800
I've always wanted to say that to a truck driver.

02:39:09.800 --> 02:39:10.800
All right.

02:39:10.800 --> 02:39:16.180
All right, anyhow, let's see, I'm looking at chat and some folks clarifying some things

02:39:16.180 --> 02:39:21.800
about the OLR PSP and Hitstun is saying, OLR PSP's chat is a shout box, not an IRC chat.

02:39:21.800 --> 02:39:22.800
And that is correct.

02:39:22.800 --> 02:39:25.920
There is no IRC clients that work on PSP right now.

02:39:25.920 --> 02:39:30.020
Loki tried to get that to happen and he couldn't, because you're absolutely right.

02:39:30.020 --> 02:39:31.560
There's nothing that works right now.

02:39:31.560 --> 02:39:32.560
So there it is.

02:39:32.560 --> 02:39:34.240
Oh, we can do at least one more call.

02:39:34.240 --> 02:39:35.240
Hi, you're on Orange Orange Radio.

02:39:35.240 --> 02:39:36.240
Who's this?

02:39:36.240 --> 02:39:37.240
Yeah, hello there.

02:39:37.240 --> 02:39:38.240
Yo, hello.

02:39:38.240 --> 02:39:39.240
Hello.

02:39:39.240 --> 02:39:40.240
How are you doing?

02:39:40.240 --> 02:39:41.240
Who's this?

02:39:41.240 --> 02:39:43.800
This is that one, Aki Ripper from Sweden.

02:39:43.800 --> 02:39:44.800
Aki Ripper.

02:39:44.800 --> 02:39:46.080
From PlayStarts F2.

02:39:46.080 --> 02:39:47.080
From Sweden.

02:39:47.080 --> 02:39:48.080
It's the other Swede.

02:39:48.080 --> 02:39:49.560
It's another Battle of the Swedes night.

02:39:49.560 --> 02:39:50.560
I love it.

02:39:50.560 --> 02:39:51.560
We had our emailer.

02:39:51.560 --> 02:39:52.560
Aki Ripper.

02:39:52.560 --> 02:39:55.960
No, there's always room for at least two Swedish people.

02:39:55.960 --> 02:39:56.960
You know what?

02:39:56.960 --> 02:40:00.040
If a third Swedish person wanted to listen, I would welcome them too.

02:40:00.040 --> 02:40:01.040
What is on your mind?

02:40:01.040 --> 02:40:02.040
Well, I will...

02:40:02.040 --> 02:40:04.360
And if there were four, we could make our own version of Abba.

02:40:04.360 --> 02:40:06.600
All right, Aki Ripper, what's on your mind?

02:40:06.600 --> 02:40:07.600
Yo.

02:40:07.600 --> 02:40:09.600
What the funk.

02:40:09.600 --> 02:40:10.800
Damn it.

02:40:10.800 --> 02:40:11.800
What's on your mind?

02:40:11.800 --> 02:40:12.800
Hello?

02:40:12.800 --> 02:40:13.800
Yeah.

02:40:13.800 --> 02:40:14.800
Hello?

02:40:14.800 --> 02:40:15.800
What's on your mind?

02:40:15.800 --> 02:40:24.240
Well, I ramble on the network one time and, well, Star Wars 2 could be wonderful if I could

02:40:24.240 --> 02:40:25.240
play it.

02:40:25.240 --> 02:40:26.240
Oh, no.

02:40:26.240 --> 02:40:27.240
What's going on?

02:40:27.240 --> 02:40:28.240
Did they lock Sweden out?

02:40:28.240 --> 02:40:29.240
No, no.

02:40:29.240 --> 02:40:36.560
The thing is that I can't play it due to the thing that Battle of the Swedes refused to

02:40:36.560 --> 02:40:42.360
accept that I have tapped in my key in Battle of the Swedes and said it's listed.

02:40:42.360 --> 02:40:48.200
But when I launch a game and say like, no, you do not have a stock FT associated with

02:40:48.200 --> 02:40:50.600
your Battle of the account.

02:40:50.600 --> 02:40:58.200
Like it's all listed there, but the game refuses to say no, yes, or something.

02:40:58.200 --> 02:41:00.520
We have an angry, angry Swede on the show tonight.

02:41:00.520 --> 02:41:02.600
You hear that anger in his voice.

02:41:02.600 --> 02:41:03.600
I don't...

02:41:03.600 --> 02:41:12.160
I'm quite pissed in that regard since, well, I, well, around, well, 900 Swedish crowns

02:41:12.160 --> 02:41:18.280
and that, which is like, I'm going to be a rough, how much, by the way, is the collector's

02:41:18.280 --> 02:41:21.440
edition in, anyway, it's the collector's edition.

02:41:21.440 --> 02:41:22.440
$99.

02:41:22.440 --> 02:41:28.680
How much, how much you pay it, pay it in, and they can do it out, but it's somewhere

02:41:28.680 --> 02:41:36.840
around, well, somewhere around 90 bucks or even less.

02:41:36.840 --> 02:41:37.840
Wow.

02:41:37.840 --> 02:41:41.800
Well, here's, here's a suggestion, I don't even know if this works, you probably already

02:41:41.800 --> 02:41:42.800
done this.

02:41:42.800 --> 02:41:46.760
Have you logged onto the web portal, going onto battle.net on the web and making sure

02:41:46.760 --> 02:41:48.760
that the game is associated there?

02:41:48.760 --> 02:41:52.920
Yeah, well there, it's listed there.

02:41:52.920 --> 02:42:01.760
And well, the thing is that, well, I've, and here's the other thing though, the, the work

02:42:01.760 --> 02:42:05.040
around that I'm trying to do is, well, change password.

02:42:05.040 --> 02:42:12.600
If it weren't for the following fact that I had forgotten my like hidden question, hidden,

02:42:12.600 --> 02:42:15.120
that's my, that's my problem, that's my problem.

02:42:15.120 --> 02:42:24.520
So and I've, and well, I've tried for, tried to, for, tried calling the, calling Blizzard

02:42:24.520 --> 02:42:28.880
about it, but here's the other thing though, trying to call the Blizzard line around these

02:42:28.880 --> 02:42:31.180
parts, around these seems quite hard.

02:42:31.180 --> 02:42:37.600
And the irony is that I've managed to, managed to call the US one when I had problems with

02:42:37.600 --> 02:42:43.680
the, you know, when I had problems with my, at the time when I was playing World of Warcraft

02:42:43.680 --> 02:42:47.760
on US, on US servers, then I got straight along.

02:42:47.760 --> 02:42:52.280
And now it's like, yeah, you're out of luck or something.

02:42:52.280 --> 02:42:53.400
Oh, well anyway.

02:42:53.400 --> 02:42:56.740
Has your WoW account been inactive for some time?

02:42:56.740 --> 02:43:05.040
My WoW account, my, both of my WoW accounts have been inactive for like a one of a year.

02:43:05.040 --> 02:43:07.360
Did you have an authenticator on that account?

02:43:07.360 --> 02:43:15.240
No, I did not because I, because the authenticator, when I played the, the authenticator wasn't

02:43:15.240 --> 02:43:16.240
released yet.

02:43:16.240 --> 02:43:21.460
It is possible, and I don't know, but it's possible that your account got hacked because

02:43:21.460 --> 02:43:25.800
I have heard of people that even though they had inactive Warcraft accounts, that some

02:43:25.800 --> 02:43:30.400
people would go in there and like reactivate them to get access to the characters.

02:43:30.400 --> 02:43:32.720
It's crazy, crazy stuff.

02:43:32.720 --> 02:43:36.080
Just hypothesizing that that could be what's screwing with you over there.

02:43:36.080 --> 02:43:42.480
So definitely, uh, you're going to have to keep on Blizzard and, and I guess, well, I

02:43:42.480 --> 02:43:49.680
will have to call them or, or in something because, well, uh, but, but, but my, one of

02:43:49.680 --> 02:43:55.960
the problems that I have also is that, well, if I remember right, to be able to identify,

02:43:55.960 --> 02:44:02.880
well, I'm have to go find, the problem is also is that I need to find like a scanner

02:44:02.880 --> 02:44:13.720
or a scanner because I need to scan in my passport or something, uh, to send a, well,

02:44:13.720 --> 02:44:20.800
to a basic way, like maybe in a file and send it to them and say that, yes, this is me of

02:44:20.800 --> 02:44:21.800
sorts.

02:44:21.800 --> 02:44:22.800
What a pain.

02:44:22.800 --> 02:44:24.880
Or are you just going to have to give them the angry Swede?

02:44:24.880 --> 02:44:27.640
Sounds like this angry Swede is quite justified in his anger.

02:44:27.640 --> 02:44:28.640
Yes.

02:44:28.640 --> 02:44:29.640
I, I, I wish you the best.

02:44:29.640 --> 02:44:31.360
I wish there was a magic wand.

02:44:31.360 --> 02:44:39.440
In that regard, I am quite pissed and also because, well, and also because, well, uh,

02:44:39.440 --> 02:44:44.240
Starcraft 2, and here's the other thing though, in a kind of way, I already know what happens

02:44:44.240 --> 02:44:50.400
in, because also the thing is, so, uh, playing Starcraft, I wasn't that hyped for Starcraft

02:44:50.400 --> 02:44:56.640
2 in a kind of way anyway, since, uh, the thing that I did is that since I got the collector's

02:44:56.640 --> 02:45:02.540
edition, you have this like special DVD of sorts when you get all the, uh, the, uh, video

02:45:02.540 --> 02:45:06.240
frequencies from the game and I'm like, yeah, let's watch this.

02:45:06.240 --> 02:45:09.880
So yeah, you just got spoiled the whole game.

02:45:09.880 --> 02:45:19.120
Well, here's the other thing though, uh, and even more fun is that, well, if I, and especially

02:45:19.120 --> 02:45:22.560
actually in a kind of way, since I'm like one of those players that played through the

02:45:22.560 --> 02:45:31.720
first Starcraft game, we're playing like code power overwhelming, yes, please.

02:45:31.720 --> 02:45:34.080
Which was that, well, god mode activated.

02:45:34.080 --> 02:45:35.280
Oh well.

02:45:35.280 --> 02:45:36.280
Okay.

02:45:36.280 --> 02:45:37.280
Ripper.

02:45:37.280 --> 02:45:39.720
I wish I could fix it for you, but it sounds like you're just going to have to keep on

02:45:39.720 --> 02:45:42.120
Blizzard customer support, but do let us know what happens.

02:45:42.120 --> 02:45:43.120
Okay, buddy.

02:45:43.120 --> 02:45:45.120
Yeah, well, I'll keep you updated.

02:45:45.120 --> 02:45:46.120
All right.

02:45:46.120 --> 02:45:47.120
I hope he can get to the zerging soon.

02:45:47.120 --> 02:45:48.120
All right.

02:45:48.120 --> 02:45:49.120
Hang in there.

02:45:49.120 --> 02:45:50.120
Take care, buddy.

02:45:50.120 --> 02:45:51.120
Bye.

02:45:51.120 --> 02:45:52.120
All right.

02:45:52.120 --> 02:45:53.120
Poor guy.

02:45:53.120 --> 02:45:56.040
But Hey, tough lesson for everybody learned.

02:45:56.040 --> 02:45:57.040
Learn it.

02:45:57.040 --> 02:45:58.040
Okay.

02:45:58.040 --> 02:45:59.040
Ripper's expense.

02:45:59.040 --> 02:46:00.600
Learn at the expense of the Swedes.

02:46:00.600 --> 02:46:04.800
Don't forget your security question because that sucks when that happens.

02:46:04.800 --> 02:46:09.280
You got to be very careful with that stuff, so make sure you will be able to remember

02:46:09.280 --> 02:46:13.320
it later on or else you're going to have all those problems that Aki Ripper was talking

02:46:13.320 --> 02:46:14.320
about there.

02:46:14.320 --> 02:46:15.320
All right.

02:46:15.320 --> 02:46:17.840
Well, that is going to do it for Orange Laundria's phone calls tonight.

02:46:17.840 --> 02:46:19.400
We're going to close up the Skypline.

02:46:19.400 --> 02:46:20.400
I don't know.

02:46:20.400 --> 02:46:22.600
Usually Loki is the collector of last minute stories.

02:46:22.600 --> 02:46:24.760
I don't know if Dark Sakura pulled anything.

02:46:24.760 --> 02:46:25.760
I did.

02:46:25.760 --> 02:46:26.760
You did?

02:46:26.760 --> 02:46:28.600
Well, Dark Sakura, what do you have for last minute stories tonight?

02:46:28.600 --> 02:46:34.960
The Canadians are luring game developers out of Alabama.

02:46:34.960 --> 02:46:39.360
I didn't realize there was like this whole avalanche of game developers in Alabama in

02:46:39.360 --> 02:46:40.360
the first place.

02:46:40.360 --> 02:46:48.040
Well, the province of Newfoundland and Labrador paid $300,000 to a Huntsville, Alabama video

02:46:48.040 --> 02:46:52.600
game development company so it could set up a studio in Canada.

02:46:52.600 --> 02:47:00.480
It's Bit Trap Studios Canada is doing a multiplayer online games and wants some help.

02:47:00.480 --> 02:47:01.480
I see.

02:47:01.480 --> 02:47:05.920
They're hoping that it will infuse $1.6 million into the local economy.

02:47:05.920 --> 02:47:06.920
I see.

02:47:06.920 --> 02:47:09.520
I knew those Canadians were up to no good.

02:47:09.520 --> 02:47:11.920
It's an economic war that they're declaring.

02:47:11.920 --> 02:47:12.920
I see.

02:47:12.920 --> 02:47:18.280
But that was like jazz.

02:47:18.280 --> 02:47:21.240
Time to start pouring your maple syrup down the sewers.

02:47:21.240 --> 02:47:24.720
Like, dude, I'm from Alabama, so it was cool.

02:47:24.720 --> 02:47:27.800
I'm just, obviously I'm teasing, come on.

02:47:27.800 --> 02:47:29.760
We like our neighbors to the north really.

02:47:29.760 --> 02:47:30.760
Usually.

02:47:30.760 --> 02:47:31.760
Usually.

02:47:31.760 --> 02:47:32.760
Most days.

02:47:32.760 --> 02:47:33.760
Most days.

02:47:33.760 --> 02:47:34.760
All right.

02:47:34.760 --> 02:47:35.760
Anything else?

02:47:35.760 --> 02:47:36.760
Was that it?

02:47:36.760 --> 02:47:37.760
Nope.

02:47:37.760 --> 02:47:38.760
All right.

02:47:38.760 --> 02:47:39.760
No, that was not it or no, there's nothing else?

02:47:39.760 --> 02:47:40.760
No, there's nothing else.

02:47:40.760 --> 02:47:41.760
All right.

02:47:41.760 --> 02:47:42.760
I'm being a jerk.

02:47:42.760 --> 02:47:43.760
All right.

02:47:43.760 --> 02:47:44.760
That's going to do it for Orange Laundry tonight.

02:47:44.760 --> 02:47:48.640
It's about time for us to go around and wrap everything up and put the nail in the coffin

02:47:48.640 --> 02:47:49.640
of the show.

02:47:49.640 --> 02:47:52.560
We're going to go around and get everybody's final thought, but first I have to thank our

02:47:52.560 --> 02:47:55.320
guests for being here tonight because they did great work.

02:47:55.320 --> 02:47:56.960
Really did good work tonight.

02:47:56.960 --> 02:47:57.960
Really appreciate it.

02:47:57.960 --> 02:47:59.200
So, Gary, thank you so much for being here tonight.

02:47:59.200 --> 02:48:00.200
You're welcome.

02:48:00.200 --> 02:48:01.200
It was a pleasure.

02:48:01.200 --> 02:48:02.200
Glad to be here.

02:48:02.200 --> 02:48:04.560
I hope the show has inspired you to get up in console and PC gaming.

02:48:04.560 --> 02:48:06.360
I saw you were doing the Dungeons and Dragons download.

02:48:06.360 --> 02:48:09.720
Yeah, but I'm also thinking about what console I should buy, so.

02:48:09.720 --> 02:48:10.720
Oh, tough decision.

02:48:10.720 --> 02:48:11.720
Tough decision.

02:48:11.720 --> 02:48:12.720
Yes, it is.

02:48:12.720 --> 02:48:13.720
Let me help you after the show.

02:48:13.720 --> 02:48:14.720
All right.

02:48:14.720 --> 02:48:20.080
So, do come back and let us know what you end up getting and what PC games you do end

02:48:20.080 --> 02:48:21.080
up getting into.

02:48:21.080 --> 02:48:22.080
Oh, I'd love to come back.

02:48:22.080 --> 02:48:23.080
All right.

02:48:23.080 --> 02:48:24.080
Please do.

02:48:24.080 --> 02:48:26.080
Also, Myla, thank you so much for being on the show tonight.

02:48:26.080 --> 02:48:27.080
No problem.

02:48:27.080 --> 02:48:28.080
Appreciate it.

02:48:28.080 --> 02:48:32.080
And a shout out to my lovelies in the chat rooms who actually know who I am.

02:48:32.080 --> 02:48:33.080
We love the chatters.

02:48:33.080 --> 02:48:34.080
Appreciate them.

02:48:34.080 --> 02:48:35.080
So, yeah.

02:48:35.080 --> 02:48:36.080
Go RuneScape.

02:48:36.080 --> 02:48:37.080
Okay.

02:48:37.080 --> 02:48:38.080
I'm done.

02:48:38.080 --> 02:48:39.880
And Myla, keep enjoying your 12-year-old game.

02:48:39.880 --> 02:48:40.880
I know.

02:48:40.880 --> 02:48:41.880
It's great.

02:48:41.880 --> 02:48:42.880
I know.

02:48:42.880 --> 02:48:43.880
No, no.

02:48:43.880 --> 02:48:44.880
No gaming reports.

02:48:44.880 --> 02:48:46.880
So, between you and Drunami, I think we'll be pretty covered.

02:48:46.880 --> 02:48:47.880
So, come on back sometime.

02:48:47.880 --> 02:48:48.880
Yup.

02:48:48.880 --> 02:48:49.880
Yup.

02:48:49.880 --> 02:48:50.880
Yup.

02:48:50.880 --> 02:48:51.880
With this economy, you need it.

02:48:51.880 --> 02:48:54.680
DarkSakura, I'm going to ask for your final thought tonight.

02:48:54.680 --> 02:48:56.680
What is your final thought?

02:48:56.680 --> 02:48:57.680
Ow.

02:48:57.680 --> 02:48:59.360
Poor thing.

02:48:59.360 --> 02:49:01.200
DarkSakura deserves our full sympathy.

02:49:01.200 --> 02:49:02.200
It's been a rough week.

02:49:02.200 --> 02:49:03.200
Sympathy.

02:49:03.200 --> 02:49:04.200
I want a cookie.

02:49:04.200 --> 02:49:05.200
You need a hug.

02:49:05.200 --> 02:49:06.200
And a cookie.

02:49:06.200 --> 02:49:07.200
And a cookie.

02:49:07.200 --> 02:49:08.200
And a pony.

02:49:08.200 --> 02:49:09.200
And a dinner.

02:49:09.200 --> 02:49:10.200
I need to give our guests their final thought, too.

02:49:10.200 --> 02:49:12.200
Gary, do you have a final thought tonight?

02:49:12.200 --> 02:49:18.600
Um, it's been too long since I've done any console game or any computer game and I need

02:49:18.600 --> 02:49:19.600
back into it.

02:49:19.600 --> 02:49:24.040
It looks like things have taken quantum leaps from the last time I did this seriously.

02:49:24.040 --> 02:49:27.840
I saw the screenshots of Arkham Asylum and was blown away, so.

02:49:27.840 --> 02:49:29.400
I'm glad we could inspire you.

02:49:29.400 --> 02:49:30.400
Yup.

02:49:30.400 --> 02:49:32.120
Uh, Myla, do you have a final thought tonight?

02:49:32.120 --> 02:49:33.120
DC Online.

02:49:33.120 --> 02:49:34.120
Wow.

02:49:34.120 --> 02:49:35.120
Oh yeah.

02:49:35.120 --> 02:49:36.880
You're totally going to be there, too.

02:49:36.880 --> 02:49:37.880
Can't wait.

02:49:37.880 --> 02:49:42.320
Uh, and my final thought is, I think Pinkberry would make it all better.

02:49:42.320 --> 02:49:43.320
Yeah.

02:49:43.320 --> 02:49:44.320
I've never been there.

02:49:44.320 --> 02:49:45.320
It's really good.

02:49:45.320 --> 02:49:47.200
But sadly, it's Sunday and they're not going to be open.

02:49:47.200 --> 02:49:48.200
But anyway, tomorrow.

02:49:48.200 --> 02:49:49.200
Aw.

02:49:49.200 --> 02:49:50.200
Alright, that's it, guys.

02:49:50.200 --> 02:49:51.200
Have a wonderful week.

02:49:51.200 --> 02:49:53.040
We will be back here next week to do it all over again.

02:49:53.040 --> 02:49:55.320
Unfortunately, Loki's going to be out for a little while longer.

02:49:55.320 --> 02:49:59.560
But hey, DarkSakura and I are perfectly capable of holding down the fort, so tune in next

02:49:59.560 --> 02:50:02.520
week to see what the antics bring and- I got duct tape.

02:50:02.520 --> 02:50:07.400
We're going to have a co-host next week to fill in for Loki, so more on that next week.

02:50:07.400 --> 02:50:09.640
We'll see you next week here at Orange Lounge Radio.

02:50:09.640 --> 02:50:11.680
Oh, I almost forgot.

02:50:11.680 --> 02:50:14.680
If you did enjoy our show, please tell two people about the show.

02:50:14.680 --> 02:50:18.040
Help us spread the word because we're not a multi-million dollar organization.

02:50:18.040 --> 02:50:22.000
You know, we're excited when we have $10 in the budget to spend on a Facebook ad.

02:50:22.000 --> 02:50:25.160
So we really, really can use your guys' help in helping us spread the word of Orange Lounge

02:50:25.160 --> 02:50:26.160
Radio.

02:50:26.160 --> 02:50:27.160
That's all we ask.

02:50:27.160 --> 02:50:28.160
Alright?

02:50:28.160 --> 02:50:29.160
So we'll see you next week.

02:50:29.160 --> 02:50:30.160
Have a great night.

02:50:30.160 --> 02:50:31.160
