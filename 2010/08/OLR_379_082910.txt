Tonight, August 29th, 2010, could Sony soon adopt the controversial online pass?
Two retail chains jump in the used video game market, and an upcoming MMO plans to penalize players that play too much.
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio, the video game show where every gamer has a voice.
We do tape live every Sunday night at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be joining over the next few hours with my awesome co-host, always here every week, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
I hope I'm always here, it's my house.
Well, there have been times where you haven't been here and those are the awkward shows.
The awkward shows where Dan's like, are they going to run off with the vault?
There's also been about six different studios in OLR's history.
We tend to bounce around like a homeless college kid.
This one's my favorite.
Yeah, because you just have to roll out of bed and into the studio.
This is my least favorite because I have to drive out here.
At least I like you.
I like your garage too.
It was nice.
Except it was hot.
Yep, so... You seem to be doing okay, though.
You seem to be awake enough, but if you not... Well, I can thank, you know, playing Final Fantasy XI for early hours in the morning, you know, to thank for that, since, you know, that kind of got me accustomed to, you know, being able to operate without that much sleep.
Well, if you nod off during the show, we'll know what's going on, right?
DarkSakura
Um, it was fairly old school.
I don't know if the pile of Master System games is still out in the front room, because I've gotten used to it out there, but Dan was playing some Alex Kidd and Shinobi World, and Zillion, a lot of Zillion, and we played a couple things together.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
That only came out in Brazil.
And that was also after the Genesis version was out.
Because, you know, remember, Blast Processing was the secret to Sonic.
Remember that?
So there wasn't... Yeah, I mean, yeah, there was a Sonic on the Master System, but it was a little bit, you know, not... It was way after the fact.
So I sort of saw, back in the day, Alex Kidd as the Mario on Sega's system.
I mean, I don't know.
In my young mind, that's kind of what I saw.
Monopoly Monopoly
Oh, wow.
As in Monopoly, but they actually did M-O-N-O space capital P-O-L-Y.
Awesome.
So we have Monopoly.
Monopoly.
Nice.
But Dan didn't actually have the Master System.
He was using the Power Base Converter on the Genesis.
And then I played some Star Trek online today.
I made an Andorian chick just because.
And...
I was given a game on Steam and one of our listeners sent me something fantastic and I put it over here because I've been waiting for Dan to get off the old school kick so I could play Final Fantasy XIII.
Thank you.
Gave me Rival School's drama album.
Wait, from a listener?
Yeah.
Wow.
And it was addressed to Sakura Kasugano.
Do you know what listener sent that to you?
I'm trying to remember, I've got the box right here, but I didn't put the name on it, just his real name.
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Thank you, Fred.
Siv4 I got from X-Link and I got the same Steam game you did.
Oh, that was... Okay.
Because, yeah, I've been meaning to try it out.
I started school last week.
So, of course, there goes... I play Peggle at Fuddruckers.
When they ruin my order!
Let me go into our chatroom at chat.orangelandstreetie.com.
Dark Kiske is in chat trying to take responsibility for sending it to you, but said JK.
Let's see, Dark Tetsuya says, I don't know what my favorite Sega Master System game is.
Toss up between the Ghostbusters port and Astro Warrior.
Was the Ghostbusters port on Sega Master System the same one that was on Commodore 64 and the computers back in the early 80s?
Or is that a different Ghostbusters game?
Are you the gatekeeper?
So this is the last semester of school for you, right?
You graduate away this year?
Well, not forever the last semester.
You've been in school since the show started.
Well, you know why, and I've got to say this.
There's nothing wrong with always wanting to enrich the mind.
I spent way too much time doing what everyone else said that I should do instead of doing what I love, and now I just said, fuck it, I'm doing what I love.
And I'm going to graduate with my AA, and I'm going to do a year of the rest of my gen ed for...
I'm actually kind of thinking of not going to Sac State, maybe going to UC Davis.
It'll be a drive, but I might get a better education out of it.
So you'd say the life lesson you learned is that you should go to school to study what you love?
Yeah.
Can I major in pornography in college?
Rob.
What?
My point is that when you find something that you can make a living out of that you love, go for it.
I also love food, but I can't cook.
So I don't know what to do.
You could actually take journalism classes and be a food critic.
Now that's a good idea.
Aren't all food critics fat?
Don't take offense if you're a food critic.
I've never known any.
You could have high metabolism.
But they're all pompous asses.
At least that's what I've gathered from watching the Food Network.
Actually, on Iron Chef America, Julie Chan is a food critic and she's my hero.
We should do a one-off side podcast that's called Fat Butt.
And talk about all the food we love that makes our butts fat.
That's what Alan calls me, actually.
Really?
I could be the host, Fat Butt.
He shouldn't call you Fat Butt.
I'm making that up.
He should call you Plump Booty.
I'm not going to get into it.
Actually, my nickname is Fat Kitty.
I'm not going to get into that.
I'm gonna get a text message in 5, 4, 3, STOP TALKING!
Alright, anyhow, if that's it for DarkSakura's Gaming Week, Loki, how was your Gaming Week?
It was okay.
Didn't really play a lot except for on Friday where we did this kind of company sales team building thing where we went to Dave & Buster's and played some games.
The whole team building portion of that event was kind of dumb because they have this arcade full of wonderful games and they put you on all the old...
All the really crappy games.
Except for, say, Rallying Classic, which is better known as Daytona.
Sans License, you know.
And that was fun.
But the person that was kind of... They had us split up into groups of four, so we were all teams of four.
And the guy that was in charge of our three teams of four was an idiot.
And instead of putting three people up each round to have them go head-to-head against each team, they just had each team compete against themselves.
And because of that and his horrible scorekeeping, we ended up near last place because he was a complete idiot.
Not that it matters because it was just for fun, but whatever.
It's still a waste of time.
I did, though, play some arcade games.
I got to play the Rambo shooting game, which is kind of funny.
But, I mean, it's just kind of... They have that at Golf Land, too.
Did you play the Terminator one?
Because that one's actually really fun.
No, I did walk past it a bunch of times, and that looked really cool.
And it's hard.
But I just didn't get a chance to do that.
There are so many pretty games there.
But I actually played some DDR, played DDRX, and I...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
How that works is beyond me, but that's what happens.
So I played some doubles on that.
I don't really care for the new stage that they have.
It looks really cheap because it's all one single sheet of metal that they have in there instead of all the little panels, which are really cool looking.
But, yeah, whatever.
And the spacing's a little different.
But that's minor.
Um...
Let's see, what else?
I played a game called Tank, Tank, Tank, which is kind of fun.
Which mission did you do?
Did you do the giant monster mission?
Well, we just played Versus, so... Oh, no.
Next time you play that, you have to do co-op and play against the giant bees.
And the giant squid.
And then the building mecha.
Oh, you were telling me about this game.
This game is so much fun!
It's Tank versus Bees.
that's strange you can either choose versus or you know two tanks versus two other tanks or you can go against the evil robot hordes and so you get like these big missiles with grinny faces on them they're so fantastic I don't know bees are pretty fucking terrible I call them mecha bees but yeah tank tank tank was pretty fun and there was some other game that we played it was kind of like track mania the arcade game almost and that was alright what else did I play there
That was about it.
I just played a lot of DDR.
I'm not very in shape anymore.
It's been a while since I played DDR, but I actually did play A on doubles on, I guess it's called Expert now, which is like an 11-footer.
and I passed it but oh my god I felt like crap afterwards of course now that I think of it I don't think there's ever been a time they played a and doubles on heavy or whatever that actually didn't feel like crap afterwards so that's fine did you go right into playing a hard song
Well, no, that was my last song.
I actually played... Still, just in one game, you played, you know, wow.
You ever heard of a warm-up?
I did play warm-up stuff.
It was really tiring me out, though, because I'm not used to it anymore.
So I was playing, you know, some of the new songs that were in there were kind of dumb, so I didn't really care for the new DDRX songs, I guess.
I played a few actually a few times I played Hysteria because I liked one of the patterns for I guess it was the I don't even know what they call it now the second setting it would have been trick I don't remember they change them all just to change them it's just annoying whatever red difficulty right yes the medium difficulty I like the double pattern for that so that was fun and then I was trying to remember like I remember there was
you know 20 November I know if you play that on I think heavy and little that like makes no notes for like quite a while that would have been fun also there's another one that was like that
Anyway, so, played a few rounds of that, and that was fun, um, and then, of course, you know, Redemption stuff, played some Deal or No Deal, because, I mean, that game was super easy, um, but yeah, so now, it was funny, because I had a bunch of Dave and Buster power cards from, like,
Back when we went to our first E3, like when we went to Irvine, you know, and went to that Dave & Buster's, I had a card from that.
Wow, that was a long time ago.
I had one from when we went to Milpitas one time, and so I combined that together with one that they gave us to use during this competition.
Then I got another one from them later on, so I have like a bunch of credits at Dave & Buster's right now.
I just haven't gotten a chance to use them.
but it's not bad it's a small one compared to the other ones and they even said though like because the people are reps at Dave and Buster's they said it's one of the I think it's the smallest one that they have which is kind of lame but whatever it's nice to at least have one they should put another one in Folsom though I definitely agree that because there's nothing in Folsom and it's kind of weird that they put Dave and Buster's like right next to Golf Land and right down the street from you know John's Incredible Pizza you know all these different like fun land places it's weird they're right there
And then, of course, other than that, Grand Theft Auto Lost and Damned.
I've been playing a lot more of that.
And that's still fun.
I'm working on mod stuff.
It's kind of annoying, though, because I'm sure not a lot of people are familiar with the Grand Theft Auto console modding community.
But they're very, I don't know, very...
I don't know what the word would be for it.
They're dicks, I guess.
It's because they figure out something and they kind of hold it above everybody's head.
Well, I figured out something, so I posted about it because, you know, it's kind of cool.
I thought I'd share something.
And so now they're saying, oh, well, we did the same thing and we're not going to tell you guys how to do it until a while from now.
So I posted in that same thread how to do it.
And they went and deleted my post.
I'm like, you motherfuckers.
So I got to release something.
Wait, what is this?
It's modding the game.
I figured out how to change the maps, and actually I figured out how to change where different cars spawn and stuff like that.
Make your own website.
Well, I don't even give a crap.
Okay, all you do...
Post an Orange Lounge Radio story.
It's really easy.
I'll send you the PDF that Dekeman made.
You post a news story to OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
Title of story.
What's the name of this website?
Seven Sins.
Fuck Seven Sins.
And then post your hacks and all that stuff.
It's like high school drama.
It's so pathetic.
It is a bunch of high schoolers, I hate to break it to ya
No, I already have a YouTube video out there of it, and so I'm all set.
I've got my bases covered, but it's just that, you know, these guys... Dibs.
Loki has dibs.
It's just, like, they sent me a private message that says, don't worry, we'll give you, you know, we're crediting you for indirectly coming up with this idea.
I'm like, indirectly?
I directly came up with this fucking idea, stupid.
I don't mean to be rude but...
I just have problems people taking credit for something I came up with.
The whole point was I was just trying to give them an idea because all the stuff that they have out there right now, hacks, is just people editing the lines for the handling of the cars and stuff like that.
So, oh, look, this car's fast.
Oh, look, this car crashes through things.
Oh, this one flies.
Big fucking whoop.
Alright, I gotta take a sidetrack here to read some of the chat comments because they've been accumulating here.
SpazinatorPSN is talking about that Tank Tank Tank game.
It says, when you beat Tank Tank Tank and watch the credits, it says, tanks for playing!
Yep.
Get it?
Haha.
See, remember earlier I was talking about food and porn and all that and what we should major in in school?
SatelliteMinded in chat says, Rob should combine food and porn and make a living from that.
And Ranma follows that up with a website called www.foodporndaily.com, which I'd never heard of, but...
Yum, all you do is you click on pictures of food.
Like this one is mac and cheese with bacon and chicken.
Then I click it again.
Mmm, pork chops with parsley.
Yum.
And it's just food porn.
Mmm, salmon sliders.
What about this is why you're fat?
A lot of that stuff makes me ew, but this is like classy porn.
Yeah.
This is more like... It's the difference between an escort and a 20-buck prostitute.
This is like Cinemax.
Right here, the food porn daily is like Cinemax.
And this is why your fat.com is like Hustler.
That's basically the difference between the two.
There you go.
All right, anyhow.
Anything else for your gaming week, Loki?
Sorry.
No, that's really it.
I'm just glad, though, my dev kit's coming next week.
I'm excited to see how that kind of works out for you.
Curious how that plays or whatever.
We'll see.
All right.
Let's see my gaming week.
I've been playing... Oh, real quick.
Oh, fine.
Not my gaming week.
It's just a story, real quick.
This is funny.
Yes.
I experienced on my way over to the show today what I would consider white trash karaoke.
Thanks for watching!
Please tell me she's singing like, you know, Kesha or something.
Wake up in the morning feeling like we did it.
It's like some country western song or something, but it was awful.
I'm like, why would you blast that?
Seriously, I thought they were having like a party or something, but no, it's just this one chick apparently wanting to annoy the neighbors.
She wants to be famous.
Let's see.
Well, I actually will start off.
I have a completely, like, doesn't have anything to do with gaming story, but I had a very strange weekend, okay?
I was actually supposed to be going to LA this weekend, but I didn't end up going.
And part of the reason why I didn't end up going is that I was scheduled to take a flight on JetBlue from Sacramento to Long Beach.
Because that's, you know, probably one of the easiest ways to get to LA, and JetBlue is a fine airline.
You can watch TV in the back seats and everything.
So we get to the airport, we're sitting there waiting for our flight to go, and suddenly they come on the intercom and say, well, your plane had to evacuate, there was an emergency, the brakes caught fire, and sure enough, we're looking out the window and there's this plane sitting there on the runway and the slides are all inflated and all these people are standing out kind of looking.
and yeah if you heard about that because it was kind of a big deal it was on like CNN and stuff yeah I was supposed to be on that plane so I was sitting there in the terminal while that plane was landing waiting to board it so yeah that was kind of a day ruiner we tried to catch another flight that was seven hours later in Oakland but we were like okay well at least we'll still get to go to LA at some point
and then uh yeah that flight ended up getting delayed for about three and a half hours because the whole system was backed up and that's about the point where we said fuck it because a we could have just driven there faster b we were going to lose our rental car and all this other stuff and it was kind of annoying so uh kind of a bummer but yeah just a completely random story because you know it's it's not every day that you're sitting right in front of national news unfolding before your eyes
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
That's pretty cool.
How much did they pair?
$75.
She was thinking she probably could have got more, but at the same time, at a moment like that, you're not thinking, oh, I want to take a picture so I can sell it.
I think it was more of a novelty thing.
How many people can say they've sold a picture to the Associated Press?
That's not an everyday occurrence.
I think she did it more for the novelty of it than for the actual money, and I can't say I blame her.
I would have done the same thing.
I took pictures too on Twitter, it's just that iPhone pictures don't have nearly the detail that she actually took them on a real camera.
That's why they wanted her pictures, because not a lot of people had that.
So, yeah, kind of a weird weekend.
So, let's see.
Monty Boggs in our chatroom says, stuff like that happens in airlines, bitch, about how not enough people are flying.
You know what, though?
Not to get too far off the topic of games, except that I was supposed to be playing a bunch of them this weekend and didn't get to because of this.
Um...
Monty Boggs the thing is though that every time something like this happens like okay the SAC airport is not that big of an airport but this was I'm sure on the news wherever it is you live I know this was on the news in like Connecticut it was on CNN it was on MSNBC nobody died nobody was severely hurt like a few people were taken to the hospital but it's because a lot of whiplash type conditions because of the breaking of the plane and apparently people got rug burns from sliding down those inflatable slides
and those were the injuries that people had so it's unfortunate and it sucks but I've seen car accidents that were tons worse and you don't hear about every single car accident so I still think flying is pretty safe all things considered I'm glad the brakes decided to go when they did and not an hour later because I would prefer to just have stayed at home all weekend and not be in the hospital in Long Beach being treated for burns because I had to take a trip down the slide
However, if I did have to go down the slide, I'd at least grab a beer first like that guy did.
Beer is great.
Let me talk about actual games.
I had to talk about that because national news being right in front of me doesn't happen every day.
Games.
I've been playing Warcraft, of course, still working on my characters.
We're about halfway through Icecrown Citadel, which is cool, and the whole guild's gearing up, and it's cool.
But Cataclysm really needs to be out now.
I'm ready for it.
I think we all are.
I've been playing more Starcraft 2.
I've been just trying to go after some of the achievements a little bit and just playing the campaign a little bit here and there.
I'm progressing very slowly through that game, but considering I didn't even want to play it at first, I'm surprisingly having a really good time with that.
I do have a couple new games I want to talk about this week.
First off, out on PlayStation Network this week was an adaptation of Press Your Luck.
This game has already come out on the PC and the Wii, and I think there's an iPhone version as well.
But it came out on PlayStation Network this week, and it was really the first chance I had to check it out.
I have the DVD game from a few years ago, which I believe Jamie actually gave me as a gift a couple years ago.
I have that.
That's really the only version of the game I have to compare it to, which you can't compare a video game to a DVD game.
Sorry.
I never really played the Wii game I've only heard about it and I've only really heard about the PC game as well so I haven't really played them the PlayStation 1 it's okay like there's some really cool things and then there's some really not so cool things that really detract from it
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and then when you're actually playing the board sequences, it's a lot of fun.
Like, you know, your character's actually going, big bucks, big bucks, no whammies.
You know, they're actually saying it and the whammy animations are actually really well done.
That's actually probably the best thing about the adaptation.
I saw some on the trailer.
Yeah, the whammy, there's new stuff.
You know how there would always be pop culture tie-ins?
I always remember the little whammy that was like Boy George that would sing, do you really want a whammy?
I don't know why I remember this stuff from when I was like seven, okay?
But now they have like an American Idol whammy and some of these other like pop culture references and that's really cute.
That's cool.
But unfortunately, with these really high points, there's also a lot of like clunk.
The interface feels very clunky.
The shell around the game itself feels very rushed and just not flashy at all like a game show should be.
It feels very Facebook game to me.
The avatar designer is very disappointing, especially considering that you're playing on a PlayStation.
Why can't you just bring in my avatar from home?
You know, it has this whole system built into it, and maybe that's a Sony restriction, I don't know.
But it seems a little weird that you can't play with your actual avatars.
I tried to play the game online, could never find a room full of people to play it with, so didn't really get to test that.
And I think the questions in the game are really weird.
Like, it's just all the... There's no... You would think if I'm...
Press your luck on the PlayStation 3.
I would try to ask a lot of pop culture questions or questions geared towards 20 and 30 somethings.
But there's just a lot of like weird off the wall ancient history and obscure sports questions that seem to show up in there.
And it's kind of like, what?
Did they just go to a trivia book and yank all this shit out?
Like, I don't know.
probably what they did and there's a really weird like the single player mode is like playing through 16 episodes and your goal is to try and win each episode but the computer opponents have these different quirks so yeah weird but at the end of the day the game's only $10 so here's my thought
if you're bringing people over and you want to have laughs and you have three controllers and you want to have a fun little night this makes for a good board game substitute I don't think there's any substitute for an awesome board game like Clue or Monopoly or Catan or something like that but this is a fun little alternative you know I don't think it's anything I would take too seriously beyond that that's that's basically it for Press Your Luck um
Another game I've been playing this week is Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light, which is one of the new games that's on Xbox 360.
And I just want to give disclosure up front here.
A friend of mine actually worked on this game, so you may want to take what I'm about to say with a grain of salt, but I assure you that bears nothing on my opinion of this game.
And if I may say so, it was covered in last month's Retro Gamer.
Was it?
But it's not a retro game.
It just came out this week.
Oh, it must be because of the Tomb Raider history or whatever, maybe.
And there is a certain kind of retro-ish feeling about this game.
But as far as the game goes, I paid the $15 for it.
I played through the demo.
And I gotta say, it is awesome.
I think it is one of the better Xbox Live Arcade games to come out in a long time.
Here's the thing.
It doesn't really feel like Tomb Raider at all to me, and I think that's why they're not calling it Tomb Raider.
They're calling it this Lara Croft game, but I would honestly call it Gauntlet Legends is what it feels like more to me.
It's very arcade-feely with the score and the way the maps are and the isometric, but it's a good time.
I played through with Alan for about three hours on Friday night.
We were just kind of going through the different levels and the co-op is a lot of fun.
Like some of the puzzles are really cool.
Like there's all these different mechanics.
Like one of you plays as Lara Croft and she has a grappling hook that she can grab like little, I don't know, like little chains with.
She can grab them and then grapple over to them.
and then you can also play as Totec who is like an Aztec warrior and he can use a shield to either block projectiles or he can use the shield and hold it up and then Laura can jump on his shield or he can throw spears that then Laura can jump on.
So you really have to work together in order to be able to solve these different puzzles and it actually made for a lot of fun and we were kind of...
every level in that game it seems to end with this big climactic scene like for instance the end of the first level you think you're at the end and then all of a sudden the walls start to move and they they start to move in and it's going to push you over into the pit of spikes if you don't think quickly and you really have to work together like you have to jump up then you have to have Totec throw a spear you jump on the spear jump up use your grappling hook to grab Totec bring him up I mean it's
It sounds complicated the way I'm saying it, but it's all very fluid.
And the way it plays out, it executes a lot of fun.
And Alan and I are kind of yelling back and forth at each other like, no, no, no, do this, do this, do this.
And we actually fell in the spikes and died one time because we didn't have it together.
But then we figured it out the next time.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I don't know the rhyme or reason for that, but honestly, I was playing it in-house, and it was fine, and we had a lot of fun.
I could see, though, where it's really lacking if you had somebody you wanted to play with, but that'll be fixed in a couple weeks, I guess.
And then the other thing is that—oh, there's something else.
There's another drawback I was trying to think of.
Character models are nice.
and the single player mode what they do they give Laura the spear and then they alter some of the puzzles so that you can still do everything by yourself and I found myself playing through the first level like seven times this afternoon because there's all these different little mini objectives and one of them is a speed objective clear the level as fast as you can and there are lots of little shortcuts you have to take one of them is a points objective take it slow kill everything get all the points grab the diamonds
So it gives a lot of different reasons to replay the game.
So I think it's absolutely worth checking out.
I think it's one of the better games to come out in a while and makes me excited about Tomb Raider games again, which I never thought I'd say since like 1997.
Do you feel all tingly and brand new?
I guess so.
But I guess they're reinvigorating the regular franchise too and if it's anything like this it's going to be awesome.
So yeah, I'm a big fan of Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light.
Definitely check out the demo if nothing else.
Demo's the first level and it'll give you a feel for the game.
Salacious Pop is in chat and actually says that would give home some purpose.
Can't have that.
That's in reference to the avatars on PlayStation 3 Press Your Luck.
There you go.
Alright, chat.orangelandradio.com if you want to join us in our chat room and give your own comments.
Let's get into some housekeeping tonight and then we'll get into some actual gaming news.
Housekeeping tonight.
We've been talking about a marathon episode.
It was brought up last week and we were kind of joking like, should we really do this?
We're going to do it.
We are going to do a long extended marathon episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
It's going to start next week live at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.
It's going to start at 2 o'clock Pacific, 5 o'clock Eastern.
So it's a little bit earlier than usual.
And 10 o'clock in London.
That's right.
So this also is kind of that, those of you overseas that have been wanting to listen, here's your chance.
So we're going to go for two to five with our normal show, quote unquote.
And then after that, we're going to just keep going into the wee morning hours.
We're going to go into the vault.
We're getting some extensions from the mic so we can actually go into the vault, play some old classic games.
We're going to field a lot of comments from our chat room and kind of the listeners.
We want to know some discussion topics you want to talk about during that time.
We'll be kind of asking you guys.
Loki, unfortunately, because of, you know, the baby and the wife and everything, he's only going to be here for the...
DarkSakura
All right.
As late as it can.
And let's see.
Ranma says, woohoo, time to alcohol down.
We are actually thinking about doing at the top of every hour.
It's happy hour somewhere.
And we'll actually take a drink of whatever country it happens to be happy hour in.
So tune in.
It's going to be a good time.
There you go.
Alright, I think that's it for housekeeping.
I don't have a whole lot else.

There's been a few forum posts over the past few weeks that have been nice and so on.
Let's get into some actual gaming news now.
Loki, what is going on in the gaming world?
Lots of stuff this week.
Starting off in this kind of...
It's a little frustrating for me because I had the opportunity to participate in this.
Unfortunately, due to emails being eaten by a spam filter, I missed out, I think.
I could be wrong, though.
But the Connect beta is starting right now.
Apparently, if you are part of the Microsoft Connect program, which I am, you get the occasional survey and beta test announcements and that kind of stuff.
Well, they sent out invites to, I'm not sure if it's all the members or some of the members, but people are getting invites to the Kinect beta, which they would actually send them a Kinect motion camera, as well as some software to test out, and the new dashboard update that's going to be coming out this fall, which includes some other cool stuff, including some audio enhancements and stuff like that.
So hopefully that means that everybody doesn't sound like a little kid.
It's weird.
Sometimes when I'm out sick or something, or I have to take time off for my wife or the kid or whatever, and I play against my coworkers at work, they sound like little kids over the mics.
Even though that's not what they sound like on...
It's just really weird how badly the audio is distorted.
So I'm hoping that that actually gets better.
Isn't the Kinect device, doesn't it have a microphone on it too?
It does, yeah.
Is this supposed to be able to capture the room noise?
It does.
So maybe they're doing audio enhancements to kind of better, you know, for the room talking.
Like if I'm sitting way back on the couch and Kinect's all the way in the front of the room, like it's got to use a different type of audio sensory.
Yes and no, but the reason why they're doing the upgrade to that is before, it's kind of like how our radio station was before on Live 365 or even the podcast.
How before we were kind of catering towards low bandwidth, 64K type stuff.
Now they're updating that because most people have broadband and that's why.
I see.
They have more bandwidth to play with.
Oh, you know, it might also be the closure of original Xbox.
That's possible, because it says basically that the basic codec had originally required just a 64K connection, and it's time for us to move on.
Especially if we want to think about broadening a crackly headset on top of your head, not what people think about when they're talking about popular entertainment.
and you know I agree the audio quality should be better so that I can actually hear what people are saying instead of just hearing mumbling because that's what I hear a lot of times yeah if you go back and listen to old episodes of Orange Lounge Radio I mean they're out there there's information on the forums just remember guys it was a very different show in 2002
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
But basically, though, the beta testers will be getting, I guess, Connect Adventures, Connect Supports, and Connect Joyride beta versions of those as well.
And I do believe there's also a beta version of Dance Central as well that's being sent out because...
It's probably the five song demo that's been circulating.
Yeah, I think it's something similar to that.
So that'd be kind of cool.
And those are actually supposed to be sent out now.
You should have gotten an email letting you know that's going to happen.
Like I said, I didn't realize that I'd gotten this invite way back from like on the 8th.
So I just registered the other day.
but I'm crossing my fingers because not everybody that registers gets into it and I've been let into other beta programs so it would be nice because one, I like getting stuff early and two, I don't want to have to necessarily pay for this especially now with the baby and everything.
Well, just in case, Loki, this is for you for missing out.
There you go.
Thank you for that.
You're welcome.
Anytime.
What are friends for?
Go into our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
Tiger Claw says, Microsoft may improve the quality of the voice chat, but still have yet to improve the quality of the people behind the voice chat.
That is true.
It's true.
You will be able to hear all the horrible insults from 12-year-olds in high fidelity now.
Now you can hear F star star K, N I star star star, F star G, and all those wonderful words.
That would be awesome, though.
Yeah.
You know how they have the really bad voice dubbing in those made-for-TV, or not even necessarily made-for-TV, but how they have the television cable-friendly versions of movies and stuff?
The really bad ones where they'll actually change words to hot dog or kazoo or some weird-ass word.
It would be funny if they had some sort of algorithm to detect what people are saying and to kind of do that on the fly.
Uh, wasn't there a story?
I mean, it was some time ago, like a couple years ago, about a patent filed by... I want to say it was Microsoft.
It was a long time ago, but I want to say we talked about a story, because we had a good laugh at it, about that type of technology.
That it could actually understand the word fuck, and it would replace it.
And I don't know, like, part of me wants to say it came out the next week, that it was all a lie, it was a red herring, it was a joke, but...
I don't know.
I want to say that story was out there for some reason.
It was a while ago.
It would be funny, though.
It would be interesting if this might be the implementation of such technology.
Nah, I doubt it.
Huh?
Yeah.
Let's see.
Shadowrunner in our chat says, People still have dial-up.
I thought that died.
And Actdeft says, Dial-up still exists, believe it or not.
You know, a lot of people are still on dial-up.
My parents are still on dial-up.
They will not switch.
They say it's too expensive.
Some people live in the woods where everything is interrupted by trees
or something else to consider other countries like you know do you think some countries outside of America, Europe, Japan are as wired for I guess when I say Europe I mean Britain and the surrounding countries don't send your emails saying Europe is not a country but you know what I mean like a lot of those areas are regions if I should say are better wired for internet than others you know what I mean
So if Xbox is going to kind of ramp up the connection you need, they're kind of giving the finger to these people, right?
Not really, because you can't really play on Xbox Live with dial-up.
So, who cares?
But you can play with, like, can't you play with the satellite link?
Which isn't, it's faster than dial-up, but it's definitely not as fast as cable or even DSL, right?
We may have connection issues, because that's just like playing on our work, you know, network.
The connection's not very quick, and we get a lot of disconnects because of that.
But, it still works when it works, you know.
Ranma in our chat says, most ISPs are offering cable modem service for $19.99.
You know what?
I probably believe you.
I probably should help my parents price this.
But I kind of secretly think that my mom is just telling my dad it's too expensive because she knows that if they buy it, he'll be on the internet all the time.
But I'm also thinking my mother is starting to learn how to use the internet and use email.
So why wouldn't she want faster internet?
I don't know.
I guess you'll have to ask them.
So there you go.
Anything else about the Kinect program, Loki?
Anything else to know?
I mean, this is just around the corner at this point, right?
About two months away?
Well, the Kinect, yeah, is coming out November 4th.
The actual devices will be out as soon as Microsoft sends them out.
Let me ask this question.
Why are they doing a beta program for this?
It seems weird because we haven't heard of a lot of hardware beta tests.
I mean, the last one I can remember is the PlayStation 2 hard drive for Final Fantasy XI, but I don't hear of this a lot.
It's really kind of unusual for them to be doing a lot of these.
I would think it's just...
Word of mouth, maybe.
Getting people excited about it.
There's a vast amount of NDA items on there.
They're basically not wanting people to share what's included in the new dashboard update and all this stuff.
But people talk anyways, and I think that they realize that.
It's just kind of like, ooh, information I'm not supposed to know.
I'm more interested now.
Instead of just
So the whole thing is just a marketing thing.
But I'm sure at the same time, though, there is some troubleshooting stuff that they're probably doing.
Just seeing, hey, are there any bugs that we haven't thought of yet that maybe are in this that we could patch day one or something?
That kind of stuff.
But...
I'm curious how well that video chat works.
I just want one.
That's all.
Because I was actually kind of interested in the Kinect stuff.
The move I could care less about, but it would be kind of fun.
I would like to try out Dance Masters before it comes out so I don't look like a total tool trying to play the game.
Good luck with that.
I mean, you know, it's all...
Yes, I understand.
Yeah, there's a lot.
The thing is, when you look at choreographed dancing, it looks stupid if one person's doing it.
If a bunch of people are doing it at the same time, it looks cool because it's all in sync.
But when one person's doing it, it's not so cool.
You mean...
or Para Para Paradise exactly like one person playing that game usually looked a little bit ridiculous but when everybody would stand behind the machine doing the same dance like people would walk up like how do they know that what do they do what it's a cult that game is a cult it's a trap
Yeah, so that's the thing.
They're going to have the routines from the music videos for some of these songs.
And yeah, it'll be kind of cool.
You're going to have a bunch of people doing it.
But can you imagine a bunch of sober people doing this together?
I can't imagine that.
All I can imagine is, hey, I'm going to play Dance Masters, and everyone's going, ha ha, you look stupid.
You know what's going to be awesome is learning on Dance Central, let's say, how to dance to Poker Face.
Dance Central, I mean, not Dance Masters.
Dance Masters look stupid.
Well, whatever.
But let's say you learn the dance to, I don't know,
Poker Face Poker Face
Thanks for watching!
I digress.
I think any time you have a group of three or more all doing the same thing, no matter what it is, like in sync, it's going to be interesting.
I think it is.
At least... You look weird.
I mean, at least be... It kind of reminds me of when I used to go to the club a long time ago.
There was a guy that looked like he... It was literally like some grandpa dressed up like Michael Jackson doing stuff, and it didn't matter what he was doing.
It's interesting because you're like...
That's something I don't see every day.
And that's the other thing, too.
I mean, it'll get people's attention.
And really, going to clubs, that's all what it's about.
It's getting people's attention.
Because, you know, that's what you crave.
I don't know how often you've been to gay bars, Loki, but that's like all the people there on the dance floor.
All that old man in the thriller outfit.
Like, it takes a lot to stand out like that at a gay bar.
It really does.
The one I remember is this fierce old drag queen that used to wear a leotard looking like Jane Fonda out of the 1980s.
They used to do goth dancing to pop songs.
That was unique.
That is unique.
That's plenty of genres right there.
That's right.
Well, you know, America's the melting pot, so...
That sounds divine.
There will be interest in Dance Central because look at how well Just Dance did.
That came out of fucking nowhere.
Just Dance is top of the charts for weeks.
It's still a really popular Wii game.
Where the hell did that come from?
So if that has that kind of popularity and we get the kind of support from Harmonix with this,
It'll be awesome.
Which, if they're given money, you know they will.
Yes, I'm hoping the support's awesome.
On the other hand, Dance Masters, Konami promises download content, but I have yet to see them actually come through with the download content.
We'll see, we'll see.
You never know.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
It does have a pretty extensive song library, I gotta say.
I was surprised, because I was expecting the library to be nothing but the same old damn songs from 4th Mix, 5th Mix, Max, Max 2, Extreme.
You know, all the same old songs, but it wasn't.
There was a lot of different stuff in there.
I know You Can't Touch Us is actually in DDRX, and I think Just Dance might be in one of the newer They probably are from other DDR games, but I was just surprised that they were licenses.
No matter what it is, they are commercial songs.
You know, they are still coming out with Dance Dance Revolution.
Remember how they were going back to Dance Dance Revolution to make it really confusing?
For the PS3 and the Wii.
It's the Move one.
Oh, they're different games.
Dance Dance Revolution on the Wii is just an extension of Hottest Party.
They're not saying it, but it's the same old balance board mode and all that stuff.
And then the one on the PS3 is the move.
And then the 360 is not getting DDR, it's getting Dance Masters.
That's how it's working.
Yeah.
There it is.
All right.
Hope you wrote down what I said really fast if you need an explanation.
And something you could use to write down real fast is a peripheral we talked about last week on the show, the U-Draw.
Remember this?
Nice segue.
Yeah, that's awesome, huh?
The U-Draw was the third-party tablet that they were, I believe THQ was making it to do like a Pictionary game, and there was another game that they were making with this.
Well, there's Adventure, and there's also some actual drawing game that comes with the tablet.
I'm glad someone was paying attention last week.
All right, well, there's a rumor out this week, and it's being run on GoNintendo.com, which, you know, they love their Nintendo over there.
I guess they have a tipster who says they have inside info on the U-Draw.
And I'm thinking if I'm GoNintendo, I don't run with this unless I know that there is some clout to this.
They've been around a little while.
So here's the quote.
Both games, talking about Nintendo themselves getting into making games for the U-Draw, are designed with the mass market gamer in mind, yet honor the passion of traditional gamers.
And of course, one of the huge speculations right off the bat, Mario Paint.
Finally, a new Mario Paint on the Wii.
Could it really be happening?
That'd be awesome.
GoNintendo also speculates Kirby Canvas Curse, perhaps.
Although, honestly, insert any DS game here.
They can make an adaptation for it on the Wii.
I don't know if they would do another Kirby game that soon after Kirby's Epic Yarn, but...
But if they're making it now, it probably wouldn't be out until next Christmas, right?
I want a Mario Paint, and I want the music mode.
I think a Mario Paint would be great, although I believe it's one of those games you sort of see through retro-colored glasses where it was awesome when you were 12, but now it's... But the music mode was pretty rad.
And there's still like a cultish community for that.
There's an emulator for just the music mode.
Okay, imagine if they brought back Mario Paint.
Just...
DarkSakura.com
DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
What a concept!
you have those SD cards that you can put in the slot on the Wii, imagine if the chiptune music making mode in this hypothetical Mario Paint game that I've completely made up, you could export MP3s to the SD card, oh my god it wouldn't be MP3s, oh my god it would be AAC files because remember they don't support MP3s anymore, okay fine, AACs then still, still it'd be amazing
and while you're at it you release a DS version or a DSi version that comes out as well where not only can you draw stuff but you can take pictures of things and then you know edit them and do all that fun stuff alright well what do you guys think the other game could possibly be Mario Paint I think is the number one fanboy request what would be the other one if you were making a game for Udraw in a Nintendo franchise what do you think it could be
Magic Pen Gel It's on Nintendo franchise That would be awesome Maybe if Nintendo made an RPG or something like that I don't think I played That game was so sweet Graffiti Kingdom, I remember that came out That was pretty awesome too, but I didn't play that very much
I'm gonna say the other drawing game is a generic Wii blank game.
Like, Wii Party, Wii Sports, Wii... One of those, what's the island called now that they have all these games on, and the Wii Fit?
There's gonna be a Wii Draw.
That's the other Nintendo, it's just Wii Draw.
Of course, then again, that would just be Mario Paint, wouldn't it?
So maybe that's what you're getting instead of Mario Paint.
What if they had it where you can play Pikmin on it or something like that?
Ah, now you're talking.
Or like an RTS of some sort.
A recreation of the stylus.
Like with DS games.
Imagine how much easier, by the way, playing Cooking Mama on the Wii would be.
With a U-Draw.
Yeah, perhaps.
Well, you know, it's not Cooking Mama anymore.
It's Crafting Mama.
That's the next one.
The other thing I wanted to say about this real quick.
Isn't it weird, though, that you have a first-party person supporting a third-party device?
Like, if Nintendo was planning on making games for this, wouldn't they just suddenly say, me?
Maybe we want to buy this and make it a first-party peripheral.
It seems weird to me that THQ is putting this out, but Nintendo is supporting it.
These things are supposed to work in reverse.
Not necessarily, because they could just team up with them and have it actually where they release the peripheral.
It'll probably be bundled with one of their games.
If they came out with a MarioPay, for example, it would be bundled with the UDraw tablet.
It's just made by third parties.
It's kind of like... Well...
DarkSakura, speaking of firsts, she hasn't gotten to give us a news story tonight yet.
Okay, how about some stuff for Red Dead Redemption?
A.K.A.
Grand Theft Horse.
And I hate that these stupid ads on the side that they want to completely cover the entire page and not give me the little button to close the damn thing.
There.
Anyway, this is for Red Dead Redemption.
The Liars and Cheats Pack has a date in the UK.
And for the PS3 and 360, it will be released on the 21st of September.
It will be £7.99 on PlayStation Network and 800 Microsoft Points.
That's roughly €9.60 in Euros.
So...
It was going to be free, but they've decided to make it super nice, and then they can give away free packs.
Anyway, it's going to have different multiplayer modes.
One called Stronghold, where you take turns as attack and defense.
Multiplayer horse races, poker, liar's dice, an explosive rifle, gang hideouts, hunting grounds.
and 15 of the characters in story mode will be playable character skins.
So that's cool.
So Loki, you play a lot of Grand Theft Auto at work and DarkSakura made a joke calling it Grand Theft Horse.
Why do you think Red Dead Redemption hasn't caught on with your little crowd?
Thanks for watching!
to a deathmatch location on the map, and then you have to trigger it and invite your other people in there.
And if it's anything like the times we've tried to set up before, the game's really dumb as far as setting up games.
Like, for example, we set up a deathmatch one time, and I invited everybody, they accepted, and it started loading the game, and then we ended up in the three separate deathmatches where we were the only player there.
I was like, what the hell?
So, that's why we don't play Red Dead Redemption right now.
We've been just playing Grand Theft Auto.
You know, it's fun to stick with.
Plus, they're really itching for me to get the mod game back up again so we can play that again.
Because that was some of the best games we've ever played.
and the best part about it is the guy that made one of the mod tools open for they have a beta version that's out there now that I signed up for the beta for that and the new version allows us to edit the files for Red Dead Redemption.
Make your own expansion pack.
But it's a very different format so that's something I need to explore.
I have to dump it to my hard drive first but it'll be interesting to check that out.
I also had another bit for this story as well.
For Red Dead Redemption there's a rumor going around that they're casting for the movie and asked Brad Pitt.
Wow, I just saw that comment from TigerClaw in our chatroom too.
It was saying that at chat.orangecountry.com.
He said, oh yeah, you heard that Brad Pitt might star in a Red Dead Redemption movie.
Why does that sound like fanboy wank to me?
It sounds like fanboy wank to me.
Well, according to this, they've given him first refusal on it.
So, I don't know.
You know, I also heard, I saw on LiveJournal or somewhere that apparently they cast, what's his name from Lost, Matthew Fox as the main guy in Mass Effect, which I guess they're making an actual movie out of.
And I looked at that and I said, boy, that sounds like Fanboy Wank.
I didn't even know they were going to make a legitimate Mass Effect movie.
I thought they would wait until the trilogy is done.
But...
Maybe they're going to try to release it at the same time?
I don't know.
Well, I have to check and see.
I didn't read the show roll all the way yet, but there was another movie thing that I don't remember if we're talking about it or not.
Uh...
I don't think so.
I don't think so.
If we spoil it, we spoil it.
Oops.
Whatever, okay.
Honestly, I am not familiar with this series because I don't own an iPhone or something like that, but was it Big Angry Bird or something like that?
Oh, yeah.
I've heard of Angry Birds.
Angry Birds.
So they're supposed to be making a movie out of that.
That sounds dumb, but I don't know.
Interesting.
I don't know what kind of game you'd make out of that, but whatever.
I think what it's come down to is the movie industry is really hurting for original ideas, so now they're trying to just develop everything into a movie.
A perfect example of that is the whole Hasbro licensing with the Ouija game, the movie, or Battleship the movie, or Monopoly the movie.
They did Ouija the movie.
It was called The Exorcist.
or this nonsense that they're remaking Clue the movie.
They're not remaking the 80s version of Clue which will always be a timeless classic.
They're just going to make a new movie based off a Clue that'll be I'm sure it's wonderful of a piece of cinema as the Clue 2 Murder in Disguise VCR game where you get to see Mr. Green dressed up as Madam Rose.
It was quality cinema.
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
and it is being dealt with swiftly by Sony as well.
It was confirmed, I guess, by a bunch of different sources that despite the fact that one video showed it running on a dev console, it is actually the real deal.
It's actually sold out as well.
And, of course, it goes without saying that Sony, they say they have a way to detect whether you're running it or not, and they will ban you.
So, buyer beware, I suppose.
And apparently, I guess the device is kind of similar to the Pandora battery that was on the PSP.
Thanks for watching!
and Sony Australia has granted a temporary injunction by the federal court to block the importation and sale of the new mod chips as well.
It is a temporary injunction, means until August 31st.
So during that time, actually Sony will have, I guess...
They're the only ones that they can be sold to, and I'm not sure if they actually get to seize the hardware or whatever.
But this device wasn't made in Australia, right?
This isn't made in Australia, but Oz Modchips was one of the first modchip resellers that had these chips.
So...
I don't know.
I guess it blocks something.
We'll see.
August 31st is a couple days away.
Especially if they aren't granted an extension on that, you better believe it.
They're going to kick that shit out of the door immediately.
Or you could just import one from the US, Canada, Switzerland, right?
Exactly.
So, unless, unless, and I don't know, unless maybe they were the first ones to get it, and then those companies are buying it from Osmodchips, who knows.
And so, of course, you have the, basically, the temporary injunction does halt the sale to anyone but Sony.
Apparently...
They are legally forced to sell the PS jailbreaks to Sony.
And in any case, I guess they have a chance to figure out how the thing works.
In the meantime, I'm sure that they could buy one anyways.
They probably will try to figure out how it works.
And if anything, it probably works very similar to the way their dev kit stuff works.
and then of course the reason why they're trying to or they got the temporary injunction anyways is saying that apparently the device uses some sort of code that's from the dev kit or something like that that is proprietary and that it's violating whatever of course whoever is making these chips actually are saying that they don't use any of that stuff
and they aren't too worried by what's going on.
They're saying there was kind of a short back and forth Q&A with them.
It says companies in Australia get a lot of problems.
Sony halts Australian resellers.
Is this a big problem?
And it says it's a temporary injunction until August 31st.
We'll be reached then.
Nothing illegal has been done.
It's just a scare tactic.
and it says there's no copyright code and we have not interfered with any intellectual property laws.
The device is designed for homebrew, nothing illegal.
I guess you can say nothing illegal, but obviously it can be used both ways.
The product is very different from every other mod.
Nothing illegal.
Once again, reinforcing that.
Yes, but all these shops returning customers' money back.
People informed saying the order's canceled.
It says it's just a scare tactic.
It's obviously working.
It will work in Europe also.
Yeah.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Thank you for watching!
We'll see.
Like I said, I have one on order for the hell of it because I like to get everything, especially stuff that people don't want me to have.
Nice rationale.
Whatever.
I don't have to justify it.
I spend plenty of money on games.
I have one on order and I'm not worried about it.
Like they said, if for some reason Sony does put some permanent injunction and prevents them from selling it, I get my money back.
If they don't, I get a mod chip.
I don't see how I lose out in this scenario.
It's not a big deal.
All right.
Well, I don't know if the jailbreak will help out with this situation if it's adopted by Sony, but it's something that's becoming more and more popular.
We've talked about it quite at length on this show.
It's the online pass.
Yeah, you remember that?
It's showing up in the EA Sports Games now, and I think THQ, Ubisoft supposedly is putting this on board.
And if you don't remember what the online pass is, it's where you pay $10 if you buy the game used for a code so that you can actually play the game online and unlock other features.
It's locked out if you don't have the code.
Obviously, if you buy the game new, it comes with a code.
Well, guess what company is supposedly getting on board?
Sony.
That's right, Sony themselves for their first party games.
This is a comment from Sony Computer Entertainment Europe, Andrew House.
Quote, Because of mod chips like this.
I mean, think about it.
That's one way.
Well, we'll prevent people from getting online because they won't have access to a code to get online.
Therefore, you know, enticing people to buy games.
Now, of course, this story made rounds all over the Internet because, you know, hearing Sony's going to jump on board gets, you know, people's ears perked.
But I like this particular perspective on it that was on Destructoid.
One of their authors over there when they ran the story said this.
I thought this was very good.
Again, this is from Destructoid.com.
quote, it seems that this is most certainly the future of online play.
Buy new or pay for it.
I still think it's ludicrous.
The industry relies more on trading credit than I think any publisher will want to admit.
And if trade-in values are diminished because of this, well, good luck trying to compete in an already competitive market when gamers find themselves even less able to afford your $60 luxuries.
And sums it up with this, the author does, if used games disappeared tomorrow, the market would crash.
I guarantee it.
I think that's true.
He makes an interesting point.
It's a really interesting point.
Well, it is an interesting point and here's my point to it right now.
As of right now, the stuff that they seem to be targeting is sports games.
I don't know if you're a sports gamer or if you should take offense to that because really they're the ones that they seem to be targeting because right now it's just UFC 2010, Tiger Woods 2011, NCAA 11, Madden 11, and then of course SmackDown vs. Raw 11.
Those are all if you would consider sports titles right now and they're also talking that this is going to be done in I guess MLB The Show 11.
Yeah.
It's interesting that you say that because Ranma in our chatroom at chat.orange.online.com says, I have no problem with the online pass since they're just for sports games.
Once it passes to non-sports games, then I'll have a problem with it.
It seems to me there's different types of gamers too.
You have people that buy their systems, their consoles, and this is a significant amount of people for nothing but Madden, NBA, and a lot of those games that Loki named save for the occasional Halo, Call of Duty, and those types of mega games.
And then you have kind of the gamers like I think the majority of the people that listen to our show that like to play some of the more
And of course, there's some crossovers.
I'm not saying none of you like to play sports games.
Even I like Double Dribble and Blades of Steel and some of those old school sports games.
But you know what I mean.
Like, you know, there definitely is kind of two factions of gaming, if you will.
So it is interesting that only this one seems to be impacted so far by this.
And something I would like to add is a story that didn't make our show roll, but I thought it was very interesting.
Ballsy of them to be making this sort of argument, but THQ basically called people that buy used games cheaters.
Like they're cheating the devs out of their hard-earned money or something.
That's...
That's ridiculous.
That's just kind of an ignorant argument.
I'm trying to see where they're coming from, but that's very ignorant to the world we live in because does Paramount Pictures and 20th Century Fox say that about used DVD sales and used Blu-ray sales?
What is a garage sale?
Is a garage sale a cheating...
Party.
I mean, selling your old shit is a part of American culture.
Here's what I don't understand that they're complaining anyways because here's the thing.
When they've sold it to their retailer, they've already sold their copies to the retailer.
They have their money.
It's up to the retailer to decide, hey, if people are buying used copies, then that sucks for me because I still have this new copy on the shelf or something like that.
But I don't...
THQ's Corey Ledesma said, I don't think we really care whether used game buyers are upset because new game buyers get everything.
So if used game buyers are upset that they don't get online features set, I don't really have much sympathy for them.
That's a little blunt, but we hope it doesn't disappoint people.
We hope that people understand that when the game is used, we get cheated.
I don't see how you get cheated because there's still the same amount of people playing your damn game that there were before.
I don't understand how that you're cheated.
And if anything, say someone buys it used and they like it, then they go out and buy the next version.
Say, you know, I bought Saints Row 1 used or something like that, and I'm like, whoa, this is an awesome game.
And then Saints Row 2 comes out, I buy it new day one.
I don't understand how they lose out on this, but I'll tell you something, I'm not fucking buying your sports games, so...
whatever and I'll tell you what man I'll think twice about buying your other games if you have this kind of crap or the U-Draw which we talked about earlier in the show well the U-Draw is not going to have that because Wii doesn't really do online stuff too much and that's not really what they're going after but
It's still retarded to think that... It's still the same company.
And they've made excuses left and right.
Oh, we get cheated out of stuff.
Well, wait a second.
You get cheated because you're not selling a new copy and so you're trying to entice people to buy new copies?
But I thought before you were saying that you needed this extra money to support your online services that you're now providing extra options for.
Oh, wait, but now you're just saying that it's because all these used sales are really cutting into your profits.
Be glad you're selling copies at all because if you keep this kind of attitude up, you know, hey, let me tell you this much.
It hasn't helped Activision too much.
I got to go to our chat room, chat.orange.com.
Ranma just kind of takes one glove off and slaps THQ across the face saying, no, the companies that market the games at $59.99 are cheaters.
and the other thing too is on top of all that stuff calling these people cheaters and stuff you're putting out these sports games and I don't want to make generic you know I don't want to put out generic opinions of these sports games but a lot of people kind of agree that a lot of times these are just kind of roster updates that they put out each year and well to be fair it's the way that that faction looks at music games exactly and don't get me wrong I mean a lot of music games out there especially the Guitar Freak series
is just a different song list each year, and that's it.
But, I mean, it's not like vast improvements between each game.
And the fact that they're saying, oh, well, we want you to pay extra money for this.
Oh, and then we have this download content that could have been added in there for free, but we want a little bit more money.
And, oh, now you bought a used, so now you have to pay for online access.
But guess what?
Maybe the used players will learn not to really give a shit about the online access.
Then what are you gonna do?
Oh, look, they bought all your used games, you're still getting cheated, and they're not buying your stupid, you know, internet access.
Let me get to other chatroom comments.
Actdeft in our chatroom says, Don't know, the used DVDs and Blu-ray market ain't that big.
Keep in mind, he's in another country, so I don't know if...
If that changes the perspective, I mean, I think if there's a store here that does nothing but sell used DVDs and that sort of thing.
I can tell you right now that the studios don't like used sales because at one time we were buying, because, you know, Redbox and stuff, they turn over their DVDs quite quick and they have to offload all that used product.
Well, we used to buy it and then turn around and sell it.
DarkSakura.com
um Actdeft goes on to say they're cheated out of the money they should have supposed to get with the sale of the new game uh let's see Ranma says I'm sorry THQ wrestling games are not sports games since WWE and so on is sports entertainment Satellite Minded says people are already paying to play games online why do they have to pay more for content that's on the disc and Tiger Claw says it all comes down to one word greed and I agree and you know what um it's kind of funny though like
If Microsoft did this, I think there would be a shit storm because people are already paying for online access and they'd be like, why the fuck do I have to pay for more online access?
It's probably why they don't.
It's probably smart to do this.
Let's see how it plays out over there.
It's not a popular idea.
I just don't think it's necessary.
Here's what you need to do.
It's so simple and a lot of times they're doing it already, but
All you gotta do is just sell download content, you know?
You don't even necessarily have to, you know, cut stuff out of your game, but just support it with download content and you'll make a lot of money back, whether they bought it new or used.
If they bought it new, great, you make that sale and you make additional money, but if they bought it used, they're still buying download content.
and I don't see how you lose out of that because that's digital.
It's pure profit pretty much.
All right.
Let's move on.
We spent a lot of time on this topic.
We've got a lot more stories to cover.
Speaking of legal things, I believe DarkSakura's got a more legally oriented story for us that could also be setting a precedent soon for the future of games.
That I do.
There is a case that was... The U.S.
Supreme Court is going to be reviewing Schwarzenegger vs. the Entertainment Merchants Association.
about a law that they're trying to get passed here that would put fines on renting or selling violent games to kids.
The way they're trying to get around the First Amendment rule is that they're easier to get their hands on and would cause more immediate harm than seeing it through TV movies or the internet.
How is buying a video game easier than TV?
You turn a box on.
That astounds me.
That's a bold argument.
It's dumb.
I don't understand why they're making this argument.
Wasting time on issues that really don't need to be even focused on.
The rest of the issue, too, is that while there are rules protecting minors from sexual imagery, there's not too many about violence.
The way that I see that is, again, it's scapegoatism.
Easy target, let's put everything on the video games and absolve the parents of their responsibility.
Exactly, that's all it is.
Because if the parents aren't going to be responsible, then the government's got to be responsible for the kids, right?
Because that's the stance that they want to take.
I think it's absolutely stupid that they're going to have laws.
They're even going to...
Really, I think it might be a way to generate some revenue for the states or whatever, just so they can find these people and make some extra money.
Maybe that's why they're driven to do this, but I don't see... I think it's really up to the parent to decide what's appropriate for their children.
Agreed.
If they want to play violent video games, then that's fine.
Halo, an M-rated game, I don't think that's really that bad.
I think a...
Adolescent kid can handle that kind of stuff because it's really sci-fi.
Now, Manhunt or something like that, that's a little different, but it's all what you decide is appropriate for your child.
I know I've brought this up before, but have you seen that episode in Season 7 of Bullshit where they talked about video games and they had you-know-who
DarkSakura,
and they take the kid out to go shoot an actual gun a real gun his mom's there they've got cops there everything's cool kid shot the gun once and didn't want to touch it again and it had him reduced to tears so
Clearly, there is a difference.
You know, if you play a game, you know, a violent game on the TV or even a little gun game on the TV versus shooting an actual firearm.
I've gotten into a similar thing on this show.
You know, I enjoy the occasional, you know, Quake, Unreal Tournament and shooting game.
But I don't like guns at all.
I don't ever want one in my house.
I'm against them for me.
I realize there's a second amendment.
If other people want to have them, that's their right.
But for me, I hate guns, like real ones.
But I like gun games.
But see, it's totally...
It doesn't teach you how to kill people.
No, it doesn't.
If anything, it teaches you maybe tactics and stuff like that, but in the end, it doesn't teach you how to actually fire the weapon or use the weapon or anything like that.
And the human mind is going to be far more creative than an AI in a game would be.
Let me get to our chatroom, chat.orange.com.
Frisbee wants to know, California residents, when does Arnold leave the governor's seat?
January, I believe.
And ironically enough, just a couple days after this is heard is the election.
And it's past the primaries, and it's down to the Meg Whitman's, the former CEO of eBay.
She's the Republican.
And then you have Jerry Brown, who was the governor of California in the late 70s, early 80s.
But because term limits didn't go in until after he was in office, he's able to run again.
So it's a very interesting matchup.
Very interesting.
And neither one I like.
That's the way a lot of people in this state feel.
I hate her a lot just because of her campaign right now because it's just smear, smear, smear, smear, smear.
For a lot of people I talk to, it's who do you dislike less.
I've made up my mind but I'm also a one issue kind of person and both candidates have made it pretty clear where they stand on the issue so I know where I'm voting.
my absentee ballot should be coming before too long are you voting for Bill the Cat?
no but keep in mind that I vote absentee every time I vote so that I can make a photocopy of my vote and then mail in my original so that it can't be tampered with but that's me
Well, the other thing I was going to say, too, in response to the whole violent video game things, and we've also brought this up, too, is that the rate of violence has gone down in minors since, or at least gun-related violence, I think, or armed violence has gone down since 1991, you know, when the Nintendo popped up.
Another thing too, and this just has to go to guns in general, is I think that a lack of exposure opens up the door, I think, for putting people in danger.
Because it's actually a proven statistic that in those gun-free zones, you know what I'm talking about, that the rate of gun-related violence is higher.
Because anyone... People always want what they can't have?
DarkSakura.com
who won't be armed.
They won't be armed.
It makes people a target.
If you know in a place you're going to go somewhere where you've got a likely chance that they're going to be following the rules there, you've got an easy target.
It's the states where people are allowed to carry firearms on them that they have the lowest amount because an armed society is a polite society.
These are related, trust me.
But
If you can establish this difference, make them something that someone's exposed to and say, hey, this is a dangerous object.
You shouldn't be using this.
This is not the same thing as this.
When you give them item A and item B to compare, then I think that that level of exposure is going to put it in pretty early.
Oh, well, this is not reality.
I don't have to be afraid of this.
You know what I mean?
And I know a lot of people can distinguish between what's real and what's not real, even kids, and I think a lot of times they just...
That's what they blame.
If they're not blaming video games for violence, they're blaming guns for violence.
The problem is, no one's ever calling these people out and saying, especially these court cases, they go, oh, the video game made me do it, and the judge just doesn't go, take some goddamn responsibility for yourself.
There's a few that have been thrown out, actually, lately, because they chalked it up to parental negligence.
It'll be interesting to see how the Supreme Court goes on this one though because it definitely will set a precedent, if nothing else.
Well, and though they're going to have to go by previous precedent set, like what was that public decency thing that ended up being a free speech?
You know, there was in Florida, there's a boob march every year, and it's allowed to go through as freedom of expression.
If we can have boobs flapping around in humidity...
I think that we can have a little... Wet boobs?
I think we can have a little headshot, don't you think?
I support this and I think that this should expand across the country.
I support this.
I agree.
Loki's like, why are we talking about games?
Let's talk more about the boob march.
It was something having to do with people who, you know, were...
DarkSakura.com
I just don't want to see your boobies.
That's why they make shawls and covers.
I'm being difficult.
No, no, I want to see.
Whatever.
I don't need to go in there.
She's just like, I don't want to show you anyway.
All right.
My boobs are epic.
Moving on.
We've got a lot of show in the interest of time.
We've got to get on release dates.
Let's talk about what violent games are coming to a store near you this week.
Start with the U.S.
Not really many violent games this week.
And it's not too much.
of a release week.
It is going to start ramping up though very soon, but there are some decent things.
There's a re-release of Battlefield Bad Company 2, the Ultimate Edition with some download content there for both Battlefield Bad Company 2 and Battlefield 1943 in there as well.
Valkyria Chronicles 2 on the PSP.
Gunblade New York City and LA Machine Guns on the Wii this week.
Metroid Other M on the Wii this week, which is
awesome Camp Rock the final jam on the DS tying in with the movie that's coming out and I hope they really do mean final because I don't care for those Camp Rock games or anything with Disney as far as our TV shows go Guilty Party on the Wii it wants to be Clue but it's just not Prison Tycoon Alcatraz I think a lot of this stuff was delayed from last week because I remember reading a bunch of this
The Mumbo Jumbo Six Pack Second Edition with a bunch of different Mumbo Jumbo puzzle and card games in there as well.
And what probably is going to be a really shitty game, We Wish You a Merry Christmas for the Wii.
It's fucking August.
I think that's a re-release because honestly, yeah, it is a re-release and it's $10 now.
And trust me, it's not worth $10.
That is it.
Next week will be some good stuff though.
Let's go over to Japan and check out what's coming out over there.
A lot of price reductions this week on the Xbox.
Left 4 Dead 2, Halo 3 ODST, Modern Warfare 2, and Bayonetta all going into the Platinum Collection over there in Japan.
And those are really the only releases to look forward to this week.
It's kind of a similar situation where we're just kind of waiting for the big rush at the end of the year which will start any day now.
Moving on to the PlayStation 3, same thing, lots of price reductions, but that includes NBA Live 10, Need for Speed Shift, FIFA Soccer 10, World Class Soccer, Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2, and Bayonetta.
That's on the PlayStation 3.
Again, these are Japanese releases or price reductions as the case may be.
as things move into the Platinum Series over there.
Looking at the Nintendo Wii, big releases over there this week.
Just Metroid Other M gets its release on September 2nd, so it's coming out over there this week as well.
They didn't really get it earlier or later, just a couple days later, I guess, if you want to be technical.
PlayStation 2 doesn't have a whole lot going on.
There is a new FIFA Soccer 10 coming out there, and Shin Sangoku Musou 5 Special gets a price reduction, if you're into that.
Cthulhu Saves the World Xbox 360
There are so many things wrong with that because Cthulhu never really saves anything unless it's saving by cleansing all humanity off of the world.
But maybe that's coming out on 360 this week.
Maybe an Xbox Live Arcade game.
I don't know.
Who knows?
But that's an awesome name.
All right.
Also in Japan this week on the Nintendo DS, a game called Nintama Rantaru.
Gakunen Taikosuen Puzzle No Dawn
then lastly going on to the Sony PSP and seeing if anything is coming out over there worth mentioning Bleach, Heat the Soul 7 because you know you've missed your Bleach games so there's another one coming out on PSP this week also a game called White Breath Perfect Edition comes out this week as well on the PSP
It's called White Breath.
It is an adventure game.
Trying to figure out if it's a dating sim or what.
It's another one of those kind of like read and respond to the characters as they're talking to you.
There's so many Japanese games that look like this.
But you can choose.
It looks like there's a music mode.
There's a music song called Slapstick.
Yeah, whatever.
There you go.
Those are your releases in Japan this week.
How about Europe?
We do have some goodies in Europe.
On the 31st, Bioshock 2 Minerva's Den on PS3, PC, Xbox 360.
Dead Rising 2 Case Zero on Xbox 360.
On September 3rd we have Metroid Other M and Tom Clancy's Hawk 2 and Valkyria Chronicles.
So that's going to be a week of excitement.
Alright, just a few more news stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week.
All right.
Let's see.
There's some other cool stuff here.
It's interesting.
This week there was a lot of talk about used game stuff, despite the fact THQ thinks you're all cheaters for buying used games.
But apparently some of their direct customers are going to be cheaters as well.
Target is actually buying used games.
They started their used game buying program.
It's actually kind of taking place right now in Northern California, but they're going to be rolling out 850 stores by the year's end.
I'm not really sure how that program works, but that'll be interesting.
Best Buy Best Buy
Well, now they've actually begun doing used game trade-ins as well.
And they also have, I guess, $20 gift cards for select titles.
If you, you know, buy or trade in a certain game, they'll give you $20, I guess, addition.
And, oh, I guess they'll give you $20 instead of the title's trade-in value.
But, hey, $20 for games sometimes is pretty good.
and um so yeah it's interesting so I'm sure if these guys you know start doing this that probably other retailers especially if they're successful with it will won't be too far behind and then everybody will be cheaters and what will you think then THQ I think they'll probably poop themselves uh anybody planning to take advantage of these programs
No, not really.
Episode 2, Two Households
They're saying it will have better pathfinding, the option to switch between extended and short narration, a new walking animation, more subtitle options, and widescreen support.
So I guess it sounds like they've taken a lot of feedback from the first game and implemented it.
So that's really cool.
In a related story, the website GOG.com, G-O-G.com or goodoldgames.com, they're having a Keen's Quest 1 through 3 bundle selling right now for $9.99.
There's also a pack with 4, 5, and 6 bundles.
with the same price.
You ever looked at GOG.com?
They actually have quite a few old, old games for sale on there and a good way to get legitimate what I've seen called abandonware before when people just put up old games because they say it's old and no one cares about it anymore.
As long as it's not Game.com.
No, it's not that.
I had one of those and the taco and got rid of them both.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura.com
This is the theme music from the game.
Okay.
Now, play the theme music from the anime.
Play the theme music from the anime.
I can do that.
Okay.
Because I'm prepared here for a change.
That's actually one of the best qualities I have that I can play into.
Now, does the gun look familiar?
Yes, the gun does look familiar.
Wow.
You can link that in the chat room.
Sure, I'll link this in the chat room.
Okay.
Okay.
The game and the anime Zillion came out as companions to each other.
I'm going to switch and do some play of the game.
Sorry, didn't mean to cut you off.
That's cool.
Game actually in Japan, its full name is Akai Kodan Zillion, which is Red Photon Zillion.
And it kind of is Metroid-ish.
It came out though before then, I believe.
It was out in 1987 for the Sega Master System.
And there was a sequel called Zillion 2, The Triformation.
It also had things in common with Impossible Mission, too.
Basically, the general story, you play a group called the White Knights, and you have to go get rid of this base on Planet X. So you play...
Main dude, JJ, and you rescue Apple and Champ, who are the other guys.
Keep in mind, early anime.
Just real quick, don't want to cut you off, but since you brought it up, August 6th, 86 was Metroid.
Okay, so then it was afterwards.
All right.
Anyway, you have to go past tripwires, turrets, forcefields, a bunch of enemy guards, including in some places they kind of run in like Metal Gear style.
You hear the little alert noise.
So it's pretty cool.
J.J.
is like a nice balance in between them.
There's also a glitch in the game that you can become invincible by dying when you go into a room-to-room elevator, but you can't go to your status menu.
The only way you can switch characters is when you find a new teammate.
And of course, remember this is the Master System, it is kind of inconvenient to go pause your game on the system like it was back in the day.
Um...
But the music is, of course, a lot the same music from the anime.
And the one where you go in and out of their main ship, it plays the opening theme from the anime.
And it plays it when the Sega label goes off.
And then...
It's pretty cool.
It's got a soundtrack called Akai Kodanzillion Let It Rock, which I have.
Just saying.
And the anime's pretty good, too, actually.
But the game is... It's got a lot of different special messages in it, and you have... The way that you go through those rooms is that you have these little pods that you have to blow up and get a character out of, and then you input them into a computer.
And the characters don't have to be in any particular order, by the way.
and then you'll get like some special codes that will summon, you know, will turn off the tripwires or something and they do other stuff.
This more reminds me of Impossible Mission.
That's what I said earlier.
I said that it has a lot in common with Impossible Mission.
Yeah, yeah.
Just having looked at this for a little bit now, yeah.
But keep in mind, this is a pretty, pretty sweet game.
And it doesn't have a save function, sadly.
Dan left his game paused while he was playing it for hours on end so he could do other stuff.
But I'd have to say it's among the list of, you know, one of my favorites.
And also keep in mind, there's a little guest star in Zillion.
There's the Opa Opa.
Really?
Yeah.
When you're... Because you can shoot different of those little, you know, pods and get power-ups and one of your power-ups is an OPA-OPA and it gives you a level up.
And it's just a little icon of an OPA-OPA.
Well, I think this is alternate audio.
I don't think that's actually the game.
Yeah, that one, if this one I'm thinking of, that is.
They said they unsynced and had to use different music.
Dope.
But yeah, um...
If you watch the anime too, there's little scenes where the Opa Opa is hanging out with them.
Some little references.
Fantasy Zone.
Awesome.
And of course we know what Fantasy Zone also had to do with.
Space Harrier.
Maybe we should have Seven Degrees of Space Harrier.
Could be a new game to play.
Yeah.
Alright, well there it is.
Your classic game of the week.
Zillion for the Sega Master System.
Go play it.
It's fun.
Alright.
We'll see what she picks next week because you still get one for the marathon show.
Then we might have to actually play it.
I think we should.
We'll see.
I'm going to dig into the closet and go obscure.
It better not suck.
That's all I'm saying.
All right.
We're going to take a quick break here at Orange Laundry.
Just for that, I'm going to make Rob play through Bungaio by himself on one man.
Why?
Why would you do that?
Alright, we're going to take a quick break here at Orange Lounge Radio, but don't go anywhere.
We will be right back with plenty more news stories.
We've got your Twitter topics coming too, so make sure you get those in on Twitter.
Your emails and phone calls all when we get back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.
We are taping live on this Sunday evening, August the 29th of 2010.
It is the 379th episode of our show and lots of folks in our chatroom talking about the upcoming marathon last week.
Some folks asking, Robert M is asking in chat, any chance of the marathon being on the podcast or would there be licensed music being used?
Right now I don't see why it wouldn't be podcast.
I mean I guess it depends on what happens and the legality of what happens.
But I don't see why not.
It will probably be labeled separately so that those folks, you know, because not everybody's going to want to hear it because it's going to have a different flow.
It's not going to be as, dare I say it, polished as this show is, which you know is going to be really bad.
But, you know, I'm going to label it differently, but it'll be there, I mean, for folks to download.
But those folks that aren't really interested in the excess will be able to just get the regular three-hour show and move on with it.
But yeah, that's what we're aiming for right now anyway We'll let you know for sure, of course, after we tape next week Anyhow, we've got more news to get into And of course we're going to get your Twitter topics here in just a minute And the FUs of the week, the mailbag, all those fun segments Phone calls coming up too But first, quick, quick, quick news There's just so much to talk about this week We just don't have time to spend 10 minutes on everything But Loki, what do we want to talk about quickly?
This is Vegas is apparently cancelled.
It was a game that was being developed by Surreal Software for Midway.
But of course when Midway closed down it was then bought up by Warner Brothers Interactive.
The premise of the game was retarded as it was.
It's basically you going to Vegas, dancing, driving fast cars, punching people, and gambling.
And apparently the game is rumored to have cost $43 million to make.
Wow, what a waste of money that was.
But no confirmation whether it's coming.
It's actually canceled or not, but who gives a crap?
What are you talking about?
That's what I do every time I go visit Tiara.
Exactly.
Why would you want to play a game that do that?
I just don't understand.
The Homebrew Channel, it's been something that's been kind of a staple of the homebrew community on the Wii.
for quite a while now since the release of homebrew channel version 1.07 they have added anonymous user statistics to the homebrew channel
And apparently they have detected about 200,000 people using the homebrew channel on the Wii So that's kind of cool And unsurprisingly I guess the top country using this would be the USA Followed by France, Germany, Spain, and the Great Britain Um
and it's interesting though that with that many systems out there there's not really a lot of people that use kind of the homebrew channel for stuff.
So maybe the hacking and piracy stuff on the Wii isn't as prevalent as they think it is.
Of course there's other methods for that but it's interesting nonetheless.
And then finally a unique...
MMO Dead State
And I guess that developer is composed of Bethesda and Troika vets.
They've come up with this new RPG set in a fictional town called Splendid, Texas.
and which is in the middle of the grips I guess in the grips of a full on zombie apocalypse and the object is the keep yourself alive and I guess you operate out of a local school which serves as a hub and sanctuary from the horrors of the community and from there you must head out into the wild hunting down supplies and other survivors and of course using those resources to beef up your base there
and of course there's tons of zombies and not everybody that you find will be friendly or sane for that matter and combat is supposed to be turn based and you'll be able to issue commands to whole groups or individuals as well so that's supposed to be headed out on a PC sometime I guess relatively soon
Taking a step backward here real quick in chat, but it's a good chat comment.
TigerClaw in our chat says, and those who pirate games, some people have been playing Metroid Other M on JustinTV, and I noticed one playing a pirated version that was loaded from the Homebrew channel.
I'm sure there are.
It's been leaked out since last week, so I wouldn't be surprised.
Yikes.
Alright, well, moving on to some other quick news here.
I'm talking about another game coming out from Sony.
It's up on PlayStation Japan.
There's apparently a teaser page, and on this page you see this Japanese guy sitting in a tuxedo, and it looks like he's knitting.
It looks like the Godfather.
It is what it looks like, but it's on PlayStation Japan, and EA owns the rights to Godfather, but the Godfather is knitting.
It's for LittleBigPlanet 2.
You think?
No, it's been confirmed that's what it's for.
Interesting.
Because he's crocheting a sack boy.
But it's just funny, because if you actually go to the page, there's an animation of him crocheting.
Cute.
Yes.
All right, I get it.
That's funny.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Also, the theme song to Zombies is now available on Rock Band Network.
Also, if that wasn't enough, you're soon going to be able to get Zombies shirts and Hot Topic.
Because you know Hot Topic loves to get in on that trendy stuff.
And I love this shirt here.
It just says, Zombies!
With a big exclamation, exclamation, one.
There you go.
Also, real quickly, some music game news updates.
Beatmania 2DX18 called Resort Anthem.
I know, right?
I'm like, wow, they got far.
It doesn't matter what it's called.
2DX Sports Resort.
It'll always be 18th style to me.
But Resort Anthem has a release date.
It's September 15th.
There you go.
And all those no arcades, it'll import that here in the U.S.
And then lastly, DDRX2 is going to be location tested very soon in Joy-Z.
I don't have the specifics on where.
I'm hoping somebody in our chatroom can fill me in.
Unfortunately, my little newsy link is... Oh, there we go.
On the border with lots of skee-ball.
It wasn't working a minute ago.
No, it actually is going to be at Funplex in East Hanover, New Jersey.
That's where it's at.
Enjoy if you live in Joy-Z or nearby.
Go play some X2 and let us know what you think.
Dark Sakura.
I got your news right here.
Well, there's a rumor going that for Marvel vs. Capcom 3 that Crimson Viper is going to be a character in it.
But I think it's looking at this outline and the way that they have it done on the site that I think it's actually very likely Crimson Viper.
They just masked her out and showed the silhouette and it fits perfectly.
And
So, um, I don't, she's cheap.
Why put her in the game?
Why do people hate her so much?
I was reading the comments on that site and there's a lot of hate for Crimson Viper.
She's a cheap whore?
Well, a lot of characters in Street Fighter are cheap whores.
That's what that game's all about.
She's a masher's paradise?
Sounds good to me.
She's Eddie Gordo.
I used to love Eddie Gordo in Tekken 3.
Mash her.
And what?
And what?
So what are you going to do when you have, you know, Tekken versus Street Fighter or whatever, and you can do Eddie Gordo versus Crimson Viper?
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.
What he said.
It's like, mash, mash, mash, mash, switch.
Mash, mash, mash, mash, switch.
All the buttons on my controller break within a week.
How'd this happen?
What'd you do that for?
Well, how about something for a different game?
I don't know when I started talking in LeetSpeak.
How does it happen?
Crackdown 2, Rob.
Crackdown 2.
A.K.A.
I don't know.
I like jumping the sequel.
Basically, the new download content is going to be...
It's called Toy Box.
And there's a free version that will have one called Keys to the City, which is an unlock, and the Thruster ability, which is jetpacks for your boot and vehicle tag.
And then if you pay the 560 Microsoft points, then you'll get 5 new weapons, 2 new vehicles, a couple avatar items, 10 new Chivos.
So, according to this, I guess that means achievement, huh?
I think that's a stupid word.
It makes me think of Cheetos and now I want some.
Why have Cheetos when you can have those knock-off Cheetos that are like the cheesy poofs?
Cheese puffs.
They sell them in big old bags at Trader Joe's.
They're still cheesy but they're more puffy.
They make me more puffy when I eat them.
How about something else?
How about it?
Oh, wait, wait.
I want to say real quick.
If Microsoft knew what they were doing, they would release download content for, I don't know, 400 points, 800 points that would allow you to go into the arena with the announcer and flamethrower him to death and then he'll talk and announce about how he's dying and why would you want to kill me?
I've got a wife and family, peacekeeper, or whatever, agent.
You can bite my butt, boss.
Anyway.
It's Robert Stack, okay?
They somehow have downloaded his consciousness into the game, and that's who I picture talking to me, and it makes me all warm and fuzzy inside.
Yeah, but you say Robert Stack, and I think Ultra Magnus.
Because Transformers the movie was awesome.
Not the new ones!
The old school, animated.
Anyway.
But we need sad music, Rob.
We need really sad music.
Okay, hold on.
Let me get you some sad music.
Or maybe like some Sanctus or something.
Can you fill time while I get you sad music?
Well, I know this is supposed to be like a little quick segment.
Hold on, hold on.
Here's your sad music.
Come on, work.
Okay, wait.
Oh wait, sorry, I got the B-52's Funplex.
I was thinking Funplex earlier, I know.
I got the song for the other story mixed up.
Oh well, make it work.
You can just play this.
We have to say rest in peace to a company who has brought us a bunch of games.
They brought us Space Jam.
They brought us Burnout.
by Acclaim.
Acclaim is going down.
I thought they'd been down for a while.
They're really down now.
It's just gone.
Rob, you are a sick puppy.
Sick puppy!
Sorry, Acclaim.
Well, yeah, basically the deal is that Howard Marks bought the name and tried to reboot it as a free-to-play games portal.
It was terrible.
Yeah, and crash and burn.
I think you can go to the site and get refunds.
Anyway.
What was the last big thing Acclaim did?
I haven't seen that name since, gosh.
Welcome to NBA Jam.
Didn't they do Double Dragon?
Okay, NBA Jam.
I was going to say Double Dragon 2 on the NES, I think was them.
Yeah.
Well, NBA Jam, though, the last system that was out was, and I think it was, other than download versions, they did one on the PlayStation.
Well, they did.
You're right.
Yeah, that we've been looking for that isn't the other version.
Thank you, Ranma.
Acclaim did BMX XXX.
That was Acclaim.
I think that was the first foot in the grave.
What a fine piece of gaming history that game is.
I guess it was Acclaim.
It was a fun game, okay?
It was fun.
Alright, let's move on, guys.
It was kind of cool dragging a hoe around on your bike.
As in a BMX bike.
Wow, let's get into some Twitter topics.
Twitter.com slash OLR
DJ Blaze Quinn is announcing this.
I read this earlier in the week and I think this is worth reading.
G4 has announced, according to DJ Blaze Quinn here in this news story, a new show called Bomb Patrol Afghanistan.
Have you heard about this?
This is the show on G4, which I don't know why we're reporting on this on the show.
I think we banned G4 news from the show a while ago, but oh well, moment of weakness.
They've made a show out of the Hurt Locker.
Yeah, the one that won the Oscar.
Yeah, apparently it is Bomb Patrol Afghanistan.
It's a new series about real-life soldiers who put their lives on the line every day as members of the Explosive Ordnance Disposal.
The show will follow the lives of the EOD team, both at home and in Afghanistan.
You know what?
All things considered, I don't think it sounds like a bad show.
It's just basically a documentary-ish type of show.
I mean, it's not like they're voting people out or...
You get voted out of Afghanistan!
Sweet!
I'm sorry, we're sending you home.
You know why this is news?
It's an interesting show on G4.
But I really don't understand the Hurt Locker connection.
I think I would watch it.
It made that subject...
Put that subject in the public eye, if you will.
And this is just furthering that.
So, I don't know.
I don't necessarily see it as bad news.
It's just not gaming, but how long has G4 not been gaming for?
I'll tell you, a really long time.
By the way, also, in somewhat related-ish news, EA is standing by their... Again, this is from a tweet from DJ Blaziken.
Each EA is standing by Medal of Honor's choice to include the Taliban.
Let's see, a comment here from British Defense Secretary Liam Fox, who criticized the game.
Quote, "...at the hands of the Taliban, children have lost fathers and wives have lost husbands.
It's shocking that someone would think it is acceptable to recreate the acts of the Taliban and British soldiers.
It's hard to believe any citizen of our country would wish to buy such a thoroughly un-British game.
I would urge retailers to show their support for our armed forces and ban this tasteless product."
Ooh, EA standing by it saying, it is a creative risk, but they are not going to let the protesters, quote, compromise our creative vision and what we want to do.
If you don't like it, don't buy it.
Sounds good to me.
Going back to the tweets.
DarkKisuke says, talk about Reach.
I don't know, Halo 3 just kind of, it wasn't as, plus the group I used to play with, a bunch of college buddies, like a bunch of them had babies and stuff and they don't want to play video games online anymore.
So there you go.
I don't really... I kind of lost interest in the Halo series.
I'll check it out.
If somebody I know buys it, I'll look.
Is Dan getting Halo Reach?
You guys probably aren't getting it, huh?
That depends.
Yeah, he'll probably get Halo Reach.
I'm sure it's a popular game.
We'll see.
TigerClaw305 sends us some links.
Real quickly, a Wii balance board used to create a motorized baby buggy.
That's awesome.
How does that work?
It's basically, it's a toddler that can't really, or not even toddler, an infant that can't walk yet.
Who makes the Skynet?
It's a college student.
Oh, of course.
But it's awfully cute.
Alright.
Also, another link from Tigerclaw.
Lenovo developing a motion control console for China.
Hmm.
I guess it's called the E-Box?
The console will also focus less on violence and more on family entertainment.
Well, as does the Kinect.
Oops.
I swear I didn't plan that song to come on, but it's kind of funny in retrospect.
More tweets.
Maybe this will be the last one here.
Oh, no, there's a couple here.
DarkKeysK gets another one in here.
Maxis Dark Spore, a Diablo-style action RPG.
I don't know much about Dark Spore.
Is this a game you know a little more about?
It's a combination.
It's basically like Spore, but set in a Diablo-type gameplay.
So you create your character, and it's a hack-and-slash game.
Oh, that sounds kind of cool.
Maxis is the folks that made Spore, after all.
They also made The Sims.
They've been around a while, because that's basically Will Wright's studio, isn't it?
Actdeft is linking us to a story Xplay gave Metroid Other M a 2 out of 5 says no need to watch the video
Um, that's some intern at the station trying to keep X-Play relevant by causing a little controversy, I'm sure.
No, I don't know.
Maybe the game is terrible.
I don't know.
It didn't get terrible reviews.
I think it looks pretty good.
I think what people didn't like was how sometimes it would switch between the first person and third person view.
Just if you happen to, like, move the controller off the screen, it would just all of a sudden switch back, and that kind of sucked.
and also the fact that you couldn't basically run around in the first person mode so people had gripes about that.
Probably because they've been playing Metroid Prime for a while but whatever, it looks kind of cool.
I'll just go on record and say fuck X-Play.
Lastly, Sterlok.
Pokemon Black and White are the fastest selling DS games in history.
Well, there's a big surprise.
Links us to this article.
That does confirm, ever since July 31st, 2010, over a million pre-orders for Pokemon Black and White version were taken.
That's 1.08 pre-orders for this game launching September 18th, 2010.
And so Nintendo is saying that it's going to make Pokemon Black and White the fastest selling DS games ever.
See, that's cheating though, because there's two different games there.
But they counted as one.
That's fuzzy math.
Whatever, I guess everybody lets him get away with it because it's Pokemans.
TigerClaw wants to point out that Metroid Other M has an 81 on Metacritic.
So that 2 out of 5 seems to be a little bit out of place.
Anyhow.
Let's move on to some other gaming news.
If you want to send us some tweets for next week, twitter.com slash olr.
and, of course, as not a big surprise, Microsoft saying, oh, we're going to ban everybody that's playing Reach.
Well, first off, if you're dumb enough to play online with Reach, then yes, you should be banned anyways.
I'm assuming that this is also considering people that...
Aren't necessarily playing online, but say people that have a JTAG console or something, and have an account that they use for live, and maybe move their account back and forth on a memory unit or something like that, and it would show in your recently played games or something like that, or if you get achievements before the release date, and then they can check out whether you have a modded console or something like that.
So, if you don't want to get banned...
Just don't play with a profile that you use online until it's launched.
And they claim, though, that they can tell the difference between this and with the full version.
But, you know, if you're really that scared about it, you can always re-download it when it gets leaked out from the disc.
So, I don't know.
But, yeah, so they're threatening to ban people, as they probably would.
This doesn't come as a big surprise, though.
No, not at all.
I mean, they always want to ban people who are playing the game.
Of course, they don't want to say, well...
Oh darn, I guess there's nothing we can do about it.
Steal away.
I mean, they're not going to say that.
They're going to be like, we're going to come to your house and set you on fire.
I mean, that's the kind of threats that they should be making.
We will destroy you.
If we could make your Xbox do other ring colors, we would.
Your console will get set on fire and burn down your house and kill your cat.
That's right.
I don't know, Shermie's very well insulated.
That would be funny, though.
They have robot legs built into it.
It just gets up, walks out, and goes back to Microsoft.
Now that's a show I want to see on G4.
Cat vs. Xbox.
We've had that in my house.
Have you?
You know what it was?
What?
Jamie taking the vacuum to the Xbox to get the cat hair out of it.
Nice.
Cat wins.
Maybe the cat was laying on top of it because it's warm.
You know that happens quite a bit.
Shermie... It would be too much effort for Shermie to get on top of it.
I'll put it that way.
My cat loves my Xbox 360, especially in the winter.
She'll lay behind it.
but she'll lay so close to it that there's no air flow so I don't really appreciate that too much but she will lay next to it.
That and the computer.
She loves all the hot air being blown out.
They're warm.
Exactly.
Or she'll lay on power supplies you know like those big old transformers because they're super hot.
She's just like laying her head right on them like Katie you're going to electrocute yourself or something.
You know what your cat needs is like an electric blanket or some other source.
No she doesn't.
You know what I got for Shermie is this mat that redistributes their own heat and warms the whole thing.
and she loves it and it was like 10 bucks.
She has her little baby bed that she lays in still even though she's like way bigger than it but you know she's spoiled and she doesn't need anything.
Kitten mittens.
Does your cat make too much noise?
Mittens made out of kittens?
Well we got plenty of kittens to do that.
Alright.
Speaking of which, does anyone want a kitten?
I mean because I've got like tons of them.
They're overrunning my backyard.
What are you going to do if somebody in New York is like, yes, I want a cat?
I will put it in a box and ship it UPS.
No, no, just kidding.
I will not do that because that's cruel.
We'll ship it FedEx.
Obviously, I can't get you a cat unless you actually drive all the way out here.
Heart8 in our chatroom suggests a cat Snuggie.
I like that idea.
But, unfortunately, you will have to come and... It's kind of like pick and pull.
You will have to pick and pull your own cat out of the backyard.
I can't provide that service for you.
There's only one cat that will actually... There's one of the cats that will actually get very paralyzed with fear.
And that's the only cat that I can actually pick up out there.
Because it'll just kind of freeze up and I just...
Scoop.
Scoop it right up.
Alan showed me a video this week that makes me want a dog.
Like, seriously.
Because this is the cutest dog I've ever seen in my life.
Okay?
And you know what type of dog it is?
It's a corgi.
I love corgis!
And the video, if you want to look this up on YouTube, is called Corgi Flop.
And it's the most adorable thing I've ever seen in my entire life.
So, like, there's this little dog that goes in.
And then they got... Oh, wait, wait, wait.
Oh, where's the corgi?
Corgi!
Okay, so the dog and the person jump in.
There goes the corgi.
Corgi.
Hold on.
The corgi, like, watches for a minute, and then the corgi just, at some point, the corgi goes, come on, come on, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it.
Thanks for watching!
Let me link that in our chat room there, because I apologize.
That makes for terrible radio, but I had to derail the show and just tell you about my experience.
That's a big deal.
For me to say I want a dog is a huge deal.
Ask somebody who's known me for years and years.
DarkSakura, me saying I want a dog, that's like call hell and ask if they've got ice cream.
Really, yeah.
It's like going into Rob's bedroom and finding an AK under his bed.
Pretty much.
All right, anyhow, let's move on.
8-Hour-a-Week Limit
Yes, that's right.
What's happening is that apparently in Final Fantasy XIV, once you've played a particular job class for 8 hours, the amount of experience you start to earn decreases.
And once you've played for 15 hours, you're done.
You can't earn any more experience.
This is the reverse of what other games like World of Warcraft do.
Wait, is it just one job class?
Can you switch classes to something else?
Yes, apparently you can.
But that's like, you know, if you remember Final Fantasy XI, that's practically like doing a whole different character.
Completely different.
Here's a quote real quick about why this system is in place.
Quote,
Furthermore, it is being designed to not give those with more time on their hands to play an unfair advantage.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Just up in arms about this.
Like, on the website going crazy.
Like, you guys have got to be kidding me.
Who are you to tell me how long I can be playing these games?
It's my money.
There's another thing, though, to consider is that if it's also on a per-character basis, it also sort of balances out the leveling.
I mean, what's the word I'm thinking of?
The hierarchy of levels?
Yeah.
to where you're not going to have a week later maxed out characters.
You're going to have people to really follow the incentive that are going to be on a more even par so people move up together and then they can start putting out content later on for those people who hit those higher levels.
Does that make sense?
A little bit.
Now, there was a translation that came out on the North American website that helped her try to bring some clarity to this.
It's very lengthy.
Let me try to give you the bullet points here.
We calculated a value for the amount of skill or experience points that could be earned in a one-hour period.
This theoretical value represents an hour spent engaged solely in combat, left quests, or any other activities that earn skill or experience points and sets a threshold to delimiting how many of these points can be earned in a period of play.
based on this we have implemented a threshold value concept these thresholds are regulated by a one week timer that begins counting down the instant you earn experience points after a week has passed the thresholds will reset and the moment skill experience points are earned again the timer begins counting down anew for the first eight thresholds during this week long period players will receive skill or experience points at the maximum rate and then it goes on after that and then eventually reaches a rate of zero
It is worth noting, however, that the reduced rate will also gradually recover while players are engaged in activities that do not yield skill or experience points.
In this manner, it is possible for the threshold value to reset completely even before the completion of the one-week timer.
So in a nutshell, this is very convoluted, but those of you that just plan to take three days off work and play Final Fantasy XIV non-stop when this comes out are going to be hitting this wall.
yeah but now they're talking about stuff that doesn't require skills so say for example I go and fight fight fight fight fight and then burn out the whole thing then I can go craft and that will kind of build it back I mean I could spend a bunch of time like making food or something I don't know
It's interesting.
I mean, it's their game.
They can do what they want, but let me go back.
I've played the Final Fantasy XIV beta.
It stinks, and I'm sorry.
I don't think they made a quick game at all.
It's harder, at least in the beta I played.
Again, it's been a couple months, or maybe a month.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
for me, that's where the weirdness is of this is that they swear up and down they want to make this more casual MMO and something you don't have to spend all this time playing but it just seems like the game itself is still Final Fantasy XI upgraded you know what I mean?
so, I don't know
That'd be weird.
Bonds in our chatroom says, good thing Warcraft does not do that.
Well, if you think about it, though, they do, in a way.
They just do the reverse.
You get rewarded with double XP for the time you aren't playing and logged out consecutively on a character.
And that's to help you catch up so that people can't get too far ahead.
So it's just like, it's more of a reward than a penalty.
And I think that seems to be where a lot of people are up in arms.
So...
Ziba in our chatroom says Guild Wars 2 all the way.
You know, I saw a video of Guild Wars 2 gameplay and I gotta say it looks pretty hot.
It looks very action oriented.
Let me see if I can find that same video here.
Another quick YouTube.
Have either of you guys heard anything about Guild Wars 2 or seen any of this?
Nope.
I kind of got out of the Guild Wars thing.
This is so different.
Oh, here it is.
I think this is out of Gamescom.
Yeah, there we go.
DarkSakura
Well, in other stuff, we do have... Now, this is not just gaming related.
This is archaeology and anthropology and prehistoric biology.
So, like Indiana Jones?
Laura Croft, Tomb Raider
They found a type of turtle, a Maolinid, I believe is how it's said, that evolved 50 million years ago.
But now the funny thing about it is that when you look at it face on, it looks like King Koopa.
Seriously, it's got the same facial shape.
And I'm not saying the old school Koopa, I'm saying the modern incarnation.
It's got that flat head and the horns.
What are you talking about?
That thing looks nothing like Dennis Hopper.
Get it?
Yes, I get it.
I know it's too soon, but they're both dead!
Wah wah.
I'm going to actually link the story into the chatroom because this is actually pretty cool.
I'd like to see what our chatroom thinks about this.
A quick wire in.
You know what it looks like?
It looks like, oh God, what the hell is his name?
It looks fat is what it looks like.
The big old turtle from Final Fantasy?
Oh, I know what you're talking about.
Yes, yes.
I know exactly what you're talking about.
I forget the name too.
Now, here's the question that's burning on my mind, DarkSakura.
Was it a Koopa Troopa or a Para Koopa Troopa?
It's a King Koopa.
Oh, I see.
Seriously, look at that head.
That's an ugly sumbitch.
Well, maybe it's... And Ranma in chat says, Zach, it's my ex-girlfriend.
You dated a turtle?
God, you're dumb.
I like following all the links on here.
What kind of weird kinky shit are you into?
Is it possible that Miyamoto just got inspiration from books on the Galapagos Islands or something?
It could be.
I think we're reading way too much into this.
Yeah, I think you're right.
I mean, after all, it's the turtle that decided to evolve into something that would become a video game.
That's why.
You know, we are thinking way too hard on this, and Loki, I demand a story about porn.
Help me out here.
A story about porn.
Well, you know what?
I think I can kind of help you out because Playboy is teaming up with Big Point to form a new game label because they had some really awesome games that came out way back in the day, I guess.
Now this isn't about porn because you know you only subscribe to Playboy for the articles.
Um, anyways, they're teaming up with Big Point, uh, which is currently working on, I guess, the Battlestar Galactica online game, not having to do with porn, and, uh, other free, uh, to play games on its own web portal.
And it says, uh, Playboy will now also distribute, uh, through its own domain some, uh, free-to-play games.
Uh, the first game to get the Red Cartman treatment is Poisonville.
I wonder if this is like Farmville, but with poison.
Link is probably not safe for work.
Let's check it out.
And the video's not playing, so I can only assume that there's no boobs.
And I am very disappointed by that.
Although I do have to say, though, in the background they have Pam Anderson from Miss February 1990.
And she looks quite different now.
DarkSakura.com
Oh, she's making out with some dude.
Oh, and she stole his car.
Now that sounds like a game, Jamie.
It's like they do a GTA game starring a badass chick.
Well, that's what it seems like so far.
Yeah, I'll play that.
And she's going into the ghetto.
There's all sorts of guys.
There's a guy that just did a roundhouse kick into a windshield and broke the windshield.
That's really excessive.
and now she's teaming up with some really weird looking bikers it's a bunch of like really kind of girl powered chicks with assault rifles so if you imagine like a Saints Row why is Playboy making this girl Saints Row or APB with like you know lots of chicks and ski masks look look I don't mean to sound like sexist or whatever but why is Playboy
The home of women exploitation.
Making this game that's now like, hey, the girl's in charge.
I'm Angelina Jolie.
I'm making out and stealing cars and all this stuff.
Like, I don't get it.
It looks neat.
I mean, if it's free to play, I might check it out because, you know, it's kind of cool looking.
But that's the trailer, which I'm sure has nothing to do with the actual gameplay of the game.
And I gotta say, with a game that's, you know, on Playboy.com, um...
Poisonville.com
Let's see, Toa Gak in our chatroom says, GTA, girl take all your shit, in parentheses.
Nah, he's trying, he's trying.
You need a better acronym than that.
Oh, they've got the beta.
You can try this free to play right now.
Someone sounds like an infomercial.
Are you on Playboy's payroll?
No, I'm on...
I'm on the Poisonville website.
But I gotta say, though, I'm looking at all these different screenshots.
The screenshots look pretty good, but the game has no nudity.
Therefore, it does not need to be on this website.
Now, if it's Playboy Mansion, the game, you know, where it's like, you know, kind of an adult version of Charlie's Angels where Hef is Charlie.
The girls next door of the game would be great.
Hello, angels.
I need you to pleasure me today.
That's how I kind of picture that game.
I just want a decent game with boobies.
Is that too much to ask?
Besides God of War.
All right.
Moving on.
Let's talk about...
Atari 2600 Sword Quest, Tempest,
Outlaw, Dodgem, Real Sports Football, Starship, and basically all the same shit you see in Game Room, right?
And then there's some arcade hits, including Pong and Lunar Lander and Missile Command and all this.
I guess the one neat thing about this game, it is a $30 cartridge, so you're kind of like, oh boy, what do I care?
The one neat thing about this game is that it does have something Game Room doesn't have.
Single cartridge multiplayer games.
Thank you for watching!
I don't know.
We got our retro fix with Game Room, and if they would just add multiplayer, maybe it would be better, and so on and so forth.
There you go.
Hey, how about the mailbag?
Let's go to our mailbag at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com Every week, DarkSakura dives into the mailbag head first, picks out a couple emails that she thinks are worthy of being read on the show, and then she reads them.
I do.
You do.
So, DarkSakura.
Well, first of all, I delete any email that's full of stupidity.
Good for you!
So let me go on to the first of our beautiful, gorgeous, fantastical emails.
I'll start with a shorty.
Greetings, OLR crew.
It's been a while, hasn't it?
Just want to say that I love the show.
Also, I saw Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, and it's now my new favorite movie.
The video game references are hilarious.
The Gay Roommate is hilarious, and so are the seven evil exes.
I'm going to buy the book so I can see the backstory, and I'm going to buy the game also.
So keep up the good work, OLR.
Love, Geekboy2424.
P.S.
Those of you who get the reference from K-On, I give OLR a moi moi heart cannon.
Wow.
Well, thanks.
I'm glad you liked the movie.
I didn't think it was the best movie ever, but it tickled the retro funny bone, I suppose.
You know, all that stuff.
There you go.
Next one from Troy.
Hi.
Okay, apparently he sent two, so I'm going to actually go to the, see if I can find the first one.
Okay, maybe not.
I'll just go ahead and read this one.
Sorry for the double email, but I thought this was funny.
Apparently you can buy Halo Reach early for 99,999 Microsoft points.
Oh, somebody didn't listen to last week's show yet when they sent the email.
Yeah.
Talked all about it on last week's show.
And no, you can't.
It's much cheaper than that now.
Is it?
Yeah, free.
True, true.
But you might get banned according to an article earlier in the show.
This one's for me.
Hey OLR, I'm writing in with a food-related question.
It's labeled Orange Lounge Foodio.
Food-related question specifically for Jamie.
Apologies for sending this to the show inbox, but I couldn't find a way of contacting her personally.
Wow.
Well, I'll go ahead and read it.
We haven't had a good food derailing yet.
DarkSakura.com
I've been including foods such as salmon, beef, and oats into my diet.
Anything with healthy fats and proteins will be appreciated as well.
Thank you so much in advance.
I love the show and keep up the good work.
I'm not going to read the person's name, but I'm sure the person knows who it is.
Well, you're going to want to eat fried chicken and pizza.
No, Rob.
It's gaining... That's how I gain weight.
The way that my uncle did it is he ate a lot of tuna.
A lot of tuna.
You can also...
Keep in mind, I'm going more towards the opposite direction, towards the lean tissue, the losing side.
But you can eat... Tempeh is really good to get your protein from if you want a vegetarian source.
Tofu... Beefcake 3000.
Beefcake!
If you're trying to go the real food route, I know that the way that my uncle did it is that also instead of sucrose, he used fructose as his sweetener because it's a more complex sugar.
More whole wheat type stuff, but I'd say lots of fish.
Lots of fish.
Go get sushi.
A lot of sashimi.
and you know, I don't know if you've got a Fuddruckers where you are.
I haven't seen them out in that area but maybe they do.
They have elk burgers and they're super good.
You can get elk and game meat like you can get venison at some grocery stores.
You can probably go hunting for it.
I should put out this disclaimer.
Jamie's not a doctor and neither am I. I am not.
And you really should, if you want to make sure you're doing it the right way, be under a doctor's care.
That's what I was going to say, Rob.
I'm just saying.
I was going to say it.
I just don't want to get sued.
I'm not a doctor.
I'm telling you what I've read.
She plays one on the internet.
Dr. Sakura.
No.
She's played a lot of Trauma Center.
Shut up.
Don't make me break out the Vuvuzela.
Anyway, I'm really, I'm just passing on to you what I've observed, what I've seen other people do.
Really the best thing to do, which is what I was getting to before Rob stood on the soapbox, is talk to your nutritionist.
Find a nutritionist.
Do some research.
I'll email you back with some of my own happenings.
I'll make sure that you get my contact information.
But...
but yeah, I mean, and of course make sure that you do not slack off on the exercise change your routine
Unless your goal is to get a bigger butt.
A trainer that I talked to just the other day actually said that if you start hitting a rut in your, like your, and I was kind of actually, I was thinking about this too because I used to do this with DDR.
Okay.
Is that if you feel something getting too easy and you know, you can change it up, do something that's harder because that's how you challenge yourself, right?
Right.
Well, someone was bringing it up at the gym just the other day and I was hearing him talk about it and I guess the same thing would apply, you know.
I'm not a fitness coach.
And if all you really want is a bigger butt, DarkSakura was looking at some stuff before the show.
Booty pop panties.
Just look them up.
Booty pop panties.
They're $20 panties.
They give you a bigger butt.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Second, about the marathon show, I'd be up for it.
I haven't been able to listen live for a while because of school and working on my book.
But the concept of a marathon show intrigues me.
Just think of all the loopy, incoherent chatter we could deliver around 8 a.m.
It'll be like the old school DDR tournament shows.
If you want to hear some real train wreck radio...
Go look at like the go try to find the show.
I don't even know if it was recorded at B3 where we did like we had to do like 20 hours of programming across two days.
It was crazy.
And it's or my favorite as well was the shaft that we did.
Yes, it was called Sacramento hosts another fabulous tournament.
Oh, that's what we said it was.
Yes.
Uh, that's, that was hosted at Scandia, and I just remember, like, I was emceeing the, the DDR freestyle, and at certain points, I'd look over, and there was one point where it just looked like Loki was bambling, rambling incoherently into the microphone, like, I don't even know what he was saying, and then at one point, Jahi, God, I love that guy, I don't know where he, where he's at these days, but Jahi, like, I remember looking over, and he had the mic just by himself, and he was just doing, like, this, right?
Like yelling into the microphone, it seemed like I'm like, who's listening to him right now?
Poor people.
I love Jahi.
Oh yeah, good times.
By the way, just a note for anyone who owns an iPad, buy a Bluetooth wireless keyboard.
It is a better keyboard than the virtual keyboard on the iPad, doesn't move out of place like the keyboard that hooks into the iPad dock, and can be found online for 40 bucks.
Again, I own an iPad.
That's the face he made, the P. So it...
Staycare Redertainment.
This message has been brought to you by the Black Robin Christmas Carol.
Insert self-indulgent plug here.
Sent from my iPad.
Ha!
Last email, Rob?
No, actually we got two.
Oh, here's the other part from Troy.
Sorry.
Hey there, OLR.
I don't entirely know if you guys know how to love a cat or even if you have a pet, but you should watch this.
Oh, it's 100 Ways to Love a Cat.
I'll watch it later.
I'll watch it later.
I have a cat.
I have a Shermie.
She likes to be loved with food.
Okay, here's the last one.
Hi, OLR folks.
Hi.
Rob.
What?
I'm going to respond back.
If they say hi, I've got to say hi back.
I don't want to be rude.
Hi, OLR folks.
There was something that a friend of mine said to me that really bothered me.
He said I wasn't a hardcore gamer.
I was quite hurt by that because I always thought I was a hardcore gamer.
I have a PS3, Wii, DS, First Generation, Dreamcast, Game Boy Color, and N64.
I still win.
All with their original boxes.
I've got figurines from Soul Calibur 2, a resin statue from Space Channel 5, mounds and mounds of video games, sheet music, a few video game reference t-shirts, and even my screensaver and desktop wallpapers are from Echo Chrome and I don't even owe the game.
Do you think I'm still a hardcore gamer?
Um...
Game is what you play, not what you own
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
my friend is constantly trying to get me to play Left 4 Dead and even though I don't have an Xbox 360 nor do I want one the reason I don't want to play it is because I suck at first person shooters and I end up getting killed when I try to fight against more seasoned gamers except for Portal see, your friend's a hater I can't wait for the sequel to come out for the record, sequel is spelled S-E-Q-U-E-L not A-L
For the past few years, FPSers have been all the rage.
There have been Halo clones left and right.
So I guess my question is, does not liking a certain genre that seems to currently be the most popular make you someone less of a gamer?
Thank you for reading my email, Stan.
No, it doesn't.
Your friend is just being a dick.
Okay, can I play devil's advocate for a minute?
I think everybody in chat is in agreeance that his friend's just being a jerk and a hater, and I think we're all saying that too, but let me ask you this.
Using this same logic, is somebody that plays Facebook games and Farmville and Bejeweled Blitz and Imagine Cat Shop and Just Dance, are they a gamer?
I don't think Facebook games count.
Really?
Really?
Now, if you're playing Bejeweled on a handheld system, that's a game.
See, okay, well, here's the definition.
You've got your casual games, right?
Which, they're technically, yes, they're games.
But I think that the actual definition of gamer as far as what is socially considered a gamer has to do specifically with PC and console games.
Not
Flash-based games, if you know what I mean.
But, like, installing said game on hard drive, playing, you know, against people.
The more... The higher intensity stuff.
I think multiplayer games, you know, again, installed content, console-type things, yes, those count.
That's a gamer.
But...
if you play mostly puzzlers and things you're going to be looped into that casual category and I think that hardcore if I'm going to even go a bit further into generalizations we're looking at a very um what's the word that I'm thinking of um
Gender-related type of theme.
I want to try and nail down this definition a lot quicker.
I think a gamer is someone who has an appreciation for game culture.
It's a gaming enthusiast.
If you went to the trouble to download this podcast and email it, you care about games enough.
I think you're a gamer.
If you have ever bought a gaming magazine off the shelf,
You have an interest in gaming culture.
We do have non-gamers that listen, by the way.
And that's possible, sure.
We probably have a lot of food fans at the rate this show is going.
If you are somebody who has ever watched a television program about video games because you are interested in the content...
You're probably a gamer.
I think a gamer is just somebody who has an active interest in gaming culture.
And somebody who does Farmville and that's it probably really isn't a gamer because they don't have an interest in the culture of games and why we play them and what motivates us and what keeps our interest.
You know what I mean?
Well, it's like, you know, the other definition of gamer is, of course, tabletop.
But, you know, it's like, I can sit down, when I play Monopoly, am I playing a game?
I'm playing as much of a game as I am playing Street Fighter.
It's a game, it's for entertainment.
But I don't collect Monopoly memorabilia.
So, I'm not a board gamer, I guess.
That's why I'm trying to look at it is by, and to put it back to this way, it's not what you have, it's what you do with it.
Okay, that sounded dirty.
um it's the games that you have the games that you enjoy and if you play them all the time that's pretty hardcore you know and if you make it a part of your life I think that may like you were saying if you make it a part of your life then you're a gamer and your friend's a hater and your friend's a hater your friend's just judging you all right
And TigerClaw in our chatroom says this If this so-called friend had been saying that, all that Then that is not a friend at all You get the impression that they don't want to be around you Just because you like games that they don't
I don't know if it's necessarily that severe, but your friend just kind of, in regards to this topic, needs to pull his head out of his butt.
Tiara told me something funny.
What's that?
If you're playing Monopoly, you may not be a board gamer, you might be a board gamer.
Ah, play on words.
She's a grammar enthusiast.
Alright.
Anyhow.
I don't know, I get pretty bored once, you know, all the big streets are bought up.
Is that it for the mailbag?
It's over!
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com The mailbag is closed.
It's time for us to do a little bit of ranting in a segment we like to call the F-Years of the Week.
I have a number of FUs, but one of them is... What was it I was ranting about when you guys came in today?
I don't remember.
I don't remember.
I don't remember.
Just... When I came in here, you were talking about those booty shorts.
Well, okay.
I've got a lot of really good stuff happening to me this week, so I'd say FU to not having enough time.
And stupid drivers!
I also feel a lack of time, especially since I have to take care of the baby and I don't sleep very much anymore.
I go to bed at like 11 and I have to wake up again to feed him.
Like last night, I actually was trying to go to bed at like 9 because I anticipate getting up way early in the morning.
And so I tried to put him down at 10 and he just kept fussing and would not go to sleep until about midnight.
A couple hours and then wake up usually with him around 4 o'clock in the morning or 5 o'clock in the morning, sometimes 6 o'clock in the morning and we're up until I have to go to work.
So, you know, multiply that times infinite and it really sucks.
But just the lack of time to actually get to work on my Grand Theft Auto mods and stuff like that.
and also an FU to just plain shitty drivers.
I was behind this old... Well, I thought it was an old man.
It ended up being an old woman.
But she was obviously lost and didn't know where she was going or she was looking for a turn of some sort.
And so she was driving really slow and then finally, it was funny and kind of ironic, blew through a red light and then it got caught by the red light camera.
So...
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
My god, you treat this shit like it's high school with all the fucking drama and stuff.
Some people are asking questions and you're like, well, I'm too good to answer your fucking questions.
So, you know, fuck them.
And fuck you for deleting my post just because I'm explaining how to do things because you want to claim to be the first person that's ever done this thing.
Maybe you should stop hanging on web forums with 14 and 15 year old boys.
Well, I try not to, but it's very limited.
Modding the Xbox 360 version of Grand Theft Auto, it's very limited in the amount of message boards out there for that.
Trust me, if there was a different source, a more mature form that I could go to, I would love to be there.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
You know, we ended up getting rerouted to another flight that was delayed for like three hours and it's kind of like they could have given us a better heads up about the delay.
I was a little irritated.
Some parts of that situation just seemed preventable.
I'm a pretty resilient person and I like to think I was able to let that situation kind of roll off my back as kind of like one of those funny life experiences.
But I did feel really bad for my friend who was supposed to be a birthday trip for her and it's just, you know, really bummed out about it and
I can understand.
Kind of sucks to have that happen.
So, just F you to shit happening.
Because sometimes it does.
Shit happens.
There ain't anything you can do about it.
Alright, meanwhile, back to the show.
Couple news stories for you guys, and then the Skype line!
Yes, it's kind of interesting.
There is a whole trademark dispute over Mafia Wars.
Digital Chocolate is claiming that they had the trademark Mafia Wars for their, I believe, is an iPhone game.
And then, of course, Zynga has their Mafia Wars game that came out later on that was on Facebook and PC and whatnot.
And, of course, now their Mafia Wars game has all sorts of different marketing with Seven
and that kind of stuff.
It says the United States Patent and Trademark Office lists Zynga's first filing date for the game under the name Mafia Wars as July 1st 2009 although no filing under that name could be located with Digital Chocolate as the applicant.
Digital Chocolate has not responded of course to the request by Joystick in this case.
Of course you know it's
Settlement Settlement
Anyhow, one more story for you guys.
I guess I should get that Skype line ready to go, shouldn't I?
All right.
1-877-GAME-OLR.
Username is Skype.
If you want to start calling.
But meanwhile, I got one more story for you guys.
And this is very interesting.
And it's one of those things I looked at and I was like, really?
Is this real life?
I don't even know.
What is this?
I cannot even.
It's a game called The Bible Online.
That's right.
This is real.
It's a game called The Bible Online where you will get to slip into the role of Abraham and his descendants and have the opportunity to reenact and witness the incidents of their times.
The game will be split into chapters.
The heroes will be the first one that comes out.
It's basically an MMO strategy game.
You control your own tribe.
You build a city.
You wage war in the name of God.
I see why I mean like this almost sounds like a joke like I just don't even get it but apparently there's a website it's thebible-onlinegame.com complete with side quests, role playing elements and there you go that's what it's all about no word yet if there's gonna be you know other religious texts what?
have you actually looked at the screen captures on it?
I did it's super dinky
I almost think it's not real.
No, it is.
It's real.
There's a beta sign up.
It's stinky.
It reminds me of a late 90s strategy game.
Where's Bibleville?
Are they going to have the Koran online?
Are they going to be equal opportunity and do a Koran online?
No.
Just don't put it too close to ground zero.
Anyhow.
Moving on.
Are you making food?
Are you making me food?
I don't want food.
Do you want a taco?
I don't want a taco.
I'm fine.
I've been sitting here hungry.
Then make a taco.
Watching Loki.
I'll eat.
Fine.
I'll take calls without you.
I'll be in here back in a second.
I'm also making my taco.
Do you want me to make you a taco?
No, I don't want a taco.
Then fine.
I'll be right back.
Fine.
Taco!
Do you want to send Dan in?
Maybe Dan wants to talk to some listeners.
Dan, you want to talk to some listeners?
Let's just have Dan answer the phones tonight.
Dan, come answer the phones!
He's busy playing something.
What's he playing?
Do you know?
I don't know.
Oh, he's coming.
What are you playing?
Hey, Dan.
Dan, you want to answer the phones tonight?
Yes.
Alright, Skyplane with Dan!
Alright, so you're just going to say, Hi, this is Orange Haunts Radio.
This is Dan.
What do you want?
Hey, this is DJ Blaziken This is who?
DJ Blaziken
DJ Blaziken.
Oh, good.
Good to hear from you.
What's up, man?
How you doing?
What can we do for you?
Not much other than I just got done with a Silent Hill in the dark session.
Wow.
Creepy as hell.
Now the question is, did you have surround sound?
I'm playing Homecoming for the 360, and I actually unplugged the 360 audio cables
I plugged in my PSP audio cable for the stream.
And so basically I'm listening to you guys while playing Silent Hill.
Kind of getting rid of some of the creepiness, but monsters coming out of the woodwork out of nowhere.
Makes you jump out of a chair.
See, that's a giant mistake, because Silent Hill is well known for its incredible sound design.
You play that on surround sound system in the dark, it's going to fuck you up for life.
Oh, trust me, I've been screwed for life by Silent Hill years ago.
Yeah, I trust you, but I don't really want to hear about it.
No, no, no, it was back on the old PlayStation 1.
I played it probably, I played a demo.
Hey, I'm in the middle of a call.
The demo of Silent Hill 1 basically creeped me the heck out when I was like 10, okay?
Okay.
You know, you probably shouldn't have been playing that when you were 10.
It must mean your parents don't care about you.
I gotta go.
I've been kicked out of the room.
Alright.
It's good to hear from you.
Give me that!
Stay black.
Thanks for the call.
Take care.
Bye.
What the hell?
I don't know.
Bye.
That's my husband.
I have to live with this.
Did he really just end that call with stay black?
I don't even... Did it occur to you that he's not black, Dan?
Alright, moving on.
Let's take another call.
I guess Dan left the room.
Let's move on.
You're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
This is Ranma.
I want to know, did you do that on purpose or what?
I mean, really, that was just excellent timing.
Do what on purpose?
Rob, you know exactly what I'm talking about.
The whole chat room knows.
Oh, no, but I would have closed the phone call with that if you want.
Actually, Dan just yelled from the living room, Ranma, stay black.
Tell them to stay white.
Ranma says to stay white.
I didn't think that was something that could be changed very easily unless you're like Ted Danson.
I think it has to do with those old 70s movies.
Just keep in mind, in the Hebrew Hammer, there's a line, Shlomo, stay Jewish.
Once in a while, it's a video game talk show.
I don't know if you've played any games this week, Ranma, but...
I have.
I have been playing Scott Pilgrim vs. the World for the last four to five days.
You know, I played the demo actually this week.
I didn't talk about it because I got consumed with the Lara Croft game, but what do you think?
Anyone that loves River City Ransom, get your ass on Xbox Live or PlayStation Network and get this game.
That's it.
It's just River City Ransom 2, isn't it?
It really is.
With all the gaming references, my god.
I mean, I'm a type of person where I will play through a game and I'm pretty much done with it.
I won't pick it up again.
First day, me and my roommate, we finished the game in four and a half hours.
A couple of days later, I jump on the game and plow right through it.
And I played through the game again last night to like 4.30 in the morning.
It's a good time.
That's like me on the Lara Croft game, but obviously this is for different reasons.
Is it just the nostalgia factor that's getting you, or are you really having fun just kind of button mashing and beating them up?
All of that.
I mean, hell, I actually went out and bought an arcade fighter joystick just to play this game with.
Wow.
And I just automatically adjusted to the joystick and played through the game.
That is hardcore.
Yes.
That's awesome.
Wow.
Tell us a little bit about how the game kind of changes as it progresses.
Because something I noticed, like, in the demo I was playing, I was like, okay, well, this is kind of, you know, repetitive.
It's button mashing, da-da-da.
But then I noticed, like, as you level up, oh, you start getting new moves.
And then as you go into the shops, you can kind of enhance the strength and so forth.
Does that kind of evolution continue as you move on?
Yeah, something like that.
Like, as every level goes on, the game gets progressively harder and harder, but you get more coins and more money.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
That and I looked at the leaderboards of my friends.
I was determined to pretty much get to the top of the ladder out of my friends list, which I did.
Last I recall, I'm ranked like 2,200 and everybody else is like in the 4,000s.
That still means there's 2,199 people better than you.
That means I'm going to have to go through every single one of them to get to the top.
That's right.
Number one guy has like over $9 million in the game.
I'm like, well...
I've got my work cut off for myself.
It's a good thing he's not playing Final Fantasy XIV or he would have got cut off by now.
All right.
Any other thoughts for our listeners tonight, Ranma, before I take some more calls?
I was going to talk about the whole online passing, but we'll save that for another time because that's like another 10 minutes of me ranting and losing my mind.
All right.
No problem.
I'm sure there'll sadly be more stories on it as we move on.
And there's folks asking for your gamer tag in chat, so you might want to share.
Oh, I'll type it out in the chat room right now.
Alright, well, Ranma, thank you so much for calling in.
Have a great week, and of course, stay black, my friend.
L'chaim!
Alright, take care.
Let's go to the phones and take another call.
Hi, you're on... I had my mouth full of taco.
You had your mouth full... Was that a taco laugh?
Alright, I've got another call.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
Hey, it's Tiara!
Tiara, my friend!
Long time no chat, how are you?
I'm doing very good, how are you?
I am great, but I'd be better if I was in Vegas.
Oh yeah, and speaking of Vegas, the reason I called is because I have to tell you about the This is Vegas game.
The reason that they're not making it anymore is because I had to send out a cease and desist letter because they were copying my life.
What?
What?
Yeah, I mean, I didn't mind, you know, the dancing, the gambling, you know, going out on the strip, but when they got to the part with punching people, I had to draw a line.
I see.
So, basically, because it was an unauthorized biography of Tiara, you had to cease and desist them.
Exactly.
Ruining gamer dreams everywhere.
I know.
I also had to put a stop on Boobville, so that's...
DarkSakura.com
and I played it and I played it for a while and it was like it sucked up a couple of hours of my life because it's kind of addicting it is very addicting which is weird because it's kind of stupid like I'm playing this game and I'm like this game is so stupid but I keep hoping that I'll get picked to play clock game and then I'm like oh if I get to level five I'll get to unlock a new pricing game and I'm really excited about that why because I'm a sad person you have Plinko
Not yet.
All I ever see... Well, the game is still in beta, but all I ever see is Clock Game and Safe Crackers.
Yeah, I always get Safe Crackers.
There's another one you get to unlock at level 5.
But I have found that I am a terrible shopper.
I have yet to be called up to play a pricing game.
But, but, but, this is important, I am an awesome wheel spinner.
And I almost always get 95 cents or a dollar.
Just saying.
Oh, nice.
Yeah, I always weigh under bid.
The things that they have for bid, it's like nobody's going to pay as much money as the game says, and it seems like it's way more overpriced than the actual Price is Right television show.
You just have to remember real people like you and me shop at places like Ikea and Target, and the Price is Right apparently buys all of their stuff at the Galleria, Versace, and all that good stuff.
Apparently so, yeah.
Anyways, I just wanted to call and say hi.
Well, thank you so much for the phone call.
I'll tell you the story behind the This is Vegas.
Well, I appreciate it.
I wish you would stop ruining the dreams of gamers everywhere, but maybe you'll let us have something fun in the future.
Well, you guys can come down to Vegas and I'll show you around.
You know what I would love to do if I don't have anything else planned this year?
I would love to take a Christmas trip to Vegas.
Yeah, that would be fun.
Christmas ain't no big deal to you anymore, right?
Let's go.
Depending on if I get a certain house.
Oh, I'm shopping for a house.
If I get one with an extra bedroom, you could probably even crash.
That would be awesome.
Oh, yes, and just so the chat knows, yes, Tiara has some type of clicking sound in the background.
We'll just say Clicky the pen is trying to infiltrate Orange Lounge Radio.
We'll just leave it at that.
I don't know what that's all about.
Damn, Clicky.
Damn, Clicky.
It returned.
The ghost of Clicky passed.
Yeah, I don't know.
This mic is very, very crazy with the clicking.
Sometimes it comes up.
Sometimes it just randomly disappears.
I think it's actually the doctor is coming to kidnap me, and it's the sonic screwdriver, but it's malfunctioning, so it makes a clicky noise instead of a... Well, you did get
The Giggling Girl comic show again?
Yeah, it kind of is, except for there's a dude now.
So it's two giggling girls and a dude.
A giggling dude.
Men ruining everything.
Where can I get it?
Where can I download it?
Is it ready?
It's going to be on infamousgamers.com and that's infamous without an I. So N-F-A-M-O-U-S gamers.com N Famous Gamers.
Sounds good.
All right.
Well, Tiara, thanks so much for your call.
Good luck with the podcast since DarkSakura's on it.
I'm sure it'll be a challenge.
But I'm kidding.
I'm kidding.
Oh, you should see the death stare I just got.
It was pretty awesome.
You owe me ice cream.
I don't eat ice cream.
Good luck.
There's your ice cream.
All right.
Tiara, thank you so much for your phone call.
Stay black and we'll talk to you next time.
Alright, thanks.
Alright, take care.
1-877-GAME-OLR or use him on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
I think I'm just going to say that to all the callers tonight.
Just, you know, why not?
Alright, 1-877-GAME-OLR or use him on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
While we wait for some calls, Loki, do we have any last minute stories tonight?
Snoop Dogg
Alright, let's go to the phones.
We've got more calls coming in.
But they're produced exclusively for Rock Band.
Hold on, we're getting hammered with calls.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
Hello?
I think they hung up.
Hi, Orange Launch Radio.
You there?
Nope, it ended.
They hung up.
Trigger finger, I don't know.
Let's go to another call.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
Hey, this is X-Link.
Hi, X-Link.
How are you, my friend?
Doing good.
Doing well.
Watching my fiance over here playing on my iTouch, the How Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader, so...
Ah, that show.
I can't believe they let Jeff Foxworthy host a game show.
But speaking of game shows, the prices right on Facebook is a complete crap.
Really?
You are hating, alright?
I'm hating it.
Why are you hating it?
It's a completely watered down version of the PC game.
Just spend 20 bucks by the PC game, just go through it and you can unlock every single one of those games and play as much as you want.
Don't sit there spending $7, $8 trying to unlock every single one of those games, which you can do the same thing for $20, maybe even a little less, and you can find it somewhere on sale or even on eBay or something.
But will the PC game allow me to post how I'm doing in the game so I can show off my EP into the world?
Why not just take a screenshot and do the same thing?
Well, will it let me possibly, if my team score is high enough, win a trip to LA to see a backstage...
Taping or whatever it was called.
Why would you want to do that when you're already near LA as it is?
I'm not that close.
Hey, apparently I'm not able to fly there as I learned this week.
Burning down planes and everything.
I'm just that awesome, I guess.
Burning down the house.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Same thing with the iTouch versions of Price is Right and Press Your Luck were both also watered down versions of the PC ones.
Some of those iPod games are really horrible.
And I'll tell you, I finally was able to upgrade to the iPhone 4 this week.
I didn't talk about it earlier in the show because I had other video games to talk about.
But I finally, being the sheep I am, I upgraded to an iPhone 4.
One of the great things about it is that now it has the speed to actually be able to play a lot of the games that are out there for it.
But some of them aren't worth my time.
Like there's a port of Sonic 2 available, which, you know, don't get me wrong.
I love Sonic and Sega makes some great games.
But the frame rate, even on the iPhone 4, is kind of junky.
And just controlling with the touchscreen is kind of crap.
Like it just doesn't make for a good experience.
Not everything in the world has to be on the frigging iPhone, you know.
I agree.
I'm a big fan of a lot of different games, and a lot of games, when they try to port it over, it was turning into absolute crap.
It's like, what did they do with this?
Why did they do this in the first place?
It's really interesting though just how saturated the marketplace has become.
They say it's almost impossible to make money in there now because it's just so, so saturated.
It takes so much for your game to stick out amongst everything that's out there that a lot of people are really struggling.
I totally agree.
I mean, nothing against any of these games.
I love Price is Right.
I love that kind of stuff.
And the only reason why I didn't blast it out to everybody on my Facebook page is because I didn't really want everybody to be playing it.
I looked at it, and I'm like, at first, it wasn't even loading.
It wasn't even loading at first.
It was coming up as a blink screen.
And when they did it, it was like, when I saw it, I'm like, no, I'm not doing this.
To be fair, to play Devil's Advocate just a little bit, the game is still in beta, so it's not going to be perfect.
I just got to throw that out there.
Yes, but I'd rather pay my $20 PC game that I bought.
I guess one point you do make, you only get to play so many games of The Price is Right for free, and then if you want more coins, you have to buy them with real money.
So I totally get your point.
Don't spend real money on this game if you could just plop down $20 and get a superior game.
I'll agree with that.
or even cheaper depending on where you buy it from.
I mean, I've seen it even on sale as low as $10 depending on what place it's from.
So, I mean, yes.
I mean, you know, like I said before, it's worth the wait.
And the games are really good.
I mean, they did a really good job with Press Your Luck.
I love it for the PC.
I play it all the time.
I love how there's 17 different episodes you can go through and unlock different stuff.
But as for the other versions, other than maybe that and the Wii, it was crap.
It was like they just threw it out there without even knowing what was going on.
And I would love to see the PlayStation version have like avatar support, but unfortunately, like I said before, the reason it didn't is because of the fact that it was a bad replica of the port basically from that of the PC or the Wii.
Alright, well anything I gotta wrap up here, anything else you wanna talk to our listeners about tonight, real quick?
Nah, that's pretty much it, that's all I know to say, that and the fact at this point that Civ 4 demo won't be coming out to the day of, but Civ 5, but yes, it's not coming out to the day of I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I was I've been so behind you myself There's too many damn games to keep track of these days, it's alright Alright, well thank you for the call my friend really appreciate it, have a wonderful week and stay black You too, 5,000 What'd he say at the end there?
I missed that.
I missed it too.
I hope it wasn't another plain joke because, yeah, they frown on those.
Alright, that's it for the Skype line tonight.
Thank you guys so much for calling.
We appreciate it.
Sorry if you didn't get through, but please, you can always send us an email, a tweet.
It's not too much to ask.
140 characters or less.
Loki, any stories you want to get out here before we finish?
Yeah, I was just checking that right now to see if there was anything we didn't talk about.
You know what, Tigerclaw's throwing one out in chat I'll mention real quick.
I don't remember hearing this either unless Matt had just covered it before in the last one.
There's an Epic Mickey Collector's Edition.
Did you mention that?
No, I didn't mention that, but whatever
They had also a new collector's edition for Dead Rising 2 where you can actually get it from Capcom.
It comes with a bunch of poker chips and custom poker cards and stuff like that.
And then also a chance to win a six foot tall life-size statue of a zombie.
But that's only, you know...
I thought at first, before I actually read the article, that it was every single package.
I was like, oh, gonna buy that instantly.
But obviously that would be way too expensive.
But that's something that they're gonna be giving away.
Let's see.
Stuff that maybe we didn't talk about.
Ah, yes.
Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep is not coming to the PlayStation Network.
So if you own a PSP Go, you ain't playing that game.
Thank you Square Enix Um
See, we talked a little bit about Angry Birds.
I guess the devs working with Hollywood Advisors on a possible movie pitch.
They will probably accept it because they're desperate for stuff.
The full track list for DJ Hero 2 got released.
Well, by track list, it means the songs that they will be using in the mixes.
Some cool stuff, though, I actually like.
It was funny, one of the songs I was actually almost going to pick for a Cage Mackenzie.
and still might pick the Prodigy Omen off their new album is on there and of course the classic Firestarter is part of that as well some new Tiesto tracks on there Speed Rail I Will Be Here and Come On
lots of Lady Gaga, actually.
They're going to have Love Game, Bad Romance, and Just Dance in there as well.
Of course, Connie West, Love Lockdown, and Heartless.
And then they've got some random old school stuff in there, like they have...
Janet Jackson, Axl F, Gorillaz, Stylo, Donna Summers, Bad Girls,
New Order's Blue Monday is going to be in there.
Orbital with the box.
That's pretty awesome they have Orbital in there.
Salt and Pepper's Push It.
And then it's kind of cool Justice is going to be in there as well with D.A.N.C.E.
and also Waters of Nazareth.
I don't remember Waters of Nazareth but I did put in D.A.N.C.E.
in Cage Match so that's kind of cool.
But yeah, lots of cool stuff.
Only one Daft Punk song, so that's a little depressing.
Human After All is in there.
Basement Jackson, Where's Your Head At?
Yeah, lots of cool stuff.
Very excited about it.
In fact, actually, they have a Facebook app that you can check out that's a contest where you're supposed to guess what the mashups are, and they're kind of giving you a little bit of a preview of some of the songs that are actually going to be in the game, the sets and stuff.
So that's kind of neat.
So check that out.
Alright, I wonder if there's any standalone songs, because there were a few of those in year one, like Herbie Hancock.
There might be some beat juggles or whatever, so that could be cool.
I don't know.
We'll see.
Alright, well if that's it for Last Minute Stories, then I guess it's time to go around and get everybody's final thought.
It's time to end another show.
Boo hoo, sad.
Final thoughts tonight.
DarkSakra, what's your final thought tonight?
My arms hurt.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Loki, you have a final thought tonight?
One last thing I was going to say.
Portal is also going to become part of the syllabus at apparently Wabash College.
It's actually, you know, I don't think you have to read it, but obviously play it.
Heck of a final thought.
Yeah, but no, my final thought is I have a headache from lack of sleep and I don't anticipate it going away and that sucks.
My final thought is, back to work tomorrow, back to the real world.
Boo-hoo, cry, sob.
But hey, three-day weekend coming up.
Yay!
Labor Day.
Yay!
That's right, that's next weekend.
That's right, this coming weekend.
Ah, that's why we're doing the, it all makes sense now.
