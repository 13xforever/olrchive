14155	25595	Tonight, August 1st, 2010, a big MMO plans a free-to-play model, Valve accidentally bans 12,000 players, and the creator of Ultima wins $28 million from his former company.
31584	36326	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36386	41909	We are that program dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle.
41949	44590	We are that show where every gamer has a voice.
44950	45850	My name is Rob Roberts.
45870	48452	I'll be joining you over the next few hours here at All Games Radio.
49432	50153	DarkSakura, Jamie Summers
67928	70990	I didn't know you were dining on meat this week.
71330	76573	Every so often I dine on the meat, but I do not necessarily chow on the cow, and I definitely don't dine on the swine.
76693	78455	Chow on the cow and dine on the swine, alright.
78495	80756	Remember I got that from Danielle back in the day.
81368	84171	Loki is not here tonight
99847	104068	Loki's not here because this is the day that we knew was going to be coming for some time.
104268	109589	Loki's going to be out for a few shows because Miss Loki went into labor this morning at 11 a.m.
109970	110630	That's all we know.
110690	112110	We don't have a lot of updates other than that.
112650	116251	The baby is not here, or at least the arrival has not been announced on Facebook.
116511	119732	But if I were Loki, I would not be running to Facebook to announce the birth first thing.
120416	128000	My guess is that they do have a tiny one right now who is currently doing a lot of sleeping as is mommy.
128840	137545	So during sleep time we should start seeing the messages because the body goes through quite a lot of hell in childbirth.
140063	141425	Being born is hard work.
143326	145007	It's a lot of pushing.
145027	147690	So we do have some guests here.
147850	153134	Because this all happened this morning, we weren't really prepared to have another co-host come in.
153174	154735	We are going to have something a little more permanent.
155376	158078	Well, not permanent because obviously Loki's not being replaced.
158118	158979	God know he'll come back.
159719	165344	But for about the next month or so while Loki's off being a daddy, we'll have a more long-term co-host next week.
165924	167185	But for now, we have some special guests.
167205	167786	I have a co-host, Rob.
168126	168506	What's that?
168526	171208	Where is it?
171228	172208	Aha, your co-host fails.
172328	172608	All right.
172948	174369	My co-host is turned from me.
177571	179352	Okay, the batteries are dying on the Dalek.
179412	180292	That ought to tell you something.
180332	181193	No, it's not dying.
181633	182813	It needs to exterminate itself.
183414	185135	We do have some guests here in studio tonight.
185195	186395	Let's say hello first, too.
186655	190377	And I've met both of these guests for the first and second time tonight.
190437	193959	So I apologize if I'm mispronouncing you, but you're Mila?
194019	194199	Myla.
194219	194379	Myla.
195080	195520	Myla Minoki.
196580	197541	How are you, Myla Minoki?
197561	197601	Hi.
200222	204244	and I'm glad to be a guest on the show.
204444	204964	We don't wait.
205004	207885	We're not hearing you at all and I'm trying to figure out why.
208065	208685	Turn my mic.
209346	211206	See Rob, you were afraid that my mic was going to be crappy.
211286	212007	What is going on?
212087	213247	Is the switch on?
213287	214328	That's always a common mistake.
215348	216468	Now much better.
217609	219650	First rule of radio, turn your mic on.
220010	222471	Let's try this from the top.
222551	222831	Myla!
223311	223892	Hi there!
223932	224272	How are you?
224633	225554	I'm doing fantastic.
226795	233403	I was actually turned on to the show by our wonderful intern, Drunami, and I guess I'm the sub-intern?
233603	235085	I guess I count as the sub-intern?
235105	236266	You're the intern's intern.
236707	237748	I'm the intern's gopher.
237968	238769	Yeah, I'm the gopher.
238910	239450	You're the gopher.
239470	239711	Damn it!
240911	244794	You have a lot in common gaming-wise with intern Drew, right?
244854	245574	Yes.
245734	248235	You described yourself to me as a budget gamer.
248255	249356	That's the type of video games you're into?
249376	249596	Yes.
250216	254519	If it costs less than $10, I've usually either played it or bought it.
255539	260782	I'm usually very much on the budget gaming, so much so that my MMO of choice is RuneScape.
260902	261182	Why?
261202	261963	Because it's free.
262970	263551	Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary
280273	280954	Yep, that's me.
281074	281634	How you doing, Gary?
282395	282855	I'm alright.
283576	284056	Glad to be here.
284276	284516	Yes.
284877	285737	He's a friend of Punk Night.
286298	286578	Really?
287359	290961	Everybody is so randomly connected to OLR somehow.
290981	291662	I've got to figure this out.
291682	295005	You might know me as Mindstorm or SMF2045 online.
295265	295445	Okay.
295465	296025	Either one of those.
296426	296746	Right on.
296766	297907	That'd be SMF.
298427	298948	Getting back.
299088	299848	Yeah, whatever.
300969	301730	It's an acronym.
301770	302911	I'll explain later.
302931	303051	I know.
303751	306093	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
323446	324327	Not entirely true.
324707	325267	Okay, okay.
325668	329230	I got the impression you're more of a games that involve more than six sides on my dice.
329310	336756	Yes, I'm a tabletop gamer, but thanks to DarkSakura, I picked up SimCity 3, and when I get a chance to play it, I love it.
336776	337356	SimCity?
337476	338597	Sims 3.
338737	339057	Sims 3.
339698	340258	Yes.
340498	341979	There was a SimCity 3, I believe.
342039	342540	No, SimCity 3000.
342760	344681	No, wait till I get you Modnum.
346222	348124	No, I left off SimCity a long time ago.
348284	349605	I just downloaded Boob Sliders.
350947	352429	This isn't the first time I've met Gary.
353251	355736	The first time I met Gary was at Jamie's rock band party.
355896	356878	Oh yes, rock band.
356898	358021	The beer potluck.
358902	360465	Oh yes, that was technically the beer potluck.
360485	361487	I don't remember the beer potluck.
361507	361928	When was that?
362822	365583	Your mic is dying.
366064	369406	Ouch, my ears.
370126	373908	I told everyone to bring beer so we could have a beer potluck.
375128	376749	Gary brought meat, which was almost as good.
377290	380912	Yeah, because I don't drink.
381932	384493	I still have one Guinness left from that time, Rob.
384954	385394	One Guinness.
386034	387995	I'm going to drink the fuck out of that Guinness.
388375	391137	You'll be able to skip a meal when you do because Guinness is liquid bread.
391670	392592	Oh, yummy.
393033	397581	But that's going to be my celebration for being off Vicodin because my hand is fucked up even more now.
398322	399785	And by the way, thanks for the peach beer.
399805	400366	It was delicious.
400805	404347	Yes, I couldn't, you remember I couldn't drink the peach Lombek?
404527	404887	Oh yeah.
405248	406428	I gave it to her.
406508	406688	Nice.
406889	407369	It was wonderful.
407469	408349	I loved it.
408530	410251	So now for the story.
410751	411211	Yay.
411291	411932	Oh, story time?
412272	412532	Yes.
412552	413673	This is how we met.
414033	415133	Actually, Myla.
415494	416354	Yeah.
416394	417855	We skip names all the time.
417895	423839	Anyway, Gary tells me that on our way to Shul downtown that we're picking up somebody.
424819	427921	So I instantly am pounce-hugged by this person.
428382	430684	And I'm like, okay, hi, you're fun.
431244	432145	I instantly like you.
432825	437469	And then she was talking about playing DDR, and I said, oh yeah, I used to moderate on DDR Freak.
437609	438349	It was DarkSakura.
438730	440531	And she's like, from Orange Lounge?
441952	442913	You know Drew!
443433	443993	How funny.
444454	445515	Small world, ain't it?
445535	446015	Yeah, small world.
446075	449818	So we both called him and left him what-the-fuck voice messages.
449878	450618	Wait a minute, wait a minute.
450738	452660	Is tonight on OLR like Jew party?
452840	453981	Is that what this is tonight?
454201	454961	What's the matter?
454981	455882	I don't count.
456502	458604	Oh, I thought you... I'm not yet.
458704	459965	Oh, okay.
460245	461706	The people in this room are only half Jewish.
461746	463968	There's only half Jewish.
464068	464969	I'm Jewish by proxy.
465249	465549	Okay.
466269	466530	All right.
466550	470453	So we have Jew, Jew by proxy, Jew in training, and not Jew.
470833	471133	Okay.
472074	472434	Just kidding.
473134	473495	And gay.
473515	477557	The short word for not Jew is goy.
477617	484101	Welcome to the world of oppressed peoples.
484641	486523	But I love the Jewish people.
486603	490065	I would say I'm not a fag hag, but I'm a Jew hag.
490105	491486	You're a Jew hag.
491986	493727	What would you call it?
494067	495928	Like somebody who likes to hang out?
496529	497029	You're a goy toy.
497089	497630	A goy toy.
497650	498190	There you go.
500972	501292	Alright.
502673	503274	Don't mind us.
503354	504815	We're geeks, we're gamers, and we're fun.
505135	506616	And very silly.
506856	511780	Honestly, guys, this is one of those weeks where I don't know why we're doing a show tonight.
511940	512481	Honestly.
513302	514543	Why not?
514603	516124	We need this, Rob.
516164	517585	For some reason, guys, like...
517865	522649	We decided to do the trial Facebook ad campaign this week, which I'll talk about in a minute.
523070	526412	It's not a big deal, but we're trying to get word out there more about the show.
526833	530016	And so we probably have some brand new people listening for the first time tonight.
530036	530576	We're sorry.
530836	533198	And I'm thinking to myself... Apologies in advance.
533238	535921	Please go back in the archives and listen.
535961	537702	Like, 374 was a good show.
538203	541125	I'm glad that you have these numbers memorized, because I sure as hell don't.
541225	542987	Hey, how do you know it's not going to be a good show tonight?
543908	544568	No, it'll be fine.
544608	545309	We're going to have fun.
546089	547090	and that being really fun.
547210	550233	Especially when we're completely just thrown off our patterns.
550313	551814	The random is hilarious.
551874	557339	I think all of us tonight kind of collectively, well I can't speak for the guests, but I know Jamie and I just kind of don't give a fuck tonight.
557359	557979	At least I don't.
558888	560729	You guys have me on the show, so I know you don't give a fuck.
560769	563772	You guys have me on the show, so it's proof you don't give a fuck.
563892	566214	I gave a fuck, but I don't remember who I gave it to.
566234	567174	Probably Dan.
567655	568535	That's dangerous.
569596	575040	But yeah, there was... We should probably get into the how was our week and day and shit, because there was some stuff.
575060	581705	Well, technically it's how was your gaming week is how we start off, but I know you're dying to talk about why you're off.
581945	583226	I really don't have an excuse.
583487	584968	I'm just... I'm on the rag.
585368	586529	I'm on man rag tonight.
586569	587650	I don't know what you'd call that.
588590	590031	I don't need that.
590091	590912	That's for damn sure.
591332	592333	Need some freshening, Rob?
592373	593354	Do you feel not so fresh?
593374	594074	We could get you a douche.
594094	596616	You know how... You're a douche.
597777	599057	Your face is a douche.
599077	603340	You know how... I'll friend your butt.
603580	605502	I know you know what I'm talking about.
605722	607303	Seventh grade flashbacks.
607343	612927	Somebody will just tell you good morning and you'll want to be like, Why are you looking at me like that?
613187	613387	Okay.
613747	617130	Although that makes it sound like it's about my relationship, which it really is not.
617150	618392	My relationship is awesome.
618792	620614	I think Alan is the best thing ever.
620834	622215	I think Alan is the best thing ever.
622235	622916	It's everything else.
623276	624197	I want him to be my gay boyfriend.
624217	624677	He's bugging me.
625979	626799	You can't have him.
626819	627300	He's mine.
627940	630463	Alright, well anyhow.
630998	632339	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
651940	652881	We don't know any of those.
653741	655382	As I'm eating chips during the show.
655402	656463	S-T-F-U.
656983	658304	Rob, you're eating something kind of healthy.
659265	659605	Kind of.
660426	661426	I had a banana for breakfast.
661546	661767	Anyway.
663107	663788	My husband, Dan...
665894	671640	Age 34, went into the hospital Tuesday morning at a quarter after 3 for congestive heart failure.
672681	673922	My husband is 34 years old.
674703	676024	This is something that you could die from.
677346	680268	Or suffer massive damage to your other organs.
680629	681910	Basically, he was coughing up blood.
682411	682691	Yikes.
683091	684953	And feeling really short of breath.
685434	687275	He didn't have any of the pain or numbness.
687796	689438	So, thankfully, his heart was in good shape.
690458	694061	He went in early Tuesday morning and got to leave Friday afternoon.
694641	696722	Actually, more like Friday evening.
697203	698704	His blood pressure was super high.
698824	712252	Thankfully, after numerous ultrasounds and x-rays and what give you rays and tests and things and prodding, lots of prodding, they determined that all the rest of him worked just fine.
713353	715955	He didn't damage his organs and he could come home.
716415	719177	He's on blood pressure medication now, quite a bit of it.
719837	721280	www.DarkSakura.com
735740	738623	And we've got someone in the room who's been through the similar.
757003	758544	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
774355	774435	Mike,
798843	799764	I am talking on my mic.
800424	801205	It's... LA!
801445	804068	Your connection at the base is... Okay, I'm holding it in.
804088	804788	I'm holding it in.
804808	805429	Yeah, I can hear you.
805829	806089	Okay.
806230	807010	Well, of course you can hear me.
807030	808171	Well, I mean through your mic.
808852	814317	Anyway, let this be a warning to everybody that, you know, don't think this can't happen to me.
814617	823024	You really... And I know, again, it's like with Dan's situation, he wasn't ready to change until he got slapped in the face with it.
823064	823325	Yep.
824045	824686	Ignition Pads 3 of them
852404	856767	for $6 at the thrift store.
856827	858509	I don't know if they work, but they were in good shape.
858609	862452	I'm going to clean the crap out of them, and I'm going to make Dan play some Boom Boom Dollar with me.
862812	864253	Yay!
864873	865654	That sounds awesome.
865674	870498	But that's what my week's been, so really, as far as going into gaming, I ain't played shit.
871578	874039	Except for Ragnarok Online, which I'm playing again.
874480	881183	And really, I played that because it was so mindless that I could just play and not have to think.
881943	883304	Because I wasn't able to sleep.
883464	894169	I went that first day on an hour and a half of sleep and did not go to bed until something like... I took a little nap, which is my hour and a half of sleep, and then I was up until like three in the morning.
894537	895538	Yeah, I can't say I blame you.
895698	908128	And I was up again at 9 the next day, and I just, it's been, I slept really funny, and I've spent, I've never been so freaked out in my life, even though I knew he was in good hands, you know.
909829	914753	And this is the other thing, too, and, you know, I know I'm probably going into a bit of personal detail, but I don't care.
915294	916795	I have a microphone, and I'm going to use it.
916975	919437	Tonight's the feel-good episode of OLR, everybody.
919457	923961	Don't make me bust out the booze, Hila.
926698	935643	At any rate, the way things were going, you know, Dan and I were talking about, you know, we've been talking about having a kid, me and Dan.
935723	939486	I know I've been forthcoming on this on the show because I'm going to totally get Matt to do our nursery.
939906	941087	Aw, mini Sakura, yay!
942379	946840	Is this a tangent where I can mention that Matt's nursery was actually on Game Informer?
946880	947800	Was it?
948561	950441	Is that a big blog or magazine?
950501	951241	I'm going to be honest.
951481	954082	Game Informer is the one that's sponsored by... Are they the GameStop one?
954202	954382	Yes.
954582	956883	Okay, his nursery was on that.
957363	959223	But it had nothing to do with OLR.
959343	961624	They found his pictures on Flickr.
962304	962584	DarkSakura.com
988665	992990	However, you can copyright the photos and then they have to pay you.
994932	995973	In this case, it's good news.
996033	998515	But you just got to be careful what you put up on the internet.
998615	1001959	If it hadn't been good news, you want to be careful.
1002239	1004882	Just be careful what you say on your Facebook accounts.
1004922	1009326	People have gotten fired from jobs because they said something their bosses didn't like.
1009466	1013529	That's why mine is fully blocked and I really don't allow photo tagging.
1013890	1017092	If someone's tagged my stuff, I go look it up and only let the stuff I tag myself.
1017132	1020715	I hate that Facebook does not let you approve what you get tagged in.
1020815	1023177	But nobody can see my stuff.
1024057	1025358	Nobody who's not a friend of yours.
1025939	1026339	Exactly.
1026960	1028321	And I don't allow friend-to-friend viewing.
1029301	1029742	Understood.
1031143	1031643	Sorry, Jamie.
1031683	1032844	Back to your traumatic week.
1032924	1033324	Yes.
1034369	1035269	So please, share with us.
1035630	1043534	Anyway, well, you know, Dan and I were talking about having a kid, and I totally don't want to really do it until I'm sure he's going to stick with this.
1044054	1059802	As much as I would like one, I want to make sure that, you know, and we were actually, the ironic thing is that we were talking about that Tuesday, Monday during the day, is, you know, how, and I wasn't so much worried about him dying, I was worried about him not being able to keep up with the kid, you know, because Dan's a big guy.
1060782	1063644	And now I'm actually worried about maybe, you know, him dying.
1064284	1068186	And I'm, you know, I'll say right now, I'm 34 years old.
1068806	1071848	You know, Dan and I are coming up on our 5th anniversary on September 1st.
1072308	1074809	We've been together for almost 14 years as of January.
1075810	1080752	And, you know, I never thought for an instant I was ever going to have to be without him.
1081312	1082073	So it was...
1082853	1083574	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
1105832	1116222	People out there, if you have a significant other or someone in your family that is at risk, you need to sit down and have the talk with them because when they think it can't happen, it does.
1118036	1141021	and so you know even though we're being one of those game podcasts yet another one that doesn't actually seem to talk about games for 30 minutes this is important because you know if you are you know sitting there and you're you're down in Doritos and maybe you're a little bit fluffy you know I love that word fluffy chances are me too I think it's a Gabriel Iglesias I think you know and it happens to all of us I'm feeling a little fluffy right now in fact
1141741	1144522	My grandma's got a refrigerator magnet that says I'm not fat, I'm fluffy.
1144743	1145503	My boobs are fluffy.
1145803	1149265	It's something to watch out for if you spend lots of time sitting.
1149285	1152726	I used to work in an office and play games, didn't get much exercise.
1153246	1154987	It was a wake-up call earlier this year.
1155047	1155747	God bless the Wii.
1156127	1158528	Even if you're not well, I don't know about that.
1158568	1159469	I don't know if I'd go that far.
1159969	1162010	I still want to borrow your Wii Fit.
1162270	1166833	Even if you're not fluffy, take time to evaluate.
1167754	1170255	Am I going outside enough?
1170436	1172417	Am I walking?
1172677	1177420	Am I maybe eating not so good as I could be?
1177620	1180442	The straight Cheetos diet is not necessarily good for you.
1180482	1183124	This is going to be our big thing.
1183344	1185866	Watch the refined carbohydrates.
1186446	1187487	Watch the processed foods.
1188328	1190309	Seriously, even if it says low sodium on the can...
1190669	1191830	DarkSakura.com.
1208999	1209359	DarkSakura.com
1227038	1231643	Well, yeah, that's a given, but you'd be surprised how hard that is sometimes.
1231663	1234806	You'd be surprised how much shit you're eating.
1234886	1237228	And I'm honest, I eat a lot of shit.
1237588	1239210	And I really need to cut back on that.
1239370	1241011	And you smell like it.
1241091	1243774	I'm not, I don't mean actual poop shit.
1244014	1245756	I mean crappy food.
1245956	1246236	Bad food.
1246276	1249399	Like McDonald's, Burger King, all that fast food crap.
1249699	1250280	You know...
1250840	1253704	Everybody knows you're not stupid people.
1254024	1256227	You know how to download a podcast on the internet.
1256347	1257028	You're not dumb.
1257789	1259972	You know what's good for you and what's not good for you.
1260172	1262795	And it's okay to indulge once in a while.
1264017	1266540	I don't know where I would be in this world without Chicken McNuggets.
1267781	1269942	But you don't order the 20 pack of chicken McNuggets.
1270062	1271222	And you don't do it every day.
1271402	1272342	Get a Happy Meal.
1272362	1273063	For one person.
1273143	1273723	Get a Happy Meal.
1273923	1274103	Yeah.
1274723	1283406	You know, the other bit of advice I have with this, and Dan is thankfully learning this now, is just the eat when you're hungry, stop when you're not.
1283566	1285486	Not when you're full, when you're not hungry.
1285686	1293409	And you also need to make sure you eat at regular intervals, breakfast, lunch, dinner, and maybe a small snack in between, but don't eat super late and stuff like that.
1293709	1294789	I eat it eight times a day.
1295675	1298117	Yes, that's good if you eat small meals a day.
1298137	1300019	But I eat about 100-200 calories a pop.
1300119	1300619	There you go.
1300639	1301560	That's a small meal.
1301841	1305063	But as long as I stick with my mostly raw food, I don't have to track what I eat.
1305444	1307125	The one problem is that I don't get enough sodium.
1308366	1308686	Irony.
1308887	1309908	You have the opposite problem.
1310108	1311209	I have the opposite problem, yep.
1311249	1311909	Interesting.
1312209	1315693	Because I eat mostly fruits and vegetables, and they're raw and processed.
1316453	1318375	If they're processed, it's because I threw them in my blender.
1319755	1343105	But I know you eat beef occasionally Sometimes When the PMS monster hits We don't talk about that I talk about it all the time This is important to say There's nothing wrong if you are a little fluffy Everybody's a little fluffy It's fine Love yourself the way you are But make sure that you pay attention to your health Just be fluffy and healthy
1343425	1345346	Low Weight Obesity
1370191	1374903	Meaning that they had a higher range of fat to muscle ratio than these other people did.
1374943	1375625	Never heard of that.
1375745	1376768	Low weight obesity.
1379127	1379587	Thanks for watching!
1400643	1400903	True.
1400923	1401203	True enough.
1423513	1430138	We do reach a wide audience on this show, so if we can save one other person from having to go to the hospital, then... I was so mad.
1430178	1430478	20... I was mad.
1430998	1431679	Your mic again.
1431899	1432699	Your mic's mad at you.
1432799	1433720	Okay.
1433940	1434841	I was mad.
1435541	1437903	I mean, once I got over being worried, I was mad.
1438443	1441265	Because honestly, who does he have to blame for what happened to him?
1441846	1442146	Himself.
1443567	1446569	When my jeans get snug, who do I have to blame for that?
1447030	1449652	Well, sometimes I have, you know, PMS to blame for that.
1450012	1452514	But usually it's me.
1453275	1455796	You know, we have to be responsible for ourselves.
1456037	1464703	Nothing, like all those morons out there who are out there suing McDonald's and shit because, Oh, I ate your hamburgers and I got overweight.
1465004	1466885	Well, don't eat the damn food, stupid.
1468326	1468967	End of story.
1470368	1472509	You know, so anyway, I'm sorry for going off that.
1472529	1473270	So how about my games, Rob?
1473740	1474521	How about your games?
1474541	1475462	You already mentioned games.
1475482	1476143	You didn't play a lot.
1476183	1477865	But Star Trek Online Episode 2 came out.
1478086	1478186	Oh.
1478406	1484654	Which I got... Now, my hand has been killing me because... Oh, on top of all this crap with Dan, my hand's infected.
1485195	1485795	Yay!
1485875	1487117	When I move my finger, it squishes.
1488140	1488701	That's not good.
1506038	1508019	Star Trek Online Warp Core Breach Warp Core Breach
1532071	1533132	I meant eject the warp core.
1533332	1536934	Of course, my mind goes to the drink automatically, but yeah, eject the warp core because of a breach.
1536954	1538375	Because that was like every episode of Star Trek.
1538395	1539316	They had to eject the warp core.
1539336	1542297	You know, I did find that the warp core breach was a legitimate drink from the show.
1543038	1544118	Huh.
1544819	1546800	And he pulled it out in the same bowl and everything.
1547401	1547781	Cork did.
1548541	1548921	Good times.
1548961	1549222	Anyway.
1549522	1549762	All right.
1550863	1551743	Is that it for your gaming week?
1553784	1554145	Oh, yeah.
1554645	1558928	Dan's buddy, Will, started Crackdown 2, so we just kept making fun of the boss.
1559568	1560549	Like, shut up, dude.
1560589	1560929	We know.
1562352	1562772	So anyway.
1564694	1571399	My gaming week, you know, obviously I played a lot of Warcraft as a chatter earlier said, but yourself.
1573941	1581447	Our little raid group finally cleared the Trial of the Champion on Ten Man, which yes, I know is like behind where most guilds are at right now, but we just started raiding like
1581807	1583128	Last month, so shut up.
1583348	1583808	We're awesome.
1584668	1585148	So that was fun.
1585789	1591691	And other than that, though, I've been trying to play games other than WoW, but I didn't have a lot of success this week.
1591771	1593712	I did play some Game Room.
1593932	1596353	I played Frostbite on Game Room, which just came out.
1596373	1599994	That's an old, old, old school Atari 2600 game that I remember from when I was a kid.
1600014	1610238	We used to stay up and play that for hours, and it's still kind of cool, although I think a lot of you that don't get the classic gaming thing will not get this either, so I don't expect everybody to run out and download it.
1610438	1611058	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
1631734	1648531	as an assassin before I was playing the paladin-y type of class that was more of a defender and it's just like the matches went on forever but as an assassin I'm just like cutting people left and right it's awesome and this time I hope to not miss any side quests like I did the first time you know that reminds me of when you were going around saying bitch I cut you
1649215	1651578	Yeah, it's kind of like that, but now on Puzzle Quest.
1652259	1653160	New games this week.
1653261	1659349	I did check out just the demo for Hydro Thunder Hurricane because I wanted to see, and Jamie's yelling it's awesome.
1660551	1662413	I actually didn't really agree with her.
1662633	1665317	I was just kind of like, eh, it's okay.
1666879	1677290	There's something about playing that game in a big old cabinet at the arcade with other people that was much more fun to me than sitting at home in my chair playing it on my Xbox controller.
1677390	1677771	I don't know.
1677871	1678792	I just wasn't feeling it.
1679533	1681335	The graphics didn't do it for me either.
1681355	1682596	There's just something about it.
1682636	1683637	I feel like it wasn't...
1685018	1685479	Awesome.
1685659	1688420	But, you know, again, I'm only playing a demo.
1688860	1690321	I'm not trying to review the whole game.
1690361	1693603	I'm just saying, was I sold on the game based on what I played?
1693903	1694163	Nah.
1694543	1697244	So I ended up passing on the full version.
1697564	1703367	Jamie's yelling she bought the full version, but she is not in a mic right now, so we can't hear her.
1703467	1704808	We can't hear you.
1705448	1705748	Let's see.
1707049	1708450	So what else did I play this week?
1708610	1713774	Sadly, I didn't play StarCraft 2, although it seems like everybody's been playing that because I haven't picked it up yet.
1714255	1717237	It's too much money right now.
1717497	1719959	It seems to be all that most of you guys are talking about.
1720119	1721961	StarCraft 2, DC Universe.
1722945	1741531	DC Universe I'm excited about there's that new trailer out for DC Universe that looked pretty hot Dan got Starcraft 2 and it's gorgeous and the collector's edition comes with all the old versions and we did get Hydra Thunder Hurricane except I can't play it right now and he loves it but he loved the old one too really?
1741711	1750134	I don't know maybe I was just in a bad mood you'll have to see the new levels the level in I think it's in Turkey it's gorgeous
1751395	1752996	There was some interesting mechanics with it.
1753036	1759040	I didn't hate it, but there's so much other games to play right now that I wasn't like, I want to drop $15 on this.
1759400	1762822	Especially knowing that the Castlevania game is out next week, and I know I'm going to want that.
1762983	1765124	Just based on what games I've liked historically.
1765164	1769607	The problem, I think, with the game so far is the way that you unlock the levels.
1770367	1773689	Because you have to keep playing and keep playing and earn credits, and then you unlock the levels.
1773889	1774930	And it's not as cool.
1775150	1775290	Hmm.
1777072	1778333	Other games I've been playing this week.
1778834	1783139	On the PC, I actually bought a game on Steam called Rhythm Zone.
1784440	1790587	It was a $9 game that is basically Guitar Hero for your computer, but you use the keys to play.
1791208	1795712	I believe you can plug in USB devices, but gonna be honest, didn't really look into that.
1796413	1797494	I just played it with a keyboard.
1798095	1823964	the thing about the game is that yes it has a library of songs that it comes with but it also will make a note chart to any mp3 on your drive as you can possibly imagine if you've ever played one of those DDR games that makes up the steps to the music as it goes along usually the note patterns that show up kind of blow and it's just like let's bang on random keys to my mp3 collection that's really a more appropriate title for the game
1824904	1828025	The game is just a straight up jack of Guitar Hero.
1828245	1834046	Really doesn't add anything new to the mix except for, ooh, I can bang random keys to my MP3s.
1834967	1841308	Also, for some inexplicable reason, the screen likes to slowly rotate to the left and to the right.
1841808	1850051	I don't know why, but suddenly, like, you know, you're doing... Like, imagine if you were playing Guitar Hero and then just suddenly the whole screen started to rotate to the left, like 45 degrees.
1850451	1851591	You'd be like, what?
1852091	1853232	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1870843	1879671	And I guess the one nice thing I could say about it is that it does seem like they have saved room to expand the game later on.
1880592	1888739	So as long as they don't make me pay for any of those expansions, because $9 is already too much for what I got, that might be redeeming.
1889399	1891021	But I'm not gonna hold my breath.
1892222	1893683	Yes, that's Rhythm Zone on Steam.
1894704	1895124	Not a fan.
1895645	1895745	Okay.
1896725	1902327	Let's see, that otherwise is pretty much it, especially as far as new stuff goes.
1902647	1904227	I didn't really play a whole lot of other new stuff.
1904467	1906187	So I'm going to turn it over to Myla.
1906588	1907788	Have you been playing anything this week?
1907808	1908408	New or old?
1908908	1914329	Not only have I been playing something, but I am playing something currently, RuneScape.
1914549	1915290	It's my new crack.
1915990	1916710	Well, it's my old crack.
1916750	1920391	I've been a member of this wonderful game for...
1921511	1923413	Wow, since 1998.
1924153	1925214	We're not hearing you very well.
1925254	1926034	Make sure that mic's good.
1926094	1926515	There you go.
1926815	1927075	Is it up?
1927375	1928977	Yay, yay, it's up.
1929017	1930858	I've been playing RuneScape since 1998.
1931258	1938063	I was a member, or not a member, but a free player back when the wilderness was PvP.
1938443	1939404	What a concept!
1940445	1945589	And then they switched it over to PvP servers, which just made a lot of us just very unhappy.
1945609	1946029	Okay.
1946549	1970663	um but then they released uh about a year ago they released the Dungeoneering skill which is what I'm working on right now and it just it brings a whole new level to the game it's you know originally RuneScape was you know something you played on the weekends when you're bored and didn't have really anything to do and you know you do one skill and then you do another skill and it's just kind of you know kind of monotonous kind of stuff and it's really fun and
1971443	1972164	Thank you for watching!
1987583	1989685	But you also use your crafting skill to make new armor.
1990146	1994710	And you jump into the Dungeoneering levels with no equipment.
1995190	1996912	You build your own equipment.
1996952	1997953	You build your own things.
1998133	2004219	Everything that you do in the Dungeoneering is based off your regular stats.
2004819	2010405	And it's amazing because it really, you know, for those people like me who spent the, you know,
2010745	2011305	Thank you for watching!
2037518	2041962	When you're soloing, it's a little more difficult, but you get more of the feel of the skill.
2042542	2051050	When you're doing the four-member parties, especially in the earlier levels, it really feels like you're just running in a dungeon, wasting everything, and keep going.
2051490	2055874	You know, you're maybe at the boss for like maybe, you know, 15 seconds.
2056335	2059097	That sounds like playing a PSO back in the day.
2059338	2059538	Mm-hmm.
2060498	2064860	But as you go down into the levels, the skill increases.
2065341	2066842	But therein lies the problem.
2067042	2077507	Whenever you start a Dungeoneering level, it takes how many people are going in, and then from there it determines which level you start in.
2078228	2081550	So if you've been soloing for a long time...
2082851	2092660	You'll be at level 14, and the dungeons will be really harder, but if you don't do a lot of the four-mans or three-mans, you'll be stuck at the first couple of levels, and you'll be going, Where's the challenge?
2092900	2093561	What's going on?
2093941	2094641	Everything's easy!
2094762	2095282	What the hell?
2096163	2099646	So it's a little different, but it's really fun.
2100026	2101067	It's really, really fun.
2101148	2103109	Now, RuneScape's been around since 98?
2103289	2103490	Yes.
2103730	2104771	Oh my gosh.
2104871	2105832	It's been around forever.
2106092	2106192	It's...
2107333	2109375	Have they done major makeovers to it since then?
2110276	2111177	It's one of those things.
2111258	2115222	RuneScape, it's been slowly evolving over the years.
2115943	2118245	They'll release a patch here, a patch there.
2118946	2127875	Dungeoneering's really the first full world patch and update that they've done in literally years.
2128796	2129697	Shoot, I'm dying.
2155181	2156041	Are you playing RuneScape right now?
2156061	2158424	Yeah, I'm playing RuneScape right now and I'm just about to die.
2158744	2162347	But the good news is if you die in the Dungeoneering skill, they just pop you back to the home world.
2163148	2169394	You know, the only thing that death in Dungeoneering really accomplishes is, yes, you get a sucky score at the end.
2169594	2170315	That's about all it does.
2172048	2180271	Now there's some folks in chat, I see Drew Nami is in chat and he's saying RuneScape with kind of one of those like, you know, whatever faces.
2180972	2184293	I don't think he's a fan of RuneScape, but it's free, right?
2184353	2184793	It's free.
2185273	2188214	That's one of the... Is it better than Yaris?
2188294	2189455	It's gotta be better than Yaris.
2190095	2193897	Rob, my cat's stinky butt is better than Yaris.
2197288	2200270	TigerClaw in our chatroom says StarCraft 2 is a huge graphical upgrade.
2200310	2201951	It's no longer the pixelated graphics.
2201971	2203231	Everything is all 3D graphics.
2203291	2204172	No, yeah, yeah.
2204252	2207874	All the cinematic areas are in-game, are real-time.
2208134	2220941	No, no, and I understand that, but my point was is that, you know, RuneScape, yeah, it's from 98, and people are still playing it today, which might seem weird, but I was just saying, like, StarCraft was out only one year later than that, and hell of people still playing that.
2221301	2223022	I've been playing Ragnarok Online since 97.
2223803	2224443	Oh, my.
2224823	2225824	Is that game really that old?
2226707	2227107	Pretty old.
2227387	2228068	I can double check.
2229028	2232189	I know it was out in Korea before that, and I was playing on the Japanese servers for a little while.
2232950	2236071	And then I was playing on the open beta for IRO.
2238352	2238812	Old games.
2239512	2240553	I'm still playing it, too.
2240813	2242193	Anything else you want to give a shout-out to in a game?
2244094	2245174	Well, hey, Drew.
2245995	2248276	Other than that, no, not really.
2249316	2252717	I'm literally in the middle of a dungeon right now, and I'm kind of milling through it.
2253098	2254658	All right, we'll try not to suck up all our bandwidth.
2254678	2254978	I won't.
2255058	2255279	I won't.
2256639	2261160	Gary, now I know you said beforehand you weren't too much of a console.
2261240	2262520	Now, you might be a PC gamer?
2262980	2264161	Well, I used to be console.
2264181	2267681	I grew up with an 8 and 16-bit Nintendo.
2268321	2270962	Original Final Fantasy, awesome.
2271182	2274563	I have a PlayStation 2 that hasn't seen much use lately.
2274983	2278423	More as a DVD player than a game console.
2278983	2281244	But I'd get back into it.
2282144	2288726	and I picked up a couple of computer games and I always actively look for interesting looking computer games.
2290066	2293107	I'm seriously looking at Batman Arkham Asylum.
2293947	2294807	That game is great.
2295987	2297448	Okay, another recommendation.
2298208	2301328	The reviews seem to be glowing all around so it's probably something I'm going to have to pick up.
2301568	2307070	If you like the Batman universe, they've got a lot of the voice actors from the animated series.
2307090	2308370	It's good.
2308578	2309138	DC Universe Online
2338427	2366723	if you want to comment on anything we're talking about tonight chat.orangeloungeradio.com is the place to be or on the Game Surge Network we are in channel Orange Lounge we don't use the regular all games chat room I don't know why it's just we always had a separate room and that way when we have a separate room we're in control and have ops and all that stuff we're just control freaks alright let's see so I was going to ask you about tabletop games I know we don't talk a lot about tabletop games but briefly what types of tabletop games do you play?
2367363	2369064	Dungeons & Dragons 4th Edition.
2369204	2370864	Okay, okay, stop with the boos.
2370984	2372064	Stop with the boos.
2373164	2374085	It's not bad.
2374125	2377826	You can do anything, just about anything in 4th Edition you can do into previous ones.
2378426	2382047	I'm clueless when it comes to this stuff because I haven't played D&D in a while.
2382147	2385047	I played a little bit like two years ago, but that maybe lasted a month.
2386228	2388008	Why are people so mad about 4th Edition?
2388348	2389750	Thanks for watching!
2406313	2409835	The teleportation is line of sight, very short distances.
2410815	2412896	But you know, it's not bad.
2413797	2414938	You just gotta give it a try.
2415838	2419621	The teleporting in previous editions, especially in 3rd, was crazy.
2420061	2421362	It got to the point where a party would...
2422142	2427304	Teleport would scry, teleport, and kill the main boss, and that was your whole campaign in the teen levels.
2427845	2430126	And of course, 3.5 D&D tended to break.
2430326	2436768	The entire system broke around 16th to 18th level because they just hadn't... It was a design thing.
2436928	2442451	Yeah, what it kind of reminded me of was the difference between, you know, WoW in the early levels is, you know...
2442751	2443391	Kind of alright.
2443691	2448234	You don't have a lot of things, but you can still level up pretty quickly.
2448354	2453416	With 4th Ed, it almost reminds me of the first couple levels of Final Fantasy XI.
2454036	2456317	Until you get to 10, you're crap.
2457138	2462961	One of the big misconceptions about 4th Edition is it's an MMO on tabletop.
2463381	2465042	No, it's not an MMO on tabletop.
2465102	2468383	Yes, they share terminology with World of Warcraft.
2468783	2471465	It makes it convenient, but you can still do...
2472205	2479076	This is not a ding on computer console games, but you can still do more because you have a living person who can keep making up the story.
2479397	2480879	You're only limited by your imagination.
2480899	2481500	Yes, exactly.
2481540	2482442	Whereas, you know...
2484744	2509936	that's right well yes and you know house rules in a in a home game is the name of the game so I mean you can change the system to a point um and if if there's something that somebody wants to do you know it's just it's it depends on what you like I mean people who don't like fourth edition go play Pathfinder that's fine nothing no problem there I'm glad Paizo was around to put out an alternative for the folks that that didn't like the genre shift but
2510456	2511337	I enjoy Fourth.
2512818	2518821	I'm hoping that they'll license or put out a computer game based on the Fourth Edition rule set.
2519662	2524044	I know Wizards of the Coast was having some issues with Atari as their game publisher.
2524104	2526466	I don't know if those got worked out yet or not.
2527206	2529067	But I like Fourth Edition.
2529147	2532649	I also like hero games, superheroes, champions.
2534090	2534931	I play Champions.
2535471	2538773	Champions is fun, but it's a very, very numbers-heavy game.
2540014	2544737	I'm not a math guy, so I need a character generator to keep the stuff straight.
2544857	2549100	But, eh, you know, I haven't played the Champions Online MMO.
2550281	2558986	I'm told it's very different in its mechanics, and they just licensed... Actually, they bought the Champions name from Hero Games and then licensed it back to them.
2559407	2560487	It's an interesting arrangement.
2560607	2561068	Interesting.
2561508	2562109	Dundracon
2580968	2608751	But yeah, they got 6th edition Hero now Is the current edition of that And I have yet to play it But I'm looking forward to doing something different than D&D very soon I've been playing Dungeons & Dragons since 3rd edition came out Pretty much uninterrupted straight Wow Yeah, steady diet You kind of get tired of it after a little while I just, it's the fantasy thing I'm ready for a genre shift myself I want to do a nice steampunk game
2609071	2620974	Let me get to some comments from our chatroom at chat.orange.com Without turning into a tabletop gaming show, although it is important, you know, a lot of computer games we play today are inspired, like Champions Online is a perfect example, directly inspired by the tabletop universe.
2621014	2623555	Well, without D&D, you wouldn't have World of Warcraft.
2623635	2624115	No way.
2624955	2626516	Or probably even stuff like Final Fantasy.
2626776	2627556	Nope.
2627676	2628116	Let's see.
2628396	2632637	Comments from our chatroom at chat.orange.com Shaoran says, that's not why 4th edition isn't as good.
2632697	2635018	It's not as good because there's next to no customization.
2635218	2635958	That's not true.
2636498	2636838	Oh, boy.
2637419	2637739	All right.
2637779	2639800	How about we save the debate for another time?
2640000	2640601	All right, yes.
2640901	2645043	Monty Boggs says, none of my group wants to spend money on the new books, so we haven't upgraded.
2646604	2649866	Shaoran clarified, though, at least in terms of skills and multi-classing.
2650306	2653368	That's also... No fan of the flames.
2653488	2654689	I will leave it at this.
2655409	2656930	I still love second edition for a reason.
2657952	2659633	Take your THACO and shove it.
2659773	2660053	Yes, I have.
2660073	2662695	Hey, I can calculate my THACO in my sleep, sir.
2662715	2665817	THACO in low saving throws, high attack rolls, yes.
2665937	2669960	Camara says the fourth edition book talked down to me like I was a child.
2670280	2671861	This is what the dice looks like.
2671961	2673042	This is how you roll it.
2673422	2675884	Yeah, that's a problem I've always had with Wizards of the Coast.
2676045	2678107	They don't write very well.
2678167	2680509	The game books aren't written very flavorfully.
2680529	2681390	We miss you, TSR.
2681910	2685373	Yeah, well, actually, that's one thing I like about White Wolf.
2685914	2691799	At least the old World of Darkness, the vampire, the werewolf books were written very flavorfully.
2692200	2694402	You actually could feel the world when you were reading it.
2694702	2700588	Yeah, and then they switched to New World and there was much sighing and gnashing of teeth.
2701009	2702490	We don't talk about New World of Darkness.
2703031	2704533	It's a subject that's left in the closet.
2704553	2707376	We've just made Jodea happy because we're talking about you.
2707396	2711620	I'm pleasantly surprised at what a warm reception the tabletop chat is getting from our chat room.
2711640	2714683	We may have to have a tabletop corner or something in the future.
2714723	2715024	I don't know.
2716386	2716847	I'll do it.
2717267	2718089	TSR is dead.
2718129	2723499	They died of their own money grubbing, but unfortunately it looks like Wizards of the Coast might be going the same way.
2723819	2724641	Eh, that's life.
2725109	2728130	All right, let's get into some housekeeping here so we can get to the video game news of the week.
2728710	2730671	Housekeeping going on here at Orange Lounge Radio.
2731351	2739534	I mentioned a Facebook ad campaign earlier, and just to tell you guys what's going on, it doesn't really directly affect the show, but we decided to try a little something something.
2740054	2741694	We don't make any money doing OLR.
2741734	2742875	I want to make that very clear.
2742935	2744055	We don't have ads during the show.
2744075	2744955	We don't have any on the site.
2745115	2745335	Really?
2745375	2746116	I know.
2746156	2748496	We haven't for eight years made money doing OLR.
2750277	2755359	So the only exception would be donations, which we don't actively solicit them at all.
2755399	2765322	We don't have a PayPal link or anything, but folks in the past have donated generously to the show, and that's kept us definitely going, be it bandwidth, time, whatever it is, not necessarily just money.
2766362	2768183	But we decided, what the hell, let's take...
2768843	2770044	www.facebook.com slash orangeloungeradio
2797162	2798004	We're also on Twitter.
2798024	2799266	We'll be taking Twitter topics later.
2799306	2801230	Twitter.com slash OLR.
2802112	2802492	All right.
2803374	2805438	So that's all I have for housekeeping tonight.
2805498	2807301	So why don't we get into some actual gaming news?
2809082	2809282	StarCraft 2
2827781	2831843	StarCraft 2 sold 1.8 million copies on day one.
2832164	2834605	That's not counting Korea, just so you know.
2834645	2835425	That's not counting Korea?
2835445	2836506	Not counting Korea.
2837286	2839527	So 1.8 million on the first day.
2840328	2842069	That's Americas and Europe.
2843109	2847051	Keep in mind, though, I want to say, didn't World of Warcraft sell a little more?
2847372	2851734	Not original WoW, but like Wrath of the Lich King sold what, like 2.8, I think, on day one?
2851914	2855517	Yeah, can you give us some other numbers for context of that?
2855898	2858300	I want to say World of Warcraft, Wrath of the Lich King, yeah.
2858540	2859461	It's here later in the story.
2860081	2862303	2.8 million units on day one as well.
2862443	2863825	And that's another Blizzard game.
2864085	2864866	But here's the difference.
2865146	2872833	With an MMO, especially one like WoW, there's this huge need to be the first person on the server at level 80.
2873093	2873613	You know what I mean?
2873934	2876116	So there's a lot of people who want to go out and get it right away.
2876836	2881137	StarCraft 2 I think is a little different because I don't think everybody needs to jump on board with that.
2881217	2884818	I didn't jump in right away but you know I was lining up.
2885078	2886558	I didn't line up for Rathalich King.
2886578	2888039	I just went and got it the next day.
2888939	2891860	But there's a lot of people I think that are just kind of chilling with StarCraft 2.
2891900	2893200	They don't have to get it right now.
2893360	2896021	They can wait a little bit or at least for a price drop.
2896041	2897981	But then again, with Blizzard, good luck.
2898521	2899141	Good luck on that.
2899181	2900922	They're still charging $20 for Diablo 2.
2900962	2906103	Yeah, I never heard anyone stressing over missing a raid in anything but World of Warcraft.
2907168	2920537	Yeah, as far as the original StarCraft goes, I actually got my copy from a friend who actually bet me money for whether or not I could beat him at StarCraft.
2921037	2924520	And I didn't know the game, so he's like, here, you borrow my copy.
2925120	2928462	And then I played Zerg and whipped him good, so that teaches him.
2928842	2933746	I'm watching the trailer for StarCraft 2, Wings of Liberty, Ghosts of the Past.
2933786	2934967	Looks intriguing.
2935007	2936888	Wow, that's an interesting monster.
2937969	2939390	Oh, hooray for the Zerg.
2939750	2940911	Hooray for the Zerg.
2941371	2946254	I don't know how I feel about this whole splitting it up into three games, though, because really, you know, I don't know.
2948176	2962606	Well, even for splitting it up into three games, you know, they still gave some outrageous additions to some of the other, you know, like the Zerg, like the Protoss, you know, the exploding Zerglings I absolutely love.
2962986	2963066	Yeah.
2963767	2981646	I don't know enough about the StarCraft universe to even profess to say oh this is a good idea or no but I kind of think like okay kind of going from that wow fanboy perspective of maybe these are more like expansion packs these future releases are kind of like expansion packs in a way but they're also standalone because like
2982026	2983107	and I'll see you next time.
2996431	2996611	Hmm.
2997332	2997492	Yeah.
2997512	2998412	Interesting.
2998533	2999193	Very much so.
2999853	3004357	It's a strange experiment they're trying, and it's getting them a lot of crap.
3004377	3012282	You know, there's a lot of people really pooping on StarCraft 2 because of the whole lack of LAN support, but that's... I hate to say it, I think it's more of a vocal minority than anything else.
3012322	3012923	Yeah.
3012943	3014784	I don't think it's anything to...
3014924	3026672	Yeah, some of the, you know, looking at all the additions of what they made from the original game to the new game, it really makes, you know, each of the races a little more versatile.
3027092	3032475	Because, you know, with the original Zergs, you know, you really only had one option, Zerg Rush.
3032715	3033016	That was it.
3033216	3034377	That was the only way to really...
3035337	3043440	Make a dent into the opposing sides and to really thrive was just Zerg Rush.
3043520	3045040	And that was really your only tactic.
3045460	3061386	With the new additions that they have, like the Explodies, Zerglingo Boom, it makes for a really interesting new way of playing for those people who are just used to one style for, you know...
3062908	3066340	for the individuals like the Protoss, like the Terrans.
3067389	3074131	Well, stepping away a little bit from the gameplay for a minute here to talk numbers again, because I think this is very interesting and could be very telling for the future.
3074911	3088395	Now, again, this report on VGCharts.com is estimating that 31% of those units were sold on Battle.net, meaning that about a third was all digital distribution directly through Battle.net.
3089475	3093776	That could be very, it's almost a telling sign of where GameStop's going to be in 10 years.
3094159	3100288	So do you think games on DVD, CD are going to be obsolete and you just download it in the future?
3100629	3101590	How long do you think it's going to take?
3101610	3102792	Because obviously it is going to happen.
3103183	3106124	Well, have CDs gone obsolete yet?
3106264	3107144	No, not yet.
3107164	3109565	They've had unexpected longevity somehow.
3109885	3113866	They've been punched and kicked and throttled and had their hair pulled.
3113986	3114386	Pretty much.
3114406	3115766	But they're not dead yet.
3116327	3117547	They're not dead yet.
3117647	3119607	CDs are... They're not getting better, though.
3119988	3125489	CDs are kind of where, right now, I think you can kind of look to that to see a little bit about where gaming's going.
3126029	3127250	Here's my parallel.
3127790	3128890	Newspapers and online...
3129270	3134554	Yes, newspaper circulation is down so far, so fast.
3134874	3136295	Newsweek is up for sale.
3136456	3137616	But they're not all dead yet.
3137656	3138657	No, they're not all dead yet.
3138737	3143060	Major dailies are hurting, like the Washington Post, the New York Times, but they're not gone.
3143621	3144982	So we'll see what form they take.
3145042	3148645	The iPad might have something to say about what form they take in the future.
3149425	3150326	We'll see how that goes.
3150406	3152367	Or the Amazon Kindle.
3152387	3153808	The Kindle, yes.
3154269	3156070	And also Sony has another e-reader.
3156110	3156851	I forgot what it was called.
3156871	3158512	Sony's e-reader is actually really, really nice.
3158652	3161195	I have the Kindle app on my iPhone and I absolutely love it.
3161215	3164779	And keep in mind, I'm trying to go into publication for my field when I'm out of school.
3179568	3184411	Thankfully, there's jobs out there for online publication as well as print publications.
3185051	3186252	Besides just blogging.
3186432	3189814	If you know how to do them both, you're in a good place.
3192876	3197799	I've thankfully been printed before.
3198640	3203963	I hate to do this, but I have actually breaking news, a special report we have to go to.
3207332	3207935	Thanks for watching!
3211562	3213843	Live late breaking news, you guys.
3213903	3215624	It's very important.
3215664	3218266	There's just been a post on Facebook.
3218986	3220867	Joshua Hunter was born at 5.14 p.m.
3220907	3224970	So congratulations to Loki.
3225010	3226511	And there was much rejoicing.
3228132	3233355	And I actually think I just saw something in the Orange Lounge from Kitsune.
3233375	3236176	Yeah, that's how I knew to look.
3237177	3239538	Because they're able to refresh a little faster.
3239658	3240439	It's so cute!
3241159	3241740	I know, right?
3242460	3244161	Look at that little one!
3244201	3248904	You know, she couldn't have waited one more hour to have the baby during OLR.
3248924	3250766	Now it's a Bobby Blackwolf baby.
3250906	3252747	I'm sorry, babies wait for no one.
3254088	3255389	I'm sure Nelly's like, get this child out of me.
3260117	3260637	There it is.
3260717	3262999	That's my impression of Nellie in childbirth.
3263319	3265601	The baby kind of looks like Nellie.
3266221	3267602	He does?
3267802	3268202	Yeah.
3268222	3271985	I think he's got, though, you see that turn of his mouth?
3272165	3272445	Yeah.
3272785	3274226	That's totally Loki.
3274266	3275407	Yeah, you can definitely see.
3276188	3277508	I think he's got Nellie's nose.
3278629	3279290	So there you go.
3279750	3280130	All right.
3281151	3284033	Sorry to interrupt the show, but that was definitely worth interrupting the show for.
3284073	3286574	I wonder if they're going to have a brist for him, and then I feel really sorry.
3286594	3287495	Aww.
3288596	3288716	Aww.
3289056	3290998	Final Fantasy VII Victory Dance.
3291038	3291879	Wow, that brings back memories.
3291899	3292159	I know.
3292439	3294582	I should have found that music.
3294882	3295182	All right.
3296043	3299727	Well, any more baby news we get during the show we'll bring to you, okay?
3299747	3300087	Yay.
3300107	3300387	All right.
3300648	3302409	Oh, he's so pretty.
3302489	3303230	And he's got red hair.
3303571	3305653	Well, we're just glad that StarCraft didn't lay an egg.
3306013	3306153	Oh!
3306253	3307635	Ouch.
3308495	3310217	Where's my... Yeah.
3310257	3310818	Too soon.
3311138	3311438	All right.
3313260	3314542	Moving on.
3315523	3316324	Where's my rim shot?
3316484	3316744	Wow.
3316924	3319207	Drew Nami's like, how long before he's eating super bacon?
3319267	3320448	Too soon, you guys.
3320568	3321229	Good God.
3321730	3323231	Be happy for 24 hours.
3323352	3323592	All right.
3325858	3326699	Actdeft has a point there.
3326719	3328781	It's the first OLR baby.
3329421	3332544	I gave a congratulations to his sperm and Nelly's hard work.
3333225	3337688	Loki and Nelly were only dating when this show started.
3337768	3339890	Seriously, who did all the work?
3339950	3340931	I'm not saying you're wrong.
3340971	3341872	I'm not saying you're wrong.
3342312	3343934	I said you got your priorities straight.
3343954	3349058	There's a comedian I like called Henry Cho who's a Korean guy from Tennessee, so he sounds totally Tennessee-y.
3349278	3349678	StarCraft 2
3379116	3379260	Ah...
3380396	3388800	One thing that is supposedly, I guess, coming to StarCraft 2 in the future, I guess it was supposed to be there when it launched, but it didn't make it, is chat rooms.
3389540	3389980	That's right.
3390040	3391801	You were supposed to have chat rooms in StarCraft 2.
3392041	3399684	It's not there yet, but it's going to be added in a later patch, and that is per a forum post from one of the community managers over at Blizzard.
3400164	3406367	The chat room is going to be, quote, based around groups where you will be able to join public channels that are based around your interests.
3406787	3408008	Sounds like it's going to be like AOL.
3409349	3409889	Yay!
3411149	3412210	Is that a good thing?
3412810	3413550	I don't think so.
3414050	3423312	There will be private chat rooms as well if you are so inclined or you could always use real ID if you don't mind your last name being plastered all over the internet.
3423332	3425412	Which is why I use an alias.
3426553	3430974	I tried but Blizzard just kind of took it right off my credit card and was like, oh hey, this must be your name.
3434494	3436655	Anyhow, that's in the future for StarCraft 2.
3436695	3437815	DarkSakura, what do you got for us?
3438342	3438802	Baby.
3439683	3441543	He's obsessed.
3441903	3442644	Thank you, everybody.
3442664	3443544	We'll see you next week.
3443864	3445665	No, no, no, no, no, no.
3446825	3449606	Because the biological bomb started ticking really hardcore.
3449906	3450166	Anyway.
3451667	3453207	Did you feel a Twitter in your... Twitter.
3454368	3456028	Did you feel a Twitter in your uterus?
3456909	3459750	Well, I was actually thinking of Kathy Griffin, so was it a Twitter in the twat?
3461792	3462473	Oh, too soon.
3463033	3463273	Ouch.
3463593	3464774	Where is that rim shot?
3465715	3466815	Rob's got the sad trombone.
3467556	3467936	No, no, no.
3468076	3468636	I got it right here.
3468796	3471978	What, keep going?
3473059	3489148	Anyway, remember we were talking a while back about the R4 being banned, being that that's the little memory card reader thing for the Nintendo DS so that you could play ROMs or copies of games or bootleg games.
3489688	3518761	um so there has well I've got a ninja pass so I'm going to talk but anyway um I really got it for though all my imports it's not mine officer I swear but anyway anyway um they actually um there's been a released uh you know they were banned in the UK and now there's a bit more information that's put out about it they basically said that it was actually related to a number of different devices that were sold by Playable's
3519681	3524025	which is the company that they banned was Playables Limited.
3525626	3534913	The devices are defined, and this is a quote, enabled Nintendo DS users to play unlawful copies of Nintendo DS games with which they have downloaded using the internet.
3534993	3538636	That's what Nintendo means about game copiers.
3539896	3552742	But the things that really make it illegal, and this is actually on the list are the R4DS, M3DS, DS1 Supercard, DSTT, DS Linker, Ace Card, CycloDS, Evolution, N5, and EZ Devices.
3553002	3553942	You didn't mention the Ninja Pass.
3553962	3554903	So all the fun stuff.
3555023	3556543	They didn't mention the Ninja Pass, so I'm cool.
3556643	3558064	Yeah, they always make the good stuff illegal.
3558704	3583941	but all of these are ones that use the micro SD flashcard and the argument though basically Nintendo's claim was that it was in violation of the Copyright Designs and Patents Act of 1998 in the UK and the argument that Playables put up was basically that it was to play homebrew games
3584815	3599177	you know, but basically the whole big thing is that the device circumvents Nintendo's machine you know, any of the programming built into it that's there on purpose um
3601428	3618383	And so basically, all of these things, the different encryptions, different things that Nintendo built into the hardware to protect from being able to use bootlegs and whatnot, the device is supposed to counteract them, so that's a big thing that Nintendo's got a bug up their butt about.
3620884	3648137	and according to Nintendo they've seized more than 165,000 game copiers that were intended for playables and so basically they're just you know that was the whole deal about it that even though yeah there's a bunch of other cool things you can do with them the whole bless you the whole big thing has to do with circumventing their hard work
3650389	3654793	I get that and all, but doesn't this seem a little throwing out the baby with the bathwater to you?
3655473	3656194	No pun intended.
3656934	3666563	Because this is where they're saying that since you can use this device to pirate games, it shouldn't be out there on the market.
3666623	3668664	But I can use my computer to pirate games.
3668704	3670066	Does that mean my computer should be banned?
3670086	3670126	No.
3671949	3674410	I mean, it's more about what you use it for.
3674470	3677691	And you know, the good thing about the R4 is that it does open it up to homebrew.
3678331	3680532	Now, of course, I can see both sides of it.
3680832	3687295	There's a lot of people that can sit there and go, okay, you know damn well there's plenty of people that buy those R4s that aren't using it for homebrew.
3687335	3689016	They are using it for the malicious purpose.
3689356	3689876	So it's tough.
3689916	3691116	It's like, where do you draw the line?
3691797	3692157	I don't know.
3693777	3699460	So... That's a tough call because, you know, it's... With the gaming community, you know...
3701312	3719619	That kind of stuff is really, you know, it's hard to call because, you know, you got the regular, you know, honest gamers who actually buy their stuff and, you know, they don't get, you know, access to this because, you know, just a bunch of people decided, oh, we're gonna steal games.
3720559	3727286	It's not fair to both the legitimate players as well as the guys who are doing the stuff.
3727686	3728888	Either way, it's a bad deal.
3729809	3743022	You see, if Nintendo would open up the DS to homebrew, not that I see them ever doing that, but if they were to do something like that, this cart wouldn't really have a lot of leg to stand on because its only purpose would be for something shady.
3744222	3744683	I get it.
3744883	3749926	Nintendo doesn't want to open that up because then there's going to be all sorts of scary homebrew things.
3750006	3755229	Well, there would be homebrew to play Sony PS1 games on your DS or something like that.
3755249	3755729	You know what I mean?
3755970	3757831	Which would just be horrible.
3757931	3760192	I know, right?
3760332	3765275	How many people originally bought a PSP to play the NES emulator that was out at the time?
3765996	3766756	I didn't buy one.
3767797	3769098	And that's another thing.
3769278	3772960	Games that strictly come out for the PSP like Dissidia
3773280	3773400	Yay!
3773420	3773560	Yay!
3773620	3773981	Yay!
3795454	3796355	It's just ridiculous.
3796975	3801359	So it's part of the reason why I didn't play Kingdom Hearts Chain of Memories is because I didn't own a DS.
3801379	3807583	Yeah, but at the same time, emulators, especially to play current games, are super duper illegal and just as bad as what they're banning.
3807943	3811906	I mean, at least know what it is.
3811966	3816709	At least with the R4 and those devices, they are contingent on you having the system.
3818631	3818811	True.
3819271	3819431	Yeah.
3820132	3820332	Yeah.
3820785	3822708	Was there more you wanted to say there, Jamie?
3823028	3834283	No, it was just quoting other cases in Europe that had to do with reel-to-reel tape copiers, but said that this was far worse because it did actually go right on the edge of copyright infringement.
3834793	3841579	All right, well, look, if you want something for free, here's something new that's going to be for free that doesn't involve questionable legality things.
3841599	3842921	This is a totally legit thing.
3843601	3846424	EverQuest 2 is soon going to have a free model.
3846604	3846804	What?
3847125	3850488	Yeah, EverQuest 2 is getting EverQuest 2 Extended.
3850888	3851809	Now, here's the thing, though.
3851849	3855913	This is not like when Lords of the Rings opened up.
3856093	3857615	No, D&D opened up to free-to-play.
3857635	3857875	Mm-hmm.
3858135	3858795	DDO Opened Up and Went Free
3880442	3882044	EverQuest 2 Extended
3900161	3903102	It's interesting because they show all these different types of plans.
3903442	3905663	You can get a free plan for bronze.
3905803	3907164	What they call the bronze level is free.
3907444	3916287	There's a silver plan that's a $10 one-time purchase that gets you more character slots, more spells opened up, you get more bag slots and so forth, more...
3921789	3922429	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
3946878	3947779	Interesting tactic.
3948019	3955504	I don't know if there'll be a lot of platinum and gold players on there, because I think they would be all in regular EverQuest, but I bet you'll get a lot of bronze and maybe even some silvers.
3955904	3958726	And that isn't going to cross over with the regular EverQuest, too.
3958826	3960247	That's going to be its own separate thing.
3960727	3961848	That's what they're saying now.
3962208	3967472	But my curiosity is, well, then what if one population starts to really off-balance the other?
3967572	3969653	Is there a possibility they might merge them later on?
3970373	3996144	I was reading on this thing about if you've already got an existing subscription for EverQuest then you basically get a gold account okay that's what I figured is that if you're already paying them 15 bucks a month that's probably what the regular ones are paying them interesting though that not only have they launched and maybe this is the unreported part of the story is that not only have they launched a free but they've also launched a pay us more version with that platinum tier
3996864	3999945	is it more expensive than the regular games monthly subscription?
3999965	4015111	I think the regular games monthly is the same as that gold $15 a month at least that's like the average MMO subscription but $200 a year I mean that's not as terrible as it sounds because you have to divide $200 by 12 so it's about what maybe $18 a month so it's not terrible
4016731	4036581	um you know how you were saying with the the going to free to play um I when I actually had the power on my computer to do it um I used to play this game uh Cartoon Network's Fusion Fall don't knock it till you tried it um it's we're big fans of uh um robot unicorn attack here so yeah
4036801	4052088	Yeah, so the Cartoon Network Universe MMO, originally when it first came out, you would have the future levels, which was like about five sections of the world and a couple of quests and things like that.
4052128	4057891	And then in order to go to the past was a whole new world, was a totally expanded world.
4058692	4060893	And that was like 15 a month.
4061633	4065155	And now I think it was back in April, they went completely free to play.
4066136	4084795	and they literally skyrocketed their membership because it finally went free to play because a lot of us who really enjoyed the game were pissed that most of the game cost you money because me being a poor gamer.
4086076	4088699	I am totally against paying any sort of money for a game.
4089520	4090180	Okay, within $10.
4090220	4094624	Well, there's a lot of people listening that are probably in the same boat you are.
4095145	4102612	But there's a shout-out coming here from Giovedea in our chatroom at chat.orangelandredi.com Fusion Fall is amazing.
4103213	4107497	VidPower in our chatroom says those old Cartoon Network Toonami Flash games were great.
4107897	4109799	DarkTetsuya is saying Adult Swim needs an MMO.
4110820	4139601	yeah, well, FusionFall is close enough to an Adult Swim MMO because the graphics of the game really remind me of this wonderful artist called Bleedman who's on DeviantArt and look him up, he's awesome it's like making the cartoony, you know like Dexter, not so cartoony, like he actually has a body and hands and arms what a concept so very cool DarkSakura, what do you got next for us?
4140236	4144599	Well, we have some other stuff for fans of Force Unleashed.
4145079	4150723	Well, Force Unleashed 2 has been in development, except the executive producer quit.
4151463	4151844	Oh, no.
4153144	4159989	Hayden Blackman resigned from LucasArts after being with them for 13 years, and he just said it was time to go.
4161470	4163911	He was like, I am not putting Jar Jar Binks in my game.
4164252	4164592	F you.
4164612	4164712	F you.
4165427	4193652	well as a quote while the decision to leave LucasArts did not happen overnight or come easily I really feel that now is the best time for me to move on and explore new creative challenges and look forward to the next phase of my career meaning god I hate this place I want to quit I know like totally reading through the lines there's huge drama that went down that you're never going to know about and LucasArts is saying that his departure is not going to affect the game's development at all yeah
4193937	4195558	Oh no, it won't affect quality at all.
4196118	4196278	No.
4196939	4197679	Well, you never know.
4197719	4200460	I mean, I know we're sitting here kind of poking fun, but it could get better.
4200640	4201041	Who knows?
4201361	4203702	And of course, you know, LucasArts left the dry.
4204182	4210345	We are extremely grateful for his many contributions, fully support him in his new endeavors, and wish him all the best in the future.
4210646	4217209	Because we're a company in California, and you're not allowed to say really anything bad about your previous employees, including the reasons why they left.
4219212	4229311	by the way, I had a friend that worked at LucasArts and she totally got me in the Skywalker Ranch didn't you have George Lucas walk right by and you said something about you wanted to fling your sandwich at him?
4229491	4231916	I was in meatless flicking distance of George Lucas
4232898	4234019	I've heard this story on the show before.
4234039	4234779	I wanted my money back.
4234959	4236420	Thank God for your self-restraint.
4237460	4238120	What a concept.
4265133	4281160	I think one of the new things people will be excited about too is how we're going to be able to penalize people who are habitually quitting out of games, which isn't exactly cheating, but it creates a really negative experience for everybody else in the game.
4281519	4282980	So they're going to penalize rage quitting?
4283200	4283400	Yes.
4283580	4283901	Nice.
4284801	4292226	We actually have new tools now to detect that, and eventually people who do this habitually will actually be penalized.
4292747	4299111	We want to be able to remove them from the population so they can't make everyone else keep having a bad time.
4299671	4311359	Now, of course, they don't elaborate on what exactly they're doing, but doesn't that sound to me like if you rage quit too much, you're going to get banished to Rage Quit Island, where you will play with nothing but other rage quitters?
4311759	4312861	and not be allowed to rage quit.
4313942	4315665	That sounds kind of amazing actually.
4316069	4317370	They should make them do Battle Royale.
4317650	4318151	For real.
4319052	4323395	But at the same time, okay, they say they're going to be able to tell the difference between a rage quit and a disconnect.
4323415	4324196	Well, let me tell you this.
4324236	4328019	In Final Fantasy XI, my version of rage quit was to go turn off the cable modem.
4328700	4335145	So how would they know that that was... How did they know that that's me rage quitting and not a disconnect?
4335225	4343853	Like, you know, I get backing out of a match and all that or quitting or whatever, but how do they know the difference between that and a legitimate drop of the connection?
4344113	4346234	Well, you know those wonderful ninja mods.
4346614	4347555	You never know where they are.
4348655	4350516	Maybe it could be the timing of it, too.
4350556	4358380	Like, if you are habitually always quitting when certain circumstances met, then that's when you get banished to Rage Quit Island or something.
4358420	4367864	Like, if you're down and you always seem to lose your connection one minute before the match is over, you're probably going to get targeted for exile, is my thought.
4368243	4368784	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4383403	4383943	Um, let's see.
4384063	4388046	Tigerclaw says maybe someone with high pings lagging out and disconnecting.
4388186	4391787	Ah, maybe kind of seeing like, oh, the pings suddenly get slower and slower.
4391848	4396350	That's a legitimate disconnect where somebody who just had a really good connection and suddenly, oh, it's gone.
4396830	4397530	Maybe a little less.
4397891	4400832	I'd be very curious to see how this all plays out.
4401533	4402653	Mm-hmm.
4402853	4403694	How they're going to treat that.
4403714	4409437	But I love the idea of making all the rage quitters play together on their own little island where they can all rage quit and, you know...
4410157	4410537	Go F themselves.
4410557	4412579	It's like trapping a bunch of trolls on a single island.
4412599	4414040	Exactly.
4414160	4421184	I love the idea of Xbox Live being like the continent of awesome people and then trolls banished to their own island.
4421244	4421885	Sounds great to me.
4421905	4424746	If they're trolls they need to be banished to their own bridge.
4425847	4426548	To go live under?
4426888	4428709	As long as the bridge doesn't connect to anything.
4428829	4429890	Sure, I'm all for that.
4431243	4431463	DarkSakura
4445718	4448100	My hand is broken!
4448360	4449361	Use your good hand.
4450622	4451423	God gave you two.
4451743	4452944	I need to go take some more Vicodin.
4454345	4456887	Well, anyway, Valve made a whoops.
4458008	4464714	They banned 12,000 legitimate Modern Warfare 2 players.
4466035	4473021	Basically, the software that's in Steamworks to get the cheaters
4474141	4481843	went on an extermination rampage and banned 12,000 players over the last two weeks.
4483023	4497027	Basically what happened is that, and this is a quote from the email that was sent out by Gabe Newell, who's the Valve president, the problem was that Steam would fail a signature check between the disk version of a DLL and a latent memory version.
4498347	4501869	So, basically, they said, you know, our bad, sorry.
4502229	4502570	Whoops.
4503150	4504191	I like that he used angst.
4504271	4506672	I apologize for any frustration or angst that may have caused you.
4507513	4510056	Can you all turn your caps lock off now?
4510316	4510777	I know, right?
4511377	4522588	So he's also promised a giftable copy of Left 4 Dead 2 to all of those affected, as well as a copy for themselves.
4523449	4528053	So if I get accidentally banned from a Steam game, I'm going to get two free copies of a game.
4528974	4529755	One is giftable.
4530365	4532787	Right, that's basically two free copies, right?
4532867	4534568	One for you and one for someone you really like.
4534728	4538450	Yeah, so hey, any of you that's been affected by this, gimme!
4539711	4540071	Right?
4540131	4541292	That's kind of where I'm at, too.
4541332	4544474	I'm like, you know, I have Left 4 Dead 1, but not 2.
4545194	4559022	Well, I think why they're giving Left 4 Dead 2 out is because, you know, when you get banned from a game like Modern Warfare 2, you know, the only compensation you can get is to go around killing a bunch of zombies is compensation, you know?
4559363	4559823	Yeah.
4559983	4561883	It's a fair trade.
4562083	4563264	Playing a big hairy biker.
4563644	4564104	Exactly.
4564324	4571065	Besides the also obvious part that it's also their game, you know, it is Valve's game, it's kind of one that they can give away.
4571585	4581027	It actually is kind of impressive that they instead didn't go, oh, well, whoops, we'll give you a copy of, what's cheaper, Left 4 Dead 1, you know, or something.
4581427	4582848	Magical Unicorn Fart.
4582988	4583608	Yeah, exactly.
4583628	4585228	Well, I don't think that was a Valve game.
4586388	4588209	You can have a free copy of Alien Swarm.
4589029	4589149	Ooh.
4591555	4598175	Alien Swarm Oh wait, everybody's getting that free So, have we talked already about the wonderfulness that is Portal 2?
4599574	4600515	on this show we have.
4600855	4604559	Did you watch all the tech demonstrations?
4605660	4606241	I know, right?
4607202	4608363	I love the slippery thing.
4609064	4609564	The what?
4609865	4610665	The slippery goo?
4610966	4611727	Yes, the goo.
4612007	4612447	I love the goo.
4612467	4613168	And the bouncy goo?
4613509	4614129	I love the bouncy goo.
4614390	4615310	That was so great.
4615531	4619535	I was very much pleased with the entire concept of Portal.
4622038	4625242	The fact that they changed the... Oh, and I died.
4625462	4626603	Oh well.
4626643	4627665	Are you still playing RuneScape?
4627685	4628946	Yes, I'm still playing RuneScape.
4629066	4629988	The zombie just killed me.
4630028	4632531	You're worse than Loki in Magic Robot Unicorn.
4632671	4633892	He plays Magic Robot Unicorn.
4633932	4635514	He denies that he does it too, but he does.
4637132	4645358	But yeah, the only grief I kind of have is the fact that they're theoretically using the same protagonist, but she looks nothing like the original game.
4645978	4646859	Did they put a picture of her?
4647920	4648320	Of Chell?
4648600	4650442	They did, but they didn't.
4650622	4652523	I haven't seen the picture of her.
4652864	4657127	Well, I saw the one that was in Game Informer, the different one they had.
4657147	4662251	Well, you know she's also supposed to be, the actual person is supposed to be showing up in Half-Life 3.
4662911	4666154	We also might have set off an LOL, Accidental False Alarm, in chat.
4666454	4668135	Thamster says, wait, is that out now?
4668356	4669316	No, no, no, no, it's not.
4669396	4671058	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
4671098	4671778	Not until 2011.
4671858	4672459	No, no, no.
4673300	4673560	Nope.
4673940	4676382	But there are some sexy demos on YouTube if you want to go check it out.
4676602	4677423	Oh, yes.
4677443	4681086	Let's go to release dates, travel around the world, and talk about games that are going to be coming out.
4681446	4684547	Portal 2 will not be on the list this week, but maybe some other stuff.
4684967	4686327	So I'm going to start with the U.S.
4686367	4686627	tonight.
4686647	4689128	We're going to shake things up a little bit because obviously Loki's not here.
4689148	4689928	So I'm going to cover U.S.
4689968	4693289	tonight and pronounce things correctly for once, I hope.
4693869	4695930	Monster Rancher DS is out this week.
4696010	4698210	It's going to cost you $30 if you want that on the DS.
4698790	4700191	Sing it, family hits.
4700691	4707472	That's right, because you know you want to sing songs from Beauty and the Beast and The Little Mermaid, all from Disney, coming out on the PlayStation 3 and the Wii this week.
4710373	4711495	You know what's interesting though?
4712216	4713637	The PS3 one is cheaper.
4713838	4715480	Oh, because the Wii one comes with a mic.
4715660	4717282	I get it.
4717362	4720446	Gary, I know this is going to be the one that gets you back into console games.
4720466	4720767	You ready?
4721167	4722269	Dora the Explorer.
4722349	4724291	Dora's Big Birthday Adventure on the DS.
4724512	4725393	Oh, whatever.
4725413	4725793	30 bucks.
4727255	4728235	Oh no.
4728295	4730437	If I were to get another console, I'd get a PS3.
4731778	4735520	Junior Classic Books and Fairy Tales, $20 on the Nintendo DS.
4735540	4741285	This is basically, you're paying for $130 that are pretty much in the public domain, or were really cheap to license.
4741365	4742946	But if you want that, hey, have fun with it.
4743546	4748590	So, quite a barrage of some more wireless controllers and accessories also out this week.
4749270	4752733	And I think we might have hit on most of the games...
4753473	4756394	I think it's kind of a slow week in game release world.
4756434	4758455	I'm trying to see if there's anything else this week.
4759576	4762957	They got anything good in the budget bin?
4763617	4765818	Well, this new game on the Xbox 360 is only $30.
4766638	4769620	It's a role-playing game, and for an Xbox 360 game, that's something.
4770020	4772621	It's Agarest War, and it comes out on the 5th.
4773490	4775032	Record of Argorist War
4799094	4799974	That's all I have for the U.S.
4799994	4800315	this week.
4800635	4801596	Well, like I said, the U.K.
4801616	4802717	is looking pretty bare.
4803037	4805119	Nothing until next week, so I'm going to do Japan.
4805639	4806300	Yay!
4806440	4808902	Sorry to take your pronunciation away from you, Rob.
4810283	4810864	It's really fine.
4811064	4813486	Put all that anime pronunciation skill to the test.
4814252	4819157	Well, we've got a few things that don't really particularly have a date on it, but they're for PC and Mac.
4819177	4827185	We have Arma 2, Operation Arrowhead, Battle vs. Chess, City of Heroes Going Rogue, Elemental War of Magic, Cannon Lynch 2, Mafia 2.
4828807	4829527	Going to...
4831369	4831969	The PSP.
4833350	4838171	There's Assassin's Creed Bloodlines from Ubi the Best, so it's basically re-released.
4838611	4842892	There's Hayarikami 3, which is another re-release.
4842952	4847253	And then Oretachi no Sabage Versus, which is a new game.
4851094	4856157	Also coming out on the Nintendo DS, we have Battle Spirits Digital Starter.
4856337	4858118	And this is a game that I totally want to play.
4858699	4861860	It's Chokowai Hanashi DS Aonosho.
4862561	4865683	Which, it means like super scary stories.
4866783	4867944	It's all ghost tales.
4868364	4868804	That's what they are.
4870165	4874008	And then also we have Heartcatch Precure Oshare Collection.
4874328	4876409	So, there's also Jewel Pet.
4876749	4879251	Mahono Oheade Isho ni Aboso.
4880171	4880531	No, sorry.
4881752	4882292	Asobo.
4882413	4883313	Sorry, I said that wrong.
4883353	4883994	Asobo.
4884134	4884494	Asobo.
4884614	4884934	Oh, good.
4884954	4885595	It's not just me.
4886335	4887416	Well, you know, I just read too fast.
4887876	4889977	And then we have Mame Goma Kawaii Gaipai.
4889997	4892599	Oh, no, I'm thinking opai.
4892659	4893340	Opai means boobs.
4894440	4896942	Tetris Party Premium also on August 5th.
4897202	4898802	Wait, there's a game about boobs coming out?
4898862	4902803	No, it's Ippai, and I thought I was thinking Oppai, which is boobs.
4904023	4914525	PlayStation 2, we have J-League winning 11 2010 Club Championship, and Persona 3 FES, which is a PlayStation the best to re-release.
4914866	4917086	Persona 4, also PlayStation 2 the best.
4917886	4921607	And then Shin Sango Musou 4 Empires, which is also a re-release.
4922187	4924347	Of course, Madden NFL 11 is also on the list.
4925108	4926348	The Persona games were really good.
4926368	4926928	I really liked them.
4927048	4932855	Believe it or not, we have sports fans that listen to the show who want their roster update for the year, just like DDR fans want their song list.
4932875	4934998	But I'm wondering who in Japan likes American football.
4935018	4939363	Anyway, on the way, we have Tetris Party Premium and Twinkle Queen.
4940084	4941385	Also, Arcade Shooter.
4941405	4942266	Twinkle Queen?
4942426	4942987	Twinkle Queen.
4943027	4943688	Let me look this up.
4943928	4945969	I think I met a drag queen like that once
4960543	4961624	Been there, done that.
4961704	4964326	How many all-chick fighting games have we seen at this point?
4965807	4967788	They are not going to sleep with you when you beat the game.
4968628	4976033	A few undated things that I just think is funny is Gunblade New York and LA Machine Guns Arcade Pack, which I would totally get.
4976493	4977094	Love you, Sega.
4978615	4980276	Cold Gym Dance Workout.
4981657	4982197	What?
4982717	4983238	I know, right?
4983678	4986220	And Lucha Libre AAA Heroes Del Ring.
4988566	4990735	That was the one they were plugging at E3.
4991116	4992341	And Disney Guilty Party.
4994382	4997063	I know what game that is, but that's just a funny way of phrasing it.
4997083	4997703	I love the name.
4997743	4999123	Disney Guilty Party?
4999183	5000844	Who's guilty of stealing the cookies?
5000864	5001664	Is that like Clue?
5002404	5003324	It kind is.
5003344	5004224	It's like a whodunit game.
5004244	5005205	Disney characters?
5005805	5008105	It's like an original Disney game.
5008145	5010926	It's not like Ariel and Beauty and the Beast and stuff.
5011526	5018828	The only Disney game that I'm actually looking forward to that they were plugging in E3 really, really bad was Epic Mickey.
5019088	5019928	That looks amazing.
5020248	5033158	Epic Mickey does look epic, but I gotta give a shout-out to Tron, because I don't stand for movies very often, but I will be there day one, Tron 3D, and I'm gonna have the biggest fanboy boner in the galaxy.
5034759	5035780	Gamers unite!
5035800	5037741	Gamers unite!
5037882	5041504	Then you know they're gonna sell so many tie-in games with that, it's gonna be ridiculous.
5041825	5042805	If it's a good movie.
5042825	5044427	God, I hope it's a good movie.
5045367	5045507	Yeah.
5046448	5048471	Anyway, back to the Japanese list.
5048731	5053136	PlayStation 3, Assassin's Creed 2 Special Edition, and Tiger Woods PGA Tour 11.
5054338	5054638	Why?
5055759	5062908	And then finally for Xbox 360, we have Assassin's Creed 2 Special Edition Platinum Collection, and Magna Carta 2, which I know is pretty big.
5063228	5064189	It's a Platinum Collection.
5064750	5065511	And that would be all.
5066091	5066632	That's everything.
5067092	5069834	A lot of those were budget bin games or re-releases, which I really like.
5069874	5071155	Yeah, Magna Carta 2 is a re-release.
5071215	5074278	Yeah, Japan seems to be doing a lot of price reductions this time of year.
5074618	5077620	Don't know what the occasion is, but hey, I'll take any excuse.
5077841	5082644	Yeah, so will I. Somebody's got some serious rage against Mickey on the chat room.
5083565	5084847	That would actually be Drew Nami.
5085307	5089172	Some folks in our chat room are asking, where is, where was it here?
5089212	5090113	I'm going back to our chat room.
5090133	5093897	Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com, and I think the whole Twinkle Queen brought this up.
5094558	5097261	Frisbee's asking, where the fuck is the RuPaul's Drag Race game?
5097621	5098162	I think we should.
5098602	5098742	Exactly.
5098762	5098942	Exactly.
5121612	5123316	I mean, come on, chat room.
5123536	5124739	Which would you rather play?
5125140	5128268	The Bachelor or RuPaul's Drag Race?
5129271	5129631	RuPaul.
5131375	5140598	Look, even you guys who have no interest in drag whatsoever, completely secure in your masculinity and your love of women, I think you would play RuPaul's Drag Race versus The Bachelor.
5141018	5141998	And why do you say this?
5142578	5143499	Because it's awesome!
5143579	5146480	Because The Bachelor is gayer than RuPaul's Drag Race.
5146500	5147180	It really is.
5147460	5148500	I won't argue with that.
5148640	5149200	You know what?
5149381	5150821	Okay, this is my thing.
5152321	5155802	When I see my husband spend hours customizing wrestling characters...
5157904	5158806	Like they're dress-up dolls?
5158846	5159568	It's Barbie, yeah.
5159809	5160691	It's Barbie for men.
5160771	5162395	I was like, yeah, men really like to do this too.
5162856	5164580	Well, wrestling is just soap opera for men.
5165472	5166792	There's nothing wrong with that.
5166832	5168673	Men need their stories told.
5168773	5170753	I loved it.
5171013	5177555	And speaking of the whole rage-quitting thing for Halo, I just rage-created RuneScape because I was sick of dying.
5177575	5179355	I died twice.
5179375	5181716	You're going to get banished to Rage Quit Island.
5181896	5187137	Oh, actually, don't get me started on the fact that I started the game day one in RuneScape.
5187617	5189979	You know, how to fend for myself.
5190379	5192760	Had to learn how to use all my skills on my own.
5193181	5197323	Then about, you know, two years after I started playing, they introduced Noob Island.
5198244	5198444	Oy!
5199425	5199905	Noob Island.
5200085	5202086	They basically show you... There really is a place called Noob Island.
5202206	5202667	Yeah.
5202747	5205609	They basically show you how to get to fifth level.
5206109	5212013	They walk you through it tutorial style on how to craft... Does a little hand come out of the monitor?
5212153	5212493	Exactly.
5212513	5212933	Come with me.
5212973	5216616	It's like that stupid Milo thing they were showing at E3 last year.
5216656	5216836	Yeah.
5217136	5218277	Come with me!
5218437	5220559	They were probably losing too many new people.
5220779	5223641	It reminded me of that annoying paperclip guy on Word.
5224562	5226283	Oh god, it was turning the thing off.
5226403	5228004	I just got a pepper in my wound.
5228405	5233809	Every Word computer I ever log into for the first time, I'm always like, okay, first things first.
5233869	5234709	Launch Word.
5234729	5236050	Right click, disable.
5236491	5238793	Kill the paperclip!
5239053	5241415	Or the wizard, or whatever form it happens to take.
5241455	5243076	That thing is so bloody annoying.
5243479	5245100	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5271756	5279059	Hey, look, I'm all about whatever makes you happy, but at the same time, don't complain about your system being slow when you have Miss Kitty running around chasing yarn.
5280960	5285202	My word for the whole thing is, why?
5285542	5287023	Not a question, just why?
5287423	5291265	Hold on, Dark Tetsuya is making the Project Journey game for OLR, right?
5291585	5295227	Can we have a level where Dark Sakura shoots paper clips?
5295387	5296487	I think that would be appropriate.
5297028	5297248	Okay.
5297853	5299395	She can euthanize Mr. Paperclip.
5299475	5299995	That would be great.
5300756	5301597	Just making that request.
5301617	5302538	That's not gory enough.
5302558	5304200	That guy needs to die horribly.
5304400	5308164	Well, then a paperclip can just attack her hand if she loses.
5308184	5310827	The giant paperclip, but when you shoot him, he bleeds kittens.
5311708	5312388	What?
5312869	5318395	I was thinking just Mr. Paperclip could melt into slag slowly and painfully, but okay, fine.
5321175	5322256	Rob, can I do a story?
5322336	5322816	Yes, you may.
5324217	5325097	Guess what?
5325898	5327879	Disney acquired PlayDom.
5328620	5329420	What does that mean?
5330120	5332262	Well, PlayDom does sorority life, Rob.
5332362	5337405	My favorite Facebook game.
5337505	5343769	I seriously played sorority life religiously for like a month and then I got... Don't judge me!
5345230	5346331	I see you judging him.
5346652	5348674	You totally were just judging me right there.
5348694	5349435	Did you see that look?
5349455	5350716	That was the look of judgment.
5351537	5351817	Chips.
5351957	5352458	That's right.
5353599	5355862	I need to grab the chips because this is just entertaining now.
5357003	5360066	I was playing, look, but do you know why I was playing sorority life?
5360126	5364271	Because there was a dress up your character mode and I was the fiercest diva on the block.
5365777	5366197	I was.
5366638	5367238	I got nothing.
5367258	5368019	I got nothing.
5368219	5372783	And she would beat bitches down with her purse because that's what she did in sorority life.
5373344	5375566	But here's what started frustrating me about sorority life.
5375906	5384134	They implemented, and I cannot believe we are giving this any face time on the show, but I really want to reiterate this week, I don't give a fuck.
5384654	5384954	All right?
5385135	5385335	All right.
5385395	5387036	So anyway, so sorority life.
5387817	5389058	Whatever floats your boat, man.
5389939	5391120	Whatever sinks your battleship.
5391180	5391741	Yes, that too.
5392620	5418949	Sorority Life, yeah, I played it for like a month and I quit finally because I got really irritated that whenever you log in for some reason it would instantly put you up to the top of other people's list of who wants to beat down this bitch and so like I would log in and within three seconds I would be out of energy because I would basically get gang raped by all these blonde bitches the minute I log in so Sorority Life needed to give me at least like two minutes to bank my money or something
5419429	5420150	But I didn't do that.
5420450	5421911	And that's my complaint with sorority life.
5421931	5424892	And I've totally wasted two minutes of your life that you're never going to get back.
5426353	5426994	Can I keep going?
5427114	5427294	Yes.
5427614	5433437	Well, Playdom also has Social City and Market Street.
5433497	5435258	Those are their other kind of big ones.
5435799	5438680	But Disney acquired them.
5440201	5441862	It now has sorority life.
5441902	5444684	So maybe we'll get Princess Sorority Life.
5445549	5446710	Now that would bring me back.
5446890	5447530	I would play that.
5447911	5449052	Okay, just real quick.
5449072	5452974	I would like to see Belle give everyone the smackdown because she's the brainy woman.
5453255	5458678	Tiana being the new girl on the block is not old and aged like Belle so she will beat you all down.
5458698	5462081	And there's Jasmine who probably has her whole... Jasmine will just whine.
5462281	5464843	She'll just, you know, stick her tiger on people.
5467128	5468089	I want to have a tiger!
5468309	5469750	I want to be a princess with a tiger, Rob!
5470070	5470771	Not with a frog.
5471452	5473233	I thought you wanted a princess with a pony.
5473553	5473833	No!
5474054	5474354	Tiger!
5475315	5475855	Or a goat.
5478297	5486583	Yeah, I'm officially decreeing the wah-wah sound to SSJ Matt for a Facebook game, getting FaceTime on the show.
5486683	5487444	Who would have thunk it?
5487504	5488565	Yeah, he gets the wah-wah sound.
5488625	5490406	I see what you did there.
5491327	5493229	I've bitched about how much I hate Farmville.
5494189	5495991	Oh god, don't get me started.
5496846	5500129	I'm playing Hotel City and I actually like it.
5500169	5502492	You say that like it's supposed to make it better.
5502632	5503533	Like it's okay.
5504963	5505383	Alright, anyhow.
5506104	5507605	Hey, now how about a real game?
5508266	5508806	I like this.
5508906	5509627	This is awesome.
5510027	5513310	This game is called, it's an old school game, Pango.
5513970	5519975	Pango was, let me see if I can find some music from Pango because Pango was pretty epic back in the day.
5520355	5526420	It was this game where you would play a penguin and you walked around a maze and you could push ice blocks.
5526440	5527341	It's freaking hard too.
5528102	5529043	But it's a lot of fun.
5529103	5531484	I don't remember what it's inspired by but let's see.
5531525	5531925	Here's a
5535154	5535874	I guess I'm a pango.
5543578	5546559	So yeah, then you push these little ice blocks around and smush the guys in the stage.
5546620	5547200	It's a lot of fun.
5547400	5547760	It's cute.
5548040	5549961	It looks like Pac-Man with a penguin.
5550982	5551962	And there's no dots either.
5552102	5553863	What are those green things trying to chase you?
5554003	5555444	The green things are, I guess, trying to eat you.
5555484	5555784	I don't know.
5557578	5563764	We recognize the music too That became later on I know, I've heard it before What other game was it in?
5563824	5575634	DDR Raver's Choice Oh wow Anyway, that's not the point The point is, it's coming out on the PSP Yay
5576875	5577976	No, wait, no, I take that back.
5578036	5581538	It's actually... I'm sorry, no, this is something completely different.
5581579	5581939	I'm sorry.
5581959	5583740	It looked like a PSP screenshot at first.
5583780	5584981	It's actually an arcade game.
5586062	5589204	It's coming out in arcades in Japan.
5589265	5591186	It's going to be an eight-player version.
5591706	5594328	Eight-player simultaneous penguins running around the screen.
5595309	5596710	No graphical upgrade at all.
5597691	5598412	Of course not!
5598432	5598832	Of course not!
5598852	5599153	Of course not!
5599173	5599673	Of course not!
5624620	5627962	Alright, now, speaking of classic games Wait, wait, speaking of Sega What?
5628202	5641549	I need to enlist the aid of the chatroom because I used to know the name of this game and for the life of me I forgot about it It's a Sega Saturn game that was visual, not visual, it was audio only and you grew seeds with it A.K.A.
5641569	5642690	the game came with a packet of seeds
5644324	5646745	DarkSakura likes to dig through the gaming vault and find a game that she says, Hey!
5674437	5679140	You little children, babies of the world, including the new one born tonight.
5679640	5684163	Listen, babies, you should be schooled on these old games.
5684203	5686565	When I was your age, I played these games.
5687325	5688066	Right, DarkSakura?
5688086	5688826	Right, Rob.
5688846	5689867	You weren't really a baby.
5689907	5692429	You were probably like 15 when this particular game came out.
5692509	5693649	No, I wasn't.
5694070	5694530	How old were you?
5695451	5696331	I would have been 20.
5696771	5697912	Oh, wow.
5698152	5698913	No, no, I take that back.
5698933	5699574	I would have been 19.
5699794	5703016	All right, well, enough talk about what age you would have been.
5703056	5704157	Let's talk about what the game is.
5704197	5705578	What game did you pick for the folks tonight?
5705958	5706779	Guardian Heroes.
5708760	5709501	Guardian Heroes.
5711082	5712103	If you will play the music, please.
5713424	5714404	That's the character select.
5714444	5714605	Let me...
5717208	5718548	I love Saturn music.
5719548	5724549	Anyway, yeah, the game came out on the Sega Saturn in 1996.
5725569	5730430	Actually, it was kind of funny because this came out before it did in Japan.
5730530	5740012	It came out January 25th in America, January 26th in Japan, which I think might have actually, if I'm doing my, no, because then, I'm sorry.
5740252	5745133	I'm trying to think about, you know, across time zones if that would have been right, but no, I think Japan's a day ahead of us.
5745700	5746260	Thanks for watching!
5764785	5768169	There was a sequel that came out in 2004 for the Game Boy Advance.
5768230	5769531	It was Advance Guardian Heroes.
5769611	5776259	But it's sort of an RPG touch to the beat-em-up genre.
5777060	5779863	As you can, those of us in here can tell on Rob's computer.
5779923	5780064	Ooh!
5780544	5781045	Oh, I like it.
5781365	5782025	I very much like it.
5782546	5785348	It's kind of got the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles feel.
5785368	5786730	I was thinking Street Fighter 2.
5787871	5788892	No, it's not a fighting game.
5789152	5789672	It's a beat-em-up.
5789692	5794597	Sort of like how Final Fight and Double Dragon.
5794657	5797660	Except this one has magic and swords.
5797720	5798781	Magic and swords.
5798821	5799902	But there's no blood.
5800582	5807108	Anyway, going forward, it had a versus mode where you could pick up to six different characters individually.
5807308	5808850	and compete with the main characters.
5808890	5814254	You get unlockable monsters, bosses and civilians with a timed battle or to the death.
5815115	5821641	You get experience points during each scene and you can customize your characters with six different attributes.
5821681	5827446	You have strength, vitality, intelligence, mentality, agility and luck.
5828987	5833031	It's actually luck is good for the spell casters.
5833573	5837616	Anyway, there is, of course, the story mode.
5837876	5840378	You can actually take different paths along the story.
5840758	5843520	So you've got different endings, different bosses, different levels.
5844080	5848563	I mean, basically it has a ton of replayability just because you can really keep going.
5848823	5851625	In fact, this is one thing that I know my husband loves about this.
5852966	5856148	There's a path that will lead to gold and silver from Gunstar Heroes.
5857689	5858429	So that's pretty cool.
5858610	5860271	And keep in mind, this was put up by Treasure.
5861417	5863280	So it gets the, oh my god, Treshar!
5863740	5865863	Award too.
5867285	5875716	And, of course, the gold and silver as the final boss uses the gem power like he did against our heroes.
5876857	5882881	Um, you really can, um, it has multiple levels in the game.
5883341	5886683	You usually only have three planes of battle, the four, the mid, and the back.
5887403	5889565	Um, and you can switch them out in sequence.
5890445	5890785	Um, and...
5892066	5894828	There's also the shoulder buttons that make you move back and forth.
5895388	5897369	You also have evasive moves.
5898249	5904212	And you also have, like, if you get surrounded, you can change your planes.
5904893	5906914	You can move to the foreground or background and whatnot.
5907774	5908455	So that's pretty cool.
5909815	5916619	With the games, you have Samuel Han, who is just a physical powerhouse type of guy.
5916639	5917980	You have Randy M. Green.
5919000	5921321	Who has some spells.
5922861	5923942	Their elemental magic.
5924542	5929083	Ginjiro Ibushi, who is more moving attacks.
5930164	5932504	Nicole Neal, who has different magic.
5933025	5937526	And Serena Corsair, who's supposed to be just a knight.
5937666	5938707	Pretty well-rounded.
5940487	5942348	So yeah, it's the big game.
5942448	5942568	It's...
5945064	5972158	and also good luck freaking finding it now in Japan it was common as dirt I mean super common in the US not so much because they really didn't release very many copies over here and of course we didn't they released plenty of advanced Guardian Heroes but the Saturn one in the US pretty hard to find and it's got really crappy Americanized artwork on the cover makes me kind of sick
5973298	5976823	But apart from that, though, I mean, it's a pretty damn good game.
5977503	5978625	I'll leave the cover in the chat room.
5979446	5983991	There it is, folks, for the Sega Saturn, your classic game of the week, Guardian Heroes.
5984932	5986835	Kind of a neat little combination there.
5987095	5988517	I like it when genres collide.
5989878	5991240	And on top of that, it's treasure.
5992563	5995604	is there a treasure game you haven't done at this point as a classic game of the week?
5995624	6004726	we haven't done like Chameleon Twist or um so you guys can guess what will be done before well no I might have to eventually do that have I done Silhouette Mirage?
6005387	6013289	I think I have done Silhouette Mirage you have to check the wiki I can't remember there's been over over 125 classic games of the week at this point crazy
6013749	6014009	All right.
6014450	6017152	Anyhow, we're going to go ahead and take a break.
6017392	6018013	I have done it.
6018433	6020575	There is plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio to come.
6020595	6023057	We're going to talk about Microsoft Connect in the next segment.
6023397	6026780	We're going to talk about Silent Hill and a new comic book apparently coming out.
6026840	6029802	And yes, believe it or not, more Facebook games.
6029902	6031644	We have to talk about Zynga tonight.
6031964	6032424	I know.
6032745	6033145	I know.
6033305	6033986	Don't tune out.
6034006	6034886	I promise you.
6035807	6037008	It's going to be lol-tastic.
6037428	6040951	So we'll be back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
6041011	6041692	Stay tuned.
6047930	6050752	Hello everybody and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.
6050772	6057656	We are taping live on this August 1st of 2010 here at Orange Lounge Radio headquarters live at allgames.com.
6058137	6061119	And today is actually a very special day in OLR history.
6061199	6066662	Loki is not here tonight because his baby boy was just born earlier this evening at about 5 o'clock.
6067303	6070465	Joshua is the boy's name in case you were wondering and you didn't hear earlier in the show.
6071085	6072447	I'm gonna blast Yay
6092605	6093706	I'm having an absolute blast.
6093726	6094427	This is so much fun.
6094547	6095387	Now I know why Drew comes.
6095687	6097008	Well, we're only halfway through.
6097048	6097669	That's the best part.
6097709	6100110	We haven't even gotten to emails or tweets.
6100170	6101391	We got Twitters to get to a little bit.
6101411	6102272	But wait, there's more.
6102292	6102972	Wait, there's more.
6103012	6105314	In fact, you only got about five more minutes to get Twitter topics in.
6105414	6108336	I have not been able to do any plugs on Twitter tonight because I've been so busy.
6108696	6110778	So I don't know if we're going to have anything waiting for us there, but I'll look.
6111238	6112459	We have spam in French.
6113359	6115121	We get spam in French all the time.
6115181	6115481	I know.
6115521	6116822	I was just laughing because I can read it.
6117827	6119388	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6143497	6170241	I guess these are some rumors picked up it was on buy.com but the listing was since pulled I can tell you this though the rumblings around and people that I know and you know I got friends in low places and so forth Orange Lounge Radio wants to tell you guys this is true these are happening but I mean also that's kind of like telling you like rain will eventually fall from the sky next month of course there's going to be limited editions of these huge games shouldn't be a huge surprise
6170641	6173023	Activision hasn't officially announced it yet, but they will.
6173183	6175724	Prestige for $150, Hard Edition for $80.
6176385	6177485	Couldn't tell you what's in those.
6178446	6183529	Although we're hearing possibly something about maybe a little car.
6185518	6187159	I don't know, take that with what you will.
6188379	6190160	This is one that Activision will talk about.
6190220	6193121	It is DJ Tiesto is actually joining DJ Hero 2.
6193941	6198823	He's actually going to be in the game as a playable character and he's going to be doing two new mixes in the game.
6198943	6200424	I think that's kind of rad.
6200564	6207327	No news yet as to exactly what he's doing, but there was a little video that was released.
6207767	6209788	So I'm not sure what this video shows us.
6209848	6213049	I think it just shows him in game and it might be like playing one of his mixes here.
6213909	6216170	But they did release a little clip here from DJ Hero 2.
6219152	6220833	I'm trying to get a little more of it here in studio.
6221013	6223894	The first one was really awesome.
6224014	6226215	Oh, I love DJ Hero 1.
6226436	6227016	I'm a DJ.
6230137	6231758	I play for so many people.
6232058	6233739	I'm very lucky that I have that opportunity.
6233759	6234940	Nah, I don't want to hear the whole interview.
6234980	6236921	I was hoping to hear more of his music.
6236941	6238762	Being part of the DJ Hero game is...
6239515	6240916	He'll be in DJ Hero, hooray for him.
6241396	6244098	Also, Kmart.
6244138	6247541	Wow, this is like three shows in a row we've actually had a Kmart story.
6247641	6248641	I don't get this.
6249102	6250483	When did Kmart become relevant?
6250663	6251363	I don't understand.
6251463	6252484	This is so weird.
6252864	6258728	They've done the whole rebranding thing, so perhaps... Well, they're really trying to appeal to the gamers, and this is a pretty big one.
6258748	6260390	This is a great way to appeal to gamers.
6260790	6261911	Sell stuff cheap.
6262671	6266115	The Wii console, down to $179.99 this week.
6266295	6267256	What?
6267376	6268677	A whole $20 off.
6269178	6272301	But hey, that's 10% of the cost, so hard to complain about that.
6272882	6276666	By the way, the deal runs out tomorrow, so you better hurry up and get on that.
6276986	6277907	Aw, damn.
6277967	6279249	Came right around the corner from my house.
6279349	6282172	Both the white and the black Wiis, just so you know.
6282856	6284438	I have no money, no!
6284458	6286661	Well, how about some other stuff?
6286801	6287342	How about it?
6288163	6289345	This makes me particularly happy.
6289425	6292769	In Rock Band, we have Blondie.
6292989	6294111	Yay!
6294471	6298056	There's already a little Blondie in there, but I'm never going to say no to more Blondie.
6298897	6302159	and also a group that I like, Family Force 5.
6304001	6314208	So actually, with this upcoming pack that's going to be out on August 3rd, we have Rapture for Blondie, Jesus Freak DC Talk, whatever, The Perfect Crime No.
6314228	6326397	2, The Decemberists, I Only Want You, Eagles of Death Metal, Saturday Morning Eels, Love Addict Family Force 5, Sturm und Drang, KMFDM, and Bulletproof LaRue.
6328442	6329804	Shut up, what, in Rock Band?
6329984	6330204	Mm-hmm.
6330325	6331446	We're getting Bulletproof?
6331847	6332067	Yeah.
6332127	6334810	I love that song, even though it's like way overplayed on the radio right now.
6334830	6335171	Yay!
6335231	6336853	I loved it like nine months ago.
6337994	6338255	Awesome.
6338315	6339937	I'm getting DC Talk, that's funny.
6341630	6342210	Oh, come on.
6342571	6343691	Let's give them a break.
6343992	6351016	Also, ESRB has Fatal Labyrinth, which was a Sega Genesis game.
6352377	6362583	It's supposed to be set up on the PC downloads, but it's also going to be available for Wii for the Virtual Console and Mac, PS3, Xbox 360.
6364614	6366555	It's in the Genesis collection thingy.
6366575	6367536	Don't bother.
6367756	6369297	In the Sonic Ultimate Genesis collection.
6369357	6371158	I mean, get the Sonic collection.
6371198	6375501	It's great, but don't bother with a $5 standalone release when you can get that collection for $20.
6375561	6376001	It's great.
6376641	6378422	And you get tons of stuff right now.
6378442	6379703	Sometimes it is worth it to pay more.
6379843	6381084	And that game kind of blows.
6381424	6388148	I mean, I hate to say it, but it's kind of like somebody decided to port... I don't know if you guys know Rogue, the old-ass game from years and years ago.
6388428	6391770	Somebody decided to port Rogue to the Sega Genesis, and that's kind of what you got.
6392210	6393031	And Rogue is more fun.
6394577	6415429	Well, um, now also in other news, um, there is a mandatory update for, um, PS3 FromWorth, uh, 3.41 So, um, it's gonna add in a You May Like section to the PlayStation Store And, really, that's about it There's nothing else But it's mandatory!
6415629	6420972	That's like how Twitter now shows me people I ought to be following I don't give a crap Anyway
6421969	6424354	I know, I'm like, a lot of these people I'm not following for a reason.
6424615	6425156	Just so you know.
6426639	6431510	Alright, let's go to Twitter topics and visit the tweeter and see who's sending us messages.
6433789	6434410	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6453192	6472909	and this is definitely one that I think is interesting that we did overlook and it comes from the International Business Times that he's actually linking us to China is actually pushing a real name system for online games and that starts today, August 1st you're going to have to register using your real name if you want to play an online game this is like real ID gone wrong, really wrong
6473870	6475251	That comes from the Ministry of Culture.
6475311	6476992	It was announced on June 22nd.
6477512	6485516	And it's part of a nationwide campaign to improve management of the virtual gaming industry and protect the minor from unwholesome content.
6486280	6488981	Well, you do realize this is China, right?
6489001	6489962	Yeah, I know, I know, it's different.
6490002	6491662	It's obviously a lot different than Real ID.
6491963	6498946	Well, they have some serious issues with people not managing their time well on these MMOs, right?
6499546	6500366	So, I don't know.
6500406	6507530	I mean, but then again, we have some people with issues not managing their time well in America as well, so it just seems to be a lot worse.
6507590	6509531	Some of the stories you hear are really, really scary over there.
6509551	6511352	I don't know what they're talking about, Shifty Eye, Shifty Eye.
6513093	6518281	But anyhow, how would you like it if they stepped in and said, hey, everybody's going to have to play online games with their real name.
6518341	6519062	Do not want.
6519763	6520524	Do not want.
6520644	6521465	Good luck with that, China.
6522133	6525936	All right, next up, though, speaking of China, how about Chinatown?
6526557	6529979	Matt, SJ100Matt on Twitter actually wanted to link us to this.
6530019	6532882	He kind of wanted to give a shout-out to one of his local arcades.
6532902	6537966	I've heard of this place, but I've never been, and he was very proud that Kotaku had featured it this week.
6538006	6542630	As you know, they're one of the big boy gaming blogs, and so they feature stuff once in a while.
6543290	6570753	and they are talking about the Chinatown Fair Video Arcade it is located on Mott Street in New York City's Chinatown apparently it is also this environment that LGBT youth can just kind of be themselves yeah I read about that kind of interesting that it's gaming and LGBT colliding although I thought it was really cool when I went to that place in Portland they had like an LGBT night once a month which I thought was kind of fun all the gay gamers can get together
6572114	6574857	I really feel they need to include the asexual in that list too.
6577120	6582466	Well, there's a big old long string of alphabet soup, but at some point it gets too big.
6582686	6583146	You know what I mean?
6583907	6584288	But anyway.
6585061	6585842	www.DarkSakura.com
6605772	6609417	So it just sounds like this hodgepodge of just go play and have fun.
6609697	6611579	That's what video games should be about anyway.
6611599	6617787	It shouldn't even be about LGBT or Rayvars or Otaku or whatever.
6617807	6619008	It should just be about just have fun.
6619689	6620230	Don't be a dick.
6621693	6622714	Yeah, exactly.
6623095	6624236	We got enough clicks in the real world.
6624676	6626218	Always remember rule one.
6626599	6627139	Don't be a dick.
6627740	6628240	Exactly.
6628300	6628601	Exactly.
6628621	6629101	Don't be a dick.
6629161	6631464	And don't bring your click into the virtual world.
6632645	6639052	And then lastly, DarkTetsuya on the tweeters wants us to plug his latest retro review for Mega Man on the site.
6639133	6641615	It's actually pretty awesome, so go check that out at OrangeLaunchVideo.com.
6644520	6647563	I don't want to say expose on Mega Man, but it's a nice little retrospective.
6647923	6650345	The original Mega Man games, I remember those very fondly.
6650365	6651085	They were awesome.
6651205	6656610	Oh man, you've got to see some of the new ones, because the new ones invoke the old ones very well.
6656670	6657351	It's very cool.
6658551	6659072	Very, very cool.
6659608	6661609	Alright, let's get back into some other news here.
6661629	6663671	I'm going to start off with a story on Kinect.
6664131	6667093	Kinect, of course, being the motion control device coming out from Microsoft.
6667393	6675458	We announced last week that it was going to be $150, although obviously speculation had run rampant on that for a while.
6676158	6677599	It's coming with Kinect Adventures.
6678099	6680681	And, of course, they got a lot of shit for that.
6681161	6683663	Well, I guess they came out this week.
6683703	6685905	It was the marketing manager, Brett Siddons.
6686105	6688567	He's the marketing manager for Microsoft Connects.
6689107	6691048	He was at an event in the UK for Amazon.
6691108	6694791	He says that Connect is, quote, very competitively priced.
6695291	6698714	Now, since he was in the UK, he was talking about UK pricing, but you know what?
6698734	6700495	It's all the same deal at the end of the day.
6701396	6707720	He's basically saying that the navigation controller is going to be an extra $30 on top of the $100 bundle.
6707800	6707961	Okay.
6709042	6709422	and DJ Ranma S.
6727542	6756470	uh so anyway uh Microsoft is basically trying to say hey if you want two people to have fun you only need one connect whereas with all these other systems you need two of everything and we kind of knew they'd go this way and I think as we talked about last week a little bit it's kind of like well but your console then offsets the price of a Wii and it's really all about the games at the end of the day honestly I mean you can charge plenty for this system as long as you have the games to back it up but if Dance Central is going to be your only good game
6757495	6784920	I don't know if it's worth the time of all the E3 games that I saw for the Kinect the one that I really would love to go over to a friend's house and play because I do not own a 360 god forbid is the Children of Eden looks amazing it does look great it's too bad they didn't have a playable one on the show floor so we don't know enough about it but if you just imagine it's going to be Rez using your body that's cool enough for me
6785185	6787648	Yeah, that just looks absolutely amazing.
6788929	6789910	It'll be great.
6791172	6793014	Alright, DarkSakura, what do you got for us?
6795754	6797675	Well, this is actually pretty cool.
6798476	6808503	Silent Hill 8, the guy who's writing it, Tom Waltz, is also working on a comic book crossover called Silent Hill Past Life.
6809143	6819570	Set in 1867 and is about an outlaw called Jebediah Foster who meets a widow that changes his ways.
6820531	6823152	And they move to Silent Hill to escape the Wild West.
6824433	6827435	Um, but, of course, Silent Hill screws them over.
6829135	6834458	So, but, it's that, um, the game is going to feature a character from the comic.
6834938	6836619	Although the game is in modern times.
6838099	6841681	So, hey, I hope that they do better.
6842741	6845823	The trailer is out, though, for Silent Hill 8, and I really need to sit down and watch it.
6848564	6849925	They showed a little bit at E3.
6850225	6850745	It looked alright.
6852846	6854109	I like that you have to put in your birthday.
6855372	6856034	Because it's not awesome?
6856054	6857938	Well, because it's restricted content, young lady.
6857958	6858339	I know.
6859918	6864141	All right, well, while she's watching that, I have to bring this up.
6864281	6868544	I apologize in advance, but let's all poke a little fun at Zynga this week.
6869125	6871526	Because they did something where they're getting a lot of shit for it.
6871606	6874568	So if you don't like Zynga, you can kind of jump on the bandwagon with this.
6874608	6875089	It'll be fun.
6875369	6875989	Okay, here's the deal.
6876470	6877831	Zynga has this game on Facebook.
6877871	6879091	It's called Street Racing.
6879812	6885856	And they announced, with really no rhyme or reason, that they are shutting the game down tomorrow, August 2nd.
6887257	6888358	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6910376	6910636	DarkSakura.com
6929915	6940220	Well, Zynga came out this week and said, quote, as an acknowledgement of the inconvenience these changes may have caused, we have offered credits to all players who have made a purchase in the last 90 days.
6942761	6943021	All right.
6944502	6953866	So these players will receive a credit for the exact amounts of their purchases, plus an additional 100 units of premium currency in any of Zynga's nine most popular games.
6955242	6958686	So in other words, if you bought stuff, they're not going to refund you.
6958786	6962190	They're just going to let you have credits for other games.
6963592	6965233	What if I don't want those other games?
6968729	6976173	Although we can kind of sit here and kind of point and laugh and ha-ha at Zynga and who bought that shit anyway, it does kind of lead to this scary precedent.
6976933	6983277	For example, right now you can buy things in World of Warcraft, right?
6984137	6988679	And what if in World of Warcraft you buy, I don't know, like a pet?
6988839	6990520	What's going to happen when World of Warcraft goes away?
6990880	6992161	You lose that pet.
6992721	6993182	Which, you know...
6994182	6996063	Duh, you should know that.
6996183	6998244	Games don't last forever and so forth.
6998284	7003866	But it should be something you think about before you get these, you know, untangible items, correct?
7004266	7006367	I think this serves as a little bit of a lesson.
7006747	7009308	If ever this game decides to shut its doors...
7011517	7012218	It's gone.
7038679	7040260	So you don't lose it.
7040701	7041141	You don't lose it.
7041201	7051148	Which, you know, the whole thing that they're shutting it down, you know, it's for no rhyme or reason, nothing.
7052105	7053086	DarkSakura.com
7072142	7076466	Anyhow, let's see, where are we at?
7077627	7092660	Comments in chatroom, chat.orange.com Bonds006 says, but Neopets, PetPet, they live, I hope Neopets is another one of those sites that might go away someday Hitstun, if ever Xbox Live goes offline, you can't play any of the Xbox Live indie games you bought
7093480	7093960	Good point.
7094061	7096882	I mean, original Xbox was just shut down a couple months ago.
7097243	7101205	Does that mean in about five years the Xbox we have now is also going to get shut down?
7101305	7102706	And then all these indie games go wrong?
7103627	7109931	It's kind of funny because a lot of people were giving crap to OnLive, the new service that's out that lets you play games through the streaming service.
7110351	7114414	Like, you're going to buy this game for $50, but it's really only guaranteed to work for three years.
7114594	7116075	Then they might pull the plug on OnLive.
7116735	7121418	Whereas if you go to the store and buy a game for $50, you pretty much have it quote-unquote forever.
7121718	7121858	Mm-hmm.
7123379	7124460	Just things to think about.
7124620	7126862	I don't know one way or the other.
7127002	7132045	It kind of almost reminds me of the old school Nintendo.
7132666	7138129	Every time a new console would come out, you can't use the old school games in the new console.
7138189	7144854	So it's like you just plunker down 15 bucks to buy that really awesome version of Zelda that won't go in your Super Nintendo.
7145354	7146615	Nothing was backward compatible.
7146695	7152037	That's why I kind of stuck to the PlayStation series so I can play my old PlayStation games on the PS2.
7152217	7155939	I guess they're all backward compatible with the PS3 too.
7156039	7159620	PS1 is, and this is what doesn't make sense about Sony.
7159720	7164862	It depends what console you got and how early you bought a PS3 if you can backwards compatible or can't.
7165122	7166123	I think she can, but I can't.
7166163	7169624	I can because we have a first release PS3.
7169664	7173946	They took out a lot of the extra bells and whistles with later releases.
7174546	7202118	so if I bought a PS3 now I wouldn't be able to he probably couldn't do jack shit no sir not unless you got really lucky in finding a used one and a lot of people jack up the prices of those that are backwards compatible you know what's extra funny is that usually Dan and I wait until second releases come out when we get stuff because we're usually not initial adopters of consoles and phones and stuff but we got this right away and we sort of got a reward because our discover card gave us back a hundred bucks
7203338	7205581	So would a new PS3 let you play a PS2 game?
7205601	7208643	Because I know they still sell PS2 games.
7209324	7211787	However, I think I've got an extra PS2 you could probably borrow.
7212027	7213628	I have a PS2 that works just fine.
7213688	7215110	You can play PS1 games.
7216537	7217378	and Imports, right?
7217618	7218279	Import PS1 games.
7219000	7224365	No, the region locks are still in place for PS1 and PS2 but it's region free for the new games.
7224906	7225346	That's right.
7225526	7226828	PS3 games are region free.
7227288	7227829	Yeah.
7227969	7236557	Which is interesting but you might remember like Loki imported a racing game that he thought was awful but he imported it.
7237778	7247183	And the exciting thing is, if Beatmania 2DX ever comes out on the PlayStation 3, I know that was the game that made me buy a Japanese PlayStation 2 so I could play it.
7247203	7247563	Same here.
7247703	7250044	That's how obsessed with this music game series I was.
7250604	7254826	If they do release that on PS3 in the future, which I hope they will, it's going to break down that...
7255987	7256527	Yeah, we did ours too.
7271196	7271416	I know.
7272717	7273377	A lot of people did.
7273397	7273978	It wasn't just me.
7274198	7275999	I still have my old clunker at home.
7276239	7279802	My wonderful, the original PS2 box.
7280282	7288007	Props to those PS2s for holding up after all those years because I believe we heard Bobby on the show right before us talking about his Xbox 360 red-ringed.
7288428	7292350	One of my friends just sent me a text over the weekend, my 360 red-ringed frown face.
7293211	7294511	They don't build them like they used to.
7294591	7295132	No, they don't.
7295412	7301614	My PS2 is still up and going because I don't use it that much, mostly for DVDs, but yeah, it still works.
7302214	7308016	I'm not real confident about Sony optical drives, just bad experiences, but we'll see how long it lasts.
7308056	7308696	So far, so good.
7309606	7312487	Breast Lowell is in our chat and says, I still want to get a JPS2.
7312547	7314367	Well, the good news is it's really cheap now.
7314667	7316368	You probably get it for only about $100 now.
7316748	7317748	Maybe $120, $150.
7317888	7319889	For a Japanese PlayStation 2, yes.
7320189	7324310	But keep in mind, if you import a console from Japan, it's only going to play the Japanese games.
7324830	7329291	So there's got to be something out there that you can't get here, like dating sims.
7329891	7330131	All right.
7331411	7333532	Let's go to our mailbag.
7335342	7337564	Let's see if some of the faces have changed in our mailbag.
7337584	7340086	We're talking about some things never change.
7340246	7341206	Let's see about the emails.
7341547	7344389	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us an email.
7344429	7346030	I think we got quite a few this week, right Jamie?
7346891	7347451	A few more, yeah.
7348091	7351494	Hello, this is your friendly neighborhood Mexican, except in Arizona, Actdeft.
7352054	7354917	First of all, very late congrats on your 8th anniversary.
7355077	7355957	Keep up the good work.
7356238	7356798	Thank you, sir.
7357518	7360621	Now that I said that, I want to comment on some stuff you talked about on your last show.
7361101	7362882	First, about the connect and the move.
7363803	7365784	You asked people if they're going to buy either of them.
7365844	7375329	I'll probably get the Kinect later when it gets cheaper, because I really want to try both Dance Central and Dance Master, and probably other games that Microsoft may release in the future.
7375989	7378390	And Kinect does really look awesome.
7378610	7385874	But the move, first of all, I don't own a PS3 yet, so before I get the move, I need a really good reason to get a PS3, which right now is nothing.
7386997	7388218	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7406676	7411621	I consider that their biggest problem and why the move may fail.
7412522	7416386	And the PlayStation Network in Mexico and other Latin American countries sucks.
7416827	7420911	Seriously, little to no content at all, and they want me to pay for a plus service too?
7421171	7421632	Yeah, right.
7422938	7424860	Wow, this is a long email.
7425101	7427904	Another thing that you discussed was controllers versus keyboards and mouse.
7428364	7431168	I really think it comes down to what you're playing and how you're playing.
7431668	7435893	For first person shooters, sure, keyboard and mouse are way better because of precision and other stuff.
7436254	7442621	But for platformers or action games, I prefer controllers since it will give more comfort and allow you to do more stuff like jumping and attacking.
7443762	7458892	I'm going to put two games as an example, Mirror's Edge and Psychonauts Mirror's Edge, while you can play with a keyboard and mouse just fine there are a lot of button combinations that are easier to do with a controller and with Psychonauts the game was designed for consoles so the keyboard controls are just plain awkward
7459853	7468396	There are games that are easier with keyboard and mouse like Team Fortress 2 and Left 4 Dead, not to mention point-and-click adventures, western RPGs, strategy games, or MMOs.
7468996	7473338	So I think you just need to learn both ways of controlling games and get the hang of both.
7473578	7479040	There's no better way of playing games in general, just a more comfortable way to play certain games, which I agree with, by the way.
7479981	7481162	So that's all I want to say.
7481242	7481963	Thanks for reading.
7482063	7482684	Until next time.
7482965	7483245	P.S.
7483685	7487871	Sorry my lack of articles on the OLR main page, but no internet at home makes it difficult to do so.
7488251	7488692	P.S.S.
7488952	7490634	Suck it, Arizona, and your racist laws.
7491596	7492497	Deft is Cabrown.
7495073	7513207	Um, well, I think, especially the keyboard mouse part, I think a lot of the debate usually is around first person shooters, but definitely you bring up a good point about, you know, it really depends on the type of game you're playing, absolutely, is that, you know, keyboard mouse ain't gonna cut it, I think, as well for a game like Psychonauts, but...
7514088	7517829	For me, I don't know if it's because... I don't even know how to explain it.
7517909	7522071	I used to play Quake just fine with keyboard and mouse, but some of these new games are just too many buttons.
7523691	7527173	I know, I know, but yet when I hold a controller in my hand, it makes sense.
7527313	7528153	I can't explain it.
7528253	7529654	I don't expect anyone else to understand it.
7529774	7530674	It's just the way it is for me.
7530874	7539216	I'll tell you what's funny is that when I was playing PSO, I could not, I mean, you can play it with a keyboard, it just was much more comfortable with a controller.
7539756	7544417	But Final Fantasy XI, everyone was saying, why aren't you playing with a keyboard, why aren't you using a keyboard, why aren't you using a keyboard?
7544678	7546558	I'm like, because I can do just fine with my controller.
7547658	7548959	I wanted one for World of Warcraft.
7549179	7551479	I hate playing World of Warcraft because I hate playing it on the keyboard.
7552860	7553660	What about Star Trek Online?
7553680	7554320	Isn't that all keyboard?
7554685	7562328	It is, but for some reason, when you get into space combat, it really helps to have a mouse.
7563249	7563589	Interesting.
7563889	7568731	Because you can rotate your camera with it, as well as do direct targeting.
7570132	7571572	So, it works a lot better.
7571692	7579956	As well as the difference between even different versions of the same game, like the different Wii versus PlayStation versions.
7580036	7582897	Like, I played the original PlayStation 2 version of Okami...
7583577	7584158	Yay!
7584738	7585179	Fun game.
7585859	7591924	And then I played the Wii re-release, and surprisingly, I liked the PlayStation 1 better.
7592424	7598669	Because the Wii Remote, I don't know what it was, it just felt more...
7599824	7600484	Clunky.
7600904	7601765	You know what I mean?
7602285	7605106	It felt like it was rushed.
7605286	7615231	It felt like it was, you know, they were just trying to hurry it out as fast as they could and they didn't bother with the calibration that they needed to make it good.
7616391	7617872	With PlayStation 2, you don't have that problem.
7618052	7619512	You do not have that problem with Okami.
7623914	7624795	How about the next email?
7625095	7626535	We're fond of calling it the Wiimote.
7629368	7636196	Weemote, Weemote, Weemote, Weemote, Weemote, Weemote, I don't know this.
7636216	7637017	I don't own one.
7639180	7643364	Good morning everyone, this is Jeet, it's the other Swede, writing in once again.
7644265	7650229	This time I'd like to comment a bit on the discussion that was brought forth last time concerning the accuracy and comfort when it comes to controllers.
7650790	7655994	Now, I could start a five-page rant about why a mouse and keyboard is far superior to any console controllers, but I won't.
7656774	7661878	The reason is that I am very biased, and due to that bias, I can't objectively say that the mouse is better.
7662378	7667222	It's only a personal preference embedded in me during my childhood thanks to my uncle who introduced me to PC gaming.
7667942	7677373	It's simple, whatever controller you like, be it an Xbox 360 controller, Playstation Move, or mouse, it's only the best peripheral for you personally, not the whole world and everyone in it.
7677594	7678074	Thank you!
7679416	7687565	To sum it up, the discussion of what control method is the quote best is pointless since it all comes down to what you are skilled at using or prefer.
7688266	7688646	P.S.
7689046	7691307	Note that I didn't apologize for any spelling errors this time.
7691547	7698710	That's because I realized it's rude for someone who grew up with English as their primary language to comment on minor flaws of someone who learned it as a second language.
7699310	7702011	Let's see you typing a letter to me in Swedish without grammatical errors in it.
7702071	7703492	I still love you, even you, DarkSakura.
7704392	7708534	And by the way, if I know someone's typing from another country, I don't give them a hard time.
7709554	7709954	If I know.
7710835	7711575	If I don't, I'm sorry.
7712595	7713156	P.S.S.
7713456	7715517	Thanks for reading my letter and I hope your hand is feeling better.
7715737	7716757	Thank you, but it's not.
7718084	7723331	Drew Nami in our chatroom at chat.orange.radio.com says, IKEA controller for the Swedish email.
7723791	7724232	There you go.
7724752	7725273	Uh-huh.
7726274	7729578	And yeah, apparently it's international email night at Orange Challenge Radio.
7729598	7732922	But hey, that's awesome to know that we have listeners all over the globe.
7732962	7733583	That's so awesome.
7733991	7734771	Alright, next email.
7735792	7738314	Hey Orange Lounge, long time listener, first time responder.
7739114	7741095	Ooh, we got the cliche.
7741435	7741756	Love it.
7742276	7747039	As for the move, personally I think it will be the better motion control option.
7747399	7752562	Yes, the price point is high, but I think it will be the most accurate on the most powerful system of the three.
7753102	7758185	I saw some great screen tests demonstrating its abilities and I think it could be a hardcore alternative to the Wii.
7758626	7760347	That's the main reason I have avoided the Wii.
7760427	7761728	It lacks the hardcore devotion.
7761748	7762168	Snow5.
7765154	7767557	Just playing devil's advocate to your email.
7767678	7778012	I kind of get that perspective and that's why a lot of people have avoided the Wii, but what about games like Brawl and Metroid Other M and some of these other kind of like, and GoldenEye, some of these other cool things that are on the Wii.
7778072	7780755	I mean, is that not hardcore enough?
7780775	7781476	No More Heroes?
7782157	7806003	yeah I mean I don't know it's kind of like I it feels like there's some cool stuff on the way I mean granted maybe not as much and yeah we kind of made some errors when it comes to not being online I think that's one of their like biggest flaws is that there's the multiplayer online is just a joke you know compared to what else is out there I agree but appreciate the perspective we have two more emails to go no
7806684	7807004	Too bad!
7807024	7809186	Oh, that's why you sound like an auctioneer.
7827017	7827217	Yes.
7828999	7833003	Second is I'm wondering if there was a way to get the live stream via mobile platform, i.e.
7833083	7833683	a MotoDroid.
7833844	7840730	Third is actually two things in the first letting being that DarkSakura is a fiend for grammar, spelling, and punctuation.
7840750	7844413	I thought it might interest you to know that the site has lasted, has several
7845134	7849075	Lastly, I wonder what point during this email she stops reading this and starts to have convulsions.
7849416	7854317	As I've written this without punctuation, I have made several misspellings and several grammatical errors on purpose.
7854737	7857838	Not that I don't like her or anything, I just thought that I might get a giggle.
7858159	7859719	Good times all and keep up the good work.
7860339	7864081	I figured by then it was, hey, you did use...
7866997	7871041	You gotta laugh at me anytime somebody writes in to give DarkSakura some shit.
7871081	7871501	I love it.
7871962	7876346	No, I'm laughing at this because I realized by that point that it was on purpose.
7876706	7878207	So this is a punctuation troll?
7879509	7883873	Wow, we have our first grammar troll on Orange Lounge Radio.
7883913	7884633	That's awesome.
7884653	7885614	You get a gold star.
7885634	7886895	You totally get a gold star.
7886935	7888437	And this is from Kane I Am.
7888857	7890659	They didn't sign it, but I'm taking it from the email.
7890819	7895401	Kane IM, you get a gold star for being the first grammar troll at Orange Lounge Radio.
7895581	7897822	And the subject of the subject is we, yay, wahoo.
7898402	7902024	Please, that is not encouraging others to copy what this gentleman has done.
7902484	7905265	Yeah, because if you do it the first time, you're clever.
7905405	7907166	Anyone who does it the second time is stupid.
7907492	7910033	All right, what was the real question here, though?
7910053	7912775	There was something in there I actually wanted to answer that had come up in there.
7912855	7913915	Oh, Loki's job.
7914395	7915596	He works for a game distributor.
7915796	7922619	So he actually, like, he's kind of the middleman between gaming companies and the actual stores.
7923900	7925861	I know that for iPhone we use apps.
7945046	7952930	There's an All Games app on the iPhone, supposedly, but I guess it disappeared this week, so I don't know what's going on there.
7952990	7955752	That's a Scott question, not a Rob question, so I don't know.
7956792	7957673	But I will say this.
7957833	7961555	Any program that can use Shoutcast can listen to the All Games stream.
7961835	7964096	You just have to get the link for the Shoutcast feed.
7964136	7965817	It's a little silly for me to yell it out here.
7965877	7967658	I think Pandora has a...
7969184	7971886	Go to all... Well, Pandora's... Does it have shoutcast mode in it, though?
7972006	7972306	I don't know.
7972346	7972826	I don't know.
7973086	7976528	But most mobile phones have some type of shoutcast tuner app.
7976608	7981191	I mean, anything that's like, listen to thousands of internet radio stations is probably a shoutcast app.
7981571	7986073	And if you go to allgames.com, you can get the link to listen to all games radio.
7986534	7986714	Yeah.
7986834	7987374	It's pretty easy.
7988134	7988435	Okay.
7988875	7990876	And then the grammar thing.
7991616	7992337	Which I'm laughing.
7992397	7994698	I'm actually laughing because I realized it was on purpose.
7994963	8007188	How funny, Tiger, I'm sorry, I have to say this, Tiger Call in our chat room is saying since the All Games app isn't up right now, you can get the Video Game Outsiders iPhone app because they're another show on the network, they do Tuesdays here, and I guess their app does it.
8008288	8008728	That's cool.
8009749	8011810	So, I guess a backup.
8012090	8012670	The last one.
8015452	8016373	Greetings, OLR.
8016493	8017073	Rini here.
8017873	8022194	I will soon be the proud owner of a new Beatles Rock Band limited edition bundle that I scored for $20.
8023515	8032517	However, I have not owned a Rock Band game until now, so I was wondering if you and the listeners could give any advice on what I should know about keeping my gear in great condition.
8034538	8035238	I would say...
8037043	8039046	Sanitize it if other people play it.
8040248	8043052	Especially if they have greasy fingers.
8043352	8045675	Or liquor is being mixed with those controllers.
8046116	8046637	Seriously.
8047276	8055139	Yes, um, those monitor wipes that you can use to clean, like, your computer screen, those might be good for it.
8055219	8056360	Alcohol prep pads, yo.
8056460	8057921	Mm-hmm.
8057941	8061622	Because alcohol just dries... Clorox wipes are, like, the greatest invention ever.
8061642	8062903	Yeah, but you gotta be careful with those.
8063043	8064984	Well, that's true, you don't want to bleach your controllers, I guess that's true.
8065004	8075328	Now, the horrible thing is, is when you said, you know, if alcohol's being mixed with drinks, I got this horrible mental image of a Rock Band controller mixing a giant vat of alcohol.
8076476	8077750	I wouldn't use it for that purpose.
8078482	8081463	You must hate your rock band if you're doing that.
8082284	8087306	Also, when you store them, make sure that you don't have them stacked up haphazardly.
8088707	8095050	We usually stand ours up on end and put them in a corner to where they won't really fall on each other.
8095190	8100933	If you really want to take good care of them, and this is the way to do it, just go get one of those big plastic storage tubs at Target.
8101493	8103254	It would cost you only a couple bucks.
8103394	8104554	Ikea would have them too.
8104694	8105795	Any place ought to have it.
8106195	8107076	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
8123120	8124361	Don't Stop Believin'
8152125	8152886	is really all you need.
8153026	8153787	Skull Crusher Mountain.
8154888	8157391	Definitely look for the free stuff on the Marketplace.
8157431	8158432	Jonathan Colton stuff.
8158572	8160494	It's really about what type of music you're into.
8160614	8161335	And Stephen Colbert.
8162936	8163517	Lady Gaga.
8164057	8165359	Blah.
8165579	8166800	Blah yourself.
8166900	8167321	Haters.
8167701	8168102	Haters.
8168262	8169022	Haters.
8169103	8170204	Haters gonna hate, Rob.
8170224	8170764	Haters gonna hate.
8170784	8171265	That's right.
8171545	8172066	Oh, boy.
8173550	8173930	That's it.
8175371	8176532	Stop the hate.
8176772	8177412	That's right.
8178132	8188278	I have actually said this, Rob, and I made this statement clear when we went out to Vic's Ice Cream downtown, that I do not dislike Lady Gaga.
8188878	8194701	I dislike the radio versions of her songs, but every time I've heard piano versions, I've really liked them.
8197429	8201053	Okay.
8201113	8201893	No one cur.
8202174	8205817	I thought you just disliked the performance art aspects of her videos.
8206117	8209220	Well, I don't like her videos, but I mean, I like the video for Alejandro.
8209901	8212663	I don't like the videos, but the songs are pretty awesome.
8213444	8214325	I like video games.
8214866	8215746	Yes, let's go on.
8216627	8217788	I also like Angst.
8217848	8220651	What a perfect segue into our FUs of the week.
8221051	8221672	Yay!
8236161	8243686	And now for those new to Orange Lounge Radio, this is the part of the show where we just say a big F you to whatever we've been waiting to say an F you to all week.
8243846	8244347	DarkSakura?
8245147	8249350	F you to the hole in my hand and to my husband's blood pressure.
8250491	8253073	We're gonna beat you, butthead.
8253933	8254173	Okay.
8256375	8260898	I'm gonna give an F you to all the sand in my hypothetical vagina that I apparently have today.
8261138	8261418	I just...
8263188	8264969	are you feeling a little gritty and not so fresh?
8265069	8281240	yes I have to say a big F you to any gaming company who is willing to charge multiple dollars for copies of games that I already own yes, I'm talking to you, PlayStation
8283675	8289356	Okay, the biggest FU, well, general FUs all around too.
8289916	8292377	Let's see, the list is long and distinguished, we'll keep it short.
8292737	8295858	Fox News, Sarah Palin, Meg Whitman, boo!
8298238	8300239	Carly Fiorna, oh god, no.
8300379	8301479	I thought you were keeping it short.
8301699	8303179	Yeah, yeah, I am keeping it short.
8303639	8305720	And the whole Republican Party, go rot, FU.
8308154	8309976	That won't generate any emails tonight.
8310957	8314560	By the way, Rob, as an official woman, you can have an honorary vag.
8316181	8316802	Oh, yay.
8316902	8318203	Just what I've always wanted.
8318363	8319204	You can keep it.
8319845	8321226	These things are nothing but trouble.
8324301	8325661	So you don't have to have a hypothetical one.
8325681	8326722	You can have an honorary one.
8327182	8327842	I don't want one.
8327942	8329223	What's the difference?
8330023	8331363	They're both non-existent.
8331383	8332023	Send it back.
8332163	8334604	Return to sender.
8335004	8336145	Do not want.
8336265	8337825	Rob's pet vag.
8341106	8341986	My little vag.
8343767	8345928	There's a product idea for Hasbro.
8346568	8347388	Imagine vagina.
8352159	8352519	All right.
8353620	8355302	Anyhow, let's move on.
8355382	8356763	Loki is in our chat room right now.
8357083	8357484	What?
8357544	8359285	He joined on the hospital Wi-Fi.
8359866	8360866	He's in chat right now.
8360986	8361267	What?
8361307	8362268	For free Wi-Fi?
8362328	8363048	I second that.
8363168	8364629	I don't know if he's listening or what.
8364790	8370074	I just sent him a private message if I can call him, but I don't know if he can see.
8370114	8370715	He probably can't hear.
8370755	8371535	Free slow Wi-Fi.
8371715	8373217	That's what you get when it's free Wi-Fi.
8373257	8374418	It's slow Wi-Fi.
8378000	8378580	I don't know.
8378600	8379981	So we'll see if we can call them or not.
8380481	8381101	We'll see.
8381141	8382681	But for now, we're going to keep on moving with the news.
8384362	8384702	Let's see.
8385062	8390384	Metroid Other M. Now here's a Wii game that's going to be pretty hardcore for that person earlier.
8390484	8392224	But yeah, I'm excited about this game.
8392264	8394905	I'm finally going to dust off the Wii after like six months of not playing it.
8395325	8397125	This is kind of an interesting mode they're putting in the game.
8397165	8400386	It's going to be a theater mode in Metroid Other M. That's right.
8400486	8405788	If you want to just watch the movie Metroid Other M, you can do that.
8406488	8406848	That's right.
8407108	8411590	There's a theater mode, according to one of the designers at Nintendo, Yoshio Sakamoto.
8411890	8416551	There's a theater mode that lets you view all of the cutscenes linked together seamlessly as a single movie.
8417131	8425934	We placed just as much weight on enjoying the story as we did on the action aspects of the game, but it's hard to fully communicate a storyline in a video game with just one playthrough.
8426494	8432899	At the same time, though, it's asking a lot of players to beat the game twice to get it all, so that's where the idea for that mode came from.
8433260	8437803	It lets you make a lot of discoveries, things you missed, or dialogue that makes more sense in retrospect.
8438304	8440545	I hope it helps people understand the story better.
8441546	8443188	Interesting approach.
8443968	8455938	That almost kind of reminds me of Final Fantasy X. They had the theater that was in Luka that you could go to and buy the individual cutscenes, which was really nice when you wanted to look at them all together.
8456458	8460240	And I was going to say, people have been kind of doing this whole like cutscene movie thing for years.
8460300	8468763	Like, I'm pretty sure I could probably go on YouTube and just see, you know, nothing but cutscenes from some of the more recent Final Fantasy games and get a pretty good sense of what the story is all about.
8468903	8473225	So kind of interesting that the game is now kind of officially endorsing that idea.
8473285	8474865	But I like his reasoning behind it.
8475205	8478446	He's just kind of like, you know what, you shouldn't have to beat the game twice to get everything.
8480067	8506015	and you might kind of go it's nintendo easy mode just hit the button or whatever but you know i i i i'll give them a little credit i think something as epic as metroid is is worthy of a theater mode so is it cheating if you watch the whole movie first and then you play the game or yes but in my opinion that's no worse than going on the internet and reading the entire faq before you play the game good point yeah that's true i mean is it really any worse i
8508429	8510109	I'm okay with it.
8510149	8510509	Let's see.
8510609	8513290	TigerClaw says, now the question is how long is the theater mode?
8513370	8516211	Usually cutscenes, when you add them all together, they aren't usually an hour.
8516492	8517572	They're saying two hours.
8518292	8521013	Two hours is divided into chapters just like a DVD.
8521454	8523554	It's not just the cutscenes.
8524014	8528856	There's actually pre-recorded gameplay that will be intertwined with it.
8530057	8535439	Although I guess at one point they wanted to actually have recorded bits of you playing the game.
8535839	8540062	that would then go into theater mode, but it's too big of a pain in the ass, basically, and I'll tell you why.
8540102	8542264	It's because there's no decent storage on the Wii.
8542804	8545786	Even though that's not what they're saying, I'm totally filling in the gaps there and making it up.
8546267	8547147	It's gotta be the reason.
8547307	8548829	You can't store that information.
8548969	8550610	But it is watching an actual movie.
8550990	8551491	Pretty much.
8551951	8552711	That's kinda cool.
8552751	8554313	I mean, how many people are perfectly content?
8554613	8560077	Dark Sakura comes in here, and a lot of her gaming weeks usually are, I watched Dan play blank.
8560597	8563699	There's a lot of people that game by watching other people game.
8564300	8564420	Well,
8565601	8572626	Part of it for me is that he'll play a lot of single player stuff and loves to just completely dominate the front room.
8574427	8577609	Usually if I'm out there and he's playing something, it's just me watching him play something.
8577629	8579370	Especially now since I had my hand surgery.
8580711	8583393	I really get a lot of enjoyment out of just sitting down watching him play.
8583493	8589217	I could sit and watch him play Grand Theft Horse for a while because it was very cinematic.
8590217	8591658	Isn't watching games boring?
8591918	8592038	No.
8592958	8593759	It's like watching a movie.
8594359	8598401	I have a DVD that's all the cutscenes of Final Fantasy X-2.
8598962	8601583	Alan will watch me PvP in WoW and he enjoys it.
8601623	8604064	Of course, he likes to play backseat driver too, but that's okay.
8604524	8604885	It's fun.
8605245	8605865	I like doing that.
8606365	8606685	It's cool.
8608686	8608967	Alright.
8610848	8616250	DarkSakura, one more story and then I've got one more story as well and then we're going to get to the phones.
8616270	8617571	877-GAME-OLR in just a moment.
8617811	8621136	It's kind of funny because this is something I downloaded and never got a chance to play.
8621216	8622678	I was actually sitting here trying to play it.
8623479	8628826	It was the Gorillas Escape to Plastic Beach, which is on iPad and iPhone.
8628966	8629467	Oh, nice.
8630808	8631249	Good band.
8632070	8632851	What's that about?
8633692	8636793	Well, it's basically them trying to get to the plastic beach.
8638634	8647617	You either play Murdoch, who flies on a doom glider, and he's trying to keep 2D from escaping.
8648337	8648657	Nice.
8649537	8650478	You know, so it's...
8652059	8656661	It's only $1.99 and you can get it as a browser game too.
8657402	8659683	So it's pretty cute.
8659783	8661504	Here, let me start it up again.
8661764	8664626	I know this is fantastic because you won't probably be able to hear it very well.
8666567	8667828	It seems interesting to me though.
8667868	8673171	I mean usually these are the type of things you put out before an album comes out to kind of raise awareness about it.
8673992	8676593	So it's a little weird that this is coming out now.
8676994	8677574	Is this picking up?
8679996	8680917	Very quietly.
8680977	8682739	Most of our listeners probably won't be able to hear it very well.
8684020	8688664	Headphone people will probably be able to hear it okay, but speaker people probably not.
8690105	8691406	I'm trying to let you hear the beginning of it.
8693368	8693888	It's loading.
8693988	8694969	It's just beep beep boops.
8695970	8696751	We can hear it there a little bit.
8702597	8703618	Oh, I'm so British.
8724403	8725846	Making more money off the characters.
8725926	8726547	But hey, you know what?
8726587	8731217	If they can have Britney Spears apps and sing along to Tap Tap Bieber or whatever those games are.
8732499	8733622	She's such a cute little girl.
8733962	8734103	Who?
8734992	8741138	Justine Bieber That's awesome I was like, who are you talking about?
8741298	8742138	Britney Spears?
8742178	8756171	She's not a little girl anymore No, Justine Bieber Oh, Justine Bieber, okay She's the cutest little lesbian, I swear I'm a big Gorillaz fan, so this is so cute But man, looking at the iPad version though, I'd really love to play the iPad one
8757358	8759040	It looks like fun.
8759580	8760902	Murdoch and his Doom Glider.
8761382	8767288	One more story for you guys about a guy who now will have plenty of money to develop games on the iPad if he chooses to.
8767809	8768750	Richard Garriott.
8769230	8771893	He is the guy that made Ultima many, many years ago.
8771933	8772634	Remember Ultima?
8773134	8775537	It was epic epicness.
8775577	8777459	I know I spent a lot of time playing Ultima Exodus.
8777799	8777919	Ooh.
8777959	8778059	Ooh.
8807310	8808130	Well, here's the deal.
8808810	8815651	Apparently, it came out today that out of the $47 million that Richard Garriott was seeking, he was actually awarded $28 million.
8815692	8816972	Touching.
8817252	8817652	Yikes.
8818272	8819392	So, there you go.
8819492	8826853	Apparently, they did find that there was some misrepresentation going on there and some contracts were breached and so forth.
8827454	8828554	Very unfortunate.
8828654	8834075	You know what's unfortunate, though, is that NCSoft makes a lot of... I hope they have good insurance, like legal insurance or something, because...
8835775	8850504	they make a lot of MMOs and hopefully this won't hit them in the pockets really hard because they've got a lot of stuff under development at MCSoft right now this is going to suck that they're going to have to pay this guy out $28 million because they screwed up some things
8853146	8854867	Tabula Rasa was an interesting game.
8854927	8855928	It's kind of a bummer.
8856048	8857289	It got kind of a crappy break.
8857429	8857769	I don't know.
8859290	8860711	Maybe they just didn't promote it well enough.
8860771	8861051	I don't know.
8861071	8863953	Or maybe just nothing was able to beat WoW at that time.
8864013	8864393	I don't know.
8865073	8866414	But there it is.
8866955	8867235	All right.
8867295	8875520	We are going to go ahead and open up the Skype line if you want to give us a call at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8875680	8879462	Go ahead and give us a call and we'll take a few calls before we end the show.
8879542	8880363	Close up shop tonight.
8882003	8901949	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username is Orange Lounge Radio I was hoping Loki would call us but I guess his Wi-Fi at the hospital is not so great he's not getting the private messages but that's okay he's got better things to do than talk to us honestly I know we're his friends and everything but he's got more important stuff tonight it's all good it's all good
8904311	8906892	We should try to take the mics on the road and go see the baby.
8907232	8907832	That would be fun.
8908012	8909673	That would be absolutely cute.
8909773	8913033	At the same time, everybody probably wants to be left the fuck alone right now.
8913053	8919035	Keep in mind, for like the next month, all this baby is going to be able to see is Blur, Blur, Blur.
8919275	8920095	Ooh, Red!
8920395	8921276	But you like Blur.
8921536	8922296	They're a great band.
8922896	8923116	Yeah.
8923576	8923856	Dork.
8923896	8924677	We got a phone call.
8924757	8925897	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8925917	8926317	Who's this?
8927117	8929578	Hey, it's Ranma, back from Otakon 2010.
8929998	8931679	Hey, Ranma, what's up?
8931719	8932099	Sup?
8932119	8932159	Hi.
8932599	8933239	How you doing?
8934697	8935698	I'm doing good.
8935718	8939002	I'm a little tired, but it's a con.
8939022	8939682	What do you expect?
8940203	8941304	You didn't get con funk, did you?
8942205	8943546	Cons are always exhausting.
8943566	8947991	No, just so you know, the term con funk is officially dead.
8948391	8950373	It's been replaced with hobo.
8951274	8951555	What?
8951575	8951875	What?
8952215	8952716	Okay.
8953036	8953857	I haven't heard that before.
8953877	8954037	Hobo.
8955168	8955488	Hobo.
8955688	8958709	Horrific otaku body odor.
8959430	8960070	Oh, God.
8960510	8962711	A similar thing happens at game conventions, too.
8962871	8963551	No, no, no.
8963591	8968353	Confunk, but keep in mind, Confunk also, though, encompasses con disease.
8970614	8976696	Which was coined here in California, which was coined for quite a while here in California as the Dorbola.
8978237	8980138	Because remember, we can track it back to Doreen.
8981747	8982647	I remember that, yes.
8983088	8983428	Anyway.
8983448	8984008	He got married.
8984588	8985329	I know, I know.
8986209	8988190	How was the con, Ranma?
8989551	8993132	It was good, despite some of the couple of things that happened this weekend.
8993152	8998195	I had fun, my staff had fun, and I saw an ITG3 machine there.
9000050	9001191	Wait, they made an In The Groove 3?
9001291	9003914	There was an In The Groove 3 machine.
9004114	9007899	It wasn't on, so I don't know what was on it.
9007939	9010421	My game report, I'll have to ask her what was on the machine.
9010581	9014786	Didn't they get sued to all hell and they can't make any more?
9015467	9017169	Was there a third mix officially?
9018943	9019863	I don't know.
9019883	9022924	I think it was in process before it got shut down.
9023004	9026645	So, you know, maybe someone snuck it out and threw it onto a machine or something.
9026745	9029026	I do have a picture of the unit.
9029126	9031006	A purposefully leaked prototype.
9031046	9031807	You said unit.
9031907	9035168	Hitstun in chat says ITG3 is a mod of ITG2.
9035228	9037088	That wouldn't surprise me either, actually.
9037448	9038208	That makes sense.
9038789	9040809	And oddly enough, there was no DDR machines there.
9040889	9044910	It was just that one ITG machine and two Pump It Up Pro 2 machines.
9045530	9045931	Interesting.
9046691	9047331	Yeah, very.
9048632	9049813	What else in the gaming world?
9050994	9055017	Well, I didn't cover too much of the gaming because I was more covering everything else.
9055037	9057579	But I can tell you about gaming cosplays.
9057899	9058960	I can tell you this much.
9059320	9065164	Every year when a Final Fantasy game comes out, everybody and their mother does cosplays.
9065224	9069307	And for the longest time, the big cosplay was always Final Fantasy VII.
9069968	9070849	I can tell you this right now.
9070869	9075132	There was about 12 to 13 Final Fantasy cosplayers.
9076192	9077674	Six to seven of them were from XIII.
9079426	9079846	Wow.
9079906	9081968	Well, 13's very cosplayable.
9083168	9083648	You know what I mean?
9083668	9087070	It is, but I don't think it really went over well with a lot of the fans.
9087090	9089512	Because from what I've talked to a lot of people, at first they love 13.
9089552	9091533	They're like, what the shit is this?
9097056	9097376	I don't know.
9097416	9098357	I still like 13.
9098417	9099938	I don't know what y'all's problem is, but whatever.
9100618	9102259	I enjoy 13 too, you know.
9103120	9104520	The battle system just kind of threw me.
9105441	9106802	That's probably what it is.
9108578	9126438	gotcha someone was supposed to lend me their copy I keep forgetting I'm sorry you have to like text me right before a show one night when I'm not in the bay so let's see what else do I want to ask you about the con well quickly any really cool like events even anime style or whatever what were some memorable moments of the con
9127575	9134520	Okay, my best memorable moment was the concert I went to this afternoon.
9134640	9138243	It was a Japanese hip-hop group called Homei Kazoku.
9139004	9148551	The best way I can describe them is, if you remember hip-hop rap music from the 80s when it was good, that take it to the next level.
9150012	9150452	I see.
9152053	9153054	As good as Dragon Ash?
9154671	9156653	Honestly, I think they're better than Dragon Ash.
9156973	9157233	Really?
9157433	9158054	Oh, snap.
9158814	9165120	And generally, when a lot of Japanese artists come over, they always have a little bit of trouble speaking English to the fans.
9166241	9170264	They were speaking 100% English.
9170844	9172946	No stuttering, no rough edges.
9173006	9175088	It was just straight, clear, right across the board.
9175188	9180792	And I've been to a lot of J-rock, J-pop concerts at Otakon and other conventions.
9182660	9186162	At this concert, everybody was on their feet going nuts.
9186282	9189304	I have never seen a crowd this wild.
9190104	9190444	Awesome.
9192045	9194326	Well, Ranma, we gotta wrap up so we can get more calls.
9194346	9195767	Do you have anything else you want to say about the con?
9196647	9199028	There was a fire at the convention center.
9199168	9199408	What?
9200389	9200629	Yes.
9201589	9202670	Did somebody say fire?
9221869	9223189	So what'd you say on fire, Ranma?
9224370	9224730	Rob?
9225610	9225850	What?
9226991	9227891	You're a dick.
9228671	9229972	But you know what?
9230012	9234553	I still love you.
9236294	9237994	Okay, like, not everybody gets that joke, Ranma.
9238294	9240235	Alright, well, tell us about the fire real quick.
9241082	9241723	What a con-ruiner.
9259622	9261543	and at least it wasn't snowing outside.
9263124	9271708	And talking to some people, I kind of figured out who started the grease fire and I think only me and Jamie will catch this joke as I post a link to the comment in the chat.
9271748	9273028	I did, I did, I did.
9273048	9275089	I like what Amaze Satsuma says in our chat room.
9275389	9279311	Con's on fire.
9279411	9280131	Nice, I like that.
9281472	9283593	I can be the theme song for when your con gets set on fire.
9284133	9285734	Alright, that's it.
9285814	9287655	We're going to hang up on you now so we can take more calls.
9287795	9288255	Have a good night.
9289096	9289556	Good night.
9289756	9290056	Bye.
9291657	9293278	Dude, fuck GameStop.
9293298	9294758	We're going to take another call real quick.
9295319	9297040	Then I want to know more about why you're angry.
9297340	9298320	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9298340	9298700	Who's this?
9300381	9301542	This is Kane IM.
9302482	9303263	I'm sorry, what was that?
9304343	9305304	It's Kane IM.
9306064	9307025	Kane IM.
9308225	9308625	I got it.
9308685	9309446	What's up, Kane IM?
9311292	9311832	Not much.
9312052	9316274	Actually, I did find a way to run the live show off my phone.
9316754	9319295	So, I do appreciate your guys' help.
9319635	9324657	Oh, he's the same guy who emailed in about getting the... Okay, so what did you end up using?
9327218	9328498	It was a shoutcast program.
9328538	9330018	I did a little bit of searching online.
9333380	9335000	Well, I'm glad you were able to find something.
9335040	9336501	I didn't call in because I wanted to know...
9338066	9341475	Do you guys have any suggestions on how to get an IRC program for my phone?
9345629	9347850	so that I can join in on the chat.
9348110	9350432	I know that there is one for iPhone.
9350572	9351612	I don't know about the Droid.
9351672	9358636	I hate to say iPhone again, but again, that All Games app, whenever it comes back, because I imagine its disappearance is only temporary, you can get on IRC.
9358656	9359557	The Droid has a browser, right?
9359657	9360657	Do you have a PSP?
9361018	9361278	Yes.
9361738	9369502	Okay, if you have a PSP, go to olrpsp.com and you can do the chat and the stream all from the PSP.
9370623	9374385	Unfortunately, I'm a truck driver and Wi-Fi is kind of scarce.
9374727	9375067	Yeah.
9375087	9375267	Yeah.
9397215	9397976	I'm not sure.
9398216	9406838	I'm opening up to our own chatters right now to see if they have any suggestions at chat.orangeloungeradio.com I guess just try to search for something IRC.
9407018	9415280	Because with any IRC client, you should be able to connect to the Game Surge Network, which is the network we're on.
9415620	9417801	And then it's just channel Orange Lounge.
9418441	9421763	Any IRC client can get to our room.
9421843	9424165	Here in studio, we use MIRC.
9424425	9427447	As Toa Gak in our chat says, IRC is IRC is IRC, right?
9428087	9429668	Yes, that's correct.
9430869	9437153	Unfortunately, I don't know what IRC clients exist on that platform, but you have to run a search and maybe Google can tell you.
9438734	9439334	All right, thanks.
9439994	9441115	All right, well, good luck to you.
9441956	9444137	Hey, any games that you've been playing while you've been out on the road?
9446573	9451897	I just got Naughty Bear and my one sinful pleasure is Harvest Moon.
9452077	9452917	How do you like Naughty Bear?
9452937	9453998	Because I really want to play it.
9455980	9458161	Picture Manhunt with teddy bears.
9458641	9460503	That's about all it is.
9460563	9461704	It's good for a giggle.
9461804	9462524	Here's the thing, though.
9462584	9463765	It sounds awesome.
9464065	9468188	And I remember when we were looking at the previews here in studio, we were so excited and everything else.
9468348	9471230	But I've heard the game is real shit.
9471351	9473312	Like, it's getting terrible reviews.
9473572	9474553	So I'm kind of, you know...
9474913	9479415	Not that reviewers necessarily know everything, but it did kind of give me pause.
9479475	9482456	I was like, wow, this game is doing really bad in the reviews.
9483677	9486998	Can you see that, why that's happening, or do you think it's totally unfounded?
9488559	9490259	The controls are a bit clunky.
9490319	9495041	The camera doesn't seem to want to cooperate with you.
9496782	9503765	I mean, I'll wait if you really want to play it until either someone else buys it, or we play it bargain-based.
9505231	9506372	I can... Maybe I'll do that.
9506432	9507493	Bargain Basement then.
9508154	9508454	Alright.
9508494	9510596	It's too bad they can't get some of those basic things right.
9510636	9512318	It's like they don't even play the game or something.
9512378	9512718	I don't know.
9513188	9515689	Well, then, in about, you know, a couple of months, I might just pick it up.
9517290	9518451	Wait, I thought you were an Xbox owner.
9519471	9523553	That doesn't mean I can't go over to somebody's house and play.
9523573	9525514	That's usually where I get all my gaming experiences.
9525574	9529376	I usually have some... I know a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy who owns a 360.
9529416	9530777	There you go.
9531777	9538020	Alright, well, KaneIM, we're going to let you get back to your thing, but thanks so much for the call, and good luck with the mobile phone quest.
9538040	9539101	We appreciate you trying so hard.
9540521	9541102	Alright, no problem.
9541122	9544005	You guys try and keep, you know, do what you're doing and take it easy.
9544185	9545126	Well, thank you very much.
9545266	9545987	Keep on trucking.
9546348	9546628	Alright.
9547929	9548150	Bye.
9548270	9549711	I've always wanted to say that to a truck driver.
9549792	9550072	Alright.
9552423	9554044	All right, anyhow, let's see.
9554124	9561748	I'm looking at chat and some folks clarifying some things about the OLR PSP and HitStun is saying, OLR PSP's chat is a shout box, not an IRC chat.
9561788	9562469	And that is correct.
9562769	9565371	There is no IRC clients that work on PSP right now.
9565751	9569813	Loki tried to get that to happen and he couldn't because you're absolutely right.
9569913	9571334	There's nothing that works right now.
9571554	9572014	So there it is.
9573175	9574276	We can do at least one more call.
9574336	9575256	Hi, you're on Orange Silence Radio.
9575276	9575617	Who's this?
9577009	9580471	Yeah, hello there, you all are.
9580491	9584133	This is that one, Aki Ripper, from Sweden.
9584253	9585834	Aki Ripper.
9585994	9586734	From Sweden.
9586794	9587915	It's the other Swede.
9587995	9589575	It's another Battle of the Swedes night.
9589635	9590036	I love it.
9590056	9591877	We had our emailer, and now we have Aki Ripper.
9592257	9595899	No, there's always room for at least two Swedish people.
9595939	9596319	You know what?
9596379	9599240	If a third Swedish person wanted to listen, I would welcome them, too.
9599961	9601601	What is on your mind?
9601862	9604283	And if there were four, we could make our own version of ABBA.
9604623	9606024	All right, Aki Ripper, what's on your mind?
9607064	9607385	Yeah?
9608025	9608746	What the funk?
9609426	9609786	Damn it.
9610687	9611268	What's on your mind?
9611528	9611808	Hello?
9613069	9613429	Yeah.
9613649	9613930	Hello?
9614050	9614770	What's on your mind?
9617392	9624798	I rambled on on the network one time and well, Stormcatcher 2 could be wonderful if I could play it.
9625799	9626279	Oh no.
9626719	9627980	Did they lock Sweden out?
9628841	9629321	No, no.
9629602	9633404	The thing is that I can't play it due to the thing that Battle.net
9636048	9649273	refused to accept that I have tapped in my key in Battle.net and said it's listed, but when I launched the game and said like, no, you do not have a StarCraft key associated with your Battle.net account.
9650333	9656595	Like, it's all listed there, but the game refuses to say yes or something.
9658126	9660587	We have an angry, angry Swede on the show tonight.
9660607	9663387	You hear that anger in his voice.
9663467	9666588	I'm quite pissed in that regard.
9668948	9675610	Well, around 900 Swedish crowns, which is like... I'm going to be rough.
9676770	9678710	How much, by the way, is the collector's edition?
9678730	9681131	Anyway, it's the collector's edition.
9681151	9681131	$99.
9681371	9682351	How much you pay it in...
9686624	9696392	And they can do it all, but it's somewhere around, well, it's somewhere around 90 bucks or even less.
9696792	9697032	Wow.
9697493	9700315	Well, here's a suggestion.
9700355	9701235	I don't even know if this works.
9701256	9702136	You've probably already done this.
9702557	9708381	Have you logged on to the web portal, going on to battle.net on the web and making sure that the game is associated there?
9708741	9711363	Yeah, well, it's listed there.
9712805	9715447	And, well, the thing is that, well, I've...
9717454	9718834	And here's the other thing, though.
9721336	9725199	The workaround that I'm trying to do is, well, change password.
9725519	9733344	If word for the following fact that I have forgotten my, like, hidden question... Uh-oh.
9733924	9734805	That's my problem.
9735045	9740168	So, and I've... And, well, I've tried... Tried calling the...
9743658	9746139	calling Blizzard about it, but here's the thing, though.
9746319	9750500	Trying to call the Blizzard line around these parts apparently seems quite hard.
9751040	9767184	And the irony is that I've managed to call the US one when I had problems with the... when I had problems at the time when I was playing World of Warcraft on US servers, then I got straight along.
9767664	9768304	And now it's like...
9769595	9772217	Yeah, you're out of luck or something.
9772377	9773038	Oh, well, anyway.
9773278	9775680	Has your WoW account been inactive for some time?
9776701	9781745	My WoW account, both of my WoW accounts have been inactive for like...
9784938	9787119	Did you have an authenticator on that account?
9787619	9788779	No, I did not.
9789060	9796102	Because the authenticator, when I played the authenticator, wasn't released yet.
9796423	9801064	It is possible, and I don't know, but it's possible that your account got hacked.
9801244	9810268	Because I have heard of people that even though they had inactive Warcraft accounts, that some people would go in there and reactivate them to get access to the characters.
9810328	9811949	It's crazy, crazy stuff.
9812549	9815910	Just hypothesizing that that could be what's screwing with you over there.
9816010	9821452	So, definitely, you're going to have to keep on Blizzard and, I guess, email if nothing else.
9821472	9822192	I don't know.
9822392	9825173	I will have to call them or something.
9825753	9842058	Because, well, but one of the problems that I have also is that, well, if I'm right, to be able to identify, well, I'm going to have to go find... The problem is also is that I need to find a scanner
9843255	9849800	or the scanner because I need to scan in my passport or something.
9851549	9861092	to send, well, to basically, like, made in a file and send it to them and say that, yes, this is me, of sorts.
9861352	9862413	What a pain.
9862453	9864373	Or are you just going to have to give him the angry Swede?
9864714	9867354	Sounds like this angry Swede's quite justified in his anger.
9867394	9869555	Yes, I wish you the best.
9869595	9871256	I wish there was a magic wand.
9871336	9873816	In that regard, I am quite pissed.
9874137	9877438	Oh, and also, because, well, and also, because, well...
9879289	9893128	StarCraft 2, and here's the other thing though, in a kind of way, I already know what happens in, because also the thing is, playing StarCraft, I wasn't that hyped for StarCraft 2 in a kind of way anyway, since, uh,
9893709	9903811	The thing that I did is that since I got the Collector's Edition, you have this special DVD of sorts when you get all the video frequencies from the game.
9903831	9906112	And I'm all like, yeah, let's watch this.
9906192	9909632	So, yeah, you just got spoiled the whole game.
9911673	9917234	Well, here's the other thing, though, and even more fun, is that, well, if I...
9918121	9942391	and especially actually in a kind of way since I'm like one of those players that played through the first StarCraft game were playing like code power overwhelming yes please which was that well god mode activated well Aki Ripper I wish I could fix it for you but it sounds like you're just gonna have to keep on Blizzard customer support but do let us know what happens okay buddy
9943191	9945152	Yeah, I'll keep you updated.
9945192	9946932	Alright, I hope you can get to the Zerging soon.
9947132	9947892	Alright, hang in there.
9948552	9949193	Take care, buddy.
9949773	9950053	Bye.
9951453	9952373	Alright, poor guy.
9953334	9955274	But hey, tough lesson for everybody.
9955454	9957435	Learn at Ake Ripper's expense.
9957595	9959695	Learn at the expense of the Swedes.
9960415	9964696	Don't forget your security question, because that sucks when that happens.
9964756	9970638	You gotta be very careful with that stuff, so make sure you will be able to remember it later on, or else you're gonna have
9971498	9985926	All those problems that Aki Ripper was talking about there Alright, well that is going to do it for Orange Laundry's phone calls tonight We're going to close up the Skype line I don't know, usually Loki is the collector of last minute stories I don't know if DarkSakura pulled anything I did You did?
9985966	9988087	Well DarkSakura, what do you have for last minute stories tonight?
9988288	9999854	Basically Canadians are luring game developers out of Alabama I didn't realize there was this whole avalanche of game developers in Alabama in the first place
10000185	10011675	Well, the province of Newfoundland and Labrador paid $300,000 to a Huntsville, Alabama video game development company so it could set up a studio in Canada.
10012516	10019561	It's Bittrap Studios Canada is doing multiplayer online games and wants some help.
10020642	10044018	They're hoping that it will infuse $1.6 million into the local economy I see, I knew those Canadians were up to no good It's an economic war that they're declaring, I see Time to start pouring your maple syrup down the sewers Dude, I'm from Alabama, so it was cool
10044873	10046536	I'm just, obviously, I'm teasing.
10046577	10047097	Come on.
10047759	10049322	We like our neighbors to the north, really.
10049843	10050183	Usually.

10051185	10051666	Most days.

10059380	10060000	No, there's nothing else.
10060020	10060260	All right.
10061600	10062241	I'm being a jerk.
10062701	10062941	All right.
10062981	10065322	That's going to do it for Orange Laundry Radio tonight.
10065642	10069103	It's about time for us to go around and wrap everything up and put the nail in the coffin of the show.
10069763	10071404	We're going to go around and get everybody's final thought.
10071444	10076285	But first, I have to thank our guests for being here tonight because they did great work, really did good work tonight.

10126869	10127890	So come on back sometime.
10127950	10128330	Yep, yep.
10128510	10129631	With this economy, you need it.
10130151	10134315	DarkSakura, I'm going to ask for your final thought tonight.
10134616	10135517	What is your final thought?
10139260	10141423	DarkSakura deserves our full sympathy.
10142083	10142944	It's been a rough week.
10143004	10143665	I want a cookie.
10143685	10144506	You need a hug.
10145367	10145867	And a cookie.
10146328	10147249	And a pony.
10147629	10148150	And a dinner.
10148370	10150072	I need to give our guests their final thought too.
10150152	10151393	Gary, do you have a final thought tonight?
10153879	10158283	It's been too long since I've done any console game or any computer game.
10158303	10159223	I need to get back into it.
10159243	10163467	It looks like things have taken quantum leaps from the last time I did this seriously.
10164147	10167290	I saw the screenshots of Arkham Asylum and was blown away.
10167911	10168951	I'm glad we could inspire you.
10169252	10169512	Yep.
10170613	10171854	Milo, you have a final thought tonight?
10172054	10187851	DC Online Wow I'm totally going to be there too Can't wait And my final thought is I think Pinkberry would make it all better I've never been there It's really good But sadly it's Sunday and they're not going to be open But anyway, tomorrow
10188311	10189452	Alright, that's it guys.
10189612	10190513	Have a wonderful week.
10190574	10192956	We will be back here next week to do it all over again.
10192996	10202206	Unfortunately, Loki's going to be out for a little while longer, but hey, DarkSakura and I are perfectly capable of holding down the fort, so tune in next week to see what the antics bring, and I've got duct tape.
10202446	10207352	We're going to have a co-host next week to fill in for Loki, so more on that next week.
10207372	10209114	We'll see you next week here at Orange Lounge Radio.
10209974	10211336	Oh, I almost forgot.
10211696	10214578	If you did enjoy our show, please tell two people about the show.
10214618	10218221	Help us spread the word because we're not a multi-million dollar organization.
10218261	10221444	We're excited when we have $10 in the budget to spend on a Facebook ad.
10222004	10225527	So we really, really can use your guys' help in helping us spread the word of Orange Launch Radio.
10225787	10226488	That's all we ask.
10226748	10227949	Alright, so we'll see you next week.
