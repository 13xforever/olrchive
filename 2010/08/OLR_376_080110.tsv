0	20180	Tonight, August 1st, 2010, a big MMO plans a free-to-play model, Valve accidentally
20180	29980	bans 12,000 players, and the creator of Ultima wins $28 million from his former company.
29980	35600	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge
35600	36600	Radio.
36600	41320	We are that program dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer
41320	42320	lifestyle.
42320	44980	We are that show where every gamer has a voice.
44980	45980	My name is Rob Roberts.
45980	50080	I'll be joining you over the next few hours here at All Games Radio, where we tape live
50080	55080	every Sunday night, www.allgames.com, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, 6 o'clock
55080	56400	Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.
56400	58740	Boy, we say a lot in this intro.
58740	62760	The consoling voice over there in the corner, also joining us over the next few hours, Dark
62760	63760	Sakura, Jamie Summers.
63760	67800	We're also into game and meat, because elk is really tasty.
67800	71480	I didn't know you were dining on meat this week.
71480	75360	Every so often I dine on the meat, but I do not necessarily chow on the cow, and I definitely
75360	76360	don't dine on the swine.
76360	78480	Chow on the cow and dine on the swine, alright.
78480	81280	Remember, I got that from Danielle back in the day.
81280	82280	Oh my gosh.
82280	83280	Yep.
83280	84280	Wow.
84280	86720	I don't chow on cow and I don't dine on swine.
86720	88280	She was crazier than Sarah Palin.
88280	89280	Alright.
89280	90280	Um.
90280	91280	Look.
91280	96920	Let me, let me move on to introducing guests, on to happier topics.
96920	100040	Let's talk about Loki is not here tonight.
100040	104400	Loki's not here, because this is the day that we knew was going to be coming for some time.
104400	108880	Loki's going to be out for a few shows, because Loki, Miss Loki, went into labor this morning
108880	110060	at 11 a.m.
110060	111060	That's all we know.
111060	112640	We don't have a lot of updates other than that.
112640	116920	The baby is not here, or at least the arrival has not been announced on Facebook, but if
116920	120400	I were Loki, I would not be running to Facebook to announce the birth first thing.
120400	127320	My guess is that they do have a tiny one right now, who is currently doing a lot of sleeping,
127320	128840	as is mommy.
128840	134800	So during sleep time, we should start seeing the messages, because the, the, the body goes
134800	138360	through quite a lot of hell in childbirth.
138360	139360	So uh.
139360	140360	Yeah.
140360	142160	Being born is hard work.
142160	144360	It's a lot of pushing.
144360	148840	Alright, uh, we're going to, uh, so we do have some guests here, because this all happened
148840	153080	this morning, we weren't really prepared to have another co-host come in.
153080	156680	We are going to have something a little more permanent, um, well, not, not permanent, because
156680	157880	obviously Loki's not being replaced.
157880	161600	God, no, he'll come back, uh, but you know, for about the next month or so, while Loki's
161600	166440	off being a daddy, uh, we'll have a more long-term co-host next week, uh, but for now, we have
166440	167440	some special guests.
167440	168440	I have a co-host, Rob.
168440	169440	What's that?
169440	170440	Where is it?
170440	172440	Ah, how your co-host fails.
172440	173440	Alright.
173440	175520	Next guest is turned for me.
175520	180320	Okay, the batteries are dying on the Dalek, that ought to tell you something.
180320	181320	No, it's not dying.
181320	183440	It needs to exterminate itself.
183440	185320	We do have some guests here in studio tonight.
185320	189360	Let's say hello first to, uh, and I, I've met both of these guests for the first and
189360	194360	second time tonight, so I apologize if I'm mispronouncing you, but you're Mila?
194360	195360	Myla.
195360	196360	Myla.
196360	197360	Myla Minoke.
197360	198360	How are you, Myla Minoke?
198360	203360	I am doing very well, my sir, and I'm glad to be your guest on the show.
203360	207800	We don't, wait, we're not hearing you at all, and I'm trying to figure out why.
207800	208800	Turn my mic.
208800	211360	See, Rob, you were afraid that my mic was going to be crappy.
211360	212360	What is going on?
212360	213400	Is this, is the switch on?
213400	214400	That's always a common mistake.
214400	215400	Yes.
215400	216400	Hello out there in Disneyland.
216400	217400	Much better.
217400	218400	Hello.
218400	219400	Yes.
219400	220400	First, first rule of radio, turn your mic on.
220400	221400	Yeah, turn my mic on.
221400	222400	So, yes.
222400	223400	Let's try this from the top.
223400	224400	Myla.
224400	225400	Hi there.
225400	226400	How are you?
226400	227400	I'm doing fantastic.
227400	230760	Um, I'm actually, I was actually turned onto the show by our wonderful, uh, intern, Dronami,
230760	235160	and I am, I guess I'm the sub-intern, I guess I count, as the sub-intern.
235160	236160	You're the intern's intern.
236160	237560	You're the, you're the intern's gopher.
237560	238560	Yeah, I'm the gopher.
238560	239560	You're the gopher.
239560	240560	Aw, dammit.
240560	244720	Now you, but you have a lot in common gaming-wise with intern Drew, right?
244720	245720	Yes.
245720	248360	What, you're, you, you described yourself to me as like a budget gamer.
248360	249720	That's the type of video games you're into?
249720	250720	Yes.
250720	253840	Um, if it costs less than ten bucks, I've usually either played it, played it or bought
253840	254840	it.
254840	255840	So.
255840	256840	Yeah.
256840	257840	I'm, I'm usually very much on the budget gaming.
257840	260880	So much so that my MMO of choice is RuneScape.
260880	261880	Why?
261880	263000	Cause it's free.
263000	265640	We have news about a free MMO tonight, a new one going free.
265640	267120	So we'll talk about that a little later.
267120	268120	Very much.
268120	271800	But also we had a very interesting, um, meeting you and I did.
271800	272800	Yeah.
272800	274000	Thanks to a particular somebody else in this room.
274000	275800	So let's get to him and then talk about the meeting.
275800	276800	Okay.
276800	277800	So let's introduce somebody else.
277800	279360	So we also have joining us tonight, Gary.
279360	280360	Yes.
280360	281360	Yep.
281360	282360	That's me.
282360	283360	How you doing, Gary?
283360	284360	Um, all right.
284360	285360	Glad to be here.
285360	286360	Yes.
286360	287360	He's a friend of Punk Night.
287360	288360	Yeah.
288360	290680	Everybody is so like, like randomly connected to OLR somehow.
290680	291680	I've got to forget this.
291680	294680	You might know me as Mindstorm or SMF 2045 online.
294680	295680	Okay.
295680	296680	Either one of those.
296680	297680	Right on.
297680	298680	Um.
298680	299680	That'd be smf.
299680	300680	Getting back.
300680	301680	Yeah.
301680	302680	Whatever.
302680	303680	It's an acronym.
303680	304680	I'll explain later.
304680	305680	I know.
305680	310000	But, um, trying to get back into console gaming after hiatus of several years, um, need to
310000	311000	get caught up.
311000	312000	He plays a lot of D&D.
312000	314520	I'm hoping we can talk about something you're into tonight.
314520	317480	Now, yeah, you, you confessed to me before the show that you're just, you're just kind
317480	320720	of here for the atmosphere tonight cause you don't really play a lot of console games or
320720	321720	PC games.
321720	322720	Right?
322720	323720	You play games.
323720	324720	Not entirely true.
324720	325720	Okay.
325720	326720	Okay.
326720	328680	I, well, I got the impression you're more of a games that involve more than six sides
328680	329680	on my dice.
329680	330680	Yes.
330680	331680	I'm a tabletop gamer.
331680	332680	Nothing wrong with that.
332680	336040	But thanks to Dark, Dark Sakura, I picked up SimCity 3 and when I get a, when I get a chance
336040	337040	to play it, I love it.
337040	338040	SimCity?
338040	339040	Sims 3.
339040	340040	Sims 3.
340040	341040	Sims 3.
341040	342040	Yes.
342040	343040	There was a SimCity 3.
343040	344040	I know.
344040	345040	But you mod them.
345040	348200	No, I left off SimCity a long time ago.
348200	349720	I just downloaded boob sliders.
349720	351040	Well, I do.
351040	353280	This isn't the first time I've met Gary.
353280	355920	The first time I met Gary was at Jamie's rock band party.
355920	356920	Oh yes.
356920	357920	Rock band.
357920	358920	The beer potluck.
358920	359920	Oh yes.
359920	360920	That was technically the beer potluck.
360920	361920	I don't remember the beer potluck.
361920	362920	When was that?
362920	363920	Your mic is dying.
363920	364920	I don't know.
364920	365920	Ouch.
365920	366920	My ears.
366920	367920	Jamie.
367920	368920	Okay.
368920	375280	So everyone was, I told everyone to bring beer so we could have a beer potluck and Gary
375280	377040	brought meat which was almost as good.
377040	378960	Yeah, because I don't drink.
378960	379960	No.
379960	385000	But, but, you know, we finally, I still have one Guinness left from that time, Rob.
385000	386000	One Guinness.
386000	387920	And I'm gonna drink the fuck out of that Guinness.
387920	391440	And you'll be able to skip a meal when you do because Guinness is liquid bread.
391440	392440	Oh, yummy.
392440	396840	But, but that's gonna be my celebration for being off Vicodin because my hand is fucked
396840	397840	up even more now.
397840	398840	Aw.
398840	399840	And by the way, thanks for the peach beer.
399840	400840	It was delicious.
400840	401840	Yes.
401840	402840	I couldn't.
402840	403840	You remember I couldn't drink the, the peach Lombek.
403840	404840	Oh yeah.
404840	405840	I gave it to her.
405840	406840	Nice.
406840	407840	It was wonderful.
407840	408840	I loved it.
408840	409840	Yeah.
409840	410840	So, um, so now for the story.
410840	411840	Yay.
411840	412840	Oh, story time?
412840	413840	Yes.
413840	414840	This is how we met.
414840	415840	Ashley.
415840	416840	Uh, Myla.
416840	417840	Yeah.
417840	418840	We, we skip names all the time.
418840	424880	So anyway, um, Gary tells me that on our way to Shule downtown that we're picking up somebody.
424880	431160	So I instantly am pounced, hugged by this person and I'm like, okay, hi, you're fun.
431160	432920	I instantly like you.
432920	436840	And then we, she's talking about playing DDR and I said, Oh yeah, I used to moderate on
436840	437840	DDR freak.
437840	438840	It was dark Sakura.
438840	446120	And she's like from orange lounge, you know, drew a funny small world in it.
446120	448000	So we both called him and left him.
448000	449720	Um, what the fuck voice messages?
449720	450720	Wait a minute.
450720	451720	Wait a minute.
451720	452840	Is tonight on OLR like Jew party?
452840	454360	Is that what this is tonight?
454360	455360	What's the matter?
455360	456360	I don't count.
456360	457360	Oh, okay.
457360	458360	Oh, I thought, Oh, I thought you.
458360	459360	Oh, okay.
459360	461840	Is it the people in this room are only half true.
461840	463720	There's only half Jewish.
463720	464720	Yeah.
464720	465720	I'm Jewish by proxy.
465720	466720	Okay.
466720	467720	All right.
467720	471160	So we have Jew, Jew by proxy, Jew in training and not Jew.
471160	472160	Okay.
472160	473160	And gay.
473160	476320	The short, the short word for not Jew is goi.
476320	478640	Well, welcome, welcome to the world.
478640	479640	Here's your Yiddish lesson.
479640	483800	I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, welcome to the world of oppressive of oppressed peoples.
483800	484800	Yes.
484800	486520	But, but I love, I love the Jewish people.
486520	490680	I would say I'm a, I'm a, like, I'm not a fag hag, but I'm a, I'm a Jew.
490680	491680	I'm a Jew hag.
491680	492680	I don't know.
492680	493680	What would you call it?
493680	496600	Like a, like somebody who likes to hang out.
496600	497600	You're a goi toy.
497600	498600	A goi toy.
498600	499600	There you go.
499600	500600	All right.
500600	501600	Don't mind us.
501600	505240	We're geeks, we're gamers and we're fun.
505240	506880	And, and very silly.
506880	511560	Honestly, guys, this is one of those weeks where I don't know why we're doing a show
511560	512560	tonight.
512560	513920	Like, why not?
513920	518400	I think it's because we need, we need this, Rob, for some reason, guys, like we decided
518400	522800	to do the, the trial Facebook ad campaign this week, which I'll talk about in a minute.
522800	525480	It's not, it's not a big deal, but you know, we're, we're trying to get word out there
525480	526860	more about the show.
526860	530080	And so we probably have some brand new people listening for the first time tonight.
530080	531080	We're sorry.
531080	535840	And I'm thinking to myself, apologies in advance, please go back in the archives and listen
535840	537560	like three 74 was a good show.
537560	541000	I'm glad that you have these numbers memorized because I sure as hell don't.
541000	542880	Hey, how do you know it's not going to be a good show tonight?
542880	543880	No, it'll be fine.
543880	549400	We're all like, and that being really fun, especially when we're completely just thrown
549400	550400	off our patterns.
550400	551400	Yeah.
551400	552400	Random is hilarious.
552400	555160	I think all of us tonight kind of collected, well, I can't speak for the guests, but I
555160	557240	know Jamie and I just kind of don't give a fuck tonight.
557240	558240	At least I don't.
558240	560760	I, you guys have me on the show, so I know you don't give a fuck.
560760	563760	You guys have me on the show, so it's proof you don't give a fuck.
563760	566760	I gave a fuck, but I don't remember who I gave it to.
566760	567760	Probably Dan.
567760	568760	That's dangerous.
568760	574280	But yeah, there was, um, we should probably get into the how was our weekend day and shit
574280	575280	because there was some stuff.
575280	578160	Well, technically it's how was your gaming week is how we start off.
578160	581800	But I know, I know you're dying to talk about why you're off.
581800	583280	I really don't have an excuse.
583280	585040	I'm just, I'm on the rag.
585040	586520	I'm on man rag tonight.
586520	587720	I don't know what you'd call that.
587720	589080	I have some Vagisil if you need it.
589080	590240	I don't need that.
590240	591240	That's for damn sure.
591240	592240	I just need some freshening, Rob.
592240	593240	Do you feel not so fresh?
593240	594240	We could get you a douche.
594240	597240	You know how, you're a douche.
597240	599240	Your face is a douche.
599240	600240	Ow.
600240	601240	You know how.
601240	602480	I'll friend your butt.
602480	605560	I know you, I know you know what I'm talking about.
605560	610560	You know how like, somebody will just tell you good morning and you'll want to be like,
610560	613760	why are you looking at me like that?
613760	616920	Although that makes it sound like it's about my relationship, but it's really, it's not
616920	618600	like my relationship is awesome.
618600	623160	I think Alan is the best thing ever, but I think everything else, everything else.
623160	624960	I want him to be my gay boyfriend.
624960	628080	But you're already, you can't have him, he's mine.
628080	629080	All right.
629080	630080	All right.
630080	635280	Well, anyhow, so, so I'm just, I don't know, I'm just being a bitch tonight.
635280	636840	What's, what's your excuse, DarkSaga?
636840	642120	Well, um, and I'm, I'm going to go into details, kind of details about this, just because it's
642120	647920	something that people, especially gamers with, who are stereotypically lazy gamers who eat
647920	651400	Cheetos and all kinds of crap, need to be freaking aware.
651400	655640	We don't know any of those, as I need chips during the show.
655640	656640	S-T-F-U.
656640	659480	Rob, you're eating something kind of healthy.
659480	660480	Kind of.
660480	663120	I had a banana for breakfast anyway.
663120	670720	My husband, Dan, age 34, went into the hospital Tuesday morning at a quarter after three for
670720	672720	congestive heart failure.
672720	674800	My husband is 34 years old.
674800	680920	This is something that you could die from or suffer massive damage to your other organs.
680920	685400	Eventually he was coughing up blood and feeling really short of breath.
685400	689840	He didn't have any of the pain or numbness, so thankfully his heart was in good shape.
689840	694800	Um, but he's, he went in early Tuesday morning and got to leave Friday afternoon or actually
694800	699160	more like Friday evening and, um, his blood pressure was super high.
699160	705320	Thankfully after numerous ultrasounds and x-rays and what give you rays and tests and
705320	711040	things and prodding, lots of prodding, um, he, um, they determined that all the rest
711040	716480	of him worked just fine and he didn't damage his organs and he could come home, but he's
716480	722200	on blood pressure medication now, quite a bit of it and, um, low sodium diet.
722200	725680	And this is just a word of warning, you know, Dan said that, you know, I'd been harping
725680	730040	on him, you've heard me harp on him, you know, people have been telling him and he just was
730040	733320	not ready to believe it until it finally happened to him.
733320	737800	And I warn everybody out there, and we've got someone in the room who's been through
737800	738800	the same, similar.
738800	744520	Yeah, mine wasn't quite as serious, but President's Day weekend this year actually, um, I was
744520	750480	at a game convention and I felt really sick, uh, to the point where I got stuck in the
750480	755880	lobby of the convention, uh, and paramedics came because I felt faint, didn't feel like
755880	760960	I could get up, um, missed a day at the convention because I was convalescing, managed to drive
760960	765640	back to Sacramento, but then that week, um, when I was going to bed one night, I started
765640	770000	feeling dizzy, my heart was racing and I thought I was going to black out, so I called 911.
770000	775440	They took me to the hospital and they told me that I had, I forget the exact medical
775440	779280	name, but it was basically a viral infection of the lining of my heart, but it gave me
779280	784300	very, very, very similar symptoms to congestive heart failure to the point where they gave
784300	788260	me a pamphlet on congestive heart failure, what to eat, what not to eat, how to take
788260	789260	care of yourself.
789260	794400	So I can relate to Dan's situation and I definitely feel for you, this is scary and thank God
794400	795400	you're getting through it.
795400	798400	Let this be a warning to everybody.
798400	799400	Mike.
799400	800400	I am talking on my mic.
800400	801400	It's, it's...
801400	802400	LA!
802400	803400	Your connection at the base is...
803400	804400	Okay, I'm holding it in.
804400	805400	I'm holding it in.
805400	806400	Yeah, I can hear you.
806400	807400	Okay.
807400	808400	Well, of course you can hear me.
808400	809400	Well, I mean through your mic.
809400	810400	Okay.
810400	814000	Anyway, um, let this be a warning to everybody that, you know, don't think this can't happen
814000	815000	to me.
815000	819920	I really, and, and I know, and again, it's like with Dan's situation, he wasn't ready
819920	823320	to change until he got slapped in the face with it.
823320	824320	Yeah.
824320	827120	I, I really warn everybody not to get to that point.
827120	831480	So, and you know, in my show Solidarity for Dance, since he's got to be restrictive, I'm
831480	835480	going back fully into my 70 to 80% raw food.
835480	837920	Um, I am going to stick with it.
837920	841320	I've bought dance pads so we can play DDR at home.
841320	842320	Nice.
842320	843320	Yeah, this, let this be a lesson.
843320	844320	Get this, get this.
844320	848240	I mean, you know, we used to, we've got tons of dance pads, but I found, um, uh, not Cobalt
848240	849240	Flux.
849240	850240	What are the other ones called?
850240	851240	Ignitions.
851240	852240	Ignition pads.
852240	856760	Three of them for, um, for $6 at the thrift store.
856760	858520	I don't know if they work, but they were in good shape.
858520	862120	I'm going to clean the crap out of them and I'm gonna make Dan play some Boom Boom Dollar
862120	863120	with me.
863120	864120	Yay.
864120	865120	Shoot.
865120	866120	But, um, that sounds awesome.
866120	867120	But that's what my week's been.
867120	873200	So really, um, as far as going into gaming, I ain't played shit except for Ragnarok Online,
873200	874560	which I'm playing again.
874560	879600	And really I played that because it's so freaking, it was so mindless that I could just play
879600	883400	in and not have to think because I wasn't able to sleep.
883400	888080	I went that first day on an hour and a half of sleep and did not go to bed until something
888080	892000	like I took, yeah, a little nap, which is my hour and a half of sleep.
892000	897920	And then I was up until like three in the morning and I was up again at nine the next
897920	898920	day.
898920	902680	And I just, it's been, I slept really funny.
902680	906400	And I've spent, I've never been so freaked out in my life, even though I knew he was
906400	911400	in good hands, you know, and this is the other thing too.
911400	915200	And you know, I know I'm probably going into a bit of personal detail, but I don't care.
915200	917240	I have a microphone and I'm going to use it.
917240	919880	Tonight's the feel good episode of OLR everybody.
919880	926720	Don't make me bust out the booze, Hila.
926720	933600	At any rate, um, the, uh, the way things were going, you know, Dan and I were talking about,
933600	937040	you know, we've been talking about having a kid, me and Dan, I know I've been forthcoming
937040	938040	on this, on the show.
938040	939800	Cause I'm going to totally get Matt to do a nursery.
939800	941200	Oh, mini Sakura.
941200	942200	Yay.
942200	946920	Is this a tangent where I can mention that Matt's nursery was actually on Game Informer,
946920	950440	which I guess is that a big blog or magazine?
950440	951440	I'm going to be honest.
951440	954320	Game Informer is the one that's the GameStop one.
954320	955320	Yes.
955320	956320	Okay.
956320	959400	So he was on that, but it had nothing to do with OLR.
959400	962520	They found his pictures on Flickr.
962520	967400	So just a heads up to everybody and not to get too tangenty from Dark Sakura's important
967400	970200	story, but, um, be careful what you put up on the internet.
970200	971520	I mean, obviously who cares about this?
971520	975720	This is a good thing for Matt cause it's kind of cute that people care, but be careful.
975720	978360	I will shove that iPhone sideways.
978360	979360	Yeah.
979360	981680	Sounds good to me.
981680	986080	Here's the thing, but whatever you put on like Flickr, public Facebook, public Twitter
986080	987880	can be picked up by like anybody.
987880	993640	However, you can, um, you can copyright the photos and then they have to pay you.
993640	997720	But in this case it's good news, but you just, you just gotta be careful what you put up
997720	998720	on the internet.
998720	1001960	Just if it hadn't been good news, you know, you want to be, you want to be careful.
1001960	1002960	Yeah.
1002960	1005120	Just be careful what you say on your Facebook accounts.
1005120	1009680	People have gotten fired from jobs because they said something their bosses didn't like.
1009680	1013480	That's why mine is fully blocked and I don't allow, I really don't allow photo tagging.
1013480	1016440	You know, if someone's tagged my stuff, I go look it up and I'll look at the stuff I
1016440	1017440	tagged myself.
1017440	1020760	Hate that Facebook does not let you approve what you get tagged in.
1020760	1023600	But nobody can see, nobody can see my stuff.
1023600	1024600	Okay.
1024600	1025600	Nobody who's not a friend of yours.
1025600	1026600	Yeah, exactly.
1026600	1027600	All right.
1027600	1028600	And I don't allow friend to friend viewing.
1028600	1029600	Mm hmm.
1029600	1030600	Understood.
1030600	1031600	Yeah.
1031600	1032600	Sorry.
1032600	1033600	Sorry Jamie.
1033600	1034600	Back to your traumatic week.
1034600	1035600	Yes.
1035600	1036600	So please share with us.
1036600	1037600	Anyway.
1037600	1040680	Well, you know, Dan and I were talking about having a kid and now I totally don't want
1040680	1044680	to really do it until I'm sure he's going to stick with, with this as much as I would
1044680	1050160	like when I want to make sure that, you know, and, and we were actually, the ironic thing
1050160	1054960	is that we were talking about that Tuesday, um, Monday during the day is, you know, how,
1054960	1056740	and I wasn't so much worried about him dying.
1056740	1059760	I was worried about him not being able to keep up with a kid, you know, cause Dan's
1059760	1065760	a big guy and now I'm actually worried about maybe, you know, him dying and I'm, you know,
1065760	1070060	I'm 30, I'm, I'll say right now, I'm 34 years old, you know, Dan and I are coming up on
1070060	1072440	our fifth anniversary on September 1st.
1072440	1078660	We've been together for almost 14 years as of January and you know, I've never thought
1078660	1081400	for an instant I was ever going to have to be without him.
1081400	1085560	So it was, you know, and not that I'm saying that I'm one of those, oh, I'll die if you
1085560	1090040	die, you know, or I can't go without you, I can't do anything by myself.
1090040	1092840	You know, I'm not that one of those type of, of people.
1092840	1095560	I would be okay.
1095560	1099480	I would be incredibly depressed, but I would be okay.
1099480	1102640	It's just that it's something that no one ever thinks about.
1102640	1108200	So I also say, you know, uh, people out there, if you have a significant other or someone
1108200	1114680	in your family that is at risk, you need to sit down and have the talk with them because
1114680	1118120	when they think it can't happen, it does.
1118120	1121760	And so, you know, even though we're being one of those game podcasts, yet another one
1121760	1126160	that doesn't actually seem to talk about games for 30 minutes, this is important because,
1126160	1130720	you know, if you are, you know, sitting there and you're, you're down in Doritos and maybe
1130720	1135320	you're a little bit fluffy, you know, chances are me too.
1135320	1140180	I think it's, you know, when it happens to all of us, I'm, I'm feeling a little fluffy
1140180	1141180	right now.
1141180	1145880	In fact, my grandpa, my grandma's got a refrigerator magnet says, I'm not fat, I'm fluffy, fluffy.
1145880	1147520	It's something that it's something to watch out for.
1147520	1151320	If you spend lots of time sitting, you know, I used to work in an office and, you know,
1151320	1152800	play games, didn't get much exercise.
1152800	1156280	It was a wake up call early this year.
1156280	1158520	Even if you're not, well, I don't know about that.
1158520	1162400	I don't know if I go that far, but I still want to borrow your Wii Fit.
1162400	1167760	Even if you're not fluffy, it just, you know, take time to just kind of evaluate, you know,
1167760	1177640	am I going outside enough, am I walking, am I maybe eating not so good as I could be?
1177640	1180420	The straight Cheetos diet is not necessarily good for him.
1180420	1186520	And this is, this is going to be our big thing is watch the refined carbohydrates, you know,
1186520	1187520	watch the processed foods.
1187520	1192400	Seriously, what, even if it says low sodium on the can, no, no, no, no, no, no.
1192400	1194160	If it's canned, it's got sodium in it.
1194160	1195160	It's not, yeah.
1195160	1198160	Almost all the processed soups have tons of sodium on them.
1198160	1202840	Like Dan's limited to 2000 calories, not calories, 2000 milligrams a day of sodium.
1202840	1205120	They put me on a low sodium diet too.
1205120	1207880	I can't eat anything in the canned soup aisle anymore.
1207880	1208880	It's way too salty.
1208880	1213320	I'm going to, even though dark soccer is giving you great advice and these are all important
1213320	1218160	things that you should consider, like I'm going to give you like a diet so easy anybody
1218160	1219160	can do it.
1219160	1222060	Like seriously, you don't have to, you don't even have to look at the back of a package.
1222060	1223060	This is it.
1223060	1224060	This is the diet.
1224060	1225060	This is the diet.
1225060	1226060	This is how it works.
1226060	1227060	It's called don't eat shit.
1227060	1231360	Well, yeah, that's a given, but you'd be surprised how hard that is sometimes.
1231360	1237680	You'd be surprised how much shit you're eating and I'm honest, I eat a lot of shit and I
1237680	1239200	really need to cut back on that.
1239200	1241720	I'm not, I don't, that was just mean.
1241720	1243800	I don't mean actual poop shit.
1243800	1249280	I mean crappy food, like McDonald's, Burger King, all that fast food crap.
1249280	1254080	You know, everybody knows you're not stupid people.
1254080	1256440	You know how to download a podcast on the internet.
1256440	1257840	You're not dumb.
1257840	1262240	You know what's good for you and what's not good for you and it's okay to indulge once
1262240	1263240	in a while.
1263240	1268240	God, I don't know where I would be in this world without chicken McNuggets, but you don't
1268240	1273200	order the 20 pack of chicken McNuggets and you don't do it every day for one person.
1273200	1274200	Get a happy meal.
1274200	1275200	Yeah.
1275200	1276200	You know, that's this.
1276200	1279020	You know, the other bit of advice I have with this, and Dan is thankfully learning this
1279020	1284840	now is just the eat when you're hungry, stop when you're not, not when you're full, when
1284840	1285840	you're not hungry.
1285840	1290440	And you also need to make sure you eat at regular intervals, breakfast, lunch, dinner,
1290440	1293400	and maybe a small snack in between, but don't eat super late and stuff like that.
1293400	1295400	I eat it eight times a day.
1295400	1297560	Yes, that's good if you eat small meals a day.
1297560	1300200	But I eat about 100 to 200 calories a pop.
1300200	1301200	There you go.
1301200	1302200	That's a small meal.
1302200	1305480	But as long as I stick with my mostly raw food, I don't have to track what I eat.
1305480	1307360	The one problem is that I don't get enough sodium.
1307360	1308360	Irony.
1308360	1310040	You have the opposite problem.
1310040	1311720	I have the opposite problem, yep.
1311720	1312720	Interesting.
1312720	1316480	Because I eat mostly fruits and vegetables and they're raw and processed.
1316480	1319840	If they're processed, it's because I threw them in my blender.
1319840	1321400	But I know you eat beef occasionally.
1321400	1322400	Sometimes.
1322400	1323400	Occasionally.
1323400	1324400	Sometimes.
1324400	1330880	So anyway, um, we're going to get back in the games here, but, um, just, uh, you know,
1330880	1334960	also I, this is important to say, there's nothing wrong if you are a little fluffy.
1334960	1335960	Everybody's a little fluffy.
1335960	1337200	It's in, it's fine.
1337200	1338200	It's American.
1338200	1339200	Somebody just...
1339200	1342120	Love yourself the way you are, but make sure that you pay attention to your health.
1342120	1343480	Just be fluffy and healthy.
1343480	1344480	Yeah.
1344480	1349160	You know, as one last little tangent, I was reading an article, something about, um, six
1349160	1356420	months ago, I think, that was about, um, comparing skinny people to technically overweight people
1356420	1362400	and how, um, a good number of people are, that are overweight are technically, um, in
1362400	1366760	better shape than the skinny people that was talking about actually, um, what they were
1366760	1373480	calling, um, low weight obesity, meaning that they had a higher range of, uh, fat to muscle
1373480	1375020	ratio than these other people did.
1375020	1376020	Never heard of that.
1376020	1377020	Low weight obesity.
1377020	1378020	Low weight obesity.
1378020	1380080	Let's go to our chat room.
1380080	1385000	You guys chat.orangelaungeradio.com where we like to leave, uh, leave, read comments.
1385000	1387000	See, I told you I'm out of it tonight.
1387000	1391320	As we do tape live on Sunday nights at all games radio, uh, Burr first comment tonight
1391320	1395240	in our chat room at chat.orangelaungeradio.com says, his diet plan is to play so much.
1395240	1396240	Wow.
1396240	1397720	You don't have time to eat shit.
1397720	1403000	Um, that's half true, but you'd be surprised how much shit you eat while you're sitting
1403000	1406400	there in front of a computer playing games, usually because it's convenient and convenient
1406400	1408640	food, convenient food is usually shitty food.
1408640	1409640	Anyway, I'm sorry.
1409640	1412320	I didn't mean to get on the health kick, but it is important.
1412320	1414320	Obviously bring it up once in a while.
1414320	1418440	And that when it hits you in the face like that is sort of like the best thing you can
1418440	1421520	do is share it with other people so that they learn from your issues.
1421520	1422520	True.
1422520	1423520	True.
1423520	1424520	No.
1424520	1425520	And we do reach a wide audience on this show.
1425520	1431080	So if we can save one other person from having to go to the hospital, then I was 20.
1431080	1432080	Your mic again.
1432080	1433080	Your mic's mad at you.
1433080	1434080	Okay.
1434080	1435080	Clearly.
1435080	1436080	I was, I was mad.
1436080	1437080	I got over being worried.
1437080	1443760	I was mad because honestly, who does he have to blame for, for what happened to him, himself?
1443760	1446680	When my genes get snug, who do I have to blame for that?
1446680	1447680	Well, it's okay.
1447680	1453320	Sometimes I have, you know, PMS to blame for that, but usually it's, it's me.
1453320	1455720	You know, we have to be responsible for ourselves.
1455720	1456720	Nothing.
1456720	1461560	Like all those morons out there who are out there suing McDonald's and shit because, oh
1461560	1464680	I ate your hamburgers and I got overweight, man.
1464680	1468360	Well, don't eat the damn food, stupid.
1468360	1470400	End of story.
1470400	1471400	You know?
1471400	1472400	So anyway, I'm sorry for going off that.
1472400	1473780	So how about my games, Rob?
1473780	1474780	How about your games?
1474780	1475780	You already mentioned games.
1475780	1476780	You didn't play a lot.
1476780	1481480	But Star Trek Online episode two came out, which I got, I, you know, my hand has been
1481480	1485920	killing me because, oh, on top of all this crap with Dan, my hand's infected.
1485920	1487920	When I move my finger, it squishes.
1487920	1488920	Ew.
1488920	1489920	That's not good.
1489920	1490920	That's really gross.
1490920	1491920	I'm going to the doctor tomorrow.
1491920	1495920	Anyway, so I couldn't really do much, but I did get to explore my ship.
1495920	1497560	They've expanded the ships.
1497560	1499440	I have an engineering deck.
1499440	1501600	I have captain's quarters.
1501600	1505520	I have a sick bay and a lounge and a ready room on my bridge.
1505520	1508180	See, I got to get into this online Star Trek.
1508180	1509180	This just sounds awesome.
1509180	1510180	It's beautiful.
1510180	1515120	But, so I didn't really get to do much except talk to my fleet mates and run around my ship
1515120	1516120	like a crazy person.
1516120	1517560	But it was really cool.
1517560	1522000	In Star Trek Online, do you ever get to eject the warp core breach or the warp core because
1522000	1523000	of a breach or whatever?
1523000	1524000	No.
1524000	1525000	Really?
1525000	1527800	But my friend told me today that they're going to be doing on-ship missions.
1527800	1528800	Yay.
1528800	1531920	So maybe you do have a warp core breach.
1531920	1533360	I meant eject the warp core.
1533360	1536840	Of course my mind goes to the drink automatically, but yeah, eject the warp core because of a
1536840	1537840	breach.
1537840	1538840	Because that was like every episode of Star Trek.
1538840	1539840	They had to eject the warp core.
1539840	1544960	You know, I did find that the warp core breach was a legitimate drink from the show and he
1544960	1547560	pulled it out in the same bowl and everything.
1547560	1548560	Cork did.
1548560	1549560	Good times.
1549560	1550560	Anyway.
1550560	1551560	All right.
1551560	1552560	Is that it for your gaming week?
1552560	1558560	Oh yeah, Dan's buddy Will started Crackdown 2, so we just kept making fun of the boss.
1558560	1560600	Going, shut up, dude.
1560600	1562400	We know.
1562400	1564720	So anyway.
1564720	1570340	My gaming week, you know, obviously I play a lot of Warcraft, as a chatter earlier said,
1570340	1573960	but yourself.
1573960	1577960	Our little raid group finally cleared the Trial of the Champion on 10man, which yes
1577960	1581160	I know is like behind where most guilds are at right now, but we just started raiding
1581160	1582480	like last month.
1582480	1583480	So shut up.
1583480	1584480	We're awesome.
1584480	1585960	So that was fun.
1585960	1590320	And other than that though, I've been trying to play games other than WoW, but I didn't
1590320	1591720	have a lot of success this week.
1591720	1593880	I did play some Game Room.
1593880	1596480	I played Frostbite on Game Room, which just came out.
1596480	1600040	That's an old, old, old school Atari 2600 game that I remember from when I was a kid.
1600040	1602240	We used to stay up and play that for hours.
1602240	1603320	And it's still kind of cool.
1603320	1607680	Although I think a lot of you that don't get the classic gaming thing will not get this
1607680	1610680	either, so I don't expect everybody to run out and download it.
1610680	1613840	But the cool thing about Game Room, again, you can demo everything for 10 minutes, which
1613840	1619240	is more than enough time to figure out if you like an old school arcade game or not.
1619240	1620840	I've also been playing more Puzzle Quest II.
1620840	1624760	I started the whole dang game over just so I could play as an assassin, because it seems
1624760	1628440	like it's so much easier to just cut through things left and right, or I should say poison
1628440	1633280	them to death, overload them with poison, as an assassin.
1633280	1636760	Before I was playing the paladin-y type of class, it was more of a defender, and it's
1636760	1638480	just like the matches went on forever.
1638480	1641120	But as an assassin, I'm just like cutting people left and right.
1641120	1642240	It's awesome.
1642240	1645960	And this time, I hope to not miss any side quests like I did the first time.
1645960	1648920	You know, that reminds me of when you were going around saying, bitch, I cut you.
1648920	1652280	Yeah, it's kind of like that, but now I'm Puzzle Quest.
1652280	1653280	New games this week.
1653280	1658720	I did check out just the demo for Hydro Thunder Hurricane, because I wanted to see, and Jamie's
1658720	1660440	yelling, it's awesome.
1660440	1662560	I actually didn't really agree with her.
1662560	1667000	I was just kind of like, eh, it's okay.
1667000	1671140	There's something about playing that game in a big old cabinet at the arcade with other
1671140	1676760	people that was much more fun to me than sitting at home in my chair playing it on my Xbox
1676760	1677760	controller.
1677760	1678760	I don't know.
1678760	1679760	I just wasn't feeling it.
1679760	1681400	The graphics didn't do it for me either.
1681400	1682560	It's just something about it.
1682560	1685840	Like I feel like it wasn't awesome.
1685840	1688560	But you know, again, I'm only playing a demo.
1688560	1690360	I'm not trying to review the whole game.
1690360	1693920	I'm just saying, was I sold on the game based on what I played?
1693920	1694920	Nah.
1694920	1697000	So I ended up passing on the full version.
1697000	1698000	You guys, Jamie's yelling.
1698000	1703480	She bought the full version, but she is not in a mic right now, so we can't hear her.
1703480	1705520	We can't hear you.
1705520	1707080	Let's see.
1707080	1708600	So what else did I play this week?
1708600	1712160	Sadly, I didn't play Starcraft 2, although it seems like everybody's been playing that
1712160	1715560	because I haven't picked it up yet.
1715560	1717520	It's too much money right now.
1717520	1722960	It seems to be all of it, most of you guys are talking about Starcraft 2, DC Universe.
1722960	1724880	DC Universe I'm excited about.
1724880	1727440	There's that new trailer out for DC Universe that looked pretty hot.
1727440	1729880	Do I have to interrupt?
1729880	1730880	What?
1730880	1734640	Dan got Starcraft 2 and it's gorgeous and the collection edition comes with all the
1734640	1735920	old versions.
1735920	1739580	And we did get Hydra Thunder Hurricane, except I can't play it right now.
1739580	1740580	And he loves it.
1740580	1741580	But he loved the old one too.
1741580	1742580	Really?
1742580	1743580	I don't know.
1743580	1744580	Maybe I was just in a bad mood.
1744580	1745580	You'll have to see the new levels.
1745580	1748560	The level in, I think it's in Turkey.
1748560	1751440	That's gorgeous.
1751440	1752960	There was some interesting mechanics with it.
1752960	1756400	Like I didn't like hate it, but I just was, you know, there's so much other games to play
1756400	1759920	right now that I wasn't like, ah, I want to drop 15 bucks on this, especially knowing
1759920	1761500	that the Castlevania game's out next week.
1761500	1765120	And I know I'm going to want that just based on what games I've liked historically.
1765120	1769040	The problem I think with the game so far is the way you unlock, is the way that you unlock
1769040	1772880	the levels because you have to keep playing and keep playing and earn credits and then
1772880	1775520	you unlock the levels and it's not as cool.
1775520	1781160	Um, other games I've been playing this week, uh, on the PC, I actually bought a game on
1781160	1783120	Steam called Rhythm Zone.
1783120	1790040	Uh, it was a $9 game that is basically Guitar Hero for your computer, but you use the keys
1790040	1791040	to play.
1791040	1795640	I believe you can plug in USB devices, but going to be honest, didn't really look into
1795640	1796640	that.
1796640	1798080	Uh, I just played it with a keyboard.
1798080	1801480	The thing about the game is that yes, it has a library of songs that it comes with, but
1801480	1807720	it also will make a note chart to any MP3 on your drive.
1807720	1812080	As you can possibly imagine, if you've ever played one of those DDR games that makes up
1812080	1816960	the steps to the music as it goes along, uh, usually the note patterns that show up kind
1816960	1822120	of blow and it's just like, let's bang on random keys to my MP3 collection.
1822120	1824360	That's really a more appropriate title for the game.
1824360	1829280	Um, the game is just a straight up jack of Guitar Hero, really doesn't add anything new
1829280	1834200	to the mix except for, ooh, I can bang random keys to my MP3s.
1834200	1840480	Um, also for some inexplicable reason, the screen likes to slowly rotate to the left
1840480	1841720	and to the right.
1841720	1845280	I don't know why, but suddenly like, you know, you're doing, like imagine if you were playing
1845280	1849000	Guitar Hero and then just suddenly the whole screen started to rotate to the left like
1849000	1850520	45 degrees.
1850520	1855280	You'd be like, what in the fuck, what kind of fuckery is this going on right now?
1855280	1857960	And that's kind of exactly what was going on in Rhythm Zone.
1857960	1862560	So um, I really didn't like it, I'm sorry to say.
1862560	1867080	So I would say keep your $9 and just play more Alien Swarm, honestly.
1867080	1873880	Um, as much as I love Misa music games, and I guess the one nice thing I could say about
1873880	1880960	it is that it does seem like they have saved room to expand the game later on, so as long
1880960	1885400	as they don't make me pay for any of those expansions, because $9 is already too much
1885400	1892120	for what I got, that might be redeeming, but I'm not going to hold my breath.
1892120	1894760	Yes, that's Rhythm Zone on Steam.
1894760	1895760	Not a fan.
1895760	1896760	Okay.
1896760	1902880	Uh, let's see, that otherwise is pretty much it, especially as far as new stuff goes, didn't
1902880	1904520	really play a whole lot of other new stuff.
1904520	1909040	So I'm going to turn it over to Myla, have you been playing anything this week, New World?
1909040	1913600	Not only am I playing, have I been playing something, but I am playing something currently,
1913600	1919520	RuneScape, it's my new crack, well it's my old crack, I've been a member of this wonderful
1919520	1924240	game for, wow, since 1998.
1924240	1926840	We're not hearing you very well, make sure that mic's good, there you go.
1926840	1927840	Is it up?
1927840	1928840	Yay, yay, it's up.
1928840	1934400	Um, I've been playing RuneScape since 1998, I was a member, er, not a member, but a free
1934400	1941280	player back when the wilderness was PvP, what a concept, um, and then they switched it over
1941280	1946160	to PvP servers, which just made a lot of us just very unhappy.
1946160	1951120	Um, but then they released, about a year ago, they released the engineering skill, which
1951120	1956720	is what I'm working on right now, and it just, it brings a whole new level to the game.
1956720	1960480	It's, you know, originally RuneScape was, you know, something you played on the weekends
1960480	1964480	when you're bored and didn't have really anything to do, and, you know, you do one skill and
1964480	1969520	then you do another skill, and it's just kinda, you know, kinda monotonous kind of stuff and
1969520	1974000	it's really fun and, but now that the engineering skill's out, it's amazing because you can
1974000	1980040	use your regular skills that you get naturally through the game as a window into the new
1980040	1985880	skill, which is great, because, um, you use your magic skill for your magic-based attacks
1985880	1989240	just like you would in a regular game, but you also use your crafting skill to make new
1989240	1995240	armor, and you jump into the dungeoneering levels with no equipment.
1995240	2001080	You build your own equipment, you build your own things, everything that you do in the
2001080	2004880	dungeoneering is based off your regular stats.
2004880	2010200	And it's amazing because it really, you know, for those people like me who spent the, you
2010200	2017040	know, umpteenth million plus hours of, uh, of, you know, doing the skills, it actually
2017040	2021080	is a benefit because now I can, you know, waltz into a dungeon, beat a whole bunch of
2021080	2026040	bad guys, level up my armor, and keep going.
2026040	2032800	The only bad part I find with the skill is that when you, because it's one to four players,
2032800	2037640	it's one to four player group teams, you know, like a raiding party.
2037640	2042680	When you're soloing, it's a little more difficult, but you get more of the feel of the skill.
2042680	2047480	When you're doing the four member parties, especially in the earlier levels, it really
2047480	2051560	feels like you're just running in a dungeon, wasting everything, and keep going.
2051560	2056360	You know, you're maybe at the boss for like maybe, you know, fifteen seconds.
2056360	2060640	That sounds like playing a PSO back in the day.
2060640	2065520	But you know, as you go down into the levels, you know, the skill increases.
2065520	2067360	But therein lies the problem.
2067360	2074200	Whenever you start a dungeoneering level, it takes how many people are going in, and
2074200	2078280	then from there, it determines which level you start in.
2078280	2085040	So if you've been soloing for a long time, you'll be at like level fourteen, and you
2085040	2087960	know, the dungeons will be really harder, but if you don't do a lot of the four mans
2087960	2091800	or three mans, you'll be stuck at like the first couple of levels, and you'll be going,
2091800	2093000	where's the challenge?
2093000	2094000	What's going on?
2094000	2095000	Everything's easy!
2095000	2096200	What the hell?
2096200	2100080	So it's a little different, but it's really fun.
2100080	2101080	It's really, really fun.
2101080	2102800	Now RuneScape's been around since ninety-eight?
2102800	2103800	Yes.
2103800	2104800	Oh my gosh.
2104800	2105800	It's been around forever.
2105800	2110360	Have they done like major makeovers to it since then?
2110360	2116040	It's one of those things, RuneScape, it's been slowly evolving over the years, you know.
2116040	2119720	They'll release a patch here, a patch there.
2119720	2127680	Dungeoneering's really the first full world patch and update that they've done in literally
2127680	2129680	years.
2129680	2134440	You know what's funny is that a lot of people are talking Starcraft 2 this week, and what's
2134440	2139780	funny about Starcraft 2 is that it's an upgrade to a game that is about ten years old, what
2139780	2141880	Starcraft 1 came out what, ninety-nine?
2141880	2142880	Yeah.
2142880	2146680	And there were still people playing that, well there were people still playing it today
2146680	2147680	probably that haven't got the new one.
2147680	2148680	But people are still playing Diablo.
2148680	2155360	Oh yeah, I mean that's just as old too, so I mean, it's kind of funny to think, are you
2155360	2156360	playing RuneScape right now?
2156360	2158840	Yeah, I'm playing RuneScape right now and I'm just about to die.
2158840	2163200	But the good news is if you die in the Dungeoneering skill, they just pop you back to the homeworld.
2163200	2168680	You know, the only thing that death in Dungeoneering really accomplishes is, yes, you get a sucky
2168680	2169680	score at the end.
2169680	2171680	That's about all it does.
2171680	2176560	Now there's some folks in chat, I see DrewNami's in chat and he's saying RuneScape with kind
2176560	2180720	of one of those like, you know, whatever faces.
2180720	2184420	I don't think he's a fan of RuneScape, but it's free, right?
2184420	2185420	It's free.
2185420	2187180	That's one of the big puzzles.
2187180	2188340	Is it better than Yaris?
2188340	2190000	It's got to be better than Yaris.
2190000	2191000	Alright.
2191000	2197320	Rob, my cat's stinky butt is better than Yaris.
2197320	2200380	Tigerclaw in our chatroom says, Starcraft 2 is a huge graphical upgrade.
2200380	2202160	It's no longer the pixelated graphics.
2202160	2203160	Everything is all 3D graphics.
2203160	2204160	Oh yeah, yeah.
2204160	2208120	Oh no, all the cinematic areas are in game, are real time.
2208120	2212520	No, no, and I understand that, but my point was is that, you know, RuneScape, yeah, it's
2212520	2215920	from 98 and people are still playing it today, which might seem weird, but I was just saying
2215920	2220560	like, Starcraft was out only one year later than that and hell, people are still playing
2220560	2221560	that.
2221560	2223520	I've been playing Ragnarok online since 97.
2223520	2226820	Oh my, is that game really that old?
2226820	2227820	Pretty old.
2227820	2228820	I can double check.
2228820	2231520	Because I knew it was out in Korea before that and I was playing on the Japanese servers
2231520	2232520	for a little while.
2232520	2233520	Interesting.
2233520	2238400	And then I was playing on the open beta for IRO.
2238400	2239400	Old games.
2239400	2240400	Alright, Mila.
2240400	2241400	Still playing it too.
2241400	2244240	Anything else you want to give a shout out to in a game you released here?
2244240	2249200	Well, hey Drew, other than that, nah, not really.
2249200	2253080	I'm literally in the middle of a dungeon right now and I'm kind of milling through it, so.
2253080	2254840	Alright, we'll try not to suck up all our bandwidth.
2254840	2255840	Alright.
2255840	2256840	I won't.
2256840	2257840	I know.
2257840	2258840	I won't.
2258840	2261520	Gary, now I know you said beforehand you weren't too much of a console or, well no, now you
2261520	2262920	might be a PC gamer, I'm here.
2262920	2268600	Well, I used to be console, I grew up with an 8 and 16 bit Nintendo, Final Fantasy, original
2268600	2271120	Final Fantasy, awesome.
2271120	2278360	I have a Playstation 2 that hasn't seen much use lately, more as a DVD player than a game
2278360	2279360	console.
2279360	2286840	But I get back into it and I picked up a couple of computer games and I always actively look
2286840	2290040	for interesting looking computer games.
2290040	2293360	I'm seriously looking at Batman Arkham Asylum.
2293360	2295520	That game is great.
2295520	2298280	Okay, another recommendation.
2298280	2301200	The reviews seem to be glowing all around, so it's probably something I'm going to have
2301200	2302200	to pick up.
2302200	2304600	If you like the Batman universe, it's, you know, they've got a lot of the voice actors
2304600	2308520	from the animated series and, you know, it's good.
2308520	2315080	Well, I'm watching the DC Universe Online trailer and it looks pretty awesome, at least
2315080	2316840	what they put together here.
2316840	2317880	It was very epic.
2317880	2319360	I did watch that earlier this week.
2319360	2323040	I'm really jazzed about DC Universe Online, I think it's going to be great.
2323040	2325320	The graphics look pretty crazy and awesome.
2325320	2330080	Yeah, I think my favorite part of that whole trailer was the part where Joker's about to
2330080	2333160	shoot the bazooka and Harley's literally holding him on the side of the building.
2333160	2334160	Yeah, I saw that.
2334160	2336160	Probably trying to drag him back.
2336160	2337160	Good times.
2337160	2342600	If you want to comment on anything we're talking about tonight, chat.orangeloungeradio.com is
2342600	2347240	the place to be or on the Game Surge Network, we are in channel Orange Lounge.
2347240	2348840	We don't use the regular all games chat room.
2348840	2349840	I don't know why.
2349840	2353600	It's just we always had a separate room and that way when we have a separate room, we're
2353600	2355680	in control and have ops and all that stuff.
2355680	2356680	We're just control freaks.
2356680	2362560	Alright, um, let's see, so, um, I was going to ask you about tabletop games.
2362560	2366160	I know we don't talk a lot about tabletop games, but briefly, what types of tabletop
2366160	2367160	games do you play?
2367160	2373200	Um, Dungeons and Dragons, 4th edition, okay, okay, stop with the booze, stop with the booze.
2373200	2374200	It's not bad.
2374200	2378320	You can do anything, just about anything in 4th edition you can do into previous ones.
2378320	2381840	I'm clueless when it comes to this stuff because I haven't played D&D in a while.
2381840	2386320	Why, I played a little bit like two years ago, but that maybe lasted a month.
2386320	2388920	Why are people so mad about 4th edition?
2388920	2391520	Because it's a genre shift.
2391520	2396720	Previous editions of D&D were high fantasy, lots of powerful spells.
2396720	2400520	You got them fairly early on in your character's career.
2400520	2406320	4th edition, you aren't flying until you're in the teen levels.
2406320	2411880	The teleportation is line of sight, very short distances, um, but you know, that's, it's
2411880	2412880	not bad.
2412880	2415840	It's, you just gotta give it a try.
2415840	2420040	The teleporting in previous editions, especially in 3rd, was crazy.
2420040	2425000	It got to the point where a party would teleport, would scry, teleport, and kill the main boss
2425000	2430320	and that was your whole campaign in the teen levels, and of course 3.5 D&D tended to break,
2430320	2435800	the entire system broke around 16th to 18th level, um, because they just hadn't, it was
2435800	2436800	a design thing.
2436800	2441400	Yeah, what it kind of reminded me of was the difference between, you know, wow in the early
2441400	2445160	levels is, you know, kind of alright, you know, you're not, you know, you don't have
2445160	2448160	a lot of things, but you can still, you know, level up pretty quickly.
2448160	2453120	You know, with 4th ed, it almost reminds me of the first couple levels of Final Fantasy
2453120	2454120	11.
2454120	2456120	Until you get to 10, you're crap.
2456120	2457120	Yeah.
2457120	2463360	One of the big misconceptions about 4th edition is it's, it's like a, it's an MMO on tabletop.
2463360	2464960	No it's not an MMO on tabletop.
2464960	2468800	Yes, they share terminology with World of Warcraft.
2468800	2474640	It makes it convenient, but you can still do, this is not a ding on, on computer console
2474640	2478480	games, but you can still do more because you have a living person who can keep making up
2478480	2479480	the story.
2479480	2481000	You're only limited by your imagination.
2481000	2482000	Yes, exactly.
2482000	2483000	Whereas, you know.
2483000	2484880	And a good DM knows what rules to edit.
2484880	2485880	That's right.
2485880	2489680	Well yes, and you know, house rules in a, in a home game is the name of the game.
2489680	2496520	So I mean, you can change the system to a point, if there's something that somebody
2496520	2497840	wants to do.
2497840	2500240	You know, it's just, it depends on what you like.
2500240	2503980	I mean, people who don't like 4th edition go play Pathfinder, that's fine.
2503980	2504980	No problem there.
2504980	2509900	I'm glad Taizo was around to put out an alternative for the folks that didn't like the genre shift.
2509900	2512680	But I enjoy 4th.
2512680	2518800	I'm hoping that they'll license or put out a computer game based on the 4th edition rules
2518800	2524080	but I know Wizards of the Coast was having some issues with Atari as their game publisher.
2524080	2527400	I don't know if those got worked out yet or not.
2527400	2533600	But I like 4th edition, I also like hero games, superheroes, champions.
2533600	2535920	I play champions.
2535920	2539940	Champions is fun but it's a very, very hidden numbers heavy game.
2539940	2546000	I'm not a math guy so I need a character generator to keep the stuff straight but eh.
2546000	2553320	You know, I haven't played the champions online MMO, I'm told it's very different in its mechanics
2553320	2557800	and they just licensed, actually they bought the champions name from hero games and then
2557800	2559480	licensed it back to them.
2559480	2560480	It's an interesting arrangement.
2560480	2561480	Ooh, amazing.
2561480	2568160	Yep, I talked to Steve Long, one of the hero lead designers at length, well actually not
2568160	2573880	at length briefly, at the last convention I was at, I think that was Kublai Khan or
2573880	2581120	Dunder Khan in February and he explained how that worked out, it's kind of interesting.
2581120	2587860	But yeah, they got 6th edition hero now is the current edition of that and I have yet
2587860	2592560	to play it but I'm looking forward to doing something different than D&D very soon.
2592560	2597000	I've been playing Dungeons and Dragons since 3rd edition came out, pretty much uninterrupted
2597000	2598000	straight.
2598000	2599000	Wow.
2599000	2600000	Dedication.
2600000	2602600	You kind of get tired of it after a little while.
2602600	2606760	I just, it's the fantasy thing, I'm ready for a genre shift myself.
2606760	2609160	I want to do a nice steampunk game.
2609160	2612140	Let me get to some comments from our chatroom at chat.orangetonstrategy.com, without turning
2612140	2615480	into a tabletop gaming show, although it is important, you know, a lot of computer games
2615480	2619440	we play today are inspired, like champions online is a perfect example, directly inspired
2619440	2621140	by the tabletop universe.
2621140	2623700	Well without D&D you wouldn't have World of Warcraft.
2623700	2625000	No way.
2625000	2626920	Or probably even stuff like Final Fantasy.
2626920	2627920	Nope.
2627920	2632160	Let's see, comments from our chatroom at chat.orangetonstrategy.com, Shauran says that's not why 4th edition
2632160	2633160	isn't as good.
2633160	2635440	It's not as good because there's next to no customization.
2635440	2636440	That's not true.
2636440	2637440	Oh boy.
2637440	2638440	Alright.
2638440	2640440	How about we save the debate for another time.
2640440	2641440	Alright, yes.
2641440	2644520	Monty Boggs says, none of my group wants to spend money on the new books, so we haven't
2644520	2646520	upgraded.
2646520	2650500	Shauran clarified though, at least in terms of skills and multi-classing.
2650500	2651500	That's also...
2651500	2653500	No fan of the Flames.
2653500	2658100	I will leave it at this, I still love 2nd edition for a reason.
2658100	2659100	Take your THAC0 and shove it.
2659100	2660100	Yes I have.
2660100	2662920	Hey, I can calculate my THAC0 in my sleep, sir.
2662920	2666000	THAC0 and low saving throws, high attack rolls, yes.
2666000	2670400	Camara says, the 4th edition book talked down to me like I was a child.
2670400	2673280	This is what the dice looks like, this is how you roll it.
2673280	2676120	Yeah, that's a problem I've always had with Wizards of the Coast.
2676120	2678240	They don't write very well.
2678240	2680320	The game books aren't written very flavorfully.
2680320	2681880	We miss you TSR.
2681880	2685440	Yeah, well actually, that's one thing I like about White Wolf.
2685440	2691560	At least the old World of Darkness, the vampire, the werewolf books were written very flavorfully.
2691560	2694720	You actually could feel the world when you were reading it.
2694720	2698320	Yeah, and then they switched to New World and there was much sighing and...
2698320	2699320	We won't talk about New World.
2699320	2700320	We don't talk about New World.
2700320	2701320	Gnashing of teeth.
2701320	2703120	We don't talk about New World of Darkness.
2703120	2704840	It's a scientist left in the closet.
2704840	2707320	We just made GFD happy because we're talking about New World of Darkness.
2707320	2711440	I'm pleasantly surprised at what a warm reception the tabletop chat is getting from our chat
2711440	2712440	room.
2712440	2715520	It seems to have a tabletop corner or something in the future, I don't know.
2715520	2716520	Alright.
2716520	2717520	I'll do it.
2717520	2718520	Yeah, TSR is dead.
2718520	2722160	They died of their own money grubbing but unfortunately it looks like Wizards of the
2722160	2723680	Coast might be going the same way.
2723680	2724680	Eh, that's life.
2724680	2727880	Alright, let's get into some housekeeping here so we can get to the video game news
2727880	2728880	of the week.
2728880	2731240	Housekeeping going on here at Orange Lounge Radio.
2731240	2735280	I mentioned a Facebook ad campaign earlier and just to tell you guys what's going on,
2735280	2740100	it doesn't really directly affect the show but we decided to try a little something something.
2740100	2741600	We don't make any money doing OLR.
2741600	2742960	I want to make that very clear.
2742960	2743960	We don't have ads during the show.
2743960	2744960	We don't have any on the site.
2744960	2745960	Money?
2745960	2746960	Really?
2746960	2747960	I know.
2747960	2750320	We don't make, we haven't for eight years made money doing OLR.
2750320	2755120	So the only exception would be like donations which we, we don't actively solicit them at
2755120	2756120	all.
2756120	2758440	We don't have like a PayPal link or anything but you know, folks in the past have donated
2758440	2763700	generously to the show and you know, that's kept us definitely going via bandwidth, time,
2763700	2764700	whatever it is.
2764700	2766460	Not necessarily just money.
2766460	2769520	But we decided what the hell, let's take you know, ten bucks.
2769520	2773660	We can find ten bucks and see what happens if we throw it into a Facebook ad campaign.
2773660	2777640	And so thanks to any of you new guys we got from that.
2777640	2783320	I know it, it, you know, it got us a little bit of extra exposure so we're thinking about
2783320	2784720	doing more stuff like that in the future.
2784720	2785720	I don't know.
2785720	2786720	Exposure, exposure, exposure.
2786720	2788320	We'll see.
2788320	2789760	So maybe more of that in the future.
2789760	2790760	I don't know.
2790760	2795400	But do join our Facebook community if you're not already on there, www.facebook.com slash
2795400	2797320	Orange Lounge Radio.
2797320	2798320	We're also on Twitter.
2798320	2799320	We'll be taking Twitter topics later.
2799320	2800920	We're also on Twitter.com slash O-L-R.
2800920	2801920	Alright.
2801920	2805480	So, that's all I have for Housekeeping tonight.
2805480	2807400	So why don't we get into some actual gaming news?
2807400	2808400	Yay!
2808400	2813680	We're going to start off tonight with a story on Starcraft 2.
2813680	2817160	Starcraft 2 obviously is the big thing in gaming this week, although I personally have
2817160	2818160	not played it.
2818160	2820960	You've definitely heard some comments from chatters and Jamie watching Dan play and some
2820960	2821960	other stuff.
2821960	2823800	Exactly how big was Starcraft 2?
2823800	2831760	Well, according to a report at vgcharts.com, Starcraft 2 sold 1.8 million copies on day
2831760	2832760	one.
2832760	2834760	That's not counting Korea, just so you know.
2834760	2835760	That's not counting Korea?
2835760	2836760	Not counting Korea.
2836760	2837760	Okay.
2837760	2840520	So, 1.8 million on the first day.
2840520	2843200	That's Americas and Europe.
2843200	2847000	Keep in mind though, I want to say, didn't World of Warcraft sell a little more?
2847000	2851140	It's for, not original wow, but like Wrath of the Lich King sold what, like 2.8 I think
2851140	2852140	on day one?
2852140	2853140	Yeah.
2853140	2855560	Do you have some other numbers for context of that?
2855560	2858640	I want to say World of Warcraft Wrath of the Lich King, yeah.
2858640	2863160	It's here later in the story, 2.8 million units on day one as well, and that's another
2863160	2864160	Blizzard game.
2864160	2865280	But here's the difference.
2865280	2871800	With an MMO, especially one like wow, there's this huge need to be the first person on the
2871800	2874000	server at level 80, you know what I mean?
2874000	2877080	So there's a lot of people who want to go out and get it right away.
2877080	2880560	Starcraft 2 I think is a little different because I don't think everybody needs to jump
2880560	2881560	on board with that.
2881560	2885320	You can jump in right away, but you know I was lining up, well I didn't actually, I didn't
2885320	2889040	line up for Wrath of the Lich King, I just went and got it the next day.
2889040	2892280	But there's a lot of people I think that are just kind of chilling with Starcraft 2, like
2892280	2893280	they don't have to get it right now.
2893280	2894280	Yeah.
2894280	2897560	They can wait a little bit, or at least for a price drop, but then again, with Blizzard,
2897560	2898560	good luck.
2898560	2899560	Yeah.
2899560	2900560	Good luck on that.
2900560	2901560	They're still charging 20 bucks for Diablo 2.
2901560	2906640	Yeah, I never heard anyone stressing over missing a raid in anything but World of Warcraft.
2906640	2915240	Yeah, as far as the original Starcraft goes, I actually got my copy from a friend who actually
2915240	2921100	bet me money for whether or not I could beat him at Starcraft.
2921100	2925240	And I didn't know the game, so he's like, here you borrow my copy.
2925240	2928800	And then I played Zerg and whipped him good, so that teaches him.
2928800	2933880	I'm watching the trailer for Starcraft 2, Wings of Liberty, Ghosts of the Past.
2933880	2934880	Looks intriguing.
2934880	2938400	Wow, that's an interesting monster.
2938400	2939960	Hurry for the Zerg.
2939960	2941320	Hurry for the Zerg.
2941320	2945440	I don't know how I feel about this whole splitting it up into three games, though, because really,
2945440	2946760	you know, I don't know.
2946760	2947760	It's...
2947760	2954720	Well, even for splitting it up into three games, you know, they still gave some outrageous
2954720	2959560	additions to some of the other, you know, like the Zerg, like the Protoss, you know,
2959560	2963680	the exploding Zerglings I absolutely love.
2963680	2968400	I don't know enough about the Starcraft universe to even profess to say, oh, this is a good
2968400	2973400	idea or no, but I kind of think, like, okay, kind of going from that wow fanboy perspective
2973400	2976840	of maybe these are more like expansion packs.
2976840	2981400	These future releases are kind of like expansion packs in a way, but they're also standal...
2981400	2985440	Because, like, I could totally just skip this game and buy the Zerg game, right?
2985440	2987520	Because the next one's the Zerg game.
2987520	2988520	And then I could just...
2988520	2989520	Oh, the next one is the Zerg.
2989520	2990840	I believe the next one's the Zerg game.
2990840	2993280	And then I could just Zerg all night and all day.
2993280	2994280	All day.
2994280	2996440	And still do multiplayer like everyone else, right?
2996440	2997440	Mm-hmm.
2997440	2998440	Yeah.
2998440	2999440	Interesting.
2999440	3000440	Very much so.
3000440	3004400	It's a strange experiment they're trying, and it's getting them a lot of crap.
3004400	3007680	You know, there's a lot of people really pooping on Starcraft 2 because of the whole lack of
3007680	3009480	land support, but that's...
3009480	3010480	I hate to say it.
3010480	3012480	I think it's more of a vocal minority than anything else.
3012480	3013480	Yeah.
3013480	3014880	I don't think it's anything to take.
3014880	3015880	Yeah.
3015880	3016880	The...
3016880	3020120	Some of the, you know, looking at all the additions of what they made from the original
3020120	3027400	game to the new game, it really makes each of the races a little more versatile.
3027400	3032040	Because with the original Zergs, you really only had one option.
3032040	3033040	Zerg Rush.
3033040	3034040	That was it.
3034040	3042160	That was the only way to really make a dent into the opposing sides and to really thrive
3042160	3043600	was just Zerg Rush.
3043600	3045560	And that was really your only tactic.
3045560	3053680	With the new additions that they have, like the Explodes, Zerg lingo boom, is...
3053680	3059840	It makes for a really interesting new way of playing for those people who are just used
3059840	3065960	to one style for, you know, for, you know, the individuals like the Protoss, like the
3065960	3066960	Terrans.
3066960	3070520	Well, stepping away a little bit from the gameplay for a minute here to talk numbers
3070520	3074960	again, because I think this is very interesting and could be very telling for the future.
3074960	3081520	Now again, this report on VGcharts.com is estimating that 31% of those units were sold
3081520	3083520	on Battle.net.
3083520	3089680	Meaning that about a third was all digital distribution directly through Battle.net.
3089680	3091360	That could be very...
3091360	3094200	It's almost a telling sign of where GameStop's gonna be in 10 years.
3094200	3098640	So do you think DVDs, games on DVD, CD are gonna be obsolete and you just download it
3098640	3099640	in the future?
3099640	3103400	How long do you think it's gonna take, because obviously it is gonna happen.
3103400	3106320	Well, have CDs gone obsolete yet?
3106320	3107320	No, not yet.
3107320	3110120	They've had unexpected longevity somehow.
3110120	3114160	They've been punched and kicked and throttled and had their hair pulled.
3114160	3115160	Pretty much.
3115160	3116160	But they're not dead yet.
3116160	3117160	And I think...
3117160	3118160	They're not dead yet.
3118160	3119160	CDs are...
3119160	3120160	They're not getting better though.
3120160	3124240	CDs are kind of where, right now, I think you can kind of look to that to see a little
3124240	3125720	bit about where gaming's going.
3125720	3128280	Well, here's my parallel.
3128280	3129640	Newspapers and online.
3129640	3130840	Yes.
3130840	3134880	Super circulation is down so far, so fast.
3134880	3136560	Newsweek is up for sale.
3136560	3137560	But they're not all dead yet.
3137560	3138560	No, they're not all dead yet.
3138560	3142600	And major dailies are hurting, like the Washington Post and the New York Times, but they're not
3142600	3143680	gone.
3143680	3145080	So we'll see what form they take.
3145080	3149480	The iPad might have something to say about what form they take in the future.
3149480	3150480	We'll see how that goes.
3150480	3152600	Or the Amazon Kindle.
3152600	3154320	The Kindle, yes.
3154320	3156080	And also Sony has another e-reader.
3156080	3157080	I forgot what it was called.
3157080	3158760	Sony's e-reader's actually really, really nice.
3158760	3159760	Okay.
3159760	3160760	I've never seen it, so I don't know anything about it.
3160760	3162240	One of my friends in my class has one.
3162240	3163240	Okay.
3163240	3164240	Which she reads books under the table during class.
3164240	3166240	My mom has a Kindle and swears by it.
3166240	3169720	I have the Kindle app on my iPhone, and I absolutely love it.
3169720	3177760	And keep in mind, I'm trying to go into publication for my field when I'm out of school.
3177760	3185080	And thankfully, there's jobs out there for online publication as well as print publications.
3185080	3186480	Besides just blogging.
3186480	3190920	If you know how to do them both, you're in a good place.
3190920	3191920	Okay.
3191920	3192920	Mm-hmm.
3192920	3193920	Yeah, definitely.
3193920	3194920	And I've thankfully been printed before.
3194920	3195920	Yay.
3195920	3196920	Ooh.
3196920	3197920	Right here.
3197920	3198920	La-di-da.
3198920	3199920	All right.
3199920	3207440	I hate to do this, but I have actually breaking news, a special report we have to go to.
3207440	3214320	Live, late breaking news, you guys.
3214320	3215820	Very important.
3215820	3218920	There's just been a post on Facebook.
3218920	3221920	Joshua Hunter was born at 5.14 PM.
3221920	3222920	Yay.
3222920	3224920	So congratulations to Loki.
3224920	3226920	And there was much rejoicing.
3226920	3227920	Yay.
3227920	3228920	Congratulations.
3228920	3233520	And I actually think I just saw something in the orange lounge from Kitsune.
3233520	3236400	Yeah, that's how I knew to look.
3236400	3237400	So yeah.
3237400	3239400	Because they're able to refresh a little faster.
3239400	3240400	Okay.
3240400	3241400	I'm just making sure you're watching.
3241400	3242400	Oh, it's so cute.
3242400	3243400	I know, right?
3243400	3244400	So there you go.
3244400	3245400	Look at that little one.
3245400	3246400	Wow.
3246400	3248840	She couldn't have waited one more hour to have the baby during OLR.
3248840	3250840	Now it's a Bobby Black Wolf baby.
3250840	3251840	I'm sorry.
3251840	3252840	Babies wait for no one.
3252840	3253840	I'm kidding.
3253840	3260200	I'm sure Nellie's like, get this child out of me.
3260200	3261200	There it is.
3261200	3263280	That's my impression of Nellie in childbirth.
3263280	3265840	The baby kind of looks like Nellie.
3265840	3266840	Really?
3266840	3267840	Yeah.
3267840	3268840	He does.
3268840	3272480	I think he's got, though, you see that turn of his mouth?
3272480	3273480	Yeah.
3273480	3274480	That's totally Loki.
3274480	3275480	You can definitely see.
3275480	3278680	But he's got, I think he's got Nellie's nose.
3278680	3279680	So there you go.
3279680	3280680	All right.
3280680	3284320	Sorry to interrupt the show, but that was definitely worth interrupting a show for.
3284320	3289240	I wonder if they're going to have a bris for him, and then I feel really sorry.
3289240	3290800	Final Fantasy VII victory dance.
3290800	3291800	Wow, that brings back memories.
3291800	3292800	I know.
3292800	3294800	I should have found that music.
3294800	3295800	All right.
3295800	3299920	Well, any more baby news we get during the show, we'll bring to you, okay?
3299920	3300920	Yay.
3300920	3301920	All right.
3301920	3302920	He's so pretty.
3302920	3303920	And he's got red hair.
3303920	3304920	Yeah.
3304920	3305920	We're just glad that Starcraft didn't lay an egg.
3305920	3306920	Oh.
3306920	3307920	Ouch.
3307920	3308920	Where's my?
3308920	3309920	Yeah.
3309920	3310920	Too soon.
3310920	3311920	All right.
3311920	3312920	Moving on.
3312920	3313920	Where's my rimshot?
3313920	3314920	Wow.
3314920	3319320	Drew Nami's like, how long before he's eating super bacon?
3319320	3320320	Too soon, you guys.
3320320	3321320	Good God.
3321320	3322320	Be happy for 24 hours.
3322320	3323320	All right.
3323320	3326720	I know Act F has a point there.
3326720	3328800	It's the first, the first OLR baby.
3328800	3333440	Well, I can, I can, I gave a congratulations to his sperm and Nellie's hard work.
3333440	3336920	Loki and Nellie were only dating when the show started.
3336920	3337920	All right.
3337920	3338920	Seriously.
3338920	3339920	Who did all the work?
3339920	3340920	That's not, I'm not saying you're wrong.
3340920	3341920	I'm not saying you're wrong.
3341920	3345840	You know, I was, there's actually, there's a comedian I like called Henry Cho, who's
3345840	3349000	a Korean guy from Tennessee, so he sounds totally Tennessee.
3349000	3353280	I just want to remind the new listeners, last week we talked about games, the week before
3353280	3354280	we had a lot of game content.
3354280	3355280	Now there's a baby.
3355280	3357280	Normally we talk about games, we swear.
3357280	3361040	But, but I like it how he came home and the house was a mess, he asked his wife, he's
3361040	3362520	like, man, the house is a mess.
3362520	3363520	What'd you do?
3363520	3366440	Well, let's see, today I made a lung.
3366440	3368560	When you make body parts, let me know.
3368560	3369560	So.
3369560	3371440	All right.
3371440	3372680	Can I talk Starcraft 2?
3372680	3373680	Yeah.
3373680	3374680	Are you sure?
3374680	3375680	Go ahead.
3375680	3376680	All right.
3376680	3380440	Starcraft 2.
3380440	3385440	One thing that is supposedly, I guess, coming to Starcraft 2 in the future, I guess it was
3385440	3389660	supposed to be there when it launched, but it didn't make it, is chat rooms.
3389660	3390660	That's right.
3390660	3392080	You were supposed to have chat rooms in Starcraft 2.
3392080	3396160	It's not there yet, but it's going to be added in a later patch, and that is per a forum
3396160	3400160	post from one of the community managers over at Blizzard.
3400160	3404000	The chat room is going to be, quote, based around groups where you will be able to join
3404000	3407000	public channels that are based around your interests.
3407000	3408320	Sounds like it's going to be like AOL.
3408320	3409320	Yay.
3409320	3410320	No.
3410320	3411320	I'm kidding.
3411320	3412480	Is that a good thing?
3412480	3413800	I don't think so.
3413800	3417920	There will be private chat rooms as well if you are so inclined, or you could always use
3417920	3422440	real ID if you don't mind your last name being plastered all over the internet.
3422440	3423440	Yay.
3423440	3424440	There you go.
3424440	3425440	Which is why I use an alias.
3425440	3426440	There you go.
3426440	3430400	I tried, but Blizzard just took it right off my credit card and was like, oh hey, this
3430400	3431400	must be your name.
3431400	3432400	Aw.
3432400	3433400	All right.
3433400	3434400	Man, I know.
3434400	3436800	Anyhow, that's in the future for Starcraft 2.
3436800	3438800	DarkSakura, what do you got for us?
3438800	3439800	Baby.
3439800	3441800	I knew this was going to happen.
3441800	3442800	He's obsessed.
3442800	3443800	Thank you, everybody.
3443800	3444800	We'll see you next week.
3444800	3446800	No, no, no, no, no, no.
3446800	3447800	No, no.
3447800	3449800	The little bombs started ticking really hardcore.
3449800	3450800	Anyway.
3450800	3451800	Aw.
3451800	3453800	Did you feel a Twitter in your, or Twitter.
3453800	3455800	Did you feel a Twitter in your uterus?
3455800	3461240	Well, I was actually thinking of Kathy Griffin, so was it a Twitter in the twat?
3461240	3463040	Oh, too soon.
3463040	3464040	Ouch.
3464040	3465040	Where is that rim shot?
3465040	3467040	Rob's got the sad trombone.
3467040	3468040	No, no, no.
3468040	3469040	I got it right here.
3469040	3470040	I just did.
3470040	3471040	Uh.
3471040	3472040	Anyway.
3472040	3473040	Keep going?
3473040	3478480	Anyway, remember we were talking a while back about the R4 being banned, being that that's
3478480	3486040	the little memory card reader thing for the Nintendo DS so that you could play ROMs, or
3486040	3489480	copies of games, or bootleg games.
3489480	3490480	Um.
3490480	3491480	Bootleg?
3491480	3497420	So, there has, well, I've got a Ninja Pass, so I don't want to talk, but anyway, I really
3497420	3498720	got it for all my imports.
3498720	3499720	It's not mine, officer.
3499720	3500720	I swear.
3500720	3508240	But anyway, anyway, they actually, there's been released, they were banned in the UK,
3508240	3511800	and now there's a bit more information that's put out about it.
3511800	3517800	They basically said that it was actually related to a number of different devices that were
3517800	3525800	sold by Playables, which is the company that they banned was Playables Limited.
3525800	3530120	There are, the devices are defined, and this is a quote, enabled Nintendo DS users to play
3530120	3534800	unlawful copies of Nintendo DS games with which they have downloaded using the internet.
3534800	3535800	Ooh, naughty, naughty.
3535800	3538800	That's what Nintendo means about game copiers.
3538800	3544720	But the things that really make it illegal, and this is actually on the list are the R4
3544720	3552520	DS, M3 DS, DS1 Supercard, DSTT, DS Linker, Ace Card, Cyclo DS, Evolution, N5, and EZ
3552520	3553520	devices.
3553520	3554520	You didn't mention the Ninja Pass.
3554520	3555520	So all the fun stuff.
3555520	3556520	They didn't mention the Ninja Pass, so I'm cool.
3556520	3558520	Yeah, they always make the good stuff illegal.
3558520	3563200	But all of these are ones that use the micro SD flash card.
3563200	3569280	And the argument though, well basically, Nintendo's claim was that it was in violation of the
3569280	3574000	Copyright Designs and Patents Act of 1998 in the UK.
3574000	3585760	And the argument that Playables put up was basically that it was to play homebrew games.
3585760	3595240	Basically the whole big thing is that the device circumvents Nintendo's machine.
3595240	3601440	Any of the programming built into it that's there on purpose.
3601440	3606400	And so basically, all of these things, the different encryptions, different things that
3606400	3613080	Nintendo built into the hardware to protect from being able to use bootlegs and whatnot.
3613080	3615040	The device is supposed to counteract them.
3615040	3621160	So that's a big thing that Nintendo's got a bug up their butt about.
3621160	3628240	And according to Nintendo, they've seized more than 165,000 game copiers that were intended
3628240	3630640	for Playables.
3630640	3637440	And so basically, that was the whole deal about it.
3637440	3643820	Even though there's a bunch of other cool things you can do with them, the whole big
3643820	3650240	thing has to do with circumventing their hardware.
3650240	3653880	I get that and all, but doesn't this seem a little throwing out the baby with the bath
3653880	3655480	water to you?
3655480	3657160	No pun intended.
3657160	3661440	Because this is where...
3661440	3665880	They're saying that since you can use this device to pirate games, it shouldn't be out
3665880	3666880	there on the market.
3666880	3671880	But I can use my computer to pirate games, does that mean my computer should be banned?
3671880	3674540	I mean, it's more about what you use it for.
3674540	3678360	And the good thing about the R4 is that it does open it up to homebrew.
3678360	3680980	Now of course, I can see both sides of it.
3680980	3684440	There's a lot of people that can sit there and go, okay, you know damn well there's plenty
3684440	3687360	of people that buy those R4s that aren't using it for homebrew.
3687360	3689400	They are using it for the malicious purpose.
3689400	3690400	So it's tough.
3690400	3691400	It's like, where do you draw the line?
3691400	3695460	I don't know.
3695460	3705120	That's a tough call, because with the gaming community, that kind of stuff is really hard
3705120	3706120	to call.
3706120	3714360	Because you've got the regular honest gamers who actually buy their stuff, and they don't
3714360	3720360	get access to this because just a bunch of people decided, oh, we're going to steal games.
3720360	3725960	So it's not fair to both the legitimate players, as well as the guys who are doing the stuff.
3725960	3729840	So it's, you know, either way, it's a bad deal.
3729840	3735080	You see, if Nintendo would open up the DS to homebrew, not that I see them ever doing
3735080	3738720	that, but if they were to do something like that, you know, this cart wouldn't really
3738720	3743680	have a lot of leg to stand on, because its only purpose would be for something shady.
3743680	3748040	But I get it, Nintendo doesn't want to open that up, because then, you know, there's going
3748040	3750080	to be all sorts of scary homebrew.
3750080	3754960	Well there would be homebrew to play, you know, Sony PS1 games on your DS, or something
3754960	3756040	like that, you know what I mean?
3756040	3757840	Which would just be horrible!
3757840	3760360	I know, right?
3760360	3764000	How many people originally bought a PSP to play the NES emulator that was out at the
3764000	3765000	time?
3765000	3768240	Well, I didn't buy one, but yeah.
3768240	3772160	And that's another thing, like, games that strictly come out for the PSP.
3772160	3778560	Like Dissidia, or Birth by Sleep.
3778560	3784360	You know, both of those games that just came out for the PSP, you know, if it wasn't for
3784360	3787940	emulators, most of us wouldn't be able to play those games.
3787940	3793500	Because we're not going to plunker down $120 just to buy a console for a game for two games
3793500	3795560	that we're going to play.
3795560	3797040	It's just ridiculous.
3797040	3800720	So it's part of the reason why I didn't play Kingdom Hearts Chain of Memories, is because
3800720	3801720	I didn't own a DS.
3801720	3805400	Yeah, but at the same time, emulators, especially to play current games, are like super duper
3805400	3807720	illegal and just as bad as what they're banning.
3807720	3811960	I mean, at least know what, you know, that it is what it is.
3811960	3817560	Well, at least with the R4 and those devices, they are contingent on you having the system.
3817560	3818560	Mm-hmm.
3818560	3819560	True.
3819560	3820560	Yeah.
3820560	3821560	Yeah.
3821560	3822560	Was there more you wanted to say there, Jamie?
3822560	3823560	I thought I heard you turning it up.
3823560	3828000	No, it was just quoting other cases in Europe that were, you know, had to do with reel-to-reel
3828000	3833000	tape copiers, but said that this was far worse because it did actually go right on the edge
3833000	3834160	of copyright infringement.
3834160	3838480	All right, well look, if you want something for free, here's something new that's going
3838480	3841640	to be for free that doesn't involve questionable legality things.
3841640	3843600	This is a totally legit thing.
3843600	3846680	EverQuest 2 is soon going to have a free model.
3846680	3847680	What?
3847680	3850880	Yeah, EverQuest 2 is getting EverQuest 2 extended.
3850880	3854880	Now here's the thing though, this is not like when Lords of the Ring, or was it, yeah, Lords
3854880	3857280	of the Rings opened up, no, D&D opened up to free-to-play.
3857280	3859680	Maybe Lords of the Ring did too, I can't remember.
3859680	3863320	Yeah, DDO opened up to win free, but there's, you know, you still have to, certain things
3863320	3865960	you still have to pay for in the game, but yeah.
3865960	3869440	And that's something, somewhat what's going to happen here too, but EverQuest 2 is getting
3869440	3876920	a free-to-play version, so there's going to be, EverQuest 2 will still exist as it does
3876920	3882920	today, but they're going to launch, kind of next door, EverQuest 2 extended, so it's kind
3882920	3884920	of like a parallel universe, if you will.
3884920	3888920	It's going to use a web-based application, there will be free and there will be optional
3888920	3893640	paid memberships, you can buy equipment in the game, but you still get access to all
3893640	3898100	the zones that you have right now, there's this whole FAQ up on the website, they do
3898100	3902120	plan to launch this in mid-August, but it's interesting because they show all these different
3902120	3903480	types of plans.
3903480	3908120	You can get a free plan for bronze, what they call the bronze level is free, there's a silver
3908120	3914280	plan that's a $10 one-time purchase that gets you more character slots, more, let's see,
3914280	3919520	I'm trying to see what else, you get more spells opened up, you get more bag slots and
3919520	3925400	so forth, more, you do get limits on your coins, but that goes up at the silver level,
3925400	3931080	or you can pay $15 a month for the gold level, which gets you, I imagine, pretty much everything
3931080	3936320	you get with EverQuest 2, or if you want, you can plunk down $200 for a full year.
3936320	3943760	You've got to be really dedicated for that, but $200 across a year is $18 a month, but
3943760	3947240	that's like the Uber access where you have unlimited everything.
3947240	3948240	Interesting tactic.
3948240	3950800	I don't know if there'll be a lot of platinum and gold players on there, because I think
3950800	3954720	they would be all in regular EverQuest, but I bet you'd get a lot of bronze and maybe
3954720	3955720	even some silvers.
3955720	3959360	And that isn't going to cross over with the regular EverQuest 2, that's going to be its
3959360	3960880	own separate thing.
3960880	3965760	That's what they're saying now, but my curiosity is, well then what if one population starts
3965760	3969320	to really off-balance the other, is there a possibility they might merge them later
3969320	3970320	on?
3970320	3975400	I was reading on this thing about if you've already got an existing subscription for EverQuest,
3975400	3977280	then you basically get a gold account.
3977280	3981760	Okay, that's what I figured, is that if you're already paying them $15 a month, that's probably
3981760	3984320	what the regular ones are paying them.
3984320	3987360	Interesting though, that not only have they launched, and maybe this is the unreported
3987360	3992920	part of the story, is that not only have they launched a free, but they've also launched
3992920	3996200	a pay us more version with that platinum tier.
3996200	3999880	Is it more expensive than the regular games monthly subscription?
3999880	4003600	I think the regular games monthly is the same as that gold, $15 a month, at least that's
4003600	4008160	like the average MMO subscription, but $200 a year, I mean that's not as terrible as it
4008160	4014080	sounds because you have to divide 200 by 12, so it's about what, maybe 18 a month?
4014080	4017240	So it's not terrible.
4017240	4023580	You know, how you were saying with the going to free to play, I, when I actually had the
4023580	4028840	power on my computer to do it, I used to play this game Cartoon Network's Fusion Fall.
4028840	4031240	Don't knock it till you've tried it.
4031240	4038040	We're big fans of Robot Unicorn Attack here, so yeah, definitely play those games.
4038040	4043360	The Cartoon Network Universe MMO, originally when it first came out, you would have the
4043360	4051240	future levels, which was like about five sections of the world, and you know, a couple of quests
4051240	4056280	and things like that, and then in order to go to the past, was a whole new world.
4056280	4063040	It was a totally expanded world, and that was like 15 a month, and now, I think it was
4063040	4069880	back in April, they went completely free to play, and they're, they literally skyrocketed
4069880	4073600	their membership because they finally went free to play, because a lot of us who really
4073600	4083480	enjoyed the game were pissed that it, that most of the game cost you money, because you
4083480	4085880	know, me being a poor gamer, you know?
4085880	4089400	I am totally against paying any sort of money for a game.
4089400	4091120	Okay, within ten dollars.
4091120	4095320	Well, there's a lot of people listening that are probably in the same boat you are, but
4095320	4101200	there's a shout out coming here from GioVedea in our chatroom at chat.orangelandraday.com.
4101200	4106680	Fusion Fall is amazing, VidPower in our chatroom says those old Cartoon Network Toonami Flash
4106680	4110760	games were great, Dark Tetsuya says an Adult Swim needs an MMO.
4110760	4116400	Yeah, well, Fusion Fall is close enough to an Adult Swim MMO, because the graphics of
4116400	4122320	the game really remind me of this wonderful artist called Bleedman, who's on DeviantArt,
4122320	4125860	and look him up, he's awesome.
4125860	4130880	It's like making the cartoony, you know, like Dexter, not so cartoony, like he actually
4130880	4136600	has a body, and hands, and arms, what a concept.
4136600	4137600	Very cool.
4137600	4138600	Yay.
4138600	4140040	DarkSakura, what do you got next for us?
4140040	4141880	Well, we have some other stuff.
4141880	4150080	For fans of Force Unleashed, well, Force Unleashed 2 has been in development, except the executive
4150080	4151080	producer quit.
4151080	4153080	Oh no.
4153080	4158600	Hayden Blackman resigned from LucasArts after being with them for thirteen years, and he
4158600	4161460	just said it was time to go.
4161460	4165360	He was like, I am not putting Jar Jar Binks in my game, F you.
4165360	4170240	Well, as a quote, while the decision to leave LucasArts did not happen overnight or come
4170240	4175680	easily, I really feel that now is the best time for me to move on and explore new creative
4175680	4179880	challenges, and look forward to the next phase of my career, meaning, god, I hate this place,
4179880	4180880	I want to quit.
4180880	4184600	I know, like, totally reading through the lines, there's huge drama that went down that
4184600	4186000	you're never going to know about.
4186000	4187000	Yeah.
4187000	4192160	And LucasArts is saying that his departure is not going to affect the game's development
4192160	4193160	at all.
4193160	4194160	Yeah.
4194160	4195920	No, it won't affect the quality at all.
4195920	4196920	No.
4196920	4197920	Well, you never know.
4197920	4200640	I mean, I know we're sitting here kind of poking fun, but it could get better.
4200640	4201640	Who knows?
4201640	4204160	And of course, you know, LucasArts left the dry.
4204160	4208840	We are extremely grateful for his many contributions, fully support him in his new endeavors, and
4208840	4210800	wish him all the best in the future.
4210800	4214040	Because we're a company in California, and you're not allowed to say really anything
4214040	4219200	bad about your previous employees, including the reasons why they left.
4219200	4222280	By the way, I had a friend that worked at LucasArts, and she totally got me in the Skywalker
4222280	4223280	Ranch.
4223280	4224280	Whoa.
4224280	4225280	You've been doing this on the show before.
4225280	4226280	I'm always trying.
4226280	4228600	Didn't you have George Lucas walk right by, and you said something about you want to fling
4228600	4229600	your sandwich at him?
4229600	4232120	I was in meatloaf-looking distance of George Lucas.
4232120	4234000	I've heard this story on the show before.
4234000	4235000	I wanted my money back.
4235000	4236000	Thank God for your self-restraint.
4236000	4238000	What a concept.
4238000	4243680	Anyhow, moving on to non-Star Wars-related news, but certainly another series has a lot
4243680	4244680	of fans.
4244680	4245680	Halo.
4245680	4248880	Of course, Halo Reach is on its way out a little later this year.
4248880	4252240	What's very interesting, though, is that it was announced this week that Bungie, and this
4252240	4257880	was in an interview they had with Xbox 360 achievements, the website, talking about the
4257880	4263520	community director at Bungie, Brian Gerard, is saying that in Halo Reach, they're going
4263520	4267280	to be doing something a little differently for you folks who like to quit your games
4267280	4268280	early.
4268280	4271960	Quote, I think one of the new things people will be excited about, too, is how we're going
4271960	4276920	to be able to penalize people who are habitually quitting out of games, which isn't exactly
4276920	4281560	cheating, but it creates a really negative experience for everybody else in the game.
4281560	4283280	So they're going to penalize rage quitting?
4283280	4284280	Yes.
4284280	4285280	Nice.
4285280	4290280	We actually have new tools now to detect that, and eventually, people who do this habitually
4290280	4292780	will actually be penalized.
4292780	4297680	We want to be able to remove them from the population so they can't make everyone else
4297680	4299320	keep having a bad time.
4299320	4304080	Now, of course, they don't elaborate on what exactly they're doing, but doesn't that sound
4304080	4309160	to me like if you rage quit too much, you're going to get banished to Rage Quit Island,
4309160	4311820	where you will play with nothing but other rage quitters?
4311820	4314040	And not be allowed to rage quit.
4314040	4316120	That sounds kind of amazing, actually.
4316120	4317680	They should make them do Battle Royale.
4317680	4319120	For real.
4319120	4322040	But at the same time, okay, they say they're going to be able to tell the difference between
4322040	4323280	a rage quit and a disconnect.
4323280	4324280	Well, let me tell you this.
4324280	4328740	In Final Fantasy XI, my version of rage quit was to go turn off the cable modem.
4328740	4334280	So how would they know that that was, how did they know that that's me rage quitting
4334280	4335280	and not a disconnect?
4335280	4339040	Like, you know, I get, like, backing out of a match and all that, or quitting or whatever,
4339040	4344120	but how do they know the difference between that and a legitimate drop of the connection?
4344120	4346720	Well, you know those wonderful ninja mods.
4346720	4348920	You never know where they are.
4348920	4350680	Maybe it could be the timing of it, too.
4350680	4355600	Like if you are habitually always quitting when a certain circumstance is met, then that's
4355600	4358520	when you get banished to Rage Quit Island or something.
4358520	4363620	Like if, hmm, you're down and you always seem to lose your connection one minute before
4363620	4368000	the match is over, you're probably going to get targeted for exile, is my thought.
4368000	4371960	Well, how do you know when somebody quits because they're, just because they're pissed
4371960	4374880	and if somebody quits because they have a real emergency happening?
4374880	4378160	I mean, obviously, that would be kind of rare, you'd hope, but, you know.
4378160	4381800	Well, now they do use the word habitual, so you would probably have to do it more than
4381800	4382800	once, for sure.
4382800	4383800	Okay.
4383800	4384800	Let's see.
4384800	4388000	Tigerclaw says, maybe someone with high pings lagging out and disconnecting.
4388000	4392000	Ah, maybe kind of seeing, like, oh, the pings suddenly get slower and slower.
4392000	4395400	That's a legitimate disconnect where somebody who just had a really good connection and
4395400	4397720	suddenly, oop, it's gone, maybe a little less.
4397720	4403760	I'd be very curious to see how this all plays out, how they're going to treat that.
4403760	4406800	But I love the idea of making all the rage quitters play together on their own little
4406800	4410200	island where they can all rage quit and, you know, go after themselves.
4410200	4412680	It's like trapping a bunch of trolls on a single island.
4412680	4413680	Exactly.
4413680	4414680	They kill each other.
4414680	4415680	Wow.
4415680	4416680	That's amazing.
4416680	4419960	I love the idea of Xbox Live being like the continent of awesome people and then trolls
4419960	4421200	banished to their own island.
4421200	4422200	Sounds great to me.
4422200	4423200	I wish you could do that on every single island.
4423200	4425880	If they're trolls, they need to be banished to their own bridge.
4425880	4426880	To go live under?
4426880	4430200	As long as the bridge doesn't connect to anything, sure, I'm all for that.
4430200	4431200	All right.
4431200	4435480	We're going to move on to Dark Sakura with some gaming news, then we're going to get
4435480	4437600	into release dates in just a little bit here.
4437600	4440480	Of course, the moment Rob says that, I dropped chips on the floor.
4440480	4441480	I'm sorry, Dark Sakura.
4441480	4443920	Well, you didn't make me drop the chips.
4443920	4444920	That's right.
4444920	4445920	You're just clumsy.
4445920	4446920	My hand is broken.
4446920	4447920	Knock it off.
4447920	4448920	She has an excuse.
4448920	4449920	Use your good hand.
4449920	4450920	God gave you two.
4450920	4453920	I need to go take some more Vicodin.
4453920	4454920	Aw.
4454920	4458040	Okay, Valve made a whoops.
4458040	4466440	They banned 12,000 legitimate Modern Warfare 2 players.
4466440	4477240	Basically the software that's in Steamworks to get the cheaters went on an extermination
4477240	4483400	rampage and banned 12,000 players over the last two weeks.
4483400	4486720	Basically what happened is that, and this is a quote from the email that was sent out
4486720	4492120	by Gabe Newell, who's the Valve president, the problem was that Steam would fail a signature
4492120	4498400	check between the disk version of a DLL and a latent memory version.
4498400	4502520	So basically they said, you know, our bad, sorry.
4502520	4503520	Whoops.
4503520	4504520	I like that he's angst.
4504520	4506800	I apologize for any frustration or angst at me that's caused you.
4506800	4508240	Haven't I ever seen angst in a professional shooter?
4508240	4510200	Can you all turn your caps lock off now?
4510200	4511440	I know, right?
4511440	4520800	So he's also promised a giftable copy of Left 4 Dead 2 to all of those affected, as well
4520800	4523480	as a copy for themselves.
4523480	4527640	So if I get accidentally banned from a Steam game, I'm going to get two free copies of
4527640	4529000	a game.
4529000	4530000	One is giftable.
4530000	4531000	Right.
4531000	4532880	That's basically two free copies, right?
4532880	4534680	One for you and one for someone you really like.
4534680	4535680	Yeah.
4535680	4538600	So hey, any of you that's been affected by this, gimme.
4538600	4539600	Right?
4539600	4545000	That's kind of where I'm at too, I'm like, you know, I have Left 4 Dead 1, but not 2.
4545000	4551560	Well, I think why they're giving Left 4 Dead 2 out is because, you know, when you get banned
4551560	4556360	from a game like Modern Warfare 2, you know, the only compensation you can get is to go
4556360	4559320	around kiddling a bunch of zombies is compensation, you know?
4559320	4561000	It's a fair trade.
4561000	4563760	Well also, playing a big hairy biker.
4563760	4564760	Exactly.
4564760	4569560	Besides the also obvious part that it's also their game, you know, it is Val's game.
4569560	4571620	It's kind of one that they can give away.
4571620	4576800	It actually is kind of impressive that they instead didn't go, oh, well, whoops, we'll
4576800	4582100	give you a copy of what's what's what's cheaper Left 4 Dead 1, you know, or something magical
4582100	4583100	unicorn fart.
4583100	4584100	Yeah, exactly.
4584100	4585100	Magical.
4585100	4586100	Well, I don't think that was a valve game.
4586100	4589480	So you can have a free copy of Alien Swarm.
4589480	4592280	Yeah, Alien Swarm.
4592280	4594680	Oh, wait, everybody's getting that free.
4594680	4599040	So have we talked already about the wonderfulness that is Portal 2?
4599040	4603880	Uh, on this show we have, but did you watch all the, um, while I'm firing up release dates?
4603880	4604880	Tech demonstrations?
4604880	4605880	Wow!
4605880	4607120	I know, right?
4607120	4609120	I love the slippery thing.
4609120	4610120	The what?
4610120	4611120	The slippery goo?
4611120	4612120	Yes, the goo.
4612120	4613120	I love the goo.
4613120	4614120	And the bouncy goo?
4614120	4615120	I love the bouncy goo.
4615120	4616120	That was so great.
4616120	4620080	I was I was very much pleased with with the entire concept of Portal.
4620080	4625400	Um, you know, the fact that they changed the the, oh, and I died.
4625400	4626400	Oh, well.
4626400	4627400	Are you still playing RuneScape?
4627400	4628400	Yes, I'm still playing RuneScape.
4628400	4629400	I'm still playing RuneScape.
4629400	4630400	The zombie just killed me.
4630400	4632400	You're worse than Loki in Magic Robot Unicorn.
4632400	4633720	He plays Magic Robot Unicorn.
4633720	4636560	He denies that he does it too, but he does.
4636560	4641320	But um, but yeah, I the only, you know, grief I kind of have was the fact that they're using
4641320	4644720	the, they're theoretically using the same protagonist, but she looks nothing like the
4644720	4645720	original game.
4645720	4647280	Did they put a picture of her?
4647280	4650700	Um, they did, but they didn't.
4650700	4652800	It's like, um, they had in the picture of her.
4652800	4657120	Well, I saw the one that was in Game Informer, um, the different, uh,
4657120	4660320	Well, you know, she's also supposed to be, the actual person is supposed to be showing
4660320	4662920	up in, um, Half Life 3.
4662920	4666200	We also might've set off an LOL, Accidental False Alarm in chat.
4666200	4668160	Uh, Thamster says, wait, is that out now?
4668160	4669160	No, no, no, no, it's not.
4669160	4671160	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
4671160	4672160	That's a 2011.
4672160	4674000	No, no, no, no, nope.
4674000	4677000	But there are some sexy demos on YouTube if you want to go check it out.
4677000	4680480	Uh, let's go to release dates, travel around the world and talk about games that are going
4680480	4681480	to be coming out.
4681480	4682480	Yeah.
4682480	4685020	Portal 2 will not be on the list this week, but maybe some other stuff.
4685020	4686680	So I'm going to start with the US tonight.
4686680	4689080	We're going to shake things up a little bit because obviously Loki's not here.
4689080	4692800	So I'm going to cover US tonight and, uh, pronounce things correctly for once.
4692800	4693800	I hope.
4693800	4696080	Uh, Monster Rancher DS is out this week.
4696080	4698900	It's going to cost you 30 bucks if you want that on the DS.
4698900	4699900	Sing it.
4699900	4700900	Family Hits.
4700900	4701900	That's right.
4701900	4704360	Cause you know, you want to sing songs from Beauty and the Beast and the Little Mermaid
4704360	4709000	all from Disney coming out on the DS and I'm sorry, the PlayStation three and the Wii
4709000	4710440	this week.
4710440	4712240	You know what's interesting though?
4712240	4713720	The PS3 one is cheaper.
4713720	4715600	Oh, because the Wii one comes with the mic.
4715600	4716760	I get it.
4716760	4720560	Uh, Gary, I know this, this is going to be the one to get you back into console games.
4720560	4721560	You ready?
4721560	4722560	Dora the Explorer.
4722560	4724560	Dora's big first adventure on the DS.
4724560	4725560	Oh, whatever.
4725560	4726560	30 bucks.
4726560	4727560	Oh no.
4727560	4728560	I know.
4728560	4731120	If I wanted to get another console, I'd get a PS3.
4731120	4732120	No.
4732120	4735640	Junior classic books and fairy tales, $20 on the Nintendo DS.
4735640	4739880	This is basically you're paying for 130 bucks that are pretty much in the public domain
4739880	4743620	or were really cheap to license, but if you want that, hey, have fun with it.
4743620	4748280	So, uh, uh, quite a barrage of some more wireless controllers and accessories also out this
4748280	4749280	week.
4749280	4752560	And, uh, I think we might've hit on most of the games.
4752560	4753560	Yeah.
4753560	4756480	I think it's kind of a slow week in game release world.
4756480	4758760	I'm trying to see if there's anything else this week.
4758760	4760280	Well, there's nothing in the budget.
4760280	4762480	They got anything good in the budget Ben?
4762480	4766720	Uh, well, this new game on the Xbox 360 is only $30.
4766720	4767720	It's a role playing game.
4767720	4772440	And for an Xbox 360 game, that's something it's a auger rest war and it's comes out on
4772440	4779560	the fifth record of auger rest record of auger rest war familiar, like a certain, uh, war.
4779560	4780560	Yeah.
4780560	4781560	Yeah.
4781560	4782560	Could be inspired.
4782560	4786960	I was going to tell you record of us were started off from a Japanese tabletop game.
4786960	4787960	Yeah.
4787960	4788960	Yeah.
4788960	4789960	I knew that.
4789960	4793680	And if I had a bootleg of the legend of Kristinia, which was supposed to be like the original
4793680	4799240	sequel and they showed a bunch of guys at the convention playing it, why am I not surprised?
4799240	4800440	That's all I have for the U S this week.
4800440	4804040	Well, like I said, the UK is looking pretty bare, nothing until next week.
4804040	4805600	So I'm going to do Japan.
4805600	4806600	Yay.
4806600	4810360	Sorry to take your pronunciation away from you, Rob.
4810360	4811360	It's really fine.
4811360	4813840	Put all that anime pronunciation skill to the test.
4813840	4818440	Well, um, we've got a few things that don't really particularly have a date on it, but
4818440	4819440	they're for PC and Mac.

4884640	4885640	Oh, good.
4885640	4886640	Okay.
4886640	4887960	Well, you know, I just read too fast.
4887960	4893880	And then we have Mamegoma Kawaii Gaibai, um, oh no, I'm thinking Oppai, Oppai means boobs.
4893880	4897080	Um, Tetris party premium also on, um, August 5th.
4897080	4898960	Wait, there's a game about boobs coming out?
4898960	4902120	No, it's Ipai and I thought I was thinking Oppai, which is.
4902120	4903120	Surprises you.
4903120	4904120	Yeah.
4904120	4911080	PlayStation two, we have J league winning 11, 2010 club championship and persona three,
4911080	4916400	uh, FES, which is a PlayStation, the best to re-release persona four, also PlayStation
4916400	4918000	two, the best.

4923280	4926360	11 is also on the list, so the persona games were really good.
4926360	4927360	I really liked them.
4927360	4928360	Believe it or not.
4928360	4931240	We have sports fans that listen to the show who want their roster update for the year.
4931240	4935800	Just like DDR fans with their song, like who in Japan likes American football anyway, on
4935800	4940280	the way we have Tetris party premium and twinkle queen.
4940280	4943880	Also, um, arcade shooter, twinkle queen, let me look this up.
4943880	4946160	I think I met a drag queen like that once.
4946160	4947160	Ooh.
4947160	4948160	It looks pretty.
4948160	4950120	Isn't that a game right up your alley?
4950120	4952120	No, I'm looking at screen captures of it.
4952120	4953120	Oh, it's a fighting game.
4953120	4954680	Oh, it's an all girl fighting game.
4954680	4955680	Oh, sweet.
4955680	4956680	Oh, wow.
4956680	4957680	You have my attention.
4957680	4960720	Sort of like the OSCO 120% back in the day.
4960720	4961760	Been there, done that.
4961760	4964800	How many all chick fighting games have we seen at this point?
4964800	4968560	Anyway, they are not going to sleep with you when you beat the game, just so you know.
4968560	4973360	A few, um, um, you know, undated things that I just think is funny is gun blade, New York
4973360	4976600	and LA machine guns arcade pack, which I would totally get.
4976600	4977600	Love you.
4977600	4983800	Sega, um, colds, gym, dance, workout, and I know, right.
4983800	4987520	And Lucha Libre, triple a heroes, Dell ring.
4987520	4994120	And um, that was the one they were plugging at, uh, E3 and Disney guilty party.
4994120	4997640	I know what game that is, but that's just a funny way of phrasing it.
4997640	4999360	That Disney guilty party.
4999360	5003920	Who's guilty of stealing the cookies that like clue and it kind of is like a who done
5003920	5004920	a game.
5004920	5005920	There were so many characters.
5005920	5008200	The only thing, uh, it's like an original Disney game.
5008200	5011560	It's not like Ariel and beauty of the beast and stuff.
5011560	5015360	The only Disney game that I'm actually looking forward to that they were, um, that they were
5015360	5019160	plugging in E3 really, really bad was Epic Mickey.
5019160	5020160	That looks amazing.
5020160	5025720	Epic Mickey does look Epic, but I got to give a shout out to Tron because I don't stand
5025720	5031160	for movies very often, but I will be there day one Tron 3D and I'm going to have the
5031160	5033320	biggest fanboy boner in the galaxy.
5033320	5034320	Oh yeah.
5034320	5035320	Gamers unite!
5035320	5039640	We'll have to just have a party of it, then you know they're going to sell so many tie
5039640	5040640	in games with that.
5040640	5041640	It's going to be ridiculous.
5041640	5042640	If it's a good movie.
5042640	5045640	I had a light second game on my phone.
5045640	5046640	Yeah.
5046640	5051900	Anyway, back to the Japanese list, um, PlayStation 3, Assassin's Creed II special edition and
5051900	5055840	Tiger Woods PGA Tour 11, why?
5055840	5060760	And then finally for Xbox 360 we have Assassin's Creed II special edition platinum collection.
5060760	5065200	Magna Carta 2, which I know is pretty big, and it's a platinum collection, and that would
5065200	5066200	be all.
5066200	5067200	That's everything.
5067200	5069840	A lot of those were budget-binned games or re-releases, which I really like.
5069840	5071240	Yeah, Magna Carta 2 is a re-release.
5071240	5074740	Yeah, Japan seems to be doing a lot of price reductions this time of year.
5074740	5077880	Don't know what the occasion is, but hey, I'll take any excuse.
5077880	5079280	Yeah, so will I.
5079280	5083600	Yeah, somebody's got some serious rage against Mickey on the chat room.
5083600	5085360	That would actually be Drunami.
5085360	5089560	Some folks in our chat room are asking, uh, where is, where was it here, I'm going back
5089560	5093400	to our chat room, chat.orangelaungeradio.com, and I think the whole twinkle queen brought
5093400	5094400	this up.
5094400	5097480	Frisbee's asking, where the fuck is the RuPaul's Drag Race game?
5097480	5102320	I think we talked about that on a previous edition of OLR.
5102320	5106960	Frisbee is saying, or RuPaul's Mario Kart slash Diddy Kong Racing, I really do want
5106960	5109320	RuPaul to have a video game of some sort.
5109320	5113340	Like if Project Runway can have a freaking game, or what, The Bachelor had a game come
5113340	5117040	out last week or this week or something, I mean, come on.
5117040	5118640	This bitch needs a game.
5118640	5119640	Exactly.
5119640	5120640	Come on.
5120640	5121640	Exactly.
5121640	5125100	Who would, I mean, come on chat room, which would you rather play?
5125100	5129480	The Bachelor or RuPaul's Drag Race?
5129480	5135680	Even, look, even you guys who have no interest in drag whatsoever, completely secure your
5135680	5140120	masculinity and your love of women, I think you would play RuPaul's Drag Race versus The
5140120	5141120	Bachelor.
5141120	5142120	Absolutely.
5142120	5143120	And why do you say this?
5143120	5144120	Because it's awesome.
5144120	5146560	Because The Bachelor is gayer than RuPaul's Drag Race.
5146560	5147560	It really is.
5147560	5148560	I won't argue with that.
5148560	5149560	You know what?
5149560	5150560	Okay.
5150560	5151560	This is my thing.
5151560	5157960	Is it when I saw, when I see my husband spend hours customizing wrestling characters, like
5157960	5158960	they're dressed up dolls.
5158960	5159960	It's Barbie.
5159960	5160960	Yeah.
5160960	5161960	It's Barbie for men.
5161960	5162960	I was like, yeah, men really like to do this too.
5162960	5165560	Well, wrestling is just soap opera for men.
5165560	5166920	There's nothing wrong with that.
5166920	5167920	Men need their stories.
5167920	5168920	Very bad soap opera.
5168920	5171080	I loved it.
5171080	5176820	And speaking of the whole rage quitting thing for Halo, I just rage created RuneScape because
5176820	5177820	I was sick of dying.
5177820	5178820	I died twice.
5178820	5181840	You need to get banished to a rage quit island.
5181840	5185960	Oh, actually, don't get me started on the fact that, you know, I started the game day
5185960	5192220	one in RuneScape, you know, had to fend for myself, had to learn how to use all my skills
5192220	5196680	on my own, then about, you know, two years after I started playing, they introduced New
5196680	5197680	Byland.
5197680	5198680	Oi!
5198680	5199680	New Byland.
5199680	5200680	They basically show you-
5200680	5202280	There really is a place called New Byland.
5202280	5203280	Yeah.
5203280	5206560	They basically show you how to get to fifth level.
5206560	5210480	They walk you through it tutorial style on how to crab-
5210480	5212200	The little hand come out of the monitor.
5212200	5213200	Exactly.
5213200	5214200	Come with me.
5214200	5216720	It's like that stupid Milo thing they were showing at E3 last year.
5216720	5217720	Like come with me.
5217720	5218720	Yeah.
5218720	5220800	They were probably gonna listen to many of those people.
5220800	5223920	It reminded me of that annoying paperclip guy on Word.
5223920	5224920	Oh, God.
5224920	5226360	Let me turn the thing off.
5226360	5228580	I just caught a pepper in my wound.
5228580	5233600	Every work computer I ever log into for the first time, I'm always like, okay, first thing's
5233600	5234600	first.
5234600	5235600	Launch Word.
5235600	5236600	Kill that office assistant.
5236600	5237600	Right click, disable.
5237600	5238600	Kill the paperclip.
5238600	5239600	Euthanize the paperclip.
5239600	5241500	Or the wizard or whatever form it happens to take.
5241500	5243500	That thing is so bloody annoying.
5243500	5248640	Do you know how many people I've seen in my professional career that like to have Mr.
5248640	5252800	Paperclip up all day long, but they don't like, you know how in Word you can actually
5252800	5253800	change it.
5253800	5254800	So you can change it.
5254800	5255800	Clippy.
5255800	5256800	That's what it's name was.
5256800	5257800	You have Clippy, but you also have the little kitty.
5257800	5258800	Yeah.
5258800	5262440	And I can't tell you how many I've seen that just like to leave the cat up on their desk
5262440	5268320	all day, like a little virtual Tamagotchi kitty pet running around their desktop.
5268320	5274460	And I'm like, but hey, look, I'm all about whatever makes you happy, but at the same
5274460	5278400	time don't complain about your system being slow when you have Miss Kitty running around
5278400	5279400	chasing yarn.
5279400	5280400	Yep.
5280400	5281400	Yep.
5281400	5282400	Yes.
5282400	5283400	Clippy must die.
5283400	5284400	My word for the whole thing is why?
5284400	5285400	Because not a question.
5285400	5286400	Because they need their hands held.
5286400	5287400	Not a question.
5287400	5288400	Just why.
5288400	5289400	Hold on.
5289400	5291640	Dark Tetsuya is making the project journey game for OLR, right?
5291640	5295320	Can we have a level where like Dark Sakura shoots paperclips?
5295320	5297880	I think that would be appropriate.
5297880	5299240	She can euthanize Mr. Paperclip.
5299240	5300860	That would be great.
5300860	5301860	Just making that request.
5301860	5302860	That's not gory enough.
5302860	5303860	That guy needs to die horribly.
5303860	5307880	Well, then a paperclip can just attack her hand if she loses.
5307880	5312800	Rob, the giant paperclip, but when you shoot him, he leads kittens.
5312800	5318600	I was thinking just Mr. Paperclip could melt into slag slowly and painfully, but okay,
5318600	5319600	fine.
5319600	5320600	Okay.
5320600	5322320	Well, Rob, can I do a story?
5322320	5323320	Yes, you may.
5323320	5324320	Okay.
5324320	5325320	Guess what?
5325320	5326320	What?
5326320	5328680	Disney acquired Playdom.
5328680	5329680	What does that mean?
5329680	5332360	Well, Playdom does sorority life, Rob.
5332360	5334480	My favorite Facebook game.
5334480	5336640	I so quit that really fast.
5336640	5337640	What?
5337640	5343160	I played, I seriously played sorority life religiously for like a month and then I got,
5343160	5344160	don't judge me.
5344160	5346520	I see you judging him.
5346520	5348680	You totally were just judging me right there.
5348680	5349680	Did you see that look?
5349680	5350680	That was the look of judgment.
5350680	5351680	He was judging.
5351680	5352680	Chips.
5352680	5353680	That's right.
5353680	5354680	Oh.
5354680	5356760	I need to grab the chips because this is just entertaining now.
5356760	5360400	I was playing, look, but do you know why I was playing sorority life?
5360400	5365680	Because there was a dress up character mode and I was the fiercest diva on the block.
5365680	5366680	I was.
5366680	5367680	I got nothing.
5367680	5368680	I got nothing.
5368680	5372560	And uh, she would, she would beat bitches down with her purse cause that's just sorority
5372560	5373560	life.
5373560	5375920	But here's what started frustrating me about sorority life.
5375920	5380200	They implemented, and I cannot believe we are giving this any FaceTime on the show,
5380200	5383080	but I really want to reiterate this week.
5383080	5384080	I don't give a fuck.
5384080	5385080	All right.
5385080	5386080	All right.
5386080	5388000	So anyway, so sorority life.
5388000	5390160	Whatever floats your boat, man.
5390160	5391160	Whatever sinks your battleship.
5391160	5393040	Yes, that too.
5393040	5394040	Sorority life.
5394040	5398520	I, I played it for like a month and uh, I quit finally because I got really irritated
5398520	5403760	that whenever you log in, for some reason it would instantly put you up to the top of
5403760	5407120	other people's list of who wants to beat down this bitch.
5407120	5410680	And so like I would log in and within three seconds I would be out of energy because I
5410680	5414800	would basically get gang raped by all these blonde bitches the minute I log in.
5414800	5419540	So sorority life needed to give me at least like two minutes to bank my money or something,
5419540	5420540	but I didn't do that.
5420540	5423600	And that's my complaint with sorority life and I've totally wasted two minutes of your
5423600	5424600	life.
5424600	5425600	You're never going to get back.
5425600	5427280	Can I, can I keep going?
5427280	5428280	Yes.
5428280	5432840	Well play them also uses, um, social city also has, sorry, social city and market street.
5432840	5438600	You know, those are their other kind of big ones, but um, but Disney, Disney acquired
5438600	5439600	them.
5439600	5445600	It, it now has sorority life, so maybe we'll get, you know, princess sorority life.
5445600	5446840	Now that would bring me back.
5446840	5447840	I would play that.
5447840	5448840	Okay.
5448840	5449840	Just real quick.
5449840	5451800	I would like to see Belle give everyone the smack down.
5451800	5453640	She's the brainy woman.
5453640	5458280	Tiana being the new girl on the block is not old and aged like Belle, so she will beat
5458280	5459280	you all down.
5459280	5461000	There's Jasmine who probably has her whole.
5461000	5462360	Jasmine will just whine.
5462360	5466960	She'll just, you know, sic her tiger on people.
5466960	5468200	I want to have a tiger.
5468200	5471400	I want to be a princess with a tiger, Rob, not with a frog.
5471400	5473600	I thought you wanted a princess with a pony.
5473600	5477400	No tiger or a goat.
5477400	5478400	Wow.
5478400	5485280	Yeah, I'm, I'm officially decreeing the, the wah wah sound to SSJ Matt for a Facebook game,
5485280	5486720	getting FaceTime on the show.
5486720	5487720	Who would have thunk it?
5487720	5488720	Yeah.
5488720	5489720	He gets the wah wah sound.
5489720	5490720	I see what you did there.
5490720	5493280	I've, I've, um, I've bitched about how much I hate Farmville.
5493280	5494280	Oh God.
5494280	5496720	Don't get me started.
5496720	5500200	I'm playing hotel city and I actually like it.
5500200	5502720	You say that like it's supposed to make it better.
5502720	5503720	Like it's okay.
5503720	5504720	All right.
5504720	5505720	Anyhow.
5505720	5508160	Uh, hey, now how about a real game?
5508160	5509160	I like this.
5509160	5510160	This is awesome.
5510160	5515680	This game is called, there's an old school game, pengo K pengo was, let me see if I can
5515680	5518840	find some music from pengo cause pink pengo was pretty Epic.
5518840	5523200	Uh, back in the day it was this game where you would play a penguin and you walked around,
5523200	5529040	um, a maze and you could push ice blocks freaking hard too, but it's a lot of fun.
5529040	5531640	I don't, I don't remember what it's inspired by, but let's see.
5531640	5538080	Here's a, here's some of pengo.
5538080	5546520	So yeah, then you push these little ice blocks around and smoosh the guys in the stage.
5546520	5547520	It's a lot of fun.
5547520	5548520	It's cute.
5548520	5551920	It looks like pac man with a penguin and there's no dots either.
5551920	5554000	What are those green things trying to chase you?
5554000	5555440	The green things are, I guess trying to eat you.
5555440	5556440	I don't know.
5556440	5557440	Okay.
5557440	5558440	We recognize the music too.
5558440	5559440	Yeah.
5559440	5560440	That became later on.
5560440	5562000	I know I've heard it before.
5562000	5563080	What game was it in?
5563080	5564080	What other game was in?
5564080	5565080	DDR.
5565080	5566080	Oh, raver's choice.
5566080	5567080	Oh wow.
5567080	5568080	Well there anyway.
5568080	5569080	That's not the point.
5569080	5573080	The point is it's coming out on the PSP.
5573080	5574080	Yay.
5574080	5578080	Um, no, wait, no, I take that back.
5578080	5581560	It's actually, I'm sorry, no, this is something completely different.
5581560	5582560	I'm sorry.
5582560	5583760	It looked like a PSP screenshot at first.
5583760	5585440	It's actually an arcade game.
5585440	5589300	Uh, it's coming out in, uh, arcades in Japan.
5589300	5593600	It's going to be an eight player version, eight player, simultaneous penguins running
5593600	5594600	around the screen.
5594600	5595600	Yay.
5595600	5598440	It's not a graphical upgrade at all.
5598440	5599440	It's still, it's old school.
5599440	5601000	Hey, it's all about the gameplay.
5601000	5602880	So there you go.
5602880	5603880	That's really it.
5603880	5604880	That's all there is to say.
5604880	5606500	It's getting a new eight player version.
5606500	5610960	It's an upgrade there and uh, yeah, I'm, I'm all about checking that out when that comes
5610960	5611960	out.
5611960	5612960	That's going to be cute.
5612960	5615320	Uh, there's, they've really only teased it with one screenshot.
5615320	5616840	They really haven't said a lot else.
5616840	5621440	Uh, but apparently more information will come out on club Sega on August 6th.
5621440	5623440	That'd be pretty cool.
5623440	5624440	Yay.
5624440	5625440	Woo.
5625440	5626440	No, no, no.
5626440	5627440	That's speaking of classic games.
5627440	5630600	Speaking of Sega, I need to enlist the aid of the chat room because I used to know the
5630600	5633240	name of this game and for the life of me, I forgot about it.
5633240	5638120	Um, it's a Sega Saturn game that was visual, not visual.
5638120	5640720	It was audio only and you grew seeds with it.
5640720	5644480	A K the game came with a packet of seeds.
5644480	5646920	I've only seen it once in my life and I do not remember the name of it.
5646920	5649360	So if anyone can find the name of the game for me, please do.
5649360	5650360	So what?
5650360	5654400	It was like music to grow seeds by you'd have to, you would control the sound output from
5654400	5655640	it or something.
5655640	5656720	It was one of those bizarre games.
5656720	5659680	This guy's noted for super bizarre games.
5659680	5662120	Anyway, okay, continue Rob.
5662120	5665760	Okay, we're going to get into the classic game of the week as if that wasn't obscure
5665760	5666920	enough for you.
5666920	5669120	Now's the part of the show.
5669120	5674520	Dark Soccer likes to dig through the gaming vault and find a game that she says, hey,
5674520	5679560	you little children, babies of the world, including the new one born tonight.
5679560	5684320	Listen, babies, you should be, uh, schooled on these old games.
5684320	5687640	When I was your age, I played these games, right?
5687640	5688640	Dark Sakura.
5688640	5689640	Right.
5689640	5690640	You weren't really a baby.
5690640	5694920	You were probably like 15 when this particular game came out, but Hey, how old were you?
5694920	5697000	Um, I would have been, um, 20.
5697000	5698000	Oh wow.
5698000	5699000	No, no, I take that back.
5699000	5700000	I would have been 19.
5700000	5701000	All right.
5701000	5703160	Well enough talk about what you age you would have been.
5703160	5704320	Let's talk about what the game is.
5704320	5706320	What games did you pick for the folks tonight?
5706320	5709040	Guardian heroes.
5709040	5710040	Guardian heroes.
5710040	5714840	Um, if you will play the music, please, that's the character select.
5714840	5717640	I love Saturn music.
5717640	5725840	Anyway, yeah, the game came out on the Sega Saturn in 1996.
5725840	5730560	Actually it was kind of funny because this came out before it did in Japan.
5730560	5736080	It came out January 25th in America, January 26th in Japan, which I think might've actually
5736080	5741820	if, if I'm doing my no, cause then I was like, I'm trying to think about, you know, across
5741820	5746000	time zones if that would've been right, but no, I think Japan's a day ahead of us.
5746000	5747000	Yeah, it sounds right.
5747000	5748000	Yeah.
5748000	5753880	Um, anyway, um, it came out on the Sega Saturn and it was, um, kind of like what Golden Axe
5753880	5762340	was, um, sort of 2d side scrolling, beat them up, kind of punching things, you know, using
5762340	5764320	magic and swords and stuff.
5764320	5768800	Um, there was a sequel that came out in 2004 for the Game Boy Advance that was advanced
5768800	5777080	guardian heroes, but it's sort of a, an RPG touch to the beat them up, the genre.
5777080	5779800	As you can, those of us in here can tell on Bob's computer.
5779800	5780800	Oh, I like it.
5780800	5781800	I very much like it.
5781800	5786840	It's kind of got the, the, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles feel, you know, street fighter
5786840	5787840	2.
5787840	5788840	No, it's not a fighting game.
5788840	5794480	It's, it's a beat them up, sort of like how, uh, um, Final Fight and you know, Double Dragon.
5794480	5800320	Except this one has magic and swords, magic and swords, but there's no blood.
5800320	5807160	Anyway, um, going forward, um, it had a versus mode for you to pick up to six different characters
5807160	5808720	and compete with the main characters.
5808720	5815160	You get unlockable monsters, bosses, and civilians with the time to battle or to death.
5815160	5820240	You get experience points through each scene and you can customize your characters with,
5820240	5821720	um, six different attributes.
5821720	5827920	You have strength, vitality, intelligence, mentality, agility, and luck.
5827920	5833840	Um, it's actually luck is good for, um, the spell casters.
5833840	5837240	Anyway, um, there is of course the story mode.
5837240	5840440	Um, you can actually take different paths along the story.
5840440	5844080	So you've got different endings, different bosses, different levels.
5844080	5848000	You can, I mean basically it has a ton of replayability just because you can really
5848000	5849000	keep going.
5849000	5852040	In fact, this is one thing, and this is one thing that I know my husband loves about this,
5852040	5857720	is that, um, there's a path that will lead to gold and silver from Gunstar Heroes.
5857720	5858720	So that's pretty cool.
5858720	5861480	And keep in mind, this was put up by Treasure.
5861480	5865440	So it gets the, oh my God, Treasure Award too.
5865440	5874480	Um, and, uh, of course the gold and silver, um, as the final boss uses the, the gem power
5874480	5876480	like you did in Gunstar Heroes.
5876480	5883360	Um, you really can, um, it has multiple levels in the game.
5883360	5887080	You usually only have three planes of battle, the four, the mid, and the back.
5887080	5889920	Um, and you can switch them out in sequence.
5889920	5895360	Um, and there's also the shoulder buttons will make you move back and forth.
5895360	5903040	You also have eva- evasive moves, and, um, you also have, uh, um, like if you get surrounded
5903040	5904840	you can change your planes.
5904840	5907440	You can move to a foreground or background and whatnot.
5907440	5909280	So that's pretty cool.
5909280	5916160	Um, with the games you have Samuel Hahn, um, who is, uh, just a physical powerhouse type
5916160	5917160	of guy.
5917160	5923960	You have Randy M. Green, who, um, has some spells, uh, they're elemental magic.
5923960	5929360	Um, Jinjiro Ibushi, who is, um, more moving attacks.
5929360	5933040	Uh, Nicole Neal, who has different magic.
5933040	5937280	And Serena Corsair, who's supposed to be, um, just a knight.
5937280	5938280	Pretty, pretty well-rounded.
5938280	5947120	Um, so yeah, it's, it's the big game, it's, uh, a real- and also good luck freaking finding
5947120	5948120	it.
5948120	5950420	Now, in Japan it was common as derp.
5950420	5952040	I mean, super common.
5952040	5958880	In the U.S., not so much because, um, they really didn't release very many copies over
5958880	5963120	here and of course we didn't, um, you know, they, they released plenty of, uh, advanced
5963120	5964120	Guardian Heroes.
5964120	5969280	But the Saturn one in the U.S., pretty hard to find and it's got really crappy Americanized
5969280	5971280	artwork on the cover.
5971280	5976280	Makes me kinda sick, but apart from that, though, I mean, it's a pretty, pretty damn
5976280	5977280	good game.
5977280	5978280	Alright.
5978280	5979500	I'll leave the cover in the chatroom.
5979500	5983840	There it is, folks, for the Sega Saturn, your classic game of the week, Guardian Heroes.
5983840	5986960	Kind of a neat little, uh, combination there.
5986960	5988520	I like it when genres collide.
5988520	5992540	Well, and, and on top of that, it's treasure.
5992540	5995640	Is there a treasure game you haven't done at this point as a classic game of the week?
5995640	5998760	Well, I haven't done, like, Chameleon Twist or, um...
5998760	6001320	So that you, you guys can guess what'll be done for the...
6001320	6003200	I have, well, no, I might have to eventually do that.
6003200	6005200	Have I done, um, Silhouette Mirage?
6005200	6006840	I think I have done Silhouette Mirage.
6006840	6007840	You have to check the wiki.
6007840	6008840	I can't remember.
6008840	6009840	I have to look.
6009840	6012840	I mean, over, over 125 classic games of the week at this point.
6012840	6013840	Crazy.
6013840	6014840	Alright.
6014840	6017520	Anyhow, uh, we're gonna go ahead and take a break, but we'll be back.
6017520	6018520	I have done it.
6018520	6020520	There is plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio to come.
6020520	6023000	We're gonna talk about Microsoft Kinect in the next segment.
6023000	6026880	We're gonna talk about Silent Hill and a new comic book, apparently, coming out.
6026880	6029900	And yes, believe it or not, more Facebook games.
6029900	6031800	We have to talk about Zynga tonight.
6031800	6032800	I know.
6032800	6033800	I know.
6033800	6034800	Don't tune out.
6034800	6035800	I promise you.
6035800	6036800	Rob.
6036800	6037800	It's gonna be lol-tastic.
6037800	6041080	We're gonna be back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
6041080	6042080	Stay tuned.
6042080	6050800	Hello, everybody, and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.
6050800	6056280	We are taping live on this August 1st of 2010 here at Orange Lounge Radio headquarters,
6056280	6058220	live at allgames.com.
6058220	6061240	And today is actually a very special day in OLR history.
6061240	6065520	Loki is not here tonight because his baby boy was just born earlier this evening at
6065520	6067080	five, about five o'clock.
6067080	6070160	Joshua is the boy's name, in case you were wondering, and you didn't hear earlier in
6070160	6072160	the show.
6072160	6073300	So we won't have Loki.
6073300	6076080	We anticipate he'll be out about a month.
6076080	6077680	So I mean, I don't know.
6077680	6080540	Knowing him, he might try to come back next week, but hopefully he'll take some time off
6080540	6083460	to go be with the baby and his wife during this very awesome time.
6083460	6085120	So in the meantime, we have guests galore.
6085120	6088160	So we have a couple joining us in the studio tonight, so welcome back.
6088160	6089680	I hope you guys are having fun so far.
6089680	6090680	I'm having a blast.
6090680	6091680	Mila and Gary are here.
6091680	6092680	Yay.
6092680	6093680	I'm having an absolute blast.
6093680	6094680	Awesome.
6094680	6095680	This is so much fun.
6095680	6096680	Now I know why Drew comes.
6096680	6097680	He comes all the way through.
6097680	6098680	That's the best part.
6098680	6100200	We haven't even gotten emails or tweets.
6100200	6101560	We got Twitters to get to it a little bit.
6101560	6102560	But wait, there's more.
6102560	6103560	But wait, there's more.
6103560	6105240	In fact, you only got about five more minutes to get Twitter topics in.
6105240	6108200	I have not been able to do any plugs on Twitter tonight because I've been so busy.
6108200	6111240	So I don't know if we're going to have anything waiting for us there, but I'll look.
6111240	6113360	We have spam in French.
6113360	6115120	We get spam in French all the time.
6115120	6116120	I know.
6116120	6118080	I was just laughing because I can read it.
6118080	6119960	They think the show is based out of Quebec or something.
6119960	6120960	I don't know.
6120960	6124400	All right, let's get to some rapid, rapid news, some quick news that we like to go over
6124400	6128120	very quickly before we get to the Twitter topics tonight.
6128120	6131360	I'll start tonight since we don't have Loki.
6131360	6136720	We have some news about some Call of Duty, I guess, special edition games.
6136720	6138120	These are black ops.
6138120	6143160	There's going to be a prestige edition for 150 bucks and a hardened edition for 80 bucks.
6143160	6145200	I guess these are some rumors picked up.
6145200	6149480	It was on buy.com, but the listing was since pulled.
6149480	6154680	I can tell you this, though, the rumblings around and people that I know and, you know,
6154680	6157400	I got friends in low places and so forth.
6157400	6159840	Orange on Trady wants to tell you guys this is true.
6159840	6165000	These are happening, but I mean, also, that's kind of like telling you like rain will eventually
6165000	6166480	fall from the sky next month.
6166480	6169360	Of course, there's going to be limited editions of these huge games.
6169360	6170720	Shouldn't be a huge surprise.
6170720	6174640	Activision hasn't officially announced it yet, but they will prestige for 150 bucks,
6174640	6176560	hardened edition for $80.
6176560	6178440	Couldn't tell you what's in those.
6178440	6185400	Although we're hearing possibly like something about maybe a little car.
6185400	6186400	I don't know.
6186400	6188480	Take that with what you will.
6188480	6190120	This is one that Activision will talk about.
6190120	6194000	It is DJ Tiesto is actually joining DJ Hero 2.
6194000	6197400	He's actually going to be in the game as a playable character, and he's going to be doing
6197400	6198880	two new mixes in the game.
6198880	6200600	I think that's kind of rad.
6200600	6207800	No news yet as to exactly what he's doing, but there was a little video that was released,
6207800	6209760	so I'm not sure what this video shows us.
6209760	6213400	I think it just shows him in game, and it might be like playing one of his mixes here,
6213400	6219120	but they did release a little clip here from DJ Hero 2.
6219120	6223720	I'm trying to get a little more of it here in studio, but the first one was really awesome.
6223720	6225720	Oh, I love DJ Hero 1.
6225720	6227720	I'm a DJ.
6227720	6232000	Play for so many people.
6232000	6233720	I'm very lucky that I have that opportunity.
6233720	6234720	Nah, I don't want to hear the whole interview.
6234720	6235720	I was hoping to hear more of his music.
6235720	6238760	He'll be part of DJ Hero Gamers.
6238760	6241800	Alright, he'll be in DJ Hero, hooray for him.
6241800	6243600	Alright, also Kmart.
6243600	6247560	Wow, this is like three shows in a row we've actually had a Kmart story.
6247560	6249200	I don't get this.
6249200	6250560	When did Kmart become relevant?
6250560	6251560	I don't understand.
6251560	6252560	This is so weird.
6252560	6254880	Well, you know they've done the whole rebranding thing, so perhaps.
6254880	6258800	Well, they're really trying to appeal to the gamers, and this is a pretty big one.
6258800	6260960	This is a great way to appeal to gamers.
6260960	6262720	Sell stuff cheap.
6262720	6266360	The Wii console, down to $179.99 this week.
6266360	6267360	What is it?
6267360	6272920	A whole $20 off, but hey, that's 10% of the cost, so hard to complain about that.
6272920	6276920	By the way, the deal runs out tomorrow, so you better hurry up and get on that.
6276920	6277920	Aw, damn.
6277920	6279520	It just came right around the corner from my house.
6279520	6282720	Both the white and the black Wiis, just so you know.
6282720	6284440	I have no money, no.
6284440	6286840	Well, how about some other stuff?
6286840	6287840	How about it?
6287840	6288840	Yeah.
6288840	6289840	This makes me particularly happy.
6289840	6292840	In the rock band, we have Blondie.
6292840	6293840	Yay!
6293840	6294840	Ooh.
6294840	6298960	There's already a little Blondie in there, but I'm never gonna say no to more Blondie.
6298960	6302640	And also a group that I like, Family Force 5.
6302640	6303640	Money?
6303640	6309280	So, actually, so with this upcoming pack that's gonna be out on August 3rd, we have Rapture
6309280	6316520	for Blondie, Jesus Freak DC Talk, whatever, The Perfect Crime number 2, The Decemberists,
6316520	6322660	I Only Want You, Eagles of Death Metal, Saturday Morning Eels, Love Addict Family Force 5,
6322660	6328280	Sturm and Drang, KMFDM, and Bulletproof LaRue.
6328280	6329280	Shut up.
6329280	6330280	What, in rock band?
6330280	6331280	Mm-hmm.
6331280	6332280	We're getting Bulletproof?
6332280	6333280	Yeah.
6333280	6334280	I love that song.
6334280	6335280	Even though it's way overplayed on the radio right now.
6335280	6336280	Yay!
6336280	6337280	I loved it like nine months ago.
6337280	6338280	Awesome.
6338280	6339560	I'm getting DC Talk.
6339560	6340560	That's funny.
6340560	6341560	Oh, come on.
6341560	6343560	Let's give him a break.
6343560	6352400	ASRB has Fatal Labyrinth, which was a Sega Genesis game.
6352400	6358280	It's supposed to be set up on, well, it's on the PC downloads, but it's also gonna be
6358280	6364640	available for Wii, for the Virtual Console, and Mac, PS3, Xbox 360.
6364640	6366440	It's in the Genesis collection thingy.
6366440	6367440	Yes it is.
6367440	6368440	Don't bother.
6368440	6369440	In the Sonic Ultimate Genesis collection.
6369440	6371200	I mean, get the Sonic collection.
6371200	6375560	It's great, but don't bother with a $5 standalone release when you get that collection for $20.
6375560	6376560	It's great.
6376560	6377560	Mm-hmm.
6377560	6378560	And you get, like, tons of stuff right now.
6378560	6379880	Sometimes it is worth it to pay more.
6379880	6381280	And that game kind of blows.
6381280	6385000	I mean, I hate to say it, but it's kind of like somebody decided to port, I don't know
6385000	6388440	if you guys know Rogue, the old-ass game from, like, years and years ago.
6388440	6392240	Somebody decided to port Rogue to the Sega Genesis, and that's kind of what you got.
6392240	6393800	And Rogue is more fun.
6393800	6403800	Well, um, now also in other news, there is a mandatory update for PS3 firmware 3.41.
6403800	6410040	So it's gonna add in a You May Like section to the PlayStation Store.
6410040	6412040	And really, that's about it.
6412040	6414040	There's nothing else.
6414040	6415760	But it's mandatory.
6415760	6418720	That's like how Twitter now shows me people I ought to be following.
6418720	6420160	I don't give a crap.
6420160	6421160	Anyway.
6421160	6426120	I know, I'm like, a lot of these people I'm not following for a reason, just so you know.
6426120	6431160	All right, let's go to Twitter topics and visit the Tweeter and see who's sending us
6431160	6433960	messages.
6433960	6437040	Not a lot, because I forgot to put the call out on Twitter earlier this evening, because
6437040	6439160	I was kind of, you know, I had a lot going on.
6439160	6441240	You know, stuff and things and such as.
6441240	6445160	But we did, that did not stop some tweets from coming in, and we're very excited that
6445160	6447240	at least a handful of tweets are coming in.
6447240	6453280	First one from Tiger Claw, because he always will dig up a story that we somehow overlook.
6453280	6455800	And this is definitely one that I think is interesting, that we did overlook, and it
6455800	6460720	comes from the International Business Times that he's actually linking us to.
6460720	6466280	China is actually pushing a real name system for online games, and that starts today, August
6466280	6467280	1st.
6467280	6470020	You're gonna have to register using your real name if you want to play an online game.
6470020	6472360	This is like real ID gone wrong.
6472360	6473960	Really wrong.
6473960	6475300	That comes from the Ministry of Culture.
6475300	6481480	It was announced on June 22nd, and it's part of a nationwide campaign to improve management
6481480	6485760	of the virtual gaming industry and protect the minor from unwholesome content.
6485760	6488360	Well, you do realize this is China, right?
6488360	6490040	Yeah, I know, it's different.
6490040	6491720	It's obviously a lot different than real ID.
6491720	6498520	Well, they have some serious issues with people not managing their time well on these MMOs,
6498520	6499520	right?
6499520	6500520	So, I don't know.
6500520	6503560	I mean, but then again, we have some people with issues not managing their time well in
6503560	6507600	America as well, so it just seems to be a lot worse.
6507600	6509440	Some of the stories you hear are really, really scary over there.
6509440	6513120	I don't know what they're talking about, Shifty Eyes, Shifty Eyes.
6513120	6516600	But anyhow, how would you like it if they stepped in and said, hey, everybody's gonna
6516600	6518320	have to play online games with their real name.
6518320	6519320	Do not want.
6519320	6520320	Do not want.
6520320	6522320	Good luck with that, China.
6522320	6525760	All right, next up though, speaking of China, how about Chinatown?
6525760	6530000	Matt, sj100matt on Twitter actually wanted to link us to this.
6530000	6532840	He kind of wanted to give a shout out to one of his local arcades.
6532840	6537400	I've heard of this place, but I've never been, and he was very proud that Kotaku had featured
6537400	6541840	it this week, because you know, they're one of the big boy gaming blogs, and so they feature
6541840	6543400	stuff once in a while.
6543400	6547000	And they are talking about the Chinatown Fair Video Arcade.
6547000	6550680	It is located on Mott Street in New York City's Chinatown.
6550680	6557240	Apparently, it is also this environment that LGBT youth can just kind of be themselves.
6557240	6558560	Oh yeah, I read about that.
6558560	6565000	Kind of interesting that it's gaming and LGBT colliding, although I thought it was really
6565000	6566600	cool when I went to that place in Portland.
6566600	6569640	They had like an LGBT night once a month, which I thought was kind of fun.
6569640	6571040	All the gay gamers can get together.
6571040	6577200	You know, I really feel that they need to include the asexual on that list too.
6577200	6582020	Well there's a big old long string of alphabet soup, but you know, at some point it gets
6582020	6583020	too big.
6583020	6584020	You know what I mean?
6584020	6587840	But anyway, let's see, what else do I want to say?
6587840	6591300	They wrote this nice little article on it that talked about, you know, that basically
6591300	6594780	it's a very diverse place and all the customers are very valued.
6594780	6597760	As they should be, that's just good customer service folks.
6597760	6601000	So a quote from one of the patrons of the place, we get all sorts.
6601000	6605780	We got dudes that go to raves, we got anime nerds, otaku, we get professional players.
6605780	6609800	So it just sounds like this hodgepodge of just go play and have fun.
6609800	6611480	That's what video games should be about anyway.
6611480	6618360	It shouldn't even be about LGBT or raevars or otaku or whatever.
6618360	6619760	Just have fun.
6619760	6620760	Don't be a dick.
6620760	6621760	Yeah, exactly.
6621760	6624840	We got enough clicks in the real world.
6624840	6627600	Always remember rule one, don't be a dick.
6627600	6628600	Exactly.
6628600	6629600	Exactly.
6629600	6630600	Don't be a dick.
6630600	6632720	And don't bring your click into the virtual world.
6632720	6637760	And then lastly, Dark Tetsuya on the tweeters wants us to plug his latest retro review for
6637760	6639160	Mega Man on the site.
6639160	6642400	It's actually pretty awesome, so go check that out at orangeslunchradio.com.
6642400	6647920	Whole little, I don't want to say expose on Mega Man, but it's a nice little retrospective.
6647920	6650360	The original Mega Man games, I remember those very fondly.
6650360	6651360	They were awesome.
6651360	6655240	Oh man, you got to see some of the new ones, because the new ones are, they invoke the
6655240	6656680	old ones very well.
6656680	6657680	It's very cool.
6657680	6659040	Very, very cool.
6659040	6661600	All right, let's get back into some other news here.
6661600	6663520	I'm going to start off with a story on Kinect.
6663520	6667400	Kinect, of course, being the motion control device coming out from Microsoft.
6667400	6672920	We announced last week that it was going to be $150, although, obviously, speculation
6672920	6676160	had run rampant on that for a while.
6676160	6678160	It's coming with Kinect Adventures.
6678160	6681280	And of course, they got a lot of shit for that.
6681280	6683680	Well, I guess they came out this week.
6683680	6686160	It was the marketing manager, Brett Siddons.
6686160	6689080	He's the marketing manager for Microsoft Kinect.
6689080	6691080	He was at an event in the UK for Amazon.
6691080	6694880	He says that the Kinect is, quote, very competitively priced.
6694880	6698200	Now, since he was in the UK, he was talking about UK pricing.
6698200	6699200	But you know what?
6699200	6701400	It's all the same deal at the end of the day.
6701400	6706960	He's basically saying that the navigation controller is going to be an extra $30 on
6706960	6709000	top of the $100 bundle.
6709000	6713180	At least that is the Sony, you know, way of looking at things.
6713180	6717640	So I think we talked a little bit about price chart last week anyway that showed everything
6717640	6719040	kind of all in a row there.
6719040	6724520	And yeah, if you want to get the whole deal for PlayStation Move, it's a little bit more
6724520	6727900	expensive than Kinect, especially when it's two people.
6727900	6733320	So anyway, Microsoft is basically trying to say, hey, if you want two people to have fun,
6733320	6737560	you only need one Kinect, whereas with all these other systems, you need two of everything.
6737560	6739240	And we kind of knew they'd go this way.
6739240	6743160	And I think as we talked about last week a little bit, it's kind of like, well, but your
6743160	6748960	console then offsets the price of a Wii and it's really all about the games at the end
6748960	6749960	of the day, honestly.
6749960	6754480	I mean, you can charge plenty for this system as long as you have the games to back it up.
6754480	6758840	But if Dance Central is going to be your only good game, I don't know if it's worth the
6758840	6759840	time.
6759840	6766960	Of all the E3 games that I saw for the Kinect, the one that I really would love to go over
6766960	6774840	to a friend's house and play because I do not own a 360, God forbid, is the Children
6774840	6776240	of Eden.
6776240	6777320	Looks amazing.
6777320	6778320	It does look great.
6778320	6781080	It's too bad they didn't have a playable one on the show floor, so we don't know enough
6781080	6782080	about it.
6782080	6785240	If you can't imagine it's going to be Rez using your body, that's cool enough for me.
6785240	6788160	Yeah, that just looks absolutely amazing.
6788160	6789160	And so.
6789160	6790160	It'll be great.
6790160	6791160	All right.
6791160	6794480	Dr. Sakura, what do you got for us?
6794480	6795480	Stuff.
6795480	6798520	Well, this is actually pretty cool.
6798520	6806680	Silent Hill 8, the guy who's writing it, Tom Waltz, is also working on a comic book crossover
6806680	6809280	called Silent Hill Past Life.
6809280	6818920	But in 1867, and it was about an outlaw called Jebediah Foster, who meets a widow that changes
6818920	6820560	his ways.
6820560	6825640	And they move to Silent Hill to escape the Wild West.
6825640	6829560	But of course Silent Hill screws him over.
6829560	6835400	But it's that the game is going to feature a character from the comic, although the game
6835400	6838140	is in modern times.
6838140	6844760	So hey, I hope that they do better trailers out there for Silent Hill 8, and I really
6844760	6848560	need to sit down and watch it.
6848560	6850240	They showed a little bit at E3.
6850240	6852840	It looked all right.
6852840	6855560	I like that you have to put in your birthday.
6855560	6858120	Because it's restricted content, young lady.
6858120	6859120	I know.
6859120	6860120	All right.
6860120	6864160	Well, while she's watching that, I have to bring this up.
6864160	6868680	I apologize in advance, but let's all poke a little fun at Zynga this week.
6868680	6871600	Because they did something where they're getting a lot of shit for it.
6871600	6874600	So if you don't like Zynga, you can kind of like jump on the bandwagon with this.
6874600	6875600	It'll be fun.
6875600	6876600	Okay, here's the deal.
6876600	6877880	Zynga has this game on Facebook.
6877880	6879920	It's called Street Racing.
6879920	6884520	And they announced, with really no rhyme or reason, that they are shutting the game down
6884520	6887000	tomorrow, August 2nd.
6887000	6888640	I don't know what Street Racing is.
6888640	6889640	I've never played it.
6889640	6892400	I'm just going to guess it's Farmville with Cars.
6892400	6893400	Okay?
6893400	6894480	That's just my guess.
6894480	6897840	Or maybe it's like Mafia Wars, but with street cars.
6897840	6898960	Maybe it's like Fast and the Furious.
6898960	6899960	I don't know.
6899960	6903560	Regardless, whatever the reason, this game is being shut down tomorrow.
6903560	6905720	No rhyme or reason why they're doing it.
6905720	6911240	Now, if you know Zynga, part of the way they make money is that they try to get you to
6911240	6915080	buy shit in game with, you know, they pop up all these things about, you know, what
6915080	6918000	you can get for, you know, extra money.
6918000	6921040	If you give them money, you can get this in game.
6921040	6925200	And so a lot of people are wondering, well, if I paid money for Street Racing, which,
6925200	6929480	believe it or not, a lot of people did, what's going to happen?
6929480	6934120	Well, Zynga came out this week and said, quote, as an acknowledgement of the inconvenience
6934120	6938800	these changes may have caused, we have offered credits to all players who have made a purchase
6938800	6942040	in the last 90 days.
6942040	6944540	All right.
6944540	6948400	So these players will receive a credit for the exact amounts of their purchases, plus
6948400	6955280	an additional hundred units of premium currency in any of Zynga's nine most popular games.
6955280	6958880	So in other words, if you bought stuff, they're not going to refund you.
6958880	6963680	They're just going to let you have credits for other games.
6963680	6968740	What if I don't want those other games?
6968740	6972280	Although we can kind of sit here and kind of point and laugh and haha at Zynga and who
6972280	6976960	bought that shit anyway, it does kind of lead to this scary precedent.
6976960	6984240	For example, right now you can buy things in World of Warcraft, right?
6984240	6988960	And what if in World of Warcraft you buy, I don't know, like a pet?
6988960	6990920	What's going to happen when World of Warcraft goes away?
6990920	6997400	You lose that pet, which, you know, duh, you should know that games don't last forever
6997400	6998400	and so forth.
6998400	7002840	But it should be something you think about before you get these, you know, untangible
7002840	7003840	items.
7003840	7004840	Correct?
7004840	7007000	So this serves as a little bit of a lesson.
7007000	7012960	If ever this game decides to shut its doors, it's gone.
7012960	7015640	You know, there is a members runescape as well as a freerunscape.
7015640	7018920	Yes, I'm going back on a kick for about two seconds.
7018920	7023520	But if you run out of membership money and it boots you back into free world, you keep
7023520	7024980	all your stuff.
7024980	7027280	You just can't use anything.
7027280	7033220	So you keep all your members' stuff that you, you know, bought or acquired or whatever,
7033220	7038720	but it just stays in your bank and pretty much useless until you get more money.
7038720	7040760	So you don't lose it.
7040760	7049240	You don't lose it, which, you know, the whole thing that they're shutting it down, you know,
7049240	7053760	it's for no rhyme or reason, nothing.
7053760	7056480	They're not saying why Street Racer got shut down.
7056480	7060680	I'm wondering if it has to do with the fact that street racing is kind of like a, you
7060680	7064040	know, borderline legality type of thing, and maybe they're getting in shit because they're
7064040	7069360	promoting something that's, you know, kind of illegal in a way.
7069360	7072120	I wonder if that's, that's probably what it's about.
7072120	7075480	Anyhow, let's see.
7075480	7077760	Where are we at?
7077760	7080000	Comments in chatroom chat.orangelandtrady.com.
7080000	7084520	Bonds 006 says, but Neopets, Petpet, they live, I hope.
7084520	7087360	Neopets is another one of those sites that might go away someday.
7087360	7092240	Hitstun, if ever Xbox live goes offline, you can't play any of the Xbox live indie games
7092240	7093240	you bought.
7093240	7094240	Good point.
7094240	7097360	I mean, original Xbox was just shut down a couple months ago.
7097360	7101280	Does that mean in about five years, the Xbox we have now is also going to get shut down
7101280	7103700	and then all these indie games go wrong?
7103700	7106840	It's kind of funny because a lot of people were giving crap to on live.
7106840	7110480	The new service that's out to let you play games like through the streaming service.
7110480	7113800	Like you're going to buy this game for $50, but it's really only guaranteed to work for
7113800	7114800	three years.
7114800	7116840	Then they might pull the plug on, on live.
7116840	7121080	Whereas if you go to the store and buy a game for $50, you pretty much have it quote unquote
7121080	7123520	forever.
7123520	7124520	Just things to think about.
7124520	7128360	I don't know one way or the other.
7128360	7132720	It's kind of almost reminds me of the old school Nintendo, how they would, you know,
7132720	7137480	every time a new console would come out, you can't use the old school games in the new
7137480	7138480	console.
7138480	7143040	So it's like you just, you know, plunker down 15 bucks to buy that really awesome version
7143040	7144040	of Zelda.
7144040	7145040	That won't go in your Super Nintendo.
7145040	7146840	Yeah, nothing was backward compatible.
7146840	7151560	That's why I kind of stuck to the PlayStation series so I can play my old PlayStation games
7151560	7152560	on the PS2.
7152560	7155920	I guess they're all backward compatible with the PS3 too.
7155920	7159740	PS1 is, but you, and this is what doesn't make sense about Sony.
7159740	7164480	It depends what console you got and how early you bought a PS3 if you can backwards compatible
7164480	7165480	or can't.
7165480	7166480	I think she can, but I can't.
7166480	7170560	I can because I got, we have a first release PS3.
7170560	7174620	They took out a lot of the extra bells and whistles with later releases.
7174620	7178160	So if I bought a PS3 now I wouldn't be able to, he probably couldn't do jack shit.
7178160	7182240	No sir, not unless you got really lucky in finding a used one and a lot of people jack
7182240	7184480	up the prices of those that are backwards compatible.
7184480	7185480	Thanks.
7185480	7190240	You know what's extra funny is that usually Dan and I wait until second releases come
7190240	7195920	out for when we get stuff because we're usually not initial adopters of consoles and phones
7195920	7200760	and stuff, but we got this right away and we sort of got a reward because our Discover
7200760	7203420	card gave us back a hundred bucks.
7203420	7205560	So would a new PS3 let you play a PS2 game?
7205560	7208040	Cause I know they still sell PS2 games.
7208040	7209040	Nope.
7209040	7212080	However, I think I've got an extra PS2 you could probably borrow.
7212080	7216660	But you can play, you can play PS1 games.
7216660	7217660	And imports, right?
7217660	7218660	Import PS1 games.
7218660	7219660	Uh, no.
7219660	7224240	The region locks are still in place for PS1 and PS2, but it's region free for the new
7224240	7225240	games.
7225240	7226240	That's right.
7226240	7227240	PS3 games are region free.
7227240	7228240	Yeah.
7228240	7234040	Which is interesting, but you might remember like Loki imported a, uh, uh, racing game
7234040	7237460	that he thought was awful, but he imported it.
7237460	7242480	So the, and the exciting thing is if BeatMania 2DX ever comes out on the PlayStation 3, you
7242480	7246720	know, that was a, I know that was the game that made me buy a Japanese PlayStation 2
7246720	7247720	so I could play it.
7247720	7248720	Same here.
7248720	7250640	That's how obsessed with this music game series I was.
7250640	7254300	If they do release that on PS3 in the future, which I hope they will, it's going to break
7254300	7257080	down that, that border essentially.
7257080	7260960	And if I want to just import it from a Japanese retailer, I'll be able to play it on my PS3.
7260960	7265500	I won't have to spend another $400 on an extra place to, and yes, I spent like 400 bucks
7265500	7268120	on a Japanese PS2 just so I could play the stupid game.
7268120	7270040	Yeah, we, we did ours too.
7270040	7271040	I know.
7271040	7272040	Yeah.
7272040	7273040	A lot of people did.
7273040	7274040	It wasn't just me.
7274040	7276260	I still have my old clunker at home.
7276260	7280360	My wonderful, the original PS2 box.
7280360	7284780	Props to those PS2s for holding up after all those years, cause I believe we heard a Bobby
7284780	7288460	on the show right before us talking about his Xbox 360 red ringed.
7288460	7293240	One of my friends just sent me a text over the weekend, my 360 red ringed frown face.
7293240	7294600	They don't build them like they used to.
7294600	7295600	No they don't.
7295600	7301000	My PS2 is still up and going because I don't use it that much, mostly for DVDs, but yeah,
7301000	7302160	it still works.
7302160	7305760	I'm not, I'm not real confident about Sony optical drives.
7305760	7308080	Just bad experiences, but we'll see how long it lasts.
7308080	7309640	So far, so good.
7309640	7312200	Breslull's in our chat and says, I still want to get a JPS2.
7312200	7314840	Well, the good news is it's really cheap now.
7314840	7319560	You probably get it for only about a hundred now, maybe 120, 150 for Japanese PlayStation
7319560	7320560	2.
7320560	7321560	Yes.
7321560	7324240	But keep in mind, if you import a console from Japan, it's only going to play the Japanese
7324240	7325240	games.
7325240	7328520	So there's gotta be something out there that you can't get here.
7328520	7329800	Like dating Sims.
7329800	7335480	All right, let's go to our mailbag.
7335480	7337480	Let's see if some of the faces have changed in our mailbag.
7337480	7340360	We're talking about some things never change.
7340360	7342020	Let's see about the emails.
7342020	7344400	Mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com if you want to send us an email.
7344400	7346240	I think we've got quite a few this week, right, Jamie?
7346240	7348000	Uh, a few more, yeah.
7348000	7352240	Hello, this is your friendly neighborhood Mexican, except in Arizona, act daft.
7352240	7355200	First of all, very late congrats on your eighth anniversary.
7355200	7356200	Keep up the good work.
7356200	7357520	Thank you, sir.
7357520	7361300	Now that I said that, I want to comment on some stuff you talked about on your last show.
7361300	7363840	First about the Kinect and the move.
7363840	7365800	You asked people if they're going to buy either of them.
7365800	7369840	I'll probably get the Kinect later when it gets cheaper because I don't really, because
7369840	7373760	I really want to try both Dance Central and Dance Master, and probably other games that
7373760	7376120	Microsoft may release in the future.
7376120	7378720	And Kinect does really look awesome.
7378720	7381080	But the move, first of all, I don't own a PS3 yet.
7381080	7385320	So before I get the move, I need a really good reason to get a PS3, which right now
7385320	7386320	is nothing.
7386320	7391360	Granted, there are a few PS3 exclusive games I do want, but they don't justify a reason
7391360	7392840	to get the console.
7392840	7397560	So before Sony tries to sell me a peripheral for any game at all, they should be working
7397560	7401840	on selling me the console itself, because like Loki said, the move is just going to
7401840	7403960	be the Wii with pretty graphics.
7403960	7406620	And I already have a Wii that I barely use.
7406620	7412680	I consider that their, excuse me, that their biggest problem and why the move may fail.
7412680	7416600	And the PlayStation Network in Mexico and other Latin American countries sucks.
7416600	7421160	Seriously, little to no content at all, and they want me to pay for a Plus service too?
7421160	7422160	Yeah, right.
7422160	7425320	Wow, this is a long email.
7425320	7428160	Another thing that you discussed was controllers versus keyboards and mouse.
7428160	7431720	I really think it comes down to what you're playing and how you're playing.
7431720	7435160	For first person shooters, sure, keyboard and mouse are way better because of precision
7435160	7439640	and other stuff, but for platformers or action games, I prefer controllers since it will
7439640	7443720	give more comfort and allow you to do more stuff like jumping and attacking.
7443720	7447680	I'm going to put two games as an example, Mirrors Edge and Psychonauts.
7447680	7451720	Mirrors Edge, while you can play with a keyboard and mouse just fine, there are a lot of button
7451720	7455480	combinations that are easier to do with a controller, and with Psychonauts, the game was designed
7455480	7459960	for consoles, so the keyboard controls are just plain awkward.
7459960	7464440	There are games that are easier with keyboard and mouse like Team Fortress 2 and Left 4 Dead,
7464440	7469040	not to mention point and click adventures, western RPGs, strategy games, or MMOs.
7469040	7473680	So I think you just need to learn both ways of controlling games and get the hang of both.
7473680	7477000	There's no better way of playing games in general, just a more comfortable way to play
7477000	7480040	certain games, which I agree with, by the way.
7480040	7484720	So that's all I want to say, thanks for reading, until next time, PS, sorry my lack of articles
7484720	7489240	on the OLR main page, but no internet at home makes it difficult to do so, PSS, suck at
7489240	7491640	Arizona and your racist laws.
7491640	7493640	Deft is kabrown.
7493640	7502200	Um, well, I think, especially the keyboard mouse part, I think a lot of the debate usually
7502200	7506360	is around first person shooters, but definitely you bring up a good point about, you know,
7506360	7510160	it really depends on the type of game you're playing, absolutely, is that keyboard mouse
7510160	7514880	ain't gonna cut it, I think, as well for a game like Psychonauts, but for me, I don't
7514880	7517920	know if it's because, I don't even know how to explain it.
7517920	7521220	Like I used to play Quake just fine with keyboard and mouse, but some of these new games are
7521220	7526600	just too many buttons, where, I know, I know, but yet when I hold a controller in my hand,
7526600	7527600	it makes sense.
7527600	7530360	I can't explain it, I don't expect anyone else to understand it, just the way it is
7530360	7531360	for me.
7531360	7535880	I'll tell you what's funny is that when I was playing PSO, I could not, I mean you can
7535880	7539840	play it with a keyboard, it just was much more comfortable with a controller.
7539840	7542880	But Final Fantasy XI, everyone was saying, why aren't you playing with a keyboard, why
7542880	7545440	aren't you using a keyboard, why aren't you using a keyboard, I'm like, because I can
7545440	7547440	do just fine with my controller.
7547440	7550880	I wanted one for World of Warcraft, I hate playing World of Warcraft because I hate playing
7550880	7551880	it on the keyboard.
7551880	7554680	What about Star Trek Online, isn't that all keyboard?
7554680	7560200	It is, but for some reason, it's, when you get into space combat, it really helps to
7560200	7562880	have a mouse.
7562880	7564200	Interesting.
7564200	7571680	Because you can rotate your camera with it, as well as do direct targeting.
7571680	7576640	As well as the difference between, you know, even different versions of the same game,
7576640	7580120	like the different Wii versus, you know, PlayStation versions.
7580120	7584840	Like I played the original PlayStation 2 version of Okami, yay!
7584840	7585920	Fun game.
7585920	7592700	And then I played the Wii re-release, and surprisingly, I liked the PlayStation 1 better.
7592700	7600980	Because the Wii remote, I don't know what it was, it just felt more clunky.
7600980	7602320	You know what I mean?
7602320	7608480	It felt like it was rushed, it felt like it was, you know, it was, they were just trying
7608480	7613440	to hurry it out as fast as they could, and they didn't bother with the calibration that
7613440	7616460	they needed to make it good.
7616460	7618120	With PlayStation 2, you don't have that problem.
7618120	7620800	You do not have that problem with Okami.
7620800	7622800	So.
7622800	7625200	How about the next email?
7625200	7627200	We're fond of calling it the Wii-mote.
7627200	7631440	Instead of Wii remote, we call it the Wii-mote.
7631440	7632440	Wii-mote?
7632440	7633440	Wii-mote?
7633440	7634440	Ok.
7634440	7635440	I don't know this.
7635440	7637440	I don't own one.
7637440	7640320	Good morning, everyone.
7640320	7641320	This is Jeet.
7641320	7642320	It's the other Swede.
7642320	7644320	Writing in once again.
7644320	7647400	This time I'd like to comment a bit on the discussion that was brought forth last time
7647400	7650840	concerning the accuracy and comfort when it comes to controllers.
7650840	7654320	Now I could start a five page rant about why a mouse and keyboard is far superior to any
7654320	7656800	console controllers, but I won't.
7656800	7661080	The reason is that I am very biased, and due to that bias, I can't objectively say that
7661080	7662440	a mouse is better.
7662440	7665800	It's only a personal preference embedded in me during my childhood thanks to my uncle
7665800	7668000	who introduced me to PC gaming.
7668000	7672040	It's simple, whatever controller you like, be it an Xbox 360 controller, PlayStation
7672040	7676600	Move, or mouse, it's only the best peripheral for you personally, not the whole world and
7676600	7677600	everyone in it.
7677600	7678600	Thank you.
7678600	7684600	To sum it up, the discussion of what control method is the quote best is pointless since
7684600	7687720	it all comes down to what you are skilled at using or prefer.
7687720	7691680	P.S. note that I didn't apologize for any spelling errors this time.
7691680	7695120	That's because I realized it's rude for someone who grew up with English as their primary
7695120	7699440	language to come into the minor flaws of someone who learned it as a second language.
7699440	7702040	Let's see you typing a letter to me in Swedish without grammatical errors in it.
7702040	7703760	I still love you, even you Dark Sakura.
7703760	7704760	Aww.
7704760	7709560	Anyway, if I know someone's typing from another country, I don't give them a hard time.
7709560	7710560	If I know.
7710560	7712560	If I don't, I'm sorry.
7712560	7713560	P.S.S.
7713560	7715880	Thanks for reading my letter and I hope your hand is feeling better.
7715880	7718120	Thank you, but it's not.
7718120	7723520	Drew Nami in our chatroom at chat.orangetownstrader.com says, IKEA controller for the Swedish email.
7723520	7724520	There you go.
7724520	7725520	Uh huh.
7725520	7726520	Uh huh.
7726520	7730320	And yeah, apparently it's international email night at Orange Island Radio, but hey, that's
7730320	7733080	awesome to know that we have listeners all over the globe.
7733080	7734080	That's so awesome.
7734080	7735080	Alright.
7735080	7736080	Next email.
7736080	7737080	Hey Orange Lounge.
7737080	7738080	Long time listener.
7738080	7739080	First time responder.
7739080	7740080	Oooh.
7740080	7741560	We got the cliche.
7741560	7742560	Love it.
7742560	7747080	As for the move, personally I think it will be the better motion control option.
7747080	7751360	Yes, the price point is high, but I think it will be the most accurate on the most powerful
7751360	7752880	system of the three.
7752880	7757120	I saw some great screen tests demonstrating its abilities and I think it could be a hardcore
7757120	7758800	alternative to the Wii.
7758800	7760400	That's the main reason I have avoided the Wii.
7760400	7762080	It lacks the hardcore devotions.
7762080	7763080	No five.
7763080	7769600	Just playing devil's advocate to your email, I kind of get that perspective and that's
7769600	7774040	why a lot of people have avoided the Wii, but what about games like Brawl and Metroid
7774040	7776960	Other M and some of these other kind of like, and GoldenEye, some of these are the cool
7776960	7780800	things that are on the Wii, I mean is that not hardcore enough?
7780800	7781800	No more heroes?
7781800	7787040	Yeah, I mean, I don't know, it's kind of like, it feels like there's some cool stuff on the
7787040	7791240	Wii, I mean granted maybe not as much, and yeah, Wii kind of made some errors when it
7791240	7795720	comes to not being online, I think that's one of their biggest flaws is that the multiplayer
7795720	7800120	online is just a joke, you know, compared to what else is out there.
7800120	7802640	I agree.
7802640	7804280	But appreciate the perspective.
7804280	7805760	We have two more emails to go.
7805760	7806760	No!
7806760	7807760	Too bad!
7807760	7810800	Hello, OLR, I have been listening for about three months and I love the show, although
7810800	7814560	I must admit that I'm not a music game person myself, I'd much rather RPGs but teach their
7814560	7815560	own.
7815560	7817000	I'm dropping this to you for three reasons.
7817000	7820600	First I was wondering what job Loki has that he's able to play Xbox at work.
7820600	7821600	Would love that job.
7821600	7825120	Second, he's not using any periods by the way.
7825120	7828240	Oh, that's why you sound like an auctioneer.
7828240	7829240	Yes.
7829240	7832680	Second is I was wondering if there was a way to get the livestream via mobile platform,
7832680	7833680	i.e. a moto-droid.
7833680	7839320	Third, is actually two things in the first letting, being that Dark Soccer is a fiend
7839320	7842320	for grammar, spelling, and punctuation, I thought it might interest her to know that
7842320	7847080	this site has lasted, has several, lastly I wonder what point during this email she
7847080	7849040	stops reading this and starts to have convulsions.
7849040	7853080	As I've written this without punctuation and have made several misspellings and several
7853080	7856520	grammatical errors on purpose, not that I don't like her or anything, I just thought
7856520	7859920	that it might get a giggle, good times all and keep up the good work.
7859920	7867120	I had to figure, I figured by then it was, hey you did, you did use a punctuation mark.
7867120	7871120	You gotta laugh out of me anytime somebody writes in to give Dark Soccer some shit, I
7871120	7872120	love it.
7872120	7876760	No, I'm laughing at this because I realized by that point that it was on purpose.
7876760	7879120	So this is a punctuation troll.
7879120	7884680	Wow, we have our first grammar troll on Orange Lounge Radio, that's awesome.
7884680	7885680	You get a gold star.
7885680	7886680	You totally get a gold star.
7886680	7890920	And this is from Kane I Am, I didn't sign it but I'm taking it from the email.
7890920	7895640	Kane I Am, you get a gold star for being the first grammar troll at Orange Lounge Radio.
7895640	7898440	And the subject of the subject is Wee Yay Wahoo.
7898440	7902400	Please, that is not encouraging others to copy what this gentleman has done.
7902400	7906480	Yeah, because if you do it the first time, you're clever, anyone who does it the second
7906480	7907480	time is stupid.
7907480	7910120	Alright, what was the real question here though?
7910120	7913040	There was something in there I actually wanted to answer that had come up in there.
7913040	7914440	Oh, Loki's Job.
7914440	7915880	He works for a game distributor.
7915880	7922480	So he actually, like he's kind of the middle man between gaming companies and the actual
7922480	7923480	stores.
7923480	7924480	Yeah.
7924480	7929320	Because it's very hard for a gaming company to manage all these stores directly, so they
7929320	7931720	use distributors to kind of be the middle men.
7931720	7934400	And that's basically what he does, he works for the distributor.
7934400	7936320	And then there was something right after that about...
7936320	7939680	About being able to listen to us on mobile, because he's got a Moto Droid 3rd.
7939680	7940680	Okay, I...
7940680	7942680	Sorry, a Moto Droid.
7942680	7945160	We have, well I know that for iPhone we use apps.
7945160	7951640	There's an all games app on the iPhone supposedly, but I guess it disappeared this week, so I
7951640	7953480	don't know what's going on there.
7953480	7957040	That's a Scott question, not a Rob question, so I don't know.
7957040	7961880	But I will say this, any program that can use Shoutcast can listen to the all game stream.
7961880	7965440	You just have to get the link for the Shoutcast feed, it's a little silly for me to yell it
7965440	7966440	out here.
7966440	7969200	I think Pandora has a...
7969200	7970200	Go to all...
7970200	7971200	Well Pandora's...
7971200	7972200	Does it have Shoutcast mode in it though?
7972200	7973200	I don't know.
7973200	7974200	I don't know.
7974200	7978000	But most mobile phones have some type of Shoutcast tuner app, I mean anything that's like, listen
7978000	7981640	to thousands of internet radio stations, it's probably a Shoutcast app.
7981640	7986320	And if you go to allgames.com you can get the link to listen to all games radio.
7986320	7987320	Yeah.
7987320	7988320	Pretty easy.
7988320	7991680	Okay, and then the grammar thing.
7991680	7995000	Which I'm laughing, I'm actually laughing, because I realized it was on purpose.
7995000	7996000	How funny, Tiger...
7996000	7998720	I'm sorry, I have to say this, Tigercall on our chatroom is saying since the all games
7998720	8002880	app isn't up right now, you can get the Video Game Outsiders iPhone app, because they're
8002880	8005420	another show on the network, they do Tuesdays here.
8005420	8008440	And I guess their app does it.
8008440	8009440	That's cool.
8009440	8011160	So, I guess a backup.
8011160	8015480	Okay, and the last one.
8015480	8017760	Greetings OLR, Rini here.
8017760	8022020	I will soon be the proud owner of a new Beatles Rock Band limited edition bundle that I scored
8022020	8023020	for 20 bucks.
8023020	8024020	Wow.
8024020	8028400	I have not owned a Rock Band game until now, so I was wondering if you and the listeners
8028400	8034400	could give any advice on what I should know about keeping my gear in great condition.
8034400	8040160	I would say, sanitize it if other people play it.
8040160	8043400	Especially if they have greasy fingers.
8043400	8046320	Or liquor is being mixed with those controllers.
8046320	8047320	Seriously.
8047320	8054400	Yes, those monitor wipes that you can use to clean your computer screen, those might
8054400	8055480	be good for it.
8055480	8058080	Alcohol prep pads, yo.
8058080	8059440	Because alcohol just dries.
8059440	8061600	Clorox wipes are like the greatest invention ever.
8061600	8063040	Yeah, but you gotta be careful with those.
8063040	8065480	That's true, you don't want to bleach your controllers like a sister.
8065480	8069600	The horrible thing is, when you said, you know, if alcohol is being mixed with us drinks,
8069600	8076360	I got this horrible mental image of a Rock Band controller mixing a giant vat of alcohol.
8076360	8078520	I wouldn't use it for that purpose.
8078520	8082160	You must hate your Rock Band if you're doing that, wow.
8082160	8088760	And also, when you store them, make sure that you don't have them stacked up haphazardly.
8088760	8094600	We usually stand ours up on end and put them in a corner to where they won't really fall
8094600	8095600	on each other.
8095600	8098280	If you really want to take good care of them, and this is the way to do it, just go get
8098280	8101500	one of those big plastic storage tubs at Target.
8101500	8103320	It would cost you only a couple bucks.
8103320	8106840	IKEA would have them too, any place ought to have it.
8106840	8112320	You can just get a big storage tub and put your drum kit and your guitar in there, and
8112320	8117000	then that way it won't get a crap ton of dust on it, it won't be left out to be kicked and
8117000	8118560	pushed around and fall over.
8118560	8123320	With all my Baymani stuff, we would typically just put them back in the box.
8123320	8124320	That's dedication.
8124320	8128840	I don't know if, especially I think the guitar is in pieces in the Rock Band box, I want
8128840	8129840	to say.
8129840	8130840	I don't know if I'd want to put it back together.
8130840	8135560	We can do that with our Rock Band ones, but for the ones that we could, we would do that.
8135560	8138280	Plastic tubs, if you have the space for it, would be great.
8138280	8142520	Of course I will be getting Rock Band, Rock Band 2, and Lego Rock Band very soon, so please
8142520	8145960	kindly randomly blurt out any good download content songs.
8145960	8146960	Thanks.
8146960	8147960	P.S.
8147960	8149720	Give Dark Sakura more ginger ale, dude.
8149720	8152160	Don't stop believin'.
8152160	8153160	Is really all you need.
8153160	8155120	Skullcrusher Mountain.
8155120	8157400	Definitely look for the free stuff on the marketplace.
8157400	8158640	Jonathan Coulton stuff.
8158640	8160440	It's really about what type of music you're into.
8160440	8162960	And Stephen Colbert.
8162960	8163960	Lady Gaga.
8163960	8164960	Blah.
8164960	8165960	Blah yourself.
8165960	8166960	Haters.
8166960	8167960	Haters.
8167960	8168960	Haters.
8168960	8169960	We're not...
8169960	8170960	Haters gonna hate, Rob.
8170960	8171960	Haters gonna hate.
8171960	8172960	That's right.
8172960	8173960	Oh boy.
8173960	8174960	That's it.
8174960	8175960	You can't...
8175960	8176960	Stop the hate.
8176960	8177960	That's right.
8177960	8182360	I have actually said this, Rob, and I made this statement clear when we went out to Vick's
8182360	8188600	Ice Cream downtown, that I do not dislike Lady Gaga.
8188600	8193920	I dislike the radio versions of her songs, but every time I've heard piano versions,
8193920	8195560	I've really liked them.
8195560	8196560	Okay.
8196560	8197560	Okay.
8197560	8198560	So, it's...
8198560	8199560	No one-ker.
8199560	8205680	I thought you just disliked the performance art aspects of her videos.
8205680	8206680	Videos get you...
8206680	8210200	Well, I don't like her videos, but I mean, I like the video for Alejandro.
8210200	8213360	I don't like the videos, but the songs are pretty awesome.
8213360	8214360	I like video games.
8214360	8215360	All right, let's...
8215360	8216480	Yes, let's go on.
8216480	8217880	I also like Angst.
8217880	8222360	What a perfect segue into our FUs of the week.
8222360	8224360	Yay.
8224360	8240280	And now, for those new to Orange Lounge Radio, this is the part of the show where we just
8240280	8244960	say a big FU to whatever we're going to say an FU to all week, Dark Soccer.
8244960	8250520	FU to the hole in my hand, and to my husband's blood pressure.
8250520	8256040	We're going to beat you, butthead, okay.
8256040	8260400	I'm going to give an FU to all the sand in my hypothetical vagina that I apparently have
8260400	8261400	today.
8261400	8262400	I just...
8262400	8266880	Are you feeling a little gritty and not so fresh?
8266880	8268880	Yes.
8268880	8276200	I have to say a big FU to any gaming company who is willing to charge multiple dollars
8276200	8279120	for copies of games that I already own.
8279120	8283600	Yes, I'm talking to you, PlayStation.
8283600	8290000	Okay, the biggest FU, well, general FUs all around to...
8290000	8291720	Let's see, the list is long and distinguished.
8291720	8292720	We'll keep it short.
8292720	8298240	Fox News, Sarah Palin, Meg Whitman, boo!
8298240	8299240	Carly Fiona?
8299240	8300240	Oh God, no.
8300240	8301480	I thought you were keeping it short.
8301480	8303680	Yeah, yeah, I am keeping it short.
8303680	8308280	And the whole Republican Party, go rot, FU.
8308280	8309920	That won't generate any emails tonight.
8309920	8314240	By the way, by the way, by the way, Rob, as an official woman, you can have an honorary
8314240	8315240	veg.
8315240	8318360	Oh yay, just I've always wanted...
8318360	8319880	You can keep it.
8319880	8321760	These things are nothing but trouble.
8321760	8326800	So you don't have to have a hypothetical one, you can have an honorary one.
8326800	8327800	I don't want one.
8327800	8328800	What's the difference?
8328800	8329800	I...
8329800	8330800	They're both non-existent.
8330800	8334520	Send it back, return to sender.
8334520	8335520	The warranty experience, sorry.
8335520	8336520	Do not want.
8336520	8341120	Rob's pet vag.
8341120	8342120	My little vag.
8342120	8345800	Hmm, there's a product idea for Hasbro.
8345800	8346800	What?
8346800	8348800	Imagine vagina.
8348800	8355400	All right, anyhow, let's move on.
8355400	8359920	Loki is in our chat room right now, he's in the chat, he joined on the hospital Wi-Fi.
8359920	8360920	He's in chat right now.
8360920	8363080	Woot for free Wi-Fi, I second that.
8363080	8367520	I don't know if he's listening or what, I just sent him a private message if I can call
8367520	8370920	him, but I don't know if he can see, he probably can't hear.
8370920	8377920	Free slow Wi-Fi, that's what you get when it's free Wi-Fi, it's slow Wi-Fi.
8377920	8381200	I don't know, so we'll see if we can call him or not, we'll see.
8381200	8383400	But for now we're gonna keep on moving with the news.
8383400	8389120	Ah, let's see, Metroid Other M, now here's a Wii game that's gonna be pretty hardcore
8389120	8393160	for that person earlier, but yeah, I'm excited about this game, I'm finally gonna dust off
8393160	8395400	the Wii after like six months of not playing it.
8395400	8398500	This is kind of an interesting mode they're putting in the game, it's gonna be a theater
8398500	8404640	mode in Metroid Other M. That's right, if you wanna just watch the movie Metroid Other
8404640	8406600	M, you can do that.
8406600	8411080	That's right, there's a theater mode according to one of the designers at Nintendo, Yoshio
8411080	8414920	Sakamoto, there's a theater mode that lets you view all of the cutscenes linked together
8414920	8417160	seamlessly as a single movie.
8417160	8420840	We placed just as much weight on enjoying the story as we did on the action aspects
8420840	8425520	of the game, but it's hard to fully communicate a storyline in a video game with just one
8425520	8426520	playthrough.
8426520	8430400	At the same time though, it's asking a lot of players to beat the game twice to get it
8430400	8433280	all, so that's where the idea for that mode came from.
8433280	8436960	It lets you make a lot of discoveries, things you missed, or dialogue that makes more sense
8436960	8438160	in retrospect.
8438160	8442040	I hope it helps people understand the story better.
8442040	8443040	Interesting approach.
8443040	8444040	Nice!
8444040	8451280	That almost kind of reminds me of Final Fantasy X, they had the theater that was in Luka that
8451280	8455320	you could go to and buy the individual cutscenes, which was really nice when you wanted to look
8455320	8456320	at them all together.
8456320	8459480	Yeah, and I was gonna say, people have been kind of doing this whole cutscene movie thing
8459480	8464380	for years, like I'm pretty sure I could probably go on YouTube and just see nothing but cutscenes
8464380	8468240	from some of the more recent Final Fantasy games, get a pretty good sense of what the
8468240	8469240	story's all about.
8469240	8473640	So, kind of interesting that the game is now officially endorsing that idea, but I like
8473640	8475280	his reasoning behind it.
8475280	8478120	He's just kind of like, you know what, you shouldn't have to beat the game twice to get
8478120	8480320	everything.
8480320	8485660	And you might kind of go, it's Nintendo Easy Mode, just hit the button or whatever, but
8485660	8489880	you know, I'll give him a little credit.
8489880	8493120	I think something as epic as Metroid is worthy of a theater mode.
8493120	8497360	So is it cheating if you watch the whole movie first and then you play the game?
8497360	8501480	Yes, but in my opinion that's no worse than going on the internet and reading the entire
8501480	8502960	FAQ before you play the game.
8502960	8503960	Good point.
8503960	8504960	Yeah, true.
8504960	8506440	I mean, is it really any worse?
8506440	8510280	So, I'm okay with it.
8510280	8513560	Let's see, Tigerclaw says, now the question is how long is the theater mode?
8513560	8516600	Usually cutscenes, when you add them all together, they aren't usually an hour.
8516600	8518340	They're saying two hours.
8518340	8521540	Two hours is divided into chapters just like a DVD.
8521540	8528480	It's not just the cutscenes, there's actually prerecorded gameplay that will be intertwined
8528480	8529480	with it.
8529480	8534920	Although, I guess at one point they wanted to actually have recorded bits of you playing
8534920	8539440	the game that would then go into theater mode, but it's too big of a pain in the ass, basically,
8539440	8540440	and I'll tell you why.
8540440	8542920	It's because there's no decent storage on the Wii.
8542920	8545360	Even though it's not what they're saying, I'm totally filling in the gaps there and
8545360	8547640	making it up, it's got to be the reason.
8547640	8549020	You can't store that information.
8549020	8551160	But it is watching an actual movie.
8551160	8552160	Pretty much.
8552160	8553160	That's kind of cool.
8553160	8554160	That's nice.
8554160	8555160	I mean, how many people are perfectly content?
8555160	8559760	DarkSakura comes in here and a lot of her gaming weeks usually are, I watched Dan play
8559760	8560760	blank.
8560760	8564040	There's a lot of people that game by watching other people game.
8564040	8569200	Well, yeah, I mean, part of it for me is that he'll play a lot of single player stuff and
8569200	8573480	loves to just, you know, completely dominate the front room.
8573480	8577440	So usually if I'm out there and he's playing something, it's just me watching him play
8577440	8578440	something.
8578440	8579980	Especially now since I had my hand surgery.
8579980	8583520	You know, I really get a lot of enjoyment out of just sitting down watching him play.
8583520	8588760	Like I could sit and watch him play Grand Theft Horse for a while because it was very
8588760	8589760	cinematic.
8589760	8591800	Isn't watching games boring?
8591800	8592800	No.
8592800	8593800	No.
8593800	8594800	It's like watching a movie.
8594800	8598840	Actually, I have a DVD that's all the cut scenes of Final Fantasy X-2.
8598840	8601600	Alan will watch me PVP and wow and he enjoys it.
8601600	8604560	Of course, he likes to play backseat driver too, but that's okay.
8604560	8605560	It's fun.
8605560	8606560	I like doing that.
8606560	8607560	It's cool.
8607560	8614080	Alright, um, Dark Sakura, one more story and then I've got one more story as well and then
8614080	8617840	we're going to get to the phones, 877 game OLR in just a moment.
8617840	8621120	It's kind of funny because this is something I downloaded and never got a chance to play.
8621120	8623360	I was actually sitting here trying to play it.
8623360	8629040	Um, it was the Gorillaz Escape to Plastic Beach, which is on iPad and iPhone.
8629040	8630040	Oh, nice.
8630040	8631040	And, uh.
8631040	8632040	Good band.
8632040	8633040	What's that about?
8633040	8639640	Well, it's basically, it's them trying to get to the Plastic Beach and, like, you either
8639640	8647120	play, you play Murdock who flies on a Doom Glider and, um, he's trying to keep 2D from
8647120	8648120	escaping.
8648120	8649120	Nice.
8649120	8657480	You know, so it's, uh, it's only $1.99 and, um, you can get it as a browser game too.
8657480	8659640	So, uh, it's pretty cute.
8659640	8661520	Like, here, let me, let me start it up again.
8661520	8666600	I know this is fantastic cause you won't probably be able to hear it very well, but, um.
8666600	8667840	It seems interesting to me though.
8667840	8671980	I mean, usually these are the type of things you put out before an album comes out to kind
8671980	8674060	of raise awareness about it.
8674060	8676680	So it's a little weird that this is coming out now.
8676680	8680360	Is this picking up?
8680360	8681360	Very quietly.
8681360	8684080	Most of our listeners probably won't be able to hear it very well.
8684080	8688200	Headphone people will probably be able to hear it okay, but speaker people probably
8688200	8689200	not.
8689200	8690200	Yeah.
8690200	8693440	I'm trying to let you hear the beginning of it.
8693440	8694440	It's loading.
8694440	8695440	It's just beep, beep, boops.
8695440	8697440	Oh, we can hear it there a little bit.
8697440	8701440	I need to get away.
8701440	8704440	Oh, I'm so British.
8704440	8708760	He's left a key in your car.
8708760	8710760	Catch me if you can.
8710760	8715720	Oh, are you running a Monty Python skit on your iPhone?
8715720	8718760	That's what it sounds like a little bit, doesn't it?
8718760	8719760	So cute.
8719760	8723600	It is actually the actual voice actors and everything.
8723600	8724600	Nice.
8724600	8726600	Making more money off the characters, but hey, you know what?
8726600	8730680	If they can have Britney Spears apps and sing along to Lady Tap Tap Bieber or whatever those
8730680	8731680	games are.
8731680	8734280	She's such a cute little girl.
8734280	8735280	Who?
8735280	8736280	Justine Bieber.
8736280	8737280	That's awesome.
8737280	8741360	I was like, who are you talking about?
8741360	8742360	Britney Spears?
8742360	8743360	She's not a little girl anymore.
8743360	8744360	No, Justine Bieber.
8744360	8745360	Oh, Justine Bieber.
8745360	8746360	Okay.
8746360	8748360	She's the cutest little lesbian, I swear.
8748360	8754360	I'm a big Gorillaz fan, so this is so cute, but man, though looking at the iPad version
8754360	8757400	though, I'd really love to play the iPad one.
8757400	8758400	It looks like fun.
8758400	8761440	It looks very much like a Murdoch is Doom Glider.
8761440	8765840	One more story for you guys about a guy who now will have plenty of money to develop games
8765840	8766840	on the iPad.
8766840	8771720	If he chooses to Richard Garriott, he is the guy that made Ultima many, many years
8771720	8772720	ago.
8772720	8773720	Remember Ultima?
8773720	8774720	It was epic epicness.
8774720	8775720	It was an awesome, awesome.
8775720	8777880	I know I spent a lot of time playing Ultima Exodus.
8777880	8783320	He made a game a little less successful called Tabula Rasa a couple of years ago.
8783320	8784320	Remember that?
8784320	8791320	Well, Tabula Rasa closed of course, and NCsoft was the company behind Tabula Rasa and Richard
8791320	8794560	Garriott was not happy with the way things went.
8794560	8802240	In fact, he sued NCsoft for fraud, breach of contract, misrepresentation because he's
8802240	8806400	saying he didn't voluntarily leave the company as NCsoft claimed.
8806400	8807400	Ooh.
8807400	8808400	Well, here's the deal.
8808400	8812400	Apparently, it came out today that out of the 47 million that Richard Garriott was
8812400	8816240	seeking, he was actually awarded $28 million.
8816240	8817240	Touching.
8817240	8818240	Yikes.
8818240	8819480	So, there you go.
8819480	8822960	Apparently, they did find that there was some misrepresentation going on there and some
8822960	8827640	contracts were breached and so forth.
8827640	8828680	Very unfortunate.
8828680	8829680	You know what's unfortunate?
8829680	8833000	That was that NCsoft makes a lot of... I hope they have good insurance, like legal
8833000	8839000	insurance or something because they make a lot of MMOs and hopefully this won't hit them
8839000	8843560	in the pockets really hard because they've got a lot of stuff under development at NCsoft
8843560	8844560	right now.
8844560	8847280	This is going to suck that they're going to have to pay this guy out $28 million because
8847280	8853160	they screwed up some things.
8853160	8854960	Tabula Rasa was an interesting game.
8854960	8856040	It's kind of a bummer.
8856040	8857320	It got kind of a crappy break.
8857320	8858320	I don't know.
8858320	8860640	It shouldn't... Maybe they just didn't promote it well enough.
8860640	8861640	I don't know.
8861640	8863960	Nothing was able to beat WoW at that time.
8863960	8864960	I don't know.
8864960	8866600	But, there it is.
8866600	8867600	All right.
8867600	8872800	We are going to go ahead and open up the Skype line if you want to give us a call at 1-877-GAME-OLR
8872800	8875720	or our username on Skype is ORANGELOUNGERADIO.
8875720	8879680	Go ahead and give us a call and we'll take a few calls before we end the show, close
8879680	8885080	up shop tonight, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username is ORANGELOUNGERADIO.
8885080	8890880	I was hoping Loki would call us but I guess his Wi-Fi at the hospital is not so great.
8890880	8894160	He's not getting the private messages but that's okay.
8894160	8896640	He's got better things to do than talk to us, honestly.
8896640	8900360	I know we're his friends and everything but he's got more important stuff tonight.
8900360	8901560	It's all good.
8901560	8904360	It's all good.
8904360	8907360	We should try to take the mics on the road and go see the baby.
8907360	8908360	That would be fun.
8908360	8909360	That would be absolutely cute.
8909360	8913000	At the same time, everybody probably wants to be left the fuck alone right now.
8913000	8918320	Keep in mind, for the next month, all this baby is going to be able to see is blur, blur,
8918320	8919320	blur.
8919320	8920480	Ooh, red.
8920480	8921480	But you like blur.
8921480	8922480	They're a great band.
8922480	8923480	Yeah.
8923480	8924480	Dork.
8924480	8925480	We got a phone call.
8925480	8926480	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8926480	8927480	Who's this?
8927480	8929760	Hey, it's Rama back from Otacon 2010.
8929760	8930760	Hey, Rama.
8930760	8931760	What's up?
8931760	8932760	Sup.
8932760	8933760	How you doing?
8933760	8934760	Hey.
8934760	8935760	I'm doing good.
8935760	8938960	I'm a little tired but, eh, it's a con.
8938960	8939960	What do you expect?
8939960	8942480	You didn't get confunk, did you?
8942480	8943480	Cons are always exhausting.
8943480	8944480	No, wait, wait.
8944480	8947920	Just so you know, the term confunk is officially dead.
8947920	8950520	It's been replaced with hobo.
8950520	8951520	What?
8951520	8952520	What?
8952520	8953520	Okay.
8953520	8955520	Haven't heard that before.
8955520	8956520	Hobo.
8956520	8958400	Horrific otaku body odor.
8958400	8959400	Hobo.
8959400	8960400	Oh, god.
8960400	8961400	No, no, no, no, no, no.
8961400	8962680	A similar thing happens at game conventions, too.
8962680	8963680	No, no, no.
8963680	8968280	Confunk, but keep in mind, confunk also, though, encompasses con disease.
8968280	8969280	Ooh.
8969280	8970280	Well, that's just...
8970280	8971280	Well, that's...
8971280	8972280	Which was coined here in California...
8972280	8973280	Well, that's just...
8973280	8974280	Which was coined here in California...
8974280	8975280	...to replace the con in your pocket.
8975280	8978400	...to replace the con in California as the Dorbola.
8978400	8981640	Because remember, we can track it back to Doreen.
8981640	8982640	I remember that, yes.
8982640	8983640	Anyway...
8983640	8984640	We got married!
8984640	8985640	I know, I know.
8985640	8986640	She and Simon got married.
8986640	8988720	How was the con, Rama?
8988720	8993480	It was good, despite some of the couple of things that happened this weekend.
8993480	8998480	I had fun, my staff had fun, and I saw an ITG3 machine there.
8998480	8999480	What?
8999480	9000480	Wait, wait, wait.
9000480	9001880	They made an in-the-groove 3?
9001880	9002880	What?
9002880	9004100	There was an in-the-groove 3 machine there.
9004100	9007920	It wasn't on, so I don't know what was on it.
9007920	9010800	My game reporter, I'll have to ask her what was on the machine.
9010800	9013760	Didn't they get, like, sued to all hell?
9013760	9015840	And they can't make any more?
9015840	9018720	Was there a third mix officially?
9018720	9019840	I don't know.
9019840	9024640	I think it was in process before it got shut down, so, you know, maybe someone snuck it
9024640	9026360	out and threw it onto a machine or something.
9026360	9029040	I do have a picture of the unit, though.
9029040	9030840	A purposefully leaked prototype.
9030840	9031840	You said unit.
9031840	9035560	His son in chat says ITG3 is a mod of ITG2.
9035560	9037280	That wouldn't surprise me either, actually.
9037280	9038280	That makes sense.
9038280	9040880	Yeah, and oddly enough, there was no DDR machines there.
9040880	9045720	It was just that one ITG machine and two pump-it-up Pro2 machines.
9045720	9046720	Interesting.
9046720	9048720	Yeah, very.
9048720	9050200	What else in the gaming world?
9050200	9055280	Well, I didn't cover too much of the gaming because I was more covering it than I could
9055280	9057820	tell you about gaming cosplays.
9057820	9059440	I can tell you this much.
9059440	9065280	Every year when a Final Fantasy game comes out, everybody and their mother does cosplays,
9065280	9069880	and for the longest time, the big cosplay was always Final Fantasy VII.
9069880	9070880	I can tell you this right now.
9070880	9078520	There was about 12 to 13 Final Fantasy cosplayers, 6 to 7 of them were from XIII.
9078520	9079520	Wow.
9079520	9083220	Well, XIII's very cosplayable.
9083220	9084220	You know what I mean?
9084220	9087440	It is, but I don't think it really went over well with a lot of the fans, because from
9087440	9091480	when I talk to a lot of people, at first they love XIII, they're like, what the shit is
9091480	9092480	this?
9092480	9093480	Eh.
9093480	9094480	Hmm.
9094480	9095480	Eh.
9095480	9100120	I don't know, I still like XIII, I don't know what y'all's problem is, but whatever.
9100120	9103160	I enjoy XIII too, you know.
9103160	9105600	The battle system just kinda threw me.
9105600	9107440	That's probably what it is.
9107440	9108440	Gotcha.
9108440	9110960	Someone was supposed to lend me their copy.
9110960	9113360	I keep forgetting, I'm sorry.
9113360	9117600	You have to text me right before a show one night when I'm not in the bay.
9117600	9121120	Let's see, what else do I want to ask you about the con?
9121120	9125640	Well quickly, any really cool events, even anime style or whatever, what were some memorable
9125640	9127360	moments of the con?
9127360	9134640	Okay, my best memorable moment was the concert I went to this afternoon.
9134640	9139020	It was a Japanese hip-hop group called Homemade Kazoku.
9139020	9144600	The best way I could describe them is, if you remember hip-hop rap music from the 80s
9144600	9149880	when it was good, that'd take it to the next level.
9149880	9150880	I see.
9150880	9151880	Okay.
9151880	9153960	Are they as good as Dragon Ash?
9153960	9156960	Honestly, I think they're better than Dragon Ash.
9156960	9157960	Really?
9157960	9158960	Oh, snap.
9158960	9162440	And generally when a lot of Japanese artists come over, you know, they always have a little
9162440	9170840	bit of trouble speaking English to the fans, they were speaking in pure, 100% English.
9170840	9175720	No stuttering, no rough edges, it was just straight, clearly right across the board.
9175720	9182640	I've been to a lot of J-Rock, J-Pop concerts at Otakano, the conventions.
9182640	9186200	At this concert, everybody was on their feet going nuts.
9186200	9190120	I've never seen a crowd this wild.
9190120	9191120	Awesome.
9191120	9194200	Well, Rama, we got to wrap up so we can get more calls.
9194200	9196720	Do you have anything else you want to say about the con?
9196720	9199560	There was a fire at the convention center.
9199560	9200560	What?
9200560	9201560	Yes.
9201560	9203560	Did somebody say fire?
9203560	9205560	Oh, no.
9205560	9224240	So what'd you set on fire, Rama?
9224240	9225240	Rob?
9225240	9226240	What?
9226240	9227240	You're a dick.
9227240	9228240	You know what?
9228240	9229240	I know.
9229240	9238000	Okay, like, not everybody gets that joke, Rama.
9238000	9240840	All right, well, tell us about the fire real quick.
9240840	9246160	I was over in the Hilton doing a press conference with H&E Hotel, a Japanese fashion designer.
9246160	9251380	I found out from my staffers that a grease fire broke out in the concession stand, which
9251380	9256720	is downstairs, where the dealer's room is, they had to evacuate the entire convention
9256720	9257720	center.
9257720	9258720	What a con-runner.
9258720	9263200	At least it wasn't snowing outside.
9263200	9267520	And talking to some people, I kind of figured out who started the grease fire, and I think
9267520	9272920	only me and Jamie will catch this joke as I post a link to the complex in the chat room.
9272920	9273920	I did.
9273920	9274920	I did.
9274920	9275920	I did.
9275920	9276920	I like what Amaze Satsuma says in our chat room.
9276920	9277920	Con's on fire.
9277920	9278920	Nice.
9278920	9279920	I like that.
9279920	9284120	I can be the theme song for when your con gets set on fire.
9284120	9285480	All right.
9285480	9286480	That's it.
9286480	9289200	We're going to bring up on you now so we can take more calls, but have a good night.
9289200	9290200	Good night.
9290200	9291200	Bye.
9291200	9292200	All right.
9292200	9293200	Dude, fuck GameStop.
9293200	9296520	We're going to take another call real quick, and then I want to know more about why you're
9296520	9297520	angry.
9297520	9298520	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9298520	9299520	Who's this?
9299520	9300520	This is Kane IM.
9300520	9301520	I'm sorry, what was that?
9301520	9302520	It's Kane IM.
9302520	9303520	This is Kane IM.
9303520	9304520	Kane IM.
9304520	9305520	You're a female.
9305520	9306520	I got it.
9306520	9307520	What's up, Kane IM?
9307520	9308520	Not much.
9308520	9318600	Actually, I did find a way to run the live show off my phone, so I do appreciate your
9318600	9319600	guys' help.
9319600	9322120	Oh, he's the same guy who emailed in about getting the...
9322120	9323120	Yeah.
9323120	9324120	Okay.
9324120	9325120	What did you end up using?
9325120	9328520	It was a shoutcast program.
9328520	9333720	I did a little bit of searching online.
9333720	9334720	I'm glad you were able to find something.
9334720	9342440	I wanted to know if you guys had any suggestions on how to get an IRC program for my phone.
9342440	9344560	An IRC program for your phone.
9344560	9348000	So that I could join in on the chat.
9348000	9350440	I know that there is one for iPhone.
9350440	9351600	I don't know about the joint.
9351600	9355860	I hate to say iPhone again, but again, that All Games app, whenever it comes back, because
9355860	9358360	I imagine its disappearance is only temporary, you can get an IRC.
9358360	9359680	The joint has a browser, right?
9359680	9360680	Do you have a PSP?
9360680	9361680	Yes.
9361680	9362680	Okay.
9362680	9363680	If you have a PSP...
9363680	9364680	Yeah.
9364680	9369400	If you have a PSP.com, then you can do the chat and the stream all from the PSP.
9369400	9370400	Oh, no, wait.
9370400	9374720	Unfortunately, I'm a truck driver, and Wi-Fi is kind of scarce.
9374720	9375720	Oh, and you know what?
9375720	9378840	I lied anyway, because the chat room on the PSP is totally separate.
9378840	9379840	It's a junk.
9379840	9381280	It's all filled with spammers, too.
9381280	9382280	It's junk.
9382280	9384280	It used to be awesome.
9384280	9385280	Oh, hard.
9385280	9391920	Gosh, I'm trying to think of IRC that you could do on a Black Bear, or no, you have
9391920	9392920	an M-Droid, right?
9392920	9393920	Yes.
9393920	9394920	Yeah.
9394920	9398080	I'm not sure.
9398080	9401920	I'm opening up to our own chatters right now to see if they have any suggestions at
9401920	9404560	chat.orangelandraday.com.
9404560	9410920	I guess just try to search for something IRC, because with any IRC client, you should be
9410920	9415900	able to connect to the Game Surge Network, which is the network we're on, and then it's
9415900	9418520	just channel Orange Lounge.
9418520	9421440	Any IRC client can get to our room.
9421440	9423960	We use, here in studio, we use M-I-R-C.
9423960	9428040	So yeah, and this toy guy in our chat says, IRC is IRC is IRC, right?
9428040	9429040	And yes, that's correct.
9429040	9430040	Yeah.
9430040	9434880	So unfortunately, I don't know what IRC clients exist on that platform, but you have to run
9434880	9437640	a search and maybe Google can tell you.
9437640	9439120	All right, thanks.
9439120	9443480	All right, well, good luck to you, and well, hey, any games that you've been playing while
9443480	9446480	you've been out on the road?
9446480	9452120	I just got Naughty Bear, and my one sinful pleasure is Harvest Moon.
9452120	9453120	How do you like Naughty Bear?
9453120	9454680	Because I really want to play it.
9454680	9458280	I would picture manhunt with teddy bears.
9458280	9460220	That's about all it is.
9460220	9461220	Now see, it's-
9461220	9462220	It's good for a giggle.
9462220	9463220	Here's the thing, though.
9463220	9466600	It sounds awesome, and I remember when we were looking at the previews here in studio,
9466600	9471400	we were so excited and everything else, but I've heard the game is real shit.
9471400	9476180	Like it's getting terrible reviews, so I'm kind of, you know, not the reviewers necessarily
9476180	9479440	know everything, but it did kind of give me pause.
9479440	9483760	I was like, wow, this game is doing really bad in the reviews.
9483760	9484760	Can you see that?
9484760	9485760	Why that's happening?
9485760	9487160	Or do you think it's totally unfounded?
9487160	9494400	The controls are a bit clunky, the camera doesn't seem to want to want to cooperate
9494400	9495400	with you.
9495400	9502360	I mean, I would wait if you really want to play it until either someone else plays it,
9502360	9505120	or we play it bargain based.
9505120	9507720	I can, maybe I'll do that bargain basement then.
9507720	9510680	All right, it's too bad they can't get some of those basic things right.
9510680	9512360	It's like they don't even play the game or something.
9512360	9513360	I don't know.
9513360	9516000	Well then, in about, you know, a couple of months I might just pick it up.
9516000	9518840	Oh yeah, I thought you were an Xbox owner.
9518840	9520000	It's only on 3-
9520000	9523720	That doesn't mean I can't go over to somebody's house and play.
9523720	9525520	That's usually where I get all my gaming experiences.
9525520	9529960	I usually have some- I know a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy who owns a 360.
9529960	9530960	There you go.
9530960	9531960	There you go.
9531960	9535520	All right, well K9M, we're going to let you get back to your thing, but thanks so much
9535520	9536520	for the call.
9536520	9538040	And good luck with the mobile phone quest.
9538040	9539040	We appreciate you trying so hard.
9539040	9540040	All right, no problem.
9540040	9544240	You guys try and keep, you know, doing what you're doing and take it easy.
9544240	9545320	Well thank you very much.
9545320	9546320	Keep on trucking.
9546320	9547320	All right.
9547320	9548320	Bye.
9548320	9549800	I've always wanted to say that to a truck driver.
9549800	9550800	All right.
9550800	9556180	All right, anyhow, let's see, I'm looking at chat and some folks clarifying some things
9556180	9561800	about the OLR PSP and Hitstun is saying, OLR PSP's chat is a shout box, not an IRC chat.
9561800	9562800	And that is correct.
9562800	9565920	There is no IRC clients that work on PSP right now.
9565920	9570020	Loki tried to get that to happen and he couldn't, because you're absolutely right.
9570020	9571560	There's nothing that works right now.
9571560	9572560	So there it is.
9572560	9574240	Oh, we can do at least one more call.
9574240	9575240	Hi, you're on Orange Orange Radio.
9575240	9576240	Who's this?
9576240	9577240	Yeah, hello there.
9577240	9578240	Yo, hello.
9578240	9579240	Hello.
9579240	9580240	How are you doing?
9580240	9581240	Who's this?
9581240	9583800	This is that one, Aki Ripper from Sweden.
9583800	9584800	Aki Ripper.
9584800	9586080	From PlayStarts F2.
9586080	9587080	From Sweden.
9587080	9588080	It's the other Swede.
9588080	9589560	It's another Battle of the Swedes night.
9589560	9590560	I love it.
9590560	9591560	We had our emailer.
9591560	9592560	Aki Ripper.
9592560	9595960	No, there's always room for at least two Swedish people.
9595960	9596960	You know what?
9596960	9600040	If a third Swedish person wanted to listen, I would welcome them too.
9600040	9601040	What is on your mind?
9601040	9602040	Well, I will...
9602040	9604360	And if there were four, we could make our own version of Abba.
9604360	9606600	All right, Aki Ripper, what's on your mind?
9606600	9607600	Yo.
9607600	9609600	What the funk.
9609600	9610800	Damn it.
9610800	9611800	What's on your mind?
9611800	9612800	Hello?
9612800	9613800	Yeah.
9613800	9614800	Hello?
9614800	9615800	What's on your mind?
9615800	9624240	Well, I ramble on the network one time and, well, Star Wars 2 could be wonderful if I could
9624240	9625240	play it.
9625240	9626240	Oh, no.
9626240	9627240	What's going on?
9627240	9628240	Did they lock Sweden out?
9628240	9629240	No, no.
9629240	9636560	The thing is that I can't play it due to the thing that Battle of the Swedes refused to
9636560	9642360	accept that I have tapped in my key in Battle of the Swedes and said it's listed.
9642360	9648200	But when I launch a game and say like, no, you do not have a stock FT associated with
9648200	9650600	your Battle of the account.
9650600	9658200	Like it's all listed there, but the game refuses to say no, yes, or something.
9658200	9660520	We have an angry, angry Swede on the show tonight.
9660520	9662600	You hear that anger in his voice.
9662600	9663600	I don't...
9663600	9672160	I'm quite pissed in that regard since, well, I, well, around, well, 900 Swedish crowns
9672160	9678280	and that, which is like, I'm going to be a rough, how much, by the way, is the collector's
9678280	9681440	edition in, anyway, it's the collector's edition.
9681440	9682440	$99.
9682440	9688680	How much, how much you pay it, pay it in, and they can do it out, but it's somewhere
9688680	9696840	around, well, somewhere around 90 bucks or even less.
9696840	9697840	Wow.
9697840	9701800	Well, here's, here's a suggestion, I don't even know if this works, you probably already
9701800	9702800	done this.
9702800	9706760	Have you logged onto the web portal, going onto battle.net on the web and making sure
9706760	9708760	that the game is associated there?
9708760	9712920	Yeah, well there, it's listed there.
9712920	9721760	And well, the thing is that, well, I've, and here's the other thing though, the, the work
9721760	9725040	around that I'm trying to do is, well, change password.
9725040	9732600	If it weren't for the following fact that I had forgotten my like hidden question, hidden,
9732600	9735120	that's my, that's my problem, that's my problem.
9735120	9744520	So and I've, and well, I've tried for, tried to, for, tried calling the, calling Blizzard
9744520	9748880	about it, but here's the other thing though, trying to call the Blizzard line around these
9748880	9751180	parts, around these seems quite hard.
9751180	9757600	And the irony is that I've managed to, managed to call the US one when I had problems with
9757600	9763680	the, you know, when I had problems with my, at the time when I was playing World of Warcraft
9763680	9767760	on US, on US servers, then I got straight along.
9767760	9772280	And now it's like, yeah, you're out of luck or something.
9772280	9773400	Oh, well anyway.
9773400	9776740	Has your WoW account been inactive for some time?
9776740	9785040	My WoW account, my, both of my WoW accounts have been inactive for like a one of a year.
9785040	9787360	Did you have an authenticator on that account?
9787360	9795240	No, I did not because I, because the authenticator, when I played the, the authenticator wasn't
9795240	9796240	released yet.
9796240	9801460	It is possible, and I don't know, but it's possible that your account got hacked because
9801460	9805800	I have heard of people that even though they had inactive Warcraft accounts, that some
9805800	9810400	people would go in there and like reactivate them to get access to the characters.
9810400	9812720	It's crazy, crazy stuff.
9812720	9816080	Just hypothesizing that that could be what's screwing with you over there.
9816080	9822480	So definitely, uh, you're going to have to keep on Blizzard and, and I guess, well, I
9822480	9829680	will have to call them or, or in something because, well, uh, but, but, but my, one of
9829680	9835960	the problems that I have also is that, well, if I remember right, to be able to identify,
9835960	9842880	well, I'm have to go find, the problem is also is that I need to find like a scanner
9842880	9853720	or a scanner because I need to scan in my passport or something, uh, to send a, well,
9853720	9860800	to a basic way, like maybe in a file and send it to them and say that, yes, this is me of
9860800	9861800	sorts.
9861800	9862800	What a pain.
9862800	9864880	Or are you just going to have to give them the angry Swede?
9864880	9867640	Sounds like this angry Swede is quite justified in his anger.
9867640	9868640	Yes.
9868640	9869640	I, I, I wish you the best.
9869640	9871360	I wish there was a magic wand.
9871360	9879440	In that regard, I am quite pissed and also because, well, and also because, well, uh,
9879440	9884240	Starcraft 2, and here's the other thing though, in a kind of way, I already know what happens
9884240	9890400	in, because also the thing is, so, uh, playing Starcraft, I wasn't that hyped for Starcraft
9890400	9896640	2 in a kind of way anyway, since, uh, the thing that I did is that since I got the collector's
9896640	9902540	edition, you have this like special DVD of sorts when you get all the, uh, the, uh, video
9902540	9906240	frequencies from the game and I'm like, yeah, let's watch this.
9906240	9909880	So yeah, you just got spoiled the whole game.
9909880	9919120	Well, here's the other thing though, uh, and even more fun is that, well, if I, and especially
9919120	9922560	actually in a kind of way, since I'm like one of those players that played through the
9922560	9931720	first Starcraft game, we're playing like code power overwhelming, yes, please.
9931720	9934080	Which was that, well, god mode activated.
9934080	9935280	Oh well.
9935280	9936280	Okay.
9936280	9937280	Ripper.
9937280	9939720	I wish I could fix it for you, but it sounds like you're just going to have to keep on
9939720	9942120	Blizzard customer support, but do let us know what happens.
9942120	9943120	Okay, buddy.
9943120	9945120	Yeah, well, I'll keep you updated.
9945120	9946120	All right.
9946120	9947120	I hope he can get to the zerging soon.
9947120	9948120	All right.
9948120	9949120	Hang in there.
9949120	9950120	Take care, buddy.
9950120	9951120	Bye.
9951120	9952120	All right.
9952120	9953120	Poor guy.
9953120	9956040	But Hey, tough lesson for everybody learned.
9956040	9957040	Learn it.
9957040	9958040	Okay.
9958040	9959040	Ripper's expense.
9959040	9960600	Learn at the expense of the Swedes.
9960600	9964800	Don't forget your security question because that sucks when that happens.
9964800	9969280	You got to be very careful with that stuff, so make sure you will be able to remember
9969280	9973320	it later on or else you're going to have all those problems that Aki Ripper was talking
9973320	9974320	about there.
9974320	9975320	All right.
9975320	9977840	Well, that is going to do it for Orange Laundria's phone calls tonight.
9977840	9979400	We're going to close up the Skypline.
9979400	9980400	I don't know.
9980400	9982600	Usually Loki is the collector of last minute stories.
9982600	9984760	I don't know if Dark Sakura pulled anything.
9984760	9985760	I did.
9985760	9986760	You did?
9986760	9988600	Well, Dark Sakura, what do you have for last minute stories tonight?
9988600	9994960	The Canadians are luring game developers out of Alabama.
9994960	9999360	I didn't realize there was like this whole avalanche of game developers in Alabama in
9999360	10000360	the first place.
10000360	10008040	Well, the province of Newfoundland and Labrador paid $300,000 to a Huntsville, Alabama video
10008040	10012600	game development company so it could set up a studio in Canada.
10012600	10020480	It's Bit Trap Studios Canada is doing a multiplayer online games and wants some help.
10020480	10021480	I see.
10021480	10025920	They're hoping that it will infuse $1.6 million into the local economy.
10025920	10026920	I see.
10026920	10029520	I knew those Canadians were up to no good.
10029520	10031920	It's an economic war that they're declaring.
10031920	10032920	I see.
10032920	10038280	But that was like jazz.
10038280	10041240	Time to start pouring your maple syrup down the sewers.
10041240	10044720	Like, dude, I'm from Alabama, so it was cool.
10044720	10047800	I'm just, obviously I'm teasing, come on.
10047800	10049760	We like our neighbors to the north really.
10049760	10050760	Usually.
10050760	10051760	Usually.
10051760	10052760	Most days.
10052760	10053760	Most days.
10053760	10054760	All right.
10054760	10055760	Anything else?
10055760	10056760	Was that it?
10056760	10057760	Nope.
10057760	10058760	All right.
10058760	10059760	No, that was not it or no, there's nothing else?
10059760	10060760	No, there's nothing else.
10060760	10061760	All right.
10061760	10062760	I'm being a jerk.
10062760	10063760	All right.
10063760	10064760	That's going to do it for Orange Laundry tonight.
10064760	10068640	It's about time for us to go around and wrap everything up and put the nail in the coffin
10068640	10069640	of the show.
10069640	10072560	We're going to go around and get everybody's final thought, but first I have to thank our
10072560	10075320	guests for being here tonight because they did great work.
10075320	10076960	Really did good work tonight.
10076960	10077960	Really appreciate it.
10077960	10079200	So, Gary, thank you so much for being here tonight.
10079200	10080200	You're welcome.
10080200	10081200	It was a pleasure.
10081200	10082200	Glad to be here.
10082200	10084560	I hope the show has inspired you to get up in console and PC gaming.
10084560	10086360	I saw you were doing the Dungeons and Dragons download.
10086360	10089720	Yeah, but I'm also thinking about what console I should buy, so.
10089720	10090720	Oh, tough decision.
10090720	10091720	Tough decision.
10091720	10092720	Yes, it is.
10092720	10093720	Let me help you after the show.
10093720	10094720	All right.
10094720	10100080	So, do come back and let us know what you end up getting and what PC games you do end
10100080	10101080	up getting into.
10101080	10102080	Oh, I'd love to come back.
10102080	10103080	All right.
10103080	10104080	Please do.
10104080	10106080	Also, Myla, thank you so much for being on the show tonight.
10106080	10107080	No problem.
10107080	10108080	Appreciate it.
10108080	10112080	And a shout out to my lovelies in the chat rooms who actually know who I am.
10112080	10113080	We love the chatters.
10113080	10114080	Appreciate them.
10114080	10115080	So, yeah.
10115080	10116080	Go RuneScape.
10116080	10117080	Okay.
10117080	10118080	I'm done.
10118080	10119880	And Myla, keep enjoying your 12-year-old game.
10119880	10120880	I know.
10120880	10121880	It's great.
10121880	10122880	I know.
10122880	10123880	No, no.
10123880	10124880	No gaming reports.
10124880	10126880	So, between you and Drunami, I think we'll be pretty covered.
10126880	10127880	So, come on back sometime.
10127880	10128880	Yup.
10128880	10129880	Yup.
10129880	10130880	Yup.
10130880	10131880	With this economy, you need it.
10131880	10134680	DarkSakura, I'm going to ask for your final thought tonight.
10134680	10136680	What is your final thought?
10136680	10137680	Ow.
10137680	10139360	Poor thing.
10139360	10141200	DarkSakura deserves our full sympathy.
10141200	10142200	It's been a rough week.
10142200	10143200	Sympathy.
10143200	10144200	I want a cookie.
10144200	10145200	You need a hug.
10145200	10146200	And a cookie.
10146200	10147200	And a cookie.
10147200	10148200	And a pony.
10148200	10149200	And a dinner.
10149200	10150200	I need to give our guests their final thought, too.
10150200	10152200	Gary, do you have a final thought tonight?
10152200	10158600	Um, it's been too long since I've done any console game or any computer game and I need
10158600	10159600	back into it.
10159600	10164040	It looks like things have taken quantum leaps from the last time I did this seriously.
10164040	10167840	I saw the screenshots of Arkham Asylum and was blown away, so.
10167840	10169400	I'm glad we could inspire you.
10169400	10170400	Yup.
10170400	10172120	Uh, Myla, do you have a final thought tonight?
10172120	10173120	DC Online.
10173120	10174120	Wow.
10174120	10175120	Oh yeah.
10175120	10176880	You're totally going to be there, too.
10176880	10177880	Can't wait.
10177880	10182320	Uh, and my final thought is, I think Pinkberry would make it all better.
10182320	10183320	Yeah.
10183320	10184320	I've never been there.
10184320	10185320	It's really good.
10185320	10187200	But sadly, it's Sunday and they're not going to be open.
10187200	10188200	But anyway, tomorrow.
10188200	10189200	Aw.
10189200	10190200	Alright, that's it, guys.
10190200	10191200	Have a wonderful week.
10191200	10193040	We will be back here next week to do it all over again.
10193040	10195320	Unfortunately, Loki's going to be out for a little while longer.
10195320	10199560	But hey, DarkSakura and I are perfectly capable of holding down the fort, so tune in next
10199560	10202520	week to see what the antics bring and- I got duct tape.
10202520	10207400	We're going to have a co-host next week to fill in for Loki, so more on that next week.
10207400	10209640	We'll see you next week here at Orange Lounge Radio.
10209640	10211680	Oh, I almost forgot.
10211680	10214680	If you did enjoy our show, please tell two people about the show.
10214680	10218040	Help us spread the word because we're not a multi-million dollar organization.
10218040	10222000	You know, we're excited when we have $10 in the budget to spend on a Facebook ad.
10222000	10225160	So we really, really can use your guys' help in helping us spread the word of Orange Lounge
10225160	10226160	Radio.
10226160	10227160	That's all we ask.
10227160	10228160	Alright?
10228160	10229160	So we'll see you next week.
10229160	10230160	Have a great night.
