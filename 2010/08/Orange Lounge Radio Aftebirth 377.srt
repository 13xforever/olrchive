1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:24,440
Okay, guys, quick- shut up!

2
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,240
I didn't intend for that to happen, I swear.

3
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,240
Alright.

4
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,240
That was- I got bullshit!

5
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,240
Shut up.

6
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,240
That was too good.

7
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,200
Alright, we gotta save part B, and in order to do that I have to stop the recording for

8
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,920
a minute and play some music, so we'll be right back in two minutes with the afterbirth,

9
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,920
and yes, right, Dan, there's even more show to go.

10
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:40,920
Sweet.

11
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:41,920
Alright, we'll be right back, guys.

12
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:42,920
It's the sticky part.

13
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:43,920
Ew.

14
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,920
My thoughts exactly- we'll be right back!

15
00:00:49,920 --> 00:01:09,640
Okay.

16
00:02:39,640 --> 00:03:03,600
Hi, we're back with the Orange Laundry afterbirth.

17
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,360
It's the part of the show that's too hot to podcast, and I really apologize that we don't

18
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,160
have a webcam anymore.

19
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,720
You guys missed it during the break there.

20
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:17,880
Dan was doing the lasso, Mystique was trying to white people dance.

21
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:21,120
I was white people dancing.

22
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,120
And it was pretty scary.

23
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,120
You were trying to...

24
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,120
I did the sprinkler.

25
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,120
It was fun.

26
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,160
You were trying to glow stick rave without glow sticks with the lights on.

27
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,720
That was a very ravy song.

28
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,720
It was fun.

29
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,720
I should have...

30
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,720
And meanwhile, I'm over here sitting...

31
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,720
I don't know these people.

32
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,720
I don't know these people.

33
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,720
I don't know these people.

34
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,720
Send me some confused!

35
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,720
You were kind of wagging your finger a little bit.

36
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,720
That was...

37
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,720
I was trying to get more viruses off the computer.

38
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,720
Dan, where's my treble?

39
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,720
He's in the closet with Rob.

40
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,720
Rob is not in the closet.

41
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,720
True that.

42
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,720
All right.

43
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:59,920
Usually, we would do the cage match right about now, but we don't have a cage match

44
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,920
right now because Loki ain't here, so...

45
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,620
They wouldn't let me pick a song.

46
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,620
But we will...

47
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,620
No, we will.

48
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,620
And they banned my idea of a song.

49
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:09,120
I would have been afraid of what Dan would pick for a song.

50
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,720
But we will do some FUs.

51
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,120
Do we get sufficient chat remains?

52
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,120
Six.

53
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,120
I thought you said four.

54
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,120
Well, I've been nice.

55
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,620
I like even numbers, Rob.

56
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,620
You're never nice.

57
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,620
Play your music!

58
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:20,620
She's trying to confuse people.

59
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:31,620
The first one is Heihachi Tsundoshi, who's also...

60
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:37,620
Mike's out, FU to the mic.

61
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:45,220
Heihachi Tsundoshi, who's also Alpha Kinanagram, FU to Hatsune Miku, Project Diva, second

62
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:51,000
for not including the song Faraway by, is it Kizz or KZ, my favorite song from Diva

63
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,520
One, yet including the level stage elements in edit mode.

64
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,520
Maybe it's a special unlock.

65
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,920
Dan, have you ever played Project Diva?

66
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,320
I have no idea what you're talking about.

67
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,320
Miku.

68
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,720
I can't have the game I would play if I still had a PSP.

69
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,720
That makes me want to kill you.

70
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,360
Ranma, FU to my friend's husband.

71
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:17,520
Be thankful I didn't slap you out at Otacon last weekend, you ungrateful piece of trash.

72
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,000
Yeah, fuck that guy!

73
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,480
You should get on the knees and worship that woman because she does a lot more than you

74
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,480
think.

75
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:27,520
And also stop blowing your paycheck on frivolous shit and take care of your kids.

76
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,480
Dude, seriously.

77
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:38,360
GJBlazeKid, FU to Westroads Mall Arcade for fixing everything else but in the groove.

78
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,360
Toygak.

79
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,360
Can't fix a broken game.

80
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,360
I'm terrible.

81
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,520
FU to my computer for being the slowest piece of crap ever.

82
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,520
I will smash you to the ground if you don't shape up Toygak's computer.

83
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,840
Thanks for scaring my computer.

84
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,840
Yeah, fuck that computer!

85
00:05:53,840 --> 00:06:00,600
FU to you, you demanding wench, you heart.

86
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,360
Yeah, fuck that wench.

87
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:10,240
You know what, Patty, that was amazingly hot.

88
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,240
I can't stop thinking about you now.

89
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,080
I have no idea what happened.

90
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,160
Last one, MA says to my FU for getting jury duty.

91
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:23,600
At least I was able to request a postponement because of school is coming up.

92
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,600
Dan just got a look on his face like, oh fuck.

93
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,600
I think I had jury duty this week.

94
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,600
Fuck jury duty!

95
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,600
Fuck it right in the ear!

96
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,600
You do have jury duty?

97
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,600
Fuck it with something hard and sandpaper.

98
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,600
You do have jury duty?

99
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,600
I don't know.

100
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,600
You might want to find out.

101
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,600
You kind of like have to go.

102
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,600
Well I don't know.

103
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,600
Or you call them and tell them you have severe diarrhea and you can't do it.

104
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,600
I have to call in.

105
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,600
Tell them you have, tell them that you've died of dysentery.

106
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:52,600
Tell them you were in the fucking hospital last week.

107
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,600
Oh my god.

108
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,600
I can't believe we could have probably do it.

109
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,600
Oh it wasn't last week.

110
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,600
I think it's this week.

111
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,600
Like starting tomorrow.

112
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,600
Shit.

113
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,600
So you better call in.

114
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,600
Thanks for fucking with my wife.

115
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,600
Look at this.

116
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,600
Who's telling me what I already knew.

117
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,600
Fuck her!

118
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:08,600
I thought that was kind of the point.

119
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:12,600
That's what got you in trouble.

120
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:17,600
I like mustard on my French fries.

121
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,600
What the hell is happening to this person?

122
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:26,400
You know what the show needs more of?

123
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,400
Structure?

124
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:33,800
I swear to god if she put on that Vuvuzela thing I was gonna throw her phone in the toilet.

125
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,800
Me too.

126
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,800
What?

127
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,800
Nothing.

128
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,800
Why did I forget my favorite?

129
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,800
What are you talking about, the Vuvuzela?

130
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,800
I have no idea what you're talking about.

131
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,800
Don't do it.

132
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,800
I'll unplug your mic.

133
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,800
She's doing it.

134
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,800
What did you grab me for?

135
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,800
She wanted me.

136
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:55,200
Do you have any idea what's happening here?

137
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,880
For your information, Dan, four square, bitch.

138
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,880
Vuvuzela?

139
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,560
I forgot to check in because I want to become the mayor of the house.

140
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,960
You're never gonna be the mayor of the house, Rob.

141
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,960
I check in every day.

142
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,960
Yes, I'm the mayor of Walgreens.

143
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:11,520
We went right by the Walgreens near my house and I said, I should check in here.

144
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,840
Rob is the mayor.

145
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:19,000
Rob lives nowhere near the damn Walgreens by the house, yet Rob is the mayor of Walgreens.

146
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Don't feel bad.

147
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I'm the mayor.

148
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
How does this happen?

149
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Don't feel bad.

150
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I'm the mayor of the Walgreens across from my work.

151
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
And naturally my work.

152
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,560
I'm the mayor of a Chinese restaurant over by my house.

153
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,920
Aren't you the mayor of Kaushwitz?

154
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:33,000
I got dethroned as the mayor of Kaushwitz, which pissed me off.

155
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,100
Actually no, Melody was the mayor of Kaushwitz and I was the mayor of near the stinky cows

156
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,100
on I-5.

157
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,100
That's right.

158
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,100
That's right.

159
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,100
And let's see, what else am I the mayor of?

160
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,960
I'm the mayor of one other place and I can't remember what it is.

161
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,960
Walgreens.

162
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,960
No, it's not Walgreens.

163
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,680
I'm the mayor of Walgreens, the Chinese restaurant and one other place.

164
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,680
I can't remember.

165
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,680
Another Walgreens.

166
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,680
I was the...

167
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,680
Hold on.

168
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,680
Rob, you should create a...

169
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,680
I'm not the mayor of Taco Bell.

170
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:57,500
You should create a place that calls the chair in Jamie's house.

171
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,400
The chair at Jamie's house.

172
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,400
I will let you be the mayor of the chair.

173
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,520
Practically in the closet at Jamie's house.

174
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:08,260
In the closet at Jamie's house.

175
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,260
That's right.

176
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,260
The fabulous OLR Studios.

177
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:13,680
My grandma in our chat room says Rob is the fabulous mayor of Walgreens.

178
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,680
Fabulous.

179
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:18,520
Am I really that gay, you guys?

180
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,720
Come on.

181
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,560
You are wearing a shirt with a hot dog on it.

182
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,560
No, no, no.

183
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,680
It's not just a shirt with a hot dog on it.

184
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,920
It has a rainbow too.

185
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,920
It does.

186
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,920
It does.

187
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:32,280
You should take a picture of my shirt, but I just don't want my fat old gut to be out

188
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,280
there.

189
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,280
It just needs glitter to make it complete.

190
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,280
Hold on.

191
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,280
I'm trying to see where I'm the mayor.

192
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,280
I'm the mayor of three places.

193
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,280
Jack in the box.

194
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,280
Jack in the box.

195
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,280
Jack in the box.

196
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,280
Jack in the box.

197
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,280
Yes.

198
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:45,020
A week ago, Jack in the Box sent out the most amazing coupon sheet.

199
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:48,980
It had all sorts of cool freebies on it.

200
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,920
Rob totally made the peewee Herman face.

201
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,920
Okay.

202
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,920
Um, let's see.

203
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,920
Oh, I'm checking in.

204
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,920
Hold on.

205
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,920
Places.

206
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,360
And I gotta be careful how I do this.

207
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,440
I don't want to tell the listeners where you live.

208
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,640
This is so too hot for the podcast.

209
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,640
Exactly.

210
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,640
I know, right?

211
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,640
This is amazing radio right now.

212
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,640
Okay.

213
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,640
Oops.

214
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,640
As Rob plays with this iPhone.

215
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,640
Live!

216
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,640
On the air.

217
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,080
Amy is the mayor, let's see, check in here.

218
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,080
Fuck yes, I'm the mayor.

219
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,080
You're the mayor of where?

220
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,080
This house.

221
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,080
Really?

222
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,080
Yes.

223
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,460
That's just pathetic.

224
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:19,960
At least on Foursquare.

225
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:26,320
I just had to check to make sure my zipper was up when she took the...

226
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,880
All Games Radio is switching between its live and on-demand feed.

227
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,600
This may take several moments.

228
00:10:31,600 --> 00:11:00,640
All Games Radio is switching between its live and on-demand feed.

229
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,640
Tap dancing.

230
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,640
What happened?

231
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,640
I don't...

232
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,640
Be back.

233
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,640
All right.

234
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,640
Yeah, you've got hot dogs.

235
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:20,640
I have a pink roller skate on my shirt.

236
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:34,680
You do, we're free tonight.

237
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,680
I don't know how that happened.

238
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,680
I don't know how this stream came out.

239
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,680
Holly, you're tomorrow.

240
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,680
I didn't murder this stream.

241
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,680
Would you still remember me?

242
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,480
You know what we need to do?

243
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,400
You know what we need to do that we haven't done in forever and we'll do it tonight because

244
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,960
we don't have a cage match and we ended a little bit early tonight.

245
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,480
We're going to do Ask Orange Lounge.

246
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,480
Ooh!

247
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,480
Everyone.

248
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,480
Everyone.

249
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,480
Ooh.

250
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,480
Pretty good timing though.

251
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,480
Ah.

252
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,480
It is our master.

253
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,480
Ooh.

254
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,480
It decides who will go and who will stay.

255
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,480
You can ask us anything you want.

256
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,880
Within reason.

257
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,880
Ask Orange Lounge.

258
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,880
Type.

259
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,880
Message to Sky.

260
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,040
You can ask anything unreasonable, but we may not answer it.

261
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,040
That's right.

262
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,040
Ask.

263
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,400
Ask what color Misty's Undies are.

264
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,400
I'm going to do it.

265
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,400
She's wearing a ball.

266
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,400
I'm at Misty's to speak.

267
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,400
Because she'll tell you.

268
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,400
No.

269
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,400
I actually know.

270
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,400
All right.

271
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,400
Oh, really?

272
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,400
She's jacking.

273
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,400
I just slipped over.

274
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,400
Her panties were hanging out.

275
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,400
Hold on.

276
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,400
It was all for you, Rob.

277
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,400
I'm telling you.

278
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,400
Jamie's taking pictures.

279
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,400
What?

280
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,400
I can't even turn around.

281
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:49,720
Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.

282
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:54,360
All hell breaks loose.

283
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,360
I'm making shit happen.

284
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,320
I've got girls taking their pants off.

285
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,320
No, fuck it.

286
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,320
It's crazy.

287
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,320
Yeah.

288
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,320
Shit'd be crazy around here.

289
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,320
Dan, do it.

290
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,320
Rob.

291
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,320
It's not good.

292
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,320
It's fine as long as you don't see the cootie on there.

293
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,320
It's Misty.

294
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,320
It's Misty and Misty being on the cootie at the same time.

295
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:11,200
Do not put that on the Internet.

296
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,640
I would not put that on the Internet.

297
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,640
I'm putting it on the Internet.

298
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,640
I'm putting it on the Internet.

299
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,640
Dude, don't get our flicker taken away.

300
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,640
Look, stars.

301
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,640
It's just under us.

302
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,640
It's not like she's going beaver.

303
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,640
Now I want to watch Roger Rabbit.

304
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,640
Can we do...

305
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,640
Are you ready?

306
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,640
Ask O.L.R.

307
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,640
All right.

308
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,640
Ask O.L.R.

309
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,640
We got...

310
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,640
Look, every little red screen right there is a question.

311
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,640
So we got a lot of questions.

312
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,640
We want to see the picture of Misty's panties.

313
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,640
I'm seriously crying.

314
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,640
All right.

315
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:40,480
Ronma says, I demand a fucking web camera.

316
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,480
All right.

317
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,480
Can we go?

318
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,480
Can we go?

319
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,480
Yeah.

320
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,480
Top shit, Ronma.

321
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,480
All right.

322
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,480
Here we go.

323
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,480
Sing a song.

324
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,480
Can you help me out, Dan?

325
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,480
All right, guys.

326
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,480
I'm looking at the screen.

327
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,480
Let's ask O.L.R.

328
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,480
Some stupid question.

329
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,480
What will we find out tonight on O.L.R.

330
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,480
Radio?

331
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,760
Will we find out the color of Misty's panties?

332
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,760
Yes.

333
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,040
I deeply wish I had a lyric sheet because I want to sing that song.

334
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,040
I'm done.

335
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,040
O.L.R. radio song.

336
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,040
That's like if we're trying to sing about some chick's panties.

337
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,040
It is very fun.

338
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,040
I had a good time.

339
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,040
Exactly.

340
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:13,480
Singing the song with you.

341
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,800
The greatest thing is this part isn't recorded.

342
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,800
Oh.

343
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,800
Oh.

344
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,800
I want to listen to this again later.

345
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,120
Actually, I do have a recording running.

346
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:23,080
I usually just throw this out, but tonight I might save it.

347
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,160
You should save it for the DVD that we're never going to do.

348
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,520
The DVD we're never going to do.

349
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,960
We will do the DVD.

350
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,000
Free with every t-shirt.

351
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
We will do the DVD.

352
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
It's a DVD of a radio show.

353
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,560
If we ever get the damn shirts out.

354
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,560
It's just not what it's like.

355
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:39,360
Goldanthro asks, what color are Misty's underwear?

356
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,920
They are blue with stars on them.

357
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,080
Stars and moons.

358
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:48,760
But no pink diamonds or horseshoes.

359
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,760
Or Pikachu's.

360
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,880
DJ Blazkin asks, what was your first Bamani experience?

361
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,640
I'm going to defer this question to Dan.

362
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:59,120
What was your first Bamani experience?

363
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,000
Uh, I guess it would have been what?

364
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,400
Me bringing that burn over.

365
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,640
No, I mean, it was in the arcade for sure.

366
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,640
No, we had the-

367
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,200
Down in Milpitas.

368
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,200
That's, no, it was at Disneyland.

369
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,320
No, no, it was before that.

370
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,840
We played DDR in 99 when they were first coming out in California.

371
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,840
It was early.

372
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,640
I remember though, pretty early on, I imported the Dreamcast version for Jamie.

373
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:26,400
And that was probably the only version of DDR that I really bothered to play.

374
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,440
And then Julie bought a second dance pad, which I probably stole from her and never

375
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,440
gave back.

376
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,560
No, he's not kidding.

377
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,760
It's in the box.

378
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,920
We still have it in the box.

379
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:37,920
So yeah.

380
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,680
And if you ask her about it, she'll probably say, oh, I should get that back from you.

381
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:48,560
My first Bamani experience where I really enjoyed it was Guitar Freaks at Milpitas.

382
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,520
Which George got me to play because George was like, no, no, no, it's cool.

383
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,520
You'll like this.

384
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,000
And I was like, fuck that game.

385
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,120
I'm going to play Street Fighter.

386
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,800
And he was like, no, man, you got to try Guitar Freaks.

387
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,240
And I played Guitar Freaks.

388
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,960
And Guitar Freaks at first was the greatest Bamani game because you could suck at it,

389
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,760
but it didn't hack you too hard.

390
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,760
Like you could barely pass.

391
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,620
And it was like, that was the best song ever.

392
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:10,620
You kick ass.

393
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:11,620
And I'm like, I love this game.

394
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,520
It makes me feel good about myself.

395
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:17,080
Then like the third or fourth mix came out and it got blisteringly hard.

396
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,080
And I was like, all right, I can play Welcome to the Jungle.

397
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,080
And it's like, fuck you, you lose.

398
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:26,160
And I'm like, I paid for this.

399
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,520
That's what you pay Bamani games to do.

400
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,520
Make fun of you.

401
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,520
I hate that.

402
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,520
All right.

403
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:33,920
Rama asks, Sky, how fabulous are you?

404
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,920
Why?

405
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,920
I will, I will defer to the, to the others in studio.

406
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,080
How fabulous am I?

407
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:43,680
To quote Ulala in a paraphrase, you are fab-u-less.

408
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,560
Hot dog.

409
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,560
Misty?

410
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,560
Boom shakalaka.

411
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:53,320
I'm not quite sure, brilliant comes to mind though.

412
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,320
Jaguar!

413
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,320
Jaguar!

414
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,320
Jaguar!

415
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:05,080
SSJ wonder mat asks, how did Dan propose to Jamie?

416
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:08,080
Did you propose?

417
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,080
Even I know this story.

418
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,080
If you guys, if I know this story and you two don't.

419
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,280
We just more like decided that we were going to do it.

420
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,280
I think it had something to do with pro wrestling.

421
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,680
No, no, no, no, no.

422
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:19,080
We were watching, we were watching UHF.

423
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,240
Was it UHF?

424
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,240
On Valentine's day.

425
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,520
We were watching something and there was a lot of sex involved.

426
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,680
And Jamie got to drink from the fire hose.

427
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:28,680
Just so you know.

428
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,680
Yuck.

429
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:35,240
No, but we were drinking, we were, no, this is how you knew that one day your wife would

430
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,240
be Jewish.

431
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,240
Cause we were drinking Manischewitz.

432
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:40,960
I fucking didn't know you were going to be Jewish.

433
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,720
I still barely, I still barely, I still don't even want to realize that.

434
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,720
Mazel tov!

435
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,720
Mazel tov!

436
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:51,520
I'm going to get seven days of presents.

437
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,520
All right.

438
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,520
Yeah.

439
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,520
Pencils and erasers.

440
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,520
I love pencils and erasers.

441
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,520
Dan is a real humanitarian.

442
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,040
He tries to see the good in everything.

443
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,040
Yes.

444
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,040
My wife's going to be Jewish.

445
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,040
Eight days of presents!

446
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,040
Eight days of presents!

447
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,040
Yay!

448
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,040
Two Christmases!

449
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:15,040
I just, I just, just now see the irony in the present.

450
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:20,040
The proposed, the, the sort of co-decision to get married over Manischewitz.

451
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,040
All right.

452
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:25,040
Also, S2100Matt asks, when are you all coming to New York City?

453
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,640
New York City?

454
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,720
To get a rope.

455
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,320
When I ain't a broke ass.

456
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,720
When Sister Act is on Broadway.

457
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,720
Yeah.

458
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:37,520
I need to accumulate some money before I can come crush.

459
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,360
When someone invites me for free.

460
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,800
I've never been to New York.

461
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,800
I have.

462
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,800
It's fun.

463
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,800
It's, it's pretty fantastic.

464
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,800
I love New York.

465
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,800
Especially when I'm over that flank.

466
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,840
This is how long ago, this is how long ago was it?

467
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,840
I went to New York.

468
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:56,020
Um, there were still these really two large buildings and one of them had a hole in it.

469
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:59,520
There are so many ways to die in New York City.

470
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,520
Thank you, Dennis Leary.

471
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,520
All right.

472
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,520
But, Rob, does that date when I went?

473
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,520
Start spreading the news.

474
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,220
Well, I've already been to Chicago, so.

475
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,320
I love New York.

476
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,940
I have the best nights out in New York City.

477
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:13,940
You know why?

478
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:14,940
Because it's never end.

479
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:17,520
I want to go to New York with Rob.

480
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,720
We will have the best time.

481
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,720
We're going to go to Broadway.

482
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,720
Broadway.

483
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,720
Next question.

484
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:25,120
We're going to go see Mama Beyond Broadway, can't we?

485
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,120
Yeah.

486
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,720
We can make OLRG finally happen and it can happen in New York.

487
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,280
Giove Dea is asking quite a few questions here.

488
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,600
Some of them have already been asked.

489
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,880
Uh, we'll start here.

490
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,040
If you had Lady Tata's, what would their names be?

491
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,040
Ooh, Dan.

492
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:43,480
Hey, maybe, maybe that could be Lady Gaga's sidekick, Lady Tata.

493
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:46,840
Instead of Chibi Moon, it's-

494
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,280
Dr. Evil and Professor Chaos.

495
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:54,720
I think mine would have, well, on that note, then I would have to name one Alejandro and

496
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,760
the other one, I don't know.

497
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,760
Enrique.

498
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,760
Polka Face.

499
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,760
Ricky Martin.

500
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,760
Ricky Martin.

501
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,760
Yeah, Ricky Martin and Alejandro.

502
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,760
All right.

503
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,640
And Giove Dea wants to know, Rob, will you be my gay boyfriend?

504
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:11,600
Have you, have we ever played that song on the show before?

505
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,600
Do you have a lot of money?

506
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:18,600
Uh, when it comes to being, uh, uh, the, the hag gay relationship, I am Polly.

507
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,600
So I, yes.

508
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,600
Pollyanna?

509
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,600
And easy.

510
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,600
All right.

511
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:27,280
Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, your hags love you.

512
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,640
And I love my hags and they're fun bags.

513
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,640
All right.

514
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:35,560
Dark Tetsuya says, since there probably won't be a show, can we finally run the best of

515
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,060
next week?

516
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:40,720
If I'm not too lazy to upload it to the all game server?

517
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,720
Sure.

518
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:45,200
No, I'll just get, just get on me about that midweek and I'll make sure it happens.

519
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,920
Uh, Toa Gak asks, oh, a game question.

520
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,920
What is that?

521
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:49,920
A video game question?

522
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,920
I thought he was going to ask me what color undies I was wearing.

523
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,920
All right, here we go.

524
00:20:53,920 --> 00:21:01,840
Toa Gak asks, would you rather have a game with an amazing storyline, but last gen graphics

525
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:05,480
or amazing graphics and a poor storyline?

526
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:10,720
I would go with, with amazing storyline.

527
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,520
Like cease to mean anything after your first few hours of playing the game.

528
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:17,680
So the storyline is pretty much fine.

529
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,160
Are you comparing panties?

530
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,840
What is going on over there?

531
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:24,360
Take off your shirts.

532
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:29,440
Oh God, she did it.

533
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,320
Shit's getting crazy up in here.

534
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:36,000
Where's the malt liquor?

535
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,680
That's not my panties I was talking about.

536
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,280
By the way, very nice.

537
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,280
Malte liquor doesn't burn.

538
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,280
All right.

539
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:49,280
Um, I would say actually I want amazing graphics and poor storyline because you know, the spanking

540
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:53,040
game has no storyline whatsoever and that sounds better than anything else.

541
00:21:53,040 --> 00:22:00,000
So what's the nice question I'm getting to it.

542
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I'm getting to it.

543
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,440
Uh, Toa Gak also asked, why are there so many nicknames for boobs, boobs, knockers, tits,

544
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,440
fun bags, et cetera.

545
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,880
Um, jumblies.

546
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,280
Why not?

547
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:13,680
Well, how come so many-

548
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:17,040
Because breasts sound so formal.

549
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,800
People do stupid shit like name their car, so why not?

550
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:26,640
How come there's a song that talks about the many names of a penis?

551
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,640
Monty Python did it.

552
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,640
Halliwhacker.

553
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,680
Isn't it awful nice to have a penis?

554
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:34,200
Isn't it awfully good to have a dong?

555
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,920
Your piece of pork, your wife's best friend, your pussy or your cock.

556
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:40,200
You can wrap it up in riddance, you can stick it in your sock.

557
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:45,280
Amaze Satsuma says, can you give me a job slash occupation for Mad Libs?

558
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,280
Jizz Mopper.

559
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:51,640
Actually, actually I prefer Kumbucket.

560
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:55,960
Erotic Engineer.

561
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,920
I like Kumbucket.

562
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:02,280
Frisbee, dear strong bad, how do you type with boxing gloves on your hands?

563
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,480
Wrong show.

564
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:10,440
That question was totally crappy.

565
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,440
That's it.

566
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,440
That was all the questions.

567
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,440
I have a question, Rob.

568
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,440
What?

569
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,440
Uh oh.

570
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,440
What the fuck are we on?

571
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,280
I don't know, but that's going to do it for Ask Orange Lounge.

572
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,280
All games radio.

573
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,280
Who said we need to be on anything?

574
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,280
I'm not even on Bikin' It.

575
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:27,640
That's all the time we have for Ask Orange Lounge.

576
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,800
We hope you learn something tonight on Orange Lounge Radio.

577
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:35,160
All the women wear blue underwear.

578
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,160
That's all I learned.

579
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,920
And now I'm scarred for the rest of the night.

580
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:42,480
Good for you.

581
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,480
P.S. Jizz Mopper.

582
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,560
All right, Rama's asking a serious question.

583
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,960
Actually, this is a serious question.

584
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,960
Uh oh.

585
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,960
Downer.

586
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:52,960
All right, Rama say- Thanks, Rama.

587
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:53,960
Serious question.

588
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:54,960
We can't get a serious question.

589
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,960
I don't think I've ever told this on a show.

590
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:56,960
Are we really going to do this?

591
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:57,960
Sure, why not?

592
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:58,960
Do it.

593
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,760
Rama says, when did you come out of the closet and how did your family take it?

594
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:04,920
Dan, do you want to answer this?

595
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,920
They knew when I was young.

596
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:12,560
No, in Dan's case, when they finally removed the deadbolt and he came out blinking into

597
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:15,200
the sunlight for the first time in 13 years.

598
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,880
They were all surprisingly accepting.

599
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,880
Here's the deal.

600
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,880
Here's the deal.

601
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,040
My mom asked me for like three months straight every day, are you gay?

602
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,040
Are you gay?

603
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,040
Are you gay?

604
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,040
And like, it kind of got annoying.

605
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,280
Like I was like, cause this is what it was.

606
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:30,720
I didn't like the fact, you know, cause I had a tough time in high school cause I

607
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,480
got called fag and all that stuff a lot in high school and I didn't really like it.

608
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,080
And I didn't really know I was gay then cause I was just trying to be normal.

609
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,380
You know, have a girlfriend and you know, this is how we roll.

610
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:42,560
You know, I'm, I'm a hot stud playing the clarinet in the marching band, right?

611
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:47,840
So you know, and trying to do that whole thing, I didn't really want to admit I was gay because

612
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,000
I didn't want all those people to be right.

613
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,880
But then when I kind of realized I was gay, like I, that was one of the first things I

614
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,880
had to conquer.

615
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,880
So when my mom joined in on it, I really didn't appreciate it.

616
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:01,000
Probably one day it actually kind of exploded in a, yes, are you happy?

617
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Now leave me alone.

618
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,520
And she ran off to her room to cry for the rest of the day.

619
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,600
But here's why she did it.

620
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,120
I found this out years later.

621
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:11,800
I had some friends over one night and she actually overheard one of my lady friends

622
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:16,260
at the time, um, I almost said her name, but I guess I shouldn't, on the phone, uh, talking

623
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:20,080
to her mom and she overheard her say to her mom, no, don't worry.

624
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,080
They're all gay guys.

625
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,080
It's going to be fine.

626
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,760
So my mom actually found out because of my loud mouth female friend.

627
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,080
So she knew that whole time.

628
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,040
She just wanted me to tell her bitches.

629
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,040
All right.

630
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:35,520
But then the next day she came out with her eyes all puffy and you know, she's like, I

631
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,680
just want you to know I still love you.

632
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:40,360
And I've known since you were four.

633
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:44,120
And I'm like, how do you know when I didn't know until I was like 17, how do you know

634
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,520
when you're four?

635
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:51,040
Because mothers always, we had a kid in my family, you know, but my, my eldest cousin

636
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:57,600
who was gay and I never, you know, I never put two and two into it.

637
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:01,440
It was just, he was who he was, but my folks and people in my family were always like,

638
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,560
we knew from the time he was a young, young boy that he was gay.

639
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:08,580
I just, I always, there's a part of me that doesn't like that though, because it insinuates

640
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:10,600
that being gay, you act a certain way.

641
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:13,280
And I don't think that's true.

642
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:18,280
As I sit here on my legs crossed tapping on the table, but there's not like you can't,

643
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,280
okay.

644
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,440
You can't act gay if you're straight, you can't act straight if you're gay.

645
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:26,240
But what is straight acting and gay acting?

646
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,000
There's not, you know, you know what I'm talking about.

647
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,520
You fucking know what I'm talking about.

648
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:35,960
I do, but I understand I'm not trying to perpetuate the stereotype or anything, but like I looked

649
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:42,040
at Rob when I first met you and I was like, wow, and you're not wearing like feather boas

650
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,040
and shit.

651
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:59,200
I didn't come in and go, hi Dan, Dan's gaydar has improved because I wasn't threatening.

652
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,280
I was probably, I probably had my arm around Jamie and we were skipping and Dan was like,

653
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:09,840
somehow this is not threatening to me.

654
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:17,600
Dan knows that I have complete and utter devotion to the gays, the truth is, you know, I realize

655
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,480
that any who oppose me can be summarily dealt with.

656
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,960
All right.

657
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:28,320
Do you know if I told my mom about that I had a girlfriend before?

658
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,320
Really?

659
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,320
You know what she said?

660
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,320
What?

661
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,320
I don't need to hear that.

662
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,320
Yeah, me either.

663
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,320
You do?

664
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,320
All right.

665
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,800
Well, here's the, here's the other thing that's important because my mom said, and this is

666
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:41,880
very important, important part of the story is my mom said, I called your grandma and

667
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,240
I told her, I'm like, why are you telling everybody?

668
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,280
She's like, no, I want you to know what your grandma said, because it meant a lot.

669
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:50,080
I told your grandma that you were gay and I'm like, what'd she say?

670
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:55,120
And my grandma said, so what?

671
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,120
So rest in peace, grandma Shaw.

672
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,120
All right.

673
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:03,680
Uh, anyhow, um, Dan, I do miss your cousin because I got along really well with your

674
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,680
cousin.

675
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:13,280
Uh, lastly, God, it's like the all gay OLR DJ Blaiskin asks, what do you think about

676
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,440
prop eight being put in the fire?

677
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:20,680
Um, obviously, obviously it needed to happen and it's a good thing.

678
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:24,520
But the thing is, is that, you know, because of the way it happened, that there are people

679
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:27,240
out there who do still want to fight it.

680
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,240
It's not over.

681
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:32,320
I just, I would, there's a part of me that really hopes the stay gets lifted, but honestly

682
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,100
this issue just isn't over until the Supreme court decides on it.

683
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:39,000
And I am a little nervous about the Supreme court decides, are we going to take away next?

684
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:45,440
I just hope that history and things that happened in, you know, loving V Virginia and some of

685
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,480
these other things that happened in the past will kind of set the presidents for overturning

686
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,580
property at the Supreme court level.

687
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:56,540
But I worry there's unfortunately that many ignoramus people in the world who for whatever

688
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:58,440
reason want to have their say in my life.

689
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:02,280
The moment they bring the 14th amendment into it, you know, it becomes an even bigger issue.

690
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:07,720
And I kind of think that some of those pro prop eight people might actually have more

691
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:13,820
to fear if it goes to the, to the Supreme court, because then if, if this, they uphold

692
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:19,240
the ruling that, yes, this is unconstitutional, that's national precedent.

693
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,240
National precedent.

694
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,380
There's a bunch of scared ass insecure fuckers.

695
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:23,380
I know.

696
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:32,160
It's just like, what I assure you, I don't want to have my wedding in a church and I

697
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:37,480
am not going to sue any church that doesn't want to have my wedding because I'm not, well,

698
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,920
I just, people can do whatever they want to do.

699
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,240
No, here's what I have to do, whatever you want to do.

700
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,520
Let me do what I want to do here, Rob.

701
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,520
Here's what I have to say.

702
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,520
What is it?

703
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,520
Okay.

704
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:53,700
If you know, the, the fundamental Christians want to use Leviticus as their standing point

705
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:57,440
for saying, you know, which is actually in Jewish law, man shall not lay with another

706
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,700
man like a woman.

707
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:00,840
That just means that I guess you can't have boobs or something.

708
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:06,200
Um, but anyway, if, if the Christians want to use Leviticus, they also have to keep kosher

709
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:10,800
and grow out their beards and wear tall black hats like the Hasidic do.

710
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,760
I put the fun in fundamentalist.

711
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:17,600
Well it's not even, here's the thing, quote the Bible all you want or any religious text,

712
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:23,260
but there's like an amendment in the constitution that says freedom of religion, meaning I am

713
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,760
free of your religion.

714
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,840
Well see, and that's, that's my other point.

715
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:35,400
I mean, my point is that if they're trying to use, if they're trying to use a law when

716
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:42,760
they admittedly don't follow the laws themselves, then that's just being hypocritical.

717
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:43,760
Here's the end of the thing.

718
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:48,040
I am encouraged by the fact that folks our age, and I see a lot of people in chat going,

719
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,200
I have a gay friend who cares.

720
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,200
I don't care.

721
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:55,880
You know, and that, that seems to be the attitude of most 18 to 35 year olds in this day and

722
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:56,880
age.

723
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:57,880
They just need to vote.

724
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:02,640
So the good news is when we're the old farts on the Supreme Court making the decisions,

725
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,640
this will be over.

726
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,640
Yeah.

727
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,520
We're just going to have to wait for the ignorant people to pass on.

728
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:13,260
Well, I mean, if you, if you take a look at the civil rights movement, the 14th amendment

729
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:19,920
passed a hundred years before Brown versus the Board of Education and the, and the Montgomery

730
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:25,040
boycott, the Montgomery bus boycott with Rosa Parks.

731
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:29,680
And so how many of us our age look back on that and go, God, they were so dumb.

732
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,760
Like what was the big fucking deal?

733
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,760
Like when, right.

734
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,760
Yeah.

735
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:39,800
But when the Plessy case went, there's people who were old, old, you know, were young at

736
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:45,500
that time who disagreed, who were older at that time and voted in the new way.

737
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,080
That's you're exactly right.

738
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:50,160
Our history is teaching us right now that eventually all of those people with the big

739
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,160
stick up their ass are going to be dead.

740
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:56,280
And guess who gets to step in?

741
00:31:56,280 --> 00:32:01,760
So even if I'm not around to see it, I know someday it will change.

742
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,760
And that's that.

743
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:03,760
We'll be able to marry Pikachu.

744
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:07,560
But you know, if anyone is still listening, is anyone still listening?

745
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:10,400
Yeah, we actually have a few people still listening believe it or not.

746
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:13,900
I'm just saying if anyone is still listening, make sure that when the opportunity comes

747
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:18,000
up for you to vote and important issues like this, that you do it because I was watching

748
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,020
the voter turnout during the whole Prop 8 thing and I was completely dismayed.

749
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:26,400
They were, we were really relying on, you know, the Berkeley area and you know, the

750
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:31,760
voter turnout was only something like 52% and it could have completely turned the whole

751
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:36,120
thing because the vote was 52 to 49.

752
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:40,400
Just if the rest of the voting population had put in the effort, it wouldn't have even

753
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,400
been an issue.

754
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,400
So, I'm just saying.

755
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:47,360
This was a very interesting election year though, because either way the tide had gone,

756
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,480
you were going to have a minority in the White House.

757
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:53,080
Either you had a racial minority or you had the sexual minority.

758
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,940
You would have had one crazy ass fucking woman in the White House, but you would have had

759
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:57,880
a woman in the White House, you know?

760
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:03,080
You know what, you know what, I think my problem with Hillary is that she, uh,

761
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,080
No, I don't.

762
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,080
I'm not talking to her.

763
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,080
I'm talking Sarah Palin.

764
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:13,400
Hillary doesn't win the primaries, but despite whatever, whatever happened, you would have

765
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,080
had a minority in the White House when we were there.

766
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:23,240
I thought, I thought it was two minorities right there, two minorities in one, and that's

767
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,240
going to be the bill.

768
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,240
This is what we need.

769
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:29,360
What we need, Rob, is a Jewish black woman.

770
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:32,600
What we need is just someone who's not a dick.

771
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,480
Like that's just all I want.

772
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,680
And I, I'm not going to get too political.

773
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:43,560
That means I'll never be president, because I put the dick in the dictator.

774
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:46,480
No, I, I, we need Renna.

775
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,480
We need Renna.

776
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,480
President cat.

777
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,480
That's right.

778
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,480
That's what we need.

779
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,480
President cat.

780
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,480
You will meow this mess.

781
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,840
All right.

782
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,520
Should we declare nuclear war?

783
00:33:56,520 --> 00:34:01,080
Would you like to play a game?

784
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,040
Let's go to the fortune cookie message of the day.

785
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,120
This show is getting too deep.

786
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:07,480
I mean, this is just, this is supposed to be a haha funny show.

787
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,480
We sung the thing.

788
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,480
The segment's over.

789
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,480
Quit asking questions.

790
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:15,960
Yeah, but this is, this is erotic chat and gold shire.

791
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:16,960
Keep in mind.

792
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,520
This is what happens when geeks grow up.

793
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,520
Yep.

794
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,520
Guess what?

795
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:25,520
All you kids, you're going to read geek life, geek-life.com.

796
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,520
That guy from Sweden.

797
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,520
Here.

798
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,520
Here it is.

799
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:29,520
Your fortune.

800
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,520
I think he is our age.

801
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:36,880
Here's your fortune cookie message of the day kids.

802
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,500
That's a fucking leprechaun.

803
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,000
That's rock star shit.

804
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,280
The leprechaun is amazing.

805
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,960
I'll eat your dog and shine your shoes.

806
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,960
Fuck you.

807
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:46,960
I'm a leprechaun.

808
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:47,960
Magically delicious.

809
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,960
Yellow moons.

810
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,960
Pink hearts.

811
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:50,960
Fuck you.

812
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:51,960
I'll eat your dog and shine your shoes.

813
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,600
They'll eat your fucking dog.

814
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:57,960
They're not fucking around and they'll shine your shoes.

815
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,880
That's a complete 180.

816
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:02,480
I saw the movie leprechaun years back.

817
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,480
Awesome piece of film.

818
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,000
They eat your dog, but they'll shine your shoes.

819
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,600
One minute, the next minute.

820
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,600
You know what?

821
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:14,920
My dog's important to me because my dog licks, but a fucking leprechaun.

822
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:18,520
Whoever came up with that, by the way, fucking genius.

823
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,920
They are drunk.

824
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:20,920
They're mean.

825
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:21,920
They're green.

826
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,920
They got rotted teeth.

827
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:23,920
All they care about is money.

828
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,920
They're my agent.

829
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,520
I'll eat your dog and shine your shoes.

830
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,520
Fuck you.

831
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,520
I'm a spring.

832
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,480
They're wonderful little fucking creatures.

833
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:35,640
If you go outside when you leave here tonight, you fucking see a leprechaun.

834
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,640
You shoot that mother fucking thing.

835
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:38,640
You kill that dead.

836
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:39,640
You put that down.

837
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:43,040
That was Bob Saget, believe it or not.

838
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,040
That's crazy.

839
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,040
Isn't it?

840
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,040
Crazy.

841
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:48,160
Thank you guys so much for staying up late with us.

842
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,160
We really appreciate it.

843
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,160
I know I had fun tonight.

844
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,160
I hope you guys did too.

We'll see you back here in two weeks.

Dead Pixel Live.

850
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,440
No, we like them.

851
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,440
Derek's cool.

852
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,440
He put on the big battle.

853
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,440
He's a good guy.

854
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,440
Works hard.

855
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,600

Bye.
