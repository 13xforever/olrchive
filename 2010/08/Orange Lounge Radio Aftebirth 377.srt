1
00:00:19,707 --> 00:00:20,427
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, guys.

2
00:00:21,888 --> 00:00:22,468
[SPEAKER_01]: Shut up.

3
00:00:24,468 --> 00:00:26,129
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't intend for that to happen, I swear.

4
00:00:26,229 --> 00:00:26,469
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

5
00:00:26,589 --> 00:00:27,909
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a couple of shit.

6
00:00:28,069 --> 00:00:28,370
[SPEAKER_07]: Shut up.

7
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:29,130
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

8
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:30,550
[SPEAKER_07]: That was too good.

9
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:31,070
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

10
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:35,212
[SPEAKER_07]: We got to save part B. In order to do that, I have to stop the recording for a minute and play some music.

11
00:00:35,232 --> 00:00:37,292
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll be right back in two minutes with the afterbirth.

12
00:00:37,792 --> 00:00:39,613
[SPEAKER_07]: And yes, right, Dan, there's even more show to go.

13
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:40,553
[SPEAKER_07]: Sweet.

14
00:00:40,673 --> 00:00:40,873
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

15
00:00:40,893 --> 00:00:41,553
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll be right back, guys.

16
00:00:41,573 --> 00:00:42,414
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the sticky part.

17
00:00:42,554 --> 00:00:42,694
[SPEAKER_07]: Ew.

18
00:00:42,714 --> 00:00:44,394
[SPEAKER_07]: Ew.

19
00:00:47,652 --> 00:00:49,573
[SPEAKER_07]: My thoughts exactly We'll be right back

20
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,500
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, we're back with the Orange Launch Radio Afterbirth.

21
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:08,303
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the part of the show that's too hot to podcast, and I really apologize that we don't have a webcam anymore.

22
00:03:08,323 --> 00:03:08,884
[SPEAKER_07]: Way too hot.

23
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:10,845
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys missed it during the break there.

24
00:03:11,486 --> 00:03:12,947
[SPEAKER_07]: Dan was doing the lasso.

25
00:03:14,608 --> 00:03:16,390
[SPEAKER_07]: Mystique was trying to white people dance.

26
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,611
[SPEAKER_07]: I was white people dancing.

27
00:03:21,031 --> 00:03:21,952
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was pretty scary.

28
00:03:21,972 --> 00:03:23,932
[SPEAKER_03]: You were trying to... I did the sprinkler.

29
00:03:23,952 --> 00:03:24,272
[SPEAKER_03]: It was fun.

30
00:03:24,292 --> 00:03:26,733
[SPEAKER_03]: You were trying to glow stick rave without glow sticks.

31
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:26,953
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

32
00:03:27,273 --> 00:03:28,114
[SPEAKER_03]: And with the lights on.

33
00:03:28,134 --> 00:03:29,534
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a very rave-y song.

34
00:03:29,774 --> 00:03:30,654
[SPEAKER_07]: It was fun.

35
00:03:31,034 --> 00:03:33,095
[SPEAKER_03]: And meanwhile, I'm over here sitting... I don't know these people.

36
00:03:33,115 --> 00:03:33,775
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know these people.

37
00:03:33,935 --> 00:03:34,435
[SPEAKER_03]: All these people.

38
00:03:34,475 --> 00:03:35,716
[SPEAKER_07]: Somebody's confused!

39
00:03:35,956 --> 00:03:37,476
[SPEAKER_07]: You were kind of wagging your finger a little bit.

40
00:03:37,516 --> 00:03:40,377
[SPEAKER_07]: She was over there trying to get more viruses off her computer.

41
00:03:41,078 --> 00:03:41,438
[SPEAKER_03]: Dan!

42
00:03:43,638 --> 00:03:44,619
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's my treble?! !

43
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:47,871
[SPEAKER_06]: In the closet with Rob.

44
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:51,293
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob is not in the closet.

45
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:53,775
[SPEAKER_06]: So I ain't in the closet.

46
00:03:54,095 --> 00:03:54,555
[SPEAKER_07]: True that.

47
00:03:55,496 --> 00:03:55,856
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

48
00:03:56,036 --> 00:03:58,678
[SPEAKER_07]: Usually we would do the cage match right about now.

49
00:03:58,998 --> 00:04:01,019
[SPEAKER_07]: But we don't have a cage match right now because Loki ain't here.

50
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,641
[SPEAKER_06]: They wouldn't let me pick a song.

51
00:04:04,061 --> 00:04:04,381
[SPEAKER_07]: No, we will.

52
00:04:04,902 --> 00:04:06,323
[SPEAKER_04]: And they banned my idea of a song.

53
00:04:06,563 --> 00:04:08,404
[SPEAKER_07]: I would have been afraid of what Dan would pick for a song.

54
00:04:08,924 --> 00:04:10,645
[SPEAKER_07]: But we will do some FUs.

55
00:04:10,665 --> 00:04:11,886
[SPEAKER_07]: Did we get sufficient chat remains?

56
00:04:11,926 --> 00:04:12,307
[SPEAKER_03]: Six.

57
00:04:12,747 --> 00:04:13,487
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought you said four.

58
00:04:13,687 --> 00:04:14,528
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I've been nice.

59
00:04:15,008 --> 00:04:16,029
[SPEAKER_03]: I like even numbers, Rob.

60
00:04:17,506 --> 00:04:18,307
[SPEAKER_07]: You're never nice.

61
00:04:18,627 --> 00:04:20,009
[SPEAKER_04]: Play the music!

62
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:22,272
[SPEAKER_04]: She's trying to confuse people.

63
00:04:30,441 --> 00:04:35,608
[SPEAKER_07]: The first one is... Mike's out.

64
00:04:36,008 --> 00:04:36,429
[SPEAKER_07]: F you to the mic.

65
00:04:39,425 --> 00:04:54,897
[SPEAKER_03]: Heihachi Suendoshi, who's also Alpha Kananagram, F you to Hatsune Miku Project Diva 2nd for not including the song Far Away by KZ, my favorite song from Diva 1, yet including the level, stage, elements, and edit mode.

66
00:04:55,358 --> 00:04:56,639
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it's a special unlock.

67
00:04:57,119 --> 00:04:58,740
[SPEAKER_07]: Dan, have you ever played Project Diva?

68
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:01,322
[SPEAKER_07]: I have no idea what you're talking about.

69
00:05:01,362 --> 00:05:03,284
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a Hatsune Miku.

70
00:05:03,304 --> 00:05:04,865
[SPEAKER_04]: It can't be the game I'd play if I still had PSP.

71
00:05:04,885 --> 00:05:05,946
[SPEAKER_06]: That makes me want to kill you.

72
00:05:08,925 --> 00:05:11,306
[SPEAKER_03]: Ranma, F you to my friend's husband.

73
00:05:11,346 --> 00:05:15,749
[SPEAKER_03]: Be thankful I didn't slap you out at Otakon last weekend.

74
00:05:16,089 --> 00:05:17,310
[SPEAKER_03]: You ungrateful piece of trash.

75
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:18,770
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, fuck that guy.

76
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:22,813
[SPEAKER_03]: You should get on the knees and worship that woman because she does a lot more than you think.

77
00:05:23,193 --> 00:05:26,475
[SPEAKER_03]: And also stop blowing your paycheck on frivolous shit and take care of your kids.

78
00:05:26,895 --> 00:05:28,015
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, seriously.

79
00:05:30,417 --> 00:05:36,200
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Blaze Kid, F you to Westroads Mall Arcade for fixing everything else but in the groove.

80
00:05:37,753 --> 00:05:38,934
[SPEAKER_07]: Twigak.

81
00:05:38,954 --> 00:05:39,955
[SPEAKER_07]: Can't fix a broken game.

82
00:05:42,237 --> 00:05:42,757
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm terrible.

83
00:05:43,157 --> 00:05:45,519
[SPEAKER_03]: F you to my computer for being the slowest piece of crap ever.

84
00:05:45,619 --> 00:05:49,102
[SPEAKER_03]: I will smash you to the ground if you don't shape up Twigak's computer.

85
00:05:49,542 --> 00:05:50,623
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for scaring my computer.

86
00:05:50,643 --> 00:05:52,504
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, fuck that computer.

87
00:05:53,946 --> 00:05:54,486
[SPEAKER_03]: Jodea.

88
00:05:54,506 --> 00:05:59,270
[SPEAKER_03]: F you to you for demanding F you to you, you demanding wench, you heart.

89
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:01,391
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, fuck that wench.

90
00:06:03,293 --> 00:06:03,793
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

91
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:08,920
[SPEAKER_03]: Patty, that was amazingly hot.

92
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,620
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't stop thinking about you now.

93
00:06:12,741 --> 00:06:14,181
[SPEAKER_06]: I have no idea what happened.

94
00:06:15,841 --> 00:06:18,722
[SPEAKER_03]: Last one, Emei Satsuma, F you for getting jury duty.

95
00:06:19,142 --> 00:06:22,903
[SPEAKER_03]: At least I was able to request a postponement because of school is coming up.

96
00:06:23,543 --> 00:06:27,484
[SPEAKER_07]: Dan just got a look on his face like, oh, I think I got jury duty this week.

97
00:06:29,773 --> 00:06:30,534
[SPEAKER_05]: Jury duty.

98
00:06:31,014 --> 00:06:32,315
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck it right in the ear.

99
00:06:32,335 --> 00:06:33,215
[SPEAKER_05]: You do have jury duty?

100
00:06:33,235 --> 00:06:35,497
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck it with something hard and sandpaper.

101
00:06:36,697 --> 00:06:37,598
[SPEAKER_05]: You do have jury duty?

102
00:06:37,618 --> 00:06:38,278
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

103
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:40,540
[SPEAKER_07]: You might want to find out.

104
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,481
[SPEAKER_07]: You kind of like have to go.

105
00:06:42,982 --> 00:06:46,063
[SPEAKER_07]: Or you call them and tell them you have severe diarrhea and you can't do it.

106
00:06:46,164 --> 00:06:48,065
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to call in.

107
00:06:48,985 --> 00:06:50,286
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell them that you've died of dysentery.

108
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:53,628
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell them you were in the fucking hospital last week and they'll probably do it.

109
00:06:53,648 --> 00:06:54,429
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it wasn't last week.

110
00:06:54,469 --> 00:06:55,349
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's this week.

111
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:55,750
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

112
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:57,491
[SPEAKER_06]: Like starting tomorrow.

113
00:06:57,911 --> 00:06:58,191
[SPEAKER_06]: Shit.

114
00:06:58,231 --> 00:06:58,872
[SPEAKER_02]: So you better call in.

115
00:06:59,622 --> 00:07:06,245
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks to my wife for telling me what I already knew.

116
00:07:06,265 --> 00:07:06,845
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck her!

117
00:07:07,185 --> 00:07:08,406
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought that was kind of the point.

118
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:09,806
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what got you in trouble.

119
00:07:12,687 --> 00:07:14,728
[SPEAKER_06]: I like mustard on my french fries.

120
00:07:17,389 --> 00:07:21,811
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell is happening to this program?

121
00:07:21,871 --> 00:07:22,691
[SPEAKER_03]: It imploded.

122
00:07:23,131 --> 00:07:24,732
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what the show needs more of?

123
00:07:26,413 --> 00:07:26,953
[SPEAKER_06]: Structure.

124
00:07:28,874 --> 00:07:33,478
[SPEAKER_06]: I swear to God, if she put on that Vuvuzela thing, I was going to throw her phone in the toilet.

125
00:07:33,778 --> 00:07:34,259
[SPEAKER_07]: Me too.

126
00:07:34,359 --> 00:07:34,639
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

127
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,201
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing.

128
00:07:36,221 --> 00:07:37,362
[SPEAKER_03]: Why did I forget my ferret?

129
00:07:37,982 --> 00:07:39,323
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you talking about, the Vuvuzela?

130
00:07:39,744 --> 00:07:42,226
[SPEAKER_06]: I have fucking no idea what you're talking about.

131
00:07:42,266 --> 00:07:42,907
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't do it.

132
00:07:43,387 --> 00:07:44,168
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll unplug your mic.

133
00:07:45,729 --> 00:07:47,931
[SPEAKER_06]: She's doing it here.

134
00:07:48,251 --> 00:07:49,372
[SPEAKER_06]: What are you grabbing me for?

135
00:07:51,341 --> 00:07:58,947
[SPEAKER_03]: For your information, Dan, for your information, Dan, four square, bitch.

136
00:07:59,147 --> 00:08:02,270
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I forgot to check in because I want to become the mayor of the house.

137
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:03,931
[SPEAKER_03]: You're never going to be the mayor of the house, Rob.

138
00:08:04,011 --> 00:08:04,552
[SPEAKER_03]: I check in every day.

139
00:08:04,572 --> 00:08:06,013
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I'm the mayor of Walgreens.

140
00:08:07,514 --> 00:08:11,317
[SPEAKER_03]: We went right by the Walgreens near my house, and I said, I should check in here.

141
00:08:11,677 --> 00:08:12,738
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob is the mayor.

142
00:08:12,858 --> 00:08:15,581
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob lives nowhere near the damn Walgreens by my house.

143
00:08:15,941 --> 00:08:17,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Rob is the mayor of Walgreens.

144
00:08:18,843 --> 00:08:19,444
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't feel bad.

145
00:08:19,464 --> 00:08:20,745
[SPEAKER_04]: How does this happen?

146
00:08:20,945 --> 00:08:21,405
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't feel bad.

147
00:08:21,425 --> 00:08:23,207
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm the mayor of the Walgreens across from my work.

148
00:08:23,547 --> 00:08:24,388
[SPEAKER_04]: And naturally my work.

149
00:08:24,608 --> 00:08:27,570
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm the mayor of a Chinese restaurant over by my house.

150
00:08:28,231 --> 00:08:29,272
[SPEAKER_03]: Aren't you the mayor of Cowschwitz?

151
00:08:29,992 --> 00:08:32,694
[SPEAKER_07]: I got dethroned as the mayor of Cowschwitz, which pissed me off.

152
00:08:32,775 --> 00:08:33,215
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, no.

153
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:37,739
[SPEAKER_07]: Melody was the mayor of Cowschwitz, and I was the mayor of Near the Stinky Cows on I-5.

154
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:38,960
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

155
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:39,700
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

156
00:08:40,941 --> 00:08:41,341
[SPEAKER_07]: And let's see.

157
00:08:41,362 --> 00:08:42,062
[SPEAKER_07]: What else am I the mayor of?

158
00:08:42,082 --> 00:08:43,023
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm the mayor of one other place.

159
00:08:43,578 --> 00:08:44,418
[SPEAKER_07]: and I can't remember what it is.

160
00:08:44,439 --> 00:08:44,839
[SPEAKER_07]: Walgreens.

161
00:08:45,219 --> 00:08:45,919
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's not Walgreens.

162
00:08:46,099 --> 00:08:48,641
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm the mayor of Walgreens, the Chinese restaurant and one other place.

163
00:08:48,681 --> 00:08:49,141
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't remember.

164
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:50,342
[SPEAKER_07]: Another Walgreens.

165
00:08:51,182 --> 00:08:53,364
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on.

166
00:08:53,464 --> 00:08:55,965
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob, you should create a place that calls the chair in Jamie's house.

167
00:08:57,446 --> 00:08:58,567
[SPEAKER_07]: The chair at Jamie's house.

168
00:08:59,447 --> 00:09:00,608
[SPEAKER_03]: I will let you be the mayor of the chair.

169
00:09:01,488 --> 00:09:02,669
[SPEAKER_06]: Practically in the closet.

170
00:09:03,449 --> 00:09:05,451
[SPEAKER_07]: In the closet at Jamie's house.

171
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:08,669
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right, Ranma.

172
00:09:08,689 --> 00:09:10,070
[SPEAKER_06]: The fabulous OLR Studios.

173
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:13,252
[SPEAKER_07]: Ranma in our chatroom says, Rob is the fabulous mayor of Walgreens.

174
00:09:13,292 --> 00:09:14,393
[SPEAKER_06]: Fabulous.

175
00:09:16,794 --> 00:09:18,315
[SPEAKER_07]: Am I really that gay, you guys?

176
00:09:18,415 --> 00:09:18,855
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on.

177
00:09:19,656 --> 00:09:21,577
[SPEAKER_07]: You are wearing a shirt with a hot dog on it.

178
00:09:21,617 --> 00:09:22,838
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no.

179
00:09:23,358 --> 00:09:25,499
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not just a shirt with a hot dog on it.

180
00:09:25,659 --> 00:09:26,900
[SPEAKER_03]: It has a rainbow, too.

181
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:27,841
[SPEAKER_07]: It does.

182
00:09:28,061 --> 00:09:28,421
[SPEAKER_07]: It does.

183
00:09:29,222 --> 00:09:32,423
[SPEAKER_07]: You should take a picture of my shirt, but I just don't want my fat old gut to be out there.

184
00:09:32,704 --> 00:09:34,285
[SPEAKER_04]: It just needs glitter to make it complete.

185
00:09:34,325 --> 00:09:34,545
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on.

186
00:09:34,585 --> 00:09:35,565
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm trying to see where I'm the mayor.

187
00:09:35,585 --> 00:09:36,446
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm the mayor of three places.

188
00:09:37,236 --> 00:09:38,137
[SPEAKER_07]: Jack in the Box!

189
00:09:38,437 --> 00:09:40,999
[SPEAKER_06]: You're the mayor of Jack in the Box.

190
00:09:41,239 --> 00:09:45,122
[SPEAKER_06]: A week ago, Jack in the Box sent out the most amazing coupon sheet.

191
00:09:45,182 --> 00:09:46,764
[SPEAKER_06]: It had all sorts of cool freebies on it.

192
00:09:48,865 --> 00:09:50,527
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob totally made the Pee Wee Herman face.

193
00:09:52,408 --> 00:09:52,689
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

194
00:09:52,769 --> 00:09:53,549
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I'm checking in.

195
00:09:53,589 --> 00:09:53,910
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on.

196
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:54,530
[SPEAKER_07]: Places.

197
00:09:57,192 --> 00:09:58,313
[SPEAKER_07]: I gotta be careful how I do this.

198
00:09:58,333 --> 00:09:59,434
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to tell the listeners where you live.

199
00:09:59,454 --> 00:10:00,735
[SPEAKER_06]: This is so too hot for the podcast.

200
00:10:00,815 --> 00:10:01,336
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, right?

201
00:10:01,376 --> 00:10:02,657
[SPEAKER_07]: This is amazing radio right now.

202
00:10:04,778 --> 00:10:06,260
[SPEAKER_07]: As Rob plays with his iPhone.

203
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:06,700
[SPEAKER_07]: Live!

204
00:10:07,256 --> 00:10:07,916
[SPEAKER_07]: On the air.

205
00:10:08,436 --> 00:10:09,717
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie is the mayor.

206
00:10:09,877 --> 00:10:10,277
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

207
00:10:10,317 --> 00:10:11,017
[SPEAKER_07]: Check in here.

208
00:10:11,037 --> 00:10:11,878
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck yes, I'm the mayor.

209
00:10:11,898 --> 00:10:12,398
[SPEAKER_07]: You're the mayor of where?

210
00:10:12,718 --> 00:10:13,218
[SPEAKER_03]: This house.

211
00:10:14,979 --> 00:10:15,319
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

212
00:10:15,339 --> 00:10:16,539
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

213
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:17,640
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just pathetic.

214
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,560
[SPEAKER_04]: At least on Foursquare.

215
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:29,524
[SPEAKER_01]: I just had to check to make sure my zipper was up when she took... All Games Radio is switching between its live and on-demand feed.

216
00:10:29,804 --> 00:10:31,005
[SPEAKER_01]: This may take several moments.

217
00:10:31,365 --> 00:10:31,805
[SPEAKER_01]: Visit all...

218
00:11:00,649 --> 00:11:09,855
[SPEAKER_08]: What happened?

219
00:11:19,662 --> 00:11:20,142
[SPEAKER_06]: Be back.

220
00:11:25,146 --> 00:11:25,426
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

221
00:11:25,606 --> 00:11:25,926
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

222
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:28,839
[SPEAKER_03]: Mad Libs Mad Libs

223
00:12:00,268 --> 00:12:01,228
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty good timing, though.

224
00:12:01,248 --> 00:12:02,889
[SPEAKER_04]: The claw.

225
00:12:03,029 --> 00:12:03,929
[SPEAKER_06]: It is our master.

226
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:06,830
[SPEAKER_03]: It decides who will go and who will stay.

227
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:09,912
[SPEAKER_07]: You can ask us anything you want.

228
00:12:10,372 --> 00:12:10,992
[SPEAKER_07]: Within reason.

229
00:12:11,732 --> 00:12:12,753
[SPEAKER_07]: Ask Orange Lounge.

230
00:12:12,893 --> 00:12:13,253
[SPEAKER_07]: Type.

231
00:12:13,693 --> 00:12:14,353
[SPEAKER_07]: Message.

232
00:12:14,653 --> 00:12:17,774
[SPEAKER_03]: You can ask anything unreasonable, but we may not answer it.

233
00:12:17,915 --> 00:12:19,615
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

234
00:12:20,075 --> 00:12:21,316
[SPEAKER_03]: Ask what color Misty's undies are.

235
00:12:21,456 --> 00:12:23,237
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to tell her.

236
00:12:23,297 --> 00:12:24,177
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to have to speak.

237
00:12:24,197 --> 00:12:25,537
[SPEAKER_03]: Because she'll tell you.

238
00:12:26,838 --> 00:12:27,138
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

239
00:12:28,556 --> 00:12:29,437
[SPEAKER_02]: She's checking.

240
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,101
[SPEAKER_05]: I just looked over.

241
00:12:38,364 --> 00:12:39,805
[SPEAKER_05]: Panties were hanging out.

242
00:12:42,027 --> 00:12:43,468
[SPEAKER_02]: It was all for you, Rob.

243
00:12:43,488 --> 00:12:44,929
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie's taking pictures.

244
00:12:47,776 --> 00:12:48,096
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

245
00:12:48,256 --> 00:12:49,557
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't even turn around.

246
00:12:50,617 --> 00:12:51,377
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob, Rob, Rob.

247
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,778
[SPEAKER_05]: Dan gets on the show, all hell breaks loose.

248
00:12:54,359 --> 00:12:55,339
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm making shit happen.

249
00:12:55,379 --> 00:12:57,580
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got girls taking their pants off.

250
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:58,260
[SPEAKER_05]: It's crazy.

251
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,741
[SPEAKER_05]: It's crazy around here.

252
00:13:00,941 --> 00:13:01,521
[SPEAKER_04]: Dan, dude.

253
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:02,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob, it's fine.

254
00:13:02,862 --> 00:13:04,682
[SPEAKER_05]: It's misty.

255
00:13:05,623 --> 00:13:08,664
[SPEAKER_05]: It's misty and misty being on the same time.

256
00:13:10,085 --> 00:13:11,245
[SPEAKER_07]: Do not put that on the internet.

257
00:13:11,285 --> 00:13:12,626
[SPEAKER_07]: I would not put that on the internet.

258
00:13:12,706 --> 00:13:14,326
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm putting it on our website.

259
00:13:14,366 --> 00:13:15,447
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't put it on the internet.

260
00:13:17,276 --> 00:13:18,897
[SPEAKER_07]: Look, stars!

261
00:13:19,477 --> 00:13:21,858
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, it's not like she's going beaver.

262
00:13:21,878 --> 00:13:24,300
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I want to watch Roger Rabbit.

263
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,581
[SPEAKER_07]: Can we do... Are you ready?

264
00:13:27,921 --> 00:13:29,382
[SPEAKER_07]: Ask OLR.

265
00:13:29,402 --> 00:13:31,523
[SPEAKER_07]: Look, every little red screen right there is a question.

266
00:13:31,623 --> 00:13:32,964
[SPEAKER_07]: So we got a lot of questions.

267
00:13:33,024 --> 00:13:33,444
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm seriously crying.

268
00:13:33,464 --> 00:13:33,604
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

269
00:13:38,019 --> 00:13:39,980
[SPEAKER_03]: Ranma says, I demand a fucking web camera.

270
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,561
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, can we go?

271
00:13:41,641 --> 00:13:42,061
[SPEAKER_07]: Can we go?

272
00:13:42,161 --> 00:13:43,342
[SPEAKER_07]: Tough shit, Ranma.

273
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:43,962
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, here we go.

274
00:13:44,843 --> 00:13:45,503
[SPEAKER_03]: Sing a song.

275
00:13:46,184 --> 00:13:48,145
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you help me out, Dan?

276
00:13:49,545 --> 00:13:52,527
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.

277
00:13:53,007 --> 00:13:56,389
[SPEAKER_07]: What will we find out tonight on Orange Lounge Radio?

278
00:13:56,709 --> 00:13:59,431
[SPEAKER_07]: Will we find out the color of Mystique's panties?

279
00:13:59,711 --> 00:14:02,613
[SPEAKER_07]: I deeply wish I had a lyric because I want to sing that song.

280
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:02,933
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm done.

281
00:14:03,953 --> 00:14:06,155
[SPEAKER_07]: That's like if we're trying to sing about some chick's panties.

282
00:14:06,195 --> 00:14:06,796
[SPEAKER_07]: It is very fun.

283
00:14:07,256 --> 00:14:09,898
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a good time singing the song with you.

284
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,542
[SPEAKER_07]: The greatest thing is this part isn't recorded.

285
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,117
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I do have a recording running.

286
00:14:20,177 --> 00:14:22,978
[SPEAKER_07]: I usually just throw this out, but tonight I might save it.

287
00:14:23,018 --> 00:14:25,479
[SPEAKER_02]: You should save it for the DVD that we're never going to do.

288
00:14:25,499 --> 00:14:26,279
[SPEAKER_07]: The DVD we're never going to do.

289
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:27,880
[SPEAKER_07]: We will do the DVD.

290
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:28,840
[SPEAKER_07]: Free with every t-shirt.

291
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,921
[SPEAKER_07]: We will do the DVD.

292
00:14:30,981 --> 00:14:33,441
[SPEAKER_04]: If we ever get the damn shirts out.

293
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:37,023
[SPEAKER_07]: Gold Anthro asks, what color are Misty's underwear?

294
00:14:39,323 --> 00:14:41,224
[SPEAKER_06]: They are blue with stars on them.

295
00:14:41,684 --> 00:14:43,305
[SPEAKER_02]: Stars and moons.

296
00:14:43,605 --> 00:14:44,265
[SPEAKER_02]: And moons.

297
00:14:44,983 --> 00:14:46,766
[SPEAKER_06]: But no pink diamonds or horseshoes.

298
00:14:48,729 --> 00:14:49,410
[SPEAKER_04]: Or Pikachus.

299
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:53,636
[SPEAKER_07]: DJ Blaziken asks, what was your first Bomani experience?

300
00:14:53,937 --> 00:14:55,339
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to defer this question to Dan.

301
00:14:55,559 --> 00:14:57,783
[SPEAKER_07]: What was your first Bomani experience?

302
00:15:01,193 --> 00:15:02,333
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess it would have been what?

303
00:15:02,973 --> 00:15:04,474
[SPEAKER_03]: Me bringing that Burn Over?

304
00:15:04,994 --> 00:15:06,834
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I mean, it was in the arcade for sure.

305
00:15:07,594 --> 00:15:10,815
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we had the... Down at Milpitas.

306
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:12,295
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it was at Disneyland.

307
00:15:12,775 --> 00:15:13,756
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it was before that.

308
00:15:14,296 --> 00:15:18,837
[SPEAKER_03]: We played DDR in 99 when they were first coming out in California.

309
00:15:18,897 --> 00:15:22,677
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember, though, pretty early on, I imported the Dreamcast version for Jamie.

310
00:15:22,697 --> 00:15:23,498
[SPEAKER_06]: He got it for me for my birthday.

311
00:15:23,518 --> 00:15:26,378
[SPEAKER_06]: That was probably the only version of DDR that I really bothered to play.

312
00:15:26,478 --> 00:15:29,919
[SPEAKER_06]: Then Julie bought a second dance pad, which I promptly stole from her and never gave back.

313
00:15:30,507 --> 00:15:31,449
[SPEAKER_03]: No, he's not kidding.

314
00:15:31,489 --> 00:15:32,370
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in the box.

315
00:15:32,891 --> 00:15:35,154
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, we still have it in the box.

316
00:15:37,417 --> 00:15:40,180
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you ask her about it, she'll probably say, oh, I should get that back from you.

317
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:47,831
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, my first momentary experience where I really enjoyed it was Guitar Freaks at Milpitas.

318
00:15:48,479 --> 00:16:06,325
[SPEAKER_06]: Which George got me to play because George was like, no, no, no, it's cool, you'll like this Because I was like, DJ, fuck that game, I'm gonna play Street Fighter And he was like, no, man, you gotta try Guitar Freaks, and I played Guitar Freaks And Guitar Freaks at first was the greatest Bimani game because you could suck at it, but it didn't hack you too hard

319
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:07,271
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate that fucking game.

320
00:16:29,867 --> 00:16:33,048
[SPEAKER_07]: Ranma asks, Sky, how fabulous are you?

321
00:16:34,369 --> 00:16:34,709
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?

322
00:16:35,409 --> 00:16:37,610
[SPEAKER_07]: I will defer to the others in studio.

323
00:16:37,891 --> 00:16:38,911
[SPEAKER_07]: How fabulous am I?

324
00:16:39,051 --> 00:16:43,193
[SPEAKER_03]: To quote Ulala, in a paraphrase, you are fabulous.

325
00:16:43,773 --> 00:16:44,554
[SPEAKER_03]: Hot dog!

326
00:16:46,935 --> 00:16:47,315
[SPEAKER_02]: Misty?

327
00:16:47,335 --> 00:16:48,275
[SPEAKER_02]: Boom shakalaka.

328
00:16:49,356 --> 00:16:52,577
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not quite sure brilliant comes to mind, though.

329
00:16:52,917 --> 00:16:53,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Jaguar!

330
00:16:54,178 --> 00:16:56,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Jaguar!

331
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:56,419
[SPEAKER_04]: Jaguar!

332
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:03,623
[SPEAKER_07]: SSJ100 Matt asks, how did Dan propose to Jamie?

333
00:17:04,984 --> 00:17:05,745
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you propose?

334
00:17:07,967 --> 00:17:08,907
[SPEAKER_07]: Even I know this story.

335
00:17:09,007 --> 00:17:10,889
[SPEAKER_07]: If I know this story and you two don't.

336
00:17:11,049 --> 00:17:13,131
[SPEAKER_03]: We just more like decided that we were going to do it.

337
00:17:13,351 --> 00:17:15,313
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it had something to do with pro wrestling.

338
00:17:15,533 --> 00:17:17,395
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no, no, no.

339
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:18,716
[SPEAKER_03]: We were watching UHF.

340
00:17:19,016 --> 00:17:19,857
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it UHF?

341
00:17:20,277 --> 00:17:21,338
[SPEAKER_06]: On Valentine's Day.

342
00:17:21,378 --> 00:17:23,480
[SPEAKER_06]: We were watching something and there was a lot of sex involved.

343
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,341
[SPEAKER_07]: And Jamie got to drink from the fire hose.

344
00:17:25,521 --> 00:17:26,362
[SPEAKER_07]: Just so you know.

345
00:17:28,024 --> 00:17:28,244
[SPEAKER_03]: Yuck.

346
00:17:30,089 --> 00:17:35,731
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but we were drinking, we were, no, this is how you knew that one day your wife would be Jewish.

347
00:17:36,232 --> 00:17:37,532
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we were drinking Manischewitz.

348
00:17:38,012 --> 00:17:39,613
[SPEAKER_06]: I fucking didn't know you were going to be Jewish.

349
00:17:41,054 --> 00:17:43,795
[SPEAKER_06]: I still barely, I still barely, I still don't even want to realize that.

350
00:17:45,716 --> 00:17:46,436
[SPEAKER_06]: Mazel Tov!

351
00:17:46,596 --> 00:17:47,917
[SPEAKER_06]: Mazel Tov!

352
00:17:48,377 --> 00:17:50,818
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to get seven days of presents.

353
00:17:51,705 --> 00:17:56,509
[SPEAKER_07]: I love pencils and erasers.

354
00:17:56,549 --> 00:17:58,210
[SPEAKER_07]: Dan is a real humanitarian.

355
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:00,592
[SPEAKER_07]: He tries to see the good in everything.

356
00:18:00,672 --> 00:18:01,632
[SPEAKER_07]: My wife's going to be Jewish.

357
00:18:01,933 --> 00:18:04,875
[SPEAKER_05]: Eight days of presents!

358
00:18:08,097 --> 00:18:09,838
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay, two Christmases!

359
00:18:10,259 --> 00:18:17,684
[SPEAKER_03]: I just now see the irony in the proposed, the sort of co-decision.

360
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:24,562
[SPEAKER_07]: When are you all coming to New York City?

361
00:18:25,183 --> 00:18:26,484
[SPEAKER_00]: New York City?

362
00:18:26,524 --> 00:18:41,338
[SPEAKER_07]: Get a rope When I ain't a broke ass When Sister Act is on Broadway Yeah, I need to accumulate some money before I can come crash When someone invites me for free I've never been to New York

363
00:18:42,017 --> 00:18:42,377
[SPEAKER_03]: I have.

364
00:18:43,398 --> 00:18:44,539
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty fantastic.

365
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,601
[SPEAKER_04]: I do love New York.

366
00:18:46,761 --> 00:18:50,685
[SPEAKER_03]: This is how long ago I went to New York.

367
00:18:51,506 --> 00:18:55,009
[SPEAKER_03]: There were still these really two large buildings and one of them had a hole in it.

368
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:58,392
[SPEAKER_06]: There are so many ways to die in New York City.

369
00:18:59,253 --> 00:19:00,534
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Dennis Leary.

370
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:03,957
[SPEAKER_03]: But Rob, does that date when I went?

371
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:05,499
[SPEAKER_06]: Start spreading the news.

372
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,841
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I've already been to Chicago sometimes.

373
00:19:08,334 --> 00:19:09,094
[SPEAKER_07]: I love New York.

374
00:19:09,395 --> 00:19:10,095
[SPEAKER_07]: Chicago.

375
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:12,816
[SPEAKER_07]: I have the best nights out in New York City.

376
00:19:12,876 --> 00:19:13,337
[SPEAKER_07]: You know why?

377
00:19:13,377 --> 00:19:14,577
[SPEAKER_07]: Because they never end.

378
00:19:15,117 --> 00:19:16,798
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to go to New York with Rob.

379
00:19:17,459 --> 00:19:18,599
[SPEAKER_07]: We will have the best time.

380
00:19:18,639 --> 00:19:19,920
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to go to Broadway.

381
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,361
[SPEAKER_02]: Broadway.

382
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:22,861
[SPEAKER_02]: Next question.

383
00:19:22,961 --> 00:19:25,463
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to go see Mamma Mia on Broadway.

384
00:19:25,483 --> 00:19:28,244
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we can make Go LRG finally happen and it can happen in New York.

385
00:19:28,769 --> 00:19:31,690
[SPEAKER_07]: Giovedea is asking quite a few questions here.

386
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:33,110
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of them have already been asked.

387
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:34,291
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll start here.

388
00:19:34,811 --> 00:19:37,732
[SPEAKER_07]: If you had Lady Tatas, what would their names be?

389
00:19:38,192 --> 00:19:39,052
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh, Dan.

390
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:43,133
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe that could be Lady Gaga's sidekick, Lady Tata.

391
00:19:46,874 --> 00:19:48,935
[SPEAKER_07]: Dr. Evil and Professor Chaos.

392
00:19:49,795 --> 00:19:52,956
[SPEAKER_07]: I think mine would have, well, on that note, then I would have to name one.

393
00:19:53,096 --> 00:19:53,696
[SPEAKER_07]: Alejandro.

394
00:19:53,716 --> 00:19:53,896
[SPEAKER_07]: Alejandro.

395
00:19:54,597 --> 00:19:56,159
[SPEAKER_07]: and the other one, I don't know.

396
00:19:56,699 --> 00:19:57,120
[SPEAKER_07]: Enrique.

397
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:57,700
[SPEAKER_07]: Telephone.

398
00:19:57,721 --> 00:20:01,044
[SPEAKER_07]: Rikki Martin.

399
00:20:01,264 --> 00:20:02,726
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Rikki Martin and Alejandro.

400
00:20:02,766 --> 00:20:03,066
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

401
00:20:04,888 --> 00:20:07,791
[SPEAKER_07]: And Giovedeo wants to know, Rob, will you be my gay boyfriend?

402
00:20:09,814 --> 00:20:11,275
[SPEAKER_03]: Have we ever played that song on the show before?

403
00:20:11,295 --> 00:20:12,396
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have a lot of money?

404
00:20:12,537 --> 00:20:15,360
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, when it comes to being the hag...

405
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:22,334
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkTetsuya says, since there probably won't be a show, can we finally run the best of next week?

406
00:20:22,374 --> 00:20:25,796
[SPEAKER_03]: If I'm not too lazy to upload it to the all game server, sure.

407
00:20:42,736 --> 00:20:44,757
[SPEAKER_07]: Just get on me about that mid-week and I'll make sure it happens.

408
00:20:45,537 --> 00:20:47,819
[SPEAKER_07]: ToyGak asks, oh, a game question.

409
00:20:47,859 --> 00:20:49,340
[SPEAKER_07]: What is that, a video game question?

410
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,321
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought he was going to ask me what color undies I was wearing.

411
00:20:51,581 --> 00:20:52,062
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, here we go.

412
00:20:53,222 --> 00:21:04,570
[SPEAKER_07]: ToyGak asks, Would you rather have a game with an amazing storyline but last-gen graphics or amazing graphics and a poor storyline?

413
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:07,752
[SPEAKER_03]: I would go with amazing storyline.

414
00:21:10,336 --> 00:21:16,218
[SPEAKER_06]: Graphics cease to mean anything after your first few hours of playing the game, so the storyline is pretty much vital.

415
00:21:17,659 --> 00:21:18,979
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you comparing panties?

416
00:21:19,059 --> 00:21:20,440
[SPEAKER_06]: What is going on over there?

417
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,781
[SPEAKER_07]: Take off your shirts!

418
00:21:24,201 --> 00:21:28,943
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh god, she did it!

419
00:21:29,223 --> 00:21:30,924
[SPEAKER_05]: Shit's getting crazy up in here!

420
00:21:31,184 --> 00:21:32,484
[SPEAKER_05]: Where's the malt liquor?

421
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:37,486
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not my panties I was talking about.

422
00:21:37,506 --> 00:21:38,306
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way, very nice.

423
00:21:45,303 --> 00:21:52,325
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I want amazing graphics and poor storyline because you know the spanking game has no storyline whatsoever and that sounds better than anything else.

424
00:21:52,945 --> 00:21:55,846
[SPEAKER_07]: Spanking and massage.

425
00:21:56,326 --> 00:21:57,006
[SPEAKER_07]: Simspank.

426
00:21:57,386 --> 00:21:58,166
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the next question?

427
00:21:59,066 --> 00:22:00,567
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm getting to it, I'm getting to it.

428
00:22:01,327 --> 00:22:04,127
[SPEAKER_07]: Toagak also asks, why are there so many nicknames for boobs?

429
00:22:04,227 --> 00:22:05,988
[SPEAKER_07]: Boobs, knockers, tits, fun bags, etc.

430
00:22:08,933 --> 00:22:09,393
[SPEAKER_03]: Jumblies.

431
00:22:10,134 --> 00:22:10,894
[SPEAKER_07]: Why not?

432
00:22:12,315 --> 00:22:15,097
[SPEAKER_07]: Because breasts sound so formal.

433
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:20,702
[SPEAKER_04]: People do stupid shit like name their cars, so why not?

434
00:22:21,402 --> 00:22:24,785
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a song that talks about the many names of a penis.

435
00:22:26,526 --> 00:22:27,407
[SPEAKER_03]: Monty Python did it.

436
00:22:27,667 --> 00:22:28,508
[SPEAKER_06]: Tallywhacker.

437
00:22:29,628 --> 00:22:31,049
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't it awfully nice to have a penis?

438
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:32,951
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't it awfully good to have a dung?

439
00:22:34,092 --> 00:22:36,674
[SPEAKER_02]: Your piece of pork, your wife's best friend, your pussy or your cock.

440
00:22:37,155 --> 00:22:38,416
[SPEAKER_02]: You can wrap it up in ribbons.

441
00:22:38,436 --> 00:22:39,997
[SPEAKER_07]: You can stick it in your sock.

442
00:22:40,318 --> 00:22:44,862
[SPEAKER_07]: Amaze Satsuma says, can you give me a job slash occupation for Mad Libs?

443
00:22:45,302 --> 00:22:46,023
[SPEAKER_07]: Jizzmopper.

444
00:22:50,194 --> 00:22:51,855
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I prefer Cumbucket.

445
00:22:51,875 --> 00:22:52,796
[SPEAKER_07]: Erotic Engineer.

446
00:22:56,298 --> 00:22:57,719
[SPEAKER_03]: I like Cumbucket.

447
00:22:57,819 --> 00:22:58,440
[SPEAKER_07]: Frisbee.

448
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:01,982
[SPEAKER_07]: Dear Strong Bad, how do you type with boxing gloves on your hands?

449
00:23:02,403 --> 00:23:03,484
[SPEAKER_07]: Wrong show.

450
00:23:04,264 --> 00:23:06,286
[SPEAKER_07]: That question was totally crappy.

451
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:10,590
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

452
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:11,711
[SPEAKER_07]: That was all the questions.

453
00:23:12,091 --> 00:23:13,232
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a question, Rob.

454
00:23:13,552 --> 00:23:13,793
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

455
00:23:14,233 --> 00:23:15,474
[SPEAKER_03]: What the fuck are we on?

456
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:16,034
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

457
00:23:16,414 --> 00:23:18,736
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's going to do it for Ask Orange Lounge.

458
00:23:18,816 --> 00:23:20,197
[SPEAKER_07]: All Games Radio!

459
00:23:20,297 --> 00:23:21,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Who said we need to be on anything?

460
00:23:23,163 --> 00:23:23,983
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not even unbiking it.

461
00:23:24,023 --> 00:23:27,245
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all the time we have for Ask Orange Lounge.

462
00:23:27,565 --> 00:23:30,886
[SPEAKER_07]: We hope you learned something tonight on Orange Lounge Radio.

463
00:23:31,727 --> 00:23:32,907
[SPEAKER_07]: SD has blue panties.

464
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:34,608
[SPEAKER_07]: Blue underwear.

465
00:23:34,968 --> 00:23:38,270
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all I learned and now I'm scarred for the rest of the night.

466
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:40,511
[SPEAKER_08]: Good for you.

467
00:23:42,512 --> 00:23:42,832
[SPEAKER_07]: P.S.

468
00:23:42,852 --> 00:23:43,292
[SPEAKER_07]: Jizzmonger.

469
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:48,473
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, Ranma's asking a serious question.

470
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:49,956
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, this is a serious question.

471
00:23:50,256 --> 00:23:50,517
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh-oh.

472
00:23:50,597 --> 00:23:51,037
[SPEAKER_07]: Downer.

473
00:23:51,218 --> 00:23:54,182
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, Ranma's saying... Thanks, Ranma.

474
00:23:54,222 --> 00:23:55,464
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think I've ever told this on a show.

475
00:23:55,484 --> 00:23:56,286
[SPEAKER_07]: Are we really going to do this?

476
00:23:56,546 --> 00:23:56,907
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure, why not?

477
00:23:56,947 --> 00:23:57,167
[SPEAKER_07]: Do it.

478
00:23:57,367 --> 00:24:00,753
[SPEAKER_07]: Ranma says, when did you come out of the closet and how did your family take it?

479
00:24:01,923 --> 00:24:02,963
[SPEAKER_07]: Dan, do you want to answer this?

480
00:24:04,324 --> 00:24:06,044
[SPEAKER_06]: They knew when I was young.

481
00:24:06,064 --> 00:24:14,587
[SPEAKER_03]: In Dan's case, when they finally removed the deadbolt and he came out blinking into the sunlight for the first time in 13 years.

482
00:24:14,607 --> 00:24:16,448
[SPEAKER_06]: They were all surprisingly accepting.

483
00:24:16,688 --> 00:24:17,288
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the deal.

484
00:24:17,308 --> 00:24:17,728
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the deal.

485
00:24:18,189 --> 00:24:21,930
[SPEAKER_07]: My mom asked me for like three months straight every day, are you gay?

486
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:22,670
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you gay?

487
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:22,990
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you gay?

488
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:24,371
[SPEAKER_07]: And it kind of got annoying.

489
00:24:24,451 --> 00:24:25,051
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, because

490
00:24:25,424 --> 00:24:26,165
[SPEAKER_07]: This is what it was.

491
00:24:26,625 --> 00:24:34,153
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't like the fact, you know, because I had a tough time in high school because I got called fag and all that stuff a lot in high school and I didn't really like it.

492
00:24:34,454 --> 00:24:39,039
[SPEAKER_07]: And I didn't really know I was gay then because I was just trying to be normal, you know, have a girlfriend and, you know, this is how we roll.

493
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:42,102
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I'm a hot stud playing the clarinet in the marching band, right?

494
00:24:42,529 --> 00:24:49,251
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, and trying to do that whole thing, I didn't really want to admit I was gay because I didn't want all those people to be right.

495
00:24:49,911 --> 00:24:53,313
[SPEAKER_07]: But then when I kind of realized I was gay, like I, that was one of the first things I had to conquer.

496
00:24:53,353 --> 00:24:56,233
[SPEAKER_07]: So when my mom joined in on it, I really didn't appreciate it.

497
00:24:56,574 --> 00:25:00,895
[SPEAKER_07]: Finally, one day it actually kind of exploded in a, yes, are you happy?

498
00:25:00,975 --> 00:25:01,815
[SPEAKER_07]: Now leave me alone.

499
00:25:01,855 --> 00:25:03,696
[SPEAKER_07]: And she ran off to her room to cry for the rest of the day.

500
00:25:04,316 --> 00:25:04,877
[SPEAKER_07]: Bitches.

501
00:25:04,937 --> 00:25:05,317
[SPEAKER_07]: Bitches.

502
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:05,477
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

503
00:25:05,497 --> 00:25:05,557
[SPEAKER_07]: But...

504
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:39,147
[SPEAKER_07]: Then the next day she came out with her eyes all puffy and she's like, I just want you to know I still love you and I've known since you were four.

505
00:25:40,308 --> 00:25:41,328
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm like, how do you know?

506
00:25:41,589 --> 00:25:43,751
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't know until I was like 17.

507
00:25:43,811 --> 00:25:44,911
[SPEAKER_07]: How do you know when you're four?

508
00:25:45,292 --> 00:25:46,833
[SPEAKER_02]: Because mothers always know.

509
00:25:46,853 --> 00:25:51,637
[SPEAKER_06]: We had a kid in my family, my eldest cousin, who was gay.

510
00:25:52,398 --> 00:25:53,719
[SPEAKER_06]: I miss him.

511
00:25:53,899 --> 00:25:54,379
[SPEAKER_06]: I never...

512
00:25:55,653 --> 00:25:57,574
[SPEAKER_06]: I never put too and too into it.

513
00:25:57,614 --> 00:25:58,655
[SPEAKER_06]: It was just he was who he was.

514
00:25:58,735 --> 00:26:04,579
[SPEAKER_06]: But my folks and people in my family were always like, we knew from the time he was a young, young boy that he was gay.

515
00:26:05,959 --> 00:26:11,703
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a part of me that doesn't like that, though, because it insinuates that being gay you act a certain way, and I don't think that's true.

516
00:26:13,284 --> 00:26:14,745
[SPEAKER_07]: As I sit here with my legs crossed.

517
00:26:14,785 --> 00:26:16,206
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so fucking true, though.

518
00:26:16,246 --> 00:26:16,986
[SPEAKER_07]: Tapping on the table.

519
00:26:17,286 --> 00:26:20,168
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not like you can't act gay if you're straight.

520
00:26:20,188 --> 00:26:21,469
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't act straight if you're gay, but...

521
00:26:22,506 --> 00:26:26,091
[SPEAKER_07]: But what is straight acting and gay acting?

522
00:26:26,131 --> 00:26:27,032
[SPEAKER_07]: There's not, you know.

523
00:26:27,473 --> 00:26:28,615
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I'm talking about.

524
00:26:28,675 --> 00:26:28,875
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

525
00:26:28,935 --> 00:26:30,577
[SPEAKER_07]: You fucking know what I'm talking about.

526
00:26:30,637 --> 00:26:31,258
[SPEAKER_06]: I do, but.

527
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:33,622
[SPEAKER_06]: And I understand, I'm not trying to perpetuate the stereotype.

528
00:26:33,662 --> 00:26:34,683
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I appreciate that.

529
00:26:34,703 --> 00:26:37,888
[SPEAKER_06]: But like, I looked at Rob when I first met you and I was like, wow.

530
00:26:40,413 --> 00:27:08,418
[SPEAKER_07]: and you're not wearing like feather boas and shit although he has I didn't come in and go hi Dan I was just like oh you know not in a bad way Dan's gaydar has improved I wasn't threatening I probably had my arm around Jamie and we were skipping and Dan was like somehow this is not threatening to me I'm not a threatened kind of guy that's true that's true

531
00:27:09,638 --> 00:27:13,519
[SPEAKER_03]: Dan knows that I have complete and utter devotion to the gays.

532
00:27:14,359 --> 00:27:15,940
[SPEAKER_03]: To the gays, exactly.

533
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:20,681
[SPEAKER_06]: The truth is, you know, I realize that any who oppose me can be summarily dealt with.

534
00:27:21,121 --> 00:27:25,222
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, dealt with.

535
00:27:25,282 --> 00:27:25,602
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

536
00:27:25,622 --> 00:27:28,102
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know what I finally told my mom about that I had a girlfriend before?

537
00:27:28,602 --> 00:27:28,862
[SPEAKER_07]: Really?

538
00:27:28,962 --> 00:27:29,543
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what she said?

539
00:27:29,603 --> 00:27:29,803
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

540
00:27:30,303 --> 00:27:31,043
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't need to hear that.

541
00:27:32,199 --> 00:27:32,539
[SPEAKER_06]: Me either.

542
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,541
[SPEAKER_07]: You do?

543
00:27:34,561 --> 00:27:43,709
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well, here's the other thing that's important, because my mom said, and this is a very important part of the story, is my mom said, I called your grandma, and I told her, I'm like, why are you telling everybody?

544
00:27:44,149 --> 00:27:46,691
[SPEAKER_07]: She's like, no, I want you to know what your grandma said, because it meant a lot.

545
00:27:47,051 --> 00:27:49,593
[SPEAKER_07]: She said, I told your grandma that you were gay, and I'm like, what'd she say?

546
00:27:50,014 --> 00:27:51,935
[SPEAKER_07]: And my grandma said, so what?

547
00:27:55,078 --> 00:27:57,380
[SPEAKER_07]: So rest in peace, Grandma Shaw.

548
00:27:57,762 --> 00:27:58,022
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

549
00:27:58,763 --> 00:27:59,063
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow.

550
00:27:59,083 --> 00:28:01,324
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Dan, I do miss your cousin.

551
00:28:01,945 --> 00:28:02,345
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, me too.

552
00:28:02,365 --> 00:28:04,006
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I got along really well with your cousin.

553
00:28:04,126 --> 00:28:05,267
[SPEAKER_06]: He was a cool cat.

554
00:28:06,727 --> 00:28:08,929
[SPEAKER_07]: No, we'll talk about that.

555
00:28:09,009 --> 00:28:11,350
[SPEAKER_07]: Lastly, God, it's like the all-gay OLR.

556
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:14,872
[SPEAKER_07]: DJ Blaziken asks, what do you think about Prop 8 being put in the fire?

557
00:28:15,993 --> 00:28:20,696
[SPEAKER_07]: Obviously, obviously it needed to happen, and it's a good thing, but

558
00:28:21,295 --> 00:28:22,016
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

559
00:28:31,909 --> 00:28:34,970
[SPEAKER_07]: But honestly, this issue just isn't over until the Supreme Court decides on it.

560
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:37,071
[SPEAKER_07]: And I am a little nervous about the Supreme Court deciding.

561
00:28:37,091 --> 00:28:38,872
[SPEAKER_07]: Whose rights are we going to take away next?

562
00:28:39,412 --> 00:28:50,976
[SPEAKER_07]: I just hope that history and things that happened in, you know, Loving v. Virginia and some of these other things that happened in the past will kind of set the precedence for overturning Prop 8 at the Supreme Court level.

563
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:52,097
[SPEAKER_07]: But I worry.

564
00:28:52,497 --> 00:28:58,199
[SPEAKER_07]: There's unfortunately that many ignoramus people in the world who, for whatever reason, want to have their say in my life.

565
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:01,741
[SPEAKER_03]: The moment they bring the 14th Amendment into it, you know it becomes an even bigger issue.

566
00:29:02,602 --> 00:29:10,587
[SPEAKER_03]: And I kind of think that some of those pro-Prop 8 people might actually have more to fear if it goes to the Supreme Court.

567
00:29:11,107 --> 00:29:18,872
[SPEAKER_03]: Because then if they uphold the ruling that yes, this is unconstitutional, that's national precedent.

568
00:29:19,092 --> 00:29:22,294
[SPEAKER_06]: They're a bunch of scared-ass, insecure fuckers.

569
00:29:22,514 --> 00:29:23,475
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, it's just like, what?

570
00:29:27,361 --> 00:29:35,925
[SPEAKER_07]: I assure you, I don't want to have my wedding in a church and I'm not going to sue any church that doesn't want to have my wedding because I'm not...

571
00:29:37,631 --> 00:29:39,872
[SPEAKER_07]: I just, people can do whatever they want to do.

572
00:29:40,172 --> 00:29:40,873
[SPEAKER_03]: No, here's what I have to say.

573
00:29:40,893 --> 00:29:42,053
[SPEAKER_07]: You can do whatever you want to do.

574
00:29:42,133 --> 00:29:43,114
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me do what I want to do.

575
00:29:44,094 --> 00:29:45,295
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob, here's what I have to say.

576
00:29:45,595 --> 00:29:45,735
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

577
00:29:46,056 --> 00:29:58,022
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it okay if, you know, the fundamental Christians want to use Leviticus as their standing point for saying, you know, which is actually in Jewish law, man shall not lay with another man like a woman.

578
00:29:58,582 --> 00:30:00,425
[SPEAKER_03]: That just means that I guess you can't have boobs or something.

579
00:30:01,407 --> 00:30:10,420
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, if the Christians want to use Leviticus, they also have to keep kosher and grow out their beards and wear tall black hats like the Hasidic do.

580
00:30:10,891 --> 00:30:39,956
[SPEAKER_03]: I put the fun in fundamentalist well it's not even quote the bible all you want or any religious text but there's like an amendment in the constitution that says freedom of religion meaning I am free of your religion well see and that's my other point I mean my point is that if they're trying to use if they're trying to use a law when they admittedly don't follow the laws themselves then that's just being hypocritical

581
00:30:42,579 --> 00:30:43,419
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the end of the thing.

582
00:30:43,779 --> 00:30:49,022
[SPEAKER_07]: I am encouraged by the fact that folks our age, and I see a lot of people in chat going, I have a gay friend, who cares?

583
00:30:49,362 --> 00:30:49,822
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't care.

584
00:30:50,202 --> 00:30:56,045
[SPEAKER_07]: And that seems to be the attitude of most 18 to 35 year olds in this day and age.

585
00:30:56,065 --> 00:30:57,025
[SPEAKER_07]: They just need to vote.

586
00:30:57,165 --> 00:31:03,408
[SPEAKER_07]: So the good news is, when we're the old farts on the Supreme Court making the decisions, this will be over.

587
00:31:04,328 --> 00:31:07,570
[SPEAKER_07]: We're just going to have to wait for the ignorant people to pass on.

588
00:31:08,317 --> 00:31:24,805
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, if you take a look at the Civil Rights Movement, the 14th Amendment passed 100 years before Brown versus the Board of Education and the Montgomery Boycott, the Montgomery Best Boycott with Rosa Parks.

589
00:31:25,566 --> 00:31:27,807
[SPEAKER_07]: And so how many of us our age look back on that and go,

590
00:31:28,257 --> 00:31:30,238
[SPEAKER_07]: So even if I'm not around to see it

591
00:31:58,468 --> 00:32:01,390
[SPEAKER_07]: I know someday it will change.

592
00:32:10,498 --> 00:32:16,981
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just saying, if anyone is still listening, make sure that when the opportunity comes up for you to vote on important issues like this, that you do it.

593
00:32:17,021 --> 00:32:21,823
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I was watching the voter turnout during the whole Prop 8 thing, and I was completely dismayed.

594
00:32:21,983 --> 00:32:27,865
[SPEAKER_03]: We were really relying on the Berkeley area, and the voter turnout was only something like 52%.

595
00:32:29,986 --> 00:32:33,931
[SPEAKER_03]: And it could have completely turned the whole thing because the vote was 52 to 49.

596
00:32:35,873 --> 00:32:40,959
[SPEAKER_03]: Just if the rest of the voting population had put in the effort, it wouldn't have even been an issue.

597
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:42,881
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I'm just saying.

598
00:32:43,356 --> 00:32:49,182
[SPEAKER_07]: This was a very interesting election year, though, because either way the tide had gone, you were going to have a minority in the White House.

599
00:32:49,362 --> 00:32:52,665
[SPEAKER_07]: Either you had a racial minority or you had a sexual minority.

600
00:32:53,046 --> 00:32:57,290
[SPEAKER_07]: You would have had one crazy-ass fucking woman in the White House, but you would have had a woman in the White House, you know?

601
00:32:59,052 --> 00:32:59,512
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

602
00:32:59,712 --> 00:33:00,133
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

603
00:33:00,593 --> 00:33:02,735
[SPEAKER_03]: I think my problem with Hillary is that she...

604
00:33:03,636 --> 00:33:04,436
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm not even talking to her.

605
00:33:04,476 --> 00:33:05,357
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm talking to Sarah Palin.

606
00:33:05,617 --> 00:33:10,159
[SPEAKER_07]: Hillary hasn't been to primaries.

607
00:33:10,199 --> 00:33:15,102
[SPEAKER_07]: But whatever happened, you would have had a minority in the White House when we were there.

608
00:33:15,222 --> 00:33:20,624
[SPEAKER_03]: I felt... Two minorities right there.

609
00:33:20,724 --> 00:33:22,005
[SPEAKER_03]: Two minorities in one.

610
00:33:22,025 --> 00:33:23,866
[SPEAKER_03]: Mystique's going to run and that's going to be the bill.

611
00:33:23,886 --> 00:33:24,726
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what we need.

612
00:33:25,347 --> 00:33:27,388
[SPEAKER_03]: What we need, Rob, is a Jewish black woman.

613
00:33:29,288 --> 00:33:30,329
