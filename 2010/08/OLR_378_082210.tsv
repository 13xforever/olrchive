15861	25308	2010, a new drawing tablet is announced for the Wii, Goldeneye is set to get Golden Wii accessories, and could a recent PC cult classic be coming to Xbox Live and PSN?
32270	36574	Hello my friends on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36654	42580	We are that show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
42600	45483	We like to think of ourselves as the place where every gamer has a voice.
46063	46964	My name is Rob Roberts.
46984	49927	I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my awesome co-host.
50307	53230	Say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
53430	55851	Dan's 3 Bean Salad is amazing and you should have some.
79821	87445	I may have to a little later when I'm finished downing these yummy parmesan garlic and herb pita chips that I managed to eat the entire bag over the course of a week.
87465	89766	We should totally take a picture of you modeling them, Rob.
90386	91467	Perhaps I will in a moment.
91527	92007	Maybe later.
92067	94188	Then the whole chat can see my Journey shirt.
94830	96892	I actually just realized that my phone is in the bedroom and I'm too lazy to go get it.
110296	112257	I'm not, I'm not, because I've had a change of heart.
112277	112437	Mm-hmm.
140928	144189	We can talk about that later, but I want to introduce because he's back.
144269	144910	We've missed him.
144950	147971	He's been gone for a few weeks, but he is back in the house tonight.
148491	149751	Say hello to Loki.
149952	150352	Hello.
150372	151152	Techmaster Loki.
151192	151872	How are you doing?
152412	152993	I'm fine.
153193	154753	Tell us about the baby.
154833	155534	We all want to know.
155634	156894	He's not doing much.
157634	161116	He just pretty much sleeps and poops and eats and that's about it.
161196	166458	He's awake every now and then for a few hours, but we've been trying to get him to sleep a little bit better at night.
166878	168280	He looks like it's kind of funny at night.
168420	171122	He, I guess, doesn't sleep too deeply.
171643	175507	And it looks like he makes all these like kind of arm and leg movements.
175527	177849	So it looks like he's fighting somebody in his sleep.
177969	178790	And it's kind of funny.
180412	181553	Hopefully it's not his father.
182133	185737	No, he's just like, and like kicking his legs up and stuff.
185957	186358	Interesting.
186798	188240	Has he resisted the swaddling?
189200	190582	He doesn't like to be swaddled, really.
190905	191946	Neither did Becky's son.
192766	195869	They always say that babies should be swaddled when they're really young.
196569	199051	I've seen more babies than not just completely hate it.
199211	201133	It's so weird that everybody has babies now.
201473	202313	He liked it at first.
202394	203694	It's just I think he gets hot.
203795	206577	He takes after me, so we run really warm.
207757	216384	It's not fun to have a tight blanket on you when you're really hot.
216424	218225	There was one picture of him that I have to say.
218265	219226	He looked like a little monkey.
220131	221072	He does look like a little monkey.
221092	224235	He also looks like... Oh, what's his name?
227058	228520	One of the kids from Malcolm in the Middle.
231324	231664	Wow.
232645	232945	Dewey.
233385	235087	He looks like Dewey from Malcolm in the Mill.
235747	243993	Let's go to our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com where our chatters can chat with us live as we do tape Sunday nights at All Games Radio.
244633	247015	www.allgames.com is where you can listen to our show live.
247055	251758	We do tape 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show at All Games Radio.
251778	257863	But if you want to chat live during the show, you've got to go to a different website, chat.orangeloungeradio.com and, you know, that's
258603	260545	That's our thing, where every gamer has a voice.
260585	269252	You know, yeah, we talk about news, but I'm sure most of you that go to the trouble to download gaming blogs, or download gaming podcasts, probably also read gaming blogs.
269452	273815	So I know you get your news from there, but we talk about it with you guys and get some different perspectives.
274296	276578	But tonight, it's a lot of questions about Loki.
277318	279240	ToyGak says, holy shit, I missed you.
279480	282683	I don't know if he's talking about the show in general or Loki or both or what, but there you go.
283063	284585	Spazinator says, you were gone.
285886	286527	LOL, JK.
287968	289950	DJ Dark Knight says, where's our cigars?
290270	290550	I don't know.
290650	292692	Is that a tradition people still do anymore?
292993	293853	I didn't think... I don't know.
293893	299699	I thought after all the whole, like, smoking kills stuff, you know, and they really frown on smoking in general.
299739	301000	They don't do the cigars so much anymore.
301260	304203	I've seen candy cigars, but not the real ones.
304243	305124	Yeah, I don't know.
305804	310567	Bobby Blackwolf, the man who does the show before us here at All Games Radio, has a great question.
310847	312448	Does he appreciate the nursery?
312648	317451	He doesn't really use the nursery yet because he's still sleeping in our room in a little portable crib.
317511	319192	He will eventually use the nursery.
321333	321933	No, not yet.
321973	323594	He does not appreciate the nursery yet.
323654	325635	I don't think he can even see the nursery yet.
325675	333339	He really only can see about 8 to 12 inches in front of him because his eyes aren't fully developed yet.
333520	334260	He can see red though.
335714	336314	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
349916	351617	Just like, goes crazy.
351717	354699	So, yeah, I'm sure he will appreciate it later on.
354739	356579	He's just, he's a little young right now.
356679	360041	Were you here the week we talked about how your pictures got on a gaming blog?
360061	361342	Or was that the night Josh was born?
361862	363663	I think that was the week that Josh was born.
363723	365304	Yeah, your pictures made it onto what?
365364	366464	Game Informer or something?
366484	367685	Some pretty big magazine.
368185	374428	And we were kind of like laughing because it had nothing to do with the fact that you're here on Orange Launch Radio, which, you know, it's fine.
374468	377670	Nobody listens to the show except the few faithful folks we've had over the years.
378651	383435	But you just cracked me up because they found your photos on Flickr and thought it made for a good story.
383676	392384	But I think that just goes to show, yeah, sure, a lot of people may have thought of doing a Mario-themed nursery for their babies, but Matt took the full...
393325	394045	Thanks for watching!
410051	413994	He'll never realize what cool parents he has doing his room in the video game theme.
414575	425323	Because by the time he's a teenager, well, obviously the room will be changed by the time he's a teenager, but by the time he's like, you know, it's time for that nursery theme to be changed, he'll probably be like, man, video games are lame.
425804	428346	All my dad does is talk about video games.
429807	431829	No, he won't do that.
433999	434580	I'm just messing.
434860	441390	Alright, look, I... Maybe spoil, because you're like, oh, and they're like, oh man, I really wish I had like a Wii 2 or something.
441410	443033	Be like, ah, I already got that.
443534	445036	I bought that for myself.
445196	446719	But hey, you can use it if you want, you know.
446819	448882	He'll never get to play them because his dad will always be using it.
449144	449685	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
467246	468788	Oh, what a weekend I've had.
468968	469669	I'm hanging in there.
469869	472793	Tell us about it, because your weekend and my weekend were very similar.
472833	480762	Yes, we had a road trip up to Reno because the Rocky Horror Troupe that Rob is a part of was doing a Rocky Horror performance for about...
482844	483504	3,500 people, we think?
484044	485405	The number is still debated.
485605	487126	Like, I've heard everywhere from 2,000 to 6,800.
487546	491228	And they do it in an arena.
491468	494370	It's definitely the largest showing they do regularly in the country.
494410	497032	I think there was once a large, large, large show in LA.
497392	500794	But, I mean, this is the largest regular show they do where it's literally thousands of people.
500854	505997	And honestly, at that point, 2,500, 6,800 looks all the same to me.
506057	508238	It's a shit ton of people all to be in one place.
508638	509399	That earns the Saturn bone.
525185	534072	I know, and I was worried that you were going to get that whole associated response thing with Reno, so that next time I said, hey, let's go to Reno, you'd just think about barfing, and you'd be like, no, I don't want to go.
534232	545421	Yeah, and I started to feel kind of fluish and crappy during the car ride up, and I'm like, all right, three-hour car ride, change in elevation, I just feel kind of icky, hit the buffet, and now my stomach was like, that was a bad plan.
545441	546702	That was your first mistake.
547102	547343	Yeah.
547503	551286	You didn't condition yourself with enough junk food beforehand, see.
552086	557630	You can't go to really anywhere in Nevada and not have a buffet at some point.
557690	558430	Unless you live there.
558730	560631	I'm sure we have plenty of listeners in Las Vegas.
560651	561372	In fact, I know we do.
561712	565975	That are probably listening to this going, I'm sick of fucking hearing about buffets.
566635	567375	They suck.
567395	567896	They're terrible.
568456	573562	They can shut up because they have Krispy Kreme, and Krispy Kreme is awesome, and I wish we still had it here.
573623	574744	Instead, it's going to be what?
575305	576506	What were they turning into?
576526	578068	A Chick-fil-A?
578709	580231	A Panera Bread.
581853	582774	Panera, screw it.
582994	585898	Put it back to being a Krispy Kreme again.
586178	587619	I didn't care less about Panera.
587659	590180	That building's been empty for like three years.
590281	592002	I mean, it's been a very long time.
592082	593422	It's longer than three years.
593542	594363	It's been very long.
594423	597005	Finally, they're putting a Panera bread in there, which I like Panera bread.
597025	597745	I think they're really good.
598045	598986	Good, healthy place to eat.
600447	602668	I don't like them because they're egg sandwiches.
603028	604629	They don't scramble their eggs.
604709	607331	They just kind of fry it and then you get like chunks of...
607811	609552	If it's egg salad, it shouldn't be.
610152	612173	Or did you just say egg or egg salad?
612313	614914	No, like they're breakfast sandwiches with eggs on them.
615434	618795	By the way, once in a while, we do stop talking about food and start talking about video games.
618815	620836	Just want you to know, it's not a Food Network podcast.
621136	621796	It's a game podcast.
621836	626858	It's just, it's very, if they had scrambled their eggs, it'd be an even distribution between the yolk and the white.
626878	631940	And the problem is, when you fry it like that, you get these big chunks of yolk and it doesn't taste very good.
631960	634701	Plus, they don't season anything and it's terrible.
636061	637442	Really wish it was a Krispy Kreme again.
639132	647020	Next time, if you really want, Loki, one of these nights, when I come back from the Bay Area, I'll have to do it when Jamie's not looking, because she'll be mad, but I'll sneak you some Krispy Kremes.
647600	648181	Awesome.
649101	650583	From the Bay Area, because they still have them there.
650683	651143	You know what?
651644	654166	I want one Krispy Kreme in particular.
654687	655087	Which one?
655207	656008	That's the...
659787	663770	As much as I like them, my favorite to this day is still the Eclair.
664551	665832	Because I do love the custard.
666152	668554	Well, I might have to think about doing that.
668654	669955	Is there one on the way home for me?
670136	670716	I think there is.
670876	672177	I don't think I have to go too far.
672257	674539	You should just take me to the Bay Area.
674619	676321	You should just take you?
676701	677361	Just take me there.
677381	678642	There's one near me in Daly City.
678763	681265	I don't know where you would stay for the night.
681285	682886	I mean, you can't sleep in the bed.
682906	683747	I'll walk the streets.
683827	684087	What?
685248	685508	Okay.
686109	687770	You're going to lonely roam the streets?
689029	691811	I'll be driving around singing Journey songs.
692472	695594	Actdeft in our chatroom says, it isn't OLR without Orange Lounge Foodio.
695634	696214	Don't you know it?
697095	699817	Monty Boggs says, I click off once they stop talking about food.
701298	703940	Jim Sally says, Krispy Kreme buffet would be heaven.
705205	705505	DarkSakura.com
722379	722960	It's dumb.
723000	727683	It's because they figured out that website, you know, this is whyyou'refat.com or something like that.
728023	730045	And people are like, oh, look, that's really bad for you.
730065	731586	Let's make a burger out of it or something.
731666	737230	And we get publication, you know, because people talk about it and how crazy it is and stuff like that.
737630	738370	It's ridiculous.
738450	740152	It's a trend that I wish would go away.
740752	747597	There was an episode of the Boondocks on Cartoon Network specifically about the grandpa opening up a soul food restaurant with the Luther.
748738	749098	Wow.
749839	750039	Huh.
751700	751800	Ah.
752145	752566	DarkSakura.com
769162	771663	Yeah, I tried to get Rob to order one.
771683	772703	He was like, no.
772843	777605	Even when he described it, I was like, oh, it was a deep fried ham and cheese sandwich?
777625	787008	It's thick sourdough toast with ham and Swiss, and then it's dipped in sort of a sweet batter, deep fried, and then served with strawberry jam and powdered sugar.
788529	790791	It's ham and cheese French toast with crap on it.
790911	792753	Well, see, there's a lot of things I don't like about that.
792773	796056	I don't like crap on my French toast other than, you know, maybe powdered sugar.
796296	798298	And I really don't like powdered sugar if I can get it without it.
799719	802142	I don't really care for jams and jellies and stuff like that.
802362	804844	And also, I hate Swiss.
806265	807306	He's quite a picky eater.
807386	808187	I am a picky eater.
808207	809909	Swiss is one of the lowest sodium cheeses.
810229	813432	And just also random, you know where I saw that on the menu?
813852	814412	Bennegan's.
814773	815993	Yes, there are still Bennegan's.
816894	820656	What they need to do is they need to take a burger, bread it in the pub.
820776	821416	Is that what it's called?
821596	823377	Crumbled bacon and then fry that.
824938	825478	I've seen it.
826478	827659	I've never been there.
828579	829960	Didn't we go at California Extreme?
829980	830841	No, we went to IHOP.
833206	833807	DarkSakura.com
851152	857674	Okay, this, I found, the company that I work at that I'm about to get laid off of, I found my boss's Facebook page.
858615	860075	My first boss, who hired me.
860595	864076	And I'm looking at his photos of him with... And he was Carol Channing?
864096	867397	You were hired by Carol Channing?
867417	868698	Do you like raspberries?
869318	870479	It's... It's... Hired!
870979	873521	But he's the world's biggest Anne Margaret fan.
874182	877364	And he also has met lots of... He's gone to her house.
878385	878525	Wow.
878545	880166	Got tons of photos, you know.
880747	888553	He and his partner have, you know, met, you know, her and her husband and gone to shows and sat in box seats.
889193	892056	But I'm also looking at his other photos of other celebrities that he's met.
892116	894718	And there's, like, him and Carol Channing and Bo Derek.
894858	895598	And that's pretty cool.
895698	898841	He's gonna be really sad in about ten years when all his favorite celebrities die.
900468	902980	Wish I had pictures with all the celebrities I've met.
904560	905000	DarkSakura.com
931798	932779	How was your gaming week?
933339	934180	Or two weeks, if you wish.
934220	935961	I really didn't play much of anything.
936001	937342	I played a little pinball.
938082	942025	And mostly I watched Dan scream at his Nintendo emulator.
943045	946347	Well, today I watched him yell at Rad Bracer.
947448	949189	But I wanted to hear the music in it.
949209	951391	The do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.
951411	956074	The one that was used in the Strong Bad anime one.
956955	961580	Anyway, and then Dan played some Turbo Outrun and Outrunners.
962721	964563	It was old school racing to hear it.
964943	965744	Fuck it and turn it off.
966965	972912	And I found my Ninja Pass, but I couldn't find my micro SD card.
973152	975775	I think those are pretty cheap to come by.
976181	978282	Yeah, I ordered one for five bucks.
978922	987584	But the whole reason I wanted it is because since I'm going back to the gym, my favorite thing to do is to go, well, back in the day it was go on the elliptical and play Pokemans.
988525	994126	So now it's going to be, I guess, play whatever game I happen to have on me.
994406	1000608	And I wanted to find some of those SNES ROM conversions for the DSi.
1000928	1001168	Nice.
1001989	1004812	And then I can play lots and lots of Seiken 3.
1004852	1008375	Because that's been the game I've really been wanting to get into playing.
1008395	1010237	Or just Final Fantasy 6, 3, whatever you want to call it.
1010257	1012799	But I have a new game that I'm going to be playing.
1012999	1013260	What's that?
1013280	1016002	Thank you to a lack of forgetfulness.
1016322	1019065	Finally, after like a month, I finally remember to bring Dark Sakura.
1019465	1020626	Final Fantasy 13.
1020706	1022108	Yeah, I really should finish that game.
1022208	1023549	I'll be playing the crap out of this.
1024210	1025411	And I start school next week, too.
1026055	1026535	Good times.
1026655	1027335	You're going to be busy.
1027435	1031257	And Tuesday is old school DDR night at our Vigil.
1031597	1031877	Yes.
1032357	1034438	I'm going to go.
1034858	1039419	I don't know if I'll actually play Ditter, but I'll definitely play some 2DX.
1039619	1043620	And if they ever fix their freaking Technica machine, I'll play that too.
1043640	1044721	I'm going to play DDR.
1045161	1045401	Alright.
1048775	1050256	Maybe I'll play one round of DDR.
1050996	1051796	That would be fun.
1052217	1054958	I haven't done that in forever, but I'm almost afraid to try again.
1055458	1060180	Just because last night... It's because I still think... It's humbling.
1060400	1063942	You're going to have to go down to five footers to get yourself back into it.
1064002	1067663	I've been playing sixes and sevens, and it's been fine for me.
1090590	1091651	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1112614	1113375	DanSansRevolution Preview Party
1130011	1130672	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
1155170	1156631	Dvrx said Dave and Buster's in town.
1176960	1177721	I had to laugh.
1178341	1185446	Oh, I'm sorry to interrupt because you mentioned Mel B. I had to laugh because I've been seeing this on my release list and I finally found the box art for it.
1185466	1189088	They have a game coming out in the week called Get Fit with Mel B.
1191315	1195478	I'm the runner up on Dancing with the Stars, but some asshole on the internet doesn't know who I am.
1210598	1213440	At any rate, Dan and I are having our fifth wedding anniversary.
1213841	1214761	Oh.
1215142	1224189	And we were going to get folks together on the day before because we can't do the $40 free play thing all day thing on our actual anniversary.
1225130	1230754	So we were going to go and hit up Dave and Buster's and have like a big party with whoever wants to show up.
1231455	1231955	What day is this?
1232255	1232515	The 31st.
1232816	1233196	August 31st.
1237279	1239641	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1257470	1261991	and then you are officially one of the chosen people at that point, right?
1262011	1263652	Yes, I'm officially one of the chosen people.
1263852	1265112	Congrats in advance.
1265552	1265832	All right.
1266512	1269873	Well, somehow we completely deviated from the talk of video games.
1270954	1271874	What did we hit on in there?
1272514	1274295	Jews, Spice Girls?
1275275	1275715	No, but anyway.
1276355	1277335	Alright, Loki!
1278276	1279596	I haven't been playing a whole lot.
1280197	1281297	You got a good excuse.
1281957	1285199	I'm trying to think back to what I played at the hospital on the DS.
1285219	1288160	I don't even know if I played anything on the DS.
1289020	1293842	I played a little bit more of Spirit Tracks.
1294562	1296283	That game's okay.
1296983	1300805	Some of the Zelda games on the DS, I just don't go through them very quickly, but...
1301585	1302726	It's alright.
1303707	1311293	Then mainly the only thing I've been playing since I got back to work has been the Grand Theft Auto Lost and Damned.
1311354	1322503	Yes, we've gone back to Lost and Damned now because they were kind of craving the open world Grand Theft Auto deathmatch things and since you can't really do that in the Battle of the Gate Tony...
1323604	1324665	We're playing Lost in Damage.
1324685	1325965	It's actually a little bit more fun.
1326006	1331229	It's a little less serious because I'm not really trying to get up on the leaderboards for that.
1332329	1337933	I kind of want to go back to the Battle of Gay Tony so I can actually get to the top of the leaderboards because I kind of stopped at rank 59.
1341895	1359458	But then on top of all that, I've been working still on working on my mods and stuff for Grand Theft Auto because I have a really big one in the works right now that's going to be completely stuff that's never been done before on the console version.
1361620	1374471	and thankfully I upgraded my computer to Windows 7 64-bit and added another 4 gigs of RAM so now it runs smoothly and I can actually run Grand Theft Auto without having it crash after 5 minutes.
1375071	1382858	There was something weird with the installation or something on XP so now it's really stable which is great and I can actually work on it.
1383318	1384760	Lots of baby jokes in the chat room.
1384940	1387462	Spazinator wants to know if you've been playing Babymaker Extreme.
1388443	1388603	Nope.
1388963	1392467	Frisbee says, Loki has been playing lots of Imagine Babies.
1394290	1395231	Uh, no.
1395811	1398935	It's just, uh... Just been playing reality babies.
1398955	1401198	Just been playing washing the bottles.
1402399	1404021	Changing the diapers.
1404061	1404782	Good times.
1405122	1405883	Fun stuff like that.
1405943	1407585	No, really, it's because now...
1409307	1412209	with the sleep schedule and everything, and we have to get up a lot of times.
1412870	1418013	You know, I kind of have to stick to the old person schedule where, you know, I have to go to bed at 9 o'clock at night.
1418033	1418773	Yeah.
1419154	1420995	Well, it's been 11, okay?
1421775	1423557	11 o'clock at night is really what we've been sticking to.
1424157	1432603	But sometimes 9 o'clock at night or 10, between 9 and 11, because I have to get up in the morning, like at 5 in the morning, you know, with the babies.
1432683	1432903	So...
1434844	1435344	Outro Outro Outro Outro
1464167	1468194	I don't think anyone's surprised that you haven't been able to play a whole lot lately.
1468214	1471440	We'll get into things I shouldn't be playing a little bit later.
1474761	1478182	Yeah, just lots of stuff to be doing.
1478242	1482063	But I've been mainly just working on the Grand Theft Auto stuff because that's what I play at work.
1482223	1486184	And it's going to be so fun once we get all the mod things done.
1487644	1490125	DarkSakura, you missed something you want to talk about in your week?
1490445	1491625	I played Star Trek Online.
1491805	1492745	Of course, you always do.
1492785	1493806	Anything exciting going on there?
1493846	1494446	Dabo!
1494866	1495706	The implemented Dabo.
1495826	1497567	So you can gamble for Latinum.
1499267	1502208	And they have HoloLita and they got Chase Masterton to do her voice.
1502528	1502728	Wow.
1502908	1503028	So...
1504550	1524869	I played the Castlevania Harmony of Schadenfreude or whatever the 360 version is No, I'm joking about the name The multiplayer one I played the demo of that Didn't like it Don't know why
1526104	1530968	Playing as Alucard, upscaled HD graphics, Castlevania, gave it two rounds.
1531888	1532509	It's weird.
1532549	1533309	Wasn't feeling it.
1533450	1534170	It's weird.
1534250	1536472	It doesn't feel like other Castlevania games.
1536512	1541916	And I think, I hear that that game really shines on its best when it's multiplayer, which, you know, no big surprise there.
1541936	1543437	Most games are better when it's multiplayer.
1543497	1547240	But yeah, playing it normal is really strange.
1547340	1553665	Like the whole, especially the way the whole map's zoomed out in the beginning is just kind of a weird, weird feeling.
1553685	1553825	Yeah.
1554622	1555722	and some Puzzle Quest 2.
1555822	1556642	Still working on that.
1558423	1566424	Can only play that for maybe 30-45 minutes at a time because when you get to the lower levels, I'm almost at the max level.
1566464	1567844	I'm level 43 out of 50.
1568664	1571445	You have to play so much freaking Bejeweled just to clear a room.
1571585	1572705	It kind of becomes a grind.
1573645	1575246	And of course, World of Warcraft.
1575926	1577986	Got some accomplishments done in that.
1578626	1580927	What are your biggest accomplishments in World of Warcraft so far?
1580947	1582347	50 mounts.
1585363	1594813	and I finally grinded all five cities in Argent Tournament so I got my super hella exalted Argent champion with cheesecake achievement.
1596095	1598057	Did Blizzard actually mail you a cheesecake?
1598197	1598698	I hope so.
1599238	1601381	Because all those dailies, never again.
1601501	1602241	I wanted to die.
1602261	1602382	Man!
1603703	1604524	Thank you for watching!
1622194	1641902	that would be a great idea for an MMO but you know there'd be people that would exploit the hell out of that so they'd have to think of funny ways to put caps on it but it's kind of like one of those loyalty programs like what Square Enix sends out what like iPhones or no iPod Touches or whatever if you're like a uber platinum bought every game we ever put out member or whatever but yeah anyhow
1642162	1646345	And our guild is now 6-12 of ICC.
1646525	1646685	Yes.
1646986	1648126	Same guild I'm in, of course.
1648247	1652450	We got down Rotface and... Festergut.
1652490	1652990	Festergut.
1653010	1656693	And we're working on Valthyria, Dreamwalker, Healy, Dragon.
1656733	1658474	Which probably was not the best idea for the next boss fight.
1658494	1659555	Which I don't like that fight at all.
1659695	1659995	But yeah.
1660015	1660936	So, I don't know.
1660956	1663938	We're going back in tomorrow, so maybe we'll do the Blood Princes.
1664278	1664799	Was that what it is?
1664819	1665439	The Blood Queen?
1665459	1665799	The Princes?
1665819	1666420	Whatever they're called?
1666440	1667841	Princes and then Queen is after them.
1667881	1668781	Yeah, we gotta do that whole thing.
1669002	1669202	Anyway.
1669842	1670423	Wow, wow, wow.
1671125	1672407	I've been playing a lot of WoW too, of course.
1672988	1674330	All the same things he's been talking about.
1674350	1677396	Well, actually, no, because my accomplishments, I don't have nearly the same stuff.
1677456	1679439	I haven't done the Uber stuff.
1679500	1679720	I have...
1681508	1704479	Alan's really good at focusing on one character, and I've got, I've started to develop, you know, as the wait continues on for Cataclysm, Altaholism, and, you know, I've been leveling a Shaman, which has been fun, and I've been slowly working on my Warrior, who has lulled at, like, 76 for the past, like, four months, she's up to, like, 78 now, so I'll probably get her over the hill to 80 at some point, then I'll have another 80, woo!
1706481	1709683	Outside of that though, another Blizzard game I've been playing a lot of.
1709943	1715766	I finally played StarCraft 2, which is old news to a lot of you guys.
1716006	1720649	Those of you that are huge fans of StarCraft bought this game the day it came out, I'm sure.
1721009	1724631	But you might remember I was very apprehensive about getting into StarCraft because...
1725091	1725932	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1747515	1748396	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1763797	1765058	Thank you for watching!
1782911	1786535	Multiplayer, not so noob friendly.
1786835	1788837	They've done some things.
1788857	1791460	There's this whole practice league you can do for a little while.
1791800	1793381	You can slow down the game a lot.
1793622	1796625	There are some things they've done to help it be a little bit easier.
1797486	1800829	At the end of the day, when you try to play a human opponent, it's tough.
1801449	1828610	and uh playing though against like the computer AI depending on how you do it is is is cool um like you know a friend of mine from the WoW Guild and I were playing online the other night and we were playing two versus two but we would slow down the game and we played very easy computer and it was almost too easy like we whooped it like three times so we said let's step it up to easy and still we were able to conquer it you know a little more difficult but not not too bad so but then we played
1829471	1830671	Thank you for watching!
1854276	1856017	And I know the speed thing will come with time.
1857337	1859218	Yeah, so multiplayer's been a very interesting experience.
1859238	1860958	But campaign's really cool.
1861058	1867801	Very animated, very cool little decks that you go through on the ship to kind of... Well, you don't start there.
1867841	1869461	You actually start in a different area.
1869481	1873963	But you move on to the ship, and you can kind of buy enhancements and things, which are really cool.
1874863	1876004	So I like what they did there.
1876604	1879505	Here's where things get weird, I think, with StarCraft, is that...
1880325	1881186	StarCraft Games StarCraft Games
1906621	1912126	But my question is, in the next game, okay, there's going to be a Zerg campaign.
1912346	1913047	All right, I get that.
1913087	1922096	That'll be cool because I'll actually get to learn how to play Zerg because that's the other problem I have with multiplayer right now is that being that I am new to StarCraft, I didn't really get into the first game.
1923637	1926219	I don't know what I'm doing when I play Zerg or Protoss.
1926259	1928582	I mean, yeah, I know they have a lot of the similar stuff, but I don't...
1929022	1929523	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1944259	1945100	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1963530	1967337	Probably a little early for me to be saying something like that because I haven't played the second game.
1967798	1972166	But I just kind of look at it and go, what are they going to add that's going to make it worth all that money?
1972186	1973649	Because I don't see that changing a whole lot.
1976813	1992452	I think I recall the Blizzard developers saying last year that when they announced that they were doing three separate releases, that the campaigns, the story modes for each game is going to be anywhere from 25 to 40 hours, whatever is considered a full game length.
1992872	1996577	Because in StarCraft 1, all three campaigns together made up the game.
1997097	1997557	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2018044	2018784	I'm not going to be pleased.
2018844	2029968	If you don't care about lore, really, and you're just in it for the multiplayer and the maps, 30 hours of campaign, even if it's like, ooh, let's go into the heart of the politics of the Zerg, it's like, yeah, I don't care.
2030088	2033470	That's 30 hours I could be working on my ranking in League mode, right?
2033510	2034070	Yeah, yeah.
2034970	2037092	So it's going to be very interesting to see how they justify it.
2037152	2038113	I think it's going to be tough.
2038613	2041896	But, you know, I don't know, Blizzard, clearly they know what they're doing.
2041936	2049363	They have much success on the PC, and I'm really excited for Diablo 3, and obviously the new WoW expansion.
2050624	2054408	But at this point, I kind of look at it and go, I don't know if this was the best decision.
2055489	2058131	I mean, from a money-making perspective, it was, but...
2058471	2058951	They might do $60, $45, $45.
2061713	2064495	They might take it down a notch on the prize for the latter two.
2064736	2067417	I wonder if they're going to do the other two as expansions to the first one.
2067618	2068738	So you have to buy the first game.
2070580	2071480	Oh, wow.
2072761	2074262	That would be, I could see that.
2074362	2079086	If the second and third games were just expansions to the first game, that I get.
2079126	2080627	But that's not the way Blizzard's talking.
2081888	2082468	So I don't know.
2083208	2087210	All right, anyhow, we're going to get into some gaming news here now that we're done with our gaming week.
2087230	2088371	But first, some housekeeping.
2088731	2090752	Not a whole lot of housekeeping I want to share tonight, actually.
2090772	2093354	Just, you know, please join our Facebook if you haven't already.
2093714	2096876	Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio is where our Facebook can be found.
2097336	2099338	We're also on Twitter at Twitter.com slash OLR.
2099358	2103000	We're going to be taking your Twitter topics later on, so if you want to send us some of those, that would be great.
2103600	2108043	And, of course, you can always email us at Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
2108063	2110124	We'll get to reading your emails a little later in the show.
2110544	2128711	otherwise um not a lot of uh show no i mean we had last week off i don't see us having another show off until probably i know halloween is on a sunday this year right so there probably is not gonna be a message about that you did but i think it was when i was really intoxicated in reno that's something to discuss later
2129440	2133381	Yes, how I drank so much in Reno that I actually fell out of the bed.
2133622	2139564	Oh, no, I meant Halloween, but... Oh, I just made that up.
2139764	2140784	It's really funny, huh?
2140944	2142865	Rob fell out of the bed.
2142885	2144145	All right.
2144425	2145406	Yeah, we'll talk Halloween later.
2145646	2147266	But otherwise, we're set for a little while.
2147566	2147867	All right.
2148687	2152588	Or I don't know about Labor Day weekend because that's going to be tough because three-day weekend.
2153188	2153529	We'll see.
2154249	2154709	Drunk show?
2156363	2158445	That might be an idea, actually.
2158705	2160907	We haven't done that in a long, long time.
2160987	2161648	No, we haven't.
2161748	2163770	I doubt Loki would be participating in that.
2163790	2164951	Yeah, I don't think I could.
2165211	2166432	Does Dan drink at all?
2166652	2167393	Can Dan drink?
2168174	2169255	He's not big on it.
2169495	2170536	You know what we should do?
2172523	2174805	We should do the marathon episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
2175686	2176046	Yes.
2176087	2179610	Because there's nothing on on All Games Radio after us.
2180231	2183294	And we should just honestly see and I don't know how the listeners will feel about this.
2183654	2185496	We should honestly just see We do the regular show.
2185796	2190741	Do the regular show and then just go as long as we possibly can.
2191604	2191644	P.S.
2207415	2209336	Even then, I don't think we'd hit it in just 24 hours.
2209376	2210937	We'd have to go take some serious time.
2210977	2214078	We'll add Gaming Podcast in front of that.
2214958	2218500	The longest episode of the official gaming podcast of the universe.
2219000	2219921	I'm looking at the chat room.
2220361	2228244	Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com Breakman in our chat room, just for the record, says, Falling out of the bed is way better than falling off the toilet.
2229225	2230065	Haven't done that.
2230966	2231387	Let's see.
2232267	2233828	The chatroom says, ooh, drunk show.
2233968	2236570	And of course, as always, we would drink responsibly.
2236790	2239431	If we do have a drunk show, then somebody else is going to have to drive me here.
2239451	2243634	I don't know how I'll do that, or I'll have to sleep on the vault floor like Jamie's other houseguests do.
2244814	2245475	We'll figure that out.
2245855	2248297	TigerClaw says, so it'll be like an afterbirth XXL.
2248337	2249137	Yeah, something like that.
2251358	2254220	SSJ100Matt says we should invite Irene and Extifer for this.
2254520	2257042	We definitely should try to get other people here if we do that.
2257722	2287251	so we may maybe I'm on to something because we don't I don't have any I'm not going out of town for Labor Day I usually do but I'm not this year that's actually in two weeks I don't have a lot of time I plan on sitting on my ass so maybe I don't know are you available to come up here we need to figure something out I was gonna say if you're staying at home for Labor Day weekend I'm coming up here then so maybe we'll do that and you know I was thinking about going down there but if people feel like crashing so we can sleep in cycles we've got the futon mattresses in the vault I can make it into a bed a comfortable little bed
2288511	2289992	We have comfortable couches.
2290873	2291613	We'll figure something out.
2291853	2292774	That's in two weeks though.
2292814	2294554	I just realized like, oh crap, that's in two weeks.
2294594	2298116	So next week we'll have an answer on what's going to happen in two weeks.
2298656	2298896	All right.
2299737	2302278	In the meantime, how about some actual bonafide gaming news?
2302398	2305159	Loki, I know you've missed the gaming news, right?
2305480	2306000	How are you doing?
2306520	2307901	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2331013	2333314	I don't understand in the back how that's really going to work.
2333714	2336915	It seems a little awkward to me, but I guess we'll see.
2339396	2343857	And apparently this is coming from an unnamed source, according to Eurogamer.
2344658	2344818	And...
2347182	2348523	They were super flimsy.
2348623	2348763	Yeah.
2374315	2374575	Yeah.
2375155	2375816	Guess what, Sony?
2375836	2378577	Apparently people do like to buy physical copies of their games.
2379837	2380437	Who would have thought?
2382838	2384439	So, I don't know.
2384459	2388060	It would be interesting to see if this really does anything.
2388680	2392742	I think they really should just stick with putting at least a second analog stick on there.
2393302	2399925	Because the actual PSP phone thing had this touch panel that kind of replaced the analog sticks.
2400425	2402325	And you could kind of use it like the analog sticks.
2402345	2403266	It was almost like a strip.
2405474	2407966	which is an interesting idea I guess but
2409716	2410056	I don't know.
2410637	2415600	Hopefully the system will do a lot better than the last PSP.
2416200	2418001	Oh, well, the PSP Go did terribly, yes.
2418042	2420063	You're not talking about the original PSP.
2420083	2421264	I'm talking about the original PSP.
2421324	2422604	It's not done well recently.
2422624	2427468	Well, compared to the DS, but it's done better than a lot of systems do, I would think.
2427668	2430189	What other systems are we talking about out there?
2430209	2438555	The Lynx, the Game Gear, the Gamescom, the... What was that shitty little thing they showed off at E3 a few years ago that was a portable device?
2438775	2439416	The Gizmodo?
2439576	2441918	The Gizmodo, the N-Gage.
2442118	2443199	It's been better than all of those.
2444400	2446442	I like the little guitar game on the Gizmodo, though.
2447223	2447863	Barely, though.
2447883	2448884	Gizmondo, that was it.
2449485	2449685	That's it.
2449705	2450106	Gizmondo.
2450786	2452768	Oh, Gizmodo's a gaming blog.
2452868	2454009	Or something like that.
2454630	2455190	Gizmondo, yes.
2455210	2456451	It's a dumb name for a device anyway.
2456471	2457512	It's like Gizmondo.
2457653	2457953	Uh-huh.
2458493	2458794	Whatever.
2459114	2460715	But yeah, it's just... I don't know.
2460815	2462117	I don't see them doing too much...
2463815	2465596	Stuff that's very different than the last PSP.
2466037	2468999	I think that the system's okay.
2469039	2472702	They just have to make a few enhancements to it and hopefully they'll learn from their mistakes.
2475164	2479487	And I hope for their sake that it's a little more secure as far as cracking it goes.
2480563	2484104	Now, wait, what adds value to these rumors?
2484124	2486645	Because rumors can, you know, kind of come from anywhere.
2486685	2489645	Like, I could say, oh, the next PSP is going to double as a cigarette lighter.
2489685	2490025	Woo-hoo!
2490405	2491086	You know, there you go.
2491546	2494686	But, you know, cut, print, run with it.
2494747	2495987	PSP to have cigarette lighter.
2496567	2499348	But what adds this any value, what they're saying here?
2500568	2500648	Um...
2502705	2504206	Honestly, don't know.
2504686	2507107	So, I guess we don't really know.
2507147	2512509	I mean, for all we know, this could be some sort of analyst talking about the system.
2512869	2513310	I don't know.
2513330	2516511	Let's see here.
2516871	2522874	It's according to three separate development sources that have seen the new PSP.
2524825	2550418	and they're saying that it's gonna have a touch sensitive area on the back of the unit behind the screen which is weird if you think about it I mean that's just awkward I mean if I'm gonna control a game and the touch screen's on the back unless it like flips over or something so you can do like touch screen type games like the DS or something but I don't know
2550799	2556361	Going to our chatroom at chat.orangelandre.com, Odd1 says, I hope they keep the online functionality of the device.
2556441	2558182	Podcasting, decent web browsing.
2558642	2560023	Shit was kind of cash, you know?
2560203	2561283	And SD cards, yeah.
2561884	2563184	I kind of agree.
2563244	2567906	PSP's biggest strength wasn't necessarily the games that were on it, but the fact it was kind of an all-in-one type of thing.
2568046	2571568	I mean, minus the phone, but you don't need a phone there.
2571768	2573689	They had their advantage definitely there, but...
2574289	2575510	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2594452	2595093	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2615095	2637598	and that's about it that's all you really need to do as far as controls go because the control system you know scheme is pretty much the same thing that's on the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360 and it works well you don't need to add some touch screens to it hell if you want to make the screen a touch screen or something that's fine you know so you can type and stuff a lot easier than you know the phone dialing type thing that they had going with it
2639599	2657064	that would be fine if you just make the screen a touch screen for that kind of stuff because people dig that and if you want the control scheme for different casual games that would be fine but I don't think they really need to reinvent the controls for the system itself it's pretty good
2658758	2659979	Alright, well we'll see what happens.
2660019	2664043	I would imagine if there is going to be a new PSP, probably not going to hear anything about it until next year's E3.
2664063	2667286	They're saying it's expected to launch at the end of 2011.
2667326	2671489	Makes sense because you have the 3DS coming out in the beginning of 2011.
2671549	2674012	We'll see what happens.
2674232	2676093	Maybe it'll do 3D on top of all that.
2676634	2676914	Doubt it.
2677074	2677315	We'll see.
2678075	2696590	Alright, by the way, before I get into my next story, I do want to bring this up, because somebody in chat had actually talked about, let's see, it was a little while ago here, but talking about the gaming marathon, or the marathon we were talking about doing over Labor Day weekend, TigerClaw in our chatroom says, seems like a good idea for those of us in the West Coast, or for those in the West Coast, but for the East Coast, it would be enormously late for us.
2698452	2705778	I actually got a message right after that from Bobby Blackwolf, who does the show before us, telling us he's actually going to be out Labor Day weekend.
2706298	2717968	so that means there's going to be no programming on All Games Radio at all on Sunday because DragonCon is that same weekend and PAX so we'd only be going up against PAX and DragonCon just that?
2719309	2730639	I think there's a lot of people listening to our show though that aren't able to afford to fly out to Seattle or Atlanta so I'm sure there'll be an audience for it if we want to do it so we'll see we'll have to see what happens
2732196	2732716	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2752683	2759546	Except it's Goldeneye with Daniel Craig, which is a little weird, but it is still somewhat of the same game that you should know of before.
2760026	2767029	Well, what's pretty cool is that when the game comes out, they're going to be releasing a bundle that actually comes with a classic controller.
2767569	2773391	So if you want to spend $70, or $69.99 to be exact... It's actually a classic controller pro, by the way.
2773811	2776132	Oh, that's right, because they have the... What's the difference?
2776192	2778013	A classic controller pro... It's got the little grippies on it.
2778113	2780374	Yeah, there's a little bit of extra stuff.
2780834	2783536	But also, not just the fact that it's pro, but it's gold.
2784017	2784317	Get it?
2784557	2785098	Golden eye?
2785658	2786019	Gold?
2786279	2786959	Golden Wii.
2787119	2787380	Ha!
2787760	2788641	Wii is golden.
2789982	2790702	Golden Wii.
2790803	2794646	So if you want to get a golden controller... Well, there isn't actually a golden Wii.
2794766	2798709	Just a golden classic controller pro for your white Wii or your black Wii.
2798769	2800691	Does it tell you to drink more water if you buy it?
2801371	2802152	I don't... Sorry.
2802512	2802973	Don't lick it.
2803273	2803513	Alright.
2804214	2805095	Don't lick the golden Wii.
2808069	2814498	No release date announced outside the United States, so if you're in another country, you may not be getting this at all, but you know what?
2815339	2817642	Usually it's the other countries that get all those games.
2818664	2823611	Not the games, the different colors and things for their systems before we do, so you can wait on this one.
2824110	2824870	I don't know, it sounds cool.
2824890	2826270	I already have a classic controller.
2826290	2830951	I mean, I might not be pro with grippy things, but I don't think I need a second one.
2831191	2836132	Heck, my Wii still isn't even hooked up, although, shit, Metroid's out.
2837172	2837672	Today?
2837692	2839213	Was it today or next week?
2839233	2839753	It's next week.
2839973	2841113	Well, actually, no, I take it back.
2841193	2841813	It's not next week.
2841833	2842673	It's the week after next.
2843494	2844474	Or wait, no, it is next week.
2844514	2845314	It has to be next week.
2845334	2846334	It was last week, August.
2846954	2847614	I keep forgetting.
2847634	2851555	The intro to that, the little trailer that was up is gorgeous.
2853126	2856328	It looks awesome Hope that Oddjob isn't so much of a cheap bitch
2880505	2883486	I actually played as Oddjob, and he was an awesomely cheap bitch.
2883827	2886408	Awesome.
2886728	2894171	Dan and I watched this video that's like the top ten dick moves to pull in a game, and one of them is playing Oddjob in Deathmatch and Goldeneye.
2894831	2897112	Okay, now, I don't remember why.
2897392	2898412	Why is he a cheap bitch?
2898793	2899493	Because he's short.
2901525	2904126	It's like when he's right up on you, you can't shoot him.
2904326	2905627	You have to aim low to shoot.
2905867	2907768	But the hat toss thing is the best thing ever.
2908548	2909109	It really is.
2909129	2910429	There's a shoe, honestly.
2911370	2912630	Can I interject something real quick?
2912750	2913151	Absolutely.
2913551	2923796	When we were in Reno at the hotel, I noticed that the direct-to-your-room streaming for video games is N64 games, which is just so backwards and weird to me.
2923836	2924336	I don't know why.
2925066	2926788	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2945805	2947546	So like too many people can't play it at once?
2947626	2951329	Since I'm on eBay right now, they do sell those systems sometimes.
2952650	2959576	I don't remember what they're called, but they're really expensive and they have like a bunch of different 64 games in there that they can stream.
2964195	2972263	Just while Loki's looking at that, in our chatroom at chat.orange.com, some of the chatters are talking about Netflix on the Wii and a lot of folks using the Wii for Netflix.
2972283	2974105	Isn't that the LodgeNet Nintendo 64?
2974585	2974905	Yes.
2974965	2975606	Yeah, that's it.
2975806	2976107	Wow.
2977328	2983694	That the Wii is a good bedroom gaming console and that a lot of people can get Netflix in their bedroom with that.
2984214	2985336	You do need a disc for that.
2985356	2988699	There's no Netflix channel at this time, but some folks kind of talking about that.
2989539	2993642	Looking at a comment from Odd1 in chat asking, does Goldeneye have online play?
2994143	2995343	I believe it does.
2995504	2998486	I believe the new one on the Wii will have online play, but no voice chat.
2999166	3001928	You just have to double opt in with your 45 digit friend code.
3001968	3002468	Pretty much.
3003149	3004330	Kind of what you're used to in the games.
3004570	3005010	Yeah, I love that.
3005190	3008913	No voice chat, despite the fact we made this accessory that we don't really use at all.
3010180	3010761	Go Nintendo.
3011641	3011961	Awesome.
3013803	3016705	Alright, so going on, DarkSakura, what do you got for us?
3016725	3018766	Well, you know what's better than a Nintendo 64?
3020247	3021468	Lots of things, actually.
3021888	3025310	Peanut Butter's better than a Nintendo 64.
3025831	3028152	Mario Kart 64 was fucking awesome.
3028192	3028753	Dreamcast!
3028773	3030153	Peanut Butter is awesome.
3030173	3031534	Dreamcast is pretty awesome.
3032055	3032535	Guess what?
3032575	3033976	They're still making games.
3034156	3036758	I had these coconut M&M's today that were delicious.
3036898	3037859	I had mocha M&M's.
3037959	3039720	They were actually better than a Dreamcast.
3040080	3041781	I have Mocha M&M's and they're pretty damn good.
3042301	3045864	I mean, you can't lick a Dreamcast, but... Well, you could, but it wouldn't be very tasty.
3046444	3047224	Avoid the warranty on that.
3047244	3048325	Unless you're Jessica Chopin.
3049746	3050046	Anyway.
3050066	3051387	Is that who licks the PSP?
3051407	3058831	Red Spot Games, you know, they put out The Last Hope and Wind and Water Puzzle Battles and Rush Rush Rally Racing.
3059852	3062053	They're doing more Dreamcast games.
3062153	3068217	They want to do more and more and they're actually trying to see if companies will release their games on the Dreamcast.
3069017	3084106	so they've got another release planned for next year but to supplement any losses they've actually to supplement their costs they're actually reproducing games for WiiWare and Xbox Live Arcade too
3084386	3090408	Yeah, I was going to say they should talk to Sega since they're going to be doing those Dreamcast games on live already.
3090428	3091388	Yeah, when?
3092948	3093248	Soon.
3093288	3094249	Oh, that's right.
3094269	3096609	They did have Crazy Tax 83, so it's happening.
3096629	3103671	Well, and the guy behind it, he totally wants Sega to start producing for the Dreamcast again, which I kind of think isn't going to happen.
3105051	3106372	What could possibly make you think that?
3107992	3110733	Maybe because they've said themselves the Dreamcast is over.
3110753	3111433	Yeah.
3113032	3115494	Also, yeah, who's going to produce new Dreamcast hardware?
3115834	3122680	How long is it before the patents are up on those things and then all the, you know, Korean and Chinese knockoff systems can come out like the Nintendos?
3123580	3133668	The patents are up on the old school Nintendos and you see all these new Nintendos coming out that are, you know, they don't have the blow on the cartridge problem or any of that stuff.
3133708	3135309	I mean, it's all kind of different now.
3135630	3137431	I want the Famicom Disk System personally.
3138208	3140610	I think there's one out there that plays NES and Genesis games.
3140790	3141530	I want to say I saw.
3141550	3144092	I have something that'll do that.
3144693	3146354	I have an NES and I have a Genesis.
3146394	3147595	They have a Genesis one.
3147615	3148615	And I have a PC.
3148795	3150377	The portable Genesis one.
3150897	3152498	They have, of course, a portable Nintendo one.
3152518	3153579	I have a portable Genesis.
3153639	3154319	It's called a Nomad.
3154339	3155640	I want to say it's about 20 years.
3155700	3159003	Because I have a feeling the Super Nintendo one's going to lapse really soon.
3159363	3160043	It already has.
3160083	3161584	They have Super Nintendo systems out there.
3161645	3162305	Do they really?
3162385	3162605	Yeah.
3163266	3163486	Wow.
3164106	3168350	Hurry up and give me my new duo LTs and I'll be happy.
3169390	3182601	But it would be interesting, I mean, not to deviate too much from the topic at hand, but even if Sega didn't want to do the Dreamcast themselves, license, you know, before the patent lapses, if they're just going to sit on it, let someone else develop a Dreamcast.
3182621	3185062	I honestly think the Dreamcast games are still pretty solid.
3185082	3186183	You're cut out for some reason.
3186243	3186484	Okay.
3187084	3189146	I think the Dreamcast games are still pretty solid.
3190006	3192428	I mean, I've gone back and wanted to play stuff up.
3192448	3193609	I was talking to Dan today about
3196004	3197905	because, well, you know, I'm still kind of hot.
3198065	3198986	I think you're cut out again.
3199046	3200307	I'm holding the thing in.
3200687	3202309	I'm telling you, we're not hearing you.
3202909	3207213	Well, I'm still wanting to play Sonic Colors when it comes out.
3207473	3209234	So I've been like, let's play Sonic Adventure.
3210275	3210515	So.
3212517	3212817	All right.
3213538	3216840	Well, we'll see how successful this venture is.
3217120	3221464	It was also really easy to pirate Dreamcast games, so we'll have to see how successful this venture is.
3222096	3225237	And hey, even if you couldn't get the game to burn right, you'd always get a great soundtrack.
3225757	3225958	True.
3226378	3230219	And those games that that company's putting out, they are out there.
3231120	3232840	For piracy reasons.
3232860	3233761	Why am I not surprised?
3235401	3238683	I just run them on my cabinet at home because I have a Dreamcast simulator on there.
3238823	3241844	So, you know, Fresh Rush Rally or whatever is pretty awesome.
3241884	3243144	And I don't know where to buy that game.
3244105	3244885	Not that I would anyways.
3244965	3245765	It's like 40 bucks.
3246406	3247506	40 bucks for a Dreamcast game?
3248106	3248667	Nowadays?
3249307	3249407	No.
3251181	3253843	Anyhow, so it's kind of funny.
3254583	3269392	Apparently, Microsoft got this great idea, excellent idea, that they're going to digitally distribute review copies of Halo Reach to the press or press people or whomever they have that they're distributing this to.
3270292	3291866	and it's available in a games on demand format through live in fact some people found it actually on the marketplace for 99,999 Microsoft points which is just you know it's just that's not showing up at the console right that's some website trick actually showing it showing up on the website
3292706	3318359	and you know obviously even if you did have the $1,250 to purchase the game it would let you purchase the game unfortunately though even though it did come up on there someone found a way to download it and then people found a way to crack it and now it's leaked out there thanks to Microsoft
3319039	3320479	GameTutorial.com GameTutorial.com GameTutorial.com
3334964	3339846	They originally downloaded it and then they're like, ha ha, we have it, we're not going to share it with anybody.
3340166	3349388	And somehow their copy leaked out to somebody else that was less scrupulous than they were and sent it out to the community and everybody figured out how to crack it immediately.
3349788	3351469	That website got it legitimately?
3351889	3359031	No, they found a way to hack the live server or whatever to download it without actually having to have the code and stuff.
3359971	3362372	So they did that and...
3364966	3368608	Yeah, so it's not too good for Microsoft.
3368628	3374310	And of course, they're investigating how people are able to get this.
3374750	3376371	Once it's on the internet, it's out there.
3376451	3379272	That's a really bad one to lose, too.
3379333	3384175	I mean, I'm surprised that they didn't test this on not so much of a AAA title.
3385555	3388477	They did it with Crackdown 2, apparently.
3389417	3390298	It's on there like that.
3390738	3396461	But it didn't matter with Crackdown 2, because that got leaked out a week or two before it was actually released.
3396881	3401404	This has been leaked out, what, three weeks before it comes out?
3402264	3410929	And the format that they've broken down to now, because Games on Demand packages are basically how you install a game onto your hard drive or something like that.
3410949	3411609	It's that format.
3411869	3437997	or if you download it from their service it's the same format but you're just downloading it and it's signed to your console but consoles out there that are hacked with JTAG basically they can run pretty much anything and there's a program out there to convert the games on demand packages to ISO or like a disk format and then you just dump all the files on there so that's what they basically did after they cracked the file that was on there.
3438277	3439218	It's interesting.
3439379	3439699	Go ahead.
3440159	3440320	Sorry.
3440600	3444344	Monty Boggs in our chatroom at chat.org.com says Bungie will ban Hammer.
3444865	3446287	Actually, kind of an interesting point.
3446347	3453856	I mean, because this is all being done digitally and these copies are signed, isn't there a way that Microsoft could ban Hammer all the consoles that have this?
3454156	3468552	Well, yes and no, because yes, they could ban them if they were dumb enough to take them online, but these copies that are out there right now are used on JTAG systems, which are not used for online play.
3468872	3473177	JTAG systems would get banned anyways if you connected live after about four hours or so.
3473677	3475039	You would get your console banned.
3475779	3504751	um so these systems are just meant for playing so what they're doing now is to play online is they're using tunneling services to use system like over the internet to play other people so that's how they're getting around it so they don't care that they can't connect the live because they're gonna oh they use like a like a warp pipe style thing yes exactly so they're using tunneling services um to basically play online and stuff like that so that's not a big deal and also you know they're not really missing out on anything if there's download content because
3505193	3507214	Is this why we see less and less games supporting System Link?
3509329	3512091	My mind goes to StarCraft 2 and the LAN thing.
3512591	3514632	Well, the LAN thing, that's something different.
3514672	3525318	I think the reason why consoles don't use System Link nowadays is because the games are so sophisticated that they have trouble running them as a server and also running the game at the same time.
3525338	3527660	It's just not easy for them to do it.
3527680	3531482	They have to program it efficiently enough to where they can do that.
3531622	3533443	I wish Grand Theft Auto was System Link because...
3535604	3538546	We would still be playing our mod game because we wouldn't have to update anything.
3538646	3541628	So we could have been doing that, but we had to play over live.
3541988	3546971	Red Dead Redemption was system link, and that's awesome because our internet connection at work sucks.
3547151	3549413	And so a lot of times we get disconnected from live.
3549853	3551554	So system link is definitely the way to go.
3551754	3555117	And also we used to play Saints Row 2, which was a good backup game.
3555177	3558539	If our live ever went down, we could just play a system link game of that.
3559440	3576722	and of course Call of Duty and Halo is always supported systemically because of the land play and stuff like that so they're not going to just take it out because of piracy but yeah it kind of sucks they tried to bypass it but unfortunately there's no way around it
3577102	3577362	I don't know.
3607956	3608296	All right.
3608696	3613037	But yeah, I mean, it's tragic, but, you know, that sort of thing happens.
3613678	3625501	What's also funny, though, actually kind of tying in with the hacking stuff, there was a USB mod chip announced actually for the PlayStation 3 that's going to be released next week.
3626281	3629562	And apparently this chip kind of works like...
3630882	3635385	I guess a tool that they have for actual PlayStation repair and stuff like that.
3635445	3639308	It puts the system into a developer's mode where you can run unsigned code.
3640088	3646533	And apparently this chip or whatever, the USB card, can be updated.
3646573	3650435	You can update the firmware on it so that it can never really be locked out from the system.
3650955	3660042	And also you're going to be able to dump games to your hard drive and run them straight off your hard drive like you could with the PlayStation 2 HD loader and stuff like that.
3661403	3662624	That's something that would be interesting.
3662644	3666027	It's called the PS Jailbreak, even though I don't really think it's a jailbreak.
3666127	3671252	But that will be coming out next week, which will be interesting.
3671472	3683463	Now, what about – I saw this story on some websites, and the story said, well, we don't know what's going on because they're just showing this running on a debug system, which is they're showing a feature that isn't new for a debug system.
3683683	3685525	Well, that was that one video that was from –
3687006	3690408	Don't remember if it was osmodchips.com or something like that.
3690428	3693269	It's one of the stores that's selling them online.
3693289	3695651	They were showing it running on their debug system.
3696071	3704295	But the thing is, the company or whomever that made these chips sent it out to a bunch of different sites to review and test out and stuff like that.
3704435	3709418	And there were other people that do not have debug systems that were running it and doing the same thing.
3709898	3712099	Can't Sony patch this out in minutes?
3713040	3721405	No, because it's the same tool that they use to fix their consoles, so they can't really patch it out because it would fuck up, I think, developer consoles or something like that.
3722706	3736074	Or if they did, basically what they would have to do is ban a certain USB ID or something like that so that it would detect, okay, this is this card, so we're going to make it so that you can't run this anymore.
3737396	3741603	but all they can do is they update the firmware on that card and they can change that ID or whatever.
3744287	3748154	They say that there's no way to ban it and I'd be willing to bet though that
3750277	3751959	They may patch it and they may fix it again.
3752139	3755602	It's just like with the PSP or the DS or the Wii or anything.
3756383	3761527	They put out patches that fix things and fix loopholes, but it may be too hard.
3761687	3769414	And on the other thing too, what this is supposed to do is it will also disable forced updates, forced system updates.
3769494	3774339	So, for example, newer software that comes out has the newer system versions and stuff like that.
3774859	3780803	and you can actually disable it from updating your system so if you're playing offline that won't even be an issue.
3782704	3782984	I don't know.
3783004	3792250	It'll be interesting to watch because now the one console system that was the most secure has now just been cracked wide open so it'll be interesting to see.
3794091	3799655	VidPower in our chatroom says, what is with the term jailbreaking being used for everything that involves hacking?
3800655	3802256	The iPhones use that term too.
3802716	3803057	I don't know.
3803077	3803657	I don't know.
3804139	3806120	It's a clever term and it caught on.
3807381	3808202	It's a buzzword.
3809042	3809843	It's trendy.
3809983	3813605	It kind of makes sense for the iPhone, but it's trendy, so everyone wants to use it now.
3815006	3818248	I'm thinking about jailbreaking my phone just so I can downgrade the stupid OS.
3819148	3821410	I hate iOS 4 on a 3G.
3822370	3828014	Supposedly there's a patch coming, but we'll be waiting, what, two months?
3828154	3833457	Actually, I just updated the patch on my 3GS, and I've noticed it running a little bit better.
3834325	3840682	3GSs are different though I know, but I'm saying that could have been it could have included some fixes I'm not going to hold my breath
3841434	3842295	Diablo 2 Diablo 3 Diablo 4
3864714	3891369	Torchlight originally they wanted to put Torchlight on Xbox Live Arcade but they actually I guess kind of held off for whatever reason didn't end up doing it but now they're apparently putting serious effort into actually making a console version of Torchlight and it was announced at Gamescom by the Runix CEO Max Schaefer quote we're trying we're talking to Sony and Microsoft and we hope to get that done quickly they want to have it available by the holidays
3891949	3902184	Just so you know, this game's actually already moved about 750,000 units, so it's already almost sold close to a million, which isn't bad for a game like this that's been mostly digital distribution.
3903245	3907852	I know I got it on one of those crazy Steam sales, and I'm sure a lot of you guys did as well.
3908833	3909414	Get it that way.
3911095	3914137	Piracy apparently has been an issue with this game, unfortunately.
3914257	3917019	So they can't track how many illegal copies are going on out there.
3917459	3924724	But seeing as Torchlight 2 is going to be multiplayer, and especially if this does go to Xbox Live and so forth, they'll have that to think about.
3925044	3926365	They'll be able to track that a little better.
3927566	3930288	There's also a Torchlight MMO happening at some point.
3930948	3931448	So we'll see.
3932309	3936691	It'll be interesting, though, if Torchlight goes to Xbox Live and PSN because it's only single player.
3937071	3939472	One of its biggest drawbacks is there isn't really multiplayer in it.
3939492	3940733	That's why they're doing Torchlight 2.
3941393	3946956	And a lot of the games on Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network really thrive on a multiplayer environment.
3946996	3947537	Not all of them.
3947657	3949998	Like, what, Mega Man 9 isn't really multiplayer?
3950818	3954240	There's other stuff out there that doesn't have to be multiplayer.
3954780	3954920	But...
3956681	3960403	It would be very cool to have a Diablo-style game on Xbox Live, I think.
3960543	3960823	I don't know.
3960843	3961204	What do you think?
3961224	3962825	You're a fan of Torchlight, right, Alan?
3962865	3966366	What do you think of this game moving to the consoles?
3966947	3974871	Whatever will help it get a larger audience so that if the MMO does come out, it'll succeed, then I'm all for it.
3976171	3976492	All right.
3977572	3981174	Let's move on to some more gaming news, then we'll get to some release dates, DarkSakura.
3981932	3987037	Well, you know how some places have these archaic laws on their books?
3987618	3991662	Like, in Alabama, it's illegal to walk around with an ice cream cone in your back pocket.
3991942	3992403	Did you hear that?
3993533	3994714	Now I want to go and just do it.
3995035	3997678	I don't know if you can walk around with an ice cream cone in your backpack.
3997698	3998179	It would crunch.
3998519	4000001	It's possible, but it'd get soggy.
4001402	4007890	Well, the city of Beacon, New York has one that says that there can't be pinball tables.
4007930	4008971	They're illegal there.
4009532	4011855	And now they're enforcing it.
4012075	4013036	They've shut down a...
4015643	4016504	They shut down a retro arcade.
4016544	4017585	And, you know, them darn kids.
4033180	4034861	You might have to switch mics.
4034881	4041367	The Mayor of Beacon said it was about noise.
4041867	4044910	That people complained about the noise and blah blah blah blah blah.
4046451	4052076	And so they said we'll just use this law as a convenient excuse to enforce the noise thing.
4052536	4053417	Which is bull.
4054297	4055378	I mean seriously?
4056719	4057100	Noise?
4057120	4057220	Noise?
4058764	4062708	I would actually like to see what other businesses are around the people that supposedly complained.
4063909	4068293	So... I'd like to... You know, I think it was on CNN or one of the news channels.
4068313	4070915	They were actually showing this place, and it actually looked kind of cool.
4071355	4075078	And I'm thinking, like, I've never heard of this town until this happened, but...
4075859	4076800	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
4100077	4101258	Yeah, he's shooting himself in the foot.
4101598	4109742	And the guy's saying, oh, we tried to help them save their business and find them other locations and use decibel tests to be objective and blah, blah, blah.
4110322	4111342	It's just crap.
4112523	4113243	That's unfortunate.
4113323	4113704	Yeah.
4114444	4118986	The loudest thing that happens when I play pinball is when I miss and I go, god damn it!
4119887	4121627	And I'm just yelling at the table.
4121727	4123628	Do you think maybe that's what happened there?
4123668	4126210	Was just an outbreak of people saying, god damn it, shit!
4126430	4126590	Yeah.
4127691	4130136	If they had good carpeting, it would have totally muted the noise.
4131448	4140773	There used to be that, there was a little tiny arcade out in Roseville called Supercade years and years ago run by this old gentleman that sadly he got put out of business.
4140793	4142234	But he was in the middle of a strip mall.
4142714	4149638	He had tons of pinball games and arcade games and he never got noise complaints or what have you.
4149658	4155522	There's people that own retro arcade tables and have them out in the Galleria in a hallway.
4155622	4155922	Oh, wow.
4156142	4157142	Yeah.
4157162	4157783	So in the Danos.
4158223	4158563	Interesting.
4160604	4160864	All right.
4161345	4164366	Well, let's start to travel the world and take a look at some release dates.
4164726	4167588	And hopefully these games will not be banned in your local city.
4168638	4173240	Yes, not a whole lot coming out this week, but there's some pretty good stuff.
4174081	4176122	Let's just start with the stuff.
4176582	4177683	Not necessarily good stuff.
4179083	4181685	Martian Panic from Zoo Games.
4181765	4188148	It's a generic arcade shooter game available with a neon green shotgun or by itself.
4188628	4190889	It does, of course, on the Wii.
4190969	4192450	Nancy Drew, Secrets Can Kill 2010.
4192490	4192990	Coming out on PC.
4196692	4201395	Um, Elemental War of Magic on PC as well from Stardock.
4202716	4205277	Um, oh god, I forgot this was coming out.
4206598	4223547	Uh, because someone thought it was a great idea to put Grease the Musical, um, or like the sing-along version of it, I guess, in theaters, there's Grease the Video Game coming out on Wii and DS, where you can sing and dance with the cast of Grease in their cartoony form.
4224348	4224548	Fun.
4224568	4225068	Um,
4226529	4253141	this is pretty cool Gunblade NYC and LA Machine Guns a game I seriously played tons of back in QZAR days coming to the Wii as well for a wonderful $30 retail price just like that House of Dead 2 and 3 collection it should be pretty fun gotta go back and play Ghost Squad some more man that's some fun stuff Elemental War of Magic the limited edition will also be coming out this week as well
4254241	4260245	Mafia 2 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and PC this week.
4261606	4263186	That game from 2K.
4264027	4266729	Harvest Moon Grand Bazaar on DS this week.
4267709	4268630	Here's a game for Rob.
4268950	4272192	Hello Kitty Online coming out on PC this week.
4273152	4274513	Wait, I thought this had been out for a while.
4275788	4277629	Well, apparently it's a disc version of the game.
4277849	4279871	It might have been just digital before.
4280651	4283533	NHL 2K11 on the Wii coming out this week.

4318621	4319282	Thanks for watching!
4336094	4341121	Um, yeah, The Bachelor video game is eventually going to come out at some point, then making way for probably more crappier games.
4341181	4346247	Oh, actually, no, it's making way for more crappier games like Survivor and Minute to Win It.
4347048	4351453	And pretty much any game show that's on TV now is going to have a game based on it.
4351874	4352835	And it's going to be on the Wii.
4353157	4354758	because that's what they do.
4356600	4366166	Battlefield Bad Company 2, the Ultimate Edition, re-released with a bunch of download content and fun download content for Battlefield 1943 as well.
4366747	4368728	Or 1942, I don't remember which game it is.
4369168	4371750	Anyways, that's on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
4373581	4377485	Ghost Pirate of Vuju Island Camp Rock The Final Jam
4391978	4399104	Ace Combat, Joint Assault on PSP, Valkyria Chronicles 2 on PSP as well.

4405188	4408851	Of course, the big one this week, Metroid Other M coming out on the Wii.
4410792	4411073	And...
4413704	4414885	And I believe that's it.
4415205	4417807	Oh, no, there's a couple other crappy games here at the very end.
4418528	4422891	Farmtopia on the DS, my first dollhouse on the DS, and Prison Tycoon Alcatraz on PC.
4423511	4425532	Prison Tycoon Alcatraz, wow.
4426853	4429435	Chat.orange.com, more comments from the chat room.
4430136	4432337	Breakman in our chat says, yay, Amazing Race.
4432437	4433638	Wait, what's the Amazing Race?
4434079	4438802	It's a TV show here, and I thought they had it in other countries, maybe not.
4439002	4439262	DarkSakura.com
4461849	4462569	It's a show.
4463049	4463830	And let's see.
4464850	4466650	Chat.orangesauce.com, more comments.
4468551	4469551	Where's the mole game?
4469651	4470411	Asks Frisbee.
4470611	4471211	Excellent question.
4471231	4472632	That was the best reality show they ever did.
4473032	4476353	Monty Boggs says, how come Big Brother Wii doesn't sound appealing to me?
4476413	4476993	Ha ha ha.
4477333	4478433	Because you're not trashy.
4478633	4479973	They still may do that.
4480013	4481314	I mean, if you think about it.
4481614	4483134	If the Survivor game sells, why not?
4483174	4485855	They had, was it America's Top...
4486315	4487436	Do they have America's Top Model?
4487456	4487896	I think they do.
4488136	4494460	They had America's Top Model and... What other crappy games did they have?
4496301	4498583	Wipeout, they had a thing for that.
4498603	4505067	I get Minute to Win It because they're just going to do Wii versions of all those stupid games they play on that show.
4505367	4509129	Let's go to Target, the game, and buy paper cups and ping pong balls.
4509229	4509590	It's like...
4510370	4518509	Pay somebody a million dollars to do the tricks I'm surprised they don't have a home game yet I believe it's coming out If it's not already out
4520069	4522271	It's not hard to do a home version a minute to win it.
4522411	4523512	Go to the dollar store.
4523972	4524593	Exactly.
4524653	4525754	Dollar store the game.
4527935	4530798	SSG100 Matt says, Robin Allen should be on The Amazing Race.
4530898	4531919	Them or Robin Jamie?
4532419	4538324	Actually, I don't know how Allen feels about being on network TV like The Amazing Race, but I gotta say me and my friend Victoria have been talking about it for at least two years.
4538744	4540245	How badly we need to go on The Amazing Race.
4540626	4549453	And I don't drive and there's usually, you know, you have to get into like a Jeep and one person does something while the other person drives and I couldn't do that.
4550017	4575422	My favorite task I ever saw in The Amazing Race was when they were in Thailand and they had to get in these taxis but they're karaoke taxis and they actually had to sing Thai karaoke songs from point A to point B or whatever but they were actually singing with women in the backseat but they were actually female impersonators and some of the teams didn't even catch on to it that they were singing with Taiwan Asian female impersonators.
4575582	4578003	Was there like a bro team asking for their number?
4578503	4593300	I think there was you know if there was they showed it on TV but the challenge cracked me up because it was I do for Xenocore they do need a supermarket sweep game I thought there was one a while ago a supermarket sweep game like on PC or something yeah yeah
4594220	4594921	I love that game.
4595141	4598203	Watching that on, what was it, Lifetime?
4598783	4599684	Also, Press Your Luck.
4599744	4601225	There is a Press Your Luck game on Wii.
4601285	4603066	And I think there's another one coming out this year, too.
4603166	4605308	Yeah, there's Press Your Luck, A Price is Right.
4605328	4607749	There's a new Wheel of Fortune game, New Jeopardy.
4608090	4613213	A lot of those games, a lot of those game shows are actually out.
4613653	4622899	I don't know how good they are, but I seem to remember X-Link called into the show some time ago, and he's told me about it since then, that the Press Your Luck game is surprisingly not bad.
4623180	4623400	I mean,
4624221	4625962	You get what you pay for, right?
4626122	4629446	I mean, if you buy a Press Your Luck game, you know exactly what game you're buying.
4630286	4631568	It's not a big surprise.
4632008	4633950	So it's just, you know, is it responsive?
4635071	4637653	Do the questions repeat after playing it three times?
4638815	4640136	That's all you really need, right?
4641117	4643099	You know what you're buying when you buy the Press Your Luck home game.
4643599	4645260	Alright, let's get to the Japanese release dates.
4645300	4646101	Enough about game shows.
4646301	4647542	I could talk all day about game shows.
4647582	4648162	I love game shows.
4648582	4654986	But let me get to some, in fact, I would love to see the Sherry Shepard version of the newlywed game because you know she's going to make a great host, I think.
4655006	4657528	I was going to comment about the American Next Top Model game.
4657988	4662171	Didn't sell well because no matter what you did, Tyra got a better score than you and then she yelled at you.
4663752	4665013	So that didn't sell well.
4669272	4670293	So here's a question, though.
4670813	4674395	What would happen if you had Tyra play the America's Top Model game?
4674795	4678958	Now, would it go into an infinite loop like, you know, the Tic-Tac-Toe game in War Games?
4678998	4679678	You know, would it do that?
4679718	4684901	If she still had her show, she would have used this opportunity to see, now me, and here's my game.
4685221	4686662	I had so much fun recording this.
4686722	4690424	I had so much fun doing my game because, you know, the Tyra show really was the Tyra show.
4690465	4691065	It was about Tyra.
4691465	4701613	Like she could have on these like starving, she'd be doing a whole show on anorexia and bulimia and one time she'd be like, I just, I remember this one time when I was at a restaurant and I didn't want to eat what was in front of me and I found that to be so hard.
4701833	4707418	Yeah, I cried that I had the salad and it was very devastating to me emotionally.
4710416	4710636	Yeah.
4712637	4714417	Let's go to Japanese release dates.
4715537	4719358	Kane and Lynch 2 Dog Days comes out on the 26th on the Xbox 360.
4719418	4720938	Hip hip hooray.
4721699	4726220	That is a Japanese release, so I don't know if they fully localized it or what, but that is coming out.
4727280	4728680	They're actually played by dogs now.
4730020	4731001	Now that I buy.
4734983	4737606	That would make the Kane and Lynch series like ten times better.
4738587	4739528	If it was like a buddy dog movie.
4739568	4743673	A gritty crime drama with canines, dogs, you know.
4745114	4747097	Hold down R2 to scoot your butt, you know.
4753522	4781884	Alright, on the Playstation 3, Kane and Lynch 2 Dog Day is also coming out over there No word if you can, you know, press R3 to poop Agarest Senkei Zero, Compile Heart Selection comes out as well I don't know if this is, I'm imagining it's some type of compilation It's the record of the Agarest Wars, I believe Or at least maybe a sequel to it, the one where you can breed It is a prelude to Agarest Zenki, so it is actually a prequel Okay, so it's a prequel to the breeding game Yes, so there you go You have to breed to create the new game, yeah
4782584	4784525	That has something in common with the dog game then.
4786226	4792008	Let's see, moving to... Man, Nintendogs would be so much cooler if they gave the dogs guns.
4793189	4793829	Don't you think?
4794149	4795730	Would they have a game like that?
4795830	4796711	I forget.
4798351	4800472	This got brought up at my work the other day too.
4800732	4803194	Someone said, it would be even cooler if dogs had guns on their back.
4803654	4804994	Yeah, but they've done that.
4805375	4806275	It's metal...
4808616	4832757	Metal Max or something is what it's called like Metal Saga was what it came out over here and they have like you know literally dogs with artillery cannons on their back like ridiculous stuff it's awesome coming out on the Wii in Japan oh I talked about this last week but this is the week it's coming out on the 26th Twinkle Queen comes out on the Nintendo Wii what kind of game do you think Twinkle Queen is Alan?
4833037	4834919	I don't know but I'm still waiting for my royalty check
4837536	4839338	I think it's Twinkle Starsprites.
4861599	4863281	So is Carmen Sandiego coming back?
4863441	4865182	I don't think it's those type of PC games.
4865423	4868645	I don't think of laid back and tea drinker as the same.
4868685	4875612	I think of, you know, tight assed and, you know, ramrod straight back tea drinker being proper.
4876297	4881040	Character themes and other background music will be imported from the originals and rearranged for Twinkle Queen.
4881460	4885023	A maximum of four players can play the game at a time.
4885303	4885683	So I love it.
4885703	4887685	It's PC games, but it's coming out on the Wii.
4888005	4888525	So go figure.
4888545	4893809	I'm looking at the screenshots and I don't see Carmen Sandiego, but I do see a lot of scantily clad women.
4893949	4895510	Oh, that's Katamari Damacy.
4895550	4896851	That's the queen from Katamari Damacy.
4897271	4897651	She's there.
4898652	4901034	I think you'd be laid back if your tea was laced with something.
4901274	4902715	Isn't that the queen from Katamari Damacy?
4902975	4903595	Yes, it is.
4904316	4905456	Is this a Romco Bandai game?
4905697	4905937	Is it?
4906737	4907718	No, it's from Milestone.
4908239	4910240	Maybe they licensed it or something.
4910541	4912442	I swear that looks like the queen from Katamari no Ashi.
4913543	4914424	No, she's wearing a kimono.
4915525	4916626	So was it a fighting game?
4916786	4918227	It's probably something behind her head.
4918607	4919028	Interesting.
4920109	4920649	That's not her.
4921590	4921930	Oh, well.
4922631	4923031	That picture.
4923291	4924512	Chicks beating each other up.
4924572	4927535	I mean, you know, we haven't seen that before.
4928035	4928856	Well, actually we have.
4930618	4931639	Nah, it's a joke.
4932560	4934721	You've seen it tons of times, that's why I'm joking.
4935222	4937023	Alright, anyhow, moving on to the handhelds.
4939445	4941327	There's nothing on PlayStation 2, just so you know.
4942307	4952295	On the Sony PSP, Ace Combat Joint Assault, Hakioki Zusoruku Portable comes out this week from Idea Factory.
4952495	4953736	I don't know what this game is.
4953817	4957880	This is an adventure game that...
4961363	4962443	Mon Huniki, Poka Poka, Ailu Mura Poka Poka
4985848	4987269	That's coming out from Capcom.
4987869	4990970	I'm trying to see what game it is, if it's something we would know here.
4990990	4993330	You guys recognize this game?
4995871	4997792	They look like the characters from Animal Crossing, don't they?
4997852	4998592	Hold on, hold on.
4998632	5000512	This is like a PSP version of Animal Crossing.
5001473	5002093	No, it's not.
5002193	5006234	It's the little, I think, ASCII cat people.
5006914	5009155	They kind of look like Doraemon, a little bit.
5009395	5009935	A little bit.
5009995	5011015	But no, they have ears.
5011035	5011856	Interesting.
5012896	5013256	Interesting.
5015653	5033279	quickly on the DS sorry I'm taking a long time here I want to get through this quickly on the Nintendo DS nothing really notable that comes out this week unfortunately so just want to make sure I got them all so there you go those are your Japanese release dates let's go to jolly old England and talk about their releases DarkSakura
5033826	5036888	Well, on the 24th, we have Grease for Wii and DS.
5037048	5043573	The 24th, we also have Gunblade New York and LA Machine Guns Arcade, which, dude, I'm a big fan of Gunblade New York, for the record.
5044433	5046014	We also have Ivy the Kiwi.
5046995	5049937	It's got a question mark at the end, so it's Ivy the Kiwi?
5050998	5051578	What's going on here?
5054071	5055532	You have cut out yet again.
5055692	5056173	Jeez!
5056313	5057214	Live radio, folks.
5057474	5058535	We have Ivy the Kiwi.
5059415	5059856	Kiwi.
5060756	5061096	Shank.
5061817	5063819	And on the 25th, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World.
5064339	5066641	And Shank again on Xbox 360.
5067561	5071625	On the 27th, Mafia 2 for PC, PS3, and 360.
5074106	5074407	Alright.
5074647	5075007	That's it.
5076528	5079611	A few more news stories for you guys in the classic game of the week.
5080772	5092180	Sony has been ordered to pay 5 million yen to a former Sony employee who is named Hiro Kume.
5092720	5099625	And he invented, I guess, a small optical pickup that was used to read and write discs in the PlayStation 2 and the original PlayStation.
5100445	5126717	of course he felt that Sony didn't recognize his contributions and he took them to court and he won so that's not bad and it roughly translates to about $60,000 is what he won and he says I thank the court for identifying some of my contributions to the company but the company should have appreciated my contributions when I was an employee
5129311	5130771	Ouch, scathing a little bit.
5132364	5139469	Speaking of lawsuits, this guy, Craig Smallwood apparently is his name, sued the makers of Lineage.
5139889	5145913	He wants basically them to fess up to the fact that their game is too damn addicting, in so many words.
5146513	5157140	He says that Lineage 2 specifically is so addicting that he is, quote, unable to function independently in usual daily activities such as getting up, getting undressed, bathing, or communicating with family and friends.
5157581	5159242	Apparently he played the game for 20,000 hours.
5161423	5189789	between 2004 and 2009 that's like literally half of every single day playing Lineage 2 hmm apparently it's negligence and gross negligence there we know it's interesting Bobby was talking about this story on his show too and he found through some other resources I guess that the guy was actually running a gold farming service in this game and that's because you'll notice it says he played for 20,000 hours between 2004 and 2009 doesn't really point out why he stopped
5190869	5194211	So is he really addicted to the game, or is he just a jilted gold farmer?
5194411	5194771	I don't know.
5195192	5208119	Yeah, it seems like a combination of, I don't know, OCD that could be a legitimate situation that he was in, but also he had, I guess from when we were listening to Bobby Blackwolf's show, he had three accounts that he was using to gold farm.
5208880	5212302	Maybe he realized that his return on investment was so much better the more
5212922	5215024	I have to play 12 hours a day because then I'll make $100 this week.
5215104	5215565	That could be it.
5215585	5218828	Let's just assume that wasn't even all a factor.
5230100	5239690	Let's just assume that's off the table for a minute here We're just talking about somebody suing the makers of the game they've become addicted to because their game is too addicting I mean, really?
5240090	5243914	Does that mean I can sue McDonald's because I'm addicted to Chicken McNuggets and they made me fat?
5244275	5245776	They've tried, people have tried Really?
5246597	5247158	What a country
5247719	5248700	I know, it's ridiculous.
5249181	5252524	The whole thing is coming down to lack of self-control.
5254125	5255367	I love Star Trek Online.
5255567	5256928	You know how much I love the damn game.
5257429	5260212	Guess who doesn't stay logged into it for more than two hours at a time?
5260612	5261192	That would be me.
5262394	5265377	Even if my friends in the UK are on, I log off.
5266378	5267499	As much as I love talking to them.
5268584	5276493	You know, when I was playing Ragnarok, maybe I would leave it on to vend, but I would walk away from my computer.
5277133	5279896	You know, it's addiction.
5280297	5281558	Well, not really addiction.
5282119	5282659	There's no...
5284033	5294719	Now the only thing that I could remotely say that this has any kind of physical effect is, this is getting into a little bit of chemical psychology, is what stimulates the pleasure centers of the brain.
5295679	5297220	And that does become addicting.
5297901	5303323	You know, for example, love has the same effect in the brain that cocaine can.
5304284	5305344	You know.
5305865	5310267	And that's the only way I can see any kind of addiction possibly forming.
5311108	5313509	But that's where the self-control comes in.
5315347	5319389	It may be hard, but you have to take some time for yourself.
5319509	5320469	Get away from the game.
5321490	5323211	I don't know what Lineage 2 has in place.
5323251	5324251	It's not a game I've played.
5324291	5325272	I don't think it's as popular.
5325332	5329273	I played it at E3 a few years ago and have a can of Coke in my vault.
5330214	5332255	Oh, was that the game that gave away the soda?
5332335	5332615	Hold on.
5332935	5334116	This was years ago.
5335716	5336457	I think I remember it now.
5336477	5337237	It wasn't a bad game.
5337257	5338137	I haven't.
5339758	5342060	It's way more popular in Asia than it is here.
5342080	5346845	In fact, when I say way more popular, I mean like, you know, WoW is the US game, obviously.
5346925	5350568	Lineage and Lineage 2 are like twice that, what it is here.
5351569	5356333	Yeah, I recognize the art style on this can, the character creation, yeah.
5356863	5358525	But Lineage is a huge game over there.
5358545	5361127	And obviously, I believe this gentleman lives in Hawaii.
5361667	5365591	So Hawaii kind of gets a little bit of a blending of both cultures a lot of times.
5366992	5369314	So Lineage probably has a pretty good fan base there.
5369334	5372417	I mean, certainly has its players here in the continental US too.
5372477	5374099	But I don't know.
5374139	5374399	It's just...
5376460	5388933	A lot of other games I've played, like WoW, you know, and, you know, I joke that I'm addicted to WoW, but at the end of the day, like, for instance, Alan and I went to Reno this weekend, and we walked away, and believe it or not, we're okay.
5389333	5391235	We're gonna run our daily the minute we get home.
5392436	5409043	There have been times in WoW where it's like, you know, maybe midnight, 1am, I've done my daily and my daily rep whatever BS, and I'm not tired yet, but I'm just on my mount doing laps around Dalaran, and I'm not really playing.
5409163	5410824	I'm like, what am I doing right now?
5411244	5412084	I'm in WoW.
5412684	5413485	I have nothing to do.
5413825	5414765	I should just log off.
5414965	5419487	And I've had moments where I just have to make myself sign off because I'm not playing.
5419507	5421688	Because I've done that, but it's because I'm chatting with people.
5422208	5424671	I'll be running laps in Dalaran, but I'm also chatting.
5424752	5428516	Well, I'll be reading trade or whatever, but it's like, yeah.
5428697	5431721	There's nothing morally redeeming about trade chat.
5431841	5433703	Yeah, it's like 4chan, but in WoW.
5434464	5434845	Pretty much.
5436204	5443370	But WoW, when you log in... Well, I don't remember if WoW has it when you log in, but at least I know some of the tip screens say... Loading screen, yeah.
5443390	5447233	Some of the loading screens will say, remember to take everything in moderation, including Warcraft.
5447513	5448234	I remember that.
5448314	5450736	Final Fantasy XI had a disclaimer.
5450776	5452418	You had to click every time.
5452818	5454560	Don't forget your friends, family, or work.
5454620	5455701	You know, this whole little spiel.
5455741	5456561	Every two or three hours?
5456822	5458864	No, every time you logged into the game, you had to click it.
5459324	5460185	Yeah, I remember that.
5461065	5461586	But, I mean...
5463247	5465248	It really does come back.
5465468	5470070	I can be on AIM and get caught up in a conversation with somebody.
5470130	5471650	That's one thing.
5471750	5476732	I could be online reading news articles and get caught up in reading.
5476792	5478753	Or I do it with Wikipedia all the damn time.
5479513	5484535	But the whole thing is to catch yourself, to make reminders.
5485535	5486876	When you notice the time...
5488920	5491441	Then, oh crap, I've gone on too long.
5491641	5493001	You know, I'll have to check this later.
5493241	5501384	You know, I don't really think, I think that maybe going like an hour or two over when you decided, you know, that you wanted to stop.
5502345	5503765	That's kind of understandable.
5504265	5512528	Getting caught up is human nature, but to make a habit of it and to play to the exclusion of all else, that's when it gets unhealthy.
5515908	5522934	Well, again, I don't know if he's going to be very successful suing the makers of the game because he couldn't control himself.
5523194	5525376	I just think it would set a horrific precedence.
5526317	5528679	We could sue anything that had a negative effect on us.
5530721	5532042	You have to have some self-control.
5533123	5538407	It's just kind of sad that the judge wouldn't throw it out, but nope, the judge actually is allowing the case to proceed.
5539528	5540549	That should be interesting.
5541169	5544112	You know why I would think it would be a good idea to let a case like that proceed?
5545480	5546380	So he's struck down.
5546560	5547601	Setting legal precedence.
5548342	5548802	I can see that.
5550303	5550663	Let's see.
5550744	5556568	Xenocor in our chatroom at chat.orange.radio.com says, Lineage 2 is an Unreal Engine converted grinding piece of shit.
5556668	5557268	Or POS.
5557348	5558569	I'm assuming meaning piece of shit.
5559290	5562472	TigerClaw says, You know, StarCraft 2 can be quite addicting.
5562512	5566455	The other night I was playing it late at night and by the time I stopped it was like 5am in the morning.
5566995	5568096	Yeah, a lot of video games.
5568116	5570178	I mean, StarCraft I've heard of tons of addictions.
5570198	5570498	Well,
5570618	5598451	you know addictions of varying degrees stories of that but there's I'm sure there's lots of video games even Jamie has talked about when you were in high school or college you stayed out for a week to play Final Fantasy 6 granted I did have the flu legitimately but all I did was play Final Fantasy it was Final Fantasy 3 6 over in Japan that's the only game I've ever you know played while I was that sick
5599791	5602435	I played a lot of Final Fantasy 7 when I was supposed to be in college.
5617924	5621687	I'd skip class from time to time to watch Sailor Moon or play Toshinden.
5622668	5628954	I mean, and when my friend had his, he had a Saturn before everybody else because he imported it.
5629694	5633938	And I stayed up all night playing the damn Gundam game and King of Fighters.
5635679	5638782	But that's one time, you know.
5639249	5641672	DarkSakura, what should the kids be worshipping this week?
5660473	5661874	The game is called Recca.
5663674	5666295	And this game was made for the Summer Carnival in 1992.
5666395	5673558	It's a very limited printing of it, but it's amazing for a NES game.
5674139	5674959	This is some music.
5684943	5688144	So you see, it's got a pretty rad soundtrack for a NES game.
5688644	5689485	All I hear are the bullets.
5690973	5692495	I've got the soundtrack to this.
5692995	5703125	But now, the game itself is probably one of the, I would say, earlier games that could be considered bullet hell.
5703886	5704927	Really, I think it could be.
5704947	5709972	I mean, you see who in the chatroom got freaking excited was one of our bullet hell fans.
5711514	5711574	Um...
5713769	5717511	But RECCA is pretty damn hardcore.
5717551	5718872	I mean, we've got ROMs of it.
5718892	5722954	You can actually buy... Let me get the site again.
5723014	5732158	I think it was reccanes.net You can buy reproduction cartridges to play on US systems.
5732918	5733659	Which is pretty cool.
5734759	5741963	But the game, what makes it really special is that it is one of the...
5744108	5745809	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5768401	5769342	It looks really amazing.
5769382	5773324	The framerate for a NES game, even on the YouTube, it's blazing fast.
5773384	5774445	I'm really impressed by this.
5774525	5777427	It really does play that fast.
5779228	5789555	The game itself was published by Naxxast Soft, that's N-A-X-A-T, in 1992, like I said, for the Summer Carnival.
5790715	5792176	It is a side-scroller.
5792196	5792356	It has...
5795778	5796559	Yeah, and, um...
5821914	5824335	And the soundtrack for it is freaking amazing.
5826016	5837941	The other things that you have with this, too, is that instead of having bombs, that when you stop shooting, you can build up a power surge and deflect incoming fire.
5838581	5843343	And then if you charge a long time, then it'll clear the screen the way a bomb would do.
5847247	5850489	It's really hard to do that, though, because you can see how fast the enemies come at you.
5851049	5853170	And look at the effects in the background.
5853230	5857353	I mean, that's very, you know, looks almost Mode 7-ish, I should say.
5858413	5860714	And this was before there was such a thing as Mode 7.
5861855	5865057	It has a normal score attack and time attack.
5865197	5866557	It's single player only.
5867498	5867598	Um...
5869438	5870179	The game is cool.
5870419	5873821	You've got five primary weapons and then five optional weapons.
5874702	5877543	So you get different power-ups and you can shoot different ways.
5877703	5880265	It's just really, really amazing.
5880806	5885929	But it's the typical story, you have to fight off the aliens, blah blah, save the Earth.
5887456	5894123	and I think that Rekka is just a freaking cool name for a game that needs a blazing fire.
5895144	5899148	But the official name is Legend Consumer Series Summer Carnival 92 Rekka.
5903189	5904950	and good luck freaking finding it.
5905291	5908895	I just even love that idea of flying up the tunnel and then flying back down.
5908935	5911918	You just don't see that in a lot of shooters, at least that I can think of.
5913359	5917704	In fact, shooters are almost always ship is on the bottom and you're moving your way up.
5918284	5920106	Or you're fully side.
5920166	5925412	You rarely ever see it the other way around where you're flying at the top of the screen and you're moving down.
5925632	5933816	You know the only other game that I've seen some kind of innovation for the standard side-scrolling shooter was that same Gundam game that was on the Saturn back in the day when it came out.
5934237	5936418	Because you had three planes.
5937638	5941400	You were in the middle ground, but you had foreground and background enemies to fight too.
5941420	5943722	And now this here is stationary.
5944742	5948184	Not just that as a non-standard shooter, but I always think of, of course, this game.
5948204	5950085	We never talk enough about it here on Orange Lines Radio.
5950445	5956888	One of the most underrated NES games they ever made, The Guardian Legend, was half shooter and a decent shooter at that, and then half Zelda-ish game.
5957208	5962070	In fact, if we do end up doing our little Labor Day marathon, I think we should just play the shit out of that game and beat it.
5962190	5963070	Dude, I'm all for it.
5963210	5964271	I'm all for it.
5966132	5968913	But yeah, see that right there, though, is an example of the charging move.
5971718	5972819	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6002785	6007487	Hitstun in our chatroom is saying that Legend Consumer Series only applies to the soundtrack.
6007547	6009388	It's just Summer Carnival 92, Rekka.
6012550	6012810	Cut out.
6013690	6013931	What?
6016092	6017532	The soundtrack is worth having.
6019113	6020934	I found it actually to download somewhere.
6021795	6024636	So, speaking of the soundtrack, go get it.
6025716	6026757	The music is really sweet.
6027446	6034956	Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week, Rekka, or if you want Summer Carnival 92 Rekka, for the Nintendo Entertainment System.
6035016	6039622	Good luck finding that, although it does sound like you can get the reproduced cartridges, if nothing else.
6040023	6040804	Yeah.
6040824	6041425	Somebody get me one.
6042426	6045267	That's going to do it for Part A here at Orange Lounge Radio, but we're not done yet.
6045307	6048849	We've got more news coming up in Part B. We're going to talk a little bit about Rock Band 3.
6049749	6051190	Talk a little bit about Dance Central, too.
6051250	6051990	Lots of music game news.
6052010	6054351	We're going to talk about a new drawing tablet on the Wii.
6054911	6056712	Talk, of course, a little bit about Doctor Who.
6057252	6058432	And more hacking news.
6058893	6061874	And also, ways to cut the lines at PAX.
6062594	6064736	I'm very interested to see what the chatters think about this story.
6064756	6073064	We're going to be getting to this, your emails, your Twitter topics, and much more, your phone calls when we come back here at the show where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.
6079913	6082275	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
6082335	6091744	We are live on this Sunday evening, August the 22nd of 2010, where we are taping live the 378th episode of our show.
6092625	6094186	Yeah, it's been about eight and a half years.
6094506	6094947	So there you go.
6095539	6096519	Thanks for watching!
6115686	6117468	Ticket Spitters, you know, gambling for kids.
6118048	6125014	I did see a smaller arcade that I never got a chance to actually go into that had a lot of Capcom stuff, like they had MVC2.
6125054	6127696	Yeah, I remember when we were looking in there, you're like, no, that's my kind of arcade.
6128357	6130678	Yeah, well, it's like my, you know, I've got 10 bucks.
6130819	6134241	Is it going to last longer on slots or on arcade games?
6135002	6136043	So arcade games won.
6137614	6139575	Ray Ayanami says we should have gone to Atlantis.
6139615	6140355	What do they have there?
6140415	6145478	Oh, they probably have really... The problem with a lot of those huge, huge ones, they're not downtown.
6145578	6150380	So they take, you know... The downtown ones are much easier because they're all kind of in the same city block.
6150400	6151821	You don't have to get in the car and go, whatever.
6152361	6154442	Anything else interesting in Reno that you came across?
6156643	6161265	The fact that it's kind of... I don't want... How can I say this without sounding pretentious?
6161305	6162245	Just Reno is...
6163846	6164886	Kind of low budget.
6164927	6165927	I mean, that's kind of the point.
6166127	6169908	If you can afford to go to Vegas, you just go to Vegas.
6170109	6171889	So Reno's really kind of watered down.
6172930	6183734	We had a hilariously awful dining experience there, which I thought was funny, considering it's this amazing sort of, you know, the El Dorado, Silver Legacy, Circus Circus, it's all one big mall.
6183754	6184554	They're all connected.
6184594	6185795	You can just stay in that facility.
6186375	6189136	So it was after Rocky, and it was around 11.30.
6189796	6191337	We were all starving and exhausted.
6192097	6199959	So we sat down, took it, not even kidding, not kidding, 30 minutes for her to take our order, another 35 for our food to arrive.
6200799	6213902	So we were at the table for about an hour before any food showed up, and I had joked that when we got our receipt for the tip section, we should write in the margin, we put your tip in that slot machine and you should go get it.
6215323	6215843	Very nice.
6217043	6219504	I've taken something from my best friend.
6220104	6220904	She leaves two cents.
6222699	6223820	Yeah, I've done that before.
6223880	6231929	I once was in, I think it was in Olive Garden, which is why I don't like going there, where the friend and I that I was with, we left like seven cents.
6231989	6235593	It was a very specific amount of change to where they knew it was deliberate.
6235993	6238196	Well, you know, it was hard though in that case.
6238436	6243702	I really don't like doing that unless it really is clearly this wait person's fault.
6244022	6244823	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6264065	6265746	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6294626	6295646	So just bear with us.
6295666	6297067	This is what happens when you tape a show live.
6297107	6298569	So we're going to disconnect right now.
6300765	6302726	Ha ha, the live listeners can't hear us right now.
6303586	6305607	Are there any live listeners you want to talk smack about while we're doing this?
6306008	6307368	Smack, smack, smack, smack.
6307388	6308209	All right, let's reconnect.
6309209	6313151	All right, so we're reconnected, so we'll see if that hopefully helps the problem.
6313692	6319555	I don't know, but everything otherwise looks good on our end, so it could be on the all games end as well.
6320215	6321576	I don't know, so we'll see.
6322136	6329580	Anyhow, let's move on to some rapid fire news and all the quick little things that, you know, if we had a five hour show we could talk more about.
6329720	6329900	Loki?
6331548	6332148	Let's start us off.
6332929	6333389	Let's see.
6333509	6335890	So, there's some interesting stuff here.
6336030	6342713	We'll start with, of course, something from Dragon Quest IX.
6343154	6345535	And there was something you mentioned, Robin.
6345575	6347115	I don't think it was Dragon Quest.
6347215	6347696	It was...
6350214	6350734	Thanks for watching!
6370854	6382839	Well, anyways, apparently Dragon Quest... I guess this is... Yeah, Dragon Quest IX, there's something you can purchase, I guess.
6383059	6386420	It's Poof Poof, or Puff Puff.
6386980	6390022	I guess Puff Puff Performance is a quest you can unlock.
6391102	6407172	and um apparently Puff Puff is uh interesting because obviously this is an E10 game there is no sex involved but uh Puff Puff I guess is coming I read this it's uh
6408852	6409112	Pafu Pafu
6438084	6444347	Funny enough, it's not really her breasts rubbing against his face, but it's two slimes against his face, but still.
6445848	6446588	Kind of scandalous.
6446709	6447129	A little bit.
6447449	6447829	A little bit.
6448309	6449570	Is that really the sound that makes?
6449790	6450510	Pafu, pafu?
6450691	6451231	Is that what they say?
6451251	6452131	You should ask Victoria.
6453392	6453772	I don't know.
6454212	6455513	Jamie, could you come over here for a minute?
6457134	6457474	Sure.
6460115	6461296	We have an experiment we need to try.
6461336	6462717	Okay, we're going to put the microphone right there.
6466411	6467492	Very Pufu Pufu like.
6468773	6469574	Boobs, what do you have to say?
6470935	6471676	They don't say anything.
6471836	6472116	I see.
6473377	6474418	They just sit there and look pretty.
6476420	6478181	Apparently it's in the game and it's funny.
6478441	6485307	They had a funny video of it as well online and it's very filled with innuendo.
6486528	6490412	But E10, so it'd be different if it was a mature raid game.
6491873	6491933	Um...
6493775	6500138	Red Faction Battlegrounds has been announced for Xbox Live Arcade and the PlayStation Network by THQ Digital.
6500538	6503799	It is going to be a prequel to Red Faction Armageddon.
6504540	6513163	And if, I should say, if THQ has it their way, they want to put the game out for free or close to free as possible.
6513503	6519946	Perhaps as a pre-order incentive for ordering Red Faction Armageddon.
6521437	6523379	So that sounds kind of cool.
6524661	6527504	And is expected to come out sometime in 2011.
6528265	6530848	Probably three or four months before the game is released.
6531168	6533151	Or Red Faction Armageddon is released.
6535731	6536491	So that's interesting.
6537191	6548075	And then finally, if you're a fan of music games, and who isn't, there is a brand new browser-based music game you can check out called Instant Jam.
6548235	6549915	It comes from Instant Action.
6550735	6554697	And it's a game that looks very similar to, say, like a Guitar Hero game.
6556837	6563224	One of those games where you have the no highway and the different things coming down.
6564365	6576377	Apparently it supports your own music library and it also supports keyboard or USB guitar controllers and allows for in-game music purchases as well through Amazon or iTunes.
6577398	6579220	I guess it's a version of download content.
6582756	6591925	There is a beta currently available through Facebook and versions playable through the website and elsewhere will be rolled out soon.
6595805	6597786	Well, let's move on with some other stories here.
6598067	6599828	And I want to talk about Speaking Music Games.
6599928	6602930	Dance Central has some new songs announced for it.
6603671	6605252	Ten more songs announced this week.
6606072	6620222	Nelly Furtado with Maneater, Basement Jax with Rendezvous, Benny Benassi with Satisfaction, Nina Sky with Move Ya Body, Cascada with Evacuate the Dance Floor, Pitbull with I Know You Want Me, Calle Ocho.
6620543	6621103	Is that that?
6621543	6622704	I know you want me.
6623344	6624365	I know I want ya.
6625946	6627007	Sounds like Strong Bad singing.
6627707	6631989	Fanny Pack with Hey... Too bad it's not the Fanny Pack song.
6632369	6633990	Camel Toe, but it's Hey Mami.
6634170	6634250	Mami?
6634430	6634650	M-A-M-I.
6634690	6635331	Yeah, Mami.
6636251	6636931	Mami?
6637252	6637952	Mami is M-O-M-M-Y.
6640939	6642720	Depends on if it's a name.
6642760	6643080	Whatever.
6643361	6644541	Or another language.
6644881	6656369	Rihanna has Ponda Replay, Cool and the Gang, Jungle Boogie, Technotronic with Pump Up the Jam, and Kylie Minogue with Can't Get You Out of My Head.
6657489	6659771	That was a fun song when it was in DDR like years and years ago.
6659791	6660931	I likes Kylie.
6660951	6661312	It's cool.
6661612	6667175	I was going to say there was some other songs as well I can confirm that are going to be in the game.
6667215	6668076	In fact, I'm looking...
6668456	6670817	Oh, is that the whole lyric spill thing that happened?
6671057	6672899	No, no, not even.
6673459	6674479	More scandalous than that.
6675800	6680803	No, this is wonderful people that shouldn't be in places that they are.
6680823	6683925	Are they naughty people that have already gotten copies of the game somehow?
6683945	6688247	They're naughty people that have gotten copies of the beta that's on PartnerNet.
6688687	6689487	Oh no!
6689508	6696251	Of course, they can't play anything because it requires a Kinect camera, but it doesn't mean that they won't know what songs are on there.
6697891	6702033	And included in there, I'm not sure if these have been already announced, Lady Gaga's Poker Face.
6702073	6703254	Yeah, it was in the demo.
6703294	6712698	Lips Inc., Mouth to Mouth, M.I.A., Arlor, No Doubt, Rocksteady, Bell Biv, The Vogue, Poison, and BC Boy's Body Move in the Fat Boy Slim remix.
6712898	6716205	A few of those were already out there, but I don't remember the MIA song being announced.
6716586	6717688	That's news to me.
6718249	6718570	Interesting.
6721184	6721444	All right.
6722305	6725948	Well, we'll see what the song list looks like anyway.
6726268	6730191	I'm sure not too much longer we'll have the full song list announced.
6730231	6732613	I'll probably give you about 10 songs a week until it's all out there.
6733194	6734895	Anyhow, how about Toy Story 3?
6735916	6737017	Yeah, it's not just a movie.
6737077	6737917	It's a game as well.
6738298	6739138	The game is out there.
6739218	6740539	It's on the Wii, I'm sure.
6740599	6743121	It's also on the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3.
6743982	6749987	In fact, the PlayStation 3 is taking the opportunity of having this unique hybrid premium edition.
6750447	6771100	So there is actually a new version out there of Toy Story 3 bundled with the original Toy Story movie on a single Blu-ray disc for $64.99 So it's interesting that it's not just like a combo pack but it's actually both things were put onto one disc for $65 Interesting
6775060	6782241	but sadly it's not both Toy Story and Toy Story 2 otherwise that would be a really killer deal but what about Toy Story 2?
6784608	6787410	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6813627	6834057	you can't type in your own stuff you have to use the pre-selected phrases and things that have been selected for you well one of the other things you can do in the game is that you can pick your own car number because of course you're playing race cars so you can have whatever car number you want except for 69 you cannot be car 69 in the cars MMO can you be car 420?
6835198	6840020	no because the cars only have two digits but you could be car 54 and you could be like where are you?
6841141	6841481	old joke
6843825	6845486	So it had the dude that played Herman Munster.
6845506	6846087	Yep, it did.
6846907	6847347	There you go.
6847768	6854291	So yeah, when you're selecting, apparently when you're in the game selecting the number for your car, if you go like, you select each digit one at a time.
6854331	6858554	So if you select, you know, four, five, seven, then you see one through nine is the next digit.
6858574	6861316	But when you select six, it only goes zero through eight.
6862336	6863437	So interesting, huh?
6864177	6864678	DarkSakura
6884167	6889211	Well, how about something different, something in the Squeenix direction?
6889671	6891372	Remember we talked about Gun Loco?
6892473	6896056	Well, it turns out it's a game about a planet full of criminals.
6896616	6897657	They're all crazy.
6898238	6900459	Crazy, crazy, crazy criminals with guns.
6901580	6905643	And the world's sort of like an earthish ruin type place.
6906304	6908806	And there's different factions and they're always fightin'.
6910007	6914892	So it looks completely hilarious.
6915213	6918997	I think I would really, really like to play it.
6919037	6925804	All the characters were done by Kenny Wong and basically made toys of everything and then they scanned them into the game.
6925885	6928167	So that's how the design come about.
6928327	6928848	So that's pretty cool.
6930726	6933708	And then for Rock Band, we have the Disturbed Pack.
6935269	6939451	That's going to be on August 24th, a couple days from now.
6939971	6943133	The Disturbed Pack has Another Way to Die, Asylum, and The Animal.
6944013	6953518	And then there's Universal Motown Republic Rock Pack, which is Crash Kings, Mountain Man, The Veer Union Seasons, and We Are the Fallen, Bury Me Alive.
6954679	6973713	They're also, only one of those is available in Lego Rock Band And that is the Vera Union Seasons And lastly, the big Horkin grocery store chain in England called Tesco You've heard of them, I'm sure No, because they don't have them here Actually, they do Do they?
6974373	6980378	There's a company called Fresh and Easy That's a Tesco chain in the United States
6981292	6981392	Oh.
6982294	6983938	Still, I don't think I've ever been one, but okay.
6984218	6984919	Tiara told me about them.
6985982	6987505	Let's just be opening a couple in Sacramento.
6988550	6992872	But anyway, it's like a big grocery store chain.
6993032	6997934	Anyway, they are now going to be buying used games.
6999114	7002836	You will be paid in credit, and then you can buy whatever you need in the grocery store.
7004916	7010439	So basically they're saying, like for Red Dead Redemption, you'll get a 19-pound trade-in.
7011079	7012279	Mario Kart for Wii gets 19 pounds.
7012299	7014320	FIFA 2010 gets 12 pounds, that type of thing.
7016981	7025412	and then they're going to resell the stores at other outlets and already about 60 Tesco stores accept them
7027190	7028591	Everybody wants a piece of that industry.
7028951	7029412	I guess so.
7029592	7035016	Now when someone says they have to pick between video games and food, if money's hurting, they can literally... They can literally do that.
7035076	7039399	If I like, I had to give up, you know, Red Dead Redemption, but I got some Top Ramen.
7039739	7040099	There you go.
7040119	7040319	Awesome.
7041540	7043842	All right, let's get into some Twitter topics tonight.
7044182	7052868	Every week you guys submit us topics at www.twitter.com slash OLR, and we pick a few of our favorite topics and read through them here on the show.
7053508	7053609	And...
7054589	7056770	Sadly, I seem to be without my music tonight.
7056930	7057491	What did I do?
7059592	7060292	I broke it all.
7060853	7063494	Well, I guess Twitter topic's canceled because I don't have a theme song.
7063594	7064154	I blame Rob.
7064275	7064815	I blame Rob.
7066716	7067416	Live radio.
7067556	7070418	You just want to sing the theme song tonight?
7072299	7073320	Oh, thank God we're all saved.
7073420	7073680	All right.
7075781	7076922	Twitter.com slash OLR.
7080307	7083690	Let's see who tweeted us this week here.
7084811	7087013	Redertainment sends us a tweet.
7088194	7093859	It says, You mean a game so bad that it's kind of good?
7094720	7095861	Actually, I'll say this.
7095921	7096621	There really was.
7096661	7098503	There was a Rocky Horror Show game.
7098523	7099204	There was two of them.
7099704	7100245	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7116534	7122059	There was a CD-ROM based one in the mid-90s for one of the big UK revivals.
7123360	7127944	Back when full motion video was in every CD-ROM game, they actually had a Rocky Horror Show game there.
7127964	7130126	But it was released, I think, exclusively in the UK.
7130166	7131127	So I never played it.
7131587	7133009	I don't know if people out there did.
7133469	7134290	But that would be it.
7134570	7136552	What about a game so bad it's kind of good?
7137192	7141716	How about not taking the question so literally and a game so bad it's kind of good?
7143037	7147921	I think about Loki and how he talks about Driver 3 all the time, that it's so terrible that it's actually kind of fun.
7148781	7149522	Earth Defense Force 2017.
7149682	7154245	It's a very terrible game, but it's very fun.
7155506	7157427	I think back in the day for me it was Abydox.
7160029	7165432	I don't know if I can think of one that I really go, gosh, that game is so bad, but I love it for some reason.
7166213	7167794	Anything come to your mind, Alan, to think of?
7169690	7174173	I'm not sure if I'm thinking of terrible or just really difficult, but Battletoads?
7175974	7176595	I thought of one.
7176955	7177515	I thought of one.
7177915	7181278	A game that we actually played on end because it was so awful.
7181898	7182338	What's that?
7182538	7183479	Toshinden 3.
7185080	7186221	It had the butt monkey in it.
7188222	7191564	Seriously, it had this, like a baboon, so it had the big exposed butt.
7192245	7194126	And it would fly its butt at people.
7194806	7198349	And then there was this one guy who his taunt was shooting people.
7199850	7201612	He could just take damage off by taunting.
7202292	7203473	Just shoot, bang.
7203633	7207056	And it was so bad, and the voice acting was so horrible.
7207116	7214082	And even to this day, when I'm hanging out with Mystique and we see a monkey, we'll go, butt monkey dance, butt monkey dance.
7214363	7215464	Because he'd dance when he won.
7218302	7223046	TigerClaw, leave it to him to have the Google Foo skills to find more information.
7223486	7232192	The Rocky Interactive Horror Show game was released in March-April 1999 for the PC by OnlinePLC.
7232632	7238716	Similarly to the earlier CRL game, the player plays as Brad or Janet and must rescue their partner from the castle.
7239056	7247282	Unlike the older computer game, its gameplay was more puzzle-oriented and benefited from the added detail, graphics, and live video sequences that the PC could provide.
7248202	7249543	Was Frankenfurter in it though?
7249623	7255685	Because if Frankenfurter's not in it, I mean Tim Curry single-handedly makes that movie.
7256385	7256746	He does.
7258286	7263128	The screams of thousands of people when Frankenfurter first shows up in the movie tell me so.
7263828	7264349	Alright, anyhow.
7265209	7267790	Let's see other tweets that we have.
7267830	7269411	Twitter.com slash OLR.
7270251	7274393	Tigerclaw sends us a link about an Italian city that's pissed at Gran Turismo 5.
7275013	7276814	Now why would you be angry at Gran Turismo 5?
7277674	7282879	Well, apparently Siena is a city in Tuscany, Italy.
7283400	7292208	They're very unhappy that one of their, I guess, famous roads, the Piazza del Campo, is actually a race course in Gran Turismo 5's kart mode.
7292509	7293790	They want it removed in the game.
7294370	7299115	It's not that the road is in the game or the structures or what have you.
7299716	7300897	It's also...
7302765	7304025	I'm trying to see what it is here.
7305366	7309647	Sorry, when we get things from Twitter, we haven't had a chance to look at them in advance or whatever.
7311527	7314028	I guess because it's also partially a horse race.
7314688	7315168	Oh, I see.
7315268	7319309	The Piazza del Campo is also the name of a famous horse racing track.
7319709	7322570	So I guess they don't want people to kind of get confused over what's going on there.
7322930	7328475	So they've sent out a, quote, diplomatic request to Sony to resolve the matter.
7328895	7336581	This game's coming out very soon, though, so I don't know if it's going to be able to be fixed unless they patch it out because that's how they fix everything these days, right?
7339715	7340116	Let's see.
7341457	7343118	I'll read this one too from Tiger Claw.
7343238	7344620	We give everybody at least two tweets.
7345120	7346762	So Tiger Claw sends us this tweet.
7347242	7351646	Disney Online hits a traffic high with 36 million monthly visitors.
7351766	7352066	Wow.
7352447	7353508	And they're not... How much are on Facebook?
7355233	7356093	How much of that's on Facebook?
7356113	7358334	They don't really get their users through Facebook, do they?
7358655	7359895	But they do Club Penguin.
7360375	7363537	You've seen those Club Penguin cards at Target and all those other stores.
7363557	7364957	That's probably their biggest game there.
7365958	7369500	They also have Toontown Online, Disney Fairies, Pixie Hollow.
7369560	7371400	I didn't even know there was a Disney Fairies, Pixie Hollow.
7372061	7372561	There you go.
7372621	7374542	So lots and lots of games that Disney has.
7375682	7377403	They've hit quite a milestone there.
7377923	7378904	Never played one of them.
7379724	7380625	I love penguins, too.
7380685	7383126	I don't know why I've never played Club Penguin, but I just haven't.
7383846	7385947	DJ Blaziken sends us a variety of stories.
7386187	7388128	Some of them we're going to be talking about earlier or later.
7388988	7390549	But this one I don't think goes on our show roll.
7390569	7392030	This has to do with other Blizzard stuff.
7392410	7396071	Big things planned for Diablo 3 at this year's BlizzCon.
7396652	7400333	Apparently there is big Diablo 3 news coming out at BlizzCon this year.
7400693	7402414	It's going to be split into three games.
7403055	7403795	No, let's hope not.
7406256	7407816	I guess this is coming out of Gamescom.
7407856	7416759	It's the game's director, Jay Wilson, saying, quote, I can say that this BlizzCon, in terms of Diablo news, will be the biggest one that we've ever had.
7417119	7419300	Well, it's probably because that's the game they're going to focus most on.
7419340	7422621	Because by that point, we ought to know the release date for Cataclysm.
7423061	7424921	And it'll be out either just before or just after.
7424941	7428462	Did they even have BlizzCon back in the Diablo 2 days?
7428563	7429223	No, they didn't.
7429463	7431924	Of course it's going to be the one they've had the most Diablo days.
7431944	7433104	I don't know what the hell that means.
7433604	7437249	and I'm sure they're going to reveal another playable class in the game.
7437289	7440873	They say there's only going to be one more, a fifth class, and they've announced all the others.
7441634	7442055	Cheerleader.
7443577	7444097	Let's hope.
7444238	7447942	Maybe they'll release a peripheral for the keyboard like they had on WeCheer.
7448243	7448884	That would be great.
7450786	7451547	We'll see what happens.
7454093	7461284	Yo, what's really interesting though about that is that, you know, with StarCraft 2 having had the digital distribution day one, I bet Diablo 3 is going to have that too.
7461364	7465491	So I wonder if it's really going to have that big midnight launch or what have you.
7465611	7467434	I don't know.
7467514	7467995	Let's see.
7468115	7468596	Anyhow.
7470777	7475939	Oh dear, we're getting linked to this by Actdeft, and I just see furries in the title, so I'm worried about this.
7476419	7483222	He links this to a story from Kotaku that says, Microsoft Kinect supports furries, and it's got a video on it.
7484202	7485163	Do I want to see this?
7486643	7487524	We know what you're thinking.
7487544	7491285	Will Microsoft Kinect read your body when fully encased in a fursuit?
7493206	7495127	And again, this is coming from Kotaku, I guess.
7497850	7503172	Yes, and sure enough, somebody is dancing there in a full kitty costume there to Dance Central.
7505353	7508534	Thank you, Actdeft, for wasting 30 seconds of my life.
7508594	7509614	I will never be able to get back.
7509674	7517837	So at DragonCon over Labor Day weekend, they can, you know, they can yiff in the privacy of their hotel rooms or they can get their gaga on.
7520117	7522419	Yo, Bobby's going to DragonCon.
7522679	7524381	Bobby, I would like to request... I hope he's still listening.
7524421	7530526	Bobby, I would really like to request a full furry report on the furry scene at DragonCon.
7530706	7531047	Sound good?
7531447	7532188	Bring some Purell.
7535049	7536330	I'd say bring the candle, I saw.
7537751	7543956	Dark Kasuke sends us a tweet on Twitter saying that Star Wars Clone Wars open beta open today.
7544737	7545017	Really?
7545117	7545897	I did not know that.
7545957	7549941	A lot of these big games coming out the Christmas season, I guess, are having their betas open up.
7550241	7552322	What I want to know, when's the DC Universe one open up?
7552743	7553884	That's the one I really want to play.
7554604	7555225	Really bad.
7556631	7562493	And lastly, Alex P. Carson tweets us saying, Does anybody know the official name of the Super Mario version of M.I.A.
7562553	7565134	Paper Planes that was on the Afterbirth a while back?
7565674	7566954	Ooh, that's making me think.
7567374	7574236	There's a website that has tons of chiptunes, and I can't think of the name of it right now, but hopefully somebody in chat will remember.
7574816	7578558	And we found it on there, and I bet if you search for Paper Planes, you could find it.
7578758	7581999	There's some huge chiptunes website, and I can't remember the name of it.
7582019	7583219	Like, it totally escapes me right now.
7584218	7585659	Somebody in chat will remember what it is.
7586319	7588260	It's like it's just a bunch of homegrown stuff.
7588321	7591663	And if you like that, you'll probably like a lot of the stuff that's on there.
7592243	7594164	So hopefully somebody in chat will shout it out here soon.
7594204	7595445	If not, I'll Google it in a minute.
7595485	7595985	I'll find it.
7597346	7598427	Let me Google that for you.
7598967	7600488	All right, that's going to do it for Twitter topics tonight.
7600508	7604911	If you want to send us tweets in the future, twitter.com slash OLR.
7605311	7608833	In the meantime, while I try to figure out what song that was, Loki.
7610051	7619859	Yes, this week both the Guitar Hero Warriors of Rock tracklist and Rock Band 3 tracklist were revealed.
7620619	7625223	And it's interesting because there's definitely a lot of stuff to go over.
7626123	7654534	so let's start off with Guitar Hero Warriors of Rock and there's going to be 93 tracks I'm not going to go through all of these but some of the ones I thought were interesting Rush 2112 they have all 7 parts of it that's kind of neat I guess let's see what were some of the ones that stood out to me Rammstein they've got a song from them looks like Wade Mann's Heil
7655434	7657935	Let's see here.
7658295	7661516	REM, Losing My Religion, Queen, Bohemian Rhapsody.
7661736	7663157	Of course, both games have that.
7663517	7664497	It's an awesome song.
7666118	7672720	By the way, there was a Queen slot machine that I played in Reno and it's the most amazing gambling device I've ever played.
7674740	7681703	The bonus round, it lets me pick a Queen song and then the game plays itself for free for like a minute while I sit there and listen to Radio Gaga.
7681723	7682343	It's amazing.
7683904	7684567	That's cool.
7685852	7688966	Let's see, what other songs on here?
7691015	7718824	they've got like actually a bunch of just a bunch of everything there's just about one song from each artist on here some of the ones I actually recognize let's see of course you know they have Deep Purple Burn the Creedence Clearwater Revival Fortunate Son which was a download content from Rock Band 2 Foreigner feels like the first time um
7720470	7725259	By the way, did you see that video where they confessed up that the Rock Band 3 leak was real, basically?
7725560	7729347	Yeah, they have the Rock Band full tracklist behind them.
7729928	7730670	Yeah, that was funny.
7732290	7733471	Anyway, so yeah, lots of stuff.
7733491	7734472	The list is out there.
7734492	7737954	Definitely worth checking out because it looks pretty cool.
7738755	7740716	And then, of course, Rock Band 3.
7741537	7744299	We've got... Let's see here.
7745560	7746981	Lots of things from there.
7748081	7755927	Their track list is a little bit smaller, but of course you get all the download content from Rock Band 2 and all the tracks from that and anything else you pretty much have bought.
7756427	7756527	Um...
7757995	7764068	So, starting off with that, they have Amy Winehouse in Rehab, but I didn't really think of that as a rock song, but okay.
7767458	7771320	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7792833	7809179	Leonard Skinner, Free Bird Marilyn Manson, The Beautiful People Ozzy Osbourne, Crazy Train I know they had another Rammstein song on here, Du Host Not Pussy Is it in German?
7810319	7814541	If it's in German that would be great I have to sort of digress
7815666	7815987	Why not?
7816027	7817008	That's what we do here on the show.
7817048	7828043	One of the E3 trips, all the DDR Freak moderators got together and went to the Korean karaoke place and Doohast was on there and we were all singing Doohast in our worst Rammstein German voices.
7828464	7829585	Doohast mich!
7830026	7830366	You know.
7831027	7831288	All that.
7831308	7831688	It was great.
7831868	7832069	Nice.
7833426	7854996	um no please don't stand so close to me they also had uh i hate this song uh smash mouth walking on the sun uh the sounds living in america at least it's not that hey now you're an all-star oh i think that's already in there i think that was in lego rock band i hate that song um
7858157	7859938	Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, I need to know.
7860579	7862840	Curse of Fears, Everybody Wants to Rule the World.
7863741	7864501	Lots of cool stuff.
7864822	7871266	I'm just looking forward to actually being able to play a lot of these songs with the keyboard, which would be really sweet.
7871286	7875069	I really hope they go back and add keyboard support for some of the old classic download songs.
7875189	7878671	Yeah, I don't know if they're gonna, but it would be neat.
7880192	7881573	They really need to, just saying.
7882013	7884195	Of course, they have Deep Purple, Smoke on the Water.
7884855	7886817	Probably the better Deep Purple song, if you ask me.
7888075	7888996	All right.
7889036	7892418	By the way, just to answer that tweet from a few minutes ago, finally found the answer there.
7892439	7905269	We're using my Google Foo, and the listener's in chat room and found it already, but just for anybody else who's listening, the artist's name is CSLSX, and the website I was trying to think of, 8-Bit Collective, which is actually a really good website for a bunch of chiptunes.
7905629	7913815	It's 8, the number 8, not spelled out, actually the number 8, bc.org, and you can get all these NES chiptunes.
7923530	7927200	Actually, that was the worst possible clip of the song I could play for you guys, but it's not bad.
7927742	7928243	Go check it out.
7930097	7932559	THQ is putting out a new game tablet for the Wii.
7957997	7959218	It's called U-Draw.
7959539	7962282	It's a 4x6 inch tablet and it's going to be coming out for the Wii.
7962862	7966506	It will be coming out for $70 and it comes with U-Draw Studio.
7966907	7969650	It's a drawing, coloring, and art based video game.
7969990	7971592	Which I think is kind of cool.
7971672	7973154	It's Mario Paint basically.
7973214	7975616	And how long have we been saying they need to do Mario Paint on the Wii?
7976357	8001441	THQ is kind of doing it the way it ought to be done and what I love too is that one of the promotional shots here for the game is somebody who has drawn wait for it I'm trying to bring it up here in studio they've actually drawn on the screen oh damn it's a unicorn somebody drew a unicorn I was going to say a butt but unicorn works too I'm wondering if there wouldn't be some way that they're going to make an adapter to use it on the PC or something because it's definitely cheaper than buying just use a bluetooth adapter
8003201	8010447	In the end though, I mean, I paid $400 for my tablet and I can use Photoshop.
8011868	8013849	But Jamie, can you draw that bitch in Unicorn?
8014190	8015611	I could draw that Unicorn right now.
8016751	8023577	And I just got a hate on Apple a little bit, but the fact that the Wii has a proper tablet means that it's more of an iPad than the iPad is.
8026599	8027139	There you go.
8027199	8028460	I'm drawing a Unicorn right now.
8028840	8029161	Yay.
8030161	8030242	Um...
8031801	8032382	Actually, you know what?
8032562	8035164	We've been needing new album art for Orange Lounge Radio.
8035224	8036806	And I'm still waiting on this picture.
8036826	8039548	Well, I think it should be... You took one of me like years ago.
8039608	8043572	Anyway, I think we should just have a giant unicorn in the album art.
8043932	8050919	Speaking of unicorns, and I know I'm a little bit behind in times because I used to check their YouTube feed every now and then.
8051559	8053561	They have a new Charlie the Unicorn.
8053621	8055223	Except it's not Charlie the Unicorn, it's...
8055783	8065730	Charlie T Unicron and it's like these remixed versions of the Charlie Unicorn episodes and it was hilarious because they burned down the forest
8068482	8069382	Candy Mountain.
8070022	8070463	All right, anyway.
8071303	8072503	Some other games that are coming out.
8072723	8075664	That's not the only game coming out is the Mario Paint-ish clone.
8076104	8083547	UDraw will also be getting launch games Pictionary, because, you know, we've got to have more of the board games on the Wii, and Dude's Big Adventure.
8083607	8086187	That's D-O-O-D, like doodle.
8087088	8087428	Dude.
8087928	8089048	Dude's Big Adventure.
8089408	8091549	It's a world where coloring books come to life.
8092170	8099032	Apparently it's heavily inspired by the game Drawn to Life, which was also a THQ game, so they're just kind of getting themselves there.
8099852	8102772	I'm sure the next Drawn to Life game will support this as well.
8103533	8103953	We'll see.
8103973	8105073	There's your damn unicorn.
8105913	8106373	Yay!
8106893	8113155	I can't hold the pen very well to... I can't hold my stylus very well to control my... Can you put a picture of that up on OrangeLaunchRadio.com?
8113175	8113395	Sure.
8114375	8114895	Alright, awesome.
8114955	8115635	I'll try to make it look better.
8116415	8116635	Okay.
8118576	8118836	Awesome.
8119150	8119950	So yeah, UDraw.
8119970	8120351	I don't know.
8120411	8122032	Is anyone in here interested in UDraw?
8122052	8125453	I guess DarkSakura made a pretty good case for it if it would work on the PC.
8126154	8126374	Nope.
8126694	8128035	Yeah, I'm not really interested either.
8128075	8129075	But I do want an iPad.
8131877	8137019	I think a lot of dinner parties have ended in divorce due to bad rounds of Pictionary.
8137500	8139881	And I'm glad that that experience can now come to the Wii.
8139981	8140941	To a whole new generation.
8141061	8141262	Yeah.
8141322	8141822	That'll be fun.
8143687	8148589	DarkSakura, I hate to tear you away from unicorn drawing, but there is more gaming news to be talked about tonight, correct?
8148829	8149549	The Doctor!
8151230	8153731	Doctor Who, there's going to be a third game.
8154972	8155132	Ooh.
8156012	8158954	Well, a third episode of Doctor Who, the adventure games.
8159834	8188759	this one's called TARDIS and you get to fly the TARDIS it'll be out on the 27th of August and the whole thing is that you have to explore the entire TARDIS and the TARDIS is freaking big remember, it's bigger on the inside and then you can fly the TARDIS so that's pretty cool you know, it's basically overcoming 40 years of what's it like to pilot the TARDIS in one game
8190615	8192857	Although really, the TARDIS is meant to be piloted by six people.
8192978	8195160	It should be a bullet hell game featuring the TARDIS.
8195720	8197322	The TARDIS can't shoot anything.
8198143	8199284	That sounds retardous.
8201246	8210196	Anyway, this one's featuring the 11th Doctor being Matt Smith and Amy Pond played by Karen Gillan, so pretty cool.
8211826	8214131	and it's free for all you people in the UK.
8214211	8214972	That's the best part.
8215072	8216575	Oh yeah, don't we have to pay for it though?
8216595	8221405	Because the Brits get it subsidized with their television tax or whatever but we have to actually pay for it, huh?
8221625	8222847	Yeah, we don't have TV tax.
8224701	8226482	I mean, great that we don't have TV tax.
8226862	8231866	Although Comcast kind of sends me a TV tax bill every month, but I guess that's a whole other issue.
8232206	8234008	You know I am going to be ditching cable TV though.
8235609	8242414	Well, with an HD receiver, I can just go get a good HD antenna for $50 and I can get my basic channels, which is all I watch on cable.
8242734	8244436	So why am I bothering?
8245296	8246978	Although I will say cable internet is where it's at.
8247878	8250881	My internet with them has actually gotten way faster recently.
8251201	8252001	Now I'm getting about...
8254141	8254621	I forgot the sparkles.
8270194	8273058	I did notice a shit ton of new HD channels.
8273178	8279687	I watched six hours of Ninja Warrior straight one of these days because I had to wake up with Joshua.
8280167	8281970	He didn't want to go to sleep and I couldn't change it.
8281990	8283271	He didn't want to watch Ninja Warrior.
8283532	8284393	I watched Ninja Warrior.
8284413	8285835	I watched like three seasons of it.
8286435	8286895	out over here, but
8315789	8326726	now not so much just because I don't think I have the Japanese one to compare it to anymore the Japanese Iron Chef with the food TV Julie Chan is a judge a lot on Iron Chef America and I love Julie Chan just saying
8330050	8331071	Wait, what are we talking about now?
8332753	8333533	You're ditching cable.
8333593	8334614	The Doctor Who game.
8334774	8335195	That was it.
8335215	8335875	We got to the end of it.
8335915	8336916	So it's all you, Loki.
8337376	8337777	I'm sorry.
8338137	8340739	It was all these different tangents and I forgot which one.
8340799	8342361	I see you shopping on eBay over there.
8342401	8342841	It's all good.
8343001	8344042	Yeah, I know.
8344723	8345583	I don't even know what I'm looking for.
8345603	8346604	I'm just looking.
8347525	8348226	Because that's what I do.
8349147	8353572	One of the things that's kind of funny, we were talking a little bit about different systems being hacked.
8354013	8363886	Well, something else that Microsoft had hoped wouldn't have been hacked, but it was, was the brand new Xbox 360 system, the S Slim, whatever the hell you want to call it.
8364346	8387246	Apparently, the mod chip creation group Team Executor has been working closely with Team Jungle, who has created dry firmwares for the original Xbox 360 systems, and Commodore Forever, also responsible for firmwares for those systems and hacking DVD drives.
8388767	8398030	and now they have figured out a way to be able to patch the DVD-ROM on those new Slim systems to play backups.
8398330	8403152	So yes, they have now created a new hacked firmware for that.
8406473	8409074	They just keep trying, but they find ways around it.
8410634	8413595	But again, if you go online with it, baninated, right?
8414666	8429792	Um, I'm not sure, because I would assume, yes, eventually you'll probably get banned, but the newer firmwares nowadays, they have Light Touch and stuff like that, are apparently really stealthy, like, it's very hard to detect them, so...
8431312	8431632	Maybe?
8432172	8432493	I don't know.
8432573	8434053	I would assume eventually, yes.
8434673	8440276	But then again, I have a system at my work that was supposed to be modded, and it hasn't been banned at all.
8440456	8442736	Then again, we've not played one burned game on it.
8442877	8448059	We just actually... It's funny, I bought it to replace another modded system, and that's when we decided, hey, you know what?
8448319	8450900	Let's just play some normal Grand Theft Auto games instead of the modded ones.
8451960	8455201	We will be playing the modded ones again, but we're not modifying our drive firmware.
8455221	8456802	We're just doing disk swaps so that...
8457242	8462571	Even if they did detect that we were playing a modded game, when they look at the system, the drive's not modded.
8463533	8464254	They can't ban me!
8465255	8469723	Well, they can, but I would have a fighting chance.
8473266	8473566	Alright.
8474606	8479188	You haven't had the opportunity to play around with one of the new 360 models, right?
8479528	8480428	I don't really care.
8480568	8486530	I mean, it's neat that they changed the way it looks, and I like how it makes little noises and stuff when you click on the buttons.
8487471	8497094	And apparently there's some way... Now they're going to have the new sim system with the Halo stuff, and it's going to have some different sound effects for that.
8497134	8497754	That's kind of neat.
8498294	8499515	But, yeah, I mean...
8500595	8500835	I don't know.
8500855	8502396	It's like I wouldn't need one of these.
8503417	8504818	But I don't know.
8504838	8507099	If someone gives one to me, I'm not going to turn down.
8508140	8508420	All right.
8508860	8511782	Well, do you like to cut in line at big trade shows?
8512182	8517166	Or I guess not necessarily a trade show, but big conventions and have everybody hate you?
8517886	8521488	Well, here you have your opportunity if you are a member of the Gun Club.
8522109	8525591	It's Electronic Arts, one of their little promotional clubs.
8525931	8552720	They actually are running a promotion right now where you got an email And if you want, you can skip the line to see Dead Space 2 at Penny Arcade Expo If you have a copy of the email That's right, you can skip the line with a printout of the email And Penny Arcade Expo is coming up in a couple weeks That same Labor Day weekend that we're thinking of doing a long show And there you go, you print out the email Now, why hasn't somebody just put the email online And then you just mass print it and then go Maybe there's like a barcode on it or something we're not seeing, I don't know
8553180	8553620	Probably.
8553821	8555262	No, I don't think that's the case at all.
8555282	8559545	I think it's just people don't want to do that so that, you know, the line for that is really long.
8559585	8563428	Well, it's going to have the same line anyway, you know.
8563808	8564348	Exactly.
8564608	8565389	And you know what?
8565509	8569572	And it does suck, but then again, it's their booth space that they paid for.
8569632	8570873	They can do whatever the hell they want.
8571013	8573554	It's a strange precedent to be setting.
8574154	8581616	The only weird oddity about it for me is that, and I made a big mistake calling it a trade show earlier because it's not, but PAX is more of a convention.
8581816	8585958	And I always thought one of the things that was supposed to kind of separate it is that everybody was on equal footing.
8586578	8588418	Media doesn't get special treatment there.
8588458	8591399	You're not supposed to be doing all these media appointments and things.
8591579	8595121	That's what E3 is for, even though, especially the years that E3 went...
8596941	8598001	Thanks for watching!
8613647	8617389	But of course, you know, again, it's this company, their email list, they can do what they want.
8617429	8619051	They're just trying to pimp the service, the gun club.
8619071	8622573	They're trying to pimp it to make it have some value so that people can sign up for it.
8622953	8624314	I don't remember if it costs anything.
8624354	8632979	I think it's just, I know you, like, for example, if you buy that Battlefield Ultimate, you know, Battlefield Bad Company 2 Ultimate Edition or whatever, you get membership into the gun club.
8633019	8636862	I don't remember if it costs anything initially to sign up or whatever.
8637182	8641725	But you get, like, you know, into the Medal of Honor beta early and stuff like that.
8642145	8646988	So it's little tidbits of that kind of thing that are supposed to... I guess they're making it worthwhile.
8647789	8649850	But I don't know.
8650030	8650811	Like I said, they're a booth.
8650831	8651811	They can do whatever the hell they want.
8652712	8657655	Toagak in our chatroom at chat.orange.com says, I like the whole we don't care if you are media stuff.
8657956	8658856	Believe it or not, me too.
8659477	8660998	And I wish they did the same thing at E3.
8661418	8668462	I know that sounds weird because I can get media credentials for E3, but I kind of like it when everybody's on the same footing.
8668482	8668923	But E3, you can't...
8669343	8673584	I can't see E3 anymore without planning it out six months in advance.
8673624	8686368	Even if you do get media credentials, it still doesn't matter because they basically look at you, they're like, oh, well, you're not IGN or 1UP or whatever, so we don't know who you are, so we don't care.
8687668	8688368	So it doesn't matter.
8689169	8695070	It's because a lot of the marketing people behind video games don't play video games and know nothing about video games.
8695090	8697571	There's so many of them out there that just don't
8699117	8700959	They don't even know the product that they're selling.
8701299	8702260	Oh yeah, I know that.
8702360	8709787	I deal with a lot of corporate sales reps from these companies that are talking about the games coming out, and I start asking them questions about stuff, and they're like, I don't know, I don't play games.
8710488	8712930	It's like, you know, you don't even know your own product?
8712990	8713771	I mean, come on.
8715873	8716814	It's pretty astounding.
8717574	8718375	Kind of sad, though.
8720076	8720217	But...
8720959	8725103	We just have to support those companies that, you know, know what they're doing.
8725323	8727965	Just like Konami, they don't like to invite us anymore to things.
8728025	8730247	But I understand they're not in San Francisco anymore.
8730627	8731368	But so what?
8731408	8735291	You know, you can at least send the damn invite and if we can't make it, that's not a big deal.
8735512	8737433	The DDR thing was public and I thought that was great.
8739255	8739415	Yeah.
8739555	8740316	That was a great way to do it.
8740536	8740916	Exactly.
8741177	8742658	Let all the people who really want to see it go see it.
8744144	8746645	Alright, anyhow, let's open up the mailbag.
8747065	8747585	Yay!
8747666	8754348	Every week you guys send us emails here at mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com We select a few of our favorites and read them here on air.
8754628	8759170	Mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com Looks like our mailbag's very full from having a week off.
8759450	8760511	I'm not reading all of them.
8762652	8764434	Don't be butthurt if you don't get your email read.
8764614	8773742	Basically, if it was one asking us to advertise usernames or asking us about advertising or asking us about those types of things, we'll be replying to you offline.
8774422	8776384	Okay.
8776424	8777105	First one up.
8777365	8778746	I can't say anything.
8783430	8787892	Haseo, Sumi, Ragawa, Hay, or Plissken as it was in my last email.
8787912	8789333	Yes, it's a Metal Gear Solid reference.
8790774	8792735	If Rob still hates Justin Bieber, have him watch this.
8792835	8793175	Whatever.
8793796	8794156	I'm sorry.
8794636	8796657	It's a video that I haven't pulled up.
8797378	8800439	Oh, everybody's... It's probably him getting hit with a water bottle.
8800880	8800980	Oh.
8802060	8803601	I saw the keyboard cat version of that.
8803921	8804141	Yeah.
8804722	8807443	And DarkSakura, if you still love Doctor Who, I have a video for you.
8807543	8808984	And I pulled it up and I'll watch it later.
8809044	8810685	It's the Mighty Morphin Dalek Rangers.
8812273	8822163	And on to non-Bieber stuff, um, okay, I tried to download a shady copy of Bleach Heat The Soul 6 for a Japanese game site, but for some reason it keeps saying corrupted or unsupported data.
8822264	8823004	Any suggestions?
8823745	8824366	Punctuation?
8824666	8825767	Um, no, I'm kidding.
8826148	8831874	Um, I would say, um, check your region.
8832474	8832655	What?
8833355	8833896	What was the question?
8834833	8840504	It downloaded a copy of Bleach Hate the Soul 6 from a Japanese game site.
8841345	8843469	But it says corrupted or unsupported data.
8844050	8846114	Is that through an emulator or through a console?
8846335	8846916	It didn't say.
8848311	8849092	He downloaded it?
8849372	8850393	Give us more details, dude.
8850413	8851433	You get what you pay for.
8853975	8854836	Redownload it.
8855016	8855416	I don't know.
8855516	8860019	If it's a PC game, then it sounds like it's just a corrupted download and you have to redownload it.
8860400	8867825	If you're downloading a pirated version of a game of some sort, perhaps you need to burn it at a lower speed.
8868185	8872868	If you're pirating a current game, I don't think we can really help you.
8873028	8874950	You're not supposed to be doing that naughty-naughty.
8875390	8879493	If this is a game I don't recognize from like 10, 15 years ago, they don't make anymore.
8879513	8880274	It's relatively new.
8880294	8880834	It's Bleach.
8881034	8882976	Well then, we can't help you.
8883516	8884557	I think it's a PC game.
8884597	8885758	It sounds like it's a PC game.
8886799	8889281	If you bought it legitimately, then call the people who made the game.
8889301	8890121	They can answer.
8891082	8891802	He said shady.
8893023	8893624	Naughty, naughty.
8893904	8897106	And third, I would like to thank Rob for his advice on an earlier episode.
8897187	8897867	What you said helped.
8897907	8900349	I told my friend, but not family for certain reasons.
8900749	8902090	And I'm currently dating someone.
8902210	8902891	Once again, thanks.
8903610	8905250	Oh, I'm glad to hear things worked out.
8905751	8907951	I remember that email.
8908111	8909072	So, good.
8909152	8910072	I'm really, really glad to hear it.
8911252	8912873	And thank you, DarkSakura, for reading my email.
8912913	8914013	And if you didn't, what the hell?
8914193	8914753	Well, fine.
8914793	8915133	Thank you.
8915713	8918954	Thanks, as always, your loyal listener, Haseo Sumirogawa.
8920054	8921975	Well, I'm very glad.
8921995	8924816	I hope my headache hasn't made me too grumpy when reading it.
8925916	8926776	Oh, good lord.
8928657	8929737	Long email!
8932150	8933210	Helping Ake Ripper.
8933750	8935751	Might be the longest mail in OLR history.
8936211	8937111	I don't know, it might be.
8938711	8941412	Good morning everyone, this is the other Swede, Jiditz, writing in.
8942052	8947653	I usually rant about something or comment on things that were brought up during the last live show, but not this time.
8948413	8955055	During episode 376, which is the show before the previous one, Ake Ripper called in and told us of his angst and how Blizzard had wronged him.
8955795	8970460	seeing as that episode went up kind of late I didn't have time to listen to the episode before the next one aired and couldn't share my knowledge and experience when it comes to activating and playing Starcraft 2 all that is about to change so hold on to your socks and put your pants back on because it's what?
8971120	8976522	because it's time for a story of epic proportions fills the brim with angst I have to put my pants back on?
8978462	8983164	yeah because Rob's been sitting here pantsless the whole time I'm comfortable
8983996	8991698	Twas the morning of the 27th of July and the first thing I heard was the blaring of my alarm clock proclaiming it was the time for me to get up had approached.
8993158	8993638	Excuse me.
8995078	8996099	Didn't mean to do that.
8996259	8996819	Whatever.
8997579	9003820	With slow steps, I went up to the kitchen to prepare my breakfast, which on this specific day consists of two slices of toast and a cup of coffee.
9004380	9006621	The perfect combination of breakfast items, if you ask me.
9007061	9012522	After gulping down my coffee, I went to feed Gullen, my polar bear cub, and then... Polar...
9013122	9014524	Oh my god, get to the point.
9014604	9017686	Like, I appreciated the storytelling, but... Hold on.
9018187	9019768	And then proceeded to get ready to leave the house.
9020228	9024672	Now, you may think I went up early to stand in line to get my copy of StarCraft II, but you were sorely mistaken.
9025093	9029296	You see, during the summer break, I managed to acquire an ingrown nail on my big toe on both my feet.
9029696	9029857	Ow.
9030337	9036803	This made walking overall quite painful, so I promptly got in touch with my doctor, who had a spot open during the 27th of July, StarCraft II day.
9037663	9045510	After a swift drive to the doctor's office and later an extra 20 minutes of waiting, I finally get placed atop one of those odd beds they have at the hospital and the doctor arrives.
9045850	9046011	Oh lord.
9046031	9047932	Jamie Summers is not your LiveJournal client?
9063426	9064087	No, I'm not.
9064107	9068013	And I feel really bad about your ingrown toenails, dude.
9068895	9069436	You know what?
9072481	9073222	Get a live journal.
9073262	9076207	I think Alan's making a really good point there.
9077853	9079855	I feel like an ass now, I'm sorry, that was really mean.
9079875	9084280	No, I mean, I'm just, I'm not trying to be rude, but it's a three hour show, not ten.
9085121	9087383	We could read this email during the Labor Day show.
9087463	9090266	I'm gonna read what I want to read out of it.
9090687	9090927	Fine.
9091247	9094231	After all the crap with the doctor, paraphrasing of course,
9096468	9098209	I wondered how I could get the damn game.
9098650	9100952	I thought I could get it at home, so I went home.
9101352	9102973	I'm paraphrasing now, okay?
9103354	9103714	Thank you.
9105335	9115724	He turned it on, started Firefox, pulled out the credit card, and then Blizzard wanted him to pay 60 euros, which is about 589.80 Swedish kronor, which is 77 bucks for the digital purpose.
9115744	9118166	At the local store, it's 399 kronor, which is 52 dollars.
9125211	9130217	So, um, to buy a physical copy, it cost him 20 bucks cheaper to go get the physical copy.
9130718	9131259	So he did that.
9132360	9133521	Um, blah blah blah blah blah.
9135223	9137787	Gonna install it, gonna play, no.
9138668	9142112	Okay, now this is where I'm gonna read the email again, because I'm pretty down into it now.
9142762	9143583	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
9166938	9172582	I emailed Blizzard support explaining my problem, what I had tried, and that I would love some information on what I was doing wrong.
9172622	9180128	Within six hours, I'd gotten a reply that said they had fixed the problem, and the following attempt to play StarCraft II was successful, and it was beautiful.
9181529	9188414	Alright, story time is over, but this email isn't, so straighten up your backs and get ready for GDOT's indie game of the century.
9190076	9190656	There's codes.
9191136	9191757	There's codes.
9193596	9194477	Oh, sweet, codes?
9195297	9197999	Oh, are we supposed to read the entire email and then let the codes for the reward?
9198019	9200620	Oops, I've been giving this guy a hard time.
9200660	9203442	ToyGakInChatRoom says, Control-F, point.
9210914	9219580	My friend who happens to be the developer finishes Xbox indie game Seaside Racing a couple weeks ago and is now up for sale on Xbox Live Marketplace for only 80 Microsoft points.
9220040	9229927	Seaside Racing is a stylistic physics-based kart racer made by a single person and this currently features three maps, Xbox avatar implementation, and up to 8-player multiplayer.
9230427	9231348	There's trailers up here.
9231928	9232829	I'll link it in the chat room.
9235531	9237172	He has four codes to give away.
9238213	9242776	So we are going to be giving away codes later on.
9243016	9246219	Maybe we'll post them on Twitter and Facebook to some fans later in the week.
9247300	9249581	I will actually save this email then.
9251243	9252504	But I might keep a code for myself.
9254338	9254938	I'll play it.
9255298	9257339	Big thanks to DarkSakura for reading this long email.
9257479	9258099	Um, kind of.
9259220	9259420	Oops.
9259480	9262281	It's actually just over a thousand words and thanks to the rest of our crew.
9262321	9263902	I promise my next email won't be this long.
9263982	9264522	P.S.S.
9264562	9265582	The polar bear wasn't real.
9265982	9267143	This is Jeedit signing off.
9267523	9272105	To tell you a story, Jeedit, I would have believed the polar bear and I'll tell you why.
9273785	9278847	When Lord Byron, you know, the poet, went to college, he was not allowed to have a dog.
9278887	9280828	The rules were no dogs allowed on campus.
9281528	9282989	But it did not say anything about a bear.
9283959	9284820	So he had a pet bear.
9286221	9287161	I think when he went to Cambridge.
9288162	9288602	True story.
9288823	9289343	True facts.
9291605	9293246	So the polar bear could have been possible.
9293746	9295848	I wanted to know what kind of toothpaste he used.
9296108	9300772	I could have used what type of magazines in the doctor's office.
9302253	9304014	I just don't think your email was detailed enough.
9304334	9307677	I couldn't really get a sense of the situation.
9309678	9310739	And dire urgency.
9310759	9310839	Okay.
9312631	9314274	I moved it to the inbox.
9314495	9317541	I'm glad to hear that emailing Blizzard support was a great option.
9318743	9321989	I just want to say though, like you could have condensed that down to Twitter size.
9322450	9324194	Tell Ake Ripper to email them.
9326681	9327601	Move to inbox.
9327922	9328622	Here's some codes.
9329822	9330483	Just saying.
9331643	9333104	No, I'm giving this poor guy a hard time.
9333324	9333624	I'm sorry.
9333644	9335025	We do appreciate the email.
9335405	9335845	I'm sorry.
9335865	9336605	I'm sorry.
9336625	9337646	I paraphrased.
9337766	9338206	I promise.
9338306	9340107	I did read it and it was entertaining.
9340887	9341468	That's true.
9341828	9342688	I want a polar bear now.
9343608	9344729	That's going to replace the pony.
9346553	9349295	You know when I go to a restaurant and someone says, is there anything else you'd like?
9349515	9350496	I say, a pony.
9350837	9351817	Now I'm going to say a polar bear.
9351937	9352318	Thank you.
9352418	9354640	Yeah, because one time you ended up getting a coney.
9355040	9357722	When you asked for a pony, the waitress brought you a coney dog.
9358103	9359083	And I laughed.
9359884	9361245	I took it home to Dan, though, and he ate it.
9361305	9362426	And you totally felt guilty.
9362466	9366349	Like, the waitress was going to take it back going, oh, you were trying to be funny.
9367050	9367790	Oh, I see.
9368131	9369252	People usually do laugh.
9369272	9369772	Yeah.
9371428	9373891	Blame the Sonic intercom speaker.
9374871	9377354	By the way, one of the Sonics in Roseville closed, just so you know.
9377714	9381138	I know the one that was built into the... What's up with that?
9382082	9383123	Where was the other one?
9383403	9394328	There's one over on, I mean, I'm sure our international listeners, especially those like in Sweden and Mexico really appreciate this talk, but I think it's over on like Paradise Grove or whatever that street's called.
9395048	9397089	You know what I'm talking about?
9397889	9398029	Off 65?
9398070	9398370	No.
9398550	9402151	Go up 65 and there's like a Pleasant Grove.
9402271	9402652	That's it.
9402972	9403592	Pleasant Grove.
9403612	9404392	I think I've been to that one.
9404853	9405373	That's where it is.
9406854	9407534	Over by Walmart.
9408757	9410380	by Walmart.
9410500	9411121	We went there once.
9411141	9412744	I think it was the first day you ever met Alan.
9413966	9414587	Yes, it was.
9415048	9416951	And we had tater tots and it was magical.
9418694	9419215	Next up!
9420444	9423325	Hey guys, this is... I'm not going to read your name.
9423365	9423746	Sorry, dude.
9423766	9424746	I don't care if you put your name in there.
9424786	9425326	I'm not reading it.
9425727	9426407	Kidwhatever.
9427007	9428708	It's been a while since I've talked to you.
9428788	9438193	I'm not sure if you've kept up on the money-related music activities I've been doing, but I have some new releases on Discord Music that I think you'll want to post about.
9438213	9441094	So please get back to me with an email address where I can send you some press material.
9441735	9442595	Pimp my music.
9445617	9446097	Send them here.
9447608	9448908	You have to email him to do that.
9448988	9451889	He's probably not actually listening to the show.
9452949	9453510	Was he on it?
9453530	9455350	Didn't we have him on years and years ago?
9455570	9457491	Yeah, but he's probably listening.
9457891	9458291	Well, hi.
9458471	9460812	Well, dude, if you're listening, email.
9463912	9467413	Troy, just sent a simple message.
9467953	9469854	Dan plus OLR equals awesome.
9470474	9471714	Let's not inflate Dan's ego too much.
9471735	9473335	He's not here anyway, so I ain't gonna tell him.
9474904	9475444	Stop it!
9475604	9478066	I'm trying to keep him in his place.
9479246	9480507	And you are inflating his ego.
9480547	9483228	We need some DanSucks emails, is what we need.
9483288	9484409	We need him to get some hate mail.
9484449	9485609	No, because then I'll cry.
9485669	9486710	Everybody gets hate mail.
9486770	9487450	I married him.
9487950	9489691	Only I'm allowed to say he sucks.
9490011	9490311	You know what?
9490391	9491932	I'm going to write an email to the show right now.
9491952	9492012	Rob.

9502317	9502377	Rob.
9502397	9502457	Rob.
9504714	9505344	Ooh, this is cool.
9505364	9505993	It's from Roboba.
9507628	9508909	And it's actually someone I'm a fan of.
9509649	9513571	Writer Peter David posted on his blog that he is writing the Tron comic book.
9514191	9516732	I'm not sure if it will be released as a graphic novel.
9517152	9521054	It probably will as it catches up on the story behind Tron Legacy.
9521514	9523735	I'm not a fanboy much, but I am a Tron fanboy.
9523955	9528737	I actually like Peter David and I've read some of his Star Trek novels.
9530258	9532279	And I think he wrote the novelization for Iron Man.
9533319	9536461	So it was... I like his writing a lot, so...
9537003	9537424	Tron 3D Preview
9554622	9556403	I didn't quite make that noise, but close.
9557063	9557783	Is that it for emails?
9557943	9558123	No.
9558563	9558703	No.
9558803	9560724	Like I said, we have a bunch, and I'm only reading a few.
9560864	9561124	All right.
9561964	9562804	Another one from Robaba.
9563364	9566885	Now that Microsoft announced Windows Phone 7, a near random thought came to mind.
9567245	9569046	Is Game Room meant for the mobile phone?
9569806	9572967	It also has a heavy emphasis on games in your live account.
9573427	9578188	I think they are smart to do this, since games would be one of the few things to rope people in.
9578249	9579329	You know, they actually...
9580409	9583152	What was Microsoft's, the Zune?
9584393	9588957	Weren't they supposed to have had Zune integration for Xbox Live?
9589077	9592340	Indie games, I think it was a rumor a while back that X and A would play on the Zune too.
9592400	9596544	Remember that thing at E3 where we sat on the big floor with the subwoofer built into it?
9596944	9597204	Oh, yes.
9597224	9599666	And it vibrated your butt every time the bass would go loud?
9599706	9599987	Yes.
9600127	9603690	And they had the phone integration thing and people pulling them around?
9604270	9604611	Oh, sort of.
9604631	9605311	For their big pitch?
9605331	9605832	Yeah, yeah.
9607585	9614007	I don't remember what it was called, but I guess Microsoft released a smartphone that came and went in like three months.
9614387	9615567	I posted it out on my Facebook.
9615728	9616388	Remember that?
9616588	9617968	Is that this Windows phone?
9620069	9625910	It had a very specific brand name, like a Zune, obviously, but that's their music player.
9626271	9627471	But there was a Microsoft phone...
9629275	9630415	that was out for two months.
9630516	9631396	I'd never even heard of it.
9631416	9633357	And they're like, oh, this is... Oh, the kin.
9633677	9634437	Yeah, that's it.
9634477	9634857	That's it.
9635057	9635677	I remember this.
9635778	9639659	Like, they had the girl on Facebook going around and meeting people and people were like, who the fuck are you?
9640559	9640799	Yeah.
9641920	9642180	Anyway.
9643841	9645761	Ooh, a hard question.
9647082	9647162	Okay.
9647182	9647382	Yay.
9649605	9653309	Wheel of Morality, turn, turn, turn, tell us the lesson that we should learn.
9670831	9675914	and today's moral is early to rise and early to bed may make a man wise but socially dead.
9677636	9678796	Read the damn email.
9679377	9683179	And as long as I've got some good time out of it I'm fine paying that.
9683540	9686962	Now I won't lie and say I haven't gotten some games by other means either.
9687482	9696969	Now to my problem I've recently bought a PS3 and am appalled that there isn't fire and blood protesting at these $60 price points for games.
9697709	9700231	As game companies whine when their games don't make tons of profit.
9701472	9707457	You know as well as I do that when Steam puts a game up for 50% off sale, it sells like hotcakes and the developer makes money.
9707957	9711941	Has there been any PS3 game developers that put their game up for 40 to 50 bucks?
9712441	9716004	I wonder if they would sell more and thus make more.
9717529	9731989	3D.GameHeroes was $39.99 maybe $49.99 but it was in that price range you talk about there I believe in America it sold $150k which isn't terrible but I don't know if it'll have a sequel
9732889	9733830	Actually for an Atlus game that's really good.
9733850	9740874	But it also came out around the same time as Lost Planet 2, Escape 3, Red Dead Redemption, Split Second Blur.
9741194	9743195	And that is also one game.
9743555	9745596	And I can't think of a whole lot that were cheaper.
9745636	9747077	I guess Super Street Fighter 2 was cheaper.
9747637	9748678	Yes.
9748738	9753541	It was also an upgrade to a game that you'd already paid $60 for before.
9754464	9758868	Well, now he's saying, I've included a link to the new PS3 USB hack that might be real.
9758888	9759868	Of course, we covered it earlier.
9760409	9764132	And to be truthful, at $60 a game, it is a little tempting.
9764152	9765172	What do you guys think about it?
9765653	9766954	Your loyal turtle in Philly?
9767054	9767654	Serious turtle.
9771477	9772077	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9789168	9790589	10-15 years ago without inflation.
9812034	9816275	So by the time the PlayStation 1, PlayStation 2 era came around, they actually dropped in price quite a bit.
9816715	9818976	But now they're slowly climbing back up to where they used to be.
9819916	9822456	Not that I'm necessarily saying it's justified, because you're right.
9822476	9826697	There's a lot of crap out there for $60 that really shouldn't be.
9827037	9830938	But again, what was I saying about the marketing people behind video games earlier?
9831559	9833899	That many of them... They don't play games.
9833919	9835159	Oh yeah, they don't play the games.
9835639	9837560	So everything to them is gold.
9839161	9849073	I think that gaming fandom at large, or at least this is how the corporations have kind of treated gaming fandom, is that they're very fickle and they have a very short attention span.
9849374	9852798	Once a game is older than three months, no one cares.
9853098	9856462	Like remember when I said buy StarCraft 2 six months after it comes out?
9857223	9877152	and it's like well no one's everyone's gonna have moved on by then you have to charge your 60 bucks because once the game is three months old if you haven't made your money back by then it's paying for hype no one's gonna care it's kind of like a movie though right movies are very similar if you don't make your box office back in several weeks then direct to DVD when everyone else buys it it becomes a cool hit yeah
9878908	9898492	so I think it has a lot to do with the analysts and like their margins of if this game doesn't sell this much past six weeks or whatever their benchmark is then yeah so they charge you 60 bucks for it people who don't play video games are ruining the gaming industry alright I have one last email
9899960	9900300	Are you ready?
9900621	9900821	Yes.
9901161	9903663	From Butcher.
9904564	9911130	Yo guys, I just recently got hooked on your show and I was very sad to not hear your angelic, LOL, voices last week.
9911770	9922760	Anyway, I'm emailing you wondering if you have any good PSP titles that you could suggest to me and other listeners as I am slowly getting tired of Monster Hunter 2, Dissidia, and Fireteam Bravo.
9923400	9924181	Two thirds, I guess?
9924401	9924481	Um...
9925442	9929451	I'll honestly go for almost anything aside from sports games, ew.
9929912	9933279	Thanks, and may the flying spaghetti monster bless you, Pro Butcher, a.k.a.
9933639	9934040	Raw Men.
9934080	9934421	Somebody.
9935563	9935984	Raw Men.
9938311	9939392	All hail his noodley goodness.
9940052	9941613	What was I going to say?
9943514	9948297	If you like Dissida, Final Fantasy 1 and 2 remakes are excellent on the PSP.
9948337	9953200	Going back to really old games, I think Luminous, the old puzzler, and its sequel, I think the sequel's good.
9953500	9958223	Some of the best puzzle games they ever put out on the PSP almost was like a reason to own the system.
9958803	9962326	I liked Every Extend Extra, which was another Mr. Gucci game.
9962346	9963926	I liked Papa Lacrosse for a good RPG.
9964227	9964427	Mm-hmm.
9965187	9984553	Loco Roco is a cutesy game if you like cutesy games um there's you know PSP has quite a few little highlights in there and a lot of the ports are surprisingly not bad like little big planet on PSP pretty good uh you might like 30 second game heroes since I was talking about the 3d dot game heroes the 30 second or half minute hero or whatever it's called is pretty good too it's fun
9984721	9985121	Kingdom Hearts PSP
10003086	10006210	And there should be more stuff coming out, I think, in the fourth quarter, of course.
10006770	10009874	If you like music games, DJ Max is out there.
10010154	10013238	And I like Rock Band Unplugged, but not everybody liked that.
10013278	10016541	But if you like your 2DX type games, DJ Max is a good alternative.
10017583	10020025	I think that's it for music games.
10021471	10021731	Yeah.
10023252	10026693	Alf in our chatroom is suggesting Hatsune Miku Project Diva.
10028794	10029654	I forgot about that one.
10029955	10031095	Good call.
10031135	10033116	Some of the PSP collections are really good too.
10033136	10034897	The Gradius collection was pretty awesome.
10035297	10036757	There's some pretty good collections of games.
10036797	10038618	Isn't there a Mega Man collection on PSP as well?
10038918	10039418	It's pretty cool.
10039679	10041079	No, there wasn't a Mega Man collection.
10041099	10045601	But there's Mega Man... Mega Man X remade to 3D.
10045921	10046601	That's what it is.
10046781	10047042	Yeah.
10047362	10050183	They also have the powered up Mega Man that was like the super deformed Mega Man 1.
10052037	10052298	All right.
10053059	10053579	Well, there you go.
10053659	10054400	Is that it for emails?
10054641	10055983	I thought there was a last minute.
10056003	10057144	You want me to refresh the inbox?
10057344	10058406	I think one more email.
10058466	10059147	It was from you.
10059608	10060028	Oh, okay.
10060469	10061871	You said you were sending it, Rob.
10062852	10063834	So I'm not checking it.
10064154	10065055	You're not going to read it?
10066553	10067354	I think you should read it.
10067454	10068395	I'm just so upset.
10068995	10069235	Fine.
10069536	10073219	I feel like... She's taking away my voice, everybody.
10073599	10076502	That does not fit with the theme of the show.
10076582	10081526	I know, this is a show where every gamer has a voice and I am not being heard.
10084228	10086530	Especially since you are a super game analyst.
10086710	10088312	I know, I'm a video game analyst.
10093598	10095399	DarkSakura just read it and she wants to die.
10096200	10097281	What's it say, DarkSakura?
10097921	10099002	I hate you all so much.
10100303	10102545	I want you all to get the hot shotgun bullets to die.
10104826	10109490	I wrote Dan sucks, LOL, but I spelled sucks, S-U-X, because I know she loves that.
10111081	10112442	That sounds like proper English to me.
10112502	10113483	I mean, sucks.
10113523	10115925	That's how it turns out on my phone when I text people.
10117126	10117426	Alright.
10118186	10118387	Ow.
10119407	10119928	You see this?
10120088	10121149	It's mine now.
10121289	10123110	No, it's landed in my yard.
10123170	10123731	It's mine now.
10123791	10125732	This is my... What the hell is it, Alan?
10125792	10126272	Thank you.
10126413	10128314	You're sleeping on the couch.
10128934	10129255	Alright.
10131256	10132717	This is definitely the time of the show.
10132737	10133918	I approve of Alan.
10133958	10134559	Thank you so much.
10134579	10138762	This is definitely the part of the show where we're going to get angsty with a segment we call the FUs of the Week.
10155578	10156799	F you to my head hurting.
10158199	10158880	And Rob.
10161461	10162101	You stink.
10162582	10163162	You sucks.
10164703	10165043	Loki.
10167924	10169445	I guess F you to lack of sleep.
10170946	10172326	The baby doesn't know better.
10172586	10174828	He just doesn't know what night and day is yet.
10176048	10178509	He also had trouble pooping.
10179310	10183512	Hopefully he is past that now because I hate trying to make him poop.
10184992	10185712	It's difficult.
10185732	10190434	Well, it's not difficult, but it's got to be embarrassing for him, but he doesn't know anything yet.
10190674	10192015	Tell Nelly to stop eating onions.
10193796	10195316	That has nothing to do with him not pooping.
10195756	10197137	You know, I'm really curious.
10197357	10199338	Eating onions will give babies constipation.
10199358	10201099	She doesn't breastfeed enough.
10201819	10203940	Are we going to get poop stories every week on OLR now?
10203980	10204600	That would be great.
10205360	10207181	Sure, I can tell you poop stories.
10207501	10209582	See, because he's constipated, so he can't go.
10209602	10210563	Is he still green?
10210863	10211523	You have to take...
10211943	10212784	Yeah, it's great.
10212984	10222654	So he has to have little suppositories put up there, and that doesn't really stay up there, but it triggers him to poop.
10223054	10225656	But he, this morning, he pooped like three times, so he's fine.
10226998	10227678	Congratulations.
10228499	10228779	Alright.
10229000	10233324	It's good for him, but he still grunts all night long and does his kung fu, so I don't know.
10233924	10236127	See, that's quite good for having him watch Ninja Warriors.
10237916	10239959	Alan, do you have any FUs?
10239999	10241200	Hopefully they don't involve poop.
10241320	10242622	His first word should be Hadouken.
10243863	10245425	Street fighter.
10245585	10251692	FU to salmonella, E. coli, and other invisible poop that hides in your food and makes you sick when you go on vacation.
10252333	10252813	Bad eggs?
10254455	10255156	Bad chicken, I think.
10257418	10258279	Maybe it was a bad egg.
10259358	10260019	I won $400 playing craps.
10260059	10260559	How did you do?
10280270	10280871	Dynafire.
10281911	10284914	No, I'm happy for my friends, but I'm sad for me.
10285635	10286876	That's what's really important, right?
10288277	10291080	Just a couple more stories for you guys, and then the Skype line.
10291100	10292361	We're going to take your phone calls.
10292581	10293302	Oh, God.
10294142	10294963	Loki, what do you got for us?
10295323	10296825	Don't sound too excited there.
10298206	10300987	So I have some news about Super Street Fighter 4.
10301487	10306810	Of course, the arcade version has a few empty slots available for some new characters.
10307410	10308711	And that's what they're going to get.
10308851	10315115	They're going to get some new characters that are going to be, I guess, exclusive to the arcade, at least for right now.
10316495	10319537	Of course, it doesn't say exactly what characters those are going to be.
10319837	10321358	I guess that is yet to be determined.
10321458	10323239	But there will be some new characters coming.
10325762	10326082	I wouldn't mind...
10342458	10342998	Rolento.
10344258	10345219	Also, what's her name?
10346039	10346519	Alima?
10346759	10347159	Alima?
10347539	10348359	Alina?
10348439	10348719	Alina.
10348879	10350860	Yeah, Alima's your Warcraft character.
10351280	10355361	Yeah, from the kick character from Street Fighter 3 was awesome.
10355521	10355681	Yeah.
10355941	10356121	Her.
10358021	10358761	Might get to see it.
10358801	10359141	Who knows?
10359682	10361642	DarkSakura, I know you're a Capcom fangirl too.
10361682	10364563	Any extra characters for Street Fighter 4?
10365663	10366403	That I want to see?
10366483	10366643	Yeah.
10368277	10371819	Well, in the arcade version, I would love to have Sakura if there was another arcade version.
10372859	10375320	But... Well, she'd be in there because it's all the regular characters.
10375340	10377581	But I'm saying for an arcade version, I would want Sakura.
10377822	10378022	Right.
10378442	10381143	And other than that, I'd say Ibuki.
10382724	10384285	Because I was a big Ibuki player.
10384665	10385365	Or maybe Karin.
10386826	10387206	Alrighty.
10389027	10390107	I got one more story for you guys.
10390188	10391488	Oh, I know, I know, I know.
10391508	10392008	Who would be great?
10392068	10392569	Nope, too late.
10393309	10393989	You know who would be great?
10394129	10394450	Alright, who?
10394710	10395170	Rainbow Mika.
10396219	10396419	BOMB
10419989	10422210	How much did it cost to make?
10422250	10422671	Is that profits?
10422691	10424652	So then it made less than it cost?
10448828	10450410	I believe they're saying that, yes.
10451672	10452393	But here's the thing, too.
10452693	10453274	I should say this.
10454055	10455437	Technically, it's not a video game movie.
10455457	10456358	It's a comic book movie.
10456919	10460744	But it's still got the whole video game tie-in.
10460784	10463668	But I mean, this is the really sad part, is that...
10464429	10469092	The movie Gamer with Gerard Butler made $11.8 million.
10469192	10470833	It made more money than Scott Pilgrim's first movie.
10470853	10473834	But that's a generic action movie with Gerard Butler.
10473914	10477456	I mean, this movie didn't have a lot of big names in it.
10477476	10480158	I mean, Michael Cera, yay?
10480678	10481058	I don't know.
10481819	10484160	That and people have really terrible tastes.
10484240	10488923	I mean, Vampire Sucks being number two and...
10489503	10493850	Not to say that The Expendables is a bad movie, but see, that's once again a generic action movie.
10493890	10496153	I mean, if you like action movies, you go see that.
10496173	10497095	It's going to be awesome.
10497215	10503685	Whereas, this is basically, you know, some guy that's falling in love with a woman and he has to fight her exes.
10503765	10504226	I mean, that's...
10505134	10507055	That's like, what was it?
10507075	10510175	That's almost like, was it my super ex-girlfriend or something like that?
10511036	10512996	Which was also lousy, but yeah.
10513837	10515657	I mean, that's the kind of vibe that that sends off.
10515957	10520699	I mean, granted, it was an awesome movie, but not a lot of people really get that kind of stuff.
10521219	10521999	I mean, they're not us.
10522239	10527666	Well, for what it's worth, it made more money than The Wizard, which made $4.2 million its opening weekend back in 1989.
10528286	10530829	And Alone in the Dark did better than a New Evil movie.
10530969	10532131	Oh, I hope so.
10532331	10536436	And Double Dragon with Scott Wolfe only made $2.6 million its opening weekend.
10536476	10538558	So at least it did better than that.
10538619	10541582	And Scott Wolfe is not like people reminding him about that movie.
10542943	10545824	So you really liked Scott Pilgrim, right, Loki?
10546244	10546664	I loved it.
10546684	10547305	What did you like about it?
10547345	10547925	I'd go see it again.
10548385	10549545	I just like the whole vibe of it.
10550026	10552647	There's a lot of in-jokes, I guess, if you're a gamer.
10552687	10554547	A lot of things and references that you catch.
10554867	10556108	I like the characters in it.
10556688	10559569	Like I said, one of my favorite characters was Wallace in there because he was just...
10560209	10563451	Cracking all sorts of comments and stuff throughout the movie.
10564011	10568793	But see, one of the things that bugged me about the movie is that characters like him, they just kind of disappear.
10569574	10571215	There's a lot not resolved, I feel like.
10571235	10575397	I feel like they tried to cram too much with six comic books into one movie.
10575517	10577678	But I mean, how else are you going to do it?
10577838	10579399	I don't really know how else they would have done it.
10579419	10581180	They did it with Watchmen, and Watchmen worked.
10581620	10581880	True.
10582680	10583941	What did you think of the movie, Alan?
10585979	10590042	I liked how the video game fandom meta stuff was put in.
10591223	10593865	As far as the actual story, I didn't care for it.
10593925	10595666	I thought it was kind of creepy and sexist.
10597347	10600890	Because I'm all, I don't know, I'm too serious about that kind of stuff.
10600910	10601631	Because you're a lesbian.
10601671	10604693	They glossed over some of the characters, like the twins, for example.
10604733	10606514	They kind of glossed over who they even were.
10606794	10611858	We just knew they were twins, she dated them at some point, and they had a battle, and that was it.
10612278	10613800	I mean, don't even know why...
10615280	10619441	I kind of think they should have just cut that scene out of the movie and just had her have five exes.
10619501	10620321	You know what I mean?
10621561	10623122	And so they could develop something else.
10623242	10624302	It just seemed a little strange.
10624582	10632304	But part of what I really liked about it, and I think I liked it more than Alan did, although I did have some problems with it, including an unlikable main character.
10633304	10638685	I thought that it was so random in some parts that I couldn't help but laugh my ass off.
10639085	10641266	TheVeganPolice What the hell was that?
10641326	10642706	That was funny.
10642766	10643767	Yeah, telekinesis.
10644027	10644747	It was great.
10645988	10649789	I just liked all the different random things in there.
10649889	10658232	For example, at the end where he's complaining, he's like, I can't believe you did that.
10658833	10660073	It took me two hours!
10660493	10663534	Two hours to look up all their information and contact numbers.
10665015	10665435	It was funny.
10666015	10667396	The League of Evil Exes.
10668317	10672421	See, I thought for sure that he'd become part of the League of the Evil Exes at the end of the movie.
10672522	10673803	Oh my god, spoiler!
10676146	10677387	I said I thought that he would.
10677407	10679590	I didn't say he actually did.
10679750	10682473	Alright, anyhow.
10683074	10684936	It was okay.
10684976	10685937	No, I'd say I liked it.
10686197	10686978	I think I liked...
10688547	10694189	The direction and the ambience of the movie and just the whole like, you know, just turning my brain off and enjoying it.
10694249	10695210	It's like a video game.
10695690	10697291	You know, I liked it for that reason.
10697351	10700292	I'd see it again, just especially because like DarkSakura still hasn't seen it.
10700312	10701092	She's like, I want to go.
10701112	10703653	Seriously, you need to check out the PlayStation Network game.
10704173	10705434	It is awesome.
10705834	10707635	I bet it makes a really good video game.
10707795	10709055	Ironically, awesome game.
10709195	10713037	And it's by that guy who remember when we were doing.
10713277	10717319	I've been playing with the avatar creator on the website though, that's pretty fun
10733422	10734183	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
10756841	10759565	Please call Echo 123 first.
10759625	10763369	And I think in the newer versions of Skype they actually say make a test call.
10763429	10764491	Do not skip that step.
10764551	10770358	It's very important because a lot of our crap calls come in because you didn't test your connection and then we know.
10771582	10775263	or you can always use the trusty old regular telephone and you don't have to screw around with that too much.
10775283	10781565	1-877-GAME-OLR Meanwhile, while we wait for some calls to come in, are there any last minute stories?
10781825	10786606	Yeah, Just Dance 2 just announced the track list for that.
10787346	10789927	Some songs that they have in there that you can dance to, I guess.
10789967	10791107	I'm getting hammered with calls.
10791147	10791887	We better go to the calls.
10792167	10792687	We'll come back to that.
10793268	10794228	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
10794248	10794608	Who's this?
10796648	10796928	Hello?
10797269	10798489	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
10798509	10798829	Who's this?
10800365	10801446	It's Kine.
10802106	10803087	Not too much.
10803127	10808510	I was calling in about the Poof Poof reference in Dragon Quest IX.
10808530	10813853	The reference in 3D.GameHeroes is actually from a previous Dragon Quest off of the NES.
10826541	10835818	I was titled Dragon Warriors here in the States Yeah, and I can't remember which one it was But I think it was the first Dragon Warrior that came out
10837190	10843973	I don't... I didn't even catch that as being an original Dragon Warrior reference.
10844353	10857878	I just thought it was funny, because don't they do this whole thing where they put, like, in 3D.GameHeroes, it's been a couple months since I played it, but don't they do this whole, like, little switcheroo thing where it ends up, it's her dad giving the, you know, massage or whatever they play it off as to get you ready?
10858138	10858498	Yeah.
10858518	10858738	Yeah.
10860467	10864032	And if I remember right, that's also the inside joke.
10864052	10869699	There's a lot of Dragon Quest and Zelda references inside of that game.
10869739	10875166	In the first round, you can go in the back and there's this line that says, From Dragon Quest 3.
10875887	10878029	So, that's all in.
10879289	10880469	No, I appreciate it.
10880549	10886190	In fact, it's kind of funny to know that now that that actually was from another game.
10886210	10891371	It was kind of another little reference and not just something they made up, but I like that 3D.GameHeroes, man.
10891411	10904633	If you played, especially if you actually grew up with the 8 and 16-bit games, even if you didn't, if you have an appreciation for them, but especially if you did grow up with them, I think it's just a hilarious video game because it's made by nerds like you and me, clearly.
10905874	10907054	Yeah, it was
10907884	10913131	Definitely more two-source people that grew up, you know, in this 8 and 16-bit era.
10914472	10916915	Um, oh yeah, that was the other thing.
10917015	10919579	I demand a Commodore 64 episode.
10921667	10922167	Oh my god Oh my god
10949232	10953575	Alright, well, kind, thank you so much for the call and have fun with 3D.GameHeroes.
10953635	10954395	It's a great value.
10955496	10956416	Alright, thank you.
10956536	10958878	Alright, later.
10958898	10962740	1-877-GAME-OLR if you'd like to give us a call or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
10963200	10964141	Let's go to another call.
10964221	10965322	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
10965362	10965742	Who's this?
10967243	10972386	Hey, this is Butcher, either on email or DarkKisuke on Twitter.
10972946	10975028	Butcher or DarkKisuke on Twitter.
10975068	10975528	What's on your mind?
10977040	10978421	I just want to make this quick.
10978461	10982022	I'm going to thank you guys for giving me PSP game suggestions earlier.
10982823	10983943	Oh, this was your email.
10983983	10984543	Okay, yes.
10985904	10992047	And that's about it right now, but I had something else and it completely skipped my mind.
10992634	10992974	Uh-oh.
10993834	10999575	See, this happens to us a lot when we do live radio is that we're actually doing a show and then we forget what we wanted to talk about.
10999936	11003516	But that's why we always write things down before we do the show.
11003576	11005517	But even then, it sometimes doesn't help us.
11005997	11010518	But okay, so you were asking for the PSP games?
11011798	11012418	Yeah, that was me.
11012578	11014018	Did any of those sound interesting to you?
11014058	11015699	You think you might actually go out and pick any of those up?
11016999	11021220	Yeah, once I actually get a job, I'm probably going to go out and hunt down a few Final Fantasy games.
11021741	11025203	You know, unfortunately, that is the problem a lot of people are having right now in this economy.
11025263	11029705	It's kind of ironic because we got that email about the high prices of games too.
11030386	11035628	And it's just, you know, in this economy, it's so hard to kind of afford a lot of that.
11035949	11040551	And a couple weeks ago here on the show, it was about three weeks ago now, we had that gal, and I'm so sorry, I forgot her name.
11040571	11043693	What was her, I remember her real name, but she went by something else here on the show.
11044233	11046354	The gal who sat here the night Loki had the baby.
11047274	11048255	Oh, Ashley.
11049015	11049135	No.
11049296	11050036	I forgot what her...
11051764	11053805	I forgot what her online name was, but Ashley.
11076718	11082362	Alright, well anyway, good luck with the PSP and let us know if you do find some good games to pass along to the listeners.
11082402	11083102	Let us know, alright?
11084483	11085064	Yeah, sure thing.
11085244	11086285	Alright, take care, buddy.
11086705	11088146	Oh, yeah, go ahead.
11088206	11091688	I want to talk about FU to you for getting my name wrong earlier on Twitter.
11091728	11095151	It's not DarkKisuke.
11095851	11096171	Yeah.
11097512	11098913	Anyway, that's it.
11099013	11100014	I do my best.
11100294	11101095	At least I read it.
11101235	11101535	Alright.
11102516	11103556	Take care, bye.
11104797	11105838	I try my best.
11107972	11109613	It's not spelled out phonetically.
11109653	11110673	I'm probably not going to get it.
11110713	11112413	We're getting a lot of calls tonight, but this is awesome.
11112453	11113534	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
11113554	11113934	Who's this?
11116995	11117315	Hello.
11117535	11118395	Oh, it's Xenocore.
11118475	11119616	Hey, how you doing?
11119756	11120436	A little delay there.
11120456	11120896	That's all right.
11120916	11121676	Hey, no problem, man.
11121816	11122537	It's been a long time.
11122777	11123537	I know it has.
11123617	11124577	How are you doing, Xenocore?
11125878	11133900	Well, I've moved five states, managed to secure a job after three attempts and many layoffs, and now I'm working for Dell.
11134440	11135301	Well, congratulations.
11135361	11136341	Doing army support.
11138673	11140074	Wait, you moved from where to where?
11140135	11141496	You were in, what, Virginia before?
11143137	11145419	No, I was in Sebastian, Florida.
11145719	11147281	Now I'm in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.
11147601	11151644	Oh, wow, okay, that's quite a move, going from the east to the midwest.
11151705	11154067	Wow, alright, well, how are you liking Oklahoma?
11154567	11156208	I've been there once, I was 17 years old.
11158977	11162298	It's pretty much like living on a space colony as close as you can imagine.
11162498	11168220	There's little things to do here and there of everything, but you try to go outside the perimeter and there's nothing but wasteland.
11168560	11170580	Yeah, it's kind of isolated.
11170800	11172681	That's pretty much where it's at.
11173181	11174241	Well, what's on your mind tonight?
11175962	11176862	Not much, not much.
11177202	11184004	I'm actually getting ready to restart my show, and I've been writing for the Electric Sisterhood magazine in the meantime.
11184745	11188710	I have heard they launched a magazine and it's not an e-zine, right?
11188751	11191274	It's an actual, tangible paper magazine, right?
11192796	11193817	You can get it in either form.
11193837	11195577	They got it in PDF as well as print.
11195878	11197198	Wow, that's good for them.
11197238	11199119	That can't be an easy venture for them.
11199839	11204042	And I always seem to run into Ninja Sister at trade shows, and I think she's adorable.
11204082	11204702	I really like her.
11204782	11207383	She's been on some of the OLR special shows, so she's great.
11208764	11211965	Yeah, we're pimping everything out on landofesh.com now.
11212366	11212926	Oh, very nice.
11212986	11214447	Oh, I didn't know there was a whole new website.
11214467	11215247	We'll go check that out.
11215327	11215647	Absolutely.
11215667	11216848	What kind of articles are you writing over there?
11218566	11243799	well the last one I did was a review on how the marketing departments of all these games seem to love to play with the words and tell us what game is and it's actually not that like how I got pissed off with Demon's Souls I wrote all about it in there very interesting because we were just talking earlier about and I apologize this might not have been what you wanted to call in about but we were talking a minute ago about how like it seems like a lot of marketing departments don't actually play video games at all
11245526	11245887	DarkSakura.com
11254488	11256550	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
11279226	11280046	Not much, not much.
11280367	11285729	I did see Scott Pilgrim, but actually I just recently saw it today and I was quite happy.
11285749	11287929	I started Facebooking all over the place for it.
11288390	11298834	But the one thing that surprised me that I haven't seen before was the voice of reason and the guiding light in the entire show was Scott's roommate.
11300254	11310460	and this is the best possible example I've seen of just a normal person who just happens to like guys too that's treated with a little bit more respect than I've seen in other mediums.
11310540	11312281	I think things are getting better lately.
11312701	11314923	I kind of agree with that.
11315083	11320466	It was pretty cool the way that it was just like the cool gay friend and that's just the way it was.
11320506	11321627	But I think it also shows like...
11322347	11333776	I kind of go back to the original comics, and from what I've read on the original comics is that that character was inspired by a real-life interaction that the author of the comics had with a former roommate of his.
11334196	11345705	I think it just kind of goes to show that the younger generation, especially, you know, like, and when I say that, God, I make myself sound so old, but just, you know, even folks that are like 10, 15 years younger than us, like, it's just not even an issue anymore.
11346045	11349788	And if you look at the people who do have an issue with, you know...
11350528	11352130	same-sex relations and what have you.
11352190	11354751	It's almost always old fuddy-duddies.
11357293	11364899	I don't know why they're so threatened, but it's just comforting to know that especially a lot of the folks that listen to this show, it's just whatever.
11365059	11366640	It's just not even a big deal.
11367181	11369583	I think it's great because that's the way it should be.
11369623	11371864	It's just people like who they like.
11372385	11375527	I don't even think you should have to be gay or straight.
11375827	11377629	Just be nice.
11379509	11396929	all we need and I have one gaming accomplishment I gotta share before I go I managed to find a working version of Escape from the Planet of Robot Monsters and I got to the last dude and lost all the rest of my credits there it was epic, I loved it
11399312	11399812	Thanks for watching!
11419180	11421683	Like whether on PSN or Xbox Live or whatever.
11421723	11423825	At least the newer ones from like the late 90s and such.
11426167	11426748	That's all I got.
11426868	11427589	Keep gaming alive.
11427829	11428630	Excellent job, guys.
11428750	11429891	I'll talk to you in the future.
11430231	11431673	Thank you so much for the phone call.
11431713	11432534	I appreciate it, buddy.
11432574	11433054	Have a good one.
11433575	11433975	All right, guys.
11434155	11434476	All right.
11435036	11435296	Later.
11435517	11435777	You too.
11435897	11436117	Bye-bye.
11436337	11437839	Bye.
11437879	11439521	We can take some more calls.
11439541	11442824	877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
11445289	11447771	and we'll take some more calls.
11447931	11449793	It looks like things finally slowed up here for a minute.
11450033	11451994	We can get back to the Just Dance 2 story if you want.
11452154	11452334	Sure.
11453295	11465284	Some of the songs in there, including some of the really annoying songs, they've got, let's see here, Kesha with Tick Tock, Outkast with Hey Ya.
11465364	11467946	I was just thinking there's not enough gutter trash on the Wii.
11468446	11469127	Exactly.
11470408	11472229	The Pussycat Dolls, When I Grow Up,
11475918	11477960	I don't recognize a lot of these songs.
11479521	11480821	Avril Lavigne, Girlfriend.
11481082	11484644	Let's see here.
11486405	11487666	Bonnie M, Rasputin.
11489647	11491408	Cher, the Shoop Shoop song.
11492849	11494590	Donna Summer's Hot Stuff.
11497165	11501268	This game sounds more and more like a 70s disco with each song that you read.
11501348	11503710	Ike and Tina Turner, Proud Mary.
11504010	11504410	Wow.
11504550	11506812	All right, look, we're going to go to a phone call to save this.
11506852	11509694	It does have Justice with D-A-N-C-E, and that song is awesome.
11509714	11510554	Well, that song is awesome.
11510574	11511595	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
11511615	11511975	Who's this?
11513256	11514177	Hey, it's Ranma.
11514197	11515338	How's everyone doing tonight?
11515558	11516138	I am great.
11516198	11516659	How are you?
11518180	11519140	I'm good.
11519160	11522122	Before we continue, Loki, congratulations.
11522643	11522943	Thank you.
11527563	11530306	I saw Scott Pilgrim vs. the World on Saturday.
11533268	11534749	I enjoyed the movie, but...
11535970	11552055	The only issue that I had, maybe because it's my ginormous ego and my portrayal and my odd views of the world, I just didn't like how Scott Pilgrim was portrayed as this socially inept, awkward geek.
11552515	11556096	Maybe it's because of the people that I've run with throughout the years.
11556676	11559777	I've never come across anybody as bad as him.
11561717	11562418	I can see that.
11562438	11563518	Yeah.
11565554	11569819	To me... Isn't that kind of just what Michael Cera is in every movie he's in?
11569839	11574304	Michael Cera needs to be shot.
11574604	11576886	Jesse Heinsberg should have been in that movie.
11577066	11579629	He was the kid from Zombie World.
11579909	11580870	I mean, Zombieland, I'm sorry.
11580991	11581271	Mm-hmm.
11583041	11591363	Yeah, I know, but... You know, what's funny is people think that Michael Sher was in Zombieland because they keep mistaking both guys together.
11591383	11592563	I'm like, no, that's two separate people.
11595684	11602286	But did you like him otherwise besides the whole main character, which is funny enough was one of the big problems I had with the movie.
11602786	11604146	Did you kind of like everything else about it?
11605450	11606091	Yeah, I did.
11606151	11610715	I even had to convince my best friend to watch the movie.
11610755	11613517	So maybe her view will be a little bit different if she watches it.
11616480	11626008	Yeah, it's kind of a bummer that it's doing so terribly at the box office because I feel like people will never try to do another movie like it.
11627369	11628991	Why do you think the movie's bombing so terribly?
11630382	11633905	Simply put, it went up against The Expendables and Julia Roberts.
11634125	11636607	That's the only reason why it tanked out.
11637008	11641471	Now, if it was out during an off-season, it would have done good.
11641931	11645935	Because personally, when I saw the poster, I'm like, hmm, maybe.
11645995	11646956	And I keep hearing about it.
11646976	11648717	I'm like, okay, I'll go see this.
11648977	11650919	Then The Expendables happens to show up.
11650979	11653441	I'm like, this is my 80s childhood right here.
11654121	11655623	80s childhood versus...
11656663	11684752	geekdom geek fandom versus 80s childhood yeah exactly and I'm asking people give me faith in the movie don't give me reasons to see it just give me faith in it unfortunately there was no faith for me with the Expendables it's like wow everything I don't like about 80s movies in one movie I'm like there's the perfect movie for me to not see hmm at least that's how I felt about it but you know
11688450	11693013	I picked up another DJ Hero turntable controller for $20 and I'm looking forward to DJ Hero 2.
11707409	11717463	Yeah, now's a good time to get a turntable controller if you have any interest in DJ Hero 2 because you could probably get the turntable by itself and then DJ Hero 2 by itself for much cheaper than the combo.
11718705	11723091	Maybe because I think it was only on sale with Best Buy and Kmart.
11724022	11746777	for like two weeks only and now I've been checking prices like it's back at the regular price and my turntable control was on back order for about a week and a half Tekken 6 is on sale for 10 bucks at Best Buy much better than 60 if you have the $20 coupon card which you can print out alright Ranma we're going to let you go so we can try and get at least one more call in here before we sign off for the night but thanks so much for your call okay buddy
11748069	11748589	Not a problem.
11748609	11749490	Luigi, out of here.
11749730	11750390	Alright, bye.
11750450	11750810	Take care.
11752751	11753071	Let's see.
11753792	11755573	One more call here I'm going to try to get to tonight.
11755593	11756553	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
11756573	11756933	Who's this?
11758454	11760055	This is DJ Blaziken.
11760175	11761496	DJ Blaziken.
11761536	11762216	What is on your mind?
11764297	11769339	Not much other than some possible new games for Butcher to pick up when he gets some cash.
11771220	11772661	Actually, these games went down to like $10.
11772721	11772941	Okay.
11775246	11778128	and they are Twisted Metal.
11780170	11790677	I think they even dropped... I think it's Buzz Quiz World for $7.99 on PSN.
11791337	11795360	And then... Oh yeah, Beats.
11796441	11799603	Which I also have a review for.
11800664	11802165	Which, it's kind of like...
11803243	11812151	If you were to take Beatmania and just have three lines, that's what beats is.
11812211	11820139	But the cool thing is, it's kind of like Stepmania or ITG, where you could use your own music and it goes off your memory card.
11821677	11823599	Your whole music library that you've done there.
11847817	11857766	I think is actually a lot better, and it makes its own patterns too based on the MP3s you're playing, but you're not hitting buttons at random like flailing on your keyboard in time to the music.
11858206	11859768	Audio Surf, the game's kind of different.
11859808	11862831	It's like a puzzle game mixed with music, mixed with action.
11863351	11864932	I don't know, it's different, so it works for me.
11865293	11868736	But, I mean, is this other game you're talking about button flailing or what?
11870757	11878624	Okay, actually, but this one, though, it uses all four of the external circle square buttons on your PSP.
11879545	11882067	But the cool thing is, well, here's the only jip with it.
11882627	11886250	I tried to play along with some of my DDR soundtrack songs.
11886871	11887691	It won't work with them.
11888032	11892916	It doesn't work with anything under two or three minutes.
11894077	11894838	Oh, that's weird.
11895660	11903322	I hate to say it, but for all you B-Money fans who wanted to use your B-Money soundtracks for beats, you're out of luck.
11903622	11906763	That is kind of weird that it won't work for such short songs.
11906823	11912485	I wonder if that has to do with some type of scoring algorithm or... I can't even think of achievements.
11912685	11920347	It's a scoring system, but yet it'll work with stuff like the initial B soundtrack, which I have.
11921348	11925469	The only B-Money song I have on there from that
11926423	11955525	which I think everyone knows Night of Fire of course you know a lot of the old DDR songs and I mean old old old DDR songs came from a series in Japan called Dance Mania X not to be confused with Dance Maniacs or just the Dance Mania albums and if you can go to those albums you can find a lot of longer versions of old school Bomani songs because they were all trimmed down from CD cuts that were three or four minutes long
11957560	11959681	Wow, I had no clue of that.
11960041	11961622	There you go, you learn something new every day.
11961802	11962042	Alright.
11963223	11964243	Yeah, Dance Mania.
11964683	11965404	I do have one.
11965804	11966084	Go ahead.
11966544	11984353	And so, basically, I was just wondering, what the heck else, you know, oh yeah, even though it's import only, but I say it's worth it if you love racing games, love stuff like Ridge Racer, but might be starting to get tired of it, but also loves anime.
11984373	11984613	Okay.
11987063	12013785	Initial D, Street Stage or PSP which I don't know where else to get that because nowhere sells it here in America well if it's not something you can get on the Playstation store you have to kind of go the harder routes of trying to find, fish up a copy on Ebay or Amazon or one of those but the internet really
12015976	12019257	So... Alright, well, anything else on your mind, buddy, before we let you go?
12019277	12033904	Hey, um, I got a little question for you on this actor of... Like, I saw something, it was back on the old All Games, and it said a little thing on your profile, like you had some previous college and high school broadcasting experience.
12033984	12034164	Yes.
12034864	12036165	And I got asked this, too.
12036665	12039406	Um, what got you interested in broadcasting?
12040127	12041687	That's a really good question.
12041987	12042088	Um...
12044212	12046093	That's because Rob is a big attention whore.
12046513	12047174	Not kidding.
12047194	12048414	Partially.
12048454	12049195	Seriously?
12049275	12049955	Here's the thing.
12050175	12051796	When I was in college... You know you're giving a hard time.
12051816	12052176	No, I know.
12052216	12053637	But no, part of it is I'm an attention whore.
12053677	12053937	I do.
12054077	12064482	I like the getting the... Like, for instance, last night at the Rocky thing that I was doing, I got to lead, you know, 4,000, some odd, give or take a few thousand, in doing the time warp.
12064502	12065663	And that felt awesome.
12065723	12070045	Like, just, you know, like all the people doing, you know, what I'm telling them to do is just kind of cool.
12070085	12071506	Like, you know, it was cool.
12072466	12083632	But to be honest, where that all comes from, I got into radio in college because I actually originally was studying to do computer science because I'm a nerd, I thought I'd like computers, but for me, it wasn't for me.
12083832	12084412	I didn't like it.
12084612	12085973	It's for other people, but not for me.
12086053	12089315	I actually had a really bad professor that I think kind of just turned me off to the whole thing.
12090255	12092857	But I switched to studying television.
12092897	12101203	I was actually wanting to be – for a little bit, I wanted to be a weatherman, and then I was going to be a broadcast journalist, and I actually interned for a little while at a CBS station up where I went to school.
12102183	12108748	But I found that the television industry, from my perspective, from doing all that – again, for me, obviously there's people that are into it, but for me –
12109068	12110488	Too competitive and too cutthroat.
12110909	12113049	And, you know, kind of the same thing with radio to some extent.
12113069	12116310	But when I was doing college radio, I kind of got to do things on my own terms.
12116570	12118371	And, you know, it didn't matter if no one was listening.
12118571	12122252	Even if one person was listening, it was hilarious and got to have fun doing it.
12122312	12126073	So when internet radio came about, it seemed like a real natural progression.
12126213	12137717	Although, to be fair, I think without Travis having kind of helped me make that transition, he's the host of Under Station Alive, I don't know if I would have gotten into internet radio as quickly as I did.
12138357	12164954	I think I would have gotten here eventually but I don't think I would have gotten into it as quickly as I did outside of school but if I actually wanted to go way way back and I don't think I've talked about this a lot on the show but way back in high school a friend of mine used to have a public access show we actually did on the local television station so I actually had a TV show for about two years my good friend in high school and I actually produced this show that we did it had nothing to do with video games it was more like a little comedy show that we did just because we could but
12165494	12166214	It was great.
12166234	12166854	It was great.
12184339	12187201	and my mother has them somewhere, although I don't know where they are.
12187221	12188702	And the tape's probably melted by now.
12189303	12189723	YouTube.
12190364	12191184	Nope, nope.
12191485	12200911	I will not let them out because I do not want them on YouTube because unfortunately now that I do have this show, I think if people were to see that, I just... It's... No.
12201212	12206716	And granted, it would be a pain in the ass to rip that from videotape right now.
12206836	12211319	Yeah, but unfortunately if it fell in the wrong hands, it would be done sooner than I would like it to happen.
12211479	12211799	I'm not...
12212600	12213982	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
12228678	12248350	I had a substitute teacher one day in a physics class and he came in and he was actually trying to do his little like promotional thing like you know because the public access station was kind of hurting for more volunteers and so forth and he was actually showing us a video that he did like a music video and my friend and I looked at each other and thought this is so like
12249330	12251190	Actually, that is correct.
12275205	12276946	You guys are kind of my inspiration.
12277066	12278786	I've listened to you guys since... That's amazing.
12278806	12279367	Thank God.
12279427	12279927	What was it?
12280027	12280387	Episode 50.
12280587	12288890	Back on the old Live 365 station, which I did mention in a Beatmania review for KIOS91.5.
12289030	12289370	Wow.
12289730	12290331	In Omaha.
12290511	12290911	Wow.
12291531	12295132	And I actually mentioned your guys' old Bimani Moore show.
12295712	12295873	Awesome.
12296393	12299774	Because, of course, I was reviewing Beatmania, so I figured, you know what, if you like...
12300302	12310747	you know, the stuff that you hear at the clubs during the rave period or the stuff that you might have heard way back when on Orange Lounge Radio B-Money Moore Show you'll love this game woohoo!
12311027	12329535	well thank you for the plug I appreciate it that is awesome yeah, and so but I just hope I'm on K-I-O-S dot org live stream and 91.5 K-I-O-S for Omaha listeners if there are any besides me um Jackson Studio One is the show that I'm gonna be on um
12330000	12332022	and then a few other broadcasting students.
12332923	12335505	I'm getting the first show October 7th.
12336006	12337147	Well, best of luck to you.
12337187	12338468	That is awesome.
12338869	12350020	But I laugh because when people tell me that, I think back to the video I saw in high school and I go, I hope people aren't saying I was inspired by Orange Lounge Radio because they thought this show was so terrible and ghetto.
12352372	12352933	I can see that.
12353173	12355676	But even if that's the reason, then more power to you.
12356256	12356997	I don't even care.
12357057	12357618	I think it's great.
12357678	12368730	Actually, I had somebody tell me to my face that they got into public access because they thought my old TV show, they said, it was so terrible and so awful that you guys really inspired me to do this.
12368790	12369931	And I was like, oh, thank you.
12373816	12375016	Alright, buddy, we've got to let you go.
12375597	12376237	The call's going on.
12376457	12377938	Alright, peace out.
12377958	12378579	Your show rocks.
12378899	12379219	Thank you.
12379259	12379699	You rock.
12379739	12380260	Have a good one.
12380380	12380560	Bye.
12381020	12381260	Bye.
12381741	12382301	That's awesome.
12383282	12384723	That is really the ultimate compliment.
12384763	12385203	It really is.
12385283	12386744	And I think we'll end on that note.
12386784	12388105	So thank you guys very much for the calls.
12388465	12390066	I'm so sorry to those who didn't get through.
12390106	12391287	But hey, we'll be back next week.
12391327	12393168	So please send us emails.
12393228	12396751	Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com or Twitter.com slash OLR.
12396811	12398432	We would really, really appreciate it.
12399072	12399312	Alright.
12400808	12401849	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
12418330	12421552	and the first few songs from Michael Jackson that will be in the game.
12421572	12428555	Of course, Bad, Beat It, Billie Jean, The Earth Song, The Girl Is Mine, Who Is It, and Workin' Day and Night.
12429395	12431396	Workin' Day and Night is the only one I don't recognize.
12433617	12435898	I'm sure I've heard it, I just don't recognize it by the title.
12437259	12448667	Um, yeah, so that's it, and they have some really stupid looking, you know how they do those lifestyle shots where they have, like, someone playing the game, and they show, like, you know, what it looks like on screen?
12448987	12450909	This guy looks like a douche, so.
12451950	12454551	I don't know if I want to play this game, because I don't want to be that douchey guy.
12454692	12458574	I kind of am curious, just, I'm curious just to see what it is.
12458815	12461797	I might play it once in a dark room when nobody can see me.
12462341	12481288	And then I was going to mention there's a game called MiniTroid that is, I don't know if it's out yet or it's possibly being worked on, but it's basically a remake or demake of Metroid 2, but it's a browser game and it's really cute looking.
12481368	12488390	It's kind of small, but I don't think it's been released yet, but it is coming.
12491529	12492652	IndieGames.com
12504619	12507762	I hate it when I have to find something and it's like four links in.
12508142	12510004	It's really annoying.
12510144	12510624	It's alright.
12511585	12518831	Well, speaking of annoying, I also saw that apparently they're going to be selling some Empire Strikes Back furniture for home.
12519532	12521373	Yeah, like I'm going to buy that shit.
12522414	12526157	Can we stop getting all this crap in home and start getting a use for the clubs?
12527118	12528219	Just throwing that out there.
12528739	12529440	I have to bring that out.
12529480	12531922	Every time home gets brought up, I'm going to knock the clubs.
12533973	12534353	That's it.
12534453	12535954	That's all I have to talk about.
12536694	12537094	All right.
12538755	12541656	Let's go ahead and start to wrap up the show then.
12541936	12543616	We're going to be on out of here for the night.
12543717	12548058	Really appreciate you guys joining us though after our brief little hiatus or what have you.
12548598	12550399	We're going to wrap up, get everybody's final thought.
12550459	12552040	I'm assuming you had no more last minute stories.
12552320	12554420	No, I'm just dealing with some hate in the chat room.
12555361	12556021	I'm dealing with it.
12556352	12557592	I know, because I'm trying to do a show.
12559193	12560113	Yeah, Alan?
12561174	12568716	Because I'm a big City of Heroes fan, there's a second expansion, Going Rogue, available in stores last week on Tuesday.
12569316	12570517	You can get it at Best Buy for $29.95.
12571057	12577779	It is not an upgrade, so you can buy the new game as it is, just for that price, and it comes with a free month.
12578620	12585542	And it lets you do a character that you can switch sides and become a villain or a mercenary, and there's a whole new world in there to explore.
12585982	12586402	Very cool.
12586422	12587422	I haven't checked it out yet, though.
12587442	12588683	Yeah, you gotta check that out.
12588943	12590423	You're a big City Heroes fan, I know.
12590843	12594564	Yeah, I played it from launch for about three years, took some time off, and then came back.
12594944	12596344	And then you went to go play WoW with your boyfriend.
12596364	12597264	Yeah, and I won WoW.
12597464	12597784	Sucker.
12598264	12598544	Alright.
12599925	12603285	Anyhow, I think it's about time we go around and give everybody's final thoughts.
12603745	12610486	So, well, Alan, I will start with you, and thank you very much for being here tonight, and I hope you had fun, and come back again.
12610546	12611127	I'm sure you will.
12611567	12611727	Yes.
12611907	12613327	Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
12614887	12615308	Not really.
12615829	12616410	I feel icky.
12616911	12617352	I'm sorry.
12617412	12619135	Feel better.
12619215	12621058	DarkSakura, I hate to interrupt you.
12621098	12624725	I know you're working busy over there, but do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
12625426	12625967	Don't be a hater.
12627642	12629542	Actually, I saw a license plate today that was really funny.
12629942	12633363	It was, you know how you can put symbols in the California license plate now?
12633703	12636124	They had the little hand, like, making the stop sign.
12636164	12638364	It said, stop, and then haters.
12638764	12640204	So it looked like it said, stop, haters.
12641644	12641925	It was funny.
12641945	12642265	That's great.
12642645	12650126	All right, my final thought tonight is, I don't know, I am excited to work a short work week next week.
12650206	12651266	Yay, short work weeks.
12651906	12654247	Loki, I'll give you the final thought tonight.
12654267	12655727	It's your first show back, so...
12656944	12664952	I'm tired and I'm trying to get another, or not another, but I'm trying to still get an Xbox 360 dev kit.
12665632	12669776	And I have like two people that are possibly going to sell one to me.
12670017	12672739	So I'm just waiting for them to respond back.
12674681	12675002	All right.
12675782	12678146	Well, you have a wonderful night, everybody.
12678247	12683036	Thank you so much for downloading and listening to our show, whether it be live or whether it be via podcast.
12683056	12684078	We really appreciate it.
12684719	12686783	All we ask you guys, we don't have any advertising.
12686803	12688506	Just tell two people about our show.
12688942	12693643	Help us spread the word about Orange Lounge Radio and yeah, that's really all we ask you guys.
12694224	12699345	Just help us spread the word because we can't really pay for a lot of advertising except maybe like a $10 Facebook ad here and there.
12700045	12701166	So we really appreciate it, you guys.
12701226	12704847	Leave us a nice iTunes review if you would or whatever you can do.
12705187	12705947	Help us spread the word.
12706187	12707908	We'll be back here to do it all again next week.
12707948	12709228	We really appreciate it, you guys.
12709528	12711129	Have an awesome, awesome week.
12711389	12714070	Play some games and we'll be back next week to do it all again.
12714170	12714470	Good night.
12715370	12715930	See you next week!
12747550	12748734	Thanks for watching!
