26000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	36000	Hello my friends on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio
36000	42000	We are that show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle
42000	46000	We like to think of ourselves as the place where every gamer has a voice
46000	50000	My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my awesome co-hosts
50000	53000	Say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers
53000	54000	Yo, what up?
54000	56000	How are you doing, Jamie Summers?
56000	58000	My head is a nightmare of pain
58000	61000	I'm sorry to hear that, you seem to be in a relatively good mood tonight, all things considered
61000	65000	Yeah, it's just, it's like, you wanna know, it's not really like a headache
65000	68000	It's like being, having sore muscles in my head
68000	71000	Interesting, and what else do the voices in your head tell you?
71000	74000	Tell me to punch you in the face, no I'm kidding
74000	79000	It tells me that Dan's three bean salad is amazing and you should have some
79000	85000	I may have to a little later, when I'm finished downing these yummy parmesan, garlic, and herb pita chips
85000	88000	that I managed to eat the entire bag over the course of a week
88000	90000	We should totally take a picture of you modeling them, Rob
90000	92000	Perhaps I will in a moment
92000	95000	Maybe later, then the whole chat can see my Journey shirt
95000	98000	Of course, when Dark Sakura talks about taking pictures, they usually go right to our website
98000	102000	if you don't already know about it, www.orangeloungeradio.com
102000	105000	I'm trying to think what else is on orangeloungeradio.com for them to look at
105000	110000	Occasionally a story will be posted, what? That my phone is in the bedroom and I'm too lazy to go get it
110000	113000	Well, I guess that segment of the show just got shot, didn't it?
113000	115000	No, I'll go get the camera in a minute
115000	116000	Canceled due to laziness
116000	117000	I'll go get the camera in a minute
117000	120000	Which by the way, speaking of which, did you miss us last week everybody?
120000	122000	We're back after a week off
122000	124000	Last week was cancelled due to gay
124000	127000	Yes actually, partially it was
127000	131000	Although I wouldn't say Loki's baby is a part of that
131000	135000	But yeah, I was at a Lady Gaga concert, what? And what?
135000	137000	Judge me, I don't care
137000	140000	I'm not, because I've had a change of heart
140000	142000	We can talk about that later
142000	145000	But I want to introduce, because he's back, we've missed him
145000	148000	He's been gone for a few weeks, but he is back in the house tonight
148000	150000	Say hello to Loki
150000	151000	Hello
151000	152000	Techmaster Loki, how are you doing?
152000	153000	I'm fine
153000	156000	Tell us about the baby, we all want to know
156000	161000	He's not doing much, he just pretty much sleeps and poops and eats and that's about it
161000	164000	And he's awake every now and then for a few hours
164000	167000	But we've been trying to get him to sleep a little bit better at night
167000	171000	He looks like it's kind of funny, at night he doesn't sleep too deeply
171000	175000	And looks like he makes all these arm and leg movements
175000	178000	So it looks like he's fighting somebody in his sleep
178000	180000	It's kind of funny
180000	182000	Hopefully it's not his father
182000	186000	No, he's just like, and kicking his legs up and stuff
186000	187000	Interesting
187000	189000	Has he resisted the swaddling?
189000	191000	He doesn't like to be swaddled, really
191000	193000	Neither did Becky's son
193000	196000	They always say that babies should be swaddled when they're really young
196000	199000	I've seen more babies than not, just completely hate it
199000	201000	It's so weird that everybody has babies now
201000	204000	He liked it at first, I think he gets hot
204000	207000	He takes after me, so we run really warm
207000	215000	And it's not fun to have a tight blanket on you when you're really hot
215000	220000	There was one picture of him that I have to say, he looked like a little monkey
220000	223000	He does look like a little monkey, he also looks like
223000	227000	Oh, what's his name?
227000	231000	One of the kids from Malcolm in the Middle
231000	232000	Wow
232000	235000	Dewey, he looks like Dewey from Malcolm in the Middle
235000	239000	Let's go to our chatroom at chat.orangelaungeradio.com
239000	244000	Where our chatters can chat with us live as we do tape Sunday nights at All Games Radio
244000	247000	www.allgames.com is where you can listen to our show live
247000	251000	We do tape 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at All Games Radio
251000	254000	But if you want to chat live during the show, you gotta go to a different website
254000	257000	chat.orangelaungeradio.com
257000	260000	And that's our thing, where every gamer has a voice
260000	265000	You know, yeah, we talk about news, but I'm sure most of you that go to the trouble to download gaming blogs
265000	269000	Or download gaming podcasts probably also read gaming blogs
269000	274000	So I know you get your news from there, but we talk about it with you guys and get some different perspectives
274000	277000	But tonight, it's a lot of questions about Loki
277000	279000	Toygak says, holy shit, I missed you
279000	283000	I don't know if he's talking about the show in general or Loki or both or what, but there you go
283000	287000	Spazinator says, you were gone? LOLJK
287000	290000	DJ Dark Knight says, where's our cigars?
290000	293000	I don't know, is that a tradition people still do anymore?
293000	296000	I thought after all the whole smoking kills stuff
296000	301000	You know, and they really frown on smoking in general, they don't do the cigars so much anymore
301000	304000	I've seen candy cigars, but not the real ones
304000	305000	That's dumb
305000	309000	Bobby Black Wolf, the man who does the show before us here at All Games Radio
309000	312000	Has a great question, does he appreciate the nursery?
312000	317000	He doesn't really use the nursery yet because he's still sleeping in our room in a little portable crib
317000	320000	He will eventually use the nursery
320000	323000	No, not yet, he does not appreciate the nursery yet
323000	326000	I don't think he can even see the nursery yet
326000	330000	Really only can see about 8 to 12 inches in front of him
330000	333000	Because his eyes aren't fully developed yet
333000	335000	He can see red though
335000	339000	He can see red, there's not much red in that room though
339000	342000	But yeah, so he doesn't quite appreciate it yet
342000	347000	Our friends though, their son who's like a year and three months now
347000	350000	He loves that room, he just goes in and is like ahhhh
350000	352000	And just like, goes crazy
352000	355000	So yeah, I'm sure he will appreciate it later on
355000	357000	He's just, he's a little young right now
357000	360000	Were you here the week we talked about how your pictures got on a gaming blog
360000	362000	Or was that the night Josh was born?
362000	364000	I think that was the week that Josh was born
364000	366000	Yeah, your pictures made it onto what, Game Informer?
366000	368000	Some pretty big magazine
368000	370000	And we were kind of like laughing because
370000	373000	It had nothing to do with the fact that you're here on Orange Launch Radio
373000	375000	Which you know, it's fine, nobody listens to the show
375000	378000	Except the few faithful folks we've had over the years
378000	382000	But you just cracked me up because they found your photos on Flickr
382000	384000	And thought it made for a good story
384000	386000	But I think that just goes to show like
386000	390000	Yeah sure, a lot of people may have thought of doing a Mario themed nursery for their babies
390000	394000	But Matt took the full effort with it
394000	395000	It went all out
395000	398000	I still haven't finished his mobile yet, but
398000	402000	Like I said, I'm not really in a hurry because he's not using his crib yet
402000	404000	He's not going to learn to appreciate it for a little while
404000	406000	Nah, he doesn't really care about mobiles and stuff like that right now
406000	409000	I mean, he's got his swing, has little animals dangling from it
409000	410000	He could care less
410000	412000	He'll never realize what cool parents he has
412000	414000	Doing his room in the video game theme, you know
414000	417000	Because like, by the time he's a teenager
417000	419000	Well, obviously the room will be changed by the time he's a teenager
419000	421000	By the time he's like, you know
421000	423000	It's time for that nursery theme to be changed
423000	425000	He'll probably be like, man, video games are lame
425000	429000	All my parents, or all my dad does is talk about video games
429000	433000	No, he won't do that
433000	435000	I'm just messing
435000	437000	Alright, look, he's spoiled because he'll be like
437000	441000	Oh, and they're like, oh man, I really wish I had like a Wii 2 or something
441000	443000	Be like, ah, I already got that
443000	445000	I bought that for myself
445000	447000	But hey, you can use it if you want, you know
447000	449000	He'll never get to play them because his dad will always be using it
449000	451000	He's like, hey, I want to play this game, got it for you
451000	453000	Alright, we got to introduce somebody else here in the studio
453000	455000	Because he's been so good and patient
455000	457000	Sitting there for like seven minutes
457000	459000	While we've been doing the intro to the show
459000	461000	But he's here in studio, and you've heard him before
461000	463000	He's here, it's Alan, also known as Salacious Pop
463000	465000	Is joining us in the studio tonight
465000	467000	Hello everyone
467000	469000	Oh, what a weekend I've had
469000	471000	I'm hanging in there
471000	473000	Tell us about it, because your weekend and my weekend were very similar
473000	475000	Yes, we had a road trip up to Reno
475000	477000	Because the Rocky Horror Troop that Rob is a part of
477000	479000	Was doing a Rocky Horror performance
479000	481000	For about
481000	483000	3, 500 people we think
483000	485000	The number is still debated
485000	487000	Like, I've heard everywhere from 2,000
487000	489000	To 6,800
489000	491000	And they do it in an arena
491000	493000	It's definitely the largest showing they do regularly
493000	495000	In the country
495000	497000	I think there was once a large, large, large show in LA
497000	499000	But, I mean, this is the largest regular show they do
499000	501000	Where it's literally thousands of people
501000	503000	And honestly, at that point
503000	505000	2,500, 6,800
505000	507000	Looks all the same to me
507000	509000	It's a lot of fun
509000	511000	So, I'd never been to Reno before
511000	513000	So I was really excited to
513000	515000	Go gamble a little bit
515000	517000	And I came down
517000	519000	With food poisoning
519000	521000	And was sick as a dog
521000	523000	For a day and a half
523000	525000	While we were up there
525000	527000	I know, and I was worried that you were going to get
527000	529000	That whole associated response thing with Reno
529000	531000	So the next time I said, hey, let's go to Reno
531000	533000	You'd just think about, like, barfing
533000	535000	And you'd be like, no, I don't want to go
535000	537000	I started to feel kind of
537000	539000	Fluish and crappy during the car ride up
539000	541000	And I'm like, alright, 3 hour car ride, change in elevation
541000	543000	I just feel kind of icky
543000	545000	Hit the buffet, no, my stomach was like
545000	547000	That was a bad plan
547000	549000	That was your first mistake
549000	551000	You didn't condition yourself with enough junk food
551000	553000	Beforehand, see
553000	555000	You can't go to
555000	557000	Really anywhere in Nevada
557000	559000	And not have a buffet at some point
559000	561000	Unless you live there
561000	563000	I'm sure we have plenty of listeners in Las Vegas
563000	565000	Going, ugh, I'm sick of fucking
565000	567000	Hearing about buffets
567000	569000	They suck, they're terrible
569000	571000	They can shut up because they have Krispy Kreme
571000	573000	And Krispy Kreme is awesome
573000	575000	And I wish we still had it here
575000	577000	Instead of it's going to be what
577000	579000	What were they turning into, a Chick-fil-A?
579000	581000	A Panera bread
581000	583000	A Panera, screw it
583000	585000	Put it back to being
585000	587000	A Krispy Kreme again
587000	589000	I didn't care less about Panera
589000	591000	That building's been empty for like 3 years
591000	593000	It's been a very long time
593000	595000	It's longer than 3 years
595000	597000	Finally they're putting a Panera bread in there
597000	599000	I like Panera bread, I think they're a really good
599000	601000	Healthy place to eat
601000	603000	I don't like them because they're egg sandwiches
603000	605000	They don't scramble their eggs
605000	607000	They just kind of fry it
607000	609000	And then you get chunks of
609000	611000	If it's egg salad, it shouldn't be
611000	613000	Did you say egg or egg salad?
613000	615000	No, they're breakfast sandwiches with eggs on them
615000	617000	By the way, once in a while
617000	619000	We do stop talking about food and start talking about video games
619000	621000	Just once you know it's not a Food Network podcast
621000	623000	It's a game podcast
623000	625000	If they had scrambled their eggs, it'd be
625000	627000	An even distribution between the yolk and the white
627000	629000	And the problem is, when you fry it like that
629000	631000	You get these big chunks of yolk
631000	633000	And it doesn't taste very good
633000	635000	Plus they don't season anything
635000	637000	And it's terrible
637000	639000	Really wish it was a Krispy Kreme again
639000	641000	Next time, if you really want
641000	643000	One of these nights, when I come back from the Bay Area
643000	645000	I'll have to do it when Jamie's not looking
645000	647000	Because she'll be mad
647000	649000	That's awesome
649000	651000	From the Bay Area, because they still have them there
651000	653000	You know what, I want
653000	655000	One Krispy Kreme in particular
655000	657000	Which one?
657000	659000	So you say the Cheesecake Donut
659000	661000	As much as I like them
661000	663000	My favorite to this day is
663000	665000	Still the Eclair
665000	667000	Because I do love the custard
667000	669000	I might have to think about doing that
669000	671000	Is there one on the way home for me?
671000	673000	I think there is
673000	675000	You should just take me to the Bay Area
675000	677000	Would you just take you?
677000	679000	Just take me there
679000	681000	There's one near me in Daly City
681000	683000	I don't know where you would stay for the night
683000	685000	I mean, you can't sleep in the bed with
685000	687000	What?
687000	689000	Okay, you're gonna lonely roam the streets
689000	691000	Alright, anyhow
691000	693000	I'll be driving around singing Journey songs
693000	695000	Act F in our chatroom says
695000	697000	It isn't OLR without Orange Lounge Foodie-O
697000	699000	Don't you know it
699000	701000	Monty Boggs says
701000	703000	I click off once they stop talking about food
703000	705000	They would be heaven
705000	707000	I'm sure there is a donut buffet somewhere
707000	709000	There's gotta be
709000	711000	That would be kind of dangerous
711000	713000	Now I've heard about this thing
713000	715000	I'm just perpetuating the food thing
715000	717000	I've heard about this thing now where they're making hamburgers
717000	719000	Out of Krispy Kreme donuts
719000	721000	The Luther
721000	723000	There's a name for these?
723000	725000	It's because they figured out that website
725000	727000	ThisIsWhyYoureFat.com
727000	729000	And people are like
729000	731000	That's really bad for you
731000	733000	And then we get publication
733000	735000	Because people talk about it
735000	737000	And how crazy it is
737000	739000	It's ridiculous
739000	741000	It's a trend that I wish would go away
741000	743000	There was an episode of the Boondocks
743000	745000	On Cartoon Network
745000	747000	Specifically about the grandpa opening up a soul food restaurant
747000	749000	With the Luther
749000	751000	Wow
751000	753000	It seems like one of those foods
753000	755000	You get at the State Fair
755000	757000	The State Fair is the home of
757000	759000	Terribly bad for you food
759000	761000	I'll just make a deep fried hamburger
761000	763000	I don't know
763000	765000	Take the whole hamburger
765000	767000	You've had a Monte Cristo before
767000	769000	Is that what they call it?
769000	771000	Yeah
771000	773000	I tried to get Rob to order one
773000	775000	Even when he described it
775000	777000	It was a deep fried ham and cheese sandwich
777000	779000	It's thick sourdough toast
779000	781000	With ham and Swiss
781000	783000	And then it's dipped in a sweet batter
783000	785000	Deep fried
785000	787000	And then served with strawberry jam and powdered sugar
787000	789000	It's ham and cheese
789000	791000	French toast with crap on it
791000	793000	There's a lot of things I don't like about that
793000	795000	I don't like crap on my French toast
795000	797000	Other than maybe powdered sugar
797000	799000	And I really don't like powdered sugar if I can get it without it
799000	801000	I don't really care for jams
801000	803000	And jellies and stuff like that
803000	805000	And also I hate Swiss
805000	807000	He's quite a picky eater
807000	809000	I am a picky eater
809000	811000	Swiss is one of the lowest sodium cheeses
811000	813000	Also random
813000	815000	I saw that on the menu
815000	817000	Of course there are still Bennigan's
817000	819000	What they need to do is they need to take a burger
819000	821000	Bread it in the pub
821000	823000	Is that what it's called?
823000	825000	I don't know what Bennigan's is
825000	827000	I've seen it
827000	829000	I've never been there
829000	831000	Didn't we go at California Extreme?
831000	833000	No we went to IHOP
833000	835000	No we went to Bennigan's and then IHOP
835000	837000	You guys went to Bennigan's during the day
837000	839000	Dan and I showed up later
839000	841000	We went to Bennigan's
841000	843000	I'm sorry I'm distracted
843000	845000	I'm trying to get into how is your gaming week
845000	847000	But I have to ask Darsakra
847000	849000	She likes to surf the web during this show
849000	851000	She's on Facebook right now looking at pictures of Carol Channing
851000	853000	What?
853000	855000	The company that I work at
855000	857000	That I'm about to get laid off of
857000	859000	I found my boss's Facebook page
859000	861000	My first boss who hired me
861000	863000	And I'm looking at his photos of him
863000	865000	He was Carol Channing?
865000	867000	You were hired by Carol Channing?
867000	869000	Do you like raspberries?
869000	871000	Hired!
871000	873000	But he's the world's biggest Ann-Margret fan
873000	875000	And he's also
875000	877000	He's gone to her house
877000	879000	Got tons of photos
879000	881000	He and his partner
881000	883000	Have met
883000	885000	Her and her husband
885000	887000	And gone to shows
887000	889000	And sat in box seats
889000	891000	But I'm also looking at his other photos
891000	893000	Of other celebrities that he's met
893000	895000	And there's like him and Carol Channing
895000	897000	And Bo Derek and that's pretty cool
897000	899000	He's gonna be really sad in about 10 years
899000	901000	Wish I had pictures
901000	903000	With all the celebrities I've met
903000	905000	I have a picture
905000	907000	With um
907000	909000	My rock star hero
909000	911000	Mr. Castlevania himself
911000	913000	Good times
913000	915000	Yeah, with his wild hair
915000	917000	And him being taller than me
917000	919000	And looking absolutely like he was gonna pee himself
919000	921000	When I asked him in Japanese if I could have a photo
921000	923000	You were there for that
923000	925000	I was, I think I took the photo
925000	927000	Yes you did
927000	929000	And since Dark Sakura brought up Castlevania
929000	931000	I'll use it as a segue to finally talk about games
931000	933000	So Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?
933000	935000	Or two weeks if you wish
935000	937000	I really didn't play much of anything
937000	939000	I played a little pinball
939000	941000	And mostly I watched Dan scream
941000	943000	At his Nintendo emulator
943000	945000	Well today I watched him yell
945000	947000	At Rad Racer
947000	949000	But I wanted to hear the music
949000	951000	And the doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
951000	953000	The one that was used in the
953000	955000	The Strong Bad
955000	957000	Anime one
957000	959000	Anyway
959000	961000	Then Dan played some Turbo Out Run
961000	963000	And Out Runners
963000	965000	It was old school racing to hear it
965000	967000	Fuck it and turn it off
967000	969000	And
969000	971000	I found my Ninja Pass
971000	973000	But I couldn't find my SD
973000	975000	My micro SD card
975000	977000	I think those are pretty cheap to come by
977000	979000	Yeah, I ordered one for five bucks
979000	981000	But the whole reason I wanted it
981000	983000	Is because since I'm going back to the gym
983000	985000	My favorite thing to do is to go
985000	987000	Well, back in the day it was go on the elliptical
987000	989000	And play Pokemans
989000	991000	So now it's gonna be
991000	993000	I guess play whatever
993000	995000	Game I happen to have on me
995000	997000	And I wanted to find some of those
997000	999000	SNES ROM conversions
999000	1001000	For the DSI
1001000	1003000	Nice
1003000	1005000	And then I can play lots and lots of Seiken 3
1005000	1007000	Because that's been the game
1007000	1009000	I've really been wanting to get into
1009000	1011000	Or just Final Fantasy 6, 3, whatever you want
1011000	1013000	I have a new game that I'm going to be playing
1013000	1015000	Thank you to a lack of forgetfulness
1015000	1017000	Finally, after like a month
1017000	1019000	I finally remember to bring Dark Sakura
1019000	1021000	Final Fantasy 13
1021000	1023000	Yeah, I really should finish that game
1023000	1025000	I'll be playing the crap out of this
1025000	1027000	And I start school next week too
1027000	1029000	Good times, you're gonna be busy
1029000	1031000	And Tuesday is old school DDR night
1031000	1033000	At Arviggle
1033000	1035000	Yes, I'm gonna go
1035000	1037000	I don't know if I'll actually play Ditter
1037000	1039000	But I'll definitely play some 2DX
1039000	1041000	And if they ever
1041000	1043000	Fix their frickin' Technica machine
1043000	1045000	I'll play that too
1045000	1047000	Alright
1047000	1049000	Maybe I'll play like
1049000	1051000	One round of DDR
1051000	1053000	That would be fun, I haven't done that forever
1053000	1055000	But I'm almost afraid to try again
1055000	1057000	Just because last time
1057000	1059000	That's cause I still think
1059000	1061000	It's humbling, you're gonna have to
1061000	1063000	Go down to 5 footers to like get yourself
1063000	1065000	Back into it
1065000	1067000	I've been playing 6's and 7's and it's been
1067000	1069000	Fun for me
1069000	1071000	It's humbling, cause you'll be all like
1071000	1073000	What was that one song, it's like a 9 footer
1073000	1075000	It's really fast, the heavenly something
1075000	1077000	Angelic mix
1077000	1079000	Oh, Healing Vision Angelic mix, that's it right?
1079000	1081000	It's one of those really fast
1081000	1083000	Songs that you dance to in DDR
1083000	1085000	And it's like super fast 9 footer
1085000	1087000	Back when I was in my younger
1087000	1089000	20's when DDR first came out
1089000	1091000	Or I guess when Max first came out
1091000	1093000	I was able to pass that song after a little bit of practice
1093000	1095000	But it didn't almost give me
1095000	1097000	Like a heart attack like it did when I tried it
1097000	1099000	I couldn't even finish it
1099000	1101000	It's insane. Well you remember back in the day
1101000	1103000	I could play tons of stuff
1103000	1105000	And now, but this is
1105000	1107000	How I look at it is
1107000	1109000	I've got those shiny
1109000	1111000	Sort of old
1111000	1113000	Dance pads I picked up at the thrift store
1113000	1115000	I'm gonna start playing again
1115000	1117000	I've had no
1117000	1119000	There's no excuse for me to have
1119000	1121000	Just not done it
1121000	1123000	I am really curious about this DDR
1123000	1125000	I need to bring this up at some point
1125000	1127000	Because I don't think it's in the show or otherwise
1127000	1129000	They had the Dance Dance Revolution preview
1129000	1131000	Party this past week
1131000	1133000	None of us went, but my buddy Mel
1133000	1135000	Who you guys all know Mel B
1135000	1137000	If you've been listening to the show long enough
1137000	1139000	He's been on before, he went
1139000	1141000	The pictures looked fun
1141000	1143000	Think DJ Tyrant who does sometimes an article
1143000	1145000	Or here or there for our website, he went too
1145000	1147000	And they said, well dance
1147000	1149000	Masters was clearly
1149000	1151000	The game to play there
1151000	1153000	That was a lot of fun
1153000	1155000	But the DDR for the PS3
1155000	1157000	Eh, the move stuff is kind of gimmicky
1157000	1159000	But otherwise, it's a pretty decent
1159000	1161000	DDR game and the song list looks
1161000	1163000	Really cool, like it's got a lot of really good songs
1163000	1165000	In it I gotta say
1165000	1167000	I liked the machine they had there
1167000	1169000	Yeah, there's a new X2 is now coming out
1169000	1171000	He said that was a sweet song list
1171000	1173000	And they fixed the dance pads, they're not so crappy anymore
1173000	1175000	Because X had really bad dance pads
1175000	1177000	They got DDRX at Dave and Buster's in town
1177000	1179000	I had to laugh
1179000	1181000	Sorry to interrupt
1181000	1183000	Because you mentioned Mel B
1183000	1185000	I had to laugh because I've been seeing this on my release list
1185000	1187000	And I finally found the box art for it
1187000	1189000	They have a game coming out in the week called
1189000	1191000	Get Fit with Mel B
1191000	1193000	Apparently there's a woman named Mel B
1193000	1195000	It's Scary Spice
1195000	1197000	That's who that is
1197000	1199000	That's Scary Spice, Mel B
1199000	1201000	Sorry
1201000	1203000	Go power blah blah blah
1203000	1205000	I'm Mel B
1205000	1207000	I'm the runner up on Dancing with the Stars
1207000	1209000	On the internet, doesn't know who I am
1209000	1211000	At any rate
1211000	1213000	Dan and I are having our fifth wedding anniversary
1213000	1215000	Oh
1215000	1217000	And we were gonna
1217000	1219000	Get folks together on the day before
1219000	1221000	Because we can't do the $40
1221000	1223000	Free play thing all day thing
1223000	1225000	On our actual anniversary
1225000	1227000	So we were gonna go and
1227000	1229000	Hit up Dave and Buster's and have like a big party
1229000	1231000	With whoever wants to show up
1231000	1233000	What day is this?
1233000	1235000	31st
1235000	1237000	It'll be August 31st
1237000	1239000	I should be here
1239000	1241000	And the first is our actual fifth year anniversary
1241000	1243000	And the second is when my conversion goes through
1243000	1245000	Oh wow
1245000	1247000	When do you do the whole um
1247000	1249000	The dip on the second
1249000	1251000	Oh wow
1251000	1253000	Fun dip
1253000	1255000	Good times
1255000	1257000	And then I will be shiny and new
1257000	1259000	And then you are officially
1259000	1261000	Yes
1261000	1263000	One of the chosen people at that point right?
1263000	1265000	One of the chosen people
1265000	1267000	Congrats in advance
1267000	1269000	Well somehow we completely deviated
1269000	1271000	From the talk of video games
1271000	1273000	What did we hit on in there?
1273000	1275000	Jews, Spice Girls
1275000	1277000	No but anyway
1277000	1279000	Loki
1279000	1281000	I haven't been playing a whole lot
1281000	1283000	You got a good excuse
1283000	1285000	I'm trying to think back to what I played at the hospital
1285000	1287000	On the DS
1287000	1289000	I don't even know if I played anything on the DS
1289000	1291000	I played a little bit more of
1291000	1293000	Spirit Tracks
1293000	1295000	That game is okay
1295000	1297000	I just
1297000	1299000	Some of the Zelda games on the DS
1299000	1301000	I just don't go through them very quickly
1301000	1303000	But it's alright
1303000	1305000	Then mainly
1305000	1307000	The only thing I've been playing since I got back to work
1307000	1309000	Has been
1309000	1311000	The Grand Theft Auto Lost and Damned
1311000	1313000	Yes we've gone back to Lost and Damned now
1313000	1315000	Because they were kind of craving
1315000	1317000	The open world Grand Theft Auto
1317000	1319000	Deathmatch things
1319000	1321000	And since you can't really do that
1321000	1323000	In the Battle of the Gay Tony
1323000	1325000	We're playing Lost and Damned
1325000	1327000	It's actually a little bit more fun
1327000	1329000	It's a little less serious
1329000	1331000	Because I'm not really trying to get up on the leaderboards
1331000	1333000	For that
1333000	1335000	I kind of want to go back to the Battle of the Gay Tony
1335000	1337000	So I can actually get to the top of the leaderboards
1337000	1339000	Because I kind of stopped at rank 59
1341000	1343000	But then on top of all that
1343000	1345000	I've been working still on
1345000	1347000	Working on my mods and stuff
1347000	1349000	For Grand Theft Auto
1349000	1351000	Because I have a really big one in the works
1351000	1353000	Right now that's going to be
1353000	1355000	Completely
1355000	1357000	Stuff that's never been done before
1357000	1359000	On the console version
1361000	1363000	And thankfully I
1363000	1365000	Upgraded my computer to Windows
1365000	1367000	7 64 bit
1367000	1369000	And added another 4 gigs of RAM
1369000	1371000	So now it runs smoothly
1371000	1373000	And I can actually run Grand Theft Auto
1373000	1375000	After having it crash after 5 minutes
1375000	1377000	There was something weird with the installation
1377000	1379000	Or something on XP
1379000	1381000	So now it's really stable
1381000	1383000	Which is great and I can actually work on it
1383000	1385000	Lots of baby jokes in the chatroom
1385000	1387000	Spaznator wants to know if you've been playing Babymaker Extreme
1387000	1389000	No
1389000	1393000	Frisbee says Loki has been playing lots of Imagine Babies
1393000	1395000	No
1395000	1397000	It's just
1397000	1399000	Just been playing reality babies
1399000	1401000	Just been playing washing the bottles
1401000	1403000	Changing the diapers
1403000	1405000	Good times
1405000	1407000	Fun stuff like that
1407000	1409000	Because now
1409000	1411000	With the sleep schedule and everything
1411000	1413000	We have to get up a lot of times
1413000	1415000	I kind of have to stick to the old person schedule
1415000	1417000	Where I have to go to bed at 9 o'clock
1417000	1419000	At night
1419000	1421000	Well it's been 11
1421000	1423000	11 o'clock at night is really what we've been sticking to
1423000	1425000	But sometimes 9 o'clock at night
1425000	1427000	Or 10
1427000	1429000	Between 9 and 11
1429000	1431000	Because I have to get up in the morning like at 5 in the morning
1431000	1433000	You know with the babies
1433000	1435000	So
1435000	1437000	That's how long it takes me to wake up
1437000	1439000	Is about 2 hours with the baby and stuff
1439000	1441000	And also on the weekends
1441000	1443000	I wake up early with the baby
1443000	1445000	To try to take him out of the room
1445000	1447000	So if he's fussing
1447000	1449000	Nelly can sleep some
1449000	1451000	With all that and having to change him
1451000	1453000	And do stuff every 3 hours
1453000	1455000	It really doesn't give me a lot of time to work on anything
1455000	1457000	So
1457000	1459000	Gameplay and stuff
1459000	1461000	I have a lot of stuff to play
1461000	1463000	Including a lot of things I really shouldn't be playing
1463000	1465000	I don't think anyone is surprised
1465000	1467000	That you haven't been able to play
1467000	1469000	A whole lot lately
1469000	1471000	We'll get into things I shouldn't be playing right
1471000	1473000	A little bit later
1473000	1475000	And then
1475000	1477000	Yeah just lots of stuff to
1477000	1479000	To be doing
1479000	1481000	But I've been mainly just working on the Grand Theft Auto stuff
1481000	1483000	Because that's what I play at work
1483000	1485000	And it's going to be so fun
1485000	1487000	When I mod things done
1487000	1489000	DarkSakura
1489000	1491000	You missed something you want to talk about in your week?
1491000	1493000	I played Star Trek Online
1493000	1495000	Of course you always do. Anything exciting going on there?
1495000	1497000	Dabo! The implemented Dabo
1497000	1499000	So you can gamble for Latinum
1499000	1501000	And they have Hololita
1501000	1503000	And they got Chase Masterson to do her voice
1503000	1505000	Wow
1505000	1507000	Lots of stuff in that game keeps growing over there
1507000	1509000	Good times
1509000	1511000	Alan! How you doing? How was your gaming week?
1511000	1513000	Pretty uneventful
1513000	1515000	I played the
1515000	1517000	Castlevania Harmony of
1517000	1519000	Schadenfreude or whatever the 360 version is
1519000	1521000	No I'm joking about the name
1521000	1523000	The multiplayer one
1523000	1525000	I played the demo of that, didn't like it
1525000	1527000	Don't know why
1527000	1529000	Playing as Alucard, upscaled HD graphics
1529000	1531000	Castlevania
1531000	1533000	Gave it two rounds
1533000	1535000	It's weird
1535000	1537000	It doesn't feel like other Castlevania games
1537000	1539000	I hear that the game really shines on its best
1539000	1541000	When it's multiplayer
1541000	1543000	No big surprise, most games are better
1543000	1545000	When it's multiplayer
1545000	1547000	Playing it normal is really strange
1547000	1549000	Especially the way the whole map
1549000	1551000	Is zoomed out in the beginning
1551000	1553000	Is just kind of a weird
1553000	1555000	Weird feeling
1555000	1557000	Some puzzle quests too, still working on that
1557000	1559000	Can only play that
1559000	1561000	For maybe 30-45 minutes
1561000	1563000	At a time because
1563000	1565000	When you get to the lower levels
1565000	1567000	I'm almost at the max level
1567000	1569000	I'm level 43 out of 50
1569000	1571000	I get to play so much freaking Bejeweled
1571000	1573000	Just to clear a room, it kind of becomes a grind
1573000	1575000	And of course World of Warcraft
1575000	1577000	Got some accomplishments
1577000	1579000	Done in that
1579000	1581000	What are your biggest accomplishments in World of Warcraft so far?
1581000	1583000	50 mounts
1583000	1589000	And I finally grinded all five cities in Argent Tournament
1589000	1593000	So I got my super hella exalted Argent champion
1593000	1595000	With cheesecake achievement
1595000	1597000	Does Blizzard actually mail you a cheesecake?
1597000	1599000	I hope so
1599000	1601000	Because all those dailies, never again
1601000	1603000	I wanted to die
1603000	1605000	Man, I would so play an MMO
1605000	1607000	If they sent you things in real life
1607000	1609000	For doing all the grinding
1609000	1611000	I mean you're paying $14.95 a month
1611000	1613000	Just to send a little cheap
1613000	1615000	Can you imagine if you're suddenly in the mail one day
1615000	1617000	Congratulations on your uber mount, here's a cheesecake
1617000	1619000	I want to play S.T.O. and have them send me
1619000	1621000	Romulan ale or a warp core breach
1621000	1623000	That would be a great idea
1623000	1625000	Davo, you win liquor
1625000	1627000	But you know there'd be people that would exploit the hell out of that
1627000	1629000	So they'd have to think of funny ways to put caps on it
1629000	1631000	But it's kind of like one of those loyalty programs
1631000	1633000	Like what, Square Enix sends out what
1633000	1635000	Like iPhones or no, iPod Touches or whatever
1635000	1637000	If you're like an uber platinum
1637000	1639000	Bought every game we ever put out member or whatever
1639000	1641000	But yeah
1641000	1643000	Anyhow
1643000	1647000	And our guild is now 6-12 of ICC
1647000	1649000	Same guild I'm in of course
1649000	1651000	We got down Rotface and
1651000	1653000	Festergut
1653000	1655000	And we're working on Valtheria
1655000	1657000	Dreamwalker, Healy, Dragon
1657000	1659000	Which probably was not the best idea for the next boss
1659000	1661000	Which I don't like that fight at all
1661000	1663000	So I don't know, we're going back in tomorrow
1663000	1665000	So maybe we'll do the Blood Princes
1665000	1667000	Is that what it is? The Blood Queen, the Princes
1667000	1669000	Princes and then Queen is after them
1669000	1671000	Yeah we gotta do that whole thing
1671000	1673000	Wow wow wow
1673000	1675000	I've been playing a lot of WoW 2 of course
1675000	1677000	All the same things he's been talking about
1677000	1679000	Well actually no cause my accomplishments I don't have nearly the same stuff
1679000	1681000	I haven't done the uber stuff
1681000	1683000	Alan's really good at focusing on one character
1683000	1685000	And I've got, I've started to develop
1685000	1687000	You know as the weight continues on
1687000	1689000	For Cataclysm, Ultihallism
1689000	1691000	And you know I've been leveling
1691000	1693000	A shaman which has been fun
1693000	1695000	And been slowly
1695000	1697000	Working on my warrior
1697000	1699000	Who was lulled at like 76 for the past
1699000	1701000	Like 4 months, she's up to like 78 now
1701000	1703000	So I'll probably get her over the hill
1703000	1705000	To 80 at some point then I'll have another 80
1705000	1707000	Outside of that though
1707000	1709000	Another Blizzard game I've been playing a lot of
1709000	1711000	I finally played
1711000	1713000	Starcraft 2
1713000	1715000	Which is old news
1715000	1717000	To a lot of you guys you know
1717000	1719000	Those of you that are huge fans of Starcraft
1719000	1721000	Bought this game the day it came out I'm sure
1721000	1723000	But you might remember I was very apprehensive
1723000	1725000	About getting into Starcraft because
1725000	1727000	The RTS thing I find to be very
1727000	1729000	Overwhelming especially when I see screenshots
1729000	1731000	For the game I'm like there's so much shit on the screen
1731000	1733000	How are you supposed to be able to manage all that
1733000	1735000	I don't understand this is too complicated
1735000	1737000	My feeble brain can't handle this
1737000	1739000	Of course I mentioned a couple weeks on the show
1739000	1741000	I came to the realization that my ex-boyfriend
1741000	1743000	Used to play Starcraft and he really
1743000	1745000	Enjoyed it and was a big fan of it and I'm thinking
1745000	1747000	If that asshole can play then so can I
1747000	1749000	So I finally said you know what
1749000	1751000	I'm going to just suck it up and get Starcraft 2
1751000	1753000	Because I have a lot of friends that play I'll figure it out
1753000	1755000	And I've been having a good time with it
1755000	1757000	It's actually
1757000	1759000	Quite a bit of fun and it's not nearly as bad
1759000	1761000	As I thought it would be for learning
1761000	1763000	At least in the campaign
1763000	1765000	The campaign very clever
1765000	1767000	In the way it does it it works into the story
1767000	1769000	Where like the first mission you don't even
1769000	1771000	Build structures you're just kind of walking around
1771000	1773000	And learning how to engage in combat
1773000	1775000	And walk around second mission
1775000	1777000	Okay now you're building structures and they
1777000	1779000	Add little bits and pieces at a time
1779000	1781000	Into this so the campaign is really cool
1781000	1783000	The way it's developed
1783000	1785000	Multiplayer
1785000	1787000	Not so noob friendly
1787000	1789000	I mean they've done some things
1789000	1791000	There's this whole practice league you can do
1791000	1793000	For a little while you can slow down the game
1793000	1795000	A lot I mean there are some things they've done
1795000	1797000	To help it be a little bit easier but
1797000	1799000	You know at the end of the day when you try to play
1799000	1801000	A human opponent it's it's it's tough
1801000	1803000	And
1803000	1805000	Playing though against like the computer AI
1805000	1807000	Depending on how you do it is
1807000	1809000	Is cool like you know
1809000	1811000	A friend of mine from the WoW guild and I were playing
1811000	1813000	Online the other night and we were playing
1813000	1815000	Two versus two but we would slow down
1815000	1817000	The game and we played very
1817000	1819000	Easy computer and it was almost too easy
1819000	1821000	Like we whooped it like three times so we
1821000	1823000	Said let's step it up to easy
1823000	1825000	And still we were able to conquer it
1825000	1827000	You know a little more difficult but not not too bad
1827000	1829000	So but then we played
1829000	1831000	Like instead of a custom game
1831000	1833000	We actually played the regular co-op
1833000	1835000	Mode that was like I don't know
1835000	1837000	Some different mode where you couldn't change
1837000	1839000	The speed so the speed was
1839000	1841000	Fast and we got annihilated
1841000	1843000	We got zerg literally
1843000	1845000	By because both computer opponents
1845000	1847000	Happened to be zerg and we just got slaughtered
1847000	1849000	And it was really hard so
1849000	1851000	As long as I can play the game slow
1851000	1853000	I'm good and then or getting better
1853000	1855000	I should say and I know the
1855000	1857000	Speed thing will come with time but
1857000	1859000	Yeah so multiplayer has been a very interesting
1859000	1861000	Experience but campaign is really cool
1861000	1863000	You know very animated very cool
1863000	1865000	Little like decks that you go through on the ship
1865000	1867000	To kind of well you're not
1867000	1869000	You don't start there you actually start in a
1869000	1871000	Different area but you move on to the ship
1871000	1873000	And you can kind of buy enhancements
1873000	1875000	And things which are really cool
1875000	1877000	So I like what they did there
1877000	1879000	Where things get weird I think with starcraft
1879000	1881000	Is that they made this
1881000	1883000	Decision to put out three starcraft
1883000	1885000	Games and they're gonna do I think the zerg game
1885000	1887000	Is coming next and there's gonna be a protoss game
1887000	1889000	Later on there what all
1889000	1891000	Within the next year year and a half maybe
1891000	1893000	I don't remember how far apart these games are supposed to be
1893000	1895000	But they're all coming out and my question is
1895000	1897000	You know for 60 bucks
1897000	1899000	For this game I feel like I got
1899000	1901000	A pretty good deal there's a really
1901000	1903000	Well fleshed out multiplayer game
1903000	1905000	There's a solid single player game in there
1905000	1907000	I'm a happy camper
1907000	1909000	But my question is in the next game
1909000	1911000	Okay there's gonna be
1911000	1913000	A zerg campaign alright I get that
1913000	1915000	That'll be cool cause I'll actually get to learn how to play
1915000	1917000	Zerg cause that's the other
1917000	1919000	Problem I have with multiplayer right now is that
1919000	1921000	Being that I am new to starcraft I didn't really
1921000	1923000	Get into the first game
1923000	1925000	I don't know what I'm doing when I play
1925000	1927000	Zerg or protoss I mean yeah I know
1927000	1929000	They have a lot of the similar stuff but I don't
1929000	1931000	I don't know it and there's no real easy
1931000	1933000	Way to learn it so
1933000	1935000	I guess these other games might be an easy way
1935000	1937000	For me to learn it but for everybody else
1937000	1939000	That's super into starcraft
1939000	1941000	I don't know how they're gonna justify 60 dollars
1941000	1943000	Just for a zerg campaign
1943000	1945000	Doesn't seem like
1945000	1947000	There's gonna be enough there I mean
1947000	1949000	I'm imagining they'll just have to do a shit ton
1949000	1951000	Of maps and some other enhancements
1951000	1953000	To multiplayer here and there
1953000	1955000	Achievements I don't know but 60 dollars
1955000	1957000	Is really gonna feel
1957000	1959000	Like you're not getting the same
1959000	1961000	Value out of the second game
1961000	1963000	So you do the first game and maybe
1963000	1965000	Obviously it's probably a little early for me
1965000	1967000	To be saying something like that cause I haven't played
1967000	1969000	The second game but I just kinda look at it
1969000	1971000	And go what are they gonna add that's gonna
1971000	1973000	Make it worth all that money cause multiplayer
1973000	1975000	Is multi you know that's I don't see that changing
1975000	1977000	A whole lot
1977000	1979000	I wanna
1979000	1981000	I think I recall the blizzard developers saying
1981000	1983000	Last year that when they announced that they were
1983000	1985000	Doing three separate releases
1985000	1987000	That the campaigns the story modes for each
1987000	1989000	Game is gonna be anywhere from
1989000	1991000	25 to 40 hours whatever is
1991000	1993000	Considered a full game length
1993000	1995000	Cause in Starcraft 1
1995000	1997000	All three campaigns together made up the game
1997000	1999000	So you're gonna be playing as the Terrans for
1999000	2001000	30 hours to get their whole story
2001000	2003000	Zerg for 30 hours to get their whole campaign
2003000	2005000	So I guess they're really it's more like a trilogy
2005000	2007000	I guess in one
2007000	2009000	Sequel but it's still gonna be really hard
2009000	2011000	After having plopped the money and
2011000	2013000	Feeling that value from this first
2013000	2015000	Game when I get that second game
2015000	2017000	If I don't feel that same value
2017000	2019000	I'm not gonna be pleased
2019000	2021000	If you don't care about lore really
2021000	2023000	And you're just in it for the multiplayer and the maps
2023000	2025000	Which a lot of people are
2025000	2027000	30 hours of campaign even if it's like ooh let's
2027000	2029000	You know go into the heart of the politics of the Zerg
2029000	2031000	It's like yeah I don't care
2031000	2033000	That's 30 hours I could be working on my ranking in league mode
2033000	2035000	Right? Yeah
2035000	2037000	So it's gonna be very interesting to see how they justify it
2037000	2039000	I think it's gonna be tough
2039000	2041000	But you know I don't know Blizzard
2041000	2043000	Clearly they know what they're doing
2043000	2045000	They have much success on the PC
2045000	2047000	You know I'm really excited for Diablo 3
2047000	2049000	And obviously the new WoW expansion
2049000	2051000	But at this point
2051000	2053000	I kind of look at it and go
2053000	2055000	I don't know if this was the best decision
2055000	2057000	I mean from a money making perspective
2057000	2059000	It was but
2059000	2061000	They might do 60 bucks, 45 bucks, 45 bucks
2061000	2063000	They might take it down a notch
2063000	2065000	On the prize for the latter two
2065000	2067000	I wonder if they're gonna do the other two as expansions
2067000	2069000	To the first one so you have to buy the first game
2069000	2071000	Ho ho
2071000	2073000	Wow
2073000	2075000	I could see that
2075000	2077000	If the second and third games were just expansions
2077000	2079000	To the first game
2079000	2081000	That I get but that's not the way Blizzard's talking
2081000	2083000	So I don't know
2083000	2085000	Alright anyhow
2085000	2087000	We're gonna get into some gaming news here
2087000	2089000	Now that we're done with our gaming week
2089000	2091000	But first some housekeeping
2091000	2093000	Not a whole lot of housekeeping I want to share tonight actually
2093000	2095000	Please join our Facebook if you haven't already

2103000	2105000	And of course you can always email us
2105000	2107000	At mailbag at Orange Launch Radio
2107000	2109000	Dot com we'll get to reading your emails
2109000	2111000	A little later in the show
2111000	2113000	Otherwise not a lot of show
2113000	2115000	I mean we had last week off I don't see us having another show
2115000	2117000	Off until
2117000	2119000	Probably I know Halloween
2119000	2121000	Is on a Sunday this year right so there probably
2121000	2123000	Is not gonna be an alarm
2123000	2125000	I sent you a message about that
2125000	2127000	You did but I think it was when I was really intoxicated in Reno
2127000	2129000	That's something to discuss later
2129000	2131000	Yes how I
2131000	2133000	Drank so much in Reno that I actually fell out of the bed
2133000	2135000	Oh no I meant Halloween but
2135000	2137000	Oh uh
2137000	2139000	I just made that up
2139000	2141000	It's really funny huh
2141000	2143000	Rob fell out of the bed
2143000	2145000	Alright yeah we'll talk Halloween later
2145000	2147000	But otherwise we're set for a little while
2147000	2149000	Alright uh or
2149000	2151000	I don't know about Labor Day weekend
2151000	2153000	Because that's gonna be tough cause it's a three day weekend
2153000	2155000	We'll see
2155000	2157000	Drunk show?
2157000	2159000	It's gonna be an idea actually
2159000	2161000	We haven't done that in a long long time
2161000	2163000	No we haven't
2163000	2165000	I doubt Loki would be participating in that
2165000	2167000	Yeah I don't think I could
2167000	2169000	Does Dan drink at all? Can Dan drink?
2169000	2171000	He's not big on it
2171000	2173000	You know what we should do
2173000	2175000	We should do the marathon episode of Orange Lounge Radio
2175000	2177000	Yes
2177000	2179000	Cause there's nothing on
2179000	2181000	On All Games Radio after us
2181000	2183000	And we should just honestly see
2183000	2185000	And I don't know how the listeners will feel about this
2185000	2187000	We should do the regular show
2187000	2189000	And then we just go for it
2189000	2191000	Go as long as we possibly can
2191000	2193000	I wonder if there's a Guinness Book of World Records
2193000	2195000	For the world's longest podcast
2195000	2197000	We wouldn't hit it
2197000	2199000	Because I know some of these people
2199000	2201000	Especially when they do the charity bus
2201000	2203000	The desert bus
2203000	2205000	That thing goes on for like a week
2205000	2207000	But I'm talking about podcast
2207000	2209000	Even then I don't think we'd hit it in just 24 hours
2209000	2211000	We'd have to take it two weeks time
2211000	2213000	We'll add gaming podcast
2213000	2215000	In front of that
2215000	2217000	The longest episode of the official gaming podcast
2217000	2219000	Of the universe
2219000	2221000	I'm looking at the chatroom
2221000	2223000	Chat.orangeloungeradio.com
2223000	2225000	Breakman in our chatroom
2225000	2227000	Just for the record says falling out of the bed
2227000	2229000	Is way better than falling off the toilet
2229000	2231000	Haven't done that
2231000	2233000	Let's see
2233000	2235000	The chatroom says ooh drunk show
2235000	2237000	And of course as always we would drink responsibly
2237000	2239000	If we do have a drunk show then somebody else
2239000	2241000	Is gonna have to drive me here
2241000	2243000	On the vault floor like Jamie's other
2243000	2245000	Houseguests do
2245000	2247000	We'll figure that out
2247000	2249000	Tigerclaw says it'll be like an after birth XXL
2249000	2251000	Yeah something like that
2251000	2253000	Sj100matt says we should invite
2253000	2255000	Irene and Xtopher for this
2255000	2257000	We definitely should try to get other people here
2257000	2259000	If we do that
2259000	2261000	Maybe I'm onto something
2261000	2263000	I'm not going out of town for Labor Day
2263000	2265000	I usually do but I'm not this year
2265000	2267000	That's actually in two weeks
2267000	2269000	I plan on sitting on my ass
2269000	2271000	Are you available to come up here?
2271000	2273000	I was gonna say if you're staying at home
2273000	2275000	For Labor Day weekend I'm coming up here then
2275000	2277000	Maybe we'll do that
2277000	2279000	If people feel like crashing
2279000	2281000	So we can sleep in cycles
2281000	2283000	We've got the futile mattresses
2283000	2285000	In the vault
2285000	2287000	I can make it into a comfortable little bed
2287000	2289000	We have comfortable couches
2289000	2291000	We'll figure something out
2291000	2293000	That's in two weeks though
2293000	2295000	I just realized oh crap that's in two weeks
2295000	2297000	So next week we'll have an answer
2297000	2299000	On what's gonna happen in two weeks
2299000	2301000	Alright in the meantime
2301000	2303000	How about some actual bonafide gaming news
2303000	2305000	Loki I know you've missed the gaming news
2305000	2307000	How are you doing?
2307000	2309000	Doing alright
2309000	2311000	So there's a rumor going around saying that the brand new
2311000	2313000	Or I guess the next iteration
2313000	2315000	Of the PSP will have touch sensitive
2315000	2317000	Controls on the back of the system
2317000	2319000	Now this isn't that far fetched
2319000	2321000	Of an idea because if you've
2321000	2323000	Seen any of the
2323000	2325000	Shots of the PSP
2325000	2327000	On the phone that's supposed to be coming out
2327000	2329000	It actually has some sort of touch panels
2329000	2331000	On the front of the unit
2331000	2333000	I don't understand the back how that's really gonna
2333000	2335000	Work it seems a little awkward to me
2335000	2337000	But I guess we'll see
2337000	2339000	Um
2339000	2341000	And apparently this is coming from
2341000	2343000	An unnamed source according
2343000	2345000	To Eurogamer and
2345000	2347000	Um
2347000	2349000	There's not really
2349000	2351000	Much to go on I guess other than
2351000	2353000	Saying that um
2353000	2355000	Apparently the device is gonna
2355000	2357000	Be roughly the size of the PSP 3000
2357000	2359000	And um
2359000	2361000	That looks like there's gonna be plenty
2361000	2363000	Of room left over for
2363000	2365000	A physical media slot
2365000	2367000	On it so
2367000	2369000	None of this PSP go crap
2369000	2371000	Cause honestly that didn't sell very well at all
2371000	2373000	I think they were super flimsy
2373000	2375000	Yeah
2375000	2377000	Guess what Sony apparently people do like to buy
2377000	2379000	Physical copies of their games
2379000	2381000	Who would have thought
2381000	2383000	Um
2383000	2385000	So
2385000	2387000	I don't know it'd be interesting to see
2387000	2389000	If this really does anything
2389000	2391000	I think they really should just stick with
2391000	2393000	Putting at least a second analog stick on there
2393000	2395000	Um cause the actual PSP
2395000	2397000	Phone thing um had
2397000	2399000	This touch panel that would kind of replace
2399000	2401000	The analog sticks
2401000	2403000	And you could kind of use it like the analog sticks
2403000	2405000	Cause it was almost like a strip
2405000	2407000	Um which is an interesting idea I guess
2407000	2409000	But
2409000	2411000	I don't know
2411000	2413000	Hopefully the system will do a lot better than the
2413000	2415000	Last PSP so
2415000	2417000	I don't think the last PSP oh well the PSP Go
2417000	2419000	Did terribly yes but the original
2419000	2421000	You're not talking about the original PSP
2421000	2423000	I'm talking about the original PSP it's not done well recently
2423000	2425000	Well compared to the DS but it's done
2425000	2427000	Better than a lot of systems do
2427000	2429000	I would think
2429000	2431000	What other systems are we talking about out there?
2431000	2433000	The Lynx, the Game Gear, the
2433000	2435000	Gamescom, the uh
2435000	2437000	What was that shitty little thing they showed off at E3
2437000	2439000	A few years ago it was a portable device
2439000	2441000	The Gizmodo? The Gizmodo
2441000	2443000	The N-Gage, it's been better than all of those
2443000	2445000	I like the little
2445000	2447000	Guitar game on the Gizmodo though
2447000	2449000	Barely though Gizmondo that was it
2449000	2451000	Gizmondo
2451000	2453000	Oh Gizmodo's a gaming block
2453000	2455000	Or something like that
2455000	2457000	It's a dumb name for device anyways
2457000	2459000	Gizmondo
2459000	2461000	But yeah it's just I don't know
2461000	2463000	I don't see them doing too much
2463000	2465000	Stuff that's very different than the last
2465000	2467000	PSP I think that
2467000	2469000	The system's okay
2469000	2471000	They just have to make a few enhancements to it
2471000	2473000	And hopefully they'll learn from their mistakes
2473000	2475000	Um
2475000	2477000	And I hope for their sake that it's a little more
2477000	2479000	Secure as far as cracking it goes
2479000	2481000	No
2481000	2483000	Wait what adds value
2483000	2485000	To these rumors? Cause rumors
2485000	2487000	Can you know kinda come from anywhere
2487000	2489000	Like I could say oh the next PSP is gonna double as a
2489000	2491000	Cigarette lighter woohoo you know there you go
2491000	2493000	But uh
2493000	2495000	Cut, print, run with it
2495000	2497000	PSP to have cigarette lighter
2497000	2499000	But what adds this any value
2499000	2501000	What they're saying here
2501000	2503000	Um
2503000	2505000	Honestly don't know
2505000	2507000	So I guess we don't really know
2507000	2509000	I mean for all we know this could be
2509000	2511000	Some sort of
2511000	2513000	Analyst talking about the system
2513000	2515000	I don't know
2515000	2517000	Let's see here
2517000	2519000	It's um
2519000	2521000	According to three separate development sources
2521000	2523000	That have seen the new PSP
2523000	2525000	And
2525000	2527000	They're saying that it's gonna
2527000	2529000	Have a touch sensitive area on the back of the
2529000	2531000	Unit behind the screen
2531000	2533000	Which is weird if you think
2533000	2535000	About it I mean
2535000	2537000	That's just awkward
2537000	2539000	I mean if I'm gonna control a game and I'm
2539000	2541000	Touch screens on the back
2541000	2543000	Unless it like flips
2543000	2545000	Over or something so you can do like
2545000	2547000	Touch screen type games like the DS or something
2547000	2549000	But
2549000	2551000	I don't know
2551000	2553000	Going to our chatroom at chat.orangelandraday.com
2553000	2555000	Odd1 says I hope they keep the online
2555000	2557000	Functionality of the device, podcasting
2557000	2559000	Decent web browsing, shit was
2559000	2561000	Kind of cash you know and SD cards
2561000	2563000	Yeah um I kind of agree
2563000	2565000	PSP's biggest strength wasn't necessarily
2565000	2567000	The games that were on it but the fact it was kind of an all
2567000	2569000	In one type of thing I mean minus the phone
2569000	2571000	But you don't need a phone there
2571000	2573000	They added their advantage definitely
2573000	2575000	There but and the games were
2575000	2577000	Not bad I mean the games were good
2577000	2579000	It's just for whatever reason
2579000	2581000	Well I know what the reason is
2581000	2583000	You know they have rampant piracy
2583000	2585000	And I'm sure that's affected their
2585000	2587000	Sales of different games
2587000	2589000	And because of that now you don't have a lot of games being
2589000	2591000	Developed for the PSP just because it's not
2591000	2593000	Doing as well
2593000	2595000	I don't think it was a
2595000	2597000	Terrible system at all but
2597000	2599000	There's a few things that they could have fixed
2599000	2601000	Like you know the second analog stick would have been
2601000	2603000	Nice
2603000	2605000	Definitely think it should have at least two analog sticks
2605000	2607000	And then as far as the controls
2607000	2609000	Go I think it's fine maybe add
2609000	2611000	Some you know an L2 R2
2611000	2613000	Button you know so it's more like
2613000	2615000	The Playstation
2615000	2617000	And that's about it that's all you really need
2617000	2619000	To do as far as controls go because the controls
2619000	2621000	You know scheme
2621000	2623000	Is pretty much the same thing that's on the
2623000	2625000	Playstation 3 and the Xbox 360
2625000	2627000	And it works well you don't need to
2627000	2629000	Add some touch screens to it
2629000	2631000	Hell if you want to make the screen a touch screen or something
2631000	2633000	That's fine you know so you can type and stuff
2633000	2635000	It's a lot easier than you know the
2635000	2637000	Phone dialing type thing that they had
2637000	2639000	Going with it
2639000	2641000	That would be fine if you just
2641000	2643000	Make the screen a touch screen for that kind of stuff
2643000	2645000	Because people dig that
2645000	2647000	And if you want the control scheme you know for
2647000	2649000	Different like casual games
2649000	2651000	That would be fine
2651000	2653000	But I don't think they really need to reinvent
2653000	2655000	You know the controls for the system
2655000	2657000	Itself it's pretty good
2657000	2659000	Alright
2659000	2661000	Well we'll see what happens I would imagine if there
2661000	2663000	Was going to be a new PSP probably not going to hear anything
2663000	2665000	About it until next year's E3
2665000	2667000	They're saying it's expected to launch
2667000	2669000	At the end of 2011
2669000	2671000	Makes sense because you have the 3DS coming out
2671000	2673000	At the beginning of 2011 so
2673000	2675000	We'll see what happens maybe it'll do 3D
2675000	2677000	On top of all that doubt it
2677000	2679000	We'll see
2679000	2681000	By the way before I get into my next story I did want to bring
2681000	2683000	This up because somebody in chat had actually talked about
2683000	2685000	Let's see it was a little while ago here
2685000	2687000	But talking about the gaming marathon
2687000	2689000	Or the marathon we were talking about doing over Labor Day weekend
2689000	2691000	Tiger Con or chat room says
2691000	2693000	Seems like a good idea for those of us in the west coast
2693000	2695000	Or for those in the west coast
2695000	2697000	But for the east coast it would be enormously late for us
2697000	2699000	I actually got
2699000	2701000	A message right after that from
2701000	2703000	Bobby Blackwolf who does the show
2703000	2705000	Before us telling us he's actually going to be out
2705000	2707000	Labor Day weekend so that means
2707000	2709000	There's going to be no programming on all games radio
2709000	2711000	At all on Sunday because Dragon Con
2711000	2713000	Is that same weekend and PAX
2713000	2715000	So we'd only be going up against PAX
2715000	2717000	And Dragon Con
2717000	2719000	Just that?
2719000	2721000	I think there's a lot of people
2721000	2723000	Listening to our show though that aren't able to afford
2723000	2725000	To fly out to Seattle or Atlanta
2725000	2727000	So I'm sure there'll be an audience
2727000	2729000	For it if we want to do it
2729000	2731000	So we'll see
2731000	2733000	We'll have to see what happens
2733000	2735000	I have to make sure it's okay that we can
2735000	2737000	Just hijack the stream for a whole day
2737000	2739000	But I don't see why not
2739000	2741000	I think more people would rather hear the talking
2741000	2743000	Than the music but maybe it's just me
2743000	2745000	Anyway we'll let you know next week
2745000	2747000	As we move on talking about some more gaming news
2747000	2749000	And GoldenEye is happening on
2749000	2751000	Of course the Wii coming out a little later
2751000	2753000	This year
2753000	2755000	Except it's GoldenEye with Daniel Craig
2755000	2757000	Which is a little weird but you know it is
2757000	2759000	Somewhat of the same game
2759000	2761000	That you should know of before
2761000	2763000	Well what's pretty cool is that when the game comes out
2763000	2765000	They're going to be releasing a bundle that actually
2765000	2767000	Comes with a classic controller
2767000	2769000	So if you want to spend
2769000	2771000	$70 or $69.99
2771000	2773000	To be exact
2773000	2775000	Oh that's right because they have the
2775000	2777000	What's the difference? The classic controller
2777000	2779000	It's got the little grippies on it
2779000	2781000	There's a little bit extra stuff
2781000	2783000	But also not just the fact that it's pro
2783000	2785000	But it's gold, get it?
2785000	2787000	GoldenEye, gold
2787000	2789000	Golden Wii, Wii is golden
2789000	2791000	Golden Wii
2791000	2793000	So if you want to get a golden controller
2793000	2795000	Well there isn't actually a golden Wii
2795000	2797000	Just a golden classic controller pro
2797000	2799000	For your white Wii or your black Wii
2799000	2801000	Does it tell you to drink more water?
2801000	2803000	Sorry
2803000	2805000	Don't lick it
2805000	2807000	Don't lick the golden Wii
2807000	2809000	No release date
2809000	2811000	Announced outside the United States
2811000	2813000	So if you're in another country you may not be getting this
2813000	2815000	At all but you know what
2815000	2817000	Usually it's the other countries that get all those
2817000	2819000	Games, or not the games
2819000	2821000	The different colors and things for their systems
2821000	2823000	Before we do so
2823000	2825000	You can wait on this one
2825000	2827000	I don't know it sounds cool I already have a classic controller
2827000	2829000	Might not be pro with grippy things
2829000	2831000	I don't think I need a second one
2831000	2833000	Heck my Wii still isn't even hooked up
2833000	2835000	Although, shit
2835000	2837000	Metroid's out
2837000	2839000	Today?
2839000	2841000	It's next week
2841000	2843000	It's not next week, it's the week after next
2843000	2845000	Or wait, no it is next week
2845000	2847000	It has to be next week
2847000	2849000	The intro to that
2849000	2851000	The little trailer that was up
2851000	2853000	Is gorgeous
2853000	2855000	It looks awesome
2855000	2857000	I'm going to have to dust off the Wii and hook it up again
2857000	2859000	I think I really want to play that game
2859000	2861000	So we'll see
2861000	2863000	It's the first Wii game I've been interested in a very long time
2863000	2865000	But I did play Goldeneye a little bit at E3
2865000	2867000	And you know, it's Goldeneye
2867000	2869000	But I think it's just cashing on
2869000	2871000	The nostalgia
2871000	2873000	I don't think there's going to be
2873000	2875000	A whole lot else this brings to the table
2875000	2877000	Hey remember Goldeneye?
2877000	2879000	Hope that Oddjob isn't so much of a cheap bitch
2879000	2881000	I actually played as Oddjob
2881000	2883000	And he was an awesomely cheap bitch
2883000	2885000	Awesome
2885000	2887000	Dan and I watched this video
2887000	2889000	That's like the top ten dick moves
2889000	2891000	To pull in a game
2891000	2893000	And one of them is playing Oddjob
2893000	2895000	In deathmatch and Goldeneye
2895000	2897000	Okay now, I don't remember why
2897000	2899000	Why is he a cheap bitch?
2899000	2901000	Because he's short
2901000	2903000	It's like when he's right up on you
2903000	2905000	You can't shoot him
2905000	2907000	You have to aim low to shoot
2907000	2909000	But the hat toss thing is the best thing ever
2909000	2911000	It really is
2911000	2913000	There's a shoe, honestly
2913000	2915000	When we were in Reno at the hotel
2915000	2917000	I noticed
2917000	2919000	That the direct to your room streaming
2919000	2921000	For video games is N64 games
2921000	2923000	Which is just so backwards
2923000	2925000	And weird to me, I don't know why
2925000	2927000	It's been that way for years
2927000	2929000	And now what kind of technology
2929000	2931000	Is that run on? Is that similar to like the
2931000	2933000	Streaming
2933000	2935000	The PC games on live
2935000	2937000	Is that like on live in a hotel?
2937000	2939000	How does that work?
2939000	2941000	It's much lower tech than that
2941000	2943000	It's literally, I think, running a cartridge
2943000	2945000	Wow
2945000	2947000	So like too many people can't play it at once?
2947000	2949000	Since I'm on eBay right now
2949000	2951000	They do sell those systems sometimes
2951000	2953000	I don't remember what they're called
2953000	2955000	But they're really expensive and they have
2955000	2957000	A bunch of different
2957000	2959000	N64 games in there
2959000	2961000	That they can stream
2963000	2965000	Just while
2965000	2967000	Logie's looking at that, in our chatroom
2967000	2969000	At chat.orangelandraday.com, some of the chatters
2969000	2971000	Are talking about Netflix on the Wii
2971000	2973000	And a lot of folks using the Wii for Netflix
2973000	2975000	I'm talking about the LodgeNet Nintendo 64
2975000	2977000	Yes, wow
2977000	2979000	That the Wii
2979000	2981000	Is a good bedroom gaming console
2981000	2983000	And that a lot of people can get Netflix
2983000	2985000	In their bedroom with that
2985000	2987000	You do need a disc for that
2987000	2989000	There's no Netflix channel at this time
2989000	2991000	But some folks are kind of talking about that
2991000	2993000	Looking at a comment from Odd1 in chat asking
2993000	2995000	Does Goldeneye have online play?
2995000	2997000	I believe it does
2997000	2999000	But no voice chat
2999000	3001000	You just have to double opt in with your
3001000	3003000	45 digit friend code
3003000	3005000	Kind of what you're used to in the games
3005000	3007000	No voice chat, despite the fact we made this
3007000	3009000	Successory that we don't really use at all
3009000	3011000	Go Nintendo
3011000	3013000	Awesome
3013000	3015000	Alright, so
3015000	3017000	Going on Dark Sakura, what do you got for us?
3017000	3019000	Well you know what's better than a Nintendo 64
3019000	3021000	Lots of things actually
3021000	3023000	Peanut butter's better than a Nintendo 64
3023000	3025000	Hey
3025000	3027000	Mario Kart 64 was
3027000	3029000	Fucking awesome
3029000	3031000	Peanut butter is awesome
3031000	3033000	Dreamcast is pretty awesome
3033000	3035000	Guess what? They're still making games
3035000	3037000	I had these coconut M&M's today that were delicious
3037000	3039000	I had mocha M&M's
3039000	3041000	They were actually better than a Dreamcast
3041000	3043000	I have mocha M&M's and they're pretty damn good
3043000	3045000	I mean you can't lick a Dreamcast
3045000	3047000	Well you could, but it wouldn't be very tasty
3047000	3049000	Avoid the warranty on that
3049000	3051000	Unless you're Jessica Chopra
3051000	3053000	Anyway
3053000	3055000	They put out The Last Hope
3055000	3057000	And Wind and Water Puzzle Battles
3057000	3059000	And Rush Rush Rally Racing
3059000	3061000	They're doing more
3061000	3063000	Dreamcast games, they want to do more
3063000	3065000	And more, and they're actually trying to see if companies
3065000	3067000	Will release their games
3067000	3069000	On the Dreamcast
3069000	3071000	So they've got
3071000	3073000	Another release planned for next year
3073000	3075000	But to supplement
3075000	3077000	You know, any losses
3077000	3079000	They've actually, you know, well
3079000	3081000	To supplement their costs
3081000	3083000	They'll be reproducing games for WiiWare
3083000	3085000	And Xbox Live Arcade too
3085000	3087000	I was going to say, they should talk to Sega since they're going to be doing
3087000	3089000	Those Dreamcast games on
3089000	3091000	Live already
3091000	3093000	Yeah, when?
3093000	3095000	Soon
3095000	3097000	They did have Crazy Tax 83
3097000	3099000	And the guy behind it, he totally wants
3099000	3101000	Sega to start producing for the
3101000	3103000	Dreamcast again
3103000	3105000	Which I kind of think isn't going to happen
3105000	3107000	What could possibly make you think that?
3107000	3109000	Maybe because
3109000	3111000	They've said themselves the Dreamcast is over
3111000	3113000	Yeah
3113000	3115000	Also, yeah, who's going to produce new Dreamcast
3115000	3117000	Hardware? How long is it before the
3117000	3119000	Patents are up on those things and then all the
3119000	3121000	Korean and Chinese knockoff
3121000	3123000	Systems can come out, like the Nintendos
3123000	3125000	The Patents are up
3125000	3127000	On the old school Nintendos and you see all these
3127000	3129000	New Nintendos coming out
3129000	3131000	That are, you know, they don't have the
3131000	3133000	Blow on the cartridge problem
3133000	3135000	Or any of that stuff, I mean it's all kind of different now
3135000	3137000	I want the Famicom Disk System
3137000	3139000	Personally
3139000	3141000	I think there's one out there that plays NES and Genesis games
3141000	3143000	I want to say I saw
3143000	3145000	I have something that will do that
3145000	3147000	I have an NES and I have a Genesis
3147000	3149000	They have a Genesis one
3149000	3151000	And I have a PC
3151000	3153000	The portable Genesis one
3153000	3155000	I have a portable Genesis, it's called a Nomad
3155000	3157000	I want to say it's about 20 years, because I have a feeling
3157000	3159000	The Super Nintendo one is going to lapse really soon
3159000	3161000	It already has, they have Super Nintendo
3161000	3163000	systems out there
3163000	3165000	Do they really?
3165000	3167000	You know, new
3167000	3169000	Duo LT's and I'll be happy
3169000	3171000	But it would be interesting, I mean
3171000	3173000	Not to deviate too much from the topic at hand
3173000	3175000	But you know, even if Sega didn't want to do the Dreamcast
3175000	3177000	Themselves, license
3177000	3179000	Before the patent lapses
3179000	3181000	If they're just going to sit on it
3181000	3183000	Let someone else develop a Dreamcast
3183000	3185000	I honestly think the Dreamcast games are still pretty solid
3185000	3187000	You're cut out, for some reason
3187000	3189000	I think the Dreamcast games are still pretty solid
3189000	3191000	I mean, I've gone back
3191000	3193000	And wanted to play stuff up
3193000	3195000	I've been doing that today, I want to play Sonic Adventure
3195000	3197000	Because, well, you know
3197000	3199000	I'm still kind of hot
3199000	3201000	I'm holding the thing in
3201000	3203000	I'm telling you, we're not hearing you
3203000	3205000	Well, I'm still wanting to play
3205000	3207000	Sonic Colors, when it comes out
3207000	3209000	So I've been like, let's play Sonic Adventure
3209000	3211000	So
3211000	3213000	Alright
3213000	3215000	Well, we'll see how
3215000	3217000	Successful this venture is
3217000	3219000	It was also really easy to pirate Dreamcast games
3219000	3221000	So we'll have to see how successful this venture is
3221000	3223000	And hey, even if you couldn't
3223000	3225000	Get the game to burn right, you'd always get a great soundtrack
3225000	3227000	True
3227000	3229000	And they're those games that that company's putting out
3229000	3231000	They are out there
3231000	3233000	For piracy reasons
3233000	3235000	Why am I not surprised?
3235000	3237000	I just run them on my cabinet at home
3237000	3239000	Because I have a Dreamcast emulator on there
3239000	3241000	So, you know, fresh rush rally
3241000	3243000	Or whatever is pretty awesome, and I don't know where to buy that game
3243000	3245000	Not that I would anyway
3245000	3247000	Since it's like 40 bucks
3247000	3249000	40 bucks for a Dreamcast game, nowadays
3249000	3251000	No
3251000	3253000	Anyhow
3253000	3255000	So it's kind of funny
3255000	3257000	Apparently, Microsoft got this great idea
3257000	3259000	Excellent idea, that they're going to
3259000	3261000	Digitally distribute
3261000	3263000	Review copies of
3263000	3265000	Halo Reach to the press
3265000	3267000	Or press people
3267000	3269000	Or whomever they have that they're distributing this to
3269000	3271000	And it's available
3271000	3273000	In a games on demand format
3273000	3275000	Through live
3275000	3277000	In fact, some people found it actually
3277000	3279000	On the
3279000	3281000	Marketplace for
3281000	3283000	99,999
3283000	3285000	Microsoft points
3285000	3287000	Which is just, you know, it's just
3287000	3289000	That's not showing up on the console, right?
3289000	3291000	That's some website trick
3291000	3293000	Actually showing up on the website
3293000	3295000	And, you know, obviously
3295000	3297000	Even if you did have the
3297000	3299000	$1250
3299000	3301000	To purchase the game, it would let you
3301000	3303000	Purchase the game
3303000	3305000	Unfortunately though
3305000	3307000	Even though it did
3307000	3309000	Come up on there
3309000	3311000	Someone found a way to download it
3311000	3313000	And then people found a way
3313000	3315000	To crack it
3315000	3317000	And now it's leaked out there
3317000	3319000	Thanks to Microsoft
3319000	3321000	Which is ironic because this is probably
3321000	3323000	Why they did this in the first place
3323000	3325000	They probably switched to digital distribution
3325000	3327000	To avoid the piracy of the discs
3327000	3329000	And what happened was this
3329000	3331000	Game site, I think
3331000	3333000	GameTutorial.com
3333000	3335000	They
3335000	3337000	Originally downloaded it
3337000	3339000	And then they're like, haha, we have it
3339000	3341000	We're not going to share it with anybody
3341000	3343000	And somehow their copy leaked out to
3343000	3345000	Somebody else that was less scrupulous
3345000	3347000	Than they were and sent it out to the
3347000	3349000	Community and everybody figured out how to crack it
3349000	3351000	Like immediately
3351000	3353000	That website got it legitimately?
3353000	3355000	No, they found a way to hack the
3355000	3357000	Live server
3357000	3359000	To download it without actually having to have the code
3359000	3361000	And stuff
3361000	3363000	They did that
3363000	3365000	And
3365000	3367000	Yeah, so it's not
3367000	3369000	Too good for Microsoft
3369000	3371000	And of course they're investigating
3371000	3373000	How people were able to
3373000	3375000	Get this
3375000	3377000	Once it's on the internet, it's out there
3377000	3379000	That's a really bad one to lose
3379000	3381000	I'm surprised that
3381000	3383000	They didn't test this
3383000	3385000	On not so much of a triple A title
3385000	3387000	They tested it on
3387000	3389000	They did it with Crackdown 2 apparently
3389000	3391000	It's on there like that
3391000	3393000	But it didn't matter with Crackdown 2
3393000	3395000	Because that got leaked out a week or two before
3395000	3397000	It was actually released
3397000	3399000	This has been leaked out
3399000	3401000	Three weeks before
3401000	3403000	It comes out
3403000	3405000	The format that they've broken down to now
3405000	3407000	Games on Demand packages
3407000	3409000	Are basically how you install
3409000	3411000	A game onto your hard drive
3411000	3413000	It's that format
3413000	3415000	Or if you download it from their service
3415000	3417000	It's the same format but you're just downloading it
3417000	3419000	Consoles out there that are
3419000	3421000	Hacked with JTAG
3421000	3423000	Basically they can run
3423000	3425000	Pretty much anything
3425000	3427000	There's a program out there to convert
3427000	3429000	The games on demand packages to ISO
3429000	3431000	Or like a disk format
3431000	3433000	And then you just dump all the files on there
3433000	3435000	So that's what they basically did
3435000	3437000	After they cracked
3437000	3439000	The file that was on there
3439000	3441000	Monty Boggs in our chat
3441000	3443000	says
3443000	3445000	Bungie will ban hammer
3445000	3447000	That's actually kind of an interesting point
3447000	3449000	Because this is all being done digitally
3449000	3451000	And these copies are signed
3451000	3453000	Isn't there a way that Microsoft could
3453000	3455000	Ban hammer all the consoles that have this?
3455000	3457000	Well, yes and no
3457000	3459000	Because yes they could ban them
3459000	3461000	If they were dumb enough to take them online
3461000	3463000	But these are being
3463000	3465000	These copies that are out there right now
3465000	3467000	Are used on JTAG systems
3467000	3469000	Which are not used for online play
3469000	3471000	JTAG systems would get banned anyways
3471000	3473000	If you connected to Live after about four hours or so
3473000	3475000	You would get your console banned
3475000	3477000	So these systems are just meant for playing
3477000	3479000	See what they're doing now
3479000	3481000	Is to play online
3481000	3483000	Is they're using tunneling services
3483000	3485000	To use system like over the internet
3485000	3487000	To play other people
3487000	3489000	So that's how they're getting around it
3489000	3491000	So they don't care that they can't connect to Live
3491000	3493000	Oh they use like a warp pipe style thing
3493000	3495000	Yes exactly
3495000	3497000	So they're using tunneling services
3497000	3499000	To basically play online
3499000	3501000	And stuff like that
3501000	3503000	And also they're not really missing out on anything
3503000	3505000	If there's download content
3505000	3507000	Is this why we see less and less games supporting System Link?
3507000	3511000	My mind goes to Starcraft 2 and the LAN thing
3511000	3513000	Well the LAN thing
3513000	3515000	That's something different
3515000	3517000	I think the reason why consoles don't use System Link nowadays
3517000	3519000	Is because the games are so sophisticated
3519000	3521000	That they have trouble running them as a server
3521000	3523000	And also running the game
3523000	3525000	At the same time
3525000	3527000	It's not easy for them to do it
3527000	3529000	They have to program it
3529000	3531000	Efficiently enough to where they can do that
3531000	3533000	Like I wish Grant had thought it was System Link
3533000	3535000	Because
3535000	3537000	We would still be playing our mod game
3537000	3539000	Because we wouldn't have to update anything
3539000	3541000	So we could have been doing that
3541000	3543000	But we had to play over Live
3543000	3545000	Red Dead Redemption was System Link
3545000	3547000	And that's awesome because our internet connection at work sucks
3547000	3549000	And so a lot of times we get disconnected from Live
3549000	3551000	So System Link is definitely the way to go
3551000	3553000	And also we used to play Saints Row 2
3553000	3555000	Which was a good backup game
3555000	3557000	If our Live ever went down
3557000	3559000	We would just play a System Link game of that
3559000	3561000	And of course
3561000	3563000	Call of Duty and Halo
3563000	3565000	Is always supported System Link
3565000	3567000	Because of the LAN play and stuff like that
3567000	3569000	So they're not going to just take it out
3569000	3571000	Because of piracy
3571000	3573000	But yeah it kind of sucks
3573000	3575000	They tried to bypass it
3575000	3577000	But unfortunately there's no way around it
3577000	3579000	But the minute you try to take a
3579000	3581000	Hacked version of the game
3581000	3583000	Or a pirated version of the game online
3583000	3585000	You're going to get banned
3585000	3587000	If they play it on your
3587000	3589000	Say you have an account that you would use
3589000	3591000	On a JTAG system and on a Live system
3591000	3593000	If it shows that you're playing the game
3593000	3595000	Before the release like that
3595000	3597000	They're going to probably ban you anyways
3597000	3599000	Or at least flag you and watch what you do
3599000	3601000	So obviously if you're going to play the game
3601000	3603000	You don't play it on your account that you use on Live
3603000	3605000	But
3605000	3607000	I don't know
3607000	3609000	Alright
3609000	3611000	But yeah it's tragic
3611000	3613000	But that sort of thing happens
3613000	3615000	What's also funny though
3615000	3617000	Actually kind of tying in with the hacking stuff
3617000	3619000	There was a USB
3619000	3621000	Mod chip
3621000	3623000	Announced actually for the Playstation 3
3623000	3625000	That's going to be released next week
3625000	3627000	And apparently
3627000	3629000	This chip kind of works like
3629000	3631000	I guess
3631000	3633000	A tool that they have for
3633000	3635000	Actual Playstation repair
3635000	3637000	And stuff like that it puts the system into a developers mode
3637000	3639000	Where you can run on signed code
3639000	3641000	And apparently
3641000	3643000	This chip or whatever
3643000	3645000	The USB card
3645000	3647000	Can be updated
3647000	3649000	You can update the firmware on it
3649000	3651000	So they can never really be locked out from the system
3651000	3653000	And also it's going to be able
3653000	3655000	You're going to be able to dump games to your hard drive
3655000	3657000	And run them straight off your hard drive
3657000	3659000	Like you could with the Playstation 2 HD loader
3659000	3661000	And stuff like that
3661000	3663000	That's something that will be interesting
3663000	3665000	It's called the PS Jailbreak
3665000	3667000	Even though I don't really think it's a jailbreak
3667000	3669000	But that will be coming out
3669000	3671000	Next week which will be interesting
3671000	3673000	Now what about I saw this story on some websites
3673000	3675000	And the story said
3675000	3677000	Well we don't know what's going on
3677000	3679000	Because they're just showing this running on a debug system
3679000	3681000	Which is
3681000	3683000	They're showing a feature that isn't new for a debug system
3683000	3685000	Well that was that one video
3685000	3687000	That was from
3687000	3689000	I don't remember if it was osmodchips.com
3689000	3691000	Or something like that
3691000	3693000	It's one of the stores that's selling them
3693000	3695000	Online they were showing it running on their debug system
3695000	3697000	But the thing is
3697000	3699000	The company or whomever that made these chips
3699000	3701000	Send it out to a bunch of different sites
3701000	3703000	To review and test out
3703000	3705000	And stuff like that
3705000	3707000	And there were other people that do not have
3707000	3709000	Debug systems that were running it and doing the same thing
3709000	3711000	Can't Sony patch this out
3711000	3713000	In minutes?
3713000	3715000	No because it's the same tool that they use to fix
3715000	3717000	Their consoles so
3717000	3719000	They can't really patch it out because it would fuck up
3719000	3721000	I think developer consoles or something like that
3721000	3723000	Or if they did
3723000	3725000	Basically what they would have to do
3725000	3727000	Is ban a certain
3727000	3729000	USB ID or something like that
3729000	3731000	So that it would detect
3731000	3733000	Okay this is this card
3733000	3735000	So we're going to make it so that
3735000	3737000	You can't run this anymore
3737000	3739000	But all they can do is they update the firmware
3739000	3741000	On that card and they can change that ID
3741000	3743000	Or whatever
3743000	3745000	So I don't
3745000	3747000	They say that there's no way to ban it
3747000	3749000	And I'd be willing to bet though that
3749000	3751000	I mean they may patch it
3751000	3753000	And they may fix it again
3753000	3755000	With the PSP or the DS or the Wii
3755000	3757000	Or anything
3757000	3759000	They put out patches to fix things
3759000	3761000	And fix loopholes
3761000	3763000	But it may be too hard
3763000	3765000	And on the other thing too
3765000	3767000	What this is supposed to do is
3767000	3769000	It will also disable forced updates
3769000	3771000	Forced system updates
3771000	3773000	So for example
3773000	3775000	Newer software that comes out has the newer system versions
3775000	3777000	And stuff like that
3777000	3779000	And you can actually disable it from updating your system
3779000	3781000	So if you're playing offline
3781000	3783000	I don't know
3783000	3785000	It would be interesting to watch
3785000	3787000	Because now the one console system
3787000	3789000	That was the most secure
3789000	3791000	Has now been cracked wide open
3791000	3793000	It would be interesting to see
3793000	3795000	Vidpower in our chatroom says
3795000	3797000	What is with the term jailbreaking
3797000	3799000	Being used for everything that involves hacking?
3799000	3801000	You know the iPhones use that term too
3801000	3803000	I don't know
3803000	3805000	It's a clever term
3805000	3807000	And it caught on
3807000	3809000	It's a buzzword
3809000	3811000	It's trendy
3811000	3813000	It kind of makes sense for the iPhone
3813000	3815000	But it's trendy so everyone wants to use it now
3815000	3817000	I'm thinking about jailbreaking my phone
3817000	3819000	Just so I can downgrade the stupid OS
3819000	3821000	I hate iOS 4 on a 3G
3821000	3823000	Supposedly there's a patch coming
3823000	3825000	But we've been waiting what
3825000	3827000	Two months?
3827000	3829000	Actually I just updated the patch
3829000	3831000	On my 3GS
3831000	3833000	And I've noticed it running a little bit better
3833000	3835000	3GS's are different though
3835000	3837000	I know but I'm saying
3837000	3839000	It could have included some fixes
3839000	3841000	I'm not going to hold my breath
3841000	3843000	But I will get excited about this
3843000	3845000	I'm very excited about this announcement
3845000	3847000	Well of sorts
3847000	3849000	It's about the game Torchlight
3849000	3851000	Which is a little kind of PC
3851000	3853000	I don't know if you want to say indie game
3853000	3855000	It's by Runic Games which is made up
3855000	3857000	Of a lot of people who were with Blizzard
3857000	3859000	At one time or what have you
3859000	3861000	But it's a cool game one way or the other
3861000	3863000	If you like Diablo 2 this is a great kind of holdover
3863000	3865000	While you wait for Diablo 3
3865000	3867000	Torchlight
3867000	3869000	Originally they wanted to put Torchlight on Xbox Live Arcade
3869000	3871000	But they actually
3871000	3873000	I guess kind of held off for whatever reason
3873000	3875000	Didn't end up doing it
3875000	3877000	But now they're apparently putting serious effort
3877000	3879000	Into actually making a console version of Torchlight
3879000	3881000	And it was announced at Gamescom
3881000	3883000	By the Runic CEO Max Schaeffer
3883000	3885000	Quote, we're trying
3885000	3887000	We're talking to Sony and Microsoft
3887000	3889000	And we hope to get that done quickly
3889000	3891000	And they want to have it available by the holidays
3891000	3893000	Just so you know this game
3893000	3895000	Has actually already moved about 750,000 units
3895000	3897000	So it's already almost sold close to a million
3897000	3899000	Which isn't bad for a game like this
3899000	3901000	That's been mostly digital distribution
3901000	3903000	I know I got it on one of those crazy
3903000	3905000	Steam sales
3905000	3907000	And I'm sure a lot of you guys did
3907000	3909000	As well
3909000	3911000	Get it that way
3911000	3913000	Piracy apparently has been an issue with this game
3913000	3915000	Unfortunately
3915000	3917000	So they can't track how many illegal copies are going on out there
3917000	3919000	But seeing as Torchlight 2
3919000	3921000	Is going to be multiplayer
3921000	3923000	Especially if this does go to Xbox Live and so forth
3923000	3925000	They'll have that to think about
3925000	3927000	They'll be able to track that a little better
3927000	3929000	There's also a Torchlight MMO
3929000	3931000	Happening at some point
3931000	3933000	So we'll see
3933000	3935000	It'll be interesting though if Torchlight goes to Xbox Live
3935000	3937000	And PSN because it's only single player
3937000	3939000	One of its biggest drawbacks is there isn't really multiplayer in it
3939000	3941000	That's why they're doing Torchlight 2
3941000	3943000	And a lot of the games on
3943000	3945000	Xbox Live Arcade and Playstation Network
3945000	3947000	Really thrive on a multiplayer environment
3947000	3949000	Not all of them, like what, Mega Man 9
3949000	3951000	Is it really multiplayer?
3951000	3953000	There's other stuff out there that doesn't
3953000	3955000	Have to be multiplayer
3955000	3957000	But uh
3957000	3959000	It'll be very cool to have a Diablo style game
3959000	3961000	On Xbox Live I think
3961000	3963000	I don't know, what do you think? You're a fan of Torchlight, right Alan?
3963000	3965000	What do you think of this game moving to the
3965000	3967000	Consoles?
3967000	3969000	Whatever will help it get a larger audience
3969000	3971000	So that when, if the MMO
3971000	3973000	When it does come out
3973000	3975000	It'll succeed, then I'm all for it
3975000	3977000	Alright
3977000	3979000	Let's move on to some more gaming news
3979000	3981000	Then we'll get to some release dates, StarkSakra
3981000	3983000	Well
3983000	3985000	You know how some places
3985000	3987000	Have these archaic laws on the books
3987000	3989000	Like, in Alabama it's illegal
3989000	3991000	To walk around with an ice cream cone in your back pocket
3991000	3993000	Did you know that?
3993000	3995000	Now I wanna go and just do it
3995000	3997000	I don't know if you can walk around with an ice cream cone in your back pocket
3997000	3999000	With a crunch
3999000	4001000	It's possible, but it gets soggy
4001000	4003000	Well, the city of Beacon, New York
4003000	4005000	Has one that says
4005000	4007000	That there can't be pinball
4007000	4009000	Tables, they're illegal there
4009000	4011000	And now they're enforcing it
4011000	4013000	They've shut down
4013000	4015000	A retro arcade
4015000	4017000	You cut out for a minute
4017000	4019000	They shut down a retro arcade
4019000	4021000	Didn't pinball
4021000	4023000	Used to be associated with gambling
4023000	4025000	In the mafia and things like that
4025000	4027000	Years and years ago, so maybe that's where the law came from
4027000	4029000	And, you know, them darn kids
4029000	4031000	Um, the mayor of Beacon
4031000	4033000	You might have to switch mics
4033000	4035000	The mayor of Beacon said it was
4035000	4037000	Is this better?
4037000	4039000	Yes
4039000	4041000	Okay, they said it was about noise
4041000	4043000	That people complained about the noise
4043000	4045000	And blah blah blah blah blah
4045000	4047000	And so they said
4047000	4049000	Well, we'll just use this law
4049000	4051000	As a convenient excuse to enforce
4051000	4053000	The noise thing
4053000	4055000	Which is bull
4055000	4057000	I mean, seriously?
4057000	4059000	I know, I would actually like to see
4059000	4061000	What other businesses are around the people
4061000	4063000	That supposedly complained
4063000	4065000	So
4065000	4067000	You know, I think it was on CNN
4067000	4069000	Or one of the news channels
4069000	4071000	They were actually showing this place
4071000	4073000	And it actually looked kind of cool
4073000	4075000	And I'm thinking, like, I've never heard of this town
4075000	4077000	Until this happened, but
4077000	4079000	There was this place there that I thought
4079000	4081000	I might want to visit someday
4081000	4083000	But now I guess I can't
4083000	4085000	It's kind of a bummer
4085000	4087000	Because this place is somewhat unique
4087000	4089000	And I bet they would have had visitors
4089000	4091000	I don't know how far it is from New York City
4091000	4093000	But I bet there would have been folks in that
4093000	4095000	New York area that might take a trip out
4095000	4097000	To upstate someday to go take a look at it
4097000	4099000	But obviously they can't now
4099000	4101000	They're shooting themselves in the foot
4101000	4103000	And the guy's saying
4103000	4105000	We tried to help them save their business
4105000	4107000	And find them other locations
4107000	4109000	And use decibel tests to be objective
4109000	4111000	And blah blah blah
4111000	4113000	It's just crap
4113000	4115000	The loudest thing that happens
4115000	4117000	When I play pinball is when
4117000	4119000	I miss and I go, God damn it
4119000	4121000	And I'm just yelling
4121000	4123000	At the table
4123000	4125000	Do you think maybe that's what happened there?
4125000	4127000	Was just an outbreak of people saying, God damn it, shit
4127000	4129000	You know, if they had good carpeting
4129000	4131000	It would have totally muted the noise
4131000	4133000	There used to be
4133000	4135000	There was a little tiny arcade
4135000	4137000	Out in Roseville called Supercade
4137000	4139000	Years and years ago, run by this old gentleman
4139000	4141000	That sadly he got put out of business
4141000	4143000	He was in the middle of a strip mall
4143000	4145000	He had tons of pinball games and arcade games
4145000	4147000	And he never
4147000	4149000	Got noise complaints
4149000	4151000	Or what have you
4151000	4153000	There's people that own retro arcade tables
4153000	4155000	And have them out in the Galleria
4155000	4157000	In a hallway
4157000	4159000	So in the Danos
4159000	4161000	Interesting
4161000	4163000	Alright, well let's start to travel the world
4163000	4165000	And take a look at some release dates
4165000	4167000	And hopefully these games will not be banned
4167000	4169000	In your local city
4169000	4171000	Yes, not a whole lot
4171000	4173000	Coming out this week
4173000	4175000	But there's some pretty good stuff
4175000	4177000	Let's just start with the stuff
4177000	4179000	Not necessarily the good stuff
4179000	4181000	Martian Panic
4181000	4183000	From Zoo Games
4183000	4185000	It's a generic arcade shooter game
4185000	4187000	Available with a neon green
4187000	4189000	Shotgun, or by itself
4189000	4191000	Those of course on the Wii
4191000	4193000	Nancy Drew, Secrets Can Kill 2010
4193000	4195000	Coming out on PC
4195000	4197000	Umm...
4197000	4199000	Elemental War of Magic
4199000	4201000	On PC as well from
4201000	4203000	Stardock
4203000	4205000	Oh god, I forgot this was coming out
4205000	4207000	Because
4207000	4209000	Someone thought it was a great idea to put
4209000	4211000	Grease the musical
4211000	4213000	Or like the sing-along version of it
4213000	4215000	I guess, in theaters
4215000	4217000	There's Grease the video game
4217000	4219000	Coming out on Wii and DS
4219000	4221000	Where you can sing and dance with the
4221000	4223000	Casts of Grease
4223000	4225000	In opportunity form
4225000	4227000	Fun
4227000	4229000	This is pretty cool
4229000	4231000	Gunblade NYC
4231000	4233000	And L.A. Machine Guns
4233000	4235000	A game I seriously played tons of
4235000	4237000	Back in the Qsar days
4237000	4239000	Coming to the Wii as well
4239000	4241000	For a wonderful $30 retail price
4241000	4243000	Just like that House of the Dead 2 and 3 collection
4243000	4245000	It should be pretty fun
4245000	4247000	Gotta go back and play Ghost Squad some more
4247000	4249000	That's some fun stuff
4249000	4251000	Umm...
4251000	4253000	Dead Edition will also be coming out this week as well
4253000	4255000	Umm...
4255000	4257000	Mafia 2 on Playstation 3
4257000	4259000	And Xbox 360
4259000	4261000	And PC this week
4261000	4263000	Umm...
4263000	4265000	That game from 2K
4265000	4267000	Harvest Moon Grand Bazaar on DS this week
4267000	4269000	Here's a game for Rob
4269000	4271000	Hello Kitty Online
4271000	4273000	Coming out on PC this week
4273000	4275000	Yay! Wait, I thought this had been out for a while
4275000	4277000	Well, apparently it's the disc version
4277000	4279000	Of the game
4279000	4281000	It's just digital before you
4281000	4283000	NHL 2K11 on the Wii
4283000	4285000	Coming out this week
4285000	4287000	Ivy the Kiwi
4287000	4289000	On DS and Wii this week
4289000	4291000	The Bachelor
4291000	4293000	The video game
4293000	4295000	Okay, wait, you've said that game like three times
4295000	4297000	It's been delayed a ton of times, okay
4297000	4299000	I wonder why
4299000	4301000	Because it's a terrible, terrible game
4301000	4303000	I think they just want you to keep announcing it every week
4303000	4305000	So they keep delaying it one week at a time
4305000	4307000	You know that they are putting out an amazing race game
4307000	4309000	When I was in Reno, I played an amazing race slot machine
4309000	4311000	That was actually really cool
4311000	4313000	It was like a high budget thing
4313000	4315000	It had a huge subwoofer in it
4315000	4317000	It had Phil
4317000	4319000	That's all you need
4319000	4321000	It was a nice slot machine
4321000	4323000	And the one at Calneva
4323000	4325000	I won a ton of money on
4325000	4327000	Well, not a ton, for pennies I won a ton of money
4327000	4329000	But the one at Eldorado ripped me off
4329000	4331000	So just a word to the wise
4331000	4333000	That go to Reno to do their gaming
4333000	4335000	Go play at Calneva because their slots are looser
4335000	4337000	Yeah, The Bachelor video game
4337000	4339000	Eventually is going to come out at some point
4339000	4341000	Then making way for probably more crappier games
4341000	4343000	Oh, actually I know it's making way for more crappier games
4343000	4345000	Like Survivor and Minute to Win It
4345000	4347000	And
4347000	4349000	Pretty much any game show that's on TV now
4349000	4351000	Is going to have a game based on it
4351000	4353000	And it's going to be on the Wii
4353000	4355000	Because that's what they do
4355000	4357000	Battlefield Bad Company 2
4357000	4359000	The Ultimate Edition
4359000	4361000	A re-release with a bunch of download content
4361000	4363000	And fun download content for
4363000	4365000	Battlefield 1943
4365000	4367000	As well
4367000	4369000	Or 1942, I don't remember which game it is
4369000	4371000	Anyways, that's on
4371000	4373000	PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360
4373000	4375000	Ghost Pirate of Vuju Island
4375000	4377000	On PC, some value game there
4377000	4379000	From Disney
4379000	4381000	Guilty Party
4381000	4383000	Kind of like a clue type of game
4383000	4385000	That's on the Wii
4385000	4387000	Yeah, we talked about that a little while ago
4387000	4389000	This time it's actually coming out
4389000	4391000	Camp Rock the Final Jam on DS
4391000	4393000	A new movie
4393000	4395000	Ace Combat Joint Assault on PSP
4395000	4397000	Valkria Chronicles 2
4397000	4399000	On PSP as well
4399000	4405000	Game called Cosmo's Chaos on the DS
4405000	4407000	Of course, the big one this week
4407000	4409000	Metroid Other M, coming out on the Wii
4409000	4411000	And
4413000	4415000	And I believe that's it
4415000	4417000	Oh, no, there's a couple other crappier games here
4417000	4419000	At the very end
4419000	4421000	Valkria on the DS, my first dollhouse on the DS
4421000	4423000	And Prison Tycoon in Alcatraz on PC
4423000	4425000	Prison Tycoon in Alcatraz, wow
4425000	4427000	Chat.orangewonnagevideo.com
4427000	4429000	More comments from the chat room
4429000	4431000	Brakeman in our chat says
4431000	4433000	Yay, amazing race! Wait, what's the amazing race?
4433000	4435000	It's a TV show
4435000	4437000	Here
4437000	4439000	I thought they had it in other countries, maybe not
4439000	4441000	But it's like teams of two that go around the world
4441000	4443000	And it literally is a race
4443000	4445000	They pick up clues
4445000	4447000	It's like, I don't want to say a scavenger hunt
4447000	4449000	What's the other kind of game?
4449000	4451000	Isn't there a game that people
4451000	4453000	can play where you go from point A to point B
4453000	4455000	and pick up clues along the way? I don't know what the name for that is
4455000	4457000	But that's the reason why it is
4457000	4459000	You do tasks at every
4459000	4461000	point in every city and you move on and the winner gets a million bucks
4461000	4463000	It's a show
4463000	4465000	And let's see
4465000	4467000	Chat.orangewonnagevideo.com more comments
4467000	4469000	Where's the mole game? asks Frisbee
4469000	4471000	Excellent question
4471000	4473000	That was the best reality show they ever did
4473000	4475000	Monty Boggs says, how come Big Brother Wii
4475000	4477000	doesn't sound appealing to me?
4477000	4479000	Because you're not trashy
4479000	4481000	They still may do that
4481000	4483000	If the Survivor game sells, why not?
4483000	4485000	They had, was it
4485000	4487000	America's Top...
4487000	4489000	Do they have America's Top Model?
4489000	4491000	They had America's Top Model
4491000	4493000	What other
4493000	4495000	crappy games did they have?
4495000	4497000	Wipeout
4497000	4499000	They had a thing for that
4499000	4501000	I get Minute to Win it because they're just going to do
4501000	4503000	Wii versions of all those stupid games
4503000	4505000	they play on that show
4505000	4507000	Let's go to Target, the game
4507000	4509000	and buy paper cups and ping pong balls
4509000	4511000	and pay somebody a million dollars
4511000	4513000	to do the tricks
4513000	4515000	I'm surprised they don't have a home game yet
4515000	4517000	I believe it's coming out
4517000	4519000	if it's not already out
4519000	4521000	It's not hard to do
4521000	4523000	a home version of Minute to Win it
4523000	4525000	Go to the dollar store
4525000	4527000	Exactly, dollar store the game
4527000	4529000	SSG100Matt says
4529000	4531000	Robin Allen should be on The Amazing Race
4531000	4533000	I'm a Robin Jamie
4533000	4535000	Actually, I don't know how Allen feels about being on Network TV
4535000	4537000	like The Amazing Race, but I gotta say, me and my friend Victoria
4537000	4539000	have been talking about it for at least two years
4539000	4541000	how badly we need to go on The Amazing Race
4541000	4543000	I don't drive, and there's usually
4543000	4545000	you know, you have to get into
4545000	4547000	a jeep and one person does something
4547000	4549000	while the other person drives
4549000	4551000	and I couldn't do that
4551000	4553000	My favorite task I ever saw on The Amazing Race
4553000	4555000	was when they were in Thailand
4555000	4557000	and they had to get in these taxis
4557000	4559000	but they're karaoke taxis
4559000	4561000	Thai karaoke songs from point A to point B
4561000	4563000	or whatever, but they were actually
4563000	4565000	singing with women
4565000	4567000	in the back seat, but they were actually female
4567000	4569000	impersonators, and some of the teams
4569000	4571000	didn't even catch on to it
4571000	4573000	that they were singing with
4573000	4575000	Taiwan Asian female impersonators
4575000	4577000	Was there like a bro team
4577000	4579000	asking for their number?
4579000	4581000	You know there was, they showed it on TV
4581000	4583000	but the challenge cracked me up
4583000	4585000	I do free Xenocord
4585000	4587000	they do need a supermarket sweep game
4587000	4589000	I thought there was one
4589000	4591000	a while ago, a supermarket sweep game
4591000	4593000	like on PC or something
4593000	4595000	I love that game
4595000	4597000	watching that on, what was it, Lifetime?
4597000	4599000	Also, Press Your Luck
4599000	4601000	there is a Press Your Luck game on Wii
4601000	4603000	and I think there's another one coming out this year too
4603000	4605000	Yeah, there's Press Your Luck, A Price is Right
4605000	4607000	There's a new Wheel of Fortune game
4607000	4609000	New Jeopardy
4609000	4611000	A lot of those game shows
4611000	4613000	are actually out
4613000	4615000	I don't know how good they are
4615000	4617000	I seem to remember
4617000	4619000	X-Link called into the show some time ago
4619000	4621000	and he's told me about it since then
4621000	4623000	that the Press Your Luck game is surprisingly not bad
4623000	4625000	I mean, you get what you pay for
4625000	4627000	Right? I mean, if you buy a
4627000	4629000	Press Your Luck game, you know exactly what game
4629000	4631000	you're buying
4631000	4633000	It's not a big surprise
4633000	4635000	Is it responsive?
4635000	4637000	Do the questions repeat after
4637000	4639000	playing it three times?
4639000	4641000	That's all you really need, right?
4641000	4643000	You know what you're buying when you buy the Press Your Luck home game
4643000	4645000	Alright, let's get to the Japanese release dates
4645000	4647000	Enough about game shows. I could talk all day about game shows
4647000	4649000	I love game shows
4649000	4651000	In fact, I would love to see
4651000	4653000	the Sherri Shepherd version of the Newlywed game
4653000	4655000	because you know she's going to make a great house
4655000	4657000	Comment about the American X-Top Model game
4657000	4659000	Didn't sell well because no matter
4659000	4661000	what you did, Tyra got a better score
4661000	4663000	than you and then she yelled at you
4663000	4665000	So that didn't sell well
4669000	4671000	So here's a question though
4671000	4673000	What would happen if you had Tyra play
4673000	4675000	the America's Top Model game?
4675000	4677000	Now would it go into an infinite loop like
4677000	4679000	the Tic Tac Show game in WarGames?
4679000	4681000	If she still had her show
4681000	4683000	she would have used this opportunity to see
4683000	4685000	Now me, and here's my game
4685000	4687000	I had so much fun recording this
4687000	4689000	I had so much fun doing my game
4689000	4691000	The Tyra show really was the Tyra show
4691000	4693000	It was about Tyra
4693000	4695000	She could be doing a whole show on anorexia
4695000	4697000	and bulimia and one time she'd be like
4697000	4699000	I remember this one time when I was at a restaurant
4699000	4701000	and I didn't want to eat what was in front of me
4701000	4703000	and I found that to be so hard
4703000	4705000	I cried that I had the salad
4705000	4707000	and it was very devastating to me emotionally
4713000	4715000	Let's go to Japanese release dates
4715000	4717000	Kane & Lynch 2 Dog Days
4717000	4719000	comes out on the 26th on the
4719000	4721000	Xbox 360 hip hip hooray
4721000	4723000	That is a Japanese release
4723000	4725000	so I don't know if they fully localized it
4725000	4727000	or what but that is coming out
4727000	4729000	They're actually played by dogs now
4729000	4731000	Now that I'd buy
4735000	4737000	That would make the Kane & Lynch series like
4737000	4739000	ten times better
4739000	4741000	if it was a gritty crime drama
4741000	4743000	with canines, dogs
4745000	4747000	Hold down R2 to scoot your butt
4753000	4755000	Alright, on the PlayStation 3
4755000	4757000	Kane & Lynch 2 Dog Days
4757000	4759000	is also coming out over there
4759000	4761000	No word if you can press R3 to poop
4761000	4763000	Agarest Zenkei Zero
4763000	4765000	compile heart selection
4765000	4767000	comes out as well
4767000	4769000	I'm imagining it's some type of compilation
4769000	4771000	It's the record of the Agarest Wars
4771000	4773000	or at least maybe a sequel to it
4773000	4775000	the one where you can breed
4775000	4777000	It is a prelude to Agarest Zenki
4777000	4779000	so it is actually a prequel
4779000	4781000	You have to breed to create the new game
4781000	4783000	That has something in common
4783000	4785000	with a dog game then
4785000	4787000	Let's see, moving to
4787000	4789000	Man, and ten dogs
4789000	4791000	would be so much cooler if they gave
4791000	4793000	the dogs guns
4793000	4795000	Don't you think?
4795000	4797000	They have a game like that
4797000	4799000	This got brought up
4799000	4801000	at my work the other day too
4801000	4803000	It would be even cooler if dogs had guns
4803000	4805000	on their back
4805000	4807000	Yeah, but they've done that
4807000	4809000	It's Metal Max
4809000	4811000	or something?
4811000	4813000	Sega was what came out over here
4813000	4815000	They have dogs
4815000	4817000	with artillery cannons on their back
4817000	4819000	Ridiculous stuff
4819000	4821000	It's awesome
4821000	4823000	Coming out on the Wii in Japan
4823000	4825000	I talked about this last week
4825000	4827000	It's coming out on the 26th
4827000	4829000	Twinkle Queen comes out on
4829000	4831000	the Nintendo Wii
4831000	4833000	What kind of game do you think Twinkle Queen is, Alan?
4833000	4835000	I don't know, but I'm still waiting for my royalty check
4837000	4839000	I think it's Twinkle Star Sprites
4839000	4841000	It is
4841000	4843000	Here's the description
4861000	4863000	So is Carmen Sandiego coming back?
4863000	4865000	I don't think it's those types of PC games
4865000	4867000	I don't think of Laidback and
4867000	4869000	Tea Drinker as the same
4869000	4871000	I think of tight-assed
4871000	4873000	and ramrod straight
4873000	4875000	back Tea Drinker
4875000	4877000	being proper
4877000	4879000	Character themes and other background music will be imported from the
4879000	4881000	originals and rearranged for Twinkle Queen
4881000	4883000	A maximum of four players
4883000	4885000	can play the game at a time
4885000	4887000	So I love it, it's PC games
4887000	4889000	but it's coming out on the Wii
4889000	4891000	I'm looking at the screenshots and I don't see Carmen Sandiego
4891000	4893000	but I do see a lot of
4893000	4895000	scantily clad women
4895000	4897000	from Katamari Damacy
4897000	4899000	She's there
4899000	4901000	I think it would be laid back if your tea was laced with something
4901000	4903000	Isn't that the Queen from Katamari Damacy?
4903000	4905000	Yes it is
4905000	4907000	Is this a Romco Bandai game?
4907000	4909000	No, it's from Milestone
4909000	4911000	Maybe they licensed it or something
4911000	4913000	I swear that looks like the Queen from Katamari Damacy
4913000	4915000	No, she's wearing a kimono
4915000	4917000	So is it a fighting game?
4917000	4919000	It's probably something behind her head
4919000	4921000	Interesting
4921000	4923000	Oh well
4923000	4925000	Chicks beating each other up
4925000	4927000	We haven't seen that before
4927000	4929000	Actually we have
4929000	4931000	Nah, it's a joke
4931000	4933000	We've seen it tons of times
4933000	4935000	That's why I'm joking
4935000	4937000	Alright, anyhow, moving on to the handhelds
4937000	4939000	There's nothing on PlayStation 2
4939000	4941000	just so you know
4941000	4943000	On the Sony PSP
4943000	4945000	Ace Combat
4945000	4947000	Joint Assault
4947000	4949000	Hakioki Zusoruku
4949000	4951000	Portable comes out this week
4951000	4953000	from Idea Factory
4953000	4955000	I don't know what this game is
4955000	4957000	This is an adventure game
4957000	4959000	that
4959000	4961000	I don't know
4961000	4963000	This chick's cuddling with her blanket
4963000	4965000	in one of the cutscenes
4965000	4967000	Looks very dating sim
4967000	4969000	This looks like a girl dating sim game
4969000	4971000	Aren't these all boys trying to be her suitor?
4971000	4973000	Maybe that's what it is
4973000	4975000	Suitor, sperm donor
4975000	4977000	We got the bachelor here
4977000	4979000	We got that there
4979000	4981000	Monhoniki
4981000	4983000	Poka Poka Ailoumura
4983000	4985000	That's what she's hoping for
4985000	4987000	That's coming out from Capcom
4987000	4989000	I'm trying to see what game
4989000	4991000	it is, if it's something we would know here
4991000	4993000	You guys recognize this game?
4995000	4997000	They look like the characters from Animal Crossing
4997000	4999000	Don't they?
4999000	5001000	This is like a PSP version of Animal Crossing
5001000	5003000	No it's not
5003000	5005000	It's the little
5005000	5007000	I think ascii cat people
5007000	5009000	They kind of look like Doraemon
5009000	5011000	A little bit
5011000	5013000	They have ears
5013000	5015000	Interesting
5015000	5017000	Quickly on the DS
5017000	5019000	Sorry I'm taking a long time here
5019000	5021000	On the Nintendo DS
5021000	5023000	Nothing really notable
5023000	5025000	that comes out this week
5025000	5027000	Unfortunately
5027000	5029000	So there you go
5029000	5031000	Those are your Japanese release dates
5031000	5033000	Let's go to jolly old England
5033000	5035000	and talk about their releases
5035000	5037000	On the 24th we have Grease for Wii and DS
5037000	5039000	On the 24th we also have Gunblade New York
5039000	5041000	and L.A. Machine Guns Arcade
5041000	5043000	I'm a big fan of Gunblade New York
5043000	5045000	for the record
5045000	5047000	We also have Ivy the Kiwi
5047000	5049000	It's got a question mark at the end
5049000	5051000	So it's Ivy the Kiwi
5051000	5053000	It's coming out here
5053000	5055000	You have cut out yet again
5055000	5057000	Live radio folks
5057000	5059000	We have Ivy the Kiwi
5059000	5061000	Kiwi
5061000	5063000	Shank
5063000	5065000	Game vs. the World
5065000	5067000	and Shank again on Xbox 360
5067000	5069000	On the 27th we have Mafia 2
5069000	5071000	for PC, PS3, and 360
5073000	5075000	Alright
5075000	5077000	That's it
5077000	5079000	A few more news stories for you guys
5079000	5081000	in the classic game of the week
5081000	5083000	Sony has been ordered to pay 5 million yen
5083000	5085000	to a former Sony employee
5085000	5087000	who is named
5087000	5089000	Looks like
5089000	5091000	Hiro Kume
5091000	5093000	and he invented
5093000	5095000	I guess a small optical pickup
5095000	5097000	that was used to read and write discs
5097000	5099000	in the Playstation 2 and the original Playstation
5099000	5101000	Of course he felt that
5101000	5103000	Sony didn't recognize his contributions
5103000	5105000	and he took them to court
5105000	5107000	and he won
5107000	5109000	So that's not bad
5109000	5111000	and it roughly translates to
5111000	5113000	about $60,000
5113000	5115000	is what he won
5115000	5117000	and he says
5117000	5119000	I thank the court for identifying
5119000	5121000	some of my contributions to the company
5121000	5123000	but the company should have appreciated
5123000	5125000	my contributions when I was an employee
5127000	5129000	Ouch
5129000	5131000	Scathing a little bit
5131000	5133000	Speaking of lawsuits
5133000	5135000	This guy
5135000	5137000	Craig Smallwood apparently is his name
5137000	5139000	sued the makers of Lineage
5139000	5141000	He wants
5141000	5143000	basically them to fess up to the fact
5143000	5145000	that their game is too damn addicting
5145000	5147000	in so many words
5147000	5149000	that Lineage 2 specifically is so addicting
5149000	5151000	that he is quote
5151000	5153000	unable to function independently in usual daily activities
5153000	5155000	such as getting up, getting undressed,
5155000	5157000	bathing or communicating with family and friends
5157000	5159000	Apparently he played the game
5159000	5161000	for 20,000 hours
5161000	5163000	between 2004 and 2009
5163000	5165000	That's like literally
5165000	5167000	half of every single day
5167000	5169000	playing Lineage 2
5169000	5171000	Hmm
5171000	5173000	Apparently it's negligence
5173000	5175000	and gross negligence there
5175000	5177000	I think Bobby was talking about this story on his show too
5177000	5179000	and he found through some other resources I guess
5179000	5181000	that the guy was actually running a gold farming service
5181000	5183000	in this game
5183000	5185000	because you'll notice
5185000	5187000	he played for 20,000 hours between 2004 and 2009
5187000	5189000	Doesn't really point out why he stopped
5189000	5191000	So is he really addicted to the game
5191000	5193000	or is he just a jilted gold farmer?
5193000	5195000	I don't know
5195000	5197000	It seems like a combination of
5197000	5199000	I don't know, OCD
5199000	5201000	that could be a legitimate situation that he was in
5201000	5203000	but also he had
5203000	5205000	I guess from when we were listening to
5205000	5207000	Bobby Blackwolf's show
5207000	5209000	he had three accounts that he was using to gold farm
5209000	5211000	Maybe he realized that his return on investment
5211000	5213000	was so much better the more
5213000	5215000	hours he logged into each of his three accounts
5215000	5217000	and that's what got him
5217000	5219000	addicted
5219000	5221000	I have to play 12 hours a day
5221000	5223000	because then I'll make $100 this week
5223000	5225000	and uh
5225000	5227000	that could be it
5227000	5229000	Well let's just assume that wasn't
5229000	5231000	even all a factor
5231000	5233000	and that's off the table for a minute here
5233000	5235000	We're just talking about somebody suing
5235000	5237000	the makers of the game they've become addicted to
5237000	5239000	because their game is too addicting
5239000	5241000	I mean, really? Does that mean I can sue
5241000	5243000	McDonald's because I'm addicted to Chicken McNuggets
5243000	5245000	and they made me fat?
5245000	5247000	They've tried, people have tried
5247000	5249000	Really? What a country
5249000	5251000	I know, it's ridiculous
5251000	5253000	The whole thing is coming down to lack of self control
5253000	5255000	You know, I love Star Trek Online
5255000	5257000	You know how much I love the damn game
5257000	5259000	Guess who doesn't stay logged into it
5259000	5261000	for more than two hours at a time
5261000	5263000	That would be me
5263000	5265000	Even if my friends in the UK are on
5265000	5267000	I log off
5267000	5269000	As much as I love talking to them
5269000	5271000	You know, when I was playing
5271000	5273000	Ragnarok
5273000	5275000	Maybe I would leave it on to vend
5275000	5277000	But I would walk away from my computer
5277000	5279000	You know
5279000	5281000	It's addiction
5281000	5283000	Well not really addiction
5283000	5285000	There's no
5285000	5287000	Now the only thing that I could remotely say
5287000	5289000	of physical effect is
5289000	5291000	This is getting into a little bit
5291000	5293000	of chemical psychology
5293000	5295000	Is what stimulates the pleasure centers of the brain
5295000	5297000	And that does become addicting
5297000	5299000	You know, for example
5299000	5301000	Love has the same effect
5301000	5303000	in the brain that cocaine can
5303000	5305000	You know
5305000	5307000	And that's the only way
5307000	5309000	I can see any kind of addiction
5309000	5311000	possibly forming
5311000	5313000	But that's where the self control
5313000	5315000	comes in
5315000	5317000	It may be hard
5317000	5319000	But you have to take some time for yourself
5319000	5321000	Get away from the game
5321000	5323000	I don't know what Lineage 2 has in place
5323000	5325000	It's not a game I've played
5325000	5327000	I played it at E3 a few years ago
5327000	5329000	And have a can of coke in my vault
5329000	5331000	Oh
5331000	5333000	Was that the game that gave away the soda?
5333000	5335000	This was years ago
5335000	5337000	I think I remember it now
5337000	5339000	It wasn't a bad game
5339000	5341000	It's way more popular
5341000	5343000	in Asia than it is here
5343000	5345000	Way more popular
5345000	5347000	Wow is the US game
5347000	5349000	Lineage and Lineage 2 are twice that
5349000	5351000	what it is here
5351000	5353000	I recognize the
5353000	5355000	art style on this can
5355000	5357000	The character creation
5357000	5359000	Lineage is a huge game over there
5359000	5361000	I believe this gentleman lives in Hawaii
5361000	5363000	So Hawaii gets
5363000	5365000	a little bit of a blending of both cultures
5365000	5367000	a lot of times
5367000	5369000	Lineage probably has a pretty good fan base
5369000	5371000	Certainly has its players
5371000	5373000	here in the continental US too
5373000	5375000	I don't know
5375000	5377000	It's just a lot of other
5377000	5379000	games I've played
5379000	5381000	Like WoW
5381000	5383000	I joke that I'm addicted to WoW
5383000	5385000	But at the end of the day, for instance
5385000	5387000	Alan and I went to Reno this weekend
5387000	5389000	And we walked away
5389000	5391000	Believe it or not, we're okay
5391000	5393000	We're gonna run our daily the minute we get home
5393000	5395000	But we're okay
5395000	5397000	There have been times in WoW where it's like
5397000	5399000	maybe midnight, 1am
5399000	5401000	Daily, rep, whatever, BS
5401000	5403000	And I'm not tired yet
5403000	5405000	But I'm just on my mount
5405000	5407000	doing laps around Dalaran
5407000	5409000	And I'm not really playing
5409000	5411000	I'm like, what am I doing right now?
5411000	5413000	I'm in WoW
5413000	5415000	I have nothing to do
5415000	5417000	I should just log off
5417000	5419000	And I've had moments where I just have to make myself sign off
5419000	5421000	And you're not even chatting?
5421000	5423000	Because I've done that, but it's because I'm chatting with people
5423000	5425000	Like I'll be running laps in Dalaran, but I'm also chatting
5425000	5427000	Well I'll be reading Trade or whatever
5427000	5431000	There's nothing morally redeeming about Trade Chat
5431000	5433000	Yeah, it's like 4chan, but in WoW
5433000	5435000	Pretty much
5435000	5437000	But WoW, when you log in
5437000	5439000	Well, I don't remember if WoW has it when you log in
5439000	5441000	But at least I know some of the tip screens say
5441000	5443000	Some of the loading screens will say
5443000	5445000	Remember to take everything in moderation
5445000	5447000	Including Warcraft
5447000	5449000	Final Fantasy XI had a disclaimer
5449000	5451000	You had to click every time
5451000	5453000	Don't forget your friends, family, or work
5453000	5455000	You know, this whole little spiel
5455000	5457000	Every two or three hours?
5457000	5459000	No, every time you logged into the game you had to click it
5459000	5461000	Yeah, I remember that
5461000	5463000	But I mean
5463000	5465000	It really does come back
5465000	5467000	You know, and this
5467000	5469000	I can be on AIM and get caught up in a conversation with somebody
5469000	5471000	That's one thing
5471000	5473000	You know, I could be
5473000	5475000	Online reading news articles
5475000	5477000	And get caught up in reading
5477000	5479000	Or I do it with Wikipedia all the damn time
5479000	5481000	But the whole thing is
5481000	5483000	To catch yourself
5483000	5485000	To make reminders
5485000	5487000	When you notice the time
5487000	5489000	Then
5489000	5491000	Oh crap, I've gone on too long
5491000	5493000	You know, I'll have to check this later
5493000	5495000	I don't really think
5495000	5497000	I think that maybe going like
5497000	5499000	An hour or two over
5499000	5501000	When you decided that you wanted to stop
5501000	5503000	That's kind of understandable
5503000	5505000	Getting caught up is human nature
5505000	5507000	But to make a habit of it
5507000	5509000	And to
5509000	5511000	Play to the exclusion of all else
5511000	5513000	That's when it gets unhealthy
5515000	5517000	Well, again
5517000	5519000	I don't know if he's going to be very
5519000	5521000	Successful suing the makers of the game
5521000	5523000	Because he couldn't control himself
5523000	5525000	I just think it would set a horrific precedence
5525000	5527000	You know, we could sue anything
5527000	5529000	That had a negative effect on us
5529000	5531000	I mean, it's just
5531000	5533000	You have to have some self control
5533000	5535000	It's just kind of sad that the judge wouldn't throw it out
5535000	5537000	But nope, the judge actually
5537000	5539000	Is allowing the case to proceed
5539000	5541000	That should be interesting
5541000	5543000	You know why I would think it would be a good idea
5543000	5545000	To let a case like that proceed?
5545000	5547000	So he's struck down
5547000	5549000	Setting legal precedence
5549000	5551000	I can see that
5551000	5553000	Let's see, XenaCorner in our chatroom at chat.orangelandraday.com
5553000	5555000	Says Lineage 2 is an unreal engine converted
5555000	5557000	Grinding piece of shit
5557000	5559000	Or POS, I'm assuming meaning piece of shit
5559000	5561000	Tigerclaw says
5561000	5563000	You know, Starcraft 2 can be quite addicting
5563000	5565000	The other night I was playing it late at night
5565000	5567000	And by the time I stopped it was like 5am in the morning
5567000	5569000	Yeah, well a lot of video games
5569000	5571000	I mean, Starcraft I've heard of tons of addictions
5571000	5573000	Addictions of varying degrees
5573000	5575000	Stories of that
5575000	5577000	But I'm sure there's lots of video games
5577000	5579000	Even Jamie has talked about
5579000	5581000	When you were in high school or college
5581000	5583000	You stayed out for a week to play
5583000	5585000	And granted, I did have the flu
5585000	5587000	Legitimately
5587000	5589000	But all I did was play Final Fantasy
5589000	5591000	It was Final Fantasy 3
5591000	5593000	6 over in Japan
5593000	5595000	That's the only game I've ever
5595000	5597000	You know, played
5597000	5599000	While I was that sick
5599000	5601000	You know, when I had my surgery
5601000	5603000	I played tons of Blue Dragon last time
5603000	5605000	I didn't play any games this time because my hand
5605000	5607000	Heard a different way
5607000	5609000	But I played a ton of Blue Dragon last time
5609000	5611000	You know
5611000	5613000	Big deal
5613000	5615000	I wouldn't
5615000	5617000	I played a lot of Final Fantasy 7 when I was supposed to be in college
5617000	5619000	I'd skip class from time to time
5619000	5621000	To watch Sailor Moon or play Toushinden
5621000	5623000	I mean
5623000	5625000	And when my friend
5625000	5627000	Had his
5627000	5629000	He had a Saturn before everybody else because he imported it
5629000	5631000	And I stayed up all night playing
5631000	5633000	The damn Gundam game
5633000	5635000	And King of Fighters
5635000	5637000	But that's one time
5637000	5639000	You know
5639000	5641000	Alright
5641000	5643000	Well speaking of addicting games
5643000	5645000	I think it's time for us to take a trip down memory lane
5645000	5647000	And look at some of the games of the past
5647000	5649000	And that's in a segment we call
5649000	5651000	The Classic Game of the Week
5651000	5653000	Dark Sakura is picked as an addicting game
5653000	5655000	But it's certainly one she thinks
5655000	5657000	Kicks ass
5657000	5659000	It's the Classic Game of the Week
5659000	5661000	Dark Sakura, what should the kids be worshipping this week?
5661000	5663000	The game is called Wrecka
5663000	5665000	And this game was made
5665000	5667000	For the Summer Carnival in 1992
5667000	5669000	It's a very limited
5669000	5671000	Printing of it
5671000	5673000	But it's amazing for an S game
5673000	5685000	This isn't some music
5685000	5687000	You see it's got a pretty rad soundtrack
5687000	5689000	For an S game
5689000	5691000	All I hear are the bullets
5691000	5693000	I've got the soundtrack to this
5693000	5695000	But now the game itself
5695000	5697000	Is probably one of the
5697000	5699000	I would say earlier
5699000	5701000	Games that could be considered
5701000	5703000	Bullet hell
5703000	5705000	Really I think it could be
5705000	5707000	I mean you see who in the chat room got
5707000	5709000	Freaking excited with one of our
5709000	5711000	Bullet hell fans
5711000	5713000	But
5713000	5715000	Wrecka is
5715000	5717000	Pretty damn hardcore
5717000	5719000	I mean we've got ROMs of it
5719000	5721000	You can actually buy
5721000	5723000	Let me get this site again
5723000	5725000	I think it was
5725000	5727000	Wreckaness
5727000	5729000	You can buy reproduction
5729000	5731000	Cartridges
5731000	5733000	To play on US systems
5733000	5735000	Which is pretty cool
5735000	5737000	But the game
5737000	5739000	What makes it really special is that
5739000	5741000	It is
5741000	5743000	One of the
5743000	5745000	Highest
5745000	5747000	Sprite counts
5747000	5749000	In a game at a fast pace
5749000	5751000	And you can see
5751000	5753000	While it's playing on there
5753000	5755000	It's not really so much of a flicker
5755000	5757000	It's playing pretty smoothly
5757000	5759000	On the actual system
5759000	5761000	I'm seeing some flicker but it seems like they do some tricks
5761000	5763000	With the way the bullets fly out and things
5763000	5765000	I don't know if that's just the frame rate
5765000	5767000	In a conversion to YouTube or what
5767000	5769000	But it seems like they do some
5769000	5771000	It looks really amazing the frame rate
5771000	5773000	For a NES game
5773000	5775000	On the YouTube it's blazing fast
5775000	5777000	I'm really impressed by this
5777000	5779000	It really does play that fast
5779000	5781000	The game itself
5781000	5783000	Was published by
5783000	5785000	Naxastsoft
5785000	5787000	N-A-X-A-T
5787000	5789000	In 1992 like I said for the summer
5789000	5791000	Carnival
5791000	5793000	It is a side scroller
5793000	5795000	It has
5795000	5797000	Bottom to top
5797000	5799000	Scrolling
5799000	5801000	You get all kinds
5801000	5803000	Of power ups
5803000	5805000	Modifiable power ups
5805000	5807000	The ones you wait for them to change
5807000	5809000	Or you can shoot them and they'll change
5809000	5811000	This particular stage that we're watching
5811000	5813000	This is just the second level
5813000	5815000	You go up through this tube
5815000	5817000	And then you go backwards down the tube
5817000	5819000	That's kind of rad I like that
5819000	5821000	Yeah
5821000	5823000	And the soundtrack for it
5823000	5825000	Is freaking amazing
5825000	5827000	The other
5827000	5829000	Things that you have with this too
5829000	5831000	Is that instead of having bombs
5831000	5833000	That when you stop shooting
5833000	5835000	You can build up a power surge
5835000	5837000	And deflect
5837000	5839000	Incoming fire
5839000	5841000	And then if you charge it long time
5841000	5843000	It'll clear the screen
5843000	5845000	The way a bomb would do
5845000	5847000	Um
5847000	5849000	It's really hard to do that though
5849000	5851000	Because as you can see how fast the enemies come at you
5851000	5853000	And look at the effects in the background
5853000	5855000	I mean that's very
5855000	5857000	Looks almost mode 7-ish
5857000	5859000	I should say
5859000	5861000	And this was before there was such a thing as mode 7
5861000	5863000	It has a normal
5863000	5865000	Score attack and time attack
5865000	5867000	It's single player only
5867000	5869000	Um
5869000	5871000	The game is cool
5871000	5873000	You've got five primary weapons
5873000	5875000	And then five optional weapons
5875000	5877000	Um so you get different power ups
5877000	5879000	And you can shoot different ways
5879000	5881000	It's just really really amazing
5881000	5883000	But this isn't one of the typical story
5883000	5885000	Oh you have to fight off the aliens
5885000	5887000	Blah blah save the earth
5887000	5889000	And
5889000	5891000	I think that Wrecka is just a freaking cool name
5891000	5893000	For uh
5893000	5895000	For a game that needs blazing fire
5895000	5897000	But the official name is
5897000	5899000	World Consumer Series Summer Carnival
5899000	5901000	92 Wrecka
5903000	5905000	And good luck freaking finding it
5905000	5907000	I just even love that idea of flying
5907000	5909000	Up the tunnel and then flying back down
5909000	5911000	Like you just don't see that in a lot of shooters
5911000	5913000	At least that I can think of
5913000	5915000	Usually in fact shooters are almost always
5915000	5917000	Ship is on the bottom and you're moving
5917000	5919000	Your way up
5919000	5921000	Or you rarely ever see it the other way
5921000	5923000	Rarely ever see it the other way
5923000	5925000	Around where you're flying at the top of the screen
5925000	5927000	Moving down
5927000	5929000	You know the only other game that I've seen some kind of innovation
5929000	5931000	For the standard side scrolling shooter
5931000	5933000	Was that same Gundam game that was on the Saturn
5933000	5935000	Back in the day when it came out
5935000	5937000	Because you had um three planes
5937000	5939000	You were in the middle ground
5939000	5941000	But you had foreground and background
5941000	5943000	Enemies to fight too
5943000	5945000	And now this here is stationary
5945000	5947000	Not just that as a non-standard shooter
5947000	5949000	But I always think of of course this game
5949000	5951000	We never talk enough about it here on Orange Knows Radio
5951000	5953000	One of the most underrated NES games they ever made
5953000	5955000	Was half shooter and a decent shooter at that
5955000	5957000	And then half Zelda-ish game
5957000	5959000	In fact if we do end up doing our little labor day marathon
5959000	5961000	I think we should just play the shit out of that game
5961000	5963000	And beat it
5963000	5965000	Dude I'm all for it
5965000	5967000	But yeah see that right there
5967000	5969000	Is the example of the charging move
5971000	5973000	That's a pretty sweet game for an NES game
5973000	5975000	It's just it's super rare
5975000	5977000	And that's why
5977000	5979000	Those reproduction cartridges are out
5979000	5981000	I'm actually considering
5981000	5983000	Getting one
5983000	5985000	It's supposed to be um
5985000	5987000	Let me see how much they're selling it for
5987000	5989000	On the website
5989000	5991000	I believe that if you pay
5991000	5993000	$58
5993000	5995000	That's on check or money order
5995000	5997000	Standard delivery you get
5997000	5999000	The gray cartridge
5999000	6001000	A reproduction box and a manual
6003000	6005000	It's done in our chatroom as saying that
6005000	6007000	Legend consumer series only applies to the soundtrack
6007000	6011000	It's just Summer Carnival 92 Wrecka
6011000	6013000	Well the soundtrack
6013000	6015000	Cut out
6015000	6017000	What?
6017000	6019000	The soundtrack is worth having
6019000	6021000	I found it actually to download somewhere
6021000	6023000	So
6023000	6025000	Speaking of the soundtrack go get it
6025000	6027000	The music is really sweet
6027000	6029000	Alright there it is your classic game of the week
6029000	6031000	Wrecka
6031000	6033000	Or if you want Summer Carnival 92 Wrecka
6033000	6035000	For the Nintendo Entertainment System
6035000	6037000	Good luck finding that although it does sound like you get
6037000	6039000	The reproduced cartridges
6039000	6041000	If nothing else
6041000	6043000	Somebody get me one
6043000	6045000	That's gonna do it for part A here at Orange Lounge Radio
6045000	6047000	But we're not done yet we got more news coming up in part B
6047000	6049000	We're gonna talk a little bit about Rock Band 3
6049000	6051000	Talk a little bit about Dance Central
6051000	6053000	Lots of music game news
6053000	6055000	We're gonna talk about a new drawing tablet on the Wii
6055000	6057000	Talk of course a little bit about Doctor Who
6057000	6059000	And more hacking news
6059000	6061000	And also ways to cut the lines
6061000	6063000	At PAX
6063000	6065000	We'll be interested to see what the chatters think about this story
6065000	6067000	We're gonna be getting to this
6067000	6069000	Your emails, your twitter topics and much more
6069000	6071000	Your phone calls when we come back here at the show
6071000	6073000	Where every gamer has a voice
6073000	6075000	Orange Lounge Radio
6079000	6081000	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio
6081000	6083000	We are live on this Sunday evening
6083000	6085000	August the 22nd of 2010
6085000	6087000	Where we are taping live
6087000	6089000	The 378th episode of our show
6089000	6091000	Yeah
6091000	6093000	It's been about 8 and a half years
6093000	6095000	So there you go
6095000	6097000	Lots of news coming at you here in part B
6097000	6099000	We're gonna get into that in a minute
6099000	6101000	Your twitter topics here just a few minutes away
6101000	6103000	Thought we could talk a little more about Reno
6103000	6105000	And some of the fun experiences we had up there
6105000	6107000	There's actually some interesting arcades up there
6107000	6109000	Did anything in the arcades catch your eye?
6109000	6111000	While you were up there?
6111000	6113000	We were in the big one at Circus Circus
6113000	6115000	That was mostly just you know ticket
6115000	6117000	Ticket spitters you know gambling for kids
6117000	6119000	I did see a smaller arcade
6119000	6121000	That I never got a chance to actually go into
6121000	6123000	That had a lot of Capcom stuff
6123000	6125000	Like they had MVC 2
6125000	6127000	Yeah remember when we were looking in there
6127000	6129000	You were like no that's my kind of arcade
6129000	6131000	Yeah well it's like my butt you know
6131000	6133000	I've got 10 bucks is it gonna last longer on slots
6133000	6135000	Or on arcade games
6135000	6137000	So arcade games 1
6137000	6139000	Ray Ayanami says we should have gone to Atlantis
6139000	6141000	What do they have there
6141000	6143000	Oh they probably have really
6143000	6145000	The problem with a lot of those huge huge ones
6145000	6147000	They're not downtown
6147000	6149000	The downtown ones are much easier
6149000	6151000	Because they're all kind of in the same city block
6151000	6153000	You don't have to get in the car and go whatever
6153000	6155000	Anything else interesting in Reno that you came across?
6155000	6157000	The fact that it's kind of
6157000	6159000	I don't want
6159000	6161000	How can I say this without sounding pretentious
6161000	6163000	Just Reno is
6163000	6165000	Kind of low budget
6165000	6167000	I mean that's kind of the point
6167000	6169000	If you can afford to go to Vegas
6169000	6171000	You just go to Vegas
6171000	6173000	So Reno is really kind of watered down
6173000	6175000	We had a hilariously awful
6175000	6177000	Dining experience there
6177000	6179000	Which I thought was funny considering it's
6179000	6181000	Amazing sort of you know
6181000	6183000	The El Dorado, Silver Legacy, Circus Circus
6183000	6185000	It's all one big mall they're all connected
6185000	6187000	You can just stay in that facility
6187000	6189000	So it was after Rocky
6189000	6191000	And it was around 1130 we were all starving
6191000	6193000	And exhausted
6193000	6195000	So we sat down
6195000	6197000	Not even kidding
6197000	6199000	30 minutes for her to take our order
6199000	6201000	Another 35 for our food to arrive
6201000	6203000	So we were at the table for about an hour
6203000	6205000	And the food showed up and I had joked
6205000	6207000	That when we got our receipt
6207000	6209000	For the tip section we should write
6209000	6211000	In the margin
6211000	6213000	We put your tip in that slot machine
6213000	6215000	And you should go get it
6215000	6217000	Very nice
6217000	6219000	I've taken something from my
6219000	6221000	Best friend
6221000	6223000	She leaves two cents
6223000	6225000	Yeah I've done that before
6225000	6227000	I once was in I think it was in Olive Garden
6227000	6229000	Which is why I don't like going there
6229000	6231000	Where the friend and I that I was with
6231000	6233000	It was like 7 cents
6233000	6235000	It was a very specific amount of change
6235000	6237000	To where they knew it was deliberate
6237000	6239000	Well you know it was hard though in that case
6239000	6241000	I really don't like doing that
6241000	6243000	Unless it really is clearly
6243000	6245000	This weight person's fault
6245000	6247000	But last night I don't know
6247000	6249000	I kind of got the feeling like the place was just badly managed
6249000	6251000	Like I felt like the weight person was working
6251000	6253000	I mean she was trying her best
6253000	6255000	So I didn't want to be a dick
6255000	6257000	But you know it was really bad
6257000	6259000	The food was good but yours was cold
6259000	6261000	We all had hot food but yours was cold
6261000	6263000	So that was lame
6263000	6265000	Very lame
6265000	6267000	We're going to do this real quick
6267000	6269000	I'm getting a lot of complaints in chat that we're skipping really bad
6269000	6271000	And I don't know why that would be happening
6271000	6273000	So I just want to remind everybody in studio
6273000	6275000	Take a minute to make sure you don't have anything running in the background
6275000	6277000	That could be doing bandwidth
6277000	6279000	What I'm going to do, I'm going to do a quick
6279000	6281000	Disconnect and reconnect
6281000	6283000	So for live listeners you might get dumped
6283000	6285000	Just reconnect real quick
6285000	6287000	But I'm going to see if that helps fix the problem here
6287000	6289000	I'm going to do a quick disconnect and reconnect
6289000	6291000	And see what happens here
6291000	6293000	And we're going to keep things rolling for the podcast
6293000	6295000	So just bear with us
6295000	6297000	This is what happens when you tape a show live
6297000	6299000	So we're going to disconnect right now
6299000	6301000	And so
6301000	6303000	Haha the live listeners can't hear us right now
6303000	6305000	Are there any live listeners you want to talk smack about while we're doing this?
6305000	6307000	Smack smack smack smack
6307000	6309000	Alright let's reconnect
6309000	6311000	Alright so we're reconnected so we'll see
6311000	6313000	If that hopefully helps the problem
6313000	6315000	I don't know but everything otherwise
6315000	6317000	Looks good on our end
6317000	6319000	So it could be on the all games end as well
6319000	6321000	I don't know
6321000	6323000	So we'll see
6323000	6325000	Anyhow let's move on to some rapid fire news
6325000	6327000	And all the quick little things that
6327000	6329000	You know if we had a five hour show we could talk more about
6329000	6331000	Loki
6331000	6333000	Why don't you start us off
6333000	6335000	Let's see so
6335000	6337000	There's some interesting stuff here
6337000	6339000	We'll start with
6339000	6341000	Of course
6341000	6343000	Something from Dragon Quest 9
6343000	6345000	And there was something you mentioned
6345000	6347000	Robin I don't think it was Dragon Quest
6347000	6349000	It was um
6349000	6351000	Oh I remember now
6351000	6353000	It was 3D Dot Game Heroes
6353000	6355000	There was like uh
6355000	6357000	Foo Foo or something like that
6357000	6359000	It was insinuated like you know sex or something
6359000	6361000	Yes that is um
6361000	6363000	It's one of the towns you go in and yeah
6363000	6365000	You can buy Foo Foo from somebody
6365000	6367000	For like ten dollars and it makes you
6367000	6369000	It's very very uh
6369000	6371000	Well anyways
6371000	6373000	Apparently Dragon Quest
6373000	6375000	Um
6375000	6377000	I guess this is uh
6377000	6379000	Yeah Dragon Quest 9
6379000	6381000	There's something you can um
6381000	6383000	Purchase I guess
6383000	6385000	It's Poof Poof
6385000	6387000	Or Puff Puff
6387000	6389000	I guess Puff Puff Performance
6389000	6391000	Is a quest you can unlock
6391000	6393000	And um
6393000	6395000	Apparently Puff Puff is
6395000	6397000	Interesting because
6397000	6399000	Obviously this is an
6399000	6401000	E10 game there is
6401000	6403000	No sex involved
6403000	6405000	But uh Puff Puff I guess is coming
6405000	6407000	I read this
6407000	6409000	It's uh
6409000	6411000	It comes from the Japanese word
6411000	6413000	I guess uh
6413000	6415000	Pafu Pafu
6415000	6417000	Which I guess is supposed to represent the sound
6417000	6419000	Of rubbing
6419000	6421000	One's breasts and another person's face
6421000	6423000	And that's kind of like what happens
6423000	6425000	In this thing
6425000	6427000	This French woman
6427000	6429000	With large breasts
6429000	6431000	Um convinces the player to sit down
6431000	6433000	In a chair and she blindfolds him
6433000	6435000	And then she proceeds to
6435000	6437000	Perform Puff Puff on him
6437000	6439000	Of course funny enough
6439000	6441000	It's not really her breasts rubbing against his face
6441000	6443000	But it's two slimes against his face
6443000	6445000	But still
6445000	6447000	Kind of scandalous
6447000	6449000	A little bit
6449000	6451000	Is that really the sound that makes Pafu Pafu?
6451000	6453000	Is that what they said?
6453000	6455000	I don't know. Jamie could you come over here
6455000	6457000	For a minute?
6457000	6459000	Sure
6459000	6461000	We have an experiment we need to try
6461000	6463000	Okay we're gonna put the microphone right there
6465000	6467000	It didn't sound very Pafu Pafu
6467000	6469000	Like
6469000	6471000	Boobs what do you have to say?
6471000	6473000	They don't say anything
6473000	6475000	They just sit there and look pretty
6475000	6477000	Apparently
6477000	6479000	Apparently it's in the game and it's funny
6479000	6481000	They had a funny video of it as well
6481000	6483000	Online and it's very um
6483000	6485000	Filled with
6485000	6487000	Induendo
6487000	6489000	Yeah but E10
6489000	6491000	It'd be different if it was a mature raid game
6491000	6493000	Um
6493000	6495000	Red Faction Battlegrounds
6495000	6497000	Has been announced for Xbox Live Arcade
6497000	6499000	And the Playstation Network
6499000	6501000	By THQ Digital
6501000	6503000	Is gonna be a prequel to
6503000	6505000	Red Faction Armageddon
6505000	6507000	And if
6507000	6509000	I should say if THQ has it their way
6509000	6511000	They want to put the game out for free
6511000	6513000	Or close to free as possible
6513000	6515000	Perhaps as a preorder
6515000	6517000	Like
6517000	6519000	Incentive for ordering
6519000	6521000	Red Faction Armageddon
6521000	6523000	So that sounds kind of cool
6523000	6525000	Um
6525000	6527000	And is expected to come out sometime
6527000	6529000	In 2011 probably
6529000	6531000	3 or 4 months before the game is released
6531000	6533000	Or Red Faction Armageddon is released
6533000	6535000	Um
6535000	6537000	So that's interesting
6537000	6539000	And then finally
6539000	6541000	If you're a fan of music games
6541000	6543000	And who isn't
6543000	6545000	There is a brand new browser based music game
6545000	6547000	You can check out called
6547000	6549000	Instant Jam
6549000	6551000	It comes from Instant Action
6551000	6553000	And it's a game that looks very similar
6553000	6555000	To say like a Guitar Hero
6555000	6557000	Um
6557000	6559000	You know one of those games where you have
6559000	6561000	It sounds like a very instant kind of company
6561000	6563000	Yeah like the no highway and you know the
6563000	6565000	Different things coming down
6565000	6567000	Apparently it supports your own music library
6567000	6569000	Um and it also supports
6569000	6571000	Keyboard or USB guitar
6571000	6573000	Controllers and allows for
6573000	6575000	In game music purchases as well through
6575000	6577000	Amazon or iTunes
6577000	6579000	Um I guess it's a version of download content
6581000	6583000	And uh
6583000	6585000	There is a beta currently available through Facebook
6585000	6587000	And versions um
6587000	6589000	I guess playable through the website
6589000	6591000	And embedded elsewhere
6591000	6593000	Will be rolled out soon
6593000	6595000	Alright
6595000	6597000	Well let's move on with some other
6597000	6599000	Stories here and I want to talk about
6599000	6601000	Speaking of music games, Dance Central
6601000	6603000	Has some new songs announced for it
6603000	6605000	Ten more songs announced this week
6605000	6607000	Nelly Furtado with Man Eater
6607000	6609000	Basement Jax with
6609000	6611000	Rendezvous
6611000	6613000	Benny Benassi with Satisfaction
6613000	6615000	Nina Sky with Move Ya Body
6615000	6617000	Cascada with Evacuate the Dance Floor
6617000	6619000	Pitbull with I Know You Want Me
6619000	6621000	Calle Ocho
6621000	6623000	I know you want me
6623000	6625000	I know I want ya
6625000	6627000	Sounds like Strong Bad singing
6627000	6629000	Fanny Pack with
6629000	6631000	Too bad it's not the
6631000	6633000	Fanny Pack song, Camel Toe
6633000	6635000	But it's Hey Mammy
6635000	6637000	Mammy? M-A-M-Y
6637000	6639000	Mammy? Mammy is
6639000	6641000	M-O-M-M-Y
6641000	6643000	Depends on if it's a name
6643000	6645000	Or another language
6645000	6647000	Roriana has Pond to Replay
6647000	6649000	Cool and the Gang
6649000	6651000	Jungle Boogie
6651000	6653000	Technotronic with Pump Up the Jam
6653000	6655000	And Kylie Minogue
6655000	6657000	with Can't Get You Out of My Head
6657000	6659000	That was a fun song when it was in DDR
6659000	6661000	like years and years ago
6661000	6663000	I was going to say there were some
6663000	6665000	other songs as well
6665000	6667000	I can confirm that are going to be in the game
6667000	6669000	In fact I'm looking
6669000	6671000	Oh is it the whole lyric spill thing that happened?
6671000	6673000	No, no, not even
6673000	6675000	More scandalous than that
6675000	6677000	This is
6677000	6679000	This is Wonderful People
6679000	6681000	Shouldn't be in places that they are
6681000	6683000	Are they naughty people that have already gotten copies
6683000	6685000	of the game somehow? They're naughty people that have
6685000	6687000	gotten copies of the beta that's on
6687000	6689000	Partner Net right now
6689000	6691000	Of course they can't play anything because
6691000	6693000	it requires a Kinect camera but
6693000	6695000	doesn't mean that they won't know
6695000	6697000	what songs are on there
6697000	6699000	and included in there
6699000	6701000	I'm not sure if these have been already announced
6701000	6703000	Lady Gaga's Poker Face
6703000	6705000	Lips Ink, Mouth to Mouth
6705000	6707000	M-I-A, Arlor
6707000	6709000	No Doubt, Rock Steady
6709000	6711000	Bell Biv Devoe, Poison
6711000	6713000	and BC Boy's Body Moving, the Fat Boy Slim remix
6713000	6715000	A few of those were already out there
6715000	6717000	but I don't remember the M-I-A song being announced
6717000	6719000	that's news to me
6719000	6721000	Interesting
6721000	6723000	Alright
6723000	6725000	Well we'll see if
6725000	6727000	what the song list looks like anyway
6727000	6729000	I'm sure not too much longer
6729000	6731000	we'll have the full song list announced
6731000	6733000	I'll probably give you about ten songs a week till it's all out there
6733000	6735000	Anyhow, how about Toy Story 3
6735000	6737000	Yeah it's not just a movie
6737000	6739000	it's a game as well
6739000	6741000	The game is out there, it's on the Wii I'm sure
6741000	6743000	It's also on the Xbox 360 and the Playstation 3
6743000	6745000	In fact the Playstation 3
6745000	6747000	is taking the opportunity of
6747000	6749000	having this unique hybrid premium
6749000	6751000	edition
6751000	6753000	So there is actually a new version out there
6753000	6755000	of Toy Story 3 bundled with
6755000	6757000	the original Toy Story movie
6757000	6759000	on a single Blu-ray disc
6759000	6761000	for 6499
6761000	6763000	So it's interesting
6763000	6765000	that it's not just like a combo
6765000	6767000	pack, but it's actually
6767000	6769000	both things were put onto one
6769000	6771000	disc for 65 bucks
6771000	6773000	Interesting
6773000	6775000	Yeah
6775000	6777000	But sadly
6777000	6779000	it's not both Toy Story and Toy Story 2
6779000	6781000	otherwise that would be a really killer deal
6781000	6783000	but what about Toy Story 2?
6783000	6785000	What about that?
6785000	6787000	What about it?
6787000	6789000	Dartatouille is correcting me saying it was Love at First Sight
6789000	6791000	that was in Max 2 US
6791000	6793000	Can't Get You Out of My Head, I was really close
6793000	6795000	That was in one of the US ones
6795000	6797000	I thought Can't Get You Out of My Head wasn't one of the US ones
6797000	6799000	Oh well, whatever
6799000	6801000	Anyhow, how about something non-music
6801000	6803000	game related, how about an MMO
6803000	6805000	but this is not the type of MMO you'd think
6805000	6807000	It is related to Disney though
6807000	6809000	Disney Pixar has a game called World
6809000	6811000	of Cars online
6811000	6813000	and of course you know in the Disney MMOs
6813000	6815000	you may have heard of this, you can't type in
6815000	6817000	your own stuff, you have to use the pre-selected
6817000	6819000	phrases and things that have been selected
6819000	6821000	for you, well one of the other things
6821000	6823000	you can do in the game is that you can pick your own car number
6823000	6825000	because of course you're playing race cars
6825000	6827000	so you can have whatever car number you want
6827000	6829000	except for 69
6829000	6831000	you cannot be car
6831000	6833000	69 in the car's MMO
6833000	6835000	Can you be car 420?
6835000	6837000	No, because the cars only have two digits
6837000	6839000	but you could be car 54 and you could be like
6839000	6841000	where are you?
6841000	6843000	old joke
6843000	6845000	I liked that show, it had the dude that played
6845000	6847000	Herman Munster
6847000	6849000	There you go, so yeah when you're selecting
6849000	6851000	apparently when you're in the game selecting the number for your car
6851000	6853000	if you go like, you select each
6853000	6855000	digit one at a time, so if you select
6855000	6857000	4, 5, 7, then you see
6857000	6859000	1 through 9 is the next digit, but when you
6859000	6861000	select 6, it only goes 0 through 8
6861000	6863000	so, interesting
6863000	6865000	World of Cars
6865000	6867000	online is free, worldofcars.go.com
6867000	6869000	you can sign up for free
6869000	6871000	but it is a
6871000	6873000	$5.95 a month subscription
6873000	6875000	if you want to get all the features
6875000	6877000	of World of Cars
6877000	6879000	that will not unlock car number 69
6879000	6881000	no just so you know, not even if you
6881000	6883000	pay for it
6883000	6885000	Dark Sakura
6885000	6887000	Well how about some
6887000	6889000	something different, something in the
6889000	6891000	Squeenix direction, remember we talked about
6891000	6893000	Gun Loco?
6893000	6895000	Well it turns out it's a game about
6895000	6897000	a planet full of criminals
6897000	6899000	they're all crazy
6899000	6901000	crazy crazy crazy criminals with guns
6901000	6903000	and the world's sort of like
6903000	6905000	an earthish ruin
6905000	6907000	type place and there's different
6907000	6909000	factions and they're always fighting
6909000	6911000	so
6911000	6913000	it looks
6913000	6915000	completely hilarious
6915000	6917000	I think I would really really
6917000	6919000	like to play it
6919000	6921000	all the characters were done by
6921000	6923000	Kenny Wong and basically made
6923000	6925000	toys of everything and then they scanned
6925000	6927000	them into the game so that's how the design
6927000	6929000	come about, so that's pretty cool
6929000	6931000	and then
6931000	6933000	for Rock Band we have the Disturbed
6933000	6935000	Pack
6935000	6937000	that's going to be on August
6937000	6939000	24th a couple days
6939000	6941000	from now, the Disturbed Pack has another
6941000	6943000	way to die, Asylum and the Animal
6943000	6945000	and then
6945000	6947000	there's Universal Motown Republic
6947000	6949000	Rock Pack which is Crash King's
6949000	6951000	Mountain Man, the Vir Union
6951000	6953000	Seasons and We Are the Fallen Bury
6953000	6955000	Me Alive
6955000	6957000	also
6957000	6959000	only one of those is available in
6959000	6961000	Lego Rock Band and that is the Vir Union
6961000	6963000	Seasons and lastly
6963000	6965000	the big Horkan grocery
6965000	6967000	store chain in England
6967000	6969000	called Tesco, you've
6969000	6971000	heard of them I'm sure
6971000	6973000	No, because they don't have them here
6973000	6975000	Actually, they do
6975000	6977000	There's a company called Fresh and Easy
6977000	6979000	that's a
6979000	6981000	Tesco chain in the United States
6981000	6983000	Still, I don't think I've ever
6983000	6985000	been to one, but okay
6985000	6987000	Let's just be opening a couple
6987000	6989000	in Sacramento
6989000	6991000	but anyway
6991000	6993000	it's like a big grocery store chain
6993000	6995000	anyway, they are now
6995000	6997000	going to be buying
6997000	6999000	used games
6999000	7001000	you will be paid in credit and then you
7001000	7003000	can buy whatever you need in the grocery store
7003000	7005000	so
7005000	7007000	basically they're saying
7007000	7009000	for Red Dead Redemption you'll get
7009000	7011000	a £19 trade in
7011000	7013000	Mario Kart for Wii gets £19
7013000	7015000	FIFA 2010 gets
7015000	7017000	£12, that type of thing
7017000	7019000	and then they're going to resell the
7019000	7021000	stores at other outlets
7021000	7023000	and already
7023000	7025000	about 60 Tesco stores
7025000	7027000	accept them
7027000	7029000	Everybody wants a piece of that industry
7029000	7031000	Now when someone says they have to pick
7031000	7033000	between video games and food, if money's
7033000	7035000	certain, they can literally
7035000	7037000	I had to give up
7037000	7039000	Red Dead Redemption, but I got some
7039000	7041000	Top Ramen, awesome
7041000	7043000	Alright, let's get into some Twitter
7043000	7045000	topics tonight. Every week you guys
7045000	7047000	submit us topics at www.
7047000	7049000	twitter.com slash o-l-r
7049000	7051000	and we pick a few of our
7051000	7053000	favorite topics and read through them here on the show
7053000	7055000	and sadly
7055000	7057000	I seem to be without my music tonight
7057000	7059000	What did I do?
7059000	7061000	I broke it all
7061000	7063000	Well, I guess Twitter topics cancelled because I don't have
7063000	7065000	theme songs. I blame Rob, I blame Rob
7065000	7067000	Live Radio
7067000	7069000	You just want to
7069000	7071000	sing the theme song tonight?
7071000	7073000	Oh, thank god we're all
7073000	7075000	saved, alright
7075000	7077000	Twitter.com slash o-l-r
7077000	7083000	Let's see who tweeted us this week here
7083000	7087000	Redtertainment sends us a tweet
7087000	7089000	says, o-l-r, is there a video game
7089000	7091000	equivalent of Rocky Horror?
7091000	7093000	You mean a game so bad
7093000	7095000	that it's kind of good?
7095000	7097000	Actually, I'll say this, there really was
7097000	7099000	There was a Rocky Horror show game
7099000	7101000	There was one of them back in the 80's
7101000	7103000	on the Apple 2e and the Commodore 64
7103000	7105000	I believe had a version
7105000	7107000	and you actually went around the castle
7107000	7109000	getting parts of Frank N Furter's laser
7109000	7111000	or something like that, you could play as Brad or Janet
7111000	7113000	I remember, and then they made a CD
7113000	7115000	That sounds rather Maniac Mansion
7115000	7117000	It was kind of inspired by that
7117000	7119000	There was a CD-ROM based one in the
7119000	7121000	mid 90's for one of the big
7121000	7123000	UK revivals and it actually
7123000	7125000	had like, back when full motion video was in
7125000	7127000	every CD-ROM game, they actually had a
7127000	7129000	Rocky Horror show game there, but it was released
7129000	7131000	I think exclusively in the UK, so I never played it
7131000	7133000	I don't know if people out there did
7133000	7135000	but that would be it
7135000	7137000	What about a game so bad it's kind of good?
7137000	7139000	How about not taking the question so literally
7139000	7141000	and a game so bad
7141000	7143000	it's kind of good?
7143000	7145000	Like, I think about Loki and how he talks about
7145000	7147000	Driver 3 all the time, that it's so terrible
7147000	7149000	that it's actually kind of fun
7149000	7151000	Earth Defense Force 2017
7151000	7153000	It's a very terrible game
7153000	7155000	but it's very fun
7155000	7157000	I think back in the day for me it was
7157000	7159000	Abadox
7159000	7161000	I don't know if I can think of one
7161000	7163000	that I really go, gosh that game
7163000	7165000	is so bad that I just love it for some reason
7165000	7167000	Anything come to your mind now?
7167000	7169000	Think of?
7169000	7171000	I'm not sure if I'm thinking of
7171000	7173000	terrible or just really difficult
7173000	7175000	but Battletoads?
7175000	7177000	I thought of one
7177000	7179000	I thought of one, a game that we actually played
7179000	7181000	on end because it was so awful
7181000	7183000	What's that?
7183000	7185000	Batman 3
7185000	7187000	It had the butt monkey in it
7187000	7189000	Seriously, it had this
7189000	7191000	like a baboon, so it had the big exposed
7191000	7193000	butt, and it would fly
7193000	7195000	its butt at people
7195000	7197000	and then there was this one guy who his
7197000	7199000	taunt was shooting people
7199000	7201000	He could just take damage off by
7201000	7203000	taunting, just shoot
7203000	7205000	bang, and it was so bad
7205000	7207000	and the voice acting was so horrible
7207000	7209000	and even to this day when
7209000	7211000	I'm hanging out with Mystique and we see a monkey
7211000	7213000	we'll go butt monkey dance
7213000	7215000	butt monkey dance
7215000	7217000	because he danced when he won
7217000	7219000	Tigerclaw
7219000	7221000	leave it to him to have the Google Foos
7221000	7223000	skills to find more information
7223000	7225000	The Rocky Interactive Horror
7225000	7227000	Show game was released in March
7227000	7229000	April 1999
7229000	7231000	it was later than I thought
7231000	7233000	for the PC by Online PLC
7233000	7235000	Similarly to the earlier CRL game
7235000	7237000	the player plays as Brad or Janet
7237000	7239000	and must rescue their partner from the castle
7239000	7241000	unlike the older computer game
7241000	7243000	its gameplay was more puzzle oriented
7243000	7245000	and benefited from the added detail, graphics
7245000	7247000	and live video sequences that the PC could provide
7247000	7249000	Was Frank-N-Furter in it though?
7249000	7251000	because if Frank-N-Furter
7251000	7253000	is not in it, I mean Tim Curry
7253000	7255000	single handedly makes
7255000	7257000	that movie, he does
7257000	7259000	The screams of
7259000	7261000	thousands of people when Frank-N-Furter
7261000	7263000	first shows up in the movie, tell me so
7263000	7265000	Alright, anyhow
7265000	7267000	Let's see, other tweets
7267000	7269000	that we have Twitter.com
7269000	7271000	Tigerclaw
7271000	7273000	sends us a link about an Italian city
7273000	7275000	that's pissed at Gran Turismo 5
7275000	7277000	Now why would you be angry at Gran Turismo 5?
7277000	7279000	Well apparently
7279000	7281000	Siena is a
7281000	7283000	city in Tuscany, Italy
7283000	7285000	They're very unhappy that
7285000	7287000	one of their, I guess
7287000	7289000	famous roads, the Piazza Del Campo
7289000	7291000	is actually a race course in
7291000	7293000	Gran Turismo 5's kart mode
7293000	7295000	They want it removed in the game
7295000	7297000	The road is
7297000	7299000	in the game or the structures or what have you
7299000	7301000	It's also
7301000	7303000	I'm just trying to
7303000	7305000	see what it is here
7305000	7307000	Sorry, when we get things from Twitter
7307000	7309000	we haven't had a chance to look at them in advance
7309000	7311000	or whatever
7311000	7313000	I guess because it's also partially
7313000	7315000	a horse race, oh I see
7315000	7317000	the Piazza Del Campo is also
7317000	7319000	the name of a famous horse racing track
7319000	7321000	So I guess they don't want people to kind of get
7321000	7323000	confused over what's going on there
7323000	7325000	So they've sent out a quote
7325000	7327000	diplomatic request to Sony
7327000	7329000	to resolve the matter
7329000	7331000	This game is coming out very soon though
7331000	7333000	so I don't know if it's going to be able to be fixed
7333000	7335000	unless they patch it out
7335000	7337000	because that's how they fix everything these days, right?
7339000	7341000	Let's see
7341000	7343000	I'll read this one too from Tiger Claw
7343000	7345000	We give everybody at least two tweets
7345000	7347000	So Tiger Claw says it's this tweet
7347000	7349000	Disney Online hits a traffic high
7349000	7351000	with 36 million monthly
7351000	7353000	visitors, wow
7353000	7355000	How much are on Facebook?
7355000	7357000	How much of that's on Facebook? They don't really get their
7357000	7359000	users through Facebook, do they?
7359000	7361000	But they do Club Penguin
7361000	7363000	You've seen those Club Penguin cards at Target
7363000	7365000	and all those other stores. That's probably their biggest game there
7365000	7367000	They also have Toontown Online
7367000	7369000	Disney Fairies Pixie Hollow
7369000	7371000	I didn't even know there was a Disney Fairies Pixie Hollow
7371000	7373000	There you go
7373000	7375000	So lots and lots of games that Disney has
7375000	7377000	They've hit quite a milestone there
7377000	7379000	Never played one of them
7379000	7381000	I love Penguins too
7381000	7383000	I don't know why I've never played Club Penguin
7383000	7385000	but I just haven't
7385000	7387000	DJ Blazekin sends us a variety of stories
7387000	7389000	Some of them we're going to be talking about earlier or later
7389000	7391000	But this one I don't think goes on our showroll
7391000	7393000	This has to do with other Blizzard stuff
7393000	7395000	Big things planned for Diablo 3
7395000	7397000	at this year's BlizzCon
7397000	7399000	Apparently there is big Diablo 3 news coming out
7399000	7401000	at BlizzCon this year
7401000	7403000	It's going to be split into three games
7403000	7405000	No, let's hope not
7405000	7407000	I guess this is coming out of
7407000	7409000	Gamescom. It's the games director
7409000	7411000	Jay Wilson saying
7411000	7413000	I can say that this BlizzCon
7413000	7415000	in terms of Diablo news
7415000	7417000	will be the biggest one that we've ever had
7417000	7419000	Well it's probably because that's the game they're going to focus most on
7419000	7421000	because by that point we ought to know the release date
7421000	7423000	for Cataclysm
7423000	7425000	and it'll be out either just before or just after
7425000	7427000	Did they even have BlizzCon back in
7427000	7429000	Diablo 2 days?
7429000	7431000	No, they didn't
7431000	7433000	Of course it's going to be the one they've had the most time
7433000	7435000	I don't know what the hell that means
7435000	7437000	They're going to reveal another playable class in the game
7437000	7439000	They say there's only going to be one more
7439000	7441000	a fifth class and they've announced all the others
7441000	7443000	Cheerleader
7443000	7445000	Let's hope. Maybe they'll release a peripheral
7445000	7447000	for the keyboard like they had on
7447000	7449000	We Cheer. That'd be great
7449000	7451000	We'll see what happens
7451000	7455000	You know what's really interesting though about that is that
7455000	7457000	with Starcraft 2 having had
7457000	7459000	the digital distribution day one
7459000	7461000	but Diablo 3 is going to have that too
7461000	7463000	so I wonder if it's really going to have that big
7463000	7465000	midnight launch or what have you
7465000	7467000	I don't know
7467000	7469000	Let's see. Anyhow
7469000	7471000	Oh dear
7471000	7473000	We're getting linked to this by ActDeft
7473000	7475000	and I just see Furries in the title
7475000	7477000	so I'm worried about this
7477000	7479000	He links this to a story from Kotaku that says
7479000	7481000	Microsoft Connect supports Furries
7481000	7483000	and it's got a video on it
7483000	7485000	Do I want to see this?
7485000	7487000	We know what you're thinking
7487000	7489000	Will Microsoft Connect read your body
7489000	7491000	when fully encased in a fur suit?
7491000	7495000	And again this is coming from Kotaku I guess
7495000	7499000	Yes and sure enough somebody is dancing there
7499000	7501000	in a full kitty costume there
7501000	7503000	to Dance Central
7503000	7505000	Thank you ActDeft
7505000	7507000	for wasting 30 seconds of my life
7507000	7509000	I will never be able to get back
7509000	7511000	So at Dragon Con over Labor Day weekend
7511000	7513000	they can yiff
7513000	7515000	in the privacy of their hotel rooms
7515000	7517000	or they can get their gaga on
7517000	7519000	Bobby's going to Dragon Con
7519000	7521000	I hope he's still listening
7521000	7523000	Bobby I would really like to request
7523000	7525000	a full furry report
7525000	7527000	on the furry scene
7527000	7529000	at Dragon Con
7529000	7531000	Bring some Purell
7531000	7533000	I'd say bring the candle
7533000	7535000	I saw
7535000	7537000	DarkKusuke sends us a tweet on Twitter
7537000	7539000	saying that Star Wars Clone Wars
7539000	7541000	Open Beta opened today
7541000	7543000	Really I did not know that
7543000	7545000	A lot of these big games
7545000	7547000	coming out the Christmas season
7547000	7549000	I guess are having their betas open up
7549000	7551000	When's the DC Universe one open up?
7551000	7553000	That's the one I really want to play
7553000	7555000	Really bad
7555000	7557000	And lastly Alex P. Carson tweets us
7557000	7559000	saying does anybody know the official name
7559000	7561000	of the Super Mario version of M.I.A.
7561000	7563000	Paper Planes that was on the Afterbirth
7563000	7565000	a while back
7565000	7567000	That's making me think
7567000	7569000	There's a website that has tons of chiptunes
7569000	7571000	and I can't think of the name of it right now
7571000	7573000	but hopefully somebody in chat will remember
7573000	7575000	and we found it on there
7575000	7577000	and I bet if you search for Paper Planes
7577000	7579000	you could find it
7579000	7581000	There's some huge chiptunes website
7581000	7583000	and I can't remember the name of it
7583000	7585000	like it totally escapes me right now
7585000	7587000	Somebody in chat will remember what it is
7587000	7589000	It's like it's just a bunch of homegrown stuff
7589000	7591000	and if you like that you'll probably like a lot of the stuff that's on there
7591000	7593000	So hopefully somebody in chat will shout it out here soon
7593000	7595000	If not I'll Google it in a minute
7595000	7597000	I'll find it
7597000	7599000	Let me Google that for you
7599000	7601000	Alright that's gonna do it for Twitter Topics tonight
7601000	7603000	Don't miss tweets in the future
7603000	7605000	Twitter.com slash O-L-R
7605000	7607000	In the meantime while I try to figure out
7607000	7609000	what song that was
7609000	7611000	Loki
7611000	7613000	This week both the Guitar Hero
7613000	7615000	Warriors of Rock tracklist
7615000	7617000	and Rock Band
7617000	7619000	3 tracklists
7619000	7621000	were revealed
7621000	7623000	and it's interesting
7623000	7625000	because there's definitely a lot of stuff to go over
7625000	7627000	So let's start off
7627000	7629000	with Guitar Hero
7629000	7631000	Warriors of Rock
7631000	7633000	There's gonna be 93 tracks
7633000	7635000	I'm not gonna go through all of these
7635000	7637000	But some of the ones I thought were interesting
7637000	7639000	Rush 2112
7639000	7641000	They have all 7 parts of it
7641000	7643000	That's kind of neat I guess
7643000	7645000	Let's see
7645000	7647000	What are some of the ones that stood out to me
7647000	7649000	Rammstein
7649000	7651000	They've got a song from them
7651000	7653000	Looks like
7653000	7655000	Wade Mann's Hyle
7655000	7657000	Let's see here
7657000	7659000	REM Losing My Religion
7659000	7661000	Queen Bohemian Rhapsody
7661000	7663000	Of course both games have that
7663000	7665000	awesome song
7665000	7667000	By the way there was a Queen
7667000	7669000	slot machine that I played in Reno
7669000	7671000	and it's the most amazing
7671000	7673000	gambling device I've ever played
7673000	7675000	The bonus
7675000	7677000	round it lets me pick a Queen song and then
7677000	7679000	the game plays itself for free for like
7679000	7681000	a minute while I sit there and listen to Radio Gaga
7681000	7683000	It's amazing
7683000	7685000	That's cool
7685000	7687000	Um
7687000	7689000	Let's see what other songs on here
7689000	7691000	Um
7691000	7693000	They've got like actually a bunch of
7693000	7695000	Just a bunch of everything
7695000	7697000	About one song from each artist on here
7697000	7699000	Some of the ones I actually recognize
7699000	7701000	Let's see of course they have
7701000	7703000	Deep Purple, Burn
7703000	7705000	The
7705000	7707000	Queen's Clearwater Revival
7707000	7709000	Fortunate Son
7709000	7711000	Download content from
7711000	7713000	Rock Band 2
7713000	7715000	Foreigner feels like the first time
7717000	7719000	Um
7719000	7721000	By the way did you see
7721000	7723000	that video where they
7723000	7725000	fessed up that the Rock Band 3 leak was real
7725000	7727000	basically? Yeah they have the
7727000	7729000	Rock Band full track list behind
7729000	7731000	them. Yeah that was funny
7731000	7733000	Um anyway so yeah
7733000	7735000	lots of stuff, ballista's out there
7735000	7737000	Um
7737000	7739000	Looks pretty cool
7739000	7741000	And of course Rock Band 3
7741000	7743000	Uh we've got
7743000	7745000	Let's see here
7745000	7747000	Lots of things from there
7747000	7749000	Um their track list is
7749000	7751000	a little bit smaller but of course you get all the download content
7751000	7753000	from Rock Band 2 and
7753000	7755000	all the tracks from that and anything else
7755000	7757000	you pretty much have bought
7757000	7759000	So starting off with that
7759000	7761000	They have Amy Winehouse in
7761000	7763000	Rehab but I didn't really think of that as a rock
7763000	7765000	song but okay
7765000	7767000	Um
7767000	7769000	They of course uh let's see here
7769000	7771000	Devo, Whip It
7771000	7773000	They have Imagine by John Lennon though
7773000	7775000	Which I don't think of as a rock song
7775000	7777000	But I think that's a sweet
7777000	7779000	addition to the game. Hell yeah
7779000	7781000	Um one of course I was excited about
7781000	7783000	when they first announced it
7783000	7785000	Huey Lewis and the News, The Power of Love
7785000	7787000	Just need back time now
7787000	7789000	Perfect
7789000	7791000	I heard that song a ton at E3, that was in the E3 build
7791000	7793000	Um
7793000	7795000	Leonard Skynyrd Freebird
7795000	7797000	Of course on there
7797000	7799000	Marilyn Manson, The Beautiful People
7799000	7801000	Ozzy Osbourne,
7801000	7803000	Crazy Train
7803000	7805000	I know they had another Rammstein song on here
7805000	7807000	Duhost
7807000	7809000	Which is pretty cool. Not pussy
7809000	7811000	Is it in German?
7811000	7813000	If it is in German that would be great
7813000	7815000	I have to sort of digress
7815000	7817000	Why not? That's what we do here on this show
7817000	7819000	One of the E3 trips, all the DDR Freak
7819000	7821000	moderators got together and went to the Korean
7821000	7823000	karaoke place and Duhost was on there
7823000	7825000	and we were all
7825000	7827000	singing Duhost in our worst Rammstein
7827000	7829000	German voices
7829000	7831000	Duhost mich!
7831000	7833000	Oh that is great
7833000	7835000	Um you know Police Don't Stand So Close
7835000	7837000	to Me
7837000	7839000	They also had
7839000	7841000	I hate this song
7841000	7843000	Smash Mouth Walkin' on the Sun
7843000	7845000	The Sounds Livin' in America
7845000	7847000	At least it's not that
7847000	7849000	Hey now, you're an all-star
7849000	7851000	It's Avon, get paid
7851000	7853000	I think that was in Lego Rock Band
7853000	7855000	I hate that song
7855000	7857000	Um
7857000	7859000	Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers
7859000	7861000	I need to know
7861000	7863000	Curse of Fears, Everybody Wants to Rule the World
7863000	7865000	Lots of cool stuff
7865000	7867000	I'm just looking forward to actually being able to play
7867000	7869000	a lot of these songs with the keyboard
7869000	7871000	Which would be really sweet
7871000	7873000	I really hope they go back and add keyboard support
7873000	7875000	for some of the old classic download songs
7875000	7877000	Yeah I don't know if they're gonna but
7877000	7879000	They need to
7879000	7881000	They really need to
7881000	7883000	Just sayin'
7883000	7885000	Oh of course they have Deep Purple, Smoke on the Water
7885000	7887000	Probably the better at Deep Purple song if you ask me
7887000	7889000	Alright
7889000	7891000	By the way, just to answer that tweet from a few minutes ago
7891000	7893000	Finally found the answer there
7893000	7895000	We're using my Google FU
7895000	7897000	The listener's in chatroom and found it already
7897000	7899000	But just for anybody else who's listening
7899000	7901000	The artist's name is CSLSX
7901000	7903000	And the website I was trying to think of
7903000	7905000	8Bit Collective
7905000	7907000	Which is actually a really good website for a bunch of chiptunes
7907000	7909000	The number 8, not spelled out
7909000	7911000	Actually the number 8, bc.org
7911000	7913000	And you can get all these NES chiptunes
7923000	7925000	Actually that was like the worst possible clip
7925000	7927000	of the song I could play for you guys
7927000	7929000	But it's not bad, go check it out
7931000	7933000	More news for you guys
7933000	7935000	This is about a new peripheral
7935000	7937000	Which I find kind of interesting
7937000	7939000	You don't see a whole lot of these
7939000	7941000	3rd party peripherals, or at least you're not used to
7941000	7943000	You start seeing more now, like you know
7943000	7945000	DDR mats, and rock band guitars
7945000	7947000	And so forth, this is something a little new
7947000	7949000	THQ is putting out a new game tablet
7949000	7951000	For the Wii, it's like a drawing
7951000	7953000	Tablet that you
7953000	7955000	It's actually kind of like a combination, you put the Wii mode in there
7955000	7957000	And then you have actually this little tablet
7957000	7959000	It's called UDraw
7959000	7961000	It's a 4x6 inch tablet
7961000	7963000	And it's going to be coming out for the Wii
7963000	7965000	And it will be coming out for $70
7965000	7967000	And it comes with UDraw Studio
7967000	7969000	It's a drawing, coloring, and art based
7969000	7971000	video game, which I think is kind of cool
7971000	7973000	Mario Paint! It's Mario Paint basically
7973000	7975000	And how long have we been saying they need to do
7975000	7977000	Mario Paint on the Wii, so
7977000	7979000	THQ is kind of doing it the way it ought to be done
7979000	7981000	And what I love too is that one of the promotional
7981000	7983000	shots here for the game
7983000	7985000	Is somebody who has drawn
7985000	7987000	Wait for it, I'm trying to bring it up here in the studio
7987000	7989000	They've actually drawn on the screen, oh damn
7989000	7991000	It's a unicorn, somebody drew a unicorn
7991000	7993000	But unicorn works too
7993000	7995000	I'm wondering if there would be some way
7995000	7997000	They're going to make an adapter to use it on the PC or something
7997000	7999000	Because it's definitely
7999000	8001000	cheaper than buying a Bluetooth
8001000	8003000	Adapter
8003000	8005000	In the end though, I mean
8005000	8007000	I paid $400 for my tablet
8007000	8009000	And
8009000	8011000	I can use Photoshop
8011000	8013000	But Jamie, can you draw that
8013000	8015000	bitchin' unicorn? I could draw that unicorn
8015000	8017000	right now
8017000	8019000	It just got a hit on Apple a little bit
8019000	8021000	But the fact that the Wii has a proper
8021000	8023000	tablet means that it's more of an iPad than the
8023000	8025000	iPad is
8025000	8027000	There you go
8027000	8029000	Look, I'm drawing a unicorn right now
8029000	8031000	Yay
8031000	8033000	Actually, you know what, we've been
8033000	8035000	needing new album art for Orange Lounge Radio
8035000	8037000	And I'm still waiting on those pictures
8037000	8039000	Well I think it should be, you took one of me like
8039000	8041000	years ago, anyway
8041000	8043000	No, I think we should just have a giant unicorn
8043000	8045000	In the album art
8045000	8047000	Speaking of unicorns, and I know I'm a little bit
8047000	8049000	behind in times because I used to check
8049000	8051000	their YouTube feed every now and then
8051000	8053000	They have a new Charlie
8053000	8055000	the Unicorn, except it's not Charlie the Unicorn
8055000	8057000	It's Charlie
8057000	8059000	Teh-Unicron
8059000	8061000	And it's like these remixed versions of
8061000	8063000	the Charlie the Unicorn episodes
8063000	8065000	And it was hilarious because they burned
8065000	8067000	down the forest
8067000	8069000	Candy Mountain
8069000	8071000	Alright, anyway
8071000	8073000	Some other games that are coming out
8073000	8075000	That's not the only game coming out as the Mario
8075000	8077000	Paint-ish clone
8077000	8079000	U-Draw will also be getting launch games
8079000	8081000	Pictionary, because you know, you gotta have more
8081000	8083000	of the board games on the Wii
8083000	8085000	And Dude's Big Adventure, that's D-O-O-D
8085000	8087000	Like, doodle
8087000	8089000	He, dude
8089000	8091000	Dude's Big Adventure, it's a world where coloring
8091000	8093000	books come to life
8093000	8095000	Apparently it's heavily inspired by the game
8095000	8097000	Drawn to Life, which was also a THQ game
8097000	8099000	So they're just kinda like, you know, getting themselves there
8099000	8101000	I'm sure the next
8101000	8103000	Drawn to Life game will support this as well
8103000	8105000	We'll see
8105000	8107000	There's your damn unicorn
8107000	8109000	I can't hold the pen very well
8109000	8111000	I can't hold my stylus very well to control my
8111000	8113000	Can you put a picture of that up on orangeontradar.com?
8113000	8115000	Alright, awesome
8115000	8117000	Okay
8117000	8119000	Awesome
8119000	8121000	So yeah, U-Draw, I don't know, is anyone in here
8121000	8123000	interested in U-Draw? I guess Dark Soccer made
8123000	8125000	a pretty good case for it, if it would work on the PC
8125000	8127000	Nope
8127000	8129000	Yeah, I'm not really interested either, but I do want an iPad
8129000	8131000	Nope
8131000	8133000	I think a lot of
8133000	8135000	dinner parties have ended in divorce
8135000	8137000	due to bad rounds of Pictionary
8137000	8139000	And I'm glad that that experience can come
8139000	8141000	now, come to the Wii
8141000	8143000	To a whole new generation
8143000	8145000	Dark Soccer, I hate to tear you away from
8145000	8147000	unicorn drawing, but there is more gaming news
8147000	8149000	to be talked about tonight, correct?
8149000	8151000	The Doctor
8151000	8153000	Doctor Who, there's going to be a third
8153000	8155000	game
8155000	8157000	Oh, well, a third episode
8157000	8159000	of Doctor Who, the adventure games
8159000	8161000	This one's called TARDIS
8161000	8163000	And you get to fly the TARDIS
8163000	8165000	It'll be out on the
8165000	8167000	27th of August, and
8167000	8169000	the whole thing is that you have to
8169000	8171000	explore the entire TARDIS
8171000	8173000	And the TARDIS is freaking big
8173000	8175000	Remember, it's bigger on the inside
8175000	8177000	And
8177000	8179000	then you can fly the TARDIS
8179000	8181000	So, that's pretty cool
8181000	8183000	You know, it's basically
8183000	8185000	overcoming 40 years
8185000	8187000	of what's it like to pilot the TARDIS
8187000	8189000	in one game
8189000	8191000	Although, really, the TARDIS
8191000	8193000	is meant to be piloted by six people
8193000	8195000	It should be a bullet hell game featuring the TARDIS
8195000	8197000	The TARDIS can't shoot anything
8197000	8199000	That sounds retard-ous
8199000	8201000	Anyway, this one's featuring
8201000	8203000	the 11th Doctor
8203000	8205000	being Matt Smith
8205000	8207000	and Amy Pond
8207000	8209000	played by Karen Gillan
8209000	8211000	So, pretty cool
8211000	8213000	And it's free!
8213000	8215000	For all you people in the UK
8215000	8217000	Oh yeah, don't we have to pay for it though?
8217000	8219000	Because the Brits get it subsidized with their television tax
8219000	8221000	or whatever, but we have to actually pay for it
8221000	8223000	Yeah, we don't have TV tax
8223000	8225000	Lame
8225000	8227000	I mean, great that we don't have TV tax
8227000	8229000	Although, Comcast kind of, you know, sends me a
8229000	8231000	TV tax bill every month, but I guess that's a whole
8231000	8233000	other issue
8233000	8235000	You know I am going to be ditching cable TV though
8235000	8237000	Well, with an HD receiver
8237000	8239000	Like, I can just go get a good HD
8239000	8241000	antenna for 50 bucks and I can get my basic
8241000	8243000	channels, which is all I watch on cable
8243000	8245000	So, why am I bothering?
8245000	8247000	Although, I will say cable internet is where it's at
8247000	8249000	My internet with them
8249000	8251000	has actually gotten way faster recently
8251000	8253000	Now I'm getting, you know, about
8253000	8255000	I don't know what it ends up being
8255000	8257000	with megabits, but I'm getting about
8257000	8259000	one and a half megabytes
8259000	8261000	per second down
8261000	8263000	I forgot the sparkles
8263000	8265000	Thanks for downloading things really fast
8265000	8267000	Plus, we got some more HD channels, so I've been watching
8267000	8269000	Man vs. Food and
8269000	8271000	Lots of Ninja Warrior
8271000	8273000	I did notice a shit ton of new HD channels
8273000	8275000	I watched six hours of
8275000	8277000	Ninja Warrior straight one of these days
8277000	8279000	because I had to wake up with
8279000	8281000	Joshua, and he didn't want to go to sleep
8281000	8283000	and I couldn't change channel
8283000	8285000	But he didn't want to watch Ninja Warrior
8285000	8287000	I watched Ninja Warrior, I watched like three seasons of it
8287000	8289000	I like that you're teaching him young
8289000	8291000	Ninjas are awesome
8291000	8293000	Will you be an equal opportunity household where
8293000	8295000	pirates are also?
8295000	8297000	If they have a cool pirate game show, then yes
8297000	8299000	We'll watch the pirate game show, but
8299000	8301000	Right now it's just Ninja Warrior where it's at
8301000	8303000	And then of course G4, you know, they have to do
8303000	8305000	the American Ninja Warrior
8305000	8307000	And that just, that is about
8307000	8309000	as bad as the stupid American Iron
8309000	8311000	Chef, and you know, I hated it
8311000	8313000	a lot when it first
8313000	8315000	came out over here, but
8315000	8317000	now not so much
8317000	8319000	Just because I don't think I have the Japanese one
8319000	8321000	to compare it to anymore
8321000	8323000	Plus, Julie Chen
8323000	8325000	is a judge a lot on Iron Chef America
8325000	8327000	And I love Julie Chen, just saying
8329000	8331000	Wait, what are we talking about now?
8331000	8333000	You're ditching cable
8333000	8335000	The Doctor Who game, that was it
8335000	8337000	We got to the end of it, so it's all you, Logie
8337000	8339000	I'm sorry, it was
8339000	8341000	all these different tangents and I forgot which one
8341000	8343000	I see you shopping on eBay over there, it's all good
8343000	8345000	Yeah, I know
8345000	8347000	I don't even know what I'm looking for, I'm just looking
8347000	8349000	Because that's what I do
8349000	8351000	One of the things that's kind of funny
8351000	8353000	We were talking a little bit about different systems
8353000	8355000	being hacked, well, something else
8355000	8357000	that Microsoft had hoped wouldn't have been
8357000	8359000	hacked, but it was, was the brand
8359000	8361000	new Xbox 360
8361000	8363000	system, the S slim, whatever
8363000	8365000	the hell you want to call it, apparently
8365000	8367000	the
8367000	8369000	I guess, mod chip creation
8369000	8371000	group
8371000	8373000	Team Executor has been working
8373000	8375000	closely with Team Jungle, who has created
8375000	8377000	you know, drive firmwares
8377000	8379000	for the original
8379000	8381000	Xbox 360 systems, and
8381000	8383000	Commodore Forever, also
8383000	8385000	responsible for
8385000	8387000	firmwares for those systems and hacking
8387000	8389000	DVD drives, and now
8389000	8391000	they have figured out a way
8391000	8393000	to be able to patch
8393000	8395000	the DVD rom on those new
8395000	8397000	slim systems to
8397000	8399000	play backups, so yes
8399000	8401000	they have now created a new hacked
8401000	8403000	firmware for that
8403000	8405000	So
8405000	8407000	They just keep
8407000	8409000	trying, but they find ways around it
8409000	8411000	But again, if you
8411000	8413000	go online with it, bananated
8413000	8415000	right? Um
8415000	8417000	I'm not sure, because
8417000	8419000	I would assume, yes, eventually you'll
8419000	8421000	probably get banned, but
8421000	8423000	the newer firmwares nowadays, they have
8423000	8425000	light touch and stuff like that
8425000	8427000	are apparently really
8427000	8429000	stealthy, like it's very hard to detect
8429000	8431000	them, so
8431000	8433000	maybe? I don't know, I would assume
8433000	8435000	eventually, yes, but then again
8435000	8437000	I have a system at my work
8437000	8439000	that was supposed to be modded
8439000	8441000	and it hasn't been banned at all, then again
8441000	8443000	we've not played one burned game on it, we just
8443000	8445000	actually, it's funny, I bought it
8445000	8447000	to replace another modded system, that's
8447000	8449000	when we decided, hey, you know what, let's just play some
8449000	8451000	normal Grand Theft Auto games instead of the modded ones
8451000	8453000	Um, we will be playing the modded ones
8453000	8455000	again, but we're not modifying our drive
8455000	8457000	firmware, we're just doing disk swaps, so that
8457000	8459000	even if they did detect, you know, that
8459000	8461000	we were playing a modded game, when they look at the system
8461000	8463000	the drive's not modded, so
8463000	8465000	They can't ban me!
8465000	8467000	Well, they can, but
8467000	8469000	I would have
8469000	8471000	a fighting chance
8473000	8475000	Alright, you don't, you haven't
8475000	8477000	had to play, you haven't had the opportunity to play
8477000	8479000	around with one of the new 360 models, right?
8479000	8481000	I don't really care, I mean
8481000	8483000	it's neat that they changed, you know, the way
8483000	8485000	it looks, and I like how it makes little noises and
8485000	8487000	stuff when you click on the buttons
8487000	8489000	Um, and apparently there's some like
8489000	8491000	way, I, or, I remember
8491000	8493000	now they're gonna have the new sim system
8493000	8495000	with the Halo stuff
8495000	8497000	and it's gonna have some different sound effects for that
8497000	8499000	that's kinda neat, but
8499000	8501000	yeah, I mean, I don't know
8501000	8503000	I wouldn't need one of these
8503000	8505000	but, I don't know
8505000	8507000	if someone gives one to me, I'm not gonna turn down
8507000	8509000	Alright, well
8509000	8511000	do you like to cut in line at big
8511000	8513000	trade shows, or
8513000	8515000	I guess not necessarily a trade show, but big conventions
8515000	8517000	and uh, you know, have everybody hate you?
8517000	8519000	Uh, well here you have your
8519000	8521000	opportunity if you are a member of the gun club
8521000	8523000	it's uh, Electronic Arts
8523000	8525000	one of their uh, little promotional clubs
8525000	8527000	they actually are running a promotion right now
8527000	8529000	where you got an email
8529000	8531000	and if you want, you can skip the line
8531000	8533000	to see Dead Space 2 at Penny Arcade
8533000	8535000	Expo, if you have a copy of the email
8535000	8537000	that's right, you can skip the line with a printout
8537000	8539000	of the email, and uh, Penny Arcade
8539000	8541000	Expo's coming up in a couple weeks, that same
8541000	8543000	Labor Day weekend that we're thinking of doing a long show
8543000	8545000	and uh, there you go, you print out the email
8545000	8547000	now why hasn't somebody just put the email online
8547000	8549000	and then you just mass
8549000	8551000	print it and then go, maybe there's like a barcode
8551000	8553000	on it or something we're not seeing, I don't know
8553000	8555000	probably, no, I don't think that's the case
8555000	8557000	I think it's just people don't want to do that
8557000	8559000	so that, you know, the line for that is
8559000	8561000	really long, why would they, well
8561000	8563000	it's gonna have the same line anyway, you know
8563000	8565000	it's, exactly, and you know
8565000	8567000	what, and it, it does suck, but then
8567000	8569000	again, it's their booth space that they're, they
8569000	8571000	paid for, they can do whatever the hell they want
8571000	8573000	it's a strange precedent to be setting
8573000	8575000	I mean, I, the only weird
8575000	8577000	oddity about it for me is that, you know, and I
8577000	8579000	made a big mistake calling it a trade show earlier
8579000	8581000	because it's not, but PAX is more of a
8581000	8583000	convention, and I always thought one of the things
8583000	8585000	that was supposed to kind of separate it is that
8585000	8587000	everybody was on equal footing, like media
8587000	8589000	doesn't get special treatment there, you're not
8589000	8591000	supposed to be doing all these like media appointments
8591000	8593000	and things, like that's what E3 is for, even though
8593000	8595000	especially the years that E3
8595000	8597000	went to
8597000	8599000	the airport
8599000	8601000	in Santa Monica or wherever it was, PAX
8601000	8603000	kind of started to get a little more of that
8603000	8605000	uh, where, you know, you could get in early if you
8605000	8607000	were media and so forth, but I always thought PAX was supposed to be
8607000	8609000	this place where everybody's on equal ground
8609000	8611000	so, then, why
8611000	8613000	is it now that some people are
8613000	8615000	special, but of course, you know, again, it's
8615000	8617000	this company, their email list, they're just
8617000	8619000	trying to pimp the service, the gun club
8619000	8621000	they're trying to pimp it to make it have some values
8621000	8623000	so that people can sign up for it
8623000	8625000	I don't remember if it costs anything, I think it's just
8625000	8627000	I know you, like, for example, if you buy that
8627000	8629000	Battlefield Ultimate, uh, you know, Battlefield
8629000	8631000	Bad Company 2 Ultimate Edition or whatever
8631000	8633000	you get membership into the gun club
8633000	8635000	I don't remember if it costs anything
8635000	8637000	initially to sign up or whatever
8637000	8639000	but you get, like, you know, into the Medal of Honor
8639000	8641000	beta, um, early
8641000	8643000	and stuff like that, so it's little
8643000	8645000	tidbits of that kind of thing that are supposed to
8645000	8647000	I guess they're making it worthwhile
8647000	8649000	but, um
8649000	8651000	I don't know, like I said, they're a booth, they can
8651000	8653000	do whatever the hell they want
8653000	8655000	Toagak in our chatroom at chat.orangelandre.com
8655000	8657000	says, I like the whole, we don't care if you are
8657000	8659000	media stuff, believe it or not, me too
8659000	8661000	I, and I wish they did the same thing at E3
8661000	8663000	I know that sounds weird, cause, like, you know
8663000	8665000	I, I, you know, can get media
8665000	8667000	credentials for E3, but I just, I kinda
8667000	8669000	like it when everybody's in the same footy, but E3
8669000	8671000	you can't see E3 anymore without
8671000	8673000	Here's the thing with E3, planning it out six months
8673000	8675000	in advance, even if you do get media credentials
8675000	8677000	it still doesn't matter, because
8677000	8679000	they basically look at you
8679000	8681000	they're like, oh, well you're not IGN
8681000	8683000	or, you know, 1up
8683000	8685000	or whatever, so, well we don't
8685000	8687000	know who you are, so we don't care
8687000	8689000	you know, so it doesn't matter, you can get
8689000	8691000	it's because a lot of the marketing people
8691000	8693000	behind video games, don't play
8693000	8695000	video games, and know nothing about video games
8695000	8697000	there's so many of them out there
8697000	8699000	that just don't
8699000	8701000	they don't even know the product that they're
8701000	8703000	selling Oh yeah, I know that, I deal with a lot of
8703000	8705000	corporate sales reps from these
8705000	8707000	companies that are talking about the games coming on
8707000	8709000	and I start asking a question about stuff and they're like
8709000	8711000	I don't know, I don't play games, it's like
8711000	8713000	you know, you don't even know your own product?
8713000	8715000	I mean, come on
8715000	8717000	It's pretty astounding
8717000	8719000	kind of sad though
8719000	8721000	but
8721000	8723000	we just have to support those companies that
8723000	8725000	you know, know what they're doing
8725000	8727000	just like Konami, they don't like to
8727000	8729000	invite us anymore to things, but I understand
8729000	8731000	they're not in San Francisco anymore, but
8731000	8733000	so what, you know, you can at least send the damn
8733000	8735000	invite, and if we can't make it, that's not a big deal
8735000	8737000	well, the DDR thing was public, and I thought
8737000	8739000	that was great
8739000	8741000	yeah, that was a great way to do it
8741000	8743000	exactly, let all the people who really want to see it, go see it
8743000	8745000	alright, anyhow, let's
8745000	8747000	open up the mailbag
8747000	8749000	yay, every week you guys send us emails
8749000	8751000	here at mailbag at orangelandrado.com
8751000	8753000	we select a few of our favorites
8753000	8755000	and read them here on air
8755000	8757000	mailbag at orangelandrado.com
8757000	8759000	looks like our mailbag is very full from that mail we got
8759000	8761000	I'm not reading all of them
8761000	8763000	so don't be
8763000	8765000	butthurt if you don't get your email read
8765000	8767000	basically if it was one asking us to advertise
8767000	8769000	usernames, or asking us about
8769000	8771000	advertising, or asking us
8771000	8773000	about those types of things, we'll be replying
8773000	8775000	to you offline
8775000	8777000	um, first one up
8777000	8779000	um, hello O.L.R.
8779000	8781000	Haseo Sumi
8781000	8783000	uh, I can't say anything
8783000	8785000	Haseo Sumi Ragawa
8785000	8787000	um, hey, or Pliskin, as it was
8787000	8789000	in my last email, yes, it's a Metal Gear Solid reference
8789000	8791000	um, if Rob still
8791000	8793000	hates Justin Bieber, have him watch this, whatever
8793000	8795000	um, sorry, it's a
8795000	8797000	a video that I haven't pulled up
8797000	8799000	oh, everybody saw, it's probably him
8799000	8801000	getting hit with a water bottle
8801000	8803000	I saw the Keyboard Cat
8803000	8805000	version of that
8805000	8807000	and Dark Sakura, if you still love Doctor Who
8807000	8809000	I have a video for you, and I pulled it up and I'll watch it later
8809000	8811000	it's the Mighty Morphin' Dalek Rangers
8811000	8813000	and on to non-Bieber
8813000	8815000	stuff, um, okay, I tried to
8815000	8817000	download a shady copy of Bleach Heat
8817000	8819000	the Soul 6 for a Japanese game site
8819000	8821000	but for some reason it keeps saying
8821000	8823000	corrupted or unsupported data, any suggestions?
8823000	8825000	punctuation?
8825000	8827000	um, no, I'm kidding, um
8827000	8829000	I would say, um
8829000	8831000	check your region
8831000	8833000	what?
8833000	8835000	what was the question?
8835000	8837000	it downloaded a copy of Bleach Heat
8837000	8839000	the Soul 6 from a
8839000	8841000	Japanese game site
8841000	8843000	but it says corrupted or unsupported
8843000	8845000	data is that through an emulator
8845000	8847000	or through a console? it didn't say
8847000	8849000	he downloaded it?
8849000	8851000	give us more details, dude you get what you pay
8851000	8853000	for, I mean
8853000	8855000	re-download it
8855000	8857000	I don't know, if it's a PC game
8857000	8859000	then it sounds like it's just a corrupted download
8859000	8861000	and you have to re-download it
8861000	8863000	if you're downloading a pirated version of a game
8863000	8865000	of some sort, um
8865000	8867000	perhaps you need to burn it at a lower
8867000	8869000	lower speed
8869000	8871000	if you're pirating a current game
8871000	8873000	I don't think we can really help you
8873000	8875000	I mean, you're not supposed to be doing that, naughty naughty
8875000	8877000	if this is a game I don't recognize
8877000	8879000	from like 10, 15 years ago
8879000	8881000	they don't make anymore
8881000	8883000	well then, we can't help you
8883000	8885000	I think it's a PC game
8885000	8887000	if you bought it legitimately
8887000	8889000	then call the people who made the game
8889000	8891000	they can answer
8891000	8893000	he said shady
8893000	8895000	and third I would like to thank Rob
8895000	8897000	for his advice on an earlier episode
8897000	8899000	what you said helped, I told my friend
8899000	8901000	but not family for certain reasons
8901000	8903000	and I'm currently dating someone, once again thanks
8903000	8905000	oh, I'm glad to hear things worked out
8905000	8907000	I remember that email
8907000	8909000	so, um, good
8909000	8911000	I'm really really glad to hear it
8911000	8913000	and thank you Dark Soccer for reading my email
8913000	8915000	if you didn't, what the hell?
8915000	8917000	well, fine, thank you
8917000	8919000	thanks as always, your loyal listener, Haseo Sumiragawa
8919000	8921000	well, I'm
8921000	8923000	very glad, I hope my
8923000	8925000	headache hasn't made me too grumpy when reading it
8925000	8927000	um, oh, good lord
8927000	8929000	long
8929000	8931000	email
8931000	8933000	helping Akai Ripper
8933000	8935000	might be the longest meal in
8935000	8937000	OLR history, I don't know, it might be
8937000	8939000	good morning
8939000	8941000	everyone, this is the other Swede, Jiditz
8941000	8943000	writing in, I usually
8943000	8945000	rant about something, or comment
8945000	8947000	on things that were brought up during the last live show
8947000	8949000	but not this time
8949000	8951000	during episode 376, which is the show
8951000	8953000	before the previous one, Akai Ripper called in
8953000	8955000	and told us of his angst and how Blizzard had wronged him
8955000	8957000	seeing as that episode
8957000	8959000	went up kind of late, I didn't have time
8959000	8961000	to listen to the episode before the next
8961000	8963000	one aired, and couldn't share my knowledge
8963000	8965000	and experience when it comes to activating and playing
8965000	8967000	Starcraft 2, all that is about to change
8967000	8969000	so hold onto your socks and put your pants back
8969000	8971000	on because it's, what?
8971000	8973000	because it's time for a story of epic proportions
8973000	8975000	filled to the brim with angst
8975000	8977000	I have to put my pants back on
8977000	8979000	yeah, cause Rob's been
8979000	8981000	sitting here pantsless the whole time
8981000	8983000	I'm comfortable
8983000	8985000	twas the morning of the 27th
8985000	8987000	of July and the first thing I heard
8987000	8989000	was the blaring of my alarm clock
8989000	8991000	proclaiming it was the time for me to get up
8991000	8993000	had approached
8993000	8995000	excuse me
8995000	8997000	didn't mean to do
8997000	8999000	with slow steps I went up to the kitchen
8999000	9001000	to prepare my breakfast which on this
9001000	9003000	specific day consisted of two slices of toast
9003000	9005000	and a cup of coffee, the perfect combination
9005000	9007000	of breakfast items if you ask me
9007000	9009000	after gulping down my coffee
9009000	9011000	I went to feed Gullen, my polar bear cub
9011000	9013000	and then
9013000	9015000	oh my god, get to the point, like
9015000	9017000	I appreciated the storytelling, but
9017000	9019000	hold on, and then proceeded to get ready
9019000	9021000	to leave the house, now you may think
9021000	9023000	I went up early to stand in line to get my copy of
9023000	9025000	Starcraft 2, but you were sorely mistaken
9025000	9027000	you see, during the summer break I managed to acquire
9027000	9029000	an ingrown nail on my big toe on both my
9029000	9031000	feet, ow, this made walking
9031000	9033000	overall quite painful, so I promptly got in touch with my
9033000	9035000	doctor who had a spot open during the
9035000	9037000	27th of July, Starcraft 2 day
9037000	9039000	after a swift drive to the doctor's office
9039000	9041000	and later an extra 20 minutes of waiting
9041000	9043000	I finally get placed atop one of those
9043000	9045000	odd beds they have at the hospital and the
9045000	9047000	doctor arrives, oh lord
9047000	9049000	ok, ok, ok, ok, ok, look
9049000	9051000	I realize we're all about where every gamer
9051000	9053000	has a voice, and you know, I
9053000	9055000	want everybody to have their say, but
9055000	9057000	next time let's just try
9057000	9059000	some shit went down, and
9059000	9061000	no, I'm trying to see if there's a point
9061000	9063000	Jamie Summers is not your LiveJournal client
9063000	9065000	no I'm not, some
9065000	9067000	and I feel really bad about your
9067000	9069000	ingrown toenails, dude
9069000	9071000	you know what, I
9071000	9073000	I think, get a LiveJournal
9073000	9075000	I think Alan's making
9075000	9077000	a really good point there
9077000	9079000	I feel like an ass now, I'm sorry
9079000	9081000	that was really nice, but
9081000	9083000	I'm not trying to be rude, but it's a
9083000	9085000	3 hour show, not 10
9085000	9087000	we can read this email during the
9087000	9089000	Labor Day show, I'm gonna read
9089000	9091000	I wanna read out of it, fine
9091000	9093000	after all the crap with the doctor
9093000	9095000	paraphrasing of course
9095000	9097000	I wondered how
9097000	9099000	I could get the damn game, I thought
9099000	9101000	I could get it at home, so I went home
9101000	9103000	I'm paraphrasing now, ok
9103000	9105000	thank you
9105000	9107000	you turn it on, start a firefox
9107000	9109000	pull out the credit card
9109000	9111000	and then
9111000	9113000	Blizzard wanted to pay 60 euros
9113000	9115000	which is about 589
9115000	9117000	point 80 Swedish kronor
9117000	9119000	which is 77 bucks
9119000	9121000	for the digital purpose
9121000	9123000	at the local store it's 399 kronor
9123000	9125000	which is 52 dollars
9125000	9127000	so to buy a physical copy
9127000	9129000	it cost him 20 bucks cheaper
9129000	9131000	to go get the physical copy
9131000	9133000	so he did that
9133000	9135000	blah blah blah blah blah
9135000	9137000	gonna install it, gonna play
9137000	9139000	no, ok
9139000	9141000	now this is where I'm gonna read the email again
9141000	9143000	cause I'm pretty down into it now
9143000	9145000	the game said my Blizzard account did not have an
9145000	9147000	activated copy of the game associated to it
9147000	9149000	which I found to be strange since I had seen
9149000	9151000	with my own eyes, a quick google search revealed
9151000	9153000	I was not alone with this problem, but I was sad
9153000	9155000	that no one had found a way to fix it
9155000	9157000	so now we get to the point that might be able
9157000	9159000	thank you, might be able to help everyone
9159000	9161000	who has a similar problem, specifically
9161000	9163000	OkRipper, and having problems
9163000	9165000	getting through to the customer service support line
9165000	9167000	just email customer support
9167000	9169000	I emailed Blizzard support explaining my problem
9169000	9171000	which I had, you know, what I had tried
9171000	9173000	and that I would love some information on what I was doing wrong
9173000	9175000	within 6 hours I had gotten a reply that said they had
9175000	9177000	fixed the problem with the following
9177000	9179000	and the following attempt to play Starcraft 2
9179000	9181000	was successful, and it was beautiful
9181000	9183000	alright, story time isn't
9183000	9185000	is over, but this email isn't
9185000	9187000	so straighten up your backs and get ready for
9187000	9189000	Jiditz Indie Game of the Century

9197000	9199000	and then light the codes for the reward? oops

9209000	9211000	so
9211000	9213000	my friend who happens to be the developer finishes
9213000	9215000	Xbox Indie game Seaside Racing

9217000	9219000	on Xbox Live Marketplace for only 80 Microsoft points

9247000	9249000	I will actually save this
9249000	9251000	email then
9251000	9253000	but I might keep a code for myself
9253000	9255000	I want to play it
9255000	9257000	PS, big thanks to Dark Saga for reading this long email
9257000	9259000	umm kind of
9259000	9261000	oops
9261000	9263000	oops
9263000	9265000	oops
9265000	9267000	oops
9267000	9269000	to tell you a story
9269000	9271000	I would have believed the polar bear
9271000	9273000	and I'll tell you why
9273000	9275000	when Lord Byron
9275000	9277000	you know the poet, went to college
9277000	9279000	he was not allowed to have
9279000	9281000	the rules were no dogs allowed on campus
9281000	9283000	but it did not say anything about a bear
9283000	9285000	so he had a pet bear
9285000	9287000	I think when he went to Cambridge
9287000	9289000	true story
9289000	9291000	true facts
9291000	9293000	so the polar bear could have been possible
9293000	9295000	I wanted to know what kind of toothpaste
9295000	9297000	he used, I could have
9297000	9299000	used what type of magazines
9299000	9301000	in the doctor's office
9301000	9303000	so yeah
9303000	9305000	I just don't think your email was detailed enough
9305000	9307000	to get a sense of
9307000	9309000	the situation
9309000	9311000	and dire urgency
9311000	9313000	I moved it
9313000	9315000	to the inbox
9315000	9317000	I'm glad to hear that emailing blizzard support
9317000	9319000	was a great option
9319000	9321000	I just want to say though like you could have condensed
9321000	9323000	that down to twitter size
9323000	9325000	tell akehripper to email them
9325000	9327000	just
9327000	9329000	move to inbox
9329000	9331000	here's some codes
9331000	9333000	no I'm giving this poor guy a hard time
9333000	9335000	we do appreciate the email
9335000	9337000	I'm sorry I paraphrased
9337000	9339000	but I did read it
9339000	9341000	and it was entertaining
9341000	9343000	and I want a polar bear now
9343000	9345000	I'm just going to replace the pony
9345000	9347000	you know when I go to a restaurant
9347000	9349000	and someone says is there anything else you'd like
9349000	9351000	say a pony
9351000	9353000	now I'm going to say a polar bear, thank you
9353000	9355000	yeah because one time you ended up getting a coney
9355000	9357000	when you asked for a pony the waitress brought you a
9357000	9359000	coney dog and I laughed
9359000	9361000	I took it home to Dan though and he ate it
9361000	9363000	and you totally felt guilty like the waitress was
9363000	9365000	going to take it back going oh
9365000	9367000	you were trying to be funny
9367000	9369000	oh I see
9369000	9371000	people usually do laugh
9371000	9373000	blame the sonic intercom
9373000	9375000	speaker
9375000	9377000	by the way one of the sonics in Roseville closed
9377000	9379000	just so you know
9379000	9381000	I know the one that was built into the
9381000	9383000	what's up with that
9383000	9385000	where was the other one
9385000	9387000	there's one over on
9387000	9389000	I'm sure our international listeners
9389000	9391000	in Mexico really appreciate this talk
9391000	9393000	but I think it's over on like Paradise
9393000	9395000	Grove or whatever that street is called
9395000	9397000	you know what I'm talking about Office 65

9503000	9505000	oh this
9505000	9507000	is cool it's from robaba
9507000	9509000	and it's actually someone I'm a fan of
9509000	9511000	um writer Peter David posted
9511000	9513000	on his blog that he is writing the Tron
9513000	9515000	comic book I'm not sure if it will
9515000	9517000	be released as a graphic novel
9517000	9519000	it probably will as it catches up
9519000	9521000	on the story behind Tron Legacy
9521000	9523000	I'm not a fanboy much but I am a
9523000	9525000	Tron fanboy I actually like Peter David
9525000	9527000	and I've read um
9527000	9529000	some of his Star Trek novels
9529000	9531000	and I think he wrote
9531000	9533000	the novelization for Iron Man
9533000	9535000	so it was I like
9535000	9537000	his writing a lot so
9537000	9539000	all I know about Tron is that I heard a rumor
9539000	9541000	this week that the Muppet
9541000	9543000	3D theater at California Adventure
9543000	9545000	is supposed to be being transformed into a Tron
9545000	9547000	3D preview I know
9547000	9549000	right? that's pretty much
9549000	9551000	the same noise I made when I heard
9553000	9555000	I didn't quite
9555000	9557000	make that noise but close
9557000	9559000	is that it for emails? no
9559000	9561000	like I said we have a bunch and I'm only reading a few
9561000	9563000	another one from robaba
9563000	9565000	now that Microsoft announced Windows Phone 7
9565000	9567000	a near random thought came to mind
9567000	9569000	is Game Room meant for the mobile phone?
9569000	9571000	it also has a heavy emphasis
9571000	9573000	on games in your live account
9573000	9575000	I think they are smart to do this
9575000	9577000	since games would be one of the few things
9577000	9579000	to rope people in you know they actually
9579000	9581000	what was
9581000	9583000	what was Microsoft's the Zune
9583000	9585000	were they
9585000	9587000	were they supposed to have had Zune integration
9587000	9589000	for Xbox Live
9589000	9591000	Indie Games I think was a rumor a while back
9591000	9593000	that XNA would play on the Zune 2
9593000	9595000	remember that thing at E3 where we sat on the big floor
9595000	9597000	with the subwoofer built into it
9597000	9599000	and it vibrated your butt every time the bass
9599000	9601000	would go loud and they had the phone
9601000	9603000	integration thing and people pulling
9603000	9605000	them around for their big pitch
9605000	9607000	yeah yeah
9607000	9609000	I don't remember what it was called
9609000	9611000	but I guess Microsoft
9611000	9613000	released a smartphone that came
9613000	9615000	and went in like three months
9615000	9617000	I posted it out on my Facebook
9617000	9619000	is that this Windows Phone?
9619000	9621000	it had a very
9621000	9623000	specific brand name
9623000	9625000	like a Zune obviously
9625000	9627000	but that's their music player
9627000	9629000	but there was a Microsoft phone
9629000	9631000	that was out for two months
9631000	9633000	I had never even heard of it and they were like
9633000	9635000	oh the kin
9635000	9637000	I remember they had the girl on Facebook
9637000	9639000	going around and meeting people
9639000	9641000	and people were like who the fuck are you
9641000	9643000	anyway
9643000	9645000	ooh a hard
9645000	9647000	question
9647000	9649000	yay
9649000	9651000	what I'm excited
9651000	9653000	you're as exciting as being
9653000	9655000	forced to eat Robin's minstrels
9655000	9657000	greetings
9657000	9659000	I come here today with a question about morality
9659000	9661000	I've always been a PC gamer
9661000	9663000	and usually pay between 20 to 50 bucks
9663000	9665000	for games Wheel of morality
9665000	9667000	turn turn turn tell us the lesson
9667000	9669000	that we should learn
9669000	9671000	and today's moral is
9671000	9673000	early to rise
9673000	9675000	and early to bed may make a man wise
9675000	9677000	but socially dead
9677000	9679000	read the damn email
9679000	9681000	and as long as I've got some good time
9681000	9683000	out of it I'm fine paying that
9683000	9685000	now I won't lie and say I haven't gotten
9685000	9687000	some games by other means either
9687000	9689000	now to my problem I've recently bought a PS3
9689000	9691000	and am appalled that there isn't
9691000	9693000	fire and blood protesting
9693000	9695000	at these $60
9695000	9697000	price points for games
9697000	9699000	as game companies whine when their games
9699000	9701000	don't make tons of profit
9701000	9703000	you know as well as I do
9703000	9705000	that when Steam puts a game up for 50% off sale
9705000	9707000	it sells like hotcakes and the developer makes
9707000	9709000	money has there been any PS3
9709000	9711000	game developers that put their game up for
9711000	9713000	40 to 50 bucks I wonder if they
9713000	9715000	would sell more
9715000	9717000	and thus make more
9717000	9719000	3D Dot Game Heroes was
9719000	9721000	$39.99 maybe
9721000	9723000	$49.99 but it was in that price range
9723000	9725000	you talk about there I believe
9725000	9727000	in America it sold
9727000	9729000	$150K which isn't
9729000	9731000	terrible but I
9731000	9733000	don't know if it'll have a sequel
9733000	9735000	actually for an atlas game that's really good
9735000	9737000	but it also came out around the same time as Lost Planet 2
9737000	9739000	Escape 3, Red Dead Redemption
9739000	9741000	split second blur
9741000	9743000	and that is also one game
9743000	9745000	and I can't think of a whole lot
9745000	9747000	that were cheaper I guess Super Street Fighter 2 was cheaper
9747000	9749000	yes
9749000	9751000	it was also you know an upgrade
9751000	9753000	to a game that you'd already paid
9753000	9755000	50 bucks for before
9755000	9757000	well now he's saying I've included a link
9757000	9759000	to the new PS3 USB hack that might be real
9759000	9761000	of course we covered it earlier
9761000	9763000	and to be truthful at $60 a game is it a little
9763000	9765000	it is a little tempting what do you guys think about it
9765000	9767000	your loyal turtle in Philly
9767000	9769000	is serious turtle
9769000	9771000	um
9771000	9773000	games are expensive but they've always been
9773000	9775000	expensive Street Fighter 2
9775000	9777000	speaking of which since we're talking about all these Street Fighter games
9777000	9779000	the original cartridge was what 70 bucks
9779000	9781000	Mortal Kombat was that bad
9781000	9783000	Chrono Trigger was pushin' 80 at one point
9783000	9785000	killer instinct I paid 60 bucks for
9785000	9787000	at Montgomery Wards
9787000	9789000	and keep in mind this is
9789000	9791000	10-15 years ago without inflation
9791000	9793000	oh no no no I was still in high school
9793000	9795000	no I wasn't I was in college
9795000	9797000	this was about 15 years ago
9797000	9799000	it was before I moved out here so yeah about 15 years ago
9799000	9801000	so you know video games have actually always
9801000	9803000	kind of been a little bit expensive
9803000	9805000	they dropped a lot when they went to CD
9805000	9807000	and that was part of the charm about
9807000	9809000	why CD gaming was really good
9809000	9811000	because they weren't putting all that extra chips
9811000	9813000	in cartridge so by the time the PlayStation 1
9813000	9815000	PlayStation 2 era came around they actually
9815000	9817000	dropped in price quite a bit
9817000	9819000	but now they're slowly climbing back up to where they used to be
9819000	9821000	not that I'm necessarily saying it's
9821000	9823000	justified because you're right there's a lot of
9823000	9825000	crap out there for 60 bucks
9825000	9827000	that really shouldn't be
9827000	9829000	but again what was I saying about
9829000	9831000	the marketing people behind video games earlier
9831000	9833000	that many of them
9833000	9835000	they don't play games oh yeah they don't play the games
9835000	9837000	so everything to them
9837000	9839000	is gold
9839000	9841000	I think that gaming fandom at large
9841000	9843000	or at least this is how the corporations
9843000	9845000	have kind of treated gaming fandom is that
9845000	9847000	they're very fickle
9847000	9849000	and they have a very short attention span
9849000	9851000	once a game is older than three months
9851000	9853000	no one cares
9853000	9855000	like remember when I said buy Starcraft 2
9855000	9857000	six months after it comes out
9857000	9859000	and it's like well no one's
9859000	9861000	everyone's going to have moved on by then
9861000	9863000	you have to charge your 60 bucks
9863000	9865000	because once the game is three months old
9865000	9867000	and you've made your money back by then
9867000	9869000	no one's going to care
9869000	9871000	movies are very similar
9871000	9873000	if you don't make your box office back in several weeks
9873000	9875000	then
9875000	9877000	direct to DVD when everyone else buys it and it becomes a cool hit
9877000	9879000	yeah
9879000	9881000	so I think it has a lot to do with
9881000	9883000	the analysts and their margins
9883000	9885000	of if this game doesn't
9885000	9887000	sell this much past
9887000	9889000	six weeks or whatever
9889000	9891000	their benchmark is then
9891000	9893000	yeah so they charge you 60 bucks for it
9893000	9895000	people who don't play video games are ruining the gaming industry
9895000	9897000	alright
9897000	9899000	I have one last email
9899000	9901000	are you ready?
9901000	9903000	yes
9903000	9905000	um
9905000	9907000	yo guys I just recently got hooked on your show
9907000	9909000	and I was very sad to not hear your
9909000	9911000	angelic lol voices last week
9911000	9913000	anyway I'm emailing you
9913000	9915000	wondering if you have any good PSP
9915000	9917000	titles that you could suggest to me and other
9917000	9919000	listeners as I am slowly getting tired
9919000	9921000	of Monster Hunter 2, Dissidia
9921000	9923000	and Fireteam Bravo
9923000	9925000	two thirds I guess
9925000	9927000	I'll honestly go for
9927000	9929000	almost anything aside from sports games
9929000	9931000	ew thanks and may the Flying Spaghetti
9931000	9933000	Monster bless you pro butcher
9933000	9935000	aka somebody
9935000	9937000	um
9937000	9939000	all hail his noodly
9939000	9941000	goodness uh what was I going to say
9941000	9943000	da da da da
9943000	9945000	if you like Dissidia
9945000	9947000	Final Fantasy 1 and 2 remakes are excellent
9947000	9949000	on the PSP
9949000	9951000	I think Luminous
9951000	9953000	the old puzzler and it's sequel
9953000	9955000	I think the sequel is good
9955000	9957000	some of the best puzzle games they ever put out on the PSP
9957000	9959000	almost was like a reason to own the system
9959000	9961000	I liked Every Extend Extra
9961000	9963000	which was another Mississippi game
9963000	9965000	I liked Papa Locross for a good RPG
9965000	9967000	Loco Roco is a cutesy game
9967000	9969000	if you like cutesy games
9969000	9971000	there's you know
9971000	9973000	PSP has quite a few little highlights in there
9973000	9975000	and a lot of the ports are surprisingly not bad
9975000	9977000	like Little Big Planet on PSP
9977000	9979000	32nd Game Heroes
9979000	9981000	since I was talking about the 3D Dot Game Heroes
9981000	9983000	the 32nd or Half Minute Hero
9983000	9985000	whatever it's called is pretty good too
9985000	9987000	and there's also going to be the new Kingdom Hearts game
9987000	9989000	coming out in September
9989000	9991000	and the Valkyria Chronicles
9991000	9993000	if you like that kind of thing
9993000	9995000	also of course
9995000	9997000	there was I believe a Persona
9997000	9999000	game that just came out
9999000	10001000	on PSP
10001000	10003000	um
10003000	10005000	and there should be more stuff coming out
10005000	10007000	in the 4th quarter of course
10007000	10009000	if you like music games
10009000	10011000	DJ Max is out there
10011000	10013000	and I like Rock Band Unplugged
10013000	10015000	but not everybody liked that
10015000	10017000	but if you like your 2DX type games
10017000	10019000	DJ Max is a good alternative
10019000	10021000	I think that's it for music games
10021000	10023000	Alf in our chat room
10023000	10025000	is suggesting
10025000	10027000	Hatsune Miku Project Diva
10027000	10029000	I forgot about that one
10029000	10031000	good call
10031000	10033000	some of the PSP collections are really good too
10033000	10035000	like the Gradius collection was pretty awesome
10035000	10037000	there's some pretty good collections of games
10037000	10039000	isn't there like a Mega Man collection on PSP as well?
10039000	10041000	it's pretty cool
10041000	10043000	but there's Mega Man
10043000	10045000	Mega Man X remade
10045000	10047000	the 3D
10047000	10049000	they also have the powered up Mega Man
10049000	10051000	the super deformed Mega Man 1
10051000	10053000	alright
10053000	10055000	well there you go, is that it for emails?
10055000	10057000	I thought there was a last minute
10057000	10059000	do you mind if I refresh the inbox?
10059000	10061000	it was from you
10061000	10063000	you were sending it wrong
10063000	10065000	so I'm not checking it
10065000	10067000	are you going to read it?
10067000	10069000	I think you should read it
10069000	10071000	I'm just so upset
10071000	10073000	she's taking away my voice everybody
10073000	10075000	that does not fit with the show
10075000	10077000	I know
10077000	10079000	it's a show where every gamer has a voice
10079000	10081000	and I am not being heard
10081000	10083000	especially since you are a super game analyst
10083000	10085000	I know
10085000	10087000	I am a video game analyst
10087000	10091000	dark sakura just read it and she wants to die
10091000	10093000	what's it say dark sakura?
10093000	10095000	I hate you all so much
10095000	10099000	I want you all to get the hot shotgun bullets to die
10099000	10101000	I wrote dan sucks lol
10101000	10103000	but I spelled sucks s-u-x
10103000	10105000	because I know she loves that
10105000	10107000	that sounds like proper English to me
10107000	10109000	I mean, sucks
10109000	10111000	that's how it turns out on my phone when I text people
10111000	10113000	I don't know what to say
10113000	10115000	I don't know what to say
10115000	10117000	I'm on my own when I text people
10117000	10119000	alright, ow
10119000	10121000	you see this?
10121000	10123000	it's mine now
10123000	10125000	it's landed in my yard
10125000	10127000	what the hell is it, Alan?
10127000	10129000	you're sleeping on the couch
10129000	10131000	alright
10131000	10133000	this is definitely the time of the show
10133000	10135000	I approve of Alan, thank you so much
10135000	10137000	this is definitely the part of the show where we're going to get angsty
10137000	10155000	with a segment we call the FUs of the Week
10155000	10157000	FU to my head hurting
10157000	10161000	and Rob
10161000	10163000	you stink
10163000	10165000	you sucks
10165000	10167000	um
10167000	10169000	I guess FU to lack of sleep
10169000	10171000	but you know
10171000	10173000	the baby doesn't know better
10173000	10175000	he just doesn't know what night and day is yet
10175000	10177000	and he also
10177000	10179000	had trouble pooping
10179000	10181000	hopefully he is past that now
10181000	10183000	because I hate trying to make him poop
10183000	10185000	it's difficult
10185000	10187000	well, it's not difficult
10187000	10189000	but it's gotta be embarrassing for him
10189000	10191000	but he doesn't know anything yet
10191000	10193000	tell Nellie to stop eating onions
10193000	10195000	that has nothing to do with him not pooping
10195000	10197000	you know, I'm really curious
10197000	10199000	if we're going to have a
10199000	10201000	are we going to get
10201000	10203000	are we going to get poop stories every week on OLR now?
10203000	10205000	that would be great
10205000	10207000	sure, I can tell you poop stories
10207000	10209000	see, because he is constipated
10209000	10211000	so he can't go
10211000	10213000	you have to take
10213000	10215000	so he has to have little
10215000	10217000	suppositories
10217000	10219000	put up there
10219000	10221000	poor guy
10221000	10223000	but it triggers him to poop
10223000	10225000	and he this morning
10225000	10227000	he pooped like 3 times
10227000	10229000	congratulations
10229000	10231000	it's good for him
10231000	10233000	but he still grunts all night long
10233000	10235000	and does his kung fu
10235000	10237000	that's quite good for having him watch Ninja Warrior
10237000	10239000	Alan Jeff and the FUs
10239000	10241000	hopefully the don't involve poop
10241000	10243000	his first word should be hadalken
10245000	10247000	FU to salmonella
10247000	10249000	E. coli and other invisible poop
10249000	10251000	that hides in your food and makes you sick
10251000	10253000	when you go on vacation
10253000	10255000	bad eggs?
10255000	10257000	bad chicken I think
10257000	10259000	maybe it was a bad egg
10259000	10261000	alright, my FU of the week goes to the
10261000	10263000	casinos in Reno, Nevada
10263000	10265000	what came first, the bad chicken or the bad egg?
10265000	10267000	my FU goes to the casinos in Reno, Nevada
10267000	10269000	for taking a large, undisclosed
10269000	10271000	sum of my money away from me this weekend
10271000	10273000	it's not supposed to happen
10273000	10275000	meanwhile, all my friends are going
10275000	10277000	I won $400 playing craps
10277000	10279000	how did you do?
10279000	10281000	Dynafire
10281000	10283000	no, I'm happy for my friends
10283000	10285000	but I'm sad for me
10285000	10287000	that's what's really important, right?
10287000	10289000	just a couple more stories
10289000	10291000	for you guys, and then the Skype line
10291000	10293000	we're gonna take your phone calls, oh god
10293000	10295000	Loki, what do you got for us?
10295000	10297000	don't sound too excited there
10297000	10299000	so I have some news
10299000	10301000	about Super Street Fighter 4
10301000	10303000	of course, the arcade version
10303000	10305000	has a few empty slots
10305000	10307000	available for some new characters
10307000	10309000	and that's what they're gonna get
10309000	10311000	they're gonna get some new characters
10311000	10313000	that are gonna be, I guess, exclusive to the arcade
10313000	10315000	at least for right now
10315000	10317000	of course
10317000	10319000	it doesn't say exactly what characters those
10319000	10321000	are gonna be, I guess that is yet to be determined
10321000	10323000	but there will be some new characters
10323000	10325000	coming
10325000	10327000	any characters you'd like to see
10327000	10329000	in Super Street Fighter 4 that haven't
10329000	10331000	come in yet?
10331000	10333000	Alan, I know you're a big fighting game fan
10333000	10335000	or any character that didn't make it from its
10335000	10337000	I'm assuming they're gonna take more characters from Alpha
10337000	10339000	and put them in
10339000	10341000	I wouldn't mind
10341000	10343000	Rolento
10343000	10345000	also, what's her name?
10345000	10347000	Alema?
10347000	10349000	Elena?
10349000	10351000	yeah, Alema's your Warcraft character
10351000	10353000	yeah, from the
10353000	10355000	kick character from Street Fighter 3
10355000	10357000	was awesome, her
10357000	10359000	might get to see it, who knows
10359000	10361000	Darsakra, I know you're a Capcom
10361000	10363000	fan girl too, any
10363000	10365000	extra characters for Street Fighter 4?
10365000	10367000	that I wanna see?
10367000	10369000	well, in that arcade
10369000	10371000	version, I would love to have Sakura
10371000	10373000	if there was another arcade version
10373000	10375000	well, she'd be in there because it's all the regular
10375000	10377000	characters I'm saying for an arcade version
10377000	10379000	I would want Sakura, and
10379000	10381000	other than that, I'd say
10381000	10383000	Ibuki
10383000	10385000	because I was a big Ibuki player
10385000	10387000	or maybe Karin
10387000	10389000	alright
10389000	10391000	I got one more story for you guys
10391000	10393000	I know who would be great
10393000	10395000	you know who would be great?
10395000	10397000	Rainbow Mika
10397000	10399000	she was the funny chick wrestler
10399000	10401000	with the heart pasties
10401000	10403000	alright
10403000	10405000	moving on to another
10405000	10407000	talking about a movie
10407000	10409000	we probably would have talked more about this last week
10409000	10411000	if we actually had a show, but we didn't
10411000	10413000	so this is Scott Pilgrim vs. The World
10413000	10415000	is making a lot of news, but
10415000	10417000	sadly for the gamers, not the kind of news you like to hear
10417000	10419000	it is not doing well at the box office
10419000	10421000	BOMB
10421000	10423000	in its first weekend at the box office
10423000	10425000	it made 10.6 million dollars
10425000	10427000	and while that still is a lot of money
10427000	10429000	when you really put it into context
10429000	10431000	it kinda sucks, because if you look at
10431000	10433000	some of the recent releases that have come out
10433000	10435000	and again
10435000	10437000	what did it cost to make?
10437000	10439000	Scott Pilgrim is, I wanna say 15
10439000	10441000	but I don't know for sure
10441000	10443000	is that profits?
10443000	10445000	no, this is just straight box office tally
10445000	10447000	so then it made less than it cost
10447000	10449000	I believe
10449000	10451000	they're saying that, yes
10451000	10453000	but here's the thing too, I should say this
10453000	10455000	technically it's not a video game movie
10455000	10457000	it's a comic book movie
10457000	10459000	but it's still got the whole
10459000	10461000	video game tie in
10461000	10463000	but this is the really sad part
10463000	10465000	is that the movie
10465000	10467000	Gamer with Gerard Butler
10467000	10469000	made 11.8 million
10469000	10471000	it made more money than Scott Pilgrim's first movie
10471000	10473000	but that's a generic action movie with Gerard Butler
10473000	10475000	I mean this movie didn't
10475000	10477000	have a lot of big
10477000	10479000	names in it, I mean Michael Cera
10479000	10481000	yay, I don't know
10481000	10483000	that and people have really
10483000	10485000	terrible tastes
10485000	10487000	Vampire Sucks
10487000	10489000	being number two
10489000	10491000	not to say that Expendables
10491000	10493000	is a bad movie, but see that's once again a generic
10493000	10495000	action movie, I mean if you like action movies
10495000	10497000	you go see that, it's gonna be awesome
10497000	10499000	whereas this is basically
10499000	10501000	some guy that's
10501000	10503000	falling in love with a woman and he has to fight
10503000	10505000	her exes, I mean that's
10505000	10507000	that's like
10507000	10509000	that's almost like my super ex-girlfriend
10509000	10511000	or something like that
10511000	10513000	which is also lousy, but yeah
10513000	10515000	I mean that's the kind of vibe
10515000	10517000	that sends off, I mean granted it was an awesome
10517000	10519000	movie, but not a lot of people
10519000	10521000	really get that kind of stuff
10521000	10523000	I mean they're not us
10523000	10525000	Well for what it's worth, it made more money than The Wizard
10525000	10527000	which made 4.2 million this opening weekend back in
10527000	10529000	1989, and Alone
10529000	10531000	in the Dark, it did better than a new evil movie
10531000	10533000	Oh well I hope so
10533000	10535000	And Double Dragon with Scott Wolf only made 2.6 million
10535000	10537000	dollars this opening weekend, so at least
10537000	10539000	it did better than that
10539000	10541000	And Scott Wolf does not like people reminding him about
10541000	10543000	that movie
10543000	10545000	So you really liked Scott Pilgrim right?
10545000	10547000	Loki?
10547000	10549000	I loved it, I'd go see it again
10549000	10551000	I just like the whole vibe of it, there's a lot of
10551000	10553000	in-jokes I guess if you're a gamer
10553000	10555000	a lot of things and references that you catch
10555000	10557000	I like the characters in it, like I said
10557000	10559000	one of my favorite characters was Wallace in there
10559000	10561000	because he was just cracking all sorts of
10561000	10563000	comments and stuff throughout the movie
10563000	10565000	But see one of the things that
10565000	10567000	bugged me about the movie is that characters
10567000	10569000	like him, they just kind of disappear
10569000	10571000	there's a lot not resolved
10571000	10573000	I feel like they tried to cram too much
10573000	10575000	with six comic books into one movie
10575000	10577000	but I mean, how else are you going to do it?
10577000	10579000	I don't really know how
10579000	10581000	They did it with Watchmen and Watchmen worked
10581000	10583000	True
10583000	10585000	What did you think of the movie, Alan?
10585000	10587000	I liked how the
10587000	10589000	video game fandom meta stuff
10589000	10591000	was put in
10591000	10593000	As far as the actual story, I didn't
10593000	10595000	care for it, I thought it was kind of creepy
10595000	10597000	and sexist
10597000	10599000	Because I'm all, I don't know
10599000	10601000	I'm too serious about that kind of stuff
10601000	10603000	Because you're a lesbian
10603000	10605000	They glossed over some of the characters, like the twins for example
10605000	10607000	They kind of glossed over who they even were
10607000	10609000	We just knew they were twins, she dated them at some point
10609000	10611000	and they had a battle
10611000	10613000	and that was it
10613000	10615000	I don't even know why they were terrible
10615000	10617000	Well, I kind of think they should have just cut that scene
10617000	10619000	out of the movie and just had her have five exes
10619000	10621000	You know what I mean?
10621000	10623000	And so they could develop something else
10623000	10625000	It just seemed a little strange
10625000	10627000	Part of what I really liked about it
10627000	10629000	I think I liked it more than Alan did
10629000	10631000	Although I did have some problems with it
10631000	10633000	including an unlikeable main character
10633000	10635000	I thought that
10635000	10637000	it was so random in some parts
10637000	10639000	that I couldn't help but laugh my ass off
10639000	10641000	Vegan police?
10641000	10643000	Yes, you're a vegan
10643000	10645000	Telekinesis
10645000	10647000	I just liked all the
10647000	10649000	different random things
10649000	10651000	in there, like for example
10651000	10653000	At the end where he's complaining
10653000	10655000	He's like
10655000	10657000	I can't believe he did that
10657000	10659000	It took me two hours!
10659000	10661000	Two hours to look up all their information
10661000	10663000	and contact numbers
10663000	10665000	It was funny
10665000	10667000	The League of Evil Exes
10667000	10669000	See, I thought for sure that he'd become
10669000	10671000	part of the League of Evil Exes
10671000	10673000	at the end of the movie
10673000	10675000	Oh my god, spoiler!
10675000	10677000	I said I thought that he would
10677000	10679000	Didn't say he actually did
10679000	10681000	Alright, anyhow
10681000	10683000	It was, um
10683000	10685000	It was, it was okay
10685000	10687000	No, I'd say I liked it
10687000	10689000	I think I liked the direction
10689000	10691000	and the ambiance of the movie
10691000	10693000	and just the whole, like, you know
10693000	10695000	just turning my brain off and enjoying it
10695000	10697000	as like a video game, you know
10697000	10699000	and I'd see it again, especially because
10699000	10701000	Dark Soccer still hasn't seen it
10701000	10703000	And seriously, you need to check out the PlayStation Network game
10703000	10705000	It is awesome
10705000	10707000	I bet it makes a really good
10707000	10709000	video game, ironically
10709000	10711000	It's an awesome game, and it's by that guy
10711000	10713000	who, remember when we were doing
10713000	10715000	Marvel vs. games
10715000	10717000	or whatever, that you guys voted off
10717000	10719000	Oh, how funny
10719000	10721000	Because he does really awesome pixel art
10721000	10723000	I don't remember his name now
10723000	10725000	But yeah, he did the whole game
10725000	10727000	River City Ransom-ish
10727000	10729000	Well, I love River City Ransom
10729000	10731000	I've been playing with the avatar creator
10731000	10733000	on the website, though, that's pretty fun
10733000	10735000	Yeah, I made a little avatar on there, too
10735000	10737000	Ooh, what website?
10737000	10739000	It's on the Scott Pilgrim vs. the World website
10739000	10741000	Look at her Facebook or my Facebook, it's there
10741000	10743000	Alright, let's open up the Skype line
10743000	10745000	Take some calls
10745000	10747000	1-877-GAME-OLR is our phone number
10747000	10749000	or you can give us a call on the Skype line
10749000	10751000	Our username on Skype is
10751000	10753000	OrangeLoungeRadio, that's all one word
10753000	10755000	But as a reminder, if you are gonna call us
10755000	10757000	with your computer, please
10757000	10759000	call Echo123
10759000	10761000	first, and I think in the newer versions of Skype
10761000	10763000	they actually say, make a test call
10763000	10765000	Do not skip that step, it's very important
10765000	10767000	because a lot of our crap calls
10767000	10769000	come in because you didn't test your connection
10769000	10771000	and then we know
10771000	10773000	Or you can always use the trusty old regular
10773000	10775000	telephone and you don't have to screw around with that too much
10775000	10777000	1-877-GAME-OLR
10777000	10779000	Meanwhile, while we wait for some calls
10779000	10781000	to come in, are there any last minute stories?
10781000	10783000	Yeah, Just Dance 2
10783000	10785000	just announced the
10785000	10787000	track list for that
10787000	10789000	some songs that they have in there that you can
10789000	10791000	dance to, I guess
10791000	10793000	I'm getting hammered with calls, we better go to the calls
10793000	10795000	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
10795000	10797000	Hello?
10797000	10799000	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
10799000	10801000	It's Kine
10801000	10803000	Hi, Kine, how are you?
10803000	10805000	What's on your mind, buddy?
10805000	10807000	Not too much
10807000	10809000	I was calling in about
10809000	10811000	the Poof Poof reference
10811000	10813000	in Dragon Quest 9
10813000	10815000	Yes, please, what about it?
10817000	10819000	The reference
10819000	10821000	in 3D Dot Game Heroes
10821000	10823000	is actually from a previous Dragon Quest
10823000	10825000	off of the NES
10825000	10827000	Really?
10827000	10829000	It was titled Dragon Warriors
10829000	10831000	here in the States
10831000	10833000	Yeah, and I can't remember which one it was
10833000	10835000	but I think it was the first Dragon Warrior
10835000	10837000	that came out
10837000	10839000	I played it off the last one in the trilogy
10839000	10841000	I didn't even catch
10841000	10843000	that as being an original
10843000	10845000	Dragon Warrior reference, I just thought it was
10845000	10847000	funny, because don't they do this whole thing
10847000	10849000	where they, like, in 3D Dot Game Heroes
10849000	10851000	it's been a couple months since I played it, but don't they do this whole
10851000	10853000	like little switcheroo thing where it ends up
10853000	10855000	it's her dad giving the
10855000	10857000	you know, massage or whatever they play it off
10857000	10859000	that's going to get you mad?
10859000	10861000	Yeah, and that's why I remember
10861000	10863000	what I said, that's also the inside
10863000	10865000	joke, there's a lot of Dragon
10865000	10867000	Quest and all the references inside
10867000	10869000	of that game
10869000	10871000	In like the first round, you can go in the back
10871000	10873000	and there's a slide and there must be
10873000	10875000	humans from Dragon Quest 3
10875000	10877000	so
10877000	10879000	I thought
10879000	10881000	No, I appreciate it, in fact
10881000	10883000	it's kind of funny to know that now that
10883000	10885000	that actually was from a
10885000	10887000	another game, it was kind of another
10887000	10889000	little reference and not just something they made up
10889000	10891000	but I like that 3D Dot Game Heroes
10891000	10893000	man, if you played, especially if you like
10893000	10895000	actually grew up with the 8 and 16 bit games
10895000	10897000	even if you didn't, if you have an appreciation for them
10897000	10899000	but especially if you did like grow up with them
10899000	10901000	I think they're just, like
10901000	10903000	it's just a hilarious video game because it's made by
10903000	10905000	nerds like you and me, clearly
10905000	10907000	Yeah, it was
10907000	10909000	definitely marked before
10909000	10911000	people that grew up, you know
10911000	10913000	in the 8 and 16 bit era
10913000	10915000	Um
10915000	10917000	Oh yeah, that was the other thing
10917000	10919000	I demand a
10919000	10921000	Commodore 64 episode
10921000	10923000	Oh yes, I think I was joking about this
10923000	10925000	on the forums, the Commodore 64 episode
10925000	10927000	of OLR, well if we end up doing
10927000	10929000	this whole marathon thing we're talking about for
10929000	10931000	Labor Day, I'm gonna see what we can do about
10931000	10933000	bringing some Commodore 64 content into it
10933000	10935000	absolutely, maybe I'll make
10935000	10937000	the cast sit down and play what would be a
10937000	10939000	good old school Commodore 64
10939000	10941000	game to make people play, we could actually, we could
10941000	10943000	do a Summer Games 2
10943000	10945000	Championship and we can all
10945000	10947000	play the different
10947000	10949000	countries, that would be awesome
10949000	10951000	Alright, well Kyan, thank you so much for the call
10951000	10953000	and have fun with 3D.GameHeroes
10953000	10955000	it's a great value
10955000	10957000	Alright, thank you
10957000	10959000	Alright, later
10959000	10961000	1877 Game OLR, if you'd like to give us a call
10961000	10963000	or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio
10963000	10965000	Let's go to another call, hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio
10965000	10967000	Who's this?
10967000	10969000	Hey, this is Butcher
10969000	10971000	either on email or DarkKiske
10971000	10973000	on Twitter
10973000	10975000	Butcher or DarkKiske on Twitter
10975000	10977000	What's on your mind?
10977000	10979000	I just want to make this quick
10979000	10981000	Thank you guys for giving me
10981000	10983000	PSP game suggestions earlier
10983000	10985000	Oh, this was your email, okay, yes
10985000	10987000	And that's about it
10987000	10989000	right now, but
10989000	10991000	I had something else and it
10991000	10993000	completely skipped my mind
10993000	10995000	Uh oh, see
10995000	10997000	this happens to us a lot when we do live radio
10997000	10999000	is that we're actually doing a show and then we forget
10999000	11001000	what we wanted to talk about, but that's why we always
11001000	11003000	write things down before we
11003000	11005000	do the show, but even then it sometimes
11005000	11007000	doesn't help us, but okay, so
11007000	11009000	you got, you were asking
11009000	11011000	for the PSP games?
11011000	11013000	Yeah, that was me
11013000	11015000	Did any of those sound interesting to you? You think you might actually go out
11015000	11017000	and pick any of those up?
11017000	11019000	Yeah, once I actually get a job I'm probably going to go out
11019000	11021000	and hunt down a few Final Fantasy games
11021000	11023000	You know, unfortunately, that is the
11023000	11025000	problem a lot of people are having right now in this economy
11025000	11027000	is it's just, it's kind of ironic
11027000	11029000	because we got that email about the high prices
11029000	11031000	of games too, and
11031000	11033000	it's just, you know, within this economy
11033000	11035000	it's so hard to kind of afford
11035000	11037000	a lot of that, and a couple weeks ago here on
11037000	11039000	the show, it was about three weeks ago now, we had that gal
11039000	11041000	and I'm so sorry, I forgot her name, what was her
11041000	11043000	I remember her real name, but she went by something
11043000	11045000	else here on the show, the gal who sat here
11045000	11047000	the night Loki had the baby
11047000	11049000	Oh, Ashley, um
11049000	11051000	No, I forgot what her
11051000	11053000	Yeah, her online name
11053000	11055000	I forgot what her online name was, but Ashley
11055000	11057000	Yeah, I knew that, but it's her online name, I couldn't remember
11057000	11059000	But she was a big on the budget gamer
11059000	11061000	She's going to be back
11061000	11063000	Yeah, she likes the cheap games
11063000	11065000	You know, there's a difference between cheap
11065000	11067000	and piracy, and you know
11067000	11069000	there's a lot of worthy cheap games out there
11069000	11071000	and free ones, because she said she was a big player
11071000	11073000	of what was it, like Runescape?
11073000	11075000	Was that the game? And it's like free
11075000	11077000	You can play that online
11077000	11079000	Alright, well anyway, good luck with the PSP
11079000	11081000	and let us know if you do find some good games
11081000	11083000	to pass along to the listeners, let us know, alright?
11083000	11085000	Yeah, sure thing
11085000	11087000	Alright, take care buddy
11087000	11089000	Oh yeah, go ahead
11089000	11091000	Thanks to you, to you for getting my name wrong
11091000	11093000	early on Twitter, it's not
11093000	11095000	DarkKisuke, what did you say, Kisuke?
11095000	11097000	Yeah
11097000	11099000	Anyway, that's it
11099000	11101000	Ah, I do my best, at least I read it
11101000	11103000	Alright, take care, bye
11103000	11105000	Alright, have a good night
11105000	11107000	I try my best
11107000	11109000	It's not spelled out phonetically
11109000	11111000	I'm probably not going to get it
11111000	11113000	We're getting a lot of calls tonight, but this is awesome
11113000	11115000	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
11115000	11117000	Hello
11117000	11119000	Oh, it's Xenocore
11119000	11121000	Hey, how you doing? A little delay there, that's alright
11121000	11123000	Hey, no problem man, it's been a long time
11123000	11125000	I know it has, how are you doing Xenocore?
11125000	11127000	Well, I've moved
11127000	11129000	five states, uh
11129000	11131000	managed to secure a job after three attempts
11131000	11133000	and many layoffs, and now I'm
11133000	11135000	working for Dell
11135000	11137000	Well congratulations
11137000	11139000	Well, doing army support
11139000	11141000	Very cool, wait, you moved from where to where?
11141000	11143000	You were in what, Virginia before?
11143000	11145000	I was in, uh, I was in Sebastian, Florida
11145000	11147000	Now I'm in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma
11147000	11149000	Oh, wow, okay, that's quite a move
11149000	11151000	Going from the east to the midwest
11151000	11153000	Wow, alright, well
11153000	11155000	How you liking Oklahoma? I've been there
11155000	11157000	once, I was 17 years old
11157000	11159000	Many years old
11159000	11161000	It's pretty much like living on a space colony
11161000	11163000	as close as you can imagine
11163000	11165000	There's little things to do here and there of everything
11165000	11167000	but you try to go outside the perimeter and there's
11167000	11169000	nothing but wasteland
11169000	11171000	Yeah, it's kind of isolated
11171000	11173000	That's pretty much where it's at
11173000	11175000	Well, what's on your mind tonight?
11175000	11177000	Uh, not much, not much
11177000	11179000	I'm actually getting ready to restart my
11179000	11181000	show, and I've been writing
11181000	11183000	for the Electra Sisterhood magazine
11183000	11185000	in the meantime
11185000	11187000	I have heard they launched a magazine
11187000	11189000	and it's not an e-zine, right?
11189000	11191000	It's an actual tangible super magazine, right?
11191000	11193000	No, no
11193000	11195000	You can get it in either form, they got it in PDF
11195000	11197000	as well as print
11197000	11199000	Wow, that's good for them, that can't be an easy venture
11199000	11201000	for them, so
11201000	11203000	I always seem to run into Ninja Sister at trade shows
11203000	11205000	and I think she's adorable, I really like her
11205000	11207000	She's been on some of the OLR special shows
11207000	11209000	She's great
11209000	11211000	Yeah, we're pimping everything out on landofesh.com
11211000	11213000	now, so
11213000	11215000	Oh, very nice, I didn't know there was a whole new website
11215000	11217000	We'll go check that out, absolutely
11217000	11219000	What kind of articles are you writing over there?
11219000	11221000	Well, the last one I did was a review on how
11221000	11223000	the marketing departments of all these games seem to
11223000	11225000	love to play with the words
11225000	11227000	and tell us what game is
11227000	11229000	actually not that, like how I got
11229000	11231000	pissed off with Demon Souls, I wrote all about it
11231000	11233000	in there. Very interesting, because
11233000	11235000	we were just talking earlier about
11235000	11237000	and I apologize, this might not have been what you
11237000	11239000	wanted to call in about, but we were talking a minute ago
11239000	11241000	about how it seems like a lot of marketing
11241000	11243000	departments don't actually play
11243000	11245000	video games at all
11245000	11247000	Oh yeah, that's corporate nature
11247000	11249000	in general, they'll sell the stuff without even
11249000	11251000	getting aware of what the hell they're selling
11251000	11253000	Yeah, you think it would be better if they did?
11253000	11255000	Eh, not
11255000	11257000	really
11257000	11259000	Sometimes it's just the mentality
11259000	11261000	The guy who can survive doing sales for a living
11261000	11263000	really doesn't have a lot of time to even
11263000	11265000	play these things, so you know
11265000	11267000	I just rope it up to that's the way the
11267000	11269000	world is and keep going
11269000	11271000	Gotcha. Well, I think I got us
11271000	11273000	off on a tangent, but besides your
11273000	11275000	work on ESH, what else is going on
11275000	11277000	in your world that you might want
11277000	11279000	to call in about tonight?
11279000	11281000	Not much, not much. I did see
11281000	11283000	Scott Pilgrim, but the one
11283000	11285000	guy, actually I just recently saw it today and
11285000	11287000	was quite happy. I started Facebooking all
11287000	11289000	over the place for it, but the one
11289000	11291000	thing that surprised me that I haven't
11291000	11293000	seen before was the
11293000	11295000	voice of reason and the
11295000	11297000	guiding light in the entire show
11297000	11299000	was Scott's
11299000	11301000	roommate, and this is the best
11301000	11303000	possible example I've seen of just
11303000	11305000	a normal person who just
11305000	11307000	happens to like guys too that's
11307000	11309000	treated with a little bit more respect
11309000	11311000	than I've seen in other mediums
11311000	11313000	things getting better lately. I
11313000	11315000	kind of agree with that, that was
11315000	11317000	it was pretty cool the way that
11317000	11319000	it was just like the cool
11319000	11321000	gay friend and that's just the way it was, but I think it
11321000	11323000	also shows like I kind of go
11323000	11325000	back to the original comics and from
11325000	11327000	what I've read on the original comics is that
11327000	11329000	that character was inspired by a real
11329000	11331000	life interaction that the
11331000	11333000	author of the comics had with a former
11333000	11335000	roommate of his. I think it just kind of goes
11335000	11337000	to show that the younger generation
11337000	11339000	especially, you know, and when I say that
11339000	11341000	God I make myself sound so old, but just
11341000	11343000	even folks that are like 10-15 years younger
11343000	11345000	than us, like it's just not even an
11345000	11347000	issue anymore. And if you look at the people who
11347000	11349000	do have an issue with
11349000	11351000	you know, same sex
11351000	11353000	relations and what have you, it's almost always
11353000	11355000	old fuddy duddies
11355000	11357000	you know, like that
11357000	11359000	I don't know why they're so threatened, but
11359000	11361000	it's just comforting to know that you know
11361000	11363000	especially a lot of the folks that listen to this show
11363000	11365000	it's just whatever
11365000	11367000	you know, it's just not even a big deal
11367000	11369000	you know, so I think it's great
11369000	11371000	cause that's the way it should be, it's just people like
11371000	11373000	who they like, I don't even think
11373000	11375000	you should have to be gay or
11375000	11377000	straight, just be
11377000	11379000	nice
11379000	11381000	Exactly, exactly
11381000	11383000	All we need
11383000	11385000	And I have one gaming accomplishment I gotta share
11385000	11387000	before I go, I managed
11387000	11389000	to find a working
11389000	11391000	version of Escape
11391000	11393000	from the Planet of Robot Monsters
11393000	11395000	and I got to the last dude and lost all the
11395000	11397000	rest of my credits there, it was epic, I loved it
11399000	11401000	How long did it take you to do that?
11401000	11403000	It took me about a good hour
11403000	11405000	but that game was
11405000	11407000	jimmied so that way we could still use credits
11407000	11409000	they took off the continue
11409000	11411000	limitation and everything, I actually got pretty
11411000	11413000	decent at it, but that game is brutal
11413000	11415000	it's as brutal as it should and half these games
11415000	11417000	that can only be played through MAME
11417000	11419000	right now, they need to be re-released
11419000	11421000	like whether on PSN or Xbox
11421000	11423000	Live or whatever, at least the newer ones from like the
11423000	11425000	late 90's and such
11425000	11427000	but that's all I got
11427000	11429000	keep gaming alive, excellent job guys
11429000	11431000	I'll talk to you in the future
11431000	11433000	Thank you so much for the phone call, I appreciate it buddy
11433000	11435000	Have a good one
11435000	11437000	Later, you too, bye bye
11437000	11439000	We can take some more calls

11445000	11447000	and we'll
11447000	11449000	take some more calls, looks like things finally
11449000	11451000	slowed up here for a minute, we can get back to the
11451000	11453000	Dance 2 story if you want
11453000	11455000	Some of the songs in there, including some of the
11455000	11457000	really annoying songs, they've
11457000	11459000	got
11459000	11461000	let's see here, Kesha
11461000	11463000	with TikTok
11463000	11465000	OutKast with
11465000	11467000	I was just thinking there's not enough gutter
11467000	11469000	trash on the Wii
11469000	11471000	The Pussycat Dolls
11471000	11473000	When I Grow Up
11475000	11477000	I don't recognize a lot
11477000	11479000	of these songs
11479000	11481000	Avril Lavigne, Girlfriend
11483000	11485000	Let's see here
11485000	11487000	Bonnie M. Rasputin
11489000	11491000	Cher the Shoop Shoop song
11491000	11493000	Donna Summer's
11493000	11495000	Hot Stuff
11497000	11499000	This game sounds more and more like a 70's
11499000	11501000	disco with each song that you read
11501000	11503000	Ike and Tina Turner, Proud Mary
11503000	11505000	Wow, alright look
11505000	11507000	we're gonna go to a phone call to save this
11507000	11509000	We also have Justice with D.A.N.C.E
11509000	11511000	and that song is awesome
11511000	11513000	Hi you're on Orange Lawn's Radio, who's this?
11513000	11515000	Hey it's Ron, how's everyone doing tonight?
11515000	11517000	I am great, how are you?
11517000	11519000	I'm good
11519000	11521000	Before we get to you Loki
11521000	11523000	congratulations
11523000	11525000	Thank you
11525000	11527000	You're welcome
11527000	11529000	I saw Scott Pilgrim vs.
11529000	11531000	the World on Saturday
11531000	11533000	I enjoyed the movie but
11533000	11535000	the only issue
11535000	11537000	that I had
11537000	11539000	maybe because it's my
11539000	11541000	ginormous ego and my portrayal
11541000	11543000	and my odd views of the world
11543000	11545000	I just didn't like how
11545000	11547000	Scott Pilgrim was portrayed
11547000	11549000	as this socially inept
11549000	11551000	awkward geek
11551000	11553000	maybe it's because of the people that
11553000	11555000	I've run with throughout the years
11555000	11557000	I've never come across anybody
11557000	11559000	as bad as him
11559000	11561000	I can see that
11561000	11563000	Yeah
11563000	11565000	Yeah
11565000	11567000	To me
11567000	11569000	Isn't that kind of what Michael Cera is
11569000	11571000	in every movie he's in?
11571000	11573000	and Arrested Development to some extent
11573000	11575000	Michael Cera needs a shot
11575000	11577000	Jesse Hinesburg should have been in that movie
11577000	11579000	He was the kid from
11579000	11581000	Zombie Land
11583000	11585000	Yeah I know
11585000	11587000	What's funny is people think
11587000	11589000	that Michael Cera was in Zombieland
11589000	11591000	because they keep mistaking both guys
11591000	11593000	I'm like no that's two separate people
11593000	11595000	Hehehe
11595000	11597000	But did you like
11597000	11599000	otherwise besides the whole
11599000	11601000	main character which is funny enough
11601000	11603000	was one of the big problems I had with the movie
11603000	11605000	did you kind of like everything else about it?
11605000	11607000	Yeah I did
11607000	11609000	I even had to convince my best friend
11609000	11611000	to watch the movie
11611000	11613000	so maybe her view will be a little bit different
11613000	11615000	if she watches it
11615000	11617000	Yeah
11617000	11619000	It's kind of a bummer
11619000	11621000	that it's doing so terribly at the box office
11621000	11623000	because you know
11623000	11625000	I feel like people will never try to do
11625000	11627000	another movie like it
11627000	11629000	Why do you think the movie is bombing so terribly?
11629000	11631000	Simply put
11631000	11633000	it went up against The Expendables
11633000	11635000	and Julia Roberts
11635000	11637000	That's the only reason why it tanked out
11637000	11639000	Now if it went up
11639000	11641000	if it was out during an off season
11641000	11643000	it would have done good
11643000	11645000	because personally when I saw the poster
11645000	11647000	I'm like hmm maybe
11647000	11649000	I'm like okay I'll go see this
11649000	11651000	then The Expendables happens to show up
11651000	11653000	I'm like this is my 80's childhood right here
11653000	11655000	80's childhood
11655000	11657000	versus
11657000	11659000	geekdom geek fandom versus 80's childhood
11659000	11661000	Yeah exactly
11661000	11663000	and I'm asking people
11663000	11665000	give me faith in the movie
11665000	11667000	don't give me reasons to see it
11667000	11669000	just give me faith in it
11669000	11671000	unfortunately there was no faith
11671000	11673000	For me with The Expendables
11673000	11675000	it's like wow everything I don't
11675000	11677000	like about 80's movies in one movie
11677000	11679000	I'm like there's the perfect movie for me to
11679000	11681000	not see
11681000	11683000	At least that's
11683000	11685000	how I felt about it but you know
11685000	11687000	Well
11687000	11689000	at least I'm happy that
11689000	11691000	the movie is getting a sequel but you know that's just me
11691000	11693000	Alright
11693000	11695000	Alright
11695000	11697000	anything else you want to share with the
11697000	11699000	listeners tonight?
11699000	11701000	I picked up another DJ Hero
11701000	11703000	turntable controller for 20 bucks
11703000	11705000	and I'm looking forward to DJ Hero 2
11707000	11709000	Yeah now's a good time to get a
11709000	11711000	turntable controller if you have any interest in DJ Hero 2
11711000	11713000	because you could probably get the turntable by itself
11713000	11715000	and then DJ Hero 2 by itself
11715000	11717000	for much cheaper
11717000	11719000	than the combo
11719000	11721000	Maybe because I think it was only on sale
11721000	11723000	with Best Buy and Kmart
11723000	11725000	for like two weeks only
11725000	11727000	and now I've been checking prices
11727000	11729000	it's back at the regular price and my turntable
11729000	11731000	control was on back order for about a week and a half
11731000	11733000	Tekken 6 is on sale for 10 bucks
11733000	11735000	at Best Buy
11735000	11737000	Much better than 60
11737000	11739000	If you have the $28 coupon card
11739000	11741000	which you can print out
11741000	11743000	Alright Rob we're going to let you go so we can
11743000	11745000	try and get at least one more call in here before we sign off
11745000	11747000	for the night but thanks so much for your call okay buddy?
11747000	11749000	Not the problem Luigi
11749000	11751000	out here
11751000	11753000	Alright bye take care
11753000	11755000	Let's see one more call here
11755000	11757000	I'm going to try to get to tonight. Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio
11757000	11759000	who's this?
11759000	11761000	DJ Blaziken
11761000	11763000	DJ Blaziken what is on your mind?
11763000	11765000	Not much
11765000	11767000	other than some possible new game
11767000	11769000	for Butcher to pick up when he gets in cash
11769000	11771000	Actually
11771000	11773000	these games went down to like
11773000	11775000	10 bucks
11775000	11777000	and they are
11777000	11779000	Twisted Metal
11779000	11781000	I think
11781000	11783000	they even dropped
11783000	11785000	I think it's
11785000	11787000	I think it's
11787000	11789000	It was Quiz World for $7.99
11789000	11791000	on PSN
11791000	11793000	and then
11793000	11795000	oh yeah
11795000	11797000	Beats
11797000	11799000	which I also have a
11799000	11801000	review for
11801000	11803000	which it's kind of like
11803000	11805000	if you were to take
11805000	11807000	oh
11807000	11809000	Beatmania and just have three lines
11811000	11813000	that's what Beats is but the cool thing is
11813000	11815000	it's kind of like Stepmania
11815000	11817000	or ITG
11817000	11819000	where you can use your own music and
11819000	11821000	it goes off your memory card
11821000	11823000	like your whole music library
11823000	11825000	that you got on there
11825000	11827000	A lot of those games that make their own music
11827000	11829000	and I reviewed one here on the show just like I think
11829000	11831000	a couple weeks ago we were last on the air
11831000	11833000	there's that game that was on Steam like
11833000	11835000	Rhythm Zone or something like that that uses your own
11835000	11837000	MP3's and it's
11837000	11839000	Bootsy to use a word that Irene uses a lot
11839000	11841000	it's a Bootsy game because like
11841000	11843000	the note patterns that come up with the music you make
11843000	11845000	are just not interesting
11845000	11847000	yet a game like Audio Surf
11847000	11849000	I think is actually a lot better
11849000	11851000	and it makes its own patterns too
11851000	11853000	based on the MP3's you're playing but you're not
11853000	11855000	hitting buttons at random
11855000	11857000	like flailing on your keyboard in time
11857000	11859000	to the music. Audio Surf the game
11859000	11861000	is kind of different it's like a puzzle game mixed
11861000	11863000	with music mixed with action
11863000	11865000	I don't know it's different so it works for me
11865000	11867000	but I mean is this other game
11867000	11869000	you're talking about button flailing or what?
11869000	11871000	Okay
11871000	11873000	actually but this one though
11873000	11875000	it uses all four
11875000	11877000	the extra circle square buttons on your PSP
11877000	11879000	and
11879000	11881000	but the cool thing is
11881000	11883000	well here's the only jip of it
11883000	11885000	I tried to play along with some of my
11885000	11887000	DDR soundtrack songs
11887000	11889000	it won't work with them. It doesn't work with
11889000	11891000	anything under
11891000	11893000	two or three minutes
11893000	11895000	Oh that's weird
11895000	11897000	so I hate to say it for all you
11897000	11899000	B-Money fans who wanted to use your
11899000	11901000	B-Money soundtracks
11901000	11903000	for beats you're out of luck
11903000	11905000	That is kind of weird that it
11905000	11907000	won't work for such short songs
11907000	11909000	I wonder if that has to do with some type of like scoring
11909000	11911000	algorithm or
11911000	11913000	I can't even think of achievements
11913000	11915000	It's a scoring system but yet it'll work
11915000	11917000	with stuff like
11917000	11919000	the Initial V soundtrack
11919000	11921000	which I have
11921000	11923000	and like the only
11923000	11925000	B-Money song I have on there from
11925000	11927000	that which
11927000	11929000	I think everyone knows Night of Fire
11929000	11931000	of course
11931000	11933000	you know and
11933000	11935000	a lot of the old DDR songs
11935000	11937000	and I mean old old old DDR songs
11937000	11939000	came from a series in Japan
11939000	11941000	called Dance Mania X not to be
11941000	11943000	confused with Dance Maniacs
11943000	11945000	or just the Dance Mania albums
11945000	11947000	and if you can go to those albums
11947000	11949000	you can find a lot of longer
11949000	11951000	versions of old school B-Money songs
11951000	11953000	because they were all trimmed down from
11953000	11955000	CD cuts that were three or four minutes
11955000	11957000	long
11957000	11959000	Wow I had no clue
11959000	11961000	of that. There you go you learn something
11961000	11963000	new every day. Alright
11963000	11965000	Yeah Dance Maniacs
11965000	11967000	I do have one
11967000	11969000	and so
11969000	11971000	basically I was just
11971000	11973000	wondering what the heck else
11973000	11975000	you know oh yeah
11975000	11977000	even though it's import only
11977000	11979000	but I say it's worth it
11979000	11981000	if you love racing games
11981000	11983000	a lot of stuff like Ridge Racer might be starting to get tired
11983000	11985000	of it but also loves anime
11985000	11987000	Initial D
11987000	11989000	Street Stage
11989000	11991000	with
11991000	11993000	PSP
11993000	11995000	which
11995000	11997000	I don't know where else to get that because
11997000	11999000	nowhere
11999000	12001000	sells it here in America
12001000	12003000	Well if it's not something
12003000	12005000	you can get on the Playstation
12005000	12007000	store you have to
12007000	12009000	kind of go the harder routes of trying to find
12009000	12011000	Fish Up a Copy on eBay or Amazon
12011000	12013000	or one of those but they're you know
12013000	12015000	the internet really
12015000	12017000	so
12017000	12019000	Alright well anything else on your mind buddy before we let you
12019000	12021000	go
12021000	12023000	Hey I got a little question
12023000	12025000	for you on the fact
12025000	12027000	you're like I saw
12027000	12029000	something that was back on the old
12029000	12031000	games and it said a little thing on your profile like
12031000	12033000	you had some previous college and high school
12033000	12035000	broadcasting experience
12035000	12037000	and I got asked this too
12037000	12039000	what got you interested in broadcasting
12039000	12041000	That's a really good
12041000	12043000	question
12043000	12045000	That's because Rob
12045000	12047000	is a big attention whore
12047000	12049000	Partially that
12049000	12051000	Here's the thing when I was in college
12051000	12053000	No I know but no part of it is I'm
12053000	12055000	an attention whore I do I like the
12055000	12057000	getting the like for instance last night
12057000	12059000	at the Rocky thing that I was doing
12059000	12061000	I got to lead you know four thousand
12061000	12063000	some odd give or take a few thousand
12063000	12065000	in doing the time warp and that felt
12065000	12067000	awesome like just you know like all the
12067000	12069000	people doing you know what I'm telling them to do
12069000	12071000	is just kind of cool like you know
12071000	12073000	it was cool but to be honest
12073000	12075000	where that all comes from I got into
12075000	12077000	radio in college because I actually originally
12077000	12079000	originally originally was studying
12079000	12081000	to do computer science because you know I'm a nerd
12081000	12083000	I thought I'd like computers but for me
12083000	12085000	wasn't for me I didn't like it it's for other
12085000	12087000	people but not for me I actually had a really bad
12087000	12089000	professor that I think kind of just turned me off of the whole
12089000	12091000	thing but I switched
12091000	12093000	to studying television I was
12093000	12095000	actually wanting to be for a little bit I wanted to be a weather
12095000	12097000	man and then I was going to be a broadcast
12097000	12099000	journalist and I actually interned for a little while
12099000	12101000	at a CBS station up where I went to school
12101000	12103000	but I found that the
12103000	12105000	television industry from my perspective
12105000	12107000	from doing all that again for me
12107000	12109000	you know obviously there's people that are into it but for me
12109000	12111000	too competitive and too cut throat and
12111000	12113000	you know kind of the same thing with radio to some extent
12113000	12115000	but when I was doing college radio I kind of
12115000	12117000	got to do things on my own terms and you know
12117000	12119000	it didn't matter if no one was listening even if one
12119000	12121000	person was listening it was hilarious
12121000	12123000	and got to have fun doing it so
12123000	12125000	when internet radio came about it seemed like a real
12125000	12127000	natural progression although to be fair
12127000	12129000	I think without Travis
12129000	12131000	having kind of helped me make that
12131000	12133000	transition he's the host of
12133000	12135000	Under Station Alive I don't know if I would've
12135000	12137000	gotten into internet radio as quickly
12137000	12139000	as I did I think I would've
12139000	12141000	gotten here eventually
12141000	12143000	but I don't think I would've gotten into it
12143000	12145000	as quickly as I did outside of school but if
12145000	12147000	I actually wanted to go way way back and I don't think
12147000	12149000	I've talked about this a lot on the show but way
12149000	12151000	back in high school a friend
12151000	12153000	of mine used to have a public access show we
12153000	12155000	actually did on the local television
12155000	12157000	station so I actually had a TV show for about
12157000	12159000	two years my good
12159000	12161000	friend in high school and I actually produced this show
12161000	12163000	that we did it had nothing to do with video games it was more like a
12163000	12165000	little comedy show that we did just because we could
12165000	12167000	and it was great we got turned
12167000	12169000	on it was great there are very few
12169000	12171000	copies out there in existence and I am
12171000	12173000	very very
12173000	12175000	careful to not let that hit the internet
12175000	12177000	because I just don't want it out there they're all in your
12177000	12179000	mom's garage right ah somewhere
12179000	12181000	yeah my
12181000	12183000	friend Shannon would have copies of every
12183000	12185000	episode somewhere and my
12185000	12187000	mother has them somewhere although I don't know where they
12187000	12189000	are and the tapes probably melted by now and I've
12189000	12191000	YouTube I nope nope
12191000	12193000	that's I will not let them out because I do not
12193000	12195000	want them on YouTube because unfortunately
12195000	12197000	now that I do have this show
12197000	12199000	I think if people were to see that
12199000	12201000	I just it's no
12201000	12203000	and granted it would be a pain
12203000	12205000	in the ass to rip that from
12205000	12207000	video tape right now yeah
12207000	12209000	but unfortunately if it fell in the wrong hands it would
12209000	12211000	be done sooner than I would like it
12211000	12213000	to happen I'm not it's not
12213000	12215000	that I'm necessarily like embarrassed or whatever
12215000	12217000	but it's just you know what it's just not
12217000	12219000	what I do now
12219000	12221000	ah so ah
12221000	12223000	yeah but I did that show and that was a lot of fun and
12223000	12225000	the whole reason I got into that in the first place
12225000	12227000	what I wanted to get to to answer your question
12227000	12229000	ah I had
12229000	12231000	a substitute teacher one day
12231000	12233000	in a physics class and he came in
12233000	12235000	and he was actually trying to do his little like
12235000	12237000	emotional thing like you know because the public access
12237000	12239000	station was kind of hurting for more volunteers
12239000	12241000	and so forth and he was actually showing us a
12241000	12243000	video that he did like a music
12243000	12245000	video and my friend and I looked at each
12245000	12247000	other and thought this is so
12247000	12249000	like
12249000	12251000	ghetto that like if
12251000	12253000	he can do this we can do this
12253000	12255000	and that was honestly what got us
12255000	12257000	into it so we should do public
12257000	12259000	access that'd be hilarious it's so
12259000	12261000	funny to me now to hear when people
12261000	12263000	say man orange
12263000	12265000	launch radio and I've had people say this and it's like the
12265000	12267000	ultimate compliment I can get orange
12267000	12269000	launch radio like got me into doing what I'm
12269000	12271000	doing today because I heard it and I was like
12271000	12273000	I want to do something like that actually
12273000	12275000	actually that is
12275000	12277000	you guys are kind of my inspiration
12277000	12279000	I've listened to you guys since
12279000	12281000	oh my god what was it episode 50
12281000	12283000	back in the old live 365
12283000	12285000	station which I did mention in a
12285000	12287000	beatmania review for KIOS
12287000	12289000	915
12289000	12291000	here in Omaha
12291000	12293000	and I actually mentioned your guys
12293000	12295000	old bemonnie more show
12295000	12297000	awesome because of course I was
12297000	12299000	reviewing beatmania so I figured
12299000	12301000	you know if you like you know the stuff that you
12301000	12303000	hear of the clubs during the rave period
12303000	12305000	or the stuff that you might have heard way back
12305000	12307000	when on orange launch radio bemonnie
12307000	12309000	more show
12309000	12311000	go up this game woohoo
12311000	12313000	well thank you for the plug I appreciate it
12313000	12315000	that is awesome and so
12315000	12317000	but I just hope I'm on KIOS

12321000	12323000	KIOS for Omaha listeners

12337000	12339000	to you that is awesome
12339000	12341000	but I laugh because when people
12341000	12343000	when people tell me that I think
12343000	12345000	back to the video I saw in high school and I go
12345000	12347000	I hope people aren't saying I was inspired by
12347000	12349000	orange launch radio because they thought this show
12349000	12351000	was so terrible and ghetto
12351000	12353000	I can see that
12353000	12355000	but even if that's the reason then more
12355000	12357000	power to you I don't even care
12357000	12359000	I think it's great actually I had somebody tell me to my
12359000	12361000	face that they got into public access
12361000	12363000	because they thought my old TV show
12363000	12365000	they said blah blah blah was so
12365000	12367000	terrible and so awful
12367000	12369000	that you guys really inspired me to do this and I
12369000	12371000	was like oh thank you
12371000	12373000	alright

12431000	12433000	recognize but
12433000	12435000	I'm sure I've heard it I just don't recognize
12435000	12437000	it by the title
12437000	12439000	um yeah so that's it
12439000	12441000	they have some really stupid looking
12441000	12443000	you know how they do those lifestyle
12443000	12445000	shots where they have like someone playing the game
12445000	12447000	and they show like you know
12447000	12449000	what it looks like on screen
12449000	12451000	this guy looks like a douche
12451000	12453000	so I don't know if I want to play this game
12453000	12455000	because I don't want to be that douchey guy
12455000	12457000	I kind of am curious
12457000	12459000	I'm curious just to see what it is
12459000	12461000	I might play it once in a dark room
12461000	12463000	when nobody can see me
12463000	12465000	and then I was going to mention there's a game
12465000	12467000	um called Minitroid
12467000	12469000	that is I don't know if it's out yet
12469000	12471000	or it's possibly being worked on
12471000	12473000	but it's basically a
12473000	12475000	remake or demake of
12475000	12477000	Metroid 2 but it's a
12477000	12479000	browser game and um
12479000	12481000	it's really
12481000	12483000	cute looking it's kind of small
12483000	12485000	but uh
12485000	12487000	I don't think it's been released
12487000	12489000	yet but it is coming
12489000	12491000	alright
12491000	12493000	oh indiegames.com

12499000	12501000	um
12501000	12503000	uh
12503000	12505000	hate it
12505000	12507000	when like I have to find something
12507000	12509000	and it's like four links in
12509000	12511000	it's really annoying
12511000	12513000	well speaking of annoying
12513000	12515000	um I also saw that apparently
12515000	12517000	we're going to be selling some empire
