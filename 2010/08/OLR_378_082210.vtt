00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:08.000
Who's your hosts?

00:08.000 --> 00:12.000
Dark Sakura, Sky, and Loku

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
Tonight, August 22nd, 2010

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
A new drawing tablet is announced for the Wii

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
Goldeneye is set to get Golden Wii accessories

00:22.000 --> 00:26.000
And could a recent PC cult classic be coming to Xbox Live and PSN?

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello my friends on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio

00:36.000 --> 00:42.000
We are that show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle

00:42.000 --> 00:46.000
We like to think of ourselves as the place where every gamer has a voice

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my awesome co-hosts

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
Say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
Yo, what up?

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
How are you doing, Jamie Summers?

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
My head is a nightmare of pain

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
I'm sorry to hear that, you seem to be in a relatively good mood tonight, all things considered

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
Yeah, it's just, it's like, you wanna know, it's not really like a headache

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
It's like being, having sore muscles in my head

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
Interesting, and what else do the voices in your head tell you?

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
Tell me to punch you in the face, no I'm kidding

01:14.000 --> 01:19.000
It tells me that Dan's three bean salad is amazing and you should have some

01:19.000 --> 01:25.000
I may have to a little later, when I'm finished downing these yummy parmesan, garlic, and herb pita chips

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
that I managed to eat the entire bag over the course of a week

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
We should totally take a picture of you modeling them, Rob

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
Perhaps I will in a moment

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
Maybe later, then the whole chat can see my Journey shirt

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
Of course, when Dark Sakura talks about taking pictures, they usually go right to our website

01:38.000 --> 01:42.000
if you don't already know about it, www.orangeloungeradio.com

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
I'm trying to think what else is on orangeloungeradio.com for them to look at

01:45.000 --> 01:50.000
Occasionally a story will be posted, what? That my phone is in the bedroom and I'm too lazy to go get it

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
Well, I guess that segment of the show just got shot, didn't it?

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
No, I'll go get the camera in a minute

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
Canceled due to laziness

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
I'll go get the camera in a minute

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
Which by the way, speaking of which, did you miss us last week everybody?

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
We're back after a week off

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
Last week was cancelled due to gay

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
Yes actually, partially it was

02:07.000 --> 02:11.000
Although I wouldn't say Loki's baby is a part of that

02:11.000 --> 02:15.000
But yeah, I was at a Lady Gaga concert, what? And what?

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
Judge me, I don't care

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
I'm not, because I've had a change of heart

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
We can talk about that later

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
But I want to introduce, because he's back, we've missed him

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
He's been gone for a few weeks, but he is back in the house tonight

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
Say hello to Loki

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
Hello

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
Techmaster Loki, how are you doing?

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
I'm fine

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
Tell us about the baby, we all want to know

02:36.000 --> 02:41.000
He's not doing much, he just pretty much sleeps and poops and eats and that's about it

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
And he's awake every now and then for a few hours

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
But we've been trying to get him to sleep a little bit better at night

02:47.000 --> 02:51.000
He looks like it's kind of funny, at night he doesn't sleep too deeply

02:51.000 --> 02:55.000
And looks like he makes all these arm and leg movements

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
So it looks like he's fighting somebody in his sleep

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
It's kind of funny

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
Hopefully it's not his father

03:02.000 --> 03:06.000
No, he's just like, and kicking his legs up and stuff

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
Interesting

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
Has he resisted the swaddling?

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
He doesn't like to be swaddled, really

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
Neither did Becky's son

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
They always say that babies should be swaddled when they're really young

03:16.000 --> 03:19.000
I've seen more babies than not, just completely hate it

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
It's so weird that everybody has babies now

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
He liked it at first, I think he gets hot

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
He takes after me, so we run really warm

03:27.000 --> 03:35.000
And it's not fun to have a tight blanket on you when you're really hot

03:35.000 --> 03:40.000
There was one picture of him that I have to say, he looked like a little monkey

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
He does look like a little monkey, he also looks like

03:43.000 --> 03:47.000
Oh, what's his name?

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
One of the kids from Malcolm in the Middle

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
Wow

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
Dewey, he looks like Dewey from Malcolm in the Middle

03:55.000 --> 03:59.000
Let's go to our chatroom at chat.orangelaungeradio.com

03:59.000 --> 04:04.000
Where our chatters can chat with us live as we do tape Sunday nights at All Games Radio

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
www.allgames.com is where you can listen to our show live

04:07.000 --> 04:11.000
We do tape 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at All Games Radio

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
But if you want to chat live during the show, you gotta go to a different website

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
chat.orangelaungeradio.com

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
And that's our thing, where every gamer has a voice

04:20.000 --> 04:25.000
You know, yeah, we talk about news, but I'm sure most of you that go to the trouble to download gaming blogs

04:25.000 --> 04:29.000
Or download gaming podcasts probably also read gaming blogs

04:29.000 --> 04:34.000
So I know you get your news from there, but we talk about it with you guys and get some different perspectives

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
But tonight, it's a lot of questions about Loki

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
Toygak says, holy shit, I missed you

04:39.000 --> 04:43.000
I don't know if he's talking about the show in general or Loki or both or what, but there you go

04:43.000 --> 04:47.000
Spazinator says, you were gone? LOLJK

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
DJ Dark Knight says, where's our cigars?

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
I don't know, is that a tradition people still do anymore?

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
I thought after all the whole smoking kills stuff

04:56.000 --> 05:01.000
You know, and they really frown on smoking in general, they don't do the cigars so much anymore

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
I've seen candy cigars, but not the real ones

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
That's dumb

05:05.000 --> 05:09.000
Bobby Black Wolf, the man who does the show before us here at All Games Radio

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
Has a great question, does he appreciate the nursery?

05:12.000 --> 05:17.000
He doesn't really use the nursery yet because he's still sleeping in our room in a little portable crib

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
He will eventually use the nursery

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
No, not yet, he does not appreciate the nursery yet

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
I don't think he can even see the nursery yet

05:26.000 --> 05:30.000
Really only can see about 8 to 12 inches in front of him

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
Because his eyes aren't fully developed yet

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
He can see red though

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
He can see red, there's not much red in that room though

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
But yeah, so he doesn't quite appreciate it yet

05:42.000 --> 05:47.000
Our friends though, their son who's like a year and three months now

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
He loves that room, he just goes in and is like ahhhh

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
And just like, goes crazy

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
So yeah, I'm sure he will appreciate it later on

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
He's just, he's a little young right now

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
Were you here the week we talked about how your pictures got on a gaming blog

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
Or was that the night Josh was born?

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
I think that was the week that Josh was born

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
Yeah, your pictures made it onto what, Game Informer?

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
Some pretty big magazine

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
And we were kind of like laughing because

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
It had nothing to do with the fact that you're here on Orange Launch Radio

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
Which you know, it's fine, nobody listens to the show

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
Except the few faithful folks we've had over the years

06:18.000 --> 06:22.000
But you just cracked me up because they found your photos on Flickr

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
And thought it made for a good story

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
But I think that just goes to show like

06:26.000 --> 06:30.000
Yeah sure, a lot of people may have thought of doing a Mario themed nursery for their babies

06:30.000 --> 06:34.000
But Matt took the full effort with it

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
It went all out

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
I still haven't finished his mobile yet, but

06:38.000 --> 06:42.000
Like I said, I'm not really in a hurry because he's not using his crib yet

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
He's not going to learn to appreciate it for a little while

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
Nah, he doesn't really care about mobiles and stuff like that right now

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
I mean, he's got his swing, has little animals dangling from it

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
He could care less

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
He'll never realize what cool parents he has

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
Doing his room in the video game theme, you know

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
Because like, by the time he's a teenager

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
Well, obviously the room will be changed by the time he's a teenager

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
By the time he's like, you know

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
It's time for that nursery theme to be changed

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
He'll probably be like, man, video games are lame

07:05.000 --> 07:09.000
All my parents, or all my dad does is talk about video games

07:09.000 --> 07:13.000
No, he won't do that

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
I'm just messing

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
Alright, look, he's spoiled because he'll be like

07:17.000 --> 07:21.000
Oh, and they're like, oh man, I really wish I had like a Wii 2 or something

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
Be like, ah, I already got that

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
I bought that for myself

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
But hey, you can use it if you want, you know

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
He'll never get to play them because his dad will always be using it

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
He's like, hey, I want to play this game, got it for you

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
Alright, we got to introduce somebody else here in the studio

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
Because he's been so good and patient

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
Sitting there for like seven minutes

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
While we've been doing the intro to the show

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
But he's here in studio, and you've heard him before

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
He's here, it's Alan, also known as Salacious Pop

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
Is joining us in the studio tonight

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
Hello everyone

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
Oh, what a weekend I've had

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
I'm hanging in there

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
Tell us about it, because your weekend and my weekend were very similar

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
Yes, we had a road trip up to Reno

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
Because the Rocky Horror Troop that Rob is a part of

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
Was doing a Rocky Horror performance

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
For about

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
3, 500 people we think

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
The number is still debated

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
Like, I've heard everywhere from 2,000

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
To 6,800

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
And they do it in an arena

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
It's definitely the largest showing they do regularly

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
In the country

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
I think there was once a large, large, large show in LA

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
But, I mean, this is the largest regular show they do

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
Where it's literally thousands of people

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
And honestly, at that point

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
2,500, 6,800

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
Looks all the same to me

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
It's a lot of fun

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
So, I'd never been to Reno before

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
So I was really excited to

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
Go gamble a little bit

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
And I came down

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
With food poisoning

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
And was sick as a dog

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
For a day and a half

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
While we were up there

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
I know, and I was worried that you were going to get

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
That whole associated response thing with Reno

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
So the next time I said, hey, let's go to Reno

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
You'd just think about, like, barfing

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
And you'd be like, no, I don't want to go

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
I started to feel kind of

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
Fluish and crappy during the car ride up

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
And I'm like, alright, 3 hour car ride, change in elevation

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
I just feel kind of icky

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
Hit the buffet, no, my stomach was like

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
That was a bad plan

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
That was your first mistake

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
You didn't condition yourself with enough junk food

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
Beforehand, see

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
You can't go to

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
Really anywhere in Nevada

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
And not have a buffet at some point

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
Unless you live there

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
I'm sure we have plenty of listeners in Las Vegas

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
Going, ugh, I'm sick of fucking

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
Hearing about buffets

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
They suck, they're terrible

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
They can shut up because they have Krispy Kreme

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
And Krispy Kreme is awesome

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
And I wish we still had it here

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
Instead of it's going to be what

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
What were they turning into, a Chick-fil-A?

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
A Panera bread

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
A Panera, screw it

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
Put it back to being

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
A Krispy Kreme again

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
I didn't care less about Panera

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
That building's been empty for like 3 years

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
It's been a very long time

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
It's longer than 3 years

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
Finally they're putting a Panera bread in there

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
I like Panera bread, I think they're a really good

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
Healthy place to eat

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
I don't like them because they're egg sandwiches

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
They don't scramble their eggs

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
They just kind of fry it

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
And then you get chunks of

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
If it's egg salad, it shouldn't be

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
Did you say egg or egg salad?

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
No, they're breakfast sandwiches with eggs on them

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
By the way, once in a while

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
We do stop talking about food and start talking about video games

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
Just once you know it's not a Food Network podcast

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
It's a game podcast

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
If they had scrambled their eggs, it'd be

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
An even distribution between the yolk and the white

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
And the problem is, when you fry it like that

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
You get these big chunks of yolk

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
And it doesn't taste very good

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
Plus they don't season anything

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
And it's terrible

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
Really wish it was a Krispy Kreme again

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
Next time, if you really want

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
One of these nights, when I come back from the Bay Area

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
I'll have to do it when Jamie's not looking

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
Because she'll be mad

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
That's awesome

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
From the Bay Area, because they still have them there

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
You know what, I want

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
One Krispy Kreme in particular

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
Which one?

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
So you say the Cheesecake Donut

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
As much as I like them

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
My favorite to this day is

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
Still the Eclair

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
Because I do love the custard

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
I might have to think about doing that

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
Is there one on the way home for me?

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
I think there is

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
You should just take me to the Bay Area

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
Would you just take you?

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
Just take me there

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
There's one near me in Daly City

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
I don't know where you would stay for the night

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
I mean, you can't sleep in the bed with

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
What?

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
Okay, you're gonna lonely roam the streets

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
Alright, anyhow

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
I'll be driving around singing Journey songs

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
Act F in our chatroom says

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
It isn't OLR without Orange Lounge Foodie-O

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
Don't you know it

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
Monty Boggs says

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
I click off once they stop talking about food

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
They would be heaven

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
I'm sure there is a donut buffet somewhere

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
There's gotta be

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
That would be kind of dangerous

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
Now I've heard about this thing

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
I'm just perpetuating the food thing

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
I've heard about this thing now where they're making hamburgers

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
Out of Krispy Kreme donuts

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
The Luther

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
There's a name for these?

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
It's because they figured out that website

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
ThisIsWhyYoureFat.com

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
And people are like

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
That's really bad for you

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
And then we get publication

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
Because people talk about it

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
And how crazy it is

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
It's ridiculous

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
It's a trend that I wish would go away

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
There was an episode of the Boondocks

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
On Cartoon Network

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
Specifically about the grandpa opening up a soul food restaurant

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
With the Luther

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
Wow

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
It seems like one of those foods

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
You get at the State Fair

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
The State Fair is the home of

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
Terribly bad for you food

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
I'll just make a deep fried hamburger

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
I don't know

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
Take the whole hamburger

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
You've had a Monte Cristo before

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
Is that what they call it?

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
Yeah

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
I tried to get Rob to order one

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
Even when he described it

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
It was a deep fried ham and cheese sandwich

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
It's thick sourdough toast

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
With ham and Swiss

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
And then it's dipped in a sweet batter

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
Deep fried

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
And then served with strawberry jam and powdered sugar

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
It's ham and cheese

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
French toast with crap on it

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
There's a lot of things I don't like about that

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
I don't like crap on my French toast

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
Other than maybe powdered sugar

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
And I really don't like powdered sugar if I can get it without it

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
I don't really care for jams

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
And jellies and stuff like that

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
And also I hate Swiss

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
He's quite a picky eater

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
I am a picky eater

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
Swiss is one of the lowest sodium cheeses

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
Also random

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
I saw that on the menu

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
Of course there are still Bennigan's

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
What they need to do is they need to take a burger

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
Bread it in the pub

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
Is that what it's called?

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
I don't know what Bennigan's is

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
I've seen it

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
I've never been there

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
Didn't we go at California Extreme?

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
No we went to IHOP

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
No we went to Bennigan's and then IHOP

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
You guys went to Bennigan's during the day

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
Dan and I showed up later

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
We went to Bennigan's

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
I'm sorry I'm distracted

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
I'm trying to get into how is your gaming week

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
But I have to ask Darsakra

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
She likes to surf the web during this show

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
She's on Facebook right now looking at pictures of Carol Channing

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
What?

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
The company that I work at

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
That I'm about to get laid off of

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
I found my boss's Facebook page

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
My first boss who hired me

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
And I'm looking at his photos of him

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
He was Carol Channing?

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
You were hired by Carol Channing?

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
Do you like raspberries?

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
Hired!

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
But he's the world's biggest Ann-Margret fan

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
And he's also

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
He's gone to her house

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
Got tons of photos

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
He and his partner

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
Have met

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
Her and her husband

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
And gone to shows

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
And sat in box seats

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
But I'm also looking at his other photos

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
Of other celebrities that he's met

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
And there's like him and Carol Channing

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
And Bo Derek and that's pretty cool

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
He's gonna be really sad in about 10 years

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
Wish I had pictures

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
With all the celebrities I've met

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
I have a picture

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
With um

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
My rock star hero

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
Mr. Castlevania himself

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
Good times

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
Yeah, with his wild hair

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
And him being taller than me

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
And looking absolutely like he was gonna pee himself

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
When I asked him in Japanese if I could have a photo

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
You were there for that

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
I was, I think I took the photo

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
Yes you did

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
And since Dark Sakura brought up Castlevania

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
I'll use it as a segue to finally talk about games

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
So Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
Or two weeks if you wish

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
I really didn't play much of anything

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
I played a little pinball

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
And mostly I watched Dan scream

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
At his Nintendo emulator

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
Well today I watched him yell

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
At Rad Racer

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
But I wanted to hear the music

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
And the doo doo doo doo doo doo doo

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
The one that was used in the

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
The Strong Bad

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
Anime one

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
Anyway

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
Then Dan played some Turbo Out Run

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
And Out Runners

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
It was old school racing to hear it

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
Fuck it and turn it off

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
And

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
I found my Ninja Pass

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
But I couldn't find my SD

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
My micro SD card

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
I think those are pretty cheap to come by

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
Yeah, I ordered one for five bucks

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
But the whole reason I wanted it

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
Is because since I'm going back to the gym

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
My favorite thing to do is to go

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
Well, back in the day it was go on the elliptical

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
And play Pokemans

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
So now it's gonna be

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
I guess play whatever

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
Game I happen to have on me

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
And I wanted to find some of those

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
SNES ROM conversions

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
For the DSI

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
Nice

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
And then I can play lots and lots of Seiken 3

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
Because that's been the game

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
I've really been wanting to get into

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
Or just Final Fantasy 6, 3, whatever you want

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
I have a new game that I'm going to be playing

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
Thank you to a lack of forgetfulness

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
Finally, after like a month

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
I finally remember to bring Dark Sakura

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
Final Fantasy 13

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
Yeah, I really should finish that game

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
I'll be playing the crap out of this

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
And I start school next week too

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
Good times, you're gonna be busy

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
And Tuesday is old school DDR night

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
At Arviggle

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
Yes, I'm gonna go

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
I don't know if I'll actually play Ditter

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
But I'll definitely play some 2DX

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
And if they ever

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
Fix their frickin' Technica machine

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
I'll play that too

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
Alright

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
Maybe I'll play like

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
One round of DDR

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
That would be fun, I haven't done that forever

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
But I'm almost afraid to try again

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
Just because last time

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
That's cause I still think

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
It's humbling, you're gonna have to

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
Go down to 5 footers to like get yourself

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
Back into it

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
I've been playing 6's and 7's and it's been

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
Fun for me

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
It's humbling, cause you'll be all like

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
What was that one song, it's like a 9 footer

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
It's really fast, the heavenly something

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
Angelic mix

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
Oh, Healing Vision Angelic mix, that's it right?

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
It's one of those really fast

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
Songs that you dance to in DDR

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
And it's like super fast 9 footer

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
Back when I was in my younger

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
20's when DDR first came out

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
Or I guess when Max first came out

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
I was able to pass that song after a little bit of practice

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
But it didn't almost give me

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
Like a heart attack like it did when I tried it

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
I couldn't even finish it

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
It's insane. Well you remember back in the day

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
I could play tons of stuff

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
And now, but this is

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
How I look at it is

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
I've got those shiny

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
Sort of old

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
Dance pads I picked up at the thrift store

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
I'm gonna start playing again

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
I've had no

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
There's no excuse for me to have

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
Just not done it

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
I am really curious about this DDR

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
I need to bring this up at some point

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
Because I don't think it's in the show or otherwise

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
They had the Dance Dance Revolution preview

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
Party this past week

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
None of us went, but my buddy Mel

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
Who you guys all know Mel B

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
If you've been listening to the show long enough

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
He's been on before, he went

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
The pictures looked fun

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
Think DJ Tyrant who does sometimes an article

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
Or here or there for our website, he went too

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
And they said, well dance

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
Masters was clearly

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
The game to play there

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
That was a lot of fun

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
But the DDR for the PS3

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
Eh, the move stuff is kind of gimmicky

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
But otherwise, it's a pretty decent

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
DDR game and the song list looks

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
Really cool, like it's got a lot of really good songs

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
In it I gotta say

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
I liked the machine they had there

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
Yeah, there's a new X2 is now coming out

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
He said that was a sweet song list

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
And they fixed the dance pads, they're not so crappy anymore

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
Because X had really bad dance pads

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
They got DDRX at Dave and Buster's in town

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
I had to laugh

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
Sorry to interrupt

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
Because you mentioned Mel B

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
I had to laugh because I've been seeing this on my release list

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
And I finally found the box art for it

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
They have a game coming out in the week called

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
Get Fit with Mel B

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
Apparently there's a woman named Mel B

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
It's Scary Spice

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
That's who that is

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
That's Scary Spice, Mel B

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
Sorry

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
Go power blah blah blah

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
I'm Mel B

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
I'm the runner up on Dancing with the Stars

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
On the internet, doesn't know who I am

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
At any rate

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
Dan and I are having our fifth wedding anniversary

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
Oh

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
And we were gonna

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
Get folks together on the day before

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
Because we can't do the $40

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
Free play thing all day thing

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
On our actual anniversary

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
So we were gonna go and

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
Hit up Dave and Buster's and have like a big party

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
With whoever wants to show up

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
What day is this?

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
31st

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
It'll be August 31st

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
I should be here

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
And the first is our actual fifth year anniversary

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
And the second is when my conversion goes through

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
Oh wow

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
When do you do the whole um

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
The dip on the second

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
Oh wow

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
Fun dip

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
Good times

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
And then I will be shiny and new

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
And then you are officially

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
Yes

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
One of the chosen people at that point right?

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
One of the chosen people

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
Congrats in advance

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
Well somehow we completely deviated

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
From the talk of video games

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
What did we hit on in there?

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
Jews, Spice Girls

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
No but anyway

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
Loki

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
I haven't been playing a whole lot

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
You got a good excuse

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
I'm trying to think back to what I played at the hospital

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
On the DS

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
I don't even know if I played anything on the DS

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
I played a little bit more of

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
Spirit Tracks

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
That game is okay

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
I just

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
Some of the Zelda games on the DS

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
I just don't go through them very quickly

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
But it's alright

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
Then mainly

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
The only thing I've been playing since I got back to work

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
Has been

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
The Grand Theft Auto Lost and Damned

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
Yes we've gone back to Lost and Damned now

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
Because they were kind of craving

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
The open world Grand Theft Auto

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
Deathmatch things

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
And since you can't really do that

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
In the Battle of the Gay Tony

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
We're playing Lost and Damned

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
It's actually a little bit more fun

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
It's a little less serious

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
Because I'm not really trying to get up on the leaderboards

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
For that

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
I kind of want to go back to the Battle of the Gay Tony

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
So I can actually get to the top of the leaderboards

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
Because I kind of stopped at rank 59

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
But then on top of all that

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
I've been working still on

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
Working on my mods and stuff

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
For Grand Theft Auto

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
Because I have a really big one in the works

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
Right now that's going to be

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
Completely

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
Stuff that's never been done before

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
On the console version

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
And thankfully I

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
Upgraded my computer to Windows

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
7 64 bit

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
And added another 4 gigs of RAM

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
So now it runs smoothly

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
And I can actually run Grand Theft Auto

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
After having it crash after 5 minutes

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
There was something weird with the installation

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
Or something on XP

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
So now it's really stable

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
Which is great and I can actually work on it

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
Lots of baby jokes in the chatroom

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
Spaznator wants to know if you've been playing Babymaker Extreme

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
No

23:09.000 --> 23:13.000
Frisbee says Loki has been playing lots of Imagine Babies

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
No

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
It's just

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
Just been playing reality babies

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
Just been playing washing the bottles

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
Changing the diapers

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
Good times

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
Fun stuff like that

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
Because now

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
With the sleep schedule and everything

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
We have to get up a lot of times

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
I kind of have to stick to the old person schedule

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
Where I have to go to bed at 9 o'clock

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
At night

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
Well it's been 11

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
11 o'clock at night is really what we've been sticking to

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
But sometimes 9 o'clock at night

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
Or 10

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
Between 9 and 11

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
Because I have to get up in the morning like at 5 in the morning

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
You know with the babies

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
So

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
That's how long it takes me to wake up

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
Is about 2 hours with the baby and stuff

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
And also on the weekends

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
I wake up early with the baby

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
To try to take him out of the room

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
So if he's fussing

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
Nelly can sleep some

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
With all that and having to change him

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
And do stuff every 3 hours

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
It really doesn't give me a lot of time to work on anything

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
So

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
Gameplay and stuff

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
I have a lot of stuff to play

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
Including a lot of things I really shouldn't be playing

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
I don't think anyone is surprised

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
That you haven't been able to play

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
A whole lot lately

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
We'll get into things I shouldn't be playing right

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
A little bit later

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
And then

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
Yeah just lots of stuff to

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
To be doing

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
But I've been mainly just working on the Grand Theft Auto stuff

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
Because that's what I play at work

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
And it's going to be so fun

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
When I mod things done

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
DarkSakura

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
You missed something you want to talk about in your week?

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
I played Star Trek Online

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
Of course you always do. Anything exciting going on there?

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
Dabo! The implemented Dabo

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
So you can gamble for Latinum

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
And they have Hololita

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
And they got Chase Masterson to do her voice

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
Wow

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
Lots of stuff in that game keeps growing over there

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
Good times

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
Alan! How you doing? How was your gaming week?

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
Pretty uneventful

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
I played the

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
Castlevania Harmony of

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
Schadenfreude or whatever the 360 version is

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
No I'm joking about the name

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
The multiplayer one

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
I played the demo of that, didn't like it

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
Don't know why

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
Playing as Alucard, upscaled HD graphics

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
Castlevania

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
Gave it two rounds

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
It's weird

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
It doesn't feel like other Castlevania games

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
I hear that the game really shines on its best

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
When it's multiplayer

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
No big surprise, most games are better

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
When it's multiplayer

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
Playing it normal is really strange

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
Especially the way the whole map

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
Is zoomed out in the beginning

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
Is just kind of a weird

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
Weird feeling

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
Some puzzle quests too, still working on that

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
Can only play that

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
For maybe 30-45 minutes

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
At a time because

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
When you get to the lower levels

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
I'm almost at the max level

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
I'm level 43 out of 50

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
I get to play so much freaking Bejeweled

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
Just to clear a room, it kind of becomes a grind

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
And of course World of Warcraft

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
Got some accomplishments

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
Done in that

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
What are your biggest accomplishments in World of Warcraft so far?

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
50 mounts

26:23.000 --> 26:29.000
And I finally grinded all five cities in Argent Tournament

26:29.000 --> 26:33.000
So I got my super hella exalted Argent champion

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
With cheesecake achievement

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
Does Blizzard actually mail you a cheesecake?

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
I hope so

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
Because all those dailies, never again

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
I wanted to die

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
Man, I would so play an MMO

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
If they sent you things in real life

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
For doing all the grinding

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
I mean you're paying $14.95 a month

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
Just to send a little cheap

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
Can you imagine if you're suddenly in the mail one day

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
Congratulations on your uber mount, here's a cheesecake

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
I want to play S.T.O. and have them send me

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
Romulan ale or a warp core breach

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
That would be a great idea

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
Davo, you win liquor

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
But you know there'd be people that would exploit the hell out of that

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
So they'd have to think of funny ways to put caps on it

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
But it's kind of like one of those loyalty programs

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
Like what, Square Enix sends out what

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
Like iPhones or no, iPod Touches or whatever

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
If you're like an uber platinum

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
Bought every game we ever put out member or whatever

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
But yeah

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
Anyhow

27:23.000 --> 27:27.000
And our guild is now 6-12 of ICC

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
Same guild I'm in of course

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
We got down Rotface and

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
Festergut

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
And we're working on Valtheria

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
Dreamwalker, Healy, Dragon

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
Which probably was not the best idea for the next boss

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
Which I don't like that fight at all

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
So I don't know, we're going back in tomorrow

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
So maybe we'll do the Blood Princes

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
Is that what it is? The Blood Queen, the Princes

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
Princes and then Queen is after them

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
Yeah we gotta do that whole thing

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
Wow wow wow

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
I've been playing a lot of WoW 2 of course

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
All the same things he's been talking about

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
Well actually no cause my accomplishments I don't have nearly the same stuff

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
I haven't done the uber stuff

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
Alan's really good at focusing on one character

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
And I've got, I've started to develop

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
You know as the weight continues on

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
For Cataclysm, Ultihallism

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
And you know I've been leveling

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
A shaman which has been fun

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
And been slowly

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
Working on my warrior

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
Who was lulled at like 76 for the past

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
Like 4 months, she's up to like 78 now

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
So I'll probably get her over the hill

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
To 80 at some point then I'll have another 80

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
Outside of that though

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
Another Blizzard game I've been playing a lot of

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
I finally played

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
Starcraft 2

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
Which is old news

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
To a lot of you guys you know

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
Those of you that are huge fans of Starcraft

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
Bought this game the day it came out I'm sure

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
But you might remember I was very apprehensive

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
About getting into Starcraft because

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
The RTS thing I find to be very

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
Overwhelming especially when I see screenshots

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
For the game I'm like there's so much shit on the screen

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
How are you supposed to be able to manage all that

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
I don't understand this is too complicated

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
My feeble brain can't handle this

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
Of course I mentioned a couple weeks on the show

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
I came to the realization that my ex-boyfriend

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
Used to play Starcraft and he really

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
Enjoyed it and was a big fan of it and I'm thinking

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
If that asshole can play then so can I

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
So I finally said you know what

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
I'm going to just suck it up and get Starcraft 2

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
Because I have a lot of friends that play I'll figure it out

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
And I've been having a good time with it

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
It's actually

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
Quite a bit of fun and it's not nearly as bad

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
As I thought it would be for learning

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
At least in the campaign

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
The campaign very clever

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
In the way it does it it works into the story

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
Where like the first mission you don't even

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
Build structures you're just kind of walking around

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
And learning how to engage in combat

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
And walk around second mission

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
Okay now you're building structures and they

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
Add little bits and pieces at a time

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
Into this so the campaign is really cool

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
The way it's developed

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
Multiplayer

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
Not so noob friendly

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
I mean they've done some things

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
There's this whole practice league you can do

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
For a little while you can slow down the game

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
A lot I mean there are some things they've done

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
To help it be a little bit easier but

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
You know at the end of the day when you try to play

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
A human opponent it's it's it's tough

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
And

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
Playing though against like the computer AI

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
Depending on how you do it is

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
Is cool like you know

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
A friend of mine from the WoW guild and I were playing

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
Online the other night and we were playing

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
Two versus two but we would slow down

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
The game and we played very

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
Easy computer and it was almost too easy

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
Like we whooped it like three times so we

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
Said let's step it up to easy

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
And still we were able to conquer it

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
You know a little more difficult but not not too bad

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
So but then we played

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
Like instead of a custom game

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
We actually played the regular co-op

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
Mode that was like I don't know

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
Some different mode where you couldn't change

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
The speed so the speed was

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
Fast and we got annihilated

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
We got zerg literally

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
By because both computer opponents

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
Happened to be zerg and we just got slaughtered

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
And it was really hard so

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
As long as I can play the game slow

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
I'm good and then or getting better

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
I should say and I know the

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
Speed thing will come with time but

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
Yeah so multiplayer has been a very interesting

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
Experience but campaign is really cool

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
You know very animated very cool

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
Little like decks that you go through on the ship

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
To kind of well you're not

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
You don't start there you actually start in a

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
Different area but you move on to the ship

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
And you can kind of buy enhancements

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
And things which are really cool

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
So I like what they did there

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
Where things get weird I think with starcraft

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
Is that they made this

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
Decision to put out three starcraft

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
Games and they're gonna do I think the zerg game

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
Is coming next and there's gonna be a protoss game

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
Later on there what all

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
Within the next year year and a half maybe

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
I don't remember how far apart these games are supposed to be

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
But they're all coming out and my question is

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
You know for 60 bucks

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
For this game I feel like I got

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
A pretty good deal there's a really

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
Well fleshed out multiplayer game

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
There's a solid single player game in there

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
I'm a happy camper

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
But my question is in the next game

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
Okay there's gonna be

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
A zerg campaign alright I get that

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
That'll be cool cause I'll actually get to learn how to play

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
Zerg cause that's the other

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
Problem I have with multiplayer right now is that

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
Being that I am new to starcraft I didn't really

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
Get into the first game

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
I don't know what I'm doing when I play

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
Zerg or protoss I mean yeah I know

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
They have a lot of the similar stuff but I don't

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
I don't know it and there's no real easy

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
Way to learn it so

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
I guess these other games might be an easy way

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
For me to learn it but for everybody else

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
That's super into starcraft

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
I don't know how they're gonna justify 60 dollars

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
Just for a zerg campaign

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
Doesn't seem like

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
There's gonna be enough there I mean

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
I'm imagining they'll just have to do a shit ton

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
Of maps and some other enhancements

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
To multiplayer here and there

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
Achievements I don't know but 60 dollars

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
Is really gonna feel

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
Like you're not getting the same

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
Value out of the second game

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
So you do the first game and maybe

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
Obviously it's probably a little early for me

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
To be saying something like that cause I haven't played

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
The second game but I just kinda look at it

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
And go what are they gonna add that's gonna

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
Make it worth all that money cause multiplayer

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
Is multi you know that's I don't see that changing

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
A whole lot

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
I wanna

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
I think I recall the blizzard developers saying

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
Last year that when they announced that they were

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
Doing three separate releases

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
That the campaigns the story modes for each

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
Game is gonna be anywhere from

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
25 to 40 hours whatever is

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
Considered a full game length

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
Cause in Starcraft 1

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
All three campaigns together made up the game

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
So you're gonna be playing as the Terrans for

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
30 hours to get their whole story

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
Zerg for 30 hours to get their whole campaign

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
So I guess they're really it's more like a trilogy

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
I guess in one

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
Sequel but it's still gonna be really hard

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
After having plopped the money and

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
Feeling that value from this first

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
Game when I get that second game

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
If I don't feel that same value

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
I'm not gonna be pleased

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
If you don't care about lore really

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
And you're just in it for the multiplayer and the maps

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
Which a lot of people are

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
30 hours of campaign even if it's like ooh let's

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
You know go into the heart of the politics of the Zerg

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
It's like yeah I don't care

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
That's 30 hours I could be working on my ranking in league mode

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
Right? Yeah

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
So it's gonna be very interesting to see how they justify it

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
I think it's gonna be tough

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
But you know I don't know Blizzard

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
Clearly they know what they're doing

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
They have much success on the PC

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
You know I'm really excited for Diablo 3

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
And obviously the new WoW expansion

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
But at this point

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
I kind of look at it and go

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
I don't know if this was the best decision

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
I mean from a money making perspective

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
It was but

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
They might do 60 bucks, 45 bucks, 45 bucks

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
They might take it down a notch

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
On the prize for the latter two

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
I wonder if they're gonna do the other two as expansions

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
To the first one so you have to buy the first game

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
Ho ho

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
Wow

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
I could see that

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
If the second and third games were just expansions

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
To the first game

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
That I get but that's not the way Blizzard's talking

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
So I don't know

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
Alright anyhow

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
We're gonna get into some gaming news here

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
Now that we're done with our gaming week

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
But first some housekeeping

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
Not a whole lot of housekeeping I want to share tonight actually

A little later in the show

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
Otherwise not a lot of show

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
I mean we had last week off I don't see us having another show

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
Off until

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
Probably I know Halloween

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
Is on a Sunday this year right so there probably

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
Is not gonna be an alarm

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
I sent you a message about that

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
You did but I think it was when I was really intoxicated in Reno

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
That's something to discuss later

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
Yes how I

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
Drank so much in Reno that I actually fell out of the bed

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
Oh no I meant Halloween but

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
Oh uh

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
I just made that up

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
It's really funny huh

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
Rob fell out of the bed

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
Alright yeah we'll talk Halloween later

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
But otherwise we're set for a little while

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
Alright uh or

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
I don't know about Labor Day weekend

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
Because that's gonna be tough cause it's a three day weekend

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
We'll see

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
Drunk show?

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
It's gonna be an idea actually

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
We haven't done that in a long long time

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
No we haven't

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
I doubt Loki would be participating in that

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
Yeah I don't think I could

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
Does Dan drink at all? Can Dan drink?

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
He's not big on it

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
You know what we should do

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
We should do the marathon episode of Orange Lounge Radio

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
Yes

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
Cause there's nothing on

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
On All Games Radio after us

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
And we should just honestly see

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
And I don't know how the listeners will feel about this

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
We should do the regular show

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
And then we just go for it

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
Go as long as we possibly can

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
I wonder if there's a Guinness Book of World Records

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
For the world's longest podcast

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
We wouldn't hit it

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
Because I know some of these people

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
Especially when they do the charity bus

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
The desert bus

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
That thing goes on for like a week

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
But I'm talking about podcast

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
Even then I don't think we'd hit it in just 24 hours

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
We'd have to take it two weeks time

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
We'll add gaming podcast

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
In front of that

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
The longest episode of the official gaming podcast

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
Of the universe

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
I'm looking at the chatroom

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
Chat.orangeloungeradio.com

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
Breakman in our chatroom

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
Just for the record says falling out of the bed

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
Is way better than falling off the toilet

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
Haven't done that

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
Let's see

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
The chatroom says ooh drunk show

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
And of course as always we would drink responsibly

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
If we do have a drunk show then somebody else

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
Is gonna have to drive me here

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
On the vault floor like Jamie's other

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
Houseguests do

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
We'll figure that out

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
Tigerclaw says it'll be like an after birth XXL

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
Yeah something like that

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
Sj100matt says we should invite

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
Irene and Xtopher for this

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
We definitely should try to get other people here

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
If we do that

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
Maybe I'm onto something

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
I'm not going out of town for Labor Day

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
I usually do but I'm not this year

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
That's actually in two weeks

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
I plan on sitting on my ass

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
Are you available to come up here?

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
I was gonna say if you're staying at home

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
For Labor Day weekend I'm coming up here then

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
Maybe we'll do that

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
If people feel like crashing

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
So we can sleep in cycles

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
We've got the futile mattresses

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
In the vault

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
I can make it into a comfortable little bed

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
We have comfortable couches

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
We'll figure something out

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
That's in two weeks though

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
I just realized oh crap that's in two weeks

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
So next week we'll have an answer

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
On what's gonna happen in two weeks

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
Alright in the meantime

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
How about some actual bonafide gaming news

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
Loki I know you've missed the gaming news

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
How are you doing?

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
Doing alright

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
So there's a rumor going around saying that the brand new

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
Or I guess the next iteration

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
Of the PSP will have touch sensitive

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
Controls on the back of the system

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
Now this isn't that far fetched

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
Of an idea because if you've

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
Seen any of the

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
Shots of the PSP

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
On the phone that's supposed to be coming out

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
It actually has some sort of touch panels

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
On the front of the unit

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
I don't understand the back how that's really gonna

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
Work it seems a little awkward to me

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
But I guess we'll see

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
Um

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
And apparently this is coming from

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
An unnamed source according

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
To Eurogamer and

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
Um

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
There's not really

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
Much to go on I guess other than

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
Saying that um

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
Apparently the device is gonna

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
Be roughly the size of the PSP 3000

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
And um

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
That looks like there's gonna be plenty

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
Of room left over for

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
A physical media slot

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
On it so

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
None of this PSP go crap

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
Cause honestly that didn't sell very well at all

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
I think they were super flimsy

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
Yeah

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
Guess what Sony apparently people do like to buy

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
Physical copies of their games

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
Who would have thought

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
Um

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
So

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
I don't know it'd be interesting to see

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
If this really does anything

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
I think they really should just stick with

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
Putting at least a second analog stick on there

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
Um cause the actual PSP

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
Phone thing um had

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
This touch panel that would kind of replace

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
The analog sticks

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
And you could kind of use it like the analog sticks

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
Cause it was almost like a strip

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
Um which is an interesting idea I guess

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
But

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
I don't know

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
Hopefully the system will do a lot better than the

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
Last PSP so

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
I don't think the last PSP oh well the PSP Go

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
Did terribly yes but the original

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
You're not talking about the original PSP

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
I'm talking about the original PSP it's not done well recently

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
Well compared to the DS but it's done

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
Better than a lot of systems do

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
I would think

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
What other systems are we talking about out there?

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
The Lynx, the Game Gear, the

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
Gamescom, the uh

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
What was that shitty little thing they showed off at E3

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
A few years ago it was a portable device

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
The Gizmodo? The Gizmodo

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
The N-Gage, it's been better than all of those

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
I like the little

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
Guitar game on the Gizmodo though

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
Barely though Gizmondo that was it

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
Gizmondo

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
Oh Gizmodo's a gaming block

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
Or something like that

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
It's a dumb name for device anyways

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
Gizmondo

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
But yeah it's just I don't know

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
I don't see them doing too much

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
Stuff that's very different than the last

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
PSP I think that

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
The system's okay

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
They just have to make a few enhancements to it

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
And hopefully they'll learn from their mistakes

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
Um

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
And I hope for their sake that it's a little more

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
Secure as far as cracking it goes

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
No

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
Wait what adds value

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
To these rumors? Cause rumors

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
Can you know kinda come from anywhere

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
Like I could say oh the next PSP is gonna double as a

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
Cigarette lighter woohoo you know there you go

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
But uh

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
Cut, print, run with it

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
PSP to have cigarette lighter

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
But what adds this any value

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
What they're saying here

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
Um

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
Honestly don't know

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
So I guess we don't really know

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
I mean for all we know this could be

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
Some sort of

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
Analyst talking about the system

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
I don't know

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
Let's see here

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
It's um

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
According to three separate development sources

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
That have seen the new PSP

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
And

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
They're saying that it's gonna

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
Have a touch sensitive area on the back of the

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
Unit behind the screen

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
Which is weird if you think

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
About it I mean

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
That's just awkward

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
I mean if I'm gonna control a game and I'm

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
Touch screens on the back

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
Unless it like flips

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
Over or something so you can do like

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
Touch screen type games like the DS or something

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
But

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
I don't know

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
Going to our chatroom at chat.orangelandraday.com

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
Odd1 says I hope they keep the online

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
Functionality of the device, podcasting

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
Decent web browsing, shit was

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
Kind of cash you know and SD cards

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
Yeah um I kind of agree

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
PSP's biggest strength wasn't necessarily

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
The games that were on it but the fact it was kind of an all

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
In one type of thing I mean minus the phone

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
But you don't need a phone there

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
They added their advantage definitely

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
There but and the games were

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
Not bad I mean the games were good

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
It's just for whatever reason

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
Well I know what the reason is

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
You know they have rampant piracy

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
And I'm sure that's affected their

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
Sales of different games

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
And because of that now you don't have a lot of games being

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
Developed for the PSP just because it's not

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
Doing as well

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
I don't think it was a

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
Terrible system at all but

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
There's a few things that they could have fixed

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
Like you know the second analog stick would have been

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
Nice

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
Definitely think it should have at least two analog sticks

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
And then as far as the controls

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
Go I think it's fine maybe add

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
Some you know an L2 R2

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
Button you know so it's more like

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
The Playstation

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
And that's about it that's all you really need

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
To do as far as controls go because the controls

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
You know scheme

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
Is pretty much the same thing that's on the

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
Playstation 3 and the Xbox 360

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
And it works well you don't need to

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
Add some touch screens to it

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
Hell if you want to make the screen a touch screen or something

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
That's fine you know so you can type and stuff

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
It's a lot easier than you know the

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
Phone dialing type thing that they had

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
Going with it

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
That would be fine if you just

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
Make the screen a touch screen for that kind of stuff

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
Because people dig that

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
And if you want the control scheme you know for

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
Different like casual games

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
That would be fine

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
But I don't think they really need to reinvent

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
You know the controls for the system

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
Itself it's pretty good

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
Alright

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
Well we'll see what happens I would imagine if there

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
Was going to be a new PSP probably not going to hear anything

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
About it until next year's E3

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
They're saying it's expected to launch

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
At the end of 2011

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
Makes sense because you have the 3DS coming out

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
At the beginning of 2011 so

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
We'll see what happens maybe it'll do 3D

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
On top of all that doubt it

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
We'll see

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
By the way before I get into my next story I did want to bring

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
This up because somebody in chat had actually talked about

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
Let's see it was a little while ago here

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
But talking about the gaming marathon

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
Or the marathon we were talking about doing over Labor Day weekend

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
Tiger Con or chat room says

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
Seems like a good idea for those of us in the west coast

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
Or for those in the west coast

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
But for the east coast it would be enormously late for us

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
I actually got

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
A message right after that from

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
Bobby Blackwolf who does the show

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
Before us telling us he's actually going to be out

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
Labor Day weekend so that means

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
There's going to be no programming on all games radio

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
At all on Sunday because Dragon Con

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
Is that same weekend and PAX

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
So we'd only be going up against PAX

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
And Dragon Con

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
Just that?

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
I think there's a lot of people

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
Listening to our show though that aren't able to afford

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
To fly out to Seattle or Atlanta

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
So I'm sure there'll be an audience

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
For it if we want to do it

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
So we'll see

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
We'll have to see what happens

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
I have to make sure it's okay that we can

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
Just hijack the stream for a whole day

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
But I don't see why not

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
I think more people would rather hear the talking

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
Than the music but maybe it's just me

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
Anyway we'll let you know next week

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
As we move on talking about some more gaming news

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
And GoldenEye is happening on

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
Of course the Wii coming out a little later

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
This year

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
Except it's GoldenEye with Daniel Craig

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
Which is a little weird but you know it is

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
Somewhat of the same game

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
That you should know of before

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
Well what's pretty cool is that when the game comes out

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
They're going to be releasing a bundle that actually

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
Comes with a classic controller

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
So if you want to spend

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
$70 or $69.99

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
To be exact

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
Oh that's right because they have the

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
What's the difference? The classic controller

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
It's got the little grippies on it

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
There's a little bit extra stuff

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
But also not just the fact that it's pro

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
But it's gold, get it?

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
GoldenEye, gold

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
Golden Wii, Wii is golden

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
Golden Wii

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
So if you want to get a golden controller

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
Well there isn't actually a golden Wii

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
Just a golden classic controller pro

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
For your white Wii or your black Wii

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
Does it tell you to drink more water?

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
Sorry

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
Don't lick it

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
Don't lick the golden Wii

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
No release date

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
Announced outside the United States

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
So if you're in another country you may not be getting this

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
At all but you know what

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
Usually it's the other countries that get all those

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
Games, or not the games

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
The different colors and things for their systems

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
Before we do so

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
You can wait on this one

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
I don't know it sounds cool I already have a classic controller

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
Might not be pro with grippy things

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
I don't think I need a second one

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
Heck my Wii still isn't even hooked up

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
Although, shit

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
Metroid's out

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
Today?

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
It's next week

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
It's not next week, it's the week after next

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
Or wait, no it is next week

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
It has to be next week

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
The intro to that

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
The little trailer that was up

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
Is gorgeous

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
It looks awesome

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
I'm going to have to dust off the Wii and hook it up again

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
I think I really want to play that game

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
So we'll see

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
It's the first Wii game I've been interested in a very long time

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
But I did play Goldeneye a little bit at E3

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
And you know, it's Goldeneye

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
But I think it's just cashing on

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
The nostalgia

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
I don't think there's going to be

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
A whole lot else this brings to the table

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
Hey remember Goldeneye?

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
Hope that Oddjob isn't so much of a cheap bitch

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
I actually played as Oddjob

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
And he was an awesomely cheap bitch

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
Awesome

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
Dan and I watched this video

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
That's like the top ten dick moves

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
To pull in a game

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
And one of them is playing Oddjob

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
In deathmatch and Goldeneye

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
Okay now, I don't remember why

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
Why is he a cheap bitch?

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
Because he's short

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
It's like when he's right up on you

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
You can't shoot him

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
You have to aim low to shoot

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
But the hat toss thing is the best thing ever

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
It really is

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
There's a shoe, honestly

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
When we were in Reno at the hotel

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
I noticed

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
That the direct to your room streaming

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
For video games is N64 games

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
Which is just so backwards

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
And weird to me, I don't know why

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
It's been that way for years

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
And now what kind of technology

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
Is that run on? Is that similar to like the

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
Streaming

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
The PC games on live

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
Is that like on live in a hotel?

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
How does that work?

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
It's much lower tech than that

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
It's literally, I think, running a cartridge

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
Wow

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
So like too many people can't play it at once?

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
Since I'm on eBay right now

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
They do sell those systems sometimes

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
I don't remember what they're called

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
But they're really expensive and they have

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
A bunch of different

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
N64 games in there

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
That they can stream

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
Just while

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
Logie's looking at that, in our chatroom

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
At chat.orangelandraday.com, some of the chatters

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
Are talking about Netflix on the Wii

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
And a lot of folks using the Wii for Netflix

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
I'm talking about the LodgeNet Nintendo 64

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
Yes, wow

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
That the Wii

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
Is a good bedroom gaming console

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
And that a lot of people can get Netflix

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
In their bedroom with that

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
You do need a disc for that

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
There's no Netflix channel at this time

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
But some folks are kind of talking about that

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
Looking at a comment from Odd1 in chat asking

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
Does Goldeneye have online play?

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
I believe it does

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
But no voice chat

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
You just have to double opt in with your

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
45 digit friend code

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
Kind of what you're used to in the games

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
No voice chat, despite the fact we made this

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
Successory that we don't really use at all

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
Go Nintendo

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
Awesome

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
Alright, so

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
Going on Dark Sakura, what do you got for us?

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
Well you know what's better than a Nintendo 64

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
Lots of things actually

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
Peanut butter's better than a Nintendo 64

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
Hey

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
Mario Kart 64 was

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
Fucking awesome

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
Peanut butter is awesome

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
Dreamcast is pretty awesome

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
Guess what? They're still making games

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
I had these coconut M&M's today that were delicious

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
I had mocha M&M's

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
They were actually better than a Dreamcast

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
I have mocha M&M's and they're pretty damn good

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
I mean you can't lick a Dreamcast

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
Well you could, but it wouldn't be very tasty

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
Avoid the warranty on that

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
Unless you're Jessica Chopra

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
Anyway

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
They put out The Last Hope

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
And Wind and Water Puzzle Battles

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
And Rush Rush Rally Racing

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
They're doing more

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
Dreamcast games, they want to do more

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
And more, and they're actually trying to see if companies

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
Will release their games

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
On the Dreamcast

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
So they've got

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
Another release planned for next year

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
But to supplement

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
You know, any losses

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
They've actually, you know, well

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
To supplement their costs

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
They'll be reproducing games for WiiWare

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
And Xbox Live Arcade too

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
I was going to say, they should talk to Sega since they're going to be doing

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
Those Dreamcast games on

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
Live already

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
Yeah, when?

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
Soon

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
They did have Crazy Tax 83

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
And the guy behind it, he totally wants

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
Sega to start producing for the

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
Dreamcast again

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
Which I kind of think isn't going to happen

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
What could possibly make you think that?

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
Maybe because

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
They've said themselves the Dreamcast is over

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
Yeah

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
Also, yeah, who's going to produce new Dreamcast

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
Hardware? How long is it before the

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
Patents are up on those things and then all the

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
Korean and Chinese knockoff

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
Systems can come out, like the Nintendos

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
The Patents are up

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
On the old school Nintendos and you see all these

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
New Nintendos coming out

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
That are, you know, they don't have the

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
Blow on the cartridge problem

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
Or any of that stuff, I mean it's all kind of different now

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
I want the Famicom Disk System

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
Personally

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
I think there's one out there that plays NES and Genesis games

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
I want to say I saw

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
I have something that will do that

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
I have an NES and I have a Genesis

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
They have a Genesis one

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
And I have a PC

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
The portable Genesis one

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
I have a portable Genesis, it's called a Nomad

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
I want to say it's about 20 years, because I have a feeling

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
The Super Nintendo one is going to lapse really soon

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
It already has, they have Super Nintendo

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
systems out there

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
Do they really?

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
You know, new

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
Duo LT's and I'll be happy

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
But it would be interesting, I mean

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
Not to deviate too much from the topic at hand

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
But you know, even if Sega didn't want to do the Dreamcast

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
Themselves, license

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
Before the patent lapses

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
If they're just going to sit on it

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
Let someone else develop a Dreamcast

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
I honestly think the Dreamcast games are still pretty solid

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
You're cut out, for some reason

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
I think the Dreamcast games are still pretty solid

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
I mean, I've gone back

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
And wanted to play stuff up

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
I've been doing that today, I want to play Sonic Adventure

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
Because, well, you know

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
I'm still kind of hot

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
I'm holding the thing in

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
I'm telling you, we're not hearing you

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
Well, I'm still wanting to play

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
Sonic Colors, when it comes out

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
So I've been like, let's play Sonic Adventure

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
So

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
Alright

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
Well, we'll see how

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
Successful this venture is

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
It was also really easy to pirate Dreamcast games

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
So we'll have to see how successful this venture is

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
And hey, even if you couldn't

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
Get the game to burn right, you'd always get a great soundtrack

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
True

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
And they're those games that that company's putting out

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
They are out there

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
For piracy reasons

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
Why am I not surprised?

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
I just run them on my cabinet at home

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
Because I have a Dreamcast emulator on there

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
So, you know, fresh rush rally

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
Or whatever is pretty awesome, and I don't know where to buy that game

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
Not that I would anyway

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
Since it's like 40 bucks

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
40 bucks for a Dreamcast game, nowadays

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
No

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
Anyhow

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
So it's kind of funny

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
Apparently, Microsoft got this great idea

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
Excellent idea, that they're going to

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
Digitally distribute

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
Review copies of

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
Halo Reach to the press

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
Or press people

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
Or whomever they have that they're distributing this to

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
And it's available

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
In a games on demand format

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
Through live

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
In fact, some people found it actually

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
On the

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
Marketplace for

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
99,999

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
Microsoft points

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
Which is just, you know, it's just

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
That's not showing up on the console, right?

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
That's some website trick

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
Actually showing up on the website

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
And, you know, obviously

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
Even if you did have the

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
$1250

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
To purchase the game, it would let you

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
Purchase the game

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
Unfortunately though

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
Even though it did

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
Come up on there

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
Someone found a way to download it

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
And then people found a way

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
To crack it

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
And now it's leaked out there

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
Thanks to Microsoft

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
Which is ironic because this is probably

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
Why they did this in the first place

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
They probably switched to digital distribution

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
To avoid the piracy of the discs

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
And what happened was this

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
Game site, I think

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
GameTutorial.com

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
They

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
Originally downloaded it

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
And then they're like, haha, we have it

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
We're not going to share it with anybody

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
And somehow their copy leaked out to

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
Somebody else that was less scrupulous

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
Than they were and sent it out to the

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
Community and everybody figured out how to crack it

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
Like immediately

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
That website got it legitimately?

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
No, they found a way to hack the

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
Live server

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
To download it without actually having to have the code

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
And stuff

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
They did that

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
And

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
Yeah, so it's not

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
Too good for Microsoft

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
And of course they're investigating

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
How people were able to

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
Get this

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
Once it's on the internet, it's out there

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
That's a really bad one to lose

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
I'm surprised that

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
They didn't test this

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
On not so much of a triple A title

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
They tested it on

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
They did it with Crackdown 2 apparently

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
It's on there like that

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
But it didn't matter with Crackdown 2

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
Because that got leaked out a week or two before

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
It was actually released

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
This has been leaked out

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
Three weeks before

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
It comes out

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
The format that they've broken down to now

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
Games on Demand packages

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
Are basically how you install

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
A game onto your hard drive

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
It's that format

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
Or if you download it from their service

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
It's the same format but you're just downloading it

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
Consoles out there that are

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
Hacked with JTAG

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
Basically they can run

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
Pretty much anything

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
There's a program out there to convert

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
The games on demand packages to ISO

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
Or like a disk format

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
And then you just dump all the files on there

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
So that's what they basically did

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
After they cracked

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
The file that was on there

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
Monty Boggs in our chat

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
says

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
Bungie will ban hammer

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
That's actually kind of an interesting point

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
Because this is all being done digitally

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
And these copies are signed

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
Isn't there a way that Microsoft could

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
Ban hammer all the consoles that have this?

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
Well, yes and no

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
Because yes they could ban them

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
If they were dumb enough to take them online

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
But these are being

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
These copies that are out there right now

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
Are used on JTAG systems

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
Which are not used for online play

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
JTAG systems would get banned anyways

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
If you connected to Live after about four hours or so

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
You would get your console banned

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
So these systems are just meant for playing

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
See what they're doing now

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
Is to play online

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
Is they're using tunneling services

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
To use system like over the internet

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
To play other people

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
So that's how they're getting around it

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
So they don't care that they can't connect to Live

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
Oh they use like a warp pipe style thing

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
Yes exactly

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
So they're using tunneling services

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
To basically play online

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
And stuff like that

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
And also they're not really missing out on anything

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
If there's download content

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
Is this why we see less and less games supporting System Link?

58:27.000 --> 58:31.000
My mind goes to Starcraft 2 and the LAN thing

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
Well the LAN thing

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
That's something different

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
I think the reason why consoles don't use System Link nowadays

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
Is because the games are so sophisticated

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
That they have trouble running them as a server

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
And also running the game

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
At the same time

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
It's not easy for them to do it

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
They have to program it

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
Efficiently enough to where they can do that

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
Like I wish Grant had thought it was System Link

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
Because

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
We would still be playing our mod game

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
Because we wouldn't have to update anything

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
So we could have been doing that

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
But we had to play over Live

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
Red Dead Redemption was System Link

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
And that's awesome because our internet connection at work sucks

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
And so a lot of times we get disconnected from Live

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
So System Link is definitely the way to go

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
And also we used to play Saints Row 2

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
Which was a good backup game

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
If our Live ever went down

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
We would just play a System Link game of that

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
And of course

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
Call of Duty and Halo

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
Is always supported System Link

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
Because of the LAN play and stuff like that

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
So they're not going to just take it out

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
Because of piracy

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
But yeah it kind of sucks

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
They tried to bypass it

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
But unfortunately there's no way around it

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
But the minute you try to take a

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
Hacked version of the game

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
Or a pirated version of the game online

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
You're going to get banned

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
If they play it on your

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
Say you have an account that you would use

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
On a JTAG system and on a Live system

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
If it shows that you're playing the game

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
Before the release like that

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
They're going to probably ban you anyways

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
Or at least flag you and watch what you do

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
So obviously if you're going to play the game

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
You don't play it on your account that you use on Live

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
But

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
I don't know

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
Alright

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
But yeah it's tragic

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
But that sort of thing happens

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
What's also funny though

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
Actually kind of tying in with the hacking stuff

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
There was a USB

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
Mod chip

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
Announced actually for the Playstation 3

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
That's going to be released next week

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
And apparently

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
This chip kind of works like

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
I guess

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
A tool that they have for

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
Actual Playstation repair

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
And stuff like that it puts the system into a developers mode

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
Where you can run on signed code

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
And apparently

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
This chip or whatever

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
The USB card

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
Can be updated

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
You can update the firmware on it

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
So they can never really be locked out from the system

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
And also it's going to be able

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
You're going to be able to dump games to your hard drive

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
And run them straight off your hard drive

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
Like you could with the Playstation 2 HD loader

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
And stuff like that

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
That's something that will be interesting

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
It's called the PS Jailbreak

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
Even though I don't really think it's a jailbreak

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
But that will be coming out

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
Next week which will be interesting

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
Now what about I saw this story on some websites

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
And the story said

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
Well we don't know what's going on

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
Because they're just showing this running on a debug system

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
Which is

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
They're showing a feature that isn't new for a debug system

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
Well that was that one video

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
That was from

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
I don't remember if it was osmodchips.com

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
Or something like that

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
It's one of the stores that's selling them

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
Online they were showing it running on their debug system

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
But the thing is

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
The company or whomever that made these chips

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
Send it out to a bunch of different sites

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
To review and test out

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
And stuff like that

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
And there were other people that do not have

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Debug systems that were running it and doing the same thing

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
Can't Sony patch this out

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
In minutes?

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
No because it's the same tool that they use to fix

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
Their consoles so

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
They can't really patch it out because it would fuck up

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
I think developer consoles or something like that

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
Or if they did

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
Basically what they would have to do

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Is ban a certain

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
USB ID or something like that

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
So that it would detect

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
Okay this is this card

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
So we're going to make it so that

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
You can't run this anymore

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
But all they can do is they update the firmware

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
On that card and they can change that ID

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
Or whatever

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
So I don't

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
They say that there's no way to ban it

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
And I'd be willing to bet though that

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
I mean they may patch it

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
And they may fix it again

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
With the PSP or the DS or the Wii

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
Or anything

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
They put out patches to fix things

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
And fix loopholes

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
But it may be too hard

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
And on the other thing too

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
What this is supposed to do is

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
It will also disable forced updates

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
Forced system updates

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
So for example

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
Newer software that comes out has the newer system versions

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
And stuff like that

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
And you can actually disable it from updating your system

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
So if you're playing offline

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
I don't know

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
It would be interesting to watch

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
Because now the one console system

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
That was the most secure

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
Has now been cracked wide open

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
It would be interesting to see

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
Vidpower in our chatroom says

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
What is with the term jailbreaking

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
Being used for everything that involves hacking?

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
You know the iPhones use that term too

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
I don't know

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
It's a clever term

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
And it caught on

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
It's a buzzword

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
It's trendy

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
It kind of makes sense for the iPhone

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
But it's trendy so everyone wants to use it now

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
I'm thinking about jailbreaking my phone

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Just so I can downgrade the stupid OS

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
I hate iOS 4 on a 3G

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
Supposedly there's a patch coming

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
But we've been waiting what

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
Two months?

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Actually I just updated the patch

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
On my 3GS

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
And I've noticed it running a little bit better

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
3GS's are different though

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
I know but I'm saying

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
It could have included some fixes

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
I'm not going to hold my breath

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
But I will get excited about this

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
I'm very excited about this announcement

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
Well of sorts

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
It's about the game Torchlight

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
Which is a little kind of PC

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
I don't know if you want to say indie game

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
It's by Runic Games which is made up

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
Of a lot of people who were with Blizzard

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
At one time or what have you

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
But it's a cool game one way or the other

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
If you like Diablo 2 this is a great kind of holdover

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
While you wait for Diablo 3

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
Torchlight

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
Originally they wanted to put Torchlight on Xbox Live Arcade

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
But they actually

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
I guess kind of held off for whatever reason

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
Didn't end up doing it

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
But now they're apparently putting serious effort

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
Into actually making a console version of Torchlight

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
And it was announced at Gamescom

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
By the Runic CEO Max Schaeffer

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
Quote, we're trying

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
We're talking to Sony and Microsoft

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
And we hope to get that done quickly

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
And they want to have it available by the holidays

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
Just so you know this game

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
Has actually already moved about 750,000 units

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
So it's already almost sold close to a million

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
Which isn't bad for a game like this

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
That's been mostly digital distribution

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
I know I got it on one of those crazy

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
Steam sales

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
And I'm sure a lot of you guys did

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
As well

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Get it that way

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
Piracy apparently has been an issue with this game

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
Unfortunately

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
So they can't track how many illegal copies are going on out there

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
But seeing as Torchlight 2

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
Is going to be multiplayer

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
Especially if this does go to Xbox Live and so forth

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
They'll have that to think about

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
They'll be able to track that a little better

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
There's also a Torchlight MMO

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Happening at some point

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
So we'll see

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
It'll be interesting though if Torchlight goes to Xbox Live

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
And PSN because it's only single player

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
One of its biggest drawbacks is there isn't really multiplayer in it

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
That's why they're doing Torchlight 2

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
And a lot of the games on

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
Xbox Live Arcade and Playstation Network

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
Really thrive on a multiplayer environment

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
Not all of them, like what, Mega Man 9

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
Is it really multiplayer?

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
There's other stuff out there that doesn't

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
Have to be multiplayer

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
But uh

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
It'll be very cool to have a Diablo style game

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
On Xbox Live I think

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
I don't know, what do you think? You're a fan of Torchlight, right Alan?

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
What do you think of this game moving to the

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
Consoles?

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
Whatever will help it get a larger audience

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
So that when, if the MMO

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
When it does come out

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
It'll succeed, then I'm all for it

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
Alright

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Let's move on to some more gaming news

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
Then we'll get to some release dates, StarkSakra

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
Well

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
You know how some places

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Have these archaic laws on the books

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Like, in Alabama it's illegal

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
To walk around with an ice cream cone in your back pocket

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
Did you know that?

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
Now I wanna go and just do it

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
I don't know if you can walk around with an ice cream cone in your back pocket

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
With a crunch

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
It's possible, but it gets soggy

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
Well, the city of Beacon, New York

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
Has one that says

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
That there can't be pinball

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
Tables, they're illegal there

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
And now they're enforcing it

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
They've shut down

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
A retro arcade

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
You cut out for a minute

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
They shut down a retro arcade

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Didn't pinball

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
Used to be associated with gambling

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
In the mafia and things like that

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
Years and years ago, so maybe that's where the law came from

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
And, you know, them darn kids

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
Um, the mayor of Beacon

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
You might have to switch mics

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
The mayor of Beacon said it was

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
Is this better?

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
Yes

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
Okay, they said it was about noise

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
That people complained about the noise

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
And blah blah blah blah blah

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
And so they said

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
Well, we'll just use this law

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
As a convenient excuse to enforce

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
The noise thing

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
Which is bull

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
I mean, seriously?

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
I know, I would actually like to see

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
What other businesses are around the people

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
That supposedly complained

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
So

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
You know, I think it was on CNN

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
Or one of the news channels

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
They were actually showing this place

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
And it actually looked kind of cool

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
And I'm thinking, like, I've never heard of this town

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
Until this happened, but

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
There was this place there that I thought

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
I might want to visit someday

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
But now I guess I can't

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
It's kind of a bummer

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
Because this place is somewhat unique

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
And I bet they would have had visitors

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
I don't know how far it is from New York City

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
But I bet there would have been folks in that

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
New York area that might take a trip out

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
To upstate someday to go take a look at it

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
But obviously they can't now

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
They're shooting themselves in the foot

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
And the guy's saying

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
We tried to help them save their business

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
And find them other locations

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
And use decibel tests to be objective

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
And blah blah blah

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
It's just crap

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
The loudest thing that happens

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
When I play pinball is when

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
I miss and I go, God damn it

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
And I'm just yelling

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
At the table

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
Do you think maybe that's what happened there?

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
Was just an outbreak of people saying, God damn it, shit

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
You know, if they had good carpeting

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
It would have totally muted the noise

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
There used to be

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
There was a little tiny arcade

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
Out in Roseville called Supercade

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
Years and years ago, run by this old gentleman

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
That sadly he got put out of business

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
He was in the middle of a strip mall

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
He had tons of pinball games and arcade games

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
And he never

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
Got noise complaints

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
Or what have you

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
There's people that own retro arcade tables

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
And have them out in the Galleria

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
In a hallway

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
So in the Danos

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
Interesting

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
Alright, well let's start to travel the world

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
And take a look at some release dates

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
And hopefully these games will not be banned

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
In your local city

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
Yes, not a whole lot

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
Coming out this week

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
But there's some pretty good stuff

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
Let's just start with the stuff

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
Not necessarily the good stuff

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
Martian Panic

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
From Zoo Games

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
It's a generic arcade shooter game

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
Available with a neon green

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
Shotgun, or by itself

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
Those of course on the Wii

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
Nancy Drew, Secrets Can Kill 2010

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
Coming out on PC

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
Umm...

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
Elemental War of Magic

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
On PC as well from

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
Stardock

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
Oh god, I forgot this was coming out

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Because

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
Someone thought it was a great idea to put

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
Grease the musical

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
Or like the sing-along version of it

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
I guess, in theaters

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
There's Grease the video game

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
Coming out on Wii and DS

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
Where you can sing and dance with the

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
Casts of Grease

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
In opportunity form

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
Fun

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
This is pretty cool

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
Gunblade NYC

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
And L.A. Machine Guns

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
A game I seriously played tons of

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
Back in the Qsar days

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
Coming to the Wii as well

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
For a wonderful $30 retail price

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
Just like that House of the Dead 2 and 3 collection

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
It should be pretty fun

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
Gotta go back and play Ghost Squad some more

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
That's some fun stuff

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
Umm...

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
Dead Edition will also be coming out this week as well

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
Umm...

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
Mafia 2 on Playstation 3

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
And Xbox 360

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
And PC this week

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
Umm...

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
That game from 2K

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
Harvest Moon Grand Bazaar on DS this week

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
Here's a game for Rob

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
Hello Kitty Online

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
Coming out on PC this week

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
Yay! Wait, I thought this had been out for a while

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
Well, apparently it's the disc version

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
Of the game

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
It's just digital before you

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
NHL 2K11 on the Wii

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
Coming out this week

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
Ivy the Kiwi

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
On DS and Wii this week

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
The Bachelor

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
The video game

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
Okay, wait, you've said that game like three times

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
It's been delayed a ton of times, okay

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
I wonder why

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
Because it's a terrible, terrible game

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
I think they just want you to keep announcing it every week

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
So they keep delaying it one week at a time

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
You know that they are putting out an amazing race game

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
When I was in Reno, I played an amazing race slot machine

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
That was actually really cool

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
It was like a high budget thing

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
It had a huge subwoofer in it

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
It had Phil

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
That's all you need

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
It was a nice slot machine

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
And the one at Calneva

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
I won a ton of money on

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
Well, not a ton, for pennies I won a ton of money

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
But the one at Eldorado ripped me off

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
So just a word to the wise

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
That go to Reno to do their gaming

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
Go play at Calneva because their slots are looser

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
Yeah, The Bachelor video game

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
Eventually is going to come out at some point

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
Then making way for probably more crappier games

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
Oh, actually I know it's making way for more crappier games

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
Like Survivor and Minute to Win It

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
And

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
Pretty much any game show that's on TV now

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
Is going to have a game based on it

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
And it's going to be on the Wii

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
Because that's what they do

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
Battlefield Bad Company 2

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
The Ultimate Edition

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
A re-release with a bunch of download content

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
And fun download content for

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
Battlefield 1943

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
As well

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
Or 1942, I don't remember which game it is

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
Anyways, that's on

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
Ghost Pirate of Vuju Island

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
On PC, some value game there

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
From Disney

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
Guilty Party

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
Kind of like a clue type of game

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
That's on the Wii

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
Yeah, we talked about that a little while ago

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
This time it's actually coming out

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
Camp Rock the Final Jam on DS

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
A new movie

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
Ace Combat Joint Assault on PSP

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
Valkria Chronicles 2

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
On PSP as well

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:25.000
Game called Cosmo's Chaos on the DS

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
Of course, the big one this week

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
Metroid Other M, coming out on the Wii

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
And

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
And I believe that's it

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
Oh, no, there's a couple other crappier games here

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
At the very end

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
Valkria on the DS, my first dollhouse on the DS

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
And Prison Tycoon in Alcatraz on PC

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
Prison Tycoon in Alcatraz, wow

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
Chat.orangewonnagevideo.com

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
More comments from the chat room

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
Brakeman in our chat says

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
Yay, amazing race! Wait, what's the amazing race?

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
It's a TV show

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
Here

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
I thought they had it in other countries, maybe not

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
But it's like teams of two that go around the world

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
And it literally is a race

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
They pick up clues

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
It's like, I don't want to say a scavenger hunt

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
What's the other kind of game?

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
Isn't there a game that people

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
can play where you go from point A to point B

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
and pick up clues along the way? I don't know what the name for that is

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
But that's the reason why it is

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
You do tasks at every

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
point in every city and you move on and the winner gets a million bucks

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
It's a show

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
And let's see

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
Chat.orangewonnagevideo.com more comments

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
Where's the mole game? asks Frisbee

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
Excellent question

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
That was the best reality show they ever did

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
Monty Boggs says, how come Big Brother Wii

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
doesn't sound appealing to me?

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
Because you're not trashy

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
They still may do that

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
If the Survivor game sells, why not?

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
They had, was it

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
America's Top...

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
Do they have America's Top Model?

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
They had America's Top Model

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
What other

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
crappy games did they have?

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
Wipeout

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
They had a thing for that

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
I get Minute to Win it because they're just going to do

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
Wii versions of all those stupid games

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
they play on that show

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
Let's go to Target, the game

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
and buy paper cups and ping pong balls

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
and pay somebody a million dollars

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
to do the tricks

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
I'm surprised they don't have a home game yet

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
I believe it's coming out

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
if it's not already out

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
It's not hard to do

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
a home version of Minute to Win it

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
Go to the dollar store

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
Exactly, dollar store the game

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
SSG100Matt says

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
Robin Allen should be on The Amazing Race

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
I'm a Robin Jamie

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
Actually, I don't know how Allen feels about being on Network TV

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
like The Amazing Race, but I gotta say, me and my friend Victoria

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
have been talking about it for at least two years

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
how badly we need to go on The Amazing Race

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
I don't drive, and there's usually

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
you know, you have to get into

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
a jeep and one person does something

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
while the other person drives

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
and I couldn't do that

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
My favorite task I ever saw on The Amazing Race

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
was when they were in Thailand

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
and they had to get in these taxis

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
but they're karaoke taxis

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
Thai karaoke songs from point A to point B

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
or whatever, but they were actually

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
singing with women

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
in the back seat, but they were actually female

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
impersonators, and some of the teams

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
didn't even catch on to it

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
that they were singing with

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
Taiwan Asian female impersonators

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
Was there like a bro team

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
asking for their number?

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
You know there was, they showed it on TV

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
but the challenge cracked me up

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
I do free Xenocord

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
they do need a supermarket sweep game

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
I thought there was one

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
a while ago, a supermarket sweep game

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
like on PC or something

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
I love that game

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
watching that on, what was it, Lifetime?

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
Also, Press Your Luck

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
there is a Press Your Luck game on Wii

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
and I think there's another one coming out this year too

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
Yeah, there's Press Your Luck, A Price is Right

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
There's a new Wheel of Fortune game

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
New Jeopardy

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
A lot of those game shows

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
are actually out

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
I don't know how good they are

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
I seem to remember

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
X-Link called into the show some time ago

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
and he's told me about it since then

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
that the Press Your Luck game is surprisingly not bad

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
I mean, you get what you pay for

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
Right? I mean, if you buy a

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
Press Your Luck game, you know exactly what game

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
you're buying

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
It's not a big surprise

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
Is it responsive?

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
Do the questions repeat after

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
playing it three times?

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
That's all you really need, right?

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
You know what you're buying when you buy the Press Your Luck home game

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
Alright, let's get to the Japanese release dates

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
Enough about game shows. I could talk all day about game shows

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
I love game shows

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
In fact, I would love to see

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
the Sherri Shepherd version of the Newlywed game

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
because you know she's going to make a great house

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
Comment about the American X-Top Model game

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
Didn't sell well because no matter

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
what you did, Tyra got a better score

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
than you and then she yelled at you

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
So that didn't sell well

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
So here's a question though

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
What would happen if you had Tyra play

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
the America's Top Model game?

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
Now would it go into an infinite loop like

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
the Tic Tac Show game in WarGames?

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
If she still had her show

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
she would have used this opportunity to see

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
Now me, and here's my game

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
I had so much fun recording this

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
I had so much fun doing my game

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
The Tyra show really was the Tyra show

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
It was about Tyra

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
She could be doing a whole show on anorexia

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
and bulimia and one time she'd be like

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
I remember this one time when I was at a restaurant

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
and I didn't want to eat what was in front of me

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
and I found that to be so hard

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
I cried that I had the salad

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
and it was very devastating to me emotionally

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
Let's go to Japanese release dates

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
Kane & Lynch 2 Dog Days

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
comes out on the 26th on the

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
Xbox 360 hip hip hooray

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
That is a Japanese release

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
so I don't know if they fully localized it

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
or what but that is coming out

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
They're actually played by dogs now

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
Now that I'd buy

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
That would make the Kane & Lynch series like

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
ten times better

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
if it was a gritty crime drama

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
with canines, dogs

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
Hold down R2 to scoot your butt

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
Alright, on the PlayStation 3

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
Kane & Lynch 2 Dog Days

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
is also coming out over there

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
No word if you can press R3 to poop

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
Agarest Zenkei Zero

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
compile heart selection

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
comes out as well

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
I'm imagining it's some type of compilation

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
It's the record of the Agarest Wars

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
or at least maybe a sequel to it

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
the one where you can breed

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
It is a prelude to Agarest Zenki

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
so it is actually a prequel

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
You have to breed to create the new game

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
That has something in common

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
with a dog game then

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
Let's see, moving to

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
Man, and ten dogs

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
would be so much cooler if they gave

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
the dogs guns

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
Don't you think?

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
They have a game like that

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
This got brought up

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
at my work the other day too

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
It would be even cooler if dogs had guns

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
on their back

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
Yeah, but they've done that

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
It's Metal Max

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
or something?

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
Sega was what came out over here

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
They have dogs

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
with artillery cannons on their back

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
Ridiculous stuff

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
It's awesome

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
Coming out on the Wii in Japan

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
I talked about this last week

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
It's coming out on the 26th

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
Twinkle Queen comes out on

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
the Nintendo Wii

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
What kind of game do you think Twinkle Queen is, Alan?

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
I don't know, but I'm still waiting for my royalty check

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
I think it's Twinkle Star Sprites

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
It is

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
Here's the description

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
So is Carmen Sandiego coming back?

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
I don't think it's those types of PC games

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
I don't think of Laidback and

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
Tea Drinker as the same

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
I think of tight-assed

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
and ramrod straight

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
back Tea Drinker

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
being proper

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
Character themes and other background music will be imported from the

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
originals and rearranged for Twinkle Queen

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
A maximum of four players

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
can play the game at a time

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
So I love it, it's PC games

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
but it's coming out on the Wii

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
I'm looking at the screenshots and I don't see Carmen Sandiego

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
but I do see a lot of

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
scantily clad women

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
from Katamari Damacy

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
She's there

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
I think it would be laid back if your tea was laced with something

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
Isn't that the Queen from Katamari Damacy?

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
Yes it is

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
Is this a Romco Bandai game?

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
No, it's from Milestone

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
Maybe they licensed it or something

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
I swear that looks like the Queen from Katamari Damacy

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
No, she's wearing a kimono

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
So is it a fighting game?

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
It's probably something behind her head

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
Interesting

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
Oh well

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
Chicks beating each other up

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
We haven't seen that before

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
Actually we have

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
Nah, it's a joke

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
We've seen it tons of times

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
That's why I'm joking

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
Alright, anyhow, moving on to the handhelds

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
There's nothing on PlayStation 2

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
just so you know

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
On the Sony PSP

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
Ace Combat

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
Joint Assault

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
Hakioki Zusoruku

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
Portable comes out this week

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
from Idea Factory

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
I don't know what this game is

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
This is an adventure game

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
that

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
I don't know

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
This chick's cuddling with her blanket

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
in one of the cutscenes

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
Looks very dating sim

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
This looks like a girl dating sim game

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
Aren't these all boys trying to be her suitor?

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
Maybe that's what it is

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
Suitor, sperm donor

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
We got the bachelor here

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
We got that there

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
Monhoniki

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
Poka Poka Ailoumura

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
That's what she's hoping for

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
That's coming out from Capcom

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
I'm trying to see what game

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
it is, if it's something we would know here

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
You guys recognize this game?

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
They look like the characters from Animal Crossing

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
Don't they?

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
This is like a PSP version of Animal Crossing

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
No it's not

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
It's the little

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
I think ascii cat people

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
They kind of look like Doraemon

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
A little bit

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
They have ears

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
Interesting

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
Quickly on the DS

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
Sorry I'm taking a long time here

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
On the Nintendo DS

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
Nothing really notable

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
that comes out this week

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
Unfortunately

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
So there you go

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
Those are your Japanese release dates

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
Let's go to jolly old England

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
and talk about their releases

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
On the 24th we have Grease for Wii and DS

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
On the 24th we also have Gunblade New York

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
and L.A. Machine Guns Arcade

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
I'm a big fan of Gunblade New York

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
for the record

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
We also have Ivy the Kiwi

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
It's got a question mark at the end

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
So it's Ivy the Kiwi

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
It's coming out here

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
You have cut out yet again

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
Live radio folks

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
We have Ivy the Kiwi

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
Kiwi

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
Shank

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
Game vs. the World

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
and Shank again on Xbox 360

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
On the 27th we have Mafia 2

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
for PC, PS3, and 360

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
Alright

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
That's it

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
A few more news stories for you guys

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
in the classic game of the week

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
Sony has been ordered to pay 5 million yen

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
to a former Sony employee

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
who is named

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
Looks like

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
Hiro Kume

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
and he invented

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
I guess a small optical pickup

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
that was used to read and write discs

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
in the Playstation 2 and the original Playstation

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
Of course he felt that

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
Sony didn't recognize his contributions

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
and he took them to court

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
and he won

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
So that's not bad

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
and it roughly translates to

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
about $60,000

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
is what he won

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
and he says

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
I thank the court for identifying

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
some of my contributions to the company

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
but the company should have appreciated

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
my contributions when I was an employee

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
Ouch

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
Scathing a little bit

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
Speaking of lawsuits

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
This guy

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
Craig Smallwood apparently is his name

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
sued the makers of Lineage

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
He wants

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
basically them to fess up to the fact

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
that their game is too damn addicting

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
in so many words

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
that Lineage 2 specifically is so addicting

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
that he is quote

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
unable to function independently in usual daily activities

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
such as getting up, getting undressed,

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
bathing or communicating with family and friends

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
Apparently he played the game

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
for 20,000 hours

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
between 2004 and 2009

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
That's like literally

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
half of every single day

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
playing Lineage 2

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
Hmm

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
Apparently it's negligence

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
and gross negligence there

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
I think Bobby was talking about this story on his show too

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
and he found through some other resources I guess

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
that the guy was actually running a gold farming service

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
in this game

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
because you'll notice

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
he played for 20,000 hours between 2004 and 2009

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
Doesn't really point out why he stopped

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
So is he really addicted to the game

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
or is he just a jilted gold farmer?

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
I don't know

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
It seems like a combination of

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
I don't know, OCD

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
that could be a legitimate situation that he was in

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
but also he had

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
I guess from when we were listening to

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
Bobby Blackwolf's show

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
he had three accounts that he was using to gold farm

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
Maybe he realized that his return on investment

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
was so much better the more

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
hours he logged into each of his three accounts

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
and that's what got him

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
addicted

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
I have to play 12 hours a day

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
because then I'll make $100 this week

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
and uh

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
that could be it

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
Well let's just assume that wasn't

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
even all a factor

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
and that's off the table for a minute here

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
We're just talking about somebody suing

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
the makers of the game they've become addicted to

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
because their game is too addicting

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
I mean, really? Does that mean I can sue

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
McDonald's because I'm addicted to Chicken McNuggets

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
and they made me fat?

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
They've tried, people have tried

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
Really? What a country

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
I know, it's ridiculous

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
The whole thing is coming down to lack of self control

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
You know, I love Star Trek Online

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
You know how much I love the damn game

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
Guess who doesn't stay logged into it

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
for more than two hours at a time

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
That would be me

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
Even if my friends in the UK are on

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
I log off

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
As much as I love talking to them

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
You know, when I was playing

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
Ragnarok

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
Maybe I would leave it on to vend

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
But I would walk away from my computer

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
You know

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
It's addiction

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
Well not really addiction

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
There's no

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
Now the only thing that I could remotely say

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
of physical effect is

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
This is getting into a little bit

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
of chemical psychology

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
Is what stimulates the pleasure centers of the brain

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
And that does become addicting

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
You know, for example

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
Love has the same effect

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
in the brain that cocaine can

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
You know

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
And that's the only way

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
I can see any kind of addiction

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
possibly forming

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
But that's where the self control

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
comes in

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
It may be hard

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
But you have to take some time for yourself

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
Get away from the game

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
I don't know what Lineage 2 has in place

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
It's not a game I've played

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
I played it at E3 a few years ago

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
And have a can of coke in my vault

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
Oh

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
Was that the game that gave away the soda?

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
This was years ago

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
I think I remember it now

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
It wasn't a bad game

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
It's way more popular

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
in Asia than it is here

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
Way more popular

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
Wow is the US game

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
Lineage and Lineage 2 are twice that

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
what it is here

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
I recognize the

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
art style on this can

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
The character creation

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
Lineage is a huge game over there

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
I believe this gentleman lives in Hawaii

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
So Hawaii gets

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
a little bit of a blending of both cultures

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
a lot of times

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
Lineage probably has a pretty good fan base

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
Certainly has its players

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
here in the continental US too

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
I don't know

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
It's just a lot of other

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
games I've played

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
Like WoW

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
I joke that I'm addicted to WoW

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
But at the end of the day, for instance

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
Alan and I went to Reno this weekend

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
And we walked away

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
Believe it or not, we're okay

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
We're gonna run our daily the minute we get home

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
But we're okay

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
There have been times in WoW where it's like

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
maybe midnight, 1am

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
Daily, rep, whatever, BS

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
And I'm not tired yet

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
But I'm just on my mount

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
doing laps around Dalaran

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
And I'm not really playing

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
I'm like, what am I doing right now?

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
I'm in WoW

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
I have nothing to do

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
I should just log off

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
And I've had moments where I just have to make myself sign off

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
And you're not even chatting?

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
Because I've done that, but it's because I'm chatting with people

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
Like I'll be running laps in Dalaran, but I'm also chatting

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
Well I'll be reading Trade or whatever

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:31.000
There's nothing morally redeeming about Trade Chat

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
Yeah, it's like 4chan, but in WoW

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
Pretty much

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
But WoW, when you log in

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
Well, I don't remember if WoW has it when you log in

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
But at least I know some of the tip screens say

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
Some of the loading screens will say

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
Remember to take everything in moderation

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
Including Warcraft

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
Final Fantasy XI had a disclaimer

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
You had to click every time

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
Don't forget your friends, family, or work

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
You know, this whole little spiel

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
Every two or three hours?

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
No, every time you logged into the game you had to click it

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
Yeah, I remember that

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
But I mean

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
It really does come back

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
You know, and this

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
I can be on AIM and get caught up in a conversation with somebody

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
That's one thing

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
You know, I could be

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
Online reading news articles

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
And get caught up in reading

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
Or I do it with Wikipedia all the damn time

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
But the whole thing is

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
To catch yourself

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
To make reminders

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
When you notice the time

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
Then

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
Oh crap, I've gone on too long

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
You know, I'll have to check this later

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
I don't really think

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
I think that maybe going like

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
An hour or two over

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
When you decided that you wanted to stop

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
That's kind of understandable

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
Getting caught up is human nature

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
But to make a habit of it

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
And to

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
Play to the exclusion of all else

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
That's when it gets unhealthy

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
Well, again

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
I don't know if he's going to be very

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
Successful suing the makers of the game

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
Because he couldn't control himself

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
I just think it would set a horrific precedence

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
You know, we could sue anything

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
That had a negative effect on us

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
I mean, it's just

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
You have to have some self control

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
It's just kind of sad that the judge wouldn't throw it out

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
But nope, the judge actually

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
Is allowing the case to proceed

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
That should be interesting

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
You know why I would think it would be a good idea

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
To let a case like that proceed?

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
So he's struck down

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
Setting legal precedence

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
I can see that

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
Let's see, XenaCorner in our chatroom at chat.orangelandraday.com

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
Says Lineage 2 is an unreal engine converted

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
Grinding piece of shit

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
Or POS, I'm assuming meaning piece of shit

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
Tigerclaw says

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
You know, Starcraft 2 can be quite addicting

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
The other night I was playing it late at night

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
And by the time I stopped it was like 5am in the morning

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
Yeah, well a lot of video games

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
I mean, Starcraft I've heard of tons of addictions

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
Addictions of varying degrees

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
Stories of that

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
But I'm sure there's lots of video games

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
Even Jamie has talked about

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
When you were in high school or college

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
You stayed out for a week to play

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
And granted, I did have the flu

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
Legitimately

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
But all I did was play Final Fantasy

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
It was Final Fantasy 3

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
6 over in Japan

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
That's the only game I've ever

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
You know, played

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
While I was that sick

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
You know, when I had my surgery

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
I played tons of Blue Dragon last time

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
I didn't play any games this time because my hand

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
Heard a different way

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
But I played a ton of Blue Dragon last time

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
You know

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
Big deal

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
I wouldn't

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
I played a lot of Final Fantasy 7 when I was supposed to be in college

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
I'd skip class from time to time

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
To watch Sailor Moon or play Toushinden

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
I mean

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
And when my friend

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
Had his

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
He had a Saturn before everybody else because he imported it

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
And I stayed up all night playing

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
The damn Gundam game

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
And King of Fighters

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
But that's one time

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
You know

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
Alright

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
Well speaking of addicting games

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
I think it's time for us to take a trip down memory lane

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
And look at some of the games of the past

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
And that's in a segment we call

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
The Classic Game of the Week

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
Dark Sakura is picked as an addicting game

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
But it's certainly one she thinks

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
Kicks ass

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
It's the Classic Game of the Week

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
Dark Sakura, what should the kids be worshipping this week?

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
The game is called Wrecka

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
And this game was made

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
For the Summer Carnival in 1992

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
It's a very limited

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
Printing of it

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
But it's amazing for an S game

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:45.000
This isn't some music

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
You see it's got a pretty rad soundtrack

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
For an S game

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
All I hear are the bullets

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
I've got the soundtrack to this

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
But now the game itself

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
Is probably one of the

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
I would say earlier

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
Games that could be considered

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
Bullet hell

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
Really I think it could be

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
I mean you see who in the chat room got

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
Freaking excited with one of our

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
Bullet hell fans

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
But

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
Wrecka is

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
Pretty damn hardcore

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
I mean we've got ROMs of it

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
You can actually buy

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
Let me get this site again

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
I think it was

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
Wreckaness

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
You can buy reproduction

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
Cartridges

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
To play on US systems

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
Which is pretty cool

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
But the game

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
What makes it really special is that

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
It is

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
One of the

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
Highest

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
Sprite counts

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
In a game at a fast pace

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
And you can see

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
While it's playing on there

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
It's not really so much of a flicker

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
It's playing pretty smoothly

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
On the actual system

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
I'm seeing some flicker but it seems like they do some tricks

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
With the way the bullets fly out and things

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
I don't know if that's just the frame rate

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
In a conversion to YouTube or what

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
But it seems like they do some

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
It looks really amazing the frame rate

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
For a NES game

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
On the YouTube it's blazing fast

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
I'm really impressed by this

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
It really does play that fast

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
The game itself

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
Was published by

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
Naxastsoft

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
N-A-X-A-T

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
In 1992 like I said for the summer

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
Carnival

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
It is a side scroller

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
It has

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
Bottom to top

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
Scrolling

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
You get all kinds

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
Of power ups

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
Modifiable power ups

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
The ones you wait for them to change

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
Or you can shoot them and they'll change

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
This particular stage that we're watching

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
This is just the second level

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
You go up through this tube

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
And then you go backwards down the tube

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
That's kind of rad I like that

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
Yeah

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
And the soundtrack for it

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
Is freaking amazing

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
The other

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
Things that you have with this too

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
Is that instead of having bombs

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
That when you stop shooting

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
You can build up a power surge

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
And deflect

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
Incoming fire

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
And then if you charge it long time

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
It'll clear the screen

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
The way a bomb would do

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
Um

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
It's really hard to do that though

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
Because as you can see how fast the enemies come at you

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
And look at the effects in the background

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
I mean that's very

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
Looks almost mode 7-ish

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
I should say

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
And this was before there was such a thing as mode 7

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
It has a normal

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
Score attack and time attack

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000
It's single player only

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
Um

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000
The game is cool

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
You've got five primary weapons

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
And then five optional weapons

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
Um so you get different power ups

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
And you can shoot different ways

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000
It's just really really amazing

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
But this isn't one of the typical story

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000
Oh you have to fight off the aliens

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
Blah blah save the earth

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
And

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
I think that Wrecka is just a freaking cool name

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
For uh

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
For a game that needs blazing fire

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
But the official name is

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
World Consumer Series Summer Carnival

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
92 Wrecka

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
And good luck freaking finding it

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
I just even love that idea of flying

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
Up the tunnel and then flying back down

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
Like you just don't see that in a lot of shooters

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
At least that I can think of

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
Usually in fact shooters are almost always

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
Ship is on the bottom and you're moving

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
Your way up

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000
Or you rarely ever see it the other way

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
Rarely ever see it the other way

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
Around where you're flying at the top of the screen

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000
Moving down

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000
You know the only other game that I've seen some kind of innovation

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000
For the standard side scrolling shooter

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
Was that same Gundam game that was on the Saturn

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000
Back in the day when it came out

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
Because you had um three planes

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000
You were in the middle ground

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
But you had foreground and background

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
Enemies to fight too

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000
And now this here is stationary

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000
Not just that as a non-standard shooter

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
But I always think of of course this game

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
We never talk enough about it here on Orange Knows Radio

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
One of the most underrated NES games they ever made

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
Was half shooter and a decent shooter at that

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000
And then half Zelda-ish game

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
In fact if we do end up doing our little labor day marathon

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000
I think we should just play the shit out of that game

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
And beat it

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
Dude I'm all for it

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000
But yeah see that right there

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000
Is the example of the charging move

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
That's a pretty sweet game for an NES game

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
It's just it's super rare

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000
And that's why

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
Those reproduction cartridges are out

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
I'm actually considering

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000
Getting one

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000
It's supposed to be um

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000
Let me see how much they're selling it for

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000
On the website

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000
I believe that if you pay

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
$58

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000
That's on check or money order

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
Standard delivery you get

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
The gray cartridge

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000
A reproduction box and a manual

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
It's done in our chatroom as saying that

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
Legend consumer series only applies to the soundtrack

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:11.000
It's just Summer Carnival 92 Wrecka

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
Well the soundtrack

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000
Cut out

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
What?

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000
The soundtrack is worth having

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000
I found it actually to download somewhere

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
So

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000
Speaking of the soundtrack go get it

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000
The music is really sweet

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000
Alright there it is your classic game of the week

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000
Wrecka

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000
Or if you want Summer Carnival 92 Wrecka

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
For the Nintendo Entertainment System

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000
Good luck finding that although it does sound like you get

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000
The reproduced cartridges

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
If nothing else

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000
Somebody get me one

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000
That's gonna do it for part A here at Orange Lounge Radio

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000
But we're not done yet we got more news coming up in part B

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000
We're gonna talk a little bit about Rock Band 3

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
Talk a little bit about Dance Central

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
Lots of music game news

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000
We're gonna talk about a new drawing tablet on the Wii

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000
Talk of course a little bit about Doctor Who

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
And more hacking news

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
And also ways to cut the lines

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000
At PAX

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
We'll be interested to see what the chatters think about this story

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000
We're gonna be getting to this

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000
Your emails, your twitter topics and much more

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000
Your phone calls when we come back here at the show

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000
Where every gamer has a voice

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000
Orange Lounge Radio

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
We are live on this Sunday evening

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000
August the 22nd of 2010

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000
Where we are taping live

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000
The 378th episode of our show

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000
Yeah

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
It's been about 8 and a half years

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000
So there you go

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000
Lots of news coming at you here in part B

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000
We're gonna get into that in a minute

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
Your twitter topics here just a few minutes away

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
Thought we could talk a little more about Reno

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
And some of the fun experiences we had up there

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
There's actually some interesting arcades up there

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
Did anything in the arcades catch your eye?

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
While you were up there?

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000
We were in the big one at Circus Circus

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000
That was mostly just you know ticket

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000
Ticket spitters you know gambling for kids

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
I did see a smaller arcade

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
That I never got a chance to actually go into

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
That had a lot of Capcom stuff

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000
Like they had MVC 2

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
Yeah remember when we were looking in there

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
You were like no that's my kind of arcade

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
Yeah well it's like my butt you know

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000
I've got 10 bucks is it gonna last longer on slots

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000
Or on arcade games

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
So arcade games 1

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
Ray Ayanami says we should have gone to Atlantis

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
What do they have there

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000
Oh they probably have really

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000
The problem with a lot of those huge huge ones

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
They're not downtown

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
The downtown ones are much easier

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000
Because they're all kind of in the same city block

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000
You don't have to get in the car and go whatever

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000
Anything else interesting in Reno that you came across?

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
The fact that it's kind of

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000
I don't want

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000
How can I say this without sounding pretentious

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000
Just Reno is

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000
Kind of low budget

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000
I mean that's kind of the point

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000
If you can afford to go to Vegas

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000
You just go to Vegas

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000
So Reno is really kind of watered down

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
We had a hilariously awful

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000
Dining experience there

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
Which I thought was funny considering it's

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
Amazing sort of you know

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000
The El Dorado, Silver Legacy, Circus Circus

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000
It's all one big mall they're all connected

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000
You can just stay in that facility

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000
So it was after Rocky

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000
And it was around 1130 we were all starving

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
And exhausted

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
So we sat down

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.000
Not even kidding

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000
30 minutes for her to take our order

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
Another 35 for our food to arrive

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000
So we were at the table for about an hour

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
And the food showed up and I had joked

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
That when we got our receipt

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000
For the tip section we should write

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000
In the margin

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000
We put your tip in that slot machine

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000
And you should go get it

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
Very nice

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
I've taken something from my

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
Best friend

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000
She leaves two cents

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
Yeah I've done that before

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000
I once was in I think it was in Olive Garden

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
Which is why I don't like going there

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000
Where the friend and I that I was with

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000
It was like 7 cents

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000
It was a very specific amount of change

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
To where they knew it was deliberate

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000
Well you know it was hard though in that case

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000
I really don't like doing that

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
Unless it really is clearly

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000
This weight person's fault

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
But last night I don't know

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000
I kind of got the feeling like the place was just badly managed

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000
Like I felt like the weight person was working

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000
I mean she was trying her best

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000
So I didn't want to be a dick

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000
But you know it was really bad

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
The food was good but yours was cold

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000
We all had hot food but yours was cold

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.000
So that was lame

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000
Very lame

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
We're going to do this real quick

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
I'm getting a lot of complaints in chat that we're skipping really bad

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000
And I don't know why that would be happening

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000
So I just want to remind everybody in studio

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.000
Take a minute to make sure you don't have anything running in the background

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000
That could be doing bandwidth

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000
What I'm going to do, I'm going to do a quick

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000
Disconnect and reconnect

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000
So for live listeners you might get dumped

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
Just reconnect real quick

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
But I'm going to see if that helps fix the problem here

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000
I'm going to do a quick disconnect and reconnect

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000
And see what happens here

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000
And we're going to keep things rolling for the podcast

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
So just bear with us

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000
This is what happens when you tape a show live

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000
So we're going to disconnect right now

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000
And so

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000
Haha the live listeners can't hear us right now

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000
Are there any live listeners you want to talk smack about while we're doing this?

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000
Smack smack smack smack

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000
Alright let's reconnect

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000
Alright so we're reconnected so we'll see

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000
If that hopefully helps the problem

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000
I don't know but everything otherwise

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000
Looks good on our end

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000
So it could be on the all games end as well

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000
I don't know

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000
So we'll see

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
Anyhow let's move on to some rapid fire news

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000
And all the quick little things that

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000
You know if we had a five hour show we could talk more about

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
Loki

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000
Why don't you start us off

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000
Let's see so

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000
There's some interesting stuff here

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
We'll start with

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000
Of course

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
Something from Dragon Quest 9

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
And there was something you mentioned

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
Robin I don't think it was Dragon Quest

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000
It was um

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000
Oh I remember now

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000
It was 3D Dot Game Heroes

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000
There was like uh

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000
Foo Foo or something like that

01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.000
It was insinuated like you know sex or something

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000
Yes that is um

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000
It's one of the towns you go in and yeah

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000
You can buy Foo Foo from somebody

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000
For like ten dollars and it makes you

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000
It's very very uh

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
Well anyways

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000
Apparently Dragon Quest

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000
Um

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000
I guess this is uh

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000
Yeah Dragon Quest 9

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000
There's something you can um

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000
Purchase I guess

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
It's Poof Poof

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000
Or Puff Puff

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
I guess Puff Puff Performance

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
Is a quest you can unlock

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000
And um

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000
Apparently Puff Puff is

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000
Interesting because

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000
Obviously this is an

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000
E10 game there is

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000
No sex involved

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000
But uh Puff Puff I guess is coming

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000
I read this

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000
It's uh

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000
It comes from the Japanese word

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000
I guess uh

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000
Pafu Pafu

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000
Which I guess is supposed to represent the sound

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000
Of rubbing

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000
One's breasts and another person's face

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000
And that's kind of like what happens

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.000
In this thing

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000
This French woman

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000
With large breasts

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000
Um convinces the player to sit down

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000
In a chair and she blindfolds him

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000
And then she proceeds to

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
Perform Puff Puff on him

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000
Of course funny enough

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
It's not really her breasts rubbing against his face

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
But it's two slimes against his face

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000
But still

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000
Kind of scandalous

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
A little bit

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000
Is that really the sound that makes Pafu Pafu?

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000
Is that what they said?

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000
I don't know. Jamie could you come over here

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000
For a minute?

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
Sure

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000
We have an experiment we need to try

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000
Okay we're gonna put the microphone right there

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
It didn't sound very Pafu Pafu

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000
Like

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000
Boobs what do you have to say?

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000
They don't say anything

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000
They just sit there and look pretty

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000
Apparently

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
Apparently it's in the game and it's funny

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
They had a funny video of it as well

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000
Online and it's very um

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000
Filled with

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000
Induendo

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
Yeah but E10

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000
It'd be different if it was a mature raid game

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000
Um

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000
Red Faction Battlegrounds

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
Has been announced for Xbox Live Arcade

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000
And the Playstation Network

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
By THQ Digital

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000
Is gonna be a prequel to

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000
Red Faction Armageddon

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000
And if

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000
I should say if THQ has it their way

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000
They want to put the game out for free

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000
Or close to free as possible

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000
Perhaps as a preorder

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000
Like

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000
Incentive for ordering

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
Red Faction Armageddon

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
So that sounds kind of cool

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000
Um

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000
And is expected to come out sometime

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
In 2011 probably

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
3 or 4 months before the game is released

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
Or Red Faction Armageddon is released

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
Um

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
So that's interesting

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
And then finally

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000
If you're a fan of music games

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000
And who isn't

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000
There is a brand new browser based music game

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000
You can check out called

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000
Instant Jam

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000
It comes from Instant Action

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
And it's a game that looks very similar

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000
To say like a Guitar Hero

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000
Um

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000
You know one of those games where you have

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000
It sounds like a very instant kind of company

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000
Yeah like the no highway and you know the

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000
Different things coming down

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000
Apparently it supports your own music library

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000
Um and it also supports

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000
Keyboard or USB guitar

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
Controllers and allows for

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
In game music purchases as well through

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000
Amazon or iTunes

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000
Um I guess it's a version of download content

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000
And uh

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000
There is a beta currently available through Facebook

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000
And versions um

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000
I guess playable through the website

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000
And embedded elsewhere

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
Will be rolled out soon

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000
Alright

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000
Well let's move on with some other

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
Stories here and I want to talk about

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000
Speaking of music games, Dance Central

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000
Has some new songs announced for it

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000
Ten more songs announced this week

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000
Nelly Furtado with Man Eater

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000
Basement Jax with

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000
Rendezvous

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000
Benny Benassi with Satisfaction

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000
Nina Sky with Move Ya Body

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
Cascada with Evacuate the Dance Floor

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000
Pitbull with I Know You Want Me

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
Calle Ocho

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000
I know you want me

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000
I know I want ya

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.000
Sounds like Strong Bad singing

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.000
Fanny Pack with

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000
Too bad it's not the

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000
Fanny Pack song, Camel Toe

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000
But it's Hey Mammy

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000
Mammy? M-A-M-Y

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000
Mammy? Mammy is

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000
M-O-M-M-Y

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000
Depends on if it's a name

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000
Or another language

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000
Roriana has Pond to Replay

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000
Cool and the Gang

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000
Jungle Boogie

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000
Technotronic with Pump Up the Jam

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000
And Kylie Minogue

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000
with Can't Get You Out of My Head

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000
That was a fun song when it was in DDR

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000
like years and years ago

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000
I was going to say there were some

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000
other songs as well

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000
I can confirm that are going to be in the game

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000
In fact I'm looking

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000
Oh is it the whole lyric spill thing that happened?

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.000
No, no, not even

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000
More scandalous than that

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000
This is

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000
This is Wonderful People

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.000
Shouldn't be in places that they are

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000
Are they naughty people that have already gotten copies

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000
of the game somehow? They're naughty people that have

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000
gotten copies of the beta that's on

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000
Partner Net right now

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000
Of course they can't play anything because

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000
it requires a Kinect camera but

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000
doesn't mean that they won't know

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000
what songs are on there

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.000
and included in there

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000
I'm not sure if these have been already announced

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000
Lady Gaga's Poker Face

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.000
Lips Ink, Mouth to Mouth

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000
M-I-A, Arlor

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000
No Doubt, Rock Steady

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000
Bell Biv Devoe, Poison

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
and BC Boy's Body Moving, the Fat Boy Slim remix

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000
A few of those were already out there

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000
but I don't remember the M-I-A song being announced

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000
that's news to me

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000
Interesting

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000
Alright

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000
Well we'll see if

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000
what the song list looks like anyway

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000
I'm sure not too much longer

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.000
we'll have the full song list announced

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000
I'll probably give you about ten songs a week till it's all out there

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.000
Anyhow, how about Toy Story 3

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000
Yeah it's not just a movie

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000
it's a game as well

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:21.000
The game is out there, it's on the Wii I'm sure

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.000
It's also on the Xbox 360 and the Playstation 3

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.000
In fact the Playstation 3

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000
is taking the opportunity of

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000
having this unique hybrid premium

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.000
edition

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.000
So there is actually a new version out there

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.000
of Toy Story 3 bundled with

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000
the original Toy Story movie

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:39.000
on a single Blu-ray disc

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.000
for 6499

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.000
So it's interesting

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000
that it's not just like a combo

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000
pack, but it's actually

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000
both things were put onto one

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000
disc for 65 bucks

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.000
Interesting

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.000
Yeah

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:57.000
But sadly

01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:59.000
it's not both Toy Story and Toy Story 2

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000
otherwise that would be a really killer deal

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000
but what about Toy Story 2?

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.000
What about that?

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.000
What about it?

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000
Dartatouille is correcting me saying it was Love at First Sight

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000
that was in Max 2 US

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.000
Can't Get You Out of My Head, I was really close

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:15.000
That was in one of the US ones

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.000
I thought Can't Get You Out of My Head wasn't one of the US ones

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.000
Oh well, whatever

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.000
Anyhow, how about something non-music

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:23.000
game related, how about an MMO

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000
but this is not the type of MMO you'd think

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000
It is related to Disney though

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000
Disney Pixar has a game called World

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000
of Cars online

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000
and of course you know in the Disney MMOs

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.000
you may have heard of this, you can't type in

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.000
your own stuff, you have to use the pre-selected

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000
phrases and things that have been selected

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.000
for you, well one of the other things

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000
you can do in the game is that you can pick your own car number

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000
because of course you're playing race cars

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000
so you can have whatever car number you want

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.000
except for 69

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.000
you cannot be car

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.000
69 in the car's MMO

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000
Can you be car 420?

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:57.000
No, because the cars only have two digits

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.000
but you could be car 54 and you could be like

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.000
where are you?

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.000
old joke

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000
I liked that show, it had the dude that played

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:07.000
Herman Munster

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:09.000
There you go, so yeah when you're selecting

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.000
apparently when you're in the game selecting the number for your car

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.000
if you go like, you select each

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.000
digit one at a time, so if you select

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000
4, 5, 7, then you see

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000
1 through 9 is the next digit, but when you

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:21.000
select 6, it only goes 0 through 8

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000
so, interesting

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.000
World of Cars

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.000
online is free, worldofcars.go.com

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.000
you can sign up for free

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000
but it is a

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000
$5.95 a month subscription

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000
if you want to get all the features

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000
of World of Cars

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000
that will not unlock car number 69

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000
no just so you know, not even if you

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.000
pay for it

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000
Dark Sakura

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.000
Well how about some

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000
something different, something in the

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.000
Squeenix direction, remember we talked about

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.000
Gun Loco?

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.000
Well it turns out it's a game about

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:57.000
a planet full of criminals

01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:59.000
they're all crazy

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:01.000
crazy crazy crazy criminals with guns

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.000
and the world's sort of like

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.000
an earthish ruin

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.000
type place and there's different

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.000
factions and they're always fighting

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.000
so

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.000
it looks

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:15.000
completely hilarious

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000
I think I would really really

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.000
like to play it

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.000
all the characters were done by

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:23.000
Kenny Wong and basically made

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.000
toys of everything and then they scanned

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:27.000
them into the game so that's how the design

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:29.000
come about, so that's pretty cool

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.000
and then

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.000
for Rock Band we have the Disturbed

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:35.000
Pack

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:37.000
that's going to be on August

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:39.000
24th a couple days

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.000
from now, the Disturbed Pack has another

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.000
way to die, Asylum and the Animal

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.000
and then

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.000
there's Universal Motown Republic

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:49.000
Rock Pack which is Crash King's

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:51.000
Mountain Man, the Vir Union

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:53.000
Seasons and We Are the Fallen Bury

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:55.000
Me Alive

01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:57.000
also

01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.000
only one of those is available in

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.000
Lego Rock Band and that is the Vir Union

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.000
Seasons and lastly

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.000
the big Horkan grocery

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.000
store chain in England

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.000
called Tesco, you've

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000
heard of them I'm sure

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.000
No, because they don't have them here

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:15.000
Actually, they do

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:17.000
There's a company called Fresh and Easy

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.000
that's a

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:21.000
Tesco chain in the United States

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:23.000
Still, I don't think I've ever

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.000
been to one, but okay

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.000
Let's just be opening a couple

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:29.000
in Sacramento

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.000
but anyway

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000
it's like a big grocery store chain

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:35.000
anyway, they are now

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000
going to be buying

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.000
used games

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000
you will be paid in credit and then you

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.000
can buy whatever you need in the grocery store

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:45.000
so

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:47.000
basically they're saying

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.000
for Red Dead Redemption you'll get

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:51.000
a £19 trade in

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:53.000
Mario Kart for Wii gets £19

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:55.000
FIFA 2010 gets

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:57.000
£12, that type of thing

01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:59.000
and then they're going to resell the

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:01.000
stores at other outlets

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:03.000
and already

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:05.000
about 60 Tesco stores

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:07.000
accept them

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:09.000
Everybody wants a piece of that industry

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:11.000
Now when someone says they have to pick

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.000
between video games and food, if money's

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.000
certain, they can literally

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.000
I had to give up

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.000
Red Dead Redemption, but I got some

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.000
Top Ramen, awesome

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.000
Alright, let's get into some Twitter

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.000
topics tonight. Every week you guys

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000
submit us topics at www.

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:29.000
twitter.com slash o-l-r

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000
and we pick a few of our

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:33.000
favorite topics and read through them here on the show

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:35.000
and sadly

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:37.000
I seem to be without my music tonight

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:39.000
What did I do?

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:41.000
I broke it all

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:43.000
Well, I guess Twitter topics cancelled because I don't have

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:45.000
theme songs. I blame Rob, I blame Rob

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:47.000
Live Radio

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.000
You just want to

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:51.000
sing the theme song tonight?

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:53.000
Oh, thank god we're all

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:55.000
saved, alright

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:57.000
Twitter.com slash o-l-r

01:57:57.000 --> 01:58:03.000
Let's see who tweeted us this week here

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:07.000
Redtertainment sends us a tweet

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:09.000
says, o-l-r, is there a video game

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.000
equivalent of Rocky Horror?

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:13.000
You mean a game so bad

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.000
that it's kind of good?

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:17.000
Actually, I'll say this, there really was

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:19.000
There was a Rocky Horror show game

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:21.000
There was one of them back in the 80's

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:23.000
on the Apple 2e and the Commodore 64

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:25.000
I believe had a version

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:27.000
and you actually went around the castle

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:29.000
getting parts of Frank N Furter's laser

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:31.000
or something like that, you could play as Brad or Janet

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:33.000
I remember, and then they made a CD

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:35.000
That sounds rather Maniac Mansion

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:37.000
It was kind of inspired by that

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:39.000
There was a CD-ROM based one in the

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:41.000
mid 90's for one of the big

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:43.000
UK revivals and it actually

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:45.000
had like, back when full motion video was in

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:47.000
every CD-ROM game, they actually had a

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:49.000
Rocky Horror show game there, but it was released

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:51.000
I think exclusively in the UK, so I never played it

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:53.000
I don't know if people out there did

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:55.000
but that would be it

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:57.000
What about a game so bad it's kind of good?

01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:59.000
How about not taking the question so literally

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:01.000
and a game so bad

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:03.000
it's kind of good?

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:05.000
Like, I think about Loki and how he talks about

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:07.000
Driver 3 all the time, that it's so terrible

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:09.000
that it's actually kind of fun

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:11.000
Earth Defense Force 2017

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:13.000
It's a very terrible game

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:15.000
but it's very fun

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:17.000
I think back in the day for me it was

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:19.000
Abadox

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:21.000
I don't know if I can think of one

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:23.000
that I really go, gosh that game

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:25.000
is so bad that I just love it for some reason

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:27.000
Anything come to your mind now?

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:29.000
Think of?

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:31.000
I'm not sure if I'm thinking of

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:33.000
terrible or just really difficult

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:35.000
but Battletoads?

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:37.000
I thought of one

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:39.000
I thought of one, a game that we actually played

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:41.000
on end because it was so awful

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:43.000
What's that?

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:45.000
Batman 3

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:47.000
It had the butt monkey in it

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:49.000
Seriously, it had this

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:51.000
like a baboon, so it had the big exposed

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:53.000
butt, and it would fly

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:55.000
its butt at people

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:57.000
and then there was this one guy who his

01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:59.000
taunt was shooting people

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:01.000
He could just take damage off by

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:03.000
taunting, just shoot

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:05.000
bang, and it was so bad

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:07.000
and the voice acting was so horrible

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:09.000
and even to this day when

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:11.000
I'm hanging out with Mystique and we see a monkey

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:13.000
we'll go butt monkey dance

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:15.000
butt monkey dance

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:17.000
because he danced when he won

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:19.000
Tigerclaw

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:21.000
leave it to him to have the Google Foos

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:23.000
skills to find more information

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:25.000
The Rocky Interactive Horror

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:27.000
Show game was released in March

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.000
April 1999

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:31.000
it was later than I thought

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:33.000
for the PC by Online PLC

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:35.000
Similarly to the earlier CRL game

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:37.000
the player plays as Brad or Janet

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:39.000
and must rescue their partner from the castle

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:41.000
unlike the older computer game

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:43.000
its gameplay was more puzzle oriented

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:45.000
and benefited from the added detail, graphics

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:47.000
and live video sequences that the PC could provide

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:49.000
Was Frank-N-Furter in it though?

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:51.000
because if Frank-N-Furter

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:53.000
is not in it, I mean Tim Curry

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:55.000
single handedly makes

02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:57.000
that movie, he does

02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:59.000
The screams of

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:01.000
thousands of people when Frank-N-Furter

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:03.000
first shows up in the movie, tell me so

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:05.000
Alright, anyhow

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:07.000
Let's see, other tweets

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:09.000
that we have Twitter.com

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:11.000
Tigerclaw

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:13.000
sends us a link about an Italian city

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:15.000
that's pissed at Gran Turismo 5

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:17.000
Now why would you be angry at Gran Turismo 5?

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:19.000
Well apparently

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:21.000
Siena is a

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:23.000
city in Tuscany, Italy

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:25.000
They're very unhappy that

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:27.000
one of their, I guess

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:29.000
famous roads, the Piazza Del Campo

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:31.000
is actually a race course in

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:33.000
Gran Turismo 5's kart mode

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:35.000
They want it removed in the game

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:37.000
The road is

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:39.000
in the game or the structures or what have you

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:41.000
It's also

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:43.000
I'm just trying to

02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:45.000
see what it is here

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:47.000
Sorry, when we get things from Twitter

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:49.000
we haven't had a chance to look at them in advance

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:51.000
or whatever

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:53.000
I guess because it's also partially

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:55.000
a horse race, oh I see

02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:57.000
the Piazza Del Campo is also

02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:59.000
the name of a famous horse racing track

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:01.000
So I guess they don't want people to kind of get

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:03.000
confused over what's going on there

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:05.000
So they've sent out a quote

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:07.000
diplomatic request to Sony

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:09.000
to resolve the matter

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:11.000
This game is coming out very soon though

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:13.000
so I don't know if it's going to be able to be fixed

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:15.000
unless they patch it out

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:17.000
because that's how they fix everything these days, right?

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:21.000
Let's see

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:23.000
I'll read this one too from Tiger Claw

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:25.000
We give everybody at least two tweets

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:27.000
So Tiger Claw says it's this tweet

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:29.000
Disney Online hits a traffic high

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:31.000
with 36 million monthly

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:33.000
visitors, wow

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:35.000
How much are on Facebook?

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:37.000
How much of that's on Facebook? They don't really get their

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:39.000
users through Facebook, do they?

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:41.000
But they do Club Penguin

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:43.000
You've seen those Club Penguin cards at Target

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:45.000
and all those other stores. That's probably their biggest game there

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:47.000
They also have Toontown Online

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:49.000
Disney Fairies Pixie Hollow

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:51.000
I didn't even know there was a Disney Fairies Pixie Hollow

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:53.000
There you go

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:55.000
So lots and lots of games that Disney has

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:57.000
They've hit quite a milestone there

02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:59.000
Never played one of them

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:01.000
I love Penguins too

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:03.000
I don't know why I've never played Club Penguin

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:05.000
but I just haven't

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:07.000
DJ Blazekin sends us a variety of stories

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:09.000
Some of them we're going to be talking about earlier or later

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:11.000
But this one I don't think goes on our showroll

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:13.000
This has to do with other Blizzard stuff

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:15.000
Big things planned for Diablo 3

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:17.000
at this year's BlizzCon

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:19.000
Apparently there is big Diablo 3 news coming out

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:21.000
at BlizzCon this year

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:23.000
It's going to be split into three games

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:25.000
No, let's hope not

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:27.000
I guess this is coming out of

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:29.000
Gamescom. It's the games director

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:31.000
Jay Wilson saying

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:33.000
I can say that this BlizzCon

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:35.000
in terms of Diablo news

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:37.000
will be the biggest one that we've ever had

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:39.000
Well it's probably because that's the game they're going to focus most on

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:41.000
because by that point we ought to know the release date

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:43.000
for Cataclysm

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:45.000
and it'll be out either just before or just after

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:47.000
Did they even have BlizzCon back in

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:49.000
Diablo 2 days?

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:51.000
No, they didn't

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:53.000
Of course it's going to be the one they've had the most time

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:55.000
I don't know what the hell that means

02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:57.000
They're going to reveal another playable class in the game

02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:59.000
They say there's only going to be one more

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:01.000
a fifth class and they've announced all the others

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:03.000
Cheerleader

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:05.000
Let's hope. Maybe they'll release a peripheral

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:07.000
for the keyboard like they had on

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:09.000
We Cheer. That'd be great

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:11.000
We'll see what happens

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:15.000
You know what's really interesting though about that is that

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:17.000
with Starcraft 2 having had

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:19.000
the digital distribution day one

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:21.000
but Diablo 3 is going to have that too

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:23.000
so I wonder if it's really going to have that big

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:25.000
midnight launch or what have you

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:27.000
I don't know

02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:29.000
Let's see. Anyhow

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:31.000
Oh dear

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:33.000
We're getting linked to this by ActDeft

02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:35.000
and I just see Furries in the title

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:37.000
so I'm worried about this

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:39.000
He links this to a story from Kotaku that says

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:41.000
Microsoft Connect supports Furries

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:43.000
and it's got a video on it

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:45.000
Do I want to see this?

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:47.000
We know what you're thinking

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:49.000
Will Microsoft Connect read your body

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:51.000
when fully encased in a fur suit?

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:55.000
And again this is coming from Kotaku I guess

02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:59.000
Yes and sure enough somebody is dancing there

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:01.000
in a full kitty costume there

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:03.000
to Dance Central

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:05.000
Thank you ActDeft

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:07.000
for wasting 30 seconds of my life

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:09.000
I will never be able to get back

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:11.000
So at Dragon Con over Labor Day weekend

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:13.000
they can yiff

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:15.000
in the privacy of their hotel rooms

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:17.000
or they can get their gaga on

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:19.000
Bobby's going to Dragon Con

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:21.000
I hope he's still listening

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:23.000
Bobby I would really like to request

02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:25.000
a full furry report

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:27.000
on the furry scene

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:29.000
at Dragon Con

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:31.000
Bring some Purell

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:33.000
I'd say bring the candle

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:35.000
I saw

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:37.000
DarkKusuke sends us a tweet on Twitter

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:39.000
saying that Star Wars Clone Wars

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:41.000
Open Beta opened today

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:43.000
Really I did not know that

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:45.000
A lot of these big games

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:47.000
coming out the Christmas season

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:49.000
I guess are having their betas open up

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:51.000
When's the DC Universe one open up?

02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:53.000
That's the one I really want to play

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:55.000
Really bad

02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:57.000
And lastly Alex P. Carson tweets us

02:05:57.000 --> 02:05:59.000
saying does anybody know the official name

02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:01.000
of the Super Mario version of M.I.A.

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:03.000
Paper Planes that was on the Afterbirth

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:05.000
a while back

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:07.000
That's making me think

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:09.000
There's a website that has tons of chiptunes

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:11.000
and I can't think of the name of it right now

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:13.000
but hopefully somebody in chat will remember

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:15.000
and we found it on there

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:17.000
and I bet if you search for Paper Planes

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:19.000
you could find it

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:21.000
There's some huge chiptunes website

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:23.000
and I can't remember the name of it

02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:25.000
like it totally escapes me right now

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:27.000
Somebody in chat will remember what it is

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:29.000
It's like it's just a bunch of homegrown stuff

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:31.000
and if you like that you'll probably like a lot of the stuff that's on there

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:33.000
So hopefully somebody in chat will shout it out here soon

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:35.000
If not I'll Google it in a minute

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:37.000
I'll find it

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:39.000
Let me Google that for you

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:41.000
Alright that's gonna do it for Twitter Topics tonight

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:43.000
Don't miss tweets in the future

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:45.000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:47.000
In the meantime while I try to figure out

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:49.000
what song that was

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:51.000
Loki

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:53.000
This week both the Guitar Hero

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:55.000
Warriors of Rock tracklist

02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:57.000
and Rock Band

02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:59.000
3 tracklists

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:01.000
were revealed

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:03.000
and it's interesting

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:05.000
because there's definitely a lot of stuff to go over

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:07.000
So let's start off

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:09.000
with Guitar Hero

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:11.000
Warriors of Rock

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:13.000
There's gonna be 93 tracks

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:15.000
I'm not gonna go through all of these

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:17.000
But some of the ones I thought were interesting

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:19.000
Rush 2112

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:21.000
They have all 7 parts of it

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:23.000
That's kind of neat I guess

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:25.000
Let's see

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:27.000
What are some of the ones that stood out to me

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:29.000
Rammstein

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:31.000
They've got a song from them

02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:33.000
Looks like

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:35.000
Wade Mann's Hyle

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:37.000
Let's see here

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:39.000
REM Losing My Religion

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:41.000
Queen Bohemian Rhapsody

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:43.000
Of course both games have that

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:45.000
awesome song

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:47.000
By the way there was a Queen

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:49.000
slot machine that I played in Reno

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:51.000
and it's the most amazing

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:53.000
gambling device I've ever played

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:55.000
The bonus

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:57.000
round it lets me pick a Queen song and then

02:07:57.000 --> 02:07:59.000
the game plays itself for free for like

02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:01.000
a minute while I sit there and listen to Radio Gaga

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:03.000
It's amazing

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:05.000
That's cool

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:07.000
Um

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:09.000
Let's see what other songs on here

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:11.000
Um

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:13.000
They've got like actually a bunch of

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:15.000
Just a bunch of everything

02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:17.000
About one song from each artist on here

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:19.000
Some of the ones I actually recognize

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:21.000
Let's see of course they have

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:23.000
Deep Purple, Burn

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:25.000
The

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:27.000
Queen's Clearwater Revival

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:29.000
Fortunate Son

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:31.000
Download content from

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:33.000
Rock Band 2

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:35.000
Foreigner feels like the first time

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:39.000
Um

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:41.000
By the way did you see

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:43.000
that video where they

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:45.000
fessed up that the Rock Band 3 leak was real

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:47.000
basically? Yeah they have the

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:49.000
Rock Band full track list behind

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:51.000
them. Yeah that was funny

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:53.000
Um anyway so yeah

02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:55.000
lots of stuff, ballista's out there

02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:57.000
Um

02:08:57.000 --> 02:08:59.000
Looks pretty cool

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:01.000
And of course Rock Band 3

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:03.000
Uh we've got

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:05.000
Let's see here

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:07.000
Lots of things from there

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:09.000
Um their track list is

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:11.000
a little bit smaller but of course you get all the download content

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:13.000
from Rock Band 2 and

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:15.000
all the tracks from that and anything else

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:17.000
you pretty much have bought

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:19.000
So starting off with that

02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:21.000
They have Amy Winehouse in

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:23.000
Rehab but I didn't really think of that as a rock

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:25.000
song but okay

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:27.000
Um

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:29.000
They of course uh let's see here

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:31.000
Devo, Whip It

02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:33.000
They have Imagine by John Lennon though

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:35.000
Which I don't think of as a rock song

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:37.000
But I think that's a sweet

02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:39.000
addition to the game. Hell yeah

02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:41.000
Um one of course I was excited about

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:43.000
when they first announced it

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:45.000
Huey Lewis and the News, The Power of Love

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:47.000
Just need back time now

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:49.000
Perfect

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:51.000
I heard that song a ton at E3, that was in the E3 build

02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:53.000
Um

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:55.000
Leonard Skynyrd Freebird

02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:57.000
Of course on there

02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:59.000
Marilyn Manson, The Beautiful People

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:01.000
Ozzy Osbourne,

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:03.000
Crazy Train

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:05.000
I know they had another Rammstein song on here

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:07.000
Duhost

02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:09.000
Which is pretty cool. Not pussy

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:11.000
Is it in German?

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:13.000
If it is in German that would be great

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:15.000
I have to sort of digress

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:17.000
Why not? That's what we do here on this show

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:19.000
One of the E3 trips, all the DDR Freak

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:21.000
moderators got together and went to the Korean

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:23.000
karaoke place and Duhost was on there

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:25.000
and we were all

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:27.000
singing Duhost in our worst Rammstein

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:29.000
German voices

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:31.000
Duhost mich!

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:33.000
Oh that is great

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:35.000
Um you know Police Don't Stand So Close

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:37.000
to Me

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:39.000
They also had

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:41.000
I hate this song

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:43.000
Smash Mouth Walkin' on the Sun

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:45.000
The Sounds Livin' in America

02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:47.000
At least it's not that

02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:49.000
Hey now, you're an all-star

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:51.000
It's Avon, get paid

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:53.000
I think that was in Lego Rock Band

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:55.000
I hate that song

02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:57.000
Um

02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:59.000
Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:01.000
I need to know

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:03.000
Curse of Fears, Everybody Wants to Rule the World

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:05.000
Lots of cool stuff

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:07.000
I'm just looking forward to actually being able to play

02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:09.000
a lot of these songs with the keyboard

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:11.000
Which would be really sweet

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:13.000
I really hope they go back and add keyboard support

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:15.000
for some of the old classic download songs

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:17.000
Yeah I don't know if they're gonna but

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:19.000
They need to

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:21.000
They really need to

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:23.000
Just sayin'

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:25.000
Oh of course they have Deep Purple, Smoke on the Water

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:27.000
Probably the better at Deep Purple song if you ask me

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:29.000
Alright

02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:31.000
By the way, just to answer that tweet from a few minutes ago

02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:33.000
Finally found the answer there

02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:35.000
We're using my Google FU

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:37.000
The listener's in chatroom and found it already

02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:39.000
But just for anybody else who's listening

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:41.000
The artist's name is CSLSX

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:43.000
And the website I was trying to think of

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:45.000
8Bit Collective

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:47.000
Which is actually a really good website for a bunch of chiptunes

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:49.000
The number 8, not spelled out

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:51.000
Actually the number 8, bc.org

02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:53.000
And you can get all these NES chiptunes

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:05.000
Actually that was like the worst possible clip

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:07.000
of the song I could play for you guys

02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:09.000
But it's not bad, go check it out

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:13.000
More news for you guys

02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:15.000
This is about a new peripheral

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:17.000
Which I find kind of interesting

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:19.000
You don't see a whole lot of these

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:21.000
3rd party peripherals, or at least you're not used to

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:23.000
You start seeing more now, like you know

02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:25.000
DDR mats, and rock band guitars

02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:27.000
And so forth, this is something a little new

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:29.000
THQ is putting out a new game tablet

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:31.000
For the Wii, it's like a drawing

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:33.000
Tablet that you

02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:35.000
It's actually kind of like a combination, you put the Wii mode in there

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:37.000
And then you have actually this little tablet

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:39.000
It's called UDraw

02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:41.000
It's a 4x6 inch tablet

02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:43.000
And it's going to be coming out for the Wii

02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:45.000
And it will be coming out for $70

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:47.000
And it comes with UDraw Studio

02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:49.000
It's a drawing, coloring, and art based

02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:51.000
video game, which I think is kind of cool

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:53.000
Mario Paint! It's Mario Paint basically

02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:55.000
And how long have we been saying they need to do

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:57.000
Mario Paint on the Wii, so

02:12:57.000 --> 02:12:59.000
THQ is kind of doing it the way it ought to be done

02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:01.000
And what I love too is that one of the promotional

02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:03.000
shots here for the game

02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:05.000
Is somebody who has drawn

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:07.000
Wait for it, I'm trying to bring it up here in the studio

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:09.000
They've actually drawn on the screen, oh damn

02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:11.000
It's a unicorn, somebody drew a unicorn

02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:13.000
But unicorn works too

02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:15.000
I'm wondering if there would be some way

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:17.000
They're going to make an adapter to use it on the PC or something

02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:19.000
Because it's definitely

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:21.000
cheaper than buying a Bluetooth

02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:23.000
Adapter

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:25.000
In the end though, I mean

02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:27.000
I paid $400 for my tablet

02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:29.000
And

02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:31.000
I can use Photoshop

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:33.000
But Jamie, can you draw that

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:35.000
bitchin' unicorn? I could draw that unicorn

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:37.000
right now

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:39.000
It just got a hit on Apple a little bit

02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:41.000
But the fact that the Wii has a proper

02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:43.000
tablet means that it's more of an iPad than the

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:45.000
iPad is

02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:47.000
There you go

02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:49.000
Look, I'm drawing a unicorn right now

02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:51.000
Yay

02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:53.000
Actually, you know what, we've been

02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:55.000
needing new album art for Orange Lounge Radio

02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:57.000
And I'm still waiting on those pictures

02:13:57.000 --> 02:13:59.000
Well I think it should be, you took one of me like

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:01.000
years ago, anyway

02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:03.000
No, I think we should just have a giant unicorn

02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:05.000
In the album art

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:07.000
Speaking of unicorns, and I know I'm a little bit

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:09.000
behind in times because I used to check

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:11.000
their YouTube feed every now and then

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:13.000
They have a new Charlie

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:15.000
the Unicorn, except it's not Charlie the Unicorn

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:17.000
It's Charlie

02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:19.000
Teh-Unicron

02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:21.000
And it's like these remixed versions of

02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:23.000
the Charlie the Unicorn episodes

02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:25.000
And it was hilarious because they burned

02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:27.000
down the forest

02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:29.000
Candy Mountain

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:31.000
Alright, anyway

02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:33.000
Some other games that are coming out

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:35.000
That's not the only game coming out as the Mario

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:37.000
Paint-ish clone

02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:39.000
U-Draw will also be getting launch games

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:41.000
Pictionary, because you know, you gotta have more

02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:43.000
of the board games on the Wii

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:45.000
And Dude's Big Adventure, that's D-O-O-D

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:47.000
Like, doodle

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:49.000
He, dude

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:51.000
Dude's Big Adventure, it's a world where coloring

02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:53.000
books come to life

02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:55.000
Apparently it's heavily inspired by the game

02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:57.000
Drawn to Life, which was also a THQ game

02:14:57.000 --> 02:14:59.000
So they're just kinda like, you know, getting themselves there

02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:01.000
I'm sure the next

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:03.000
Drawn to Life game will support this as well

02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:05.000
We'll see

02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:07.000
There's your damn unicorn

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:09.000
I can't hold the pen very well

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:11.000
I can't hold my stylus very well to control my

02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:13.000
Can you put a picture of that up on orangeontradar.com?

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:15.000
Alright, awesome

02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:17.000
Okay

02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:19.000
Awesome

02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:21.000
So yeah, U-Draw, I don't know, is anyone in here

02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:23.000
interested in U-Draw? I guess Dark Soccer made

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:25.000
a pretty good case for it, if it would work on the PC

02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:27.000
Nope

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:29.000
Yeah, I'm not really interested either, but I do want an iPad

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:31.000
Nope

02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:33.000
I think a lot of

02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:35.000
dinner parties have ended in divorce

02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:37.000
due to bad rounds of Pictionary

02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:39.000
And I'm glad that that experience can come

02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:41.000
now, come to the Wii

02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:43.000
To a whole new generation

02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:45.000
Dark Soccer, I hate to tear you away from

02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:47.000
unicorn drawing, but there is more gaming news

02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:49.000
to be talked about tonight, correct?

02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:51.000
The Doctor

02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:53.000
Doctor Who, there's going to be a third

02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:55.000
game

02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:57.000
Oh, well, a third episode

02:15:57.000 --> 02:15:59.000
of Doctor Who, the adventure games

02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:01.000
This one's called TARDIS

02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:03.000
And you get to fly the TARDIS

02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:05.000
It'll be out on the

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:07.000
27th of August, and

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:09.000
the whole thing is that you have to

02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:11.000
explore the entire TARDIS

02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:13.000
And the TARDIS is freaking big

02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:15.000
Remember, it's bigger on the inside

02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:17.000
And

02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:19.000
then you can fly the TARDIS

02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:21.000
So, that's pretty cool

02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:23.000
You know, it's basically

02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:25.000
overcoming 40 years

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:27.000
of what's it like to pilot the TARDIS

02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:29.000
in one game

02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:31.000
Although, really, the TARDIS

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:33.000
is meant to be piloted by six people

02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:35.000
It should be a bullet hell game featuring the TARDIS

02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:37.000
The TARDIS can't shoot anything

02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:39.000
That sounds retard-ous

02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:41.000
Anyway, this one's featuring

02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:43.000
the 11th Doctor

02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:45.000
being Matt Smith

02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:47.000
and Amy Pond

02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:49.000
played by Karen Gillan

02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:51.000
So, pretty cool

02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:53.000
And it's free!

02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:55.000
For all you people in the UK

02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:57.000
Oh yeah, don't we have to pay for it though?

02:16:57.000 --> 02:16:59.000
Because the Brits get it subsidized with their television tax

02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:01.000
or whatever, but we have to actually pay for it

02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:03.000
Yeah, we don't have TV tax

02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:05.000
Lame

02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:07.000
I mean, great that we don't have TV tax

02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:09.000
Although, Comcast kind of, you know, sends me a

02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:11.000
TV tax bill every month, but I guess that's a whole

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:13.000
other issue

02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:15.000
You know I am going to be ditching cable TV though

02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:17.000
Well, with an HD receiver

02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:19.000
Like, I can just go get a good HD

02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:21.000
antenna for 50 bucks and I can get my basic

02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:23.000
channels, which is all I watch on cable

02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:25.000
So, why am I bothering?

02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:27.000
Although, I will say cable internet is where it's at

02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:29.000
My internet with them

02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:31.000
has actually gotten way faster recently

02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:33.000
Now I'm getting, you know, about

02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:35.000
I don't know what it ends up being

02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:37.000
with megabits, but I'm getting about

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:39.000
one and a half megabytes

02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:41.000
per second down

02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:43.000
I forgot the sparkles

02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:45.000
Thanks for downloading things really fast

02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:47.000
Plus, we got some more HD channels, so I've been watching

02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:49.000
Man vs. Food and

02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:51.000
Lots of Ninja Warrior

02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:53.000
I did notice a shit ton of new HD channels

02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:55.000
I watched six hours of

02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:57.000
Ninja Warrior straight one of these days

02:17:57.000 --> 02:17:59.000
because I had to wake up with

02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:01.000
Joshua, and he didn't want to go to sleep

02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:03.000
and I couldn't change channel

02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:05.000
But he didn't want to watch Ninja Warrior

02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:07.000
I watched Ninja Warrior, I watched like three seasons of it

02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:09.000
I like that you're teaching him young

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:11.000
Ninjas are awesome

02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:13.000
Will you be an equal opportunity household where

02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:15.000
pirates are also?

02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:17.000
If they have a cool pirate game show, then yes

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:19.000
We'll watch the pirate game show, but

02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:21.000
Right now it's just Ninja Warrior where it's at

02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:23.000
And then of course G4, you know, they have to do

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:25.000
the American Ninja Warrior

02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:27.000
And that just, that is about

02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:29.000
as bad as the stupid American Iron

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:31.000
Chef, and you know, I hated it

02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:33.000
a lot when it first

02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:35.000
came out over here, but

02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:37.000
now not so much

02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:39.000
Just because I don't think I have the Japanese one

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:41.000
to compare it to anymore

02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:43.000
Plus, Julie Chen

02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:45.000
is a judge a lot on Iron Chef America

02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:47.000
And I love Julie Chen, just saying

02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:51.000
Wait, what are we talking about now?

02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:53.000
You're ditching cable

02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:55.000
The Doctor Who game, that was it

02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:57.000
We got to the end of it, so it's all you, Logie

02:18:57.000 --> 02:18:59.000
I'm sorry, it was

02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:01.000
all these different tangents and I forgot which one

02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:03.000
I see you shopping on eBay over there, it's all good

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:05.000
Yeah, I know

02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:07.000
I don't even know what I'm looking for, I'm just looking

02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:09.000
Because that's what I do

02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:11.000
One of the things that's kind of funny

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:13.000
We were talking a little bit about different systems

02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:15.000
being hacked, well, something else

02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:17.000
that Microsoft had hoped wouldn't have been

02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:19.000
hacked, but it was, was the brand

02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:21.000
new Xbox 360

02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:23.000
system, the S slim, whatever

02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:25.000
the hell you want to call it, apparently

02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:27.000
the

02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:29.000
I guess, mod chip creation

02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:31.000
group

02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:33.000
Team Executor has been working

02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:35.000
closely with Team Jungle, who has created

02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:37.000
you know, drive firmwares

02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:39.000
for the original

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:41.000
Xbox 360 systems, and

02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:43.000
Commodore Forever, also

02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:45.000
responsible for

02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:47.000
firmwares for those systems and hacking

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:49.000
DVD drives, and now

02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:51.000
they have figured out a way

02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:53.000
to be able to patch

02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:55.000
the DVD rom on those new

02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:57.000
slim systems to

02:19:57.000 --> 02:19:59.000
play backups, so yes

02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:01.000
they have now created a new hacked

02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:03.000
firmware for that

02:20:03.000 --> 02:20:05.000
So

02:20:05.000 --> 02:20:07.000
They just keep

02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:09.000
trying, but they find ways around it

02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:11.000
But again, if you

02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:13.000
go online with it, bananated

02:20:13.000 --> 02:20:15.000
right? Um

02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:17.000
I'm not sure, because

02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:19.000
I would assume, yes, eventually you'll

02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:21.000
probably get banned, but

02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:23.000
the newer firmwares nowadays, they have

02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:25.000
light touch and stuff like that

02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:27.000
are apparently really

02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:29.000
stealthy, like it's very hard to detect

02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:31.000
them, so

02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:33.000
maybe? I don't know, I would assume

02:20:33.000 --> 02:20:35.000
eventually, yes, but then again

02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:37.000
I have a system at my work

02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:39.000
that was supposed to be modded

02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:41.000
and it hasn't been banned at all, then again

02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:43.000
we've not played one burned game on it, we just

02:20:43.000 --> 02:20:45.000
actually, it's funny, I bought it

02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:47.000
to replace another modded system, that's

02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:49.000
when we decided, hey, you know what, let's just play some

02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:51.000
normal Grand Theft Auto games instead of the modded ones

02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:53.000
Um, we will be playing the modded ones

02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:55.000
again, but we're not modifying our drive

02:20:55.000 --> 02:20:57.000
firmware, we're just doing disk swaps, so that

02:20:57.000 --> 02:20:59.000
even if they did detect, you know, that

02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:01.000
we were playing a modded game, when they look at the system

02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:03.000
the drive's not modded, so

02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:05.000
They can't ban me!

02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:07.000
Well, they can, but

02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:09.000
I would have

02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:11.000
a fighting chance

02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:15.000
Alright, you don't, you haven't

02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:17.000
had to play, you haven't had the opportunity to play

02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:19.000
around with one of the new 360 models, right?

02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:21.000
I don't really care, I mean

02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:23.000
it's neat that they changed, you know, the way

02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:25.000
it looks, and I like how it makes little noises and

02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:27.000
stuff when you click on the buttons

02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:29.000
Um, and apparently there's some like

02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:31.000
way, I, or, I remember

02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:33.000
now they're gonna have the new sim system

02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:35.000
with the Halo stuff

02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:37.000
and it's gonna have some different sound effects for that

02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:39.000
that's kinda neat, but

02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:41.000
yeah, I mean, I don't know

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:43.000
I wouldn't need one of these

02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:45.000
but, I don't know

02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:47.000
if someone gives one to me, I'm not gonna turn down

02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:49.000
Alright, well

02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:51.000
do you like to cut in line at big

02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:53.000
trade shows, or

02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:55.000
I guess not necessarily a trade show, but big conventions

02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:57.000
and uh, you know, have everybody hate you?

02:21:57.000 --> 02:21:59.000
Uh, well here you have your

02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:01.000
opportunity if you are a member of the gun club

02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:03.000
it's uh, Electronic Arts

02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:05.000
one of their uh, little promotional clubs

02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:07.000
they actually are running a promotion right now

02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:09.000
where you got an email

02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:11.000
and if you want, you can skip the line

02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:13.000
to see Dead Space 2 at Penny Arcade

02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:15.000
Expo, if you have a copy of the email

02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:17.000
that's right, you can skip the line with a printout

02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:19.000
of the email, and uh, Penny Arcade

02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:21.000
Expo's coming up in a couple weeks, that same

02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:23.000
Labor Day weekend that we're thinking of doing a long show

02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:25.000
and uh, there you go, you print out the email

02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:27.000
now why hasn't somebody just put the email online

02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:29.000
and then you just mass

02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:31.000
print it and then go, maybe there's like a barcode

02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:33.000
on it or something we're not seeing, I don't know

02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:35.000
probably, no, I don't think that's the case

02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:37.000
I think it's just people don't want to do that

02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:39.000
so that, you know, the line for that is

02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:41.000
really long, why would they, well

02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:43.000
it's gonna have the same line anyway, you know

02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:45.000
it's, exactly, and you know

02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:47.000
what, and it, it does suck, but then

02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:49.000
again, it's their booth space that they're, they

02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:51.000
paid for, they can do whatever the hell they want

02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:53.000
it's a strange precedent to be setting

02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:55.000
I mean, I, the only weird

02:22:55.000 --> 02:22:57.000
oddity about it for me is that, you know, and I

02:22:57.000 --> 02:22:59.000
made a big mistake calling it a trade show earlier

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:01.000
because it's not, but PAX is more of a

02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:03.000
convention, and I always thought one of the things

02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:05.000
that was supposed to kind of separate it is that

02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:07.000
everybody was on equal footing, like media

02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:09.000
doesn't get special treatment there, you're not

02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:11.000
supposed to be doing all these like media appointments

02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:13.000
and things, like that's what E3 is for, even though

02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:15.000
especially the years that E3

02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:17.000
went to

02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:19.000
the airport

02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:21.000
in Santa Monica or wherever it was, PAX

02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:23.000
kind of started to get a little more of that

02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:25.000
uh, where, you know, you could get in early if you

02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:27.000
were media and so forth, but I always thought PAX was supposed to be

02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:29.000
this place where everybody's on equal ground

02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:31.000
so, then, why

02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:33.000
is it now that some people are

02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:35.000
special, but of course, you know, again, it's

02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:37.000
this company, their email list, they're just

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:39.000
trying to pimp the service, the gun club

02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:41.000
they're trying to pimp it to make it have some values

02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:43.000
so that people can sign up for it

02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:45.000
I don't remember if it costs anything, I think it's just

02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:47.000
I know you, like, for example, if you buy that

02:23:47.000 --> 02:23:49.000
Battlefield Ultimate, uh, you know, Battlefield

02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:51.000
Bad Company 2 Ultimate Edition or whatever

02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:53.000
you get membership into the gun club

02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:55.000
I don't remember if it costs anything

02:23:55.000 --> 02:23:57.000
initially to sign up or whatever

02:23:57.000 --> 02:23:59.000
but you get, like, you know, into the Medal of Honor

02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:01.000
beta, um, early

02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:03.000
and stuff like that, so it's little

02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:05.000
tidbits of that kind of thing that are supposed to

02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:07.000
I guess they're making it worthwhile

02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:09.000
but, um

02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:11.000
I don't know, like I said, they're a booth, they can

02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:13.000
do whatever the hell they want

02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:15.000
Toagak in our chatroom at chat.orangelandre.com

02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:17.000
says, I like the whole, we don't care if you are

02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:19.000
media stuff, believe it or not, me too

02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:21.000
I, and I wish they did the same thing at E3

02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:23.000
I know that sounds weird, cause, like, you know

02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:25.000
I, I, you know, can get media

02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:27.000
credentials for E3, but I just, I kinda

02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:29.000
like it when everybody's in the same footy, but E3

02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:31.000
you can't see E3 anymore without

02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:33.000
Here's the thing with E3, planning it out six months

02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:35.000
in advance, even if you do get media credentials

02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:37.000
it still doesn't matter, because

02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:39.000
they basically look at you

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:41.000
they're like, oh, well you're not IGN

02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:43.000
or, you know, 1up

02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:45.000
or whatever, so, well we don't

02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:47.000
know who you are, so we don't care

02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:49.000
you know, so it doesn't matter, you can get

02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:51.000
it's because a lot of the marketing people

02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:53.000
behind video games, don't play

02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:55.000
video games, and know nothing about video games

02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:57.000
there's so many of them out there

02:24:57.000 --> 02:24:59.000
that just don't

02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:01.000
they don't even know the product that they're

02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:03.000
selling Oh yeah, I know that, I deal with a lot of

02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:05.000
corporate sales reps from these

02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:07.000
companies that are talking about the games coming on

02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:09.000
and I start asking a question about stuff and they're like

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:11.000
I don't know, I don't play games, it's like

02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:13.000
you know, you don't even know your own product?

02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:15.000
I mean, come on

02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:17.000
It's pretty astounding

02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:19.000
kind of sad though

02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:21.000
but

02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:23.000
we just have to support those companies that

02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:25.000
you know, know what they're doing

02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:27.000
just like Konami, they don't like to

02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:29.000
invite us anymore to things, but I understand

02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:31.000
they're not in San Francisco anymore, but

02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:33.000
so what, you know, you can at least send the damn

02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:35.000
invite, and if we can't make it, that's not a big deal

02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:37.000
well, the DDR thing was public, and I thought

02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:39.000
that was great

02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:41.000
yeah, that was a great way to do it

02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:43.000
exactly, let all the people who really want to see it, go see it

02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:45.000
alright, anyhow, let's

02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:47.000
open up the mailbag

02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:49.000
yay, every week you guys send us emails

02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:51.000
here at mailbag at orangelandrado.com

02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:53.000
we select a few of our favorites

02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:55.000
and read them here on air

02:25:55.000 --> 02:25:57.000
mailbag at orangelandrado.com

02:25:57.000 --> 02:25:59.000
looks like our mailbag is very full from that mail we got

02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:01.000
I'm not reading all of them

02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:03.000
so don't be

02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:05.000
butthurt if you don't get your email read

02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:07.000
basically if it was one asking us to advertise

02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:09.000
usernames, or asking us about

02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:11.000
advertising, or asking us

02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:13.000
about those types of things, we'll be replying

02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:15.000
to you offline

02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:17.000
um, first one up

02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:19.000
um, hello O.L.R.

02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:21.000
Haseo Sumi

02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:23.000
uh, I can't say anything

02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:25.000
Haseo Sumi Ragawa

02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:27.000
um, hey, or Pliskin, as it was

02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:29.000
in my last email, yes, it's a Metal Gear Solid reference

02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:31.000
um, if Rob still

02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:33.000
hates Justin Bieber, have him watch this, whatever

02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:35.000
um, sorry, it's a

02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:37.000
a video that I haven't pulled up

02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:39.000
oh, everybody saw, it's probably him

02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:41.000
getting hit with a water bottle

02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:43.000
I saw the Keyboard Cat

02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:45.000
version of that

02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:47.000
and Dark Sakura, if you still love Doctor Who

02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:49.000
I have a video for you, and I pulled it up and I'll watch it later

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:51.000
it's the Mighty Morphin' Dalek Rangers

02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:53.000
and on to non-Bieber

02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:55.000
stuff, um, okay, I tried to

02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:57.000
download a shady copy of Bleach Heat

02:26:57.000 --> 02:26:59.000
the Soul 6 for a Japanese game site

02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:01.000
but for some reason it keeps saying

02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:03.000
corrupted or unsupported data, any suggestions?

02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:05.000
punctuation?

02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:07.000
um, no, I'm kidding, um

02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:09.000
I would say, um

02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:11.000
check your region

02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:13.000
what?

02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:15.000
what was the question?

02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:17.000
it downloaded a copy of Bleach Heat

02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:19.000
the Soul 6 from a

02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:21.000
Japanese game site

02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:23.000
but it says corrupted or unsupported

02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:25.000
data is that through an emulator

02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:27.000
or through a console? it didn't say

02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:29.000
he downloaded it?

02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:31.000
give us more details, dude you get what you pay

02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:33.000
for, I mean

02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:35.000
re-download it

02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:37.000
I don't know, if it's a PC game

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:39.000
then it sounds like it's just a corrupted download

02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:41.000
and you have to re-download it

02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:43.000
if you're downloading a pirated version of a game

02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:45.000
of some sort, um

02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:47.000
perhaps you need to burn it at a lower

02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:49.000
lower speed

02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:51.000
if you're pirating a current game

02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:53.000
I don't think we can really help you

02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:55.000
I mean, you're not supposed to be doing that, naughty naughty

02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:57.000
if this is a game I don't recognize

02:27:57.000 --> 02:27:59.000
from like 10, 15 years ago

02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:01.000
they don't make anymore

02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:03.000
well then, we can't help you

02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:05.000
I think it's a PC game

02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:07.000
if you bought it legitimately

02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:09.000
then call the people who made the game

02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:11.000
they can answer

02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:13.000
he said shady

02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:15.000
and third I would like to thank Rob

02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:17.000
for his advice on an earlier episode

02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:19.000
what you said helped, I told my friend

02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:21.000
but not family for certain reasons

02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:23.000
and I'm currently dating someone, once again thanks

02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:25.000
oh, I'm glad to hear things worked out

02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:27.000
I remember that email

02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:29.000
so, um, good

02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:31.000
I'm really really glad to hear it

02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:33.000
and thank you Dark Soccer for reading my email

02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:35.000
if you didn't, what the hell?

02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:37.000
well, fine, thank you

02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:39.000
thanks as always, your loyal listener, Haseo Sumiragawa

02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:41.000
well, I'm

02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:43.000
very glad, I hope my

02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:45.000
headache hasn't made me too grumpy when reading it

02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:47.000
um, oh, good lord

02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:49.000
long

02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:51.000
email

02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:53.000
helping Akai Ripper

02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:55.000
might be the longest meal in

02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:57.000
OLR history, I don't know, it might be

02:28:57.000 --> 02:28:59.000
good morning

02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:01.000
everyone, this is the other Swede, Jiditz

02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:03.000
writing in, I usually

02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:05.000
rant about something, or comment

02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:07.000
on things that were brought up during the last live show

02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:09.000
but not this time

02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:11.000
during episode 376, which is the show

02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:13.000
before the previous one, Akai Ripper called in

02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:15.000
and told us of his angst and how Blizzard had wronged him

02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:17.000
seeing as that episode

02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:19.000
went up kind of late, I didn't have time

02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:21.000
to listen to the episode before the next

02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:23.000
one aired, and couldn't share my knowledge

02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:25.000
and experience when it comes to activating and playing

02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:27.000
Starcraft 2, all that is about to change

02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:29.000
so hold onto your socks and put your pants back

02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:31.000
on because it's, what?

02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:33.000
because it's time for a story of epic proportions

02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:35.000
filled to the brim with angst

02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:37.000
I have to put my pants back on

02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:39.000
yeah, cause Rob's been

02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:41.000
sitting here pantsless the whole time

02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:43.000
I'm comfortable

02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:45.000
twas the morning of the 27th

02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:47.000
of July and the first thing I heard

02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:49.000
was the blaring of my alarm clock

02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:51.000
proclaiming it was the time for me to get up

02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:53.000
had approached

02:29:53.000 --> 02:29:55.000
excuse me

02:29:55.000 --> 02:29:57.000
didn't mean to do

02:29:57.000 --> 02:29:59.000
with slow steps I went up to the kitchen

02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:01.000
to prepare my breakfast which on this

02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:03.000
specific day consisted of two slices of toast

02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:05.000
and a cup of coffee, the perfect combination

02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:07.000
of breakfast items if you ask me

02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:09.000
after gulping down my coffee

02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:11.000
I went to feed Gullen, my polar bear cub

02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:13.000
and then

02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:15.000
oh my god, get to the point, like

02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:17.000
I appreciated the storytelling, but

02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:19.000
hold on, and then proceeded to get ready

02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:21.000
to leave the house, now you may think

02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:23.000
I went up early to stand in line to get my copy of

02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:25.000
Starcraft 2, but you were sorely mistaken

02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:27.000
you see, during the summer break I managed to acquire

02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:29.000
an ingrown nail on my big toe on both my

02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:31.000
feet, ow, this made walking

02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:33.000
overall quite painful, so I promptly got in touch with my

02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:35.000
doctor who had a spot open during the

02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:37.000
27th of July, Starcraft 2 day

02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:39.000
after a swift drive to the doctor's office

02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:41.000
and later an extra 20 minutes of waiting

02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:43.000
I finally get placed atop one of those

02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:45.000
odd beds they have at the hospital and the

02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:47.000
doctor arrives, oh lord

02:30:47.000 --> 02:30:49.000
ok, ok, ok, ok, ok, look

02:30:49.000 --> 02:30:51.000
I realize we're all about where every gamer

02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:53.000
has a voice, and you know, I

02:30:53.000 --> 02:30:55.000
want everybody to have their say, but

02:30:55.000 --> 02:30:57.000
next time let's just try

02:30:57.000 --> 02:30:59.000
some shit went down, and

02:30:59.000 --> 02:31:01.000
no, I'm trying to see if there's a point

02:31:01.000 --> 02:31:03.000
Jamie Summers is not your LiveJournal client

02:31:03.000 --> 02:31:05.000
no I'm not, some

02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:07.000
and I feel really bad about your

02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:09.000
ingrown toenails, dude

02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:11.000
you know what, I

02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:13.000
I think, get a LiveJournal

02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:15.000
I think Alan's making

02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:17.000
a really good point there

02:31:17.000 --> 02:31:19.000
I feel like an ass now, I'm sorry

02:31:19.000 --> 02:31:21.000
that was really nice, but

02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:23.000
I'm not trying to be rude, but it's a

02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:25.000
3 hour show, not 10

02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:27.000
we can read this email during the

02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:29.000
Labor Day show, I'm gonna read

02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:31.000
I wanna read out of it, fine

02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:33.000
after all the crap with the doctor

02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:35.000
paraphrasing of course

02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:37.000
I wondered how

02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:39.000
I could get the damn game, I thought

02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:41.000
I could get it at home, so I went home

02:31:41.000 --> 02:31:43.000
I'm paraphrasing now, ok

02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:45.000
thank you

02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:47.000
you turn it on, start a firefox

02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:49.000
pull out the credit card

02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:51.000
and then

02:31:51.000 --> 02:31:53.000
Blizzard wanted to pay 60 euros

02:31:53.000 --> 02:31:55.000
which is about 589

02:31:55.000 --> 02:31:57.000
point 80 Swedish kronor

02:31:57.000 --> 02:31:59.000
which is 77 bucks

02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:01.000
for the digital purpose

02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:03.000
at the local store it's 399 kronor

02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:05.000
which is 52 dollars

02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:07.000
so to buy a physical copy

02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:09.000
it cost him 20 bucks cheaper

02:32:09.000 --> 02:32:11.000
to go get the physical copy

02:32:11.000 --> 02:32:13.000
so he did that

02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:15.000
blah blah blah blah blah

02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:17.000
gonna install it, gonna play

02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:19.000
no, ok

02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:21.000
now this is where I'm gonna read the email again

02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:23.000
cause I'm pretty down into it now

02:32:23.000 --> 02:32:25.000
the game said my Blizzard account did not have an

02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:27.000
activated copy of the game associated to it

02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:29.000
which I found to be strange since I had seen

02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:31.000
with my own eyes, a quick google search revealed

02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:33.000
I was not alone with this problem, but I was sad

02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:35.000
that no one had found a way to fix it

02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:37.000
so now we get to the point that might be able

02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:39.000
thank you, might be able to help everyone

02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:41.000
who has a similar problem, specifically

02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:43.000
OkRipper, and having problems

02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:45.000
getting through to the customer service support line

02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:47.000
just email customer support

02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:49.000
I emailed Blizzard support explaining my problem

02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:51.000
which I had, you know, what I had tried

02:32:51.000 --> 02:32:53.000
and that I would love some information on what I was doing wrong

02:32:53.000 --> 02:32:55.000
within 6 hours I had gotten a reply that said they had

02:32:55.000 --> 02:32:57.000
fixed the problem with the following

02:32:57.000 --> 02:32:59.000
and the following attempt to play Starcraft 2

02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:01.000
was successful, and it was beautiful

02:33:01.000 --> 02:33:03.000
alright, story time isn't

02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:05.000
is over, but this email isn't

02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:07.000
so straighten up your backs and get ready for

02:33:07.000 --> 02:33:09.000
Jiditz Indie Game of the Century

02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:11.000
uhhh

02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:13.000
there's codes

02:33:13.000 --> 02:33:15.000
oh, sweet, codes

02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:17.000
oh, are we supposed to read the entire email

02:33:17.000 --> 02:33:19.000
and then light the codes for the reward? oops

02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:21.000
I've been giving this guy a hard time

02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:23.000
toigak in chatroom says, control F

02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:25.000
point

02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:27.000
hahahahaha

02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:29.000
my point is

02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:31.000
so

02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:33.000
my friend who happens to be the developer finishes

02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:35.000
Xbox Indie game Seaside Racing

02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:37.000
a couple weeks ago and is now up for sale

02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:39.000
on Xbox Live Marketplace for only 80 Microsoft points

02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:41.000
Seaside Racing is a

02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:43.000
stylistic physics based kart racer

02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:45.000
made by a single person and is

02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:47.000
currently features 3 maps, Xbox

02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:49.000
Avatar implementation, and up to

02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:51.000
8 player multiplayer, there's trailers

02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:53.000
up here, I'll link it in the chatroom

02:33:53.000 --> 02:33:55.000
umm

02:33:55.000 --> 02:33:57.000
he has 4 codes to give away

02:33:57.000 --> 02:33:59.000
sweet

02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:01.000
we are going to be giving

02:34:01.000 --> 02:34:03.000
away codes later on

02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:05.000
maybe we'll post them on like Twitter and Facebook

02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:07.000
to some fans later in the week

02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:09.000
I will actually save this

02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:11.000
email then

02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:13.000
but I might keep a code for myself

02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:15.000
I want to play it

02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:17.000
PS, big thanks to Dark Saga for reading this long email

02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:19.000
umm kind of

02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:21.000
oops

02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:23.000
oops

02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:25.000
oops

02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:27.000
oops

02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:29.000
to tell you a story

02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:31.000
I would have believed the polar bear

02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:33.000
and I'll tell you why

02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:35.000
when Lord Byron

02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:37.000
you know the poet, went to college

02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:39.000
he was not allowed to have

02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:41.000
the rules were no dogs allowed on campus

02:34:41.000 --> 02:34:43.000
but it did not say anything about a bear

02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:45.000
so he had a pet bear

02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:47.000
I think when he went to Cambridge

02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:49.000
true story

02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:51.000
true facts

02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:53.000
so the polar bear could have been possible

02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:55.000
I wanted to know what kind of toothpaste

02:34:55.000 --> 02:34:57.000
he used, I could have

02:34:57.000 --> 02:34:59.000
used what type of magazines

02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:01.000
in the doctor's office

02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:03.000
so yeah

02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:05.000
I just don't think your email was detailed enough

02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:07.000
to get a sense of

02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:09.000
the situation

02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:11.000
and dire urgency

02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:13.000
I moved it

02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:15.000
to the inbox

02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:17.000
I'm glad to hear that emailing blizzard support

02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:19.000
was a great option

02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:21.000
I just want to say though like you could have condensed

02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:23.000
that down to twitter size

02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:25.000
tell akehripper to email them

02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:27.000
just

02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:29.000
move to inbox

02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:31.000
here's some codes

02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:33.000
no I'm giving this poor guy a hard time

02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:35.000
we do appreciate the email

02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:37.000
I'm sorry I paraphrased

02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:39.000
but I did read it

02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:41.000
and it was entertaining

02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:43.000
and I want a polar bear now

02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:45.000
I'm just going to replace the pony

02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:47.000
you know when I go to a restaurant

02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:49.000
and someone says is there anything else you'd like

02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:51.000
say a pony

02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:53.000
now I'm going to say a polar bear, thank you

02:35:53.000 --> 02:35:55.000
yeah because one time you ended up getting a coney

02:35:55.000 --> 02:35:57.000
when you asked for a pony the waitress brought you a

02:35:57.000 --> 02:35:59.000
coney dog and I laughed

02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:01.000
I took it home to Dan though and he ate it

02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:03.000
and you totally felt guilty like the waitress was

02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:05.000
going to take it back going oh

02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:07.000
you were trying to be funny

02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:09.000
oh I see

02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:11.000
people usually do laugh

02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:13.000
blame the sonic intercom

02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:15.000
speaker

02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:17.000
by the way one of the sonics in Roseville closed

02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:19.000
just so you know

02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:21.000
I know the one that was built into the

02:36:21.000 --> 02:36:23.000
what's up with that

02:36:23.000 --> 02:36:25.000
where was the other one

02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:27.000
there's one over on

02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:29.000
I'm sure our international listeners

02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:31.000
in Mexico really appreciate this talk

02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:33.000
but I think it's over on like Paradise

02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:35.000
Grove or whatever that street is called

02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:37.000
you know what I'm talking about Office 65

02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:39.000
go up 65

02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:41.000
and there's like a

02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:43.000
Pleasant Grove that's it

02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:45.000
Pleasant Grove

02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:47.000
that's where it is

02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:49.000
over by Walmart

02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:51.000
by Walmart

02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:53.000
I think it was the first day you ever met Alan

02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:55.000
yes it was

02:36:55.000 --> 02:36:57.000
and we had tater tots and it was magical

02:36:57.000 --> 02:36:59.000
next

02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:01.000
up

02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:03.000
hey guys this is

02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:05.000
I'm not going to read your name sorry dude I don't care if you put your name in there

02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:07.000
I'm not reading it kid whatever

02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:09.000
it's been a while since I've talked to you

02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:11.000
I'm not sure if you've kept up on the money

02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:13.000
related to music activities

02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:15.000
I've been doing but I have some new

02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:17.000
releases on disco warp music

02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:19.000
that I think you'll want to post about so please get back to me

02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:21.000

02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:23.000

02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:29.000
you have to email him to do that

02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:31.000
he's probably not actually

02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:33.000
listening to this show

02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:35.000
was he on it? didn't we have him on years and years ago?

02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:37.000
yeah but he's probably listening

02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:39.000
well hi

02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:41.000

02:37:55.000 --> 02:37:57.000
I'm trying to keep him

02:37:57.000 --> 02:37:59.000
in his place

02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:01.000
and you are inflating his ego

02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:03.000
we need some dan sucks emails

02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:05.000

rob

rob rob rob rob

02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:19.000

no it's mine I'm gonna put it on my head

02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:25.000
oh this

02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:27.000
is cool it's from robaba

02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:29.000
and it's actually someone I'm a fan of

02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:31.000
um writer Peter David posted

02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:33.000
on his blog that he is writing the Tron

02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:35.000
comic book I'm not sure if it will

02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:37.000
be released as a graphic novel

02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:39.000
it probably will as it catches up

02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:41.000
on the story behind Tron Legacy

02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:43.000
I'm not a fanboy much but I am a

02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:45.000
Tron fanboy I actually like Peter David

02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:47.000
and I've read um

02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:49.000
some of his Star Trek novels

02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:51.000
and I think he wrote

02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:53.000
the novelization for Iron Man

02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:55.000
so it was I like

02:38:55.000 --> 02:38:57.000
his writing a lot so

02:38:57.000 --> 02:38:59.000
all I know about Tron is that I heard a rumor

02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:01.000
this week that the Muppet

02:39:01.000 --> 02:39:03.000
3D theater at California Adventure

02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:05.000
is supposed to be being transformed into a Tron

02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:07.000
3D preview I know

02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:09.000
right? that's pretty much

02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:11.000
the same noise I made when I heard

02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:15.000
I didn't quite

02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:17.000
make that noise but close

02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:19.000
is that it for emails? no

02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:21.000
like I said we have a bunch and I'm only reading a few

02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:23.000
another one from robaba

02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:25.000
now that Microsoft announced Windows Phone 7

02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:27.000
a near random thought came to mind

02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:29.000
is Game Room meant for the mobile phone?

02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:31.000
it also has a heavy emphasis

02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:33.000
on games in your live account

02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:35.000
I think they are smart to do this

02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:37.000
since games would be one of the few things

02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:39.000
to rope people in you know they actually

02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:41.000
what was

02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:43.000
what was Microsoft's the Zune

02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:45.000
were they

02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:47.000
were they supposed to have had Zune integration

02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:49.000
for Xbox Live

02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:51.000
Indie Games I think was a rumor a while back

02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:53.000
that XNA would play on the Zune 2

02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:55.000
remember that thing at E3 where we sat on the big floor

02:39:55.000 --> 02:39:57.000
with the subwoofer built into it

02:39:57.000 --> 02:39:59.000
and it vibrated your butt every time the bass

02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:01.000
would go loud and they had the phone

02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:03.000
integration thing and people pulling

02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:05.000
them around for their big pitch

02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:07.000
yeah yeah

02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:09.000
I don't remember what it was called

02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:11.000
but I guess Microsoft

02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:13.000
released a smartphone that came

02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:15.000
and went in like three months

02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:17.000
I posted it out on my Facebook

02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:19.000
is that this Windows Phone?

02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:21.000
it had a very

02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:23.000
specific brand name

02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:25.000
like a Zune obviously

02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:27.000
but that's their music player

02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:29.000
but there was a Microsoft phone

02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:31.000
that was out for two months

02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:33.000
I had never even heard of it and they were like

02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:35.000
oh the kin

02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:37.000
I remember they had the girl on Facebook

02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:39.000
going around and meeting people

02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:41.000
and people were like who the fuck are you

02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:43.000
anyway

02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:45.000
ooh a hard

02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:47.000
question

02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:49.000
yay

02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:51.000
what I'm excited

02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:53.000
you're as exciting as being

02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:55.000
forced to eat Robin's minstrels

02:40:55.000 --> 02:40:57.000
greetings

02:40:57.000 --> 02:40:59.000
I come here today with a question about morality

02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:01.000
I've always been a PC gamer

02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:03.000
and usually pay between 20 to 50 bucks

02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:05.000
for games Wheel of morality

02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:07.000
turn turn turn tell us the lesson

02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:09.000
that we should learn

02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:11.000
and today's moral is

02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:13.000
early to rise

02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:15.000
and early to bed may make a man wise

02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:17.000
but socially dead

02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:19.000
read the damn email

02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:21.000
and as long as I've got some good time

02:41:21.000 --> 02:41:23.000
out of it I'm fine paying that

02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:25.000
now I won't lie and say I haven't gotten

02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:27.000
some games by other means either

02:41:27.000 --> 02:41:29.000
now to my problem I've recently bought a PS3

02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:31.000
and am appalled that there isn't

02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:33.000
fire and blood protesting

02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:35.000
at these $60

02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:37.000
price points for games

02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:39.000
as game companies whine when their games

02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:41.000
don't make tons of profit

02:41:41.000 --> 02:41:43.000
you know as well as I do

02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:45.000
that when Steam puts a game up for 50% off sale

02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:47.000
it sells like hotcakes and the developer makes

02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:49.000
money has there been any PS3

02:41:49.000 --> 02:41:51.000
game developers that put their game up for

02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:53.000
40 to 50 bucks I wonder if they

02:41:53.000 --> 02:41:55.000
would sell more

02:41:55.000 --> 02:41:57.000
and thus make more

02:41:57.000 --> 02:41:59.000
3D Dot Game Heroes was

02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:01.000
$39.99 maybe

02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:03.000
$49.99 but it was in that price range

02:42:03.000 --> 02:42:05.000
you talk about there I believe

02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:07.000
in America it sold

02:42:07.000 --> 02:42:09.000
$150K which isn't

02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:11.000
terrible but I

02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:13.000
don't know if it'll have a sequel

02:42:13.000 --> 02:42:15.000
actually for an atlas game that's really good

02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:17.000
but it also came out around the same time as Lost Planet 2

02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:19.000
Escape 3, Red Dead Redemption

02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:21.000
split second blur

02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:23.000
and that is also one game

02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:25.000
and I can't think of a whole lot

02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:27.000
that were cheaper I guess Super Street Fighter 2 was cheaper

02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:29.000
yes

02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:31.000
it was also you know an upgrade

02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:33.000
to a game that you'd already paid

02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:35.000
50 bucks for before

02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:37.000
well now he's saying I've included a link

02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:39.000
to the new PS3 USB hack that might be real

02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:41.000
of course we covered it earlier

02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:43.000
and to be truthful at $60 a game is it a little

02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:45.000
it is a little tempting what do you guys think about it

02:42:45.000 --> 02:42:47.000
your loyal turtle in Philly

02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:49.000
is serious turtle

02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:51.000
um

02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:53.000
games are expensive but they've always been

02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:55.000
expensive Street Fighter 2

02:42:55.000 --> 02:42:57.000
speaking of which since we're talking about all these Street Fighter games

02:42:57.000 --> 02:42:59.000
the original cartridge was what 70 bucks

02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:01.000
Mortal Kombat was that bad

02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:03.000
Chrono Trigger was pushin' 80 at one point

02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:05.000
killer instinct I paid 60 bucks for

02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:07.000
at Montgomery Wards

02:43:07.000 --> 02:43:09.000
and keep in mind this is

02:43:09.000 --> 02:43:11.000
10-15 years ago without inflation

02:43:11.000 --> 02:43:13.000
oh no no no I was still in high school

02:43:13.000 --> 02:43:15.000
no I wasn't I was in college

02:43:15.000 --> 02:43:17.000
this was about 15 years ago

02:43:17.000 --> 02:43:19.000
it was before I moved out here so yeah about 15 years ago

02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:21.000
so you know video games have actually always

02:43:21.000 --> 02:43:23.000
kind of been a little bit expensive

02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:25.000
they dropped a lot when they went to CD

02:43:25.000 --> 02:43:27.000
and that was part of the charm about

02:43:27.000 --> 02:43:29.000
why CD gaming was really good

02:43:29.000 --> 02:43:31.000
because they weren't putting all that extra chips

02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:33.000
in cartridge so by the time the PlayStation 1

02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:35.000
PlayStation 2 era came around they actually

02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:37.000
dropped in price quite a bit

02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:39.000
but now they're slowly climbing back up to where they used to be

02:43:39.000 --> 02:43:41.000
not that I'm necessarily saying it's

02:43:41.000 --> 02:43:43.000
justified because you're right there's a lot of

02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:45.000
crap out there for 60 bucks

02:43:45.000 --> 02:43:47.000
that really shouldn't be

02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:49.000
but again what was I saying about

02:43:49.000 --> 02:43:51.000
the marketing people behind video games earlier

02:43:51.000 --> 02:43:53.000
that many of them

02:43:53.000 --> 02:43:55.000
they don't play games oh yeah they don't play the games

02:43:55.000 --> 02:43:57.000
so everything to them

02:43:57.000 --> 02:43:59.000
is gold

02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:01.000
I think that gaming fandom at large

02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:03.000
or at least this is how the corporations

02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:05.000
have kind of treated gaming fandom is that

02:44:05.000 --> 02:44:07.000
they're very fickle

02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:09.000
and they have a very short attention span

02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:11.000
once a game is older than three months

02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:13.000
no one cares

02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:15.000
like remember when I said buy Starcraft 2

02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:17.000
six months after it comes out

02:44:17.000 --> 02:44:19.000
and it's like well no one's

02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:21.000
everyone's going to have moved on by then

02:44:21.000 --> 02:44:23.000
you have to charge your 60 bucks

02:44:23.000 --> 02:44:25.000
because once the game is three months old

02:44:25.000 --> 02:44:27.000
and you've made your money back by then

02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:29.000
no one's going to care

02:44:29.000 --> 02:44:31.000
movies are very similar

02:44:31.000 --> 02:44:33.000
if you don't make your box office back in several weeks

02:44:33.000 --> 02:44:35.000
then

02:44:35.000 --> 02:44:37.000
direct to DVD when everyone else buys it and it becomes a cool hit

02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:39.000
yeah

02:44:39.000 --> 02:44:41.000
so I think it has a lot to do with

02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:43.000
the analysts and their margins

02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:45.000
of if this game doesn't

02:44:45.000 --> 02:44:47.000
sell this much past

02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:49.000
six weeks or whatever

02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:51.000
their benchmark is then

02:44:51.000 --> 02:44:53.000
yeah so they charge you 60 bucks for it

02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:55.000
people who don't play video games are ruining the gaming industry

02:44:55.000 --> 02:44:57.000
alright

02:44:57.000 --> 02:44:59.000
I have one last email

02:44:59.000 --> 02:45:01.000
are you ready?

02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:03.000
yes

02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:05.000
um

02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:07.000
yo guys I just recently got hooked on your show

02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:09.000
and I was very sad to not hear your

02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:11.000
angelic lol voices last week

02:45:11.000 --> 02:45:13.000
anyway I'm emailing you

02:45:13.000 --> 02:45:15.000
wondering if you have any good PSP

02:45:15.000 --> 02:45:17.000
titles that you could suggest to me and other

02:45:17.000 --> 02:45:19.000
listeners as I am slowly getting tired

02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:21.000
of Monster Hunter 2, Dissidia

02:45:21.000 --> 02:45:23.000
and Fireteam Bravo

02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:25.000
two thirds I guess

02:45:25.000 --> 02:45:27.000
I'll honestly go for

02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:29.000
almost anything aside from sports games

02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:31.000
ew thanks and may the Flying Spaghetti

02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:33.000
Monster bless you pro butcher

02:45:33.000 --> 02:45:35.000
aka somebody

02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:37.000
um

02:45:37.000 --> 02:45:39.000
all hail his noodly

02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:41.000
goodness uh what was I going to say

02:45:41.000 --> 02:45:43.000
da da da da

02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:45.000
if you like Dissidia

02:45:45.000 --> 02:45:47.000
Final Fantasy 1 and 2 remakes are excellent

02:45:47.000 --> 02:45:49.000
on the PSP

02:45:49.000 --> 02:45:51.000
I think Luminous

02:45:51.000 --> 02:45:53.000
the old puzzler and it's sequel

02:45:53.000 --> 02:45:55.000
I think the sequel is good

02:45:55.000 --> 02:45:57.000
some of the best puzzle games they ever put out on the PSP

02:45:57.000 --> 02:45:59.000
almost was like a reason to own the system

02:45:59.000 --> 02:46:01.000
I liked Every Extend Extra

02:46:01.000 --> 02:46:03.000
which was another Mississippi game

02:46:03.000 --> 02:46:05.000
I liked Papa Locross for a good RPG

02:46:05.000 --> 02:46:07.000
Loco Roco is a cutesy game

02:46:07.000 --> 02:46:09.000
if you like cutesy games

02:46:09.000 --> 02:46:11.000
there's you know

02:46:11.000 --> 02:46:13.000
PSP has quite a few little highlights in there

02:46:13.000 --> 02:46:15.000
and a lot of the ports are surprisingly not bad

02:46:15.000 --> 02:46:17.000
like Little Big Planet on PSP

02:46:17.000 --> 02:46:19.000
32nd Game Heroes

02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:21.000
since I was talking about the 3D Dot Game Heroes

02:46:21.000 --> 02:46:23.000
the 32nd or Half Minute Hero

02:46:23.000 --> 02:46:25.000
whatever it's called is pretty good too

02:46:25.000 --> 02:46:27.000
and there's also going to be the new Kingdom Hearts game

02:46:27.000 --> 02:46:29.000
coming out in September

02:46:29.000 --> 02:46:31.000
and the Valkyria Chronicles

02:46:31.000 --> 02:46:33.000
if you like that kind of thing

02:46:33.000 --> 02:46:35.000
also of course

02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:37.000
there was I believe a Persona

02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:39.000
game that just came out

02:46:39.000 --> 02:46:41.000
on PSP

02:46:41.000 --> 02:46:43.000
um

02:46:43.000 --> 02:46:45.000
and there should be more stuff coming out

02:46:45.000 --> 02:46:47.000
in the 4th quarter of course

02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:49.000
if you like music games

02:46:49.000 --> 02:46:51.000
DJ Max is out there

02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:53.000
and I like Rock Band Unplugged

02:46:53.000 --> 02:46:55.000
but not everybody liked that

02:46:55.000 --> 02:46:57.000
but if you like your 2DX type games

02:46:57.000 --> 02:46:59.000
DJ Max is a good alternative

02:46:59.000 --> 02:47:01.000
I think that's it for music games

02:47:01.000 --> 02:47:03.000
Alf in our chat room

02:47:03.000 --> 02:47:05.000
is suggesting

02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:07.000
Hatsune Miku Project Diva

02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:09.000
I forgot about that one

02:47:09.000 --> 02:47:11.000
good call

02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:13.000
some of the PSP collections are really good too

02:47:13.000 --> 02:47:15.000
like the Gradius collection was pretty awesome

02:47:15.000 --> 02:47:17.000
there's some pretty good collections of games

02:47:17.000 --> 02:47:19.000
isn't there like a Mega Man collection on PSP as well?

02:47:19.000 --> 02:47:21.000
it's pretty cool

02:47:21.000 --> 02:47:23.000
but there's Mega Man

02:47:23.000 --> 02:47:25.000
Mega Man X remade

02:47:25.000 --> 02:47:27.000
the 3D

02:47:27.000 --> 02:47:29.000
they also have the powered up Mega Man

02:47:29.000 --> 02:47:31.000
the super deformed Mega Man 1

02:47:31.000 --> 02:47:33.000
alright

02:47:33.000 --> 02:47:35.000
well there you go, is that it for emails?

02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:37.000
I thought there was a last minute

02:47:37.000 --> 02:47:39.000
do you mind if I refresh the inbox?

02:47:39.000 --> 02:47:41.000
it was from you

02:47:41.000 --> 02:47:43.000
you were sending it wrong

02:47:43.000 --> 02:47:45.000
so I'm not checking it

02:47:45.000 --> 02:47:47.000
are you going to read it?

02:47:47.000 --> 02:47:49.000
I think you should read it

02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:51.000
I'm just so upset

02:47:51.000 --> 02:47:53.000
she's taking away my voice everybody

02:47:53.000 --> 02:47:55.000
that does not fit with the show

02:47:55.000 --> 02:47:57.000
I know

02:47:57.000 --> 02:47:59.000
it's a show where every gamer has a voice

02:47:59.000 --> 02:48:01.000
and I am not being heard

02:48:01.000 --> 02:48:03.000
especially since you are a super game analyst

02:48:03.000 --> 02:48:05.000
I know

02:48:05.000 --> 02:48:07.000
I am a video game analyst

02:48:07.000 --> 02:48:11.000
dark sakura just read it and she wants to die

02:48:11.000 --> 02:48:13.000
what's it say dark sakura?

02:48:13.000 --> 02:48:15.000
I hate you all so much

02:48:15.000 --> 02:48:19.000
I want you all to get the hot shotgun bullets to die

02:48:19.000 --> 02:48:21.000
I wrote dan sucks lol

02:48:21.000 --> 02:48:23.000
but I spelled sucks s-u-x

02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:25.000
because I know she loves that

02:48:25.000 --> 02:48:27.000
that sounds like proper English to me

02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:29.000
I mean, sucks

02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:31.000
that's how it turns out on my phone when I text people

02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:33.000
I don't know what to say

02:48:33.000 --> 02:48:35.000
I don't know what to say

02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:37.000
I'm on my own when I text people

02:48:37.000 --> 02:48:39.000
alright, ow

02:48:39.000 --> 02:48:41.000
you see this?

02:48:41.000 --> 02:48:43.000
it's mine now

02:48:43.000 --> 02:48:45.000
it's landed in my yard

02:48:45.000 --> 02:48:47.000
what the hell is it, Alan?

02:48:47.000 --> 02:48:49.000
you're sleeping on the couch

02:48:49.000 --> 02:48:51.000
alright

02:48:51.000 --> 02:48:53.000
this is definitely the time of the show

02:48:53.000 --> 02:48:55.000
I approve of Alan, thank you so much

02:48:55.000 --> 02:48:57.000
this is definitely the part of the show where we're going to get angsty

02:48:57.000 --> 02:49:15.000
with a segment we call the FUs of the Week

02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:17.000
FU to my head hurting

02:49:17.000 --> 02:49:21.000
and Rob

02:49:21.000 --> 02:49:23.000
you stink

02:49:23.000 --> 02:49:25.000
you sucks

02:49:25.000 --> 02:49:27.000
um

02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:29.000
I guess FU to lack of sleep

02:49:29.000 --> 02:49:31.000
but you know

02:49:31.000 --> 02:49:33.000
the baby doesn't know better

02:49:33.000 --> 02:49:35.000
he just doesn't know what night and day is yet

02:49:35.000 --> 02:49:37.000
and he also

02:49:37.000 --> 02:49:39.000
had trouble pooping

02:49:39.000 --> 02:49:41.000
hopefully he is past that now

02:49:41.000 --> 02:49:43.000
because I hate trying to make him poop

02:49:43.000 --> 02:49:45.000
it's difficult

02:49:45.000 --> 02:49:47.000
well, it's not difficult

02:49:47.000 --> 02:49:49.000
but it's gotta be embarrassing for him

02:49:49.000 --> 02:49:51.000
but he doesn't know anything yet

02:49:51.000 --> 02:49:53.000
tell Nellie to stop eating onions

02:49:53.000 --> 02:49:55.000
that has nothing to do with him not pooping

02:49:55.000 --> 02:49:57.000
you know, I'm really curious

02:49:57.000 --> 02:49:59.000
if we're going to have a

02:49:59.000 --> 02:50:01.000
are we going to get

02:50:01.000 --> 02:50:03.000
are we going to get poop stories every week on OLR now?

02:50:03.000 --> 02:50:05.000
that would be great

02:50:05.000 --> 02:50:07.000
sure, I can tell you poop stories

02:50:07.000 --> 02:50:09.000
see, because he is constipated

02:50:09.000 --> 02:50:11.000
so he can't go

02:50:11.000 --> 02:50:13.000
you have to take

02:50:13.000 --> 02:50:15.000
so he has to have little

02:50:15.000 --> 02:50:17.000
suppositories

02:50:17.000 --> 02:50:19.000
put up there

02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:21.000
poor guy

02:50:21.000 --> 02:50:23.000
but it triggers him to poop

02:50:23.000 --> 02:50:25.000
and he this morning

02:50:25.000 --> 02:50:27.000
he pooped like 3 times

02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:29.000
congratulations

02:50:29.000 --> 02:50:31.000
it's good for him

02:50:31.000 --> 02:50:33.000
but he still grunts all night long

02:50:33.000 --> 02:50:35.000
and does his kung fu

02:50:35.000 --> 02:50:37.000
that's quite good for having him watch Ninja Warrior

02:50:37.000 --> 02:50:39.000
Alan Jeff and the FUs

02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:41.000
hopefully the don't involve poop

02:50:41.000 --> 02:50:43.000
his first word should be hadalken

02:50:45.000 --> 02:50:47.000
FU to salmonella

02:50:47.000 --> 02:50:49.000
E. coli and other invisible poop

02:50:49.000 --> 02:50:51.000
that hides in your food and makes you sick

02:50:51.000 --> 02:50:53.000
when you go on vacation

02:50:53.000 --> 02:50:55.000
bad eggs?

02:50:55.000 --> 02:50:57.000
bad chicken I think

02:50:57.000 --> 02:50:59.000
maybe it was a bad egg

02:50:59.000 --> 02:51:01.000
alright, my FU of the week goes to the

02:51:01.000 --> 02:51:03.000
casinos in Reno, Nevada

02:51:03.000 --> 02:51:05.000
what came first, the bad chicken or the bad egg?

02:51:05.000 --> 02:51:07.000
my FU goes to the casinos in Reno, Nevada

02:51:07.000 --> 02:51:09.000
for taking a large, undisclosed

02:51:09.000 --> 02:51:11.000
sum of my money away from me this weekend

02:51:11.000 --> 02:51:13.000
it's not supposed to happen

02:51:13.000 --> 02:51:15.000
meanwhile, all my friends are going

02:51:15.000 --> 02:51:17.000
I won $400 playing craps

02:51:17.000 --> 02:51:19.000
how did you do?

02:51:19.000 --> 02:51:21.000
Dynafire

02:51:21.000 --> 02:51:23.000
no, I'm happy for my friends

02:51:23.000 --> 02:51:25.000
but I'm sad for me

02:51:25.000 --> 02:51:27.000
that's what's really important, right?

02:51:27.000 --> 02:51:29.000
just a couple more stories

02:51:29.000 --> 02:51:31.000
for you guys, and then the Skype line

02:51:31.000 --> 02:51:33.000
we're gonna take your phone calls, oh god

02:51:33.000 --> 02:51:35.000
Loki, what do you got for us?

02:51:35.000 --> 02:51:37.000
don't sound too excited there

02:51:37.000 --> 02:51:39.000
so I have some news

02:51:39.000 --> 02:51:41.000
about Super Street Fighter 4

02:51:41.000 --> 02:51:43.000
of course, the arcade version

02:51:43.000 --> 02:51:45.000
has a few empty slots

02:51:45.000 --> 02:51:47.000
available for some new characters

02:51:47.000 --> 02:51:49.000
and that's what they're gonna get

02:51:49.000 --> 02:51:51.000
they're gonna get some new characters

02:51:51.000 --> 02:51:53.000
that are gonna be, I guess, exclusive to the arcade

02:51:53.000 --> 02:51:55.000
at least for right now

02:51:55.000 --> 02:51:57.000
of course

02:51:57.000 --> 02:51:59.000
it doesn't say exactly what characters those

02:51:59.000 --> 02:52:01.000
are gonna be, I guess that is yet to be determined

02:52:01.000 --> 02:52:03.000
but there will be some new characters

02:52:03.000 --> 02:52:05.000
coming

02:52:05.000 --> 02:52:07.000
any characters you'd like to see

02:52:07.000 --> 02:52:09.000
in Super Street Fighter 4 that haven't

02:52:09.000 --> 02:52:11.000
come in yet?

02:52:11.000 --> 02:52:13.000
Alan, I know you're a big fighting game fan

02:52:13.000 --> 02:52:15.000
or any character that didn't make it from its

02:52:15.000 --> 02:52:17.000
I'm assuming they're gonna take more characters from Alpha

02:52:17.000 --> 02:52:19.000
and put them in

02:52:19.000 --> 02:52:21.000
I wouldn't mind

02:52:21.000 --> 02:52:23.000
Rolento

02:52:23.000 --> 02:52:25.000
also, what's her name?

02:52:25.000 --> 02:52:27.000
Alema?

02:52:27.000 --> 02:52:29.000
Elena?

02:52:29.000 --> 02:52:31.000
yeah, Alema's your Warcraft character

02:52:31.000 --> 02:52:33.000
yeah, from the

02:52:33.000 --> 02:52:35.000
kick character from Street Fighter 3

02:52:35.000 --> 02:52:37.000
was awesome, her

02:52:37.000 --> 02:52:39.000
might get to see it, who knows

02:52:39.000 --> 02:52:41.000
Darsakra, I know you're a Capcom

02:52:41.000 --> 02:52:43.000
fan girl too, any

02:52:43.000 --> 02:52:45.000
extra characters for Street Fighter 4?

02:52:45.000 --> 02:52:47.000
that I wanna see?

02:52:47.000 --> 02:52:49.000
well, in that arcade

02:52:49.000 --> 02:52:51.000
version, I would love to have Sakura

02:52:51.000 --> 02:52:53.000
if there was another arcade version

02:52:53.000 --> 02:52:55.000
well, she'd be in there because it's all the regular

02:52:55.000 --> 02:52:57.000
characters I'm saying for an arcade version

02:52:57.000 --> 02:52:59.000
I would want Sakura, and

02:52:59.000 --> 02:53:01.000
other than that, I'd say

02:53:01.000 --> 02:53:03.000
Ibuki

02:53:03.000 --> 02:53:05.000
because I was a big Ibuki player

02:53:05.000 --> 02:53:07.000
or maybe Karin

02:53:07.000 --> 02:53:09.000
alright

02:53:09.000 --> 02:53:11.000
I got one more story for you guys

02:53:11.000 --> 02:53:13.000
I know who would be great

02:53:13.000 --> 02:53:15.000
you know who would be great?

02:53:15.000 --> 02:53:17.000
Rainbow Mika

02:53:17.000 --> 02:53:19.000
she was the funny chick wrestler

02:53:19.000 --> 02:53:21.000
with the heart pasties

02:53:21.000 --> 02:53:23.000
alright

02:53:23.000 --> 02:53:25.000
moving on to another

02:53:25.000 --> 02:53:27.000
talking about a movie

02:53:27.000 --> 02:53:29.000
we probably would have talked more about this last week

02:53:29.000 --> 02:53:31.000
if we actually had a show, but we didn't

02:53:31.000 --> 02:53:33.000
so this is Scott Pilgrim vs. The World

02:53:33.000 --> 02:53:35.000
is making a lot of news, but

02:53:35.000 --> 02:53:37.000
sadly for the gamers, not the kind of news you like to hear

02:53:37.000 --> 02:53:39.000
it is not doing well at the box office

02:53:39.000 --> 02:53:41.000
BOMB

02:53:41.000 --> 02:53:43.000
in its first weekend at the box office

02:53:43.000 --> 02:53:45.000
it made 10.6 million dollars

02:53:45.000 --> 02:53:47.000
and while that still is a lot of money

02:53:47.000 --> 02:53:49.000
when you really put it into context

02:53:49.000 --> 02:53:51.000
it kinda sucks, because if you look at

02:53:51.000 --> 02:53:53.000
some of the recent releases that have come out

02:53:53.000 --> 02:53:55.000
and again

02:53:55.000 --> 02:53:57.000
what did it cost to make?

02:53:57.000 --> 02:53:59.000
Scott Pilgrim is, I wanna say 15

02:53:59.000 --> 02:54:01.000
but I don't know for sure

02:54:01.000 --> 02:54:03.000
is that profits?

02:54:03.000 --> 02:54:05.000
no, this is just straight box office tally

02:54:05.000 --> 02:54:07.000
so then it made less than it cost

02:54:07.000 --> 02:54:09.000
I believe

02:54:09.000 --> 02:54:11.000
they're saying that, yes

02:54:11.000 --> 02:54:13.000
but here's the thing too, I should say this

02:54:13.000 --> 02:54:15.000
technically it's not a video game movie

02:54:15.000 --> 02:54:17.000
it's a comic book movie

02:54:17.000 --> 02:54:19.000
but it's still got the whole

02:54:19.000 --> 02:54:21.000
video game tie in

02:54:21.000 --> 02:54:23.000
but this is the really sad part

02:54:23.000 --> 02:54:25.000
is that the movie

02:54:25.000 --> 02:54:27.000
Gamer with Gerard Butler

02:54:27.000 --> 02:54:29.000
made 11.8 million

02:54:29.000 --> 02:54:31.000
it made more money than Scott Pilgrim's first movie

02:54:31.000 --> 02:54:33.000
but that's a generic action movie with Gerard Butler

02:54:33.000 --> 02:54:35.000
I mean this movie didn't

02:54:35.000 --> 02:54:37.000
have a lot of big

02:54:37.000 --> 02:54:39.000
names in it, I mean Michael Cera

02:54:39.000 --> 02:54:41.000
yay, I don't know

02:54:41.000 --> 02:54:43.000
that and people have really

02:54:43.000 --> 02:54:45.000
terrible tastes

02:54:45.000 --> 02:54:47.000
Vampire Sucks

02:54:47.000 --> 02:54:49.000
being number two

02:54:49.000 --> 02:54:51.000
not to say that Expendables

02:54:51.000 --> 02:54:53.000
is a bad movie, but see that's once again a generic

02:54:53.000 --> 02:54:55.000
action movie, I mean if you like action movies

02:54:55.000 --> 02:54:57.000
you go see that, it's gonna be awesome

02:54:57.000 --> 02:54:59.000
whereas this is basically

02:54:59.000 --> 02:55:01.000
some guy that's

02:55:01.000 --> 02:55:03.000
falling in love with a woman and he has to fight

02:55:03.000 --> 02:55:05.000
her exes, I mean that's

02:55:05.000 --> 02:55:07.000
that's like

02:55:07.000 --> 02:55:09.000
that's almost like my super ex-girlfriend

02:55:09.000 --> 02:55:11.000
or something like that

02:55:11.000 --> 02:55:13.000
which is also lousy, but yeah

02:55:13.000 --> 02:55:15.000
I mean that's the kind of vibe

02:55:15.000 --> 02:55:17.000
that sends off, I mean granted it was an awesome

02:55:17.000 --> 02:55:19.000
movie, but not a lot of people

02:55:19.000 --> 02:55:21.000
really get that kind of stuff

02:55:21.000 --> 02:55:23.000
I mean they're not us

02:55:23.000 --> 02:55:25.000
Well for what it's worth, it made more money than The Wizard

02:55:25.000 --> 02:55:27.000
which made 4.2 million this opening weekend back in

02:55:27.000 --> 02:55:29.000
1989, and Alone

02:55:29.000 --> 02:55:31.000
in the Dark, it did better than a new evil movie

02:55:31.000 --> 02:55:33.000
Oh well I hope so

02:55:33.000 --> 02:55:35.000
And Double Dragon with Scott Wolf only made 2.6 million

02:55:35.000 --> 02:55:37.000
dollars this opening weekend, so at least

02:55:37.000 --> 02:55:39.000
it did better than that

02:55:39.000 --> 02:55:41.000
And Scott Wolf does not like people reminding him about

02:55:41.000 --> 02:55:43.000
that movie

02:55:43.000 --> 02:55:45.000
So you really liked Scott Pilgrim right?

02:55:45.000 --> 02:55:47.000
Loki?

02:55:47.000 --> 02:55:49.000
I loved it, I'd go see it again

02:55:49.000 --> 02:55:51.000
I just like the whole vibe of it, there's a lot of

02:55:51.000 --> 02:55:53.000
in-jokes I guess if you're a gamer

02:55:53.000 --> 02:55:55.000
a lot of things and references that you catch

02:55:55.000 --> 02:55:57.000
I like the characters in it, like I said

02:55:57.000 --> 02:55:59.000
one of my favorite characters was Wallace in there

02:55:59.000 --> 02:56:01.000
because he was just cracking all sorts of

02:56:01.000 --> 02:56:03.000
comments and stuff throughout the movie

02:56:03.000 --> 02:56:05.000
But see one of the things that

02:56:05.000 --> 02:56:07.000
bugged me about the movie is that characters

02:56:07.000 --> 02:56:09.000
like him, they just kind of disappear

02:56:09.000 --> 02:56:11.000
there's a lot not resolved

02:56:11.000 --> 02:56:13.000
I feel like they tried to cram too much

02:56:13.000 --> 02:56:15.000
with six comic books into one movie

02:56:15.000 --> 02:56:17.000
but I mean, how else are you going to do it?

02:56:17.000 --> 02:56:19.000
I don't really know how

02:56:19.000 --> 02:56:21.000
They did it with Watchmen and Watchmen worked

02:56:21.000 --> 02:56:23.000
True

02:56:23.000 --> 02:56:25.000
What did you think of the movie, Alan?

02:56:25.000 --> 02:56:27.000
I liked how the

02:56:27.000 --> 02:56:29.000
video game fandom meta stuff

02:56:29.000 --> 02:56:31.000
was put in

02:56:31.000 --> 02:56:33.000
As far as the actual story, I didn't

02:56:33.000 --> 02:56:35.000
care for it, I thought it was kind of creepy

02:56:35.000 --> 02:56:37.000
and sexist

02:56:37.000 --> 02:56:39.000
Because I'm all, I don't know

02:56:39.000 --> 02:56:41.000
I'm too serious about that kind of stuff

02:56:41.000 --> 02:56:43.000
Because you're a lesbian

02:56:43.000 --> 02:56:45.000
They glossed over some of the characters, like the twins for example

02:56:45.000 --> 02:56:47.000
They kind of glossed over who they even were

02:56:47.000 --> 02:56:49.000
We just knew they were twins, she dated them at some point

02:56:49.000 --> 02:56:51.000
and they had a battle

02:56:51.000 --> 02:56:53.000
and that was it

02:56:53.000 --> 02:56:55.000
I don't even know why they were terrible

02:56:55.000 --> 02:56:57.000
Well, I kind of think they should have just cut that scene

02:56:57.000 --> 02:56:59.000
out of the movie and just had her have five exes

02:56:59.000 --> 02:57:01.000
You know what I mean?

02:57:01.000 --> 02:57:03.000
And so they could develop something else

02:57:03.000 --> 02:57:05.000
It just seemed a little strange

02:57:05.000 --> 02:57:07.000
Part of what I really liked about it

02:57:07.000 --> 02:57:09.000
I think I liked it more than Alan did

02:57:09.000 --> 02:57:11.000
Although I did have some problems with it

02:57:11.000 --> 02:57:13.000
including an unlikeable main character

02:57:13.000 --> 02:57:15.000
I thought that

02:57:15.000 --> 02:57:17.000
it was so random in some parts

02:57:17.000 --> 02:57:19.000
that I couldn't help but laugh my ass off

02:57:19.000 --> 02:57:21.000
Vegan police?

02:57:21.000 --> 02:57:23.000
Yes, you're a vegan

02:57:23.000 --> 02:57:25.000
Telekinesis

02:57:25.000 --> 02:57:27.000
I just liked all the

02:57:27.000 --> 02:57:29.000
different random things

02:57:29.000 --> 02:57:31.000
in there, like for example

02:57:31.000 --> 02:57:33.000
At the end where he's complaining

02:57:33.000 --> 02:57:35.000
He's like

02:57:35.000 --> 02:57:37.000
I can't believe he did that

02:57:37.000 --> 02:57:39.000
It took me two hours!

02:57:39.000 --> 02:57:41.000
Two hours to look up all their information

02:57:41.000 --> 02:57:43.000
and contact numbers

02:57:43.000 --> 02:57:45.000
It was funny

02:57:45.000 --> 02:57:47.000
The League of Evil Exes

02:57:47.000 --> 02:57:49.000
See, I thought for sure that he'd become

02:57:49.000 --> 02:57:51.000
part of the League of Evil Exes

02:57:51.000 --> 02:57:53.000
at the end of the movie

02:57:53.000 --> 02:57:55.000
Oh my god, spoiler!

02:57:55.000 --> 02:57:57.000
I said I thought that he would

02:57:57.000 --> 02:57:59.000
Didn't say he actually did

02:57:59.000 --> 02:58:01.000
Alright, anyhow

02:58:01.000 --> 02:58:03.000
It was, um

02:58:03.000 --> 02:58:05.000
It was, it was okay

02:58:05.000 --> 02:58:07.000
No, I'd say I liked it

02:58:07.000 --> 02:58:09.000
I think I liked the direction

02:58:09.000 --> 02:58:11.000
and the ambiance of the movie

02:58:11.000 --> 02:58:13.000
and just the whole, like, you know

02:58:13.000 --> 02:58:15.000
just turning my brain off and enjoying it

02:58:15.000 --> 02:58:17.000
as like a video game, you know

02:58:17.000 --> 02:58:19.000
and I'd see it again, especially because

02:58:19.000 --> 02:58:21.000
Dark Soccer still hasn't seen it

02:58:21.000 --> 02:58:23.000
And seriously, you need to check out the PlayStation Network game

02:58:23.000 --> 02:58:25.000
It is awesome

02:58:25.000 --> 02:58:27.000
I bet it makes a really good

02:58:27.000 --> 02:58:29.000
video game, ironically

02:58:29.000 --> 02:58:31.000
It's an awesome game, and it's by that guy

02:58:31.000 --> 02:58:33.000
who, remember when we were doing

02:58:33.000 --> 02:58:35.000
Marvel vs. games

02:58:35.000 --> 02:58:37.000
or whatever, that you guys voted off

02:58:37.000 --> 02:58:39.000
Oh, how funny

02:58:39.000 --> 02:58:41.000
Because he does really awesome pixel art

02:58:41.000 --> 02:58:43.000
I don't remember his name now

02:58:43.000 --> 02:58:45.000
But yeah, he did the whole game

02:58:45.000 --> 02:58:47.000
River City Ransom-ish

02:58:47.000 --> 02:58:49.000
Well, I love River City Ransom

02:58:49.000 --> 02:58:51.000
I've been playing with the avatar creator

02:58:51.000 --> 02:58:53.000
on the website, though, that's pretty fun

02:58:53.000 --> 02:58:55.000
Yeah, I made a little avatar on there, too

02:58:55.000 --> 02:58:57.000
Ooh, what website?

02:58:57.000 --> 02:58:59.000
It's on the Scott Pilgrim vs. the World website

02:58:59.000 --> 02:59:01.000
Look at her Facebook or my Facebook, it's there

02:59:01.000 --> 02:59:03.000
Alright, let's open up the Skype line

02:59:03.000 --> 02:59:05.000
Take some calls

02:59:05.000 --> 02:59:07.000
1-877-GAME-OLR is our phone number

02:59:07.000 --> 02:59:09.000
or you can give us a call on the Skype line

02:59:09.000 --> 02:59:11.000
Our username on Skype is

02:59:11.000 --> 02:59:13.000
OrangeLoungeRadio, that's all one word

02:59:13.000 --> 02:59:15.000
But as a reminder, if you are gonna call us

02:59:15.000 --> 02:59:17.000
with your computer, please

02:59:17.000 --> 02:59:19.000
call Echo123

02:59:19.000 --> 02:59:21.000
first, and I think in the newer versions of Skype

02:59:21.000 --> 02:59:23.000
they actually say, make a test call

02:59:23.000 --> 02:59:25.000
Do not skip that step, it's very important

02:59:25.000 --> 02:59:27.000
because a lot of our crap calls

02:59:27.000 --> 02:59:29.000
come in because you didn't test your connection

02:59:29.000 --> 02:59:31.000
and then we know

02:59:31.000 --> 02:59:33.000
Or you can always use the trusty old regular

02:59:33.000 --> 02:59:35.000
telephone and you don't have to screw around with that too much

02:59:35.000 --> 02:59:37.000
1-877-GAME-OLR

02:59:37.000 --> 02:59:39.000
Meanwhile, while we wait for some calls

02:59:39.000 --> 02:59:41.000
to come in, are there any last minute stories?

02:59:41.000 --> 02:59:43.000
Yeah, Just Dance 2

02:59:43.000 --> 02:59:45.000
just announced the

02:59:45.000 --> 02:59:47.000
track list for that

02:59:47.000 --> 02:59:49.000
some songs that they have in there that you can

02:59:49.000 --> 02:59:51.000
dance to, I guess

02:59:51.000 --> 02:59:53.000
I'm getting hammered with calls, we better go to the calls

02:59:53.000 --> 02:59:55.000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

02:59:55.000 --> 02:59:57.000
Hello?

02:59:57.000 --> 02:59:59.000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

02:59:59.000 --> 03:00:01.000
It's Kine

03:00:01.000 --> 03:00:03.000
Hi, Kine, how are you?

03:00:03.000 --> 03:00:05.000
What's on your mind, buddy?

03:00:05.000 --> 03:00:07.000
Not too much

03:00:07.000 --> 03:00:09.000
I was calling in about

03:00:09.000 --> 03:00:11.000
the Poof Poof reference

03:00:11.000 --> 03:00:13.000
in Dragon Quest 9

03:00:13.000 --> 03:00:15.000
Yes, please, what about it?

03:00:17.000 --> 03:00:19.000
The reference

03:00:19.000 --> 03:00:21.000
in 3D Dot Game Heroes

03:00:21.000 --> 03:00:23.000
is actually from a previous Dragon Quest

03:00:23.000 --> 03:00:25.000
off of the NES

03:00:25.000 --> 03:00:27.000
Really?

03:00:27.000 --> 03:00:29.000
It was titled Dragon Warriors

03:00:29.000 --> 03:00:31.000
here in the States

03:00:31.000 --> 03:00:33.000
Yeah, and I can't remember which one it was

03:00:33.000 --> 03:00:35.000
but I think it was the first Dragon Warrior

03:00:35.000 --> 03:00:37.000
that came out

03:00:37.000 --> 03:00:39.000
I played it off the last one in the trilogy

03:00:39.000 --> 03:00:41.000
I didn't even catch

03:00:41.000 --> 03:00:43.000
that as being an original

03:00:43.000 --> 03:00:45.000
Dragon Warrior reference, I just thought it was

03:00:45.000 --> 03:00:47.000
funny, because don't they do this whole thing

03:00:47.000 --> 03:00:49.000
where they, like, in 3D Dot Game Heroes

03:00:49.000 --> 03:00:51.000
it's been a couple months since I played it, but don't they do this whole

03:00:51.000 --> 03:00:53.000
like little switcheroo thing where it ends up

03:00:53.000 --> 03:00:55.000
it's her dad giving the

03:00:55.000 --> 03:00:57.000
you know, massage or whatever they play it off

03:00:57.000 --> 03:00:59.000
that's going to get you mad?

03:00:59.000 --> 03:01:01.000
Yeah, and that's why I remember

03:01:01.000 --> 03:01:03.000
what I said, that's also the inside

03:01:03.000 --> 03:01:05.000
joke, there's a lot of Dragon

03:01:05.000 --> 03:01:07.000
Quest and all the references inside

03:01:07.000 --> 03:01:09.000
of that game

03:01:09.000 --> 03:01:11.000
In like the first round, you can go in the back

03:01:11.000 --> 03:01:13.000
and there's a slide and there must be

03:01:13.000 --> 03:01:15.000
humans from Dragon Quest 3

03:01:15.000 --> 03:01:17.000
so

03:01:17.000 --> 03:01:19.000
I thought

03:01:19.000 --> 03:01:21.000
No, I appreciate it, in fact

03:01:21.000 --> 03:01:23.000
it's kind of funny to know that now that

03:01:23.000 --> 03:01:25.000
that actually was from a

03:01:25.000 --> 03:01:27.000
another game, it was kind of another

03:01:27.000 --> 03:01:29.000
little reference and not just something they made up

03:01:29.000 --> 03:01:31.000
but I like that 3D Dot Game Heroes

03:01:31.000 --> 03:01:33.000
man, if you played, especially if you like

03:01:33.000 --> 03:01:35.000
actually grew up with the 8 and 16 bit games

03:01:35.000 --> 03:01:37.000
even if you didn't, if you have an appreciation for them

03:01:37.000 --> 03:01:39.000
but especially if you did like grow up with them

03:01:39.000 --> 03:01:41.000
I think they're just, like

03:01:41.000 --> 03:01:43.000
it's just a hilarious video game because it's made by

03:01:43.000 --> 03:01:45.000
nerds like you and me, clearly

03:01:45.000 --> 03:01:47.000
Yeah, it was

03:01:47.000 --> 03:01:49.000
definitely marked before

03:01:49.000 --> 03:01:51.000
people that grew up, you know

03:01:51.000 --> 03:01:53.000
in the 8 and 16 bit era

03:01:53.000 --> 03:01:55.000
Um

03:01:55.000 --> 03:01:57.000
Oh yeah, that was the other thing

03:01:57.000 --> 03:01:59.000
I demand a

03:01:59.000 --> 03:02:01.000
Commodore 64 episode

03:02:01.000 --> 03:02:03.000
Oh yes, I think I was joking about this

03:02:03.000 --> 03:02:05.000
on the forums, the Commodore 64 episode

03:02:05.000 --> 03:02:07.000
of OLR, well if we end up doing

03:02:07.000 --> 03:02:09.000
this whole marathon thing we're talking about for

03:02:09.000 --> 03:02:11.000
Labor Day, I'm gonna see what we can do about

03:02:11.000 --> 03:02:13.000
bringing some Commodore 64 content into it

03:02:13.000 --> 03:02:15.000
absolutely, maybe I'll make

03:02:15.000 --> 03:02:17.000
the cast sit down and play what would be a

03:02:17.000 --> 03:02:19.000
good old school Commodore 64

03:02:19.000 --> 03:02:21.000
game to make people play, we could actually, we could

03:02:21.000 --> 03:02:23.000
do a Summer Games 2

03:02:23.000 --> 03:02:25.000
Championship and we can all

03:02:25.000 --> 03:02:27.000
play the different

03:02:27.000 --> 03:02:29.000
countries, that would be awesome

03:02:29.000 --> 03:02:31.000
Alright, well Kyan, thank you so much for the call

03:02:31.000 --> 03:02:33.000
and have fun with 3D.GameHeroes

03:02:33.000 --> 03:02:35.000
it's a great value

03:02:35.000 --> 03:02:37.000
Alright, thank you

03:02:37.000 --> 03:02:39.000
Alright, later

03:02:39.000 --> 03:02:41.000
1877 Game OLR, if you'd like to give us a call

03:02:41.000 --> 03:02:43.000
or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio

03:02:43.000 --> 03:02:45.000
Let's go to another call, hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio

03:02:45.000 --> 03:02:47.000
Who's this?

03:02:47.000 --> 03:02:49.000
Hey, this is Butcher

03:02:49.000 --> 03:02:51.000
either on email or DarkKiske

03:02:51.000 --> 03:02:53.000
on Twitter

03:02:53.000 --> 03:02:55.000
Butcher or DarkKiske on Twitter

03:02:55.000 --> 03:02:57.000
What's on your mind?

03:02:57.000 --> 03:02:59.000
I just want to make this quick

03:02:59.000 --> 03:03:01.000
Thank you guys for giving me

03:03:01.000 --> 03:03:03.000
PSP game suggestions earlier

03:03:03.000 --> 03:03:05.000
Oh, this was your email, okay, yes

03:03:05.000 --> 03:03:07.000
And that's about it

03:03:07.000 --> 03:03:09.000
right now, but

03:03:09.000 --> 03:03:11.000
I had something else and it

03:03:11.000 --> 03:03:13.000
completely skipped my mind

03:03:13.000 --> 03:03:15.000
Uh oh, see

03:03:15.000 --> 03:03:17.000
this happens to us a lot when we do live radio

03:03:17.000 --> 03:03:19.000
is that we're actually doing a show and then we forget

03:03:19.000 --> 03:03:21.000
what we wanted to talk about, but that's why we always

03:03:21.000 --> 03:03:23.000
write things down before we

03:03:23.000 --> 03:03:25.000
do the show, but even then it sometimes

03:03:25.000 --> 03:03:27.000
doesn't help us, but okay, so

03:03:27.000 --> 03:03:29.000
you got, you were asking

03:03:29.000 --> 03:03:31.000
for the PSP games?

03:03:31.000 --> 03:03:33.000
Yeah, that was me

03:03:33.000 --> 03:03:35.000
Did any of those sound interesting to you? You think you might actually go out

03:03:35.000 --> 03:03:37.000
and pick any of those up?

03:03:37.000 --> 03:03:39.000
Yeah, once I actually get a job I'm probably going to go out

03:03:39.000 --> 03:03:41.000
and hunt down a few Final Fantasy games

03:03:41.000 --> 03:03:43.000
You know, unfortunately, that is the

03:03:43.000 --> 03:03:45.000
problem a lot of people are having right now in this economy

03:03:45.000 --> 03:03:47.000
is it's just, it's kind of ironic

03:03:47.000 --> 03:03:49.000
because we got that email about the high prices

03:03:49.000 --> 03:03:51.000
of games too, and

03:03:51.000 --> 03:03:53.000
it's just, you know, within this economy

03:03:53.000 --> 03:03:55.000
it's so hard to kind of afford

03:03:55.000 --> 03:03:57.000
a lot of that, and a couple weeks ago here on

03:03:57.000 --> 03:03:59.000
the show, it was about three weeks ago now, we had that gal

03:03:59.000 --> 03:04:01.000
and I'm so sorry, I forgot her name, what was her

03:04:01.000 --> 03:04:03.000
I remember her real name, but she went by something

03:04:03.000 --> 03:04:05.000
else here on the show, the gal who sat here

03:04:05.000 --> 03:04:07.000
the night Loki had the baby

03:04:07.000 --> 03:04:09.000
Oh, Ashley, um

03:04:09.000 --> 03:04:11.000
No, I forgot what her

03:04:11.000 --> 03:04:13.000
Yeah, her online name

03:04:13.000 --> 03:04:15.000
I forgot what her online name was, but Ashley

03:04:15.000 --> 03:04:17.000
Yeah, I knew that, but it's her online name, I couldn't remember

03:04:17.000 --> 03:04:19.000
But she was a big on the budget gamer

03:04:19.000 --> 03:04:21.000
She's going to be back

03:04:21.000 --> 03:04:23.000
Yeah, she likes the cheap games

03:04:23.000 --> 03:04:25.000
You know, there's a difference between cheap

03:04:25.000 --> 03:04:27.000
and piracy, and you know

03:04:27.000 --> 03:04:29.000
there's a lot of worthy cheap games out there

03:04:29.000 --> 03:04:31.000
and free ones, because she said she was a big player

03:04:31.000 --> 03:04:33.000
of what was it, like Runescape?

03:04:33.000 --> 03:04:35.000
Was that the game? And it's like free

03:04:35.000 --> 03:04:37.000
You can play that online

03:04:37.000 --> 03:04:39.000
Alright, well anyway, good luck with the PSP

03:04:39.000 --> 03:04:41.000
and let us know if you do find some good games

03:04:41.000 --> 03:04:43.000
to pass along to the listeners, let us know, alright?

03:04:43.000 --> 03:04:45.000
Yeah, sure thing

03:04:45.000 --> 03:04:47.000
Alright, take care buddy

03:04:47.000 --> 03:04:49.000
Oh yeah, go ahead

03:04:49.000 --> 03:04:51.000
Thanks to you, to you for getting my name wrong

03:04:51.000 --> 03:04:53.000
early on Twitter, it's not

03:04:53.000 --> 03:04:55.000
DarkKisuke, what did you say, Kisuke?

03:04:55.000 --> 03:04:57.000
Yeah

03:04:57.000 --> 03:04:59.000
Anyway, that's it

03:04:59.000 --> 03:05:01.000
Ah, I do my best, at least I read it

03:05:01.000 --> 03:05:03.000
Alright, take care, bye

03:05:03.000 --> 03:05:05.000
Alright, have a good night

03:05:05.000 --> 03:05:07.000
I try my best

03:05:07.000 --> 03:05:09.000
It's not spelled out phonetically

03:05:09.000 --> 03:05:11.000
I'm probably not going to get it

03:05:11.000 --> 03:05:13.000
We're getting a lot of calls tonight, but this is awesome

03:05:13.000 --> 03:05:15.000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

03:05:15.000 --> 03:05:17.000
Hello

03:05:17.000 --> 03:05:19.000
Oh, it's Xenocore

03:05:19.000 --> 03:05:21.000
Hey, how you doing? A little delay there, that's alright

03:05:21.000 --> 03:05:23.000
Hey, no problem man, it's been a long time

03:05:23.000 --> 03:05:25.000
I know it has, how are you doing Xenocore?

03:05:25.000 --> 03:05:27.000
Well, I've moved

03:05:27.000 --> 03:05:29.000
five states, uh

03:05:29.000 --> 03:05:31.000
managed to secure a job after three attempts

03:05:31.000 --> 03:05:33.000
and many layoffs, and now I'm

03:05:33.000 --> 03:05:35.000
working for Dell

03:05:35.000 --> 03:05:37.000
Well congratulations

03:05:37.000 --> 03:05:39.000
Well, doing army support

03:05:39.000 --> 03:05:41.000
Very cool, wait, you moved from where to where?

03:05:41.000 --> 03:05:43.000
You were in what, Virginia before?

03:05:43.000 --> 03:05:45.000
I was in, uh, I was in Sebastian, Florida

03:05:45.000 --> 03:05:47.000
Now I'm in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma

03:05:47.000 --> 03:05:49.000
Oh, wow, okay, that's quite a move

03:05:49.000 --> 03:05:51.000
Going from the east to the midwest

03:05:51.000 --> 03:05:53.000
Wow, alright, well

03:05:53.000 --> 03:05:55.000
How you liking Oklahoma? I've been there

03:05:55.000 --> 03:05:57.000
once, I was 17 years old

03:05:57.000 --> 03:05:59.000
Many years old

03:05:59.000 --> 03:06:01.000
It's pretty much like living on a space colony

03:06:01.000 --> 03:06:03.000
as close as you can imagine

03:06:03.000 --> 03:06:05.000
There's little things to do here and there of everything

03:06:05.000 --> 03:06:07.000
but you try to go outside the perimeter and there's

03:06:07.000 --> 03:06:09.000
nothing but wasteland

03:06:09.000 --> 03:06:11.000
Yeah, it's kind of isolated

03:06:11.000 --> 03:06:13.000
That's pretty much where it's at

03:06:13.000 --> 03:06:15.000
Well, what's on your mind tonight?

03:06:15.000 --> 03:06:17.000
Uh, not much, not much

03:06:17.000 --> 03:06:19.000
I'm actually getting ready to restart my

03:06:19.000 --> 03:06:21.000
show, and I've been writing

03:06:21.000 --> 03:06:23.000
for the Electra Sisterhood magazine

03:06:23.000 --> 03:06:25.000
in the meantime

03:06:25.000 --> 03:06:27.000
I have heard they launched a magazine

03:06:27.000 --> 03:06:29.000
and it's not an e-zine, right?

03:06:29.000 --> 03:06:31.000
It's an actual tangible super magazine, right?

03:06:31.000 --> 03:06:33.000
No, no

03:06:33.000 --> 03:06:35.000
You can get it in either form, they got it in PDF

03:06:35.000 --> 03:06:37.000
as well as print

03:06:37.000 --> 03:06:39.000
Wow, that's good for them, that can't be an easy venture

03:06:39.000 --> 03:06:41.000
for them, so

03:06:41.000 --> 03:06:43.000
I always seem to run into Ninja Sister at trade shows

03:06:43.000 --> 03:06:45.000
and I think she's adorable, I really like her

03:06:45.000 --> 03:06:47.000
She's been on some of the OLR special shows

03:06:47.000 --> 03:06:49.000
She's great

03:06:49.000 --> 03:06:51.000
Yeah, we're pimping everything out on landofesh.com

03:06:51.000 --> 03:06:53.000
now, so

03:06:53.000 --> 03:06:55.000
Oh, very nice, I didn't know there was a whole new website

03:06:55.000 --> 03:06:57.000
We'll go check that out, absolutely

03:06:57.000 --> 03:06:59.000
What kind of articles are you writing over there?

03:06:59.000 --> 03:07:01.000
Well, the last one I did was a review on how

03:07:01.000 --> 03:07:03.000
the marketing departments of all these games seem to

03:07:03.000 --> 03:07:05.000
love to play with the words

03:07:05.000 --> 03:07:07.000
and tell us what game is

03:07:07.000 --> 03:07:09.000
actually not that, like how I got

03:07:09.000 --> 03:07:11.000
pissed off with Demon Souls, I wrote all about it

03:07:11.000 --> 03:07:13.000
in there. Very interesting, because

03:07:13.000 --> 03:07:15.000
we were just talking earlier about

03:07:15.000 --> 03:07:17.000
and I apologize, this might not have been what you

03:07:17.000 --> 03:07:19.000
wanted to call in about, but we were talking a minute ago

03:07:19.000 --> 03:07:21.000
about how it seems like a lot of marketing

03:07:21.000 --> 03:07:23.000
departments don't actually play

03:07:23.000 --> 03:07:25.000
video games at all

03:07:25.000 --> 03:07:27.000
Oh yeah, that's corporate nature

03:07:27.000 --> 03:07:29.000
in general, they'll sell the stuff without even

03:07:29.000 --> 03:07:31.000
getting aware of what the hell they're selling

03:07:31.000 --> 03:07:33.000
Yeah, you think it would be better if they did?

03:07:33.000 --> 03:07:35.000
Eh, not

03:07:35.000 --> 03:07:37.000
really

03:07:37.000 --> 03:07:39.000
Sometimes it's just the mentality

03:07:39.000 --> 03:07:41.000
The guy who can survive doing sales for a living

03:07:41.000 --> 03:07:43.000
really doesn't have a lot of time to even

03:07:43.000 --> 03:07:45.000
play these things, so you know

03:07:45.000 --> 03:07:47.000
I just rope it up to that's the way the

03:07:47.000 --> 03:07:49.000
world is and keep going

03:07:49.000 --> 03:07:51.000
Gotcha. Well, I think I got us

03:07:51.000 --> 03:07:53.000
off on a tangent, but besides your

03:07:53.000 --> 03:07:55.000
work on ESH, what else is going on

03:07:55.000 --> 03:07:57.000
in your world that you might want

03:07:57.000 --> 03:07:59.000
to call in about tonight?

03:07:59.000 --> 03:08:01.000
Not much, not much. I did see

03:08:01.000 --> 03:08:03.000
Scott Pilgrim, but the one

03:08:03.000 --> 03:08:05.000
guy, actually I just recently saw it today and

03:08:05.000 --> 03:08:07.000
was quite happy. I started Facebooking all

03:08:07.000 --> 03:08:09.000
over the place for it, but the one

03:08:09.000 --> 03:08:11.000
thing that surprised me that I haven't

03:08:11.000 --> 03:08:13.000
seen before was the

03:08:13.000 --> 03:08:15.000
voice of reason and the

03:08:15.000 --> 03:08:17.000
guiding light in the entire show

03:08:17.000 --> 03:08:19.000
was Scott's

03:08:19.000 --> 03:08:21.000
roommate, and this is the best

03:08:21.000 --> 03:08:23.000
possible example I've seen of just

03:08:23.000 --> 03:08:25.000
a normal person who just

03:08:25.000 --> 03:08:27.000
happens to like guys too that's

03:08:27.000 --> 03:08:29.000
treated with a little bit more respect

03:08:29.000 --> 03:08:31.000
than I've seen in other mediums

03:08:31.000 --> 03:08:33.000
things getting better lately. I

03:08:33.000 --> 03:08:35.000
kind of agree with that, that was

03:08:35.000 --> 03:08:37.000
it was pretty cool the way that

03:08:37.000 --> 03:08:39.000
it was just like the cool

03:08:39.000 --> 03:08:41.000
gay friend and that's just the way it was, but I think it

03:08:41.000 --> 03:08:43.000
also shows like I kind of go

03:08:43.000 --> 03:08:45.000
back to the original comics and from

03:08:45.000 --> 03:08:47.000
what I've read on the original comics is that

03:08:47.000 --> 03:08:49.000
that character was inspired by a real

03:08:49.000 --> 03:08:51.000
life interaction that the

03:08:51.000 --> 03:08:53.000
author of the comics had with a former

03:08:53.000 --> 03:08:55.000
roommate of his. I think it just kind of goes

03:08:55.000 --> 03:08:57.000
to show that the younger generation

03:08:57.000 --> 03:08:59.000
especially, you know, and when I say that

03:08:59.000 --> 03:09:01.000
God I make myself sound so old, but just

03:09:01.000 --> 03:09:03.000
even folks that are like 10-15 years younger

03:09:03.000 --> 03:09:05.000
than us, like it's just not even an

03:09:05.000 --> 03:09:07.000
issue anymore. And if you look at the people who

03:09:07.000 --> 03:09:09.000
do have an issue with

03:09:09.000 --> 03:09:11.000
you know, same sex

03:09:11.000 --> 03:09:13.000
relations and what have you, it's almost always

03:09:13.000 --> 03:09:15.000
old fuddy duddies

03:09:15.000 --> 03:09:17.000
you know, like that

03:09:17.000 --> 03:09:19.000
I don't know why they're so threatened, but

03:09:19.000 --> 03:09:21.000
it's just comforting to know that you know

03:09:21.000 --> 03:09:23.000
especially a lot of the folks that listen to this show

03:09:23.000 --> 03:09:25.000
it's just whatever

03:09:25.000 --> 03:09:27.000
you know, it's just not even a big deal

03:09:27.000 --> 03:09:29.000
you know, so I think it's great

03:09:29.000 --> 03:09:31.000
cause that's the way it should be, it's just people like

03:09:31.000 --> 03:09:33.000
who they like, I don't even think

03:09:33.000 --> 03:09:35.000
you should have to be gay or

03:09:35.000 --> 03:09:37.000
straight, just be

03:09:37.000 --> 03:09:39.000
nice

03:09:39.000 --> 03:09:41.000
Exactly, exactly

03:09:41.000 --> 03:09:43.000
All we need

03:09:43.000 --> 03:09:45.000
And I have one gaming accomplishment I gotta share

03:09:45.000 --> 03:09:47.000
before I go, I managed

03:09:47.000 --> 03:09:49.000
to find a working

03:09:49.000 --> 03:09:51.000
version of Escape

03:09:51.000 --> 03:09:53.000
from the Planet of Robot Monsters

03:09:53.000 --> 03:09:55.000
and I got to the last dude and lost all the

03:09:55.000 --> 03:09:57.000
rest of my credits there, it was epic, I loved it

03:09:59.000 --> 03:10:01.000
How long did it take you to do that?

03:10:01.000 --> 03:10:03.000
It took me about a good hour

03:10:03.000 --> 03:10:05.000
but that game was

03:10:05.000 --> 03:10:07.000
jimmied so that way we could still use credits

03:10:07.000 --> 03:10:09.000
they took off the continue

03:10:09.000 --> 03:10:11.000
limitation and everything, I actually got pretty

03:10:11.000 --> 03:10:13.000
decent at it, but that game is brutal

03:10:13.000 --> 03:10:15.000
it's as brutal as it should and half these games

03:10:15.000 --> 03:10:17.000
that can only be played through MAME

03:10:17.000 --> 03:10:19.000
right now, they need to be re-released

03:10:19.000 --> 03:10:21.000
like whether on PSN or Xbox

03:10:21.000 --> 03:10:23.000
Live or whatever, at least the newer ones from like the

03:10:23.000 --> 03:10:25.000
late 90's and such

03:10:25.000 --> 03:10:27.000
but that's all I got

03:10:27.000 --> 03:10:29.000
keep gaming alive, excellent job guys

03:10:29.000 --> 03:10:31.000
I'll talk to you in the future

03:10:31.000 --> 03:10:33.000
Thank you so much for the phone call, I appreciate it buddy

03:10:33.000 --> 03:10:35.000
Have a good one

03:10:35.000 --> 03:10:37.000
Later, you too, bye bye

03:10:37.000 --> 03:10:39.000
We can take some more calls

03:10:39.000 --> 03:10:41.000
877-GAME-OLR

03:10:41.000 --> 03:10:43.000
or our username on Skype is orangeloungeradio

03:10:45.000 --> 03:10:47.000
and we'll

03:10:47.000 --> 03:10:49.000
take some more calls, looks like things finally

03:10:49.000 --> 03:10:51.000
slowed up here for a minute, we can get back to the

03:10:51.000 --> 03:10:53.000
Dance 2 story if you want

03:10:53.000 --> 03:10:55.000
Some of the songs in there, including some of the

03:10:55.000 --> 03:10:57.000
really annoying songs, they've

03:10:57.000 --> 03:10:59.000
got

03:10:59.000 --> 03:11:01.000
let's see here, Kesha

03:11:01.000 --> 03:11:03.000
with TikTok

03:11:03.000 --> 03:11:05.000
OutKast with

03:11:05.000 --> 03:11:07.000
I was just thinking there's not enough gutter

03:11:07.000 --> 03:11:09.000
trash on the Wii

03:11:09.000 --> 03:11:11.000
The Pussycat Dolls

03:11:11.000 --> 03:11:13.000
When I Grow Up

03:11:15.000 --> 03:11:17.000
I don't recognize a lot

03:11:17.000 --> 03:11:19.000
of these songs

03:11:19.000 --> 03:11:21.000
Avril Lavigne, Girlfriend

03:11:23.000 --> 03:11:25.000
Let's see here

03:11:25.000 --> 03:11:27.000
Bonnie M. Rasputin

03:11:29.000 --> 03:11:31.000
Cher the Shoop Shoop song

03:11:31.000 --> 03:11:33.000
Donna Summer's

03:11:33.000 --> 03:11:35.000
Hot Stuff

03:11:37.000 --> 03:11:39.000
This game sounds more and more like a 70's

03:11:39.000 --> 03:11:41.000
disco with each song that you read

03:11:41.000 --> 03:11:43.000
Ike and Tina Turner, Proud Mary

03:11:43.000 --> 03:11:45.000
Wow, alright look

03:11:45.000 --> 03:11:47.000
we're gonna go to a phone call to save this

03:11:47.000 --> 03:11:49.000
We also have Justice with D.A.N.C.E

03:11:49.000 --> 03:11:51.000
and that song is awesome

03:11:51.000 --> 03:11:53.000
Hi you're on Orange Lawn's Radio, who's this?

03:11:53.000 --> 03:11:55.000
Hey it's Ron, how's everyone doing tonight?

03:11:55.000 --> 03:11:57.000
I am great, how are you?

03:11:57.000 --> 03:11:59.000
I'm good

03:11:59.000 --> 03:12:01.000
Before we get to you Loki

03:12:01.000 --> 03:12:03.000
congratulations

03:12:03.000 --> 03:12:05.000
Thank you

03:12:05.000 --> 03:12:07.000
You're welcome

03:12:07.000 --> 03:12:09.000
I saw Scott Pilgrim vs.

03:12:09.000 --> 03:12:11.000
the World on Saturday

03:12:11.000 --> 03:12:13.000
I enjoyed the movie but

03:12:13.000 --> 03:12:15.000
the only issue

03:12:15.000 --> 03:12:17.000
that I had

03:12:17.000 --> 03:12:19.000
maybe because it's my

03:12:19.000 --> 03:12:21.000
ginormous ego and my portrayal

03:12:21.000 --> 03:12:23.000
and my odd views of the world

03:12:23.000 --> 03:12:25.000
I just didn't like how

03:12:25.000 --> 03:12:27.000
Scott Pilgrim was portrayed

03:12:27.000 --> 03:12:29.000
as this socially inept

03:12:29.000 --> 03:12:31.000
awkward geek

03:12:31.000 --> 03:12:33.000
maybe it's because of the people that

03:12:33.000 --> 03:12:35.000
I've run with throughout the years

03:12:35.000 --> 03:12:37.000
I've never come across anybody

03:12:37.000 --> 03:12:39.000
as bad as him

03:12:39.000 --> 03:12:41.000
I can see that

03:12:41.000 --> 03:12:43.000
Yeah

03:12:43.000 --> 03:12:45.000
Yeah

03:12:45.000 --> 03:12:47.000
To me

03:12:47.000 --> 03:12:49.000
Isn't that kind of what Michael Cera is

03:12:49.000 --> 03:12:51.000
in every movie he's in?

03:12:51.000 --> 03:12:53.000
and Arrested Development to some extent

03:12:53.000 --> 03:12:55.000
Michael Cera needs a shot

03:12:55.000 --> 03:12:57.000
Jesse Hinesburg should have been in that movie

03:12:57.000 --> 03:12:59.000
He was the kid from

03:12:59.000 --> 03:13:01.000
Zombie Land

03:13:03.000 --> 03:13:05.000
Yeah I know

03:13:05.000 --> 03:13:07.000
What's funny is people think

03:13:07.000 --> 03:13:09.000
that Michael Cera was in Zombieland

03:13:09.000 --> 03:13:11.000
because they keep mistaking both guys

03:13:11.000 --> 03:13:13.000
I'm like no that's two separate people

03:13:13.000 --> 03:13:15.000
Hehehe

03:13:15.000 --> 03:13:17.000
But did you like

03:13:17.000 --> 03:13:19.000
otherwise besides the whole

03:13:19.000 --> 03:13:21.000
main character which is funny enough

03:13:21.000 --> 03:13:23.000
was one of the big problems I had with the movie

03:13:23.000 --> 03:13:25.000
did you kind of like everything else about it?

03:13:25.000 --> 03:13:27.000
Yeah I did

03:13:27.000 --> 03:13:29.000
I even had to convince my best friend

03:13:29.000 --> 03:13:31.000
to watch the movie

03:13:31.000 --> 03:13:33.000
so maybe her view will be a little bit different

03:13:33.000 --> 03:13:35.000
if she watches it

03:13:35.000 --> 03:13:37.000
Yeah

03:13:37.000 --> 03:13:39.000
It's kind of a bummer

03:13:39.000 --> 03:13:41.000
that it's doing so terribly at the box office

03:13:41.000 --> 03:13:43.000
because you know

03:13:43.000 --> 03:13:45.000
I feel like people will never try to do

03:13:45.000 --> 03:13:47.000
another movie like it

03:13:47.000 --> 03:13:49.000
Why do you think the movie is bombing so terribly?

03:13:49.000 --> 03:13:51.000
Simply put

03:13:51.000 --> 03:13:53.000
it went up against The Expendables

03:13:53.000 --> 03:13:55.000
and Julia Roberts

03:13:55.000 --> 03:13:57.000
That's the only reason why it tanked out

03:13:57.000 --> 03:13:59.000
Now if it went up

03:13:59.000 --> 03:14:01.000
if it was out during an off season

03:14:01.000 --> 03:14:03.000
it would have done good

03:14:03.000 --> 03:14:05.000
because personally when I saw the poster

03:14:05.000 --> 03:14:07.000
I'm like hmm maybe

03:14:07.000 --> 03:14:09.000
I'm like okay I'll go see this

03:14:09.000 --> 03:14:11.000
then The Expendables happens to show up

03:14:11.000 --> 03:14:13.000
I'm like this is my 80's childhood right here

03:14:13.000 --> 03:14:15.000
80's childhood

03:14:15.000 --> 03:14:17.000
versus

03:14:17.000 --> 03:14:19.000
geekdom geek fandom versus 80's childhood

03:14:19.000 --> 03:14:21.000
Yeah exactly

03:14:21.000 --> 03:14:23.000
and I'm asking people

03:14:23.000 --> 03:14:25.000
give me faith in the movie

03:14:25.000 --> 03:14:27.000
don't give me reasons to see it

03:14:27.000 --> 03:14:29.000
just give me faith in it

03:14:29.000 --> 03:14:31.000
unfortunately there was no faith

03:14:31.000 --> 03:14:33.000
For me with The Expendables

03:14:33.000 --> 03:14:35.000
it's like wow everything I don't

03:14:35.000 --> 03:14:37.000
like about 80's movies in one movie

03:14:37.000 --> 03:14:39.000
I'm like there's the perfect movie for me to

03:14:39.000 --> 03:14:41.000
not see

03:14:41.000 --> 03:14:43.000
At least that's

03:14:43.000 --> 03:14:45.000
how I felt about it but you know

03:14:45.000 --> 03:14:47.000
Well

03:14:47.000 --> 03:14:49.000
at least I'm happy that

03:14:49.000 --> 03:14:51.000
the movie is getting a sequel but you know that's just me

03:14:51.000 --> 03:14:53.000
Alright

03:14:53.000 --> 03:14:55.000
Alright

03:14:55.000 --> 03:14:57.000
anything else you want to share with the

03:14:57.000 --> 03:14:59.000
listeners tonight?

03:14:59.000 --> 03:15:01.000
I picked up another DJ Hero

03:15:01.000 --> 03:15:03.000
turntable controller for 20 bucks

03:15:03.000 --> 03:15:05.000
and I'm looking forward to DJ Hero 2

03:15:07.000 --> 03:15:09.000
Yeah now's a good time to get a

03:15:09.000 --> 03:15:11.000
turntable controller if you have any interest in DJ Hero 2

03:15:11.000 --> 03:15:13.000
because you could probably get the turntable by itself

03:15:13.000 --> 03:15:15.000
and then DJ Hero 2 by itself

03:15:15.000 --> 03:15:17.000
for much cheaper

03:15:17.000 --> 03:15:19.000
than the combo

03:15:19.000 --> 03:15:21.000
Maybe because I think it was only on sale

03:15:21.000 --> 03:15:23.000
with Best Buy and Kmart

03:15:23.000 --> 03:15:25.000
for like two weeks only

03:15:25.000 --> 03:15:27.000
and now I've been checking prices

03:15:27.000 --> 03:15:29.000
it's back at the regular price and my turntable

03:15:29.000 --> 03:15:31.000
control was on back order for about a week and a half

03:15:31.000 --> 03:15:33.000
Tekken 6 is on sale for 10 bucks

03:15:33.000 --> 03:15:35.000
at Best Buy

03:15:35.000 --> 03:15:37.000
Much better than 60

03:15:37.000 --> 03:15:39.000
If you have the $28 coupon card

03:15:39.000 --> 03:15:41.000
which you can print out

03:15:41.000 --> 03:15:43.000
Alright Rob we're going to let you go so we can

03:15:43.000 --> 03:15:45.000
try and get at least one more call in here before we sign off

03:15:45.000 --> 03:15:47.000
for the night but thanks so much for your call okay buddy?

03:15:47.000 --> 03:15:49.000
Not the problem Luigi

03:15:49.000 --> 03:15:51.000
out here

03:15:51.000 --> 03:15:53.000
Alright bye take care

03:15:53.000 --> 03:15:55.000
Let's see one more call here

03:15:55.000 --> 03:15:57.000
I'm going to try to get to tonight. Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio

03:15:57.000 --> 03:15:59.000
who's this?

03:15:59.000 --> 03:16:01.000
DJ Blaziken

03:16:01.000 --> 03:16:03.000
DJ Blaziken what is on your mind?

03:16:03.000 --> 03:16:05.000
Not much

03:16:05.000 --> 03:16:07.000
other than some possible new game

03:16:07.000 --> 03:16:09.000
for Butcher to pick up when he gets in cash

03:16:09.000 --> 03:16:11.000
Actually

03:16:11.000 --> 03:16:13.000
these games went down to like

03:16:13.000 --> 03:16:15.000
10 bucks

03:16:15.000 --> 03:16:17.000
and they are

03:16:17.000 --> 03:16:19.000
Twisted Metal

03:16:19.000 --> 03:16:21.000
I think

03:16:21.000 --> 03:16:23.000
they even dropped

03:16:23.000 --> 03:16:25.000
I think it's

03:16:25.000 --> 03:16:27.000
I think it's

03:16:27.000 --> 03:16:29.000
It was Quiz World for $7.99

03:16:29.000 --> 03:16:31.000
on PSN

03:16:31.000 --> 03:16:33.000
and then

03:16:33.000 --> 03:16:35.000
oh yeah

03:16:35.000 --> 03:16:37.000
Beats

03:16:37.000 --> 03:16:39.000
which I also have a

03:16:39.000 --> 03:16:41.000
review for

03:16:41.000 --> 03:16:43.000
which it's kind of like

03:16:43.000 --> 03:16:45.000
if you were to take

03:16:45.000 --> 03:16:47.000
oh

03:16:47.000 --> 03:16:49.000
Beatmania and just have three lines

03:16:51.000 --> 03:16:53.000
that's what Beats is but the cool thing is

03:16:53.000 --> 03:16:55.000
it's kind of like Stepmania

03:16:55.000 --> 03:16:57.000
or ITG

03:16:57.000 --> 03:16:59.000
where you can use your own music and

03:16:59.000 --> 03:17:01.000
it goes off your memory card

03:17:01.000 --> 03:17:03.000
like your whole music library

03:17:03.000 --> 03:17:05.000
that you got on there

03:17:05.000 --> 03:17:07.000
A lot of those games that make their own music

03:17:07.000 --> 03:17:09.000
and I reviewed one here on the show just like I think

03:17:09.000 --> 03:17:11.000
a couple weeks ago we were last on the air

03:17:11.000 --> 03:17:13.000
there's that game that was on Steam like

03:17:13.000 --> 03:17:15.000
Rhythm Zone or something like that that uses your own

03:17:15.000 --> 03:17:17.000
MP3's and it's

03:17:17.000 --> 03:17:19.000
Bootsy to use a word that Irene uses a lot

03:17:19.000 --> 03:17:21.000
it's a Bootsy game because like

03:17:21.000 --> 03:17:23.000
the note patterns that come up with the music you make

03:17:23.000 --> 03:17:25.000
are just not interesting

03:17:25.000 --> 03:17:27.000
yet a game like Audio Surf

03:17:27.000 --> 03:17:29.000
I think is actually a lot better

03:17:29.000 --> 03:17:31.000
and it makes its own patterns too

03:17:31.000 --> 03:17:33.000
based on the MP3's you're playing but you're not

03:17:33.000 --> 03:17:35.000
hitting buttons at random

03:17:35.000 --> 03:17:37.000
like flailing on your keyboard in time

03:17:37.000 --> 03:17:39.000
to the music. Audio Surf the game

03:17:39.000 --> 03:17:41.000
is kind of different it's like a puzzle game mixed

03:17:41.000 --> 03:17:43.000
with music mixed with action

03:17:43.000 --> 03:17:45.000
I don't know it's different so it works for me

03:17:45.000 --> 03:17:47.000
but I mean is this other game

03:17:47.000 --> 03:17:49.000
you're talking about button flailing or what?

03:17:49.000 --> 03:17:51.000
Okay

03:17:51.000 --> 03:17:53.000
actually but this one though

03:17:53.000 --> 03:17:55.000
it uses all four

03:17:55.000 --> 03:17:57.000
the extra circle square buttons on your PSP

03:17:57.000 --> 03:17:59.000
and

03:17:59.000 --> 03:18:01.000
but the cool thing is

03:18:01.000 --> 03:18:03.000
well here's the only jip of it

03:18:03.000 --> 03:18:05.000
I tried to play along with some of my

03:18:05.000 --> 03:18:07.000
DDR soundtrack songs

03:18:07.000 --> 03:18:09.000
it won't work with them. It doesn't work with

03:18:09.000 --> 03:18:11.000
anything under

03:18:11.000 --> 03:18:13.000
two or three minutes

03:18:13.000 --> 03:18:15.000
Oh that's weird

03:18:15.000 --> 03:18:17.000
so I hate to say it for all you

03:18:17.000 --> 03:18:19.000
B-Money fans who wanted to use your

03:18:19.000 --> 03:18:21.000
B-Money soundtracks

03:18:21.000 --> 03:18:23.000
for beats you're out of luck

03:18:23.000 --> 03:18:25.000
That is kind of weird that it

03:18:25.000 --> 03:18:27.000
won't work for such short songs

03:18:27.000 --> 03:18:29.000
I wonder if that has to do with some type of like scoring

03:18:29.000 --> 03:18:31.000
algorithm or

03:18:31.000 --> 03:18:33.000
I can't even think of achievements

03:18:33.000 --> 03:18:35.000
It's a scoring system but yet it'll work

03:18:35.000 --> 03:18:37.000
with stuff like

03:18:37.000 --> 03:18:39.000
the Initial V soundtrack

03:18:39.000 --> 03:18:41.000
which I have

03:18:41.000 --> 03:18:43.000
and like the only

03:18:43.000 --> 03:18:45.000
B-Money song I have on there from

03:18:45.000 --> 03:18:47.000
that which

03:18:47.000 --> 03:18:49.000
I think everyone knows Night of Fire

03:18:49.000 --> 03:18:51.000
of course

03:18:51.000 --> 03:18:53.000
you know and

03:18:53.000 --> 03:18:55.000
a lot of the old DDR songs

03:18:55.000 --> 03:18:57.000
and I mean old old old DDR songs

03:18:57.000 --> 03:18:59.000
came from a series in Japan

03:18:59.000 --> 03:19:01.000
called Dance Mania X not to be

03:19:01.000 --> 03:19:03.000
confused with Dance Maniacs

03:19:03.000 --> 03:19:05.000
or just the Dance Mania albums

03:19:05.000 --> 03:19:07.000
and if you can go to those albums

03:19:07.000 --> 03:19:09.000
you can find a lot of longer

03:19:09.000 --> 03:19:11.000
versions of old school B-Money songs

03:19:11.000 --> 03:19:13.000
because they were all trimmed down from

03:19:13.000 --> 03:19:15.000
CD cuts that were three or four minutes

03:19:15.000 --> 03:19:17.000
long

03:19:17.000 --> 03:19:19.000
Wow I had no clue

03:19:19.000 --> 03:19:21.000
of that. There you go you learn something

03:19:21.000 --> 03:19:23.000
new every day. Alright

03:19:23.000 --> 03:19:25.000
Yeah Dance Maniacs

03:19:25.000 --> 03:19:27.000
I do have one

03:19:27.000 --> 03:19:29.000
and so

03:19:29.000 --> 03:19:31.000
basically I was just

03:19:31.000 --> 03:19:33.000
wondering what the heck else

03:19:33.000 --> 03:19:35.000
you know oh yeah

03:19:35.000 --> 03:19:37.000
even though it's import only

03:19:37.000 --> 03:19:39.000
but I say it's worth it

03:19:39.000 --> 03:19:41.000
if you love racing games

03:19:41.000 --> 03:19:43.000
a lot of stuff like Ridge Racer might be starting to get tired

03:19:43.000 --> 03:19:45.000
of it but also loves anime

03:19:45.000 --> 03:19:47.000
Initial D

03:19:47.000 --> 03:19:49.000
Street Stage

03:19:49.000 --> 03:19:51.000
with

03:19:51.000 --> 03:19:53.000
PSP

03:19:53.000 --> 03:19:55.000
which

03:19:55.000 --> 03:19:57.000
I don't know where else to get that because

03:19:57.000 --> 03:19:59.000
nowhere

03:19:59.000 --> 03:20:01.000
sells it here in America

03:20:01.000 --> 03:20:03.000
Well if it's not something

03:20:03.000 --> 03:20:05.000
you can get on the Playstation

03:20:05.000 --> 03:20:07.000
store you have to

03:20:07.000 --> 03:20:09.000
kind of go the harder routes of trying to find

03:20:09.000 --> 03:20:11.000
Fish Up a Copy on eBay or Amazon

03:20:11.000 --> 03:20:13.000
or one of those but they're you know

03:20:13.000 --> 03:20:15.000
the internet really

03:20:15.000 --> 03:20:17.000
so

03:20:17.000 --> 03:20:19.000
Alright well anything else on your mind buddy before we let you

03:20:19.000 --> 03:20:21.000
go

03:20:21.000 --> 03:20:23.000
Hey I got a little question

03:20:23.000 --> 03:20:25.000
for you on the fact

03:20:25.000 --> 03:20:27.000
you're like I saw

03:20:27.000 --> 03:20:29.000
something that was back on the old

03:20:29.000 --> 03:20:31.000
games and it said a little thing on your profile like

03:20:31.000 --> 03:20:33.000
you had some previous college and high school

03:20:33.000 --> 03:20:35.000
broadcasting experience

03:20:35.000 --> 03:20:37.000
and I got asked this too

03:20:37.000 --> 03:20:39.000
what got you interested in broadcasting

03:20:39.000 --> 03:20:41.000
That's a really good

03:20:41.000 --> 03:20:43.000
question

03:20:43.000 --> 03:20:45.000
That's because Rob

03:20:45.000 --> 03:20:47.000
is a big attention whore

03:20:47.000 --> 03:20:49.000
Partially that

03:20:49.000 --> 03:20:51.000
Here's the thing when I was in college

03:20:51.000 --> 03:20:53.000
No I know but no part of it is I'm

03:20:53.000 --> 03:20:55.000
an attention whore I do I like the

03:20:55.000 --> 03:20:57.000
getting the like for instance last night

03:20:57.000 --> 03:20:59.000
at the Rocky thing that I was doing

03:20:59.000 --> 03:21:01.000
I got to lead you know four thousand

03:21:01.000 --> 03:21:03.000
some odd give or take a few thousand

03:21:03.000 --> 03:21:05.000
in doing the time warp and that felt

03:21:05.000 --> 03:21:07.000
awesome like just you know like all the

03:21:07.000 --> 03:21:09.000
people doing you know what I'm telling them to do

03:21:09.000 --> 03:21:11.000
is just kind of cool like you know

03:21:11.000 --> 03:21:13.000
it was cool but to be honest

03:21:13.000 --> 03:21:15.000
where that all comes from I got into

03:21:15.000 --> 03:21:17.000
radio in college because I actually originally

03:21:17.000 --> 03:21:19.000
originally originally was studying

03:21:19.000 --> 03:21:21.000
to do computer science because you know I'm a nerd

03:21:21.000 --> 03:21:23.000
I thought I'd like computers but for me

03:21:23.000 --> 03:21:25.000
wasn't for me I didn't like it it's for other

03:21:25.000 --> 03:21:27.000
people but not for me I actually had a really bad

03:21:27.000 --> 03:21:29.000
professor that I think kind of just turned me off of the whole

03:21:29.000 --> 03:21:31.000
thing but I switched

03:21:31.000 --> 03:21:33.000
to studying television I was

03:21:33.000 --> 03:21:35.000
actually wanting to be for a little bit I wanted to be a weather

03:21:35.000 --> 03:21:37.000
man and then I was going to be a broadcast

03:21:37.000 --> 03:21:39.000
journalist and I actually interned for a little while

03:21:39.000 --> 03:21:41.000
at a CBS station up where I went to school

03:21:41.000 --> 03:21:43.000
but I found that the

03:21:43.000 --> 03:21:45.000
television industry from my perspective

03:21:45.000 --> 03:21:47.000
from doing all that again for me

03:21:47.000 --> 03:21:49.000
you know obviously there's people that are into it but for me

03:21:49.000 --> 03:21:51.000
too competitive and too cut throat and

03:21:51.000 --> 03:21:53.000
you know kind of the same thing with radio to some extent

03:21:53.000 --> 03:21:55.000
but when I was doing college radio I kind of

03:21:55.000 --> 03:21:57.000
got to do things on my own terms and you know

03:21:57.000 --> 03:21:59.000
it didn't matter if no one was listening even if one

03:21:59.000 --> 03:22:01.000
person was listening it was hilarious

03:22:01.000 --> 03:22:03.000
and got to have fun doing it so

03:22:03.000 --> 03:22:05.000
when internet radio came about it seemed like a real

03:22:05.000 --> 03:22:07.000
natural progression although to be fair

03:22:07.000 --> 03:22:09.000
I think without Travis

03:22:09.000 --> 03:22:11.000
having kind of helped me make that

03:22:11.000 --> 03:22:13.000
transition he's the host of

03:22:13.000 --> 03:22:15.000
Under Station Alive I don't know if I would've

03:22:15.000 --> 03:22:17.000
gotten into internet radio as quickly

03:22:17.000 --> 03:22:19.000
as I did I think I would've

03:22:19.000 --> 03:22:21.000
gotten here eventually

03:22:21.000 --> 03:22:23.000
but I don't think I would've gotten into it

03:22:23.000 --> 03:22:25.000
as quickly as I did outside of school but if

03:22:25.000 --> 03:22:27.000
I actually wanted to go way way back and I don't think

03:22:27.000 --> 03:22:29.000
I've talked about this a lot on the show but way

03:22:29.000 --> 03:22:31.000
back in high school a friend

03:22:31.000 --> 03:22:33.000
of mine used to have a public access show we

03:22:33.000 --> 03:22:35.000
actually did on the local television

03:22:35.000 --> 03:22:37.000
station so I actually had a TV show for about

03:22:37.000 --> 03:22:39.000
two years my good

03:22:39.000 --> 03:22:41.000
friend in high school and I actually produced this show

03:22:41.000 --> 03:22:43.000
that we did it had nothing to do with video games it was more like a

03:22:43.000 --> 03:22:45.000
little comedy show that we did just because we could

03:22:45.000 --> 03:22:47.000
and it was great we got turned

03:22:47.000 --> 03:22:49.000
on it was great there are very few

03:22:49.000 --> 03:22:51.000
copies out there in existence and I am

03:22:51.000 --> 03:22:53.000
very very

03:22:53.000 --> 03:22:55.000
careful to not let that hit the internet

03:22:55.000 --> 03:22:57.000
because I just don't want it out there they're all in your

03:22:57.000 --> 03:22:59.000
mom's garage right ah somewhere

03:22:59.000 --> 03:23:01.000
yeah my

03:23:01.000 --> 03:23:03.000
friend Shannon would have copies of every

03:23:03.000 --> 03:23:05.000
episode somewhere and my

03:23:05.000 --> 03:23:07.000
mother has them somewhere although I don't know where they

03:23:07.000 --> 03:23:09.000
are and the tapes probably melted by now and I've

03:23:09.000 --> 03:23:11.000
YouTube I nope nope

03:23:11.000 --> 03:23:13.000
that's I will not let them out because I do not

03:23:13.000 --> 03:23:15.000
want them on YouTube because unfortunately

03:23:15.000 --> 03:23:17.000
now that I do have this show

03:23:17.000 --> 03:23:19.000
I think if people were to see that

03:23:19.000 --> 03:23:21.000
I just it's no

03:23:21.000 --> 03:23:23.000
and granted it would be a pain

03:23:23.000 --> 03:23:25.000
in the ass to rip that from

03:23:25.000 --> 03:23:27.000
video tape right now yeah

03:23:27.000 --> 03:23:29.000
but unfortunately if it fell in the wrong hands it would

03:23:29.000 --> 03:23:31.000
be done sooner than I would like it

03:23:31.000 --> 03:23:33.000
to happen I'm not it's not

03:23:33.000 --> 03:23:35.000
that I'm necessarily like embarrassed or whatever

03:23:35.000 --> 03:23:37.000
but it's just you know what it's just not

03:23:37.000 --> 03:23:39.000
what I do now

03:23:39.000 --> 03:23:41.000
ah so ah

03:23:41.000 --> 03:23:43.000
yeah but I did that show and that was a lot of fun and

03:23:43.000 --> 03:23:45.000
the whole reason I got into that in the first place

03:23:45.000 --> 03:23:47.000
what I wanted to get to to answer your question

03:23:47.000 --> 03:23:49.000
ah I had

03:23:49.000 --> 03:23:51.000
a substitute teacher one day

03:23:51.000 --> 03:23:53.000
in a physics class and he came in

03:23:53.000 --> 03:23:55.000
and he was actually trying to do his little like

03:23:55.000 --> 03:23:57.000
emotional thing like you know because the public access

03:23:57.000 --> 03:23:59.000
station was kind of hurting for more volunteers

03:23:59.000 --> 03:24:01.000
and so forth and he was actually showing us a

03:24:01.000 --> 03:24:03.000
video that he did like a music

03:24:03.000 --> 03:24:05.000
video and my friend and I looked at each

03:24:05.000 --> 03:24:07.000
other and thought this is so

03:24:07.000 --> 03:24:09.000
like

03:24:09.000 --> 03:24:11.000
ghetto that like if

03:24:11.000 --> 03:24:13.000
he can do this we can do this

03:24:13.000 --> 03:24:15.000
and that was honestly what got us

03:24:15.000 --> 03:24:17.000
into it so we should do public

03:24:17.000 --> 03:24:19.000
access that'd be hilarious it's so

03:24:19.000 --> 03:24:21.000
funny to me now to hear when people

03:24:21.000 --> 03:24:23.000
say man orange

03:24:23.000 --> 03:24:25.000
launch radio and I've had people say this and it's like the

03:24:25.000 --> 03:24:27.000
ultimate compliment I can get orange

03:24:27.000 --> 03:24:29.000
launch radio like got me into doing what I'm

03:24:29.000 --> 03:24:31.000
doing today because I heard it and I was like

03:24:31.000 --> 03:24:33.000
I want to do something like that actually

03:24:33.000 --> 03:24:35.000
actually that is

03:24:35.000 --> 03:24:37.000
you guys are kind of my inspiration

03:24:37.000 --> 03:24:39.000
I've listened to you guys since

03:24:39.000 --> 03:24:41.000
oh my god what was it episode 50

03:24:41.000 --> 03:24:43.000
back in the old live 365

03:24:43.000 --> 03:24:45.000
station which I did mention in a

03:24:45.000 --> 03:24:47.000
beatmania review for KIOS

03:24:47.000 --> 03:24:49.000
915

03:24:49.000 --> 03:24:51.000
here in Omaha

03:24:51.000 --> 03:24:53.000
and I actually mentioned your guys

03:24:53.000 --> 03:24:55.000
old bemonnie more show

03:24:55.000 --> 03:24:57.000
awesome because of course I was

03:24:57.000 --> 03:24:59.000
reviewing beatmania so I figured

03:24:59.000 --> 03:25:01.000
you know if you like you know the stuff that you

03:25:01.000 --> 03:25:03.000
hear of the clubs during the rave period

03:25:03.000 --> 03:25:05.000
or the stuff that you might have heard way back

03:25:05.000 --> 03:25:07.000
when on orange launch radio bemonnie

03:25:07.000 --> 03:25:09.000
more show

03:25:09.000 --> 03:25:11.000
go up this game woohoo

03:25:11.000 --> 03:25:13.000
well thank you for the plug I appreciate it

03:25:13.000 --> 03:25:15.000
that is awesome and so

03:25:15.000 --> 03:25:17.000
but I just hope I'm on KIOS

03:25:17.000 --> 03:25:19.000

um jazz from studio 1

03:25:27.000 --> 03:25:29.000
is the show that I'm going to be on

03:25:29.000 --> 03:25:31.000
um and then a few other

03:25:31.000 --> 03:25:33.000
broadcasting students

03:25:33.000 --> 03:25:35.000
I'm getting the first show

03:25:35.000 --> 03:25:37.000
October 7th well best of luck

03:25:37.000 --> 03:25:39.000
to you that is awesome

03:25:39.000 --> 03:25:41.000
but I laugh because when people

03:25:41.000 --> 03:25:43.000
when people tell me that I think

03:25:43.000 --> 03:25:45.000
back to the video I saw in high school and I go

03:25:45.000 --> 03:25:47.000
I hope people aren't saying I was inspired by

03:25:47.000 --> 03:25:49.000
orange launch radio because they thought this show

03:25:49.000 --> 03:25:51.000
was so terrible and ghetto

03:25:51.000 --> 03:25:53.000
I can see that

03:25:53.000 --> 03:25:55.000
but even if that's the reason then more

03:25:55.000 --> 03:25:57.000
power to you I don't even care

03:25:57.000 --> 03:25:59.000
I think it's great actually I had somebody tell me to my

03:25:59.000 --> 03:26:01.000
face that they got into public access

03:26:01.000 --> 03:26:03.000
because they thought my old TV show

03:26:03.000 --> 03:26:05.000
they said blah blah blah was so

03:26:05.000 --> 03:26:07.000
terrible and so awful

03:26:07.000 --> 03:26:09.000
that you guys really inspired me to do this and I

03:26:09.000 --> 03:26:11.000
was like oh thank you

03:26:11.000 --> 03:26:13.000
alright

03:26:13.000 --> 03:26:15.000

03:26:21.000 --> 03:26:23.000

03:26:25.000 --> 03:26:27.000

the shop for the night although I do want to make sure

03:26:45.000 --> 03:26:47.000
Loki gets out any other last minute stories he wants

03:26:47.000 --> 03:26:49.000
um just really quick

03:26:49.000 --> 03:26:51.000
I was going to say um

03:26:51.000 --> 03:26:53.000
there's also the a partial

03:26:53.000 --> 03:26:55.000
track list for the Michael Jackson

03:26:55.000 --> 03:26:57.000
um game the Michael Jackson

03:26:57.000 --> 03:26:59.000
the experience and the first

03:26:59.000 --> 03:27:01.000
few songs from Michael Jackson that'll be

03:27:01.000 --> 03:27:03.000
in the game of course Bad

03:27:03.000 --> 03:27:05.000
Beat It, Billie Jean, The Earth Song

03:27:05.000 --> 03:27:07.000
The Girl Is Mine, Who Is It

03:27:07.000 --> 03:27:09.000
and Workin' Day and Night

03:27:09.000 --> 03:27:11.000
Workin' Day and Night's the only one I don't

03:27:11.000 --> 03:27:13.000
recognize but

03:27:13.000 --> 03:27:15.000
I'm sure I've heard it I just don't recognize

03:27:15.000 --> 03:27:17.000
it by the title

03:27:17.000 --> 03:27:19.000
um yeah so that's it

03:27:19.000 --> 03:27:21.000
they have some really stupid looking

03:27:21.000 --> 03:27:23.000
you know how they do those lifestyle

03:27:23.000 --> 03:27:25.000
shots where they have like someone playing the game

03:27:25.000 --> 03:27:27.000
and they show like you know

03:27:27.000 --> 03:27:29.000
what it looks like on screen

03:27:29.000 --> 03:27:31.000
this guy looks like a douche

03:27:31.000 --> 03:27:33.000
so I don't know if I want to play this game

03:27:33.000 --> 03:27:35.000
because I don't want to be that douchey guy

03:27:35.000 --> 03:27:37.000
I kind of am curious

03:27:37.000 --> 03:27:39.000
I'm curious just to see what it is

03:27:39.000 --> 03:27:41.000
I might play it once in a dark room

03:27:41.000 --> 03:27:43.000
when nobody can see me

03:27:43.000 --> 03:27:45.000
and then I was going to mention there's a game

03:27:45.000 --> 03:27:47.000
um called Minitroid

03:27:47.000 --> 03:27:49.000
that is I don't know if it's out yet

03:27:49.000 --> 03:27:51.000
or it's possibly being worked on

03:27:51.000 --> 03:27:53.000
but it's basically a

03:27:53.000 --> 03:27:55.000
remake or demake of

03:27:55.000 --> 03:27:57.000
Metroid 2 but it's a

03:27:57.000 --> 03:27:59.000
browser game and um

03:27:59.000 --> 03:28:01.000
it's really

03:28:01.000 --> 03:28:03.000
cute looking it's kind of small

03:28:03.000 --> 03:28:05.000
but uh

03:28:05.000 --> 03:28:07.000
I don't think it's been released

03:28:07.000 --> 03:28:09.000
yet but it is coming

03:28:09.000 --> 03:28:11.000
alright

03:28:11.000 --> 03:28:13.000
oh indiegames.com

03:28:13.000 --> 03:28:15.000
let's see here

03:28:15.000 --> 03:28:17.000
what's the links

03:28:17.000 --> 03:28:19.000
links to links

03:28:19.000 --> 03:28:21.000
um

03:28:21.000 --> 03:28:23.000
uh

03:28:23.000 --> 03:28:25.000
hate it

03:28:25.000 --> 03:28:27.000
when like I have to find something

03:28:27.000 --> 03:28:29.000
and it's like four links in

03:28:29.000 --> 03:28:31.000
it's really annoying

03:28:31.000 --> 03:28:33.000
well speaking of annoying

03:28:33.000 --> 03:28:35.000
um I also saw that apparently

03:28:35.000 --> 03:28:37.000

03:28:41.000 --> 03:28:43.000

03:28:45.000 --> 03:28:47.000
getting a use for the clubs

03:28:47.000 --> 03:28:49.000
just throwing that out there

03:28:49.000 --> 03:28:51.000
I have to bring that out every time home gets brought up

03:28:51.000 --> 03:28:53.000
I'm going to knock the clubs

03:28:53.000 --> 03:28:55.000
that's it that's all

03:28:55.000 --> 03:28:57.000
I have to talk about

03:28:57.000 --> 03:28:59.000
alright

03:28:59.000 --> 03:29:01.000
uh let's go ahead and start to

03:29:01.000 --> 03:29:03.000

hiatus or what have you

03:29:11.000 --> 03:29:13.000
you have no more last minute stories

03:29:13.000 --> 03:29:15.000
no I'm just dealing with some hate in the chat room

03:29:15.000 --> 03:29:17.000
I'm dealing with it

03:29:17.000 --> 03:29:19.000
no I know because I'm trying to do a show

03:29:19.000 --> 03:29:21.000
yeah Alan

03:29:21.000 --> 03:29:23.000

03:29:27.000 --> 03:29:29.000

03:29:29.000 --> 03:29:31.000
you can get it at Best Buy for $29.95

03:29:31.000 --> 03:29:33.000
it is not a

03:29:33.000 --> 03:29:35.000
upgrade so you can buy the new game

03:29:35.000 --> 03:29:37.000
as it is just for that price

03:29:37.000 --> 03:29:39.000
and it comes with a free month

03:29:39.000 --> 03:29:41.000
and it lets you do a character that you can

03:29:41.000 --> 03:29:43.000
switch sides and become a villain or a

03:29:43.000 --> 03:29:45.000
mercenary and there's a whole new world in there

03:29:45.000 --> 03:29:47.000

03:30:31.000 --> 03:30:33.000
in the California license plate now

03:30:33.000 --> 03:30:35.000

like making the stop sign it said stop

03:30:37.000 --> 03:30:39.000

we really appreciate it all we

03:31:25.000 --> 03:31:27.000
ask you guys we don't have any advertising just

03:31:27.000 --> 03:31:29.000
tell two people about our show

03:31:29.000 --> 03:31:31.000
