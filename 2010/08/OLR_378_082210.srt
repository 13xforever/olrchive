1
00:00:15,861 --> 00:00:25,308
[SPEAKER_01]: 2010, a new drawing tablet is announced for the Wii, Goldeneye is set to get Golden Wii accessories, and could a recent PC cult classic be coming to Xbox Live and PSN?

2
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:36,574
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello my friends on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:36,654 --> 00:00:42,580
[SPEAKER_04]: We are that show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

4
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,483
[SPEAKER_04]: We like to think of ourselves as the place where every gamer has a voice.

5
00:00:46,063 --> 00:00:46,964
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Rob Roberts.

6
00:00:46,984 --> 00:00:49,927
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my awesome co-host.

7
00:00:50,307 --> 00:00:53,230
[SPEAKER_04]: Say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

8
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,851
[SPEAKER_04]: Dan's 3 Bean Salad is amazing and you should have some.

9
00:01:19,821 --> 00:01:27,445
[SPEAKER_04]: I may have to a little later when I'm finished downing these yummy parmesan garlic and herb pita chips that I managed to eat the entire bag over the course of a week.

10
00:01:27,465 --> 00:01:29,766
[SPEAKER_10]: We should totally take a picture of you modeling them, Rob.

11
00:01:30,386 --> 00:01:31,467
[SPEAKER_10]: Perhaps I will in a moment.

12
00:01:31,527 --> 00:01:32,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe later.

13
00:01:32,067 --> 00:01:34,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Then the whole chat can see my Journey shirt.

14
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:36,892
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually just realized that my phone is in the bedroom and I'm too lazy to go get it.

15
00:01:50,296 --> 00:01:52,257
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not, I'm not, because I've had a change of heart.

16
00:01:52,277 --> 00:01:52,437
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm-hmm.

17
00:02:20,928 --> 00:02:24,189
[SPEAKER_04]: We can talk about that later, but I want to introduce because he's back.

18
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:24,910
[SPEAKER_04]: We've missed him.

19
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:27,971
[SPEAKER_04]: He's been gone for a few weeks, but he is back in the house tonight.

20
00:02:28,491 --> 00:02:29,751
[SPEAKER_04]: Say hello to Loki.

21
00:02:29,952 --> 00:02:30,352
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.

22
00:02:30,372 --> 00:02:31,152
[SPEAKER_04]: Techmaster Loki.

23
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:31,872
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you doing?

24
00:02:32,412 --> 00:02:32,993
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm fine.

25
00:02:33,193 --> 00:02:34,753
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell us about the baby.

26
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:35,534
[SPEAKER_04]: We all want to know.

27
00:02:35,634 --> 00:02:36,894
[SPEAKER_02]: He's not doing much.

28
00:02:37,634 --> 00:02:41,116
[SPEAKER_02]: He just pretty much sleeps and poops and eats and that's about it.

29
00:02:41,196 --> 00:02:46,458
[SPEAKER_02]: He's awake every now and then for a few hours, but we've been trying to get him to sleep a little bit better at night.

30
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:48,280
[SPEAKER_02]: He looks like it's kind of funny at night.

31
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:51,122
[SPEAKER_02]: He, I guess, doesn't sleep too deeply.

32
00:02:51,643 --> 00:02:55,507
[SPEAKER_02]: And it looks like he makes all these like kind of arm and leg movements.

33
00:02:55,527 --> 00:02:57,849
[SPEAKER_02]: So it looks like he's fighting somebody in his sleep.

34
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:58,790
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's kind of funny.

35
00:03:00,412 --> 00:03:01,553
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully it's not his father.

36
00:03:02,133 --> 00:03:05,737
[SPEAKER_02]: No, he's just like, and like kicking his legs up and stuff.

37
00:03:05,957 --> 00:03:06,358
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

38
00:03:06,798 --> 00:03:08,240
[SPEAKER_10]: Has he resisted the swaddling?

39
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,582
[SPEAKER_02]: He doesn't like to be swaddled, really.

40
00:03:10,905 --> 00:03:11,946
[SPEAKER_10]: Neither did Becky's son.

41
00:03:12,766 --> 00:03:15,869
[SPEAKER_10]: They always say that babies should be swaddled when they're really young.

42
00:03:16,569 --> 00:03:19,051
[SPEAKER_10]: I've seen more babies than not just completely hate it.

43
00:03:19,211 --> 00:03:21,133
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so weird that everybody has babies now.

44
00:03:21,473 --> 00:03:22,313
[SPEAKER_02]: He liked it at first.

45
00:03:22,394 --> 00:03:23,694
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just I think he gets hot.

46
00:03:23,795 --> 00:03:26,577
[SPEAKER_02]: He takes after me, so we run really warm.

47
00:03:27,757 --> 00:03:36,384
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not fun to have a tight blanket on you when you're really hot.

48
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:38,225
[SPEAKER_10]: There was one picture of him that I have to say.

49
00:03:38,265 --> 00:03:39,226
[SPEAKER_10]: He looked like a little monkey.

50
00:03:40,131 --> 00:03:41,072
[SPEAKER_02]: He does look like a little monkey.

51
00:03:41,092 --> 00:03:44,235
[SPEAKER_02]: He also looks like... Oh, what's his name?

52
00:03:47,058 --> 00:03:48,520
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the kids from Malcolm in the Middle.

53
00:03:51,324 --> 00:03:51,664
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

54
00:03:52,645 --> 00:03:52,945
[SPEAKER_02]: Dewey.

55
00:03:53,385 --> 00:03:55,087
[SPEAKER_02]: He looks like Dewey from Malcolm in the Mill.

56
00:03:55,747 --> 00:04:03,993
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com where our chatters can chat with us live as we do tape Sunday nights at All Games Radio.

57
00:04:04,633 --> 00:04:07,015
[SPEAKER_04]: www.allgames.com is where you can listen to our show live.

58
00:04:07,055 --> 00:04:11,758
[SPEAKER_04]: We do tape 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show at All Games Radio.

59
00:04:11,778 --> 00:04:17,863
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you want to chat live during the show, you've got to go to a different website, chat.orangeloungeradio.com and, you know, that's

60
00:04:18,603 --> 00:04:20,545
[SPEAKER_04]: That's our thing, where every gamer has a voice.

61
00:04:20,585 --> 00:04:29,252
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, yeah, we talk about news, but I'm sure most of you that go to the trouble to download gaming blogs, or download gaming podcasts, probably also read gaming blogs.

62
00:04:29,452 --> 00:04:33,815
[SPEAKER_04]: So I know you get your news from there, but we talk about it with you guys and get some different perspectives.

63
00:04:34,296 --> 00:04:36,578
[SPEAKER_04]: But tonight, it's a lot of questions about Loki.

64
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:39,240
[SPEAKER_04]: ToyGak says, holy shit, I missed you.

65
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,683
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if he's talking about the show in general or Loki or both or what, but there you go.

66
00:04:43,063 --> 00:04:44,585
[SPEAKER_04]: Spazinator says, you were gone.

67
00:04:45,886 --> 00:04:46,527
[SPEAKER_04]: LOL, JK.

68
00:04:47,968 --> 00:04:49,950
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Dark Knight says, where's our cigars?

69
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:50,550
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

70
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:52,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that a tradition people still do anymore?

71
00:04:52,993 --> 00:04:53,853
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't think... I don't know.

72
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:59,699
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought after all the whole, like, smoking kills stuff, you know, and they really frown on smoking in general.

73
00:04:59,739 --> 00:05:01,000
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't do the cigars so much anymore.

74
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:04,203
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen candy cigars, but not the real ones.

75
00:05:04,243 --> 00:05:05,124
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I don't know.

76
00:05:05,804 --> 00:05:10,567
[SPEAKER_04]: Bobby Blackwolf, the man who does the show before us here at All Games Radio, has a great question.

77
00:05:10,847 --> 00:05:12,448
[SPEAKER_04]: Does he appreciate the nursery?

78
00:05:12,648 --> 00:05:17,451
[SPEAKER_02]: He doesn't really use the nursery yet because he's still sleeping in our room in a little portable crib.

79
00:05:17,511 --> 00:05:19,192
[SPEAKER_02]: He will eventually use the nursery.

80
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:21,933
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not yet.

81
00:05:21,973 --> 00:05:23,594
[SPEAKER_02]: He does not appreciate the nursery yet.

82
00:05:23,654 --> 00:05:25,635
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think he can even see the nursery yet.

83
00:05:25,675 --> 00:05:33,339
[SPEAKER_02]: He really only can see about 8 to 12 inches in front of him because his eyes aren't fully developed yet.

84
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,260
[SPEAKER_10]: He can see red though.

85
00:05:35,714 --> 00:05:36,314
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

86
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:51,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like, goes crazy.

87
00:05:51,717 --> 00:05:54,699
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, I'm sure he will appreciate it later on.

88
00:05:54,739 --> 00:05:56,579
[SPEAKER_04]: He's just, he's a little young right now.

89
00:05:56,679 --> 00:06:00,041
[SPEAKER_04]: Were you here the week we talked about how your pictures got on a gaming blog?

90
00:06:00,061 --> 00:06:01,342
[SPEAKER_04]: Or was that the night Josh was born?

91
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:03,663
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that was the week that Josh was born.

92
00:06:03,723 --> 00:06:05,304
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, your pictures made it onto what?

93
00:06:05,364 --> 00:06:06,464
[SPEAKER_04]: Game Informer or something?

94
00:06:06,484 --> 00:06:07,685
[SPEAKER_04]: Some pretty big magazine.

95
00:06:08,185 --> 00:06:14,428
[SPEAKER_04]: And we were kind of like laughing because it had nothing to do with the fact that you're here on Orange Launch Radio, which, you know, it's fine.

96
00:06:14,468 --> 00:06:17,670
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody listens to the show except the few faithful folks we've had over the years.

97
00:06:18,651 --> 00:06:23,435
[SPEAKER_04]: But you just cracked me up because they found your photos on Flickr and thought it made for a good story.

98
00:06:23,676 --> 00:06:32,384
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think that just goes to show, yeah, sure, a lot of people may have thought of doing a Mario-themed nursery for their babies, but Matt took the full...

99
00:06:33,325 --> 00:06:34,045
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

100
00:06:50,051 --> 00:06:53,994
[SPEAKER_04]: He'll never realize what cool parents he has doing his room in the video game theme.

101
00:06:54,575 --> 00:07:05,323
[SPEAKER_04]: Because by the time he's a teenager, well, obviously the room will be changed by the time he's a teenager, but by the time he's like, you know, it's time for that nursery theme to be changed, he'll probably be like, man, video games are lame.

102
00:07:05,804 --> 00:07:08,346
[SPEAKER_04]: All my dad does is talk about video games.

103
00:07:09,807 --> 00:07:11,829
[SPEAKER_04]: No, he won't do that.

104
00:07:13,999 --> 00:07:14,580
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just messing.

105
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:21,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, look, I... Maybe spoil, because you're like, oh, and they're like, oh man, I really wish I had like a Wii 2 or something.

106
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:23,033
[SPEAKER_02]: Be like, ah, I already got that.

107
00:07:23,534 --> 00:07:25,036
[SPEAKER_02]: I bought that for myself.

108
00:07:25,196 --> 00:07:26,719
[SPEAKER_02]: But hey, you can use it if you want, you know.

109
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:28,882
[SPEAKER_04]: He'll never get to play them because his dad will always be using it.

110
00:07:29,144 --> 00:07:29,685
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

111
00:07:47,246 --> 00:07:48,788
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, what a weekend I've had.

112
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:49,669
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm hanging in there.

113
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:52,793
[SPEAKER_14]: Tell us about it, because your weekend and my weekend were very similar.

114
00:07:52,833 --> 00:08:00,762
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, we had a road trip up to Reno because the Rocky Horror Troupe that Rob is a part of was doing a Rocky Horror performance for about...

115
00:08:02,844 --> 00:08:03,504
[SPEAKER_14]: 3,500 people, we think?

116
00:08:04,044 --> 00:08:05,405
[SPEAKER_04]: The number is still debated.

117
00:08:05,605 --> 00:08:07,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I've heard everywhere from 2,000 to 6,800.

118
00:08:07,546 --> 00:08:11,228
[SPEAKER_04]: And they do it in an arena.

119
00:08:11,468 --> 00:08:14,370
[SPEAKER_04]: It's definitely the largest showing they do regularly in the country.

120
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:17,032
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there was once a large, large, large show in LA.

121
00:08:17,392 --> 00:08:20,794
[SPEAKER_04]: But, I mean, this is the largest regular show they do where it's literally thousands of people.

122
00:08:20,854 --> 00:08:25,997
[SPEAKER_04]: And honestly, at that point, 2,500, 6,800 looks all the same to me.

123
00:08:26,057 --> 00:08:28,238
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a shit ton of people all to be in one place.

124
00:08:28,638 --> 00:08:29,399
[SPEAKER_04]: That earns the Saturn bone.

125
00:08:45,185 --> 00:08:54,072
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, and I was worried that you were going to get that whole associated response thing with Reno, so that next time I said, hey, let's go to Reno, you'd just think about barfing, and you'd be like, no, I don't want to go.

126
00:08:54,232 --> 00:09:05,421
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, and I started to feel kind of fluish and crappy during the car ride up, and I'm like, all right, three-hour car ride, change in elevation, I just feel kind of icky, hit the buffet, and now my stomach was like, that was a bad plan.

127
00:09:05,441 --> 00:09:06,702
[SPEAKER_04]: That was your first mistake.

128
00:09:07,102 --> 00:09:07,343
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

129
00:09:07,503 --> 00:09:11,286
[SPEAKER_02]: You didn't condition yourself with enough junk food beforehand, see.

130
00:09:12,086 --> 00:09:17,630
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't go to really anywhere in Nevada and not have a buffet at some point.

131
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:18,430
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless you live there.

132
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:20,631
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure we have plenty of listeners in Las Vegas.

133
00:09:20,651 --> 00:09:21,372
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, I know we do.

134
00:09:21,712 --> 00:09:25,975
[SPEAKER_04]: That are probably listening to this going, I'm sick of fucking hearing about buffets.

135
00:09:26,635 --> 00:09:27,375
[SPEAKER_02]: They suck.

136
00:09:27,395 --> 00:09:27,896
[SPEAKER_02]: They're terrible.

137
00:09:28,456 --> 00:09:33,562
[SPEAKER_02]: They can shut up because they have Krispy Kreme, and Krispy Kreme is awesome, and I wish we still had it here.

138
00:09:33,623 --> 00:09:34,744
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead, it's going to be what?

139
00:09:35,305 --> 00:09:36,506
[SPEAKER_02]: What were they turning into?

140
00:09:36,526 --> 00:09:38,068
[SPEAKER_02]: A Chick-fil-A?

141
00:09:38,709 --> 00:09:40,231
[SPEAKER_02]: A Panera Bread.

142
00:09:41,853 --> 00:09:42,774
[SPEAKER_02]: Panera, screw it.

143
00:09:42,994 --> 00:09:45,898
[SPEAKER_02]: Put it back to being a Krispy Kreme again.

144
00:09:46,178 --> 00:09:47,619
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't care less about Panera.

145
00:09:47,659 --> 00:09:50,180
[SPEAKER_04]: That building's been empty for like three years.

146
00:09:50,281 --> 00:09:52,002
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's been a very long time.

147
00:09:52,082 --> 00:09:53,422
[SPEAKER_04]: It's longer than three years.

148
00:09:53,542 --> 00:09:54,363
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been very long.

149
00:09:54,423 --> 00:09:57,005
[SPEAKER_04]: Finally, they're putting a Panera bread in there, which I like Panera bread.

150
00:09:57,025 --> 00:09:57,745
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they're really good.

151
00:09:58,045 --> 00:09:58,986
[SPEAKER_04]: Good, healthy place to eat.

152
00:10:00,447 --> 00:10:02,668
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like them because they're egg sandwiches.

153
00:10:03,028 --> 00:10:04,629
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't scramble their eggs.

154
00:10:04,709 --> 00:10:07,331
[SPEAKER_02]: They just kind of fry it and then you get like chunks of...

155
00:10:07,811 --> 00:10:09,552
[SPEAKER_10]: If it's egg salad, it shouldn't be.

156
00:10:10,152 --> 00:10:12,173
[SPEAKER_10]: Or did you just say egg or egg salad?

157
00:10:12,313 --> 00:10:14,914
[SPEAKER_04]: No, like they're breakfast sandwiches with eggs on them.

158
00:10:15,434 --> 00:10:18,795
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, once in a while, we do stop talking about food and start talking about video games.

159
00:10:18,815 --> 00:10:20,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Just want you to know, it's not a Food Network podcast.

160
00:10:21,136 --> 00:10:21,796
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a game podcast.

161
00:10:21,836 --> 00:10:26,858
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, it's very, if they had scrambled their eggs, it'd be an even distribution between the yolk and the white.

162
00:10:26,878 --> 00:10:31,940
[SPEAKER_02]: And the problem is, when you fry it like that, you get these big chunks of yolk and it doesn't taste very good.

163
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,701
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus, they don't season anything and it's terrible.

164
00:10:36,061 --> 00:10:37,442
[SPEAKER_02]: Really wish it was a Krispy Kreme again.

165
00:10:39,132 --> 00:10:47,020
[SPEAKER_04]: Next time, if you really want, Loki, one of these nights, when I come back from the Bay Area, I'll have to do it when Jamie's not looking, because she'll be mad, but I'll sneak you some Krispy Kremes.

166
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,181
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

167
00:10:49,101 --> 00:10:50,583
[SPEAKER_04]: From the Bay Area, because they still have them there.

168
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:51,143
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what?

169
00:10:51,644 --> 00:10:54,166
[SPEAKER_10]: I want one Krispy Kreme in particular.

170
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:55,087
[SPEAKER_04]: Which one?

171
00:10:55,207 --> 00:10:56,008
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the...

172
00:10:59,787 --> 00:11:03,770
[SPEAKER_10]: As much as I like them, my favorite to this day is still the Eclair.

173
00:11:04,551 --> 00:11:05,832
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I do love the custard.

174
00:11:06,152 --> 00:11:08,554
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I might have to think about doing that.

175
00:11:08,654 --> 00:11:09,955
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there one on the way home for me?

176
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:10,716
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there is.

177
00:11:10,876 --> 00:11:12,177
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think I have to go too far.

178
00:11:12,257 --> 00:11:14,539
[SPEAKER_08]: You should just take me to the Bay Area.

179
00:11:14,619 --> 00:11:16,321
[SPEAKER_04]: You should just take you?

180
00:11:16,701 --> 00:11:17,361
[SPEAKER_08]: Just take me there.

181
00:11:17,381 --> 00:11:18,642
[SPEAKER_04]: There's one near me in Daly City.

182
00:11:18,763 --> 00:11:21,265
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know where you would stay for the night.

183
00:11:21,285 --> 00:11:22,886
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you can't sleep in the bed.

184
00:11:22,906 --> 00:11:23,747
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll walk the streets.

185
00:11:23,827 --> 00:11:24,087
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

186
00:11:25,248 --> 00:11:25,508
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

187
00:11:26,109 --> 00:11:27,770
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to lonely roam the streets?

188
00:11:29,029 --> 00:11:31,811
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll be driving around singing Journey songs.

189
00:11:32,472 --> 00:11:35,594
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft in our chatroom says, it isn't OLR without Orange Lounge Foodio.

190
00:11:35,634 --> 00:11:36,214
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't you know it?

191
00:11:37,095 --> 00:11:39,817
[SPEAKER_04]: Monty Boggs says, I click off once they stop talking about food.

192
00:11:41,298 --> 00:11:43,940
[SPEAKER_04]: Jim Sally says, Krispy Kreme buffet would be heaven.

193
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:45,505
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

194
00:12:02,379 --> 00:12:02,960
[SPEAKER_02]: It's dumb.

195
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,683
[SPEAKER_02]: It's because they figured out that website, you know, this is whyyou'refat.com or something like that.

196
00:12:08,023 --> 00:12:10,045
[SPEAKER_02]: And people are like, oh, look, that's really bad for you.

197
00:12:10,065 --> 00:12:11,586
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's make a burger out of it or something.

198
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:17,230
[SPEAKER_02]: And we get publication, you know, because people talk about it and how crazy it is and stuff like that.

199
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:18,370
[SPEAKER_02]: It's ridiculous.

200
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:20,152
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a trend that I wish would go away.

201
00:12:20,752 --> 00:12:27,597
[SPEAKER_14]: There was an episode of the Boondocks on Cartoon Network specifically about the grandpa opening up a soul food restaurant with the Luther.

202
00:12:28,738 --> 00:12:29,098
[SPEAKER_14]: Wow.

203
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:30,039
[SPEAKER_14]: Huh.

204
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:31,800
Ah.

205
00:12:32,145 --> 00:12:32,566
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

206
00:12:49,162 --> 00:12:51,663
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I tried to get Rob to order one.

207
00:12:51,683 --> 00:12:52,703
[SPEAKER_04]: He was like, no.

208
00:12:52,843 --> 00:12:57,605
[SPEAKER_04]: Even when he described it, I was like, oh, it was a deep fried ham and cheese sandwich?

209
00:12:57,625 --> 00:13:07,008
[SPEAKER_14]: It's thick sourdough toast with ham and Swiss, and then it's dipped in sort of a sweet batter, deep fried, and then served with strawberry jam and powdered sugar.

210
00:13:08,529 --> 00:13:10,791
[SPEAKER_10]: It's ham and cheese French toast with crap on it.

211
00:13:10,911 --> 00:13:12,753
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, see, there's a lot of things I don't like about that.

212
00:13:12,773 --> 00:13:16,056
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like crap on my French toast other than, you know, maybe powdered sugar.

213
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:18,298
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really don't like powdered sugar if I can get it without it.

214
00:13:19,719 --> 00:13:22,142
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really care for jams and jellies and stuff like that.

215
00:13:22,362 --> 00:13:24,844
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, I hate Swiss.

216
00:13:26,265 --> 00:13:27,306
[SPEAKER_02]: He's quite a picky eater.

217
00:13:27,386 --> 00:13:28,187
[SPEAKER_02]: I am a picky eater.

218
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:29,909
[SPEAKER_04]: Swiss is one of the lowest sodium cheeses.

219
00:13:30,229 --> 00:13:33,432
[SPEAKER_04]: And just also random, you know where I saw that on the menu?

220
00:13:33,852 --> 00:13:34,412
[SPEAKER_04]: Bennegan's.

221
00:13:34,773 --> 00:13:35,993
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, there are still Bennegan's.

222
00:13:36,894 --> 00:13:40,656
[SPEAKER_02]: What they need to do is they need to take a burger, bread it in the pub.

223
00:13:40,776 --> 00:13:41,416
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what it's called?

224
00:13:41,596 --> 00:13:43,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Crumbled bacon and then fry that.

225
00:13:44,938 --> 00:13:45,478
[SPEAKER_10]: I've seen it.

226
00:13:46,478 --> 00:13:47,659
[SPEAKER_10]: I've never been there.

227
00:13:48,579 --> 00:13:49,960
[SPEAKER_10]: Didn't we go at California Extreme?

228
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:50,841
[SPEAKER_10]: No, we went to IHOP.

229
00:13:53,206 --> 00:13:53,807
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura.com

230
00:14:11,152 --> 00:14:17,674
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, this, I found, the company that I work at that I'm about to get laid off of, I found my boss's Facebook page.

231
00:14:18,615 --> 00:14:20,075
[SPEAKER_10]: My first boss, who hired me.

232
00:14:20,595 --> 00:14:24,076
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm looking at his photos of him with... And he was Carol Channing?

233
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:27,397
[SPEAKER_02]: You were hired by Carol Channing?

234
00:14:27,417 --> 00:14:28,698
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you like raspberries?

235
00:14:29,318 --> 00:14:30,479
[SPEAKER_10]: It's... It's... Hired!

236
00:14:30,979 --> 00:14:33,521
[SPEAKER_10]: But he's the world's biggest Anne Margaret fan.

237
00:14:34,182 --> 00:14:37,364
[SPEAKER_10]: And he also has met lots of... He's gone to her house.

238
00:14:38,385 --> 00:14:38,525
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

239
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:40,166
[SPEAKER_10]: Got tons of photos, you know.

240
00:14:40,747 --> 00:14:48,553
[SPEAKER_10]: He and his partner have, you know, met, you know, her and her husband and gone to shows and sat in box seats.

241
00:14:49,193 --> 00:14:52,056
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'm also looking at his other photos of other celebrities that he's met.

242
00:14:52,116 --> 00:14:54,718
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's, like, him and Carol Channing and Bo Derek.

243
00:14:54,858 --> 00:14:55,598
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's pretty cool.

244
00:14:55,698 --> 00:14:58,841
[SPEAKER_04]: He's gonna be really sad in about ten years when all his favorite celebrities die.

245
00:15:00,468 --> 00:15:02,980
[SPEAKER_02]: Wish I had pictures with all the celebrities I've met.

246
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,000
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura.com

247
00:15:31,798 --> 00:15:32,779
[SPEAKER_04]: How was your gaming week?

248
00:15:33,339 --> 00:15:34,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Or two weeks, if you wish.

249
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,961
[SPEAKER_10]: I really didn't play much of anything.

250
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:37,342
[SPEAKER_10]: I played a little pinball.

251
00:15:38,082 --> 00:15:42,025
[SPEAKER_10]: And mostly I watched Dan scream at his Nintendo emulator.

252
00:15:43,045 --> 00:15:46,347
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, today I watched him yell at Rad Bracer.

253
00:15:47,448 --> 00:15:49,189
[SPEAKER_10]: But I wanted to hear the music in it.

254
00:15:49,209 --> 00:15:51,391
[SPEAKER_10]: The do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.

255
00:15:51,411 --> 00:15:56,074
[SPEAKER_10]: The one that was used in the Strong Bad anime one.

256
00:15:56,955 --> 00:16:01,580
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, and then Dan played some Turbo Outrun and Outrunners.

257
00:16:02,721 --> 00:16:04,563
[SPEAKER_10]: It was old school racing to hear it.

258
00:16:04,943 --> 00:16:05,744
[SPEAKER_10]: Fuck it and turn it off.

259
00:16:06,965 --> 00:16:12,912
[SPEAKER_10]: And I found my Ninja Pass, but I couldn't find my micro SD card.

260
00:16:13,152 --> 00:16:15,775
[SPEAKER_04]: I think those are pretty cheap to come by.

261
00:16:16,181 --> 00:16:18,282
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I ordered one for five bucks.

262
00:16:18,922 --> 00:16:27,584
[SPEAKER_10]: But the whole reason I wanted it is because since I'm going back to the gym, my favorite thing to do is to go, well, back in the day it was go on the elliptical and play Pokemans.

263
00:16:28,525 --> 00:16:34,126
[SPEAKER_10]: So now it's going to be, I guess, play whatever game I happen to have on me.

264
00:16:34,406 --> 00:16:40,608
[SPEAKER_10]: And I wanted to find some of those SNES ROM conversions for the DSi.

265
00:16:40,928 --> 00:16:41,168
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

266
00:16:41,989 --> 00:16:44,812
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I can play lots and lots of Seiken 3.

267
00:16:44,852 --> 00:16:48,375
[SPEAKER_10]: Because that's been the game I've really been wanting to get into playing.

268
00:16:48,395 --> 00:16:50,237
[SPEAKER_04]: Or just Final Fantasy 6, 3, whatever you want to call it.

269
00:16:50,257 --> 00:16:52,799
[SPEAKER_10]: But I have a new game that I'm going to be playing.

270
00:16:52,999 --> 00:16:53,260
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?

271
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:56,002
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you to a lack of forgetfulness.

272
00:16:56,322 --> 00:16:59,065
[SPEAKER_04]: Finally, after like a month, I finally remember to bring Dark Sakura.

273
00:16:59,465 --> 00:17:00,626
[SPEAKER_10]: Final Fantasy 13.

274
00:17:00,706 --> 00:17:02,108
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I really should finish that game.

275
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:03,549
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll be playing the crap out of this.

276
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:05,411
[SPEAKER_10]: And I start school next week, too.

277
00:17:06,055 --> 00:17:06,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Good times.

278
00:17:06,655 --> 00:17:07,335
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to be busy.

279
00:17:07,435 --> 00:17:11,257
[SPEAKER_10]: And Tuesday is old school DDR night at our Vigil.

280
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:11,877
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

281
00:17:12,357 --> 00:17:14,438
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go.

282
00:17:14,858 --> 00:17:19,419
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if I'll actually play Ditter, but I'll definitely play some 2DX.

283
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:23,620
[SPEAKER_04]: And if they ever fix their freaking Technica machine, I'll play that too.

284
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,721
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to play DDR.

285
00:17:25,161 --> 00:17:25,401
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

286
00:17:28,775 --> 00:17:30,256
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I'll play one round of DDR.

287
00:17:30,996 --> 00:17:31,796
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be fun.

288
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:34,958
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't done that in forever, but I'm almost afraid to try again.

289
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:40,180
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because last night... It's because I still think... It's humbling.

290
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,942
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to have to go down to five footers to get yourself back into it.

291
00:17:44,002 --> 00:17:47,663
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been playing sixes and sevens, and it's been fine for me.

292
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,651
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

293
00:18:32,614 --> 00:18:33,375
[SPEAKER_10]: DanSansRevolution Preview Party

294
00:18:50,011 --> 00:18:50,672
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft

295
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:16,631
[SPEAKER_04]: Dvrx said Dave and Buster's in town.

296
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,721
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to laugh.

297
00:19:38,341 --> 00:19:45,446
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm sorry to interrupt because you mentioned Mel B. I had to laugh because I've been seeing this on my release list and I finally found the box art for it.

298
00:19:45,466 --> 00:19:49,088
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a game coming out in the week called Get Fit with Mel B.

299
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:55,478
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm the runner up on Dancing with the Stars, but some asshole on the internet doesn't know who I am.

300
00:20:10,598 --> 00:20:13,440
[SPEAKER_10]: At any rate, Dan and I are having our fifth wedding anniversary.

301
00:20:13,841 --> 00:20:14,761
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh.

302
00:20:15,142 --> 00:20:24,189
[SPEAKER_10]: And we were going to get folks together on the day before because we can't do the $40 free play thing all day thing on our actual anniversary.

303
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:30,754
[SPEAKER_10]: So we were going to go and hit up Dave and Buster's and have like a big party with whoever wants to show up.

304
00:20:31,455 --> 00:20:31,955
[SPEAKER_03]: What day is this?

305
00:20:32,255 --> 00:20:32,515
[SPEAKER_10]: The 31st.

306
00:20:32,816 --> 00:20:33,196
[SPEAKER_04]: August 31st.

307
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:39,641
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

308
00:20:57,470 --> 00:21:01,991
[SPEAKER_04]: and then you are officially one of the chosen people at that point, right?

309
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:03,652
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I'm officially one of the chosen people.

310
00:21:03,852 --> 00:21:05,112
[SPEAKER_04]: Congrats in advance.

311
00:21:05,552 --> 00:21:05,832
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

312
00:21:06,512 --> 00:21:09,873
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, somehow we completely deviated from the talk of video games.

313
00:21:10,954 --> 00:21:11,874
[SPEAKER_04]: What did we hit on in there?

314
00:21:12,514 --> 00:21:14,295
[SPEAKER_04]: Jews, Spice Girls?

315
00:21:15,275 --> 00:21:15,715
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but anyway.

316
00:21:16,355 --> 00:21:17,335
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, Loki!

317
00:21:18,276 --> 00:21:19,596
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't been playing a whole lot.

318
00:21:20,197 --> 00:21:21,297
[SPEAKER_02]: You got a good excuse.

319
00:21:21,957 --> 00:21:25,199
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to think back to what I played at the hospital on the DS.

320
00:21:25,219 --> 00:21:28,160
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know if I played anything on the DS.

321
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:33,842
[SPEAKER_02]: I played a little bit more of Spirit Tracks.

322
00:21:34,562 --> 00:21:36,283
[SPEAKER_02]: That game's okay.

323
00:21:36,983 --> 00:21:40,805
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the Zelda games on the DS, I just don't go through them very quickly, but...

324
00:21:41,585 --> 00:21:42,726
[SPEAKER_02]: It's alright.

325
00:21:43,707 --> 00:21:51,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Then mainly the only thing I've been playing since I got back to work has been the Grand Theft Auto Lost and Damned.

326
00:21:51,354 --> 00:22:02,503
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we've gone back to Lost and Damned now because they were kind of craving the open world Grand Theft Auto deathmatch things and since you can't really do that in the Battle of the Gate Tony...

327
00:22:03,604 --> 00:22:04,665
[SPEAKER_02]: We're playing Lost in Damage.

328
00:22:04,685 --> 00:22:05,965
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually a little bit more fun.

329
00:22:06,006 --> 00:22:11,229
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little less serious because I'm not really trying to get up on the leaderboards for that.

330
00:22:12,329 --> 00:22:17,933
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of want to go back to the Battle of Gay Tony so I can actually get to the top of the leaderboards because I kind of stopped at rank 59.

331
00:22:21,895 --> 00:22:39,458
[SPEAKER_02]: But then on top of all that, I've been working still on working on my mods and stuff for Grand Theft Auto because I have a really big one in the works right now that's going to be completely stuff that's never been done before on the console version.

332
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:54,471
[SPEAKER_02]: and thankfully I upgraded my computer to Windows 7 64-bit and added another 4 gigs of RAM so now it runs smoothly and I can actually run Grand Theft Auto without having it crash after 5 minutes.

333
00:22:55,071 --> 00:23:02,858
[SPEAKER_02]: There was something weird with the installation or something on XP so now it's really stable which is great and I can actually work on it.

334
00:23:03,318 --> 00:23:04,760
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of baby jokes in the chat room.

335
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:07,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Spazinator wants to know if you've been playing Babymaker Extreme.

336
00:23:08,443 --> 00:23:08,603
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope.

337
00:23:08,963 --> 00:23:12,467
[SPEAKER_04]: Frisbee says, Loki has been playing lots of Imagine Babies.

338
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:15,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, no.

339
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:18,935
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, uh... Just been playing reality babies.

340
00:23:18,955 --> 00:23:21,198
[SPEAKER_02]: Just been playing washing the bottles.

341
00:23:22,399 --> 00:23:24,021
[SPEAKER_02]: Changing the diapers.

342
00:23:24,061 --> 00:23:24,782
[SPEAKER_02]: Good times.

343
00:23:25,122 --> 00:23:25,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Fun stuff like that.

344
00:23:25,943 --> 00:23:27,585
[SPEAKER_02]: No, really, it's because now...

345
00:23:29,307 --> 00:23:32,209
[SPEAKER_02]: with the sleep schedule and everything, and we have to get up a lot of times.

346
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:38,013
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I kind of have to stick to the old person schedule where, you know, I have to go to bed at 9 o'clock at night.

347
00:23:38,033 --> 00:23:38,773
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

348
00:23:39,154 --> 00:23:40,995
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's been 11, okay?

349
00:23:41,775 --> 00:23:43,557
[SPEAKER_02]: 11 o'clock at night is really what we've been sticking to.

350
00:23:44,157 --> 00:23:52,603
[SPEAKER_02]: But sometimes 9 o'clock at night or 10, between 9 and 11, because I have to get up in the morning, like at 5 in the morning, you know, with the babies.

351
00:23:52,683 --> 00:23:52,903
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

352
00:23:54,844 --> 00:23:55,344
[SPEAKER_02]: Outro Outro Outro Outro

353
00:24:24,167 --> 00:24:28,194
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think anyone's surprised that you haven't been able to play a whole lot lately.

354
00:24:28,214 --> 00:24:31,440
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get into things I shouldn't be playing a little bit later.

355
00:24:34,761 --> 00:24:38,182
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, just lots of stuff to be doing.

356
00:24:38,242 --> 00:24:42,063
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've been mainly just working on the Grand Theft Auto stuff because that's what I play at work.

357
00:24:42,223 --> 00:24:46,184
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's going to be so fun once we get all the mod things done.

358
00:24:47,644 --> 00:24:50,125
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, you missed something you want to talk about in your week?

359
00:24:50,445 --> 00:24:51,625
[SPEAKER_04]: I played Star Trek Online.

360
00:24:51,805 --> 00:24:52,745
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, you always do.

361
00:24:52,785 --> 00:24:53,806
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything exciting going on there?

362
00:24:53,846 --> 00:24:54,446
[SPEAKER_10]: Dabo!

363
00:24:54,866 --> 00:24:55,706
[SPEAKER_10]: The implemented Dabo.

364
00:24:55,826 --> 00:24:57,567
[SPEAKER_10]: So you can gamble for Latinum.

365
00:24:59,267 --> 00:25:02,208
[SPEAKER_10]: And they have HoloLita and they got Chase Masterton to do her voice.

366
00:25:02,528 --> 00:25:02,728
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

367
00:25:02,908 --> 00:25:03,028
[SPEAKER_10]: So...

368
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:24,869
[SPEAKER_14]: I played the Castlevania Harmony of Schadenfreude or whatever the 360 version is No, I'm joking about the name The multiplayer one I played the demo of that Didn't like it Don't know why

369
00:25:26,104 --> 00:25:30,968
[SPEAKER_14]: Playing as Alucard, upscaled HD graphics, Castlevania, gave it two rounds.

370
00:25:31,888 --> 00:25:32,509
[SPEAKER_14]: It's weird.

371
00:25:32,549 --> 00:25:33,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Wasn't feeling it.

372
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:34,170
[SPEAKER_04]: It's weird.

373
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:36,472
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't feel like other Castlevania games.

374
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:41,916
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think, I hear that that game really shines on its best when it's multiplayer, which, you know, no big surprise there.

375
00:25:41,936 --> 00:25:43,437
[SPEAKER_04]: Most games are better when it's multiplayer.

376
00:25:43,497 --> 00:25:47,240
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, playing it normal is really strange.

377
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:53,665
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the whole, especially the way the whole map's zoomed out in the beginning is just kind of a weird, weird feeling.

378
00:25:53,685 --> 00:25:53,825
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

379
00:25:54,622 --> 00:25:55,722
[SPEAKER_14]: and some Puzzle Quest 2.

380
00:25:55,822 --> 00:25:56,642
[SPEAKER_14]: Still working on that.

381
00:25:58,423 --> 00:26:06,424
[SPEAKER_14]: Can only play that for maybe 30-45 minutes at a time because when you get to the lower levels, I'm almost at the max level.

382
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:07,844
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm level 43 out of 50.

383
00:26:08,664 --> 00:26:11,445
[SPEAKER_14]: You have to play so much freaking Bejeweled just to clear a room.

384
00:26:11,585 --> 00:26:12,705
[SPEAKER_14]: It kind of becomes a grind.

385
00:26:13,645 --> 00:26:15,246
[SPEAKER_14]: And of course, World of Warcraft.

386
00:26:15,926 --> 00:26:17,986
[SPEAKER_14]: Got some accomplishments done in that.

387
00:26:18,626 --> 00:26:20,927
[SPEAKER_04]: What are your biggest accomplishments in World of Warcraft so far?

388
00:26:20,947 --> 00:26:22,347
[SPEAKER_14]: 50 mounts.

389
00:26:25,363 --> 00:26:34,813
[SPEAKER_14]: and I finally grinded all five cities in Argent Tournament so I got my super hella exalted Argent champion with cheesecake achievement.

390
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:38,057
[SPEAKER_04]: Did Blizzard actually mail you a cheesecake?

391
00:26:38,197 --> 00:26:38,698
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope so.

392
00:26:39,238 --> 00:26:41,381
[SPEAKER_14]: Because all those dailies, never again.

393
00:26:41,501 --> 00:26:42,241
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to die.

394
00:26:42,261 --> 00:26:42,382
[SPEAKER_04]: Man!

395
00:26:43,703 --> 00:26:44,524
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

396
00:27:02,194 --> 00:27:21,902
[SPEAKER_04]: that would be a great idea for an MMO but you know there'd be people that would exploit the hell out of that so they'd have to think of funny ways to put caps on it but it's kind of like one of those loyalty programs like what Square Enix sends out what like iPhones or no iPod Touches or whatever if you're like a uber platinum bought every game we ever put out member or whatever but yeah anyhow

397
00:27:22,162 --> 00:27:26,345
[SPEAKER_14]: And our guild is now 6-12 of ICC.

398
00:27:26,525 --> 00:27:26,685
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

399
00:27:26,986 --> 00:27:28,126
[SPEAKER_14]: Same guild I'm in, of course.

400
00:27:28,247 --> 00:27:32,450
[SPEAKER_14]: We got down Rotface and... Festergut.

401
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:32,990
[SPEAKER_14]: Festergut.

402
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:36,693
[SPEAKER_14]: And we're working on Valthyria, Dreamwalker, Healy, Dragon.

403
00:27:36,733 --> 00:27:38,474
[SPEAKER_14]: Which probably was not the best idea for the next boss fight.

404
00:27:38,494 --> 00:27:39,555
[SPEAKER_14]: Which I don't like that fight at all.

405
00:27:39,695 --> 00:27:39,995
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah.

406
00:27:40,015 --> 00:27:40,936
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I don't know.

407
00:27:40,956 --> 00:27:43,938
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going back in tomorrow, so maybe we'll do the Blood Princes.

408
00:27:44,278 --> 00:27:44,799
[SPEAKER_04]: Was that what it is?

409
00:27:44,819 --> 00:27:45,439
[SPEAKER_04]: The Blood Queen?

410
00:27:45,459 --> 00:27:45,799
[SPEAKER_04]: The Princes?

411
00:27:45,819 --> 00:27:46,420
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever they're called?

412
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,841
[SPEAKER_14]: Princes and then Queen is after them.

413
00:27:47,881 --> 00:27:48,781
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, we gotta do that whole thing.

414
00:27:49,002 --> 00:27:49,202
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

415
00:27:49,842 --> 00:27:50,423
[SPEAKER_14]: Wow, wow, wow.

416
00:27:51,125 --> 00:27:52,407
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been playing a lot of WoW too, of course.

417
00:27:52,988 --> 00:27:54,330
[SPEAKER_04]: All the same things he's been talking about.

418
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:57,396
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, actually, no, because my accomplishments, I don't have nearly the same stuff.

419
00:27:57,456 --> 00:27:59,439
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't done the Uber stuff.

420
00:27:59,500 --> 00:27:59,720
[SPEAKER_04]: I have...

421
00:28:01,508 --> 00:28:24,479
[SPEAKER_04]: Alan's really good at focusing on one character, and I've got, I've started to develop, you know, as the wait continues on for Cataclysm, Altaholism, and, you know, I've been leveling a Shaman, which has been fun, and I've been slowly working on my Warrior, who has lulled at, like, 76 for the past, like, four months, she's up to, like, 78 now, so I'll probably get her over the hill to 80 at some point, then I'll have another 80, woo!

422
00:28:26,481 --> 00:28:29,683
[SPEAKER_04]: Outside of that though, another Blizzard game I've been playing a lot of.

423
00:28:29,943 --> 00:28:35,766
[SPEAKER_04]: I finally played StarCraft 2, which is old news to a lot of you guys.

424
00:28:36,006 --> 00:28:40,649
[SPEAKER_04]: Those of you that are huge fans of StarCraft bought this game the day it came out, I'm sure.

425
00:28:41,009 --> 00:28:44,631
[SPEAKER_04]: But you might remember I was very apprehensive about getting into StarCraft because...

426
00:28:45,091 --> 00:28:45,932
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

427
00:29:07,515 --> 00:29:08,396
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

428
00:29:23,797 --> 00:29:25,058
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

429
00:29:42,911 --> 00:29:46,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Multiplayer, not so noob friendly.

430
00:29:46,835 --> 00:29:48,837
[SPEAKER_04]: They've done some things.

431
00:29:48,857 --> 00:29:51,460
[SPEAKER_04]: There's this whole practice league you can do for a little while.

432
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,381
[SPEAKER_04]: You can slow down the game a lot.

433
00:29:53,622 --> 00:29:56,625
[SPEAKER_04]: There are some things they've done to help it be a little bit easier.

434
00:29:57,486 --> 00:30:00,829
[SPEAKER_04]: At the end of the day, when you try to play a human opponent, it's tough.

435
00:30:01,449 --> 00:30:28,610
[SPEAKER_04]: and uh playing though against like the computer AI depending on how you do it is is is cool um like you know a friend of mine from the WoW Guild and I were playing online the other night and we were playing two versus two but we would slow down the game and we played very easy computer and it was almost too easy like we whooped it like three times so we said let's step it up to easy and still we were able to conquer it you know a little more difficult but not not too bad so but then we played

436
00:30:29,471 --> 00:30:30,671
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

437
00:30:54,276 --> 00:30:56,017
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know the speed thing will come with time.

438
00:30:57,337 --> 00:30:59,218
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so multiplayer's been a very interesting experience.

439
00:30:59,238 --> 00:31:00,958
[SPEAKER_04]: But campaign's really cool.

440
00:31:01,058 --> 00:31:07,801
[SPEAKER_04]: Very animated, very cool little decks that you go through on the ship to kind of... Well, you don't start there.

441
00:31:07,841 --> 00:31:09,461
[SPEAKER_04]: You actually start in a different area.

442
00:31:09,481 --> 00:31:13,963
[SPEAKER_04]: But you move on to the ship, and you can kind of buy enhancements and things, which are really cool.

443
00:31:14,863 --> 00:31:16,004
[SPEAKER_04]: So I like what they did there.

444
00:31:16,604 --> 00:31:19,505
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's where things get weird, I think, with StarCraft, is that...

445
00:31:20,325 --> 00:31:21,186
[SPEAKER_04]: StarCraft Games StarCraft Games

446
00:31:46,621 --> 00:31:52,126
[SPEAKER_04]: But my question is, in the next game, okay, there's going to be a Zerg campaign.

447
00:31:52,346 --> 00:31:53,047
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, I get that.

448
00:31:53,087 --> 00:32:02,096
[SPEAKER_04]: That'll be cool because I'll actually get to learn how to play Zerg because that's the other problem I have with multiplayer right now is that being that I am new to StarCraft, I didn't really get into the first game.

449
00:32:03,637 --> 00:32:06,219
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what I'm doing when I play Zerg or Protoss.

450
00:32:06,259 --> 00:32:08,582
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, yeah, I know they have a lot of the similar stuff, but I don't...

451
00:32:09,022 --> 00:32:09,523
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

452
00:32:24,259 --> 00:32:25,100
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

453
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:47,337
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably a little early for me to be saying something like that because I haven't played the second game.

454
00:32:47,798 --> 00:32:52,166
[SPEAKER_04]: But I just kind of look at it and go, what are they going to add that's going to make it worth all that money?

455
00:32:52,186 --> 00:32:53,649
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I don't see that changing a whole lot.

456
00:32:56,813 --> 00:33:12,452
[SPEAKER_14]: I think I recall the Blizzard developers saying last year that when they announced that they were doing three separate releases, that the campaigns, the story modes for each game is going to be anywhere from 25 to 40 hours, whatever is considered a full game length.

457
00:33:12,872 --> 00:33:16,577
[SPEAKER_14]: Because in StarCraft 1, all three campaigns together made up the game.

458
00:33:17,097 --> 00:33:17,557
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

459
00:33:38,044 --> 00:33:38,784
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not going to be pleased.

460
00:33:38,844 --> 00:33:49,968
[SPEAKER_14]: If you don't care about lore, really, and you're just in it for the multiplayer and the maps, 30 hours of campaign, even if it's like, ooh, let's go into the heart of the politics of the Zerg, it's like, yeah, I don't care.

461
00:33:50,088 --> 00:33:53,470
[SPEAKER_04]: That's 30 hours I could be working on my ranking in League mode, right?

462
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:54,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.

463
00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:57,092
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's going to be very interesting to see how they justify it.

464
00:33:57,152 --> 00:33:58,113
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's going to be tough.

465
00:33:58,613 --> 00:34:01,896
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, I don't know, Blizzard, clearly they know what they're doing.

466
00:34:01,936 --> 00:34:09,363
[SPEAKER_04]: They have much success on the PC, and I'm really excited for Diablo 3, and obviously the new WoW expansion.

467
00:34:10,624 --> 00:34:14,408
[SPEAKER_04]: But at this point, I kind of look at it and go, I don't know if this was the best decision.

468
00:34:15,489 --> 00:34:18,131
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, from a money-making perspective, it was, but...

469
00:34:18,471 --> 00:34:18,951
[SPEAKER_14]: They might do $60, $45, $45.

470
00:34:21,713 --> 00:34:24,495
[SPEAKER_14]: They might take it down a notch on the prize for the latter two.

471
00:34:24,736 --> 00:34:27,417
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder if they're going to do the other two as expansions to the first one.

472
00:34:27,618 --> 00:34:28,738
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to buy the first game.

473
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:31,480
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.

474
00:34:32,761 --> 00:34:34,262
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be, I could see that.

475
00:34:34,362 --> 00:34:39,086
[SPEAKER_04]: If the second and third games were just expansions to the first game, that I get.

476
00:34:39,126 --> 00:34:40,627
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's not the way Blizzard's talking.

477
00:34:41,888 --> 00:34:42,468
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know.

478
00:34:43,208 --> 00:34:47,210
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, anyhow, we're going to get into some gaming news here now that we're done with our gaming week.

479
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:48,371
[SPEAKER_04]: But first, some housekeeping.

480
00:34:48,731 --> 00:34:50,752
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a whole lot of housekeeping I want to share tonight, actually.

481
00:34:50,772 --> 00:34:53,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Just, you know, please join our Facebook if you haven't already.

[SPEAKER_04]: Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio is where our Facebook can be found.

[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to be taking your Twitter topics later on, so if you want to send us some of those, that would be great.

485

[SPEAKER_04]: And, of course, you can always email us at Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

486
00:35:08,063 --> 00:35:10,124
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll get to reading your emails a little later in the show.

487
00:35:10,544 --> 00:35:28,711
[SPEAKER_04]: otherwise um not a lot of uh show no i mean we had last week off i don't see us having another show off until probably i know halloween is on a sunday this year right so there probably is not gonna be a message about that you did but i think it was when i was really intoxicated in reno that's something to discuss later

488
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:33,381
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, how I drank so much in Reno that I actually fell out of the bed.

489
00:35:33,622 --> 00:35:39,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no, I meant Halloween, but... Oh, I just made that up.

490
00:35:39,764 --> 00:35:40,784
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really funny, huh?

491
00:35:40,944 --> 00:35:42,865
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob fell out of the bed.

492
00:35:42,885 --> 00:35:44,145
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

493
00:35:44,425 --> 00:35:45,406
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we'll talk Halloween later.

494
00:35:45,646 --> 00:35:47,266
[SPEAKER_04]: But otherwise, we're set for a little while.

495
00:35:47,566 --> 00:35:47,867
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

496
00:35:48,687 --> 00:35:52,588
[SPEAKER_04]: Or I don't know about Labor Day weekend because that's going to be tough because three-day weekend.

497
00:35:53,188 --> 00:35:53,529
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

498
00:35:54,249 --> 00:35:54,709
[SPEAKER_10]: Drunk show?

499
00:35:56,363 --> 00:35:58,445
[SPEAKER_04]: That might be an idea, actually.

500
00:35:58,705 --> 00:36:00,907
[SPEAKER_04]: We haven't done that in a long, long time.

501
00:36:00,987 --> 00:36:01,648
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we haven't.

502
00:36:01,748 --> 00:36:03,770
[SPEAKER_04]: I doubt Loki would be participating in that.

503
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:04,951
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't think I could.

504
00:36:05,211 --> 00:36:06,432
[SPEAKER_04]: Does Dan drink at all?

505
00:36:06,652 --> 00:36:07,393
[SPEAKER_04]: Can Dan drink?

506
00:36:08,174 --> 00:36:09,255
[SPEAKER_10]: He's not big on it.

507
00:36:09,495 --> 00:36:10,536
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what we should do?

508
00:36:12,523 --> 00:36:14,805
[SPEAKER_04]: We should do the marathon episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

509
00:36:15,686 --> 00:36:16,046
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

510
00:36:16,087 --> 00:36:19,610
[SPEAKER_04]: Because there's nothing on on All Games Radio after us.

511
00:36:20,231 --> 00:36:23,294
[SPEAKER_04]: And we should just honestly see and I don't know how the listeners will feel about this.

512
00:36:23,654 --> 00:36:25,496
[SPEAKER_04]: We should honestly just see We do the regular show.

513
00:36:25,796 --> 00:36:30,741
[SPEAKER_04]: Do the regular show and then just go as long as we possibly can.

514
00:36:31,604 --> 00:36:31,644
[SPEAKER_10]: P.S.

515
00:36:47,415 --> 00:36:49,336
[SPEAKER_04]: Even then, I don't think we'd hit it in just 24 hours.

516
00:36:49,376 --> 00:36:50,937
[SPEAKER_04]: We'd have to go take some serious time.

517
00:36:50,977 --> 00:36:54,078
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll add Gaming Podcast in front of that.

518
00:36:54,958 --> 00:36:58,500
[SPEAKER_02]: The longest episode of the official gaming podcast of the universe.

519
00:36:59,000 --> 00:36:59,921
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking at the chat room.

520
00:37:00,361 --> 00:37:08,244
[SPEAKER_04]: Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com Breakman in our chat room, just for the record, says, Falling out of the bed is way better than falling off the toilet.

521
00:37:09,225 --> 00:37:10,065
[SPEAKER_04]: Haven't done that.

522
00:37:10,966 --> 00:37:11,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

523
00:37:12,267 --> 00:37:13,828
[SPEAKER_04]: The chatroom says, ooh, drunk show.

524
00:37:13,968 --> 00:37:16,570
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, as always, we would drink responsibly.

525
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:19,431
[SPEAKER_04]: If we do have a drunk show, then somebody else is going to have to drive me here.

526
00:37:19,451 --> 00:37:23,634
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how I'll do that, or I'll have to sleep on the vault floor like Jamie's other houseguests do.

527
00:37:24,814 --> 00:37:25,475
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll figure that out.

528
00:37:25,855 --> 00:37:28,297
[SPEAKER_04]: TigerClaw says, so it'll be like an afterbirth XXL.

529
00:37:28,337 --> 00:37:29,137
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, something like that.

530
00:37:31,358 --> 00:37:34,220
[SPEAKER_04]: SSJ100Matt says we should invite Irene and Extifer for this.

531
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:37,042
[SPEAKER_04]: We definitely should try to get other people here if we do that.

532
00:37:37,722 --> 00:38:07,251
[SPEAKER_04]: so we may maybe I'm on to something because we don't I don't have any I'm not going out of town for Labor Day I usually do but I'm not this year that's actually in two weeks I don't have a lot of time I plan on sitting on my ass so maybe I don't know are you available to come up here we need to figure something out I was gonna say if you're staying at home for Labor Day weekend I'm coming up here then so maybe we'll do that and you know I was thinking about going down there but if people feel like crashing so we can sleep in cycles we've got the futon mattresses in the vault I can make it into a bed a comfortable little bed

533
00:38:08,511 --> 00:38:09,992
[SPEAKER_10]: We have comfortable couches.

534
00:38:10,873 --> 00:38:11,613
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll figure something out.

535
00:38:11,853 --> 00:38:12,774
[SPEAKER_04]: That's in two weeks though.

536
00:38:12,814 --> 00:38:14,554
[SPEAKER_04]: I just realized like, oh crap, that's in two weeks.

537
00:38:14,594 --> 00:38:18,116
[SPEAKER_04]: So next week we'll have an answer on what's going to happen in two weeks.

538
00:38:18,656 --> 00:38:18,896
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

539
00:38:19,737 --> 00:38:22,278
[SPEAKER_04]: In the meantime, how about some actual bonafide gaming news?

540
00:38:22,398 --> 00:38:25,159
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, I know you've missed the gaming news, right?

541
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,000
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you doing?

542
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,901
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

543
00:38:51,013 --> 00:38:53,314
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't understand in the back how that's really going to work.

544
00:38:53,714 --> 00:38:56,915
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems a little awkward to me, but I guess we'll see.

545
00:38:59,396 --> 00:39:03,857
[SPEAKER_02]: And apparently this is coming from an unnamed source, according to Eurogamer.

546
00:39:04,658 --> 00:39:04,818
[SPEAKER_02]: And...

547
00:39:07,182 --> 00:39:08,523
[SPEAKER_02]: They were super flimsy.

548
00:39:08,623 --> 00:39:08,763
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

549
00:39:34,315 --> 00:39:34,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

550
00:39:35,155 --> 00:39:35,816
[SPEAKER_02]: Guess what, Sony?

551
00:39:35,836 --> 00:39:38,577
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently people do like to buy physical copies of their games.

552
00:39:39,837 --> 00:39:40,437
[SPEAKER_02]: Who would have thought?

553
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:44,439
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I don't know.

554
00:39:44,459 --> 00:39:48,060
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be interesting to see if this really does anything.

555
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:52,742
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they really should just stick with putting at least a second analog stick on there.

556
00:39:53,302 --> 00:39:59,925
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the actual PSP phone thing had this touch panel that kind of replaced the analog sticks.

557
00:40:00,425 --> 00:40:02,325
[SPEAKER_02]: And you could kind of use it like the analog sticks.

558
00:40:02,345 --> 00:40:03,266
[SPEAKER_02]: It was almost like a strip.

559
00:40:05,474 --> 00:40:07,966
[SPEAKER_02]: which is an interesting idea I guess but

560
00:40:09,716 --> 00:40:10,056
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

561
00:40:10,637 --> 00:40:15,600
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully the system will do a lot better than the last PSP.

562
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,001
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well, the PSP Go did terribly, yes.

563
00:40:18,042 --> 00:40:20,063
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not talking about the original PSP.

564
00:40:20,083 --> 00:40:21,264
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking about the original PSP.

565
00:40:21,324 --> 00:40:22,604
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not done well recently.

566
00:40:22,624 --> 00:40:27,468
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, compared to the DS, but it's done better than a lot of systems do, I would think.

567
00:40:27,668 --> 00:40:30,189
[SPEAKER_04]: What other systems are we talking about out there?

568
00:40:30,209 --> 00:40:38,555
[SPEAKER_04]: The Lynx, the Game Gear, the Gamescom, the... What was that shitty little thing they showed off at E3 a few years ago that was a portable device?

569
00:40:38,775 --> 00:40:39,416
[SPEAKER_08]: The Gizmodo?

570
00:40:39,576 --> 00:40:41,918
[SPEAKER_04]: The Gizmodo, the N-Gage.

571
00:40:42,118 --> 00:40:43,199
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been better than all of those.

572
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,442
[SPEAKER_10]: I like the little guitar game on the Gizmodo, though.

573
00:40:47,223 --> 00:40:47,863
[SPEAKER_04]: Barely, though.

574
00:40:47,883 --> 00:40:48,884
[SPEAKER_10]: Gizmondo, that was it.

575
00:40:49,485 --> 00:40:49,685
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

576
00:40:49,705 --> 00:40:50,106
[SPEAKER_10]: Gizmondo.

577
00:40:50,786 --> 00:40:52,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Gizmodo's a gaming blog.

578
00:40:52,868 --> 00:40:54,009
[SPEAKER_04]: Or something like that.

579
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:55,190
[SPEAKER_02]: Gizmondo, yes.

580
00:40:55,210 --> 00:40:56,451
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a dumb name for a device anyway.

581
00:40:56,471 --> 00:40:57,512
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like Gizmondo.

582
00:40:57,653 --> 00:40:57,953
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-huh.

583
00:40:58,493 --> 00:40:58,794
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

584
00:40:59,114 --> 00:41:00,715
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it's just... I don't know.

585
00:41:00,815 --> 00:41:02,117
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see them doing too much...

586
00:41:03,815 --> 00:41:05,596
[SPEAKER_02]: Stuff that's very different than the last PSP.

587
00:41:06,037 --> 00:41:08,999
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that the system's okay.

588
00:41:09,039 --> 00:41:12,702
[SPEAKER_02]: They just have to make a few enhancements to it and hopefully they'll learn from their mistakes.

589
00:41:15,164 --> 00:41:19,487
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hope for their sake that it's a little more secure as far as cracking it goes.

590
00:41:20,563 --> 00:41:24,104
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, wait, what adds value to these rumors?

591
00:41:24,124 --> 00:41:26,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Because rumors can, you know, kind of come from anywhere.

592
00:41:26,685 --> 00:41:29,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I could say, oh, the next PSP is going to double as a cigarette lighter.

593
00:41:29,685 --> 00:41:30,025
[SPEAKER_04]: Woo-hoo!

594
00:41:30,405 --> 00:41:31,086
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there you go.

595
00:41:31,546 --> 00:41:34,686
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, cut, print, run with it.

596
00:41:34,747 --> 00:41:35,987
[SPEAKER_04]: PSP to have cigarette lighter.

597
00:41:36,567 --> 00:41:39,348
[SPEAKER_04]: But what adds this any value, what they're saying here?

598
00:41:40,568 --> 00:41:40,648
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

599
00:41:42,705 --> 00:41:44,206
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, don't know.

600
00:41:44,686 --> 00:41:47,107
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I guess we don't really know.

601
00:41:47,147 --> 00:41:52,509
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, for all we know, this could be some sort of analyst talking about the system.

602
00:41:52,869 --> 00:41:53,310
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

603
00:41:53,330 --> 00:41:56,511
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see here.

604
00:41:56,871 --> 00:42:02,874
[SPEAKER_02]: It's according to three separate development sources that have seen the new PSP.

605
00:42:04,825 --> 00:42:30,418
[SPEAKER_02]: and they're saying that it's gonna have a touch sensitive area on the back of the unit behind the screen which is weird if you think about it I mean that's just awkward I mean if I'm gonna control a game and the touch screen's on the back unless it like flips over or something so you can do like touch screen type games like the DS or something but I don't know

606
00:42:30,799 --> 00:42:36,361
[SPEAKER_04]: Going to our chatroom at chat.orangelandre.com, Odd1 says, I hope they keep the online functionality of the device.

607
00:42:36,441 --> 00:42:38,182
[SPEAKER_04]: Podcasting, decent web browsing.

608
00:42:38,642 --> 00:42:40,023
[SPEAKER_04]: Shit was kind of cash, you know?

609
00:42:40,203 --> 00:42:41,283
[SPEAKER_04]: And SD cards, yeah.

610
00:42:41,884 --> 00:42:43,184
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of agree.

611
00:42:43,244 --> 00:42:47,906
[SPEAKER_04]: PSP's biggest strength wasn't necessarily the games that were on it, but the fact it was kind of an all-in-one type of thing.

612
00:42:48,046 --> 00:42:51,568
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, minus the phone, but you don't need a phone there.

613
00:42:51,768 --> 00:42:53,689
[SPEAKER_02]: They had their advantage definitely there, but...

614
00:42:54,289 --> 00:42:55,510
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

615
00:43:14,452 --> 00:43:15,093
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

616
00:43:35,095 --> 00:43:57,598
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's about it that's all you really need to do as far as controls go because the control system you know scheme is pretty much the same thing that's on the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360 and it works well you don't need to add some touch screens to it hell if you want to make the screen a touch screen or something that's fine you know so you can type and stuff a lot easier than you know the phone dialing type thing that they had going with it

617
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:17,064
[SPEAKER_02]: that would be fine if you just make the screen a touch screen for that kind of stuff because people dig that and if you want the control scheme for different casual games that would be fine but I don't think they really need to reinvent the controls for the system itself it's pretty good

618
00:44:18,758 --> 00:44:19,979
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well we'll see what happens.

619
00:44:20,019 --> 00:44:24,043
[SPEAKER_04]: I would imagine if there is going to be a new PSP, probably not going to hear anything about it until next year's E3.

620
00:44:24,063 --> 00:44:27,286
[SPEAKER_02]: They're saying it's expected to launch at the end of 2011.

621
00:44:27,326 --> 00:44:31,489
[SPEAKER_02]: Makes sense because you have the 3DS coming out in the beginning of 2011.

622
00:44:31,549 --> 00:44:34,012
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see what happens.

623
00:44:34,232 --> 00:44:36,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it'll do 3D on top of all that.

624
00:44:36,634 --> 00:44:36,914
[SPEAKER_04]: Doubt it.

625
00:44:37,074 --> 00:44:37,315
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

626
00:44:38,075 --> 00:44:56,590
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, by the way, before I get into my next story, I do want to bring this up, because somebody in chat had actually talked about, let's see, it was a little while ago here, but talking about the gaming marathon, or the marathon we were talking about doing over Labor Day weekend, TigerClaw in our chatroom says, seems like a good idea for those of us in the West Coast, or for those in the West Coast, but for the East Coast, it would be enormously late for us.

627
00:44:58,452 --> 00:45:05,778
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually got a message right after that from Bobby Blackwolf, who does the show before us, telling us he's actually going to be out Labor Day weekend.

628
00:45:06,298 --> 00:45:17,968
[SPEAKER_04]: so that means there's going to be no programming on All Games Radio at all on Sunday because DragonCon is that same weekend and PAX so we'd only be going up against PAX and DragonCon just that?

629
00:45:19,309 --> 00:45:30,639
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's a lot of people listening to our show though that aren't able to afford to fly out to Seattle or Atlanta so I'm sure there'll be an audience for it if we want to do it so we'll see we'll have to see what happens

630
00:45:32,196 --> 00:45:32,716
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

631
00:45:52,683 --> 00:45:59,546
[SPEAKER_04]: Except it's Goldeneye with Daniel Craig, which is a little weird, but it is still somewhat of the same game that you should know of before.

632
00:46:00,026 --> 00:46:07,029
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, what's pretty cool is that when the game comes out, they're going to be releasing a bundle that actually comes with a classic controller.

633
00:46:07,569 --> 00:46:13,391
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you want to spend $70, or $69.99 to be exact... It's actually a classic controller pro, by the way.

634
00:46:13,811 --> 00:46:16,132
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's right, because they have the... What's the difference?

635
00:46:16,192 --> 00:46:18,013
[SPEAKER_04]: A classic controller pro... It's got the little grippies on it.

636
00:46:18,113 --> 00:46:20,374
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there's a little bit of extra stuff.

637
00:46:20,834 --> 00:46:23,536
[SPEAKER_04]: But also, not just the fact that it's pro, but it's gold.

638
00:46:24,017 --> 00:46:24,317
[SPEAKER_04]: Get it?

639
00:46:24,557 --> 00:46:25,098
[SPEAKER_04]: Golden eye?

640
00:46:25,658 --> 00:46:26,019
[SPEAKER_04]: Gold?

641
00:46:26,279 --> 00:46:26,959
[SPEAKER_04]: Golden Wii.

642
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:27,380
[SPEAKER_04]: Ha!

643
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:28,641
[SPEAKER_04]: Wii is golden.

644
00:46:29,982 --> 00:46:30,702
[SPEAKER_04]: Golden Wii.

645
00:46:30,803 --> 00:46:34,646
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you want to get a golden controller... Well, there isn't actually a golden Wii.

646
00:46:34,766 --> 00:46:38,709
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a golden classic controller pro for your white Wii or your black Wii.

647
00:46:38,769 --> 00:46:40,691
[SPEAKER_14]: Does it tell you to drink more water if you buy it?

648
00:46:41,371 --> 00:46:42,152
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't... Sorry.

649
00:46:42,512 --> 00:46:42,973
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't lick it.

650
00:46:43,273 --> 00:46:43,513
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

651
00:46:44,214 --> 00:46:45,095
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't lick the golden Wii.

652
00:46:48,069 --> 00:46:54,498
[SPEAKER_04]: No release date announced outside the United States, so if you're in another country, you may not be getting this at all, but you know what?

653
00:46:55,339 --> 00:46:57,642
[SPEAKER_04]: Usually it's the other countries that get all those games.

654
00:46:58,664 --> 00:47:03,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Not the games, the different colors and things for their systems before we do, so you can wait on this one.

655
00:47:04,110 --> 00:47:04,870
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, it sounds cool.

656
00:47:04,890 --> 00:47:06,270
[SPEAKER_04]: I already have a classic controller.

657
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:10,951
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I might not be pro with grippy things, but I don't think I need a second one.

658
00:47:11,191 --> 00:47:16,132
[SPEAKER_04]: Heck, my Wii still isn't even hooked up, although, shit, Metroid's out.

659
00:47:17,172 --> 00:47:17,672
[SPEAKER_02]: Today?

660
00:47:17,692 --> 00:47:19,213
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it today or next week?

661
00:47:19,233 --> 00:47:19,753
[SPEAKER_02]: It's next week.

662
00:47:19,973 --> 00:47:21,113
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, actually, no, I take it back.

663
00:47:21,193 --> 00:47:21,813
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not next week.

664
00:47:21,833 --> 00:47:22,673
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the week after next.

665
00:47:23,494 --> 00:47:24,474
[SPEAKER_02]: Or wait, no, it is next week.

666
00:47:24,514 --> 00:47:25,314
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to be next week.

667
00:47:25,334 --> 00:47:26,334
[SPEAKER_02]: It was last week, August.

668
00:47:26,954 --> 00:47:27,614
[SPEAKER_02]: I keep forgetting.

669
00:47:27,634 --> 00:47:31,555
[SPEAKER_10]: The intro to that, the little trailer that was up is gorgeous.

670
00:47:33,126 --> 00:47:36,328
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks awesome Hope that Oddjob isn't so much of a cheap bitch

671
00:48:00,505 --> 00:48:03,486
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually played as Oddjob, and he was an awesomely cheap bitch.

672
00:48:03,827 --> 00:48:06,408
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

673
00:48:06,728 --> 00:48:14,171
[SPEAKER_10]: Dan and I watched this video that's like the top ten dick moves to pull in a game, and one of them is playing Oddjob in Deathmatch and Goldeneye.

674
00:48:14,831 --> 00:48:17,112
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, now, I don't remember why.

675
00:48:17,392 --> 00:48:18,412
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is he a cheap bitch?

676
00:48:18,793 --> 00:48:19,493
[SPEAKER_10]: Because he's short.

677
00:48:21,525 --> 00:48:24,126
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like when he's right up on you, you can't shoot him.

678
00:48:24,326 --> 00:48:25,627
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to aim low to shoot.

679
00:48:25,867 --> 00:48:27,768
[SPEAKER_04]: But the hat toss thing is the best thing ever.

680
00:48:28,548 --> 00:48:29,109
[SPEAKER_04]: It really is.

681
00:48:29,129 --> 00:48:30,429
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a shoe, honestly.

682
00:48:31,370 --> 00:48:32,630
[SPEAKER_14]: Can I interject something real quick?

683
00:48:32,750 --> 00:48:33,151
[SPEAKER_14]: Absolutely.

684
00:48:33,551 --> 00:48:43,796
[SPEAKER_14]: When we were in Reno at the hotel, I noticed that the direct-to-your-room streaming for video games is N64 games, which is just so backwards and weird to me.

685
00:48:43,836 --> 00:48:44,336
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know why.

686
00:48:45,066 --> 00:48:46,788
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

687
00:49:05,805 --> 00:49:07,546
[SPEAKER_04]: So like too many people can't play it at once?

688
00:49:07,626 --> 00:49:11,329
[SPEAKER_02]: Since I'm on eBay right now, they do sell those systems sometimes.

689
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:19,576
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember what they're called, but they're really expensive and they have like a bunch of different 64 games in there that they can stream.

690
00:49:24,195 --> 00:49:32,263
[SPEAKER_04]: Just while Loki's looking at that, in our chatroom at chat.orange.com, some of the chatters are talking about Netflix on the Wii and a lot of folks using the Wii for Netflix.

691
00:49:32,283 --> 00:49:34,105
[SPEAKER_10]: Isn't that the LodgeNet Nintendo 64?

692
00:49:34,585 --> 00:49:34,905
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

693
00:49:34,965 --> 00:49:35,606
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's it.

694
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:36,107
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

695
00:49:37,328 --> 00:49:43,694
[SPEAKER_04]: That the Wii is a good bedroom gaming console and that a lot of people can get Netflix in their bedroom with that.

696
00:49:44,214 --> 00:49:45,336
[SPEAKER_04]: You do need a disc for that.

697
00:49:45,356 --> 00:49:48,699
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no Netflix channel at this time, but some folks kind of talking about that.

698
00:49:49,539 --> 00:49:53,642
[SPEAKER_04]: Looking at a comment from Odd1 in chat asking, does Goldeneye have online play?

699
00:49:54,143 --> 00:49:55,343
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe it does.

700
00:49:55,504 --> 00:49:58,486
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe the new one on the Wii will have online play, but no voice chat.

701
00:49:59,166 --> 00:50:01,928
[SPEAKER_14]: You just have to double opt in with your 45 digit friend code.

702
00:50:01,968 --> 00:50:02,468
[SPEAKER_14]: Pretty much.

703
00:50:03,149 --> 00:50:04,330
[SPEAKER_14]: Kind of what you're used to in the games.

704
00:50:04,570 --> 00:50:05,010
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I love that.

705
00:50:05,190 --> 00:50:08,913
[SPEAKER_02]: No voice chat, despite the fact we made this accessory that we don't really use at all.

706
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:10,761
[SPEAKER_02]: Go Nintendo.

707
00:50:11,641 --> 00:50:11,961
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

708
00:50:13,803 --> 00:50:16,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so going on, DarkSakura, what do you got for us?

709
00:50:16,725 --> 00:50:18,766
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you know what's better than a Nintendo 64?

710
00:50:20,247 --> 00:50:21,468
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of things, actually.

711
00:50:21,888 --> 00:50:25,310
[SPEAKER_04]: Peanut Butter's better than a Nintendo 64.

712
00:50:25,831 --> 00:50:28,152
[SPEAKER_02]: Mario Kart 64 was fucking awesome.

713
00:50:28,192 --> 00:50:28,753
[SPEAKER_04]: Dreamcast!

714
00:50:28,773 --> 00:50:30,153
[SPEAKER_02]: Peanut Butter is awesome.

715
00:50:30,173 --> 00:50:31,534
[SPEAKER_10]: Dreamcast is pretty awesome.

716
00:50:32,055 --> 00:50:32,535
[SPEAKER_10]: Guess what?

717
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:33,976
[SPEAKER_10]: They're still making games.

718
00:50:34,156 --> 00:50:36,758
[SPEAKER_04]: I had these coconut M&M's today that were delicious.

719
00:50:36,898 --> 00:50:37,859
[SPEAKER_04]: I had mocha M&M's.

720
00:50:37,959 --> 00:50:39,720
[SPEAKER_04]: They were actually better than a Dreamcast.

721
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:41,781
[SPEAKER_10]: I have Mocha M&M's and they're pretty damn good.

722
00:50:42,301 --> 00:50:45,864
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, you can't lick a Dreamcast, but... Well, you could, but it wouldn't be very tasty.

723
00:50:46,444 --> 00:50:47,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Avoid the warranty on that.

724
00:50:47,244 --> 00:50:48,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless you're Jessica Chopin.

725
00:50:49,746 --> 00:50:50,046
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway.

726
00:50:50,066 --> 00:50:51,387
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that who licks the PSP?

727
00:50:51,407 --> 00:50:58,831
[SPEAKER_10]: Red Spot Games, you know, they put out The Last Hope and Wind and Water Puzzle Battles and Rush Rush Rally Racing.

728
00:50:59,852 --> 00:51:02,053
[SPEAKER_10]: They're doing more Dreamcast games.

729
00:51:02,153 --> 00:51:08,217
[SPEAKER_10]: They want to do more and more and they're actually trying to see if companies will release their games on the Dreamcast.

730
00:51:09,017 --> 00:51:24,106
[SPEAKER_10]: so they've got another release planned for next year but to supplement any losses they've actually to supplement their costs they're actually reproducing games for WiiWare and Xbox Live Arcade too

731
00:51:24,386 --> 00:51:30,408
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was going to say they should talk to Sega since they're going to be doing those Dreamcast games on live already.

732
00:51:30,428 --> 00:51:31,388
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, when?

733
00:51:32,948 --> 00:51:33,248
[SPEAKER_04]: Soon.

734
00:51:33,288 --> 00:51:34,249
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's right.

735
00:51:34,269 --> 00:51:36,609
[SPEAKER_04]: They did have Crazy Tax 83, so it's happening.

736
00:51:36,629 --> 00:51:43,671
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, and the guy behind it, he totally wants Sega to start producing for the Dreamcast again, which I kind of think isn't going to happen.

737
00:51:45,051 --> 00:51:46,372
[SPEAKER_04]: What could possibly make you think that?

738
00:51:47,992 --> 00:51:50,733
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe because they've said themselves the Dreamcast is over.

739
00:51:50,753 --> 00:51:51,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

740
00:51:53,032 --> 00:51:55,494
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, yeah, who's going to produce new Dreamcast hardware?

741
00:51:55,834 --> 00:52:02,680
[SPEAKER_04]: How long is it before the patents are up on those things and then all the, you know, Korean and Chinese knockoff systems can come out like the Nintendos?

742
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:13,668
[SPEAKER_04]: The patents are up on the old school Nintendos and you see all these new Nintendos coming out that are, you know, they don't have the blow on the cartridge problem or any of that stuff.

743
00:52:13,708 --> 00:52:15,309
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's all kind of different now.

744
00:52:15,630 --> 00:52:17,431
[SPEAKER_10]: I want the Famicom Disk System personally.

745
00:52:18,208 --> 00:52:20,610
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's one out there that plays NES and Genesis games.

746
00:52:20,790 --> 00:52:21,530
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to say I saw.

747
00:52:21,550 --> 00:52:24,092
[SPEAKER_10]: I have something that'll do that.

748
00:52:24,693 --> 00:52:26,354
[SPEAKER_10]: I have an NES and I have a Genesis.

749
00:52:26,394 --> 00:52:27,595
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a Genesis one.

750
00:52:27,615 --> 00:52:28,615
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have a PC.

751
00:52:28,795 --> 00:52:30,377
[SPEAKER_02]: The portable Genesis one.

752
00:52:30,897 --> 00:52:32,498
[SPEAKER_02]: They have, of course, a portable Nintendo one.

753
00:52:32,518 --> 00:52:33,579
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a portable Genesis.

754
00:52:33,639 --> 00:52:34,319
[SPEAKER_10]: It's called a Nomad.

755
00:52:34,339 --> 00:52:35,640
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to say it's about 20 years.

756
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:39,003
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I have a feeling the Super Nintendo one's going to lapse really soon.

757
00:52:39,363 --> 00:52:40,043
[SPEAKER_04]: It already has.

758
00:52:40,083 --> 00:52:41,584
[SPEAKER_04]: They have Super Nintendo systems out there.

759
00:52:41,645 --> 00:52:42,305
[SPEAKER_04]: Do they really?

760
00:52:42,385 --> 00:52:42,605
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

761
00:52:43,266 --> 00:52:43,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

762
00:52:44,106 --> 00:52:48,350
[SPEAKER_10]: Hurry up and give me my new duo LTs and I'll be happy.

763
00:52:49,390 --> 00:53:02,601
[SPEAKER_04]: But it would be interesting, I mean, not to deviate too much from the topic at hand, but even if Sega didn't want to do the Dreamcast themselves, license, you know, before the patent lapses, if they're just going to sit on it, let someone else develop a Dreamcast.

764
00:53:02,621 --> 00:53:05,062
[SPEAKER_12]: I honestly think the Dreamcast games are still pretty solid.

765
00:53:05,082 --> 00:53:06,183
[SPEAKER_04]: You're cut out for some reason.

766
00:53:06,243 --> 00:53:06,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

767
00:53:07,084 --> 00:53:09,146
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the Dreamcast games are still pretty solid.

768
00:53:10,006 --> 00:53:12,428
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I've gone back and wanted to play stuff up.

769
00:53:12,448 --> 00:53:13,609
[SPEAKER_10]: I was talking to Dan today about

770
00:53:16,004 --> 00:53:17,905
[SPEAKER_10]: because, well, you know, I'm still kind of hot.

771
00:53:18,065 --> 00:53:18,986
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you're cut out again.

772
00:53:19,046 --> 00:53:20,307
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm holding the thing in.

773
00:53:20,687 --> 00:53:22,309
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm telling you, we're not hearing you.

774
00:53:22,909 --> 00:53:27,213
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I'm still wanting to play Sonic Colors when it comes out.

775
00:53:27,473 --> 00:53:29,234
[SPEAKER_10]: So I've been like, let's play Sonic Adventure.

776
00:53:30,275 --> 00:53:30,515
[SPEAKER_10]: So.

777
00:53:32,517 --> 00:53:32,817
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

778
00:53:33,538 --> 00:53:36,840
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we'll see how successful this venture is.

779
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:41,464
[SPEAKER_04]: It was also really easy to pirate Dreamcast games, so we'll have to see how successful this venture is.

780
00:53:42,096 --> 00:53:45,237
[SPEAKER_10]: And hey, even if you couldn't get the game to burn right, you'd always get a great soundtrack.

781
00:53:45,757 --> 00:53:45,958
[SPEAKER_02]: True.

782
00:53:46,378 --> 00:53:50,219
[SPEAKER_02]: And those games that that company's putting out, they are out there.

783
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:52,840
[SPEAKER_02]: For piracy reasons.

784
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:53,761
[SPEAKER_02]: Why am I not surprised?

785
00:53:55,401 --> 00:53:58,683
[SPEAKER_02]: I just run them on my cabinet at home because I have a Dreamcast simulator on there.

786
00:53:58,823 --> 00:54:01,844
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, Fresh Rush Rally or whatever is pretty awesome.

787
00:54:01,884 --> 00:54:03,144
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know where to buy that game.

788
00:54:04,105 --> 00:54:04,885
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that I would anyways.

789
00:54:04,965 --> 00:54:05,765
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like 40 bucks.

790
00:54:06,406 --> 00:54:07,506
[SPEAKER_02]: 40 bucks for a Dreamcast game?

791
00:54:08,106 --> 00:54:08,667
[SPEAKER_02]: Nowadays?

792
00:54:09,307 --> 00:54:09,407
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

793
00:54:11,181 --> 00:54:13,843
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, so it's kind of funny.

794
00:54:14,583 --> 00:54:29,392
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, Microsoft got this great idea, excellent idea, that they're going to digitally distribute review copies of Halo Reach to the press or press people or whomever they have that they're distributing this to.

795
00:54:30,292 --> 00:54:51,866
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's available in a games on demand format through live in fact some people found it actually on the marketplace for 99,999 Microsoft points which is just you know it's just that's not showing up at the console right that's some website trick actually showing it showing up on the website

796
00:54:52,706 --> 00:55:18,359
[SPEAKER_02]: and you know obviously even if you did have the $1,250 to purchase the game it would let you purchase the game unfortunately though even though it did come up on there someone found a way to download it and then people found a way to crack it and now it's leaked out there thanks to Microsoft

797
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:20,479
[SPEAKER_04]: GameTutorial.com GameTutorial.com GameTutorial.com

798
00:55:34,964 --> 00:55:39,846
[SPEAKER_02]: They originally downloaded it and then they're like, ha ha, we have it, we're not going to share it with anybody.

799
00:55:40,166 --> 00:55:49,388
[SPEAKER_02]: And somehow their copy leaked out to somebody else that was less scrupulous than they were and sent it out to the community and everybody figured out how to crack it immediately.

800
00:55:49,788 --> 00:55:51,469
[SPEAKER_04]: That website got it legitimately?

801
00:55:51,889 --> 00:55:59,031
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they found a way to hack the live server or whatever to download it without actually having to have the code and stuff.

802
00:55:59,971 --> 00:56:02,372
[SPEAKER_02]: So they did that and...

803
00:56:04,966 --> 00:56:08,608
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so it's not too good for Microsoft.

804
00:56:08,628 --> 00:56:14,310
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, they're investigating how people are able to get this.

805
00:56:14,750 --> 00:56:16,371
[SPEAKER_04]: Once it's on the internet, it's out there.

806
00:56:16,451 --> 00:56:19,272
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a really bad one to lose, too.

807
00:56:19,333 --> 00:56:24,175
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'm surprised that they didn't test this on not so much of a AAA title.

808
00:56:25,555 --> 00:56:28,477
[SPEAKER_02]: They did it with Crackdown 2, apparently.

809
00:56:29,417 --> 00:56:30,298
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on there like that.

810
00:56:30,738 --> 00:56:36,461
[SPEAKER_02]: But it didn't matter with Crackdown 2, because that got leaked out a week or two before it was actually released.

811
00:56:36,881 --> 00:56:41,404
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been leaked out, what, three weeks before it comes out?

812
00:56:42,264 --> 00:56:50,929
[SPEAKER_02]: And the format that they've broken down to now, because Games on Demand packages are basically how you install a game onto your hard drive or something like that.

813
00:56:50,949 --> 00:56:51,609
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that format.

814
00:56:51,869 --> 00:57:17,997
[SPEAKER_02]: or if you download it from their service it's the same format but you're just downloading it and it's signed to your console but consoles out there that are hacked with JTAG basically they can run pretty much anything and there's a program out there to convert the games on demand packages to ISO or like a disk format and then you just dump all the files on there so that's what they basically did after they cracked the file that was on there.

815
00:57:18,277 --> 00:57:19,218
[SPEAKER_04]: It's interesting.

816
00:57:19,379 --> 00:57:19,699
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead.

817
00:57:20,159 --> 00:57:20,320
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

818
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:24,344
[SPEAKER_04]: Monty Boggs in our chatroom at chat.org.com says Bungie will ban Hammer.

819
00:57:24,865 --> 00:57:26,287
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, kind of an interesting point.

820
00:57:26,347 --> 00:57:33,856
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, because this is all being done digitally and these copies are signed, isn't there a way that Microsoft could ban Hammer all the consoles that have this?

821
00:57:34,156 --> 00:57:48,552
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yes and no, because yes, they could ban them if they were dumb enough to take them online, but these copies that are out there right now are used on JTAG systems, which are not used for online play.

822
00:57:48,872 --> 00:57:53,177
[SPEAKER_02]: JTAG systems would get banned anyways if you connected live after about four hours or so.

823
00:57:53,677 --> 00:57:55,039
[SPEAKER_02]: You would get your console banned.

824
00:57:55,779 --> 00:58:24,751
[SPEAKER_02]: um so these systems are just meant for playing so what they're doing now is to play online is they're using tunneling services to use system like over the internet to play other people so that's how they're getting around it so they don't care that they can't connect the live because they're gonna oh they use like a like a warp pipe style thing yes exactly so they're using tunneling services um to basically play online and stuff like that so that's not a big deal and also you know they're not really missing out on anything if there's download content because

825
00:58:25,193 --> 00:58:27,214
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this why we see less and less games supporting System Link?

826
00:58:29,329 --> 00:58:32,091
[SPEAKER_04]: My mind goes to StarCraft 2 and the LAN thing.

827
00:58:32,591 --> 00:58:34,632
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the LAN thing, that's something different.

828
00:58:34,672 --> 00:58:45,318
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the reason why consoles don't use System Link nowadays is because the games are so sophisticated that they have trouble running them as a server and also running the game at the same time.

829
00:58:45,338 --> 00:58:47,660
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just not easy for them to do it.

830
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:51,482
[SPEAKER_02]: They have to program it efficiently enough to where they can do that.

831
00:58:51,622 --> 00:58:53,443
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish Grand Theft Auto was System Link because...

832
00:58:55,604 --> 00:58:58,546
[SPEAKER_02]: We would still be playing our mod game because we wouldn't have to update anything.

833
00:58:58,646 --> 00:59:01,628
[SPEAKER_02]: So we could have been doing that, but we had to play over live.

834
00:59:01,988 --> 00:59:06,971
[SPEAKER_02]: Red Dead Redemption was system link, and that's awesome because our internet connection at work sucks.

835
00:59:07,151 --> 00:59:09,413
[SPEAKER_02]: And so a lot of times we get disconnected from live.

836
00:59:09,853 --> 00:59:11,554
[SPEAKER_02]: So system link is definitely the way to go.

837
00:59:11,754 --> 00:59:15,117
[SPEAKER_02]: And also we used to play Saints Row 2, which was a good backup game.

838
00:59:15,177 --> 00:59:18,539
[SPEAKER_02]: If our live ever went down, we could just play a system link game of that.

839
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:36,722
[SPEAKER_02]: and of course Call of Duty and Halo is always supported systemically because of the land play and stuff like that so they're not going to just take it out because of piracy but yeah it kind of sucks they tried to bypass it but unfortunately there's no way around it

840
00:59:37,102 --> 00:59:37,362
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

841
01:00:07,956 --> 01:00:08,296
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

842
01:00:08,696 --> 01:00:13,037
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I mean, it's tragic, but, you know, that sort of thing happens.

843
01:00:13,678 --> 01:00:25,501
[SPEAKER_02]: What's also funny, though, actually kind of tying in with the hacking stuff, there was a USB mod chip announced actually for the PlayStation 3 that's going to be released next week.

844
01:00:26,281 --> 01:00:29,562
[SPEAKER_02]: And apparently this chip kind of works like...

845
01:00:30,882 --> 01:00:35,385
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess a tool that they have for actual PlayStation repair and stuff like that.

846
01:00:35,445 --> 01:00:39,308
[SPEAKER_02]: It puts the system into a developer's mode where you can run unsigned code.

847
01:00:40,088 --> 01:00:46,533
[SPEAKER_02]: And apparently this chip or whatever, the USB card, can be updated.

848
01:00:46,573 --> 01:00:50,435
[SPEAKER_02]: You can update the firmware on it so that it can never really be locked out from the system.

849
01:00:50,955 --> 01:01:00,042
[SPEAKER_02]: And also you're going to be able to dump games to your hard drive and run them straight off your hard drive like you could with the PlayStation 2 HD loader and stuff like that.

850
01:01:01,403 --> 01:01:02,624
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something that would be interesting.

851
01:01:02,644 --> 01:01:06,027
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called the PS Jailbreak, even though I don't really think it's a jailbreak.

852
01:01:06,127 --> 01:01:11,252
[SPEAKER_02]: But that will be coming out next week, which will be interesting.

853
01:01:11,472 --> 01:01:23,463
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, what about – I saw this story on some websites, and the story said, well, we don't know what's going on because they're just showing this running on a debug system, which is they're showing a feature that isn't new for a debug system.

854
01:01:23,683 --> 01:01:25,525
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that was that one video that was from –

855
01:01:27,006 --> 01:01:30,408
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't remember if it was osmodchips.com or something like that.

856
01:01:30,428 --> 01:01:33,269
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of the stores that's selling them online.

857
01:01:33,289 --> 01:01:35,651
[SPEAKER_02]: They were showing it running on their debug system.

858
01:01:36,071 --> 01:01:44,295
[SPEAKER_02]: But the thing is, the company or whomever that made these chips sent it out to a bunch of different sites to review and test out and stuff like that.

859
01:01:44,435 --> 01:01:49,418
[SPEAKER_02]: And there were other people that do not have debug systems that were running it and doing the same thing.

860
01:01:49,898 --> 01:01:52,099
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't Sony patch this out in minutes?

861
01:01:53,040 --> 01:02:01,405
[SPEAKER_02]: No, because it's the same tool that they use to fix their consoles, so they can't really patch it out because it would fuck up, I think, developer consoles or something like that.

862
01:02:02,706 --> 01:02:16,074
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if they did, basically what they would have to do is ban a certain USB ID or something like that so that it would detect, okay, this is this card, so we're going to make it so that you can't run this anymore.

863
01:02:17,396 --> 01:02:21,603
[SPEAKER_02]: but all they can do is they update the firmware on that card and they can change that ID or whatever.

864
01:02:24,287 --> 01:02:28,154
[SPEAKER_02]: They say that there's no way to ban it and I'd be willing to bet though that

865
01:02:30,277 --> 01:02:31,959
[SPEAKER_02]: They may patch it and they may fix it again.

866
01:02:32,139 --> 01:02:35,602
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like with the PSP or the DS or the Wii or anything.

867
01:02:36,383 --> 01:02:41,527
[SPEAKER_02]: They put out patches that fix things and fix loopholes, but it may be too hard.

868
01:02:41,687 --> 01:02:49,414
[SPEAKER_02]: And on the other thing too, what this is supposed to do is it will also disable forced updates, forced system updates.

869
01:02:49,494 --> 01:02:54,339
[SPEAKER_02]: So, for example, newer software that comes out has the newer system versions and stuff like that.

870
01:02:54,859 --> 01:03:00,803
[SPEAKER_02]: and you can actually disable it from updating your system so if you're playing offline that won't even be an issue.

871
01:03:02,704 --> 01:03:02,984
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

872
01:03:03,004 --> 01:03:12,250
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be interesting to watch because now the one console system that was the most secure has now just been cracked wide open so it'll be interesting to see.

873
01:03:14,091 --> 01:03:19,655
[SPEAKER_04]: VidPower in our chatroom says, what is with the term jailbreaking being used for everything that involves hacking?

874
01:03:20,655 --> 01:03:22,256
[SPEAKER_04]: The iPhones use that term too.

875
01:03:22,716 --> 01:03:23,057
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

876
01:03:23,077 --> 01:03:23,657
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

877
01:03:24,139 --> 01:03:26,120
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a clever term and it caught on.

878
01:03:27,381 --> 01:03:28,202
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a buzzword.

879
01:03:29,042 --> 01:03:29,843
[SPEAKER_04]: It's trendy.

880
01:03:29,983 --> 01:03:33,605
[SPEAKER_14]: It kind of makes sense for the iPhone, but it's trendy, so everyone wants to use it now.

881
01:03:35,006 --> 01:03:38,248
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm thinking about jailbreaking my phone just so I can downgrade the stupid OS.

882
01:03:39,148 --> 01:03:41,410
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate iOS 4 on a 3G.

883
01:03:42,370 --> 01:03:48,014
[SPEAKER_04]: Supposedly there's a patch coming, but we'll be waiting, what, two months?

884
01:03:48,154 --> 01:03:53,457
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, I just updated the patch on my 3GS, and I've noticed it running a little bit better.

885
01:03:54,325 --> 01:04:00,682
[SPEAKER_10]: 3GSs are different though I know, but I'm saying that could have been it could have included some fixes I'm not going to hold my breath

886
01:04:01,434 --> 01:04:02,295
[SPEAKER_04]: Diablo 2 Diablo 3 Diablo 4

887
01:04:24,714 --> 01:04:51,369
[SPEAKER_04]: Torchlight originally they wanted to put Torchlight on Xbox Live Arcade but they actually I guess kind of held off for whatever reason didn't end up doing it but now they're apparently putting serious effort into actually making a console version of Torchlight and it was announced at Gamescom by the Runix CEO Max Schaefer quote we're trying we're talking to Sony and Microsoft and we hope to get that done quickly they want to have it available by the holidays

888
01:04:51,949 --> 01:05:02,184
[SPEAKER_04]: Just so you know, this game's actually already moved about 750,000 units, so it's already almost sold close to a million, which isn't bad for a game like this that's been mostly digital distribution.

889
01:05:03,245 --> 01:05:07,852
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I got it on one of those crazy Steam sales, and I'm sure a lot of you guys did as well.

890
01:05:08,833 --> 01:05:09,414
[SPEAKER_04]: Get it that way.

891
01:05:11,095 --> 01:05:14,137
[SPEAKER_04]: Piracy apparently has been an issue with this game, unfortunately.

892
01:05:14,257 --> 01:05:17,019
[SPEAKER_04]: So they can't track how many illegal copies are going on out there.

893
01:05:17,459 --> 01:05:24,724
[SPEAKER_04]: But seeing as Torchlight 2 is going to be multiplayer, and especially if this does go to Xbox Live and so forth, they'll have that to think about.

894
01:05:25,044 --> 01:05:26,365
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll be able to track that a little better.

895
01:05:27,566 --> 01:05:30,288
[SPEAKER_04]: There's also a Torchlight MMO happening at some point.

896
01:05:30,948 --> 01:05:31,448
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll see.

897
01:05:32,309 --> 01:05:36,691
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be interesting, though, if Torchlight goes to Xbox Live and PSN because it's only single player.

898
01:05:37,071 --> 01:05:39,472
[SPEAKER_04]: One of its biggest drawbacks is there isn't really multiplayer in it.

899
01:05:39,492 --> 01:05:40,733
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why they're doing Torchlight 2.

900
01:05:41,393 --> 01:05:46,956
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of the games on Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network really thrive on a multiplayer environment.

901
01:05:46,996 --> 01:05:47,537
[SPEAKER_04]: Not all of them.

902
01:05:47,657 --> 01:05:49,998
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, what, Mega Man 9 isn't really multiplayer?

903
01:05:50,818 --> 01:05:54,240
[SPEAKER_04]: There's other stuff out there that doesn't have to be multiplayer.

904
01:05:54,780 --> 01:05:54,920
[SPEAKER_04]: But...

905
01:05:56,681 --> 01:06:00,403
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be very cool to have a Diablo-style game on Xbox Live, I think.

906
01:06:00,543 --> 01:06:00,823
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

907
01:06:00,843 --> 01:06:01,204
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think?

908
01:06:01,224 --> 01:06:02,825
[SPEAKER_04]: You're a fan of Torchlight, right, Alan?

909
01:06:02,865 --> 01:06:06,366
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think of this game moving to the consoles?

910
01:06:06,947 --> 01:06:14,871
[SPEAKER_14]: Whatever will help it get a larger audience so that if the MMO does come out, it'll succeed, then I'm all for it.

911
01:06:16,171 --> 01:06:16,492
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

912
01:06:17,572 --> 01:06:21,174
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move on to some more gaming news, then we'll get to some release dates, DarkSakura.

913
01:06:21,932 --> 01:06:27,037
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you know how some places have these archaic laws on their books?

914
01:06:27,618 --> 01:06:31,662
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, in Alabama, it's illegal to walk around with an ice cream cone in your back pocket.

915
01:06:31,942 --> 01:06:32,403
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you hear that?

916
01:06:33,533 --> 01:06:34,714
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I want to go and just do it.

917
01:06:35,035 --> 01:06:37,678
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you can walk around with an ice cream cone in your backpack.

918
01:06:37,698 --> 01:06:38,179
[SPEAKER_02]: It would crunch.

919
01:06:38,519 --> 01:06:40,001
[SPEAKER_10]: It's possible, but it'd get soggy.

920
01:06:41,402 --> 01:06:47,890
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, the city of Beacon, New York has one that says that there can't be pinball tables.

921
01:06:47,930 --> 01:06:48,971
[SPEAKER_10]: They're illegal there.

922
01:06:49,532 --> 01:06:51,855
[SPEAKER_10]: And now they're enforcing it.

923
01:06:52,075 --> 01:06:53,036
[SPEAKER_10]: They've shut down a...

924
01:06:55,643 --> 01:06:56,504
[SPEAKER_04]: They shut down a retro arcade.

925
01:06:56,544 --> 01:06:57,585
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, them darn kids.

926
01:07:13,180 --> 01:07:14,861
[SPEAKER_04]: You might have to switch mics.

927
01:07:14,881 --> 01:07:21,367
[SPEAKER_10]: The Mayor of Beacon said it was about noise.

928
01:07:21,867 --> 01:07:24,910
[SPEAKER_10]: That people complained about the noise and blah blah blah blah blah.

929
01:07:26,451 --> 01:07:32,076
[SPEAKER_10]: And so they said we'll just use this law as a convenient excuse to enforce the noise thing.

930
01:07:32,536 --> 01:07:33,417
[SPEAKER_10]: Which is bull.

931
01:07:34,297 --> 01:07:35,378
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean seriously?

932
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:37,100
[SPEAKER_10]: Noise?

933
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:37,220
[SPEAKER_10]: Noise?

934
01:07:38,764 --> 01:07:42,708
[SPEAKER_10]: I would actually like to see what other businesses are around the people that supposedly complained.

935
01:07:43,909 --> 01:07:48,293
[SPEAKER_04]: So... I'd like to... You know, I think it was on CNN or one of the news channels.

936
01:07:48,313 --> 01:07:50,915
[SPEAKER_04]: They were actually showing this place, and it actually looked kind of cool.

937
01:07:51,355 --> 01:07:55,078
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm thinking, like, I've never heard of this town until this happened, but...

938
01:07:55,859 --> 01:07:56,800
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

939
01:08:20,077 --> 01:08:21,258
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, he's shooting himself in the foot.

940
01:08:21,598 --> 01:08:29,742
[SPEAKER_10]: And the guy's saying, oh, we tried to help them save their business and find them other locations and use decibel tests to be objective and blah, blah, blah.

941
01:08:30,322 --> 01:08:31,342
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just crap.

942
01:08:32,523 --> 01:08:33,243
[SPEAKER_04]: That's unfortunate.

943
01:08:33,323 --> 01:08:33,704
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

944
01:08:34,444 --> 01:08:38,986
[SPEAKER_14]: The loudest thing that happens when I play pinball is when I miss and I go, god damn it!

945
01:08:39,887 --> 01:08:41,627
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm just yelling at the table.

946
01:08:41,727 --> 01:08:43,628
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think maybe that's what happened there?

947
01:08:43,668 --> 01:08:46,210
[SPEAKER_04]: Was just an outbreak of people saying, god damn it, shit!

948
01:08:46,430 --> 01:08:46,590
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

949
01:08:47,691 --> 01:08:50,136
[SPEAKER_10]: If they had good carpeting, it would have totally muted the noise.

950
01:08:51,448 --> 01:09:00,773
[SPEAKER_04]: There used to be that, there was a little tiny arcade out in Roseville called Supercade years and years ago run by this old gentleman that sadly he got put out of business.

951
01:09:00,793 --> 01:09:02,234
[SPEAKER_04]: But he was in the middle of a strip mall.

952
01:09:02,714 --> 01:09:09,638
[SPEAKER_04]: He had tons of pinball games and arcade games and he never got noise complaints or what have you.

953
01:09:09,658 --> 01:09:15,522
[SPEAKER_10]: There's people that own retro arcade tables and have them out in the Galleria in a hallway.

954
01:09:15,622 --> 01:09:15,922
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, wow.

955
01:09:16,142 --> 01:09:17,142
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

956
01:09:17,162 --> 01:09:17,783
[SPEAKER_10]: So in the Danos.

957
01:09:18,223 --> 01:09:18,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

958
01:09:20,604 --> 01:09:20,864
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

959
01:09:21,345 --> 01:09:24,366
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's start to travel the world and take a look at some release dates.

960
01:09:24,726 --> 01:09:27,588
[SPEAKER_04]: And hopefully these games will not be banned in your local city.

961
01:09:28,638 --> 01:09:33,240
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, not a whole lot coming out this week, but there's some pretty good stuff.

962
01:09:34,081 --> 01:09:36,122
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just start with the stuff.

963
01:09:36,582 --> 01:09:37,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Not necessarily good stuff.

964
01:09:39,083 --> 01:09:41,685
[SPEAKER_02]: Martian Panic from Zoo Games.

965
01:09:41,765 --> 01:09:48,148
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a generic arcade shooter game available with a neon green shotgun or by itself.

966
01:09:48,628 --> 01:09:50,889
[SPEAKER_02]: It does, of course, on the Wii.

967
01:09:50,969 --> 01:09:52,450
[SPEAKER_02]: Nancy Drew, Secrets Can Kill 2010.

968
01:09:52,490 --> 01:09:52,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Coming out on PC.

01:09:56,692 --> 01:10:01,395
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, Elemental War of Magic on PC as well from Stardock.

970
01:10:02,716 --> 01:10:05,277
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, oh god, I forgot this was coming out.

971
01:10:06,598 --> 01:10:23,547
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, because someone thought it was a great idea to put Grease the Musical, um, or like the sing-along version of it, I guess, in theaters, there's Grease the Video Game coming out on Wii and DS, where you can sing and dance with the cast of Grease in their cartoony form.

972
01:10:24,348 --> 01:10:24,548
[SPEAKER_02]: Fun.

973
01:10:24,568 --> 01:10:25,068
[SPEAKER_02]: Um,

974
01:10:26,529 --> 01:10:53,141
[SPEAKER_02]: this is pretty cool Gunblade NYC and LA Machine Guns a game I seriously played tons of back in QZAR days coming to the Wii as well for a wonderful $30 retail price just like that House of Dead 2 and 3 collection it should be pretty fun gotta go back and play Ghost Squad some more man that's some fun stuff Elemental War of Magic the limited edition will also be coming out this week as well

975
01:10:54,241 --> 01:11:00,245
[SPEAKER_02]: Mafia 2 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and PC this week.

976
01:11:01,606 --> 01:11:03,186
[SPEAKER_02]: That game from 2K.

977
01:11:04,027 --> 01:11:06,729
[SPEAKER_02]: Harvest Moon Grand Bazaar on DS this week.

978
01:11:07,709 --> 01:11:08,630
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a game for Rob.

979
01:11:08,950 --> 01:11:12,192
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello Kitty Online coming out on PC this week.

980
01:11:13,152 --> 01:11:14,513
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, I thought this had been out for a while.

981
01:11:15,788 --> 01:11:17,629
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, apparently it's a disc version of the game.

982
01:11:17,849 --> 01:11:19,871
[SPEAKER_04]: It might have been just digital before.

983
01:11:20,651 --> 01:11:23,533
[SPEAKER_02]: NHL 2K11 on the Wii coming out this week.

984

[SPEAKER_02]: The Bachelor, The Video Game

01:11:58,621 --> 01:11:59,282
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

987
01:12:16,094 --> 01:12:21,121
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, The Bachelor video game is eventually going to come out at some point, then making way for probably more crappier games.

988
01:12:21,181 --> 01:12:26,247
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, actually, no, it's making way for more crappier games like Survivor and Minute to Win It.

989
01:12:27,048 --> 01:12:31,453
[SPEAKER_02]: And pretty much any game show that's on TV now is going to have a game based on it.

990
01:12:31,874 --> 01:12:32,835
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's going to be on the Wii.

991
01:12:33,157 --> 01:12:34,758

01:13:30,792 --> 01:13:31,073
[SPEAKER_02]: And...

1000
01:13:33,704 --> 01:13:34,885
[SPEAKER_02]: And I believe that's it.

1001
01:13:35,205 --> 01:13:37,807
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no, there's a couple other crappy games here at the very end.

[SPEAKER_02]: Farmtopia on the DS, my first dollhouse on the DS, and Prison Tycoon Alcatraz on PC.

[SPEAKER_04]: Chat.orange.com, more comments from the chat room.

1005
01:13:50,136 --> 01:13:52,337
[SPEAKER_04]: Breakman in our chat says, yay, Amazing Race.

1006
01:13:52,437 --> 01:13:53,638
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, what's the Amazing Race?

1007
01:13:54,079 --> 01:13:58,802
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a TV show here, and I thought they had it in other countries, maybe not.

1008
01:13:59,002 --> 01:13:59,262
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

1009
01:14:21,849 --> 01:14:22,569
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a show.

1010
01:14:23,049 --> 01:14:23,830
[SPEAKER_04]: And let's see.

[SPEAKER_04]: Asks Frisbee.

1014
01:14:30,611 --> 01:14:31,211
[SPEAKER_04]: Excellent question.

1015
01:14:31,231 --> 01:14:32,632
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the best reality show they ever did.

1016
01:14:33,032 --> 01:14:36,353
[SPEAKER_04]: Monty Boggs says, how come Big Brother Wii doesn't sound appealing to me?

1017
01:14:36,413 --> 01:14:36,993
[SPEAKER_04]: Ha ha ha.

1018
01:14:37,333 --> 01:14:38,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you're not trashy.

1019
01:14:38,633 --> 01:14:39,973
[SPEAKER_02]: They still may do that.

1020
01:14:40,013 --> 01:14:41,314
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you think about it.

1021
01:14:41,614 --> 01:14:43,134
[SPEAKER_02]: If the Survivor game sells, why not?

1022
01:14:43,174 --> 01:14:45,855
[SPEAKER_02]: They had, was it America's Top...

1023
01:14:46,315 --> 01:14:47,436
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they have America's Top Model?

1024
01:14:47,456 --> 01:14:47,896
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they do.

1025
01:14:48,136 --> 01:14:54,460
[SPEAKER_02]: They had America's Top Model and... What other crappy games did they have?

1026
01:14:56,301 --> 01:14:58,583
[SPEAKER_02]: Wipeout, they had a thing for that.

1027
01:14:58,603 --> 01:15:05,067
[SPEAKER_04]: I get Minute to Win It because they're just going to do Wii versions of all those stupid games they play on that show.

1028
01:15:05,367 --> 01:15:09,129
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to Target, the game, and buy paper cups and ping pong balls.

1029
01:15:09,229 --> 01:15:09,590
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like...

1030
01:15:10,370 --> 01:15:18,509
[SPEAKER_04]: Pay somebody a million dollars to do the tricks I'm surprised they don't have a home game yet I believe it's coming out If it's not already out

1031
01:15:20,069 --> 01:15:22,271
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not hard to do a home version a minute to win it.

1032
01:15:22,411 --> 01:15:23,512
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to the dollar store.

1033
01:15:23,972 --> 01:15:24,593
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

1034
01:15:24,653 --> 01:15:25,754
[SPEAKER_04]: Dollar store the game.

1035
01:15:27,935 --> 01:15:30,798
[SPEAKER_04]: SSG100 Matt says, Robin Allen should be on The Amazing Race.

1036
01:15:30,898 --> 01:15:31,919
[SPEAKER_04]: Them or Robin Jamie?

1037
01:15:32,419 --> 01:15:38,324
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I don't know how Allen feels about being on network TV like The Amazing Race, but I gotta say me and my friend Victoria have been talking about it for at least two years.

1038
01:15:38,744 --> 01:15:40,245
[SPEAKER_04]: How badly we need to go on The Amazing Race.

1039
01:15:40,626 --> 01:15:49,453
[SPEAKER_14]: And I don't drive and there's usually, you know, you have to get into like a Jeep and one person does something while the other person drives and I couldn't do that.

1040
01:15:50,017 --> 01:16:15,422
[SPEAKER_04]: My favorite task I ever saw in The Amazing Race was when they were in Thailand and they had to get in these taxis but they're karaoke taxis and they actually had to sing Thai karaoke songs from point A to point B or whatever but they were actually singing with women in the backseat but they were actually female impersonators and some of the teams didn't even catch on to it that they were singing with Taiwan Asian female impersonators.

1041
01:16:15,582 --> 01:16:18,003
[SPEAKER_14]: Was there like a bro team asking for their number?

1042
01:16:18,503 --> 01:16:33,300
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there was you know if there was they showed it on TV but the challenge cracked me up because it was I do for Xenocore they do need a supermarket sweep game I thought there was one a while ago a supermarket sweep game like on PC or something yeah yeah

1043
01:16:34,220 --> 01:16:34,921
[SPEAKER_14]: I love that game.

1044
01:16:35,141 --> 01:16:38,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Watching that on, what was it, Lifetime?

1045
01:16:38,783 --> 01:16:39,684
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, Press Your Luck.

1046
01:16:39,744 --> 01:16:41,225
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a Press Your Luck game on Wii.

1047
01:16:41,285 --> 01:16:43,066
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think there's another one coming out this year, too.

1048
01:16:43,166 --> 01:16:45,308
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's Press Your Luck, A Price is Right.

1049
01:16:45,328 --> 01:16:47,749
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a new Wheel of Fortune game, New Jeopardy.

1050
01:16:48,090 --> 01:16:53,213
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of those games, a lot of those game shows are actually out.

1051
01:16:53,653 --> 01:17:02,899
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how good they are, but I seem to remember X-Link called into the show some time ago, and he's told me about it since then, that the Press Your Luck game is surprisingly not bad.

1052
01:17:03,180 --> 01:17:03,400
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean,

1053
01:17:04,221 --> 01:17:05,962
[SPEAKER_04]: You get what you pay for, right?

1054
01:17:06,122 --> 01:17:09,446
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, if you buy a Press Your Luck game, you know exactly what game you're buying.

1055
01:17:10,286 --> 01:17:11,568
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a big surprise.

1056
01:17:12,008 --> 01:17:13,950
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's just, you know, is it responsive?

1057
01:17:15,071 --> 01:17:17,653
[SPEAKER_04]: Do the questions repeat after playing it three times?

1058
01:17:18,815 --> 01:17:20,136
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all you really need, right?

1059
01:17:21,117 --> 01:17:23,099
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what you're buying when you buy the Press Your Luck home game.

1060
01:17:23,599 --> 01:17:25,260
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's get to the Japanese release dates.

1061
01:17:25,300 --> 01:17:26,101
[SPEAKER_04]: Enough about game shows.

1062
01:17:26,301 --> 01:17:27,542
[SPEAKER_04]: I could talk all day about game shows.

1063
01:17:27,582 --> 01:17:28,162
[SPEAKER_04]: I love game shows.

1064
01:17:28,582 --> 01:17:34,986
[SPEAKER_04]: But let me get to some, in fact, I would love to see the Sherry Shepard version of the newlywed game because you know she's going to make a great host, I think.

1065
01:17:35,006 --> 01:17:37,528
[SPEAKER_14]: I was going to comment about the American Next Top Model game.

1066
01:17:37,988 --> 01:17:42,171
[SPEAKER_14]: Didn't sell well because no matter what you did, Tyra got a better score than you and then she yelled at you.

1067
01:17:43,752 --> 01:17:45,013
[SPEAKER_14]: So that didn't sell well.

1068
01:17:49,272 --> 01:17:50,293
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's a question, though.

1069
01:17:50,813 --> 01:17:54,395
[SPEAKER_02]: What would happen if you had Tyra play the America's Top Model game?

1070
01:17:54,795 --> 01:17:58,958
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, would it go into an infinite loop like, you know, the Tic-Tac-Toe game in War Games?

1071
01:17:58,998 --> 01:17:59,678
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, would it do that?

1072
01:17:59,718 --> 01:18:04,901
[SPEAKER_04]: If she still had her show, she would have used this opportunity to see, now me, and here's my game.

1073
01:18:05,221 --> 01:18:06,662
[SPEAKER_04]: I had so much fun recording this.

1074
01:18:06,722 --> 01:18:10,424
[SPEAKER_04]: I had so much fun doing my game because, you know, the Tyra show really was the Tyra show.

1075
01:18:10,465 --> 01:18:11,065
[SPEAKER_04]: It was about Tyra.

1076
01:18:11,465 --> 01:18:21,613
[SPEAKER_04]: Like she could have on these like starving, she'd be doing a whole show on anorexia and bulimia and one time she'd be like, I just, I remember this one time when I was at a restaurant and I didn't want to eat what was in front of me and I found that to be so hard.

1077
01:18:21,833 --> 01:18:27,418
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I cried that I had the salad and it was very devastating to me emotionally.

1078
01:18:30,416 --> 01:18:30,636
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1079
01:18:32,637 --> 01:18:34,417
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to Japanese release dates.

1080
01:18:35,537 --> 01:18:39,358
[SPEAKER_04]: Kane and Lynch 2 Dog Days comes out on the 26th on the Xbox 360.

1081
01:18:39,418 --> 01:18:40,938
[SPEAKER_04]: Hip hip hooray.

1082
01:18:41,699 --> 01:18:46,220
[SPEAKER_04]: That is a Japanese release, so I don't know if they fully localized it or what, but that is coming out.

1083
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:48,680
[SPEAKER_04]: They're actually played by dogs now.

1084
01:18:50,020 --> 01:18:51,001
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that I buy.

1085
01:18:54,983 --> 01:18:57,606
[SPEAKER_04]: That would make the Kane and Lynch series like ten times better.

1086
01:18:58,587 --> 01:18:59,528
[SPEAKER_04]: If it was like a buddy dog movie.

1087
01:18:59,568 --> 01:19:03,673
[SPEAKER_02]: A gritty crime drama with canines, dogs, you know.

1088
01:19:05,114 --> 01:19:07,097
[SPEAKER_14]: Hold down R2 to scoot your butt, you know.

1089
01:19:13,522 --> 01:19:41,884
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, on the Playstation 3, Kane and Lynch 2 Dog Day is also coming out over there No word if you can, you know, press R3 to poop Agarest Senkei Zero, Compile Heart Selection comes out as well I don't know if this is, I'm imagining it's some type of compilation It's the record of the Agarest Wars, I believe Or at least maybe a sequel to it, the one where you can breed It is a prelude to Agarest Zenki, so it is actually a prequel Okay, so it's a prequel to the breeding game Yes, so there you go You have to breed to create the new game, yeah

1090
01:19:42,584 --> 01:19:44,525
[SPEAKER_04]: That has something in common with the dog game then.

1091
01:19:46,226 --> 01:19:52,008
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, moving to... Man, Nintendogs would be so much cooler if they gave the dogs guns.

1092
01:19:53,189 --> 01:19:53,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't you think?

1093
01:19:54,149 --> 01:19:55,730
[SPEAKER_02]: Would they have a game like that?

1094
01:19:55,830 --> 01:19:56,711
[SPEAKER_02]: I forget.

1095
01:19:58,351 --> 01:20:00,472
[SPEAKER_02]: This got brought up at my work the other day too.

1096
01:20:00,732 --> 01:20:03,194
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone said, it would be even cooler if dogs had guns on their back.

1097
01:20:03,654 --> 01:20:04,994
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but they've done that.

1098
01:20:05,375 --> 01:20:06,275
[SPEAKER_02]: It's metal...

1099
01:20:08,616 --> 01:20:32,757
[SPEAKER_04]: Metal Max or something is what it's called like Metal Saga was what it came out over here and they have like you know literally dogs with artillery cannons on their back like ridiculous stuff it's awesome coming out on the Wii in Japan oh I talked about this last week but this is the week it's coming out on the 26th Twinkle Queen comes out on the Nintendo Wii what kind of game do you think Twinkle Queen is Alan?

1100
01:20:33,037 --> 01:20:34,919
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know but I'm still waiting for my royalty check

1101
01:20:37,536 --> 01:20:39,338
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's Twinkle Starsprites.

1102
01:21:01,599 --> 01:21:03,281
[SPEAKER_02]: So is Carmen Sandiego coming back?

1103
01:21:03,441 --> 01:21:05,182
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it's those type of PC games.

1104
01:21:05,423 --> 01:21:08,645
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think of laid back and tea drinker as the same.

1105
01:21:08,685 --> 01:21:15,612
[SPEAKER_10]: I think of, you know, tight assed and, you know, ramrod straight back tea drinker being proper.

1106
01:21:16,297 --> 01:21:21,040
[SPEAKER_04]: Character themes and other background music will be imported from the originals and rearranged for Twinkle Queen.

1107
01:21:21,460 --> 01:21:25,023
[SPEAKER_04]: A maximum of four players can play the game at a time.

1108
01:21:25,303 --> 01:21:25,683
[SPEAKER_04]: So I love it.

1109
01:21:25,703 --> 01:21:27,685
[SPEAKER_04]: It's PC games, but it's coming out on the Wii.

1110
01:21:28,005 --> 01:21:28,525
[SPEAKER_04]: So go figure.

1111
01:21:28,545 --> 01:21:33,809
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking at the screenshots and I don't see Carmen Sandiego, but I do see a lot of scantily clad women.

1112
01:21:33,949 --> 01:21:35,510
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's Katamari Damacy.

1113
01:21:35,550 --> 01:21:36,851
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the queen from Katamari Damacy.

1114
01:21:37,271 --> 01:21:37,651
[SPEAKER_04]: She's there.

1115
01:21:38,652 --> 01:21:41,034
[SPEAKER_10]: I think you'd be laid back if your tea was laced with something.

1116
01:21:41,274 --> 01:21:42,715
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't that the queen from Katamari Damacy?

1117
01:21:42,975 --> 01:21:43,595
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it is.

1118
01:21:44,316 --> 01:21:45,456
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this a Romco Bandai game?

1119
01:21:45,697 --> 01:21:45,937
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it?

1120
01:21:46,737 --> 01:21:47,718
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's from Milestone.

1121
01:21:48,239 --> 01:21:50,240
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe they licensed it or something.

1122
01:21:50,541 --> 01:21:52,442
[SPEAKER_04]: I swear that looks like the queen from Katamari no Ashi.

1123
01:21:53,543 --> 01:21:54,424
[SPEAKER_08]: No, she's wearing a kimono.

1124
01:21:55,525 --> 01:21:56,626
[SPEAKER_04]: So was it a fighting game?

1125
01:21:56,786 --> 01:21:58,227
[SPEAKER_08]: It's probably something behind her head.

1126
01:21:58,607 --> 01:21:59,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

1127
01:22:00,109 --> 01:22:00,649
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not her.

1128
01:22:01,590 --> 01:22:01,930
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well.

1129
01:22:02,631 --> 01:22:03,031
[SPEAKER_08]: That picture.

1130
01:22:03,291 --> 01:22:04,512
[SPEAKER_04]: Chicks beating each other up.

1131
01:22:04,572 --> 01:22:07,535
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you know, we haven't seen that before.

1132
01:22:08,035 --> 01:22:08,856
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, actually we have.

1133
01:22:10,618 --> 01:22:11,639
[SPEAKER_04]: Nah, it's a joke.

1134
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:14,721
[SPEAKER_04]: You've seen it tons of times, that's why I'm joking.

1135
01:22:15,222 --> 01:22:17,023
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anyhow, moving on to the handhelds.

1136
01:22:19,445 --> 01:22:21,327
[SPEAKER_04]: There's nothing on PlayStation 2, just so you know.

1137
01:22:22,307 --> 01:22:32,295
[SPEAKER_04]: On the Sony PSP, Ace Combat Joint Assault, Hakioki Zusoruku Portable comes out this week from Idea Factory.

1138
01:22:32,495 --> 01:22:33,736
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what this game is.

1139
01:22:33,817 --> 01:22:37,880
[SPEAKER_04]: This is an adventure game that...

1140
01:22:41,363 --> 01:22:42,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Mon Huniki, Poka Poka, Ailu Mura Poka Poka

1141
01:23:05,848 --> 01:23:07,269
[SPEAKER_04]: That's coming out from Capcom.

1142
01:23:07,869 --> 01:23:10,970
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to see what game it is, if it's something we would know here.

1143
01:23:10,990 --> 01:23:13,330
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys recognize this game?

1144
01:23:15,871 --> 01:23:17,792
[SPEAKER_04]: They look like the characters from Animal Crossing, don't they?

1145
01:23:17,852 --> 01:23:18,592
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on, hold on.

1146
01:23:18,632 --> 01:23:20,512
[SPEAKER_04]: This is like a PSP version of Animal Crossing.

1147
01:23:21,473 --> 01:23:22,093
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it's not.

1148
01:23:22,193 --> 01:23:26,234
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the little, I think, ASCII cat people.

1149
01:23:26,914 --> 01:23:29,155
[SPEAKER_14]: They kind of look like Doraemon, a little bit.

1150
01:23:29,395 --> 01:23:29,935
[SPEAKER_14]: A little bit.

1151
01:23:29,995 --> 01:23:31,015
[SPEAKER_10]: But no, they have ears.

1152
01:23:31,035 --> 01:23:31,856
[SPEAKER_14]: Interesting.

1153
01:23:32,896 --> 01:23:33,256
[SPEAKER_14]: Interesting.

1154
01:23:35,653 --> 01:23:53,279
[SPEAKER_04]: quickly on the DS sorry I'm taking a long time here I want to get through this quickly on the Nintendo DS nothing really notable that comes out this week unfortunately so just want to make sure I got them all so there you go those are your Japanese release dates let's go to jolly old England and talk about their releases DarkSakura

[SPEAKER_10]: Well, on the 24th, we have Grease for Wii and DS.

[SPEAKER_10]: We also have Ivy the Kiwi.

1158
01:24:06,995 --> 01:24:09,937
[SPEAKER_10]: It's got a question mark at the end, so it's Ivy the Kiwi?

1159
01:24:10,998 --> 01:24:11,578
[SPEAKER_04]: What's going on here?

1160
01:24:14,071 --> 01:24:15,532
[SPEAKER_04]: You have cut out yet again.

1161
01:24:15,692 --> 01:24:16,173
[SPEAKER_04]: Jeez!

1162
01:24:16,313 --> 01:24:17,214
[SPEAKER_04]: Live radio, folks.

[SPEAKER_10]: We have Ivy the Kiwi.

1164
01:24:19,415 --> 01:24:19,856
[SPEAKER_10]: Kiwi.

[SPEAKER_10]: And on the 25th, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World.

[SPEAKER_10]: And Shank again on Xbox 360.

1168
01:24:27,561 --> 01:24:31,625
[SPEAKER_10]: On the 27th, Mafia 2 for PC, PS3, and 360.

1169
01:24:34,106 --> 01:24:34,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1170
01:24:34,647 --> 01:24:35,007
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it.

1171
01:24:36,528 --> 01:24:39,611
[SPEAKER_04]: A few more news stories for you guys in the classic game of the week.

1172
01:24:40,772 --> 01:24:52,180
[SPEAKER_02]: Sony has been ordered to pay 5 million yen to a former Sony employee who is named Hiro Kume.

1173
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:59,625
[SPEAKER_02]: And he invented, I guess, a small optical pickup that was used to read and write discs in the PlayStation 2 and the original PlayStation.

1174
01:25:00,445 --> 01:25:26,717
[SPEAKER_02]: of course he felt that Sony didn't recognize his contributions and he took them to court and he won so that's not bad and it roughly translates to about $60,000 is what he won and he says I thank the court for identifying some of my contributions to the company but the company should have appreciated my contributions when I was an employee

1175
01:25:29,311 --> 01:25:30,771
[SPEAKER_04]: Ouch, scathing a little bit.

1176
01:25:32,364 --> 01:25:39,469
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of lawsuits, this guy, Craig Smallwood apparently is his name, sued the makers of Lineage.

1177
01:25:39,889 --> 01:25:45,913
[SPEAKER_04]: He wants basically them to fess up to the fact that their game is too damn addicting, in so many words.

1178
01:25:46,513 --> 01:25:57,140
[SPEAKER_04]: He says that Lineage 2 specifically is so addicting that he is, quote, unable to function independently in usual daily activities such as getting up, getting undressed, bathing, or communicating with family and friends.

1179
01:25:57,581 --> 01:25:59,242
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently he played the game for 20,000 hours.

1180
01:26:01,423 --> 01:26:29,789
[SPEAKER_04]: between 2004 and 2009 that's like literally half of every single day playing Lineage 2 hmm apparently it's negligence and gross negligence there we know it's interesting Bobby was talking about this story on his show too and he found through some other resources I guess that the guy was actually running a gold farming service in this game and that's because you'll notice it says he played for 20,000 hours between 2004 and 2009 doesn't really point out why he stopped

1181
01:26:30,869 --> 01:26:34,211
[SPEAKER_04]: So is he really addicted to the game, or is he just a jilted gold farmer?

1182
01:26:34,411 --> 01:26:34,771
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1183
01:26:35,192 --> 01:26:48,119
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it seems like a combination of, I don't know, OCD that could be a legitimate situation that he was in, but also he had, I guess from when we were listening to Bobby Blackwolf's show, he had three accounts that he was using to gold farm.

1184
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:52,302
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe he realized that his return on investment was so much better the more

1185
01:26:52,922 --> 01:26:55,024
[SPEAKER_14]: I have to play 12 hours a day because then I'll make $100 this week.

1186
01:26:55,104 --> 01:26:55,565
[SPEAKER_14]: That could be it.

1187
01:26:55,585 --> 01:26:58,828
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's just assume that wasn't even all a factor.

1188
01:27:10,100 --> 01:27:19,690
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's just assume that's off the table for a minute here We're just talking about somebody suing the makers of the game they've become addicted to because their game is too addicting I mean, really?

1189
01:27:20,090 --> 01:27:23,914
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that mean I can sue McDonald's because I'm addicted to Chicken McNuggets and they made me fat?

1190
01:27:24,275 --> 01:27:25,776
[SPEAKER_09]: They've tried, people have tried Really?

1191
01:27:26,597 --> 01:27:27,158
[SPEAKER_04]: What a country

1192
01:27:27,719 --> 01:27:28,700
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, it's ridiculous.

1193
01:27:29,181 --> 01:27:32,524
[SPEAKER_10]: The whole thing is coming down to lack of self-control.

1194
01:27:34,125 --> 01:27:35,367
[SPEAKER_10]: I love Star Trek Online.

1195
01:27:35,567 --> 01:27:36,928
[SPEAKER_10]: You know how much I love the damn game.

1196
01:27:37,429 --> 01:27:40,212
[SPEAKER_10]: Guess who doesn't stay logged into it for more than two hours at a time?

1197
01:27:40,612 --> 01:27:41,192
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be me.

1198
01:27:42,394 --> 01:27:45,377
[SPEAKER_10]: Even if my friends in the UK are on, I log off.

1199
01:27:46,378 --> 01:27:47,499
[SPEAKER_10]: As much as I love talking to them.

1200
01:27:48,584 --> 01:27:56,493
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, when I was playing Ragnarok, maybe I would leave it on to vend, but I would walk away from my computer.

1201
01:27:57,133 --> 01:27:59,896
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, it's addiction.

1202
01:28:00,297 --> 01:28:01,558
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, not really addiction.

1203
01:28:02,119 --> 01:28:02,659
[SPEAKER_10]: There's no...

1204
01:28:04,033 --> 01:28:14,719
[SPEAKER_10]: Now the only thing that I could remotely say that this has any kind of physical effect is, this is getting into a little bit of chemical psychology, is what stimulates the pleasure centers of the brain.

1205
01:28:15,679 --> 01:28:17,220
[SPEAKER_10]: And that does become addicting.

1206
01:28:17,901 --> 01:28:23,323
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, for example, love has the same effect in the brain that cocaine can.

1207
01:28:24,284 --> 01:28:25,344
[SPEAKER_10]: You know.

1208
01:28:25,865 --> 01:28:30,267
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's the only way I can see any kind of addiction possibly forming.

1209
01:28:31,108 --> 01:28:33,509
[SPEAKER_10]: But that's where the self-control comes in.

1210
01:28:35,347 --> 01:28:39,389
[SPEAKER_10]: It may be hard, but you have to take some time for yourself.

1211
01:28:39,509 --> 01:28:40,469
[SPEAKER_10]: Get away from the game.

1212
01:28:41,490 --> 01:28:43,211
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what Lineage 2 has in place.

1213
01:28:43,251 --> 01:28:44,251
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a game I've played.

1214
01:28:44,291 --> 01:28:45,272
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it's as popular.

1215
01:28:45,332 --> 01:28:49,273
[SPEAKER_10]: I played it at E3 a few years ago and have a can of Coke in my vault.

1216
01:28:50,214 --> 01:28:52,255
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, was that the game that gave away the soda?

1217
01:28:52,335 --> 01:28:52,615
[SPEAKER_10]: Hold on.

1218
01:28:52,935 --> 01:28:54,116
[SPEAKER_04]: This was years ago.

1219
01:28:55,716 --> 01:28:56,457
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I remember it now.

1220
01:28:56,477 --> 01:28:57,237
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't a bad game.

1221
01:28:57,257 --> 01:28:58,137
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't.

1222
01:28:59,758 --> 01:29:02,060
[SPEAKER_04]: It's way more popular in Asia than it is here.

1223
01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:06,845
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, when I say way more popular, I mean like, you know, WoW is the US game, obviously.

1224
01:29:06,925 --> 01:29:10,568
[SPEAKER_04]: Lineage and Lineage 2 are like twice that, what it is here.

1225
01:29:11,569 --> 01:29:16,333
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I recognize the art style on this can, the character creation, yeah.

1226
01:29:16,863 --> 01:29:18,525
[SPEAKER_04]: But Lineage is a huge game over there.

1227
01:29:18,545 --> 01:29:21,127
[SPEAKER_04]: And obviously, I believe this gentleman lives in Hawaii.

1228
01:29:21,667 --> 01:29:25,591
[SPEAKER_04]: So Hawaii kind of gets a little bit of a blending of both cultures a lot of times.

1229
01:29:26,992 --> 01:29:29,314
[SPEAKER_04]: So Lineage probably has a pretty good fan base there.

1230
01:29:29,334 --> 01:29:32,417
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, certainly has its players here in the continental US too.

1231
01:29:32,477 --> 01:29:34,099
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't know.

1232
01:29:34,139 --> 01:29:34,399
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just...

1233
01:29:36,460 --> 01:29:48,933
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of other games I've played, like WoW, you know, and, you know, I joke that I'm addicted to WoW, but at the end of the day, like, for instance, Alan and I went to Reno this weekend, and we walked away, and believe it or not, we're okay.

1234
01:29:49,333 --> 01:29:51,235
[SPEAKER_04]: We're gonna run our daily the minute we get home.

1235
01:29:52,436 --> 01:30:09,043
[SPEAKER_14]: There have been times in WoW where it's like, you know, maybe midnight, 1am, I've done my daily and my daily rep whatever BS, and I'm not tired yet, but I'm just on my mount doing laps around Dalaran, and I'm not really playing.

1236
01:30:09,163 --> 01:30:10,824
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm like, what am I doing right now?

1237
01:30:11,244 --> 01:30:12,084
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm in WoW.

1238
01:30:12,684 --> 01:30:13,485
[SPEAKER_14]: I have nothing to do.

1239
01:30:13,825 --> 01:30:14,765
[SPEAKER_14]: I should just log off.

1240
01:30:14,965 --> 01:30:19,487
[SPEAKER_14]: And I've had moments where I just have to make myself sign off because I'm not playing.

1241
01:30:19,507 --> 01:30:21,688
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I've done that, but it's because I'm chatting with people.

1242
01:30:22,208 --> 01:30:24,671
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll be running laps in Dalaran, but I'm also chatting.

1243
01:30:24,752 --> 01:30:28,516
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I'll be reading trade or whatever, but it's like, yeah.

1244
01:30:28,697 --> 01:30:31,721
[SPEAKER_04]: There's nothing morally redeeming about trade chat.

1245
01:30:31,841 --> 01:30:33,703
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it's like 4chan, but in WoW.

1246
01:30:34,464 --> 01:30:34,845
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty much.

1247
01:30:36,204 --> 01:30:43,370
[SPEAKER_04]: But WoW, when you log in... Well, I don't remember if WoW has it when you log in, but at least I know some of the tip screens say... Loading screen, yeah.

1248
01:30:43,390 --> 01:30:47,233
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the loading screens will say, remember to take everything in moderation, including Warcraft.

1249
01:30:47,513 --> 01:30:48,234
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember that.

1250
01:30:48,314 --> 01:30:50,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Final Fantasy XI had a disclaimer.

1251
01:30:50,776 --> 01:30:52,418
[SPEAKER_04]: You had to click every time.

1252
01:30:52,818 --> 01:30:54,560
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't forget your friends, family, or work.

1253
01:30:54,620 --> 01:30:55,701
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, this whole little spiel.

1254
01:30:55,741 --> 01:30:56,561
[SPEAKER_14]: Every two or three hours?

1255
01:30:56,822 --> 01:30:58,864
[SPEAKER_04]: No, every time you logged into the game, you had to click it.

1256
01:30:59,324 --> 01:31:00,185
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I remember that.

1257
01:31:01,065 --> 01:31:01,586
[SPEAKER_10]: But, I mean...

1258
01:31:03,247 --> 01:31:05,248
[SPEAKER_10]: It really does come back.

1259
01:31:05,468 --> 01:31:10,070
[SPEAKER_10]: I can be on AIM and get caught up in a conversation with somebody.

1260
01:31:10,130 --> 01:31:11,650
[SPEAKER_10]: That's one thing.

1261
01:31:11,750 --> 01:31:16,732
[SPEAKER_10]: I could be online reading news articles and get caught up in reading.

1262
01:31:16,792 --> 01:31:18,753
[SPEAKER_10]: Or I do it with Wikipedia all the damn time.

1263
01:31:19,513 --> 01:31:24,535
[SPEAKER_10]: But the whole thing is to catch yourself, to make reminders.

1264
01:31:25,535 --> 01:31:26,876
[SPEAKER_10]: When you notice the time...

1265
01:31:28,920 --> 01:31:31,441
[SPEAKER_10]: Then, oh crap, I've gone on too long.

1266
01:31:31,641 --> 01:31:33,001
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I'll have to check this later.

1267
01:31:33,241 --> 01:31:41,384
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I don't really think, I think that maybe going like an hour or two over when you decided, you know, that you wanted to stop.

1268
01:31:42,345 --> 01:31:43,765
[SPEAKER_10]: That's kind of understandable.

1269
01:31:44,265 --> 01:31:52,528
[SPEAKER_10]: Getting caught up is human nature, but to make a habit of it and to play to the exclusion of all else, that's when it gets unhealthy.

1270
01:31:55,908 --> 01:32:02,934
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, again, I don't know if he's going to be very successful suing the makers of the game because he couldn't control himself.

1271
01:32:03,194 --> 01:32:05,376
[SPEAKER_04]: I just think it would set a horrific precedence.

1272
01:32:06,317 --> 01:32:08,679
[SPEAKER_04]: We could sue anything that had a negative effect on us.

1273
01:32:10,721 --> 01:32:12,042
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to have some self-control.

1274
01:32:13,123 --> 01:32:18,407
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just kind of sad that the judge wouldn't throw it out, but nope, the judge actually is allowing the case to proceed.

1275
01:32:19,528 --> 01:32:20,549
[SPEAKER_04]: That should be interesting.

1276
01:32:21,169 --> 01:32:24,112
[SPEAKER_09]: You know why I would think it would be a good idea to let a case like that proceed?

1277
01:32:25,480 --> 01:32:26,380
[SPEAKER_04]: So he's struck down.

1278
01:32:26,560 --> 01:32:27,601
[SPEAKER_10]: Setting legal precedence.

1279
01:32:28,342 --> 01:32:28,802
[SPEAKER_04]: I can see that.

1280
01:32:30,303 --> 01:32:30,663
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

1281
01:32:30,744 --> 01:32:36,568
[SPEAKER_04]: Xenocor in our chatroom at chat.orange.radio.com says, Lineage 2 is an Unreal Engine converted grinding piece of shit.

1282
01:32:36,668 --> 01:32:37,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Or POS.

1283
01:32:37,348 --> 01:32:38,569
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm assuming meaning piece of shit.

1284
01:32:39,290 --> 01:32:42,472
[SPEAKER_04]: TigerClaw says, You know, StarCraft 2 can be quite addicting.

1285
01:32:42,512 --> 01:32:46,455
[SPEAKER_04]: The other night I was playing it late at night and by the time I stopped it was like 5am in the morning.

1286
01:32:46,995 --> 01:32:48,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, a lot of video games.

1287
01:32:48,116 --> 01:32:50,178
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, StarCraft I've heard of tons of addictions.

1288
01:32:50,198 --> 01:32:50,498
[SPEAKER_04]: Well,

1289
01:32:50,618 --> 01:33:18,451
[SPEAKER_10]: you know addictions of varying degrees stories of that but there's I'm sure there's lots of video games even Jamie has talked about when you were in high school or college you stayed out for a week to play Final Fantasy 6 granted I did have the flu legitimately but all I did was play Final Fantasy it was Final Fantasy 3 6 over in Japan that's the only game I've ever you know played while I was that sick

1290
01:33:19,791 --> 01:33:22,435
[SPEAKER_10]: I played a lot of Final Fantasy 7 when I was supposed to be in college.

1291
01:33:37,924 --> 01:33:41,687
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd skip class from time to time to watch Sailor Moon or play Toshinden.

1292
01:33:42,668 --> 01:33:48,954
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, and when my friend had his, he had a Saturn before everybody else because he imported it.

1293
01:33:49,694 --> 01:33:53,938
[SPEAKER_10]: And I stayed up all night playing the damn Gundam game and King of Fighters.

1294
01:33:55,679 --> 01:33:58,782
[SPEAKER_10]: But that's one time, you know.

1295
01:33:59,249 --> 01:34:01,672
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, what should the kids be worshipping this week?

1296
01:34:20,473 --> 01:34:21,874
[SPEAKER_10]: The game is called Recca.

1297
01:34:23,674 --> 01:34:26,295
[SPEAKER_10]: And this game was made for the Summer Carnival in 1992.

1298
01:34:26,395 --> 01:34:33,558
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a very limited printing of it, but it's amazing for a NES game.

1299
01:34:34,139 --> 01:34:34,959
[SPEAKER_10]: This is some music.

1300
01:34:44,943 --> 01:34:48,144
[SPEAKER_10]: So you see, it's got a pretty rad soundtrack for a NES game.

1301
01:34:48,644 --> 01:34:49,485
[SPEAKER_04]: All I hear are the bullets.

1302
01:34:50,973 --> 01:34:52,495
[SPEAKER_10]: I've got the soundtrack to this.

1303
01:34:52,995 --> 01:35:03,125
[SPEAKER_10]: But now, the game itself is probably one of the, I would say, earlier games that could be considered bullet hell.

1304
01:35:03,886 --> 01:35:04,927
[SPEAKER_10]: Really, I think it could be.

1305
01:35:04,947 --> 01:35:09,972
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, you see who in the chatroom got freaking excited was one of our bullet hell fans.

1306
01:35:11,514 --> 01:35:11,574
[SPEAKER_10]: Um...

1307
01:35:13,769 --> 01:35:17,511
[SPEAKER_10]: But RECCA is pretty damn hardcore.

1308
01:35:17,551 --> 01:35:18,872
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, we've got ROMs of it.

1309
01:35:18,892 --> 01:35:22,954
[SPEAKER_10]: You can actually buy... Let me get the site again.

1310
01:35:23,014 --> 01:35:32,158
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it was reccanes.net You can buy reproduction cartridges to play on US systems.

1311
01:35:32,918 --> 01:35:33,659
[SPEAKER_10]: Which is pretty cool.

1312
01:35:34,759 --> 01:35:41,963
[SPEAKER_10]: But the game, what makes it really special is that it is one of the...

1313
01:35:44,108 --> 01:35:45,809
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1314
01:36:08,401 --> 01:36:09,342
[SPEAKER_14]: It looks really amazing.

1315
01:36:09,382 --> 01:36:13,324
[SPEAKER_14]: The framerate for a NES game, even on the YouTube, it's blazing fast.

1316
01:36:13,384 --> 01:36:14,445
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm really impressed by this.

1317
01:36:14,525 --> 01:36:17,427
[SPEAKER_10]: It really does play that fast.

1318
01:36:19,228 --> 01:36:29,555
[SPEAKER_10]: The game itself was published by Naxxast Soft, that's N-A-X-A-T, in 1992, like I said, for the Summer Carnival.

1319
01:36:30,715 --> 01:36:32,176
[SPEAKER_10]: It is a side-scroller.

1320
01:36:32,196 --> 01:36:32,356
[SPEAKER_10]: It has...

1321
01:36:35,778 --> 01:36:36,559
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and, um...

1322
01:37:01,914 --> 01:37:04,335
[SPEAKER_10]: And the soundtrack for it is freaking amazing.

1323
01:37:06,016 --> 01:37:17,941
[SPEAKER_10]: The other things that you have with this, too, is that instead of having bombs, that when you stop shooting, you can build up a power surge and deflect incoming fire.

1324
01:37:18,581 --> 01:37:23,343
[SPEAKER_10]: And then if you charge a long time, then it'll clear the screen the way a bomb would do.

1325
01:37:27,247 --> 01:37:30,489
[SPEAKER_10]: It's really hard to do that, though, because you can see how fast the enemies come at you.

1326
01:37:31,049 --> 01:37:33,170
[SPEAKER_10]: And look at the effects in the background.

1327
01:37:33,230 --> 01:37:37,353
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, that's very, you know, looks almost Mode 7-ish, I should say.

1328
01:37:38,413 --> 01:37:40,714
[SPEAKER_10]: And this was before there was such a thing as Mode 7.

1329
01:37:41,855 --> 01:37:45,057
[SPEAKER_10]: It has a normal score attack and time attack.

1330
01:37:45,197 --> 01:37:46,557
[SPEAKER_10]: It's single player only.

1331
01:37:47,498 --> 01:37:47,598
[SPEAKER_10]: Um...

1332
01:37:49,438 --> 01:37:50,179
[SPEAKER_10]: The game is cool.

1333
01:37:50,419 --> 01:37:53,821
[SPEAKER_10]: You've got five primary weapons and then five optional weapons.

1334
01:37:54,702 --> 01:37:57,543
[SPEAKER_10]: So you get different power-ups and you can shoot different ways.

1335
01:37:57,703 --> 01:38:00,265
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just really, really amazing.

1336
01:38:00,806 --> 01:38:05,929
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's the typical story, you have to fight off the aliens, blah blah, save the Earth.

1337
01:38:07,456 --> 01:38:14,123
[SPEAKER_10]: and I think that Rekka is just a freaking cool name for a game that needs a blazing fire.

1338
01:38:15,144 --> 01:38:19,148
[SPEAKER_10]: But the official name is Legend Consumer Series Summer Carnival 92 Rekka.

1339
01:38:23,189 --> 01:38:24,950
[SPEAKER_10]: and good luck freaking finding it.

1340
01:38:25,291 --> 01:38:28,895
[SPEAKER_04]: I just even love that idea of flying up the tunnel and then flying back down.

1341
01:38:28,935 --> 01:38:31,918
[SPEAKER_04]: You just don't see that in a lot of shooters, at least that I can think of.

1342
01:38:33,359 --> 01:38:37,704
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, shooters are almost always ship is on the bottom and you're moving your way up.

1343
01:38:38,284 --> 01:38:40,106
[SPEAKER_04]: Or you're fully side.

1344
01:38:40,166 --> 01:38:45,412
[SPEAKER_04]: You rarely ever see it the other way around where you're flying at the top of the screen and you're moving down.

1345
01:38:45,632 --> 01:38:53,816
[SPEAKER_10]: You know the only other game that I've seen some kind of innovation for the standard side-scrolling shooter was that same Gundam game that was on the Saturn back in the day when it came out.

1346
01:38:54,237 --> 01:38:56,418
[SPEAKER_10]: Because you had three planes.

1347
01:38:57,638 --> 01:39:01,400
[SPEAKER_10]: You were in the middle ground, but you had foreground and background enemies to fight too.

1348
01:39:01,420 --> 01:39:03,722
[SPEAKER_10]: And now this here is stationary.

1349
01:39:04,742 --> 01:39:08,184
[SPEAKER_04]: Not just that as a non-standard shooter, but I always think of, of course, this game.

1350
01:39:08,204 --> 01:39:10,085
[SPEAKER_04]: We never talk enough about it here on Orange Lines Radio.

1351
01:39:10,445 --> 01:39:16,888
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the most underrated NES games they ever made, The Guardian Legend, was half shooter and a decent shooter at that, and then half Zelda-ish game.

1352
01:39:17,208 --> 01:39:22,070
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, if we do end up doing our little Labor Day marathon, I think we should just play the shit out of that game and beat it.

1353
01:39:22,190 --> 01:39:23,070
[SPEAKER_10]: Dude, I'm all for it.

1354
01:39:23,210 --> 01:39:24,271
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm all for it.

1355
01:39:26,132 --> 01:39:28,913
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, see that right there, though, is an example of the charging move.

1356
01:39:31,718 --> 01:39:32,819
[SPEAKER_04]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1357
01:40:02,785 --> 01:40:07,487
[SPEAKER_04]: Hitstun in our chatroom is saying that Legend Consumer Series only applies to the soundtrack.

1358
01:40:07,547 --> 01:40:09,388
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just Summer Carnival 92, Rekka.

1359
01:40:12,550 --> 01:40:12,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Cut out.

1360
01:40:13,690 --> 01:40:13,931
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1361
01:40:16,092 --> 01:40:17,532
[SPEAKER_10]: The soundtrack is worth having.

1362
01:40:19,113 --> 01:40:20,934
[SPEAKER_10]: I found it actually to download somewhere.

1363
01:40:21,795 --> 01:40:24,636
[SPEAKER_10]: So, speaking of the soundtrack, go get it.

1364
01:40:25,716 --> 01:40:26,757
[SPEAKER_10]: The music is really sweet.

1365
01:40:27,446 --> 01:40:34,956
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week, Rekka, or if you want Summer Carnival 92 Rekka, for the Nintendo Entertainment System.

1366
01:40:35,016 --> 01:40:39,622
[SPEAKER_04]: Good luck finding that, although it does sound like you can get the reproduced cartridges, if nothing else.

1367
01:40:40,023 --> 01:40:40,804
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1368
01:40:40,824 --> 01:40:41,425
[SPEAKER_10]: Somebody get me one.

1369
01:40:42,426 --> 01:40:45,267
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to do it for Part A here at Orange Lounge Radio, but we're not done yet.

1370
01:40:45,307 --> 01:40:48,849
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got more news coming up in Part B. We're going to talk a little bit about Rock Band 3.

1371
01:40:49,749 --> 01:40:51,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Talk a little bit about Dance Central, too.

1372
01:40:51,250 --> 01:40:51,990
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of music game news.

1373
01:40:52,010 --> 01:40:54,351
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to talk about a new drawing tablet on the Wii.

1374
01:40:54,911 --> 01:40:56,712
[SPEAKER_04]: Talk, of course, a little bit about Doctor Who.

1375
01:40:57,252 --> 01:40:58,432
[SPEAKER_04]: And more hacking news.

1376
01:40:58,893 --> 01:41:01,874
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, ways to cut the lines at PAX.

1377
01:41:02,594 --> 01:41:04,736
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm very interested to see what the chatters think about this story.

1378
01:41:04,756 --> 01:41:13,064
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to be getting to this, your emails, your Twitter topics, and much more, your phone calls when we come back here at the show where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.

1379
01:41:19,913 --> 01:41:22,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

1380
01:41:22,335 --> 01:41:31,744
[SPEAKER_04]: We are live on this Sunday evening, August the 22nd of 2010, where we are taping live the 378th episode of our show.

1381
01:41:32,625 --> 01:41:34,186
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's been about eight and a half years.

1382
01:41:34,506 --> 01:41:34,947
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you go.

1383
01:41:35,539 --> 01:41:36,519
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

1384
01:41:55,686 --> 01:41:57,468
[SPEAKER_14]: Ticket Spitters, you know, gambling for kids.

1385
01:41:58,048 --> 01:42:05,014
[SPEAKER_14]: I did see a smaller arcade that I never got a chance to actually go into that had a lot of Capcom stuff, like they had MVC2.

1386
01:42:05,054 --> 01:42:07,696
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I remember when we were looking in there, you're like, no, that's my kind of arcade.

1387
01:42:08,357 --> 01:42:10,678
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, well, it's like my, you know, I've got 10 bucks.

1388
01:42:10,819 --> 01:42:14,241
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it going to last longer on slots or on arcade games?

1389
01:42:15,002 --> 01:42:16,043
[SPEAKER_14]: So arcade games won.

1390
01:42:17,614 --> 01:42:19,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Ray Ayanami says we should have gone to Atlantis.

1391
01:42:19,615 --> 01:42:20,355
[SPEAKER_04]: What do they have there?

1392
01:42:20,415 --> 01:42:25,478
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, they probably have really... The problem with a lot of those huge, huge ones, they're not downtown.

1393
01:42:25,578 --> 01:42:30,380
[SPEAKER_04]: So they take, you know... The downtown ones are much easier because they're all kind of in the same city block.

1394
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:31,821
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have to get in the car and go, whatever.

1395
01:42:32,361 --> 01:42:34,442
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else interesting in Reno that you came across?

1396
01:42:36,643 --> 01:42:41,265
[SPEAKER_14]: The fact that it's kind of... I don't want... How can I say this without sounding pretentious?

1397
01:42:41,305 --> 01:42:42,245
[SPEAKER_14]: Just Reno is...

1398
01:42:43,846 --> 01:42:44,886
[SPEAKER_14]: Kind of low budget.

1399
01:42:44,927 --> 01:42:45,927
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, that's kind of the point.

1400
01:42:46,127 --> 01:42:49,908
[SPEAKER_14]: If you can afford to go to Vegas, you just go to Vegas.

1401
01:42:50,109 --> 01:42:51,889
[SPEAKER_14]: So Reno's really kind of watered down.

1402
01:42:52,930 --> 01:43:03,734
[SPEAKER_14]: We had a hilariously awful dining experience there, which I thought was funny, considering it's this amazing sort of, you know, the El Dorado, Silver Legacy, Circus Circus, it's all one big mall.

1403
01:43:03,754 --> 01:43:04,554
[SPEAKER_14]: They're all connected.

1404
01:43:04,594 --> 01:43:05,795
[SPEAKER_14]: You can just stay in that facility.

1405
01:43:06,375 --> 01:43:09,136
[SPEAKER_14]: So it was after Rocky, and it was around 11.30.

1406
01:43:09,796 --> 01:43:11,337
[SPEAKER_14]: We were all starving and exhausted.

1407
01:43:12,097 --> 01:43:19,959
[SPEAKER_14]: So we sat down, took it, not even kidding, not kidding, 30 minutes for her to take our order, another 35 for our food to arrive.

1408
01:43:20,799 --> 01:43:33,902
[SPEAKER_14]: So we were at the table for about an hour before any food showed up, and I had joked that when we got our receipt for the tip section, we should write in the margin, we put your tip in that slot machine and you should go get it.

1409
01:43:35,323 --> 01:43:35,843
[SPEAKER_14]: Very nice.

1410
01:43:37,043 --> 01:43:39,504
[SPEAKER_10]: I've taken something from my best friend.

1411
01:43:40,104 --> 01:43:40,904
[SPEAKER_10]: She leaves two cents.

1412
01:43:42,699 --> 01:43:43,820
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I've done that before.

1413
01:43:43,880 --> 01:43:51,929
[SPEAKER_14]: I once was in, I think it was in Olive Garden, which is why I don't like going there, where the friend and I that I was with, we left like seven cents.

1414
01:43:51,989 --> 01:43:55,593
[SPEAKER_14]: It was a very specific amount of change to where they knew it was deliberate.

1415
01:43:55,993 --> 01:43:58,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, it was hard though in that case.

1416
01:43:58,436 --> 01:44:03,702
[SPEAKER_04]: I really don't like doing that unless it really is clearly this wait person's fault.

1417
01:44:04,022 --> 01:44:04,823
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1418
01:44:24,065 --> 01:44:25,746
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1419
01:44:54,626 --> 01:44:55,646
[SPEAKER_04]: So just bear with us.

1420
01:44:55,666 --> 01:44:57,067
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what happens when you tape a show live.

1421
01:44:57,107 --> 01:44:58,569
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to disconnect right now.

1422
01:45:00,765 --> 01:45:02,726
[SPEAKER_04]: Ha ha, the live listeners can't hear us right now.

1423
01:45:03,586 --> 01:45:05,607
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there any live listeners you want to talk smack about while we're doing this?

1424
01:45:06,008 --> 01:45:07,368
[SPEAKER_10]: Smack, smack, smack, smack.

1425
01:45:07,388 --> 01:45:08,209
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's reconnect.

1426
01:45:09,209 --> 01:45:13,151
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so we're reconnected, so we'll see if that hopefully helps the problem.

1427
01:45:13,692 --> 01:45:19,555
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, but everything otherwise looks good on our end, so it could be on the all games end as well.

1428
01:45:20,215 --> 01:45:21,576
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, so we'll see.

1429
01:45:22,136 --> 01:45:29,580
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, let's move on to some rapid fire news and all the quick little things that, you know, if we had a five hour show we could talk more about.

1430
01:45:29,720 --> 01:45:29,900
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki?

1431
01:45:31,548 --> 01:45:32,148
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's start us off.

1432
01:45:32,929 --> 01:45:33,389
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

1433
01:45:33,509 --> 01:45:35,890
[SPEAKER_02]: So, there's some interesting stuff here.

1434
01:45:36,030 --> 01:45:42,713
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll start with, of course, something from Dragon Quest IX.

1435
01:45:43,154 --> 01:45:45,535
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was something you mentioned, Robin.

1436
01:45:45,575 --> 01:45:47,115
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it was Dragon Quest.

1437
01:45:47,215 --> 01:45:47,696
[SPEAKER_02]: It was...

1438
01:45:50,214 --> 01:45:50,734
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

1439
01:46:10,854 --> 01:46:22,839
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, anyways, apparently Dragon Quest... I guess this is... Yeah, Dragon Quest IX, there's something you can purchase, I guess.

1440
01:46:23,059 --> 01:46:26,420
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Poof Poof, or Puff Puff.

1441
01:46:26,980 --> 01:46:30,022
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess Puff Puff Performance is a quest you can unlock.

1442
01:46:31,102 --> 01:46:47,172
[SPEAKER_02]: and um apparently Puff Puff is uh interesting because obviously this is an E10 game there is no sex involved but uh Puff Puff I guess is coming I read this it's uh

1443
01:46:48,852 --> 01:46:49,112
[SPEAKER_02]: Pafu Pafu

1444
01:47:18,084 --> 01:47:24,347
[SPEAKER_02]: Funny enough, it's not really her breasts rubbing against his face, but it's two slimes against his face, but still.

1445
01:47:25,848 --> 01:47:26,588
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of scandalous.

1446
01:47:26,709 --> 01:47:27,129
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit.

1447
01:47:27,449 --> 01:47:27,829
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit.

1448
01:47:28,309 --> 01:47:29,570
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that really the sound that makes?

1449
01:47:29,790 --> 01:47:30,510
[SPEAKER_04]: Pafu, pafu?

1450
01:47:30,691 --> 01:47:31,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that what they say?

1451
01:47:31,251 --> 01:47:32,131
[SPEAKER_04]: You should ask Victoria.

1452
01:47:33,392 --> 01:47:33,772
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1453
01:47:34,212 --> 01:47:35,513
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie, could you come over here for a minute?

1454
01:47:37,134 --> 01:47:37,474
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

1455
01:47:40,115 --> 01:47:41,296
[SPEAKER_04]: We have an experiment we need to try.

1456
01:47:41,336 --> 01:47:42,717
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, we're going to put the microphone right there.

1457
01:47:46,411 --> 01:47:47,492
[SPEAKER_10]: Very Pufu Pufu like.

1458
01:47:48,773 --> 01:47:49,574
[SPEAKER_10]: Boobs, what do you have to say?

1459
01:47:50,935 --> 01:47:51,676
[SPEAKER_10]: They don't say anything.

1460
01:47:51,836 --> 01:47:52,116
[SPEAKER_10]: I see.

1461
01:47:53,377 --> 01:47:54,418
[SPEAKER_04]: They just sit there and look pretty.

1462
01:47:56,420 --> 01:47:58,181
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently it's in the game and it's funny.

1463
01:47:58,441 --> 01:48:05,307
[SPEAKER_02]: They had a funny video of it as well online and it's very filled with innuendo.

1464
01:48:06,528 --> 01:48:10,412
[SPEAKER_02]: But E10, so it'd be different if it was a mature raid game.

1465
01:48:11,873 --> 01:48:11,933
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

1466
01:48:13,775 --> 01:48:20,138
[SPEAKER_02]: Red Faction Battlegrounds has been announced for Xbox Live Arcade and the PlayStation Network by THQ Digital.

1467
01:48:20,538 --> 01:48:23,799
[SPEAKER_02]: It is going to be a prequel to Red Faction Armageddon.

1468
01:48:24,540 --> 01:48:33,163
[SPEAKER_02]: And if, I should say, if THQ has it their way, they want to put the game out for free or close to free as possible.

1469
01:48:33,503 --> 01:48:39,946
[SPEAKER_02]: Perhaps as a pre-order incentive for ordering Red Faction Armageddon.

1470
01:48:41,437 --> 01:48:43,379
[SPEAKER_02]: So that sounds kind of cool.

1471
01:48:44,661 --> 01:48:47,504
[SPEAKER_02]: And is expected to come out sometime in 2011.

1472
01:48:48,265 --> 01:48:50,848
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably three or four months before the game is released.

1473
01:48:51,168 --> 01:48:53,151
[SPEAKER_02]: Or Red Faction Armageddon is released.

1474
01:48:55,731 --> 01:48:56,491
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's interesting.

1475
01:48:57,191 --> 01:49:08,075
[SPEAKER_02]: And then finally, if you're a fan of music games, and who isn't, there is a brand new browser-based music game you can check out called Instant Jam.

1476
01:49:08,235 --> 01:49:09,915
[SPEAKER_02]: It comes from Instant Action.

1477
01:49:10,735 --> 01:49:14,697
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a game that looks very similar to, say, like a Guitar Hero game.

1478
01:49:16,837 --> 01:49:23,224
[SPEAKER_02]: One of those games where you have the no highway and the different things coming down.

1479
01:49:24,365 --> 01:49:36,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently it supports your own music library and it also supports keyboard or USB guitar controllers and allows for in-game music purchases as well through Amazon or iTunes.

1480
01:49:37,398 --> 01:49:39,220
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it's a version of download content.

1481
01:49:42,756 --> 01:49:51,925
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a beta currently available through Facebook and versions playable through the website and elsewhere will be rolled out soon.

1482
01:49:55,805 --> 01:49:57,786
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's move on with some other stories here.

1483
01:49:58,067 --> 01:49:59,828
[SPEAKER_04]: And I want to talk about Speaking Music Games.

1484
01:49:59,928 --> 01:50:02,930
[SPEAKER_04]: Dance Central has some new songs announced for it.

1485
01:50:03,671 --> 01:50:05,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Ten more songs announced this week.

1486
01:50:06,072 --> 01:50:20,222
[SPEAKER_04]: Nelly Furtado with Maneater, Basement Jax with Rendezvous, Benny Benassi with Satisfaction, Nina Sky with Move Ya Body, Cascada with Evacuate the Dance Floor, Pitbull with I Know You Want Me, Calle Ocho.

1487
01:50:20,543 --> 01:50:21,103
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that that?

1488
01:50:21,543 --> 01:50:22,704
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you want me.

1489
01:50:23,344 --> 01:50:24,365
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I want ya.

1490
01:50:25,946 --> 01:50:27,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds like Strong Bad singing.

1491
01:50:27,707 --> 01:50:31,989
[SPEAKER_04]: Fanny Pack with Hey... Too bad it's not the Fanny Pack song.

1492
01:50:32,369 --> 01:50:33,990
[SPEAKER_04]: Camel Toe, but it's Hey Mami.

1493
01:50:34,170 --> 01:50:34,250
[SPEAKER_04]: Mami?

1494
01:50:34,430 --> 01:50:34,650
[SPEAKER_04]: M-A-M-I.

1495
01:50:34,690 --> 01:50:35,331
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Mami.

1496
01:50:36,251 --> 01:50:36,931
[SPEAKER_04]: Mami?

1497
01:50:37,252 --> 01:50:37,952
[SPEAKER_04]: Mami is M-O-M-M-Y.

1498
01:50:40,939 --> 01:50:42,720
[SPEAKER_10]: Depends on if it's a name.

1499
01:50:42,760 --> 01:50:43,080
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

1500
01:50:43,361 --> 01:50:44,541
[SPEAKER_10]: Or another language.

1501
01:50:44,881 --> 01:50:56,369
[SPEAKER_04]: Rihanna has Ponda Replay, Cool and the Gang, Jungle Boogie, Technotronic with Pump Up the Jam, and Kylie Minogue with Can't Get You Out of My Head.

1502
01:50:57,489 --> 01:50:59,771
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a fun song when it was in DDR like years and years ago.

1503
01:50:59,791 --> 01:51:00,931
[SPEAKER_08]: I likes Kylie.

1504
01:51:00,951 --> 01:51:01,312
[SPEAKER_08]: It's cool.

1505
01:51:01,612 --> 01:51:07,175
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say there was some other songs as well I can confirm that are going to be in the game.

1506
01:51:07,215 --> 01:51:08,076
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, I'm looking...

1507
01:51:08,456 --> 01:51:10,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, is that the whole lyric spill thing that happened?

1508
01:51:11,057 --> 01:51:12,899
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, not even.

1509
01:51:13,459 --> 01:51:14,479
[SPEAKER_02]: More scandalous than that.

1510
01:51:15,800 --> 01:51:20,803
[SPEAKER_02]: No, this is wonderful people that shouldn't be in places that they are.

1511
01:51:20,823 --> 01:51:23,925
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they naughty people that have already gotten copies of the game somehow?

1512
01:51:23,945 --> 01:51:28,247
[SPEAKER_02]: They're naughty people that have gotten copies of the beta that's on PartnerNet.

1513
01:51:28,687 --> 01:51:29,487
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh no!

1514
01:51:29,508 --> 01:51:36,251
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, they can't play anything because it requires a Kinect camera, but it doesn't mean that they won't know what songs are on there.

1515
01:51:37,891 --> 01:51:42,033
[SPEAKER_02]: And included in there, I'm not sure if these have been already announced, Lady Gaga's Poker Face.

1516
01:51:42,073 --> 01:51:43,254
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was in the demo.

1517
01:51:43,294 --> 01:51:52,698
[SPEAKER_02]: Lips Inc., Mouth to Mouth, M.I.A., Arlor, No Doubt, Rocksteady, Bell Biv, The Vogue, Poison, and BC Boy's Body Move in the Fat Boy Slim remix.

1518
01:51:52,898 --> 01:51:56,205
[SPEAKER_04]: A few of those were already out there, but I don't remember the MIA song being announced.

1519
01:51:56,586 --> 01:51:57,688
[SPEAKER_04]: That's news to me.

1520
01:51:58,249 --> 01:51:58,570
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

1521
01:52:01,184 --> 01:52:01,444
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1522
01:52:02,305 --> 01:52:05,948
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we'll see what the song list looks like anyway.

1523
01:52:06,268 --> 01:52:10,191
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure not too much longer we'll have the full song list announced.

1524
01:52:10,231 --> 01:52:12,613
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll probably give you about 10 songs a week until it's all out there.

1525
01:52:13,194 --> 01:52:14,895
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, how about Toy Story 3?

1526
01:52:15,916 --> 01:52:17,017
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's not just a movie.

1527
01:52:17,077 --> 01:52:17,917
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a game as well.

1528
01:52:18,298 --> 01:52:19,138
[SPEAKER_04]: The game is out there.

1529
01:52:19,218 --> 01:52:20,539
[SPEAKER_04]: It's on the Wii, I'm sure.

1530
01:52:20,599 --> 01:52:23,121
[SPEAKER_04]: It's also on the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3.

1531
01:52:23,982 --> 01:52:29,987
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, the PlayStation 3 is taking the opportunity of having this unique hybrid premium edition.

1532
01:52:30,447 --> 01:52:51,100
[SPEAKER_04]: So there is actually a new version out there of Toy Story 3 bundled with the original Toy Story movie on a single Blu-ray disc for $64.99 So it's interesting that it's not just like a combo pack but it's actually both things were put onto one disc for $65 Interesting

1533
01:52:55,060 --> 01:53:02,241
[SPEAKER_04]: but sadly it's not both Toy Story and Toy Story 2 otherwise that would be a really killer deal but what about Toy Story 2?

1534
01:53:04,608 --> 01:53:07,410
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1535
01:53:33,627 --> 01:53:54,057
[SPEAKER_04]: you can't type in your own stuff you have to use the pre-selected phrases and things that have been selected for you well one of the other things you can do in the game is that you can pick your own car number because of course you're playing race cars so you can have whatever car number you want except for 69 you cannot be car 69 in the cars MMO can you be car 420?

1536
01:53:55,198 --> 01:54:00,020
[SPEAKER_04]: no because the cars only have two digits but you could be car 54 and you could be like where are you?

1537
01:54:01,141 --> 01:54:01,481
[SPEAKER_04]: old joke

1538
01:54:03,825 --> 01:54:05,486
[SPEAKER_10]: So it had the dude that played Herman Munster.

1539
01:54:05,506 --> 01:54:06,087
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep, it did.

1540
01:54:06,907 --> 01:54:07,347
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

1541
01:54:07,768 --> 01:54:14,291
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, when you're selecting, apparently when you're in the game selecting the number for your car, if you go like, you select each digit one at a time.

1542
01:54:14,331 --> 01:54:18,554
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you select, you know, four, five, seven, then you see one through nine is the next digit.

1543
01:54:18,574 --> 01:54:21,316
[SPEAKER_04]: But when you select six, it only goes zero through eight.

1544
01:54:22,336 --> 01:54:23,437
[SPEAKER_04]: So interesting, huh?

1545
01:54:24,177 --> 01:54:24,678
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura

1546
01:54:44,167 --> 01:54:49,211
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, how about something different, something in the Squeenix direction?

1547
01:54:49,671 --> 01:54:51,372
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember we talked about Gun Loco?

1548
01:54:52,473 --> 01:54:56,056
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it turns out it's a game about a planet full of criminals.

1549
01:54:56,616 --> 01:54:57,657
[SPEAKER_10]: They're all crazy.

1550
01:54:58,238 --> 01:55:00,459
[SPEAKER_10]: Crazy, crazy, crazy criminals with guns.

1551
01:55:01,580 --> 01:55:05,643
[SPEAKER_10]: And the world's sort of like an earthish ruin type place.

1552
01:55:06,304 --> 01:55:08,806
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's different factions and they're always fightin'.

1553
01:55:10,007 --> 01:55:14,892
[SPEAKER_10]: So it looks completely hilarious.

1554
01:55:15,213 --> 01:55:18,997
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I would really, really like to play it.

1555
01:55:19,037 --> 01:55:25,804
[SPEAKER_10]: All the characters were done by Kenny Wong and basically made toys of everything and then they scanned them into the game.

1556
01:55:25,885 --> 01:55:28,167
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's how the design come about.

1557
01:55:28,327 --> 01:55:28,848
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's pretty cool.

1558
01:55:30,726 --> 01:55:33,708
[SPEAKER_10]: And then for Rock Band, we have the Disturbed Pack.

1559
01:55:35,269 --> 01:55:39,451
[SPEAKER_10]: That's going to be on August 24th, a couple days from now.

1560
01:55:39,971 --> 01:55:43,133
[SPEAKER_10]: The Disturbed Pack has Another Way to Die, Asylum, and The Animal.

1561
01:55:44,013 --> 01:55:53,518
[SPEAKER_10]: And then there's Universal Motown Republic Rock Pack, which is Crash Kings, Mountain Man, The Veer Union Seasons, and We Are the Fallen, Bury Me Alive.

1562
01:55:54,679 --> 01:56:13,713
[SPEAKER_10]: They're also, only one of those is available in Lego Rock Band And that is the Vera Union Seasons And lastly, the big Horkin grocery store chain in England called Tesco You've heard of them, I'm sure No, because they don't have them here Actually, they do Do they?

1563
01:56:14,373 --> 01:56:20,378
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a company called Fresh and Easy That's a Tesco chain in the United States

1564
01:56:21,292 --> 01:56:21,392
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh.

1565
01:56:22,294 --> 01:56:23,938
[SPEAKER_10]: Still, I don't think I've ever been one, but okay.

1566
01:56:24,218 --> 01:56:24,919
[SPEAKER_10]: Tiara told me about them.

1567
01:56:25,982 --> 01:56:27,505
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's just be opening a couple in Sacramento.

1568
01:56:28,550 --> 01:56:32,872
[SPEAKER_10]: But anyway, it's like a big grocery store chain.

1569
01:56:33,032 --> 01:56:37,934
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, they are now going to be buying used games.

1570
01:56:39,114 --> 01:56:42,836
[SPEAKER_10]: You will be paid in credit, and then you can buy whatever you need in the grocery store.

1571
01:56:44,916 --> 01:56:50,439
[SPEAKER_10]: So basically they're saying, like for Red Dead Redemption, you'll get a 19-pound trade-in.

1572
01:56:51,079 --> 01:56:52,279
[SPEAKER_10]: Mario Kart for Wii gets 19 pounds.

1573
01:56:52,299 --> 01:56:54,320
[SPEAKER_10]: FIFA 2010 gets 12 pounds, that type of thing.

1574
01:56:56,981 --> 01:57:05,412
[SPEAKER_10]: and then they're going to resell the stores at other outlets and already about 60 Tesco stores accept them

1575
01:57:07,190 --> 01:57:08,591
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody wants a piece of that industry.

1576
01:57:08,951 --> 01:57:09,412
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess so.

1577
01:57:09,592 --> 01:57:15,016
[SPEAKER_14]: Now when someone says they have to pick between video games and food, if money's hurting, they can literally... They can literally do that.

1578
01:57:15,076 --> 01:57:19,399
[SPEAKER_14]: If I like, I had to give up, you know, Red Dead Redemption, but I got some Top Ramen.

1579
01:57:19,739 --> 01:57:20,099
[SPEAKER_14]: There you go.

1580
01:57:20,119 --> 01:57:20,319
[SPEAKER_12]: Awesome.

1581
01:57:21,540 --> 01:57:23,842
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's get into some Twitter topics tonight.

1582
01:57:24,182 --> 01:57:32,868
[SPEAKER_04]: Every week you guys submit us topics at www.twitter.com slash OLR, and we pick a few of our favorite topics and read through them here on the show.

1583
01:57:33,508 --> 01:57:33,609
[SPEAKER_04]: And...

1584
01:57:34,589 --> 01:57:36,770
[SPEAKER_04]: Sadly, I seem to be without my music tonight.

1585
01:57:36,930 --> 01:57:37,491
[SPEAKER_04]: What did I do?

1586
01:57:39,592 --> 01:57:40,292
[SPEAKER_04]: I broke it all.

1587
01:57:40,853 --> 01:57:43,494
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I guess Twitter topic's canceled because I don't have a theme song.

1588
01:57:43,594 --> 01:57:44,154
[SPEAKER_10]: I blame Rob.

1589
01:57:44,275 --> 01:57:44,815
[SPEAKER_10]: I blame Rob.

1590
01:57:46,716 --> 01:57:47,416
[SPEAKER_04]: Live radio.

1591
01:57:47,556 --> 01:57:50,418
[SPEAKER_04]: You just want to sing the theme song tonight?

1592
01:57:52,299 --> 01:57:53,320
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, thank God we're all saved.

1593
01:57:53,420 --> 01:57:53,680
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1594
01:57:55,781 --> 01:57:56,922
[SPEAKER_04]: Twitter.com slash OLR.

1595
01:58:00,307 --> 01:58:03,690
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see who tweeted us this week here.

1596
01:58:04,811 --> 01:58:07,013
[SPEAKER_04]: Redertainment sends us a tweet.

1597
01:58:08,194 --> 01:58:13,859
[SPEAKER_04]: It says, You mean a game so bad that it's kind of good?

1598
01:58:14,720 --> 01:58:15,861
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I'll say this.

1599
01:58:15,921 --> 01:58:16,621
[SPEAKER_04]: There really was.

1600
01:58:16,661 --> 01:58:18,503
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a Rocky Horror Show game.

1601
01:58:18,523 --> 01:58:19,204
[SPEAKER_04]: There was two of them.

1602
01:58:19,704 --> 01:58:20,245
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1603
01:58:36,534 --> 01:58:42,059
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a CD-ROM based one in the mid-90s for one of the big UK revivals.

1604
01:58:43,360 --> 01:58:47,944
[SPEAKER_04]: Back when full motion video was in every CD-ROM game, they actually had a Rocky Horror Show game there.

1605
01:58:47,964 --> 01:58:50,126
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was released, I think, exclusively in the UK.

1606
01:58:50,166 --> 01:58:51,127
[SPEAKER_04]: So I never played it.

1607
01:58:51,587 --> 01:58:53,009
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if people out there did.

1608
01:58:53,469 --> 01:58:54,290
[SPEAKER_04]: But that would be it.

1609
01:58:54,570 --> 01:58:56,552
[SPEAKER_04]: What about a game so bad it's kind of good?

1610
01:58:57,192 --> 01:59:01,716
[SPEAKER_04]: How about not taking the question so literally and a game so bad it's kind of good?

1611
01:59:03,037 --> 01:59:07,921
[SPEAKER_04]: I think about Loki and how he talks about Driver 3 all the time, that it's so terrible that it's actually kind of fun.

1612
01:59:08,781 --> 01:59:09,522
[SPEAKER_04]: Earth Defense Force 2017.

1613
01:59:09,682 --> 01:59:14,245
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very terrible game, but it's very fun.

1614
01:59:15,506 --> 01:59:17,427
[SPEAKER_10]: I think back in the day for me it was Abydox.

1615
01:59:20,029 --> 01:59:25,432
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if I can think of one that I really go, gosh, that game is so bad, but I love it for some reason.

1616
01:59:26,213 --> 01:59:27,794
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything come to your mind, Alan, to think of?

1617
01:59:29,690 --> 01:59:34,173
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not sure if I'm thinking of terrible or just really difficult, but Battletoads?

1618
01:59:35,974 --> 01:59:36,595
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought of one.

1619
01:59:36,955 --> 01:59:37,515
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought of one.

1620
01:59:37,915 --> 01:59:41,278
[SPEAKER_10]: A game that we actually played on end because it was so awful.

1621
01:59:41,898 --> 01:59:42,338
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?

1622
01:59:42,538 --> 01:59:43,479
[SPEAKER_10]: Toshinden 3.

1623
01:59:45,080 --> 01:59:46,221
[SPEAKER_10]: It had the butt monkey in it.

1624
01:59:48,222 --> 01:59:51,564
[SPEAKER_10]: Seriously, it had this, like a baboon, so it had the big exposed butt.

1625
01:59:52,245 --> 01:59:54,126
[SPEAKER_10]: And it would fly its butt at people.

1626
01:59:54,806 --> 01:59:58,349
[SPEAKER_10]: And then there was this one guy who his taunt was shooting people.

1627
01:59:59,850 --> 02:00:01,612
[SPEAKER_10]: He could just take damage off by taunting.

1628
02:00:02,292 --> 02:00:03,473
[SPEAKER_10]: Just shoot, bang.

1629
02:00:03,633 --> 02:00:07,056
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was so bad, and the voice acting was so horrible.

1630
02:00:07,116 --> 02:00:14,082
[SPEAKER_10]: And even to this day, when I'm hanging out with Mystique and we see a monkey, we'll go, butt monkey dance, butt monkey dance.

1631
02:00:14,363 --> 02:00:15,464
[SPEAKER_10]: Because he'd dance when he won.

1632
02:00:18,302 --> 02:00:23,046
[SPEAKER_04]: TigerClaw, leave it to him to have the Google Foo skills to find more information.

1633
02:00:23,486 --> 02:00:32,192
[SPEAKER_04]: The Rocky Interactive Horror Show game was released in March-April 1999 for the PC by OnlinePLC.

1634
02:00:32,632 --> 02:00:38,716
[SPEAKER_04]: Similarly to the earlier CRL game, the player plays as Brad or Janet and must rescue their partner from the castle.

1635
02:00:39,056 --> 02:00:47,282
[SPEAKER_04]: Unlike the older computer game, its gameplay was more puzzle-oriented and benefited from the added detail, graphics, and live video sequences that the PC could provide.

1636
02:00:48,202 --> 02:00:49,543
[SPEAKER_04]: Was Frankenfurter in it though?

1637
02:00:49,623 --> 02:00:55,685
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if Frankenfurter's not in it, I mean Tim Curry single-handedly makes that movie.

1638
02:00:56,385 --> 02:00:56,746
[SPEAKER_04]: He does.

1639
02:00:58,286 --> 02:01:03,128
[SPEAKER_04]: The screams of thousands of people when Frankenfurter first shows up in the movie tell me so.

1640
02:01:03,828 --> 02:01:04,349
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anyhow.

1641
02:01:05,209 --> 02:01:07,790
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see other tweets that we have.

1642
02:01:07,830 --> 02:01:09,411
[SPEAKER_04]: Twitter.com slash OLR.

1643
02:01:10,251 --> 02:01:14,393
[SPEAKER_04]: Tigerclaw sends us a link about an Italian city that's pissed at Gran Turismo 5.

1644
02:01:15,013 --> 02:01:16,814
[SPEAKER_04]: Now why would you be angry at Gran Turismo 5?

1645
02:01:17,674 --> 02:01:22,879
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, apparently Siena is a city in Tuscany, Italy.

1646
02:01:23,400 --> 02:01:32,208
[SPEAKER_04]: They're very unhappy that one of their, I guess, famous roads, the Piazza del Campo, is actually a race course in Gran Turismo 5's kart mode.

1647
02:01:32,509 --> 02:01:33,790
[SPEAKER_04]: They want it removed in the game.

1648
02:01:34,370 --> 02:01:39,115
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not that the road is in the game or the structures or what have you.

1649
02:01:39,716 --> 02:01:40,897
[SPEAKER_04]: It's also...

1650
02:01:42,765 --> 02:01:44,025
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to see what it is here.

1651
02:01:45,366 --> 02:01:49,647
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, when we get things from Twitter, we haven't had a chance to look at them in advance or whatever.

1652
02:01:51,527 --> 02:01:54,028
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess because it's also partially a horse race.

1653
02:01:54,688 --> 02:01:55,168
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I see.

1654
02:01:55,268 --> 02:01:59,309
[SPEAKER_04]: The Piazza del Campo is also the name of a famous horse racing track.

1655
02:01:59,709 --> 02:02:02,570
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess they don't want people to kind of get confused over what's going on there.

1656
02:02:02,930 --> 02:02:08,475
[SPEAKER_04]: So they've sent out a, quote, diplomatic request to Sony to resolve the matter.

1657
02:02:08,895 --> 02:02:16,581
[SPEAKER_04]: This game's coming out very soon, though, so I don't know if it's going to be able to be fixed unless they patch it out because that's how they fix everything these days, right?

1658
02:02:19,715 --> 02:02:20,116
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

1659
02:02:21,457 --> 02:02:23,118
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll read this one too from Tiger Claw.

1660
02:02:23,238 --> 02:02:24,620
[SPEAKER_04]: We give everybody at least two tweets.

1661
02:02:25,120 --> 02:02:26,762
[SPEAKER_04]: So Tiger Claw sends us this tweet.

1662
02:02:27,242 --> 02:02:31,646
[SPEAKER_04]: Disney Online hits a traffic high with 36 million monthly visitors.

1663
02:02:31,766 --> 02:02:32,066
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

1664
02:02:32,447 --> 02:02:33,508
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're not... How much are on Facebook?

1665
02:02:35,233 --> 02:02:36,093
[SPEAKER_04]: How much of that's on Facebook?

1666
02:02:36,113 --> 02:02:38,334
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't really get their users through Facebook, do they?

1667
02:02:38,655 --> 02:02:39,895
[SPEAKER_04]: But they do Club Penguin.

1668
02:02:40,375 --> 02:02:43,537
[SPEAKER_04]: You've seen those Club Penguin cards at Target and all those other stores.

1669
02:02:43,557 --> 02:02:44,957
[SPEAKER_04]: That's probably their biggest game there.

1670
02:02:45,958 --> 02:02:49,500
[SPEAKER_04]: They also have Toontown Online, Disney Fairies, Pixie Hollow.

1671
02:02:49,560 --> 02:02:51,400
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't even know there was a Disney Fairies, Pixie Hollow.

1672
02:02:52,061 --> 02:02:52,561
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

1673
02:02:52,621 --> 02:02:54,542
[SPEAKER_04]: So lots and lots of games that Disney has.

1674
02:02:55,682 --> 02:02:57,403
[SPEAKER_04]: They've hit quite a milestone there.

1675
02:02:57,923 --> 02:02:58,904
[SPEAKER_04]: Never played one of them.

1676
02:02:59,724 --> 02:03:00,625
[SPEAKER_04]: I love penguins, too.

1677
02:03:00,685 --> 02:03:03,126
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why I've never played Club Penguin, but I just haven't.

1678
02:03:03,846 --> 02:03:05,947
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Blaziken sends us a variety of stories.

1679
02:03:06,187 --> 02:03:08,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of them we're going to be talking about earlier or later.

1680
02:03:08,988 --> 02:03:10,549
[SPEAKER_04]: But this one I don't think goes on our show roll.

1681
02:03:10,569 --> 02:03:12,030
[SPEAKER_04]: This has to do with other Blizzard stuff.

1682
02:03:12,410 --> 02:03:16,071
[SPEAKER_04]: Big things planned for Diablo 3 at this year's BlizzCon.

1683
02:03:16,652 --> 02:03:20,333
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently there is big Diablo 3 news coming out at BlizzCon this year.

1684
02:03:20,693 --> 02:03:22,414
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be split into three games.

1685
02:03:23,055 --> 02:03:23,795
[SPEAKER_04]: No, let's hope not.

1686
02:03:26,256 --> 02:03:27,816
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess this is coming out of Gamescom.

1687
02:03:27,856 --> 02:03:36,759
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the game's director, Jay Wilson, saying, quote, I can say that this BlizzCon, in terms of Diablo news, will be the biggest one that we've ever had.

1688
02:03:37,119 --> 02:03:39,300
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's probably because that's the game they're going to focus most on.

1689
02:03:39,340 --> 02:03:42,621
[SPEAKER_04]: Because by that point, we ought to know the release date for Cataclysm.

1690
02:03:43,061 --> 02:03:44,921
[SPEAKER_04]: And it'll be out either just before or just after.

1691
02:03:44,941 --> 02:03:48,462
[SPEAKER_02]: Did they even have BlizzCon back in the Diablo 2 days?

1692
02:03:48,563 --> 02:03:49,223
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they didn't.

1693
02:03:49,463 --> 02:03:51,924
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course it's going to be the one they've had the most Diablo days.

1694
02:03:51,944 --> 02:03:53,104
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what the hell that means.

1695
02:03:53,604 --> 02:03:57,249
[SPEAKER_04]: and I'm sure they're going to reveal another playable class in the game.

1696
02:03:57,289 --> 02:04:00,873
[SPEAKER_04]: They say there's only going to be one more, a fifth class, and they've announced all the others.

1697
02:04:01,634 --> 02:04:02,055
[SPEAKER_04]: Cheerleader.

1698
02:04:03,577 --> 02:04:04,097
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's hope.

1699
02:04:04,238 --> 02:04:07,942
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe they'll release a peripheral for the keyboard like they had on WeCheer.

1700
02:04:08,243 --> 02:04:08,884
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be great.

1701
02:04:10,786 --> 02:04:11,547
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see what happens.

1702
02:04:14,093 --> 02:04:21,284
[SPEAKER_04]: Yo, what's really interesting though about that is that, you know, with StarCraft 2 having had the digital distribution day one, I bet Diablo 3 is going to have that too.

1703
02:04:21,364 --> 02:04:25,491
[SPEAKER_04]: So I wonder if it's really going to have that big midnight launch or what have you.

1704
02:04:25,611 --> 02:04:27,434
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1705
02:04:27,514 --> 02:04:27,995
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

1706
02:04:28,115 --> 02:04:28,596
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow.

1707
02:04:30,777 --> 02:04:35,939
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh dear, we're getting linked to this by Actdeft, and I just see furries in the title, so I'm worried about this.

1708
02:04:36,419 --> 02:04:43,222
[SPEAKER_04]: He links this to a story from Kotaku that says, Microsoft Kinect supports furries, and it's got a video on it.

1709
02:04:44,202 --> 02:04:45,163
[SPEAKER_04]: Do I want to see this?

1710
02:04:46,643 --> 02:04:47,524
[SPEAKER_04]: We know what you're thinking.

1711
02:04:47,544 --> 02:04:51,285
[SPEAKER_04]: Will Microsoft Kinect read your body when fully encased in a fursuit?

1712
02:04:53,206 --> 02:04:55,127
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, this is coming from Kotaku, I guess.

1713
02:04:57,850 --> 02:05:03,172
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, and sure enough, somebody is dancing there in a full kitty costume there to Dance Central.

1714
02:05:05,353 --> 02:05:08,534
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Actdeft, for wasting 30 seconds of my life.

1715
02:05:08,594 --> 02:05:09,614
[SPEAKER_04]: I will never be able to get back.

1716
02:05:09,674 --> 02:05:17,837
[SPEAKER_14]: So at DragonCon over Labor Day weekend, they can, you know, they can yiff in the privacy of their hotel rooms or they can get their gaga on.

1717
02:05:20,117 --> 02:05:22,419
[SPEAKER_04]: Yo, Bobby's going to DragonCon.

1718
02:05:22,679 --> 02:05:24,381
[SPEAKER_04]: Bobby, I would like to request... I hope he's still listening.

1719
02:05:24,421 --> 02:05:30,526
[SPEAKER_04]: Bobby, I would really like to request a full furry report on the furry scene at DragonCon.

1720
02:05:30,706 --> 02:05:31,047
[SPEAKER_04]: Sound good?

1721
02:05:31,447 --> 02:05:32,188
[SPEAKER_14]: Bring some Purell.

1722
02:05:35,049 --> 02:05:36,330
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd say bring the candle, I saw.

1723
02:05:37,751 --> 02:05:43,956
[SPEAKER_04]: Dark Kasuke sends us a tweet on Twitter saying that Star Wars Clone Wars open beta open today.

1724
02:05:44,737 --> 02:05:45,017
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

1725
02:05:45,117 --> 02:05:45,897
[SPEAKER_04]: I did not know that.

1726
02:05:45,957 --> 02:05:49,941
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of these big games coming out the Christmas season, I guess, are having their betas open up.

1727
02:05:50,241 --> 02:05:52,322
[SPEAKER_04]: What I want to know, when's the DC Universe one open up?

1728
02:05:52,743 --> 02:05:53,884
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the one I really want to play.

1729
02:05:54,604 --> 02:05:55,225
[SPEAKER_04]: Really bad.

1730
02:05:56,631 --> 02:06:02,493
[SPEAKER_04]: And lastly, Alex P. Carson tweets us saying, Does anybody know the official name of the Super Mario version of M.I.A.

1731
02:06:02,553 --> 02:06:05,134
[SPEAKER_04]: Paper Planes that was on the Afterbirth a while back?

1732
02:06:05,674 --> 02:06:06,954
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, that's making me think.

1733
02:06:07,374 --> 02:06:14,236
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a website that has tons of chiptunes, and I can't think of the name of it right now, but hopefully somebody in chat will remember.

1734
02:06:14,816 --> 02:06:18,558
[SPEAKER_04]: And we found it on there, and I bet if you search for Paper Planes, you could find it.

1735
02:06:18,758 --> 02:06:21,999
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some huge chiptunes website, and I can't remember the name of it.

1736
02:06:22,019 --> 02:06:23,219
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, it totally escapes me right now.

1737
02:06:24,218 --> 02:06:25,659
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody in chat will remember what it is.

1738
02:06:26,319 --> 02:06:28,260
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like it's just a bunch of homegrown stuff.

1739
02:06:28,321 --> 02:06:31,663
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you like that, you'll probably like a lot of the stuff that's on there.

1740
02:06:32,243 --> 02:06:34,164
[SPEAKER_04]: So hopefully somebody in chat will shout it out here soon.

1741
02:06:34,204 --> 02:06:35,445
[SPEAKER_04]: If not, I'll Google it in a minute.

1742
02:06:35,485 --> 02:06:35,985
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll find it.

1743
02:06:37,346 --> 02:06:38,427
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me Google that for you.

1744
02:06:38,967 --> 02:06:40,488
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, that's going to do it for Twitter topics tonight.

1745
02:06:40,508 --> 02:06:44,911
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to send us tweets in the future, twitter.com slash OLR.

1746
02:06:45,311 --> 02:06:48,833
[SPEAKER_04]: In the meantime, while I try to figure out what song that was, Loki.

1747
02:06:50,051 --> 02:06:59,859
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, this week both the Guitar Hero Warriors of Rock tracklist and Rock Band 3 tracklist were revealed.

1748
02:07:00,619 --> 02:07:05,223
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's interesting because there's definitely a lot of stuff to go over.

1749
02:07:06,123 --> 02:07:34,534
[SPEAKER_02]: so let's start off with Guitar Hero Warriors of Rock and there's going to be 93 tracks I'm not going to go through all of these but some of the ones I thought were interesting Rush 2112 they have all 7 parts of it that's kind of neat I guess let's see what were some of the ones that stood out to me Rammstein they've got a song from them looks like Wade Mann's Heil

1750
02:07:35,434 --> 02:07:37,935
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see here.

[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, both games have that.

1753
02:07:43,517 --> 02:07:44,497
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an awesome song.

1754
02:07:46,118 --> 02:07:52,720
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, there was a Queen slot machine that I played in Reno and it's the most amazing gambling device I've ever played.

1755
02:07:54,740 --> 02:08:01,703
[SPEAKER_04]: The bonus round, it lets me pick a Queen song and then the game plays itself for free for like a minute while I sit there and listen to Radio Gaga.

1756
02:08:01,723 --> 02:08:02,343
[SPEAKER_04]: It's amazing.

1757
02:08:03,904 --> 02:08:04,567
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.

1758
02:08:05,852 --> 02:08:08,966
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, what other songs on here?

02:08:40,470 --> 02:08:45,259
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, did you see that video where they confessed up that the Rock Band 3 leak was real, basically?

1761
02:08:45,560 --> 02:08:49,347
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they have the Rock Band full tracklist behind them.

1762
02:08:49,928 --> 02:08:50,670
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was funny.

1763
02:08:52,290 --> 02:08:53,471
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, so yeah, lots of stuff.

1764
02:08:53,491 --> 02:08:54,472
[SPEAKER_02]: The list is out there.

1765
02:08:54,492 --> 02:08:57,954

[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of things from there.

1769
02:09:08,081 --> 02:09:15,927
[SPEAKER_02]: Their track list is a little bit smaller, but of course you get all the download content from Rock Band 2 and all the tracks from that and anything else you pretty much have bought.

1770
02:09:16,427 --> 02:09:16,527
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

1771
02:09:17,995 --> 02:09:24,068
[SPEAKER_02]: So, starting off with that, they have Amy Winehouse in Rehab, but I didn't really think of that as a rock song, but okay.

1772
02:09:27,458 --> 02:09:31,320
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1774
02:10:10,319 --> 02:10:14,541
[SPEAKER_10]: If it's in German that would be great I have to sort of digress

1775
02:10:15,666 --> 02:10:15,987
[SPEAKER_04]: Why not?

1776
02:10:16,027 --> 02:10:17,008
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what we do here on the show.

1777
02:10:17,048 --> 02:10:28,043
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the E3 trips, all the DDR Freak moderators got together and went to the Korean karaoke place and Doohast was on there and we were all singing Doohast in our worst Rammstein German voices.

1778
02:10:28,464 --> 02:10:29,585
[SPEAKER_10]: Doohast mich!

1779
02:10:30,026 --> 02:10:30,366
[SPEAKER_10]: You know.

1780
02:10:31,027 --> 02:10:31,288
[SPEAKER_10]: All that.

1781
02:10:31,308 --> 02:10:31,688
[SPEAKER_10]: It was great.

1782
02:10:31,868 --> 02:10:32,069
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice.

1783
02:10:33,426 --> 02:10:54,996

[SPEAKER_02]: Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, I need to know.

1785
02:11:00,579 --> 02:11:02,840
[SPEAKER_02]: Curse of Fears, Everybody Wants to Rule the World.

1786
02:11:03,741 --> 02:11:04,501
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of cool stuff.

1787
02:11:04,822 --> 02:11:11,266
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just looking forward to actually being able to play a lot of these songs with the keyboard, which would be really sweet.

1788
02:11:11,286 --> 02:11:15,069
[SPEAKER_04]: I really hope they go back and add keyboard support for some of the old classic download songs.

1789
02:11:15,189 --> 02:11:18,671
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't know if they're gonna, but it would be neat.

1790
02:11:20,192 --> 02:11:21,573
[SPEAKER_04]: They really need to, just saying.

1791
02:11:22,013 --> 02:11:24,195
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, they have Deep Purple, Smoke on the Water.

1792
02:11:24,855 --> 02:11:26,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably the better Deep Purple song, if you ask me.

1793
02:11:28,075 --> 02:11:28,996
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1794
02:11:29,036 --> 02:11:32,418
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, just to answer that tweet from a few minutes ago, finally found the answer there.

1795
02:11:32,439 --> 02:11:45,269
[SPEAKER_04]: We're using my Google Foo, and the listener's in chat room and found it already, but just for anybody else who's listening, the artist's name is CSLSX, and the website I was trying to think of, 8-Bit Collective, which is actually a really good website for a bunch of chiptunes.

1796
02:11:45,629 --> 02:11:53,815
[SPEAKER_04]: It's 8, the number 8, not spelled out, actually the number 8, bc.org, and you can get all these NES chiptunes.

1797
02:12:03,530 --> 02:12:07,200
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, that was the worst possible clip of the song I could play for you guys, but it's not bad.

1798
02:12:07,742 --> 02:12:08,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Go check it out.

1799
02:12:10,097 --> 02:12:12,559
[SPEAKER_04]: THQ is putting out a new game tablet for the Wii.

1800
02:12:37,997 --> 02:12:39,218
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called U-Draw.

1801
02:12:39,539 --> 02:12:42,282
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a 4x6 inch tablet and it's going to be coming out for the Wii.

1802
02:12:42,862 --> 02:12:46,506
[SPEAKER_04]: It will be coming out for $70 and it comes with U-Draw Studio.

1803
02:12:46,907 --> 02:12:49,650
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a drawing, coloring, and art based video game.

1804
02:12:49,990 --> 02:12:51,592
[SPEAKER_04]: Which I think is kind of cool.

1805
02:12:51,672 --> 02:12:53,154
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Mario Paint basically.

1806
02:12:53,214 --> 02:12:55,616
[SPEAKER_04]: And how long have we been saying they need to do Mario Paint on the Wii?

1807
02:12:56,357 --> 02:13:21,441
[SPEAKER_04]: THQ is kind of doing it the way it ought to be done and what I love too is that one of the promotional shots here for the game is somebody who has drawn wait for it I'm trying to bring it up here in studio they've actually drawn on the screen oh damn it's a unicorn somebody drew a unicorn I was going to say a butt but unicorn works too I'm wondering if there wouldn't be some way that they're going to make an adapter to use it on the PC or something because it's definitely cheaper than buying just use a bluetooth adapter

1808
02:13:23,201 --> 02:13:30,447
[SPEAKER_10]: In the end though, I mean, I paid $400 for my tablet and I can use Photoshop.

1809
02:13:31,868 --> 02:13:33,849
[SPEAKER_04]: But Jamie, can you draw that bitch in Unicorn?

1810
02:13:34,190 --> 02:13:35,611
[SPEAKER_10]: I could draw that Unicorn right now.

1811
02:13:36,751 --> 02:13:43,577
[SPEAKER_14]: And I just got a hate on Apple a little bit, but the fact that the Wii has a proper tablet means that it's more of an iPad than the iPad is.

1812
02:13:46,599 --> 02:13:47,139
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

1813
02:13:47,199 --> 02:13:48,460
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm drawing a Unicorn right now.

1814
02:13:48,840 --> 02:13:49,161
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay.

1815
02:13:50,161 --> 02:13:50,242
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

1816
02:13:51,801 --> 02:13:52,382
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, you know what?

1817
02:13:52,562 --> 02:13:55,164
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been needing new album art for Orange Lounge Radio.

1818
02:13:55,224 --> 02:13:56,806
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm still waiting on this picture.

1819
02:13:56,826 --> 02:13:59,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think it should be... You took one of me like years ago.

1820
02:13:59,608 --> 02:14:03,572
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, I think we should just have a giant unicorn in the album art.

1821
02:14:03,932 --> 02:14:10,919
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of unicorns, and I know I'm a little bit behind in times because I used to check their YouTube feed every now and then.

1822
02:14:11,559 --> 02:14:13,561
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a new Charlie the Unicorn.

1823
02:14:13,621 --> 02:14:15,223
[SPEAKER_02]: Except it's not Charlie the Unicorn, it's...

1824
02:14:15,783 --> 02:14:25,730
[SPEAKER_02]: Charlie T Unicron and it's like these remixed versions of the Charlie Unicorn episodes and it was hilarious because they burned down the forest

1825
02:14:28,482 --> 02:14:29,382
[SPEAKER_14]: Candy Mountain.

1826
02:14:30,022 --> 02:14:30,463
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, anyway.

1827
02:14:31,303 --> 02:14:32,503
[SPEAKER_04]: Some other games that are coming out.

1828
02:14:32,723 --> 02:14:35,664
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not the only game coming out is the Mario Paint-ish clone.

1829
02:14:36,104 --> 02:14:43,547
[SPEAKER_04]: UDraw will also be getting launch games Pictionary, because, you know, we've got to have more of the board games on the Wii, and Dude's Big Adventure.

1830
02:14:43,607 --> 02:14:46,187
[SPEAKER_04]: That's D-O-O-D, like doodle.

1831
02:14:47,088 --> 02:14:47,428
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude.

1832
02:14:47,928 --> 02:14:49,048
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude's Big Adventure.

1833
02:14:49,408 --> 02:14:51,549
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a world where coloring books come to life.

1834
02:14:52,170 --> 02:14:59,032
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently it's heavily inspired by the game Drawn to Life, which was also a THQ game, so they're just kind of getting themselves there.

1835
02:14:59,852 --> 02:15:02,772
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure the next Drawn to Life game will support this as well.

1836
02:15:03,533 --> 02:15:03,953
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

1837
02:15:03,973 --> 02:15:05,073
[SPEAKER_09]: There's your damn unicorn.

1838
02:15:05,913 --> 02:15:06,373
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay!

1839
02:15:06,893 --> 02:15:13,155
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't hold the pen very well to... I can't hold my stylus very well to control my... Can you put a picture of that up on OrangeLaunchRadio.com?

1840
02:15:13,175 --> 02:15:13,395
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

1841
02:15:14,375 --> 02:15:14,895
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, awesome.

1842
02:15:14,955 --> 02:15:15,635
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll try to make it look better.

1843
02:15:16,415 --> 02:15:16,635
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1844
02:15:18,576 --> 02:15:18,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

1845
02:15:19,150 --> 02:15:19,950
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, UDraw.

1846
02:15:19,970 --> 02:15:20,351
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1847
02:15:20,411 --> 02:15:22,032
[SPEAKER_04]: Is anyone in here interested in UDraw?

1848
02:15:22,052 --> 02:15:25,453
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess DarkSakura made a pretty good case for it if it would work on the PC.

1849
02:15:26,154 --> 02:15:26,374
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope.

1850
02:15:26,694 --> 02:15:28,035
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm not really interested either.

1851
02:15:28,075 --> 02:15:29,075
[SPEAKER_04]: But I do want an iPad.

1852
02:15:31,877 --> 02:15:37,019
[SPEAKER_14]: I think a lot of dinner parties have ended in divorce due to bad rounds of Pictionary.

1853
02:15:37,500 --> 02:15:39,881
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm glad that that experience can now come to the Wii.

1854
02:15:39,981 --> 02:15:40,941
[SPEAKER_14]: To a whole new generation.

1855
02:15:41,061 --> 02:15:41,262
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1856
02:15:41,322 --> 02:15:41,822
[SPEAKER_14]: That'll be fun.

1857
02:15:43,687 --> 02:15:48,589
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, I hate to tear you away from unicorn drawing, but there is more gaming news to be talked about tonight, correct?

1858
02:15:48,829 --> 02:15:49,549
[SPEAKER_10]: The Doctor!

1859
02:15:51,230 --> 02:15:53,731
[SPEAKER_10]: Doctor Who, there's going to be a third game.

1860
02:15:54,972 --> 02:15:55,132
[SPEAKER_10]: Ooh.

1861
02:15:56,012 --> 02:15:58,954
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, a third episode of Doctor Who, the adventure games.

1862
02:15:59,834 --> 02:16:28,759
[SPEAKER_10]: this one's called TARDIS and you get to fly the TARDIS it'll be out on the 27th of August and the whole thing is that you have to explore the entire TARDIS and the TARDIS is freaking big remember, it's bigger on the inside and then you can fly the TARDIS so that's pretty cool you know, it's basically overcoming 40 years of what's it like to pilot the TARDIS in one game

1863
02:16:30,615 --> 02:16:32,857
[SPEAKER_10]: Although really, the TARDIS is meant to be piloted by six people.

1864
02:16:32,978 --> 02:16:35,160
[SPEAKER_04]: It should be a bullet hell game featuring the TARDIS.

1865
02:16:35,720 --> 02:16:37,322
[SPEAKER_10]: The TARDIS can't shoot anything.

1866
02:16:38,143 --> 02:16:39,284
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds retardous.

1867
02:16:41,246 --> 02:16:50,196
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, this one's featuring the 11th Doctor being Matt Smith and Amy Pond played by Karen Gillan, so pretty cool.

1868
02:16:51,826 --> 02:16:54,131
[SPEAKER_10]: and it's free for all you people in the UK.

1869
02:16:54,211 --> 02:16:54,972
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the best part.

1870
02:16:55,072 --> 02:16:56,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, don't we have to pay for it though?

1871
02:16:56,595 --> 02:17:01,405
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the Brits get it subsidized with their television tax or whatever but we have to actually pay for it, huh?

1872
02:17:01,625 --> 02:17:02,847
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, we don't have TV tax.

1873
02:17:04,701 --> 02:17:06,482
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, great that we don't have TV tax.

1874
02:17:06,862 --> 02:17:11,866
[SPEAKER_04]: Although Comcast kind of sends me a TV tax bill every month, but I guess that's a whole other issue.

1875
02:17:12,206 --> 02:17:14,008
[SPEAKER_04]: You know I am going to be ditching cable TV though.

1876
02:17:15,609 --> 02:17:22,414
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, with an HD receiver, I can just go get a good HD antenna for $50 and I can get my basic channels, which is all I watch on cable.

1877
02:17:22,734 --> 02:17:24,436
[SPEAKER_04]: So why am I bothering?

1878
02:17:25,296 --> 02:17:26,978
[SPEAKER_04]: Although I will say cable internet is where it's at.

1879
02:17:27,878 --> 02:17:30,881
[SPEAKER_02]: My internet with them has actually gotten way faster recently.

1880
02:17:31,201 --> 02:17:32,001
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I'm getting about...

1881
02:17:34,141 --> 02:17:34,621
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot the sparkles.

1882
02:17:50,194 --> 02:17:53,058
[SPEAKER_04]: I did notice a shit ton of new HD channels.

1883
02:17:53,178 --> 02:17:59,687
[SPEAKER_02]: I watched six hours of Ninja Warrior straight one of these days because I had to wake up with Joshua.

1884
02:18:00,167 --> 02:18:01,970
[SPEAKER_02]: He didn't want to go to sleep and I couldn't change it.

1885
02:18:01,990 --> 02:18:03,271
[SPEAKER_04]: He didn't want to watch Ninja Warrior.

1886
02:18:03,532 --> 02:18:04,393
[SPEAKER_02]: I watched Ninja Warrior.

1887
02:18:04,413 --> 02:18:05,835
[SPEAKER_02]: I watched like three seasons of it.

1888
02:18:06,435 --> 02:18:06,895
[SPEAKER_02]: out over here, but

1889
02:18:35,789 --> 02:18:46,726
[SPEAKER_02]: now not so much just because I don't think I have the Japanese one to compare it to anymore the Japanese Iron Chef with the food TV Julie Chan is a judge a lot on Iron Chef America and I love Julie Chan just saying

1890
02:18:50,050 --> 02:18:51,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, what are we talking about now?

1891
02:18:52,753 --> 02:18:53,533
[SPEAKER_02]: You're ditching cable.

1892
02:18:53,593 --> 02:18:54,614
[SPEAKER_02]: The Doctor Who game.

1893
02:18:54,774 --> 02:18:55,195
[SPEAKER_02]: That was it.

1894
02:18:55,215 --> 02:18:55,875
[SPEAKER_02]: We got to the end of it.

1895
02:18:55,915 --> 02:18:56,916
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's all you, Loki.

1896
02:18:57,376 --> 02:18:57,777
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

1897
02:18:58,137 --> 02:19:00,739
[SPEAKER_02]: It was all these different tangents and I forgot which one.

1898
02:19:00,799 --> 02:19:02,361
[SPEAKER_04]: I see you shopping on eBay over there.

1899
02:19:02,401 --> 02:19:02,841
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all good.

1900
02:19:03,001 --> 02:19:04,042
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know.

1901
02:19:04,723 --> 02:19:05,583
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know what I'm looking for.

1902
02:19:05,603 --> 02:19:06,604
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just looking.

1903
02:19:07,525 --> 02:19:08,226
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's what I do.

1904
02:19:09,147 --> 02:19:13,572
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things that's kind of funny, we were talking a little bit about different systems being hacked.

1905
02:19:14,013 --> 02:19:23,886
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, something else that Microsoft had hoped wouldn't have been hacked, but it was, was the brand new Xbox 360 system, the S Slim, whatever the hell you want to call it.

1906
02:19:24,346 --> 02:19:47,246
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, the mod chip creation group Team Executor has been working closely with Team Jungle, who has created dry firmwares for the original Xbox 360 systems, and Commodore Forever, also responsible for firmwares for those systems and hacking DVD drives.

1907
02:19:48,767 --> 02:19:58,030
[SPEAKER_02]: and now they have figured out a way to be able to patch the DVD-ROM on those new Slim systems to play backups.

1908
02:19:58,330 --> 02:20:03,152
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes, they have now created a new hacked firmware for that.

1909
02:20:06,473 --> 02:20:09,074
[SPEAKER_02]: They just keep trying, but they find ways around it.

1910
02:20:10,634 --> 02:20:13,595
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, if you go online with it, baninated, right?

1911
02:20:14,666 --> 02:20:29,792
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I'm not sure, because I would assume, yes, eventually you'll probably get banned, but the newer firmwares nowadays, they have Light Touch and stuff like that, are apparently really stealthy, like, it's very hard to detect them, so...

1912
02:20:31,312 --> 02:20:31,632
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe?

1913
02:20:32,172 --> 02:20:32,493
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1914
02:20:32,573 --> 02:20:34,053
[SPEAKER_02]: I would assume eventually, yes.

1915
02:20:34,673 --> 02:20:40,276
[SPEAKER_02]: But then again, I have a system at my work that was supposed to be modded, and it hasn't been banned at all.

1916
02:20:40,456 --> 02:20:42,736
[SPEAKER_02]: Then again, we've not played one burned game on it.

1917
02:20:42,877 --> 02:20:48,059
[SPEAKER_02]: We just actually... It's funny, I bought it to replace another modded system, and that's when we decided, hey, you know what?

1918
02:20:48,319 --> 02:20:50,900
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just play some normal Grand Theft Auto games instead of the modded ones.

1919
02:20:51,960 --> 02:20:55,201
[SPEAKER_02]: We will be playing the modded ones again, but we're not modifying our drive firmware.

1920
02:20:55,221 --> 02:20:56,802
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just doing disk swaps so that...

1921
02:20:57,242 --> 02:21:02,571
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if they did detect that we were playing a modded game, when they look at the system, the drive's not modded.

1922
02:21:03,533 --> 02:21:04,254
[SPEAKER_02]: They can't ban me!

1923
02:21:05,255 --> 02:21:09,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they can, but I would have a fighting chance.

1924
02:21:13,266 --> 02:21:13,566
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1925
02:21:14,606 --> 02:21:19,188
[SPEAKER_04]: You haven't had the opportunity to play around with one of the new 360 models, right?

1926
02:21:19,528 --> 02:21:20,428
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really care.

1927
02:21:20,568 --> 02:21:26,530
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's neat that they changed the way it looks, and I like how it makes little noises and stuff when you click on the buttons.

1928
02:21:27,471 --> 02:21:37,094
[SPEAKER_02]: And apparently there's some way... Now they're going to have the new sim system with the Halo stuff, and it's going to have some different sound effects for that.

1929
02:21:37,134 --> 02:21:37,754
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of neat.

1930
02:21:38,294 --> 02:21:39,515
[SPEAKER_02]: But, yeah, I mean...

1931
02:21:40,595 --> 02:21:40,835
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1932
02:21:40,855 --> 02:21:42,396
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like I wouldn't need one of these.

1933
02:21:43,417 --> 02:21:44,818
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know.

1934
02:21:44,838 --> 02:21:47,099
[SPEAKER_02]: If someone gives one to me, I'm not going to turn down.

1935
02:21:48,140 --> 02:21:48,420
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1936
02:21:48,860 --> 02:21:51,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, do you like to cut in line at big trade shows?

1937
02:21:52,182 --> 02:21:57,166
[SPEAKER_04]: Or I guess not necessarily a trade show, but big conventions and have everybody hate you?

1938
02:21:57,886 --> 02:22:01,488
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, here you have your opportunity if you are a member of the Gun Club.

1939
02:22:02,109 --> 02:22:05,591
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Electronic Arts, one of their little promotional clubs.

1940
02:22:05,931 --> 02:22:32,720
[SPEAKER_04]: They actually are running a promotion right now where you got an email And if you want, you can skip the line to see Dead Space 2 at Penny Arcade Expo If you have a copy of the email That's right, you can skip the line with a printout of the email And Penny Arcade Expo is coming up in a couple weeks That same Labor Day weekend that we're thinking of doing a long show And there you go, you print out the email Now, why hasn't somebody just put the email online And then you just mass print it and then go Maybe there's like a barcode on it or something we're not seeing, I don't know

1941
02:22:33,180 --> 02:22:33,620
[SPEAKER_10]: Probably.

1942
02:22:33,821 --> 02:22:35,262
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't think that's the case at all.

1943
02:22:35,282 --> 02:22:39,545
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's just people don't want to do that so that, you know, the line for that is really long.

1944
02:22:39,585 --> 02:22:43,428
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's going to have the same line anyway, you know.

1945
02:22:43,808 --> 02:22:44,348
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

1946
02:22:44,608 --> 02:22:45,389
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what?

1947
02:22:45,509 --> 02:22:49,572
[SPEAKER_02]: And it does suck, but then again, it's their booth space that they paid for.

1948
02:22:49,632 --> 02:22:50,873
[SPEAKER_02]: They can do whatever the hell they want.

1949
02:22:51,013 --> 02:22:53,554
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a strange precedent to be setting.

1950
02:22:54,154 --> 02:23:01,616
[SPEAKER_04]: The only weird oddity about it for me is that, and I made a big mistake calling it a trade show earlier because it's not, but PAX is more of a convention.

1951
02:23:01,816 --> 02:23:05,958
[SPEAKER_04]: And I always thought one of the things that was supposed to kind of separate it is that everybody was on equal footing.

1952
02:23:06,578 --> 02:23:08,418
[SPEAKER_04]: Media doesn't get special treatment there.

1953
02:23:08,458 --> 02:23:11,399
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not supposed to be doing all these media appointments and things.

1954
02:23:11,579 --> 02:23:15,121
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what E3 is for, even though, especially the years that E3 went...

1955
02:23:16,941 --> 02:23:18,001
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

1956
02:23:33,647 --> 02:23:37,389
[SPEAKER_04]: But of course, you know, again, it's this company, their email list, they can do what they want.

1957
02:23:37,429 --> 02:23:39,051
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just trying to pimp the service, the gun club.

1958
02:23:39,071 --> 02:23:42,573
[SPEAKER_02]: They're trying to pimp it to make it have some value so that people can sign up for it.

1959
02:23:42,953 --> 02:23:44,314
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember if it costs anything.

1960
02:23:44,354 --> 02:23:52,979
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's just, I know you, like, for example, if you buy that Battlefield Ultimate, you know, Battlefield Bad Company 2 Ultimate Edition or whatever, you get membership into the gun club.

1961
02:23:53,019 --> 02:23:56,862
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember if it costs anything initially to sign up or whatever.

1962
02:23:57,182 --> 02:24:01,725
[SPEAKER_02]: But you get, like, you know, into the Medal of Honor beta early and stuff like that.

1963
02:24:02,145 --> 02:24:06,988
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's little tidbits of that kind of thing that are supposed to... I guess they're making it worthwhile.

1964
02:24:07,789 --> 02:24:09,850
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know.

1965
02:24:10,030 --> 02:24:10,811
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, they're a booth.

1966
02:24:10,831 --> 02:24:11,811
[SPEAKER_02]: They can do whatever the hell they want.

1967
02:24:12,712 --> 02:24:17,655
[SPEAKER_04]: Toagak in our chatroom at chat.orange.com says, I like the whole we don't care if you are media stuff.

1968
02:24:17,956 --> 02:24:18,856
[SPEAKER_04]: Believe it or not, me too.

1969
02:24:19,477 --> 02:24:20,998
[SPEAKER_04]: And I wish they did the same thing at E3.

1970
02:24:21,418 --> 02:24:28,462
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that sounds weird because I can get media credentials for E3, but I kind of like it when everybody's on the same footing.

1971
02:24:28,482 --> 02:24:28,923
[SPEAKER_04]: But E3, you can't...

1972
02:24:29,343 --> 02:24:33,584
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't see E3 anymore without planning it out six months in advance.

1973
02:24:33,624 --> 02:24:46,368
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if you do get media credentials, it still doesn't matter because they basically look at you, they're like, oh, well, you're not IGN or 1UP or whatever, so we don't know who you are, so we don't care.

1974
02:24:47,668 --> 02:24:48,368
[SPEAKER_02]: So it doesn't matter.

1975
02:24:49,169 --> 02:24:55,070
[SPEAKER_04]: It's because a lot of the marketing people behind video games don't play video games and know nothing about video games.

1976
02:24:55,090 --> 02:24:57,571
[SPEAKER_04]: There's so many of them out there that just don't

1977
02:24:59,117 --> 02:25:00,959
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't even know the product that they're selling.

1978
02:25:01,299 --> 02:25:02,260
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, I know that.

1979
02:25:02,360 --> 02:25:09,787
[SPEAKER_02]: I deal with a lot of corporate sales reps from these companies that are talking about the games coming out, and I start asking them questions about stuff, and they're like, I don't know, I don't play games.

1980
02:25:10,488 --> 02:25:12,930
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, you know, you don't even know your own product?

1981
02:25:12,990 --> 02:25:13,771
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, come on.

1982
02:25:15,873 --> 02:25:16,814
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty astounding.

1983
02:25:17,574 --> 02:25:18,375
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of sad, though.

1984
02:25:20,076 --> 02:25:20,217
[SPEAKER_04]: But...

1985
02:25:20,959 --> 02:25:25,103
[SPEAKER_04]: We just have to support those companies that, you know, know what they're doing.

1986
02:25:25,323 --> 02:25:27,965
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like Konami, they don't like to invite us anymore to things.

1987
02:25:28,025 --> 02:25:30,247
[SPEAKER_02]: But I understand they're not in San Francisco anymore.

1988
02:25:30,627 --> 02:25:31,368
[SPEAKER_02]: But so what?

1989
02:25:31,408 --> 02:25:35,291
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you can at least send the damn invite and if we can't make it, that's not a big deal.

1990
02:25:35,512 --> 02:25:37,433
[SPEAKER_04]: The DDR thing was public and I thought that was great.

1991
02:25:39,255 --> 02:25:39,415
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1992
02:25:39,555 --> 02:25:40,316
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a great way to do it.

1993
02:25:40,536 --> 02:25:40,916
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

1994
02:25:41,177 --> 02:25:42,658
[SPEAKER_04]: Let all the people who really want to see it go see it.

1995
02:25:44,144 --> 02:25:46,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anyhow, let's open up the mailbag.

1996
02:25:47,065 --> 02:25:47,585
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay!

1997
02:25:47,666 --> 02:25:54,348
[SPEAKER_04]: Every week you guys send us emails here at mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com We select a few of our favorites and read them here on air.

1998
02:25:54,628 --> 02:25:59,170
[SPEAKER_04]: Mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com Looks like our mailbag's very full from having a week off.

1999
02:25:59,450 --> 02:26:00,511
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not reading all of them.

2000
02:26:02,652 --> 02:26:04,434
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't be butthurt if you don't get your email read.

2001
02:26:04,614 --> 02:26:13,742
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, if it was one asking us to advertise usernames or asking us about advertising or asking us about those types of things, we'll be replying to you offline.

2002
02:26:14,422 --> 02:26:16,384
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

2003
02:26:16,424 --> 02:26:17,105
[SPEAKER_10]: First one up.

2004
02:26:17,365 --> 02:26:18,746
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't say anything.

2005
02:26:23,430 --> 02:26:27,892
[SPEAKER_10]: Haseo, Sumi, Ragawa, Hay, or Plissken as it was in my last email.

2006
02:26:27,912 --> 02:26:29,333
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, it's a Metal Gear Solid reference.

2007
02:26:30,774 --> 02:26:32,735
[SPEAKER_10]: If Rob still hates Justin Bieber, have him watch this.

2008
02:26:32,835 --> 02:26:33,175
[SPEAKER_10]: Whatever.

2009
02:26:33,796 --> 02:26:34,156
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

2010
02:26:34,636 --> 02:26:36,657
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a video that I haven't pulled up.

2011
02:26:37,378 --> 02:26:40,439
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, everybody's... It's probably him getting hit with a water bottle.

2012
02:26:40,880 --> 02:26:40,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.

2013
02:26:42,060 --> 02:26:43,601
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw the keyboard cat version of that.

2014
02:26:43,921 --> 02:26:44,141
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

2015
02:26:44,722 --> 02:26:47,443
[SPEAKER_10]: And DarkSakura, if you still love Doctor Who, I have a video for you.

2016
02:26:47,543 --> 02:26:48,984
[SPEAKER_10]: And I pulled it up and I'll watch it later.

2017
02:26:49,044 --> 02:26:50,685
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the Mighty Morphin Dalek Rangers.

2018
02:26:52,273 --> 02:27:02,163
[SPEAKER_10]: And on to non-Bieber stuff, um, okay, I tried to download a shady copy of Bleach Heat The Soul 6 for a Japanese game site, but for some reason it keeps saying corrupted or unsupported data.

2019
02:27:02,264 --> 02:27:03,004
[SPEAKER_10]: Any suggestions?

2020
02:27:03,745 --> 02:27:04,366
[SPEAKER_10]: Punctuation?

2021
02:27:04,666 --> 02:27:05,767
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, no, I'm kidding.

2022
02:27:06,148 --> 02:27:11,874
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, I would say, um, check your region.

2023
02:27:12,474 --> 02:27:12,655
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

2024
02:27:13,355 --> 02:27:13,896
[SPEAKER_02]: What was the question?

2025
02:27:14,833 --> 02:27:20,504
[SPEAKER_10]: It downloaded a copy of Bleach Hate the Soul 6 from a Japanese game site.

2026
02:27:21,345 --> 02:27:23,469
[SPEAKER_10]: But it says corrupted or unsupported data.

2027
02:27:24,050 --> 02:27:26,114
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that through an emulator or through a console?

2028
02:27:26,335 --> 02:27:26,916
[SPEAKER_10]: It didn't say.

2029
02:27:28,311 --> 02:27:29,092
[SPEAKER_10]: He downloaded it?

2030
02:27:29,372 --> 02:27:30,393
[SPEAKER_10]: Give us more details, dude.

2031
02:27:30,413 --> 02:27:31,433
[SPEAKER_14]: You get what you pay for.

2032
02:27:33,975 --> 02:27:34,836
[SPEAKER_02]: Redownload it.

2033
02:27:35,016 --> 02:27:35,416
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

2034
02:27:35,516 --> 02:27:40,019
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's a PC game, then it sounds like it's just a corrupted download and you have to redownload it.

2035
02:27:40,400 --> 02:27:47,825
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're downloading a pirated version of a game of some sort, perhaps you need to burn it at a lower speed.

2036
02:27:48,185 --> 02:27:52,868
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're pirating a current game, I don't think we can really help you.

2037
02:27:53,028 --> 02:27:54,950
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not supposed to be doing that naughty-naughty.

2038
02:27:55,390 --> 02:27:59,493
[SPEAKER_04]: If this is a game I don't recognize from like 10, 15 years ago, they don't make anymore.

2039
02:27:59,513 --> 02:28:00,274
[SPEAKER_10]: It's relatively new.

2040
02:28:00,294 --> 02:28:00,834
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Bleach.

2041
02:28:01,034 --> 02:28:02,976
[SPEAKER_04]: Well then, we can't help you.

2042
02:28:03,516 --> 02:28:04,557
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a PC game.

2043
02:28:04,597 --> 02:28:05,758
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like it's a PC game.

2044
02:28:06,799 --> 02:28:09,281
[SPEAKER_04]: If you bought it legitimately, then call the people who made the game.

2045
02:28:09,301 --> 02:28:10,121
[SPEAKER_04]: They can answer.

2046
02:28:11,082 --> 02:28:11,802
[SPEAKER_10]: He said shady.

2047
02:28:13,023 --> 02:28:13,624
[SPEAKER_04]: Naughty, naughty.

2048
02:28:13,904 --> 02:28:17,106
[SPEAKER_10]: And third, I would like to thank Rob for his advice on an earlier episode.

2049
02:28:17,187 --> 02:28:17,867
[SPEAKER_10]: What you said helped.

2050
02:28:17,907 --> 02:28:20,349
[SPEAKER_10]: I told my friend, but not family for certain reasons.

2051
02:28:20,749 --> 02:28:22,090
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm currently dating someone.

2052
02:28:22,210 --> 02:28:22,891
[SPEAKER_10]: Once again, thanks.

2053
02:28:23,610 --> 02:28:25,250
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm glad to hear things worked out.

2054
02:28:25,751 --> 02:28:27,951
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember that email.

2055
02:28:28,111 --> 02:28:29,072
[SPEAKER_04]: So, good.

2056
02:28:29,152 --> 02:28:30,072
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really, really glad to hear it.

2057
02:28:31,252 --> 02:28:32,873
[SPEAKER_10]: And thank you, DarkSakura, for reading my email.

2058
02:28:32,913 --> 02:28:34,013
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you didn't, what the hell?

2059
02:28:34,193 --> 02:28:34,753
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, fine.

2060
02:28:34,793 --> 02:28:35,133
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

2061
02:28:35,713 --> 02:28:38,954
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks, as always, your loyal listener, Haseo Sumirogawa.

2062
02:28:40,054 --> 02:28:41,975
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I'm very glad.

2063
02:28:41,995 --> 02:28:44,816
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope my headache hasn't made me too grumpy when reading it.

2064
02:28:45,916 --> 02:28:46,776
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, good lord.

2065
02:28:48,657 --> 02:28:49,737
[SPEAKER_10]: Long email!

2066
02:28:52,150 --> 02:28:53,210
[SPEAKER_10]: Helping Ake Ripper.

2067
02:28:53,750 --> 02:28:55,751
[SPEAKER_10]: Might be the longest mail in OLR history.

2068
02:28:56,211 --> 02:28:57,111
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, it might be.

2069
02:28:58,711 --> 02:29:01,412
[SPEAKER_10]: Good morning everyone, this is the other Swede, Jiditz, writing in.

2070
02:29:02,052 --> 02:29:07,653
[SPEAKER_10]: I usually rant about something or comment on things that were brought up during the last live show, but not this time.

2071
02:29:08,413 --> 02:29:15,055
[SPEAKER_10]: During episode 376, which is the show before the previous one, Ake Ripper called in and told us of his angst and how Blizzard had wronged him.

2072
02:29:15,795 --> 02:29:30,460
[SPEAKER_10]: seeing as that episode went up kind of late I didn't have time to listen to the episode before the next one aired and couldn't share my knowledge and experience when it comes to activating and playing Starcraft 2 all that is about to change so hold on to your socks and put your pants back on because it's what?

2073
02:29:31,120 --> 02:29:36,522
[SPEAKER_10]: because it's time for a story of epic proportions fills the brim with angst I have to put my pants back on?

2074
02:29:38,462 --> 02:29:43,164
[SPEAKER_10]: yeah because Rob's been sitting here pantsless the whole time I'm comfortable

2075
02:29:43,996 --> 02:29:51,698
[SPEAKER_10]: Twas the morning of the 27th of July and the first thing I heard was the blaring of my alarm clock proclaiming it was the time for me to get up had approached.

2076
02:29:53,158 --> 02:29:53,638
[SPEAKER_10]: Excuse me.

2077
02:29:55,078 --> 02:29:56,099
[SPEAKER_10]: Didn't mean to do that.

2078
02:29:56,259 --> 02:29:56,819
[SPEAKER_10]: Whatever.

2079
02:29:57,579 --> 02:30:03,820
[SPEAKER_10]: With slow steps, I went up to the kitchen to prepare my breakfast, which on this specific day consists of two slices of toast and a cup of coffee.

2080
02:30:04,380 --> 02:30:06,621
[SPEAKER_10]: The perfect combination of breakfast items, if you ask me.

2081
02:30:07,061 --> 02:30:12,522
[SPEAKER_10]: After gulping down my coffee, I went to feed Gullen, my polar bear cub, and then... Polar...

2082
02:30:13,122 --> 02:30:14,524
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, get to the point.

2083
02:30:14,604 --> 02:30:17,686
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I appreciated the storytelling, but... Hold on.

2084
02:30:18,187 --> 02:30:19,768
[SPEAKER_10]: And then proceeded to get ready to leave the house.

2085
02:30:20,228 --> 02:30:24,672
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, you may think I went up early to stand in line to get my copy of StarCraft II, but you were sorely mistaken.

2086
02:30:25,093 --> 02:30:29,296
[SPEAKER_10]: You see, during the summer break, I managed to acquire an ingrown nail on my big toe on both my feet.

2087
02:30:29,696 --> 02:30:29,857
[SPEAKER_10]: Ow.

2088
02:30:30,337 --> 02:30:36,803
[SPEAKER_10]: This made walking overall quite painful, so I promptly got in touch with my doctor, who had a spot open during the 27th of July, StarCraft II day.

2089
02:30:37,663 --> 02:30:45,510
[SPEAKER_10]: After a swift drive to the doctor's office and later an extra 20 minutes of waiting, I finally get placed atop one of those odd beds they have at the hospital and the doctor arrives.

2090
02:30:45,850 --> 02:30:46,011
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh lord.

2091
02:30:46,031 --> 02:30:47,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie Summers is not your LiveJournal client?

2092
02:31:03,426 --> 02:31:04,087
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm not.

2093
02:31:04,107 --> 02:31:08,013
[SPEAKER_10]: And I feel really bad about your ingrown toenails, dude.

2094
02:31:08,895 --> 02:31:09,436
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

2095
02:31:12,481 --> 02:31:13,222
[SPEAKER_04]: Get a live journal.

2096
02:31:13,262 --> 02:31:16,207
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Alan's making a really good point there.

2097
02:31:17,853 --> 02:31:19,855
[SPEAKER_14]: I feel like an ass now, I'm sorry, that was really mean.

2098
02:31:19,875 --> 02:31:24,280
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I mean, I'm just, I'm not trying to be rude, but it's a three hour show, not ten.

2099
02:31:25,121 --> 02:31:27,383
[SPEAKER_04]: We could read this email during the Labor Day show.

2100
02:31:27,463 --> 02:31:30,266
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm gonna read what I want to read out of it.

2101
02:31:30,687 --> 02:31:30,927
[SPEAKER_04]: Fine.

2102
02:31:31,247 --> 02:31:34,231
[SPEAKER_10]: After all the crap with the doctor, paraphrasing of course,

2103
02:31:36,468 --> 02:31:38,209
[SPEAKER_10]: I wondered how I could get the damn game.

2104
02:31:38,650 --> 02:31:40,952
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought I could get it at home, so I went home.

2105
02:31:41,352 --> 02:31:42,973
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm paraphrasing now, okay?

2106
02:31:43,354 --> 02:31:43,714
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2107
02:31:45,335 --> 02:31:55,724
[SPEAKER_10]: He turned it on, started Firefox, pulled out the credit card, and then Blizzard wanted him to pay 60 euros, which is about 589.80 Swedish kronor, which is 77 bucks for the digital purpose.

2108
02:31:55,744 --> 02:31:58,166
[SPEAKER_10]: At the local store, it's 399 kronor, which is 52 dollars.

2109
02:32:05,211 --> 02:32:10,217
[SPEAKER_10]: So, um, to buy a physical copy, it cost him 20 bucks cheaper to go get the physical copy.

2110
02:32:10,718 --> 02:32:11,259
[SPEAKER_10]: So he did that.

2111
02:32:12,360 --> 02:32:13,521
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, blah blah blah blah blah.

2112
02:32:15,223 --> 02:32:17,787
[SPEAKER_10]: Gonna install it, gonna play, no.

2113
02:32:18,668 --> 02:32:22,112
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, now this is where I'm gonna read the email again, because I'm pretty down into it now.

2114
02:32:22,762 --> 02:32:23,583
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

2115
02:32:46,938 --> 02:32:52,582
[SPEAKER_10]: I emailed Blizzard support explaining my problem, what I had tried, and that I would love some information on what I was doing wrong.

2116
02:32:52,622 --> 02:33:00,128
[SPEAKER_10]: Within six hours, I'd gotten a reply that said they had fixed the problem, and the following attempt to play StarCraft II was successful, and it was beautiful.

2117
02:33:01,529 --> 02:33:08,414
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, story time is over, but this email isn't, so straighten up your backs and get ready for GDOT's indie game of the century.

2118
02:33:10,076 --> 02:33:10,656
[SPEAKER_10]: There's codes.

2119
02:33:11,136 --> 02:33:11,757
[SPEAKER_10]: There's codes.

2120
02:33:13,596 --> 02:33:14,477
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, sweet, codes?

2121
02:33:15,297 --> 02:33:17,999
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, are we supposed to read the entire email and then let the codes for the reward?

2122
02:33:18,019 --> 02:33:20,620
[SPEAKER_04]: Oops, I've been giving this guy a hard time.

2123
02:33:20,660 --> 02:33:23,442
[SPEAKER_04]: ToyGakInChatRoom says, Control-F, point.

2124
02:33:30,914 --> 02:33:39,580
[SPEAKER_10]: My friend who happens to be the developer finishes Xbox indie game Seaside Racing a couple weeks ago and is now up for sale on Xbox Live Marketplace for only 80 Microsoft points.

2125
02:33:40,040 --> 02:33:49,927
[SPEAKER_10]: Seaside Racing is a stylistic physics-based kart racer made by a single person and this currently features three maps, Xbox avatar implementation, and up to 8-player multiplayer.

2126
02:33:50,427 --> 02:33:51,348
[SPEAKER_10]: There's trailers up here.

2127
02:33:51,928 --> 02:33:52,829
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll link it in the chat room.

2128
02:33:55,531 --> 02:33:57,172
[SPEAKER_10]: He has four codes to give away.

2129
02:33:58,213 --> 02:34:02,776
[SPEAKER_10]: So we are going to be giving away codes later on.

2130
02:34:03,016 --> 02:34:06,219
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we'll post them on Twitter and Facebook to some fans later in the week.

2131
02:34:07,300 --> 02:34:09,581
[SPEAKER_10]: I will actually save this email then.

2132
02:34:11,243 --> 02:34:12,504
[SPEAKER_04]: But I might keep a code for myself.

2133
02:34:14,338 --> 02:34:14,938
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll play it.

2134
02:34:15,298 --> 02:34:17,339
[SPEAKER_10]: Big thanks to DarkSakura for reading this long email.

2135
02:34:17,479 --> 02:34:18,099
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, kind of.

2136
02:34:19,220 --> 02:34:19,420
[SPEAKER_10]: Oops.

2137
02:34:19,480 --> 02:34:22,281
[SPEAKER_10]: It's actually just over a thousand words and thanks to the rest of our crew.

2138
02:34:22,321 --> 02:34:23,902
[SPEAKER_10]: I promise my next email won't be this long.

2139
02:34:23,982 --> 02:34:24,522
[SPEAKER_10]: P.S.S.

2140
02:34:24,562 --> 02:34:25,582
[SPEAKER_10]: The polar bear wasn't real.

2141
02:34:25,982 --> 02:34:27,143
[SPEAKER_10]: This is Jeedit signing off.

2142
02:34:27,523 --> 02:34:32,105
[SPEAKER_10]: To tell you a story, Jeedit, I would have believed the polar bear and I'll tell you why.

2143
02:34:33,785 --> 02:34:38,847
[SPEAKER_10]: When Lord Byron, you know, the poet, went to college, he was not allowed to have a dog.

2144
02:34:38,887 --> 02:34:40,828
[SPEAKER_10]: The rules were no dogs allowed on campus.

2145
02:34:41,528 --> 02:34:42,989
[SPEAKER_10]: But it did not say anything about a bear.

2146
02:34:43,959 --> 02:34:44,820
[SPEAKER_10]: So he had a pet bear.

2147
02:34:46,221 --> 02:34:47,161
[SPEAKER_10]: I think when he went to Cambridge.

2148
02:34:48,162 --> 02:34:48,602
[SPEAKER_10]: True story.

2149
02:34:48,823 --> 02:34:49,343
[SPEAKER_10]: True facts.

2150
02:34:51,605 --> 02:34:53,246
[SPEAKER_09]: So the polar bear could have been possible.

2151
02:34:53,746 --> 02:34:55,848
[SPEAKER_14]: I wanted to know what kind of toothpaste he used.

2152
02:34:56,108 --> 02:35:00,772
[SPEAKER_14]: I could have used what type of magazines in the doctor's office.

2153
02:35:02,253 --> 02:35:04,014
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't think your email was detailed enough.

2154
02:35:04,334 --> 02:35:07,677
[SPEAKER_04]: I couldn't really get a sense of the situation.

2155
02:35:09,678 --> 02:35:10,739
[SPEAKER_04]: And dire urgency.

2156
02:35:10,759 --> 02:35:10,839
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

2157
02:35:12,631 --> 02:35:14,274
[SPEAKER_10]: I moved it to the inbox.

2158
02:35:14,495 --> 02:35:17,541
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad to hear that emailing Blizzard support was a great option.

2159
02:35:18,743 --> 02:35:21,989
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to say though, like you could have condensed that down to Twitter size.

2160
02:35:22,450 --> 02:35:24,194
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell Ake Ripper to email them.

2161
02:35:26,681 --> 02:35:27,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Move to inbox.

2162
02:35:27,922 --> 02:35:28,622
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's some codes.

2163
02:35:29,822 --> 02:35:30,483
[SPEAKER_04]: Just saying.

2164
02:35:31,643 --> 02:35:33,104
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm giving this poor guy a hard time.

2165
02:35:33,324 --> 02:35:33,624
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

2166
02:35:33,644 --> 02:35:35,025
[SPEAKER_04]: We do appreciate the email.

2167
02:35:35,405 --> 02:35:35,845
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

2168
02:35:35,865 --> 02:35:36,605
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

2169
02:35:36,625 --> 02:35:37,646
[SPEAKER_10]: I paraphrased.

2170
02:35:37,766 --> 02:35:38,206
[SPEAKER_04]: I promise.

2171
02:35:38,306 --> 02:35:40,107
[SPEAKER_10]: I did read it and it was entertaining.

2172
02:35:40,887 --> 02:35:41,468
[SPEAKER_10]: That's true.

2173
02:35:41,828 --> 02:35:42,688
[SPEAKER_10]: I want a polar bear now.

2174
02:35:43,608 --> 02:35:44,729
[SPEAKER_10]: That's going to replace the pony.

2175
02:35:46,553 --> 02:35:49,295
[SPEAKER_10]: You know when I go to a restaurant and someone says, is there anything else you'd like?

2176
02:35:49,515 --> 02:35:50,496
[SPEAKER_10]: I say, a pony.

2177
02:35:50,837 --> 02:35:51,817
[SPEAKER_10]: Now I'm going to say a polar bear.

2178
02:35:51,937 --> 02:35:52,318
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

2179
02:35:52,418 --> 02:35:54,640
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, because one time you ended up getting a coney.

2180
02:35:55,040 --> 02:35:57,722
[SPEAKER_04]: When you asked for a pony, the waitress brought you a coney dog.

2181
02:35:58,103 --> 02:35:59,083
[SPEAKER_04]: And I laughed.

2182
02:35:59,884 --> 02:36:01,245
[SPEAKER_09]: I took it home to Dan, though, and he ate it.

2183
02:36:01,305 --> 02:36:02,426
[SPEAKER_04]: And you totally felt guilty.

2184
02:36:02,466 --> 02:36:06,349
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, the waitress was going to take it back going, oh, you were trying to be funny.

2185
02:36:07,050 --> 02:36:07,790
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I see.

2186
02:36:08,131 --> 02:36:09,252
[SPEAKER_09]: People usually do laugh.

2187
02:36:09,272 --> 02:36:09,772
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

2188
02:36:11,428 --> 02:36:13,891
[SPEAKER_04]: Blame the Sonic intercom speaker.

2189
02:36:14,871 --> 02:36:17,354
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, one of the Sonics in Roseville closed, just so you know.

2190
02:36:17,714 --> 02:36:21,138
[SPEAKER_10]: I know the one that was built into the... What's up with that?

2191
02:36:22,082 --> 02:36:23,123
[SPEAKER_04]: Where was the other one?

2192
02:36:23,403 --> 02:36:34,328
[SPEAKER_04]: There's one over on, I mean, I'm sure our international listeners, especially those like in Sweden and Mexico really appreciate this talk, but I think it's over on like Paradise Grove or whatever that street's called.

2193
02:36:35,048 --> 02:36:37,089
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I'm talking about?

2194
02:36:37,889 --> 02:36:38,029
[SPEAKER_04]: Off 65?

2195
02:36:38,070 --> 02:36:38,370
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

2196
02:36:38,550 --> 02:36:42,151
[SPEAKER_04]: Go up 65 and there's like a Pleasant Grove.

2197
02:36:42,271 --> 02:36:42,652
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

2198
02:36:42,972 --> 02:36:43,592
[SPEAKER_04]: Pleasant Grove.

2199
02:36:43,612 --> 02:36:44,392
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I've been to that one.

2200
02:36:44,853 --> 02:36:45,373
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where it is.

2201
02:36:46,854 --> 02:36:47,534
[SPEAKER_04]: Over by Walmart.

2202
02:36:48,757 --> 02:36:50,380
[SPEAKER_10]: by Walmart.

2203
02:36:50,500 --> 02:36:51,121
[SPEAKER_04]: We went there once.

2204
02:36:51,141 --> 02:36:52,744
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was the first day you ever met Alan.

2205
02:36:53,966 --> 02:36:54,587
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, it was.

2206
02:36:55,048 --> 02:36:56,951
[SPEAKER_10]: And we had tater tots and it was magical.

2207
02:36:58,694 --> 02:36:59,215
[SPEAKER_10]: Next up!

2208
02:37:00,444 --> 02:37:03,325
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey guys, this is... I'm not going to read your name.

2209
02:37:03,365 --> 02:37:03,746
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, dude.

2210
02:37:03,766 --> 02:37:04,746
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't care if you put your name in there.

2211
02:37:04,786 --> 02:37:05,326
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not reading it.

2212
02:37:05,727 --> 02:37:06,407
[SPEAKER_10]: Kidwhatever.

2213
02:37:07,007 --> 02:37:08,708
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been a while since I've talked to you.

2214
02:37:08,788 --> 02:37:18,193
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure if you've kept up on the money-related music activities I've been doing, but I have some new releases on Discord Music that I think you'll want to post about.

2215
02:37:18,213 --> 02:37:21,094
[SPEAKER_10]: So please get back to me with an email address where I can send you some press material.

2216
02:37:21,735 --> 02:37:22,595
[SPEAKER_04]: Pimp my music.

2217
02:37:25,617 --> 02:37:26,097
[SPEAKER_10]: Send them here.

2218
02:37:27,608 --> 02:37:28,908
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to email him to do that.

2219
02:37:28,988 --> 02:37:31,889
[SPEAKER_04]: He's probably not actually listening to the show.

2220
02:37:32,949 --> 02:37:33,510
[SPEAKER_04]: Was he on it?

2221
02:37:33,530 --> 02:37:35,350
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't we have him on years and years ago?

2222
02:37:35,570 --> 02:37:37,491
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but he's probably listening.

2223
02:37:37,891 --> 02:37:38,291
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, hi.

2224
02:37:38,471 --> 02:37:40,812
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, dude, if you're listening, email.

2225
02:37:43,912 --> 02:37:47,413
[SPEAKER_10]: Troy, just sent a simple message.

2226
02:37:47,953 --> 02:37:49,854
[SPEAKER_10]: Dan plus OLR equals awesome.

2227
02:37:50,474 --> 02:37:51,714
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's not inflate Dan's ego too much.

2228
02:37:51,735 --> 02:37:53,335
[SPEAKER_10]: He's not here anyway, so I ain't gonna tell him.

2229
02:37:54,904 --> 02:37:55,444
[SPEAKER_10]: Stop it!

2230
02:37:55,604 --> 02:37:58,066
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm trying to keep him in his place.

2231
02:37:59,246 --> 02:38:00,507
[SPEAKER_10]: And you are inflating his ego.

2232
02:38:00,547 --> 02:38:03,228
[SPEAKER_04]: We need some DanSucks emails, is what we need.

2233
02:38:03,288 --> 02:38:04,409
[SPEAKER_04]: We need him to get some hate mail.

2234
02:38:04,449 --> 02:38:05,609
[SPEAKER_10]: No, because then I'll cry.

2235
02:38:05,669 --> 02:38:06,710
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody gets hate mail.

2236
02:38:06,770 --> 02:38:07,450
[SPEAKER_10]: I married him.

2237
02:38:07,950 --> 02:38:09,691
[SPEAKER_04]: Only I'm allowed to say he sucks.

2238
02:38:10,011 --> 02:38:10,311
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

2239
02:38:10,391 --> 02:38:11,932
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to write an email to the show right now.

2240
02:38:11,952 --> 02:38:12,012
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob.

2241
02:38:12,052 --> 02:38:12,212
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob.

2242
02:38:12,232 --> 02:38:12,292
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob.

2243
02:38:12,312 --> 02:38:12,372
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob.

2244
02:38:12,392 --> 02:38:13,273
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob.

2245
02:38:13,293 --> 02:38:13,453

02:38:22,397 --> 02:38:22,457
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob.

2309
02:38:24,714 --> 02:38:25,344
[SPEAKER_10]: Ooh, this is cool.

2310
02:38:25,364 --> 02:38:25,993
[SPEAKER_10]: It's from Roboba.

2311
02:38:27,628 --> 02:38:28,909
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's actually someone I'm a fan of.

2312
02:38:29,649 --> 02:38:33,571
[SPEAKER_10]: Writer Peter David posted on his blog that he is writing the Tron comic book.

2313
02:38:34,191 --> 02:38:36,732
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure if it will be released as a graphic novel.

2314
02:38:37,152 --> 02:38:41,054
[SPEAKER_10]: It probably will as it catches up on the story behind Tron Legacy.

2315
02:38:41,514 --> 02:38:43,735
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not a fanboy much, but I am a Tron fanboy.

2316
02:38:43,955 --> 02:38:48,737
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually like Peter David and I've read some of his Star Trek novels.

2317
02:38:50,258 --> 02:38:52,279
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think he wrote the novelization for Iron Man.

2318
02:38:53,319 --> 02:38:56,461
[SPEAKER_10]: So it was... I like his writing a lot, so...

2319
02:38:57,003 --> 02:38:57,424
[SPEAKER_04]: Tron 3D Preview

2320
02:39:14,622 --> 02:39:16,403
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't quite make that noise, but close.

2321
02:39:17,063 --> 02:39:17,783
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that it for emails?

2322
02:39:17,943 --> 02:39:18,123
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

2323
02:39:18,563 --> 02:39:18,703
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

2324
02:39:18,803 --> 02:39:20,724
[SPEAKER_10]: Like I said, we have a bunch, and I'm only reading a few.

2325
02:39:20,864 --> 02:39:21,124
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2326
02:39:21,964 --> 02:39:22,804
[SPEAKER_10]: Another one from Robaba.

2327
02:39:23,364 --> 02:39:26,885
[SPEAKER_10]: Now that Microsoft announced Windows Phone 7, a near random thought came to mind.

2328
02:39:27,245 --> 02:39:29,046
[SPEAKER_10]: Is Game Room meant for the mobile phone?

2329
02:39:29,806 --> 02:39:32,967
[SPEAKER_10]: It also has a heavy emphasis on games in your live account.

2330
02:39:33,427 --> 02:39:38,188
[SPEAKER_10]: I think they are smart to do this, since games would be one of the few things to rope people in.

2331
02:39:38,249 --> 02:39:39,329
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, they actually...

2332
02:39:40,409 --> 02:39:43,152
[SPEAKER_10]: What was Microsoft's, the Zune?

2333
02:39:44,393 --> 02:39:48,957
[SPEAKER_10]: Weren't they supposed to have had Zune integration for Xbox Live?

2334
02:39:49,077 --> 02:39:52,340
[SPEAKER_04]: Indie games, I think it was a rumor a while back that X and A would play on the Zune too.

2335
02:39:52,400 --> 02:39:56,544
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember that thing at E3 where we sat on the big floor with the subwoofer built into it?

2336
02:39:56,944 --> 02:39:57,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes.

2337
02:39:57,224 --> 02:39:59,666
[SPEAKER_10]: And it vibrated your butt every time the bass would go loud?

2338
02:39:59,706 --> 02:39:59,987
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

2339
02:40:00,127 --> 02:40:03,690
[SPEAKER_10]: And they had the phone integration thing and people pulling them around?

2340
02:40:04,270 --> 02:40:04,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, sort of.

2341
02:40:04,631 --> 02:40:05,311
[SPEAKER_04]: For their big pitch?

2342
02:40:05,331 --> 02:40:05,832
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.

2343
02:40:07,585 --> 02:40:14,007
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't remember what it was called, but I guess Microsoft released a smartphone that came and went in like three months.

2344
02:40:14,387 --> 02:40:15,567
[SPEAKER_14]: I posted it out on my Facebook.

2345
02:40:15,728 --> 02:40:16,388
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember that?

2346
02:40:16,588 --> 02:40:17,968
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that this Windows phone?

2347
02:40:20,069 --> 02:40:25,910
[SPEAKER_14]: It had a very specific brand name, like a Zune, obviously, but that's their music player.

2348
02:40:26,271 --> 02:40:27,471
[SPEAKER_14]: But there was a Microsoft phone...

2349
02:40:29,275 --> 02:40:30,415
[SPEAKER_14]: that was out for two months.

2350
02:40:30,516 --> 02:40:31,396
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd never even heard of it.

2351
02:40:31,416 --> 02:40:33,357
[SPEAKER_14]: And they're like, oh, this is... Oh, the kin.

2352
02:40:33,677 --> 02:40:34,437
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that's it.

2353
02:40:34,477 --> 02:40:34,857
[SPEAKER_14]: That's it.

2354
02:40:35,057 --> 02:40:35,677
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember this.

2355
02:40:35,778 --> 02:40:39,659
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, they had the girl on Facebook going around and meeting people and people were like, who the fuck are you?

2356
02:40:40,559 --> 02:40:40,799
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

2357
02:40:41,920 --> 02:40:42,180
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway.

2358
02:40:43,841 --> 02:40:45,761
[SPEAKER_10]: Ooh, a hard question.

2359
02:40:47,082 --> 02:40:47,162
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

2360
02:40:47,182 --> 02:40:47,382
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay.

2361
02:40:49,605 --> 02:40:53,309
[SPEAKER_10]: Wheel of Morality, turn, turn, turn, tell us the lesson that we should learn.

2362
02:41:10,831 --> 02:41:15,914
[SPEAKER_10]: and today's moral is early to rise and early to bed may make a man wise but socially dead.

2363
02:41:17,636 --> 02:41:18,796
[SPEAKER_04]: Read the damn email.

2364
02:41:19,377 --> 02:41:23,179
[SPEAKER_10]: And as long as I've got some good time out of it I'm fine paying that.

2365
02:41:23,540 --> 02:41:26,962
[SPEAKER_10]: Now I won't lie and say I haven't gotten some games by other means either.

2366
02:41:27,482 --> 02:41:36,969
[SPEAKER_10]: Now to my problem I've recently bought a PS3 and am appalled that there isn't fire and blood protesting at these $60 price points for games.

2367
02:41:37,709 --> 02:41:40,231
[SPEAKER_10]: As game companies whine when their games don't make tons of profit.

2368
02:41:41,472 --> 02:41:47,457
[SPEAKER_10]: You know as well as I do that when Steam puts a game up for 50% off sale, it sells like hotcakes and the developer makes money.

2369
02:41:47,957 --> 02:41:51,941
[SPEAKER_10]: Has there been any PS3 game developers that put their game up for 40 to 50 bucks?

2370
02:41:52,441 --> 02:41:56,004
[SPEAKER_10]: I wonder if they would sell more and thus make more.

2371
02:41:57,529 --> 02:42:11,989
[SPEAKER_04]: 3D.GameHeroes was $39.99 maybe $49.99 but it was in that price range you talk about there I believe in America it sold $150k which isn't terrible but I don't know if it'll have a sequel

2372
02:42:12,889 --> 02:42:13,830
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually for an Atlus game that's really good.

2373
02:42:13,850 --> 02:42:20,874
[SPEAKER_02]: But it also came out around the same time as Lost Planet 2, Escape 3, Red Dead Redemption, Split Second Blur.

2374
02:42:21,194 --> 02:42:23,195
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is also one game.

2375
02:42:23,555 --> 02:42:25,596
[SPEAKER_04]: And I can't think of a whole lot that were cheaper.

2376
02:42:25,636 --> 02:42:27,077
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess Super Street Fighter 2 was cheaper.

2377
02:42:27,637 --> 02:42:28,678
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

2378
02:42:28,738 --> 02:42:33,541
[SPEAKER_04]: It was also an upgrade to a game that you'd already paid $60 for before.

2379
02:42:34,464 --> 02:42:38,868
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, now he's saying, I've included a link to the new PS3 USB hack that might be real.

2380
02:42:38,888 --> 02:42:39,868
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, we covered it earlier.

2381
02:42:40,409 --> 02:42:44,132
[SPEAKER_10]: And to be truthful, at $60 a game, it is a little tempting.

2382
02:42:44,152 --> 02:42:45,172
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you guys think about it?

2383
02:42:45,653 --> 02:42:46,954
[SPEAKER_10]: Your loyal turtle in Philly?

2384
02:42:47,054 --> 02:42:47,654
[SPEAKER_10]: Serious turtle.

2385
02:42:51,477 --> 02:42:52,077
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2386
02:43:09,168 --> 02:43:10,589
[SPEAKER_04]: 10-15 years ago without inflation.

2387
02:43:32,034 --> 02:43:36,275
[SPEAKER_04]: So by the time the PlayStation 1, PlayStation 2 era came around, they actually dropped in price quite a bit.

2388
02:43:36,715 --> 02:43:38,976
[SPEAKER_04]: But now they're slowly climbing back up to where they used to be.

2389
02:43:39,916 --> 02:43:42,456
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that I'm necessarily saying it's justified, because you're right.

2390
02:43:42,476 --> 02:43:46,697
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of crap out there for $60 that really shouldn't be.

2391
02:43:47,037 --> 02:43:50,938
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, what was I saying about the marketing people behind video games earlier?

2392
02:43:51,559 --> 02:43:53,899
[SPEAKER_04]: That many of them... They don't play games.

2393
02:43:53,919 --> 02:43:55,159
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, they don't play the games.

2394
02:43:55,639 --> 02:43:57,560
[SPEAKER_04]: So everything to them is gold.

2395
02:43:59,161 --> 02:44:09,073
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that gaming fandom at large, or at least this is how the corporations have kind of treated gaming fandom, is that they're very fickle and they have a very short attention span.

2396
02:44:09,374 --> 02:44:12,798
[SPEAKER_14]: Once a game is older than three months, no one cares.

2397
02:44:13,098 --> 02:44:16,462
[SPEAKER_14]: Like remember when I said buy StarCraft 2 six months after it comes out?

2398
02:44:17,223 --> 02:44:37,152
[SPEAKER_14]: and it's like well no one's everyone's gonna have moved on by then you have to charge your 60 bucks because once the game is three months old if you haven't made your money back by then it's paying for hype no one's gonna care it's kind of like a movie though right movies are very similar if you don't make your box office back in several weeks then direct to DVD when everyone else buys it it becomes a cool hit yeah

2399
02:44:38,908 --> 02:44:58,492
[SPEAKER_14]: so I think it has a lot to do with the analysts and like their margins of if this game doesn't sell this much past six weeks or whatever their benchmark is then yeah so they charge you 60 bucks for it people who don't play video games are ruining the gaming industry alright I have one last email

2400
02:44:59,960 --> 02:45:00,300
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you ready?

2401
02:45:00,621 --> 02:45:00,821
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

2402
02:45:01,161 --> 02:45:03,663
[SPEAKER_10]: From Butcher.

2403
02:45:04,564 --> 02:45:11,130
[SPEAKER_10]: Yo guys, I just recently got hooked on your show and I was very sad to not hear your angelic, LOL, voices last week.

2404
02:45:11,770 --> 02:45:22,760
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, I'm emailing you wondering if you have any good PSP titles that you could suggest to me and other listeners as I am slowly getting tired of Monster Hunter 2, Dissidia, and Fireteam Bravo.

2405
02:45:23,400 --> 02:45:24,181
[SPEAKER_10]: Two thirds, I guess?

2406
02:45:24,401 --> 02:45:24,481
[SPEAKER_10]: Um...

2407
02:45:25,442 --> 02:45:29,451
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll honestly go for almost anything aside from sports games, ew.

2408
02:45:29,912 --> 02:45:33,279
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks, and may the flying spaghetti monster bless you, Pro Butcher, a.k.a.

2409
02:45:33,639 --> 02:45:34,040
[SPEAKER_04]: Raw Men.

2410
02:45:34,080 --> 02:45:34,421
[SPEAKER_10]: Somebody.

2411
02:45:35,563 --> 02:45:35,984
[SPEAKER_10]: Raw Men.

2412
02:45:38,311 --> 02:45:39,392
[SPEAKER_04]: All hail his noodley goodness.

2413
02:45:40,052 --> 02:45:41,613
[SPEAKER_04]: What was I going to say?

2414
02:45:43,514 --> 02:45:48,297
[SPEAKER_04]: If you like Dissida, Final Fantasy 1 and 2 remakes are excellent on the PSP.

2415
02:45:48,337 --> 02:45:53,200
[SPEAKER_04]: Going back to really old games, I think Luminous, the old puzzler, and its sequel, I think the sequel's good.

2416
02:45:53,500 --> 02:45:58,223
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the best puzzle games they ever put out on the PSP almost was like a reason to own the system.

2417
02:45:58,803 --> 02:46:02,326
[SPEAKER_04]: I liked Every Extend Extra, which was another Mr. Gucci game.

2418
02:46:02,346 --> 02:46:03,926
[SPEAKER_10]: I liked Papa Lacrosse for a good RPG.

2419
02:46:04,227 --> 02:46:04,427
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm-hmm.

2420
02:46:05,187 --> 02:46:24,553
[SPEAKER_04]: Loco Roco is a cutesy game if you like cutesy games um there's you know PSP has quite a few little highlights in there and a lot of the ports are surprisingly not bad like little big planet on PSP pretty good uh you might like 30 second game heroes since I was talking about the 3d dot game heroes the 30 second or half minute hero or whatever it's called is pretty good too it's fun

2421
02:46:24,721 --> 02:46:25,121
[SPEAKER_02]: Kingdom Hearts PSP

2422
02:46:43,086 --> 02:46:46,210
[SPEAKER_02]: And there should be more stuff coming out, I think, in the fourth quarter, of course.

2423
02:46:46,770 --> 02:46:49,874
[SPEAKER_04]: If you like music games, DJ Max is out there.

2424
02:46:50,154 --> 02:46:53,238
[SPEAKER_04]: And I like Rock Band Unplugged, but not everybody liked that.

2425
02:46:53,278 --> 02:46:56,541
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you like your 2DX type games, DJ Max is a good alternative.

2426
02:46:57,583 --> 02:47:00,025
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's it for music games.

2427
02:47:01,471 --> 02:47:01,731
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2428
02:47:03,252 --> 02:47:06,693
[SPEAKER_04]: Alf in our chatroom is suggesting Hatsune Miku Project Diva.

2429
02:47:08,794 --> 02:47:09,654
[SPEAKER_04]: I forgot about that one.

2430
02:47:09,955 --> 02:47:11,095
[SPEAKER_04]: Good call.

2431
02:47:11,135 --> 02:47:13,116
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the PSP collections are really good too.

2432
02:47:13,136 --> 02:47:14,897
[SPEAKER_04]: The Gradius collection was pretty awesome.

2433
02:47:15,297 --> 02:47:16,757
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some pretty good collections of games.

2434
02:47:16,797 --> 02:47:18,618
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't there a Mega Man collection on PSP as well?

2435
02:47:18,918 --> 02:47:19,418
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty cool.

2436
02:47:19,679 --> 02:47:21,079
[SPEAKER_04]: No, there wasn't a Mega Man collection.

2437
02:47:21,099 --> 02:47:25,601
[SPEAKER_14]: But there's Mega Man... Mega Man X remade to 3D.

2438
02:47:25,921 --> 02:47:26,601
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what it is.

2439
02:47:26,781 --> 02:47:27,042
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

2440
02:47:27,362 --> 02:47:30,183
[SPEAKER_02]: They also have the powered up Mega Man that was like the super deformed Mega Man 1.

2441
02:47:32,037 --> 02:47:32,298
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2442
02:47:33,059 --> 02:47:33,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there you go.

2443
02:47:33,659 --> 02:47:34,400
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that it for emails?

2444
02:47:34,641 --> 02:47:35,983
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought there was a last minute.

2445
02:47:36,003 --> 02:47:37,144
[SPEAKER_04]: You want me to refresh the inbox?

2446
02:47:37,344 --> 02:47:38,406
[SPEAKER_04]: I think one more email.

2447
02:47:38,466 --> 02:47:39,147
[SPEAKER_04]: It was from you.

2448
02:47:39,608 --> 02:47:40,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

2449
02:47:40,469 --> 02:47:41,871
[SPEAKER_08]: You said you were sending it, Rob.

2450
02:47:42,852 --> 02:47:43,834
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm not checking it.

2451
02:47:44,154 --> 02:47:45,055
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not going to read it?

2452
02:47:46,553 --> 02:47:47,354
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you should read it.

2453
02:47:47,454 --> 02:47:48,395
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just so upset.

2454
02:47:48,995 --> 02:47:49,235
[SPEAKER_04]: Fine.

2455
02:47:49,536 --> 02:47:53,219
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like... She's taking away my voice, everybody.

2456
02:47:53,599 --> 02:47:56,502
[SPEAKER_02]: That does not fit with the theme of the show.

2457
02:47:56,582 --> 02:48:01,526
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, this is a show where every gamer has a voice and I am not being heard.

2458
02:48:04,228 --> 02:48:06,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially since you are a super game analyst.

2459
02:48:06,710 --> 02:48:08,312
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I'm a video game analyst.

2460
02:48:13,598 --> 02:48:15,399
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura just read it and she wants to die.

2461
02:48:16,200 --> 02:48:17,281
[SPEAKER_02]: What's it say, DarkSakura?

2462
02:48:17,921 --> 02:48:19,002
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate you all so much.

2463
02:48:20,303 --> 02:48:22,545
[SPEAKER_10]: I want you all to get the hot shotgun bullets to die.

2464
02:48:24,826 --> 02:48:29,490
[SPEAKER_04]: I wrote Dan sucks, LOL, but I spelled sucks, S-U-X, because I know she loves that.

2465
02:48:31,081 --> 02:48:32,442
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds like proper English to me.

2466
02:48:32,502 --> 02:48:33,483
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, sucks.

2467
02:48:33,523 --> 02:48:35,925
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how it turns out on my phone when I text people.

2468
02:48:37,126 --> 02:48:37,426
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

2469
02:48:38,186 --> 02:48:38,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Ow.

2470
02:48:39,407 --> 02:48:39,928
[SPEAKER_04]: You see this?

2471
02:48:40,088 --> 02:48:41,149
[SPEAKER_04]: It's mine now.

2472
02:48:41,289 --> 02:48:43,110
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's landed in my yard.

2473
02:48:43,170 --> 02:48:43,731
[SPEAKER_04]: It's mine now.

2474
02:48:43,791 --> 02:48:45,732
[SPEAKER_04]: This is my... What the hell is it, Alan?

2475
02:48:45,792 --> 02:48:46,272
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2476
02:48:46,413 --> 02:48:48,314
[SPEAKER_04]: You're sleeping on the couch.

2477
02:48:48,934 --> 02:48:49,255
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

2478
02:48:51,256 --> 02:48:52,717
[SPEAKER_04]: This is definitely the time of the show.

2479
02:48:52,737 --> 02:48:53,918
[SPEAKER_10]: I approve of Alan.

2480
02:48:53,958 --> 02:48:54,559
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much.

2481
02:48:54,579 --> 02:48:58,762
[SPEAKER_04]: This is definitely the part of the show where we're going to get angsty with a segment we call the FUs of the Week.

2482
02:49:15,578 --> 02:49:16,799
[SPEAKER_10]: F you to my head hurting.

2483
02:49:18,199 --> 02:49:18,880
[SPEAKER_10]: And Rob.

2484
02:49:21,461 --> 02:49:22,101
[SPEAKER_10]: You stink.

2485
02:49:22,582 --> 02:49:23,162
[SPEAKER_04]: You sucks.

2486
02:49:24,703 --> 02:49:25,043
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

2487
02:49:27,924 --> 02:49:29,445
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess F you to lack of sleep.

2488
02:49:30,946 --> 02:49:32,326
[SPEAKER_02]: The baby doesn't know better.

2489
02:49:32,586 --> 02:49:34,828
[SPEAKER_02]: He just doesn't know what night and day is yet.

2490
02:49:36,048 --> 02:49:38,509
[SPEAKER_02]: He also had trouble pooping.

2491
02:49:39,310 --> 02:49:43,512
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully he is past that now because I hate trying to make him poop.

2492
02:49:44,992 --> 02:49:45,712
[SPEAKER_02]: It's difficult.

2493
02:49:45,732 --> 02:49:50,434
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's not difficult, but it's got to be embarrassing for him, but he doesn't know anything yet.

2494
02:49:50,674 --> 02:49:52,015
[SPEAKER_10]: Tell Nelly to stop eating onions.

2495
02:49:53,796 --> 02:49:55,316
[SPEAKER_02]: That has nothing to do with him not pooping.

2496
02:49:55,756 --> 02:49:57,137
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm really curious.

2497
02:49:57,357 --> 02:49:59,338
[SPEAKER_09]: Eating onions will give babies constipation.

2498
02:49:59,358 --> 02:50:01,099
[SPEAKER_04]: She doesn't breastfeed enough.

2499
02:50:01,819 --> 02:50:03,940
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we going to get poop stories every week on OLR now?

2500
02:50:03,980 --> 02:50:04,600
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be great.

2501
02:50:05,360 --> 02:50:07,181
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, I can tell you poop stories.

2502
02:50:07,501 --> 02:50:09,582
[SPEAKER_02]: See, because he's constipated, so he can't go.

2503
02:50:09,602 --> 02:50:10,563
[SPEAKER_02]: Is he still green?

2504
02:50:10,863 --> 02:50:11,523
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to take...

2505
02:50:11,943 --> 02:50:12,784
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's great.

2506
02:50:12,984 --> 02:50:22,654
[SPEAKER_02]: So he has to have little suppositories put up there, and that doesn't really stay up there, but it triggers him to poop.

2507
02:50:23,054 --> 02:50:25,656
[SPEAKER_02]: But he, this morning, he pooped like three times, so he's fine.

2508
02:50:26,998 --> 02:50:27,678
[SPEAKER_04]: Congratulations.

2509
02:50:28,499 --> 02:50:28,779
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

2510
02:50:29,000 --> 02:50:33,324
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good for him, but he still grunts all night long and does his kung fu, so I don't know.

2511
02:50:33,924 --> 02:50:36,127
[SPEAKER_02]: See, that's quite good for having him watch Ninja Warriors.

2512
02:50:37,916 --> 02:50:39,959
[SPEAKER_04]: Alan, do you have any FUs?

2513
02:50:39,999 --> 02:50:41,200
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully they don't involve poop.

2514
02:50:41,320 --> 02:50:42,622
[SPEAKER_14]: His first word should be Hadouken.

2515
02:50:43,863 --> 02:50:45,425
[SPEAKER_13]: Street fighter.

2516
02:50:45,585 --> 02:50:51,692
[SPEAKER_14]: FU to salmonella, E. coli, and other invisible poop that hides in your food and makes you sick when you go on vacation.

2517
02:50:52,333 --> 02:50:52,813
[SPEAKER_02]: Bad eggs?

2518
02:50:54,455 --> 02:50:55,156
[SPEAKER_14]: Bad chicken, I think.

2519
02:50:57,418 --> 02:50:58,279
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it was a bad egg.

2520
02:50:59,358 --> 02:51:00,019
[SPEAKER_04]: I won $400 playing craps.

2521
02:51:00,059 --> 02:51:00,559
[SPEAKER_04]: How did you do?

2522
02:51:20,270 --> 02:51:20,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Dynafire.

2523
02:51:21,911 --> 02:51:24,914
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm happy for my friends, but I'm sad for me.

2524
02:51:25,635 --> 02:51:26,876
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what's really important, right?

2525
02:51:28,277 --> 02:51:31,080
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a couple more stories for you guys, and then the Skype line.

2526
02:51:31,100 --> 02:51:32,361
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to take your phone calls.

2527
02:51:32,581 --> 02:51:33,302
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, God.

2528
02:51:34,142 --> 02:51:34,963
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, what do you got for us?

2529
02:51:35,323 --> 02:51:36,825
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't sound too excited there.

2530
02:51:38,206 --> 02:51:40,987
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have some news about Super Street Fighter 4.

2531
02:51:41,487 --> 02:51:46,810
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, the arcade version has a few empty slots available for some new characters.

2532
02:51:47,410 --> 02:51:48,711
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what they're going to get.

2533
02:51:48,851 --> 02:51:55,115
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to get some new characters that are going to be, I guess, exclusive to the arcade, at least for right now.

2534
02:51:56,495 --> 02:51:59,537
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, it doesn't say exactly what characters those are going to be.

2535
02:51:59,837 --> 02:52:01,358
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that is yet to be determined.

2536
02:52:01,458 --> 02:52:03,239
[SPEAKER_02]: But there will be some new characters coming.

2537
02:52:05,762 --> 02:52:06,082
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't mind...

2538
02:52:22,458 --> 02:52:22,998
[SPEAKER_14]: Rolento.

2539
02:52:24,258 --> 02:52:25,219
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, what's her name?

2540
02:52:26,039 --> 02:52:26,519
[SPEAKER_14]: Alima?

2541
02:52:26,759 --> 02:52:27,159
[SPEAKER_14]: Alima?

2542
02:52:27,539 --> 02:52:28,359
[SPEAKER_14]: Alina?

2543
02:52:28,439 --> 02:52:28,719
[SPEAKER_04]: Alina.

2544
02:52:28,879 --> 02:52:30,860
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, Alima's your Warcraft character.

2545
02:52:31,280 --> 02:52:35,361
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, from the kick character from Street Fighter 3 was awesome.

2546
02:52:35,521 --> 02:52:35,681
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

2547
02:52:35,941 --> 02:52:36,121
[SPEAKER_14]: Her.

2548
02:52:38,021 --> 02:52:38,761
[SPEAKER_04]: Might get to see it.

2549
02:52:38,801 --> 02:52:39,141
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?

2550
02:52:39,682 --> 02:52:41,642
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, I know you're a Capcom fangirl too.

2551
02:52:41,682 --> 02:52:44,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Any extra characters for Street Fighter 4?

2552
02:52:45,663 --> 02:52:46,403
[SPEAKER_10]: That I want to see?

2553
02:52:46,483 --> 02:52:46,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2554
02:52:48,277 --> 02:52:51,819
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, in the arcade version, I would love to have Sakura if there was another arcade version.

2555
02:52:52,859 --> 02:52:55,320
[SPEAKER_04]: But... Well, she'd be in there because it's all the regular characters.

2556
02:52:55,340 --> 02:52:57,581
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'm saying for an arcade version, I would want Sakura.

2557
02:52:57,822 --> 02:52:58,022
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

2558
02:52:58,442 --> 02:53:01,143
[SPEAKER_10]: And other than that, I'd say Ibuki.

2559
02:53:02,724 --> 02:53:04,285
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I was a big Ibuki player.

2560
02:53:04,665 --> 02:53:05,365
[SPEAKER_09]: Or maybe Karin.

2561
02:53:06,826 --> 02:53:07,206
[SPEAKER_04]: Alrighty.

2562
02:53:09,027 --> 02:53:10,107
[SPEAKER_04]: I got one more story for you guys.

2563
02:53:10,188 --> 02:53:11,488
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I know, I know, I know.

2564
02:53:11,508 --> 02:53:12,008
[SPEAKER_04]: Who would be great?

2565
02:53:12,068 --> 02:53:12,569
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope, too late.

2566
02:53:13,309 --> 02:53:13,989
[SPEAKER_09]: You know who would be great?

2567
02:53:14,129 --> 02:53:14,450
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, who?

2568
02:53:14,710 --> 02:53:15,170
[SPEAKER_09]: Rainbow Mika.

2569
02:53:16,219 --> 02:53:16,419
[SPEAKER_04]: BOMB

2570
02:53:39,989 --> 02:53:42,210
[SPEAKER_04]: How much did it cost to make?

2571
02:53:42,250 --> 02:53:42,671
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that profits?

2572
02:53:42,691 --> 02:53:44,652
[SPEAKER_04]: So then it made less than it cost?

2573
02:54:08,828 --> 02:54:10,410
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe they're saying that, yes.

2574
02:54:11,672 --> 02:54:12,393
[SPEAKER_04]: But here's the thing, too.

2575
02:54:12,693 --> 02:54:13,274
[SPEAKER_04]: I should say this.

2576
02:54:14,055 --> 02:54:15,437
[SPEAKER_04]: Technically, it's not a video game movie.

2577
02:54:15,457 --> 02:54:16,358
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a comic book movie.

2578
02:54:16,919 --> 02:54:20,744
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's still got the whole video game tie-in.

2579
02:54:20,784 --> 02:54:23,668
[SPEAKER_04]: But I mean, this is the really sad part, is that...

2580
02:54:24,429 --> 02:54:29,092
[SPEAKER_04]: The movie Gamer with Gerard Butler made $11.8 million.

2581
02:54:29,192 --> 02:54:30,833
[SPEAKER_04]: It made more money than Scott Pilgrim's first movie.

2582
02:54:30,853 --> 02:54:33,834
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's a generic action movie with Gerard Butler.

2583
02:54:33,914 --> 02:54:37,456
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this movie didn't have a lot of big names in it.

2584
02:54:37,476 --> 02:54:40,158
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Michael Cera, yay?

2585
02:54:40,678 --> 02:54:41,058
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

2586
02:54:41,819 --> 02:54:44,160
[SPEAKER_02]: That and people have really terrible tastes.

2587
02:54:44,240 --> 02:54:48,923
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Vampire Sucks being number two and...

2588
02:54:49,503 --> 02:54:53,850
[SPEAKER_02]: Not to say that The Expendables is a bad movie, but see, that's once again a generic action movie.

2589
02:54:53,890 --> 02:54:56,153
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you like action movies, you go see that.

2590
02:54:56,173 --> 02:54:57,095
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be awesome.

2591
02:54:57,215 --> 02:55:03,685
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas, this is basically, you know, some guy that's falling in love with a woman and he has to fight her exes.

2592
02:55:03,765 --> 02:55:04,226
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's...

2593
02:55:05,134 --> 02:55:07,055
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like, what was it?

2594
02:55:07,075 --> 02:55:10,175
[SPEAKER_02]: That's almost like, was it my super ex-girlfriend or something like that?

2595
02:55:11,036 --> 02:55:12,996
[SPEAKER_02]: Which was also lousy, but yeah.

2596
02:55:13,837 --> 02:55:15,657
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's the kind of vibe that that sends off.

2597
02:55:15,957 --> 02:55:20,699
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, granted, it was an awesome movie, but not a lot of people really get that kind of stuff.

2598
02:55:21,219 --> 02:55:21,999
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they're not us.

2599
02:55:22,239 --> 02:55:27,666
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, for what it's worth, it made more money than The Wizard, which made $4.2 million its opening weekend back in 1989.

2600
02:55:28,286 --> 02:55:30,829
[SPEAKER_04]: And Alone in the Dark did better than a New Evil movie.

2601
02:55:30,969 --> 02:55:32,131
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I hope so.

2602
02:55:32,331 --> 02:55:36,436
[SPEAKER_04]: And Double Dragon with Scott Wolfe only made $2.6 million its opening weekend.

2603
02:55:36,476 --> 02:55:38,558
[SPEAKER_04]: So at least it did better than that.

2604
02:55:38,619 --> 02:55:41,582
[SPEAKER_02]: And Scott Wolfe is not like people reminding him about that movie.

2605
02:55:42,943 --> 02:55:45,824
[SPEAKER_04]: So you really liked Scott Pilgrim, right, Loki?

2606
02:55:46,244 --> 02:55:46,664
[SPEAKER_02]: I loved it.

2607
02:55:46,684 --> 02:55:47,305
[SPEAKER_02]: What did you like about it?

2608
02:55:47,345 --> 02:55:47,925
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd go see it again.

2609
02:55:48,385 --> 02:55:49,545
[SPEAKER_02]: I just like the whole vibe of it.

2610
02:55:50,026 --> 02:55:52,647
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of in-jokes, I guess, if you're a gamer.

2611
02:55:52,687 --> 02:55:54,547
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of things and references that you catch.

2612
02:55:54,867 --> 02:55:56,108
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the characters in it.

2613
02:55:56,688 --> 02:55:59,569
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, one of my favorite characters was Wallace in there because he was just...

2614
02:56:00,209 --> 02:56:03,451
[SPEAKER_02]: Cracking all sorts of comments and stuff throughout the movie.

2615
02:56:04,011 --> 02:56:08,793
[SPEAKER_04]: But see, one of the things that bugged me about the movie is that characters like him, they just kind of disappear.

2616
02:56:09,574 --> 02:56:11,215
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot not resolved, I feel like.

2617
02:56:11,235 --> 02:56:15,397
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like they tried to cram too much with six comic books into one movie.

2618
02:56:15,517 --> 02:56:17,678
[SPEAKER_04]: But I mean, how else are you going to do it?

2619
02:56:17,838 --> 02:56:19,399
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really know how else they would have done it.

2620
02:56:19,419 --> 02:56:21,180
[SPEAKER_09]: They did it with Watchmen, and Watchmen worked.

2621
02:56:21,620 --> 02:56:21,880
[SPEAKER_04]: True.

2622
02:56:22,680 --> 02:56:23,941
[SPEAKER_04]: What did you think of the movie, Alan?

2623
02:56:25,979 --> 02:56:30,042
[SPEAKER_14]: I liked how the video game fandom meta stuff was put in.

2624
02:56:31,223 --> 02:56:33,865
[SPEAKER_14]: As far as the actual story, I didn't care for it.

2625
02:56:33,925 --> 02:56:35,666
[SPEAKER_14]: I thought it was kind of creepy and sexist.

2626
02:56:37,347 --> 02:56:40,890
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I'm all, I don't know, I'm too serious about that kind of stuff.

2627
02:56:40,910 --> 02:56:41,631
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you're a lesbian.

2628
02:56:41,671 --> 02:56:44,693
[SPEAKER_02]: They glossed over some of the characters, like the twins, for example.

2629
02:56:44,733 --> 02:56:46,514
[SPEAKER_02]: They kind of glossed over who they even were.

2630
02:56:46,794 --> 02:56:51,858
[SPEAKER_02]: We just knew they were twins, she dated them at some point, and they had a battle, and that was it.

2631
02:56:52,278 --> 02:56:53,800
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, don't even know why...

2632
02:56:55,280 --> 02:56:59,441
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of think they should have just cut that scene out of the movie and just had her have five exes.

2633
02:56:59,501 --> 02:57:00,321
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?

2634
02:57:01,561 --> 02:57:03,122
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they could develop something else.

2635
02:57:03,242 --> 02:57:04,302
[SPEAKER_04]: It just seemed a little strange.

2636
02:57:04,582 --> 02:57:12,304
[SPEAKER_04]: But part of what I really liked about it, and I think I liked it more than Alan did, although I did have some problems with it, including an unlikable main character.

2637
02:57:13,304 --> 02:57:18,685
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought that it was so random in some parts that I couldn't help but laugh my ass off.

2638
02:57:19,085 --> 02:57:21,266
[SPEAKER_04]: TheVeganPolice What the hell was that?

2639
02:57:21,326 --> 02:57:22,706
[SPEAKER_04]: That was funny.

2640
02:57:22,766 --> 02:57:23,767
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, telekinesis.

2641
02:57:24,027 --> 02:57:24,747
[SPEAKER_04]: It was great.

2642
02:57:25,988 --> 02:57:29,789
[SPEAKER_02]: I just liked all the different random things in there.

2643
02:57:29,889 --> 02:57:38,232
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, at the end where he's complaining, he's like, I can't believe you did that.

2644
02:57:38,833 --> 02:57:40,073
[SPEAKER_02]: It took me two hours!

2645
02:57:40,493 --> 02:57:43,534
[SPEAKER_02]: Two hours to look up all their information and contact numbers.

2646
02:57:45,015 --> 02:57:45,435
[SPEAKER_02]: It was funny.

2647
02:57:46,015 --> 02:57:47,396
[SPEAKER_02]: The League of Evil Exes.

2648
02:57:48,317 --> 02:57:52,421
[SPEAKER_02]: See, I thought for sure that he'd become part of the League of the Evil Exes at the end of the movie.

2649
02:57:52,522 --> 02:57:53,803
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, spoiler!

2650
02:57:56,146 --> 02:57:57,387
[SPEAKER_02]: I said I thought that he would.

2651
02:57:57,407 --> 02:57:59,590
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't say he actually did.

2652
02:57:59,750 --> 02:58:02,473
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anyhow.

2653
02:58:03,074 --> 02:58:04,936
[SPEAKER_04]: It was okay.

2654
02:58:04,976 --> 02:58:05,937
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'd say I liked it.

2655
02:58:06,197 --> 02:58:06,978
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I liked...

2656
02:58:08,547 --> 02:58:14,189
[SPEAKER_04]: The direction and the ambience of the movie and just the whole like, you know, just turning my brain off and enjoying it.

2657
02:58:14,249 --> 02:58:15,210
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a video game.

2658
02:58:15,690 --> 02:58:17,291
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I liked it for that reason.

2659
02:58:17,351 --> 02:58:20,292
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd see it again, just especially because like DarkSakura still hasn't seen it.

2660
02:58:20,312 --> 02:58:21,092
[SPEAKER_04]: She's like, I want to go.

2661
02:58:21,112 --> 02:58:23,653
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously, you need to check out the PlayStation Network game.

2662
02:58:24,173 --> 02:58:25,434
[SPEAKER_02]: It is awesome.

2663
02:58:25,834 --> 02:58:27,635
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet it makes a really good video game.

2664
02:58:27,795 --> 02:58:29,055
[SPEAKER_02]: Ironically, awesome game.

2665
02:58:29,195 --> 02:58:33,037
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's by that guy who remember when we were doing.

2666
02:58:33,277 --> 02:58:37,319
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been playing with the avatar creator on the website though, that's pretty fun

2667
02:58:53,422 --> 02:58:54,183
[SPEAKER_04]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2668
02:59:16,841 --> 02:59:19,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Please call Echo 123 first.

2669
02:59:19,625 --> 02:59:23,369
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think in the newer versions of Skype they actually say make a test call.

2670
02:59:23,429 --> 02:59:24,491
[SPEAKER_04]: Do not skip that step.

2671
02:59:24,551 --> 02:59:30,358
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very important because a lot of our crap calls come in because you didn't test your connection and then we know.

2672
02:59:31,582 --> 02:59:35,263
[SPEAKER_04]: or you can always use the trusty old regular telephone and you don't have to screw around with that too much.

2673
02:59:35,283 --> 02:59:41,565
[SPEAKER_04]: 1-877-GAME-OLR Meanwhile, while we wait for some calls to come in, are there any last minute stories?

2674
02:59:41,825 --> 02:59:46,606
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Just Dance 2 just announced the track list for that.

2675
02:59:47,346 --> 02:59:49,927
[SPEAKER_02]: Some songs that they have in there that you can dance to, I guess.

2676
02:59:49,967 --> 02:59:51,107
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm getting hammered with calls.

2677
02:59:51,147 --> 02:59:51,887
[SPEAKER_04]: We better go to the calls.

2678
02:59:52,167 --> 02:59:52,687
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll come back to that.

2679
02:59:53,268 --> 02:59:54,228
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2680
02:59:54,248 --> 02:59:54,608
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

2681
02:59:56,648 --> 02:59:56,928
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello?

2682
02:59:57,269 --> 02:59:58,489
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2683
02:59:58,509 --> 02:59:58,829
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

2684
03:00:00,365 --> 03:00:01,446
[SPEAKER_11]: It's Kine.

2685
03:00:02,106 --> 03:00:03,087
[SPEAKER_04]: Not too much.

2686
03:00:03,127 --> 03:00:08,510
[SPEAKER_11]: I was calling in about the Poof Poof reference in Dragon Quest IX.

2687
03:00:08,530 --> 03:00:13,853
[SPEAKER_11]: The reference in 3D.GameHeroes is actually from a previous Dragon Quest off of the NES.

2688
03:00:26,541 --> 03:00:35,818
[SPEAKER_11]: I was titled Dragon Warriors here in the States Yeah, and I can't remember which one it was But I think it was the first Dragon Warrior that came out

2689
03:00:37,190 --> 03:00:43,973
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't... I didn't even catch that as being an original Dragon Warrior reference.

2690
03:00:44,353 --> 03:00:57,878
[SPEAKER_04]: I just thought it was funny, because don't they do this whole thing where they put, like, in 3D.GameHeroes, it's been a couple months since I played it, but don't they do this whole, like, little switcheroo thing where it ends up, it's her dad giving the, you know, massage or whatever they play it off as to get you ready?

2691
03:00:58,138 --> 03:00:58,498
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

2692
03:00:58,518 --> 03:00:58,738
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

2693
03:01:00,467 --> 03:01:04,032
[SPEAKER_11]: And if I remember right, that's also the inside joke.

2694
03:01:04,052 --> 03:01:09,699
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a lot of Dragon Quest and Zelda references inside of that game.

2695
03:01:09,739 --> 03:01:15,166
[SPEAKER_11]: In the first round, you can go in the back and there's this line that says, From Dragon Quest 3.

2696
03:01:15,887 --> 03:01:18,029
[SPEAKER_11]: So, that's all in.

2697
03:01:19,289 --> 03:01:20,469
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I appreciate it.

2698
03:01:20,549 --> 03:01:26,190
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, it's kind of funny to know that now that that actually was from another game.

2699
03:01:26,210 --> 03:01:31,371
[SPEAKER_04]: It was kind of another little reference and not just something they made up, but I like that 3D.GameHeroes, man.

2700
03:01:31,411 --> 03:01:44,633
[SPEAKER_04]: If you played, especially if you actually grew up with the 8 and 16-bit games, even if you didn't, if you have an appreciation for them, but especially if you did grow up with them, I think it's just a hilarious video game because it's made by nerds like you and me, clearly.

2701
03:01:45,874 --> 03:01:47,054
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it was

2702
03:01:47,884 --> 03:01:53,131
[SPEAKER_11]: Definitely more two-source people that grew up, you know, in this 8 and 16-bit era.

2703
03:01:54,472 --> 03:01:56,915
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, oh yeah, that was the other thing.

2704
03:01:57,015 --> 03:01:59,579
[SPEAKER_11]: I demand a Commodore 64 episode.

2705
03:02:01,667 --> 03:02:02,167
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god Oh my god

2706
03:02:29,232 --> 03:02:33,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, kind, thank you so much for the call and have fun with 3D.GameHeroes.

2707
03:02:33,635 --> 03:02:34,395
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a great value.

2708
03:02:35,496 --> 03:02:36,416
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, thank you.

2709
03:02:36,536 --> 03:02:38,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, later.

2710
03:02:38,898 --> 03:02:42,740
[SPEAKER_04]: 1-877-GAME-OLR if you'd like to give us a call or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2711
03:02:43,200 --> 03:02:44,141
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to another call.

2712
03:02:44,221 --> 03:02:45,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2713
03:02:45,362 --> 03:02:45,742
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

2714
03:02:47,243 --> 03:02:52,386
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, this is Butcher, either on email or DarkKisuke on Twitter.

2715
03:02:52,946 --> 03:02:55,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Butcher or DarkKisuke on Twitter.

2716
03:02:55,068 --> 03:02:55,528
[SPEAKER_04]: What's on your mind?

2717
03:02:57,040 --> 03:02:58,421
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to make this quick.

2718
03:02:58,461 --> 03:03:02,022
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to thank you guys for giving me PSP game suggestions earlier.

2719
03:03:02,823 --> 03:03:03,943
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, this was your email.

2720
03:03:03,983 --> 03:03:04,543
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, yes.

2721
03:03:05,904 --> 03:03:12,047
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's about it right now, but I had something else and it completely skipped my mind.

2722
03:03:12,634 --> 03:03:12,974
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh-oh.

2723
03:03:13,834 --> 03:03:19,575
[SPEAKER_04]: See, this happens to us a lot when we do live radio is that we're actually doing a show and then we forget what we wanted to talk about.

2724
03:03:19,936 --> 03:03:23,516
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's why we always write things down before we do the show.

2725
03:03:23,576 --> 03:03:25,517
[SPEAKER_04]: But even then, it sometimes doesn't help us.

2726
03:03:25,997 --> 03:03:30,518
[SPEAKER_04]: But okay, so you were asking for the PSP games?

2727
03:03:31,798 --> 03:03:32,418
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that was me.

2728
03:03:32,578 --> 03:03:34,018
[SPEAKER_04]: Did any of those sound interesting to you?

2729
03:03:34,058 --> 03:03:35,699
[SPEAKER_04]: You think you might actually go out and pick any of those up?

2730
03:03:36,999 --> 03:03:41,220
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, once I actually get a job, I'm probably going to go out and hunt down a few Final Fantasy games.

2731
03:03:41,741 --> 03:03:45,203
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, unfortunately, that is the problem a lot of people are having right now in this economy.

2732
03:03:45,263 --> 03:03:49,705
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of ironic because we got that email about the high prices of games too.

2733
03:03:50,386 --> 03:03:55,628
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just, you know, in this economy, it's so hard to kind of afford a lot of that.

2734
03:03:55,949 --> 03:04:00,551
[SPEAKER_04]: And a couple weeks ago here on the show, it was about three weeks ago now, we had that gal, and I'm so sorry, I forgot her name.

2735
03:04:00,571 --> 03:04:03,693
[SPEAKER_04]: What was her, I remember her real name, but she went by something else here on the show.

2736
03:04:04,233 --> 03:04:06,354
[SPEAKER_04]: The gal who sat here the night Loki had the baby.

2737
03:04:07,274 --> 03:04:08,255
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, Ashley.

2738
03:04:09,015 --> 03:04:09,135
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

2739
03:04:09,296 --> 03:04:10,036
[SPEAKER_10]: I forgot what her...

2740
03:04:11,764 --> 03:04:13,805
[SPEAKER_10]: I forgot what her online name was, but Ashley.

2741
03:04:36,718 --> 03:04:42,362
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well anyway, good luck with the PSP and let us know if you do find some good games to pass along to the listeners.

2742
03:04:42,402 --> 03:04:43,102
[SPEAKER_04]: Let us know, alright?

2743
03:04:44,483 --> 03:04:45,064
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, sure thing.

2744
03:04:45,244 --> 03:04:46,285
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, take care, buddy.

2745
03:04:46,705 --> 03:04:48,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, go ahead.

2746
03:04:48,206 --> 03:04:51,688
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to talk about FU to you for getting my name wrong earlier on Twitter.

2747
03:04:51,728 --> 03:04:55,151
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not DarkKisuke.

2748
03:04:55,851 --> 03:04:56,171
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2749
03:04:57,512 --> 03:04:58,913
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, that's it.

2750
03:04:59,013 --> 03:05:00,014
[SPEAKER_04]: I do my best.

2751
03:05:00,294 --> 03:05:01,095
[SPEAKER_04]: At least I read it.

2752
03:05:01,235 --> 03:05:01,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

2753
03:05:02,516 --> 03:05:03,556
[SPEAKER_04]: Take care, bye.

2754
03:05:04,797 --> 03:05:05,838
[SPEAKER_04]: I try my best.

2755
03:05:07,972 --> 03:05:09,613
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not spelled out phonetically.

2756
03:05:09,653 --> 03:05:10,673
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm probably not going to get it.

2757
03:05:10,713 --> 03:05:12,413
[SPEAKER_04]: We're getting a lot of calls tonight, but this is awesome.

2758
03:05:12,453 --> 03:05:13,534
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2759
03:05:13,554 --> 03:05:13,934
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

2760
03:05:16,995 --> 03:05:17,315
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.

2761
03:05:17,535 --> 03:05:18,395
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's Xenocore.

2762
03:05:18,475 --> 03:05:19,616
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, how you doing?

2763
03:05:19,756 --> 03:05:20,436
[SPEAKER_04]: A little delay there.

2764
03:05:20,456 --> 03:05:20,896
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all right.

2765
03:05:20,916 --> 03:05:21,676
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, no problem, man.

2766
03:05:21,816 --> 03:05:22,537
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been a long time.

2767
03:05:22,777 --> 03:05:23,537
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it has.

2768
03:05:23,617 --> 03:05:24,577
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you doing, Xenocore?

2769
03:05:25,878 --> 03:05:33,900
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I've moved five states, managed to secure a job after three attempts and many layoffs, and now I'm working for Dell.

2770
03:05:34,440 --> 03:05:35,301
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, congratulations.

2771
03:05:35,361 --> 03:05:36,341
[SPEAKER_06]: Doing army support.

2772
03:05:38,673 --> 03:05:40,074
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, you moved from where to where?

2773
03:05:40,135 --> 03:05:41,496
[SPEAKER_04]: You were in, what, Virginia before?

2774
03:05:43,137 --> 03:05:45,419
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I was in Sebastian, Florida.

2775
03:05:45,719 --> 03:05:47,281
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I'm in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

2776
03:05:47,601 --> 03:05:51,644
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wow, okay, that's quite a move, going from the east to the midwest.

2777
03:05:51,705 --> 03:05:54,067
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, alright, well, how are you liking Oklahoma?

2778
03:05:54,567 --> 03:05:56,208
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been there once, I was 17 years old.

2779
03:05:58,977 --> 03:06:02,298
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty much like living on a space colony as close as you can imagine.

2780
03:06:02,498 --> 03:06:08,220
[SPEAKER_06]: There's little things to do here and there of everything, but you try to go outside the perimeter and there's nothing but wasteland.

2781
03:06:08,560 --> 03:06:10,580
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's kind of isolated.

2782
03:06:10,800 --> 03:06:12,681
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty much where it's at.

2783
03:06:13,181 --> 03:06:14,241
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, what's on your mind tonight?

2784
03:06:15,962 --> 03:06:16,862
[SPEAKER_06]: Not much, not much.

2785
03:06:17,202 --> 03:06:24,004
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm actually getting ready to restart my show, and I've been writing for the Electric Sisterhood magazine in the meantime.

2786
03:06:24,745 --> 03:06:28,710
[SPEAKER_04]: I have heard they launched a magazine and it's not an e-zine, right?

2787
03:06:28,751 --> 03:06:31,274
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an actual, tangible paper magazine, right?

2788
03:06:32,796 --> 03:06:33,817
[SPEAKER_06]: You can get it in either form.

2789
03:06:33,837 --> 03:06:35,577
[SPEAKER_06]: They got it in PDF as well as print.

2790
03:06:35,878 --> 03:06:37,198
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, that's good for them.

2791
03:06:37,238 --> 03:06:39,119
[SPEAKER_04]: That can't be an easy venture for them.

2792
03:06:39,839 --> 03:06:44,042
[SPEAKER_04]: And I always seem to run into Ninja Sister at trade shows, and I think she's adorable.

2793
03:06:44,082 --> 03:06:44,702
[SPEAKER_04]: I really like her.

2794
03:06:44,782 --> 03:06:47,383
[SPEAKER_04]: She's been on some of the OLR special shows, so she's great.

2795
03:06:48,764 --> 03:06:51,965
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we're pimping everything out on landofesh.com now.

2796
03:06:52,366 --> 03:06:52,926
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, very nice.

2797
03:06:52,986 --> 03:06:54,447
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I didn't know there was a whole new website.

2798
03:06:54,467 --> 03:06:55,247
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll go check that out.

2799
03:06:55,327 --> 03:06:55,647
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

2800
03:06:55,667 --> 03:06:56,848
[SPEAKER_04]: What kind of articles are you writing over there?

2801
03:06:58,566 --> 03:07:23,799
[SPEAKER_06]: well the last one I did was a review on how the marketing departments of all these games seem to love to play with the words and tell us what game is and it's actually not that like how I got pissed off with Demon's Souls I wrote all about it in there very interesting because we were just talking earlier about and I apologize this might not have been what you wanted to call in about but we were talking a minute ago about how like it seems like a lot of marketing departments don't actually play video games at all

2802
03:07:25,526 --> 03:07:25,887
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

2803
03:07:34,488 --> 03:07:36,550
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2804
03:07:59,226 --> 03:08:00,046
[SPEAKER_06]: Not much, not much.

2805
03:08:00,367 --> 03:08:05,729
[SPEAKER_06]: I did see Scott Pilgrim, but actually I just recently saw it today and I was quite happy.

2806
03:08:05,749 --> 03:08:07,929
[SPEAKER_06]: I started Facebooking all over the place for it.

2807
03:08:08,390 --> 03:08:18,834
[SPEAKER_06]: But the one thing that surprised me that I haven't seen before was the voice of reason and the guiding light in the entire show was Scott's roommate.

2808
03:08:20,254 --> 03:08:30,460
[SPEAKER_06]: and this is the best possible example I've seen of just a normal person who just happens to like guys too that's treated with a little bit more respect than I've seen in other mediums.

2809
03:08:30,540 --> 03:08:32,281
[SPEAKER_06]: I think things are getting better lately.

2810
03:08:32,701 --> 03:08:34,923
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of agree with that.

2811
03:08:35,083 --> 03:08:40,466
[SPEAKER_04]: It was pretty cool the way that it was just like the cool gay friend and that's just the way it was.

2812
03:08:40,506 --> 03:08:41,627
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think it also shows like...

2813
03:08:42,347 --> 03:08:53,776
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of go back to the original comics, and from what I've read on the original comics is that that character was inspired by a real-life interaction that the author of the comics had with a former roommate of his.

2814
03:08:54,196 --> 03:09:05,705
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it just kind of goes to show that the younger generation, especially, you know, like, and when I say that, God, I make myself sound so old, but just, you know, even folks that are like 10, 15 years younger than us, like, it's just not even an issue anymore.

2815
03:09:06,045 --> 03:09:09,788
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you look at the people who do have an issue with, you know...

2816
03:09:10,528 --> 03:09:12,130
[SPEAKER_04]: same-sex relations and what have you.

2817
03:09:12,190 --> 03:09:14,751
[SPEAKER_04]: It's almost always old fuddy-duddies.

2818
03:09:17,293 --> 03:09:24,899
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why they're so threatened, but it's just comforting to know that especially a lot of the folks that listen to this show, it's just whatever.

2819
03:09:25,059 --> 03:09:26,640
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just not even a big deal.

2820
03:09:27,181 --> 03:09:29,583
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's great because that's the way it should be.

2821
03:09:29,623 --> 03:09:31,864
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just people like who they like.

2822
03:09:32,385 --> 03:09:35,527
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even think you should have to be gay or straight.

2823
03:09:35,827 --> 03:09:37,629
[SPEAKER_04]: Just be nice.

2824
03:09:39,509 --> 03:09:56,929
[SPEAKER_06]: all we need and I have one gaming accomplishment I gotta share before I go I managed to find a working version of Escape from the Planet of Robot Monsters and I got to the last dude and lost all the rest of my credits there it was epic, I loved it

2825
03:09:59,312 --> 03:09:59,812
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

2826
03:10:19,180 --> 03:10:21,683
[SPEAKER_06]: Like whether on PSN or Xbox Live or whatever.

2827
03:10:21,723 --> 03:10:23,825
[SPEAKER_06]: At least the newer ones from like the late 90s and such.

2828
03:10:26,167 --> 03:10:26,748
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all I got.

2829
03:10:26,868 --> 03:10:27,589
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep gaming alive.

2830
03:10:27,829 --> 03:10:28,630
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent job, guys.

2831
03:10:28,750 --> 03:10:29,891
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll talk to you in the future.

2832
03:10:30,231 --> 03:10:31,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much for the phone call.

2833
03:10:31,713 --> 03:10:32,534
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate it, buddy.

2834
03:10:32,574 --> 03:10:33,054
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a good one.

2835
03:10:33,575 --> 03:10:33,975
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, guys.

2836
03:10:34,155 --> 03:10:34,476
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2837
03:10:35,036 --> 03:10:35,296
[SPEAKER_04]: Later.

2838
03:10:35,517 --> 03:10:35,777
[SPEAKER_06]: You too.

2839
03:10:35,897 --> 03:10:36,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye-bye.

2840
03:10:36,337 --> 03:10:37,839
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.

2841
03:10:37,879 --> 03:10:39,521
[SPEAKER_04]: We can take some more calls.

2842
03:10:39,541 --> 03:10:42,824
[SPEAKER_04]: 877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2843
03:10:45,289 --> 03:10:47,771
[SPEAKER_04]: and we'll take some more calls.

2844
03:10:47,931 --> 03:10:49,793
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like things finally slowed up here for a minute.

2845
03:10:50,033 --> 03:10:51,994
[SPEAKER_04]: We can get back to the Just Dance 2 story if you want.

2846
03:10:52,154 --> 03:10:52,334
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

2847
03:10:53,295 --> 03:11:05,284
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the songs in there, including some of the really annoying songs, they've got, let's see here, Kesha with Tick Tock, Outkast with Hey Ya.

2848
03:11:05,364 --> 03:11:07,946
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just thinking there's not enough gutter trash on the Wii.

2849
03:11:08,446 --> 03:11:09,127
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

2850
03:11:10,408 --> 03:11:12,229
[SPEAKER_02]: The Pussycat Dolls, When I Grow Up,

2851
03:11:15,918 --> 03:11:17,960
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't recognize a lot of these songs.

2852
03:11:19,521 --> 03:11:20,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Avril Lavigne, Girlfriend.

2853
03:11:21,082 --> 03:11:24,644
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see here.

2854
03:11:26,405 --> 03:11:27,666
[SPEAKER_02]: Bonnie M, Rasputin.

2855
03:11:29,647 --> 03:11:31,408
[SPEAKER_02]: Cher, the Shoop Shoop song.

2856
03:11:32,849 --> 03:11:34,590
[SPEAKER_02]: Donna Summer's Hot Stuff.

2857
03:11:37,165 --> 03:11:41,268
[SPEAKER_04]: This game sounds more and more like a 70s disco with each song that you read.

2858
03:11:41,348 --> 03:11:43,710
[SPEAKER_02]: Ike and Tina Turner, Proud Mary.

2859
03:11:44,010 --> 03:11:44,410
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

2860
03:11:44,550 --> 03:11:46,812
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, look, we're going to go to a phone call to save this.

2861
03:11:46,852 --> 03:11:49,694
[SPEAKER_02]: It does have Justice with D-A-N-C-E, and that song is awesome.

2862
03:11:49,714 --> 03:11:50,554
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that song is awesome.

2863
03:11:50,574 --> 03:11:51,595
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2864
03:11:51,615 --> 03:11:51,975
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

2865
03:11:53,256 --> 03:11:54,177
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, it's Ranma.

2866
03:11:54,197 --> 03:11:55,338
[SPEAKER_04]: How's everyone doing tonight?

2867
03:11:55,558 --> 03:11:56,138
[SPEAKER_04]: I am great.

2868
03:11:56,198 --> 03:11:56,659
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you?

2869
03:11:58,180 --> 03:11:59,140
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm good.

2870
03:11:59,160 --> 03:12:02,122
[SPEAKER_07]: Before we continue, Loki, congratulations.

2871
03:12:02,643 --> 03:12:02,943
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

2872
03:12:07,563 --> 03:12:10,306
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw Scott Pilgrim vs. the World on Saturday.

2873
03:12:13,268 --> 03:12:14,749
[SPEAKER_07]: I enjoyed the movie, but...

2874
03:12:15,970 --> 03:12:32,055
[SPEAKER_07]: The only issue that I had, maybe because it's my ginormous ego and my portrayal and my odd views of the world, I just didn't like how Scott Pilgrim was portrayed as this socially inept, awkward geek.

2875
03:12:32,515 --> 03:12:36,096
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe it's because of the people that I've run with throughout the years.

2876
03:12:36,676 --> 03:12:39,777
[SPEAKER_07]: I've never come across anybody as bad as him.

2877
03:12:41,717 --> 03:12:42,418
[SPEAKER_04]: I can see that.

2878
03:12:42,438 --> 03:12:43,518
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2879
03:12:45,554 --> 03:12:49,819
[SPEAKER_04]: To me... Isn't that kind of just what Michael Cera is in every movie he's in?

2880
03:12:49,839 --> 03:12:54,304
[SPEAKER_07]: Michael Cera needs to be shot.

2881
03:12:54,604 --> 03:12:56,886
[SPEAKER_07]: Jesse Heinsberg should have been in that movie.

2882
03:12:57,066 --> 03:12:59,629
[SPEAKER_07]: He was the kid from Zombie World.

2883
03:12:59,909 --> 03:13:00,870
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, Zombieland, I'm sorry.

2884
03:13:00,991 --> 03:13:01,271
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm-hmm.

2885
03:13:03,041 --> 03:13:11,363
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I know, but... You know, what's funny is people think that Michael Sher was in Zombieland because they keep mistaking both guys together.

2886
03:13:11,383 --> 03:13:12,563
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, no, that's two separate people.

2887
03:13:15,684 --> 03:13:22,286
[SPEAKER_04]: But did you like him otherwise besides the whole main character, which is funny enough was one of the big problems I had with the movie.

2888
03:13:22,786 --> 03:13:24,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you kind of like everything else about it?

2889
03:13:25,450 --> 03:13:26,091
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I did.

2890
03:13:26,151 --> 03:13:30,715
[SPEAKER_07]: I even had to convince my best friend to watch the movie.

2891
03:13:30,755 --> 03:13:33,517
[SPEAKER_07]: So maybe her view will be a little bit different if she watches it.

2892
03:13:36,480 --> 03:13:46,008
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's kind of a bummer that it's doing so terribly at the box office because I feel like people will never try to do another movie like it.

2893
03:13:47,369 --> 03:13:48,991
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do you think the movie's bombing so terribly?

2894
03:13:50,382 --> 03:13:53,905
[SPEAKER_07]: Simply put, it went up against The Expendables and Julia Roberts.

2895
03:13:54,125 --> 03:13:56,607
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the only reason why it tanked out.

2896
03:13:57,008 --> 03:14:01,471
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, if it was out during an off-season, it would have done good.

2897
03:14:01,931 --> 03:14:05,935
[SPEAKER_07]: Because personally, when I saw the poster, I'm like, hmm, maybe.

2898
03:14:05,995 --> 03:14:06,956
[SPEAKER_07]: And I keep hearing about it.

2899
03:14:06,976 --> 03:14:08,717
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, okay, I'll go see this.

2900
03:14:08,977 --> 03:14:10,919
[SPEAKER_07]: Then The Expendables happens to show up.

2901
03:14:10,979 --> 03:14:13,441
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, this is my 80s childhood right here.

2902
03:14:14,121 --> 03:14:15,623
[SPEAKER_07]: 80s childhood versus...

2903
03:14:16,663 --> 03:14:44,752
[SPEAKER_04]: geekdom geek fandom versus 80s childhood yeah exactly and I'm asking people give me faith in the movie don't give me reasons to see it just give me faith in it unfortunately there was no faith for me with the Expendables it's like wow everything I don't like about 80s movies in one movie I'm like there's the perfect movie for me to not see hmm at least that's how I felt about it but you know

2904
03:14:48,450 --> 03:14:53,013
[SPEAKER_07]: I picked up another DJ Hero turntable controller for $20 and I'm looking forward to DJ Hero 2.

2905
03:15:07,409 --> 03:15:17,463
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, now's a good time to get a turntable controller if you have any interest in DJ Hero 2 because you could probably get the turntable by itself and then DJ Hero 2 by itself for much cheaper than the combo.

2906
03:15:18,705 --> 03:15:23,091
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe because I think it was only on sale with Best Buy and Kmart.

2907
03:15:24,022 --> 03:15:46,777
[SPEAKER_07]: for like two weeks only and now I've been checking prices like it's back at the regular price and my turntable control was on back order for about a week and a half Tekken 6 is on sale for 10 bucks at Best Buy much better than 60 if you have the $20 coupon card which you can print out alright Ranma we're going to let you go so we can try and get at least one more call in here before we sign off for the night but thanks so much for your call okay buddy

2908
03:15:48,069 --> 03:15:48,589
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a problem.

2909
03:15:48,609 --> 03:15:49,490
[SPEAKER_04]: Luigi, out of here.

2910
03:15:49,730 --> 03:15:50,390
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, bye.

2911
03:15:50,450 --> 03:15:50,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Take care.

2912
03:15:52,751 --> 03:15:53,071
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

2913
03:15:53,792 --> 03:15:55,573
[SPEAKER_04]: One more call here I'm going to try to get to tonight.

2914
03:15:55,593 --> 03:15:56,553
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2915
03:15:56,573 --> 03:15:56,933
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

2916
03:15:58,454 --> 03:16:00,055
[SPEAKER_00]: This is DJ Blaziken.

2917
03:16:00,175 --> 03:16:01,496
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Blaziken.

2918
03:16:01,536 --> 03:16:02,216
[SPEAKER_04]: What is on your mind?

2919
03:16:04,297 --> 03:16:09,339
[SPEAKER_00]: Not much other than some possible new games for Butcher to pick up when he gets some cash.

2920
03:16:11,220 --> 03:16:12,661
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, these games went down to like $10.

2921
03:16:12,721 --> 03:16:12,941
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

2922
03:16:15,246 --> 03:16:18,128
[SPEAKER_00]: and they are Twisted Metal.

2923
03:16:20,170 --> 03:16:30,677
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they even dropped... I think it's Buzz Quiz World for $7.99 on PSN.

2924
03:16:31,337 --> 03:16:35,360
[SPEAKER_00]: And then... Oh yeah, Beats.

2925
03:16:36,441 --> 03:16:39,603
[SPEAKER_00]: Which I also have a review for.

2926
03:16:40,664 --> 03:16:42,165
[SPEAKER_00]: Which, it's kind of like...

2927
03:16:43,243 --> 03:16:52,151
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were to take Beatmania and just have three lines, that's what beats is.

2928
03:16:52,211 --> 03:17:00,139
[SPEAKER_00]: But the cool thing is, it's kind of like Stepmania or ITG, where you could use your own music and it goes off your memory card.

2929
03:17:01,677 --> 03:17:03,599
[SPEAKER_00]: Your whole music library that you've done there.

2930
03:17:27,817 --> 03:17:37,766
[SPEAKER_04]: I think is actually a lot better, and it makes its own patterns too based on the MP3s you're playing, but you're not hitting buttons at random like flailing on your keyboard in time to the music.

2931
03:17:38,206 --> 03:17:39,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Audio Surf, the game's kind of different.

2932
03:17:39,808 --> 03:17:42,831
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a puzzle game mixed with music, mixed with action.

2933
03:17:43,351 --> 03:17:44,932
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, it's different, so it works for me.

2934
03:17:45,293 --> 03:17:48,736
[SPEAKER_04]: But, I mean, is this other game you're talking about button flailing or what?

2935
03:17:50,757 --> 03:17:58,624
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, actually, but this one, though, it uses all four of the external circle square buttons on your PSP.

2936
03:17:59,545 --> 03:18:02,067
[SPEAKER_00]: But the cool thing is, well, here's the only jip with it.

2937
03:18:02,627 --> 03:18:06,250
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to play along with some of my DDR soundtrack songs.

2938
03:18:06,871 --> 03:18:07,691
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't work with them.

2939
03:18:08,032 --> 03:18:12,916
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't work with anything under two or three minutes.

2940
03:18:14,077 --> 03:18:14,838
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's weird.

2941
03:18:15,660 --> 03:18:23,322
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate to say it, but for all you B-Money fans who wanted to use your B-Money soundtracks for beats, you're out of luck.

2942
03:18:23,622 --> 03:18:26,763
[SPEAKER_04]: That is kind of weird that it won't work for such short songs.

2943
03:18:26,823 --> 03:18:32,485
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder if that has to do with some type of scoring algorithm or... I can't even think of achievements.

2944
03:18:32,685 --> 03:18:40,347
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a scoring system, but yet it'll work with stuff like the initial B soundtrack, which I have.

2945
03:18:41,348 --> 03:18:45,469
[SPEAKER_00]: The only B-Money song I have on there from that

2946
03:18:46,423 --> 03:19:15,525
[SPEAKER_04]: which I think everyone knows Night of Fire of course you know a lot of the old DDR songs and I mean old old old DDR songs came from a series in Japan called Dance Mania X not to be confused with Dance Maniacs or just the Dance Mania albums and if you can go to those albums you can find a lot of longer versions of old school Bomani songs because they were all trimmed down from CD cuts that were three or four minutes long

2947
03:19:17,560 --> 03:19:19,681
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, I had no clue of that.

2948
03:19:20,041 --> 03:19:21,622
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go, you learn something new every day.

2949
03:19:21,802 --> 03:19:22,042
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

2950
03:19:23,223 --> 03:19:24,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Dance Mania.

2951
03:19:24,683 --> 03:19:25,404
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have one.

2952
03:19:25,804 --> 03:19:26,084
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead.

2953
03:19:26,544 --> 03:19:44,353
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, basically, I was just wondering, what the heck else, you know, oh yeah, even though it's import only, but I say it's worth it if you love racing games, love stuff like Ridge Racer, but might be starting to get tired of it, but also loves anime.

2954
03:19:44,373 --> 03:19:44,613
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

2955
03:19:47,063 --> 03:20:13,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Initial D, Street Stage or PSP which I don't know where else to get that because nowhere sells it here in America well if it's not something you can get on the Playstation store you have to kind of go the harder routes of trying to find, fish up a copy on Ebay or Amazon or one of those but the internet really

2956
03:20:15,976 --> 03:20:19,257
[SPEAKER_04]: So... Alright, well, anything else on your mind, buddy, before we let you go?

2957
03:20:19,277 --> 03:20:33,904
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, um, I got a little question for you on this actor of... Like, I saw something, it was back on the old All Games, and it said a little thing on your profile, like you had some previous college and high school broadcasting experience.

2958
03:20:33,984 --> 03:20:34,164
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

2959
03:20:34,864 --> 03:20:36,165
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got asked this, too.

2960
03:20:36,665 --> 03:20:39,406
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, what got you interested in broadcasting?

2961
03:20:40,127 --> 03:20:41,687
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a really good question.

2962
03:20:41,987 --> 03:20:42,088
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

2963
03:20:44,212 --> 03:20:46,093
[SPEAKER_10]: That's because Rob is a big attention whore.

2964
03:20:46,513 --> 03:20:47,174
[SPEAKER_04]: Not kidding.

2965
03:20:47,194 --> 03:20:48,414
[SPEAKER_04]: Partially.

2966
03:20:48,454 --> 03:20:49,195
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously?

2967
03:20:49,275 --> 03:20:49,955
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the thing.

2968
03:20:50,175 --> 03:20:51,796
[SPEAKER_09]: When I was in college... You know you're giving a hard time.

2969
03:20:51,816 --> 03:20:52,176
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I know.

2970
03:20:52,216 --> 03:20:53,637
[SPEAKER_04]: But no, part of it is I'm an attention whore.

2971
03:20:53,677 --> 03:20:53,937
[SPEAKER_04]: I do.

2972
03:20:54,077 --> 03:21:04,482
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the getting the... Like, for instance, last night at the Rocky thing that I was doing, I got to lead, you know, 4,000, some odd, give or take a few thousand, in doing the time warp.

2973
03:21:04,502 --> 03:21:05,663
[SPEAKER_04]: And that felt awesome.

2974
03:21:05,723 --> 03:21:10,045
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, just, you know, like all the people doing, you know, what I'm telling them to do is just kind of cool.

2975
03:21:10,085 --> 03:21:11,506
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, it was cool.

2976
03:21:12,466 --> 03:21:23,632
[SPEAKER_04]: But to be honest, where that all comes from, I got into radio in college because I actually originally was studying to do computer science because I'm a nerd, I thought I'd like computers, but for me, it wasn't for me.

2977
03:21:23,832 --> 03:21:24,412
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't like it.

2978
03:21:24,612 --> 03:21:25,973
[SPEAKER_04]: It's for other people, but not for me.

2979
03:21:26,053 --> 03:21:29,315
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually had a really bad professor that I think kind of just turned me off to the whole thing.

2980
03:21:30,255 --> 03:21:32,857
[SPEAKER_04]: But I switched to studying television.

2981
03:21:32,897 --> 03:21:41,203
[SPEAKER_04]: I was actually wanting to be – for a little bit, I wanted to be a weatherman, and then I was going to be a broadcast journalist, and I actually interned for a little while at a CBS station up where I went to school.

2982
03:21:42,183 --> 03:21:48,748
[SPEAKER_04]: But I found that the television industry, from my perspective, from doing all that – again, for me, obviously there's people that are into it, but for me –

2983
03:21:49,068 --> 03:21:50,488
[SPEAKER_04]: Too competitive and too cutthroat.

2984
03:21:50,909 --> 03:21:53,049
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, kind of the same thing with radio to some extent.

2985
03:21:53,069 --> 03:21:56,310
[SPEAKER_04]: But when I was doing college radio, I kind of got to do things on my own terms.

2986
03:21:56,570 --> 03:21:58,371
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, it didn't matter if no one was listening.

2987
03:21:58,571 --> 03:22:02,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if one person was listening, it was hilarious and got to have fun doing it.

2988
03:22:02,312 --> 03:22:06,073
[SPEAKER_04]: So when internet radio came about, it seemed like a real natural progression.

2989
03:22:06,213 --> 03:22:17,717
[SPEAKER_04]: Although, to be fair, I think without Travis having kind of helped me make that transition, he's the host of Under Station Alive, I don't know if I would have gotten into internet radio as quickly as I did.

2990
03:22:18,357 --> 03:22:44,954
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I would have gotten here eventually but I don't think I would have gotten into it as quickly as I did outside of school but if I actually wanted to go way way back and I don't think I've talked about this a lot on the show but way back in high school a friend of mine used to have a public access show we actually did on the local television station so I actually had a TV show for about two years my good friend in high school and I actually produced this show that we did it had nothing to do with video games it was more like a little comedy show that we did just because we could but

2991
03:22:45,494 --> 03:22:46,214
[SPEAKER_04]: It was great.

2992
03:22:46,234 --> 03:22:46,854
[SPEAKER_04]: It was great.

2993
03:23:04,339 --> 03:23:07,201
[SPEAKER_04]: and my mother has them somewhere, although I don't know where they are.

2994
03:23:07,221 --> 03:23:08,702
[SPEAKER_04]: And the tape's probably melted by now.

2995
03:23:09,303 --> 03:23:09,723
[SPEAKER_04]: YouTube.

2996
03:23:10,364 --> 03:23:11,184
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope, nope.

2997
03:23:11,485 --> 03:23:20,911
[SPEAKER_04]: I will not let them out because I do not want them on YouTube because unfortunately now that I do have this show, I think if people were to see that, I just... It's... No.

2998
03:23:21,212 --> 03:23:26,716
[SPEAKER_02]: And granted, it would be a pain in the ass to rip that from videotape right now.

2999
03:23:26,836 --> 03:23:31,319
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but unfortunately if it fell in the wrong hands, it would be done sooner than I would like it to happen.

3000
03:23:31,479 --> 03:23:31,799
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not...

3001
03:23:32,600 --> 03:23:33,982
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

3002
03:23:48,678 --> 03:24:08,350
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a substitute teacher one day in a physics class and he came in and he was actually trying to do his little like promotional thing like you know because the public access station was kind of hurting for more volunteers and so forth and he was actually showing us a video that he did like a music video and my friend and I looked at each other and thought this is so like

3003
03:24:09,330 --> 03:24:11,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, that is correct.

3004
03:24:35,205 --> 03:24:36,946
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are kind of my inspiration.

3005
03:24:37,066 --> 03:24:38,786
[SPEAKER_00]: I've listened to you guys since... That's amazing.

3006
03:24:38,806 --> 03:24:39,367
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank God.

3007
03:24:39,427 --> 03:24:39,927
[SPEAKER_00]: What was it?

3008
03:24:40,027 --> 03:24:40,387
[SPEAKER_00]: Episode 50.

3009
03:24:40,587 --> 03:24:48,890
[SPEAKER_00]: Back on the old Live 365 station, which I did mention in a Beatmania review for KIOS91.5.

3010
03:24:49,030 --> 03:24:49,370
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

3011
03:24:49,730 --> 03:24:50,331
[SPEAKER_00]: In Omaha.

3012
03:24:50,511 --> 03:24:50,911
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

3013
03:24:51,531 --> 03:24:55,132
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually mentioned your guys' old Bimani Moore show.

3014
03:24:55,712 --> 03:24:55,873
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.

3015
03:24:56,393 --> 03:24:59,774
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, of course, I was reviewing Beatmania, so I figured, you know what, if you like...

3016
03:25:00,302 --> 03:25:10,747
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the stuff that you hear at the clubs during the rave period or the stuff that you might have heard way back when on Orange Lounge Radio B-Money Moore Show you'll love this game woohoo!

3017
03:25:11,027 --> 03:25:29,535
[SPEAKER_00]: well thank you for the plug I appreciate it that is awesome yeah, and so but I just hope I'm on K-I-O-S dot org live stream and 91.5 K-I-O-S for Omaha listeners if there are any besides me um Jackson Studio One is the show that I'm gonna be on um

3018
03:25:30,000 --> 03:25:32,022
[SPEAKER_00]: and then a few other broadcasting students.

3019
03:25:32,923 --> 03:25:35,505
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting the first show October 7th.

3020
03:25:36,006 --> 03:25:37,147
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, best of luck to you.

3021
03:25:37,187 --> 03:25:38,468
[SPEAKER_04]: That is awesome.

3022
03:25:38,869 --> 03:25:50,020
[SPEAKER_04]: But I laugh because when people tell me that, I think back to the video I saw in high school and I go, I hope people aren't saying I was inspired by Orange Lounge Radio because they thought this show was so terrible and ghetto.

3023
03:25:52,372 --> 03:25:52,933
[SPEAKER_02]: I can see that.

3024
03:25:53,173 --> 03:25:55,676
[SPEAKER_04]: But even if that's the reason, then more power to you.

3025
03:25:56,256 --> 03:25:56,997
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even care.

3026
03:25:57,057 --> 03:25:57,618
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's great.

3027
03:25:57,678 --> 03:26:08,730
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I had somebody tell me to my face that they got into public access because they thought my old TV show, they said, it was so terrible and so awful that you guys really inspired me to do this.

3028
03:26:08,790 --> 03:26:09,931
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, oh, thank you.

3029
03:26:13,816 --> 03:26:15,016
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, buddy, we've got to let you go.

3030
03:26:15,597 --> 03:26:16,237
[SPEAKER_04]: The call's going on.

3031
03:26:16,457 --> 03:26:17,938
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, peace out.

3032
03:26:17,958 --> 03:26:18,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Your show rocks.

3033
03:26:18,899 --> 03:26:19,219
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

3034
03:26:19,259 --> 03:26:19,699
[SPEAKER_04]: You rock.

3035
03:26:19,739 --> 03:26:20,260
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a good one.

3036
03:26:20,380 --> 03:26:20,560
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.

3037
03:26:21,020 --> 03:26:21,260
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.

3038
03:26:21,741 --> 03:26:22,301
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.

3039
03:26:23,282 --> 03:26:24,723
[SPEAKER_04]: That is really the ultimate compliment.

3040
03:26:24,763 --> 03:26:25,203
[SPEAKER_04]: It really is.

3041
03:26:25,283 --> 03:26:26,744
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think we'll end on that note.

3042
03:26:26,784 --> 03:26:28,105
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you guys very much for the calls.

3043
03:26:28,465 --> 03:26:30,066
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so sorry to those who didn't get through.

3044
03:26:30,106 --> 03:26:31,287
[SPEAKER_04]: But hey, we'll be back next week.

3045
03:26:31,327 --> 03:26:33,168
[SPEAKER_04]: So please send us emails.

3046
03:26:33,228 --> 03:26:36,751
[SPEAKER_04]: Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com or Twitter.com slash OLR.

3047
03:26:36,811 --> 03:26:38,432
[SPEAKER_04]: We would really, really appreciate it.

3048
03:26:39,072 --> 03:26:39,312
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

3049
03:26:40,808 --> 03:26:41,849
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

3050
03:26:58,330 --> 03:27:01,552
[SPEAKER_02]: and the first few songs from Michael Jackson that will be in the game.

3051
03:27:01,572 --> 03:27:08,555
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, Bad, Beat It, Billie Jean, The Earth Song, The Girl Is Mine, Who Is It, and Workin' Day and Night.

3052
03:27:09,395 --> 03:27:11,396
[SPEAKER_02]: Workin' Day and Night is the only one I don't recognize.

3053
03:27:13,617 --> 03:27:15,898
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure I've heard it, I just don't recognize it by the title.

3054
03:27:17,259 --> 03:27:28,667
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, so that's it, and they have some really stupid looking, you know how they do those lifestyle shots where they have, like, someone playing the game, and they show, like, you know, what it looks like on screen?

3055
03:27:28,987 --> 03:27:30,909
[SPEAKER_02]: This guy looks like a douche, so.

3056
03:27:31,950 --> 03:27:34,551
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I want to play this game, because I don't want to be that douchey guy.

3057
03:27:34,692 --> 03:27:38,574
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of am curious, just, I'm curious just to see what it is.

3058
03:27:38,815 --> 03:27:41,797
[SPEAKER_04]: I might play it once in a dark room when nobody can see me.

3059
03:27:42,341 --> 03:28:01,288
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I was going to mention there's a game called MiniTroid that is, I don't know if it's out yet or it's possibly being worked on, but it's basically a remake or demake of Metroid 2, but it's a browser game and it's really cute looking.

3060
03:28:01,368 --> 03:28:08,390
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of small, but I don't think it's been released yet, but it is coming.

3061
03:28:11,529 --> 03:28:12,652
[SPEAKER_02]: IndieGames.com

3062
03:28:24,619 --> 03:28:27,762
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate it when I have to find something and it's like four links in.

3063
03:28:28,142 --> 03:28:30,004
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really annoying.

3064
03:28:30,144 --> 03:28:30,624
[SPEAKER_02]: It's alright.

3065
03:28:31,585 --> 03:28:38,831
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, speaking of annoying, I also saw that apparently they're going to be selling some Empire Strikes Back furniture for home.

3066
03:28:39,532 --> 03:28:41,373
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, like I'm going to buy that shit.

3067
03:28:42,414 --> 03:28:46,157
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we stop getting all this crap in home and start getting a use for the clubs?

3068
03:28:47,118 --> 03:28:48,219
[SPEAKER_04]: Just throwing that out there.

3069
03:28:48,739 --> 03:28:49,440
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to bring that out.

3070
03:28:49,480 --> 03:28:51,922
[SPEAKER_04]: Every time home gets brought up, I'm going to knock the clubs.

3071
03:28:53,973 --> 03:28:54,353
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

3072
03:28:54,453 --> 03:28:55,954
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I have to talk about.

3073
03:28:56,694 --> 03:28:57,094
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

3074
03:28:58,755 --> 03:29:01,656
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go ahead and start to wrap up the show then.

3075
03:29:01,936 --> 03:29:03,616
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to be on out of here for the night.

3076
03:29:03,717 --> 03:29:08,058
[SPEAKER_04]: Really appreciate you guys joining us though after our brief little hiatus or what have you.

3077
03:29:08,598 --> 03:29:10,399
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to wrap up, get everybody's final thought.

3078
03:29:10,459 --> 03:29:12,040
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm assuming you had no more last minute stories.

3079
03:29:12,320 --> 03:29:14,420
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I'm just dealing with some hate in the chat room.

3080
03:29:15,361 --> 03:29:16,021
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm dealing with it.

3081
03:29:16,352 --> 03:29:17,592
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, because I'm trying to do a show.

3082
03:29:19,193 --> 03:29:20,113
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, Alan?

3083
03:29:21,174 --> 03:29:28,716
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I'm a big City of Heroes fan, there's a second expansion, Going Rogue, available in stores last week on Tuesday.

3084
03:29:29,316 --> 03:29:30,517
[SPEAKER_14]: You can get it at Best Buy for $29.95.

3085
03:29:31,057 --> 03:29:37,779
[SPEAKER_14]: It is not an upgrade, so you can buy the new game as it is, just for that price, and it comes with a free month.

3086
03:29:38,620 --> 03:29:45,542
[SPEAKER_14]: And it lets you do a character that you can switch sides and become a villain or a mercenary, and there's a whole new world in there to explore.

3087
03:29:45,982 --> 03:29:46,402
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cool.

3088
03:29:46,422 --> 03:29:47,422
[SPEAKER_14]: I haven't checked it out yet, though.

3089
03:29:47,442 --> 03:29:48,683
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you gotta check that out.

3090
03:29:48,943 --> 03:29:50,423
[SPEAKER_04]: You're a big City Heroes fan, I know.

3091
03:29:50,843 --> 03:29:54,564
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I played it from launch for about three years, took some time off, and then came back.

3092
03:29:54,944 --> 03:29:56,344
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you went to go play WoW with your boyfriend.

3093
03:29:56,364 --> 03:29:57,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and I won WoW.

3094
03:29:57,464 --> 03:29:57,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Sucker.

3095
03:29:58,264 --> 03:29:58,544
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

3096
03:29:59,925 --> 03:30:03,285
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, I think it's about time we go around and give everybody's final thoughts.

3097
03:30:03,745 --> 03:30:10,486
[SPEAKER_04]: So, well, Alan, I will start with you, and thank you very much for being here tonight, and I hope you had fun, and come back again.

3098
03:30:10,546 --> 03:30:11,127
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure you will.

3099
03:30:11,567 --> 03:30:11,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

3100
03:30:11,907 --> 03:30:13,327
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

3101
03:30:14,887 --> 03:30:15,308
[SPEAKER_04]: Not really.

3102
03:30:15,829 --> 03:30:16,410
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel icky.

3103
03:30:16,911 --> 03:30:17,352
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

3104
03:30:17,412 --> 03:30:19,135
[SPEAKER_04]: Feel better.

3105
03:30:19,215 --> 03:30:21,058
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, I hate to interrupt you.

3106
03:30:21,098 --> 03:30:24,725
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you're working busy over there, but do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

3107
03:30:25,426 --> 03:30:25,967
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't be a hater.

3108
03:30:27,642 --> 03:30:29,542
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I saw a license plate today that was really funny.

3109
03:30:29,942 --> 03:30:33,363
[SPEAKER_04]: It was, you know how you can put symbols in the California license plate now?

3110
03:30:33,703 --> 03:30:36,124
[SPEAKER_04]: They had the little hand, like, making the stop sign.

3111
03:30:36,164 --> 03:30:38,364
[SPEAKER_04]: It said, stop, and then haters.

3112
03:30:38,764 --> 03:30:40,204
[SPEAKER_04]: So it looked like it said, stop, haters.

3113
03:30:41,644 --> 03:30:41,925
[SPEAKER_04]: It was funny.

3114
03:30:41,945 --> 03:30:42,265
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great.

3115
03:30:42,645 --> 03:30:50,126
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, my final thought tonight is, I don't know, I am excited to work a short work week next week.

3116
03:30:50,206 --> 03:30:51,266
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay, short work weeks.

3117
03:30:51,906 --> 03:30:54,247
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, I'll give you the final thought tonight.

3118
03:30:54,267 --> 03:30:55,727
[SPEAKER_04]: It's your first show back, so...

3119
03:30:56,944 --> 03:31:04,952
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm tired and I'm trying to get another, or not another, but I'm trying to still get an Xbox 360 dev kit.

3120
03:31:05,632 --> 03:31:09,776
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have like two people that are possibly going to sell one to me.

3121
03:31:10,017 --> 03:31:12,739
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just waiting for them to respond back.

3122
03:31:14,681 --> 03:31:15,002
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

3123
03:31:15,782 --> 03:31:18,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you have a wonderful night, everybody.

3124
03:31:18,247 --> 03:31:23,036
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much for downloading and listening to our show, whether it be live or whether it be via podcast.

3125
03:31:23,056 --> 03:31:24,078
[SPEAKER_04]: We really appreciate it.

3126
03:31:24,719 --> 03:31:26,783
[SPEAKER_04]: All we ask you guys, we don't have any advertising.

3127
03:31:26,803 --> 03:31:28,506
[SPEAKER_04]: Just tell two people about our show.

3128
03:31:28,942 --> 03:31:33,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Help us spread the word about Orange Lounge Radio and yeah, that's really all we ask you guys.

3129
03:31:34,224 --> 03:31:39,345
[SPEAKER_04]: Just help us spread the word because we can't really pay for a lot of advertising except maybe like a $10 Facebook ad here and there.

3130
03:31:40,045 --> 03:31:41,166
[SPEAKER_04]: So we really appreciate it, you guys.

3131
03:31:41,226 --> 03:31:44,847
[SPEAKER_04]: Leave us a nice iTunes review if you would or whatever you can do.

3132
03:31:45,187 --> 03:31:45,947
[SPEAKER_04]: Help us spread the word.

3133
03:31:46,187 --> 03:31:47,908
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be back here to do it all again next week.

3134
03:31:47,948 --> 03:31:49,228
[SPEAKER_04]: We really appreciate it, you guys.

3135
03:31:49,528 --> 03:31:51,129
[SPEAKER_04]: Have an awesome, awesome week.

3136
03:31:51,389 --> 03:31:54,070

3137
03:31:54,170 --> 03:31:54,470
[SPEAKER_04]: Good night.

3138
03:31:55,370 --> 03:31:55,930
