00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Who's your hosts?

00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Dark Sakura, Sky, and Loku

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Tonight, August 22nd, 2010

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
A new drawing tablet is announced for the Wii

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Goldeneye is set to get Golden Wii accessories

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And could a recent PC cult classic be coming to Xbox Live and PSN?

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Orange Lounge Radio

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello my friends on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We are that show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
We like to think of ourselves as the place where every gamer has a voice

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my awesome co-hosts

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Yo, what up?

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
How are you doing, Jamie Summers?

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
My head is a nightmare of pain

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm sorry to hear that, you seem to be in a relatively good mood tonight, all things considered

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Yeah, it's just, it's like, you wanna know, it's not really like a headache

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It's like being, having sore muscles in my head

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Interesting, and what else do the voices in your head tell you?

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Tell me to punch you in the face, no I'm kidding

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
It tells me that Dan's three bean salad is amazing and you should have some

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I may have to a little later, when I'm finished downing these yummy parmesan, garlic, and herb pita chips

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
that I managed to eat the entire bag over the course of a week

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
We should totally take a picture of you modeling them, Rob

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Perhaps I will in a moment

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Maybe later, then the whole chat can see my Journey shirt

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Of course, when Dark Sakura talks about taking pictures, they usually go right to our website

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
if you don't already know about it, www.orangeloungeradio.com

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'm trying to think what else is on orangeloungeradio.com for them to look at

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Occasionally a story will be posted, what? That my phone is in the bedroom and I'm too lazy to go get it

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Well, I guess that segment of the show just got shot, didn't it?

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
No, I'll go get the camera in a minute

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Canceled due to laziness

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'll go get the camera in a minute

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Which by the way, speaking of which, did you miss us last week everybody?

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
We're back after a week off

38
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Last week was cancelled due to gay

39
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Yes actually, partially it was

40
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Although I wouldn't say Loki's baby is a part of that

41
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
But yeah, I was at a Lady Gaga concert, what? And what?

42
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Judge me, I don't care

43
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm not, because I've had a change of heart

44
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
We can talk about that later

45
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
But I want to introduce, because he's back, we've missed him

46
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
He's been gone for a few weeks, but he is back in the house tonight

47
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Say hello to Loki

48
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Hello

49
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Techmaster Loki, how are you doing?

50
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm fine

51
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Tell us about the baby, we all want to know

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
He's not doing much, he just pretty much sleeps and poops and eats and that's about it

53
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
And he's awake every now and then for a few hours

54
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
But we've been trying to get him to sleep a little bit better at night

55
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
He looks like it's kind of funny, at night he doesn't sleep too deeply

56
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
And looks like he makes all these arm and leg movements

57
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
So it looks like he's fighting somebody in his sleep

58
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It's kind of funny

59
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Hopefully it's not his father

60
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
No, he's just like, and kicking his legs up and stuff

61
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Interesting

62
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Has he resisted the swaddling?

63
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
He doesn't like to be swaddled, really

64
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Neither did Becky's son

65
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
They always say that babies should be swaddled when they're really young

66
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I've seen more babies than not, just completely hate it

67
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It's so weird that everybody has babies now

68
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
He liked it at first, I think he gets hot

69
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
He takes after me, so we run really warm

70
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:35,000
And it's not fun to have a tight blanket on you when you're really hot

71
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
There was one picture of him that I have to say, he looked like a little monkey

72
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
He does look like a little monkey, he also looks like

73
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Oh, what's his name?

74
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
One of the kids from Malcolm in the Middle

75
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Wow

76
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Dewey, he looks like Dewey from Malcolm in the Middle

77
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Let's go to our chatroom at chat.orangelaungeradio.com

78
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Where our chatters can chat with us live as we do tape Sunday nights at All Games Radio

79
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
www.allgames.com is where you can listen to our show live

80
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
We do tape 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at All Games Radio

81
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
But if you want to chat live during the show, you gotta go to a different website

82
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
chat.orangelaungeradio.com

83
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
And that's our thing, where every gamer has a voice

84
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
You know, yeah, we talk about news, but I'm sure most of you that go to the trouble to download gaming blogs

85
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Or download gaming podcasts probably also read gaming blogs

86
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
So I know you get your news from there, but we talk about it with you guys and get some different perspectives

87
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
But tonight, it's a lot of questions about Loki

88
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Toygak says, holy shit, I missed you

89
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I don't know if he's talking about the show in general or Loki or both or what, but there you go

90
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Spazinator says, you were gone? LOLJK

91
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
DJ Dark Knight says, where's our cigars?

92
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I don't know, is that a tradition people still do anymore?

93
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I thought after all the whole smoking kills stuff

94
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You know, and they really frown on smoking in general, they don't do the cigars so much anymore

95
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I've seen candy cigars, but not the real ones

96
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
That's dumb

97
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Bobby Black Wolf, the man who does the show before us here at All Games Radio

98
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Has a great question, does he appreciate the nursery?

99
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
He doesn't really use the nursery yet because he's still sleeping in our room in a little portable crib

100
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
He will eventually use the nursery

101
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
No, not yet, he does not appreciate the nursery yet

102
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I don't think he can even see the nursery yet

103
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Really only can see about 8 to 12 inches in front of him

104
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Because his eyes aren't fully developed yet

105
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
He can see red though

106
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
He can see red, there's not much red in that room though

107
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
But yeah, so he doesn't quite appreciate it yet

108
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Our friends though, their son who's like a year and three months now

109
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
He loves that room, he just goes in and is like ahhhh

110
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
And just like, goes crazy

111
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
So yeah, I'm sure he will appreciate it later on

112
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
He's just, he's a little young right now

113
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Were you here the week we talked about how your pictures got on a gaming blog

114
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Or was that the night Josh was born?

115
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I think that was the week that Josh was born

116
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Yeah, your pictures made it onto what, Game Informer?

117
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Some pretty big magazine

118
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
And we were kind of like laughing because

119
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It had nothing to do with the fact that you're here on Orange Launch Radio

120
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Which you know, it's fine, nobody listens to the show

121
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Except the few faithful folks we've had over the years

122
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
But you just cracked me up because they found your photos on Flickr

123
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
And thought it made for a good story

124
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
But I think that just goes to show like

125
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Yeah sure, a lot of people may have thought of doing a Mario themed nursery for their babies

126
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
But Matt took the full effort with it

127
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It went all out

128
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I still haven't finished his mobile yet, but

129
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Like I said, I'm not really in a hurry because he's not using his crib yet

130
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
He's not going to learn to appreciate it for a little while

131
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Nah, he doesn't really care about mobiles and stuff like that right now

132
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I mean, he's got his swing, has little animals dangling from it

133
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
He could care less

134
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
He'll never realize what cool parents he has

135
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Doing his room in the video game theme, you know

136
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Because like, by the time he's a teenager

137
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Well, obviously the room will be changed by the time he's a teenager

138
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
By the time he's like, you know

139
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It's time for that nursery theme to be changed

140
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
He'll probably be like, man, video games are lame

141
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
All my parents, or all my dad does is talk about video games

142
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
No, he won't do that

143
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I'm just messing

144
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Alright, look, he's spoiled because he'll be like

145
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Oh, and they're like, oh man, I really wish I had like a Wii 2 or something

146
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Be like, ah, I already got that

147
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I bought that for myself

148
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
But hey, you can use it if you want, you know

149
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
He'll never get to play them because his dad will always be using it

150
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
He's like, hey, I want to play this game, got it for you

151
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Alright, we got to introduce somebody else here in the studio

152
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Because he's been so good and patient

153
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Sitting there for like seven minutes

154
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
While we've been doing the intro to the show

155
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
But he's here in studio, and you've heard him before

156
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
He's here, it's Alan, also known as Salacious Pop

157
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Is joining us in the studio tonight

158
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Hello everyone

159
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Oh, what a weekend I've had

160
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I'm hanging in there

161
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Tell us about it, because your weekend and my weekend were very similar

162
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Yes, we had a road trip up to Reno

163
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Because the Rocky Horror Troop that Rob is a part of

164
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Was doing a Rocky Horror performance

165
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
For about

166
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
3, 500 people we think

167
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
The number is still debated

168
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Like, I've heard everywhere from 2,000

169
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
To 6,800

170
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
And they do it in an arena

171
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
It's definitely the largest showing they do regularly

172
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
In the country

173
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I think there was once a large, large, large show in LA

174
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
But, I mean, this is the largest regular show they do

175
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Where it's literally thousands of people

176
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
And honestly, at that point

177
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
2,500, 6,800

178
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Looks all the same to me

179
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
It's a lot of fun

180
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
So, I'd never been to Reno before

181
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
So I was really excited to

182
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Go gamble a little bit

183
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
And I came down

184
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
With food poisoning

185
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
And was sick as a dog

186
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
For a day and a half

187
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
While we were up there

188
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I know, and I was worried that you were going to get

189
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
That whole associated response thing with Reno

190
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
So the next time I said, hey, let's go to Reno

191
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
You'd just think about, like, barfing

192
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
And you'd be like, no, I don't want to go

193
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I started to feel kind of

194
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Fluish and crappy during the car ride up

195
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
And I'm like, alright, 3 hour car ride, change in elevation

196
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I just feel kind of icky

197
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Hit the buffet, no, my stomach was like

198
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
That was a bad plan

199
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
That was your first mistake

200
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
You didn't condition yourself with enough junk food

201
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Beforehand, see

202
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
You can't go to

203
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Really anywhere in Nevada

204
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
And not have a buffet at some point

205
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Unless you live there

206
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I'm sure we have plenty of listeners in Las Vegas

207
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Going, ugh, I'm sick of fucking

208
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Hearing about buffets

209
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
They suck, they're terrible

210
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
They can shut up because they have Krispy Kreme

211
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
And Krispy Kreme is awesome

212
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
And I wish we still had it here

213
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Instead of it's going to be what

214
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
What were they turning into, a Chick-fil-A?

215
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
A Panera bread

216
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
A Panera, screw it

217
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Put it back to being

218
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
A Krispy Kreme again

219
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I didn't care less about Panera

220
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
That building's been empty for like 3 years

221
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
It's been a very long time

222
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
It's longer than 3 years

223
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Finally they're putting a Panera bread in there

224
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I like Panera bread, I think they're a really good

225
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Healthy place to eat

226
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I don't like them because they're egg sandwiches

227
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
They don't scramble their eggs

228
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
They just kind of fry it

229
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
And then you get chunks of

230
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
If it's egg salad, it shouldn't be

231
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Did you say egg or egg salad?

232
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
No, they're breakfast sandwiches with eggs on them

233
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
By the way, once in a while

234
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
We do stop talking about food and start talking about video games

235
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Just once you know it's not a Food Network podcast

236
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
It's a game podcast

237
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
If they had scrambled their eggs, it'd be

238
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
An even distribution between the yolk and the white

239
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
And the problem is, when you fry it like that

240
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
You get these big chunks of yolk

241
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
And it doesn't taste very good

242
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Plus they don't season anything

243
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
And it's terrible

244
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Really wish it was a Krispy Kreme again

245
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Next time, if you really want

246
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
One of these nights, when I come back from the Bay Area

247
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I'll have to do it when Jamie's not looking

248
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Because she'll be mad

249
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
That's awesome

250
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
From the Bay Area, because they still have them there

251
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
You know what, I want

252
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
One Krispy Kreme in particular

253
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Which one?

254
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
So you say the Cheesecake Donut

255
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
As much as I like them

256
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
My favorite to this day is

257
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Still the Eclair

258
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Because I do love the custard

259
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I might have to think about doing that

260
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Is there one on the way home for me?

261
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I think there is

262
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
You should just take me to the Bay Area

263
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Would you just take you?

264
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Just take me there

265
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
There's one near me in Daly City

266
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I don't know where you would stay for the night

267
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I mean, you can't sleep in the bed with

268
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
What?

269
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Okay, you're gonna lonely roam the streets

270
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Alright, anyhow

271
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I'll be driving around singing Journey songs

272
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Act F in our chatroom says

273
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
It isn't OLR without Orange Lounge Foodie-O

274
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Don't you know it

275
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Monty Boggs says

276
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I click off once they stop talking about food

277
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
They would be heaven

278
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I'm sure there is a donut buffet somewhere

279
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
There's gotta be

280
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
That would be kind of dangerous

281
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Now I've heard about this thing

282
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I'm just perpetuating the food thing

283
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I've heard about this thing now where they're making hamburgers

284
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Out of Krispy Kreme donuts

285
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
The Luther

286
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
There's a name for these?

287
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
It's because they figured out that website

288
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
ThisIsWhyYoureFat.com

289
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
And people are like

290
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
That's really bad for you

291
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
And then we get publication

292
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Because people talk about it

293
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
And how crazy it is

294
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
It's ridiculous

295
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
It's a trend that I wish would go away

296
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
There was an episode of the Boondocks

297
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
On Cartoon Network

298
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Specifically about the grandpa opening up a soul food restaurant

299
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
With the Luther

300
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Wow

301
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
It seems like one of those foods

302
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
You get at the State Fair

303
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
The State Fair is the home of

304
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Terribly bad for you food

305
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I'll just make a deep fried hamburger

306
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I don't know

307
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Take the whole hamburger

308
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
You've had a Monte Cristo before

309
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Is that what they call it?

310
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Yeah

311
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I tried to get Rob to order one

312
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Even when he described it

313
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
It was a deep fried ham and cheese sandwich

314
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
It's thick sourdough toast

315
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
With ham and Swiss

316
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
And then it's dipped in a sweet batter

317
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Deep fried

318
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
And then served with strawberry jam and powdered sugar

319
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
It's ham and cheese

320
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
French toast with crap on it

321
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
There's a lot of things I don't like about that

322
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I don't like crap on my French toast

323
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Other than maybe powdered sugar

324
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
And I really don't like powdered sugar if I can get it without it

325
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I don't really care for jams

326
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
And jellies and stuff like that

327
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
And also I hate Swiss

328
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
He's quite a picky eater

329
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I am a picky eater

330
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Swiss is one of the lowest sodium cheeses

331
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Also random

332
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I saw that on the menu

333
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Of course there are still Bennigan's

334
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
What they need to do is they need to take a burger

335
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Bread it in the pub

336
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Is that what it's called?

337
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I don't know what Bennigan's is

338
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I've seen it

339
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I've never been there

340
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Didn't we go at California Extreme?

341
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
No we went to IHOP

342
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
No we went to Bennigan's and then IHOP

343
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
You guys went to Bennigan's during the day

344
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Dan and I showed up later

345
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
We went to Bennigan's

346
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I'm sorry I'm distracted

347
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I'm trying to get into how is your gaming week

348
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
But I have to ask Darsakra

349
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
She likes to surf the web during this show

350
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
She's on Facebook right now looking at pictures of Carol Channing

351
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
What?

352
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
The company that I work at

353
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
That I'm about to get laid off of

354
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I found my boss's Facebook page

355
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
My first boss who hired me

356
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
And I'm looking at his photos of him

357
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
He was Carol Channing?

358
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
You were hired by Carol Channing?

359
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Do you like raspberries?

360
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Hired!

361
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
But he's the world's biggest Ann-Margret fan

362
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
And he's also

363
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
He's gone to her house

364
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Got tons of photos

365
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
He and his partner

366
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Have met

367
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Her and her husband

368
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
And gone to shows

369
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
And sat in box seats

370
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
But I'm also looking at his other photos

371
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Of other celebrities that he's met

372
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
And there's like him and Carol Channing

373
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
And Bo Derek and that's pretty cool

374
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
He's gonna be really sad in about 10 years

375
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Wish I had pictures

376
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
With all the celebrities I've met

377
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I have a picture

378
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
With um

379
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
My rock star hero

380
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Mr. Castlevania himself

381
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Good times

382
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Yeah, with his wild hair

383
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
And him being taller than me

384
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
And looking absolutely like he was gonna pee himself

385
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
When I asked him in Japanese if I could have a photo

386
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
You were there for that

387
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I was, I think I took the photo

388
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Yes you did

389
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
And since Dark Sakura brought up Castlevania

390
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I'll use it as a segue to finally talk about games

391
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
So Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

392
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Or two weeks if you wish

393
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I really didn't play much of anything

394
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I played a little pinball

395
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
And mostly I watched Dan scream

396
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
At his Nintendo emulator

397
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Well today I watched him yell

398
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
At Rad Racer

399
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
But I wanted to hear the music

400
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
And the doo doo doo doo doo doo doo

401
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
The one that was used in the

402
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
The Strong Bad

403
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Anime one

404
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Anyway

405
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Then Dan played some Turbo Out Run

406
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
And Out Runners

407
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
It was old school racing to hear it

408
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Fuck it and turn it off

409
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
And

410
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I found my Ninja Pass

411
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
But I couldn't find my SD

412
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
My micro SD card

413
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I think those are pretty cheap to come by

414
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Yeah, I ordered one for five bucks

415
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
But the whole reason I wanted it

416
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Is because since I'm going back to the gym

417
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
My favorite thing to do is to go

418
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Well, back in the day it was go on the elliptical

419
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
And play Pokemans

420
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
So now it's gonna be

421
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I guess play whatever

422
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Game I happen to have on me

423
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
And I wanted to find some of those

424
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
SNES ROM conversions

425
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
For the DSI

426
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Nice

427
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
And then I can play lots and lots of Seiken 3

428
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Because that's been the game

429
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I've really been wanting to get into

430
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Or just Final Fantasy 6, 3, whatever you want

431
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I have a new game that I'm going to be playing

432
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Thank you to a lack of forgetfulness

433
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Finally, after like a month

434
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I finally remember to bring Dark Sakura

435
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Final Fantasy 13

436
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Yeah, I really should finish that game

437
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I'll be playing the crap out of this

438
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
And I start school next week too

439
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Good times, you're gonna be busy

440
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
And Tuesday is old school DDR night

441
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
At Arviggle

442
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Yes, I'm gonna go

443
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I don't know if I'll actually play Ditter

444
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
But I'll definitely play some 2DX

445
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
And if they ever

446
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Fix their frickin' Technica machine

447
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I'll play that too

448
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Alright

449
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Maybe I'll play like

450
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
One round of DDR

451
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
That would be fun, I haven't done that forever

452
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
But I'm almost afraid to try again

453
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Just because last time

454
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
That's cause I still think

455
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
It's humbling, you're gonna have to

456
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Go down to 5 footers to like get yourself

457
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Back into it

458
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I've been playing 6's and 7's and it's been

459
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Fun for me

460
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
It's humbling, cause you'll be all like

461
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
What was that one song, it's like a 9 footer

462
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
It's really fast, the heavenly something

463
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Angelic mix

464
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Oh, Healing Vision Angelic mix, that's it right?

465
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
It's one of those really fast

466
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Songs that you dance to in DDR

467
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
And it's like super fast 9 footer

468
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Back when I was in my younger

469
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
20's when DDR first came out

470
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Or I guess when Max first came out

471
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I was able to pass that song after a little bit of practice

472
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
But it didn't almost give me

473
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Like a heart attack like it did when I tried it

474
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I couldn't even finish it

475
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
It's insane. Well you remember back in the day

476
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I could play tons of stuff

477
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
And now, but this is

478
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
How I look at it is

479
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I've got those shiny

480
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Sort of old

481
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Dance pads I picked up at the thrift store

482
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I'm gonna start playing again

483
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I've had no

484
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
There's no excuse for me to have

485
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Just not done it

486
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I am really curious about this DDR

487
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I need to bring this up at some point

488
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Because I don't think it's in the show or otherwise

489
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
They had the Dance Dance Revolution preview

490
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Party this past week

491
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
None of us went, but my buddy Mel

492
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Who you guys all know Mel B

493
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
If you've been listening to the show long enough

494
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
He's been on before, he went

495
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
The pictures looked fun

496
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Think DJ Tyrant who does sometimes an article

497
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Or here or there for our website, he went too

498
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
And they said, well dance

499
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Masters was clearly

500
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
The game to play there

501
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
That was a lot of fun

502
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
But the DDR for the PS3

503
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Eh, the move stuff is kind of gimmicky

504
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
But otherwise, it's a pretty decent

505
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
DDR game and the song list looks

506
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Really cool, like it's got a lot of really good songs

507
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
In it I gotta say

508
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I liked the machine they had there

509
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Yeah, there's a new X2 is now coming out

510
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
He said that was a sweet song list

511
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
And they fixed the dance pads, they're not so crappy anymore

512
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Because X had really bad dance pads

513
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
They got DDRX at Dave and Buster's in town

514
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I had to laugh

515
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Sorry to interrupt

516
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Because you mentioned Mel B

517
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I had to laugh because I've been seeing this on my release list

518
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
And I finally found the box art for it

519
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
They have a game coming out in the week called

520
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Get Fit with Mel B

521
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Apparently there's a woman named Mel B

522
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
It's Scary Spice

523
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
That's who that is

524
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
That's Scary Spice, Mel B

525
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Sorry

526
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Go power blah blah blah

527
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I'm Mel B

528
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I'm the runner up on Dancing with the Stars

529
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
On the internet, doesn't know who I am

530
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
At any rate

531
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Dan and I are having our fifth wedding anniversary

532
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Oh

533
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
And we were gonna

534
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Get folks together on the day before

535
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Because we can't do the $40

536
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Free play thing all day thing

537
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
On our actual anniversary

538
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
So we were gonna go and

539
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Hit up Dave and Buster's and have like a big party

540
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
With whoever wants to show up

541
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
What day is this?

542
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
31st

543
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
It'll be August 31st

544
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I should be here

545
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
And the first is our actual fifth year anniversary

546
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
And the second is when my conversion goes through

547
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Oh wow

548
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
When do you do the whole um

549
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
The dip on the second

550
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Oh wow

551
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Fun dip

552
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Good times

553
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
And then I will be shiny and new

554
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
And then you are officially

555
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Yes

556
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
One of the chosen people at that point right?

557
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
One of the chosen people

558
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Congrats in advance

559
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Well somehow we completely deviated

560
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
From the talk of video games

561
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
What did we hit on in there?

562
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Jews, Spice Girls

563
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
No but anyway

564
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Loki

565
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I haven't been playing a whole lot

566
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
You got a good excuse

567
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I'm trying to think back to what I played at the hospital

568
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
On the DS

569
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I don't even know if I played anything on the DS

570
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I played a little bit more of

571
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Spirit Tracks

572
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
That game is okay

573
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I just

574
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Some of the Zelda games on the DS

575
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I just don't go through them very quickly

576
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
But it's alright

577
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Then mainly

578
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
The only thing I've been playing since I got back to work

579
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Has been

580
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
The Grand Theft Auto Lost and Damned

581
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Yes we've gone back to Lost and Damned now

582
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Because they were kind of craving

583
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
The open world Grand Theft Auto

584
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Deathmatch things

585
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
And since you can't really do that

586
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
In the Battle of the Gay Tony

587
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
We're playing Lost and Damned

588
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
It's actually a little bit more fun

589
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
It's a little less serious

590
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Because I'm not really trying to get up on the leaderboards

591
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
For that

592
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I kind of want to go back to the Battle of the Gay Tony

593
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
So I can actually get to the top of the leaderboards

594
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Because I kind of stopped at rank 59

595
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
But then on top of all that

596
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I've been working still on

597
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Working on my mods and stuff

598
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
For Grand Theft Auto

599
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Because I have a really big one in the works

600
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Right now that's going to be

601
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Completely

602
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Stuff that's never been done before

603
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
On the console version

604
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
And thankfully I

605
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Upgraded my computer to Windows

606
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
7 64 bit

607
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
And added another 4 gigs of RAM

608
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
So now it runs smoothly

609
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
And I can actually run Grand Theft Auto

610
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
After having it crash after 5 minutes

611
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
There was something weird with the installation

612
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Or something on XP

613
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
So now it's really stable

614
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Which is great and I can actually work on it

615
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Lots of baby jokes in the chatroom

616
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Spaznator wants to know if you've been playing Babymaker Extreme

617
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
No

618
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Frisbee says Loki has been playing lots of Imagine Babies

619
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
No

620
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
It's just

621
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Just been playing reality babies

622
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Just been playing washing the bottles

623
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Changing the diapers

624
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Good times

625
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Fun stuff like that

626
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Because now

627
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
With the sleep schedule and everything

628
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
We have to get up a lot of times

629
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I kind of have to stick to the old person schedule

630
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Where I have to go to bed at 9 o'clock

631
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
At night

632
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Well it's been 11

633
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
11 o'clock at night is really what we've been sticking to

634
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
But sometimes 9 o'clock at night

635
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Or 10

636
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Between 9 and 11

637
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Because I have to get up in the morning like at 5 in the morning

638
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
You know with the babies

639
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
So

640
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
That's how long it takes me to wake up

641
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Is about 2 hours with the baby and stuff

642
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
And also on the weekends

643
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
I wake up early with the baby

644
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
To try to take him out of the room

645
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
So if he's fussing

646
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Nelly can sleep some

647
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
With all that and having to change him

648
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
And do stuff every 3 hours

649
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
It really doesn't give me a lot of time to work on anything

650
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
So

651
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Gameplay and stuff

652
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I have a lot of stuff to play

653
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Including a lot of things I really shouldn't be playing

654
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I don't think anyone is surprised

655
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
That you haven't been able to play

656
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
A whole lot lately

657
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
We'll get into things I shouldn't be playing right

658
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
A little bit later

659
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
And then

660
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Yeah just lots of stuff to

661
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
To be doing

662
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
But I've been mainly just working on the Grand Theft Auto stuff

663
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Because that's what I play at work

664
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
And it's going to be so fun

665
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
When I mod things done

666
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
DarkSakura

667
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
You missed something you want to talk about in your week?

668
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
I played Star Trek Online

669
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Of course you always do. Anything exciting going on there?

670
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Dabo! The implemented Dabo

671
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
So you can gamble for Latinum

672
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
And they have Hololita

673
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
And they got Chase Masterson to do her voice

674
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Wow

675
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Lots of stuff in that game keeps growing over there

676
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Good times

677
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Alan! How you doing? How was your gaming week?

678
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Pretty uneventful

679
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I played the

680
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Castlevania Harmony of

681
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Schadenfreude or whatever the 360 version is

682
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
No I'm joking about the name

683
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
The multiplayer one

684
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
I played the demo of that, didn't like it

685
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Don't know why

686
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Playing as Alucard, upscaled HD graphics

687
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Castlevania

688
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Gave it two rounds

689
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
It's weird

690
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
It doesn't feel like other Castlevania games

691
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
I hear that the game really shines on its best

692
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
When it's multiplayer

693
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
No big surprise, most games are better

694
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
When it's multiplayer

695
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Playing it normal is really strange

696
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Especially the way the whole map

697
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Is zoomed out in the beginning

698
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Is just kind of a weird

699
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Weird feeling

700
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Some puzzle quests too, still working on that

701
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Can only play that

702
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
For maybe 30-45 minutes

703
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
At a time because

704
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
When you get to the lower levels

705
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
I'm almost at the max level

706
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
I'm level 43 out of 50

707
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I get to play so much freaking Bejeweled

708
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Just to clear a room, it kind of becomes a grind

709
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
And of course World of Warcraft

710
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Got some accomplishments

711
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Done in that

712
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
What are your biggest accomplishments in World of Warcraft so far?

713
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
50 mounts

714
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:29,000
And I finally grinded all five cities in Argent Tournament

715
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
So I got my super hella exalted Argent champion

716
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
With cheesecake achievement

717
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Does Blizzard actually mail you a cheesecake?

718
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
I hope so

719
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Because all those dailies, never again

720
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
I wanted to die

721
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Man, I would so play an MMO

722
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
If they sent you things in real life

723
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
For doing all the grinding

724
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I mean you're paying $14.95 a month

725
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Just to send a little cheap

726
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Can you imagine if you're suddenly in the mail one day

727
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Congratulations on your uber mount, here's a cheesecake

728
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
I want to play S.T.O. and have them send me

729
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Romulan ale or a warp core breach

730
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
That would be a great idea

731
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Davo, you win liquor

732
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
But you know there'd be people that would exploit the hell out of that

733
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
So they'd have to think of funny ways to put caps on it

734
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
But it's kind of like one of those loyalty programs

735
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Like what, Square Enix sends out what

736
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Like iPhones or no, iPod Touches or whatever

737
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
If you're like an uber platinum

738
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Bought every game we ever put out member or whatever

739
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
But yeah

740
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Anyhow

741
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,000
And our guild is now 6-12 of ICC

742
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Same guild I'm in of course

743
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
We got down Rotface and

744
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Festergut

745
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
And we're working on Valtheria

746
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Dreamwalker, Healy, Dragon

747
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Which probably was not the best idea for the next boss

748
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Which I don't like that fight at all

749
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
So I don't know, we're going back in tomorrow

750
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
So maybe we'll do the Blood Princes

751
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Is that what it is? The Blood Queen, the Princes

752
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Princes and then Queen is after them

753
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Yeah we gotta do that whole thing

754
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Wow wow wow

755
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I've been playing a lot of WoW 2 of course

756
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
All the same things he's been talking about

757
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Well actually no cause my accomplishments I don't have nearly the same stuff

758
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
I haven't done the uber stuff

759
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Alan's really good at focusing on one character

760
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
And I've got, I've started to develop

761
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
You know as the weight continues on

762
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
For Cataclysm, Ultihallism

763
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
And you know I've been leveling

764
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
A shaman which has been fun

765
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
And been slowly

766
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Working on my warrior

767
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Who was lulled at like 76 for the past

768
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Like 4 months, she's up to like 78 now

769
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
So I'll probably get her over the hill

770
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
To 80 at some point then I'll have another 80

771
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Outside of that though

772
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Another Blizzard game I've been playing a lot of

773
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
I finally played

774
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Starcraft 2

775
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Which is old news

776
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
To a lot of you guys you know

777
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Those of you that are huge fans of Starcraft

778
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Bought this game the day it came out I'm sure

779
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
But you might remember I was very apprehensive

780
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
About getting into Starcraft because

781
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
The RTS thing I find to be very

782
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Overwhelming especially when I see screenshots

783
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
For the game I'm like there's so much shit on the screen

784
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
How are you supposed to be able to manage all that

785
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
I don't understand this is too complicated

786
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
My feeble brain can't handle this

787
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Of course I mentioned a couple weeks on the show

788
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
I came to the realization that my ex-boyfriend

789
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Used to play Starcraft and he really

790
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Enjoyed it and was a big fan of it and I'm thinking

791
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
If that asshole can play then so can I

792
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
So I finally said you know what

793
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
I'm going to just suck it up and get Starcraft 2

794
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Because I have a lot of friends that play I'll figure it out

795
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
And I've been having a good time with it

796
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
It's actually

797
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Quite a bit of fun and it's not nearly as bad

798
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
As I thought it would be for learning

799
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
At least in the campaign

800
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
The campaign very clever

801
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
In the way it does it it works into the story

802
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Where like the first mission you don't even

803
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Build structures you're just kind of walking around

804
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
And learning how to engage in combat

805
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
And walk around second mission

806
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Okay now you're building structures and they

807
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Add little bits and pieces at a time

808
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Into this so the campaign is really cool

809
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
The way it's developed

810
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Multiplayer

811
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Not so noob friendly

812
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
I mean they've done some things

813
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
There's this whole practice league you can do

814
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
For a little while you can slow down the game

815
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
A lot I mean there are some things they've done

816
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
To help it be a little bit easier but

817
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
You know at the end of the day when you try to play

818
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
A human opponent it's it's it's tough

819
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
And

820
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Playing though against like the computer AI

821
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Depending on how you do it is

822
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Is cool like you know

823
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
A friend of mine from the WoW guild and I were playing

824
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Online the other night and we were playing

825
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Two versus two but we would slow down

826
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
The game and we played very

827
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Easy computer and it was almost too easy

828
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Like we whooped it like three times so we

829
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Said let's step it up to easy

830
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
And still we were able to conquer it

831
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
You know a little more difficult but not not too bad

832
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
So but then we played

833
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Like instead of a custom game

834
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
We actually played the regular co-op

835
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Mode that was like I don't know

836
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Some different mode where you couldn't change

837
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
The speed so the speed was

838
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Fast and we got annihilated

839
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
We got zerg literally

840
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
By because both computer opponents

841
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Happened to be zerg and we just got slaughtered

842
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
And it was really hard so

843
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
As long as I can play the game slow

844
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
I'm good and then or getting better

845
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
I should say and I know the

846
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Speed thing will come with time but

847
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Yeah so multiplayer has been a very interesting

848
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Experience but campaign is really cool

849
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
You know very animated very cool

850
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Little like decks that you go through on the ship

851
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
To kind of well you're not

852
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
You don't start there you actually start in a

853
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Different area but you move on to the ship

854
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
And you can kind of buy enhancements

855
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
And things which are really cool

856
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
So I like what they did there

857
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Where things get weird I think with starcraft

858
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Is that they made this

859
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Decision to put out three starcraft

860
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Games and they're gonna do I think the zerg game

861
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Is coming next and there's gonna be a protoss game

862
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Later on there what all

863
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Within the next year year and a half maybe

864
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
I don't remember how far apart these games are supposed to be

865
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
But they're all coming out and my question is

866
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
You know for 60 bucks

867
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
For this game I feel like I got

868
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
A pretty good deal there's a really

869
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Well fleshed out multiplayer game

870
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
There's a solid single player game in there

871
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
I'm a happy camper

872
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
But my question is in the next game

873
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Okay there's gonna be

874
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
A zerg campaign alright I get that

875
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
That'll be cool cause I'll actually get to learn how to play

876
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Zerg cause that's the other

877
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Problem I have with multiplayer right now is that

878
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Being that I am new to starcraft I didn't really

879
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Get into the first game

880
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
I don't know what I'm doing when I play

881
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Zerg or protoss I mean yeah I know

882
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
They have a lot of the similar stuff but I don't

883
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
I don't know it and there's no real easy

884
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Way to learn it so

885
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
I guess these other games might be an easy way

886
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
For me to learn it but for everybody else

887
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
That's super into starcraft

888
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
I don't know how they're gonna justify 60 dollars

889
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Just for a zerg campaign

890
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Doesn't seem like

891
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
There's gonna be enough there I mean

892
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
I'm imagining they'll just have to do a shit ton

893
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Of maps and some other enhancements

894
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
To multiplayer here and there

895
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Achievements I don't know but 60 dollars

896
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Is really gonna feel

897
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Like you're not getting the same

898
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Value out of the second game

899
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
So you do the first game and maybe

900
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Obviously it's probably a little early for me

901
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
To be saying something like that cause I haven't played

902
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
The second game but I just kinda look at it

903
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
And go what are they gonna add that's gonna

904
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Make it worth all that money cause multiplayer

905
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Is multi you know that's I don't see that changing

906
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
A whole lot

907
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
I wanna

908
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
I think I recall the blizzard developers saying

909
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Last year that when they announced that they were

910
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Doing three separate releases

911
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
That the campaigns the story modes for each

912
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Game is gonna be anywhere from

913
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
25 to 40 hours whatever is

914
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Considered a full game length

915
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Cause in Starcraft 1

916
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
All three campaigns together made up the game

917
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
So you're gonna be playing as the Terrans for

918
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
30 hours to get their whole story

919
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Zerg for 30 hours to get their whole campaign

920
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
So I guess they're really it's more like a trilogy

921
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
I guess in one

922
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Sequel but it's still gonna be really hard

923
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
After having plopped the money and

924
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Feeling that value from this first

925
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Game when I get that second game

926
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
If I don't feel that same value

927
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
I'm not gonna be pleased

928
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
If you don't care about lore really

929
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
And you're just in it for the multiplayer and the maps

930
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Which a lot of people are

931
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
30 hours of campaign even if it's like ooh let's

932
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
You know go into the heart of the politics of the Zerg

933
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
It's like yeah I don't care

934
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
That's 30 hours I could be working on my ranking in league mode

935
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Right? Yeah

936
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
So it's gonna be very interesting to see how they justify it

937
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
I think it's gonna be tough

938
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
But you know I don't know Blizzard

939
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Clearly they know what they're doing

940
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
They have much success on the PC

941
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
You know I'm really excited for Diablo 3

942
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
And obviously the new WoW expansion

943
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
But at this point

944
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
I kind of look at it and go

945
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
I don't know if this was the best decision

946
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
I mean from a money making perspective

947
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
It was but

948
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
They might do 60 bucks, 45 bucks, 45 bucks

949
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
They might take it down a notch

950
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
On the prize for the latter two

951
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
I wonder if they're gonna do the other two as expansions

952
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
To the first one so you have to buy the first game

953
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Ho ho

954
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Wow

955
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
I could see that

956
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
If the second and third games were just expansions

957
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
To the first game

958
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
That I get but that's not the way Blizzard's talking

959
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
So I don't know

960
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Alright anyhow

961
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
We're gonna get into some gaming news here

962
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Now that we're done with our gaming week

963
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
But first some housekeeping

964
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Not a whole lot of housekeeping I want to share tonight actually

965
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Please join our Facebook if you haven't already

Dot com we'll get to reading your emails

973
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
A little later in the show

974
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Otherwise not a lot of show

975
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
I mean we had last week off I don't see us having another show

976
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Off until

977
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Probably I know Halloween

978
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Is on a Sunday this year right so there probably

979
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Is not gonna be an alarm

980
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
I sent you a message about that

981
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
You did but I think it was when I was really intoxicated in Reno

982
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
That's something to discuss later

983
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Yes how I

984
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Drank so much in Reno that I actually fell out of the bed

985
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Oh no I meant Halloween but

986
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Oh uh

987
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
I just made that up

988
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
It's really funny huh

989
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Rob fell out of the bed

990
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Alright yeah we'll talk Halloween later

991
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
But otherwise we're set for a little while

992
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Alright uh or

993
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
I don't know about Labor Day weekend

994
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Because that's gonna be tough cause it's a three day weekend

995
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
We'll see

996
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Drunk show?

997
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
It's gonna be an idea actually

998
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
We haven't done that in a long long time

999
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
No we haven't

1000
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
I doubt Loki would be participating in that

1001
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Yeah I don't think I could

1002
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Does Dan drink at all? Can Dan drink?

1003
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
He's not big on it

1004
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
You know what we should do

1005
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
We should do the marathon episode of Orange Lounge Radio

1006
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Yes

1007
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Cause there's nothing on

1008
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
On All Games Radio after us

1009
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
And we should just honestly see

1010
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
And I don't know how the listeners will feel about this

1011
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
We should do the regular show

1012
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
And then we just go for it

1013
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Go as long as we possibly can

1014
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
I wonder if there's a Guinness Book of World Records

1015
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
For the world's longest podcast

1016
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
We wouldn't hit it

1017
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Because I know some of these people

1018
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Especially when they do the charity bus

1019
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
The desert bus

1020
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
That thing goes on for like a week

1021
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
But I'm talking about podcast

1022
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Even then I don't think we'd hit it in just 24 hours

1023
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
We'd have to take it two weeks time

1024
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
We'll add gaming podcast

1025
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
In front of that

1026
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
The longest episode of the official gaming podcast

1027
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Of the universe

1028
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
I'm looking at the chatroom

1029
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Chat.orangeloungeradio.com

1030
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Breakman in our chatroom

1031
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Just for the record says falling out of the bed

1032
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Is way better than falling off the toilet

1033
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Haven't done that

1034
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Let's see

1035
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
The chatroom says ooh drunk show

1036
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
And of course as always we would drink responsibly

1037
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
If we do have a drunk show then somebody else

1038
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Is gonna have to drive me here

1039
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
On the vault floor like Jamie's other

1040
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Houseguests do

1041
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
We'll figure that out

1042
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Tigerclaw says it'll be like an after birth XXL

1043
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Yeah something like that

1044
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Sj100matt says we should invite

1045
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Irene and Xtopher for this

1046
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
We definitely should try to get other people here

1047
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
If we do that

1048
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Maybe I'm onto something

1049
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
I'm not going out of town for Labor Day

1050
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
I usually do but I'm not this year

1051
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
That's actually in two weeks

1052
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
I plan on sitting on my ass

1053
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Are you available to come up here?

1054
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
I was gonna say if you're staying at home

1055
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
For Labor Day weekend I'm coming up here then

1056
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Maybe we'll do that

1057
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
If people feel like crashing

1058
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
So we can sleep in cycles

1059
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
We've got the futile mattresses

1060
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
In the vault

1061
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
I can make it into a comfortable little bed

1062
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
We have comfortable couches

1063
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
We'll figure something out

1064
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
That's in two weeks though

1065
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
I just realized oh crap that's in two weeks

1066
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
So next week we'll have an answer

1067
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
On what's gonna happen in two weeks

1068
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Alright in the meantime

1069
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
How about some actual bonafide gaming news

1070
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Loki I know you've missed the gaming news

1071
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
How are you doing?

1072
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Doing alright

1073
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
So there's a rumor going around saying that the brand new

1074
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Or I guess the next iteration

1075
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Of the PSP will have touch sensitive

1076
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Controls on the back of the system

1077
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Now this isn't that far fetched

1078
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Of an idea because if you've

1079
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Seen any of the

1080
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Shots of the PSP

1081
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
On the phone that's supposed to be coming out

1082
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
It actually has some sort of touch panels

1083
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
On the front of the unit

1084
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
I don't understand the back how that's really gonna

1085
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Work it seems a little awkward to me

1086
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
But I guess we'll see

1087
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Um

1088
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
And apparently this is coming from

1089
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
An unnamed source according

1090
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
To Eurogamer and

1091
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Um

1092
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
There's not really

1093
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Much to go on I guess other than

1094
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Saying that um

1095
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Apparently the device is gonna

1096
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Be roughly the size of the PSP 3000

1097
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
And um

1098
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
That looks like there's gonna be plenty

1099
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Of room left over for

1100
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
A physical media slot

1101
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
On it so

1102
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
None of this PSP go crap

1103
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Cause honestly that didn't sell very well at all

1104
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
I think they were super flimsy

1105
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Yeah

1106
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Guess what Sony apparently people do like to buy

1107
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Physical copies of their games

1108
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Who would have thought

1109
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Um

1110
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
So

1111
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
I don't know it'd be interesting to see

1112
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
If this really does anything

1113
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
I think they really should just stick with

1114
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Putting at least a second analog stick on there

1115
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Um cause the actual PSP

1116
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Phone thing um had

1117
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
This touch panel that would kind of replace

1118
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
The analog sticks

1119
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
And you could kind of use it like the analog sticks

1120
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Cause it was almost like a strip

1121
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Um which is an interesting idea I guess

1122
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
But

1123
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
I don't know

1124
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Hopefully the system will do a lot better than the

1125
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Last PSP so

1126
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
I don't think the last PSP oh well the PSP Go

1127
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Did terribly yes but the original

1128
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
You're not talking about the original PSP

1129
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
I'm talking about the original PSP it's not done well recently

1130
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Well compared to the DS but it's done

1131
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Better than a lot of systems do

1132
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
I would think

1133
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
What other systems are we talking about out there?

1134
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
The Lynx, the Game Gear, the

1135
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Gamescom, the uh

1136
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
What was that shitty little thing they showed off at E3

1137
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
A few years ago it was a portable device

1138
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
The Gizmodo? The Gizmodo

1139
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
The N-Gage, it's been better than all of those

1140
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
I like the little

1141
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Guitar game on the Gizmodo though

1142
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Barely though Gizmondo that was it

1143
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Gizmondo

1144
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Oh Gizmodo's a gaming block

1145
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Or something like that

1146
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
It's a dumb name for device anyways

1147
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Gizmondo

1148
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
But yeah it's just I don't know

1149
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
I don't see them doing too much

1150
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Stuff that's very different than the last

1151
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
PSP I think that

1152
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
The system's okay

1153
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
They just have to make a few enhancements to it

1154
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
And hopefully they'll learn from their mistakes

1155
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Um

1156
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
And I hope for their sake that it's a little more

1157
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Secure as far as cracking it goes

1158
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
No

1159
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Wait what adds value

1160
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
To these rumors? Cause rumors

1161
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Can you know kinda come from anywhere

1162
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Like I could say oh the next PSP is gonna double as a

1163
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Cigarette lighter woohoo you know there you go

1164
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
But uh

1165
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Cut, print, run with it

1166
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
PSP to have cigarette lighter

1167
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
But what adds this any value

1168
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
What they're saying here

1169
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Um

1170
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Honestly don't know

1171
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
So I guess we don't really know

1172
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
I mean for all we know this could be

1173
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Some sort of

1174
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Analyst talking about the system

1175
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
I don't know

1176
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Let's see here

1177
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
It's um

1178
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
According to three separate development sources

1179
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
That have seen the new PSP

1180
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
And

1181
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
They're saying that it's gonna

1182
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Have a touch sensitive area on the back of the

1183
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Unit behind the screen

1184
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Which is weird if you think

1185
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
About it I mean

1186
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
That's just awkward

1187
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
I mean if I'm gonna control a game and I'm

1188
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Touch screens on the back

1189
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Unless it like flips

1190
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Over or something so you can do like

1191
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Touch screen type games like the DS or something

1192
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
But

1193
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
I don't know

1194
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Going to our chatroom at chat.orangelandraday.com

1195
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Odd1 says I hope they keep the online

1196
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Functionality of the device, podcasting

1197
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Decent web browsing, shit was

1198
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Kind of cash you know and SD cards

1199
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Yeah um I kind of agree

1200
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
PSP's biggest strength wasn't necessarily

1201
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
The games that were on it but the fact it was kind of an all

1202
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
In one type of thing I mean minus the phone

1203
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
But you don't need a phone there

1204
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
They added their advantage definitely

1205
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
There but and the games were

1206
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Not bad I mean the games were good

1207
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
It's just for whatever reason

1208
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Well I know what the reason is

1209
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
You know they have rampant piracy

1210
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
And I'm sure that's affected their

1211
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Sales of different games

1212
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
And because of that now you don't have a lot of games being

1213
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Developed for the PSP just because it's not

1214
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Doing as well

1215
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
I don't think it was a

1216
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Terrible system at all but

1217
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
There's a few things that they could have fixed

1218
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Like you know the second analog stick would have been

1219
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Nice

1220
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Definitely think it should have at least two analog sticks

1221
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
And then as far as the controls

1222
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Go I think it's fine maybe add

1223
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Some you know an L2 R2

1224
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Button you know so it's more like

1225
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
The Playstation

1226
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
And that's about it that's all you really need

1227
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
To do as far as controls go because the controls

1228
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
You know scheme

1229
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Is pretty much the same thing that's on the

1230
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Playstation 3 and the Xbox 360

1231
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
And it works well you don't need to

1232
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Add some touch screens to it

1233
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Hell if you want to make the screen a touch screen or something

1234
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
That's fine you know so you can type and stuff

1235
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
It's a lot easier than you know the

1236
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Phone dialing type thing that they had

1237
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Going with it

1238
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
That would be fine if you just

1239
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Make the screen a touch screen for that kind of stuff

1240
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Because people dig that

1241
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
And if you want the control scheme you know for

1242
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Different like casual games

1243
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
That would be fine

1244
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
But I don't think they really need to reinvent

1245
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
You know the controls for the system

1246
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Itself it's pretty good

1247
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Alright

1248
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Well we'll see what happens I would imagine if there

1249
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Was going to be a new PSP probably not going to hear anything

1250
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
About it until next year's E3

1251
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
They're saying it's expected to launch

1252
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
At the end of 2011

1253
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Makes sense because you have the 3DS coming out

1254
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
At the beginning of 2011 so

1255
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
We'll see what happens maybe it'll do 3D

1256
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
On top of all that doubt it

1257
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
We'll see

1258
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
By the way before I get into my next story I did want to bring

1259
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
This up because somebody in chat had actually talked about

1260
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Let's see it was a little while ago here

1261
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
But talking about the gaming marathon

1262
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Or the marathon we were talking about doing over Labor Day weekend

1263
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Tiger Con or chat room says

1264
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Seems like a good idea for those of us in the west coast

1265
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Or for those in the west coast

1266
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
But for the east coast it would be enormously late for us

1267
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
I actually got

1268
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
A message right after that from

1269
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Bobby Blackwolf who does the show

1270
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Before us telling us he's actually going to be out

1271
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Labor Day weekend so that means

1272
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
There's going to be no programming on all games radio

1273
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
At all on Sunday because Dragon Con

1274
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Is that same weekend and PAX

1275
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
So we'd only be going up against PAX

1276
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
And Dragon Con

1277
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Just that?

1278
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
I think there's a lot of people

1279
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Listening to our show though that aren't able to afford

1280
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
To fly out to Seattle or Atlanta

1281
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
So I'm sure there'll be an audience

1282
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
For it if we want to do it

1283
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
So we'll see

1284
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
We'll have to see what happens

1285
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
I have to make sure it's okay that we can

1286
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Just hijack the stream for a whole day

1287
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
But I don't see why not

1288
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
I think more people would rather hear the talking

1289
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Than the music but maybe it's just me

1290
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Anyway we'll let you know next week

1291
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
As we move on talking about some more gaming news

1292
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
And GoldenEye is happening on

1293
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Of course the Wii coming out a little later

1294
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
This year

1295
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Except it's GoldenEye with Daniel Craig

1296
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Which is a little weird but you know it is

1297
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Somewhat of the same game

1298
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
That you should know of before

1299
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Well what's pretty cool is that when the game comes out

1300
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
They're going to be releasing a bundle that actually

1301
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Comes with a classic controller

1302
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
So if you want to spend

1303
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
$70 or $69.99

1304
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
To be exact

1305
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Oh that's right because they have the

1306
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
What's the difference? The classic controller

1307
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
It's got the little grippies on it

1308
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
There's a little bit extra stuff

1309
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
But also not just the fact that it's pro

1310
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
But it's gold, get it?

1311
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
GoldenEye, gold

1312
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Golden Wii, Wii is golden

1313
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Golden Wii

1314
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
So if you want to get a golden controller

1315
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Well there isn't actually a golden Wii

1316
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Just a golden classic controller pro

1317
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
For your white Wii or your black Wii

1318
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Does it tell you to drink more water?

1319
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Sorry

1320
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Don't lick it

1321
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Don't lick the golden Wii

1322
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
No release date

1323
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Announced outside the United States

1324
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
So if you're in another country you may not be getting this

1325
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
At all but you know what

1326
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Usually it's the other countries that get all those

1327
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Games, or not the games

1328
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
The different colors and things for their systems

1329
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Before we do so

1330
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
You can wait on this one

1331
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
I don't know it sounds cool I already have a classic controller

1332
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Might not be pro with grippy things

1333
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
I don't think I need a second one

1334
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Heck my Wii still isn't even hooked up

1335
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Although, shit

1336
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Metroid's out

1337
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Today?

1338
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
It's next week

1339
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
It's not next week, it's the week after next

1340
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Or wait, no it is next week

1341
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
It has to be next week

1342
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
The intro to that

1343
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
The little trailer that was up

1344
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Is gorgeous

1345
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
It looks awesome

1346
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
I'm going to have to dust off the Wii and hook it up again

1347
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
I think I really want to play that game

1348
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
So we'll see

1349
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
It's the first Wii game I've been interested in a very long time

1350
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
But I did play Goldeneye a little bit at E3

1351
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
And you know, it's Goldeneye

1352
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
But I think it's just cashing on

1353
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
The nostalgia

1354
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
I don't think there's going to be

1355
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
A whole lot else this brings to the table

1356
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Hey remember Goldeneye?

1357
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Hope that Oddjob isn't so much of a cheap bitch

1358
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
I actually played as Oddjob

1359
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
And he was an awesomely cheap bitch

1360
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Awesome

1361
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Dan and I watched this video

1362
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
That's like the top ten dick moves

1363
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
To pull in a game

1364
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
And one of them is playing Oddjob

1365
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
In deathmatch and Goldeneye

1366
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Okay now, I don't remember why

1367
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Why is he a cheap bitch?

1368
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Because he's short

1369
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
It's like when he's right up on you

1370
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
You can't shoot him

1371
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
You have to aim low to shoot

1372
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
But the hat toss thing is the best thing ever

1373
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
It really is

1374
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
There's a shoe, honestly

1375
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
When we were in Reno at the hotel

1376
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
I noticed

1377
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
That the direct to your room streaming

1378
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
For video games is N64 games

1379
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Which is just so backwards

1380
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
And weird to me, I don't know why

1381
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
It's been that way for years

1382
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
And now what kind of technology

1383
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Is that run on? Is that similar to like the

1384
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Streaming

1385
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
The PC games on live

1386
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Is that like on live in a hotel?

1387
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
How does that work?

1388
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
It's much lower tech than that

1389
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
It's literally, I think, running a cartridge

1390
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Wow

1391
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
So like too many people can't play it at once?

1392
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Since I'm on eBay right now

1393
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
They do sell those systems sometimes

1394
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
I don't remember what they're called

1395
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
But they're really expensive and they have

1396
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
A bunch of different

1397
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
N64 games in there

1398
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
That they can stream

1399
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Just while

1400
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Logie's looking at that, in our chatroom

1401
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
At chat.orangelandraday.com, some of the chatters

1402
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Are talking about Netflix on the Wii

1403
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
And a lot of folks using the Wii for Netflix

1404
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
I'm talking about the LodgeNet Nintendo 64

1405
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Yes, wow

1406
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
That the Wii

1407
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Is a good bedroom gaming console

1408
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
And that a lot of people can get Netflix

1409
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
In their bedroom with that

1410
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
You do need a disc for that

1411
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
There's no Netflix channel at this time

1412
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
But some folks are kind of talking about that

1413
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Looking at a comment from Odd1 in chat asking

1414
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Does Goldeneye have online play?

1415
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
I believe it does

1416
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
But no voice chat

1417
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
You just have to double opt in with your

1418
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
45 digit friend code

1419
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Kind of what you're used to in the games

1420
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
No voice chat, despite the fact we made this

1421
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Successory that we don't really use at all

1422
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Go Nintendo

1423
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Awesome

1424
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Alright, so

1425
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Going on Dark Sakura, what do you got for us?

1426
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Well you know what's better than a Nintendo 64

1427
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Lots of things actually

1428
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Peanut butter's better than a Nintendo 64

1429
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Hey

1430
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Mario Kart 64 was

1431
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Fucking awesome

1432
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Peanut butter is awesome

1433
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Dreamcast is pretty awesome

1434
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Guess what? They're still making games

1435
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
I had these coconut M&M's today that were delicious

1436
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
I had mocha M&M's

1437
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
They were actually better than a Dreamcast

1438
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
I have mocha M&M's and they're pretty damn good

1439
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
I mean you can't lick a Dreamcast

1440
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Well you could, but it wouldn't be very tasty

1441
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Avoid the warranty on that

1442
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Unless you're Jessica Chopra

1443
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Anyway

1444
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
They put out The Last Hope

1445
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
And Wind and Water Puzzle Battles

1446
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
And Rush Rush Rally Racing

1447
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
They're doing more

1448
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Dreamcast games, they want to do more

1449
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
And more, and they're actually trying to see if companies

1450
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Will release their games

1451
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
On the Dreamcast

1452
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
So they've got

1453
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Another release planned for next year

1454
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
But to supplement

1455
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
You know, any losses

1456
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
They've actually, you know, well

1457
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
To supplement their costs

1458
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
They'll be reproducing games for WiiWare

1459
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
And Xbox Live Arcade too

1460
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
I was going to say, they should talk to Sega since they're going to be doing

1461
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Those Dreamcast games on

1462
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Live already

1463
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Yeah, when?

1464
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Soon

1465
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
They did have Crazy Tax 83

1466
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
And the guy behind it, he totally wants

1467
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Sega to start producing for the

1468
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Dreamcast again

1469
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Which I kind of think isn't going to happen

1470
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
What could possibly make you think that?

1471
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Maybe because

1472
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
They've said themselves the Dreamcast is over

1473
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Yeah

1474
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Also, yeah, who's going to produce new Dreamcast

1475
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Hardware? How long is it before the

1476
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Patents are up on those things and then all the

1477
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Korean and Chinese knockoff

1478
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Systems can come out, like the Nintendos

1479
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
The Patents are up

1480
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
On the old school Nintendos and you see all these

1481
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
New Nintendos coming out

1482
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
That are, you know, they don't have the

1483
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Blow on the cartridge problem

1484
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Or any of that stuff, I mean it's all kind of different now

1485
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
I want the Famicom Disk System

1486
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Personally

1487
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
I think there's one out there that plays NES and Genesis games

1488
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
I want to say I saw

1489
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
I have something that will do that

1490
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
I have an NES and I have a Genesis

1491
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
They have a Genesis one

1492
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
And I have a PC

1493
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
The portable Genesis one

1494
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
I have a portable Genesis, it's called a Nomad

1495
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
I want to say it's about 20 years, because I have a feeling

1496
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
The Super Nintendo one is going to lapse really soon

1497
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
It already has, they have Super Nintendo

1498
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
systems out there

1499
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Do they really?

1500
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
You know, new

1501
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Duo LT's and I'll be happy

1502
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
But it would be interesting, I mean

1503
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Not to deviate too much from the topic at hand

1504
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
But you know, even if Sega didn't want to do the Dreamcast

1505
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Themselves, license

1506
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Before the patent lapses

1507
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
If they're just going to sit on it

1508
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Let someone else develop a Dreamcast

1509
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
I honestly think the Dreamcast games are still pretty solid

1510
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
You're cut out, for some reason

1511
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
I think the Dreamcast games are still pretty solid

1512
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
I mean, I've gone back

1513
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
And wanted to play stuff up

1514
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
I've been doing that today, I want to play Sonic Adventure

1515
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Because, well, you know

1516
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
I'm still kind of hot

1517
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
I'm holding the thing in

1518
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
I'm telling you, we're not hearing you

1519
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Well, I'm still wanting to play

1520
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Sonic Colors, when it comes out

1521
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
So I've been like, let's play Sonic Adventure

1522
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
So

1523
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Alright

1524
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Well, we'll see how

1525
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Successful this venture is

1526
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
It was also really easy to pirate Dreamcast games

1527
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
So we'll have to see how successful this venture is

1528
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
And hey, even if you couldn't

1529
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Get the game to burn right, you'd always get a great soundtrack

1530
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
True

1531
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
And they're those games that that company's putting out

1532
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
They are out there

1533
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
For piracy reasons

1534
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Why am I not surprised?

1535
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
I just run them on my cabinet at home

1536
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Because I have a Dreamcast emulator on there

1537
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
So, you know, fresh rush rally

1538
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Or whatever is pretty awesome, and I don't know where to buy that game

1539
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Not that I would anyway

1540
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Since it's like 40 bucks

1541
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
40 bucks for a Dreamcast game, nowadays

1542
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
No

1543
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Anyhow

1544
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
So it's kind of funny

1545
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Apparently, Microsoft got this great idea

1546
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Excellent idea, that they're going to

1547
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Digitally distribute

1548
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Review copies of

1549
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Halo Reach to the press

1550
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Or press people

1551
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Or whomever they have that they're distributing this to

1552
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
And it's available

1553
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
In a games on demand format

1554
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Through live

1555
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
In fact, some people found it actually

1556
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
On the

1557
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Marketplace for

1558
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
99,999

1559
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Microsoft points

1560
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Which is just, you know, it's just

1561
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
That's not showing up on the console, right?

1562
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
That's some website trick

1563
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Actually showing up on the website

1564
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
And, you know, obviously

1565
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Even if you did have the

1566
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
$1250

1567
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
To purchase the game, it would let you

1568
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Purchase the game

1569
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Unfortunately though

1570
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Even though it did

1571
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Come up on there

1572
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Someone found a way to download it

1573
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
And then people found a way

1574
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
To crack it

1575
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
And now it's leaked out there

1576
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Thanks to Microsoft

1577
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Which is ironic because this is probably

1578
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Why they did this in the first place

1579
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
They probably switched to digital distribution

1580
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
To avoid the piracy of the discs

1581
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
And what happened was this

1582
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Game site, I think

1583
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
GameTutorial.com

1584
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
They

1585
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Originally downloaded it

1586
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
And then they're like, haha, we have it

1587
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
We're not going to share it with anybody

1588
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
And somehow their copy leaked out to

1589
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Somebody else that was less scrupulous

1590
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Than they were and sent it out to the

1591
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Community and everybody figured out how to crack it

1592
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Like immediately

1593
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
That website got it legitimately?

1594
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
No, they found a way to hack the

1595
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Live server

1596
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
To download it without actually having to have the code

1597
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
And stuff

1598
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
They did that

1599
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
And

1600
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Yeah, so it's not

1601
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Too good for Microsoft

1602
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
And of course they're investigating

1603
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
How people were able to

1604
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Get this

1605
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Once it's on the internet, it's out there

1606
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
That's a really bad one to lose

1607
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
I'm surprised that

1608
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
They didn't test this

1609
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
On not so much of a triple A title

1610
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
They tested it on

1611
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
They did it with Crackdown 2 apparently

1612
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
It's on there like that

1613
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
But it didn't matter with Crackdown 2

1614
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Because that got leaked out a week or two before

1615
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
It was actually released

1616
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
This has been leaked out

1617
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
Three weeks before

1618
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
It comes out

1619
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
The format that they've broken down to now

1620
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Games on Demand packages

1621
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Are basically how you install

1622
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
A game onto your hard drive

1623
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
It's that format

1624
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Or if you download it from their service

1625
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
It's the same format but you're just downloading it

1626
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Consoles out there that are

1627
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Hacked with JTAG

1628
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Basically they can run

1629
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Pretty much anything

1630
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
There's a program out there to convert

1631
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
The games on demand packages to ISO

1632
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Or like a disk format

1633
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
And then you just dump all the files on there

1634
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
So that's what they basically did

1635
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
After they cracked

1636
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
The file that was on there

1637
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Monty Boggs in our chat

1638
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
says

1639
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Bungie will ban hammer

1640
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
That's actually kind of an interesting point

1641
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Because this is all being done digitally

1642
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
And these copies are signed

1643
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Isn't there a way that Microsoft could

1644
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Ban hammer all the consoles that have this?

1645
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Well, yes and no

1646
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Because yes they could ban them

1647
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
If they were dumb enough to take them online

1648
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
But these are being

1649
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
These copies that are out there right now

1650
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Are used on JTAG systems

1651
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Which are not used for online play

1652
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
JTAG systems would get banned anyways

1653
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
If you connected to Live after about four hours or so

1654
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
You would get your console banned

1655
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
So these systems are just meant for playing

1656
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
See what they're doing now

1657
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Is to play online

1658
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Is they're using tunneling services

1659
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
To use system like over the internet

1660
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
To play other people

1661
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
So that's how they're getting around it

1662
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
So they don't care that they can't connect to Live

1663
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Oh they use like a warp pipe style thing

1664
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Yes exactly

1665
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
So they're using tunneling services

1666
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
To basically play online

1667
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
And stuff like that

1668
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
And also they're not really missing out on anything

1669
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
If there's download content

1670
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Is this why we see less and less games supporting System Link?

1671
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:31,000
My mind goes to Starcraft 2 and the LAN thing

1672
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Well the LAN thing

1673
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
That's something different

1674
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
I think the reason why consoles don't use System Link nowadays

1675
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Is because the games are so sophisticated

1676
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
That they have trouble running them as a server

1677
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
And also running the game

1678
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
At the same time

1679
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
It's not easy for them to do it

1680
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
They have to program it

1681
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Efficiently enough to where they can do that

1682
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Like I wish Grant had thought it was System Link

1683
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Because

1684
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
We would still be playing our mod game

1685
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Because we wouldn't have to update anything

1686
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
So we could have been doing that

1687
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
But we had to play over Live

1688
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Red Dead Redemption was System Link

1689
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
And that's awesome because our internet connection at work sucks

1690
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
And so a lot of times we get disconnected from Live

1691
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
So System Link is definitely the way to go

1692
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
And also we used to play Saints Row 2

1693
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Which was a good backup game

1694
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
If our Live ever went down

1695
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
We would just play a System Link game of that

1696
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
And of course

1697
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Call of Duty and Halo

1698
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Is always supported System Link

1699
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Because of the LAN play and stuff like that

1700
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
So they're not going to just take it out

1701
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
Because of piracy

1702
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
But yeah it kind of sucks

1703
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
They tried to bypass it

1704
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
But unfortunately there's no way around it

1705
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
But the minute you try to take a

1706
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Hacked version of the game

1707
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Or a pirated version of the game online

1708
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
You're going to get banned

1709
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
If they play it on your

1710
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Say you have an account that you would use

1711
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
On a JTAG system and on a Live system

1712
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
If it shows that you're playing the game

1713
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Before the release like that

1714
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
They're going to probably ban you anyways

1715
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
Or at least flag you and watch what you do

1716
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
So obviously if you're going to play the game

1717
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
You don't play it on your account that you use on Live

1718
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
But

1719
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
I don't know

1720
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Alright

1721
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
But yeah it's tragic

1722
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
But that sort of thing happens

1723
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
What's also funny though

1724
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Actually kind of tying in with the hacking stuff

1725
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
There was a USB

1726
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
Mod chip

1727
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Announced actually for the Playstation 3

1728
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
That's going to be released next week

1729
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
And apparently

1730
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
This chip kind of works like

1731
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
I guess

1732
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
A tool that they have for

1733
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Actual Playstation repair

1734
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
And stuff like that it puts the system into a developers mode

1735
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Where you can run on signed code

1736
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
And apparently

1737
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
This chip or whatever

1738
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
The USB card

1739
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Can be updated

1740
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
You can update the firmware on it

1741
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
So they can never really be locked out from the system

1742
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
And also it's going to be able

1743
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
You're going to be able to dump games to your hard drive

1744
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
And run them straight off your hard drive

1745
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
Like you could with the Playstation 2 HD loader

1746
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
And stuff like that

1747
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
That's something that will be interesting

1748
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
It's called the PS Jailbreak

1749
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
Even though I don't really think it's a jailbreak

1750
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
But that will be coming out

1751
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
Next week which will be interesting

1752
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
Now what about I saw this story on some websites

1753
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
And the story said

1754
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Well we don't know what's going on

1755
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Because they're just showing this running on a debug system

1756
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
Which is

1757
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
They're showing a feature that isn't new for a debug system

1758
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Well that was that one video

1759
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
That was from

1760
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
I don't remember if it was osmodchips.com

1761
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Or something like that

1762
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
It's one of the stores that's selling them

1763
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Online they were showing it running on their debug system

1764
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
But the thing is

1765
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
The company or whomever that made these chips

1766
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
Send it out to a bunch of different sites

1767
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
To review and test out

1768
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
And stuff like that

1769
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
And there were other people that do not have

1770
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Debug systems that were running it and doing the same thing

1771
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Can't Sony patch this out

1772
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
In minutes?

1773
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
No because it's the same tool that they use to fix

1774
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Their consoles so

1775
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
They can't really patch it out because it would fuck up

1776
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
I think developer consoles or something like that

1777
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
Or if they did

1778
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Basically what they would have to do

1779
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Is ban a certain

1780
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
USB ID or something like that

1781
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
So that it would detect

1782
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
Okay this is this card

1783
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
So we're going to make it so that

1784
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
You can't run this anymore

1785
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
But all they can do is they update the firmware

1786
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
On that card and they can change that ID

1787
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Or whatever

1788
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
So I don't

1789
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
They say that there's no way to ban it

1790
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
And I'd be willing to bet though that

1791
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
I mean they may patch it

1792
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
And they may fix it again

1793
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
With the PSP or the DS or the Wii

1794
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Or anything

1795
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
They put out patches to fix things

1796
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
And fix loopholes

1797
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
But it may be too hard

1798
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
And on the other thing too

1799
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
What this is supposed to do is

1800
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
It will also disable forced updates

1801
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Forced system updates

1802
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
So for example

1803
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Newer software that comes out has the newer system versions

1804
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
And stuff like that

1805
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
And you can actually disable it from updating your system

1806
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
So if you're playing offline

1807
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
I don't know

1808
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
It would be interesting to watch

1809
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
Because now the one console system

1810
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
That was the most secure

1811
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
Has now been cracked wide open

1812
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
It would be interesting to see

1813
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Vidpower in our chatroom says

1814
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
What is with the term jailbreaking

1815
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
Being used for everything that involves hacking?

1816
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
You know the iPhones use that term too

1817
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
I don't know

1818
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
It's a clever term

1819
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
And it caught on

1820
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
It's a buzzword

1821
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
It's trendy

1822
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
It kind of makes sense for the iPhone

1823
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
But it's trendy so everyone wants to use it now

1824
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
I'm thinking about jailbreaking my phone

1825
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Just so I can downgrade the stupid OS

1826
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
I hate iOS 4 on a 3G

1827
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
Supposedly there's a patch coming

1828
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
But we've been waiting what

1829
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
Two months?

1830
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Actually I just updated the patch

1831
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
On my 3GS

1832
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
And I've noticed it running a little bit better

1833
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
3GS's are different though

1834
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
I know but I'm saying

1835
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
It could have included some fixes

1836
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
I'm not going to hold my breath

1837
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
But I will get excited about this

1838
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
I'm very excited about this announcement

1839
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Well of sorts

1840
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
It's about the game Torchlight

1841
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
Which is a little kind of PC

1842
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
I don't know if you want to say indie game

1843
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
It's by Runic Games which is made up

1844
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
Of a lot of people who were with Blizzard

1845
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
At one time or what have you

1846
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
But it's a cool game one way or the other

1847
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
If you like Diablo 2 this is a great kind of holdover

1848
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
While you wait for Diablo 3

1849
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Torchlight

1850
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
Originally they wanted to put Torchlight on Xbox Live Arcade

1851
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
But they actually

1852
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
I guess kind of held off for whatever reason

1853
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Didn't end up doing it

1854
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
But now they're apparently putting serious effort

1855
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
Into actually making a console version of Torchlight

1856
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
And it was announced at Gamescom

1857
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
By the Runic CEO Max Schaeffer

1858
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
Quote, we're trying

1859
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
We're talking to Sony and Microsoft

1860
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
And we hope to get that done quickly

1861
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
And they want to have it available by the holidays

1862
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Just so you know this game

1863
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Has actually already moved about 750,000 units

1864
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
So it's already almost sold close to a million

1865
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
Which isn't bad for a game like this

1866
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
That's been mostly digital distribution

1867
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
I know I got it on one of those crazy

1868
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
Steam sales

1869
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
And I'm sure a lot of you guys did

1870
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
As well

1871
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
Get it that way

1872
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Piracy apparently has been an issue with this game

1873
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
Unfortunately

1874
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
So they can't track how many illegal copies are going on out there

1875
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
But seeing as Torchlight 2

1876
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
Is going to be multiplayer

1877
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Especially if this does go to Xbox Live and so forth

1878
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
They'll have that to think about

1879
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
They'll be able to track that a little better

1880
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
There's also a Torchlight MMO

1881
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
Happening at some point

1882
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
So we'll see

1883
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
It'll be interesting though if Torchlight goes to Xbox Live

1884
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
And PSN because it's only single player

1885
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
One of its biggest drawbacks is there isn't really multiplayer in it

1886
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
That's why they're doing Torchlight 2

1887
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
And a lot of the games on

1888
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Xbox Live Arcade and Playstation Network

1889
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
Really thrive on a multiplayer environment

1890
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
Not all of them, like what, Mega Man 9

1891
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
Is it really multiplayer?

1892
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
There's other stuff out there that doesn't

1893
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
Have to be multiplayer

1894
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
But uh

1895
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
It'll be very cool to have a Diablo style game

1896
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
On Xbox Live I think

1897
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
I don't know, what do you think? You're a fan of Torchlight, right Alan?

1898
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
What do you think of this game moving to the

1899
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
Consoles?

1900
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
Whatever will help it get a larger audience

1901
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
So that when, if the MMO

1902
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
When it does come out

1903
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
It'll succeed, then I'm all for it

1904
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
Alright

1905
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
Let's move on to some more gaming news

1906
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
Then we'll get to some release dates, StarkSakra

1907
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
Well

1908
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
You know how some places

1909
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Have these archaic laws on the books

1910
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
Like, in Alabama it's illegal

1911
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
To walk around with an ice cream cone in your back pocket

1912
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Did you know that?

1913
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
Now I wanna go and just do it

1914
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
I don't know if you can walk around with an ice cream cone in your back pocket

1915
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
With a crunch

1916
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
It's possible, but it gets soggy

1917
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
Well, the city of Beacon, New York

1918
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Has one that says

1919
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
That there can't be pinball

1920
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
Tables, they're illegal there

1921
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
And now they're enforcing it

1922
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
They've shut down

1923
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
A retro arcade

1924
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
You cut out for a minute

1925
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
They shut down a retro arcade

1926
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Didn't pinball

1927
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
Used to be associated with gambling

1928
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
In the mafia and things like that

1929
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
Years and years ago, so maybe that's where the law came from

1930
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
And, you know, them darn kids

1931
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Um, the mayor of Beacon

1932
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
You might have to switch mics

1933
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
The mayor of Beacon said it was

1934
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
Is this better?

1935
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
Yes

1936
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
Okay, they said it was about noise

1937
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
That people complained about the noise

1938
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
And blah blah blah blah blah

1939
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
And so they said

1940
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
Well, we'll just use this law

1941
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
As a convenient excuse to enforce

1942
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
The noise thing

1943
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
Which is bull

1944
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
I mean, seriously?

1945
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
I know, I would actually like to see

1946
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
What other businesses are around the people

1947
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
That supposedly complained

1948
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
So

1949
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
You know, I think it was on CNN

1950
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
Or one of the news channels

1951
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
They were actually showing this place

1952
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
And it actually looked kind of cool

1953
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
And I'm thinking, like, I've never heard of this town

1954
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
Until this happened, but

1955
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
There was this place there that I thought

1956
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
I might want to visit someday

1957
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
But now I guess I can't

1958
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
It's kind of a bummer

1959
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
Because this place is somewhat unique

1960
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
And I bet they would have had visitors

1961
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
I don't know how far it is from New York City

1962
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
But I bet there would have been folks in that

1963
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
New York area that might take a trip out

1964
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
To upstate someday to go take a look at it

1965
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
But obviously they can't now

1966
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
They're shooting themselves in the foot

1967
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
And the guy's saying

1968
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
We tried to help them save their business

1969
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
And find them other locations

1970
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
And use decibel tests to be objective

1971
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
And blah blah blah

1972
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
It's just crap

1973
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
The loudest thing that happens

1974
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
When I play pinball is when

1975
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
I miss and I go, God damn it

1976
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
And I'm just yelling

1977
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
At the table

1978
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
Do you think maybe that's what happened there?

1979
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
Was just an outbreak of people saying, God damn it, shit

1980
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
You know, if they had good carpeting

1981
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
It would have totally muted the noise

1982
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
There used to be

1983
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
There was a little tiny arcade

1984
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
Out in Roseville called Supercade

1985
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Years and years ago, run by this old gentleman

1986
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
That sadly he got put out of business

1987
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
He was in the middle of a strip mall

1988
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
He had tons of pinball games and arcade games

1989
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
And he never

1990
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
Got noise complaints

1991
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
Or what have you

1992
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
There's people that own retro arcade tables

1993
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
And have them out in the Galleria

1994
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
In a hallway

1995
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
So in the Danos

1996
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
Interesting

1997
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
Alright, well let's start to travel the world

1998
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
And take a look at some release dates

1999
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
And hopefully these games will not be banned

2000
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
In your local city

2001
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Yes, not a whole lot

2002
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
Coming out this week

2003
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
But there's some pretty good stuff

2004
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
Let's just start with the stuff

2005
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
Not necessarily the good stuff

2006
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Martian Panic

2007
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
From Zoo Games

2008
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
It's a generic arcade shooter game

2009
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
Available with a neon green

2010
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
Shotgun, or by itself

2011
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
Those of course on the Wii

2012
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
Nancy Drew, Secrets Can Kill 2010

2013
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
Coming out on PC

2014
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
Umm...

2015
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000

2016
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000

Stardock

2018
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
Oh god, I forgot this was coming out

2019
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
Because

2020
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Someone thought it was a great idea to put

2021
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
Grease the musical

2022
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
Or like the sing-along version of it

2023
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
I guess, in theaters

2024
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
There's Grease the video game

2025
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
Coming out on Wii and DS

2026
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
Where you can sing and dance with the

2027
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
Casts of Grease

2028
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
In opportunity form

2029
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
Fun

2030
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
This is pretty cool

2031
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000

2032
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
And L.A. Machine Guns

2033
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
A game I seriously played tons of

2034
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
Back in the Qsar days

2035
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
Coming to the Wii as well

2036
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
For a wonderful $30 retail price

2037
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
Just like that House of the Dead 2 and 3 collection

2038
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
It should be pretty fun

2039
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
Gotta go back and play Ghost Squad some more

2040
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
That's some fun stuff

2041
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
Umm...

2042
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
Dead Edition will also be coming out this week as well

2043
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000

And PC this week

2047
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
Umm...

2048
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
That game from 2K

2049
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Harvest Moon Grand Bazaar on DS this week

2050
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
Here's a game for Rob

2051
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
Hello Kitty Online

2052
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
Coming out on PC this week

2053
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
Yay! Wait, I thought this had been out for a while

2054
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
Well, apparently it's the disc version

2055
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
Of the game

2056
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
It's just digital before you

2057
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
NHL 2K11 on the Wii

2058
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
Coming out this week

2059
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
Ivy the Kiwi

2060
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
On DS and Wii this week

2061
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
The Bachelor

2062
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
The video game

2063
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
Okay, wait, you've said that game like three times

2064
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
It's been delayed a ton of times, okay

2065
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
I wonder why

2066
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Because it's a terrible, terrible game

2067
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
I think they just want you to keep announcing it every week

2068
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
So they keep delaying it one week at a time

2069
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
You know that they are putting out an amazing race game

2070
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
When I was in Reno, I played an amazing race slot machine

2071
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
That was actually really cool

2072
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
It was like a high budget thing

2073
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
It had a huge subwoofer in it

2074
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
It had Phil

2075
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
That's all you need

2076
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
It was a nice slot machine

2077
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
And the one at Calneva

2078
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
I won a ton of money on

2079
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
Well, not a ton, for pennies I won a ton of money

2080
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
But the one at Eldorado ripped me off

2081
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
So just a word to the wise

2082
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
That go to Reno to do their gaming

2083
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
Go play at Calneva because their slots are looser

2084
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
Yeah, The Bachelor video game

2085
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
Eventually is going to come out at some point

2086
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
Then making way for probably more crappier games

2087
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
Oh, actually I know it's making way for more crappier games

2088
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Like Survivor and Minute to Win It

2089
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
And

2090
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
Pretty much any game show that's on TV now

2091
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
Is going to have a game based on it

2092
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
And it's going to be on the Wii

2093
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
Because that's what they do

2094
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
Battlefield Bad Company 2

2095
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
The Ultimate Edition

2096
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
A re-release with a bunch of download content

2097
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
And fun download content for

2098
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
Battlefield 1943

2099
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
As well

2100
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
Or 1942, I don't remember which game it is

2101
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
Anyways, that's on

2102
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360

2103
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
Ghost Pirate of Vuju Island

2104
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
On PC, some value game there

2105
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
From Disney

2106
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
Guilty Party

2107
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
Kind of like a clue type of game

2108
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
That's on the Wii

2109
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Yeah, we talked about that a little while ago

2110
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
This time it's actually coming out

2111
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
Camp Rock the Final Jam on DS

2112
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
A new movie

2113
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
Ace Combat Joint Assault on PSP

2114
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Valkria Chronicles 2

2115
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
On PSP as well

2116
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:25,000
Game called Cosmo's Chaos on the DS

2117
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
Of course, the big one this week

2118
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
Metroid Other M, coming out on the Wii

2119
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
And

2120
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
And I believe that's it

2121
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
Oh, no, there's a couple other crappier games here

2122
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
At the very end

2123
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
Valkria on the DS, my first dollhouse on the DS

2124
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
And Prison Tycoon in Alcatraz on PC

2125
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
Prison Tycoon in Alcatraz, wow

2126
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
Chat.orangewonnagevideo.com

2127
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
More comments from the chat room

2128
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
Brakeman in our chat says

2129
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Yay, amazing race! Wait, what's the amazing race?

2130
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
It's a TV show

2131
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Here

2132
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
I thought they had it in other countries, maybe not

2133
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
But it's like teams of two that go around the world

2134
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
And it literally is a race

2135
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
They pick up clues

2136
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
It's like, I don't want to say a scavenger hunt

2137
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
What's the other kind of game?

2138
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
Isn't there a game that people

2139
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
can play where you go from point A to point B

2140
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
and pick up clues along the way? I don't know what the name for that is

2141
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
But that's the reason why it is

2142
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
You do tasks at every

2143
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
point in every city and you move on and the winner gets a million bucks

2144
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
It's a show

2145
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
And let's see

2146
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
Chat.orangewonnagevideo.com more comments

2147
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
Where's the mole game? asks Frisbee

2148
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
Excellent question

2149
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
That was the best reality show they ever did

2150
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
Monty Boggs says, how come Big Brother Wii

2151
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
doesn't sound appealing to me?

2152
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
Because you're not trashy

2153
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
They still may do that

2154
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
If the Survivor game sells, why not?

2155
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
They had, was it

2156
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
America's Top...

2157
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
Do they have America's Top Model?

2158
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
They had America's Top Model

2159
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
What other

2160
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
crappy games did they have?

2161
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
Wipeout

2162
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
They had a thing for that

2163
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
I get Minute to Win it because they're just going to do

2164
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
Wii versions of all those stupid games

2165
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
they play on that show

2166
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
Let's go to Target, the game

2167
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
and buy paper cups and ping pong balls

2168
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
and pay somebody a million dollars

2169
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
to do the tricks

2170
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
I'm surprised they don't have a home game yet

2171
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
I believe it's coming out

2172
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
if it's not already out

2173
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
It's not hard to do

2174
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
a home version of Minute to Win it

2175
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
Go to the dollar store

2176
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
Exactly, dollar store the game

2177
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
SSG100Matt says

2178
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
Robin Allen should be on The Amazing Race

2179
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
I'm a Robin Jamie

2180
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
Actually, I don't know how Allen feels about being on Network TV

2181
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
like The Amazing Race, but I gotta say, me and my friend Victoria

2182
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
have been talking about it for at least two years

2183
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
how badly we need to go on The Amazing Race

2184
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
I don't drive, and there's usually

2185
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
you know, you have to get into

2186
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
a jeep and one person does something

2187
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
while the other person drives

2188
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
and I couldn't do that

2189
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
My favorite task I ever saw on The Amazing Race

2190
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
was when they were in Thailand

2191
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
and they had to get in these taxis

2192
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
but they're karaoke taxis

2193
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
Thai karaoke songs from point A to point B

2194
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
or whatever, but they were actually

2195
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
singing with women

2196
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
in the back seat, but they were actually female

2197
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
impersonators, and some of the teams

2198
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
didn't even catch on to it

2199
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
that they were singing with

2200
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
Taiwan Asian female impersonators

2201
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
Was there like a bro team

2202
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
asking for their number?

2203
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
You know there was, they showed it on TV

2204
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
but the challenge cracked me up

2205
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
I do free Xenocord

2206
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
they do need a supermarket sweep game

2207
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
I thought there was one

2208
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
a while ago, a supermarket sweep game

2209
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
like on PC or something

2210
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
I love that game

2211
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
watching that on, what was it, Lifetime?

2212
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
Also, Press Your Luck

2213
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
there is a Press Your Luck game on Wii

2214
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
and I think there's another one coming out this year too

2215
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
Yeah, there's Press Your Luck, A Price is Right

2216
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
There's a new Wheel of Fortune game

2217
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
New Jeopardy

2218
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
A lot of those game shows

2219
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
are actually out

2220
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
I don't know how good they are

2221
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
I seem to remember

2222
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
X-Link called into the show some time ago

2223
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
and he's told me about it since then

2224
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
that the Press Your Luck game is surprisingly not bad

2225
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
I mean, you get what you pay for

2226
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
Right? I mean, if you buy a

2227
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
Press Your Luck game, you know exactly what game

2228
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
you're buying

2229
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
It's not a big surprise

2230
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
Is it responsive?

2231
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
Do the questions repeat after

2232
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
playing it three times?

2233
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
That's all you really need, right?

2234
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
You know what you're buying when you buy the Press Your Luck home game

2235
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
Alright, let's get to the Japanese release dates

2236
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
Enough about game shows. I could talk all day about game shows

2237
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
I love game shows

2238
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
In fact, I would love to see

2239
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
the Sherri Shepherd version of the Newlywed game

2240
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
because you know she's going to make a great house

2241
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
Comment about the American X-Top Model game

2242
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
Didn't sell well because no matter

2243
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
what you did, Tyra got a better score

2244
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
than you and then she yelled at you

2245
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
So that didn't sell well

2246
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
So here's a question though

2247
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
What would happen if you had Tyra play

2248
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
the America's Top Model game?

2249
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
Now would it go into an infinite loop like

2250
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
the Tic Tac Show game in WarGames?

2251
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
If she still had her show

2252
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
she would have used this opportunity to see

2253
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
Now me, and here's my game

2254
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
I had so much fun recording this

2255
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
I had so much fun doing my game

2256
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
The Tyra show really was the Tyra show

2257
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
It was about Tyra

2258
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
She could be doing a whole show on anorexia

2259
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
and bulimia and one time she'd be like

2260
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
I remember this one time when I was at a restaurant

2261
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
and I didn't want to eat what was in front of me

2262
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
and I found that to be so hard

2263
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
I cried that I had the salad

2264
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
and it was very devastating to me emotionally

2265
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
Let's go to Japanese release dates

2266
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
Kane & Lynch 2 Dog Days

2267
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
comes out on the 26th on the

2268
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
Xbox 360 hip hip hooray

2269
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
That is a Japanese release

2270
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
so I don't know if they fully localized it

2271
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
or what but that is coming out

2272
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
They're actually played by dogs now

2273
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
Now that I'd buy

2274
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
That would make the Kane & Lynch series like

2275
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
ten times better

2276
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
if it was a gritty crime drama

2277
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
with canines, dogs

2278
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
Hold down R2 to scoot your butt

2279
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
Alright, on the PlayStation 3

2280
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
Kane & Lynch 2 Dog Days

2281
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
is also coming out over there

2282
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
No word if you can press R3 to poop

2283
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
Agarest Zenkei Zero

2284
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
compile heart selection

2285
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
comes out as well

2286
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
I'm imagining it's some type of compilation

2287
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
It's the record of the Agarest Wars

2288
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
or at least maybe a sequel to it

2289
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
the one where you can breed

2290
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
It is a prelude to Agarest Zenki

2291
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
so it is actually a prequel

2292
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
You have to breed to create the new game

2293
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
That has something in common

2294
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
with a dog game then

2295
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
Let's see, moving to

2296
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
Man, and ten dogs

2297
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
would be so much cooler if they gave

2298
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
the dogs guns

2299
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
Don't you think?

2300
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
They have a game like that

2301
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
This got brought up

2302
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
at my work the other day too

2303
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
It would be even cooler if dogs had guns

2304
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
on their back

2305
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
Yeah, but they've done that

2306
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
It's Metal Max

2307
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
or something?

2308
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
Sega was what came out over here

2309
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
They have dogs

2310
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
with artillery cannons on their back

2311
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
Ridiculous stuff

2312
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
It's awesome

2313
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
Coming out on the Wii in Japan

2314
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
I talked about this last week

2315
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
It's coming out on the 26th

2316
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
Twinkle Queen comes out on

2317
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
the Nintendo Wii

2318
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
What kind of game do you think Twinkle Queen is, Alan?

2319
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
I don't know, but I'm still waiting for my royalty check

2320
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
I think it's Twinkle Star Sprites

2321
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
It is

2322
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
Here's the description

2323
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
So is Carmen Sandiego coming back?

2324
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
I don't think it's those types of PC games

2325
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
I don't think of Laidback and

2326
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
Tea Drinker as the same

2327
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
I think of tight-assed

2328
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
and ramrod straight

2329
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
back Tea Drinker

2330
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
being proper

2331
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
Character themes and other background music will be imported from the

2332
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
originals and rearranged for Twinkle Queen

2333
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
A maximum of four players

2334
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
can play the game at a time

2335
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
So I love it, it's PC games

2336
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
but it's coming out on the Wii

2337
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
I'm looking at the screenshots and I don't see Carmen Sandiego

2338
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
but I do see a lot of

2339
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
scantily clad women

2340
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
from Katamari Damacy

2341
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
She's there

2342
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
I think it would be laid back if your tea was laced with something

2343
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
Isn't that the Queen from Katamari Damacy?

2344
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
Yes it is

2345
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
Is this a Romco Bandai game?

2346
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
No, it's from Milestone

2347
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
Maybe they licensed it or something

2348
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
I swear that looks like the Queen from Katamari Damacy

2349
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
No, she's wearing a kimono

2350
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
So is it a fighting game?

2351
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
It's probably something behind her head

2352
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
Interesting

2353
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
Oh well

2354
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
Chicks beating each other up

2355
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
We haven't seen that before

2356
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
Actually we have

2357
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
Nah, it's a joke

2358
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
We've seen it tons of times

2359
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
That's why I'm joking

2360
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
Alright, anyhow, moving on to the handhelds

2361
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
There's nothing on PlayStation 2

2362
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
just so you know

2363
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
On the Sony PSP

2364
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
Ace Combat

2365
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
Joint Assault

2366
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
Hakioki Zusoruku

2367
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
Portable comes out this week

2368
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
from Idea Factory

2369
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
I don't know what this game is

2370
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
This is an adventure game

2371
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
that

2372
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
I don't know

2373
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
This chick's cuddling with her blanket

2374
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
in one of the cutscenes

2375
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
Looks very dating sim

2376
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
This looks like a girl dating sim game

2377
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
Aren't these all boys trying to be her suitor?

2378
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
Maybe that's what it is

2379
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
Suitor, sperm donor

2380
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
We got the bachelor here

2381
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
We got that there

2382
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
Monhoniki

2383
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
Poka Poka Ailoumura

2384
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
That's what she's hoping for

2385
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
That's coming out from Capcom

2386
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
I'm trying to see what game

2387
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
it is, if it's something we would know here

2388
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
You guys recognize this game?

2389
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
They look like the characters from Animal Crossing

2390
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
Don't they?

2391
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
This is like a PSP version of Animal Crossing

2392
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
No it's not

2393
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
It's the little

2394
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
I think ascii cat people

2395
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
They kind of look like Doraemon

2396
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
A little bit

2397
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
They have ears

2398
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
Interesting

2399
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
Quickly on the DS

2400
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
Sorry I'm taking a long time here

2401
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
On the Nintendo DS

2402
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
Nothing really notable

2403
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
that comes out this week

2404
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
Unfortunately

2405
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
So there you go

2406
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
Those are your Japanese release dates

2407
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
Let's go to jolly old England

2408
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
and talk about their releases

2409
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
On the 24th we have Grease for Wii and DS

2410
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
On the 24th we also have Gunblade New York

2411
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
and L.A. Machine Guns Arcade

2412
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
I'm a big fan of Gunblade New York

2413
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
for the record

2414
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
We also have Ivy the Kiwi

2415
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
It's got a question mark at the end

2416
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
So it's Ivy the Kiwi

2417
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
It's coming out here

2418
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
You have cut out yet again

2419
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
Live radio folks

2420
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
We have Ivy the Kiwi

2421
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
Kiwi

2422
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
Shank

2423
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
Game vs. the World

2424
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
and Shank again on Xbox 360

2425
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
On the 27th we have Mafia 2

2426
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
for PC, PS3, and 360

2427
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
Alright

2428
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
That's it

2429
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
A few more news stories for you guys

2430
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
in the classic game of the week

2431
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
Sony has been ordered to pay 5 million yen

2432
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
to a former Sony employee

2433
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
who is named

2434
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
Looks like

2435
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
Hiro Kume

2436
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
and he invented

2437
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
I guess a small optical pickup

2438
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
that was used to read and write discs

2439
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
in the Playstation 2 and the original Playstation

2440
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
Of course he felt that

2441
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
Sony didn't recognize his contributions

2442
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
and he took them to court

2443
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
and he won

2444
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
So that's not bad

2445
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
and it roughly translates to

2446
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
about $60,000

2447
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
is what he won

2448
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
and he says

2449
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
I thank the court for identifying

2450
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
some of my contributions to the company

2451
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
but the company should have appreciated

2452
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
my contributions when I was an employee

2453
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
Ouch

2454
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
Scathing a little bit

2455
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
Speaking of lawsuits

2456
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
This guy

2457
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
Craig Smallwood apparently is his name

2458
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
sued the makers of Lineage

2459
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
He wants

2460
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
basically them to fess up to the fact

2461
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
that their game is too damn addicting

2462
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
in so many words

2463
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
that Lineage 2 specifically is so addicting

2464
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
that he is quote

2465
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
unable to function independently in usual daily activities

2466
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
such as getting up, getting undressed,

2467
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
bathing or communicating with family and friends

2468
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
Apparently he played the game

2469
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
for 20,000 hours

2470
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
between 2004 and 2009

2471
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
That's like literally

2472
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
half of every single day

2473
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
playing Lineage 2

2474
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
Hmm

2475
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
Apparently it's negligence

2476
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
and gross negligence there

2477
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
I think Bobby was talking about this story on his show too

2478
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
and he found through some other resources I guess

2479
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
that the guy was actually running a gold farming service

2480
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
in this game

2481
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
because you'll notice

2482
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
he played for 20,000 hours between 2004 and 2009

2483
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
Doesn't really point out why he stopped

2484
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
So is he really addicted to the game

2485
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
or is he just a jilted gold farmer?

2486
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
I don't know

2487
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
It seems like a combination of

2488
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
I don't know, OCD

2489
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
that could be a legitimate situation that he was in

2490
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
but also he had

2491
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
I guess from when we were listening to

2492
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
Bobby Blackwolf's show

2493
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
he had three accounts that he was using to gold farm

2494
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
Maybe he realized that his return on investment

2495
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
was so much better the more

2496
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
hours he logged into each of his three accounts

2497
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
and that's what got him

2498
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
addicted

2499
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
I have to play 12 hours a day

2500
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
because then I'll make $100 this week

2501
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
and uh

2502
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
that could be it

2503
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
Well let's just assume that wasn't

2504
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
even all a factor

2505
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
and that's off the table for a minute here

2506
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
We're just talking about somebody suing

2507
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
the makers of the game they've become addicted to

2508
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
because their game is too addicting

2509
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
I mean, really? Does that mean I can sue

2510
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
McDonald's because I'm addicted to Chicken McNuggets

2511
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
and they made me fat?

2512
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
They've tried, people have tried

2513
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
Really? What a country

2514
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
I know, it's ridiculous

2515
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
The whole thing is coming down to lack of self control

2516
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
You know, I love Star Trek Online

2517
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
You know how much I love the damn game

2518
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
Guess who doesn't stay logged into it

2519
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
for more than two hours at a time

2520
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,000
That would be me

2521
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
Even if my friends in the UK are on

2522
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
I log off

2523
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
As much as I love talking to them

2524
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
You know, when I was playing

2525
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
Ragnarok

2526
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
Maybe I would leave it on to vend

2527
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
But I would walk away from my computer

2528
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
You know

2529
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
It's addiction

2530
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
Well not really addiction

2531
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
There's no

2532
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
Now the only thing that I could remotely say

2533
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
of physical effect is

2534
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
This is getting into a little bit

2535
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
of chemical psychology

2536
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
Is what stimulates the pleasure centers of the brain

2537
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
And that does become addicting

2538
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
You know, for example

2539
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
Love has the same effect

2540
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
in the brain that cocaine can

2541
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
You know

2542
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
And that's the only way

2543
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
I can see any kind of addiction

2544
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
possibly forming

2545
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
But that's where the self control

2546
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
comes in

2547
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
It may be hard

2548
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
But you have to take some time for yourself

2549
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
Get away from the game

2550
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,000
I don't know what Lineage 2 has in place

2551
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
It's not a game I've played

2552
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
I played it at E3 a few years ago

2553
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
And have a can of coke in my vault

2554
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
Oh

2555
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
Was that the game that gave away the soda?

2556
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
This was years ago

2557
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
I think I remember it now

2558
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
It wasn't a bad game

2559
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
It's way more popular

2560
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
in Asia than it is here

2561
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
Way more popular

2562
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
Wow is the US game

2563
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
Lineage and Lineage 2 are twice that

2564
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
what it is here

2565
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
I recognize the

2566
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
art style on this can

2567
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
The character creation

2568
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
Lineage is a huge game over there

2569
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
I believe this gentleman lives in Hawaii

2570
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
So Hawaii gets

2571
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
a little bit of a blending of both cultures

2572
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
a lot of times

2573
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
Lineage probably has a pretty good fan base

2574
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
Certainly has its players

2575
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
here in the continental US too

2576
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
I don't know

2577
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
It's just a lot of other

2578
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
games I've played

2579
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
Like WoW

2580
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
I joke that I'm addicted to WoW

2581
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
But at the end of the day, for instance

2582
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,000
Alan and I went to Reno this weekend

2583
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
And we walked away

2584
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
Believe it or not, we're okay

2585
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
We're gonna run our daily the minute we get home

2586
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
But we're okay

2587
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
There have been times in WoW where it's like

2588
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
maybe midnight, 1am

2589
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
Daily, rep, whatever, BS

2590
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
And I'm not tired yet

2591
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
But I'm just on my mount

2592
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
doing laps around Dalaran

2593
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
And I'm not really playing

2594
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
I'm like, what am I doing right now?

2595
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
I'm in WoW

2596
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
I have nothing to do

2597
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
I should just log off

2598
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
And I've had moments where I just have to make myself sign off

2599
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
And you're not even chatting?

2600
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
Because I've done that, but it's because I'm chatting with people

2601
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
Like I'll be running laps in Dalaran, but I'm also chatting

2602
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
Well I'll be reading Trade or whatever

2603
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:31,000
There's nothing morally redeeming about Trade Chat

2604
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
Yeah, it's like 4chan, but in WoW

2605
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
Pretty much

2606
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,000
But WoW, when you log in

2607
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
Well, I don't remember if WoW has it when you log in

2608
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
But at least I know some of the tip screens say

2609
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
Some of the loading screens will say

2610
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
Remember to take everything in moderation

2611
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
Including Warcraft

2612
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
Final Fantasy XI had a disclaimer

2613
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
You had to click every time

2614
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
Don't forget your friends, family, or work

2615
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
You know, this whole little spiel

2616
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
Every two or three hours?

2617
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
No, every time you logged into the game you had to click it

2618
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
Yeah, I remember that

2619
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
But I mean

2620
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
It really does come back

2621
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
You know, and this

2622
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
I can be on AIM and get caught up in a conversation with somebody

2623
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
That's one thing

2624
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
You know, I could be

2625
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
Online reading news articles

2626
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
And get caught up in reading

2627
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
Or I do it with Wikipedia all the damn time

2628
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
But the whole thing is

2629
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
To catch yourself

2630
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000
To make reminders

2631
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
When you notice the time

2632
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
Then

2633
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
Oh crap, I've gone on too long

2634
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
You know, I'll have to check this later

2635
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
I don't really think

2636
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000
I think that maybe going like

2637
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
An hour or two over

2638
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
When you decided that you wanted to stop

2639
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
That's kind of understandable

2640
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
Getting caught up is human nature

2641
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
But to make a habit of it

2642
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
And to

2643
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
Play to the exclusion of all else

2644
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
That's when it gets unhealthy

2645
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
Well, again

2646
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
I don't know if he's going to be very

2647
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
Successful suing the makers of the game

2648
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
Because he couldn't control himself

2649
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
I just think it would set a horrific precedence

2650
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
You know, we could sue anything

2651
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
That had a negative effect on us

2652
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
I mean, it's just

2653
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
You have to have some self control

2654
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
It's just kind of sad that the judge wouldn't throw it out

2655
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
But nope, the judge actually

2656
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
Is allowing the case to proceed

2657
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
That should be interesting

2658
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
You know why I would think it would be a good idea

2659
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
To let a case like that proceed?

2660
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
So he's struck down

2661
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
Setting legal precedence

2662
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
I can see that

2663
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
Let's see, XenaCorner in our chatroom at chat.orangelandraday.com

2664
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
Says Lineage 2 is an unreal engine converted

2665
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
Grinding piece of shit

2666
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
Or POS, I'm assuming meaning piece of shit

2667
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
Tigerclaw says

2668
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
You know, Starcraft 2 can be quite addicting

2669
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
The other night I was playing it late at night

2670
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
And by the time I stopped it was like 5am in the morning

2671
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
Yeah, well a lot of video games

2672
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
I mean, Starcraft I've heard of tons of addictions

2673
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
Addictions of varying degrees

2674
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
Stories of that

2675
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
But I'm sure there's lots of video games

2676
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
Even Jamie has talked about

2677
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
When you were in high school or college

2678
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
You stayed out for a week to play

2679
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
And granted, I did have the flu

2680
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
Legitimately

2681
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
But all I did was play Final Fantasy

2682
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
It was Final Fantasy 3

2683
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
6 over in Japan

2684
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
That's the only game I've ever

2685
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
You know, played

2686
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
While I was that sick

2687
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
You know, when I had my surgery

2688
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
I played tons of Blue Dragon last time

2689
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
I didn't play any games this time because my hand

2690
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
Heard a different way

2691
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
But I played a ton of Blue Dragon last time

2692
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
You know

2693
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
Big deal

2694
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
I wouldn't

2695
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
I played a lot of Final Fantasy 7 when I was supposed to be in college

2696
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
I'd skip class from time to time

2697
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
To watch Sailor Moon or play Toushinden

2698
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
I mean

2699
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
And when my friend

2700
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
Had his

2701
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
He had a Saturn before everybody else because he imported it

2702
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,000
And I stayed up all night playing

2703
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
The damn Gundam game

2704
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
And King of Fighters

2705
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
But that's one time

2706
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
You know

2707
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
Alright

2708
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
Well speaking of addicting games

2709
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
I think it's time for us to take a trip down memory lane

2710
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
And look at some of the games of the past

2711
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
And that's in a segment we call

2712
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
The Classic Game of the Week

2713
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
Dark Sakura is picked as an addicting game

2714
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
But it's certainly one she thinks

2715
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
Kicks ass

2716
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
It's the Classic Game of the Week

2717
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
Dark Sakura, what should the kids be worshipping this week?

2718
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
The game is called Wrecka

2719
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
And this game was made

2720
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
For the Summer Carnival in 1992

2721
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
It's a very limited

2722
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
Printing of it

2723
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
But it's amazing for an S game

2724
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:45,000
This isn't some music

2725
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
You see it's got a pretty rad soundtrack

2726
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
For an S game

2727
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
All I hear are the bullets

2728
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
I've got the soundtrack to this

2729
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
But now the game itself

2730
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,000
Is probably one of the

2731
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
I would say earlier

2732
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
Games that could be considered

2733
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
Bullet hell

2734
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
Really I think it could be

2735
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
I mean you see who in the chat room got

2736
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
Freaking excited with one of our

2737
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
Bullet hell fans

2738
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
But

2739
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
Wrecka is

2740
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
Pretty damn hardcore

2741
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
I mean we've got ROMs of it

2742
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
You can actually buy

2743
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
Let me get this site again

2744
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
I think it was

2745
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
Wreckaness

2746
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
You can buy reproduction

2747
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
Cartridges

2748
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
To play on US systems

2749
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
Which is pretty cool

2750
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
But the game

2751
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
What makes it really special is that

2752
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
It is

2753
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
One of the

2754
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
Highest

2755
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
Sprite counts

2756
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
In a game at a fast pace

2757
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
And you can see

2758
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
While it's playing on there

2759
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
It's not really so much of a flicker

2760
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
It's playing pretty smoothly

2761
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
On the actual system

2762
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,000
I'm seeing some flicker but it seems like they do some tricks

2763
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,000
With the way the bullets fly out and things

2764
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,000
I don't know if that's just the frame rate

2765
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,000
In a conversion to YouTube or what

2766
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
But it seems like they do some

2767
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
It looks really amazing the frame rate

2768
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
For a NES game

2769
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
On the YouTube it's blazing fast

2770
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
I'm really impressed by this

2771
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
It really does play that fast

2772
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
The game itself

2773
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,000
Was published by

2774
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
Naxastsoft

2775
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,000
N-A-X-A-T

2776
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,000
In 1992 like I said for the summer

2777
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
Carnival

2778
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
It is a side scroller

2779
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
It has

2780
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,000
Bottom to top

2781
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
Scrolling

2782
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
You get all kinds

2783
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
Of power ups

2784
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
Modifiable power ups

2785
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,000
The ones you wait for them to change

2786
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,000
Or you can shoot them and they'll change

2787
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
This particular stage that we're watching

2788
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
This is just the second level

2789
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
You go up through this tube

2790
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
And then you go backwards down the tube

2791
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
That's kind of rad I like that

2792
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
Yeah

2793
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
And the soundtrack for it

2794
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
Is freaking amazing

2795
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
The other

2796
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
Things that you have with this too

2797
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
Is that instead of having bombs

2798
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
That when you stop shooting

2799
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
You can build up a power surge

2800
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
And deflect

2801
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
Incoming fire

2802
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
And then if you charge it long time

2803
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
It'll clear the screen

2804
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
The way a bomb would do

2805
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
Um

2806
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
It's really hard to do that though

2807
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
Because as you can see how fast the enemies come at you

2808
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
And look at the effects in the background

2809
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
I mean that's very

2810
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
Looks almost mode 7-ish

2811
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
I should say

2812
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
And this was before there was such a thing as mode 7

2813
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
It has a normal

2814
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,000
Score attack and time attack

2815
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,000
It's single player only

2816
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
Um

2817
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,000
The game is cool

2818
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
You've got five primary weapons

2819
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
And then five optional weapons

2820
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
Um so you get different power ups

2821
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
And you can shoot different ways

2822
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:01,000
It's just really really amazing

2823
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,000
But this isn't one of the typical story

2824
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000
Oh you have to fight off the aliens

2825
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,000
Blah blah save the earth

2826
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,000
And

2827
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,000
I think that Wrecka is just a freaking cool name

2828
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,000
For uh

2829
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
For a game that needs blazing fire

2830
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,000
But the official name is

2831
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,000
World Consumer Series Summer Carnival

2832
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
92 Wrecka

2833
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,000
And good luck freaking finding it

2834
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,000
I just even love that idea of flying

2835
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,000
Up the tunnel and then flying back down

2836
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
Like you just don't see that in a lot of shooters

2837
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
At least that I can think of

2838
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
Usually in fact shooters are almost always

2839
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,000
Ship is on the bottom and you're moving

2840
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,000
Your way up

2841
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,000
Or you rarely ever see it the other way

2842
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
Rarely ever see it the other way

2843
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
Around where you're flying at the top of the screen

2844
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
Moving down

2845
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,000
You know the only other game that I've seen some kind of innovation

2846
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,000
For the standard side scrolling shooter

2847
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,000
Was that same Gundam game that was on the Saturn

2848
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,000
Back in the day when it came out

2849
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
Because you had um three planes

2850
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,000
You were in the middle ground

2851
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,000
But you had foreground and background

2852
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,000
Enemies to fight too

2853
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,000
And now this here is stationary

2854
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,000
Not just that as a non-standard shooter

2855
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
But I always think of of course this game

2856
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,000
We never talk enough about it here on Orange Knows Radio

2857
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,000
One of the most underrated NES games they ever made

2858
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,000
Was half shooter and a decent shooter at that

2859
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
And then half Zelda-ish game

2860
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,000
In fact if we do end up doing our little labor day marathon

2861
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,000
I think we should just play the shit out of that game

2862
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,000
And beat it

2863
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:25,000
Dude I'm all for it

2864
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,000
But yeah see that right there

2865
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,000
Is the example of the charging move

2866
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
That's a pretty sweet game for an NES game

2867
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,000
It's just it's super rare

2868
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,000
And that's why

2869
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,000
Those reproduction cartridges are out

2870
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,000
I'm actually considering

2871
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:43,000
Getting one

2872
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,000
It's supposed to be um

2873
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,000
Let me see how much they're selling it for

2874
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:49,000
On the website

2875
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,000
I believe that if you pay

2876
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
$58

2877
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,000
That's on check or money order

2878
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,000
Standard delivery you get

2879
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
The gray cartridge

2880
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,000
A reproduction box and a manual

2881
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,000
It's done in our chatroom as saying that

2882
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
Legend consumer series only applies to the soundtrack

2883
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:11,000
It's just Summer Carnival 92 Wrecka

2884
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
Well the soundtrack

2885
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,000
Cut out

2886
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,000
What?

2887
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,000
The soundtrack is worth having

2888
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,000
I found it actually to download somewhere

2889
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000
So

2890
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,000
Speaking of the soundtrack go get it

2891
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,000
The music is really sweet

2892
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
Alright there it is your classic game of the week

2893
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,000
Wrecka

2894
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,000
Or if you want Summer Carnival 92 Wrecka

2895
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,000
For the Nintendo Entertainment System

2896
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,000
Good luck finding that although it does sound like you get

2897
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,000
The reproduced cartridges

2898
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,000
If nothing else

2899
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,000
Somebody get me one

2900
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,000
That's gonna do it for part A here at Orange Lounge Radio

2901
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,000
But we're not done yet we got more news coming up in part B

2902
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,000
We're gonna talk a little bit about Rock Band 3

2903
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,000
Talk a little bit about Dance Central

2904
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,000
Lots of music game news

2905
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,000
We're gonna talk about a new drawing tablet on the Wii

2906
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
Talk of course a little bit about Doctor Who

2907
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
And more hacking news

2908
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
And also ways to cut the lines

2909
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,000
At PAX

2910
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
We'll be interested to see what the chatters think about this story

2911
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,000
We're gonna be getting to this

2912

Orange Lounge Radio

2916
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio

2917
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,000
We are live on this Sunday evening

2918
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
August the 22nd of 2010

2919
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
Where we are taping live

2920
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,000
The 378th episode of our show

2921
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,000
Yeah

2922
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
It's been about 8 and a half years

2923
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,000
So there you go

2924
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,000
Lots of news coming at you here in part B

2925
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,000
We're gonna get into that in a minute

2926
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,000
Your twitter topics here just a few minutes away

2927
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
Thought we could talk a little more about Reno

2928
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
And some of the fun experiences we had up there

2929
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
There's actually some interesting arcades up there

2930
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
Did anything in the arcades catch your eye?

2931
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
While you were up there?

2932
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,000
We were in the big one at Circus Circus

2933
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,000
That was mostly just you know ticket

2934
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,000
Ticket spitters you know gambling for kids

2935
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
I did see a smaller arcade

2936
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,000
That I never got a chance to actually go into

2937
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
That had a lot of Capcom stuff

2938
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,000
Like they had MVC 2

2939
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,000
Yeah remember when we were looking in there

2940
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
You were like no that's my kind of arcade

2941
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
Yeah well it's like my butt you know

2942
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
I've got 10 bucks is it gonna last longer on slots

2943
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:15,000
Or on arcade games

2944
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
So arcade games 1

2945
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,000
Ray Ayanami says we should have gone to Atlantis

2946
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
What do they have there

2947
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000
Oh they probably have really

2948
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,000
The problem with a lot of those huge huge ones

2949
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000
They're not downtown

2950
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,000
The downtown ones are much easier

2951
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,000
Because they're all kind of in the same city block

2952
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,000
You don't have to get in the car and go whatever

2953
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
Anything else interesting in Reno that you came across?

2954
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,000
The fact that it's kind of

2955
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000
I don't want

2956
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,000
How can I say this without sounding pretentious

2957
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,000
Just Reno is

2958
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:45,000
Kind of low budget

2959
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,000
I mean that's kind of the point

2960
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,000
If you can afford to go to Vegas

2961
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,000
You just go to Vegas

2962
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,000
So Reno is really kind of watered down

2963
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
We had a hilariously awful

2964
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
Dining experience there

2965
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
Which I thought was funny considering it's

2966
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
Amazing sort of you know

2967
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,000
The El Dorado, Silver Legacy, Circus Circus

2968
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,000
It's all one big mall they're all connected

2969
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,000
You can just stay in that facility

2970
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,000
So it was after Rocky

2971
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,000
And it was around 1130 we were all starving

2972
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
And exhausted

2973
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
So we sat down

2974
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,000
Not even kidding

2975
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,000
30 minutes for her to take our order

2976
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
Another 35 for our food to arrive

2977
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
So we were at the table for about an hour

2978
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
And the food showed up and I had joked

2979
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,000
That when we got our receipt

2980
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
For the tip section we should write

2981
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
In the margin

2982
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,000
We put your tip in that slot machine

2983
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,000
And you should go get it

2984
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
Very nice

2985
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,000
I've taken something from my

2986
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,000
Best friend

2987
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,000
She leaves two cents

2988
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,000
Yeah I've done that before

2989
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,000
I once was in I think it was in Olive Garden

2990
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
Which is why I don't like going there

2991
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
Where the friend and I that I was with

2992
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,000
It was like 7 cents

2993
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,000
It was a very specific amount of change

2994
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,000
To where they knew it was deliberate

2995
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
Well you know it was hard though in that case

2996
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,000
I really don't like doing that

2997
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,000
Unless it really is clearly

2998
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
This weight person's fault

2999
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
But last night I don't know

3000
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
I kind of got the feeling like the place was just badly managed

3001
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,000
Like I felt like the weight person was working

3002
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
I mean she was trying her best

3003
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,000
So I didn't want to be a dick

3004
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,000
But you know it was really bad

3005
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000
The food was good but yours was cold

3006
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,000
We all had hot food but yours was cold

3007
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:23,000
So that was lame

3008
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,000
Very lame

3009
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
We're going to do this real quick

3010
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,000
I'm getting a lot of complaints in chat that we're skipping really bad

3011
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,000
And I don't know why that would be happening

3012
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,000
So I just want to remind everybody in studio

3013
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:35,000
Take a minute to make sure you don't have anything running in the background

3014
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,000
That could be doing bandwidth

3015
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,000
What I'm going to do, I'm going to do a quick

3016
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,000
Disconnect and reconnect

3017
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,000
So for live listeners you might get dumped

3018
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,000
Just reconnect real quick

3019
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,000
But I'm going to see if that helps fix the problem here

3020
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
I'm going to do a quick disconnect and reconnect

3021
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,000
And see what happens here

3022
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,000
And we're going to keep things rolling for the podcast

3023
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
So just bear with us

3024
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,000
This is what happens when you tape a show live

3025
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,000
So we're going to disconnect right now

3026
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,000
And so

3027
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,000
Haha the live listeners can't hear us right now

3028
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,000
Are there any live listeners you want to talk smack about while we're doing this?

3029
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,000
Smack smack smack smack

3030
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,000
Alright let's reconnect

3031
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,000
Alright so we're reconnected so we'll see

3032
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,000
If that hopefully helps the problem

3033
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:15,000
I don't know but everything otherwise

3034
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:17,000
Looks good on our end

3035
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,000
So it could be on the all games end as well

3036
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,000
I don't know

3037
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,000
So we'll see

3038
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,000
Anyhow let's move on to some rapid fire news

3039
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
And all the quick little things that

3040
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,000
You know if we had a five hour show we could talk more about

3041
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,000
Loki

3042
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
Why don't you start us off

3043
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,000
Let's see so

3044
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,000
There's some interesting stuff here

3045
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
We'll start with

3046
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000
Of course

3047
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
Something from Dragon Quest 9

3048
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
And there was something you mentioned

3049
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
Robin I don't think it was Dragon Quest

3050
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,000
It was um

3051
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,000
Oh I remember now

3052
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,000
It was 3D Dot Game Heroes

3053
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,000
There was like uh

3054
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,000
Foo Foo or something like that

3055
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,000
It was insinuated like you know sex or something

3056
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,000
Yes that is um

3057
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,000
It's one of the towns you go in and yeah

3058
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,000
You can buy Foo Foo from somebody

3059
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,000
For like ten dollars and it makes you

3060
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,000
It's very very uh

3061
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,000
Well anyways

3062
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000
Apparently Dragon Quest

3063
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,000
Um

3064
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
I guess this is uh

3065
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,000
Yeah Dragon Quest 9

3066
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
There's something you can um

3067
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,000
Purchase I guess

3068
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,000
It's Poof Poof

3069
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,000
Or Puff Puff

3070
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,000
I guess Puff Puff Performance

3071
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,000
Is a quest you can unlock

3072
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
And um

3073
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
Apparently Puff Puff is

3074
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
Interesting because

3075
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
Obviously this is an

3076
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
E10 game there is

3077
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,000
No sex involved

3078
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,000
But uh Puff Puff I guess is coming

3079
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,000
I read this

3080
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,000
It's uh

3081
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
It comes from the Japanese word

3082
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
I guess uh

3083
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
Pafu Pafu

3084
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
Which I guess is supposed to represent the sound

3085
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
Of rubbing

3086
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,000
One's breasts and another person's face

3087
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
And that's kind of like what happens

3088
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,000
In this thing

3089
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,000
This French woman

3090
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,000
With large breasts

3091
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,000
Um convinces the player to sit down

3092
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,000
In a chair and she blindfolds him

3093
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000
And then she proceeds to

3094
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,000
Perform Puff Puff on him

3095
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,000
Of course funny enough

3096
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
It's not really her breasts rubbing against his face

3097
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,000
But it's two slimes against his face

3098
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,000
But still

3099
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,000
Kind of scandalous

3100
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,000
A little bit

3101
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:31,000
Is that really the sound that makes Pafu Pafu?

3102
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,000
Is that what they said?

3103
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,000
I don't know. Jamie could you come over here

3104
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,000
For a minute?

3105
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
Sure

3106
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,000
We have an experiment we need to try

3107
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
Okay we're gonna put the microphone right there

3108
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,000
It didn't sound very Pafu Pafu

3109
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:49,000
Like

3110
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,000
Boobs what do you have to say?

3111
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
They don't say anything

3112
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,000
They just sit there and look pretty

3113
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,000
Apparently

3114
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
Apparently it's in the game and it's funny

3115
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,000
They had a funny video of it as well

3116
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:03,000
Online and it's very um

3117
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
Filled with

3118
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
Induendo

3119
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
Yeah but E10

3120
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,000
It'd be different if it was a mature raid game

3121
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
Um

3122
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
Red Faction Battlegrounds

3123
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,000
Has been announced for Xbox Live Arcade

3124
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,000
And the Playstation Network

3125
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,000
By THQ Digital

3126
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,000
Is gonna be a prequel to

3127
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,000
Red Faction Armageddon

3128
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,000
And if

3129
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,000
I should say if THQ has it their way

3130
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000
They want to put the game out for free

3131
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
Or close to free as possible

3132
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,000
Perhaps as a preorder

3133
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,000
Like

3134
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:39,000
Incentive for ordering

3135
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
Red Faction Armageddon

3136
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
So that sounds kind of cool

3137
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
Um

3138
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,000
And is expected to come out sometime

3139
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,000
In 2011 probably

3140
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
3 or 4 months before the game is released

3141
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,000
Or Red Faction Armageddon is released

3142
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
Um

3143
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
So that's interesting

3144
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
And then finally

3145
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:01,000
If you're a fan of music games

3146
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,000
And who isn't

3147
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,000
There is a brand new browser based music game

3148
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
You can check out called

3149
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,000
Instant Jam

3150
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,000
It comes from Instant Action

3151
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
And it's a game that looks very similar

3152
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,000
To say like a Guitar Hero

3153
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,000
Um

3154
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
You know one of those games where you have

3155
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,000
It sounds like a very instant kind of company

3156
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,000
Yeah like the no highway and you know the

3157
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:25,000
Different things coming down

3158
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:27,000
Apparently it supports your own music library

3159
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,000
Um and it also supports

3160
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,000
Keyboard or USB guitar

3161
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,000
Controllers and allows for

3162
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
In game music purchases as well through

3163
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
Amazon or iTunes

3164
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:39,000
Um I guess it's a version of download content

3165
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,000
And uh

3166
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,000
There is a beta currently available through Facebook

3167
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:47,000
And versions um

3168
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:49,000
I guess playable through the website

3169
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,000
And embedded elsewhere

3170
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
Will be rolled out soon

3171
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,000
Alright

3172
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,000
Well let's move on with some other

3173
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,000
Stories here and I want to talk about

3174
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
Speaking of music games, Dance Central

3175
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,000
Has some new songs announced for it

3176
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,000
Ten more songs announced this week

3177
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:07,000
Nelly Furtado with Man Eater

3178
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,000
Basement Jax with

3179
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
Rendezvous

3180
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,000
Benny Benassi with Satisfaction

3181
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,000
Nina Sky with Move Ya Body

3182
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,000
Cascada with Evacuate the Dance Floor

3183
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:19,000
Pitbull with I Know You Want Me

3184
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
Calle Ocho

3185
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,000
I know you want me

3186
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,000
I know I want ya

3187
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:27,000
Sounds like Strong Bad singing

3188
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:29,000
Fanny Pack with

3189
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,000
Too bad it's not the

3190
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,000
Fanny Pack song, Camel Toe

3191
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,000
But it's Hey Mammy

3192
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,000
Mammy? M-A-M-Y

3193
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,000
Mammy? Mammy is

3194
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
M-O-M-M-Y

3195
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,000
Depends on if it's a name

3196
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,000
Or another language

3197
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,000
Roriana has Pond to Replay

3198
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,000
Cool and the Gang

3199
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:51,000
Jungle Boogie

3200
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:53,000
Technotronic with Pump Up the Jam

3201
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
And Kylie Minogue

3202
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,000
with Can't Get You Out of My Head

3203
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,000
That was a fun song when it was in DDR

3204
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,000
like years and years ago

3205
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,000
I was going to say there were some

3206
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,000
other songs as well

3207
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:07,000
I can confirm that are going to be in the game

3208
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,000
In fact I'm looking

3209
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,000
Oh is it the whole lyric spill thing that happened?

3210
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:13,000
No, no, not even

3211
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000
More scandalous than that

3212
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,000
This is

3213
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,000
This is Wonderful People

3214
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,000
Shouldn't be in places that they are

3215
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,000
Are they naughty people that have already gotten copies

3216
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,000
of the game somehow? They're naughty people that have

3217
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,000
gotten copies of the beta that's on

3218
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:29,000
Partner Net right now

3219
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,000
Of course they can't play anything because

3220
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,000
it requires a Kinect camera but

3221
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:35,000
doesn't mean that they won't know

3222
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:37,000
what songs are on there

3223
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,000
and included in there

3224
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,000
I'm not sure if these have been already announced

3225
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
Lady Gaga's Poker Face

3226
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,000
Lips Ink, Mouth to Mouth

3227
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,000
M-I-A, Arlor

3228
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
No Doubt, Rock Steady

3229
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000
Bell Biv Devoe, Poison

3230
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,000
and BC Boy's Body Moving, the Fat Boy Slim remix

3231
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:55,000
A few of those were already out there

3232
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
but I don't remember the M-I-A song being announced

3233
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,000
that's news to me

3234
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:01,000
Interesting

3235
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,000
Alright

3236
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,000
Well we'll see if

3237
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:07,000
what the song list looks like anyway

3238
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:09,000
I'm sure not too much longer

3239
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:11,000
we'll have the full song list announced

3240
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,000
I'll probably give you about ten songs a week till it's all out there

3241
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:15,000
Anyhow, how about Toy Story 3

3242
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:17,000
Yeah it's not just a movie

3243
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,000
it's a game as well

3244
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
The game is out there, it's on the Wii I'm sure

3245
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,000
It's also on the Xbox 360 and the Playstation 3

3246
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,000
In fact the Playstation 3

3247
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:27,000
is taking the opportunity of

3248
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,000
having this unique hybrid premium

3249
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:31,000
edition

3250
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:33,000
So there is actually a new version out there

3251
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000
of Toy Story 3 bundled with

3252
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:37,000
the original Toy Story movie

3253
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:39,000
on a single Blu-ray disc

3254
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,000
for 6499

3255
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:43,000
So it's interesting

3256
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,000
that it's not just like a combo

3257
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,000
pack, but it's actually

3258
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,000
both things were put onto one

3259
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,000
disc for 65 bucks

3260
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,000
Interesting

3261
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,000
Yeah

3262
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:57,000
But sadly

3263
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,000
it's not both Toy Story and Toy Story 2

3264
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,000
otherwise that would be a really killer deal

3265
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,000
but what about Toy Story 2?

3266
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,000
What about that?

3267
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,000
What about it?

3268
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,000
Dartatouille is correcting me saying it was Love at First Sight

3269
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,000
that was in Max 2 US

3270
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:13,000
Can't Get You Out of My Head, I was really close

3271
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:15,000
That was in one of the US ones

3272
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:17,000
I thought Can't Get You Out of My Head wasn't one of the US ones

3273
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:19,000
Oh well, whatever

3274
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,000
Anyhow, how about something non-music

3275
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:23,000
game related, how about an MMO

3276
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,000
but this is not the type of MMO you'd think

3277
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,000
It is related to Disney though

3278
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,000
Disney Pixar has a game called World

3279
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,000
of Cars online

3280
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,000
and of course you know in the Disney MMOs

3281
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,000
you may have heard of this, you can't type in

3282
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,000
your own stuff, you have to use the pre-selected

3283
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,000
phrases and things that have been selected

3284
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,000
for you, well one of the other things

3285
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,000
you can do in the game is that you can pick your own car number

3286
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,000
because of course you're playing race cars

3287
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,000
so you can have whatever car number you want

3288
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,000
except for 69

3289
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
you cannot be car

3290
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,000
69 in the car's MMO

3291
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
Can you be car 420?

3292
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,000
No, because the cars only have two digits

3293
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,000
but you could be car 54 and you could be like

3294
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,000
where are you?

3295
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,000
old joke

3296
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,000
I liked that show, it had the dude that played

3297
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:07,000
Herman Munster

3298
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:09,000
There you go, so yeah when you're selecting

3299
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,000
apparently when you're in the game selecting the number for your car

3300
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,000
if you go like, you select each

3301
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,000
digit one at a time, so if you select

3302
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:17,000
4, 5, 7, then you see

3303
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
1 through 9 is the next digit, but when you

3304
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:21,000
select 6, it only goes 0 through 8

3305
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,000
so, interesting

3306
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:25,000
World of Cars

3307
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:27,000
online is free, worldofcars.go.com

3308
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:29,000
you can sign up for free

3309
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
but it is a

3310
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,000
$5.95 a month subscription

3311
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,000
if you want to get all the features

3312
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,000
of World of Cars

3313
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:39,000
that will not unlock car number 69

3314
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,000
no just so you know, not even if you

3315
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:43,000
pay for it

3316
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,000
Dark Sakura

3317
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,000
Well how about some

3318
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
something different, something in the

3319
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,000
Squeenix direction, remember we talked about

3320
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,000
Gun Loco?

3321
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:55,000
Well it turns out it's a game about

3322
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:57,000
a planet full of criminals

3323
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:59,000
they're all crazy

3324
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:01,000
crazy crazy crazy criminals with guns

3325
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:03,000
and the world's sort of like

3326
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:05,000
an earthish ruin

3327
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,000
type place and there's different

3328
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:09,000
factions and they're always fighting

3329
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,000
so

3330
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,000
it looks

3331
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:15,000
completely hilarious

3332
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,000
I think I would really really

3333
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,000
like to play it

3334
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:21,000
all the characters were done by

3335
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:23,000
Kenny Wong and basically made

3336
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:25,000
toys of everything and then they scanned

3337
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:27,000
them into the game so that's how the design

3338
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:29,000
come about, so that's pretty cool

3339
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,000
and then

3340
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,000
for Rock Band we have the Disturbed

3341
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:35,000
Pack

3342
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:37,000
that's going to be on August

3343
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:39,000
24th a couple days

3344
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:41,000
from now, the Disturbed Pack has another

3345
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,000
way to die, Asylum and the Animal

3346
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:45,000
and then

3347
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:47,000
there's Universal Motown Republic

3348
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:49,000
Rock Pack which is Crash King's

3349
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:51,000
Mountain Man, the Vir Union

3350
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:53,000
Seasons and We Are the Fallen Bury

3351
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:55,000
Me Alive

3352
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:57,000
also

3353
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,000
only one of those is available in

3354
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,000
Lego Rock Band and that is the Vir Union

3355
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:03,000
Seasons and lastly

3356
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,000
the big Horkan grocery

3357
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:07,000
store chain in England

3358
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:09,000
called Tesco, you've

3359
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,000
heard of them I'm sure

3360
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:13,000
No, because they don't have them here

3361
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:15,000
Actually, they do

3362
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,000
There's a company called Fresh and Easy

3363
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,000
that's a

3364
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:21,000
Tesco chain in the United States

3365
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:23,000
Still, I don't think I've ever

3366
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,000
been to one, but okay

3367
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:27,000
Let's just be opening a couple

3368
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:29,000
in Sacramento

3369
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:31,000
but anyway

3370
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:33,000
it's like a big grocery store chain

3371
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:35,000
anyway, they are now

3372
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:37,000
going to be buying

3373
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:39,000
used games

3374
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:41,000
you will be paid in credit and then you

3375
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:43,000
can buy whatever you need in the grocery store

3376
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:45,000
so

3377
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:47,000
basically they're saying

3378
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:49,000
for Red Dead Redemption you'll get

3379
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:51,000
a £19 trade in

3380
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:53,000
Mario Kart for Wii gets £19

3381
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:55,000
FIFA 2010 gets

3382
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:57,000
£12, that type of thing

3383
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:59,000
and then they're going to resell the

3384
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:01,000
stores at other outlets

3385
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:03,000
and already

3386
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:05,000
about 60 Tesco stores

3387
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:07,000
accept them

3388
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:09,000
Everybody wants a piece of that industry

3389
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:11,000
Now when someone says they have to pick

3390
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:13,000
between video games and food, if money's

3391
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:15,000
certain, they can literally

3392
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:17,000
I had to give up

3393
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:19,000
Red Dead Redemption, but I got some

3394
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:21,000
Top Ramen, awesome

3395
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,000
Alright, let's get into some Twitter

3396
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,000
topics tonight. Every week you guys

3397
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:27,000
submit us topics at www.

3398
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:29,000
twitter.com slash o-l-r

3399
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:31,000
and we pick a few of our

3400
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:33,000
favorite topics and read through them here on the show

3401
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:35,000
and sadly

3402
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:37,000
I seem to be without my music tonight

3403
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:39,000
What did I do?

3404
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:41,000
I broke it all

3405
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:43,000
Well, I guess Twitter topics cancelled because I don't have

3406
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:45,000
theme songs. I blame Rob, I blame Rob

3407
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:47,000
Live Radio

3408
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:49,000
You just want to

3409
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:51,000
sing the theme song tonight?

3410
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:53,000
Oh, thank god we're all

3411
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:55,000
saved, alright

3412
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:57,000
Twitter.com slash o-l-r

3413
01:57:57,000 --> 01:58:03,000
Let's see who tweeted us this week here

3414
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:07,000
Redtertainment sends us a tweet

3415
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:09,000
says, o-l-r, is there a video game

3416
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:11,000
equivalent of Rocky Horror?

3417
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:13,000
You mean a game so bad

3418
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:15,000
that it's kind of good?

3419
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:17,000
Actually, I'll say this, there really was

3420
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:19,000
There was a Rocky Horror show game

3421
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:21,000
There was one of them back in the 80's

3422
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:23,000
on the Apple 2e and the Commodore 64

3423
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:25,000
I believe had a version

3424
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:27,000
and you actually went around the castle

3425
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:29,000
getting parts of Frank N Furter's laser

3426
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:31,000
or something like that, you could play as Brad or Janet

3427
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:33,000
I remember, and then they made a CD

3428
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:35,000
That sounds rather Maniac Mansion

3429
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:37,000
It was kind of inspired by that

3430
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:39,000
There was a CD-ROM based one in the

3431
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:41,000
mid 90's for one of the big

3432
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:43,000
UK revivals and it actually

3433
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:45,000
had like, back when full motion video was in

3434
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:47,000
every CD-ROM game, they actually had a

3435
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:49,000
Rocky Horror show game there, but it was released

3436
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:51,000
I think exclusively in the UK, so I never played it

3437
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:53,000
I don't know if people out there did

3438
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:55,000
but that would be it

3439
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:57,000
What about a game so bad it's kind of good?

3440
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:59,000
How about not taking the question so literally

3441
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:01,000
and a game so bad

3442
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:03,000
it's kind of good?

3443
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:05,000
Like, I think about Loki and how he talks about

3444
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,000
Driver 3 all the time, that it's so terrible

3445
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:09,000
that it's actually kind of fun

3446
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:11,000
Earth Defense Force 2017

3447
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:13,000
It's a very terrible game

3448
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:15,000
but it's very fun

3449
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:17,000
I think back in the day for me it was

3450
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:19,000
Abadox

3451
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:21,000
I don't know if I can think of one

3452
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:23,000
that I really go, gosh that game

3453
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:25,000
is so bad that I just love it for some reason

3454
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:27,000
Anything come to your mind now?

3455
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:29,000
Think of?

3456
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:31,000
I'm not sure if I'm thinking of

3457
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:33,000
terrible or just really difficult

3458
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:35,000
but Battletoads?

3459
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:37,000
I thought of one

3460
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:39,000
I thought of one, a game that we actually played

3461
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:41,000
on end because it was so awful

3462
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:43,000
What's that?

3463
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:45,000
Batman 3

3464
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:47,000
It had the butt monkey in it

3465
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:49,000
Seriously, it had this

3466
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:51,000
like a baboon, so it had the big exposed

3467
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:53,000
butt, and it would fly

3468
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:55,000
its butt at people

3469
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:57,000
and then there was this one guy who his

3470
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:59,000
taunt was shooting people

3471
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:01,000
He could just take damage off by

3472
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:03,000
taunting, just shoot

3473
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:05,000
bang, and it was so bad

3474
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:07,000
and the voice acting was so horrible

3475
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:09,000
and even to this day when

3476
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:11,000
I'm hanging out with Mystique and we see a monkey

3477
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:13,000
we'll go butt monkey dance

3478
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:15,000
butt monkey dance

3479
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:17,000
because he danced when he won

3480
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:19,000
Tigerclaw

3481
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:21,000
leave it to him to have the Google Foos

3482
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:23,000
skills to find more information

3483
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:25,000
The Rocky Interactive Horror

3484
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:27,000
Show game was released in March

3485
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:29,000
April 1999

3486
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:31,000
it was later than I thought

3487
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:33,000
for the PC by Online PLC

3488
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:35,000
Similarly to the earlier CRL game

3489
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:37,000
the player plays as Brad or Janet

3490
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:39,000
and must rescue their partner from the castle

3491
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:41,000
unlike the older computer game

3492
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:43,000
its gameplay was more puzzle oriented

3493
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:45,000
and benefited from the added detail, graphics

3494
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:47,000
and live video sequences that the PC could provide

3495
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:49,000
Was Frank-N-Furter in it though?

3496
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:51,000
because if Frank-N-Furter

3497
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:53,000
is not in it, I mean Tim Curry

3498
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:55,000
single handedly makes

3499
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:57,000
that movie, he does

3500
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:59,000
The screams of

3501
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:01,000
thousands of people when Frank-N-Furter

3502
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:03,000
first shows up in the movie, tell me so

3503
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:05,000
Alright, anyhow

3504
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:07,000
Let's see, other tweets

3505
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:09,000
that we have Twitter.com

3506
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:11,000
Tigerclaw

3507
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:13,000
sends us a link about an Italian city

3508
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:15,000
that's pissed at Gran Turismo 5

3509
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:17,000
Now why would you be angry at Gran Turismo 5?

3510
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:19,000
Well apparently

3511
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:21,000
Siena is a

3512
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:23,000
city in Tuscany, Italy

3513
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:25,000
They're very unhappy that

3514
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:27,000
one of their, I guess

3515
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:29,000
famous roads, the Piazza Del Campo

3516
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:31,000
is actually a race course in

3517
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:33,000
Gran Turismo 5's kart mode

3518
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:35,000
They want it removed in the game

3519
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:37,000
The road is

3520
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:39,000
in the game or the structures or what have you

3521
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:41,000
It's also

3522
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:43,000
I'm just trying to

3523
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:45,000
see what it is here

3524
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:47,000
Sorry, when we get things from Twitter

3525
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:49,000
we haven't had a chance to look at them in advance

3526
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:51,000
or whatever

3527
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:53,000
I guess because it's also partially

3528
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:55,000
a horse race, oh I see

3529
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:57,000
the Piazza Del Campo is also

3530
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:59,000
the name of a famous horse racing track

3531
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:01,000
So I guess they don't want people to kind of get

3532
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:03,000
confused over what's going on there

3533
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:05,000
So they've sent out a quote

3534
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:07,000
diplomatic request to Sony

3535
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:09,000
to resolve the matter

3536
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:11,000
This game is coming out very soon though

3537
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:13,000
so I don't know if it's going to be able to be fixed

3538
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:15,000
unless they patch it out

3539
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:17,000
because that's how they fix everything these days, right?

3540
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:21,000
Let's see

3541
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:23,000
I'll read this one too from Tiger Claw

3542
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:25,000
We give everybody at least two tweets

3543
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:27,000
So Tiger Claw says it's this tweet

3544
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:29,000
Disney Online hits a traffic high

3545
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:31,000
with 36 million monthly

3546
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:33,000
visitors, wow

3547
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:35,000
How much are on Facebook?

3548
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:37,000
How much of that's on Facebook? They don't really get their

3549
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:39,000
users through Facebook, do they?

3550
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:41,000
But they do Club Penguin

3551
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:43,000
You've seen those Club Penguin cards at Target

3552
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:45,000
and all those other stores. That's probably their biggest game there

3553
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:47,000
They also have Toontown Online

3554
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:49,000
Disney Fairies Pixie Hollow

3555
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:51,000
I didn't even know there was a Disney Fairies Pixie Hollow

3556
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:53,000
There you go

3557
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:55,000
So lots and lots of games that Disney has

3558
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:57,000
They've hit quite a milestone there

3559
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:59,000
Never played one of them

3560
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:01,000
I love Penguins too

3561
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:03,000
I don't know why I've never played Club Penguin

3562
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:05,000
but I just haven't

3563
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:07,000
DJ Blazekin sends us a variety of stories

3564
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:09,000
Some of them we're going to be talking about earlier or later

3565
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:11,000
But this one I don't think goes on our showroll

3566
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:13,000
This has to do with other Blizzard stuff

3567
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:15,000
Big things planned for Diablo 3

3568
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:17,000
at this year's BlizzCon

3569
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:19,000
Apparently there is big Diablo 3 news coming out

3570
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:21,000
at BlizzCon this year

3571
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:23,000
It's going to be split into three games

3572
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:25,000
No, let's hope not

3573
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:27,000
I guess this is coming out of

3574
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:29,000
Gamescom. It's the games director

3575
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:31,000
Jay Wilson saying

3576
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:33,000
I can say that this BlizzCon

3577
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:35,000
in terms of Diablo news

3578
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:37,000
will be the biggest one that we've ever had

3579
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:39,000
Well it's probably because that's the game they're going to focus most on

3580
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:41,000
because by that point we ought to know the release date

3581
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:43,000
for Cataclysm

3582
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:45,000
and it'll be out either just before or just after

3583
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:47,000
Did they even have BlizzCon back in

3584
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:49,000
Diablo 2 days?

3585
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:51,000
No, they didn't

3586
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:53,000
Of course it's going to be the one they've had the most time

3587
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:55,000
I don't know what the hell that means

3588
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:57,000
They're going to reveal another playable class in the game

3589
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:59,000
They say there's only going to be one more

3590
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:01,000
a fifth class and they've announced all the others

3591
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:03,000
Cheerleader

3592
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:05,000
Let's hope. Maybe they'll release a peripheral

3593
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:07,000
for the keyboard like they had on

3594
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:09,000
We Cheer. That'd be great

3595
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:11,000
We'll see what happens

3596
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:15,000
You know what's really interesting though about that is that

3597
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:17,000
with Starcraft 2 having had

3598
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:19,000
the digital distribution day one

3599
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:21,000
but Diablo 3 is going to have that too

3600
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:23,000
so I wonder if it's really going to have that big

3601
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:25,000
midnight launch or what have you

3602
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:27,000
I don't know

3603
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:29,000
Let's see. Anyhow

3604
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:31,000
Oh dear

3605
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:33,000
We're getting linked to this by ActDeft

3606
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:35,000
and I just see Furries in the title

3607
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:37,000
so I'm worried about this

3608
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:39,000
He links this to a story from Kotaku that says

3609
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:41,000
Microsoft Connect supports Furries

3610
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:43,000
and it's got a video on it

3611
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:45,000
Do I want to see this?

3612
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:47,000
We know what you're thinking

3613
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:49,000
Will Microsoft Connect read your body

3614
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:51,000
when fully encased in a fur suit?

3615
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:55,000
And again this is coming from Kotaku I guess

3616
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:59,000
Yes and sure enough somebody is dancing there

3617
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:01,000
in a full kitty costume there

3618
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:03,000
to Dance Central

3619
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:05,000
Thank you ActDeft

3620
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:07,000
for wasting 30 seconds of my life

3621
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:09,000
I will never be able to get back

3622
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:11,000
So at Dragon Con over Labor Day weekend

3623
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:13,000
they can yiff

3624
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:15,000
in the privacy of their hotel rooms

3625
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:17,000
or they can get their gaga on

3626
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:19,000
Bobby's going to Dragon Con

3627
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:21,000
I hope he's still listening

3628
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:23,000
Bobby I would really like to request

3629
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:25,000
a full furry report

3630
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:27,000
on the furry scene

3631
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:29,000
at Dragon Con

3632
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:31,000
Bring some Purell

3633
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:33,000
I'd say bring the candle

3634
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:35,000
I saw

3635
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:37,000
DarkKusuke sends us a tweet on Twitter

3636
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:39,000
saying that Star Wars Clone Wars

3637
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:41,000
Open Beta opened today

3638
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:43,000
Really I did not know that

3639
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:45,000
A lot of these big games

3640
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:47,000
coming out the Christmas season

3641
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:49,000
I guess are having their betas open up

3642
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:51,000
When's the DC Universe one open up?

3643
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:53,000
That's the one I really want to play

3644
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:55,000
Really bad

3645
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:57,000
And lastly Alex P. Carson tweets us

3646
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:59,000
saying does anybody know the official name

3647
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:01,000
of the Super Mario version of M.I.A.

3648
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:03,000
Paper Planes that was on the Afterbirth

3649
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:05,000
a while back

3650
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:07,000
That's making me think

3651
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:09,000
There's a website that has tons of chiptunes

3652
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:11,000
and I can't think of the name of it right now

3653
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:13,000
but hopefully somebody in chat will remember

3654
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:15,000
and we found it on there

3655
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:17,000
and I bet if you search for Paper Planes

3656
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:19,000
you could find it

3657
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:21,000
There's some huge chiptunes website

3658
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:23,000
and I can't remember the name of it

3659
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:25,000
like it totally escapes me right now

3660
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:27,000
Somebody in chat will remember what it is

3661
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:29,000
It's like it's just a bunch of homegrown stuff

3662
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:31,000
and if you like that you'll probably like a lot of the stuff that's on there

3663
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:33,000
So hopefully somebody in chat will shout it out here soon

3664
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:35,000
If not I'll Google it in a minute

3665
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:37,000
I'll find it

3666
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:39,000
Let me Google that for you

3667
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:41,000
Alright that's gonna do it for Twitter Topics tonight

3668
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:43,000
Don't miss tweets in the future

3669
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:45,000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R

3670
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:47,000
In the meantime while I try to figure out

3671
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:49,000
what song that was

3672
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:51,000
Loki

3673
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:53,000
This week both the Guitar Hero

3674
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:55,000
Warriors of Rock tracklist

3675
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:57,000
and Rock Band

3676
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:59,000
3 tracklists

3677
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:01,000
were revealed

3678
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:03,000
and it's interesting

3679
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:05,000
because there's definitely a lot of stuff to go over

3680
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:07,000
So let's start off

3681
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:09,000
with Guitar Hero

3682
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:11,000
Warriors of Rock

3683
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:13,000
There's gonna be 93 tracks

3684
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:15,000
I'm not gonna go through all of these

3685
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:17,000
But some of the ones I thought were interesting

3686
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:19,000
Rush 2112

3687
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:21,000
They have all 7 parts of it

3688
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:23,000
That's kind of neat I guess

3689
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:25,000
Let's see

3690
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:27,000
What are some of the ones that stood out to me

3691
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:29,000
Rammstein

3692
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:31,000
They've got a song from them

3693
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:33,000
Looks like

3694
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:35,000
Wade Mann's Hyle

3695
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:37,000
Let's see here

3696
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:39,000
REM Losing My Religion

3697
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:41,000
Queen Bohemian Rhapsody

3698
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:43,000
Of course both games have that

3699
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:45,000
awesome song

3700
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:47,000
By the way there was a Queen

3701
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:49,000
slot machine that I played in Reno

3702
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:51,000
and it's the most amazing

3703
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:53,000
gambling device I've ever played

3704
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:55,000
The bonus

3705
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:57,000
round it lets me pick a Queen song and then

3706
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:59,000
the game plays itself for free for like

3707
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:01,000
a minute while I sit there and listen to Radio Gaga

3708
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:03,000
It's amazing

3709
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:05,000
That's cool

3710
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:07,000
Um

3711
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:09,000
Let's see what other songs on here

3712
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:11,000
Um

3713
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:13,000
They've got like actually a bunch of

3714
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:15,000
Just a bunch of everything

3715
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:17,000
About one song from each artist on here

3716
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:19,000
Some of the ones I actually recognize

3717
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:21,000

Queen's Clearwater Revival

3721
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:29,000
Fortunate Son

3722
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:31,000
Download content from

3723
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:33,000
Rock Band 2

3724
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:35,000
Foreigner feels like the first time

3725
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:39,000
Um

3726
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:41,000
By the way did you see

3727
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:43,000
that video where they

3728
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:45,000
fessed up that the Rock Band 3 leak was real

3729
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:47,000
basically? Yeah they have the

3730
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:49,000
Rock Band full track list behind

3731
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:51,000
them. Yeah that was funny

3732
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:53,000
Um anyway so yeah

3733
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:55,000
lots of stuff, ballista's out there

3734
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:57,000
Um

3735
02:08:57,000 --> 02:08:59,000
Looks pretty cool

3736
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:01,000
And of course Rock Band 3

3737
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:03,000
Uh we've got

3738
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:05,000
Let's see here

3739
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:07,000
Lots of things from there

3740
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:09,000
Um their track list is

3741
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:11,000
a little bit smaller but of course you get all the download content

3742
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:13,000
from Rock Band 2 and

3743
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:15,000
all the tracks from that and anything else

3744
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:17,000
you pretty much have bought

3745
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:19,000
So starting off with that

3746
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:21,000
They have Amy Winehouse in

3747
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:23,000
Rehab but I didn't really think of that as a rock

3748
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:25,000
song but okay

3749
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:27,000
Um

3750
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:29,000
They of course uh let's see here

3751
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:31,000
Devo, Whip It

3752
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:33,000
They have Imagine by John Lennon though

3753
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:35,000
Which I don't think of as a rock song

3754
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:37,000
But I think that's a sweet

3755
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:39,000
addition to the game. Hell yeah

3756
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:41,000
Um one of course I was excited about

3757
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:43,000
when they first announced it

3758
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:45,000
Huey Lewis and the News, The Power of Love

3759
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:47,000
Just need back time now

3760
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:49,000
Perfect

3761
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:51,000
I heard that song a ton at E3, that was in the E3 build

3762
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:53,000
Um

3763
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:55,000

3764
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:57,000

3766
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:01,000
Ozzy Osbourne,

3767
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:03,000
Crazy Train

3768
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:05,000
I know they had another Rammstein song on here

3769
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:07,000
Duhost

3770
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:09,000
Which is pretty cool. Not pussy

3771
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:11,000
Is it in German?

3772
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:13,000
If it is in German that would be great

3773
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:15,000
I have to sort of digress

3774
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:17,000
Why not? That's what we do here on this show

3775
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:19,000
One of the E3 trips, all the DDR Freak

3776
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:21,000
moderators got together and went to the Korean

3777
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:23,000
karaoke place and Duhost was on there

3778
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:25,000
and we were all

3779
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:27,000
singing Duhost in our worst Rammstein

3780
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:29,000
German voices

3781
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:31,000
Duhost mich!

3782
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:33,000
Oh that is great

3783
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:35,000
Um you know Police Don't Stand So Close

3784
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:37,000
to Me

3785
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:39,000
They also had

3786
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:41,000
I hate this song

3787
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:43,000
Smash Mouth Walkin' on the Sun

3788
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:45,000
The Sounds Livin' in America

3789
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:47,000
At least it's not that

3790
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:49,000
Hey now, you're an all-star

3791
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:51,000
It's Avon, get paid

3792
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:53,000
I think that was in Lego Rock Band

3793
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:55,000
I hate that song

3794
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:57,000
Um

3795
02:10:57,000 --> 02:10:59,000
Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers

3796
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:01,000

Curse of Fears, Everybody Wants to Rule the World

3798
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:05,000
Lots of cool stuff

3799
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:07,000
I'm just looking forward to actually being able to play

3800
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:09,000
a lot of these songs with the keyboard

3801
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:11,000
Which would be really sweet

3802
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:13,000
I really hope they go back and add keyboard support

3803
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:15,000
for some of the old classic download songs

3804
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:17,000
Yeah I don't know if they're gonna but

3805
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:19,000
They need to

3806
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:21,000
They really need to

3807
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:23,000
Just sayin'

3808
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:25,000
Oh of course they have Deep Purple, Smoke on the Water

3809
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:27,000
Probably the better at Deep Purple song if you ask me

3810
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:29,000
Alright

3811
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:31,000
By the way, just to answer that tweet from a few minutes ago

3812
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:33,000
Finally found the answer there

3813
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:35,000
We're using my Google FU

3814
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:37,000
The listener's in chatroom and found it already

3815
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:39,000
But just for anybody else who's listening

3816
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:41,000
The artist's name is CSLSX

3817
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:43,000
And the website I was trying to think of

3818
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:45,000
8Bit Collective

3819
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:47,000
Which is actually a really good website for a bunch of chiptunes

3820
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:49,000
The number 8, not spelled out

3821
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:51,000
Actually the number 8, bc.org

3822
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:53,000
And you can get all these NES chiptunes

3823
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:05,000
Actually that was like the worst possible clip

3824
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:07,000
of the song I could play for you guys

3825
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:09,000
But it's not bad, go check it out

3826
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:13,000
More news for you guys

3827
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:15,000
This is about a new peripheral

3828
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:17,000
Which I find kind of interesting

3829
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:19,000
You don't see a whole lot of these

3830
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:21,000
3rd party peripherals, or at least you're not used to

3831
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:23,000
You start seeing more now, like you know

3832
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:25,000
DDR mats, and rock band guitars

3833
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:27,000
And so forth, this is something a little new

3834
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:29,000
THQ is putting out a new game tablet

3835
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:31,000
For the Wii, it's like a drawing

3836
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:33,000
Tablet that you

3837
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:35,000
It's actually kind of like a combination, you put the Wii mode in there

3838
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:37,000
And then you have actually this little tablet

3839
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:39,000
It's called UDraw

3840
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:41,000
It's a 4x6 inch tablet

3841
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:43,000
And it's going to be coming out for the Wii

3842
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:45,000
And it will be coming out for $70

3843
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:47,000
And it comes with UDraw Studio

3844
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:49,000
It's a drawing, coloring, and art based

3845
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:51,000
video game, which I think is kind of cool

3846
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:53,000
Mario Paint! It's Mario Paint basically

3847
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:55,000
And how long have we been saying they need to do

3848
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:57,000
Mario Paint on the Wii, so

3849
02:12:57,000 --> 02:12:59,000
THQ is kind of doing it the way it ought to be done

3850
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:01,000
And what I love too is that one of the promotional

3851
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:03,000
shots here for the game

3852
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:05,000
Is somebody who has drawn

3853
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:07,000
Wait for it, I'm trying to bring it up here in the studio

3854
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:09,000
They've actually drawn on the screen, oh damn

3855
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:11,000
It's a unicorn, somebody drew a unicorn

3856
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:13,000
But unicorn works too

3857
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:15,000
I'm wondering if there would be some way

3858
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:17,000
They're going to make an adapter to use it on the PC or something

3859
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:19,000
Because it's definitely

3860
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:21,000
cheaper than buying a Bluetooth

3861
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:23,000
Adapter

3862
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:25,000
In the end though, I mean

3863
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:27,000
I paid $400 for my tablet

3864
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:29,000
And

3865
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:31,000
I can use Photoshop

3866
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:33,000
But Jamie, can you draw that

3867
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:35,000
bitchin' unicorn? I could draw that unicorn

3868
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:37,000
right now

3869
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:39,000
It just got a hit on Apple a little bit

3870
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:41,000
But the fact that the Wii has a proper

3871
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:43,000
tablet means that it's more of an iPad than the

3872
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:45,000
iPad is

3873
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:47,000
There you go

3874
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:49,000
Look, I'm drawing a unicorn right now

3875
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:51,000
Yay

3876
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:53,000
Actually, you know what, we've been

3877
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:55,000
needing new album art for Orange Lounge Radio

3878
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:57,000
And I'm still waiting on those pictures

3879
02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:59,000
Well I think it should be, you took one of me like

3880
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:01,000
years ago, anyway

3881
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:03,000
No, I think we should just have a giant unicorn

3882
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:05,000
In the album art

3883
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:07,000
Speaking of unicorns, and I know I'm a little bit

3884
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:09,000
behind in times because I used to check

3885
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:11,000
their YouTube feed every now and then

3886
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:13,000
They have a new Charlie

3887
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:15,000
the Unicorn, except it's not Charlie the Unicorn

3888
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:17,000
It's Charlie

3889
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:19,000
Teh-Unicron

3890
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:21,000
And it's like these remixed versions of

3891
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:23,000
the Charlie the Unicorn episodes

3892
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:25,000
And it was hilarious because they burned

3893
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:27,000
down the forest

3894
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:29,000
Candy Mountain

3895
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:31,000
Alright, anyway

3896
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:33,000
Some other games that are coming out

3897
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:35,000
That's not the only game coming out as the Mario

3898
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:37,000
Paint-ish clone

3899
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:39,000
U-Draw will also be getting launch games

3900
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:41,000
Pictionary, because you know, you gotta have more

3901
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:43,000
of the board games on the Wii

3902
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:45,000
And Dude's Big Adventure, that's D-O-O-D

3903
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:47,000
Like, doodle

3904
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:49,000
He, dude

3905
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:51,000
Dude's Big Adventure, it's a world where coloring

3906
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:53,000
books come to life

3907
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:55,000
Apparently it's heavily inspired by the game

3908
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:57,000
Drawn to Life, which was also a THQ game

3909
02:14:57,000 --> 02:14:59,000
So they're just kinda like, you know, getting themselves there

3910
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:01,000
I'm sure the next

3911
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:03,000
Drawn to Life game will support this as well

3912
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:05,000
We'll see

3913
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:07,000
There's your damn unicorn

3914
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:09,000
I can't hold the pen very well

3915
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:11,000
I can't hold my stylus very well to control my

3916
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:13,000
Can you put a picture of that up on orangeontradar.com?

3917
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:15,000
Alright, awesome

3918
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:17,000
Okay

3919
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:19,000
Awesome

3920
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:21,000
So yeah, U-Draw, I don't know, is anyone in here

3921
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:23,000
interested in U-Draw? I guess Dark Soccer made

3922
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:25,000
a pretty good case for it, if it would work on the PC

3923
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:27,000
Nope

3924
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:29,000
Yeah, I'm not really interested either, but I do want an iPad

3925
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:31,000
Nope

3926
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:33,000
I think a lot of

3927
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:35,000
dinner parties have ended in divorce

3928
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:37,000
due to bad rounds of Pictionary

3929
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:39,000
And I'm glad that that experience can come

3930
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:41,000
now, come to the Wii

3931
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:43,000
To a whole new generation

3932
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:45,000
Dark Soccer, I hate to tear you away from

3933
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:47,000
unicorn drawing, but there is more gaming news

3934
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:49,000
to be talked about tonight, correct?

3935
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:51,000
The Doctor

3936
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:53,000
Doctor Who, there's going to be a third

3937
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:55,000
game

3938
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:57,000
Oh, well, a third episode

3939
02:15:57,000 --> 02:15:59,000
of Doctor Who, the adventure games

3940
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:01,000
This one's called TARDIS

3941
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:03,000
And you get to fly the TARDIS

3942
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:05,000
It'll be out on the

3943
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:07,000
27th of August, and

3944
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:09,000
the whole thing is that you have to

3945
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:11,000
explore the entire TARDIS

3946
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:13,000
And the TARDIS is freaking big

3947
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:15,000
Remember, it's bigger on the inside

3948
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:17,000
And

3949
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:19,000
then you can fly the TARDIS

3950
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:21,000
So, that's pretty cool

3951
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:23,000
You know, it's basically

3952
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:25,000
overcoming 40 years

3953
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:27,000
of what's it like to pilot the TARDIS

3954
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:29,000
in one game

3955
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:31,000
Although, really, the TARDIS

3956
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:33,000
is meant to be piloted by six people

3957
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:35,000
It should be a bullet hell game featuring the TARDIS

3958
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:37,000
The TARDIS can't shoot anything

3959
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:39,000
That sounds retard-ous

3960
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:41,000
Anyway, this one's featuring

3961
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:43,000
the 11th Doctor

3962
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:45,000
being Matt Smith

3963
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:47,000
and Amy Pond

3964
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:49,000
played by Karen Gillan

3965
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:51,000
So, pretty cool

3966
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:53,000
And it's free!

3967
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:55,000
For all you people in the UK

3968
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:57,000
Oh yeah, don't we have to pay for it though?

3969
02:16:57,000 --> 02:16:59,000
Because the Brits get it subsidized with their television tax

3970
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:01,000
or whatever, but we have to actually pay for it

3971
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:03,000
Yeah, we don't have TV tax

3972
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:05,000
Lame

3973
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:07,000
I mean, great that we don't have TV tax

3974
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:09,000
Although, Comcast kind of, you know, sends me a

3975
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:11,000
TV tax bill every month, but I guess that's a whole

3976
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:13,000
other issue

3977
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:15,000
You know I am going to be ditching cable TV though

3978
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:17,000
Well, with an HD receiver

3979
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:19,000
Like, I can just go get a good HD

3980
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:21,000
antenna for 50 bucks and I can get my basic

3981
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:23,000
channels, which is all I watch on cable

3982
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:25,000
So, why am I bothering?

3983
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:27,000
Although, I will say cable internet is where it's at

3984
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:29,000
My internet with them

3985
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:31,000
has actually gotten way faster recently

3986
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:33,000
Now I'm getting, you know, about

3987
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:35,000
I don't know what it ends up being

3988
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:37,000
with megabits, but I'm getting about

3989
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:39,000
one and a half megabytes

3990
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:41,000
per second down

3991
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:43,000
I forgot the sparkles

3992
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:45,000
Thanks for downloading things really fast

3993
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:47,000
Plus, we got some more HD channels, so I've been watching

3994
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:49,000
Man vs. Food and

3995
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:51,000
Lots of Ninja Warrior

3996
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:53,000
I did notice a shit ton of new HD channels

3997
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:55,000
I watched six hours of

3998
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:57,000
Ninja Warrior straight one of these days

3999
02:17:57,000 --> 02:17:59,000
because I had to wake up with

4000
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:01,000
Joshua, and he didn't want to go to sleep

4001
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:03,000
and I couldn't change channel

4002
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:05,000
But he didn't want to watch Ninja Warrior

4003
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:07,000
I watched Ninja Warrior, I watched like three seasons of it

4004
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:09,000
I like that you're teaching him young

4005
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:11,000
Ninjas are awesome

4006
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:13,000
Will you be an equal opportunity household where

4007
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:15,000
pirates are also?

4008
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:17,000
If they have a cool pirate game show, then yes

4009
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:19,000
We'll watch the pirate game show, but

4010
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:21,000
Right now it's just Ninja Warrior where it's at

4011
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:23,000
And then of course G4, you know, they have to do

4012
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:25,000
the American Ninja Warrior

4013
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:27,000
And that just, that is about

4014
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:29,000
as bad as the stupid American Iron

4015
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:31,000
Chef, and you know, I hated it

4016
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:33,000
a lot when it first

4017
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:35,000
came out over here, but

4018
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:37,000
now not so much

4019
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:39,000
Just because I don't think I have the Japanese one

4020
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:41,000
to compare it to anymore

4021
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:43,000
Plus, Julie Chen

4022
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:45,000
is a judge a lot on Iron Chef America

4023
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:47,000
And I love Julie Chen, just saying

4024
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:51,000
Wait, what are we talking about now?

4025
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:53,000
You're ditching cable

4026
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:55,000
The Doctor Who game, that was it

4027
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:57,000
We got to the end of it, so it's all you, Logie

4028
02:18:57,000 --> 02:18:59,000
I'm sorry, it was

4029
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:01,000
all these different tangents and I forgot which one

4030
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:03,000
I see you shopping on eBay over there, it's all good

4031
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:05,000
Yeah, I know

4032
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:07,000
I don't even know what I'm looking for, I'm just looking

4033
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:09,000
Because that's what I do

4034
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:11,000
One of the things that's kind of funny

4035
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:13,000
We were talking a little bit about different systems

4036
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:15,000
being hacked, well, something else

4037
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:17,000
that Microsoft had hoped wouldn't have been

4038
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:19,000
hacked, but it was, was the brand

4039
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:21,000
new Xbox 360

4040
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:23,000
system, the S slim, whatever

4041
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:25,000
the hell you want to call it, apparently

4042
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:27,000
the

4043
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:29,000
I guess, mod chip creation

4044
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:31,000
group

4045
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:33,000
Team Executor has been working

4046
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:35,000
closely with Team Jungle, who has created

4047
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:37,000
you know, drive firmwares

4048
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:39,000
for the original

4049
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:41,000
Xbox 360 systems, and

4050
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:43,000
Commodore Forever, also

4051
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:45,000
responsible for

4052
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:47,000
firmwares for those systems and hacking

4053
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:49,000
DVD drives, and now

4054
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:51,000
they have figured out a way

4055
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:53,000
to be able to patch

4056
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:55,000
the DVD rom on those new

4057
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:57,000
slim systems to

4058
02:19:57,000 --> 02:19:59,000
play backups, so yes

4059
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:01,000
they have now created a new hacked

4060
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:03,000
firmware for that

4061
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:05,000
So

4062
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:07,000
They just keep

4063
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:09,000
trying, but they find ways around it

4064
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:11,000
But again, if you

4065
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:13,000
go online with it, bananated

4066
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:15,000
right? Um

4067
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:17,000
I'm not sure, because

4068
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:19,000
I would assume, yes, eventually you'll

4069
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:21,000
probably get banned, but

4070
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:23,000
the newer firmwares nowadays, they have

4071
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:25,000
light touch and stuff like that

4072
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:27,000
are apparently really

4073
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:29,000
stealthy, like it's very hard to detect

4074
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:31,000
them, so

4075
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:33,000
maybe? I don't know, I would assume

4076
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:35,000
eventually, yes, but then again

4077
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:37,000
I have a system at my work

4078
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:39,000
that was supposed to be modded

4079
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:41,000
and it hasn't been banned at all, then again

4080
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:43,000
we've not played one burned game on it, we just

4081
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:45,000
actually, it's funny, I bought it

4082
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:47,000
to replace another modded system, that's

4083
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:49,000
when we decided, hey, you know what, let's just play some

4084
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:51,000
normal Grand Theft Auto games instead of the modded ones

4085
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:53,000
Um, we will be playing the modded ones

4086
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:55,000
again, but we're not modifying our drive

4087
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:57,000
firmware, we're just doing disk swaps, so that

4088
02:20:57,000 --> 02:20:59,000
even if they did detect, you know, that

4089
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:01,000
we were playing a modded game, when they look at the system

4090
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:03,000
the drive's not modded, so

4091
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:05,000
They can't ban me!

4092
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:07,000
Well, they can, but

4093
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:09,000
I would have

4094
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:11,000
a fighting chance

4095
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:15,000
Alright, you don't, you haven't

4096
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:17,000
had to play, you haven't had the opportunity to play

4097
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:19,000
around with one of the new 360 models, right?

4098
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:21,000
I don't really care, I mean

4099
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:23,000
it's neat that they changed, you know, the way

4100
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:25,000
it looks, and I like how it makes little noises and

4101
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:27,000
stuff when you click on the buttons

4102
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:29,000
Um, and apparently there's some like

4103
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:31,000
way, I, or, I remember

4104
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:33,000
now they're gonna have the new sim system

4105
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:35,000
with the Halo stuff

4106
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:37,000
and it's gonna have some different sound effects for that

4107
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:39,000
that's kinda neat, but

4108
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:41,000
yeah, I mean, I don't know

4109
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:43,000
I wouldn't need one of these

4110
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:45,000
but, I don't know

4111
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:47,000
if someone gives one to me, I'm not gonna turn down

4112
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:49,000
Alright, well

4113
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:51,000
do you like to cut in line at big

4114
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:53,000
trade shows, or

4115
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:55,000
I guess not necessarily a trade show, but big conventions

4116
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:57,000
and uh, you know, have everybody hate you?

4117
02:21:57,000 --> 02:21:59,000
Uh, well here you have your

4118
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:01,000
opportunity if you are a member of the gun club

4119
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:03,000
it's uh, Electronic Arts

4120
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:05,000
one of their uh, little promotional clubs

4121
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:07,000
they actually are running a promotion right now

4122
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:09,000
where you got an email

4123
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:11,000
and if you want, you can skip the line

4124
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:13,000
to see Dead Space 2 at Penny Arcade

4125
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:15,000
Expo, if you have a copy of the email

4126
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:17,000
that's right, you can skip the line with a printout

4127
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:19,000
of the email, and uh, Penny Arcade

4128
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:21,000
Expo's coming up in a couple weeks, that same

4129
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:23,000
Labor Day weekend that we're thinking of doing a long show

4130
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:25,000
and uh, there you go, you print out the email

4131
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:27,000
now why hasn't somebody just put the email online

4132
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:29,000
and then you just mass

4133
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:31,000
print it and then go, maybe there's like a barcode

4134
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:33,000
on it or something we're not seeing, I don't know

4135
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:35,000
probably, no, I don't think that's the case

4136
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:37,000
I think it's just people don't want to do that

4137
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:39,000
so that, you know, the line for that is

4138
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:41,000
really long, why would they, well

4139
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:43,000
it's gonna have the same line anyway, you know

4140
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:45,000
it's, exactly, and you know

4141
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:47,000
what, and it, it does suck, but then

4142
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:49,000
again, it's their booth space that they're, they

4143
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:51,000
paid for, they can do whatever the hell they want

4144
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:53,000
it's a strange precedent to be setting

4145
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:55,000
I mean, I, the only weird

4146
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:57,000
oddity about it for me is that, you know, and I

4147
02:22:57,000 --> 02:22:59,000
made a big mistake calling it a trade show earlier

4148
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:01,000
because it's not, but PAX is more of a

4149
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:03,000
convention, and I always thought one of the things

4150
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:05,000
that was supposed to kind of separate it is that

4151
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:07,000
everybody was on equal footing, like media

4152
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:09,000
doesn't get special treatment there, you're not

4153
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:11,000
supposed to be doing all these like media appointments

4154
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:13,000
and things, like that's what E3 is for, even though

4155
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:15,000
especially the years that E3

4156
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:17,000
went to

4157
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:19,000
the airport

4158
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:21,000
in Santa Monica or wherever it was, PAX

4159
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:23,000
kind of started to get a little more of that

4160
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:25,000
uh, where, you know, you could get in early if you

4161
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:27,000
were media and so forth, but I always thought PAX was supposed to be

4162
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:29,000
this place where everybody's on equal ground

4163
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:31,000
so, then, why

4164
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:33,000
is it now that some people are

4165
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:35,000
special, but of course, you know, again, it's

4166
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:37,000
this company, their email list, they're just

4167
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:39,000
trying to pimp the service, the gun club

4168
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:41,000
they're trying to pimp it to make it have some values

4169
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:43,000
so that people can sign up for it

4170
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:45,000
I don't remember if it costs anything, I think it's just

4171
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:47,000
I know you, like, for example, if you buy that

4172
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:49,000
Battlefield Ultimate, uh, you know, Battlefield

4173
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:51,000
Bad Company 2 Ultimate Edition or whatever

4174
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:53,000
you get membership into the gun club

4175
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:55,000
I don't remember if it costs anything

4176
02:23:55,000 --> 02:23:57,000
initially to sign up or whatever

4177
02:23:57,000 --> 02:23:59,000
but you get, like, you know, into the Medal of Honor

4178
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:01,000
beta, um, early

4179
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:03,000
and stuff like that, so it's little

4180
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:05,000
tidbits of that kind of thing that are supposed to

4181
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:07,000
I guess they're making it worthwhile

4182
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:09,000
but, um

4183
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:11,000
I don't know, like I said, they're a booth, they can

4184
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:13,000
do whatever the hell they want

4185
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:15,000
Toagak in our chatroom at chat.orangelandre.com

4186
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:17,000
says, I like the whole, we don't care if you are

4187
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:19,000
media stuff, believe it or not, me too

4188
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:21,000
I, and I wish they did the same thing at E3

4189
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:23,000
I know that sounds weird, cause, like, you know

4190
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:25,000
I, I, you know, can get media

4191
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:27,000
credentials for E3, but I just, I kinda

4192
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:29,000
like it when everybody's in the same footy, but E3

4193
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:31,000
you can't see E3 anymore without

4194
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:33,000
Here's the thing with E3, planning it out six months

4195
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:35,000
in advance, even if you do get media credentials

4196
02:24:35,000 --> 02:24:37,000
it still doesn't matter, because

4197
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:39,000
they basically look at you

4198
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:41,000
they're like, oh, well you're not IGN

4199
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:43,000
or, you know, 1up

4200
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:45,000
or whatever, so, well we don't

4201
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:47,000
know who you are, so we don't care

4202
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:49,000
you know, so it doesn't matter, you can get

4203
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:51,000
it's because a lot of the marketing people

4204
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:53,000
behind video games, don't play

4205
02:24:53,000 --> 02:24:55,000
video games, and know nothing about video games

4206
02:24:55,000 --> 02:24:57,000
there's so many of them out there

4207
02:24:57,000 --> 02:24:59,000
that just don't

4208
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:01,000
they don't even know the product that they're

4209
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:03,000
selling Oh yeah, I know that, I deal with a lot of

4210
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:05,000
corporate sales reps from these

4211
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:07,000
companies that are talking about the games coming on

4212
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:09,000
and I start asking a question about stuff and they're like

4213
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:11,000
I don't know, I don't play games, it's like

4214
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:13,000
you know, you don't even know your own product?

4215
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:15,000
I mean, come on

4216
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:17,000
It's pretty astounding

4217
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:19,000
kind of sad though

4218
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:21,000
but

4219
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:23,000
we just have to support those companies that

4220
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:25,000
you know, know what they're doing

4221
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:27,000
just like Konami, they don't like to

4222
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:29,000
invite us anymore to things, but I understand

4223
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:31,000
they're not in San Francisco anymore, but

4224
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:33,000
so what, you know, you can at least send the damn

4225
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:35,000
invite, and if we can't make it, that's not a big deal

4226
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:37,000
well, the DDR thing was public, and I thought

4227
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:39,000
that was great

4228
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:41,000
yeah, that was a great way to do it

4229
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:43,000
exactly, let all the people who really want to see it, go see it

4230
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:45,000
alright, anyhow, let's

4231
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:47,000
open up the mailbag

4232
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:49,000
yay, every week you guys send us emails

4233
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:51,000
here at mailbag at orangelandrado.com

4234
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:53,000
we select a few of our favorites

4235
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:55,000
and read them here on air

4236
02:25:55,000 --> 02:25:57,000
mailbag at orangelandrado.com

4237
02:25:57,000 --> 02:25:59,000
looks like our mailbag is very full from that mail we got

4238
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:01,000
I'm not reading all of them

4239
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:03,000
so don't be

4240
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:05,000
butthurt if you don't get your email read

4241
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:07,000
basically if it was one asking us to advertise

4242
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:09,000
usernames, or asking us about

4243
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:11,000
advertising, or asking us

4244
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:13,000
about those types of things, we'll be replying

4245
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:15,000
to you offline

4246
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:17,000
um, first one up

4247
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:19,000
um, hello O.L.R.

4248
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:21,000
Haseo Sumi

4249
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:23,000
uh, I can't say anything

4250
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:25,000
Haseo Sumi Ragawa

4251
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:27,000
um, hey, or Pliskin, as it was

4252
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:29,000
in my last email, yes, it's a Metal Gear Solid reference

4253
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:31,000
um, if Rob still

4254
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:33,000
hates Justin Bieber, have him watch this, whatever

4255
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:35,000
um, sorry, it's a

4256
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:37,000
a video that I haven't pulled up

4257
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:39,000
oh, everybody saw, it's probably him

4258
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:41,000
getting hit with a water bottle

4259
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:43,000
I saw the Keyboard Cat

4260
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:45,000
version of that

4261
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:47,000
and Dark Sakura, if you still love Doctor Who

4262
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:49,000
I have a video for you, and I pulled it up and I'll watch it later

4263
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:51,000
it's the Mighty Morphin' Dalek Rangers

4264
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:53,000
and on to non-Bieber

4265
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:55,000
stuff, um, okay, I tried to

4266
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:57,000
download a shady copy of Bleach Heat

4267
02:26:57,000 --> 02:26:59,000
the Soul 6 for a Japanese game site

4268
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:01,000
but for some reason it keeps saying

4269
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:03,000
corrupted or unsupported data, any suggestions?

4270
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:05,000
punctuation?

4271
02:27:05,000 --> 02:27:07,000
um, no, I'm kidding, um

4272
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:09,000
I would say, um

4273
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:11,000
check your region

4274
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:13,000
what?

4275
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:15,000
what was the question?

4276
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:17,000
it downloaded a copy of Bleach Heat

4277
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:19,000
the Soul 6 from a

4278
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:21,000
Japanese game site

4279
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:23,000
but it says corrupted or unsupported

4280
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:25,000
data is that through an emulator

4281
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:27,000
or through a console? it didn't say

4282
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:29,000
he downloaded it?

4283
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:31,000
give us more details, dude you get what you pay

4284
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:33,000
for, I mean

4285
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:35,000
re-download it

4286
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:37,000
I don't know, if it's a PC game

4287
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:39,000
then it sounds like it's just a corrupted download

4288
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:41,000
and you have to re-download it

4289
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:43,000
if you're downloading a pirated version of a game

4290
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:45,000
of some sort, um

4291
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:47,000
perhaps you need to burn it at a lower

4292
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:49,000
lower speed

4293
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:51,000
if you're pirating a current game

4294
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:53,000
I don't think we can really help you

4295
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:55,000
I mean, you're not supposed to be doing that, naughty naughty

4296
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:57,000
if this is a game I don't recognize

4297
02:27:57,000 --> 02:27:59,000
from like 10, 15 years ago

4298
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:01,000
they don't make anymore

4299
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:03,000
well then, we can't help you

4300
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:05,000
I think it's a PC game

4301
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:07,000
if you bought it legitimately

4302
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:09,000
then call the people who made the game

4303
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:11,000
they can answer

4304
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:13,000
he said shady

4305
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:15,000
and third I would like to thank Rob

4306
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:17,000
for his advice on an earlier episode

4307
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:19,000
what you said helped, I told my friend

4308
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:21,000
but not family for certain reasons

4309
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:23,000
and I'm currently dating someone, once again thanks

4310
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:25,000
oh, I'm glad to hear things worked out

4311
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:27,000
I remember that email

4312
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:29,000
so, um, good

4313
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:31,000
I'm really really glad to hear it

4314
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:33,000
and thank you Dark Soccer for reading my email

4315
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:35,000
if you didn't, what the hell?

4316
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:37,000
well, fine, thank you

4317
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:39,000
thanks as always, your loyal listener, Haseo Sumiragawa

4318
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:41,000
well, I'm

4319
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:43,000
very glad, I hope my

4320
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:45,000
headache hasn't made me too grumpy when reading it

4321
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:47,000
um, oh, good lord

4322
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:49,000
long

4323
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:51,000
email

4324
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:53,000
helping Akai Ripper

4325
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:55,000
might be the longest meal in

4326
02:28:55,000 --> 02:28:57,000
OLR history, I don't know, it might be

4327
02:28:57,000 --> 02:28:59,000
good morning

4328
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:01,000
everyone, this is the other Swede, Jiditz

4329
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:03,000
writing in, I usually

4330
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:05,000
rant about something, or comment

4331
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:07,000
on things that were brought up during the last live show

4332
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:09,000
but not this time

4333
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:11,000
during episode 376, which is the show

4334
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:13,000
before the previous one, Akai Ripper called in

4335
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:15,000
and told us of his angst and how Blizzard had wronged him

4336
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:17,000
seeing as that episode

4337
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:19,000
went up kind of late, I didn't have time

4338
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:21,000
to listen to the episode before the next

4339
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:23,000
one aired, and couldn't share my knowledge

4340
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:25,000
and experience when it comes to activating and playing

4341
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:27,000
Starcraft 2, all that is about to change

4342
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:29,000
so hold onto your socks and put your pants back

4343
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:31,000
on because it's, what?

4344
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:33,000
because it's time for a story of epic proportions

4345
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:35,000
filled to the brim with angst

4346
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:37,000
I have to put my pants back on

4347
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:39,000
yeah, cause Rob's been

4348
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:41,000
sitting here pantsless the whole time

4349
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:43,000
I'm comfortable

4350
02:29:43,000 --> 02:29:45,000
twas the morning of the 27th

4351
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:47,000
of July and the first thing I heard

4352
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:49,000
was the blaring of my alarm clock

4353
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:51,000
proclaiming it was the time for me to get up

4354
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:53,000
had approached

4355
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:55,000
excuse me

4356
02:29:55,000 --> 02:29:57,000
didn't mean to do

4357
02:29:57,000 --> 02:29:59,000
with slow steps I went up to the kitchen

4358
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:01,000
to prepare my breakfast which on this

4359
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:03,000
specific day consisted of two slices of toast

4360
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:05,000
and a cup of coffee, the perfect combination

4361
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:07,000
of breakfast items if you ask me

4362
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:09,000
after gulping down my coffee

4363
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:11,000
I went to feed Gullen, my polar bear cub

4364
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:13,000
and then

4365
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:15,000
oh my god, get to the point, like

4366
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:17,000
I appreciated the storytelling, but

4367
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:19,000
hold on, and then proceeded to get ready

4368
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:21,000
to leave the house, now you may think

4369
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:23,000
I went up early to stand in line to get my copy of

4370
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:25,000
Starcraft 2, but you were sorely mistaken

4371
02:30:25,000 --> 02:30:27,000
you see, during the summer break I managed to acquire

4372
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:29,000
an ingrown nail on my big toe on both my

4373
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:31,000
feet, ow, this made walking

4374
02:30:31,000 --> 02:30:33,000
overall quite painful, so I promptly got in touch with my

4375
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:35,000
doctor who had a spot open during the

4376
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:37,000
27th of July, Starcraft 2 day

4377
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:39,000
after a swift drive to the doctor's office

4378
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:41,000
and later an extra 20 minutes of waiting

4379
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:43,000
I finally get placed atop one of those

4380
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:45,000
odd beds they have at the hospital and the

4381
02:30:45,000 --> 02:30:47,000
doctor arrives, oh lord

4382
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:49,000
ok, ok, ok, ok, ok, look

4383
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:51,000
I realize we're all about where every gamer

4384
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:53,000
has a voice, and you know, I

4385
02:30:53,000 --> 02:30:55,000
want everybody to have their say, but

4386
02:30:55,000 --> 02:30:57,000
next time let's just try

4387
02:30:57,000 --> 02:30:59,000
some shit went down, and

4388
02:30:59,000 --> 02:31:01,000
no, I'm trying to see if there's a point

4389
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:03,000
Jamie Summers is not your LiveJournal client

4390
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:05,000
no I'm not, some

4391
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:07,000
and I feel really bad about your

4392
02:31:07,000 --> 02:31:09,000
ingrown toenails, dude

4393
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:11,000
you know what, I

4394
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:13,000
I think, get a LiveJournal

4395
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:15,000
I think Alan's making

4396
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:17,000
a really good point there

4397
02:31:17,000 --> 02:31:19,000
I feel like an ass now, I'm sorry

4398
02:31:19,000 --> 02:31:21,000
that was really nice, but

4399
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:23,000
I'm not trying to be rude, but it's a

4400
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:25,000
3 hour show, not 10

4401
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:27,000
we can read this email during the

4402
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:29,000
Labor Day show, I'm gonna read

4403
02:31:29,000 --> 02:31:31,000
I wanna read out of it, fine

4404
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:33,000
after all the crap with the doctor

4405
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:35,000
paraphrasing of course

4406
02:31:35,000 --> 02:31:37,000
I wondered how

4407
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:39,000
I could get the damn game, I thought

4408
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:41,000
I could get it at home, so I went home

4409
02:31:41,000 --> 02:31:43,000
I'm paraphrasing now, ok

4410
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:45,000
thank you

4411
02:31:45,000 --> 02:31:47,000
you turn it on, start a firefox

4412
02:31:47,000 --> 02:31:49,000
pull out the credit card

4413
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:51,000
and then

4414
02:31:51,000 --> 02:31:53,000
Blizzard wanted to pay 60 euros

4415
02:31:53,000 --> 02:31:55,000
which is about 589

4416
02:31:55,000 --> 02:31:57,000
point 80 Swedish kronor

4417
02:31:57,000 --> 02:31:59,000
which is 77 bucks

4418
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:01,000
for the digital purpose

4419
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:03,000
at the local store it's 399 kronor

4420
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:05,000
which is 52 dollars

4421
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:07,000
so to buy a physical copy

4422
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:09,000
it cost him 20 bucks cheaper

4423
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:11,000
to go get the physical copy

4424
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:13,000
so he did that

4425
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:15,000
blah blah blah blah blah

4426
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:17,000
gonna install it, gonna play

4427
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:19,000
no, ok

4428
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:21,000
now this is where I'm gonna read the email again

4429
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:23,000
cause I'm pretty down into it now

4430
02:32:23,000 --> 02:32:25,000
the game said my Blizzard account did not have an

4431
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:27,000
activated copy of the game associated to it

4432
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:29,000
which I found to be strange since I had seen

4433
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:31,000
with my own eyes, a quick google search revealed

4434
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:33,000
I was not alone with this problem, but I was sad

4435
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:35,000
that no one had found a way to fix it

4436
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:37,000
so now we get to the point that might be able

4437
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:39,000
thank you, might be able to help everyone

4438
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:41,000
who has a similar problem, specifically

4439
02:32:41,000 --> 02:32:43,000
OkRipper, and having problems

4440
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:45,000
getting through to the customer service support line

4441
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:47,000
just email customer support

4442
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:49,000
I emailed Blizzard support explaining my problem

4443
02:32:49,000 --> 02:32:51,000
which I had, you know, what I had tried

4444
02:32:51,000 --> 02:32:53,000
and that I would love some information on what I was doing wrong

4445
02:32:53,000 --> 02:32:55,000
within 6 hours I had gotten a reply that said they had

4446
02:32:55,000 --> 02:32:57,000
fixed the problem with the following

4447
02:32:57,000 --> 02:32:59,000
and the following attempt to play Starcraft 2

4448
02:32:59,000 --> 02:33:01,000
was successful, and it was beautiful

4449
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:03,000
alright, story time isn't

4450
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:05,000
is over, but this email isn't

4451
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:07,000
so straighten up your backs and get ready for

4452
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:09,000
Jiditz Indie Game of the Century

4453
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:11,000
uhhh

4454
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:13,000
there's codes

4455
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:15,000
oh, sweet, codes

4456
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:17,000
oh, are we supposed to read the entire email

4457
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:19,000
and then light the codes for the reward? oops

4458
02:33:19,000 --> 02:33:21,000
I've been giving this guy a hard time

4459
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:23,000
toigak in chatroom says, control F

4460
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:25,000
point

4461
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:27,000
hahahahaha

4462
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:29,000
my point is

4463
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:31,000
so

4464
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:33,000
my friend who happens to be the developer finishes

4465
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:35,000

4477
02:33:57,000 --> 02:33:59,000

4478
02:33:59,000 --> 02:34:01,000

4479
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:03,000

4481
02:34:05,000 --> 02:34:07,000
to some fans later in the week

4482
02:34:07,000 --> 02:34:09,000
I will actually save this

4483
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:11,000
email then

4484
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:13,000
but I might keep a code for myself

4485
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:15,000
I want to play it

4486
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:17,000
PS, big thanks to Dark Saga for reading this long email

4487
02:34:17,000 --> 02:34:19,000
umm kind of

4488
02:34:19,000 --> 02:34:21,000
oops

4489
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:23,000
oops

4490
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:25,000
oops

4491
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:27,000
oops

4492
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:29,000
to tell you a story

4493
02:34:29,000 --> 02:34:31,000
I would have believed the polar bear

4494
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:33,000
and I'll tell you why

4495
02:34:33,000 --> 02:34:35,000
when Lord Byron

4496
02:34:35,000 --> 02:34:37,000
you know the poet, went to college

4497
02:34:37,000 --> 02:34:39,000
he was not allowed to have

4498
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:41,000
the rules were no dogs allowed on campus

4499
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:43,000
but it did not say anything about a bear

4500
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:45,000
so he had a pet bear

4501
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:47,000
I think when he went to Cambridge

4502
02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:49,000
true story

4503
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:51,000
true facts

4504
02:34:51,000 --> 02:34:53,000
so the polar bear could have been possible

4505
02:34:53,000 --> 02:34:55,000
I wanted to know what kind of toothpaste

4506
02:34:55,000 --> 02:34:57,000
he used, I could have

4507
02:34:57,000 --> 02:34:59,000
used what type of magazines

4508
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:01,000
in the doctor's office

4509
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:03,000
so yeah

4510
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:05,000
I just don't think your email was detailed enough

4511
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:07,000
to get a sense of

4512
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:09,000
the situation

4513
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:11,000
and dire urgency

4514
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:13,000
I moved it

4515
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:15,000
to the inbox

4516
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:17,000
I'm glad to hear that emailing blizzard support

4517
02:35:17,000 --> 02:35:19,000
was a great option

4518
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:21,000
I just want to say though like you could have condensed

4519
02:35:21,000 --> 02:35:23,000
that down to twitter size

4520
02:35:23,000 --> 02:35:25,000
tell akehripper to email them

4521
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:27,000
just

4522
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:29,000
move to inbox

4523
02:35:29,000 --> 02:35:31,000
here's some codes

4524
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:33,000
no I'm giving this poor guy a hard time

4525
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:35,000
we do appreciate the email

4526
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:37,000
I'm sorry I paraphrased

4527
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:39,000
but I did read it

4528
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:41,000
and it was entertaining

4529
02:35:41,000 --> 02:35:43,000
and I want a polar bear now

4530
02:35:43,000 --> 02:35:45,000
I'm just going to replace the pony

4531
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:47,000
you know when I go to a restaurant

4532
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:49,000
and someone says is there anything else you'd like

4533
02:35:49,000 --> 02:35:51,000
say a pony

4534
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:53,000
now I'm going to say a polar bear, thank you

4535
02:35:53,000 --> 02:35:55,000
yeah because one time you ended up getting a coney

4536
02:35:55,000 --> 02:35:57,000
when you asked for a pony the waitress brought you a

4537
02:35:57,000 --> 02:35:59,000
coney dog and I laughed

4538
02:35:59,000 --> 02:36:01,000
I took it home to Dan though and he ate it

4539
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:03,000
and you totally felt guilty like the waitress was

4540
02:36:03,000 --> 02:36:05,000
going to take it back going oh

4541
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:07,000
you were trying to be funny

4542
02:36:07,000 --> 02:36:09,000
oh I see

4543
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:11,000
people usually do laugh

4544
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:13,000
blame the sonic intercom

4545
02:36:13,000 --> 02:36:15,000
speaker

4546
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:17,000
by the way one of the sonics in Roseville closed

4547
02:36:17,000 --> 02:36:19,000
just so you know

4548
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:21,000
I know the one that was built into the

4549
02:36:21,000 --> 02:36:23,000
what's up with that

4550
02:36:23,000 --> 02:36:25,000
where was the other one

4551
02:36:25,000 --> 02:36:27,000
there's one over on

4552
02:36:27,000 --> 02:36:29,000
I'm sure our international listeners

4553
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:31,000
in Mexico really appreciate this talk

4554
02:36:31,000 --> 02:36:33,000
but I think it's over on like Paradise

4555
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:35,000
Grove or whatever that street is called

4556
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:37,000
you know what I'm talking about Office 65

4557
02:36:37,000 --> 02:36:39,000
go up 65

4558
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:41,000
and there's like a

4559
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:43,000
Pleasant Grove that's it

4560
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:45,000
Pleasant Grove

4561
02:36:45,000 --> 02:36:47,000
that's where it is

4562
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:49,000
over by Walmart

4563
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:51,000
by Walmart

4564
02:36:51,000 --> 02:36:53,000
I think it was the first day you ever met Alan

4565
02:36:53,000 --> 02:36:55,000
yes it was

4566
02:36:55,000 --> 02:36:57,000
and we had tater tots and it was magical

4567
02:36:57,000 --> 02:36:59,000
next

4568
02:36:59,000 --> 02:37:01,000
up

4569
02:37:01,000 --> 02:37:03,000

02:37:05,000 --> 02:37:07,000
I'm not reading it kid whatever

4572
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:09,000
it's been a while since I've talked to you

4573
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:11,000
I'm not sure if you've kept up on the money

4574
02:37:11,000 --> 02:37:13,000
related to music activities

4575
02:37:13,000 --> 02:37:15,000
I've been doing but I have some new

4576
02:37:15,000 --> 02:37:17,000

4577
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:19,000

4578
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:21,000

02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:31,000

oh this

4611
02:38:25,000 --> 02:38:27,000
is cool it's from robaba

4612
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:29,000
and it's actually someone I'm a fan of

4613
02:38:29,000 --> 02:38:31,000
um writer Peter David posted

4614
02:38:31,000 --> 02:38:33,000
on his blog that he is writing the Tron

4615
02:38:33,000 --> 02:38:35,000
comic book I'm not sure if it will

4616
02:38:35,000 --> 02:38:37,000
be released as a graphic novel

4617
02:38:37,000 --> 02:38:39,000
it probably will as it catches up

4618
02:38:39,000 --> 02:38:41,000
on the story behind Tron Legacy

4619
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:43,000
I'm not a fanboy much but I am a

4620
02:38:43,000 --> 02:38:45,000
Tron fanboy I actually like Peter David

4621
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:47,000
and I've read um

4622
02:38:47,000 --> 02:38:49,000
some of his Star Trek novels

4623
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:51,000
and I think he wrote

4624
02:38:51,000 --> 02:38:53,000
the novelization for Iron Man

4625
02:38:53,000 --> 02:38:55,000
so it was I like

4626
02:38:55,000 --> 02:38:57,000
his writing a lot so

4627
02:38:57,000 --> 02:38:59,000
all I know about Tron is that I heard a rumor

4628
02:38:59,000 --> 02:39:01,000
this week that the Muppet

4629
02:39:01,000 --> 02:39:03,000
3D theater at California Adventure

4630
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:05,000
is supposed to be being transformed into a Tron

4631
02:39:05,000 --> 02:39:07,000
3D preview I know

4632
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:09,000
right? that's pretty much

4633
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:11,000
the same noise I made when I heard

4634
02:39:13,000 --> 02:39:15,000
I didn't quite

4635
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:17,000
make that noise but close

4636
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:19,000
is that it for emails? no

4637
02:39:19,000 --> 02:39:21,000
like I said we have a bunch and I'm only reading a few

4638
02:39:21,000 --> 02:39:23,000
another one from robaba

4639
02:39:23,000 --> 02:39:25,000
now that Microsoft announced Windows Phone 7

4640
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:27,000
a near random thought came to mind

4641
02:39:27,000 --> 02:39:29,000
is Game Room meant for the mobile phone?

4642
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:31,000
it also has a heavy emphasis

4643
02:39:31,000 --> 02:39:33,000
on games in your live account

4644
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:35,000
I think they are smart to do this

4645
02:39:35,000 --> 02:39:37,000
since games would be one of the few things

4646
02:39:37,000 --> 02:39:39,000
to rope people in you know they actually

4647
02:39:39,000 --> 02:39:41,000
what was

4648
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:43,000
what was Microsoft's the Zune

4649
02:39:43,000 --> 02:39:45,000
were they

4650
02:39:45,000 --> 02:39:47,000
were they supposed to have had Zune integration

4651
02:39:47,000 --> 02:39:49,000
for Xbox Live

4652
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:51,000
Indie Games I think was a rumor a while back

4653
02:39:51,000 --> 02:39:53,000
that XNA would play on the Zune 2

4654
02:39:53,000 --> 02:39:55,000
remember that thing at E3 where we sat on the big floor

4655
02:39:55,000 --> 02:39:57,000
with the subwoofer built into it

4656
02:39:57,000 --> 02:39:59,000
and it vibrated your butt every time the bass

4657
02:39:59,000 --> 02:40:01,000
would go loud and they had the phone

4658
02:40:01,000 --> 02:40:03,000
integration thing and people pulling

4659
02:40:03,000 --> 02:40:05,000
them around for their big pitch

4660
02:40:05,000 --> 02:40:07,000
yeah yeah

4661
02:40:07,000 --> 02:40:09,000
I don't remember what it was called

4662
02:40:09,000 --> 02:40:11,000
but I guess Microsoft

4663
02:40:11,000 --> 02:40:13,000
released a smartphone that came

4664
02:40:13,000 --> 02:40:15,000
and went in like three months

4665
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:17,000
I posted it out on my Facebook

4666
02:40:17,000 --> 02:40:19,000
is that this Windows Phone?

4667
02:40:19,000 --> 02:40:21,000
it had a very

4668
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:23,000
specific brand name

4669
02:40:23,000 --> 02:40:25,000
like a Zune obviously

4670
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:27,000
but that's their music player

4671
02:40:27,000 --> 02:40:29,000
but there was a Microsoft phone

4672
02:40:29,000 --> 02:40:31,000
that was out for two months

4673
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:33,000
I had never even heard of it and they were like

4674
02:40:33,000 --> 02:40:35,000
oh the kin

4675
02:40:35,000 --> 02:40:37,000
I remember they had the girl on Facebook

4676
02:40:37,000 --> 02:40:39,000
going around and meeting people

4677
02:40:39,000 --> 02:40:41,000
and people were like who the fuck are you

4678
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:43,000
anyway

4679
02:40:43,000 --> 02:40:45,000
ooh a hard

4680
02:40:45,000 --> 02:40:47,000
question

4681
02:40:47,000 --> 02:40:49,000
yay

4682
02:40:49,000 --> 02:40:51,000
what I'm excited

4683
02:40:51,000 --> 02:40:53,000
you're as exciting as being

4684
02:40:53,000 --> 02:40:55,000
forced to eat Robin's minstrels

4685
02:40:55,000 --> 02:40:57,000
greetings

4686
02:40:57,000 --> 02:40:59,000
I come here today with a question about morality

4687
02:40:59,000 --> 02:41:01,000
I've always been a PC gamer

4688
02:41:01,000 --> 02:41:03,000
and usually pay between 20 to 50 bucks

4689
02:41:03,000 --> 02:41:05,000
for games Wheel of morality

4690
02:41:05,000 --> 02:41:07,000
turn turn turn tell us the lesson

4691
02:41:07,000 --> 02:41:09,000
that we should learn

4692
02:41:09,000 --> 02:41:11,000
and today's moral is

4693
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:13,000
early to rise

4694
02:41:13,000 --> 02:41:15,000
and early to bed may make a man wise

4695
02:41:15,000 --> 02:41:17,000
but socially dead

4696
02:41:17,000 --> 02:41:19,000
read the damn email

4697
02:41:19,000 --> 02:41:21,000
and as long as I've got some good time

4698
02:41:21,000 --> 02:41:23,000
out of it I'm fine paying that

4699
02:41:23,000 --> 02:41:25,000
now I won't lie and say I haven't gotten

4700
02:41:25,000 --> 02:41:27,000
some games by other means either

4701
02:41:27,000 --> 02:41:29,000
now to my problem I've recently bought a PS3

4702
02:41:29,000 --> 02:41:31,000
and am appalled that there isn't

4703
02:41:31,000 --> 02:41:33,000
fire and blood protesting

4704
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:35,000
at these $60

4705
02:41:35,000 --> 02:41:37,000
price points for games

4706
02:41:37,000 --> 02:41:39,000
as game companies whine when their games

4707
02:41:39,000 --> 02:41:41,000
don't make tons of profit

4708
02:41:41,000 --> 02:41:43,000
you know as well as I do

4709
02:41:43,000 --> 02:41:45,000
that when Steam puts a game up for 50% off sale

4710
02:41:45,000 --> 02:41:47,000
it sells like hotcakes and the developer makes

4711
02:41:47,000 --> 02:41:49,000
money has there been any PS3

4712
02:41:49,000 --> 02:41:51,000
game developers that put their game up for

4713
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:53,000
40 to 50 bucks I wonder if they

4714
02:41:53,000 --> 02:41:55,000
would sell more

4715
02:41:55,000 --> 02:41:57,000
and thus make more

4716
02:41:57,000 --> 02:41:59,000
3D Dot Game Heroes was

4717
02:41:59,000 --> 02:42:01,000
$39.99 maybe

4718
02:42:01,000 --> 02:42:03,000
$49.99 but it was in that price range

4719
02:42:03,000 --> 02:42:05,000
you talk about there I believe

4720
02:42:05,000 --> 02:42:07,000
in America it sold

4721
02:42:07,000 --> 02:42:09,000
$150K which isn't

4722
02:42:09,000 --> 02:42:11,000
terrible but I

4723
02:42:11,000 --> 02:42:13,000
don't know if it'll have a sequel

4724
02:42:13,000 --> 02:42:15,000
actually for an atlas game that's really good

4725
02:42:15,000 --> 02:42:17,000
but it also came out around the same time as Lost Planet 2

4726
02:42:17,000 --> 02:42:19,000
Escape 3, Red Dead Redemption

4727
02:42:19,000 --> 02:42:21,000
split second blur

4728
02:42:21,000 --> 02:42:23,000
and that is also one game

4729
02:42:23,000 --> 02:42:25,000
and I can't think of a whole lot

4730
02:42:25,000 --> 02:42:27,000
that were cheaper I guess Super Street Fighter 2 was cheaper

4731
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:29,000
yes

4732
02:42:29,000 --> 02:42:31,000
it was also you know an upgrade

4733
02:42:31,000 --> 02:42:33,000
to a game that you'd already paid

4734
02:42:33,000 --> 02:42:35,000
50 bucks for before

4735
02:42:35,000 --> 02:42:37,000
well now he's saying I've included a link

4736
02:42:37,000 --> 02:42:39,000
to the new PS3 USB hack that might be real

4737
02:42:39,000 --> 02:42:41,000
of course we covered it earlier

4738
02:42:41,000 --> 02:42:43,000
and to be truthful at $60 a game is it a little

4739
02:42:43,000 --> 02:42:45,000
it is a little tempting what do you guys think about it

4740
02:42:45,000 --> 02:42:47,000
your loyal turtle in Philly

4741
02:42:47,000 --> 02:42:49,000
is serious turtle

4742
02:42:49,000 --> 02:42:51,000
um

4743
02:42:51,000 --> 02:42:53,000
games are expensive but they've always been

4744
02:42:53,000 --> 02:42:55,000
expensive Street Fighter 2

4745
02:42:55,000 --> 02:42:57,000
speaking of which since we're talking about all these Street Fighter games

4746
02:42:57,000 --> 02:42:59,000
the original cartridge was what 70 bucks

4747
02:42:59,000 --> 02:43:01,000
Mortal Kombat was that bad

4748
02:43:01,000 --> 02:43:03,000
Chrono Trigger was pushin' 80 at one point

4749
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:05,000
killer instinct I paid 60 bucks for

4750
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:07,000
at Montgomery Wards

4751
02:43:07,000 --> 02:43:09,000
and keep in mind this is

4752
02:43:09,000 --> 02:43:11,000
10-15 years ago without inflation

4753
02:43:11,000 --> 02:43:13,000
oh no no no I was still in high school

4754
02:43:13,000 --> 02:43:15,000
no I wasn't I was in college

4755
02:43:15,000 --> 02:43:17,000
this was about 15 years ago

4756
02:43:17,000 --> 02:43:19,000
it was before I moved out here so yeah about 15 years ago

4757
02:43:19,000 --> 02:43:21,000
so you know video games have actually always

4758
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:23,000
kind of been a little bit expensive

4759
02:43:23,000 --> 02:43:25,000
they dropped a lot when they went to CD

4760
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:27,000
and that was part of the charm about

4761
02:43:27,000 --> 02:43:29,000
why CD gaming was really good

4762
02:43:29,000 --> 02:43:31,000
because they weren't putting all that extra chips

4763
02:43:31,000 --> 02:43:33,000
in cartridge so by the time the PlayStation 1

4764
02:43:33,000 --> 02:43:35,000
PlayStation 2 era came around they actually

4765
02:43:35,000 --> 02:43:37,000
dropped in price quite a bit

4766
02:43:37,000 --> 02:43:39,000
but now they're slowly climbing back up to where they used to be

4767
02:43:39,000 --> 02:43:41,000
not that I'm necessarily saying it's

4768
02:43:41,000 --> 02:43:43,000
justified because you're right there's a lot of

4769
02:43:43,000 --> 02:43:45,000
crap out there for 60 bucks

4770
02:43:45,000 --> 02:43:47,000
that really shouldn't be

4771
02:43:47,000 --> 02:43:49,000
but again what was I saying about

4772
02:43:49,000 --> 02:43:51,000
the marketing people behind video games earlier

4773
02:43:51,000 --> 02:43:53,000
that many of them

4774
02:43:53,000 --> 02:43:55,000
they don't play games oh yeah they don't play the games

4775
02:43:55,000 --> 02:43:57,000
so everything to them

4776
02:43:57,000 --> 02:43:59,000
is gold

4777
02:43:59,000 --> 02:44:01,000
I think that gaming fandom at large

4778
02:44:01,000 --> 02:44:03,000
or at least this is how the corporations

4779
02:44:03,000 --> 02:44:05,000
have kind of treated gaming fandom is that

4780
02:44:05,000 --> 02:44:07,000
they're very fickle

4781
02:44:07,000 --> 02:44:09,000
and they have a very short attention span

4782
02:44:09,000 --> 02:44:11,000
once a game is older than three months

4783
02:44:11,000 --> 02:44:13,000
no one cares

4784
02:44:13,000 --> 02:44:15,000
like remember when I said buy Starcraft 2

4785
02:44:15,000 --> 02:44:17,000
six months after it comes out

4786
02:44:17,000 --> 02:44:19,000
and it's like well no one's

4787
02:44:19,000 --> 02:44:21,000
everyone's going to have moved on by then

4788
02:44:21,000 --> 02:44:23,000
you have to charge your 60 bucks

4789
02:44:23,000 --> 02:44:25,000
because once the game is three months old

4790
02:44:25,000 --> 02:44:27,000
and you've made your money back by then

4791
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:29,000
no one's going to care

4792
02:44:29,000 --> 02:44:31,000
movies are very similar

4793
02:44:31,000 --> 02:44:33,000
if you don't make your box office back in several weeks

4794
02:44:33,000 --> 02:44:35,000
then

4795
02:44:35,000 --> 02:44:37,000
direct to DVD when everyone else buys it and it becomes a cool hit

4796
02:44:37,000 --> 02:44:39,000
yeah

4797
02:44:39,000 --> 02:44:41,000
so I think it has a lot to do with

4798
02:44:41,000 --> 02:44:43,000
the analysts and their margins

4799
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:45,000
of if this game doesn't

4800
02:44:45,000 --> 02:44:47,000
sell this much past

4801
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:49,000
six weeks or whatever

4802
02:44:49,000 --> 02:44:51,000
their benchmark is then

4803
02:44:51,000 --> 02:44:53,000
yeah so they charge you 60 bucks for it

4804
02:44:53,000 --> 02:44:55,000
people who don't play video games are ruining the gaming industry

4805
02:44:55,000 --> 02:44:57,000
alright

4806
02:44:57,000 --> 02:44:59,000
I have one last email

4807
02:44:59,000 --> 02:45:01,000
are you ready?

4808
02:45:01,000 --> 02:45:03,000
yes

4809
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:05,000
um

4810
02:45:05,000 --> 02:45:07,000
yo guys I just recently got hooked on your show

4811
02:45:07,000 --> 02:45:09,000
and I was very sad to not hear your

4812
02:45:09,000 --> 02:45:11,000
angelic lol voices last week

4813
02:45:11,000 --> 02:45:13,000
anyway I'm emailing you

4814
02:45:13,000 --> 02:45:15,000
wondering if you have any good PSP

4815
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:17,000
titles that you could suggest to me and other

4816
02:45:17,000 --> 02:45:19,000
listeners as I am slowly getting tired

4817
02:45:19,000 --> 02:45:21,000
of Monster Hunter 2, Dissidia

4818
02:45:21,000 --> 02:45:23,000
and Fireteam Bravo

4819
02:45:23,000 --> 02:45:25,000
two thirds I guess

4820
02:45:25,000 --> 02:45:27,000
I'll honestly go for

4821
02:45:27,000 --> 02:45:29,000
almost anything aside from sports games

4822
02:45:29,000 --> 02:45:31,000
ew thanks and may the Flying Spaghetti

4823
02:45:31,000 --> 02:45:33,000
Monster bless you pro butcher

4824
02:45:33,000 --> 02:45:35,000
aka somebody

4825
02:45:35,000 --> 02:45:37,000
um

4826
02:45:37,000 --> 02:45:39,000
all hail his noodly

4827
02:45:39,000 --> 02:45:41,000
goodness uh what was I going to say

4828
02:45:41,000 --> 02:45:43,000
da da da da

4829
02:45:43,000 --> 02:45:45,000
if you like Dissidia

4830
02:45:45,000 --> 02:45:47,000
Final Fantasy 1 and 2 remakes are excellent

4831
02:45:47,000 --> 02:45:49,000
on the PSP

4832
02:45:49,000 --> 02:45:51,000
I think Luminous

4833
02:45:51,000 --> 02:45:53,000
the old puzzler and it's sequel

4834
02:45:53,000 --> 02:45:55,000
I think the sequel is good

4835
02:45:55,000 --> 02:45:57,000
some of the best puzzle games they ever put out on the PSP

4836
02:45:57,000 --> 02:45:59,000
almost was like a reason to own the system

4837
02:45:59,000 --> 02:46:01,000
I liked Every Extend Extra

4838
02:46:01,000 --> 02:46:03,000
which was another Mississippi game

4839
02:46:03,000 --> 02:46:05,000
I liked Papa Locross for a good RPG

4840
02:46:05,000 --> 02:46:07,000
Loco Roco is a cutesy game

4841
02:46:07,000 --> 02:46:09,000
if you like cutesy games

4842
02:46:09,000 --> 02:46:11,000
there's you know

4843
02:46:11,000 --> 02:46:13,000
PSP has quite a few little highlights in there

4844
02:46:13,000 --> 02:46:15,000
and a lot of the ports are surprisingly not bad

4845
02:46:15,000 --> 02:46:17,000
like Little Big Planet on PSP

4846
02:46:17,000 --> 02:46:19,000
32nd Game Heroes

4847
02:46:19,000 --> 02:46:21,000
since I was talking about the 3D Dot Game Heroes

4848
02:46:21,000 --> 02:46:23,000
the 32nd or Half Minute Hero

4849
02:46:23,000 --> 02:46:25,000
whatever it's called is pretty good too

4850
02:46:25,000 --> 02:46:27,000
and there's also going to be the new Kingdom Hearts game

4851
02:46:27,000 --> 02:46:29,000
coming out in September

4852
02:46:29,000 --> 02:46:31,000
and the Valkyria Chronicles

4853
02:46:31,000 --> 02:46:33,000
if you like that kind of thing

4854
02:46:33,000 --> 02:46:35,000
also of course

4855
02:46:35,000 --> 02:46:37,000
there was I believe a Persona

4856
02:46:37,000 --> 02:46:39,000
game that just came out

4857
02:46:39,000 --> 02:46:41,000
on PSP

4858
02:46:41,000 --> 02:46:43,000
um

4859
02:46:43,000 --> 02:46:45,000
and there should be more stuff coming out

4860
02:46:45,000 --> 02:46:47,000
in the 4th quarter of course

4861
02:46:47,000 --> 02:46:49,000
if you like music games

4862
02:46:49,000 --> 02:46:51,000
DJ Max is out there

4863
02:46:51,000 --> 02:46:53,000
and I like Rock Band Unplugged

4864
02:46:53,000 --> 02:46:55,000
but not everybody liked that

4865
02:46:55,000 --> 02:46:57,000
but if you like your 2DX type games

4866
02:46:57,000 --> 02:46:59,000
DJ Max is a good alternative

4867
02:46:59,000 --> 02:47:01,000
I think that's it for music games

4868
02:47:01,000 --> 02:47:03,000
Alf in our chat room

4869
02:47:03,000 --> 02:47:05,000
is suggesting

4870
02:47:05,000 --> 02:47:07,000
Hatsune Miku Project Diva

4871
02:47:07,000 --> 02:47:09,000
I forgot about that one

4872
02:47:09,000 --> 02:47:11,000
good call

4873
02:47:11,000 --> 02:47:13,000
some of the PSP collections are really good too

4874
02:47:13,000 --> 02:47:15,000
like the Gradius collection was pretty awesome

4875
02:47:15,000 --> 02:47:17,000
there's some pretty good collections of games

4876
02:47:17,000 --> 02:47:19,000
isn't there like a Mega Man collection on PSP as well?

4877
02:47:19,000 --> 02:47:21,000
it's pretty cool

4878
02:47:21,000 --> 02:47:23,000
but there's Mega Man

4879
02:47:23,000 --> 02:47:25,000
Mega Man X remade

4880
02:47:25,000 --> 02:47:27,000
the 3D

4881
02:47:27,000 --> 02:47:29,000
they also have the powered up Mega Man

4882
02:47:29,000 --> 02:47:31,000
the super deformed Mega Man 1

4883
02:47:31,000 --> 02:47:33,000
alright

4884
02:47:33,000 --> 02:47:35,000
well there you go, is that it for emails?

4885
02:47:35,000 --> 02:47:37,000
I thought there was a last minute

4886
02:47:37,000 --> 02:47:39,000
do you mind if I refresh the inbox?

4887
02:47:39,000 --> 02:47:41,000
it was from you

4888
02:47:41,000 --> 02:47:43,000
you were sending it wrong

4889
02:47:43,000 --> 02:47:45,000
so I'm not checking it

4890
02:47:45,000 --> 02:47:47,000
are you going to read it?

4891
02:47:47,000 --> 02:47:49,000
I think you should read it

4892
02:47:49,000 --> 02:47:51,000
I'm just so upset

4893
02:47:51,000 --> 02:47:53,000
she's taking away my voice everybody

4894
02:47:53,000 --> 02:47:55,000
that does not fit with the show

4895
02:47:55,000 --> 02:47:57,000
I know

4896
02:47:57,000 --> 02:47:59,000
it's a show where every gamer has a voice

4897
02:47:59,000 --> 02:48:01,000
and I am not being heard

4898
02:48:01,000 --> 02:48:03,000
especially since you are a super game analyst

4899
02:48:03,000 --> 02:48:05,000
I know

4900
02:48:05,000 --> 02:48:07,000
I am a video game analyst

4901
02:48:07,000 --> 02:48:11,000
dark sakura just read it and she wants to die

4902
02:48:11,000 --> 02:48:13,000
what's it say dark sakura?

4903
02:48:13,000 --> 02:48:15,000
I hate you all so much

4904
02:48:15,000 --> 02:48:19,000
I want you all to get the hot shotgun bullets to die

4905
02:48:19,000 --> 02:48:21,000
I wrote dan sucks lol

4906
02:48:21,000 --> 02:48:23,000
but I spelled sucks s-u-x

4907
02:48:23,000 --> 02:48:25,000
because I know she loves that

4908
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:27,000
that sounds like proper English to me

4909
02:48:27,000 --> 02:48:29,000
I mean, sucks

4910
02:48:29,000 --> 02:48:31,000
that's how it turns out on my phone when I text people

4911
02:48:31,000 --> 02:48:33,000
I don't know what to say

4912
02:48:33,000 --> 02:48:35,000
I don't know what to say

4913
02:48:35,000 --> 02:48:37,000
I'm on my own when I text people

4914
02:48:37,000 --> 02:48:39,000
alright, ow

4915
02:48:39,000 --> 02:48:41,000
you see this?

4916
02:48:41,000 --> 02:48:43,000
it's mine now

4917
02:48:43,000 --> 02:48:45,000
it's landed in my yard

4918
02:48:45,000 --> 02:48:47,000
what the hell is it, Alan?

4919
02:48:47,000 --> 02:48:49,000
you're sleeping on the couch

4920
02:48:49,000 --> 02:48:51,000
alright

4921
02:48:51,000 --> 02:48:53,000
this is definitely the time of the show

4922
02:48:53,000 --> 02:48:55,000
I approve of Alan, thank you so much

4923
02:48:55,000 --> 02:48:57,000
this is definitely the part of the show where we're going to get angsty

4924
02:48:57,000 --> 02:49:15,000
with a segment we call the FUs of the Week

4925
02:49:15,000 --> 02:49:17,000
FU to my head hurting

4926
02:49:17,000 --> 02:49:21,000
and Rob

4927
02:49:21,000 --> 02:49:23,000
you stink

4928
02:49:23,000 --> 02:49:25,000
you sucks

4929
02:49:25,000 --> 02:49:27,000
um

4930
02:49:27,000 --> 02:49:29,000
I guess FU to lack of sleep

4931
02:49:29,000 --> 02:49:31,000
but you know

4932
02:49:31,000 --> 02:49:33,000
the baby doesn't know better

4933
02:49:33,000 --> 02:49:35,000
he just doesn't know what night and day is yet

4934
02:49:35,000 --> 02:49:37,000
and he also

4935
02:49:37,000 --> 02:49:39,000
had trouble pooping

4936
02:49:39,000 --> 02:49:41,000
hopefully he is past that now

4937
02:49:41,000 --> 02:49:43,000
because I hate trying to make him poop

4938
02:49:43,000 --> 02:49:45,000
it's difficult

4939
02:49:45,000 --> 02:49:47,000
well, it's not difficult

4940
02:49:47,000 --> 02:49:49,000
but it's gotta be embarrassing for him

4941
02:49:49,000 --> 02:49:51,000
but he doesn't know anything yet

4942
02:49:51,000 --> 02:49:53,000
tell Nellie to stop eating onions

4943
02:49:53,000 --> 02:49:55,000
that has nothing to do with him not pooping

4944
02:49:55,000 --> 02:49:57,000
you know, I'm really curious

4945
02:49:57,000 --> 02:49:59,000
if we're going to have a

4946
02:49:59,000 --> 02:50:01,000
are we going to get

4947
02:50:01,000 --> 02:50:03,000
are we going to get poop stories every week on OLR now?

4948
02:50:03,000 --> 02:50:05,000
that would be great

4949
02:50:05,000 --> 02:50:07,000
sure, I can tell you poop stories

4950
02:50:07,000 --> 02:50:09,000
see, because he is constipated

4951
02:50:09,000 --> 02:50:11,000
so he can't go

4952
02:50:11,000 --> 02:50:13,000
you have to take

4953
02:50:13,000 --> 02:50:15,000
so he has to have little

4954
02:50:15,000 --> 02:50:17,000
suppositories

4955
02:50:17,000 --> 02:50:19,000
put up there

4956
02:50:19,000 --> 02:50:21,000
poor guy

4957
02:50:21,000 --> 02:50:23,000
but it triggers him to poop

4958
02:50:23,000 --> 02:50:25,000
and he this morning

4959
02:50:25,000 --> 02:50:27,000
he pooped like 3 times

4960
02:50:27,000 --> 02:50:29,000
congratulations

4961
02:50:29,000 --> 02:50:31,000
it's good for him

4962
02:50:31,000 --> 02:50:33,000
but he still grunts all night long

4963
02:50:33,000 --> 02:50:35,000
and does his kung fu

4964
02:50:35,000 --> 02:50:37,000
that's quite good for having him watch Ninja Warrior

4965
02:50:37,000 --> 02:50:39,000
Alan Jeff and the FUs

4966
02:50:39,000 --> 02:50:41,000
hopefully the don't involve poop

4967
02:50:41,000 --> 02:50:43,000
his first word should be hadalken

4968
02:50:45,000 --> 02:50:47,000
FU to salmonella

4969
02:50:47,000 --> 02:50:49,000
E. coli and other invisible poop

4970
02:50:49,000 --> 02:50:51,000
that hides in your food and makes you sick

4971
02:50:51,000 --> 02:50:53,000
when you go on vacation

4972
02:50:53,000 --> 02:50:55,000
bad eggs?

4973
02:50:55,000 --> 02:50:57,000
bad chicken I think

4974
02:50:57,000 --> 02:50:59,000
maybe it was a bad egg

4975
02:50:59,000 --> 02:51:01,000
alright, my FU of the week goes to the

4976
02:51:01,000 --> 02:51:03,000
casinos in Reno, Nevada

4977
02:51:03,000 --> 02:51:05,000
what came first, the bad chicken or the bad egg?

4978
02:51:05,000 --> 02:51:07,000
my FU goes to the casinos in Reno, Nevada

4979
02:51:07,000 --> 02:51:09,000
for taking a large, undisclosed

4980
02:51:09,000 --> 02:51:11,000
sum of my money away from me this weekend

4981
02:51:11,000 --> 02:51:13,000
it's not supposed to happen

4982
02:51:13,000 --> 02:51:15,000
meanwhile, all my friends are going

4983
02:51:15,000 --> 02:51:17,000
I won $400 playing craps

4984
02:51:17,000 --> 02:51:19,000
how did you do?

4985
02:51:19,000 --> 02:51:21,000
Dynafire

4986
02:51:21,000 --> 02:51:23,000
no, I'm happy for my friends

4987
02:51:23,000 --> 02:51:25,000
but I'm sad for me

4988
02:51:25,000 --> 02:51:27,000
that's what's really important, right?

4989
02:51:27,000 --> 02:51:29,000
just a couple more stories

4990
02:51:29,000 --> 02:51:31,000
for you guys, and then the Skype line

4991
02:51:31,000 --> 02:51:33,000
we're gonna take your phone calls, oh god

4992
02:51:33,000 --> 02:51:35,000
Loki, what do you got for us?

4993
02:51:35,000 --> 02:51:37,000
don't sound too excited there

4994
02:51:37,000 --> 02:51:39,000
so I have some news

4995
02:51:39,000 --> 02:51:41,000
about Super Street Fighter 4

4996
02:51:41,000 --> 02:51:43,000
of course, the arcade version

4997
02:51:43,000 --> 02:51:45,000
has a few empty slots

4998
02:51:45,000 --> 02:51:47,000
available for some new characters

4999
02:51:47,000 --> 02:51:49,000
and that's what they're gonna get

5000
02:51:49,000 --> 02:51:51,000
they're gonna get some new characters

5001
02:51:51,000 --> 02:51:53,000
that are gonna be, I guess, exclusive to the arcade

5002
02:51:53,000 --> 02:51:55,000
at least for right now

5003
02:51:55,000 --> 02:51:57,000
of course

5004
02:51:57,000 --> 02:51:59,000
it doesn't say exactly what characters those

5005
02:51:59,000 --> 02:52:01,000
are gonna be, I guess that is yet to be determined

5006
02:52:01,000 --> 02:52:03,000
but there will be some new characters

5007
02:52:03,000 --> 02:52:05,000
coming

5008
02:52:05,000 --> 02:52:07,000
any characters you'd like to see

5009
02:52:07,000 --> 02:52:09,000
in Super Street Fighter 4 that haven't

5010
02:52:09,000 --> 02:52:11,000
come in yet?

5011
02:52:11,000 --> 02:52:13,000
Alan, I know you're a big fighting game fan

5012
02:52:13,000 --> 02:52:15,000
or any character that didn't make it from its

5013
02:52:15,000 --> 02:52:17,000
I'm assuming they're gonna take more characters from Alpha

5014
02:52:17,000 --> 02:52:19,000
and put them in

5015
02:52:19,000 --> 02:52:21,000
I wouldn't mind

5016
02:52:21,000 --> 02:52:23,000
Rolento

5017
02:52:23,000 --> 02:52:25,000
also, what's her name?

5018
02:52:25,000 --> 02:52:27,000
Alema?

5019
02:52:27,000 --> 02:52:29,000
Elena?

5020
02:52:29,000 --> 02:52:31,000
yeah, Alema's your Warcraft character

5021
02:52:31,000 --> 02:52:33,000
yeah, from the

5022
02:52:33,000 --> 02:52:35,000
kick character from Street Fighter 3

5023
02:52:35,000 --> 02:52:37,000
was awesome, her

5024
02:52:37,000 --> 02:52:39,000
might get to see it, who knows

5025
02:52:39,000 --> 02:52:41,000
Darsakra, I know you're a Capcom

5026
02:52:41,000 --> 02:52:43,000
fan girl too, any

5027
02:52:43,000 --> 02:52:45,000
extra characters for Street Fighter 4?

5028
02:52:45,000 --> 02:52:47,000
that I wanna see?

5029
02:52:47,000 --> 02:52:49,000
well, in that arcade

5030
02:52:49,000 --> 02:52:51,000
version, I would love to have Sakura

5031
02:52:51,000 --> 02:52:53,000
if there was another arcade version

5032
02:52:53,000 --> 02:52:55,000
well, she'd be in there because it's all the regular

5033
02:52:55,000 --> 02:52:57,000
characters I'm saying for an arcade version

5034
02:52:57,000 --> 02:52:59,000
I would want Sakura, and

5035
02:52:59,000 --> 02:53:01,000
other than that, I'd say

5036
02:53:01,000 --> 02:53:03,000
Ibuki

5037
02:53:03,000 --> 02:53:05,000
because I was a big Ibuki player

5038
02:53:05,000 --> 02:53:07,000
or maybe Karin

5039
02:53:07,000 --> 02:53:09,000
alright

5040
02:53:09,000 --> 02:53:11,000
I got one more story for you guys

5041
02:53:11,000 --> 02:53:13,000
I know who would be great

5042
02:53:13,000 --> 02:53:15,000
you know who would be great?

5043
02:53:15,000 --> 02:53:17,000
Rainbow Mika

5044
02:53:17,000 --> 02:53:19,000
she was the funny chick wrestler

5045
02:53:19,000 --> 02:53:21,000
with the heart pasties

5046
02:53:21,000 --> 02:53:23,000
alright

5047
02:53:23,000 --> 02:53:25,000
moving on to another

5048
02:53:25,000 --> 02:53:27,000
talking about a movie

5049
02:53:27,000 --> 02:53:29,000
we probably would have talked more about this last week

5050
02:53:29,000 --> 02:53:31,000
if we actually had a show, but we didn't

5051
02:53:31,000 --> 02:53:33,000
so this is Scott Pilgrim vs. The World

5052
02:53:33,000 --> 02:53:35,000
is making a lot of news, but

5053
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:37,000
sadly for the gamers, not the kind of news you like to hear

5054
02:53:37,000 --> 02:53:39,000
it is not doing well at the box office

5055
02:53:39,000 --> 02:53:41,000
BOMB

5056
02:53:41,000 --> 02:53:43,000
in its first weekend at the box office

5057
02:53:43,000 --> 02:53:45,000
it made 10.6 million dollars

5058
02:53:45,000 --> 02:53:47,000
and while that still is a lot of money

5059
02:53:47,000 --> 02:53:49,000
when you really put it into context

5060
02:53:49,000 --> 02:53:51,000
it kinda sucks, because if you look at

5061
02:53:51,000 --> 02:53:53,000
some of the recent releases that have come out

5062
02:53:53,000 --> 02:53:55,000
and again

5063
02:53:55,000 --> 02:53:57,000
what did it cost to make?

5064
02:53:57,000 --> 02:53:59,000
Scott Pilgrim is, I wanna say 15

5065
02:53:59,000 --> 02:54:01,000
but I don't know for sure

5066
02:54:01,000 --> 02:54:03,000
is that profits?

5067
02:54:03,000 --> 02:54:05,000
no, this is just straight box office tally

5068
02:54:05,000 --> 02:54:07,000
so then it made less than it cost

5069
02:54:07,000 --> 02:54:09,000
I believe

5070
02:54:09,000 --> 02:54:11,000
they're saying that, yes

5071
02:54:11,000 --> 02:54:13,000
but here's the thing too, I should say this

5072
02:54:13,000 --> 02:54:15,000
technically it's not a video game movie

5073
02:54:15,000 --> 02:54:17,000
it's a comic book movie

5074
02:54:17,000 --> 02:54:19,000
but it's still got the whole

5075
02:54:19,000 --> 02:54:21,000
video game tie in

5076
02:54:21,000 --> 02:54:23,000
but this is the really sad part

5077
02:54:23,000 --> 02:54:25,000
is that the movie

5078
02:54:25,000 --> 02:54:27,000
Gamer with Gerard Butler

5079
02:54:27,000 --> 02:54:29,000
made 11.8 million

5080
02:54:29,000 --> 02:54:31,000
it made more money than Scott Pilgrim's first movie

5081
02:54:31,000 --> 02:54:33,000
but that's a generic action movie with Gerard Butler

5082
02:54:33,000 --> 02:54:35,000
I mean this movie didn't

5083
02:54:35,000 --> 02:54:37,000
have a lot of big

5084
02:54:37,000 --> 02:54:39,000
names in it, I mean Michael Cera

5085
02:54:39,000 --> 02:54:41,000
yay, I don't know

5086
02:54:41,000 --> 02:54:43,000
that and people have really

5087
02:54:43,000 --> 02:54:45,000
terrible tastes

5088
02:54:45,000 --> 02:54:47,000
Vampire Sucks

5089
02:54:47,000 --> 02:54:49,000
being number two

5090
02:54:49,000 --> 02:54:51,000
not to say that Expendables

5091
02:54:51,000 --> 02:54:53,000
is a bad movie, but see that's once again a generic

5092
02:54:53,000 --> 02:54:55,000
action movie, I mean if you like action movies

5093
02:54:55,000 --> 02:54:57,000
you go see that, it's gonna be awesome

5094
02:54:57,000 --> 02:54:59,000
whereas this is basically

5095
02:54:59,000 --> 02:55:01,000
some guy that's

5096
02:55:01,000 --> 02:55:03,000
falling in love with a woman and he has to fight

5097
02:55:03,000 --> 02:55:05,000
her exes, I mean that's

5098
02:55:05,000 --> 02:55:07,000
that's like

5099
02:55:07,000 --> 02:55:09,000
that's almost like my super ex-girlfriend

5100
02:55:09,000 --> 02:55:11,000
or something like that

5101
02:55:11,000 --> 02:55:13,000
which is also lousy, but yeah

5102
02:55:13,000 --> 02:55:15,000
I mean that's the kind of vibe

5103
02:55:15,000 --> 02:55:17,000
that sends off, I mean granted it was an awesome

5104
02:55:17,000 --> 02:55:19,000
movie, but not a lot of people

5105
02:55:19,000 --> 02:55:21,000
really get that kind of stuff

5106
02:55:21,000 --> 02:55:23,000
I mean they're not us

5107
02:55:23,000 --> 02:55:25,000
Well for what it's worth, it made more money than The Wizard

5108
02:55:25,000 --> 02:55:27,000
which made 4.2 million this opening weekend back in

5109
02:55:27,000 --> 02:55:29,000
1989, and Alone

5110
02:55:29,000 --> 02:55:31,000
in the Dark, it did better than a new evil movie

5111
02:55:31,000 --> 02:55:33,000
Oh well I hope so

5112
02:55:33,000 --> 02:55:35,000
And Double Dragon with Scott Wolf only made 2.6 million

5113
02:55:35,000 --> 02:55:37,000
dollars this opening weekend, so at least

5114
02:55:37,000 --> 02:55:39,000
it did better than that

5115
02:55:39,000 --> 02:55:41,000
And Scott Wolf does not like people reminding him about

5116
02:55:41,000 --> 02:55:43,000
that movie

5117
02:55:43,000 --> 02:55:45,000
So you really liked Scott Pilgrim right?

5118
02:55:45,000 --> 02:55:47,000
Loki?

5119
02:55:47,000 --> 02:55:49,000
I loved it, I'd go see it again

5120
02:55:49,000 --> 02:55:51,000
I just like the whole vibe of it, there's a lot of

5121
02:55:51,000 --> 02:55:53,000
in-jokes I guess if you're a gamer

5122
02:55:53,000 --> 02:55:55,000
a lot of things and references that you catch

5123
02:55:55,000 --> 02:55:57,000
I like the characters in it, like I said

5124
02:55:57,000 --> 02:55:59,000
one of my favorite characters was Wallace in there

5125
02:55:59,000 --> 02:56:01,000
because he was just cracking all sorts of

5126
02:56:01,000 --> 02:56:03,000
comments and stuff throughout the movie

5127
02:56:03,000 --> 02:56:05,000
But see one of the things that

5128
02:56:05,000 --> 02:56:07,000
bugged me about the movie is that characters

5129
02:56:07,000 --> 02:56:09,000
like him, they just kind of disappear

5130
02:56:09,000 --> 02:56:11,000
there's a lot not resolved

5131
02:56:11,000 --> 02:56:13,000
I feel like they tried to cram too much

5132
02:56:13,000 --> 02:56:15,000
with six comic books into one movie

5133
02:56:15,000 --> 02:56:17,000
but I mean, how else are you going to do it?

5134
02:56:17,000 --> 02:56:19,000
I don't really know how

5135
02:56:19,000 --> 02:56:21,000
They did it with Watchmen and Watchmen worked

5136
02:56:21,000 --> 02:56:23,000
True

5137
02:56:23,000 --> 02:56:25,000
What did you think of the movie, Alan?

5138
02:56:25,000 --> 02:56:27,000
I liked how the

5139
02:56:27,000 --> 02:56:29,000
video game fandom meta stuff

5140
02:56:29,000 --> 02:56:31,000
was put in

5141
02:56:31,000 --> 02:56:33,000
As far as the actual story, I didn't

5142
02:56:33,000 --> 02:56:35,000
care for it, I thought it was kind of creepy

5143
02:56:35,000 --> 02:56:37,000
and sexist

5144
02:56:37,000 --> 02:56:39,000
Because I'm all, I don't know

5145
02:56:39,000 --> 02:56:41,000
I'm too serious about that kind of stuff

5146
02:56:41,000 --> 02:56:43,000
Because you're a lesbian

5147
02:56:43,000 --> 02:56:45,000
They glossed over some of the characters, like the twins for example

5148
02:56:45,000 --> 02:56:47,000
They kind of glossed over who they even were

5149
02:56:47,000 --> 02:56:49,000
We just knew they were twins, she dated them at some point

5150
02:56:49,000 --> 02:56:51,000
and they had a battle

5151
02:56:51,000 --> 02:56:53,000
and that was it

5152
02:56:53,000 --> 02:56:55,000
I don't even know why they were terrible

5153
02:56:55,000 --> 02:56:57,000
Well, I kind of think they should have just cut that scene

5154
02:56:57,000 --> 02:56:59,000
out of the movie and just had her have five exes

5155
02:56:59,000 --> 02:57:01,000
You know what I mean?

5156
02:57:01,000 --> 02:57:03,000
And so they could develop something else

5157
02:57:03,000 --> 02:57:05,000
It just seemed a little strange

5158
02:57:05,000 --> 02:57:07,000
Part of what I really liked about it

5159
02:57:07,000 --> 02:57:09,000
I think I liked it more than Alan did

5160
02:57:09,000 --> 02:57:11,000
Although I did have some problems with it

5161
02:57:11,000 --> 02:57:13,000
including an unlikeable main character

5162
02:57:13,000 --> 02:57:15,000
I thought that

5163
02:57:15,000 --> 02:57:17,000
it was so random in some parts

5164
02:57:17,000 --> 02:57:19,000
that I couldn't help but laugh my ass off

5165
02:57:19,000 --> 02:57:21,000
Vegan police?

5166
02:57:21,000 --> 02:57:23,000
Yes, you're a vegan

5167
02:57:23,000 --> 02:57:25,000
Telekinesis

5168
02:57:25,000 --> 02:57:27,000
I just liked all the

5169
02:57:27,000 --> 02:57:29,000
different random things

5170
02:57:29,000 --> 02:57:31,000
in there, like for example

5171
02:57:31,000 --> 02:57:33,000
At the end where he's complaining

5172
02:57:33,000 --> 02:57:35,000
He's like

5173
02:57:35,000 --> 02:57:37,000
I can't believe he did that

5174
02:57:37,000 --> 02:57:39,000
It took me two hours!

5175
02:57:39,000 --> 02:57:41,000
Two hours to look up all their information

5176
02:57:41,000 --> 02:57:43,000
and contact numbers

5177
02:57:43,000 --> 02:57:45,000
It was funny

5178
02:57:45,000 --> 02:57:47,000
The League of Evil Exes

5179
02:57:47,000 --> 02:57:49,000
See, I thought for sure that he'd become

5180
02:57:49,000 --> 02:57:51,000
part of the League of Evil Exes

5181
02:57:51,000 --> 02:57:53,000
at the end of the movie

5182
02:57:53,000 --> 02:57:55,000
Oh my god, spoiler!

5183
02:57:55,000 --> 02:57:57,000
I said I thought that he would

5184
02:57:57,000 --> 02:57:59,000
Didn't say he actually did

5185
02:57:59,000 --> 02:58:01,000
Alright, anyhow

5186
02:58:01,000 --> 02:58:03,000
It was, um

5187
02:58:03,000 --> 02:58:05,000
It was, it was okay

5188
02:58:05,000 --> 02:58:07,000
No, I'd say I liked it

5189
02:58:07,000 --> 02:58:09,000
I think I liked the direction

5190
02:58:09,000 --> 02:58:11,000
and the ambiance of the movie

5191
02:58:11,000 --> 02:58:13,000
and just the whole, like, you know

5192
02:58:13,000 --> 02:58:15,000
just turning my brain off and enjoying it

5193
02:58:15,000 --> 02:58:17,000
as like a video game, you know

5194
02:58:17,000 --> 02:58:19,000
and I'd see it again, especially because

5195
02:58:19,000 --> 02:58:21,000
Dark Soccer still hasn't seen it

5196
02:58:21,000 --> 02:58:23,000
And seriously, you need to check out the PlayStation Network game

5197
02:58:23,000 --> 02:58:25,000
It is awesome

5198
02:58:25,000 --> 02:58:27,000
I bet it makes a really good

5199
02:58:27,000 --> 02:58:29,000
video game, ironically

5200
02:58:29,000 --> 02:58:31,000
It's an awesome game, and it's by that guy

5201
02:58:31,000 --> 02:58:33,000
who, remember when we were doing

5202
02:58:33,000 --> 02:58:35,000
Marvel vs. games

5203
02:58:35,000 --> 02:58:37,000
or whatever, that you guys voted off

5204
02:58:37,000 --> 02:58:39,000
Oh, how funny

5205
02:58:39,000 --> 02:58:41,000
Because he does really awesome pixel art

5206
02:58:41,000 --> 02:58:43,000
I don't remember his name now

5207
02:58:43,000 --> 02:58:45,000
But yeah, he did the whole game

5208
02:58:45,000 --> 02:58:47,000
River City Ransom-ish

5209
02:58:47,000 --> 02:58:49,000
Well, I love River City Ransom

5210
02:58:49,000 --> 02:58:51,000
I've been playing with the avatar creator

5211
02:58:51,000 --> 02:58:53,000
on the website, though, that's pretty fun

5212
02:58:53,000 --> 02:58:55,000
Yeah, I made a little avatar on there, too

5213
02:58:55,000 --> 02:58:57,000
Ooh, what website?

5214
02:58:57,000 --> 02:58:59,000
It's on the Scott Pilgrim vs. the World website

5215
02:58:59,000 --> 02:59:01,000
Look at her Facebook or my Facebook, it's there

5216
02:59:01,000 --> 02:59:03,000
Alright, let's open up the Skype line

5217
02:59:03,000 --> 02:59:05,000
Take some calls

5218
02:59:05,000 --> 02:59:07,000
1-877-GAME-OLR is our phone number

5219
02:59:07,000 --> 02:59:09,000
or you can give us a call on the Skype line

5220
02:59:09,000 --> 02:59:11,000
Our username on Skype is

5221
02:59:11,000 --> 02:59:13,000
OrangeLoungeRadio, that's all one word

5222
02:59:13,000 --> 02:59:15,000
But as a reminder, if you are gonna call us

5223
02:59:15,000 --> 02:59:17,000
with your computer, please

5224
02:59:17,000 --> 02:59:19,000
call Echo123

5225
02:59:19,000 --> 02:59:21,000
first, and I think in the newer versions of Skype

5226
02:59:21,000 --> 02:59:23,000
they actually say, make a test call

5227
02:59:23,000 --> 02:59:25,000
Do not skip that step, it's very important

5228
02:59:25,000 --> 02:59:27,000
because a lot of our crap calls

5229
02:59:27,000 --> 02:59:29,000
come in because you didn't test your connection

5230
02:59:29,000 --> 02:59:31,000
and then we know

5231
02:59:31,000 --> 02:59:33,000
Or you can always use the trusty old regular

5232
02:59:33,000 --> 02:59:35,000
telephone and you don't have to screw around with that too much

5233
02:59:35,000 --> 02:59:37,000
1-877-GAME-OLR

5234
02:59:37,000 --> 02:59:39,000
Meanwhile, while we wait for some calls

5235
02:59:39,000 --> 02:59:41,000
to come in, are there any last minute stories?

5236
02:59:41,000 --> 02:59:43,000
Yeah, Just Dance 2

5237
02:59:43,000 --> 02:59:45,000
just announced the

5238
02:59:45,000 --> 02:59:47,000
track list for that

5239
02:59:47,000 --> 02:59:49,000
some songs that they have in there that you can

5240
02:59:49,000 --> 02:59:51,000
dance to, I guess

5241
02:59:51,000 --> 02:59:53,000
I'm getting hammered with calls, we better go to the calls

5242
02:59:53,000 --> 02:59:55,000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

5243
02:59:55,000 --> 02:59:57,000
Hello?

5244
02:59:57,000 --> 02:59:59,000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

5245
02:59:59,000 --> 03:00:01,000
It's Kine

5246
03:00:01,000 --> 03:00:03,000
Hi, Kine, how are you?

5247
03:00:03,000 --> 03:00:05,000
What's on your mind, buddy?

5248
03:00:05,000 --> 03:00:07,000
Not too much

5249
03:00:07,000 --> 03:00:09,000
I was calling in about

5250
03:00:09,000 --> 03:00:11,000
the Poof Poof reference

5251
03:00:11,000 --> 03:00:13,000
in Dragon Quest 9

5252
03:00:13,000 --> 03:00:15,000
Yes, please, what about it?

5253
03:00:17,000 --> 03:00:19,000
The reference

5254
03:00:19,000 --> 03:00:21,000
in 3D Dot Game Heroes

5255
03:00:21,000 --> 03:00:23,000
is actually from a previous Dragon Quest

5256
03:00:23,000 --> 03:00:25,000
off of the NES

5257
03:00:25,000 --> 03:00:27,000
Really?

5258
03:00:27,000 --> 03:00:29,000
It was titled Dragon Warriors

5259
03:00:29,000 --> 03:00:31,000
here in the States

5260
03:00:31,000 --> 03:00:33,000
Yeah, and I can't remember which one it was

5261
03:00:33,000 --> 03:00:35,000
but I think it was the first Dragon Warrior

5262
03:00:35,000 --> 03:00:37,000
that came out

5263
03:00:37,000 --> 03:00:39,000
I played it off the last one in the trilogy

5264
03:00:39,000 --> 03:00:41,000
I didn't even catch

5265
03:00:41,000 --> 03:00:43,000
that as being an original

5266
03:00:43,000 --> 03:00:45,000
Dragon Warrior reference, I just thought it was

5267
03:00:45,000 --> 03:00:47,000
funny, because don't they do this whole thing

5268
03:00:47,000 --> 03:00:49,000
where they, like, in 3D Dot Game Heroes

5269
03:00:49,000 --> 03:00:51,000
it's been a couple months since I played it, but don't they do this whole

5270
03:00:51,000 --> 03:00:53,000
like little switcheroo thing where it ends up

5271
03:00:53,000 --> 03:00:55,000
it's her dad giving the

5272
03:00:55,000 --> 03:00:57,000
you know, massage or whatever they play it off

5273
03:00:57,000 --> 03:00:59,000
that's going to get you mad?

5274
03:00:59,000 --> 03:01:01,000
Yeah, and that's why I remember

5275
03:01:01,000 --> 03:01:03,000
what I said, that's also the inside

5276
03:01:03,000 --> 03:01:05,000
joke, there's a lot of Dragon

5277
03:01:05,000 --> 03:01:07,000
Quest and all the references inside

5278
03:01:07,000 --> 03:01:09,000
of that game

5279
03:01:09,000 --> 03:01:11,000
In like the first round, you can go in the back

5280
03:01:11,000 --> 03:01:13,000
and there's a slide and there must be

5281
03:01:13,000 --> 03:01:15,000
humans from Dragon Quest 3

5282
03:01:15,000 --> 03:01:17,000
so

5283
03:01:17,000 --> 03:01:19,000
I thought

5284
03:01:19,000 --> 03:01:21,000
No, I appreciate it, in fact

5285
03:01:21,000 --> 03:01:23,000
it's kind of funny to know that now that

5286
03:01:23,000 --> 03:01:25,000
that actually was from a

5287
03:01:25,000 --> 03:01:27,000
another game, it was kind of another

5288
03:01:27,000 --> 03:01:29,000
little reference and not just something they made up

5289
03:01:29,000 --> 03:01:31,000
but I like that 3D Dot Game Heroes

5290
03:01:31,000 --> 03:01:33,000
man, if you played, especially if you like

5291
03:01:33,000 --> 03:01:35,000
actually grew up with the 8 and 16 bit games

5292
03:01:35,000 --> 03:01:37,000
even if you didn't, if you have an appreciation for them

5293
03:01:37,000 --> 03:01:39,000
but especially if you did like grow up with them

5294
03:01:39,000 --> 03:01:41,000
I think they're just, like

5295
03:01:41,000 --> 03:01:43,000
it's just a hilarious video game because it's made by

5296
03:01:43,000 --> 03:01:45,000
nerds like you and me, clearly

5297
03:01:45,000 --> 03:01:47,000
Yeah, it was

5298
03:01:47,000 --> 03:01:49,000
definitely marked before

5299
03:01:49,000 --> 03:01:51,000
people that grew up, you know

5300
03:01:51,000 --> 03:01:53,000
in the 8 and 16 bit era

5301
03:01:53,000 --> 03:01:55,000
Um

5302
03:01:55,000 --> 03:01:57,000
Oh yeah, that was the other thing

5303
03:01:57,000 --> 03:01:59,000
I demand a

5304
03:01:59,000 --> 03:02:01,000
Commodore 64 episode

5305
03:02:01,000 --> 03:02:03,000
Oh yes, I think I was joking about this

5306
03:02:03,000 --> 03:02:05,000
on the forums, the Commodore 64 episode

5307
03:02:05,000 --> 03:02:07,000
of OLR, well if we end up doing

5308
03:02:07,000 --> 03:02:09,000
this whole marathon thing we're talking about for

5309
03:02:09,000 --> 03:02:11,000
Labor Day, I'm gonna see what we can do about

5310
03:02:11,000 --> 03:02:13,000
bringing some Commodore 64 content into it

5311
03:02:13,000 --> 03:02:15,000
absolutely, maybe I'll make

5312
03:02:15,000 --> 03:02:17,000
the cast sit down and play what would be a

5313
03:02:17,000 --> 03:02:19,000
good old school Commodore 64

5314
03:02:19,000 --> 03:02:21,000
game to make people play, we could actually, we could

5315
03:02:21,000 --> 03:02:23,000
do a Summer Games 2

5316
03:02:23,000 --> 03:02:25,000
Championship and we can all

5317
03:02:25,000 --> 03:02:27,000
play the different

5318
03:02:27,000 --> 03:02:29,000
countries, that would be awesome

5319
03:02:29,000 --> 03:02:31,000
Alright, well Kyan, thank you so much for the call

5320
03:02:31,000 --> 03:02:33,000
and have fun with 3D.GameHeroes

5321
03:02:33,000 --> 03:02:35,000
it's a great value

5322
03:02:35,000 --> 03:02:37,000
Alright, thank you

5323
03:02:37,000 --> 03:02:39,000
Alright, later

5324
03:02:39,000 --> 03:02:41,000
1877 Game OLR, if you'd like to give us a call

5325
03:02:41,000 --> 03:02:43,000
or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio

5326
03:02:43,000 --> 03:02:45,000
Let's go to another call, hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio

5327
03:02:45,000 --> 03:02:47,000
Who's this?

5328
03:02:47,000 --> 03:02:49,000
Hey, this is Butcher

5329
03:02:49,000 --> 03:02:51,000
either on email or DarkKiske

5330
03:02:51,000 --> 03:02:53,000
on Twitter

5331
03:02:53,000 --> 03:02:55,000
Butcher or DarkKiske on Twitter

5332
03:02:55,000 --> 03:02:57,000
What's on your mind?

5333
03:02:57,000 --> 03:02:59,000
I just want to make this quick

5334
03:02:59,000 --> 03:03:01,000
Thank you guys for giving me

5335
03:03:01,000 --> 03:03:03,000
PSP game suggestions earlier

5336
03:03:03,000 --> 03:03:05,000
Oh, this was your email, okay, yes

5337
03:03:05,000 --> 03:03:07,000
And that's about it

5338
03:03:07,000 --> 03:03:09,000
right now, but

5339
03:03:09,000 --> 03:03:11,000
I had something else and it

5340
03:03:11,000 --> 03:03:13,000
completely skipped my mind

5341
03:03:13,000 --> 03:03:15,000
Uh oh, see

5342
03:03:15,000 --> 03:03:17,000
this happens to us a lot when we do live radio

5343
03:03:17,000 --> 03:03:19,000
is that we're actually doing a show and then we forget

5344
03:03:19,000 --> 03:03:21,000
what we wanted to talk about, but that's why we always

5345
03:03:21,000 --> 03:03:23,000
write things down before we

5346
03:03:23,000 --> 03:03:25,000
do the show, but even then it sometimes

5347
03:03:25,000 --> 03:03:27,000
doesn't help us, but okay, so

5348
03:03:27,000 --> 03:03:29,000
you got, you were asking

5349
03:03:29,000 --> 03:03:31,000
for the PSP games?

5350
03:03:31,000 --> 03:03:33,000
Yeah, that was me

5351
03:03:33,000 --> 03:03:35,000
Did any of those sound interesting to you? You think you might actually go out

5352
03:03:35,000 --> 03:03:37,000
and pick any of those up?

5353
03:03:37,000 --> 03:03:39,000
Yeah, once I actually get a job I'm probably going to go out

5354
03:03:39,000 --> 03:03:41,000
and hunt down a few Final Fantasy games

5355
03:03:41,000 --> 03:03:43,000
You know, unfortunately, that is the

5356
03:03:43,000 --> 03:03:45,000
problem a lot of people are having right now in this economy

5357
03:03:45,000 --> 03:03:47,000
is it's just, it's kind of ironic

5358
03:03:47,000 --> 03:03:49,000
because we got that email about the high prices

5359
03:03:49,000 --> 03:03:51,000
of games too, and

5360
03:03:51,000 --> 03:03:53,000
it's just, you know, within this economy

5361
03:03:53,000 --> 03:03:55,000
it's so hard to kind of afford

5362
03:03:55,000 --> 03:03:57,000
a lot of that, and a couple weeks ago here on

5363
03:03:57,000 --> 03:03:59,000
the show, it was about three weeks ago now, we had that gal

5364
03:03:59,000 --> 03:04:01,000
and I'm so sorry, I forgot her name, what was her

5365
03:04:01,000 --> 03:04:03,000
I remember her real name, but she went by something

5366
03:04:03,000 --> 03:04:05,000
else here on the show, the gal who sat here

5367
03:04:05,000 --> 03:04:07,000
the night Loki had the baby

5368
03:04:07,000 --> 03:04:09,000
Oh, Ashley, um

5369
03:04:09,000 --> 03:04:11,000
No, I forgot what her

5370
03:04:11,000 --> 03:04:13,000
Yeah, her online name

5371
03:04:13,000 --> 03:04:15,000
I forgot what her online name was, but Ashley

5372
03:04:15,000 --> 03:04:17,000
Yeah, I knew that, but it's her online name, I couldn't remember

5373
03:04:17,000 --> 03:04:19,000
But she was a big on the budget gamer

5374
03:04:19,000 --> 03:04:21,000
She's going to be back

5375
03:04:21,000 --> 03:04:23,000
Yeah, she likes the cheap games

5376
03:04:23,000 --> 03:04:25,000
You know, there's a difference between cheap

5377
03:04:25,000 --> 03:04:27,000
and piracy, and you know

5378
03:04:27,000 --> 03:04:29,000
there's a lot of worthy cheap games out there

5379
03:04:29,000 --> 03:04:31,000
and free ones, because she said she was a big player

5380
03:04:31,000 --> 03:04:33,000
of what was it, like Runescape?

5381
03:04:33,000 --> 03:04:35,000
Was that the game? And it's like free

5382
03:04:35,000 --> 03:04:37,000
You can play that online

5383
03:04:37,000 --> 03:04:39,000
Alright, well anyway, good luck with the PSP

5384
03:04:39,000 --> 03:04:41,000
and let us know if you do find some good games

5385
03:04:41,000 --> 03:04:43,000
to pass along to the listeners, let us know, alright?

5386
03:04:43,000 --> 03:04:45,000
Yeah, sure thing

5387
03:04:45,000 --> 03:04:47,000
Alright, take care buddy

5388
03:04:47,000 --> 03:04:49,000
Oh yeah, go ahead

5389
03:04:49,000 --> 03:04:51,000
Thanks to you, to you for getting my name wrong

5390
03:04:51,000 --> 03:04:53,000
early on Twitter, it's not

5391
03:04:53,000 --> 03:04:55,000
DarkKisuke, what did you say, Kisuke?

5392
03:04:55,000 --> 03:04:57,000
Yeah

5393
03:04:57,000 --> 03:04:59,000
Anyway, that's it

5394
03:04:59,000 --> 03:05:01,000
Ah, I do my best, at least I read it

5395
03:05:01,000 --> 03:05:03,000
Alright, take care, bye

5396
03:05:03,000 --> 03:05:05,000
Alright, have a good night

5397
03:05:05,000 --> 03:05:07,000
I try my best

5398
03:05:07,000 --> 03:05:09,000
It's not spelled out phonetically

5399
03:05:09,000 --> 03:05:11,000
I'm probably not going to get it

5400
03:05:11,000 --> 03:05:13,000
We're getting a lot of calls tonight, but this is awesome

5401
03:05:13,000 --> 03:05:15,000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

5402
03:05:15,000 --> 03:05:17,000
Hello

5403
03:05:17,000 --> 03:05:19,000
Oh, it's Xenocore

5404
03:05:19,000 --> 03:05:21,000
Hey, how you doing? A little delay there, that's alright

5405
03:05:21,000 --> 03:05:23,000
Hey, no problem man, it's been a long time

5406
03:05:23,000 --> 03:05:25,000
I know it has, how are you doing Xenocore?

5407
03:05:25,000 --> 03:05:27,000
Well, I've moved

5408
03:05:27,000 --> 03:05:29,000
five states, uh

5409
03:05:29,000 --> 03:05:31,000
managed to secure a job after three attempts

5410
03:05:31,000 --> 03:05:33,000
and many layoffs, and now I'm

5411
03:05:33,000 --> 03:05:35,000
working for Dell

5412
03:05:35,000 --> 03:05:37,000
Well congratulations

5413
03:05:37,000 --> 03:05:39,000
Well, doing army support

5414
03:05:39,000 --> 03:05:41,000
Very cool, wait, you moved from where to where?

5415
03:05:41,000 --> 03:05:43,000
You were in what, Virginia before?

5416
03:05:43,000 --> 03:05:45,000
I was in, uh, I was in Sebastian, Florida

5417
03:05:45,000 --> 03:05:47,000
Now I'm in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma

5418
03:05:47,000 --> 03:05:49,000
Oh, wow, okay, that's quite a move

5419
03:05:49,000 --> 03:05:51,000
Going from the east to the midwest

5420
03:05:51,000 --> 03:05:53,000
Wow, alright, well

5421
03:05:53,000 --> 03:05:55,000
How you liking Oklahoma? I've been there

5422
03:05:55,000 --> 03:05:57,000
once, I was 17 years old

5423
03:05:57,000 --> 03:05:59,000
Many years old

5424
03:05:59,000 --> 03:06:01,000
It's pretty much like living on a space colony

5425
03:06:01,000 --> 03:06:03,000
as close as you can imagine

5426
03:06:03,000 --> 03:06:05,000
There's little things to do here and there of everything

5427
03:06:05,000 --> 03:06:07,000
but you try to go outside the perimeter and there's

5428
03:06:07,000 --> 03:06:09,000
nothing but wasteland

5429
03:06:09,000 --> 03:06:11,000
Yeah, it's kind of isolated

5430
03:06:11,000 --> 03:06:13,000
That's pretty much where it's at

5431
03:06:13,000 --> 03:06:15,000
Well, what's on your mind tonight?

5432
03:06:15,000 --> 03:06:17,000
Uh, not much, not much

5433
03:06:17,000 --> 03:06:19,000
I'm actually getting ready to restart my

5434
03:06:19,000 --> 03:06:21,000
show, and I've been writing

5435
03:06:21,000 --> 03:06:23,000
for the Electra Sisterhood magazine

5436
03:06:23,000 --> 03:06:25,000
in the meantime

5437
03:06:25,000 --> 03:06:27,000
I have heard they launched a magazine

5438
03:06:27,000 --> 03:06:29,000
and it's not an e-zine, right?

5439
03:06:29,000 --> 03:06:31,000
It's an actual tangible super magazine, right?

5440
03:06:31,000 --> 03:06:33,000
No, no

5441
03:06:33,000 --> 03:06:35,000
You can get it in either form, they got it in PDF

5442
03:06:35,000 --> 03:06:37,000
as well as print

5443
03:06:37,000 --> 03:06:39,000
Wow, that's good for them, that can't be an easy venture

5444
03:06:39,000 --> 03:06:41,000
for them, so

5445
03:06:41,000 --> 03:06:43,000
I always seem to run into Ninja Sister at trade shows

5446
03:06:43,000 --> 03:06:45,000
and I think she's adorable, I really like her

5447
03:06:45,000 --> 03:06:47,000
She's been on some of the OLR special shows

5448
03:06:47,000 --> 03:06:49,000
She's great

5449
03:06:49,000 --> 03:06:51,000
Yeah, we're pimping everything out on landofesh.com

5450
03:06:51,000 --> 03:06:53,000
now, so

5451
03:06:53,000 --> 03:06:55,000
Oh, very nice, I didn't know there was a whole new website

5452
03:06:55,000 --> 03:06:57,000
We'll go check that out, absolutely

5453
03:06:57,000 --> 03:06:59,000
What kind of articles are you writing over there?

5454
03:06:59,000 --> 03:07:01,000
Well, the last one I did was a review on how

5455
03:07:01,000 --> 03:07:03,000
the marketing departments of all these games seem to

5456
03:07:03,000 --> 03:07:05,000
love to play with the words

5457
03:07:05,000 --> 03:07:07,000
and tell us what game is

5458
03:07:07,000 --> 03:07:09,000
actually not that, like how I got

5459
03:07:09,000 --> 03:07:11,000
pissed off with Demon Souls, I wrote all about it

5460
03:07:11,000 --> 03:07:13,000
in there. Very interesting, because

5461
03:07:13,000 --> 03:07:15,000
we were just talking earlier about

5462
03:07:15,000 --> 03:07:17,000
and I apologize, this might not have been what you

5463
03:07:17,000 --> 03:07:19,000
wanted to call in about, but we were talking a minute ago

5464
03:07:19,000 --> 03:07:21,000
about how it seems like a lot of marketing

5465
03:07:21,000 --> 03:07:23,000
departments don't actually play

5466
03:07:23,000 --> 03:07:25,000
video games at all

5467
03:07:25,000 --> 03:07:27,000
Oh yeah, that's corporate nature

5468
03:07:27,000 --> 03:07:29,000
in general, they'll sell the stuff without even

5469
03:07:29,000 --> 03:07:31,000
getting aware of what the hell they're selling

5470
03:07:31,000 --> 03:07:33,000
Yeah, you think it would be better if they did?

5471
03:07:33,000 --> 03:07:35,000
Eh, not

5472
03:07:35,000 --> 03:07:37,000
really

5473
03:07:37,000 --> 03:07:39,000
Sometimes it's just the mentality

5474
03:07:39,000 --> 03:07:41,000
The guy who can survive doing sales for a living

5475
03:07:41,000 --> 03:07:43,000
really doesn't have a lot of time to even

5476
03:07:43,000 --> 03:07:45,000
play these things, so you know

5477
03:07:45,000 --> 03:07:47,000
I just rope it up to that's the way the

5478
03:07:47,000 --> 03:07:49,000
world is and keep going

5479
03:07:49,000 --> 03:07:51,000
Gotcha. Well, I think I got us

5480
03:07:51,000 --> 03:07:53,000
off on a tangent, but besides your

5481
03:07:53,000 --> 03:07:55,000
work on ESH, what else is going on

5482
03:07:55,000 --> 03:07:57,000
in your world that you might want

5483
03:07:57,000 --> 03:07:59,000
to call in about tonight?

5484
03:07:59,000 --> 03:08:01,000
Not much, not much. I did see

5485
03:08:01,000 --> 03:08:03,000
Scott Pilgrim, but the one

5486
03:08:03,000 --> 03:08:05,000
guy, actually I just recently saw it today and

5487
03:08:05,000 --> 03:08:07,000
was quite happy. I started Facebooking all

5488
03:08:07,000 --> 03:08:09,000
over the place for it, but the one

5489
03:08:09,000 --> 03:08:11,000
thing that surprised me that I haven't

5490
03:08:11,000 --> 03:08:13,000
seen before was the

5491
03:08:13,000 --> 03:08:15,000
voice of reason and the

5492
03:08:15,000 --> 03:08:17,000
guiding light in the entire show

5493
03:08:17,000 --> 03:08:19,000
was Scott's

5494
03:08:19,000 --> 03:08:21,000
roommate, and this is the best

5495
03:08:21,000 --> 03:08:23,000
possible example I've seen of just

5496
03:08:23,000 --> 03:08:25,000
a normal person who just

5497
03:08:25,000 --> 03:08:27,000
happens to like guys too that's

5498
03:08:27,000 --> 03:08:29,000
treated with a little bit more respect

5499
03:08:29,000 --> 03:08:31,000
than I've seen in other mediums

5500
03:08:31,000 --> 03:08:33,000
things getting better lately. I

5501
03:08:33,000 --> 03:08:35,000
kind of agree with that, that was

5502
03:08:35,000 --> 03:08:37,000
it was pretty cool the way that

5503
03:08:37,000 --> 03:08:39,000
it was just like the cool

5504
03:08:39,000 --> 03:08:41,000
gay friend and that's just the way it was, but I think it

5505
03:08:41,000 --> 03:08:43,000
also shows like I kind of go

5506
03:08:43,000 --> 03:08:45,000
back to the original comics and from

5507
03:08:45,000 --> 03:08:47,000
what I've read on the original comics is that

5508
03:08:47,000 --> 03:08:49,000
that character was inspired by a real

5509
03:08:49,000 --> 03:08:51,000
life interaction that the

5510
03:08:51,000 --> 03:08:53,000
author of the comics had with a former

5511
03:08:53,000 --> 03:08:55,000
roommate of his. I think it just kind of goes

5512
03:08:55,000 --> 03:08:57,000
to show that the younger generation

5513
03:08:57,000 --> 03:08:59,000
especially, you know, and when I say that

5514
03:08:59,000 --> 03:09:01,000
God I make myself sound so old, but just

5515
03:09:01,000 --> 03:09:03,000
even folks that are like 10-15 years younger

5516
03:09:03,000 --> 03:09:05,000
than us, like it's just not even an

5517
03:09:05,000 --> 03:09:07,000
issue anymore. And if you look at the people who

5518
03:09:07,000 --> 03:09:09,000
do have an issue with

5519
03:09:09,000 --> 03:09:11,000
you know, same sex

5520
03:09:11,000 --> 03:09:13,000
relations and what have you, it's almost always

5521
03:09:13,000 --> 03:09:15,000
old fuddy duddies

5522
03:09:15,000 --> 03:09:17,000
you know, like that

5523
03:09:17,000 --> 03:09:19,000
I don't know why they're so threatened, but

5524
03:09:19,000 --> 03:09:21,000
it's just comforting to know that you know

5525
03:09:21,000 --> 03:09:23,000
especially a lot of the folks that listen to this show

5526
03:09:23,000 --> 03:09:25,000
it's just whatever

5527
03:09:25,000 --> 03:09:27,000
you know, it's just not even a big deal

5528
03:09:27,000 --> 03:09:29,000
you know, so I think it's great

5529
03:09:29,000 --> 03:09:31,000
cause that's the way it should be, it's just people like

5530
03:09:31,000 --> 03:09:33,000
who they like, I don't even think

5531
03:09:33,000 --> 03:09:35,000
you should have to be gay or

5532
03:09:35,000 --> 03:09:37,000
straight, just be

5533
03:09:37,000 --> 03:09:39,000
nice

5534
03:09:39,000 --> 03:09:41,000
Exactly, exactly

5535
03:09:41,000 --> 03:09:43,000
All we need

5536
03:09:43,000 --> 03:09:45,000
And I have one gaming accomplishment I gotta share

5537
03:09:45,000 --> 03:09:47,000
before I go, I managed

5538
03:09:47,000 --> 03:09:49,000
to find a working

5539
03:09:49,000 --> 03:09:51,000
version of Escape

5540
03:09:51,000 --> 03:09:53,000
from the Planet of Robot Monsters

5541
03:09:53,000 --> 03:09:55,000
and I got to the last dude and lost all the

5542
03:09:55,000 --> 03:09:57,000
rest of my credits there, it was epic, I loved it

5543
03:09:59,000 --> 03:10:01,000
How long did it take you to do that?

5544
03:10:01,000 --> 03:10:03,000
It took me about a good hour

5545
03:10:03,000 --> 03:10:05,000
but that game was

5546
03:10:05,000 --> 03:10:07,000
jimmied so that way we could still use credits

5547
03:10:07,000 --> 03:10:09,000
they took off the continue

5548
03:10:09,000 --> 03:10:11,000
limitation and everything, I actually got pretty

5549
03:10:11,000 --> 03:10:13,000
decent at it, but that game is brutal

5550
03:10:13,000 --> 03:10:15,000
it's as brutal as it should and half these games

5551
03:10:15,000 --> 03:10:17,000
that can only be played through MAME

5552
03:10:17,000 --> 03:10:19,000
right now, they need to be re-released

5553
03:10:19,000 --> 03:10:21,000
like whether on PSN or Xbox

5554
03:10:21,000 --> 03:10:23,000
Live or whatever, at least the newer ones from like the

5555
03:10:23,000 --> 03:10:25,000
late 90's and such

5556
03:10:25,000 --> 03:10:27,000
but that's all I got

5557
03:10:27,000 --> 03:10:29,000
keep gaming alive, excellent job guys

5558
03:10:29,000 --> 03:10:31,000
I'll talk to you in the future

5559
03:10:31,000 --> 03:10:33,000
Thank you so much for the phone call, I appreciate it buddy

5560
03:10:33,000 --> 03:10:35,000
Have a good one

5561
03:10:35,000 --> 03:10:37,000
Later, you too, bye bye

5562
03:10:37,000 --> 03:10:39,000
We can take some more calls

5563
03:10:39,000 --> 03:10:41,000
877-GAME-OLR

5564
03:10:41,000 --> 03:10:43,000
or our username on Skype is orangeloungeradio

5565
03:10:45,000 --> 03:10:47,000
and we'll

5566
03:10:47,000 --> 03:10:49,000
take some more calls, looks like things finally

5567
03:10:49,000 --> 03:10:51,000
slowed up here for a minute, we can get back to the

5568
03:10:51,000 --> 03:10:53,000
Dance 2 story if you want

5569
03:10:53,000 --> 03:10:55,000
Some of the songs in there, including some of the

5570
03:10:55,000 --> 03:10:57,000
really annoying songs, they've

5571
03:10:57,000 --> 03:10:59,000
got

5572
03:10:59,000 --> 03:11:01,000
let's see here, Kesha

5573
03:11:01,000 --> 03:11:03,000
with TikTok

5574
03:11:03,000 --> 03:11:05,000
OutKast with

5575
03:11:05,000 --> 03:11:07,000
I was just thinking there's not enough gutter

5576
03:11:07,000 --> 03:11:09,000
trash on the Wii

5577
03:11:09,000 --> 03:11:11,000
The Pussycat Dolls

5578
03:11:11,000 --> 03:11:13,000
When I Grow Up

5579
03:11:15,000 --> 03:11:17,000
I don't recognize a lot

5580
03:11:17,000 --> 03:11:19,000
of these songs

5581
03:11:19,000 --> 03:11:21,000
Avril Lavigne, Girlfriend

5582
03:11:23,000 --> 03:11:25,000
Let's see here

5583
03:11:25,000 --> 03:11:27,000
Bonnie M. Rasputin

5584
03:11:29,000 --> 03:11:31,000
Cher the Shoop Shoop song

5585
03:11:31,000 --> 03:11:33,000
Donna Summer's

5586
03:11:33,000 --> 03:11:35,000
Hot Stuff

5587
03:11:37,000 --> 03:11:39,000
This game sounds more and more like a 70's

5588
03:11:39,000 --> 03:11:41,000
disco with each song that you read

5589
03:11:41,000 --> 03:11:43,000
Ike and Tina Turner, Proud Mary

5590
03:11:43,000 --> 03:11:45,000
Wow, alright look

5591
03:11:45,000 --> 03:11:47,000
we're gonna go to a phone call to save this

5592
03:11:47,000 --> 03:11:49,000
We also have Justice with D.A.N.C.E

5593
03:11:49,000 --> 03:11:51,000
and that song is awesome

5594
03:11:51,000 --> 03:11:53,000
Hi you're on Orange Lawn's Radio, who's this?

5595
03:11:53,000 --> 03:11:55,000
Hey it's Ron, how's everyone doing tonight?

5596
03:11:55,000 --> 03:11:57,000
I am great, how are you?

5597
03:11:57,000 --> 03:11:59,000
I'm good

5598
03:11:59,000 --> 03:12:01,000
Before we get to you Loki

5599
03:12:01,000 --> 03:12:03,000
congratulations

5600
03:12:03,000 --> 03:12:05,000
Thank you

5601
03:12:05,000 --> 03:12:07,000
You're welcome

5602
03:12:07,000 --> 03:12:09,000
I saw Scott Pilgrim vs.

5603
03:12:09,000 --> 03:12:11,000
the World on Saturday

5604
03:12:11,000 --> 03:12:13,000
I enjoyed the movie but

5605
03:12:13,000 --> 03:12:15,000
the only issue

5606
03:12:15,000 --> 03:12:17,000
that I had

5607
03:12:17,000 --> 03:12:19,000
maybe because it's my

5608
03:12:19,000 --> 03:12:21,000
ginormous ego and my portrayal

5609
03:12:21,000 --> 03:12:23,000
and my odd views of the world

5610
03:12:23,000 --> 03:12:25,000
I just didn't like how

5611
03:12:25,000 --> 03:12:27,000
Scott Pilgrim was portrayed

5612
03:12:27,000 --> 03:12:29,000
as this socially inept

5613
03:12:29,000 --> 03:12:31,000
awkward geek

5614
03:12:31,000 --> 03:12:33,000
maybe it's because of the people that

5615
03:12:33,000 --> 03:12:35,000
I've run with throughout the years

5616
03:12:35,000 --> 03:12:37,000
I've never come across anybody

5617
03:12:37,000 --> 03:12:39,000
as bad as him

5618
03:12:39,000 --> 03:12:41,000
I can see that

5619
03:12:41,000 --> 03:12:43,000
Yeah

5620
03:12:43,000 --> 03:12:45,000
Yeah

5621
03:12:45,000 --> 03:12:47,000
To me

5622
03:12:47,000 --> 03:12:49,000
Isn't that kind of what Michael Cera is

5623
03:12:49,000 --> 03:12:51,000
in every movie he's in?

5624
03:12:51,000 --> 03:12:53,000
and Arrested Development to some extent

5625
03:12:53,000 --> 03:12:55,000
Michael Cera needs a shot

5626
03:12:55,000 --> 03:12:57,000
Jesse Hinesburg should have been in that movie

5627
03:12:57,000 --> 03:12:59,000
He was the kid from

5628
03:12:59,000 --> 03:13:01,000
Zombie Land

5629
03:13:03,000 --> 03:13:05,000
Yeah I know

5630
03:13:05,000 --> 03:13:07,000
What's funny is people think

5631
03:13:07,000 --> 03:13:09,000
that Michael Cera was in Zombieland

5632
03:13:09,000 --> 03:13:11,000
because they keep mistaking both guys

5633
03:13:11,000 --> 03:13:13,000
I'm like no that's two separate people

5634
03:13:13,000 --> 03:13:15,000
Hehehe

5635
03:13:15,000 --> 03:13:17,000
But did you like

5636
03:13:17,000 --> 03:13:19,000
otherwise besides the whole

5637
03:13:19,000 --> 03:13:21,000
main character which is funny enough

5638
03:13:21,000 --> 03:13:23,000
was one of the big problems I had with the movie

5639
03:13:23,000 --> 03:13:25,000
did you kind of like everything else about it?

5640
03:13:25,000 --> 03:13:27,000
Yeah I did

5641
03:13:27,000 --> 03:13:29,000
I even had to convince my best friend

5642
03:13:29,000 --> 03:13:31,000
to watch the movie

5643
03:13:31,000 --> 03:13:33,000
so maybe her view will be a little bit different

5644
03:13:33,000 --> 03:13:35,000
if she watches it

5645
03:13:35,000 --> 03:13:37,000
Yeah

5646
03:13:37,000 --> 03:13:39,000
It's kind of a bummer

5647
03:13:39,000 --> 03:13:41,000
that it's doing so terribly at the box office

5648
03:13:41,000 --> 03:13:43,000
because you know

5649
03:13:43,000 --> 03:13:45,000
I feel like people will never try to do

5650
03:13:45,000 --> 03:13:47,000
another movie like it

5651
03:13:47,000 --> 03:13:49,000
Why do you think the movie is bombing so terribly?

5652
03:13:49,000 --> 03:13:51,000
Simply put

5653
03:13:51,000 --> 03:13:53,000
it went up against The Expendables

5654
03:13:53,000 --> 03:13:55,000
and Julia Roberts

5655
03:13:55,000 --> 03:13:57,000
That's the only reason why it tanked out

5656
03:13:57,000 --> 03:13:59,000
Now if it went up

5657
03:13:59,000 --> 03:14:01,000
if it was out during an off season

5658
03:14:01,000 --> 03:14:03,000
it would have done good

5659
03:14:03,000 --> 03:14:05,000
because personally when I saw the poster

5660
03:14:05,000 --> 03:14:07,000
I'm like hmm maybe

5661
03:14:07,000 --> 03:14:09,000
I'm like okay I'll go see this

5662
03:14:09,000 --> 03:14:11,000
then The Expendables happens to show up

5663
03:14:11,000 --> 03:14:13,000
I'm like this is my 80's childhood right here

5664
03:14:13,000 --> 03:14:15,000
80's childhood

5665
03:14:15,000 --> 03:14:17,000
versus

5666
03:14:17,000 --> 03:14:19,000
geekdom geek fandom versus 80's childhood

5667
03:14:19,000 --> 03:14:21,000
Yeah exactly

5668
03:14:21,000 --> 03:14:23,000
and I'm asking people

5669
03:14:23,000 --> 03:14:25,000
give me faith in the movie

5670
03:14:25,000 --> 03:14:27,000
don't give me reasons to see it

5671
03:14:27,000 --> 03:14:29,000
just give me faith in it

5672
03:14:29,000 --> 03:14:31,000
unfortunately there was no faith

5673
03:14:31,000 --> 03:14:33,000
For me with The Expendables

5674
03:14:33,000 --> 03:14:35,000
it's like wow everything I don't

5675
03:14:35,000 --> 03:14:37,000
like about 80's movies in one movie

5676
03:14:37,000 --> 03:14:39,000
I'm like there's the perfect movie for me to

5677
03:14:39,000 --> 03:14:41,000
not see

5678
03:14:41,000 --> 03:14:43,000
At least that's

5679
03:14:43,000 --> 03:14:45,000
how I felt about it but you know

5680
03:14:45,000 --> 03:14:47,000
Well

5681
03:14:47,000 --> 03:14:49,000
at least I'm happy that

5682
03:14:49,000 --> 03:14:51,000
the movie is getting a sequel but you know that's just me

5683
03:14:51,000 --> 03:14:53,000
Alright

5684
03:14:53,000 --> 03:14:55,000
Alright

5685
03:14:55,000 --> 03:14:57,000
anything else you want to share with the

5686
03:14:57,000 --> 03:14:59,000
listeners tonight?

5687
03:14:59,000 --> 03:15:01,000
I picked up another DJ Hero

5688
03:15:01,000 --> 03:15:03,000
turntable controller for 20 bucks

5689
03:15:03,000 --> 03:15:05,000
and I'm looking forward to DJ Hero 2

5690
03:15:07,000 --> 03:15:09,000
Yeah now's a good time to get a

5691
03:15:09,000 --> 03:15:11,000
turntable controller if you have any interest in DJ Hero 2

5692
03:15:11,000 --> 03:15:13,000
because you could probably get the turntable by itself

5693
03:15:13,000 --> 03:15:15,000
and then DJ Hero 2 by itself

5694
03:15:15,000 --> 03:15:17,000
for much cheaper

5695
03:15:17,000 --> 03:15:19,000
than the combo

5696
03:15:19,000 --> 03:15:21,000
Maybe because I think it was only on sale

5697
03:15:21,000 --> 03:15:23,000
with Best Buy and Kmart

5698
03:15:23,000 --> 03:15:25,000
for like two weeks only

5699
03:15:25,000 --> 03:15:27,000
and now I've been checking prices

5700
03:15:27,000 --> 03:15:29,000
it's back at the regular price and my turntable

5701
03:15:29,000 --> 03:15:31,000
control was on back order for about a week and a half

5702
03:15:31,000 --> 03:15:33,000
Tekken 6 is on sale for 10 bucks

5703
03:15:33,000 --> 03:15:35,000
at Best Buy

5704
03:15:35,000 --> 03:15:37,000
Much better than 60

5705
03:15:37,000 --> 03:15:39,000
If you have the $28 coupon card

5706
03:15:39,000 --> 03:15:41,000
which you can print out

5707
03:15:41,000 --> 03:15:43,000
Alright Rob we're going to let you go so we can

5708
03:15:43,000 --> 03:15:45,000
try and get at least one more call in here before we sign off

5709
03:15:45,000 --> 03:15:47,000
for the night but thanks so much for your call okay buddy?

5710
03:15:47,000 --> 03:15:49,000
Not the problem Luigi

5711
03:15:49,000 --> 03:15:51,000
out here

5712
03:15:51,000 --> 03:15:53,000
Alright bye take care

5713
03:15:53,000 --> 03:15:55,000
Let's see one more call here

5714
03:15:55,000 --> 03:15:57,000
I'm going to try to get to tonight. Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio

5715
03:15:57,000 --> 03:15:59,000
who's this?

5716
03:15:59,000 --> 03:16:01,000
DJ Blaziken

5717
03:16:01,000 --> 03:16:03,000
DJ Blaziken what is on your mind?

5718
03:16:03,000 --> 03:16:05,000
Not much

5719
03:16:05,000 --> 03:16:07,000
other than some possible new game

5720
03:16:07,000 --> 03:16:09,000
for Butcher to pick up when he gets in cash

5721
03:16:09,000 --> 03:16:11,000
Actually

5722
03:16:11,000 --> 03:16:13,000
these games went down to like

5723
03:16:13,000 --> 03:16:15,000
10 bucks

5724
03:16:15,000 --> 03:16:17,000
and they are

5725
03:16:17,000 --> 03:16:19,000
Twisted Metal

5726
03:16:19,000 --> 03:16:21,000
I think

5727
03:16:21,000 --> 03:16:23,000
they even dropped

5728
03:16:23,000 --> 03:16:25,000
I think it's

5729
03:16:25,000 --> 03:16:27,000
I think it's

5730
03:16:27,000 --> 03:16:29,000
It was Quiz World for $7.99

5731
03:16:29,000 --> 03:16:31,000
on PSN

5732
03:16:31,000 --> 03:16:33,000
and then

5733
03:16:33,000 --> 03:16:35,000
oh yeah

5734
03:16:35,000 --> 03:16:37,000
Beats

5735
03:16:37,000 --> 03:16:39,000
which I also have a

5736
03:16:39,000 --> 03:16:41,000
review for

5737
03:16:41,000 --> 03:16:43,000
which it's kind of like

5738
03:16:43,000 --> 03:16:45,000
if you were to take

5739
03:16:45,000 --> 03:16:47,000
oh

5740
03:16:47,000 --> 03:16:49,000
Beatmania and just have three lines

5741
03:16:51,000 --> 03:16:53,000
that's what Beats is but the cool thing is

5742
03:16:53,000 --> 03:16:55,000
it's kind of like Stepmania

5743
03:16:55,000 --> 03:16:57,000
or ITG

5744
03:16:57,000 --> 03:16:59,000
where you can use your own music and

5745
03:16:59,000 --> 03:17:01,000
it goes off your memory card

5746
03:17:01,000 --> 03:17:03,000
like your whole music library

5747
03:17:03,000 --> 03:17:05,000
that you got on there

5748
03:17:05,000 --> 03:17:07,000
A lot of those games that make their own music

5749
03:17:07,000 --> 03:17:09,000
and I reviewed one here on the show just like I think

5750
03:17:09,000 --> 03:17:11,000
a couple weeks ago we were last on the air

5751
03:17:11,000 --> 03:17:13,000
there's that game that was on Steam like

5752
03:17:13,000 --> 03:17:15,000
Rhythm Zone or something like that that uses your own

5753
03:17:15,000 --> 03:17:17,000
MP3's and it's

5754
03:17:17,000 --> 03:17:19,000
Bootsy to use a word that Irene uses a lot

5755
03:17:19,000 --> 03:17:21,000
it's a Bootsy game because like

5756
03:17:21,000 --> 03:17:23,000
the note patterns that come up with the music you make

5757
03:17:23,000 --> 03:17:25,000
are just not interesting

5758
03:17:25,000 --> 03:17:27,000
yet a game like Audio Surf

5759
03:17:27,000 --> 03:17:29,000
I think is actually a lot better

5760
03:17:29,000 --> 03:17:31,000
and it makes its own patterns too

5761
03:17:31,000 --> 03:17:33,000
based on the MP3's you're playing but you're not

5762
03:17:33,000 --> 03:17:35,000
hitting buttons at random

5763
03:17:35,000 --> 03:17:37,000
like flailing on your keyboard in time

5764
03:17:37,000 --> 03:17:39,000
to the music. Audio Surf the game

5765
03:17:39,000 --> 03:17:41,000
is kind of different it's like a puzzle game mixed

5766
03:17:41,000 --> 03:17:43,000
with music mixed with action

5767
03:17:43,000 --> 03:17:45,000
I don't know it's different so it works for me

5768
03:17:45,000 --> 03:17:47,000
but I mean is this other game

5769
03:17:47,000 --> 03:17:49,000
you're talking about button flailing or what?

5770
03:17:49,000 --> 03:17:51,000
Okay

5771
03:17:51,000 --> 03:17:53,000
actually but this one though

5772
03:17:53,000 --> 03:17:55,000
it uses all four

5773
03:17:55,000 --> 03:17:57,000
the extra circle square buttons on your PSP

5774
03:17:57,000 --> 03:17:59,000
and

5775
03:17:59,000 --> 03:18:01,000
but the cool thing is

5776
03:18:01,000 --> 03:18:03,000
well here's the only jip of it

5777
03:18:03,000 --> 03:18:05,000
I tried to play along with some of my

5778
03:18:05,000 --> 03:18:07,000
DDR soundtrack songs

5779
03:18:07,000 --> 03:18:09,000
it won't work with them. It doesn't work with

5780
03:18:09,000 --> 03:18:11,000
anything under

5781
03:18:11,000 --> 03:18:13,000
two or three minutes

5782
03:18:13,000 --> 03:18:15,000
Oh that's weird

5783
03:18:15,000 --> 03:18:17,000
so I hate to say it for all you

5784
03:18:17,000 --> 03:18:19,000
B-Money fans who wanted to use your

5785
03:18:19,000 --> 03:18:21,000
B-Money soundtracks

5786
03:18:21,000 --> 03:18:23,000
for beats you're out of luck

5787
03:18:23,000 --> 03:18:25,000
That is kind of weird that it

5788
03:18:25,000 --> 03:18:27,000
won't work for such short songs

5789
03:18:27,000 --> 03:18:29,000
I wonder if that has to do with some type of like scoring

5790
03:18:29,000 --> 03:18:31,000
algorithm or

5791
03:18:31,000 --> 03:18:33,000
I can't even think of achievements

5792
03:18:33,000 --> 03:18:35,000
It's a scoring system but yet it'll work

5793
03:18:35,000 --> 03:18:37,000
with stuff like

5794
03:18:37,000 --> 03:18:39,000
the Initial V soundtrack

5795
03:18:39,000 --> 03:18:41,000
which I have

5796
03:18:41,000 --> 03:18:43,000
and like the only

5797
03:18:43,000 --> 03:18:45,000
B-Money song I have on there from

5798
03:18:45,000 --> 03:18:47,000
that which

5799
03:18:47,000 --> 03:18:49,000
I think everyone knows Night of Fire

5800
03:18:49,000 --> 03:18:51,000
of course

5801
03:18:51,000 --> 03:18:53,000
you know and

5802
03:18:53,000 --> 03:18:55,000
a lot of the old DDR songs

5803
03:18:55,000 --> 03:18:57,000
and I mean old old old DDR songs

5804
03:18:57,000 --> 03:18:59,000
came from a series in Japan

5805
03:18:59,000 --> 03:19:01,000
called Dance Mania X not to be

5806
03:19:01,000 --> 03:19:03,000
confused with Dance Maniacs

5807
03:19:03,000 --> 03:19:05,000
or just the Dance Mania albums

5808
03:19:05,000 --> 03:19:07,000
and if you can go to those albums

5809
03:19:07,000 --> 03:19:09,000
you can find a lot of longer

5810
03:19:09,000 --> 03:19:11,000
versions of old school B-Money songs

5811
03:19:11,000 --> 03:19:13,000
because they were all trimmed down from

5812
03:19:13,000 --> 03:19:15,000
CD cuts that were three or four minutes

5813
03:19:15,000 --> 03:19:17,000
long

5814
03:19:17,000 --> 03:19:19,000
Wow I had no clue

5815
03:19:19,000 --> 03:19:21,000
of that. There you go you learn something

5816
03:19:21,000 --> 03:19:23,000
new every day. Alright

5817
03:19:23,000 --> 03:19:25,000
Yeah Dance Maniacs

5818
03:19:25,000 --> 03:19:27,000
I do have one

5819
03:19:27,000 --> 03:19:29,000
and so

5820
03:19:29,000 --> 03:19:31,000
basically I was just

5821
03:19:31,000 --> 03:19:33,000
wondering what the heck else

5822
03:19:33,000 --> 03:19:35,000
you know oh yeah

5823
03:19:35,000 --> 03:19:37,000
even though it's import only

5824
03:19:37,000 --> 03:19:39,000
but I say it's worth it

5825
03:19:39,000 --> 03:19:41,000
if you love racing games

5826
03:19:41,000 --> 03:19:43,000
a lot of stuff like Ridge Racer might be starting to get tired

5827
03:19:43,000 --> 03:19:45,000
of it but also loves anime

5828
03:19:45,000 --> 03:19:47,000
Initial D

5829
03:19:47,000 --> 03:19:49,000
Street Stage

5830
03:19:49,000 --> 03:19:51,000
with

5831
03:19:51,000 --> 03:19:53,000
PSP

5832
03:19:53,000 --> 03:19:55,000
which

5833
03:19:55,000 --> 03:19:57,000
I don't know where else to get that because

5834
03:19:57,000 --> 03:19:59,000
nowhere

5835
03:19:59,000 --> 03:20:01,000
sells it here in America

5836
03:20:01,000 --> 03:20:03,000
Well if it's not something

5837
03:20:03,000 --> 03:20:05,000
you can get on the Playstation

5838
03:20:05,000 --> 03:20:07,000
store you have to

5839
03:20:07,000 --> 03:20:09,000
kind of go the harder routes of trying to find

5840
03:20:09,000 --> 03:20:11,000
Fish Up a Copy on eBay or Amazon

5841
03:20:11,000 --> 03:20:13,000
or one of those but they're you know

5842
03:20:13,000 --> 03:20:15,000
the internet really

5843
03:20:15,000 --> 03:20:17,000
so

5844
03:20:17,000 --> 03:20:19,000
Alright well anything else on your mind buddy before we let you

5845
03:20:19,000 --> 03:20:21,000
go

5846
03:20:21,000 --> 03:20:23,000
Hey I got a little question

5847
03:20:23,000 --> 03:20:25,000
for you on the fact

5848
03:20:25,000 --> 03:20:27,000
you're like I saw

5849
03:20:27,000 --> 03:20:29,000
something that was back on the old

5850
03:20:29,000 --> 03:20:31,000
games and it said a little thing on your profile like

5851
03:20:31,000 --> 03:20:33,000
you had some previous college and high school

5852
03:20:33,000 --> 03:20:35,000
broadcasting experience

5853
03:20:35,000 --> 03:20:37,000
and I got asked this too

5854
03:20:37,000 --> 03:20:39,000
what got you interested in broadcasting

5855
03:20:39,000 --> 03:20:41,000
That's a really good

5856
03:20:41,000 --> 03:20:43,000
question

5857
03:20:43,000 --> 03:20:45,000
That's because Rob

5858
03:20:45,000 --> 03:20:47,000
is a big attention whore

5859
03:20:47,000 --> 03:20:49,000
Partially that

5860
03:20:49,000 --> 03:20:51,000
Here's the thing when I was in college

5861
03:20:51,000 --> 03:20:53,000
No I know but no part of it is I'm

5862
03:20:53,000 --> 03:20:55,000
an attention whore I do I like the

5863
03:20:55,000 --> 03:20:57,000
getting the like for instance last night

5864
03:20:57,000 --> 03:20:59,000
at the Rocky thing that I was doing

5865
03:20:59,000 --> 03:21:01,000
I got to lead you know four thousand

5866
03:21:01,000 --> 03:21:03,000
some odd give or take a few thousand

5867
03:21:03,000 --> 03:21:05,000
in doing the time warp and that felt

5868
03:21:05,000 --> 03:21:07,000
awesome like just you know like all the

5869
03:21:07,000 --> 03:21:09,000
people doing you know what I'm telling them to do

5870
03:21:09,000 --> 03:21:11,000
is just kind of cool like you know

5871
03:21:11,000 --> 03:21:13,000
it was cool but to be honest

5872
03:21:13,000 --> 03:21:15,000
where that all comes from I got into

5873
03:21:15,000 --> 03:21:17,000
radio in college because I actually originally

5874
03:21:17,000 --> 03:21:19,000
originally originally was studying

5875
03:21:19,000 --> 03:21:21,000
to do computer science because you know I'm a nerd

5876
03:21:21,000 --> 03:21:23,000
I thought I'd like computers but for me

5877
03:21:23,000 --> 03:21:25,000
wasn't for me I didn't like it it's for other

5878
03:21:25,000 --> 03:21:27,000
people but not for me I actually had a really bad

5879
03:21:27,000 --> 03:21:29,000
professor that I think kind of just turned me off of the whole

5880
03:21:29,000 --> 03:21:31,000
thing but I switched

5881
03:21:31,000 --> 03:21:33,000
to studying television I was

5882
03:21:33,000 --> 03:21:35,000
actually wanting to be for a little bit I wanted to be a weather

5883
03:21:35,000 --> 03:21:37,000
man and then I was going to be a broadcast

5884
03:21:37,000 --> 03:21:39,000
journalist and I actually interned for a little while

5885
03:21:39,000 --> 03:21:41,000
at a CBS station up where I went to school

5886
03:21:41,000 --> 03:21:43,000
but I found that the

5887
03:21:43,000 --> 03:21:45,000
television industry from my perspective

5888
03:21:45,000 --> 03:21:47,000
from doing all that again for me

5889
03:21:47,000 --> 03:21:49,000
you know obviously there's people that are into it but for me

5890
03:21:49,000 --> 03:21:51,000
too competitive and too cut throat and

5891
03:21:51,000 --> 03:21:53,000
you know kind of the same thing with radio to some extent

5892
03:21:53,000 --> 03:21:55,000
but when I was doing college radio I kind of

5893
03:21:55,000 --> 03:21:57,000
got to do things on my own terms and you know

5894
03:21:57,000 --> 03:21:59,000
it didn't matter if no one was listening even if one

5895
03:21:59,000 --> 03:22:01,000
person was listening it was hilarious

5896
03:22:01,000 --> 03:22:03,000
and got to have fun doing it so

5897
03:22:03,000 --> 03:22:05,000
when internet radio came about it seemed like a real

5898
03:22:05,000 --> 03:22:07,000
natural progression although to be fair

5899
03:22:07,000 --> 03:22:09,000
I think without Travis

5900
03:22:09,000 --> 03:22:11,000
having kind of helped me make that

5901
03:22:11,000 --> 03:22:13,000
transition he's the host of

5902
03:22:13,000 --> 03:22:15,000
Under Station Alive I don't know if I would've

5903
03:22:15,000 --> 03:22:17,000
gotten into internet radio as quickly

5904
03:22:17,000 --> 03:22:19,000
as I did I think I would've

5905
03:22:19,000 --> 03:22:21,000
gotten here eventually

5906
03:22:21,000 --> 03:22:23,000
but I don't think I would've gotten into it

5907
03:22:23,000 --> 03:22:25,000
as quickly as I did outside of school but if

5908
03:22:25,000 --> 03:22:27,000
I actually wanted to go way way back and I don't think

5909
03:22:27,000 --> 03:22:29,000
I've talked about this a lot on the show but way

5910
03:22:29,000 --> 03:22:31,000
back in high school a friend

5911
03:22:31,000 --> 03:22:33,000
of mine used to have a public access show we

5912
03:22:33,000 --> 03:22:35,000
actually did on the local television

5913
03:22:35,000 --> 03:22:37,000
station so I actually had a TV show for about

5914
03:22:37,000 --> 03:22:39,000
two years my good

5915
03:22:39,000 --> 03:22:41,000
friend in high school and I actually produced this show

5916
03:22:41,000 --> 03:22:43,000
that we did it had nothing to do with video games it was more like a

5917
03:22:43,000 --> 03:22:45,000
little comedy show that we did just because we could

5918
03:22:45,000 --> 03:22:47,000
and it was great we got turned

5919
03:22:47,000 --> 03:22:49,000
on it was great there are very few

5920
03:22:49,000 --> 03:22:51,000
copies out there in existence and I am

5921
03:22:51,000 --> 03:22:53,000
very very

5922
03:22:53,000 --> 03:22:55,000
careful to not let that hit the internet

5923
03:22:55,000 --> 03:22:57,000
because I just don't want it out there they're all in your

5924
03:22:57,000 --> 03:22:59,000
mom's garage right ah somewhere

5925
03:22:59,000 --> 03:23:01,000
yeah my

5926
03:23:01,000 --> 03:23:03,000
friend Shannon would have copies of every

5927
03:23:03,000 --> 03:23:05,000
episode somewhere and my

5928
03:23:05,000 --> 03:23:07,000
mother has them somewhere although I don't know where they

5929
03:23:07,000 --> 03:23:09,000
are and the tapes probably melted by now and I've

5930
03:23:09,000 --> 03:23:11,000
YouTube I nope nope

5931
03:23:11,000 --> 03:23:13,000
that's I will not let them out because I do not

5932
03:23:13,000 --> 03:23:15,000
want them on YouTube because unfortunately

5933
03:23:15,000 --> 03:23:17,000
now that I do have this show

5934
03:23:17,000 --> 03:23:19,000
I think if people were to see that

5935
03:23:19,000 --> 03:23:21,000
I just it's no

5936
03:23:21,000 --> 03:23:23,000
and granted it would be a pain

5937
03:23:23,000 --> 03:23:25,000
in the ass to rip that from

5938
03:23:25,000 --> 03:23:27,000
video tape right now yeah

5939
03:23:27,000 --> 03:23:29,000
but unfortunately if it fell in the wrong hands it would

5940
03:23:29,000 --> 03:23:31,000
be done sooner than I would like it

5941
03:23:31,000 --> 03:23:33,000
to happen I'm not it's not

5942
03:23:33,000 --> 03:23:35,000
that I'm necessarily like embarrassed or whatever

5943
03:23:35,000 --> 03:23:37,000
but it's just you know what it's just not

5944
03:23:37,000 --> 03:23:39,000
what I do now

5945
03:23:39,000 --> 03:23:41,000
ah so ah

5946
03:23:41,000 --> 03:23:43,000
yeah but I did that show and that was a lot of fun and

5947
03:23:43,000 --> 03:23:45,000
the whole reason I got into that in the first place

5948
03:23:45,000 --> 03:23:47,000
what I wanted to get to to answer your question

5949
03:23:47,000 --> 03:23:49,000
ah I had

5950
03:23:49,000 --> 03:23:51,000
a substitute teacher one day

5951
03:23:51,000 --> 03:23:53,000
in a physics class and he came in

5952
03:23:53,000 --> 03:23:55,000
and he was actually trying to do his little like

5953
03:23:55,000 --> 03:23:57,000
emotional thing like you know because the public access

5954
03:23:57,000 --> 03:23:59,000
station was kind of hurting for more volunteers

5955
03:23:59,000 --> 03:24:01,000
and so forth and he was actually showing us a

5956
03:24:01,000 --> 03:24:03,000
video that he did like a music

5957
03:24:03,000 --> 03:24:05,000
video and my friend and I looked at each

5958
03:24:05,000 --> 03:24:07,000
other and thought this is so

5959
03:24:07,000 --> 03:24:09,000
like

5960
03:24:09,000 --> 03:24:11,000
ghetto that like if

5961
03:24:11,000 --> 03:24:13,000
he can do this we can do this

5962
03:24:13,000 --> 03:24:15,000
and that was honestly what got us

5963
03:24:15,000 --> 03:24:17,000
into it so we should do public

5964
03:24:17,000 --> 03:24:19,000
access that'd be hilarious it's so

5965
03:24:19,000 --> 03:24:21,000
funny to me now to hear when people

5966
03:24:21,000 --> 03:24:23,000
say man orange

5967
03:24:23,000 --> 03:24:25,000
launch radio and I've had people say this and it's like the

5968
03:24:25,000 --> 03:24:27,000
ultimate compliment I can get orange

5969
03:24:27,000 --> 03:24:29,000
launch radio like got me into doing what I'm

5970
03:24:29,000 --> 03:24:31,000
doing today because I heard it and I was like

5971
03:24:31,000 --> 03:24:33,000
I want to do something like that actually

5972
03:24:33,000 --> 03:24:35,000
actually that is

5973
03:24:35,000 --> 03:24:37,000
you guys are kind of my inspiration

5974
03:24:37,000 --> 03:24:39,000
I've listened to you guys since

5975
03:24:39,000 --> 03:24:41,000

03:24:43,000 --> 03:24:45,000
station which I did mention in a

5978
03:24:45,000 --> 03:24:47,000
beatmania review for KIOS

5979
03:24:47,000 --> 03:24:49,000

5984
03:24:57,000 --> 03:24:59,000
reviewing beatmania so I figured

5985
03:24:59,000 --> 03:25:01,000
you know if you like you know the stuff that you

5986
03:25:01,000 --> 03:25:03,000
hear of the clubs during the rave period

5987
03:25:03,000 --> 03:25:05,000
or the stuff that you might have heard way back

5988
03:25:05,000 --> 03:25:07,000
when on orange launch radio bemonnie

5989
03:25:07,000 --> 03:25:09,000

6001
03:25:31,000 --> 03:25:33,000
broadcasting students

6002
03:25:33,000 --> 03:25:35,000

6004
03:25:37,000 --> 03:25:39,000
to you that is awesome

6005
03:25:39,000 --> 03:25:41,000
but I laugh because when people

6006
03:25:41,000 --> 03:25:43,000
when people tell me that I think

6007
03:25:43,000 --> 03:25:45,000
back to the video I saw in high school and I go

6008
03:25:45,000 --> 03:25:47,000
I hope people aren't saying I was inspired by

6009
03:25:47,000 --> 03:25:49,000
orange launch radio because they thought this show

6010
03:25:49,000 --> 03:25:51,000
was so terrible and ghetto

6011
03:25:51,000 --> 03:25:53,000
I can see that

6012
03:25:53,000 --> 03:25:55,000
but even if that's the reason then more

6013
03:25:55,000 --> 03:25:57,000
power to you I don't even care

6014
03:25:57,000 --> 03:25:59,000
I think it's great actually I had somebody tell me to my

6015
03:25:59,000 --> 03:26:01,000
face that they got into public access

6016
03:26:01,000 --> 03:26:03,000
because they thought my old TV show

6017
03:26:03,000 --> 03:26:05,000
they said blah blah blah was so

6018
03:26:05,000 --> 03:26:07,000
terrible and so awful

6019
03:26:07,000 --> 03:26:09,000
that you guys really inspired me to do this and I

6020
03:26:09,000 --> 03:26:11,000
was like oh thank you

Loki gets out any other last minute stories he wants

6040
03:26:49,000 --> 03:26:51,000
I was going to say um

6041
03:26:51,000 --> 03:26:53,000

6042
03:26:53,000 --> 03:26:55,000

03:27:01,000 --> 03:27:03,000
in the game of course Bad

6047
03:27:03,000 --> 03:27:05,000
Beat It, Billie Jean, The Earth Song

6048
03:27:05,000 --> 03:27:07,000
The Girl Is Mine, Who Is It

6049
03:27:07,000 --> 03:27:09,000
and Workin' Day and Night

6050
03:27:09,000 --> 03:27:11,000
Workin' Day and Night's the only one I don't

6051
03:27:11,000 --> 03:27:13,000
recognize but

6052
03:27:13,000 --> 03:27:15,000
I'm sure I've heard it I just don't recognize

6053
03:27:15,000 --> 03:27:17,000
it by the title

6054
03:27:17,000 --> 03:27:19,000
um yeah so that's it

6055
03:27:19,000 --> 03:27:21,000
they have some really stupid looking

6056
03:27:21,000 --> 03:27:23,000
you know how they do those lifestyle

6057
03:27:23,000 --> 03:27:25,000
shots where they have like someone playing the game

6058
03:27:25,000 --> 03:27:27,000
and they show like you know

6059
03:27:27,000 --> 03:27:29,000
what it looks like on screen

6060
03:27:29,000 --> 03:27:31,000
this guy looks like a douche

6061
03:27:31,000 --> 03:27:33,000
so I don't know if I want to play this game

6062
03:27:33,000 --> 03:27:35,000
because I don't want to be that douchey guy

6063
03:27:35,000 --> 03:27:37,000
I kind of am curious

6064
03:27:37,000 --> 03:27:39,000
I'm curious just to see what it is

6065
03:27:39,000 --> 03:27:41,000
I might play it once in a dark room

6066
03:27:41,000 --> 03:27:43,000
when nobody can see me

6067
03:27:43,000 --> 03:27:45,000
and then I was going to mention there's a game

6068
03:27:45,000 --> 03:27:47,000
um called Minitroid

6069
03:27:47,000 --> 03:27:49,000
that is I don't know if it's out yet

6070
03:27:49,000 --> 03:27:51,000
or it's possibly being worked on

6071
03:27:51,000 --> 03:27:53,000
but it's basically a

6072
03:27:53,000 --> 03:27:55,000
remake or demake of

6073
03:27:55,000 --> 03:27:57,000
Metroid 2 but it's a

6074
03:27:57,000 --> 03:27:59,000
browser game and um

6075
03:27:59,000 --> 03:28:01,000
it's really

6076
03:28:01,000 --> 03:28:03,000
cute looking it's kind of small

6077
03:28:03,000 --> 03:28:05,000
but uh

6078
03:28:05,000 --> 03:28:07,000
I don't think it's been released

6079
03:28:07,000 --> 03:28:09,000
yet but it is coming

6080
03:28:09,000 --> 03:28:11,000
alright

6081
03:28:11,000 --> 03:28:13,000
oh indiegames.com

6082
03:28:13,000 --> 03:28:15,000
let's see here

6083
03:28:15,000 --> 03:28:17,000

and it's like four links in

6090
03:28:29,000 --> 03:28:31,000
it's really annoying

6091
03:28:31,000 --> 03:28:33,000
well speaking of annoying

6092
03:28:33,000 --> 03:28:35,000

6102
03:28:53,000 --> 03:28:55,000
that's it that's all

6103
03:28:55,000 --> 03:28:57,000
I have to talk about

6104
03:28:57,000 --> 03:28:59,000

hiatus or what have you

you have no more last minute stories

6112
03:29:13,000 --> 03:29:15,000
no I'm just dealing with some hate in the chat room

6113
03:29:15,000 --> 03:29:17,000
I'm dealing with it

6114
03:29:17,000 --> 03:29:19,000

6115
03:29:19,000 --> 03:29:21,000

6116
03:29:21,000 --> 03:29:23,000

you can get it at Best Buy for $29.95

6121
03:29:31,000 --> 03:29:33,000
it is not a

6122
03:29:33,000 --> 03:29:35,000
upgrade so you can buy the new game

6123
03:29:35,000 --> 03:29:37,000
as it is just for that price

6124
03:29:37,000 --> 03:29:39,000
and it comes with a free month

6125
03:29:39,000 --> 03:29:41,000
and it lets you do a character that you can

6126
03:29:41,000 --> 03:29:43,000
switch sides and become a villain or a

6127
03:29:43,000 --> 03:29:45,000
mercenary and there's a whole new world in there

6128
03:29:45,000 --> 03:29:47,000

03:30:35,000 --> 03:30:37,000
like making the stop sign it said stop

6154
03:30:37,000 --> 03:30:39,000
