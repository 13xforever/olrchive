WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:20.760
Tonight, June 20th, 2010, we talk about Nintendo going 3D, Microsoft going Kinect, Sony joining

00:20.760 --> 00:31.840
forces with Steam, and more on our E3 wrap-up show, live.

00:31.840 --> 00:35.720
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome to another week of that video

00:35.720 --> 00:41.160
game talk show where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.

00:41.160 --> 00:45.240
Joining you over the next three hours, my name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always,

00:45.240 --> 00:49.120
say hello to the one, the only, Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

00:49.120 --> 00:50.120
Hi.

00:50.120 --> 00:52.760
Hi, how are you, Jamie?

00:52.760 --> 00:53.760
I'm doing better.

00:53.760 --> 00:57.280
You're doing a little better in the voice department, it sounds like, but...

00:57.280 --> 01:02.800
Yeah, but yesterday the wind kicked up and allergies got crazy so my voice was like...

01:02.800 --> 01:06.120
At least you don't sound as terrible as I did on some of those nightly shows from E3

01:06.120 --> 01:07.120
this week.

01:07.120 --> 01:09.800
The Rob Roberts and Pals and Laryngitis is what it really should have been called, it

01:09.800 --> 01:10.800
was pretty bad.

01:10.800 --> 01:11.800
Pals with Laryngitis.

01:11.800 --> 01:16.000
Oh, the smart ass over there is Loki, Tech Master Loki, how are you?

01:16.000 --> 01:17.440
I'm fine.

01:17.440 --> 01:19.520
And did you have a good week?

01:19.520 --> 01:20.520
Not sure.

01:20.520 --> 01:21.520
Yeah?

01:21.520 --> 01:27.520
All right, so obviously the big pink elephant in the room, E3 was this past week and there's

01:27.520 --> 01:29.720
lots and lots of news that we're gonna cover.

01:29.720 --> 01:33.640
We realize a lot of you guys probably watch the press conferences and so forth so we don't

01:33.640 --> 01:37.320
wanna reinvent the wheel here, although we do have some casual people listening to the

01:37.320 --> 01:38.320
show.

01:38.320 --> 01:40.620
We wanna make sure the big stuff is touched on for them.

01:40.620 --> 01:44.680
But also, I do wanna point out, we wanna talk about the stuff that you wanna hear about

01:44.680 --> 01:45.840
live.

01:45.840 --> 01:49.680
So make sure you join us in our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com if you are listening

01:49.680 --> 01:54.400
live on this Sunday night, cuz we do tape live every Sunday night at All Games Radio,

01:54.400 --> 01:59.500
www.allgames.com at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.

01:59.500 --> 02:03.480
So we're gonna be taking your questions about E3 and what you think maybe wasn't covered

02:03.480 --> 02:05.400
well enough or maybe has been covered too much.

02:05.400 --> 02:09.820
We're gonna take your Twitter questions, your emails, and all that fun stuff, as we always

02:09.820 --> 02:11.720
do here on that show where every gamer has a voice.

02:11.720 --> 02:15.820
We're gonna start off though, I mean, why change a good formula?

02:15.820 --> 02:17.080
Just because it was E3 week.

02:17.080 --> 02:20.680
We need to talk about the games we've been playing, and what kind of games you played

02:20.680 --> 02:21.680
this week.

02:21.680 --> 02:23.440
So, Dark Soccer, why don't you start us off.

02:23.440 --> 02:24.440
How was your game week?

02:24.440 --> 02:27.240
And by the way, actually, I should say this before you get started.

02:27.240 --> 02:31.480
Dark Soccer and Loki were unable to go to E3 this year due to personal stuff.

02:31.480 --> 02:32.480
Yeah, rub it in.

02:32.480 --> 02:33.480
Well, I'm sorry.

02:33.480 --> 02:34.480
I don't mean to rub it in.

02:34.480 --> 02:37.520
But just, you know, in case the listeners are like, well, they're just gonna talk about

02:37.520 --> 02:38.520
E3 all week.

02:38.520 --> 02:39.520
No, no.

02:39.520 --> 02:42.960
I mean, there was other games to be played besides just the ones at the LA Convention

02:42.960 --> 02:44.120
Center.

02:44.120 --> 02:50.260
I played Star Trek Online, which I was playing when you guys got here.

02:50.260 --> 02:53.360
And I wanted to thank Bobby for going ten minutes over because it gave me time to finish

02:53.360 --> 02:54.720
my mission.

02:54.720 --> 02:57.160
So thank you, Bobby.

02:57.160 --> 02:59.800
I was busy shooting Romulans.

02:59.800 --> 03:00.800
Good times.

03:00.800 --> 03:04.720
What else did I play?

03:04.720 --> 03:05.720
That's really it.

03:05.720 --> 03:08.280
You've just been addicted to Star Trek Online all week?

03:08.280 --> 03:09.280
That's cool.

03:09.280 --> 03:10.280
Yeah, that's what I played.

03:10.280 --> 03:11.760
I really didn't play a whole lot because I started school.

03:11.760 --> 03:12.760
Oh, again?

03:12.760 --> 03:14.760
I thought you just finished.

03:14.760 --> 03:15.760
I'm going in the summer.

03:15.760 --> 03:16.760
Oh, boy.

03:16.760 --> 03:18.080
All right, summer school.

03:18.080 --> 03:21.200
Remember when summer school was just for the kids that flunked during the regular semester?

03:21.200 --> 03:22.440
Now everybody does summer school.

03:22.440 --> 03:25.280
Well, I do have to mention that I told you this earlier.

03:25.280 --> 03:29.880
My teacher – I'm taking U.S. history – my teacher brought up the Oregon Trail.

03:29.880 --> 03:30.880
Nice.

03:30.880 --> 03:35.840
And she said, you remember that game, you know, where you have to stockpile meat and

03:35.840 --> 03:36.840
everything?

03:36.840 --> 03:37.840
We're like, Oregon Trail.

03:37.840 --> 03:38.840
She's like, yeah, that game.

03:38.840 --> 03:41.320
It's like, well, people really did die from all this stuff.

03:41.320 --> 03:45.920
And I told her about your shirt, the one that said, you have died of dysentery.

03:45.920 --> 03:48.280
And she laughed and then looked a little bit sick.

03:48.280 --> 03:51.760
My teacher's also a little preggers.

03:51.760 --> 03:52.820
Oh, I see.

03:52.820 --> 03:54.600
So she carried a couple of pounds back to the wagon?

03:54.600 --> 03:55.600
Yes.

03:55.600 --> 03:56.600
Ah, I see.

03:56.600 --> 03:59.160
You know that game where you're on a trail to Oregon?

03:59.160 --> 04:00.160
What's it called again?

04:00.160 --> 04:01.160
I don't know.

04:01.160 --> 04:02.160
All right.

04:02.160 --> 04:04.280
Loki, how was your gaming week?

04:04.280 --> 04:05.640
I just played Grand Theft Auto.

04:05.640 --> 04:06.640
That's pretty much it.

04:06.640 --> 04:07.640
That's it?

04:07.640 --> 04:09.360
That's all I had time for.

04:09.360 --> 04:11.600
I don't think I played anything else.

04:11.600 --> 04:13.640
Oh, a little bit of Earth Defense Force.

04:13.640 --> 04:14.720
Just getting through that some more.

04:14.720 --> 04:20.420
But mainly just Grand Theft Auto because I had to go lose a game by $2 one day.

04:20.420 --> 04:24.480
So it means I had to take it out on my coworkers by kicking the crap out of them.

04:24.480 --> 04:28.440
It was funny, though, because one of the games actually quadrupled second place's score.

04:28.440 --> 04:32.200
I had $4,000 and the person below me had $1,000.

04:32.200 --> 04:34.400
I kicked the crap out of them.

04:34.400 --> 04:36.600
That was in 15 minutes, too, by the way.

04:36.600 --> 04:40.880
Apparently my boss was bragging to Take Two because they had a meeting with them about

04:40.880 --> 04:44.520
how wonderful I am at Grand Theft Auto, to which I'm sure they didn't care.

04:44.520 --> 04:49.520
Yeah, I was going to say, I don't think Take Two would really be concerned with how good

04:49.520 --> 04:50.520
you are.

04:50.520 --> 04:53.640
He's like, did you know that there's somebody that works with us that's in the top 100 in

04:53.640 --> 04:54.640
the world?

04:54.640 --> 04:55.640
No, really?

04:55.640 --> 04:59.800
Which I was like, okay, whatever.

04:59.800 --> 05:02.560
You were glued to the E3 press conferences all week, though, right?

05:02.560 --> 05:06.800
Yeah, I watched those instead of working because I can do that.

05:06.800 --> 05:07.800
So were we.

05:07.800 --> 05:11.160
We were watching from our hotel room because we don't get invited to fun stuff like that,

05:11.160 --> 05:12.560
but that's okay.

05:12.560 --> 05:18.920
So we got to watch them all from the comfort of our historic hotel room in downtown LA,

05:18.920 --> 05:21.960
not far from where all the rioting was taking place after game seven, but I digress.

05:21.960 --> 05:27.040
What did you think of all the press conferences as you were watching them, Loki?

05:27.040 --> 05:28.040
They were pretty cool.

05:28.040 --> 05:34.960
What was kind of unique, I guess, is no one really kind of failed at press conferences.

05:34.960 --> 05:35.960
There wasn't any...

05:35.960 --> 05:43.360
Nintendo, thank God, did not show anything about the Vitality sensor, which makes me

05:43.360 --> 05:46.040
believe that they're not putting it out anymore.

05:46.040 --> 05:51.320
I think they kept what's-her-name Kami tied up in a burlap bag backstage somewhere.

05:51.320 --> 05:53.560
She was unable to be freed during the press conference.

05:53.560 --> 05:54.560
Hopefully sufficiently beaten.

05:54.560 --> 05:55.560
Aw, poor thing.

05:55.560 --> 05:58.240
She's just trying to do her job.

05:58.240 --> 05:59.240
I don't know.

05:59.240 --> 06:00.240
What do we want to talk about?

06:00.240 --> 06:01.240
Just each press conference?

06:01.240 --> 06:02.240
Or do we want to...

06:02.240 --> 06:05.400
Well, I want to talk about my gaming week because I played about 40 games this week.

06:05.400 --> 06:06.400
So let's get started.

06:06.400 --> 06:07.400
We'll take your time.

06:07.400 --> 06:08.400
All right.

06:08.400 --> 06:09.400
No, no.

06:09.400 --> 06:10.400
I'm not going to repeat.

06:10.400 --> 06:14.040
Oh, I will talk about something because it is gaming related, but not video games.

06:14.040 --> 06:19.060
I've been working on the baby's room some more and doing stuff regarding that.

06:19.060 --> 06:21.560
I'm building a custom mobile.

06:21.560 --> 06:23.800
I've actually done the wiring for it and it works perfectly.

06:23.800 --> 06:27.760
Well, except for yesterday because I broke it, but that was just from trying to show

06:27.760 --> 06:30.880
people and the wire came off, but I can fix that.

06:30.880 --> 06:35.180
Anyway, so I have this thing now where if I flip a switch, an on-off switch, it basically

06:35.180 --> 06:39.760
plays an MP3 lullaby of the Super Mario Brothers theme.

06:39.760 --> 06:42.860
At the same time, it will also spin a motor.

06:42.860 --> 06:43.860
That's pretty awesome.

06:43.860 --> 06:47.720
I'm going to shove it into an acrylic cube that's going to become a question block and

06:47.720 --> 06:48.800
hang stuff from it.

06:48.800 --> 06:52.080
And I've started drawing on the wall.

06:52.080 --> 06:59.080
I posted on Twitter and Facebook the design I have for the room, which is looking like

06:59.080 --> 07:01.200
new Super Mario Brothers.

07:01.200 --> 07:02.200
That sounds so adorable.

07:02.200 --> 07:03.200
I could barf, honestly.

07:03.200 --> 07:04.720
It's going to be awesome.

07:04.720 --> 07:10.280
I'm not going to recap everything I played at the actual E3 show because we had the daily

07:10.280 --> 07:11.280
shows.

07:11.280 --> 07:14.000
I'm sure a lot of them will come up as we go over tonight's news, which is going to

07:14.000 --> 07:15.680
be a little more free for them tonight.

07:15.680 --> 07:19.460
If you guys have questions in chat and during the Twitter topics and calls, if you want

07:19.460 --> 07:22.920
to know if I touched a certain game, I'd be happy to give you my thoughts on it.

07:22.920 --> 07:27.480
But one thing I think we all have to keep in mind about E3, and I sensed us during the

07:27.480 --> 07:32.060
daily shows, sometimes veering off that path a little bit, we're looking at very early

07:32.060 --> 07:33.060
builds of things.

07:33.060 --> 07:37.180
And a lot of times the reason why companies want to have these, make an appointment to

07:37.180 --> 07:40.480
see the game, or you're not going to play it, I'm going to play it for you, and all

07:40.480 --> 07:45.600
this stuff, is because they don't want people to form 100% opinions about games from these

07:45.600 --> 07:47.600
demos on the show floor.

07:47.600 --> 07:52.160
I think it takes a lot of guts to put your game out there on the show floor at E3, guts

07:52.160 --> 07:56.000
that clearly Activision and Blizzard don't have anymore from not having their booths

07:56.000 --> 08:00.280
open to the public at E3.

08:00.280 --> 08:02.320
But didn't they quit E3 last year?

08:02.320 --> 08:04.920
Well, they still had a booth.

08:04.920 --> 08:08.480
Most everything was behind closed doors at that booth, but they've been scaling further

08:08.480 --> 08:09.480
and further back.

08:09.480 --> 08:10.480
But I'm digressing a little bit.

08:10.480 --> 08:16.220
I could go on this whole other tangent about BlizzCon and Blizzard, and how I am a big

08:16.220 --> 08:21.200
stan of World of Warcraft, I love that game, it's amazing, I am not fucking going to BlizzCon

08:21.200 --> 08:22.200
ever.

08:22.200 --> 08:23.200
Ever.

08:23.200 --> 08:25.200
Because it's a joke.

08:25.200 --> 08:28.140
They should have just had a big sign out front of their booth that says, seriously, you've

08:28.140 --> 08:32.600
seen this stuff before, it's just more of the same.

08:32.600 --> 08:34.880
Well anyway, I'm getting off the path a little bit.

08:34.880 --> 08:38.720
Because I actually did play games that weren't just at E3, so I want to get those out of

08:38.720 --> 08:43.420
the way, because I know most of the people listening to this show didn't go to E3, so

08:43.420 --> 08:47.640
you guys are probably playing a lot of standby games to catch up on, just like I was.

08:47.640 --> 08:51.400
So I will mention this, I played, you might remember a couple weeks on the show, I said,

08:51.400 --> 08:53.320
I'm going to beat three games this summer.

08:53.320 --> 08:56.260
And I'm falling a little behind on my goal, but I finally found a game I want to play

08:56.260 --> 09:01.040
to completion after getting about a third of the way through it.

09:01.040 --> 09:08.760
I played Alan Wake, which is a game that was a long time in the making, it was from Microsoft

09:08.760 --> 09:14.560
Game Studios, one of their internal development teams that created the game.

09:14.560 --> 09:21.800
I guess you could say it's Microsoft's answer to Silent Hill, but a little less of the crazy

09:21.800 --> 09:28.580
creatures and things of that sort, and a little more of the strange paranormal sort of stuff.

09:28.580 --> 09:32.980
I really like how immersive the game feels to me, I like a lot of the small touches that

09:32.980 --> 09:34.080
they've done with the game.

09:34.080 --> 09:39.240
There's these little TVs that when you come across them will play little episodes of The

09:39.240 --> 09:41.800
Twilight Zone, or at least kind of their version of that.

09:41.800 --> 09:47.640
I think they call it Night Springs, is what they call it, which Shane pointed out to me,

09:47.640 --> 09:51.280
is because the town name is called Bright Falls, so Night Springs is like the opposite

09:51.280 --> 09:54.400
of that, and I didn't catch that right away, it's funny.

09:54.400 --> 09:59.320
I really love the fog effects, they're very scary, and I think they're done very well.

09:59.320 --> 10:02.480
And I think it's a survival horror game, it's pretty cool, it's immersive, it feels like

10:02.480 --> 10:08.760
you're watching a TV show, and it's been compared to Twin Peaks in other places, and I think

10:08.760 --> 10:13.040
that's a very fair comparison, because you have a lot of those eccentric characters,

10:13.040 --> 10:20.760
strange stories, WTF is going on feeling, and yeah, I'm really liking Alan Wake so far,

10:20.760 --> 10:22.480
it's a good game.

10:22.480 --> 10:27.760
Lots of little things to collect for achievements and so forth, great environments to interact

10:27.760 --> 10:31.440
with, very large environments where you'll be walking down a trail, and then suddenly

10:31.440 --> 10:36.280
you get in a car and drive to the other side of the map, and this is all seamless, where

10:36.280 --> 10:41.200
you maybe started the mission earlier, but everything has changed since you were gone,

10:41.200 --> 10:45.040
but there's no loading in between all of this, so the map is kind of changing dynamically

10:45.040 --> 10:47.200
as you're away, which I think is very cool.

10:47.200 --> 10:51.680
So yeah, I've been really enjoying Alan Wake.

10:51.680 --> 10:54.520
I'm looking forward to seeing some of the download content they're gonna put with that.

10:54.520 --> 10:57.400
So I'll tell you more about the game when I get a little closer to completing, because

10:57.400 --> 11:02.360
some of the reviews I have read about the game online really razzed the ending, but

11:02.360 --> 11:05.440
I don't want to read what the ending is, because I'm really into the story right now, and I'm

11:05.440 --> 11:09.520
trying to find my own theories about what's happening, so when I do beat this game, I

11:09.520 --> 11:12.520
will kind of come back and let you know if I was as disappointed as some of the other

11:12.520 --> 11:13.520
reviewers were.

11:13.520 --> 11:16.920
Well, they also have the episodic content that's coming out port 2, I think, should

11:16.920 --> 11:17.920
be interesting.

11:17.920 --> 11:21.160
Oh yeah, there's at least two coming out, but they have a countdown timer in the game

11:21.160 --> 11:22.680
to when the first one's coming out.

11:22.680 --> 11:27.120
By the way, the game has major product placement, which I found very, very shameless product

11:27.120 --> 11:33.000
placement, like Alan Wake uses a Verizon telephone, the car that he's driving in one scene has

11:33.000 --> 11:38.940
sync by Microsoft in it, and Energizer batteries are what you use in light, which is a very

11:38.940 --> 11:40.160
interesting battle mechanic.

11:40.160 --> 11:43.720
It's not like Silent Hill where you kind of have to run away from everything, you can

11:43.720 --> 11:48.720
do that, but it's very much a kind of light versus dark sort of thing in Alan Wake, and

11:48.720 --> 11:52.240
the goal is you have to burn them down with your flashlight, and then they're vulnerable

11:52.240 --> 11:56.760
to get shot, and you can kind of go through and kill things, but you can use light from

11:56.760 --> 12:01.040
different sources, not just your flashlight, but you can use the headlights on a car, you

12:01.040 --> 12:04.920
could attract the monsters towards a pole that has light shining from it, and it would

12:04.920 --> 12:05.920
burn them down.

12:05.920 --> 12:06.940
It's very interesting.

12:06.940 --> 12:12.480
I'm surprised that Energizer would agree to have their batteries in a game where you have

12:12.480 --> 12:16.120
to keep collecting batteries because they keep running out really fast.

12:16.120 --> 12:21.080
It's like, uh, shouldn't I just collect one Energizer battery and be done with it for

12:21.080 --> 12:22.080
the whole game?

12:22.080 --> 12:24.400
I mean, isn't that the message we're trying to send across?

12:24.400 --> 12:29.080
Well, if you don't burn your batteries by, because you can focus the light energy on

12:29.080 --> 12:32.880
a monster and that burns your batteries real quick, but if you don't do that, you can burn

12:32.880 --> 12:36.800
them down very slowly, although it's tough to dodge in that way, and then your batteries

12:36.800 --> 12:38.520
slowly recharge.

12:38.520 --> 12:42.920
So if you're kind of smart about the way you do it, you don't ever burn through a battery,

12:42.920 --> 12:47.840
because you just burn it down, slowly recharge, burn it down again, recharge, but sometimes

12:47.840 --> 12:49.040
it just becomes too much chaos.

12:49.040 --> 12:52.120
Okay, that's just witchcraft now.

12:52.120 --> 12:55.080
Well, maybe that's the trick, I don't know.

12:55.080 --> 12:57.080
So yeah, Alan Wake, I had a good time with that.

12:57.080 --> 13:00.360
So that's one of the games I've been playing outside of the whole E3 show.

13:00.360 --> 13:03.920
Also we took a trip to Arcade Infinity one of the nights we were there at E3 just to

13:03.920 --> 13:06.360
go, you know, see what's new over there.

13:06.360 --> 13:07.720
What's new over there?

13:07.720 --> 13:12.680
Well, new versions of all the same damn games we've been playing for ten years.

13:12.680 --> 13:18.440
I played Guitar Freaks X, what the hell are they on now, X5 I think?

13:18.440 --> 13:19.440
I don't know.

13:19.440 --> 13:20.440
I just lost count.

13:20.440 --> 13:21.440
Doesn't matter.

13:21.440 --> 13:25.240
It's the same game I played ten years ago, just with new music, so whatever, it was fine.

13:25.240 --> 13:26.240
I played D2Max Technica.

13:26.240 --> 13:29.800
But don't the X games have like the, uh, No way, I didn't play it myself, I watched

13:29.800 --> 13:30.800
Shane play it.

13:30.800 --> 13:31.800
I thought I was playing it in my head.

13:31.800 --> 13:36.680
Were the X games the ones that have like the extra buttons on it, or is that the different

13:36.680 --> 13:37.680
one I'm thinking of?

13:37.680 --> 13:38.680
No, it's just three buttons.

13:38.680 --> 13:42.880
I'm thinking the DX ones or something, or GX, or, I don't know what the hell it's called.

13:42.880 --> 13:44.120
Who cares, it's damn Guitar Freaks.

13:44.120 --> 13:48.120
I played Pop and Music the movie, I don't even know what version of the game that is.

13:48.120 --> 13:49.520
It's like 16 or something.

13:49.520 --> 13:53.840
Whatever, I played that for a little bit, and, you know, playing big buttons.

13:53.840 --> 13:59.280
See Konami, this is the game you can put out 16 versions of, not beat and groovy.

13:59.280 --> 14:01.720
I don't understand why you're getting confused.

14:01.720 --> 14:05.040
How do we make this game again?

14:05.040 --> 14:07.960
And then I played a little bit of DJ Max, because Shane made me, because I was like,

14:07.960 --> 14:10.960
oh, there's actually some songs in Technica I really like, and he's like, really?

14:10.960 --> 14:14.400
You gotta play DJ Max on the PSP, you can play these songs, and he's like, you can do

14:14.400 --> 14:16.680
four buttons and five buttons and six buttons.

14:16.680 --> 14:20.360
So I ended up playing a little bit of that too, and he was strongly encouraging me to

14:20.360 --> 14:24.160
buy DJ Max on the PSP, which I might do, maybe at some point.

14:24.160 --> 14:25.160
There were some songs I liked.

14:25.160 --> 14:26.160
It's not worth it.

14:26.160 --> 14:27.160
Really?

14:27.160 --> 14:28.160
I've tried it on PSP.

14:28.160 --> 14:30.480
You can get it for like, with all the sales going on right now and used and everything,

14:30.480 --> 14:31.480
like ten bucks?

14:31.480 --> 14:33.480
Eh, that might even be worth it then.

14:33.480 --> 14:34.480
So.

14:34.480 --> 14:35.480
Alright.

14:35.480 --> 14:37.560
So that was the games outside of E3 that I played.

14:37.560 --> 14:40.840
I don't know, you guys wanna know, just here in studio, about anything at E3?

14:40.840 --> 14:44.320
Were you curious about any of the stuff, the games there, that you might have heard I got

14:44.320 --> 14:47.920
my hands on?

14:47.920 --> 14:50.160
Marvel vs. Capcom 3, did you try that at all?

14:50.160 --> 14:51.160
I did.

14:51.160 --> 14:53.640
They had about ten characters playable on the show floor.

14:53.640 --> 14:55.120
I got to actually play it twice.

14:55.120 --> 14:59.080
The lines were excruciatingly long at Capcom's booth, but the game was also at Microsoft's

14:59.080 --> 15:04.720
booth and Sony's booth, and so the lines were much shorter at Microsoft's booth.

15:04.720 --> 15:05.720
So I did play it.

15:05.720 --> 15:10.460
I had a team of like, Ryu, Morgan, Felicia in one of them, and I used like Deadpool in

15:10.460 --> 15:13.720
another one, just for Jamie, you know, because I know she'd be happy if I did that.

15:13.720 --> 15:15.700
And I think I used Captain America.

15:15.700 --> 15:18.440
And you know, I'm not super into this series.

15:18.440 --> 15:24.320
I was always more of a Capcom vs. SNK fan, but it played a lot like 2 to me, it just

15:24.320 --> 15:27.160
had more stylistic graphics.

15:27.160 --> 15:28.160
I like the way it looks.

15:28.160 --> 15:32.680
It didn't flip into that 3D as much as I thought it would, like Street Fighter IV does, you

15:32.680 --> 15:33.680
know what I mean?

15:33.680 --> 15:36.440
Like I mean, it's not a 3D game, but you know how Street Fighter IV, like a lot of it has

15:36.440 --> 15:37.440
the 3D elements?

15:37.440 --> 15:40.680
It didn't do that as much as I thought it would, I mean during some of the specials

15:40.680 --> 15:44.560
and so forth, but I think if you're a fan of Marvel vs. Capcom 2, you're not going to

15:44.560 --> 15:45.560
be disappointed.

15:45.560 --> 15:52.320
It's a high def, widescreen, cel-shaded, stylistic game, and I'm sure y'all will be happy.

15:52.320 --> 15:53.320
I am.

15:53.320 --> 15:54.320
Can't wait.

15:54.320 --> 15:59.840
Jamie, now, did you see the extended trailer that they had for Marvel vs. Capcom 3?

15:59.840 --> 16:03.080
The one that included Deadpool vs. Dante?

16:03.080 --> 16:06.600
You had that in there, but did you see where he gets attacked by Morgan or...?

16:06.600 --> 16:10.320
Yeah, see, that's ex- I saw the Iron Man vs. Morgan.

16:10.320 --> 16:13.960
Well, there's an extended trailer that's all those little cutscenes or whatever.

16:13.960 --> 16:20.840
He has one part where he gets attacked by her, she has like those spikes or whatever

16:20.840 --> 16:24.920
that come out, and they hit him in the ass.

16:24.920 --> 16:26.480
Dante looked like a badass character.

16:26.480 --> 16:30.520
Shane was playing as Dante, and he was whooping me, and it took like two of my characters

16:30.520 --> 16:35.440
to bring Dante down, but then I guess Chris is either really hard to use or just stinks

16:35.440 --> 16:38.000
or something, because I took him out like that, and then we were even again.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
Probably really hard to use.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
Yeah.

16:40.000 --> 16:45.160
What's his face from Dead Rising?

16:45.160 --> 16:46.160
Frank West?

16:46.160 --> 16:47.160
Yeah, Frank West.

16:47.160 --> 16:49.520
He was not in the demo, so I couldn't tell you.

16:49.520 --> 16:53.320
But I will say Dead Rising 2, full of lols.

16:53.320 --> 16:58.120
I like the Fortune City setting for it, the Vegas is a cool little setting for it.

16:58.120 --> 17:01.480
One of the weapons we saw used on zombies was great.

17:01.480 --> 17:06.680
It was like this, okay, imagine like an old style lawn mower that you have to do manually,

17:06.680 --> 17:09.140
but it's motorized on the bottom instead.

17:09.140 --> 17:12.920
So like you could pick this up, and then like he would push it into the zombie and chop

17:12.920 --> 17:13.920
him in half.

17:13.920 --> 17:14.920
Maybe like a mulcher?

17:14.920 --> 17:15.920
Yeah, like a mulcher type of thing.

17:15.920 --> 17:16.920
It was awesome.

17:16.920 --> 17:17.920
I laughed my ass off.

17:17.920 --> 17:18.920
They had that in the first game, sort of.

17:18.920 --> 17:19.920
Well, it was different.

17:19.920 --> 17:22.200
It was like an actual lawn mower that I remember.

17:22.200 --> 17:26.160
I have a feeling Dead Rising 2 is really just kind of more of the same, but it was, we laughed.

17:26.160 --> 17:27.160
Who cares?

17:27.160 --> 17:28.160
It's a great formula.

17:28.160 --> 17:29.160
We laughed and laughed.

17:29.160 --> 17:31.200
There's only one thing they needed to do, and that was just fix the save system.

17:31.200 --> 17:32.200
That's done.

17:32.200 --> 17:33.200
We're good.

17:33.200 --> 17:36.880
Look into our chat room at chat.orangelawnsradio.com if you're listening to us live on Sunday

17:36.880 --> 17:37.880
night.

17:37.880 --> 17:38.880
Why not come join us?

17:38.880 --> 17:42.040
We have a question from chat about questions and comments.

17:42.040 --> 17:46.640
Tiger Claw says, I like how Deadpool yells, you press the wrong button when he loses in

17:46.640 --> 17:47.640
the game.

17:47.640 --> 17:50.440
I didn't see that, but it's so loud on the show floor.

17:50.440 --> 17:52.400
You can't really hear a lot of the games.

17:52.400 --> 17:56.320
I will say, though, one of the soundtracks that sounded like I could hear was the Tron

17:56.320 --> 17:58.800
game that they were demoing at the Disney booth.

17:58.800 --> 18:01.200
I played the Tron game on PlayStation 3.

18:01.200 --> 18:02.840
Okay, here's what it is.

18:02.840 --> 18:08.360
Imagine Prince of Persia got totally reskinned with Tron graphics.

18:08.360 --> 18:09.680
That's what the fucking Tron game is.

18:09.680 --> 18:13.840
See, I thought it was more of like the force unleashed in the Tron universe type thing.

18:13.840 --> 18:14.840
I know.

18:14.840 --> 18:15.840
It played like Prince of Persia.

18:15.840 --> 18:20.800
Like even the demo, you do the wall walking, the big flips, the jumping over objects.

18:20.800 --> 18:22.720
It really felt like Prince of Persia to me.

18:22.720 --> 18:24.680
But it used the Daft Punk soundtrack.

18:24.680 --> 18:25.680
Like I could tell.

18:25.680 --> 18:28.040
And so I'm like, oh, this has a sweet soundtrack to it.

18:28.040 --> 18:32.840
It was very nice and very stylistic with the disks being thrown and everything going in

18:32.840 --> 18:34.120
slow motion.

18:34.120 --> 18:38.120
But I think a lot of people, like Shane, never saw Tron, and he's kind of looking at me playing

18:38.120 --> 18:40.440
the game and he's going, the graphics in this suck.

18:40.440 --> 18:43.120
And I'm like, it's Tron.

18:43.120 --> 18:45.720
Their wire frame graphics is what it's supposed to look like.

18:45.720 --> 18:46.720
He'll learn.

18:46.720 --> 18:47.720
He didn't get it.

18:47.720 --> 18:48.720
In due time.

18:48.720 --> 18:49.720
I know.

18:49.720 --> 18:50.720
He'll get it someday.

18:50.720 --> 18:51.720
Let's see.

18:51.720 --> 18:52.720
Other questions from chat.

18:52.720 --> 18:54.220
Chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

18:54.220 --> 19:00.000
Some folks wanting to know, it looks like, who's asked it here?

19:00.000 --> 19:02.720
Ray Iannami is saying it's yet another Symphony of the Night remake.

19:02.720 --> 19:04.840
I guess they're talking about the Castlevania game.

19:04.840 --> 19:07.440
Oh, Tigerclaw is asking, did you play the new Castlevania game?

19:07.440 --> 19:09.840
I did.

19:09.840 --> 19:15.160
It does use a lot of the same skins from Symphony of the Night and it plays very similar.

19:15.160 --> 19:19.960
But yet at the same time, it feels a lot different because it has what I call this Neo Geo effect

19:19.960 --> 19:23.080
where it zooms in and out of parts of the castle.

19:23.080 --> 19:24.080
Mode 7!

19:24.080 --> 19:25.080
Well, you can control that.

19:25.080 --> 19:26.440
It's not arbitrary.

19:26.440 --> 19:32.000
You control that by clicking the left or the right button, one of them.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.840
You would actually control that.

19:33.840 --> 19:36.020
But I found it very hard to get through the maze.

19:36.020 --> 19:38.120
It was a hard rush for 10 minutes.

19:38.120 --> 19:41.280
The problem with the game is that no one was really explaining the game to us and there

19:41.280 --> 19:45.560
was no on-screen rules or whatever in the demo so we just kind of had to figure it out.

19:45.560 --> 19:48.320
And yeah, it really did feel a lot like Symphony of the Night.

19:48.320 --> 19:51.640
But the multiplayer element does seem to add something pretty cool to it.

19:51.640 --> 19:54.360
And yes, you can do co-op or competitive.

19:54.360 --> 19:55.360
So that's kind of fun.

19:55.360 --> 19:57.560
I think it'll be a fun little arcade title.

19:57.560 --> 19:58.880
Depends what they charge for it.

19:58.880 --> 20:01.120
If they try to charge like 30 bucks for it, no.

20:01.120 --> 20:02.120
It's gonna be $15.

20:02.120 --> 20:03.120
$15 is fine.

20:03.120 --> 20:04.120
Probably.

20:04.120 --> 20:05.120
It seems like it'll be a good deal for $15.

20:05.120 --> 20:07.320
$15 is a new five.

20:07.320 --> 20:11.960
The other Castlevania game, I can tell, was not a Castlevania game when it started.

20:11.960 --> 20:17.400
It looked a lot more like God of War or Bayonetta, but it's really pretty.

20:17.400 --> 20:18.400
And it's very stylistic.

20:18.400 --> 20:21.880
And it has sparkle ponies.

20:21.880 --> 20:25.640
And it has Patrick Stewart, excuse me, Sir Patrick Stewart doing some of the voiceover

20:25.640 --> 20:28.520
works in little in-between montages.

20:28.520 --> 20:29.520
But there was this cool little sequence.

20:29.520 --> 20:31.260
I want him to be a playable character.

20:31.260 --> 20:34.640
There was this cool little sequence where like you're on a wolf that's kind of riding

20:34.640 --> 20:40.380
and you can jump onto the other wolf and throw the guy off and it's, it's, Castlevania meets

20:40.380 --> 20:41.380
God of War.

20:41.380 --> 20:46.600
But I think if people are expecting like an old school Castlevania game, the arcade game's

20:46.600 --> 20:47.600
for you.

20:47.600 --> 20:48.600
Not this new one.

20:48.600 --> 20:50.400
This new one is a different direction for the series.

20:50.400 --> 20:53.320
I wonder if they call that level Operation Wolf.

20:53.320 --> 20:55.880
Um, let's see.

20:55.880 --> 20:56.880
Other comments.

20:56.880 --> 21:03.160
Oh, it looks like some folks are asking about the 3D Castlevania game there as well.

21:03.160 --> 21:04.160
Let's see.

21:04.160 --> 21:06.320
They're asking about the Tron.

21:06.320 --> 21:08.680
Tiger class says, hopefully the multiplayer will kick ass.

21:08.680 --> 21:11.540
Like if they have the classic light cycle versus light cycle from the original Tron

21:11.540 --> 21:12.560
in 3D.

21:12.560 --> 21:13.960
That's the Wii game.

21:13.960 --> 21:17.140
The Wii game had a whole little light cycle thing in 3D.

21:17.140 --> 21:18.720
That is exactly what the Wii game is.

21:18.720 --> 21:19.720
So there you go.

21:19.720 --> 21:21.280
Well, no, it's gonna have that also in the other ones.

21:21.280 --> 21:22.280
Oh, they were showing that in the demo.

21:22.280 --> 21:23.440
They were probably just showing different levels.

21:23.440 --> 21:24.440
Yeah.

21:24.440 --> 21:25.440
Most likely.

21:25.440 --> 21:26.440
Most likely.

21:26.440 --> 21:28.840
I could tell the graphical difference though between the Wii and the other ones.

21:28.840 --> 21:32.840
Well Tron is supposed to be in 3D also in the PlayStation 3 version.

21:32.840 --> 21:35.640
I'm not sure about the 360 though.

21:35.640 --> 21:38.920
I will tell you about a couple other games just kind of off the top of my head.

21:38.920 --> 21:41.380
There's a few that I want to talk about for sure.

21:41.380 --> 21:43.960
A couple of them are music based so bear with me a minute.

21:43.960 --> 21:48.240
Rock Band 3 is gonna be a worthy upgrade.

21:48.240 --> 21:52.120
They talked very quickly about some of the stylistic changes that they've made to the

21:52.120 --> 21:57.480
menus where you really see your band kind of grow up on the main menu.

21:57.480 --> 22:02.360
They've talked about how they have a new condensed mode where you can basically do the entire

22:02.360 --> 22:05.320
band from start to finish in about four hours worth of gameplay.

22:05.320 --> 22:09.400
So it's like an instant rock band party basically if you want to invite people over.

22:09.400 --> 22:14.520
And I think most importantly as the rock band library has been growing and so forth, they

22:14.520 --> 22:17.560
have put in filters on the song list.

22:17.560 --> 22:22.480
And I know a lot of people are wondering this, all of the rock band songs are importable

22:22.480 --> 22:25.940
into Rock Band 3 with the exception of the Beatles which I don't think comes as a surprise

22:25.940 --> 22:26.940
to anyone.

22:26.940 --> 22:32.100
But this Uber machine that they were playing on had Rock Band 2, Lego Rock Band, Green

22:32.100 --> 22:34.520
Day Rock Band, I mean everything else was importable.

22:34.520 --> 22:38.380
This Uber machine they were playing on had like 1300 songs, it was nuts.

22:38.380 --> 22:40.120
I know all about that.

22:40.120 --> 22:45.320
The realistic mode, I didn't understand it at all on guitar because I don't play the

22:45.320 --> 22:46.320
guitar.

22:46.320 --> 22:51.760
Guitar seemed really confusing, essentially 120, I mean I'm sure it's just like, yeah

22:51.760 --> 22:52.760
I don't know how to play the guitar.

22:52.760 --> 22:57.520
I don't know how to play the guitar but watching the guy play that White Stripes song and then

22:57.520 --> 23:01.900
they plugged in an amp at the same time, they like doubled, because there's two guitar peripherals.

23:01.900 --> 23:05.000
One of them has all the buttons and then the other one's like a real guitar that you can

23:05.000 --> 23:10.340
use to play rock band basically in this special mode and I guess they double jacked it into

23:10.340 --> 23:14.400
the game and the amp and what they did, they turned down the game volume and turned up

23:14.400 --> 23:17.560
the amp and he was playing the White Stripes song, it was like the real song.

23:17.560 --> 23:21.480
So I think this will answer a lot of people's calls like, well if you, and especially like

23:21.480 --> 23:26.040
music, you know music snobs and people in the bands, Rock Band isn't real guitar playing.

23:26.040 --> 23:30.960
It is funny though, like that game Power Gig gets announced way back and everyone's like

23:30.960 --> 23:34.240
oh my god you know it's a game that's going to teach you how to play guitar and then Rock

23:34.240 --> 23:39.240
Band 3 comes out, oh it's exactly the same thing, ah crap.

23:39.240 --> 23:42.520
But I will say one instrument I know a little more about is the keyboards and getting to

23:42.520 --> 23:45.320
see the real keyboard mode, I was like whoa cool.

23:45.320 --> 23:48.880
I do want to correct one thing I had said, speculated I guess I should say earlier on

23:48.880 --> 23:51.960
the show and that is when you're playing in the five bar mode, I think that's what they

23:51.960 --> 23:57.520
call it, the five bar mode, which is you know like regular rock band on the keyboard, it

23:57.520 --> 24:02.800
is not the color bars that you see at the top of the keyboard, you use right in the

24:02.800 --> 24:07.240
middle, you use middle C, D, E, F, G, for those of you guys that know your piano, you're

24:07.240 --> 24:10.880
basically using just five keys right next to each other to play five bar mode.

24:10.880 --> 24:14.340
You're only going to use the full keyboard if you actually choose to play in pro mode.

24:14.340 --> 24:18.640
But I, as a keyboard player many many many many years ago, I was in heaven, I thought

24:18.640 --> 24:19.640
it was great.

24:19.640 --> 24:20.640
I think it looks awesome.

24:20.640 --> 24:21.640
Looks awesome.

24:21.640 --> 24:27.760
Dr. 945 in our chat room, chat.orangetongue.com, excuse me, The Dr. 945 says have you guys

24:27.760 --> 24:31.240
seen the complete track list wall, that's a lot of songs on rock band, yes it was in

24:31.240 --> 24:34.880
their booth, it was right across from where we were playing rock band three, it is very

24:34.880 --> 24:38.600
impressive and they also had a bar graph, I don't know if that made it into the pictures

24:38.600 --> 24:42.280
as well, that says here's how many they have in rock band, here's how many are in guitar

24:42.280 --> 24:47.120
hero, it was a lot less.

24:47.120 --> 24:52.000
I really really didn't want to like Dance Central, but I do.

24:52.000 --> 24:57.160
The Kinect games, because I kind of, and I'll let Loki kind of cover Microsoft's press conference

24:57.160 --> 25:00.800
and some of the highlights and lowlights in a minute, but I think a lot of us walked away

25:00.800 --> 25:05.520
from Microsoft's press conference kind of going, oh these Kinect seem like the gimmicky

25:05.520 --> 25:10.300
crap we saw on the Wii a couple years ago, but you know what, getting up there and actually

25:10.300 --> 25:15.360
playing Dance Central was actually kind of fun and moving back and forth and it wasn't

25:15.360 --> 25:18.560
as complicated as I thought it was going to be from first looking at it to follow the

25:18.560 --> 25:23.960
guy on the screen, it kind of felt like doing aerobics in a way, and I think that's the

25:23.960 --> 25:26.580
Kinect's biggest strength, it's going to be exergaming heaven is what it is.

25:26.580 --> 25:33.320
If you've ever taken a dance class, it's basically how they break it down in a dance class, basically

25:33.320 --> 25:40.160
like a long time ago in high school I took a street dance class during, it was like sophomore

25:40.160 --> 25:44.560
year or something, and it was fun for like a summer, and basically what they do is they

25:44.560 --> 25:49.720
teach you small little bits, like different techniques or whatever, and then you string

25:49.720 --> 25:53.400
it together in a routine, and that's basically what this game is, they teach you a bunch

25:53.400 --> 25:57.640
of small techniques and then you string it together in a routine, which is cool, I think

25:57.640 --> 26:03.680
that's, I mean, I'm not sure if I would actually play this a lot because my wife would just

26:03.680 --> 26:09.200
not get it, she would just be like, you look like a dumbass, I can see it right now, and

26:09.200 --> 26:14.180
it would be kind of fun though, I still may get it anyways, but god no it's not going

26:14.180 --> 26:19.880
to ever appear on the internet with me in a video, never ever, unless I get really good

26:19.880 --> 26:24.560
at it, in which case, maybe, but even still, no.

26:24.560 --> 26:30.040
So I mean that's kind of cool, and the song list looks pretty cool on it, but if we're

26:30.040 --> 26:35.240
going to compare it to say Dance Masters, let me put it this way, if you took what you

26:35.240 --> 26:39.760
learned from Dance Central and actually went to a club and did it, you might look alright,

26:39.760 --> 26:44.040
you took Dance Masters and did what they have in that game, you're going to look like an

26:44.040 --> 26:45.040
idiot.

26:45.040 --> 26:49.760
Well I don't know if I go that far, because I think it was hard to see, and I wanted to

26:49.760 --> 26:55.280
get into Dance Masters, but for me the biggest difference between the two games is, yeah

26:55.280 --> 26:58.600
the style of dance was definitely different between the two, but it's the song list, and

26:58.600 --> 27:04.300
that's really what it's going to ultimately come down to, and if Dance Masters continues

27:04.300 --> 27:09.080
down this path of DDR looking songs, there's going to be a niche audience for it, which

27:09.080 --> 27:13.800
is most of the people that have grown up with this show for the past 8 years since we started

27:13.800 --> 27:18.880
talking exclusively about DDR, but Dance Central will be the game that sells superior to it

27:18.880 --> 27:20.700
in America anyway.

27:20.700 --> 27:23.960
I don't think Dance Central is even going to come out in Japan, and I think Dance Masters

27:23.960 --> 27:24.960
will rule over there.

27:24.960 --> 27:28.980
Here's the thing though about Dance Masters, and actually Dance Central, I'd be more willing

27:28.980 --> 27:33.140
to back Dance Central because I know how harmonics is with download content.

27:33.140 --> 27:35.520
They will deliver on download content.

27:35.520 --> 27:40.360
Konami, they've promised to deliver on download content for every single dance game that's

27:40.360 --> 27:46.320
come out, even the Karaoke Revolution games that have come out, never have they actually

27:46.320 --> 27:47.320
come through.

27:47.320 --> 27:51.400
It's just been, oh we'll put out a couple things to download content, we're done.

27:51.400 --> 27:56.640
Oh yeah we promised you all this stuff, but like fuck if they're going to deliver it.

27:56.640 --> 28:00.000
Well two things I think are important to say about Dance Masters, one of them is that,

28:00.000 --> 28:04.320
and I mentioned this on one of the daily shows this week, the Rob Roberts and Pals that were

28:04.320 --> 28:08.180
on the feed earlier this week, I got served a nice slice of humble pie this week because

28:08.180 --> 28:13.520
something I probably said back in 02 or 03 in the early early days of OLR, I know I clearly

28:13.520 --> 28:19.400
said, get over it, Para Para Paradise is never coming to the US, absolutely will not happen.

28:19.400 --> 28:23.720
Sure enough here we are seven, eight years later, Dance Masters is basically Para Para

28:23.720 --> 28:24.720
Paradise.

28:24.720 --> 28:29.540
I mean they're going to tell you different songs, it's not all Europe-y, professionally

28:29.540 --> 28:31.880
choreographed, but it's still the wrong way.

28:31.880 --> 28:37.000
Here's my thing, because the only song that I saw, I mean they have like two songs that

28:37.000 --> 28:41.680
they showed, they showed one it was some Naoki Smile Decay song, and they had another one

28:41.680 --> 28:43.120
that was Night of Fire.

28:43.120 --> 28:49.120
Now I can understand if those maybe have Para dancing to them because it's more Japanese,

28:49.120 --> 28:50.800
the Para Club stuff.

28:50.800 --> 28:57.080
Now the other songs that are in the game that say are other genres of music, do those have

28:57.080 --> 29:02.800
different types of dancing, different styles, because that might be kind of alright.

29:02.800 --> 29:08.080
If it's all Para, like if it's Para to some Pink song or something like that, that's a

29:08.080 --> 29:09.160
little weird.

29:09.160 --> 29:13.920
If it's actually different styles, like if they have country songs with country dancing

29:13.920 --> 29:20.040
to it, or if they've got hip hop songs with more street jazz type stuff in there, that

29:20.040 --> 29:21.260
makes sense.

29:21.260 --> 29:25.360
But if it's just all this Para style dancing, that's kind of weird.

29:25.360 --> 29:29.380
I actually thought though, I will say this, I actually thought Dance Masters was the more

29:29.380 --> 29:34.280
graphically appealing game in kind of looking at them both side to side.

29:34.280 --> 29:38.320
I think in the end, Dance Central was the more easier to follow kind of dance, but I

29:38.320 --> 29:42.440
thought Dance Masters kind of looked better in some ways.

29:42.440 --> 29:43.440
It's hard to explain.

29:43.440 --> 29:46.400
I think a lot of people are probably going to just end up picking up both, especially

29:46.400 --> 29:50.840
the crowd that I think mostly listens to this show, but I think ultimately Dance Central

29:50.840 --> 29:52.280
is going to prevail in the scales here.

29:52.280 --> 29:54.520
I'll check out the other one, but I'll pick up Dance Central.

29:54.520 --> 29:55.960
Dance Masters will do better overseas.

29:55.960 --> 29:56.960
Well absolutely.

29:56.960 --> 30:00.920
But yeah, I had a good time with those games.

30:00.920 --> 30:02.920
So let's see, those were the music games.

30:02.920 --> 30:05.280
How about something for the non-music game fans?

30:05.280 --> 30:06.280
Because this was...

30:06.280 --> 30:10.520
Real quick, I was going to say one thing, I mean it wasn't shown on the floor or anything,

30:10.520 --> 30:16.360
but one of the games I saw footage of that I thought was really awesome is DJ Hero 2

30:16.360 --> 30:20.600
that they're going to be doing, well the karaoke part, cool, whatever.

30:20.600 --> 30:24.720
But I do like all the different stuff that they have now where the samples that you do

30:24.720 --> 30:29.680
during the freestyle portions are actually part of the song, it's not just crappy flava

30:29.680 --> 30:32.000
flave samples over top of everything.

30:32.000 --> 30:36.820
And also the freestyle scratching, the freestyle cross-fading stuff looks pretty cool.

30:36.820 --> 30:40.720
You know what game unfortunately I did not get my hands on but Shane did and he swears

30:40.720 --> 30:43.160
it was probably one of the best games he played at the show?

30:43.160 --> 30:44.680
DJ Hero 3D.

30:44.680 --> 30:48.280
Yes, I actually want to pick that up.

30:48.280 --> 30:49.280
Looks awesome.

30:49.280 --> 30:54.560
From what I understand it was a really great experience on the 3DS, so I wish I'd seen

30:54.560 --> 30:57.040
it myself but no I got to play some other stuff.

30:57.040 --> 31:01.760
I think I played Sims 3 on the 3DS actually, funny enough, which takes your picture and

31:01.760 --> 31:05.240
then builds your little Sims character to look like you.

31:05.240 --> 31:06.240
To look like your picture?

31:06.240 --> 31:10.200
Yes, do you know how huge my nose was?

31:10.200 --> 31:12.520
I was a little offended actually.

31:12.520 --> 31:15.840
That's still a pretty cool feature, hope they have that in the other versions.

31:15.840 --> 31:16.840
That's pretty cool.

31:16.840 --> 31:19.520
I just don't want to see how fat my Sim's going to be.

31:19.520 --> 31:20.520
Well luckily it only takes pictures of your face.

31:20.520 --> 31:21.520
Cannot fit on screen.

31:21.520 --> 31:23.520
It only takes pictures of your face, luckily.

31:23.520 --> 31:27.240
I'm like, I have more hair left than that, what are you telling me?

31:27.240 --> 31:32.760
That's for the 3DS version, you never know with these Kinect cameras and move and stuff.

31:32.760 --> 31:37.000
Alright so some folks in chat seem to be getting confused, let's also just clarify.

31:37.000 --> 31:43.280
Harmonix is making Dance Central, which is more of the do this for 8 counts, do this

31:43.280 --> 31:47.820
for 4 counts, do this for 16 counts type of dance game, breaking it down.

31:47.820 --> 31:54.920
Dance Masters is the Konami game that functions a little more like Para Para, but when I say

31:54.920 --> 31:59.040
that, it's not 6 streams that you break, it is nothing like that at all, it is tracing

31:59.040 --> 32:01.440
motions on the screen and posing in certain ways.

32:01.440 --> 32:03.400
It's like Para Para and Elite Beat Agents combined.

32:03.400 --> 32:07.520
Yes, that's a good way of describing it actually.

32:07.520 --> 32:11.320
How about some non-music games for a minute, because there's one that really surprised

32:11.320 --> 32:12.320
me at the show.

32:12.320 --> 32:13.320
Don't they exist?

32:13.320 --> 32:14.320
Yes.

32:14.320 --> 32:18.560
By the way, Jamie, since you have the mic up for a minute, I want to ask you, is there

32:18.560 --> 32:20.240
a dance game that you're going to pick up?

32:20.240 --> 32:22.800
Or are you like, no thank you, I don't really want to dance, or what?

32:22.800 --> 32:27.200
No I think that I want to play Para Para at home, and it's actually kind of funny because

32:27.200 --> 32:30.680
just a few days ago I was thinking about hooking up the biscuits.

32:30.680 --> 32:33.760
Now what you should have done is done the, because you probably know the Night of Fire

32:33.760 --> 32:35.200
routine, right?

32:35.200 --> 32:37.120
No, not by heart.

32:37.120 --> 32:38.840
Oh, well.

32:38.840 --> 32:39.840
What about Sheen?

32:39.840 --> 32:40.840
No, Sheen doesn't play Para.

32:40.840 --> 32:41.840
No, no.

32:41.840 --> 32:44.800
I would have been able to do Boom Boom Fire is probably the only one I still remember

32:44.800 --> 32:45.800
after all these years.

32:45.800 --> 32:51.900
Hey, I went and played the Para around the corner from, you know, on Arcadia, and I remembered

32:51.900 --> 32:52.900
my stuff.

32:52.900 --> 32:55.120
I could shake my butt.

32:55.120 --> 32:58.760
I probably could have remembered with the stuff on the screen, but why did I need to

32:58.760 --> 32:59.760
do it?

32:59.760 --> 33:02.480
Bobby Black Wolf, there's a video of him on the internet doing the Night of Fire routine.

33:02.480 --> 33:03.480
You should have done it.

33:03.480 --> 33:04.820
Free publicity, Rob.

33:04.820 --> 33:08.800
When I got up there, Shane specifically said, you better not play Night of Fire.

33:08.800 --> 33:09.800
So I did the Smile DK song.

33:09.800 --> 33:10.800
Thank you, Shane.

33:10.800 --> 33:11.800
Thank you.

33:11.800 --> 33:12.800
Thank you.

33:12.800 --> 33:13.800
All right.

33:13.800 --> 33:14.800
Look, I want to get past this.

33:14.800 --> 33:17.560
I do want to say this, though, because somebody who was doing the Night of Fire dance right

33:17.560 --> 33:21.080
there at the booth the day I was there, Naoki was there on the floor.

33:21.080 --> 33:22.080
I got a picture with him.

33:22.080 --> 33:23.080
I got to put it on Facebook.

33:23.080 --> 33:28.120
I promised you, if I had a chance to meet Naoki, I would ask him one question, and that

33:28.120 --> 33:30.440
question is, and this is how the interaction went.

33:30.440 --> 33:33.160
I said, you know, hi there, can I get a picture?

33:33.160 --> 33:34.400
And then he said, you know, thank you.

33:34.400 --> 33:36.520
And I said, hold on, just one question.

33:36.520 --> 33:40.180
I said, is that Facebook really you?

33:40.180 --> 33:43.000
And he doesn't speak very good English, he was kind of like Facebook.

33:43.000 --> 33:44.560
And I was like, Facebook?

33:44.560 --> 33:47.920
And I kind of pointed to my phone, because I don't know how else to describe Facebook.

33:47.920 --> 33:49.640
I'm like, is it you?

33:49.640 --> 33:52.240
And I'm kind of like pointing on Facebook.

33:52.240 --> 33:55.920
And he's like, oh, yes, yes, me on Facebook.

33:55.920 --> 33:58.280
And so yes, that Naoki Facebook is really him.

33:58.280 --> 34:03.000
They made the mistake, and I kind of feel bad, you know, they made the mistake of him

34:03.000 --> 34:07.820
actually speaking during the Konami press conference.

34:07.820 --> 34:09.200
And that was the most weird thing.

34:09.200 --> 34:10.200
He's adorable.

34:10.200 --> 34:11.200
Come on.

34:11.200 --> 34:13.200
I know he's adorable, but he doesn't speak good English.

34:13.200 --> 34:19.160
So give the guy a damn translator, you know, same with the guy that was describing 99 Nights.

34:19.160 --> 34:26.600
If you keep pushing X button and Y button, the game will suck, or you will be sucked.

34:26.600 --> 34:30.280
Come on, dude, I need a translator.

34:30.280 --> 34:32.280
Don't just let this guy wing it.

34:32.280 --> 34:36.320
Do not hate on Naoki on this show, he is adorable.

34:36.320 --> 34:39.780
He looks like, you know what he looks like a person, a hyper little kitty cat.

34:39.780 --> 34:42.440
He was running around the stage, taking little pictures of his iPhone.

34:42.440 --> 34:45.760
He was so happy that people were playing the game and having fun with it.

34:45.760 --> 34:46.760
He was so happy.

34:46.760 --> 34:51.500
You know, and more props to him, and I know it's not his fault that some of the last DDR

34:51.500 --> 34:55.800
games have really been terrible, and you know, and I kind of feel bad in that sense, because

34:55.800 --> 34:59.740
they've taken what he created and just kind of took a big dump on it, like they did with

34:59.740 --> 35:01.440
Beaten Groovy.

35:01.440 --> 35:05.960
But it's just, it's not, it's very awkward, okay?

35:05.960 --> 35:10.480
They had a lot of awkward moments during the Konami press conference, speaking of which,

35:10.480 --> 35:15.720
and I know it's just kind of like, eh, whatever, Glee, karaoke revolution game.

35:15.720 --> 35:17.320
Worst game I played at E3.

35:17.320 --> 35:20.000
Yes, I played it, and it's terrible.

35:20.000 --> 35:24.080
And I officially don't give a crap about Glee.

35:24.080 --> 35:27.080
It was one of those things when we walked in Konami's booth and I kind of looked over

35:27.080 --> 35:31.600
and I saw, I mean, it's huge, it was no secret, I was like, I kind of did that moment of,

35:31.600 --> 35:35.200
of course, of course, I should have fucking seen that coming, I should have known.

35:35.200 --> 35:37.920
Did I have Shane play Def Jam Rapstar?

35:37.920 --> 35:40.160
No, no, no, no.

35:40.160 --> 35:41.880
Here's why the Glee game was bad.

35:41.880 --> 35:45.240
They've basically just done away with the character models and everything.

35:45.240 --> 35:49.240
It just plays videos from Glee that sometimes match up with the song and sometimes just

35:49.240 --> 35:50.760
completely random videos.

35:50.760 --> 35:55.400
And it just, it's, it's not that great.

35:55.400 --> 36:00.080
I think I sat there, I think we sang, like, I don't even know what song we sang, but I

36:00.080 --> 36:03.600
was singing like this, I was going,

36:03.600 --> 36:04.600
Perfect!

36:04.600 --> 36:05.600
Yeah, 95%.

36:05.600 --> 36:08.840
Granted, I was on the easiest level, but geez.

36:08.840 --> 36:09.840
All right.

36:09.840 --> 36:10.840
All right.

36:10.840 --> 36:11.840
Please, a non-music game.

36:11.840 --> 36:12.840
Please, please, please.

36:12.840 --> 36:14.440
May I talk about a non-music game?

36:14.440 --> 36:15.440
No.

36:15.440 --> 36:16.960
Because there was a non-music game I played at the show.

36:16.960 --> 36:18.640
Child of Eden looks awesome, by the way.

36:18.640 --> 36:19.640
I'm done.

36:19.640 --> 36:20.640
Shut up!

36:20.640 --> 36:21.640
It does look very awesome.

36:21.640 --> 36:22.640
It has Kinky Rockets in it.

36:22.640 --> 36:23.640
They're doing the soundtrack.

36:23.640 --> 36:24.640
Shup, shup.

36:24.640 --> 36:25.640
Dude, I love Kinky Rockets.

36:25.640 --> 36:26.640
Hey!

36:26.640 --> 36:27.640
Hey, listen.

36:27.640 --> 36:32.600
Let me say this, because this is a game you would expect dark soccer to walk away from

36:32.600 --> 36:34.360
the show going, I really like this game.

36:34.360 --> 36:42.560
But it was me that walked away from the demo for DC Universe going, that PVP was a hell

36:42.560 --> 36:43.560
of a lot of fun.

36:43.560 --> 36:44.560
Who'd you play?

36:44.560 --> 36:46.120
Or did you make your own character?

36:46.120 --> 36:47.120
It's all make your own character.

36:47.120 --> 36:49.280
You cannot play as Batman or Wonder Woman or any of that.

36:49.280 --> 36:50.520
They play as guys.

36:50.520 --> 36:57.120
But all the raid gear, quote, unquote, is like clones of Wonder Woman and Superman and

36:57.120 --> 36:58.120
all that.

36:58.120 --> 37:00.920
So it looks like, you know, we didn't get to do too much of the character creation.

37:00.920 --> 37:06.560
It was all PVP, but it looks like your characters can kind of go down a Batman-y path or a Wonder

37:06.560 --> 37:08.160
Woman-y path.

37:08.160 --> 37:10.000
And the guy who demoed it was really great.

37:10.000 --> 37:15.200
He was one of the better demonstrators I was working with during E3.

37:15.200 --> 37:19.080
He really was trying to kind of, he could tell we were WoW players, and he was kind

37:19.080 --> 37:21.760
of just trying to break it down, like what some of the differences were.

37:21.760 --> 37:25.960
And he said that they don't want people to be kind of pigeonholed into these tank and

37:25.960 --> 37:27.480
healer and DPS roles.

37:27.480 --> 37:29.480
They kind of want everybody to be able to do everything.

37:29.480 --> 37:31.320
And I thought that was pretty cool.

37:31.320 --> 37:33.160
I just liked, it was more action-based.

37:33.160 --> 37:34.320
Here's the thing you need to keep in mind.

37:34.320 --> 37:36.920
DC Universe is a much more action-based MMO.

37:36.920 --> 37:41.080
Like the only action MMO I've really played to any extent is Phantasy Star Online and

37:41.080 --> 37:42.080
Phantasy Star Universe.

37:42.080 --> 37:43.080
I love PSO.

37:43.080 --> 37:48.240
But I mean, the action in that is really super slow compared to DC Universe.

37:48.240 --> 37:52.240
I mean, Phantasy Star is like sword, sword, sword.

37:52.240 --> 37:56.840
You know, whereas DC Universe is like punch, punch, punch, ice storm, drink a soda to refuel

37:56.840 --> 38:01.520
and then fly up and I swear the best, the moment where I was like, I need to get this

38:01.520 --> 38:04.160
game when it comes out November 2nd.

38:04.160 --> 38:07.520
Part of the PVP we were doing, it was heroes versus villains, of course.

38:07.520 --> 38:10.620
And all the people that were out on the show floor were basically the heroes.

38:10.620 --> 38:15.660
The villains were the people in the private rooms getting screened the game.

38:15.660 --> 38:20.160
And the guy was like, okay, I'm really not supposed to show you this, but okay, do this.

38:20.160 --> 38:22.480
The game was trying to hold down these forts.

38:22.480 --> 38:26.880
So it would be like heroes versus villains inside these little techy looking forts and

38:26.880 --> 38:28.980
whoever can hold it down longer would win it.

38:28.980 --> 38:31.600
He says, go fly onto the top of it.

38:31.600 --> 38:36.080
There's an EMP device and hold down the circle button until it counts down to zero.

38:36.080 --> 38:37.320
And so I did it.

38:37.320 --> 38:41.160
And then while you are holding down the circle button, it flashes back to a scene of the

38:41.160 --> 38:42.160
fortress.

38:42.160 --> 38:47.240
And once the countdown hits zero, boom, all of the villains went flying out of the room

38:47.240 --> 38:50.800
because the EMP device just, it's like a magnet thing that pushes them all out.

38:50.800 --> 38:52.320
And I was like, that was fucking rad.

38:52.320 --> 38:54.280
I can have this game now, please.

38:54.280 --> 38:55.280
Yeah.

38:55.280 --> 39:00.360
And the greatest part was knowing that all those villains were the mucky muck oppressed

39:00.360 --> 39:03.520
people in the super secret screenings.

39:03.520 --> 39:07.440
So I had a really good time with DJ or DJ universe, DC universe.

39:07.440 --> 39:11.640
So I want to pick that full game up when it comes out.

39:11.640 --> 39:14.400
Final Fantasy 14, we had a demo of that as well.

39:14.400 --> 39:19.360
Speaking of MMOs, the game looks astonishing.

39:19.360 --> 39:23.520
I feel like this game is not as far along as they would like it to be.

39:23.520 --> 39:28.840
I can also say, just knowing some people that are in the private alpha right now, the alpha

39:28.840 --> 39:32.880
really does not run very smoothly right now, even on pretty high end computers with a lot

39:32.880 --> 39:37.200
of gigs of RAM, none of the settings are changeable and the frame rates in the city is pretty

39:37.200 --> 39:38.200
bad.

39:38.200 --> 39:40.680
Granted, it's in an early alpha and what did I say before?

39:40.680 --> 39:44.680
We shouldn't be forming our final opinions of games off of demos, but the Final Fantasy

39:44.680 --> 39:48.680
14, there's a lot that I really like that they did with it.

39:48.680 --> 39:50.280
The guild labs, I think, are great.

39:50.280 --> 39:54.120
You can start quests out in the field and you can finish them right when you finish

39:54.120 --> 39:55.120
them.

39:55.120 --> 39:58.500
Monsters are marked, they're easy to find.

39:58.500 --> 40:02.880
You can scale the difficulty of any quest you do so that you can either solo quests

40:02.880 --> 40:03.880
or you can party.

40:03.880 --> 40:04.880
Thank you.

40:04.880 --> 40:06.880
I know, it seems like they've really fixed a lot of that.

40:06.880 --> 40:09.360
As long as they got rid of the level cap quests, I'm good with that.

40:09.360 --> 40:14.300
Now it's just a matter of making the game run smooth because even in the Uber, I was

40:14.300 --> 40:20.440
noticing some frame rate issues and I like my games to run very smoothly so I was a little

40:20.440 --> 40:23.720
antsy about that because the game's supposed to be coming out pretty soon, but I have a

40:23.720 --> 40:26.720
bad feeling it's going to need to go back to the drawing board for some tweaks a little

40:26.720 --> 40:28.640
bit to optimize it.

40:28.640 --> 40:33.960
I will say this, as it stands right now, I'll pick that game up on the PS3 because that's

40:33.960 --> 40:35.440
where they're going to have it optimized for.

40:35.440 --> 40:37.520
I think PC is going to be too much of a variable.

40:37.520 --> 40:41.520
Oh, did I mention one little unfortunate bombshell about DC Universe?

40:41.520 --> 40:47.000
I don't know if this is out there a lot, but the PC and PS3 versions are not cross-server

40:47.000 --> 40:48.000
at this time.

40:48.000 --> 40:49.720
Yeah, that's what they said last year too.

40:49.720 --> 40:53.560
And it sounds like a lot of the reason because of that, it's not that the developer doesn't

40:53.560 --> 40:58.120
want to do it, but it sounds like a lot of the reason has to do with kind of balancing

40:58.120 --> 40:59.120
issues.

40:59.120 --> 41:03.560
It's really different when somebody's playing on the PS3 versus the PC.

41:03.560 --> 41:06.600
And I do think Sony's kind of a little bit of a...

41:06.600 --> 41:08.480
Did you play it on the PS3 or the PC?

41:08.480 --> 41:09.760
I played it on the PS3.

41:09.760 --> 41:12.760
Yeah, PS3 was actually pretty easy to control.

41:12.760 --> 41:14.200
Yeah, I was very surprised.

41:14.200 --> 41:17.080
For an action-y game, it was cool.

41:17.080 --> 41:20.880
So, Tigerclaw in chat wants to know, and we're getting like 40 minutes into the show, we'll

41:20.880 --> 41:24.140
get into some news here and stuff in a minute, Tigerclaw says, did you get a chance to check

41:24.140 --> 41:25.480
out the new Twisted Metal?

41:25.480 --> 41:29.920
I watched other people play it, but I am not the big fan of the series that Loki is and

41:29.920 --> 41:30.920
so forth.

41:30.920 --> 41:33.560
I was very excited that they talked about the new Twisted Metal.

41:33.560 --> 41:37.720
But the thing is, they were showing off that Nuke mode, that seemed very confusing to me.

41:37.720 --> 41:41.720
Or at least, the whole idea where there's people in helicopters and stuff, that just

41:41.720 --> 41:42.720
didn't...

41:42.720 --> 41:44.680
I didn't understand what they were doing.

41:44.680 --> 41:46.700
I mean, it looks fun.

41:46.700 --> 41:55.560
It looks like a slightly better-looking version of Twisted Metal Black, but I kind of want

41:55.560 --> 42:00.000
to see what just a normal game looks like, other than that deathmatch mode.

42:00.000 --> 42:01.760
Because I liked Black a lot.

42:01.760 --> 42:02.760
I loved...

42:02.760 --> 42:07.000
I think that was one of the best Twisted Metal games besides Twisted Metal 2.

42:07.000 --> 42:10.920
All right, let's get into kind of wrapping up the press conferences a little more officially

42:10.920 --> 42:13.280
here than just little tidbits here and there.

42:13.280 --> 42:16.920
I do want to say some housekeeping real quick, though, because we're 40 minutes into the

42:16.920 --> 42:19.080
show, just now getting to housekeeping.

42:19.080 --> 42:21.840
Next week is our eight-year anniversary of Orange Launch Radio.

42:21.840 --> 42:26.120
Actually, technically, it's during the week this week, June 23rd, 2002 was our very first

42:26.120 --> 42:27.120
show.

42:27.120 --> 42:28.120
So happy eight week...

42:28.120 --> 42:29.120
Or eight weeks.

42:29.120 --> 42:31.720
Happy eight years to us next week.

42:31.720 --> 42:34.280
This week seemed like so long.

42:34.280 --> 42:36.240
We're not doing anything special for it, really.

42:36.240 --> 42:38.320
Just the same old thing we usually do.

42:38.320 --> 42:41.800
But just, you know, kind of want to thank our listeners for the support over the eight

42:41.800 --> 42:43.560
years of this show.

42:43.560 --> 42:46.080
There will be no show the week after that.

42:46.080 --> 42:50.500
That next Sunday is the actual 4th of July, which of course is a holiday here in the States.

42:50.500 --> 42:54.400
And just due to other things we all want to do that night, there will be no show on the

42:54.400 --> 42:55.400
4th of July.

42:55.400 --> 42:56.400
Okay?

42:56.400 --> 42:57.400
So that's really it for housekeeping.

42:57.400 --> 43:00.200
Otherwise, join us on Facebook, Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio.

43:00.200 --> 43:02.480
Join us on Twitter, Twitter.com slash OLR.

43:02.480 --> 43:04.360
We're still taking Twitter topics.

43:04.360 --> 43:08.560
If you have a story you want to share or questions about E3 you want to ask, mailbag is always

43:08.560 --> 43:09.560
open as well.

43:09.560 --> 43:11.880
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

43:11.880 --> 43:15.360
So the beginning of the show tonight, we want to keep it a little more freeform just in

43:15.360 --> 43:20.160
kind of wrapping up what happened at E3 and kind of summarizing the press conferences

43:20.160 --> 43:22.520
and what everybody kind of thought of the news.

43:22.520 --> 43:25.320
Loki, what do you want to say about Microsoft?

43:25.320 --> 43:30.400
Because they started everything off the first night before the actual floor show began.

43:30.400 --> 43:36.520
Microsoft came out there and in a nutshell focused mostly on Kinect and a bunch of games

43:36.520 --> 43:38.240
that we kind of already knew were coming.

43:38.240 --> 43:44.880
There was no new games outside of Kinect that were announced besides the one game that,

43:44.880 --> 43:47.600
I don't even remember the name of it now, that's what the type of impression it had

43:47.600 --> 43:48.600
on me.

43:48.600 --> 43:49.600
Yeah, I know what you're talking about.

43:49.600 --> 43:55.080
The Crytek Microsoft game studios that I thought was 300 the game because that's what it looked

43:55.080 --> 43:57.360
like, 300 the game.

43:57.360 --> 44:00.840
So that'll be interesting because Crytek does some really good work.

44:00.840 --> 44:04.280
Stuff that I thought was interesting about that press conference and we'll go over like

44:04.280 --> 44:07.480
every, well not every little detail, but just some of the basic stuff.

44:07.480 --> 44:17.200
The ESPN stuff coming to Xbox Live Marketplace, the actual streaming, I think is kind of cool.

44:17.200 --> 44:21.020
Not for me perhaps because I don't give a crap about sports, but for people that do

44:21.020 --> 44:27.080
like sports and there's a lot of them out there, I think that's kind of neat.

44:27.080 --> 44:34.280
The whole movie Kinect thing where you can control stuff just by voice command almost

44:34.280 --> 44:38.920
like sync and motion gestures and stuff like that, that's kind of neat.

44:38.920 --> 44:42.680
Can I back up a little bit about the ESPN thing because it kind of goes in that whole

44:42.680 --> 44:46.680
integrated television thing and I did think that was cool.

44:46.680 --> 44:50.760
I'm not into sports either as much as other people.

44:50.760 --> 44:54.840
I might put the local team in and just kind of try Sacramento Kings because that way I'll

44:54.840 --> 44:57.640
know if my coworkers are going to be in a good mood or a bad mood the next day.

44:57.640 --> 45:01.440
I'll kind of track that in the ESPN thing, but I don't think I'll use it for a lot more

45:01.440 --> 45:03.440
other than that.

45:03.440 --> 45:08.040
But what really disappointed me was that when we were talking about TV integration, I think

45:08.040 --> 45:12.120
one of the things that Microsoft did so well in this past year was one versus 100 and there

45:12.120 --> 45:14.920
was literally no news on that front.

45:14.920 --> 45:18.280
Not that game, not any of the other types of games that they were talking about.

45:18.280 --> 45:22.280
I was extremely disappointed that that subject didn't even come up.

45:22.280 --> 45:25.800
Yeah, that's too bad.

45:25.800 --> 45:29.240
But other stuff, obviously Kinect was pretty cool.

45:29.240 --> 45:36.120
They shut off a bunch of different game demo examples with that, including of course Kinectimals,

45:36.120 --> 45:37.400
which I think was pretty cool.

45:37.400 --> 45:43.400
If you're going to do one of those sim animal games, that is seriously the way to do it.

45:43.400 --> 45:44.680
To me, it was so well done.

45:44.680 --> 45:48.320
I think it's going to be a really big game with kids.

45:48.320 --> 45:56.240
And when you compare that to the iPad stuff, it just seems a little more natural to me

45:56.240 --> 46:02.720
instead of just trying to pet, trying to play with this augmented reality creature type

46:02.720 --> 46:03.720
thing.

46:03.720 --> 46:07.880
I don't know, it's like Milo in animal form almost.

46:07.880 --> 46:09.240
I was bored watching it.

46:09.240 --> 46:10.880
Yeah, but it's not meant for us.

46:10.880 --> 46:14.440
Yeah, but I feel like hardcore gamers really got the shaft at Microsoft's thing.

46:14.440 --> 46:15.440
We didn't get anything.

46:15.440 --> 46:17.120
I mean, it was a bunch of games we already knew about.

46:17.120 --> 46:20.720
Yeah, but they didn't have anything that was really meant for the hardcore gamer though

46:20.720 --> 46:21.720
with Kinect.

46:21.720 --> 46:24.320
And isn't that the mistake Nintendo made four years ago?

46:24.320 --> 46:25.320
It is.

46:25.320 --> 46:27.000
As recent as last year?

46:27.000 --> 46:32.500
It's possibly that way, but they may be relying more on third parties to kind of do that stuff.

46:32.500 --> 46:36.420
But the problem is they've got the hardcore audience right now.

46:36.420 --> 46:39.700
They're not trying to bring in more people necessarily.

46:39.700 --> 46:40.880
They have the hardcore gamers.

46:40.880 --> 46:44.280
They don't need to worry about the hardcore gamers leaving because there's no Kinect games

46:44.280 --> 46:45.280
for them.

46:45.280 --> 46:49.400
They're trying to bring on the casual audience that's not playing the Xbox 360 right now.

46:49.400 --> 46:53.320
I still kind of think, and I know some folks may argue with me and so forth because, you

46:53.320 --> 46:57.100
know, the press conferences are for everybody and it's so that they can get the coverage

46:57.100 --> 46:58.100
and so forth.

46:58.100 --> 46:59.720
But I'm like, but this is E3.

46:59.720 --> 47:00.720
You know what I mean?

47:00.720 --> 47:06.380
Like, you know, even CNN who's covering E3 sends their tech guys who play a lot of video

47:06.380 --> 47:07.880
games to E3.

47:07.880 --> 47:10.600
And I don't think there is on the up and up on a lot of this stuff.

47:10.600 --> 47:15.080
I mean, if Xbox wants to show off a lot of these Kinect things, I mean, I understand

47:15.080 --> 47:18.680
why it's a big part of the press conference, but some of these games could have been relegated

47:18.680 --> 47:22.360
to, you know, being debuted on the Ellen show or something for the appropriate audience.

47:22.360 --> 47:23.360
You know what I mean?

47:23.360 --> 47:27.600
I just feel like it's not just the one versus a hundred thing, but a lot, I mean, no mention

47:27.600 --> 47:34.040
of game room, which really doesn't surprise me, sadly, or just any other big holiday hardcore

47:34.040 --> 47:40.320
titles that we didn't already know about was a little disappointing to me.

47:40.320 --> 47:44.160
Honestly, I think it would have been better if they never announced Gears 3 a couple months

47:44.160 --> 47:45.160
ago.

47:45.160 --> 47:46.160
I think they should have kept it under wraps.

47:46.160 --> 47:54.200
I don't think there was any advantage to them blowing that on the Jimmy Kimmel show or whatever,

47:54.200 --> 47:57.400
no, the Jimmy Fallon show or whatever show it first showed up on.

47:57.400 --> 48:03.440
Yeah, I understand that, but at the same time, you know, like I said, their focus with Kinect

48:03.440 --> 48:06.040
is not necessarily the hardcore gamers.

48:06.040 --> 48:09.440
They've already got them with, you know, the stuff that they have coming out.

48:09.440 --> 48:14.120
And there will be stuff later on that will support the hardcore gamer crowd, but it should

48:14.120 --> 48:17.240
just not going to be the launch stuff.

48:17.240 --> 48:20.960
It's mainly just, you know, more of the casual audience that they're trying to capture in

48:20.960 --> 48:24.560
and then, you know, maybe they'll convert some of the hardcore gamers over later on

48:24.560 --> 48:28.080
to trying that stuff.

48:28.080 --> 48:29.960
And so there's a lot of stuff that they show off there.

48:29.960 --> 48:37.280
Obviously, you've got your Wii Sports clone, your Wii Sports Resort type thing with Kinect

48:37.280 --> 48:41.880
Adventures, Kinect Sports, seriously, Kinect Sports, couldn't you have done something a

48:41.880 --> 48:42.880
little bit different?

48:42.880 --> 48:49.640
Call it Kinect Athletics or something like that, you know, it's just so much of a, almost

48:49.640 --> 48:52.800
a rip-off, you know.

48:52.800 --> 48:57.040
But again, as much as I'm sitting here going, boo press conference, then I got up there

48:57.040 --> 49:01.280
and played Dance Central and I was like, okay, it's kind of fun, I got to admit, it's...

49:01.280 --> 49:03.600
But yeah, that's more of a casual game though.

49:03.600 --> 49:04.600
What's that, DarkSaga?

49:04.600 --> 49:09.780
I'm looking at this picture that Tiger Claw linked from Go Nintendo of Miyamoto checking

49:09.780 --> 49:14.040
out Kinect.

49:14.040 --> 49:15.840
And does he look kind of pissed?

49:15.840 --> 49:18.600
He looks sour.

49:18.600 --> 49:23.960
That could just be a bad freeze frame though, you know, how like a video is what, like 30

49:23.960 --> 49:25.240
pictures a second, you know?

49:25.240 --> 49:26.240
Yeah.

49:26.240 --> 49:27.600
And I still think it's kind of funny.

49:27.600 --> 49:28.840
It is funny.

49:28.840 --> 49:33.200
I'd like to see somebody make a comic out of that.

49:33.200 --> 49:36.920
And what I was going to say, some of the stuff that they did show that's kind of borderline

49:36.920 --> 49:42.400
on the hardcore games that they showed, like integration or possible integration with Forza.

49:42.400 --> 49:45.680
And to me, that looked just kind of dumb.

49:45.680 --> 49:49.960
I mean, okay, look, with Kinect, you can look around a car, like a virtual car and look

49:49.960 --> 49:52.200
at different stuff on the car.

49:52.200 --> 49:53.520
I don't care.

49:53.520 --> 49:57.280
Or you can drive, you know, by holding your hands in the air like a steering wheel.

49:57.280 --> 50:02.760
My arms would get tired, especially, you know, gamers out there, we're not in the best shape

50:02.760 --> 50:05.160
and that's going to be, you know...

50:05.160 --> 50:07.720
Didn't Joyride look like Excite Truck to you though?

50:07.720 --> 50:08.720
No.

50:08.720 --> 50:11.040
Joyride totally looked like Excite Truck to me.

50:11.040 --> 50:13.480
I mean, I guess the colors and stuff are the same.

50:13.480 --> 50:16.680
I heard Joyride was on rails, someone was saying.

50:16.680 --> 50:17.680
Was it?

50:17.680 --> 50:18.680
I don't know.

50:18.680 --> 50:19.680
I didn't play it at all.

50:19.680 --> 50:21.640
I looked like they were doing the tricks and jumping through rings and stuff that really

50:21.640 --> 50:22.680
reminded me of Excite Truck.

50:22.680 --> 50:25.160
And what happened to Joyride being a free game?

50:25.160 --> 50:26.160
Hello?

50:26.160 --> 50:31.040
It was supposed to be a free game on Xbox Live Arcade and then with paid download content

50:31.040 --> 50:35.440
and stuff, it was supposed to be a whole new different experiment and they just set aside

50:35.440 --> 50:37.880
and yeah, you know what, we're just going to charge $60 for it.

50:37.880 --> 50:39.520
That game is not worth $60.

50:39.520 --> 50:43.520
Maybe it'll be a pack-in game with the Kinect, because a lot of folks are speculating Kinect

50:43.520 --> 50:49.840
is $150 right now, which is fine, but I mean, if you have to buy a game separately, then

50:49.840 --> 50:53.040
aren't you really paying $210 to play a game on Kinect?

50:53.040 --> 50:58.400
It's the same thing if you even talk about, like, look at the bundles that they have right

50:58.400 --> 51:03.080
now for the PlayStation Move.

51:03.080 --> 51:09.860
You can get a bundle that comes with the Move controller, the camera, and a game for $130.

51:09.860 --> 51:14.600
And that's not including the extra controller that you need for some of the other games,

51:14.600 --> 51:23.120
kind of the nunchuck for the Move type thing, which you don't necessarily need, but come

51:23.120 --> 51:24.120
on.

51:24.120 --> 51:27.600
You're going to need it if you're going to want to be able to play everything out there.

51:27.600 --> 51:28.720
It's the same argument, both.

51:28.720 --> 51:29.960
It's just perception.

51:29.960 --> 51:33.040
You know what, I see Dark Soccer kind of looking at pictures over there, and it kind of reminds

51:33.040 --> 51:38.000
me, one of the games I would have liked to have seen them demo on the expo floor, I mean,

51:38.000 --> 51:41.480
I'm sorry, not the expo floor, but at the press conference as opposed to some of these,

51:41.480 --> 51:46.080
you know, Wii game rip-offs that they were demoing, is the Child of Eden game.

51:46.080 --> 51:47.080
That would have been cool.

51:47.080 --> 51:49.460
I've been looking at pictures from it.

51:49.460 --> 51:51.460
That's one thing that would have made me a little happier, is to bring out this new chip.

51:51.460 --> 51:52.960
See, that's more like a hardcore game.

51:52.960 --> 51:53.960
Yes, exactly.

51:53.960 --> 51:56.640
Why waste my time with Wii Sports clones?

51:56.640 --> 51:59.320
We all know you're going to rip off the Wii, quit wasting my time.

51:59.320 --> 52:01.120
That's just pretty.

52:01.120 --> 52:06.280
I think they should have shown the Child of Eden demo, but maybe it wasn't ready or whatever.

52:06.280 --> 52:10.880
I'm just absolutely, look, the fail whale made an appearance.

52:10.880 --> 52:13.600
I think a lot of times, though, with these demos, they're really nervous about things

52:13.600 --> 52:14.600
going wrong.

52:14.600 --> 52:16.400
Like, the things have to be exactly perfect.

52:16.400 --> 52:20.280
Case in point, what happened with the Zelda demonstration at Nintendo's press conference.

52:20.280 --> 52:22.360
They were having a lot of problems.

52:22.360 --> 52:24.840
And what's funny is that was the first thing, I don't mean to skip ahead, but that was the

52:24.840 --> 52:27.720
first thing Nintendo was showing at their press conference, and it started to make a

52:27.720 --> 52:34.000
lot of us go, here we go, in Nintendo's fail conference 2010, and then Reggie just kind

52:34.000 --> 52:38.840
of was like, you know, we'll get into that in a minute, but definitely the tone changed

52:38.840 --> 52:39.840
quickly.

52:39.840 --> 52:43.440
What did you think of yourself, fitness on the Kinect?

52:43.440 --> 52:44.440
I thought that was kind of neat.

52:44.440 --> 52:46.040
I think that's Kinect's biggest strength.

52:46.040 --> 52:50.360
I think that's where Kinect stands to make a lot of money right now, and if they're smart,

52:50.360 --> 52:55.120
they're gonna do tie-ins with the Biggest Loser TV show, and some of these exercise

52:55.120 --> 52:56.120
platforms.

52:56.120 --> 52:57.480
They do have a Biggest Loser game coming.

52:57.480 --> 53:00.000
I know, and who called it, here on the show?

53:00.000 --> 53:04.400
And you were like, no, they already have a Biggest Loser game.

53:04.400 --> 53:05.680
I'm a games analyst.

53:05.680 --> 53:12.440
Anyway, all joking aside, I think the exercise gaming is gonna be Kinect's biggest strength,

53:12.440 --> 53:14.560
and I think, is where they should go with it.

53:14.560 --> 53:17.760
Get off the couch, fatty, play some Kinect.

53:17.760 --> 53:23.480
Other things that they had, you know, out of the conference, let's see, Fable 3.

53:23.480 --> 53:25.960
I could care less about Fable 3.

53:25.960 --> 53:30.480
Basically, Fable 3 to me, you could have just shown me footage from Fable 2, it would have

53:30.480 --> 53:31.480
looked the same.

53:31.480 --> 53:34.520
I played what they had available on the show floor.

53:34.520 --> 53:37.720
I didn't understand what the hell was going on, because it was kind of in the middle of

53:37.720 --> 53:39.120
a quest already.

53:39.120 --> 53:41.920
I noticed that the little golden trails were still there telling you what to do, and you

53:41.920 --> 53:45.400
still had the dog, and then the particular quest I was doing, you got to put on a big

53:45.400 --> 53:49.040
chicken suit, and I guess round-up chickens, and I was amused by the fact that you were

53:49.040 --> 53:53.000
in a chicken suit, but yes, otherwise, I really didn't see anything that felt different to

53:53.000 --> 53:55.920
me than Fable 2.

53:55.920 --> 54:00.200
But hold on, I do want to say, I mean, you make it sound like Fable 2 is a bad game though.

54:00.200 --> 54:04.640
I think a lot of people will be perfectly content if Fable 3 is just more Fable 2, because

54:04.640 --> 54:05.640
it was a great game.

54:05.640 --> 54:07.640
I got bored with it after a while.

54:07.640 --> 54:11.720
Okay, one of the coolest trailers I thought that they showed during the whole Microsoft

54:11.720 --> 54:17.320
press conference was for Metal Gear Solid Rising, where you can cut things pretty much

54:17.320 --> 54:18.960
wherever you want.

54:18.960 --> 54:19.960
That was awesome.

54:19.960 --> 54:20.960
Absolutely awesome.

54:20.960 --> 54:27.680
I can get behind a game like that.

54:27.680 --> 54:32.680
Other cool things, you know, Reach, they were talking a little bit about some of the single

54:32.680 --> 54:36.200
player campaign, they showed some footage from that, it looks really epic, and now they're

54:36.200 --> 54:39.440
going to have space dog fighting and stuff like that, that'll be pretty cool.

54:39.440 --> 54:44.880
You know, going to be a great game, of course.

54:44.880 --> 54:52.360
I don't know, other than that, I'm trying to think of what else they really showed.

54:52.360 --> 54:56.400
They didn't really talk too much about Xbox Live Arcade either, I don't think.

54:56.400 --> 55:00.080
Well there's a Summer of Arcade promo they're doing that has a lot of high profile games,

55:00.080 --> 55:05.120
like the Hydro Thunder I believe is a part of that, and the Hydrophobia I think is in

55:05.120 --> 55:08.480
there too in the Castlevania game that we talked about a little earlier.

55:08.480 --> 55:11.400
You know, that's back, and that's kind of where Arcade's going.

55:11.400 --> 55:14.940
I was personally disappointed in the lack of Game Room news, and I think just further

55:14.940 --> 55:18.620
cements the fact that I think Microsoft's already written it off, but I'll save that

55:18.620 --> 55:23.440
rant for another episode of OLR when they finally stop releasing content for Game Room.

55:23.440 --> 55:30.880
Yeah, I think that's about it, I want to say for, of course the new Xbox looks kind of

55:30.880 --> 55:35.440
sexy and stuff, you know, all the rumors are true of course, you know.

55:35.440 --> 55:41.240
Please America, Europe, Japan, everybody out there listening to the show, Canada, stop

55:41.240 --> 55:43.920
calling it the Xbox 360 slim.

55:43.920 --> 55:44.920
It's not slim.

55:44.920 --> 55:45.920
Have you seen it?

55:45.920 --> 55:49.040
Have you seen it next to the old Xbox 360?

55:49.040 --> 55:52.040
It's still fat.

55:52.040 --> 55:57.720
That's like saying like a guy who went from 300 pounds to 280 pounds is now skinny.

55:57.720 --> 56:00.440
I mean, they're still fluffy.

56:00.440 --> 56:02.880
And there's not that there's anything wrong with that, not that there's anything wrong

56:02.880 --> 56:07.640
with the new Xbox 360, but it is not slim.

56:07.640 --> 56:12.600
It's just the new Xbox 360, and the relaunch of the system we all knew was going to be

56:12.600 --> 56:13.920
happening when Kinect came out.

56:13.920 --> 56:18.160
Yeah, and it's smaller, it does have a Kinect port on it that's going to provide power to

56:18.160 --> 56:22.160
the Kinect sensor if you want to, otherwise if you have an old system you just use the

56:22.160 --> 56:29.080
AC adapter, and then of course, you know, it has the integrated GPU CPU into one chip

56:29.080 --> 56:33.720
and the internal 250 gigabyte hard drive, which I heard was actually, you can interchange

56:33.720 --> 56:37.640
it like the PlayStation one, but I'm not positive.

56:37.640 --> 56:41.600
That's what I'm hearing too, is that it's not as hard wired in there as the old drives

56:41.600 --> 56:42.600
were.

56:42.600 --> 56:46.360
But here's the thing, I don't think those systems are for the people who already own

56:46.360 --> 56:47.360
Xboxes.

56:47.360 --> 56:53.440
It's to piss off those of us that just bought an Xbox a few months ago, thank you, and you

56:53.440 --> 56:56.080
know, it's a push into the holiday season.

56:56.080 --> 57:01.080
And all it is, is basically just an upgrade to the current stuff that they have out there,

57:01.080 --> 57:04.440
and you bet your ass they're going to do another fucking price drop in the fourth quarter,

57:04.440 --> 57:06.840
so you might as well just wait.

57:06.840 --> 57:11.160
I mean, because seriously, they're going to do another price drop, I think they've already

57:11.160 --> 57:17.520
said that they're going to be doing something new towards the holidays, so just be patient.

57:17.520 --> 57:23.920
Alright, so anything else you want to say about Microsoft or Microsoft related stuff?

57:23.920 --> 57:24.920
Dark Sakura?

57:24.920 --> 57:28.320
She's going to be picking up a Kinect to shake her booty.

57:28.320 --> 57:29.320
That's fine.

57:29.320 --> 57:30.320
Alright, how about Nintendo?

57:30.320 --> 57:34.280
Let me give you my impression of Nintendo's press conference this year, because you know,

57:34.280 --> 57:37.640
Nintendo, everybody's expectations were very low for Nintendo.

57:37.640 --> 57:42.720
You know, everybody was expecting something more on the 3DS, but I think other than that,

57:42.720 --> 57:45.320
everybody kind of went in there with their expectations low, but it basically went something

57:45.320 --> 57:46.320
like this.

57:46.320 --> 57:52.520
Reggie Fils-Aime comes out on stage, hi, I'm Reggie Fils-Aime, prepare to have your minds

57:52.520 --> 57:53.960
fucking blown.

57:53.960 --> 57:58.000
Here's the new Zelda game we've been talking about for a little while, and now, here's

57:58.000 --> 58:03.360
a new Wii game, Kirby, here's a new Wii game, GoldenEye, who doesn't love GoldenEye?

58:03.360 --> 58:07.040
Here's a new Wii game, Donkey Kong Country, here's a new Wii game, I mean, he's just naming

58:07.040 --> 58:13.160
game after game after game after game, and then, oh, and by the way, the Wii is still

58:13.160 --> 58:17.600
selling well, all those reports about the people are not buying games for the Wii are

58:17.600 --> 58:20.440
bullshit, so don't you ever talk fucking bad about my system again.

58:20.440 --> 58:22.720
Here comes Iwata to tell you about the 3DS.

58:22.720 --> 58:27.800
That was basically what the press conference was, and then they talk about the 3DS, and

58:27.800 --> 58:28.800
it's real, y'all.

58:28.800 --> 58:34.560
I mean, having seen the thing in person now, I can tell you, it really does work.

58:34.560 --> 58:38.240
It's a pretty impressive piece of technology.

58:38.240 --> 58:43.240
Here's how I interpreted the press conference.

58:43.240 --> 58:46.840
The Zelda game came out, and they were showing off stuff, honestly, they should have just

58:46.840 --> 58:51.680
shown a trailer, because I could care less watching him try to play the damn Zelda game,

58:51.680 --> 58:53.720
and I do like the way it looks.

58:53.720 --> 58:58.480
It's kind of a cross between Wind Waker and Twilight Princess.

58:58.480 --> 59:05.480
I like how it's very colorful, it's got that kind of cel-shaded look to it, but it's still,

59:05.480 --> 59:06.480
you know...

59:06.480 --> 59:09.680
It looks like cel-shaded watercolor, you know?

59:09.680 --> 59:10.980
That's my take on it.

59:10.980 --> 59:16.440
It's more pastel-y, and less like toilet water filter that the last game had.

59:16.440 --> 59:21.560
Well, it looks like a Wii game, and not like, oh look, it's a GameCube game, or even a

59:21.560 --> 59:24.280
Nintendo 64 game, or something like that.

59:24.280 --> 59:26.600
So that's cool.

59:26.600 --> 59:30.200
The demonstration, though, they seriously needed to cut down that demonstration, because

59:30.200 --> 59:31.200
it was not exciting.

59:31.200 --> 59:32.200
It did go on a little long.

59:32.200 --> 59:33.200
It was long.

59:33.200 --> 59:36.120
But they know people are excited about Zelda, and that was one of the big things that everybody

59:36.120 --> 59:37.120
wanted to hear about.

59:37.120 --> 59:40.600
But, uh, sg100matt in our chatroom says, by the way, Reggie has gotten more and more chubby

59:40.600 --> 59:42.920
E.T.E.3, he hasn't been playing his Wii Fit.

59:42.920 --> 59:47.600
Dude, sg100matt, I would be careful, because Reggie will bring out some charts, and fuck

59:47.600 --> 59:49.600
your shit up if you decide to talk back.

59:49.600 --> 59:50.600
I'm sorry!

59:50.600 --> 59:54.880
I don't buy his, oh, people haven't, you know, been playing the Wii, you know, or people

59:54.880 --> 59:57.080
are playing the Wii, and all that stuff.

59:57.080 --> 59:58.200
Where's your data?

59:58.200 --> 01:00:00.720
You know, you coming out here and saying this, I don't buy it.

01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:02.200
You cited MPD figures.

01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:06.760
Yeah, MPD figures, they cover what games are selling.

01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:11.040
And yeah, I'm sure a lot of people are buying Super Mario Galaxy and that kind of stuff,

01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:17.120
but every other game, like, of other genres, like say, some of the hardcore games and whatnot,

01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:19.400
those are not selling well.

01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:24.960
And you know, I can't say that the whole system's a success, but it's definitely, certain genres

01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:28.120
are doing well, and certain ones are not.

01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:32.400
It's perhaps just because they don't have all, I don't think they have the hardcore

01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:33.400
demographic.

01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:38.200
They have kind of like the families playing the game, and you know, the people that are

01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:44.040
big Nintendo fanboys, you know, playing just the Nintendo products, and that's about it.

01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:47.680
I think a lot of folks in chat are wondering, because they know I'm a hardcore Kid Icarus

01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:52.400
fan from back in the day, like what I was thinking when that Project Sora thing happened.

01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:53.600
You can pretty much imagine it.

01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:54.760
My jaw was on the floor.

01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:58.840
I was like, you know, and then as they were announcing it, I was like, oh my god, this

01:00:58.840 --> 01:00:59.840
makes perfect sense.

01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:02.960
This is why they kept it such a big secret.

01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:04.540
The whole Kid Icarus thing made perfect sense.

01:01:04.540 --> 01:01:08.880
And it was really the defining moment of Nintendo's press conference for me, where I was like,

01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:11.120
oh my god, they're back, thank you.

01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:15.440
Whoever hid Kami under the rafters, and whoever put the Wii Vitality sensor somewhere far,

01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:18.040
far away, thank you so much.

01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:20.400
Mario Sports is kind of dumb.

01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:21.400
Played it.

01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:24.280
It's a kid's game.

01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:26.360
I wasn't a huge fan of it.

01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:30.480
I did think Wii Party was better than a lot of people are passing it off as, though.

01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:35.560
But the interesting thing is, my question is, if the 3DS is not coming out this holiday

01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:39.360
season, which I don't know, I kind of think it's not going to.

01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:40.360
I think it is.

01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:43.940
Well, I mean, and the one good reason I'm hearing for why it is coming out this holiday

01:01:43.940 --> 01:01:45.920
season, what else does Nintendo have?

01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:49.400
Because we know Zelda got pushed back to 2011, so what are the big releases?

01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:50.960
Goldeneye, that'll be a big title.

01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:51.960
Kirby, I think.

01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:53.480
Kirby, which was certainly worthy.

01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:57.560
Epic Mickey, so they're putting a lot of stock in a third-party title, but it's a worthy

01:01:57.560 --> 01:01:58.560
title.

01:01:58.560 --> 01:01:59.560
I did play a little bit of that, too.

01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:00.560
Looks very good.

01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:04.680
Wii Party, I think will be one that they really back this holiday season.

01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:10.720
I don't think it's for everybody, but I think it's kind of Mario Party a little more chopped

01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:16.680
up than just the full game for more short attention span folks.

01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:17.680
Kirby looked okay.

01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:22.440
I never really have been a big fan of Kirby, but I definitely like the style of the game.

01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:23.440
It's definitely unique.

01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:25.680
There's nothing out there like it.

01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:27.240
So that was kind of cool.

01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:31.280
Wii Party, I just kind of, my mind turned off during the whole, like, you know, Wii

01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:32.280
Party thing.

01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:33.280
I just don't care.

01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:34.280
It's fine.

01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:37.040
You play these little mini games, and what's funny is that one of them looks just like

01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:42.000
that rafting game they were showing in Microsoft's adventures thing, but it was funny.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:46.720
We played this boat stacking game where you had to stack people on a boat, and the size

01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:51.120
of the people was determined on how well you did in the mini game, and we, you know, Shane

01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:55.720
and I were getting competitive, and we were cracking up when all the people were falling

01:02:55.720 --> 01:02:56.720
off the boat.

01:02:56.720 --> 01:02:58.600
You know what's funny?

01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:02.760
Metroid Other M just kind of had to be on the same level as all these other games.

01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:06.440
I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm still really excited about that game, but there was so

01:03:06.440 --> 01:03:10.880
much for Nintendo to show that this year Metroid wasn't able to stand out like it did last

01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:11.880
year.

01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:15.080
Metroid Other M, and it's sad, like, with the people I'm talking to, don't really seem

01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:19.040
to understand how awesome this game is gonna be.

01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:24.360
I think it looks really, really cool, so it'll be interesting to see when that comes out.

01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:27.500
The new Donkey Kong game, I kind of like how they're going back to the old school stuff

01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:29.560
with that, and see, that's the thing.

01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:33.400
Even with, like, new Super Mario Brothers, you don't have to reinvent the wheel.

01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:36.600
Just put out a good, you know, game that's in that genre.

01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:43.000
You don't even have to, like, go, like, all brand new with it, just, you know, a new game.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:44.320
I played the new GoldenEye game.

01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:45.320
It's a lot of fun.

01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:47.720
I played this odd job and kept killing Shane with my hat.

01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:48.720
It was a lot of fun.

01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:49.720
Good times.

01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:50.720
You threw a shoe?

01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:51.720
Seriously?

01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:52.720
Who threw a shoe?

01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:53.720
It was fun.

01:03:53.720 --> 01:03:54.720
It was fun.

01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:57.720
I had a good time with GoldenEye.

01:03:57.720 --> 01:04:01.520
I'm trying to think what other cool stuff they were showing off.

01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:06.240
Epic Mickey, like, the demo that they did of that didn't, like, half of it didn't really

01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:07.700
impress me too much.

01:04:07.700 --> 01:04:10.960
The other half, though, was pretty cool with, like, the whole Steamboat Willie, like, kind

01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:11.960
of.

01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:14.560
Yeah, that part was my favorite, too, but what really kind of impressed me about Epic

01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:18.580
Mickey that actually surprised me a lot is that you can kind of play Mickey a little

01:04:18.580 --> 01:04:19.580
devious.

01:04:19.580 --> 01:04:24.000
Like, there was a stage that we were looking at during the demo where you get sent by one

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:30.980
of the characters to collect masks, and what you can do is you can go collect one mask,

01:04:30.980 --> 01:04:34.500
take it to him, and he'll say, okay, now get me two more, and what you can do is you go

01:04:34.500 --> 01:04:39.360
around to the back of the shop, use your thinner to break down the door so you can just go

01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:43.000
into the back of the shop, take that same mask you just turned in, then go back to the

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:47.200
front of the store and say, here's mask number two, and he'll go, hmm, I don't remember them

01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:50.020
coming in a set, but okay, and he'll give you credit.

01:04:50.020 --> 01:04:54.160
So you can play the game as kind of like Good Mickey or Bad Mickey, which really surprised

01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:57.760
me that you'd be able to do that in a Mickey Mouse game.

01:04:57.760 --> 01:04:58.760
You know what I mean?

01:04:58.760 --> 01:05:01.080
It's supposed to be like...

01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:02.080
Now here's the thing.

01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:03.080
Heart of Gold.

01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:06.540
Remember how they have like the concept art for Epic Mickey, and they have the really

01:05:06.540 --> 01:05:09.240
twisted, creepy-ass looking characters?

01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:10.240
Were any of them in there?

01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:13.800
Because it seems to me that they really like G-rated the whole damn thing.

01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:18.480
It's not as like cool and epic as it was before.

01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:20.320
Um, yes and no.

01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:24.180
I think a lot of that just wasn't in the demo they were showing on the show floor, but with

01:05:24.180 --> 01:05:30.140
the whole paint thinner angle, and the fact that Mickey can be deceptive, I think it could

01:05:30.140 --> 01:05:31.240
be in there.

01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:33.200
We just didn't see it at E3.

01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:38.400
I wouldn't lose hope on that front yet, Loki.

01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:41.840
As far as Nintendo goes, I do want to talk just a minute about the 3DS, because I know

01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:47.240
a lot of people are really curious about what the game, or what the system kind of feels

01:05:47.240 --> 01:05:49.040
like.

01:05:49.040 --> 01:05:53.520
Don't expect things to fly out at you, like in some of those commercials.

01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:57.160
Imagine you're kind of like looking out this window, or looking down a hallway that has

01:05:57.160 --> 01:05:59.680
depth that kind of goes in.

01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:01.880
That's what the 3DS kind of looks like.

01:06:01.880 --> 01:06:03.880
I don't know how they do the technology.

01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:06.520
I don't know if it's functioning on prisms is what I hear.

01:06:06.520 --> 01:06:11.120
No, it's basically, they've got a different layer on there that directs light to both

01:06:11.120 --> 01:06:12.120
your eyes.

01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:18.120
It's like, you know how interlaced TV works, how they have different lines that update

01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:19.120
every so often?

01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:23.800
Well imagine that, but vertical, and instead of it being updated differently, half of those

01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:28.360
lines are going to your right eye, half of those lines are going to your left eye.

01:06:28.360 --> 01:06:43.160
It's basically like, what do they call it, not lithograph, lenticular.

01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:47.500
Have you ever seen those boxes like for Saw, for example, the 3D one, or Final Destination

01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:48.500
3D.

01:06:48.500 --> 01:06:51.600
That one that they had where you look at it and it looks like the stuff's kind of popping

01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:57.200
out because they've got basically this piece of plastic that kind of has ridges on it that

01:06:57.200 --> 01:07:00.960
kind of acts like a prism and pushes it to your left eye and right eye.

01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:02.180
That's basically how it works.

01:07:02.180 --> 01:07:05.320
They focus the image to two different eyes.

01:07:05.320 --> 01:07:08.280
It's like the virtual boy, but less headache inducing.

01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:13.640
Well let me tell you though, the best thing, I noticed the pull on my eyes, and I was kind

01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:17.120
of like, okay this is not going to be a healthy thing for me to play for a couple hours.

01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:19.080
Here's the best thing about it.

01:07:19.080 --> 01:07:24.320
There's a slider that you can adjust the intensity of the 3D, and if the 3D gets too gimmicky

01:07:24.320 --> 01:07:26.560
and too dumb for you, you just turn it off.

01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:28.360
Presto change-o 2D.

01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:31.680
One of the cool things that I did see them announce when they were talking about the

01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:36.920
3DS is that they're going to have support from movie studios to put out 3D movies on

01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:37.920
that thing.

01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:38.920
Yes.

01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:39.920
That's a cool idea.

01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:42.960
One of the demos they were showing was Disney's Tangled, one of the movies, I guess it's out

01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:43.960
in theaters.

01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:48.840
The trailer, and that was some of the most impressive use of 3D they had.

01:07:48.840 --> 01:07:53.240
I was not seeing artifacting or anything on the screen, I mean it was only the top screen,

01:07:53.240 --> 01:07:59.080
didn't really use the bottom screen at all, but this will be great for kids.

01:07:59.080 --> 01:08:00.080
Even some adults too.

01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:03.600
I don't think they're talking about a lot of adult movies on the 3D technology yet,

01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:07.320
but certainly the kids stuff, I think there's going to be a lot of people very happy.

01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:11.720
And of course, the developers list, which I'm not sure if we're getting into later,

01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:15.880
but lots of cool stuff, you know, all the big games, Mario Kart and stuff.

01:08:15.880 --> 01:08:19.520
Wish they had a WarioWare game, you know, right there.

01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:23.200
Still, I mean, if you go by the golden rule of gaming, a system is only as good as the

01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:24.200
games that are on it.

01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:26.680
This thing has the games to back it up.

01:08:26.680 --> 01:08:29.320
The cartridges are different from the regular DS.

01:08:29.320 --> 01:08:32.680
The graphical power felt more like a Playstation 2 in there.

01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:34.120
I mean, not quite at that level.

01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:38.260
I don't think especially a lot of the rendering will be, but you know, like the Kingdom Hearts

01:08:38.260 --> 01:08:41.620
little demo I saw looked like the freaking game on the PS2.

01:08:41.620 --> 01:08:47.720
So you know, a lot of it is going to be pretty impressive and yeah, I mean, there's the games

01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:50.020
to back it up at the end of the day.

01:08:50.020 --> 01:08:53.640
It doesn't, it's not like the Playstation move where I can't think of a single game

01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:56.800
I really want to buy the move for.

01:08:56.800 --> 01:09:00.080
And Connect, I'm kind of teeter tottering, I'm like, well, I guess there's the two dance

01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:01.080
games.

01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:05.520
Connect, I'm actually planning on picking up and I actually kind of want to pick up

01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:10.160
like the Connect Adventures thing because I think that'd be a fun party game.

01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:13.120
The Dance Central stuff, I think that'd be pretty fun.

01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:17.120
The Fitness game, I'm not sure because, you know, I bought Wii Fit, I'm like, oh, I'm

01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:18.640
going to do that and stuff.

01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:25.640
It just, I need an excuse to work out, you know, but I don't know if I'd actually do

01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:26.640
that.

01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:29.360
It's just like, games like that make me feel like awkward, you know what I mean?

01:09:29.360 --> 01:09:33.120
Where it's like you can do something, I mean, playing DDR I guess would be kind of awkward

01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:37.200
looking too, but I never felt awkward playing the game, you know what I mean?

01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:39.200
So, I don't know.

01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:40.200
Alright.

01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:46.040
Let's move on, I guess, then to Sony, if we've kind of talked enough about 3DS and so forth.

01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:48.800
What did Sony do, Loki?

01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:54.920
Sony had, of course, their big thing was, they showed off the Move stuff and 3D.

01:09:54.920 --> 01:10:01.560
3D was the big thing for them, of course they were talking about partners with third party

01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:03.600
companies for different 3D things.

01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:09.600
Now, it's a little deceptive in how they were talking about 3D, because certain games like

01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:18.000
Crysis 2 will not only be 3D on the Playstation platform, they will be 3D also on the Xbox

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:19.800
360 as well.

01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:23.800
Not all games, though, I think were going to be 3D, but as one of their big focus, obviously

01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:31.080
the 3D Blu-Ray is going to be available with a firmware update, which that is pretty cool

01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:36.320
because if you don't have it, you would have to actually buy a whole new Blu-Ray player.

01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:42.600
Also, they were showing off some new games, different franchises, like Twisted Metal was

01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:46.800
one of the big ones that they announced, which is kind of cool, Motorstorm Apocalypse, which

01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:50.840
I think looks pretty fun.

01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:54.740
Little Big Planet 2, I got some hands on time with on the show floor, and the level we were

01:10:54.740 --> 01:10:59.820
playing was a race level, but it introduced the grappling hook, and not only could you

01:10:59.820 --> 01:11:04.280
grapple on certain parts of the scenery, but you could grapple the other players, and that

01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:05.280
made it a lot of fun.

01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:06.640
We had a lot of fun with that.

01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:10.960
Otherwise, stylistically, it really just looks like the first game, and graphically, but

01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:15.960
this upgrade is really more about the extra tools that are in it than anything else, which

01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:16.960
I think most people do.

01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:20.360
I do like how you can have good control over everything, how you can make puzzle games

01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:27.060
and top-down action games or whatever, RPGs, that's pretty cool.

01:11:27.060 --> 01:11:31.840
So it'll be interesting to see what levels are created by that, because I know I'm pretty

01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:37.000
creative, but I just don't have time to do it, so thankfully there's a community of millions

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:41.880
of players out there to do it for me, so yeah.

01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:44.380
I don't know, there wasn't a lot at Sony's press conference that really made me jump

01:11:44.380 --> 01:11:47.080
up and down and scream, except for Kevin Butler coming on stage.

01:11:47.080 --> 01:11:48.080
That was awesome.

01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:50.880
I know it makes me kitty.

01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:52.080
What's that?

01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:53.440
The P word.

01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:54.640
The P word?

01:11:54.640 --> 01:11:57.720
The second of the P words.

01:11:57.720 --> 01:11:58.720
You lost me.

01:11:58.720 --> 01:11:59.720
Portal 2.

01:11:59.720 --> 01:12:05.120
Ah, Portal 2, of course, how could we forget, that was the big ending to Sony's press conference

01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:11.080
where Valve is basically saying, oh yeah, yeah, I guess we will make stuff for the PlayStation

01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:12.080
3 after all.

01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:15.280
That's basically what it was, like, we'll stop ignoring you.

01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:21.000
But I think even more so than just the fact that Portal 2 is coming out for the system,

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:25.680
is more the fact that Steam is going to have some integration with the PS3.

01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:29.200
That was the biggest newsworthy thing to me.

01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:31.000
Did you see the trailer for Portal 2?

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:32.040
I sure did.

01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:33.040
You monster.

01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:34.040
I know.

01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:39.600
But now, I've watched, and we were actually able to, you know, we've got our TV out front

01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:46.120
with a computer hooked up to it so we can watch YouTube videos at the high res, and

01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:53.400
we watched the playthrough demonstrations, and that was really exciting.

01:12:53.400 --> 01:13:02.280
But there was also an interview that G4 had up with one of the designers talking about

01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:08.800
the story that, you know, you didn't escape, it's in the future, the far future, and you're

01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:09.800
still there.

01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:10.800
Oops.

01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:20.240
They're actually in the playtesting part for both of the storylines, but there's two stories

01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:21.240
going on.

01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:25.000
One is strictly for single player, and the other is for cooperative play.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:28.920
So instead of cooperative being a tackline, cooperative has its own story.

01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:29.920
I noticed that.

01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:30.920
I thought that was pretty cool.

01:13:30.920 --> 01:13:32.160
And it makes sense for a game like Portal.

01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:35.880
It would be very hard to integrate them both in the same game.

01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:40.080
But by the way, just in case it hasn't already been mentioned or you didn't hear, you know

01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:43.160
why that Portal 2 party got cancelled after all?

01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:45.360
It wasn't because Valve wanted to show something else out.

01:13:45.360 --> 01:13:48.720
They were going to announce the PlayStation thing at that party.

01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:55.520
But Sony came to them and said, you know, basically in so many words, um, actually,

01:13:55.520 --> 01:13:59.060
could you wait and come out on stage at our press conference?

01:13:59.060 --> 01:14:02.760
That's why no Portal 2 event happened.

01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:06.440
Killzone 3 looked awesome, and I can only imagine what that looks like in 3D.

01:14:06.440 --> 01:14:09.400
So that was kind of cool.

01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:14.640
The PlayStation Move stuff, I just couldn't get too excited about what they were showing.

01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:19.340
I know it's going to have support for SOCOM 4 and stuff like that, and I know that they

01:14:19.340 --> 01:14:25.320
have a new Time Crisis game, which, by the way, never forget that they did come out with

01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:28.200
a gun con for the Time Crisis game.

01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:30.920
What a waste of money that was.

01:14:30.920 --> 01:14:32.640
Thank you, Namco!

01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:36.580
Did you hear though that the Time Crisis game, there's going to be a mode that's off rails?

01:14:36.580 --> 01:14:39.200
I'm like, that's not Time Crisis!

01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:40.200
They had that in the last one.

01:14:40.200 --> 01:14:41.200
Did they really?

01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:42.200
Yeah.

01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:43.200
I didn't know that.

01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:46.000
But see, the gun con in the last one was actually pretty cool, because they did have, you know,

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:51.100
the kind of a dual grip for it, and they had, you know, one analog stick on your left hand

01:14:51.100 --> 01:14:54.120
where you'd be holding it in the front of the gun, and the right analog, you know, in

01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:55.120
the back of the gun.

01:14:55.120 --> 01:14:58.720
And actually that worked really well for first-person shooters, except it was the only game that

01:14:58.720 --> 01:15:00.400
used that, which is really sad.

01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:05.400
They didn't even really need Move, they could have done it with this thing, but whatever.

01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:10.300
So they've got a, you know, new Time Crisis game, and whoopty shit.

01:15:10.300 --> 01:15:12.240
Where the hell did The Last Guardian go?

01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:15.880
That was one of the big standouts from last year, and it just kind of disappeared, didn't

01:15:15.880 --> 01:15:16.880
it?

01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:19.080
Yeah, they didn't mention anything, but it's supposed to be still coming out.

01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:20.800
Hmm, I found that to be a little strange.

01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:23.520
Maybe it was just me, but I was very disappointed.

01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:26.000
Still on my list for November.

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:27.000
Interesting.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:30.320
I like how Gran Turismo 5 has a date again.

01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:35.040
Let's see if they actually hit that date this time.

01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:36.040
We'll see.

01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:39.160
Alright, so I guess we're done with press conferences.

01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:42.640
Let's kind of go around and see what everybody's- oh, you have something else you want to add?

01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:45.960
No, I want to talk about some of the other smaller press conferences real quick.

01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:46.960
Sure, sure.

01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:47.960
Please do.

01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:48.960
Just make a quick mention.

01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:55.660
While they didn't show the Vitality sensor, Ubisoft had their sort of Vitality sensor

01:15:55.660 --> 01:15:57.240
game, I guess.

01:15:57.240 --> 01:16:01.040
It wasn't really called a Vitality sensor, I forget what they were calling it, but it

01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:06.640
was like a breathing, relaxing game or something, which I thought was funny, because I wonder

01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:11.040
if that, you know, you would think that they aren't actually coming out of the Vitality

01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:18.720
sensor now, since that thing basically is the Vitality sensor, and that, you know, Nintendo

01:16:18.720 --> 01:16:21.100
would be suing them, if that were the case.

01:16:21.100 --> 01:16:22.100
So that was interesting.

01:16:22.100 --> 01:16:26.760
They showed a lot of games that weren't really games, like they had a PC laser tag game,

01:16:26.760 --> 01:16:29.000
but all the PC did was basically keep score.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:34.560
It was actually, you know, a real laser tag, like, pack and crap that you bought and put

01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:37.480
on and went and shot your friends and stuff like that.

01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:41.160
And Joel McHale looked really awkward hosting the Ubisoft thing.

01:16:41.160 --> 01:16:42.560
The new Rayman game looks awesome.

01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:43.800
Have you seen that?

01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:45.560
The episodic one?

01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:51.560
It's just- it's all really pretty hand-drawn and just really awesome.

01:16:51.560 --> 01:16:57.720
And then the last one that they showed, which also was kind of weird, and they were- it

01:16:57.720 --> 01:17:05.400
was funny because they were saying it wasn't really a game, was Mania Planet, which, you

01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:09.280
know, I'm kind of a fan of the Track Mania series, but they're going to be having two

01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:13.360
new PC titles that are going to be able- you're going to be able to make your own custom games

01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:15.000
out of.

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:19.320
Shoot Mania, which is going to be like a first-person shooter kind of editor, creator type thing,

01:17:19.320 --> 01:17:24.440
and RPG Mania, which you'll be able to make your own RPG Mania- or your RPG type games.

01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:28.360
And of course, a new Track Mania game that's going to be coming out, which looks very pretty,

01:17:28.360 --> 01:17:31.920
so those are pretty cool.

01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:33.320
That's pretty much it for right now.

01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:34.320
Alright.

01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:35.320
Let's go around.

01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:39.840
I just kind of want to get everybody's thoughts on the, you know, in your opinion, the best

01:17:39.840 --> 01:17:46.220
thing about E3, and the worst thing about E3, I'll start.

01:17:46.220 --> 01:17:49.960
The best thing about E3 was by far the 3DS.

01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:55.500
I mean, just actually getting to see it and use it and behold, this new piece of technology

01:17:55.500 --> 01:17:58.640
was really something else, even if the lines the first day were pretty ugly, but they got

01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:00.700
a little more manageable as the show went on.

01:18:00.700 --> 01:18:03.080
So obviously the best thing was by far the 3DS.

01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:09.080
Worst thing about E3 was flaky flakes like Activision and Blizzard, you know, being under

01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:12.200
the same umbrella, just not even- deciding they don't even need a booth anymore.

01:18:12.200 --> 01:18:16.140
I realized they had their own off event, I realized they think they're at a level where

01:18:16.140 --> 01:18:21.740
they can just not put up with the show of E3, but I just- I don't know, it's kind of-

01:18:21.740 --> 01:18:22.740
I get-

01:18:22.740 --> 01:18:23.740
Sounds tacky.

01:18:23.740 --> 01:18:24.740
It's a little tacky to me.

01:18:24.740 --> 01:18:28.040
I mean, they're kind of reeking of that kid who takes the ball and goes home because they

01:18:28.040 --> 01:18:29.240
don't like the rules of the game.

01:18:29.240 --> 01:18:32.320
You know, it's just- it's unfortunate, I think.

01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:36.580
And just the fact that Blizzard will not show anything at E3, because basically they can

01:18:36.580 --> 01:18:41.680
charge people $150 who will go see it at their own convention, and then the tickets get scalped

01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:47.400
on eBay, so basically people are really paying like $400 to go see these demos of games they're

01:18:47.400 --> 01:18:49.600
going to end up buying regardless anyway.

01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:54.080
Personally, I think BlizzCon is a big fat joke, but I guess I'll save that rant for

01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:56.720
another edition of OLR.

01:18:56.720 --> 01:18:57.720
So.

01:18:57.720 --> 01:19:01.000
Anyhow, best and worst of E3.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:02.000
Loki?

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:07.500
I kind of have to agree with the Activision thing, just because I wish there was more

01:19:07.500 --> 01:19:10.200
coverage of the Activision games.

01:19:10.200 --> 01:19:14.400
To me, and you were mentioning BlizzCon and stuff, a lot of the stuff that Activision

01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:21.880
does seems like a cash grab, and believe me, if they had thought about the whole charging

01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:27.400
people for online play and when you buy a used game first, they would have been doing

01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:28.880
it first.

01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:32.280
And I have a feeling they're going to be following suit with that because they can make a lot

01:19:32.280 --> 01:19:35.640
of money off of those Call of Duty games, Black Ops and whatnot.

01:19:35.640 --> 01:19:41.660
Speaking of which, Black Ops looked fucking awesome, or no, it wasn't Black Ops, Future

01:19:41.660 --> 01:19:45.360
Warrior actually, they were showing off the new Ghost Recon game, it looked awesome, and

01:19:45.360 --> 01:19:49.960
the Ubisoft thing, I mean, really cool.

01:19:49.960 --> 01:19:54.560
One of the best moments of E3 I think was when Kevin Butler came on stage and did his

01:19:54.560 --> 01:19:56.360
like little rant.

01:19:56.360 --> 01:19:57.900
That was actually really cool.

01:19:57.900 --> 01:19:59.440
Completely scripted, well-acted rant.

01:19:59.440 --> 01:20:00.440
I don't care.

01:20:00.440 --> 01:20:03.800
He's a great actor, he's funny, you know.

01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:08.320
I have no problems with, you know, I understand he's not a real, I mean, he's a real person

01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:11.720
but he's playing, you know, this character, and that's fine.

01:20:11.720 --> 01:20:15.840
I think it's a great, you know, advertising ploy.

01:20:15.840 --> 01:20:16.840
So that was really cool.

01:20:16.840 --> 01:20:21.360
You know what's funny, I was talking to Bobby about this one of the nights, and Shane was

01:20:21.360 --> 01:20:24.240
probably there too, we were talking about this.

01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:28.240
Many years ago here on the show, well maybe a couple years ago, I kind of said one of

01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:31.920
the problems Sony's having right now is that they don't really have a good voice.

01:20:31.920 --> 01:20:37.240
Xbox 360 has Major Nelson, Nintendo has Reggie Fils-Aime, but who does Sony have?

01:20:37.240 --> 01:20:41.960
Sony has not really had a spokesperson, but they sure do now, don't they?

01:20:41.960 --> 01:20:43.760
My how a lot has changed in a year.

01:20:43.760 --> 01:20:46.760
It seems to me like the Stephen Colbert of the video game world.

01:20:46.760 --> 01:20:47.760
I'm sorry.

01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:48.760
Yes.

01:20:48.760 --> 01:20:51.120
I need to retract my Activision thing.

01:20:51.120 --> 01:20:52.960
Activision was not the worst part.

01:20:52.960 --> 01:20:55.720
And sadly enough it does tie in with Kevin Butler.

01:20:55.720 --> 01:20:59.120
Who the fuck is this new kid pimping out the PSP stuff?

01:20:59.120 --> 01:21:01.800
He is so fucking annoying.

01:21:01.800 --> 01:21:05.680
Why would you even have someone else handling that when you have Kevin Butler?

01:21:05.680 --> 01:21:10.640
It's like, hey look, we have this fine caviar, but instead we're gonna serve you dog shit

01:21:10.640 --> 01:21:11.640
on a plate.

01:21:11.640 --> 01:21:14.080
I mean, why would you do that?

01:21:14.080 --> 01:21:18.240
Why would you, you're going backwards, you took a big step backwards with this kid.

01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:22.760
At the end of the day, they still eat crayons, Kevin Butler or not, remember that.

01:21:22.760 --> 01:21:23.800
Sony's still eating crayons.

01:21:23.800 --> 01:21:26.960
I understand, but seriously, what the hell?

01:21:26.960 --> 01:21:29.880
Rob, you gotta admit, the kid wears the bicycle helmet.

01:21:29.880 --> 01:21:33.440
And then they played like two commercials with him in it, and I'm like, stop.

01:21:33.440 --> 01:21:36.080
I already hate him already.

01:21:36.080 --> 01:21:37.080
And that's to be redundant.

01:21:37.080 --> 01:21:38.080
SSJ100MattInOurChat.

01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:39.080
That's terrible.

01:21:39.080 --> 01:21:40.080
Exactly right.

01:21:40.080 --> 01:21:41.080
Chat.

01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:45.480
ThatOrangeLawnTrader.com says, seriously, think of the games they could have shown instead

01:21:45.480 --> 01:21:50.200
of Kevin Butler's rant, but it was an epic time killing moment.

01:21:50.200 --> 01:21:53.440
ToaGak believes that dog shit is actually better than caviar.

01:21:53.440 --> 01:21:56.020
All right, fine.

01:21:56.020 --> 01:22:00.860
We can serve you filet mignon, wrapped in bacon, the most delicious food you could possibly

01:22:00.860 --> 01:22:04.240
ever have, or a steaming pile of dog shit.

01:22:04.240 --> 01:22:11.040
In fact, we'll just put the dog over your face and he can shit straight into your mouth.

01:22:11.040 --> 01:22:13.200
So it's absolutely fresh.

01:22:13.200 --> 01:22:15.240
Loki, we get it.

01:22:15.240 --> 01:22:16.240
God.

01:22:16.240 --> 01:22:18.160
I don't think you do.

01:22:18.160 --> 01:22:20.920
Well, I'm done with that.

01:22:20.920 --> 01:22:23.240
This dog has been constipated forever.

01:22:23.240 --> 01:22:26.960
Don't make me bring out the Dalek.

01:22:26.960 --> 01:22:28.080
Dark Sakura, please.

01:22:28.080 --> 01:22:31.600
The best thing about E3 for you and the worst thing about E3 for you.

01:22:31.600 --> 01:22:38.000
It's a combination of getting my little bit of Portal 2 crack, because you know I've been

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:39.680
waiting for that.

01:22:39.680 --> 01:22:43.600
And did they say anything about Half-Life 3?

01:22:43.600 --> 01:22:48.400
That's what I wanted to ask.

01:22:48.400 --> 01:22:49.400
You're funny.

01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:51.580
Valve, acknowledging Half-Life.

01:22:51.580 --> 01:22:52.580
That's funny.

01:22:52.580 --> 01:22:54.680
No, they didn't.

01:22:54.680 --> 01:23:02.040
Anyway, and the other good thing would be Kid Icarus with the 3DS.

01:23:02.040 --> 01:23:03.420
So yay.

01:23:03.420 --> 01:23:07.520
And the worst thing is there was no me there.

01:23:07.520 --> 01:23:08.520
That was pretty awful.

01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:09.520
I'm sorry.

01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:12.720
So I couldn't have my Epic running into Kojima, but he wasn't there anyway.

01:23:12.720 --> 01:23:15.000
That's why you couldn't go.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:21.160
It's a constant in the universe that every E3 that I go to, I have to run into Kojima.

01:23:21.160 --> 01:23:23.120
Literally.

01:23:23.120 --> 01:23:24.840
And you know what else is kind of dumb?

01:23:24.840 --> 01:23:27.120
Not quite the worst thing of E3.

01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:28.680
What are they doing with the PSP?

01:23:28.680 --> 01:23:31.120
Ooh, look, we have a new God of War game.

01:23:31.120 --> 01:23:32.120
Props to you.

01:23:32.120 --> 01:23:33.120
New God of War game.

01:23:33.120 --> 01:23:34.120
Awesome.

01:23:34.120 --> 01:23:37.440
They're still trying to kind of recover from that whole PSP Go debacle.

01:23:37.440 --> 01:23:40.640
I think Sony's gonna save that PSP 2 for next year.

01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:43.400
Guaranteed there'll be a PSP 2 next year.

01:23:43.400 --> 01:23:44.400
They're gonna have to.

01:23:44.400 --> 01:23:45.400
All right.

01:23:45.400 --> 01:23:47.280
They can't lose by much more.

01:23:47.280 --> 01:23:51.680
How about some release dates, because meanwhile while expos are going on, there's still games

01:23:51.680 --> 01:23:56.800
coming to a store near you, and we probably should acknowledge some of the upcoming releases.

01:23:56.800 --> 01:24:02.320
Yes, this week there's gonna be some Transformers.

01:24:02.320 --> 01:24:11.340
The Cybertron Wars will be coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, the Wii, and of course two versions

01:24:11.340 --> 01:24:17.760
on the DS, because they have to have one for every faction, and one on the PSP, one on

01:24:17.760 --> 01:24:19.760
the PC.

01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:23.080
Way too many Transformers, but that's fine.

01:24:23.080 --> 01:24:27.320
Also this week, crappy DS games, including Western Riding Academy.

01:24:27.320 --> 01:24:31.360
Awesome, because there's no horse riding games on the DS at all.

01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:37.400
TNA Cross the Line, that's gonna be coming out on PSP and DS this week.

01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:43.320
DS Sing, it's a karaoke game for the DS that comes with a microphone that plugs into your

01:24:43.320 --> 01:24:47.040
DS, so you can look like a tool on the subway.

01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:52.480
Ten Minute Solutions, coming from Activision, it's their fitness game based off a DVD exercise

01:24:52.480 --> 01:24:53.480
series.

01:24:53.480 --> 01:24:59.760
Wipeout, based off the, I guess it's a popular TV show on DS and Wii.

01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:00.760
Thank you Activision.

01:25:00.760 --> 01:25:06.840
Why can't they just have Takashi's Castle the game?

01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:13.240
I mean, I know they did way back in the day, but a new one, that would be kind of cool.

01:25:13.240 --> 01:25:16.440
Ah, the Wii, what junk you have.

01:25:16.440 --> 01:25:22.880
Calvin Tucker's Redneck Racing on the Wii, from Zoo Games, thank you very much.

01:25:22.880 --> 01:25:30.640
And some generic brain training games, Think Smart on DS, and then they also have Think

01:25:30.640 --> 01:25:37.880
Smart Kids on DS, and then that's also on the Wii.

01:25:37.880 --> 01:25:44.480
Let's see here, a couple more, Field and Stream, Total Outdoorsman Challenge on the Xbox 360,

01:25:44.480 --> 01:25:49.320
Puzzle Quest 2 on the DS, and that's gonna be the old school Puzzle Quest game, none

01:25:49.320 --> 01:25:54.600
of this crappy hexagon space Puzzle Quest crap.

01:25:54.600 --> 01:25:57.200
Play that at the show, it has a lot of new mini games too.

01:25:57.200 --> 01:25:58.200
Yes.

01:25:58.200 --> 01:26:02.400
And finally, an actual game from Nintendo, and kind of a cult classic, or soon to be

01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:06.200
a cult classic, Sin and Punishment Star Successor, coming out this week.

01:26:06.200 --> 01:26:08.440
Get it now, until it's gone, before it's gone.

01:26:08.440 --> 01:26:09.440
Yeah.

01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:10.440
So, that's it.

01:26:10.440 --> 01:26:13.480
If you want Nintendo to put out more titles like that, you might want to get it now.

01:26:13.480 --> 01:26:17.400
Although it does look like, I mean Nintendo's got a lot of, I guess you could say hardcore,

01:26:17.400 --> 01:26:20.320
quote unquote, games coming out for the rest of the year.

01:26:20.320 --> 01:26:23.560
Okay, some of the other games coming out in Japan.

01:26:23.560 --> 01:26:26.880
Big Week in Japan with this release, because I think this is definitely one we want to

01:26:26.880 --> 01:26:29.800
keep an eye on, because this looks like a pretty awesome game.

01:26:29.800 --> 01:26:35.200
Monster Hunter Frontier Online is coming out from Capcom in Japan on the Xbox 360 this

01:26:35.200 --> 01:26:37.360
week, so yes it is an online adventure.

01:26:37.360 --> 01:26:41.120
I would probably stop short of saying MMO, but you're gonna have 11 different types

01:26:41.120 --> 01:26:46.520
of weapons, and you'll be able to use the Xbox 360 live, basically, to go into a plaza,

01:26:46.520 --> 01:26:48.360
chat with other hunters for tips.

01:26:48.360 --> 01:26:52.360
Capcom's gonna be regularly updating the game, so keep an eye on that one.

01:26:52.360 --> 01:26:55.940
I bet if anybody's importing a game, that would be one of them.

01:26:55.940 --> 01:27:00.240
Sengoku Hime 2 is also coming out this week from SystemSoft, a little strategy game there

01:27:00.240 --> 01:27:05.440
featuring anime characters, that's a lot of the games in Japan end up being.

01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:09.640
There's also, by the way, a special new keyboard coming out for the Xbox 360 Monster Hunter

01:27:09.640 --> 01:27:12.680
game, so keep a look out for that.

01:27:12.680 --> 01:27:16.160
In other Japanese release dates, there are some games coming out on the Playstation 3

01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:17.160
as well.

01:27:17.160 --> 01:27:23.260
There's a game called White Album, Susarariu Fuyu no Omoide is coming out, and this is

01:27:23.260 --> 01:27:25.640
an adventure game.

01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:29.520
Basically your idol is your girlfriend, and the more popular she becomes, the less time

01:27:29.520 --> 01:27:31.720
she has for you.

01:27:31.720 --> 01:27:36.560
That's basically the plot of the game, conflicts, fight with your girlfriend, the game is basically

01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:37.560
what this is.

01:27:37.560 --> 01:27:38.560
So...

01:27:38.560 --> 01:27:39.560
Why would I buy a game?

01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:43.120
It's funny, if you buy a game like that, you might actually start the real life version

01:27:43.120 --> 01:27:45.800
of the game.

01:27:45.800 --> 01:27:52.000
Also a game coming out over there, Tottori no Atelier, Arland no Reckon Jushuchi 2 comes

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:53.000
out.

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:58.760
It's a sequel to Rona no Atelier, it takes place 10 years after that, it's an RPG.

01:27:58.760 --> 01:28:02.760
You have, you know, synthesis and go on swashbuckling adventures, etc. etc.

01:28:02.760 --> 01:28:06.440
It's a JRPG, in its finest.

01:28:06.440 --> 01:28:12.480
Going over to the Nintendo Wii, SD Gundam Gashapon Wars comes out this week.

01:28:12.480 --> 01:28:14.960
Aw, I love SD Gundam, they're so cute.

01:28:14.960 --> 01:28:18.640
There's also a version coming out with a classic controller, it should be stated, so check

01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:19.640
that out.

01:28:19.640 --> 01:28:22.640
By the way, Goldeneye, I played completely on a classic controller, that's how they were

01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:23.640
demoing it.

01:28:23.640 --> 01:28:26.560
I meant to get that out at some point.

01:28:26.560 --> 01:28:30.740
You don't have to use motion control at all in Goldeneye, the way it should be.

01:28:30.740 --> 01:28:35.640
On the Nintendo DS this week in Japan, Love Plus comes out this week, and there's like

01:28:35.640 --> 01:28:40.440
all these little play stands and things coming out to support it, but that's what it's called,

01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:43.520
it's called Love Plus.

01:28:43.520 --> 01:28:49.480
It's like a experienced school, and you go on vacations and mountain climbing with three

01:28:49.480 --> 01:28:52.720
girls and you date, it's another dating sim, okay guys?

01:28:52.720 --> 01:28:57.680
It's the one that's, you know, it's basically a sequel to the one that was like, you know,

01:28:57.680 --> 01:28:59.880
where the guy married the character in a bagel.

01:28:59.880 --> 01:29:01.680
Yes, it is, it is that same series.

01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:07.560
Also, if that's not enough for you, Tokimeki Memorial Girls' Side, third story, so if Love

01:29:07.560 --> 01:29:13.240
Plus is not for you, maybe you want to play the girls' side.

01:29:13.240 --> 01:29:16.520
It's basically where you are now the female lead and you're trying to get a boyfriend

01:29:16.520 --> 01:29:18.280
before graduation.

01:29:18.280 --> 01:29:20.660
So I like that, that they're both coming out the same week.

01:29:20.660 --> 01:29:24.680
You know, Rob, I have a laserdisc of Tokimeki Memorial OAV.

01:29:24.680 --> 01:29:25.680
Really?

01:29:25.680 --> 01:29:29.960
Yeah, and I bought it because it had a big Konami logo on it.

01:29:29.960 --> 01:29:31.520
Fun.

01:29:31.520 --> 01:29:34.480
That really pretty much does it for release dates.

01:29:34.480 --> 01:29:36.320
I'm looking at the Sony PSP.

01:29:36.320 --> 01:29:41.320
I guess I should say Hatsune Miku Project Diva is coming out this week.

01:29:41.320 --> 01:29:43.080
I think this has been covered on a previous show.

01:29:43.080 --> 01:29:44.080
It is a rhythm game.

01:29:44.080 --> 01:29:47.600
There's a number of people in the chatroom who have been all kinds of hyper about getting

01:29:47.600 --> 01:29:48.600
it too.

01:29:48.600 --> 01:29:49.600
Yeah, so...

01:29:49.600 --> 01:29:50.600
It's the Vocaloid.

01:29:50.600 --> 01:29:53.200
It's the Sega rhythm game, so I bet there's some people...

01:29:53.200 --> 01:29:54.200
But you...

01:29:54.200 --> 01:29:55.200
Oh, you know what it is?

01:29:55.200 --> 01:29:56.200
I'm sorry.

01:29:56.200 --> 01:29:57.200
It's a price reduction.

01:29:57.200 --> 01:29:58.200
It's not the initial release.

01:29:58.200 --> 01:30:00.720
But you know who Hatsune Miku is?

01:30:00.720 --> 01:30:01.720
The Vocaloid.

01:30:01.720 --> 01:30:07.320
You know, remember sending you all those videos of the electronic girl voice singing?

01:30:07.320 --> 01:30:08.320
Yeah, I do.

01:30:08.320 --> 01:30:09.320
That's her.

01:30:09.320 --> 01:30:13.840
Chaos Head Noah is the last game I'm going to mention this week, also on the PSP.

01:30:13.840 --> 01:30:17.400
That's an adventure game that's coming out there on the PSP in Japan.

01:30:17.400 --> 01:30:20.120
All right, DarkSakura, how about the Old Kingdom?

01:30:20.120 --> 01:30:24.240
Well, um, eh.

01:30:24.240 --> 01:30:25.240
That's my official answer.

01:30:25.240 --> 01:30:27.480
No, um, we've got a number of things.

01:30:27.480 --> 01:30:32.640
On the 23rd, we have Land Bandit and Puzzle Quest 2.

01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:34.960
Excuse me.

01:30:34.960 --> 01:30:43.040
And on the 25th, we have Armada 2526, Backbreaker, Demon's Souls, Lego Harry Potter Years 1-4,

01:30:43.040 --> 01:30:47.560
Naughty Bear, that just sounds like a bedroom nickname.

01:30:47.560 --> 01:30:50.320
Someone's been a naughty bear.

01:30:50.320 --> 01:30:57.320
Singularity, Transformers War for Cybertron, and that is it for this week.

01:30:57.320 --> 01:30:58.320
All right.

01:30:58.320 --> 01:31:03.080
That's going to do it for release dates for right now.

01:31:03.080 --> 01:31:04.080
What's that?

01:31:04.080 --> 01:31:05.080
Are you a naughty bear?

01:31:05.080 --> 01:31:06.080
I'm a very naughty bear.

01:31:06.080 --> 01:31:10.520
YYR in our chatroom, I love this, talking about Love Plus, although AlphaKananagram is

01:31:10.520 --> 01:31:11.520
saying it's Love Plus Plus.

01:31:11.520 --> 01:31:13.520
Hey, I just read it like it was written, okay?

01:31:13.520 --> 01:31:17.320
YYR says, uh, I'll be waiting for the depressing sequel, Love Minus.

01:31:17.320 --> 01:31:20.200
It takes place after all the girls dump the main character's sorry ass.

01:31:20.200 --> 01:31:22.760
There you go, that's the real game right there.

01:31:22.760 --> 01:31:27.040
Chat.orangeacollegenity.com if you want to join in the fun.

01:31:27.040 --> 01:31:28.600
It's such a weird game.

01:31:28.600 --> 01:31:29.600
Yeah.

01:31:29.600 --> 01:31:32.560
Uh, at least you don't poke witches in it.

01:31:32.560 --> 01:31:42.400
Um, so E3 of course was pretty big, and there was 45,600 attendees, and next year you can

01:31:42.400 --> 01:31:46.000
expect E3 to be coming out slightly earlier.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:50.360
June 7th through the 9th, it will be also at the LA Convention Center, and of course

01:31:50.360 --> 01:31:54.160
they're expecting probably an even bigger turnout for that as well.

01:31:54.160 --> 01:31:55.160
So.

01:31:55.160 --> 01:31:56.160
Alrighty.

01:31:56.160 --> 01:32:00.520
300 exhibitors this year as well.

01:32:00.520 --> 01:32:02.840
You know what though, the show's starting to get a little big.

01:32:02.840 --> 01:32:08.740
Like I, that was oddly worded the way I said, but I mean, I don't want it to get as big

01:32:08.740 --> 01:32:12.880
as it was in 2006, especially when Kensha Hall is now a parking lot, which is what they

01:32:12.880 --> 01:32:14.880
use Kensha Hall for now, by the way, just so you know.

01:32:14.880 --> 01:32:15.880
It's a parking lot?

01:32:15.880 --> 01:32:18.160
Yes, it's a parking lot, people park their cars in there.

01:32:18.160 --> 01:32:19.160
In the hall?

01:32:19.160 --> 01:32:20.160
In the hall.

01:32:20.160 --> 01:32:21.160
When did that get dirty?

01:32:21.160 --> 01:32:23.720
Uh, I think the floor is probably removable.

01:32:23.720 --> 01:32:26.920
They can do that now.

01:32:26.920 --> 01:32:29.960
I'm not kidding, when I went down there to use the bathroom at one point, I looked in

01:32:29.960 --> 01:32:31.400
the doors, there's all these cars parked in there.

01:32:31.400 --> 01:32:35.240
I don't know if it was the exhibitors or what, but that's what they use Kensha Hall for now.

01:32:35.240 --> 01:32:36.240
Weird.

01:32:36.240 --> 01:32:40.560
Well, you know what, this is a good story for us to kind of sort of end on here on this

01:32:40.560 --> 01:32:45.160
part A, and that is that, you know, the news doesn't stop just because E3 is over, and

01:32:45.160 --> 01:32:51.200
apparently Hideo Kojima is, and they were saying he was at E3 this week, showing off

01:32:51.200 --> 01:32:52.680
Metal Gear Solid Rising.

01:32:52.680 --> 01:32:53.680
But.

01:32:53.680 --> 01:32:54.920
He was at the press conference.

01:32:54.920 --> 01:32:55.920
Yeah.

01:32:55.920 --> 01:33:02.200
Apparently, he is sitting on a massive PS3 exclusive that was not ready to show at E3.

01:33:02.200 --> 01:33:04.920
They're going to show it at Tokyo Game Show.

01:33:04.920 --> 01:33:07.260
So don't forget, the news does not end at E3.

01:33:07.260 --> 01:33:11.040
There are still other expos that people are going to show their big news.

01:33:11.040 --> 01:33:16.120
This is coming from a CVG, computer and video game source, that apparently there is a PlayStation

01:33:16.120 --> 01:33:20.820
3 exclusive that is supposed to, quote, own the show in Tokyo.

01:33:20.820 --> 01:33:25.700
They really wanted to have it ready for E3, but it unfortunately just was not ready.

01:33:25.700 --> 01:33:29.280
And maybe they didn't want to steal the thunder from Metal Gear Solid Rising anyway.

01:33:29.280 --> 01:33:31.120
No idea what it could be.

01:33:31.120 --> 01:33:34.720
Could it be an existing Kojima series like Boktai?

01:33:34.720 --> 01:33:35.720
Probably not.

01:33:35.720 --> 01:33:36.720
Zone of the Enders?

01:33:36.720 --> 01:33:37.720
I somehow doubt that too.

01:33:37.720 --> 01:33:38.720
Yeah.

01:33:38.720 --> 01:33:41.480
I think this is probably going to be a whole new thing.

01:33:41.480 --> 01:33:43.720
Or maybe another just Metal Gear Solid game.

01:33:43.720 --> 01:33:44.720
Nah.

01:33:44.720 --> 01:33:45.720
Probably not that.

01:33:45.720 --> 01:33:46.720
I think it'll be an all new Kojima game.

01:33:46.720 --> 01:33:47.720
But we'll see.

01:33:47.720 --> 01:33:50.600
Metal Gear Solid move party.

01:33:50.600 --> 01:33:53.640
Snake party!

01:33:53.640 --> 01:33:54.640
Oh wait.

01:33:54.640 --> 01:33:55.640
That sounds bad.

01:33:55.640 --> 01:33:59.840
Alright, well we can't end part A here at Orange Lounge Radio without doing a segment

01:33:59.840 --> 01:34:02.240
we love here at Orange Lounge Radio.

01:34:02.240 --> 01:34:03.800
The classic game of the week.

01:34:03.800 --> 01:34:07.960
It's a chance for Dark Sakura to go in the gaming vault and say, hey!

01:34:07.960 --> 01:34:11.880
I know you people have been playing all these newfangled games and been re-nup on these

01:34:11.880 --> 01:34:17.240
3D systems, these Microsoft flails and all this stuff, but you know what?

01:34:17.240 --> 01:34:19.440
Don't forget your roots, kids.

01:34:19.440 --> 01:34:23.040
Here's a classic video game you bitches should be playing, right Dark Sakura?

01:34:23.040 --> 01:34:24.040
Yes.

01:34:24.040 --> 01:34:26.640
This is a game that I love.

01:34:26.640 --> 01:34:30.120
Alright, what is the classic video game of the week, Dark Sakura?

01:34:30.120 --> 01:34:38.560
This is a game that was for the PC Engine Super CD called Silphia.

01:34:38.560 --> 01:34:40.040
Silphia?

01:34:40.040 --> 01:34:46.960
Yeah, and I had to go to different sources to find more information about it because

01:34:46.960 --> 01:34:51.640
I haven't played the game for a little while myself, but it's a fun little shooter.

01:34:51.640 --> 01:34:55.920
It's a 2D shooter set in mythological Greece.

01:34:55.920 --> 01:35:02.440
You have a ton of extra lives and you get a special attack called the Giga Fairy Beam.

01:35:02.440 --> 01:35:03.440
Fairy Beam?

01:35:03.440 --> 01:35:06.240
Yes, because you play as a fairy.

01:35:06.240 --> 01:35:08.560
You're a fairy.

01:35:08.560 --> 01:35:14.520
It's not really one of the greatest games because it's really not super challenging,

01:35:14.520 --> 01:35:19.640
but it's just really, really nice.

01:35:19.640 --> 01:35:32.400
You start off with this woman warrior who dies protecting Athena's temple and so she

01:35:32.400 --> 01:35:48.360
turns into a Silphia so she can go and basically stop all the people who tried to hurt all

01:35:48.360 --> 01:35:50.640
of them, so it's sort of the main story.

01:35:50.640 --> 01:35:55.520
Anyway, you fly around and you get power-ups.

01:35:55.520 --> 01:36:04.440
Your power-ups are bee icons and you have different bosses you fight.

01:36:04.440 --> 01:36:11.840
One's a colossus and one is, I believe, that you fight a gorgon in one level too.

01:36:11.840 --> 01:36:19.600
Like that one, you're fighting this big demon thing that takes off his head, I think.

01:36:19.600 --> 01:36:25.360
It really goes for things from different Greek mythology.

01:36:25.360 --> 01:36:29.920
You have a flying chariot that's pulled by manticores.

01:36:29.920 --> 01:36:35.120
It's pretty fun, pretty flight of fancy sort of game.

01:36:35.120 --> 01:36:39.160
It is put out by Compile and Compile has brought out a lot of good games.

01:36:39.160 --> 01:36:41.680
There's your reason right there to play it, honestly.

01:36:41.680 --> 01:36:48.520
That's the people who did the Guardian Legend, need I say more.

01:36:48.520 --> 01:36:51.640
It's pricey to try to find a copy of it now.

01:36:51.640 --> 01:36:53.080
It really is.

01:36:53.080 --> 01:36:56.680
I have a copy.

01:36:56.680 --> 01:37:02.280
It goes for about $100 average on eBay, but it's a really good game, really fun.

01:37:02.280 --> 01:37:06.600
I would say, for those of you out there who've got Magic Engine, get a disc image of it and

01:37:06.600 --> 01:37:10.040
give it a go and then fork out $100, see if you like it.

01:37:10.040 --> 01:37:13.560
You know what this reminds me of a little bit is Legendary Wings, just in looking at

01:37:13.560 --> 01:37:16.440
it, kind of, but cute.

01:37:16.440 --> 01:37:19.600
This robo monster she's fighting right now has ginormous tits.

01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:20.600
Yeah.

01:37:20.600 --> 01:37:21.600
Look at that.

01:37:21.600 --> 01:37:22.600
Since I have a golem, I think.

01:37:22.600 --> 01:37:27.480
Give me a little bra, perverts, but too bad about that Medusa head.

01:37:27.480 --> 01:37:28.480
Yeah.

01:37:28.480 --> 01:37:30.640
All right, there it is.

01:37:30.640 --> 01:37:35.200
That's the one thing I also wanted to point out too, is that your attack can go directional

01:37:35.200 --> 01:37:37.560
based on proximity.

01:37:37.560 --> 01:37:38.560
Very cool.

01:37:38.560 --> 01:37:44.360
It is, it makes fighting the bosses a little bit more dynamic than your average 2D shooter.

01:37:44.360 --> 01:37:50.800
Your classic game of the week for the PC Engine, a compile classic, Sylvia is the classic game

01:37:50.800 --> 01:37:51.800
of the week.

01:37:51.800 --> 01:37:56.480
A game so crazy rare, Dark Sakura had to really scour the web to find more information on

01:37:56.480 --> 01:37:57.480
it.

01:37:57.480 --> 01:38:00.100
All right, that's going to do it for your classic video game of the week.

01:38:00.100 --> 01:38:02.280
We have plenty more to come here at Orange Lounge Radio.

01:38:02.280 --> 01:38:05.360
You know, there's a lot of news that still kind of happened that was little things that

01:38:05.360 --> 01:38:09.000
happened at E3, and we're going to talk all about that when we come back in Part B. Also,

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:12.560
I need to talk about the big battle, because I didn't mention that in Part A, because E3

01:38:12.560 --> 01:38:14.860
was going on, but I want to mention a little bit more about that.

01:38:14.860 --> 01:38:16.080
We got the mailbag.

01:38:16.080 --> 01:38:20.480
We got the Twitter topics, and all that other fun stuff coming right back at you when we

01:38:20.480 --> 01:38:30.080
come right back here on more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:38:30.080 --> 01:38:32.800
And welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:38:32.800 --> 01:38:39.400
We are live with our 371st episode on this June the 20th of 2010, where we are taping

01:38:39.400 --> 01:38:45.040
live, of course, as we do every Sunday night at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.

01:38:45.040 --> 01:38:49.640
Speaking of All Games, amongst all the E3 madness, I nearly neglected to mention this,

01:38:49.640 --> 01:38:53.040
and I definitely wanted to mention this at some point tonight, but this has been kind

01:38:53.040 --> 01:38:57.680
of building for a couple weeks here, and that is the Big Battle, which is a competition

01:38:57.680 --> 01:39:00.920
between several of the shows on the All Games Network.

01:39:00.920 --> 01:39:02.240
It is not the host.

01:39:02.240 --> 01:39:05.360
It's the listeners that actually are going to be doing some of the competing in these

01:39:05.360 --> 01:39:06.360
games.

01:39:06.360 --> 01:39:09.200
And there's still more games to be announced.

01:39:09.200 --> 01:39:14.440
Think of it as like a gaming Olympics, and you can get all the information at thebigbattle.net.

01:39:14.440 --> 01:39:16.920
I think also bigbattle.allgames.com works.

01:39:16.920 --> 01:39:19.520
It really doesn't matter which one you use, but definitely check out that site.

01:39:19.520 --> 01:39:23.720
I'm going to go ahead and copy paste that link into our chat room right now at chat

01:39:23.720 --> 01:39:28.480
room.orangeloungeradio.com, so you can sign up to represent OLR, because we're only the

01:39:28.480 --> 01:39:30.680
second largest team on there right now.

01:39:30.680 --> 01:39:34.680
And I don't think we can really rest until we're the largest team being represented in

01:39:34.680 --> 01:39:35.680
the Big Battle.

01:39:35.680 --> 01:39:38.160
But then we actually have to win some of the competitions, too.

01:39:38.160 --> 01:39:44.520
And really wrapping up soon, Battlefield Bad Company 2 and Soldner X2.

01:39:44.520 --> 01:39:46.440
Both of those battles wrapping up very soon.

01:39:46.440 --> 01:39:51.080
I believe there's going to be a live Battlefield competition on the 26th, and then Soldner

01:39:51.080 --> 01:39:55.440
X2 is basically get the highest score you can in the next week.

01:39:55.440 --> 01:39:59.040
But I will say some new competitions were added, because we got a lot of Twitter feedback

01:39:59.040 --> 01:40:02.920
when we first announced the Big Battle, like, well, where are the games that I own?

01:40:02.920 --> 01:40:03.920
I don't own those games.

01:40:03.920 --> 01:40:05.520
Well, remember, guys, it's like the Olympics.

01:40:05.520 --> 01:40:09.040
There's going to be more and more games that are added as this event goes on.

01:40:09.040 --> 01:40:13.480
And some of the new games that were added, Pinball, that's right, Zen Pinball and Pinball

01:40:13.480 --> 01:40:14.480
FX.

01:40:14.480 --> 01:40:18.680
So you can play the Earth Defense Force table for a high score in Zen Pinball, or you can

01:40:18.680 --> 01:40:22.120
play Pinball FX, the Buccier table on the 360.

01:40:22.120 --> 01:40:25.960
Both those events end on July 9th, and more information is available on thebigbattle.net.

01:40:25.960 --> 01:40:27.680
And it's just high score.

01:40:27.680 --> 01:40:31.420
And if we get the highest score, then our team gets, like, 10 points, and that's great.

01:40:31.420 --> 01:40:35.040
So everybody should sign up and just get the highest score you can.

01:40:35.040 --> 01:40:38.800
And we're going to show all these other all-game shows that were much more than just the music

01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:42.640
games and all that fun stuff, that we can bring it to the table on some of these other

01:40:42.640 --> 01:40:43.640
games too.

01:40:43.640 --> 01:40:44.640
So it'll be fun.

01:40:44.640 --> 01:40:45.640
So check that out again.

01:40:45.640 --> 01:40:51.440
One more time, thebigbattle.net, and we'll bring you the results for Soldner X2 and Battlefield

01:40:51.440 --> 01:40:53.760
Bad Company 2, hopefully for next week's show.

01:40:53.760 --> 01:40:58.800
Hopefully the folks behind the all-games radio Big Battle will be able to get those results

01:40:58.800 --> 01:41:01.800
to me soon.

01:41:01.800 --> 01:41:06.440
Moving on with show stuff, we're going to do some rapid-fire news here in Part B and

01:41:06.440 --> 01:41:07.800
then get to the Twitter topics.

01:41:07.800 --> 01:41:11.640
So if you still need to get your Twitter topics in, you have just a few more minutes.

01:41:11.640 --> 01:41:15.640
Alright, Loki, why don't you start us off with some of the stuff that may be a missed

01:41:15.640 --> 01:41:21.720
at E3 amongst all these 3DSs and Valve on PlayStation and all this other stuff that

01:41:21.720 --> 01:41:23.080
was going on.

01:41:23.080 --> 01:41:24.080
This is kind of neat.

01:41:24.080 --> 01:41:28.920
Secret of Mana is coming to the iPhone later this year.

01:41:28.920 --> 01:41:32.160
Basically going to be a port of the SNES game.

01:41:32.160 --> 01:41:37.380
And they didn't really say when exactly it's going to be ported over, but sometime in 2010.

01:41:37.380 --> 01:41:41.080
So keep on looking out for that one.

01:41:41.080 --> 01:41:44.400
Also, by the way, just because I noticed it's not mentioned here, Final Fantasy Tactics

01:41:44.400 --> 01:41:47.020
is also in that same boat.

01:41:47.020 --> 01:41:48.480
Very cool.

01:41:48.480 --> 01:41:52.480
Another game coming to the iPhone is Bit.Trip Beat.

01:41:52.480 --> 01:41:55.800
That's going to be coming out as well.

01:41:55.800 --> 01:42:00.760
No word on exactly when that is, but it is coming out soon.

01:42:00.760 --> 01:42:01.760
So that's kind of cool.

01:42:01.760 --> 01:42:10.440
They're going to use, I guess, the tilt controls to move the paddle in just like the Wii version.

01:42:10.440 --> 01:42:17.680
Scott Pilgrim vs. The World is getting kind of an arcade game.

01:42:17.680 --> 01:42:24.360
It's going to be exclusive on the PlayStation Network for a certain period of time.

01:42:24.360 --> 01:42:26.960
It will be coming out August 10th.

01:42:26.960 --> 01:42:34.960
And of course, this game looks absolutely amazing and really I don't understand why

01:42:34.960 --> 01:42:41.040
people before when I was posting that we should do, what was it, remember we had that list

01:42:41.040 --> 01:42:45.080
list or whatever for the versus games and I picked a really obscure reference to the

01:42:45.080 --> 01:42:51.840
guy that did the, you know, King of 9 billion percent or whatever.

01:42:51.840 --> 01:42:52.840
Yes.

01:42:52.840 --> 01:42:53.840
Yes.

01:42:53.840 --> 01:42:54.840
I do remember that.

01:42:54.840 --> 01:42:55.840
Yes.

01:42:55.840 --> 01:42:56.840
That was many weeks ago.

01:42:56.840 --> 01:42:57.840
That's the guy that animated this game.

01:42:57.840 --> 01:42:58.840
Oh wow.

01:42:58.840 --> 01:42:59.840
Okay.

01:42:59.840 --> 01:43:00.840
And it looks freaking awesome.

01:43:00.840 --> 01:43:03.280
I don't remember the guy's name, but I'm sure the chat room will figure that out.

01:43:03.280 --> 01:43:05.960
But it looks awesome.

01:43:05.960 --> 01:43:12.080
Like I actually think about, I may pick this up on the PlayStation Network maybe if I have

01:43:12.080 --> 01:43:16.880
the patience, I guess I could wait, but it looks so cool.

01:43:16.880 --> 01:43:20.040
Who did that?

01:43:20.040 --> 01:43:26.360
I'm trying to remember now.

01:43:26.360 --> 01:43:27.360
I don't remember.

01:43:27.360 --> 01:43:30.360
I'll look it up and chime in later.

01:43:30.360 --> 01:43:32.880
And then let's see here.

01:43:32.880 --> 01:43:39.080
Last thing, rock band stuff coming out this week because yes, unlike certain other music

01:43:39.080 --> 01:43:43.200
game platforms, they actually do have stuff that comes out every single week.

01:43:43.200 --> 01:43:45.760
Not always good though.

01:43:45.760 --> 01:43:51.360
This week we will be getting the Miley Cyrus pack number one, which means I guess there's

01:43:51.360 --> 01:43:53.600
going to be more than one later on.

01:43:53.600 --> 01:43:59.080
Included in that will be a few Miley Cyrus tracks, including 7 Things, Can't Be Tamed,

01:43:59.080 --> 01:44:04.080
Fly on the Wall, See You Again, and Start All Over.

01:44:04.080 --> 01:44:10.400
Those are each available for $2 or the equivalent in your fictional points, and the whole pack

01:44:10.400 --> 01:44:12.920
will be available for 680 Microsoft points.

01:44:12.920 --> 01:44:17.200
I have no idea what that translates to in real world money, but I can guarantee it's

01:44:17.200 --> 01:44:20.960
going to be slightly cheaper than buying them all separate if you're really going to buy

01:44:20.960 --> 01:44:24.640
them all separate, or if you were even going to buy them at all.

01:44:24.640 --> 01:44:30.040
Those will be available June 22nd.

01:44:30.040 --> 01:44:32.920
I thought the listeners would appreciate a little taste of Miley Cyrus there.

01:44:32.920 --> 01:44:35.760
She's more talented than her dad.

01:44:35.760 --> 01:44:39.800
She's always important to her grandmother.

01:44:39.800 --> 01:44:40.800
Really?

01:44:40.800 --> 01:44:41.800
Yeah.

01:44:41.800 --> 01:44:43.680
I have a funny story about this.

01:44:43.680 --> 01:44:44.680
Can I tell it real quick?

01:44:44.680 --> 01:44:45.680
Tell them.

01:44:45.680 --> 01:44:50.920
I was admiring the wall of songs that they had at the harmonics booth, and one of the

01:44:50.920 --> 01:44:54.240
gals that worked for harmonics kind of caught me looking at it and said, yeah, it's an impressive

01:44:54.240 --> 01:44:55.240
list, huh?

01:44:55.240 --> 01:44:57.400
And I said, you know, it could really use some more Lady Gaga.

01:44:57.400 --> 01:45:00.160
You know, I was just kind of joking, right?

01:45:00.160 --> 01:45:03.080
And she said, well, you better stay tuned for next week.

01:45:03.080 --> 01:45:04.360
She says, there won't be Lady Gaga.

01:45:04.360 --> 01:45:08.400
I can't tell you who it is yet, but there's definitely a lady coming to X, Y, she was

01:45:08.400 --> 01:45:09.400
talking about Miley Cyrus.

01:45:09.400 --> 01:45:13.080
I kind of want to go back and find her and say, that's not what I meant.

01:45:13.080 --> 01:45:14.680
Or you want to punch her in the face?

01:45:14.680 --> 01:45:16.160
No, she was nice.

01:45:16.160 --> 01:45:19.980
I don't want to punch her in the face, but I just want to, I just want to set her straight.

01:45:19.980 --> 01:45:26.760
The Miley Cyrus is not, not, not the same as Lady Gaga.

01:45:26.760 --> 01:45:28.760
Thank you.

01:45:28.760 --> 01:45:37.240
And, uh, the, the person that I was looking for that, uh, did the, um, Scott Pilgrim game,

01:45:37.240 --> 01:45:43.280
Paul Robertson, he's the guy doing the sprites and that guy can animate like nothing else.

01:45:43.280 --> 01:45:44.920
It is one sexy looking game.

01:45:44.920 --> 01:45:51.520
And if that's not cool enough, uh, apparently there's a chiptune rock band, uh, on a Monoguchi

01:45:51.520 --> 01:45:54.520
that's going to be, uh, providing the soundtrack for the game.

01:45:54.520 --> 01:45:57.240
So seriously, pick it up.

01:45:57.240 --> 01:46:02.880
If you have to wait for it to come out and, uh, Xbox live, then fine.

01:46:02.880 --> 01:46:05.720
By the way, can I read some of the, uh, chat room comments here?

01:46:05.720 --> 01:46:08.680
Uh, Toa Gak says, fucking shit, Sky, turn it off.

01:46:08.680 --> 01:46:13.920
The doctor 4945 says my achy breaky ears, uh, shadow runner says, Sky, you just blew

01:46:13.920 --> 01:46:15.960
out my eardrum with that god awful music.

01:46:15.960 --> 01:46:16.960
Thanks JK.

01:46:16.960 --> 01:46:17.960
Lulz.

01:46:17.960 --> 01:46:18.960
There you go.

01:46:18.960 --> 01:46:24.000
So our chat room, always appreciative of the antics here at orange lounge radio, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:29.680
If you want to, uh, yell at me for playing certain songs on the air, uh, going over to

01:46:29.680 --> 01:46:31.120
some other quick news.

01:46:31.120 --> 01:46:36.200
This might've been the game of the show, uh, for Loki had he gone, uh, hello Kitty seasons

01:46:36.200 --> 01:46:37.380
is coming to the Wii.

01:46:37.380 --> 01:46:38.380
That's right.

01:46:38.380 --> 01:46:39.380
Finally.

01:46:39.380 --> 01:46:40.380
Hello Kitty is getting a Wii game.

01:46:40.380 --> 01:46:43.400
I believe she had a game cube game, but now she's getting a Wii game.

01:46:43.400 --> 01:46:45.760
Hello Kitty seasons will be on the Wii this holiday.

01:46:45.760 --> 01:46:47.480
Um, I don't really know what it's about.

01:46:47.480 --> 01:46:51.280
I think it's a puzzle game, but does anyone really fucking care?

01:46:51.280 --> 01:46:54.360
I know Loki cares, but I'll send him the link so you can read it offline.

01:46:54.360 --> 01:46:57.360
I bought kitty the cool so you could play it.

01:46:57.360 --> 01:47:02.000
By the way, if you were thinking of picking one of these up, not hello kitty, but a, uh,

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:06.520
Microsoft racing wheel, you might want to get that now because, uh, mad cats is saying

01:47:06.520 --> 01:47:10.320
that, uh, Microsoft will no longer be having them produce this.

01:47:10.320 --> 01:47:15.440
Uh, they really had to kind of carefully say this, but they were saying, you're going to

01:47:15.440 --> 01:47:17.880
have to check with Microsoft for further information.

01:47:17.880 --> 01:47:22.640
Uh, but it's mad cat's understanding that Microsoft is exiting the wheel market.

01:47:22.640 --> 01:47:24.600
That was from mad cat's PR manager.

01:47:24.600 --> 01:47:29.480
And obviously I can see why with, uh, the tall connect, whatever you want to call it

01:47:29.480 --> 01:47:30.480
coming out soon.

01:47:30.480 --> 01:47:34.840
Uh, they want to just not have, I bought one of those, um, to use with my arcade cabinet

01:47:34.840 --> 01:47:40.280
actually cause I have one of those wireless adapters for the, uh, 360 controls.

01:47:40.280 --> 01:47:43.160
I love my 360 controller for PC games.

01:47:43.160 --> 01:47:48.280
Like I use it with crisis and I use it with grand theft auto on there, um, I haven't tried

01:47:48.280 --> 01:47:54.640
the racing wheel yet with actual, any actual games, but I can't wait to use it for like,

01:47:54.640 --> 01:47:59.860
you know, driving games on mame, uh, dark Tetsuya in our chat room says at least Miley

01:47:59.860 --> 01:48:00.860
likes hello kitty.

01:48:00.860 --> 01:48:03.520
Just going to that last story, tying things together.

01:48:03.520 --> 01:48:04.520
I like that.

01:48:04.520 --> 01:48:05.520
Oh yes.

01:48:05.520 --> 01:48:06.520
Um, more quick things.

01:48:06.520 --> 01:48:09.760
Oh, to medias, uh, is, uh, coming out for the X-Box three 60.

01:48:09.760 --> 01:48:15.600
I was not on the show floor, uh, but it was quickly announced it, um, Konami's press conference

01:48:15.600 --> 01:48:19.680
that auto medias is going to come out, uh, on the X-Box three 60 that's right here in

01:48:19.680 --> 01:48:20.680
North America.

01:48:20.680 --> 01:48:24.200
Um, and I believe, what is this hot booby action in this game a little bit, right?

01:48:24.200 --> 01:48:25.200
Right.

01:48:25.200 --> 01:48:26.200
He is with boobies.

01:48:26.200 --> 01:48:27.200
Yay.

01:48:27.200 --> 01:48:29.320
So if you like Gradius and if you like boobies, then this game will be for you.

01:48:29.320 --> 01:48:33.960
And it's a sequel to the Gradius booby game that was on, um, the Japanese three 60.

01:48:33.960 --> 01:48:34.960
That's right.

01:48:34.960 --> 01:48:35.960
Cause this is called auto medias.

01:48:35.960 --> 01:48:36.960
Excellent.

01:48:36.960 --> 01:48:37.960
So it's actually like kind of like a sequel.

01:48:37.960 --> 01:48:39.960
It's no auto medias gorgeous.

01:48:39.960 --> 01:48:40.960
No gorgeous was the original.

01:48:40.960 --> 01:48:41.960
Sorry.

01:48:41.960 --> 01:48:42.960
Excellence is.

01:48:42.960 --> 01:48:43.960
Oh, okay.

01:48:43.960 --> 01:48:44.960
Sequel, whatever.

01:48:44.960 --> 01:48:45.960
Boobs and Gradius.

01:48:45.960 --> 01:48:46.960
That's what they should just call the game.

01:48:46.960 --> 01:48:55.280
Boobs and Gradius gratuitous booby is, um, our friends, buddy pals at bamani style.com

01:48:55.280 --> 01:49:01.040
had actually a little interview with Naoki Medea at E3 asking about some of the hard

01:49:01.040 --> 01:49:03.840
questions about what the hell happened to DDR.

01:49:03.840 --> 01:49:08.440
Um, basically Naoki has said that his team is separated from the bamani team.

01:49:08.440 --> 01:49:12.560
Uh, he's saying that basically the U S has seen many more music games and his team wanted

01:49:12.560 --> 01:49:14.720
to focus on new experiences.

01:49:14.720 --> 01:49:19.400
Uh, basically in nutshell, they kind of danced around the, uh, question about what happened

01:49:19.400 --> 01:49:20.400
to the DDR games.

01:49:20.400 --> 01:49:22.000
They were not shown at E3.

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:25.480
The Wii one was, but the new ones on three 60 and PS3 weren't.

01:49:25.480 --> 01:49:29.440
And basically it was basically said, they're not really wanting to show them yet.

01:49:29.440 --> 01:49:34.360
Um, so, uh, some of the other things that had come up was, uh, they called out the direct

01:49:34.360 --> 01:49:36.680
comparison to the power of heart ice series.

01:49:36.680 --> 01:49:38.800
And now he said, yes, I did some work on that.

01:49:38.800 --> 01:49:41.720
Uh, but my team is no longer a part of the money.

01:49:41.720 --> 01:49:44.000
So dance masters is not able money game.

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.160
That's something important to point out.

01:49:46.160 --> 01:49:47.160
Hmm.

01:49:47.160 --> 01:49:51.640
Uh, they also said we have professional dancers and choreographers from all over the world,

01:49:51.640 --> 01:49:53.640
creating routines for dance masters.

01:49:53.640 --> 01:49:58.320
So I'm hoping with that in mind, that they are actually doing different styles of dance

01:49:58.320 --> 01:50:05.360
and it's not just the Para stuff that perhaps the Para stuff was able to be finished first

01:50:05.360 --> 01:50:09.760
because you know, maybe they either have the motion capture data for it, or they already

01:50:09.760 --> 01:50:12.320
have routines down for that kind of stuff.

01:50:12.320 --> 01:50:13.320
I'm hoping.

01:50:13.320 --> 01:50:17.840
I also thought this was interesting and I really hope Naoki, um, means this when he

01:50:17.840 --> 01:50:21.440
says this, uh, he was asked a question by Bimani style about, uh, given that you've

01:50:21.440 --> 01:50:24.260
worked on all these different types of games, do you think that peripheral based games have

01:50:24.260 --> 01:50:25.880
a strong future in America?

01:50:25.880 --> 01:50:30.220
And he says, okay, at Konami, we did Guitar Freak, StrawMania, 2DX, DDR, and these games

01:50:30.220 --> 01:50:33.600
made the app, created the atmosphere of playing an instrument or dancing.

01:50:33.600 --> 01:50:38.200
And then in America, rock band, DJ hero, guitar hero made it feel more real while still being

01:50:38.200 --> 01:50:39.360
a game.

01:50:39.360 --> 01:50:43.200
We are trying to create an even more real experience while still being the most fun

01:50:43.200 --> 01:50:44.200
possible.

01:50:44.200 --> 01:50:45.600
So we would like to be flexible.

01:50:45.600 --> 01:50:48.240
Here's the part I think you should pay special attention to.

01:50:48.240 --> 01:50:53.840
We would also like to collaborate in the future with famous producers and musicians to make

01:50:53.840 --> 01:51:01.200
music exclusively for our games, which I think is a good idea.

01:51:01.200 --> 01:51:02.520
I think that's a great idea.

01:51:02.520 --> 01:51:04.520
So we'll see if that actually pans out.

01:51:04.520 --> 01:51:10.700
Arguably, um, the game, you know, DDR, some of the best music in DDR was the music coming

01:51:10.700 --> 01:51:11.700
from Konami.

01:51:11.700 --> 01:51:13.640
So it makes sense.

01:51:13.640 --> 01:51:14.640
All right.

01:51:14.640 --> 01:51:19.100
How about some Twitter topics you guys, should we go to Twitter and see what the listeners

01:51:19.100 --> 01:51:21.320
are showing us on their tweets?

01:51:21.320 --> 01:51:25.560
By the way, if you want to show us your tweets, all you have to do is follow O L R on Twitter

01:51:25.560 --> 01:51:29.040
at twitter.com slash O L R and you can send us our tweets.

01:51:29.040 --> 01:51:32.720
We always say, Hey, you guys have a few minutes to get those topics in, uh, for what everyone

01:51:32.720 --> 01:51:33.720
to talk about.

01:51:33.720 --> 01:51:36.800
Keep in mind, I'm not going to read every tweet we get because sometimes you guys link

01:51:36.800 --> 01:51:38.980
to stories that are going to come up a little later in the show.

01:51:38.980 --> 01:51:40.800
So it's not because I don't like you.

01:51:40.800 --> 01:51:41.800
I promise.

01:51:41.800 --> 01:51:43.400
Uh, let's see.

01:51:43.400 --> 01:51:48.000
Um, I thought this was an interesting link here from tiger claw three Oh five on Twitter

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:51.300
is sending us this Sony downplays the three DS.

01:51:51.300 --> 01:51:55.160
Because you know, Sony, Sony was trying to show a lot of three D at their conference

01:51:55.160 --> 01:51:56.160
too.

01:51:56.160 --> 01:51:58.800
And then Nintendo just kind of came out and said, well, you don't need glasses for ours.

01:51:58.800 --> 01:51:59.800
Uh huh.

01:51:59.800 --> 01:52:00.800
So here it is.

01:52:00.800 --> 01:52:05.000
Uh, Sony, it kind of a downplay this a little bit cast her eyes specifically.

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:11.220
He said, quote, based off internally conducted research, naked eye, three D for portables

01:52:11.220 --> 01:52:13.720
does not have high precision.

01:52:13.720 --> 01:52:16.400
And at present there are limitations.

01:52:16.400 --> 01:52:22.400
He would not comment on the three DS itself, however, because he had not yet seen the system.

01:52:22.400 --> 01:52:25.360
Here's the problem, Mr. Her eye.

01:52:25.360 --> 01:52:28.240
They've got the games to back it up.

01:52:28.240 --> 01:52:32.260
Whereas I dunno, I guess I should say some of the games that sound like they're a pretty

01:52:32.260 --> 01:52:38.340
awesome on them, the Sony, uh, uh, three D experience sound pretty cool, but the move

01:52:38.340 --> 01:52:40.400
I'm a little less excited about.

01:52:40.400 --> 01:52:45.160
It's just that they, I mean, when they come up with him with questions like that, what's

01:52:45.160 --> 01:52:46.160
he going to say?

01:52:46.160 --> 01:52:47.160
Whoa.

01:52:47.160 --> 01:52:48.160
That's amazing.

01:52:48.160 --> 01:52:49.160
Wish we had thought of that.

01:52:49.160 --> 01:52:53.440
You know, I mean, he's obviously going to try to put something Microsoft and Nintendo

01:52:53.440 --> 01:52:58.640
up until connect was announced, was kind of trading these little like, you know, hearts

01:52:58.640 --> 01:53:00.040
for each other.

01:53:00.040 --> 01:53:04.800
You know, they used to kind of compliment each other until Microsoft decided they were

01:53:04.800 --> 01:53:07.920
not going to have any of this competition anymore and go right after it.

01:53:07.920 --> 01:53:10.320
It's been fun playing with you, but now you must die.

01:53:10.320 --> 01:53:11.320
Exactly.

01:53:11.320 --> 01:53:16.800
Dark Tetsuya links us to a story where apparently Reggie has said, you know, maybe young kids

01:53:16.800 --> 01:53:22.320
should probably not play the three DS, but he actually means very young children.

01:53:22.320 --> 01:53:25.460
We recommend that very young children not look at the three D images.

01:53:25.460 --> 01:53:29.520
That's because in young children, the muscles for the eyes are not fully formed.

01:53:29.520 --> 01:53:32.860
This is the same messaging that the industry is putting out with three D movies.

01:53:32.860 --> 01:53:34.240
So it is a standard protocol.

01:53:34.240 --> 01:53:38.160
We have the same type of messaging for the virtual boy as an example.

01:53:38.160 --> 01:53:43.440
I tend to make my baby cross-eyed seven years or older.

01:53:43.440 --> 01:53:46.920
According to Reggie fees and may, I would be very, again, I think the disclaimers on

01:53:46.920 --> 01:53:50.240
this thing are going to be a mile long.

01:53:50.240 --> 01:53:54.940
Alpha Kana gram is saying CH children of eat or chart child of Eden three DS.

01:53:54.940 --> 01:53:55.940
Good idea.

01:53:55.940 --> 01:53:56.940
Am I right?

01:53:56.940 --> 01:53:57.940
I mean, it would look cool on three DS.

01:53:57.940 --> 01:53:59.480
It's from alpha Kana gram.

01:53:59.480 --> 01:54:03.600
Uh, that might be too much going on.

01:54:03.600 --> 01:54:07.400
That might be too much for the eyes, but it would be, yeah, it'd be a little tough.

01:54:07.400 --> 01:54:11.760
I think something that's more wireframe like rez would lend itself a little easier to the

01:54:11.760 --> 01:54:15.040
three D stuff than maybe child of Eden.

01:54:15.040 --> 01:54:18.880
I would like to see a rez three D port, you know, something we didn't talk a lot about,

01:54:18.880 --> 01:54:22.920
but there's an, I apologize if I'm, I'm mentioning a story that's coming up, but there's hella

01:54:22.920 --> 01:54:26.040
hella ports being planned for the DS.

01:54:26.040 --> 01:54:29.760
Like, you know, if you think it was bad, all the stuff that's coming out now, man, they

01:54:29.760 --> 01:54:31.400
want to go back and do all these games.

01:54:31.400 --> 01:54:36.000
One of the games I played on the three DS was the old shooter, old shooter by Namco

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:37.800
Xevious.

01:54:37.800 --> 01:54:38.800
That's a great game.

01:54:38.800 --> 01:54:41.400
And it was three D. That's fantastic.

01:54:41.400 --> 01:54:44.120
And there's all these other old school three D games are going to go back and do.

01:54:44.120 --> 01:54:48.000
You probably heard about ocarina of time and I guess there's this list somewhere that details

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:53.120
all these games that into no one's to do in three D. So those are actually, they're not

01:54:53.120 --> 01:54:54.280
games that they want to do.

01:54:54.280 --> 01:54:55.720
They're in development already.

01:54:55.720 --> 01:54:56.720
Geez.

01:54:56.720 --> 01:55:01.120
Bob, what my brain just did something weird.

01:55:01.120 --> 01:55:05.480
It combined ocarina of time with weird Al doing the soundtrack.

01:55:05.480 --> 01:55:10.400
What the poker arena of time, that'd be the greatest thing ever.

01:55:10.400 --> 01:55:11.400
That was so strange.

01:55:11.400 --> 01:55:12.400
All right.

01:55:12.400 --> 01:55:13.400
I had to share that.

01:55:13.400 --> 01:55:14.920
It just popped into my head.

01:55:14.920 --> 01:55:15.920
Seriously.

01:55:15.920 --> 01:55:16.920
Weird Al game.

01:55:16.920 --> 01:55:18.320
Where is it?

01:55:18.320 --> 01:55:23.160
There has not been a weird Al game and Gallagher had a video game.

01:55:23.160 --> 01:55:28.040
That is just blasphemy that there has been no weird Al video game.

01:55:28.040 --> 01:55:33.200
And also I want to say I am also very disappointed with TV being the way it is nowadays.

01:55:33.200 --> 01:55:39.200
We should really seriously have our own UHF channel by now.

01:55:39.200 --> 01:55:42.720
Ray Iannami, oops sorry that was a retweet not a question.

01:55:42.720 --> 01:55:46.440
Richard Zard says I'm very upset I cannot meet up with you at E3.

01:55:46.440 --> 01:55:48.840
I tried to meet up with you at E3 but that didn't go so well.

01:55:48.840 --> 01:55:52.200
I was really looking forward to meeting you after three years of listening.

01:55:52.200 --> 01:55:56.700
Well unfortunately E3 is probably like the worst possible place to do a meetup because

01:55:56.700 --> 01:56:01.560
there's so much going on at E3.

01:56:01.560 --> 01:56:03.840
You know unfortunately it doesn't lend itself as well to meetups.

01:56:03.840 --> 01:56:07.800
It's like things like PAX and so forth and you know we were just there was just too much

01:56:07.800 --> 01:56:09.120
going on.

01:56:09.120 --> 01:56:13.520
But honestly I didn't know there was an interest beforehand for folks to kind of want to meet

01:56:13.520 --> 01:56:14.520
up.

01:56:14.520 --> 01:56:18.280
I didn't think enough of our listeners really went to the show but now that I know there

01:56:18.280 --> 01:56:22.440
are some I guess next year maybe we'll plan like a dinner one night or something we could

01:56:22.440 --> 01:56:23.440
probably do.

01:56:23.440 --> 01:56:28.080
But just on the show floor is just really like the worst possible place to have you

01:56:28.080 --> 01:56:31.880
know OLR reunions and so forth.

01:56:31.880 --> 01:56:37.360
SGA 100 Matt is asking us out of all the E3's you guys slash gal have gone to which is your

01:56:37.360 --> 01:56:44.680
fave worst and where does this one stack up to those?

01:56:44.680 --> 01:56:49.960
Easy my favorite was my first one because you never forget your first and that was also

01:56:49.960 --> 01:56:55.080
the year we met like a Kiryamoka and I had like the Silent Hill set up and it was a cool

01:56:55.080 --> 01:56:56.080
year.

01:56:56.080 --> 01:56:57.080
The room.

01:56:57.080 --> 01:57:02.320
And then later also Bamani or I'm sorry 2DX was announced for America right or maybe that

01:57:02.320 --> 01:57:03.320
was the next year.

01:57:03.320 --> 01:57:04.320
No that was.

01:57:04.320 --> 01:57:06.280
We had the distorted the second year I think.

01:57:06.280 --> 01:57:07.760
Oh maybe that's right.

01:57:07.760 --> 01:57:11.520
And the karaoke revolution country.

01:57:11.520 --> 01:57:17.760
My least favorite year was 2006 the year right before the break because that was year where

01:57:17.760 --> 01:57:22.440
Paris Hilton had a line going around there's just too damn many people at E3 and it kind

01:57:22.440 --> 01:57:24.740
of became a little bit of a joke.

01:57:24.740 --> 01:57:30.100
And then this year would be my second favorite E3 I felt that I just I got to do so much

01:57:30.100 --> 01:57:35.600
this year that I hadn't done in years past and I was keeping myself so busy with stuff

01:57:35.600 --> 01:57:38.640
that I was very pleased with the show this year and I think there was just a lot of good

01:57:38.640 --> 01:57:42.600
tech to see because I don't think last year's show was very good either that would probably

01:57:42.600 --> 01:57:45.800
be my second least favorite show next to the 06 show.

01:57:45.800 --> 01:57:52.440
So I would rank them 04, 10, 05, 09, 06.

01:57:52.440 --> 01:57:58.080
Well I can't really rank any of mine I mean there's good experiences and bad experiences

01:57:58.080 --> 01:58:01.720
and not all of them I link with the convention itself.

01:58:01.720 --> 01:58:12.480
So I would say I think that I really did like 2006 just because I got in a ton of awesome

01:58:12.480 --> 01:58:17.560
interviews that year and the year before that was pretty cool too because I piggybacked

01:58:17.560 --> 01:58:24.360
on my friend's press pass and the year before that was great because it was my first E3

01:58:24.360 --> 01:58:25.360
and I got in.

01:58:25.360 --> 01:58:30.760
I'd actually have to say though that my favorite experience of all the E3s was meeting Koji

01:58:30.760 --> 01:58:37.400
Kondo and getting it I found the little book with his autograph and that was just fantastic

01:58:37.400 --> 01:58:42.080
for me of course Dan his highlight is well the picture that's up there of him meeting

01:58:42.080 --> 01:58:50.640
Yu Suzuki I know that other than that though I did have a really massive migraine and having

01:58:50.640 --> 01:58:56.440
aching feet was kind of suck and Paris Hilton suck but you know what was actually cool was

01:58:56.440 --> 01:59:00.760
meeting the Harlem Globetrotters oh cool they were doing that charity thing so that was

01:59:00.760 --> 01:59:01.760
pretty cool.

01:59:01.760 --> 01:59:05.840
Takeo Ray sends us a message on Twitter have you seen the Penny Arcade comic about the

01:59:05.840 --> 01:59:10.720
E3 press conferences pretty accurate retelling oh god yes I did see that and it was great

01:59:10.720 --> 01:59:15.560
I laughed so hard somebody actually sent that to me on my phone while I was at E3 and I

01:59:15.560 --> 01:59:20.880
love the Reggie Fils-Aime in the middle panel new Zelda new Goldeneye new Kirby new Metroid

01:59:20.880 --> 01:59:25.560
new Kid Icarus new 3D shit no glasses Santa Claus is real he's in our booth and he's giving

01:59:25.560 --> 01:59:31.920
out fucking hand jogs Nintendo bitches we out is that great retelling of what actually

01:59:31.920 --> 01:59:36.920
happened that's gonna do it for Twitter topics tonight twitter.com slash olr thank you guys

01:59:36.920 --> 01:59:42.560
who submitted topics tonight how about some more news low-key what you got for us all

01:59:42.560 --> 01:59:47.360
right well let's see there's some stuff I kind of talked about a little bit earlier

01:59:47.360 --> 01:59:51.480
Ubisoft they had a lot of things that were announced during their press conference that

01:59:51.480 --> 01:59:56.360
kind of people scratching my head because they weren't really game video games perhaps

01:59:56.360 --> 02:00:04.160
I mean they're sort of games but not quite I don't know so for example mania planet was

02:00:04.160 --> 02:00:09.420
something that was announced in a partnership that between the company behind the track

02:00:09.420 --> 02:00:17.240
mania series and nadio and Ubisoft and one of the things that they of course showed off

02:00:17.240 --> 02:00:22.200
which is pretty awesome was track mania 2 gorgeous looking game they're going to be

02:00:22.200 --> 02:00:27.360
having a beta coming out for that you can test it out on this fourth quarter of this

02:00:27.360 --> 02:00:32.560
year shoot mania which is going to be the new kind of first-person shooter type of game

02:00:32.560 --> 02:00:37.400
that you'll be able to create custom levels for they're gonna have a beta for that sometime

02:00:37.400 --> 02:00:41.320
the first quarter of 2011 and finally quest mania which is going to be kind of like their

02:00:41.320 --> 02:00:46.040
RPG maker type of game that will be available for beta at some point they haven't really

02:00:46.040 --> 02:00:50.880
said when but it's kind of neat though because I know the track me I'm seriously underrated

02:00:50.880 --> 02:00:57.240
and she did better on consoles ended it really needs to come to like Xbox Live Arcade or

02:00:57.240 --> 02:01:05.520
even just like 360 or Playstation 3 it'd be really awesome one of the games I I kind of

02:01:05.520 --> 02:01:11.920
looked at him like you know had I seen this a few years ago or had it been actually cues

02:01:11.920 --> 02:01:17.960
are I may have to pick this up battle tag which is a game that is basically laser tag

02:01:17.960 --> 02:01:22.920
you've got a vest in these pistols that you run around with and these different targets

02:01:22.920 --> 02:01:28.320
that you can use for like checkpoints or whatever you can create your own kind of games out

02:01:28.320 --> 02:01:33.920
of it and it ties in with your PC which is kind of the scorekeeper kind of like the game

02:01:33.920 --> 02:01:38.960
master for the stuff and so they announced that it's kind of neat something you would

02:01:38.960 --> 02:01:43.960
probably see it like kencha hall if there was a kencha hall anymore but that's something

02:01:43.960 --> 02:01:49.800
else coming out later this year on PC not really like a game per se that you can't like

02:01:49.800 --> 02:01:54.360
just play like a first person shooter game with it on your PC it's actually just something

02:01:54.360 --> 02:01:59.080
that uses your PC for like scoring which is interesting and then the game that was pretty

02:01:59.080 --> 02:02:08.080
much you know the Wii Vitality sensor but not energy and apparently energy was a game

02:02:08.080 --> 02:02:12.540
that had a sensor that you would put on your finger or penis because you know it's going

02:02:12.540 --> 02:02:18.760
to happen and you would use this to kind of relax they had a breathing exercise that you

02:02:18.760 --> 02:02:26.640
could do they made Joel McHale do that because he was hosting the whole event and it's interesting

02:02:26.640 --> 02:02:33.720
I guess I don't know it's supposed to make you feel good which I guess putting your penis

02:02:33.720 --> 02:02:38.200
in the sensor might do that I don't know and that's why Santa Claus is at E3 I did post

02:02:38.200 --> 02:02:45.040
that I'm like oh good well energy what are they thinking time to penis is what exactly

02:02:45.040 --> 02:02:49.800
all right well moving on with some more news Silent Hill there was some news about that

02:02:49.800 --> 02:02:53.600
at E3 this year sadly it was not playable on the show floor but there was a new trailer

02:02:53.600 --> 02:02:57.800
that leaked to the internet and so perhaps you saw some information on that is gone to

02:02:57.800 --> 02:03:03.640
a new developer it's Vatra is now developing this game so it's going to be very different

02:03:03.640 --> 02:03:09.900
from me Silent Hill home shattered memories as well as Silent Hill homecoming also missing

02:03:09.900 --> 02:03:15.240
from this Silent Hill and this is huge Akira Yamaoka is not going to be a part of the new

02:03:15.240 --> 02:03:22.440
Silent Hill game so this means the new replacement will be Daniel Licht he does the theme song

02:03:22.440 --> 02:03:27.480
for Dexter the TV show and he also has done Hellraiser and Children of the Corn so I guess

02:03:27.480 --> 02:03:32.000
that's kind of cool sadly it's going to be not the same without Akira Yamaoka but at

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:36.200
the same time I'm looking forward to seeing what Silent Hill and new people's hands is

02:03:36.200 --> 02:03:40.440
going to be by the way the story if you haven't seen the trailer yet it's about a prison inmate

02:03:40.440 --> 02:03:44.440
and the transport vehicle basically you know overturns or something and now he's in the

02:03:44.440 --> 02:03:49.120
fog of Silent Hill which I noticed looked a lot like the movie so I guess you know they're

02:03:49.120 --> 02:03:53.880
incorporating the movie into the cannon or something I don't know so they are talking

02:03:53.880 --> 02:03:59.720
about evolving the combat in a different direction as opposed to doing one or the other from

02:03:59.720 --> 02:04:05.480
the previous games so I don't know Dark Sakura I know you're a big Silent Hill fan are you

02:04:05.480 --> 02:04:09.640
hopeful about the new Silent Hill game are you kind of like oh too much has changed this

02:04:09.640 --> 02:04:16.200
isn't going to be Silent Hill anymore I really have to see I'm going to reserve judgment

02:04:16.200 --> 02:04:19.640
that's a fair way to look at it definitely check out the trailer though if you haven't

02:04:19.640 --> 02:04:23.800
already it was pretty cool I gotta say all right what do you have for us Dark Sakura

02:04:23.800 --> 02:04:29.400
well um for those who have been interested in Fallout Online and I know that I've been

02:04:29.400 --> 02:04:32.440
kind of interested well you know first of all let me rewind just a little bit did you

02:04:32.440 --> 02:04:39.560
guys see the Fallout New Vegas trailer everything at Bethesda was appointment only um and I

02:04:39.560 --> 02:04:43.560
didn't see that trailer online no because I haven't even played Fallout 3 well I'm buying

02:04:43.560 --> 02:04:47.920
a little bit the trailer was online and it was great cool yeah um it was pretty funny

02:04:47.920 --> 02:04:55.320
actually Bobby was telling me it was very uh very neon in there yeah um well Fallout

02:04:55.320 --> 02:05:05.240
um online um is actually starting to uh solicit for uh betas for uh for their open beta so

02:05:05.240 --> 02:05:11.160
um if you go to the Fallout Online website um you should uh I actually I filled out the

02:05:11.160 --> 02:05:14.180
little form it's just like a little form you sign up for their mailing list and they'll

02:05:14.180 --> 02:05:21.320
send you information on the beta eventually um but the you know they did have uh Interplay

02:05:21.320 --> 02:05:27.920
had some legal issues for a while um but now it's finally seems like it's going forward

02:05:27.920 --> 02:05:38.000
so let's hope so I could deal with some post-apocalyptic you know killing of people too many MMOs so

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:42.560
many I'm still stuck on Star Trek Online nothing's gonna get me I know you are I know it doesn't

02:05:42.560 --> 02:05:48.040
mean I cannot flirt a little bit I'm not in a serious committed relationship nice I have

02:05:48.040 --> 02:05:54.160
an open relationship with Star Trek Online you can look but you just can't touch I can

02:05:54.160 --> 02:06:04.600
touch all I want to I trusted I'll always come back alright uh let's go to one more

02:06:04.600 --> 02:06:09.120
news story and then we got the mailbag coming at you a mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

uh one of the things that was shown off during the Konami press conference is of course Def

02:06:13.960 --> 02:06:19.240
Jam rap star uh what's kind of interesting though is they're gonna have this whole uh

02:06:19.240 --> 02:06:25.220
online aspect a lot of community features um different you know taunts and stuff like

02:06:25.220 --> 02:06:31.760
you can do you know uh rap battles or whatever and actually record different things and have

02:06:31.760 --> 02:06:38.320
like a community I guess there's gonna be uh Def Jam talent scouts and stuff like that

02:06:38.320 --> 02:06:46.760
oh wow keeping an eye on the uh good rap star players and whatnot uh that's it I don't know

02:06:46.760 --> 02:06:51.320
it's a lot of community stuff which is really cool uh you know what's interesting is that

02:06:51.320 --> 02:06:56.760
Def Jam rap star actually looks like a really solid game it's a bummer that I'm not as interested

02:06:56.760 --> 02:07:01.000
in the content there you know I can't rap please but it actually you know just kind

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:03.740
of looking at it and watching other people playing it and then hearing about all this

02:07:03.740 --> 02:07:08.560
community stuff I was kind of like why can't some of the other music games take a page

02:07:08.560 --> 02:07:15.080
from this Konami seriously you have this framework you know built for rap star just now make

02:07:15.080 --> 02:07:21.960
it into a singing game and call it karaoke revolution or you put this next to the glee

02:07:21.960 --> 02:07:26.320
game that they were also showing off and the glee game looks pathetic yeah the absolutely

02:07:26.320 --> 02:07:31.960
pathetic game is just a simple you know try to grab it you know the market for the glee

02:07:31.960 --> 02:07:38.320
stuff because those damn glee albums are top of the charts you know great we have people

02:07:38.320 --> 02:07:46.200
covering songs and it's popular now um I don't know it's it's interesting but if they actually

02:07:46.200 --> 02:07:50.800
put out a solid music game and support it with enough download content and had all the

02:07:50.800 --> 02:07:56.640
community stuff I think it would do really well I agree because yeah the Def Jam game

02:07:56.640 --> 02:08:01.880
actually it actually I gotta say this I actually kind of wanted to play it you know in the

02:08:01.880 --> 02:08:08.760
privacy of my own home when nobody's watching I kind of want Irene to play it she would

02:08:08.760 --> 02:08:14.440
be a lot of fun you know my birthday is coming up maybe I should ask the birthday fairy for

02:08:14.440 --> 02:08:19.640
some Irene playing Def Jam rap star she could get discovered by a Def Jam scout talent you

02:08:19.640 --> 02:08:25.800
know they had some rap stars actually there at E3 doing the rapping that's cool they had

02:08:25.800 --> 02:08:30.120
a Konami had a whole new booth layout this year it hasn't looked like it has in years

02:08:30.120 --> 02:08:35.480
past they were able to showcase several games it was kind of cool and you know just a kind

02:08:35.480 --> 02:08:38.680
of a neat game because I don't really care about wrestling games that much but the luchador

02:08:38.680 --> 02:08:44.440
game looks awesome lucha libre AAA good god did they have a whole show during that they

02:08:44.440 --> 02:08:49.120
didn't just have the the game at Konami's booth but then I guess the developers or somebody

02:08:49.120 --> 02:08:52.880
else had a whole huge area right behind it where they were doing the whole who's gonna

02:08:52.880 --> 02:08:56.440
be on the box for the game that's awesome and just all these wrestling matches going

02:08:56.440 --> 02:09:01.960
on all day I guess I was glad it kind of drew people in and kept them away from other stuff

02:09:01.960 --> 02:09:08.960
but I was just like dang it was a heck of people over there I didn't realize the wrestling

02:09:08.960 --> 02:09:20.840
was so popular anyhow let's go to the mailbag mailbag orange launch radio.com every week

02:09:20.840 --> 02:09:24.360
we dive in the mailbag and read emails for you guys I'm gonna take over this week since

02:09:24.360 --> 02:09:30.080
dark soccer is still a little bit you know rough over there with her voice so hopefully

02:09:30.080 --> 02:09:35.040
she'll be better soon although I should say there's not a lot to read I'm very disappointed

02:09:35.040 --> 02:09:40.960
in the listenership that during E3 week there's only two emails that you guys want us to read

02:09:40.960 --> 02:09:44.640
I'm hoping we get more this week after the wrap-up show please send us some emails mailbag

02:09:44.640 --> 02:09:48.240
orange launch radio.com I especially want to hear from people who have never emailed

02:09:48.240 --> 02:09:51.360
us before because sometimes we get these emails I've been listening for two years and I've

02:09:51.360 --> 02:09:55.800
never emailed you guys why not we want to hear from you guys what you guys think of

02:09:55.800 --> 02:10:02.240
E3 come on we won't we won't make fun of your spelling and grammar too much we promise all

02:10:02.240 --> 02:10:07.760
right first email from Robert M do you think the announcement of portal 2 and steamworks

02:10:07.760 --> 02:10:14.840
for the ps3 is related to the introduction of steam on the Mac yes and no I don't think

02:10:14.840 --> 02:10:20.520
they're necessarily directly related I think it's more of a you know hey yay valve and

02:10:20.520 --> 02:10:26.440
ps3 are playing nicely but I think definitely it it is a huge card in steam's pocket that

02:10:26.440 --> 02:10:30.440
it's multi-platform you know I'm gonna go off in a different direction though speaking

02:10:30.440 --> 02:10:34.680
of like gaming on the Mac and so forth one thing we haven't talked much about that on

02:10:34.680 --> 02:10:40.320
live was there at E3 and they had a pretty big presence and you know from the demos they

02:10:40.320 --> 02:10:44.320
were showing it looked pretty good like the games were playing pretty well over those

02:10:44.320 --> 02:10:50.340
little console boxes and apparently the system is out now on the PC and the Mac and apparently

02:10:50.340 --> 02:10:55.760
it I'm even seeing the feedback on Twitter and so forth it actually runs pretty well

02:10:55.760 --> 02:11:01.020
well I'll be damned I know I'll be damned huh who knew who knew but as far as steam

02:11:01.020 --> 02:11:05.800
goes you know I think certainly steam is trying to expand all these different places because

02:11:05.800 --> 02:11:09.860
it definitely looks good for them I don't know why I went on the tangent of on life

02:11:09.860 --> 02:11:15.080
but I guess just the whole like new stuff on the Mac Mac gamers what a niche audience

02:11:15.080 --> 02:11:18.400
no I'm just kidding Mac gamers have had a lot to celebrate this year I'll tell you that

02:11:18.400 --> 02:11:22.580
much that's for sure.

02:11:22.580 --> 02:11:27.840
Going to this other email from Brian S. who didn't have a fancy little nickname but we'll

02:11:27.840 --> 02:11:32.820
say Brian S. Hey OLR gang while reading the news on the PS move and the MS connect I started

02:11:32.820 --> 02:11:37.160
wondering these two items are really just expensive peripherals for a console but if

02:11:37.160 --> 02:11:42.300
any console peripherals really been successful sure during the NES era I loved power glove

02:11:42.300 --> 02:11:46.820
and play track and field on the power pad but just like R.O.B. they never have more

02:11:46.820 --> 02:11:52.160
than one or two games for them ignoring peripherals that are specifically made for a game I.E.

02:11:52.160 --> 02:11:57.980
music and dance genre games most peripherals like the super scope Sega CD 32 X PS 2 hard

02:11:57.980 --> 02:12:02.320
drive I toy and probably quite a few others I can't remember seem to lack support and

02:12:02.320 --> 02:12:06.820
third party game development initial launch titles do you think the same could happen

02:12:06.820 --> 02:12:14.660
to connect slash move if initial game sales are low no I say well I say yes as far as

02:12:14.660 --> 02:12:21.060
at least the move is concerned I think though it's tricky because you say well you can count

02:12:21.060 --> 02:12:25.100
these games but you can't count these well selling games I mean I realize that the music

02:12:25.100 --> 02:12:29.140
and dance things are a little more niche but if you look at connect as like really opening

02:12:29.140 --> 02:12:34.300
up the exercise exercise gaming thing then it's a little niche too well let's look at

02:12:34.300 --> 02:12:39.780
the Wii Fit balance board they use that in a lot of games I mean it's an add-on thing

02:12:39.780 --> 02:12:46.020
but I mean they use that we motion plus it's being used in a lot of things and I toy was

02:12:46.020 --> 02:12:49.780
used a lot more than I think you might be given it credit for especially in games for

02:12:49.780 --> 02:12:54.700
the younger audience I mean those aren't really specialized peripherals or anything but I

02:12:54.700 --> 02:12:57.740
mean if you think about a lot of stuff that they put out that specialized peripherals

02:12:57.740 --> 02:13:01.740
I mean it's specialized for a reason it's only gonna be used for a few things I mean

02:13:01.740 --> 02:13:07.620
I understand what you're talking about like the whole I toy and the PlayStation I camera

02:13:07.620 --> 02:13:12.780
or the Xbox 360 motion camera which was a big waste of money and I need to turn that

02:13:12.780 --> 02:13:19.060
in for some like store credit somewhere because I would have waste that turn out being exactly

02:13:19.060 --> 02:13:26.540
so yeah I mean I understand that and you know the expectations I guess for that were a little

02:13:26.540 --> 02:13:31.900
bit greater than they were now because I think with the PlayStation well even like with the

02:13:31.900 --> 02:13:35.860
motion camera on the Xbox 360 I think they were thinking it's going to be doing these

02:13:35.860 --> 02:13:40.420
kind of connect things but it it just it doesn't have the technology that really support that

02:13:40.420 --> 02:13:49.580
why why aren't our chats is saying yes absolutely yes to this question of will the same fate

02:13:49.580 --> 02:13:54.100
be met if initial game sales are low he's saying this is why Kinect should be $99 and

02:13:54.100 --> 02:13:58.580
not a penny more I agree that if they don't have a really awesome game pack in with this

02:13:58.580 --> 02:14:08.580
game or with connect the 150 is unfortunately past the sweet spot a lot of people are going

02:14:08.580 --> 02:14:13.980
to be in for as unpleasant shock to that if connect is $150 and it's sitting right next

02:14:13.980 --> 02:14:18.300
to a weed it's also $150 there's going to be people out there that don't realize you

02:14:18.300 --> 02:14:23.740
need an Xbox 360 to actually use Kinect and it's going to be depressing for some people

02:14:23.740 --> 02:14:29.860
bull they're probably trying to package you know their Xbox 360 Kinect combo or something

02:14:29.860 --> 02:14:33.660
like that that's why I'm saying you know you guys watch out because you're going to see

02:14:33.660 --> 02:14:39.600
the Kinect for $150 or whatever but you watch them drop the console price or something like

02:14:39.600 --> 02:14:47.100
ridiculous you know you may see they were saying that there isn't right now a $199 bundle

02:14:47.100 --> 02:14:54.380
but there will be a $199 skew for the Xbox 360 come on the holiday so they're putting

02:14:54.380 --> 02:15:00.340
out something I a little more here at the end of the email dark soccer and sky I hope

02:15:00.340 --> 02:15:04.220
you're both feeling better if not I hope you get well soon oh thank you I'm doing much

02:15:04.220 --> 02:15:07.940
better than it was the nightly show I am better it's just that my throat was really damaged

02:15:07.940 --> 02:15:12.780
and it hasn't fully healed yet and that's from Brian s again and also one more thing

02:15:12.780 --> 02:15:17.180
PS part of the reason I wrote this email was to have a reason to write I love to power

02:15:17.180 --> 02:15:22.700
glove it's so bad there you go that's your emails for this week mailbag at orange lounge

02:15:22.700 --> 02:15:26.940
radio.com please fill up our mailbag and so that way when dark soccer's voice is all better

02:15:26.940 --> 02:15:31.860
she has some work to do we like giving dark soccer lots of work to do don't we all right

02:15:31.860 --> 02:15:35.060
some more gaming news for you guys and then we're going to open up the skype line at one

02:15:35.060 --> 02:15:40.900
eight seven seven game OLR but don't call yet it ain't open yet Loki one last things

02:15:40.900 --> 02:15:45.860
that they showed off during the Ubisoft press conference and they didn't really show anything

02:15:45.860 --> 02:15:50.860
they just kind of hinted at that it's coming the Michael Jackson game the one that was

02:15:50.860 --> 02:15:57.500
rumored to be in development is now being developed by Ubisoft and no word exactly on

02:15:57.500 --> 02:16:02.060
what it is but it's something that's possibly going to be some singing dancing game that

02:16:02.060 --> 02:16:08.460
does support the connect and I think it's very sad that it's not Sega it is sad that

02:16:08.460 --> 02:16:15.940
should have been Sega but is Sega and Michael Jackson were BFFs it's moonwalker 2 but uh

02:16:15.940 --> 02:16:19.740
yet unclear exactly what it's supposed to be but they're saying that the game will be

02:16:19.740 --> 02:16:28.020
available for connect on Xbox 360 PlayStation move on the ps3 PSP Wii and DS anywhere they

02:16:28.020 --> 02:16:33.740
can milk that guy for you know more money in the afterlife they will in other words

02:16:33.740 --> 02:16:40.020
yeah I'm all right I'm right you're right hey this is pretty cool cuz I remember these

02:16:40.020 --> 02:16:44.940
games they were a lot of fun apparently Burger King is going to be coming back to the 360

02:16:44.940 --> 02:16:48.740
that's right the Burger King guy is coming back and this time it has to do with connect

02:16:48.740 --> 02:16:53.820
games buying all of them every single one I don't care how terrible they are I am buying

02:16:53.820 --> 02:16:59.020
all of them no news on the details no news on the style no news on the number of games

02:16:59.020 --> 02:17:04.740
all this being said so far is from Burger King chief marketing officer Mike Capit saying

02:17:04.740 --> 02:17:09.380
our first endeavor with Xbox 360 took the gaming world by storm so we couldn't pass

02:17:09.380 --> 02:17:13.660
up the chance to come together on another cutting edge program during this year's promotion

02:17:13.660 --> 02:17:17.900
our guests can look forward to an even greater adventure that will stimulate the imaginations

02:17:17.900 --> 02:17:22.220
of gamers and entertainment lovers of all shapes and sizes they were so like sneak king

02:17:22.220 --> 02:17:28.820
was so creepy you don't understand you cannot get more creepier than that game it is absolutely

02:17:28.820 --> 02:17:33.740
worth the money I don't care how terrible they are because terrible games can sometimes

02:17:33.740 --> 02:17:41.280
be good games like for example driver 3 terrible game let's not forget the games were five

02:17:41.280 --> 02:17:47.360
dollars four dollars three ninety nine my bad four dollars is an amazing deal hopefully

02:17:47.360 --> 02:17:54.860
they're just as expensive this year that'd be great that should be the pack-in right

02:17:54.860 --> 02:18:02.740
there you know there you go there's your reason to plunk 150 on connect there you go skeptics

02:18:02.740 --> 02:18:09.500
I think sneaking to featuring connect I think it's gonna be pretty awesome I I high hopes

02:18:09.500 --> 02:18:18.620
for the connect don't screw me again damn camera games I learned my lesson with I actually

02:18:18.620 --> 02:18:23.440
bought the camera for every single damn system they've all failed me so far except I did

02:18:23.440 --> 02:18:31.260
not buy the camera those on the week sound like exercise games but anyways so yeah there's

02:18:31.260 --> 02:18:35.200
some more features being announced for a little big planet to lots of cool stuff that they're

02:18:35.200 --> 02:18:41.940
showing the whole community features one aspect they're saying that of course getting revamped

02:18:41.940 --> 02:18:48.860
is all the stuff that they had it's gonna be easier to find players creations and of

02:18:48.860 --> 02:18:53.080
course the they're gonna have a different interface now no longer we have to search

02:18:53.080 --> 02:18:59.240
cross-planets to find different levels and the ability to actually bring them up a list

02:18:59.240 --> 02:19:06.920
also different like metrics like genres keywords etcetera and they're also saying that they're

02:19:06.920 --> 02:19:13.220
gonna be apparently there's gonna be some functions I guess by the little big planet

02:19:13.220 --> 02:19:19.120
dot me I guess the web portal where you're able to give players their own personal websites

02:19:19.120 --> 02:19:24.540
which automatically update with their creations and recently played levels and top scores

02:19:24.540 --> 02:19:30.720
so it's kind of like a Facebook for a little big planet type stuff and in it of course

02:19:30.720 --> 02:19:37.860
you can you know see the pages in the browser's games will be automatically queued up next

02:19:37.860 --> 02:19:43.820
time you play your game if you know pick different levels on there also you can just I guess

02:19:43.820 --> 02:19:48.940
print out one of the QR barcodes assigned to each level and you pop it in for your PlayStation

02:19:48.940 --> 02:19:54.240
I and your creations come up that kind of cool if you like made some games or whatever

02:19:54.240 --> 02:19:58.840
put it on your business card but that little barcode on there and then people can scan

02:19:58.840 --> 02:20:08.200
your barcode or your business card level pops up or or Rob think here for a second when

02:20:08.200 --> 02:20:13.160
it be awesome to get little big plan to you make business cards with like say our website

02:20:13.160 --> 02:20:17.780
on it with that barcode and you go when you load that level it has a bunch of information

02:20:17.780 --> 02:20:24.780
about our website the podcast all that stuff in level like a playable business card or

02:20:24.780 --> 02:20:28.220
those shirts we've been talking about doing for seven years you could put on the barcode

02:20:28.220 --> 02:20:34.000
on the shirt and then like or or maybe maybe we need all our pants so that way the barcode

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:40.500
is on the but and it could be here scan my butt and you could play a little big planet

02:20:40.500 --> 02:20:46.600
to the orange on radio experience using your but I think it's a great idea yeah we need

02:20:46.600 --> 02:20:50.860
all our pants are started do they do they do they let you make your own pants with logos

02:20:50.860 --> 02:20:58.020
on the but it would be hard there's got to be a way to do it I don't scream I mean who

02:20:58.020 --> 02:21:02.960
cares about shirts when you can have all our with a barcode but could do that you can do

02:21:02.960 --> 02:21:07.240
like I think on those like cafe press and stuff like that you can do like boxers and

02:21:07.240 --> 02:21:14.360
stuff well our underwear with the barcode on your body too hard to design a transfer

02:21:14.360 --> 02:21:20.700
it really wouldn't that's an even better idea I want to play the ULR level pull down your

02:21:20.700 --> 02:21:39.700
pants oh this is just wrong I'll show you my little big planet that's what you say on

02:21:39.700 --> 02:21:48.840
the back it would say little big planet and on the front it would just say big planet

02:21:48.840 --> 02:21:58.620
with two moons that orbit it all right I'm in the room with children tonight's show is

02:21:58.620 --> 02:22:03.460
like a little girl tonight's show has been way too serious e3 is serious business we

02:22:03.460 --> 02:22:08.940
needed some barcodes on your ass to to break the tension a little bit that's just you 100

02:22:08.940 --> 02:22:13.920
and that asks will that barcode make it easier to friend your but maybe that's what Nintendo

02:22:13.920 --> 02:22:21.220
print plans to have a repeat of the of the senior video maybe after the show I know maybe

02:22:21.220 --> 02:22:26.540

I was searching for stuff to do the stencils for the baby's room they do have things you

02:22:41.580 --> 02:22:48.820
can get where you can print your own temporary tattoos that could happen I know our temporary

02:22:48.820 --> 02:22:54.680
tattoo yes that's that's about what the giveaways were at e3 this year by the way I know people

02:22:54.680 --> 02:23:00.180
think you walk out of e3 with bags and bags of crap and them giving away 360 the one press

02:23:00.180 --> 02:23:03.860
cameras yeah it used to be that way but now in this economy like you're lucky if you get

02:23:03.860 --> 02:23:09.540
a temporary tattoo my boss brought me a Tron evolution t-shirt that has a the disc on the

02:23:09.540 --> 02:23:14.980
back and then also get that and also I got a paratig t-shirt I fucking play Tron I didn't

02:23:32.920 --> 02:23:39.220
figure set mm-hmm I got those for Dan somewhere in this house amongst all this crap Black

02:23:39.220 --> 02:23:43.860
Wolf saying he got the Tron shirt too what the hell is this here I am talking nice about

Tron and everything I ain't get no shirt oh well it's all right people need to send me

02:23:47.580 --> 02:23:55.500
a Tron shirt hmm I'm the biggest Tron fan in this room all right oh and Black Wolf is

02:23:55.500 --> 02:24:02.280
mad now he didn't get a rock band 3 shirt good we're even all right we are officially

02:24:02.280 --> 02:24:07.180
even all right one more story for you guys then we're gonna take some calls at 877 game

02:24:07.180 --> 02:24:11.540
olr or our username on skype is orange lounge radio and that is a new controller coming

02:24:11.540 --> 02:24:17.060
out for the PlayStation 3 that was being shown at e3 it was from a hori and they are marketing

02:24:17.060 --> 02:24:23.100
a ps3 MMO controller I'm assuming this is for Final Fantasy 14 and possibly DC Universe

02:24:23.100 --> 02:24:26.660
and it is a strange looking device I mean yes it's a keyboard but there's all these

02:24:26.660 --> 02:24:31.840
weird looking buttons on the side of it and most interestingly a device that you can pick

02:24:31.840 --> 02:24:37.500
up with like one hand so you can like play your MMO and control it with one hand and

02:24:37.500 --> 02:24:41.300
then type with the other or whatever else you want to do with well hey the way it looks

02:24:41.300 --> 02:24:44.500
like what it looks like no well what it look yeah I mean that's it's basically I don't

02:24:44.500 --> 02:24:48.160
think you can pick that up it's just meant to like rest your hand on it but basically

02:24:48.160 --> 02:24:52.580
they have it so that you know one analog stick it looks like and then a couple button I'm

02:24:52.580 --> 02:24:56.760
assuming those buttons are for the triggers are on one side and then the other side has

02:24:56.760 --> 02:25:01.460
the other analog stick and then it also has the four face buttons and I think the two

02:25:01.460 --> 02:25:05.340
trigger buttons as well you know it kind of reminds me of remember how they have that

02:25:05.340 --> 02:25:14.900
keyboard for Fantasy Star I think on the GameCube or something like that yes it's like that

02:25:14.900 --> 02:25:19.940
but honestly though just buy a USB keyboard you don't need this fancy piece of shit Toa

02:25:19.940 --> 02:25:23.860
Gak wants to know the time to penis for this controller because it does you know it does

02:25:23.860 --> 02:25:28.560
have a little curvature there where the looks like you would grab that little controller

02:25:28.560 --> 02:25:34.380
thing I'd expect to be longer than say the other relaxed type thing just because it's

02:25:34.380 --> 02:25:38.780
not obvious to put your penis in there and it'll probably come out in Japan first and

02:25:38.780 --> 02:25:43.860
they're not as disgusting as we are here in America so I would say it's gonna be at least

02:25:43.860 --> 02:25:52.380
a few days I think they're not I guess that's true I get let me say it's not as is all over

02:25:52.380 --> 02:26:02.220
the internet with vending machines about the vending machines and and moe lap pillows you

02:26:02.220 --> 02:26:06.660
think this is the country that's ooga-booga that's the country you know what though that

02:26:06.660 --> 02:26:11.100
brought us the Hello Kitty vibrator hold on hold on because they're not so repressed by

02:26:11.100 --> 02:26:15.500
having all of that there's no need to put your penis on an MMO controller that's because

02:26:15.500 --> 02:26:19.060
you have all these other but here in America where everybody's sheltered everybody gets

02:26:19.060 --> 02:26:33.900
freaky deaky behind closed doors the pecan all right what yeah whatever see see Bobby

02:26:33.900 --> 02:26:38.580
agree I think I'm on to something though with the fact that we don't notice it as much because

02:26:38.580 --> 02:26:43.220
they're not as repressed as we are over here oh shoot yeah the same the same country that

02:26:43.220 --> 02:26:50.100
gave us love blue girl I guess that's true too but still they're not tentacle porn Rob

02:26:50.100 --> 02:26:53.380
tentacle you're not hearing about them putting their dicks in things it's just that they

02:26:53.380 --> 02:26:59.880
marry inanimate objects how long is Japan anyway actually I was I was listening to a podcast

02:26:59.880 --> 02:27:05.000
just recently called stuff mom never told you oh it's by the people that did stuff you

02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:11.940
missed in history class yeah those are the podcasts I listen to hello but they were talking

02:27:11.940 --> 02:27:17.380
about how there actually is an epidemic sort of going around now in Japan where men are

02:27:17.380 --> 02:27:24.820
sort of withdrawing from dating and it's not that you know it's just that they're not interested

02:27:24.820 --> 02:27:30.220
in sex at all that's why they have the guy married his lap pillow and the guy married

02:27:30.220 --> 02:27:36.660
his video game and all of this and they're actually looking at it affecting birth rates

02:27:36.660 --> 02:27:41.400
in the future tiger Connor Tarrant says don't be surprised when people start taking photos

02:27:41.400 --> 02:27:47.220
of their 3d penis on the 3ds I thought that exactly and actually I hope there's ways you

02:27:47.220 --> 02:27:52.460
can share pictures online somehow that that is one really cool which is the worst possible

02:27:52.460 --> 02:27:56.280
comment to follow what tiger class said but I was thinking about it for other purposes

02:27:56.280 --> 02:28:00.380
thank you that is one cool thing though that they did have on the 3ds I think would be

02:28:00.380 --> 02:28:05.620
kind of neat to play around with I'm also wondering though with everything being based

02:28:05.620 --> 02:28:10.460
off like you know camera technology how long before we see a YouTube video or something

02:28:10.460 --> 02:28:19.220
like that some chick or whatever playing scantily clad you know god whatever just dance just

02:28:19.220 --> 02:28:26.940
lap dance up skirt cam 3d or you know dance central pole dance central yeah black woven

02:28:26.940 --> 02:28:33.120
chat says sky is thinking about craigslist 3d penis postings wave of the future folks

02:28:33.120 --> 02:28:37.240
wave of the future I don't want to see that wave of the future I had to I had to share

02:28:37.240 --> 02:28:43.580
the image with our chat room of of the poster for love so what you're suggesting is that

02:28:43.580 --> 02:28:51.140
it's chat roulette 3d oh god I don't what do you think is worse on the internet craigslist

02:28:51.140 --> 02:28:58.340
or chat roulette chat roulette even though you got robbed of a several hundred dollar

02:28:58.340 --> 02:29:03.700
machine on craigslist you still think chat roulette is worse probably I've never been

02:29:03.700 --> 02:29:13.940
on chat roulette so I can only imagine though nice we should we should do olr on chat roulette

02:29:13.940 --> 02:29:21.540
one night just for fun hi you're on orange lounge radio what what's that you guys are

I should go to chat roulette right now no I'm not gonna go chat roulette right now not

02:29:46.260 --> 02:29:50.620
gonna derail the show completely with chat roulette although I would like to see like

02:29:50.620 --> 02:29:54.820
maybe a podcast with some of the video game people just playing on chat roulette it'd

02:29:54.820 --> 02:30:00.900
be fun although the joke would probably get old real quick 1877 game olr or our username

02:30:00.900 --> 02:30:03.900
on skype is orange lounge radio give us a call if you want to ask us anything about

02:30:03.900 --> 02:30:07.860
e3 or talk about anything at e3 or maybe there was something on the show floor you didn't

02:30:07.860 --> 02:30:14.360
get to see enough of I don't know give us a call and we'll have some words in the meantime

02:30:14.360 --> 02:30:20.060
Loki you got any last minute stories for us yes let's talk about the summer of arcade

02:30:20.060 --> 02:30:24.140
coming out of course this summer they've announced the lineup for summer of arcade including

02:30:24.140 --> 02:30:29.060
castlevania harmony of despair hydro thunder hurricane lorecroft and the guardian of light

02:30:29.060 --> 02:30:33.900
limbo and monday night combat each if you buy all of those you will get a refund for

02:30:33.900 --> 02:30:43.120
800 microsoft points or ten dollars so ten dollars ten dollars yes let's go to the phones

02:30:43.120 --> 02:30:49.240
hi you're on orange launch radio who's this uh legend azaku well hey legend azaku what's

02:30:49.240 --> 02:30:59.100
on your mind uh just here on my bed with my mac um let's see um all that post e3 stuff

02:30:59.100 --> 02:31:05.380
that you're still trying to digest i suppose and you too that event for me was basically

02:31:05.380 --> 02:31:10.860
seeing the gran turismo 5 trailer ah that was completely missed by us here at olr that's

02:31:10.860 --> 02:31:16.580
right finally a freaking date for uh gran turismo 5 just play dancing games i'm a big

02:31:16.580 --> 02:31:22.340
i'm a big sucker for those like racing racing simulator games if you're a fan of racing

02:31:22.340 --> 02:31:28.660
games let me tell you this on the 3ds there was a demo on the floor for ridge racer it

02:31:28.660 --> 02:31:36.020
looked great but it played like garbage so i really hope this was just like a concept

02:31:36.020 --> 02:31:40.660
demo and that uh the real thing is fixed because when you run into a wall it's like not even

02:31:40.660 --> 02:31:45.980
realistic your car will turn like 45 degrees when you run into a wall it's crazy uh was

02:31:45.980 --> 02:31:51.740
it the psp ridge racer games i can't imagine it'd be too hard to port that stuff over but

02:31:51.740 --> 02:31:55.860
uh mario kart uh that concept video looked great but i know that's not like realistic

02:31:55.860 --> 02:32:00.900
racing but i just thought i'd throw that in there i mean when i actually saw the trailer

02:32:00.900 --> 02:32:06.380
i couldn't i couldn't imagine how detailed how much effort was put into actually making

02:32:06.380 --> 02:32:12.500
it look almost realistic hence the reason for the number of delays so at least at least

02:32:12.500 --> 02:32:18.660
in this at least in this video game generation duke nukem forever kind of got lost whereas

02:32:18.660 --> 02:32:25.900
um well in other words gt5 managed to beat duke nukem forever and like vaporware that

02:32:25.900 --> 02:32:30.420
never actually became vaporware but it's gonna happen it's gonna happen hey duke nukem at

02:32:30.420 --> 02:32:33.580
least has the manhattan game for whatever it's worth let me ask you this zach goes and

02:32:33.580 --> 02:32:36.820
share a racing game fan need to kind of bring up what happened at the press conferences

02:32:36.820 --> 02:32:42.980
what did you think of microsoft showing off forza with no wheel is that interesting to

02:32:42.980 --> 02:32:48.100
you or are you just kind of like gimmick gimmick this is like i need a wheel i need a physical

02:32:48.100 --> 02:32:55.500
wheel to grab onto something tangible not not some micky mouse pretend wheel if i want

02:32:55.500 --> 02:33:00.140
to do that i could just do that right now by just moving my my hands at ten and two

02:33:00.140 --> 02:33:04.800
in the air oh you're probably pissed about mad cats having to discontinue that wheel

02:33:04.800 --> 02:33:12.780
huh no i want my i want like a logic technique or something and mad cats is taking over production

02:33:12.780 --> 02:33:18.900
of that wheel they're not just microsoft is continuing mad cats i thought i took it away

02:33:18.900 --> 02:33:22.820
from the story that it just wasn't happening period no because i thought that they they

02:33:22.820 --> 02:33:26.020
even had a picture of the mad cats one that looked exactly like the other one unless i

02:33:26.020 --> 02:33:30.100
was photoshopped which it could have been um i was gonna say what'd be kind of cool

02:33:30.100 --> 02:33:36.060
is with these you know new camera peripherals and whatever that have something that incorporates

02:33:36.060 --> 02:33:40.460
where you actually play the game say with like a controller and then you can make a

02:33:40.460 --> 02:33:46.900
gesture or something like that to do something shift up and down break but then you need

02:33:46.900 --> 02:33:53.540
enough space to actually get you need no surface area to actually get the actual the you know

02:33:53.540 --> 02:33:58.700
the person to actually get their image in there and for the camera to do its logic to

02:33:58.700 --> 02:34:03.020
detect moves or not even necessarily anything that has to do with shifting but like you

02:34:03.020 --> 02:34:07.260
know perspective change or something like that so you can like do a little bit i mean

02:34:07.260 --> 02:34:11.740
head tracking they already said and sony already said that it's going to be supported for grants

02:34:11.740 --> 02:34:18.620
original five via the camera it's just that i you know i guess head tracking would make

02:34:18.620 --> 02:34:25.260
would you know make sense if you actually had like a vr headset not just through like

02:34:25.260 --> 02:34:30.780
a tv like i it wouldn't it wouldn't feel right if i'm just tilting my head one way i couldn't

02:34:30.780 --> 02:34:37.500
even see that that angle if it was trying to do that sort of head tracking unless i

02:34:37.500 --> 02:34:42.740
actually saw it in front of me all right well zaku i want to change the topic one more time

02:34:42.740 --> 02:34:46.680
here before we let you go because i i know you you've been a long time listener of the

02:34:46.680 --> 02:34:50.920
show and you you know you know a lot about music games surely you have an opinion on

02:34:50.920 --> 02:34:58.540
dance masters yeah um you mean that new konami game for the connect right yes yeah i actually

02:34:58.540 --> 02:35:04.060
read the interview on bamani style with nayoki and he's basically trying to you know he's

02:35:04.060 --> 02:35:10.820
trying to pitch that game trying to like because you know i mean it's gonna be it's gonna be

02:35:10.820 --> 02:35:16.540
a tough battle between what harmonix is is dishing out because i think if anything konami's

02:35:16.540 --> 02:35:21.860
pretty much missed the boat on some of these major events in the past 10 years of where

02:35:21.860 --> 02:35:27.140
they could have capitalized on on this whole you know on the whole rhythm gaming genre

02:35:27.140 --> 02:35:33.900
in this country and their failure to do it resulted in the prominence and rise of folks

02:35:33.900 --> 02:35:40.220
like that you know like like activision like harmonix and they missed the boat on so many

02:35:40.220 --> 02:35:45.020
occasions not i can't i don't really think i could take them seriously but that's not

02:35:45.020 --> 02:35:51.540
to say that i'm gonna like shun this game completely i know i know with the connect

02:35:51.540 --> 02:35:58.860
you know the new motion the new motion control scheme it kind of replaces the pads from from

02:35:58.860 --> 02:36:03.660
that perspective you won't you don't have to worry about buying a dedicated like peripheral

02:36:03.660 --> 02:36:09.900
just for that game if the camera could actually see the camera could actually see your whole

02:36:09.900 --> 02:36:16.340
body and detect and accurately detect all the movements then that could definitely go

02:36:16.340 --> 02:36:23.260
far not only just on the 360 or the consoles but think about a possible arcade application

02:36:23.260 --> 02:36:27.700
yeah be interesting it came in the arcade i gotta say too zacku having played it it

02:36:27.700 --> 02:36:33.100
it it reads really well i mean it's a scary accurate little thing however keep in mind

02:36:33.100 --> 02:36:37.020
we were at e3 where everything's in a very nicely controlled environment so i'm really

02:36:37.020 --> 02:36:40.540
curious to see if that continues right i mean yeah that's that's the thing with connect

02:36:40.540 --> 02:36:46.460
it hasn't been like i don't think it's been extensively um field tested that to the point

02:36:46.460 --> 02:36:52.720
where right it's still it hasn't been released yet but it's like a really it's close to like

02:36:52.720 --> 02:36:57.160
release candidate status anyways it's like late beta yeah if microsoft really really

02:36:57.160 --> 02:37:00.760
wanted to impress me those rooms the little bubbles that they were showing connect in

02:37:00.760 --> 02:37:04.820
on the show floor instead of being bright light rooms would it look like actual people's

02:37:04.820 --> 02:37:09.700
living rooms but maybe they weren't last year when i thought you know what i i mean last

02:37:09.700 --> 02:37:15.220
year when i actually saw when i actually heard of project natal i didn't realize that i actually

02:37:15.220 --> 02:37:19.080
didn't take them that seriously just because they were doing something that nintendo's

02:37:19.080 --> 02:37:25.620
already done and sony to an extent with the with the ps with the i-20 back in the playstation

02:37:25.620 --> 02:37:33.740
date and and then one year later we see how far how advanced this camera is and it's pretty

02:37:33.740 --> 02:37:39.420
much it's pretty much something in its own that could stand on its own because it's that

02:37:39.420 --> 02:37:45.160
it's not just any maybe you know it's not just any old mickey mouse camera that tries

02:37:45.160 --> 02:37:53.740
to detect you know a 2d image of that of that actor it actually goes it actually has another

02:37:53.740 --> 02:37:59.460
dimension to it so if it has if it's that accurate in turn you know with that type of

02:37:59.460 --> 02:38:05.560
detection that could really go that could really push microsoft foreign in this whole

02:38:05.560 --> 02:38:09.580
new genre that they're trying to dish out all right well uh zack we gotta let you go

02:38:09.580 --> 02:38:13.620

02:38:36.220 --> 02:38:40.260
they have for the playstation movie they did announce like their full list of games that

02:38:40.260 --> 02:38:45.180
are um well i guess coming soon first party they've got beach sketchers which i have no

02:38:45.180 --> 02:38:50.300
idea what the hell that is so com 4 ipet kung fu rider which is that one that you ride

02:38:50.300 --> 02:38:55.240
down the office chairs but now they added kung fu to it i guess uh sports champions

02:38:55.240 --> 02:39:03.500
uh start the party ecrochrome 2 tumble hustle kings um the fight lights out the shoot tv

02:39:03.500 --> 02:39:08.140
superstars high velocity bowling because they always need bowling uh pain which is that

02:39:08.140 --> 02:39:14.040
demo for pain uh heavy rain's gonna be getting support later on uh sing star dance little

02:39:14.040 --> 02:39:19.460
big planet 2 the sly collection uh heroes on the move which looks terrible uh killzone

02:39:19.460 --> 02:39:25.500
3 and sorcery which looks really terrible you didn't like the sorcery demo that looks

02:39:25.500 --> 02:39:31.700
stupid all right let's go to the phones hi you're on orange lounge radio who's this hey

02:39:31.700 --> 02:39:39.060
it's sturlock hey sturlock what's on your mind uh not much i was uh just wanted to give

02:39:39.060 --> 02:39:46.780
my thoughts and impressions about uh e3 yeah please do what you think um i was pretty impressed

02:39:46.780 --> 02:39:54.420
um i'm actually you probably wouldn't uh expect me to say this but uh i'm actually looking

02:39:54.420 --> 02:40:00.500
forward to the 3ds now of course for for listeners that may not know why that's a surprise because

02:40:00.500 --> 02:40:05.540
they're new to orange lounge radio why would that be a surprise to people uh because i'm

02:40:05.540 --> 02:40:11.620
uh totally blind so you know the three the 3d aspect of it is kind of meaningless to

02:40:11.620 --> 02:40:21.060
me but uh the reason i'm looking forward to it is because uh apparently um there's gonna

02:40:21.060 --> 02:40:30.000
be a much higher you know uh capacity um for like you know data storage so i'm looking

02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:36.340
forward to uh how the audio is gonna improve especially and with the really impressive

02:40:36.340 --> 02:40:42.860
lineup of games i'm uh i'm really looking forward to it absolutely i mean certainly

02:40:42.860 --> 02:40:50.100
the games are part of what wins me over as well you know as as neato and starfox 64 ocarina

02:40:50.100 --> 02:40:56.780
time uh paper mario i don't know super street fighter 4 i'm really looking forward to that

02:40:56.780 --> 02:41:00.860
you know it's how they do that no it's really sad that they did not have a demo for or even

02:41:00.860 --> 02:41:08.500
in development a new f-zero game with 3d yeah i know and i'm surprised with everything else

02:41:08.500 --> 02:41:16.700
that was announced maybe i immediately you know thought of you when that was announced

02:41:16.700 --> 02:41:25.400
funny enough i think a lot of listeners did so and uh also um i don't know if you guys

02:41:25.400 --> 02:41:33.300
got to see it but um the new mortal kombat looks just freaking insane you know sadly

02:41:33.300 --> 02:41:38.200
there was a huge line just to get in and see it although apparently it was playable in

02:41:38.200 --> 02:41:41.660
that little room that they were showing um and unfortunately we didn't get in there it

02:41:41.660 --> 02:41:46.380
was just a matter of prioritizing as much of a fan as mortal kombat as i am there was

02:41:46.380 --> 02:41:51.780
this other stuff i wanted to see more um it was getting a lot of very positive buzz though

02:41:51.780 --> 02:41:55.380
from the people that saw it it sounds like the franchise is going back in the right direction

02:41:55.380 --> 02:42:04.300
which thank you which thank god it's what it needed um and yeah i think i think that

02:42:04.300 --> 02:42:09.100
trailer is all you really need of dc universe i was not too impressed with the last few

02:42:09.100 --> 02:42:19.660
games um especially with that stupid story mode slash rpg element that was in a lot of

02:42:19.660 --> 02:42:25.360
them yeah i didn't care then they tried to do the puzzle combat and it just it just spread

02:42:25.360 --> 02:42:30.740
itself combat i think and uh was it motor combat they were trying to be like mario kart

02:42:30.740 --> 02:42:35.140
oh yeah remember when a mortal kombat game just randomly had the mario kart mode in it

02:42:35.140 --> 02:42:39.220
like what the hell was that was more for like just being funny i mean that was the whole

02:42:39.220 --> 02:42:48.500
point it's like huh like we're funny you know um yeah i still sucked well sturlock was there

02:42:48.500 --> 02:42:56.100
anything else out of e3 that really made you excited besides just the 3ds um not really

02:42:56.100 --> 02:43:04.260
i thought the move looked kind of stupid it seemed like okay the it's kind of like what

02:43:04.260 --> 02:43:09.060
you guys thought it's basically the weeb but with better graphics i think when you put

02:43:09.060 --> 02:43:15.080
these new things side by side the move and the um ds or 3ds the reason why you know loki

02:43:15.080 --> 02:43:18.940
just read off the big list of games that are coming to the move and i'm kind of just going

02:43:18.940 --> 02:43:24.100
eh either i already played it with a controller or i can play it with a controller or i'm

02:43:24.100 --> 02:43:27.900
just not really interested in dropping the money just to play it with a move that's oh

02:43:27.900 --> 02:43:33.580
i am kind of i am kind of looking forward to connect though with um seeing how the like

02:43:33.580 --> 02:43:39.620
the voice commands work i'm really curious because you know voice recognition kind of

02:43:39.620 --> 02:43:47.220
has this reputation of being a little iffy so i'm really curious how that's gonna like

02:43:47.220 --> 02:43:51.340
handle me too because that's not something they were really showing off at e3 again i

02:43:51.340 --> 02:43:54.300
think they might have been a little nervous about that technology they mentioned it a

02:43:54.300 --> 02:44:01.420
little bit um and i guess what you do is you just say you know xbox play or whatever but

02:44:01.420 --> 02:44:05.020
yeah they didn't show it off very extensively i think that their technology's gotten a lot

02:44:05.020 --> 02:44:09.740
better and obviously you know with sync and everything they have that technology kind

02:44:09.740 --> 02:44:14.660
of down i mean they have something developed in place for it so they're not going to release

02:44:14.660 --> 02:44:21.420
it you know without it working correctly yeah right hopefully well sterlock we gotta let

02:44:21.420 --> 02:44:24.860
you go to take more calls but thanks so much for your phone call and we'll talk to you

02:44:24.860 --> 02:44:31.100
again soon in a future week okay all right all right later see uh quick question from

02:44:31.100 --> 02:44:36.300
message 100 matt why is it that when nintendo ports gamecube to the wii wii poo poo it but

02:44:36.300 --> 02:44:43.020
when the 3ds ports a lot of n64 games we praise them that's a good question i i don't i actually

02:44:43.020 --> 02:44:47.860
think all the porting makes me nervous i don't really praise it in fact i think okra in time

02:44:47.860 --> 02:44:53.940
once again overrated damn game um i could care less that it's on there starfox 64 was

02:44:53.940 --> 02:44:59.460
kind of fun but yeah i don't want to see a bunch of old 64 games just being ported over

02:44:59.460 --> 02:45:03.940
because they can it's neat to see these things in 3d for the first time i'll give you that

02:45:03.940 --> 02:45:07.660
but is it 30 neat or however much they're going to charge for the games you know they're

02:45:07.660 --> 02:45:12.100
going to be more expensive than a regular ds game this is going to be an excuse to jack

02:45:12.100 --> 02:45:18.300
up the price 510 bucks you know that right you know that hi you're on orange lounge radio

02:45:18.300 --> 02:45:28.980
who's this who's dt hey dt what's on your mind buddy uh you know watching the e3 coverage

02:45:28.980 --> 02:45:37.340
all week mm-hmm how was e3 from the comfort of your living room oh still pretty good you

02:45:37.340 --> 02:45:41.660
know what sometimes i think that's that's the way to do it because a lot of those people

02:45:41.660 --> 02:45:46.320
can get into places that i sure couldn't out there on the show floor so uh there's anything

02:45:46.320 --> 02:45:51.200
wrong with uh staying tuned to the tv at home what caught your uh eyes and ears at e3 this

02:45:51.200 --> 02:46:01.460
year oh everything nintendo had pretty surprising yeah the 3ds was definitely something to behold

02:46:01.460 --> 02:46:05.260
not just that though i mean i know we keep talking 3ds 3ds but they really did have an

02:46:05.260 --> 02:46:10.660
impressive we line up i have not plugged in my we in about six months and now i'm like

02:46:10.660 --> 02:46:15.740
oh god metroid other m and goldeneye and the kirby game looks pretty good i'm gonna have

02:46:15.740 --> 02:46:24.220
to dust off that thing and uh get it in there oh yeah so all those first party games coming

02:46:24.220 --> 02:46:30.660
mm-hmm yeah lots and lots of stuff what'd you think of a connect and move well i thought

02:46:30.660 --> 02:46:37.060
that was cool i'd you know we pretty much called it as far as the uh dance masters goes

02:46:37.060 --> 02:46:41.460
isn't that that's the first thing we said was they should have like a paratype game

02:46:41.460 --> 02:46:46.820
for connect i'm not sure if i said it but i think someone here did and uh yeah they

02:46:46.820 --> 02:46:50.900
got it right you guys uh hit the nail on the head where as i said yeah right you're never

02:46:50.900 --> 02:46:55.540
gonna get a paratype game in the us and and here it is this is but but i think we can

02:46:55.540 --> 02:47:02.540
all agree this is as close as you're ever gonna get if dance masters is not enough for

02:47:02.540 --> 02:47:06.980
you have a night of fire in it with the actual para dance from back in the day i don't think

02:47:06.980 --> 02:47:12.300
there's really gonna be anything that's gonna make you happy at all you know what's really

02:47:12.300 --> 02:47:17.260
funny is that was actually one of my future uh my career view articles was gonna be about

02:47:17.260 --> 02:47:21.980
all those motion controlled dancing games like para para and dance maniacs and all of

02:47:21.980 --> 02:47:26.980
that well you're you're gonna have to get those up sooner rather than later now because

02:47:26.980 --> 02:47:30.900
everyone's gonna have to uh be curious about that by the way speaking of dance maniacs

02:47:30.900 --> 02:47:35.400
uh at arcade infinity they still had a working dance maniacs machine can you believe it after

02:47:35.400 --> 02:47:42.260
all these years i was just watching some videos of it randomly you know what their most popular

02:47:42.260 --> 02:47:48.740
video game was though at arcade infinity they had super street fighter four rigged up to

02:47:48.740 --> 02:47:53.680
a little one of those japanese sit down and play cabinets and it just said one token donation

02:47:53.680 --> 02:47:58.020
please and so you can actually play using the japanese cabinet and the controller and

02:47:58.020 --> 02:48:01.420
everything but since it was just running off a console they couldn't really charge people

02:48:01.420 --> 02:48:05.620
for it but they asked people to please make a token donation it had the longest line of

02:48:05.620 --> 02:48:12.700
anything there i saw crazy oh wow people want to have that arcade experience that oh yeah

02:48:12.700 --> 02:48:17.340
xbox it's not that hard to set up yeah it's very interesting that that was uh the most

02:48:17.340 --> 02:48:21.300
popular thing though probably the only other thing that really had a line was uh maybe

02:48:21.300 --> 02:48:28.020
either 2dx serious or uh dj max technica i was like hold notes what are these hold notes

02:48:28.020 --> 02:48:33.700
in my 2dx you know i have that's maniacs huh i have a dance maniacs do you read the actual

02:48:33.700 --> 02:48:38.860
machine i have the arcade board what i have a working arcade i have a system 573 board

02:48:38.860 --> 02:48:48.220
it's sitting at my desk it's a footrest right now look it up dummy let's play yeah all right

02:48:48.220 --> 02:48:53.900

too all right that's our own dark tetsuya who writes articles for orange lounge radio

02:49:13.220 --> 02:49:18.300
don't rig that up it wouldn't be that difficult to do i think you got a new project now i

02:49:18.300 --> 02:49:21.620
don't need more projects i have to finish the ones i have right now all right sorry

02:49:21.620 --> 02:49:24.900
to those who didn't get through tonight it was a very very busy phone ringing off the

02:49:24.900 --> 02:49:29.660
hook if you didn't get through though um i do always recommend uh our mailbag which is

02:49:29.660 --> 02:49:34.000
mailbag at orange lounge radio dot com or of course our twitter and all those other

02:49:34.000 --> 02:49:38.900
ways we interact with the show live chat and all that fun stuff too um any other quick

02:49:38.900 --> 02:49:43.100
last minute stories you want to get out loki yeah apparently you can use the playstation

02:49:43.100 --> 02:49:48.260
3 dual shock controller instead of the moves navigation controller this is a navigation

02:49:48.260 --> 02:49:54.020
controller costs thirty dollars by itself seriously thirty dollars eighty dollars per

02:49:54.020 --> 02:50:01.460
controller if you add the two together um this is interesting bobby kotak evil guy that

02:50:01.460 --> 02:50:06.420
works for activision of course you know he says whose idea it probably was to not have

02:50:06.420 --> 02:50:14.040
a booth and instead have that party he says um that he wishes that call of duty uh was

02:50:14.040 --> 02:50:18.980
a subscription service he says i would have call of duty be an online subscription um

02:50:18.980 --> 02:50:24.340
service tomorrow when you think about uh the audience's interests and how you could really

02:50:24.340 --> 02:50:28.860
satisfy a bigger audience with more inspired creative opportunities i would love to see

02:50:28.860 --> 02:50:35.220
uh or love to see us have an online call of duty world think our players would just um

02:50:35.220 --> 02:50:39.260
have so much of a more compelling experience in other words he thinks that people that

02:50:39.260 --> 02:50:44.820
buy call of duty are suckers and that they're willing to pay um extra money to play online

02:50:44.820 --> 02:50:49.560
with call of duty and to be honest with those 15 dollar map packs that sell like crazy he

02:50:49.560 --> 02:50:58.740
might be right which is really sad uh of course everyone wants to compare you know console

02:50:58.740 --> 02:51:06.940
versus console well now amazon has um different interests um of course that um show on their

02:51:06.940 --> 02:51:16.340
website for preorders whatever for connect and for the move and right now um apparently

02:51:16.340 --> 02:51:22.140
they have uh the connect holds the number one spot on their top selling uh video games

02:51:22.140 --> 02:51:28.820
list with the xbox 360 the new one right behind it and the first mention of the playstation

02:51:28.820 --> 02:51:33.660
move is the navigation controller which is at number 44 in the move starter bundle at

02:51:33.660 --> 02:51:40.880
number 46 so apparently right now there is more interest in the xbox connect let me read

02:51:40.880 --> 02:51:43.540
some comments from our chat room chat dot orange on twitter dot com by the way that's

02:51:43.540 --> 02:51:46.900
very interesting though how they're using amazon as a predictor that's kind of a neat

02:51:46.900 --> 02:51:50.740
way to do it tiger claw says uh oh you guys didn't mention that new mario sports game

02:51:50.740 --> 02:51:54.780
called mario sports mix who's down from some mario dodgeball i think it came up earlier

02:51:54.780 --> 02:51:58.860
in the show i mentioned it i thought it was stupid and i played it and it really yeah

02:51:58.860 --> 02:52:04.340
i played the volleyball game because the the dodgeball wasn't demoable it was cute but

02:52:04.340 --> 02:52:07.940
i think it's more of a kid it's basically mario simple it was too simple yeah it's basically

02:52:07.940 --> 02:52:12.220
mario tennis but they just have a bunch of different sports reskinned and stuff the basketball's

02:52:12.220 --> 02:52:15.100
kind of neat because it's a little bit like that mario three and three basketball game

02:52:15.100 --> 02:52:19.900
they have on the ds but speaking of basketball here's the game i didn't mention nba jam on

02:52:19.900 --> 02:52:25.020
the wii was out there on the show floor looked pretty awesome i gotta say i i'm very i'm

02:52:25.020 --> 02:52:29.820
interested in it i yes i'm interested in a sports game omg uh yyr in our chat room speaking

02:52:29.820 --> 02:52:34.500
on the bobby kotak story you just said says uh bobby kotak to increase our profit margins

02:52:34.500 --> 02:52:38.780
further i would love to personally fuck all of our customers in the ass of course they

02:52:38.780 --> 02:52:43.100
would have to pay me for it first i'm not sure how that increases profit margins might

02:52:43.100 --> 02:52:47.980
increase something there's some pictures that came out um showing the baby uh babysitting

02:52:47.980 --> 02:52:57.820
mama controller which looks like mama's head on a baby i guess it's kind of creepy i want

02:52:57.820 --> 02:53:02.900
to say my babysitting my babysitting mama that could be a song i got distracted i think

02:53:02.900 --> 02:53:06.900
it would have been funnier if the uh baby mama had looked like cooking mama but was

02:53:06.900 --> 02:53:14.540
black i got distracted what by our own wiki why i found the kmart page our wiki is pretty

02:53:14.540 --> 02:53:18.120

useless information about our show we need much more of that too did they ever put up

02:53:38.140 --> 02:53:45.220

work ahead of me thank you guys so much for downloading our show and tuning into orange

02:55:10.500 --> 02:55:13.960
lounge radio all we ask and all we've asked for the past eight years if you enjoy our

02:55:13.960 --> 02:55:17.620
show just tell people about the show help us spread the word of the show through word

02:55:17.620 --> 02:55:23.380
of mouth you know retweet and post links on facebook and help uh help us get more fans

02:55:23.380 --> 02:55:26.080
that's all we ask because we don't have a lot of marketing dollars or anything like

02:55:26.080 --> 02:55:31.260
that to pour into this show it would be nice if we had a million dollars but we don't and

02:55:31.260 --> 02:55:34.540
if you do get a million dollars apparently if you are a million dollar operation not

02:55:34.540 --> 02:55:39.300
only do you get invited to the conference but they'll just throw 360s at you who knew

02:55:39.300 --> 02:55:43.460
