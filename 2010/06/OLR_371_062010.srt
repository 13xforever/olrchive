00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,760
Tonight, June 20th, 2010, we talk about Nintendo going 3D, Microsoft going Kinect, Sony joining

2
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:31,840
forces with Steam, and more on our E3 wrap-up show, live.

3
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,720
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome to another week of that video

4
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:41,160
game talk show where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:45,240
Joining you over the next three hours, my name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always,

6
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:49,120
say hello to the one, the only, Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

7
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,120
Hi.

8
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,760
Hi, how are you, Jamie?

9
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,760
I'm doing better.

10
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,280
You're doing a little better in the voice department, it sounds like, but...

11
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,800
Yeah, but yesterday the wind kicked up and allergies got crazy so my voice was like...

12
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,120
At least you don't sound as terrible as I did on some of those nightly shows from E3

13
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,120
this week.

14
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,800
The Rob Roberts and Pals and Laryngitis is what it really should have been called, it

15
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:10,800
was pretty bad.

16
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,800
Pals with Laryngitis.

17
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:16,000
Oh, the smart ass over there is Loki, Tech Master Loki, how are you?

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,440
I'm fine.

19
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,520
And did you have a good week?

20
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,520
Not sure.

21
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,520
Yeah?

22
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:27,520
All right, so obviously the big pink elephant in the room, E3 was this past week and there's

23
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,720
lots and lots of news that we're gonna cover.

24
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:33,640
We realize a lot of you guys probably watch the press conferences and so forth so we don't

25
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:37,320
wanna reinvent the wheel here, although we do have some casual people listening to the

26
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,320
show.

27
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,620
We wanna make sure the big stuff is touched on for them.

28
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:44,680
But also, I do wanna point out, we wanna talk about the stuff that you wanna hear about

29
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,840
live.

30
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,680
So make sure you join us in our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com if you are listening

31
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,400
live on this Sunday night, cuz we do tape live every Sunday night at All Games Radio,

32
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:59,500
www.allgames.com at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.

33
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:03,480
So we're gonna be taking your questions about E3 and what you think maybe wasn't covered

34
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,400
well enough or maybe has been covered too much.

35
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:09,820
We're gonna take your Twitter questions, your emails, and all that fun stuff, as we always

36
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,720
do here on that show where every gamer has a voice.

37
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:15,820
We're gonna start off though, I mean, why change a good formula?

38
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,080
Just because it was E3 week.

39
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:20,680
We need to talk about the games we've been playing, and what kind of games you played

40
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,680
this week.

41
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,440
So, Dark Soccer, why don't you start us off.

42
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,440
How was your game week?

43
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:27,240
And by the way, actually, I should say this before you get started.

44
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:31,480
Dark Soccer and Loki were unable to go to E3 this year due to personal stuff.

45
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,480
Yeah, rub it in.

46
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,480
Well, I'm sorry.

47
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,480
I don't mean to rub it in.

48
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,520
But just, you know, in case the listeners are like, well, they're just gonna talk about

49
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,520
E3 all week.

50
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,520
No, no.

51
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,960
I mean, there was other games to be played besides just the ones at the LA Convention

52
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,120
Center.

53
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:50,260
I played Star Trek Online, which I was playing when you guys got here.

54
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:53,360
And I wanted to thank Bobby for going ten minutes over because it gave me time to finish

55
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,720
my mission.

56
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,160
So thank you, Bobby.

57
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,800
I was busy shooting Romulans.

58
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,800
Good times.

59
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,720
What else did I play?

60
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,720
That's really it.

61
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,280
You've just been addicted to Star Trek Online all week?

62
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,280
That's cool.

63
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,280
Yeah, that's what I played.

64
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,760
I really didn't play a whole lot because I started school.

65
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,760
Oh, again?

66
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,760
I thought you just finished.

67
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,760
I'm going in the summer.

68
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,760
Oh, boy.

69
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,080
All right, summer school.

70
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,200
Remember when summer school was just for the kids that flunked during the regular semester?

71
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,440
Now everybody does summer school.

72
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,280
Well, I do have to mention that I told you this earlier.

73
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,880
My teacher – I'm taking U.S. history – my teacher brought up the Oregon Trail.

74
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,880
Nice.

75
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:35,840
And she said, you remember that game, you know, where you have to stockpile meat and

76
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,840
everything?

77
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,840
We're like, Oregon Trail.

78
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,840
She's like, yeah, that game.

79
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,320
It's like, well, people really did die from all this stuff.

80
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:45,920
And I told her about your shirt, the one that said, you have died of dysentery.

81
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,280
And she laughed and then looked a little bit sick.

82
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,760
My teacher's also a little preggers.

83
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,820
Oh, I see.

84
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,600
So she carried a couple of pounds back to the wagon?

85
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,600
Yes.

86
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,600
Ah, I see.

87
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,160
You know that game where you're on a trail to Oregon?

88
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,160
What's it called again?

89
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,160
I don't know.

90
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,160
All right.

91
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,280
Loki, how was your gaming week?

92
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,640
I just played Grand Theft Auto.

93
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,640
That's pretty much it.

94
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,640
That's it?

95
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,360
That's all I had time for.

96
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,600
I don't think I played anything else.

97
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,640
Oh, a little bit of Earth Defense Force.

98
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,720
Just getting through that some more.

99
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:20,420
But mainly just Grand Theft Auto because I had to go lose a game by $2 one day.

100
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:24,480
So it means I had to take it out on my coworkers by kicking the crap out of them.

101
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:28,440
It was funny, though, because one of the games actually quadrupled second place's score.

102
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:32,200
I had $4,000 and the person below me had $1,000.

103
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,400
I kicked the crap out of them.

104
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,600
That was in 15 minutes, too, by the way.

105
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,880
Apparently my boss was bragging to Take Two because they had a meeting with them about

106
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,520
how wonderful I am at Grand Theft Auto, to which I'm sure they didn't care.

107
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:49,520
Yeah, I was going to say, I don't think Take Two would really be concerned with how good

108
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,520
you are.

109
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,640
He's like, did you know that there's somebody that works with us that's in the top 100 in

110
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,640
the world?

111
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,640
No, really?

112
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:59,800
Which I was like, okay, whatever.

113
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,560
You were glued to the E3 press conferences all week, though, right?

114
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,800
Yeah, I watched those instead of working because I can do that.

115
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,800
So were we.

116
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,160
We were watching from our hotel room because we don't get invited to fun stuff like that,

117
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,560
but that's okay.

118
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:18,920
So we got to watch them all from the comfort of our historic hotel room in downtown LA,

119
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,960
not far from where all the rioting was taking place after game seven, but I digress.

120
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:27,040
What did you think of all the press conferences as you were watching them, Loki?

121
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,040
They were pretty cool.

122
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:34,960
What was kind of unique, I guess, is no one really kind of failed at press conferences.

123
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,960
There wasn't any...

124
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:43,360
Nintendo, thank God, did not show anything about the Vitality sensor, which makes me

125
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,040
believe that they're not putting it out anymore.

126
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:51,320
I think they kept what's-her-name Kami tied up in a burlap bag backstage somewhere.

127
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,560
She was unable to be freed during the press conference.

128
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,560
Hopefully sufficiently beaten.

129
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,560
Aw, poor thing.

130
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,240
She's just trying to do her job.

131
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,240
I don't know.

132
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,240
What do we want to talk about?

133
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,240
Just each press conference?

134
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,240
Or do we want to...

135
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,400
Well, I want to talk about my gaming week because I played about 40 games this week.

136
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,400
So let's get started.

137
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,400
We'll take your time.

138
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,400
All right.

139
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,400
No, no.

140
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,400
I'm not going to repeat.

141
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,040
Oh, I will talk about something because it is gaming related, but not video games.

142
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:19,060
I've been working on the baby's room some more and doing stuff regarding that.

143
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:21,560
I'm building a custom mobile.

144
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,800
I've actually done the wiring for it and it works perfectly.

145
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,760
Well, except for yesterday because I broke it, but that was just from trying to show

146
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,880
people and the wire came off, but I can fix that.

147
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,180
Anyway, so I have this thing now where if I flip a switch, an on-off switch, it basically

148
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:39,760
plays an MP3 lullaby of the Super Mario Brothers theme.

149
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,860
At the same time, it will also spin a motor.

150
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:43,860
That's pretty awesome.

151
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:47,720
I'm going to shove it into an acrylic cube that's going to become a question block and

152
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,800
hang stuff from it.

153
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,080
And I've started drawing on the wall.

154
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:59,080
I posted on Twitter and Facebook the design I have for the room, which is looking like

155
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,200
new Super Mario Brothers.

156
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,200
That sounds so adorable.

157
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,200
I could barf, honestly.

158
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,720
It's going to be awesome.

159
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:10,280
I'm not going to recap everything I played at the actual E3 show because we had the daily

160
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,280
shows.

161
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,000
I'm sure a lot of them will come up as we go over tonight's news, which is going to

162
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,680
be a little more free for them tonight.

163
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,460
If you guys have questions in chat and during the Twitter topics and calls, if you want

164
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:22,920
to know if I touched a certain game, I'd be happy to give you my thoughts on it.

165
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:27,480
But one thing I think we all have to keep in mind about E3, and I sensed us during the

166
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:32,060
daily shows, sometimes veering off that path a little bit, we're looking at very early

167
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,060
builds of things.

168
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:37,180
And a lot of times the reason why companies want to have these, make an appointment to

169
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:40,480
see the game, or you're not going to play it, I'm going to play it for you, and all

170
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:45,600
this stuff, is because they don't want people to form 100% opinions about games from these

171
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,600
demos on the show floor.

172
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:52,160
I think it takes a lot of guts to put your game out there on the show floor at E3, guts

173
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,000
that clearly Activision and Blizzard don't have anymore from not having their booths

174
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,280
open to the public at E3.

175
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,320
But didn't they quit E3 last year?

176
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,920
Well, they still had a booth.

177
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:08,480
Most everything was behind closed doors at that booth, but they've been scaling further

178
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,480
and further back.

179
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,480
But I'm digressing a little bit.

180
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:16,220
I could go on this whole other tangent about BlizzCon and Blizzard, and how I am a big

181
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:21,200
stan of World of Warcraft, I love that game, it's amazing, I am not fucking going to BlizzCon

182
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,200
ever.

183
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,200
Ever.

184
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,200
Because it's a joke.

185
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,140
They should have just had a big sign out front of their booth that says, seriously, you've

186
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:32,600
seen this stuff before, it's just more of the same.

187
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,880
Well anyway, I'm getting off the path a little bit.

188
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,720
Because I actually did play games that weren't just at E3, so I want to get those out of

189
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:43,420
the way, because I know most of the people listening to this show didn't go to E3, so

190
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:47,640
you guys are probably playing a lot of standby games to catch up on, just like I was.

191
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:51,400
So I will mention this, I played, you might remember a couple weeks on the show, I said,

192
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,320
I'm going to beat three games this summer.

193
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:56,260
And I'm falling a little behind on my goal, but I finally found a game I want to play

194
00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:01,040
to completion after getting about a third of the way through it.

195
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:08,760
I played Alan Wake, which is a game that was a long time in the making, it was from Microsoft

196
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:14,560
Game Studios, one of their internal development teams that created the game.

197
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:21,800
I guess you could say it's Microsoft's answer to Silent Hill, but a little less of the crazy

198
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:28,580
creatures and things of that sort, and a little more of the strange paranormal sort of stuff.

199
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:32,980
I really like how immersive the game feels to me, I like a lot of the small touches that

200
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,080
they've done with the game.

201
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:39,240
There's these little TVs that when you come across them will play little episodes of The

202
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,800
Twilight Zone, or at least kind of their version of that.

203
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:47,640
I think they call it Night Springs, is what they call it, which Shane pointed out to me,

204
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:51,280
is because the town name is called Bright Falls, so Night Springs is like the opposite

205
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:54,400
of that, and I didn't catch that right away, it's funny.

206
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:59,320
I really love the fog effects, they're very scary, and I think they're done very well.

207
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,480
And I think it's a survival horror game, it's pretty cool, it's immersive, it feels like

208
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:08,760
you're watching a TV show, and it's been compared to Twin Peaks in other places, and I think

209
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:13,040
that's a very fair comparison, because you have a lot of those eccentric characters,

210
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:20,760
strange stories, WTF is going on feeling, and yeah, I'm really liking Alan Wake so far,

211
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,480
it's a good game.

212
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,760
Lots of little things to collect for achievements and so forth, great environments to interact

213
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,440
with, very large environments where you'll be walking down a trail, and then suddenly

214
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,280
you get in a car and drive to the other side of the map, and this is all seamless, where

215
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:41,200
you maybe started the mission earlier, but everything has changed since you were gone,

216
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,040
but there's no loading in between all of this, so the map is kind of changing dynamically

217
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,200
as you're away, which I think is very cool.

218
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,680
So yeah, I've been really enjoying Alan Wake.

219
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,520
I'm looking forward to seeing some of the download content they're gonna put with that.

220
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,400
So I'll tell you more about the game when I get a little closer to completing, because

221
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:02,360
some of the reviews I have read about the game online really razzed the ending, but

222
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,440
I don't want to read what the ending is, because I'm really into the story right now, and I'm

223
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,520
trying to find my own theories about what's happening, so when I do beat this game, I

224
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,520
will kind of come back and let you know if I was as disappointed as some of the other

225
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,520
reviewers were.

226
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,920
Well, they also have the episodic content that's coming out port 2, I think, should

227
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:17,920
be interesting.

228
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,160
Oh yeah, there's at least two coming out, but they have a countdown timer in the game

229
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,680
to when the first one's coming out.

230
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:27,120
By the way, the game has major product placement, which I found very, very shameless product

231
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:33,000
placement, like Alan Wake uses a Verizon telephone, the car that he's driving in one scene has

232
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,940
sync by Microsoft in it, and Energizer batteries are what you use in light, which is a very

233
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,160
interesting battle mechanic.

234
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,720
It's not like Silent Hill where you kind of have to run away from everything, you can

235
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:48,720
do that, but it's very much a kind of light versus dark sort of thing in Alan Wake, and

236
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,240
the goal is you have to burn them down with your flashlight, and then they're vulnerable

237
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,760
to get shot, and you can kind of go through and kill things, but you can use light from

238
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:01,040
different sources, not just your flashlight, but you can use the headlights on a car, you

239
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,920
could attract the monsters towards a pole that has light shining from it, and it would

240
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,920
burn them down.

241
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,940
It's very interesting.

242
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:12,480
I'm surprised that Energizer would agree to have their batteries in a game where you have

243
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,120
to keep collecting batteries because they keep running out really fast.

244
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:21,080
It's like, uh, shouldn't I just collect one Energizer battery and be done with it for

245
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,080
the whole game?

246
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,400
I mean, isn't that the message we're trying to send across?

247
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:29,080
Well, if you don't burn your batteries by, because you can focus the light energy on

248
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:32,880
a monster and that burns your batteries real quick, but if you don't do that, you can burn

249
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,800
them down very slowly, although it's tough to dodge in that way, and then your batteries

250
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,520
slowly recharge.

251
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:42,920
So if you're kind of smart about the way you do it, you don't ever burn through a battery,

252
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:47,840
because you just burn it down, slowly recharge, burn it down again, recharge, but sometimes

253
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,040
it just becomes too much chaos.

254
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,120
Okay, that's just witchcraft now.

255
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:55,080
Well, maybe that's the trick, I don't know.

256
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,080
So yeah, Alan Wake, I had a good time with that.

257
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:00,360
So that's one of the games I've been playing outside of the whole E3 show.

258
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,920
Also we took a trip to Arcade Infinity one of the nights we were there at E3 just to

259
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,360
go, you know, see what's new over there.

260
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,720
What's new over there?

261
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:12,680
Well, new versions of all the same damn games we've been playing for ten years.

262
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:18,440
I played Guitar Freaks X, what the hell are they on now, X5 I think?

263
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,440
I don't know.

264
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,440
I just lost count.

265
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,440
Doesn't matter.

266
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,240
It's the same game I played ten years ago, just with new music, so whatever, it was fine.

267
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,240
I played D2Max Technica.

268
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,800
But don't the X games have like the, uh, No way, I didn't play it myself, I watched

269
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,800
Shane play it.

270
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,800
I thought I was playing it in my head.

271
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:36,680
Were the X games the ones that have like the extra buttons on it, or is that the different

272
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,680
one I'm thinking of?

273
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,680
No, it's just three buttons.

274
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:42,880
I'm thinking the DX ones or something, or GX, or, I don't know what the hell it's called.

275
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,120
Who cares, it's damn Guitar Freaks.

276
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:48,120
I played Pop and Music the movie, I don't even know what version of the game that is.

277
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,520
It's like 16 or something.

278
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:53,840
Whatever, I played that for a little bit, and, you know, playing big buttons.

279
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:59,280
See Konami, this is the game you can put out 16 versions of, not beat and groovy.

280
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,720
I don't understand why you're getting confused.

281
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:05,040
How do we make this game again?

282
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,960
And then I played a little bit of DJ Max, because Shane made me, because I was like,

283
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,960
oh, there's actually some songs in Technica I really like, and he's like, really?

284
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:14,400
You gotta play DJ Max on the PSP, you can play these songs, and he's like, you can do

285
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,680
four buttons and five buttons and six buttons.

286
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:20,360
So I ended up playing a little bit of that too, and he was strongly encouraging me to

287
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:24,160
buy DJ Max on the PSP, which I might do, maybe at some point.

288
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,160
There were some songs I liked.

289
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,160
It's not worth it.

290
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,160
Really?

291
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,160
I've tried it on PSP.

292
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,480
You can get it for like, with all the sales going on right now and used and everything,

293
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,480
like ten bucks?

294
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,480
Eh, that might even be worth it then.

295
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,480
So.

296
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,480
Alright.

297
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,560
So that was the games outside of E3 that I played.

298
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:40,840
I don't know, you guys wanna know, just here in studio, about anything at E3?

299
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:44,320
Were you curious about any of the stuff, the games there, that you might have heard I got

300
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,920
my hands on?

301
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,160
Marvel vs. Capcom 3, did you try that at all?

302
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,160
I did.

303
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,640
They had about ten characters playable on the show floor.

304
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,120
I got to actually play it twice.

305
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,080
The lines were excruciatingly long at Capcom's booth, but the game was also at Microsoft's

306
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:04,720
booth and Sony's booth, and so the lines were much shorter at Microsoft's booth.

307
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,720
So I did play it.

308
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:10,460
I had a team of like, Ryu, Morgan, Felicia in one of them, and I used like Deadpool in

309
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:13,720
another one, just for Jamie, you know, because I know she'd be happy if I did that.

310
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,700
And I think I used Captain America.

311
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:18,440
And you know, I'm not super into this series.

312
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:24,320
I was always more of a Capcom vs. SNK fan, but it played a lot like 2 to me, it just

313
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,160
had more stylistic graphics.

314
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,160
I like the way it looks.

315
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:32,680
It didn't flip into that 3D as much as I thought it would, like Street Fighter IV does, you

316
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,680
know what I mean?

317
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,440
Like I mean, it's not a 3D game, but you know how Street Fighter IV, like a lot of it has

318
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,440
the 3D elements?

319
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,680
It didn't do that as much as I thought it would, I mean during some of the specials

320
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:44,560
and so forth, but I think if you're a fan of Marvel vs. Capcom 2, you're not going to

321
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,560
be disappointed.

322
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:52,320
It's a high def, widescreen, cel-shaded, stylistic game, and I'm sure y'all will be happy.

323
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,320
I am.

324
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,320
Can't wait.

325
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:59,840
Jamie, now, did you see the extended trailer that they had for Marvel vs. Capcom 3?

326
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:03,080
The one that included Deadpool vs. Dante?

327
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:06,600
You had that in there, but did you see where he gets attacked by Morgan or...?

328
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,320
Yeah, see, that's ex- I saw the Iron Man vs. Morgan.

329
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,960
Well, there's an extended trailer that's all those little cutscenes or whatever.

330
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:20,840
He has one part where he gets attacked by her, she has like those spikes or whatever

331
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:24,920
that come out, and they hit him in the ass.

332
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,480
Dante looked like a badass character.

333
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,520
Shane was playing as Dante, and he was whooping me, and it took like two of my characters

334
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:35,440
to bring Dante down, but then I guess Chris is either really hard to use or just stinks

335
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,000
or something, because I took him out like that, and then we were even again.

336
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Probably really hard to use.

337
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Yeah.

338
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,160
What's his face from Dead Rising?

339
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,160
Frank West?

340
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,160
Yeah, Frank West.

341
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,520
He was not in the demo, so I couldn't tell you.

342
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:53,320
But I will say Dead Rising 2, full of lols.

343
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:58,120
I like the Fortune City setting for it, the Vegas is a cool little setting for it.

344
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:01,480
One of the weapons we saw used on zombies was great.

345
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:06,680
It was like this, okay, imagine like an old style lawn mower that you have to do manually,

346
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,140
but it's motorized on the bottom instead.

347
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:12,920
So like you could pick this up, and then like he would push it into the zombie and chop

348
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,920
him in half.

349
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,920
Maybe like a mulcher?

350
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,920
Yeah, like a mulcher type of thing.

351
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,920
It was awesome.

352
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,920
I laughed my ass off.

353
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,920
They had that in the first game, sort of.

354
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,920
Well, it was different.

355
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,200
It was like an actual lawn mower that I remember.

356
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:26,160
I have a feeling Dead Rising 2 is really just kind of more of the same, but it was, we laughed.

357
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,160
Who cares?

358
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,160
It's a great formula.

359
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,160
We laughed and laughed.

360
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,200
There's only one thing they needed to do, and that was just fix the save system.

361
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,200
That's done.

362
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,200
We're good.

363
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,880
Look into our chat room at chat.orangelawnsradio.com if you're listening to us live on Sunday

364
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,880
night.

365
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,880
Why not come join us?

366
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,040
We have a question from chat about questions and comments.

367
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:46,640
Tiger Claw says, I like how Deadpool yells, you press the wrong button when he loses in

368
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,640
the game.

369
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,440
I didn't see that, but it's so loud on the show floor.

370
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,400
You can't really hear a lot of the games.

371
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,320
I will say, though, one of the soundtracks that sounded like I could hear was the Tron

372
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,800
game that they were demoing at the Disney booth.

373
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,200
I played the Tron game on PlayStation 3.

374
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,840
Okay, here's what it is.

375
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:08,360
Imagine Prince of Persia got totally reskinned with Tron graphics.

376
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,680
That's what the fucking Tron game is.

377
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:13,840
See, I thought it was more of like the force unleashed in the Tron universe type thing.

378
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,840
I know.

379
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,840
It played like Prince of Persia.

380
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:20,800
Like even the demo, you do the wall walking, the big flips, the jumping over objects.

381
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,720
It really felt like Prince of Persia to me.

382
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,680
But it used the Daft Punk soundtrack.

383
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,680
Like I could tell.

384
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,040
And so I'm like, oh, this has a sweet soundtrack to it.

385
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:32,840
It was very nice and very stylistic with the disks being thrown and everything going in

386
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,120
slow motion.

387
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:38,120
But I think a lot of people, like Shane, never saw Tron, and he's kind of looking at me playing

388
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,440
the game and he's going, the graphics in this suck.

389
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:43,120
And I'm like, it's Tron.

390
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,720
Their wire frame graphics is what it's supposed to look like.

391
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,720
He'll learn.

392
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,720
He didn't get it.

393
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,720
In due time.

394
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,720
I know.

395
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,720
He'll get it someday.

396
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,720
Let's see.

397
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,720
Other questions from chat.

398
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,220
Chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

399
00:18:54,220 --> 00:19:00,000
Some folks wanting to know, it looks like, who's asked it here?

400
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,720
Ray Iannami is saying it's yet another Symphony of the Night remake.

401
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,840
I guess they're talking about the Castlevania game.

402
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:07,440
Oh, Tigerclaw is asking, did you play the new Castlevania game?

403
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,840
I did.

404
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:15,160
It does use a lot of the same skins from Symphony of the Night and it plays very similar.

405
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:19,960
But yet at the same time, it feels a lot different because it has what I call this Neo Geo effect

406
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:23,080
where it zooms in and out of parts of the castle.

407
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,080
Mode 7!

408
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,080
Well, you can control that.

409
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,440
It's not arbitrary.

410
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:32,000
You control that by clicking the left or the right button, one of them.

411
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,840
You would actually control that.

412
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,020
But I found it very hard to get through the maze.

413
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:38,120
It was a hard rush for 10 minutes.

414
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:41,280
The problem with the game is that no one was really explaining the game to us and there

415
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,560
was no on-screen rules or whatever in the demo so we just kind of had to figure it out.

416
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,320
And yeah, it really did feel a lot like Symphony of the Night.

417
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,640
But the multiplayer element does seem to add something pretty cool to it.

418
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:54,360
And yes, you can do co-op or competitive.

419
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,360
So that's kind of fun.

420
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,560
I think it'll be a fun little arcade title.

421
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,880
Depends what they charge for it.

422
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,120
If they try to charge like 30 bucks for it, no.

423
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,120
It's gonna be $15.

424
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,120
$15 is fine.

425
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,120
Probably.

426
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,120
It seems like it'll be a good deal for $15.

427
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,320
$15 is a new five.

428
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:11,960
The other Castlevania game, I can tell, was not a Castlevania game when it started.

429
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:17,400
It looked a lot more like God of War or Bayonetta, but it's really pretty.

430
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,400
And it's very stylistic.

431
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,880
And it has sparkle ponies.

432
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:25,640
And it has Patrick Stewart, excuse me, Sir Patrick Stewart doing some of the voiceover

433
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,520
works in little in-between montages.

434
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,520
But there was this cool little sequence.

435
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,260
I want him to be a playable character.

436
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:34,640
There was this cool little sequence where like you're on a wolf that's kind of riding

437
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:40,380
and you can jump onto the other wolf and throw the guy off and it's, it's, Castlevania meets

438
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,380
God of War.

439
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:46,600
But I think if people are expecting like an old school Castlevania game, the arcade game's

440
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,600
for you.

441
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,600
Not this new one.

442
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,400
This new one is a different direction for the series.

443
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,320
I wonder if they call that level Operation Wolf.

444
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,880
Um, let's see.

445
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,880
Other comments.

446
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:03,160
Oh, it looks like some folks are asking about the 3D Castlevania game there as well.

447
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,160
Let's see.

448
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,320
They're asking about the Tron.

449
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,680
Tiger class says, hopefully the multiplayer will kick ass.

450
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,540
Like if they have the classic light cycle versus light cycle from the original Tron

451
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,560
in 3D.

452
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,960
That's the Wii game.

453
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:17,140
The Wii game had a whole little light cycle thing in 3D.

454
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,720
That is exactly what the Wii game is.

455
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,720
So there you go.

456
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,280
Well, no, it's gonna have that also in the other ones.

457
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,280
Oh, they were showing that in the demo.

458
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,440
They were probably just showing different levels.

459
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,440
Yeah.

460
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,440
Most likely.

461
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,440
Most likely.

462
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,840
I could tell the graphical difference though between the Wii and the other ones.

463
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,840
Well Tron is supposed to be in 3D also in the PlayStation 3 version.

464
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,640
I'm not sure about the 360 though.

465
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,920
I will tell you about a couple other games just kind of off the top of my head.

466
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,380
There's a few that I want to talk about for sure.

467
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:43,960
A couple of them are music based so bear with me a minute.

468
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:48,240
Rock Band 3 is gonna be a worthy upgrade.

469
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,120
They talked very quickly about some of the stylistic changes that they've made to the

470
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:57,480
menus where you really see your band kind of grow up on the main menu.

471
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:02,360
They've talked about how they have a new condensed mode where you can basically do the entire

472
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:05,320
band from start to finish in about four hours worth of gameplay.

473
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:09,400
So it's like an instant rock band party basically if you want to invite people over.

474
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:14,520
And I think most importantly as the rock band library has been growing and so forth, they

475
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:17,560
have put in filters on the song list.

476
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:22,480
And I know a lot of people are wondering this, all of the rock band songs are importable

477
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,940
into Rock Band 3 with the exception of the Beatles which I don't think comes as a surprise

478
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:26,940
to anyone.

479
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:32,100
But this Uber machine that they were playing on had Rock Band 2, Lego Rock Band, Green

480
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,520
Day Rock Band, I mean everything else was importable.

481
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:38,380
This Uber machine they were playing on had like 1300 songs, it was nuts.

482
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:40,120
I know all about that.

483
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:45,320
The realistic mode, I didn't understand it at all on guitar because I don't play the

484
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,320
guitar.

485
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:51,760
Guitar seemed really confusing, essentially 120, I mean I'm sure it's just like, yeah

486
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,760
I don't know how to play the guitar.

487
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:57,520
I don't know how to play the guitar but watching the guy play that White Stripes song and then

488
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:01,900
they plugged in an amp at the same time, they like doubled, because there's two guitar peripherals.

489
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:05,000
One of them has all the buttons and then the other one's like a real guitar that you can

490
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,340
use to play rock band basically in this special mode and I guess they double jacked it into

491
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:14,400
the game and the amp and what they did, they turned down the game volume and turned up

492
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,560
the amp and he was playing the White Stripes song, it was like the real song.

493
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:21,480
So I think this will answer a lot of people's calls like, well if you, and especially like

494
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:26,040
music, you know music snobs and people in the bands, Rock Band isn't real guitar playing.

495
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:30,960
It is funny though, like that game Power Gig gets announced way back and everyone's like

496
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,240
oh my god you know it's a game that's going to teach you how to play guitar and then Rock

497
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:39,240
Band 3 comes out, oh it's exactly the same thing, ah crap.

498
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:42,520
But I will say one instrument I know a little more about is the keyboards and getting to

499
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:45,320
see the real keyboard mode, I was like whoa cool.

500
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:48,880
I do want to correct one thing I had said, speculated I guess I should say earlier on

501
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,960
the show and that is when you're playing in the five bar mode, I think that's what they

502
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:57,520
call it, the five bar mode, which is you know like regular rock band on the keyboard, it

503
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:02,800
is not the color bars that you see at the top of the keyboard, you use right in the

504
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:07,240
middle, you use middle C, D, E, F, G, for those of you guys that know your piano, you're

505
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:10,880
basically using just five keys right next to each other to play five bar mode.

506
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,340
You're only going to use the full keyboard if you actually choose to play in pro mode.

507
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:18,640
But I, as a keyboard player many many many many years ago, I was in heaven, I thought

508
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,640
it was great.

509
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,640
I think it looks awesome.

510
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,640
Looks awesome.

511
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:27,760
Dr. 945 in our chat room, chat.orangetongue.com, excuse me, The Dr. 945 says have you guys

512
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:31,240
seen the complete track list wall, that's a lot of songs on rock band, yes it was in

513
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:34,880
their booth, it was right across from where we were playing rock band three, it is very

514
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,600
impressive and they also had a bar graph, I don't know if that made it into the pictures

515
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:42,280
as well, that says here's how many they have in rock band, here's how many are in guitar

516
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:47,120
hero, it was a lot less.

517
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:52,000
I really really didn't want to like Dance Central, but I do.

518
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,160
The Kinect games, because I kind of, and I'll let Loki kind of cover Microsoft's press conference

519
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:00,800
and some of the highlights and lowlights in a minute, but I think a lot of us walked away

520
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:05,520
from Microsoft's press conference kind of going, oh these Kinect seem like the gimmicky

521
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:10,300
crap we saw on the Wii a couple years ago, but you know what, getting up there and actually

522
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:15,360
playing Dance Central was actually kind of fun and moving back and forth and it wasn't

523
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,560
as complicated as I thought it was going to be from first looking at it to follow the

524
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:23,960
guy on the screen, it kind of felt like doing aerobics in a way, and I think that's the

525
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,580
Kinect's biggest strength, it's going to be exergaming heaven is what it is.

526
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:33,320
If you've ever taken a dance class, it's basically how they break it down in a dance class, basically

527
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:40,160
like a long time ago in high school I took a street dance class during, it was like sophomore

528
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:44,560
year or something, and it was fun for like a summer, and basically what they do is they

529
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:49,720
teach you small little bits, like different techniques or whatever, and then you string

530
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:53,400
it together in a routine, and that's basically what this game is, they teach you a bunch

531
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:57,640
of small techniques and then you string it together in a routine, which is cool, I think

532
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:03,680
that's, I mean, I'm not sure if I would actually play this a lot because my wife would just

533
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:09,200
not get it, she would just be like, you look like a dumbass, I can see it right now, and

534
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:14,180
it would be kind of fun though, I still may get it anyways, but god no it's not going

535
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:19,880
to ever appear on the internet with me in a video, never ever, unless I get really good

536
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:24,560
at it, in which case, maybe, but even still, no.

537
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:30,040
So I mean that's kind of cool, and the song list looks pretty cool on it, but if we're

538
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:35,240
going to compare it to say Dance Masters, let me put it this way, if you took what you

539
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:39,760
learned from Dance Central and actually went to a club and did it, you might look alright,

540
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:44,040
you took Dance Masters and did what they have in that game, you're going to look like an

541
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,040
idiot.

542
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:49,760
Well I don't know if I go that far, because I think it was hard to see, and I wanted to

543
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:55,280
get into Dance Masters, but for me the biggest difference between the two games is, yeah

544
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:58,600
the style of dance was definitely different between the two, but it's the song list, and

545
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:04,300
that's really what it's going to ultimately come down to, and if Dance Masters continues

546
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:09,080
down this path of DDR looking songs, there's going to be a niche audience for it, which

547
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:13,800
is most of the people that have grown up with this show for the past 8 years since we started

548
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:18,880
talking exclusively about DDR, but Dance Central will be the game that sells superior to it

549
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,700
in America anyway.

550
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:23,960
I don't think Dance Central is even going to come out in Japan, and I think Dance Masters

551
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:24,960
will rule over there.

552
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,980
Here's the thing though about Dance Masters, and actually Dance Central, I'd be more willing

553
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:33,140
to back Dance Central because I know how harmonics is with download content.

554
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:35,520
They will deliver on download content.

555
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:40,360
Konami, they've promised to deliver on download content for every single dance game that's

556
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:46,320
come out, even the Karaoke Revolution games that have come out, never have they actually

557
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,320
come through.

558
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:51,400
It's just been, oh we'll put out a couple things to download content, we're done.

559
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:56,640
Oh yeah we promised you all this stuff, but like fuck if they're going to deliver it.

560
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,000
Well two things I think are important to say about Dance Masters, one of them is that,

561
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,320
and I mentioned this on one of the daily shows this week, the Rob Roberts and Pals that were

562
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:08,180
on the feed earlier this week, I got served a nice slice of humble pie this week because

563
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:13,520
something I probably said back in 02 or 03 in the early early days of OLR, I know I clearly

564
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:19,400
said, get over it, Para Para Paradise is never coming to the US, absolutely will not happen.

565
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:23,720
Sure enough here we are seven, eight years later, Dance Masters is basically Para Para

566
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,720
Paradise.

567
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:29,540
I mean they're going to tell you different songs, it's not all Europe-y, professionally

568
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:31,880
choreographed, but it's still the wrong way.

569
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:37,000
Here's my thing, because the only song that I saw, I mean they have like two songs that

570
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,680
they showed, they showed one it was some Naoki Smile Decay song, and they had another one

571
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,120
that was Night of Fire.

572
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:49,120
Now I can understand if those maybe have Para dancing to them because it's more Japanese,

573
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,800
the Para Club stuff.

574
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:57,080
Now the other songs that are in the game that say are other genres of music, do those have

575
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:02,800
different types of dancing, different styles, because that might be kind of alright.

576
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:08,080
If it's all Para, like if it's Para to some Pink song or something like that, that's a

577
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,160
little weird.

578
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:13,920
If it's actually different styles, like if they have country songs with country dancing

579
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:20,040
to it, or if they've got hip hop songs with more street jazz type stuff in there, that

580
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,260
makes sense.

581
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:25,360
But if it's just all this Para style dancing, that's kind of weird.

582
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:29,380
I actually thought though, I will say this, I actually thought Dance Masters was the more

583
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:34,280
graphically appealing game in kind of looking at them both side to side.

584
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:38,320
I think in the end, Dance Central was the more easier to follow kind of dance, but I

585
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:42,440
thought Dance Masters kind of looked better in some ways.

586
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,440
It's hard to explain.

587
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,400
I think a lot of people are probably going to just end up picking up both, especially

588
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:50,840
the crowd that I think mostly listens to this show, but I think ultimately Dance Central

589
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,280
is going to prevail in the scales here.

590
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,520
I'll check out the other one, but I'll pick up Dance Central.

591
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,960
Dance Masters will do better overseas.

592
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,960
Well absolutely.

593
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,920
But yeah, I had a good time with those games.

594
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,920
So let's see, those were the music games.

595
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:05,280
How about something for the non-music game fans?

596
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,280
Because this was...

597
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:10,520
Real quick, I was going to say one thing, I mean it wasn't shown on the floor or anything,

598
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:16,360
but one of the games I saw footage of that I thought was really awesome is DJ Hero 2

599
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:20,600
that they're going to be doing, well the karaoke part, cool, whatever.

600
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:24,720
But I do like all the different stuff that they have now where the samples that you do

601
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:29,680
during the freestyle portions are actually part of the song, it's not just crappy flava

602
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:32,000
flave samples over top of everything.

603
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,820
And also the freestyle scratching, the freestyle cross-fading stuff looks pretty cool.

604
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:40,720
You know what game unfortunately I did not get my hands on but Shane did and he swears

605
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,160
it was probably one of the best games he played at the show?

606
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,680
DJ Hero 3D.

607
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:48,280
Yes, I actually want to pick that up.

608
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,280
Looks awesome.

609
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:54,560
From what I understand it was a really great experience on the 3DS, so I wish I'd seen

610
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:57,040
it myself but no I got to play some other stuff.

611
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:01,760
I think I played Sims 3 on the 3DS actually, funny enough, which takes your picture and

612
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:05,240
then builds your little Sims character to look like you.

613
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,240
To look like your picture?

614
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,200
Yes, do you know how huge my nose was?

615
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,520
I was a little offended actually.

616
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:15,840
That's still a pretty cool feature, hope they have that in the other versions.

617
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,840
That's pretty cool.

618
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,520
I just don't want to see how fat my Sim's going to be.

619
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,520
Well luckily it only takes pictures of your face.

620
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,520
Cannot fit on screen.

621
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,520
It only takes pictures of your face, luckily.

622
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:27,240
I'm like, I have more hair left than that, what are you telling me?

623
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:32,760
That's for the 3DS version, you never know with these Kinect cameras and move and stuff.

624
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:37,000
Alright so some folks in chat seem to be getting confused, let's also just clarify.

625
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:43,280
Harmonix is making Dance Central, which is more of the do this for 8 counts, do this

626
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:47,820
for 4 counts, do this for 16 counts type of dance game, breaking it down.

627
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:54,920
Dance Masters is the Konami game that functions a little more like Para Para, but when I say

628
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:59,040
that, it's not 6 streams that you break, it is nothing like that at all, it is tracing

629
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,440
motions on the screen and posing in certain ways.

630
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,400
It's like Para Para and Elite Beat Agents combined.

631
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:07,520
Yes, that's a good way of describing it actually.

632
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:11,320
How about some non-music games for a minute, because there's one that really surprised

633
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,320
me at the show.

634
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,320
Don't they exist?

635
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,320
Yes.

636
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:18,560
By the way, Jamie, since you have the mic up for a minute, I want to ask you, is there

637
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,240
a dance game that you're going to pick up?

638
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,800
Or are you like, no thank you, I don't really want to dance, or what?

639
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:27,200
No I think that I want to play Para Para at home, and it's actually kind of funny because

640
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,680
just a few days ago I was thinking about hooking up the biscuits.

641
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:33,760
Now what you should have done is done the, because you probably know the Night of Fire

642
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,200
routine, right?

643
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,120
No, not by heart.

644
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,840
Oh, well.

645
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:39,840
What about Sheen?

646
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,840
No, Sheen doesn't play Para.

647
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:41,840
No, no.

648
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,800
I would have been able to do Boom Boom Fire is probably the only one I still remember

649
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,800
after all these years.

650
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:51,900
Hey, I went and played the Para around the corner from, you know, on Arcadia, and I remembered

651
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:52,900
my stuff.

652
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:55,120
I could shake my butt.

653
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:58,760
I probably could have remembered with the stuff on the screen, but why did I need to

654
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,760
do it?

655
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,480
Bobby Black Wolf, there's a video of him on the internet doing the Night of Fire routine.

656
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,480
You should have done it.

657
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,820
Free publicity, Rob.

658
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:08,800
When I got up there, Shane specifically said, you better not play Night of Fire.

659
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,800
So I did the Smile DK song.

660
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,800
Thank you, Shane.

661
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,800
Thank you.

662
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:12,800
Thank you.

663
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:13,800
All right.

664
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:14,800
Look, I want to get past this.

665
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:17,560
I do want to say this, though, because somebody who was doing the Night of Fire dance right

666
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:21,080
there at the booth the day I was there, Naoki was there on the floor.

667
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,080
I got a picture with him.

668
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,080
I got to put it on Facebook.

669
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:28,120
I promised you, if I had a chance to meet Naoki, I would ask him one question, and that

670
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:30,440
question is, and this is how the interaction went.

671
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:33,160
I said, you know, hi there, can I get a picture?

672
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,400
And then he said, you know, thank you.

673
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,520
And I said, hold on, just one question.

674
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:40,180
I said, is that Facebook really you?

675
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:43,000
And he doesn't speak very good English, he was kind of like Facebook.

676
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,560
And I was like, Facebook?

677
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:47,920
And I kind of pointed to my phone, because I don't know how else to describe Facebook.

678
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,640
I'm like, is it you?

679
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:52,240
And I'm kind of like pointing on Facebook.

680
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,920
And he's like, oh, yes, yes, me on Facebook.

681
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,280
And so yes, that Naoki Facebook is really him.

682
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:03,000
They made the mistake, and I kind of feel bad, you know, they made the mistake of him

683
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,820
actually speaking during the Konami press conference.

684
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:09,200
And that was the most weird thing.

685
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,200
He's adorable.

686
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,200
Come on.

687
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,200
I know he's adorable, but he doesn't speak good English.

688
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:19,160
So give the guy a damn translator, you know, same with the guy that was describing 99 Nights.

689
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:26,600
If you keep pushing X button and Y button, the game will suck, or you will be sucked.

690
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:30,280
Come on, dude, I need a translator.

691
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,280
Don't just let this guy wing it.

692
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:36,320
Do not hate on Naoki on this show, he is adorable.

693
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,780
He looks like, you know what he looks like a person, a hyper little kitty cat.

694
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:42,440
He was running around the stage, taking little pictures of his iPhone.

695
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:45,760
He was so happy that people were playing the game and having fun with it.

696
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,760
He was so happy.

697
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:51,500
You know, and more props to him, and I know it's not his fault that some of the last DDR

698
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:55,800
games have really been terrible, and you know, and I kind of feel bad in that sense, because

699
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:59,740
they've taken what he created and just kind of took a big dump on it, like they did with

700
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:01,440
Beaten Groovy.

701
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:05,960
But it's just, it's not, it's very awkward, okay?

702
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:10,480
They had a lot of awkward moments during the Konami press conference, speaking of which,

703
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:15,720
and I know it's just kind of like, eh, whatever, Glee, karaoke revolution game.

704
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,320
Worst game I played at E3.

705
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:20,000
Yes, I played it, and it's terrible.

706
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,080
And I officially don't give a crap about Glee.

707
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:27,080
It was one of those things when we walked in Konami's booth and I kind of looked over

708
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:31,600
and I saw, I mean, it's huge, it was no secret, I was like, I kind of did that moment of,

709
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:35,200
of course, of course, I should have fucking seen that coming, I should have known.

710
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,920
Did I have Shane play Def Jam Rapstar?

711
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,160
No, no, no, no.

712
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,880
Here's why the Glee game was bad.

713
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:45,240
They've basically just done away with the character models and everything.

714
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:49,240
It just plays videos from Glee that sometimes match up with the song and sometimes just

715
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,760
completely random videos.

716
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:55,400
And it just, it's, it's not that great.

717
00:35:55,400 --> 00:36:00,080
I think I sat there, I think we sang, like, I don't even know what song we sang, but I

718
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:03,600
was singing like this, I was going,

719
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,600
Perfect!

720
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,600
Yeah, 95%.

721
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:08,840
Granted, I was on the easiest level, but geez.

722
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:09,840
All right.

723
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,840
All right.

724
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,840
Please, a non-music game.

725
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:12,840
Please, please, please.

726
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,440
May I talk about a non-music game?

727
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,440
No.

728
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,960
Because there was a non-music game I played at the show.

729
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,640
Child of Eden looks awesome, by the way.

730
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,640
I'm done.

731
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:20,640
Shut up!

732
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:21,640
It does look very awesome.

733
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:22,640
It has Kinky Rockets in it.

734
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,640
They're doing the soundtrack.

735
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,640
Shup, shup.

736
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,640
Dude, I love Kinky Rockets.

737
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:26,640
Hey!

738
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:27,640
Hey, listen.

739
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:32,600
Let me say this, because this is a game you would expect dark soccer to walk away from

740
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,360
the show going, I really like this game.

741
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:42,560
But it was me that walked away from the demo for DC Universe going, that PVP was a hell

742
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,560
of a lot of fun.

743
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,560
Who'd you play?

744
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,120
Or did you make your own character?

745
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,120
It's all make your own character.

746
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,280
You cannot play as Batman or Wonder Woman or any of that.

747
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,520
They play as guys.

748
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:57,120
But all the raid gear, quote, unquote, is like clones of Wonder Woman and Superman and

749
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,120
all that.

750
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,920
So it looks like, you know, we didn't get to do too much of the character creation.

751
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:06,560
It was all PVP, but it looks like your characters can kind of go down a Batman-y path or a Wonder

752
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,160
Woman-y path.

753
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,000
And the guy who demoed it was really great.

754
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:15,200
He was one of the better demonstrators I was working with during E3.

755
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:19,080
He really was trying to kind of, he could tell we were WoW players, and he was kind

756
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:21,760
of just trying to break it down, like what some of the differences were.

757
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:25,960
And he said that they don't want people to be kind of pigeonholed into these tank and

758
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,480
healer and DPS roles.

759
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,480
They kind of want everybody to be able to do everything.

760
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,320
And I thought that was pretty cool.

761
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,160
I just liked, it was more action-based.

762
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,320
Here's the thing you need to keep in mind.

763
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,920
DC Universe is a much more action-based MMO.

764
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:41,080
Like the only action MMO I've really played to any extent is Phantasy Star Online and

765
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,080
Phantasy Star Universe.

766
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,080
I love PSO.

767
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:48,240
But I mean, the action in that is really super slow compared to DC Universe.

768
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:52,240
I mean, Phantasy Star is like sword, sword, sword.

769
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:56,840
You know, whereas DC Universe is like punch, punch, punch, ice storm, drink a soda to refuel

770
00:37:56,840 --> 00:38:01,520
and then fly up and I swear the best, the moment where I was like, I need to get this

771
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,160
game when it comes out November 2nd.

772
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,520
Part of the PVP we were doing, it was heroes versus villains, of course.

773
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,620
And all the people that were out on the show floor were basically the heroes.

774
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:15,660
The villains were the people in the private rooms getting screened the game.

775
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:20,160
And the guy was like, okay, I'm really not supposed to show you this, but okay, do this.

776
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,480
The game was trying to hold down these forts.

777
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:26,880
So it would be like heroes versus villains inside these little techy looking forts and

778
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,980
whoever can hold it down longer would win it.

779
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:31,600
He says, go fly onto the top of it.

780
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:36,080
There's an EMP device and hold down the circle button until it counts down to zero.

781
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,320
And so I did it.

782
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:41,160
And then while you are holding down the circle button, it flashes back to a scene of the

783
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,160
fortress.

784
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:47,240
And once the countdown hits zero, boom, all of the villains went flying out of the room

785
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:50,800
because the EMP device just, it's like a magnet thing that pushes them all out.

786
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,320
And I was like, that was fucking rad.

787
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,280
I can have this game now, please.

788
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,280
Yeah.

789
00:38:55,280 --> 00:39:00,360
And the greatest part was knowing that all those villains were the mucky muck oppressed

790
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:03,520
people in the super secret screenings.

791
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:07,440
So I had a really good time with DJ or DJ universe, DC universe.

792
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:11,640
So I want to pick that full game up when it comes out.

793
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,400
Final Fantasy 14, we had a demo of that as well.

794
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:19,360
Speaking of MMOs, the game looks astonishing.

795
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:23,520
I feel like this game is not as far along as they would like it to be.

796
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:28,840
I can also say, just knowing some people that are in the private alpha right now, the alpha

797
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:32,880
really does not run very smoothly right now, even on pretty high end computers with a lot

798
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:37,200
of gigs of RAM, none of the settings are changeable and the frame rates in the city is pretty

799
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,200
bad.

800
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,680
Granted, it's in an early alpha and what did I say before?

801
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:44,680
We shouldn't be forming our final opinions of games off of demos, but the Final Fantasy

802
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:48,680
14, there's a lot that I really like that they did with it.

803
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,280
The guild labs, I think, are great.

804
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:54,120
You can start quests out in the field and you can finish them right when you finish

805
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,120
them.

806
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:58,500
Monsters are marked, they're easy to find.

807
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:02,880
You can scale the difficulty of any quest you do so that you can either solo quests

808
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:03,880
or you can party.

809
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:04,880
Thank you.

810
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,880
I know, it seems like they've really fixed a lot of that.

811
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,360
As long as they got rid of the level cap quests, I'm good with that.

812
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:14,300
Now it's just a matter of making the game run smooth because even in the Uber, I was

813
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:20,440
noticing some frame rate issues and I like my games to run very smoothly so I was a little

814
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:23,720
antsy about that because the game's supposed to be coming out pretty soon, but I have a

815
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:26,720
bad feeling it's going to need to go back to the drawing board for some tweaks a little

816
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,640
bit to optimize it.

817
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:33,960
I will say this, as it stands right now, I'll pick that game up on the PS3 because that's

818
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,440
where they're going to have it optimized for.

819
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,520
I think PC is going to be too much of a variable.

820
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:41,520
Oh, did I mention one little unfortunate bombshell about DC Universe?

821
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:47,000
I don't know if this is out there a lot, but the PC and PS3 versions are not cross-server

822
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
at this time.

823
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,720
Yeah, that's what they said last year too.

824
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:53,560
And it sounds like a lot of the reason because of that, it's not that the developer doesn't

825
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:58,120
want to do it, but it sounds like a lot of the reason has to do with kind of balancing

826
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,120
issues.

827
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:03,560
It's really different when somebody's playing on the PS3 versus the PC.

828
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:06,600
And I do think Sony's kind of a little bit of a...

829
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,480
Did you play it on the PS3 or the PC?

830
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,760
I played it on the PS3.

831
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,760
Yeah, PS3 was actually pretty easy to control.

832
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,200
Yeah, I was very surprised.

833
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:17,080
For an action-y game, it was cool.

834
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:20,880
So, Tigerclaw in chat wants to know, and we're getting like 40 minutes into the show, we'll

835
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:24,140
get into some news here and stuff in a minute, Tigerclaw says, did you get a chance to check

836
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:25,480
out the new Twisted Metal?

837
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:29,920
I watched other people play it, but I am not the big fan of the series that Loki is and

838
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:30,920
so forth.

839
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:33,560
I was very excited that they talked about the new Twisted Metal.

840
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:37,720
But the thing is, they were showing off that Nuke mode, that seemed very confusing to me.

841
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:41,720
Or at least, the whole idea where there's people in helicopters and stuff, that just

842
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:42,720
didn't...

843
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,680
I didn't understand what they were doing.

844
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,700
I mean, it looks fun.

845
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:55,560
It looks like a slightly better-looking version of Twisted Metal Black, but I kind of want

846
00:41:55,560 --> 00:42:00,000
to see what just a normal game looks like, other than that deathmatch mode.

847
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,760
Because I liked Black a lot.

848
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,760
I loved...

849
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:07,000
I think that was one of the best Twisted Metal games besides Twisted Metal 2.

850
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,920
All right, let's get into kind of wrapping up the press conferences a little more officially

851
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:13,280
here than just little tidbits here and there.

852
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,920
I do want to say some housekeeping real quick, though, because we're 40 minutes into the

853
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:19,080
show, just now getting to housekeeping.

854
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:21,840
Next week is our eight-year anniversary of Orange Launch Radio.

855
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:26,120
Actually, technically, it's during the week this week, June 23rd, 2002 was our very first

856
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,120
show.

857
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,120
So happy eight week...

858
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,120
Or eight weeks.

859
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:31,720
Happy eight years to us next week.

860
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:34,280
This week seemed like so long.

861
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,240
We're not doing anything special for it, really.

862
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,320
Just the same old thing we usually do.

863
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:41,800
But just, you know, kind of want to thank our listeners for the support over the eight

864
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,560
years of this show.

865
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:46,080
There will be no show the week after that.

866
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:50,500
That next Sunday is the actual 4th of July, which of course is a holiday here in the States.

867
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:54,400
And just due to other things we all want to do that night, there will be no show on the

868
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,400
4th of July.

869
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:56,400
Okay?

870
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,400
So that's really it for housekeeping.

871
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:00,200
Otherwise, join us on Facebook, Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio.

872
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:02,480
Join us on Twitter, Twitter.com slash OLR.

873
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,360
We're still taking Twitter topics.

874
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:08,560
If you have a story you want to share or questions about E3 you want to ask, mailbag is always

875
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:09,560
open as well.

876
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:11,880
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

877
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:15,360
So the beginning of the show tonight, we want to keep it a little more freeform just in

878
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:20,160
kind of wrapping up what happened at E3 and kind of summarizing the press conferences

879
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:22,520
and what everybody kind of thought of the news.

880
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:25,320
Loki, what do you want to say about Microsoft?

881
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:30,400
Because they started everything off the first night before the actual floor show began.

882
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:36,520
Microsoft came out there and in a nutshell focused mostly on Kinect and a bunch of games

883
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:38,240
that we kind of already knew were coming.

884
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:44,880
There was no new games outside of Kinect that were announced besides the one game that,

885
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,600
I don't even remember the name of it now, that's what the type of impression it had

886
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:48,600
on me.

887
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:49,600
Yeah, I know what you're talking about.

888
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:55,080
The Crytek Microsoft game studios that I thought was 300 the game because that's what it looked

889
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:57,360
like, 300 the game.

890
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:00,840
So that'll be interesting because Crytek does some really good work.

891
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:04,280
Stuff that I thought was interesting about that press conference and we'll go over like

892
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:07,480
every, well not every little detail, but just some of the basic stuff.

893
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:17,200
The ESPN stuff coming to Xbox Live Marketplace, the actual streaming, I think is kind of cool.

894
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:21,020
Not for me perhaps because I don't give a crap about sports, but for people that do

895
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:27,080
like sports and there's a lot of them out there, I think that's kind of neat.

896
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:34,280
The whole movie Kinect thing where you can control stuff just by voice command almost

897
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:38,920
like sync and motion gestures and stuff like that, that's kind of neat.

898
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:42,680
Can I back up a little bit about the ESPN thing because it kind of goes in that whole

899
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:46,680
integrated television thing and I did think that was cool.

900
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:50,760
I'm not into sports either as much as other people.

901
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:54,840
I might put the local team in and just kind of try Sacramento Kings because that way I'll

902
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:57,640
know if my coworkers are going to be in a good mood or a bad mood the next day.

903
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:01,440
I'll kind of track that in the ESPN thing, but I don't think I'll use it for a lot more

904
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,440
other than that.

905
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:08,040
But what really disappointed me was that when we were talking about TV integration, I think

906
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:12,120
one of the things that Microsoft did so well in this past year was one versus 100 and there

907
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:14,920
was literally no news on that front.

908
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:18,280
Not that game, not any of the other types of games that they were talking about.

909
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:22,280
I was extremely disappointed that that subject didn't even come up.

910
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:25,800
Yeah, that's too bad.

911
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:29,240
But other stuff, obviously Kinect was pretty cool.

912
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:36,120
They shut off a bunch of different game demo examples with that, including of course Kinectimals,

913
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:37,400
which I think was pretty cool.

914
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:43,400
If you're going to do one of those sim animal games, that is seriously the way to do it.

915
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:44,680
To me, it was so well done.

916
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:48,320
I think it's going to be a really big game with kids.

917
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:56,240
And when you compare that to the iPad stuff, it just seems a little more natural to me

918
00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:02,720
instead of just trying to pet, trying to play with this augmented reality creature type

919
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:03,720
thing.

920
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:07,880
I don't know, it's like Milo in animal form almost.

921
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:09,240
I was bored watching it.

922
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:10,880
Yeah, but it's not meant for us.

923
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:14,440
Yeah, but I feel like hardcore gamers really got the shaft at Microsoft's thing.

924
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:15,440
We didn't get anything.

925
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,120
I mean, it was a bunch of games we already knew about.

926
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:20,720
Yeah, but they didn't have anything that was really meant for the hardcore gamer though

927
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:21,720
with Kinect.

928
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:24,320
And isn't that the mistake Nintendo made four years ago?

929
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:25,320
It is.

930
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:27,000
As recent as last year?

931
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:32,500
It's possibly that way, but they may be relying more on third parties to kind of do that stuff.

932
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:36,420
But the problem is they've got the hardcore audience right now.

933
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:39,700
They're not trying to bring in more people necessarily.

934
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:40,880
They have the hardcore gamers.

935
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:44,280
They don't need to worry about the hardcore gamers leaving because there's no Kinect games

936
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:45,280
for them.

937
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:49,400
They're trying to bring on the casual audience that's not playing the Xbox 360 right now.

938
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:53,320
I still kind of think, and I know some folks may argue with me and so forth because, you

939
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:57,100
know, the press conferences are for everybody and it's so that they can get the coverage

940
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:58,100
and so forth.

941
00:46:58,100 --> 00:46:59,720
But I'm like, but this is E3.

942
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:00,720
You know what I mean?

943
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:06,380
Like, you know, even CNN who's covering E3 sends their tech guys who play a lot of video

944
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:07,880
games to E3.

945
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:10,600
And I don't think there is on the up and up on a lot of this stuff.

946
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:15,080
I mean, if Xbox wants to show off a lot of these Kinect things, I mean, I understand

947
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:18,680
why it's a big part of the press conference, but some of these games could have been relegated

948
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:22,360
to, you know, being debuted on the Ellen show or something for the appropriate audience.

949
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:23,360
You know what I mean?

950
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:27,600
I just feel like it's not just the one versus a hundred thing, but a lot, I mean, no mention

951
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:34,040
of game room, which really doesn't surprise me, sadly, or just any other big holiday hardcore

952
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:40,320
titles that we didn't already know about was a little disappointing to me.

953
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:44,160
Honestly, I think it would have been better if they never announced Gears 3 a couple months

954
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,160
ago.

955
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:46,160
I think they should have kept it under wraps.

956
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:54,200
I don't think there was any advantage to them blowing that on the Jimmy Kimmel show or whatever,

957
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:57,400
no, the Jimmy Fallon show or whatever show it first showed up on.

958
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:03,440
Yeah, I understand that, but at the same time, you know, like I said, their focus with Kinect

959
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:06,040
is not necessarily the hardcore gamers.

960
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:09,440
They've already got them with, you know, the stuff that they have coming out.

961
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:14,120
And there will be stuff later on that will support the hardcore gamer crowd, but it should

962
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:17,240
just not going to be the launch stuff.

963
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:20,960
It's mainly just, you know, more of the casual audience that they're trying to capture in

964
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:24,560
and then, you know, maybe they'll convert some of the hardcore gamers over later on

965
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:28,080
to trying that stuff.

966
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:29,960
And so there's a lot of stuff that they show off there.

967
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:37,280
Obviously, you've got your Wii Sports clone, your Wii Sports Resort type thing with Kinect

968
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:41,880
Adventures, Kinect Sports, seriously, Kinect Sports, couldn't you have done something a

969
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:42,880
little bit different?

970
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:49,640
Call it Kinect Athletics or something like that, you know, it's just so much of a, almost

971
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:52,800
a rip-off, you know.

972
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:57,040
But again, as much as I'm sitting here going, boo press conference, then I got up there

973
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:01,280
and played Dance Central and I was like, okay, it's kind of fun, I got to admit, it's...

974
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:03,600
But yeah, that's more of a casual game though.

975
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:04,600
What's that, DarkSaga?

976
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:09,780
I'm looking at this picture that Tiger Claw linked from Go Nintendo of Miyamoto checking

977
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:14,040
out Kinect.

978
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:15,840
And does he look kind of pissed?

979
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:18,600
He looks sour.

980
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:23,960
That could just be a bad freeze frame though, you know, how like a video is what, like 30

981
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:25,240
pictures a second, you know?

982
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:26,240
Yeah.

983
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:27,600
And I still think it's kind of funny.

984
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:28,840
It is funny.

985
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:33,200
I'd like to see somebody make a comic out of that.

986
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:36,920
And what I was going to say, some of the stuff that they did show that's kind of borderline

987
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:42,400
on the hardcore games that they showed, like integration or possible integration with Forza.

988
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:45,680
And to me, that looked just kind of dumb.

989
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:49,960
I mean, okay, look, with Kinect, you can look around a car, like a virtual car and look

990
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:52,200
at different stuff on the car.

991
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:53,520
I don't care.

992
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:57,280
Or you can drive, you know, by holding your hands in the air like a steering wheel.

993
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:02,760
My arms would get tired, especially, you know, gamers out there, we're not in the best shape

994
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:05,160
and that's going to be, you know...

995
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:07,720
Didn't Joyride look like Excite Truck to you though?

996
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:08,720
No.

997
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:11,040
Joyride totally looked like Excite Truck to me.

998
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,480
I mean, I guess the colors and stuff are the same.

999
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:16,680
I heard Joyride was on rails, someone was saying.

1000
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:17,680
Was it?

1001
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:18,680
I don't know.

1002
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:19,680
I didn't play it at all.

1003
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:21,640
I looked like they were doing the tricks and jumping through rings and stuff that really

1004
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:22,680
reminded me of Excite Truck.

1005
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:25,160
And what happened to Joyride being a free game?

1006
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:26,160
Hello?

1007
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:31,040
It was supposed to be a free game on Xbox Live Arcade and then with paid download content

1008
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:35,440
and stuff, it was supposed to be a whole new different experiment and they just set aside

1009
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:37,880
and yeah, you know what, we're just going to charge $60 for it.

1010
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:39,520
That game is not worth $60.

1011
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:43,520
Maybe it'll be a pack-in game with the Kinect, because a lot of folks are speculating Kinect

1012
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:49,840
is $150 right now, which is fine, but I mean, if you have to buy a game separately, then

1013
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:53,040
aren't you really paying $210 to play a game on Kinect?

1014
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:58,400
It's the same thing if you even talk about, like, look at the bundles that they have right

1015
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:03,080
now for the PlayStation Move.

1016
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:09,860
You can get a bundle that comes with the Move controller, the camera, and a game for $130.

1017
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:14,600
And that's not including the extra controller that you need for some of the other games,

1018
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:23,120
kind of the nunchuck for the Move type thing, which you don't necessarily need, but come

1019
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:24,120
on.

1020
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:27,600
You're going to need it if you're going to want to be able to play everything out there.

1021
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:28,720
It's the same argument, both.

1022
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:29,960
It's just perception.

1023
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:33,040
You know what, I see Dark Soccer kind of looking at pictures over there, and it kind of reminds

1024
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:38,000
me, one of the games I would have liked to have seen them demo on the expo floor, I mean,

1025
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,480
I'm sorry, not the expo floor, but at the press conference as opposed to some of these,

1026
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:46,080
you know, Wii game rip-offs that they were demoing, is the Child of Eden game.

1027
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:47,080
That would have been cool.

1028
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:49,460
I've been looking at pictures from it.

1029
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:51,460
That's one thing that would have made me a little happier, is to bring out this new chip.

1030
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:52,960
See, that's more like a hardcore game.

1031
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:53,960
Yes, exactly.

1032
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:56,640
Why waste my time with Wii Sports clones?

1033
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:59,320
We all know you're going to rip off the Wii, quit wasting my time.

1034
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:01,120
That's just pretty.

1035
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:06,280
I think they should have shown the Child of Eden demo, but maybe it wasn't ready or whatever.

1036
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:10,880
I'm just absolutely, look, the fail whale made an appearance.

1037
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:13,600
I think a lot of times, though, with these demos, they're really nervous about things

1038
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:14,600
going wrong.

1039
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:16,400
Like, the things have to be exactly perfect.

1040
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:20,280
Case in point, what happened with the Zelda demonstration at Nintendo's press conference.

1041
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:22,360
They were having a lot of problems.

1042
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:24,840
And what's funny is that was the first thing, I don't mean to skip ahead, but that was the

1043
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:27,720
first thing Nintendo was showing at their press conference, and it started to make a

1044
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:34,000
lot of us go, here we go, in Nintendo's fail conference 2010, and then Reggie just kind

1045
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:38,840
of was like, you know, we'll get into that in a minute, but definitely the tone changed

1046
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:39,840
quickly.

1047
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:43,440
What did you think of yourself, fitness on the Kinect?

1048
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:44,440
I thought that was kind of neat.

1049
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:46,040
I think that's Kinect's biggest strength.

1050
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:50,360
I think that's where Kinect stands to make a lot of money right now, and if they're smart,

1051
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:55,120
they're gonna do tie-ins with the Biggest Loser TV show, and some of these exercise

1052
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:56,120
platforms.

1053
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:57,480
They do have a Biggest Loser game coming.

1054
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:00,000
I know, and who called it, here on the show?

1055
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,400
And you were like, no, they already have a Biggest Loser game.

1056
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:05,680
I'm a games analyst.

1057
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:12,440
Anyway, all joking aside, I think the exercise gaming is gonna be Kinect's biggest strength,

1058
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:14,560
and I think, is where they should go with it.

1059
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:17,760
Get off the couch, fatty, play some Kinect.

1060
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:23,480
Other things that they had, you know, out of the conference, let's see, Fable 3.

1061
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:25,960
I could care less about Fable 3.

1062
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:30,480
Basically, Fable 3 to me, you could have just shown me footage from Fable 2, it would have

1063
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:31,480
looked the same.

1064
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:34,520
I played what they had available on the show floor.

1065
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:37,720
I didn't understand what the hell was going on, because it was kind of in the middle of

1066
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:39,120
a quest already.

1067
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:41,920
I noticed that the little golden trails were still there telling you what to do, and you

1068
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:45,400
still had the dog, and then the particular quest I was doing, you got to put on a big

1069
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:49,040
chicken suit, and I guess round-up chickens, and I was amused by the fact that you were

1070
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:53,000
in a chicken suit, but yes, otherwise, I really didn't see anything that felt different to

1071
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,920
me than Fable 2.

1072
00:53:55,920 --> 00:54:00,200
But hold on, I do want to say, I mean, you make it sound like Fable 2 is a bad game though.

1073
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:04,640
I think a lot of people will be perfectly content if Fable 3 is just more Fable 2, because

1074
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:05,640
it was a great game.

1075
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:07,640
I got bored with it after a while.

1076
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:11,720
Okay, one of the coolest trailers I thought that they showed during the whole Microsoft

1077
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:17,320
press conference was for Metal Gear Solid Rising, where you can cut things pretty much

1078
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:18,960
wherever you want.

1079
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:19,960
That was awesome.

1080
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:20,960
Absolutely awesome.

1081
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:27,680
I can get behind a game like that.

1082
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:32,680
Other cool things, you know, Reach, they were talking a little bit about some of the single

1083
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:36,200
player campaign, they showed some footage from that, it looks really epic, and now they're

1084
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:39,440
going to have space dog fighting and stuff like that, that'll be pretty cool.

1085
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:44,880
You know, going to be a great game, of course.

1086
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:52,360
I don't know, other than that, I'm trying to think of what else they really showed.

1087
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:56,400
They didn't really talk too much about Xbox Live Arcade either, I don't think.

1088
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:00,080
Well there's a Summer of Arcade promo they're doing that has a lot of high profile games,

1089
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:05,120
like the Hydro Thunder I believe is a part of that, and the Hydrophobia I think is in

1090
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:08,480
there too in the Castlevania game that we talked about a little earlier.

1091
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:11,400
You know, that's back, and that's kind of where Arcade's going.

1092
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:14,940
I was personally disappointed in the lack of Game Room news, and I think just further

1093
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:18,620
cements the fact that I think Microsoft's already written it off, but I'll save that

1094
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:23,440
rant for another episode of OLR when they finally stop releasing content for Game Room.

1095
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:30,880
Yeah, I think that's about it, I want to say for, of course the new Xbox looks kind of

1096
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:35,440
sexy and stuff, you know, all the rumors are true of course, you know.

1097
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:41,240
Please America, Europe, Japan, everybody out there listening to the show, Canada, stop

1098
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:43,920
calling it the Xbox 360 slim.

1099
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:44,920
It's not slim.

1100
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:45,920
Have you seen it?

1101
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:49,040
Have you seen it next to the old Xbox 360?

1102
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:52,040
It's still fat.

1103
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:57,720
That's like saying like a guy who went from 300 pounds to 280 pounds is now skinny.

1104
00:55:57,720 --> 00:56:00,440
I mean, they're still fluffy.

1105
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:02,880
And there's not that there's anything wrong with that, not that there's anything wrong

1106
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:07,640
with the new Xbox 360, but it is not slim.

1107
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:12,600
It's just the new Xbox 360, and the relaunch of the system we all knew was going to be

1108
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:13,920
happening when Kinect came out.

1109
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:18,160
Yeah, and it's smaller, it does have a Kinect port on it that's going to provide power to

1110
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:22,160
the Kinect sensor if you want to, otherwise if you have an old system you just use the

1111
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:29,080
AC adapter, and then of course, you know, it has the integrated GPU CPU into one chip

1112
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:33,720
and the internal 250 gigabyte hard drive, which I heard was actually, you can interchange

1113
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:37,640
it like the PlayStation one, but I'm not positive.

1114
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:41,600
That's what I'm hearing too, is that it's not as hard wired in there as the old drives

1115
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:42,600
were.

1116
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:46,360
But here's the thing, I don't think those systems are for the people who already own

1117
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:47,360
Xboxes.

1118
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:53,440
It's to piss off those of us that just bought an Xbox a few months ago, thank you, and you

1119
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:56,080
know, it's a push into the holiday season.

1120
00:56:56,080 --> 00:57:01,080
And all it is, is basically just an upgrade to the current stuff that they have out there,

1121
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:04,440
and you bet your ass they're going to do another fucking price drop in the fourth quarter,

1122
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:06,840
so you might as well just wait.

1123
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:11,160
I mean, because seriously, they're going to do another price drop, I think they've already

1124
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:17,520
said that they're going to be doing something new towards the holidays, so just be patient.

1125
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:23,920
Alright, so anything else you want to say about Microsoft or Microsoft related stuff?

1126
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:24,920
Dark Sakura?

1127
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:28,320
She's going to be picking up a Kinect to shake her booty.

1128
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:29,320
That's fine.

1129
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:30,320
Alright, how about Nintendo?

1130
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:34,280
Let me give you my impression of Nintendo's press conference this year, because you know,

1131
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:37,640
Nintendo, everybody's expectations were very low for Nintendo.

1132
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:42,720
You know, everybody was expecting something more on the 3DS, but I think other than that,

1133
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:45,320
everybody kind of went in there with their expectations low, but it basically went something

1134
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:46,320
like this.

1135
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:52,520
Reggie Fils-Aime comes out on stage, hi, I'm Reggie Fils-Aime, prepare to have your minds

1136
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:53,960
fucking blown.

1137
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:58,000
Here's the new Zelda game we've been talking about for a little while, and now, here's

1138
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:03,360
a new Wii game, Kirby, here's a new Wii game, GoldenEye, who doesn't love GoldenEye?

1139
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:07,040
Here's a new Wii game, Donkey Kong Country, here's a new Wii game, I mean, he's just naming

1140
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:13,160
game after game after game after game, and then, oh, and by the way, the Wii is still

1141
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:17,600
selling well, all those reports about the people are not buying games for the Wii are

1142
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:20,440
bullshit, so don't you ever talk fucking bad about my system again.

1143
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:22,720
Here comes Iwata to tell you about the 3DS.

1144
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:27,800
That was basically what the press conference was, and then they talk about the 3DS, and

1145
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:28,800
it's real, y'all.

1146
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:34,560
I mean, having seen the thing in person now, I can tell you, it really does work.

1147
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:38,240
It's a pretty impressive piece of technology.

1148
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:43,240
Here's how I interpreted the press conference.

1149
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:46,840
The Zelda game came out, and they were showing off stuff, honestly, they should have just

1150
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:51,680
shown a trailer, because I could care less watching him try to play the damn Zelda game,

1151
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:53,720
and I do like the way it looks.

1152
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:58,480
It's kind of a cross between Wind Waker and Twilight Princess.

1153
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:05,480
I like how it's very colorful, it's got that kind of cel-shaded look to it, but it's still,

1154
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:06,480
you know...

1155
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:09,680
It looks like cel-shaded watercolor, you know?

1156
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:10,980
That's my take on it.

1157
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:16,440
It's more pastel-y, and less like toilet water filter that the last game had.

1158
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:21,560
Well, it looks like a Wii game, and not like, oh look, it's a GameCube game, or even a

1159
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:24,280
Nintendo 64 game, or something like that.

1160
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:26,600
So that's cool.

1161
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:30,200
The demonstration, though, they seriously needed to cut down that demonstration, because

1162
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:31,200
it was not exciting.

1163
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:32,200
It did go on a little long.

1164
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:33,200
It was long.

1165
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:36,120
But they know people are excited about Zelda, and that was one of the big things that everybody

1166
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:37,120
wanted to hear about.

1167
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:40,600
But, uh, sg100matt in our chatroom says, by the way, Reggie has gotten more and more chubby

1168
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:42,920
E.T.E.3, he hasn't been playing his Wii Fit.

1169
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:47,600
Dude, sg100matt, I would be careful, because Reggie will bring out some charts, and fuck

1170
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:49,600
your shit up if you decide to talk back.

1171
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:50,600
I'm sorry!

1172
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:54,880
I don't buy his, oh, people haven't, you know, been playing the Wii, you know, or people

1173
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:57,080
are playing the Wii, and all that stuff.

1174
00:59:57,080 --> 00:59:58,200
Where's your data?

1175
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:00,720
You know, you coming out here and saying this, I don't buy it.

1176
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:02,200
You cited MPD figures.

1177
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:06,760
Yeah, MPD figures, they cover what games are selling.

1178
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:11,040
And yeah, I'm sure a lot of people are buying Super Mario Galaxy and that kind of stuff,

1179
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:17,120
but every other game, like, of other genres, like say, some of the hardcore games and whatnot,

1180
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:19,400
those are not selling well.

1181
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:24,960
And you know, I can't say that the whole system's a success, but it's definitely, certain genres

1182
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:28,120
are doing well, and certain ones are not.

1183
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:32,400
It's perhaps just because they don't have all, I don't think they have the hardcore

1184
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:33,400
demographic.

1185
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:38,200
They have kind of like the families playing the game, and you know, the people that are

1186
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:44,040
big Nintendo fanboys, you know, playing just the Nintendo products, and that's about it.

1187
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:47,680
I think a lot of folks in chat are wondering, because they know I'm a hardcore Kid Icarus

1188
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:52,400
fan from back in the day, like what I was thinking when that Project Sora thing happened.

1189
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:53,600
You can pretty much imagine it.

1190
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:54,760
My jaw was on the floor.

1191
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:58,840
I was like, you know, and then as they were announcing it, I was like, oh my god, this

1192
01:00:58,840 --> 01:00:59,840
makes perfect sense.

1193
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:02,960
This is why they kept it such a big secret.

1194
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:04,540
The whole Kid Icarus thing made perfect sense.

1195
01:01:04,540 --> 01:01:08,880
And it was really the defining moment of Nintendo's press conference for me, where I was like,

1196
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:11,120
oh my god, they're back, thank you.

1197
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:15,440
Whoever hid Kami under the rafters, and whoever put the Wii Vitality sensor somewhere far,

1198
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:18,040
far away, thank you so much.

1199
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:20,400
Mario Sports is kind of dumb.

1200
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:21,400
Played it.

1201
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:24,280
It's a kid's game.

1202
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:26,360
I wasn't a huge fan of it.

1203
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:30,480
I did think Wii Party was better than a lot of people are passing it off as, though.

1204
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:35,560
But the interesting thing is, my question is, if the 3DS is not coming out this holiday

1205
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:39,360
season, which I don't know, I kind of think it's not going to.

1206
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:40,360
I think it is.

1207
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:43,940
Well, I mean, and the one good reason I'm hearing for why it is coming out this holiday

1208
01:01:43,940 --> 01:01:45,920
season, what else does Nintendo have?

1209
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:49,400
Because we know Zelda got pushed back to 2011, so what are the big releases?

1210
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:50,960
Goldeneye, that'll be a big title.

1211
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:51,960
Kirby, I think.

1212
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:53,480
Kirby, which was certainly worthy.

1213
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:57,560
Epic Mickey, so they're putting a lot of stock in a third-party title, but it's a worthy

1214
01:01:57,560 --> 01:01:58,560
title.

1215
01:01:58,560 --> 01:01:59,560
I did play a little bit of that, too.

1216
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:00,560
Looks very good.

1217
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:04,680
Wii Party, I think will be one that they really back this holiday season.

1218
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:10,720
I don't think it's for everybody, but I think it's kind of Mario Party a little more chopped

1219
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:16,680
up than just the full game for more short attention span folks.

1220
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:17,680
Kirby looked okay.

1221
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:22,440
I never really have been a big fan of Kirby, but I definitely like the style of the game.

1222
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:23,440
It's definitely unique.

1223
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:25,680
There's nothing out there like it.

1224
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:27,240
So that was kind of cool.

1225
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:31,280
Wii Party, I just kind of, my mind turned off during the whole, like, you know, Wii

1226
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:32,280
Party thing.

1227
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:33,280
I just don't care.

1228
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:34,280
It's fine.

1229
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:37,040
You play these little mini games, and what's funny is that one of them looks just like

1230
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:42,000
that rafting game they were showing in Microsoft's adventures thing, but it was funny.

1231
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:46,720
We played this boat stacking game where you had to stack people on a boat, and the size

1232
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:51,120
of the people was determined on how well you did in the mini game, and we, you know, Shane

1233
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:55,720
and I were getting competitive, and we were cracking up when all the people were falling

1234
01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:56,720
off the boat.

1235
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:58,600
You know what's funny?

1236
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:02,760
Metroid Other M just kind of had to be on the same level as all these other games.

1237
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:06,440
I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm still really excited about that game, but there was so

1238
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:10,880
much for Nintendo to show that this year Metroid wasn't able to stand out like it did last

1239
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:11,880
year.

1240
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:15,080
Metroid Other M, and it's sad, like, with the people I'm talking to, don't really seem

1241
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:19,040
to understand how awesome this game is gonna be.

1242
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:24,360
I think it looks really, really cool, so it'll be interesting to see when that comes out.

1243
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:27,500
The new Donkey Kong game, I kind of like how they're going back to the old school stuff

1244
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:29,560
with that, and see, that's the thing.

1245
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:33,400
Even with, like, new Super Mario Brothers, you don't have to reinvent the wheel.

1246
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:36,600
Just put out a good, you know, game that's in that genre.

1247
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:43,000
You don't even have to, like, go, like, all brand new with it, just, you know, a new game.

1248
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,320
I played the new GoldenEye game.

1249
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:45,320
It's a lot of fun.

1250
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:47,720
I played this odd job and kept killing Shane with my hat.

1251
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:48,720
It was a lot of fun.

1252
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:49,720
Good times.

1253
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:50,720
You threw a shoe?

1254
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:51,720
Seriously?

1255
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:52,720
Who threw a shoe?

1256
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:53,720
It was fun.

1257
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:54,720
It was fun.

1258
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:57,720
I had a good time with GoldenEye.

1259
01:03:57,720 --> 01:04:01,520
I'm trying to think what other cool stuff they were showing off.

1260
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:06,240
Epic Mickey, like, the demo that they did of that didn't, like, half of it didn't really

1261
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:07,700
impress me too much.

1262
01:04:07,700 --> 01:04:10,960
The other half, though, was pretty cool with, like, the whole Steamboat Willie, like, kind

1263
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:11,960
of.

1264
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:14,560
Yeah, that part was my favorite, too, but what really kind of impressed me about Epic

1265
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:18,580
Mickey that actually surprised me a lot is that you can kind of play Mickey a little

1266
01:04:18,580 --> 01:04:19,580
devious.

1267
01:04:19,580 --> 01:04:24,000
Like, there was a stage that we were looking at during the demo where you get sent by one

1268
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:30,980
of the characters to collect masks, and what you can do is you can go collect one mask,

1269
01:04:30,980 --> 01:04:34,500
take it to him, and he'll say, okay, now get me two more, and what you can do is you go

1270
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:39,360
around to the back of the shop, use your thinner to break down the door so you can just go

1271
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:43,000
into the back of the shop, take that same mask you just turned in, then go back to the

1272
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:47,200
front of the store and say, here's mask number two, and he'll go, hmm, I don't remember them

1273
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:50,020
coming in a set, but okay, and he'll give you credit.

1274
01:04:50,020 --> 01:04:54,160
So you can play the game as kind of like Good Mickey or Bad Mickey, which really surprised

1275
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:57,760
me that you'd be able to do that in a Mickey Mouse game.

1276
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:58,760
You know what I mean?

1277
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:01,080
It's supposed to be like...

1278
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:02,080
Now here's the thing.

1279
01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:03,080
Heart of Gold.

1280
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:06,540
Remember how they have like the concept art for Epic Mickey, and they have the really

1281
01:05:06,540 --> 01:05:09,240
twisted, creepy-ass looking characters?

1282
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:10,240
Were any of them in there?

1283
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:13,800
Because it seems to me that they really like G-rated the whole damn thing.

1284
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:18,480
It's not as like cool and epic as it was before.

1285
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:20,320
Um, yes and no.

1286
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:24,180
I think a lot of that just wasn't in the demo they were showing on the show floor, but with

1287
01:05:24,180 --> 01:05:30,140
the whole paint thinner angle, and the fact that Mickey can be deceptive, I think it could

1288
01:05:30,140 --> 01:05:31,240
be in there.

1289
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:33,200
We just didn't see it at E3.

1290
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:38,400
I wouldn't lose hope on that front yet, Loki.

1291
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:41,840
As far as Nintendo goes, I do want to talk just a minute about the 3DS, because I know

1292
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:47,240
a lot of people are really curious about what the game, or what the system kind of feels

1293
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:49,040
like.

1294
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:53,520
Don't expect things to fly out at you, like in some of those commercials.

1295
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:57,160
Imagine you're kind of like looking out this window, or looking down a hallway that has

1296
01:05:57,160 --> 01:05:59,680
depth that kind of goes in.

1297
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:01,880
That's what the 3DS kind of looks like.

1298
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:03,880
I don't know how they do the technology.

1299
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:06,520
I don't know if it's functioning on prisms is what I hear.

1300
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:11,120
No, it's basically, they've got a different layer on there that directs light to both

1301
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:12,120
your eyes.

1302
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:18,120
It's like, you know how interlaced TV works, how they have different lines that update

1303
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:19,120
every so often?

1304
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:23,800
Well imagine that, but vertical, and instead of it being updated differently, half of those

1305
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:28,360
lines are going to your right eye, half of those lines are going to your left eye.

1306
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:43,160
It's basically like, what do they call it, not lithograph, lenticular.

1307
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:47,500
Have you ever seen those boxes like for Saw, for example, the 3D one, or Final Destination

1308
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:48,500
3D.

1309
01:06:48,500 --> 01:06:51,600
That one that they had where you look at it and it looks like the stuff's kind of popping

1310
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:57,200
out because they've got basically this piece of plastic that kind of has ridges on it that

1311
01:06:57,200 --> 01:07:00,960
kind of acts like a prism and pushes it to your left eye and right eye.

1312
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:02,180
That's basically how it works.

1313
01:07:02,180 --> 01:07:05,320
They focus the image to two different eyes.

1314
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:08,280
It's like the virtual boy, but less headache inducing.

1315
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:13,640
Well let me tell you though, the best thing, I noticed the pull on my eyes, and I was kind

1316
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:17,120
of like, okay this is not going to be a healthy thing for me to play for a couple hours.

1317
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:19,080
Here's the best thing about it.

1318
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:24,320
There's a slider that you can adjust the intensity of the 3D, and if the 3D gets too gimmicky

1319
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:26,560
and too dumb for you, you just turn it off.

1320
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:28,360
Presto change-o 2D.

1321
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:31,680
One of the cool things that I did see them announce when they were talking about the

1322
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:36,920
3DS is that they're going to have support from movie studios to put out 3D movies on

1323
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:37,920
that thing.

1324
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:38,920
Yes.

1325
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:39,920
That's a cool idea.

1326
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:42,960
One of the demos they were showing was Disney's Tangled, one of the movies, I guess it's out

1327
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:43,960
in theaters.

1328
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:48,840
The trailer, and that was some of the most impressive use of 3D they had.

1329
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:53,240
I was not seeing artifacting or anything on the screen, I mean it was only the top screen,

1330
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:59,080
didn't really use the bottom screen at all, but this will be great for kids.

1331
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:00,080
Even some adults too.

1332
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:03,600
I don't think they're talking about a lot of adult movies on the 3D technology yet,

1333
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:07,320
but certainly the kids stuff, I think there's going to be a lot of people very happy.

1334
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:11,720
And of course, the developers list, which I'm not sure if we're getting into later,

1335
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:15,880
but lots of cool stuff, you know, all the big games, Mario Kart and stuff.

1336
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:19,520
Wish they had a WarioWare game, you know, right there.

1337
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:23,200
Still, I mean, if you go by the golden rule of gaming, a system is only as good as the

1338
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:24,200
games that are on it.

1339
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:26,680
This thing has the games to back it up.

1340
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:29,320
The cartridges are different from the regular DS.

1341
01:08:29,320 --> 01:08:32,680
The graphical power felt more like a Playstation 2 in there.

1342
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:34,120
I mean, not quite at that level.

1343
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:38,260
I don't think especially a lot of the rendering will be, but you know, like the Kingdom Hearts

1344
01:08:38,260 --> 01:08:41,620
little demo I saw looked like the freaking game on the PS2.

1345
01:08:41,620 --> 01:08:47,720
So you know, a lot of it is going to be pretty impressive and yeah, I mean, there's the games

1346
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:50,020
to back it up at the end of the day.

1347
01:08:50,020 --> 01:08:53,640
It doesn't, it's not like the Playstation move where I can't think of a single game

1348
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:56,800
I really want to buy the move for.

1349
01:08:56,800 --> 01:09:00,080
And Connect, I'm kind of teeter tottering, I'm like, well, I guess there's the two dance

1350
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:01,080
games.

1351
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:05,520
Connect, I'm actually planning on picking up and I actually kind of want to pick up

1352
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:10,160
like the Connect Adventures thing because I think that'd be a fun party game.

1353
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:13,120
The Dance Central stuff, I think that'd be pretty fun.

1354
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:17,120
The Fitness game, I'm not sure because, you know, I bought Wii Fit, I'm like, oh, I'm

1355
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:18,640
going to do that and stuff.

1356
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:25,640
It just, I need an excuse to work out, you know, but I don't know if I'd actually do

1357
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:26,640
that.

1358
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:29,360
It's just like, games like that make me feel like awkward, you know what I mean?

1359
01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:33,120
Where it's like you can do something, I mean, playing DDR I guess would be kind of awkward

1360
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:37,200
looking too, but I never felt awkward playing the game, you know what I mean?

1361
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:39,200
So, I don't know.

1362
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:40,200
Alright.

1363
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:46,040
Let's move on, I guess, then to Sony, if we've kind of talked enough about 3DS and so forth.

1364
01:09:46,040 --> 01:09:48,800
What did Sony do, Loki?

1365
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:54,920
Sony had, of course, their big thing was, they showed off the Move stuff and 3D.

1366
01:09:54,920 --> 01:10:01,560
3D was the big thing for them, of course they were talking about partners with third party

1367
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:03,600
companies for different 3D things.

1368
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:09,600
Now, it's a little deceptive in how they were talking about 3D, because certain games like

1369
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:18,000
Crysis 2 will not only be 3D on the Playstation platform, they will be 3D also on the Xbox

1370
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,800
360 as well.

1371
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:23,800
Not all games, though, I think were going to be 3D, but as one of their big focus, obviously

1372
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:31,080
the 3D Blu-Ray is going to be available with a firmware update, which that is pretty cool

1373
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:36,320
because if you don't have it, you would have to actually buy a whole new Blu-Ray player.

1374
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:42,600
Also, they were showing off some new games, different franchises, like Twisted Metal was

1375
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:46,800
one of the big ones that they announced, which is kind of cool, Motorstorm Apocalypse, which

1376
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:50,840
I think looks pretty fun.

1377
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:54,740
Little Big Planet 2, I got some hands on time with on the show floor, and the level we were

1378
01:10:54,740 --> 01:10:59,820
playing was a race level, but it introduced the grappling hook, and not only could you

1379
01:10:59,820 --> 01:11:04,280
grapple on certain parts of the scenery, but you could grapple the other players, and that

1380
01:11:04,280 --> 01:11:05,280
made it a lot of fun.

1381
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:06,640
We had a lot of fun with that.

1382
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:10,960
Otherwise, stylistically, it really just looks like the first game, and graphically, but

1383
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:15,960
this upgrade is really more about the extra tools that are in it than anything else, which

1384
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:16,960
I think most people do.

1385
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:20,360
I do like how you can have good control over everything, how you can make puzzle games

1386
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:27,060
and top-down action games or whatever, RPGs, that's pretty cool.

1387
01:11:27,060 --> 01:11:31,840
So it'll be interesting to see what levels are created by that, because I know I'm pretty

1388
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:37,000
creative, but I just don't have time to do it, so thankfully there's a community of millions

1389
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:41,880
of players out there to do it for me, so yeah.

1390
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:44,380
I don't know, there wasn't a lot at Sony's press conference that really made me jump

1391
01:11:44,380 --> 01:11:47,080
up and down and scream, except for Kevin Butler coming on stage.

1392
01:11:47,080 --> 01:11:48,080
That was awesome.

1393
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:50,880
I know it makes me kitty.

1394
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:52,080
What's that?

1395
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:53,440
The P word.

1396
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:54,640
The P word?

1397
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:57,720
The second of the P words.

1398
01:11:57,720 --> 01:11:58,720
You lost me.

1399
01:11:58,720 --> 01:11:59,720
Portal 2.

1400
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:05,120
Ah, Portal 2, of course, how could we forget, that was the big ending to Sony's press conference

1401
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:11,080
where Valve is basically saying, oh yeah, yeah, I guess we will make stuff for the PlayStation

1402
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:12,080
3 after all.

1403
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:15,280
That's basically what it was, like, we'll stop ignoring you.

1404
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:21,000
But I think even more so than just the fact that Portal 2 is coming out for the system,

1405
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:25,680
is more the fact that Steam is going to have some integration with the PS3.

1406
01:12:25,680 --> 01:12:29,200
That was the biggest newsworthy thing to me.

1407
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:31,000
Did you see the trailer for Portal 2?

1408
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,040
I sure did.

1409
01:12:32,040 --> 01:12:33,040
You monster.

1410
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:34,040
I know.

1411
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:39,600
But now, I've watched, and we were actually able to, you know, we've got our TV out front

1412
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:46,120
with a computer hooked up to it so we can watch YouTube videos at the high res, and

1413
01:12:46,120 --> 01:12:53,400
we watched the playthrough demonstrations, and that was really exciting.

1414
01:12:53,400 --> 01:13:02,280
But there was also an interview that G4 had up with one of the designers talking about

1415
01:13:02,280 --> 01:13:08,800
the story that, you know, you didn't escape, it's in the future, the far future, and you're

1416
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:09,800
still there.

1417
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:10,800
Oops.

1418
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:20,240
They're actually in the playtesting part for both of the storylines, but there's two stories

1419
01:13:20,240 --> 01:13:21,240
going on.

1420
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:25,000
One is strictly for single player, and the other is for cooperative play.

1421
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:28,920
So instead of cooperative being a tackline, cooperative has its own story.

1422
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:29,920
I noticed that.

1423
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:30,920
I thought that was pretty cool.

1424
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:32,160
And it makes sense for a game like Portal.

1425
01:13:32,160 --> 01:13:35,880
It would be very hard to integrate them both in the same game.

1426
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:40,080
But by the way, just in case it hasn't already been mentioned or you didn't hear, you know

1427
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:43,160
why that Portal 2 party got cancelled after all?

1428
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:45,360
It wasn't because Valve wanted to show something else out.

1429
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:48,720
They were going to announce the PlayStation thing at that party.

1430
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:55,520
But Sony came to them and said, you know, basically in so many words, um, actually,

1431
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:59,060
could you wait and come out on stage at our press conference?

1432
01:13:59,060 --> 01:14:02,760
That's why no Portal 2 event happened.

1433
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:06,440
Killzone 3 looked awesome, and I can only imagine what that looks like in 3D.

1434
01:14:06,440 --> 01:14:09,400
So that was kind of cool.

1435
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:14,640
The PlayStation Move stuff, I just couldn't get too excited about what they were showing.

1436
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:19,340
I know it's going to have support for SOCOM 4 and stuff like that, and I know that they

1437
01:14:19,340 --> 01:14:25,320
have a new Time Crisis game, which, by the way, never forget that they did come out with

1438
01:14:25,320 --> 01:14:28,200
a gun con for the Time Crisis game.

1439
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:30,920
What a waste of money that was.

1440
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:32,640
Thank you, Namco!

1441
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:36,580
Did you hear though that the Time Crisis game, there's going to be a mode that's off rails?

1442
01:14:36,580 --> 01:14:39,200
I'm like, that's not Time Crisis!

1443
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:40,200
They had that in the last one.

1444
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:41,200
Did they really?

1445
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:42,200
Yeah.

1446
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:43,200
I didn't know that.

1447
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:46,000
But see, the gun con in the last one was actually pretty cool, because they did have, you know,

1448
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:51,100
the kind of a dual grip for it, and they had, you know, one analog stick on your left hand

1449
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:54,120
where you'd be holding it in the front of the gun, and the right analog, you know, in

1450
01:14:54,120 --> 01:14:55,120
the back of the gun.

1451
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:58,720
And actually that worked really well for first-person shooters, except it was the only game that

1452
01:14:58,720 --> 01:15:00,400
used that, which is really sad.

1453
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:05,400
They didn't even really need Move, they could have done it with this thing, but whatever.

1454
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:10,300
So they've got a, you know, new Time Crisis game, and whoopty shit.

1455
01:15:10,300 --> 01:15:12,240
Where the hell did The Last Guardian go?

1456
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:15,880
That was one of the big standouts from last year, and it just kind of disappeared, didn't

1457
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:16,880
it?

1458
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:19,080
Yeah, they didn't mention anything, but it's supposed to be still coming out.

1459
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:20,800
Hmm, I found that to be a little strange.

1460
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:23,520
Maybe it was just me, but I was very disappointed.

1461
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:26,000
Still on my list for November.

1462
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,000
Interesting.

1463
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:30,320
I like how Gran Turismo 5 has a date again.

1464
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:35,040
Let's see if they actually hit that date this time.

1465
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:36,040
We'll see.

1466
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:39,160
Alright, so I guess we're done with press conferences.

1467
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:42,640
Let's kind of go around and see what everybody's- oh, you have something else you want to add?

1468
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:45,960
No, I want to talk about some of the other smaller press conferences real quick.

1469
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:46,960
Sure, sure.

1470
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:47,960
Please do.

1471
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:48,960
Just make a quick mention.

1472
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:55,660
While they didn't show the Vitality sensor, Ubisoft had their sort of Vitality sensor

1473
01:15:55,660 --> 01:15:57,240
game, I guess.

1474
01:15:57,240 --> 01:16:01,040
It wasn't really called a Vitality sensor, I forget what they were calling it, but it

1475
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:06,640
was like a breathing, relaxing game or something, which I thought was funny, because I wonder

1476
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:11,040
if that, you know, you would think that they aren't actually coming out of the Vitality

1477
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:18,720
sensor now, since that thing basically is the Vitality sensor, and that, you know, Nintendo

1478
01:16:18,720 --> 01:16:21,100
would be suing them, if that were the case.

1479
01:16:21,100 --> 01:16:22,100
So that was interesting.

1480
01:16:22,100 --> 01:16:26,760
They showed a lot of games that weren't really games, like they had a PC laser tag game,

1481
01:16:26,760 --> 01:16:29,000
but all the PC did was basically keep score.

1482
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:34,560
It was actually, you know, a real laser tag, like, pack and crap that you bought and put

1483
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:37,480
on and went and shot your friends and stuff like that.

1484
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:41,160
And Joel McHale looked really awkward hosting the Ubisoft thing.

1485
01:16:41,160 --> 01:16:42,560
The new Rayman game looks awesome.

1486
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:43,800
Have you seen that?

1487
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:45,560
The episodic one?

1488
01:16:45,560 --> 01:16:51,560
It's just- it's all really pretty hand-drawn and just really awesome.

1489
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:57,720
And then the last one that they showed, which also was kind of weird, and they were- it

1490
01:16:57,720 --> 01:17:05,400
was funny because they were saying it wasn't really a game, was Mania Planet, which, you

1491
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:09,280
know, I'm kind of a fan of the Track Mania series, but they're going to be having two

1492
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:13,360
new PC titles that are going to be able- you're going to be able to make your own custom games

1493
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:15,000
out of.

1494
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:19,320
Shoot Mania, which is going to be like a first-person shooter kind of editor, creator type thing,

1495
01:17:19,320 --> 01:17:24,440
and RPG Mania, which you'll be able to make your own RPG Mania- or your RPG type games.

1496
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:28,360
And of course, a new Track Mania game that's going to be coming out, which looks very pretty,

1497
01:17:28,360 --> 01:17:31,920
so those are pretty cool.

1498
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:33,320
That's pretty much it for right now.

1499
01:17:33,320 --> 01:17:34,320
Alright.

1500
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:35,320
Let's go around.

1501
01:17:35,320 --> 01:17:39,840
I just kind of want to get everybody's thoughts on the, you know, in your opinion, the best

1502
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:46,220
thing about E3, and the worst thing about E3, I'll start.

1503
01:17:46,220 --> 01:17:49,960
The best thing about E3 was by far the 3DS.

1504
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:55,500
I mean, just actually getting to see it and use it and behold, this new piece of technology

1505
01:17:55,500 --> 01:17:58,640
was really something else, even if the lines the first day were pretty ugly, but they got

1506
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:00,700
a little more manageable as the show went on.

1507
01:18:00,700 --> 01:18:03,080
So obviously the best thing was by far the 3DS.

1508
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:09,080
Worst thing about E3 was flaky flakes like Activision and Blizzard, you know, being under

1509
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:12,200
the same umbrella, just not even- deciding they don't even need a booth anymore.

1510
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:16,140
I realized they had their own off event, I realized they think they're at a level where

1511
01:18:16,140 --> 01:18:21,740
they can just not put up with the show of E3, but I just- I don't know, it's kind of-

1512
01:18:21,740 --> 01:18:22,740
I get-

1513
01:18:22,740 --> 01:18:23,740
Sounds tacky.

1514
01:18:23,740 --> 01:18:24,740
It's a little tacky to me.

1515
01:18:24,740 --> 01:18:28,040
I mean, they're kind of reeking of that kid who takes the ball and goes home because they

1516
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:29,240
don't like the rules of the game.

1517
01:18:29,240 --> 01:18:32,320
You know, it's just- it's unfortunate, I think.

1518
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:36,580
And just the fact that Blizzard will not show anything at E3, because basically they can

1519
01:18:36,580 --> 01:18:41,680
charge people $150 who will go see it at their own convention, and then the tickets get scalped

1520
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:47,400
on eBay, so basically people are really paying like $400 to go see these demos of games they're

1521
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:49,600
going to end up buying regardless anyway.

1522
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:54,080
Personally, I think BlizzCon is a big fat joke, but I guess I'll save that rant for

1523
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:56,720
another edition of OLR.

1524
01:18:56,720 --> 01:18:57,720
So.

1525
01:18:57,720 --> 01:19:01,000
Anyhow, best and worst of E3.

1526
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:02,000
Loki?

1527
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:07,500
I kind of have to agree with the Activision thing, just because I wish there was more

1528
01:19:07,500 --> 01:19:10,200
coverage of the Activision games.

1529
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:14,400
To me, and you were mentioning BlizzCon and stuff, a lot of the stuff that Activision

1530
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:21,880
does seems like a cash grab, and believe me, if they had thought about the whole charging

1531
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:27,400
people for online play and when you buy a used game first, they would have been doing

1532
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:28,880
it first.

1533
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:32,280
And I have a feeling they're going to be following suit with that because they can make a lot

1534
01:19:32,280 --> 01:19:35,640
of money off of those Call of Duty games, Black Ops and whatnot.

1535
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:41,660
Speaking of which, Black Ops looked fucking awesome, or no, it wasn't Black Ops, Future

1536
01:19:41,660 --> 01:19:45,360
Warrior actually, they were showing off the new Ghost Recon game, it looked awesome, and

1537
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:49,960
the Ubisoft thing, I mean, really cool.

1538
01:19:49,960 --> 01:19:54,560
One of the best moments of E3 I think was when Kevin Butler came on stage and did his

1539
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:56,360
like little rant.

1540
01:19:56,360 --> 01:19:57,900
That was actually really cool.

1541
01:19:57,900 --> 01:19:59,440
Completely scripted, well-acted rant.

1542
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:00,440
I don't care.

1543
01:20:00,440 --> 01:20:03,800
He's a great actor, he's funny, you know.

1544
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:08,320
I have no problems with, you know, I understand he's not a real, I mean, he's a real person

1545
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:11,720
but he's playing, you know, this character, and that's fine.

1546
01:20:11,720 --> 01:20:15,840
I think it's a great, you know, advertising ploy.

1547
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:16,840
So that was really cool.

1548
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:21,360
You know what's funny, I was talking to Bobby about this one of the nights, and Shane was

1549
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:24,240
probably there too, we were talking about this.

1550
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:28,240
Many years ago here on the show, well maybe a couple years ago, I kind of said one of

1551
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:31,920
the problems Sony's having right now is that they don't really have a good voice.

1552
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:37,240
Xbox 360 has Major Nelson, Nintendo has Reggie Fils-Aime, but who does Sony have?

1553
01:20:37,240 --> 01:20:41,960
Sony has not really had a spokesperson, but they sure do now, don't they?

1554
01:20:41,960 --> 01:20:43,760
My how a lot has changed in a year.

1555
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:46,760
It seems to me like the Stephen Colbert of the video game world.

1556
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:47,760
I'm sorry.

1557
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:48,760
Yes.

1558
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:51,120
I need to retract my Activision thing.

1559
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:52,960
Activision was not the worst part.

1560
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:55,720
And sadly enough it does tie in with Kevin Butler.

1561
01:20:55,720 --> 01:20:59,120
Who the fuck is this new kid pimping out the PSP stuff?

1562
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:01,800
He is so fucking annoying.

1563
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:05,680
Why would you even have someone else handling that when you have Kevin Butler?

1564
01:21:05,680 --> 01:21:10,640
It's like, hey look, we have this fine caviar, but instead we're gonna serve you dog shit

1565
01:21:10,640 --> 01:21:11,640
on a plate.

1566
01:21:11,640 --> 01:21:14,080
I mean, why would you do that?

1567
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:18,240
Why would you, you're going backwards, you took a big step backwards with this kid.

1568
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:22,760
At the end of the day, they still eat crayons, Kevin Butler or not, remember that.

1569
01:21:22,760 --> 01:21:23,800
Sony's still eating crayons.

1570
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:26,960
I understand, but seriously, what the hell?

1571
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:29,880
Rob, you gotta admit, the kid wears the bicycle helmet.

1572
01:21:29,880 --> 01:21:33,440
And then they played like two commercials with him in it, and I'm like, stop.

1573
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:36,080
I already hate him already.

1574
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:37,080
And that's to be redundant.

1575
01:21:37,080 --> 01:21:38,080
SSJ100MattInOurChat.

1576
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:39,080
That's terrible.

1577
01:21:39,080 --> 01:21:40,080
Exactly right.

1578
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:41,080
Chat.

1579
01:21:41,080 --> 01:21:45,480
ThatOrangeLawnTrader.com says, seriously, think of the games they could have shown instead

1580
01:21:45,480 --> 01:21:50,200
of Kevin Butler's rant, but it was an epic time killing moment.

1581
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:53,440
ToaGak believes that dog shit is actually better than caviar.

1582
01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:56,020
All right, fine.

1583
01:21:56,020 --> 01:22:00,860
We can serve you filet mignon, wrapped in bacon, the most delicious food you could possibly

1584
01:22:00,860 --> 01:22:04,240
ever have, or a steaming pile of dog shit.

1585
01:22:04,240 --> 01:22:11,040
In fact, we'll just put the dog over your face and he can shit straight into your mouth.

1586
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:13,200
So it's absolutely fresh.

1587
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:15,240
Loki, we get it.

1588
01:22:15,240 --> 01:22:16,240
God.

1589
01:22:16,240 --> 01:22:18,160
I don't think you do.

1590
01:22:18,160 --> 01:22:20,920
Well, I'm done with that.

1591
01:22:20,920 --> 01:22:23,240
This dog has been constipated forever.

1592
01:22:23,240 --> 01:22:26,960
Don't make me bring out the Dalek.

1593
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:28,080
Dark Sakura, please.

1594
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:31,600
The best thing about E3 for you and the worst thing about E3 for you.

1595
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:38,000
It's a combination of getting my little bit of Portal 2 crack, because you know I've been

1596
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,680
waiting for that.

1597
01:22:39,680 --> 01:22:43,600
And did they say anything about Half-Life 3?

1598
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:48,400
That's what I wanted to ask.

1599
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:49,400
You're funny.

1600
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:51,580
Valve, acknowledging Half-Life.

1601
01:22:51,580 --> 01:22:52,580
That's funny.

1602
01:22:52,580 --> 01:22:54,680
No, they didn't.

1603
01:22:54,680 --> 01:23:02,040
Anyway, and the other good thing would be Kid Icarus with the 3DS.

1604
01:23:02,040 --> 01:23:03,420
So yay.

1605
01:23:03,420 --> 01:23:07,520
And the worst thing is there was no me there.

1606
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:08,520
That was pretty awful.

1607
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:09,520
I'm sorry.

1608
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:12,720
So I couldn't have my Epic running into Kojima, but he wasn't there anyway.

1609
01:23:12,720 --> 01:23:15,000
That's why you couldn't go.

1610
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:21,160
It's a constant in the universe that every E3 that I go to, I have to run into Kojima.

1611
01:23:21,160 --> 01:23:23,120
Literally.

1612
01:23:23,120 --> 01:23:24,840
And you know what else is kind of dumb?

1613
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:27,120
Not quite the worst thing of E3.

1614
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:28,680
What are they doing with the PSP?

1615
01:23:28,680 --> 01:23:31,120
Ooh, look, we have a new God of War game.

1616
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:32,120
Props to you.

1617
01:23:32,120 --> 01:23:33,120
New God of War game.

1618
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:34,120
Awesome.

1619
01:23:34,120 --> 01:23:37,440
They're still trying to kind of recover from that whole PSP Go debacle.

1620
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:40,640
I think Sony's gonna save that PSP 2 for next year.

1621
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:43,400
Guaranteed there'll be a PSP 2 next year.

1622
01:23:43,400 --> 01:23:44,400
They're gonna have to.

1623
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:45,400
All right.

1624
01:23:45,400 --> 01:23:47,280
They can't lose by much more.

1625
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:51,680
How about some release dates, because meanwhile while expos are going on, there's still games

1626
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:56,800
coming to a store near you, and we probably should acknowledge some of the upcoming releases.

1627
01:23:56,800 --> 01:24:02,320
Yes, this week there's gonna be some Transformers.

1628
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:11,340
The Cybertron Wars will be coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, the Wii, and of course two versions

1629
01:24:11,340 --> 01:24:17,760
on the DS, because they have to have one for every faction, and one on the PSP, one on

1630
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:19,760
the PC.

1631
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:23,080
Way too many Transformers, but that's fine.

1632
01:24:23,080 --> 01:24:27,320
Also this week, crappy DS games, including Western Riding Academy.

1633
01:24:27,320 --> 01:24:31,360
Awesome, because there's no horse riding games on the DS at all.

1634
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:37,400
TNA Cross the Line, that's gonna be coming out on PSP and DS this week.

1635
01:24:37,400 --> 01:24:43,320
DS Sing, it's a karaoke game for the DS that comes with a microphone that plugs into your

1636
01:24:43,320 --> 01:24:47,040
DS, so you can look like a tool on the subway.

1637
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:52,480
Ten Minute Solutions, coming from Activision, it's their fitness game based off a DVD exercise

1638
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:53,480
series.

1639
01:24:53,480 --> 01:24:59,760
Wipeout, based off the, I guess it's a popular TV show on DS and Wii.

1640
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:00,760
Thank you Activision.

1641
01:25:00,760 --> 01:25:06,840
Why can't they just have Takashi's Castle the game?

1642
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:13,240
I mean, I know they did way back in the day, but a new one, that would be kind of cool.

1643
01:25:13,240 --> 01:25:16,440
Ah, the Wii, what junk you have.

1644
01:25:16,440 --> 01:25:22,880
Calvin Tucker's Redneck Racing on the Wii, from Zoo Games, thank you very much.

1645
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:30,640
And some generic brain training games, Think Smart on DS, and then they also have Think

1646
01:25:30,640 --> 01:25:37,880
Smart Kids on DS, and then that's also on the Wii.

1647
01:25:37,880 --> 01:25:44,480
Let's see here, a couple more, Field and Stream, Total Outdoorsman Challenge on the Xbox 360,

1648
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:49,320
Puzzle Quest 2 on the DS, and that's gonna be the old school Puzzle Quest game, none

1649
01:25:49,320 --> 01:25:54,600
of this crappy hexagon space Puzzle Quest crap.

1650
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:57,200
Play that at the show, it has a lot of new mini games too.

1651
01:25:57,200 --> 01:25:58,200
Yes.

1652
01:25:58,200 --> 01:26:02,400
And finally, an actual game from Nintendo, and kind of a cult classic, or soon to be

1653
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:06,200
a cult classic, Sin and Punishment Star Successor, coming out this week.

1654
01:26:06,200 --> 01:26:08,440
Get it now, until it's gone, before it's gone.

1655
01:26:08,440 --> 01:26:09,440
Yeah.

1656
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:10,440
So, that's it.

1657
01:26:10,440 --> 01:26:13,480
If you want Nintendo to put out more titles like that, you might want to get it now.

1658
01:26:13,480 --> 01:26:17,400
Although it does look like, I mean Nintendo's got a lot of, I guess you could say hardcore,

1659
01:26:17,400 --> 01:26:20,320
quote unquote, games coming out for the rest of the year.

1660
01:26:20,320 --> 01:26:23,560
Okay, some of the other games coming out in Japan.

1661
01:26:23,560 --> 01:26:26,880
Big Week in Japan with this release, because I think this is definitely one we want to

1662
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:29,800
keep an eye on, because this looks like a pretty awesome game.

1663
01:26:29,800 --> 01:26:35,200
Monster Hunter Frontier Online is coming out from Capcom in Japan on the Xbox 360 this

1664
01:26:35,200 --> 01:26:37,360
week, so yes it is an online adventure.

1665
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:41,120
I would probably stop short of saying MMO, but you're gonna have 11 different types

1666
01:26:41,120 --> 01:26:46,520
of weapons, and you'll be able to use the Xbox 360 live, basically, to go into a plaza,

1667
01:26:46,520 --> 01:26:48,360
chat with other hunters for tips.

1668
01:26:48,360 --> 01:26:52,360
Capcom's gonna be regularly updating the game, so keep an eye on that one.

1669
01:26:52,360 --> 01:26:55,940
I bet if anybody's importing a game, that would be one of them.

1670
01:26:55,940 --> 01:27:00,240
Sengoku Hime 2 is also coming out this week from SystemSoft, a little strategy game there

1671
01:27:00,240 --> 01:27:05,440
featuring anime characters, that's a lot of the games in Japan end up being.

1672
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:09,640
There's also, by the way, a special new keyboard coming out for the Xbox 360 Monster Hunter

1673
01:27:09,640 --> 01:27:12,680
game, so keep a look out for that.

1674
01:27:12,680 --> 01:27:16,160
In other Japanese release dates, there are some games coming out on the Playstation 3

1675
01:27:16,160 --> 01:27:17,160
as well.

1676
01:27:17,160 --> 01:27:23,260
There's a game called White Album, Susarariu Fuyu no Omoide is coming out, and this is

1677
01:27:23,260 --> 01:27:25,640
an adventure game.

1678
01:27:25,640 --> 01:27:29,520
Basically your idol is your girlfriend, and the more popular she becomes, the less time

1679
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:31,720
she has for you.

1680
01:27:31,720 --> 01:27:36,560
That's basically the plot of the game, conflicts, fight with your girlfriend, the game is basically

1681
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:37,560
what this is.

1682
01:27:37,560 --> 01:27:38,560
So...

1683
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:39,560
Why would I buy a game?

1684
01:27:39,560 --> 01:27:43,120
It's funny, if you buy a game like that, you might actually start the real life version

1685
01:27:43,120 --> 01:27:45,800
of the game.

1686
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:52,000
Also a game coming out over there, Tottori no Atelier, Arland no Reckon Jushuchi 2 comes

1687
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:53,000
out.

1688
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:58,760
It's a sequel to Rona no Atelier, it takes place 10 years after that, it's an RPG.

1689
01:27:58,760 --> 01:28:02,760
You have, you know, synthesis and go on swashbuckling adventures, etc. etc.

1690
01:28:02,760 --> 01:28:06,440
It's a JRPG, in its finest.

1691
01:28:06,440 --> 01:28:12,480
Going over to the Nintendo Wii, SD Gundam Gashapon Wars comes out this week.

1692
01:28:12,480 --> 01:28:14,960
Aw, I love SD Gundam, they're so cute.

1693
01:28:14,960 --> 01:28:18,640
There's also a version coming out with a classic controller, it should be stated, so check

1694
01:28:18,640 --> 01:28:19,640
that out.

1695
01:28:19,640 --> 01:28:22,640
By the way, Goldeneye, I played completely on a classic controller, that's how they were

1696
01:28:22,640 --> 01:28:23,640
demoing it.

1697
01:28:23,640 --> 01:28:26,560
I meant to get that out at some point.

1698
01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:30,740
You don't have to use motion control at all in Goldeneye, the way it should be.

1699
01:28:30,740 --> 01:28:35,640
On the Nintendo DS this week in Japan, Love Plus comes out this week, and there's like

1700
01:28:35,640 --> 01:28:40,440
all these little play stands and things coming out to support it, but that's what it's called,

1701
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:43,520
it's called Love Plus.

1702
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:49,480
It's like a experienced school, and you go on vacations and mountain climbing with three

1703
01:28:49,480 --> 01:28:52,720
girls and you date, it's another dating sim, okay guys?

1704
01:28:52,720 --> 01:28:57,680
It's the one that's, you know, it's basically a sequel to the one that was like, you know,

1705
01:28:57,680 --> 01:28:59,880
where the guy married the character in a bagel.

1706
01:28:59,880 --> 01:29:01,680
Yes, it is, it is that same series.

1707
01:29:01,680 --> 01:29:07,560
Also, if that's not enough for you, Tokimeki Memorial Girls' Side, third story, so if Love

1708
01:29:07,560 --> 01:29:13,240
Plus is not for you, maybe you want to play the girls' side.

1709
01:29:13,240 --> 01:29:16,520
It's basically where you are now the female lead and you're trying to get a boyfriend

1710
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:18,280
before graduation.

1711
01:29:18,280 --> 01:29:20,660
So I like that, that they're both coming out the same week.

1712
01:29:20,660 --> 01:29:24,680
You know, Rob, I have a laserdisc of Tokimeki Memorial OAV.

1713
01:29:24,680 --> 01:29:25,680
Really?

1714
01:29:25,680 --> 01:29:29,960
Yeah, and I bought it because it had a big Konami logo on it.

1715
01:29:29,960 --> 01:29:31,520
Fun.

1716
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:34,480
That really pretty much does it for release dates.

1717
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:36,320
I'm looking at the Sony PSP.

1718
01:29:36,320 --> 01:29:41,320
I guess I should say Hatsune Miku Project Diva is coming out this week.

1719
01:29:41,320 --> 01:29:43,080
I think this has been covered on a previous show.

1720
01:29:43,080 --> 01:29:44,080
It is a rhythm game.

1721
01:29:44,080 --> 01:29:47,600
There's a number of people in the chatroom who have been all kinds of hyper about getting

1722
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:48,600
it too.

1723
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:49,600
Yeah, so...

1724
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:50,600
It's the Vocaloid.

1725
01:29:50,600 --> 01:29:53,200
It's the Sega rhythm game, so I bet there's some people...

1726
01:29:53,200 --> 01:29:54,200
But you...

1727
01:29:54,200 --> 01:29:55,200
Oh, you know what it is?

1728
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:56,200
I'm sorry.

1729
01:29:56,200 --> 01:29:57,200
It's a price reduction.

1730
01:29:57,200 --> 01:29:58,200
It's not the initial release.

1731
01:29:58,200 --> 01:30:00,720
But you know who Hatsune Miku is?

1732
01:30:00,720 --> 01:30:01,720
The Vocaloid.

1733
01:30:01,720 --> 01:30:07,320
You know, remember sending you all those videos of the electronic girl voice singing?

1734
01:30:07,320 --> 01:30:08,320
Yeah, I do.

1735
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:09,320
That's her.

1736
01:30:09,320 --> 01:30:13,840
Chaos Head Noah is the last game I'm going to mention this week, also on the PSP.

1737
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:17,400
That's an adventure game that's coming out there on the PSP in Japan.

1738
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:20,120
All right, DarkSakura, how about the Old Kingdom?

1739
01:30:20,120 --> 01:30:24,240
Well, um, eh.

1740
01:30:24,240 --> 01:30:25,240
That's my official answer.

1741
01:30:25,240 --> 01:30:27,480
No, um, we've got a number of things.

1742
01:30:27,480 --> 01:30:32,640
On the 23rd, we have Land Bandit and Puzzle Quest 2.

1743
01:30:32,640 --> 01:30:34,960
Excuse me.

1744
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:43,040
And on the 25th, we have Armada 2526, Backbreaker, Demon's Souls, Lego Harry Potter Years 1-4,

1745
01:30:43,040 --> 01:30:47,560
Naughty Bear, that just sounds like a bedroom nickname.

1746
01:30:47,560 --> 01:30:50,320
Someone's been a naughty bear.

1747
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:57,320
Singularity, Transformers War for Cybertron, and that is it for this week.

1748
01:30:57,320 --> 01:30:58,320
All right.

1749
01:30:58,320 --> 01:31:03,080
That's going to do it for release dates for right now.

1750
01:31:03,080 --> 01:31:04,080
What's that?

1751
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:05,080
Are you a naughty bear?

1752
01:31:05,080 --> 01:31:06,080
I'm a very naughty bear.

1753
01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:10,520
YYR in our chatroom, I love this, talking about Love Plus, although AlphaKananagram is

1754
01:31:10,520 --> 01:31:11,520
saying it's Love Plus Plus.

1755
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:13,520
Hey, I just read it like it was written, okay?

1756
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:17,320
YYR says, uh, I'll be waiting for the depressing sequel, Love Minus.

1757
01:31:17,320 --> 01:31:20,200
It takes place after all the girls dump the main character's sorry ass.

1758
01:31:20,200 --> 01:31:22,760
There you go, that's the real game right there.

1759
01:31:22,760 --> 01:31:27,040
Chat.orangeacollegenity.com if you want to join in the fun.

1760
01:31:27,040 --> 01:31:28,600
It's such a weird game.

1761
01:31:28,600 --> 01:31:29,600
Yeah.

1762
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:32,560
Uh, at least you don't poke witches in it.

1763
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:42,400
Um, so E3 of course was pretty big, and there was 45,600 attendees, and next year you can

1764
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:46,000
expect E3 to be coming out slightly earlier.

1765
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:50,360
June 7th through the 9th, it will be also at the LA Convention Center, and of course

1766
01:31:50,360 --> 01:31:54,160
they're expecting probably an even bigger turnout for that as well.

1767
01:31:54,160 --> 01:31:55,160
So.

1768
01:31:55,160 --> 01:31:56,160
Alrighty.

1769
01:31:56,160 --> 01:32:00,520
300 exhibitors this year as well.

1770
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:02,840
You know what though, the show's starting to get a little big.

1771
01:32:02,840 --> 01:32:08,740
Like I, that was oddly worded the way I said, but I mean, I don't want it to get as big

1772
01:32:08,740 --> 01:32:12,880
as it was in 2006, especially when Kensha Hall is now a parking lot, which is what they

1773
01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:14,880
use Kensha Hall for now, by the way, just so you know.

1774
01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:15,880
It's a parking lot?

1775
01:32:15,880 --> 01:32:18,160
Yes, it's a parking lot, people park their cars in there.

1776
01:32:18,160 --> 01:32:19,160
In the hall?

1777
01:32:19,160 --> 01:32:20,160
In the hall.

1778
01:32:20,160 --> 01:32:21,160
When did that get dirty?

1779
01:32:21,160 --> 01:32:23,720
Uh, I think the floor is probably removable.

1780
01:32:23,720 --> 01:32:26,920
They can do that now.

1781
01:32:26,920 --> 01:32:29,960
I'm not kidding, when I went down there to use the bathroom at one point, I looked in

1782
01:32:29,960 --> 01:32:31,400
the doors, there's all these cars parked in there.

1783
01:32:31,400 --> 01:32:35,240
I don't know if it was the exhibitors or what, but that's what they use Kensha Hall for now.

1784
01:32:35,240 --> 01:32:36,240
Weird.

1785
01:32:36,240 --> 01:32:40,560
Well, you know what, this is a good story for us to kind of sort of end on here on this

1786
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:45,160
part A, and that is that, you know, the news doesn't stop just because E3 is over, and

1787
01:32:45,160 --> 01:32:51,200
apparently Hideo Kojima is, and they were saying he was at E3 this week, showing off

1788
01:32:51,200 --> 01:32:52,680
Metal Gear Solid Rising.

1789
01:32:52,680 --> 01:32:53,680
But.

1790
01:32:53,680 --> 01:32:54,920
He was at the press conference.

1791
01:32:54,920 --> 01:32:55,920
Yeah.

1792
01:32:55,920 --> 01:33:02,200
Apparently, he is sitting on a massive PS3 exclusive that was not ready to show at E3.

1793
01:33:02,200 --> 01:33:04,920
They're going to show it at Tokyo Game Show.

1794
01:33:04,920 --> 01:33:07,260
So don't forget, the news does not end at E3.

1795
01:33:07,260 --> 01:33:11,040
There are still other expos that people are going to show their big news.

1796
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:16,120
This is coming from a CVG, computer and video game source, that apparently there is a PlayStation

1797
01:33:16,120 --> 01:33:20,820
3 exclusive that is supposed to, quote, own the show in Tokyo.

1798
01:33:20,820 --> 01:33:25,700
They really wanted to have it ready for E3, but it unfortunately just was not ready.

1799
01:33:25,700 --> 01:33:29,280
And maybe they didn't want to steal the thunder from Metal Gear Solid Rising anyway.

1800
01:33:29,280 --> 01:33:31,120
No idea what it could be.

1801
01:33:31,120 --> 01:33:34,720
Could it be an existing Kojima series like Boktai?

1802
01:33:34,720 --> 01:33:35,720
Probably not.

1803
01:33:35,720 --> 01:33:36,720
Zone of the Enders?

1804
01:33:36,720 --> 01:33:37,720
I somehow doubt that too.

1805
01:33:37,720 --> 01:33:38,720
Yeah.

1806
01:33:38,720 --> 01:33:41,480
I think this is probably going to be a whole new thing.

1807
01:33:41,480 --> 01:33:43,720
Or maybe another just Metal Gear Solid game.

1808
01:33:43,720 --> 01:33:44,720
Nah.

1809
01:33:44,720 --> 01:33:45,720
Probably not that.

1810
01:33:45,720 --> 01:33:46,720
I think it'll be an all new Kojima game.

1811
01:33:46,720 --> 01:33:47,720
But we'll see.

1812
01:33:47,720 --> 01:33:50,600
Metal Gear Solid move party.

1813
01:33:50,600 --> 01:33:53,640
Snake party!

1814
01:33:53,640 --> 01:33:54,640
Oh wait.

1815
01:33:54,640 --> 01:33:55,640
That sounds bad.

1816
01:33:55,640 --> 01:33:59,840
Alright, well we can't end part A here at Orange Lounge Radio without doing a segment

1817
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:02,240
we love here at Orange Lounge Radio.

1818
01:34:02,240 --> 01:34:03,800
The classic game of the week.

1819
01:34:03,800 --> 01:34:07,960
It's a chance for Dark Sakura to go in the gaming vault and say, hey!

1820
01:34:07,960 --> 01:34:11,880
I know you people have been playing all these newfangled games and been re-nup on these

1821
01:34:11,880 --> 01:34:17,240
3D systems, these Microsoft flails and all this stuff, but you know what?

1822
01:34:17,240 --> 01:34:19,440
Don't forget your roots, kids.

1823
01:34:19,440 --> 01:34:23,040
Here's a classic video game you bitches should be playing, right Dark Sakura?

1824
01:34:23,040 --> 01:34:24,040
Yes.

1825
01:34:24,040 --> 01:34:26,640
This is a game that I love.

1826
01:34:26,640 --> 01:34:30,120
Alright, what is the classic video game of the week, Dark Sakura?

1827
01:34:30,120 --> 01:34:38,560
This is a game that was for the PC Engine Super CD called Silphia.

1828
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:40,040
Silphia?

1829
01:34:40,040 --> 01:34:46,960
Yeah, and I had to go to different sources to find more information about it because

1830
01:34:46,960 --> 01:34:51,640
I haven't played the game for a little while myself, but it's a fun little shooter.

1831
01:34:51,640 --> 01:34:55,920
It's a 2D shooter set in mythological Greece.

1832
01:34:55,920 --> 01:35:02,440
You have a ton of extra lives and you get a special attack called the Giga Fairy Beam.

1833
01:35:02,440 --> 01:35:03,440
Fairy Beam?

1834
01:35:03,440 --> 01:35:06,240
Yes, because you play as a fairy.

1835
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:08,560
You're a fairy.

1836
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:14,520
It's not really one of the greatest games because it's really not super challenging,

1837
01:35:14,520 --> 01:35:19,640
but it's just really, really nice.

1838
01:35:19,640 --> 01:35:32,400
You start off with this woman warrior who dies protecting Athena's temple and so she

1839
01:35:32,400 --> 01:35:48,360
turns into a Silphia so she can go and basically stop all the people who tried to hurt all

1840
01:35:48,360 --> 01:35:50,640
of them, so it's sort of the main story.

1841
01:35:50,640 --> 01:35:55,520
Anyway, you fly around and you get power-ups.

1842
01:35:55,520 --> 01:36:04,440
Your power-ups are bee icons and you have different bosses you fight.

1843
01:36:04,440 --> 01:36:11,840
One's a colossus and one is, I believe, that you fight a gorgon in one level too.

1844
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:19,600
Like that one, you're fighting this big demon thing that takes off his head, I think.

1845
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:25,360
It really goes for things from different Greek mythology.

1846
01:36:25,360 --> 01:36:29,920
You have a flying chariot that's pulled by manticores.

1847
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:35,120
It's pretty fun, pretty flight of fancy sort of game.

1848
01:36:35,120 --> 01:36:39,160
It is put out by Compile and Compile has brought out a lot of good games.

1849
01:36:39,160 --> 01:36:41,680
There's your reason right there to play it, honestly.

1850
01:36:41,680 --> 01:36:48,520
That's the people who did the Guardian Legend, need I say more.

1851
01:36:48,520 --> 01:36:51,640
It's pricey to try to find a copy of it now.

1852
01:36:51,640 --> 01:36:53,080
It really is.

1853
01:36:53,080 --> 01:36:56,680
I have a copy.

1854
01:36:56,680 --> 01:37:02,280
It goes for about $100 average on eBay, but it's a really good game, really fun.

1855
01:37:02,280 --> 01:37:06,600
I would say, for those of you out there who've got Magic Engine, get a disc image of it and

1856
01:37:06,600 --> 01:37:10,040
give it a go and then fork out $100, see if you like it.

1857
01:37:10,040 --> 01:37:13,560
You know what this reminds me of a little bit is Legendary Wings, just in looking at

1858
01:37:13,560 --> 01:37:16,440
it, kind of, but cute.

1859
01:37:16,440 --> 01:37:19,600
This robo monster she's fighting right now has ginormous tits.

1860
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:20,600
Yeah.

1861
01:37:20,600 --> 01:37:21,600
Look at that.

1862
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:22,600
Since I have a golem, I think.

1863
01:37:22,600 --> 01:37:27,480
Give me a little bra, perverts, but too bad about that Medusa head.

1864
01:37:27,480 --> 01:37:28,480
Yeah.

1865
01:37:28,480 --> 01:37:30,640
All right, there it is.

1866
01:37:30,640 --> 01:37:35,200
That's the one thing I also wanted to point out too, is that your attack can go directional

1867
01:37:35,200 --> 01:37:37,560
based on proximity.

1868
01:37:37,560 --> 01:37:38,560
Very cool.

1869
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:44,360
It is, it makes fighting the bosses a little bit more dynamic than your average 2D shooter.

1870
01:37:44,360 --> 01:37:50,800
Your classic game of the week for the PC Engine, a compile classic, Sylvia is the classic game

1871
01:37:50,800 --> 01:37:51,800
of the week.

1872
01:37:51,800 --> 01:37:56,480
A game so crazy rare, Dark Sakura had to really scour the web to find more information on

1873
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:57,480
it.

1874
01:37:57,480 --> 01:38:00,100
All right, that's going to do it for your classic video game of the week.

1875
01:38:00,100 --> 01:38:02,280
We have plenty more to come here at Orange Lounge Radio.

1876
01:38:02,280 --> 01:38:05,360
You know, there's a lot of news that still kind of happened that was little things that

1877
01:38:05,360 --> 01:38:09,000
happened at E3, and we're going to talk all about that when we come back in Part B. Also,

1878
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:12,560
I need to talk about the big battle, because I didn't mention that in Part A, because E3

1879
01:38:12,560 --> 01:38:14,860
was going on, but I want to mention a little bit more about that.

1880
01:38:14,860 --> 01:38:16,080
We got the mailbag.

1881
01:38:16,080 --> 01:38:20,480
We got the Twitter topics, and all that other fun stuff coming right back at you when we

1882
01:38:20,480 --> 01:38:30,080
come right back here on more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1883
01:38:30,080 --> 01:38:32,800
And welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

1884
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:39,400
We are live with our 371st episode on this June the 20th of 2010, where we are taping

1885
01:38:39,400 --> 01:38:45,040
live, of course, as we do every Sunday night at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.

1886
01:38:45,040 --> 01:38:49,640
Speaking of All Games, amongst all the E3 madness, I nearly neglected to mention this,

1887
01:38:49,640 --> 01:38:53,040
and I definitely wanted to mention this at some point tonight, but this has been kind

1888
01:38:53,040 --> 01:38:57,680
of building for a couple weeks here, and that is the Big Battle, which is a competition

1889
01:38:57,680 --> 01:39:00,920
between several of the shows on the All Games Network.

1890
01:39:00,920 --> 01:39:02,240
It is not the host.

1891
01:39:02,240 --> 01:39:05,360
It's the listeners that actually are going to be doing some of the competing in these

1892
01:39:05,360 --> 01:39:06,360
games.

1893
01:39:06,360 --> 01:39:09,200
And there's still more games to be announced.

1894
01:39:09,200 --> 01:39:14,440
Think of it as like a gaming Olympics, and you can get all the information at thebigbattle.net.

1895
01:39:14,440 --> 01:39:16,920
I think also bigbattle.allgames.com works.

1896
01:39:16,920 --> 01:39:19,520
It really doesn't matter which one you use, but definitely check out that site.

1897
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:23,720
I'm going to go ahead and copy paste that link into our chat room right now at chat

1898
01:39:23,720 --> 01:39:28,480
room.orangeloungeradio.com, so you can sign up to represent OLR, because we're only the

1899
01:39:28,480 --> 01:39:30,680
second largest team on there right now.

1900
01:39:30,680 --> 01:39:34,680
And I don't think we can really rest until we're the largest team being represented in

1901
01:39:34,680 --> 01:39:35,680
the Big Battle.

1902
01:39:35,680 --> 01:39:38,160
But then we actually have to win some of the competitions, too.

1903
01:39:38,160 --> 01:39:44,520
And really wrapping up soon, Battlefield Bad Company 2 and Soldner X2.

1904
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:46,440
Both of those battles wrapping up very soon.

1905
01:39:46,440 --> 01:39:51,080
I believe there's going to be a live Battlefield competition on the 26th, and then Soldner

1906
01:39:51,080 --> 01:39:55,440
X2 is basically get the highest score you can in the next week.

1907
01:39:55,440 --> 01:39:59,040
But I will say some new competitions were added, because we got a lot of Twitter feedback

1908
01:39:59,040 --> 01:40:02,920
when we first announced the Big Battle, like, well, where are the games that I own?

1909
01:40:02,920 --> 01:40:03,920
I don't own those games.

1910
01:40:03,920 --> 01:40:05,520
Well, remember, guys, it's like the Olympics.

1911
01:40:05,520 --> 01:40:09,040
There's going to be more and more games that are added as this event goes on.

1912
01:40:09,040 --> 01:40:13,480
And some of the new games that were added, Pinball, that's right, Zen Pinball and Pinball

1913
01:40:13,480 --> 01:40:14,480
FX.

1914
01:40:14,480 --> 01:40:18,680
So you can play the Earth Defense Force table for a high score in Zen Pinball, or you can

1915
01:40:18,680 --> 01:40:22,120
play Pinball FX, the Buccier table on the 360.

1916
01:40:22,120 --> 01:40:25,960
Both those events end on July 9th, and more information is available on thebigbattle.net.

1917
01:40:25,960 --> 01:40:27,680
And it's just high score.

1918
01:40:27,680 --> 01:40:31,420
And if we get the highest score, then our team gets, like, 10 points, and that's great.

1919
01:40:31,420 --> 01:40:35,040
So everybody should sign up and just get the highest score you can.

1920
01:40:35,040 --> 01:40:38,800
And we're going to show all these other all-game shows that were much more than just the music

1921
01:40:38,800 --> 01:40:42,640
games and all that fun stuff, that we can bring it to the table on some of these other

1922
01:40:42,640 --> 01:40:43,640
games too.

1923
01:40:43,640 --> 01:40:44,640
So it'll be fun.

1924
01:40:44,640 --> 01:40:45,640
So check that out again.

1925
01:40:45,640 --> 01:40:51,440
One more time, thebigbattle.net, and we'll bring you the results for Soldner X2 and Battlefield

1926
01:40:51,440 --> 01:40:53,760
Bad Company 2, hopefully for next week's show.

1927
01:40:53,760 --> 01:40:58,800
Hopefully the folks behind the all-games radio Big Battle will be able to get those results

1928
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:01,800
to me soon.

1929
01:41:01,800 --> 01:41:06,440
Moving on with show stuff, we're going to do some rapid-fire news here in Part B and

1930
01:41:06,440 --> 01:41:07,800
then get to the Twitter topics.

1931
01:41:07,800 --> 01:41:11,640
So if you still need to get your Twitter topics in, you have just a few more minutes.

1932
01:41:11,640 --> 01:41:15,640
Alright, Loki, why don't you start us off with some of the stuff that may be a missed

1933
01:41:15,640 --> 01:41:21,720
at E3 amongst all these 3DSs and Valve on PlayStation and all this other stuff that

1934
01:41:21,720 --> 01:41:23,080
was going on.

1935
01:41:23,080 --> 01:41:24,080
This is kind of neat.

1936
01:41:24,080 --> 01:41:28,920
Secret of Mana is coming to the iPhone later this year.

1937
01:41:28,920 --> 01:41:32,160
Basically going to be a port of the SNES game.

1938
01:41:32,160 --> 01:41:37,380
And they didn't really say when exactly it's going to be ported over, but sometime in 2010.

1939
01:41:37,380 --> 01:41:41,080
So keep on looking out for that one.

1940
01:41:41,080 --> 01:41:44,400
Also, by the way, just because I noticed it's not mentioned here, Final Fantasy Tactics

1941
01:41:44,400 --> 01:41:47,020
is also in that same boat.

1942
01:41:47,020 --> 01:41:48,480
Very cool.

1943
01:41:48,480 --> 01:41:52,480
Another game coming to the iPhone is Bit.Trip Beat.

1944
01:41:52,480 --> 01:41:55,800
That's going to be coming out as well.

1945
01:41:55,800 --> 01:42:00,760
No word on exactly when that is, but it is coming out soon.

1946
01:42:00,760 --> 01:42:01,760
So that's kind of cool.

1947
01:42:01,760 --> 01:42:10,440
They're going to use, I guess, the tilt controls to move the paddle in just like the Wii version.

1948
01:42:10,440 --> 01:42:17,680
Scott Pilgrim vs. The World is getting kind of an arcade game.

1949
01:42:17,680 --> 01:42:24,360
It's going to be exclusive on the PlayStation Network for a certain period of time.

1950
01:42:24,360 --> 01:42:26,960
It will be coming out August 10th.

1951
01:42:26,960 --> 01:42:34,960
And of course, this game looks absolutely amazing and really I don't understand why

1952
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:41,040
people before when I was posting that we should do, what was it, remember we had that list

1953
01:42:41,040 --> 01:42:45,080
list or whatever for the versus games and I picked a really obscure reference to the

1954
01:42:45,080 --> 01:42:51,840
guy that did the, you know, King of 9 billion percent or whatever.

1955
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:52,840
Yes.

1956
01:42:52,840 --> 01:42:53,840
Yes.

1957
01:42:53,840 --> 01:42:54,840
I do remember that.

1958
01:42:54,840 --> 01:42:55,840
Yes.

1959
01:42:55,840 --> 01:42:56,840
That was many weeks ago.

1960
01:42:56,840 --> 01:42:57,840
That's the guy that animated this game.

1961
01:42:57,840 --> 01:42:58,840
Oh wow.

1962
01:42:58,840 --> 01:42:59,840
Okay.

1963
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:00,840
And it looks freaking awesome.

1964
01:43:00,840 --> 01:43:03,280
I don't remember the guy's name, but I'm sure the chat room will figure that out.

1965
01:43:03,280 --> 01:43:05,960
But it looks awesome.

1966
01:43:05,960 --> 01:43:12,080
Like I actually think about, I may pick this up on the PlayStation Network maybe if I have

1967
01:43:12,080 --> 01:43:16,880
the patience, I guess I could wait, but it looks so cool.

1968
01:43:16,880 --> 01:43:20,040
Who did that?

1969
01:43:20,040 --> 01:43:26,360
I'm trying to remember now.

1970
01:43:26,360 --> 01:43:27,360
I don't remember.

1971
01:43:27,360 --> 01:43:30,360
I'll look it up and chime in later.

1972
01:43:30,360 --> 01:43:32,880
And then let's see here.

1973
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:39,080
Last thing, rock band stuff coming out this week because yes, unlike certain other music

1974
01:43:39,080 --> 01:43:43,200
game platforms, they actually do have stuff that comes out every single week.

1975
01:43:43,200 --> 01:43:45,760
Not always good though.

1976
01:43:45,760 --> 01:43:51,360
This week we will be getting the Miley Cyrus pack number one, which means I guess there's

1977
01:43:51,360 --> 01:43:53,600
going to be more than one later on.

1978
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:59,080
Included in that will be a few Miley Cyrus tracks, including 7 Things, Can't Be Tamed,

1979
01:43:59,080 --> 01:44:04,080
Fly on the Wall, See You Again, and Start All Over.

1980
01:44:04,080 --> 01:44:10,400
Those are each available for $2 or the equivalent in your fictional points, and the whole pack

1981
01:44:10,400 --> 01:44:12,920
will be available for 680 Microsoft points.

1982
01:44:12,920 --> 01:44:17,200
I have no idea what that translates to in real world money, but I can guarantee it's

1983
01:44:17,200 --> 01:44:20,960
going to be slightly cheaper than buying them all separate if you're really going to buy

1984
01:44:20,960 --> 01:44:24,640
them all separate, or if you were even going to buy them at all.

1985
01:44:24,640 --> 01:44:30,040
Those will be available June 22nd.

1986
01:44:30,040 --> 01:44:32,920
I thought the listeners would appreciate a little taste of Miley Cyrus there.

1987
01:44:32,920 --> 01:44:35,760
She's more talented than her dad.

1988
01:44:35,760 --> 01:44:39,800
She's always important to her grandmother.

1989
01:44:39,800 --> 01:44:40,800
Really?

1990
01:44:40,800 --> 01:44:41,800
Yeah.

1991
01:44:41,800 --> 01:44:43,680
I have a funny story about this.

1992
01:44:43,680 --> 01:44:44,680
Can I tell it real quick?

1993
01:44:44,680 --> 01:44:45,680
Tell them.

1994
01:44:45,680 --> 01:44:50,920
I was admiring the wall of songs that they had at the harmonics booth, and one of the

1995
01:44:50,920 --> 01:44:54,240
gals that worked for harmonics kind of caught me looking at it and said, yeah, it's an impressive

1996
01:44:54,240 --> 01:44:55,240
list, huh?

1997
01:44:55,240 --> 01:44:57,400
And I said, you know, it could really use some more Lady Gaga.

1998
01:44:57,400 --> 01:45:00,160
You know, I was just kind of joking, right?

1999
01:45:00,160 --> 01:45:03,080
And she said, well, you better stay tuned for next week.

2000
01:45:03,080 --> 01:45:04,360
She says, there won't be Lady Gaga.

2001
01:45:04,360 --> 01:45:08,400
I can't tell you who it is yet, but there's definitely a lady coming to X, Y, she was

2002
01:45:08,400 --> 01:45:09,400
talking about Miley Cyrus.

2003
01:45:09,400 --> 01:45:13,080
I kind of want to go back and find her and say, that's not what I meant.

2004
01:45:13,080 --> 01:45:14,680
Or you want to punch her in the face?

2005
01:45:14,680 --> 01:45:16,160
No, she was nice.

2006
01:45:16,160 --> 01:45:19,980
I don't want to punch her in the face, but I just want to, I just want to set her straight.

2007
01:45:19,980 --> 01:45:26,760
The Miley Cyrus is not, not, not the same as Lady Gaga.

2008
01:45:26,760 --> 01:45:28,760
Thank you.

2009
01:45:28,760 --> 01:45:37,240
And, uh, the, the person that I was looking for that, uh, did the, um, Scott Pilgrim game,

2010
01:45:37,240 --> 01:45:43,280
Paul Robertson, he's the guy doing the sprites and that guy can animate like nothing else.

2011
01:45:43,280 --> 01:45:44,920
It is one sexy looking game.

2012
01:45:44,920 --> 01:45:51,520
And if that's not cool enough, uh, apparently there's a chiptune rock band, uh, on a Monoguchi

2013
01:45:51,520 --> 01:45:54,520
that's going to be, uh, providing the soundtrack for the game.

2014
01:45:54,520 --> 01:45:57,240
So seriously, pick it up.

2015
01:45:57,240 --> 01:46:02,880
If you have to wait for it to come out and, uh, Xbox live, then fine.

2016
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:05,720
By the way, can I read some of the, uh, chat room comments here?

2017
01:46:05,720 --> 01:46:08,680
Uh, Toa Gak says, fucking shit, Sky, turn it off.

2018
01:46:08,680 --> 01:46:13,920
The doctor 4945 says my achy breaky ears, uh, shadow runner says, Sky, you just blew

2019
01:46:13,920 --> 01:46:15,960
out my eardrum with that god awful music.

2020
01:46:15,960 --> 01:46:16,960
Thanks JK.

2021
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:17,960
Lulz.

2022
01:46:17,960 --> 01:46:18,960
There you go.

2023
01:46:18,960 --> 01:46:24,000
So our chat room, always appreciative of the antics here at orange lounge radio, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

2024
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:29,680
If you want to, uh, yell at me for playing certain songs on the air, uh, going over to

2025
01:46:29,680 --> 01:46:31,120
some other quick news.

2026
01:46:31,120 --> 01:46:36,200
This might've been the game of the show, uh, for Loki had he gone, uh, hello Kitty seasons

2027
01:46:36,200 --> 01:46:37,380
is coming to the Wii.

2028
01:46:37,380 --> 01:46:38,380
That's right.

2029
01:46:38,380 --> 01:46:39,380
Finally.

2030
01:46:39,380 --> 01:46:40,380
Hello Kitty is getting a Wii game.

2031
01:46:40,380 --> 01:46:43,400
I believe she had a game cube game, but now she's getting a Wii game.

2032
01:46:43,400 --> 01:46:45,760
Hello Kitty seasons will be on the Wii this holiday.

2033
01:46:45,760 --> 01:46:47,480
Um, I don't really know what it's about.

2034
01:46:47,480 --> 01:46:51,280
I think it's a puzzle game, but does anyone really fucking care?

2035
01:46:51,280 --> 01:46:54,360
I know Loki cares, but I'll send him the link so you can read it offline.

2036
01:46:54,360 --> 01:46:57,360
I bought kitty the cool so you could play it.

2037
01:46:57,360 --> 01:47:02,000
By the way, if you were thinking of picking one of these up, not hello kitty, but a, uh,

2038
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:06,520
Microsoft racing wheel, you might want to get that now because, uh, mad cats is saying

2039
01:47:06,520 --> 01:47:10,320
that, uh, Microsoft will no longer be having them produce this.

2040
01:47:10,320 --> 01:47:15,440
Uh, they really had to kind of carefully say this, but they were saying, you're going to

2041
01:47:15,440 --> 01:47:17,880
have to check with Microsoft for further information.

2042
01:47:17,880 --> 01:47:22,640
Uh, but it's mad cat's understanding that Microsoft is exiting the wheel market.

2043
01:47:22,640 --> 01:47:24,600
That was from mad cat's PR manager.

2044
01:47:24,600 --> 01:47:29,480
And obviously I can see why with, uh, the tall connect, whatever you want to call it

2045
01:47:29,480 --> 01:47:30,480
coming out soon.

2046
01:47:30,480 --> 01:47:34,840
Uh, they want to just not have, I bought one of those, um, to use with my arcade cabinet

2047
01:47:34,840 --> 01:47:40,280
actually cause I have one of those wireless adapters for the, uh, 360 controls.

2048
01:47:40,280 --> 01:47:43,160
I love my 360 controller for PC games.

2049
01:47:43,160 --> 01:47:48,280
Like I use it with crisis and I use it with grand theft auto on there, um, I haven't tried

2050
01:47:48,280 --> 01:47:54,640
the racing wheel yet with actual, any actual games, but I can't wait to use it for like,

2051
01:47:54,640 --> 01:47:59,860
you know, driving games on mame, uh, dark Tetsuya in our chat room says at least Miley

2052
01:47:59,860 --> 01:48:00,860
likes hello kitty.

2053
01:48:00,860 --> 01:48:03,520
Just going to that last story, tying things together.

2054
01:48:03,520 --> 01:48:04,520
I like that.

2055
01:48:04,520 --> 01:48:05,520
Oh yes.

2056
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:06,520
Um, more quick things.

2057
01:48:06,520 --> 01:48:09,760
Oh, to medias, uh, is, uh, coming out for the X-Box three 60.

2058
01:48:09,760 --> 01:48:15,600
I was not on the show floor, uh, but it was quickly announced it, um, Konami's press conference

2059
01:48:15,600 --> 01:48:19,680
that auto medias is going to come out, uh, on the X-Box three 60 that's right here in

2060
01:48:19,680 --> 01:48:20,680
North America.

2061
01:48:20,680 --> 01:48:24,200
Um, and I believe, what is this hot booby action in this game a little bit, right?

2062
01:48:24,200 --> 01:48:25,200
Right.

2063
01:48:25,200 --> 01:48:26,200
He is with boobies.

2064
01:48:26,200 --> 01:48:27,200
Yay.

2065
01:48:27,200 --> 01:48:29,320
So if you like Gradius and if you like boobies, then this game will be for you.

2066
01:48:29,320 --> 01:48:33,960
And it's a sequel to the Gradius booby game that was on, um, the Japanese three 60.

2067
01:48:33,960 --> 01:48:34,960
That's right.

2068
01:48:34,960 --> 01:48:35,960
Cause this is called auto medias.

2069
01:48:35,960 --> 01:48:36,960
Excellent.

2070
01:48:36,960 --> 01:48:37,960
So it's actually like kind of like a sequel.

2071
01:48:37,960 --> 01:48:39,960
It's no auto medias gorgeous.

2072
01:48:39,960 --> 01:48:40,960
No gorgeous was the original.

2073
01:48:40,960 --> 01:48:41,960
Sorry.

2074
01:48:41,960 --> 01:48:42,960
Excellence is.

2075
01:48:42,960 --> 01:48:43,960
Oh, okay.

2076
01:48:43,960 --> 01:48:44,960
Sequel, whatever.

2077
01:48:44,960 --> 01:48:45,960
Boobs and Gradius.

2078
01:48:45,960 --> 01:48:46,960
That's what they should just call the game.

2079
01:48:46,960 --> 01:48:55,280
Boobs and Gradius gratuitous booby is, um, our friends, buddy pals at bamani style.com

2080
01:48:55,280 --> 01:49:01,040
had actually a little interview with Naoki Medea at E3 asking about some of the hard

2081
01:49:01,040 --> 01:49:03,840
questions about what the hell happened to DDR.

2082
01:49:03,840 --> 01:49:08,440
Um, basically Naoki has said that his team is separated from the bamani team.

2083
01:49:08,440 --> 01:49:12,560
Uh, he's saying that basically the U S has seen many more music games and his team wanted

2084
01:49:12,560 --> 01:49:14,720
to focus on new experiences.

2085
01:49:14,720 --> 01:49:19,400
Uh, basically in nutshell, they kind of danced around the, uh, question about what happened

2086
01:49:19,400 --> 01:49:20,400
to the DDR games.

2087
01:49:20,400 --> 01:49:22,000
They were not shown at E3.

2088
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:25,480
The Wii one was, but the new ones on three 60 and PS3 weren't.

2089
01:49:25,480 --> 01:49:29,440
And basically it was basically said, they're not really wanting to show them yet.

2090
01:49:29,440 --> 01:49:34,360
Um, so, uh, some of the other things that had come up was, uh, they called out the direct

2091
01:49:34,360 --> 01:49:36,680
comparison to the power of heart ice series.

2092
01:49:36,680 --> 01:49:38,800
And now he said, yes, I did some work on that.

2093
01:49:38,800 --> 01:49:41,720
Uh, but my team is no longer a part of the money.

2094
01:49:41,720 --> 01:49:44,000
So dance masters is not able money game.

2095
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,160
That's something important to point out.

2096
01:49:46,160 --> 01:49:47,160
Hmm.

2097
01:49:47,160 --> 01:49:51,640
Uh, they also said we have professional dancers and choreographers from all over the world,

2098
01:49:51,640 --> 01:49:53,640
creating routines for dance masters.

2099
01:49:53,640 --> 01:49:58,320
So I'm hoping with that in mind, that they are actually doing different styles of dance

2100
01:49:58,320 --> 01:50:05,360
and it's not just the Para stuff that perhaps the Para stuff was able to be finished first

2101
01:50:05,360 --> 01:50:09,760
because you know, maybe they either have the motion capture data for it, or they already

2102
01:50:09,760 --> 01:50:12,320
have routines down for that kind of stuff.

2103
01:50:12,320 --> 01:50:13,320
I'm hoping.

2104
01:50:13,320 --> 01:50:17,840
I also thought this was interesting and I really hope Naoki, um, means this when he

2105
01:50:17,840 --> 01:50:21,440
says this, uh, he was asked a question by Bimani style about, uh, given that you've

2106
01:50:21,440 --> 01:50:24,260
worked on all these different types of games, do you think that peripheral based games have

2107
01:50:24,260 --> 01:50:25,880
a strong future in America?

2108
01:50:25,880 --> 01:50:30,220
And he says, okay, at Konami, we did Guitar Freak, StrawMania, 2DX, DDR, and these games

2109
01:50:30,220 --> 01:50:33,600
made the app, created the atmosphere of playing an instrument or dancing.

2110
01:50:33,600 --> 01:50:38,200
And then in America, rock band, DJ hero, guitar hero made it feel more real while still being

2111
01:50:38,200 --> 01:50:39,360
a game.

2112
01:50:39,360 --> 01:50:43,200
We are trying to create an even more real experience while still being the most fun

2113
01:50:43,200 --> 01:50:44,200
possible.

2114
01:50:44,200 --> 01:50:45,600
So we would like to be flexible.

2115
01:50:45,600 --> 01:50:48,240
Here's the part I think you should pay special attention to.

2116
01:50:48,240 --> 01:50:53,840
We would also like to collaborate in the future with famous producers and musicians to make

2117
01:50:53,840 --> 01:51:01,200
music exclusively for our games, which I think is a good idea.

2118
01:51:01,200 --> 01:51:02,520
I think that's a great idea.

2119
01:51:02,520 --> 01:51:04,520
So we'll see if that actually pans out.

2120
01:51:04,520 --> 01:51:10,700
Arguably, um, the game, you know, DDR, some of the best music in DDR was the music coming

2121
01:51:10,700 --> 01:51:11,700
from Konami.

2122
01:51:11,700 --> 01:51:13,640
So it makes sense.

2123
01:51:13,640 --> 01:51:14,640
All right.

2124
01:51:14,640 --> 01:51:19,100
How about some Twitter topics you guys, should we go to Twitter and see what the listeners

2125
01:51:19,100 --> 01:51:21,320
are showing us on their tweets?

2126
01:51:21,320 --> 01:51:25,560
By the way, if you want to show us your tweets, all you have to do is follow O L R on Twitter

2127
01:51:25,560 --> 01:51:29,040
at twitter.com slash O L R and you can send us our tweets.

2128
01:51:29,040 --> 01:51:32,720
We always say, Hey, you guys have a few minutes to get those topics in, uh, for what everyone

2129
01:51:32,720 --> 01:51:33,720
to talk about.

2130
01:51:33,720 --> 01:51:36,800
Keep in mind, I'm not going to read every tweet we get because sometimes you guys link

2131
01:51:36,800 --> 01:51:38,980
to stories that are going to come up a little later in the show.

2132
01:51:38,980 --> 01:51:40,800
So it's not because I don't like you.

2133
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:41,800
I promise.

2134
01:51:41,800 --> 01:51:43,400
Uh, let's see.

2135
01:51:43,400 --> 01:51:48,000
Um, I thought this was an interesting link here from tiger claw three Oh five on Twitter

2136
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:51,300
is sending us this Sony downplays the three DS.

2137
01:51:51,300 --> 01:51:55,160
Because you know, Sony, Sony was trying to show a lot of three D at their conference

2138
01:51:55,160 --> 01:51:56,160
too.

2139
01:51:56,160 --> 01:51:58,800
And then Nintendo just kind of came out and said, well, you don't need glasses for ours.

2140
01:51:58,800 --> 01:51:59,800
Uh huh.

2141
01:51:59,800 --> 01:52:00,800
So here it is.

2142
01:52:00,800 --> 01:52:05,000
Uh, Sony, it kind of a downplay this a little bit cast her eyes specifically.

2143
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:11,220
He said, quote, based off internally conducted research, naked eye, three D for portables

2144
01:52:11,220 --> 01:52:13,720
does not have high precision.

2145
01:52:13,720 --> 01:52:16,400
And at present there are limitations.

2146
01:52:16,400 --> 01:52:22,400
He would not comment on the three DS itself, however, because he had not yet seen the system.

2147
01:52:22,400 --> 01:52:25,360
Here's the problem, Mr. Her eye.

2148
01:52:25,360 --> 01:52:28,240
They've got the games to back it up.

2149
01:52:28,240 --> 01:52:32,260
Whereas I dunno, I guess I should say some of the games that sound like they're a pretty

2150
01:52:32,260 --> 01:52:38,340
awesome on them, the Sony, uh, uh, three D experience sound pretty cool, but the move

2151
01:52:38,340 --> 01:52:40,400
I'm a little less excited about.

2152
01:52:40,400 --> 01:52:45,160
It's just that they, I mean, when they come up with him with questions like that, what's

2153
01:52:45,160 --> 01:52:46,160
he going to say?

2154
01:52:46,160 --> 01:52:47,160
Whoa.

2155
01:52:47,160 --> 01:52:48,160
That's amazing.

2156
01:52:48,160 --> 01:52:49,160
Wish we had thought of that.

2157
01:52:49,160 --> 01:52:53,440
You know, I mean, he's obviously going to try to put something Microsoft and Nintendo

2158
01:52:53,440 --> 01:52:58,640
up until connect was announced, was kind of trading these little like, you know, hearts

2159
01:52:58,640 --> 01:53:00,040
for each other.

2160
01:53:00,040 --> 01:53:04,800
You know, they used to kind of compliment each other until Microsoft decided they were

2161
01:53:04,800 --> 01:53:07,920
not going to have any of this competition anymore and go right after it.

2162
01:53:07,920 --> 01:53:10,320
It's been fun playing with you, but now you must die.

2163
01:53:10,320 --> 01:53:11,320
Exactly.

2164
01:53:11,320 --> 01:53:16,800
Dark Tetsuya links us to a story where apparently Reggie has said, you know, maybe young kids

2165
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:22,320
should probably not play the three DS, but he actually means very young children.

2166
01:53:22,320 --> 01:53:25,460
We recommend that very young children not look at the three D images.

2167
01:53:25,460 --> 01:53:29,520
That's because in young children, the muscles for the eyes are not fully formed.

2168
01:53:29,520 --> 01:53:32,860
This is the same messaging that the industry is putting out with three D movies.

2169
01:53:32,860 --> 01:53:34,240
So it is a standard protocol.

2170
01:53:34,240 --> 01:53:38,160
We have the same type of messaging for the virtual boy as an example.

2171
01:53:38,160 --> 01:53:43,440
I tend to make my baby cross-eyed seven years or older.

2172
01:53:43,440 --> 01:53:46,920
According to Reggie fees and may, I would be very, again, I think the disclaimers on

2173
01:53:46,920 --> 01:53:50,240
this thing are going to be a mile long.

2174
01:53:50,240 --> 01:53:54,940
Alpha Kana gram is saying CH children of eat or chart child of Eden three DS.

2175
01:53:54,940 --> 01:53:55,940
Good idea.

2176
01:53:55,940 --> 01:53:56,940
Am I right?

2177
01:53:56,940 --> 01:53:57,940
I mean, it would look cool on three DS.

2178
01:53:57,940 --> 01:53:59,480
It's from alpha Kana gram.

2179
01:53:59,480 --> 01:54:03,600
Uh, that might be too much going on.

2180
01:54:03,600 --> 01:54:07,400
That might be too much for the eyes, but it would be, yeah, it'd be a little tough.

2181
01:54:07,400 --> 01:54:11,760
I think something that's more wireframe like rez would lend itself a little easier to the

2182
01:54:11,760 --> 01:54:15,040
three D stuff than maybe child of Eden.

2183
01:54:15,040 --> 01:54:18,880
I would like to see a rez three D port, you know, something we didn't talk a lot about,

2184
01:54:18,880 --> 01:54:22,920
but there's an, I apologize if I'm, I'm mentioning a story that's coming up, but there's hella

2185
01:54:22,920 --> 01:54:26,040
hella ports being planned for the DS.

2186
01:54:26,040 --> 01:54:29,760
Like, you know, if you think it was bad, all the stuff that's coming out now, man, they

2187
01:54:29,760 --> 01:54:31,400
want to go back and do all these games.

2188
01:54:31,400 --> 01:54:36,000
One of the games I played on the three DS was the old shooter, old shooter by Namco

2189
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:37,800
Xevious.

2190
01:54:37,800 --> 01:54:38,800
That's a great game.

2191
01:54:38,800 --> 01:54:41,400
And it was three D. That's fantastic.

2192
01:54:41,400 --> 01:54:44,120
And there's all these other old school three D games are going to go back and do.

2193
01:54:44,120 --> 01:54:48,000
You probably heard about ocarina of time and I guess there's this list somewhere that details

2194
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:53,120
all these games that into no one's to do in three D. So those are actually, they're not

2195
01:54:53,120 --> 01:54:54,280
games that they want to do.

2196
01:54:54,280 --> 01:54:55,720
They're in development already.

2197
01:54:55,720 --> 01:54:56,720
Geez.

2198
01:54:56,720 --> 01:55:01,120
Bob, what my brain just did something weird.

2199
01:55:01,120 --> 01:55:05,480
It combined ocarina of time with weird Al doing the soundtrack.

2200
01:55:05,480 --> 01:55:10,400
What the poker arena of time, that'd be the greatest thing ever.

2201
01:55:10,400 --> 01:55:11,400
That was so strange.

2202
01:55:11,400 --> 01:55:12,400
All right.

2203
01:55:12,400 --> 01:55:13,400
I had to share that.

2204
01:55:13,400 --> 01:55:14,920
It just popped into my head.

2205
01:55:14,920 --> 01:55:15,920
Seriously.

2206
01:55:15,920 --> 01:55:16,920
Weird Al game.

2207
01:55:16,920 --> 01:55:18,320
Where is it?

2208
01:55:18,320 --> 01:55:23,160
There has not been a weird Al game and Gallagher had a video game.

2209
01:55:23,160 --> 01:55:28,040
That is just blasphemy that there has been no weird Al video game.

2210
01:55:28,040 --> 01:55:33,200
And also I want to say I am also very disappointed with TV being the way it is nowadays.

2211
01:55:33,200 --> 01:55:39,200
We should really seriously have our own UHF channel by now.

2212
01:55:39,200 --> 01:55:42,720
Ray Iannami, oops sorry that was a retweet not a question.

2213
01:55:42,720 --> 01:55:46,440
Richard Zard says I'm very upset I cannot meet up with you at E3.

2214
01:55:46,440 --> 01:55:48,840
I tried to meet up with you at E3 but that didn't go so well.

2215
01:55:48,840 --> 01:55:52,200
I was really looking forward to meeting you after three years of listening.

2216
01:55:52,200 --> 01:55:56,700
Well unfortunately E3 is probably like the worst possible place to do a meetup because

2217
01:55:56,700 --> 01:56:01,560
there's so much going on at E3.

2218
01:56:01,560 --> 01:56:03,840
You know unfortunately it doesn't lend itself as well to meetups.

2219
01:56:03,840 --> 01:56:07,800
It's like things like PAX and so forth and you know we were just there was just too much

2220
01:56:07,800 --> 01:56:09,120
going on.

2221
01:56:09,120 --> 01:56:13,520
But honestly I didn't know there was an interest beforehand for folks to kind of want to meet

2222
01:56:13,520 --> 01:56:14,520
up.

2223
01:56:14,520 --> 01:56:18,280
I didn't think enough of our listeners really went to the show but now that I know there

2224
01:56:18,280 --> 01:56:22,440
are some I guess next year maybe we'll plan like a dinner one night or something we could

2225
01:56:22,440 --> 01:56:23,440
probably do.

2226
01:56:23,440 --> 01:56:28,080
But just on the show floor is just really like the worst possible place to have you

2227
01:56:28,080 --> 01:56:31,880
know OLR reunions and so forth.

2228
01:56:31,880 --> 01:56:37,360
SGA 100 Matt is asking us out of all the E3's you guys slash gal have gone to which is your

2229
01:56:37,360 --> 01:56:44,680
fave worst and where does this one stack up to those?

2230
01:56:44,680 --> 01:56:49,960
Easy my favorite was my first one because you never forget your first and that was also

2231
01:56:49,960 --> 01:56:55,080
the year we met like a Kiryamoka and I had like the Silent Hill set up and it was a cool

2232
01:56:55,080 --> 01:56:56,080
year.

2233
01:56:56,080 --> 01:56:57,080
The room.

2234
01:56:57,080 --> 01:57:02,320
And then later also Bamani or I'm sorry 2DX was announced for America right or maybe that

2235
01:57:02,320 --> 01:57:03,320
was the next year.

2236
01:57:03,320 --> 01:57:04,320
No that was.

2237
01:57:04,320 --> 01:57:06,280
We had the distorted the second year I think.

2238
01:57:06,280 --> 01:57:07,760
Oh maybe that's right.

2239
01:57:07,760 --> 01:57:11,520
And the karaoke revolution country.

2240
01:57:11,520 --> 01:57:17,760
My least favorite year was 2006 the year right before the break because that was year where

2241
01:57:17,760 --> 01:57:22,440
Paris Hilton had a line going around there's just too damn many people at E3 and it kind

2242
01:57:22,440 --> 01:57:24,740
of became a little bit of a joke.

2243
01:57:24,740 --> 01:57:30,100
And then this year would be my second favorite E3 I felt that I just I got to do so much

2244
01:57:30,100 --> 01:57:35,600
this year that I hadn't done in years past and I was keeping myself so busy with stuff

2245
01:57:35,600 --> 01:57:38,640
that I was very pleased with the show this year and I think there was just a lot of good

2246
01:57:38,640 --> 01:57:42,600
tech to see because I don't think last year's show was very good either that would probably

2247
01:57:42,600 --> 01:57:45,800
be my second least favorite show next to the 06 show.

2248
01:57:45,800 --> 01:57:52,440
So I would rank them 04, 10, 05, 09, 06.

2249
01:57:52,440 --> 01:57:58,080
Well I can't really rank any of mine I mean there's good experiences and bad experiences

2250
01:57:58,080 --> 01:58:01,720
and not all of them I link with the convention itself.

2251
01:58:01,720 --> 01:58:12,480
So I would say I think that I really did like 2006 just because I got in a ton of awesome

2252
01:58:12,480 --> 01:58:17,560
interviews that year and the year before that was pretty cool too because I piggybacked

2253
01:58:17,560 --> 01:58:24,360
on my friend's press pass and the year before that was great because it was my first E3

2254
01:58:24,360 --> 01:58:25,360
and I got in.

2255
01:58:25,360 --> 01:58:30,760
I'd actually have to say though that my favorite experience of all the E3s was meeting Koji

2256
01:58:30,760 --> 01:58:37,400
Kondo and getting it I found the little book with his autograph and that was just fantastic

2257
01:58:37,400 --> 01:58:42,080
for me of course Dan his highlight is well the picture that's up there of him meeting

2258
01:58:42,080 --> 01:58:50,640
Yu Suzuki I know that other than that though I did have a really massive migraine and having

2259
01:58:50,640 --> 01:58:56,440
aching feet was kind of suck and Paris Hilton suck but you know what was actually cool was

2260
01:58:56,440 --> 01:59:00,760
meeting the Harlem Globetrotters oh cool they were doing that charity thing so that was

2261
01:59:00,760 --> 01:59:01,760
pretty cool.

2262
01:59:01,760 --> 01:59:05,840
Takeo Ray sends us a message on Twitter have you seen the Penny Arcade comic about the

2263
01:59:05,840 --> 01:59:10,720
E3 press conferences pretty accurate retelling oh god yes I did see that and it was great

2264
01:59:10,720 --> 01:59:15,560
I laughed so hard somebody actually sent that to me on my phone while I was at E3 and I

2265
01:59:15,560 --> 01:59:20,880
love the Reggie Fils-Aime in the middle panel new Zelda new Goldeneye new Kirby new Metroid

2266
01:59:20,880 --> 01:59:25,560
new Kid Icarus new 3D shit no glasses Santa Claus is real he's in our booth and he's giving

2267
01:59:25,560 --> 01:59:31,920
out fucking hand jogs Nintendo bitches we out is that great retelling of what actually

2268
01:59:31,920 --> 01:59:36,920
happened that's gonna do it for Twitter topics tonight twitter.com slash olr thank you guys

2269
01:59:36,920 --> 01:59:42,560
who submitted topics tonight how about some more news low-key what you got for us all

2270
01:59:42,560 --> 01:59:47,360
right well let's see there's some stuff I kind of talked about a little bit earlier

2271
01:59:47,360 --> 01:59:51,480
Ubisoft they had a lot of things that were announced during their press conference that

2272
01:59:51,480 --> 01:59:56,360
kind of people scratching my head because they weren't really game video games perhaps

2273
01:59:56,360 --> 02:00:04,160
I mean they're sort of games but not quite I don't know so for example mania planet was

2274
02:00:04,160 --> 02:00:09,420
something that was announced in a partnership that between the company behind the track

2275
02:00:09,420 --> 02:00:17,240
mania series and nadio and Ubisoft and one of the things that they of course showed off

2276
02:00:17,240 --> 02:00:22,200
which is pretty awesome was track mania 2 gorgeous looking game they're going to be

2277
02:00:22,200 --> 02:00:27,360
having a beta coming out for that you can test it out on this fourth quarter of this

2278
02:00:27,360 --> 02:00:32,560
year shoot mania which is going to be the new kind of first-person shooter type of game

2279
02:00:32,560 --> 02:00:37,400
that you'll be able to create custom levels for they're gonna have a beta for that sometime

2280
02:00:37,400 --> 02:00:41,320
the first quarter of 2011 and finally quest mania which is going to be kind of like their

2281
02:00:41,320 --> 02:00:46,040
RPG maker type of game that will be available for beta at some point they haven't really

2282
02:00:46,040 --> 02:00:50,880
said when but it's kind of neat though because I know the track me I'm seriously underrated

2283
02:00:50,880 --> 02:00:57,240
and she did better on consoles ended it really needs to come to like Xbox Live Arcade or

2284
02:00:57,240 --> 02:01:05,520
even just like 360 or Playstation 3 it'd be really awesome one of the games I I kind of

2285
02:01:05,520 --> 02:01:11,920
looked at him like you know had I seen this a few years ago or had it been actually cues

2286
02:01:11,920 --> 02:01:17,960
are I may have to pick this up battle tag which is a game that is basically laser tag

2287
02:01:17,960 --> 02:01:22,920
you've got a vest in these pistols that you run around with and these different targets

2288
02:01:22,920 --> 02:01:28,320
that you can use for like checkpoints or whatever you can create your own kind of games out

2289
02:01:28,320 --> 02:01:33,920
of it and it ties in with your PC which is kind of the scorekeeper kind of like the game

2290
02:01:33,920 --> 02:01:38,960
master for the stuff and so they announced that it's kind of neat something you would

2291
02:01:38,960 --> 02:01:43,960
probably see it like kencha hall if there was a kencha hall anymore but that's something

2292
02:01:43,960 --> 02:01:49,800
else coming out later this year on PC not really like a game per se that you can't like

2293
02:01:49,800 --> 02:01:54,360
just play like a first person shooter game with it on your PC it's actually just something

2294
02:01:54,360 --> 02:01:59,080
that uses your PC for like scoring which is interesting and then the game that was pretty

2295
02:01:59,080 --> 02:02:08,080
much you know the Wii Vitality sensor but not energy and apparently energy was a game

2296
02:02:08,080 --> 02:02:12,540
that had a sensor that you would put on your finger or penis because you know it's going

2297
02:02:12,540 --> 02:02:18,760
to happen and you would use this to kind of relax they had a breathing exercise that you

2298
02:02:18,760 --> 02:02:26,640
could do they made Joel McHale do that because he was hosting the whole event and it's interesting

2299
02:02:26,640 --> 02:02:33,720
I guess I don't know it's supposed to make you feel good which I guess putting your penis

2300
02:02:33,720 --> 02:02:38,200
in the sensor might do that I don't know and that's why Santa Claus is at E3 I did post

2301
02:02:38,200 --> 02:02:45,040
that I'm like oh good well energy what are they thinking time to penis is what exactly

2302
02:02:45,040 --> 02:02:49,800
all right well moving on with some more news Silent Hill there was some news about that

2303
02:02:49,800 --> 02:02:53,600
at E3 this year sadly it was not playable on the show floor but there was a new trailer

2304
02:02:53,600 --> 02:02:57,800
that leaked to the internet and so perhaps you saw some information on that is gone to

2305
02:02:57,800 --> 02:03:03,640
a new developer it's Vatra is now developing this game so it's going to be very different

2306
02:03:03,640 --> 02:03:09,900
from me Silent Hill home shattered memories as well as Silent Hill homecoming also missing

2307
02:03:09,900 --> 02:03:15,240
from this Silent Hill and this is huge Akira Yamaoka is not going to be a part of the new

2308
02:03:15,240 --> 02:03:22,440
Silent Hill game so this means the new replacement will be Daniel Licht he does the theme song

2309
02:03:22,440 --> 02:03:27,480
for Dexter the TV show and he also has done Hellraiser and Children of the Corn so I guess

2310
02:03:27,480 --> 02:03:32,000
that's kind of cool sadly it's going to be not the same without Akira Yamaoka but at

2311
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:36,200
the same time I'm looking forward to seeing what Silent Hill and new people's hands is

2312
02:03:36,200 --> 02:03:40,440
going to be by the way the story if you haven't seen the trailer yet it's about a prison inmate

2313
02:03:40,440 --> 02:03:44,440
and the transport vehicle basically you know overturns or something and now he's in the

2314
02:03:44,440 --> 02:03:49,120
fog of Silent Hill which I noticed looked a lot like the movie so I guess you know they're

2315
02:03:49,120 --> 02:03:53,880
incorporating the movie into the cannon or something I don't know so they are talking

2316
02:03:53,880 --> 02:03:59,720
about evolving the combat in a different direction as opposed to doing one or the other from

2317
02:03:59,720 --> 02:04:05,480
the previous games so I don't know Dark Sakura I know you're a big Silent Hill fan are you

2318
02:04:05,480 --> 02:04:09,640
hopeful about the new Silent Hill game are you kind of like oh too much has changed this

2319
02:04:09,640 --> 02:04:16,200
isn't going to be Silent Hill anymore I really have to see I'm going to reserve judgment

2320
02:04:16,200 --> 02:04:19,640
that's a fair way to look at it definitely check out the trailer though if you haven't

2321
02:04:19,640 --> 02:04:23,800
already it was pretty cool I gotta say all right what do you have for us Dark Sakura

2322
02:04:23,800 --> 02:04:29,400
well um for those who have been interested in Fallout Online and I know that I've been

2323
02:04:29,400 --> 02:04:32,440
kind of interested well you know first of all let me rewind just a little bit did you

2324
02:04:32,440 --> 02:04:39,560
guys see the Fallout New Vegas trailer everything at Bethesda was appointment only um and I

2325
02:04:39,560 --> 02:04:43,560
didn't see that trailer online no because I haven't even played Fallout 3 well I'm buying

2326
02:04:43,560 --> 02:04:47,920
a little bit the trailer was online and it was great cool yeah um it was pretty funny

2327
02:04:47,920 --> 02:04:55,320
actually Bobby was telling me it was very uh very neon in there yeah um well Fallout

2328
02:04:55,320 --> 02:05:05,240
um online um is actually starting to uh solicit for uh betas for uh for their open beta so

2329
02:05:05,240 --> 02:05:11,160
um if you go to the Fallout Online website um you should uh I actually I filled out the

2330
02:05:11,160 --> 02:05:14,180
little form it's just like a little form you sign up for their mailing list and they'll

2331
02:05:14,180 --> 02:05:21,320
send you information on the beta eventually um but the you know they did have uh Interplay

2332
02:05:21,320 --> 02:05:27,920
had some legal issues for a while um but now it's finally seems like it's going forward

2333
02:05:27,920 --> 02:05:38,000
so let's hope so I could deal with some post-apocalyptic you know killing of people too many MMOs so

2334
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:42,560
many I'm still stuck on Star Trek Online nothing's gonna get me I know you are I know it doesn't

2335
02:05:42,560 --> 02:05:48,040
mean I cannot flirt a little bit I'm not in a serious committed relationship nice I have

2336
02:05:48,040 --> 02:05:54,160
an open relationship with Star Trek Online you can look but you just can't touch I can

2337
02:05:54,160 --> 02:06:04,600
touch all I want to I trusted I'll always come back alright uh let's go to one more

2338
02:06:04,600 --> 02:06:09,120
news story and then we got the mailbag coming at you a mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

2339
02:06:09,120 --> 02:06:13,960
uh one of the things that was shown off during the Konami press conference is of course Def

2340
02:06:13,960 --> 02:06:19,240
Jam rap star uh what's kind of interesting though is they're gonna have this whole uh

2341
02:06:19,240 --> 02:06:25,220
online aspect a lot of community features um different you know taunts and stuff like

2342
02:06:25,220 --> 02:06:31,760
you can do you know uh rap battles or whatever and actually record different things and have

2343
02:06:31,760 --> 02:06:38,320
like a community I guess there's gonna be uh Def Jam talent scouts and stuff like that

2344
02:06:38,320 --> 02:06:46,760
oh wow keeping an eye on the uh good rap star players and whatnot uh that's it I don't know

2345
02:06:46,760 --> 02:06:51,320
it's a lot of community stuff which is really cool uh you know what's interesting is that

2346
02:06:51,320 --> 02:06:56,760
Def Jam rap star actually looks like a really solid game it's a bummer that I'm not as interested

2347
02:06:56,760 --> 02:07:01,000
in the content there you know I can't rap please but it actually you know just kind

2348
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:03,740
of looking at it and watching other people playing it and then hearing about all this

2349
02:07:03,740 --> 02:07:08,560
community stuff I was kind of like why can't some of the other music games take a page

2350
02:07:08,560 --> 02:07:15,080
from this Konami seriously you have this framework you know built for rap star just now make

2351
02:07:15,080 --> 02:07:21,960
it into a singing game and call it karaoke revolution or you put this next to the glee

2352
02:07:21,960 --> 02:07:26,320
game that they were also showing off and the glee game looks pathetic yeah the absolutely

2353
02:07:26,320 --> 02:07:31,960
pathetic game is just a simple you know try to grab it you know the market for the glee

2354
02:07:31,960 --> 02:07:38,320
stuff because those damn glee albums are top of the charts you know great we have people

2355
02:07:38,320 --> 02:07:46,200
covering songs and it's popular now um I don't know it's it's interesting but if they actually

2356
02:07:46,200 --> 02:07:50,800
put out a solid music game and support it with enough download content and had all the

2357
02:07:50,800 --> 02:07:56,640
community stuff I think it would do really well I agree because yeah the Def Jam game

2358
02:07:56,640 --> 02:08:01,880
actually it actually I gotta say this I actually kind of wanted to play it you know in the

2359
02:08:01,880 --> 02:08:08,760
privacy of my own home when nobody's watching I kind of want Irene to play it she would

2360
02:08:08,760 --> 02:08:14,440
be a lot of fun you know my birthday is coming up maybe I should ask the birthday fairy for

2361
02:08:14,440 --> 02:08:19,640
some Irene playing Def Jam rap star she could get discovered by a Def Jam scout talent you

2362
02:08:19,640 --> 02:08:25,800
know they had some rap stars actually there at E3 doing the rapping that's cool they had

2363
02:08:25,800 --> 02:08:30,120
a Konami had a whole new booth layout this year it hasn't looked like it has in years

2364
02:08:30,120 --> 02:08:35,480
past they were able to showcase several games it was kind of cool and you know just a kind

2365
02:08:35,480 --> 02:08:38,680
of a neat game because I don't really care about wrestling games that much but the luchador

2366
02:08:38,680 --> 02:08:44,440
game looks awesome lucha libre AAA good god did they have a whole show during that they

2367
02:08:44,440 --> 02:08:49,120
didn't just have the the game at Konami's booth but then I guess the developers or somebody

2368
02:08:49,120 --> 02:08:52,880
else had a whole huge area right behind it where they were doing the whole who's gonna

2369
02:08:52,880 --> 02:08:56,440
be on the box for the game that's awesome and just all these wrestling matches going

2370
02:08:56,440 --> 02:09:01,960
on all day I guess I was glad it kind of drew people in and kept them away from other stuff

2371
02:09:01,960 --> 02:09:08,960
but I was just like dang it was a heck of people over there I didn't realize the wrestling

2372
02:09:08,960 --> 02:09:20,840
was so popular anyhow let's go to the mailbag mailbag orange launch radio.com every week

2373
02:09:20,840 --> 02:09:24,360
we dive in the mailbag and read emails for you guys I'm gonna take over this week since

2375
02:09:30,080 --> 02:09:35,040
she'll be better soon although I should say there's not a lot to read I'm very disappointed

2376
02:09:35,040 --> 02:09:40,960
in the listenership that during E3 week there's only two emails that you guys want us to read

2377

2383
02:10:07,760 --> 02:10:14,840
for the ps3 is related to the introduction of steam on the Mac yes and no I don't think

2384
02:10:14,840 --> 02:10:20,520
they're necessarily directly related I think it's more of a you know hey yay valve and

2385
02:10:20,520 --> 02:10:26,440
ps3 are playing nicely but I think definitely it it is a huge card in steam's pocket that

2386
02:10:26,440 --> 02:10:30,440
it's multi-platform you know I'm gonna go off in a different direction though speaking

2387
02:10:30,440 --> 02:10:34,680
of like gaming on the Mac and so forth one thing we haven't talked much about that on

2388
02:10:34,680 --> 02:10:40,320
live was there at E3 and they had a pretty big presence and you know from the demos they

2389
02:10:40,320 --> 02:10:44,320
were showing it looked pretty good like the games were playing pretty well over those

2390
02:10:44,320 --> 02:10:50,340
little console boxes and apparently the system is out now on the PC and the Mac and apparently

2391
02:10:50,340 --> 02:10:55,760
it I'm even seeing the feedback on Twitter and so forth it actually runs pretty well

2392
02:10:55,760 --> 02:11:01,020
well I'll be damned I know I'll be damned huh who knew who knew but as far as steam

2393
02:11:01,020 --> 02:11:05,800
goes you know I think certainly steam is trying to expand all these different places because

2394
02:11:05,800 --> 02:11:09,860
it definitely looks good for them I don't know why I went on the tangent of on life

2395
02:11:09,860 --> 02:11:15,080
but I guess just the whole like new stuff on the Mac Mac gamers what a niche audience

2396
02:11:15,080 --> 02:11:18,400
no I'm just kidding Mac gamers have had a lot to celebrate this year I'll tell you that

2397
02:11:18,400 --> 02:11:22,580
much that's for sure.

2398
02:11:22,580 --> 02:11:27,840
Going to this other email from Brian S. who didn't have a fancy little nickname but we'll

2399
02:11:27,840 --> 02:11:32,820
say Brian S. Hey OLR gang while reading the news on the PS move and the MS connect I started

2400
02:11:32,820 --> 02:11:37,160
wondering these two items are really just expensive peripherals for a console but if

2401
02:11:37,160 --> 02:11:42,300
any console peripherals really been successful sure during the NES era I loved power glove

2402
02:11:42,300 --> 02:11:46,820
and play track and field on the power pad but just like R.O.B. they never have more

2403
02:11:46,820 --> 02:11:52,160
than one or two games for them ignoring peripherals that are specifically made for a game I.E.

2404
02:11:52,160 --> 02:11:57,980
music and dance genre games most peripherals like the super scope Sega CD 32 X PS 2 hard

2405
02:11:57,980 --> 02:12:02,320
drive I toy and probably quite a few others I can't remember seem to lack support and

2406
02:12:02,320 --> 02:12:06,820
third party game development initial launch titles do you think the same could happen

2407
02:12:06,820 --> 02:12:14,660
to connect slash move if initial game sales are low no I say well I say yes as far as

2408
02:12:14,660 --> 02:12:21,060
at least the move is concerned I think though it's tricky because you say well you can count

2409
02:12:21,060 --> 02:12:25,100
these games but you can't count these well selling games I mean I realize that the music

2410
02:12:25,100 --> 02:12:29,140
and dance things are a little more niche but if you look at connect as like really opening

2411
02:12:29,140 --> 02:12:34,300
up the exercise exercise gaming thing then it's a little niche too well let's look at

2412
02:12:34,300 --> 02:12:39,780
the Wii Fit balance board they use that in a lot of games I mean it's an add-on thing

2413
02:12:39,780 --> 02:12:46,020
but I mean they use that we motion plus it's being used in a lot of things and I toy was

2414
02:12:46,020 --> 02:12:49,780
used a lot more than I think you might be given it credit for especially in games for

2415
02:12:49,780 --> 02:12:54,700
the younger audience I mean those aren't really specialized peripherals or anything but I

2416
02:12:54,700 --> 02:12:57,740
mean if you think about a lot of stuff that they put out that specialized peripherals

2417
02:12:57,740 --> 02:13:01,740
I mean it's specialized for a reason it's only gonna be used for a few things I mean

2418
02:13:01,740 --> 02:13:07,620
I understand what you're talking about like the whole I toy and the PlayStation I camera

2419
02:13:07,620 --> 02:13:12,780
or the Xbox 360 motion camera which was a big waste of money and I need to turn that

2420
02:13:12,780 --> 02:13:19,060
in for some like store credit somewhere because I would have waste that turn out being exactly

2421
02:13:19,060 --> 02:13:26,540
so yeah I mean I understand that and you know the expectations I guess for that were a little

2422
02:13:26,540 --> 02:13:31,900
bit greater than they were now because I think with the PlayStation well even like with the

2423
02:13:31,900 --> 02:13:35,860
motion camera on the Xbox 360 I think they were thinking it's going to be doing these

2424
02:13:35,860 --> 02:13:40,420
kind of connect things but it it just it doesn't have the technology that really support that

2425
02:13:40,420 --> 02:13:49,580
why why aren't our chats is saying yes absolutely yes to this question of will the same fate

2426
02:13:49,580 --> 02:13:54,100
be met if initial game sales are low he's saying this is why Kinect should be $99 and

2427
02:13:54,100 --> 02:13:58,580
not a penny more I agree that if they don't have a really awesome game pack in with this

2428
02:13:58,580 --> 02:14:08,580
game or with connect the 150 is unfortunately past the sweet spot a lot of people are going

2429
02:14:08,580 --> 02:14:13,980
to be in for as unpleasant shock to that if connect is $150 and it's sitting right next

2430
02:14:13,980 --> 02:14:18,300
to a weed it's also $150 there's going to be people out there that don't realize you

2431
02:14:18,300 --> 02:14:23,740
need an Xbox 360 to actually use Kinect and it's going to be depressing for some people

2432
02:14:23,740 --> 02:14:29,860
bull they're probably trying to package you know their Xbox 360 Kinect combo or something

2433
02:14:29,860 --> 02:14:33,660
like that that's why I'm saying you know you guys watch out because you're going to see

2434
02:14:33,660 --> 02:14:39,600
the Kinect for $150 or whatever but you watch them drop the console price or something like

2435
02:14:39,600 --> 02:14:47,100
ridiculous you know you may see they were saying that there isn't right now a $199 bundle

2436
02:14:47,100 --> 02:14:54,380
but there will be a $199 skew for the Xbox 360 come on the holiday so they're putting

2437
02:14:54,380 --> 02:15:00,340
out something I a little more here at the end of the email dark soccer and sky I hope

2438
02:15:00,340 --> 02:15:04,220
you're both feeling better if not I hope you get well soon oh thank you I'm doing much

2439
02:15:04,220 --> 02:15:07,940
better than it was the nightly show I am better it's just that my throat was really damaged

2440
02:15:07,940 --> 02:15:12,780
and it hasn't fully healed yet and that's from Brian s again and also one more thing

2441
02:15:12,780 --> 02:15:17,180
PS part of the reason I wrote this email was to have a reason to write I love to power

2442
02:15:17,180 --> 02:15:22,700
glove it's so bad there you go that's your emails for this week mailbag at orange lounge

2443
02:15:22,700 --> 02:15:26,940
radio.com please fill up our mailbag and so that way when dark soccer's voice is all better

2444
02:15:26,940 --> 02:15:31,860
she has some work to do we like giving dark soccer lots of work to do don't we all right

2445
02:15:31,860 --> 02:15:35,060
some more gaming news for you guys and then we're going to open up the skype line at one

2446
02:15:35,060 --> 02:15:40,900
eight seven seven game OLR but don't call yet it ain't open yet Loki one last things

2447
02:15:40,900 --> 02:15:45,860
that they showed off during the Ubisoft press conference and they didn't really show anything

2448
02:15:45,860 --> 02:15:50,860
they just kind of hinted at that it's coming the Michael Jackson game the one that was

2449
02:15:50,860 --> 02:15:57,500
rumored to be in development is now being developed by Ubisoft and no word exactly on

2450
02:15:57,500 --> 02:16:02,060
what it is but it's something that's possibly going to be some singing dancing game that

2451
02:16:02,060 --> 02:16:08,460
does support the connect and I think it's very sad that it's not Sega it is sad that

2452
02:16:08,460 --> 02:16:15,940
should have been Sega but is Sega and Michael Jackson were BFFs it's moonwalker 2 but uh

2453
02:16:15,940 --> 02:16:19,740
yet unclear exactly what it's supposed to be but they're saying that the game will be

2454
02:16:19,740 --> 02:16:28,020
available for connect on Xbox 360 PlayStation move on the ps3 PSP Wii and DS anywhere they

2455
02:16:28,020 --> 02:16:33,740
can milk that guy for you know more money in the afterlife they will in other words

2456
02:16:33,740 --> 02:16:40,020
yeah I'm all right I'm right you're right hey this is pretty cool cuz I remember these

2457
02:16:40,020 --> 02:16:44,940
games they were a lot of fun apparently Burger King is going to be coming back to the 360

2458
02:16:44,940 --> 02:16:48,740
that's right the Burger King guy is coming back and this time it has to do with connect

2459
02:16:48,740 --> 02:16:53,820
games buying all of them every single one I don't care how terrible they are I am buying

2460
02:16:53,820 --> 02:16:59,020
all of them no news on the details no news on the style no news on the number of games

2461
02:16:59,020 --> 02:17:04,740
all this being said so far is from Burger King chief marketing officer Mike Capit saying

2462
02:17:04,740 --> 02:17:09,380
our first endeavor with Xbox 360 took the gaming world by storm so we couldn't pass

2463
02:17:09,380 --> 02:17:13,660
up the chance to come together on another cutting edge program during this year's promotion

2464
02:17:13,660 --> 02:17:17,900
our guests can look forward to an even greater adventure that will stimulate the imaginations

2465
02:17:17,900 --> 02:17:22,220
of gamers and entertainment lovers of all shapes and sizes they were so like sneak king

2466
02:17:22,220 --> 02:17:28,820
was so creepy you don't understand you cannot get more creepier than that game it is absolutely

2467
02:17:28,820 --> 02:17:33,740
worth the money I don't care how terrible they are because terrible games can sometimes

2468
02:17:33,740 --> 02:17:41,280
be good games like for example driver 3 terrible game let's not forget the games were five

2469
02:17:41,280 --> 02:17:47,360
dollars four dollars three ninety nine my bad four dollars is an amazing deal hopefully

2470
02:17:47,360 --> 02:17:54,860
they're just as expensive this year that'd be great that should be the pack-in right

2471
02:17:54,860 --> 02:18:02,740
there you know there you go there's your reason to plunk 150 on connect there you go skeptics

2472
02:18:02,740 --> 02:18:09,500
I think sneaking to featuring connect I think it's gonna be pretty awesome I I high hopes

2473
02:18:09,500 --> 02:18:18,620
for the connect don't screw me again damn camera games I learned my lesson with I actually

2474
02:18:18,620 --> 02:18:23,440
bought the camera for every single damn system they've all failed me so far except I did

2475
02:18:23,440 --> 02:18:31,260
not buy the camera those on the week sound like exercise games but anyways so yeah there's

2476
02:18:31,260 --> 02:18:35,200
some more features being announced for a little big planet to lots of cool stuff that they're

2477
02:18:35,200 --> 02:18:41,940
showing the whole community features one aspect they're saying that of course getting revamped

2478
02:18:41,940 --> 02:18:48,860
is all the stuff that they had it's gonna be easier to find players creations and of

2479
02:18:48,860 --> 02:18:53,080
course the they're gonna have a different interface now no longer we have to search

2480
02:18:53,080 --> 02:18:59,240
cross-planets to find different levels and the ability to actually bring them up a list

2481
02:18:59,240 --> 02:19:06,920
also different like metrics like genres keywords etcetera and they're also saying that they're

2482
02:19:06,920 --> 02:19:13,220
gonna be apparently there's gonna be some functions I guess by the little big planet

2483
02:19:13,220 --> 02:19:19,120
dot me I guess the web portal where you're able to give players their own personal websites

2484
02:19:19,120 --> 02:19:24,540
which automatically update with their creations and recently played levels and top scores

2485
02:19:24,540 --> 02:19:30,720
so it's kind of like a Facebook for a little big planet type stuff and in it of course

2486
02:19:30,720 --> 02:19:37,860
you can you know see the pages in the browser's games will be automatically queued up next

2487
02:19:37,860 --> 02:19:43,820
time you play your game if you know pick different levels on there also you can just I guess

2488
02:19:43,820 --> 02:19:48,940
print out one of the QR barcodes assigned to each level and you pop it in for your PlayStation

2489
02:19:48,940 --> 02:19:54,240
I and your creations come up that kind of cool if you like made some games or whatever

2490
02:19:54,240 --> 02:19:58,840
put it on your business card but that little barcode on there and then people can scan

2491
02:19:58,840 --> 02:20:08,200
your barcode or your business card level pops up or or Rob think here for a second when

2492
02:20:08,200 --> 02:20:13,160
it be awesome to get little big plan to you make business cards with like say our website

2493
02:20:13,160 --> 02:20:17,780
on it with that barcode and you go when you load that level it has a bunch of information

2494
02:20:17,780 --> 02:20:24,780
about our website the podcast all that stuff in level like a playable business card or

2495
02:20:24,780 --> 02:20:28,220
those shirts we've been talking about doing for seven years you could put on the barcode

2496
02:20:28,220 --> 02:20:34,000
on the shirt and then like or or maybe maybe we need all our pants so that way the barcode

2497
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:40,500
is on the but and it could be here scan my butt and you could play a little big planet

2498
02:20:40,500 --> 02:20:46,600
to the orange on radio experience using your but I think it's a great idea yeah we need

2499
02:20:46,600 --> 02:20:50,860
all our pants are started do they do they do they let you make your own pants with logos

2500
02:20:50,860 --> 02:20:58,020
on the but it would be hard there's got to be a way to do it I don't scream I mean who

2501
02:20:58,020 --> 02:21:02,960
cares about shirts when you can have all our with a barcode but could do that you can do

2502
02:21:02,960 --> 02:21:07,240
like I think on those like cafe press and stuff like that you can do like boxers and

2503
02:21:07,240 --> 02:21:14,360
stuff well our underwear with the barcode on your body too hard to design a transfer

2504
02:21:14,360 --> 02:21:20,700
it really wouldn't that's an even better idea I want to play the ULR level pull down your

2505
02:21:20,700 --> 02:21:39,700
pants oh this is just wrong I'll show you my little big planet that's what you say on

2506
02:21:39,700 --> 02:21:48,840
the back it would say little big planet and on the front it would just say big planet

2507
02:21:48,840 --> 02:21:58,620
with two moons that orbit it all right I'm in the room with children tonight's show is

2508
02:21:58,620 --> 02:22:03,460
like a little girl tonight's show has been way too serious e3 is serious business we

2509
02:22:03,460 --> 02:22:08,940
needed some barcodes on your ass to to break the tension a little bit that's just you 100

2510
02:22:08,940 --> 02:22:13,920
and that asks will that barcode make it easier to friend your but maybe that's what Nintendo

2511
02:22:13,920 --> 02:22:21,220
print plans to have a repeat of the of the senior video maybe after the show I know maybe

2512
02:22:21,220 --> 02:22:26,540
later we'll do that maybe later all right but we got a serious business guy's e3 is

2513
02:22:26,540 --> 02:22:31,700
serious serious business you know laughing at it oh yeah you have you mentioned that

2514
02:22:31,700 --> 02:22:35,900
you know he's all fuck clothes I want a well our tattoo I actually saw the other day when

2515
02:22:35,900 --> 02:22:41,580
I was searching for stuff to do the stencils for the baby's room they do have things you

2516
02:22:41,580 --> 02:22:48,820
can get where you can print your own temporary tattoos that could happen I know our temporary

2517
02:22:48,820 --> 02:22:54,680
tattoo yes that's that's about what the giveaways were at e3 this year by the way I know people

2518
02:22:54,680 --> 02:23:00,180
think you walk out of e3 with bags and bags of crap and them giving away 360 the one press

2519
02:23:00,180 --> 02:23:03,860
cameras yeah it used to be that way but now in this economy like you're lucky if you get

2520
02:23:03,860 --> 02:23:09,540
a temporary tattoo my boss brought me a Tron evolution t-shirt that has a the disc on the

2521
02:23:09,540 --> 02:23:14,980
back and then also get that and also I got a paratig t-shirt I fucking play Tron I didn't

2525
02:23:32,920 --> 02:23:39,220
figure set mm-hmm I got those for Dan somewhere in this house amongst all this crap Black

2526
02:23:39,220 --> 02:23:43,860
Wolf saying he got the Tron shirt too what the hell is this here I am talking nice about

2527
02:23:43,860 --> 02:23:47,580
Tron and everything I ain't get no shirt oh well it's all right people need to send me

2528
02:23:47,580 --> 02:23:55,500
a Tron shirt hmm I'm the biggest Tron fan in this room all right oh and Black Wolf is

2529
02:23:55,500 --> 02:24:02,280
mad now he didn't get a rock band 3 shirt good we're even all right we are officially

2530
02:24:02,280 --> 02:24:07,180
even all right one more story for you guys then we're gonna take some calls at 877 game

2531
02:24:07,180 --> 02:24:11,540
olr or our username on skype is orange lounge radio and that is a new controller coming

2532
02:24:11,540 --> 02:24:17,060
out for the PlayStation 3 that was being shown at e3 it was from a hori and they are marketing

2533
02:24:17,060 --> 02:24:23,100
a ps3 MMO controller I'm assuming this is for Final Fantasy 14 and possibly DC Universe

2534
02:24:23,100 --> 02:24:26,660
and it is a strange looking device I mean yes it's a keyboard but there's all these

2535
02:24:26,660 --> 02:24:31,840
weird looking buttons on the side of it and most interestingly a device that you can pick

2536
02:24:31,840 --> 02:24:37,500
up with like one hand so you can like play your MMO and control it with one hand and

2537
02:24:37,500 --> 02:24:41,300
then type with the other or whatever else you want to do with well hey the way it looks

2538
02:24:41,300 --> 02:24:44,500
like what it looks like no well what it look yeah I mean that's it's basically I don't

2539
02:24:44,500 --> 02:24:48,160
think you can pick that up it's just meant to like rest your hand on it but basically

2540
02:24:48,160 --> 02:24:52,580
they have it so that you know one analog stick it looks like and then a couple button I'm

2541
02:24:52,580 --> 02:24:56,760
assuming those buttons are for the triggers are on one side and then the other side has

2542
02:24:56,760 --> 02:25:01,460
the other analog stick and then it also has the four face buttons and I think the two

2543
02:25:01,460 --> 02:25:05,340
trigger buttons as well you know it kind of reminds me of remember how they have that

2544
02:25:05,340 --> 02:25:14,900
keyboard for Fantasy Star I think on the GameCube or something like that yes it's like that

2545
02:25:14,900 --> 02:25:19,940
but honestly though just buy a USB keyboard you don't need this fancy piece of shit Toa

2546
02:25:19,940 --> 02:25:23,860
Gak wants to know the time to penis for this controller because it does you know it does

2547
02:25:23,860 --> 02:25:28,560
have a little curvature there where the looks like you would grab that little controller

2548
02:25:28,560 --> 02:25:34,380
thing I'd expect to be longer than say the other relaxed type thing just because it's

2549
02:25:34,380 --> 02:25:38,780
not obvious to put your penis in there and it'll probably come out in Japan first and

2550
02:25:38,780 --> 02:25:43,860
they're not as disgusting as we are here in America so I would say it's gonna be at least

2551
02:25:43,860 --> 02:25:52,380
a few days I think they're not I guess that's true I get let me say it's not as is all over

2552
02:25:52,380 --> 02:26:02,220
the internet with vending machines about the vending machines and and moe lap pillows you

2553
02:26:02,220 --> 02:26:06,660
think this is the country that's ooga-booga that's the country you know what though that

2554
02:26:06,660 --> 02:26:11,100
brought us the Hello Kitty vibrator hold on hold on because they're not so repressed by

2555
02:26:11,100 --> 02:26:15,500
having all of that there's no need to put your penis on an MMO controller that's because

2556
02:26:15,500 --> 02:26:19,060
you have all these other but here in America where everybody's sheltered everybody gets

2557
02:26:19,060 --> 02:26:33,900
freaky deaky behind closed doors the pecan all right what yeah whatever see see Bobby

2558
02:26:33,900 --> 02:26:38,580
agree I think I'm on to something though with the fact that we don't notice it as much because

2559
02:26:38,580 --> 02:26:43,220
they're not as repressed as we are over here oh shoot yeah the same the same country that

2560
02:26:43,220 --> 02:26:50,100
gave us love blue girl I guess that's true too but still they're not tentacle porn Rob

2561
02:26:50,100 --> 02:26:53,380
tentacle you're not hearing about them putting their dicks in things it's just that they

2562
02:26:53,380 --> 02:26:59,880
marry inanimate objects how long is Japan anyway actually I was I was listening to a podcast

2563
02:26:59,880 --> 02:27:05,000
just recently called stuff mom never told you oh it's by the people that did stuff you

2564
02:27:05,000 --> 02:27:11,940
missed in history class yeah those are the podcasts I listen to hello but they were talking

2565
02:27:11,940 --> 02:27:17,380
about how there actually is an epidemic sort of going around now in Japan where men are

2566
02:27:17,380 --> 02:27:24,820
sort of withdrawing from dating and it's not that you know it's just that they're not interested

2567
02:27:24,820 --> 02:27:30,220
in sex at all that's why they have the guy married his lap pillow and the guy married

2568
02:27:30,220 --> 02:27:36,660
his video game and all of this and they're actually looking at it affecting birth rates

2569
02:27:36,660 --> 02:27:41,400
in the future tiger Connor Tarrant says don't be surprised when people start taking photos

2570
02:27:41,400 --> 02:27:47,220
of their 3d penis on the 3ds I thought that exactly and actually I hope there's ways you

2571
02:27:47,220 --> 02:27:52,460
can share pictures online somehow that that is one really cool which is the worst possible

2572
02:27:52,460 --> 02:27:56,280
comment to follow what tiger class said but I was thinking about it for other purposes

2573
02:27:56,280 --> 02:28:00,380
thank you that is one cool thing though that they did have on the 3ds I think would be

2574
02:28:00,380 --> 02:28:05,620
kind of neat to play around with I'm also wondering though with everything being based

2575
02:28:05,620 --> 02:28:10,460
off like you know camera technology how long before we see a YouTube video or something

2576
02:28:10,460 --> 02:28:19,220
like that some chick or whatever playing scantily clad you know god whatever just dance just

2577
02:28:19,220 --> 02:28:26,940
lap dance up skirt cam 3d or you know dance central pole dance central yeah black woven

2578
02:28:26,940 --> 02:28:33,120
chat says sky is thinking about craigslist 3d penis postings wave of the future folks

2579
02:28:33,120 --> 02:28:37,240
wave of the future I don't want to see that wave of the future I had to I had to share

2580
02:28:37,240 --> 02:28:43,580
the image with our chat room of of the poster for love so what you're suggesting is that

2581
02:28:43,580 --> 02:28:51,140
it's chat roulette 3d oh god I don't what do you think is worse on the internet craigslist

2582
02:28:51,140 --> 02:28:58,340
or chat roulette chat roulette even though you got robbed of a several hundred dollar

2583
02:28:58,340 --> 02:29:03,700
machine on craigslist you still think chat roulette is worse probably I've never been

2584
02:29:03,700 --> 02:29:13,940
on chat roulette so I can only imagine though nice we should we should do olr on chat roulette

2590
02:29:50,620 --> 02:29:54,820
maybe a podcast with some of the video game people just playing on chat roulette it'd

2591
02:29:54,820 --> 02:30:00,900
be fun although the joke would probably get old real quick 1877 game olr or our username

2595
02:30:14,360 --> 02:30:20,060
Loki you got any last minute stories for us yes let's talk about the summer of arcade

2596
02:30:20,060 --> 02:30:24,140
coming out of course this summer they've announced the lineup for summer of arcade including

2597
02:30:24,140 --> 02:30:29,060
castlevania harmony of despair hydro thunder hurricane lorecroft and the guardian of light

800 microsoft points or ten dollars so ten dollars ten dollars yes let's go to the phones

2600
02:30:43,120 --> 02:30:49,240
hi you're on orange launch radio who's this uh legend azaku well hey legend azaku what's

2601
02:30:49,240 --> 02:30:59,100
on your mind uh just here on my bed with my mac um let's see um all that post e3 stuff

2602
02:30:59,100 --> 02:31:05,380
that you're still trying to digest i suppose and you too that event for me was basically

2603
02:31:05,380 --> 02:31:10,860
seeing the gran turismo 5 trailer ah that was completely missed by us here at olr that's

2604
02:31:10,860 --> 02:31:16,580
right finally a freaking date for uh gran turismo 5 just play dancing games i'm a big

2605
02:31:16,580 --> 02:31:22,340
i'm a big sucker for those like racing racing simulator games if you're a fan of racing

2606
02:31:22,340 --> 02:31:28,660
games let me tell you this on the 3ds there was a demo on the floor for ridge racer it

2607
02:31:28,660 --> 02:31:36,020
looked great but it played like garbage so i really hope this was just like a concept

2608
02:31:36,020 --> 02:31:40,660
demo and that uh the real thing is fixed because when you run into a wall it's like not even

2609
02:31:40,660 --> 02:31:45,980
realistic your car will turn like 45 degrees when you run into a wall it's crazy uh was

2610
02:31:45,980 --> 02:31:51,740
it the psp ridge racer games i can't imagine it'd be too hard to port that stuff over but

2611
02:31:51,740 --> 02:31:55,860
uh mario kart uh that concept video looked great but i know that's not like realistic

2612
02:31:55,860 --> 02:32:00,900
racing but i just thought i'd throw that in there i mean when i actually saw the trailer

2613
02:32:00,900 --> 02:32:06,380
i couldn't i couldn't imagine how detailed how much effort was put into actually making

2614
02:32:06,380 --> 02:32:12,500
it look almost realistic hence the reason for the number of delays so at least at least

2615
02:32:12,500 --> 02:32:18,660
in this at least in this video game generation duke nukem forever kind of got lost whereas

2616
02:32:18,660 --> 02:32:25,900
um well in other words gt5 managed to beat duke nukem forever and like vaporware that

2617
02:32:25,900 --> 02:32:30,420
never actually became vaporware but it's gonna happen it's gonna happen hey duke nukem at

2618
02:32:30,420 --> 02:32:33,580
least has the manhattan game for whatever it's worth let me ask you this zach goes and

2619
02:32:33,580 --> 02:32:36,820
share a racing game fan need to kind of bring up what happened at the press conferences

2620
02:32:36,820 --> 02:32:42,980
what did you think of microsoft showing off forza with no wheel is that interesting to

2621
02:32:42,980 --> 02:32:48,100
you or are you just kind of like gimmick gimmick this is like i need a wheel i need a physical

2622
02:32:48,100 --> 02:32:55,500
wheel to grab onto something tangible not not some micky mouse pretend wheel if i want

2623
02:32:55,500 --> 02:33:00,140
to do that i could just do that right now by just moving my my hands at ten and two

2624
02:33:00,140 --> 02:33:04,800
in the air oh you're probably pissed about mad cats having to discontinue that wheel

2625
02:33:04,800 --> 02:33:12,780
huh no i want my i want like a logic technique or something and mad cats is taking over production

2626
02:33:12,780 --> 02:33:18,900
of that wheel they're not just microsoft is continuing mad cats i thought i took it away

2627
02:33:18,900 --> 02:33:22,820
from the story that it just wasn't happening period no because i thought that they they

2628
02:33:22,820 --> 02:33:26,020
even had a picture of the mad cats one that looked exactly like the other one unless i

2629
02:33:26,020 --> 02:33:30,100
was photoshopped which it could have been um i was gonna say what'd be kind of cool

2630
02:33:30,100 --> 02:33:36,060
is with these you know new camera peripherals and whatever that have something that incorporates

2631
02:33:36,060 --> 02:33:40,460
where you actually play the game say with like a controller and then you can make a

2632
02:33:40,460 --> 02:33:46,900
gesture or something like that to do something shift up and down break but then you need

2633
02:33:46,900 --> 02:33:53,540
enough space to actually get you need no surface area to actually get the actual the you know

2634
02:33:53,540 --> 02:33:58,700
the person to actually get their image in there and for the camera to do its logic to

2635
02:33:58,700 --> 02:34:03,020
detect moves or not even necessarily anything that has to do with shifting but like you

2636
02:34:03,020 --> 02:34:07,260
know perspective change or something like that so you can like do a little bit i mean

2637
02:34:07,260 --> 02:34:11,740
head tracking they already said and sony already said that it's going to be supported for grants

2638
02:34:11,740 --> 02:34:18,620
original five via the camera it's just that i you know i guess head tracking would make

2639
02:34:18,620 --> 02:34:25,260
would you know make sense if you actually had like a vr headset not just through like

2640
02:34:25,260 --> 02:34:30,780
a tv like i it wouldn't it wouldn't feel right if i'm just tilting my head one way i couldn't

2641
02:34:30,780 --> 02:34:37,500
even see that that angle if it was trying to do that sort of head tracking unless i

2642
02:34:37,500 --> 02:34:42,740
actually saw it in front of me all right well zaku i want to change the topic one more time

2643
02:34:42,740 --> 02:34:46,680
here before we let you go because i i know you you've been a long time listener of the

2644
02:34:46,680 --> 02:34:50,920
show and you you know you know a lot about music games surely you have an opinion on

2645
02:34:50,920 --> 02:34:58,540
dance masters yeah um you mean that new konami game for the connect right yes yeah i actually

2646
02:34:58,540 --> 02:35:04,060
read the interview on bamani style with nayoki and he's basically trying to you know he's

2647
02:35:04,060 --> 02:35:10,820
trying to pitch that game trying to like because you know i mean it's gonna be it's gonna be

2648
02:35:10,820 --> 02:35:16,540
a tough battle between what harmonix is is dishing out because i think if anything konami's

2649
02:35:16,540 --> 02:35:21,860
pretty much missed the boat on some of these major events in the past 10 years of where

2650
02:35:21,860 --> 02:35:27,140
they could have capitalized on on this whole you know on the whole rhythm gaming genre

2651
02:35:27,140 --> 02:35:33,900
in this country and their failure to do it resulted in the prominence and rise of folks

2652
02:35:33,900 --> 02:35:40,220
like that you know like like activision like harmonix and they missed the boat on so many

2653
02:35:40,220 --> 02:35:45,020
occasions not i can't i don't really think i could take them seriously but that's not

2654
02:35:45,020 --> 02:35:51,540
to say that i'm gonna like shun this game completely i know i know with the connect

2655
02:35:51,540 --> 02:35:58,860
you know the new motion the new motion control scheme it kind of replaces the pads from from

2656
02:35:58,860 --> 02:36:03,660
that perspective you won't you don't have to worry about buying a dedicated like peripheral

2657
02:36:03,660 --> 02:36:09,900
just for that game if the camera could actually see the camera could actually see your whole

2658
02:36:09,900 --> 02:36:16,340
body and detect and accurately detect all the movements then that could definitely go

2659
02:36:16,340 --> 02:36:23,260
far not only just on the 360 or the consoles but think about a possible arcade application

2660
02:36:23,260 --> 02:36:27,700
yeah be interesting it came in the arcade i gotta say too zacku having played it it

2661
02:36:27,700 --> 02:36:33,100
it it reads really well i mean it's a scary accurate little thing however keep in mind

2662
02:36:33,100 --> 02:36:37,020
we were at e3 where everything's in a very nicely controlled environment so i'm really

2663
02:36:37,020 --> 02:36:40,540
curious to see if that continues right i mean yeah that's that's the thing with connect

2664
02:36:40,540 --> 02:36:46,460
it hasn't been like i don't think it's been extensively um field tested that to the point

2665
02:36:46,460 --> 02:36:52,720
where right it's still it hasn't been released yet but it's like a really it's close to like

2666
02:36:52,720 --> 02:36:57,160
release candidate status anyways it's like late beta yeah if microsoft really really

2667
02:36:57,160 --> 02:37:00,760
wanted to impress me those rooms the little bubbles that they were showing connect in

2668
02:37:00,760 --> 02:37:04,820
on the show floor instead of being bright light rooms would it look like actual people's

2669
02:37:04,820 --> 02:37:09,700
living rooms but maybe they weren't last year when i thought you know what i i mean last

2670
02:37:09,700 --> 02:37:15,220
year when i actually saw when i actually heard of project natal i didn't realize that i actually

2671
02:37:15,220 --> 02:37:19,080
didn't take them that seriously just because they were doing something that nintendo's

2672
02:37:19,080 --> 02:37:25,620
already done and sony to an extent with the with the ps with the i-20 back in the playstation

2673
02:37:25,620 --> 02:37:33,740
date and and then one year later we see how far how advanced this camera is and it's pretty

2674
02:37:33,740 --> 02:37:39,420
much it's pretty much something in its own that could stand on its own because it's that

2675
02:37:39,420 --> 02:37:45,160
it's not just any maybe you know it's not just any old mickey mouse camera that tries

2676
02:37:45,160 --> 02:37:53,740
to detect you know a 2d image of that of that actor it actually goes it actually has another

2677
02:37:53,740 --> 02:37:59,460
dimension to it so if it has if it's that accurate in turn you know with that type of

2678
02:37:59,460 --> 02:38:05,560
detection that could really go that could really push microsoft foreign in this whole

2679
02:38:05,560 --> 02:38:09,580
new genre that they're trying to dish out all right well uh zack we gotta let you go

02:39:19,460 --> 02:39:25,500
3 and sorcery which looks really terrible you didn't like the sorcery demo that looks

2694
02:39:25,500 --> 02:39:31,700
stupid all right let's go to the phones hi you're on orange lounge radio who's this hey

2695
02:39:31,700 --> 02:39:39,060
it's sturlock hey sturlock what's on your mind uh not much i was uh just wanted to give

2696
02:39:39,060 --> 02:39:46,780
my thoughts and impressions about uh e3 yeah please do what you think um i was pretty impressed

2697
02:39:46,780 --> 02:39:54,420
um i'm actually you probably wouldn't uh expect me to say this but uh i'm actually looking

2698
02:39:54,420 --> 02:40:00,500
forward to the 3ds now of course for for listeners that may not know why that's a surprise because

2699
02:40:00,500 --> 02:40:05,540
they're new to orange lounge radio why would that be a surprise to people uh because i'm

2700
02:40:05,540 --> 02:40:11,620
uh totally blind so you know the three the 3d aspect of it is kind of meaningless to

2701
02:40:11,620 --> 02:40:21,060
me but uh the reason i'm looking forward to it is because uh apparently um there's gonna

2702
02:40:21,060 --> 02:40:30,000
be a much higher you know uh capacity um for like you know data storage so i'm looking

2703
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:36,340
forward to uh how the audio is gonna improve especially and with the really impressive

2704
02:40:36,340 --> 02:40:42,860
lineup of games i'm uh i'm really looking forward to it absolutely i mean certainly

2705
02:40:42,860 --> 02:40:50,100
the games are part of what wins me over as well you know as as neato and starfox 64 ocarina

2706
02:40:50,100 --> 02:40:56,780
time uh paper mario i don't know super street fighter 4 i'm really looking forward to that

2707
02:40:56,780 --> 02:41:00,860
you know it's how they do that no it's really sad that they did not have a demo for or even

2708
02:41:00,860 --> 02:41:08,500
in development a new f-zero game with 3d yeah i know and i'm surprised with everything else

2709
02:41:08,500 --> 02:41:16,700
that was announced maybe i immediately you know thought of you when that was announced

2710
02:41:16,700 --> 02:41:25,400
funny enough i think a lot of listeners did so and uh also um i don't know if you guys

2711
02:41:25,400 --> 02:41:33,300
got to see it but um the new mortal kombat looks just freaking insane you know sadly

2712
02:41:33,300 --> 02:41:38,200
there was a huge line just to get in and see it although apparently it was playable in

2713
02:41:38,200 --> 02:41:41,660
that little room that they were showing um and unfortunately we didn't get in there it

2714
02:41:41,660 --> 02:41:46,380
was just a matter of prioritizing as much of a fan as mortal kombat as i am there was

2715
02:41:46,380 --> 02:41:51,780
this other stuff i wanted to see more um it was getting a lot of very positive buzz though

2716
02:41:51,780 --> 02:41:55,380
from the people that saw it it sounds like the franchise is going back in the right direction

2717
02:41:55,380 --> 02:42:04,300
which thank you which thank god it's what it needed um and yeah i think i think that

2718
02:42:04,300 --> 02:42:09,100
trailer is all you really need of dc universe i was not too impressed with the last few

2719
02:42:09,100 --> 02:42:19,660
games um especially with that stupid story mode slash rpg element that was in a lot of

2720
02:42:19,660 --> 02:42:25,360
them yeah i didn't care then they tried to do the puzzle combat and it just it just spread

2721
02:42:25,360 --> 02:42:30,740
itself combat i think and uh was it motor combat they were trying to be like mario kart

2722
02:42:30,740 --> 02:42:35,140
oh yeah remember when a mortal kombat game just randomly had the mario kart mode in it

2723
02:42:35,140 --> 02:42:39,220
like what the hell was that was more for like just being funny i mean that was the whole

2724
02:42:39,220 --> 02:42:48,500
point it's like huh like we're funny you know um yeah i still sucked well sturlock was there

2725
02:42:48,500 --> 02:42:56,100
anything else out of e3 that really made you excited besides just the 3ds um not really

2726
02:42:56,100 --> 02:43:04,260
i thought the move looked kind of stupid it seemed like okay the it's kind of like what

2727
02:43:04,260 --> 02:43:09,060
you guys thought it's basically the weeb but with better graphics i think when you put

2728
02:43:09,060 --> 02:43:15,080
these new things side by side the move and the um ds or 3ds the reason why you know loki

2729
02:43:15,080 --> 02:43:18,940
just read off the big list of games that are coming to the move and i'm kind of just going

2730
02:43:18,940 --> 02:43:24,100
eh either i already played it with a controller or i can play it with a controller or i'm

2731
02:43:24,100 --> 02:43:27,900
just not really interested in dropping the money just to play it with a move that's oh

2732
02:43:27,900 --> 02:43:33,580
i am kind of i am kind of looking forward to connect though with um seeing how the like

2733
02:43:33,580 --> 02:43:39,620
the voice commands work i'm really curious because you know voice recognition kind of

2734
02:43:39,620 --> 02:43:47,220
has this reputation of being a little iffy so i'm really curious how that's gonna like

2735
02:43:47,220 --> 02:43:51,340
handle me too because that's not something they were really showing off at e3 again i

2736
02:43:51,340 --> 02:43:54,300
think they might have been a little nervous about that technology they mentioned it a

2737
02:43:54,300 --> 02:44:01,420
little bit um and i guess what you do is you just say you know xbox play or whatever but

2738
02:44:01,420 --> 02:44:05,020
yeah they didn't show it off very extensively i think that their technology's gotten a lot

2739
02:44:05,020 --> 02:44:09,740
better and obviously you know with sync and everything they have that technology kind

2740
02:44:09,740 --> 02:44:14,660
of down i mean they have something developed in place for it so they're not going to release

2741
02:44:14,660 --> 02:44:21,420
it you know without it working correctly yeah right hopefully well sterlock we gotta let

2742
02:44:21,420 --> 02:44:24,860
you go to take more calls but thanks so much for your phone call and we'll talk to you

2743
02:44:24,860 --> 02:44:31,100
again soon in a future week okay all right all right later see uh quick question from

2744
02:44:31,100 --> 02:44:36,300
message 100 matt why is it that when nintendo ports gamecube to the wii wii poo poo it but

2745
02:44:36,300 --> 02:44:43,020
when the 3ds ports a lot of n64 games we praise them that's a good question i i don't i actually

2746
02:44:43,020 --> 02:44:47,860
think all the porting makes me nervous i don't really praise it in fact i think okra in time

2747
02:44:47,860 --> 02:44:53,940
once again overrated damn game um i could care less that it's on there starfox 64 was

2748
02:44:53,940 --> 02:44:59,460
kind of fun but yeah i don't want to see a bunch of old 64 games just being ported over

2749
02:44:59,460 --> 02:45:03,940
because they can it's neat to see these things in 3d for the first time i'll give you that

2750
02:45:03,940 --> 02:45:07,660
but is it 30 neat or however much they're going to charge for the games you know they're

2751
02:45:07,660 --> 02:45:12,100
going to be more expensive than a regular ds game this is going to be an excuse to jack

2752
02:45:12,100 --> 02:45:18,300
up the price 510 bucks you know that right you know that hi you're on orange lounge radio

2753
02:45:18,300 --> 02:45:28,980
who's this who's dt hey dt what's on your mind buddy uh you know watching the e3 coverage

2754
02:45:28,980 --> 02:45:37,340
all week mm-hmm how was e3 from the comfort of your living room oh still pretty good you

2755
02:45:37,340 --> 02:45:41,660
know what sometimes i think that's that's the way to do it because a lot of those people

2756
02:45:41,660 --> 02:45:46,320
can get into places that i sure couldn't out there on the show floor so uh there's anything

2757
02:45:46,320 --> 02:45:51,200
wrong with uh staying tuned to the tv at home what caught your uh eyes and ears at e3 this

2758
02:45:51,200 --> 02:46:01,460
year oh everything nintendo had pretty surprising yeah the 3ds was definitely something to behold

2759
02:46:01,460 --> 02:46:05,260
not just that though i mean i know we keep talking 3ds 3ds but they really did have an

2760
02:46:05,260 --> 02:46:10,660
impressive we line up i have not plugged in my we in about six months and now i'm like

2761
02:46:10,660 --> 02:46:15,740
oh god metroid other m and goldeneye and the kirby game looks pretty good i'm gonna have

2762
02:46:15,740 --> 02:46:24,220
to dust off that thing and uh get it in there oh yeah so all those first party games coming

2763
02:46:24,220 --> 02:46:30,660
mm-hmm yeah lots and lots of stuff what'd you think of a connect and move well i thought

2764
02:46:30,660 --> 02:46:37,060
that was cool i'd you know we pretty much called it as far as the uh dance masters goes

2765
02:46:37,060 --> 02:46:41,460
isn't that that's the first thing we said was they should have like a paratype game

2766
02:46:41,460 --> 02:46:46,820
for connect i'm not sure if i said it but i think someone here did and uh yeah they

2767
02:46:46,820 --> 02:46:50,900
got it right you guys uh hit the nail on the head where as i said yeah right you're never

2768
02:46:50,900 --> 02:46:55,540
gonna get a paratype game in the us and and here it is this is but but i think we can

2769
02:46:55,540 --> 02:47:02,540
all agree this is as close as you're ever gonna get if dance masters is not enough for

2770
02:47:02,540 --> 02:47:06,980
you have a night of fire in it with the actual para dance from back in the day i don't think

2771
02:47:06,980 --> 02:47:12,300
there's really gonna be anything that's gonna make you happy at all you know what's really

2772
02:47:12,300 --> 02:47:17,260
funny is that was actually one of my future uh my career view articles was gonna be about

2773
02:47:17,260 --> 02:47:21,980
all those motion controlled dancing games like para para and dance maniacs and all of

2774
02:47:21,980 --> 02:47:26,980
that well you're you're gonna have to get those up sooner rather than later now because

2775
02:47:26,980 --> 02:47:30,900
everyone's gonna have to uh be curious about that by the way speaking of dance maniacs

2776
02:47:30,900 --> 02:47:35,400
uh at arcade infinity they still had a working dance maniacs machine can you believe it after

2777
02:47:35,400 --> 02:47:42,260
all these years i was just watching some videos of it randomly you know what their most popular

2778
02:47:42,260 --> 02:47:48,740
video game was though at arcade infinity they had super street fighter four rigged up to

2779
02:47:48,740 --> 02:47:53,680
a little one of those japanese sit down and play cabinets and it just said one token donation

2780
02:47:53,680 --> 02:47:58,020
please and so you can actually play using the japanese cabinet and the controller and

2781
02:47:58,020 --> 02:48:01,420
everything but since it was just running off a console they couldn't really charge people

2782
02:48:01,420 --> 02:48:05,620
for it but they asked people to please make a token donation it had the longest line of

2783
02:48:05,620 --> 02:48:12,700
anything there i saw crazy oh wow people want to have that arcade experience that oh yeah

2784
02:48:12,700 --> 02:48:17,340
xbox it's not that hard to set up yeah it's very interesting that that was uh the most

2785
02:48:17,340 --> 02:48:21,300
popular thing though probably the only other thing that really had a line was uh maybe

2786
02:48:21,300 --> 02:48:28,020
either 2dx serious or uh dj max technica i was like hold notes what are these hold notes

2787

02:49:43,100 --> 02:49:48,260
3 dual shock controller instead of the moves navigation controller this is a navigation

2803
02:49:48,260 --> 02:49:54,020
controller costs thirty dollars by itself seriously thirty dollars eighty dollars per

2804
02:49:54,020 --> 02:50:01,460
controller if you add the two together um this is interesting bobby kotak evil guy that

2805
02:50:01,460 --> 02:50:06,420
works for activision of course you know he says whose idea it probably was to not have

2806
02:50:06,420 --> 02:50:14,040
a booth and instead have that party he says um that he wishes that call of duty uh was

2807
02:50:14,040 --> 02:50:18,980
a subscription service he says i would have call of duty be an online subscription um

2808
02:50:18,980 --> 02:50:24,340
service tomorrow when you think about uh the audience's interests and how you could really

2809
02:50:24,340 --> 02:50:28,860
satisfy a bigger audience with more inspired creative opportunities i would love to see

2810
02:50:28,860 --> 02:50:35,220
uh or love to see us have an online call of duty world think our players would just um

2811
02:50:35,220 --> 02:50:39,260
have so much of a more compelling experience in other words he thinks that people that

2812
02:50:39,260 --> 02:50:44,820
buy call of duty are suckers and that they're willing to pay um extra money to play online

2813
02:50:44,820 --> 02:50:49,560
with call of duty and to be honest with those 15 dollar map packs that sell like crazy he

2814
02:50:49,560 --> 02:50:58,740
might be right which is really sad uh of course everyone wants to compare you know console

2815
02:50:58,740 --> 02:51:06,940
versus console well now amazon has um different interests um of course that um show on their

2816
02:51:06,940 --> 02:51:16,340
website for preorders whatever for connect and for the move and right now um apparently

2817
02:51:16,340 --> 02:51:22,140
they have uh the connect holds the number one spot on their top selling uh video games

2818
02:51:22,140 --> 02:51:28,820
list with the xbox 360 the new one right behind it and the first mention of the playstation

2819
02:51:28,820 --> 02:51:33,660
move is the navigation controller which is at number 44 in the move starter bundle at

2820
02:51:33,660 --> 02:51:40,880
number 46 so apparently right now there is more interest in the xbox connect let me read

2821
02:51:40,880 --> 02:51:43,540
some comments from our chat room chat dot orange on twitter dot com by the way that's

2822
02:51:43,540 --> 02:51:46,900
very interesting though how they're using amazon as a predictor that's kind of a neat

2823
02:51:46,900 --> 02:51:50,740
way to do it tiger claw says uh oh you guys didn't mention that new mario sports game

2824
02:51:50,740 --> 02:51:54,780
called mario sports mix who's down from some mario dodgeball i think it came up earlier

2825
02:51:54,780 --> 02:51:58,860
in the show i mentioned it i thought it was stupid and i played it and it really yeah

2826
02:51:58,860 --> 02:52:04,340
i played the volleyball game because the the dodgeball wasn't demoable it was cute but

2827
02:52:04,340 --> 02:52:07,940
i think it's more of a kid it's basically mario simple it was too simple yeah it's basically

2828
02:52:07,940 --> 02:52:12,220
mario tennis but they just have a bunch of different sports reskinned and stuff the basketball's

2829
02:52:12,220 --> 02:52:15,100
kind of neat because it's a little bit like that mario three and three basketball game

2830
02:52:15,100 --> 02:52:19,900
they have on the ds but speaking of basketball here's the game i didn't mention nba jam on

2831
02:52:19,900 --> 02:52:25,020
the wii was out there on the show floor looked pretty awesome i gotta say i i'm very i'm

2832
02:52:25,020 --> 02:52:29,820
interested in it i yes i'm interested in a sports game omg uh yyr in our chat room speaking

2833
02:52:29,820 --> 02:52:34,500
on the bobby kotak story you just said says uh bobby kotak to increase our profit margins

2834
02:52:34,500 --> 02:52:38,780
further i would love to personally fuck all of our customers in the ass of course they

2835
02:52:38,780 --> 02:52:43,100
would have to pay me for it first i'm not sure how that increases profit margins might

2836
02:52:43,100 --> 02:52:47,980
increase something there's some pictures that came out um showing the baby uh babysitting

2837
02:52:47,980 --> 02:52:57,820
mama controller which looks like mama's head on a baby i guess it's kind of creepy i want

2838
02:52:57,820 --> 02:53:02,900
to say my babysitting my babysitting mama that could be a song i got distracted i think

2839
02:53:02,900 --> 02:53:06,900
it would have been funnier if the uh baby mama had looked like cooking mama but was

2840
02:53:06,900 --> 02:53:14,540
black i got distracted what by our own wiki why i found the kmart page our wiki is pretty

2841
02:53:14,540 --> 02:53:18,120
awesome if you've never been to the orange lounge radio wiki you can either access it

2842
02:53:18,120 --> 02:53:22,580
at orange lounge radio dot com and then in the little box on the left hand side there's

2843
02:53:22,580 --> 02:53:29,840
a w or just go to orange lounge radio dot wikia w ia.com and there's all this like useless

2844
02:53:29,840 --> 02:53:33,980
information and i mean that in the most positive thankful way to our listeners to put it together

2845
02:53:33,980 --> 02:53:38,140
useless information about our show we need much more of that too did they ever put up

2846
02:53:38,140 --> 02:53:45,220
our um never forget i'm not sure i don't think so i don't know if i saw it you better seek

2847
02:53:45,220 --> 02:53:52,460
that out tiger class says was bionic commando rearm two playable at e3 um not out in the

2849
02:53:59,820 --> 02:54:06,540
revolution x2 the arcade version will be out in japan july 7th it's kind of neat i guess

2850
02:54:06,540 --> 02:54:18,620
maybe we'll see it over here at some point uh and i think that's pretty much it all right

2851
02:54:18,620 --> 02:54:22,740
well before we get to the final thoughts i've got to say this because we've been so dominated

2852
02:54:22,740 --> 02:54:27,060
with e3 news i didn't have a chance to say this earlier in the show so unfortunately

2853
02:54:27,060 --> 02:54:32,340

work ahead of me thank you guys so much for downloading our show and tuning into orange

2861
02:55:10,500 --> 02:55:13,960
lounge radio all we ask and all we've asked for the past eight years if you enjoy our

2862
02:55:13,960 --> 02:55:17,620
show just tell people about the show help us spread the word of the show through word

2863
02:55:17,620 --> 02:55:23,380
of mouth you know retweet and post links on facebook and help uh help us get more fans

2864
02:55:23,380 --> 02:55:26,080
that's all we ask because we don't have a lot of marketing dollars or anything like

2865
02:55:26,080 --> 02:55:31,260
that to pour into this show it would be nice if we had a million dollars but we don't and

2866
02:55:31,260 --> 02:55:34,540
if you do get a million dollars apparently if you are a million dollar operation not

2867
02:55:34,540 --> 02:55:39,300
only do you get invited to the conference but they'll just throw 360s at you who knew
