0	20760	Tonight, June 20th, 2010, we talk about Nintendo going 3D, Microsoft going Kinect, Sony joining
20760	31840	forces with Steam, and more on our E3 wrap-up show, live.
31840	35720	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome to another week of that video
35720	41160	game talk show where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.
41160	45240	Joining you over the next three hours, my name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always,
45240	49120	say hello to the one, the only, Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
49120	50120	Hi.
50120	52760	Hi, how are you, Jamie?
52760	53760	I'm doing better.
53760	57280	You're doing a little better in the voice department, it sounds like, but...
57280	62800	Yeah, but yesterday the wind kicked up and allergies got crazy so my voice was like...
62800	66120	At least you don't sound as terrible as I did on some of those nightly shows from E3
66120	67120	this week.
67120	69800	The Rob Roberts and Pals and Laryngitis is what it really should have been called, it
69800	70800	was pretty bad.
70800	71800	Pals with Laryngitis.
71800	76000	Oh, the smart ass over there is Loki, Tech Master Loki, how are you?
76000	77440	I'm fine.
77440	79520	And did you have a good week?
79520	80520	Not sure.
80520	81520	Yeah?
81520	87520	All right, so obviously the big pink elephant in the room, E3 was this past week and there's
87520	89720	lots and lots of news that we're gonna cover.
89720	93640	We realize a lot of you guys probably watch the press conferences and so forth so we don't
93640	97320	wanna reinvent the wheel here, although we do have some casual people listening to the
97320	98320	show.
98320	100620	We wanna make sure the big stuff is touched on for them.
100620	104680	But also, I do wanna point out, we wanna talk about the stuff that you wanna hear about
104680	105840	live.
105840	109680	So make sure you join us in our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com if you are listening
109680	114400	live on this Sunday night, cuz we do tape live every Sunday night at All Games Radio,
114400	119500	www.allgames.com at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
119500	123480	So we're gonna be taking your questions about E3 and what you think maybe wasn't covered
123480	125400	well enough or maybe has been covered too much.
125400	129820	We're gonna take your Twitter questions, your emails, and all that fun stuff, as we always
129820	131720	do here on that show where every gamer has a voice.
131720	135820	We're gonna start off though, I mean, why change a good formula?
135820	137080	Just because it was E3 week.
137080	140680	We need to talk about the games we've been playing, and what kind of games you played
140680	141680	this week.
141680	143440	So, Dark Soccer, why don't you start us off.
143440	144440	How was your game week?
144440	147240	And by the way, actually, I should say this before you get started.
147240	151480	Dark Soccer and Loki were unable to go to E3 this year due to personal stuff.
151480	152480	Yeah, rub it in.
152480	153480	Well, I'm sorry.
153480	154480	I don't mean to rub it in.
154480	157520	But just, you know, in case the listeners are like, well, they're just gonna talk about
157520	158520	E3 all week.
158520	159520	No, no.
159520	162960	I mean, there was other games to be played besides just the ones at the LA Convention
162960	164120	Center.
164120	170260	I played Star Trek Online, which I was playing when you guys got here.
170260	173360	And I wanted to thank Bobby for going ten minutes over because it gave me time to finish
173360	174720	my mission.
174720	177160	So thank you, Bobby.
177160	179800	I was busy shooting Romulans.
179800	180800	Good times.
180800	184720	What else did I play?
184720	185720	That's really it.
185720	188280	You've just been addicted to Star Trek Online all week?
188280	189280	That's cool.
189280	190280	Yeah, that's what I played.
190280	191760	I really didn't play a whole lot because I started school.
191760	192760	Oh, again?
192760	194760	I thought you just finished.
194760	195760	I'm going in the summer.
195760	196760	Oh, boy.
196760	198080	All right, summer school.
198080	201200	Remember when summer school was just for the kids that flunked during the regular semester?
201200	202440	Now everybody does summer school.
202440	205280	Well, I do have to mention that I told you this earlier.
205280	209880	My teacher – I'm taking U.S. history – my teacher brought up the Oregon Trail.
209880	210880	Nice.
210880	215840	And she said, you remember that game, you know, where you have to stockpile meat and
215840	216840	everything?
216840	217840	We're like, Oregon Trail.
217840	218840	She's like, yeah, that game.
218840	221320	It's like, well, people really did die from all this stuff.
221320	225920	And I told her about your shirt, the one that said, you have died of dysentery.
225920	228280	And she laughed and then looked a little bit sick.
228280	231760	My teacher's also a little preggers.
231760	232820	Oh, I see.
232820	234600	So she carried a couple of pounds back to the wagon?
234600	235600	Yes.
235600	236600	Ah, I see.
236600	239160	You know that game where you're on a trail to Oregon?
239160	240160	What's it called again?
240160	241160	I don't know.
241160	242160	All right.
242160	244280	Loki, how was your gaming week?
244280	245640	I just played Grand Theft Auto.
245640	246640	That's pretty much it.
246640	247640	That's it?
247640	249360	That's all I had time for.
249360	251600	I don't think I played anything else.
251600	253640	Oh, a little bit of Earth Defense Force.
253640	254720	Just getting through that some more.
254720	260420	But mainly just Grand Theft Auto because I had to go lose a game by $2 one day.
260420	264480	So it means I had to take it out on my coworkers by kicking the crap out of them.
264480	268440	It was funny, though, because one of the games actually quadrupled second place's score.
268440	272200	I had $4,000 and the person below me had $1,000.
272200	274400	I kicked the crap out of them.
274400	276600	That was in 15 minutes, too, by the way.
276600	280880	Apparently my boss was bragging to Take Two because they had a meeting with them about
280880	284520	how wonderful I am at Grand Theft Auto, to which I'm sure they didn't care.
284520	289520	Yeah, I was going to say, I don't think Take Two would really be concerned with how good
289520	290520	you are.
290520	293640	He's like, did you know that there's somebody that works with us that's in the top 100 in
293640	294640	the world?
294640	295640	No, really?
295640	299800	Which I was like, okay, whatever.
299800	302560	You were glued to the E3 press conferences all week, though, right?
302560	306800	Yeah, I watched those instead of working because I can do that.
306800	307800	So were we.
307800	311160	We were watching from our hotel room because we don't get invited to fun stuff like that,
311160	312560	but that's okay.
312560	318920	So we got to watch them all from the comfort of our historic hotel room in downtown LA,
318920	321960	not far from where all the rioting was taking place after game seven, but I digress.
321960	327040	What did you think of all the press conferences as you were watching them, Loki?
327040	328040	They were pretty cool.
328040	334960	What was kind of unique, I guess, is no one really kind of failed at press conferences.
334960	335960	There wasn't any...
335960	343360	Nintendo, thank God, did not show anything about the Vitality sensor, which makes me
343360	346040	believe that they're not putting it out anymore.
346040	351320	I think they kept what's-her-name Kami tied up in a burlap bag backstage somewhere.
351320	353560	She was unable to be freed during the press conference.
353560	354560	Hopefully sufficiently beaten.
354560	355560	Aw, poor thing.
355560	358240	She's just trying to do her job.
358240	359240	I don't know.
359240	360240	What do we want to talk about?
360240	361240	Just each press conference?
361240	362240	Or do we want to...
362240	365400	Well, I want to talk about my gaming week because I played about 40 games this week.
365400	366400	So let's get started.
366400	367400	We'll take your time.
367400	368400	All right.
368400	369400	No, no.
369400	370400	I'm not going to repeat.
370400	374040	Oh, I will talk about something because it is gaming related, but not video games.
374040	379060	I've been working on the baby's room some more and doing stuff regarding that.
379060	381560	I'm building a custom mobile.
381560	383800	I've actually done the wiring for it and it works perfectly.
383800	387760	Well, except for yesterday because I broke it, but that was just from trying to show
387760	390880	people and the wire came off, but I can fix that.
390880	395180	Anyway, so I have this thing now where if I flip a switch, an on-off switch, it basically
395180	399760	plays an MP3 lullaby of the Super Mario Brothers theme.
399760	402860	At the same time, it will also spin a motor.
402860	403860	That's pretty awesome.
403860	407720	I'm going to shove it into an acrylic cube that's going to become a question block and
407720	408800	hang stuff from it.
408800	412080	And I've started drawing on the wall.
412080	419080	I posted on Twitter and Facebook the design I have for the room, which is looking like
419080	421200	new Super Mario Brothers.
421200	422200	That sounds so adorable.
422200	423200	I could barf, honestly.
423200	424720	It's going to be awesome.
424720	430280	I'm not going to recap everything I played at the actual E3 show because we had the daily
430280	431280	shows.
431280	434000	I'm sure a lot of them will come up as we go over tonight's news, which is going to
434000	435680	be a little more free for them tonight.
435680	439460	If you guys have questions in chat and during the Twitter topics and calls, if you want
439460	442920	to know if I touched a certain game, I'd be happy to give you my thoughts on it.
442920	447480	But one thing I think we all have to keep in mind about E3, and I sensed us during the
447480	452060	daily shows, sometimes veering off that path a little bit, we're looking at very early
452060	453060	builds of things.
453060	457180	And a lot of times the reason why companies want to have these, make an appointment to
457180	460480	see the game, or you're not going to play it, I'm going to play it for you, and all
460480	465600	this stuff, is because they don't want people to form 100% opinions about games from these
465600	467600	demos on the show floor.
467600	472160	I think it takes a lot of guts to put your game out there on the show floor at E3, guts
472160	476000	that clearly Activision and Blizzard don't have anymore from not having their booths
476000	480280	open to the public at E3.
480280	482320	But didn't they quit E3 last year?
482320	484920	Well, they still had a booth.
484920	488480	Most everything was behind closed doors at that booth, but they've been scaling further
488480	489480	and further back.
489480	490480	But I'm digressing a little bit.
490480	496220	I could go on this whole other tangent about BlizzCon and Blizzard, and how I am a big
496220	501200	stan of World of Warcraft, I love that game, it's amazing, I am not fucking going to BlizzCon
501200	502200	ever.
502200	503200	Ever.
503200	505200	Because it's a joke.
505200	508140	They should have just had a big sign out front of their booth that says, seriously, you've
508140	512600	seen this stuff before, it's just more of the same.
512600	514880	Well anyway, I'm getting off the path a little bit.
514880	518720	Because I actually did play games that weren't just at E3, so I want to get those out of
518720	523420	the way, because I know most of the people listening to this show didn't go to E3, so
523420	527640	you guys are probably playing a lot of standby games to catch up on, just like I was.
527640	531400	So I will mention this, I played, you might remember a couple weeks on the show, I said,
531400	533320	I'm going to beat three games this summer.
533320	536260	And I'm falling a little behind on my goal, but I finally found a game I want to play
536260	541040	to completion after getting about a third of the way through it.
541040	548760	I played Alan Wake, which is a game that was a long time in the making, it was from Microsoft
548760	554560	Game Studios, one of their internal development teams that created the game.
554560	561800	I guess you could say it's Microsoft's answer to Silent Hill, but a little less of the crazy
561800	568580	creatures and things of that sort, and a little more of the strange paranormal sort of stuff.
568580	572980	I really like how immersive the game feels to me, I like a lot of the small touches that
572980	574080	they've done with the game.
574080	579240	There's these little TVs that when you come across them will play little episodes of The
579240	581800	Twilight Zone, or at least kind of their version of that.
581800	587640	I think they call it Night Springs, is what they call it, which Shane pointed out to me,
587640	591280	is because the town name is called Bright Falls, so Night Springs is like the opposite
591280	594400	of that, and I didn't catch that right away, it's funny.
594400	599320	I really love the fog effects, they're very scary, and I think they're done very well.
599320	602480	And I think it's a survival horror game, it's pretty cool, it's immersive, it feels like
602480	608760	you're watching a TV show, and it's been compared to Twin Peaks in other places, and I think
608760	613040	that's a very fair comparison, because you have a lot of those eccentric characters,
613040	620760	strange stories, WTF is going on feeling, and yeah, I'm really liking Alan Wake so far,
620760	622480	it's a good game.
622480	627760	Lots of little things to collect for achievements and so forth, great environments to interact
627760	631440	with, very large environments where you'll be walking down a trail, and then suddenly
631440	636280	you get in a car and drive to the other side of the map, and this is all seamless, where
636280	641200	you maybe started the mission earlier, but everything has changed since you were gone,
641200	645040	but there's no loading in between all of this, so the map is kind of changing dynamically
645040	647200	as you're away, which I think is very cool.
647200	651680	So yeah, I've been really enjoying Alan Wake.
651680	654520	I'm looking forward to seeing some of the download content they're gonna put with that.
654520	657400	So I'll tell you more about the game when I get a little closer to completing, because
657400	662360	some of the reviews I have read about the game online really razzed the ending, but
662360	665440	I don't want to read what the ending is, because I'm really into the story right now, and I'm
665440	669520	trying to find my own theories about what's happening, so when I do beat this game, I
669520	672520	will kind of come back and let you know if I was as disappointed as some of the other
672520	673520	reviewers were.
673520	676920	Well, they also have the episodic content that's coming out port 2, I think, should
676920	677920	be interesting.
677920	681160	Oh yeah, there's at least two coming out, but they have a countdown timer in the game
681160	682680	to when the first one's coming out.
682680	687120	By the way, the game has major product placement, which I found very, very shameless product
687120	693000	placement, like Alan Wake uses a Verizon telephone, the car that he's driving in one scene has
693000	698940	sync by Microsoft in it, and Energizer batteries are what you use in light, which is a very
698940	700160	interesting battle mechanic.
700160	703720	It's not like Silent Hill where you kind of have to run away from everything, you can
703720	708720	do that, but it's very much a kind of light versus dark sort of thing in Alan Wake, and
708720	712240	the goal is you have to burn them down with your flashlight, and then they're vulnerable
712240	716760	to get shot, and you can kind of go through and kill things, but you can use light from
716760	721040	different sources, not just your flashlight, but you can use the headlights on a car, you
721040	724920	could attract the monsters towards a pole that has light shining from it, and it would
724920	725920	burn them down.
725920	726940	It's very interesting.
726940	732480	I'm surprised that Energizer would agree to have their batteries in a game where you have
732480	736120	to keep collecting batteries because they keep running out really fast.
736120	741080	It's like, uh, shouldn't I just collect one Energizer battery and be done with it for
741080	742080	the whole game?
742080	744400	I mean, isn't that the message we're trying to send across?
744400	749080	Well, if you don't burn your batteries by, because you can focus the light energy on
749080	752880	a monster and that burns your batteries real quick, but if you don't do that, you can burn
752880	756800	them down very slowly, although it's tough to dodge in that way, and then your batteries
756800	758520	slowly recharge.
758520	762920	So if you're kind of smart about the way you do it, you don't ever burn through a battery,
762920	767840	because you just burn it down, slowly recharge, burn it down again, recharge, but sometimes
767840	769040	it just becomes too much chaos.
769040	772120	Okay, that's just witchcraft now.
772120	775080	Well, maybe that's the trick, I don't know.
775080	777080	So yeah, Alan Wake, I had a good time with that.
777080	780360	So that's one of the games I've been playing outside of the whole E3 show.
780360	783920	Also we took a trip to Arcade Infinity one of the nights we were there at E3 just to
783920	786360	go, you know, see what's new over there.
786360	787720	What's new over there?
787720	792680	Well, new versions of all the same damn games we've been playing for ten years.
792680	798440	I played Guitar Freaks X, what the hell are they on now, X5 I think?
798440	799440	I don't know.
799440	800440	I just lost count.
800440	801440	Doesn't matter.
801440	805240	It's the same game I played ten years ago, just with new music, so whatever, it was fine.
805240	806240	I played D2Max Technica.
806240	809800	But don't the X games have like the, uh, No way, I didn't play it myself, I watched
809800	810800	Shane play it.
810800	811800	I thought I was playing it in my head.
811800	816680	Were the X games the ones that have like the extra buttons on it, or is that the different
816680	817680	one I'm thinking of?
817680	818680	No, it's just three buttons.
818680	822880	I'm thinking the DX ones or something, or GX, or, I don't know what the hell it's called.
822880	824120	Who cares, it's damn Guitar Freaks.
824120	828120	I played Pop and Music the movie, I don't even know what version of the game that is.
828120	829520	It's like 16 or something.
829520	833840	Whatever, I played that for a little bit, and, you know, playing big buttons.
833840	839280	See Konami, this is the game you can put out 16 versions of, not beat and groovy.
839280	841720	I don't understand why you're getting confused.
841720	845040	How do we make this game again?
845040	847960	And then I played a little bit of DJ Max, because Shane made me, because I was like,
847960	850960	oh, there's actually some songs in Technica I really like, and he's like, really?
850960	854400	You gotta play DJ Max on the PSP, you can play these songs, and he's like, you can do
854400	856680	four buttons and five buttons and six buttons.
856680	860360	So I ended up playing a little bit of that too, and he was strongly encouraging me to
860360	864160	buy DJ Max on the PSP, which I might do, maybe at some point.
864160	865160	There were some songs I liked.
865160	866160	It's not worth it.
866160	867160	Really?
867160	868160	I've tried it on PSP.
868160	870480	You can get it for like, with all the sales going on right now and used and everything,
870480	871480	like ten bucks?
871480	873480	Eh, that might even be worth it then.
873480	874480	So.
874480	875480	Alright.
875480	877560	So that was the games outside of E3 that I played.
877560	880840	I don't know, you guys wanna know, just here in studio, about anything at E3?
880840	884320	Were you curious about any of the stuff, the games there, that you might have heard I got
884320	887920	my hands on?
887920	890160	Marvel vs. Capcom 3, did you try that at all?
890160	891160	I did.
891160	893640	They had about ten characters playable on the show floor.
893640	895120	I got to actually play it twice.
895120	899080	The lines were excruciatingly long at Capcom's booth, but the game was also at Microsoft's
899080	904720	booth and Sony's booth, and so the lines were much shorter at Microsoft's booth.
904720	905720	So I did play it.
905720	910460	I had a team of like, Ryu, Morgan, Felicia in one of them, and I used like Deadpool in
910460	913720	another one, just for Jamie, you know, because I know she'd be happy if I did that.
913720	915700	And I think I used Captain America.
915700	918440	And you know, I'm not super into this series.
918440	924320	I was always more of a Capcom vs. SNK fan, but it played a lot like 2 to me, it just
924320	927160	had more stylistic graphics.
927160	928160	I like the way it looks.
928160	932680	It didn't flip into that 3D as much as I thought it would, like Street Fighter IV does, you
932680	933680	know what I mean?
933680	936440	Like I mean, it's not a 3D game, but you know how Street Fighter IV, like a lot of it has
936440	937440	the 3D elements?
937440	940680	It didn't do that as much as I thought it would, I mean during some of the specials
940680	944560	and so forth, but I think if you're a fan of Marvel vs. Capcom 2, you're not going to
944560	945560	be disappointed.
945560	952320	It's a high def, widescreen, cel-shaded, stylistic game, and I'm sure y'all will be happy.
952320	953320	I am.
953320	954320	Can't wait.
954320	959840	Jamie, now, did you see the extended trailer that they had for Marvel vs. Capcom 3?
959840	963080	The one that included Deadpool vs. Dante?
963080	966600	You had that in there, but did you see where he gets attacked by Morgan or...?
966600	970320	Yeah, see, that's ex- I saw the Iron Man vs. Morgan.
970320	973960	Well, there's an extended trailer that's all those little cutscenes or whatever.
973960	980840	He has one part where he gets attacked by her, she has like those spikes or whatever
980840	984920	that come out, and they hit him in the ass.
984920	986480	Dante looked like a badass character.
986480	990520	Shane was playing as Dante, and he was whooping me, and it took like two of my characters
990520	995440	to bring Dante down, but then I guess Chris is either really hard to use or just stinks
995440	998000	or something, because I took him out like that, and then we were even again.
998000	999000	Probably really hard to use.
999000	1000000	Yeah.
1000000	1005160	What's his face from Dead Rising?
1005160	1006160	Frank West?
1006160	1007160	Yeah, Frank West.
1007160	1009520	He was not in the demo, so I couldn't tell you.
1009520	1013320	But I will say Dead Rising 2, full of lols.
1013320	1018120	I like the Fortune City setting for it, the Vegas is a cool little setting for it.
1018120	1021480	One of the weapons we saw used on zombies was great.
1021480	1026680	It was like this, okay, imagine like an old style lawn mower that you have to do manually,
1026680	1029140	but it's motorized on the bottom instead.
1029140	1032920	So like you could pick this up, and then like he would push it into the zombie and chop
1032920	1033920	him in half.
1033920	1034920	Maybe like a mulcher?
1034920	1035920	Yeah, like a mulcher type of thing.
1035920	1036920	It was awesome.
1036920	1037920	I laughed my ass off.
1037920	1038920	They had that in the first game, sort of.
1038920	1039920	Well, it was different.
1039920	1042200	It was like an actual lawn mower that I remember.
1042200	1046160	I have a feeling Dead Rising 2 is really just kind of more of the same, but it was, we laughed.
1046160	1047160	Who cares?
1047160	1048160	It's a great formula.
1048160	1049160	We laughed and laughed.
1049160	1051200	There's only one thing they needed to do, and that was just fix the save system.
1051200	1052200	That's done.
1052200	1053200	We're good.
1053200	1056880	Look into our chat room at chat.orangelawnsradio.com if you're listening to us live on Sunday
1056880	1057880	night.
1057880	1058880	Why not come join us?
1058880	1062040	We have a question from chat about questions and comments.
1062040	1066640	Tiger Claw says, I like how Deadpool yells, you press the wrong button when he loses in
1066640	1067640	the game.
1067640	1070440	I didn't see that, but it's so loud on the show floor.
1070440	1072400	You can't really hear a lot of the games.
1072400	1076320	I will say, though, one of the soundtracks that sounded like I could hear was the Tron
1076320	1078800	game that they were demoing at the Disney booth.
1078800	1081200	I played the Tron game on PlayStation 3.
1081200	1082840	Okay, here's what it is.
1082840	1088360	Imagine Prince of Persia got totally reskinned with Tron graphics.
1088360	1089680	That's what the fucking Tron game is.
1089680	1093840	See, I thought it was more of like the force unleashed in the Tron universe type thing.
1093840	1094840	I know.
1094840	1095840	It played like Prince of Persia.
1095840	1100800	Like even the demo, you do the wall walking, the big flips, the jumping over objects.
1100800	1102720	It really felt like Prince of Persia to me.
1102720	1104680	But it used the Daft Punk soundtrack.
1104680	1105680	Like I could tell.
1105680	1108040	And so I'm like, oh, this has a sweet soundtrack to it.
1108040	1112840	It was very nice and very stylistic with the disks being thrown and everything going in
1112840	1114120	slow motion.
1114120	1118120	But I think a lot of people, like Shane, never saw Tron, and he's kind of looking at me playing
1118120	1120440	the game and he's going, the graphics in this suck.
1120440	1123120	And I'm like, it's Tron.
1123120	1125720	Their wire frame graphics is what it's supposed to look like.
1125720	1126720	He'll learn.
1126720	1127720	He didn't get it.
1127720	1128720	In due time.
1128720	1129720	I know.
1129720	1130720	He'll get it someday.
1130720	1131720	Let's see.
1131720	1132720	Other questions from chat.
1132720	1134220	Chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
1134220	1140000	Some folks wanting to know, it looks like, who's asked it here?
1140000	1142720	Ray Iannami is saying it's yet another Symphony of the Night remake.
1142720	1144840	I guess they're talking about the Castlevania game.
1144840	1147440	Oh, Tigerclaw is asking, did you play the new Castlevania game?
1147440	1149840	I did.
1149840	1155160	It does use a lot of the same skins from Symphony of the Night and it plays very similar.
1155160	1159960	But yet at the same time, it feels a lot different because it has what I call this Neo Geo effect
1159960	1163080	where it zooms in and out of parts of the castle.
1163080	1164080	Mode 7!
1164080	1165080	Well, you can control that.
1165080	1166440	It's not arbitrary.
1166440	1172000	You control that by clicking the left or the right button, one of them.
1172000	1173840	You would actually control that.
1173840	1176020	But I found it very hard to get through the maze.
1176020	1178120	It was a hard rush for 10 minutes.
1178120	1181280	The problem with the game is that no one was really explaining the game to us and there
1181280	1185560	was no on-screen rules or whatever in the demo so we just kind of had to figure it out.
1185560	1188320	And yeah, it really did feel a lot like Symphony of the Night.
1188320	1191640	But the multiplayer element does seem to add something pretty cool to it.
1191640	1194360	And yes, you can do co-op or competitive.
1194360	1195360	So that's kind of fun.
1195360	1197560	I think it'll be a fun little arcade title.
1197560	1198880	Depends what they charge for it.
1198880	1201120	If they try to charge like 30 bucks for it, no.
1201120	1202120	It's gonna be $15.
1202120	1203120	$15 is fine.
1203120	1204120	Probably.
1204120	1205120	It seems like it'll be a good deal for $15.
1205120	1207320	$15 is a new five.
1207320	1211960	The other Castlevania game, I can tell, was not a Castlevania game when it started.
1211960	1217400	It looked a lot more like God of War or Bayonetta, but it's really pretty.
1217400	1218400	And it's very stylistic.
1218400	1221880	And it has sparkle ponies.
1221880	1225640	And it has Patrick Stewart, excuse me, Sir Patrick Stewart doing some of the voiceover
1225640	1228520	works in little in-between montages.
1228520	1229520	But there was this cool little sequence.
1229520	1231260	I want him to be a playable character.
1231260	1234640	There was this cool little sequence where like you're on a wolf that's kind of riding
1234640	1240380	and you can jump onto the other wolf and throw the guy off and it's, it's, Castlevania meets
1240380	1241380	God of War.
1241380	1246600	But I think if people are expecting like an old school Castlevania game, the arcade game's
1246600	1247600	for you.
1247600	1248600	Not this new one.
1248600	1250400	This new one is a different direction for the series.
1250400	1253320	I wonder if they call that level Operation Wolf.
1253320	1255880	Um, let's see.
1255880	1256880	Other comments.
1256880	1263160	Oh, it looks like some folks are asking about the 3D Castlevania game there as well.
1263160	1264160	Let's see.
1264160	1266320	They're asking about the Tron.
1266320	1268680	Tiger class says, hopefully the multiplayer will kick ass.
1268680	1271540	Like if they have the classic light cycle versus light cycle from the original Tron
1271540	1272560	in 3D.
1272560	1273960	That's the Wii game.
1273960	1277140	The Wii game had a whole little light cycle thing in 3D.
1277140	1278720	That is exactly what the Wii game is.
1278720	1279720	So there you go.
1279720	1281280	Well, no, it's gonna have that also in the other ones.
1281280	1282280	Oh, they were showing that in the demo.
1282280	1283440	They were probably just showing different levels.
1283440	1284440	Yeah.
1284440	1285440	Most likely.
1285440	1286440	Most likely.
1286440	1288840	I could tell the graphical difference though between the Wii and the other ones.
1288840	1292840	Well Tron is supposed to be in 3D also in the PlayStation 3 version.
1292840	1295640	I'm not sure about the 360 though.
1295640	1298920	I will tell you about a couple other games just kind of off the top of my head.
1298920	1301380	There's a few that I want to talk about for sure.
1301380	1303960	A couple of them are music based so bear with me a minute.
1303960	1308240	Rock Band 3 is gonna be a worthy upgrade.
1308240	1312120	They talked very quickly about some of the stylistic changes that they've made to the
1312120	1317480	menus where you really see your band kind of grow up on the main menu.
1317480	1322360	They've talked about how they have a new condensed mode where you can basically do the entire
1322360	1325320	band from start to finish in about four hours worth of gameplay.
1325320	1329400	So it's like an instant rock band party basically if you want to invite people over.
1329400	1334520	And I think most importantly as the rock band library has been growing and so forth, they
1334520	1337560	have put in filters on the song list.
1337560	1342480	And I know a lot of people are wondering this, all of the rock band songs are importable
1342480	1345940	into Rock Band 3 with the exception of the Beatles which I don't think comes as a surprise
1345940	1346940	to anyone.
1346940	1352100	But this Uber machine that they were playing on had Rock Band 2, Lego Rock Band, Green
1352100	1354520	Day Rock Band, I mean everything else was importable.
1354520	1358380	This Uber machine they were playing on had like 1300 songs, it was nuts.
1358380	1360120	I know all about that.
1360120	1365320	The realistic mode, I didn't understand it at all on guitar because I don't play the
1365320	1366320	guitar.
1366320	1371760	Guitar seemed really confusing, essentially 120, I mean I'm sure it's just like, yeah
1371760	1372760	I don't know how to play the guitar.
1372760	1377520	I don't know how to play the guitar but watching the guy play that White Stripes song and then
1377520	1381900	they plugged in an amp at the same time, they like doubled, because there's two guitar peripherals.
1381900	1385000	One of them has all the buttons and then the other one's like a real guitar that you can
1385000	1390340	use to play rock band basically in this special mode and I guess they double jacked it into
1390340	1394400	the game and the amp and what they did, they turned down the game volume and turned up
1394400	1397560	the amp and he was playing the White Stripes song, it was like the real song.
1397560	1401480	So I think this will answer a lot of people's calls like, well if you, and especially like
1401480	1406040	music, you know music snobs and people in the bands, Rock Band isn't real guitar playing.
1406040	1410960	It is funny though, like that game Power Gig gets announced way back and everyone's like
1410960	1414240	oh my god you know it's a game that's going to teach you how to play guitar and then Rock
1414240	1419240	Band 3 comes out, oh it's exactly the same thing, ah crap.
1419240	1422520	But I will say one instrument I know a little more about is the keyboards and getting to
1422520	1425320	see the real keyboard mode, I was like whoa cool.
1425320	1428880	I do want to correct one thing I had said, speculated I guess I should say earlier on
1428880	1431960	the show and that is when you're playing in the five bar mode, I think that's what they
1431960	1437520	call it, the five bar mode, which is you know like regular rock band on the keyboard, it
1437520	1442800	is not the color bars that you see at the top of the keyboard, you use right in the
1442800	1447240	middle, you use middle C, D, E, F, G, for those of you guys that know your piano, you're
1447240	1450880	basically using just five keys right next to each other to play five bar mode.
1450880	1454340	You're only going to use the full keyboard if you actually choose to play in pro mode.
1454340	1458640	But I, as a keyboard player many many many many years ago, I was in heaven, I thought
1458640	1459640	it was great.
1459640	1460640	I think it looks awesome.
1460640	1461640	Looks awesome.
1461640	1467760	Dr. 945 in our chat room, chat.orangetongue.com, excuse me, The Dr. 945 says have you guys
1467760	1471240	seen the complete track list wall, that's a lot of songs on rock band, yes it was in
1471240	1474880	their booth, it was right across from where we were playing rock band three, it is very
1474880	1478600	impressive and they also had a bar graph, I don't know if that made it into the pictures
1478600	1482280	as well, that says here's how many they have in rock band, here's how many are in guitar
1482280	1487120	hero, it was a lot less.
1487120	1492000	I really really didn't want to like Dance Central, but I do.
1492000	1497160	The Kinect games, because I kind of, and I'll let Loki kind of cover Microsoft's press conference
1497160	1500800	and some of the highlights and lowlights in a minute, but I think a lot of us walked away
1500800	1505520	from Microsoft's press conference kind of going, oh these Kinect seem like the gimmicky
1505520	1510300	crap we saw on the Wii a couple years ago, but you know what, getting up there and actually
1510300	1515360	playing Dance Central was actually kind of fun and moving back and forth and it wasn't
1515360	1518560	as complicated as I thought it was going to be from first looking at it to follow the
1518560	1523960	guy on the screen, it kind of felt like doing aerobics in a way, and I think that's the
1523960	1526580	Kinect's biggest strength, it's going to be exergaming heaven is what it is.
1526580	1533320	If you've ever taken a dance class, it's basically how they break it down in a dance class, basically
1533320	1540160	like a long time ago in high school I took a street dance class during, it was like sophomore
1540160	1544560	year or something, and it was fun for like a summer, and basically what they do is they
1544560	1549720	teach you small little bits, like different techniques or whatever, and then you string
1549720	1553400	it together in a routine, and that's basically what this game is, they teach you a bunch
1553400	1557640	of small techniques and then you string it together in a routine, which is cool, I think
1557640	1563680	that's, I mean, I'm not sure if I would actually play this a lot because my wife would just
1563680	1569200	not get it, she would just be like, you look like a dumbass, I can see it right now, and
1569200	1574180	it would be kind of fun though, I still may get it anyways, but god no it's not going
1574180	1579880	to ever appear on the internet with me in a video, never ever, unless I get really good
1579880	1584560	at it, in which case, maybe, but even still, no.
1584560	1590040	So I mean that's kind of cool, and the song list looks pretty cool on it, but if we're
1590040	1595240	going to compare it to say Dance Masters, let me put it this way, if you took what you
1595240	1599760	learned from Dance Central and actually went to a club and did it, you might look alright,
1599760	1604040	you took Dance Masters and did what they have in that game, you're going to look like an
1604040	1605040	idiot.
1605040	1609760	Well I don't know if I go that far, because I think it was hard to see, and I wanted to
1609760	1615280	get into Dance Masters, but for me the biggest difference between the two games is, yeah
1615280	1618600	the style of dance was definitely different between the two, but it's the song list, and
1618600	1624300	that's really what it's going to ultimately come down to, and if Dance Masters continues
1624300	1629080	down this path of DDR looking songs, there's going to be a niche audience for it, which
1629080	1633800	is most of the people that have grown up with this show for the past 8 years since we started
1633800	1638880	talking exclusively about DDR, but Dance Central will be the game that sells superior to it
1638880	1640700	in America anyway.
1640700	1643960	I don't think Dance Central is even going to come out in Japan, and I think Dance Masters
1643960	1644960	will rule over there.
1644960	1648980	Here's the thing though about Dance Masters, and actually Dance Central, I'd be more willing
1648980	1653140	to back Dance Central because I know how harmonics is with download content.
1653140	1655520	They will deliver on download content.
1655520	1660360	Konami, they've promised to deliver on download content for every single dance game that's
1660360	1666320	come out, even the Karaoke Revolution games that have come out, never have they actually
1666320	1667320	come through.
1667320	1671400	It's just been, oh we'll put out a couple things to download content, we're done.
1671400	1676640	Oh yeah we promised you all this stuff, but like fuck if they're going to deliver it.
1676640	1680000	Well two things I think are important to say about Dance Masters, one of them is that,
1680000	1684320	and I mentioned this on one of the daily shows this week, the Rob Roberts and Pals that were
1684320	1688180	on the feed earlier this week, I got served a nice slice of humble pie this week because
1688180	1693520	something I probably said back in 02 or 03 in the early early days of OLR, I know I clearly
1693520	1699400	said, get over it, Para Para Paradise is never coming to the US, absolutely will not happen.
1699400	1703720	Sure enough here we are seven, eight years later, Dance Masters is basically Para Para
1703720	1704720	Paradise.
1704720	1709540	I mean they're going to tell you different songs, it's not all Europe-y, professionally
1709540	1711880	choreographed, but it's still the wrong way.
1711880	1717000	Here's my thing, because the only song that I saw, I mean they have like two songs that
1717000	1721680	they showed, they showed one it was some Naoki Smile Decay song, and they had another one
1721680	1723120	that was Night of Fire.
1723120	1729120	Now I can understand if those maybe have Para dancing to them because it's more Japanese,
1729120	1730800	the Para Club stuff.
1730800	1737080	Now the other songs that are in the game that say are other genres of music, do those have
1737080	1742800	different types of dancing, different styles, because that might be kind of alright.
1742800	1748080	If it's all Para, like if it's Para to some Pink song or something like that, that's a
1748080	1749160	little weird.
1749160	1753920	If it's actually different styles, like if they have country songs with country dancing
1753920	1760040	to it, or if they've got hip hop songs with more street jazz type stuff in there, that
1760040	1761260	makes sense.
1761260	1765360	But if it's just all this Para style dancing, that's kind of weird.
1765360	1769380	I actually thought though, I will say this, I actually thought Dance Masters was the more
1769380	1774280	graphically appealing game in kind of looking at them both side to side.
1774280	1778320	I think in the end, Dance Central was the more easier to follow kind of dance, but I
1778320	1782440	thought Dance Masters kind of looked better in some ways.
1782440	1783440	It's hard to explain.
1783440	1786400	I think a lot of people are probably going to just end up picking up both, especially
1786400	1790840	the crowd that I think mostly listens to this show, but I think ultimately Dance Central
1790840	1792280	is going to prevail in the scales here.
1792280	1794520	I'll check out the other one, but I'll pick up Dance Central.
1794520	1795960	Dance Masters will do better overseas.
1795960	1796960	Well absolutely.
1796960	1800920	But yeah, I had a good time with those games.
1800920	1802920	So let's see, those were the music games.
1802920	1805280	How about something for the non-music game fans?
1805280	1806280	Because this was...
1806280	1810520	Real quick, I was going to say one thing, I mean it wasn't shown on the floor or anything,
1810520	1816360	but one of the games I saw footage of that I thought was really awesome is DJ Hero 2
1816360	1820600	that they're going to be doing, well the karaoke part, cool, whatever.
1820600	1824720	But I do like all the different stuff that they have now where the samples that you do
1824720	1829680	during the freestyle portions are actually part of the song, it's not just crappy flava
1829680	1832000	flave samples over top of everything.
1832000	1836820	And also the freestyle scratching, the freestyle cross-fading stuff looks pretty cool.
1836820	1840720	You know what game unfortunately I did not get my hands on but Shane did and he swears
1840720	1843160	it was probably one of the best games he played at the show?
1843160	1844680	DJ Hero 3D.
1844680	1848280	Yes, I actually want to pick that up.
1848280	1849280	Looks awesome.
1849280	1854560	From what I understand it was a really great experience on the 3DS, so I wish I'd seen
1854560	1857040	it myself but no I got to play some other stuff.
1857040	1861760	I think I played Sims 3 on the 3DS actually, funny enough, which takes your picture and
1861760	1865240	then builds your little Sims character to look like you.
1865240	1866240	To look like your picture?
1866240	1870200	Yes, do you know how huge my nose was?
1870200	1872520	I was a little offended actually.
1872520	1875840	That's still a pretty cool feature, hope they have that in the other versions.
1875840	1876840	That's pretty cool.
1876840	1879520	I just don't want to see how fat my Sim's going to be.
1879520	1880520	Well luckily it only takes pictures of your face.
1880520	1881520	Cannot fit on screen.
1881520	1883520	It only takes pictures of your face, luckily.
1883520	1887240	I'm like, I have more hair left than that, what are you telling me?
1887240	1892760	That's for the 3DS version, you never know with these Kinect cameras and move and stuff.
1892760	1897000	Alright so some folks in chat seem to be getting confused, let's also just clarify.
1897000	1903280	Harmonix is making Dance Central, which is more of the do this for 8 counts, do this
1903280	1907820	for 4 counts, do this for 16 counts type of dance game, breaking it down.
1907820	1914920	Dance Masters is the Konami game that functions a little more like Para Para, but when I say
1914920	1919040	that, it's not 6 streams that you break, it is nothing like that at all, it is tracing
1919040	1921440	motions on the screen and posing in certain ways.
1921440	1923400	It's like Para Para and Elite Beat Agents combined.
1923400	1927520	Yes, that's a good way of describing it actually.
1927520	1931320	How about some non-music games for a minute, because there's one that really surprised
1931320	1932320	me at the show.
1932320	1933320	Don't they exist?
1933320	1934320	Yes.
1934320	1938560	By the way, Jamie, since you have the mic up for a minute, I want to ask you, is there
1938560	1940240	a dance game that you're going to pick up?
1940240	1942800	Or are you like, no thank you, I don't really want to dance, or what?
1942800	1947200	No I think that I want to play Para Para at home, and it's actually kind of funny because
1947200	1950680	just a few days ago I was thinking about hooking up the biscuits.
1950680	1953760	Now what you should have done is done the, because you probably know the Night of Fire
1953760	1955200	routine, right?
1955200	1957120	No, not by heart.
1957120	1958840	Oh, well.
1958840	1959840	What about Sheen?
1959840	1960840	No, Sheen doesn't play Para.
1960840	1961840	No, no.
1961840	1964800	I would have been able to do Boom Boom Fire is probably the only one I still remember
1964800	1965800	after all these years.
1965800	1971900	Hey, I went and played the Para around the corner from, you know, on Arcadia, and I remembered
1971900	1972900	my stuff.
1972900	1975120	I could shake my butt.
1975120	1978760	I probably could have remembered with the stuff on the screen, but why did I need to
1978760	1979760	do it?
1979760	1982480	Bobby Black Wolf, there's a video of him on the internet doing the Night of Fire routine.
1982480	1983480	You should have done it.
1983480	1984820	Free publicity, Rob.
1984820	1988800	When I got up there, Shane specifically said, you better not play Night of Fire.
1988800	1989800	So I did the Smile DK song.
1989800	1990800	Thank you, Shane.
1990800	1991800	Thank you.
1991800	1992800	Thank you.
1992800	1993800	All right.
1993800	1994800	Look, I want to get past this.
1994800	1997560	I do want to say this, though, because somebody who was doing the Night of Fire dance right
1997560	2001080	there at the booth the day I was there, Naoki was there on the floor.
2001080	2002080	I got a picture with him.
2002080	2003080	I got to put it on Facebook.
2003080	2008120	I promised you, if I had a chance to meet Naoki, I would ask him one question, and that
2008120	2010440	question is, and this is how the interaction went.
2010440	2013160	I said, you know, hi there, can I get a picture?
2013160	2014400	And then he said, you know, thank you.
2014400	2016520	And I said, hold on, just one question.
2016520	2020180	I said, is that Facebook really you?
2020180	2023000	And he doesn't speak very good English, he was kind of like Facebook.
2023000	2024560	And I was like, Facebook?
2024560	2027920	And I kind of pointed to my phone, because I don't know how else to describe Facebook.
2027920	2029640	I'm like, is it you?
2029640	2032240	And I'm kind of like pointing on Facebook.
2032240	2035920	And he's like, oh, yes, yes, me on Facebook.
2035920	2038280	And so yes, that Naoki Facebook is really him.
2038280	2043000	They made the mistake, and I kind of feel bad, you know, they made the mistake of him
2043000	2047820	actually speaking during the Konami press conference.
2047820	2049200	And that was the most weird thing.
2049200	2050200	He's adorable.
2050200	2051200	Come on.
2051200	2053200	I know he's adorable, but he doesn't speak good English.
2053200	2059160	So give the guy a damn translator, you know, same with the guy that was describing 99 Nights.
2059160	2066600	If you keep pushing X button and Y button, the game will suck, or you will be sucked.
2066600	2070280	Come on, dude, I need a translator.
2070280	2072280	Don't just let this guy wing it.
2072280	2076320	Do not hate on Naoki on this show, he is adorable.
2076320	2079780	He looks like, you know what he looks like a person, a hyper little kitty cat.
2079780	2082440	He was running around the stage, taking little pictures of his iPhone.
2082440	2085760	He was so happy that people were playing the game and having fun with it.
2085760	2086760	He was so happy.
2086760	2091500	You know, and more props to him, and I know it's not his fault that some of the last DDR
2091500	2095800	games have really been terrible, and you know, and I kind of feel bad in that sense, because
2095800	2099740	they've taken what he created and just kind of took a big dump on it, like they did with
2099740	2101440	Beaten Groovy.
2101440	2105960	But it's just, it's not, it's very awkward, okay?
2105960	2110480	They had a lot of awkward moments during the Konami press conference, speaking of which,
2110480	2115720	and I know it's just kind of like, eh, whatever, Glee, karaoke revolution game.
2115720	2117320	Worst game I played at E3.
2117320	2120000	Yes, I played it, and it's terrible.
2120000	2124080	And I officially don't give a crap about Glee.
2124080	2127080	It was one of those things when we walked in Konami's booth and I kind of looked over
2127080	2131600	and I saw, I mean, it's huge, it was no secret, I was like, I kind of did that moment of,
2131600	2135200	of course, of course, I should have fucking seen that coming, I should have known.
2135200	2137920	Did I have Shane play Def Jam Rapstar?
2137920	2140160	No, no, no, no.
2140160	2141880	Here's why the Glee game was bad.
2141880	2145240	They've basically just done away with the character models and everything.
2145240	2149240	It just plays videos from Glee that sometimes match up with the song and sometimes just
2149240	2150760	completely random videos.
2150760	2155400	And it just, it's, it's not that great.
2155400	2160080	I think I sat there, I think we sang, like, I don't even know what song we sang, but I
2160080	2163600	was singing like this, I was going,
2163600	2164600	Perfect!
2164600	2165600	Yeah, 95%.
2165600	2168840	Granted, I was on the easiest level, but geez.
2168840	2169840	All right.
2169840	2170840	All right.
2170840	2171840	Please, a non-music game.
2171840	2172840	Please, please, please.
2172840	2174440	May I talk about a non-music game?
2174440	2175440	No.
2175440	2176960	Because there was a non-music game I played at the show.
2176960	2178640	Child of Eden looks awesome, by the way.
2178640	2179640	I'm done.
2179640	2180640	Shut up!
2180640	2181640	It does look very awesome.
2181640	2182640	It has Kinky Rockets in it.
2182640	2183640	They're doing the soundtrack.
2183640	2184640	Shup, shup.
2184640	2185640	Dude, I love Kinky Rockets.
2185640	2186640	Hey!
2186640	2187640	Hey, listen.
2187640	2192600	Let me say this, because this is a game you would expect dark soccer to walk away from
2192600	2194360	the show going, I really like this game.
2194360	2202560	But it was me that walked away from the demo for DC Universe going, that PVP was a hell
2202560	2203560	of a lot of fun.
2203560	2204560	Who'd you play?
2204560	2206120	Or did you make your own character?
2206120	2207120	It's all make your own character.
2207120	2209280	You cannot play as Batman or Wonder Woman or any of that.
2209280	2210520	They play as guys.
2210520	2217120	But all the raid gear, quote, unquote, is like clones of Wonder Woman and Superman and
2217120	2218120	all that.
2218120	2220920	So it looks like, you know, we didn't get to do too much of the character creation.
2220920	2226560	It was all PVP, but it looks like your characters can kind of go down a Batman-y path or a Wonder
2226560	2228160	Woman-y path.
2228160	2230000	And the guy who demoed it was really great.
2230000	2235200	He was one of the better demonstrators I was working with during E3.
2235200	2239080	He really was trying to kind of, he could tell we were WoW players, and he was kind
2239080	2241760	of just trying to break it down, like what some of the differences were.
2241760	2245960	And he said that they don't want people to be kind of pigeonholed into these tank and
2245960	2247480	healer and DPS roles.
2247480	2249480	They kind of want everybody to be able to do everything.
2249480	2251320	And I thought that was pretty cool.
2251320	2253160	I just liked, it was more action-based.
2253160	2254320	Here's the thing you need to keep in mind.
2254320	2256920	DC Universe is a much more action-based MMO.
2256920	2261080	Like the only action MMO I've really played to any extent is Phantasy Star Online and
2261080	2262080	Phantasy Star Universe.
2262080	2263080	I love PSO.
2263080	2268240	But I mean, the action in that is really super slow compared to DC Universe.
2268240	2272240	I mean, Phantasy Star is like sword, sword, sword.
2272240	2276840	You know, whereas DC Universe is like punch, punch, punch, ice storm, drink a soda to refuel
2276840	2281520	and then fly up and I swear the best, the moment where I was like, I need to get this
2281520	2284160	game when it comes out November 2nd.
2284160	2287520	Part of the PVP we were doing, it was heroes versus villains, of course.
2287520	2290620	And all the people that were out on the show floor were basically the heroes.
2290620	2295660	The villains were the people in the private rooms getting screened the game.
2295660	2300160	And the guy was like, okay, I'm really not supposed to show you this, but okay, do this.
2300160	2302480	The game was trying to hold down these forts.
2302480	2306880	So it would be like heroes versus villains inside these little techy looking forts and
2306880	2308980	whoever can hold it down longer would win it.
2308980	2311600	He says, go fly onto the top of it.
2311600	2316080	There's an EMP device and hold down the circle button until it counts down to zero.
2316080	2317320	And so I did it.
2317320	2321160	And then while you are holding down the circle button, it flashes back to a scene of the
2321160	2322160	fortress.
2322160	2327240	And once the countdown hits zero, boom, all of the villains went flying out of the room
2327240	2330800	because the EMP device just, it's like a magnet thing that pushes them all out.
2330800	2332320	And I was like, that was fucking rad.
2332320	2334280	I can have this game now, please.
2334280	2335280	Yeah.
2335280	2340360	And the greatest part was knowing that all those villains were the mucky muck oppressed
2340360	2343520	people in the super secret screenings.
2343520	2347440	So I had a really good time with DJ or DJ universe, DC universe.
2347440	2351640	So I want to pick that full game up when it comes out.
2351640	2354400	Final Fantasy 14, we had a demo of that as well.
2354400	2359360	Speaking of MMOs, the game looks astonishing.
2359360	2363520	I feel like this game is not as far along as they would like it to be.
2363520	2368840	I can also say, just knowing some people that are in the private alpha right now, the alpha
2368840	2372880	really does not run very smoothly right now, even on pretty high end computers with a lot
2372880	2377200	of gigs of RAM, none of the settings are changeable and the frame rates in the city is pretty
2377200	2378200	bad.
2378200	2380680	Granted, it's in an early alpha and what did I say before?
2380680	2384680	We shouldn't be forming our final opinions of games off of demos, but the Final Fantasy
2384680	2388680	14, there's a lot that I really like that they did with it.
2388680	2390280	The guild labs, I think, are great.
2390280	2394120	You can start quests out in the field and you can finish them right when you finish
2394120	2395120	them.
2395120	2398500	Monsters are marked, they're easy to find.
2398500	2402880	You can scale the difficulty of any quest you do so that you can either solo quests
2402880	2403880	or you can party.
2403880	2404880	Thank you.
2404880	2406880	I know, it seems like they've really fixed a lot of that.
2406880	2409360	As long as they got rid of the level cap quests, I'm good with that.
2409360	2414300	Now it's just a matter of making the game run smooth because even in the Uber, I was
2414300	2420440	noticing some frame rate issues and I like my games to run very smoothly so I was a little
2420440	2423720	antsy about that because the game's supposed to be coming out pretty soon, but I have a
2423720	2426720	bad feeling it's going to need to go back to the drawing board for some tweaks a little
2426720	2428640	bit to optimize it.
2428640	2433960	I will say this, as it stands right now, I'll pick that game up on the PS3 because that's
2433960	2435440	where they're going to have it optimized for.
2435440	2437520	I think PC is going to be too much of a variable.
2437520	2441520	Oh, did I mention one little unfortunate bombshell about DC Universe?
2441520	2447000	I don't know if this is out there a lot, but the PC and PS3 versions are not cross-server
2447000	2448000	at this time.
2448000	2449720	Yeah, that's what they said last year too.
2449720	2453560	And it sounds like a lot of the reason because of that, it's not that the developer doesn't
2453560	2458120	want to do it, but it sounds like a lot of the reason has to do with kind of balancing
2458120	2459120	issues.
2459120	2463560	It's really different when somebody's playing on the PS3 versus the PC.
2463560	2466600	And I do think Sony's kind of a little bit of a...
2466600	2468480	Did you play it on the PS3 or the PC?
2468480	2469760	I played it on the PS3.
2469760	2472760	Yeah, PS3 was actually pretty easy to control.
2472760	2474200	Yeah, I was very surprised.
2474200	2477080	For an action-y game, it was cool.
2477080	2480880	So, Tigerclaw in chat wants to know, and we're getting like 40 minutes into the show, we'll
2480880	2484140	get into some news here and stuff in a minute, Tigerclaw says, did you get a chance to check
2484140	2485480	out the new Twisted Metal?
2485480	2489920	I watched other people play it, but I am not the big fan of the series that Loki is and
2489920	2490920	so forth.
2490920	2493560	I was very excited that they talked about the new Twisted Metal.
2493560	2497720	But the thing is, they were showing off that Nuke mode, that seemed very confusing to me.
2497720	2501720	Or at least, the whole idea where there's people in helicopters and stuff, that just
2501720	2502720	didn't...
2502720	2504680	I didn't understand what they were doing.
2504680	2506700	I mean, it looks fun.
2506700	2515560	It looks like a slightly better-looking version of Twisted Metal Black, but I kind of want
2515560	2520000	to see what just a normal game looks like, other than that deathmatch mode.
2520000	2521760	Because I liked Black a lot.
2521760	2522760	I loved...
2522760	2527000	I think that was one of the best Twisted Metal games besides Twisted Metal 2.
2527000	2530920	All right, let's get into kind of wrapping up the press conferences a little more officially
2530920	2533280	here than just little tidbits here and there.
2533280	2536920	I do want to say some housekeeping real quick, though, because we're 40 minutes into the
2536920	2539080	show, just now getting to housekeeping.
2539080	2541840	Next week is our eight-year anniversary of Orange Launch Radio.
2541840	2546120	Actually, technically, it's during the week this week, June 23rd, 2002 was our very first
2546120	2547120	show.
2547120	2548120	So happy eight week...
2548120	2549120	Or eight weeks.
2549120	2551720	Happy eight years to us next week.
2551720	2554280	This week seemed like so long.
2554280	2556240	We're not doing anything special for it, really.
2556240	2558320	Just the same old thing we usually do.
2558320	2561800	But just, you know, kind of want to thank our listeners for the support over the eight
2561800	2563560	years of this show.
2563560	2566080	There will be no show the week after that.
2566080	2570500	That next Sunday is the actual 4th of July, which of course is a holiday here in the States.
2570500	2574400	And just due to other things we all want to do that night, there will be no show on the
2574400	2575400	4th of July.
2575400	2576400	Okay?
2576400	2577400	So that's really it for housekeeping.
2577400	2580200	Otherwise, join us on Facebook, Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio.
2580200	2582480	Join us on Twitter, Twitter.com slash OLR.
2582480	2584360	We're still taking Twitter topics.
2584360	2588560	If you have a story you want to share or questions about E3 you want to ask, mailbag is always
2588560	2589560	open as well.
2589560	2591880	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
2591880	2595360	So the beginning of the show tonight, we want to keep it a little more freeform just in
2595360	2600160	kind of wrapping up what happened at E3 and kind of summarizing the press conferences
2600160	2602520	and what everybody kind of thought of the news.
2602520	2605320	Loki, what do you want to say about Microsoft?
2605320	2610400	Because they started everything off the first night before the actual floor show began.
2610400	2616520	Microsoft came out there and in a nutshell focused mostly on Kinect and a bunch of games
2616520	2618240	that we kind of already knew were coming.
2618240	2624880	There was no new games outside of Kinect that were announced besides the one game that,
2624880	2627600	I don't even remember the name of it now, that's what the type of impression it had
2627600	2628600	on me.
2628600	2629600	Yeah, I know what you're talking about.
2629600	2635080	The Crytek Microsoft game studios that I thought was 300 the game because that's what it looked
2635080	2637360	like, 300 the game.
2637360	2640840	So that'll be interesting because Crytek does some really good work.
2640840	2644280	Stuff that I thought was interesting about that press conference and we'll go over like
2644280	2647480	every, well not every little detail, but just some of the basic stuff.
2647480	2657200	The ESPN stuff coming to Xbox Live Marketplace, the actual streaming, I think is kind of cool.
2657200	2661020	Not for me perhaps because I don't give a crap about sports, but for people that do
2661020	2667080	like sports and there's a lot of them out there, I think that's kind of neat.
2667080	2674280	The whole movie Kinect thing where you can control stuff just by voice command almost
2674280	2678920	like sync and motion gestures and stuff like that, that's kind of neat.
2678920	2682680	Can I back up a little bit about the ESPN thing because it kind of goes in that whole
2682680	2686680	integrated television thing and I did think that was cool.
2686680	2690760	I'm not into sports either as much as other people.
2690760	2694840	I might put the local team in and just kind of try Sacramento Kings because that way I'll
2694840	2697640	know if my coworkers are going to be in a good mood or a bad mood the next day.
2697640	2701440	I'll kind of track that in the ESPN thing, but I don't think I'll use it for a lot more
2701440	2703440	other than that.
2703440	2708040	But what really disappointed me was that when we were talking about TV integration, I think
2708040	2712120	one of the things that Microsoft did so well in this past year was one versus 100 and there
2712120	2714920	was literally no news on that front.
2714920	2718280	Not that game, not any of the other types of games that they were talking about.
2718280	2722280	I was extremely disappointed that that subject didn't even come up.
2722280	2725800	Yeah, that's too bad.
2725800	2729240	But other stuff, obviously Kinect was pretty cool.
2729240	2736120	They shut off a bunch of different game demo examples with that, including of course Kinectimals,
2736120	2737400	which I think was pretty cool.
2737400	2743400	If you're going to do one of those sim animal games, that is seriously the way to do it.
2743400	2744680	To me, it was so well done.
2744680	2748320	I think it's going to be a really big game with kids.
2748320	2756240	And when you compare that to the iPad stuff, it just seems a little more natural to me
2756240	2762720	instead of just trying to pet, trying to play with this augmented reality creature type
2762720	2763720	thing.
2763720	2767880	I don't know, it's like Milo in animal form almost.
2767880	2769240	I was bored watching it.
2769240	2770880	Yeah, but it's not meant for us.
2770880	2774440	Yeah, but I feel like hardcore gamers really got the shaft at Microsoft's thing.
2774440	2775440	We didn't get anything.
2775440	2777120	I mean, it was a bunch of games we already knew about.
2777120	2780720	Yeah, but they didn't have anything that was really meant for the hardcore gamer though
2780720	2781720	with Kinect.
2781720	2784320	And isn't that the mistake Nintendo made four years ago?
2784320	2785320	It is.
2785320	2787000	As recent as last year?
2787000	2792500	It's possibly that way, but they may be relying more on third parties to kind of do that stuff.
2792500	2796420	But the problem is they've got the hardcore audience right now.
2796420	2799700	They're not trying to bring in more people necessarily.
2799700	2800880	They have the hardcore gamers.
2800880	2804280	They don't need to worry about the hardcore gamers leaving because there's no Kinect games
2804280	2805280	for them.
2805280	2809400	They're trying to bring on the casual audience that's not playing the Xbox 360 right now.
2809400	2813320	I still kind of think, and I know some folks may argue with me and so forth because, you
2813320	2817100	know, the press conferences are for everybody and it's so that they can get the coverage
2817100	2818100	and so forth.
2818100	2819720	But I'm like, but this is E3.
2819720	2820720	You know what I mean?
2820720	2826380	Like, you know, even CNN who's covering E3 sends their tech guys who play a lot of video
2826380	2827880	games to E3.
2827880	2830600	And I don't think there is on the up and up on a lot of this stuff.
2830600	2835080	I mean, if Xbox wants to show off a lot of these Kinect things, I mean, I understand
2835080	2838680	why it's a big part of the press conference, but some of these games could have been relegated
2838680	2842360	to, you know, being debuted on the Ellen show or something for the appropriate audience.
2842360	2843360	You know what I mean?
2843360	2847600	I just feel like it's not just the one versus a hundred thing, but a lot, I mean, no mention
2847600	2854040	of game room, which really doesn't surprise me, sadly, or just any other big holiday hardcore
2854040	2860320	titles that we didn't already know about was a little disappointing to me.
2860320	2864160	Honestly, I think it would have been better if they never announced Gears 3 a couple months
2864160	2865160	ago.
2865160	2866160	I think they should have kept it under wraps.
2866160	2874200	I don't think there was any advantage to them blowing that on the Jimmy Kimmel show or whatever,
2874200	2877400	no, the Jimmy Fallon show or whatever show it first showed up on.
2877400	2883440	Yeah, I understand that, but at the same time, you know, like I said, their focus with Kinect
2883440	2886040	is not necessarily the hardcore gamers.
2886040	2889440	They've already got them with, you know, the stuff that they have coming out.
2889440	2894120	And there will be stuff later on that will support the hardcore gamer crowd, but it should
2894120	2897240	just not going to be the launch stuff.
2897240	2900960	It's mainly just, you know, more of the casual audience that they're trying to capture in
2900960	2904560	and then, you know, maybe they'll convert some of the hardcore gamers over later on
2904560	2908080	to trying that stuff.
2908080	2909960	And so there's a lot of stuff that they show off there.
2909960	2917280	Obviously, you've got your Wii Sports clone, your Wii Sports Resort type thing with Kinect
2917280	2921880	Adventures, Kinect Sports, seriously, Kinect Sports, couldn't you have done something a
2921880	2922880	little bit different?
2922880	2929640	Call it Kinect Athletics or something like that, you know, it's just so much of a, almost
2929640	2932800	a rip-off, you know.
2932800	2937040	But again, as much as I'm sitting here going, boo press conference, then I got up there
2937040	2941280	and played Dance Central and I was like, okay, it's kind of fun, I got to admit, it's...
2941280	2943600	But yeah, that's more of a casual game though.
2943600	2944600	What's that, DarkSaga?
2944600	2949780	I'm looking at this picture that Tiger Claw linked from Go Nintendo of Miyamoto checking
2949780	2954040	out Kinect.
2954040	2955840	And does he look kind of pissed?
2955840	2958600	He looks sour.
2958600	2963960	That could just be a bad freeze frame though, you know, how like a video is what, like 30
2963960	2965240	pictures a second, you know?
2965240	2966240	Yeah.
2966240	2967600	And I still think it's kind of funny.
2967600	2968840	It is funny.
2968840	2973200	I'd like to see somebody make a comic out of that.
2973200	2976920	And what I was going to say, some of the stuff that they did show that's kind of borderline
2976920	2982400	on the hardcore games that they showed, like integration or possible integration with Forza.
2982400	2985680	And to me, that looked just kind of dumb.
2985680	2989960	I mean, okay, look, with Kinect, you can look around a car, like a virtual car and look
2989960	2992200	at different stuff on the car.
2992200	2993520	I don't care.
2993520	2997280	Or you can drive, you know, by holding your hands in the air like a steering wheel.
2997280	3002760	My arms would get tired, especially, you know, gamers out there, we're not in the best shape
3002760	3005160	and that's going to be, you know...
3005160	3007720	Didn't Joyride look like Excite Truck to you though?
3007720	3008720	No.
3008720	3011040	Joyride totally looked like Excite Truck to me.
3011040	3013480	I mean, I guess the colors and stuff are the same.
3013480	3016680	I heard Joyride was on rails, someone was saying.
3016680	3017680	Was it?
3017680	3018680	I don't know.
3018680	3019680	I didn't play it at all.
3019680	3021640	I looked like they were doing the tricks and jumping through rings and stuff that really
3021640	3022680	reminded me of Excite Truck.
3022680	3025160	And what happened to Joyride being a free game?
3025160	3026160	Hello?
3026160	3031040	It was supposed to be a free game on Xbox Live Arcade and then with paid download content
3031040	3035440	and stuff, it was supposed to be a whole new different experiment and they just set aside
3035440	3037880	and yeah, you know what, we're just going to charge $60 for it.
3037880	3039520	That game is not worth $60.
3039520	3043520	Maybe it'll be a pack-in game with the Kinect, because a lot of folks are speculating Kinect
3043520	3049840	is $150 right now, which is fine, but I mean, if you have to buy a game separately, then
3049840	3053040	aren't you really paying $210 to play a game on Kinect?
3053040	3058400	It's the same thing if you even talk about, like, look at the bundles that they have right
3058400	3063080	now for the PlayStation Move.
3063080	3069860	You can get a bundle that comes with the Move controller, the camera, and a game for $130.
3069860	3074600	And that's not including the extra controller that you need for some of the other games,
3074600	3083120	kind of the nunchuck for the Move type thing, which you don't necessarily need, but come
3083120	3084120	on.
3084120	3087600	You're going to need it if you're going to want to be able to play everything out there.
3087600	3088720	It's the same argument, both.
3088720	3089960	It's just perception.
3089960	3093040	You know what, I see Dark Soccer kind of looking at pictures over there, and it kind of reminds
3093040	3098000	me, one of the games I would have liked to have seen them demo on the expo floor, I mean,
3098000	3101480	I'm sorry, not the expo floor, but at the press conference as opposed to some of these,
3101480	3106080	you know, Wii game rip-offs that they were demoing, is the Child of Eden game.
3106080	3107080	That would have been cool.
3107080	3109460	I've been looking at pictures from it.
3109460	3111460	That's one thing that would have made me a little happier, is to bring out this new chip.
3111460	3112960	See, that's more like a hardcore game.
3112960	3113960	Yes, exactly.
3113960	3116640	Why waste my time with Wii Sports clones?
3116640	3119320	We all know you're going to rip off the Wii, quit wasting my time.
3119320	3121120	That's just pretty.
3121120	3126280	I think they should have shown the Child of Eden demo, but maybe it wasn't ready or whatever.
3126280	3130880	I'm just absolutely, look, the fail whale made an appearance.
3130880	3133600	I think a lot of times, though, with these demos, they're really nervous about things
3133600	3134600	going wrong.
3134600	3136400	Like, the things have to be exactly perfect.
3136400	3140280	Case in point, what happened with the Zelda demonstration at Nintendo's press conference.
3140280	3142360	They were having a lot of problems.
3142360	3144840	And what's funny is that was the first thing, I don't mean to skip ahead, but that was the
3144840	3147720	first thing Nintendo was showing at their press conference, and it started to make a
3147720	3154000	lot of us go, here we go, in Nintendo's fail conference 2010, and then Reggie just kind
3154000	3158840	of was like, you know, we'll get into that in a minute, but definitely the tone changed
3158840	3159840	quickly.
3159840	3163440	What did you think of yourself, fitness on the Kinect?
3163440	3164440	I thought that was kind of neat.
3164440	3166040	I think that's Kinect's biggest strength.
3166040	3170360	I think that's where Kinect stands to make a lot of money right now, and if they're smart,
3170360	3175120	they're gonna do tie-ins with the Biggest Loser TV show, and some of these exercise
3175120	3176120	platforms.
3176120	3177480	They do have a Biggest Loser game coming.
3177480	3180000	I know, and who called it, here on the show?
3180000	3184400	And you were like, no, they already have a Biggest Loser game.
3184400	3185680	I'm a games analyst.
3185680	3192440	Anyway, all joking aside, I think the exercise gaming is gonna be Kinect's biggest strength,
3192440	3194560	and I think, is where they should go with it.
3194560	3197760	Get off the couch, fatty, play some Kinect.
3197760	3203480	Other things that they had, you know, out of the conference, let's see, Fable 3.
3203480	3205960	I could care less about Fable 3.
3205960	3210480	Basically, Fable 3 to me, you could have just shown me footage from Fable 2, it would have
3210480	3211480	looked the same.
3211480	3214520	I played what they had available on the show floor.
3214520	3217720	I didn't understand what the hell was going on, because it was kind of in the middle of
3217720	3219120	a quest already.
3219120	3221920	I noticed that the little golden trails were still there telling you what to do, and you
3221920	3225400	still had the dog, and then the particular quest I was doing, you got to put on a big
3225400	3229040	chicken suit, and I guess round-up chickens, and I was amused by the fact that you were
3229040	3233000	in a chicken suit, but yes, otherwise, I really didn't see anything that felt different to
3233000	3235920	me than Fable 2.
3235920	3240200	But hold on, I do want to say, I mean, you make it sound like Fable 2 is a bad game though.
3240200	3244640	I think a lot of people will be perfectly content if Fable 3 is just more Fable 2, because
3244640	3245640	it was a great game.
3245640	3247640	I got bored with it after a while.
3247640	3251720	Okay, one of the coolest trailers I thought that they showed during the whole Microsoft
3251720	3257320	press conference was for Metal Gear Solid Rising, where you can cut things pretty much
3257320	3258960	wherever you want.
3258960	3259960	That was awesome.
3259960	3260960	Absolutely awesome.
3260960	3267680	I can get behind a game like that.
3267680	3272680	Other cool things, you know, Reach, they were talking a little bit about some of the single
3272680	3276200	player campaign, they showed some footage from that, it looks really epic, and now they're
3276200	3279440	going to have space dog fighting and stuff like that, that'll be pretty cool.
3279440	3284880	You know, going to be a great game, of course.
3284880	3292360	I don't know, other than that, I'm trying to think of what else they really showed.
3292360	3296400	They didn't really talk too much about Xbox Live Arcade either, I don't think.
3296400	3300080	Well there's a Summer of Arcade promo they're doing that has a lot of high profile games,
3300080	3305120	like the Hydro Thunder I believe is a part of that, and the Hydrophobia I think is in
3305120	3308480	there too in the Castlevania game that we talked about a little earlier.
3308480	3311400	You know, that's back, and that's kind of where Arcade's going.
3311400	3314940	I was personally disappointed in the lack of Game Room news, and I think just further
3314940	3318620	cements the fact that I think Microsoft's already written it off, but I'll save that
3318620	3323440	rant for another episode of OLR when they finally stop releasing content for Game Room.
3323440	3330880	Yeah, I think that's about it, I want to say for, of course the new Xbox looks kind of
3330880	3335440	sexy and stuff, you know, all the rumors are true of course, you know.
3335440	3341240	Please America, Europe, Japan, everybody out there listening to the show, Canada, stop
3341240	3343920	calling it the Xbox 360 slim.
3343920	3344920	It's not slim.
3344920	3345920	Have you seen it?
3345920	3349040	Have you seen it next to the old Xbox 360?
3349040	3352040	It's still fat.
3352040	3357720	That's like saying like a guy who went from 300 pounds to 280 pounds is now skinny.
3357720	3360440	I mean, they're still fluffy.
3360440	3362880	And there's not that there's anything wrong with that, not that there's anything wrong
3362880	3367640	with the new Xbox 360, but it is not slim.
3367640	3372600	It's just the new Xbox 360, and the relaunch of the system we all knew was going to be
3372600	3373920	happening when Kinect came out.
3373920	3378160	Yeah, and it's smaller, it does have a Kinect port on it that's going to provide power to
3378160	3382160	the Kinect sensor if you want to, otherwise if you have an old system you just use the
3382160	3389080	AC adapter, and then of course, you know, it has the integrated GPU CPU into one chip
3389080	3393720	and the internal 250 gigabyte hard drive, which I heard was actually, you can interchange
3393720	3397640	it like the PlayStation one, but I'm not positive.
3397640	3401600	That's what I'm hearing too, is that it's not as hard wired in there as the old drives
3401600	3402600	were.
3402600	3406360	But here's the thing, I don't think those systems are for the people who already own
3406360	3407360	Xboxes.
3407360	3413440	It's to piss off those of us that just bought an Xbox a few months ago, thank you, and you
3413440	3416080	know, it's a push into the holiday season.
3416080	3421080	And all it is, is basically just an upgrade to the current stuff that they have out there,
3421080	3424440	and you bet your ass they're going to do another fucking price drop in the fourth quarter,
3424440	3426840	so you might as well just wait.
3426840	3431160	I mean, because seriously, they're going to do another price drop, I think they've already
3431160	3437520	said that they're going to be doing something new towards the holidays, so just be patient.
3437520	3443920	Alright, so anything else you want to say about Microsoft or Microsoft related stuff?
3443920	3444920	Dark Sakura?
3444920	3448320	She's going to be picking up a Kinect to shake her booty.
3448320	3449320	That's fine.
3449320	3450320	Alright, how about Nintendo?
3450320	3454280	Let me give you my impression of Nintendo's press conference this year, because you know,
3454280	3457640	Nintendo, everybody's expectations were very low for Nintendo.
3457640	3462720	You know, everybody was expecting something more on the 3DS, but I think other than that,
3462720	3465320	everybody kind of went in there with their expectations low, but it basically went something
3465320	3466320	like this.
3466320	3472520	Reggie Fils-Aime comes out on stage, hi, I'm Reggie Fils-Aime, prepare to have your minds
3472520	3473960	fucking blown.
3473960	3478000	Here's the new Zelda game we've been talking about for a little while, and now, here's
3478000	3483360	a new Wii game, Kirby, here's a new Wii game, GoldenEye, who doesn't love GoldenEye?
3483360	3487040	Here's a new Wii game, Donkey Kong Country, here's a new Wii game, I mean, he's just naming
3487040	3493160	game after game after game after game, and then, oh, and by the way, the Wii is still
3493160	3497600	selling well, all those reports about the people are not buying games for the Wii are
3497600	3500440	bullshit, so don't you ever talk fucking bad about my system again.
3500440	3502720	Here comes Iwata to tell you about the 3DS.
3502720	3507800	That was basically what the press conference was, and then they talk about the 3DS, and
3507800	3508800	it's real, y'all.
3508800	3514560	I mean, having seen the thing in person now, I can tell you, it really does work.
3514560	3518240	It's a pretty impressive piece of technology.
3518240	3523240	Here's how I interpreted the press conference.
3523240	3526840	The Zelda game came out, and they were showing off stuff, honestly, they should have just
3526840	3531680	shown a trailer, because I could care less watching him try to play the damn Zelda game,
3531680	3533720	and I do like the way it looks.
3533720	3538480	It's kind of a cross between Wind Waker and Twilight Princess.
3538480	3545480	I like how it's very colorful, it's got that kind of cel-shaded look to it, but it's still,
3545480	3546480	you know...
3546480	3549680	It looks like cel-shaded watercolor, you know?
3549680	3550980	That's my take on it.
3550980	3556440	It's more pastel-y, and less like toilet water filter that the last game had.
3556440	3561560	Well, it looks like a Wii game, and not like, oh look, it's a GameCube game, or even a
3561560	3564280	Nintendo 64 game, or something like that.
3564280	3566600	So that's cool.
3566600	3570200	The demonstration, though, they seriously needed to cut down that demonstration, because
3570200	3571200	it was not exciting.
3571200	3572200	It did go on a little long.
3572200	3573200	It was long.
3573200	3576120	But they know people are excited about Zelda, and that was one of the big things that everybody
3576120	3577120	wanted to hear about.
3577120	3580600	But, uh, sg100matt in our chatroom says, by the way, Reggie has gotten more and more chubby
3580600	3582920	E.T.E.3, he hasn't been playing his Wii Fit.
3582920	3587600	Dude, sg100matt, I would be careful, because Reggie will bring out some charts, and fuck
3587600	3589600	your shit up if you decide to talk back.
3589600	3590600	I'm sorry!
3590600	3594880	I don't buy his, oh, people haven't, you know, been playing the Wii, you know, or people
3594880	3597080	are playing the Wii, and all that stuff.
3597080	3598200	Where's your data?
3598200	3600720	You know, you coming out here and saying this, I don't buy it.
3600720	3602200	You cited MPD figures.
3602200	3606760	Yeah, MPD figures, they cover what games are selling.
3606760	3611040	And yeah, I'm sure a lot of people are buying Super Mario Galaxy and that kind of stuff,
3611040	3617120	but every other game, like, of other genres, like say, some of the hardcore games and whatnot,
3617120	3619400	those are not selling well.
3619400	3624960	And you know, I can't say that the whole system's a success, but it's definitely, certain genres
3624960	3628120	are doing well, and certain ones are not.
3628120	3632400	It's perhaps just because they don't have all, I don't think they have the hardcore
3632400	3633400	demographic.
3633400	3638200	They have kind of like the families playing the game, and you know, the people that are
3638200	3644040	big Nintendo fanboys, you know, playing just the Nintendo products, and that's about it.
3644040	3647680	I think a lot of folks in chat are wondering, because they know I'm a hardcore Kid Icarus
3647680	3652400	fan from back in the day, like what I was thinking when that Project Sora thing happened.
3652400	3653600	You can pretty much imagine it.
3653600	3654760	My jaw was on the floor.
3654760	3658840	I was like, you know, and then as they were announcing it, I was like, oh my god, this
3658840	3659840	makes perfect sense.
3659840	3662960	This is why they kept it such a big secret.
3662960	3664540	The whole Kid Icarus thing made perfect sense.
3664540	3668880	And it was really the defining moment of Nintendo's press conference for me, where I was like,
3668880	3671120	oh my god, they're back, thank you.
3671120	3675440	Whoever hid Kami under the rafters, and whoever put the Wii Vitality sensor somewhere far,
3675440	3678040	far away, thank you so much.
3678040	3680400	Mario Sports is kind of dumb.
3680400	3681400	Played it.
3681400	3684280	It's a kid's game.
3684280	3686360	I wasn't a huge fan of it.
3686360	3690480	I did think Wii Party was better than a lot of people are passing it off as, though.
3690480	3695560	But the interesting thing is, my question is, if the 3DS is not coming out this holiday
3695560	3699360	season, which I don't know, I kind of think it's not going to.
3699360	3700360	I think it is.
3700360	3703940	Well, I mean, and the one good reason I'm hearing for why it is coming out this holiday
3703940	3705920	season, what else does Nintendo have?
3705920	3709400	Because we know Zelda got pushed back to 2011, so what are the big releases?
3709400	3710960	Goldeneye, that'll be a big title.
3710960	3711960	Kirby, I think.
3711960	3713480	Kirby, which was certainly worthy.
3713480	3717560	Epic Mickey, so they're putting a lot of stock in a third-party title, but it's a worthy
3717560	3718560	title.
3718560	3719560	I did play a little bit of that, too.
3719560	3720560	Looks very good.
3720560	3724680	Wii Party, I think will be one that they really back this holiday season.
3724680	3730720	I don't think it's for everybody, but I think it's kind of Mario Party a little more chopped
3730720	3736680	up than just the full game for more short attention span folks.
3736680	3737680	Kirby looked okay.
3737680	3742440	I never really have been a big fan of Kirby, but I definitely like the style of the game.
3742440	3743440	It's definitely unique.
3743440	3745680	There's nothing out there like it.
3745680	3747240	So that was kind of cool.
3747240	3751280	Wii Party, I just kind of, my mind turned off during the whole, like, you know, Wii
3751280	3752280	Party thing.
3752280	3753280	I just don't care.
3753280	3754280	It's fine.
3754280	3757040	You play these little mini games, and what's funny is that one of them looks just like
3757040	3762000	that rafting game they were showing in Microsoft's adventures thing, but it was funny.
3762000	3766720	We played this boat stacking game where you had to stack people on a boat, and the size
3766720	3771120	of the people was determined on how well you did in the mini game, and we, you know, Shane
3771120	3775720	and I were getting competitive, and we were cracking up when all the people were falling
3775720	3776720	off the boat.
3776720	3778600	You know what's funny?
3778600	3782760	Metroid Other M just kind of had to be on the same level as all these other games.
3782760	3786440	I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm still really excited about that game, but there was so
3786440	3790880	much for Nintendo to show that this year Metroid wasn't able to stand out like it did last
3790880	3791880	year.
3791880	3795080	Metroid Other M, and it's sad, like, with the people I'm talking to, don't really seem
3795080	3799040	to understand how awesome this game is gonna be.
3799040	3804360	I think it looks really, really cool, so it'll be interesting to see when that comes out.
3804360	3807500	The new Donkey Kong game, I kind of like how they're going back to the old school stuff
3807500	3809560	with that, and see, that's the thing.
3809560	3813400	Even with, like, new Super Mario Brothers, you don't have to reinvent the wheel.
3813400	3816600	Just put out a good, you know, game that's in that genre.
3816600	3823000	You don't even have to, like, go, like, all brand new with it, just, you know, a new game.
3823000	3824320	I played the new GoldenEye game.
3824320	3825320	It's a lot of fun.
3825320	3827720	I played this odd job and kept killing Shane with my hat.
3827720	3828720	It was a lot of fun.
3828720	3829720	Good times.
3829720	3830720	You threw a shoe?
3830720	3831720	Seriously?
3831720	3832720	Who threw a shoe?
3832720	3833720	It was fun.
3833720	3834720	It was fun.
3834720	3837720	I had a good time with GoldenEye.
3837720	3841520	I'm trying to think what other cool stuff they were showing off.
3841520	3846240	Epic Mickey, like, the demo that they did of that didn't, like, half of it didn't really
3846240	3847700	impress me too much.
3847700	3850960	The other half, though, was pretty cool with, like, the whole Steamboat Willie, like, kind
3850960	3851960	of.
3851960	3854560	Yeah, that part was my favorite, too, but what really kind of impressed me about Epic
3854560	3858580	Mickey that actually surprised me a lot is that you can kind of play Mickey a little
3858580	3859580	devious.
3859580	3864000	Like, there was a stage that we were looking at during the demo where you get sent by one
3864000	3870980	of the characters to collect masks, and what you can do is you can go collect one mask,
3870980	3874500	take it to him, and he'll say, okay, now get me two more, and what you can do is you go
3874500	3879360	around to the back of the shop, use your thinner to break down the door so you can just go
3879360	3883000	into the back of the shop, take that same mask you just turned in, then go back to the
3883000	3887200	front of the store and say, here's mask number two, and he'll go, hmm, I don't remember them
3887200	3890020	coming in a set, but okay, and he'll give you credit.
3890020	3894160	So you can play the game as kind of like Good Mickey or Bad Mickey, which really surprised
3894160	3897760	me that you'd be able to do that in a Mickey Mouse game.
3897760	3898760	You know what I mean?
3898760	3901080	It's supposed to be like...
3901080	3902080	Now here's the thing.
3902080	3903080	Heart of Gold.
3903080	3906540	Remember how they have like the concept art for Epic Mickey, and they have the really
3906540	3909240	twisted, creepy-ass looking characters?
3909240	3910240	Were any of them in there?
3910240	3913800	Because it seems to me that they really like G-rated the whole damn thing.
3913800	3918480	It's not as like cool and epic as it was before.
3918480	3920320	Um, yes and no.
3920320	3924180	I think a lot of that just wasn't in the demo they were showing on the show floor, but with
3924180	3930140	the whole paint thinner angle, and the fact that Mickey can be deceptive, I think it could
3930140	3931240	be in there.
3931240	3933200	We just didn't see it at E3.
3933200	3938400	I wouldn't lose hope on that front yet, Loki.
3938400	3941840	As far as Nintendo goes, I do want to talk just a minute about the 3DS, because I know
3941840	3947240	a lot of people are really curious about what the game, or what the system kind of feels
3947240	3949040	like.
3949040	3953520	Don't expect things to fly out at you, like in some of those commercials.
3953520	3957160	Imagine you're kind of like looking out this window, or looking down a hallway that has
3957160	3959680	depth that kind of goes in.
3959680	3961880	That's what the 3DS kind of looks like.
3961880	3963880	I don't know how they do the technology.
3963880	3966520	I don't know if it's functioning on prisms is what I hear.
3966520	3971120	No, it's basically, they've got a different layer on there that directs light to both
3971120	3972120	your eyes.
3972120	3978120	It's like, you know how interlaced TV works, how they have different lines that update
3978120	3979120	every so often?
3979120	3983800	Well imagine that, but vertical, and instead of it being updated differently, half of those
3983800	3988360	lines are going to your right eye, half of those lines are going to your left eye.
3988360	4003160	It's basically like, what do they call it, not lithograph, lenticular.
4003160	4007500	Have you ever seen those boxes like for Saw, for example, the 3D one, or Final Destination
4007500	4008500	3D.
4008500	4011600	That one that they had where you look at it and it looks like the stuff's kind of popping
4011600	4017200	out because they've got basically this piece of plastic that kind of has ridges on it that
4017200	4020960	kind of acts like a prism and pushes it to your left eye and right eye.
4020960	4022180	That's basically how it works.
4022180	4025320	They focus the image to two different eyes.
4025320	4028280	It's like the virtual boy, but less headache inducing.
4028280	4033640	Well let me tell you though, the best thing, I noticed the pull on my eyes, and I was kind
4033640	4037120	of like, okay this is not going to be a healthy thing for me to play for a couple hours.
4037120	4039080	Here's the best thing about it.
4039080	4044320	There's a slider that you can adjust the intensity of the 3D, and if the 3D gets too gimmicky
4044320	4046560	and too dumb for you, you just turn it off.
4046560	4048360	Presto change-o 2D.
4048360	4051680	One of the cool things that I did see them announce when they were talking about the
4051680	4056920	3DS is that they're going to have support from movie studios to put out 3D movies on
4056920	4057920	that thing.
4057920	4058920	Yes.
4058920	4059920	That's a cool idea.
4059920	4062960	One of the demos they were showing was Disney's Tangled, one of the movies, I guess it's out
4062960	4063960	in theaters.
4063960	4068840	The trailer, and that was some of the most impressive use of 3D they had.
4068840	4073240	I was not seeing artifacting or anything on the screen, I mean it was only the top screen,
4073240	4079080	didn't really use the bottom screen at all, but this will be great for kids.
4079080	4080080	Even some adults too.
4080080	4083600	I don't think they're talking about a lot of adult movies on the 3D technology yet,
4083600	4087320	but certainly the kids stuff, I think there's going to be a lot of people very happy.
4087320	4091720	And of course, the developers list, which I'm not sure if we're getting into later,
4091720	4095880	but lots of cool stuff, you know, all the big games, Mario Kart and stuff.
4095880	4099520	Wish they had a WarioWare game, you know, right there.
4099520	4103200	Still, I mean, if you go by the golden rule of gaming, a system is only as good as the
4103200	4104200	games that are on it.
4104200	4106680	This thing has the games to back it up.
4106680	4109320	The cartridges are different from the regular DS.
4109320	4112680	The graphical power felt more like a Playstation 2 in there.
4112680	4114120	I mean, not quite at that level.
4114120	4118260	I don't think especially a lot of the rendering will be, but you know, like the Kingdom Hearts
4118260	4121620	little demo I saw looked like the freaking game on the PS2.
4121620	4127720	So you know, a lot of it is going to be pretty impressive and yeah, I mean, there's the games
4127720	4130020	to back it up at the end of the day.
4130020	4133640	It doesn't, it's not like the Playstation move where I can't think of a single game
4133640	4136800	I really want to buy the move for.
4136800	4140080	And Connect, I'm kind of teeter tottering, I'm like, well, I guess there's the two dance
4140080	4141080	games.
4141080	4145520	Connect, I'm actually planning on picking up and I actually kind of want to pick up
4145520	4150160	like the Connect Adventures thing because I think that'd be a fun party game.
4150160	4153120	The Dance Central stuff, I think that'd be pretty fun.
4153120	4157120	The Fitness game, I'm not sure because, you know, I bought Wii Fit, I'm like, oh, I'm
4157120	4158640	going to do that and stuff.
4158640	4165640	It just, I need an excuse to work out, you know, but I don't know if I'd actually do
4165640	4166640	that.
4166640	4169360	It's just like, games like that make me feel like awkward, you know what I mean?
4169360	4173120	Where it's like you can do something, I mean, playing DDR I guess would be kind of awkward
4173120	4177200	looking too, but I never felt awkward playing the game, you know what I mean?
4177200	4179200	So, I don't know.
4179200	4180200	Alright.
4180200	4186040	Let's move on, I guess, then to Sony, if we've kind of talked enough about 3DS and so forth.
4186040	4188800	What did Sony do, Loki?
4188800	4194920	Sony had, of course, their big thing was, they showed off the Move stuff and 3D.
4194920	4201560	3D was the big thing for them, of course they were talking about partners with third party
4201560	4203600	companies for different 3D things.
4203600	4209600	Now, it's a little deceptive in how they were talking about 3D, because certain games like
4209600	4218000	Crysis 2 will not only be 3D on the Playstation platform, they will be 3D also on the Xbox
4218000	4219800	360 as well.
4219800	4223800	Not all games, though, I think were going to be 3D, but as one of their big focus, obviously
4223800	4231080	the 3D Blu-Ray is going to be available with a firmware update, which that is pretty cool
4231080	4236320	because if you don't have it, you would have to actually buy a whole new Blu-Ray player.
4236320	4242600	Also, they were showing off some new games, different franchises, like Twisted Metal was
4242600	4246800	one of the big ones that they announced, which is kind of cool, Motorstorm Apocalypse, which
4246800	4250840	I think looks pretty fun.
4250840	4254740	Little Big Planet 2, I got some hands on time with on the show floor, and the level we were
4254740	4259820	playing was a race level, but it introduced the grappling hook, and not only could you
4259820	4264280	grapple on certain parts of the scenery, but you could grapple the other players, and that
4264280	4265280	made it a lot of fun.
4265280	4266640	We had a lot of fun with that.
4266640	4270960	Otherwise, stylistically, it really just looks like the first game, and graphically, but
4270960	4275960	this upgrade is really more about the extra tools that are in it than anything else, which
4275960	4276960	I think most people do.
4276960	4280360	I do like how you can have good control over everything, how you can make puzzle games
4280360	4287060	and top-down action games or whatever, RPGs, that's pretty cool.
4287060	4291840	So it'll be interesting to see what levels are created by that, because I know I'm pretty
4291840	4297000	creative, but I just don't have time to do it, so thankfully there's a community of millions
4297000	4301880	of players out there to do it for me, so yeah.
4301880	4304380	I don't know, there wasn't a lot at Sony's press conference that really made me jump
4304380	4307080	up and down and scream, except for Kevin Butler coming on stage.
4307080	4308080	That was awesome.
4308080	4310880	I know it makes me kitty.
4310880	4312080	What's that?
4312080	4313440	The P word.
4313440	4314640	The P word?
4314640	4317720	The second of the P words.
4317720	4318720	You lost me.
4318720	4319720	Portal 2.
4319720	4325120	Ah, Portal 2, of course, how could we forget, that was the big ending to Sony's press conference
4325120	4331080	where Valve is basically saying, oh yeah, yeah, I guess we will make stuff for the PlayStation
4331080	4332080	3 after all.
4332080	4335280	That's basically what it was, like, we'll stop ignoring you.
4335280	4341000	But I think even more so than just the fact that Portal 2 is coming out for the system,
4341000	4345680	is more the fact that Steam is going to have some integration with the PS3.
4345680	4349200	That was the biggest newsworthy thing to me.
4349200	4351000	Did you see the trailer for Portal 2?
4351000	4352040	I sure did.
4352040	4353040	You monster.
4353040	4354040	I know.
4354040	4359600	But now, I've watched, and we were actually able to, you know, we've got our TV out front
4359600	4366120	with a computer hooked up to it so we can watch YouTube videos at the high res, and
4366120	4373400	we watched the playthrough demonstrations, and that was really exciting.
4373400	4382280	But there was also an interview that G4 had up with one of the designers talking about
4382280	4388800	the story that, you know, you didn't escape, it's in the future, the far future, and you're
4388800	4389800	still there.
4389800	4390800	Oops.
4390800	4400240	They're actually in the playtesting part for both of the storylines, but there's two stories
4400240	4401240	going on.
4401240	4405000	One is strictly for single player, and the other is for cooperative play.
4405000	4408920	So instead of cooperative being a tackline, cooperative has its own story.
4408920	4409920	I noticed that.
4409920	4410920	I thought that was pretty cool.
4410920	4412160	And it makes sense for a game like Portal.
4412160	4415880	It would be very hard to integrate them both in the same game.
4415880	4420080	But by the way, just in case it hasn't already been mentioned or you didn't hear, you know
4420080	4423160	why that Portal 2 party got cancelled after all?
4423160	4425360	It wasn't because Valve wanted to show something else out.
4425360	4428720	They were going to announce the PlayStation thing at that party.
4428720	4435520	But Sony came to them and said, you know, basically in so many words, um, actually,
4435520	4439060	could you wait and come out on stage at our press conference?
4439060	4442760	That's why no Portal 2 event happened.
4442760	4446440	Killzone 3 looked awesome, and I can only imagine what that looks like in 3D.
4446440	4449400	So that was kind of cool.
4449400	4454640	The PlayStation Move stuff, I just couldn't get too excited about what they were showing.
4454640	4459340	I know it's going to have support for SOCOM 4 and stuff like that, and I know that they
4459340	4465320	have a new Time Crisis game, which, by the way, never forget that they did come out with
4465320	4468200	a gun con for the Time Crisis game.
4468200	4470920	What a waste of money that was.
4470920	4472640	Thank you, Namco!
4472640	4476580	Did you hear though that the Time Crisis game, there's going to be a mode that's off rails?
4476580	4479200	I'm like, that's not Time Crisis!
4479200	4480200	They had that in the last one.
4480200	4481200	Did they really?
4481200	4482200	Yeah.
4482200	4483200	I didn't know that.
4483200	4486000	But see, the gun con in the last one was actually pretty cool, because they did have, you know,
4486000	4491100	the kind of a dual grip for it, and they had, you know, one analog stick on your left hand
4491100	4494120	where you'd be holding it in the front of the gun, and the right analog, you know, in
4494120	4495120	the back of the gun.
4495120	4498720	And actually that worked really well for first-person shooters, except it was the only game that
4498720	4500400	used that, which is really sad.
4500400	4505400	They didn't even really need Move, they could have done it with this thing, but whatever.
4505400	4510300	So they've got a, you know, new Time Crisis game, and whoopty shit.
4510300	4512240	Where the hell did The Last Guardian go?
4512240	4515880	That was one of the big standouts from last year, and it just kind of disappeared, didn't
4515880	4516880	it?
4516880	4519080	Yeah, they didn't mention anything, but it's supposed to be still coming out.
4519080	4520800	Hmm, I found that to be a little strange.
4520800	4523520	Maybe it was just me, but I was very disappointed.
4523520	4526000	Still on my list for November.
4526000	4527000	Interesting.
4527000	4530320	I like how Gran Turismo 5 has a date again.
4530320	4535040	Let's see if they actually hit that date this time.
4535040	4536040	We'll see.
4536040	4539160	Alright, so I guess we're done with press conferences.
4539160	4542640	Let's kind of go around and see what everybody's- oh, you have something else you want to add?
4542640	4545960	No, I want to talk about some of the other smaller press conferences real quick.
4545960	4546960	Sure, sure.
4546960	4547960	Please do.
4547960	4548960	Just make a quick mention.
4548960	4555660	While they didn't show the Vitality sensor, Ubisoft had their sort of Vitality sensor
4555660	4557240	game, I guess.
4557240	4561040	It wasn't really called a Vitality sensor, I forget what they were calling it, but it
4561040	4566640	was like a breathing, relaxing game or something, which I thought was funny, because I wonder
4566640	4571040	if that, you know, you would think that they aren't actually coming out of the Vitality
4571040	4578720	sensor now, since that thing basically is the Vitality sensor, and that, you know, Nintendo
4578720	4581100	would be suing them, if that were the case.
4581100	4582100	So that was interesting.
4582100	4586760	They showed a lot of games that weren't really games, like they had a PC laser tag game,
4586760	4589000	but all the PC did was basically keep score.
4589000	4594560	It was actually, you know, a real laser tag, like, pack and crap that you bought and put
4594560	4597480	on and went and shot your friends and stuff like that.
4597480	4601160	And Joel McHale looked really awkward hosting the Ubisoft thing.
4601160	4602560	The new Rayman game looks awesome.
4602560	4603800	Have you seen that?
4603800	4605560	The episodic one?
4605560	4611560	It's just- it's all really pretty hand-drawn and just really awesome.
4611560	4617720	And then the last one that they showed, which also was kind of weird, and they were- it
4617720	4625400	was funny because they were saying it wasn't really a game, was Mania Planet, which, you
4625400	4629280	know, I'm kind of a fan of the Track Mania series, but they're going to be having two
4629280	4633360	new PC titles that are going to be able- you're going to be able to make your own custom games
4633360	4635000	out of.
4635000	4639320	Shoot Mania, which is going to be like a first-person shooter kind of editor, creator type thing,
4639320	4644440	and RPG Mania, which you'll be able to make your own RPG Mania- or your RPG type games.
4644440	4648360	And of course, a new Track Mania game that's going to be coming out, which looks very pretty,
4648360	4651920	so those are pretty cool.
4651920	4653320	That's pretty much it for right now.
4653320	4654320	Alright.
4654320	4655320	Let's go around.
4655320	4659840	I just kind of want to get everybody's thoughts on the, you know, in your opinion, the best
4659840	4666220	thing about E3, and the worst thing about E3, I'll start.
4666220	4669960	The best thing about E3 was by far the 3DS.
4669960	4675500	I mean, just actually getting to see it and use it and behold, this new piece of technology
4675500	4678640	was really something else, even if the lines the first day were pretty ugly, but they got
4678640	4680700	a little more manageable as the show went on.
4680700	4683080	So obviously the best thing was by far the 3DS.
4683080	4689080	Worst thing about E3 was flaky flakes like Activision and Blizzard, you know, being under
4689080	4692200	the same umbrella, just not even- deciding they don't even need a booth anymore.
4692200	4696140	I realized they had their own off event, I realized they think they're at a level where
4696140	4701740	they can just not put up with the show of E3, but I just- I don't know, it's kind of-
4701740	4702740	I get-
4702740	4703740	Sounds tacky.
4703740	4704740	It's a little tacky to me.
4704740	4708040	I mean, they're kind of reeking of that kid who takes the ball and goes home because they
4708040	4709240	don't like the rules of the game.
4709240	4712320	You know, it's just- it's unfortunate, I think.
4712320	4716580	And just the fact that Blizzard will not show anything at E3, because basically they can
4716580	4721680	charge people $150 who will go see it at their own convention, and then the tickets get scalped
4721680	4727400	on eBay, so basically people are really paying like $400 to go see these demos of games they're
4727400	4729600	going to end up buying regardless anyway.
4729600	4734080	Personally, I think BlizzCon is a big fat joke, but I guess I'll save that rant for
4734080	4736720	another edition of OLR.
4736720	4737720	So.
4737720	4741000	Anyhow, best and worst of E3.
4741000	4742000	Loki?
4742000	4747500	I kind of have to agree with the Activision thing, just because I wish there was more
4747500	4750200	coverage of the Activision games.
4750200	4754400	To me, and you were mentioning BlizzCon and stuff, a lot of the stuff that Activision
4754400	4761880	does seems like a cash grab, and believe me, if they had thought about the whole charging
4761880	4767400	people for online play and when you buy a used game first, they would have been doing
4767400	4768880	it first.
4768880	4772280	And I have a feeling they're going to be following suit with that because they can make a lot
4772280	4775640	of money off of those Call of Duty games, Black Ops and whatnot.
4775640	4781660	Speaking of which, Black Ops looked fucking awesome, or no, it wasn't Black Ops, Future
4781660	4785360	Warrior actually, they were showing off the new Ghost Recon game, it looked awesome, and
4785360	4789960	the Ubisoft thing, I mean, really cool.
4789960	4794560	One of the best moments of E3 I think was when Kevin Butler came on stage and did his
4794560	4796360	like little rant.
4796360	4797900	That was actually really cool.
4797900	4799440	Completely scripted, well-acted rant.
4799440	4800440	I don't care.
4800440	4803800	He's a great actor, he's funny, you know.
4803800	4808320	I have no problems with, you know, I understand he's not a real, I mean, he's a real person
4808320	4811720	but he's playing, you know, this character, and that's fine.
4811720	4815840	I think it's a great, you know, advertising ploy.
4815840	4816840	So that was really cool.
4816840	4821360	You know what's funny, I was talking to Bobby about this one of the nights, and Shane was
4821360	4824240	probably there too, we were talking about this.
4824240	4828240	Many years ago here on the show, well maybe a couple years ago, I kind of said one of
4828240	4831920	the problems Sony's having right now is that they don't really have a good voice.
4831920	4837240	Xbox 360 has Major Nelson, Nintendo has Reggie Fils-Aime, but who does Sony have?
4837240	4841960	Sony has not really had a spokesperson, but they sure do now, don't they?
4841960	4843760	My how a lot has changed in a year.
4843760	4846760	It seems to me like the Stephen Colbert of the video game world.
4846760	4847760	I'm sorry.
4847760	4848760	Yes.
4848760	4851120	I need to retract my Activision thing.
4851120	4852960	Activision was not the worst part.
4852960	4855720	And sadly enough it does tie in with Kevin Butler.
4855720	4859120	Who the fuck is this new kid pimping out the PSP stuff?
4859120	4861800	He is so fucking annoying.
4861800	4865680	Why would you even have someone else handling that when you have Kevin Butler?
4865680	4870640	It's like, hey look, we have this fine caviar, but instead we're gonna serve you dog shit
4870640	4871640	on a plate.
4871640	4874080	I mean, why would you do that?
4874080	4878240	Why would you, you're going backwards, you took a big step backwards with this kid.
4878240	4882760	At the end of the day, they still eat crayons, Kevin Butler or not, remember that.
4882760	4883800	Sony's still eating crayons.
4883800	4886960	I understand, but seriously, what the hell?
4886960	4889880	Rob, you gotta admit, the kid wears the bicycle helmet.
4889880	4893440	And then they played like two commercials with him in it, and I'm like, stop.
4893440	4896080	I already hate him already.
4896080	4897080	And that's to be redundant.
4897080	4898080	SSJ100MattInOurChat.
4898080	4899080	That's terrible.
4899080	4900080	Exactly right.
4900080	4901080	Chat.
4901080	4905480	ThatOrangeLawnTrader.com says, seriously, think of the games they could have shown instead
4905480	4910200	of Kevin Butler's rant, but it was an epic time killing moment.
4910200	4913440	ToaGak believes that dog shit is actually better than caviar.
4913440	4916020	All right, fine.
4916020	4920860	We can serve you filet mignon, wrapped in bacon, the most delicious food you could possibly
4920860	4924240	ever have, or a steaming pile of dog shit.
4924240	4931040	In fact, we'll just put the dog over your face and he can shit straight into your mouth.
4931040	4933200	So it's absolutely fresh.
4933200	4935240	Loki, we get it.
4935240	4936240	God.
4936240	4938160	I don't think you do.
4938160	4940920	Well, I'm done with that.
4940920	4943240	This dog has been constipated forever.
4943240	4946960	Don't make me bring out the Dalek.
4946960	4948080	Dark Sakura, please.
4948080	4951600	The best thing about E3 for you and the worst thing about E3 for you.
4951600	4958000	It's a combination of getting my little bit of Portal 2 crack, because you know I've been
4958000	4959680	waiting for that.
4959680	4963600	And did they say anything about Half-Life 3?
4963600	4968400	That's what I wanted to ask.
4968400	4969400	You're funny.
4969400	4971580	Valve, acknowledging Half-Life.
4971580	4972580	That's funny.
4972580	4974680	No, they didn't.
4974680	4982040	Anyway, and the other good thing would be Kid Icarus with the 3DS.
4982040	4983420	So yay.
4983420	4987520	And the worst thing is there was no me there.
4987520	4988520	That was pretty awful.
4988520	4989520	I'm sorry.
4989520	4992720	So I couldn't have my Epic running into Kojima, but he wasn't there anyway.
4992720	4995000	That's why you couldn't go.
4995000	5001160	It's a constant in the universe that every E3 that I go to, I have to run into Kojima.
5001160	5003120	Literally.
5003120	5004840	And you know what else is kind of dumb?
5004840	5007120	Not quite the worst thing of E3.
5007120	5008680	What are they doing with the PSP?
5008680	5011120	Ooh, look, we have a new God of War game.
5011120	5012120	Props to you.
5012120	5013120	New God of War game.
5013120	5014120	Awesome.
5014120	5017440	They're still trying to kind of recover from that whole PSP Go debacle.
5017440	5020640	I think Sony's gonna save that PSP 2 for next year.
5020640	5023400	Guaranteed there'll be a PSP 2 next year.
5023400	5024400	They're gonna have to.
5024400	5025400	All right.
5025400	5027280	They can't lose by much more.
5027280	5031680	How about some release dates, because meanwhile while expos are going on, there's still games
5031680	5036800	coming to a store near you, and we probably should acknowledge some of the upcoming releases.
5036800	5042320	Yes, this week there's gonna be some Transformers.
5042320	5051340	The Cybertron Wars will be coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, the Wii, and of course two versions
5051340	5057760	on the DS, because they have to have one for every faction, and one on the PSP, one on
5057760	5059760	the PC.
5059760	5063080	Way too many Transformers, but that's fine.
5063080	5067320	Also this week, crappy DS games, including Western Riding Academy.
5067320	5071360	Awesome, because there's no horse riding games on the DS at all.
5071360	5077400	TNA Cross the Line, that's gonna be coming out on PSP and DS this week.
5077400	5083320	DS Sing, it's a karaoke game for the DS that comes with a microphone that plugs into your
5083320	5087040	DS, so you can look like a tool on the subway.
5087040	5092480	Ten Minute Solutions, coming from Activision, it's their fitness game based off a DVD exercise
5092480	5093480	series.
5093480	5099760	Wipeout, based off the, I guess it's a popular TV show on DS and Wii.
5099760	5100760	Thank you Activision.
5100760	5106840	Why can't they just have Takashi's Castle the game?
5106840	5113240	I mean, I know they did way back in the day, but a new one, that would be kind of cool.
5113240	5116440	Ah, the Wii, what junk you have.
5116440	5122880	Calvin Tucker's Redneck Racing on the Wii, from Zoo Games, thank you very much.
5122880	5130640	And some generic brain training games, Think Smart on DS, and then they also have Think
5130640	5137880	Smart Kids on DS, and then that's also on the Wii.
5137880	5144480	Let's see here, a couple more, Field and Stream, Total Outdoorsman Challenge on the Xbox 360,
5144480	5149320	Puzzle Quest 2 on the DS, and that's gonna be the old school Puzzle Quest game, none
5149320	5154600	of this crappy hexagon space Puzzle Quest crap.
5154600	5157200	Play that at the show, it has a lot of new mini games too.
5157200	5158200	Yes.
5158200	5162400	And finally, an actual game from Nintendo, and kind of a cult classic, or soon to be
5162400	5166200	a cult classic, Sin and Punishment Star Successor, coming out this week.
5166200	5168440	Get it now, until it's gone, before it's gone.
5168440	5169440	Yeah.
5169440	5170440	So, that's it.
5170440	5173480	If you want Nintendo to put out more titles like that, you might want to get it now.
5173480	5177400	Although it does look like, I mean Nintendo's got a lot of, I guess you could say hardcore,
5177400	5180320	quote unquote, games coming out for the rest of the year.
5180320	5183560	Okay, some of the other games coming out in Japan.
5183560	5186880	Big Week in Japan with this release, because I think this is definitely one we want to
5186880	5189800	keep an eye on, because this looks like a pretty awesome game.
5189800	5195200	Monster Hunter Frontier Online is coming out from Capcom in Japan on the Xbox 360 this
5195200	5197360	week, so yes it is an online adventure.
5197360	5201120	I would probably stop short of saying MMO, but you're gonna have 11 different types
5201120	5206520	of weapons, and you'll be able to use the Xbox 360 live, basically, to go into a plaza,
5206520	5208360	chat with other hunters for tips.
5208360	5212360	Capcom's gonna be regularly updating the game, so keep an eye on that one.
5212360	5215940	I bet if anybody's importing a game, that would be one of them.
5215940	5220240	Sengoku Hime 2 is also coming out this week from SystemSoft, a little strategy game there
5220240	5225440	featuring anime characters, that's a lot of the games in Japan end up being.
5225440	5229640	There's also, by the way, a special new keyboard coming out for the Xbox 360 Monster Hunter
5229640	5232680	game, so keep a look out for that.
5232680	5236160	In other Japanese release dates, there are some games coming out on the Playstation 3
5236160	5237160	as well.
5237160	5243260	There's a game called White Album, Susarariu Fuyu no Omoide is coming out, and this is
5243260	5245640	an adventure game.
5245640	5249520	Basically your idol is your girlfriend, and the more popular she becomes, the less time
5249520	5251720	she has for you.
5251720	5256560	That's basically the plot of the game, conflicts, fight with your girlfriend, the game is basically
5256560	5257560	what this is.
5257560	5258560	So...
5258560	5259560	Why would I buy a game?
5259560	5263120	It's funny, if you buy a game like that, you might actually start the real life version
5263120	5265800	of the game.
5265800	5272000	Also a game coming out over there, Tottori no Atelier, Arland no Reckon Jushuchi 2 comes
5272000	5273000	out.
5273000	5278760	It's a sequel to Rona no Atelier, it takes place 10 years after that, it's an RPG.
5278760	5282760	You have, you know, synthesis and go on swashbuckling adventures, etc. etc.
5282760	5286440	It's a JRPG, in its finest.
5286440	5292480	Going over to the Nintendo Wii, SD Gundam Gashapon Wars comes out this week.
5292480	5294960	Aw, I love SD Gundam, they're so cute.
5294960	5298640	There's also a version coming out with a classic controller, it should be stated, so check
5298640	5299640	that out.
5299640	5302640	By the way, Goldeneye, I played completely on a classic controller, that's how they were
5302640	5303640	demoing it.
5303640	5306560	I meant to get that out at some point.
5306560	5310740	You don't have to use motion control at all in Goldeneye, the way it should be.
5310740	5315640	On the Nintendo DS this week in Japan, Love Plus comes out this week, and there's like
5315640	5320440	all these little play stands and things coming out to support it, but that's what it's called,
5320440	5323520	it's called Love Plus.
5323520	5329480	It's like a experienced school, and you go on vacations and mountain climbing with three
5329480	5332720	girls and you date, it's another dating sim, okay guys?
5332720	5337680	It's the one that's, you know, it's basically a sequel to the one that was like, you know,
5337680	5339880	where the guy married the character in a bagel.
5339880	5341680	Yes, it is, it is that same series.
5341680	5347560	Also, if that's not enough for you, Tokimeki Memorial Girls' Side, third story, so if Love
5347560	5353240	Plus is not for you, maybe you want to play the girls' side.
5353240	5356520	It's basically where you are now the female lead and you're trying to get a boyfriend
5356520	5358280	before graduation.
5358280	5360660	So I like that, that they're both coming out the same week.
5360660	5364680	You know, Rob, I have a laserdisc of Tokimeki Memorial OAV.
5364680	5365680	Really?
5365680	5369960	Yeah, and I bought it because it had a big Konami logo on it.
5369960	5371520	Fun.
5371520	5374480	That really pretty much does it for release dates.
5374480	5376320	I'm looking at the Sony PSP.
5376320	5381320	I guess I should say Hatsune Miku Project Diva is coming out this week.
5381320	5383080	I think this has been covered on a previous show.
5383080	5384080	It is a rhythm game.
5384080	5387600	There's a number of people in the chatroom who have been all kinds of hyper about getting
5387600	5388600	it too.
5388600	5389600	Yeah, so...
5389600	5390600	It's the Vocaloid.
5390600	5393200	It's the Sega rhythm game, so I bet there's some people...
5393200	5394200	But you...
5394200	5395200	Oh, you know what it is?
5395200	5396200	I'm sorry.
5396200	5397200	It's a price reduction.
5397200	5398200	It's not the initial release.
5398200	5400720	But you know who Hatsune Miku is?
5400720	5401720	The Vocaloid.
5401720	5407320	You know, remember sending you all those videos of the electronic girl voice singing?
5407320	5408320	Yeah, I do.
5408320	5409320	That's her.
5409320	5413840	Chaos Head Noah is the last game I'm going to mention this week, also on the PSP.
5413840	5417400	That's an adventure game that's coming out there on the PSP in Japan.
5417400	5420120	All right, DarkSakura, how about the Old Kingdom?
5420120	5424240	Well, um, eh.
5424240	5425240	That's my official answer.
5425240	5427480	No, um, we've got a number of things.
5427480	5432640	On the 23rd, we have Land Bandit and Puzzle Quest 2.
5432640	5434960	Excuse me.
5434960	5443040	And on the 25th, we have Armada 2526, Backbreaker, Demon's Souls, Lego Harry Potter Years 1-4,
5443040	5447560	Naughty Bear, that just sounds like a bedroom nickname.
5447560	5450320	Someone's been a naughty bear.
5450320	5457320	Singularity, Transformers War for Cybertron, and that is it for this week.
5457320	5458320	All right.
5458320	5463080	That's going to do it for release dates for right now.
5463080	5464080	What's that?
5464080	5465080	Are you a naughty bear?
5465080	5466080	I'm a very naughty bear.
5466080	5470520	YYR in our chatroom, I love this, talking about Love Plus, although AlphaKananagram is
5470520	5471520	saying it's Love Plus Plus.
5471520	5473520	Hey, I just read it like it was written, okay?
5473520	5477320	YYR says, uh, I'll be waiting for the depressing sequel, Love Minus.
5477320	5480200	It takes place after all the girls dump the main character's sorry ass.
5480200	5482760	There you go, that's the real game right there.
5482760	5487040	Chat.orangeacollegenity.com if you want to join in the fun.
5487040	5488600	It's such a weird game.
5488600	5489600	Yeah.
5489600	5492560	Uh, at least you don't poke witches in it.
5492560	5502400	Um, so E3 of course was pretty big, and there was 45,600 attendees, and next year you can
5502400	5506000	expect E3 to be coming out slightly earlier.
5506000	5510360	June 7th through the 9th, it will be also at the LA Convention Center, and of course
5510360	5514160	they're expecting probably an even bigger turnout for that as well.
5514160	5515160	So.
5515160	5516160	Alrighty.
5516160	5520520	300 exhibitors this year as well.
5520520	5522840	You know what though, the show's starting to get a little big.
5522840	5528740	Like I, that was oddly worded the way I said, but I mean, I don't want it to get as big
5528740	5532880	as it was in 2006, especially when Kensha Hall is now a parking lot, which is what they
5532880	5534880	use Kensha Hall for now, by the way, just so you know.
5534880	5535880	It's a parking lot?
5535880	5538160	Yes, it's a parking lot, people park their cars in there.
5538160	5539160	In the hall?
5539160	5540160	In the hall.
5540160	5541160	When did that get dirty?
5541160	5543720	Uh, I think the floor is probably removable.
5543720	5546920	They can do that now.
5546920	5549960	I'm not kidding, when I went down there to use the bathroom at one point, I looked in
5549960	5551400	the doors, there's all these cars parked in there.
5551400	5555240	I don't know if it was the exhibitors or what, but that's what they use Kensha Hall for now.
5555240	5556240	Weird.
5556240	5560560	Well, you know what, this is a good story for us to kind of sort of end on here on this
5560560	5565160	part A, and that is that, you know, the news doesn't stop just because E3 is over, and
5565160	5571200	apparently Hideo Kojima is, and they were saying he was at E3 this week, showing off
5571200	5572680	Metal Gear Solid Rising.
5572680	5573680	But.
5573680	5574920	He was at the press conference.
5574920	5575920	Yeah.
5575920	5582200	Apparently, he is sitting on a massive PS3 exclusive that was not ready to show at E3.
5582200	5584920	They're going to show it at Tokyo Game Show.
5584920	5587260	So don't forget, the news does not end at E3.
5587260	5591040	There are still other expos that people are going to show their big news.
5591040	5596120	This is coming from a CVG, computer and video game source, that apparently there is a PlayStation
5596120	5600820	3 exclusive that is supposed to, quote, own the show in Tokyo.
5600820	5605700	They really wanted to have it ready for E3, but it unfortunately just was not ready.
5605700	5609280	And maybe they didn't want to steal the thunder from Metal Gear Solid Rising anyway.
5609280	5611120	No idea what it could be.
5611120	5614720	Could it be an existing Kojima series like Boktai?
5614720	5615720	Probably not.
5615720	5616720	Zone of the Enders?
5616720	5617720	I somehow doubt that too.
5617720	5618720	Yeah.
5618720	5621480	I think this is probably going to be a whole new thing.
5621480	5623720	Or maybe another just Metal Gear Solid game.
5623720	5624720	Nah.
5624720	5625720	Probably not that.
5625720	5626720	I think it'll be an all new Kojima game.
5626720	5627720	But we'll see.
5627720	5630600	Metal Gear Solid move party.
5630600	5633640	Snake party!
5633640	5634640	Oh wait.
5634640	5635640	That sounds bad.
5635640	5639840	Alright, well we can't end part A here at Orange Lounge Radio without doing a segment
5639840	5642240	we love here at Orange Lounge Radio.
5642240	5643800	The classic game of the week.
5643800	5647960	It's a chance for Dark Sakura to go in the gaming vault and say, hey!
5647960	5651880	I know you people have been playing all these newfangled games and been re-nup on these
5651880	5657240	3D systems, these Microsoft flails and all this stuff, but you know what?
5657240	5659440	Don't forget your roots, kids.
5659440	5663040	Here's a classic video game you bitches should be playing, right Dark Sakura?
5663040	5664040	Yes.
5664040	5666640	This is a game that I love.
5666640	5670120	Alright, what is the classic video game of the week, Dark Sakura?
5670120	5678560	This is a game that was for the PC Engine Super CD called Silphia.
5678560	5680040	Silphia?
5680040	5686960	Yeah, and I had to go to different sources to find more information about it because
5686960	5691640	I haven't played the game for a little while myself, but it's a fun little shooter.
5691640	5695920	It's a 2D shooter set in mythological Greece.
5695920	5702440	You have a ton of extra lives and you get a special attack called the Giga Fairy Beam.
5702440	5703440	Fairy Beam?
5703440	5706240	Yes, because you play as a fairy.
5706240	5708560	You're a fairy.
5708560	5714520	It's not really one of the greatest games because it's really not super challenging,
5714520	5719640	but it's just really, really nice.
5719640	5732400	You start off with this woman warrior who dies protecting Athena's temple and so she
5732400	5748360	turns into a Silphia so she can go and basically stop all the people who tried to hurt all
5748360	5750640	of them, so it's sort of the main story.
5750640	5755520	Anyway, you fly around and you get power-ups.
5755520	5764440	Your power-ups are bee icons and you have different bosses you fight.
5764440	5771840	One's a colossus and one is, I believe, that you fight a gorgon in one level too.
5771840	5779600	Like that one, you're fighting this big demon thing that takes off his head, I think.
5779600	5785360	It really goes for things from different Greek mythology.
5785360	5789920	You have a flying chariot that's pulled by manticores.
5789920	5795120	It's pretty fun, pretty flight of fancy sort of game.
5795120	5799160	It is put out by Compile and Compile has brought out a lot of good games.
5799160	5801680	There's your reason right there to play it, honestly.
5801680	5808520	That's the people who did the Guardian Legend, need I say more.
5808520	5811640	It's pricey to try to find a copy of it now.
5811640	5813080	It really is.
5813080	5816680	I have a copy.
5816680	5822280	It goes for about $100 average on eBay, but it's a really good game, really fun.
5822280	5826600	I would say, for those of you out there who've got Magic Engine, get a disc image of it and
5826600	5830040	give it a go and then fork out $100, see if you like it.
5830040	5833560	You know what this reminds me of a little bit is Legendary Wings, just in looking at
5833560	5836440	it, kind of, but cute.
5836440	5839600	This robo monster she's fighting right now has ginormous tits.
5839600	5840600	Yeah.
5840600	5841600	Look at that.
5841600	5842600	Since I have a golem, I think.
5842600	5847480	Give me a little bra, perverts, but too bad about that Medusa head.
5847480	5848480	Yeah.
5848480	5850640	All right, there it is.
5850640	5855200	That's the one thing I also wanted to point out too, is that your attack can go directional
5855200	5857560	based on proximity.
5857560	5858560	Very cool.
5858560	5864360	It is, it makes fighting the bosses a little bit more dynamic than your average 2D shooter.
5864360	5870800	Your classic game of the week for the PC Engine, a compile classic, Sylvia is the classic game
5870800	5871800	of the week.
5871800	5876480	A game so crazy rare, Dark Sakura had to really scour the web to find more information on
5876480	5877480	it.
5877480	5880100	All right, that's going to do it for your classic video game of the week.
5880100	5882280	We have plenty more to come here at Orange Lounge Radio.
5882280	5885360	You know, there's a lot of news that still kind of happened that was little things that
5885360	5889000	happened at E3, and we're going to talk all about that when we come back in Part B. Also,
5889000	5892560	I need to talk about the big battle, because I didn't mention that in Part A, because E3
5892560	5894860	was going on, but I want to mention a little bit more about that.
5894860	5896080	We got the mailbag.
5896080	5900480	We got the Twitter topics, and all that other fun stuff coming right back at you when we
5900480	5910080	come right back here on more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5910080	5912800	And welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.
5912800	5919400	We are live with our 371st episode on this June the 20th of 2010, where we are taping
5919400	5925040	live, of course, as we do every Sunday night at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.
5925040	5929640	Speaking of All Games, amongst all the E3 madness, I nearly neglected to mention this,
5929640	5933040	and I definitely wanted to mention this at some point tonight, but this has been kind
5933040	5937680	of building for a couple weeks here, and that is the Big Battle, which is a competition
5937680	5940920	between several of the shows on the All Games Network.
5940920	5942240	It is not the host.
5942240	5945360	It's the listeners that actually are going to be doing some of the competing in these
5945360	5946360	games.
5946360	5949200	And there's still more games to be announced.
5949200	5954440	Think of it as like a gaming Olympics, and you can get all the information at thebigbattle.net.
5954440	5956920	I think also bigbattle.allgames.com works.
5956920	5959520	It really doesn't matter which one you use, but definitely check out that site.
5959520	5963720	I'm going to go ahead and copy paste that link into our chat room right now at chat
5963720	5968480	room.orangeloungeradio.com, so you can sign up to represent OLR, because we're only the
5968480	5970680	second largest team on there right now.
5970680	5974680	And I don't think we can really rest until we're the largest team being represented in
5974680	5975680	the Big Battle.
5975680	5978160	But then we actually have to win some of the competitions, too.
5978160	5984520	And really wrapping up soon, Battlefield Bad Company 2 and Soldner X2.
5984520	5986440	Both of those battles wrapping up very soon.
5986440	5991080	I believe there's going to be a live Battlefield competition on the 26th, and then Soldner
5991080	5995440	X2 is basically get the highest score you can in the next week.
5995440	5999040	But I will say some new competitions were added, because we got a lot of Twitter feedback
5999040	6002920	when we first announced the Big Battle, like, well, where are the games that I own?
6002920	6003920	I don't own those games.
6003920	6005520	Well, remember, guys, it's like the Olympics.
6005520	6009040	There's going to be more and more games that are added as this event goes on.
6009040	6013480	And some of the new games that were added, Pinball, that's right, Zen Pinball and Pinball
6013480	6014480	FX.
6014480	6018680	So you can play the Earth Defense Force table for a high score in Zen Pinball, or you can
6018680	6022120	play Pinball FX, the Buccier table on the 360.
6022120	6025960	Both those events end on July 9th, and more information is available on thebigbattle.net.
6025960	6027680	And it's just high score.
6027680	6031420	And if we get the highest score, then our team gets, like, 10 points, and that's great.
6031420	6035040	So everybody should sign up and just get the highest score you can.
6035040	6038800	And we're going to show all these other all-game shows that were much more than just the music
6038800	6042640	games and all that fun stuff, that we can bring it to the table on some of these other
6042640	6043640	games too.
6043640	6044640	So it'll be fun.
6044640	6045640	So check that out again.
6045640	6051440	One more time, thebigbattle.net, and we'll bring you the results for Soldner X2 and Battlefield
6051440	6053760	Bad Company 2, hopefully for next week's show.
6053760	6058800	Hopefully the folks behind the all-games radio Big Battle will be able to get those results
6058800	6061800	to me soon.
6061800	6066440	Moving on with show stuff, we're going to do some rapid-fire news here in Part B and
6066440	6067800	then get to the Twitter topics.
6067800	6071640	So if you still need to get your Twitter topics in, you have just a few more minutes.
6071640	6075640	Alright, Loki, why don't you start us off with some of the stuff that may be a missed
6075640	6081720	at E3 amongst all these 3DSs and Valve on PlayStation and all this other stuff that
6081720	6083080	was going on.
6083080	6084080	This is kind of neat.
6084080	6088920	Secret of Mana is coming to the iPhone later this year.
6088920	6092160	Basically going to be a port of the SNES game.
6092160	6097380	And they didn't really say when exactly it's going to be ported over, but sometime in 2010.
6097380	6101080	So keep on looking out for that one.
6101080	6104400	Also, by the way, just because I noticed it's not mentioned here, Final Fantasy Tactics
6104400	6107020	is also in that same boat.
6107020	6108480	Very cool.
6108480	6112480	Another game coming to the iPhone is Bit.Trip Beat.
6112480	6115800	That's going to be coming out as well.
6115800	6120760	No word on exactly when that is, but it is coming out soon.
6120760	6121760	So that's kind of cool.
6121760	6130440	They're going to use, I guess, the tilt controls to move the paddle in just like the Wii version.
6130440	6137680	Scott Pilgrim vs. The World is getting kind of an arcade game.
6137680	6144360	It's going to be exclusive on the PlayStation Network for a certain period of time.
6144360	6146960	It will be coming out August 10th.
6146960	6154960	And of course, this game looks absolutely amazing and really I don't understand why
6154960	6161040	people before when I was posting that we should do, what was it, remember we had that list
6161040	6165080	list or whatever for the versus games and I picked a really obscure reference to the
6165080	6171840	guy that did the, you know, King of 9 billion percent or whatever.
6171840	6172840	Yes.
6172840	6173840	Yes.
6173840	6174840	I do remember that.
6174840	6175840	Yes.
6175840	6176840	That was many weeks ago.
6176840	6177840	That's the guy that animated this game.
6177840	6178840	Oh wow.
6178840	6179840	Okay.
6179840	6180840	And it looks freaking awesome.
6180840	6183280	I don't remember the guy's name, but I'm sure the chat room will figure that out.
6183280	6185960	But it looks awesome.
6185960	6192080	Like I actually think about, I may pick this up on the PlayStation Network maybe if I have
6192080	6196880	the patience, I guess I could wait, but it looks so cool.
6196880	6200040	Who did that?
6200040	6206360	I'm trying to remember now.
6206360	6207360	I don't remember.
6207360	6210360	I'll look it up and chime in later.
6210360	6212880	And then let's see here.
6212880	6219080	Last thing, rock band stuff coming out this week because yes, unlike certain other music
6219080	6223200	game platforms, they actually do have stuff that comes out every single week.
6223200	6225760	Not always good though.
6225760	6231360	This week we will be getting the Miley Cyrus pack number one, which means I guess there's
6231360	6233600	going to be more than one later on.
6233600	6239080	Included in that will be a few Miley Cyrus tracks, including 7 Things, Can't Be Tamed,
6239080	6244080	Fly on the Wall, See You Again, and Start All Over.
6244080	6250400	Those are each available for $2 or the equivalent in your fictional points, and the whole pack
6250400	6252920	will be available for 680 Microsoft points.
6252920	6257200	I have no idea what that translates to in real world money, but I can guarantee it's
6257200	6260960	going to be slightly cheaper than buying them all separate if you're really going to buy
6260960	6264640	them all separate, or if you were even going to buy them at all.
6264640	6270040	Those will be available June 22nd.
6270040	6272920	I thought the listeners would appreciate a little taste of Miley Cyrus there.
6272920	6275760	She's more talented than her dad.
6275760	6279800	She's always important to her grandmother.
6279800	6280800	Really?
6280800	6281800	Yeah.
6281800	6283680	I have a funny story about this.
6283680	6284680	Can I tell it real quick?
6284680	6285680	Tell them.
6285680	6290920	I was admiring the wall of songs that they had at the harmonics booth, and one of the
6290920	6294240	gals that worked for harmonics kind of caught me looking at it and said, yeah, it's an impressive
6294240	6295240	list, huh?
6295240	6297400	And I said, you know, it could really use some more Lady Gaga.
6297400	6300160	You know, I was just kind of joking, right?
6300160	6303080	And she said, well, you better stay tuned for next week.
6303080	6304360	She says, there won't be Lady Gaga.
6304360	6308400	I can't tell you who it is yet, but there's definitely a lady coming to X, Y, she was
6308400	6309400	talking about Miley Cyrus.
6309400	6313080	I kind of want to go back and find her and say, that's not what I meant.
6313080	6314680	Or you want to punch her in the face?
6314680	6316160	No, she was nice.
6316160	6319980	I don't want to punch her in the face, but I just want to, I just want to set her straight.
6319980	6326760	The Miley Cyrus is not, not, not the same as Lady Gaga.
6326760	6328760	Thank you.
6328760	6337240	And, uh, the, the person that I was looking for that, uh, did the, um, Scott Pilgrim game,
6337240	6343280	Paul Robertson, he's the guy doing the sprites and that guy can animate like nothing else.
6343280	6344920	It is one sexy looking game.
6344920	6351520	And if that's not cool enough, uh, apparently there's a chiptune rock band, uh, on a Monoguchi
6351520	6354520	that's going to be, uh, providing the soundtrack for the game.
6354520	6357240	So seriously, pick it up.
6357240	6362880	If you have to wait for it to come out and, uh, Xbox live, then fine.
6362880	6365720	By the way, can I read some of the, uh, chat room comments here?
6365720	6368680	Uh, Toa Gak says, fucking shit, Sky, turn it off.
6368680	6373920	The doctor 4945 says my achy breaky ears, uh, shadow runner says, Sky, you just blew
6373920	6375960	out my eardrum with that god awful music.
6375960	6376960	Thanks JK.
6376960	6377960	Lulz.
6377960	6378960	There you go.
6378960	6384000	So our chat room, always appreciative of the antics here at orange lounge radio, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
6384000	6389680	If you want to, uh, yell at me for playing certain songs on the air, uh, going over to
6389680	6391120	some other quick news.
6391120	6396200	This might've been the game of the show, uh, for Loki had he gone, uh, hello Kitty seasons
6396200	6397380	is coming to the Wii.
6397380	6398380	That's right.
6398380	6399380	Finally.
6399380	6400380	Hello Kitty is getting a Wii game.
6400380	6403400	I believe she had a game cube game, but now she's getting a Wii game.
6403400	6405760	Hello Kitty seasons will be on the Wii this holiday.
6405760	6407480	Um, I don't really know what it's about.
6407480	6411280	I think it's a puzzle game, but does anyone really fucking care?
6411280	6414360	I know Loki cares, but I'll send him the link so you can read it offline.
6414360	6417360	I bought kitty the cool so you could play it.
6417360	6422000	By the way, if you were thinking of picking one of these up, not hello kitty, but a, uh,
6422000	6426520	Microsoft racing wheel, you might want to get that now because, uh, mad cats is saying
6426520	6430320	that, uh, Microsoft will no longer be having them produce this.
6430320	6435440	Uh, they really had to kind of carefully say this, but they were saying, you're going to
6435440	6437880	have to check with Microsoft for further information.
6437880	6442640	Uh, but it's mad cat's understanding that Microsoft is exiting the wheel market.
6442640	6444600	That was from mad cat's PR manager.
6444600	6449480	And obviously I can see why with, uh, the tall connect, whatever you want to call it
6449480	6450480	coming out soon.
6450480	6454840	Uh, they want to just not have, I bought one of those, um, to use with my arcade cabinet
6454840	6460280	actually cause I have one of those wireless adapters for the, uh, 360 controls.
6460280	6463160	I love my 360 controller for PC games.
6463160	6468280	Like I use it with crisis and I use it with grand theft auto on there, um, I haven't tried
6468280	6474640	the racing wheel yet with actual, any actual games, but I can't wait to use it for like,
6474640	6479860	you know, driving games on mame, uh, dark Tetsuya in our chat room says at least Miley
6479860	6480860	likes hello kitty.
6480860	6483520	Just going to that last story, tying things together.
6483520	6484520	I like that.
6484520	6485520	Oh yes.
6485520	6486520	Um, more quick things.
6486520	6489760	Oh, to medias, uh, is, uh, coming out for the X-Box three 60.
6489760	6495600	I was not on the show floor, uh, but it was quickly announced it, um, Konami's press conference
6495600	6499680	that auto medias is going to come out, uh, on the X-Box three 60 that's right here in
6499680	6500680	North America.
6500680	6504200	Um, and I believe, what is this hot booby action in this game a little bit, right?
6504200	6505200	Right.
6505200	6506200	He is with boobies.
6506200	6507200	Yay.
6507200	6509320	So if you like Gradius and if you like boobies, then this game will be for you.
6509320	6513960	And it's a sequel to the Gradius booby game that was on, um, the Japanese three 60.
6513960	6514960	That's right.
6514960	6515960	Cause this is called auto medias.
6515960	6516960	Excellent.
6516960	6517960	So it's actually like kind of like a sequel.
6517960	6519960	It's no auto medias gorgeous.
6519960	6520960	No gorgeous was the original.
6520960	6521960	Sorry.
6521960	6522960	Excellence is.
6522960	6523960	Oh, okay.
6523960	6524960	Sequel, whatever.
6524960	6525960	Boobs and Gradius.
6525960	6526960	That's what they should just call the game.
6526960	6535280	Boobs and Gradius gratuitous booby is, um, our friends, buddy pals at bamani style.com
6535280	6541040	had actually a little interview with Naoki Medea at E3 asking about some of the hard
6541040	6543840	questions about what the hell happened to DDR.
6543840	6548440	Um, basically Naoki has said that his team is separated from the bamani team.
6548440	6552560	Uh, he's saying that basically the U S has seen many more music games and his team wanted
6552560	6554720	to focus on new experiences.
6554720	6559400	Uh, basically in nutshell, they kind of danced around the, uh, question about what happened
6559400	6560400	to the DDR games.
6560400	6562000	They were not shown at E3.
6562000	6565480	The Wii one was, but the new ones on three 60 and PS3 weren't.
6565480	6569440	And basically it was basically said, they're not really wanting to show them yet.
6569440	6574360	Um, so, uh, some of the other things that had come up was, uh, they called out the direct
6574360	6576680	comparison to the power of heart ice series.
6576680	6578800	And now he said, yes, I did some work on that.
6578800	6581720	Uh, but my team is no longer a part of the money.
6581720	6584000	So dance masters is not able money game.
6584000	6586160	That's something important to point out.
6586160	6587160	Hmm.
6587160	6591640	Uh, they also said we have professional dancers and choreographers from all over the world,
6591640	6593640	creating routines for dance masters.
6593640	6598320	So I'm hoping with that in mind, that they are actually doing different styles of dance
6598320	6605360	and it's not just the Para stuff that perhaps the Para stuff was able to be finished first
6605360	6609760	because you know, maybe they either have the motion capture data for it, or they already
6609760	6612320	have routines down for that kind of stuff.
6612320	6613320	I'm hoping.
6613320	6617840	I also thought this was interesting and I really hope Naoki, um, means this when he
6617840	6621440	says this, uh, he was asked a question by Bimani style about, uh, given that you've
6621440	6624260	worked on all these different types of games, do you think that peripheral based games have
6624260	6625880	a strong future in America?
6625880	6630220	And he says, okay, at Konami, we did Guitar Freak, StrawMania, 2DX, DDR, and these games
6630220	6633600	made the app, created the atmosphere of playing an instrument or dancing.
6633600	6638200	And then in America, rock band, DJ hero, guitar hero made it feel more real while still being
6638200	6639360	a game.
6639360	6643200	We are trying to create an even more real experience while still being the most fun
6643200	6644200	possible.
6644200	6645600	So we would like to be flexible.
6645600	6648240	Here's the part I think you should pay special attention to.
6648240	6653840	We would also like to collaborate in the future with famous producers and musicians to make
6653840	6661200	music exclusively for our games, which I think is a good idea.
6661200	6662520	I think that's a great idea.
6662520	6664520	So we'll see if that actually pans out.
6664520	6670700	Arguably, um, the game, you know, DDR, some of the best music in DDR was the music coming
6670700	6671700	from Konami.
6671700	6673640	So it makes sense.
6673640	6674640	All right.
6674640	6679100	How about some Twitter topics you guys, should we go to Twitter and see what the listeners
6679100	6681320	are showing us on their tweets?
6681320	6685560	By the way, if you want to show us your tweets, all you have to do is follow O L R on Twitter
6685560	6689040	at twitter.com slash O L R and you can send us our tweets.
6689040	6692720	We always say, Hey, you guys have a few minutes to get those topics in, uh, for what everyone
6692720	6693720	to talk about.
6693720	6696800	Keep in mind, I'm not going to read every tweet we get because sometimes you guys link
6696800	6698980	to stories that are going to come up a little later in the show.
6698980	6700800	So it's not because I don't like you.
6700800	6701800	I promise.
6701800	6703400	Uh, let's see.
6703400	6708000	Um, I thought this was an interesting link here from tiger claw three Oh five on Twitter
6708000	6711300	is sending us this Sony downplays the three DS.
6711300	6715160	Because you know, Sony, Sony was trying to show a lot of three D at their conference
6715160	6716160	too.
6716160	6718800	And then Nintendo just kind of came out and said, well, you don't need glasses for ours.
6718800	6719800	Uh huh.
6719800	6720800	So here it is.
6720800	6725000	Uh, Sony, it kind of a downplay this a little bit cast her eyes specifically.
6725000	6731220	He said, quote, based off internally conducted research, naked eye, three D for portables
6731220	6733720	does not have high precision.
6733720	6736400	And at present there are limitations.
6736400	6742400	He would not comment on the three DS itself, however, because he had not yet seen the system.
6742400	6745360	Here's the problem, Mr. Her eye.
6745360	6748240	They've got the games to back it up.
6748240	6752260	Whereas I dunno, I guess I should say some of the games that sound like they're a pretty
6752260	6758340	awesome on them, the Sony, uh, uh, three D experience sound pretty cool, but the move
6758340	6760400	I'm a little less excited about.
6760400	6765160	It's just that they, I mean, when they come up with him with questions like that, what's
6765160	6766160	he going to say?
6766160	6767160	Whoa.
6767160	6768160	That's amazing.
6768160	6769160	Wish we had thought of that.
6769160	6773440	You know, I mean, he's obviously going to try to put something Microsoft and Nintendo
6773440	6778640	up until connect was announced, was kind of trading these little like, you know, hearts
6778640	6780040	for each other.
6780040	6784800	You know, they used to kind of compliment each other until Microsoft decided they were
6784800	6787920	not going to have any of this competition anymore and go right after it.
6787920	6790320	It's been fun playing with you, but now you must die.
6790320	6791320	Exactly.
6791320	6796800	Dark Tetsuya links us to a story where apparently Reggie has said, you know, maybe young kids
6796800	6802320	should probably not play the three DS, but he actually means very young children.
6802320	6805460	We recommend that very young children not look at the three D images.
6805460	6809520	That's because in young children, the muscles for the eyes are not fully formed.
6809520	6812860	This is the same messaging that the industry is putting out with three D movies.
6812860	6814240	So it is a standard protocol.
6814240	6818160	We have the same type of messaging for the virtual boy as an example.
6818160	6823440	I tend to make my baby cross-eyed seven years or older.
6823440	6826920	According to Reggie fees and may, I would be very, again, I think the disclaimers on
6826920	6830240	this thing are going to be a mile long.
6830240	6834940	Alpha Kana gram is saying CH children of eat or chart child of Eden three DS.
6834940	6835940	Good idea.
6835940	6836940	Am I right?
6836940	6837940	I mean, it would look cool on three DS.
6837940	6839480	It's from alpha Kana gram.
6839480	6843600	Uh, that might be too much going on.
6843600	6847400	That might be too much for the eyes, but it would be, yeah, it'd be a little tough.
6847400	6851760	I think something that's more wireframe like rez would lend itself a little easier to the
6851760	6855040	three D stuff than maybe child of Eden.
6855040	6858880	I would like to see a rez three D port, you know, something we didn't talk a lot about,
6858880	6862920	but there's an, I apologize if I'm, I'm mentioning a story that's coming up, but there's hella
6862920	6866040	hella ports being planned for the DS.
6866040	6869760	Like, you know, if you think it was bad, all the stuff that's coming out now, man, they
6869760	6871400	want to go back and do all these games.
6871400	6876000	One of the games I played on the three DS was the old shooter, old shooter by Namco
6876000	6877800	Xevious.
6877800	6878800	That's a great game.
6878800	6881400	And it was three D. That's fantastic.
6881400	6884120	And there's all these other old school three D games are going to go back and do.
6884120	6888000	You probably heard about ocarina of time and I guess there's this list somewhere that details
6888000	6893120	all these games that into no one's to do in three D. So those are actually, they're not
6893120	6894280	games that they want to do.
6894280	6895720	They're in development already.
6895720	6896720	Geez.
6896720	6901120	Bob, what my brain just did something weird.
6901120	6905480	It combined ocarina of time with weird Al doing the soundtrack.
6905480	6910400	What the poker arena of time, that'd be the greatest thing ever.
6910400	6911400	That was so strange.
6911400	6912400	All right.
6912400	6913400	I had to share that.
6913400	6914920	It just popped into my head.
6914920	6915920	Seriously.
6915920	6916920	Weird Al game.
6916920	6918320	Where is it?
6918320	6923160	There has not been a weird Al game and Gallagher had a video game.
6923160	6928040	That is just blasphemy that there has been no weird Al video game.
6928040	6933200	And also I want to say I am also very disappointed with TV being the way it is nowadays.
6933200	6939200	We should really seriously have our own UHF channel by now.
6939200	6942720	Ray Iannami, oops sorry that was a retweet not a question.
6942720	6946440	Richard Zard says I'm very upset I cannot meet up with you at E3.
6946440	6948840	I tried to meet up with you at E3 but that didn't go so well.
6948840	6952200	I was really looking forward to meeting you after three years of listening.
6952200	6956700	Well unfortunately E3 is probably like the worst possible place to do a meetup because
6956700	6961560	there's so much going on at E3.
6961560	6963840	You know unfortunately it doesn't lend itself as well to meetups.
6963840	6967800	It's like things like PAX and so forth and you know we were just there was just too much
6967800	6969120	going on.
6969120	6973520	But honestly I didn't know there was an interest beforehand for folks to kind of want to meet
6973520	6974520	up.
6974520	6978280	I didn't think enough of our listeners really went to the show but now that I know there
6978280	6982440	are some I guess next year maybe we'll plan like a dinner one night or something we could
6982440	6983440	probably do.
6983440	6988080	But just on the show floor is just really like the worst possible place to have you
6988080	6991880	know OLR reunions and so forth.
6991880	6997360	SGA 100 Matt is asking us out of all the E3's you guys slash gal have gone to which is your
6997360	7004680	fave worst and where does this one stack up to those?
7004680	7009960	Easy my favorite was my first one because you never forget your first and that was also
7009960	7015080	the year we met like a Kiryamoka and I had like the Silent Hill set up and it was a cool
7015080	7016080	year.
7016080	7017080	The room.
7017080	7022320	And then later also Bamani or I'm sorry 2DX was announced for America right or maybe that
7022320	7023320	was the next year.
7023320	7024320	No that was.
7024320	7026280	We had the distorted the second year I think.
7026280	7027760	Oh maybe that's right.
7027760	7031520	And the karaoke revolution country.
7031520	7037760	My least favorite year was 2006 the year right before the break because that was year where
7037760	7042440	Paris Hilton had a line going around there's just too damn many people at E3 and it kind
7042440	7044740	of became a little bit of a joke.
7044740	7050100	And then this year would be my second favorite E3 I felt that I just I got to do so much
7050100	7055600	this year that I hadn't done in years past and I was keeping myself so busy with stuff
7055600	7058640	that I was very pleased with the show this year and I think there was just a lot of good
7058640	7062600	tech to see because I don't think last year's show was very good either that would probably
7062600	7065800	be my second least favorite show next to the 06 show.
7065800	7072440	So I would rank them 04, 10, 05, 09, 06.
7072440	7078080	Well I can't really rank any of mine I mean there's good experiences and bad experiences
7078080	7081720	and not all of them I link with the convention itself.
7081720	7092480	So I would say I think that I really did like 2006 just because I got in a ton of awesome
7092480	7097560	interviews that year and the year before that was pretty cool too because I piggybacked
7097560	7104360	on my friend's press pass and the year before that was great because it was my first E3
7104360	7105360	and I got in.
7105360	7110760	I'd actually have to say though that my favorite experience of all the E3s was meeting Koji
7110760	7117400	Kondo and getting it I found the little book with his autograph and that was just fantastic
7117400	7122080	for me of course Dan his highlight is well the picture that's up there of him meeting
7122080	7130640	Yu Suzuki I know that other than that though I did have a really massive migraine and having
7130640	7136440	aching feet was kind of suck and Paris Hilton suck but you know what was actually cool was
7136440	7140760	meeting the Harlem Globetrotters oh cool they were doing that charity thing so that was
7140760	7141760	pretty cool.
7141760	7145840	Takeo Ray sends us a message on Twitter have you seen the Penny Arcade comic about the
7145840	7150720	E3 press conferences pretty accurate retelling oh god yes I did see that and it was great
7150720	7155560	I laughed so hard somebody actually sent that to me on my phone while I was at E3 and I
7155560	7160880	love the Reggie Fils-Aime in the middle panel new Zelda new Goldeneye new Kirby new Metroid
7160880	7165560	new Kid Icarus new 3D shit no glasses Santa Claus is real he's in our booth and he's giving
7165560	7171920	out fucking hand jogs Nintendo bitches we out is that great retelling of what actually
7171920	7176920	happened that's gonna do it for Twitter topics tonight twitter.com slash olr thank you guys

7182560	7187360	right well let's see there's some stuff I kind of talked about a little bit earlier
7187360	7191480	Ubisoft they had a lot of things that were announced during their press conference that
7191480	7196360	kind of people scratching my head because they weren't really game video games perhaps
7196360	7204160	I mean they're sort of games but not quite I don't know so for example mania planet was
7204160	7209420	something that was announced in a partnership that between the company behind the track
7209420	7217240	mania series and nadio and Ubisoft and one of the things that they of course showed off
7217240	7222200	which is pretty awesome was track mania 2 gorgeous looking game they're going to be
7222200	7227360	having a beta coming out for that you can test it out on this fourth quarter of this
7227360	7232560	year shoot mania which is going to be the new kind of first-person shooter type of game
7232560	7237400	that you'll be able to create custom levels for they're gonna have a beta for that sometime
7237400	7241320	the first quarter of 2011 and finally quest mania which is going to be kind of like their
7241320	7246040	RPG maker type of game that will be available for beta at some point they haven't really
7246040	7250880	said when but it's kind of neat though because I know the track me I'm seriously underrated
7250880	7257240	and she did better on consoles ended it really needs to come to like Xbox Live Arcade or
7257240	7265520	even just like 360 or Playstation 3 it'd be really awesome one of the games I I kind of
7265520	7271920	looked at him like you know had I seen this a few years ago or had it been actually cues
7271920	7277960	are I may have to pick this up battle tag which is a game that is basically laser tag
7277960	7282920	you've got a vest in these pistols that you run around with and these different targets
7282920	7288320	that you can use for like checkpoints or whatever you can create your own kind of games out
7288320	7293920	of it and it ties in with your PC which is kind of the scorekeeper kind of like the game
7293920	7298960	master for the stuff and so they announced that it's kind of neat something you would
7298960	7303960	probably see it like kencha hall if there was a kencha hall anymore but that's something
7303960	7309800	else coming out later this year on PC not really like a game per se that you can't like
7309800	7314360	just play like a first person shooter game with it on your PC it's actually just something
7314360	7319080	that uses your PC for like scoring which is interesting and then the game that was pretty
7319080	7328080	much you know the Wii Vitality sensor but not energy and apparently energy was a game
7328080	7332540	that had a sensor that you would put on your finger or penis because you know it's going
7332540	7338760	to happen and you would use this to kind of relax they had a breathing exercise that you
7338760	7346640	could do they made Joel McHale do that because he was hosting the whole event and it's interesting
7346640	7353720	I guess I don't know it's supposed to make you feel good which I guess putting your penis
7353720	7358200	in the sensor might do that I don't know and that's why Santa Claus is at E3 I did post
7358200	7365040	that I'm like oh good well energy what are they thinking time to penis is what exactly
7365040	7369800	all right well moving on with some more news Silent Hill there was some news about that
7369800	7373600	at E3 this year sadly it was not playable on the show floor but there was a new trailer
7373600	7377800	that leaked to the internet and so perhaps you saw some information on that is gone to
7377800	7383640	a new developer it's Vatra is now developing this game so it's going to be very different
7383640	7389900	from me Silent Hill home shattered memories as well as Silent Hill homecoming also missing
7389900	7395240	from this Silent Hill and this is huge Akira Yamaoka is not going to be a part of the new
7395240	7402440	Silent Hill game so this means the new replacement will be Daniel Licht he does the theme song
7402440	7407480	for Dexter the TV show and he also has done Hellraiser and Children of the Corn so I guess
7407480	7412000	that's kind of cool sadly it's going to be not the same without Akira Yamaoka but at
7412000	7416200	the same time I'm looking forward to seeing what Silent Hill and new people's hands is
7416200	7420440	going to be by the way the story if you haven't seen the trailer yet it's about a prison inmate
7420440	7424440	and the transport vehicle basically you know overturns or something and now he's in the
7424440	7429120	fog of Silent Hill which I noticed looked a lot like the movie so I guess you know they're
7429120	7433880	incorporating the movie into the cannon or something I don't know so they are talking
7433880	7439720	about evolving the combat in a different direction as opposed to doing one or the other from
7439720	7445480	the previous games so I don't know Dark Sakura I know you're a big Silent Hill fan are you
7445480	7449640	hopeful about the new Silent Hill game are you kind of like oh too much has changed this
7449640	7456200	isn't going to be Silent Hill anymore I really have to see I'm going to reserve judgment
7456200	7459640	that's a fair way to look at it definitely check out the trailer though if you haven't
7459640	7463800	already it was pretty cool I gotta say all right what do you have for us Dark Sakura
7463800	7469400	well um for those who have been interested in Fallout Online and I know that I've been
7469400	7472440	kind of interested well you know first of all let me rewind just a little bit did you
7472440	7479560	guys see the Fallout New Vegas trailer everything at Bethesda was appointment only um and I
7479560	7483560	didn't see that trailer online no because I haven't even played Fallout 3 well I'm buying
7483560	7487920	a little bit the trailer was online and it was great cool yeah um it was pretty funny
7487920	7495320	actually Bobby was telling me it was very uh very neon in there yeah um well Fallout
7495320	7505240	um online um is actually starting to uh solicit for uh betas for uh for their open beta so
7505240	7511160	um if you go to the Fallout Online website um you should uh I actually I filled out the
7511160	7514180	little form it's just like a little form you sign up for their mailing list and they'll
7514180	7521320	send you information on the beta eventually um but the you know they did have uh Interplay
7521320	7527920	had some legal issues for a while um but now it's finally seems like it's going forward
7527920	7538000	so let's hope so I could deal with some post-apocalyptic you know killing of people too many MMOs so
7538000	7542560	many I'm still stuck on Star Trek Online nothing's gonna get me I know you are I know it doesn't
7542560	7548040	mean I cannot flirt a little bit I'm not in a serious committed relationship nice I have
7548040	7554160	an open relationship with Star Trek Online you can look but you just can't touch I can
7554160	7564600	touch all I want to I trusted I'll always come back alright uh let's go to one more
7564600	7569120	news story and then we got the mailbag coming at you a mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
7569120	7573960	uh one of the things that was shown off during the Konami press conference is of course Def
7573960	7579240	Jam rap star uh what's kind of interesting though is they're gonna have this whole uh
7579240	7585220	online aspect a lot of community features um different you know taunts and stuff like
7585220	7591760	you can do you know uh rap battles or whatever and actually record different things and have
7591760	7598320	like a community I guess there's gonna be uh Def Jam talent scouts and stuff like that
7598320	7606760	oh wow keeping an eye on the uh good rap star players and whatnot uh that's it I don't know
7606760	7611320	it's a lot of community stuff which is really cool uh you know what's interesting is that
7611320	7616760	Def Jam rap star actually looks like a really solid game it's a bummer that I'm not as interested
7616760	7621000	in the content there you know I can't rap please but it actually you know just kind
7621000	7623740	of looking at it and watching other people playing it and then hearing about all this
7623740	7628560	community stuff I was kind of like why can't some of the other music games take a page
7628560	7635080	from this Konami seriously you have this framework you know built for rap star just now make
7635080	7641960	it into a singing game and call it karaoke revolution or you put this next to the glee
7641960	7646320	game that they were also showing off and the glee game looks pathetic yeah the absolutely
7646320	7651960	pathetic game is just a simple you know try to grab it you know the market for the glee
7651960	7658320	stuff because those damn glee albums are top of the charts you know great we have people
7658320	7666200	covering songs and it's popular now um I don't know it's it's interesting but if they actually
7666200	7670800	put out a solid music game and support it with enough download content and had all the
7670800	7676640	community stuff I think it would do really well I agree because yeah the Def Jam game
7676640	7681880	actually it actually I gotta say this I actually kind of wanted to play it you know in the
7681880	7688760	privacy of my own home when nobody's watching I kind of want Irene to play it she would
7688760	7694440	be a lot of fun you know my birthday is coming up maybe I should ask the birthday fairy for
7694440	7699640	some Irene playing Def Jam rap star she could get discovered by a Def Jam scout talent you
7699640	7705800	know they had some rap stars actually there at E3 doing the rapping that's cool they had
7705800	7710120	a Konami had a whole new booth layout this year it hasn't looked like it has in years
7710120	7715480	past they were able to showcase several games it was kind of cool and you know just a kind
7715480	7718680	of a neat game because I don't really care about wrestling games that much but the luchador
7718680	7724440	game looks awesome lucha libre AAA good god did they have a whole show during that they
7724440	7729120	didn't just have the the game at Konami's booth but then I guess the developers or somebody
7729120	7732880	else had a whole huge area right behind it where they were doing the whole who's gonna
7732880	7736440	be on the box for the game that's awesome and just all these wrestling matches going
7736440	7741960	on all day I guess I was glad it kind of drew people in and kept them away from other stuff
7741960	7748960	but I was just like dang it was a heck of people over there I didn't realize the wrestling
7748960	7760840	was so popular anyhow let's go to the mailbag mailbag orange launch radio.com every week
7760840	7764360	we dive in the mailbag and read emails for you guys I'm gonna take over this week since
7764360	7770080	dark soccer is still a little bit you know rough over there with her voice so hopefully
7770080	7775040	she'll be better soon although I should say there's not a lot to read I'm very disappointed
7775040	7780960	in the listenership that during E3 week there's only two emails that you guys want us to read
7780960	7784640	I'm hoping we get more this week after the wrap-up show please send us some emails mailbag
7784640	7788240	orange launch radio.com I especially want to hear from people who have never emailed
7788240	7791360	us before because sometimes we get these emails I've been listening for two years and I've
7791360	7795800	never emailed you guys why not we want to hear from you guys what you guys think of
7795800	7802240	E3 come on we won't we won't make fun of your spelling and grammar too much we promise all
7802240	7807760	right first email from Robert M do you think the announcement of portal 2 and steamworks
7807760	7814840	for the ps3 is related to the introduction of steam on the Mac yes and no I don't think
7814840	7820520	they're necessarily directly related I think it's more of a you know hey yay valve and
7820520	7826440	ps3 are playing nicely but I think definitely it it is a huge card in steam's pocket that
7826440	7830440	it's multi-platform you know I'm gonna go off in a different direction though speaking
7830440	7834680	of like gaming on the Mac and so forth one thing we haven't talked much about that on
7834680	7840320	live was there at E3 and they had a pretty big presence and you know from the demos they
7840320	7844320	were showing it looked pretty good like the games were playing pretty well over those
7844320	7850340	little console boxes and apparently the system is out now on the PC and the Mac and apparently
7850340	7855760	it I'm even seeing the feedback on Twitter and so forth it actually runs pretty well
7855760	7861020	well I'll be damned I know I'll be damned huh who knew who knew but as far as steam
7861020	7865800	goes you know I think certainly steam is trying to expand all these different places because
7865800	7869860	it definitely looks good for them I don't know why I went on the tangent of on life
7869860	7875080	but I guess just the whole like new stuff on the Mac Mac gamers what a niche audience
7875080	7878400	no I'm just kidding Mac gamers have had a lot to celebrate this year I'll tell you that
7878400	7882580	much that's for sure.
7882580	7887840	Going to this other email from Brian S. who didn't have a fancy little nickname but we'll
7887840	7892820	say Brian S. Hey OLR gang while reading the news on the PS move and the MS connect I started
7892820	7897160	wondering these two items are really just expensive peripherals for a console but if
7897160	7902300	any console peripherals really been successful sure during the NES era I loved power glove
7902300	7906820	and play track and field on the power pad but just like R.O.B. they never have more
7906820	7912160	than one or two games for them ignoring peripherals that are specifically made for a game I.E.
7912160	7917980	music and dance genre games most peripherals like the super scope Sega CD 32 X PS 2 hard
7917980	7922320	drive I toy and probably quite a few others I can't remember seem to lack support and
7922320	7926820	third party game development initial launch titles do you think the same could happen
7926820	7934660	to connect slash move if initial game sales are low no I say well I say yes as far as
7934660	7941060	at least the move is concerned I think though it's tricky because you say well you can count
7941060	7945100	these games but you can't count these well selling games I mean I realize that the music
7945100	7949140	and dance things are a little more niche but if you look at connect as like really opening
7949140	7954300	up the exercise exercise gaming thing then it's a little niche too well let's look at
7954300	7959780	the Wii Fit balance board they use that in a lot of games I mean it's an add-on thing
7959780	7966020	but I mean they use that we motion plus it's being used in a lot of things and I toy was
7966020	7969780	used a lot more than I think you might be given it credit for especially in games for
7969780	7974700	the younger audience I mean those aren't really specialized peripherals or anything but I
7974700	7977740	mean if you think about a lot of stuff that they put out that specialized peripherals
7977740	7981740	I mean it's specialized for a reason it's only gonna be used for a few things I mean
7981740	7987620	I understand what you're talking about like the whole I toy and the PlayStation I camera
7987620	7992780	or the Xbox 360 motion camera which was a big waste of money and I need to turn that
7992780	7999060	in for some like store credit somewhere because I would have waste that turn out being exactly
7999060	8006540	so yeah I mean I understand that and you know the expectations I guess for that were a little
8006540	8011900	bit greater than they were now because I think with the PlayStation well even like with the
8011900	8015860	motion camera on the Xbox 360 I think they were thinking it's going to be doing these
8015860	8020420	kind of connect things but it it just it doesn't have the technology that really support that
8020420	8029580	why why aren't our chats is saying yes absolutely yes to this question of will the same fate
8029580	8034100	be met if initial game sales are low he's saying this is why Kinect should be $99 and
8034100	8038580	not a penny more I agree that if they don't have a really awesome game pack in with this
8038580	8048580	game or with connect the 150 is unfortunately past the sweet spot a lot of people are going
8048580	8053980	to be in for as unpleasant shock to that if connect is $150 and it's sitting right next
8053980	8058300	to a weed it's also $150 there's going to be people out there that don't realize you
8058300	8063740	need an Xbox 360 to actually use Kinect and it's going to be depressing for some people
8063740	8069860	bull they're probably trying to package you know their Xbox 360 Kinect combo or something
8069860	8073660	like that that's why I'm saying you know you guys watch out because you're going to see
8073660	8079600	the Kinect for $150 or whatever but you watch them drop the console price or something like
8079600	8087100	ridiculous you know you may see they were saying that there isn't right now a $199 bundle
8087100	8094380	but there will be a $199 skew for the Xbox 360 come on the holiday so they're putting
8094380	8100340	out something I a little more here at the end of the email dark soccer and sky I hope
8100340	8104220	you're both feeling better if not I hope you get well soon oh thank you I'm doing much
8104220	8107940	better than it was the nightly show I am better it's just that my throat was really damaged
8107940	8112780	and it hasn't fully healed yet and that's from Brian s again and also one more thing
8112780	8117180	PS part of the reason I wrote this email was to have a reason to write I love to power
8117180	8122700	glove it's so bad there you go that's your emails for this week mailbag at orange lounge
8122700	8126940	radio.com please fill up our mailbag and so that way when dark soccer's voice is all better
8126940	8131860	she has some work to do we like giving dark soccer lots of work to do don't we all right
8131860	8135060	some more gaming news for you guys and then we're going to open up the skype line at one
8135060	8140900	eight seven seven game OLR but don't call yet it ain't open yet Loki one last things
8140900	8145860	that they showed off during the Ubisoft press conference and they didn't really show anything
8145860	8150860	they just kind of hinted at that it's coming the Michael Jackson game the one that was
8150860	8157500	rumored to be in development is now being developed by Ubisoft and no word exactly on
8157500	8162060	what it is but it's something that's possibly going to be some singing dancing game that
8162060	8168460	does support the connect and I think it's very sad that it's not Sega it is sad that
8168460	8175940	should have been Sega but is Sega and Michael Jackson were BFFs it's moonwalker 2 but uh
8175940	8179740	yet unclear exactly what it's supposed to be but they're saying that the game will be
8179740	8188020	available for connect on Xbox 360 PlayStation move on the ps3 PSP Wii and DS anywhere they
8188020	8193740	can milk that guy for you know more money in the afterlife they will in other words
8193740	8200020	yeah I'm all right I'm right you're right hey this is pretty cool cuz I remember these
8200020	8204940	games they were a lot of fun apparently Burger King is going to be coming back to the 360
8204940	8208740	that's right the Burger King guy is coming back and this time it has to do with connect
8208740	8213820	games buying all of them every single one I don't care how terrible they are I am buying
8213820	8219020	all of them no news on the details no news on the style no news on the number of games
8219020	8224740	all this being said so far is from Burger King chief marketing officer Mike Capit saying
8224740	8229380	our first endeavor with Xbox 360 took the gaming world by storm so we couldn't pass
8229380	8233660	up the chance to come together on another cutting edge program during this year's promotion
8233660	8237900	our guests can look forward to an even greater adventure that will stimulate the imaginations
8237900	8242220	of gamers and entertainment lovers of all shapes and sizes they were so like sneak king
8242220	8248820	was so creepy you don't understand you cannot get more creepier than that game it is absolutely
8248820	8253740	worth the money I don't care how terrible they are because terrible games can sometimes
8253740	8261280	be good games like for example driver 3 terrible game let's not forget the games were five
8261280	8267360	dollars four dollars three ninety nine my bad four dollars is an amazing deal hopefully
8267360	8274860	they're just as expensive this year that'd be great that should be the pack-in right
8274860	8282740	there you know there you go there's your reason to plunk 150 on connect there you go skeptics
8282740	8289500	I think sneaking to featuring connect I think it's gonna be pretty awesome I I high hopes
8289500	8298620	for the connect don't screw me again damn camera games I learned my lesson with I actually
8298620	8303440	bought the camera for every single damn system they've all failed me so far except I did
8303440	8311260	not buy the camera those on the week sound like exercise games but anyways so yeah there's
8311260	8315200	some more features being announced for a little big planet to lots of cool stuff that they're
8315200	8321940	showing the whole community features one aspect they're saying that of course getting revamped
8321940	8328860	is all the stuff that they had it's gonna be easier to find players creations and of
8328860	8333080	course the they're gonna have a different interface now no longer we have to search
8333080	8339240	cross-planets to find different levels and the ability to actually bring them up a list
8339240	8346920	also different like metrics like genres keywords etcetera and they're also saying that they're
8346920	8353220	gonna be apparently there's gonna be some functions I guess by the little big planet
8353220	8359120	dot me I guess the web portal where you're able to give players their own personal websites
8359120	8364540	which automatically update with their creations and recently played levels and top scores
8364540	8370720	so it's kind of like a Facebook for a little big planet type stuff and in it of course
8370720	8377860	you can you know see the pages in the browser's games will be automatically queued up next
8377860	8383820	time you play your game if you know pick different levels on there also you can just I guess
8383820	8388940	print out one of the QR barcodes assigned to each level and you pop it in for your PlayStation
8388940	8394240	I and your creations come up that kind of cool if you like made some games or whatever
8394240	8398840	put it on your business card but that little barcode on there and then people can scan
8398840	8408200	your barcode or your business card level pops up or or Rob think here for a second when
8408200	8413160	it be awesome to get little big plan to you make business cards with like say our website
8413160	8417780	on it with that barcode and you go when you load that level it has a bunch of information
8417780	8424780	about our website the podcast all that stuff in level like a playable business card or
8424780	8428220	those shirts we've been talking about doing for seven years you could put on the barcode
8428220	8434000	on the shirt and then like or or maybe maybe we need all our pants so that way the barcode
8434000	8440500	is on the but and it could be here scan my butt and you could play a little big planet
8440500	8446600	to the orange on radio experience using your but I think it's a great idea yeah we need
8446600	8450860	all our pants are started do they do they do they let you make your own pants with logos
8450860	8458020	on the but it would be hard there's got to be a way to do it I don't scream I mean who
8458020	8462960	cares about shirts when you can have all our with a barcode but could do that you can do
8462960	8467240	like I think on those like cafe press and stuff like that you can do like boxers and
8467240	8474360	stuff well our underwear with the barcode on your body too hard to design a transfer
8474360	8480700	it really wouldn't that's an even better idea I want to play the ULR level pull down your
8480700	8499700	pants oh this is just wrong I'll show you my little big planet that's what you say on
8499700	8508840	the back it would say little big planet and on the front it would just say big planet
8508840	8518620	with two moons that orbit it all right I'm in the room with children tonight's show is
8518620	8523460	like a little girl tonight's show has been way too serious e3 is serious business we
8523460	8528940	needed some barcodes on your ass to to break the tension a little bit that's just you 100
8528940	8533920	and that asks will that barcode make it easier to friend your but maybe that's what Nintendo
8533920	8541220	print plans to have a repeat of the of the senior video maybe after the show I know maybe
8541220	8546540	later we'll do that maybe later all right but we got a serious business guy's e3 is
8546540	8551700	serious serious business you know laughing at it oh yeah you have you mentioned that
8551700	8555900	you know he's all fuck clothes I want a well our tattoo I actually saw the other day when
8555900	8561580	I was searching for stuff to do the stencils for the baby's room they do have things you
8561580	8568820	can get where you can print your own temporary tattoos that could happen I know our temporary
8568820	8574680	tattoo yes that's that's about what the giveaways were at e3 this year by the way I know people
8574680	8580180	think you walk out of e3 with bags and bags of crap and them giving away 360 the one press
8580180	8583860	cameras yeah it used to be that way but now in this economy like you're lucky if you get
8583860	8589540	a temporary tattoo my boss brought me a Tron evolution t-shirt that has a the disc on the
8589540	8594980	back and then also get that and also I got a paratig t-shirt I fucking play Tron I didn't
8594980	8602340	get the Tron shirt bastards Disney I got more swag and I didn't even go ha ha ha I have
8602340	8608460	a Tron shirt I got a rock band 3 shirt that mine came from you know Disneyland oh yeah
8608460	8612920	it's true I remember that shirt I remember that you know I have the Kubrick the Tron
8612920	8619220	figure set mm-hmm I got those for Dan somewhere in this house amongst all this crap Black
8619220	8623860	Wolf saying he got the Tron shirt too what the hell is this here I am talking nice about
8623860	8627580	Tron and everything I ain't get no shirt oh well it's all right people need to send me
8627580	8635500	a Tron shirt hmm I'm the biggest Tron fan in this room all right oh and Black Wolf is
8635500	8642280	mad now he didn't get a rock band 3 shirt good we're even all right we are officially
8642280	8647180	even all right one more story for you guys then we're gonna take some calls at 877 game
8647180	8651540	olr or our username on skype is orange lounge radio and that is a new controller coming
8651540	8657060	out for the PlayStation 3 that was being shown at e3 it was from a hori and they are marketing
8657060	8663100	a ps3 MMO controller I'm assuming this is for Final Fantasy 14 and possibly DC Universe
8663100	8666660	and it is a strange looking device I mean yes it's a keyboard but there's all these
8666660	8671840	weird looking buttons on the side of it and most interestingly a device that you can pick
8671840	8677500	up with like one hand so you can like play your MMO and control it with one hand and
8677500	8681300	then type with the other or whatever else you want to do with well hey the way it looks
8681300	8684500	like what it looks like no well what it look yeah I mean that's it's basically I don't
8684500	8688160	think you can pick that up it's just meant to like rest your hand on it but basically
8688160	8692580	they have it so that you know one analog stick it looks like and then a couple button I'm
8692580	8696760	assuming those buttons are for the triggers are on one side and then the other side has
8696760	8701460	the other analog stick and then it also has the four face buttons and I think the two
8701460	8705340	trigger buttons as well you know it kind of reminds me of remember how they have that
8705340	8714900	keyboard for Fantasy Star I think on the GameCube or something like that yes it's like that
8714900	8719940	but honestly though just buy a USB keyboard you don't need this fancy piece of shit Toa
8719940	8723860	Gak wants to know the time to penis for this controller because it does you know it does
8723860	8728560	have a little curvature there where the looks like you would grab that little controller
8728560	8734380	thing I'd expect to be longer than say the other relaxed type thing just because it's
8734380	8738780	not obvious to put your penis in there and it'll probably come out in Japan first and
8738780	8743860	they're not as disgusting as we are here in America so I would say it's gonna be at least
8743860	8752380	a few days I think they're not I guess that's true I get let me say it's not as is all over
8752380	8762220	the internet with vending machines about the vending machines and and moe lap pillows you
8762220	8766660	think this is the country that's ooga-booga that's the country you know what though that
8766660	8771100	brought us the Hello Kitty vibrator hold on hold on because they're not so repressed by
8771100	8775500	having all of that there's no need to put your penis on an MMO controller that's because
8775500	8779060	you have all these other but here in America where everybody's sheltered everybody gets
8779060	8793900	freaky deaky behind closed doors the pecan all right what yeah whatever see see Bobby
8793900	8798580	agree I think I'm on to something though with the fact that we don't notice it as much because
8798580	8803220	they're not as repressed as we are over here oh shoot yeah the same the same country that
8803220	8810100	gave us love blue girl I guess that's true too but still they're not tentacle porn Rob
8810100	8813380	tentacle you're not hearing about them putting their dicks in things it's just that they
8813380	8819880	marry inanimate objects how long is Japan anyway actually I was I was listening to a podcast
8819880	8825000	just recently called stuff mom never told you oh it's by the people that did stuff you
8825000	8831940	missed in history class yeah those are the podcasts I listen to hello but they were talking
8831940	8837380	about how there actually is an epidemic sort of going around now in Japan where men are
8837380	8844820	sort of withdrawing from dating and it's not that you know it's just that they're not interested
8844820	8850220	in sex at all that's why they have the guy married his lap pillow and the guy married
8850220	8856660	his video game and all of this and they're actually looking at it affecting birth rates
8856660	8861400	in the future tiger Connor Tarrant says don't be surprised when people start taking photos
8861400	8867220	of their 3d penis on the 3ds I thought that exactly and actually I hope there's ways you
8867220	8872460	can share pictures online somehow that that is one really cool which is the worst possible
8872460	8876280	comment to follow what tiger class said but I was thinking about it for other purposes
8876280	8880380	thank you that is one cool thing though that they did have on the 3ds I think would be
8880380	8885620	kind of neat to play around with I'm also wondering though with everything being based
8885620	8890460	off like you know camera technology how long before we see a YouTube video or something
8890460	8899220	like that some chick or whatever playing scantily clad you know god whatever just dance just
8899220	8906940	lap dance up skirt cam 3d or you know dance central pole dance central yeah black woven
8906940	8913120	chat says sky is thinking about craigslist 3d penis postings wave of the future folks
8913120	8917240	wave of the future I don't want to see that wave of the future I had to I had to share
8917240	8923580	the image with our chat room of of the poster for love so what you're suggesting is that
8923580	8931140	it's chat roulette 3d oh god I don't what do you think is worse on the internet craigslist
8931140	8938340	or chat roulette chat roulette even though you got robbed of a several hundred dollar
8938340	8943700	machine on craigslist you still think chat roulette is worse probably I've never been
8943700	8953940	on chat roulette so I can only imagine though nice we should we should do olr on chat roulette
8953940	8961540	one night just for fun hi you're on orange lounge radio what what's that you guys are
8961540	8976900	gay friend my butt all right let's open up the skype line 1877 game olr or our username
8976900	8982660	on skype is orange lounge radio the skype line is now open for business ossifer is saying
8982660	8986260	I should go to chat roulette right now no I'm not gonna go chat roulette right now not
8986260	8990620	gonna derail the show completely with chat roulette although I would like to see like
8990620	8994820	maybe a podcast with some of the video game people just playing on chat roulette it'd
8994820	9000900	be fun although the joke would probably get old real quick 1877 game olr or our username
9000900	9003900	on skype is orange lounge radio give us a call if you want to ask us anything about
9003900	9007860	e3 or talk about anything at e3 or maybe there was something on the show floor you didn't
9007860	9014360	get to see enough of I don't know give us a call and we'll have some words in the meantime
9014360	9020060	Loki you got any last minute stories for us yes let's talk about the summer of arcade
9020060	9024140	coming out of course this summer they've announced the lineup for summer of arcade including
9024140	9029060	castlevania harmony of despair hydro thunder hurricane lorecroft and the guardian of light
9029060	9033900	limbo and monday night combat each if you buy all of those you will get a refund for
9033900	9043120	800 microsoft points or ten dollars so ten dollars ten dollars yes let's go to the phones
9043120	9049240	hi you're on orange launch radio who's this uh legend azaku well hey legend azaku what's
9049240	9059100	on your mind uh just here on my bed with my mac um let's see um all that post e3 stuff
9059100	9065380	that you're still trying to digest i suppose and you too that event for me was basically
9065380	9070860	seeing the gran turismo 5 trailer ah that was completely missed by us here at olr that's
9070860	9076580	right finally a freaking date for uh gran turismo 5 just play dancing games i'm a big
9076580	9082340	i'm a big sucker for those like racing racing simulator games if you're a fan of racing
9082340	9088660	games let me tell you this on the 3ds there was a demo on the floor for ridge racer it
9088660	9096020	looked great but it played like garbage so i really hope this was just like a concept
9096020	9100660	demo and that uh the real thing is fixed because when you run into a wall it's like not even
9100660	9105980	realistic your car will turn like 45 degrees when you run into a wall it's crazy uh was
9105980	9111740	it the psp ridge racer games i can't imagine it'd be too hard to port that stuff over but
9111740	9115860	uh mario kart uh that concept video looked great but i know that's not like realistic
9115860	9120900	racing but i just thought i'd throw that in there i mean when i actually saw the trailer
9120900	9126380	i couldn't i couldn't imagine how detailed how much effort was put into actually making
9126380	9132500	it look almost realistic hence the reason for the number of delays so at least at least
9132500	9138660	in this at least in this video game generation duke nukem forever kind of got lost whereas
9138660	9145900	um well in other words gt5 managed to beat duke nukem forever and like vaporware that
9145900	9150420	never actually became vaporware but it's gonna happen it's gonna happen hey duke nukem at
9150420	9153580	least has the manhattan game for whatever it's worth let me ask you this zach goes and
9153580	9156820	share a racing game fan need to kind of bring up what happened at the press conferences
9156820	9162980	what did you think of microsoft showing off forza with no wheel is that interesting to
9162980	9168100	you or are you just kind of like gimmick gimmick this is like i need a wheel i need a physical
9168100	9175500	wheel to grab onto something tangible not not some micky mouse pretend wheel if i want
9175500	9180140	to do that i could just do that right now by just moving my my hands at ten and two
9180140	9184800	in the air oh you're probably pissed about mad cats having to discontinue that wheel
9184800	9192780	huh no i want my i want like a logic technique or something and mad cats is taking over production
9192780	9198900	of that wheel they're not just microsoft is continuing mad cats i thought i took it away
9198900	9202820	from the story that it just wasn't happening period no because i thought that they they
9202820	9206020	even had a picture of the mad cats one that looked exactly like the other one unless i
9206020	9210100	was photoshopped which it could have been um i was gonna say what'd be kind of cool
9210100	9216060	is with these you know new camera peripherals and whatever that have something that incorporates
9216060	9220460	where you actually play the game say with like a controller and then you can make a
9220460	9226900	gesture or something like that to do something shift up and down break but then you need
9226900	9233540	enough space to actually get you need no surface area to actually get the actual the you know
9233540	9238700	the person to actually get their image in there and for the camera to do its logic to
9238700	9243020	detect moves or not even necessarily anything that has to do with shifting but like you
9243020	9247260	know perspective change or something like that so you can like do a little bit i mean
9247260	9251740	head tracking they already said and sony already said that it's going to be supported for grants
9251740	9258620	original five via the camera it's just that i you know i guess head tracking would make
9258620	9265260	would you know make sense if you actually had like a vr headset not just through like
9265260	9270780	a tv like i it wouldn't it wouldn't feel right if i'm just tilting my head one way i couldn't
9270780	9277500	even see that that angle if it was trying to do that sort of head tracking unless i
9277500	9282740	actually saw it in front of me all right well zaku i want to change the topic one more time
9282740	9286680	here before we let you go because i i know you you've been a long time listener of the
9286680	9290920	show and you you know you know a lot about music games surely you have an opinion on
9290920	9298540	dance masters yeah um you mean that new konami game for the connect right yes yeah i actually
9298540	9304060	read the interview on bamani style with nayoki and he's basically trying to you know he's
9304060	9310820	trying to pitch that game trying to like because you know i mean it's gonna be it's gonna be
9310820	9316540	a tough battle between what harmonix is is dishing out because i think if anything konami's
9316540	9321860	pretty much missed the boat on some of these major events in the past 10 years of where
9321860	9327140	they could have capitalized on on this whole you know on the whole rhythm gaming genre
9327140	9333900	in this country and their failure to do it resulted in the prominence and rise of folks
9333900	9340220	like that you know like like activision like harmonix and they missed the boat on so many
9340220	9345020	occasions not i can't i don't really think i could take them seriously but that's not
9345020	9351540	to say that i'm gonna like shun this game completely i know i know with the connect
9351540	9358860	you know the new motion the new motion control scheme it kind of replaces the pads from from
9358860	9363660	that perspective you won't you don't have to worry about buying a dedicated like peripheral
9363660	9369900	just for that game if the camera could actually see the camera could actually see your whole
9369900	9376340	body and detect and accurately detect all the movements then that could definitely go
9376340	9383260	far not only just on the 360 or the consoles but think about a possible arcade application
9383260	9387700	yeah be interesting it came in the arcade i gotta say too zacku having played it it
9387700	9393100	it it reads really well i mean it's a scary accurate little thing however keep in mind
9393100	9397020	we were at e3 where everything's in a very nicely controlled environment so i'm really
9397020	9400540	curious to see if that continues right i mean yeah that's that's the thing with connect
9400540	9406460	it hasn't been like i don't think it's been extensively um field tested that to the point
9406460	9412720	where right it's still it hasn't been released yet but it's like a really it's close to like
9412720	9417160	release candidate status anyways it's like late beta yeah if microsoft really really
9417160	9420760	wanted to impress me those rooms the little bubbles that they were showing connect in
9420760	9424820	on the show floor instead of being bright light rooms would it look like actual people's
9424820	9429700	living rooms but maybe they weren't last year when i thought you know what i i mean last
9429700	9435220	year when i actually saw when i actually heard of project natal i didn't realize that i actually
9435220	9439080	didn't take them that seriously just because they were doing something that nintendo's
9439080	9445620	already done and sony to an extent with the with the ps with the i-20 back in the playstation
9445620	9453740	date and and then one year later we see how far how advanced this camera is and it's pretty
9453740	9459420	much it's pretty much something in its own that could stand on its own because it's that
9459420	9465160	it's not just any maybe you know it's not just any old mickey mouse camera that tries
9465160	9473740	to detect you know a 2d image of that of that actor it actually goes it actually has another
9473740	9479460	dimension to it so if it has if it's that accurate in turn you know with that type of
9479460	9485560	detection that could really go that could really push microsoft foreign in this whole
9485560	9489580	new genre that they're trying to dish out all right well uh zack we gotta let you go
9489580	9493620	to get more calls but thank you very much for your call and uh happy racing or dancing

9559460	9565500	3 and sorcery which looks really terrible you didn't like the sorcery demo that looks
9565500	9571700	stupid all right let's go to the phones hi you're on orange lounge radio who's this hey
9571700	9579060	it's sturlock hey sturlock what's on your mind uh not much i was uh just wanted to give
9579060	9586780	my thoughts and impressions about uh e3 yeah please do what you think um i was pretty impressed
9586780	9594420	um i'm actually you probably wouldn't uh expect me to say this but uh i'm actually looking
9594420	9600500	forward to the 3ds now of course for for listeners that may not know why that's a surprise because
9600500	9605540	they're new to orange lounge radio why would that be a surprise to people uh because i'm
9605540	9611620	uh totally blind so you know the three the 3d aspect of it is kind of meaningless to
9611620	9621060	me but uh the reason i'm looking forward to it is because uh apparently um there's gonna
9621060	9630000	be a much higher you know uh capacity um for like you know data storage so i'm looking
9630000	9636340	forward to uh how the audio is gonna improve especially and with the really impressive
9636340	9642860	lineup of games i'm uh i'm really looking forward to it absolutely i mean certainly
9642860	9650100	the games are part of what wins me over as well you know as as neato and starfox 64 ocarina
9650100	9656780	time uh paper mario i don't know super street fighter 4 i'm really looking forward to that
9656780	9660860	you know it's how they do that no it's really sad that they did not have a demo for or even
9660860	9668500	in development a new f-zero game with 3d yeah i know and i'm surprised with everything else
9668500	9676700	that was announced maybe i immediately you know thought of you when that was announced
9676700	9685400	funny enough i think a lot of listeners did so and uh also um i don't know if you guys
9685400	9693300	got to see it but um the new mortal kombat looks just freaking insane you know sadly
9693300	9698200	there was a huge line just to get in and see it although apparently it was playable in
9698200	9701660	that little room that they were showing um and unfortunately we didn't get in there it
9701660	9706380	was just a matter of prioritizing as much of a fan as mortal kombat as i am there was
9706380	9711780	this other stuff i wanted to see more um it was getting a lot of very positive buzz though
9711780	9715380	from the people that saw it it sounds like the franchise is going back in the right direction
9715380	9724300	which thank you which thank god it's what it needed um and yeah i think i think that
9724300	9729100	trailer is all you really need of dc universe i was not too impressed with the last few
9729100	9739660	games um especially with that stupid story mode slash rpg element that was in a lot of
9739660	9745360	them yeah i didn't care then they tried to do the puzzle combat and it just it just spread
9745360	9750740	itself combat i think and uh was it motor combat they were trying to be like mario kart
9750740	9755140	oh yeah remember when a mortal kombat game just randomly had the mario kart mode in it
9755140	9759220	like what the hell was that was more for like just being funny i mean that was the whole
9759220	9768500	point it's like huh like we're funny you know um yeah i still sucked well sturlock was there
9768500	9776100	anything else out of e3 that really made you excited besides just the 3ds um not really
9776100	9784260	i thought the move looked kind of stupid it seemed like okay the it's kind of like what
9784260	9789060	you guys thought it's basically the weeb but with better graphics i think when you put
9789060	9795080	these new things side by side the move and the um ds or 3ds the reason why you know loki
9795080	9798940	just read off the big list of games that are coming to the move and i'm kind of just going
9798940	9804100	eh either i already played it with a controller or i can play it with a controller or i'm
9804100	9807900	just not really interested in dropping the money just to play it with a move that's oh
9807900	9813580	i am kind of i am kind of looking forward to connect though with um seeing how the like
9813580	9819620	the voice commands work i'm really curious because you know voice recognition kind of
9819620	9827220	has this reputation of being a little iffy so i'm really curious how that's gonna like
9827220	9831340	handle me too because that's not something they were really showing off at e3 again i
9831340	9834300	think they might have been a little nervous about that technology they mentioned it a
9834300	9841420	little bit um and i guess what you do is you just say you know xbox play or whatever but
9841420	9845020	yeah they didn't show it off very extensively i think that their technology's gotten a lot
9845020	9849740	better and obviously you know with sync and everything they have that technology kind
9849740	9854660	of down i mean they have something developed in place for it so they're not going to release
9854660	9861420	it you know without it working correctly yeah right hopefully well sterlock we gotta let
9861420	9864860	you go to take more calls but thanks so much for your phone call and we'll talk to you
9864860	9871100	again soon in a future week okay all right all right later see uh quick question from
9871100	9876300	message 100 matt why is it that when nintendo ports gamecube to the wii wii poo poo it but
9876300	9883020	when the 3ds ports a lot of n64 games we praise them that's a good question i i don't i actually
9883020	9887860	think all the porting makes me nervous i don't really praise it in fact i think okra in time
9887860	9893940	once again overrated damn game um i could care less that it's on there starfox 64 was
9893940	9899460	kind of fun but yeah i don't want to see a bunch of old 64 games just being ported over
9899460	9903940	because they can it's neat to see these things in 3d for the first time i'll give you that
9903940	9907660	but is it 30 neat or however much they're going to charge for the games you know they're
9907660	9912100	going to be more expensive than a regular ds game this is going to be an excuse to jack
9912100	9918300	up the price 510 bucks you know that right you know that hi you're on orange lounge radio
9918300	9928980	who's this who's dt hey dt what's on your mind buddy uh you know watching the e3 coverage
9928980	9937340	all week mm-hmm how was e3 from the comfort of your living room oh still pretty good you
9937340	9941660	know what sometimes i think that's that's the way to do it because a lot of those people
9941660	9946320	can get into places that i sure couldn't out there on the show floor so uh there's anything
9946320	9951200	wrong with uh staying tuned to the tv at home what caught your uh eyes and ears at e3 this
9951200	9961460	year oh everything nintendo had pretty surprising yeah the 3ds was definitely something to behold
9961460	9965260	not just that though i mean i know we keep talking 3ds 3ds but they really did have an
9965260	9970660	impressive we line up i have not plugged in my we in about six months and now i'm like
9970660	9975740	oh god metroid other m and goldeneye and the kirby game looks pretty good i'm gonna have
9975740	9984220	to dust off that thing and uh get it in there oh yeah so all those first party games coming
9984220	9990660	mm-hmm yeah lots and lots of stuff what'd you think of a connect and move well i thought
9990660	9997060	that was cool i'd you know we pretty much called it as far as the uh dance masters goes
9997060	10001460	isn't that that's the first thing we said was they should have like a paratype game
10001460	10006820	for connect i'm not sure if i said it but i think someone here did and uh yeah they
10006820	10010900	got it right you guys uh hit the nail on the head where as i said yeah right you're never
10010900	10015540	gonna get a paratype game in the us and and here it is this is but but i think we can
10015540	10022540	all agree this is as close as you're ever gonna get if dance masters is not enough for
10022540	10026980	you have a night of fire in it with the actual para dance from back in the day i don't think
10026980	10032300	there's really gonna be anything that's gonna make you happy at all you know what's really
10032300	10037260	funny is that was actually one of my future uh my career view articles was gonna be about
10037260	10041980	all those motion controlled dancing games like para para and dance maniacs and all of
10041980	10046980	that well you're you're gonna have to get those up sooner rather than later now because
10046980	10050900	everyone's gonna have to uh be curious about that by the way speaking of dance maniacs
10050900	10055400	uh at arcade infinity they still had a working dance maniacs machine can you believe it after
10055400	10062260	all these years i was just watching some videos of it randomly you know what their most popular
10062260	10068740	video game was though at arcade infinity they had super street fighter four rigged up to
10068740	10073680	a little one of those japanese sit down and play cabinets and it just said one token donation
10073680	10078020	please and so you can actually play using the japanese cabinet and the controller and
10078020	10081420	everything but since it was just running off a console they couldn't really charge people
10081420	10085620	for it but they asked people to please make a token donation it had the longest line of
10085620	10092700	anything there i saw crazy oh wow people want to have that arcade experience that oh yeah
10092700	10097340	xbox it's not that hard to set up yeah it's very interesting that that was uh the most
10097340	10101300	popular thing though probably the only other thing that really had a line was uh maybe
10101300	10108020	either 2dx serious or uh dj max technica i was like hold notes what are these hold notes
10108020	10113700	in my 2dx you know i have that's maniacs huh i have a dance maniacs do you read the actual
10113700	10118860	machine i have the arcade board what i have a working arcade i have a system 573 board
10118860	10128220	it's sitting at my desk it's a footrest right now look it up dummy let's play yeah all right
10128220	10133900	well dt did you have anything else you want to share with our listeners today just that
10133900	10138540	the uh retro review for damn sense revolution this week all right thank you so much for
10138540	10141980	all the hard work you do on those articles we really appreciate it at orange lounge radio
10141980	10147940	dot com lots of good stuff there all right thanks so much ct you have a good week you
10147940	10153220	too all right that's our own dark tetsuya who writes articles for orange lounge radio
10153220	10158300	don't rig that up it wouldn't be that difficult to do i think you got a new project now i
10158300	10161620	don't need more projects i have to finish the ones i have right now all right sorry
10161620	10164900	to those who didn't get through tonight it was a very very busy phone ringing off the
10164900	10169660	hook if you didn't get through though um i do always recommend uh our mailbag which is
10169660	10174000	mailbag at orange lounge radio dot com or of course our twitter and all those other
10174000	10178900	ways we interact with the show live chat and all that fun stuff too um any other quick
10178900	10183100	last minute stories you want to get out loki yeah apparently you can use the playstation
10183100	10188260	3 dual shock controller instead of the moves navigation controller this is a navigation
10188260	10194020	controller costs thirty dollars by itself seriously thirty dollars eighty dollars per
10194020	10201460	controller if you add the two together um this is interesting bobby kotak evil guy that
10201460	10206420	works for activision of course you know he says whose idea it probably was to not have
10206420	10214040	a booth and instead have that party he says um that he wishes that call of duty uh was
10214040	10218980	a subscription service he says i would have call of duty be an online subscription um
10218980	10224340	service tomorrow when you think about uh the audience's interests and how you could really
10224340	10228860	satisfy a bigger audience with more inspired creative opportunities i would love to see
10228860	10235220	uh or love to see us have an online call of duty world think our players would just um
10235220	10239260	have so much of a more compelling experience in other words he thinks that people that
10239260	10244820	buy call of duty are suckers and that they're willing to pay um extra money to play online
10244820	10249560	with call of duty and to be honest with those 15 dollar map packs that sell like crazy he
10249560	10258740	might be right which is really sad uh of course everyone wants to compare you know console
10258740	10266940	versus console well now amazon has um different interests um of course that um show on their
10266940	10276340	website for preorders whatever for connect and for the move and right now um apparently
10276340	10282140	they have uh the connect holds the number one spot on their top selling uh video games
10282140	10288820	list with the xbox 360 the new one right behind it and the first mention of the playstation
10288820	10293660	move is the navigation controller which is at number 44 in the move starter bundle at
10293660	10300880	number 46 so apparently right now there is more interest in the xbox connect let me read
10300880	10303540	some comments from our chat room chat dot orange on twitter dot com by the way that's
10303540	10306900	very interesting though how they're using amazon as a predictor that's kind of a neat
10306900	10310740	way to do it tiger claw says uh oh you guys didn't mention that new mario sports game
10310740	10314780	called mario sports mix who's down from some mario dodgeball i think it came up earlier
10314780	10318860	in the show i mentioned it i thought it was stupid and i played it and it really yeah
10318860	10324340	i played the volleyball game because the the dodgeball wasn't demoable it was cute but
10324340	10327940	i think it's more of a kid it's basically mario simple it was too simple yeah it's basically
10327940	10332220	mario tennis but they just have a bunch of different sports reskinned and stuff the basketball's
10332220	10335100	kind of neat because it's a little bit like that mario three and three basketball game
10335100	10339900	they have on the ds but speaking of basketball here's the game i didn't mention nba jam on
10339900	10345020	the wii was out there on the show floor looked pretty awesome i gotta say i i'm very i'm
10345020	10349820	interested in it i yes i'm interested in a sports game omg uh yyr in our chat room speaking
10349820	10354500	on the bobby kotak story you just said says uh bobby kotak to increase our profit margins
10354500	10358780	further i would love to personally fuck all of our customers in the ass of course they
10358780	10363100	would have to pay me for it first i'm not sure how that increases profit margins might
10363100	10367980	increase something there's some pictures that came out um showing the baby uh babysitting
10367980	10377820	mama controller which looks like mama's head on a baby i guess it's kind of creepy i want
10377820	10382900	to say my babysitting my babysitting mama that could be a song i got distracted i think
10382900	10386900	it would have been funnier if the uh baby mama had looked like cooking mama but was
10386900	10394540	black i got distracted what by our own wiki why i found the kmart page our wiki is pretty
10394540	10398120	awesome if you've never been to the orange lounge radio wiki you can either access it
10398120	10402580	at orange lounge radio dot com and then in the little box on the left hand side there's
10402580	10409840	a w or just go to orange lounge radio dot wikia w ia.com and there's all this like useless
10409840	10413980	information and i mean that in the most positive thankful way to our listeners to put it together
10413980	10418140	useless information about our show we need much more of that too did they ever put up
10418140	10425220	our um never forget i'm not sure i don't think so i don't know if i saw it you better seek
10425220	10432460	that out tiger class says was bionic commando rearm two playable at e3 um not out in the
10432460	10439820	open no capcom was showing us some other stuff any other quick uh stories loki uh dances
10439820	10446540	revolution x2 the arcade version will be out in japan july 7th it's kind of neat i guess
10446540	10458620	maybe we'll see it over here at some point uh and i think that's pretty much it all right
10458620	10462740	well before we get to the final thoughts i've got to say this because we've been so dominated
10462740	10467060	with e3 news i didn't have a chance to say this earlier in the show so unfortunately
10467060	10472340	just was a bad week uh but seriously a very very happy father's day to all the gaming
10472340	10475780	daddies listening to orange lounge radio i know there's a few of you and i hope you had
10475780	10481940	a wonderful father's day loki very soon to join those ranks well duh again yeah yeah

10523380	10526080	that's all we ask because we don't have a lot of marketing dollars or anything like
10526080	10531260	that to pour into this show it would be nice if we had a million dollars but we don't and
10531260	10534540	if you do get a million dollars apparently if you are a million dollar operation not
