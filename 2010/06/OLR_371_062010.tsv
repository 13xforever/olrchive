13920	24749	Tonight, June 20th, 2010, we talk about Nintendo going 3D, Microsoft going Kinect, Sony joining forces with Steam, and more on our E3 wrap-up show, live.
31741	40905	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome to another week of that video game talk show where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.
41005	48469	Joining you over the next three hours, my name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always, say hello to the one, the only, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
50089	50329	Hi.
50570	51430	Hi, how are you Jamie?
52871	53651	I'm doing better.
53939	56280	You're doing a little better in the voice department, it sounds like.
56360	66483	Yeah, but yesterday the wind kicked up and allergies got crazy, so my voice was like... At least you don't sound as terrible as I did on some of those nightly shows for me three this week.
66543	69705	The Rob Robertson pals and laryngitis is what it really should have been called.
69725	70285	It was pretty bad.
70465	72005	Your pals with laryngitis?
72406	75207	Oh, the smartass over there is Loki, Techmaster Loki.
75247	75707	How are you?
76107	76767	I'm fine.
77307	78748	And did you have a good week?
80188	81689	and DarkSakura.
100499	117451	but also I do want to point out we want to talk about the stuff that you want to hear about live so make sure you join us in our chat room chat.orangeloungeradio.com if you are listening live on this Sunday night because we do tape live every Sunday night at All Games Radio www.allgames.com at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern
117811	118152	E3 Week E3 Week
139373	141214	and what kind of games you played this week.
141254	142754	So DarkSakura, why don't you start us off.
143455	144195	How was your game of the week?
144215	146816	And by the way, actually, I should say this before you started.
147156	151418	DarkSakura and Loki were unable to go to E3 this year due to personal stuff.
151438	152178	Yeah, rub it in.
152578	153298	Well, I'm sorry.
153378	154319	I don't mean to rub it in.
154359	158400	But just, you know, in case the listeners are like, well, they're just going to talk about E3 all week.
158420	158680	No, no.
159040	163302	I mean, there was other games to be played besides just the ones at the LA Convention Center.
164275	167798	I played Star Trek Online, which I was playing when you guys got here.
170241	173964	And I wanted to thank Bobby for going ten minutes over because it gave me time to finish my mission.
174725	175426	So thank you, Bobby.
177307	178448	I was busy shooting Romulans.
179770	180250	Good times.
182622	183002	DarkSakura.com
202495	204816	Well, I do have to mention that I told you this earlier.
205276	207097	My teacher, I'm taking U.S.
207137	207517	History.
208217	209618	My teacher brought up the Oregon Trail.
210098	210358	Nice.
210598	216040	And she said, you remember that game, you know, where you have to stockpile meat and everything?
216060	217321	We're like, Oregon Trail.
217341	218521	She's like, yeah, that game.
219001	221302	It's like, well, people really did die from all this stuff.
221582	222643	And I told her about your shirt.
223503	225404	The one that said you have died of dysentery.
225484	225704	Yes.
225864	227604	And she laughed and then looked a little bit sick.
229565	231606	My teacher's also a little preggers.
232228	232709	Oh, I see.
232769	234550	So she carried a couple pounds back to the wagon.
234891	235811	Yes.
235872	238894	You know that game where you're on a trail to Oregon?
239034	240055	What's it called again?
240075	240656	I don't know.
241610	241910	All right.
242631	244572	Loki, how was your gaming week?
244592	245433	I just played Grand Theft Auto.
245533	246233	That's pretty much it.
246733	247114	That's it?
247834	249195	That's all I had time for.
250396	251577	I don't think I played anything else.
251737	253118	Oh, a little bit of Earth Defense Force.
253518	254539	Just getting through that some more.
254619	259702	But mainly just Grand Theft Auto because I had to go lose a game by $2 one day.
259722	264345	So that means I had to take it out on my coworkers by kicking the crap out of them.
264826	268588	It was funny, though, because one of the games actually quadrupled second place's score.
268788	270649	I had $4,000 and the person below me had $1,000.
272270	296177	I kicked the crap out of them that was in 15 minutes too by the way apparently my boss was bragging to Take-Two because they had a meeting with them about how wonderful I am at Grand Theft Auto to which I'm sure they didn't care yeah I was gonna say I don't think Take-Two would really be concerned with how good you are he's like did you know that there's somebody that works with us that's in the top 100 in the world no really
298300	299681	Which I was like, okay, whatever.
299781	302442	You were glued to the E3 press conferences all week though, right?
302542	306103	Yeah, I watched those instead of working because I can do that.
306824	307564	So were we.
307744	312306	We were watching from our hotel room because we don't get invited to fun stuff like that, but that's okay.
312586	322070	So we got to watch them all from the comfort of our historic hotel room in downtown LA, not far from where all the rioting was taking place after Game 7, but I digress.
322450	324931	What did you think of all the press conferences as you were watching them, Loki?
324951	325031	Okay.
327030	327670	They were pretty cool.
327710	334053	I mean, what was kind of unique, I guess, is no one really kind of failed at press conferences.
334113	345278	I mean, there wasn't any... Nintendo, thank God, did not show anything about the vitality sensor, which makes me believe that they're not putting it out anymore.
346303	357917	I think they kept, what's her name, Cammy Tied up in a burlap bag backstage somewhere She was unable to be freed Hopefully sufficiently beaten Aw, poor thing She's trying to do her job
358365	359686	I don't know, what do we want to talk about?
359946	364668	Just each press conference, or do we want to... Well, I want to talk about my gaming week, because I played about 40 games this week.
365408	366049	So let's get started.
366069	366829	Well, take your time.
366969	373432	Alright, no, no, I'm not going to repeat... Oh, I will talk about something, because it is gaming related, but not video games.
374193	378455	I've been working on the baby's room some more and doing stuff regarding that.
379195	381295	I'm building a custom mobile.
381676	383996	I've actually done the wiring for it and it works perfectly.
384176	390477	Well, except for yesterday because I broke it, but that was just from trying to show people and the wire came off, but I can fix that.
391157	398778	Anyway, so I have this thing now where if I flip a switch, an on-off switch, it basically plays an MP3 lullaby of the Super Mario Bros.
398818	399099	theme.
399759	401779	At the same time, it will also spin a motor.
402719	403419	That's pretty awesome.
403439	407240	I'm going to shove it into an acrylic cube that's going to become a question block and
407820	411042	And I've started drawing on the wall.
412142	420106	I posted on Twitter and Facebook the design I have for the room, which is looking like New Super Mario Bros.
421106	423247	That sounds so adorable I could barf, honestly.
425039	441885	I'm not going to recap everything I played at the actual E3 show because we had the daily shows and I'm sure a lot of them will come up as we go over tonight's news which is going to be a little more freeform tonight and if you guys have questions in chat and during the Twitter topics and calls if you want to know if I touched a certain game I'd be happy to give you my thoughts on it
442505	443326	Thanks for watching!
461301	471328	I think it takes a lot of guts to put your game out there on the show floor at E3.
471948	480154	Guts that clearly Activision and Blizzard don't have anymore from not having their booths open to the public, quote unquote, at E3.
480214	481875	But didn't they quit E3 last year?
482855	483716	Well, they still had a booth.
484016	488818	I mean, most everything was behind closed doors at that booth, but they've been scaling further and further back.
488838	490039	But I'm digressing a little bit.
490059	497682	I could go on this whole other tangent about BlizzCon and Blizzard and how I am a big stan of World of Warcraft.
497762	498463	I love that game.
498503	499143	It's amazing.
499623	501684	I am not fucking going to BlizzCon ever.
502405	502685	Ever.
503205	503885	Because it's a joke.
504386	509148	They should have just had a big sign out front of their booth that says, Seriously, you've seen this stuff before.
509588	510369	It's just more of the same.
510389	511129	Yeah.
512509	527173	Well, anyway, I'm getting off the path a little bit, because I actually did play games that weren't just at E3, so I want to get those out of the way, because I know most of the people listening to this show didn't go to E3, so you guys are probably playing a lot of standby games to catch up on, just like I was.
527593	528413	So I will mention this.
528593	539276	I played... You might remember a couple weeks on the show, I said, I'm going to beat three games this summer, and I'm falling a little behind on my goal, but I finally found a game I want to play to completion after getting about a third of the way through it.
539896	539976	Um...
541276	546459	I played Alan Wake, which is a game that was a long time in the making.
547560	554104	It was from Microsoft Game Studios, one of their internal development teams that created the game.
554244	563349	I guess you could say it's kind of Microsoft's answer to Silent Hill, but a little less of the crazy creatures and things of that sort.
563969	593244	and a little more of the like strange paranormal sort of stuff I really like how immersive the game feels to me I like a lot of the small touches that they've done with the game like there's these little TVs that when you come across them will play little episodes of the Twilight Zone or at least kind of their version of that I think they call it Night Springs is what they call it which Shane pointed out to me is because the town name is called Bright Falls so Night Springs is like the opposite of that and I didn't catch that right away it's funny
594444	616291	I really love the fog effects are very scary and I think they're done very well and I think it's a survival horror game it's it's pretty cool it's immersive it feels like you're watching a TV show and it's been compared to Twin Peaks in other places and I think that's a very fair comparison because you have a lot of those eccentric characters strange stories WTF is going on feeling and
616671	620252	and yeah, I'm really liking Alan Wake so far.
620652	621713	It's a good game.
622313	624853	Lots of little things to collect for achievements and so forth.
626094	627834	Great environments to interact with.
628034	640778	Very large environments where you'll be walking down a trail and then suddenly you get in a car and drive to the other side of the map and this is all seamless where you kind of maybe started the mission earlier but everything has changed since you were gone.
641118	641999	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
667641	694632	so when I do beat this game I will kind of come back and let you know if I was as disappointed as some of the other reviewers were the episodic content that's coming out port 2 I think should be interesting oh yeah there's at least two coming out but they have a countdown timer in the game to when the first one's coming out by the way the game has major product placement which I found very shameless product placement like Alan Wake uses a Verizon telephone the car that he's driving in one scene has Sync by Microsoft in it
695633	712912	and Energizer Batteries are what you use in the light which is a very interesting battle mechanic it's not like Silent Hill where you kind of have to run away from everything you can do that but it's very much a kind of light versus dark sort of thing in Alan Wake and the goal is you have to you burn them down with your flashlight and then they're vulnerable to get shot
713513	737046	and you can kind of go through and kill things but you can use light from different sources not just your flashlight but you can use the headlights on a car you could attract the monsters towards a pole that has light shining from it and it would burn them down it's very interesting I'm surprised that Energizer would agree to have their batteries in a game where you have to keep collecting batteries because they keep running out really fast it's like
737846	741650	Uh, shouldn't I just collect one Energizer battery and be done with it for the whole game?
741690	744452	I mean, isn't that the message we're trying to send across?
744552	751058	Well, if you don't burn your batteries by, because like you can focus the light energy on a monster and that burns your batteries real quick.
751398	755562	But if you don't do that, you can burn them down very slowly, although it's tough to dodge them that way.
756222	758024	And then your batteries slowly recharge.
758524	762208	So if you're kind of smart about the way you do it, you don't ever burn through a battery.
762788	763109	DarkSakura.com
773038	774059	Well, maybe that's the trick.
774119	774459	I don't know.
775059	775980	So, yeah, Alan Wake.
776260	777061	I had a good time with that.
777081	779642	So that's one of the games I've been playing outside of the whole E3 show.
780223	783425	Also, we took a trip to Arcade Infinity one of the nights we were there at E3.
783465	785286	Just to go, you know, see what's new over there.
785306	787167	So what's new over there?
787528	792491	Well, new versions of all the same damn games we've been playing for 10 years.
792911	797214	I played Guitar Freaks X... What the hell are they on now?
797394	798415	X5, I think?
798555	798895	I don't know.
799195	800016	I just lost count.
800036	800196	It does.
800196	800536	It doesn't matter.
800556	803539	It's the same fucking game I played 10 years ago just with new music.
803619	804120	So whatever.
804160	804681	It was fine.
805361	806382	I played DJ Max Technica.
806402	808304	Don't the X games have like the... No way.
808344	809485	I didn't play it myself.
809526	810446	I watched Shane play it.
810587	811427	I thought I was playing it.
811447	817374	Were the X games the ones that have like the extra buttons on it or is that the different one I'm thinking of?
817634	817794	No.
817854	822639	I'm thinking of the DX ones or something or GX or I don't know what the hell it's called.
822819	823199	Who cares?
823279	824080	It's damn guitar free.
824120	825781	I played Poppin' Music The Movie.
825901	827842	I don't even know what version of the game that is.
828083	829283	It's like 16 or something.
829384	829804	Whatever.
829884	831205	I played that for a little bit.
831285	833426	You know, playing big buttons.
833766	834367	See, Konami?
834647	837149	This is the game you can put out 16 versions of.
837769	838670	Not beaten groovy.
839350	841212	I don't understand where you're getting confused.
841672	843133	How do we make this game again?
844979	851022	and then I played a little bit of DJ Max because Shane made me because I was like, oh, there's actually some songs in Technica I really like and he's like, really?
851302	852442	You gotta play DJ Max on the PSP?
852462	853142	You can play these songs?
853182	856083	And he's like, you can do four button, five button, six button.
856624	863786	So I ended up playing a little bit of that too and he was strongly encouraging me to buy DJ Max on the PSP which I might, maybe at some point.
864087	865007	There were some songs I liked.
865027	865587	It's not worth it.
866227	866448	Really?
866668	867488	I've tried it on PSP.
867528	871029	You can get it for like, with all the sales going on right now and used and everything, like 10 bucks.
871489	872370	That might be worth it then.
873110	886365	so alright so that was the games outside of E3 that I played I don't know you guys want to know just here in studio about anything at E3 were you curious about any of the stuff the games there that you might have heard I got my hands on um
887867	889808	Marvel vs. Capcom 3, did you try that at all?
890229	890589	I did.
890989	893111	They had about 10 characters playable on the show floor.
893691	894872	I got to actually play it twice.
895092	900176	The lines were excruciatingly long at Capcom's booth, but the game was also at Microsoft's booth and Sony's booth.
901937	903779	So the lines were much shorter at Microsoft's booth.
904679	905500	So I did play it.
905520	908902	I had a team of Ryu, Morgan, Felicia in one of them.
908942	913204	And I used Deadpool in another one just for Jamie because I know she'd be happy if I did that.
913664	915105	And I think I used Captain America.
915625	918427	And I'm not super into this series.
918547	920968	I was always more of a Capcom versus SNK fan.
921949	924090	But it played a lot like 2 to me.
924150	927092	It just had more stylistic graphics.
927252	927972	I like the way it looks.
928092	951985	it didn't flip into like that 3D as much as I thought it would like Street Fighter 4 does you know what I mean like I mean it's not a 3D game but you know Street Fighter 4 like a lot of it has the 3D elements it didn't do that as much as I thought it would I mean during some of the specials and so forth but I think if you're a fan of Marvel vs. Capcom 2 you're not going to be disappointed it's a high def widescreen cel-shaded stylistic game and I'm sure y'all will be happy
952561	955505	I saw the Iron Man vs. Morgan
970744	998282	well there's an extended trailer that's all those little cutscenes or whatever he has one part where he gets attacked by her she has like those like spikes or whatever that come out and he gets they hit him in the ass Dante looked like a badass character Shane was playing as Dante and he was whooping me and it took like two of my characters to bring Dante down but then I guess Chris is either really hard to use or just stinks or something because I took him out like that and then we were even again yeah
999062	1001302	Dead Rising 2, Full of Lulz
1029088	1033392	So like you could pick this up and then like he would push it into the zombie and chop him in half.
1033412	1034153	Maybe like a mulcher?
1034413	1035595	Yeah, like a mulcher type of thing.
1035615	1036375	It was awesome.
1036415	1037256	I laughed my ass off.
1037276	1038457	They had that in the first game sort of.
1038678	1038958	Did they?
1038978	1039658	Well, it was different.
1039679	1041821	It was like an actual lawnmower that I remember.
1041841	1046025	I have a feeling Dead Rising 2 is really just kind of more of the same, but we laughed.
1046145	1046625	Who cares?
1046665	1047506	It's a great formula.
1047546	1048187	We laughed and laughed.
1048207	1050969	There's only one thing they needed to do and that was just fix the save system.
1051030	1051530	That's done.
1051570	1051970	We're good.
1052831	1056993	Look at our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com if you're listening to us live on Sunday night.
1057013	1057733	Why not come join us?
1058153	1061734	There's a lot of comments from chat about questions and comments.
1062034	1067076	TigerClaw says, I like how Deadpool yells, you pressed the wrong button when he loses in the game.
1067476	1071998	I didn't see that, but it's so loud on the show floor you can't really hear a lot of the games.
1072558	1078861	I will say though, one of the soundtracks that sounded like I could hear was the Tron game that they were demoing at the Disney booth.
1079302	1080822	I played the Tron game on PlayStation 3.
1081423	1082263	Okay, here's what it is.
1082863	1087606	Imagine Prince of Persia got totally re-skinned with Tron graphics.
1088206	1089647	That's what the fucking Tron game is.
1089827	1093649	See, I thought it was more of like the Force Unleashed in the Tron universe type thing.
1093870	1094170	I know.
1094490	1095611	It played like Prince of Persia.
1095651	1100153	Like even the demo, you do the wall walking, the big flips, the jumping over objects.
1100334	1102415	It really felt like Prince of Persia to me.
1102715	1105297	But it used the Daft Punk soundtrack, like I could tell.
1105657	1107918	And so I'm like, oh, this has a sweet soundtrack to it.
1108218	1113742	It was very nice and very stylistic with the discs being thrown and everything going in slow motion.
1114102	1119965	But I think a lot of people, like Shane never saw Tron and he's kind of looking at me playing the game and he's going, the graphics in this suck.
1120425	1121746	And I'm like, it's Tron.
1121926	1124027	They're wireframe graphics.
1124047	1125747	This is what it's supposed to look like.
1125887	1126228	He'll learn.
1126268	1126648	He didn't get it.
1126668	1127068	In due time.
1127188	1127388	I know.
1127848	1128529	He'll get it someday.
1129789	1133790	Um, let's see, other questions from chat at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
1134010	1138911	Uh, some folks wanting to know, it looks like, um, uh, who's asked it here?
1139251	1142892	Um, Ray Ayanami is saying it's yet another Symphony of the Night remake.
1142912	1144773	I guess they're talking about the Castlevania game.
1144913	1147293	Oh, Tiger Claw is asking, did you play the new Castlevania game?
1147694	1148154	I did.
1148714	1148814	Um...
1149834	1162797	It does use a lot of the same skins from Symphony of the Night and it plays very similar, but yet at the same time it feels a lot different because it has what I call this Neo Geo effect where it zooms in and out of parts of the castle.
1162817	1163217	Mode 7!
1163337	1165157	Well, you can control that.
1165617	1166358	It's not arbitrary.
1166418	1171319	You control that by clicking the left or the right button, one of them.
1171979	1173379	You would actually control that.
1173779	1175980	But I found it very hard to get through the maze.
1176060	1177780	It was a hard rush for 10 minutes.
1178140	1184926	The problem with the game is that no one was really explaining the game to us and there was no on-screen rules or whatever in the demo, so we just kind of had to figure it out.
1185486	1188389	And yeah, it really did feel a lot like Symphony of the Night.
1188409	1191291	But the multiplayer element does seem to add something pretty cool to it.
1191611	1193733	And yes, you can do co-op or competitive.
1194354	1195134	So that's kind of fun.
1195274	1197616	I think it'll be a fun little arcade title.
1197857	1198878	Depends what they charge for it.
1198918	1201680	If they try to charge like $30 for it, no.
1201700	1202701	$15 is fine.
1203461	1204482	It seems like it'll be a good deal for $15.
1204522	1204863	$15 is a new $5.
1207305	1211788	The other Castlevania game I can tell was not a Castlevania game when it started.
1211948	1214450	It looked a lot more like God of War or Bayonetta.
1215350	1216871	But it's really pretty.
1217352	1218593	And it's very stylistic.
1218613	1219513	And it has sparkle ponies.
1221835	1228520	And it has Sir Patrick Stewart doing some of the voiceover works in between montages.
1228780	1230461	I want him to be a playable character.
1231181	1237926	There was this cool little sequence where you're on a wolf that's kind of riding and you can jump onto the other wolf and throw the guy off.
1238686	1241048	It's Castlevania meets God of War.
1241108	1245131	But I think if people are expecting an old school Castlevania game...
1245771	1248092	The arcade game is for you, not this new one.
1248372	1250493	This new one is a different direction for the series.
1250513	1252454	What if they call that level Operation Wolf?
1255236	1255636	Let's see.
1255816	1256897	Other comments.
1256977	1261819	Oh, it looks like some folks are asking about the 3D Castlevania game there as well.
1263080	1263600	Let's see.
1263760	1265561	Folks talking about the Tron.
1266301	1268582	TigerClaw says, hopefully the multiplayer will kick ass.
1268602	1272124	Like if they have the classic light cycle versus light cycle from the original Tron in 3D.
1272384	1273305	That's the Wii game.
1273925	1274585	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1295752	1298394	I will tell you about a couple other games just kind of off the top of my head.
1298414	1300897	There's a few that I want to talk about for sure.
1301538	1303520	A couple of them are music based so bear with me a minute.
1303860	1307404	Rock Band 3 is going to be a worthy upgrade.
1308225	1313050	They talked very quickly about some of the stylistic changes that they've made to the menus where...
1313410	1313990	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1334175	1361337	they have put in filters on the song list and I know a lot of people are wondering this all of the Rock Band songs are importable into Rock Band 3 with the exception of the Beatles which I don't think comes as a surprise to anyone but this Uber machine that they were playing on had Rock Band 2, Lego Rock Band, Green Day Rock Band I mean everything else was importable this Uber machine they were playing on had like 1300 songs it was nuts I know all about that the realistic mode
1362498	1368049	I didn't understand it at all on guitar because I don't play the guitar guitar is really confusing 120 well essentially 120 I mean I'm sure it's just like
1371678	1372679	Yeah, I don't know how to play the guitar.
1372879	1381486	I don't know how to play the guitar, but watching the guy play that White Stripes song, and then they plugged in an amp at the same time, because there's two guitar peripherals.
1381867	1388372	One of them has all the buttons, and then the other one's like a real guitar that you can use to play rock band, basically, in this special mode.
1389033	1396179	I guess they double jacked it into the game and the amp, and what they did, they turned down the game volume and turned up the amp, and he was playing the White Stripes song.
1396199	1397119	It was like the real song.
1397540	1400242	So I think this will answer a lot of people's calls, like, well, if you
1400562	1403486	and especially music snobs and people in the bands.
1403886	1405969	Rock Band isn't real guitar players.
1406029	1413637	It is funny though, that game Power Gig gets announced way back and everyone's like, oh my god, it's a game that's going to teach you how to play guitar.
1413898	1416641	And then Rock Band 3 comes out, oh, it's exactly the same thing.
1417382	1418162	Ah, crap.
1419163	1423806	But I will say one instrument I know a little more about is the keyboards and getting to see the real keyboard mode.
1423826	1425107	I was like, whoa, cool.
1425467	1437015	I do want to correct one thing I had said, speculated, I guess I should say earlier on the show, and that is when you're playing in the five bar mode, I think that's what they call it, the five bar mode, which is, you know, like regular rock band on the keyboard.
1437515	1438916	Thanks for watching!
1462630	1469552	Uh, Dr945 in our chatroom, chat.orangeandre.com, excuse me, TheDr945 says, have you guys seen the complete track list wall?
1469592	1470793	That's a lot of songs on Rock Band.
1470813	1471653	Yes, it was in their booth.
1471773	1474294	It was right across from where we were playing Rock Band 3.
1474574	1475434	It is very impressive.
1475454	1476615	And they also had a bar graph.
1477295	1479076	I don't know if that made it into the pictures as well.
1479336	1482657	That says, here's how many they have in Rock Band, here's how many are in Guitar Hero.
1482837	1483837	There's a lot less.
1485218	1485278	Um...
1487262	1507920	I really really didn't want to like Dance Central but I do the Kinect games because I kind of and I'll let Loki kind of cover Microsoft's press conference and some of the highlights and lowlights in a minute but I think a lot of us walked away from Microsoft's press conference kind of going these Kinect seem like the gimmicky crap we saw on the Wii a couple years ago
1508701	1509342	Thanks for watching!
1526613	1532134	If you've ever taken a dance class, it's basically how they break it down in a dance class.
1532354	1540876	A long time ago in high school, I took a street dance class during sophomore year or something.
1541236	1542597	And it was fun for a summer.
1543017	1551219	And basically what they do is they teach you small little bits, different techniques or whatever, and then you string it together in a routine.
1551659	1552839	And that's basically what this game is.
1552879	1555740	They teach you a bunch of small techniques and then you string it together in a routine.
1556500	1557060	Which is cool.
1557140	1564664	I think that's... I'm not sure if I would actually play this a lot because my wife would just not get it.
1565184	1566725	She would just be like, you look like a dumbass.
1567065	1567966	I could see it right now.
1569206	1570227	It would be kind of fun though.
1570607	1571808	I still may get it anyways.
1573268	1573769	God, no.
1573809	1576970	It's not going to ever appear on the internet with me in a video.
1577330	1578511	Never ever.
1578611	1580272	Unless I get really good at it.
1580332	1581393	In which case, maybe.
1581453	1582693	But even still, no.
1583353	1583454	Um...
1584554	1594142	So, I mean, that's kind of cool, and the song list looks pretty cool on it, but if we're going to compare it to, say, Dance Masters, let me put it this way.
1594242	1599287	If you took what you learned from Dance Central and actually went to a club and did it, you might look alright.
1599727	1604411	If you took Dance Masters and did what they have in that game, you're going to look like an idiot.
1605441	1620263	I don't know if I go that far because I think it was hard to see what they were and I wanted to get into Dance Masters but for me the biggest difference between the two games is yeah the style of dance was definitely different between the two but it's the song list and that's really what's going to ultimately come down to
1620803	1644946	and if just I'm sorry if Dance Masters continues down this path of DDR looking songs there's going to be a niche audience for it which is most of the people that you know have grown up with this show for the past eight years since we started talking exclusively about DDR but Dance Central will be the game that sells superior to it in America anyway I don't think Dance Central is even going to come out in Japan and I think Dance Masters will rule over there
1645026	1647908	Here's the thing though about Dance Masters and actually Dance Central.
1648148	1652812	I'd be more willing to back Dance Central because I know how Harmonix is with download content.
1653152	1654934	They will deliver on download content.
1655514	1660838	Konami, they've promised to deliver on download content for every single dance game that's come out.
1661098	1662980	Even the Karaoke Revolution games that have come out.
1664021	1666963	Never have they actually come through.
1667283	1670926	It's just been, oh, we'll put out a couple things, download content, we're done.
1671346	1671966	and DarkSakura.com.
1692712	1694774	I know I clearly said, get over it.
1694934	1697296	Para Para Paradise is never coming to the U.S.
1697456	1698858	Absolutely will not happen.
1699318	1701260	Sure enough, here we are seven, eight years later.
1701760	1704242	Dance Masters is basically Para Para Paradise.
1704723	1707865	I mean, they're going to tell you different songs.
1707925	1711829	It's not all Eurobeat, professionally choreographed, but it's still the army.
1711849	1712389	Here's my thing.
1713050	1717393	Because the only song that I saw, I mean, they have like two songs that they showed.
1717433	1718995	They showed one, it was like some...
1720216	1730203	I can understand if those maybe have like para dancing to them because it's more Japanese, you know, the para club stuff.
1730784	1739611	Now, the other songs that are in the game that say are other genres of music, you know, do those have different types of dancing, different styles?
1739631	1742293	Because that might be kind of all right.
1742813	1747417	If it's all para, like if it's para to like some, you know, pink song or something like that.
1747857	1748737	That's a little weird
1765542	1774032	I actually thought though, I will say this, I actually thought Dance Masters was the more graphically appealing game in kind of looking at them both side to side.
1774072	1781701	I mean, I think in the end, Dance Central was the more like easier to follow kind of dance, but I thought Dance Masters kind of looked better in some ways.
1782422	1783203	It's hard to explain.
1783243	1784024	I think a lot of people...
1784344	1800571	are probably going to just end up picking up both especially the crowd that I think mostly listens to this show but I think ultimately Dance Central is going to prevail in the sales here I'll check out the other one but I think Dance Masters will do better overseas well absolutely so but yeah I had a good time with those games
1801252	1802733	Those were the music games.
1802913	1804975	How about something for the non-music game fans?
1805095	1807978	Real quick, I was going to say one thing.
1808478	1814824	It wasn't shown on the floor or anything, but one of the games that I saw footage of that I thought was really awesome is DJ Hero 2.
1816405	1819889	They're going to be doing the karaoke part.
1820749	1823232	I do like all the different stuff that they have now where the
1823952	1828555	Samples that you do during the freestyle portions are actually part of the song.
1828575	1831477	It's not just crappy Flava Flav samples over top of everything.
1831957	1835860	And also the freestyle scratching, the freestyle crossfading stuff looks pretty cool.
1836800	1842724	You know what game unfortunately I did not get my hands on but Shane did and he swears it was probably one of the best games he played at the show?
1843144	1843885	DJ Hero 3D.
1845154	1847475	Yes, I actually want to pick that up.
1848136	1848676	It looks awesome.
1849076	1857080	From what I understand, it was a really great experience on the 3DS, so I wish I'd seen it myself, but no, I got to play some other stuff.
1857180	1866205	I think I played Sims 3 on the 3DS, actually, funny enough, which takes your picture and then builds your little Sims character to look like you.
1866705	1868206	Do you know how huge my nose was?
1870293	1871694	I was a little offended, actually.
1872395	1873516	That's still a pretty cool feature.
1873536	1875018	I hope they have that in the other versions.
1875618	1876299	Yeah, that's pretty cool.
1876619	1878661	I just don't want to see how fat my Sim's going to be.
1879482	1880963	Well, luckily it only takes pictures of your face.
1880983	1881804	Cannot fit on screen.
1881824	1883526	Only takes pictures of your face, luckily.
1883546	1887089	I'm like, I have more hair left than that.
1887189	1889592	That's for the 3DS version.
1889612	1892595	You never know with these Kinect cameras and moving stuff.
1893100	1894821	Harmonix, Dance Central, Dance Masters, Parapara
1914218	1925597	but when I say that it's not six streams that you break it is nothing like that at all it is tracing motions on the screen and then posing in certain ways it's like Parapar and Elite Beat Agents combined yes that's a good way of describing it actually
1926755	1926995	All right.
1927495	1929796	How about some non-music games for a minute?
1929816	1931897	Because there's one that really surprised me at the show.
1931937	1932638	They exist.
1933098	1933338	Yes.
1934018	1939901	Are you going to, by the way, Jamie, since you have the mic up for a minute, I want to ask you, is there a dance game that you're going to pick up?
1940241	1942823	Or are you like, no, thank you, I don't really want to dance, or what?
1942863	1945364	No, I think that I want to play Parapara at home.
1946064	1949506	And it's actually kind of funny because just a few days ago I was thinking about hooking up the biscuits.
1950646	1954308	No, what you should have done is done the, because you probably know the Night of Fire routine, right?
1955643	1956644	No, not by heart.
1957004	1957524	Oh, well.
1958765	1959325	What about Shane?
1959365	1960445	No, Shane doesn't play Para.
1960706	1960826	No.
1960846	1963547	I would have been able to do Boom Boom Fire.
1963587	1965668	It's probably the only one I still remember after all these years.
1965768	1972471	Hey, I went and played the Para around the corner on Arcadia, and I remembered my stuff.
1973932	1974772	I could shake my butt.
1975373	1979074	I probably could have remembered with the stuff on the screen, but why did I need to do it?
1979094	1982436	Bobby Blackwolf, there's a video of him on the internet doing the Night of Fire routine.
1982456	1983256	You should have done it.
1983316	1984377	Free publicity, Rob.
1984765	1988047	When I got up there, Shane specifically said, you better not play Night of Fire.
1988787	1989688	So I did the Smile DK song.
1989728	1990448	Thank you, Shane.
1990668	1991829	I did the Smile DK song.
1992249	1992489	All right.
1992950	1994090	I want to get past this.
1994170	2001094	I do want to say this, though, because somebody who was doing the Night of Fire dance right there at the booth the day I was there, Naoki was there on the floor.
2001114	2001815	I got a picture with him.
2001835	2002855	I got to put it on Facebook.
2003316	2007638	I promised you if I had a chance to meet Naoki, I would ask him one question.
2007938	2011080	And that question is, and this is how the interaction went, I said, you know,
2011360	2012741	Hi there, can I get a picture?
2013102	2014323	And then he said, you know, thank you.
2014383	2016224	And I said, hold on, just one question.
2016645	2019647	I said, is that Facebook really you?
2020128	2021669	And he doesn't speak very good English.
2021709	2022930	He was kind of like Facebook.
2022970	2024511	And I was like, Facebook.
2024531	2027934	And I kind of pointed at my phone because I don't know how else to describe Facebook.
2027954	2029416	I'm like, is it you?
2029596	2031758	And I'm kind of like pointing on Facebook.
2032198	2035000	And he's like, oh, yes, yes, me on Facebook.
2035901	2037943	And so, yes, that Naoki Facebook is really him.
2038257	2041080	They made the mistake, and I kind of feel bad.
2041580	2049047	They made the mistake of him actually speaking during the Konami press conference, and that was the most weird thing.
2049107	2050088	He's adorable.
2050208	2050509	Come on.
2050529	2052911	I know he's adorable, but he doesn't speak good English.
2053171	2055654	So give the guy a damn translator.
2056014	2058616	Same with the guy that was describing 99 Nights.
2059157	2062860	If you keep pushing X button and Y button, the game will suck.
2065221	2066262	Or you will be sucked.
2066882	2068082	Come on, dude.
2068182	2069522	You need a translator.
2070082	2071983	Don't just let this guy wing it.
2072263	2074003	Do not hate on Naoki on this show.
2074043	2076844	He is adorable.
2077044	2078124	You know what he looks like in person?
2078224	2079465	A hyper little kitty cat.
2079765	2082425	He was running around the stage taking little pictures with his iPhone.
2082445	2085506	He was so happy that people were playing the game and having fun with it.
2085746	2086846	He was so happy.
2086906	2087867	And more props to him.
2087967	2089547	And I know it's not his fault that...
2090207	2119177	some of the last DDR games have really been terrible and you know and I kind of feel bad in that sense because they've taken what he created and just kind of took a big dump on it like they did with Beat and Groovy but it's just it's not it's very awkward okay they had a lot of awkward moments during the Konami press conference speaking of which and I know it's just kind of like whatever Glee karaoke revolution game worst game I played at E3 yes I played it and it's terrible
2119881	2137675	and I officially don't give a crap about Glee it was one of those things when we walked in Konami's booth and I kind of looked over and I saw I mean it's huge it was no secret I was like I kind of did that moment of of course of course I should have fucking seen that coming I should have known should have had Shane play Def Jam rap star
2138656	2139437	No, no, no, no.
2140037	2141318	Here's why the Glee game was bad.
2141798	2144859	They've basically just done away with the character models and everything.
2145240	2150342	It just plays videos from Glee that sometimes match up with the song and sometimes just completely random videos.
2150722	2153724	And it just, it's, it's not that great.
2155745	2156526	I think I sat there.
2156846	2160728	I think we sang like, I don't even know what song we sang, but I was singing like this.
2160788	2161088	I was going...
2163864	2164745	Perfect!
2165005	2165586	Yep, 95%.
2166467	2168769	Granted, I was on the easiest level, but jeez.
2169369	2169649	Alright.
2169709	2169950	Alright.
2170530	2171911	Please, a non-music game.
2172032	2174294	Please, please, please, may I talk about a non-music game?
2174334	2174514	No.
2174834	2176916	Because there was a non-music game I played at the show.
2176956	2178277	Child of Eden looks awesome, by the way.
2178537	2179078	I'm done.
2179138	2179518	Shut up!
2180479	2181260	It does look very awesome, though.
2181280	2182201	There's Kinky Rockets in it.
2182261	2183262	They're doing the soundtrack.
2183322	2184843	Dude, I love Kinky Rockets.
2186024	2186264	Hey!
2187085	2187666	Hey, listen!
2189315	2189796	Who did you play?
2189836	2190817	Or did you make your own character?
2206042	2225818	it's all make your own character you cannot play as Batman or Wonder Woman or any of that they play as guys but all the raid gear quote-unquote is like clones of Wonder Woman and Superman and all that so it looks like you know we didn't get to do too much of the character creation it was all PvP but it looks like your characters can kind of go down a Batman-y path or a
2226418	2227699	Wonder Woman-y path.
2228099	2229920	And the guy who demoed it was really great.
2229980	2233482	He was one of the better demonstrators I was working with during E3.
2235163	2241347	He really was trying to kind of... He could tell we were WoW players, and he was kind of just trying to break it down, like what some of the differences were.
2241707	2247450	And he said that they don't want people to be kind of pigeonholed into these tank and healer and DPS roles.
2247470	2249111	They kind of want everybody to be able to do everything.
2249451	2250732	And I thought that was pretty cool, and
2251432	2251912	I just liked it.
2251932	2253093	It was more action-based.
2253133	2254254	Here's the thing you need to keep in mind.
2254294	2256495	DC Universe is a much more action-based MMO.
2256855	2262017	Like, the only action MMO I've really played to any extent is Phantasy Star Online and Phantasy Star Universe.
2262097	2263018	I love PSO.
2263078	2268240	But, I mean, the action in that is really super slow compared to DC Universe.
2268280	2271982	I mean, Phantasy Star is like sword, sword, sword.
2272822	2299317	DC Universe Punch, Punch, Punch, Ice Storm Drink a soda to refuel Fly up I need to get this game when it comes out November 2nd Part of the PVP we were doing was Heroes vs. Villains All the people that were out on the show floor were basically the heroes The villains were the people in the private rooms getting screened the game The guy was like, I'm really not supposed to show you this but do this
2300197	2301678	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2324153	2324754	Boom!
2325054	2330819	All of the villains went flying out of the room because the EMP device, it's like a magnet thing that pushes them all out.
2330839	2332400	And I was like, that was fucking rad.
2332460	2333541	I can have this game now, please.
2335763	2343150	And the greatest part was knowing that all those villains were the mucky muck press people in the super secret screenings.
2343510	2346973	So I had a really good time with DJ Universe, DC Universe.
2347414	2350456	So I want to pick that full game up when it comes out.
2351477	2367826	Final Fantasy XIV, we had a demo of that as well, speaking of MMOs The game looks astonishing I feel like this game is not as far along as they would like it to be I can also say, just knowing some people that are in the private alpha right now The alpha
2368726	2369787	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2385834	2386574	Thanks for watching!
2404580	2405100	Thank you!
2405300	2406921	I know, it seems like they've really fixed a lot of that.
2406941	2409283	As long as they got rid of the level cap quests, I'm good with that.
2409383	2419809	Now it's just a matter of making the game run smooth, because even in the Uber, I was noticing some frame rate issues, and I like my games to run very smoothly, so I was a little...
2420369	2424210	I don't know if this is out there a lot, but the PC and PS3 versions are not cross-server at this time.
2448177	2449617	Yeah, that's what they said last year too.
2449697	2458279	And it sounds like a lot of the reason because of that, it's not that the developer doesn't want to do it, but it sounds like a lot of the reason has to do with balancing issues.
2458599	2463180	It's really different when somebody's playing on the PS3 versus the PC.
2463540	2468481	And I do think Sony's kind of a little bit of a... Did you play it on the PS3 or the PC?
2468601	2469542	I played it on the PS3.
2469742	2472902	Yeah, PS3 was actually pretty easy to control.
2473102	2474143	Yeah, I was very surprised.
2474203	2475983	For an action-y game, it was cool.
2477828	2480509	TigerClaw in chat wants to know, and we're getting like 40 minutes into the show.
2480529	2482330	We'll get into some news here and stuff in a minute.
2482830	2485191	TigerClaw says, did you get a chance to check out the new Twisted Metal?
2485611	2490472	I watched other people play it, but I am not the big fan of the series that Loki is and so forth.
2490512	2492793	I was very excited that they talked about the new Twisted Metal.
2492813	2493233	I bet you were.
2493393	2493913	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2513732	2515634	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2533431	2537973	I do want to say some housekeeping real quick, though, because, you know, we're 40 minutes into the show, just now getting to housekeeping.
2538853	2541534	Next week is our eight-year anniversary of Orange Lounge Radio.
2542294	2543915	Actually, technically, it's during the week this week.
2543975	2552277	June 23rd, 2002 was our very first show, so happy eight week, or eight weeks, happy eight years to us next week.
2552317	2553658	Weeks seem like so long.
2554238	2557679	We're not doing anything special for it, really, just the same old thing we usually do.
2558299	2562581	But just, you know, kind of want to thank our listeners for the support over the eight years of this show.
2563541	2591301	there will be no show the week after that that next Sunday is the actual 4th of July which of course is a holiday here in the states and just due to other things we all want to do that night there will be no show on the 4th of July so that's really it for housekeeping otherwise join us on Facebook facebook.com slash orange lounge radio join us on Twitter twitter.com slash OLR we're still taking Twitter topics if you have a story you want to share or questions about E3 you want to ask mailbag is always open as well mailbag at orange lounge radio dot com
2591880	2602325	So the beginning of the show tonight, we wanted to keep it a little more freeform just in kind of wrapping up what happened at E3 and kind of summarizing the press conferences and what everybody kind of thought of the news.
2603406	2605247	Loki, what do you want to say about Microsoft?
2605267	2609989	Because they started everything off the first night before the actual floor show began.
2610430	2612611	Microsoft came out there, and in a nutshell...
2613351	2617879	focused mostly on Kinect and a bunch of games that we kind of already knew were coming.
2618219	2626232	There was no new games outside of Kinect that were announced besides the one game that I don't even remember the name of it now.
2626252	2627895	That's the type of impression it had on me.
2628591	2631273	I know what you're talking about, the Crytek Microsoft Game Studios.
2631313	2632253	Yes, that game.
2632293	2636135	That I thought was 300 The Game, because that's what it looked like, 300 The Game.
2637376	2639737	So that'll be interesting, because Crytek does some really good work.
2640698	2647161	Stuff that I thought was interesting about that press conference, and we'll go over every little detail, but just some of the basic stuff.
2647501	2656165	The ESPN stuff coming to Xbox Live Marketplace, the actual streaming, I think is kind of cool.
2657125	2665348	Not for me, perhaps, because I don't give a crap about sports, but for people that do like sports, and there's a lot of them out there, I think that's kind of neat.
2667109	2675653	The whole movie connect thing where you can control stuff just by voice command, almost like sync, and...
2676573	2678353	You know, motion gestures and stuff like that.
2678393	2678794	That's kind of neat.
2678874	2680814	Can I back up a little bit about the ESPN thing?
2680834	2683975	Because, you know, it kind of goes in that whole integrated television thing.
2684555	2686435	And I did think that was cool.
2686535	2689576	Like, I'm not into sports either as much as other people.
2690016	2694397	I thought it was, you know, I might put the local team in and just kind of try, you know, Sacramento Kings.
2694417	2697158	Because that way I'll know if my coworkers are going to be in a good mood or a bad mood the next day.
2697498	2699858	You know, I'll kind of track that in the ESPN thing.
2699878	2701919	But I don't think I'll use it for a lot more other than that.
2703340	2711507	But what really disappointed me was that when we were talking about TV integration, I think one of the things that Microsoft did so well in this past year was 1 versus 100.
2711908	2714330	And there was literally no news on that front.
2714730	2717753	Not that game, not any of the other types of games that they were talking about.
2718293	2721516	I was extremely disappointed that that subject didn't even come up.
2722168	2724270	Yeah, that's too bad.
2725611	2729174	But other stuff, obviously, Kinect was pretty cool.
2729214	2737202	They shot off a bunch of different game demo examples with that, including, of course, Kinectimals, which I think was pretty cool.
2737362	2742927	If you're going to do one of those sim animal games, that is seriously the way to do it.
2743367	2744648	To me, it was so well done.
2744688	2746950	I think it's going to be a really big game with...
2747891	2763106	And when you compare that to the eyepet stuff, it just seems a little more natural to me instead of just trying to play with this augmented reality creature type thing.
2763566	2766870	I don't know, it's like Milo in animal form almost.
2768031	2769032	I was bored watching it.
2769372	2770953	Yeah, but it's not meant for us.
2771073	2774276	Yeah, but I feel like hardcore gamers really got the shaft at Microsoft's thing.
2774416	2775357	We didn't get anything.
2775437	2777118	I mean, there's a bunch of games we already knew about.
2777138	2781502	Yeah, but they didn't have anything that was really meant for the hardcore gamer with Kinect.
2781582	2783744	And isn't that the mistake Nintendo made four years ago?
2784304	2784564	It is.
2785045	2786566	As recent as last year?
2786946	2792029	It's possibly that way, but they may be relying more on third parties to do that stuff.
2792429	2796312	But the problem is they've got the hardcore audience right now.
2796332	2799474	They're not trying to bring in more people necessarily.
2799694	2800835	They have the hardcore gamers.
2800875	2804617	They don't need to worry about the hardcore gamers leaving because there's no Kinect games for them.
2804937	2808920	They're trying to bring on the casual audience that's not playing the Xbox 360 right now.
2809620	2817721	I still kind of think, and I know some folks may argue with me and so forth, because the press conferences are for everybody and it's so that they can get the coverage and so forth.
2817742	2819242	But I'm like, but this is E3.
2819742	2820362	You know what I mean?
2820922	2827503	Even CNN, who's covering E3, sends their tech guys who play a lot of video games to E3.
2827883	2830664	And I don't think there is on the up and up on a lot of this stuff.
2830724	2836765	I mean, if Xbox wants to show off a lot of these Kinect things, I mean, I understand why it's a big part of the press conference, but...
2837145	2842289	Some of these games could have been relegated to being debuted on the Ellen Show or something for the appropriate audience.
2842349	2842829	You know what I mean?
2843209	2860341	I just feel like it's not just the 1 vs. 100 thing, but no mention of Game Room, which really doesn't surprise me, sadly, or just any other big holiday hardcore titles that we didn't already know about was a little disappointing to me.
2860762	2864444	Honestly, I think it would have been better if they never announced Gears 3 a couple months ago.
2864484	2865645	I think they should have kept it under wraps.
2867520	2875289	I don't think there was any advantage to them blowing that on the Jimmy Fallon show or whatever show it first showed up on.
2877891	2906265	um yeah I understand that but at the same time you know like I said their focus with Kinect is not necessarily the hardcore gamers they've already got them with you know the stuff that they have coming out and there will be stuff later on that will support the hardcore gamer crowd but it's just not gonna be the launch stuff it's mainly just you know more of the casual audience that they're trying to capture in and then you know maybe they'll convert some of the hardcore gamers over later on to trying that stuff um
2907992	2909753	And so there's a lot of stuff that they showed off there.
2909833	2918696	Obviously, you've got your Wii Sports clone, your Wii Sports Resort type thing with Kinect Adventures, Kinect Sports.
2919516	2920837	Seriously, Kinect Sports.
2920877	2922558	Couldn't you have done something a little bit different?
2922818	2925219	Call it Kinect Athletics or something like that.
2926159	2930661	It's just so much of almost a ripoff, you know?
2932782	2933082	DarkSakura.com
2954028	2955770	and does he look kind of pissed?
2955790	2956671	He looks sour.
2958553	2961096	That could just be a bad freeze frame though, you know?
2961576	2965160	How like a video is what, like 30 pictures a second, you know?
2965220	2965420	Yeah.
2965601	2967362	But I still think it's kind of funny.
2967643	2968123	It is funny.
2968824	2971427	I'd like to see somebody make a comic out of that.
2972385	2981668	Um, and what I was going to say, some of the stuff that they did show that's kind of borderline on the hardcore games that they showed, like integration or possible integration with Forza.
2982288	2985249	And to me, that looked just kind of dumb.
2985789	2991791	I mean, okay, look, with Kinect, you can look around a car, like a virtual car, and look at different stuff on the car.
2992331	2993011	I don't care.
2993511	2996973	Or you can drive, you know, by holding your hands in the air like a steering wheel.
2997293	2998233	My arms would get tired.
2998593	3007139	Especially, you know, gamers out there, we're not in the best shape, and that's gonna be, you know... Didn't Joyride look like Excite Truck to you, though?
3008420	3008720	No.
3008820	3010741	Joyride totally looked like Excite Truck to me.
3011722	3013443	I mean, I guess the colors and stuff are the same.
3013543	3016825	I heard Joyride was on Rails, someone was saying.
3016905	3017285	Was it?
3017365	3018806	I don't know, I didn't play it at all.
3019087	3021388	I looked like they were doing the tricks and jumping through rings and stuff.
3021408	3022589	They really reminded me of Excite Truck.
3022629	3025071	And what happened to Joyride being a free game?
3026226	3033231	Hello, it was supposed to be a free game on Xbox Live Arcade, and then with paid download content and stuff, it was supposed to be a whole new different experiment.
3034171	3037494	And they just decided, yeah, you know what, we're just going to charge $60 for it.
3037794	3038834	That game is not worth $60.
3039535	3041756	Maybe it'll be a pack-in game with the Kinect?
3041816	3052864	Because a lot of folks are speculating Kinect is $150 right now, which is fine, but, I mean, if you have to buy a game separately, then aren't you really paying $210 to play a game on Kinect?
3052964	3055425	It's the same thing if you even talk about, like,
3056947	3063011	Look at the bundles that they have right now for the PlayStation Move.
3063051	3068174	You can get a bundle that comes with the Move controller, the camera, and a game for $130.
3068214	3074398	And that's not including the extra controller that you need for some of the other games.
3074478	3078121	Kind of the nunchuck for the Move type thing.
3079001	3083164	Which you don't necessarily need, but come on.
3083464	3086006	You're going to need it if you want to be able to play everything out there.
3086826	3088006	I've been looking at pictures from it.
3109272	3110974	That's one thing that would have made me a little happier.
3110994	3112615	See, that's more of like a hardcore game.
3112675	3113376	Yes, exactly.
3113456	3116538	Why waste my time with Wii Sports clones?
3116598	3118160	We all know you're going to rip off the Wii.
3118240	3119141	Quit wasting my time.
3119181	3119941	That's just pretty.
3121262	3123304	I think they should have shown the Child of Eden demo.
3123965	3125326	But maybe it wasn't ready or whatever.
3126407	3129289	I'm just absolutely... Look, the fail whale made an appearance.
3129890	3130190	What?
3130970	3154987	I think a lot of times though with these demos they're really nervous about things going wrong like the things have to be exactly perfect case in point what happened with the Zelda demonstration Nintendo's press conference they were having a lot of problems and what's funny is that was the first thing I don't mean to skip ahead but that was the first thing Nintendo was showing at their press conference and it started to make a lot of us go here we go in Nintendo's fail conference 2010 and then Reggie just kind of was like you know
3156248	3157468	No, we'll get into that in a minute.
3157488	3159550	But definitely the tone changed quickly.
3159610	3163452	What did you think of yourself fitness on the Kinect?
3163492	3164352	I thought that was kind of neat.
3164392	3165973	I think that's Kinect's biggest strength.
3166154	3169115	I think that's where Kinect stands to make a lot of money right now.
3169135	3175859	And if they're smart, they're going to do tie-ins with the Biggest Loser TV show and some of these exercise platforms.
3175879	3177540	They do have a Biggest Loser game coming.
3178081	3180002	And who called it here on the show?
3180242	3182303	And you were like, no, they already have a Biggest Loser game.
3182323	3183024	Okay.
3184488	3185288	I'm a games analyst.
3185388	3194170	Anyway, all joking aside, I think the exercise gaming is going to be Kinect's biggest strength and I think is where they should go with it.
3194850	3197371	Get off the couch, Fatty, play some Kinect.
3197671	3202852	Other things that they had out of the conference, let's see, Fable 3.
3203592	3205513	I could care less about Fable 3.
3206313	3210834	Basically, Fable 3 to me, you could have just shown me footage from Fable 2, it would look the same.
3211674	3233696	I played what they had available on the show floor I didn't understand what the hell was going on because it was kind of in the middle of a quest already I noticed that the little golden trails were still there telling you what to do and you still had the dog and in the particular quest I was doing you got to put on a big chicken suit and I guess round up chickens and I was amused by the fact that you were in a chicken suit but yes otherwise I really didn't see anything that felt different to me than Fable 2
3235683	3240186	But, hold on, I do want to say, I mean, you make it sound like Fable 2 is a bad game, though.
3240226	3245130	I think a lot of people would be perfectly content if Fable 3 is just more Fable 2, because it was a great game.
3245150	3246831	I got bored with it after a while.
3247291	3258198	Okay, one of the coolest trailers I thought that they showed during the whole Microsoft press conference was for Metal Gear Solid Rising, where you can cut things pretty much wherever you want.
3258799	3259840	That was awesome.
3260800	3261641	Absolutely awesome.
3262301	3263382	I can get behind a game like that.
3263422	3264883	Poor Raiden and his metal jaw.
3267584	3273545	Other cool things, Reach, they were talking a little bit about some of the single player campaign.
3273585	3274645	They showed some footage from that.
3274665	3278326	It looks really epic and now they're going to have space dog fighting and stuff like that.
3278386	3279266	That'll be pretty cool.
3279826	3281866	It's going to be a great game, of course.
3285007	3289968	I don't know, other than that, I'm trying to think what else they really showed.
3292280	3295821	They didn't really talk too much about Xbox Live Arcade either, I don't think.
3296241	3302403	Well, there's a Summer of Arcade promo they're doing that has a lot of high-profile games, like the Hydro Thunder, I believe, is a part of that.
3302863	3308024	And the Hydrophobia, I think, is in there too, and the Castlevania game that we talked about a little earlier.
3308384	3311145	You know, that's back, and that's kind of where Arcade's going.
3311605	3317467	I was personally disappointed in the lack of Game Room news, and I think just further cements the fact that I think Microsoft's already written it off.
3318075	3318115	Um...
3326260	3327281	Yeah, I think that's about it.
3327942	3332166	Of course, the new Xbox looks kind of sexy and stuff.
3332766	3334268	All the rumors are true, of course.
3334728	3343116	Please, America, Europe, Japan, everybody out there listening to the show, Canada, stop calling it the Xbox 360 Slim.
3343877	3344717	It's not slim.
3344798	3345538	Have you seen it?
3345859	3348621	Have you seen it next to the old Xbox 360?
3349001	3349902	It's still fat.
3351864	3357250	That's like saying a guy who went from 300 pounds to 280 pounds is now skinny.
3357851	3359433	I mean, they're still fluffy.
3360414	3366220	And not that there's anything wrong with that, not that there's anything wrong with the new Xbox 360, but it is not slim enough.
3367041	3368702	Thanks for watching!
3383992	3396902	and then of course you know it has the integrated GPU CPU into one chip and the internal 250 gigabyte hard drive which I heard was actually you can interchange it like the PlayStation one but I'm not positive.
3397523	3406830	That's what I'm hearing too is that it's not as hardwired in there as the old drives were but here's the thing I don't think those systems are for the people who already own Xboxes.
3406850	3407270	Yeah it's for
3408351	3411514	It's to piss off those of us that just bought an Xbox a few months ago.
3411674	3412014	Thank you.
3413935	3415617	It's a push into the holiday season.
3416778	3420761	All it is is basically just an upgrade to the current stuff that they have out there.
3421181	3424443	You bet your ass they're going to do another fucking price drop in the fourth quarter.
3424543	3426565	You might as well just wait.
3427446	3429867	Seriously, they're going to do another price drop.
3430568	3435171	I think they've already said that they're going to be doing something new towards the holidays.
3436232	3437113	Just be patient.
3438553	3438853	All right.
3439293	3441955	So anything else you want to say about Microsoft or Microsoft-related stuff?
3443816	3444436	DarkSakura?
3444576	3445236	Booty shaking.
3446457	3448218	She's going to be picking up a Kinect to shake her booty.
3448238	3448598	That's fine.
3449138	3449398	All right.
3449758	3450599	How about Nintendo?
3450739	3457342	Let me give you my impression of Nintendo's press conference this year because, you know, Nintendo, everybody's expectations were very low for Nintendo.
3457642	3465826	You know, everybody was expecting something more on the 3DS, but I think other than that, everybody kind of went in there with their expectations low, but it basically went something like this.
3466326	3467928	Reggie Fils-Aimé comes out on stage.
3468568	3470510	Hi, I'm Reggie Fils-Aimé.
3470851	3473333	Prepare to have your minds fucking blown.
3473873	3476396	Here's the new Zelda game we've been talking about for a little while.
3476936	3479499	And now, here's a new Wii game, Kirby.
3479779	3481541	Here's a new Wii game, Goldeneye.
3481961	3483042	Who doesn't love Goldeneye?
3483262	3485044	Here's a new Wii game, Donkey Kong Country.
3485304	3489649	Here's a new Wii game... I mean, he's just naming game after game after game after game.
3490169	3493911	and then, oh, and by the way, the Wii is still selling well.
3494252	3497714	All those reports about the people are not buying games for the Wii are bullshit.
3497934	3500195	So don't you ever talk fucking bad about my system again.
3500415	3502176	Here comes Iwata to tell you about the 3DS.
3503317	3505158	That was basically what the press conference was.
3505659	3508480	And then they talk about the 3DS and it's real, y'all.
3508900	3513383	I mean, having seen the thing in person now, I can tell you it really does work.
3514544	3516065	It's a pretty impressive piece of technology.
3518123	3522845	Here's how I interpreted the press conference.
3523226	3525567	The Zelda game came out and they were showing off stuff.
3525767	3530849	Honestly, they should have just shown a trailer because I could care less watching him try to play the damn Zelda game.
3531590	3533491	And I do like the way it looks.
3533671	3538473	It's kind of a cross between Wind Waker and Twilight Princess.
3538593	3541735	I like how it's very colorful.
3542055	3547718	It's got that kind of cel-shaded look to it, but it's still... It looks like cel-shaded watercolor.
3549506	3550627	That's my take on it.
3550908	3556236	It's more pastel-y and less like toilet water filter that the last game had.
3556616	3560542	Well, it looks like a Wii game and not like, oh look, it's a GameCube game.
3561263	3563807	Or even a Nintendo 64 game or something like that.
3564267	3565607	So that's cool.
3566608	3571149	The demonstration, though, they seriously needed to cut down that demonstration because it was not exciting.
3571169	3572009	It did go on a little long.
3572049	3572549	It was long.
3572589	3576690	But they know people are excited about Zelda, and that was one of the big things that everybody wanted to hear about.
3576811	3581372	But SSJ100Matt in our chatroom says, By the way, Reggie has gotten more and more chubby each E3.
3581412	3582772	He hasn't been playing his Wii Fit.
3583152	3589274	Dude, SSJ100Matt, I would be careful because Reggie will bring out some charts and fuck your shit up if you decide to...
3589674	3596347	I'm sorry, I don't buy his, oh, people haven't been playing the Wii, or people are playing the Wii and all that stuff.
3596948	3597669	Where's your data?
3598491	3600715	You coming out here and saying this, I don't buy it.
3600735	3601677	He cited MPD figures.
3602537	3606040	Yeah, MPD figures, they cover what games are selling.
3606681	3618411	And yeah, I'm sure a lot of people are buying Super Mario Galaxy and that kind of stuff, but every other game of other genres, like say some of the hardcore games and whatnot, those are not selling well.
3619312	3626798	And I can't say that the whole system is a success, but it's definitely certain genres are doing well and certain ones are not.
3628060	3643320	it's perhaps just because they don't have all I don't think they have the hardcore demographic they have kind of like the families playing the game and the people that are big Nintendo fanboys playing just the Nintendo products and that's about it um
3644215	3651962	I think a lot of folks in chat are wondering, because they know I'm a hardcore Kid Icarus fan from back in the day, what I was thinking when that Project Sora thing happened.
3652322	3653563	You can pretty much imagine it.
3653603	3654584	My jaw was on the floor.
3655104	3659708	And then as they were announcing it, I was like, oh my god, this makes perfect sense.
3659748	3661370	This is why they kept it such a big secret.
3662951	3664332	The whole Kid Icarus thing made perfect sense.
3664492	3670077	And it was really the defining moment of Nintendo's press conference for me, where I was like, oh my god, they're back.
3670197	3670638	Thank you.
3671098	3677840	Whoever hid Cammy under the rafters and whoever put the Wii Vitality Sensor somewhere far, far away, thank you so much.
3678020	3679200	Mario Sports is kind of dumb.
3680320	3680700	Played it.
3681340	3683841	It's a kid's game.
3684641	3685561	I wasn't a huge fan of it.
3686562	3689763	I did think Wii Party was better than a lot of people are passing it off as, though.
3690443	3698625	But the interesting thing is, my question is, if the 3DS is not coming out this holiday season, which I don't know, I kind of think it's not going to.
3699465	3699885	I think it is.
3700765	3705346	Well, I mean, and the one good reason I'm hearing for why it is coming out this holiday season, what else does Nintendo have?
3705786	3709307	Because we know Zelda got pushed back to 2011, so what are the big releases?
3709387	3710807	Goldeneye, that'll be a big title.
3710847	3711587	Kirby, I think.
3711627	3713488	Kirby, which was certainly worthy.
3713608	3717669	Epic Mickey, so they're putting a lot of stock in a third-party title, but it's a worthy title.
3717769	3718889	I did play a little bit of that, too.
3718909	3719509	It looks very good.
3720729	3723930	Wii Party, I think, will be one that they really back this holiday season.
3724770	3726013	for more short attention span folks
3736480	3737401	Kirby looked okay.
3737721	3742085	I never really have been a big fan of Kirby, but I definitely like the style of the game.
3742405	3743266	It's definitely unique.
3743286	3745188	There's nothing out there like it.
3745668	3746629	So that was kind of cool.
3747230	3751653	Wii Party, my mind turned off during the whole Wii Party thing.
3751693	3752314	I just don't care.
3753115	3753555	It's fine.
3753775	3760161	You play these little mini games, and what's funny is that one of them looks just like that rafting game they were showing in Microsoft's Adventures thing.
3760601	3761863	But it was funny.
3761943	3769193	We played this boat stacking game where you had to stack people on a boat and the size of the people was determined on how well you did in the minigame.
3769574	3776203	And Shane and I were getting competitive and we were cracking up when all the people were falling off the boat.
3777775	3778455	You know what's funny?
3778555	3782716	Metroid Other M just kind of had to be on the same level as all these other games.
3782756	3783437	I mean, don't get me wrong.
3783457	3785137	I'm still really excited about that game.
3785577	3790959	But there was so much for Nintendo to show that this year Metroid wasn't able to stand out like it did last year.
3790999	3798061	Metroid Other M, and it's sad with the people I'm talking to, don't really seem to understand how awesome this game is going to be.
3799141	3800701	I think it looks really, really cool.
3800921	3803002	So it'll be interesting to see when that comes out.
3804363	3805503	The new Donkey Kong game.
3805603	3808144	I kind of like how they're going back to the old school stuff with that.
3808605	3809285	See, that's the thing.
3809465	3813067	Even with new Super Mario Bros., you don't have to reinvent the wheel.
3813327	3816569	Just put out a good game that's in that genre.
3816589	3819130	You don't even have to go all brand new with it.
3819170	3822752	Just a new game.
3823172	3824253	I played the new GoldenEye game.
3824293	3824913	It's a lot of fun.
3825373	3827774	I played this odd job and kept killing Shane with my hat.
3827874	3828415	It was a lot of fun.
3829275	3829696	Good times.
3830278	3831079	You threw a shoe?
3831420	3832021	Seriously?
3832382	3833304	Who throws a shoe?
3834387	3834828	It was fun.
3834948	3835349	It was fun.
3835389	3835830	I had a good time.
3836491	3837133	With Goldeneye.
3838744	3839884	Thank you for watching!
3860050	3865714	There was a stage that we were looking at during the demo where you get sent by one of the characters to collect masks.
3866514	3873159	And what you can do is you can go collect one mask, take it to him, and he'll say, okay, now get me two more.
3873659	3885087	And what you can do is you go around to the back of the shop, use your thinner to break down the door so you can just go into the back of the shop, take that same mask you just turned in, then go back to the front of the store and say, here's mask number two.
3885547	3889370	And he'll go, hmm, I don't remember them coming in a set, but okay, and he'll give you credit.
3890030	3917971	so you can play the game as kind of like good Mickey or bad Mickey which really surprised me that you'd be able to do that in a Mickey Mouse game you know what I mean like Mickey's supposed to be like now here's the thing heart of gold remember how they have like the concept art for epic Mickey and they have the really twisted creepy ass looking characters were any of them in there because it seems to me that they really like g-rated the whole damn thing it's not as like cool and epic as it was before
3918471	3920292	Um, yes and no.
3920432	3930735	I think a lot of that just wasn't in the demo they were showing on the show floor, but with the whole pate thinner angle and the fact that Mickey can be deceptive, I think it could be in there.
3931235	3932515	We just didn't see it at E3.
3933375	3935196	I wouldn't lose hope on that front yet, Loki.
3938467	3947373	As far as Nintendo goes, I do want to talk just a minute about the 3DS because I know a lot of people are really curious about what the system kind of feels like.
3948934	3952317	Don't expect things to fly out at you like in some of those commercials.
3953197	3959401	Imagine you're kind of like looking out this window or looking down a hallway that has depth that kind of goes in.
3959862	3961543	That's what the 3DS kind of looks like.
3962023	3963824	I don't know how they do the technology.
3964004	3966085	I don't know if it's functioning on prisms is what I hear.
3966145	3971568	No, it's basically they've got a different layer on there that directs light to both your eyes.
3971908	3978832	It's like, you know how interlaced TV works, how they have different lines that update every so often?
3979112	3987017	Well, imagine that but vertical and instead of it being updated differently, half of those lines are going to your right eye, half of those lines are going to your left eye.
3987037	3987537	That's crazy.
3988299	3991967	It's basically like... What do they call it?
3994693	3995475	Not a lithograph...
3998960	4001682	Lenticular.
4003102	4006424	Have you ever seen those boxes for Saw, for example, the 3D one?
4006684	4007445	Final Destination 3D.
4007465	4020512	That one that they had where you look at it and it looks like the stuff's kind of popping out because they've got basically this piece of plastic that has ridges on it that acts like a prism and pushes it to your left eye and right eye.
4020852	4021832	That's basically how it works.
4022172	4024314	They focus the image to two different eyes.
4024334	4025094	Cool.
4025254	4028057	It's like the Virtual Boy, but less headache-inducing.
4028237	4029078	Well, let me tell you, though.
4029138	4029878	The red migraine box?
4030419	4032641	The best thing... I noticed the pull on my eyes.
4033121	4036665	And I was kind of like, okay, this is not going to be a healthy thing for me to play for a couple hours.
4037025	4038266	Here's the best thing about it.
4038947	4042630	There's a slider that you can adjust the intensity of the 3D.
4042990	4046173	And if the 3D gets too gimmicky and too dumb for you, you just turn it off.
4046554	4047355	Presto Chango 2D.
4048314	4051496	One of the demos they were showing was Disney's Tangled, one of the movies.
4051556	4052597	I guess it's out in theaters.
4052617	4053717	They had a little trailer.
4053737	4056439	And that was some of the most impressive use of 3D they had.
4069020	4071623	I was not seeing artifacting or anything on the screen.
4071663	4072864	It was only the top screen.
4073164	4074606	Didn't really use the bottom screen at all.
4075026	4077128	But this will be great for kids.
4078990	4079931	Even some adults, too.
4080612	4086839	I don't think they're talking about a lot of adult movies on the 3D technology yet, but certainly the kid stuff, I think there's going to be a lot of people...
4087259	4093364	And of course, the developers list, which I'm not sure if we're getting into later, but lots of cool stuff.
4093524	4095366	All the big games, Mario Kart and stuff.
4095866	4099149	Wish they had a WarioWare game right there.
4099809	4104033	Still, if you go by the golden rule of gaming, a system is only as good as the games that are on it.
4104113	4105854	This thing has the games to back it up.
4106755	4108957	The cartridges are different from the regular DS.
4109317	4112700	The graphical power felt more like a PlayStation 2 in there.
4112880	4114161	Not quite at that level.
4114221	4116583	I don't think especially a lot of the rendering will be...
4117624	4121986	The Kingdom Hearts little demo I saw looked like the freaking game on the PS2.
4122847	4127109	A lot of it is going to be pretty impressive.
4127209	4129191	There's the games to back it up at the end of the day.
4130612	4135254	It's not like the PlayStation Move where I can't think of a single game I really want to buy the Move for.
4136795	4138396	And Kinect, I'm kind of teeter-tottering.
4138436	4140238	I'm like, well, I guess there's the two dance games.
4141118	4143459	Connect, I'm actually planning on picking up.
4143840	4148402	And I actually kind of want to pick up the Connect Adventures thing because I think that would be a fun party game.
4150163	4152645	The Dance Central stuff, I think that would be pretty fun.
4153145	4156567	The fitness game, I'm not sure because I bought Wii Fit.
4156607	4158488	I'm like, oh, I'm going to do that and stuff.
4158668	4162590	I need an excuse to work out.
4163611	4165692	But I don't know if I'd actually do that.
4166172	4169135	It's just like, games like that make me feel, like, awkward, you know what I mean?
4169315	4176181	Whereas, like, you can do, I mean, playing DDR, I guess, would be kind of awkward looking, too, but I never felt awkward playing the game, you know what I mean?
4177201	4178683	So, I don't know.
4179564	4179824	Alright.
4180684	4185168	Let's move on, I guess, then, to Sony, if we've kind of talked enough about the 3DS and so forth.
4185989	4187070	What did Sony do, Loki?
4187090	4187170	Okay.
4188141	4194851	Um, Sony had, of course, their, their big thing was, uh, they showed off the move stuff and 3D.
4195552	4196874	3D was the big thing for them.
4196914	4203043	Of course, they were talking about partners, um, with third comp, you know, third party companies for different 3D things.
4203604	4218146	Now it's a little deceptive in how they were talking about 3D because certain games like Crysis 2 will not only be 3D on the PlayStation platform, they will be 3D also on the Xbox 360 as well.
4219688	4235058	Not all games, though, I think, were going to be 3D, but as one of their big focuses, obviously the 3D Blu-ray is going to be available with a firmware update, which that is pretty cool because if you don't have that, you would have to actually buy a whole new Blu-ray player.
4237420	4247947	Also, they were showing off some new games, different franchises, like Twisted Metal was one of the big ones that they announced, which is kind of cool, Motorstorm Apocalypse, which I think looks pretty fun.
4250749	4265999	LittleBigPlanet 2 I got some hands on time with on the show floor and the level we were playing was a race level but it introduced the grappling hook and not only could you grapple on certain parts of the scenery but you could grapple the other players and that made it a lot of fun we had a lot of fun with that
4266619	4276741	Otherwise, stylistically, it really just looks like the first game, and graphically, but this upgrade is really more about the extra tools that are in it than anything else, which I think most people do.
4276761	4284443	I do like how you can have good control over everything, how you can make puzzle games and top-down action games or whatever, RPGs.
4285604	4286404	That's pretty cool.
4287024	4294746	So, it'll be interesting to see what levels are created by that, because I know I'm pretty creative, but I just don't have time to do it, so...
4295566	4300450	Thankfully, there's a community of millions of players out there to do it for me.
4301992	4302252	I don't know.
4302272	4306876	There wasn't a lot at Sony's press conference that really made me jump up and down and scream, except for Kevin Butler coming on stage.
4307056	4307677	That was awesome.
4309518	4310619	I know what makes me giddy.
4310819	4311200	What's that?
4312101	4312701	The P word.
4313482	4314062	The P word?
4314663	4315924	The second of the P words.
4317683	4318245	You lost me.
4318425	4319046	Portal 2.
4319547	4320910	Ah, Portal 2, of course.
4320951	4321712	How could we forget?
4321752	4327405	That was the big ending to Sony's press conference where Valve is basically saying...
4327994	4331576	Oh yeah, I guess we will make stuff for the PlayStation 3 after all.
4331657	4333598	That's basically what it was.
4333638	4334638	We'll stop ignoring you.
4335199	4345465	But I think even more so than just the fact that Portal 2 is coming out for the system is more the fact that Steam is going to have some integration with the PS3.
4345525	4349168	That was the biggest newsworthy thing to me.
4349208	4350949	Did you see the trailer for Portal 2?
4351109	4351729	I sure did.
4351989	4352590	You monster.
4353030	4353451	I know.
4353851	4364643	But now, I've watched, and we were actually able to, you know, we've got our TV out front with a computer hooked up to it so we can watch YouTube videos at the high res.
4365605	4369970	And we watched the playthrough demonstrations.
4370870	4398631	and that was really exciting but there was also an interview that G4 had up with one of the designers talking about the story that you know you didn't escape it's in the future the far future and you're still there oops and but it's gonna have they they said that there's gonna be they're actually in the playtesting part for both of the storylines and
4398891	4399372	I noticed that.
4399392	4401895	I thought that was pretty cool and makes sense for a game like Portal.
4401995	4404057	It would be very hard to integrate them both in the same game.
4415811	4423114	But by the way, just kind of in case it hasn't already been mentioned or you didn't hear, you know why that Portal 2 party got canceled after all?
4423134	4424975	It wasn't because Valve wanted to show something else out.
4425315	4427996	They were going to announce the PlayStation thing at that party.
4428636	4438660	But Sony came to them and said, you know, basically in so many words, actually, could you wait and come out on stage at our press conference?
4438860	4440581	That's why no Portal 2 event happened.
4440921	4441041	Okay.
4442639	4447242	Killzone 3 looked awesome, and I can only imagine what that looks like in 3D, so that was kind of cool.
4449344	4453947	The PlayStation Move stuff, I just couldn't get too excited about what they were showing.
4454707	4467796	I know it's going to have support for SOCOM 4 and stuff like that, and I know that they have a new Time Crisis game, which, by the way, never forget that they did come out with a gun con for the Time Crisis game.
4468096	4470138	What a waste of money that was.
4470698	4471679	Thank you, Namco.
4472559	4475960	Did you hear that in the Time Crisis game there's going to be a mode that's off-rails?
4476701	4478681	I'm like, that's not Time Crisis.
4479041	4479741	What do you mean it's off-rails?
4479761	4480362	They had that in the last one.
4480402	4480842	Did they really?
4481002	4481282	Yeah.
4481302	4482002	Oh, I didn't know that.
4482062	4493466	But see, the gun con in the last one was actually pretty cool because they did have, you know, the kind of a dual grip for it and they had, you know, one analog stick on your, you know, left hand where you'd be holding it at the front of the gun and the right analog...
4493886	4494387	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4506850	4509291	New Time Crisis Game, and whoop-dee-shit.
4510191	4511972	Where the hell did The Last Guardian go?
4512172	4515213	That was one of the big standouts from last year, and it just kind of disappeared, didn't it?
4515233	4518994	Yeah, they didn't mention anything, but it's supposed to be still coming out.
4519154	4520615	Hmm, I found that to be a little strange.
4521195	4521775	Maybe it was just me.
4522495	4523296	I was very disappointed.
4523316	4525416	It's still on my list for November.
4526497	4526957	Interesting.
4527017	4529818	I like how Gran Turismo 5 has a date again.
4530178	4532459	Let's see if they actually hit that date this time.
4534963	4535443	We'll see.
4536403	4538964	All right, so I guess we're done with press conferences.
4539084	4542765	Let's kind of go around and see what everybody's... Oh, you have something else you want to add?
4542785	4545885	No, I want to talk about some of the other smaller press conferences real quick.
4545905	4546306	Sure, sure.
4546426	4547606	Just make a quick mention.
4547746	4548246	Please do.
4557288	4559429	It wasn't really called a vitality sensor.
4559569	4580436	I forget what they were calling it, but it was like a breathing, relaxing game or something, which I thought was funny because I wonder if that, you know, you would think that they aren't actually coming out of the vitality sensor now since that thing basically is the vitality sensor and that, you know, Nintendo would be suing them if that were the case.
4581096	4582057	So that was interesting.
4582097	4584458	They showed a lot of games that weren't really games.
4584498	4589001	Like, they had a PC laser tag game, but all the PC did was basically keep score.
4589061	4596845	It was actually, you know, a real laser tag, like, pack and crap that you bought and put on and went and shot your friends and stuff like that.
4597446	4600767	And Joel McHale looked really awkward hosting the Ubisoft thing.
4601148	4602769	The new Rayman game looks awesome.
4603109	4603689	Have you seen that?
4603789	4604610	The episodic one?
4604630	4604790	Mm-hmm.
4605490	4610655	It's all really pretty hand-drawn and just really awesome.
4611336	4619764	And then the last one that they showed, which also was kind of weird, and it was funny because they were saying it wasn't really a game.
4622146	4649917	was Mania Planet which I'm kind of a fan of the Track Mania series but they're going to be having two new PC titles that you're going to be able to make your own custom games out of Shoot Mania which is going to be like a first person shooter kind of editor creator type thing and RPG Mania which you'll be able to make your own RPG type games and of course a new Track Mania game that's going to be coming out which looks very pretty so those are pretty cool
4651857	4652877	That's pretty much it for right now.
4653437	4653757	Alright.
4654598	4655138	Let's go around.
4655198	4663639	I just kind of want to get everybody's thoughts on the, you know, in your opinion, the best thing about E3 and the worst thing about E3.
4665080	4665580	I'll start.
4666260	4669821	The best thing about E3 was by far the 3DS.
4670101	4676502	I mean, just actually getting to see it and use it and behold this new piece of technology was really something else.
4676562	4680263	Even if the lines the first day were pretty ugly, but they got a little more manageable as the show went on.
4680683	4681884	So I would say the best thing was by far 3DS.
4682905	4691854	Worst thing about E3 was flaky flakes like Activision and Blizzard, you know, being under the same umbrella, just deciding they don't even need a booth anymore.
4692555	4694437	I realize they had their own off event.
4694537	4701023	I realize they think they're at a level where they can just not put up with the show of E3, but I just, I don't know, it's kind of...
4702144	4703225	I get... Sounds tacky.
4703546	4704547	It's a little tacky to me.
4704747	4709171	I mean, they're kind of reeking of that kid who takes the ball and goes home because they don't like the rules of the game.
4709231	4711914	You know, it's just... It's unfortunate, I think.
4712294	4723925	And just the fact that Blizzard will not show anything at E3 because basically they can charge people $150 who will go see it at their own convention and then the tickets get scalped on eBay so basically people are really paying like $400.
4725206	4729470	to go see these demos of games they're going to end up buying regardless anyway.
4730110	4736896	Personally, I think BlizzCon's a big fat joke, but I guess I'll save that rant for another edition of OLR.
4738737	4740359	Anyhow, best and worst of E3.
4740399	4740599	Loki.
4743236	4749024	I kind of have to agree with the Activision thing, just because I wish there was more coverage of the Activision games.
4750225	4758916	To me, and you were mentioning BlizzCon and stuff, a lot of the stuff that Activision does seems like a cash grab, and believe me...
4759517	4768103	If they had thought about the whole charging people for online play when you buy a used game first, they would have been doing it first.
4768763	4775387	And I have a feeling they're going to be falling suit with that because they can make a lot of money off those Call of Duty games, Black Ops and whatnot.
4776468	4778649	Speaking of which, Black Ops looked fucking awesome.
4779010	4780070	Or no, it wasn't Black Ops.
4781471	4782572	Future Warrior, actually.
4782612	4786194	They were showing off the new Ghost Recon game looked awesome in the Ubisoft thing.
4786595	4786775	I mean...
4787835	4788236	Really cool.
4789897	4796142	One of the best moments of E3, I think, was when Kevin Butler came on stage and did his little rant.
4796262	4797443	That was actually really cool.
4797483	4799405	Completely scripted, well-acted rant.
4799585	4800125	I don't care.
4800906	4801907	He's a great actor.
4801967	4803008	He's funny.
4803868	4811455	I have no problems with... I understand he's not a real... He's a real person, but he's playing this character, and that's fine.
4811795	4813676	I think it's a great advertising ploy.
4815751	4816571	So that was really cool.
4816792	4817512	You know what's funny?
4818753	4823175	I was talking to Bobby about this one of the nights, and Shane was probably there too, and we were talking about this.
4824116	4831219	Many years ago here on the show, maybe a couple years ago, I kind of said one of the problems Sony's having right now is that they don't really have a good voice.
4831880	4837162	Xbox 360 has Major Nelson, Nintendo has Reggie Fils-Aimé, but who does Sony have?
4837223	4839424	Sony has not really had a spokesperson.
4839824	4841505	But they sure do now, don't they?
4841965	4843606	My how a lot has changed in a year.
4843886	4846588	It seems to me like the Stephen Colbert of the video game world.
4846848	4847288	I'm sorry.
4847448	4847709	Yes.
4848609	4850731	I need to retract my Activision thing.
4851251	4852852	Activision was not the worst part.
4853172	4855374	And sadly enough, it does tie in with Kevin Butler.
4855714	4859056	Who the fuck is this new kid pimping out the PSP stuff?
4859256	4861078	He is so fucking annoying.
4861778	4865300	Why would you even have someone else handling that when you have Kevin Butler?
4865601	4871264	It's like, hey, look, we have this fine caviar, but instead we're going to serve you dog shit on a plate.
4871525	4873506	I mean, why would you do that?
4874026	4874667	Why would you?
4875227	4876348	You're going backwards.
4876388	4878210	You took a big step backwards with this kid.
4878230	4880271	At the end of the day, they still eat crayons.
4880371	4881893	Kevin Butler or not, remember that.
4882173	4883654	Sony's still eating crayons.
4883954	4887077	I understand, but seriously, what the hell?
4887117	4889279	Rob, you gotta admit, the kid wears the bicycle helmet.
4889779	4892181	And then they played like two commercials with him in it.
4892221	4893322	I'm like, stop.
4893522	4894923	I already hate him already.
4896064	4896945	Enough to be redundant.
4898820	4900241	SSJ100 Matt in our chat room.
4900281	4901001	Exactly right.
4901481	4906563	Chat.OrangeLawnTrader.com says, Seriously, think of the games they could have shown instead of Kevin Butler's rant.
4906703	4908084	But it was an epic time-killing moment.
4910145	4912906	Toa Gak believes that dog shit is actually better than caviar.
4912966	4915087	Alright, fine.
4915988	4923791	We can serve you filet mignon wrapped in bacon in the most delicious food you could possibly ever have or a steaming pile of dog shit.
4926610	4930834	In fact, we'll just put the dog over your face and he can shit straight into your mouth.
4931254	4932555	So it's absolutely fresh.
4932855	4934737	Loki, we get it.
4934897	4935337	God.
4936218	4937039	I don't think you do.
4939521	4940702	Well, I'm done with that.
4941142	4943084	This dog has been constipated forever.
4943144	4946487	Don't make me bring out the Dalek.
4946807	4947768	DarkSakura, please.
4948068	4951071	The best thing about E3 for you and the worst thing about E3 for you.
4951528	4956329	It's a combination of getting my little bit of Portal 2 crack.
4957129	4958710	Because you know I've been waiting for that.
4959630	4962230	Did they say anything about Half-Life 3?
4962270	4968272	That's what I wanted to ask.
4968312	4968832	You're funny.
4969452	4971312	Valve acknowledging Half-Life.
4971412	4971932	That's funny.
4972453	4972973	No, they didn't.
4974293	4974593	Anyway.
4977245	5001427	and the other good thing would be Kid Icarus with the 3DS so yay and the worst thing is there was no me there that was pretty awful so I couldn't have my epic running into Kojima but he wasn't there anyway that's why you couldn't go it's a constant in the universe that every E3 that I go to I have to run into Kojima literally
5003112	5022534	and you know what else is kind of dumb not quite the worst thing of E3 what are they doing with the PSP oh look we have a new God of War game props to you, new God of War game awesome they're still trying to kind of recover from that whole PSP go debacle I think Sony's going to save that PSP 2 for next year guaranteed there'll be a PSP 2 next year
5023345	5024167	They're gonna have to.
5025068	5025329	Alright.
5025409	5026571	They can't lose by much more.
5027292	5028434	How about some release dates?
5028474	5036128	Because meanwhile, while expos are going on, there's still games coming to a store near you, and we probably should acknowledge some of the upcoming releases!
5037577	5040919	Yes, this week there's going to be some Transformers.
5042380	5059110	The Cybertron Wars will be coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, the Wii, and of course two versions on the DS because they have to have one for every faction and one on the PSP, one on the PC.
5059790	5061492	Way too many Transformers, but that's fine.
5062972	5085649	Also this week, crappy DS games including Western Riding Academy Awesome, because there's no horse riding games on the DS at all TNA Cross the Line, that's going to be coming out on PSP and DS this week Just Sing, it's a karaoke game for the DS that comes with a microphone That plugs into your DS so you can look like a tool on the subway
5087110	5089472	10-Minute Solutions coming from Activision.
5089612	5092755	It's their fitness game based off a DVD exercise series.
5093976	5099560	Wipeout based off the, I guess it's a popular TV show on DS and Wii.
5099621	5100541	Thank you, Activision.
5102543	5106386	Why can't they just have Takashi's Castle the game?
5107307	5110069	I know they did way back in the day, but a new one.
5110270	5111090	That would be kind of cool.
5112840	5113881	Ah, the Wii.
5114481	5115521	What junk you have.
5116442	5120503	Calvin Tucker's Redneck Racing on the Wii from Zoo Games.
5120663	5121424	Thank you very much.
5122744	5126546	And some generic brain training games.
5128027	5129387	Think Smart on DS.
5129527	5132949	And then they also have Think Smart Kids on DS.
5133029	5134389	And then that's also on the Wii.
5134409	5135670	Okay.
5137799	5138520	Let's see here.
5138540	5139320	A couple more.
5140201	5144085	Field and Stream Total Outdoorsman Challenge on the Xbox 360.
5144325	5145927	Puzzle Quest 2 on the DS.
5147268	5149210	That's going to be the old school Puzzle Quest game.
5149250	5153354	None of this crappy hexagon space Puzzle Quest crap.
5154175	5155336	Play that at the show.
5155376	5156557	It has a lot of new mini games too.
5156917	5157117	Yes.
5157878	5165822	And then finally, an actual game from Nintendo and kind of a cult classic, or soon to be a cult classic, Sin and Punishment Star Successor, coming out this week.
5166162	5167983	Get it now before it's gone.
5168323	5168523	Yeah.
5169264	5170064	So, that's it.
5170504	5173366	If you want Nintendo to put out more titles like that, you might want to get it now.
5173506	5179089	Although it does look like Nintendo's got a lot of, I guess you could say, hardcore quote-unquote games coming out for the rest of the year.
5180066	5181928	Monster Hunter Frontier Online Online Adventure
5197626	5207915	I would probably stop short of saying MMO, but you're going to have 11 different types of weapons and you'll be able to use the Xbox 360 live basically to go into a plaza, chat with other hunters for tips.
5208335	5212359	Capcom's going to be regularly updating the game, so keep an eye on that one.
5212419	5215462	I bet if anybody's importing a game, that would be one of them.
5215902	5223949	Sengoku Hime 2 is also coming out this week from System Soft, a little strategy game there featuring anime characters, as a lot of the games in Japan end up being.
5225330	5231052	There's also, by the way, a special new keyboard coming out for the Xbox 360 Monster Hunter game, so keep a lookout for that.
5232673	5236495	In other Japanese release dates, there are some games coming out on the PlayStation 3 as well.
5236795	5238876	There's a game called White Album.
5239416	5244379	Suzurariyu Fuyu no Omoide is coming out, and this is an adventure game.
5245239	5250402	Basically, your idol is your girlfriend, and the more popular she becomes, the less time she has for you.
5251542	5252222	Tottorino Atelier
5269327	5285126	Arland No Rekonjushushi 2 it comes out this is a sequel to Rorona No Etler it takes place 10 years after that it's an RPG you have you know synthesis and go on swashbuckling adventures etc etc it's a JRPG at its finest
5286247	5292392	Going over to the Nintendo Wii, SD Gundam Gashapon Wars comes out this week.
5292633	5293974	Oh, I love SD Gundam.
5293994	5294795	They're so cute.
5294835	5298017	There's also a version coming out with a classic controller, it should be stated.
5298258	5298998	So check that out.
5299058	5302181	By the way, Goldeneye, I played completely on a classic controller.
5302221	5303362	That's how they were demoing it.
5303703	5305044	I meant to get that out at some point.
5306565	5308707	You don't have to use motion control at all in Goldeneye.
5308747	5309728	The way it should be.
5310769	5332272	on the Nintendo DS this week in Japan Love Plus comes out this week and there's like all these little play stands and things coming out to support it but that's what it's called it's called Love Plus it's like a experience school and you go on vacations and mountain climbing with three girls and you date it's another dating sim okay guys
5334689	5339332	It's basically a sequel to the one where the guy married the character.
5340072	5340572	Yes, it is.
5340753	5341553	It is that same series.
5341933	5346376	Also, if that's not enough for you, Tokimeki Memorial Girl's Side, third story.
5346436	5350598	So if Love Plus is not for you, maybe you want to play the Girl's Side.
5350618	5352619	You know what the Girl's Side ones are, right?
5353199	5357462	It's basically where you are now the female lead and you're trying to get a boyfriend before graduation.
5358282	5360283	So I like that, that they're both coming out the same week.
5360663	5364865	You know, Rob, I have a Laserdisc of Tokimeki Memorial OEV.
5365205	5365465	Really?
5365905	5368767	Yeah, and I bought it because it had a big Konami logo on it.
5370147	5370387	Fun.
5371368	5374509	That really pretty much does it for release dates.
5374529	5376030	I'm looking at the Sony PSP.
5376710	5381332	I guess I should say Hatsune Miku Project Diva is coming out this week.
5381372	5383033	I think this has been covered on a previous show.
5383113	5383973	It is a rhythm game.
5384093	5388754	There's a number of people in the chat room who have been all kinds of hyper about getting it too.
5388894	5390074	It's the Vocaloid.
5390535	5394375	It's the Sega Rhythm Game, so I bet there's some people... Oh, you know what it is?
5394415	5394756	I'm sorry.
5395416	5396316	It's a price reduction.
5396356	5397936	It's not the initial release.
5398476	5400417	But you know who Hatsune Miku is?
5400757	5401357	The Vocaloid.
5402798	5407139	Remember sending you all those videos of the electronic girl voice singing?
5407279	5407919	Yeah, I do.
5407959	5408479	That's her.
5409279	5413624	Chaos Head Noah is the last game I'm going to mention this week, also on the PSP.
5413704	5416767	That's an adventure game that's coming out there on the PSP in Japan.
5417387	5419029	Alright, DarkSakura, how about the Old Kingdom?
5420777	5422798	Well, um, eh.
5424119	5425020	That's my official answer.
5425620	5427402	No, um, we've got a number of things.
5427502	5431945	On the 23rd, we have Land Bandit and Puzzle Quest 2.
5433846	5434326	Excuse me.
5434927	5444133	And on the 25th, we have Armada 2526, Backbreaker, Demon's Souls, Lego Harry Potter Years 1 through 4, Naughty Bear.
5444673	5447335	That just sounds like a bedroom nickname.
5447495	5448096	Someone's been a Naughty Bear.
5448116	5448956	Oh, my Naughty Bear.
5450277	5456842	Singularity, Transformers War for Cybertron, and that is it for this week.
5458163	5458483	All right.
5459104	5461085	That's going to do it for release dates for right now.
5462967	5463327	What's that?
5463467	5464268	Are you a naughty bear?
5464853	5465774	I'm a very naughty bear.
5466915	5471680	YYR in our chatroom, I love this, talking about Love Plus, although Alpha Cananigram is saying it's Love Plus Plus.
5471720	5473062	Hey, I just read it like it was written, okay?
5473582	5476926	YYR says, I'll be waiting for the depressing sequel, Love Minus.
5477326	5480069	It takes place after all the girls dump the main character's sorry ass.
5480509	5482191	There you go, that's the real game right there.
5482611	5484954	Chat.OrangeSoundsRadio.com if you want to join in the fun.
5486949	5488210	It's such a weird game.
5490091	5491512	At least you don't poke witches in it.
5493434	5495435	So E3, of course, was pretty big.
5496015	5500439	And there was 45,600 attendees.
5501219	5505642	And next year, you can expect E3 to be coming out slightly earlier.
5506143	5509585	June 7th through the 9th, it will be also at the LA Convention Center.
5509925	5513608	And of course, they're expecting probably an even bigger turnout for that as well.
5516799	5535875	alrighty 300 exhibitors this year as well you know what though the show's starting to get a little big like I that was oddly worded the way I said but I mean I don't want it to get as big as it was in 2006 especially when Kensha Hall is now a parking lot which is what they use Kensha Hall for now by the way just so you know it's a parking lot?
5535895	5538597	yes it's a parking lot people park their cars in there in the hall?
5538777	5540138	in the hall when did that get dirty?
5541399	5544322	I think the floor is probably removable they can do that now
5547036	5574615	I'm not kidding when I went down there to use the bathroom at one point I looked in the doors there's all these cars parked in there I don't know if it was the exhibitors or what but that's what they use Kensho Hall for now weird well you know what this is a good story for us to kind of sort of end on here on this part A and that is that you know the news doesn't stop just because E3 is over and apparently Hideo Kojima is and they were saying he was at E3 this week showing off Metal Gear Solid Rising but at the press conference
5574875	5581659	Yeah, apparently he is sitting on a massive PS3 exclusive that was not ready to show at E3.
5582119	5584380	They're going to show it at Tokyo Game Show.
5584900	5587221	So don't forget, the news does not end at E3.
5587241	5590223	There are still other expos that people are going to show their big news.
5591003	5600489	This is coming from a CVG computer and video game source that apparently there is a PlayStation 3 exclusive that is supposed to, quote, own the show in Tokyo.
5600809	5605311	They really wanted to have it ready for E3, but it unfortunately just was not ready.
5605692	5608833	And maybe they didn't want to steal the thunder from Metal Gear Solid Rising anyway.
5609314	5610314	No idea what it could be.
5611075	5614416	Could it be an existing Kojima series like Bokutai?
5614516	5615057	Probably not.
5615117	5615757	Zone of the Enders?
5615957	5616938	I somehow doubt that too.
5618039	5620601	Yeah, I think this is probably going to be a whole new thing.
5621522	5623363	Or maybe another just Metal Gear Solid game.
5623783	5624724	Nah, probably not that.
5625285	5626566	I think it'll be an all new Kojima game.
5628107	5629528	Metal Gear Solid Move Party.
5632751	5633511	Snake Party.
5633792	5634652	Oh wait, that sounds bad.
5635693	5641658	Alright, well we can't end Part A here at Orange Lounge Radio without doing a segment we love here at Orange Lounge Radio.
5642319	5643500	The classic game of the week.
5644471	5645512	Yes, this is a game that I love.
5667577	5667757	Sylphia
5679950	5680611	Sylphia.
5681271	5688897	Yeah, and I had to go to different sources to find more information about it because I haven't played the game for a little while myself.
5689598	5691479	But it's a fun, fun little shooter.
5691579	5694561	It's a 2D shooter set in mythological Greece.
5695882	5700226	You have a ton of extra lives and you get a special attack called the Giga Fairy Beam.
5702247	5702848	Fairy Beam?
5703028	5704629	Yes, because you play as a fairy.
5706170	5706751	You're a fairy.
5708462	5716886	It's not really one of the greatest games because it's really not super challenging, but it's just really, really nice.
5719627	5735015	You start off with this woman warrior who dies protecting Athena's temple, and so she turns into a Sylphia.
5735035	5736176	Yeah.
5736836	5748800	So, um, she can go and, uh, you know, basically stop all the people who, uh, who, uh, you know, tried to hurt all of them.
5749000	5750440	So, that's sort of the main story.
5750800	5760363	Anyway, you fly around and you get power-ups, and, um, your power-ups are bee icons, and, um, you have, like,
5762813	5763894	Thank you for watching!
5778636	5784819	But it really goes for things from pretty much Greek mythology.
5785300	5788421	You have a flying chariot that's pulled by manticores.
5789842	5794024	It's pretty fun, pretty flight of fancy sort of game.
5794964	5798766	And it is put out by Compile, and Compile has brought out a lot of good games.
5798946	5800927	And there's your reason right there to play it, honestly.
5801608	5803989	It's the people who did the Guardian Legend, need I say more.
5804369	5805851	Yeah.
5806572	5810937	But it's pricey to try to find a copy of it now.
5811617	5812318	It really is.
5813239	5816543	I have a copy.
5816663	5818345	It goes for about $100 average on eBay.
5819795	5820415	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5840307	5840527	Yeah.
5840747	5841228	Look at that.
5841468	5842629	Some type of golem, I think.
5842649	5843350	Skimpy little bra.
5844511	5844971	Perverts.
5845292	5846953	But too bad about that Medusa head.
5847654	5847974	Yeah.
5848975	5849676	Alright, there it is.
5850316	5856262	And that's the one thing I also wanted to point out too, is that your attack can go directional based on proximity.
5857423	5858203	Very cool.
5859244	5863128	So it makes fighting the bosses a little bit more dynamic than your average 2D shooter.
5864332	5871294	Your classic game of the week for the PC Engine, a compile classic, Sylphia is the classic game of the week.
5871334	5876676	A game so crazy rare, DarkSakura had to really scour the web to find more information on it.
5877736	5879737	All right, that's going to do it for your classic video game of the week.
5880097	5881978	We have plenty more to come here at Orange Lounge Radio.
5910074	5912775	And welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.
5912815	5924660	We are live with our 371st episode on this June the 20th of 2010 where we are taping live, of course, as we do every Sunday night at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.
5925060	5931563	Speaking of All Games, amongst all the E3 madness, I nearly neglected to mention this and I definitely wanted to mention this at some point tonight.
5932484	5940171	But this has been kind of building for a couple weeks here, and that is the Big Battle, which is a competition between several of the shows on the All Games Network.
5940952	5945516	It is not the hosts, it's the listeners that actually are going to be doing some of the competing in these games.
5946577	5948559	And there's still more games to be announced.
5949140	5953824	Think of it as like a gaming Olympics, and you can get all the information at thebigbattle.net.
5954625	5955346	Thank you for watching!
5969947	5970607	on there right now.
5970667	5975349	And I don't think we can really rest until we're the largest team being represented in the big battle.
5975709	5977730	But then we actually have to win some of the competitions too.
5978130	5983932	And really wrapping up soon, Battlefield Bad Company 2 and Soldner X2.
5984492	5986493	Both of those battles wrapping up very soon.
5986513	5989754	I believe there's going to be a live Battlefield competition on the 26th.
5990574	5994455	And then Soldner X2 is basically get the highest score you can in the next week.
5995456	5999137	But I will say some new competitions were added because we got a lot of Twitter feedback
5999857	6002960	When we first announced the big battle, like, well, where are the games that I own?
6003000	6003800	I don't own those games.
6004120	6005742	Well, remember, guys, it's like the Olympics.
6005762	6008544	There's going to be more and more games that are added as this event goes on.
6009004	6011566	And some of the new games that were added, Pinball.
6011646	6014168	That's right, Zen Pinball and Pinball FX.
6014608	6021053	So you can play the Earth Defense Force Table for high score in Zen Pinball, or you can play Pinball FX, the Buccaneer Table on the 360.
6022074	6026277	Both those events end on July 9th, and more information is available on thebigbattle.net.
6026297	6027078	And it's just high score.
6027598	6028119	Thank you for watching!
6044429	6045290	So check that out again.
6045390	6053562	One more time, TheBigBattle.net and we'll bring you the results for Soldner X2 and Battlefield Bad Company 2 hopefully for next week's show.
6053602	6060411	Hopefully the folks behind the All Games Radio Big Battle will be able to get those results to me soon.
6061834	6067757	Moving on with show stuff, we're going to do some rapid fire news here in part B and then get to the Twitter topics.
6067817	6071379	So if you still need to get your Twitter topics in, you have just a few more minutes.
6072480	6082265	All right, Loki, why don't you start us off with some of the stuff that may be amiss at E3 amongst all these 3DSs and Valve on PlayStation and all this other stuff that was going on.
6083085	6107299	this is kind of neat Secret of Mana is coming to the iPhone later this year basically going to be a port of the SNES game and they didn't really say when exactly it's going to be ported over but sometime in 2010 so keep on looking out for that one also by the way just because I noticed it's not mentioned here Final Fantasy Tactics is also in that same boat very cool
6108347	6111628	Another game coming to the iPhone is Bit.Trip.Beat.
6112409	6113889	That's going to be coming out as well.
6115790	6120312	No word on exactly when that is, but it is coming out soon.
6121272	6121712	That's kind of cool.
6121732	6127774	They're going to use the tilt controls to move the paddle just like the Wii version.
6130395	6136917	Scott Pilgrim vs. The World is getting an arcade game.
6137637	6142938	It's going to be exclusive on the PlayStation Network for a certain period of time.
6144399	6146359	It will be coming out August 10th.
6146999	6151200	Of course, this game looks absolutely amazing.
6153741	6158002	Really, I don't understand why people before when I was posting that we should do...
6159202	6159603	What was it?
6159843	6171578	Remember we had that list list or whatever for the versus games and I picked a really obscure reference of the guy that did the, you know, king of 9 billion percent or whatever.
6171858	6172198	Yes.
6172439	6172659	Yes.
6172859	6173680	I do remember that.
6173780	6173901	Yes.
6173921	6175102	That was many weeks ago.
6175222	6176584	That's the guy that animated this game.
6176764	6177184	Oh wow, okay.
6177265	6178806	And it looks freaking awesome.
6178886	6179126	Alright.
6179146	6182749	I don't remember the guy's name, but I'm sure the chat room will figure that out.
6183210	6185732	But it looks awesome.
6185932	6190035	Like, I actually think about, I may pick this up on the PlayStation Network.
6190976	6191216	Maybe.
6191877	6198743	If I have the patience, I guess I could wait, but it looks so cool.
6199143	6199964	Who did that?
6200064	6201005	I'm trying to remember now.
6203187	6203267	Uh...
6206494	6206955	I don't remember.
6207295	6209297	I'll look it up and chime in later.
6210078	6211379	And then, let's see here.
6212700	6221869	Last thing, rock band stuff coming out this week because, yes, unlike certain other music game platforms, they actually do have stuff that comes out every single week.
6223090	6224150	Not always good though.
6225671	6228492	This week we will be getting the Miley Cyrus pack.
6229793	6232514	Number one, which means I guess there's going to be more than one later on.
6233274	6241557	Included in that will be a few Miley Cyrus tracks including Seven Things, Can't Be Tamed, Fly on the Wall, See You Again, and Start All Over.
6243938	6248280	Those are each available for $2 or the equivalent in your fictional points.
6249380	6252883	and the whole pack will be available for 680 Microsoft points.
6252903	6263810	I have no idea what that translates to in real world money but I can guarantee it's going to be slightly cheaper than buying them all separate if you're really going to buy them all separate or if you were even going to buy them at all.
6264731	6270054	Those will be available June 22nd.
6270094	6272776	I thought the listeners would appreciate a little taste of Miley Cyrus there.
6272936	6274397	She's more talented than her dad.
6274417	6275858	Because I'm built like that.
6276949	6277150	Really?
6282423	6283584	I have a funny story about this.
6283624	6284524	Can I tell it real quick?
6284725	6284945	Tell.
6285125	6294671	I was admiring the wall of songs that they had at the Harmonix booth, and one of the gals that worked for Harmonix kind of caught me looking at it and said, yeah, it's an impressive list, huh?
6294971	6297493	And I said, you know, it could really use some more Lady Gaga.
6298454	6299755	You know, I was just kind of joking, right?
6300055	6302917	And she said, well, you better stay tuned for next week.
6302997	6304398	She says, there won't be Lady Gaga.
6304418	6307880	I can't tell you who it is yet, but there's definitely a lady coming to XY.
6308080	6309341	She was talking about Miley Cyrus.
6309661	6311983	I kind of want to go back and find her and say that's not what I meant.
6313023	6314144	Or you want to punch her in the face?
6315265	6316286	No, she was nice.
6316306	6325633	I don't want to punch her in the face, but I just want to set her straight that Miley Cyrus is not, not, not the same as Lady Gaga.
6326634	6326874	Thank you.
6330154	6338158	And the person that I was looking for that did the Scott Pilgrim game, Paul Robertson.
6339219	6342881	He's the guy doing the sprites, and that guy can animate like nothing else.
6343281	6344802	It is one sexy-looking game.
6345142	6354427	And if that's not cool enough, apparently there's a chiptune rock band, Anamanaguchi, that's going to be providing the soundtrack for the game.
6354527	6354667	So...
6355507	6356728	Seriously, pick it up.
6357268	6361610	If you have to wait for it to come out on Xbox Live, then fine.
6362870	6365472	By the way, can I read some of the chatroom comments here?
6366152	6368333	Toagak says, fucking shit, Sky, turn it off.
6368673	6371274	TheDr945 says, my achy, breaky ears.
6372054	6375716	Shadowrunner says, Sky, you just blew out my eardrum with that god-awful music.
6375776	6376777	Thanks, JK, lols.
6377477	6377917	There you go.
6379058	6382019	So our chatroom, always appreciative of the antics here at Orange Lounge Radio.
6382745	6409590	chat.orangelandsradio.com if you want to yell at me for playing certain songs on the air going over to some other quick news this might have been the game of the show for Loki had he gone Hello Kitty Seasons is coming to the Wii that's right finally Hello Kitty is getting a Wii game I believe she had a GameCube game but now she's getting a Wii game Hello Kitty Seasons will be on the Wii this holiday I don't really know what it's about I think it's a puzzle game but does anybody really fucking care
6411403	6413711	I know Loki cares, but I'll send him the link so he can read it offline.
6413731	6415096	Hey, I bought Kitty the Cool so you could play it.
6417383	6417885	By the way...
6418971	6429815	If you were thinking of picking one of these up, not Hello Kitty, but a Microsoft racing wheel, you might want to get that now, because Mad Catz is saying that Microsoft will no longer be having them produce this.
6431075	6437917	They really had to kind of carefully say this, but they were saying, you're going to have to check with Microsoft for further information.
6438498	6442199	But it's Mad Catz understanding that Microsoft is exiting the wheel market.
6442579	6445220	That was from Mad Catz's PR manager, and obviously...
6445620	6446320	I can see why.
6446660	6450221	With Natal, Kinect, whatever you want to call it coming out soon.
6450861	6466805	I bought one of those to use with my arcade cabinet actually because I have one of those wireless adapters for the 360 controllers and I love my 360 controller for PC games like I use it with Crysis and I use it with Grand Theft Auto on there.
6467885	6472266	I haven't tried the racing wheel yet with any actual games but
6473146	6476308	I can't wait to use it for like, you know, driving games on MAME.
6492200	6497142	It's Grotius with boobies And it's a sequel to the Grotius boobie game that was on the Japanese 360 No, Otomedia's Gorgeous
6520070	6521011	Gorgeous was the original.
6521351	6523133	Excellence is the sequel.
6523433	6523793	Whatever.
6524253	6525034	Boobs and Gradius.
6525174	6526255	That's what they should just call the game.
6526315	6527056	Boobs and Gradius.
6528417	6529778	Gratuitous Boobius.
6532720	6542968	Our friends, buddy pals at BomaniStyle.com had actually a little interview with Naoki Madea at E3 asking about some of the hard questions about what the hell happened to DDR.
6543668	6544788	and DarkSakura.
6570615	6581243	So some of the other things that had come up was they called out the direct comparison to the Power of Hard Ice series and Loki said, yes, I did some work on that, but my team is no longer a part of Bomani.
6581703	6583844	So Dance Masters is not a Bomani game.
6583884	6585606	That's something important to point out.
6587127	6593191	They also said we have professional dancers and choreographers from all over the world creating routines for Dance Masters.
6593611	6598455	So I'm hoping with that in mind that they are actually doing different styles of dance and
6600498	6625454	and it's not just the Paras stuff that perhaps the Paras stuff was able to be finished first because you know maybe they either have the motion capture data for it or they already have routines down for that kind of stuff I'm hoping I also thought this was interesting and I really hope Naoki means this when he says this he was asked a question by MamadiStyle about given that you've worked on all these different types of games do you think that peripheral based games have a strong future in America?
6625834	6633197	And he says, Okay, at Konami we did Guitar Freaks, Drum Mania, 2DX, DDR, and these games created the atmosphere of playing an instrument or dancing.
6633538	6638640	And then in America, Rock Band, DJ Hero, Guitar Hero made it feel more real while still being a game.
6639320	6645443	We are trying to create an even more real experience while still being the most fun possible, so we would like to be flexible.
6645503	6647644	Here's the part I think you should pay special attention to.
6648184	6648244	Hmm.
6660165	6661146	Which I think is a good idea.
6661406	6663808	I think that's a great idea, so we'll see if it actually pans out.
6663848	6671434	Arguably, the game, you know, DDR, some of the best music in DDR was the music coming from Konami.
6672595	6673235	So it makes sense.
6674236	6676137	Alright, how about some Twitter topics, you guys?
6676177	6680701	Shall we go to Twitter and see what the listeners are showing us on their tweets?
6681301	6687528	By the way, if you want to show us your tweets, all you have to do is follow OLR on Twitter at twitter.com slash OLR.
6688048	6688989	And you can send us our tweets.
6689029	6693274	We always say, hey, you guys have a few minutes to get those topics in for whatever you want to talk about.
6693574	6698879	Keep in mind, I'm not going to read every tweet we get because sometimes you guys link to stories that are going to come up a little later in the show.
6698959	6701102	So it's not because I don't like you, I promise.
6702043	6702683	Uh, let's see.
6703404	6708728	Um, I thought this was an interesting link here from Tigerclaw305 on Twitter sending us this.
6709088	6711150	Sony downplays the 3DS.
6711170	6718456	Because, you know, Sony was trying to show a lot of 3D at their conference, too, and then Nintendo just kind of came out and said, well, you don't need glasses for ours.
6718756	6719017	Haha.
6719557	6720097	So here it is.
6720858	6723340	Sony kind of downplayed this a little bit.
6723380	6724540	Kaz Hirai specifically.
6725001	6726962	He said, Here's the problem, Mr. Hirai.
6726982	6728303	They've got the games to back it up.
6728323	6728603	Whereas,
6749571	6759614	I don't know, I guess I should say some of the games that sound like they're pretty awesome on the Sony 3D experience sound pretty cool, but the move I'm a little less excited about.
6760347	6765789	It's just that they, I mean, when they come up with questions like that, what's he going to say?
6767129	6768730	That's amazing, wish we had thought of that.
6768750	6779413	He's obviously going to try to put something... Microsoft and Nintendo, up until Kinect was announced, was kind of trading these little hearts for each other.
6780554	6787616	They used to kind of compliment each other until Microsoft decided they were not going to have any of this competition anymore and go right after it.
6788418	6798765	DarkTetsuya links us to a story where apparently Reggie has said, you know, maybe young kids should probably not play the 3DS.
6799286	6801807	But he actually means very young children.
6802288	6805130	We recommend that very young children not look at the 3D images.
6805290	6808972	That's because in young children, the muscles for the eyes are not fully formed.
6809452	6814196	This is the same messaging that the industry is putting out with 3D movies, so it is a standard protocol.
6814236	6817578	We have the same type of messaging for the virtual boy as an example.
6818138	6820180	Nintendo made my baby cross-eyed.
6822201	6825283	Seven years or older, according to Reggie Fils-Aimé.
6825583	6828345	Again, I think the disclaimers on this thing are going to be a mile long.
6830166	6834669	Alpha Cananogram is saying, Child of Eden 3DS.
6834889	6835470	Good idea.
6835590	6836110	Am I right?
6836410	6837471	I mean, it would look cool on 3DS.
6837491	6839192	It's from Alpha Cananogram.
6839917	6843439	It'd be a little... That might be too much going on.
6843559	6844800	That might be too much for the eyes.
6844820	6847041	They could do it, but it would be a little tough.
6847582	6854746	I think something that's more wireframe, like Rez, would lend itself a little easier to the 3D stuff than maybe Child of Eden.
6855186	6856567	I would like to see a Rez 3D port.
6856767	6864531	You know, something we didn't talk a lot about, but there's... I apologize if I'm mentioning a story that's coming up, but there's hella, hella ports everywhere.
6864611	6866012	being planned for the DS.
6866512	6871255	Like, you know, if you think it was bad, all the stuff that's coming out now, man, they want to go back and do all these games.
6871415	6876978	One of the games I played on the 3DS was the old shooter, old shooter by Namco, Xevious.
6877398	6878379	Dude, that's a great game.
6878539	6879399	And it was 3D.
6880140	6881020	That's fantastic.
6881300	6884062	And there's all these other old school 3D games they're going to go back and do.
6884102	6885743	You probably heard about Ocarina of Time.
6886123	6890025	And I guess there's this list somewhere that details all these games that Nintendo wants to do in 3D.
6890045	6890085	So...
6892108	6894109	Those are actually not games that they want to do.
6894189	6895470	They're in development already.
6895650	6896311	Jeez.
6897111	6897312	What?
6897732	6899653	My brain just did something weird.
6901094	6905237	It combined Ocarina of Time with Weird Al doing the soundtrack.
6905437	6905797	What?
6905897	6907038	The Pokerina of Time.
6909199	6910320	That'd be the greatest thing ever.
6910440	6911321	You are so strange.
6912101	6912902	I had to share that.
6913102	6914303	It just popped into my head.
6914803	6915223	Seriously?
6915584	6916364	Weird Al game?
6916624	6917205	Where is it?
6918266	6919767	There has not been a Weird Al game.
6920447	6921848	Gallagher had a video game.
6923072	6927579	That is just blasphemy that there has been no Weird Al video game.
6927980	6932687	And also I want to say I am also very disappointed with TV being the way it is nowadays.
6933208	6936353	We should really seriously have our own UHF channel by now.
6939172	6942174	Ray Ayanami... Oops, sorry, that was a retweet, not a question.
6942714	6946457	Richard Zard says, I'm very upset I cannot meet up with you at E3.
6946858	6948859	I tried to meet up with you at E3, but that didn't go so well.
6948899	6951361	I was really looking forward to meeting you after three years of listening.
6952102	6960628	Well, unfortunately, E3 is probably the worst possible place to do a meetup because there's so much going on at E3.
6961629	6965932	Unfortunately, it doesn't lend itself as well to meetups as things like PAX and so forth.
6966032	6966713	We were just...
6967213	6968394	There's just too much going on.
6969035	6973599	But honestly, I didn't know there was an interest beforehand for folks to kind of want to meet up.
6974600	6977122	I didn't think enough of our listeners really went to the show.
6977522	6983147	But now that I know there are some, I guess next year, maybe we'll plan like a dinner one night or something we could probably do.
6983427	6988332	But just on the show floor is just really like the worst possible place to have, you know,
6989153	6990634	OLR Reunions, and so forth.
6991935	7001005	STO100Matt is asking us, out of all the E3s you guys slash gal have gone to, which is your fave, worst, and where does this one stack up to those?
7004508	7004829	Easy.
7005389	7008633	My favorite was my first one because you never forget your first.
7009431	7009831	Carameldansen
7031524	7033186	My least favorite year was 2006.
7033366	7036048	The year right before the break.
7036968	7039410	Because that was the year where Paris Hilton had a line going around.
7039430	7041171	There was just too damn many people at E3.
7042152	7043753	And it kind of became a little bit of a joke.
7044714	7047275	And then this year would be my second favorite E3.
7047516	7052179	I felt that I just... I got to do so much this year that I hadn't done in years past.
7052219	7057683	And I was keeping myself so busy with stuff that I was very pleased with the show this year.
7057703	7059384	And I think there was just a lot of good tech to see.
7059804	7062045	Because I don't think last year's show was very good either.
7062125	7064907	That would probably be my second least favorite show next to the 06 show.
7065787	7066648	So I would rank them 04, 10, 05, 09, 06.
7068689	7074312	Well, I can't really rank any of mine.
7074452	7077253	I mean, there's good experiences and bad experiences.
7078294	7080555	And not all of them I link with the convention itself.
7081596	7083897	So I would say...
7086966	7093448	I think that I really did like 2006 just because I got in a ton of awesome interviews that year.
7094588	7099310	And the year before that was pretty cool too because I piggybacked on my friend's press pass.
7100710	7102551	And the year before that was great because it was my first E3.
7104171	7104932	and I got in.
7105152	7112661	I'd actually have to say though that my favorite experience of all the E3s was meeting Koji Kondo and getting it.
7112741	7117647	I found the little book with his autograph and that was just fantastic for me.
7117667	7122713	Of course, Dan, his highlight is, well, the picture that's up there of him meeting Yu Suzuki.
7123954	7141015	I know that other than that though I did have a really massive migraine and having aching feet was kind of suck and Paris Hilton sucked but you know what was actually cool was meeting the Harlem Globetrotters oh cool and they were doing that charity thing so that was pretty cool
7142171	7143953	Takeo Rei sends us a message on Twitter.
7143993	7147056	Have you seen the Penny Arcade comic about the E3 press conferences?
7147136	7148117	Pretty accurate retelling.
7148537	7150759	Oh, God, yes, I did see that, and it was great.
7150879	7151620	I laughed so hard.
7151660	7157645	Somebody actually sent that to me on my phone while I was at E3, and I love the Reggie Fils-Aimé in the middle panel.
7158085	7163270	New Zelda, new Goldeneye, new Kirby, new Metroid, new Kid Icarus, new 3D shit, no glasses.
7163630	7164551	Santa Claus is real.
7164591	7166813	He's in our booth, and he's giving out fucking hand jogs.
7167094	7168395	Nintendo bitches, we out.
7169597	7172422	That's a great retelling of what actually happened.
7173183	7174625	That's going to do it for Twitter topics tonight.
7174666	7176569	Twitter.com slash OLR.
7176609	7178212	Thank you guys who submitted topics tonight.
7178933	7180255	How about some more news?
7180396	7181498	Loki, what you got for us?
7182597	7183037	All right.
7183558	7184338	Well, let's see.
7184418	7187161	There's some stuff I kind of talked about a little bit earlier.
7187741	7196448	Ubisoft, they had a lot of things that were announced during their press conference that kind of had people scratching their head because they weren't really video games, perhaps.
7196528	7198730	I mean, they were sort of...
7199530	7200451	and DarkSakura.
7221874	7223715	They're going to be having a beta coming out for that.
7223795	7227717	You can test it out on this fourth quarter of this year.
7228497	7234720	Shootmania, which is going to be the new kind of first person shooter type of game that you'll be able to create custom levels for.
7235100	7238182	They're going to have a beta for that sometime the first quarter of 2011.
7238502	7242924	And finally, Questmania, which is going to be kind of like their RPG maker type of game.
7243384	7245465	That will be available for beta at some point.
7245665	7246526	They haven't really said when.
7247046	7247386	DarkSakura,
7271218	7278041	BattleTag is a game that is basically laser tag.
7278081	7286504	You've got a vest and these pistols that you run around with and these different targets that you can use for checkpoints or whatever.
7286524	7287885	You can create your own games out of it.
7289505	7294906	and it ties in with your PC which is kind of the scorekeeper, kind of like the game master for the stuff.
7295426	7296547	And so they announced that.
7297127	7297987	It's kind of neat.
7298467	7301768	It's something you would probably see at like Kensha Hall if there was a Kensha Hall anymore.
7303448	7306129	But that's something else coming out later this year on PC.
7306609	7313210	Not really like a game per se that you can't like just play like a first person shooter game with it on your PC.
7313590	7317371	It's actually just something that uses your PC for like scoring which is interesting.
7317691	7325137	and then the game that was pretty much the Wii Vitality Sensor but not, Energy.
7325838	7336827	And apparently Energy was a game that had a sensor that you would put on your finger or penis because you know that's going to happen and you would use this to kind of relax.
7336867	7339309	They had a breathing exercise that you could do.
7340249	7343292	They made Joel McHale do that because he was hosting the whole event.
7344092	7347154	and, um, it's interesting, I guess.
7347394	7347774	I don't know.
7347894	7349254	It's supposed to make you feel good.
7350775	7351916	Make you feel real good.
7351936	7355017	Which I guess putting your penis in the sensor might do that.
7355117	7355477	I don't know.
7355977	7357618	And that's why Santa Claus is at E3.
7357798	7358498	I did post that.
7358558	7360639	I'm like, well, energy, what are they thinking?
7360959	7361900	Time to penis is what?
7363254	7366496	Vatra Shattered Memories, Silent Hill Homecoming
7389172	7416640	also missing from this Silent Hill and this is huge Akira Yamaoka is not going to be a part of the new Silent Hill game so this means the new replacement will be Daniel Licht he does the theme song for Dexter the TV show and he also has done Hellraiser and Children of the Corn so I guess that's kind of cool sadly it's going to be not the same without Akira Yamaoka but at the same time I'm looking forward to seeing what Silent Hill and New People's Hands is going to be
7417541	7432834	by the way the story if you haven't seen the trailer yet it's about a prison inmate in the transport vehicle basically overturned or something and now he's in the fog of Silent Hill which I noticed looked a lot like the movie so I guess they're incorporating the movie into the canon or something I don't know so
7433454	7455679	they are talking about evolving the combat in a different direction as opposed to doing one or the other from the previous games so I don't know DarkSakura I know you're a big Silent Hill fan are you are you hopeful about the new Silent Hill game are you kind of like oh too much has changed this isn't gonna be Silent Hill anymore I'd really have to see I'm gonna reserve judgment
7456360	7456900	Fallout New Vegas Trailer
7476480	7481888	Everything at Bethesda was appointment only, and I didn't see that trailer online, no, because I haven't even played Fallout 3.
7482029	7485414	Well, the trailer was online, and it was great.
7485594	7485814	Cool.
7486215	7487116	Yeah.
7487256	7488438	It was pretty funny, actually.
7489520	7491323	Bobby was telling me it was very neon in there.
7492512	7503961	Yeah, well, Fallout Online is actually starting to solicit for betas, for their open beta.
7504882	7515411	So, if you go to the Fallout Online website, you should, actually I filled out the little form, it's just like a little form, you sign up for their mailing list and they'll send you information on the beta.
7516151	7516552	Eventually.
7519474	7529322	But Interplay had some legal issues for a while, but now it finally seems like it's going forward, so let's hope so.
7529882	7533665	I could deal with some post-apocalyptic killing of people.
7535939	7536760	Too many MMOs.
7537840	7538281	So many.
7538581	7540002	I'm still stuck on Star Trek Online.
7540062	7540863	Nothing's going to get me off of that.
7540903	7541963	I know you are.
7542123	7544265	But it doesn't mean I cannot flirt a little bit.
7544745	7547047	I'm not in a serious, committed relationship.
7547848	7550009	I have an open relationship with Star Trek Online.
7551971	7553432	You can look, but you just can't touch.
7553972	7555153	I can touch all I want to.
7556994	7557615	I'm trusted.
7558635	7559516	I'll always come back.
7562668	7566609	Alright, let's go to one more news story and then we got the mailbag coming at you.
7566689	7575271	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com One of the things that was shown off during the Konami press conference is of course Def Jam Rapstar.
7575691	7580312	What's kind of interesting though is they're going to have this whole online aspect.
7580332	7591074	A lot of community features, different taunts and stuff like you can do rap battles or whatever and actually record different things and
7591594	7592937	Have a community.
7593177	7598366	I guess there's going to be Def Jam talent scouts and stuff like that.
7599328	7603014	Keeping an eye on the good rap star players and whatnot.
7606310	7627527	I don't know, it's a lot of community stuff, which is really cool You know what's interesting is that Def Jam Rapstar actually looks like a really solid game It's a bummer that I'm not as interested in the content there, you know, I can't rap, please But it actually, you know, just kind of looking at it and watching other people playing it and then hearing about all this community stuff I was kind of like, why can't some of the other music games...
7628087	7629168	Take a page from this.
7629308	7633691	Konami, seriously, you have this framework built for Rapstar.
7634511	7638894	Just now make it into a singing game and call it Karaoke Revolution.
7640075	7645278	Or you put this next to the Glee game that they were also showing off and the Glee game looks pathetic.
7645958	7646599	Absolutely pathetic.
7646619	7655865	The Glee game is just a simple try to grab at the market for the Glee stuff because those damn Glee albums are at the top of the charts.
7657698	7660020	Great, we have people covering songs and it's popular now.
7661841	7662221	I don't know.
7664462	7665143	It's interesting.
7665403	7673028	But if they actually put out a solid music game and supported it with enough download content and had all the community stuff, I think it would do really well.
7675279	7683923	I agree, because yeah, the Def Jam game actually, it actually, I gotta say this, I actually kind of wanted to play it, you know, in the privacy of my own home when nobody's watching.
7684083	7686104	I kind of want Irene to play it.
7688585	7689505	She would be a lot of fun.
7689766	7691046	You know, my birthday is coming up.
7691486	7696208	Maybe I should ask the birthday fairy for some Irene playing Def Jam Rapstar.
7696469	7699010	She could get discovered by a Def Jam scout talent.
7699690	7704032	You know, they had some Rapstars actually there at E3 doing the rapping.
7705097	7705878	Lucha Libre AAA
7724435	7734222	They didn't just have the game at Konami's booth, but then I guess the developers or somebody else had a whole huge area right behind it where they were doing the whole who's going to be on the box for the game.
7734383	7734783	That's awesome.
7734823	7737365	And just all these wrestling matches going on all day.
7737765	7745731	I guess I was glad it kind of drew people in and kept them away from other stuff, but I was just like, dang, there was a heck of people over there.
7745751	7750214	I didn't realize wrestling was so popular.
7750234	7750915	Yeah.
7751515	7753035	Anyhow, let's go to the mailbag.
7753376	7763298	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Every week we dive in the mailbag and read emails for you guys.
7763318	7769600	I'm going to take over this week since DarkSakura is still a little bit rough over there with her voice.
7769780	7770980	So hopefully she'll be better soon.
7772580	7774101	Although I should say there's not a lot to read.
7774121	7778522	I'm very disappointed in the listenership that during E3 week there's only two emails.
7779682	7780683	that you guys want us to read.
7781063	7783264	I'm hoping we get more this week after the wrap-up show.
7783304	7784324	Please send us some emails.
7784364	7788807	Mailbag at orangeandre.com I especially want to hear from people who have never emailed us before.
7789147	7790387	Because sometimes we get these emails.
7790407	7792308	I've been listening for two years and I've never emailed you guys.
7792348	7792788	Why not?
7794229	7795290	We want to hear from you guys.
7795310	7796350	What do you guys think of E3?
7796430	7797451	Come on.
7797511	7800512	We won't make fun of your spelling and grammar too much.
7801032	7801533	We promise.
7803394	7811440	First email from Robert M. Do you think the announcement of Portal 2 and Steamworks for the PS3 is related to the introduction of Steam on the Mac?
7813521	7814482	Yes and no.
7814602	7817484	I don't think they're necessarily directly related.
7817644	7821908	I think it's more of a, you know, hey, yay, Valve and PS3 are playing nicely.
7822588	7827612	But I think definitely it is a huge card in Steam's pocket that it's multi-platform.
7828801	7830221	I'm going to go off in a different direction though.
7830261	7838463	Speaking of gaming on the Mac and so forth, one thing we haven't talked much about, that OnLive was there at E3 and they had a pretty big presence.
7839063	7842404	And from the demos they were showing, it looked pretty good.
7842864	7845764	The games were playing pretty well over those little console boxes.
7846104	7849885	And apparently the system is out now on the PC and the Mac.
7849945	7854806	And apparently, I'm even seeing the feedback on Twitter and so forth, it actually runs pretty well.
7855888	7857089	Well, I'll be damned.
7857169	7858330	I know, I'll be damned, huh?
7858411	7858831	Who knew?
7859652	7859972	Who knew?
7860353	7867500	But as far as Steam goes, you know, I think certainly Steam is trying to expand all these different places because it definitely looks good for them.
7868300	7872164	I don't know why I went on the tangent of online, but I guess just the whole like new stuff on the Mac.
7872565	7875207	Mac gamers, what a niche audience.
7875267	7875728	No, I'm just kidding.
7876028	7878050	Mac gamers have had a lot to celebrate this year.
7878070	7878751	I'll tell you that much.
7879271	7879772	That's for sure.
7882480	7889944	Going to this other email from Brian S., who didn't have a fancy little nickname, but we'll say Brian S. Hey, OLR gang.
7889984	7893385	While reading the news on the PS Move and the MS Connect, I started wondering.
7893725	7899508	These two items are really just expensive peripherals for a console, but have any console peripherals really been successful?
7900088	7904390	Sure, during the NES era, I loved Power Glove and Play Track and Field on the Power Pad.
7904730	7908172	But just like ROB, they never have more than one or two games for them.
7908692	7911894	Ignoring peripherals that are specifically made for a game, i.e.
7911974	7925300	music and dance genre games, most peripherals like the Super Scope, Sega CD, 32X, PS2 Hard Drive, iToy, and probably quite a few others I can't remember, seem to lack support and third-party game development initial launch titles.
7925681	7929583	Do you think the same could happen to Kinect slash Move if initial game sales are low?
7931153	7956674	um no I say well I say yes as far as at least the move is concerned um I think though it's it's tricky because you say well you can count these games but you can't count these well-selling games I mean I realize that the music and dance things are a little more niche but if you look at connect as like really opening up the exercise exercise gaming thing then it's a little niche too well let's look at the Wii Fit balance board they use that in a lot of games
7958484	7961466	I mean, it's an add-on thing, but they use that.
7961987	7964308	Wii Motion Plus, it's being used in a lot of things.
7964989	7970633	And iToy was used a lot more than I think you might be giving it credit for, especially in games for the younger audience.
7971893	7979759	I mean, those aren't really specialized peripherals or anything, but if you think about it, a lot of the stuff that they put out that's specialized peripherals, I mean, it's specialized for a reason.
7979799	7981020	It's only going to be used for a few things.
7981620	7996588	I mean, I understand what you're talking about, like the whole eye toy and the PlayStation eye camera or the Xbox 360 motion camera, which was a big waste of money, and I need to turn that in for some, like, store credit somewhere, because, man.
7996848	7997969	Oh, what a waste that turned out being.
7998009	7998609	Yeah, exactly.
7999269	7999510	So...
8001451	8002652	Yeah, I mean, I understand that.
8005213	8007575	Expectations, I guess, for that were a little bit greater than they were now.
8007595	8020503	Because I think with the PlayStation, well, even with the motion camera on the Xbox 360, I think they were thinking it's going to be doing these kind of Kinect things, but it just doesn't have the technology to really support that.
8022357	8031401	YYR in our chats is saying yes, absolutely yes to this question of will the same fate be met if initial game sales are low.
8031741	8034903	He's saying this is why Kinect should be $99 and not a penny more.
8035383	8043967	I agree that if they don't have a really awesome game pack in with this game or with Kinect, the $150 is unfortunately past the sweet spot.
8045917	8062994	a lot of people are going to be in for an unpleasant shock too that if Kinect is $150 and it's sitting right next to a Wii that's also $150 there's going to be people out there that don't realize you need an Xbox 360 to actually use Kinect and it's going to be depressing for some people
8064260	8064740	Thanks for watching!
8093514	8101398	DarkSakura and Sky, I hope you're both feeling better.
8101618	8103039	If not, I hope you get well soon.
8103279	8103719	Aw, thank you.
8103879	8105320	I'm doing much better than I was the nightly show.
8105400	8109422	I am better, it's just that my throat was really damaged and it hasn't fully healed yet.
8110416	8112897	and that's from Brian S again and also one more thing.
8112957	8113377	P.S.
8113737	8117679	Part of the reason I wrote this email was to have a reason to write I love to power glove.
8118059	8118680	It's so bad.
8119860	8120340	There you go.
8120420	8121561	That's your emails for this week.
8121621	8127883	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Please fill up our mailbag and so that way when DarkSakura's voice is all better she has some work to do.
8128744	8130805	We like giving DarkSakura lots of work to do, don't we?
8131665	8137247	Alright, some more gaming news for you guys and then we're going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR but don't call yet.
8137287	8137968	It ain't open yet.
8138428	8138748	Loki.
8140101	8166163	one of the last things that they showed off during the Ubisoft press conference and they didn't really show anything they just kind of hinted at that it's coming the Michael Jackson game the one that was rumored to be in development is now being developed by Ubisoft and no word exactly on what it is but it's something that's possibly going to be some singing dancing game that does support the Kinect I think it's very sad that it's not Sega
8167301	8167921	PSP, Wii, and DS
8187586	8191969	Anywhere they can milk that guy for more money in the afterlife, they will.
8192369	8192790	In other words.
8193891	8194051	Yeah.
8194331	8194711	Am I right?
8195532	8195892	You're right.
8197133	8200395	Hey, this is pretty cool because I remember these games.
8200415	8201136	They were a lot of fun.
8201516	8203717	Apparently, Burger King is going to be coming back to the 360.
8203757	8205379	That's right.
8205719	8209241	The Burger King guy is coming back, and this time it has to do with Kinect Games.
8209261	8209982	Buying all of them.
8210482	8211383	Every single one.
8211543	8213164	I don't care how terrible they are.
8213304	8214425	I am buying all of them.
8214585	8218828	No news on the details, no news on the style, no news on the number of games.
8219429	8232139	All that's being said so far is from Burger King Chief Marketing Officer Mike Capit saying, Our first endeavor with Xbox 360 took the gaming world by storm, so we couldn't pass up the chance to come together on another cutting edge program.
8232479	8240646	During this year's promotion, our guests can look forward to an even greater adventure that will stimulate the imaginations of gamers and entertainment lovers of all shapes and sizes.
8240666	8240926	They were so...
8241346	8243467	Like, Sneak King was so creepy.
8243527	8244467	You don't understand.
8244527	8247588	You cannot get more creepier than that game.
8247928	8249468	It is absolutely worth the money.
8250729	8251949	I don't care how terrible they are.
8252249	8254510	Because terrible games can sometimes be good games.
8255250	8257811	Like, for example, Driver 3.
8258191	8258851	Terrible game.
8258911	8260911	Let's not forget, the games were $5.
8262692	8260911	$4.
8263472	8264372	$3.99.
8263952	8264372	My bad.
8264392	8264372	$4.
8264512	8266873	It was an amazing deal.
8267133	8268654	Hopefully they're just as expensive this year.
8269274	8269814	That'd be great.
8273722	8275624	That should be the packing right there.
8275964	8276404	There you go.
8276464	8278406	There's your reason to plunk $150 on Kinect.
8280288	8281389	There you go, skeptics.
8283071	8285333	Sneak King 2 featuring Kinect.
8285694	8287135	I think it's going to be pretty awesome.
8288216	8290198	I have high hopes for the Kinect.
8291219	8293762	Don't screw me again, damn camera games.
8295365	8309893	I learned my lesson with I actually bought the camera for every single damn system they've all failed me so far except I did not buy the camera that was on the Wii because I don't like exercise games but whatever anyways so yeah
8310453	8314096	There's some more features being announced for LittleBigPlanet 2.
8314257	8316819	Lots of cool stuff that they're showing in the whole community features.
8318801	8322985	One aspect they're saying that, of course, getting revamped is all the stuff that they had.
8323665	8327128	It's going to be easier to find players' creations.
8327829	8331533	And, of course, they're going to have a different interface now.
8331633	8334996	No longer will you have to search across planets to find different levels.
8335796	8339078	and you'll be able to actually bring them up in a list.
8339398	8342500	Also different metrics like genres, keywords, etc.
8343320	8347402	And they're also saying that they're going to be
8349133	8349993	www.lilbigplanet.me
8369402	8373965	And in it, of course, you can see the pages in the browsers.
8374646	8381210	The games will be automatically queued up the next time you play your game if you pick different levels on there.
8381651	8389236	Also, you can just, I guess, print out one of the QR barcodes assigned to each level and you pop it in front of your PlayStation Eye.
8390097	8391579	and your creations come up.
8391879	8401854	That'd be kind of cool if you made some games or whatever, put it on your business card, put that little barcode on there and then people can scan your barcode or your business card and your level pops up.
8403096	8407139	Or, Rob, let's think here for a second.
8408100	8410421	Wouldn't it be awesome to get LittleBigPlanet 2?
8410501	8414404	You make business cards with, say, our website on it with that barcode.
8414504	8422769	And when you load that level, it has a bunch of information about our website, the podcast, all that stuff in the level.
8423010	8424691	It's like a playable business card.
8424771	8427032	Or those shirts we've been talking about doing for seven years.
8427072	8428953	You could put the barcode on the shirt.
8429394	8431035	Or maybe we need OLR pants.
8432996	8436737	So that way the barcode is on the butt, and it could be, here, scan my butt.
8438038	8443599	And you could play LittleBigPlanet 2, the Orange Lounge Radio Experience, using your butt.
8445040	8445900	I think that's a great idea.
8446420	8447440	We need to oil our pants.
8447740	8451381	DarkSakura, do they let you make your own pants with logos on the butt?
8452602	8453262	It wouldn't be hard.
8454226	8456207	There's gotta be a way to do it.
8457248	8461030	I mean, who cares about shirts when you can have OLR with a barcode butt?
8461631	8462191	You can do that.
8462391	8467975	You can do, I think, on those cafe press and stuff like that, you can do boxers and stuff.
8470336	8472798	OLR underwear with the barcode on your butt.
8472818	8474499	It wouldn't be too hard to design a transfer.
8476040	8476660	It really wouldn't.
8477261	8478742	That's an even better idea.
8479062	8480303	I wanna play the OLR level.
8480343	8481303	Pull down your pants.
8488735	8490016	Oh, this is just wrong.
8492477	8493998	I'll show you my little big planet.
8498961	8500162	That's what you say on the back.
8500222	8501663	It would say little big planet.
8502023	8503904	And on the front, it would just say big planet.
8508767	8510047	With two moons that orbit it.
8510568	8510928	All right.
8514110	8515190	I'm in a room with children.
8518270	8521855	Tonight's show has been way too serious.
8522276	8523357	E3 is serious business.
8523417	8527823	We needed some barcodes on your ass to break the tension a little bit.
8528243	8531768	SSJ100 Matt asks, will that barcode make it easier to friend your butt?
8532952	8535233	Maybe that's what Nintendo plans to do with Friend Codes.
8535253	8538774	We need to have a repeat of the Seaman video.
8539554	8540494	Maybe after the show.
8540554	8540875	I know.
8541035	8541535	Maybe later.
8541795	8542295	We'll do that.
8542495	8542915	Maybe later.
8543835	8546356	Alright, but we gotta... Serious business, guys.
8546736	8548117	E3 is serious business.
8548517	8550878	What are you laughing at?
8550938	8554199	You mentioned that he's all, fuck clothes, I want an OLR tattoo.
8554499	8559561	I actually saw the other day when I was searching for stuff to do the stencils for the baby's room.
8559901	8560721	They do have
8561221	8566817	things you can get where you can print your own temporary tattoos that could happen
8567819	8569340	An OLR temporary tattoo?
8570441	8570981	Yes.
8571121	8574004	That's about what the giveaways were at E3 this year, by the way.
8574284	8580528	I know people think you walk out of E3 with bags and bags of crap and them giving away 360s at the one press conference.
8580548	8584792	Yeah, it used to be that way, but now in this economy, you're lucky if you get a temporary tattoo.
8584932	8589855	My boss brought me a Tron Evolution t-shirt that has the disc on the back.
8590155	8590316	What?
8590396	8591556	I didn't get that.
8591637	8593398	And also I got a Power Gig t-shirt.
8593598	8594779	I fucking played Tron.
8594799	8595960	I didn't get the Tron shirt.
8597121	8598964	I have a Tron shirt.
8608168	8609689	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8634335	8634575	All right.
8634695	8635977	Oh, and BlackWolf is mad now.
8636037	8637298	He didn't get a Rock Band 3 shirt.
8637338	8637498	Good.
8637518	8637918	We're even.
8638379	8638699	All right.
8641562	8642623	We are officially even.
8643063	8643383	All right.
8643503	8644424	One more story for you guys.
8644444	8647707	Then we're going to take some calls at 877-GAME-OLR.
8648228	8650049	Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8650069	8654273	And that is a new controller coming out for the PlayStation 3 that was being shown at E3.
8654313	8655294	It was from Hori.
8655855	8659458	And they are marketing a PS3 MMO controller.
8659778	8661059	Final Fantasy XIV, DC Universe
8678885	8679465	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8703403	8711169	You know, it kind of reminds me of, remember how they had that keyboard for Phantasy Star, I think, on the GameCube or something like that?
8711329	8711509	Yes.
8712790	8713411	It's like that.
8714772	8717915	But honestly, though, just buy a USB keyboard.
8718115	8719516	You don't need this fancy piece of shit.
8719777	8728906	Toagak wants to know the time to penis for this controller because it does have a little curvature there where it looks like you would grab that little controller thing.
8729326	8736513	I would expect it to be longer than, say, the other We Relax type thing just because it's not obvious to put your penis in there.
8736733	8741457	And it'll probably come out in Japan first, and they're not as disgusting as we are here in America.
8742378	8744259	So I would say it's going to be at least a few days.
8744279	8745040	You think they're not?
8746381	8747642	You think, Rob?
8747662	8748263	I guess that's true.
8748423	8752927	Let me say, it's not as obvious all over the internet.
8752947	8756930	You think, with underwear vending machines, Rob, and moe lap pillows...
8762099	8762619	That's true.
8762639	8764180	This is the country that's ooga booga.
8764661	8768223	This is the country that brought us the Hello Kitty vibrator.
8768243	8768943	Hold on, hold on.
8769063	8774627	Because they're not so repressed by having all of that, there's no need to put your penis on an MMO controller.
8774807	8775187	That's true.
8775207	8776448	Because you have all these other.
8776688	8780511	But here in America where everybody's sheltered, everybody gets freaky deaky behind closed doors.
8780531	8781711	They call it the pecan.
8788576	8788836	All right.
8790524	8790805	What?
8791505	8791966	Eh, whatever.
8792787	8794269	See, see, Bobby agreed.
8794810	8800677	I think I'm on to something, though, with the fact that we don't notice it as much because they're not as repressed as we are over here.
8801058	8801939	Oh, shoot.
8802179	8804222	Yeah, the same country that gave us La Blue Girl.
8805684	8806485	I guess that's true, too.
8807666	8808267	But still, they're not...
8808635	8809796	Tentacle porn, Rob!
8810177	8810617	Tentacle porn.
8810637	8812800	You're not hearing about them putting their dicks in things.
8812880	8815103	It's just that they marry inanimate objects.
8815143	8816364	No, wait, that was in Japan anyway.
8816485	8822011	Actually, I was listening to a podcast just recently called Stuff Mom Never Told You.
8822031	8823273	Uh-oh.
8823433	8825996	It's by the people that did Stuff You Missed in History class.
8827557	8830619	Yeah, those are the podcasts I listen to, hello.
8831219	8845865	But they were talking about how there actually is an epidemic sort of going around now in Japan where men are sort of withdrawing from dating and it's not that, you know, it's just that they're not interested in sex at all.
8846725	8852928	That's why they have, the guy married his lap pillow and the guy married his video game and all of this and...
8853669	8862846	TigerClaw in our chatroom says, don't be surprised when people start taking photos of their 3D penis on the 3DS.
8864815	8865095	Some... Some...
8893474	8900101	Chick or whatever, plain scantily clad, you know, God, whatever, Just Dance, Just Lap Dance, you know.
8900121	8901222	Upskirt Cam 3D.
8902023	8903745	Or, you know, Dance Central.
8904165	8905646	Pole Dance Central, yeah.
8906547	8910191	BlackWolfInChat says, Sky is thinking about Craigslist 3D penis postings.
8911432	8912513	Wave of the future, folks.
8913134	8913835	Wave of the future.
8914175	8916278	I don't want to see that wave of the future.
8916518	8918640	I had to share the image with our chat room.
8919241	8919321	Of?
8919801	8922264	Of the poster for Lovely Girl Live Action.
8922284	8924947	So what you're suggesting is that it's Chatroulette 3D.
8925568	8926088	Oh, God.
8928351	8930253	What do you think is worse on the internet?
8930593	8932095	Craigslist or Chatroulette?
8932555	8933216	Chatroulette.
8935692	8941836	Even though you got robbed of a several hundred dollar machine on Craigslist, you still think Chatroulette is worse?
8942116	8942756	Probably.
8943276	8946718	I've never been on Chatroulette, so I can only imagine, though.
8947219	8947539	Nice.
8950540	8955003	We should do OLR on Chatroulette one night just for fun.
8955023	8957324	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8958525	8958825	What?
8959165	8959826	What's that?
8961186	8962047	You guys are gay.
8962067	8962147	Okay.
8970580	8970920	All right.
8973221	8975302	Let's open up the Skype line.
8975322	8978404	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8978444	8980505	The Skype line is now open for business.
8982125	8984088	Ossifer is saying I should go to Chatroulette right now.
8984208	8985790	No, I'm not going to go to Chatroulette right now.
8986071	8989155	I'm not going to derail the show completely with Chatroulette.
8989556	8994383	Although I would like to see maybe a podcast with some of the video game people just playing on Chatroulette.
8994683	8995204	It would be fun.
8996606	8998128	Although the joke would probably get old real quick.
8999583	9002205	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9002225	9008751	Give us a call if you want to ask us anything about E3 or talk about anything at E3 or maybe there was something on the show floor you didn't get to see enough of.
9009731	9010132	I don't know.
9010372	9012974	Give us a call and we'll have some words.
9013635	9016657	In the meantime, Loki, you got any last minute stories for us?
9016797	9016998	Yes.
9017458	9018999	Let's talk about the Summer of Arcade.
9019959	9031485	Coming out, of course, this summer, they have announced the lineup for Summer of Arcade, including Castlevania Harmony of Despair, Hydro Thunder Hurricane, Lorecraft and the Guardian of Light, Limbo, and Monday Night Combat.
9032065	9035407	If you buy all of those, you will get a refund for 800 Microsoft Points or $10.
9035527	9035927	Ooh, $10!
9038269	9035927	$10!
9038989	9043231	Let's go to the phones.
9043271	9044232	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9044252	9044572	Who's this?
9046416	9047218	Legend of Zaku
9051976	9054857	Just here on my bed with my Mac.
9055698	9056458	Let's see.
9057278	9061340	All that post E3 stuff that you're still trying to digest, I suppose.
9062081	9062681	And you too.
9062701	9067403	I guess the highlight of that event for me was basically seeing the Gran Turismo 5 trailer.
9068143	9070684	Ah, that was completely missed by us here at OLR.
9070744	9071264	That's right.
9071344	9073766	Finally, a freaking date for Gran Turismo 5.
9073826	9075706	I don't just play dancing games.
9076367	9079188	I'm a big sucker for those racing games.
9079688	9108017	racing simulator games if you're a fan of racing games let me tell you this on the 3DS there was a demo on the floor for Ridge Racer it looked great but it played like garbage so I really hope this was just like a concept demo and that the real thing is fixed because when you run into a wall it's like not even realistic your car will turn like 45 degrees when you run into a wall it's crazy I like the PSP Ridge Racer games the
9108718	9111140	I can't imagine it'd be too hard to port that stuff over.
9111661	9117808	But Mario Kart, that concept video looked great, but I know that's not realistic racing, but I just thought I'd throw that in there.
9119110	9123575	I mean, when I actually saw the trailer, I couldn't imagine how detailed
9124039	9127823	How much effort was put into actually making it look almost realistic.
9128483	9130485	Hence the reason for the number of delays.
9130625	9137832	So, at least in this video game generation, Duke Nukem Forever kind of got lost.
9138373	9143858	Whereas, well, in other words, GT5 managed to beat out Duke Nukem Forever and
9144454	9147756	and like Vaporware that never actually became Vaporware.
9147956	9148937	But it's going to happen.
9149217	9149718	It's going to happen.
9149758	9152199	Hey, Duke Nukem at least has the Manhattan game for whatever it's worth.
9152479	9156662	Let me ask you this, Zaku, since you're a racing game fan and you kind of bring up what happened at the press conferences.
9157062	9161786	What did you think of Microsoft showing off Forza with no wheel?
9162166	9165728	Is that interesting to you or are you just kind of like gimmick, gimmick, this is lame?
9166209	9167189	I need a wheel.
9167209	9169891	I need a physical wheel to grab onto.
9170652	9171572	Something tangible.
9171692	9173954	Not some Mickey Mouse pretend wheel.
9175054	9180676	If I want to do that, I could just do that right now by just moving my hands at 10 and 2 in the air.
9181676	9185137	So you're probably pissed about Mad Catz having to discontinue that wheel, huh?
9186997	9190558	No, I want like a Logitech wheel or something.
9191338	9193339	Mad Catz is taking over production of that wheel.
9195279	9196740	Microsoft is continuing it.
9196780	9198200	Mad Catz is taking over production of it.
9198320	9200901	I took it away from the story that it just wasn't happening, period.
9201428	9207312	No, because I thought that they even had a picture of the Mad Catz one that looked exactly like the other one, unless that was Photoshopped, which it could have been.
9208593	9222344	I was going to say what would be kind of cool is with these new camera peripherals and whatever, to have something that incorporates where you actually play the game, say, with a controller, and then you can make a gesture or something like that to...
9223285	9225829	Right, shift up and down, break.
9226310	9234183	But then you need enough space to actually get... You need enough surface area to actually get the actual... You know, the person...
9234926	9239547	to actually get their image in there for the camera to do its logic to detect moves.
9239747	9247369	Or not even necessarily anything that has to do with shifting, but perspective change or something like that so you can do a little bit of head tracking.
9247389	9254090	Head tracking, they already said, Sony already said that it's going to be supported for Gran Turismo 5 via the camera.
9254890	9260072	It's just that I guess head tracking would make sense if you actually had...
9262952	9265894	Like a VR headset, not just through a TV.
9266815	9272579	It wouldn't feel right if I'm just tilting my head one way and I couldn't even see that angle.
9274460	9276342	If it was trying to do that sort of head tracking.
9277262	9278944	Unless I actually saw it in front of me.
9280445	9284187	Alright, well, Zaku, I want to change the topic one more time here before we let you go.
9284207	9288991	Because I know you've been a long-time listener of the show and you know a lot about music games.
9289491	9291833	Surely you have an opinion on Dance Masters.
9292830	9296415	Yeah, you mean that new Konami game for the Kinect, right?
9296756	9297036	Yes.
9297857	9308652	Yeah, I actually read the interview on Bamani Style with Naoki, and he's basically trying to, you know, he's trying to pitch that game, trying to, like, because, you know, I mean...
9309665	9313828	It's going to be a tough battle between what Harmonix is dishing out.
9314348	9327878	Because I think, if anything, Konami's pretty much missed the boat on some of these major events in the past 10 years of where they could have capitalized on the whole rhythm gaming genre in this country.
9329369	9348945	And their failure to do it resulted in the prominence and rise of folks like Activision, Harmonix And they missed the boat on so many occasions I don't really think I can take them seriously But that's not to say that I'm going to shun this game completely
9349625	9357691	I know with the new motion control scheme, it kind of replaces the pads.
9358711	9364535	From that perspective, you don't have to worry about buying a dedicated peripheral just for that game.
9365156	9373721	If the camera can actually see your whole body and accurately detect all the movements...
9374639	9375780	DarkSakura.com
9392554	9393555	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9415552	9425300	Yeah, if Microsoft really, really wanted to impress me, those rooms, the little bubbles that they were showing Kinect in on the show floor, instead of being bright, light rooms, would have looked like actual people's living rooms.
9426021	9429444	But maybe they weren't ready to take that chance.
9429464	9439653	Last year when I actually heard of Project Natal, I didn't realize, I actually didn't take them that seriously just because they were doing something that Nintendo's already done.
9440353	9445837	and Sony to an extent with the PS, with the Itway back in the PlayStation days.
9448259	9457846	And then one year later we see how far, how advanced this camera is and it's pretty much something in its own, that can stand on its own.
9458667	9463551	Because it's not just any old Mickey Mouse camera that tries to detect a 2D image.
9469491	9475794	of that actor, it actually has another dimension to it.
9475994	9487380	So if it's that accurate with that type of detection, that could really push Microsoft far in this whole new genre that they're trying to dish out.
9487720	9488040	All right.
9488301	9494504	Well, Zaku, we've got to let you go to get more calls, but thank you very much for your call, and happy racing or dancing, whatever you choose to do.
9495124	9495404	All right.
9496565	9497005	Take care, buddy.
9498695	9505224	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call and interact with our program here tonight.
9505905	9508368	Meanwhile, I'll ask Loki if there's some other news he wants to touch on.
9509249	9512133	Yeah, we can talk a little bit about how...
9514316	9517798	The, uh, well, different games that they have for the PlayStation Move.
9517838	9522160	They did announce, like, their full list of games that are, um, well, I guess coming soon.
9522500	9526042	First party, they've got Beach Sketchers, which I have no idea what the hell that is.
9526082	9532985	SOCOM 4, Ipet, Kung Fu Rider, which is that one that you ride down the office chairs, but now they added Kung Fu to it, I guess.
9533885	9562925	Sports Champions, Start the Party, Echo Chrome 2, Tumble, Hustle Kings, The Fight Lights Out, The Shoot, TV Superstars, High Velocity Bowling, because they always need bowling, Pain, which is that demo for Pain, Heavy Rain is going to be getting support later on, Sing Star Dance, Little Big Planet 2, The Sly Collection, Heroes on the Move, which looks terrible, Killzone 3, and Sorcery, which looks really terrible.
9563845	9564966	You didn't like the sorcery demo?
9564986	9566247	That looks stupid.
9566267	9567388	Alright, let's go to the phones.
9568529	9569730	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9569770	9570210	Who's this?
9571671	9572532	Hey, it's Sterlok.
9572732	9573953	Hey, Sterlok, what's on your mind?
9575574	9576155	Uh, not much.
9576355	9581859	I was, uh, just wanted to give my thoughts and impressions about E3.
9582319	9583200	Yeah, please do.
9583220	9583620	What'd you think?
9584541	9586622	Um, I was pretty impressed.
9587183	9587283	Um...
9589480	9595745	I'm actually... You probably wouldn't expect me to say this, but I'm actually looking forward to the 3DS.
9596786	9603531	Now, of course, for listeners that may not know why that's a surprise, because they're new to Orange Lounge Radio, why would that be a surprise to people?
9604512	9606713	Because I'm totally blind.
9608094	9618843	The 3D aspect of it is kind of meaningless to me, but the reason I'm looking forward to it is because apparently
9620782	9628750	There's going to be a much higher capacity for data storage.
9629711	9637299	I'm looking forward to how the audio is going to improve especially with the really impressive lineup of games.
9638366	9641007	I'm really looking forward to it.
9641327	9641827	Absolutely.
9641867	9645068	I mean, certainly the games are part of what wins me over as well.
9645128	9647909	You know, as neat as 3D is.
9648029	9656492	Star Fox 64, Ocarina of Time, Paper Mario, Super Street Fighter 4, I'm really looking forward to that.
9657272	9657993	See how they do that.
9658093	9661534	You know what's really sad that they did not have a demo for or even in development?
9662435	9663815	A new F-Zero game with 3D.
9663835	9665996	Yeah, you know what?
9666036	9669138	I'm surprised with everything else that was announced.
9669318	9670218	Maybe in 24 years.
9670359	9676501	I immediately thought of you when that was announced.
9676762	9678362	Funny enough, I think a lot of listeners did.
9678943	9680844	Also,
9684889	9686197	I don't know if you guys got to see it
9688342	9692385	The new Mortal Kombat looks just freaking insane.
9692445	9701550	You know, sadly, there was a huge line just to get in and see it, although apparently it was playable in that little room that they were showing, and unfortunately we didn't get in there.
9701590	9703311	It was just a matter of prioritizing.
9703672	9707874	As much of a fan of Mortal Kombat as I am, there was just other stuff I wanted to see more.
9709936	9713018	It was getting a lot of very positive buzz, though, from the people that saw it.
9713098	9715859	It sounds like the franchise is going back in the right direction, which is good.
9715899	9716500	Thank goodness, yeah.
9717140	9718862	Thank God, it's what it needed.
9724047	9725549	I think that trailer is all you really need to see.
9725569	9729513	With the exception of DC Universe, I was not too impressed with the last few games.
9731455	9739823	Especially with that stupid story mode slash RPG element that was in a lot of them.
9740856	9746721	Yeah, and then they tried to do the puzzle combat, and it just spread itself too thin, I think.
9746741	9750825	Puzzle combat and, what was it, motor combat, where they were trying to be like Mario Kart.
9750905	9755229	Oh, yeah, I remember when the Mortal Kombat game just randomly had the Mario Kart mode in it.
9755289	9756010	Like, what the hell was that?
9756030	9757911	I think that was more for, like, just being funny.
9758292	9760754	I mean, that was the whole point, is like, ha, like, we're funny.
9761334	9763817	Yeah, it still sucked.
9763837	9764217	Yeah.
9767462	9772251	Well, Sterlok, was there anything else out of E3 that really made you excited besides just the 3DS?
9773874	9773975	Um...
9775740	9778021	Not really, I thought the move looked kind of stupid.
9778041	9784943	It seemed like, okay, it's kind of like what you guys thought.
9784983	9787804	It's basically the Wii, but with better graphics.
9788304	9799387	I think when you put these new things side by side, the move and the 3DS, the reason why, you know, Loki just read off the big list of games that are coming to the move, and I'm kind of just going, eh.
9799867	9806851	either I already played it with a controller or I can play it with a controller or I'm just not really interested in dropping the money just to play it with a move.
9809012	9814816	I am kind of looking forward to connect though with seeing how the voice commands work.
9814936	9821720	I'm really curious because voice recognition kind of has this reputation of being a little iffy.
9823381	9825482	So I'm really curious how that's going to
9827900	9831362	Me too, because that's not something they were really showing off at E3 again.
9831382	9833603	I think they might have been a little nervous about that technology.
9833623	9835024	They mentioned it a little bit.
9836605	9841208	And I guess what you do is you just say, you know, Xbox Play or whatever.
9841349	9843370	But yeah, they didn't show it off very extensively.
9843570	9844151	Alright, later.
9844171	9844371	See ya.
9869917	9880286	Quick question from SSJ100Matt Why is it that when Nintendo ports GameCube to the Wii, we poo-poo it, but when the 3DS ports a lot of N64 games, we praise them?
9880847	9881788	That's a good question.
9882108	9882548	I don't.
9882728	9884610	I actually think all the porting makes me nervous.
9885030	9886171	I don't really praise it.
9886252	9889975	In fact, I think Ocarina of Time, once again, overrated damn game.
9890355	9890475	Um...
9891716	9893016	I could care less that it's on there.
9893036	9900478	Star Fox 64 was kind of fun, but yeah, I don't want to see a bunch of old 64 games just being ported over because they can.
9900618	9907160	It's neat to see these things in 3D for the first time, I'll give you that, but is it $30 neat or however much they're going to charge for these games?
9907420	9909661	You know they're going to be more expensive than a regular DS game.
9910841	9913422	This is just going to be an excuse to jack up the price 5-10 bucks.
9913442	9914222	You know that, right?
9914542	9915122	You know that.
9917233	9918394	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9918434	9918874	Who's this?
9920315	9920976	This is DT.
9921516	9922617	Hey, DT.
9922737	9923578	What's on your mind, buddy?
9927220	9929562	You know, watching the E3 coverage all week.
9931263	9933165	How is E3 from the comfort of your living room?
9935550	9936832	Oh, it's still pretty good.
9936852	9938753	Oh, everything Nintendo had is pretty surprising.
9958508	9959209	Oh yeah.
9959229	9960829	All those first party games coming?
9960849	9960969	Mm-hmm.
9986501	9987182	Lots and lots of stuff.
9987202	9988763	What did you think of Connect and Move?
9990464	9991484	I thought that was cool.
9992265	9996648	You know, we pretty much called it as far as the Dance Masters goes.
9997328	10001671	That was the first thing we said was they should have like a Paratype game for...
10003013	10029305	I'm not sure if I said it but I think someone here did and yeah they got it right you guys hit the nail on the head whereas I said yeah right you're never going to get a para para game in the US and here it is but I think we can all agree this is as close as you're ever going to get if Dance Masters is not enough for you have a night of fire in it with the actual para dance from back in the day I don't think there's really going to be anything that's going to make you happy at all
10031550	10042374	You know what's really funny is that was actually one of my future RetroReview articles was going to be about all those motion-controlled dancing games like ParaPara and Dance Maniac and all of that.
10044209	10045870	I was just watching some videos of it randomly Wow
10065402	10065522	Oh, wow.
10091912	10093013	Oh yeah.
10093133	10094275	It's not that hard to set up.
10094875	10098219	Yeah, it's very interesting that that was the most popular thing though.
10098740	10104386	Probably the only other thing that really had a line was maybe either 2DX Sirius or DJ Max Technica.
10105788	10106829	I was like, hold notes?
10107229	10108911	What are these hold notes in my 2DX?
10108951	10110253	You know I have Dance Maniacs.
10110713	10110953	Huh.
10111414	10112315	I have a Dance Maniacs.
10113161	10114162	The actual machine?
10114522	10115503	I have the arcade board.
10116084	10117485	I have a working arcade.
10117625	10118787	I have a System 573 board.
10119007	10119788	It's sitting at my desk.
10119868	10121069	It's a footrest right now.
10121129	10122110	Hook it up, dummy!
10124272	10127796	Let's play.
10128437	10131140	Well, DT, did you have anything else you wanted to share with our listeners today?
10137419	10157613	Alright, thank you so much for all the hard work you do on those articles We really appreciate it at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Lots of good stuff there Alright, thanks so much GT, you have a good week You too Alright, that's our own Dark Tetsuya Who writes articles for OrangeLoungeRadio.com You can rig that up, it wouldn't be that difficult to do I know, and I think you've got a new project now
10158263	10160605	I have to finish the ones I have right now.
10180663	10187287	Yeah, apparently you can use the PlayStation 3 DualShock controller instead of the Moves navigation controller.
10187768	10190449	This navigation controller costs $30 by itself.
10191370	10191750	Seriously, $30.
10193952	10195773	$80 per controller if you add the two together.
10198114	10199075	This is interesting.
10199215	10203017	Bobby Kotick, evil guy that works for Activision.
10204318	10208301	Whose idea it probably was to not have a booth and instead have that party.
10209788	10213851	Call of Duty Online Call of Duty Online
10237688	10250529	in other words he thinks that people that buy Call of Duty are suckers and that they're willing to pay extra money to play online with Call of Duty and to be honest with those $15 map packs that sell like crazy he might be right
10252742	10253562	Which is really sad.
10256403	10259644	Of course, everyone wants to compare console versus console.
10260124	10271747	Well, now Amazon has different interests, of course, that show on their website for pre-orders, whatever, for Kinect and for the Move.
10272447	10273268	And right now...
10275328	10286374	Apparently, Kinect holds the number one spot on their top selling video games list, with the Xbox 360, the new one, right behind it.
10286734	10294339	And the first mention of the PlayStation Move is the navigation controller, which is at number 44, and the Move starter bundle at number 46.
10295339	10300222	So apparently, right now, there is more interest in the Xbox Kinect.
10300692	10301173	TigerClaw TigerClaw
10317468	10322149	I played the volleyball game because the dodgeball wasn't demo-able.
10322629	10326370	It was cute, but I think it's more of a kid's game.
10326390	10326990	It's too simple.
10327270	10331451	It's basically Mario Tennis, but they just have a bunch of different sports re-skinned and stuff.
10331691	10335952	The basketball's kind of neat because it's a little bit like that Mario 3 on 3 basketball game they have on the DS.
10336852	10338653	Speaking of basketball, here's a game I didn't mention.
10338673	10341413	NBA Jam on the Wii was out there on the show floor.
10341433	10343514	It looked pretty awesome, I gotta say.
10344374	10345755	I'm very, I'm interested in it.
10346255	10347936	Yes, I'm interested in a sports game, OMG.
10348636	10357301	YYR in our chat room speaking on the Bobby Kotek story just said, says, Bobby Kotek, to increase our profit margins further, I would love to personally fuck all of our customers in the ass.
10358521	10359922	Of course they would have to pay me for it first.
10360262	10362163	I'm not sure how that increases profit margins.
10363063	10363904	Might increase something.
10364064	10372348	There's some pictures that came out showing the baby, babysitting mama controller, which looks like mama's head on a baby.
10373809	10382419	I guess, it's kind of creepy I want to say My Babysitting Mama That could be a song I got distracted, Rob
10382731	10387333	I think it would have been funnier if the baby mama had looked like cooking mama, but was black.
10388613	10389554	Rob, I got distracted.
10389754	10389954	What?
10390114	10390894	By our own wiki.
10391234	10391414	Why?
10391434	10392555	I found the Kmart page.
10393915	10394896	Our wiki's pretty awesome.
10394916	10395056	I know.
10395096	10408941	If you've never been to the Orange Lounge Radio wiki, you can either access it at orangeloungeradio.com, and then in the little box on the left-hand side, there's a W, or just go to orangeloungeradio.wikia, W-I-K-I-A dot com, and there's all this like...
10410362	10413687	And I mean that in the most positive, thankful way to our listeners that put it together.
10414167	10415208	Useless information about our show.
10415228	10416390	We need much more of that, too.
10417091	10420415	Did they ever put up our Never Forget?
10422017	10422637	I'm not sure.
10422677	10423378	I don't think so.
10423418	10424218	I don't know if I saw it.
10424698	10425658	You better seek that out.
10427779	10431120	TigerClaw says it was Bionic Commando Rearm 2 playable at E3.
10431901	10432821	Not out in the open.
10434221	10434481	No.
10435002	10436322	Capcom was showing off some other stuff.
10436742	10439443	Any other quick stories, Loki?
10439583	10444545	Dancer's Revolution X2 the arcade version will be out in Japan July 7th.
10444665	10446646	It's kind of neat, I guess.
10446706	10448246	Maybe we'll see it over here at some point.
10449407	10449487	Um...
10452481	10457151	and I think that's pretty much it.
10457672	10457992	Alright.
10458854	10473943	Well, before we get to the final thoughts, I've got to say this, because we've been so dominated with E3 news, I didn't have a chance to say this earlier in the show, so unfortunately it just was a bad week, but seriously, a very, very happy Father's Day to all the gaming daddies listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
10473963	10477024	I know there's a few of you, and I hope you had a wonderful Father's Day.
10477464	10479225	Loki, very soon to join those ranks.
10479506	10480346	Well, duh.
10480526	10481067	Again, yeah.
10481367	10481547	Yeah.
10482107	10485289	So, happy Father's Day to all the OLR daddies listening.
10486635	10489559	Now we're going to go around and get everybody's final thought and wrap up the show.
10489639	10491622	DarkSakura, your final thought for tonight.
10492123	10494086	Our wiki is awesome and needs more stuff.
10496108	10499591	My final thought is tacos are awesome and need more stuff.
10500231	10500532	Loki?
10501633	10506217	I need to paint the baby's room and I have a lot of work ahead of me.
10507278	10511182	Thank you guys so much for downloading our show and tuning in to Orange Lounge Radio.
10511322	10515986	All we ask and all we've asked for the past eight years, if you enjoy our show, just tell people about the show.
10516046	10518028	Help us spread the word of the show through word of mouth.
10518368	10538200	you know retweet and post links on Facebook and help us get more fans that's all we ask because we don't have a lot of marketing dollars or anything like that to pour into this show it would be nice if we had a million dollars but we don't and if you do get a million dollars apparently if you are a million dollar operation not only do you get invited to the conference but they'll just throw 360s at you who knew
10539252	10540715	So no, we really appreciate it, you guys.
10541096	10541917	Thank you guys so much.
10542198	10543200	Have a wonderful week.
10543280	10547448	Until next time, we will be back at Orange Mountain Radio for our 8th year anniversary.
10547488	10549311	But until then, have a wonderful week.

10551272	10554034	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

10579633	10580454	See you next week!
10601795	10623785	Okay so um something happened tonight that hasn't happened in uh 370 episodes of Orange Lounge Radio um that's pretty amazing or actually 371 episodes of Orange Lounge Radio we completely forgot the FUs of the week that we've been doing ever since episode one but Loki as the credits were rolling thank you Loki was like hey wait a minute we didn't do the FUs of the week
10625211	10634436	So, uh, thank God the recording is still recording and we can squeeze in right here at the very, very end the We Didn't Procrastinate FUs of the Week.
10651284	10652985	Um, no voice, fuck it.
10654426	10654786	Sucks.
10656610	10662032	My FU of the week goes to the fact, A, that I forgot the FUs of the week, and B, that I've been so tired.
10662112	10663752	I've been running on empty this week.
10663832	10668994	And just FU, no joke, to calling my phone.
10669014	10671855	I was up very late last night taking Shane to the airport, which is fine.
10671995	10672975	I volunteered to do that.
10673015	10673495	We had fun.
10673955	10677416	But FU to the unnamed individual who called my phone.
10677456	10682198	I am not exaggerating nine times this morning because I didn't answer the first pickup.
10683398	10685460	Seriously, that was excessive.
10686080	10687241	Knock it off, I'm trying to sleep.
10687701	10687961	Loki.
10689262	10690663	F you to Jury Duty.
10690943	10698308	I thankfully have dodged it for tomorrow, but I'm still on standby for possibly the day after, so it sucks.
10698528	10700310	I hate wasting my day at Jury Duty.
10700510	10703072	Also, I hate downtown Sacramento because I hate parking there.
10703292	10704933	Jury Duty's fun if it's like Law & Order.
10706704	10707564	But it never is.
10707624	10714146	It's like, hey, we're going to be having a four-month trial that talks about spousal abuse.
10714706	10715067	Guilty!
10715627	10716187	You're out.
10717467	10717827	All right.
10718368	10718908	There we go.
10718988	10721428	We fit in the FUs of the week just barely in the nick of time.
10721508	10723789	So now we can fade to black.
10723909	10726470	Good night, everybody, and thanks for listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
